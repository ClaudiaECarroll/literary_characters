SHANDON BELLS.
CHAPTER I.
"OVER RUNNING WATER.”
So still this night was. The white moonlight lay over the
sleeping world; the Atlantic was calm; the little harbour.
town of Inisheen, with all its picturesque squalor of quays
and creeks and stranded boats, had gone to rest; and here,
high up in this inland glen (from which the sea was visible
only as a sharp line of silver at the horizon), among the
felled trees and the brushwood, there was no sound save
the continuous “hush-sh-sh” of the streamlet far below
in the darkness. Nor was there any sign of life in this
open glade—not even a rabbit out browsing on the dew-
wet grass, or a curlew crossing the clear depths of the
blue-gray sky in its flight from the moor to the shore.
Only the moonlight shining calm and still on the wilderness
of bramble and bracken and furze, and here and there on
the white stump of a felled beech or ash; and always the
murmur, down below, of the unseen rivulet on its way to
the Blackwater and the sea.
But by-and-by, along the road over there, that was
barred across by the shadows of some tall elms, two people
came slowly walking, and the cheerful sound of their
speaking was clear in the stillness.
“The more I think of it,” said one of them, who was a
very pretty, slightly-formed young lady, with eyes as black
as the sloe, a mouth that could assume a most piquant
expression, and a voice that was soft and musical and
laughing,—“the more I think of it, this seems the most

SHANDON BELLS
extraordinary escapade I ever entered upon. Altogether
a most decorous proceeding! I suppose by this time every
soul in Inisheen is fast asleep; and no doubt Miss
Romayne is supposed to be asleep too—and dreaming of
the Conservatoire and her début at Covent Garden ; while
as for Master Willie, if he were to be missed, of course
they'd imagine that he was away after the wild-duck again;
so it would be all right for him. Sure I think,” she added,
altering her voice slightly, and speaking very shyly, “sure
I think 'tis I am the wild-duck that Masther Willie is afther."
“Do you know, Kitty,” said her companion, who was
taller and fairer than she, a young fellow of two-and-twenty,
perhaps, with light-brown wavy hair, the shrewdest of clear
blue eyes, and a well-set, slim figure,—“do you know, Kitty,
when you speak in our Irish way like that, my heart is
just full of love for you.”
“Oh, indeed !” she said, in a tone of surprise. “Oh,
indeed. And at other times what is it full of, then ?"
“Well, at other times," he said, “at other times, you
see— well, at other times, Kitty, do you know, it is just
full of love for you. Never mind. When I go to England
I'll soon get rid of the Cork accent; and when I come
back to you, Kitty "
“Indeed you may save yourself the trouble,” she inter-
posed promptly. “I am not going to have any stranger
come back to me. I am going to have nobody but my
wild Irish boy, with whatever accent he has, and with all
the-the-cheek he is not likely to get rid of anywhere.
There's no other word for it, I declare. Such cheek as
never was heard of! Do you know, sir, that I sang at the
Crystal Palace with Titiens and Santley ?”
“You've reminded me of it pretty often, Kitty," was
the meek reply.
“Yes; and Miss Catherine Romayne, who has sent all
Dublin wild with her singing of Irish songs, who could
make engagements all over Ireland for the rest of her
natural life, comes to Cork—to find herself patronised by
the Cork Chronicle! The Cork Chronicle, indeed! And
it isn't the editor, mind you, but only the sub-editor-does
he sweep out the office, too ?—that has undertaken to sing

"OVER RUNNING WATER”
the praises of Miss Romayne, and make the whole country
understand what a wonder she is! Dear me, what beau-
tiful language! It has been reserved for an English singer
to reveal to the Irish people the pathos of 'The Bells of
Shandon.' Truly! What did they think the song was,
then? Did they think it was comic? Then came the
usual thing—I foresaw it from the beautiful writing in the
Cork Chronicle—bouquets; complimentary notes; finally
an introduction; and behold! the sub-editor of the Chron-
icle isn't in the least a pale youth with long hair and inky
fingers, but rather half a young gamekeeper and half a
young squireen and the remainder a fair-haired Apollo
Belvedere with a delightful accent and the most ingenuous
blush. And oh, such innocence ! and oh, such modesty!
Modesty! ‘May he be permitted to call ?' And the very
next day, as Miss Romayne and her faithful guardian are
seated at their midday meal, there's a knock at the door;
and enter Mr. Modesty! Bless the man, I said to myself,
doesn't he know what's what, but he must pay an afternoon
call at two o'clock in the day? Anybody in his senses
would have backed out; but you weren't the least in your
senses—confess it now, Willie !-
“Were you ?—when you found your pretty black hair
was all about your shoulders, and bottled stout on the
table? And would Mr. Fitzgerald sit down and have
some lunch ?' and 'would Mr. Fitzgerald prefer a glass of
sherry ?' At all events you were civil-mannered then,
Kitty."
This was carrying the war into the enemy's country;
but she paid no heed.
“I think you grew more happy, Willie, when I went to
the piano and so got my back turned on you, and when
you grew more audacious in your flattery—there was
something about Tara's harp being awakened again—and
then-there was a moment-after that 'Bells of Shandon'
that you would have—I think there was a moment when I
chanced to turn, and I fancied young Mr. Gamekeeper's
clear blue eyes weren't quite so clear as usual-can you
tell. me?"


## p. 4 (#16) ###############################################

SHANDON BELLS
"It seems a long time ago," he said absently, “though
it isn't. Can you tell me, Kitty, why it is that Miss Patience,
who was so friendly with me at first, took it into her head
to quarrel with me?”.
“Why, you quarrelled with her !”
“Nonsense; I did nothing of the sort,” he said, with a
laugh. “But when her manner changed all of a sudden
and she practically forbade me the house, of course I took
the hint."
“And a nice position both of you have put me into.
But mind you, Master Willie, whether you had been going
to England or not, this must have been the last of these
hole-and-corner meetings. Moonlight walks are very
pleasant; but—but it won't do, you know, especially for
one placed as I am. There is such a thing as propriety,
though you don't seem to think so. And now I suppose
this one is to be the most fatal of all, with witcheries, and
enchantments, and what not. By the way,” she added,
stopping short in the road, and looking him straight in the
face, “how do I know what you mayn't be making me
promise? When you repeated some of the gibberish the
other night of course I couldn't understand a word.”
“Don't be alarmed, Kitty; I will put it all into English
for you. And we are close by the place now; if you will
step over this bit of the wall, I will take you down into the
gler de hele one we bed above the shoe
He helped her over the low moss-grown wall, and they
emerged from under the shadow of the elms into the clear
open glade described above. Her face, which was unusually
expressive by reason of those soft, large, sloe-black eyes,
was more serious now. She glanced up and down the
wooded valley, lying all white in the moonlight, and then
said to him, almost in a whisper-
“Is this where you said the saints shut up Don Fierna
and the pixies ?”
“No," he said, “ that was away over there in the
mountains. But they say the little people can get out
into this valley; and you won't catch many of the Inisheen
natives about here after dark. Farther up the glen there
is a very curious echo; of course that is Don Fierna
and the post he But the you won't Farti

answering you when you call to him. But they don't like
to speak of such things about here; the priests are against
it.”
“And the well?”
“It is down there,” he answered, pointing to the narrow
ravine which seemed jet black below them.
“Oh, I can't go down there, Willie,” she said, almost
shuddering.
“It is very easy,” he answered cheerfully, to reassure
her. “And you won't find it dark when once you are
down. Give me your hand, Kitty; hold tight, and watch
Ste you put yo, your hands it dark werfully, to
Slowly and cautiously they made their way down the
side of the chasm, through the bracken and furze and
tangled underwood, until at last they reached the bed of
the streamlet at a point where the water tumbled into a
natural basin that had been worn out of the rock. Nor
was it quite so dark as it had appeared from above. The
bushes around them were quite black, it is true ; but the
clear sky far overhead lent a reflected light that touched
here and there the falling water and the troubled pool with
a wan gleam. It was strange that the noise of the brook
appeared to make no impression on the sound of their
voices. This seemed to be an absolute silence in which
they spoke.
He stepped across the water she remaining on this
side; and then he reached his hand to her.
“Give me your hand, Kitty.”
She did so in silence. Their outstretched hands were
clasped together over the stream.
"You must repeat to me what I say to you—it is quite
simple, Kitty. Don't be afraid.” (For he thought she was
trembling somewhat.) “ Over running water : My love I
give to you; my life I pledge to you ; my heart I take not
back from you, while this water runs.”
He listened for her voice ; it was scarcely audible.
“Over running water: My love I give to you," she said;
“my life I pledge to you; my heart I take not back from
you, while this water runs. Willie, it is not hard to promise
that I will say it again if you wish me to.'


## p. 6 (#18) ###############################################

SHANDON BELLS
“ Listen, Kity. Over running water: Every seventh
year, at this time of the year, at this time of the night, I will
meet you at this well, to renew my troth to you : death alone
to relieve me from this vow."
She repeated the words without faltering.
“And this is the last, Kitty. Over running water : A
curse on the one that fails; and a curse on any that shall try
to come between us two; and grief to be a guest in their house,
and sorrow to dwell in their house for ever."
“Oh no, not that, Willie !” she cried, almost piteously.
“Let this be a love night! Don't let there be any hatred
in it. I don't mind the rest—but not that !”.
He did not answer; he held her hand in silence.
“Well, if you want me to, I will. Tell me the words
again."
No sooner was the ceremony, or charm, or whatever it
might be called, completed, than he leapt across the little
stream, and caught her in his arms, and kissed her.
“Now you are mine, Kitty! Bell, book, and candle
can't divide us now. But why are you trembling? You
are not afraid ?—you who are afraid of nothing! Come,
we will clamber up again into the moonlight; you know it
Don Fierna has let any of his little people out, you would
never get a glimpse of them away down here. Wouldn't
it be fine to see the procession come down through the
bracken-
* Trooping all together,
Green Jacket, Red Cap,
And White Owl's Feather.'
-Kitty, what is the matter with you ?”
“Yes, let us get away,” she said in a low voice. “I
want to be up in the light-give me your hand, Willie.”
So he helped her to clamber up through the brushwood
again until they got into the moonlight; and as they made
for the road, he noticed that she glanced back for a second
-a hasty, frightened glance, it seemed—at the dark hollow
from which they had emerged. But he would not have
her frightened on such a night as this. He would have
nothing but gladness, and hope, and love-promises on such
a night. And she was very impressionable. Soon she

was laughing. Soon she was scolding him for not having
ordered a review of the little people for her beforehand.
Here she had come to the very headquarters of the elves
and the pixies; and not one to be seen.
“Oh yes, one,” she admitted. “I have indeed made
the acquaintance of one-on the beach this morning; and
a more extraordinary one Mr. Doyle never drew. You
know him, Willie—at least he says he knows you very well-
a little man with wild red hair, and a tall hat, and a gray
jacket with scarlet sleeves,
“Why, it's Andy the Hopper. Had he his pole with
him?"
“What pole ?”
“ The leaping-pole he has for taking short cuts across the
bog," said he, greatly delighted to see her so cheerful again.
“I didn't see any pole. But I made out very soon
that he was intimately acquainted with you; and so I
thought I might as well get some independent testimony
about the character of my husband that is to be. Oh, I
assure you I was most discreet. Andy the Hopper, if that
is his name, had very little notion why I wanted to know
this or that about the Fitzgeralds, and especially about
Mr. William Fitzgerald. Would you like to know how he
described you, Willie ?”.
“If Andy the Hopper has been saying anything against
me-I mean to you, Kitty,—I'll beat the blackguard with
his own pole till there's not an inch of whole skin on him,"
was her companion's decisive reply.
"Is it Masther Willie ye mane ?' he said. I said it
was. 'Sure, miss, 'tis the duck's back that Masther Willie
has got, and trouble runs off it like water. At the very ind
of the day if he was to lose the biggest salmon ever hooked
in the Blackwater, d'ye think he'd be afther sittin' down
and cryin'? Divil a bit-begging your pardon, miss.
He'd be whistlin' the ould tunes as he put up the rod;
and then away home wid his spaches and his singing and
his poethry, and a laugh and a joke for all the gyurls that
he'd meet. Glory be to God, miss, but 'tis Masther Willie
has the light heart.' But wait a moment, Master Willie.
I thought that phrase about the gyurls a little singular.
bien meady the Hepsi


## p. 8 (#20) ###############################################

SHANDON BELLS
Or rather it isn't singular, for it's plural. How many
gyurls is an Irish young gentleman supposed to be in love
with at the same time? Don't I know the song-
Here's a health to the girls that we loved long ago
Where the Shannon, and Liffey, and Blackwater flow'
-Why 'girls ?!"
“Why not, Kitty? The song is about the Irish Brigade.
You wouldn't have the whole brigade in love with one ?”
“I don't know; it sounds suspicious; and I suppose
we are not more than a stone's throw from the Blackwater
now. But you may reassure yourself, Master Willie. I
wils very discreet. I put no questions about the gyurls to
the gentleman in the red-sleeved jacket; and so he went
on to say you were a great sportsman, and to give me many
stories of midnight adventures you and he had had together,
after the wild-fowl.”
“That's all over now, Kitty,” said he, looking away
across to the shallows and the mud-flats of the wide bay of
Inisheen, where many a time he had brought a mallard
thumping down, or listened to the clang of a string of wild-
geese far overhead in the dark. “London is a terrible
place to be alone in. I remember the first time I went
there, and saw the miles and miles of streets and houses,
and the strange faces, and the crowds hurrying and hurrying
and hurrying, I said to myself I should lose heart altogether
if I were to find myself alone in such a tremendous ocean,
fighting to keep my head above water. Better the Cork
Chronicle; and an ambition limited to the publishing of
one small volume of poems some day; and, for the rest of
it, over the bog after snipe, or up the mountain after hares,
with Andy the Hopper. And then you must needs come
along, Kitty, and spoil all my content. Even now I fear I
am going to London against my better judgment. Having
yoni, Kitty, what do I want with fame or money ?”.
“Stuff. I know you are fearfully ambitious, Master
Willie, though you won't own it. Would you like to go on
for ever as the sub-editor of the Cork Chronicle ? Would
you have me keep singing away at concerts until my little
share of good looks was gone, and then the public would

discover there was nothing in my singing at all? I am
certain your philosophy is all pretence. I don't believe
Andy the Hopper a bit when he says you'd only whistle an
ould tune or spake poethry after losing a big fish ; I believe
you would be much nearer crying with vexation. You
don't impose on me, Master Willie ; and we will see some
day whether London is too big for you to fight.”
“ If it was the old times, Kitty, and I could start with
a shield and a spear and your ribbon round my arm : that
would be something like the thing. But at any rate I can
carry your name in my heart.”
She stopped and took his head in her two hands, and
pulled it down and kissed him lightly on the forehead.
“That is where the victor's crown is to be,” she said.
“I am not thinking of any victor's crown," said he.
“I am thinking of the trip that you and I will make, every
seven years, to this old place of Inisheen, and our going
over the old walks again, and thinking of old times. And
the day may come, Kitty, when getting down that steep
bank may be too much for frail old limbs, and perhaps
Don Fierna will excuse us, if we make the pilgrimage, and
show him that we have not separated, even if we don't try
to go down to the well.”
“ Seven years," she said musingly. “It is a long time,
Willie-
But he did not hear her. He had stepped down to
unmoor a small boat that lay half hidden in the shadow of
a creek. When he was ready, he called to her; and then
he assisted her, with the most affectionate care, into the
stern of the boat, and pulled her shawl close at the neck,
and generally had her made comfortable. Then he took
the oars, and in a few moments they had shot out into the
broad and shallow and moonlit waters of the inner bay of
Inisheen. As yet they could talk together openly without
fear of being overheard from the shore : for Inisheen itself
-a tumbled mass of houses and quays and vessels---lay
away along there, between them and the Atlantic.
“Besides,” continued Miss Romayne, as if she had been
resuming some argument, “you say yourself this is such a
chance as you might never get again.”

“Well, it is a chance," he answered, slowly pulling away
at the short (and muffled) oars. “Fancy Hilton Clarke
being in Inisheen, and no one knowing it 1"
“Perhaps they were all as wise as I was, Willie, and
had never heard his name before !"
“You must have heard his name, Kitty," he said
impatiently. “Why, he is one of the most distinguished
men of letters in England— ”
“But what has he done, Willie ?"
“Oh, everything,” he said, rather confusedly. “Every
one knows who he is. There is scarcely a better-known
name in contemporary literature "
“But what has he done, Willie ? I might get it and
read it, you know."
“Why, he is one of the greatest critics of the day-
writes for all sorts of things there is no one better known.
He is said to have the finest judgment in literary matters of
almost anybody living; and the reviews that he writes are
always so scholarly, and-and-full of happy ingenuities of
expression—any one can recognise them— "
“Yes," said the pertinacious young lady with the pretty
mouth and the soft dark eyes, “but hasn't he done anything
himself? Hasn't he done any work of his own ? Couldn't
I buy a book of his, to let me know something more of
your wonderful hero ?”.
“Well, I believe he translated Les Fleurs du Mal—the
original edition-but the book was privately printed— ”
“I am sure I never heard of it, in English or anything
else," said she.
“Perhaps you never heard of Baudelaire either, Kitty,"
said he, gently. “You see it would be easy for you to
puzzle me about the distinguished people in music-I know
so little about what's going on in music.".
“Oh, very well,” said she, good-naturedly, “let him be
as distinguished as you like; that can't make him an agree-
able-looking man."
“I consider him very handsome,” he said in astonish-
ment.
“What —that lanky, supercilious, white-faced creature,
with his stony stare ?".


## p. 11 (#23) ##############################################

“OVER RUNNING WATER”
He burst out laughing.
“I do believe you're jealous, Kitty! Why, you only saw
him for a second, at the door of the Imperial, and you have
never spoken to him. I consider him an exceedingly fine
fellow, and the trouble he took about me—a perfect stranger
to him—was quite extraordinary. It was indeed a chance,
my running against him at all. You know, Kitty,” said he
-though there was a slight blush on his face—“I am not
ashamed of my father keeping an inn—or a public-house,
or whatever you may call it- "
“An inn!” she exclaimed. “A public-house ! The
Impayrial Hotel—the only hotel in Inisheen-to be talked
of like that !”
"—but all the same when I come here I don't go into
the smoking-room. It is always filled with these Coursing
Club people; and the Duke of Wellington wrenched,
killed, and won like a hero;' and Sweetbriar was 'slow
from the slips ;' and Timothy scored first turn;' and Miss
Maguire 'finished with the most lovely mill;' and all the
rest of the jargon. Indeed I'd rather go to another inn, if
there was one, when I come to Inisheen; but that might
vex my father. Well, this stranger I didn't meet at the inn
at all; but along the road : with his basket and rod and
gaff all complete ; and as we got talking about fishing, I
looked over his fly-book for him—all sorts of fantastic
nonsense got up in London to look pretty in a drawing-
room. Then I offered to show him some flies. Then it
turned out he was staying at the Imperial. And then we
had a long evening together-all contrariwise ; for I had
found out who he was, and I wanted to talk about all the
literary men in London-and he seemed to know every
one of them; but he wanted to talk about nothing but
river-trout and sea-trout and grilse and salmon, and the
different rivers in the neighbourhood. But it was a fine
evening, all the same; and he showed himself most friendly
—and has been so ever since, Miss Kitty, in his letters.
And just fancy his asking me, a young newspaper fellow in
Cork, to come and see him as soon as I get to London !
If you only knew the position he holds. But I think we'd
better be quiet now, Kitty, until we get past the town.”

SHANDON BELLS
Picturesque indeed was the old town of Inisheen on this
beautiful night—the moonlight shining on the windows of
the few houses on the side of the hill and on the gray
gables along the harbour, and causing the golden cock on the
top of the old Town Hall to gleam as if it were a repetition
of the beacon-light far away there on the cliff overlooking
the sea; while heavy masses of shadow lay over the various
creeks and quays, where broad-bottomed vessels had found
a berth in the ooze. But there was another Inisheen-an
Inisheen of new and trim villas—that formed a fashionable
watering-place fronting the open sea; and there it was that
Miss Romayne lodged ; and thither it was that Master
Willie was stealthily rowing. Indeed, they soon drew away
from the picturesque old town, and found before them the
gently murmuring Atlantic, that broke in a fringe of silver
foam all along the level sands.
And Miss Romayne was singing too—not with the fine
contralto voice that she could send ringing through a vast
hall, but humming to herself, as it were, in a low and gentle
fashion “Farewell ! but whenever you welcome the hour,"
and putting a good deal more pathos into the words than
appears there if one reads them in cold blood. For she
had a pathetic voice; and these two were alone under the
shining heavens and on the beautiful, calm sea ; and they
were young, and life and love were before them; and also
the tragic misery of parting.
“I will bid you the real good-bye to-night, Willie,” she
said, “and then I don't care for fifty Miss Patiences to-
morrow. You must put me ashore at the jetty; and I will
walk up alone. She is sure to be asleep. If not—then I
was restless, and had to go out for a walk. And you will
stop at the jetty, Willie, until you see me right up at the
house, in case Don Fierna and his little people should
snatch me up and carry me off to that dreadful glen."
“Why dreadful, Kitty? Are you sorry?”.
“Oh no—not sorry. But there is something unholy
about all that happened there. If that well were like the
other wells about, that the saints have blessed, there would
have been little bits of ribbon and suchlike offerings on
the bushes. There was nothing of that kind there. I

know I wouldn't go back alone to that valley for a million
pounds."
He rested one hand on the oars, and with the other
reached over and took hers.
“But I hope neither you nor I, Kitty, will ever find
ourselves there alone.”
He rowed in to the little jetty, and then stepped ashore
and assisted her to follow, on to the gray stones. The
leave-taking was a long one; there were many assurances
and asseverations, and a little hysterical crying on her part.
But at last the final good-bye had to come; and he put a
hand on each of her cheeks and held her head as though
he would read to the bottom of those soft, beautiful, tear-
bedimmed eyes.
“ You will never forget—you cannot forget—what you
promised me to-night, Kitty, when our hands were clasped
over the stream ?"
“Is it likely ?" she said, sobbing violently. “Is it likely
I shall forget, any single day as long as I live ?"
Then she went away alone, and he waited and watched
the solitary slight little figure go along the moonlit road,
and up to the house. There was a flutter of a white hand-
kerchief; he returned that signal. He waited again; there
was no sign. So he got into the boat again, and rowed
silently away to Inisheen harbour, like one in a dream.
Only a moonlight night, and the parting of two lovers.
And yet sometimes such things remain visible across the
years

CHAPTER II.
A HIGH CONCLAVE
Mr. Geutenant just nio his staff! had been accu
That was an eventful evening in the life of young Fitzgerald
when he made his way, not without some inward tremor,
to the Albany, in order to dine with Mr. Hilton Clarke.
For not only was that high honour in store for him, but
moreover this new friend, who had been exceedingly kind
to him in many ways, had promised he should also meet
Mr. Gifford, the editor of the Liberal Review. Imagine a
boy-lieutenant just joined asked to dine with the Com-
mander-in-Chief and his staff! Away in that provincial
newspaper office, Master Willie had been accustomed to
regard the London Liberal Review as perhaps the wisest
and most original and honest of modern journals; he had
many a time clipped out its opinions and quoted them
prominently in the Cork Chronicle; he had even from week
to week studied the way of writing that characterised its
columns. And here he was to meet the edilen actual
flesh and blood. To listen to the great critic and the great
journalist at once! Moreover, he could not help suspect-
ing that Hilton Clarke had arranged this meeting lest
peradventure it might be of some service, near or remote,
to the young aspirant. He did not know what he had
done to deserve such kindness, such good fortune. How
had it all come about? So far as he could see, merely
through his happening to know what were the best salmon-
flies for the Blackwater.
Of course he arrived too soon, înd so had plenty of
time to saunter up and down the echoing little thoroughfare

and master the lettering and numbering of the buildings.
But when, at last, he made his way up the stone staircase
to the door on the first landing, and was met by a tall
middle-aged woman with a foreign-looking cap on her head,
who, speaking in broken English, showed him where to
leave his hat and coat, and then ushered him into an apart-
ment the like of which he had never seen in his life before,
he began to ask himself if he had not made a mistake.
Perhaps he would again have demanded of the black-eyed,
soft-voiced, grave person if Mr. Hilton Clarke lived there,
but she had gone. However, it was clear that some one
was going to dine in this room; for in the middle of it was
a small square table very daintily laid out, and lit by a
lamp with a pink and white porcelain shade that threw a soft
rosy glow around. So at haphazard he sat down, and pro-
ceeded to gaze with a sort of awe at the wonderful chamber,
the treasures in which, if he had known anything about
them, he would have perceived to have come from all parts
of the world, but mostly from Venice. From Venice had
come the row of lustrous copper water-vessels that had been
transformed into big flower-pots and ranged along there
on the little balcony outside the French windows; also the
quaint and delicate white-and-gold chairs and couches that
were now dim with age; and perhaps, too, the framed
chalice-cloth over the chimney-piece, the beautiful rich
embroidery of which appeared to be falling away, by its
own weight, from the frail silken ground. But there was a
large inlaid Spanish cabinet in scarlet and lacquered brass
that was itself a blaze of colour; and there were Kairwan
rugs scattered about the floor; and on the walls were
gorgeous masses of Turkish embroidery; likewise a series of
candles in sconces, over each of which was hung a piece of
Hispano-Moresque pottery, the red glow from these large
dishes completing the barbaric splendour of the place. For
the rest, there was a good deal of Moorish metal- and ivory-
work about; but there was not a picture nor an engraving
on the walls, nor a book nor a newspaper anywhere.
Presently a door opened, and Hilton Clarke appeared.
“How are you, Fitzgerald ? Glad to see you."
There was a moment's pause.

“Oh, will you excuse me for a second ?”
As he disappeared into the bedroom again, a mighty
qualm shot to the heart of young Fitzgerald. His host
was in evening dress. He glanced at the table, which was
laid out for four ; no doubt the other two guests would be
in evening dress also ! The mere thought of it was agony.
It was not that they might consider him a country bump-
kin; it was that they might think him failing in due respect
to themselves. He had had no idea that London men of
letters lived like this. Even if he had brought his rusty old
suit of evening dress from Ireland, he would probably
never have thought of putting it on to go to dinner at a
bachelor's rooms. He wished himself a hundred miles
away from the place. He ought never to have accepted
an invitation to meet great people, until he had himself
done something. It served him right for his presumption.
And would they think it was out of disrespect ? Would it
be better for him to explain and apologise? Or to make
some excuse now, and get rapidly away?
In a very few minutes his host appeared again-in
morning costume.
“I think you're right, Fitzgerald,” he said carelessly, as
he flung himself into an easy-chair. “A shooting-coat will
be more comfortable; it's got quite chilly to-night.”
Fitzgerald's heart leapt up with gratitude. Was not
this, he asked himself, the action of a true gentleman-
an action prompted by an instinctive courtesy quick to
take into consideration the feelings of others ? He was
half-inclined to be angry with Kitty—poor Kitty, who was
so far away! But he would write to her: he would chal-
lenge her to say whether this little bit of courtesy, trifling
as it might appear, was not a safe indication of character.
And it must be confessed that Kitty was quite wilfully
wrong when she refused to perceive that her lover's new
acquaintance was handsome, and even distinguished-looking.
He was a man of about thirty, tall, sparely built ; his head
well set on square shoulders, his features refined and pen-
sive somewhat, with eyes of a clear light blue and calm and
contemplative; blond hair and beard (which he wore
somewhat long), and hands of extreme whiteness and

elegance. His beautifully-shaped nails, indeed, occupied
a good deal of his attention; and as he now lay back in
the easy-chair he was contemplating them rather than the
young man he was addressing.
“ There are some pretty things in the room, aren't
there?” he said in a tone of indifference, though he still
regarded his nails with care. “They are a bit too violent
in colour for me. I like repose in a room. But the capi-
talist will be impressed.”
. “I beg your pardon ?” said Fitzgerald (how glad he was
about that business of the shooting-coat !).
“ Oh,” he continued, in the same indifferent kind of
way, “I forgot I hadn't told you. There's a man coming
here to-night who has too much money. It isn't right for
a man to have so much money. I think I can induce him
to risk a little of it in a journalistic venture—I think so;
I don't know; the thing looks to me promising enough.
Only I thought my capitalist would be impressed with a
little grandeur ; and so I rented these rooms for a time.
I don't want you to think that all that scarlet and red
pottery kind of thing is what I should prefer. I like
repose in a room, as I say; something to quiet the eyes
when you are tired. Then the other man you will meet
-oh, I told you—Gifford. What a comical old cock he
is !"
Fitzgerald could scarce credit his ears. The editor of
the Liberal Review to be spoken of in this familiar and
patronising way.
"The odd thing is," continued Hilton Clarke, as he
slowly opened and shut a pencil-case with his beautiful
long nails, “that he has been able to get round about him
a lot of writers who are exactly like himself, or who pretend
to be. They are all fearfully in earnest; and dogmatic
about trifles; making the most profound discoveries in
new poets, new actresses, new politicians; always profess-
ing to be exceedingly accurate, and never able to quote
three figures without a blunder. The whole thing is
comical; but the public believe them to be so sincere.
To me they seem to be continually wandering in a fog;
and one stumbles against a lamp-post, and shrieks out :

“My gracious goodness, if this isn't the greatest genius of a
poet since the time of Byron !' and another tumbles on to
the pavement, where a beggar has been drawing chalk pic-
tures, and there's a wild cry from him too: 'Heaven pre-
serve my poor senses if this isn't Carpaccio come back
again. How can I express my emotion but in tears!' I
am told Gifford's last theory is that political disturbances
have the same origin as terrestrial disturbances; the earth
suffering from a surfeit of electricity, don't you know, or
some such thing, and firing off one half of it as an earth-
quake at Valparaiso, and the other half of it, at the same
moment, as an insurrection among the Poles. Different
forms of gas, I suppose. I wonder, when a number of the
Liberal Review is published here, what portentous explosion
takes place at the other side of the world. But there's
one good point about old Gifford; he is always very frank
in apologising for his blunders. You generally find him
saying: ‘Last week we inadvertently mentioned Lord
Russell as having been principally concerned in the
Abolition of the Corn Laws. Of course every one must
have seen that we meant the Duke of Wellington.' And
then the following week, “We last week, by a slip of the
pen, attributed the establishment of Free Trade to the
Duke of Wellington; every one must have seen that we
meant Sir Robert Peel.' I only hope he'll take it into his
head to discover a mare's nest in this new weekly I am
thinking of, and give us a flaming article about it; it's all
a toss-up whether he does or not.”
Fitzgerald heard all this with dismay; and even with a
trifle of pain. He was a born hero-worshipper; and for
this unknown editor, whose opinions he had reverenced for
many a year, he had a very high regard indeed. It was
almost shocking to hear him spoken of as a comical person.
But the truth was that Fitzgerald did not understand that
there was a spice of revenge in this tirade uttered so negli-
gently. Only that morning it had happened that a good-
natured friend had repeated to Mr. Hilton Clarke something
that had been said of him by Mr. Gifford. The good-
natured friend did not in the least mean to make mischief;
it was only a little joke; and indeed there was nothing

very terrible in what Mr. Gifford had said. “Clarke ?
Hilton Clarke, do you mean? Oh, he is the sort of man
who writes triolets, parts his hair down the middle, and
belongs to the Savile Club." Now there is no one of these
things absolutely criminal; in fact, a man might commit
them all and still be recognised as an honest British citizen.
Only, Mr. Hilton Clarke did not like to be ticketed and
passed on in that way; and so he took his earliest oppor-
tunity of revenge.
He looked at his watch.
“Five minutes past eight," he said. “Twenty minutes
late already. I never wait more than a quarter of an hour
for anybody ; so we will have dinner. Fiammetta ! Hola !
--Fiammetta !”
There was no answer, so he touched a little silver-
handled bell near him ; and the tall dark-eyed woman-
she seemed to have been very beautiful at one time, Fitz-
gerald thought, as he now had a better look at her—made
her appearance.
“L'on n'arrive pas, faîtes servir."
“ Bien, m'sieur.”
But at the same moment there was a noise outside in
the passage; and very shortly afterwards Fiammetta ushered
in two gentlemen. The first, who was rubbing his hands,
and looking very cheerful, was a portly, rubicund, blond
person, whose short yellow moustache and whiskers looked
almost white as contrasted with his round, red, shining
face; he wore one blazing diamond as a stud; and his
boots shone almost as brilliantly as the diamond did. Him
Fitzgerald instantly dismissed as of no account, and con-
centrated his eager interest on the next comer, who was
certainly of more striking appearance. He was a man of
middle height, of powerful build ; his face sallow; his hair
jet black and unkempt; his features strong, and yet keen
and intellectual ; his eyes so very clear, in the midst of a
dark face, that they resembled the eyes of a lion. The
general impression you would have gathered from his look
was that he was an intellectually powerful man, but unduly
aggressive; though this impression was modified by his voice
which was pleasant, and by his laugh which was delightful.

SHANDON BELLS
After the usual apologies and introductions, and when
Hilton Clarke had expressed his regret that these two guests
should have taken the trouble to come in evening dress (if
Kitty had only seen how nicely that was done !) they sat
down to the little square table; and Fiammetta-having
handed round a dish containing caviare, olives stuffed with
sardines, and similar condiments, offered to each of the
guests his choice of liqueurs. " As Fitzgerald had never
heard any of the names before—and as he was far more
interested in his companions than in the ministrations of
the soft-eyed and velvet-footed Fiammetta—he absently
answered “Yes, if you please," and did not even look at
the reddish-coloured fluid that was poured into his glass.
A minute afterwards he was brought to his senses. Having
observed the results of certain Coursing Club dinners at
Inisheen, he had long ago vowed to himself never to touch
spirits of any kind; and he had faithfully kept his vow.
But he never imagined that this reddish fluid could be
anything else than wine; and not particularly liking the
oily taste of the caviare, he thought he would remove it by
drinking this glass. The next moment he was convinced
that the roof of his head was off, and his throat on fire.
He hastily gulped down some water; fortunately he did
not choke ; no one noticed ; and by-and-by, somewhat
panting, and very red in the face, he was enabled to resume
his attitude of respectful and eager attention.
The conversation was entirely confined to Hilton Clarke
and Mr. Gifford; Mr. Scobell, the capitalist, being a most
valiant trencher-man, minded his own business. And
indeed for some time the remarks on affairs of the day and
on the doings of public men were somewhat obvious and
commonplace, if one may dare to say so; although here
and there occurred a suggestion that these two men had
very different ways of looking at things. However, all the
assertion was on the side of Mr. Gifford, whenever any dis-
putable subject was approached. His host did not care to
contradict. He would rather make some little facetious
remark, or shrug his shoulders. Gifford's attitude was one
of conviction and insistence; Clarke's might have been
summed up in the word “connu.” When the leonine

gentleman was vehemently declaring that the laureate's last
volume, which had been published that very week, was a
masterpiece; that never before had he written anything so
consistently dramatic in its conception, so musical in its
lyrics, so pathetic in its tragedy ; and that in consequence
life seemed to have had something added to it within these
last few days, his host remarked—while carefully looking
for bones in the red mullet—"Oh, yes, it is a pleasant sort
of poem.”
But, by dire mishap, they blundered into the American
Civil War, which was then a topic of more recent interest
than it is now. At first the remarks were only casual, and
perhaps also not profoundly novel.
" At all events," said Hilton Clarke at last, “there is
one point on which everybody is agreed—that the South-
erners have the advantage of being gentlemen.”
“The gentlemen of the Salisbury stockade—the gentle-
men of Andersonville !” retorted his opponent, with a flash
in the deep-set gray eyes.
“ And they fought gallantly, too, until they were beaten
back by the undisciplined crowds that poured down on
them-flung at them, indeed, by reckless generals, who
knew no more of the art of war than they did of common
humanity. Of course, if you have every advantage of men
and money and war-material---"
But this was like the letting in of waters. Even Mr.
Scobell looked up. For the Liberal Review had been a
warm partisan of the North during the war; and Mr. Gifford
had written nearly all of the war articles himself, so that
his information, whether precisely accurate or not, was of
mighty volume, and down it came on the head of his
opponent like a cataract. All the campaigns had to be
fought over again : now they were investing Vicksburg;
now they were marching through Georgia ; now they were
at Five Forks. Hilton Clarke appeared to have gone away
somewhere; he was scarcely heard amid all this thunder.
At times, it is true, he would utter some scornful taunt, not
levelled at the North only, but at North and South com-
bined; for indeed he might well be confused by all the
gunpowder smoke and noise. But even here he was not

safe ; for, having incidentally remarked that it was not
worth disputing about, "for after all,” he said, “there are
only two kinds of Americans, plain and coloured, and for
my part I prefer the coloured variety," he was immediately
pursued by his relentless enemy, who upbraided him for
making use of those idle little quips and taunts that made
such mischief between countries. The flippant article was
very easy to write, and the writer pocketed his three guineas;
and then it went out and was quoted all over America as
an expression of English jealousy. He undertook to say
that Clarke had never been in America ; he undertook to
say that he had never known twenty Americans in the whole
course of his life-
Now there is no saying how far this discussion might
have gone or how fierce it might have become ; but Mr.
Scobell made a remark. And when a capitalist speaks,
literary persons are silent.
“ I was once in America,” he said.
There was a pause.
“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Gifford, regarding him with
interest.
“Yes?"said his host, with a pleasant and inquiring smile.
But it appeared that that was all. He had contributed
his share to the conversation; and accordingly he returned
to his plate. Moreover, what he had contributed was
valuable; it was actual fact, which there was no gainsaying.
But whatever interest this dispute may have had for
young Fitzgerald as indicative of the characters of the dis-
putants (that is to say, supposing him to have had the
audacity to attempt to take the measure of two such
distinguished men), what followed turned out to have a far
more immediate and personal importance for him. The
champagne, which had been rather long in coming, had
now been passed round twice by the soft-footed Fiammetta;
a mellower atmosphere pervaded the room ; Mr. Gifford
was laughing pleasantly at a little joke of his host's; and
the round, clear, staring eyes of the capitalist—whose face,
by the way, had grown even a little redder, so that the
short yellow-white whiskers, and moustache, and eyebrows
looked as if they were afire-beamed in the most benign

manner on all and sundry. This was the time chosen by
Mr. Hilton Clarke to unfold the journalistic scheme which
had been the fons et origo of this little dinner-party.
“You see, I want your advice, Gifford,” he said, “and
Mr. Scobell won't mind my repeating some details that he
and I have gone over together. What I propose is a
shilling weekly-addressed to the wealthier classes, of
course, but rather with a view to country-houses. How-
ever, I should publish at three o'clock on Saturday, so that
London people could have the magazine by post, while the
country people would get it in their Sunday morning bag.
There might be a summary of Reuter's telegrams up to the
latest hour on Saturday ; otherwise, no news; and above
all no politics. The prominence given to politics in
English newspapers is founded on a delusion—wait a
minute, Gifford ; let me have my scheme out. I say that
the space given to politics in the newspapers is out of all
proportion to the interest taken in politics by any ordinary
English household. Outside political circles—I mean, apart
from those who are actually concerned in politics or in writ-
ing about them-take any household you like, and for one
who is deeply interested in politics you will find four who
don't care a brass farthing about them. Well, I propose to
address the four. But even the fifth, mind you, though he
may imagine himself responsible for the Empire, might have
anxious thoughts as to whether he should take such and
such a deer-forest in Scotland for the autumn, or whether
he should hire a steam-yacht and take his family for a cruise
about the Channel Islands, or whether, supposing he took
such and such a country-house from October till Christmas,
there would be as many pheasants this year as figured in
last year's bag, and so on; and he might be very glad, on
the Sunday morning, to sit down with his after-breakfast
cigar, in the verandah, you know, and study this honest
shilling counsellor-
“Oh," said Gifford. " That kind of thing. But there
is the Field ; there is Land and Water- "
“Pardon me, this will be quite different," said Hilton
Clarke, composedly. “I propose to have a series of agents

who will at their leisure send in faithful and unadorned
descriptions of anything they find that is worth having ; so
that Paterfamilias, instead of reading advertisements that
he can't believe, will have a lot of things offered to him—
a brace of perfectly disciplined setters, a thoroughbred
hunter, half a mile of salmon-fishing in Ireland, a shooting-
box in the Highlands, anything, in short, connected with
those delightful dreams of holidays that fill up the idle time
on Sundays with so many folk—and he will know that he
can safely depend on these being as they are described.
In fact, I don't know that we might not have a number of
supernumerary agents; so that a man, writing to the office,
could have one of these sent on commission, and so make
sure, for example, that the fine bag he had heard of as
having been made last year on a particular shooting did
not mean that the outgoing tenant had cleared every head
of game off the place. The difficulty will be to get per-
fectly trustworthy agents; we shall be above suspicion ; for
we shall take no fees, no commissions. The men must be
well paid- ”
“Right,” said Mr. Scobell, and there was instant atten-
tion. But that was all. He looked from one to the other
in silence; he had said all he had thought it necessary to say.
“My dear Gifford, not an ortolan ?” Hilton Clarke
observed with calm surprise. “Fitzgerald, pass the Bur-
gundy-gently, man !” he added, in a tone of displeasure,
for Fitzgerald had gripped the basket with his muscular
fingers as if it were the stock of a breechloader. “And
for this section,” he continued, “of course what is wanted
is a good sub-editor, who will put the reports into decent
English, and who won't let the printers make a fool of us.
Besides, he must know something of out-of-door sports
he must know a good deal more than I do—or we shall be
made ridiculous. I think it was rather lucky, then, that I
ran against my friend Fitzgerald here, for if you can per-
suade him, Mr. Scobell, to take the place, he is the very
man for it. He has burned powder in those desolate Irish
bogs, and I know he can dress a fly. And then, you see,
Fitzgerald, it needn't take up anything like the whole of
your time. You might be going on with more purely

literary work quite independently of it. What do you say :
—or would you rather consider ?"
“Oh, I should be very glad,” stammered Fitzgerald,
with his face about as red as Mr. Scobell's. “It is very
kind of you—1—I don't know whether I could do the
work—but I should try my best, anyway— "
"Oh, that's all right,” said Hilton Clarke, coolly. “I
daresay you know more about it than I do. As to terms,
perhaps this isn't the place to discuss these details— "
But here Mr. Scobell broke in. Here he had a right to
speak; and here he was on solid ground.
“I leave that in your hands, Clarke. I leave that to
you entirely. I want the paper well done. I want it to
be a gentlemanly paper. I don't want to go into my Club
and have a man come up to me and say, 'Scobell, what
d-d Radical trash that is in your paper. I wonder you'd
own a d-d Radical paper.' I want it to be a gentlemanly
paper; and I am willing to pay for it. I want it to be
well printed, on good paper; I want it to be a gentlemanly-
looking paper ; I don't want, when I go into sassiety, to
have people speaking of me as the owner of a d-d
Radical print.”
“Oh, of course not-of course not," said Hilton Clarke,
somewhat hastily. “There will be no politics. But we
must have a name, I have bothered my head for the last
fortnight about it. You see, I must have it known that
the paper is for Sunday morning, or for Sunday; but
everything I have tried suggests the Sunday at Home or
the Day of Rest, or something like that. I thought of the
Sunday Morning Cigar; but then everybody doesn't smoke.
The After-Breakfast Cigar, a Sunday Paper; that has the
same objection. The Country Gentleman's Guide ; that is
too long; besides, I want to appeal to the whole household;
and to town households also. Well, we must consider that
by-and-by.”
“If I were you, I would call it Jeshurun," said Mr.
Gifford. “ It seems to me you are addressing those who
have waxed fat; and taking account only of the most
material and vulgar luxuries. There is not a word of any
intellectual requirements

“Oh, I beg your pardon," his host said. “I have only
described one section to you. I mean to take the literary
section under my own care. Of course we shall have
essays, touching here and there on sport, perhaps; but
also meant to have an interest for the ladies in the house.
A short story now and again, if possible ; but it is difficult
to get them good; it might be better to have some French
novel—such as Monsieur de Camors— translated, and use
that as a serial. An occasional bit of verse, too, or a
ballade, touching affairs of the day. Professor Jewel has
offered me a series of translations from Horace partly
adapted to modern affairs; but I am afraid that has been
done too often.”
“Don't touch them,” said Gifford, with decision.
“Horace is as fatal to translators as Heine. Both are
quite unmanageable. Look how Milton made a fool of
himself with the fifth Ode.”
“What?" said Mr. Scobell, in a loud voice; and even
Fitzgerald stared.
“Come, you must not speak slightingly of the equator,”
Hilton Clarke said, with a laugh.
“Oh, but I do say it is the very worst translation ever
made from Horace, or from anybody else,” Mr Gifford
insisted. “It is not a question of degree. I say it is the
very worst translation ever made from anything; for it
starts with the primary defect of being absolutely unintelli-
gible. Do you mean to tell me that anybody unacquainted
with the original could make the slightest sense out of it?—

erred in the other direction, for he wanted to make it quite
clear what poor Gretchen was sorrowing about, and only
took a liberty with a little sie.”
“But what do you think of this project now, Gifford ?"
said Hilton Clarke, as he handed round cigars, coffee being
on the table.
Mr. Gifford took a cigar, lay back in his chair, and passed
his hand through the thick masses of his raven-black hair.
“Not much," said he, firmly. “You are combining
opposed tastes. Sportsmen are not as a rule fond of
intellectual pursuits. Where you find the library in a
country-house turned into a gunroom, there will be more
newly-made cartridges than newly-published books about.
A combination of Colonel Hawker and Joseph Addi-
son--"
“But, my dear fellow, you don't seem to see that I am
addressing different persons. I am addressing the whole
household—the father who wants to invite Lord Somebody
or other to shoot with him over a thoroughly well-preserved
moor in Scotland; the eldest son who hunts; the younger
son, who wants to cut a dash at Cowes; the mamma who
has her eye on several parties she could make up if only
she had a pleasant country-house for the winter ; the
young ladies who would be curious about a translated
French novel, as they are forbidden to read such things
in the original. You see I am appealing to the whole
household
“Call it the Household Magazine, then," said Gifford,
with a laugh.
"I will. Thanks,” said Hilton Clarke, calmly, as he
took out a beautifully-bound little note-book. “At least
that is better than anything I have thought of as yet."
And so Master Willie was installed as the sub-editor of
a shilling weekly magazine. But that was not the only
event of the evening, so far as concerned himself. After
talking about many things, until the gorgeous colours of

the chamber were pretty well subdued by a haze of pale
blue tobacco smoke, they chanced to touch on a novel
which had just then been published by a gentleman holding
a subordinate place in Her Majesty's Government. Rather,
it had been published some weeks before, anonymously ;
and no notice had been taken of it : now, however, a second
edition was announced, with the name of the Right Hon-
ourable Spencer Tollemache, M.P., on the title-page.
Then editors had to begin and overhaul the piles of books
put aside as adjudged not worth a review, and so “Daphne's
Shadow" came to the front again.
“Curious idea for Spencer Tollemache to write a novel,”
said Hilton Clarke. “His ‘History of the '32 Reform
Bill' was very well spoken of.”
“Ah; light literature—relaxation-relaxation," said Mr.
Scobell, smiling blandly, — " relaxation from the cares of
state.”
Gifford darted an almost angry glance at him.
“Light literature ?” he said, somewhat too scornfully.
“I suppose you mean light literature as distinguished from
the heavy literature that sinks? My dear Mr. Scobell,
where are the politicians of the time of Homer? Where
are the learned treatises they wrote ? It seems to me that
light literature-imaginative literature-pure story-telling-
absolute fiction—is the only really permanent thing of
man's invention in the world. The Siege of Troy, the
Wanderings of Ulysses, the Arabian Nights, Shakespere's
plays, Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe, the Vicar of Wake-
field-more than that, the children's fairy tales that have
an antiquity beyond anything that can be guessed at—all
pure fiction—these are the things that remain; these are
the things that the whole world treasures; while your
heavy literature sinks into the bog."
He was quite as vehement about this chance topic as
he had been about the American War.
“ You may call them will-o'-the-wisps, if you like ; they
are not to be caught and cooked; but they remain to
delight the curiosity and imagination of men, flickering and
beautiful; while far more useful works-solid and sub-
stantial works-have gone down into the morass and the

centuries have closed over them. People see too much of
the meaner side of what is around them; they wish to hear
of nobler things; they like a touch of rose-colour, of the
wonderful, the supernatural-added to the common things
of life. If a child had never been told about fairies, it
would invent fairies. And you talk of Spencer Tollemache
as turning to this kind of work for relaxation ? Perhaps he
may. I never read his History of the Reform Bill; but if
he thinks it easier to create imaginary human beings and
give them definite and natural form, and make them the
brothers and sisters and intimate friends of the people who
are actually alive in the world, if he thinks it is easier to do
that than to go to Parliamentary reports and Blue-books
and get together a useful compilation of easily-ascertained
facts, then perhaps he may find himself mistaken. Perhaps
he has already found himself mistaken. By Jove, it's
eleven o'clock,"
Good luck seemed to pursue Fitzgerald this evening.
When Mr. Scobell drove away in his carriage, the remaining
two guests left together on foot; and as they walked along
Piccadilly, Mr. Gifford must needs continue talking about
the Under Secretary's novel and the capitalist's chance
remark. You may imagine that young Fitzgerald was in
no hurry to interrupt him. To be walking with Mr. Gifford
was a sufficient honour; to listen to this vehement, combat-
ive, and occasionally brilliant and incisive talk was some-
thing that the provincial sub-editor had never dared to hope
for in this world. They walked all the way to Sloane
Street (Master Willie would have kept on to Jerusalem, had
not his companion stopped), when Mr. Gifford said to him—
"You live in the Fulham Road, you said ? My rooms
are close by here. I have been thinking now that if you
didn't mind trying your hand at a review of that novel I
was speaking of, you might let me have it by Thursday
night. Hilton Clarke showed me some things of yours.
You are on the right road; don't fall in with that affected
indifferentism; you'll find too much of it in London.
Remember Bishop Blougram :
“What can I gain on the denying side ?
Ice makes no conflagration.'

Your writing isn't quite clean enough yet. You go round
about. You don't hit the nail sharp and have done. No
matter; if you like to try your hand, you may have the
book.”
“But-” said Fitzgerald, almost deprived of breath,
"_but you don't mean for the Liberal Review ?"
“Of course I do."
Now if at this moment the pavement at the corner of
Sloane Street had opened, and if Master Willie had beheld
there a subterranean procession of Don Fierna and all his
array of elves-passing along in blue fire through grottoes
of felspar gemmed with rubies and diamonds—he could
not have been more astounded. That he should be asked
to write for the Liberal Review; and to write about a
book, too, that was at the moment occupying so much of
the attention of the public! He could scarcely find words
to express his sense of his companion's great kindness, and
of his own fears about his being unable to undertake such
a task.
"But I don't say I will use the article, mind,” said Mr.
Gifford, good-naturedly. “I will give you the chance, if
you will take the risk. It may be some training for you, in
any case. If you call or send to the office to-morrow you
will find the book waiting for you. Good-night. Glad to
have met you."

to
ecide in on his min beginning
FITZGERALD did not get to sleep soon that night. As he
walked rapidly away down the Fulham Road it seemed to
him as if five-and-thirty different ways of beginning this
fateful review were pressing in on his mind, and that he
had lost all power to decide which was preferable. If he
could have seen but the first page of the novel, it might
have given him some clue, perhaps. But here he was eagerly
and anxiously sketching out plans for reviewing a book of
the contents of which he was wholly ignorant; and it
appeared to him as if his brain had got the better of him
altogether and was running ahead in this aimless, distracted,
and fruitless fashion quite independently of his control.
At length he reached a dimly-lit little courtyard in the
Fulham Road, on one side of which stood a plain two-
storied building. The ground floor consisted of a large
studio; the upper floor served as a bedroom, and that Fitz-
gerald had secured as his lodging. He went carefully up the
outside stair ; unlocked the door ; lit a match and then a
lamp; and here he was in the middle of a fairly large low-
roofed apartment, somewhat scantily furnished, but quite
sufficiently so for all his wants. The floor was for the
most part bare : and here and there was a bit of faded
Turkey carpet or a withered old rug which had most likely
been flung out from the studio below as being even too worn
and decayed for painting purposes.
It was a fine place to think in, for there were few
temptations in the way of luxury about; and he had

plenty to think of. The projected magazine ; Kitty's
surprise on hearing the good news; the wonderful evening
he had just spent, and the strange contrast between the
two great men; nay, precise conversation of which he
could remember every word-all these things were enough
to occupy him ; but nearer than any of them came this
pressing matter of the review. What a chance it was! And
they said that London was an unfriendly city! Now it
could not be any interest in salmon-flies that had led Mr.
Gifford to place this opportunity before one who was quite
unknown to him. True, Mr. Gifford had seen certain
excerpts from the Cork Chronicle which Mr. Hilton Clarke
had asked to be entrusted with (N.B. What would Kitty
say to this? Was not that the act of a friend ?), but
Fitzgerald had a great distrust of himself; he had not
regarded these things as of much value ; and certainly he
had never thought they would entitle him to have the
chance given him of contributing to the Liberal Review.
At this moment all his thinking went clean out of his
head; for there was a tremendous noise below—the noise
of a powerful raucous bass voice that bellowed, or rather
that rattled with the rattle of small drums-
“Should auld acquaintance be forrrrr-got.”
“There's that brute begun again,” said Fitzgerald to
himself, with a groan.
But the brute, whoever he was, seemed to have no
intention of continuing the song. There was a dead
silence, in the course of which Fitzgerald speedily recovered
his thoughts again.
And first of all he was determined that, if the book
gave him any fair excuse, the review should be a friendly
and good-natured one. For he had carefully noted cer-
tain remarks (what had he not carefully noted during
that momentous evening ?) that Mr. Gifford had addressed
to Hilton Clarke with regard to the projected magazine.
“For one thing, my friend,” Mr. Gifford had said,
bending his keen eyes on the tall blond-bearded gentleman
opposite him, “I would advise you, in going over to this
new thing, to leave behind you the affected pessimism of

the Weekly Gazette” (this was a weekly journal to which
Mr. Hilton Clarke was understood to contribute). “That
continual belittling of things; that continual discontent
with everything that turns up in politics or literature or art,
does not pay. It is not wise. When the public find you
always discontented, always looking at the hopeless side of
things, always declaring that everything is going to the bad,
they begin to suspect that you have reason for this discon-
tent—in other words that your circulation is decreasing,
Now that is a fatal impression. Besides people will not
read a paper that fills them with gloom. Nor can you
bully the public with impunity. It is no use attacking
them, and scolding them, or treating them with scorn and
contempt.. You see, the public have simply to leave
you unread, and that is a terrible business ; for then, you
perceive, you cannot hurt them, but they do hurt you.”
“I should have thought,” said Hilton Clarke, with a
gentle smile," that the circulation of the Weekly Gazette
was somewhat bigger, a little bit bigger, than that of the
Liberal Review.”
“ Yes; no doubt, no doubt,” said the other, cheerfully,
“though I am in hopes of seeing their relative positions
reversed some day. But that is my advice to you. That
tone of disappointment with everything makes people begin
to think that you are not getting on as well as you might
be; and that is very bad. Then the advertisers. Mind
you, the advertisers are also vertebrate animals, and they
make up a considerable proportion of the public. And if
you go on from week to week declaring that British
tradesmen are universally swindlers, that railway directors
should be indicted for wilful murder, and so forth, mind
you, your advertising agent may have a bad time of it.
Say he goes into a big cutlery place in Oxford Street.
The foreman goes up to the master, 'Here is the advertise-
ment man from the Weekly Gazette, sir; he wants us to
take the outside page next week.' Then very likely the
cutler may turn round and say, "The Weekly Gazette be
hanged! Tell him that swindling isn't paying well just
now, and we can't advertise. Swindlers, indeed! Swindlers
themselves! The Weekly Gazette be hanged !!”

this advice TANDON

SIIANDON BELLS
Now this advice, though it seemed to young Fitzgerald
at the time to be not quite in accordance with the ruat
cælum principles professed by the Liberal Review (which
was a very courageous, and vehement, and plain-spoken
organ), nevertheless appeared to him to be sound and
sensible. Accordingly he now resolved that, if the merits
of the book permitted it at all, he would treat it in the
most friendly fashion. Instead of scourging him with rods
from out the groves of Academe, the Liberal Review would
take this new disciple by the hand and encourage him, and
bid him be of good cheer. Or what, if the book were very
good indeed, and altogether beyond need of patronage ?
Then let literature be congratulated on this new adhesion !
Fitzgerald remembered that the Liberal Review was rather
fond of making discoveries. No reviews of the book, at
least of any importance, had appeared, though people were
talking enough about it. Might not he be the first to
announce the advent of a new power in literature? If he
only had the book-here-at once-
"And never brought to mind ?"
-again came the giant roar from below. And what a
tenacious memory the musician must have, was Fitzgerald's
first thought; ten minutes certainly having elapsed since
he sang the first line. And surely there must be some
shaft or opening in the floor, otherwise the sound could not
come through in such volume? And what if perchance
that shaft should be over the musician's head, on which a
bucket of water might be made to descend suddenly at the
next bellow ?
But there was to be no more bellowing—except, indeed,
a verse of the National Anthem, which Fitzgerald had
already learned to recognise as the token that the artist was
about to retire for the night, pleased or not, as the case
might be, with his work. “ G-0-0-0-d sa-ave the Qui-e-e-n!”
roared the deep bass voice in dying cadence: then there
was a curious clamping and shuffling, as if some one were
doing a heel-and-toe step on a wooden floor ; then silence.
Either the artist was having a final pipe, or he had gone to
bed.

Next morning eleven o'clock was the earliest hour at
which Fitzgerald deemed it fitting he should go to the office
of the Liberal Review for the book; and even then he did
not think it probable that Mr. Gifford could have sent a
message so soon. To his surprise, however, there the
precious parcel was awaiting him; and so eager was he to
see what sort of material this was on which he was to
operate, that the moment he got on the top of the first
passing Fulham omnibus he hastily undid the parcel, put
two volumes in his pocket, and proceeded to cut the leaves
of the other. He glanced over the first page or two-very
good; a sort of playful introduction ; light, facetious, well
written; in short, a clever little essay about a country-house
and its guests in the hunting season. But the reviewer
was more anxious to get to the people; and these turned
out to be, in the first instance, the three daughters of a
Duchess, who were at the same moment in their respective
dressing-rooms and each imparting confidences to her maid.
It was ingeniously arranged that these confidences should
be reported in turn; and there was a very comical similarity
among them, seeing that they all referred to a youthful
marquis of vast possessions who was to arrive at the house
that evening, and to the probable effect on him of certain
costumes and styles of dressing the hair.
Now Fitzgerald knew a great deal more about the habits
of a “stand” of golden plover than about the ways and
speech of Duchess's daughters; but he soon began to form
the impression, and much to his disappointment, that all
this artificial talk, clever as it might be, was entirely
impossible in the circumstances. Nay, he began to feel
just a touch of resentment that three young English women
of good birth and breeding should have been represented
as exhibiting themselves, to their own domestics, as so
many flippant and giggling barmaids. It is true that
Fitzgerald's father kept a small country hotel (and even that
he did unsuccessfully), but the Fitzgeralds of Inisheen were
an old family, and had always been held of consequence in
that part of Ireland ; Master Willie had been accustomed
all his life to be addressed as “yer honour” when out over
bog and hill in search of game; and was himself possessed

SHANDON BELLS
of not a little faith in the virtues of lineage and good blood.
And was it possible, he almost indignantly asked himself,
that any three young Englishwomen of decent parentage
and education-putting the Duchess out of the question
altogether-should have so little self-respect as to make
confidantes of their maids in this fashion, and reveal their
mean little schemes with the pertness of a soubrette in a
fifth-rate farce ?
He passed on, however, in hope. The marquis arrives
just in time to be sent off to dress for dinner. Then the
people of the neighbourhood who are coming to dine were
introduced ; and here there was some very fair humorous
sketching of a light kind; Fitzgerald marking down one or
two passages for approval. He read on and on-until he
arrived at the courtyard. He read on and on (not so
hopeful now) while his landlady brought him a chop, some
bread, and a glass of ale, his mid-day meal. He scarcely
paid heed to these things so busy was he with this book-
so anxious to make something out of it-o disappointed
at finding, with all the occasional smartness, the characters
not flesh and blood creatures at all, but mere ghosts. The
dry bones would not live. By four o'clock he had finished
the book; and he laid it down with a sigh.
Yet out of it he had to make an article somehow; more
than that, he was determined to have it done that very
night, so that the editor of the Liberal Review should see that
he could do his work promptly. So he set to work forth-
with; and laboured and laboured away to make something
out of the dry husks. Fortunately the bellowing gentleman
beneath was absent; and he could work on in silence.
The hours passed; he had a cup of tea. Finally, after much
correction and re-writing, he had a piece of work put together
which, if it did not form a highly interesting article, was,
he thought, as fair a judgment of the book as he could give.
Just then, it being nearly nine o'clock, the last post
brought him a letter, which he eagerly seized, for, though
he had heard from Kitty that morning, might she not have
taken it into her head-at the suggestion of her tender
heart—to send him another little note by some strange
means ? But this turned out to be from his father.

pocket; and that was the total of his worldly wealth
Had this letter come at any other moment it is possible he
might have thought it hard he should have to part with
that sum, or rather the greater part of it, to pay his father's
Coursing Club debts. But what did he care for a few
sovereigns when a fine career had just been opened before
him, with no other than Kitty as the final crown and
blushing and beautiful reward ? Here was his first contri-
bution to the Liberal Review ready to be deposited in the
letter-box. To-morrow he was to see Mr. Hilton Clarke
about the sub-editorship of the new magazine. And this
morning what was the message, written in that sprawling
but most lovable hand ?—"O, Willie, darling, make haste
and get on, and come back to me! And if your fine
friend introduces you to any of the beautiful London
ladies, just tell them there's a poor girl in Ireland that is
breaking her heart for your sake.” No; it was not at such
a moment he was going to consider the question of a few
pounds.
So he wrote
“MY DEAR FATHER—I have altogether now £38, of
which I send you £30, for Į must keep a small margin.

“Your affectionate son,
“WILLIAM FITZGERALD.”
That letter, of course, he could not send off just then ;
the money had to be made transferable first. But here was
this other one for Mr. Gifford—which from time to time
he regarded with a qualm of anxiety, not quite certain that,
after all, he had done his best. However, he resolved
that it was now too late for doubt; he took it up; sallied
forth into the night; sought out the nearest pillar letter-
box; and there deposited the fateful packet. That
decisive step once taken, his heart felt somewhat lighter.
The night was fine, and he went on aimlessly wandering,
along the gas-lit pavements; thinking of many things, but
mostly of Inisheen, and perhaps most of all of an inland
glen not far from there, and of running water, and of a
certain moonlight night. Was not this Kitty's soft, low,
trembling voice he could hear again in the silence ?—“My
love I give to you ; my life I pledge to you; my heart I take
not back from you, while this water runs." And perhaps
she also—far away there beyond the sea, up in the little
room overlooking the wide sands — was recalling these
words at this moment; and perhaps also shivering a little
as she thought of Don Fierna and his elves ?
It was nearly twelve o'clock when he returned to the
dim little courtyard; and he was very tired; and perhaps
the loneliness of this great dark world of London was
beginning to weigh on him ; so that he was glad to think
of his escape into the realms of sleep (where Kitty was
sometimes found walking about, with her soft black eyes
laughing, and her voice as glad as ever). But, as it turned
out, his adventures for that night were not just yet over.

CHAPTER IV.
A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.
FITZGERALD was just about to pass through the archway
leading into the courtyard when he heard a sudden
scuffling in front of him, and then a man's voice call out
“Help! help! police !” Instinctively he paused, for he
had no mind to enter into other people's squabbles; and
besides he could not well see what was going on. But his
appearance on the scene had no doubt produced some
effect; for before he had time to think, a man dashed
past him. Fitzgerald was in truth bewildered; he had
been dreaming of Inisheen; not thinking of midnight
robberies in London. And now he was inclined to let
well alone, and thank God he was rid of a knave, when
another dark figure dashed by—quite close by, indeed ;
and at the same moment he felt a sharp blow on his face.
This was too much. This brought him to his senses. He
did not know exactly where he had been struck; but he
knew that his face was tingling; he knew that he had a stout
oak staff in his hand, with a formidable knob at the end of
it; and the next thing he knew was that he was in full chase
down the Fulham Road, with the most un-Christian-like
determination to give as good as he had got, or even better.
The first man had disappeared, but this one was just
ahead ; and Fitzgerald was well aware that his only chance
was to overtake the fellow before he could dodge into some
byway or corner. Now the thief, or burglar, or whoever
he was, ran very well; but his muscles had not had that
training over rock and heather that his pursuer's had; and

SHANDON BELLS
the consequence was, that in a very short space of time
young Fitzgerald had so nearly overtaken his man (and was
so fearful of letting him escape) that he aimed a blow at
the back of the fellow's head with his stout oak staff. The
next minute Master Willie had nearly fallen over the body
of his prostrate foe; for down he had come, after that
sounding whack, prone on the pavement, where he lay
without a sign of life.
Then a third man came rushing up; and Fitzgerald
faced about, feeling now rather angry, and inclined to have
it out with the rogues of London generally. But he instantly
perceived that this little bare-headed, red-bearded man, who
now came wildly along, was no other than an artist whom
he had once or twice observed going into the studio below
his bedroom.
“You've got him ?” he called out, in great excitement;
"you've got one o' them ?”
“Yes, I've got him," answered Fitzgerald, “and now
I've got him, I'd like to know what to do with him."
“ The scoundrels !” said the other, breathlessly. “If
ye hadna come up, they'd have taken every penny I had
on me. Eh, man,” he added, staring at his rescuer, “ did
he hit ye ?—your face is a' bluidy.”
Fitzgerald had indeed felt something warm and moist
about his cheek and chin; and when he had put his hand-
kerchief up to his face he could see by the dim gaslight
that he must have been bleeding pretty freely.
“Yes, he did ; and I think I hit him too_unless he's
shamming. You go and get a policeman; and I'll wait
here by this fellow. If he becomes unruly I'll give him
another taste of my kipeen."
The red-haired artist left rapidly, and in a few seconds
returned not only with one, but two policemen whom he
had found talking together, and into whose ears he was
now pouring the whole story of how it had happened.
Just as they came up, the man on the pavement slowly
raised himself on his knees, and began to rub the back of
his head.
“Who done that ?” he muttered, as if he were not quite
awake,

A NEW ACQUAINTANCE

Then he seemed to collect himself somewhat; he looked
up and around; and perceiving the approaching policemen
he uttered the one word "copped,” and resigned himself
to his fate.
“Why, it's the Cobbler as I'm alive," said one of the
policemen, getting hold of him by the shoulder, and turn-
ing the apathetic face round to the gaslight. “He's been
wanted ever since that job in the Cromwell Road.”
“Now, look here, my good fellow,” said the Scotchman,
“I'm going to pick up my hat; I'm no going to the station
at this time o' night. Ye maun take my name and address,
and I'll come in the morning, and prefer the charge- "
“That'll do, sir; there's more nor one job agin this
man.”
“Off to the station, then, wi’ the scoundrel; and don't
lose your grip of him. If you, sir," he said, turning to
Fitzgerald, “will walk back as far as my studio, I will give
you a basin of water to wash your face in—it's the only
way I can thank ye.”
“Oh, but we are neighbours," said Fitzgerald. “I
know you well enough. You are the man who makes
such a frightful row with your Scotch songs.”
“Eh! how do you know that?” said the other, sharply.
“Because my room is just over your studio.”
“Bless me !—then you are the man that goes tramping
up and down all night-tramp, tramp-tramp, tramp—then
five minutes' rest—then tramp, tramp-tramp, tramp-up
and down-man, I've always pictured ye as a sort of
Eugene Aram, wringing your hands : I felt sure ye had
murdered somebody. Or a hyena in a cage. What do ye
gang on in that way for ?”.
“It's a bad habit, that is all.”
. “But what's your business ?" said the other, bluntly.
“I write for newspapers.”
“I did not think that was such hard work. It must
cost ye a lot in shoe-leather," said the Scotchman, drily.
“However, when I've got my hat, ye maun come in and
have a glass; I was just getting back to my supper, when
they scoundrels grippet me. I wish I had a candle. I'm
thinking the police, now we've handed over to them such

a notorious creeminal, might give us another gas-lamp in
this infernal dark yaird.”
Without the aid of a candle, however, he soon picked
up his hat; then he led the way into a hollow-sounding
and apparently spacious room; lit the gas, and forthwith
proceeded to get his companion some fresh water with
which to wash his face. And while Fitzgerald, who found
that the bleeding had proceeded merely from the nose, and
that he was not cut at all, was performing that operation,
the Scotchman, with a smartness which showed that he was
familiar with the exigencies of camping out, had lit a little
gas-stove, produced some tinned meat, and put a quite
snow-white table-cloth on a small table, with some glasses,
plates, knives, and forks.
“Now we'll have a bit of supper, and a crack," said he,
“since we're neighbours. Will I make ye a dish of hot
soup ?-Five minutes will do it.”
“Oh no, thank you," said young Fitzgerald, who was
much taken with the frankness of this short, broad-
shouldered, red-bearded, and keen-eyed person. " That
tinned beef will do capitally for me. But what I should
like better than anything," he said, casting his eyes round
the big, gaunt, and dusty studio, which had very little fur-
niture beyond the heaps of canvases all ranged with their
faces to the wall, “would be to have a look at your pictures."
“My pictures ?" said the other. “Oh yes. As ye’re a
newspaper-man, ye're no likely to be a buyer."
“ You would rather not show them to a buyer, then ?"
“ There is nothing in the wide world I hate so much,"
-said the other, busying himself with the table, "little
experience as I have of it. I don't mind criticism—the
sharper the more likely I am to get something out of it.
But the valuation in money—that's what gangs against the
grain. Come, sit down, man; ye're none the worse for
the stroke on the nose. The water is near boiling already:
and ye'll have a glass of toddy. Here's the bottle, and
there's the sugar.”
“Thank you; but I don't drink whisky."
“Hwhat !” shouted the red-bearded artist, nearly letting
the bottle fall. “Hwhat d'ye say? "

“ But I've got some beer overhead. I will fetch some
in a minute "
“Gude preserve us, laddie ; but if it's ale ye want, there's
a bottle or two in the corner. What's your name, by the
way ?”
“ Fitzgerald.”
“ Mine's Ross. John Ross. Fall to, man; there's no
use wasting time over meat when there's a pipe and a glass
o'toddy to follow."
Fitzgerald soon found out that he was excessively hungry,
and as the cold beef and the bottled ale were alike excellent,
he did ample justice to both, while with equanimity he sub-
mitted to be examined and cross-examined by this frankly
downright acquaintance.
“You're one o' the lucky ones, I can see,” said Ross,
when Fitzgerald had told him how his literary prospects
were. “Ye've fallen on your feet just at once. Here have
I been in London near six years, and I havena sold as
many pictures as I have sold in two seasons when I was
pentin' in Perthshire in a caravan. But bless ye, what does
it matter ?” he continued with cheerful good-humour; “I
have all the more pictures to sell when I do fall on my
feet. I envy nobody, so long as I can get a crust of bread,
for I reckon on my time coming."
“Of course if you were to get into the Academy, your
pictures would have a great additional value, I suppose,”
Fitzgerald observed.
“The Academy ?” said John Ross, with a stare. “Do
ye mean me becoming a member of the Academy ?”
“Of course. Isn't that the natural ambition of every
artist ?" said his new acquaintance.
“Oh, but that's luck beyond anything I'm thinking of,"
said the other imperturbably, as he proceeded to pour out
some scalding hot water on a couple of lumps of sugar.
“Just think of all the men there are pentin', and the
chances of any one of them getting such a stroke of luck
as that. No, no; all I hope for is that they who are in
the Academy would be a bit friendly. If there's any one
bears them a grudge, it's no me; if the chance happened
my way, wouldn't I take it? and how can I blame them ?


## p. 44 (#56) ##############################################

SHANDON BELLS
No; the bit of luck I hope for is to get a good place some
day on the walls ; and that is no easy, if you think of all
the people who want to be hung. They did hang one o'
mine last year, but it was away at the roof; so you see my
line of luck is no clear before me yet, and yours is.”
“But I have only the chance," said Fitzgerald. “Since
I have come to London I haven't earned a penny, as far as
I know."
"Hear till him! Man, ye've everything before ye.
Ye've all the train nicely laid ; ye've only to light the match,
and whaff goes the pouther!”
By this time they had both lit their pipes, and John
Ross went on to talk about his own art in a way that very
soon astonished his companion. Whether he could paint
or not was still, so far as his companion was concerned, an
open question, but at least he could talk, and that in a
manner that was quite surprising. His vague, rambling
discourse, warming up now and again into enthusiasm, was
really eloquent, in a curious, bizarre, happy-go-lucky kind
of fashion ; full of figures, of quick, happy illustrations;
scornful at times, as he hit out right and left; and
occasionally describing an object as if he had flashed a ray
of sunshine on it. Fitzgerald was intensely interested, and
could have gone on for ever listening ; but at the same
time he could not help wondering what the actual work
was like of a man who was at one moment denouncing the
Pre-Raphaelites for their worship of sadness, their archaic
mannerisms, and their cast-iron hardness of form, and at
the next denouncing the French landscape-artists for their
fuzziness of detail, their trickiness, their evasion of daylight.
“It is not what I can do myself," he said at last, observ-
ing that Fitzgerald's eyes had strayed once or twice to the
canvases ; “it is what I know I should try to do. Suppose
you want to paint a field of ripe corn : will ye get at it, do
ye think, by sitting down and pentin' the stalks and the
heads—ay, if ye were to spend a lifetime at it, and paint
fifty thousand of them? Not one bit; if ye painted a hun-
dred thousand of them as like as like could be, ye'd be no
nearer getting at your cornfield. For what ye have to paint
is what ye see; and when ye look at a cornfield ye see nae

single stalks at all, but a great mass of gold, as it were, with
a touch of orange here, or paler yellow there, and a wash
of green where the land is wet, and sometimes of warm red,
even, where the stalks are mixed with weeds. · And ye are
no going to get that colour either by chasing the daylight
out of the sky, and taking the thing into a room, and mak-
ing a clever bit of a fuzzy French sketch in gray and green
and black. That's easy—but it's no the cornfield. Ay,
and there's more. Ye've got to paint more than ye see.
Ye've got to put just that something into the cornfield that
will make people's hearts warm to it when they see it on
your canvas. Suppose that ye've been ill for a month or
two; laid on your back, maybe, and sick tired of the pattern
on the walls o' your room ; and at last the day comes when
the doctor thinks you might be lifted into a carriage and
taken oot for a drive. And we'll say it's a fine warm after-
noon, and your heart is just full of wonder and gladness,
like, at the trees and the sunlight and the soft air ; and
we'll say that all of a sudden, at the turning o' the road, ye
come in sicht of this field of ripe corn, just as yellow as
yellow can be under the glow of the sky. Ay, and what is
it when ye see such a wonderful and beautiful thing—what
is it that brings the tears to your e’en? I say, what is it?
For it's that ye've got to catch and put in your picture; or
ye'll be a d-d mistake as a painter !”
Fitzgerald did not stay to ask him whether this was not
demanding that the landscape-painter should possess the
nervous system of an invalid (though, perhaps, something
might be said even for that theory, as applied to all forms
of art); he was much too interested to interrupt. But, by
a singular chance, Ross drifted away from painting altogether.
He was talking of the instinct for good colour that many
people had, who had no artistic training whatsoever, and by
accident he referred to fish and artificial flies, and so forth.
Fitzgerald looked up suddenly.
“ Are you a fisherman, too ?” he said quickly.
“ A wee bit. Are you ?”
“I have thrown a fly," said Fitzgerald, modestly, and
feeling in his pocket for a certain envelope.
“As I was saying, that's why I hold the salmon to be

the king o’ fish. He knows good colour. It's no use
trying him with your aniline dyes; yellow and scarlet and
gold—that's what he watches for ; whereas trout-ay, and
even sea-trout, are a mean, depraved, magenta-minded race
o'creatures. Man, I filled my basket last year in Perth-
shire wi' the most miserable puce things.".
“But what was the colour ?"
“Puce. A dirty, drab-lilac kind of thing it was. But
that was naething to the fly that was recommended me for
sea-trout in Argyleshire-ay, and it took too. Just think
of this—the body arsenic green worsted, with a bit of
white tinsel ; the hackle a purple blue; and the wings-
heaven knows where they came from, except it might have
been from a hoodie crow—a heedjous gray, like the colour
of a decayed corpse. Do ye think a salmon would have
looked at such a thing ?”
"Perhaps," said Master Willie, as he slowly drew out
an envelope from his pocket and put it on the table, “this
would be more to his liking ?”
“Eh, man !” said Ross, drawing out the great flies in all
their royal splendour of crimson silk, and yellow tinsel, and
golden pheasant feathers. “Where got ye them ?"
“I have been amusing myself making them for a friend
—the man I told you about; I could not think of any
other way of showing him I was sensible of his kindness."
“Ay, did ye make these yoursel'? Now that I think of
it, ye dinna look as if ye had spent a' your life in a news-
paper office.”
"I have spent most of it tramping over wild bogs and
on hillsides," said Fitzgerald, with a laugh. "A good deal
more than I should have done."
“Shooting ?”
6 Yes.”
“What sort ?"
“Oh, mostly wild-fowl; teal, snipe, wookcock, and so
on; chiefly in the winter."
“ Hard work, then”
But here the conversation went far afield; for there were
descriptions of winter nights on the bog-land, and winter
mornings on the hill, and wild adventures along the shore

in snow time or in the hard black frost. Even to Fitz.
gerald himself—who was pleased to see how interested his
companion was in these reminiscences—it seemed that they
were more picturesque now and here in London than when
he had to get up shivering in the dark morning, and dress
by candle-light, and sally forth through the silent street of
Inisheen. He forgot the wet clothes in describing the
view from the mountain-side outlooking to the sea. He
forgot the mortification of misses in the glory of lucky finds.
These days of sport that are lived over again in memory
generally end with a heavy bag; and however tired and
cold and wet and hungry the sportsman may have been in
reality, he forgets all that, and remembers only the delight
with which that heavy bag is thrown down in the hall, and
the warm snug evening afterwards, when the dinner-things
are removed, and chairs drawn to the fire, and the friendly
tobacco begins to throw a charm over the soul.
Only once did Fitzgerald, who, it must be confessed, had
enjoyed talking over these things, try to start his companion
off again about painting. “Are you a sea painter ?” he
said. “Do you paint sea-pieces as well ?”—and then he
glanced again at the dusty gray canvases.
"I?” said Ross. “No, I should think not! Why it
would break my heart. Other things are difficult enough;
but that! Man, I see pictures of the sea at the Academy
that just make one laugh. Every wave as accurately shaped
and modelled as if it was cast out of melted cannon; every
little turn of foam, as clean cut as a meerschaum pipe.
God, the fellows must be cleverer than Joshua the son of
Nun, for they must have got the sea as well as the sun and
clouds to stand still. Did ever man's eyes see moving
water like that? Moving water that is a constant distraction
of lights and shifting shadows and forms—lightning touches
you might say, so swift are they—all bewildering and
glancing round ye; and that is what ye begin to cut and
carve and stick on canvas as if it were slices of cream-
cheese on the top o' green sealing-wax. No, no; it's bad
enough inland. Even when ye get perfectly still shadows on
a perfectly still loch, there's an oily kind of glisten that no
pent-box is likely to get for ye. Eh, and such chances as
God, the they must ibi. Did

we had sometimes at the wild-fowl when we were camping
out—that would have made your mouth water; ay, and at
black game too. Nearly every morning when we went out
to wash in the burn-that was when we had the caravan
in Perthshire—I've seen them walking about without the
least fear o' us. Maybe the old black cock would give a
cluck-cluck of warning, but the hen and her brood scarcely
heeded. Deed I once hit an old gray hen with a pent
brush, as sure as death. And when, at last, the keeper
lent me a gun and said I might shoot a bird once in a
while-for our own cooking, ye ken, out I went as early as
six o'clock— " So again they were back on the various
adventures and experiences of shooting; recalling vivid
rambles in other years, now in Inverness-shire, now on the
desolate bog-lands near to Inisheen. And so interesting
was this talk, that when Fitzgerald definitely rose to depart,
at the hour of half-past four in the morning, he had almost
forgotten that he had not seen his host's pictures.
“Pictures,” said John Ross, with a laugh, “toots no,
man, ye can see pictures any day, and better than mine.
But I would like ye to come in whenever ye have half an
hour, and smoke a pipe and let us know how ye are
getting on."
“All right, I shall be delighted,” said Fitzgerald, most
heartily. “And I may learn something to-morrow—that is
to say, if my nose has not become twice its natural size, in
which case I shall keep indoors."

CHAPTER V.
THE BEGINNING OF A CAREER.
HOWEVER, there was no trace of the blow discoverable next
day, and so on this fine May morning Fitzgerald set about
the accomplishment of his various tasks. First of all he had
to accompany his artist friend to the police station ; though
indeed he harboured no sentiment of revenge against the
luckless Cobbler who had once more fallen into the clutches
of the law. Then he proceeded to get the thirty pounds
made transferable to Ireland. This, nevertheless, he did
with some compunction. For, if he was to fight his way in
London, was it fair to Kitty, who had entrusted her future
to him, that he should thus throw away the sinews of war?
Was it not running a tremendous risk to leave himself with
only seven pounds before securing some definite work?
But then on the other hand he had fair prospects before
him ; and he had the courage of two or three and twenty;
besides, he was not going to allow that blackguard Maloney
to triumph over his father, Coursing Club or no Coursing
Club. And so he went and sent off the money, and then
made his way to the Albany, where he had an appointment
with Mr. Hilton Clarke. When Fiammetta showed him
into the richly-coloured room, he found that gentleman
reclining in a low easy-chair, in a voluminous dressing gown,
a cigarette in one hand, a paper-covered novel in the other,
while before him on the little table were the remains of a
French breakfast.
“How are you, Fitzgerald ?” he said, throwing aside the
book. “Sit down and have some coffee and a cigarette.
E

No? You'll find that Chartreuse worth trying. Well, and
what did you think of the great Gifford? Was the godlike
man up to your expectations ?”.
“I was very much interested,” said Fitzgerald, rather
timidly, for indeed he did not like the way in which Mr.
Hilton Clarke spoke of the literary calling and of its professors,
whilst he did not wish to show the presumption of putting
himself into antagonism with one who was so much his
superior. “I have always had a great regard for the Liberal
Review, and—of course, I never thought I should ever meet
the Editor. I haven't seen you to thank you for giving me
such a chance—perhaps you don't quite understand what it
is to a young fellow who has only heard of well-known men.
I-I thought it was a great honour.”
“Oh, you will soon get rid of all that modesty," said the
other. “It is a useless article in London."
“We walked home together," continued Fitzgerald, "as
far as Sloane Street, and Mr. Gifford was good enough to
say I might try my hand at a notice of that new novel
· Daphne's Shadow' for the Liberal Review."
“The devil he did! What can have made him so good-
natured ?"
“I think I know," put in Fitzgerald, dexterously. “His
good nature was caused by your good nature in recommend-
ing me."
“Oh, that was nothing," said the other, .carelessly.
“ Well, you must be cautious how you set about it. Bring
the book to me.”
“But I have already sent in the review."
“Already? You haven't been wasting time, then.”
“And I have been doing more than that,” said Fitzgerald,
pulling out a certain envelope. “I have been putting
together a few salmon flies for you, if you care to have them.
I found I could get the materials better in London.”
“Ah, thanks, much obliged,” said Hilton Clarke, taking
out one or two of the flies with his beautiful white fingers.
“ But about this review. I am afraid the gray-eyed Athene
wasn't looking after you when you sent it in in such a hurry.
I wish you had come to me first. Young reviewers don't
seem to understand that they ought to consider for whom

they are writing when they write. It isn't the public; the
public judge for themselves nowadays ; dinner-tables and
clubs do all that. Nor the author; the author is pig-
headed; besides if you don't tell him he is better than
Byron or Shakespere he will think you are devoured with
jealousy and spite. No," continued Hilton Clarke, as he
carefully rolled up another. cigarette. “You are writing
for your editor. He is the audience you ought to consider.
He is the person you must impress with a conviction of
your sagacity. Now, to do that, you see, you want experi-
ence, you want to know your man. I wish you had come
to me. I suppose it never occurred to you to put John
Brown into the review you wrote for Gifford ?”
“ John Brown?” said Fitzgerald, looking bewildered.
“ What John Brown ?"
"John Brown of Harper's Ferry. No, you never thought
of that. But if you had only come to me, I could have
told you that you had only to put John Brown into the
review, anywhere, anyhow, and you'd have fetched old
Gifford to a dead certainty. He can't withstand John
Brown. All you've got to do," he continued, contemplating
one of the salmon flies and stroking out the soft feathers,
" is to take John Brown's body, without any wings, or
· hackle, or tinsel, as one might say, and you drop that fly
quietly over Gifford's nose, and he'll rise to it like a grilse
just fresh run from the sea."
Fitzgerald could not understand why this friend of his
lost no opportunity of throwing taunts—however they
might be veiled in a sort of scornful fastidiousness—at
Mr. Gifford ; but for the constraint with which he listened
to such speeches there were also other reasons. Among
the various articles of young Fitzgerald's creed (he was
barely three and twenty) there were none he clung to more
implicitly than these two. First, that the great majority of
womankind were honest and honourable, self-denying,
believable, and worthy of all the beautiful things that had
been said about them by the poets; and, secondly, that
literature was one of the noblest callings on the face of the
earth, and that he who did good work therein, whether it
was in definitely adding to the world's possessions in that

SHANDON BELLS
way, or whether it was merely in teaching men, from week
to week, or from day to day, what they ought to value, was
a public benefactor who ought to be regarded with respect
and affection and gratitude. Now on both these points
Mr. Hilton Clarke discoursed with a complacently open
scepticism ; and at such times Fitzgerald wished he could
close his ears against this talk; not that it in the slightest
degree affected his beliefs, but that it affected what he
wished to regard as the character of his friend. Fitzgerald
was naturally a hero-worshipper, and he was capable of a
warm gratitude. He wished to think the best of his friend.
And when Hilton Clarke talked in this fashion, which he
seemed to enjoy in proportion as Fitzgerald's face fell, the
latter would try to close his ears as much as he could.
Then again when he left he would endeavour to forget all
that he had heard. He would remember only Hilton
Clai ke's best points—the charm of his conversation when
he happened to light on some literary point that interested
him ; his great kindness shown to a mere stranger met by
chance in the south of Ireland; and his personal courtesy
(the way in which he had come to the relief of his incor-
rectly attired guest was still fresh in Fitzgerald's mind).
Besides, perhaps his experience of women had been
unfortunate; and perhaps his disparagement of contem-
porary literature, especially of critical literature, was due to
a sort of modesty, seeing that he himself held an enviable
position in it.
“Well now, Fitzgerald, let's get on to this magazine
business. Won't you smoke ?"
"No, thank you, I never smoke till night; it takes up
too much time.”
“Ah, the eager impetuosity of youth. When you get a
dozen years older, you'll be glad of something to help you
to pass the hours. Well, my friend the capitalist has got
some impetuoşity too. In one day he has managed to secure
a business manager for us, and also a publishing-office in the
Strand. No doubt we should start as soon as possible ;
for in a short time every one will be in London for the
season, and then it is that people begin to talk about their
plans for the autumn. Scobell suggests the week after

next; but that is clearly impossible. We must have
material to begin with; people won't pay a shilling for a
mere programme of our intentions. My private impres-
sion is that the capitalist imagines he will find himself
a person of importance in society through his connection
with this magazine; but it will be part of your business,
Mr. Sub-Editor, to remember that it is I who am editor of
the magazine, and not Dick Scobell.”
“Oh, of course. I know what rows with proprietors
are,” said Fitzgerald.
“Proprietors are the most unreasonable of mortals.
They don't understand their proper sphere of duty,—which
is to pay and look pleasant. If the venture succeeds, they
get good interest for their money. If it doesn't, they don't
mend matters by coming in at intervals, like a Greek
chorus : 'Oh! oh! oh! Woe! woe! woe!' Now, as
regards your own position, Fitzgerald,” he said, as he
poured out a small glass of Chartreuse--showing as he did
so a singular-looking ring on his finger, consisting of a little
Indian god, in gold, fastened on a broad silver hoop.
“ Have you considered the question of remuneration ?”
“ As regards myself?”
- Yes."
“Not in the least," said Fitzgerald, with something of a
blush. “I don't expect very much at the outset. I think
I am very lucky to get a start so early after coming to
London. There is an artist neighbour of mine who thinks
I have been very lucky indeed, and he considers everything
a matter of luck, even getting elected a member of the
Academy."
“He must have been looking at this year's exhibition,"
said Hilton Clarke, drily. “Well, now, this capitalist frienc!
gives me a lump sum, I may explain to you, and he holds
me responsible for all the literary matter, and for having
the thing properly put together. What you will have to do
won't interfere, I hope and think, with any more serious
literary work. Very well, what do you think of four
pounds a week? Speak frankly, you know, for I may
squeeze the good Scobell a little further yet.”
"Four pounds a week?” said Fitzgerald, with his face

brightening up with surprise. “Then my artist friend was
right. I had five-and-twenty shillings a week from the
Cork Chronicle."
“ It is enough, then ?”
“Yes, indeed. It is far more than I expected."
“ You should never say that. It is not wise. How-
ever, as I am dealing with another man's money, I am not
going to reduce the offer; and I think myself it is a fair
one. And so you had five-and-twenty shillings a week on
the Cork Chronicle ?” said Hilton Clarke, regarding the
younger man. “Twenty-five shillings a week ; youth, and
health, and high ambition ; and somebody to write love
verses about : I suppose you were not unhappy? Oh yes,
I could detect that subtle inspiration here and there, in
whatever guise the young lady turned up. But I have
always had a suspicion that when youthful poets gave their
sweethearts long and sounding names, the ladies themselves
were rather short of stature. Is not that so? It is like
calling a musical little verse in Horace a choriambic dimeter
acatalectic. The Lady Irmingarde, for example. That is
a fine name; but I would wager now that the Lady
Irmingarde is not over five feet two."
“I don't see what that has to do with this new maga-
zine,” said Master Willie, striving to be very calm, but with
all the quick blood of the Fitzgeralds blazing in his face.
“Don't be angry, man,” said the other good-naturedly.
“I hope it will have a great deal to do with the new
magazine. You see, in every well-conducted household
you will find two or three people either in love with some-
body or other, or else willing to think of the days when
they were ; and you can't appeal to that sentiment unless
you, the writer, have yourself a fresh fount of inspiration to
draw from. You don't suppose that the old writers, when
they were describing Helen, formed her out of their own
head? Of course not. Of course they turned to the
pretty Chloe or the laughing Lalage of their acquaintance,
to see what soft cheeks and pretty eyes could be likened
to. Do you remember Symmons's translation of that
passage in the Agamemnon—well, it is rather a paraphrase
than a translation ; but listen to this as a piece of English :-

When first she came to Ilion's towers
Oh, what a glorious sight, I ween, was there !
The tranquil beauty of the gorgeous queen
Hung soft as breathless summer on her cheeks,
Where, on the damask sweet, the glowing zephyr slept;
And like an idol beaming from its shrine,
So o'er the floating gold around her thrown
Her peerless face did shine ;
And though sweet softness hung upon their lids,
Yet her young eyes still wounded where they looked.'
Is not that fine ?
• Yet her young eyes still wounded where they looked.""
And indeed Fitzgerald considered it was so fine-and
so nearly suggestive of a pair of soft black innocent young
eyes that he knew of far away, that he straightway forgot
all his wrath, and proposed to his companion that, if he
had time, they should walk down to the Strand, and have
a look at the offices.
“I can't very well," said Hilton Clarke, yawning and
stretching out his long legs, and stroking his yellow beard.
“I have got to dress first. Then I am going on to Jermyn
Street to the Turkish Baths. Then I've got one or two calls
to make in the afternoon. But you might go down if you
like, and introduce yourself to the manager. His name is
Silas Earp. And don't forget we must have a touch of
sentiment in the magazine ; it is wonderful the interest
that grown people take in young people's love affairs.
Look at the eagerness with which they read Breach of
Promise cases—the more absurd the better, don't you see;
for they are delighted to find other people making just such
fools of themselves as they did at the same age."
Well, Fitzgerald got away ; and was rather glad; for
somehow he liked Hilton Clarke better, and was more
grateful to him, when he was not listening to him. And
now indeed the day was joyful to him—a fresh, clear, May
day, with the pavements of Piccadilly looking quite white;
and all he could think of was that Kitty would not know
soon enough of the good fortune that had befallen him.
After all, why should he have been angry about the mention

of the Lady Irmingarde ?--it was only good-humoured
banter. For indeed, as Andy the Hopper had remarked,
“'twas Masther Willie had the duck's back;" and annoyances
ran clean off his shoulders, so long as you gave him plenty
of fresh air and sunlight, and a moderate share of pavement
for his eager and rapid walking.
He went down to the Strand and saw the offices, which
were in a sad state of confusion and dust. Likewise he
had a long conversation with Mr. Earp, and a briefer one
with the great capitalist himself, who seemed surprised that
Hilton Clarke had not shown up, though Fitzgerald ventured
to point out that an editor could not be of much use about
the place until they had provided him with at least a desk
and a penny bottle of ink. Then with one hurried and
passing glance at the office of the Liberal Review—where,
perhaps, that first contribution of his was at this very
moment under consideration—he set off home as fast as
his legs could carry him, anxious to fill up the rest of the
day with some work, and also in the secret hope of finding
a letter from Kitty, missed by his early outgoing of that
morning, awaiting him. Moreover, he was very hungry,
after these many hours; and so, on reaching his spacious
if somewhat bare and low-roofed study, he besought his
landlady to cook him a chop with all convenient speed.
And indeed that was a right royal banquet that he enjoyed
there, all by himself, in the silent, big room, made cheerful
by the sunlight streaming in at the open window; for if it
consisted only of a chop, some bread, and a glass of ale,
was there not a letter of Kitty's, over a dozen pages long,
to serve as a musical and laughing accompaniment? The
sun shone warm on the faded rugs on the floor; there was
the faintest stirring of the wind among the young plane-
trees in the courtyard outside; in the silence it almost
seemed as if he could hear Kitty talking to him. And then
again he had to imagine another picture—that lofty little
terrace that looked down on Cork and over to Shandon
steeple ; and a small room there ; and Kitty bending over
these precious leaves, and sometimes raising her head, to
look at the rain or to think of him far away.

“Audley Place, Tuesday.

“What I have done to deserve it I don't know, but
since ever I came back to this blessed town there has been
nothing but rain, rain, and rain, and the Beautiful City,
that you tried to make me believe was like Venice, is
nothing but a mass of smoke away down in a hole, and St.
Mary's steeple over there seems to shiver with cold when it
strikes the half-hours, and the only human beings within
sight are a lot of rooks in the meadows across the road, and
you can tell by the noise they make they are in a frightful
temper because of the wet. I do wonder now more than
ever where, in such a climate, a certain person got all the
sunniness that's in his face, and in his eyes, and more
particularly his hair. Did he take all there was to get and
leave none ? At all events, Master Coulin, it's a very good
thing for you, and it's a very bad thing for me, that you
and I did not live in the time when the cold-hearted Saxon
made the young Irishmen crop their locks, for then I
wouldn't have looked at you, and I'd have minded my own
proper business. Dear me, the audacity of some people
and the folly of others ! Just when a good contralto is
worth a mint of money in Italian opera, jealousy steps in
and says, No, you sha'n't ; you sha'n't even be allowed to
sing in England; no more Crystal Palace for you ; nothing
but concerts in such centres of civilisation as Cork and
Limerick and Belfast; and just to make sure of hiding
away such a diamond-no, I suppose it should be an
emerald in Ireland I'll set Don Fierna and his wicked
elves to bind you in invisible chains, and something awful
will happen to you if you even whisper La Scala in your
dreams. Well, whether it was her tremendous good-nature,
or whether it was the sunlight that had got into the brown
of Mr. Jealousy's hair, or whether she got such a fright
with the ghosts thạt she promised anything without the
slightest notion of keeping her word, I don't know, but the
thing was done; and then all of a sudden-in return for
her extraordinary good-nature and self-sacrifice, she finds

down the sand of Inisheen, which, as Andy the Hopper
remarks, is so firm and clean that, 'sure, Miss, ye might
walk on it wid a satin shoe.'
"Oh, Willie, I'm sick tired of the rain, and I don't
know what I'm writing to you. I was wet through last
night coming home. What induced me to take these
rooms I don't know. I shall never again take lodgings
where one cannot drive home on a wet night. But Miss
Patience says she likes large views; I suppose they conform
with her great mind. I have been so good, Willie. I
have been really so very good that I don't know what to
do with myself; and I expect to find wings sprouting some
morning when I get up. I haven't gone round by the
barracks once; and the two or three times I have gone
round I have kept my eyes fixed on the gravel the whole
way, just in case a young ossifer might come riding out (I
can see the frown on your face quite clearly, and perhaps
it isn't safe to put jokes in a letter, when one isn't by to
be scolded for impertinence, flippancy, unlady-like manners,
and all the pleasant rest of it). So we'll get back to
business, please, and the truth is, you know, Master Willie,
although it has been reserved for an English singer to
reveal to the Irish people the pathos of "The Bells of
Shandon,' all the same the English singer can't earn a
living by singing that one song, -unless indeed she were
to sing it through the streets, like Nellie in the Green
Bushes. No, nor even when she makes a skilful selection
illustrating the wonderful virtues of the Irish people, and
when she shifts her engagements as much as possible from
north to south, and east to west; yes, and even when she
makes excuses for pretty long holidays—at Inisheen or else-
where; even the Irish people, though liking to be told of their
virtues, may get a little tired of her, and wish to see a little
less of her. In that case managers might begin to hint
about reduction of terms; whereas, even at present, it's
just about all she can do to keep things straight-waiting
for the glorious time when Prince Golden-hair is coming to
claim her and carry her off. Very well, now, this is the
point; at the Theatre in Dublin they're going to put in a

somewhat the voiceo play ve distressed here mischithe Black
panorama between the pieces, and they've made me an
offer ; (now you needn't jump out of your chair like that ;
it isn't to go on the stage) I say they have made me a very
fair and liberal offer if I will go and sing for them—only
one song each evening, which is light work, and I shall
have no expense of dresses or gloves, for I sing in the
'wings' unseen. Don't you see the panorama is really a
series of pictures of Irish scenery, and when they come to
the finest of them—of course it's Killarney in moonlight,
that's because they don't know the glen near the Black-
water where Don Fierna lives and where mischief is done
to the hearts of poor distressed damsels, — then the
orchestra begins to play very softly and sweetly, and then
you hear the voice of an angel (that's me) singing away
somewhere-at Innisfallen or Killeenalougha. I don't
think much of the song they have sent me; but I daresay
it will sound very nice in that mysterious way, and the
moonlight and the view of the lake will put a charm into
my poor singing. Now, Willie, I know you don't want me
to go to Dublin; but this isn't like going to Dublin in an
ordinary kind of way, for my name won't appear in the
bills at all, and nobody will know who is singing. It will
really be a long holiday for me, and I shall come back to
my concert series after a sufficiently long absence, and I
promise you that as I shall have no audience visible, I will
sing every evening just as if I were singing to you; and
think of you all the time, and the management will not
have reason to be sorry for that. Now what do you say ?
My father's half-pay just about keeps him, you know; but
I have always tried to send him some little present about
midsummer to induce him to go down to Ramsgate or
Margate for a week. Then these long holidays, even with
all the good old Patience's economy, have very nearly
emptied my purse, and supposing that Prince Golden-hair
were suddenly to appear and say, 'Look sharp, Miss Kitty,
I've found the bag of diamonds I went for. Come along !'
wouldn't it be very awkward if I had to say, 'Oh, but, dear
sir, I haven't got a farthing to buy my white satin dress
with '? So be a good boy and don't make any objections,
and every night I'll think of you as I'm singing the song-

oh dear me, as if I had anything else to do now but think
of you ; with a bit of a cry now and again.
“What is the use of my writing to you? I know what
you are doing at this moment. You are not working at
all; you are not thinking of me at all; you are walking in
Hyde Park with Mr. Supercilious and admiring the fine
ladies, and I shouldn't wonder if he had got you to convict-
crop your hair, like his own, and wear gloves to get your
hands white. Why should I waste my time on you when
you're not thinking about me? Perhaps you won't open
this letter at all; perhaps you will leave it lying unopened
on the table, I shouldn't wonder a bit.
“I got Miss Patience to drive out on a car to the glen.
But it was common daylight, and Don Fierna and his
elves had gone away indoors; and there was nothing but
grumbling from the dear old Patience at her having to
scramble down the bank and scratch her hand with briers.
She couldn't imagine why I wanted to pull her to pieces
like that, nor could I get Andy the Hopper that same
afternoon to say a word about fairies or Don Fierna.
Indeed all the neighbourhood became quite commonplace.
Inisheen is a mean-looking miserable hole; I never saw
such dirty streets; and the wretched tubs of vessels are
lying not on sand at all, but on mud. I hated it—except
one or two nights when the moon was up, and I looked
out on the cliffs beyond the bar, and I said to myself,
'Well now, if my bonny boy were coming home from these
cliffs carrying with him the wild pigeons he had been after
all the day, perhaps I'd like the place a little better,' and
then, you know, how could I help thinking of the night
you rowed me home in the boat, and all Inisheen asleep,
and you had wrapped me up so tight in the shawl? I
waved my handkerchief to you from the window, but I
daren't lift the window, so you couldn't see. I watched
you go away back to the town—the boat the wee-est black
speck on the silver of the water. Dear me! that I should
say anything against Inisheen, that is the dearest spot in
the world to me, and hallowed by associations that memory
will never give up. My dear, dear Inisheen! My beau-

night seven years hence? Perhaps I shall not be so fright-
ened then.
“But what I dread most of all, Willie, is next Sunday
morning. I know it will be a beautiful morning just to
spite me. And I know how I shall wait about the window
with all my things on long before the time, and looking
over to the clock of St. Anne's and wishing it would push
ahead and make the single Shandon bell strike the half-
hour. (Why did you quarrel with Miss Patience, Willie ?
it was so nice to listen for your ring at the door.) And
then half-past ten strikes and out I go; and I am certain
it will be the loveliest morning, and the hawthorn just
coming out, and all the fresh air sweet-scented. And no
one at the corner—the place quite empty—no trace of the
gamekeeperish young Apollo, with the shy eyes and the
sun-brown locks, who used to say “The top of the morning
to ye, Miss Kitty !' and be so modest and grateful for her
condescension. Then away she goes all alone past the
barracks—but really, really and truly, honour bright, keep-
ing her eyes on the ground the whole way until she has
passed the walls—and then do you know of a lane about
there, Master Willie ? Do you know of a lane about there
that you can go along and twist and turn about, until you
get out among hedgerows, where grown-up children can
pull wild flowers and say pretty things to each other? Did
you ever go along such a lane ?
“But you are not listening. You are out walking with
Mr. Superciliousness, and if there's anybody in the wide
world who hates you with her whole heart, it's your despised
but forgiving
KITTY."
He looked at the beginning of the letter again.
“I'm glad it rained on Tuesday," he said to himself;
and he thought that his conscience would perhaps absolve
him if he put off his work for a little while, to send Kitty just
as long a letter as she had sent him-cheating the great
distance between them, as it were, and imagining himself
talking to her in the little room looking over the valley to
Shandon tower.

CHAPTER VI.
A FIRST CHECK.
TIME passed and Fitzgerald grew very anxious about not
hearing anything, good, bad, or indifferent, concerning the
review. he had sent to Mr. Gifford. He ventured to
mention the matter to Hilton Clarke.
“Get it back," he said, laughing, "and put John Brown
into it.”
However, if each morning brought its little pang of
disappointment, there was no time for balancing hope and
fear during the rest of the day; for now the new magazine
was being pushed forward, and everybody had his hands
full. Everybody, that is to say, except the editor-in-chief,
who, when Fitzgerald called on him and urged him to
come down to the Strand to decide some matter or other,
seemed much more inclined for a lounge along Piccadilly,
if the morning was fine, accompanied by this attentive
Telemachus, who willingly listened to his discursive mono-
logue. By this time Fitzgerald had got to know something
more about Hilton Clarke, and had observed among other
things that he seemed quite incapable of denying himself
any gratification that lay within his reach. No matter
what it was—having his initials in silver on his ivory-backed
hair-brushes, or the purchase of an illuminated missal
displayed in a shop window; the whim of the moment had
to be gratified, and he was careful to point out to Fitzgerald
that he, Hilton Clarke, had already done a good deal for
Mr. Scobell in presenting him with the idea of this new
magazine, and also to assign as a reason for his carelessness

63
or his idleness the necessity of the business people having
all their arrangements completed first.
One morning Fitzgerald went up to the Albany and
found his chief with the accustomed cigarette in his hand
reading the Contes Rémois—or, more probably, and profit-
ably, looking over the delightful little woodcuts. He put
the book aside as Fitzgerald entered.
“Mr. Scobell has made a suggestion that I think very
good,” said the latter, after the usual greetings. “He
thinks you should have for your opening article a paper
written by a lawyer, some well-known Q.C., for example,
on the terms of leases and agreements, and the points that
should be carefully looked after. “Points on which a
solicitor should be consulted,' he suggests. You know, lots
of people enter into agreements about a shooting or a
house, that look all right and safe, but that may land them
anywhere. Now just at the outset wouldn't that be rather
appropriate ?"
Hilton Clarke looked at him.
“The suggestion is Scobell's ?”.
“ Yes."
"Well, you see, I don't think it is a bad one; but at
the outset it is most important for me, and for you, and for
Dick Scobell, to know precisely where we are. Now I am.
the editor of this new magazine, and Mr. Scobell is not."
“Yes," said Fitzgerald, wondering ; “but surely you
may take suggestions from anybody if they happen to be
worth anything?"
“From anybody-except my proprietor, you under-
stand. No, we will get our own idea for an opening
article, Fitzgerald. Let's talk about something you are
more familiar with. And I have some news for you. One
of the most charming women in London, one of the wittiest
and one of the best looking too, has expressed an interest
in you."
“Oh, indeed,” said Fitzgerald, professing to be very
grateful, as in duty bound.
“I showed her your "Woodland Walk,' and she com-
missioned me to ask you whether the verses were your
own-


## p. 64 (#76) ##############################################

SHANDON BELLS
“Which verses ?” said Fitzgerald, for indeed there were
several little bits of rhyme cunningly interwoven with that
gossip about birds and waterfalls.
"Why, those with the refrain, "The little ringlets round
her ears.' Ah, I can see they were your own. I thought
so myself. , And I was to ask whether the little ringlets
were dark or golden-golden, she guessed.” .
Fitzgerald flushed and said with an indifferent air-
“I suppose the lines can apply to any colour-pink as
well as another.”
“You won't tell us, then? Well, it was a pretty notion
to bring the refrain in at the end of each verse. The
music of it catches you. If I were writing an opera I
should have one particular air running all through it;
cropping up here and there, you know, so that people
should get quite familiar with it, and be able to whistle it
as they go home. You have no idea how consoling it is to
some people to whistle an air from a new opera as they are
coming out. That is a pretty refrain you have in your
verses.
•You hear the secret words she hears,
You little ringlets round her ears !'
Yes, I like it. The repetition is effective."
“I have been to the lithographer's,” said Fitzgerald,
shortly. “The cover looks very well; but I have told
him to try red on a white ground. That would be clearly
seen on the bookstalls."
“Ah, yes, no doubt. Earp will see to that, I suppose.
Now, Fitzgerald, I suppose you know very little about
women as yet?
“I suppose not,” said the other.
“I know one thing that will surprise you when you find
it out, as I daresay you will.” He stretched out his legs,
and regarded the tips of his fingers—a favourite attitude
of his when he had got something he liked to talk about.
But sometimes he regarded his companion. “I am quite
convinced myself that there are a large number of women
who know nothing about, who are incapable of knowing
anything about, the romantic sentiment of love. They
and regarded theay you will." Hurprise you whe

have never experienced it; they will never experience it;
and when they read about it in books they don't believe in
it; they think it is only the ridiculous exaggerations of a
poet or a playwright. They no more believe what they
read about the passion of love than a man with an
unmusical ear believes what people say about Mozart, or
than a man whose eye is uneducated believes what is
written about Titian. But, mind you, these are the women
it is safest to make a marriage contract with. They will
honourably fulfil their part of it; make good wives and
mothers; and be affectionate enough in a trustworthy,
patient, unimaginative sort of way, without causing any
anxiety or bother. Well, now, I believe there are other
women who are just as much the other way—who have an
absolute hunger and thirst for the sentiment of love, for its
dram-drinking, as you might say—women of an unappeas-
able heart. If it is your bad luck to come across one of
these at the moment when her affections are by some
extraordinary chance disengaged—she will almost certainly
make you fall in love with her; and then, mind you, so
long as you are near her, and keep her amused and
occupied with fallings out and reconciliations and so forth,
I daresay she will remain quite faithful to you. Oh yes, I
have no doubt of that. But if you go away, that is
dangerous. Her eyes will begin to roam about, and her
heart to put out trembling little feelers. Of course if you
were to marry her off hand that might settle it; and
certainly if she had children she would probably keep all
right, for she would transfer her excess of affection to them.
But to be left alone-to have this warm generous little
heart of hers wanting to be kind to somebody—and her
young eyes still wounding where they look — poor thing,
how can she help going and playing the mischief ?"
“Perhaps your experience of women has been unfor-
tunate,” said Fitzgerald, as respectfully as possible. It was
quite clear to him that Hilton Clarke had, perhaps in
conjunction with the clever lady he had referred to, been
speculating about the person who had inspired the verses
in the “Woodland Walk” – that is to say, Kitty; and
Fitzgerald resented this harmless curiosity as a piece of

SHANDON BELLS
intolerable impertinence. They wanted to know whether
her hair was dark or golden ;, they had been wondering
whether she was a placid, faithful, unsentimental good sort
of stupid creature, or a dangerous flirt-either suggestion
seeming to him monstrous; and generally, as it appeared
to him, they had been betraying a quite gratuitous interest
in his private affairs. But Hilton Clarke continued as
if he were quite unaware of the resentment that these
generalisations of his had provoked.
“No,” he said quietly, “I think not. And I would call
it observation rather than experience. I suppose now you
have never noticed that a woman's eyes are always wander-
ing? You have never sate at a table-d'hôte, and watched,
for the fun of the thing, have you?"
“No, I should probably be attending to my dinner.”
“Ah, that is it. That is just it. If you look at the
married couples, the husbands are attending to their
dinners. It is the women whose eyes are constantly on
the alert. You may look at the man as long as you like,
and he won't know anything about it; but look at the
woman only for a second, and her eyes will meet yours-
of course instantly to turn away again. Indeed, I believe
that women can tell when they are being regarded, even
when their own eyes are bent upon the table. It is a kind
of instinct.”
“You seem to do a good deal of staring when you go
abroad,” remarked Fitzgerald.
“No; I think not. But I have tried the experiment a
few times. Oh, by the way, my charming friend says I
may take you to one of her smoking parties.”
“Smoking-parties? Are there ladies there ?"
“ Yes, of course.”
“And they smoke?”
"If they are inclined to. Some do; some don't. It
is Liberty Hall."
"And does the charming lady smoke ?" said Fitzgerald,
timidly. He wanted to know something about her, as she
had wanted to know something about Kitty.
"Well, occasionally. But she is quite as willing to sit
in a corner with you, and talk to you; and very soon you

will imagine you are listening to one of the laughing ladies
out of Boccaccio. But it is dangerous.'
“What is ?"
“Her trying to keep those parties away from Sir John's
ears. She'd much better own up. Some time or other
he'll come back from Ireland unexpectedly, and there will
be a row.”
“Sir John is her husband, I suppose ?”
“Yes. I've asked her to write an article on grass-widows
for our mağazine, and I'll have to see it doesn't set Clap-
ham in a blaze-Islington, rather. But we sha'n't have
many subscribers in Islington.”
“I think I must be off now,” said Fitzgerald, rising.
“ You think, then, Mr. Scobell had better not speak about
that article to a lawyer." .
“I think, with Mr. Scobell's permission, I will edit the
magazine myself. And so I am not to take any message
about the little ringlets round her ears ?".
“Oh, certainly. I told you," said Fitzgerald, “that
pink was a good colour. Let them be pink, if you like.”
“Wait a bit," said the other laughing. “You won't be
50 uncommunicative when a certain bright-eyed lady gets
you into a corner and talks to you; and asks to be allowed
to light her cigarette at yours; that is coming very near,
isn't it? Good-bye. Oh, about that review; if you are
anxious, why don't you call and ask Gifford about it?"
“I would,” said Fitzgerald, hesitatingly, “if I thought I
shouldn't be driving him.”
“Oh, bother him!” said Hilton Clarke, cheerfully.
“If he does not want it, we can use it in the magazine."
That parting touch took away much of Fitzgerald's
resentment. The man was evidently good-natured. And
even supposing he had been pushing his questions or his
surmises about Kitty a little too close, might it not have
been through a really friendly interest? Then, again, it
was something that so great and acknowledged an authority
as Hilton Clarke had looked favourably on the little verses.
Master Willie had placed no great store by them himself.
He had, indeed, hidden them away in a rambling sort of
gossip, imagining that no one but Kitty and himself would


## p. 68 (#80) ##############################################

SHANDON BELLS
know that he himself had written them. And as they had
pleased the great critic, he would write to Kitty and tell
her. Had she not a sort of joint ownership in them?
Fitzgerald had now to return to the Strand; and as he
was walking along that thoroughfare it suddenly occurred to
him that he would take Hilton Clarke's advice and call at
the Liberal Review office, and so put an end to his anxiety.
The advice was well meant; but it was injudicious; and
still more injudicious was Fitzgerald's choice of an oppor-
tunity. To go and worry an editor about a neglected
manuscript is a mistake at any time; but to do so before
luncheon is pure madness. When the morning scramble
of correspondence is well over ; when the frugal chop and
pint of claret have moderated the sava indignatio produced
by the contrariety of things; and when, perhaps, the mild
Manilla and the evening papers may be still further induc-
ing the editorial mind to repose, then indeed there may be
hope for the anxious inquirer ; but not before. Fitzgerald
had to wait some twenty minutes in the office; during
which time there was a constant passing up and down
stairs on the part of strangers, whom he regarded with con-
siderable awe. Then a boy brought him a message that
Mr. Gifford could see him, and he followed the inky-fingered
Mercury. In a minute or two he was standing very much
like a culprit in the front of a long writing-table; and Mr.
Gifford, who was on the other side, and who looked
impatient and troubled and hurried, was plunging to and
fro in a sea of manuscripts.
“Ah, here it is," he said at last. "Sit down. Glad
you have called. I meant to write. Well, you see—_"
He looked over a page or two, and an expression of
dissatisfaction was very plainly visible on his face. “Why,
you seem to have found nothing in the book, one way or
the other !”
If Fitzgerald had had his wits about him, he would
perhaps have remarked that that was precisely what he had
found in the book ; but he was far too disturbed and
aghast at the querulous fashion in which the Editor spoke
of the article upon which he had built so many hopes.
“No, I don't think this will do," continued Mr. Gifford,

A FIRST CHECK
looking over the pages. “I am sorry to have given you
the trouble ; but really you have made nothing out of the
book. Surely there must be something in it, good or bad;
you have found it nothing but what is lukewarm, like the
church of the Lacedemonians. There is no flavour in
what you have written. Look there !"
Fitzgerald was too agitated to think of putting the
Laodiceans in their proper historical place; he mechanically
took from Mr. Gifford a printed slip which the latter pulled
off a file. It turned out to be a proof of a bookseller's
advertisement; and at the head of the column appeared
the contents of the forthcoming number of a great Quarterly.
“Do you see?” continued Mr. Gifford. “That article
about 'A New Novelist ' has been called forth by this very
book that you see nothing in; and I am told they regard
its publication as marking a new departure in modern Eng.
lish literature."
" Then I say that that is most shameful,” said Fitzgerald,
driven to desperation. “There must have been bribery or
personal influence. The book is as weak and feeble as it
can be ; it is a scandal to English journalism that bribery
of some kind or another should have got such an article
written.”
“How can you tell ?” said the other peevishly. “In
your opinion the book is bad. Other people may not think
so. And even you don't seem to think the book bad
enough to call forth any definite disparagement.”
“ It is merely frivolous.”
“And you are even complimentary here and there. —
Well, then, perhaps you will excuse me if I point out some
things that may be of service to you. You know you ought
to be accurate in your quotations.
* De par le Roi, défense à Dieu,
D'opérer miracle en ce lieu.'
D'opérer instead of de faire miracle, and that in so familiar
a quotation- "
“But d'opérer is right,” said Fitzgerald, hastily inter-
rupting.
Gifford stopped and regarded him.

“Oh, is it? What is your authority? I should have
thought the old police distich was well enough known.”
Fitzgerald was so anxious to justify himself, that his
memory failed him altogether at this critical point. No-
thing but confusion met him when he tried to recall where
he had met with that luckless couplet. And so Mr. Gifford,
turning from him to the manuscript, proceeded :
“Then you introduce extraneous matter for no sufficient
reason. You say here, ‘One might arrive at a sort of
negative definition of poetry by saying that it was precisely
that quality which is conspicuously absent from every page
of Pope, and which is conspicuously present in almost every
line of Coleridge. Now what is the use of advancing an
opinion like that?"
“One of the characters in the book "
“Yes, yes," said Mr. Gifford, with an impatience that
was scarcely civil; though it was most likely he had been
worried about something or other that morning, “but a
reviewer cannot be expected to set all the opinions of all
the characters in a book right. And when you proceed to
remove Pope from the category of English poets, you want
more than a single sentence if you would justify yourself.
It is not enough for you to say that such and such a thing
is : you must prove it to be so. You can't go and settle
half a hundred disputed literary points in the course of a
single book notice- "
“I am sorry it won't do,” said Fitzgerald, lifting his hat.
“I may as well take the manuscript with me, if you don't
mind."
"I am sorry you have had the trouble ; but one must
learn reviewing as other things, and perhaps I made a
mistake in thinking you had had enough practice. There
are one or two other points I might show you."
. “Oh no, thank you; no, thank you,” said Fitzgerald,
with great courtesy, “I wouldn't trouble you. I must not
take up so much of your time. Good-morning. I am
very much obliged to you.”
And so he got himself out of the office with all his mind
aflame. It was not so much disappointment as indignation
that consumed him ; indignation that such a book should

be nade so great a matter of, simply because it was written
by a member of the government, by a man known in poli-
tical life. What was the objection, then, to this review
but that he had not made it violent enough either with
praise or blame? If he had made of it a balloon, now,
and tied the worthless volumes to it and sent them up into
the blue; or if he had made a nether millstone of it and
hung it round Spencer Tollemache's neck, and plunged
him in mid-ocean, no doubt the black-browed Editor would
have been charmed. But because he had merely told the -
truth, the review was lukewarm like the Lacedemonians.
The Lacedemonians! And de faire miracle !-he knew it
was d'opérer miracle! As for Pope, he declared to himself
that the whole “Essay on Man," boiled down and strained
through a cotton rag, would not produce as much poetry as
you could find in a single phrase of Herrick's or Suckling's.
And then he devoted the whole art and function of criticism
to the infernal gods; and then-in the middle of the Strand,
among the hurrying strangers—he laughed lightly.
For it suddenly occurred to him that to betray such
temper, or to feel so keenly his disappointment, was not
bearing out the character that Andy, the Hopper had given
of him to Kitty. Was he going to allow this first bit of
misfortune to cast him down ? He began to regard the
matter from a common-sense point of view. After all, his
being debarred from further hope of contributing to the
Liberal Review (and he had to admit that Mr. Gifford's
manner seemed conclusive on that point) did not neces-
sarily doom him to starvation. And why should he be
angry with the great Quarterly, even if it had been unduly
influenced ?—the public would speedily put the matter right
by leaving the book, if it was worthless, unread. When he
came to think of it, moreover, there might be some justi-
fication for Mr. Gifford's harsh censure, regarding the
article from the editorial point of view. Doubtless he
ought to have left Pope alone. He should not have altered
a familiar quotation without being ready with his authority.
In fact, by the time that he had reached Charing Cross, he had
convinced himself that the world was not so much amiss ;
and this gradual revival from his fit of disappointment did

not at all stop there; but quite suddenly—and in a manner
that seemed to fill all the dusky sunlight of the Strand
with a sort of rose-colour-it sprang to a wild resolve.
What if he were to go away back to Ireland, and spend a
day among the hawthorn lanes with Kitty ?
He could not resist. The rebound from that extreme
of having to buy a Bradshaw and get some information out
of that distressing volume succeeded in calming down this
bewildering delight and anticipation that had seized hold of
him. Yes, by taking the mail train to Bristol that night,
which was a Friday, he could reach Cork on the Saturday
evening; and then the Sunday morning—and his meeting
Kitty—and clasping her warm white little hand! The
whole trip would cost little over two pounds: was it not
his only chance before the long drudgery of the new
magazine began? A hundred times over he pictured to
himself Kitty's face when she should suddenly see him
there waiting for her, and each time the expression was
different. And as for reviews, and quotations, and black-
browed editors, and any fifteen dozen of Daphne's Shadows,
he let all these things slip entirely away from him, to be
lost in the jangle and roar of the mighty town he was leaving.
He was not thinking of them at all. He was thinking of
Sunday morning and of Kitty's tender look of wonder and
welcome.
It was about a quarter past eight in the evening when
he reached Cork; and they were just beginning to light the
lamps. There was still a lurid sort of twilight in the stormy
purple-blue sky, and the pavements were of a pale gray ;
but one after another the orange points of the lamps
declared themselves, and here and there a yellow glow
shone out from the shop windows. The omnibus rattled
through the town; past the black groups of idlers; now
and again a woman darting out with an angry objurgation
to snatch in a vagrant child. He had been looking forward
to his passing through the familiar streets as a sort of dream.
Now it seemed strangely real. That sense of being at
home that he had never experienced in the vast wilderness
of London had possession of him again ; the accent of the

people had a pleasant, almost pathetic touch in it; he
seemed to know them so well, to have got back among old
friends.
But he was not going to seek to see Miss Romayne that
night, wildly as his heart beat when he thought of her being
so near him—just over there in the darkness—little think-
ing of what was in store for her. No; he would wait for
the morning; he would have nothing less than the fresh
and clear May morning to show him the sudden, glad love-
light leap into Kitty's wondering eyes.

CHAPTER VII.
WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG."
MASTER WILLIE was up and abroad early the next morning
—too early, indeed, for anything but a stroll through the
wide, empty, silent thoroughfares of Cork. It was a lovely
morning; the sunlight shining clear on the tall fronts of
the houses, and on the deserted streets; a light breeze
from the south bringing with it suggestions of the sea; the
silence only broken by the occasional soft tolling of a distant
the place seem so strange ?—for surely he had not been
long enough in London to have forgotten these familiar
streets. Or was the keen interest and even affection with
which he regarded so well-known a thoroughfare as the
South Mall, for example, due to far other causes ? Suppose
that as he walked along he did not see this actual sunlight
around him at all; suppose that instead he was imagining
these pavements swimming wet on a dark and miserable
week-day night; the cars rattling by and splashing mud;
and two figures, closely holding together, arm-in-arm, under
one umbrella ? And suppose now that he sees one of these
two look suddenly up to her companion with a quick,
earnest gaze-a look of revelation, confession, complete
surrender of love-a look that pledged her life away? For
even the South Mall, in its canopy of darkness and rain,
may enclose the rose-red, shining jewel of a love-secret.
So he walked hither and thither to pass the time away,
half dreaming of these recent days that already seemed to
be growing distant, until he found himself in the broad and

“WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG” 75
winding thoroughfare of St. Patrick's Street, where more
passers-by were now becoming visible. Was this, then, the
part of the Beautiful City that he had tried to persuade
Kitty was like Venice ? He looked at the place with a
new interest (comparing it with the Fulham Road), and
perhaps also, as he thought of Kitty, with a trifle of com-
punction. But at all events it was picturesque enough-
these masses of tall, narrow, variously-built houses in all
sorts of architecture; their slate fronts, their red-brick fronts,
their plaster fronts, their stone fronts, their bow windows,
flat windows, and French windows, all shining in the sun;
and their uneven sky-line sharp against the blue; and if he
did make that bold comparison to Kitty, no doubt he
pointed out to her that they were standing on an island;
that there was actually water running below the street; the
street itself leading down there to the canal-like Lee, with
its busy quays and boats and bridges. He looked at his
watch-it was half-past nine; would Kitty chance to have
put on that pretty soft gray silk dress he was so fond of,
with its touch of deep crimson here and there? Poor
Kitty; she did not know he was down here by St. Patrick's
bridge, looking at the boats.
He crossed the river and began to ascend leisurely
enough the steep and rugged little thoroughfare leading to
Audley Place. Every step had an interest for him ; he
recognised every feature of it—the red road, the white walls
hot in the sun, the soft green of the foliage, here and there
the golden tresses of a laburnum hanging over from a
garden. And Kitty had to toil up this steep ascent on the
dark nights going home-sometimes getting wet, too, for
want of a covered car. That was because the Prince had
not found his bag of diamonds yet. Never mind : the
world had not come to an end merely because Mr. Gifford
did not like the review of “ Daphne's Shadow ;” and Kitty
might have even something better than a covered car, all in
due time.
At length he reached the little terrace on the top of the
hill that is known as Audley Place; and he passed along to
the end, so that Kitty should not see him prematurely;
and leaned his arms on the red stone wall that enclosed a

meadow, in the long grass of which rooks were loudly
cawing. How well he knew the spacious picture that now
lay before him; of Cork, and its surroundings, and the
outlying country. The bulk of the city, it is true, lay down
there in the hollow to the left; a dishevelled heap of purple
slate roofs softened over by a pale blue smoke; with masses
of dark green foliage farther up the valley, and a glimmer
here and there of the Lee. But then from the deep of this
ravine the hill opposite him sloped gradually upward, the
slate roofs becoming less and less dense, until in mid-air
rose erect and tall and square the dark red tower of St.
Anne's, which holds the Shandon bells; at the foot of it
the little churchyard, with its gray stones, and the green
and gold of grass and buttercups together. Then, still
getting higher, the houses grow fewer; the sunlight catching
here and there on a white gable among the gardens; the
town loses itself in the country; there are lush meadows
dotted with sheep; there are tall hedges powdered with
hawthorn blossom; there is a farmhouse half hidden
among the elms. And then, finally, the long, softly undulat-
ing sky-line, brilliant in the sunny green of the spring-time,
meets the tender aerial blue of the morning sky, and we
reach the limits of what is visible from the red stone wall
or even from Kitty Romayne's window behind us.
Master Willie's heart was very full; for there was not a
wide thoroughfare in that dusky city, no, nor a little
bypath in the suburbs, nor a winding road leading through
the fair green country beyond, that he and Kitty had not
made themselves familiar with in their long perambulations.
And Shandon tower over there—how could he forget the
pretty speech she made him when he had casually said it
was odd of the builders to have made this one side of it
next them red and the other three sides gray? “I am
going to be like Shandon steeple, Willie ; and the rose-red
side of my love will always be turned to you; and other
people may think me gray if they like.” Perhaps it was a
trifle incoherent; but Kitty was not a literary person; and
at all events he knew what she meant.
The slow hands of Shandon clock were now invisibly
drawing towards half-past ten; and so he thought he would

go round the corner and await her there, where their
meeting could be observed by no one. He paced up and
down by this tall gray cheerless stone wall; and he wished
the villain rooks would not make such a cawing. But
nevertheless the silence was sufficient to let him hear the
swinging of a gate. Then he listened-his heart like to
choke him. Then-he could not tell how it happened—
the world became just filled with a wild delight ; for here
was the identical soft gray dress, and the pretty little figure;
and Kitty herself, who was passing him without looking
up. But what was this? Was she crying? Was she
trying to hide her face from any stranger ?
“Kitty !—Kitty, what is the matter?"
She turned instantly—the wet eyes startled, her face
grown suddenly pale ; and then, after one second of wild
bewilderment and joy, she threw herself sobbing and crying
into his arms.
“Oh, it is you after all, Willie! I thought you were
coming to-day; I thought of it all the morning; and then
to come out and find no one- "
“But how could you think I was coming, my darling ?”
he cried.
“Oh, I don't know, I don't know,” she said, almost
wildly, “something in a letter, I think-see, I put on the
dress you liked—I made so sure—but, but-oh, you have
come to me after all, Willie”-and with that she kissed
him, and kissed both his hands, and kissed the sleeve of
his coat half-a-dozen times, holding his arm tight the while
-"Oh, don't go away again, Willie! Don't leave me
again! I cannot live without you—it is not living at all.
You won't go away again, Willie, will you? We will live
on nothing rather !"
The light that was shining in her eyes as she regarded
him!
“And they haven't altered your looks a bit, Willie—not
one bit. My bonny boy! Promise me you'll never,
never, never go away again, Willie !"
“Well, you audacious creature !” he said, putting
straight the pretty little gray hat with its crimson feather,
" Whose fiery ambition was it sent me away?”.

“Oh, but I've found out my fault; and haven't I cried
enough about it too? I don't want any more ambition ; I
want you, Willie ; and I'd work for you if I were to work
my fingers off !”
But at this moment a smart young corporal having
emerged from the gate of the barracks, came along the
road, whistling “Garryowen” and twirling his small cane.
So Kitty had to dry her eyes and look presentable; and
she slipped her hand into her lover's arm: and they
proceeded on their way—well known to both of them.
“That is a most praiseworthy sentiment, Kitty," he said
in answer to her proposal. “I suppose you would sing in
the streets; and I could enjoy myself in an ale-house with
a long pipe—isn't that how it generally ends ? But now
that I've begun, I'm going on; and some day or other
Kitty won't have to get wet through in going home from a
concert at night- "
"Oh, Willie, that is too cruel ! Did I ever complain ?
What a stupid I was to mention it even --"
“Never mind. You see, I've got a very fair start,
Kitty-four pounds a week for a half-mechanical kind of
work that will leave me many chances of getting ahead in
other directions. And what have you to say now, Miss
Romayne, about the person you suspected so much ? I
think you ought to be grateful to him. I don't know any
one else who would have so gone out of his way to befriend
a stranger "
“That's like you," said Miss Romayne, promptly.
" You're too simple. My dearest, you think everybody's
like yourself. Don't I see through your“ fine friend ?
Everything you have told me in your letters confirms it. I
can see it. The fact is, he never thought about that
magazine until he saw you at Inisheen; and then he thought
he could make some use of such an unusual combination
of knowledge of all kinds of out-of-door sports along
with literary genius_ _"
“Hillo, Kitty; we're on the line of high phrases.”
“Oh,” she said coolly, "if you don't know what you are
I do. It was you who gave him the idea of the magazine
--I will wager anything "

“ A kiss ?"
“Yes—and pay you now if you like."
By this time they had got to the end of Fairy Lane-
which may be a Fairy Lane enough in certain circumstances,
though as a matter of fact it has a gaunt stone wall on one
side and a row of commonplace little cottages on the other
—and were making their way round by the back of the
barracks, by rugged little roads and crumbling walls and
stunted hedges, to the open country.
“I say," continued Miss Romayne, “that he got the
idea of that magazine from you. Gratitude, indeed! Where
else could he have found any one fit for such a place ?
Where else could he have got any one who knows all about
hounds, and horses, and salmon, and things like that;
and who has the education, and ability, and humour of a
delightful writer to make it all-all-all just delightful ?”
“But wait a minute, Kitty," said he, "are you so sure
about all those nice things ? I know I can shoot
snipe "
“ And you once brought down a wild duck," said Kitty
demurely. “Crippled her entirely—she couldn't fly away
a wee bit ever after."
“But I want you to be just to Hilton Clarke-but for
the post he has given me do you think I'd be here this
morning ?-and I want to assure you, Kitty, that everybody
doesn't regard my literary masterpieces as you do. I told
you about the review I had written. Of course I should have
been awfully glad to get an article in the Liberal Review-
even if it had been only three times a year. I never
dreamed of such a thing being possible "
“Yes; but it is possible? You told me "
“I called on Mr Gifford on Friday. Oh, he wouldn't
have it at all.”
But Kitty was not the one to be daunted.
“ The more fool he !” she said with decision. Nay,
she stamped her little foot, and said : “And if he were
here I would tell him so! Why, these old fossils are all
running in grooyes- ”
“But fossils don't run in grooves, Kitty."
.“ And they can't recognise fresh talent," she continued,

.
not heeding him in her wrath. “How could they be ex-
pected to recognise yours? You haven't been brought up
in libraries and inky dens all your life. You have been
brought up face-to-face with the real things of the world—with
the sea, and the sky, and dark nights, and the winter, and
all about Inisheen that you have told me. That's living ;
that's not talking about living ; or earning your bread by writ-
ing about what other people have said about living. What
would Mr. Gifford have done when the ship came ashore at
Kenyane Head? Do you think he could have scrambled
down the cliffs to help the fishermen- ".
“But his business is to write, Kitty- "
“It is not; it is to write about other people's writing,"
she said, promptly. “Why, I'd like to have seen him write
that description of that very thing—the struggles of the
fishermen, and then the captain's wife refusing to be saved
because her child was drowned. Would there have been
any need to cry if he had written it? Would they have got up
a subscription if he had written it ? No, I think not. And
I should like to see him try to throw a salmon-line thirty-
five yards! And do you think he could have climbed up
the face of the Priest's Rock with a gun in his hand ?".
“But these things are not necessary to the editing of a
paper, Kitty," said he, laughing. “And it's very kind of you
to try and find excuses; but I am afraid the truth was that
I wrote a bad review, and Mr. Gifford properly said no.
Well, I was very down-hearted about it- " .
“You !" she exclaimed, with a smile of scepticism.
“No, you can't make me believe that. The thing isn't in
existence that is likely to turn your hair gray."
“Unless it's you yourself, Kitty ?—what do you say to
that? But I was ; entirely down in my boots; for I'd
rather see an article of mine printed in the Liberal Review
than be made Lord Lieutenant and live at the Castle.
And then I walked along a bit ; and then I thought that
the hawthorn must be out about the woods and hedges
here, and that you would be having your Sunday morning
walk all alone; and then I said to myself, 'I'm going to see
Kitty, whatever happens !""
“And if it was Mr. Gifford that led you to say that,

Willie, I'll forgive him; though I still think him a stupid
person who doesn't know his own interests. Oh, I made
so sure you would be at the gate this morning! You told
me last week always to look out for the unexpected, or
something like that; and what do I care to expect about,
or think about, except you? I haven't had on this dress
since you left; I thought I would keep it till you came
back. Miss Patience said this morning, 'Catherine, why
are you taking out that gray dress again ?' and I said,
Well, I can't have all my things saturated with camphor;
I must take them out and air them sometimes. And
then when I came out and saw no one-1-I thought
it was too bad. I don't know whether I was angry
with you, or with myself, or London and the tall yellow
man-
spiteful on such a morning? See here is a bit of hawthorn;
let me pin it on for you. I thought the hawthorn would
- be out. The hedges over there look as if there was snow
on them.”
By this time their arm-in-arm loiterings and meanderings
had brought them within view of a spacious tract of country
that lay fair in the warm and clear sunlight. The land-
scape, it is true, was somewhat marred by certain tall
chimneys that rose in the valley below, with mountains of
refuse hard by, and a coal-black railway line twisting
through ; but there was no need for them to look that way
unless they liked. Here on these sunny uplands were
still meadows all bestarred with daisies; and hedges white
with the fresh-scented May; and over there were softly-
foliaged woods all in the tender green of the springtime.
Then the fair mansion on that distant hill— looking so
white among the trees; had its stately repose any attraction
for youthful eyes and thoughts? Was there any dream of
resting in some such place, away above the din of the
world, after the fight and stress was over? Or rather,
were not such ambitions quite unthought of? Was it not
enough for them to have this still beautiful morning, the
sunlight on the warm meadows, the skies blue above them ;
to have life, love, and youth; a pressure of the hand, a

glance of kindly eyes, perhaps a swiftly snatched kiss where
the hedges were tall? For indeed the place was so still
and silent on this fair morning that they were suddenly
startled by a peculiar silken whistling noise in the air, and
looking up they found that an equally startled rook had
just flown over their heads and was already half-way across
the meadow behind.
She stooped and picked a germander speedwell from
the bank, kissed it, and gave it to him.
“It is just the colour of your eyes, Willie,” she said.
“ They keep reminding me of you when I am out walking;
and oh ! it is so lonely walking now! I have to go over
all the things you ever said to me; it is my only company.
I say to myself 'Here we quarrelled ;' and again 'Here
we made it up;' and 'There's the stile he helped me over,
and caught me when I jumped down;' and 'Here's where
the anemones used to grow, that he used to put in my
hair.' Then on I go again ; thinking of all the nice love-
names you used to call me ; and not a human being to say
a civil word to one—nothing but the cows staring at you,
and the flowers all occupied with their own business of drink-
ing in the sunlight. And of course every one else you meet
is sure to have a companion- "
“Never mind, Kitty,” said he. “You'll have plenty of
society in Dublin ; you will have half the young officers
from the barracks wanting to get introduced to you."
“Oh, indeed !” she said. “Indeed! I'd ask them if
they had learned their drill yet; and if there wasn't one
part of it called 'Right-about-face. But it is very nice of
you not to object to my going to Dublin, Willie. You see,
it will be a six weeks' engagement; and for me a six weeks'
holiday as well ; and no silk dresses, or gloves, or music,
or bouquets to buy. And they say the picture of Killarney
is quite lovely; and just imagine how effective it will be-
the lights in the theatre all down ; then the moonlight
begins to show on Muckross Abbey, perhaps, or perhaps
it's Innisfallen, and all the water begins to be silver, and
then the orchestra plays a very slow accompaniment; and
then-I am going to begin very softly- you hear 'By
Killarney's lakes and fells' sung somewhere in the distance !

“WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG” 83
You must imagine it to be a voice in the air; and won't I
do my best with it when it is my boy's native country that
it is all about! Ah me! there won't be anybody then to
sing my praises in the Cork Chronicle. It will no longer
be reserved for an English singer to reveal to the Irish
people the pathos of anything at all. No; the only one
she ever cared to sing for will be far away ; not thinking
of her ; but having fine dinners in his splendid rooms in
London."
He burst out laughing.
“My splendid room in the Fulham Road, Kitty, is
furnished with one table and two chairs, and is otherwise
about as bare as a billiard-ball. You don't get much
splendour for six shillings a week.”
“Ah,” she said shyly, “ if you had only stayed in Ireland,
you might have had lodgings cheaper than that.”
“Where?” he asked.
“You might,” said she, very prettily, and with her eyes
cast down, "you might have lived in my heart, and paid
no rent.'”
However, not once during this long, delicious ramble
along lanes, and by farmhouses, and through woods, did
Miss Romayne recur to that first eager heart-cry of hers
that he should give up his ambitious projects in London
and come back to Ireland. For although she could make
love very prettily, in a shy, tender, and bewitching fashion,
she was nevertheless a sensible young woman; and she
perceived that, whether she liked Mr. Hilton Clarke or not,
he was affording her lover a very fair start in London
literary life. No, she would not ask him to sacrifice those
prospects merely to gratify sentiment; but seeing that he
was here—and seeing that merely to touch the sleeve of
his coat, to know that he was beside her, was the greatest
delight in the world to her-her first thought was how he
and she could be most together.
“When do you go back, Willie ?”
“ To-morrow morning.”
“To-morrow morning !” she cried; and her face fell.
" Must you?"
“My darling, I must; without a doubt.”

“But this is dreadful, Willie. Am I only to see you
for three hours-and-and the three hours nearly over- "
Her eyes began to fill; and her lips to tremble.
“What do you mean, Kitty? The whole day is before
us "
“There's dinner at two," she said, with her eyes turned
aside from him, “and there's church in the afternoon;
and then Miss Patience will expect me to stay in all the
evening; and how can I see you? Three hours—and it
may be years again--
“Oh, but that won't do at all, Kitty,” said he, cheerfully.
“I haven't come all this way to spend a day with you, and
have half of it cut off. Not a bit. I am going to call on
Miss Patience. I am going to apologise for any and every
offence that she can think of—for I'm sure I don't know
what I've done. She may draw up a list as long as my
arm-or as long as her face, which is longer—and I'll
write at the foot of it ' Peccavi peccatum grande, et mihi
conscius multorum delictorum, sed gratiâ Patientiæ- that's
through the favour of Miss Patience, Kitty—I've been
acquitted.'”
Kitty's face rose again.
“And I think it could be managed, Willie, if you
wouldn't mind being a little considerate. I have found
out what made most of the mischief. You printed a letter
of hers in the Cork Chronicle."
“I know I did; I thought she would be pleased.”
“But she sent it anonymously.”
“I only appended her initials. I recognised the hand-
writing; and it was a sensible enough letter. I thought
she would be pleased.”
“But you don't understand, Willie; I must tell you
about poor old Patience; though it is absurd. You see
she takes a great interest in public affairs; and thinks she
is in a good position for being an impartial adviser—not
influenced by interested motives, you understand, Willie-
and so she writes letters to the newspaper-editors through-
out the country, and to the Cabinet ministers, and advises
them. She writes and approves of what they've said; or she
suggests things they should do; and of course sometimes

they do do that, and then poor old Patience is very
delightful to live with, for she'll let you do anything on
these days. But then she believes that, if her name was
known, all her influence in public affairs would fade away,
for the public men would think she was wanting something
from them; and so she writes anonymously. Then you
must néeds go and discover her secret, and put her initials
to the letter- "
“There was no harm in the letter, Kitty. It only said
that on some particular question, I forget what, we were
the only paper in the country that spoke the truth; and
every editor likes to print letters like that."
“Then the very next day, I believe, you must needs
go and say something about editors being plagued with
correspondence; and that she took to herself— "
“I wasn't even thinking of her, Kitty; though anything
more diabolical than a women who spends her life in
torturing editors and Cabinet ministers with continual
writing to them "
“Whish-sh-sh. Many a pleasant evening you owe
to Miss Patience, young man. So now I'm going in to
dinner. No, you mustn't think of it; I will manage it;
men always bungle these things ; and if you go and get
your dinner, and be back about here at three, I will send
you a message somehow as to how the weather looks. Oh,
where are you staying, Willie ?”.
“At the Imperial.”
Sure, can't ye say the Impayrial ?” remonstrated Miss
Romayne. “Very well, then, I will try to send a line to
you there."
"Is it much use ?” he asked. “I am coming to spend the
afternoon with you, Kitty, whatever kind of weather there is.”
“Go away, now, you headstrong boy. You may have
command over Don Fierna and his pixies in that dreadful
glen; but you don't know how to inanage a woman's
temper. Good-bye, Willie-oh, dear me, how I shall hate
the sermon !"
“Good-bye, Kitty. Tell Miss Patience that I know
quite well whose advice it was that induced the American
Government to give up Mason and Slidell.”

He went down to the Imperial, and got something to
eat. He was not much distressed about what was going
to happen; he would see Kitty that afternoon, and that
evening too, despite all the female diplomatists in Ireland
or out of it. But in about half an hour any little anxiety
was dispelled by the following note, hastily scribbled in
pencil, which was brought him by a shock-headed boy.
"MY DEAREST—I have mollyfied (sic) Miss Patience.
She has said you might come to supper, at eight. If you
are about the front of St. Anne's, when afternoon church
comes out, I will go for a little walk with you; but let me
leave Miss Patience first; she would not like an explanation
in the street. Shall you be in the church? I will look out
for you. Do, do be civil to her to-night.
“Your much obliged,
“CATHERINE THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE.”
So they had another long and delightful walk in the
sunny afternoon; though this time they remained nearer
the city, visiting various spots that were hallowed by their
own wonderful experiences, and on one occasion standing
mute to hear the distant chiming of Shandon Bells. Kitty
was most interested in listening to the smallest details about
his life in London ; but nothing that he could urge could
overcome her dislike-or jealousy, or whatever it was—of
Hilton Clarke. This was the more unreasonable that she
had never spoken a word to him ; and had only seen him
once or twice in front of the inn at Inisheen. Even about
his appearance, which to ordinary eyes seemed handsome
and distinguished, nothing would please her. He looked
finical. He looked supercilious. He stared impertinently.
Wasn't his high priest his tailor? And so forth.
“But you shouldn't say that," Master Willie remon-
strated. “He never said anything against you. No, he
was quite complimentary. He called you an epichoriambic
trimeter acatalectic.”
“I'll take that with a little water, please; it's rather
strong,” she said, saucily.
“I wish you'd give over your concert - room slang!"
said he.


## p. 87 (#99) ##############################################

“WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG” 87
“Oh, slang !" she said. “Slang ! and what was that
you said, then? Wasn't that slang, or worse?".
“It's the description of a verse in Horace-a verse that
is just as musical and graceful as you yourself, Kitty, when
you like to behave yourself, which isn't often. And if you
had any gratitude in your miserable little soul- "
“Oh, thank you,” she said, snatching her hand away
from his arm. “Mr. Impertinence, that's the way to your
hotel. I'm going home.” .
But Kitty's wrath was usually evanescent; you had but to
take her hand and she surrendered; and so it was that they
were very soon climbing the steep little hill together, with
much cheerfulness, in the gathering dusk, the while Kitty
was lecturing her companion on the wisdom of consider-
ation, and the advantages of politeness, and also hinting
that, if he could but introduce the names of one or two
distinguished political persons into his talk that evening, no
harm would be done. And as it turned out, Miss Patience,
who was a thin tall lady, with a somewhat dark face and
severe gray eyes that made her look like a hawk, proved
exceedingly placable. She avoided all reference to the
quarrel. She hoped he was succeeding in London. Then
she lit two candles and put them on the table of the little
parlour; and drew down the window-blind; and rang the
bell for supper.
Master Willie returned her kind treatment of him with
liberal interest. For when the little maidservant had come
- in to lay the cloth, and when she had placed thereon the
cold beef, and salad, and cheese, and bottled stout, and
when Miss Romayne had, in honour of her guest, lit two
more candles and put them on the chimney-piece, then
they all sate down to the modest banquet, and Fitzgerald
proceeded to inform Miss Patience as to what was being
thought in London concerning some topics of Imperial
interest. And he listened with profound attention to her
views on these wide subjects; although, it is true, she
spoke with much caution, and even mystery, as though she
were afraid of revealing secrets. She was anxious, above
all, to know whether the public approved the line the
Times was taking with regard to the Government; and


## p. 88 (#100) #############################################

SHANDON BELLS
also what sort of person the Editor of the Times was.
Master Willie replied that he had met one or two highly
distinguished literary people in London ; but not the
Editor of the Times ; who was no doubt, on account of
his position and duties, one not easily approachable.
“There again Sir Rowland Hill comes in !” exclaimed
Miss Patience, triumphantly.
Fitzgerald looked puzzled.
“Think of how we are indebted to him," she continued
-forgetting for the moment her mysterious manner—" for
the diffusion of information, and for breaking down con-
ventional barriers. Nowadays nobody has to bribe lacqueys
to get to the great man's chamber. The penny post has
done away with that. That is the messenger who cannot
be denied. The humblest in the land can reach even to
the throne.”
Gracious heavens, thought Master Willie, has the woman
been writing to the Queen ? But all the same he agreed
with her ; the penny post was a noble institution; and if
she referred to the Editor of the Times no doubt he was
approachable that way. But Miss Patience, fixing her
severe eyes on him, instantly disclaimed any such allusion.
No; she declared she was merely thinking of the system;
and of its wonderful advantages of communication between
humble people and the great. Then she grew mysterious
again; and began to put dark questions to him about the
probable effect of a certain Royal marriage then being
talked of, and whether it was not high time that the voice
of the people should be heard.
But the evening was not entirely given up to politics;
for Miss Patience, with the kindest consideration, and
under the pretext of going to search for some papers in her
own room, disappeared, and remained absent; and Kitty
went to the little cottage piano; and her companion was
not a great way off. Miss Romayne, if not a highly
finished musician, was at least a sympathetic player; and
well she knew the airs which would awaken the tenderest
associations in her lover's heart. They were those that he
had listened to when he and she were idling away the glad
hours along country lanes or as they came home through

“WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG" 89
Inisheen in the evening, thinking of all the things that life
had in store for them together.
“And so the Irish people,” she said, letting her fingers
touch the keys very gently, “were not aware of the pathos
of 'The Bells of Shandon' until I revealed it to them ?".
“I wasn't,” said he, “and as I was the sub-editor of the
Cork Chronicle, hadn't I the right to speak in the name of
the Irish people ?”
"I wonder who first began to make words for these old
tunes. I suppose the tunes were in existence ages ago.
Oh, that wasn't much of a discovery, Master Willie, because
everybody sees how the air can be made pathetic if you
take pains with it; but what I am certain of is that another
bell-song, “The Bells of Aberdovey,' was originally not a
sentimental thing at all, but a splendid battle-march of the
old Britons. If this wasn't Sunday evening; and if I
wasn't afraid of frightening the neighbours, I could let you
hear something with "The Bells of Aberdovey. Now,
there is a task for you; write a war-song for that splendid
march—a war-song with a tramp in it and thunder !"
“Play 'Farewell, but whenever you welcome the hour,'
Kitty," said he, gently. “You remember you sang it in the
boat coming back to Inisheen ?”.
“Do I remember? Am I ever likely to forget that
fearful night,” said she, “when I signed my soul away to
witches in the moonlight ?"
But she played the air, nevertheless ; very exquisitely
and softly. And she played many more, wandering from
one to the other, while he listened in silence and dreamed
over again the mornings, and the clear days, and the silent
twilights they had spent so happily together. And well she
knew-for she also had a tender memory—that however
familiar these airs might be to others, there was no
commonplaceness about them for him. She played one
and then another ; but it seemed as if they were all
speaking of the sea, and of Inisheen, and of glad days gone
by. These two were together so close now; the world
shut out and forgotten. Why should there be any cruel
gray dawn; and a wide gray sea : and then a disappearance
into the frightful loneliness of London ?

But the parting had to come, nevertheless-out there by
the small gate, under the stars. Kitty was crying a little
bit; what was the use of his coming over for one day only
to have all the old sorrow to go through again ? And then
he chid her gently. Had it not been a long, happy, idyllic
day-something to look back upon, perhaps for years ?
Was it not enough that even now, under the clear shining
stars, he could hold her warm little hands for yet one other
minute, and listen to the smooth and tender voice that he
knew? Perhaps Kitty would rather not have him come
back, then?
. “Oh yes, oh yes,” the faltering voice said, and she drew
him closer to her, “never mind about the excuse, Willie.
To-morrow—Wednesday–next week—any day, any hour,
come back to me! That's all I want! And it isn't so
much; and other people seem to have everything they
want; and they are not nearly as grateful as I should be.
Ah, must you really go ?”
But the last word took a long while in saying; and even
after she had given him the last kiss and the last blessing ;
and when she had watched him disappear away into the
darkness of the night, she still stood by the little gate there,
trying in vain to dry her eyes before going into the house
again, and wondering why fate should be so cruel to some,
while others were so happy.

CHAPTER VIII.
IN LONDON AGAIN.
At length the fateful day arrived for the issuing to the
British public of the first number of the new magazine, and
Fitzgerald was glad to be able to draw a long breath of
relief. During these past two or three weeks his labours
had been indeed hard. He had been constituted a sort of
intermediary between the managerial and the editorial
departments, everybody wanting to hold him responsible
for everything.
“Mr. Fitzgerald,” the distressed manager would say,
bringing him the proof of an article written by the editor.
“Do look here, if you please. The vile decoctions being
continually invented and supplied to the public in the
shape of effervescing drinks.'”
“Well ?” said Fitzgerald on that particular occasion.
“Why not? where's the harm ?”.
“We've eleven different firms,” cried the manager,
almost in despair, “advertising their effervescing drinks
and mineral waters !”.
“They must imagine sporting people to be a thirsty
race,” said Fitzgerald, laughing. “Very well, I'll get Mr.
Clarke to take the phrase out, if it's likely to hurt any-
body."
Then again Mr. Scobell would call in some morning,
perhaps with a proof of the same article in his hand.
“Look here, Fitzgerald. Look here, my dear f'lah.
This won't do at all. You'll shock the public, I tell you
you'll shock the public. Look at this—that numerous

and important section of the British wealthier classes who
have long ago given up the fear of God, but who are kept
in pretty fair social order by the fear of gout.' It won't do,
Fitzgerald, I tell you it won't do. You must ask Clarke to
cut that out. I told him I wouldn't have any d-d
atheistical Radical stuff in a paper I was responsible for ;
I'm not going into sassiety as the proprietor of a d-d
Radical and atheistical journal.”
But this was a far more serious matter, for if Hilton
Clarke were to know that Mr. Scobell had been furnished
with proofs of the articles, or had expressed any opinion
about them, there would be the very mischief to pay. So
Master Willie had to assure the capitalist that the most
perverse ingenuity could not discover a trace of atheism or
Radicalism in any one of the contributions that had been
written for the Household Magazine, that Hilton Clarke
would be perfectly astonished to hear of any such charge
being brought against him, but at the same time, if there
was a chance of any stupid person being offended by this
chance remark of Hilton Clarke's, no doubt he, Clarke,
would at once remove it.
Then he would go up to the Albany, and make some
casual suggestions, in as pleasant a way as he could.
“Well, you see, Fitzgerald,” Hilton Clarke said,
promptly, in answer to these timid proposals, “I'm not
going to edit the magazine in the interests of the advertising
department. They'll want us to puff pianos next, and write
reviews of window-curtains. And what idiot could be
offended by a little joke like that? We can't write down
to the microcephalous. Where are you going now?”.
“I am going to have some luncheon, I think.”
“Ah,” said his chief, regarding him, “I suppose you
can afford to do that now. But it is not wise. Nothing
so certainly destroys the figure in time. . I don't know how
many years it is now since I gave it up: nothing between
eleven and eight is my rule. Oh, by the way, can you
help me? have you sufficient ingenuity to suggest the kind
of present one might buy for a lady—well, how am I to
explain it? Something that will not be merely for vulgar
use—such as she would have to buy in any case; and yet

on the other hand something pretty that would not attract
too much attention as a gift.”
"I don't quite understand,” said Fitzgerald.
“It is difficult to define," said the other, absently. “I
have been puzzling over it myself. I daren't give her a
piece of jewellery; for that would provoke questions. And
of course I wouldn't give her a piece of furniture, or
costume, or anything she would buy in the ordinary course
with her husband's money. That's the difficulty, and I
can't hit on the juste milieu. It must be ornamental
enough for a gift, and yet something she might have bought
for herself—~"
“What about a cigar-case ?” said Master Willie, at a
venture.
The other laughed.
“Very well hit. You're not far from the mark. But
I think a cigar-case would not precisely have the effect of
staving off awkward questions. Well, if you are going to
lunch, ta-ta ! Be prudent, and you'll be thankful at forty
that you've still got a waist.”
Now Hilton Clarke had a vein of light facetiousness in
his nature, and but little satire; moreover, he was good-
natured in a selfish and indolent sort of way. But he
never nearer reached a sharp satirical stroke than when he
advised this poor lad, who was on the verge of starvation,
not to destroy his figure by over eating and drinking. The
fact was that despite the most rigid economies Fitzgerald's
worldly wealth was reduced to a sum of a few shillings,
and that was slowly diminishing. The Irish trip had cost
nearer three than two pounds. His father had written
asking for two pounds more to make up the money to meet
the bill, and he had got it. Then on the remainder Fitz-
gerald had continued to exist, if not to live, during these
past three weeks and more. He gave up his only luxury
—that single glass of ale with his dinner. The amount of
walking he did was incredible, for he had much hurrying to
and fro, and he would not take an omnibus. The luncheon
that Hilton Clarke had warned him against generally con-
sisted of a biscuit, with sometimes an apple. And he had
given up going in to see his artist friend John Ross, because

SHANDON BELLS
he could not ask him in return to a banquet of tinned
meat, bread, and beer.
His salary having begun four weeks before, the House-
hold Magazine now owed him a sum of £16; and if that
money had been in the hands of Mr. Silas Earp, or owing
to him by the proprietor, Mr. Scobell, he would not have
had the slightest hesitation in making application for it.
But somehow or other—he could not himself strictly analyse
the feeling—it was impossible for him to go and ask for the
money from Hilton Clarke, in whose hands he understood
it was. He was certain that if Clarke knew he was in want
of it, he would have it at once. No doubt it was owing to
mere carelessness that he had not had it already. And to
go and confess his need of it: would not that be almost
like bringing a charge of want of consideration against one
who had greatly befriended him? There may have been
a little pride mixed up in this feeling ; an indisposition to
confess that, having scarcely a penny left in the world, he
could not write home to his own people for supplies. But
the chief notion he had was undoubtedly that such an appeal
would cause Hilton Clarke to be vexed about his own
thoughtlessness; and Fitzgerald was a trifle sensitive him-
self; and did not like the thought of giving that pain to
any one else. And so he contentedly trudged all over
London (the printing offices were in the City Road) instead
of taking omnibuses; and he lived on next to nothing ;
and gave up-but this was hard-his nightly chat with
Ross, rather than make an application that would cause
Hilton Clarke to accuse himself of inconsiderateness.
This conduct may have been Quixotic; the only sure
thing about it was that it could not go on for ever. That
small stock of jealously-guarded shillings grew fatally
smaller and smaller.
On the afternoon of the day on which the Household
Magazine was finally issued, Hilton Clarke, Fitzgerald,
Silas Earp, and Mr. Scobell left London by one of the
afternoon boats for Greenwich, to dine there at the
invitation of the last-named. It was not merely the
prospect of having for once a substantial dinner that put
Master Willie in good spirits. They were all in good
'It was al dinnell in

95
spirits. So far as could be judged, the new venture
promised to be successful. The quantity of advertisements
that had been secured was remarkable. The “trade” had
subscribed liberally for the first number; in fact, the last
thing that had to be done before they went down to Charing
Cross was to send word to the City Road to print a further
five hundred copies. The poster, scarlet letters on a white
ground, was effective; it was conspicuous on the hoardings
they passed ; and needless to say, they looked out for it.
Mr. Scobell talked as if the whole scheme had been his
own; and pooh-poohed his manager's cautious reminders
to the effect that the advertisers were always willing to
patronise a first number, and that the sale could not be
even approximately gauged until they began to get back
the "returns.” The capitalist would not hear of any such
qualifications. He was assured of success. The richer
section of the public could not fail to see what an invaluable
manual this would make. Even with a moderate sale the
margin of profit at a shilling would be large. And so he
paid for all their tickets to Greenwich.
Fitzgerald had not been down the Thames before, and
to him it was a wonderful and a beautiful sight; the
summer afternoon shining warm on the masses of ship-
ping, on the gray Tower, on the surging stream. And
then, when they reached Greenwich and the hotel there,
and when he went out on to the balcony of the little private
room, there was something that was more than beautiful in
the sunset streaming along the wide reach of the river,
There was a touch of the pathetic in it. That very wide-
ness suggested the nearness of the sea. And was not the
sea the great bond of association with those who were far
away? He thought of Inisheen; and that seemed sad;
for now there would be no Fairy Frigate—that was the
fanciful name that Kitty had given to the boat he and she
used to go out to row in—there would be no Fairy Frigate
gliding over the golden waters, with the blades of the oars
shining in the sunlight as they dipped and rose again.
Cannot you take her a message, then, you wide, rushing
waters, and you, great ships, floating down with the dying
day? Alas! the distance is too great; she is so far away

she cannot hear; and there is one whose heart is so full of
the thought of her, and so burdened with the sadness of
being remote from her, that he has not much of a mind for
the festivities to which he is summoned within. A hand is
laid on his shoulder.
“Twenty pounds that I can tell you what you are
thinking of !” says Hilton Clarke.
Master Willie starts up from his reverie.
“She looks like a Norwegian,” he says, “the barque
there with the green hull."
And yet after all, when they had sat down to the very
elaborate feast prepared within, and when their host was
descanting on the merits of one or two of the wines he had
ordered, the humour of the situation, so far as he, that is
Fitzgerald, was concerned, could not escape him. It
seemed to him that all the dinners he had not had for the
past month were now being offered him, when he could
make no use of them. It looked ridiculous that one who
had been living on next to nothing should find himself
able, nay, constrained, to send away dish after dish only
tasted, when tasted at all.
“To-morrow," he said to himself, “when I shall be
feeling myself very hollow about two o'clock, I shall be
saying, 'What a fool I was, then, not to have had some
more of that turbot !' This wine, now. Twelve shillings
a bottle, I suppose. Six glasses to the bottle, probably;
two shillings a glass. I drink it; and I have drunk what
would have kept me in beer for a week. There is some-
thing wrong about the constitution of the human organism.
When you can get plenty to eat and drink, you ought to be
able to lay in a store against future need. What is the use
of all this to me, if I am to be hungry again to-morrow?”.
“Well, now, gentlemen," said he of the red face and
the bristly yellow-white whiskers, as he held up a glass of
wine between him and the light and then put it on the
table again, “I did not ask you to come to Greenwich to
talk business; but I think we are entitled to congratulate
ourselves all round, I do really. I say it's a deuced good-
looking periodical we've turned out. I call it a respectable-
looking, a gentlemanly sort of looking magazine. I'm not

ashamed of it. I'm not ashamed to have it lying in my
drawing-room, and when any one comes in I'm not ashamed
if they take it up. What I say is, give a good thing, and
charge a good price. I think twelve shillings is too much
for this champagne, as I tell ye; but I consider it's as good
a glass of wine as any I've got in my own cellar, and so I
don't grumble. I'm for having good things. Give people
good things; and they'll pay. A shilling a week is a good
lot; but it looks respectable to have a thing like that lying
about; it looks as if you wanted a country-house or a steam-
yacht, and were looking out. My wife had it lying in her
drawing-room yesterday when Lady Ipswich called ; and
Lady Ipswich said she'd order it from her bookseller at
once. Now that's what I like; I want to have it talked
about in sassiety. And I hope, Clarke, your friend Gifford
will give us a flaming article about it; I'd have asked him
to come down to-day, but I thought we'd better be private.
I suppose you'll drop him a line ?”
“Mr. Gifford,” said Hilton Clarke, with a slight emphasis
on the “Mr.,” “is peculiar. It would be better to leave him
to discover the extraordinary merits of the shilling's worth
for himself. Oh, talking of discoveries, Fitzgerald," he
added, turning to his neighbour, "did you read the review
of ' Daphne's Shadow'?"
Fitzgerald, with a sudden flush, admitted that he had ;
but Hilton Clarke, not perceiving his embarrassment, or
whatever it might have been, laughed lightly.
“That was the Liberal Review all over. "The most
portentous discoveries ! The well-known this and the
well-known that under thin disguises : a wonderful study
of contemporary life and society in England-_"
“ Then have you read the book? Do you think it is
trumpery?” said Fitzgerald, eagerly; he was so anxious to
justify himself to himself.
“The book !" said · Hilton Clarke, with a sort of good-
natured scorn. “To call such a thing a book. Twopence-
halfpenny-worth of persiflage; the rest of the coppers in
cheek; then throw in a few allusions to current politics ;
and the British public will take your mere names as types
of English character. What Gifford will do about our

magazine it is impossible to say. He may think it trivial.
He may regard it as the servant of Mammon; and he is
not too well-affected towards the rich. But one can't say,
He may make a discovery about it; about the possibility
of converting fox-hunters to the study of higher things-
who knows? And then when he gets into a tempest of
conviction, he rides the whirlwind. He'd be willing to see
half the human race hanged to show the other half that
capital punishment was a mistake."
Well, human nature is but human nature, after all; and
it is possible that Fitzgerald, after that rejection of his
anxiously-written article, may not have been so quick as he
would otherwise have been to resent these scornful taunts
that Hilton Clarke occasionally directed against the Liberal
Review and its editor. But none of these affected Master
Willie's secret consciousness that, if the two ways of regard-
ing human life were offered him as alternatives, he would
rather have that of the Liberal Review than that of the
Weekly Gazette. The most desperate thing in the world
seemed to him to be hopelessness. Your conviction
might be wrong; but at least it gave you something to look
forward for. And at twenty-three one is busier with the
future than the past.
The evening went on pleasantly enough; and coffee
and cigars did not tend to diminish that halo of success
which already seemed to surround the new magazine.
Indeed, so satisfied was Mr. Scobell with the gentlemanly
appearance of the periodical, and with his own relations to
the enterprise, that he broadly hinted his intention of
sharing any great increase of prosperity with these coad-
jutors of his.
"I am not a money-grubber,” said he, leaning back in
his chair to watch the smoke ascend. “I don't worship
the golden calf. I like to have plenty of money; and I
have plenty of money—-".
“I wish some more of us could say as much," said
Hilton Clarke; but the remark was an unfair one, for Mr.
Scobell was not really boasting of his wealth.
“I was going to say," continued the capitalist, glancing
at Clarke somewhat reproachfully, “that I have plenty of

money because I am not an extravagant man. I think
when a man has a thorough well-managed establishment in
town, a good cook and a good cellar, a couple of hacks for
the park, a barouche for his wife, and then, don't you know,
a snug little place in the country, where he can keep a
good glass of wine for his friends, and give them a day
through the turnips, or a mount if they are hunting men,
don't you know, I say he should be content, and not want
to win the Derby or have the biggest deer-forest in Scot-
land. I haven't gone into literature to make money, not
1. What I say is, if it is a big success, let them share it
who made it- "
“Then Fitzgerald should have three-fourths," said
Hilton Clarke, with a laugh, “for he has done three-fourths
of the work."
“I don't say I wouldn't take, a fair return for my
money,” said Mr. Scobell, grandly. “I don't say that.
But when I go into literature, it isn't to make money. I
want to have my name connected with a thorough good
thing. I don't want to go into my club, and hear men
say, “That's Scobell; he's the proprietor of a d-d low
Radical print.' I say we should stick up for our own
country. I don't see any better. If there's a country
where you'll find better fighting men, and handsomer
women-ay, and horses too—well, I don't know where it
is. I think we are very well off. You can get the best
of everything in London, if you'll only pay a fair price for
it. Look at Covent Garden now; what is there you can't
get there ? And then you get a lot of low trades-unionists
and Radicals trying to stir up discontent; and setting class
against class ; and trying to put a lot of stuff into the heads
of the farm-labourers. What I say is, let well alone. I
don't see any other country better governed. I don't see
any other country better off. If Church and State have
brought us where we are, then I'm for Church and State ;
I want none otheir Liberty, Equality, and Stupidity. I
say we're precious well off.”
"You are, my dear Scobell, but I am not,” observed
Hilton Clarke, pleasantly. “However, you need have
no fear of the Household Magazine adventuring on these

troubled waters. We will assume that everything is for the
best in this favoured island; and in the meantime we had
better think of getting to the railway-station.”
Here Mr. Earp, who was a large, heavy, bilious-looking
man, and who had scarcely spoken all the evening, looked
at his watch.
“There is one thing I would like to mention," he said
slowly. “Very soon people will be leaving town.”
"Doubtless," said Hilton Clarke, whom he now parti-
cularly addressed.
“And you may be drawing attention to it in an article-
perhaps more than once,” the melancholy-looking man con
tinued.
“Well, that is possible.”
“Well, Mr. Clarke," said the other, hesitatingly, “if it
is all the same to you, I would rather not have any such
article. It is, if I may say so, imprudent. All the daily
papers do it. They have articles about London being
empty ; about the dead season; about everybody being
abroad. And then, you see, how can you ask the adver-
tisers to keep on paying money, when you're telling them
at the same time that everybody is away?”.
“Oh, I see !" exclaimed Mr. Clarke as he rose from the
table. “It is the advertisers you are thinking of?” And
then he laughed, and put his hand on Fitzgerald's shoulder
as they left the room together. “There, Fitzgerald, don't
forget these hints. Rules for the editing of a newspaper
they might be called. “Uphold Church and State ; and in
August don't remind advertisers that people have left town.'”
“We might have them printed and hung up in the office,
for the guidance of contributors,” said his companion.
They returned to town apparently very well pleased with
each other and with the prospects of the new periodical.
But just before reaching Charing Cross something occurred
which was calculated to give Fitzgerald a still more favour-
able recollection of that evening.
“I suppose you'll take a hansom, Fitzgerald ?” Hilton
Clarke asked of him casually.
“No; I'll walk," was the reply.
“ Walk? To Fulham ?”.

1οΙ
“ To the Fulham Road, at least.”
It is impossible to say whether or no this answer may
have suggested to Hilton Clarke some suspicion about
Fitzgerald's circumstances, but at all events he said, a
minute after, and apparently without premeditation-
“Oh, I quite forgot, Fitzgerald, that you've drawn no-
thing from the treasury during these past weeks. That was
my forgetfulness; for I am responsible to you. Why didn't
you remind me "
“It was of no consequence,” said Fitzgerald, hastily;
but how glad he was that Hilton Clarke had not had to be
reminded !
“Well, then, shall I give you something on account?
Oh, don't be bashful, man! This is a business evening.
I should not have been so remiss- ”
“It is of no consequence at all !” said Fitzgerald again; it
was quite enough for him that his friend had remembered.
He had had enough eating and drinking for a time. He
would willingly go back to dry biscuits and apples.
“When I was your age I knew what it was to be hard up,”
continued Hilton Clarke, “and sometimes I know it now
when paymasters are neglectful. So I'm not going to incur
that charge, whilst I remember. But I find I've only a
sovereign or two. Scobell, lend me ten pounds, like a good
fellow ; Earp can score it up against me at the office.”
“Oh, certainly,” said Mr. Scobell, though he seemed a
little surprised on hearing that Fitzgerald had up to that
moment received no salary.
The two bank-notes were handed to Clarke, who in turn
passed them on, and Fitzgerald, so far from having any
hesitation about accepting them, was altogether delighted.
He had looked forward with the utmost shrinking to the
obvious necessity, sooner or later, of having to recall Hilton
Clarke to a sense of his carelessness. It was now clear to
him that Mr. Clarke would so have regarded an application
from him—as a reminder that he had been culpably neglect-
ful. And now to find this deplorable thing removed was
an inexpressible relief; and the first thought he had was
that he would invest a portion of this sum in paying for a
ride on an omnibus, get home quickly, and see if John

Ross were still awake and at work, that he might, as he
surely would, rejoice in the good fortune of his nearest
neighbour.
When Fitzgerald reached the little courtyard in the
Fulham Road, there was no doubt possible about Ross's
being at home, whether he was at work or no, for loud and
martial strains were resounding through the big empty
studio. It was with the utmost difficulty that Fitzgerald
could make himself heard. Then the bawling suddenly
ceased, and the door was opened.
“Come in, man; come in; what's the need o' cere-
mony? What for did ye wait to knock ?”
“I heard the end of Scots wha hae' by waiting," said
Master Willie, getting a chair for himself.
“Ay," said his host, fetching him a canister of tobacco.
" I'm thinking King Edward, poor man, thought he was
never going to hear the end oʻthey Scotch folk while he
was alive. I daresay whenever he found himself with no-
thing to do—wi' half an hour to spare, like—he would say
to his friends, ‘Come and let us sit down and curse Scot-
land.' Well, now, what have ye been about; what has
come over ye ?”
“I have been very busy; but the magazine I was telling
you about has come out at last; and to-night I have just
got back from a dinner at Greenwich which was meant to
celebrate the occasion.”
“ But ye're sober !” exclaimed the other.
“Why not ?"
“What's the use o' going all that way for a dinner if ye
come home sober? Ay," said he, regarding him critically,
“but if they've sent ye back sober, they've put an extra bit
o'colour in your cheeks. It's no often one sees colour like
that in London. It's no a London complexion at a', it
reminds one more o’a cornfield in summer, and a strapping
young fellow lying by the side of a stook, wi' his face half-
turned away frae the sun. Man, I'd like to have a try at
your head. You go on smoking; and let me hear all your
story since I saw ye last. I'd just like to have a try.”
He threw aside his pipe; and quickly stuck on his easel
a sheet of light-brown board, and took up his palette and

colours. And then he began to walk up and down a bit,
ultimately putting colours on the palette, and studying
Fitzgerald's head from different points of view.
“Man," he said, "ye’ve more character about ye than I
thought. Ye'll have a fine head when ye grow up."
Fitzgerald thought he had done growing, as he was three-
and-twenty, and five foot ten. But by this time he was
familiar with Ross's way of working, and with the jerky
observations with which he usually accompanied that, and
so he did not interrupt. After a while, Ross suddenly went
to a portfolio that stood near the wall, and after having
rudely tumbled about a number of sheets he brought back
a large and dusty photograph-of Giorgione's armed warrior
in the Uffizi.
“That's what your head 'll be in middle age."
. “That! I don't see the least likeness," said Fitzgerald.
“But I do. It's my business. Of course you'll no be
dark like that; but that's your nose and forehead. Ay,
and the mouth too. But the complexion makes a great
difference; and the hair ; have ye been burning yourself in
the sun a'the day? Where got ye. that straight nose in
Ireland ?"
“I suppose there are as many there as elsewhere,” said
Fitzgerald, trying to steal a look at the board on the easel,
but failing.
“I dinna believe ye,” said Ross, who was now working
very eagerly — with snatches of contemplative whistling
coming in at intervals. “I've watched the shearers that
come over from Belfast. There's no one in twenty that
escapes from the general type— the turned-up nose and
long upper lip. Ay, and so the wonderful new magazine's
out. Well, tell us all about it, man; ye need no be feared
about altering your expression ; it's only the tan o' the
sunlight I'm trying at, though whether I can do anything-
but there's no two curls o' your hair the same colour, man !
What do ye mean by that? There's an inconsistency about
ye that's aggravating. Well, about the magazine ?”.
So Fitzgerald told him all that had happened; and
dwelt on his great good fortune in having been able to
make so early a start in London, thanks to one or two kind

friends; and said how everybody was pleased at the pro-
spects of this venture.
“Ay, ay,” said the broad-shouldered, red-bearded little
man as he stepped back a yard or two from the easel, and
regarded his handiwork, “and that may partly account for
the colour, as well as the warm day, and the trip to Green-
wich. The flush of success, eh? And I warrant there's a
young lass somewhere that's just as pleased as yoursel..."
Then he suddenly bawled out in a prodigious and
raucous voice-looking intently at his work the while-
“And we'll take a right gude willie-waught,
For the days o' auld langsyne !"
However, this vocal outburst was not the result of self-
satisfaction.
“What put it into my head,” he continued, in a series
of inconsecutive growls, as he stepped back and then
stepped forward, and then bit the end of his brush, “to
try such a blaze of flesh-colour? It's the most infernal
thing in the world. I'm a landscape painter ; at least I
say I am ; I think I'll take to house fronts and door-steps.
The portrait-painting I can do is a wee dabbie o' red and
white under an auld wife's cap if she's coming along the
road about twa miles off.
“And we'll take a right gude willie-waught'--"
But there was no joy left in the jovial song : nothing
but perplexity and irritation.
“Don't bother about it to-night," said Master Willie.
“Let's have a quiet smoke and a chat.”
The next thing he saw was Ross suddenly advance and
with one stroke drive his fist right through the frail board,
sending the easel and everything flying and sprawling across
the room. Then that action having apparently assuaged
his passion, he quietly took the palette from the thumb of
his left hand and laid it down.
“I'm a failure," he said, drawing along a chair to the
bare wooden table. “Nothing I try will do. Ye are one
o' the lucky ones; only ye dinna ken the contentment
there is in a glass o’good Scotch whisky. I do. But d'ye
such a blaz; and then bit the apped back and thes

think I'm to be cast down because I canna pent? No
while I can light a pipe !"
“But it's nonsense your talking like that !” exclaimed
Fitzgerald, who had been privileged to look over these
canvases, and who, little as he knew about painting, had
been greatly struck with the strangely vivid effects he saw
here and there, along with, as he imagined, an absolute
want of definite construction, or technical skill. Amid all
this confused chaos of impressions—which he was not sur-
prised the dealers had for the most part regarded as quite
hopeless — he had seen bits that were to him a sort of
revelation. Moreover, he had gone out once or twice into
the country with John Ross; he had listened to his talk;
had watched the things he had pointed out; and it seemed
to him that the world had grown a great deal more inter-
esting since this red-haired Scotchman had taught him how
to look at it.
“ It is nonsense your talking like that," repeated Fitz-
gerald. “And very soon the world will find out, and will
tell you, whether you can paint or not.”
“But do I complain ?" said the other, fetching over
some fresh water and a tumbler. “Do I howl ? Have
you seen me lie down on the floor and squeal ? Bless the
laddie, I've my wits left. And I'm thinking that, now this
machine o' yours is fairly on the rails, ye'd better have a
day's holiday the morn; and I'll take ye and show ye as
fine a bit o' wilderness within five miles o' this very place
as ye'd want to find in Canada. Will ye go ?”
“Won't I ?" said Master Willie, who had discovered
that a walk in the country with this keen-eyed, talkative,
dogmatic person was in itself a sort of liberal education.
But then again he added : “No: not to-morrow. We will
put it off for a few days, till I see how this thing is really
going."
“You are as cautious as a Scotchman !" said his friend,
with a laugh. “Well, here's to the magazine, and to you,
and to all good fellows; and may the black deil be aye a
long way away from us !”

CHAPTER IX.
IN STRAITS.
The high hopes that had been raised by the demand for
the first number of the Household Magazine were very
speedily abated. An ominously large number of the copies
came back unsold from the newsvendors. Worse than that,
as week after week passed, the small minimum circulation
on which, after these returns, they had calculated, showed
signs of still further shrinking. In these disheartening cir-
cumstances it must be said for Mr Scobell that he played
a man's part; he accused nobody; he was not dismayed ;
nay, he ventured even yet to hope.
“Rome wasn't built in a day," he would say. “A
shillin's a good lot. And if the public won't buy it, at all
events we've done our best. I'm not ashamed of it when
I see it on a bookstall. I'm not ashamed to see it lying
on the table of my club. I say there's nothing to be
ashamed of about it; I call it a gentlemanly looking thing.
We'll have to be content with small beginnings. Mind, a
shillin's a shillin'."
Hilton Clarke, on the other hand, was disappointed, and
inclined to be peevish, and openly laid the blame on the
management. There was no pushing of the magazine.
They had not spent enough money in advertising. Indeed,
he very soon showed that he was hopeless of the whole
affair ; and it was only by the exercise of much tact that
Fitzgerald kept him, as far as he could be kept, to his
duties as editor.
With Fitzgerald, however, he remained great friends;

107
and it was Master Willie's privilege to listen for many a
half-hour together to his companion's ingenious and clever
talking, that was full of a very curious and subtle penetra-
tion in literary matters. Once or twice it almost seemed,
to him a pity that a man who could talk so well should not
write a little more; and indeed on one occasion he went
the length of hinting to Mr. Hilton Clarke that the world
had a right to expect from him some more definite work
than he had already done. They were walking in Hyde
Park.
“You mean some substantive publication ?” said he, as
he crumbled up some bread he had brought with him and
began to throw it to the ducks in the Serpentine; this
being a favourite amusement of his. “I doubt whether
the public care - much about viewy books. They can
manage an essay now and again. I have thought of it,
though. I could bring together two or three things I have
written, under some such title as ‘Laws and Limitations of
Art.'"
“Why not?" said Fitzgerald, eagerly. Here, indeed,
would be something he could triumphantly place before
Kitty. No longer would she be able to ask of his literary
hero “What has he done?” “I am sure it would be most
interesting," he continued. “I am sure no one could make
such a subject more interesting; and it wants clearness;
there is so much confusion about it "
“But some day or other ”
“ That is what you are always saying !".
“Wait a bit. I say some day or other I mean to tackle
something with a trifle more of human nature in it. I
might begin it in the Household Magazine, only it would be
thrown away on squires. Perhaps it would not run to a
book."
“But the subject ?”.
“ The Private Meditations of Zenobia's Husband.”
“Zenobia's Husband - ?”
“I forget what the gentleman's name was; most people
do; that's the point of the situation. But you remember
that the lovely and virtuous Queen of Palmyra had a
husband; and he must have had his own little thoughts

about things. I suppose now," he continued, throwing
away the last of the crumbs, and linking his arm in his
companion's as they set out again, “I suppose now you
think that before writing such a book I ought to go and
qualify by marrying somebody.”
“You might do worse.”
“I doubt it. I shall never marry. Life is only
endurable when you have all round you an atmosphere
of possibility. Then the unexpected may happen ; each
new day may bring new relations. But when you marry
your fate is fixed; life is closed; the romance of it
vanished-
“But what do you call the romance of it?" said Fitz-
gerald, bluntly. “Going philandering after another man's
wife?"
“I perceive, Mr. Fitzgerald,” said Hilton Clarke, blandly,
“that on one occasion I must have been indiscreet. How-
ever, as you don't even know the name of the lady of the
cigars no great harm has been done. Feuerbach, if you
remember, maintains that a being without attributes is
non-existent. Now a person whose sole attribute, so far as
you know, is that she smokes cigars, can only exist a very
little bit, as far as you are concerned. The Lady Irmin-
garde, now: she wouldn't allow even a cigarette to sully
the purity of her sweet mountain air ?”.
“The Lady Irmingarde ?” Fitzgerald repeated, inno-
cently.
"I can imagine her. A coquettish nose : very blue
eyes; a little freckled ; a mischievous laugh ; and a figure
that would go charmingly in a short dress, with a milking-
pail."
“It doesn't take much trouble to imagine all that,” said
Fitzgerald. “You can see it any day in an operetta."
“Well, you know, some prefer the maid with the
milking-pail; while some prefer a woman of the world, with
wit and courage and dexterity, as well as beauty. Don't
let us quarrel. In fact, Fitzgerald,” he said, in a franker
way of speaking, but still with that careless air, “I am
rather in a muddle. Who was it who said “My mind to
me a kingdom is '? My kingdom, I know, sometimes gets

very rebellious--tries to push me off the throne, in fact.
If it doesn't take care, I'll abdicate altogether. And so, to
let matters settle down a little, I am going to retreat for a
while to Dover. I was thinking of running down this
afternoon-
“But the article for to - morrow !” exclaimed his
assistant-editor.
“Oh, you can get something or other-do, like a good
fellow. Print one of your 'Confessions of a Young Man.'
I think they are excellent. It won't be throwing much
away; for you can forward it to a publisher, and ask him
to judge of the bulk by the sample. It will look better in
type. You won't mind sacrificing one of them; and I'll do
as much for you some other time."
This was the last of Hilton Clarke that Fitzgerald saw
for many a day; and after his chief's departure for Dover
he very speedily found that the whole work of editing the
magazine and writing the literary section of it had to be
borne on his own shoulders. Occasionally a few contribu-
tions would be sent up from the Lord Warden hotel; but
they were slight and unimportant. Nevertheless, Fitzgerald
would not admit even to himself that this conduct showed
any want of consideration on the part of his friend and hero.
What if this seclusion were to lead to the production of one
or other of those books that had been vaguely indicated ?
Ought he not to be proud to have the chance of lending a
helping hand in this way? Or—for this suspicion would
crop up from time to time—suppose that Hilton Clarke had
got into some delicate entanglement in London from which
the only sure escape was his prolonged absence from town?
Master Willie worked away as hard as he could; and bore
with equanimity the remonstrances of Mr. Scobell about
the absence of the editor ; and sacrificed not one only but
several of the “Confessions of a Young Man," and tried to
give the best account he could of his circumstances in his
long letters to Kitty.
There was one very serious consideration, however, that
could not be speciously glossed over; he was again almost
penniless. Not even in leaving London had Hilton Clarke
made any reference to money matters ; though by that time

TIO
SHANDON BELLS
he was very considerably in Fitzgerald's debt. For all his
work on the Magazine the latter had received nothing
beyond the ten pounds Hilton Clarke had handed over on
the journey back from Greenwich; and that sum, welcome
as it was, could not be expected to last for ever, even if
Kitty's birthday had not intervened, demanding a little
souvenir. Sovereign after sovereign went, despite the most
rigid economy. Again and again the dire necessity of
having to remind Hilton Clarke of his thoughtlessness arose
before his mind; and again and again he would put that
off for a few days, making sure that Clarke would remember
and write to him of his own accord. He had himself to
blame. It was not a proper arrangement. He ought to
have insisted on being put on some definite footing at the
office, instead of being thus contracted out, as it were.
That Hilton Clarke had drawn the full sum, month by
month, he knew ; for Mr. Silas Earp had casually mentioned
it. It was beyond measure distressing to him to think of
his friend being thus cruelly inconsiderate; but he held his
peace; and went on with his work; and hoped for the
best.
One night he was sitting alone, and perhaps rather
down-hearted, for he had had no letter from Kitty these
two days back, when he heard his Scotch friend ascending
the stairs outside. John Ross had been for some time
absent, sketching up the Thames; and the solitary lodging
in the Fulham Road had been even more solitary since his
departure. Master Willie was glad to hear that brisk
footstep outside.
Then the sharp-eyed little red-haired man came into the
room; and seemed to take in the whole situation at a
glance.
“What's the matter with ye, man? Hard work? The
London air ? Are ye in the dumps about some young
lass?"
“Well,” said Fitzgerald, brightening up, “maybe I have
been working too hard. The magazine isn't a very great
success so far, you know. I have been offering some things
in one or two other quarters; but it's like trying to squecze
through the eye of a needle.”

“Time enough; time enough,” said John Ross. “Your
face is no the right colour."
Then he glanced suspiciously around.
“ Where's your supper," he said abruptly.
Fitzgerald flushed, and said hastily-
“Oh, supper? supper? It isn't nine yet, is it?"
“It's nearer ten. Now, look here, my lad; you come
down the stairs with me, and I'll show ye something. A
fellow has sent me a kippered salmon frae the Solway, and
if ye've never tasted a kippered salmon, then ye dinna ken
how bountiful Providence has been to mortals. Come
away down, man, and I'll brander ye a steak that'll make
your mouth water—to say nothing o' your een, if ye happen
to come across a wee bit lump o' pepper."
He would hear of no excuse; he carried off Fitzgerald ;
went below and lit the gas in the big, gaunt studio; also
the stove ; laid the table; cut a couple of steaks from the
firm, ruddy-brown fish, and put them on the gridiron;
fetched tumblers and bottles; and then, as he stood over
the gridiron, and turned the salmon-steaks with a fork, he
regaled his companion with “Auld Langsyne," one line
whistled, the next sung, with occasionally a bit of a double
shuffle coming in. It was clear that he was in very
excellent spirits, or pretended to be.
• Then when he had popped the frizzling hot steaks on a
plate, and put them on the table, he drew in a couple of
chairs.
“Come away, my boy. Pass the bread. Fitz, my
laddie, I'm going to ask you an impertinent question.
Have ye got any money?".
He affected to be very busy in cutting the loaf, and
fetching a couple of lemons, and so on, so that he should
not see any embarrassment his companion might betray.
“Not very much," was the answer, with a doubtful kind
of laugh.
“I dinna want to borrow. I want ye to tell me if
you've got any, that's all.”
“As I say, I haven't very much.”
“Have ye got any ?" said the other, pertinaciously, and
for a moment fixing his keen eyes on him.

“I've got four shillings,” said Fitzgerald. “It isn't
what you might call a princely fortune; but while I have
it I sha'n't starve."
“Are ye so sure o' that ?” said John Ross, pretending
to be much occupied with the lemon he held. “I'm
thinking ye have been starving yourself. Now I'm flush.
And it's so seldom in my life I've had ower much money,
I'd just like to try the effect o' lending ye à pound
or two. Just think o' the luck! Just tell me this is any-
thing but luck! There am I sitting in front o'the inn one
afternoon, having a pipe, and little else to do. “Landlord,'
says I, “get down your sign, man, and I'll repaint it for you.'
Away the fat old fellow goes, and fetches a ladder, and
down comes the rickety old board. Then soap and water:
and a rub ower with megilp. Man, I took a fancy to the
thing; the sodjer's red coat was fine, and I put in some
trees, beside the inn, and a bit of a glimmer o sunlight
down the road. Ma certes, when it was dry, and hung up
on the iron rod again, it looked fine I can tell ye ! And
that very afternoon—just think of the luck o't !-by comes
a gentleman, and he wants a drink o' meal and water for
his horse, and he begins to ask the landlord about the sign,
and what does the fellow do but ask him to go in and look
at my sketches ?-me away down the river at the time in a
punt. And then the upshot was that he bought two
at £10 apiece; that was £20; and if the half o' that
would be of use to you, ye're welcome to the loan of it,
and may ye live until I ask ye for it.”
Fitzgerald was deeply touched by this kindness on the
part of one who knew almost nothing about him. What,
indeed, could Ross know? It is true, the lad had clear
and honest eyes, that were likely to win the confidence of
a stranger; but it is more probable that this friendly offer
was in great measure the result of that sort of subtle free-
masonry that seems to exist among those who have a
romantic affection for out-of-door sports and sights and
sounds, and who have had opportunities of talking over
these together.
“Are ye proud ?” said John Ross, sharply.
“I don't know how to thank you,” said Fitzgerald,

simply. “I–I think it is tremendously kind of you. I
would take it in a minute if there was need
“How long do ye expect to live on four shillings?”
demanded the other.
But then Fitzgerald proceeded to explain how there
was a very considerable sum of money owing to him, and
how from day to day he had been expecting it, or part
of it.
“Bless me, laddie, ye seem to be clean daft!" Ross
cried. “To go starving yourself deliberately, out o’
sensitiveness for another man's feelings! Let him be as
sensitive about you, to begin with! Nonsense, nonsense,
man; get hold o' the money at once! I would make a
hundred and fifty applications for it before I'd let both
soul and body get down into my boots. The picture ye
were when I went up to your room a while since ! A snuff
for his fine feelings-
“Oh, but you don't know how grateful I ought to be
to this Hilton Clarke," contended Fitzgerald, cheerfully.
“Mind you, I've just been finding out for myself how
difficult it is to get an entrance into London literature.
And you see through him I got employment right at the
beginning- "
"What on earth is the use of employment that ye're no
paid for?"
“ But the money is there. I can have it for the asking."
“In God's name ask for it then !” said his emphatic
companion. “I dinna want to have to attend a funeral.
A nice thing it would be for me to ken ye were just over
my head, lying in a wooden box. No more kippered
salmon for ye then. No more ale for ye—it's pretty clear,
isn't it? No more long letters from a young lass somewhere.
It's no that that's putting ye out ?” he added, with another
sharp glance.
“No, no; there's no trouble there,” said Fitzgerald,
brightly. “Nor indeed anywhere. I will hang on as
long as I can with my four shillings; then, if I don't hear
by that time, I will write. Now we will light up; and you
will let me see the sketches you have brought back from
the Thames."

They lit their pipes. But before fetching the canvases,
Ross stepped over to a dusky recess, and brought back a
brace of wild-duck—both beautifully-plumaged mallard-
and threw them down.
“There,” said he, “that's better than sketches. Take
them with ye, since ye’re bent on starving yourself. Bonnie
birds, aren't they? That shows ye the use o' having a gun
lying beside ye when ye're sketching in a punt.”
“If you'd only bring some whisky with you,” said
Fitzgerald, laughing, “I think I could afford to ask you to
have some dinner with me tomorrow night.”
“But I will," responded his companion, seriously.
“Dinner or supper or what ye like. And the next night as
well, if ye're willin'; I'll see ye have two good meals before
they make a corpse o’ye; and one wild-duck makes a good
enough dinner, an excellent dinner, for two folk. Eh, man,
if I had had a bit spaniel wi’ me! Many's and many's the
time I heard the duck quite close by me in the rushes,
dipping their bills and flapping their wings. Then away
would go the mallard with a whirr like a policeman's rattle;
and then you'd hear the mother quack, quacking to the
brood. Catch her leaving them till she had got them
hidden somewhere! The drake I'm thinking is like the
buck rabbit ; catch a buck rabbit warning anybody, so long
as he can show a clean pair o'heels and a white fud; but
the doe, when ye startle her, down comes her hind legs
on the ground with a whack ye can hear a hundred yards
off, and if the young ones dinna take heed o' that they
deserve what they're likely to get.”
“ Yes—but the sketches ?" suggested Fitzgerald.
His companion had contentedly sat down again.
“Oh ay. I got some work done; I did a good deal
o'work. Did ye ever see a kingfisher fishing ?”.
“No; they're not common with us in the south of
Ireland.”
“Man, I watched one for nearly half an hour last week ;
and the whole o' that time he never stirred a feather. He
was on a stone, or maybe it was a withered stump, under a
bush that was hanging ower the watter. I was beginning
to doubt but that somebody had stuffed him, and put him

there to make a fool o' folk, when snap! down went his
head and neck, and the next second there he was with a
small fish crosswise in his beak. Then he twitched his
head, or maybe he was striking the fish on the stump;
then there was no fish visible; and then a kind o streak
o blue flame went down across the rushes ; that was the
gentleman himself going off in a flash o' glory, as it were.”
"Did you put him in your sketch ?” asked Fitzgerald,
insidiously.
“It's an ungainly kind o' a beast, too,” continued John
Ross, taking no heed of the hint. “Stumpy in shape.
And there are too many colours when he's standing still
like that. But once he's well on the wing you see nothing
but blue-just a flash o’ blue fire, that's fine enough when
it crosses a long, standing clump o' yellow rushes; but
then again when it crosses a dark bit o'shadow it's more
than that; it gives a kind o' metallic jerk that gets beyond
colour a'thegither. I used to sit and watch for them. It
becomes a sort o' fascination; it's like waiting to hear a
pistol-shot when ye see a man aiming."
“I suppose you did a little painting as well while you
were up the river ?" inquired Master Willie, dexterously.
“Pent? Bless the laddie, what did I go there for but
to pent? I pented a signboard to begin wi', which was a
good, honest piece o' work; and I made fifteen sketches
at least; and I came home £ 20 richer than when I went,
just to find a young idjut wearing himself away for want o'
the common necessaries o' life. For that's what it comes
to, my callant; and if ye'll no take the £ 10 I offer ye, I'll
no leave grup o’ye until ye write and get the money that's
your ain.”
And indeed that was what it did come to; for so per-
sistent was the Scotchman, that before he let his companion
go that night, Fitzgerald had definitely promised that the
next day, if no letter arrived for him in the morning, he
would write to Dover, and remind Mr. Hilton Clarke that
even the most willing hack must have its handful of corn.

CHAPTER X.
NEW FRIENDS.
Just at this moment an incident occurred which seemed
slight enough in itself, but which proved to have somewhat
· far-reaching consequences. Among these “ Confessions of
a Young Man” which Fitzgerald had been forced to print
in the Household Magazine for lack of more substantial
material, was a paper entitled “On Murder.” It was
chiefly an essay on the doubts of a young sportsman over
the killing of beautiful and innocent creatures—his com-
punction on seeing them lying on the grass stone-dead
and besmeared with blood, or, worse still, ineffectually
fluttering with broken wing to try to get away from him on
his approach. Or suppose he has wounded one of those
sea-birds that are extraordinarily tenacious of life; and finds
himself forced to murder in cold blood, and with protracted
difficulty, this beautiful, wild-eyed, panting thing? Who
could ever forget the mute glance of a wounded roedeer?
Or fail to be struck with remorse at the piteous squeal of a
kicking and struggling hare? These were the moments of
reflection, of contemplation, that occurred in the eagerness
of pursuit; they were not pleasant — especially to the
sportsman who was alone. But then again the paper went
on to speak of doubts on the other side-doubts whether
it was not possible to cultivate sentiment to an unwhole-
some degree. To live by the taking of life was a universal
law of nature. Animals had to be killed for food; and if
it was objected that the sportsman shot for amusement and
not for the procuring of food, one might ask a rabbit which

117
he preferred, -to be killed outright by a charge of No. 5
shot, even in the way of amusement, or to be snared by
the keeper for the market, strangling for a couple of hours
perhaps with the brass wire getting tighter and tighter.
Then the training and hardihood and skill and health of
the highest of all the animals had to be considered. In
short, the whole essay was a conflict between Mr. W.
Fitzgerald as a hardy, eager, and practised wild-fowl stalker,
and Mr. W. Fitzgerald as a literary person of acute, and
perhaps even poetic, sympathies.
It is just possible that a consciousness of the impossibility
of reconciling these two people had been borne in upon
the writer of the article during its progress; for he wound
up with an appeal ad rem—that is to say, a description of
a day's cliff-shooting in the south of Ireland. How, he
asked, could one be expected to pause and consider such
questions at such a time in such a place ? The Atlantic
thundering on to the rocks below; the steep cliffs ablaze
in the sunlight; the dark mystery of the caves; then a
sudden whirr of half-a-dozen pigeons, the quick snap-shot
right and left (your feet the while steadying you on a ledge
not fourteen inches wide), and then the scramble down to
the beach after the slain. The exhilaration of sky and
ocean and buffeting sea-winds was fatal, he contended, to
metaphysics ; even the still small voice of conscience was
lost in one's anxiety not to slip on the close crisp turf and
go headlong into the seas below. And so forth, and so
forth; however the conflict may have gone in the previous
portions of the essay, it was the pupil of Andy the Hopper
that had the last word.
Well, on the day following the publication of this article,
the following note came to the office :-
“Mrs. Chetwynd presents her compliments to the editor
of the Houschold Magazine, and would be much obliged if
he would kindly acquaint her with the name and address
of the writer of the papers entitled “The Confessions of a
Young Man.'
“Hyde Park Gardens, Monday, 17th."
Now Fitzgerald had had enough experience of the multi-


## p. 118 (#130) ############################################

118
SHANDON BELLS
tude of people who write to newspaper offices on the slight-
est pretext: and he scarcely looked at this note twice. No
doubt, if he sent his name and address, he would receive
in reply a pamphlet by a member of the Anti-Vivisectionist
Society, or an appeal for a subscription to the Home for
Lost Dogs, or some such thing. So he merely sent a polite
reply, in his capacity as assistant-editor, to the effect that
it was a rule of the office not to furnish such information ;
and thought no more of the matter.
However, the next day brought another note.
“DEAR SIR-I respectfully apologise for my intrusion ;
but I think if you knew the circumstances of the case you
would not refuse the request which my aunt made to you
yesterday. She is an old lady, who has met with a great
sorrow; and she has been very much interested in the
series of papers mentioned in her note as recalling to her
something of one who was dear to her. I may say frankly
that she is very desirous of seeing the gentleman who
wrote these papers, if only to thank him for the pleasure
he has given her; and I am sure he would not grudge
giving up a few minutes of his time some afternoon, if you
would have the kindness to forward this request to him.
“I am, dear Sir,
“Your obedient servant,
“MARY CHETWYND.
“Hyde Park Gardens, Tuesday.”
Fitzgerald paid more attention to this note, and even
re-read it carefully—with some little admiration of the
pretty handwriting. No doubt, also, in other circumstances,
he would not have hesitated for a moment to respond to
this simple, frank, and kindly invitation. But the truth
was, at this moment he was in no mood for making new
acquaintances. Not a word or line had come from Dover;
and his four shillings had been reduced to eighteenpence.
Kitty was in Dublin ; her engagement finished; her imme-
diate prospects somewhat uncertain. Moreover, if it came
to that, his clothes were a trifle too shabby for the paying
of afternoon-calls; and so, having written a formal note as
from the editor, informing Miss Chetwynd that her letter

119
had been forwarded to the contributor referred to, he
folded up the sheet of note-paper and laid it aside, con-
sidering the correspondence closed.
Two days after he found among the letters awaiting him
at the office one with the welcome Dover post-mark on it.
He eagerly opened it.
“DEAR FITZGERALD—Don't be in a hurry. I'll make
it all right.
"Yours ever,
“HILTON CLARKE.
“P.S.-I enclose a bit of copy.”
He looked at that for some time, not knowing what to
think. In the midst of his perplexity, Mr. Scobell made his
appearance; and Mr. Scobell was evidently in a very bad
temper.
"I say, Fitzgerald, this won't do at all, you know," said
he, putting his hat down and taking a chair. “I say this
won't do at all. I've stood it long enough.”
“What?" said the assistant-editor, calmly.
“You know very well. I'm not going to put my money
into a thing simply for the amusement of somebody else.
I say it isn't fair ; I don't call it gentlemanly. The maga-
zine is going down every week; I say the circulation is
going down; and it never was much; and it'll soon be
nothing. And all the time I'm paying my money to a
gentleman who amuses himself at Dover! I won't stand
it. It's false pretences. I pay him ; he's my servant;
and he should do his work.”
“But he writes there,” said Fitzgerald. “I have just
this minute got an article in MS. from him.”
“Oh, it's no use trying to humbug mem "
“I beg your pardon, I am not trying to humbug you,"
said Fitzgerald, with an angry colour in his face, “and if
you've got any complaint to make against Hilton Clarke,
you might make it to himself. I'm not responsible for him.”
“No, nobody is responsible ; and the magazine is going
to the devil !” exclaimed Mr. Scobell. “That's just it. I'm
losing money every week ; and nobody is responsible !”.
Master Willie was on the point of saying that precious

120
SHANDON BELLS
little of Mr. Scobell's money had found its way into his
pocket; but he refrained.
“Has Hilton Clarke ever denied his responsibility ?"
said he, somewhat warmly. “It is not necessary for an
editor always to be on the spot. If the magazine is not
succeeding, it is a pity ; but I suppose it was a commercial
speculation, like any other. I consider that Hilton Clarke
has put very good work into it; and his name as editor
was of itself valuable "
“Look here, Fitzgerald,” said Mr. Scobell, in a milder
tone, “I'm not complaining of you. You are doing your
work well enough; and Clarke's too, for the matter of that.
You may stick up for him, if you like; but what I say is
that it isn't fair of him to go and neglect his business. I
pay him. Confound it, I pay him ; he takes my money;
and amuses himself at the Lord Warden hotel! If you
were getting his salary, I could understand your sticking
up for him. And the airs he gives himself. 'Scobell, my
dear fellow!' But he takes my money; and I'm getting
tired of it; and that's the long and the short of it.”
“I don't think,” said Fitzgerald, slowly, as if he wanted
to gain nerve, “I don't think, Mr. Scobell, that if Mr.
Clarke knew you were discontented, he would wish you to
continue the magazine. He would probably ask you to
give it up at once."
“Discontented !” exclaimed Scobell, with a not unna-
tural indignation. “Haven't I a right to be discontented ?
Isn't it losing me money every week ?”
“But that possibility was before you when you started
it,” observed Fitzgerald, respectfully.
“Oh, I don't care about supply and demand and all
that d-d nonsense,” said Mr. Scobell, somewhat inappro-
priately. “Theories don't make the loss of money any the
pleasanter. And I say to myself, Why should I go on
losing money? I never proposed to pay for keeping Hilton
Clarke at the Lord Warden hotel. That wasn't spoken of
when I started the magazine. What do I gain by it? It
isn't even known as my magazine, losing as it is; it's Hilton
Clarke's; it's his name that's connected with it in every-
body's mouth—that is, when anybody speaks of it. But

they don't. They don't even cut the edges of it at my
club. I go into my club, and I ask people about the
articles in it; they don't know anything about them. I
have mentioned it when I have gone into sassiety; no one
has heard of it. What is it to me? What am I paying for?
Why, when I wrote a paragraph about a new brand of
champagne imported by a particular friend of mine, I
couldn't get it printed in my own magazine! I like that!
He struck it out without saying a word'!"
“Oh no; I struck it out,” said Fitzgerald.
“You !” said Mr. Scobell, with an angry glare.
“It was agreed at the very outset that there was to be
no private influence like that brought to bear," said Fitz-
gerald, respectfully but quite coolly. “That kind of thing
is fatal to a paper. A single paragraph that the public
would suspect would ruin it- "
“How far off ruin is it now ?" said the other, scornfully.
“Well,” said Fitzgerald, “I did what I thought was
right; and I don't want to shirk the responsibility. I
know it is what Hilton Clarke would have done ; and I
was acting for him ; and I had no time to ask him first.
But if you are dissatisfied with the magazine as a whole,”
he continued, formally, “or with my share in it, the remedy
is simple, as far as I am concerned. You may consider
my place vacant from this minute.”
He rose. Scobell seemed rather disconcerted for a
second; but immediately he said-
"Sit down, Fitzgerald. Wait a moment. I'm not
blaming you; you've done your best ; you've done all the
work; I wish to goodness we had started with you as
editor, and saved Hilton Clarke's salary.”
“Considering that the idea of the magazine was his ”—
Fitzgerald tried to interpolate; but the proprietor was bent
on mollifying him, and would not be interrupted.
“What's more, though I say it to your face, when I have
heard any one in my own circle speak of the magazine at
all it has been about those papers of yours. Mrs. Chetwynd
spoke to me yesterday. She said she had written to you.
Now that's what I like. I like to be connected with some-
thing that is spoken of among a good set of people. I

SHANDON BELLS
confess to a little weakness that way; I like to be able to
say something about the magazine, and hear it approved
by the best people. And I said you would be delighted to
call."
“I didn't know that was part of my duties," said Fitz-
gerald, somewhat stiffly.
“What?” replied Mr. Scobell, with a stare.
“To go and call on strangers. Why should I call on
Mrs. Chetwynd ? I never heard of her.”
“God bless my soul, never heard of the Chetwynds !"
exclaimed Mr. Scobell. “ There are no better known
people in London. The very best people are glad to know
them. I used to meet Mrs. Chetwynd everywhere in
sassiety until her nephew died. Her husband, you must
have heard of; why, he was deputy-lieutenant of my own
county, before they made him Governor of Tasmania. And
she was one of the Cork Barrys; she was delighted to hear
you were a countryman of hers. Not know the Chetwynds!
But you will be charmed with them, I assure you—I will
take you there myself, if you like !".
Not only, however, did Fitzgerald decline this magnani-
mous offer, but he even hinted that he would much rather
not go and call on these strangers. He was not familiar
with the ways of London life; he was busily occupied; and
so forth. Whereupon Mr. Scobell, who appeared to have
promised Mrs. Chetwynd that she should make the ac-
quaintance of the young man, went on a different tack
altogether, and appealed to his generosity. It appeared
that this poor old lady had recently lost her nephew, in
whom her whole life had been bound up. She had
adopted him as her son ; she had left him in her will every-
thing belonging to her-for his sister, Mary Chetwynd, was
already amply provided for; she had made over to him by
deed of gift a small property in Cork, on the shores of
Bantry Bay. Then a luckless stumble when he was out
riding one day in Windsor Park brought an end to all the
fair hopes of which he was the centre; and since then the
old lady seemed to do nothing but mourn his memory,
while keeping up a strange and keen interest in the various
pursuits he had followed. She knew all the hunting

123
appointments; she read accounts of the new breechloaders ;
she took in the sporting papers. And somehow or other
she had got it into her head that these “Confessions of a
Young Man” were just such essays as would have been
written by this beloved nephew of hers, if he had turned
his mind to literature; for they were continually touching
on the sports and pastimes that he enjoyed. Was it won-
derful that she should wish to see the writer? Was it a
great sacrifice for him to give up ten minutes of an aſter-
noon to please an old woman who had suffered much and
who was near the grave ? The upshot of Mr. Scobell's re-
presentations and entreaties was that Fitzgerald agreed to
call at the house in Hyde Park Gardens on the following
afternoon.
But until then? Well, he had discovered that cocoa-
nut with new bread was an excellent thing with which to
stave off the pangs of hunger, and he had a few coppers
left; while in the evening, on getting down to the Fulham
Road, he took the precaution of putting out the light early,
and slipping off to bed, so that John Ross should not think
he had come home. The worst of it was that this extreme
privation produced deplorable fits of sleeplessness; and as
the brain seems to take a pleasure in painting the gloomiest
possible pictures in the middle of the night, the thing that
haunted him chiefly was the prospect of his having to visit
a pawnbroker's shop. He thought of the man looking at
him; he felt his own self-consciousness tingling in his face;
he wondered whether he should be suspected of being a
thief. No; he could not do that. He could not go into
a pawnbroker's shop. He would go out into the open
streets rather, and offer to sell his boots to the first passer-
by. Besides (this was the cheering thought that came with
the first gray light of the morning) he had still some pence
left; and cocoa-nut and bread was not an expensive meal ;
and who could tell but that Hilton Clarke had at last
taken enough trouble to reckon up what was owing to him,
and had already sent it off?
About four o'clock the next afternoon, Mr. Scobell
called at the office and persuaded Fitzgerald to accompany
him to Hyde Park Gardens. In the brougham, as they

-went abow; but goody had done True, the ociety.
were driving up, he endeavoured to impress his companion
with a sense of the advantages of getting into good society.
It was so important for a young man. True, the Chet-
wynds did not entertain as they had done before the sad
death of the nephew; but good people-people one ought
to know-went about the house. Fitzgerald, who rather
felt himself in the position of a slave being carried off for
exhibition, listened in silence. He had had nothing to eat
since breakfast; perhaps it was that circumstance that
made the prospect of being introduced to “good people"
a somewhat intangible benefit.
However, after all, as it turned out, he was glad he
went, for he was quite delighted with this old lady, whom
he found propped up in an easy-chair by the side of the
tall French window. He forgot all about Mr. Scobell's
pompous patronage of him; he ignored his presence
altogether, indeed, for he was so charmed with this little
dainty white-haired woman, who talked so sweetly, and
with a touch of sadness too, and who moreover had just
the faintest something in her tone that told him that she
too in her youth must have heard the chimes of St. Anne's.
Did he know Bantry, she asked. Why, of course he did !
And Glengariff? Certainly. Bearhaven? He had only
seen that in the distance. Perhaps he had never heard of
Boat of Garry?
She seemed to hesitate a little as she mentioned this
last place; and as Fitzgerald was replying that he had not
heard of it—that, indeed, he did not know much of Bantry
Bay—she was silent for a second or so, and he thought
there was a little moisture in her eyes, and that her mouth
was inclined to be tremulous. But that passed instantly.
The pretty little old lady grew quite cheerful again ; she
said she could see in his writing that he was what the
Bantry people called a "great sporter ;" and wondered
how he could write so much when he seemed to spend all
his life out of doors.
“ That is all over now," said Fitzgerald. “I've sold
myself into slavery."
“And do you find London a lonely place ?"
“Yes, rather."

“But you will soon make plenty of friends. Where
can Mary be, I wonder.”
Just at this moment, as if in answer to her question, the
door was opened, and a young lady came into the room
and went up and shook hands with Mr. Scobell.
"Mr. Fitzgerald,” said the old lady, “let me introduce
you to my niece."
· As he rose he found before him a tall young woman,
who had exceedingly shrewd and clear and yet merry eyes,
a fine face, handsome rather than pretty, and with a good
deal of decision in it. Altogether the first impression
produced on him by this young lady was not entirely sym-
pathetic. He liked gentleness in women. This young
person looked as if she could take very good care of
herself. However, this first impression was modified when
she spoke. She had a soft and musical voice, beautifully
modulated; and she talked with a bright cheerfulness and
frankness that was pleasant to hear. For one thing, he
thought it strange that her dress, which was scrupulously
plain and neat, should not be black, seeing that it was for
her brother that Mrs. Chetwynd appeared to be still in
mourning.
“I suppose auntie has apologised to you, Mr. Fitzgerald,"
said she, “and I ought to also. You must have thought
me terribly intrusive ; but I think our friends have spoilt
us with their kindness of late; and soon I expect to find
auntie printing on her cards of invitation ‘Mrs. Chetwynd
commands the attendance of So-and-so at five o'clock tea
on Tuesday next. Really they are too kind; and but for
that I don't know what my aunt would do, because I have
to be so much out of the house at present."
“How you find time for all you have to do, Mary, I
can't make out,” said the pleasant old lady. “You see,
Mr. Fitzgerald, I get blinder and blinder every day, and
Mary has to be my eyes for me. But this is the worst of
it, that I am a silly old woman, and like to have read to
me nice things. Mary is of the younger generation, and
cares for nothing but science, and education, and teaching
people how many miles it is to the sun, as if there was any
chance of their getting there. It is really too hard on her;

SHANDON BELLS
and I can scarcely read at all now; and the way she
sacrifices her time "
“It isn't my time that is to be considered at all, Mr.
Scobell,” said the young lady, brightly, “but you have no
idea what my aunt will insist on my reading to her. Pretty
stories, and poems of the affections; I do believe nothing
would please her so much as a whole column of the sen-
timental verses-breaking hearts and the rest of it—that
the local poets send to the country newspapers."
“But aren't these interesting enough ?" said Fitzgerald ;
perhaps conscious that he himself had appeared frequently
in that quarter.
“They are a little monotonous, are they not ?" said the
young lady of the clear eyes, regarding him with something
like scrutiny. “A little too much of love and dove, and
posies and roses ?”
“At all events they are human nature,” said he—with
some slight flush in his face. “If they are not merely
literary imitations—if they are the real expression of the
hopes or fancies or feelings of the writers, I cannot imagine
anything more interesting. It is a human life laid bare ;
and that to me is more interesting than a frog's foot or the
question whether there is bismuth in the moon."
She regarded him for a moment curiously. Then she
rose.
“You will excuse me, Mr. Scobell; I have to get to
Whitechapel by half-past five. Good-bye, auntie dear!”
She kissed her aunt; she bowed to Fitzgerald ; and left
the room. Fitzgerald, without knowing why, experienced
a sense of relief.
How pretty this dear little old lady looked sitting in
state there, with the glow of the afternoon lending a faint
colour to the somewhat worn and sad face. Fitzgerald
thought he had never seen such silvery hair. And she
seemed pleased to have visitors; she prattled away about
the things of the hour, and what this or that distinguished
person was doing; and all through, by a chance remark
here or there, she would remind Fitzgerald that she was his
countrywoman. And when they rose to leave, she made a
direct appeal to Master Willie to come and see her again

whenever he had an idle half-hour; for she was an
inquisitive old woman, she said ; and she could not read ;
and she liked to know what was going on.
When they got outside Fitzgerald's admiration broke
forth.
“Well, that is a most delightful old lady!” he exclaimed.
" It is simply delightful to hear her talk. And she seems
to have known everybody worth knowing for the last sixty
years."
“Yes,” said Mr. Scobell, in his lofty manner, as the
footman opened the door of his brougham for him. “Yes.
They are a good sort of people, the Chetwynds. They are
very well known in sassiety. I have a few more calls to
make; ta, ta !"
So Fitzgerald set out to walk home. He had had some
tea and a piece of cake; and that was cheering ; in fact,
it had raised his spirits so much that he now resolved that,
if John Ross were at home, he would frankly ask him for a
share of his supper that evening ; and he knew pretty well
that Ross would be as glad to give it as he to get it. It was
not, however, his supper that chiefly occupied his thoughts
as he walked down to the Fulham Road. More than once
he kept thinking of Mary Chetwynd, and of her manner
towards him, and of what that could possibly be that called
her to Whitechapel.

CHAPTER XI.
A DISCLOSURE.
QUITE clearly matters were approaching a climax. Not-
withstanding all his shifts and devices, Fitzgerald was at
length forced to accept a loan of a few pounds from his
neighbour below; and he at the same time sent an urgent
note to Hilton Clarke representing how his affairs stood.
Of course, he never doubted but that that appeal would be
instantly answered.
Days passed ; there were no tidings of any sort. Finally,
two letters that had been forwarded to the Lord Warden
hotel were returned through the Post Office, with the intima-
tion that Mr. Hilton Clarke had gone away and left no
address.
· Fitzgerald, very much aghast, took these letters to Mr.
Silas Earp. The heavy black-a-vised manager regarded
them in his usually lugubrious way, and merely observed-
“A very good job if we hear no more about him. He
was only drawing his salary, and doing no work.”
“But,” said Fitzgerald, who was rather bewildered,
“but he owes me my salary. I have never had anything
since the magazine was started, except £10!”
“That's a pity," said the other, slowly. “I always
heard he was fishy about money matters - and other
matters, too."
“I don't know what you mean !” said Fitzgerald,
quickly. “Of course he'll pay me. I don't doubt that.
But it's too bad of him to be so careless- "
“I expect he has spent all the money by this time.

Wish I had known; I'd have told you not to have Hilton
Clarke in your debt to the tune of twopence. It's a pity ;
I don't expect you'll ever see a farthing of it."
“You don't mean to say that you accuse him of stealing
my salary ?" said Fitzgerald—but his resentment against
this implication was accompanied by a wild guess at what
his own situation would be if it were true.
“Oh no, I don't say that,” said the manager, regarding
him. “I wouldn't call it that. He wouldn't look at it in
that light. But you ought to know Hilton Clarke better
than I do. I only know of him by report; and I know I
wouldn't lend him a sovereign I couldn't afford to lose.".
Fitzgerald went back to his own room, and sate down.
It was not only the loss of the money-supposing this thing
were true—that troubled him. He could replace that loss
in time. But to think that this friend of his, who had
seemed so kind and considerate, who had such delicate
perceptions and sympathies in literary matters, could act
like a common, vulgar scoundrel, and that in a peculiarly
callous fashion, this it was that crushed him. But only for
a few seconds. He refused to believe such a thing. He
was ashamed of himself for having deemed it possible.
He went back to Mr. Silas Earp, and told him that he
need not mention to any one the fact of Hilton Clarke's
being pecuniarily indebted to him, Fitzgerald, for of course
the matter would be put straight. The lugubrious manager
regarded him, as if with a little sad curiosity, and only said
“Very well.”
The next few days were days of deep suspense to
Fitzgerald, for he knew not what to think of this persistent
silence. When the explanation came, it was short and
decisive. One morning he went into the office as usual.
Mr. Silas Earp met him.
“The fat's in the fire now," said the manager, calmly.
“Mr. Scobell has been here this morning. A mad bull is a
fool to him.”
“What is the matter then ?"
“ The story got all over London last night, he says.
Ind the magazine is to be stopped this week. There is
the announcemer...".

He handed the stupefied assistant-editor a printed slip
with these words underlined in writing—“We have to
announce to our readers this week that the publication of
the Household Magazine ceases with the present number."
“But what is it all about? What is the story ?”.
“Well, I only got bits, he was in such a rage," said the
manager. “It's all about Lady Ipswich, I believe; and
when her brother found her at last at Geneva, with Hilton
Clarke, she wouldn't come back, not a bit. She says Sir
John can sue for a divorce if he likes.”
Fitzgerald was staggered, but only for a moment.
“And even if the story is true,” he cried, "what has that
to do with the magazine ? Why stop the magazine on
account of it? We never advised our readers to run away
with other people's wives ; it has nothing to do with the
magazine !"
“Oh, but Mr. Scobell wants to smash something or
somebody," the manager said, calmly. “His wife is furious ;
Lady Ipswich was a friend of hers. And then there's
money ; Mr. Scobell thinks Hilton Clarke only started this
magazine to get money out of him— "
“Oh, that's nonsense !” said Fitzgerald, warmly.
“That is quite preposterous. Hilton Clarke may be this
or that, but he is not a deliberate swindler. He wouldn't
take the trouble. He is too self-indulgent. And then if
you go and stop the magazine now, you make an associa-
tion between it and this scandal that doesn't exist. You
draw attention to it. You ask people to believe "
But at this moment Mr. Scobell himself made his
appearance; and an angry man he was. It was in vain
that Fitzgerald pointed out to him that to stop the magazine
that very week would be the very thing to make the public
believe there was some connection between it and what had
happened. “ Sassiety," Mr. Scobell declared, was talking
of nothing but this scandal ; and here was Hilton Clarke's
name outside the periodical that he owned ; a nice thing to
have the editor of your own paper run away with the wife
of one of your own friends, and lead everybody to believe
that you had introduced them. He would have no more
of this. He had lost enough money, without having to

aver-
my work on its if it had been personal ses you should drop
incur scandal as well, No doubt it was a fine thing for
literary men to have a paper go on for ever-
“But what do you mean by that ?" said Fitzgerald, with
a sharpness that brought Mr. Scobell to his senses. “If
you are tired of the magazine, and have no faith in it, drop
it when you like; I was only anxious you should not
associate it with a merely personal scandal. But you
needn't talk as if it had been a fine thing for me. For all
my work on it I have received £10; I should have made
more at sweeping a crossing."
Mr. Scobell was bewildered; but when the circumstances
were explained to him, he not only exempted Fitzgerald
from the vague charge he had brought against literary
persons generally, but said he had been infamously treated,
and that as he might suffer from the sudden cessation of
the magazine some compensation was due to him.
“It was plunder—a deliberate scheme for plunder," he
maintained. “And he has done you as he has done me.
It isn't more than three weeks since he got an extra £100
from me; it was a deliberate swindle. He never cared
about the magazine ; he never worked for it; it was a
scheme to get money- "
“It was nothing of the kind, Mr. Scobell,” said Fitz-
gerald, bluntly. “I know what he thought of the magazine.
I talked enough with him about it. He expected it to be
a great property; and that, as he had presented you with
the idea, he ought to have a liberal salary and not too
much work. He is a self-indulgent man; he can deny
himself nothing. If you and I have lost this money, you
can afford to lose it better than I can; but there's no use
in making wild charges. It was not a scheme to defraud;
that is absurd. I think he was very soon disappointed ;
he didn't care to work after that. And then it was a pity
the money should all have been placed in his hands; he
always seemed to think he had a right to everything within
his reach. And then I suppose this opportunity-this
temptation—was too much for him, don't you see "
"Well, you take it pretty quietly,” said Scobell, almost
with a touch of indignation, “seeing you must have lost
£60 or £70 through him.”

SHANDON BELLS
“It wasn't altogether that I was thinking of," said Fitz.
gerald. “I liked him.”
Mr. Scobell adhered to his determination to stop the
magazine ; but he sent Fitzgerald a solatium in the shape
of a cheque for £25. Thus it was that Fitzgerald found
himself with about four or five months' pretty hard work
thrown away, with much less money in his pocket than he had
come to London with, and without that friend on whose occa-
sional word of sympathy or advice he had counted. But
he was not much dismayed, after all. Other people had
come to London and fared worse. He saw lots of things he
thought he could do—driving a hansom, if it came to that.
If his literary adventures had so far been unsuccessful, he
had all the more material in his desk for use when the
opportunity arrived. He was free from debt, for he had
taken instant care to repay John Ross; he could live on
little; he had the hope and courage of three-and-twenty ;
and when he wanted relief from the cares and troubles of
the world he had the faculty of entirely losing himself in a
play or a poem, so that it was of little consequence to him
whether the night was cold, or whether there was supper in
his room or not. Besides, was he not the most fortunate
of mortals in the possession of Kitty? How could a man
be unhappy who had one true heart continually thinking of
him, and cheering him with messages of trust and love and
confidence ?
“MY BRAVE Boy,” Kitty wrote, on hearing of the
catastrophe,—“I'm very glad. It will open your eyes.
It's worth the money. Why, you'll never get on at all if
you believe in everybody like that; and if you don't get
on, what's to become of me? I saw through that whited
sepulchre of a wretch; if I had him here just now I'd let
him know what I've been thinking of him. And even now
you seem disposed to make excuses for him. Perhaps
when one person takes money—and cruelly and meanly takes
money—that belongs to another person, he isn't called a thief
among gentlemen. That wouldn't be refined, perhaps? Now,
dear Willie, once for all, it won't do for you to go on like that.
All your geese are swans (including me). You have too much

people ; and you were made too much of about Inisheen.
If you keep all your poetry for me, and make me wonderful
and glorious, that's quite right-for that is just the sort of
person I am; but you'll have to give up painting fancy
portraits of other people. I am younger than you ; but
I've seen a good lot. But do you think I want my bonny
Coulin to be hard-hearted ? No, I don't. I want him to
keep all his poetry and imagination for me; and not to
believe in anybody else—further than he can see them ;
and then when he has made his way in the world and
fought people on their own terms, then he can settle down
and let his children make a fool of him to their hearts'
content.
“ Willie, there's a man in Dublin bothering me with his
bouquets again; but I don't allow them to be sent up, even
when he manages to get them left, and I haven't even
looked at his card. I go to Belfast on the 13th. My
father can't imagine why I don't go to England; but must
I not remain faithful to my boy's wishes ? Dear Willie, I
have read the verses a hundred times over that you sent
me with the bracelet on my birthday ; but why are they
so sad? I like particularly that one that ends
O aching heart, that sinks or swells
Whene'er at night you hear the sound
So far away of Shandon Bells !'
But are you so very lonely then; and only making believe
to be comfortable and happy when you write to me ?
Really, when I see the people who haven't an ounce or an
atom of your genius driving past in their fine carriages, I
have no patience. And they come to the concert and sit
in the stalls with their diamonds and opera-cloaks; and
the young men so spick and span. Things are not right.
What can they do? Can they do anything but drive in
the Phoenix—the Phaynix I suppose they'd call it. Yes,
and I wonder how long we may have to go on this way,
everything unsettled, and a long distance between us.
And now you have to begin all over again, thanks to your
fine friend. But if you're not afraid, no more am I, and

far away from me, I am lost in admiration of myself).
That reminds me that I have made a conundrum. This
is it— Why should my Coulin be the happiest man in
England ?' Now you may twist this about any way, and
you may pull it to pieces, and put it together again, and
turn it upside down and round about half-a-dozen times
over, and yet you would never find out the answer. I say
you wouldn't, anybody else in the world would see it in a
moment. It's · Because I'm in love with him. I think
this is very good; keep it a secret.

London did not feel quite so lonely that evening,
There was to be an Irish-ballad concert in St. James's Hall
at eight o'clock, and this letter had put him into such a
cheerful frame of mind that he thought he would go away
up there and get some cheap place; and then, sitting all
by himself, and not being obliged to talk to any one, he
would be able to hear if any of them could sing the Irish
songs like Kitty.

CHAPTER XII.
A GO-BETWEEN.
Two days after the public announcement had been made
that there was to be no more of the Household Magazine,
Fitzgerald was sitting in that solitary room of his, alone.
The morning was crisp and clear; there was a wintry
feeling in the air ; the sunlight falling into the little court-
yard was cheerful enough, even if the small plane-trees had
lost their leaves. But it was not of the Fulham Road he
was thinking, now that he had put away from him the
sheet of paper on the table. This first touch of the winter
had awakened dreams. Now the picture before his absent
eyes was Kenyane Head; the blue sea all murmuring ;
the vast caves silent and mysterious; his only companion a
sagacious, quick-eyed spaniel, lying with his nose between
his paws, and yet evidently not understanding why his
master should thus be content to sit and muse, instead of
being up and after the wild-fowl. Again it was a wild
moorland on a bitter cold night; Andy the Hopper and
he each cramped up in a barrel sunk into the bog; both
breathlessly waiting for the sudden whirr overhead of the
duck. Or rather was it not of that wonderful day when
Miss Romayne first condescended to go out into the open
light of the streets with him; his consciousness that all
Cork was looking at and admiring her; the delight of
recommending a particular seat on board the steamer ; the
sail past the golden autumn woods, and the broad shallows
of the river, out into the great, shining, windy Harbour,
with its glancing waves, and white yachts, and islands ; her

admiration of a pretty bareheaded lass at Aghadoe, whose
hair seemed to have been bleached by the sea-air and the
sunlight into different shades of golden-brown, and Kitty's
timid remark that she thought his hair was like that (fol-
lowed by a quick blush, for their acquaintanceship at that
time did not quite justify personal criticism); and then,
finally, his faithful escort of her home in the evening, Miss
Patience most happily being confined to her house with
neuralgia ? Or was it of that other day when, at a later
period of their intimacy, he had inveigled her away into a
boat with him; the Atlantic calm and blue; Kitty getting
her first lessons in rowing, and pulling away so bravely that
by-and-by it was discovered that her poor little white hands
had become quite rosy-red inside ; then fishing off the
deep shelving rocks; her shriek of delight when she felt a
tug; her shriek of fear when he hauled in for her a gasping
and flopping gurnard; their luncheon on the beach, and
the wonder of having Kitty wait on him and offer him
things; then the long row home, Kitty lying snugly in the
stern, and chatting or laughing or singing as the mood
overtook her, the while the westering sun sank slowly
towards the horizon, and the heavens became a blaze of
green, and gold, and crimson fire, and the clear star of the
lighthouse, high up there on the cliff, shone out to sea ?
On this wintry morning his thoughts and dreams were far
away indeed from the Fulham Road.
There was a step on the stair outside.
“John Ross come back from Cookham,” he thought.
But when, in answer to a sharp knock, he went and
opened the door, it was not the Scotch artist but Mr.
Scobell he found before him— Mr. Scobell looking very
smart indeed with his glazed boots, his dog-skin gloves, and
cane.
“ How are you, Fitzgerald ?" said he, and as he entered
the big, bare room he looked curiously around, for this was
his first visit. “Hope you're not busy. Glad to find you
at home. So this is your bunk, is it? Hum, you're not
so well housed as Hilton Clarke was in the Albany. Per-
haps that is because you live on your own money and not
on some one else's,”

"I don'tıld, uneasily very qu
"I don't think there's any use in going back on that,”
said Fitzgerald, uneasily.
“Oh, you take it very quietly—very quietly. Quite
right to stick up for your friend, though ; if you look at it
in that way. That's not quite how I see it.”
He sat down; stretched out his legs; and tapped the
tip of his boot with his cane.
“The fact is," said he, calmly, “I have been trying
these last two or three days to find out how I came to be such
a fool as to go into anything that Hilton Clarke proposed.
But he is a devilish plausible fellow; devilish plausible.
There's a sort of infernal superior air about him that
imposes on people; you can't imagine he'd swindle you— "
“I don't think we need talk about it; for we shan't
agree about it,” said Fitzgerald, bluntly.
“Well, he has made me dance to a pretty tune. Do you
know how much he has got out of me altogether?”
"" You appear to forget,” said Fitzgerald, somewhat
angrily, “that you went into that scheme entirely as a
business matter. It looked promising enough. You had
your eyes open. I suppose if it had been successful ; if it
had made money, and been socially a success, there would
not have been any talking about swindling-
“Very well, very well,” said Mr. Scobell, good-naturedly,
“we will not talk about it. I consider you have more
right to complain than I have. But I did not come here
to talk about Clarke. I came here to talk about you."
He glanced round the apartment; then at the small
table, with its bottle of ink and big sheets of paper.
“I suppose now," said he, with an abstracted dreamy
air, as if he was talking of something a long way off, “I
suppose now it isn't very easy to get on in literature in
London ?”
"I find it difficult enough; in fact I can't get on at
all,” said Fitzgerald ; and then he added, with a kind of
rueful smile : “However, I have not quite despaired yet.
I am trying to find out whether it is my work that is bad,
or whether it is that the newspapers and magazines are
over-manned; or there is this possibility—that my work
may not be so very bad, and yet just miss something that

makes it practicable and suitable. Well, I hope to find
out in time—and the sooner the better for me.”
“Yes, no doubt," observed Mr. Scobell, again assum-
ing that contemplative air. “You have applied to the
Times, I suppose ?"
"No; I imagine every one applies to the Times,"
Fitzgerald said. “And then there is a great drawback; I
don't know shorthand—-".
“You can learn-_"
“I ought to have learnt it long ago. It takes a terrible
time, and constant practice, they say, before you are worth
anything to a newspaper. I ought to have learnt it while
I had a fixed situation in Cork. That was my chance.
Well, I lost my chance, partly, I suppose, because I had
ambitions beyond newspaper work, and partly because I
could get too easily down to my native place, where there
was always a gun or a rod. Now I am paying the penalty;
for the newspapers don't seem to want my fine literature,
and I can't offer them good reporting."
“My dear f’lah," said Mr. Scobell, regarding him with
an air of the most magnificent patronage, “I am delighted
to hear you talk so sensibly-delighted! Sooner or later
the public will listen to you. They will discover that you
can recognise facts. But in the meantime," added this
artful diplomatist, with somewhat greater caution, “in the
meantime, you see, you must make the best of it- "
“No doubt-
“But wait a moment. When I see you in such a
reasonable and sensible way of thinking, I don't think I
can do better than put before you a proposal-a suggestion
— that was made to me yesterday by Mrs. Chetwynd.
Now she is also a person of common sense. She is
practical, and she is also sympathetic. When she saw
the announcement that our magazine had stopped, it
occurred to her that you might have a little more time on
your hands; and she sent for me at once."
“Yes ?" said Fitzgerald ; though he did not quite see
what literary employment he could obtain from Mrs.
Chetwynd.
“To make a long story short—for we had a considerable

talk about you—the sum and substance of her suggestion
is this : that, if you had time to spare from your general
literary work, it might be worth your while to accept some
additional occupation which, with no great trouble, might
-ah-might, in fact, increase your income.”
“I would gladly," said Fitzgerald, without hesitation.
“But it sounds rather-rather vague, doesn't it?".
“Oh no. She had a distinct proposal. If you will read
to her for an hour each day, she would give you a certain
salary—small, you know-but then, an addition, as I sug-
gested-in short, one hundred pounds a year.”
“To read to her ?" said Fitzgerald, with a sudden
flush on his forehead. “Isn't that more like the occupa-
tion of a waiting-maid ?"
“Oh no, certainly not,” said Mr. Scobell, with an
eagerness which showed that he had been looking forward
to this objection. “Not at all, I assure you. That is just
the mistake you make. What Mrs. Chetwynd must have
first of all is an intelligent and cultivated reader, who knows
about politics and literature and what's going on. Very
good people go to her house—the best, indeed ; and she
wants to know what is going on. Very well; the poor old
lady is nearly blind; she can't read; what more natural
than that she should say to herself, "Well, now, if I can find
an intelligent young literary man who could spare me an
hour or so, he could pick out just such things as are im-
portant, and I should have the advantage of his judgment
in literary matters, and it might be some little help to him.'
She is a very kindly and thoughtful old lady, let me tell
you, Fitzgerald ; and before rejecting her offer at once, you
ought to think over it- "
“Oh, I am very much obliged to her, and to you also,”
said Fitzgerald, who was obviously hesitating. “And any
sort of settled income I should be glad to have. But—but
if all this is needed, who has been reading to her hither-
to ?”
“Why, she told you, don't you remember?" said Mr.
Scobell, who perceived that he was likely to be successful
in his commission. “Her niece. But then Miss Chet-
wynd's personal occupations seem to take up more and

more of her time. You have no idea what that girl has
on her hands. And so sharp she is—as sharp as a needle ;
by Jove, she caught me yesterday afternoon as clean as ever
you saw! I said to her, "Well, now, Miss Chetwynd, I
hear a great deal of this Society of yours, and of what you
are doing in the East-end.' 'Oh yes,' she says, 'people
talk of what a few of us are trying to do, and they think it
heroic and interesting and all that, whereas it is quite
prosaic and simple; but what they won't do is to bother
themselves to give us the least help.' Well, don't you
know, my dear f'lah, this was rather a poser; so I said to
her—there were some distinguished people in the room,
mind you, Professor – and Professor — and Canon
- , and a lot more—and I said to her that I wasn't
afraid to go down to Shoreditch or Shadwell or whatever
the blessed place was, and lend a helping hand now and
again. I have plenty of time; I have a little spare cash
now and then; I thought it was natural enough. No; she
wouldn't hear of it; I knew nothing about the people;
indiscreet charity was the worst enemy they had ; and so
on. “Well,' I said to her, like an ass as I was, “you must
be very confident, when you refuse help in that way.' 'Oh,
but I don't,' she says as sharp as a needle. “If you really
wish to help us, you can do so; you can buy us three
hundred filters; we are very badly in want of them.' Three
hundred filters! And then Professor — laughed, as if it
was a great joke; but I can tell you I wasn't going to be
jumped upon by a jackass-headed old idiot like that, so I
said, just as I might be talking to you, 'Of course you shall
have them, Miss Chetwynd.' And now the mischief is I
haven't the slightest notion what they'll cost-five shillings,
half a sovereign, a couple of guineas- "
“Oh, they are not so dear as that,” said Fitzgerald.
“ That one over there is a very good little filter, and it
only cost me half-a-crown.”
“Half-a-crown. Thirty-seven pounds ten. Well, if it
had been a hundred and thirty-seven pounds ten I declare
I'd have paid it to take the wind out of the sails of that
lantern-jawed old Behemoth. But about this matter of the
reading, Fitzgerald. I did not undertake that you would

dred a year isn't much— ".
“It is a great deal to me,” said Fitzgerald, frankly.
“Very well. What is an hour's time a day? And
there's more than that. The very best people in London
go to that house. A young man ought to see sassiety. I
think it is a great chance— ".
“Oh, but I can't go at all if I am to see any one !” ex-
claimed Fitzgerald, in great dismay. “I did not understand
that at all — "
“Of course you won't see them while you're there on
duty—of course not. But surely you understand. This
old lady is interested in you. She is a countrywoman of
yours. Something in your manner, or accent, or something
in your writing, reminds her of her nephew, who was just the
· whole world to her. And of course you will be recognised
as a friendly visitor, not as a slave. You may meet people;
my dear f’lah, it is a great chance for you! It is one of
the very best houses in London; and it is not exclusive-
Cabinet ministers, men of science, poets, painters, all sorts,
as well as the best known members of the fashionable
world. There is no house in London is more highly
spoken of. My dear f'lah, you must be mad if you think
twice !"
“Well, I won't think twice."
“That's right. And I said if you accepted you would
call on her this evening at six: all the visitors will have
gone by that time.”
Accordingly, that evening, Fitzgerald called at the house
in Hyde Park Gardens; and was immediately admitted
and shown up to the drawing-room. Instead, however, of
finding Mrs. Chetwynd there, he found her niece, who was
seated at a table apparently engaged in painting, and who
rose as he entered. He was disturbed and vexed, he
knew not why. He did not like meeting those clear and
penetrating eyes, though indeed they were pretty eyes, and
had some touch of friendliness in them as she spoke to him
and said she would go and fetch her aunt. It seemed to
him that he was taking over a woman's work; while she
herself was addressing herself to the harder outside realities

of the world. That was not a pleasant thought—especially
if it had also occurred to her. He was somewhat relieved
when the tall clear-eyed young lady, whose natural grace of
manner somewhat softened the serious simplicity and dig-
nity of her face and figure, left the room. Nay, he re-
joiced to think that he had caught her painting. That was
something pretty and feminine. As there was a complete
silence outside the door he ventured to approach the table
where she had been seated, to get a glimpse of her work.
And then he found that instead of colouring Christmas
cards, or finishing up a little bit of imaginary landscape,
she had been engaged in copying on to a magic-lantern
slide, from a scientific book lying open there, the appearance
of a magnified drop of impure water, with the most ghastly
creatures squirming about within the charmed circle. He
had just time to retreat a step or two when aunt and niece
entered.
The little old lady received him in the most gracious
way, and begged him to be seated, while her niece was
making her comfortable in an easy-chair by the fire. That
accomplished, Miss Chetwynd took up her painting mate-
rials and disappeared.
“I hope I have not disturbed your niece,” said Fitz-
gerald, anxiously, “by calling at this hour.”
"Oh dear no !" the old lady said, warming her
mittened hands at the fire. "Oh dear no. I daresay
she is off to her magic-lantern now. She means to frighten
some of her poor people into using filters; and your friend
Mr. Scobell, by the way, is going to get her the filters.
She is a very good girl, is Mary; and very industrious; I
only hope she won't catch some dreadful fever in those
places. But don't talk to her, Mr. Fitzgerald, if you please,
about her work. She says there is too much talk. Oh, by
the way, perhaps I am going too fast in assuming that you
are going to take pity on a poor old blind woman, and let
her know what's going on ?"
“If I can,” said he, “but I scarcely know ".
“Oh, but you shall have absolutė liberty," she said,
blithely. “You shall order any books or newspapers that
you like yourself; and I am looking forward to such a

treat; for I have had to live for so long on the dry bones
of science! You know, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mary is the best
of girls; but she can't help thinking that I am interested
in what interests her; and really, as you said so cleverly
the other day, one gets weary of the frog's foot and would
prefer a little human nature. And Mary laughs at me for
a silly old woman when I have listened most patiently to
her Post-Office Savings Banks scheme, and her plan for
ventilating sick-rooms, and all about her hospital-nurses,
and when I say to her, ‘Mary, dear, just to go in to dinner
with a pleasanter taste in the mouth, won't you read me a
chapter of Consuelo ?' And really it is wonderful what
that girl gets through in a day; learning herself and
teaching other people; and afraid of no amount of trouble
or disappointment. Oh yes ; and I can see that her
reading is not thrown away: for sometimes, when the
scientifics, as I call them, are here, though she does not
say much, you can hear that she has just hit the point in
dispute ; and they are all very kind to her, I'm sure.
Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, I am so glad that this has been
arranged; and I hope we shall try to make it not very
irksome to you. What hour would suit you best?"
“But that is for you, Mrs. Chetwynd, to say," answered
the young man. “Any hour, indeed, would suit me; for
I have no definite occupation at the moment, since the
Household Magazine was stopped."
“A quarter to six in the evening would suit me very
well, then,” said the old lady. “For at this time of the
year we keep open table—a quarter to seven table d'hôte in
fact, without any ceremony, and anybody who likes can
drop in, and then be off to their lectures and what not.
That is very useful for Mary; she sees everybody; and
has not got to sacrifice the whole evening. Well, you see,
Mr. Fitzgerald, if you could make it convenient to call at a
quarter to six, and spend an hour with the newspapers or
new books, I should go in to meet my friends quite
coached up, and then I shouldn't have to ask them whether
Queen Anne was dead or not. And I know you'll have pity
on me, Mr. Fitzgerald ; and not choose books that are too
dreadfully learned. We will leave the bismuth in the

moon alone, even if you have to read me the broken.
hearted poems in the provincial newspapers.”
And so, with a very pretty little laugh, and an appoint-
ment for the very next evening, this interview was
concluded; and Fitzgerald, as he walked away down
through the gas-lit streets to Fulham, was thinking that this
time there could be no mistake, that this time he could
definitely assure Kitty that he was in possession of a
settled income, however small. And there were other
things that occurred to him. He could not help regarding
it as one of the oddest possible results of the conditions
of modern society that he, a man, should have been
constituted, as it were, the champion of sentiment as
against science, and that his antagonist, the champion of
science, should prove to be a young lady of very con-
siderable personal attractions. The situation seemed to
him novel; and he kept wondering what Mary Chetwynd
thought of it, if, indeed, she had time to think of such
trivial things at all.

CHAPTER XIII.
NEIGHBOURS.
To be a man of letters in London how many young
people, in remote corners of the country, are at this present
moment thinking that there can be nothing finer than that,
and perhaps secretly wondering whether they might not
risk the venture and try to make such a career their own.
When Fitzgerald resolved to quit the security of that
provincial newspaper office and try his fortune in the great
capital, he was fairly equipped for the enterprise. His
education, if not extensive, had been thorough as far as it
went; he was well read; he had taken immense pains in
mastering a certain simplicity of style ; he was familiar with
many subjects and ways of life that the ordinary writer,
inostly a dweller in towns, knows very little about; he had
youth, health, and a frank face; and his heart was fired
with love, which was likely to add a little touch of poetical
glamour to his productions. But his experiences fell far
short of his buoyant hopes. His ignorance of shorthand
barred the familiar gateway of the newspapers. Then he
found that those magazines which were the most ready to
accept his contributions were the least prompt in paying for
them. Moreover, he had sadly to confess to himself that
those contributions which he could get accepted were not
literature at all. They were mere manufacture-compila-
tions in the British Museum. At first he had aimed at
something higher. Disregarding Hilton Clarke's disparage-
ment of criticism, he had made some careful studies of one
or two of the pre-Shakspearian dramatists : no editor would

bok at them. Then he tried essays on social and
domestic subjects ; but every avenue seemed to be
blocked. Occasionally he had the satisfaction of finding
a bit of translation from Catullus or Horace accepted;
though he rightly judged that magazine editors looked on
such things as handy for filling up half a page. No, there
was no help for it; he might cultivate the higher literature
for his own satisfaction, but if he wanted to supplement
that one hundred pounds a year he was now in receipt of,
and so be able to write hopeful letters to Kitty, what he
had to sit down and compose was a useful little paper on
“The Successive Discoveries of Kaolin” or “The Origin
of the English Race horse," or some such practical subject
It was not literature; but it brought Kitty a little
nearer.
John Ross was doing him a mischief. It was all very
well for the Scotch artist to take this young companion of
his about with him, and give him a new pair of eyes, and
colour up the world for him ; but unconsciously to himself
Fitzgerald was adopting in his own work Ross's way of
looking at things. Ross was purely and simply an
impressionist; a vivid suggestion was what he aimed at,
careless of subsequent detail or even precise accuracy of
form. And it was so delightful to Fitzgerald to walk
abroad with this man, and see the commonest things in
the world intensified with a new interest, that he insensibly
yielded to the fascination and forgot that he was a writer
and not a painter. The objects of life became to him so
many pieces of colour ; when he looked at a long terrace
of buildings shining clear on a summer's day, it was not to
guess at the rent of the houses, or wonder whether they
were well drained, or whether there were any sick people
there unable to come out into the sunlight, but to observe
that the warm brilliant mass of yellow made the blue above
more intense. If the life of a man of letters in London,
so far as he had experience of it, was disappointing and
prosaic, these occasional walks with his artist companion
brought back some poetry into the world. “ Anch' io son
pittore," he might have said, so wonderfully did his faculty
of observation develop under this rough-and-ready,

quarrelsome, enthusiastic tutelage ; but he was much too
wise to attempt anything with the brush.
“Man,” said John Ross to him one day, as they were
walking out in the suburbs, “what a grand thing it must be
to be like you !"
“Oh, indeed," said Master Willie, whose fortunes did
not seem to himself to be so flourishing.
“Ay, just to be able to look at the things that nature
puts before ye, and never to have a thocht o' how ye're
going to make money out o' them. What wouldna I give
to be a laddie again, just for an hour, and lie down on a
warm bank in the sun, and watch the clear waters of the
burnie twirlin' round the stanes, and the speedwells on the
banks, and the red rowans on the trees, and everything like
that, and just to let your eyes drink it in without even
thinking of the infernal pent-box. Man, it's a terrible
thing to have to go through the world just conteenually
warslin wi' tubes o' colours. There's no two things
that I see thegither that I havena to take the balance
of; it's a disease; confound it, it's a disease ; I'm a man;
why shouldna I be allowed to go through the world and
look at it like another man? It's a pent-box that's the
millstone round my neck. Why should I care about they
palings ?” he said, as they were passing a cabbage garden.
“I'm not going to pent them! What is it to me what
colour they are!'
“Well, that can't bother you anyway,” said Fitzgerald,
with a laugh, "for they haven't any colour." .
"Dinna be so sure about that, laddie,” said the other.
“Ye think they're gray, I suppose.”
"Well, aren't they ?"
“ Oh ay. No doubt, if ye took a bit o' the wood in
your hand, ye would find it gray and colourless enough.
But just you try to fix your eyes on the wooden paling and
on the violent greens o' the cabbages at the same time. Is
the wood quite so gray ?”.
"No," Fitzgerald had to admit. “Not quite so gray.
In fact, rather lilac, isn't it? In fact, it is quite a pinkish
lilac, if you look at the two together.”
“Ay, and that's what ye've got to paint, my laddie.

But if people 'll no buy my pictures of Cookham, they're no
likely to buy a picture of a cabbage gairden in Chelsea.”
“But after all, Ross," said his companion, “writing
people are just as badly off as painting people; for they
have to keep watching and watching— "
. “But they havena to warsle wi' pigments, man !” the
other said, impatiently. “When ye see a thing is yellow, ye
say it's yellow, and there's an end; but the painter has got to
get that particular quality out o' an infernal tin tube, and
even then put it into all sorts o' relations with the things
round it. I wish to heaven I had been brought up a
painter of shop-doors and shutters, and I could have had
my own way wi' fine colour and naething stepping in to
spoil it."
“It's all nonsense your complaining like that,” Fitzgerald
said finally. “Instead of complaining, you ought to be
thankful. The difference between you and other people is
that you have trained yourself to see more. You see
beautiful things at every turn, where they see nothing. Is
there any advantage in being partially blind ?"
Had John Ross kept more closely to his studio in the
Fulham Road no doubt Fitzgerald's life at this time would
have been a pleasanter one. But he was much away,
especially when he had got a few pounds for a sketch, and
his neighbour, up there in the solitary room, felt the winter
nights to be long and dark. The hour spent in reading and
talking to Mrs. Chetwynd was the bright spot of the day;
when he returned to his lonely lodgings and this almost
hopeless manufacture of articles in which he took nothing
but the most perfunctory interest, sometimes the world
seemed to weigh heavily on him. But curiously enough, it
was always at such moments, when circumstances seemed
to hem him in, when the battle of life appeared to be going
against him, when the future seemed growing dark indeed,
that his imagination broke through these toils and carried
him into a sphere of creation where his work was a joy to
him. No matter how insignificant the result might be, it
was the expression of something within him that he himself
could not well understand; it was not of the slightest
consequence to him what editors might think of it. Onę

Sudden en knowuld; but is trying, and he had
night, for example, he was labouring away at an article on
“Some particulars of the Earthquake at Lisbon.” He had
been for two days at the British Museum ; and he had
copious notes before him. He was trying to make the
picture as graphic as he could; but it was distressing work ;
and he did not even know where to send it when he had it
finished. Suddenly he heard a slight hissing sound in the
fire— like that produced by rain falling down the short
chimney. But he could hear no sound of rain on the
slates. He went to the window; there was an absolute
silence; but there were dark streaks crossing the orange
glow of the lamp in the courtyard. He opened the window,
and put out his hand : it was stung by the sharp, moist
touch of snow. And then what must he needs do but
hastily put on his cap, and issue out into the dark to feel
this soft thing blowing all about him—touching his lips, his
eyelashes, his hands—this soft, silent thing that made a
wonder of the lonely streets. He wandered on and on in
a sort of ecstasy ; voices seemed calling to him from the
past : he knew not whether to laugh or cry. His blood
tingled with joy at the presence of this new, strange thing;
and yet there was a kind of despair as if he yearned for
some one far away; and there was a doom portending ; an
agony of love and terror and appeal. Then a phrase here
or there, and it was a lover who spoke ; and the voice of
the sea could be heard now, in the awful caves. Quite
blindly, like one in a dream, and not heeding the snow, he
made his way back from the dark lanes to his room, and
almost mechanically he sate down to his writing-table. He
saw something before him not the least like what he had seen
outside. It was more like the sea; and darkness; and the
wild Irish coast. And with an impatient cast here and
there for a rhyme, and all trembling, and even scarcely
knowing quite the value of the phrases he was using, he put
down on paper what seemed to him the voice of some one
else, that he could hear far off in the night-
The wild March winds are blowing ;
The trees are dark; the skies are gray;
O love, let us be going—
The evening gathers : far the way.

O do you hear the thunder
On Daramona's rocky isle-
The wild seas sweeping under
The ghostly cliffs of black Glengyle ?
He rose, with a quick kind of sigh ; pushed the paper
away, and began mechanically to knock the snow from his
sleeves and his coat. Then he went to the fire; and lit a
pipe; and stared into the red coals as if he expected to see
more pictures there. And then, after a time, he went back
to the table ; and took up the bit of paper; and calmly
and critically regarded what he had written.
“Yes," he said to himself. “That's it. That's true.
I will keep that for myself. There isn't an editor in London
would give me twopence for it anyway; and the public
would ask where the story was; but it has got to stand just
as it is; it is a bit of my personal property for Kitty to
inherit when she becomes a widow."
Just as he was putting away the bit of paper into a desk
which contained a very considerable quantity of similarly
useless scraps, a noise was heard below; and Fitzgerald's
heart jumped up at the notion that perhaps John Ross had
come back from Sonning, where he had been for a fort-
night. There was a ready means of ascertaining. He took
the poker and knocked twice on the floor. In response,
there were three knocks on the roof of the studio. Then
Fitzgerald made his way down the slippery steps; and
caught Ross as he was in the act of lighting the stove.
“No, no; let that alone,” he cried. “I've got a blazing
fire in my bunk. Come along up. Man, I've got some
sheep's tongues that'll make your mouth water; and a yard
of French bread; only you must bring some whisky with
you. Come along ; I want to hear all about Sonning, and
I won't ask you to show me your sketches.”
“Ye're in a cheerfu' frame of mind, laddie,” said Ross,
looking up. “Have you been drinkin'?".
“No; what's worse, I've been neither eating nor drink
ing, and I'm desperately hungry."
“ And so am I. Have you got any tobacco ?”
“ Plenty."
“Wait a minute then."

He went and got a cloth and dusted the snow off the
packages he had brought in; and then he followed Fitz-
gerald up the staircase; and was soon engaged in helping
him to lay the cloth of the supper-table and open the
bottles and what not.
“But I want to ken what has put ye in such fine fettle,
man,” he said, at length, regarding his companion from
across the table. “Some young lass in Ireland, I suppose,
has been sending ye a true-love knot. Poor thing! a lassie
should never let her sweetheart get so far away as this; it's
no safe."
“It isn't that though. I've written something I am
pleased with ; something I am going to keep for myself,”
said Fitzgerald, frankly.
“ Let us see it, then."
“Oh no. It wouldn't please any one else, I know.”
" Then what is the use of it ?”
« None.”
“And ye are going on amusing yourself with capers
instead of getting money and furnishing a house for the
lass : is that what you mean?” said the other severely.
“What lass ? What are you talking about?”.
“I have my suspicions, my lad. But let's see what
this is."
“Oh, very well,” said Fitzgerald, at once going and
fetching the sheet of scrawled paper.
John Ross bent his brows, and proceeded to read the
verses line by line, which was an exquisite piece of torture
for the writer of them.
“Where is Daramona ?” said he, abruptly.
"I don't know.”
When he had finished, he looked at it carefully again,
and said, in rather a peevish sort of way-
“Well, but have ye nothing more to tell us ?"
“No."
“It's a ghastly picture enough ; oh ay, I admit that ;
but—but what is it about?"
"I told you you wouldn't be pleased with it,” said
Fitzgerald, without any resentment.
“Ye might make some story-

“Oh yes, I know quite well. I know what an editor
would want. There would have to be a third verse with
two dead bodies washed up by the sea somewhere; or some
definite thing like that. Well, I am not going to patch it
up for sale. I am going to keep it as it is—of no* use to
any one but the owner.”
John Ross was not satisfied. He looked at the verses
again, and then grumbled-
“ It's a good suggestion—it's a capital suggestion-but
why dinna ye follow it out?”.
“Some people,” said Master Willie, slyly, "might hint
that about some of your sketches; and yet you won't alter
them.”
“God bless me!" cried the other, staring at him. “Has
the laddie gone daft? Writin' is not pentin', man! Do
ye think the public are going to take the trouble to make a
story for themselves ?”.
“I don't mean to ask them,” said Fitzgerald, simply.
“That is only a little bit for my own private satisfaction.
Won't you allow me as much as that? I don't find that
eager competition among editors and publishers for my
work that I should like. I think the world could get on
without literary people—especially literary beginners."
But he himself seemed to detect some kind of false note
in this—some echo of what Hilton Clarke might have said.
So he added, frankly-
“No, I'm not going to give in yet. And I have got
hold of a subject that I think might do."
“What is't?” said his companion, filling his pipe. “No
too big, I hope. Something practical ?”
“Well, you know, when you were up the Thames, my
suppers here were a little bit lonely," Fitzgerald proceeded
to say, as he also drew in a chair to the fire. “And I
discovered that you could get a plate of cold meat, or a bit
of fowl, and a glass of ale, at the Green Man, for sixpence.
That again entitled you to go into the parlour and have a
smoke. I went in, and made a discovery. There are
cronies who come there, every evening, and discuss the
affairs of the nation. My goodness! I have heard extra-
ordinary statements made in the smoking-rooms of inns;

but never anythirrg quite so fine. And of course, as a
stranger, I had to sit quiet and listen; but what I was
thinking was that there must be a large population in this
country who get their ideas and information from sources
that the governing classes don't know anything about.
What are they, then ? Not the ordinary daily papers ;
for I read them. And this isn't the only bar-parlour or
smoking-room I've been in; and it seemed to me that a
series of articles on public-house politics might really be of
use. These men have votes.”
“Ay, the sources of their information, did ye say ?*'
said Ross, grimly. “Their own heads, maybe?”.
“But then," urged Fitzgerald, “when you hear a man
make the absurdest statement—about the Prime Minister
having written so-and-so to the Pope—and when he declares
he saw the letter in print, and when everybody accepts the
statement, you begin to ask how such stories can gain
currency "
“The impudence o' the one man, and the ignorance o'
the ithers, I should think,” said Ross.
“No, for these things are talked of as matters of common
knowledge ; and yet the ordinary organs of public opinion
know nothing of them-indeed, they are quite preposterous.
You know, my father keeps an inn. I did not go much
into the smoking-room ; but I heard things from time to
time; and you wouldn't believe the stories that are com-
monly accepted about the Royal Family, the members of
the Government, the House of Lords, and so on- ”
“ Ye're right there," Ross said. “I would not believe
them.”
. “The old gentlemen who meet at the Green Man are
very loyal at all events,” Fitzgerald continued. “Will you
corne round to-morrow night and listen to them? Oh no;
you'd better not; they don't talk over respectfully about
Scotchmen.”
“I'll come round wi' ye, laddie, if ye like; but what I
want to know is how ye're going to get any bread and butter
out o' writing down the idiotcy of a lot of bemuddled auld
beer-drinkers.”
“But they have votes !" contested Fitzgerald. “And

there are thousands and thousands of them throughout the
country; and their opinions spread; and surely it is of
importance to know what they are saying. If it is absurd,
if it is ludicrous, so much the better for me. I don't see
why a solemn discussion on the only fit and proper way to
govern Frenchmen, by these profound students of history,
should not be made amusing enough."
“Oh, that's it, is it? Ye go and get admitted into a
brotherhood o' philosophers, and ye watch and wait, and
then when they are warmed into friendship and confidence
wi' their pipes and their ale, and when their poor wandering
old wits begin to dance and stagger about a bit, then ye
begin your thumb-nail sketches—you, sittin' in the corner.
Why, man, it's like making a fool o' your fayther."
“I think it's a very good thing," said Fitzgerald, with a
laugh, “that the one half of the world should know what
the other half are saying."
“Get away wi'ye,” said Ross, resentfully. “Do ye
mean to tell me ye will give a fair and honest report ? Do
ye mean to tell me there will be anything but gibes and
jeers and gross misrepresentations? And you, a laddie
just out o' school, to make fun o' men o' mature years, who
have pondered over the course o' the world's ways, and
learnt the lessons of life from A B C to X Y Z! That
is a nice work to undertake! Fathers of families, with the
work o' the day over, and maybe glad to get away for an
hour from a scolding wife, and doing their best for their
country in talking over public affairs, and enjoying a quiet
glass in warmth and security; and to have this Mephisto-
pheles there wi' his note-book
“If you were to come with me for a night or two,” said
Fitzgerald, “you might make a few sketches. There are
some splendid heads—of the regular old John Bull type,
with a churchwarden added. Then we could make a book
of the reprinted articles, with your sketches of the people."
His companion glanced at him.
“Your brain is quick, laddie, for new projects.".
“But that's what they come to," said Master Willie,
indicating, somewhat sadly, his open desk. “They are all
nicely tied up there in wrappers, and addressed to myself.”

“There's a mine o' wealth in that desk, man,” said Ross,
sharply. “When I am an Academeecian, and you are the
editor of a daily newspaper, we'll both find out the value o'
they sketches in that desk there, and in my studio below.
Have I no told ye that already until I'm tired? Ye are in
too great a hurry, man. Some day ye'll be glad enough to
get hold o' these ideas that ye are flinging about ye now.”
“Some day !" echoed Fitzgerald. “But in the mean-
time?"
“In the meantime," said he, rising and putting on his
big cloak and his cap, “I'm going down below to my bed.
And in the meantime begin your Teniers sketches, and
good luck to ye; and dinna fash yourself about what's

there's a young lass in the case, as I jalouse, tell her no to

the door and looked out, “ I'm glad there's no moor to

“TO MY TRUSTY AND WELL-BELOVED Coulin, THESE : It is
quite true, my dear Willie, that my letters to you have been
very short lately; but you have no idea how I have been
bothered and worried in coming to terms about that other
tour in the south, and then I have had to try and pacify
papa. He has taken it into his head that he ought to know
more about you and our “prospects.' Isn't that a horrid
word ? It is like 'matrimony,' or nuptial settlements,' or
something in a lawyer's office. I tell him that we are not
going to do anything rash; that I for one am quite content
to be as I am ; and when he writes long letters about the
importance of being settled in life and the possibility of his
not being long in the world, what can I do but gently remind
him that I have earned my own living for a good many
years, and have no great fear of being unable to do so?
Poor dear papa, he is very kind, but he worries dreadfully.
And really I don't know what to say to him. If you were
still the sub-editor of that poor defunct magazine, that
would be something definite. Shall I tell him you are
private secretary to a great lady? Of course, I too wish
you had something more settled : but do not imagine, dear
Willie, that I am grumbling; for after all are we not just as
well off in every respect as we were before we ever saw
each other, and why should we not be quite content with
things as they are? I hate writing like this. It is like
drawing out a marriage-contract. If you were just here for
two minutes—I can imagine your coming in at the door

over there, and looking round to see that Miss Patience was
not in the room—we should understand each other at once.
And if you were at the open door now, do you think I
would be long at this table? Don't you think I might
meet you half-way, even if the ink-bottle were to be sent
spinning across the floor? And you to talk of the coldness
of my letters !
“Besides all that worry, I have been hard at work with
Professor — ; and fancy the difficulty of doing that by
correspondence! He sets me the most terrible tasks; and
as it is all science and no sound it is not very lively. But
really when you look at some of the songs that are most
popular now in drawing-rooms — the air some common
phrase, or perhaps borrowed, and of course changing to
minor in the second part, and the accompaniment a few
simple chords, only fit for children's practising—it seems
possible for one to do something a little better. And then
shouldn't I like to be able to set one of your songs to
music-I mean something like proper music; I think I
should not grumble over studying the counterpoint of that
accompaniment. Do you think I would charge my Coulin a
heavy royalty for singing that song? There, now : why don't
you gentlemen of the press set to work and crush that royalty
system? It is most mischievous; and the very best singers
are giving in to it now, and of course the greater stupid the
composer is, the more eager is he to make the royalty on the
sales big. Then the public are stupid, and don't remember
that a good singer can make even the singing of scales pathetic;
and any kind of song sounds as if it were fine if a good
singer takes trouble with it. But you are not interested. I
can see you are very nearly throwing my poor letter in the
fire. But supposing that I put it this way, that A (this sounds
like the Professor, but I'm not going to teach you harmony),
who can sing a little, marries B, who is very fond of singing
and music generally. Then they grow older; or A's voice
gives out; is there to be no more music? On the contrary,
A having been a good little girl, and having devoted a fearful
amount of time to the study of music and to practising, can
still play B to sleep after dinner. More than that, if they
get into trouble, can she not give music-lessons ? I believe

this is a clear case of Q. E. D.: is it not, Master
Willie ?
“But everything in this letter is pure nonsense, and not
to be heeded, except the tremendous fact that in ten days I
shall be in Cork again! think of it 1—the very same rooms,
too; and the same old piano; and the same little iron gate
outside, which used to give such a queer rusty growl and
squeak as a sort of friendly good-night to Master Willie, and a
hint to come early the next morning, if there were any blue-
bells and campions to be looked for out in the woods.
Alas! there will be no blue-bells or anything else now—mud,
I suppose; and I shall sit at the rainy window, and not stir out
until it is time to go away down into the smoky town. There
will be nobody there now to make all the place wild and ro-
mantic; and to stuff people's heads full of dreams; and to
make a poor girl think she never saw anything so lovely as a
street in Cork, when it was pouring wet—and the rain from
the umbrella all the time running down her left shoulder and
arm, because her companion was so careless. And there
won't be anybody to say nice things about her in the Cork
Chronicle ; or to walk home with her up the steep hill; or to
stop and talk just for a minute or a half-hour or so at the
little gate. And what is Inisheen like now?-I suppose the
sea dashing all over the shore ; the villas shut up; the town
a puddle. Sure 'tis not to Inisheen that I'm going! The
only comfort would be that the ghosts and pixies of the
neighbourhood would have gone. What do the fairies do
when it is wet ? It must be most uncomfortable up in that
glen, with all the branches dripping and no leaves on the
trees, and everything damp and cold and miserable. I
never heard of fairies in winter.
“But about Inisheen, dear Willie, seriously. I wish you
would let me know a little more clearly about that promise
you made me give you. I have heard that in Scotland if
two people only say before other people that they are man
and wife, that is enough, and they are married! I have
never been to Scotland, and I don't know; but I should
think people might be too quick and then repent. I want
to know if the promise we made that night (wasn't it a
beautiful night too !) is anything more than a promise? I

have been wondering whether it might be the way young
people used to get married when their parents were against
it, or the priests perhaps. Situated as we are, sometimes I
think it was scarcely wise to bind ourselves like that—and
then again I say “Bother these doubts and troubles ; it's all
because Professor — 's conundrums are too difficult.'
And I am not going to bother you with them, dear Willie; for
you must have enough to think of; and I meant this to be
the longest and kindest letter ever written after what you said
about my not caring. I do care. You have no right to say
that I don't-and if you were here I would prove it, even to
your satisfaction. There now. So don't say another word
about not caring; but write me a long, nice, pleasant letter,
professing yourself quite contented with everything that
Providence and I have done for you, and telling me all the
news of what you are doing, and how you occupy your time,
and whether you ever think of poor banished me. You are
very ungrateful; you have not the slightest notion of how
good I am to you—to be sitting up writing to you like this,
when every sensible creature in Belfast is in bed. The
fire has gone out; and the room is dreadfully cold ; yet
here am I writing away with stiff fingers, and the difficulty
is to know how to stop. For I do want you to believe that
I did not mean my letters to be cold ; I think it was the
weather that got into them; and if you wait till a thaw
comes, and read them over again, you will find them quite
different. This is all at present from
“Your loving KITTY.
"P.S.—Miss Patience is very kind to me just now.
She wrote a letter, which she showed me, to the Northern
Whig here the other day, about the numbers of beggars in
the streets; and as sure as ever was, the very next morning
there was an article in the newspaper beginning 'From the
number of letters which we receive complaining of the
prevalence of mendicity in this town,' etc. Oh my! At
first she was so lofty she would scarcely speak to me, for
she considers me a frivolous kind of creature, but afterwards
she grew more gracious, and has been quite compassionately
kind to me ever since. Last night she made me wear her

gloves on the way home, for I had forgotten mine, and it
was cold. She even said that your verses in Chambers's
Journal, which I showed her, were written with much taste,
though she added that she thought this was scarcely a time
for writing poetry, considering the serious state of public
affairs. Never mind, Willie; there is one person at least
who knows better than that; and you need not be afraid
that she does not appreciate your poetry, as the world will
some day.
“Good-night, good-night !--K.”
Many and many a time did Master Willie read over this
letter, wondering to which to attach the more importance
— the obvious outward cheerfulness, or the curious half-
suggested little admissions of trouble and doubt. He was
so anxious that Kitty should not be anxious! And it was
hard on Kitty to be away in those towns, practically alone
—for that fool of a creature who was supposed to be her
companion, apparently lived only for the pestering of editors
—and not hearing very definite news of her lover's success.
The space that separated them seemed great enough; but
it was the thought of the time that might separate them
that he was afraid would weigh on Kitty's spirits. And so,
in answering her, he resolved to take no notice of these
involuntary backslidings of hers; but to assume that she
still had the hope and high courage that possessed her
when he and she parted at Inisheen.
“MY DARLING KITTY," he wrote,_“You are all wrong
about Inisheen. It is far more beautiful now than in the
summer ; this is the time it is worth living in—not when
idle and fashionable young ladies come down to the little
villas and show off their finery along the sands, neglecting
their music, and becoming impertinent to their companions.
You should see the real Inisheen when the frosty sun shines
red through the thin fog; and you get a touch of crimson
on the shallow waters of the harbour; and the heavy craft
are lying high and dry on the yellow ooze. Just now, my
dear Kitty, you would find the sun setting behind the sea,
not away up behind the land, and the cliffs looking splendid.
Then at night--think of the moonlight on the frost-hardened

moor, with the ice-ponds quite silvery here and there ; that
is the time for the duck, I can tell you. You think the
people are depressed now? Why, this is the sociable time
of the year; when you come home stiff with cold to a
blazing fire and a warm room; and then you get your
dinner over, and people come in, and you have the whiskey
put on the table (that's for you, Miss Kitty, not for me) and
the kettle steaming on the fire, and then the jokes and
stories begin. Then you want to know where the fairies go
to in the winter? I can tell you all about that. Mind
you, the glen you speak of is quite lovely just now, with red
berries and dark green bramble-stems, and lots of colour
you don't find at all in the monotonous summer green ; but
that does not matter; for I confess that the fairies at this
time do spend the most of their time feasting and singing
and dancing in the great halls within the mountains, though
they have scouts sent out from time to time to see what is
going on. There was a great banquet given by Don Fierna
on the night of Tuesday last in the hall that comes nearest
to the hillside above the well that you know. It was a very
splendid affair ; the vast cavern was all lit up by millions of
glow-worms placed along the rocks; but besides that there
were innumerable will-o'-the-wisps moving through the air, so
that you could see all the colours of the various costumes
quite well, although most of the light fell on the long
banquet-board, and that again lit up the smiling faces of
the ladies and their knights. At the head of the long table
Don Fierna sate in state; a terrible, huge person, nearly
two feet in height, with a prodigious black moustache and
heavy eyebrows; he wore a Spanish hat of black velvet, a
scarlet cloak, and on his breast hung his thick gold chain
of office, all glittering with precious stones. On his right
sate the boy-king of the fairies (who is his heir-apparent),
but he was a very beautiful little king, with large blue eyes
and golden hair, and he wore a cloak of purple velvet
clasped at the neck with gold, and also a crown of pure
gold starred with sapphires. Opposite him—that is on Don
Fierna's left-sate the boy-king's bride ; she was more like
a fairy than any of them ; she was so slight and fair and
delicate ; and she wore a cloak of cream-white velvet, which

had a scarlet flower where that was clasped, and her crown
was not of gold, but of pure silver with scarlet berries set
into it. The other knights and ladies were in all sorts of
different costumes and colours ; and so were the servitors,
who were hurrying this way and that, with the materials of
the feast. Oh, did I tell you that in the distance you could
hear nightingales ? For this is where the nightingales retire
to in the winter ; but they would be too noisy; so they are
shut up in an adjoining cave, and you can only hear their
singing like a sort of continuous waterfall. Well, you know,
Kitty, I need not tell you all the things they had at the
banquet ; for the menu was rather long; only this, that the
wine they drank was made of the honey that you get in the
heads of pink clover, and that whereas the lords and the
ladies drank out of acorn-cups, Don Fierna's flagon con-
sisted of the shell of a plover's egg set in a handle of bog-
oak. Well, when they had got down to the end of the list,
Don Fierna rose ; and the moment they saw him rise, each
lord and lady struck a small silver gong in front of them,
so that instantly there was a sort of soft tingling music
rising from the whole table and filling the cave; and this
immediately hushed the servitors to silence.
“Your Majesties, my noble lords and gracious ladies,'
said Don Fierna, 'before we proceed to the dance, I have
a question to ask. What is the name of the mortal who
was last at the Well of Vows ?
“All the eyes of the assemblage were now turned to the
lower end of the cavern, where near the immense gate, and
half-hidden in the dusk, was a rather tall soldier-looking
fairy, dressed entirely in blue, with a blue feather in his cap,
and a long silver sword by his side.
“Catherine, my liege,' he said. (It's a curious fact,
Kitty, but the fairies always call mortals by their Christian
names. I don't know why it is; perhaps it is in imitation
of the Church; or perhaps they found that human beings
were always changing their surname.)
"Say, where is this Catherine ?' Don Fierna con-
tinued—and you could hear his voice through the whole
place, though he did not speak so loudly either. But
everybody was listening intently.

6. In the north, my liege. It is understood she is
coming to your Highness's city of Cork.'
“She has been observed ?'
66. Assuredly, my liege.'
"She remains faithful to her vow?'
“At this all the ladies lowered their eyes, and looked at
each other, wondering.
“She does, my liege.'
“ The words were pronounced with emphasis ; and no
sooner were they heard than the whole assemblage once
more struck the little silver gongs, and it was as if the
hollows of the cavern overhead were all filled with the
singing of birds.
"Your Majesties, my lords and ladies,' said Don
Fierna, we may despatch this piece of business before the
revels begin. This faithful one must be rewarded. When
she comes to our royal city of Cork, you will assure to
her sweet sleep, sweet dreams. You will instruct your
attendants. You will banish from her idle fears; you will
guard her from the phantoms of the night; the dark and
sleep shall be as sweet to her as the day
“With that all down the table there was a continuous
“Yes,' 'Yes,' 'Yes, so that the sound was just like the
wind in summer stirring through the beech-trees. Don
Fierna then gave his hand to the young queen in white
velvet; and the king her sweetheart turned to the noble
dame who was next him; and so the whole company went
away two and two down the great hall (but leaving enough
space between the couples for the ladies' trains to be fairly
seen). And then, when the lords and ladies had disappeared
into the ballroom, the servitors, in their green jackets
and gray hose, forthwith jumped into the chairs of their
masters and mistresses; and there was such a noise of
laughing and feasting that the very nightingales could no
longer make themselves heard.
“And so you see, my dear Kitty, that so far from having
anything to fear from Don Fierna and the fairies and the
elves of Inisheen, they really have you under their protec-
tion; and it is not the least use your worrying about what
you promised at the well, and imagining dark things, for

indeed, promise or no promise, the result will be quite the
same. Only, it seems to me, it would be base ingratitude
on our part for all the kindness of the invisible world of
Don Fierna if we were not to make that pilgrimage. And
only once in seven years too! Dear Kitty, think what a
trip that will be! Of course, in married life, if what every
one says is true, and if we should prove to be only like
other people, one's views of things must naturally get
changed; and no doubt the romance of love may get
a little tempered down by familiarity and custom; and you
cannot have such a lot of things to talk over as two people
who only meet from time to time and have all their future
to settle. But just think what a reopening of the past that
will be to us two; how we shall seem to see ourselves
again standing there as we were seven years before; and if
we have had our quarrels or misunderstandings, surely that
will be the place to make everything up. My darling,
don't look on your promise of that night as something
terrible, something to haunt you; but rather as a bit of
romance added to the facts of your life-something that
you can recall in after days with a kind of smile, perhaps,
but yet with a tender smile, and something that will remind
you through possibly more prosaic years of what you and I
were thinking of once. Is not that sensible, Sweet eyes ?
“ About your father; you must let him understand, my
darling, that I am quite as anxious as he can be that I
should have something definite and settled; but Rome was
not built in a day; and if you and I are content to wait
for a while, I suppose that is our own business. Do you
know, Kitty, that you are very profuse in your assurances
that you are content with things as they are. I am not;
not at all. I try to imagine what our life will be when we
are together; and of course that makes me very impatient
when I find another stumbling-block in my way. However,
there is no reason for grumbling. Plenty of people have
come to London to try to earn a living, and been worse
served than I have been. I have one hundred pounds a
year certain ; I have nearly all my time my own; and I
am writing so much and offering it in so many quarters
that I must in time find out what the newspapers and
nearly fiering it the newsp

magazines would wish to have, or what it is they object to.
Mind you, I have my own ideals; and when the chance
serves, I work at them; but in this absolute fight for life, I
have got to make just such bricks as the builder will buy.
Some day, Kitty—when you and I can plan things together
-after the fight is over, and we have won the fortress-
then I shall be able to work in my own way, careless of
everybody, and who knows but that one might then strike
for honest fame'? I shall look in your eyes; the old days
at Inisheen will come back; that will be inspiration
enough.
“In the meantime, dear Kitty, if I can't tell you of
anything definite and settled as regards my literary work,
this at least will please you. I have been thinking over a
series of papers describing the nonsense that is talked
about politics and political men in tavern parlours and the
like-some of it being exquisitely absurd ; and I wrote one
paper and sent it to the Hyde Park Journal. To my
astonishment (and a little bit of delight) it appears in this
evening's edition ; and I send you a copy, though it won't
interest you much. Now the Hyde Park is a very good
paper; and if they will only continue the series, it will be
an excellent thing for me, for the varieties of human folly,
especially public-house politics folly, are endless. So you
see things are not so bad ; and you are a good girl to be
working so hard—so good that I am not going to talk any
more to you about wretched newspapers and my scribbling,
and hopes and disappointments. Don't forget that I love
you. I shall be glad to hear of your being in Cork, for
then Don Fierna will have his little scouts looking after you
and protecting you. Do not forget that I love you."

CHAPTER XV.
A SYMPOSIUM.
But if Fitzgerald's efforts to obtain a footing in literature
had so far been productive mostly of disappointment, he
was very clearly succeeding in another direction. Mrs.
Chetwynd made no secret of her interest in, and wish to
befriend, this young man who seemed to her to resemble
in many ways the nephew whom she had lost; and the
good old lady, with much tact and delicacy, hinted that he
himself might make the suggestion when any opportunity
offered. It is not improbable that, if Fitzgerald had asked
her for funds wherewith to start another magazine, she
would have consented; but he had had enough of such
experiments.
In the meantime he strove to make his duties as little
of a sinecure as was possible. To his own great delight
he had absolute carte blanche as regarded the ordering of
new books or reviews; and he diligently read the one and
glanced over the other, so as to let his patroness know
what was going on. But when it actually came to the
imparting of this information, the chances were that the
little old lady would begin by asking him something
about his own affairs, and that not unfrequently led to a
mere gossip about the south of Ireland. Once or twice,
indeed, she inadvertently called him “Frank;" and then
apologised for the mistake, with a quiet tear or two. On
another occasion, when he was about to leave, she happened
to hear the rain beating heavily against the window.
“Oh, but you must not go out in such a shower, Mr.
must not g against the c, she happenen

Fitzgerald,” she said. “Or you might ask Saunders to get
you a waterproof.”
. Indeed, she herself rang, and—with a little hesitation,
which Fitzgerald understood perfectly—told the man where
he would find the coat. Fitzgerald thanked her, of course;
and went out, and down into the hall. But something, he
scarcely knew what, forbade his making use of this water-
proof.
“Whose is it?" he said to the footman who brought it
to him.
" It was Mr. Frank's, sir.”
He had guessed as much.
“Oh, thank you," he said, rather absently. “I don't
think I shall need it. I have not very far to go.”
But if Fitzgerald was slow to avail himself, on his own
account, of those hinted offers which the kind old lady had
made him, it occurred to him that he might do something
for his friend John Ross. Mrs. Chetwynd had heard a
good deal about the Scotch artist in Fitzgerald's descriptions
of their conjoint occupations and country walks; and at last.
she said she would like to see some of his work.
"I do not promise to buy any," said the old lady, with
her pleasant smile, " for there is scarcely any place we could
put them."
Indeed the house was pretty well filled with the ordinary
pictorial adornments of an English dwelling_little pieces
of Dutch genre in heavy old-fashioned frames ; gloomy
landscapes a long way after Salvator Rosa; one or two
imitations of Wilkie ; and a large number of historical
engravings, glorious in incident, but less satisfactory in
draughtsmanship.
“ Besides," added Mrs. Chetwynd, “ Mary would accuse
me of extravagance, so long as I disapprove of her spending
her money on a nine-inch telescope."
“A nine-inch telescope?” said Fitzgerald, in surprise-
for he had understood that Miss Chetwynd was a young
lady of considerable fortune. “Surely that cannot amount
to much ?”
“So I thought,” said the old lady, laughing," when I
heard of it at first. But it appears that the nine inches

refer to the diameter of the glass; and I am told the thing
looks more like a thirty-two pounder. And then she
spends so much of her money on these wretched people of
hers. Well, it is her own, poor thing. I think I must let
her have her way. She shall have the window in her room
altered ; and she shall have her thirty-two pounder; and
then I will buy some of your friend's pictures.”
“Oh, but I could not have you buy them on my
recommendation,” said Fitzgerald, in some alarm. “That
would never do. You must have some skilled advice—I
don't know enough about pictures- "
“But according to your account, they are just the very
paintings to suit a blind old woman,” she said brightly.
“I shall see nothing of them but their colour, which you
say is so good— ”
“But—but I would ask you to have some one else's
judgment, Mrs. Chetwynd,” said he, earnestly. “Of course,
I think them good; I don't see how the work of a man
who studies as hard as he does, and who can talk so ably
about it, can be anything else. But if you will allow me,
I will bring up a few of his sketches; and you might ask
some one who is a good judge
“ As for that, there will be no difficulty,” she said,
promptly. “We know several of the Academicians. It is
not unusual for one or other of them to drop in to dinner
and have a chat with the scientifics."
“Academicians ?" said Fitzgerald, uneasily. “Not very
old ones ?”
She named one or two.
“Oh," said he, gladly, “ any one of these would do. I
am not afraid of them.”
But this conversation had results for himself as well as
for his friend. Fitzgerald was in the habit of leaving a
minute or two before a quarter to seven, which was the
hour for Mrs. Chetwynd's table d'hôte, as she called it; and
even then he sometimes encountered in the hall a guest
who had strolled in before the proper time. But this talk
about Ross's pictures had made him forgetful; and he was
just about to ask his patroness some further question as to what
kind of landscape she preferred, when a gong sounded below.

A SYMPOSIUM

“ Goodness gracious me !” exclaimed the old lady.
“ There is dinner ; and Mary has not come back from
South Kensington! Mr. Fitzgerald, will you kindly give
me your arm downstairs—I am so blind now; and the
people will be coming in, and nobody to receive them !"
But at this very moment, Miss Chetwynd made her
appearance-a trifle breathless, for she had run upstairs.
“Come away, auntie !” she said, cheerfully, as she
hastily took off her bonnet and cloak and threw them
on a chair. “But why don't you ever persuade Mr.
Fitzgerald to stay to dinner ? I know he dislikes scientific
people ”
It is needless to say that this invitation was warmly
seconded ; and Fitzgerald, who was quite aware of the
informal nature of this nightly table d'hôte, and who, perhaps,
had some little curiosity to see in the flesh one or other of
the celebrated people that Mrs. Chetwynd talked so much
about, very gratefully and modestly accepted. He did not
even make a pretence of refusing. Mary Chetwynd's
proposal had been made so simply and frankly, that he met
it with equal frankness. He walked into the dining-room
after the two ladies, with much calmness; and this time he
had nothing to fear about evening dress.
There were three gentlemen in the room. One was
away in a corner, examining, through a double eye-glass
that he held in his hand, one of the engravings on the
walls; the other two were standing on the hearth-rug, their
backs to the fire. The taller of these was a long, thin,
cadaverous man, who stooped a little ; he had piercing
gray eyes under shaggy eyebrows; and very white teeth
which showed when he laughed his prodigious laugh; him
Fitzgerald recognised at once, having seen his photograph
often enough, as a Dr. Bude. The other he did not know;
but he thought it very cool of both these gentlemen to take
the entrance of the two ladies with so much indifference.
They finished what they had been talking, or rather laugh-
ing about; then they came forward and shook hands; and
then sat down as it pleased them at the table. But this
indifference was unintentional; for very soon, when some
other guests had come in, and everybody had sat down, and

dinner had begun, it was very clear that Dr. Bude was
amongst the foremost to amuse and entertain his hostess.
And it must be confessed that there was very little science
talked amongst this nondescript gathering of friends and
acquaintances. There was a good deal of joking, it is true,
when it became known that Mary Chetwynd was to be
allowed to have her big telescope ; but for the most part
the talk was all about public characters, and what So-and-
so had said, and where So-and-so was staying. These
scientific gentlemen seemed to know a good deal about
the comparative merits of certain country-houses as places
of temporary lodgment; and their talk about fish-ponds,
and cooking, and the advantages of having a well-heated
hall in the middle of a house, was not so very much raised,
after all, above the level of Mr. Scobell. Master Willie
had more than once wondered what figure Mr. Scobell
would cut in this familiar little assemblage of great people;
but indeed their conversation was not of an extremely
serious nature.
He sat next to Dr. Bude; and, as Dr. Bude was engaged
in describing, with tremendous laughter, to Mrs. Chetwynd,
a conversation he had had with a gentleman whom he had
met at a City dinner, Fitzgerald had plenty of leisure to
study the rest of the guests, and also his hostess's niece.
He had had no such opportunity before. He had scarcely
ever seen Miss Chetwynd. She was mostly engaged in the
East of London; when she was in the house, she was
occupied in her own room. And now it seemed to him
that her expression was a little more gentle, less resolute
and self-sufficient, than he had fancied it was. The head
was small; and beautifully shaped ; and she wore her hair
more tightly brushed than was the fashion of the time, so
that the symmetry of the head was clearly seen. Her
features were fine; her complexion somewhat pale; and
now he saw that her eyes, which hitherto he had considered
to be somewhat cold in their clear, direct way of looking at
one, were really of a beautiful blue, with dark lashes, and
could be expressive enough, whether she seemed interested
in what her neighbour was saying, or was joining in some
general merriment. And when she had to submit to some

raillery about the forthcoming big telescope, she did it very
prettily.
“You know," she said, “the time will come when
people will look back on Lord Rosse’s telescope as a mere
toy."
“Why, of course,” said Dr. Bude, coming to her rescue.
“You are quite right, Miss Chetwynd. The human race
will be driven to invent not only immense telescopes, but
also means of conveying themselves to some other planet
that is, when this one grows too cold for human subsist-
ence. When the earth cools, and the process is going on
now, so that humanity must flit, you may depend on it by
that time science will have invented means for their removal
to a more generous climate. But there must be a begin-
ning in the way of experiment. I appeal to Professor
Sims. The Royal Society should do something."
Professor Sims, who was the shorter of the two strangers
whom Fitzgerald had found standing before the fire, and
who was a white-haired, rosy-faced old gentleman, with gold
spectacles, answered immediately—
“No doubt, no doubt,” said he. “The necessity must
arise. And if you look at what science has done within
the last ten years, who is to say what she may not have
accomplished within the next—what whall I say?"
". An eternity or two,' was Alfred de Musset's phrase,"
suggested Fitzgerald : but it instantly occurred to him that
to mention even the name of a sentimentalist like Alfred
de Musset among these hard-headed people was absurd.
However, it did not much matter; for presently they were
considering whether, when the world had got chilled down
to the condition of the moon, the last traces of human
occupation would be the Pyramids or the Colosseum.
Some one suggested the buried cities of Mexico; and so
the matter dropped.
The dinner was a plain one as compared with the
banquet which Hilton Clarke had given in the Albany;
and Fitzgerald observed that the majority of the gentlemen
present drank no wine, or, at most, a little claret and
water. Indeed, the whole of the proceedings were some-
what abnormal; for, directly the frugal repast was over,

coffee and cigarettes were produced, and the ladies remained.
Then one or another of the guests would get up, and, with-
out any formal apology, shake hands with Mrs. Chetwynd
and her niece, and say “Good-night !” or “Au revoir," or
perhaps nothing at all, to the others, and be off.
“I must be off, too, directly,” said Dr. Bude to Fitz-
gerald. “I have some people coming to look at a few
simple experiments with the spectroscope; and I must go
and see that my battery is ready. Will you come? I can
show you a nine-inch telescope, since that seems to interest
you. Wiil you come ?"
“Oh, certainly; I shall be delighted," said Fitzgerald,
with great eagerness. This Dr. Bude had been very kind
in one or two little things he had said during dinner. He
knew about the Household Magazine. He knew about
Fitzgerald's present duties. He seemed a friendly sort of
person; and the mere invitation was a compliment coming
from one so well known.
The only doubt in Fitzgerald's mind was as to the
propriety of his going away while any of the others remained.
He had no lecture to deliver ; nor any learned society to
attend. Moreover, there did not seem much chance of his
explaining the circumstances to Mrs. Chetwynd; for the
pretty old lady— who seemed so pleased that all these
people should drop in to chat with her for an hour -- was
listening intently to the gentleman on her left; and he was
describing the very remarkable high jinks he had observed in
a great person's house immediately after dinner—the ladies,
indeed, taking part in them; and he was warmly defending
these on hygienic principles : although hoping that nothing
about them would get into the papers, through some
unfortunate accident happening. However, Dr. Bude got
him out of the dilemma; for he rose and said —
“Good-night, Mrs. Chetwynd. I must be off to get
my things ready; and I am going to take Mr. Fitzgerald
with me, to show him what a nine-inch telescope is like."
He went out of the room without saying good-bye to
anybody else, Fitzgerald following; and the latter, in a
minute or so, found himself, for the first time in his life, in
a private hansom-a vehicle which went so smoothly and

so rapidly that he seemed to be going through the air on
wings.
Dr. Bude's house was in the Brompton Road—a rather
shabby - looking building outside, but spacious within.
Fitzgerald followed his host up to the first floor, the back
part of which consisted of an apartment that seemed partly
an observatory, partly a library, and partly a laboratory.
An assistant was at the moment arranging some glass
tubes, and two spectroscopes, on a table ; and Dr. Bude,
throwing off his coat, though the dusky room was far from
being over warm, proceeded to test the various wires and
other apparatus, all of which were a profound mystery to
his guest.
“I suppose you see a great deal of Miss Chetwynd ?"
he said : and at the same moment the electric light flashed
into a tube, causing Fitzgerald's eyes to jump.
“Oh no, very little.”
“She's a very remarkable woman," said the other, with
decision : though, indeed, he was now on his knees on the
floor, examining the battery. “She might do something,
that girl. She has a fine brain-acute and penetrating.
But she has had no training, that is the mischief of it.
She should have been brought up on mathematics. But,
after all, the number of women who have done anything in
pure science is very small. I think she is throwing herself
away on this education of the poorest classes — that is
vestrymen's work; though perhaps I should not say so;
for I don't know precisely what she is at.”
Then he rose ; and clapped his hands together, to get
rid of the dust.
"I was amused,” he said, with a laugh. “She asked me
what would be the most effectual way of teaching these
ignorant people the perniciousness of breathing foul air.
You know how they huddle together for warmth; and
cover the children over with such bed-clothes as they have
got. I think she was going to deliver a lecture on ‘Fresh
Air and Pure Water' somewhere or other "
“Yes, I know she has done that,” said Fitzgerald, as
the tall, lean man turned towards the table again, and
continued his preparations.

“Well, she very naturally concluded that tumbling gases
of different weights into jars, or extinguishing tapers, would
not be impressive enough : so I told her to get a sparrow,
to tie its feet down to a bit of board ; and to put over it a
bell-jar before these people, and ask them to watch what
will happen to the bird merely through its breathing its
own breath. Of course the little creature becomes
asphyxiated, staggers and falls, and ultimately dies. Doubt-
less, I told her, the most effective way of exhibiting the
experiment would be to raise the bell-jar during the
process of asphyxiation, and show the reviving effect of the
fresh air ; then to close it again until death preached its
moral. She said she would do that. She was quite
delighted. What lesson could be more obvious ? "
But at this moment there was a sound of footsteps on
the stairs; and the Doctor had to whip on his coat, and
go and receive two or three young people who now entered.
Fitzgerald did not like that story about the sparrow. Miss
Chetwynd was no Lesbia, clearly. And although the con-
science of a wild - fowl shooter is apt to be hard ; and
although he knew quite well that the asphyxiation of a
sparrow or even twenty dozen sparrows was scarcely to be
considered if it induced a certain number of human beings
to treat their children more humanely-still-still-
The Doctor came back.
“I have a sort of class,” he explained to Fitzgerald,
"who come and practise a little and ask questions, before
the vulgar world arrives to be amused. I hope it won't be
tedious for you. If you prefer it, my assistant will
arrange the telescope for you ; the night is beautifully
clear-
“Oh no, not at all. Was Miss Chetwynd's experiment
successful ?”
“Why I forgot to finish my story! She got the sparrow,
and the string, and the board, and the bell-jar, all complete;
and she thought, to make sure, she would make her first
trial before her aunt in the drawing-room. And it was all
quite successful until the first stagger of the little creature ;
then she hesitated; then she shook her head. Off came
the bell-jar at once; she opened the window; and cut the

string; and out went Jack Sparrow. Nothing would induce
her to repeat the experiment.”
"I should not have thought she was so sentimental,”
said Fitzgerald.
“Ah, that's just it," said the Doctor, as he heated a bit
of copper-wire at a gas jet. “A woman never ceases to
be a woman, whatever she is at. Her reason fails her
when she is confronted by suffering; her heart overmasters
her head. But in pure science that girl might have done
something, if she had had proper training. She has a fine
quality of brain. I can tell how much people know by
their questions. Her questions are always sharp and to
the point. When she comes here she knows precisely what
she wants— "
The good Doctor seemed to like talking about Mary
Chetwynd; but on this occasion he was checked by the
appearance of the young lady herself, who arrived quite
alone. She seemed surprised to find Fitzgerald there,
though she said nothing beyond an ordinary greeting. She
at once went forward to the table; and the Doctor was
particular in finding her a chair, though the others who
were now arriving were allowed to stand about anyhow.
What followed was quite unintelligible to Fitzgerald, for
at that time the theory of spectroscopy was much less
familiar to the public than it is nowadays, when every
second schoolgirl has a spectroscope in her pocket. But
if the meaning of the experiments was dark to him, the
manners of the students were interesting enough; and he
could readily distinguish between the serious ones, who
were mostly silent, or only asking a question now and again,
and the flippant ones, who exclaimed with terror at the
ghastly appearance of each other's faces when a little com-
mon salt was ignited at a Bunsen burner, and who cried,
“Oh, how sweetly lovely!” when a trifle of chloride of
lithium spread abroad a rose-red flame. But perhaps it
was the demeanour of Mary Chetwynd that most engaged
his attention; and he could see that her questions were the
most promptly answered, and that to her most of the ex-
planations were addressed. Fitzgerald, standing apart by
the mantelpiece, and observing, out of that motley group,

SHANDON BELLS
only these two—the long, lean, pale-faced teacher, and the
young lady student, who sat in a chair there, following his
words with a serious attention-began to dream dreams.
Why should not these two cold intelligences go through the
world together, like twin stars sailing through the night?
He was considerably her elder, to be sure; but the girl who
was sitting there, with the fine, serious, thoughtful face, was
more likely to think of his high reputation than of his years.
What a strange love-making it would be! Moonlit walks
with disquisitions on the spectrum of Sirius. The Bunsen
burner looked ghostly enough; but he knew that Don
Fierna and the elves would fly away from it. He could
scarcely help laughing when he thought of these two tall
persons standing on each side of the little stream, and hold-
ing each other's hand. What would the phrase be? “Over
HO, in rapid motion ?" And then he thought of Kitty.
Kitty did not know, probably, that water consisted of
hydrogen and oxygen; but Kitty knew how to make love.
He sent her a kiss in imagination. By this time of the
night she would be at home-away up there on the hill,
opposite Shandon Bells.
These speculations about the possible future of Dr. Bude
and Miss Mary Chetwynd were somewhat rudely dispelled
by the entrance of a stout and comely dame in rustling
black silk, who cheerfully greeted the various pupils, and
kissed Miss Chetwynd very affectionately, and then, address-
ing the lecturer as “My dear," asked him for certain keys.
The next minute Fitzgerald was introduced to this buxom
and good-humoured-looking lady, who turned out to be
Mrs. Bude; so that he had to bid good-bye to that horo-
scope of the scientific lovers. Mrs. Bude did not remain
long; she was evidently in a hurry; Fitzgerald returned to
the contemplative study of the heads before him, as these
were illumined from time to time by the various colours of
different metals.
Something else was going forward, however, on this first
floor. The drawing-room, with which this observatory was
connected, had been brilliantly lit up; and now steps could
be heard on the stairs outside, and the names of guests
being announced as they reached the door. Then some of

177
these began to stroll from the drawing-room into the obser-
vatory; and very soon the Doctor was busy enough, with
greeting these new-comers, and with trying to show them
something they could understand. His patience and good-
humour seemed to Fitzgerald admirable. “Oh, what a
lovely green !” “Oh, how sweetly pretty !” “Must I shut
one eye to look through ?" "Doctor, why should one line
be so much clearer than the others ?” “And so you know
that all these things are in the sun ?” “Do show my
husband that pretty green colour again !” The good
Doctor appeared to be talking to all these ladies and
- gentlemen at once; sometimes frankly laughing at their
questions; and not at all displeased that he should be
addressed as if he were the conductor of a show. Fitzgerald
could perceive that Miss Chetwynd was calmly regarding
the new-comers; once or twice he caught her smiling to
herself.
Amid the crowd of people, who kept strolling in from
the large and well-lit drawing-room to the small and dusty
laboratory, and strolling back again, there was one lady who
very much interested him, partly because she was remark-
ably pretty, and partly because of a chance exclamation of
hers that he overheard. · The Doctor was explaining to a
little group of people the source of colour in objects—the
absorption or reflection of the different rays of light, and so
forth; and in illustration he brought a little bunch of scarlet
geraniums in a glass; turned off the light; then ignited
some common salt at the Bunsen burner, producing a power-
ful yellow flame. Of course the geraniums became of a
ghastly gray; and this pretty lady, perhaps not quite under-
standing that nothing had happened to them, exclaimed to
herself “Poor things !” Fitzgerald liked her for that. She
seemed to recognise some principle of life in the flowers, as
though they were associated with humanity somehow; and
although there might have been no profound intention in
her remark; and although, when the gas was lit again, the
geraniums were found to be quite as scarlet as ever, never-
theless Fitzgerald was convinced that she must be a nice
sort of woman. Imagine, then, his surprise when, later in
the evening—the experiments being all over, and he him-

self, doubtful whether he ought to remain, and yet anxious
to send some account of so brilliant an assemblage to
Kitty, rather keeping himself in the background-he found
himself dragged from his obscurity by the diligent Doctor,
and forthwith introduced to this very lady, and directed to
take her downstairs to supper. Not only that; but the
name she bore was also that of a distinguished Acade-
mician. Was it possible, he asked himself, as he conducted
her downstairs, that she should be the wife of the great
painter? He determined to find out; here, indeed, would
be something to talk over with John Ross.
Well, he got her a place at the long table; and timidly
asked her what she would take-a sandwich, perhaps ?
“I am not so young as I look," said this pretty, English
looking woman, with the large girlish gray eyes. “I am
the mother of three children; and at my time of life I
know better than to destroy myself with sandwiches. No
-anytbing else you can get."
She was an amazingly frank person ; and very pleasant
in her speech and her laugh. When he had got her some
cold turkey, and some bread, and a glass of claret, he
ventured to ask her, after some vague reference to some-
thing on the walls, whether she was very fond of pictures.
“I admire my husband's, of course," she said.
Then he knew he was right.
“Oh, of course," said he, with greater confidence.
“Every one does that. I suppose, now," he added, rather
hesitatingly, "your husband has become so accustomed to
his distinguished position-I mean, so familiar with his
place in the Academy—that he couldn't quite realise the.
anxiety of the outside men, of those who are not well known,
about the fate of their pictures ? That would not interest
him much, would it? I mean it would not be possible
to induce him to interest himself in—in helping, for
example—an artist who was not known
This was not at all satisfactory, especially as she seemed
to imagine he was pleading for himself.
“Are you an artist ?" she asked, at length, with a frank
look.
“Oh no."

“Well, then, to tell you truth,” said she, "I don't know
what anxiety the outsiders may feel; but it isn't half of the
anxiety they cause me. I know when my husband is on
the Hanging Committee it thoroughly breaks him down for
three weeks after. It is by far the hardest work of the
year for him. And then the thanks !—to be abused by
the public, and accused of envy by the outsiders. Envy,
indeed! I wonder who it is that my husband needs envy!”
“Why, not any one !” said Fitzgerald, warmly; for he
liked the human nature, the frank sincerity, of this woman.
“I wish they'd let the outsiders come in and hang
their own pictures for themselves !” she said, with a laugh.
“I suppose they'd all quite agree. I wish they would
paint better, and grumble less."
“Oh, but the outsider I was thinking of is not like that,”
said Fitzgerald, pleasantly, for he was not in the least
offended by her humorous petulance. “He paints very well ;
and does not grumble at all. He is quite content. Only,
I thought if your husband would be so kind as merely to
remember his name, and look at his work when it is sent
in— "
“But my husband was on the Council last year; so he
won't be again for some time—thank goodness!”
“So there is no use in my asking you to intercede ?"
“No; not even if you offer to bribe me with sandwiches.
But,” she added, looking up at him for a moment, “what is
your friend's name ?"
“John Ross."
“That is not a difficult name to remember. John Ross.
Why are you interested in him—you are not Scotch?”.
“He is a neighbour of mine; and—and he does good
work, I think—and ought to be better known."
“Landscape or figures ?”.
“ Landscape."
"I guessed as much. The Scotchmen take to landscape
because they can't draw. Now take me back, please, for I
must fetch my husband and get home; and I shan't forget
your friend's name; for I never had sandwiches offered me
as a bribe before.”
He escorted her upstairs again ; and then seized the

first opportunity of slipping away. In the hall he found he
had been preceded by Miss Chetwynd, who, quite alone,
was tying something round her neck, the night being cold.
He hesitated for a second, not quite knowing what was
proper for him to do; and then, at a venture, he went
forward and said-
“Miss Chetwynd, can I get your carriage for you?”.
“No, thank you,” she said, as he thought, a trifle
ungraciously and stiffly. “My cab is outside. I know
the man.”
The servant opened the hall-door, and she passed out;
Fitzgerald lingering for a moment under pretence of but-
toning his overcoat. Her refusal to allow him to be of this
slight service had been, as he considered, somewhat too
explicit. What had he done? Or was she unaware that
her manner was, at times, a little too decided and cold and
repellent?
It mattered not to him. He walked away through the
chill dark night to the vacant courtyard and the empty
room, thinking what a memorable and wonderful evening
that had been for him. Perhaps never such another would
happen to him; for when again was he likely to meet a
great man of science to carry him off, on the friendly in-
spiration of the moment, and introduce him to such a
gathering? And indeed the spectacle had moved him to
neither emulation nor regret. It was not the way of life
he would choose, if it were open to him. He had his own
dreams and ambitions; his own notions of what was beauti-
ful and worth having in the world ; and if Mary Chetwynd
had any vague fancy that he wished to gain an entrance
into distinguished or fashionable society, either through a
scientific doorway or through any other, she was quite mis-
taken. But more probably she had not even given a
thought to the matter; and he was content.

CHAPTER XVI.
A MORNING WALK AND OTHER MATTERS.
[N.B.—This chapter may very conveniently be passed
over by those who wish to get on with “the story ;" for it
contains little beyond a description of one or two influences
which were at this time in a measure forming the character
of this young man, and so far shaping the work of his
after-life.]
Next morning Fitzgerald had promised to go for a walk
with his Scotch neighbour, who had a theory that neither
could he paint, nor his companion write, properly, unless
they went forth from time to time to see what the outside
world was looking like. Moreover, these periodical excur-
sions were undertaken without any regard to the weather.
John Ross used to say that anybody could admire the
chromo-lithograph aspects of nature; but that it wanted
training and affectionate care and watchfulness to observe
the beautifulness of gray days and wet roads and wintry
skies. Fitzgerald, of course, was nothing loth. He had
brought his shooting boots and gaiters with him from
Ireland, and he had a serviceable waterproof; he was just
as ready as Ross to go splashing away through the mud to
Kew, to see what the wilderness part of the Gardens (a
favourite haunt of theirs, and but little known to the public)
was like in driving rain, or in feathery snow, or in clear
hard frost when the red berries shone among the green.
It was wonderful how interesting the world had become to
him. He no longer confined his attention, when out

walking, to the animals and birds he might observe (with
rapid calculations as to whether they were within shot or
without); now, if there was nothing else to be seen, the
gradation of light on the puddles of a rainy road he found
to be quite worth looking at. Nothing had been taken
away from the world; but a great deal added. It was of
itself something that he had learnt not even to despise the
commonplace gray days that in the winter so frequently
hung over Chelsea.
But he had an added interest in these various perambula-
tions of which his companion knew nothing -- he was
continually on the outlook for some pretty little cottage,
some quaint river-side house, that would meet with the
approval of Kitty's black eyes when the great time came.
This imaginary nest-building was a most fascinating kind
of occupation. Sometimes he would go away by himself
and ramble through all sorts of strange suburban places, in
the hope of meeting with something so very quaint and
picturesque and secluded that even Kitty—who rather
avoided that subject, and would not express any preference
for town or country—might have her curiosity aroused.
So far the most engaging place he had seen was a small,
odd-looking house in Grosvenor Road, fronting the river.
It appeared to have been an old-fashioned tavern at one
time; but now it was a little private dwelling, with odd
inequalities about the windows and gables, and very prettily
painted in white and green. Were not these the very
windows for Kitty to adorn with trailing plants and flower-
boxes ? Again and again, at a convenient distance, he
stood and watched the house; and tried to imagine Kitty
actually there, reaching up her arms to put a branch so, or
So; perhaps singing the while ; perhaps whistling to the
blackbird in the cage. There was the slight drawback, it
is true, that the house was not to be let; but then he and
Kitty had still a long time of waiting before them, and who
knew what might not happen in that interval ? Besides,
where there was one little habitation that seemed so
charming there might be others; and so, whatever subject
John Ross might be descanting on in his fiery-headed
fashion, and however attentively Fitzgerald might be

listening, there was nothing to prevent the eyes of the
latter from wandering from cottage to cottage, from villa to
villa, from garden to garden, in a sort of vague mechanical
quest for a pretty resting-place for Kitty.
But this particular morning was clear and cold and fine
- an excellent morning for walking; and of course
Fitzgerald had a great deal to tell about his experiences of
the previous night, and his proposal to take up some of his
companion's pictures to show to Mrs. Chetwynd.
“You see, if she were to take two or three of them, it
might be a great advantage to you," observed Fitzgerald.
“It would be a very distinct and solid advantage,"
said the red-bearded gentleman, with a laugh.
“Oh, but I mean apart from the money. Mrs.
Chetwynd knows some of the Academicians; and if your
pictures were seen by them at her house, don't you see, it
might do you good. Oh, that reminds me. I met the
wife of an Academician last night. I sha'n't tell you her
name, for she said something about Scotch artists that you
won't like."
“What was it?"
“She said they took to landscape because they couldn't
draw."
No doubt Fitzgerald repeated this with the malicious
intention of making his companion angry ; and, indeed,
for a moment John Ross stood stock still; but then again
he laughed good-naturedly and continued his walking.
“Ay, I'm thinking her husband maun be one o' the
story-tellers."
“Story-tellers ?"
6. There's plenty of them among the English artists-
men who ought to belong to your business, no' to mine.
Pent is what they know least about; but they can tell a
pretty story—out o' a book. That is something, after all.
If they know little about colour, at least they can help the
ignorant public to a bit of sentiment or the like. But
there's one thing the Scotch have done, my lad; and that
again and again ; they have had to bring both English
literature and art back to nature. It was when people
were given over to the wretched artifeecialities of the Pope

school that Allan Ramsay's 'Gentle Shepherd' and Thom
son's 'Seasons' got them back out of that hothouse to look
at real nature and human nature "
“Pope? Is that what you think of Pope ?” said his
companion, eagerly; for he had his own grudge on that score.
“Pope ?” repeated John Ross. “I consider- "
But as it turned out there was to be no conjoint dancing
on a dead man's grave; for at this moment Ross's attention
was drawn, to two young ladies who were crossing the
Hammersmith Road in front of them.
“Heaven save us !” he exclaimed. “Did ever ye see
the like o' that ?”.
“Their waists, do you mean?” his companion said ; for
indeed the two young ladies, probably sisters, for they were
dressed precisely alike, had waists of such small dimensions
that more than one person had turned and stared at them.
“The ignorant craytures,” said John Ross, half angrily,
“to think that men admire a spectacle like that! Have
they no common sense ?"
“They must have pretty good muscles, at all events, to
have pulled themselves in like that,” his companion said.
“But, bless me, common sense should tell a young lass
that it's the foolishest thing in the world for her to remind
people that she has an internal economy at all! She ought
to have none, in your imagination. She ought to be all
spirit and poetry ; just an amiable young life looking out on
the world with sweetness and innocence, and a wish to be
friendly. But when ye see a waist like that, confound it, ye're
made to ask yourself where the mischief she has put her liver!”
John Ross seemed to resent the appearance of these
young ladies, as if he had sustained some personal injury.
“I say that anything that suggests that a young lass has
a spine, or a liver, or anything of the kind, is a most
intolerable nuisance," said Ross, angrily. “And to deform
one of the most beautiful things in the world, too—that is
the figure of a young woman from the shoulders to the
waist. Look at that; do you know what that is ?”
He took out his sketch-book, and made a few japid
lines on one of the blank pages.
“A vase, I suppose."

“That is the Canopian vase ; that has always been
understood to have been imitated from the female figure.
But look what it would be if the base were to be narrowed
like the waist of one of those girls. Look; where is your
proportion now? What kind of a vase is that?”.
“Well, if you only drew the lines down a little bit
farther, it would be like one of the Pompeian earthen
jars
“Ay, the jars they stuck into the ground. Poor
craytures, that's just what they lasses there are working for.
I wonder if they havena got a mother to skelp them.”
However, the disappearance of the young ladies round
a corner removed the cause of his grumbling; and very
soon he had quite recovered his equanimity. For now the
air was growing clearer ; the roads wider ; the gardens
between the houses were larger ; and the sunlight was
making the wintry trees and bushes look quite cheerful.
“Look at that, now," Ross said, coming to a sudden
halt before some tall maples, the branches of which,
reaching away into the blue, were of the most brilliant gold
where the bark had peeled off. “Can you get anything
stronger in colour than that in the middle of summer?
Look how fine the blue is above."
“Yes, but it would look top-heavy in a picture, wouldn't
it?"
• “No, no, my lad; there you're mistaken. Sunlight
always comes out; no fear of yellow not holding its own.
If you were painting that, you would find the blue go as far
back as ever ye wanted it. I think if I were a king, that's
what I would have in my dining-chamber-solid gold up to
about the height of your head; and then above that all a
pale blue, and the roof a pale blue, so that you could let
your eyes go away a great distance when you lifted them
from the table. And then, in case the solid gold of the
wall would make you feel as if you were in a metal case, I
would have a procession of figures, all in pure scarlet,
perhaps mediæval figures, with trellis-work, or better still, a
Greek procession-
“You would have plenty of colour, then," said Fitzgerald,
laughing. “Gold, scarlet, and pale blue."

“The three primaries; why not ?"
But as there was not much apparent chance of either of
these two having to study this matter practically, it was
abandoned ; and very soon they found themselves in the
wilderness lying between the formal part of Kew Gardens
and the river. Here it was a great delight to Fitzgerald to
find himself so completely removed from all the surround-
ings of town life—watching the squirrels and the birds and
what not, while his companion now and again took jottings
of what he called the anatomy of the different kinds of
trees. The sunlight was quite clear here; and there was
plenty of rich colour among the dark green firs and the
browns and reds of withered leaves, and the glowing scarlet
of the berries that still remained on the bushes. Then
they walked back to the bridge; and for the first time
since he had left Inisheen, Fitzgerald got into a boat, and
enjoyed the new sensation of managing a pair of sculls,
while Ross sat in the stern, and seemed pleased that the
pull against the heavy current was just about as much
as Master Willie wanted. And then they had a snack
of luncheon at the nearest hotel; and then they set out to
walk back to London, with the chill gray dusk of the
afternoon slowly settling down.
But when they did get back to the big hollow-sounding
studio, Fitzgerald discovered that he had a very difficult
task before him. Whether it was that John Ross was over
fond of these children of his brain and skill, and disliked
parting with them, or whether it was that he detested the
pecuniary side of his profession altogether, Fitzgerald
found that he could get no help from him in the selection
of the pictures or sketches he wished to take to Mrs.
Chetwynd.
“How can I tell what any one's fancy may be ?” said
he, almost surlily. “Most likely she would rather have a
picture of a white lap-dog with a bit of pink ribbon round
its neck.”
“Well, we will see,” remarked Fitzgerald, who had at
length chosen out half-a-dozen canvases, and was tying them
together. “And now I must have a cab—for the first
time since I came to London ; but I expect you to pay

that, Ross, if I sell any of your pictures. That will be my
commission."
Moreover, he was himself a little anxious. As the
hansom (which was not quite so smooth-going as that of
Dr. Bude) carried him up to Hyde Park Gardens he began
to suspect that some of Ross's disinclination had probably
arisen from the fear that his work might be misunderstood
and subjected to the ignominy of refusal. That was bad
enough at the Academy; but in the case of the Academy,
there was also the consoling possibility that it was want of
space which was the practical cause of rejection. Mr.
Ross was a proud man in his way; little as he was dis-
posed to over-rate the value of his work. And Fitzgerald,
when he was actually carrying these canvases upstairs,
began to think that he had assumed a very serious respon-
sibility.
There is no doubt that this kind old lady, who examined
these landscapes as well as she could with the aid of a large
magnifying-glass, would at once, in her good-humoured
way, have purchased some of them, or perhaps even the
whole of them ; but this he would not hear of. It was
not altogether as a favour to an unknown artist that he
wished to dispose of them, he gently reminded her:
perhaps if one or two of her friends saw these studies they
would be very glad to get them. In any case he would
rather have her wait for their opinion. .
“Oh, very well,” said she, good-naturedly. “And the
price?"
Fitzgerald flushed uneasily.
“I could not get my friend to say exactly. Perhaps
-perhaps if you were to ask Mr. Sydenham to value
them - Being an Academician he ought to know."
“Oh, but that would never do. So much depends on
circumstances. So much depends on your friend's own
valuation. Have you no guess ?”
“Well,” said Fitzgerald, desperately, “I may as well
make a guess; for Mr. Ross won't help me. I think they
are worth more—but he is not known, of course—and I
don't think £20 each would be too much- "
“Would it be too little ?" said the little old lady, with a

charming frankness. “For who knows what fancy some of
our friends may take for them?”.
“If you would not mind asking Mr. Sydenham,” he
again suggested.
“Well, I will,” she said. “On that basis, that if we take
them at £20 each your friend won't be greatly dissatisfied.”
“I think he will be very much pleased. Only," he
added, with some hesitation, “if I might ask another
favour, it would be that, supposing Mr. Sydenham does
not come here this evening, or very soon, indeed, you
might not be too long in arriving at some decision. The
fact is, I would not like Mr. Ross to be thinking that his
studies were waiting out on approval, as it were "
“I understand perfectly,” said the good old lady, “and
there will be no delay, I promise you.”
That night Fitzgerald was in Ross's studio. Both were
smoking and talking ; but Ross had his sketch-book on his
knee, and also handy a box of water-colours. He was
illustrating a favourite theory of his that, after such a walk
as they had had that morning, the memory recalls most
clearly, if not exclusively, such objects as were lit up by
the sunlight; and he was jotting down memoranda of
things he could remember—the brass knob on a house
door, the zinc roof of a conservatory, a red cart-wheel
against a gray wall, and so forth, and so forth—in an
aimless sort of way, and mainly for amusement.
“There's somebody going up your stair,” he said.
Fitzgerald went out and called “Who's there?" !
“A letter for Mr. Fitzgerald,” said a voice from above.
“ All right. Bring it here. Do you want an answer ?”
“No, sir," said the lad, “I believe not, sir. Good-
night, sir."
“Good-night.”
Fitzgerald hesitated. He knew the letter was from Mrs.
Chetwynd, for the address was in Miss Chetwynd's hand.
writing ; and he would gladly, for the sake of preparation,
have opened it in his own room. But here was Ross
calling from within to know what was the matter; and so
he boldly resolved to enter and open the letter before hin,
whatever the decision might be.

“ DEAR MR. FITZGERALD,"—this was what Miss Chet-
wynd's clear, beautiful, precise handwriting said, “My aunt
says you seemed anxious to know as soon as possible the
fate of your friend's sketches; and desires me to send you
this note to-night. They have been much admired, I
believe. Mr. Sydenham took one; Dr. Bude another;

“Now isn't that a kind old lady?" said Fitzgerald.
“Fancy her taking the trouble to send a message at this
time of night. Well, what do you say, Ross? Is it
enough? You know I had nothing to guide me. Is it
enough ?”
John Ross was holding the letter in his hand, and
staring at it absently.
“I wonder which one he took. I would give anything
just to find that out,” said he, apparently to himself.
Fitzgerald took the letter from him, and glanced at it
again.
“Why, of course," said he. “I did not notice it.
That was the Academician himself who took one. I shall
find out to-morrow which one he bought. But I want to
know whether the money is sufficient.”
“ Plenty, plenty. Enough and to spare."
“Then I will trouble you for eighteenpence, that I paid
for the cab.”
“We'll make a better job of it than that, my lad,” said
he, coming to the money question at last, and shoving the
cheque across the small table. “Ye'll just take a clear half
o'that; and ye'll take a holiday, and go away over to
Ireland, and see the young lass that ye're aye thinking
about, though ye will not say so; and cheer her up.
That's sensible."
Fitzgerald give a slight backward touch to the cheque.
“No, thank you,” said he (his face a little red). “ I'm
not in want of money, thank you all the same. What I

am in want of,” he added, after a second, and with his
eyes grown distant, “is some more certain employment.
Then I would go back to Ireland, gladly enough, for a day
or two. But this literary business is so difficult."
"Is it worse than pentin??" the other demanded.
“When have I had as much money as that at one time?
Never in all my life! And sooner or later ye'll just drop
on your feet like that; and not a mere chance, such as
that is; but a settled thing; a permanency; and then I
know fine what will happen. Whistle and I'll come to
ye, my lad !' and it's a' smiles and white satin, and nervous-
ness, and the laughing and joking of your friends; and if ye
havena a jar o' good Scotch whisky for that day, then my
name's not John Ross !”
“In the meantime," said Fitzgerald, looking a bit more
cheerful, “I propose "
“In the meantime, are you going to take the money?"
said Ross, in his downright way. “Why not? I could
not have got as much for them myself. And I have plenty
to go on with.”
“No," said Fitzgerald, hastily, “but I'll tell you what
you can do, if you like. Next Saturday Mrs. Chetwynd is
going down to Hastings until the Monday. Now on the
Saturday we shall have a grand holiday, and you shall pay
for everything, from the rising of the sun till the going
down of the same-in fact, until we get back here."
“Most certainly—most certainly; but where are ye for
going this time?"
“Down the Thames—all about the docks and wharves.
I have not smelt tar, or stumbled over a rope, or had a
chat with a captain, since I left the south of Ireland. And
won't you see colour there, if the day is fine-the river, the
barges, the ruddy sails— ".
“It's done with ye,” said Ross, decisively. “It's done
with ye. And we'll get our dinner somewhere—if possible,
in a place overlooking the river. We will find out some
old-fashioned tavern-propped up on piles, maybe_with a

“Then, I'm thinking, my lad, when that bottle's opened,

CHAPTER XVII.
AN APPARITION.
But it was not fated that Fitzgerald should go to the
docks; the docks, or at least a representative of them,
came to him. The following day, early in the afternoon,
he was working away as industriously as usual, as industri-
ously as if he had had no experience of the coyness or
indifference of London publishers and editors. He was
deeply intent on what he was about; and so, when he
heard outside the preliminary tinkling of a banjo, and
made sure he was about to be serenaded by a nigger-
minstrel, he rose with much angry impatience and went to
the door, not quite sure whether the best way to get rid of
the man was to throw something to him, or to throw some-
thing at him.
When, however, he went outside, a most extraordinary
scene was presented to him in the courtyard below. It
was raining hard, to begin with. The nigger-minstrel
seemed to be very drunk, and very merry; and he was not
alone; for, backing from him, apparently in abject terror,
was a singular-looking creature, whose face Fitzgerald could
not see, but who wore a pilot-jacket much too big for him
and a huge sou’-wester, and carried a large bundle slung
over his shoulder by means of a stick. The farther that this
little man and the big sou’-wester retreated—his gestures
indicating a cowering fear—the nearer came this capering
soot-faced idiot in the dress-coat, white breeches, and vast
pink collar, singing snatches of doggerel, or begging for
money with a sort of drunken facetiousness.

“Now, Paddy, a sixpence won't hurt ye—not a sixpence
for the poor musician? A drop o dog's-nose, Paddy
two-pennorth o'gin, then, old man- ”.
Then he twanged his banjo again, and capered and
skipped, clearly enjoying the obvious fright of his victim.
“Where's your shillelagh, Paddy? Och, but ye're the
broth of a boy. Not two-pennorth o'gin for the poor
musician, Paddy?”
But the little man had retreated until he had reached
the foot of the stairs; and could back no farther. In his
desperation he shouted
“ Away wid ye! Away wid ye !” — and Fitzgerald
suddenly fancied that the voice was familiar to him.
The nigger-minstrel was not to be balked of his drunken
fun. He skipped and danced round his victim, poking at
his face with his banjo. Then something desperate hap-
pened, all at once. The little man dropped his bundle,
and, with the stick that had supported it in his hand,
seemed to jump at his enemy like a wild-cat.
- “Blood alive, but I'll bate your head in !” he yelled ;
and the next moment there was a battering of blows—that
seemed all the more terrible, because most of them fell
on the banjo with which the nigger was vainly defending
himself. Fitzgerald thought it was high time to interfere.
“Here, you !” he called from the top of the stairs.
“What are you doing there ?"
The scrimmage ceased for a second as the little man
looked up; then he uttered a slight cry. In three bounds
he was up the stairs.
“Oh, Masther Willie, 'tis yoursilf at last !” he cried.
“Glory be to God! Glory be to God, 'tis yoursilf at last,
Masther Willie "
But in his agitation Andy the Hopper could not get rid
of his alarm; and a frightened glance told him that his
enemy was also coming up the stairs.
“ Away wid ye ! Away wid ye, ye bligard! Oh,
Masther Willie, what kind of man is that? Sure I thought
he was the divil !"
“ Did you never see a nigger-minstrel before ?” said
Fitzgerald, laughing; but keeping an eye on the musician

“Well, if he isn't the divil, Andy, you'll have the divil to
pay; for you've broken his banjo."
“ And sarve the bligard right—the dirthy bligard !" said
Andy, who was much braver now, with Master Willie in
front of him. “Sure I tould him I'd bate him, and I did
-the bligard !”
But the minstrel was no longer facetious; nor was he
irate either. He was morose. He contemplated the
smashed strings of the banjo with a gloomy air. Then he
tried to get Fitzgerald to believe that this savage Paddy
had attacked him; and when Fitzgerald remarked that he
had seen the affair from the beginning, the complaint
dwindled down into a lachrymose petition for some com-
pensation. Would the gentleman look at what had been
done to his hat and his wig? Would the kind gentleman give
a poor man a drop o' something to drink, to keep out the
rheumatics ? At last he went away, pacified with a shilling;
but after Fitzgerald and his new companion had gone
inside and shut the door, they heard an extraordinary
burst of shrill laughter in the courtyard below, as if the
departing minstrel had just remembered again the joke he
had played off on the frightened Paddy.
“Well, Andy, sit down and tell me what has brought
you to London."
But Andy was quite bewildered. His delight at seeing
the young master again; the fright of his encounter with
the black creature; the strangeness of this big, bare apart-
ment—these seemed to deprive him of speech. And then
he uttered an exclamation-
"Oh, mother o' Moses, if the bligard hasn't taken my
bag !"
“What bag, Andy?”.
. “The bag wid the shnipes, and the tale, and the hares.
Sure the sight of your face, Masther Willie, has dhrew away
my sinses — "
“You must have left it down below-go and see.”
Andy quickly moved to the door; and then as suddenly
paused.
“Sure, Masther Willie, axin' your pardon, would ye come
too ?”


## p. 195 (#207) ############################################

195
Fitzgerald burst out laughing; but he went to the top
of the stairs.
“ The fellow's gone, Andy; you need not be afraid.
And so is your bag, I imagine.”
But to Andy's great delight he found the bag, which
had been kicked past the corner of the building during the
scuffle, and so had escaped observation when they were
retiring from the scene of the fight. And a very heavy
bag it was—this waterproof sack which Andy the Hopper,
having removed his sou’-wester and his big pilot-jacket,
proceeded to open. There were snipe, and teal, and
golden plover, and what not, and there were three splendid
plump brown hares. It seemed quite natural to see this
little red-haired leprechaun-looking Andy on his knees
sorting out the game.
“And where did all these come from, Andy?”.
“Sure, some from the bog; and some from the moun-
tain,” answered Andy, imperturbably.
“And who shot them?”.
“Is it who shot them? Who would be afther shooting
them but mesilf, your honour ?”.
“And who gave you leave to shoot the mountain ?".
“ Lave?” said Andy, looking up with a quite honest
stare of the small clear blue eyes. “There's no one'd be
axing for lave to shoot a shnipe or a hare for yer honour.
Yerra, who'd be axing for lave ?"
“ Oh, Andy, Andy !” said Fitzgerald. “What have you
been after ?"
For now, indeed, as Andy, with a little hesitation, drew
out a brace of fine-plumaged pheasants, and stroked their
feathers down, and smoothed out their long tails, even
Andy seemed a little bit self-conscious.
“Oh, Andy, what have you been up to ?”
“ Thrue for you, sir,” said Andy, looking very matter-of-
fact, “it isn't often thim kind o’ birds comes about the
mountain- "
“The mountain ! Do you mean to say you shot these
pheasants up the mountain ?”
“It isn't often them kind o’ birds comes about the
mountain-_” said Andy, vaguely.

“You stole them out of Lord Kinsale's coverts, I know
you did."
“ Auh! To hear the like o' that now! Shtalin'! Was
I ever afther shtalin' when I was out wid you, Masther
Willie, on both bog and mountain, many's and many's the
time? They're a foine brace o' birds, yer honour."
There was no denying that, at all events; and Andy
avoided further discussion, or confession, by proceeding to
carry the game to the adjacent table, where he laid out the
beautifully-plumaged birds brace by brace, just as he used
to do on the kitchen-dresser at Inisheen, after Master
Willie and he had come back from the mountain. And
then he was invited to come and sit by the fire and light
his pipe; the while the young master went and got a pint
bottle of ale and a tumbler for him. It was not the first
time that these two had had a chat together.
It appeared, then, from Andy's narrative, that a gentle-
man of the name of Tim Sullivan, who had married Andy's
cousin Bridget, had laid under some obligation the captain
of a trading-smack called the Molly Bawn, who, in turn,
had offered in return to Mr. Sullivan a free passage to
London-or, at least, to Limehouse—whenever he chose
to make the trip. This Mr. Sullivan seemed to be a
person of wide and ambitious views; for, though he could
not avail himself of this offer to see the world—owing to
his wife being ill, and he having to look after the pigs—he
did not wish to have it thrown away; and so he had come
to Andy the Hopper and put the chance before him.
“He says to me, ' Andy, would ye like to see London
now?' 'Divil a bit,' says I, but it's Masther Willie I'd
like to see.' 'Sure,' says he, ''tis the great chance for
ye. For what can a gintleman do in London without a
sarvint?' says he. Baithershin,' says I. 'Whose sarvint ?'
* Whose ?' says he. Who but Mr. Fitzgerald ?' 'Begor,'
says I, “but 'tis the divil's own cleverness ye've got, Tim
Sullivan ! for who'd have thought of that now?'"
“But you don't mean to say you've come all the way
from Inisheen, Andy, to try your luck in London as a
man-servant ?”
“Well, Masther Willie,” said Andy, scratching his red

that the master as this all tions of fortune,
hair with much perplexity, “not in a gineral kind of a
way; but if it was yoursilf, sorr— "
Fitzgerald glanced round the apartment.
“Does this look as if I needed a man-servant, Andy ?”
Now there is very little doubt that Andy the Hopper
had been possessed with the conviction that Master Willie,
having gone away to make his fortune, would be living in
grand style; but his notions of grandeur were vague; and
in any case, was this all of the house that belonged to the
young master ? Fitzgerald had gently to explain to him
that these visions that Mr. Sullivan had awakened were not
practical ; and he was very much pleased to hear that
Andy could get a free passage back in about ten days'
time, and also that one of the hands on board the smack
had got him a lodgment at Limehouse. Nor was Andy so
greatly disappointed. He had always been accustomed to
take Master Willie's advice as something that there was no
contesting; and he quickly fell in with the notion that,
now he was here, the best thing he could do was to see as
much of London as he could, that he might be a great
person when he got back to Inisheen.
“How you ever got here I don't understand,” Fitzgerald
said.
“Sure, thin, your honour, 'twas one of the boys that
tould me the river went all the way through the town, from
ind to ind, and says he, "keep to the shtrame, and ask the
people from toime to toime.' 'Tis iver since the morning
I've been at it; but glory be to God, I found ye at last,
Masther Willie ; and that's the best part av the story they'll
be wanting to hear about, when I get back to Inisheen.”
“Well, now, Andy, begin and tell me all the news.
Were there many cock about this winter? Was my father
out shooting any time?”.
Thus invited, the little impish-looking red-haired man,
sucking away at a short clay pipe the while, began to tell
all that had happened since Master Willie had left Inisheen;
and very far and wide did these rambling reminiscences
extend. It is impossible to say how interesting these were
to Fitzgerald ; and yet on one point, the most interesting
of all, Andy had nothing to say, and he dared not ask.


## p. 198 (#210) ############################################

SHANDON BELLS
What, indeed, could Andy know? Miss Romayne had
not been back to Inisheen since she had left it shortly after
his own leaving, and Andy's visits to Cork were the rarest
things in his life—otherwise it is quite possible he might
there have made himself familiar with the appearance of a
nigger-minstrel. How could he know anything about
Kitty; and yet the charm of all this news to Master Willie
was that it spoke to him of the neighbourhood where he
and Kitty had been together.
At last, this became too tantalising.
" Andy,” says he, “ do you remember the young lady
that came down to Inisheen, and stayed in Widow Flana-
gan's house for a time?"
“Faix I do,” said Andy, with a facetious grin. “Sure
I remimber well enough the poor gyurl your honour made
a fool of.”
He flushed resentfully. But how could he complain of
this familiarity? He had brought it on himself by his
injudicious questioning. And then, no doubt, Andy con-
sidered this a little bit of astute flattery to regard the young
master as a gay Lothario.
“She did not break her heart though ye did lave her,
Masther Willie, and that's thrue," he added, with another
pull at the pipe.
“How do you know? How do you know anything
about her?” said Fitzgerald, angrily.
“'Twas Corney Malone,” continued Andy, with the
composure of indifference—for he doubtless thought this
was but as another of his items of news" was up at Cork,
to see his daughter Biddy and the two boys—that's Pathrick
with the squint eye and young Corney-he was afther seeing
them away to Americay—and sure, your honour, that's the
way wid em all now, and soon there'll be nobody left in the
counthry but the gossoons and the ould women—and when
he came back to Inisheen he was in the kitchen at the
Impayrial, and says he, “Sure the foine young lady that
Masther Willie was sportin' about wid hasn't broken her
heart for his laving of her. What d'ye mane, Corney ?'
says I, for I was in the kitchen too-if it was not for a
shnipe or two, or a mallard mebbe, how could a poor man

earn his living, your honour ?—and says I, • Corney, what
d'ye mane?' 'Faix,' says he, "'tis another one now she's
sportin' about wid—a young spark from Dublin.”
For a moment to Fitzgerald the world seemed to whirl
round; a kind of blackness came before his eyes; life was
slipping away from him. But the next instant there was a
backward rush-of contempt and indignation.
.“Who the devil told you to bring your kitchen gabble
here?” he said, in a tone that made Andy drop his pipe.
Then he was deeply mortified with himself. As if it was of
the slightest consequence what reports might be going about
Kitty in Inisheen or elsewhere! And was it not shameful
that he should have allowed himself to be startled? He
instantly assumed a forcedly tranquil air ; and said, quite
good-naturedly“
“Well, Andy, I suppose there isn't much doing just now
in Inisheen; no doubt the people about the Imperial are
glad to have things to talk about, however foolish they may

“Thrue for you, sorr," said Andy, contentedly; he
seemed quite unaware of having caused any quick pang of
dismay.
“Mr. Corney Malone has been putting a lot of nonsense
in your head," said Fitzgerald, presently. “I suppose he
is vexed because the young lady did not buy any ribbons
or pocket-handkerchiefs at his shop-things that he buys in
Cork and sells to you Inisheen people at double the price.”
“The divil sweep him !” said Andy, with heartfelt satis-
faction: it was enough for him that Master Willie had
declared against Corney Malone.
He invited Andy to continue his gossip; but that was
less interesting now. He scarcely listened. He was think-
ing of Kitty's letters—the very breathings of her soul ;
could any one who had read these charming, inconsequent,
affectionate prattlings doubt the honesty of her who had
written them? It was at himself he was wondering: Why
should he have felt, for even a second, this blackness of
death grip his heart? It was for this, then, that she had
given him the great treasure of her love-that, at the first
idle tale, he should imagine it possible for her to be a

at of the sayihting for poof he had
common flirt? What Hilton Clarke had said, then, was
true? She should not have been left alone? Perhaps she
also had the “unappeasable heart”? Perhaps he was ready
to believe that the little shoots of tenderness had already
gone out to cling to somebody else? Thus it was, that
while Andy the Hopper was giving a religiously accurate
account of the sayings and doings of everybody in Inisheen,
Master Willie_fighting for poor Kitty, who was so far away
-was proving to himself that he had never deserved to
have her love, or he would not have allowed that foolish
rumour to have dealt him such a blow.
Still, he wished to get out into the open air.
“Andy,” said he, looking at his watch, “I have an
engagement now; but I shall be back by a quarter-past
seven. You can't go away down to Limehouse to-night;
you would never get there. I will see if the landlady here
can get you a bed for the night somewhere; and you'll
want some supper. Wait here till I come back.”
“A word wid ye, your honour," said Andy, anxiously.
“ May I make so bould as to bolt the door when your
honour's gone?"
“Oh yes, certainly. But there is no chance of the black
gentleman coming back.”
It was still raining out here in the dark night; and he
put up his umbrella unconsciously; but there were not
many objects he passed during his rapid walk up to Hyde
Park Gardens that he noticed or could have remembered.
His thoughts were far away. Why should poor Kitty have
been made the subject of idle rumours like these? What
could Corney Malone know of her ? Corney Malone was
a small shopkeeper in Inisheen ; apparently he had been
unable to support his family or to procure work for them
in the old country; so he had been drafting them off to
America. And it was likely that, during that short visit to
Cork, he should get to know anything of Miss Romayne !
Even if he saw her walking with any one which was
absurd — how could he tell that the person was from
Dublin? What would Kitty say when he should tell her
-as he certainly should—that this bit of tittle-tattle, com-
ing unexpectedly, had very nearly parted soul and body?

He recalled that sensation with a sort of shudder. It
seemed as if the world were falling away from around him ;
and that he was blind. And all because Corney Malone,
in the back-kitchen of the Imperial, had been chattering
spiteful nonsense to the idlers about. Perhaps it was well
for the symmetry of Mr. Malone's features—which was not
much to boast of at the best—that he was not anywhere
about Fitzgerald's neighbourhood just at this present
moment.
He reached Hyde Park Gardens, and set to work to get
through the hour mechanically. Fortunately that was easy;
for he had brought with him a newly-published volume of
Arctic travel, which was exceedingly interesting, and was
making much stir; and he had had time to mark the salient
passages. How strange it was to read of that far white
land ; and to see behind it, all the time, the harbour and
the hills of Inisheen! It was Inisheen he was thinking of;
not Cork. He did not like to think of the streets of Cork.
And then, all of a sudden, there sprang into his recollection
a phrase in one of Kitty's letters, written long ago when she
was in Dublin—"Willie, there's a man bothering me with
bouquets.” His face grew red. He stumbled on with his
reading. But the redness of his face was caused by anger
with himself that this recollection could annoy him. He
had no time to argue the matter with himself; he was
reading about the Arctic zone; sometimes Mrs. Chetwynd
said “Poor fellows, how they must have enjoyed that
Christmas feast,” or “ Dear me, that was a narrow escape ;"
and he had to read on and on, with the streets of Cork,
instead of Inisheen, thrusting themselves in as a background
to all his hurried, staccato, agonised thinking.
So glad he was when that hour of unimaginable torture
was over; and he could rush out into the night to avoid
the demons that were seeking to devour him! He would
not face them; for he would not acknowledge their exist-
ence. He would not admit to himself that he could have
any doubts of Kitty's love, her faith and honour. He
hurried on his way; persuading himself that he was sorry
for Andy's waiting there alone. It was kind of Dr. Bude
to have interested himself in John Ross; and to have got

some friend to offer to take two more sketches. Ross
must see Andy the Hopper; and make a drawing of him.
Ross might make a little copy of it; and he would send
that to Kitty to amuse her; to Kitty who was so lonely
away up there on the hill. “Just tell them there's a poor
girl in Ireland, who is breaking her heart for your sake”_
that was what she had written. As for any one sending
her bouquets—why not? What more natural ? They
threw them to her on the concert-stage ; why not send
them? She had not even seen the man. How could they
know that Kitty was married already; that her vow had
been registered in the unseen world ; that her faithfulness
had been celebrated in the great hall where the little people
sounded their silver gongs, and the care of “ Catherine"
was given over to them? He knew and she knew; that
was enough; the outside world might go its way. “Let
this be a love night,” Kitty had said, down by the running
water; she could scarcely be got to repeat the curse ; she
knew there never would be any occasion for that. And to
speak of poor Kitty as having been jilted! Well, no matter.
He and she knew; the little ringlets round her ears had
heard their secrets; the outside world might go its way.
From these dreams, that seemed to grow brighter and
brighter the faster he walked, he was awakened by his
arrival at his lodging, and the necessity of supplying Andy
with some supper and a bed in the neighbourhood. There
was no difficulty about either. At supper (John Ross
could not be found, or he would have been invited to join),
Andy insisted on observing the etiquette of the luncheons
on the mountain. That is to say, he would wait about
until the young master had finished_helping now and
again to hand things as well as he knew. Then, when he
had followed, and disposed of a hasty meal, he had no
objection to light a pipe and chat on the ordinary familiar
terms.
But all the fascination had gone from Andy the Hopper's
gossip. He found the young master sorely distraught;
more than that, he seemed to become impatient from time
to time, as though he could not bear having his thoughts
disturbed.

“Sure, Masther Willie,” said Andy at length, “there
was nothing to vex ye in the sthory that Corney Malone
brought back from Cork— bad luck to the omadhaun! "
“Oh, hold your tongue, Andy!” said Fitzgerald, rising
and going to the window. “It is still raining. See here,
now. Will you be able to make your way back to Lime-
house to-morrow ?”
“Yerra, your honour, as I came here I can go back !”
“If there's any sun you can make straight south till you
meet the river. If there isn't, ask the nearest way. Then
you'll find yourself near Chelsea pier; and the boat will
take you down. Can you remember that, now ?"
“Sure we'll shpake of it in the marnin, your honour,"
said Andy, who was very comfortable now by the fire.
“I shan't see you in the morning," said Fitzgerald,
briefly. “I am going away from London for a day or
two- "
“The Lord be marciful to us, Masther Willie ; but is it
bad news ye've got ?".
“No, no. I am coming back in a day or two_long
before the Molly Bawn can get in her cargo. I'll find you
out at Limehouse; and bring you back here. I'll have
your portrait painted, Andy; but where's the jacket with
the red sleeves ?"
“Sure I thought if your honour wanted a sarvint,
'twasn't the ould jacket you'd be afther wishing to have
about the house. But that was the jacket that tased the
bull into the bog-d'ye mind that, Masther Willie?"
“Don't I !"
This resolution of his once taken—that, come what
• might, he would start by the Irish mail in the morning, and
take the long journey to Cork, and seek out Kitty, just for
a moment of holding her two shoulders and gazing into
the beautiful, soft eyes—Andy's gossip seemed far more
bearable. What was not bearable was that, amid all the
vague thoughts conjured up by this aimless talking, now
and again his heart should stop short suddenly, as if there
· was something he dared not face. He could not banish
from him the consciousness that, however he might argue
himself out of foolish doubt in the daytime, in the night

dark things would occupy his mind. And Kitty's eyes
were so loving ; they would have no reproach in them, if
he went to her and asked her to help him to banish for
ever this ghastly nightmare. Just to take her hand for a
moment—that would be enough. Was it not the hand he
had held over the little stream running down to the Black-
water and the sea ?

STORM AND CALM.
This was a strange setting out to go and see Kitty.
Where was the gladness of it? Why should there be fear,
and a touch of shame, and a hundred horrible distractions
and suggestions, instead of the simple joyousness of the
thought that soon he would have Kitty's love-lit eyes
regarding him ? He had not slept much that night.
Long before there was any need he had dressed and gone
out, making his way to the station through the dark empty
streets. In the cold railway-carriage he sat distraught; the
spectacle of the gray dawn disclosing itself over the sleeping
landscape had no interest for him. He was as one in a
dream.
And then sometimes he would ask himself sharp and
angry questions. Supposing this rumour to be true, had
he not himself to blame? Why had he ever left Cork ?
What had the wretched ambition to play a part in literature
to do with the happiness of his life? Why had he been
content to live in a fool's paradise in London, when he
ought to have been by Kitty's side? Was it not his place?
But he must needs go and leave her alone—she young and
tender-eyed, and wandering from one town to another,
How could that fool of a woman be a proper guardian for
her? And what more natural than that here or there
some one should wish to pay Kitty some attention? she
was so quick in sympathy; so gentle-hearted; with “her
young eyes still wounding where they looked.”
And then again he reproached himself for entertaining

for a moment the monstrous supposition that his faithful
Kitty, who had sworn her love to him over the brook on
that wonderful moonlit night, should encourage the atten-
tions of any one. And how was he going to approach her?
How make an excuse for appearing in Audley Place?
Should he play the spy, then? This was a strange setting
out to go and see Kitty.
But when he got near to Holyhead the first glimpse of
the sea made his heart leap up. Had not these gloomy
fancies and forebodings been the product of a town life?
The cold sea-air seemed to drive them away. Of course
he should meet Kitty as of old; and they would talk
about Inisheen; and if the winter roads were rather too
muddy for country walks, they would be quite content with
the wide pavements of the town, and would be happy
enough in the South Mall, or in St. Patrick's Street, or the
Mardyke Parade. Kitty's warm little hand would be on
his arm. They would talk about their future life together.
Would she look up trustingly, or look down shyly, when
he told her of the quaint little house by the river with its
woodwork of white and green?
He grew so hopeful that he had even time to think of
John Ross; and to wish that he were also on board this
great steamer. Would not these wonders be sufficient for
him? For at one moment they were slowly steaming
through a fog that was suffused with a yellow sunlight-
the fog-horn booming and answering similar warnings from
ships that were invisible—and then again they would
suddenly emerge into a perfectly clear space—the sea
quite smooth and glassy and blue, perhaps some massive
brig or heavy schooner lying motionless on the mirror-like
surface, with all its idle sails accurately reflected. It was a
tedious crossing on the whole. Sometimes they stole out
from one of these encircling fogs to find another steamer,
or motionless sailing vessel, most dangerously near. But
before they reached Kingstown they had left the fogs
completely behind them; and the sun was shining plea-
santly on the harbour and the shipping and the houses, as
if his native country were giving him a friendly and smiling
welcome.

In the long journey, moreover, away to the south, he
had distraction in the society of a middle-aged priest, a
person of meagre aspect and of sallow complexion, who
had gray eyes with black eyebrows and eyelashes. Fitz-
gerald very soon found that these gray eyes were capable
of expressing a good deal of passionate feeling-especially
anger. The priest was a perfervid politician; and his
language was far from temperate. Now Fitzgerald was
scarcely a politician at all. The Cork Chronicle had not
seen fit to take the affairs of the Empire under its care.
At Inisheen, again, he had generally preferred to the Tim
or Pat who skulked out of the town for midnight drill
(frightening away the wild-fowl, besides), the Tim or Pat
who worked contentedly at his little farm, and had a
pleasant “Good morrow” for the passer-by, and knew
whereabouts a hare was to be found. He had his doubts
about the wonderful magic to be wrought by “Repeal ;"
and had a vague sort of belief that, even under the present
system, an Irishman, if he condescended to work, had just
seen nisheen, again, he out of the towhes), th
Englishman. It will be seen that these were not very
definite convictions; and this good Father got himself into
white heat in showing Fitzgerald how shameful it was of an
Irishman to be so indifferent. Fitzgerald took no shame
to himself. Politics had not been much in his way. A
young man who has to earn his own living must think of
that first before proceeding to look after the affairs of the
country (unless, indeed, he is the younger son of a noble-
man, when he may have an opportunity of accomplishing
the former at the expense of the latter), and though
Fitzgerald was quite willing to listen to this impassioned
clerical—and rather glad, perhaps, to have the tedium of
the long railway journey so relieved—it was not to be
expected that he should suddenly acquire an intense
interest in party strife. Indeed it may afford an illustration
of certain influences that had been at work on him to say
that while the priest was denouncing the action of the
Government as having been the direct and obvious cause
of Irish disaffection, Fitzgerald, regarding the gray eyes,
was wondering whether any colour or any artistic skill

could convey to canvas the curious light that glowed
there.
But as they drew nearer and nearer to Cork—it was
now the middle of the night-neither political discussion
nor artistic contemplation was sufficient to distract his mind.
He scarcely heard what the good man said. He assented
to anything. He was thinking of his meeting with Kitty
in the morning; and his heart was heavy with fear— fear
of he scarcely knew what. It was so strange that he
should be afraid of meeting Kitty! Would she believe
that? Would she see it? What explanation could he
make?
Then he thought of her recent letters. It is true that,
once or twice, she had seemed to grow despondent, and
perhaps even a little bit tired of waiting ; but for the most
part she had written as cheerfully and kindly as ever.
What reason, then, could he give for this sudden visit ?
Could he confess to her that he had formed suspicions of
her—and that on the authority of a rumour brought by
such a messenger as Andy the Hopper ?
“You don't believe my letters, then," would she not say ?
“You consider I have been playing the hypocrite? My
affection for you was a pretence. You cannot trust what I
say; you have to come over and see for yourself; it is thus
you recognise the sacredness of the vow that we swore in
the glen? That is the importance you yourself attach to
it ; that it is so slight a tie it can have melted away already;
you come over to see who it is that has so soon come
between us two !”
How could he withstand the reproachful look of Kitty's
eyes ? How could he show to her how weak had been
his faith in her ? If it were so easily snapped on so slight
a strain, how could it withstand the rougher usage, the
long wear and tear of the world?
But then Kitty was so honest and so kind ; if he were
quite frank with her, and told her that his better reason
knew how groundless these fears were, and that only to
show himself how absurd they were had he taken this long
journey—if he were to throw himself on her mercy—if he
were to say, “ Kitty, laugh at me as you like; but lonely

living in London has weakened my nerves; and I can't
hear anything about you but my heart jumps ; so here I
am, just to have a look at you, and to laugh at myself, if
you like, for my idle fright.” Would Kitty laugh? Not
she. She was too kind for that. Her warm and gentle
heart had no malice in it at all. She would say, “ Then
look at me. Look down into my eyes. Can you find
anything but love, and truth, and constancy?”
On arriving at Cork, he went to the Imperial Hotel ; it
was between two and three in the morning. He was very
tired, and he slept well. On awaking, he could not under-
stand where he was—for a second; the next second his
heart almost stood still : he had to face Kitty.
Then, if so, the sooner the better. When he went out
into the wide thoroughfares on this quiet Sunday morning,
they were shining just as cheerfully in the sunlight as on
that former Sunday morning when his life seemed to be
rejoicing within him at the thought of his climbing the
steep little thoroughfare at the top of which Kitty lodged.
Now he kept his eyes about him, as if people might be
watching him. Would they know what had brought him
to Cork? There might be a friend of Kitty's somewhere
about who would wonder to see him. Perhaps - But
no; he could not consider that possible.
And yet it was wonderful to him that perhaps so late as
even yesterday Kitty had been looking at these very quays
and boats; and had crossed this bridge; and had been
opposite yonder house. That was the interest of the scene
to him ; John Ross's teaching was forgotten; he was not
thinking of the colour of the sea, or of the greens and
grays and whites of this steep little thoroughfare. He had
scarcely a look for Shandon tower, when he had climbed
the hill; he did not notice the hoar-frost on the ground
where the sun had not reached it; nor the extent of
wintry landscape, with its leafless trees and hedges. He
only knew that not a soul was visible along the little terrace ;
and that he dared not go near the house. He must see
Kitty alone, and here.
He waited and waited; walking this way and that, but
not passing the house. The clock in Shandon tower over

there struck half-past ten; but still she did not come.
Why should she? No country walks were possible now;
no doubt the wet weather had left the lanes full of mud.
And if she were not to stir forth at all—bright as the
morning happened to be ?
Then the whole aspect of the world changed; Kitty
was there. The day seemed fuller and richer; delight
took possession of him ; he lost fear. Kitty did not see
him at first; she looked abroad over the country as she
came down to the little iron gate ; and as she came along
he noticed that she carried a prayer-book in her hand.
“Kitty!"
She looked up—with something of fear, as he thought,
in her startled glance.
He seized her hands, and kissed her.
“ You are not glad to see me, then ?” he said, cheer-
fully.
“Well, but—but,” she said, “—but nothing has
happened ?”.
“Nothing,” said he. “I have come to see you, that is all."
“You have given me a great fright,” said she, and she
was still a little pale. “Why did you not write to me?
What is the meaning of it?"
He was so delighted with regarding her—the pretty
outline of her cheek and chin—the soft, timid blackness of
her eyes—the bits of curls that were around her small ears
-that he scarcely heard what she said.
“You have not altered a bit, Kitty," said he in his
gladness. “You are just as much my Kitty as ever-and
ever so much nicer to look at than your portrait. It hasn't
been satisfactory, Kitty, trying to get that portrait to speak
to me of an evening, when I was quite alone. It looked
at me; but not as you look now. But still—why do you
look so—10—50- Kitty, are you not glad to see
me ?"
“Well, of course,” said she, but not with the greatest
cordiality. “You need not have frightened me. It is a
Jack-in-the-box kind of way of coming to see one. Why
did you not write ?"
"Well, the surprise- " He could not tell her the

truth; nay, there was happily no need for him to tell it her.
He had looked in her eyes; that was enough.
“And the cost, too, I suppose," said she. “Do you
think it is very wise, Willie, to throw away money like that?
I did not understand you were getting on so very well."
He stared at her in astonishment; not hurt nor vexed,
but simply wondering.
“Kitty, you talk as if you really were not glad that I
have come to see you. You don't talk like my Kitty at all!”
“Of course I am glad," she said. “But people can't
always have what they like. I really don't see that it is
wise to go throwing away money on these constant trips-
especially in the case of people whose future doesn't look
over bright.”
“ Constant trips, Kitty! This is the second since I
went to London; and the first was eight or nine months
ago-2"
“But what is the use of it?"
“ There is no use in it—there is no use in it, Kitty,"
said he, rather bewildered. “And if I had thought that
this was to be my reception- "
“Oh, but we are not going to quarrel,” said she, with
something more of her ordinary kindness in her manner.
“If you have been extravagant, we must make the best of
it. I am going to church ; I suppose you will come with
me.”
She put her hand in his arm, in the old familiar way;
he could not but take it and pat it.
“I will go to church with you, if you like, Kitty ; but
might we not have a walk and a chat instead? There
must be a lot to say after such a long separation.”
“We cannot walk about," she said, “the roads are too
wet. Besides I told Miss Patience I was going to church.
And besides,” she added, with a little laugh, "we have not
been quite idle in letter-writing, Willie; there cannot be so
very much to say.” .
“Oh, very well, Kitty. I will go to church with you;
I don't care much where we go, so long as I am by your
side. And when you have been to church, Kitty, you will
be a little more gentle and civil in your manner.”

“But I am gentleness and civility itself !” she remon-
strated. “It is you who are reckless and wild. You don't
care what any freak costs you. I believe I was mad when
I engaged myself to you.”
“No use saying that now, Kitty, it is past praying for.”
“I suppose so."
They were on much more friendly terms now. Perhaps
Kitty had only resented her having been frightened. It
was quite like old times for them to be walking arm-in-
arm; and the bell in Shandon tower was tolling; and the
people were coming along the various thoroughfares to the
church.
“By the way,” said he, "we have never settled in what
church we shall be married, Kitty."
“That's being rather too particular. That's looking
rather too far forward, isn't it?"
“I am not so sure about that,” said he.
“You have discovered the gold mine, then? Is that
what you came to tell me about, Willie ?" she said, with an
odd kind of smile.
But they were entering the church porch ; and there
was no possibility for further speech. Sitting there beside
her, indeed, he did not complain of the enforced silence.
To be near her was enough; to have tight hold of her
hand; to hear the sweet voice join in the singing. Perhaps
he did not listen too attentively to the service or the
sermon. Dreams of what the world might hold for him
and her together would come in from time to time. The
imaginations and ambitions of youth are stimulated rather
than retarded by the hushed and mysterious repose of a
sacred building; the vague dim background is convenient for
the painting of wonderful pictures. And it seemed to him
that that beautiful future, which he could adorn and colour
at will, had once more and suddenly been presented to
him. These horrible doubts had been left behind. They
vanished when he took Kitty's hand in his. There was
no need for explanation or confession ; Kitty and he were
together again ; life had grown full again of joy and hope.
And London, with its struggles and mortifications, and
disappointments, was also forgotten. Shandon church,

with Kitty's hand in his, left him no memories of the
Fulham Road. It was as if it had only been the other
night that he and she pledged their vows to each other over
the running stream.
When they came out again she said,
“Now you will come and have some dinner with us,
Willie; and you must try and be civil to Miss Patience.”
“I would rather go for a walk, Kitty,” said he. “We
have said nothing to each other yet.”
“What is there to say that we have not said before ?"
she answered, somewhat saucily, " or that we can't say in
letters ?"
“Your letters are very nice, Kitty, but they don't speak
as well as your eyes."
“Oh, I assure you," she said, gravely, “I am going to
take my eyes with me wherever I go. Don't be afraid. I
shall have my eyes as much with me when we are sitting
down at the table as if we were wandering through these
muddy lanes.”
No, she would not be persuaded. She thought there
would not even be time for a stroll down to the river-side
and back. It was too cold for walking. She was rather
tired.
“ Tired !" said he, in amazement; "what can have tired
you?”
“You are so pertinacious,” she said, with a touch of
impatience. “You want to argue. You want explanations.
When I tell you I am tired, isn't that enough ?"
“Well, yes, it is enough,” said he, gently. “And I
think you must be tired.”
The subtlety of this reproof reached her. She coloured
a little.
“I want to be kind to you; but you're always quarrel-
ling!” she said.
And then she laughed; and looked so pretty, and
confused, and merry, all at once, that he could have kissed
her there and then, though all Cork might stare.
"I declare it's enough to put anybody out of temper,”
said she, with all her ordinary frankness and audacity,
" Here am I supposed to be cultivating the greatest

admiration for somebody who is away in London, working
hard on my account. It is so self-denying, don't you see ;
and you ought to remember the absent; and all the rest
of it. And all at once he turns up on a holiday trip !
frightening you to begin with ; and not a word of excuse

“I have quite sufficient reason, Kitty,” said he. “The
delight of listening to your impertinence is quite enough."
“I am not impertinent at all; I am talking common
sense—and that's a thing you don't know much about,
Master Willie. The fact is, these people at Inisheen
spoiled you. You think you should have everything you
want; now, that isn't quite possible in this fine world.”
“Kitty, you have been studying the Poor Man's Annual,
or whatever the book is. You are fearfully wise this
morning. This is the second time you have informed me
that people can't get everything they want; and the truth
of the aphorism is more remarkable than its novelty- ".
“Oh dear me, is that the way we talk in London ?"
said she.
“ There's only one thing I want,” said he, not heeding
her; "and I've got it hard and fast.”
“But you need not break my fingers with your arm. I
shan't be able to practise to-morrow. What is that in your
breast-pocket that hurts so ?”.
“That?" said he. “It would be odd if that could
hurt anybody. It's your portrait, Kitty. I had a case
made for it.”
“Let me see it."
He took out the case and showed it her; she only
looked at the outside.
“Well, I do declare ! the extravagance! And this is
the way we are supposed to be saving money in London-
buying anything that touches our fancy, or rattling away on
a holiday ? That is just like you Irish people. I see
more and more of it every day. You can deny yourselves
nothing. You must always spend more than you've got ;
and then expect the Government to keep you. "
“Who has been giving you lessons in political economy,
Kitty ?” he said, as he took the case from her, and put it

in another pocket. “You have become fearfully prac.
tical- "
“That's what you will never be,” she said, with a little
sigh-real or affected.
“I did not think you would consider that much of an
extravagance," said he, "getting a nice cover for your
photograph.”
“But coming away over here "
“ That seems quite to distress you. "
“Oh dear no,” she said—they were now going up to
the door of the house, and she spoke in a more matter-of-
fact way. “Perhaps I ought to be glad. It shows you
can afford it."
As he entered the little passage, he caught a glimpse of
a female figure flying upstairs; then Kitty asked him to go
into the adjacent parlour, and wait till she had put off her
things; then he was left alone.
This meeting with Kitty had not been like that other
meeting that he so clearly remembered. Then she had
clung to him, crying ; she had begged of him never to
leave her again; she had offered to live on nothing rather
than that he should go away from her. Now she had grown
so practical ; she seemed to wish him back in London; it
was the cost of his visit, not the surprise and delight of
it, that seemed to occupy her mind. But still, here he was
in the little chamber that was so familiar; there was Kitty's
piano, and the dishevelled mass of music that she never
would keep in order ; there were the books he had sent her
(he knew better than to look whether the edges were cut;
disappointments come easily enough without people hunting
after them); there was the crystal paper-weight in which
Kitty had put his photograph, saying the while, “Well, so
long as that is before me while I am writing, I guess I shall
look sharp after my grammar. I can see the scowl begin-
ning already. “None of your impertinence, Miss. Can't
you spell the English language yet? You think that is clever,
do you ?' So there's a place for you, Mr. Schoolmaster Kill-
joy; and when I want a scolding I'll come for it.”
The little maid-servant came in and laid the cloth; and
then Miss Patience appeared.

Miss Patience received him with much placid civility.
She seemed more mysterious and hawk-like than ever, and
seemed to take it for granted that he, having been so much
longer in London, should know proportionately more of the
secret things going on in politics. Fitzgerald had to
explain to her that he had had but little to do with politics ;
even the one editor he had met in London, he had not
seen since last he had visited Cork.
“I heard you were not succeeding,” remarked Miss
Patience, calmly.
"Succeeding!” he exclaimed with a sort of start (for he
had not looked at his struggles in London in that way).
“Well, I have been trying many things; and it is im-
possible to say whether this or that may succeed. I can-
not expect everything at once. There are many openings
in literary and newspaper work; of course one must wait.
I can't say I have either succeeded or not succeeded.”
“Ah," said Miss Patience, complacently. “That is all
so unlike commerce. Commerce is secure. Just think of
sending a telegram to Odessa—a few words ; you get a
reply back the same day; you walk down to the Exchange
and buy something; and you have earned £2000. Two
thousand pounds !- with so little trouble- "
But here Kitty came in ; and she had dressed so prettily
and neatly! He could not help regarding her with admir-
ing looks; and Miss Kitty was a little bit shy and
conscious; and so they sat down to this middle-day dinner
- London, black phantoms, and disappointments, all shut
out and forgotten.
“It seems to me, Kitty,” said he, lightly, “that a com-
mercial spirit has come over this neighbourhood since I
was here last. You have been lecturing on political
economy all the morning; and now Miss Patience tells me
how easy it is to make £2000 by merely sending a telegram
to Odessa. It appears to me that it might be just as easy
to lose £2000 by the use of the same machinery.”
Kitty glanced at Miss Patience with a sort of apprehen-
sive look he could not understand.
“I was observing to Mr. Fitzgerald that I was sorry he had
not been successful in London,” answered that lady, calmly,

STORM AND CALM
217
" And I was saying that I had neither been successful
nor non-successful,” said Fitzgerald, cheerfully. “Of course
there are a great many things to be tried— ”
“Oh, of course, of course," said Kitty, hastily, and with
a touch of colour in her face. “Of course Miss Patience
meant so far only—only so far. We know that it is diffi-
cult to-to-to succeed in literature-of course Miss
Patience quite understands "
If Miss Patience understood, Fitzgerald did not. Why
this embarrassment; and this talk about the advantages of
commerce; and this assumption that he had tried literature
in London as a means of livelihood and failed ?
Miss Patience said with a gentle smile- .
“But when once you have that commercial machinery
of which you speak, Mr. Fitzgerald, how nice that must be !
It goes on making money for you; you can go away and
see the world; your agents are enough. That must be
very nice, that independence and security. The literary
man, even the most successful, is in so precarious a position.
A tile from a roof knocks him senseless; his means of
livelihood vanish. No one else can do his work for him ;
it is like an artist becoming blind ; there is no machine that
can go on independently of him to make money for his wife
and children. Ah, there is nothing so safe as that. Com-
merce in a commercial country is a natural occupation.
And it is so safe.”
But was it so safe? argued Fitzgerald, somewhat hotly
—though he scarcely knew why, for certainly commerce
had never done him any harm. If it were so safe and
natural and easy to make £2000 by telegraphing to Odessa,
wouldn't everybody be at it? Then look at the common
failures. Look at the multitude of commercial men, who
were living on the very edge of bankruptcy. It was all very
well to have such a piece of machinery as that that had
been mentioned, but what if it happened to work the
wrong way? What if it came back, and burst you ? No
doubt it was a good thing if the commercial man could
lay by a provision for his wife and children ; but could
not the successful man of letters do that too? And as for
the tile from the roof, where would the commercial man be

if that hit him? Accidents were always possible. What
was not possible was that life should be based on idle
calculations. And, success or no success, machinery or no
machinery, as for himself, he said proudly, he would rather
earn the plainest living by literature than revel in all the
riches that could be procured from Odessa or anywhere
else.
Kitty was the peacemaker.
“Oh yes, no doubt,” said she though she seemed
anxious to get away from the subject altogether). “One
would like to be what you say—I mean, it must be a great
thing to be a great man of letters—but there are so few-
and it must be so difficult. I am sure that all Miss
Patience meant was that it must be nice to have a busi-
ness going on that leaves you free and gives you no
anxiety-
“I should say there were very few of those,” said he.
“ Leave a business and it leaves you—the proverb is com-
mon among business men themselves. You wake up some
fine morning and find yourself a bankrupt.”
“Ah, very well,” said Kitty, with a sigh, “those at least
are very well off who begin life with a fortune ready made
for them, and have no anxiety about it.”
“I don't know that,” said he; “the enjoyment of life is
work. I don't see that people who are securely rich are
any the happier for it. And I should not think much of
the woman whose views of life were coloured by the presence
or absence of money."
This was getting more serious. Kitty said, with a plea-
sant laugh—
“There is not much use in our talking about it any-
way; for all the money that you and I have, Willie, or are
likely to have, won't make nations fight about us. I want
you to tell Miss Patience about all the people you have seen
in London. And is that old lady really so nice as you
say? And what part of Bantry Bay is the house you told
me of, that her nephew had? I looked in a map for Boat
of Garry, but could see nothing of it; I suppose it is a
small place."
So there was nothing further said about the advantages

219
of commerce over literature—or the reverse; and presently
Fitzgerald found himself being drawn by the humour of the
situation into giving Miss Patience such dark hints about
the ways and manners of the great politicians then in power
as would no doubt have astonished those much-canvassed
persons. Kitty seemed greatly relieved ; she listened
pleasantly; content reigned over the modest banquet.
And as for Fitzgerald, it was of little account to him what
nonsense he talked or listened to, so long as Kitty was in
the room. Miss Patience was treated with the gravest
respect; from time to time he could steal a glance at Kitty's
eyes.
The middle-day dinner was long over, and they had
gathered round the fire, when a step was heard on the
little pathway outside, and then a loud knock at the door.
Kitty started, and looked apprehensively at Miss Patience.
There was an absolute silence; then some sounds in the
passage ; and presently the maid-servant appeared.
“Mr. Cobbs, Miss."
Fitzgerald was fairly stupefied when he saw this young
man come into the room with the air of one who was
perfectly acquainted with both Kitty and Miss Patience.
He had never heard a word of him. Who could he be?
The next moment he found himself being introduced to
the stranger; and these two regarded each other with
scrutiny, though the new-comer had the advantage in calm-
ness. He took a chair ; put his hat and cane on the
table; and asked Kitty if she had been to church that
morning.
He was apparently about twenty or one-and-twenty;
stout, rather; of middle height; with a fair complexion and
close-cropped yellow hair; he was dressed in the extreme
of fashion; and his hands and feet were small. Anybody
else would have said he was an ordinary-looking, good-
looking, well-dressed young man—with perhaps too obvious
a taste for jewellery ; what Fitzgerald thought of him, and
of the circumstances, need not be put down here.
In truth, he was too bewildered to have any clear notion
of what he was thinking. But he knew that, whatever the
truth of the matter, he could not openly insult Kitty by

SHANDON BELLS
presuming that anything was wrong. He resolved to be
quite courteous to this stranger. Why should not an idle
young gentleman pay an afternoon call? He resolved to
be quite courteous; and clenched his hands behind his
back to keep him in remembrance.
Kitty, who appeared to have lost her usual self-confident,
half-satirical manner, seemed extraordinarily eager to get
these two to talk together. Mr. Fitzgerald had just come
over from London : had Mr. Cobbs been in London
recently ? Both seemed inclined to talk to her or to Miss
Patience, but not to each other; and the embarrassment of
the situation was obviously increasing when Fitzgerald
determined to end it. He saw his poor little sweetheart
frightened and troubled ; and he could not have that.
With much frankness he began to speak to this new-comer;
and as men find politics their common ground of conversa-
tion, he asked Mr. Cobbs if he had noticed any symptoms of
disaffection since his stay in the country. Now this was a
friendly overture ; but the young man with the fat fair face
and the blank gray eyes chose to be rather uncivil. He
began to say things about Ireland and the Irish—which was
not quite fair, seeing that there were three English people
to one Irishman. Moreover he talked the ordinary
nonsense that is talked by the well-fed, heavy-pursed
Englishman who lays down economical laws about Ireland
without any knowledge whatever of the people or of the
agricultural conditions of the country. And he was a
conceited creature; he liked to hear himself talk; his
platitudes were dictatorial in tone.
Fitzgerald was getting wilder and wilder; but he kept
his hands tightly clenched. And he would not answer this
fellow at all. He spoke to these other two. He told
them what he knew, what he had seen. He described the
haggard denizens of the bog-land, living amid ague and
starvation; he described the poor devils on the hillsides,
trying to scrape a living off rocky soil not fit to support
rabbits; and then, when the bit of sour bog-land had been
slowly reclaimed, or the potatoes beginning to do a little
better in the stone-walled enclosure, the agents stepping in
to demand impossible rents, and the landlord, in London,

or Venice, or Monaco, knowing nothing about it and caring
less; and then the eviction of whole families—the shivering
wretches without a bit of firewood, let alone a bit of bread.
And this was the system under which you hoped to get a
loyal and contented peasantry! With the mass of the
people believing that the landlords were leagued against
them; that the law was against them; that the soldiers
and the police were against them,
But indeed this is no place for a full exposition of the
picture that Fitzgerald drew : it is enough to say that a few
minutes had been sufficient to turn the Gallio whom the
priest had remonstrated with into a politician as violent as
the priest himself. Moreover, his vehement declarations
were now addressed to Kitty; and Kitty timidly assented.
She was staring into the fire; not at all in a contemplative
mood.
“But why don't they go away?” said Miss Patience.
“God help them, they are going away,” said he, “in
thousands, though there's many a breaking heart leaving
Queenstown Harbour. And it's the young ones that are
going; and the old ones, who can do nothing, are left at
home to starve."
“Well, if they can't earn a living they must suffer," said
the young Englishman. “If you can't live you must die
it's the law of nature. All I know of them is that they're
a set of mean snivelling wretches who will fawn upon you
if you give them charity, and shoot you from behind a
hedge the minute after."
“Only after you have given them charity? Then I
should say you were pretty safe !” was the somewhat too
fierce reply
Clearly the air was becoming surcharged ; and Miss
Patience prudently left the room. What astounded Fitz-
gerald, however, most of all was that this young stranger
seemed so much at home—so familiar with the apartment
and its contents, and so familiar in his manner with Kitty.
He sat down to the piano and opened it as if he had been
quite accustomed to do that. He overhauled the music
as if it were his own. And at last he said-as he carelessly
ran his fingers up and down the keys-


## p. 222 (#234) ############################################

222
SHANDON BELLS
“Won't you sing something, Miss Romayne, and let me
play the accompaniment? Oh, I know what will tempt
you.”
He rose and went to the other end of the room and
fetched a book of music back to the piano. He opened it ;
played a few bars, and then turned round.
"Won't that tempt you ?”
“I would rather not sing,” said Kitty, without looking
up.
“Really? Oh yes, come along !".
“ I would rather not sing,” said Kitty again.
He turned to Fitzgerald-his fingers still wandering
lightly over the keys.
“Do you play ?” said he.
The question was innocent enough; but Fitzgerald
considered it impertinent.
“No, I don't,” said he. “I don't consider it man's
work.”
“That is because you can't do it, I suppose," said the
other.
Now there was just a trifle too much of a sneer in this
little speech. Fitzgerald rose, and passed him on the
pretence of going to look out. As he passed he said, in a
low and clear voice-
“I can't play the piano; but I can throw puppies out
of the window."
Now whether this was meant exclusively for the young
gentleman's ear or not cannot be said ; but at all events, as
he happened to cease playing for a moment, it sounded so
distinctly that Kitty must have overheard it. Fitzgerald
walked on to the window; shoved his hands in his pockets,
and stared out. The young gentleman, after a second or two
of silence, rose from the piano; took his hat and cane;
and said to Kitty, with much formal politeness-
“Good afternoon, Miss Romayne. I shall do myself
the pleasure of calling some other time when you are not
occupied with visitors.”
He left.
“Who is that fellow ?" said Fitzgerald, turning angrily
from the window.

“What fellow ?” said Miss Romayne, with quite as much
temper. “He is a gentleman. You have no right to insult
him. He is as much entitled to civility in this house as you
are. You have no right to insult him. A pretty opinion
he will have taken away of you."
"I don't care about his opinion. I want to know what
he is doing here."
“He called, like yourself,” said she, stubbornly.
“Called ? Yes. And his calling has made your name
a byword !"
Her eyes flashed.
“Now I see! You have heard some miserable talking;
and that is why you have come over so suddenly. Well, I
am ready to be cross-examined. I will tell you what you
want to know—if that is your. purpose."
He looked at her; and knew her mood. It was not the
first of their quarrels.
“We will take it that way,” said he, coldly. “Who is
the young gentleman, if one may be permitted to ask ?”
“You have heard his name. He belongs to a firm of
merchants in Liverpool.”
“Oh, I perceive,” exclaimed Fitzgerald, a light breaking
in on him. “That accounts for the hymns of praise in
favour of commerce- "
“I did not say a word about it,” she said hotly. “If
you want to insult Miss Patience also, call her in. We
ought all of us to have a share of your politeness."
“But he is not looking after the machinery that turns
out two thousand pounds in a few hours. He is not tele-
graphing to Odessa from Cork, is he?”
“How can I tell ?”
“Do you know what he is doing in Cork ?"
“ He is travelling. He is on his way to Killarney."
“Killarney! Killarney at this time of the year! And
how long has he been in Cork on his way to Killarney ?”
“How can I tell ?”
“Some time, however ?”
“ Yes. Some time.”
“And he has called here several times ?”
"Yes, he has; what harm is there in that?”

“Oh, I did not say there was any harm- "
“But why are you talking to me like that?” said she,
and she threw the book she was holding on to the table. “I
will not be spoken to like that! I have done nothing
wrong. I will not be spoken to as if I were a child. It
is you who ought to apologise. You have insulted a friend
of mine under my own roof- "
“A friend ?" said he, in the same cold way. “Have
you come to that, then ? But I thought you were willing
to have a few questions asked, that was all.”
“Yes, I am," said she—though rather sullenly. “You
can find out what you like ; and then see whether you have
any right to come here with your insulting suspicions."
“ Have I mentioned any suspicions ?”
“ You would not be here if you did not suspect me."
“I would like to know a little more about this young
gentleman, Kitty."
“Very well."
“Where were you introduced to him — or were you
introduced to him at all ?”
“I was introduced to him," she said quickly, and with
her cheeks burning. “I was introduced to him in Dublin."
"In Dublin ! And so he has followed you all the way
from Dublin ?"
“How dare you say such a thing? He can travel
where he pleases; he is well off. He may be here on
business for anything I know."
“Oh no, Kitty, not on business; he is going to Killarney
in the middle of winter! And isn't it strange that, since
you've known him all the time since you were in Dublin,
you never thought of mentioning his name in any of your
letters to me?"
“I don't see anything strange in it,” she said pertly. “I
could not mention every trifle. I wrote of the things that
were of real interest to you and me.”
That phrase "you and me” rather softened him. His
anger and indignation were fast oozing away. It was so
pitiable to see Kitty standing before him there, with her
eyes cast down, like a culprit.
“I should have thought,” said he, in a more gentle way,

" I should have thought that anything that affected your
good name would be of interest to you and me."
"If — if anybody,” she said, with her lips becoming
tremulous, “has been saying anything—anything against
my good name, I did not expect it-it-it would be you,
Willie- "
And here she broke into a passion of tears; and threw
herself scbbing into his arms, and clung to him.
“Willie, there's nothing wrong ; I cannot bear to have
you speak like that to me. You break my heart. I would
rather die than have you angry with me. There was no-
thing wrong, Willie-there is no harm in anything I have
done-he-he is only a boy—and he was so good and
kind when—when they gave me a benefit—and everybody
spoke so well of him— "
“But why didn't you tell me all this before ?” said he.
“ It would only have worried you,” she sobbed. “You
were so far away. You could not understand. But now I
hate him for coming between you and me. Why should
he have caused such trouble? Nobody asked him to come
here "
“Well, Kitty," said he, taking her small head in his
hands in the old way and kissing her, “I think no harm
has been done; but you have been so imprudent-4"
“Oh, I will confess anything if only you speak to me like
that,” said she, gladly, as she looked up through her tears.
“There would have been no trouble if only you had
let me know. Of course, what I said about their taking
away your good name was perhaps too serious. They
have been talking though ; and I should not have heeded
one moment what they said if only I had known before-
hand-
"I am sure I don't care what they say,” said she, taking
his hand and kissing it, “so long as you don't quarrel with
me, Willie. And I ought to have known. Miss Patience
told me something like this would happen. 'But,' I said
to her, surely he can't object to any one paying us an after-
noon call; there's no harm in that.' And if you only knew
how lonesome it is for us two, Willie, sometimes, you would
understand how glad we were to have an occasional visitor.

Then he was very kind about the benefit; he took £20
worth of tickets—that was from me, not from the agents, so
we did not lose the commission; and I have saved so much
this winter that if it were only summer weather now I'd
treat you and me and Miss Patience to a trip to Killarney."
“Kitty," he said sharply, “that fellow is humbugging
you. He is not thinking of Killarney at all. He is
dawdling after you, and people have noticed it. Now, for
your own sake, and for mine—and for the sake of what has
been between us in bygone days—you will have to be a
little more—more circumspect, Kitty.”
“Oh,” said she, cheerfully, “I am willing to take any
amount of scolding—that way. If only you hold me in
your arms, you can scold away. And I believe it all then.
I believe I am very bad. Of course I don't believe it when
you provoke me and make me feel hurt and injured; then
it's you who are in the wrong. And now you know how to
make me do just as you like."
Making up a quarrel with Kitty was very nice; and it
generally lasted a good long time between these two. There
was a tap at the door.
.“Come in !” said Kitty, quickly putting a considerable
distance between them.
“Please, miss, Miss Patience wants to know when ye'd
be for having your tay."
“Oh, now, at once, tell her ;” and then she turned to
Fitzgerald : “And now, Master Willie, will you help me to
light the gas; and we will have the blind down; then tea;
then you shall read to us 'The Battle of Ivry ;' and it will
be all like old times again. How odd it is," she proceeded,
as she laid the cloth, “that we are always glad to have ,
something like something that has happened to us before.
I suppose in a year or two we shall be saying, “Come along
now and let us have tea snugly, like the old times, like the
Sunday after the quarrel.' And it will be better than if we
had nothing to look back to."
“And where will that tea take place, Kitty p" said he.
“Where, indeed ?” said she, cheerfully. “Who can
tell? I suppose in London.”
Miss Patience came in, looking rather frightened. But

she was greatly relieved to find that her two companions
were on excellent terms; indeed, when they all sat down
to the tea-table, she had to rebuke Kitty for facetiously
referring to Mr. Cobbs as the “fat boy.”
“He is in an important position,” said she, with some
dignity. “He has it in his power to do a great deal of
good. He can afford to be charitable. He has not to
think of himself.”
“That is fortunate, at least,” said Fitzgerald, ungener-
ously, "for he would have little to think of, and little to
do the thinking with. Now it seemed to me that he
thought a great deal of himself.”
“He is a very elegant-mannered young man,” said Miss
Patience with precision. “He is in an enviable situation
-free from care, and able to attend to others. The
country needs such persons; not adventurers who make
money out of their politics; but gentlemen-educated
gentlemen—who are above bribes, and can help to govern
the country disinterestedly. He belongs to the class of
men to whom we have to look for proper government- "
“God help us, then,” said Fitzgerald, inadvertently.
“And I am glad to say that his opinions on public
affairs- "
“His what?"
“His opinions,” repeated Miss Patience with dignity.
“Well, to call the ignorant prejudices of a conceited
young donkey like that, opinions, is, at all events, courteous.
But no harm is done by the existence of such creatures.
They go circling about the world, aimless, placeless, with
no more influence on real politics than the pointers and
setters of the United Kingdom. I daresay these young
gentlemen encourage the importation of third-rate cigars
from Havana; and they add greatly to the profits of the
producers of bad champagne; and so there is a kind of
reason for their existence.”
“He is a very nice boy; and I won't have such things
said about him," interposed Kitty ; but she was laughing,
for Miss Patience looked offended.
“One thing you can't help admiring about him,"
continued Fitzgerald, talking with familiar contempt about

Mr. Cobbs, as if he were some insect before them, “is his
forbearance. Just fancy! Most men who could make
£2000 in twenty-five minutes by remaining in Liverpool
would think twice before coming away over to Cork and
doing nothing. Look at that forbearance. He might
affect the currency by draining such masses of gold from
Odessa and elsewhere into England. Or is it his imagina-
tion that is most to be admired ?"
“Willie !" Kitty said reproachfully. “You seem to
have caught up the London way of believing in nothing."
“Oh no,” said he, “I am pursuing a philosophical
investigation. I want to know which part of his character
to admire the most. I think it must be imagination-or
prudence ?—he departed quickly."
“I thought he behaved very well; and you abominably,"
said Kitty with her accustomed frankness. “And you have
never yet apologised to me for your rudeness.”
“Well, I do now, Kitty. I shall never be so rude
again before you.”
She touched his hand beneath the table.
“You shall never have occasion again," said she in a
low voice.
It was a long afternoon and evening; but no afternoon
and evening was half long enough when he and Kitty were
together. And Miss Patience was kind ; she went away
occasionally-perhaps to her politics; leaving them to-
gether in the hushed warm little parlour, all thoughts of the
dark world of London shut out, and only present to them
the memories of summer rambles and of moonlight walks
along the coast at Inisheen. Kitty was as pleased, and
pretty, and fascinating as ever; you would not have
thought that, but a few hours before, she had been standing
opposite him with her eyes flashing and her cheeks pale
with anger. She was now so gentle, so winning; the touch
of her warm little hand was soft as velvet.
“And must you really go away again to-morrow, Willie?”
she said—she was seated on the hearthrug before the fire,
her head just touching his knee.
“I must indeed. I wrote to Mrs. Chetwynd begging
her to let me off to-morrow night; and to-morrow night I

shall be neither there nor here, but on the wide sea that
separates us, Kitty.”
“It is such a long journey to take for merely a little
talk like this.”
“For more than that, Kitty."
She blushed somewhat, but said nothing.
“I am coming to the station to see you off, to-morrow,"
said she, at length.
“Would you ?" said he, with great delight. “Would
you take the trouble ?”.
“The trouble !” she exclaimed. “And I am going to
do more than that, if you will let me. I want to get a
proper kind of luncheon for you in a little basket; because
-because it is a woman's place to provide such things''
said Kitty, with a trifle of self-conscious pride. “And I
know what you men do; you stuff a lot of sandwiches into
a piece of paper, and take them out and eat them when
they are like leather.”
“Not I,” said he. “I have had a warning. An
Academician's wife told me that sandwiches were most
pernicious.”
“An Academician's wife !” said Kitty. “And yet you
deny you go out among those great ladies in London !
Why don't you make haste, and make me a great lady,
and take me about with you, instead of gallivanting about
by yourself?"
“Am I not making haste, Kitty?”
“Yes; sitting by a fire in Audley Place, and letting me
stroke your hand, while you ought to be fighting tooth and
nail in London, with all your armour on, careering every-
thing down before you.”
“If it was that kind of fighting, Kitty, perhaps it would
be easier," said he, absently; for he was thinking of the
lonely room to which he was returning, with no Kitty to sit
by him on the hearthrug, and stir the fire when it was
getting low.
Next morning he thought she had forgotten her promise ;
for it was near the time of starting, and yet no Kitty had
put in an appearance. Then he saw her come quickly
along, alonę; and she was breathless when she reached him.

“Oh, Willie, I thought I was too late; but here is the
basket; and if the pie is a little warm still, it will be cold
by the time you want it. I made it myself,” she said, with
a laugh and a blush, “last night after you were gone--"
“Last night !” he said. “After twelve ?"
“What was that compared to your comfort ?" said she,
boldly. “And I thought you would like to know that
my hands could do something besides — besides kissing a
good-bye to you. And I was up this morning by six to
get it in the oven. Oh, Willie, I have had so little time,”
she added breathlessly, “I could not quite get all the
sawdust off the grapes—so be a little careful- "
“Oh, never mind these things,” said he—for the guard
was impatient. “But it is so kind of you, Kitty. You are
always kind. And now I am going away again—who
knows for how long ?”
“ That depends on you,” she said, with a smile; and
she kissed him; and she kept waving her handkerchief
until the train was quite out of sight.
He was alone in the carriage ; and he was gazing out
of the window, seeing nothing. His whole visit this time
had been so rapid and so strange. And he was so glad
to take away with him the renewed assurance of Kitty's
faith and constancy and love, that he could scarcely admit
to himself the presence of a vague impression that it was
now become more urgent than ever that he should seek to
win his way in London.
The day wore on with these imaginings, until at last the
base claims of hunger reminded him that he had been so
ungrateful as to forget all about Kitty's parting gift. You
may imagine the interest and delight with which he opened
the pretty little basket, and bethought him of how Kitty's
own fingers had placed such and such things there for him.
Indeed a woman's hand was visible everywhere in the neat-
ness with which everything was wrapped up and arranged.
There was a small table-napkin, as white as snow. The
knife and fork and spoon were all brilliant; and there was
a tiny tumbler along with the half-bottle of claret. There
was the pie that she had waited up in the night-time to
make for him; and had she dressed the salad too? He

could see no sawdust at all on the bunch of grapes. And
then his eyes and thoughts wandered away altogether from
the materials of the little banquet; and he thought what a
pretty housewife Kitty would make, filling the rooms with
light, and singing, and hurrying up everybody in her fear-
less, independent way. And the rooms through which he
saw her moving were the rooms of the little green and
white house at Chelsea.
He had a beautiful night for crossing. The stars were
extraordinarily brilliant. As the huge ship ploughed her way
through the black waves, all the interest of the night was
centred in the clear dome above, where the myriad eyes
throbbed or gazed steadily. There was the resplendent
Jupiter, not far from the misty Pleiades; Mars was un-
usually high in the heavens; Orion's jewels flashed; the
great world above was lit with a million fires, while the one
below was but a mournful sound of unseen water. And
perhaps this young fellow sitting there on deck in the cold
night (with his heart very warm with love) may have laughed
to himself when he imagined what the scientific folk who
came to Hyde Park Gardens would think of his way of
looking at the stars. He had no anxiety to know whether
there was any chloride of sodium in them. When he
regarded their brilliancy, he thought of Kitty's eyes; their
patient reappearance night after night, year after year, only
reminded him of Kitty's faithfulness; and the far-reaching
and luminous heavens themselves seemed really to belong
to Inisheen, and to him, and to her, and to their secret
walks along the shores in the nights gone by.

CHAPTER XIX.
A PROSPECT.
The first thing that Fitzgerald did on returning to London
was to hunt up Andy the Hopper, and transfer him from
Limehouse to the Fulham Road; and during these next
few days, while Andy hung about and acted as general
servant as well as he could, and while John Ross and his
neighbour made successive experiments with the wild-fowl
and game that had come from the south of Ireland, things
went cheerfully enough. The woodcock were Inisheen
woodcock; and he was proud that Ross approved of them
highly. Then he took Andy to see one or two of the
sights of London; but Andy was somewhat of a failure.
He merely gaped. Fitzgerald (so desperate was his need)
thought he might induce some editor to accept a paper
descriptive of a wild Irishman's first impressions of the
great city; but he could not make much out of the staring
eyes, the open mouth, and the occasional muttered exclama-
tion which were the only evidences of Andy's amazement.
At last, when Andy was going away, Fitzgerald said to
him—
“ Look here, Andy, I have a word for you."
“Av ye plase, sir.”
“You may as well know that I am going to marry the
young lady who was at Inisheen that time you remember.”
“Baithershins, Masther Willie !" exclaimed Andy, with a
vast and capacious grin. “'Twas the divil's own diversion
for ye to go sporting about with the gyurl, and then to go
and lave her like that--"

“Hold your tongue or I'll pitch you down the stair,"
said Fitzgerald, angrily; and Andy's face changed instantly,
for he perceived that this was no joke at all.
“Is it thrue, Masther Willie ?” said he, with great
concern.
“It is true. She is going to be my wife; now you
know."
“'Tis the proud gyurl she'll be, thin!” said Andy. “Oh,
didn't I suspect that same now, for all the jokin'? 'Şure,'I
said, "Masther Willie wouldn't be afther takin' the throuble
to walk about wid the English young lady if 'twasn't a
coortin'?' Oh, the beautiful young crayture now ! Sure
a purtier young lady ye wouldn't find betwixt the Black-
water and the Shannon. She's the flower o' faymales, and
that's thrue.”
“The what ?"
Andy glanced at the young master anxiously.
“'Tis what they say in poethry,” said he, with some
hesitation.
“Well, attend to me, Andy. There has been some
gossiping going on in Inisheen, I gather. Well, now,
attend to this : the first that you hear say anything about
that young lady, you take your hopping-pole and lay it
over his head. Do you understand that now ?”.
“Faix, it might be my own head I'd have to break,
thin,” said Andy. “For wasn't it mesilf that brought the
story of what Corney Malone—the divil sweep him !-was
saying? But sure, Masther Willie, when they know you're
going to marry the young lady—the beautiful crayture she
is !-do ye think they'd be afther saying anything more?"
Then Andy, after a second, added valiantly : “No matter,
Masther Willie ; if the laping-pole will do, 'tis at your
sarvice; and divil the man or boy in Inisheen has a head
so thick that it won't break-glory be to God!"
But Fitzgerald also knew that there would be no more
gossiping after this authoritative announcement: and why
should it not be known that he was going to marry Kitty ?
So Andy went away back to Ireland ; and the days
passed; and spring came in mild and humid weather to
Chelsea ; and the old hard fight was continued, now with

illusive hopes, now with keen disappointments, always with
a terrible anxiety. For that was what he had definitely
brought away with him from Cork; a haunting conscious-
ness that it was necessary he should get on at once. And
how could he bring editors to understand that? They
knew nothing about Inisheen. They would keep his MSS.
for indefinite periods; sometimes lose them; sometimes
return them after the subject of which they treated had
passed from the public mind. For Fitzgerald, having
brought his burlesque of pot-house politics to an end, had
begun to try his hand at real politics; but the difficulty
was to get an opening for these carefully-prepared articles
of his. More than once the conductor of a journal took
the trouble to write to him, in returning one of these, to
explain that he approved of it, and might have used it in
his paper, but that all such subjects were treated by the
regular members of his staff, which at the moment was full.
Fitzgerald found most encouragement from the projectors
of new magazines, who were prepared to put him on their
staff at once; but as his payment in most cases was to be
contingent on some future share of profits, the arrangement
did not seem satisfactory. By some extraordinary chance,
which he himself could scarcely understand, he got one
article inserted in the monthly magazine which at that time
was far and away ahead of all its fellows; and as his name
was attached, he had at least the pride of sending it to
Kitty. But his subsequent efforts in that direction only
resulted in heartrending delay and disappointment. In
short, he had to learn, as many an unfortunate wretch has
had to learn and will have to learn, that fugitive writing of
this kind is valueless as a means of living.
“Ye are trying too much, laddie,” said John Ross to -
him, one evening, when they were having a smoke together
in the hollow-sounding studio. “Ye are writing about
everything in the universe. Is it politics or leeterature
ye're after?"
“I don't know," said Fitzgerald. “What I do know is
that I ought to have been learning shorthand when I was
shooting snipe. Then I could have got on in newspaper
work by the usual stages. Now I can't get my foot on the

first rung of the ladder-unless it's the treadmill: that's
the only occupation in this country that you can get hold
of without any introduction or training. Oh, of course,
what I should like would be literature,” he added, remem-
bering the dreams with which he had set out for London.
“But I don't see any permanent work in that; what they
seem to like best is my verses; and these you can't
manufacture at will. I have once or twice tried writing a
novel; that is no use; I found myself imitating somebody
else in spite of myself. No, the only constant occupation
for a writing man I see is newspaper work, and all the
newspaper-offices are full. Never mind,” said he, cheer-
fully, as he struck another match, “I can live. I can
always earn my living as a gamekeeper. Perhaps it was
too cheeky of me to come away from Cork and attempt to
fight my way single-handed in London literature. I had
no introductions; no influence. I got some help at the
beginning ; but I had to pay for that pretty heavily. Well,
I have not quite given in yet. I mean still to try for a
time. And then if I am beaten—well, I shall have had
the experience; that is something."
He had been talking very contentedly and even cheer-
fully ; but now a slight shadow seemed to come over the
square forehead and the clear and thoughtful eyes.
“Life would be a simple matter — it would be easy
enough,” said he, “if one had only oneself to consider.
But it is different when you have to ask some one else for
the sacrifice of expectations."
Ross glanced at him.
“That depends on the young lass herself,” said he,
" that depends on what she is like."
Fitzgerald was too deeply occupied to resent the imputa-
tion or inference.
“Ross,” said he, eagerly, “you've never told me what
you think about women. You've talked about everything
else in the world, I believe, except that.”
The other laughed.
“ What I think about women ?" said he. “The laddie's
cracked. What chance has any man o' forming a judg-
ment on the half o' the human race? Ye may get to know.

two women, or three women, or may be even half-a-dozen
women, in the whole course of your life ; and ye're well off
if they happen to be decent sort o' creatures, for it's from
them ye are likely to form your opeenion o' the whole lot.”
“You remember me telling you about Hilton Clarke ?"
“I remember the meeserable wretch,” said Ross, plainly.
“Oh, but I bear him no grudge,” said Fitzgerald. “At
least, not for the money part of the business. I don't
believe he meant to swindle anybody. It was merely that
he was lacking in a kind of sixth sense that keeps most
people straight about money. I daresay, if he had money
to-morrow, and I wanted it, he would let me have it."
"I daresay he would do nothing of the kind,” said Ross,
severely. “And the sixth sense ye speak of-do ye mean
coinmon honesty ?”
“Well, it isn't that that I remember against him; but
he had a most pernicious habit of putting things into your
head "
“Put them out again, then, for God's sake. Would ye
listen to the teaching of a man like that?”
“But it is not so easy to put them out. You keep
asking yourself whether his theories are true or not; and
then life is so much of a mystery; and people who are
older than you yourself are must have had so much more
experience of human nature- ".
“That ye should believe them? No. I say no !” John
Ross said ; and whatever he did say he said emphatically,
even if it involved the knocking off the head of his pipe.
“I say no. I say, ask first of all with what sort of spec-
tacles they have been looking at human nature.”
“For example,” said Fitzgerald—but why did he avert
his eyes, and pretend to be busy with the stove, to hide
his shamefacedness ?—"he had a theory, or a conviction
rather, that there were many women who were really too
affectionate—too kind and generous—who could not help
falling in love with anybody who was near them. He said
they would keep quite faithful and true so long as you were
beside them ; but in absence they could not help letting
their tenderness of heart begin to suggest possibilities :
until, perhaps before they quite knew themselves, they

grew fonder and fonder of the new-comer; and then you
see, what the world would call the breaking of a troth,
heartlessness, or something like that, had really come
about because the woman had too much kindness and
affection in her nature "
“What kind of a woman do ye call that?” said Ross,
with harsh contempt. “What kind of affection do ye call
that? I call it the affection that exists between rabbits.
God be thanked, that's no the kind o women I have
met- "
“Then you don't think there are such women?” said Fitz-
gerald, eagerly, and he raised his head at last. “Women
whose excess of kindness would always be keeping one in
anxiety? You think that was merely a fantastic theory ?"
“I mind one poor lass,” said Ross, absently, “that had
too much love in her heart; but that was not the way it
went. A winsome bit lassie she was; so jimp and neat
and blithe; and I think half the laddies in the school
where I was at Beith were head over ears in love with her;
and mony's the sair fight there was amongst us about her.
She was to be married to a young fellow—a sailor-lad he
was, I think, though she was but sixteen or seventeen; and
what must he do one night at Greenock but get fuddled
and go out capering in a boat in one of the docks and get
drowned in the dark. The poor lass never held up her
head. She had some money, too; for her father had left
her some bits of cottages at Beith; and many a one came
after her; but she had not a word for any of them. She
just dwindled away—though she had been as healthy a lass
as any in the parish; and in three or four years' time they
put her in the kirkyaird ; and though folk say that nobody
ever dies o' a broken heart, I do not know what else it was
that Jean Shaw died o'. Ay, that was one. Then there
were two more-I may say three- that never married
because they could not get the man they wanted. · That's
four—a good number in one man's experience. Oh, but
I've known the other side, too—young lasses changing
their mind-giddy creatures, for the most part, wanting to
cut a dash with more money than their first sweetheart
had. And there's one,” said he, with a grim smile, “that

I would like to know more about now. She was in a place
in Glasgow-I mean she was a servant-lass—and her sweet-
heart was a working plumber—a roaring, swearing, drunken
sort o’ fellow. Then she must needs take up with some
shopkeeper-laddie, as being more genteel, d’ye see? and
there was some quarrelling until the plumber got hold o'
the young fellow, and smashed him almost into bits. That
was a seven years' business for him. So as soon as he was
safe out o' the way, she married the shopkeeper; and no
doubt everything went well until the seven years began to
come down to six and five and four and three. The last
I heard was that the husband and wife were living in daily
fear o' their lives; for the plumber was soon to be out;
and he had sworn to murder the pair o'them. Man,"
said Ross, bringing down his fist on his knee, “why dinna
you leeterary people go where ye can see human passion in
the rough, where ye can see the real tragedy of life? That
is no among the fine people— the nobeelity; for there
money lets an ill-assorted couple go different ways; and at
the worst, if the wife goes to the bad, the husband is too
much of a philosopher to bother himself into a rage about
it, for he has run through all the experiences of life long
before he ever got married. And it's no among the middle
classes; they are too well-conducted and circumspect; they
fear the talk o' their church-going and chapel-going neigh-
bours. No, it's among the lower, or even the lowest
classes, that the passions are simple and intense. When
the woman is faithless, the man murders her, or tries to,
regardless of consequences. Starvation, the madness o
drink, the pitiableness of the weak, the fight for bread-
these are the things that show ye what the struggles, the
passions, the bigness, the littleness o' human nature are.
Leave your books, man, and get out to Bermondsey, -or
Spitalfields, or Shadwell, and study the men and women
there-
“Oh, I am not a dramatist,” said Fitzgerald. “Beşides,
I think you are quite mistaken.” Ross was continually
dogmatising about his own profession; why should not he
about his? “You may find brute force there, and violent
jealousy; anything else you must take with you. And

when you begin planting your literary theories--your noble
sentiments, that are the product of refinement–into that
coarse soil, the crop is merely affectation. The bully who
suddenly bursts out crying when he hears a canary is a mere
sham—unless he is drunk, when he would probably get up
and strangle the canary. Passion in the rough?— Yes, the
rough sometimes has a good deal of passion—when he
kicks his mother. Thank you; but before I go and try to
paint a picture of the costermonger—with a pewter pot in
his hand, and love and innocence in his heart-I shall wait
to see what effect a course of lectures on limelight will have
on him."
Ross regarded him for a second.
“Ye're a deep young fellow," he said, "for all your
frank face. Or is it pride ? I'm afraid the young lady up
there and you don't get on very well together.”
« Oh, I think she means to be very civil to me. I
think, from little suggestions, that she has been talking to
her aunt about sending me over as bailiff to an estate they
have at Bantry. Well, I don't wonder at it. My present
post is rather too much of a sinecure.”
“Other people manage to live on sinecures happily
eneuch,” said Ross, bluntly; “I wish to heaven I had half-
a-dizzen o' them !”
"And then,” continued Fitzgerald, with some tell-tale
colour in his face, “the other people about that house are all
such hard-working people—I mean those you sometimes
meet by chance that one feels such an idler. I do
believe at this minute,” he said in desperation, “if they
were to give me a decent salary as bailiff at that farm, I'd
take it and have done with literature. I can enjoy litera-
ture without trying to make any; and I should be in my
own element over there. But what were we talking
about ?” He pretended to make a cast back. “Oh yes;
about Hilton Clarke's theories about women. Well, here
are other two women—these Chetwynds—who, I am sure,
are perfectly honest and upright and believable. My
experience has not been very great ; I can scarcely
remember my mother; and I had no sisters. But most
of the women I have been more or less acquainted with,

have been, as it seemed to me, a good deal better and
more honest and more unselfish than the men ; and—and
in short you wouldn't be inclined to doubt your own
experiences even when a man who has seen more of the
world than you have, tries to make you less believing?"
“I would send him to the devil !” said Ross, decisively.
“Believe in the honesty of men and women, and in the
wise providence and justice o' things as long as ye can;
and when ye cannot, put it down to your personal bad
luck, and dinna accuse everybody of stealing because here
or there some one has robbed ye. The truth is, ye are
anxious about that young lass in Ireland.”
Fitzgerald started, and was inclined to be angry. But
what was the use ? His friend had guessed the truth,
much as Fitzgerald had tried to conceal it from him and
also from himself. Yes; he was anxious; it had come to
that.
“ Is she a braw lass ?”.
“I think you mean handsome? No, she is not impos.
ing, if that is what you mean. But she is exceedingly
pretty. I can talk to you about her with impunity; for
you don't know her name. She is very pretty, and very
winning and tender-hearted, and clever too. Think of her
being content to wait on and on like this, while I am
floundering about without any certain prospects whatever.”
“ Content to wait !” exclaimed Ross. “Goodness me,
what would be the worth of her if she were not content to
wait? A fine kind of lass to have that would be. And
ye have two pounds a week as a certainty, with constant
small addeetions? Get her over, man, and marry her!
Two pounds a week! The great majority of the human
race live on far less; and what is good for the muckle
is no' bad for the pickle."
This bold and sudden challenge startled him ; but was
not the wild project as beautiful as it was wild? The
thought of it! What if Kitty were really to consent?
They could take a couple of small rooms somewhere, and
work and wait in patience with love and blessed content
their constant companions-until the happier time came.

well with them, to be able to talk of their early struggle
and of their adventures and their fears and hopes ? Kitty's
letters had not been very cheerful of late : might not this
sudden challenge deliver her from the bond of despondency?
But he dared not make so fateful a proposal without
much anxious care; and as it turned out, on the very next
evening, something happened that promised to aid him
most materially. When he had got through his appointed
hour, and had risen to leave, Mrs. Chetwynd said to him
-obviously with a little embarrassment-
“Mr. Fitzgerald, I–I want to explain something. You
know you are on such friendly terms with us—at least
I hope so—I hope you feel quite at home in the house-it
is rather difficult to speak about money matters. But they
have to be spoken about; for every one must live, I sup-
pose. And—and, in fact-Mary was saying that a great deal
more of your time was being occupied than appeared to
be the case ”
“Oh, I hope you won't speak of it," said he. “My
time is not so valuable.”
“Everybody's time is valuable," said the old lady, with
a smile, "for it is easy to make it so. Mary was saying
you must spend a great deal of time in looking over these
new books-
“ That is a pleasure to myself.”
“Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, is it fair? I have a frightful
task to get through with, and you won't let me alone. If
Mr. Scobell were in England, I should have asked him.
However, here is the truth; that my conscience won't
allow me to occupy so much of your time on the present
terms; and I propose to make a difference. If,” said she,
rather hesitatingly, “if you would kindly take that envelope
with you, you will find in it the arrears—a small sum, but
my conscience will be clear—and now, not another word
– for I've got through with it, and I am quite happy.
Now, good-night, and not a word.”
“Not of thanks ?” said he.
“No; good-night; go away,” said the old lady, with a
light little laugh; she was clearly very well pleased to have
got it over.

In this open and unaddressed envelope he had found a
cheque, drawn out in Mary Chetwynd's clear and precise
hand, and signed by her aunt, for £65. The rapidest of
calculations showed him what this meant. He was to
have two hundred a year, then, instead of one ? The
vision that this opened up left no room for those over-
sensitive perplexities that he had laid before his friend
Ross. His heart was beating too quickly. The question
was, what arguments, what entreaties, what pretty phrases
would bring Kitty to him from over the sea.
He walked rapidly, he knew not whither. The darkness
was pleasant. Never had he struggled so with the com-
position of any leading article affecting the interests of
India, or China, or Peru. He tried to meet beforehand
every possible objection. He thought of all the nice
things he could say to win her consent. At what hour he
got home to his lodgings he did not quite know; but that
important letter was yet far from being arranged.
It took him, indeed, the whole night to write it ; de-
stroying numberless copies that seemed to him to leave a
loophole of escape here or there. He felt that Kitty's
letters had been somewhat cold and matter-of-fact of late ;
he was afraid she might judge this one coldly; he had to
make everything safe, so that she should feel the future
was absolutely secure. And when at last he did go out to
post this letter at the nearest pillar letter-box, behold !
the wan gray light of daybreak was stealing over the skies,
and far away there was the rumble of the first of the carts.
I do not know who was the Postmaster-General at that
precise time; but have no doubt that when Fitzgerald
dropped the heavy letter under the metal lid, he was as
impatient with him as Juliet was with her nurse.
“ Love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over low'ring hills :

slowly spreading abroad its beams; and the world of
London was awaking. Fitzgerald was in no humour for
sleep; he thought he would rather go away down to the
river, to have a look at a little green and white house there;
and there was a light as of the dawn on his face.

CHAPTER XX.
SOME CORRESPONDENCE.
YES; there was no doubt of it; during the months that
had elapsed since his hurried visit to Cork, Kitty's letters
had grown much more cold, or, at least, much more
reserved and matter-of-fact; while now and again there was
a tone of disappointment running through them which he
had striven to overlook at the moment. Now, as he
re-read them, with this glorious prospect—this near and
shining future—before him, he sought for reasonable
explanations and excuses, and easily found them. The
spring had been wet and boisterous; and Kitty's spirits
were readily affected by the weather and its discomforts.
Then she had had a good deal of travelling; and that
would account for the curtness of some of the notes, Kitty
being ordinarily a most profuse letter-writer. And then
again the news that he had had it in his power to send her
was not of the most cheering description—though he had
tried to put the best face possible on matters. Altogether,
looking over these letters again, and regarding them by this
new light, he could find nothing disquieting in them; on
the contrary, they were quite natural in the circumstances :
the question was how would Kitty write now?
He could not doubt how she would answer his appeal.
The summer was coming on, with all its beautiful new
hopes, new desires, new possibilities. During that winter,
Kitty had again and again, and not at all to his sorrow,
pretty plainly hinted that she was dissatisfied with her
present way of living. It had become distressingly mono-

tonous. There were no ambitious hopes to lure her on.
Only once had she expressed herself as being pleased with
her surroundings ; and that was on a professional visit to
Dublin, where, instead of having to go to the usual lodgings,
she had been the guest, along with Miss Patience, of the
wife of the manager of a theatre there ; and that lady
had introduced Kitty to a number of people, and made
her life a little more cheerful for her for a time. Then
she had to return to the provinces; and to miserable
rooms; and the fatigues of travelling; and, as the weather
happened to be exceptionally bad, it was no wonder she
should grow tired or even querulous at times. And when
people are disheartened, they do not write long and play-
ful letters, full of pretty sentiment and pleasant humour.
How could Kitty be cheerful and amusing with her fingers
benumbed with the cold, her feet wet, and adverse winds
blowing the smoke down the chimney ?
But now all this would be altered. There would be no
more need for letters; Kitty herself would be there to talk
to, to talk, and submit to be teased. And what happy ex-
cursions would there be on the clear summer mornings,
wandering about Chelsea to fix on their future and
permanent home. As for himself, he would not choose,
even in imagination, until Kitty should come over. She
ought to have her share of the responsibility. And what
her eyes approved, he did not think he should find much
fault with.
That anxiously awaited letter was a long while in com-
ing; many and many a time, when he heard the postman
ascending the stair outside, had his heart beat quick only
to be disappointed. But at last it came; and to his
astonishment he found on the back of the envelope the
name of a Killarney hotel. He hastily opened it—the
letter was written on hotel paper - in fact there was an
engraving of Lough Leane at the head of the page! How
had Kitty got there? She had not said a word of any
such intention !
Breathlessly he ran his eyes over the various sheets
for this time Kitty had written at length—hoping to find
some phrase decisive of her reply. She had got his letter

evidently; but nowhere was there any positive acquiescence
or positive refusal so far as he could gather from that
hurried and uncertain glance. And so—with more dread
of disappointment than actual disappointment—and still
with some trembling hope—he forced himself to read the
letter systematically through.
“MY DEAR WILLIE—Your letter has followed me here;
and I will never forgive you for not having driven me to go
to Killarney many a day ago. I suppose it was all because
of your jealousy; you wanted to bring me here yourself;
as if the place belonged to you! And the idea of my
having been many a time at Limerick, and Mallow, and
Cork; the idea of my having had to sing the Killarney
song in the panorama ; without even having been to this
Paradise! I suppose I thought it was too familiar,
because I knew all the places in the photographs in the
windows; but neither they, nor the panorama, nor any-
thing else, could have told me of the charm of this beautiful
neighbourhood. We were out last night in a boat; there
was no moon; but the stars were lovely. We rowed to
Innisfallen; and I sung one or two songs—the sound was
so strange when we got near the island ; I was wondering
whether the ghosts in the Abbey would hear. What a
beautiful night it was.
“Of course you are asking what brought me here.
Well, dear Willie, I have had a great deal of bother, and
soine hard work of late ; and I thought I had earned a
little holiday; and everybody said we ought to go to
Killarney in the spring; and Miss Patience and I have
done it as cheaply as we could. Where in the world could
we have come to for such perfect peace and rest? This
hotel is nearly empty; when we went to Muckross Abbey
and the Torc Cascade and all round there, we were quite
by ourselves; and when we go out on the lake there are
no tourists anywhere. The day we arrived, however, there
was a fearful tempest. I said to myself, Goodness gracious,
is this Killarney? I thought Killarney was always quite
still, with moonlight on it (as it was in the panorama).
The wind and the rain were dreadful; the mountains

were quite black except when the clouds crossed and hid
them; and the waves on the lake smashed on the rocks at
Innisfallen and sprung up in foam just like the sea. But
now everything is quiet and lovely ; and I feel as if this
was the Vale of Avoca that I should like to rest in, with
the friends I love best ; only I suppose there never is rest
like that for everybody; trouble is the policeman that steps
in and orders you to move on.
“Dear Willie, I feel quite afraid to begin and try to
answer your letter; for I know you won't understand what
I mean about it. I entirely agree with you about a private
life—it has been the wish of my heart for many a day; I
an quite tired of the annoyances of my public one. People
think it is a fine easy thing to earn your living by merely
singing songs; I wish they knew what hard work and
uncertain work it is. Of course, one's vanity is pleased
sometimes, when you have nice things said to you, or when
the audience is very enthusiastic; but what a temporary
thing that is! When I stayed with Mrs. Milroy in Dublin
I was quite delighted with the little occupations and visits
and amusements with which they passed the time; and I
know that would suit me; and as for your suggestion that
I might some day regret giving up this kind of life, you
might have saved yourself all the arguing against it; it is the
last thing, I know, that will ever occur to me; and I should
be ready this minute to give it up, if I could do so safely.
“People never do get what they want, I suppose; and
I suppose it is better for them in the long run. And for
you to think, just now, when you are making a path for
yourself that will lead to future fame, of hampering yourself
in the way you propose — well, I can understand your
dreaming of it, for you were always so romantic and strange
in your notions, but I have got worldly wisdom enough for
both of us, and I can see what a pity it would be. When
you want a clear way for your genius, you tie all this
domestic anxiety round your neck! Consider how pre-
carious you would be. That old lady might die at any
moment, and then ! I am afraid, dear Willie, that your
literary prospects by themselves wouldn't warrant you in
doing as you propose ; and do you know I, for one, am

not so sorry there should be such difficulty and hard work,
for if there was not, wouldn't everybody be at it, and where
would be the glory of making a name for yourself, if every-
body could step in and do it? I know you distrust your
powers; I don't; and I should think myself mean and
unscrupulous if I allowed my private wishes to interfere
with your future. I know some day you will have reason
to thank me. Was it not me who sent you away from that
miserable little office in Cork to take the place that your
genius entitles you to ? I as good as said-
• Go where glory waits thee,
But while Fame elates thee,
Oh! still remember me !
When the praise thou meetest
To thine ear is sweetest,
Oh! then remember me !'
I know you always laugh at my poetry; but I like poetry
that one can understand, that has common sense in it; and
there is common sense in that. I expect great things of
you; and so would the world if it knew as much as I did;
and it seems to me that, with gifts such as yours, you have
no right to throw up your career, or at least seriously
hamper it, for the mere gratification of a piece of romance.
But that was always like you, Willie. You look at things
in such a strange way. You don't seem to value things as
other people do; and you don't appear to consider it is
your duty to get on in the world, and make money, and a
security for your old age. I have seen a good deal of the
world ; I have seen what money can do; what good you
can do with it; how independent it makes you. I believe
if it had not been for me, you would have kept on in Cork,
simply because you had the chance of living a half-sailor,
half-gamekeeper life at Inisheen; and you would never
have thought of the time when you would no longer be able
to go after rock-pigeons. And so, dear Willie, you must
try and be a little less romantic in the meantime; and do
justice to the gifts you have; and by-and-by you will thank
me, and say that everything has been for the best.
“Now I know you have quite misunderstood me; and
you are angry, in your wild way, and accuse me of being

mercenary-me! I have never had enough money to
know what mercenariness was—and of course you are im-
patient that everything can't come about just as if it were
a story-book. Alas! I wish it could ; and everybody be
satisfied; but there is always trouble, even to those who
make the strongest fight against the inclinations of their
heart, and try to do what is best for every one around them,
Just imagine me lecturing you like this ! And yet you
know, dear Willie, that.you are too poetical; and so I must
be the commonplace person—even here, with Killarney
before me. There was a dreadful accident to the coach as
we were coming. There is a steep hill some miles before
you get here, and one of the two horses fell, and the force
of the coach dragged it along, and the poor beast's knees
were horrible to look at. It just managed to walk the dis-
tance; though I thought every moment it would go down.
But what a fine thing it must be to have a carriage and
one's own horses, and drive all through these beautiful
places quite at your leisure, and without a thought for the
future. Just fancy not having to care a farthing whether
June or August is near or far off; nothing but to enjoy the
present moment; and drive from one hotel to another,
irrespective of time and without a thought about the cost.
I think people who can have such happiness to themselves
ought to be very kind to other people. I know I should
try to be. I can imagine myself driving through the country
like that; and if there was any trouble, it would be the
thought that I could not make all the poor people one
might meet just as contented as oneself. One might meet,
who knows, some young fellow going away from his sweet-
heart, forced by fate, and very much troubled about his
prospects; and a letter of introduction or something might
save misery. But these are all idle dreams; and one must
take the world as it is.
"I am so glad that that kind old lady has again be-
friended you; and hope that something substantial and
permanent may come of her friendship for you; but even if
these hopes are disappointed, I am convinced you did right
in going away to London. Genius such as yours is a trust.
You had no right to waste your time fishing and boating

and shooting. Even if it were to be decided by fate that
you and I were never to meet again, do you not think I
should watch your career, of which I am far more certain
than you are? Of course, I don't say that success is to
come all at once. I do believe you are working your best;
though I don't think from what you say that that Scotch
artist-I thought the Scotch were so practical !-does you
any good. I suppose he thinks it would be romantic to
live in a garret; and if I was a bare foot lassie, perhaps it
would ; but now again you will accuse me of mercenariness
just because I have to talk common sense. I don't believe
there's anybody in the world cares less for money than I do;
but I see what money can do, and how it gives people time
to be thoughtful and kind to those around them; and in any
case I am not going to be the one to wreck such a career
as you have before you, Scotchman or no Scotchman.
"I have been so much occupied here that I forget
whether I thanked you for the volume of political speeches
that you sent Miss Patience; but at all events I was asked,
and intended to do so, with her best compliments. The
book seems to be highly appreciated ; she has scarcely
stirred out since we came here. As for our stay here, that
is quite uncertain ; but I am in love with the scenery (it is
far prettier and not as grand or wild as I expected, and you
know I prefer quietness to Alpine terrors), and I shall tear
myself away with great regret. We make our way on to
Limerick, where I have four concerts—the old mill-wheel
again after this Paradise. So, dear Willie, you need not
write here if you are writing, but to the post office, Limerick,
and I shall expect a letter saying that you know I am acting
in the best kindness, and laying myself open to the charge
of being a money-grasping young woman (which is absurd,
you know, for if I was, where is there any to grasp ?) when
all I want is to act prudently for you and me. Good-bye,
dear Willie, if there's any one wishes you a speedily secure
position and great fame and reputation such as you deserve,
there's no one wishes that more heartily than
“Your affectionate KITTY.

does read so business-like that I am ashamed of it; and
yet I can't burn it, and have to go over all the arguments
again. It quite wore out my small brain last night ; and
there were such difficulties too—such interruptions—that it
seems all confused. I meant it to be so kind ; and it reads
like a school-book. Never mind, Willie, you know I am
not mercenary'; and that no one wishes you to get on more
heartily than I do. I meant the letter to be very kind
indeed; and at least you will be pleased that I am de-
lighted with Killarney. Good-bye. The morning is lovely;
and we are just going out for a row.”
“Going out for a row ?” he repeated mechanically to
himself. Who were going out for a row? Miss Patience,
according to Kitty's own showing, scarcely stirred out of
the hotel at all. And what were they doing there? How
had he heard nothing about it? What did all this mean
-about the trouble of the world, and the sacrifice of one's
inclinations, and a future for him of which she was to be
the distant spectator ? He read the letter over again, in a
bewildered sort of way. It was not like Kitty—it was not
like the wilful, petulant, loving and teasing Kitty at all.
It is true that her letters had for some time past been
reserved-occasionally hurried and curt; but here was a
long rambling letter laying bare all her thoughts, and it
did not sound as if it was Kitty who was speaking. And
was she laying bare all her thoughts ? he asked himself.
Was it her great regard for his future fame that caused her
to refuse his appeal—an appeal that seemed to him to be
so simple and natural and opportune ?
Then he eagerly grasped at the notion that perhaps his
abrupt proposal had startled her. This was but maiden
coyness. She had been alarmed by the definite request that
she should come over and be married and occupy these
humble apartments until a more suitable dwelling could be
chosen. These rambling arguments of hers were a mere
girlish trick of fence. Modesty was sheltering itself be-
hind the guise of prudence. And he could have laughed
at Kitty's imploring him to believe that she was not mer-
cenary—as if it were likely he could suspect her of that !

Still there was something very strange and disquieting
in the tone of this letter; and when he sat down to answer,
he experienced the novel sensation of being afraid. Afraid
of Kitty! If he could have caught her by both hands, he
would not have been afraid. But that was the mischief of
it-the great distance between them. That was why he
was afraid — afraid of the misunderstandings that letters
cause. He wrote hurriedly; he seemed to have so much
to say; and wished to say it all at once; and, moreover, he
must needs write in good spirits if he would drive away her
despondency
“MY DARLING KITTY—I have received your extraor-
dinary letter. It does not sound as if you had written it at
all. Why are you so serious ? What has frightened you ?
Are you the same Kitty that, when I first came to London,
used to write every day nearly, 'Make haste; make haste;
for I love you so !'? And now there is not a word of love
in this long letter; but a great deal of downheartedness
and fear and political economy and Benjamin Franklin sort
of wisdom. And then, my pretty-eyed philosopher, your
facts are a little askew. You accuse me of being too
poetical ; and if to love you is to be romantic and poetical,
I will admit the charge. But if you mean that I allow
poetry or anything else to interfere with my care for the
future you are all wrong. You don't know how rigidly I've
saved up every possible penny since I came to London. I
don't go taking holidays at Killarney; when I have to go
for a journey, it's all because of a wicked young woman
who won't be reasonable and sensible and come and be
married at once. And really and seriously, Kitty, what
have you to fear? I have £110 saved ; and £ 200 a year
is quite enough to make a start with, in a quiet way; and
if things go better, won't you be rather glad in after life
that you and I were together during the poorer time?
You talk about my being precarious (your English, Miss
Kitty, has not been improved by the Killarney air), but is
not everything and everybody more or less so? You are
like Miss Patience, thinking that literature is so precarious
a profession because a tile might fall on your head from a
roof. No doubt this old lady might die; but so might

you, or I; and surely, since life is so uncertain, common
sense would counsel you to make the best of it while you
may. Life is not such a very long thing ; youth is still
shorter; and surely when two people love each other, and
have a little faith in the future, and a reasonable security
in the present, even Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard,
Catherine Romayne, and similar philosophers, might admit
that it would be unwise to throw away a certain happiness
on the chance of some good to come. It seems so strange
to have to talk to you like this, Kitty, even as a joke. I
can scarcely believe this letter of yours to be serious. Who
was it who declared that she could live on nothing; who
implored me never to leave her; who asked me to live in
her heart, and pay no rent'? And all that happened
little more than a year ago. What has changed her so in
so short a time?
“I know. They say that once in every seven years, on a
beautiful summer morning, just at sunrise, the O'Donoghue
of the Lakes comes down from his magic home in the
mountains, riding a white horse, and accompanied by fairies.
He rides across Lough Leane, and wherever he goes on
the dry land all his old possessions and splendour appear
again; and when he has seen that everything is right
he sets out home again. Now no doubt you have heard
that, if you have courage enough, you can go with him,
and cross Lough Leane dry-shod, and accompany him to
his home in the mountains, where, before bidding you
good-bye, he will present you with part of his buried trea-
sure. Have I found you out, Miss Kitty? Are you
watching for the O'Donoghue of the Lakes ? Is that why
your small head is stuffed with 'mercenariness'? Are you
so anxious to be rich, and drive through the country with
a carriage and pair, that you get up every morning at that
hotel before sunrise and wander away down to the lake-
side and look across and watch for the white horse and its
rider? Is that the peculiar charm you have found in
Killarney? And of course the want of sleep and the going
about so much alone, and the witchery of the whole thing,
have dazed you a little, and made you apprehensive, so that
I can scarcely believe it is you who are speaking to me.

“My dearest Kitty, you must really throw aside these
unreasonable fears—you who used to be so fearless, too!
If you are afraid to take such a decisive step as coming to
London by yourself, I will come over and fetch you. I
am entitled to a long holiday. Dearest Kitty, how would
it do for me to come over and meet you at Limerick, and
stay there long enough to be married, and go back over
the Killarney route ? I am confident I could take you to
beautiful places you are not likely to find on the ordinary
tourist route. Write—no, telegraph one word—'Yes'-
that can't take up much of your time, and I will come
over at once. And then, you see, as one must be practical
and business-like in order to please you, getting married in
that quiet way would be very inexpensive ; you would have
no white silk gown to buy, and I should have no lockets
to get for the bridesmaids. Now, Kitty, take heart of grace,
and telegraph at once. If you telegraph from Killarney, I
will go right on to Limerick and wait for you there. Don't
think about it; do it; if you sit down and begin to make
out all sorts of calculations, as if you were the secretary of
a life insurance company, of course you will arrive at no
decision at all, but only plunge yourself in gloom. What a
trip that will be, if you will only say 'Yes'! If you went
by Bandon and Dunmanway, we will come back by Inchi-
geelah; and of course we shall go down to Inisheen-and
perhaps to the stream there, some moonlight night, just to
let Don Fierna and the rest of them know that you had
not quite forgotten. You have not quite forgotten, Kitty?
I had the date engraved on the ring you gave me; and
then I grudged the expense; for it was useless. There
are some things that are engraven on the heart; they be-
come a part of you ; you can put them away from you only
when you put life away; and I do not think that either of
us is likely to forget the vow of that night.
“Well, now, Kitty, the inhuman wretch who occupies
the quaint small house by the river that I told you of still
remains in it; I often take a turn round that way to see if
there is not a board up; but no, the wretched limpet still
clings to his shell. Never mind; we shall have plenty of
time to walk about and pick out a comfortable little place

for ourselves ; for, you see, I can always use the fine morn-
ings for walking out, and shift on my work to the time of
rain. And then, when we give ourselves a whole holiday,
Kitty, there is no end to the beautiful, quiet places one can
get to from this neighbourhood. I have explored them
all; and the whole time I was thinking 'I know Kitty will
be charmed with this place; and I am certain she never
could have been here before. Scarcely anybody knows
what beautiful sequestered spots there are in Richmond
Park alone. Then, you see, Kitty, by taking those fur-
nished rooms to begin with, you will be able to fall into
housekeeping ways by degrees; and we shall take plenty of
time to choose a pretty small house, and put things into it
just as we want them. You will be surprised at the know-
ledge I have acquired of the prices of tables and chairs
and carpets; and Ross—that is your Scotch friend has
promised, when the great time comes, to present you with
a tea-service of old black Wedgwood that he picked up
somewhere in Surrey, and that is about the only thing of
value that he possesses. Just fancy your sitting in state at
your own tea-table in your own house! Will you have
another cup of tea, Mr. Ross?' 'No, thank you, my dear
Mrs. Fitzgerald, but if you would sing another of those Irish
songs, that is what I would like to have.' Then you go to
the piano; of course we must hire a piano the very first
thing, for you are not going to forget your music, Miss
Kitty, when you enter upon domestic slavery. And what
about “The Minstrel Boy' for our Scotchman? Or will
you make him cry with 'Silent, oh Moyle !' Or do you
think he will care as much for 'The Bells of Shandon as
we do? I think not. He does not know certain associa-
tions. He cannot recall the white Sunday mornings; and
the quietude of the country walks ; and Kitty declaring
that she should never have the courage to marry anybody,
and that her proper rôle in life was to be an old maid.
“ Come now, Kitty! You have a tremendous courage
when you like. Pull yourself together. If Miss Patience is
preaching political economy, tell her to go to the mischief.

and riding the high horse? I know you can be in any
mood you choose ; and the mood I would have you choose,
is that of the Kitty of the old, beautiful, love-sweetened
days, not this timid, fearing, business-like Kitty, whom I
don't know a bit. Who wrote 'Just tell them there's a
poor girl in Ireland, who is breaking her heart for your
sake'? I know whatever troubles you may be thinking of
now, everything will look quite bright and hopeful when I
get hold of your shoulders and challenge your eyes to do
anything but smile. So no more of your despondency,
you pretty black-eyed tiny sweetheart; but one word, and
the expenditure of one shilling; and then don't bother your
head any more about it until you see me at Limerick.
Then I will take command of you, and be responsible for
you, and we will together make short work of your
economical fears

well to believe in your want of courage ; and who sends no
other message, or kisses, or anything of the kind—for he is

He went out, and walked rapidly to the pillar letter-box,
and posted the letter; there seemed so little time to lose.
And then he walked back more slowly, wondering if he
had said everything likely to entice Kitty to a decision.
Just as he was entering the courtyard the postman
came along with the second morning delivery; and he had
two letters for Fitzgerald. Master Willie took them with little
interest (for he was still thinking of the phrases he had
used in the appeal sent over the sea) and opened them
leisurely as he was going up the stair. And yet the first of
these read oddly enough.
“ DEAR MR. FITZGERALD—I wonder if you could spare
me a few minutes to-morrow, Wednesday, evening, before
you leave the house. Or, if that is inconvenient, any other
evening will do; but to-morrow evening I am sure to be at

He could not imagine what Miss Chetwynd could have
to say to him ; but as nothing further was to be made out of
the letter, he put it in his pocket. The next that he opened
was written on the note-paper of a hotel in Venice.
"DEAR FITZ—It is an age since I heard anything of
you; and I have seen so few English periodicals that I
have no means of telling how you are getting on. Well,
I hope; you have enthusiasm ; good health ; and an in-
satiable thirst for work ; Pactolus will flow your way sooner
or later. The beast of a stream doesn't flow my way ; quite
the reverse ; it flies at my approach; hence these tears.
The fact is I am temporarily very hard up, and awkwardly
situated, as well—I can't explain, but you may guess; and
so, to get out of these embarrassments, I have taken a
liberty which I know you won't mind, for it can't cause
you any inconvenience. I have drawn a bill on you at

He went down the steps again and knocked at Ross's
door.
" Come in !"
He entered and found the Scotchman smoking an after-

breakfast pipe, seated opposite a picture and staring at it;
but with neither brushes nor palette in his hand.
“There !" said Fitzgerald, triumphantly handing him the
letter. “Didn't I tell you so ?”
Ross read the letter through deliberately, and handed it
back.
“Well ?” said he, “I always thought him a scoundrel.
Now I think him an impudent scoundrel. What more ?"
“I tell you he is nothing of the kind !" said Fitzgerald,
indignantly. “Don't you see from that letter that he does
not think he has done me any injury? I told you so. I
told you there were people who otherwise might be admir-
able enough, but who simply wanted that sixth sense about
money matters- "
“That sixth sense!” said Ross, angrily. “And did not
I tell you not to go and confuse things by calling common
honesty a sixth sense ? If a scoundrel in the street picks
my pocket, I do not think about any sixth sense ; I give
him into the hands of the nearest policeman."
“But you Scotchmen are too literal, and so exacting.
You won't believe in a man having any virtues, unless he
has them all. Now this man was exceedingly good-natured ;
he was very friendly to me; I am certain he does not think
at this minute that he did me any wrong; he simply has
no conscientiousness on that one point- "
“It's a want of conscientiousness that has landed many
a poor wretch in jail, who had far greater excuses than that
idling selfish creature,” said John Ross. “Man, I thought
he had opened your een. I thought it was the one good
turn he had done ye. I thought he had given ye a lesson.
And now, I suppose, ye'll go and sign this bill; and you'll
believe he'll pay it; and the end will be—ten pounds to
one is the bet I will put on it-I'm saying I will bet ten
pounds to five shillings—that not one farthing of that
money will come out of anybody's pocket but your own, if
ye put your name on the back of the paper.”
He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and continued,
still more angrily-
“Man, ye do not deserve to have a young lass waiting
for ye-away over there in Ireland, waiting for ye—and

you to talk about throwing away your money on a scoundrel
like that-
“But wait a minute, Ross: I'm not going to do anything
of the kind. I would not accept a bill, or back it—the fact
is, I don't know what the proper phrase is—for any human
being. I've seen the results of it over in our district; the
Coursing Club showed me that. And indeed,” added
Fitzgerald, going forward to look at the picture, “I may
soon have need of all the money I can get. There is just
a-a-possibility of my setting up house, in a small way,
by-and-by.”
“Ay? Well, that's better news. That's sensible. But
don't turn the mill too hard. You were at work early this
morning."
“At work?” said Fitzgerald, staring, “I have not been
at work at all. I haven't had any breakfast yet, by the
way.”
“Then what was all that stamping up and down for ?
I thought ye were hammering out an epic poem.”
“Oh," said Fitzgerald, vaguely remembering that he
might have paced up and down the room in his eagerness
to get persuasive phrases. “I was only writing a letter.”
“It must have been a terrible business," said the other,
grimly.
"So it is," said Fitzgerald, perhaps a trifle absently, “to
convince one who is at a great distance from you, in a letter.
It is difficult-and disheartening at times.”
Ross glanced at him keenly.
" Things are not going quite right, then ?" said he.
“Oh yes," answered Fitzgerald, with a forced cheerful-
ness. “Oh yes. Quite right. Oh yes, I think everything
is going quite right; and by-and-by I hope you will soon
have the opportunity for presenting the Wedgwood tea-
cups with a pretty speech. Of course, letter-writing is a
roundabout kind of way of arranging anything ; it is
difficult to explain and to persuade; and one is so apt
to take wrong impressions from a letter. Especially a girl,
you see, who is nervous and anxious, and afraid to trust
her own judgment in taking a decided step. Any one
can understand that. Then-then-then it is very hard

and difficult to write, you see; for if you are too serious;
she may think you are alarmed, and she may prefer the
safety of remaining as she is; and again, if you are too
cheerful in trying to raise her spirits, she may think that
the immediate necessity for coming to a decision cannot
possibly be near. It is so much better to see the—the
person. But this time, Ross—I don't mind telling you—I
have made a very definite proposal. I should not wonder
if I were to leave London this very week—and come back
with a wife.”
“Good luck to ye, then. Now I can understand there's
no fear o'your letting that fellow have any more o' your
money."
“Of course," said Fitzgerald, handing him the other
letter, “that may have something to do with it.”
Ross glanced over Miss Chetwynd's brief note.
“Whatever the matter is, it is important," said Fitz-
gerald. “She has never asked me to see her like that
before. Perhaps they are tired of the present arrangement.
Perhaps they think it costs too much; or they may want to
have some one else. Well, well,” said he, more cheerfully,
“ if it is so, let it be so. One can live somehow. I am not
going to break my heart about that.”
“Are ye coming out for a stroll then?"
“Indeed no. I am going to get some breakfast ; and
then set to work on another article on the Irish Ballads.
It's wonderful with what heart you work when you know
the work is going to be paid for.”
“It's no a common experience wi' me,” said Ross, drily.
Fitzgerald was whistling to himself as he went up the
steps again. It was not the possibility of his losing that
chief means of livelihood that could daunt him. Now his
mind was full of far other concerns; and he was forcing
himself to believe the best. When was the white day to
come? At Limerick, at Inchigeelah, on the Blackwater,
on the Shannon, he and she together would think but
little of what had happened or might happen in London.
Might they not find a four-leaved shamrock somewhere in
the still summer woods ?
He worked away at this essay on the Irish Ballads with

great apparent cheerfulness. When he stamped up and
down, as was his wont, sometimes he hummed the air of
one or other of the old songs he was transcribing. But
when he came to “Kathleen O'More ”—“My own little
Kathleen, my poor little Kathleen, my Kathleen O'More"
-he did not get on so quickly. Perhaps there was some
chance association-or the bit of likeness between the
names; but it seemed difficult to him to copy these lines.
And at last the pen was pushed aside, and his head fell
forward on his clasped hands.
Why was Kitty at Killarney ; and why was she so cold,
and speaking in a voice that seemed far away and strange,
and not close, and tender, and familiar, as in the old and
happy time? She could not have forgotten Inisheen!

IMAGININGS.
It was without concern or apprehension of any kind that
he went up on this evening to Hyde Park Gardens. He
cared not what might happen in that direction. He was
scarcely thinking of it.
As usual on reaching the house he left his hat and coat
in the hall, and carried his bundle of books and newspapers
upstairs to the drawing-room; but, to his surprise, found
no one there. So he deposited the literature on the table,
and went and stood before the fire-an institution retained
in this house, for the mere sake of cheerfulness, long after
the early summer warmth had set in ; and stared into the
shifting and flickering lights as if he could find something
behind them. There was an absolute silence in the room.
Then a slight noise startled him from his reverie, and,
turning, he found Mary Chetwynd approaching him, with a
pleasant smile on her face.
“Good evening, Mr. Fitzgerald,” said the tall young
lady with the pretty head and the clear eyes.
“Good evening,” said he, very respectfully.
“Auntie's compliments, and she is very sorry she can't
see you this evening. She has caught a bad cold, and the
doctor has ordered her to keep to her room for a couple of
days. Won't you sit down ?"
As Miss Chetwynd gave him this invitation, she herself
passed over to an easy-chair near the fire. What perfect
self-possession she had ! Everything she did or said
seemed to come to her so simply and naturally. When

he observed this quiet and serious dignity and grace of
manner, he could not but think of Kitty's will-o'-the-wisp
flashes of petulance, and affection, and coyness; but it was
with no conscious desire to draw any comparison. Kitty
was to him the one woman in the world ; there was “none
like her, none."
“I hope it is nothing serious ?” said he.
“Oh dear no. Not in the least. In fact, I am wicked
enough to look on it as opportune, for now I can speak to
you freely for a few minutes, if you will give me so much
of your time; and I must tell you that I have a great favour
to ask of you, and that I am rather frightened that I may
not put my petition before you properly."
She did not look frightened. She spoke pleasantly; and
there was a sort of smile in her eyes.
“Perhaps I may be able to spare you some embarrass-
ment, Miss Chetwynd,” said he, “if I guess what you want
to say- "
“I don't think you could do that, exactly," was the
answer.
“Only this,” he said, with indifference, " if you have any
friend you wish to put into my position here, I hope you
won't think twice about saying som
“Oh, but that is not it at all,” she said, promptly. “Who
could fill your position? Who could give dear old auntie
that interest in everyday life that seemed to be going away
from her altogether? Indeed, Mr. Fitzgerald, I am very
grateful to you—we all are. You have made my aunt
quite chatty and talkative again; and what she talks most
about is yourself, and your writings, and your friend the
Scotch artist. Oh, that would never do."
At another time Fitzgerald would have been glad
enough to hear this frank and kindly speech; for he had
not guessed that this was the light in which she regarded
the situation. But on this evening, somehow, his thoughts
were elsewhere; he was indifferent as to what might happen
to him with regard to this post of his ; there was a weight
on his heart—he knew not why.
“You have often heard auntie speak of Boat of Garry?"
“ Yes," said Fitzgerald, with a sudden awakening of

264
SHANDON BELLS
interest. For now she was three hundred miles and more
nearer his thoughts.
“That is what I want to speak to you about, then; and
I shall have to make some explanations before I put my
request before you. No doubt you know that auntie, who
is generosity itself, made a present of the whole place
just as it stood-horses and carriages and so forth, every-
thing, indeed—to my poor brother.”
“Oh yes, I know that,” said Fitzgerald, who had heard
a good deal about this place on Bantry Bay from one source
or another, and had even imbibed the preposterous notion
that Miss Chetwynd had wanted to turn him into a bailiff or
steward or something of the kind.
“Fortunately my poor brother was pretty well off," she
continued, “and so he could keep up the place ; though
hunting was his favourite amusement, and he always spent
the winter in England. But the summer and autumn he
usually spent at Boat of Garry; and sometimes auntie and
I went over and stayed for a while. Those were very happy
days for the dear old lady; for she quite worshipped her
boy, as she called him, and she was so proud to see him
go about over his own place. Her kindness to him was
beyond anything you can imagine. I don't know whether
she has ever told you, but she is dreadfully afraid of the
sea "
"I guessed as much from one or two things she has
said,” Fitzgerald answered.
“I think she was nearly drowned when a girl, or some-
thing like that. However, she detests being on the water.
And yet she went and bought a small steam-launch for
Frank-for the place is rather out of the way; and she used
to control her nerves and go on board that detestable boat
-yes, and drag me too—and pretend to be quite delighted
when we went roaring and puffing through the beautiful
quiet scenery up by Glengariff, or darted about Bearhaven,
threatening collisions on every hand. What I thought of
these excursions I need not tell you "
“I don't know much about steam-launches; but I should
think ladies would not care much for them.”
That was what he said ; what he was thinking of was

Glengariff. Had Kitty and Miss Patience passed that way?
Were the roses out in the hedgerows yet ? Had they
walked along the shore in the twilight? Had she tried the
piano in the drawing-room later on? Did the people know
who she was ? Had she sung for them? Why had she
not written?
"Then after the-the dreadful accident," said Miss Chet-
wynd, and for a moment she looked aside somewhat, -
“you have heard about that too, I suppose—when poor
Frank was taken from us—I thought auntie would never
recover. Her interest in life seemed to be completely
gone. But what she insisted on was that Boat of Garry
should be left exactly as my poor brother had left it. -
Nothing was to be touched. You see, the property reverted
to her; and she could not bear the idea of going there;
and still less the idea of selling it; and so she said it
should remain exactly as Frank left it. And so it has
remained, from that day to this."
She heaved a little sigh.
“ That is the sad part of the story. Perhaps you knew
most of it. And now I come to the request I have to make
of you, Mr. Fitzgerald, and it is a very plain and unsenti-
mental one. I really think it a pity that a property like that
should be allowed to remain absolutely useless; and I am not
sure that auntie would not think so also, if some change could
be made gradually. I don't actually wish that she should
sell the place, for it has been a long time in the possession
of her side of the family ; besides, it has associations for
both of us. It is a long time now since my poor brother
was killed; and-and, if I may hint as much again—since
my aunt made your acquaintance she has been much more
like her former self, and less given to that moping she gave
way to for a time. Now don't you yourself think it a pity
that a place like that over at Bantry should be allowed to
exist without being of use to a single soul ?".
“It does seem so," said Fitzgerald. “But does no one
occupy it?"
“No; that is the absurdity of it— well, why should I
call it an absurdity when it was only a testimony to the
poor old lady's grief ? No one occupies it. We have to

pay—at least, my aunt pays—for keeping up the whole
establishment; and all that we get from it is a hamper of
game now and again in the autumn, or a salmon. There
the whole place is—horses, a coachman, a gamekeeper, a
yachtsman, and two women-servants; and I suppose the
only person who makes any use of the place is Mr. M'Gee,
the solicitor in Bantry, for when he goes round to pay the
wages, and that, I suppose he has some shooting, or a sail
in a steam-launch. I proposed some time ago to my
aunt that she should at least bring the horses and carriages
to London ; but when poor old auntie said nothing at all,
but only turned away to hide the tears in her eyes, what
further could I urge? You see, they were his horses. He
was proud of them. So with the steam-launch. She would
not hear of its being sold. In fact, for a long time, any
reference to the place was so distressing to her, that I did
not even mention it-except when I had to draw out a
cheque for Mr. M'Gee, and then it was simply, 'Auntie,
dear, Mr. M'Gee wants so much.' You may think all this an
absurd piece of sentiment-perhaps it is; but then, you see,
I am Frank's sister; and I know how kind my aunt was to
him; and if she has still this feeling about preserving intact
what belonged to him, I don't find it altogether ridiculous.”
“I hope not,” said Fitzgerald, gently. He thought she
spoke very prettily about this matter. He should not have
thought she had so much sympathy.
“But now," she said, “now that time has gone by, and
auntie seems a little more cheerful, I think some effort
should be made to get some good out of the place. I don't
know that I am very penurious; but I assure you I do
grudge to have to draw out cheques to keep up a perfectly
useless place like that. Perhaps it is because I see a good
deal of want and trouble and misery that my conscience
rebels against throwing away 'money like that.”
“Surely you are quite right,” said Fitzgerald—though he
did not quite know why he should be appealed to. “If
Mrs. Chetwynd does not wish to sell the place; and if it
would be painful for her to go and live in it, why might she
not let it? If the shooting is fair, it ought to let. The
neighbourhood is pretty enough.”

“ That is what I think too,” said Mary Chetwynd, with
that placid intelligent smile of hers. “But the only person
who could induce her to let the place, and so save all this
expense, is yourself, Mr. Fitzgerald ; and now you know
why I have ventured to ask you to do me a great
favour."
“I? What could I do about it?" he exclaimed.
“If I were to go now and ask auntie to let Boat of
Garry," said Miss Chetwynd, “she would think me very
cruel and hard-hearted. The idea of turning in a stranger
to succeed to poor Frank's dog-cart, and his gun-room,
and the little cabin in the steam-yacht—that would be
quite terrible to her. But she might get accustomed to
the idea. She would not mind your going over and
occupying the place. She has a great regard for you.
You are about Frank's age; you know about shooting; it
would seem natural enough to her that you should go over
and live at Boat of Garry for a time. That once done,
the rest would be easy. There would be no difficulty
about persuading her to let it next year to one or other of
our friends—some of the scientifics, as she calls them, are
very fond of shooting. I know I am asking a great deal,"
she continued quickly, for she saw that he looked rather
astonished. “You are making your way in literature, and
this looks as if you might be taken away from that for a
considerable time. But would it be so? I cannot imagine
any place better fitted for literary work, unless, indeed, you
found it really too solitary ; and then you could send across
to Bantry, and you may be sure that Mr. M'Gee, who is a
sporting character, would be only too glad to join you.
Then, again—you see, Mr. Fitzgerald,” she said, with a
laugh, “I have to begin by persuading you, and if I fail
with you, I am done altogether—you would have the kind
of holiday that would just suit you, according to all
accounts. You would have fishing, shooting, and boating
-in a sort of country that you are familiar with. You
have been very close at work, I should judge, since you
came to London. You have scarcely ever been out of
London."
“But,” said he, in rather a bewildered way, "do you

SHANDON BELLS
mean this? Is it an actual proposal—that I should go to
Ireland now?"
“Oh no; not at all,” she said pleasantly. “It is only
a project of mine. My prayer to you is that if auntie
should suggest your going over to Ireland, and taking your
holiday in that way, you won't refuse. I have put the
whole situation of affairs before you ; and if you cared to
take your holiday that way, it would be, as you see, con-
ferring a great obligation on us—and on me especially, for
you would be helping me to carry out my plan.”
It was a prospect that ought to have been alluring
enough to a young man of his habits and occupations.
But he could not think of that now. There was something
of far greater import to him and his future occupying his
thoughts.
“You mean this year?” he says. “Now?"
“I am not sure about ‘now,'” she said. “Well, say
now,' or as soon as I can get my aunt coaxed to make
the suggestion. The salmon-fishing has begun, has it
not?”
“I am sorry," said he, rather breathlessly, “but—but I
may be called away to Ireland on important affairs within
the very next few days—I could not pledge myself with
any certainty- "
And then a wild idea occurred to him—an idea that
sent the blood rushing to his brain. What if the two
excursions could be combined ? What if he were to take
Kitty to Boat of Garry instead of to Inisheen? Here,
indeed, was a project! Poor Kitty, whose imagination
had been bothered by vain dreams of driving a carriage
and pair !-here was the very carriage and pair provided
for her, and the quietest of country residences for the
honeymoon, and a yacht at her disposal, and servants
and all awaiting her! Could anything be more opportune ?
Was there ever such a coincidence in human history?
Of course he knew that great people frequently lent their
country seat to a bridegroom and bride as a safe and
pleasant retreat during the honeymoon; but that he and
Kitty should be suddenly and unexpectedly provided with
this paradise down by the sea—that, surely, was a thing that

269
never could have entered her brain, even when she was
dreaming of the bliss of having a carriage and pair, and
being rich, and driving through pretty scenery. Moreover,
would it not be a great inducement for her to fix a definite
time? Could she withstand the pictures he would draw
of this happy and secret retirement there?
“But,” said he, quickly, “did you mean that it was
necessary that I should go to Boat of Garry alone ?”
“Alone ? Not at all,” said she. “I spoke of your
being there alone in case you might want to continue your
literary work. Of course, I don't think I could induce
auntie to let you take with you, although you are a great
favourite of hers, a big party of strangers- "
“Oh, I don't mean that at all,” said Fitzgerald, hastily;
his brain was painting pictures with such vivid colours as
John Ross never squeezed out of any tin tube.
“It would be a great favour to me," continued Miss
Chetwynd, seeing that he was now considering her scheme,
“and it would be a pleasant holiday for you, and it would
be doing a service to poor old auntie. She would see that
very soon. The present state of affairs could not possibly
continue; and I am sure, once the gradual change was
made, she would be the first to acknowledge that it was
right. To tell you the truth, Mr. Fitzgerald, I was once
a little afraid of that fixed idea of hers. I did not like it,
especially when she was alone, her melancholy seemed to
get so morbid and hopeless. But now that she has come
back to the old interest in everyday affairs, surely now is
the time to get her to give up this too sensitive repugnance
of hers to having Boat of Garry touched in any way; and
I don't see any one else who can do it so easily as you.
I do not know whether it has occurred to you," she
continued—and for the first time she showed a little
embarrassment—"but I think my aunt wishes to put you,
as far as is now possible, in Frank's place—I mean in her
little world of friendships and interests; and sometimes I
am quite startled, when I come into the room accidentally,
to hear her chatting to you in exactly the same tone she
used to use to him. She thinks you are exactly his height;
but you are an inch and a half taller-two inches, perhaps.

And dear old auntie forgets a little ; and now she thinks
that poor Frank was just as fond of books and writing and
poetry and all that as you are, whereas there was nothing
Frank hated so much as a book, except “British Rural
Sports," and Colonel Hawker's volume, and the Field, on
Sunday morning. You won't find much of a library at
Boat of Garry, if you go there. Do you think it is hard of
me to speak of my dead brother like that? Sometimes I
think I have less than my share of natural affection, when
I find I can't quite believe all that poor old auntie believes
about him. And yet I was very fond of him. The world
seemed quite changed for me when he died; there seemed
to be no one with whom I ever could be so intimate ; and
who did me so much good in talking plain common sense
when I was inclined to attempt impossible things. And
yet when I find how common such sorrows are, I some-
times think that I grieve too much; and that I should try
not to think about him at all; but to go on with my work,
such as it is, and let everything be for the best. Only the
world seemed to get so empty when he was taken away
from us. I cared more for his approval than for anybody's,
although he was not clever. I could not bear his laughing
at me. I used to go out with him when he went shooting,
though the cry of a hare when it was struck cut my heart
like a knife. The smallest present he made me was of
more value than anything anybody else could give me.
He used to call me his 'little girl,' though I was very nearly
as tall as he was. And—and although I am not very senti-
mental—still, to tell you the truth, Mr. Fitzgerald, I should
not like the idea—not just yet—of your taking a big party
of strangers to-to-Frank's house."
"Oh, of course not,” said he, instantly. “I did not
dream of such a thing."
She was a little tremulous about the lips--only for a
second.
"If any one went with me,” said he, thinking it better
she should know the truth, “it would be my wife.”
“But you are not married, Mr. Fitzgerald ?" she
exclaimed, with wonder in her eyes.
"NO "

*But you are going to be ?” she said, with a quick
interest.
Then her eyes dropped.
“I beg your pardon. I really beg your pardon," she
said, as she rose. “I have taken up so much of your
time. You ought to have stopped my chatter. Well,
may I assume that you are my accomplice ?”
“Miss Chetwynd,” said he, with a smile, “I have a
suspicion that your ways are very like your aunt's ways,
and that you contrive kindnesses under the guise of begging
for a favour.”
“On the contrary,” she said, as she gave him her hand,
“my motives are distinctly mercenary. I don't want that
money to be thrown away from year to year for nothing ;
and I ask for your help. At the same time I am not
saying that you might not have a pleasant holiday there.
Good-night, and thank you so much."
Even in his eager haste to get outside and consider all
the bearings of this new proposal that he would lay before
Kitty, he could not but carry away with him a pleasant
impression from this little interview. Mary Chetwynd had
been so gentle, so kind, and serious, and true in manner,
so good an example (as he thought) of an accomplished,
and amiable, and frank young English gentlewoman, that
he had a little remorse about it all. Perhaps he had
misunderstood her somewhat It did not appear that her
heart had been altogether hardened by scornful knowledge :
what if there were no such deadly antagonism, after all, be-
tween sentiment and science? How nicely she had spoken
of old Mrs. Chetwynd : what true affection breathed in her
little simple sentences about her brother ! Even that bit
of embarrassment seemed so womanly; she had instantly
withdrawn her questions for fear of giving offence. And if
she were to prove the means of putting this great happi-
ness within the reach of Kitty and himself, would he
not seek some opportunity in the future to show that he
was not altogether insensible of her kindness ?
But the immediate thing was to let Kitty know. He
was so anxious to put any additional inducement before
her; and certainly this one--as his quick imagination

pictured it—was of sufficient value. But would it appeal
in like measure to Kitty? Would she be able to see all
those fascinating glimpses of their life together in the house
by the sea that now crowded in on his mind? What a
pity it was he had not been able to add this temptation to
his letter of that morning! No matter; by the time she
reached Limerick both letters would probably be awaiting
her at the post office.
Then in his impatience he walked to a telegraph office,
and sent off this message to her : “If you are remaining
at Killarney, ask letters to be forwarded from Limerick.
Do not answer first letter till you get second. Telegraph
if this reached.”
This second letter was the one that he was now
hurrying home to write. And these were bright-coloured
pictures that he saw before him in the gray dusk of the
evening—as he went rapidly along the London streets.
He somewhat forced himself to think of them. There was
something else he would not think of—that he put away.
This was the immediate question : whether Kitty also
would not be fascinated by these new possibilities ? Had
she already had a passing glance at the beauties of Glen-
gariff?—then she would know the sort of country through
which she could have her daily drives in that coveted
carriage and pair. Would she come part of the way up
the hill in the evening to meet him on his return from the
shooting? Would she take a book with her and sit on
the river bank, among the warm grass and the meadow-
sweet, while with a big sweep of the rod he dropped the
great salmon fly into the deep and distant pool? And
then he knew that Kitty would jump up with a shriek of
delight when the struggle began; and she would watch
with wide eyes the rushes and the sharp and dangerous
leaps of the big fish; and by-and-by, when victory was
becoming sure, would she stand by his side with the gaff
ready to his hand ? For one thing, Kitty was not the best
of sailors. But then you could so quickly run back again
in a steam-launch if there was anything like a sea on
outside ; and no doubt still days would occur on which
she might--all by herself, as it were-imagine Kitty in sole

command of a steamer-sail all the way around by Dursey
Head into Kenmare River, while he shot across the Slieve
Miskish heights, if the Boat of Garry shootings extended so
far. And then to think of his being away up there in the
wilderness of rock and heather; and far below him the
little toy steamer; and the tiniest figure sitting in the stern,
reading. Can the dog-whistle reach as far? Or the view
halloo of the keeper to the engine-man? Or is it Kitty
herself who first catches sight of them; and starts up, and
waves a handkerchief? It is almost a race down the hill
at last; and then the little boat is sent ashore ; and they
are pulled out to the small steamer ; and the birds and the
big brown hares are all laid out on deck. And then away
to sea again in the golden evening ; with the long head-
lands growing warmer in colour as the sun sinks; and the
Atlantic murmuring all along the solitary coasts. Would
there be a piano at Boat of Garry? Or would their
evenings be spent out of doors, mostly, until the stars
began to be visible over the trees? Kitty was fond of the
darkness and of silence; they would hear the curlews
calling along the shore as they went home through the
meadows.
It was of Kitty at Boat of Garry, not of Kitty at
Killarney, that he forced himself to think. Also he
persuaded himself that this way of spending the honey-
moon would be a very inexpensive one. Kitty must
admit that. There would be no hotel bills; no costs by
road or rail. Kitty was almost in the neighbourhood; the
travelling would be nothing. Would it be asking too much
that the carriage should meet them at Kenmare, to take
them up and over the gaunt mountain road until they
descended into the leafy woods of Glengariff ? No doubt
the horses would be the better for some good stiff work
now; it was far from probable that the coachman had
taken them out for regular exercise, in a place where there
was no master.
These points and many more were put before Kitty in
this second letter. It was a very matter-of-fact letter. It
assumed that Kitty would be as delighted as himself with
this opportune proposal. Why should he implore and
T

beseech ? — would not his faithful Kitty rejoice as he
rejoiced, to see their dearest hopes within easy reach of
fulfilment? And it behoved him to be very business-like
now. : Kitty need not be afraid of the cost of the wedding;
the simpler the better. And if he disingenuously omitted
to mention all the minute points of the case—if, without
being guilty of any misstatement whatsoever, he still left it
possible for Kitty to imagine that this proposal that they
should occupy Boat of Garry had been made by the
Chetwynds with especial reference to her marriage-trip-
what harm was there in Kitty innocently believing that
these two ladies wished to be kind to her?
So he went and posted that letter too. All that he
could do he had done. Then he walked back to the
courtyard; found John Ross at home; and the rest of the
evening was spent in the Scotchman's studio.
For Fitzgerald had grown half-afraid of sitting by himself
in the solitary room upstairs, Sometimes strange imaginings
would flash across his brain— fears that took his breath
away—that were hateful and horrible—that were as un-
worthy of himself as they were cruel to the true-hearted
and tender-eyed Kitty, who was so far away, with no one
to speak for her innocence and honour and faith, if he
should dare to doubt

telegram, came to these poor lodgings in the Fulham Road.
No work was possible for him. He kept pacing up and
down the room, listening for the postman; or idly wander-
ing through the streets of Chelsea, always certain that her
reply would be awaiting him there on his return. If he
thought of anything, it was of how he and she together
would occupy the mornings, and days, and long summer
evenings, at Boat of Garry. His eyes were turned to the
south. He seemed to keep his face averted from Killarney.
Limerick was a blank to him.
He tried to avoid John Ross; but Ross was not to be
avoided. He came upstairs; regarded Fitzgerald for a
second; looked suspiciously round—as was his wont, in-
deed, for his eyes seemed to take in everything; and forth-
with drove his neighbour down into the studio, where
Fitzgerald found that a sumptuous supper (according to
their notions down that way) had been prepared for two.
“I have watched ye, my man,” said Ross, “once or
twice of late. Ye are at it again.”
“At what ?"
“Starving yourself.”
“Indeed I am not. Why should I starve myself when
I have four pounds a week, with chances of more ?"
Ross muttered something to himself, as he brought one
or two further articles to the supper-table. Then he fetched
a bottle of beer for his companion; and they both sat down.

Fitzgerald began to talk about a railway accident that had
happened the previous day; but Ross had other thoughts
in his mind.
“Ye are not starving yourself, then?” said he, glancing
· at his neighbour.
"Not in the least.”
“Ye are not looking well, then. Ye keep too much
indoors; and too much in town. Ye'll forget what the
country is like if ye go on like this; and fine leeterature
you'll turn out then !-leeterature with a white face and
bloodless hands. What the mischief do ye mean?” he
exclaimed suddenly. “No meat?"
Fitzgerald had pushed his plate away, and was merely
playing with a bit of crust.
“I had something," he said evasively.
“When?"
“Oh, not very long ago.".
“When?" said the other.
“Well, about the middle of the day."
“ And so ye have got yourself into the habit of eating
nothing after two o'clock ?”.
He himself was busy enough. For a time Fitzgerald
had all the talking. What he talked about was merely the
current news of the papers.
“There's an article I would like to see ye write; ye
might do some good wi't,” said Ross at length.
“What do you charge for supplying subjects to poor
authors ?”
“Oh, but it's no for fine leeterary treatment, this. It's
a sledge-hammer ye want, to smash down a piece of meeser-
able hypocrisy. I want ye to denounce the perneecious
sympathy that ye find expressed in books—and mostly in

when the unpaid tradesmen come ringing at the door. And
then the way they are described as peetying themselves, and
sighing with resignation over their struggles, just as if God
had decreed them to have hired broughams, and dinner-
parties, and their daughters at boarding-schools, and what
not; and as if their no being able to settle their bills was
something they could not make out! No; it is their right
to live in such a way; it never occurs to them that if they
have five hundred pounds a year, they'd better live on that,
or less; they have to keep up appearances, and you and
me are expected to have a great peety for all they suffer
through their perneecious vanity and pretence. If they
choose to live beyond their income, let them smart for it !
—why should I peety them? I peety the butchers and
greengrocers that they plunder; or, worse still, that they
leave so long unpaid that the poor man, for want of ready
money, is forced to take to over-charging and trade dodges,
and in a measure becomes a thief. Now I am told," said
he, fixing his keen eyes on Fitzgerald for a second, that
you Irish are rayther given to that keeping up of appear-
ances—that is to say, living at a rate ye cannot properly
afford.”
Fitzgerald suspected as much. These homilies of Ross's
generally ended with a personal application.
“Some of the small squireens are pretty much given
that way,” he said, “but I suppose you'll find about an
equal amount of pretentiousness everywhere among the poor
genteel. It isn't easy for them to give up the way of living
they have been used to."
“But it's the beginning, my lad !" said the other. "It's
the beginning to live beyond your means that's the mischief.
Now, you, for example; how are you going to begin ?".
"I told you. In two small rooms, I hope, at perhaps
eight or ten shillings a week. Then we shall look about
for a house."
“What size ?"
“Small. But I know what you are thinking of, Ross;
and there's no use beating about the bush. You are think-
ing that I am starving myself, being too keen in saving up
money; and that this probably means that I shall start

:
housekeeping in too expensive a way. I think that is
about what you are afraid of.”
“It is,” said the other, promptly. “You have just hit
it. I cannot understand the use of such violent means.
I take it that when two young people get married they
should accommodate themselves reasonably and fairly to
their income— not starving yourself, laddie !—and when
circumstances improve, let their expenditure grow. But if
ye begin at the beginning with a vain pretence of genteelity,
and get into trouble, do ye expect I am going to peety ye?
Not one jot.”
“No, what you would do would be to lend us money,"
said Fitzgerald, who knew the ways of this person. “But
there's no starvation in the case—not the least.”
“Then what is the matter with ye? Where got ye that
grayness in the face ?" said his friend, whose eyes missed
nothing.
“I have been working hard,” said the other, evasively,
“and been anxious a little about one or two things."
“I wish ye could bring that young lass over here and
marry her straight off," said Ross, bluntly.
“That may not be so far away," was Fitzgerald's answer;
and his friend though he waited for a second, regarding
him, as if he expected him to say more—accepted Fitz-
gerald's silence, and forebore to press him with any question.
Next morning there was again neither letter nor telegram.
This suspense was more than he could bear. He hastily
went to the telegraph office, and sent messages both to
Killarney and Limerick, asking whether she had not re-
ceived his communications; more than that, he telegraphed
to the post-master at Limerick, asking to be informed
whether letters addressed to Miss Romayne had been sent
or called for.
The day passed somehow; there was no answer. And
now he made sure she could be neither at Killarney nor
at Limerick; and a thousand conjectures filled his anxious
mind as to what might have happened. He went back
over her letters. There she had used the phrase “make
our way” to Limerick; and it occurred to him that, instead
of coming back by rail to Mallow and so getting north, it

was just possible she and Miss Patience might have tried
to get round by Tralee and Listowel, taking the stage-
coaches. And although they were both pretty experienced
travellers, who could tell what slight misadventure might
not have detained them somewhere in these western wilds ?
It was the only possible explanation of Kitty's silence.
And again he convinced himself that there could not have
been any serious accident; or that would have found its
way to the papers. That truant Kitty, to go and lose her-
self among these Kerry mountains !
Then, when he was least expecting it, there came to him
a letter-or brief note, rather.
“Killarney, Thursday morning.
“DEAR WILLIE—You drive me to say that you are very
inconsiderate in worrying me with these constant letters
and telegrams. I meet with so much consideration and
kindness on every hand that it is all the more surprising to
find you so exacting and impatient. That would not seem
a pleasing prospect to any one. I have not sent for your
letters to the Limerick post office; because there would
not be time; we leave here to-morrow; and do not go to
Limerick, the engagement being cancelled. But I dare-
say I know what is in them; and I am rather tired of
arguing. Besides, you do not seem to think of anything
but your own wishes. How could I turn adrift Miss
Patience, who has no means of livelihood whatever ? She
has been most faithful and good and kind to me; and, of
course, I could not send her away without making some
provision for her. I am sure I wish to please every one-
especially those who have been very kind to me; but it is
sometimes so distracting to try to please everybody that
sometimes I don't know what I may not do. But please
be a little forbearing with me; you are so impetuous.
“Your affectionate KITTY.”
He stared at the letter in dumb amazement. Was it
really Kitty who had written that? Was it the Kitty with
whom he had walked arm-in-arm through the hawthorn lanes
on the Sunday mornings—who could find no speech soft

enough, no caressings endearing enough, no words of love
true, and close, and near enough, for him—who was now
reproaching him with his want of consideration and taunt-
ing him with the suggestion that others were kinder than
he? Was it possible for a woman's heart to change so ?
He would not look at the intermediate time; he would not
think of the gathering coldness of the last six or eight
months' letters ; it was the Kitty of Inisheen that he was ·
thinking of—it was the Kitty who had stretched her warm,
trembling little hand to him, across the stream down in the
darkness, and repeated the pledge that gave each to the
other, and looked up and kissed him when the lovers'
vows were over. Was this the same Kitty?
But she could not have changed so. He would not
believe it. Kitty had been put out of temper by something ;
and at such times she wrote hurriedly, a little incoherently,
sometimes heedless of her grammar even. What he would
do would be to take the matter in his own hands. He
would go and get hold of Kitty herself—that was the first
thing. Once he had a grip of her small, warm fingers, he
should feel safe. Poor lass, she had become petulant
through being left so much alone. He would press back
the hair from her forehead, and smile away the evil spirit
from her eyes.
But it suddenly struck him that she had not said where
she was going. Was he to lose all clue to her whereabouts,
then? Was she to remain for an indefinite time in this
petulant mood? Then a strange sort of fear-that seemed
to go through his heart like a red-hot wire-stabbed him,
as it were ; and in a blind and bewildered way he went
down the stairs, and went in to Ross's studio.
“Ross,” said he—and Ross certainly stared at him, for
his manner was unusual, “I wouldn't show you a love-
letter ; but this isn't much of a love-letter. I wish you
would look at it and tell me what you think."
He seemed rather breathless.
“Have you had any quarrel ?” said John Ross, when
he had read the letter slowly and carefully.
“Quarrel ? Not a shadow of a quarrel !" he said
eagerly

* Will I tell ye what I think?" said his friend, watching
his expression closely.
“Why not? Why not? That's what I want.”
“I think that young lass is going to marry another
man."
Fitzgerald reached out his hand, and took back the letter.
“ You are quite wrong," he said quietly, but with his face
very gray and haggard. “You are quite mistaken about
that. You don't know my—my darling."
He went away without another word; and Ross knew
enough not to follow him.
His faithfulness fought on to the end. He would not
believe it. It was not in human nature. The heart of a
woman could not be so treacherous. It was not possible
for the Kitty whom he had clasped to his breast on the
shore there at Inisheen-when her face was wet with tears
in the moonlight—it was not possible for that Kitty to be
gaily smiling a love-smile into other eyes. He had heard
her heart beat.
There came a letter :
“Dublin, Tuesday.
"DEAR MR. FITZGERALD—In the hurry of packing, I
have been commissioned to acquaint you with a piece of
news, which I fear will cause you some pain, though prob-
ably but little surprise. Miss Romayne is to be married
to Mr. Cobbs to-morrow morning ; and I believe they go
to the Isle of Man afterwards, where Mr. Cobbs has some
friends. For my part, I must say I am heartily glad of it ;
for, although Miss Romayne has always been kind to me,
and remains so, her successive flirtations have only caused
me embarrassment; and I have often been suspected of
influencing her to favour this one or reject the other,
when in truth I took no interest at all in such trivial
matters. What I cannot help regretting is the £40 that
will have to be paid to the Limerick people for her can-
celling the engagement; but Mr. Cobbs has plenty of
money, and probably they regard that as a small matter
now. I have some things to send back to you; but can-
not get a proper box before the morning. It shall be
registered. -Yours sincerely,
E. PATIENCE.”

There was one word added to this letter—in another
and trembling handwriting. It was in a corner. It was
the word “ Forgive."
The drowning man, we have often been told, sees all
the chief events of his life pass before him—a procession
of clear and startling pictures—in time limited to seconds.
This man saw wild and sudden visions too—as he bent
forward his brow on his clasped hands—but these rapid,
bewildering, heart-breaking scenes had always for their
central figure a woman. All the rest of his life was for-
gotten. The beautiful pictures !— filled with the colour
and sunlight of young love and hope ; and ever in the
midst of them—whether by sea or shore, in rocky glen or
on the breezy hillside-some one laughing with parted lips
and smiling with glad eyes. But then this other vision
that would intrude : it was like the dreadful thing that
Heine saw: “That was a merry bridal-feast-joyfully the
guests sat at the table—but when I regarded the bridal
pair-Ah, God, my darling was the bride !"
Was the blow unexpected, then? No. For days and
weeks he had been living under the shadow of this name?
less fear. It had been like a black cloud over him; he i
would not look at it; he tried to escape from it; he tried :
to argue it out of existence. He would not confess to a
doubt of Kitty's honour and faith ; had she not kissed him,
by the side of the stream, where they had plighted their
troth together?
And now he had nothing to say about perjured lips, or
woman's deceit, or anything of the kind. The wound had .
struck deeper than that. It had struck at the very founda-
tions of his faith in human nature. Rather vaguely and
thoughtfully—for these pictures of Inisheen were still before
his eyes—he got his hat and stick, and went out into the
mild summer air. The day was fine; the people seemed
busy. He only knew that life was over for him; that the
world had nothing left for him—except, it might be, a few
memories; he was without interest, or care, or hope
though the lad had scarcely touched his four-and-twentieth
year,

CHAPTER XXIII.
“SIE TRAGEN ZU DIR, O GELIEBTE !”
It is mid-day on the first of June; the skies are clear;.
and this old-fashioned coach goes jolting, and rattling, and
swinging away through the lonely country that lies between
Drimoleague and Bantry Bay. The warm summer air is
sweetened, now with the fragrance of the abundant honey-
suckle, now with a whiff of peat-smoke from one of those
poor stone hovels near the wayside. There are plenty of
beautiful things to charm the eye of the traveller. There
are masses of blue forget-me-nots in the marshy pools.
The waste bog-land has its own rich hues; and these rude
stone walls that enclose the miserable bit of farm or garden
are surmounted by golden gorse. Even the far-reaching
sterile hills, where the scant pasturage scarcely tints the
barren rock, have their qualities of colour that a painter
might observe. For the day is beautiful; the air is clear ;
and the sunshine falls so strongly that the shadows under
the hedgerows or under a steep bank seem quite black-
and not yet the opaque black that a palette would give-
but a sensitive, deep-reaching, luminous blackness that
reveals things within itself, and that is cut across, outside,
by the sharp-pointed spears of the iris, a brilliant deep
strong green in the sunlight.
The solitary passenger by this mail-coach regards these
things with a minute and close and mechanical attention ;
perhaps he forces himself so to regard them. He has
come through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, as it
were; there is a black cloud behind him, and he durst

not look that way; he busies himself, and strives to busy
himself, with the phenomena of the visible world around
him. And while he fondly imagines that he is contem-
plating these phenomena with the calm and dispassionate
eye of an artist-looking at the waste bog-land, and the
poor hovels, and the sad far hills, with a view to guessing
at their value in colour-in reality he is reading human
sorrow, and the tragedy of human life, into every sight and
sound that meets him.
But the first glimpse of the broad waters of Bantry Bay
made his heart leap with pain. Visions and dreams that
had occupied days not so far bygone seemed to dazzle his
eyes—for a moment, but only for a moment. With a
terrible effort he put them away. He would not confess
to that quick sharp quiver at the heart. He was studying
this beautiful picture as John Ross might have studied
it. Look at the great width of the sea, with its armlets
stretching in between the sunny browns and greens of the
headlands. So still is the summer air, so calm and clear
is the summer sky, that the blue of these far-reaching arms
of water is a dull and almost opaque blue-a sort of
sealing-wax blue--looking molten and heavy in the spaces
between the wooded islands and the rocks. The hills on
the other side, that stretch away out to the lonely Atlantic,
seem desolate and uninhabited. It is a sad picture, despite
the loveliness of the summer day. But if one wishes to
lose oneself—to get away from the world—to seek out the
secret haunts of nature, and find solace and forgetfulness
there+surely these remote shores, these voiceless hills and
glens, may afford a resting-place for the tortured soul ?
He had to encounter strange faces at Glengariff. At
the pretty hotel there, which from a distance seemed to
be half-smothered among trees and flowers and shrubs, he
found a number of the visitors sitting outside, some having
afternoon tea at small tables, others playing chess, or
smoking or chatting; and doubtless they would regard
the new-comer with sufficient curiosity. No matter; he
was soon inside ; and there he asked if he might have a
room for the night.
“Mr. Fitzgerald, I presume ?” said the landlady.

in the me you wo eles coming to
“ That is my name," said he, with some astonish-
ment.
“A room has been kept for you," she said ; and Fitz-
gerald could only ask himself why he had been astonished,
for indeed the thoughtfulness and kindness of those Chet-
wynds went beyond all bounds.
“I suppose," said he, “I can get the Castletown mail-car
in the morning ?”
“But you won't need that, sir," said the good landlady,
“ for the carriage is coming from Boat of Garry for you at
half-past ten, if that is convenient. I was to give you the
message from Mr. M'Gee. Mr. M'Gee has been down to
Boat of Garry to see that everything is in readiness for
you; and I was to say that he was very sorry he could not
stay to meet you here, as he had important business at
Kenmare to-day.” .
“Oh, indeed."
“Visitors' book, sir," said a waiter, opening a large
volume that lay on the hall table.
· “Oh yes," said Fitzgerald, and he mechanically took
the pen and wrote his name.
Then he lingered, glancing over the other names on the
page, as is the fashion of new arrivals. He had his finger
and thumb on the leaf, as if he meant to pursue this aimless
enquiry; when all at once he seemed to recall himself; he
shut the book hastily, and turned, as if afraid that some
one had been watching him. Then he went to his room,
and remained there until dinner-time. He sat at the open
window, looking at the beautiful foliage, and listening to
the birds; and trying to think of nothing but these. He
would not confess to himself what sudden and frightful
suspicion it was that had made him so hurriedly shut the
visitors' book; nor yet would he ask what new weight this
was on his heart—this terrible consciousness that, sooner
or later, before he left the house, he would be irresistibly
drawn to search those pages.
At dinner he sat next a vivacious little old gentleman
with a thin dried pale face and a brown wig, an Englishman,
whose pleasant chatting, if it was not very wise or profound,
served to beguile the time. He gave Fitzgerald a vast

amount of information about the neighbourhood. He had
his views also.
“What is the highest form of human happiness ?” he
asked abruptly.
“Killing a brace of ducks right and left," said Fitzgerald,
for the sake of saying something.
“Oh no. These are violent enjoyments, and violent
enjoyments are invariably accompanied by violent disap-
pointments. It is the attainment of peace and content,
which is only possible after the wild passions and pursuits
of youth are over; and what does it depend on? Sound
sleep, mostly. I mean to live to ninety."
“I am sure I hope you may,” said his neighbour.
“I think I shall. I see no reason to the contrary," said
the cheerful old gentleman. “I cultivate happiness and
health at the same time; indeed, I find them to be the
same thing. The only stimulant I allow myself in the day
-the only thing that rises a little above the level—is the
dinner hour. I permit myself that; and find no harm in
it. Now when I was your age, I did as most young fellows
did at that time—that is to say, without being a drunkard,
I drank too much. A brandy and soda in the morning; a
pint of claret at lunch; perhaps a glass of Madeira in the
afternoon; then the usual wine at dinner. What was the
result? There was no novelty in it. There was no
pleasant stimulus. The system was too familiar with these
repeated excitements. And so nowadays I drink nothing
but tea or soda-water up till dinner-time ; and then I have
my pint of champagne; and my whole system enjoys this
unwonted stimulus; and perhaps I may even grow talka-
tive, eh?”
“But about the sound sleep—you have not told me
how you secure that,” said Fitzgerald. So long as this old
gentleman would talk, he was glad to listen.
“I will tell you; I should like to proclaim it from the
house-tops," said the other, seriously. “It is by having an
occupation for all idle hours; an occupation sufficient to
fix your attention, so that you can pass a rainy morning
without fretting ; an occupation sufficient to distract your
mind in the evening-I mean the last hour or so before

going to bed—and yet leave no puzzling questions behind
to disturb you. Now my occupation is to read carefully
and strictly through, from one end to the other, the
Encyclopædia Britannica—not one of the new editions,
which might have modern speculation in it; but the edition
of 1812, in forty half-volumes. I am quite sufficiently
interested for the moment in Abergavenny, in Abruzzo, in
Abyssinia, or Aquilaus; but yet not so eagerly as to interfere
with my sleep; and when I have got away through to the
end of the fortieth volume, I can begin again with my
memory free from a single fact. But this I allow myself,
I must tell you. I allow myself the use of a number of
small hieroglyphics that I put in as I go on; and when I
come to one of them again I say to myself, 'Why, the last
time I read this I was in Mrs. Scott's inn at Boscastle, and
what a storm was blowing !' or perhaps another tells me
that when I read this paragraph I was at Ben Rhydding,
just come back from a stroll across the moors; or perhaps
at the Bell Inn at Henley, when all the confusion of the
boat-races was about
“You seem to spend a good part of your life in hotels,"
suggested Fitzgerald.
“All of it—the whole of it, my young friend," was the
prompt reply. “Why should I have the trouble of keeping
a house? I have that done for me by those who have had
most experience of it of any people in the country. Where
should I have peace and quiet if I were worrying about
servants and smoky chimneys ? Why should I bother
about cooking? If I do not like the cooking, or the bed-
rooms, or the direction of the wind, I go away elsewhere;
I could not do that if I were tied to one house and ham-
pered with my own servants. I agree with Shenstone. I
know where to find a warm welcome. I can fit my habita-
tion to the season of the year; at one time I am in the Isle
of Wight, at another in the West Highlands. I may say
that England, Scotland, and Ireland form my house; and
I have a noble staff of servants—in numbers, at all events
—who please me tolerably well. And you—at your time
of life one does not travel for pleasure. May I be so im-
pertinent as to ask what your business or profession may be?”

"I don't know that I have any just at the present mo-
ment,” said Fitzgerald, absently. “I have been thinking
of going to America."
“Ah,” said his neighbour, regarding him with curiosity.
“You know the saying, 'America is here or nowhere.'”
“That is from Wilhelm Meister," said Fitzgerald (it was
a wonder to himself how glad he was to talk to this old
gentleman, in however mechanical a fashion : the journey
had been a lonesome one). “And I never could under-
stand Wilhelm Meister. But I suppose as it is an epigram
it must be clever. What I know is that here the Govern-
ment won't give you one hundred and sixty acres of freehold
land for five shillings an acre.”
“You mean to farm, then ? Pardon me, but—but I
should not have thought that would be congenial occupation.
You spoke of Wilhelm Meister," said the old gentleman,
in his precise and courteous way. “What do you think
of Werther, then? He was a great favourite among the
young people when I was a youth.”
“I like him still less," was Fitzgerald's frank reply
(though his eyes sometimes wandered away, as though he
were looking at other and distant things). “I don't like
hothouse sentiment. I don't think a man could go on
loving a woman whose eyes were quite cold and indifferent
towards him-concerned about bread and butter, in fact,
If she had once loved him, even before her marriage, that
would have been different. I can understand a man going
on through his life constant to his love for a woman who
has once loved him, and whom he has lost. I mean," he
added hastily, “by death. I mean one who has been
taken away from him by death; and whose memory is a
life-long treasure. I don't pity him ; I think he is lucky.”
“What?" said the old gentleman, “lucky to have lost
his sweetheart.”
“Yes, before he found her out,” said Fitzgerald, quite
simply—and even absently. “Then nothing can upset his
idol. She is always beautiful to him, and true; he can
have no suspicion of her; and when she has been always
good and true and believable, he thinks other women may
be. That is something. That is, when she dies in time

“SIE TRAGEN ZU DIR, O GELIEBTE !” 289
before she has degraded herself—before she has shown
him what lies women's eyes can tell- "
“I say, my young friend, that is a very extraordinary
theory for one of your age to hold," said his neighbour,
staring at him.
The blood rushed to Fitzgerald's forehead; he had been
talking almost to himself.
“ Oh,” said he, hastily, “there is something in what you
say, about America. Of course one would want a certain
amount of capital. But the land along the Platte valley is
excellent; and I fancy that these pre-emption grants are
free from taxation
“But have you any practical experience in farming, may
I ask ?” said his neighbour.
Now Fitzgerald was so glad to get away from that other
topic on which he had haplessly stumbled that he began.
and gave this old gentleman a very fair notion of the state
of his affairs — of his struggles to obtain a place in the
London literary world, and so forth. He named no names,
except the names of newspapers.
“It is to me a very interesting story, for a reason I will
tell you presently,” said his companion. “May I ask if
you chanced to meet Mr. Noel ?”
Mr. Noel was the editor of a great daily newspaper in
London, and his name was pretty well known.
“No, I never did," said Fitzgerald.
“Perhaps you did not apply to him ?”
“No-I had no means of introducing myself-even if
I had thought- "
“Ah! Well, you see, it happens that I am one of the
proprietors of the Daily Mirror, and I should be delighted
to give you a note of introduction to Mr. Noel.”
Of course Fitzgerald expressed his gratitude for this
friendly offer; but rather avoided accepting it. He had
learned one or two of the lessons of life. His imagination
was not so sanguine now. The time was over when a
chance conversation in an Irish inn could suddenly reveal
to him a roseate path to fame and fortune. And besides,
what would be the use of an introduction ? Supposing he
were to be allowed to write for that great newspaper, what

then ? For whom? Towards what end? Who was to
care? He had what money he wanted; the struggle was
over; he had no ambition to make his voice heard amid
the discordant roar of London—even if it could reach all
the way from the solitudes of Boat of Garry.
Nevertheless he felt very grateful to this old gentleman
for the distraction his conversation had afforded during
dinner; for it was with a renewed and agitated fear that he
passed quickly by the small table in the hall where the visitors'
book lay. For one brief second he paused, half determined
to brave the discovery, and free his mind from this lurking
and intolerable dread; and then again he turned, mastering
his vacillation, and resolved to give way to no such weak-
ness. Of what concern was it to him ? Let the dead past
bury its dead. He had put that black cloud behind him.
His business was the present. And here, on this lovely
summer evening, amid the quiet beauties of Glengariff, was
there not enough to occupy his attention ? He would do
as these others were doing; only he rather wanted to get
away from them, and be alone.
He got a boat; told the boatman he might go where he
pleased ; and was glad to be away from the shore, and in
silence. Was it because the silence was so intense that
now and again sonie air of an old familiar song seemed to
come floating across the abyss of time, speaking of other
nights and other scenes that his heart remembered? This
was not Inisheen; this was Glengariff. Look at the beau-
tiful still bay; at the wooded islands; at the solemn hills.
Far up in the north-western heavens there is still a yellow
glow of twilight; here along the shore everything is pale
and cold and clear. In under the islands the water is of a
glassy blackness; but the ripples catch the glow from the
sky; and the black is barred with sharp lines of gold. A
heavy splash out there tells that a salmon has leapt; the
young herons high up in the trees croak as they are getting
their evening meal; in by the rocks, under the bushes, the
gray wet back of an otter comes up again and again silently
to the surface until he finally disappears. Then they turn
seaward (a white ghost of a heron rises from a creek and
shows itself for a second or two crossing the shadows) and

make away down by a Martello tower; the night deepening
in silence; a faint gray mist gathering along the lower hills ;
the twilight still strong enough to show, far away, the large
mainsail of a yacht lying at her moorings—a phantom thing
on the dark expanse of sea. And then slowly home again,
over the clear shallows; and as one nears the landing-place,
a slight stirring of wind brings a scent of roses—from the
hedge there. It is a gracious evening. The stars come
out one by one; the silver sickle of the moon has arisen in
the south; there is just enough of ripple along the shores
to make a soft and continuous murmur. And the roses
make sweet the night air,
But what was this that went through his heart like fire ?
He was standing by the rose-hedge alone-for nearly all
the people had gone indoors—dreamily listening to the low
murmur of the water. But this other sound? There were
two people coming along the road, and but vaguely seen
in the gathering darkness; and they were quietly singing
together one of Mendelssohn's duets. Did he not know
it?—the pain, and the sweetness, and the longing of it !
And then, somehow, a bewilderment seized him : surely if
he were to hasten away at this moment—if he were to
hasten away to Cork and ascend the hill and enter the
small house there, he would find that all this black night-
mare had only been a ghastly dream. It could not be that
Kitty was a traitor— that she had gone away from him-
Kitty whose eyes had looked into his, who had pledged her
life and her love to him in the glen at Inisheen, who had
trembled in his arms, and sobbed, and kissed him, as she
bade him good-bye at the shore. He would escape from
this frightful thing; he would go to Kitty herself. And
the next second a sudden, strange transformation takes
place; he is in a vision ; Glengariff has disappeared; he is
at Cork; this is Audley Place! Look —he opens the
small iron gate, and goes up the pathway, and rings the
bell. The sound of the piano within ceases; it is Kitty's
footstep that is in the lobby. “Well, sir, have you come
for your singing lesson?” “I have come for a great many
lessons, Kitty." They go hand-in-hand into the warm little
room; Miss Patience is absent; the piano is open. “Which

one?” says Kitty. "O wert thou in the cauld blast ?'
No; you can manage that pretty well. Some day, when
literature gives out, we may have to sing that together in a
concert-room ; and then you'll see whether anybody else can
give you a lead with the accompaniment as well as I can.
No; we'll try 'Oh would that my love were whispered.'
Now let my hair alone; and attend to your business; and
please don't bawl as if you were at Limerick races; but
sing as if you were singing to me-at night and just us
two in the whole world - "
[Surely, if these two people—no doubt young people
fond enough of each other— who were at this moment
coming along the road to the Glengariff Hotel, could have
known what agony they were inflicting on one who wished
not to listen but who could not refuse to listen, surely they
would have ceased their careless humming of the old
familiar air. ]
He is standing by Kitty's side. She strikes the first
notes of the music; and he loses his voice in hers, so
anxious is he to hear her :
" Oh would that my love were whispered
To thee in a single sigh;
Or murmuring in sweetest music,
On swift zephyr's wing could fly
On zephyr's wing "
The music stops.
“Dear me,” she says, “what are you doing? What
business have you with that? Don't you see that's mine?
I believe you are singing by ear; and not looking at the
words at all—-"
“They are not worth much when you do look at them,
are they, Kitty ?” he says.
“ That is not my business, nor yours," she answers, with
the asperity of a music-mistress. “We have got to sing
the duet; you can criticise the poetry afterwards. Now,
you come in at the proper place—and leave my hair alone,
will you ? Miss Patience asked me if I had combed it with
a furze-bush the other night. Now- "
And so they finish that verse, and get through the next
very fairly. But presently, when they come to-

"SIE TRAGEN ZU DIR, O GELIEBTE !" 293
by thi thoué care duet z
" And even in the depths of thy slumber,
When night spreads her shadowy beams-
Kitty finds herself singing alone. She ceases, and turns
round and lifts up her soft pretty black eyes in astonishment
and affected anger.
“Well? What is it now? Why have you stopped ?"
“It is so much nicer to hear you singing alone, Kitty ;
I don't want to spoil it.”
“Am I to sing a duet by myself?”
“I don't care what it is, so long as you sing it."
“I thought you might have had enough of my singing
by this time."
“Perhaps you will be thinking that I have had enough
of you?"
“That's what you will be saying some day, at all events,"
she answers saucily. “And soon enough. Oh, I know
what men are. Sighing their lives out over a little bit of
your hair ; and then you marry them, and before you know
where you are they wouldn't walk the length of a draper's
shop to buy a pair of gloves for you."
“But you have not been married so very many times,
Kitty ?"
“Don't be absurd. I speak from observation. And I
know you'll be just like the rest. But never mind; it's
very nice in the meantime; and you're looking such a
bonny boy to-night; and—and, in fact, I'm going to be
very kind to you, as I always am, and make you miserable,
and if you will have the goodness to fetch me that book
over there, I will sing you something so very heartrending."
He places his hand on her shoulder.
“And do you really think, Kitty, that we may grow
indifferent to each other?”
“Don't tease; but bring the book.”
“ I want you to look at me and say so. I know what
you mean when I see your eyes."
She keeps down her head.
“For I have heard strange things since I went to
London; but about women only. I have heard it said
that a woman's eyes are always wandering ; that if you look
down a table d'hôte you will soon find that out; that it is

not safe to leave a woman by herself who has a loving
heart ; that she is likely, in your absence, to become gently
interested in somebody else- "
She removes his hand from her shoulder, with a quick
gesture.
“ It isn't true, Kitty ?" he says, with gentleness.
“I know the man you mean—and I hate him !" she
answers fiercely.
“It isn't true, then, that women are like that?”.
And then-ah! the thought of it !she leaps to her feet,
and seizes his arms, and there is a proud indignation in the
white, upturned, quivering face; and there is something
like tears in the black, soft eyes, and the pretty lips are
tremulous.
“Read my eyes, read my heart and my soul; and say
if you can think such a thing of me !"
And then-
But this dream of what was bygone was like madness to
the brain ; he could no longer think of it; and happily
these two people had passed into the house, and he was
once more alone with the silence of the night.
Even here he could find no rest; the darkness was too
full of pictures. He passed into the warm light of the
hotel; and in the hall met the old gentleman who had
talked with him at dinner and who was now chatting with
the landlady.
“Ah, here you are, I see; I have been wondering where
you had got to. Here is the letter to Mr. Noel.”
“Oh, I am very much obliged to you."
“You will find him a most excellent fellow; and it is
not often I try his good-nature in this way.”
“I think you are doing too much for a stranger," said
Fitzgerald, frankly. “I know something of newspaper-
offices. I know editors are not fond of letters of introduc-
tion. Supposing that I were to begin and pester the life
out of this poor man?".
“Oh, I am not afraid," said the old gentleman, good-
naturedly. “Something in your conversation at dinner
showed me you had an old head on young shoulders. You
will see," he added, speaking in a lower voice, and, in fact,

295
in a somewhat mysterious manner, “that I have written
to Mr. Noel merely as a friend. There are a number of
proprietors, you understand, and as our interests might be
diverse, we have agreed never to intermeddle with the con-
duct of the paper, except on such large points as the board
may be summoned to consider."
“I hope," said Fitzgerald, pleasantly, “that the declara-
tion of dividends is one of those large points.”
“Marvellous !” said the other, putting a finger on his
companion's arm to emphasise his tragic whisper. “Mar-
vellous. Not a word to a human soul; but last half-year
the manager announced to us a dividend of forty-three per
cent on the original capital ! Think of that! Now, of
course, we don't want to intermeddle with a concern that
is paying like that; and this note does not recommend
you as a writer to Mr. Noel, but merely tells him that I
had the pleasure of meeting you at the table d'hôte here,
that you knew something of literary affairs, and asking to
be allowed to introduce you. That is all. You under-
stand ?”
“Oh, perfectly. I am very much obliged to you."
“Although I am a pretty withered old stick myself,"
said the old gentleman, facetiously, “I believe in the in-
fusion of new blood—so does our manager,-a most shrewd
and excellent man. 'New blood,' I say to him : 'When
you can get it,' says he. Now I am off to my final
hour at the Encyclopædia. Where was I? Oh yes, at
London: the account of the great fire, very interesting, I
assure you. But,” he added, with impressiveness, “not too
interesting. I shall not sleep any the less soundly to-night
because I have been reading about the baker's shop in
Pudding Lane."
“Good-night to you, then," said Fitzgerald.
“But not yet, if you are coming into the drawing-room.
Of course you are; there are some charming young ladies
there. I have my volume there, too; their chatting or
singing does not interrupt me; on the contrary, is it not a
pleasant variety to look up from Ancient Thebes or the
wars of Alexander and see a nicely-rounded cheek and
pretty eyelids bent over a book ? I always keep my volume

there, though once or twice the wicked young creatures
have hidden it out of mischief.”
So he went off and into the warm, bright little drawing-
room ; and Fitzgerald was left in the hall. He had a
reason for lingering—which he dared scarcely confess to
himself.
“You have a good many people here,” he said, cheer-
fully, to the landlady or manageress, "for this time of the
year.”
“Oh yes, sir. It is rather a favourite time. Many
people like to go through and see Killarney while some of
the hawthorn is still out."
He was turning over the visitors' book, his face and
manner careless, his heart throbbing with a nameless
dread.
“Is Boat of Garry a pretty place ?” he asked.
“Oh yes, sir ; I believe so, sir; I have never been there
myself.”
He did not hear that answer. He had come to three
names, two of them bracketed together; all written in the
same hand-
Miss Romayne . . . } Cork.
Miss Patience . . .
E. L. Cobbs... Liverpool.
He shut the book quickly, without looking round; he
dared not show the landlady his ghastly face. He took
refuge in the drawing-room, concealing himself in a corner,
with his hands clenched on the newspaper he held up
before him : the letters he saw before him seemed to be
printed in blood. And then there was a kind of suffocation
in the air of the place; was not the night hot? Some
people were laughing; it was a strange sound. A chord
was struck on the piano; and there was silence. Two
voices were heard—two girls' voices—one soprano, the
other contralto—and what must they sing but “O wert
thou in the cauld blast"? His clenched hands were
trembling; the agony was too great. But he managed to
read on—such reading !_such blind, wild fixing the eyes
on words that had no meaning—until the musical piece
was finished ; and then he slunk out, his face averted, from

in all here must he many lossing
80t a these
the room, and found safety, and coolness, and time to
think, in his small apartment upstairs.
But even here, as he sat down, strange fancies that he
strove to banish caine into his head. Why did he look so
intently at the window-sill, at the dressing-table, at the
mirror? The mirror can reflect many faces; but no trace
remains. This bedroom must have been breathed in by
many a visitor; but here was the sweet fresh air of the
night blowing in at the open window. What idle fancies
were these? The room was but as another room. He
got a book, held it up against the light, and began to
read.
He read nothing. The window was still open; the soft
night-air blowing in; and yet the room seemed to choke
him. And then all at once he seemed to know that Kitty
had occupied this room. She had kissed her lover out
there in the passage; she had come in here to be alone
with her perjured heart; she had looked in the mirror to see
whether her eyes had been lying as bewitchingly as was
their wont. These were the eyes with which she had
sought him out when, breathless and smiling, she had
come down to the Cork station to see him away—glad, no
doubt, that he was going, and knowing that he would
trouble her no more. She had taken back her love, her
pledged love, from him ; but she could give him a basket ;
and salad cut with her own hands! Was she not kind? Was
she not generous ? Had she not a woman's thoughtfulness
and pretty consideration and affectionate ways ? He could
see her smiling, and kissing her hand to him, and waving
her handkerchief, as the train slowly left the station; she
was thankful, no doubt, she had escaped ; she had got
through the hypocrisy; her eyes had met his, but he had
not read down deep enough, nor seen the treachery of her
heart.
The air of this room seemed contaminated; he could
not remain in it. Was it on that window-sill there that
she had leaned her arms, on the still morning, and looked
out? Oh, her eyes were pretty enough : any one passing
along the road and noticing her would say that was a
charming enough face. Any kisses to sell this morning, fair

young lady ?-it seems these things are bought nowadays.
Is the price high? Must one hail from Manchester, or
Liverpool, or some such commercial place, before one can
become a purchaser ? Hearts, too: do they find quick
buyers, seeing they are so easily transferable ? Bah !-
she is no woman fit for a man's love—throw her out to
the dogs, the smirking Jezebel !
He puts down his book; he has not been reading
much.
Why this contempt, then ? Why this scorn of poor
Kitty, who (when she was at Inisheen, at least) did her
best to be loving? Poor little Kitty; the small, trembling,
over-fond heart mistook its strength. No doubt she
wished to be steadfast and true. Perhaps she tried for a
time. But she was a creature of the sunshine; the warm
little heart went dancing and fluttering on; what was it
to her that behind her lay a man's broken life?
No, he could not remain in this room ; the objects in
it were horrible; the air stifled him. He went downstairs
again ; got hold of somebody to whom he made the excuse
of sleeplessness; and so had the door opened, and went
out wandering into the darkness.
And now a breeze had sprung up in the south; and all
the night was awake. The wind murmured and trembled
through the dark branches of the trees; there was a sound
along the shore; and the sad mother earth was listening to
the wail of her daughter the sea. Only far away in the
stars—those calm, and shining, and benignant orbs — did
there seem to be peace; if only one could reach them
through the gateway of the grave.

CHAPTER XXIV.
ALONE.
Next morning the little old gentleman with the dried-up
face and the brown wig was standing in the verandah out-
side the hotel when the Boat of Garry carriage-a large
open landau, with a pair of smart-looking grays—drove up.
to the door, and Fitzgerald came out. Master Willie, who
had been taught by John Ross to observe the expressions
of the human face as closely as the colours of palings
and of Chelsea cabbage-gardens, instantly perceived that
his friend and patron of the preceding evening was sur-
prised — more than that, that he seemed to have some
misgiving.
“ This isn't newspaper work I am engaged on at present,"
said the younger man, promptly, as his luggage was being
handed up to the coachman on the box. “I am going as
a sort of land-agent or surveyor, to see whether a house and
a shooting down here are all right, before they are offered
to a tenant."
“Oh, I see," the old gentleman remarked, as he scanned
the turn-out. “He won't find fault with the carriage, at
all events. A landau is the proper sort of carriage for this
changeable sort of climate; but heavy, eh, on the hilly
roads? They seem a strong pair of beasts, though.”
“Good-bye,” said Fitzgerald, as he shook hands with
him. “If ever I have the courage to try the newspapers
again, I may make use of the note of introduction you
were kind enough to give me.”
“ It will be an easier experiment than going out to Ne-

braska for your 160 acres of land, eh?
Don't you think
sop”
Then Fitzgerald got into the landau ; and when the near
horse (whose name he afterwards discovered to be Welling-
ton) had reared and pranced on the ground for a bit, off
went both of them like a bolt from a bow, apparently well
accustomed to the weight of this spacious carriage. The
morning was fine, though there was a strange luminous
opacity in the air—a sort of thin sea-fog suffused with sun-
light—that hung over the woods and hills like a tender
bridal veil. The air was soft to the cheeks; the warm
wind was from the south. If this were to be banishment,
it was banishment to a very beautiful and gracious part of
the world.
And indeed, as Fitzgerald lay back in the soft, blue-
cushioned carriage, he had an uneasy sense that the whole
performance was very much like setting a beggar on horse-
back. He regarded the two white buttons on the brown
coat of the coachman; and wondered whether he could not
induce the human being within that garment to be a little
more companionable, and less elaborately respectful. So
he hit on the device of adding a trifle to his Irish accent;
and he perceived that, by slow degrees, the coachman, who
was a good-looking man of about thirty, permitted a more
friendly look to come into his eyes when answering ques-
tions. At last Fitzgerald said to him-
“What is your name, now?"
“Murtough Dunne, sorr.”
“But what do they generally call you ?"
“Murtough, sorr."
“Very well, then, Murtough ; you stop the horses for a
minute, and I'll get out and come up on the box; for I
want you to tell me about the country.”
“As ye plase, sorr.”
So Fitzgerald got up on the box; but he knew better
than to begin on the subject of topography. He praised
the look of the grays. Wellington, he discovered, was the
showier of the two, and always made a little fuss about
starting ; but Dan was the one for real hard work. Dan
had taken the dog-cart sixty miles in one day-over bad

country—and was as fresh as paint after it. Dan was his
honour's favourite. But indeed—as appeared from hints
continually cropping up in this desultory talk about horses,
and carriages, and hay, and shooting-parties, and what not
—his honour, that is to say, the late owner of the place, seemed
to have had a great many favourites, both among the human
beings and the animals around him, and to have left behind
him a reputation for constant kindness and consideration.
He was quick-tempered, it appeared ; but his wrath was
over with a word; and there was nothing the people round
about would not do to serve him and to please him.
“ That made it easy for the keeper, then ?” said Fitz-
gerald. “No trampling of nests in the spring—no chasing
of leverets by the dogs ?"
“True for you, sorr," said the coachman. “There was
John O'Leary, up at the Knockgarvan farm, and he had a
dog-sure, sorr, there never was such a rascal for hunting,
and worrying, and shtaling—both bird and baste. What
does he do but bring down the dog, wid a string round his
neck, and ties him up in the yard, and laves word for his
honour to shoot him or drown him as he plased. Bedad,
says Micky "
“But who is Micky ?".
“Sure the keeper, sorr! 'Bedad,' says he, ‘his honour
will do neither the one nor the other whin he comes home;
and wid your lave I'll get rid of the baste mysilf.'”
“And I suppose the gentleman up at Knockgarvan ex-
pected a little compensation ?” Fitzgerald said, suspiciously.
Murtough grinned, and said nothing.
“How much was it ?”
“I tink it was tree pounds, sorr, his honour gave him ;
and the cur not worth the sound of a sixpence !”
In this way Fitzgerald managed to obtain a large amount
of information about Boat of Garry and its neighbourhood;
and the long drive-through occasional woods, or along
high and stony hill-roads (with always the far Atlantic in
the south)—was rendered cheerful enough. He made it
a matter of business to obtain these particulars. He had
undertaken a commission, as it were. And he tried hard
to devote his whole time and thinking to this duty; so that

amongst enquiries about the price of oais, and the probable
introduction of hay-drying machines, and the different kinds
of nails for horseshoes, and so forth, other and less immediate
things might be definitely shut out and forgotten. Was not
this a new and strange experience for him—to be installed
as master of a house that he had never seen? How would
he get on with the other people about? This man seemed
civil and honest, and was now rather more friendly, while
always preserving a careful respect. And he could report
that he, at least, had not been neglectful of his duties: the
horses seemed in excellent condition; the metal of the
harness was brilliantly polished; the carriage throughout
was as spick and span as it could be much more so than
is at all common with carriages in remote parts of the
country where they get rough and constant usage.
By-and-by, however, the sunlight seemed to withdraw
itself from the thin mist ; it grew darker a little; then the
moisture in the air was felt in points; at last a fine rain
began to fall.
“Will your honour be for going inside now?” Murtough
asked.
“Oh no," was the answer. “But I will hold the reins
while you close the carriage. I know the south of Ireland.
Besides, I have a waterproof.”
And very soon he had to put on that waterproof; for
the soft small rain now fell steadily; and the outlines of
the hills and the reaches of the lake were blurred over or
altogether invisible; and the skies were growing dark.
Murtough had a waterproof also; but he did not seem to
think this rain sufficient to injure his livery. So the pair
of grays trotted on monotonously, or splashed through
puddles; and the rain fell more slightly or more closely
as the clouds came drifting over from the hills; and all
the time Fitzgerald was interesting himself in particulars
about the Boat of Garry household or asking the name of
this or that feature in the ever-changing and widening
and dripping landscape.
At length there was a sharp dip down from the high
road, and they passed through an avenue of trees. Here
the landau dragged heavily through the mud; and there

was a pattering of big rain-drops from the branches. Then
they swung into the open again ; passed through an open
iron gate; drove briskly along a pathway of wet gravel ;
and drew up at the door of the house of which Fitzgerald
was to be the temporary master.
It was a plain, square, two-storied building, with an
unpretentious porch of wood and glass. The shrubbery
around the bit of lawn looked trim and well cared for;
there was no sign of neglect about the place. And when,
leaving his dripping waterproof in the porch, he walked
into the hall, and then into the dining-room (where there
was a fire, despite the fact that the weather had been un-
usually warm, even for the first week in June) everything
around seemed neat and clean and well looked after. There
was not the slightest air of neglect about the place; on the
contrary, one would have expected a trim house-mistress to
make her appearance to welcome the visitor. There were
preparations for luncheon on the table. There was a pair
of slippers on the fender. Beside the easy-chair at the
corner of the fireplace stood a smaller table, on which some
books and old magazines were methodically arranged.
"I beg your pardon, sir,” some one said at the door.
The voice sent the blood to his heart— it was so like
another voice that he now regarded as being beyond the
grave. He turned quickly. But this person was merely a
quiet-looking, rather pretty young woman of about six or
eight and twenty, whose black hair and blue eyes made him
conclude she was Irish. But then he recollected. Was
not this the English maid whose fellow-seryants, according
to Mrs. Chetwynd, had considered to have made such a
frightful mésalliance in marrying the good-natured Irish
coachman?
“I beg your pardon, sir,” said she, in very pretty English.
“I was having your things taken upstairs. Would you
please to have luncheon now?"
“Oh yes,” he said, “any time. I am in no hurry."
“I hope you will find everything to your satisfaction
sir- 4"
“Oh, I am sure of that. I am not particular.”
“ If you would be so kind as to tell me anything you

would like different, we could get it. We have had two
letters from Mrs. Chetwynd, sir ; and Mr. M'Gee has been
here several times. I hope you will be comfortable, sir."
“Oh, no doubt, no doubt. You are Mrs.—Mrs. Dunne,
I suppose ?"
“Yes, sir. My husband said this morning he thought
it would rain ; and so I had the fire lit, sir, in case you
might have some things damp."
“Oh, thank you, but I don't think there will be any
need to keep up the fire in this warm weather.”
“ Thank you, sir," said she, and withdrew.
He went to the window. It was a pretty place, despite
the wet. It was so quiet and still that you could not well
tell whether the continuous “sh-sh-sh” outside was the
falling of rain or the murmur of the brooklet that splashed
along unseen, behind the bushes at the foot of the lawn.
The rain, too, had made everything look even more richly
green than it normally is at this time of the year—from the
luxuriant rhododendrons, whose glossy star-like leaves were
all shining wet, to the belt of trees, maple and chestnut and
ash, that made a circle round the place. But through these
trees there were spacious openings; and through some you
looked in one direction over broad meadows and one or
two patches of wood, while in another direction a broad
pale silver streak between the foliage showed where the
shallow waters of a creek came up from Bantry Bay. And
always, in this loneliness, was the murmur of the rain, rising
a little as the wind stirred in the branches, and then again
subsiding into a sort of semi-silence, in which one could
hear the sharp twittering of lurds or the lowing of kine at
some distant farm.
Again there was a knock at the door; and he started.
He.wished this woman's voice had not that peculiar tone in
it. He wished she had the croak of a raven. Was it not
enough that this soft veil of rain was but as a screen that
seemed to hide behind it the fancies and visions and pic-
tures of other days ? That is the saddest thing about rain ;
it makes the landscape look far away; it invites the imagina-
tion; the world looks vague—just as the ghost of a woman's
face may look, if you think of it through tears.

urned to the sing some thinand there was
"Come in,” said he, sharply.
It was Mrs. Dunne; and there was an older woman
visible_bringing some things to a table in the hall. He
turned to the window again.
Presently that pretty, startling voice said
11 Luncheon is served, sir."
“Thank you,” said he, thinking she would go.
She remained, however, standing behind the empty
chair. He went and took his seat.
“I beg your pardon, sir,” she said, “but will you have
champagne or claret ? I have not opened the bottle yet.
Mr. Frank had sometimes the one and sometimes the other.”
At this Fitzgerald flushed like a schoolboy. How could
he explain to her that he was not Mr. Frank; that he was
much more of a fellow-servant with herself? It was clear
that these instructions from Mrs. Chetwynd and from Mr.
M'Gee were putting him into an altogether false position.
“But I am not at all used to such luxury, Mrs. Dunne,"
said he, good-naturedly. “Is there any beer in the house?”
“Oh yes, sir, I will fetch some. And they call me
Kate, sir.”
When she returned with the ale and put it on the table,
he said (without looking up) .
“Thank you, Mrs.—Mrs. Dunne—that is if you don't
mind—if it is the same to you—to have that name, from a
· stranger, you know. And I would not trouble you to wait.
I am sure there is everything here. If I want anything I
will ring."
“Thank you, sir,” said she, with the same pretty polite-
ness; and then she stirred the fire and left the room.
As he sat, moodily and dreamily, at this far too copious
banquet, it seemed to him—or perhaps it was only a bit of
sarcastic phantasy that he played with that women were
by nature really kind and thoughtful and considerate, so
long as you had nothing to do with their affections, when
they were as the tigers that slay. Think of Mrs. Chetwynd's
solicitude about his welfare; her repeated injunctions; the
proofs being visible on the table here at this ordinary mid-
day meal. He, as well as any, and better than most, knew
with what trouble and even difficulty many of these things

spot created home as from hit via for the station as the
must have been procured at a remote country-house in the
south of Ireland. Think of the anxious kindness of this
poor creature who would have him consider himself quite
as much at home as Mr. Frank. Kitty, even when her
heart had gone away from him, when her eyes were smiling
only to deceive him and get rid of him, she must needs
rob herself of half her night's rest for the purposes of
cooking, and come rushing and panting to the station with
the salad that her own hands had dressed. That was the
mission of woman, then? There they found themselves at
home; were natural and trustworthy ? There they were
truest to themselves ? It was an odd theory—but he left
the food before him almost untouched ; and went to the
easy-chair and lit a pipe; but soon dropped that on the
floor and went fast asleep, for he had not closed his eyes
the whole of the previous night.
He was awakened by Kitty's voice (as he thought in his
dreams), and he sprang to his feet with his face white.
“Oh, I beg your pardon, sir," said the English maid-
servant, about to withdraw.
"No, no; what is it, Mrs. Dunne? Do you want to
take away the things ?”
“ It is only Micky the keeper, sir, who would like to
see you, sir. But any time will be convenient-w".
“Where is he?"
“In the kitchen, sir.”
“ Tell him to come along now, and we will go and have
a look at the kennel.”
• Very well, sir.”
Micky, or Mick, as he was generally called, proved to be
a smart-looking, clean-built young fellow of about two-and-
twenty, with reddish-yellow hair, ruddy-brown eyes, and a
face that could express more than his tongue. For he had
come from one of the westernmost districts in Kerry; and
his English was somewhat scant. Fitzgerald, on the other
hand, had almost forgotten what little Irish he ever knew;
so that the conversation that now ensued in the hall, about
cartridges and the cleaning of guns, and what not, was
conducted with a good deal of guessing on both sides.
However, Mick showed himself shrewd enough; he quite

understood Fitzgerald's monitions about the importance of
keeping on good terms with the farmers and shepherds
around; and when, in the little gun-room, they turned over
the various drawers and cases and so forth-sad enough
relics these were of the dead man-it was very clear that
he had done his best to master his trade. The guns had
been beautifully cleaned and carefully oiled and put away.
Such cartridges as were there were well made. Not only
that, but some sea-birds stuck up along the wall were of
Mick's own stuffing ; and they were very fairly done, con-
sidering the difficulty of the performance. Master Willie
had found a companion just to his mind.
“ The loicense, sir ?" said Mick, as if his clear brown
eyes conveyed all the rest of the question.
“Yes, what?"
“'Twas Misther M'Gee was axing would it be a gun-
loicense or a kaper's loicense he was to be getting for me."
“ What had you before ?”.
“Sure I had the kaper's loicense; but Misther M'Gee
was saying mebbe you'd be shooting all the toime yourself,
sir, and what would I be after wanting the game-loicense
for ?"
“What did you use it for before ?"
But this took Mick some time to explain; the fact
being that “his honour," as every one except the English
maid-servant called young Mr. Chetwynd, had been away
frequently during the shooting season, and on that account
the keeper had had a license to kill game, so that an
occasional hamper could be sent to London. Fitzgerald
said he would have to settle that matter afterwards; and
together they set out for the kennel — through the silent
thin wet that seemed to hang in the atmosphere like a
vapour,
He spent about an hour in the kennel and stable; and
then returned to the solitary room, got a book, and sat
down to read in the melancholy silence of the rain. But
he was restless. The type before him got into a fashion of
fading away; and pictures formed themselves in its stead.
This would not do.
He threw down the book; and went out and put on his

through all but rapid.. the salt wateral chances officient occu-
shooting-boots and leggings and waterproof. Then he got
out the fishing-rod he had brought with him; and jointed
it together on the lawn. Then he got his fly-book; and
chose indifferently the first cast that came to hand, which
he twisted round his hat. Thus equipped he set forth
through the shrubbery, and made his way to the side of
the small but rapid stream that came down from the hills
through the valley to the salt water of the bay.
He had not stayed to ask what chances of sport there
were. But the throwing of a fly would be sufficient occu-
pation, he thought; one could not stay indoors the whole
afternoon; besides, there would be practice—in case he
might happen on some better fishing elsewhere.
So he made his way through the rank, tall grass and
herbage (the best shooting-boots in the world could not
keep out the wet) until he reached the side of the stream;
and there he put on the cast; and with a short line threw
the flies on the swirling water. It very soon appeared that
if he only wanted to exercise his skill he would have ample
opportunities; for the streamlet was narrow; long weeds
grew down to the very edge; the water was rapid ; and in
the first three casts he got twice caught up. But when he
had chosen his position better, and was a little more careful,
he soon found himself catching fish, that is to say, small
brown trout of about four to the pound. It amused him,
and did no harm to them; nay, perhaps it was a benefit to)
them, for when they were flung in again they had learned
a lesson in life, and would be more cautious in the future.
And to him there was a certain variety in the occupation
besides merely trying to dodge the tall weeds. To get at
some of the pools and reaches of this sharply curving river
he had to cross necks of land that were obviously covered
at very high tides with the sea water; and as these con-
tained a considerable number of deep, peaty-looking holes
partially concealed by the long grass, there was a possibility
of his finding himself any moment up to the neck in mud.
So he kept on-on this sad, dull day, with the soft rain
continuously falling ; discovering new pools; hanging up on
weeds; landing small fish, and leisurely throwing them back
again, until

Yes, until there was a sound that made his heart jump
—the shrill whirr-r-r-r of the reel! Up went the top of
the rod, out went the butt, in a moment! Then he saw
his opportunity—he floundered down through the bushes,
and got into one of the shallow reaches of the river, where
the water was not up to his knees; here he could deal
with his enemy face to face. The fish had at first banged
away down stream, but was now sulking under a bank; so
he cautiously waded and waded, winding in his line the
while, and keeping as heavy a strain on as he dared. If
this was a grilse or sea-trout making its first experiment
into fresh water, he knew very well that it was as likely as
not to resent this treatment and make a bolt back for the
sea. And now there came between him and his prey a
bend of the river where the banks came close together;
and he was afraid it was too deep for him to wade. The
fearful uncertainty of that moment! Look at the danger
of getting on either bank—scrambling up among the tall
weeds—if the fish should just choose that precious point
of time-
Suddenly there was a slackening of the line, and for a
wild second he saw a blue-and-white thing flashing in the
air and splashing down again on the water. He dipped
his rod. Quickly and sharply raising it, he felt no harm
had been done. But now the line was appreciably slacken-
ing again, and as he rapidly wound it in, he found that the
fish was heading up-stream, and must be approaching him.
This was a serious situation. At last the rod was nearly
vertical, though he was winding as hard as he could to
get the strain on again; and he was anxiously looking at
the point. Just at the instant of his greatest endeavour he
joyfully felt the strain returning—nay, he had to release
his grip of the handle of the reel-he merely kept his fore-
finger on the line, ready for any emergency-and then
with another great whirr-r-r-r away went the fish again,
round a turn in the bank; and the next thing he knew
was that his rod was quite limp and vertical in his hand,
with the line, minus the cast, flying high and idly in the
air.
So far from disheartening him, however, this put a new

aspect on affairs altogether; and he thought that the best
thing he could do, before risking any further and similar
losses, was to go straight away home, and sit down, and
thoroughly overhaul his fly-book, and see that his casting-
lines were in good condition. This, when he had changed
his wet clothes, he proceeded to do; and the table in the
dining-room was pretty well covered with fishing material
when the English maid-servant entered.
“When would you like to have dinner, sir?" said the
young woman.
“I do not care. It appears to me I have dined already,
Mrs. Dunne."
“Mr. Frank used to dine at seven, sir.”
“Very well, seven, if you like. But please don't take
so much trouble as about luncheon; I am used to very
simple fare."
“I am sorry we can't get any game at this time of the
year, sir.”
“Well, I know that."
She lingered and hesitated for a second or two.
“I wish, sir-I beg your pardon, sir—but would you
be so kind as to speak to Micky?”
“What is it now?” said he, looking up for the first time
-for he had been busy with his flies.
“ The Fenians, sir. Some of them have been down
here, and they are frightening the poor boy. He does not
want to join them; but they have been threatening him-
yes, and threatening the house, sir, if he does not join
them "
“Send him to me, Mrs. Dunne. I know the fellows."
Presently Mick appeared at the door of the dining-room,
anxious-eyed.
“ Are there any Fenians about here, Micky?” said he,
pulling at a casting-line. Kate Dunne was listening the
while, though she pretended she was getting out the dinner
things from the sideboard.
“N-no, sir."
“I'm glad of that,” said Fitzgerald. “I come from
the Blackwater; and we know how to deal with them
there. If any of the idle blackguards—I say if any of the

idle bligards," he repeated, looking up, and speaking with
more significance, “ should come bothering about here, and
trying to get decent young fellows into trouble-getting
them to drink whisky and march about at night—you come
and tell me. While I am here I won't have any strangers
come prowling about-do you understand, Micky? Wasn't
it you made up the No. 4 cartridges ?”.
“Sure it was, your honour !”.
"Well, now, it's one or two of the No. 4 cartridges that
I keep in my pocket at this time of the year, just for any-
thing that may turn up; and I generally have a gun handy
especially at night. Now d'ye see now, if I catch any
idle vagabond interfering about the place, and threatening
anybody, or talking about his marching and his counter-
marching ; I'm not going to wait to ask him his business; it's
the Queen's guinea to a quid o tobacco he'll get a charge
of No. 4 shot catching him up behind; and ye weighed
the shot yoursilf, Micky; and sure ye know it'll make the
bligards jump?"
Micky went away deeply impressed. That Irish way
of talking carried conviction with it. He sought out his
friend Murtough the coachman; and, after a second or two
of thoughtful silence, he said,
“Sure 'tis the new master can spake his moind. Blood
and ounds, but I hope there'll be no murther about the
house."
In the evening Fitzgerald dined in solitary state; the
pretty housemaid, very quickly perceiving that he preferred
to be alone, leaving things about handy, so that he could
help himself. Thereafter he smoked and read. Towards
nine or so she again appeared, bringing in the spirit-tray.
“Thank you,” said he, looking up in a bewildered kind
of way (for he had been vaguely dreaming as well as reading),
“I don't want anything more."
“If you would rather have brandy, sir,” said she, “I
think there is some."
“Thank you, but I never take spirits."
“Oh, indeed, sir. I hope you will find your room com-
fortable, sir. You will find a candle on the hall-table.”
“Thank you very much.”

fresh experiences into literature. Nor had he any reflection
that this place, so remote, and still, and silent, and beauti.

secrets to the listening and sorrowing soul. No; he had
got through a sort of day's duty; and that had kept him
from thinking much—which was his chief good at present.
He was glad to be able to do something in return for the
Chetwynds' kindness. No doubt his being there and
occupying the place would reconcile the old lady to the
idea of letting it. He would be able, he hoped, to give a
good report of both house and shooting. And no more
than the man in the moon, it may be added, had he the
slightest conception of the purpose Mrs. Chetwynd had in
view in begging him to be so kind as to go and pay a visit

He was soon to have an inkling of that, however. After
having been some little time in this still, silent, and beau-
tiful place, occupied mostly in taking long and solitary
walks by sea and shore, he wrote as follows to Mary
Chetwynd :-
“ Boat of Garry.
“ DEAR Miss CHETWYND—In the last letter I had from
Hyde Park Gardens, your aunt seemed to think it quite
enough if I remained here enjoying myself in idleness;
and the temptation to do that is sufficiently strong; for it
is one of the most beautiful neighbourhoods I have ever
seen, and the people are very friendly. I think I ought
to remind you, however, that if you wish to let the house
and shooting, it would be easier to do that now than later
on; and really it seems a pity to think of such a place
remaining vacant. I am afraid a good many of the young
birds were killed by the heavy rains in the early spring; but in
some cases there are second broods in the nests; and there
will be plenty of hares. Every one says the winter-shooting
is most excellent; though Mr. Chetwynd does not appear
ever to have spent a winter here. Everything about the
house, as I wrote to your aunt, seems well managed ; the
horses in excellent condition; the dogs not so good, as far
as I can judge (the tenant should bring a brace of thoroughly-
trained setters with him), and the new boiler will be in the
steam-yacht next week. As to the prettiness of the place,

of course you know about that as well as I ; but if I hear
of any photographer coming through by way of Glengariff
to Killarney, I will take the liberty of getting him to come
down here and take one or two photographs. These would
not cost much ; and they would help you in letting the
place. -Yours faithfully, WILLIAM FITZGERALD.”
This was the answer :-
“Hyde Park Gardens, Sunday evening.
“DEAR MR. FITZGERALD--I am in deep disgrace.
Your letter seemed to me so reasonable that I thought I
would venture, in the most roundabout way, to make the
suggestion. Well, auntie, as you know, is not the kind of
person to get into a tempest of indignation ; but I could
see she was really pained at the notion of taking money for
poor. Frank's place; and that she regarded me as a most
unfeeling and wicked creature. Of course I did not press
the matter. I suppose I was premature. But what I
really do believe auntie means to do with Boat of Garry is
to ask you to take it-probably with the name of Chetwynd
as well. Perhaps I should not mention this project to you;
for I have no authority; but auntie has been talking about
it to Dr. Bude (who is a great friend of yours, by the way);
and if he advises yes, the least you can do will be to send
him some game. Auntie appears to wish that in the mean-
time you should wait over for the shooting, unless you find
the place intolerably dull; and we both hope you find the
house and the neighbourhood to your liking; and that if
you are writing any more papers like the 'Woodland Walk,'
you won't forget to put something about Boat of Garry into
them.
“Yours sincerely,
"Mary CHETWYND.
“ P.S. — After all, on reflection, it seems to me that
auntie may be right. I am afraid I should not like to
think of poor Frank's place going away into the hands of
perfect strangers. But as this is a mere piece of sentiment,
I am not going to interfere in any way, or give any advice.

When he read this letter he was seated on a rocky knoll
high up on the hillside, whither it had been brought him
by a boy. Far below he could see the small house en-
sconced among the abundant foliage ; the trim lawn; the
belt of trees; the spacious meadow outside; and the curved
arm of the sea-a silver white-that swept round as if to
enclose the whole. Was it not a beautiful picture, then,
under these skies of June?-a desirable enough posses-
sion ? Here, indeed, was a Vale of Avoca, where one
might pass the peaceful years away, quietly and equally,
with the friends one loved best! But, strangely enough,
he looked on the place with no longing eye. He did not
crave for the shelter, the snugness, the indoor affections
of a house. Here, alone, with the sad hills, and the clouds
floating in from the Atlantic, he was more at rest. He
watched the great and mysterious shadows moving along, and
those hills growing darker and grander, or disappearing
altogether behind the folds of vapour, and slowly revealing
themselves again in altered lines; and in the face of this
mighty phantasmagoria, human life, with all its fears and
ills, seemed a petty and trivial thing. He watched the
great sea darkening or lightening with the lowering or the
lifting of the heavy skies. And sometimes, as it seemed to
him, there was a sudden vision overhead; a break in the
pall of white, and a glimpse into a far and unknown realm
of intensest blue; and then a warmth and a golden glory
spread around him on the herbage and the rocks; and the
clear singing of a lark sprang into the silence, far away
down there over the waterfall and the glen; and the sea
air coming over from the south grew so balmy and soft
that it was delicious to breathe ; one turned one's throat
to it; and the touch of it on the cheek was like the touch
of a velvet glove.
Look, now, at this new companion of his. In the
perfect stillness of sea and sky and land, and while his eyes
are far away, some quick movement near at hand tells him
that he is not alone. A small rabbit, the very tiniest of
baby-rabbits, a ball of brown fur, has come quietly along,
all unconscious of his presence, until it is within three
yards of him. It trots here and there, with a leisurely

ungainly tripping, nibbling the grass now and again, never
looking up. And then, suddenly it stands still; and the
fat little ball of fur has great staring eyes —staring with
observation, not fright; for very likely it has never beheld
a human being before. The big, flat, gray eyes regard him
unwinking ; there is no movement. Then, with a little
forward jerk of the head, up go the long ears; and again
the motionless staring. Then up goes the baby-rabbit itself
on its hind legs; the fore-paws comically drooping ; and
again the steadfast stare at this immovable strange creature
seated on the rock. Then, by some accident, he inad-
vertently stirs a hand or a foot—the eighth of an inch will
do it; and at the very same instant the earth is left empty
—there is only a glimmer of white disappearing into the
brackens a dozen yards away. .
By-and-by he makes out another living object apparently
not much bigger than the baby-rabbit, coming up the hill
by the side of the narrow glen, and as he makes no doubt
that this is the same boy sent up with another message, he
rises, puts the letter in his pocket, and proceeds to descend.
Sure enough, the shock-headed gossoon has a message ;
there is a gentleman waiting for his honour. What gentle-
man? He does not know. Did he come in a dog-cart
with a white horse? That he did. And then Fitzgerald
knows that Mr. M'Gee, the Bantry solicitor, has paid him
another visit ; and hastens down through bracken and over
stone walls until he reaches the road sweeping round to the
house.
This Mr. M'Gee was a big, burly, good-natured kind of
man, with a sort of sporting air about him, who had really
gone a good deal out of his way to make Fitzgerald's stay
at Boat of Garry pleasant for him. And his present mission
was to say (with profuse apologies for delay) that at last the
steam yacht, the Black Swan as they called her, had got
her new boiler in, which was to increase her speed by two
miles an hour, and all she wanted now was to get in a few
tons of coal and a store of oil; and would he, that is,
Fitzgerald, care to take coach and rail to Cork, and make
the trip in her from Cork Harbour to Bantry Bay.
" Oh no; no, thank you," said Fitzgerald, hastily.

. "Sure, 'twould be as safe as sitting in cliapel," said Mr.
M'Gee, with a good-natured laugh. “We'll wait for smooth
wather; and if there's too heavy a swell when we come to
Cape Clear or the Mizen Head, can't we run back and put
into Glandore ?"
“It isn't that,” said Fitzgerald. “I don't feel inclined
to go to Cork just at present.”
“I was thinking 'twould be a bit of variety for ye; for
divil the much there is to do about here at this time of the
year.”
“The fishing is capital.”
“The fishing ! the fishing did ye say?".
“If you like to wait for lunch you'll have a bit of a
three-pound sea-trout I caught in the stream there only
yesterday afternoon.”
“D'ye say that now! It's myself has tried it half-a-
dozen times ! and I might as well have been throwing a fly
into me grandmother's taypot. But faith I'll stay to lunch
wid ye, and give the ould mare a bit of a rest.”
Master Willie did not say anything about the number of
trout to be found in the adjacent stream; but at all events
this particular one proved to be most excellent; and Mr.
M'Gee proceeded to make himself very much at home.
“Katie, darling," said he to Mrs. Dunne when she
brought in the beer, “isn't there a glass of whisky about
the house now ?"
“I beg your pardon for forgetting,” said Fitzgerald,
“but really I am not sure who ought to play the part of
host.”
“Well, many's the evening I've spent in this very room
with the poor boy that's gone; and a pleasanter companion
or a finer gintleman there was not in the country,” said he.
“ Thank ye, my good gyurl ; and isn't there a drop o’hot
wather about now? Well, sir, ye’ve a good ould Irish
name ; and I hope ye'll have a happy stay among us; and
niver fear, ye'll be mighty plazed with the Black Swan
when we get her round, and sure ye'll be able to run up to
Glengariff whenever ye want, and the divil sweep her if she
doesn't do her ten noils an hour."
The quite novel excitement of meeting a stranger had

almost driven the contents of Miss Chetwynd's letter out of
Fitzgerald's head; but when, after luncheon, they went out
to the seat fronting the lawn, and had coffee there on the
little marble-topped table, and lit their pipes, the quiet
charm of the place again stole over him, and he could not
help for a moment wondering what his sensations would be
if he were really the owner of such a delightful spot. Of
course, it was out of the question. A more preposterous
white elephant could not be imagined. Where could he
find money to keep up such a house—to pay wages and
find provender for the horses ? It was like offering a cross-
ing-sweeper the use for the season of a three-hundred-ton
yacht. Indeed he so clearly saw that this could only be
regarded as a sort of pretty sentimental fancy on the part
of Mrs. Chetwynd-as something so obviously outside the
limits of practical possibilities—that he was very nearly
mentioning it to this good-natured lawyer; but as Mr.
M'Gee had for the moment dropped into a snooze, he for-
bore; and finally concluded he would say nothing about
the matter.
The quiet was enough to send any man to sleep. The
day had brightened up; there were wider deeps of blue
between the ribbed-white clouds; and the mellow sunlight
fell warm on the meadows and on the lawn, on the glancing
trembling green of the broad-leaved limes, and on the
still yellower green of the drooping foliage of a swaying
acacia. The air was soft and warm, and yet moist; and it
was pervaded by a scent of all growing things—a general,
vague, delicious perfume that perhaps came chiefly from
the lush grass there not yet cut for hay. A curlew or two
were stalking along the shore, where the bold white scimitar
of the sea came in between the meadows. A blackbird shot
through the rhododendrons, and the silence seemed to miss
its suddenly-closed song. But there was always the plash
and gurgle of the stream at the foot of the lawn; and
sometimes the distant bark of a dog, or the rumbling of a
cart, spoke of a life far remote from this enchanted en-
closure, that seemed to be given over to sunlight and peace
and the growing of green leaves.
The lawyer awoke with a start.

“ Begorra— " said he.
“ You were saying," observed Fitzgerald, just as if he
had not been asleep at all, “ that she was registered up to
eighty pounds on the square inch; but of course the boiler
has been tested beyond that— "
“Faix, I believe I've been asleep,” said Mr. M'Gee,
rubbing his eyes. "'Tis no wonder, when ye get out of
the worrld. What will ye be afther doing now, all the
afternoon ?"
“I? I am going down to the stream to see if I can't
catch another sea-trout for my dinner.”
“Good luck to ye, thin ; and I'll go and get the mare
out, for 'tis a mighty long drive to Bantry.”
So that unusual feature of life at Boat of Garry, a visitor,
disappeared ; and Fitzgerald was left to the solitude and
silence and dreamy loveliness of the place. In the after-
noon, however, he caught a good sea-trout, and also a
brown one of about three-quarters of a pound—a fair size
for this small stream. And again he had dinner by himself;
and thereafter he smoked and read as usual. By-and-by,
when the moon was clear on the gravel walk, he stole
outside ; he had got into a way of doing that; the servants
thought the new master merely wished to have a breath of
fresh air, after the smoke of the dining-room, before going
to bed.
And perhaps it was only that. He walked along the
gravel in the clear light (though the moon was now
waning); and he listened to the croak of the heron and
the cry of the curlew down by the sea. He went along to
the road; climbed over a wire fence; and made his way
up a steep bank where there was a clearance among the
trees. When he got to the top he was on the side of a
deep and almost black chasm—the wooded glen through
which came down the little brooklet that passed by the end
of the lawn. And there he sat down on the stump of a
felled tree; and looked around ; and was alone with the
night and the stars and the moonlit world.
This glen was smaller and narrower than the one near
Inisheen; but it was a far more lovely place; for above
and beyond it towered dark hills-rising far and solemnly

into the clear night sky. There was a more spacious view,
also; of this broad silver creek running out to meet the
wide waters of Bantry Bay; and of wooded islands, and
long promontories; and of the dusky shore beyond, that
seemed to lie behind the moonlight and was half lost in
shadow. Night after night he climbed up to this spot;
and of course it was merely to look at the beautiful picture;
and to listen to the strange, sad, distant sounds in the
stillness. Sometimes a faint perfume of the sea came
borne along by the slight stirring of a breeze ; sometimes,
in a dead calm, before any wind was moving, he thought
he could hear a trembling of the great deep in the darkness,
and a whisper along the shore. Sometimes, moreover, as
he sat there, with the silent hills above, and the great sea
beyond, a wild fancy got into his brain that he could hear
a voice in the sound of the stream—the stream down there
in the dark; it became quite plain—a human voice--so
strange-so strange and clear-Over running water : my
life I give to you. The voice sounded quite close : all
trembling he would bend his head forward-might there
not be two people there ?-or only one voice ?—the voice
of a girl — who was dead, and gone away from the world-
a young girl who used to be associated with all young and
beautiful things, like hawthorn, and blue speedwells, and
sunlit mornings, when there was a freshness in the air?
And then again there would be nothing but the aimless
and meaningless murmur of the stream, down there in the
ravine; and the awful hills and the sombre sea would have
no speech or message for him; and what was the use or
value of this throbbing, fretting, tortured insect-life between
the dark, dead world and the cold and distant and pitiless
skies?

CHAPTER XXVI.
TO THE RESCUE.
here began tories of art of the puoti
ABOUT this time there began to appear in the columns of
a London daily newspaper a series of articles which very
soon attracted the attention and curiosity of the public.
They were a new feature in journalism ; some went the
length of saying that they were a new feature in English
literature. They were called the “ Occupations of a
Recluse," and professed to give some account of the
various pursuits incidental to a quiet country life; but
they were in reality a description of solitary rambles by
roadside and seashore and stream-a succession of care-
fully-studied out-of-door scenes that had a quite unaccount-
able charm about them. For this way of describing nature
was not the poetical way of bringing together similitudes;
saying that one thing is like another thing, and inviting the
imagination to hop the little differences. Nor was it the
other way of giving an honest and trustworthy catalogue-
a gamekeeper sort of catalogue-of the phenomena of the
hedgerow or the wood, leaving the reader who has sufficient
time, training, and patience to fill in the light and colour
and background of the picture for himself. No; there was
something strange in this way of looking at things. There
was a minute observation, it is true, put down in the
simplest of terms; and there was a certain atmospheric
quality that made the picture clear and vivid ; but there
was more than that; there was a kind of sensitive, pathetic
thrill in the writing ; these sights and sounds that were so
quietly and unobtrusively chronicled seemed interpenetrated

322
SHANDON BELLS
by a subtle human sympathy-rather sad, perhaps, in certain
of its undertones. Indeed, to some it seemed that this
writer had got behind the veil; that even the sticks and
stones and flowers had whispered to him in his solitude ;
that the silence of the hills had reached to his heart. And
very soon—as we shall see presently—he began to abandon
even the pretence of writing about definite pursuits. The
farther he was allowed to drift, the farther he drifted ; until
the papers grew to be mainly the reflections of a man who,
whether it was a gun he held in his hand, or whether it was
a fishing-rod, or whether he was merely looking abroad at
mountain and shore and sea, continually found himself face
to face with the mysteries of the world, and with the old
and sad and insoluble problems of human existence.
Of course such a series of papers looked odd-at the
outset at least—in the columns of a London daily news-
paper. The editor of that journal was himself at first very
doubtful; but something in the writing struck him; and,
as his time and attention were then wholly engrossed by a
Cabinet crisis, he shoved the manuscript into his pocket,
and took it home and showed it to his wife, who, when all
his anxieties and interests were confined within the sphere
of politics, acted for him as the mouthpiece of the vain
clamour of the other and outer world. Now this lady
happened to be a person of very keen discrimination in
literary matters; and when she had read the first two of
these papers, her judgment was prompt and decisive.
“This writing is quite extraordinary,” said she. “There
is a description of a frosty night settling down over a stretch
of bog-land, that made me shiver to my finger-tips.”
“It is not news; and it is a newspaper we publish,"
said her husband, doubtfully.
“I should not care whether it was news or not," said
she, “so long as people were interested."
" It is very magazinish," he said.
: “Why should the magazines monopolise literature ?"
she answered.
Well, the experiment was made ; and the public, who
don't care a pin's point about the traditions of newspaper-
offices, seemed to like these quiet and clear pictures of

323
country life, and began to talk about them even amid the
throes of a Cabinet crisis. At first, it is true, they were
more obviously practical. There was a good deal of
information about dogs and guns, about rabbit-snaring and
deep-sea fishing. Even the good Scobell was driven to
send for a file of this journal (which he did not regularly
see, as it did not express his political views) as he took his
seat in the library of his club one evening after dinner;
and so charmed was his imagination with some of these
sketches that he suddenly exclaimed, “Damme if I don't
take a shooting in Ireland this year !” at the same time
bringing down his fist on the table, to the excessive alarm
of three old gentlemen, who had each been fast asleep in
his favourite arm-chair, and who started up to see if the
world had come to an end.
But, as has already been hinted, this new writer by slow
degrees seemed to feel that he was being allowed a good
deal of latitude ; and he took advantage of it to frequently
wander away from the ostensible purpose of these articles,
and to insinuate, rather than to state, a sort of philosophy
of human life which had some odd points about it. He
seemed to say :-“In this strange transit through the
world, from the unknown to the unknown, where should
one most naturally look for safe and close companions whose
intimacy could not be filched away from us or altered by
the fluctuating circumstances of life? Surely in the grand
and beautiful things around us which we know to be per-
manent. The time is so short. Why seek to probe the
unsearchable mysteries of the human heart; to secure and
imprison the elusive; to stake one's happiness on so un-
stable a foundation as human affection? Is there anything
so variable ; so liable to change—nay, to cease? But if
the beautiful things of nature were to become our friends
and loved ones, then securely year after year could we greet
the reappearance of the flowers; and securely day after day
could we welcome the wonder of the dawn; and listen to
the murmuring and soothing voice of the sea. The friend
whom we had trusted might disappoint and betray us;
loving eyes might grow cold and take away their love-secrets
elsewhere; but he who had chosen the winds and the seas

and the colours of the hills for playmates and constant
companions need fear no change. The beautiful human
face would fade; nay, death might step in and rob us of
our treasure; but the tender loveliness of the sunrise re-
mained, and the scent of summer woods, and the ripple of
the rivulet down through the spacious meadows. But then
this companionship had to be wooed before it was won;
the secret voice had to be listened for; the eye trained to
know this wonderful and not evanescent beauty. To such
a lover, secure in his possession, what evil could fortune
bring? Friend and sweetheart might prove false; but
there was no discordant note in the music of the lark; the
suspicions and envies and enmities of mankind might appal,
but there could be nothing to doubt in the clear, beautiful,
blue eye of the speedwell ; and even those who had lingered
in the fight, until sorely stricken there, might find solace
in retiring to these solitudes and seeking out these secret
companions ; letting the seasons go by peacefully, to the
appointed end. “Then are they glad because they be quiet ;
so He bringeth them unto their desired haven.'".
All this was insinuated rather than preached ; and it was
only here and there that some finely-attuned ear caught the
undernote of sadness, and perhaps guessed at its cause.
Of course the bruit of these articles reached the house in
Hyde Park Gardens; and Miss Chetwynd, who was not a
diligent student of newspapers, and had, in fact, missed
them, had to hunt them all out one afternoon and read
them over to her aunt. What surprised her was that mere
sketches of sport, as they seemed, had the effect more than
once of giving her a choking at the throat ; but nothing
was said by way of criticism either by aunt or niece, for the
reading was just finished by dinner-time.
At dinner Miss Chetwynd herself introduced the subject,
and asked if any one knew who had written these papers.
“I don't,” said Dr. Bude, “but what I do know is that
it is a thousand pities that fellow is thrown away on litera-
ture. Literature does not want him ; science does. I can
assure you, my dear Mrs. Chetwynd, that an accurate ob-
server is a very rare bird indeed—far more rare among
men of science than is supposed. There are so few who

325
will take the trouble to look patiently; they must jump to
their theory at once. What does literature want with that
kind of observation ? Literature should deal with the mind
—with emotions. That fellow, now, should be set to work
to observe the habits of beetles or birds, or the action of
the tides, or some useful thing like that.”
“I confess I was disappointed after all the talk," said
Professor Sims, looking over his gold spectacles. “I
glanced at one or two of the papers, and found them in-
consequential. You began with wild-fowl shooting, but got
on to Shakspere and all kinds of things. Then he seemed
to me to be interfering with the proper business of the
artist-describing what ought to be painted. What is the
use of describing the silvery waves that wind makes on a
field of long grass ?_every one can see that for himself.”
“Every one may not be in a position to see it,” said
Miss Chetwynd, in her gentle and yet pointed way. “This
is bringing the picture indoors for you.”
“That is not to be described in words—that is for an
artist to paint,” continued the professor.
“ Could he ?” she said, quietly.
“But there is something to be said,” Dr. Bude interposed
again, “ for his theory that the eye should be trained to
observe the beauty of all manner of simple things, so that
you may increase the value of life. That is practical and
sensible, it seems to me. Even if you don't give science a
lift, you can make a country walk more interesting. He
seems to have picked up some curious illustrations of the
morphology of plants; though I imagine he has no very
minute acquaintance with botany. You have read the
papers, Mrs. Chetwynd ?” added the tall, lank, dark man.
“Mary has just finished reading them to me."
“What is your opinion then ? What is the writer ? A
man of science excusing himself for idleness? A philo-
sopher taken to shooting snipe? Or an artist taken to
literature because his pictures won't sell ?”.
“I am sure I don't know," said the old lady, rather
hesitatingly, and with none of her usual sprightliness. “I
was thinking when Mary was reading them that—that if
my poor boy had taken to writing, most likely that was the

326
SHANDON BELLS
kind of subject he would have chosen to write about. I
liked the papers. They seemed a little sad sometimes—at
least, wistful and strange. There is a kind of remoteness
about them.”
“What is your opinion, then, Miss Mary ?” he asked.
Mary Chetwynd started slightly; she had been listen-
ing with downcast eyes.
"I?” said she, somewhat slowly. “What I think is
that they are written by a man whose heart is broken.”
Indeed she seemed preoccupied during dinner; and
when the people had gone she went quickly back to the
drawing-room, where she had left the cuttings from the
newspaper, and set to work to read them carefully over
again. Her aunt followed her in a short time, and found
her deeply engaged.
“You have no more of the newspaper articles to read,
have you, Mary ?”
“No; I was only glancing over them again.”
By-and-by she looked up; but the old lady could not
see that her niece seemed a little agitated.
“Auntie, surely you must know who has written these
papers ?"
"I, child ?" said Mrs. Chetwynd, absently. “Well, I
was dreaming about them. I think he might have written
them.”
“But, auntie, don't you recognise the place ? It is Boat
of Garry!"
The old lady sighed.
“Yes, that is what he would have written about—no
doubt-the place he was so fond of.”
“But, auntie, these articles are written about Boat of
Garry! Don't you recognise it all the creek, and the glen,
and the islands, and the sea? Why, the acacia on the lawn
is there; and the little marble-topped table; it is like a
photograph. Mr. Fitzgerald has written these articles.”
“Mr. Fitzgerald ? Yes, I should not wonder," said the
aunt, though she was obviously still thinking of the nephew
whom she had lost. “He is very clever. I suppose he
began to write early. I suppose it wants training. But I
think-Frank—could have written them.”

“What I am thinking of is this, auntie," said her niece,
with some touch of feeling in her voice, “that if these
articles are written by Mr. Fitzgerald, we have no right to
ask him to remain in that loneliness. I-I-suppose he
must have met with some sorrow; there it is in every line.
I say we have no right to ask him to remain there. I am
certain he wrote those papers; didn't you see the reference
to the heronry at Glengariff?—and he has put in Bearhaven
as clear as can be. And if—if he is in trouble—no matter
what it is—it is not for women to let him be there all by
himself-eating his heart out in solitude. It isn't human.
I'm sure, I never thought how solitary the place would be
if one were there alone until I read those articles — we
always had plenty of society. It must be dreadful—doesn't
it sound dreadful, auntie ?”
“Oh no, Mary; he seems so pleased with the birds and
the different things around him So you think that is
Mr. Fitzgerald ? Dear me! he has become quite famous,
though no one knows his name."
“They'll know it soon enough."
“And that is his life at Boat of Garry that you have
been reading to me? Yes, it is like the place too_the
gun-room even, and the stuffed birds. You must read them
all over again, Mary. Then it was he who saw the young
rabbit trot along and tell its father and mother? That was
very prettily written; now that I think of it, it must have
been in the wood beside the glen, just over the wire fence;
I wonder I did not notice before how like it was to the
place."
“But you don't seem to understand what I say, auntie;
you are so full of dreams and pictures; and I am in the
main responsible for Mr. Fitzgerald going to Boat of Garry
-and-and-something has got to be put right, auntie.”
“Well, then, child, I don't know what you mean, I
confess it,” the old lady said.
“Mr. Fitzgerald told me something," said Miss Chet-
wynd, with an unaccustomed flush on the clear cut, intelligent
face, “before he left for Boat of Garry; and I guessed more.
Do not tell him so, auntie—don't breathe a word of it—but
I fancy he has been in some trouble; and that solitary place

must have been a dreadful place to be in. I should have
thought of it. It was my fault. But I thought if he were
there for a time you would get accustomed to the notion of
some friend or other occupying the place; and then that
you might let it.”
“I have asked you not to speak about that, Mary. I
can have only a few years to live; and if for that short time
I choose to do what I wish with my own— "
“Auntie dear, don't speak like that to me!" the girl
said, going to the old lady, and putting her hand on her
shoulder. “Surely you know it was not for my own benefit
that I thought of it. It is not money that is likely to come
between you and me, I hope.”
The aunt took the girl's hand and patted it.
“No, no. You are a good child; I wish you were
more saving of your money. Now what is it you want me
to do?”
“One of two things, auntie dear. After reading these
papers, I am quite distressed to think of Mr. Fitzgerald
being there in that loneliness he describes; and I want you
to ask him to come back at once.”
“Child, I want him to have the place ! To whom else
could I give it? Who else could have found out the charm
of the neighbourhood and written like that? No; I have
thought over it, Mary. I could neither sell nor let Boat of
Garry; and I would not have it go to the Lawrences, to
have all those ill-bred young cubs stamping through my
poor Frank's rooms; and what good would it be to you ?
you would marry and give it away to somebody I know
nothing about.”
“If you please, auntie dear, what I have is quite
enough,” said the tall young lady, somewhat frigidly.
“Oh yes, I know; and anything more you might have
you would fling away in Whitechapel,” said the old lady,
with a smile. “Well, then, why should Mr. Fitzgerald
come back? Why should he not become familiar with the
place? Why should he not stay for the shooting?"
The niece remained silent for a minute or so.
“Well, then, there is another thing you must do,” she said.
"I think you and I might go over to Boat of Garry,”

" To Boshortly be leaving
“To Boat of Garry!" said the old lady, rather faintly.
“Very shortly now,” said Miss Chetwynd, cheerfully,
“ everybody will be leaving town; and my poor old auntie
will have nobody to bring her all the wicked gossip. Why
should not we go too ?”
“To Boat of Garry, child ?” said the old lady, almost
reproachfully.
“It is not like you, auntie, to think of refusing to com.
fort a friend in distres:3," said her piece
“But what do I know of his distress and what could
I do, since I am not to breathe a word about it?"
“Well, auntie, I will tell you the truth," said the girl,
frankly. “My conscience is not quite clear. I was mainly
responsible for the arrangement; and I am afraid we have
been rather cruel. I should like to see how things are
going at Boat of Garry; perhaps there will be no need for
us to remain ; we could pay a short visit and then go on to
Killarney. I should feel more at ease. I am afraid Mr.
Fitzgerald has got into a sort of morbid state, through being
all alone there. That may be very good for his literary
prospects, and people may begin and talk about him now,
and make him famous; but I would rather have nothing to
do with the great god Pan and his fashioning of the reed by
the river."
“You are asking a great deal from me, Mary,” said Mrs.
Chetwynd, after a while.
“I think I am asking what is right, auntie."
“It will be all the old sorrow over again,” she said,
absently.
“Oh no, auntie, not that; it will only be beautiful
memories now. I am sure you would like to see Dan and
Wellington again, and Murtough and Kate, and the Ghoul,
and old Father Time, and the children up at Knockgarvan.”
“It is a terrible thing going into an empty house, child."
“Oh, but it won't be empty, auntie !" said her niece,
cheerfully. “We will have the Ballykilloge Barrys over, to
show Mr. Fitzgerald, if he is to have the place, what it can
contain; and we must drive to Kenmare, to see the old
General ; and wouldn't Murtough be glad to take us on to
Killarney?"

“I never thought to see Boat of Garry again,” said the
old lady, wistfully.
"Indeed, auntie, if I were going to be so munificently
generous as to make a present to a friend of a house and
garden and shooting lease, and horses and carriages, and all
the rest of it, I do think I should want to see how he liked
the place, and if he was properly grateful. How do you
know that Mr. Fitzgerald would take it? How do you
know but that he sees nothing in the neighbourhood ?".
“You can judge by these articles," said Mrs. Chetwynd;
but there was a yielding smile on her face.
“You will be able to judge, auntie, when Mr. Fitzgerald
drives with us from Glengariff; and then you will see
whether we have been too cruel in condemning him to such
a solitary banishment. Now that's settled, auntie; and
there is not to be another word."

CHAPTER XXVII.
AT BOAT OF GARRY.
MARY CHETWYND read and re-read the "Occupations of a
Recluse" until every searching and sensitive phrase seemed
to find an echo in her heart; and when at last, one morn-
ing towards the end of July, she found herself standing at
a window in the hotel at Glengariff, looking out on the
beautiful calm bay and the woods and the mountains, it
almost appeared to her as if a dream had become a solid
reality. For the Recluse had written a good deal about
this neighbourhood, though not specifying names; and she
recognised the place now, not as she had known it in
former years, but as transfigured by the new light and
colour he had conferred upon it. It was the dream-picture
become real; here were all the points of it—the rose-hedge,
the little landing-stage, the wide water, the Martello tower,
and the far ranges of the hills. The place had a strange
interest for her. It was something other than the Glengariff
that she used to know.
Her aunt came into the room.
“I wonder whether Mr. Fitzgerald will come with the
carriage," said the niece.
“I have been wondering,” said the old lady, doubtfully,
“whether we should tell him that we know of his having
written these articles.”
"It cannot be long a secret; everybody is certain to
find out."
“It needed the interposition of a Cabinet Minister
before we could make sure," said the aunt, however.

“I was sure from the beginning, auntie. It was only
you who must needs go and get Dr. Bude to beg Mr.
to ask the editor of the Daily Mirror. And all that trouble
for nothing—you ought to be ashamed of yourself, auntie !
Any one could see the papers were written about Boat of
Garry."
“Scold yourself, Mary Chetwynd ; don't scold me," said
the old lady. “There was no trouble about it. You re-
member what Dr. Bude said the moment I asked him ?
—that it was difficult for newspaper editors to get at the
secrets of Cabinet Ministers, but that the reverse of the
process would prove to be easy enough. And a pretty thing
it would have been if we had come all this way on a mission
of charity and compassion, and found that it was not Mr.
Fitzgerald at all who had been writing in the newspapers-
what would you have said then?”.
There was a rumble of a carriage below in the road.
“Oh auntie, come quick," the niece cried. “Here are
Dan and Wellington; and Murtough; and here is Mr.
Fitzgerald, too—but what is he doing on the box?".
The old lady went to the window; and when she caught
sight of the empty carriage, she inadvertently put her hand
on her niece's arm, without saying a word. Then she
turned away—her eyes full.
“Oh, I know," said Mary Chetwynd, cheerfully (though
in her heart she guessed that Fitzgerald had out of delicacy
refrained from presenting himself to the old lady as the
occupant of her nephew's place). “I know. Of course
you must see the scenery so much better from the box. Of
course that is it. Now, auntie dear, are you quite ready ?
Are all your things sent down ?"
“I think so, Mary," said Mrs. Chetwynd, when she had
recovered her composure. “You—you must make apolo-
gies to Mr. Fitzgerald for our interrupting him. We sha'n't
stay song. He may have his own friends coming for the
shooting. We don't want the carriage to take us to
Killarney, if you wish to go back that way. We can hire."
“I don't think you would get Mr. Fitzgerald to agree to
that, auntie,” the younger lady said quietly.
Fitzgerald was in the hall when they went downstairs ;

and he came up and shook hands with them; and said that
their luggage was all in the carriage ; and were they ready?
In this partial dusk, he did not seem changed at all, except
perhaps that his manner was somewhat grave. And he
rather avoided observation, as it were ; he waited until they
went out; and then followed.
But when Mrs. Chetwynd and her niece got into the
carriage, they found that the main part of their luggage had
been placed on the two seats opposite them, leaving no
further room. The Boots of the hotel shut the door.
“Leave that open,” said Miss Chetwynd, almost angrily.
“Murtough, why is all the luggage down here? Mr. Fitz-
gerald, they will make room for you in a moment.”
“Oh, thank you,” said he, going round to the other
side. “I will get on the box.”
“Certainly not,” said she, with promptitude. “You
must have seen everything that is to be seen about here
many a time. Murtough, take these things up beside you.
See, Mr. Fitzgerald, here is your seat cleared. Don't you
think that auntie and I have had enough of each other's
company during such a long journey ?—and we have all the
gossip of the neighbourhood to get from you. I suppose
old Father Time has a dozen more complaints about the
Knockgarvan children ?"
So Fitzgerald had to take his seat inside (the previous
arrangement had been a cunning device of his own), and
away they drove. For a time there was a little embarrass-
ment. He was unaccustomed to new faces; he would
rather have been on the box. Then Mrs. Chetwynd had
got it so clearly in her mind that he was already the actual
owner of Boat of Garry that she kept making little ingenu-
ous excuses for their intrusion. But very soon the light and
pleasant humour of Mary Chetwynd, and the clear frankness
of her eyes, dispersed these awkwardnesses; and Bantry
Bay and all its surroundings began (for him at least) to
assume quite a new and cheerful aspect. Boat of Garry,

and his long hair, and his scythe, was familiarly spoken of

when he raised his head, all smothered in coal-dust, from the
yacht's bunkers, and glared through his huge, brass-rimmed
spectacles? This landau: had no one told him it was properly
called “the Ark ;" especially in wet weather, when its vast
capacity could have transported half the neighbourhood
safely through the rain ? Perhaps he had never heard of
H.M.S. Coalscuttle ? At all events, she said, she was pleased
to see that the Ghoul had not blown him into the air.
“I think it is very wicked of Mary," said the old lady,
"to come and throw ridicule on everything, and make you
think light of the place. Perhaps—perhaps it is from old
association, but I consider Boat of Garry very pretty.”
“Who could say otherwise ?” he answered. “It is a
beautiful neighbourhood.”
“But a bit lonely?" said Mary Chetwynd, timidly.
“Oh no,”
She raised her eyes in astonishment.
“ You don't find it lonely?"
“Not in the least,” said he, simply. “I mean—that is
-well, perhaps it might be called lonely—but I find the
solitariness of it its chief charm, I think.”
She was silent for a second. Then she said good-
naturedly-
“Auntie, what do you think of that as a compliment?
Why, Mr. Fitzgerald, we thought—we imagined—that you
might be rather lonely here—and-and-we thought of
giving you the pleasure of our company for a week or two
-I mean a few days— "
She was clearly embarrassed; but there was a humorous
smile on her face all the time. Then she looked up with
her frank clear look.
"I will confess the truth, Mr. Fitzgerald. My dark and
nefarious scheme has failed. Auntie won't let Boat of
Garry- "
"I don't wish it even talked about,” said the old lady,
but without sharpness.
“And so you see all my plotting and counter-plotting
has only ended in your having been banished away from
humankind for all this time-
“But Boat of Garry is not such a howling wilderness,

re as else what tragic, P he said, lowe Adrigole mace
Miss Chetwynd," he said, with a smile. "Humanity exists
there as elsewhere; and human-folly, shall we say? You
don't know what tragic passions may be smouldering in all
that quiet. Murtough,” he said, lowering his voice some-
what, “has discovered that a man at Adrigole made Kate
an offer of marriage before she married Murtough- "
“I know. She came to me about it. Why did the
stupid girl not tell her husband? What harm was there in
that?”
“Why, none. Only the pitiableness of it,” he said
absently. “It is merely the old story. When you see
three jackdaws flying along together in spring-time, you
know what a story of jealousy, and hatred, and madness
that means; and how one poor chap is doomed to an
inevitable fate. But it appears that the gentleman from
Adrigole, having recently taken to drink, and idleness, and
Fenianism, and so on, is now desirous of renewing his
acquaintance with Kate; so there is to be a tremendous
head-smashing when he and Murtough meet.”
"I will put an end to that,” she said promptly, "for I
know Pat Carey's master.”
“I am afraid Pat Carey hasn't any master to speak of
now," said he. “But Murtough can hold his own.”
For a time there was silence; and only the driving
through the delicious air ; and the opening out of the
beauties of the far-reaching Bay. Mary Chetwynd was
afraid she had said too much about his loneliness. She
could not explain to him, here and now, what she had been
guessing about him from these writings. She had been
listening to inner secrets when she was reading those papers.
Now everything seemed so ordinary and matter-of-fact-
as he pointed out where the coal smack had come to grief;
or asked Mrs. Chetwynd if she had read Professor Sims's
lecture; or got Murtough to stop the carriage so that he
could get out to walk a steep part of the road. And yet,
sometimes, when he was absently looking away over the
wide expanse of water, there was a look in his eyes that
told her something she had only imagined, and that
convinced her that this visit on the part of her aunt and
herself was not so much amiss.

When they swept round the gravel drive and drew up in
front of the house, it was Miss Chetwynd's aim to make a
rare bustle so that her aunt should have no opportunity of
indulging in sad recollections. Sure enough, here was old
Father Time, with his scythe, just finishing off the lawn;
and here was the pretty Kate, all smiling and pleased; and
Mick was sent to bring the dogs; and the Ghoul was to be
summoned to report about the new boiler. But indeed
Mrs. Chetwynd did not seem to mind as much as had been
expected her entering this house. It was far from being an
empty house. Everything was noise and turmoil and con-
fusion. And when at last something like order had been
restored, and when the three sat down to lunch, Mrs.
Chetwynd, so far from being dejected, said, with a smile
on the pretty, bright, old face-
“Why, Mary, this is quite like old times."
The luncheon was not a sumptuous one; but the old
lady was obviously highly pleased—with something or other.
“Your telegram, Mrs. Chetwynd, came late last night,”
Fitzgerald said, “and I had to get away early this morning,
or I should have tried to get you a sea-trout or a brace of
wood pigeons, or something."
“Oh, but this will do capitally,” she said. “If Kate
would only let us have some wine. I hope you found the
wine to your liking, Mr. Fitzgerald ?".
“I–I have no doubt it is excellent,” said he, flushing
somewhat.
“But you don't mean to say you have not tried it-- all
this time ?" said she, staring.
“The beer is very good indeed," said he, evasively.
The old lady looked at her niece, as if to say, “There
is something to be amended here ;" but she said nothing.
Then she began to cross-examine him about his impres-
sions of the place, and his pursuits, and so forth, just as if
she had never heard about the “Occupations of a Recluse.”
Did he like the situation of the house? The shooting
promised to be good this year? And how about the winter
-would it not be a terribly dull place in winter? And she
was very much surprised that he had not made any use of
the Black Swan.

“I don't know much about steam-yachts,” said he, “but
I suppose it costs a good deal in coals before you can get
steam up?"
“A trifle-a mere trifle,” she said. “Surely it was not
that that hindered you?”.
“I thought if you were letting the place it might be
as well to have a full stock of coals in the boat,” said he.
“Never mind, auntie,” said the niece. “You and I and
Mr. Fitzgerald will all have a famous trip to-morrow, if the
day is fine; and we will see what the new boiler can do."
“Not I," said the old lady, with decision. “You two
may go if you like. I wish to end my days in a peaceable
kind of way.”
“Mr. Fitzgerald,” said Miss Chetwynd, “have you ever
steered a small steam-yacht ?"
“I have never been on board one."
“Well, the sensation will be a new one for you—you
must not miss it. You will have the pleasing impression
that a wild beast has run away with you; and that you
haven't the least notion against what it is going to rush.
Then the Ghoul is generally below at his fires; and I
suppose you don't know much about the navigation at
Bantry Bay ?"
“Nothing whatever.”
“This is still more excellent," she continued gravely.
“And when you see the finger of the dial informing you
that you are about twenty pounds above the registered
pressure, you don't know how to let off the steam, I
suppose?”
“ Certainly not."
“Capital-capital. It will be the greatest enjoyment of
your life. The Ghoul will be below; pressure will be 100
lbs. on the square inch; the wild beast will be running
away with you; and you don't know where the rocks are.
And yet they say that Boat of Garry is a sleepy, unexciting
sort of place !”
“If you don't mind, Miss Chetwynd, I would rather
leave the management of that wild war steed to you."
“To me? Oh no. When there is a man on board, of
course the man steers. It isn't a woman's place.”

its not: If not muchever ackno,
“But suppose the man prefers to stay on shore?"
" Then you are afraid ?”.
“ Yes, I am.”
“I thought men never acknowledged that.”
“It does not much matter whether they acknowledge it
or not. If you put a man on a railway-engine, and start
it; and send him careering along the line without any
power to stop; and then if you ask him whether he is quite
happy, and he says, 'Yes,' you can judge for yourself
whether he is a truthful person.”
“Besides," continued the young lady, in the same calm
and placid manner, "you know, you have to get the yacht
out of the creek first; and the deep channel is about a
dozen yards wide ; and it twists between rocks; and the
currents are fearful."
“Mary Chetwynd !” said her aunt, angrily; and then she
turned to Fitzgerald. “I don't know what has got into her
head; but she seems determined to put you out of conceit
with the whole place. The yacht is as safe as sitting in
that easy-chair-why, look at the new boiler! And it is most
delightful to be able to go away on a perfectly still day-
when an ordinary yacht would be unable to move—and go
as far out as you please, and have luncheon there, and come
back just when it suits you. I would go with you myself
to-morrow "
“Only ?” said her niece.
“Only what?"
“I wanted to know what the excuse was to be this time,
auntie dear,” said the imperturbable young lady.
“But I mean to go," said Mrs. Chetwynd, valiantly.
“Now, you know very well, auntie, you are as sensitive
as a cat; and the least speck of dirt on your face or on
your hands makes you fidgety and miserable; and when
H.M.S. Coalscuttle does take it into its head to throw up a
cloud of wet soot at starting-
“But we can go below until she has started!” the aunt
said.
“Who is to steer, then?”

“He knows no more of the rocks than the man in the

moon. Besides, would you miss the expression of the
Ghoul's face when he gets to the Narrows ?"
“Come away, Mr. Fitzgerald,” said the old lady, “and
we will have coffee outside. If you stay here any longer
Mary will persuade you that sea air is poisonous, and that
Boat of Garry is celebrated for smallpox."
Now this fighting, which had been brought about of set
purpose by Mary Chetwynd, had the desired effect of tying
down the attention of the old lady to the affairs of the
moment; and it was wonderful with what little concern-
how easily and naturally—she now took her accustomed
seat on the bench outside the porch and looked around.
The ordeal she had feared was no ordeal at all. She was
regarding the trim-cut lawn, and the masses of rhododen-
drons, and the openings through the trees which revealed
glimpses of the sea and distant hills; and she was thinking
that for a man of letters no more desirable haven of rest
could have been found. Was it a wonder that he had
written those charming papers in this dream - like quiet ?
The world seemed filled with sunlight here; and yet there
was a slight, cool breeze coming over from the sea to
temper the heat; and as it passed along it stirred some
lime-trees down there by the rivulet, and the sweet scent
was all around. And the old lady was very pleased to see
the place looking so beautiful ; and she was pretty sure in
her own mind that a contemplative student would be glad
enough to have it as a gift, and to remain there for a
portion of the year at least, and do the best work of which
he was capable in it, and perhaps also submit to be bothered
—for a week or two in the summer-by a visit from two
idle women escaping into this gracious quiet from the clang
of London life.
Occupied by this pleasing fancy, the old lady, accom-
panied by the two younger people, now set out on an
inspection of the place. Father Time received high praise
for the condition of the garden. Then they visited the
kennel and the stables and the fowl-house and what not;
and, as the day was so beautiful, Mrs. Chetwynd said she
thought she could walk as far as the shore, and have a
look at the Black Swan lying at her moorings.

But to do this they had to return to the house and take
a road leading somewhat inland from the marshy stretches
lying alongside the creek; and they were leisurely walking
along, chatting and watching birds and butterflies and so
forth, when Fitzgerald suddenly discovered that right ahead
of them, at some distance, stood the Knockgarvan bull,
calmly contemplating them, and apparently disposed to
contest their right of way. It was an awkward, even a
serious, situation. He knew the beast and its ill-temper;
and had, indeed, passed it several times, though on these
occasions he had been accompanied—as was his wont in
going about — with one or other of the dogs, and when
there is a dog about the bull does not pay much attention
to its master. However, now there was no help for it;
there was no gate for the two women to go through, no
wall for them to get behind ; and he knew very well that
the first symptom of fear or retreat would be the first
inducement for the bull to pursue. Moreover, he dared
not even tell his companions of their danger; for he was
afraid the old lady might scream and try to run away, and
there was absolutely no shelter. So he continued talking
in a loud and unconcerned way, carefully keeping a short
distance ahead of the two ladies.
“Oh yes, Mrs. Chetwynd," he was saying (with an
anxious eye on the bull all the time), “ that purple loose-
strife is a very handsome plant when you see it growing by
the wayside—very handsome-yes-splendid colour out-
of-doors-
Here he had come within stone's throw of the bull,
which stood immovable but for the angry twisting about of
its tail. He picked up a pebble and carelessly shied it at
the animal.
“Get out of that !” he growled—with apparent indiffer-
ence—and forthwith continued his talking.
"—but it is worth nothing in-doors. It does not tell
in a room. It loses the pink and becomes purple. I told
Mick to cut a lot, and meant to put them in the dining-
roon when you came; but I found they would not
do "
Here the animal gave a low, warning bellow; but there

was nothing for it. He kept on talking; always a little
ahead of his companions; and he knew the time was, come,
for good or ill.
"Mr. Fitzgerald," said Mrs. Chetwynd, anxiously,
“hadn't we better go back ? "
“Oh no," said he, carelessly. “Come along. It is
only one of the Knockgarvan beasts strayed down from the
farm. Get out of the way, will you ?”.
He lifted this time a big stone—what in those districts
is called a rock-and pitched it at the brute, intending to
miss him. By dire mischance the lump of stone landed
on the animal's nose ; and Master Willie's heart at the
same moment leapt to his mouth, for he was convinced
that the beast would not endure such an insult. But
slowly and sulkily, and with deep mutterings and twisting
of the tail, the coward brute yielded its dignity, and crossed
a ditch and went into the adjoining pasture. Fitzgerald
was much too prudent to try a repetition of the stone-
heaving. He let well alone.
“I was saying,” he continued, as if nothing had
happened, “that loosestrife isn't good for lighting up a
room. Foxgloves are better ; but even they are too purple.
Now a splendid show of wildflowers is to get the marigolds
that grow in the corn here; and mix them up with meadow-
sweet- "
He cautiously turned his head; the bull—at some
distance was regarding them, but evidently not inclined
to follow. In a few more minutes they were down at the
little landing-slip; and here was the Ghoul, otherwise
Sheil Glanny—a great, awkward-looking man, with bushy
black hair and brass-rimmed spectacles —seated on the
beach, tarring a broken-down old punt.
“Sheil,” said Fitzgerald to him, under his breath, “haul
in the boat there; and I'll row the ladies out to the yacht.
And then you'll go back to the house, and tell Mick to
bring a couple of the dogs along the road, and drive the
Knockgarvan bull up to the farm. And you'll tell him to
tell the boy that the next time he lets the beast go wander-
ing down here like that, I'll come up with a stick and beat
him till he's black and blue.”


## p. 342 (#354) ############################################

342
SHANDON BELLS
“Sure I'll do it mesilf now, sir," said Sheil, looking
about for an instrument.
Then it occurred to Fitzgerald that this was a most
injudicious threat, seeing how near the shooting season
was.
"No," said he; “Mick is to give the boy this shilling,
and say I am much obliged to him for keeping his dog
from hunting; and while the ladies are here, would he
see that the bull is kept up at the farm ?"
“Very well, sir,” said Sheil, going away rather down-
faced, and no doubt thinking that it was throwing away a
shilling when a beating would have done as well or better.
So Fitzgerald got into the big boat and rowed the two
ladies (he noticed that Mrs. Chetwynd kept a hand tightly
grasping the gunwale all the time, though the water was
like glass) out to the Black Swan and got them on board.
She was a smart enough looking yacht of about fifty feet
in length, with a small cabin aft, and a larger one forward ;
and as there was a pretty strong odour of new paint about,
it was clear that Sheil Glanny had been occupying his spare
time usefully. Indeed so anxious did the old lady seem
that Fitzgerald should express approval of the little yacht
that even her niece refrained from making disrespectful
comments; nay, she even undertook to make a cup of tea
for them, until she found that all the small lockers were
locked and that there was neither tea nor anything else to
be got at on board.
"I think she is a beautiful little boat; and very handy
and convenient,” said Fitzgerald, to the old lady's great
delight. “I had no idea there was such room in her.
Why, half-a-dozen people could sleep on board. And with
that twisting channel down at the mouth of the creek, a
sailing-yacht would never be able to get in here. To-
morrow, then, Mrs. Chetwynd, would you like to take a
trip; for I will tell Sheil about getting up steam ?”
“If-if you wish it,” said Mrs. Chetwynd, rather
doubtfully.
“Don't drive auntie into a corner,” said the niece,
laughing. “She would be trembling all the time. No;
she shall come down to the beach; and I will go with you,

if you like, for I know the way down the creek; and we
will have a short run out and back, and pick up auntie
again. How will that do ?”
“It will do very well,” said the old lady, “ if you are
not in one of your scornful moods. But when Mr. Fitz-
gerald knows you a little better, he will know when you
are speaking the truth and when you are not.”
When they got back to the house again (there was no
bull to contest their passage this time) Fitzgerald took out
his fishing-rod, and said he was going down to the stream to
see if he could get a sea-trout for their dinner; while the
two ladies had tea brought them to the little table outside
the porch.
“Mary,” said Mrs. Chetwynd, after a time—what a
beautiful, quiet, golden afternoon it was !—“I wish you
would write to Mr. M'Gee, and ask him to come over and
see me. Or we can send up the yacht for him, if that will
suit him best."
“Very well, auntie," said the younger lady, dutifully;
“but I think you are making a mistake.”
“Why?"
“I have seen it brewing all day long. The place looks
pretty; Mr. Fitzgerald is pleased with it, and you are
proud of it; and you have gone back to your old notion
of giving it to him."
“Well ?"
“What would he do with it? He has no money to
keep it up, as poor Frank had. You couldn't expect him
to live here all his life, in any case—a young man like that,
with a great career before him. Why, you'd never even
have the satisfaction of seeing him to let him say 'Thank
you' for your kindness. Besides, I wouldn't trust the con-
veyancing of a valuable property to Mr. M'Gee.”
“Really, Mary,” said her aunt, with a little laugh, "you
must have been thinking about it as much as I have all
day. But some of your objections meet each other. I
don't want Mr. M'Gee to convey the property ; but to
come over and make a calculation as to what would be
necessary to keep it up, as it stands. When I present a
picture I like to present it framed. And then, no doubt,

if what people say about these writings is true, no doubt
Mr. Fitzgerald would have to live a part of the year in
London ; and I am sure you would be as glad to see him
as I should be—for the more I see of him I like him the
better; and—and—in a measure I should like him to be
to us what—what my poor boy was. Well, that means
money. That means an allowance, Mary. Do you think
he is not deserving of it?” ,
“I wouldn't say that, auntie dear. But all the desery-
ing people don't meet with such a kind friend. I suppose
he will continue to write? You know, auntie—now don't
be cross, for I am only talking common sense-I think
you were too good to poor Frank; and many a time I
wished he would give up his hunting and come and do
some kind of useful thing— "
“Now, Mary, that is enough,” said the aunt—but with-
out anger. “We are not all reformers and politicians like
you. If my poor boy pleased himself, that is enough for
me; that is what I like to think of. But there's always
good sense in what you say, Mary. Of course, I should
not dream of making Mr. Fitzgerald such an allowance as
would make him independent and careless. Oh no. But
I think I can trust the lad. I like the look of his eyes.
And if he cannot be everything that my boy was to me-
well, at my time of life one is glad to be able to do what
kindness one can; and I don't see any one else to whom
I would rather give Boat of Garry."
The niece was silent for a little while.
“Auntie," said she at length, "if you are quite resolved
upon this, will you allow me to tell him to-morrow ?”
“Yes; why not ?"
“There are one or two things I should like to say to
him—if you don't mind.”
“Why not? Who knows all the circumstances of the
case better than you? Well, now, Mary, I am going to
my room to lie down for a while; but you may come and
knock at my door before dinner.”
Master Willie was not fortunate that afternoon, for there
was not a breath of wind, and the surface of the pools was
like glass; and he was returning to the house rather dis.

heartened—not knowing that the Ghoul had got two
splendid flounders, a cod, and a skate in his drift net, and
that Mick, who had been sent up the hill, was bringing
back a brace of mountain hares and a couple of teal—when
he met Miss Chetwynd. She was trying to plait rushes;
and not succeeding very well.
“Mr. Fitzgerald,” said she, looking up with those clear,
blue-gray eyes of hers, “was not that rather an ill-tempered
bull we met this afternoon?”
“It does not like strangers.”
“And we were in some danger ?”
“Well,” said he, hesitatingly, “something might have
happened.”
“I thought so," she said, regarding him. “And yet
you would not tell us we were in danger.”
“What would have been the use ? I should only have
frightened your aunt and made more mischief."
“If my aunt had not been there, would you have told
me?”—and for a second her frank, shrewd, enquiring eyes
met his.
“Yes, I think I would have told you," he said.

SHANDON BELLS
CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE BLACK SWAN.
MARY CHETWYND's manner was ordinarily marked by a
perfect ease and simplicity ; it seemed to suit the sincerity
of her eyes; women noticed it and found her companion-
able; sick children were glad to be nursed by her; poor
people did not become self-conscious when she entered their
door; at her aunt's table she spoke to guests and servants
in precisely the same voice; she had the same smile, the
same frank look for every one. All this pertness of humour
she had displayed since their arrival at Boat of Garry had
been assumed; but it had answered its purpose; the old
lady had taken quite naturally to the place; there were no
fits of despondency or gloomy reminiscences. But when
she herself drew near the true object of their visit, she
became more grave; and again and again found herself
wishing that these explanations were well over. At all
events, chance provided her with an ample opportunity of
making them.
Next morning Mrs. Chetwynd had almost resolved to go
on board the Black Swan, and even went down to the
shore of the creek with them; but at the last moment she
changed her mind, and said she would go to the hill above
the house, from which she could see them sail away out
into Bantry Bay and back. But this hesitation had
caused delay; and when at length Miss Chetwynd and
Fitzgerald and Mick the keeper got on board the little
yacht they found the Ghoul in a state of great excitement
and impatience. There was a rapid ebb tide running ;

THE BLACK SWAN
347
steam was up to within five pounds of the extreme registered
pressure; the donkey-engine was rattling away as if it were
in a tin box; and Sheil Glanny was here, there, and every-
where at the moorings, at the furnace-door, at the waste-
pipe, at the coals. And then, before Fitzgerald fairly knew
where he was amid all the uproar, he found himself with
a rope in his hand, and the rope was attached to a hauling
and jerking and throbbing iron tiller, and he knew that the
Black Swan was forging ahead just anywhere, for the con-
densers had not arrived, and he was enveloped in steam,
not even the bow of the boat being visible.
“Miss Chetwynd," he called aloud–for the Ghoul was
down in the bunkers again—"have you any notion where
we are going?"
“Not the least," said she. “But Micky is at the
bow.”
However, the steam abated, or else the wind freshened;
at all events, he began to get glimpses of his surroundings,
and strove as near as he could to keep this raging little
beast in mid-channel. And what a noise it made !-or
rather a succession of noises, each distinct, and each sharply
following the other! And then there was still another-a
sudden, brain-dividing shriek, twice repeated ; and he saw
that Miss Chetwynd had hold of the brass chain of the
steam-whistle.
“That is a signal to auntie: do you think she will
hear?”, she said—or shouted.
“Hear?” he answered. “They will hear it at New
York. I believe you have killed every curlew within six
miles of us."
Then, to his unspeakable satisfaction, the great black-
headed creature with the big brass-rimmed spectacles came
on deck again, and assumed charge of the tiller, calling
Mick along to help at the same moment. It was evident
they were approaching the dreaded Narrows. Now and
again in the deep clear water some sudden flashes of
golden-brown were seen—the long arms of the seaweed.
Far ahead there were some strange-looking swirls-silver
curlings on the glassy blue; though no rocks were visible.
Moreover, as they drew nearer and nearer to this narrow

SHANDON BELLS
swinged over lent, a hand
channel it was very apparent that the tide was flowing
seaward like a mill-race.
“We should have started an hour before," said Miss
Chetwynd, looking rather apprehensively at the swirling water.
“At all events we can't turn and face that tide now,”
her companion observed.
The Ghoul was paying heed not to them, but to the
course of the water and the lie of the shore. Then he
shouted-
“Hard over, Mick !”
Fitzgerald lent a hand, too; and the iron tiller was
jammed over. Of course he looked to see the yacht
swing round. She did nothing of the kind. The current
was too much for her steering way.
There was a slight scratch-a sort of grating sensation
-only for the briefest possible point of time. Fitzgerald
looked at Miss Chetwynd—with a natural sort of enquiry;
for she knew more about this performance than he did.
He found she was regarding him—and waiting.
They had not long to wait. In fact the whole thing had
happened before they had had time to think. Immediately
following that grating scratch along the keel there was a
distinct and solid bump that shook the yacht from stem to
stern; the Ghoul sprang forward to shut off the steam;
there was the slightest tilting over of the boat; and then,
after all this excitement and noise, the strangest imaginable
silence. Everybody stood still, doing nothing. The Ghoul
looked away astern, in a reproachful kind of way. Then
Fitzgerald began to wonder whether she was aground on
rock, or on shingle, or on mud; and whether she would
remain upright. And then various examinations and sur-
mises and suggestions resolved themselves to this—that
they were stuck here for five hours at least, with the com-
pensation that the summer day was beautiful and around
them a perfect and delicious quiet.
“You know, Miss Chetwynd,” Fitzgerald said, at length,
“Mieky and I might manage to get you ashore in the boat.
We should be whirled along a good bit; but that would
only give you another quarter of a mile to walk back to the
house."

“ Would you have me desert the ship?" she said.
“What might become of Sheil, if he were left alone?
You could never pull the boat back to the yacht against
that current. Besides, when the tide rises high enough to
float the yacht again, who knows what will happen ?”.
“But five hours- ” said he.
“Mr. Fitzgerald,” said she, somewhat diffidently, “I—
I have some things to tell you that—that won't take up
five hours perhaps ; but that will give you plenty to think
over for that time."
“Not too serious ?” he said.
“Oh no, not at all. I hope not,” she said.
So they had to set to work to make themselves comfort-
able during this enforced detention. Fortunately, the
Black Swan, when she ran into the bed of shingle and
seaweed, fixed herself without much of a list; and the
deck stools were quite serviceable. Sheil Glanny had
gone below to bank up his fires and let off some of the
steam; and Mick had accompanied him. These two, then,
were practically alone in this shining, silent world of
sky and sea, with the slow-sailing white clouds mirrored
in the blue expanse of water, and the slight hissing
all around them of the currents swirling between the
rocks.
Mary Chetwynd's manner, as has already been said, was
in ordinary circumstances marked by a perfect ease and
self-possession; she never seemed to have to think twice
about what she was going to say; she always appeared to
be on the most simple and friendly terms both with herself
and with everybody around her. Now, however, it was
clear that she was embarrassed. She remained silent for
a time; her eyes were fixed on the deck; once or twice
she opened and shut her sun-shade aimlessly. And when
she did speak, she jumbled nearly all the things she had to
say together, in a very incoherent way.
“Mr. Fitzgerald-1-I don't think you and I have been
quite fair to each other. I-I have been reading those
papers in the Daily Mirror-I did not know you thought
about such things -- and then I am afraid you have not
been quite happy here—and auntie wants to give you the

SHANDON BELLS
place—and hopes you will stay here—and I want you to
go away.”
Her fingers were trembling.
“It is so difficult to make explanations," she said. “But
I feel that it was inconsiderate of me to ask you to come
here "
What could make her so timid and almost distressed ?
—she who ordinarily did not seem to know what nervous-
ness meant.
“I hope you won't think of it,” he said, hastily coming
to her rescue-and with an embarrassment about equal to
her own. “Yesterday you seemed concerned about it also.
Please don't think of it for a moment. I assure you it is
a very good thing for people to be alone sometimes; it
makes them find out something about themselves. Surely
it is not a trumpery matter like that that you want to speak
about for five hours, Miss Chetwynd ? I assure you I have
enjoyed the time tremendously since I was here—I don't
expect ever to have such a holiday again as long as I live.
But who told you I wrote those papers in the Mirror ?"
“Who told me?" she said, with her face brightening;
for now the awkwardness of beginning was over; and here
was a solid, practical subject that involved no danger.
“ They did. Every line—though I don't think you ever
wrote quite in that way before. Auntie herself would have
led me to suspect; for she thought they were like what
our poor Frank might have written, just as she thought
about the other papers in the Household Magazine. So
there must be some similarity ; but yet I see a great
difference—_"
Here she flushed slightly; and immediately said
“I wonder, now, if you know here what an impression
they have made on the public? I suppose not. Do you
know that every one is talking about them—as something
quite new in literature? And the weekly papers have been
saying the nicest things about them, especially the Liberal
Review "
"No-not the Liberal Review ?" said he, quickly.
“Oh yes, indeed. Again and again. When you go
back to London you will find yourself quite famous.”

THE BLACK SWAN

That topic ought not to have been distasteful to a young
author; but he merely said-
“I have had some letters about them. And invitations
to contribute elsewhere. One publisher, indeed, wants to
reprint them. If that were done, and if the public cared
to read them in that form, I might be able, after all, to gain
some little footing in literature-enough for a beginner. I
had begun to despair. I was at it a long time; and of
course one does not like to confess oneself a failure ;
and I should like to have a definite way of earning a living
besides. But don't bother about my affairs, Miss Chet-
wynd."
“I must,” she said, brightly—for she was glad the ice
was broken. “I have been entrusted by auntie with the
duty of telling you that she is more bent than ever on ask-
ing you to take over Boat of Garry- "
“I remember. It is very kind of her, I am sure," he
said, “but in my circumstances it would be worse than
useless.”
“Yes; so she understands," said his companion, calmly.
“You mean that you could not afford to keep up the place.
Every one must see that. But what auntie says is that
when she presents a picture to any one she presents it
framed ; and, of course, she would see that you had enough
to keep up Boat of Garry properly. More than that—and
this is where my interest comes in—you would have quite
enough to have rooms in London besides, and you might
spend as much of the year there as you wished; in fact,
you would have your entire time at your disposal."
He was regarding her with astonishment, almost with
incredulity.
“I do believe," she said, with a slight, humorous smile,
“that you think I am going to ask you for a subscription
to my charities.”
“No," said he, “I was wondering why your aunt should
be so kind to me. This is overwhelming "
“Oh, do you wish to know why poor old auntie is kind ?
You had better leave that to the philosophers. It is a way
she has. And in this instance I don't oppose her. I hope
auntie will live many years yet; and I don't see the fun of

keeping up Boat of Garry for the benefit of Mr. M'Gee.
Now, Mr. Fitzgerald, as auntie doesn't talk any longer of
asking you to give up your name as a condition, I have no
doubt you will become the owner of Boat of Garry, and
you will be your own master, and have all your time at
your disposal. Very likely auntie may expect you to spend
most of the year here. I hope you will not. You will be
in a position to be of very great use in the world. Of what
use would you be here? It would be all very well to use
Boat of Garry as a place of recuperation-after work done;
but it would be selfish--at least, so it seems to me-if you
were merely to settle down here to enjoy yourself, even in
the most innocent way, with those delightful rambles that
you describe. Mr. Fitzgerald,” she said, after a second, “I
don't think you have been fair to me. You have met me
among some scientific people; and you think I care for
nothing but science. You think I am heartless. Well, let
that be as it may; it is of no consequence; but at all events
I think this—that those who are well off, and in a position
where they enjoy the comforts of life in peace and security,
should remember how these things were made possible to
them—simply through the best people, century after cen-
tury, doing their best—and they ought to have some grati-
tude, and be willing to lend a hand at the same work, for
the benefit of those who are in less favoured circumstances.
I don't like to talk about what some of us are trying to do
among the poor in the East-end of London; for it isn't
very picturesque; and it does not appeal much to senti-
ment; and then it is so easy to impute motives. Well, I
don't care much what the motive is, if the result is the same.
Very likely, doing charitable actions is only another form
of self-gratification; and I suppose I consider myself a
superior person ; but let us take the case of a sick woman
who can't stir from her bed to look after the poor room and
kitchen, and she is afraid her husband, when he comes
home at seven, will be discontented, and go away to the
public-house, and suppose you take one of your district
nurses to the place and say to her, 'Well, never mind about
the physic; she can help herself to that if the bottle is
marked; but you look round in the evening, between six

and seven, and give the place a bit smartening up, and have
hot water for the husband's tea, against his coming home,
and stir the fire, and have one or two illustrated papers
about '-well, perhaps, to see the look of gratitude on the
sick woman's face is only to flatter your self-love; I don't
say it is not; but ask the poor woman what is her opinion
-whether she would have that done for her, or have the
house left to its discomfort and squalor, and her husband
turn out and leave her alone.”
“I don't think,” said he, slowly, “that I should be quick
to impute motives, if you would tell me what it is you are
doing there."
“Oh, but when I find a sympathetic listener,” she said,
with a laugh, “I am dreadful. I know so many stories
that are interesting to me, because I know the people;
but they cannot be so interesting to others—
“You see, Miss Chetwynd,” he continued, “short of a
miraculous rising of the tide, we are stuck fast here for four
hours and a half— "
"And you would have four hours and a half description
of our lectures and entertainments, our Sunday services,
and district nurses, and open-air spaces, and our window
flower-boxes, and all that? Oh no. Some other day,
perhaps. At this moment, Mr. Fitzgerald, it has occurred
to me that you might ask whether there is anything that
might serve for lunch on board this shipwrecked boat."
“I believe there is a tin of biscuits," said he.
6. That will do excellently."
“Shall I bring them now?".
"If you please.”
Accordingly he went down into the little cabin, and
handed up, not only the biscuits, but also two bottles of
soda-water and two clean tumblers; so that they had a most
wholesome, if somewhat simple, banquet on deck, on this
fair warm summer day. And insensibly she began to tell
him something of her own troubles; for it appeared that
those charitable people were not all of one mind; and,
besides certain schemes and organisations of her own plan-
ning, it turned out that she belonged to one or two societies
of kindred intent.

“And I do so want somebody to back me up,” she said.
“ You must know I am a dreadful heretic and innovator,
Mr. Fitzgerald—I am the champion of beer.”
“Oh indeed,” said he.
“You know, it is easy enough to get on with the boys'
entertainments; all they want as a bribe is a biscuit or two,
with some apples, or nuts if it is not apple time. And then
we are doing good service to the country by reading them
patriotic poetry or stories of bravery at sea; and showing
them a bit of practical science by means of a magic lantern;
or even hinting that a boy should be too proud to steal,
and not refrain simply from fear of the police-station. But
the men : what I say is, how can you expect the Stepney
workman, or the costermonger from Shadwell, or the tired
labourer from the docks to come and sit out a lecture on
ventilation or some such thing, with nothing to make
him comfortable but a cup of tea, which gets cold directly,
and with his pipe in his pocket ? I say it is asking too
much. I say it is not common sense. What harm is there
in letting each man have his pint of light ale-I am afraid
they would not take to the Bavarian beer, though that
would be the safest—and his pipe? I did not like it at
first; but now I can stand a hall-full of men smoking pipes.
One must not be too particular. I was amused not long
ago at the bravery of Lady - who came down to see
how we were getting along. She came to a boys' entertain-
ment, in a very low neighbourhood—to tell you the truth,
Mr. Fitzgerald, I suspect about one-third of them were
thieves; but all the same she stood at the door as they
went out and shook hands with each of them and compli-
mented them on their good behaviour. And the next night
I had got them together, I thought I would tell them that
Lady --- was a great friend of the Queen's; and one
small chap said immediately, 'Please, Miss, did the lady
ever shake hands with the Queen ?' You can see what the
poor little fellow meant, that he had shaken hands with some
one who had shaken hands with the Queen. But there
again, that shows the imprudence of allowing strangers to
come among us out of mere curiosity, for they would call
that snobbishness "

THE BLACK SWAN

“What does it matter what they call it ?" said Fitzgerald,
with some warmth.
“I thought it was very pretty of Lady to shake
hands with each of the boys; and I take no shame to
myself that I told them she was a friend of the Queen's.
It is very easy to criticise when you don't have to face the
actual circumstances. I know it took me some time before
I could bear the tobacco-smoke. I tried a mean way of
getting out of it by presenting them with good tobacco;
but that was no use; they would not smoke mine; I
suppose it was too delicate. Oh, did you hear what Mr.
Scobell did just before we left London ?”
“No, I think not.”
“He sent me another three hundred filters 1-just think
of it. So there will have to be another big lecture and a
distribution as soon as we get back.”
Apparently this young lady with the clear eyes and the
bright smile had found a sufficiently sympathetic listener,
for the time passed quite unobserved as she described all
this work that was going on. They did not even notice
that the tide was now flowing in; that one or two shallow
banks, where the heavy sea-tangle had lain exposed in the
sun, were now covered by the sea again; and that the
Ghoul was watchful and anxious.
All at once the Black Swan was found to be moving ;
but it was only a list from one side to the other; that was
so sharp, however, that it very nearly threw everybody into
the water. And then as the tide rose she gradually righted ;
Sheil Glanny, finding she was deep enough astern, ventured
upon backing her off; there was just enough room to turn;
and the next minute the Black Swan was sailing right up
the creek again, while a shrill scream or two from the steam-
whistle would tell the Boat of Garry people of her return.
And then the throbbing and puffing and churning came to
a sudden end; in renewed quiet the little yacht cut its way
through the glassy water; with the boat-hook Mick dexter.
ously made a grab at the moorings; and presently the two
voyagers were on their way to the shore.
“There now, Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, as they walked
along the road together to the house, “have I been the

whole day talking to you about heaps of things that you
cannot take any interest in ; and all that I meant to say to
you I have forgotten. Except this— please don't stay at
Boat of Garry when it becomes yours—at least not always.
I am very, very sorry I asked you to come here I would
not have done so if I had thought you were going to write
about it like that-I am very, very sorry-
She was speaking in rather a low voice, with her eyes
downcast.
“But why?" said he, good-naturedly. “Any place is
solitary when one is alone; and this place is most beautiful
—that is all the difference. But do you really think,” he
added, more thoughtfully, “ that these papers have made an
impression on the public?"
“Most certainly,” said she, with her face brightening.
“Who could doubt it? Or is there any wonder that people
should be grateful for having it pointed out that the common
things of the world are far more beautiful than they had
fancied ? Does it not make life a little richer ?"
“But I had nothing to do with that,” said he, absently.
“I was only repeating John Ross—my artist friend, you
remember, Miss Chetwynd: I was only pointing out what
he had shown me. No, why I asked was with the fancy
that perhaps now I could earn something in literature.
Perhaps there might be a prospect for me now; indeed, I
think so myself, from one or two offers that I have received.
Pray forgive me, Miss Chetwynd," he added, suddenly
recollecting himself, "for talking about my affairs to you;
but indeed I might say that you yourself are concerned— ”
"I?" she said, with something like a start.
“In a measure," he continued. “I should like to go
back to London soon, I think "
“Oh, I am glad of that !” she exclaimed, with very
obvious eagerness.
“And if matters go well,” he said, "you know you hinted
about a contribution to all these varied charities of yours-
I say, if matters go well, you will perhaps allow me to give
you a contribution.”
She laughed lightly. She did not think it was probable
he was sc soon to become rich.

“What will your contribution be?" she said, idly, as he
opened the big iron gate for her.
“Well,” said he, “if your aunt would consent-
“My aunt. What has she to do with it?".
“Oh, a great deal,” he continued, as they walked along
the gravel path up to the house. “I was thinking, if she
had no great objection, my contribution ought to be
“Not two hundred pounds a year ?" she suggested,
rather jokingly.
“No," he answered, looking round at the beautiful place.
“I was thinking that my contribution ought to be-Boat of
Garry."

“Now, auntie dear," said Mary Chetwynd, as she put her
hat on the hall-table, and smoothed her hair, and went into
the room, “I know you are going to scold me."
“Indeed I am," said the old lady, with some astonish-
ment and indignation. “Where have you been ? To
Limerick ? To Queenstown ? Scold you, indeed 1-no
wonder! "
“Oh, but I don't mean about that," her niece said.
“ That was unavoidable. We have been close by all the
time—stuck fast. I daresay you were afraid of the bull
and came straight home; but if you had only climbed up
the hill high enough, you might have had the pleasure of
contemplating us for the last five hours. Only another little
adventure : one gets used to them on board the Black
Swan."
“How provoking now!” Mrs. Chetwynd exclaimed.
“ The very first time that Mr. Fitzgerald goes to try the
yacht! Of course he will think she is always getting into
trouble. "
“Isn't she, auntie dear ?"
“What was Sheil Glanny about?" said the old lady,
angrily.
“Now, auntie, you need not quarrel with Sheil Glanny.
The real cause of the accident was yourself. You kept pre-
tending you wished to go, just to assure Mr. Fitzgerald that
nothing could be more delightful than a trip in the Coal-
scuttle ; and so we were late in starting; and at the Narrows
could be in to 80, just was yourseleith Sheil Gla

the current came after Sheil Glanny as if it wanted to
swallow him; and then we found ourselves quietly shelved.
Now, auntie, tell me; as I have been talking to Mr. Fitz-
gerald for these five mortal hours, haven't I done my best
to make up for the silence he must have endured here?
And what will he think about women's tongues after that ?"
“I have not the least doubt," said the old lady, peevishly,
" that you were all the time trying to make him discontented
with Boat of Garry."
“No, not quite so bad as that,” said the young lady.
She was seated with her back to the window, and the after-
noon sun touched the outline of the prettily-shaped head,
leaving the face in shadow. “But still bad enough to
merit a scolding. I am quite prepared for it. For indeed,
auntie, Mr. Fitzgerald seemed quite surprised when I told
him what a stir these writings of his had made; and naturally
he wishes to get back to London, which is the proper place
for a literary man; and no doubt he is ambitious "
“Yes, and no doubt," said her aunt, “you encouraged
him in thinking of leaving Boat of Garry, the very place
where he found just such things as he could write about,
and you urged him to go to London, where he will have no
speciality at all "
“Auntie,” said Mary Chètwynd, "a man who can write
like that can write about anything; it is not a question of
place or opportunity. Why, you know," she continued,
“that all that description of the sea, or of the night-time, or
salmon-fishing, or any occupation of the moment, is only an
excuse ? Surely you can feel that there is something that is
behind all that—something that gets hold of people though
they can scarcely tell how. I will undertake to say he
could make a description of daybreak in Whitechapel as
mysterious and wonderful and interesting as a description
of daybreak at Killarney. Do you think he is going to lose
his eyes because he goes to London ?”.
Miss Chetwynd glanced outside to make sure there was
no one there.
“What the secret of it is I don't know,” she said, “only
he seems to give you the sensation that all the inanimate
things in the world are alive, and watching you, and patiently

sympathetic. Don't you remember, auntie, Mrs. Sims's
solemn vow that never again would she put on her table
flowers that had been forced white in cellars? I told that
to Mr. Fitzgerald to-day; and he laughed and said it was
nonsense; but I thought it was a very pretty compliment.
I want to show him what we are doing in the East-end ; I
think he would understand quick enough, and not misjudge
us. Mind, I will confess this; for a long time I thought
he was merely a sentimental sort of person like- "
“Like me: go on," said the old lady, with a gracious smile.
“No, not like you at all; but like the people who are
delighted to read pathetic stories of the poor, and who
admire kindness in the abstract, but who would not forfeit
their own dinner to keep a whole household from starvation,
and who would shudder with horror if they were asked to
put a sponge to a child's dirty face. Well, we all make
mistakes, I suppose. Those papers showed me I was
mistaken about him, anyway. There is something deeper
than sentiment in his nature. Andand—” continued
the young lady, with a certain embarrassment, for she
seemed to become conscious that she had been talking
very frankly, “—and I am glad he is going away from here
- if only for a time; for I was uneasy about my share in
his coming; and if he were once away, don't you see, dear
auntie, he could decide about coming back or not just as
he pleased, and that would be his own doing. Now I am
ready to be scolded.”
“For what, then ?"
“Oh, perhaps I have not come to the worst,” said the
penitent. “You know, you said I might tell him of your
kind intentions, auntie; and he was very grateful — no
wonder; and even astonished, for he asked why you
should be so kind, whereupon I referred him to the
philosophers who can explain why the sky is blue. But
did I tell you how interested he seemed when I told him
all that is going on down there in the East-end? Did I?
Very well; when he began to talk about his literary
prospects, and of the chance of his gaining an independent
position that way, what do you think he proposed ?-to
give me a contribution !”

“After five hours' talking, what less could he do? I
think you deserved it.”
“But his contribution, auntie dear,—always with your
consent, mind-he said he should like to be Boat of
Garry."
“I don't understand you."
"He meant that—that, if you didn't mind, auntie—he
would give us Boat of Garry, or what it might fetch
rather-
“He shall not; he shall not," said the old lady, with
decision. “You may play ducks and drakes with your
own money, Mary; but no one shall go and throw away
my poor Frank's place on Shadwell or Stepney. I won't
hear of it -
“But if you say not, then not it must be,” remarked the
young lady, good-naturedly. “Of course he could not do
such a thing without your consent "
“I shall not allow it. Why, the idea! Is that all he
cares for the place ?”.
But here Miss Chetwynd grew alarmed. She knew not
what mischief she might not have done.
“Auntie dear," she said, with some eagerness, “there
is no use to say another word about it. It was only a
suggestion. I think he deserves credit for entertaining
such a generous fancy, if only for a moment. Would you
find many young men—fond of riding, and shooting, and
all that—willing to part with such a place? And the idea
that he does not appreciate it; or recognise its beauties !
But I am sure, auntie dear, you would not be the one to
stand in the way of a young man making a great reputation
for himself? And that is why I think he ought to go away
—at least for a time—and establish himself in London.
Give him Boat of Garry, by all means, auntie ; and the
frame of the picture, too; but you would not make the
conditions too rigorous; you could not expect him to
remain here always ; no doubt he would be glad enough to
come here from time to time—the winter shooting, he says,
is excellent- "
“Mary Chetwynd,” said her aunt, with a severity that
was in great part assumed, "you are trying to throw me

off the scent. I can see what you are after. You wish me
to put Mr. Fitzgerald in the position of having independent
means, with no occupation— ".
“I? Was it you or I who proposed that ?" said the
young lady, with some warmth.
“Wait a moment, I see your scheme. You don't
impose upon me, miss. Here you have a young man who
is quick, intelligent, of a generous disposition; and of
course, when he has a fair allowance of money, and
absolutely nothing to do, isn't he the very person-even
supposing that he is not allowed to sell Boat of Garry-to
be carried off and added to your Whitechapel gang? Oh,
I see the whole thing clearly enough; though my eyes are
not as good as they once were. Here you have a clever
young man for your lectures ; and Whitechapel swallows
him up; no one ever sees him again ; literature loses him ;
and Boat of Garry is left empty and useless. So that is
why we go and run a valuable steam-yacht on to a rock;
and that is why we talk for five hours; and no doubt
Whitechapel looks rather a pretty sort of place-in a
distant way— when you have a smooth blue sea and
picturesque mountains round you ?”
The young lady flushed slightly; but she retained her
accustomed good humour.
“ You are quite mistaken, auntie," said she; but now
she spoke in a lower tone, for Fitzgerald was standing on
the lawn outside, putting the pieces of his rod together.
“Mr. Fitzgerald has his own plans. He is not likely to
be led by either you or me. If either, it would be you,
naturally; for he is greatly indebted to you; whereas he
and I are practically strangers. And I know he is anxious
to acquire a position in literature ; and I should not
wonder if, when this book of his comes to be published,
it were to make him quite famous. No, auntie," she
continued, in a lighter way, for Fitzgerald had started off,
“I know what will happen. Your kindness will enable
Mr. Fitzgerald to write just in the way that suits his own
bent; he will be under no anxiety except to do his best
work; and, of course, he will be grateful to you; and you
will be able to produce him at your dinner-table as your

own author. Think of that! You will have him all to
yourself; you alone will know what he is working at; a
real, live, distinguished author constantly on the premises.
For no doubt you will ask him to come and live in Hyde
Park Gardens; and then you can get a study for him by
turning me and my nine-inch telescope out-of-doors. Then
his lordship, when he pleases, will come over here to shoot
wild-duck; and perhaps, auntie dear, you won't mind
sending me a brace now and again to my lodgings in the
Mile End Road, where I shall most likely be starving,
after having sold my telescope and my last pair of boots."
“Go away and tell them to bring tea," said her aunt,
sharply; and so this discussion came to an end.
Meanwhile the object of all this diverse speculation was
making his way down through the meadows to the stream,
his long rod swaying over his shoulder. There was a
contented look on his face on this warm and pleasant
afternoon. The neighbourhood of Boat of Garry seemed
much more cheerful since the arrival of these visitors.
And yet he was not paying much attention to the things
around him ; rather he was amusing himself by drawing
an imaginary picture of what his life would have been had
he been content to accept Mrs. Chetwynd's munificent
offer in its simplicity. He was thinking of himself as owner
of Boat of Garry : living a quiet, solitary, resigned life;
taking what care of the place he could, no matter into
whose hands it was destined ultimately to fall; perhaps,
through industrious stewardship, being able to save some-
thing to send to Miss Chetwynd's charities ; and then from
time to time, in this peaceful and uneventful existence,
jotting down the impressions of these silent hours, and so
maintaining a sort of relationship with the unknown friends
over there in England whom he should never see. He
looked ahead, and beheld himself as another person. A
sensation of being middle-aged came over him. It was in
that character, indeed, that he had written the “Occupa-
tions of a Recluse." There was a tone in them as of
the thinking of one for whom the eager interests of life
were over. He had arrived at the stage of contemplation;
the phenomena of the earth around him were not of much

and haid not ing; thers on
importance, except in so far as they suggested strange
fancies, or became the secret friends and confidants of his
solitary walks by sea and shore.
He was amusing himself with this fancy of what his life
might be. There was the possibility offered him. There
was no need for him to hand over Boat of Garry to Miss
Chetwynd's charities; more than that, it was extremely
doubtful whether Mrs. Chetwynd would allow him. In-
deed, so busy was he with this dream of the future that
when he sat down on a low boundary-wall, and placed his
rod beside him against the stones, and took out his fly-
book, he kept mechanically turning over the leaves and
straightening here and there a bit of feather or fur, and did
not hear the footsteps behind him.
It was the boy that helped Murtough in the stables ;
and he brought two letters. He glanced at the basket;
but did not venture to ask his honour whether he had
caught anything; then he reluctantly left.
These two letters made Fitzgerald's heart beat, and
caused his imagination to be fired with far other dreams
than that of spending an idle contemplative life out of the
world. The first was from the publisher who had already
proposed to issue the “Occupations” in a volume; and
who now put his offer in definite terms: a considerable
sum—a sum that Fitzgerald had not dreamed of—to be
paid down ; with a royalty on each copy after a certain
number had been sold. If Mr. Fitzgerald agreed, would
he proceed with the revision of the papers forthwith?
And did he happen to know of some capable artist who, in
his opinion, would be a fit person to illustrate the book ?
“I think John Ross and I will have a little talk about
this,” he said to himself.
But it was the second letter that he read and re-read
with far greater gratification. That was about money; this
was a personal triumph. It ran as follows:-
"Sloane Street, Wednesday.
“MY DEAR SIR—You may remember that I had the
pleasure of meeting you one evening at Mr. Hilton Clarke's,
when Mr. Scobell, who has obligingly given me your address,

was also present. I had heard a rumour to the effect that
the papers “ The Occupations of a Recluse” were by a Mr.
Fitzgerald ; but I did not identify the name with yourself
until I accidentally met Mr. Scobell, who put me right. It
has since occurred to me that you might find greater freedom
as to choice of subject in the columns of a weekly paper;
although I must confess that Noel appears to have given
you a very wide discretion. His boldness has been justi-
fied; the papers are well spoken of; they are unusual ; they
have the touch of a new hand. Of course I do not say,
Leave the Mirror and come to the Liberal Review; I do
not consider that fair journalism ; but many of the writers
on the daily papers also contribute to the weeklies; and I
merely say that if you happen to have an occasional article
(you might find yourself, for example, with a subject which
would be somewhat too subtle and out-of-the-way for the
hurry of daily newspaper reading) that you chose to send to
us, I should be glad to have it; and as we have two rates of
payment for different kinds of matter, I should be happy
to put you on the most favoured nation scale.
“ Yours faithfully,
“G. GIFFORD.”

His first, quick, proud thought was that he would walk
straight to the house and show this letter to Mary
Chetwynd.
But why to her? She did not know the story. There
was no one now who knew the story; and his triumph was
useless.
He regarded these letters.

that they shadowed forth prospects that ought to have been
alluring enough to a young man of literary tendencies and
aspirations. Indeed, as he looked at them, and guessed
at all they hinted at, that career seemed to him a more
noble and useful one than hiding himself away from the
world in this solitary place and avoiding the cares and
anxieties and victories of life altogether. And so he was

to become an author at last-perhaps even one who might
win in some small measure the affection of the great many.
eyed, many-hearted, and not ungrateful public? And to
write for the Liberal Review—that seemed almost as great
a wonder: not standing, as of old, at the foot of the little
stair, and anxiously awaiting the fate of a timid essay about
some one else's work; but allowed to mount into his own
small pulpit, as it were, and deliver forth his own utterances,
if haply one here or there cared to listen to a whisper from
the hills or a murmur from the wide seas amid the jangle
of political life. It seemed a wonderful thing. He could
scarcely rest. He wanted to be away and begin at once.
The great world was calling him from these still solitudes;
the picture was opening out before him ; to what possible
goal might he not attain ?
And then somehow—as a sudden sob breaks the silence
of the night, and the hushed and hidden grief reveals itself,
and all the darkness is shuddering with the old and cease-
less pain—just as quickly and terribly flashed across his
consciousness the words “ Too late—too late!” The time
for these brave dreams was over now. A man does not
strive but towards an end; does not fight without hope of
reward ; does not strike for a great future if it is for himself
alone. “Too late—too late!” And he had pretty well
schooled himself by this time; and knew when it was time
to give up thinking; and was as well aware as any one of
the stupidity of idle regret. So he deliberately and calmly
put in his pocket the letters; and chose, with patient care,
the flies he wanted ; and went down among the tall weeds
by the side of the river. It was a pleasant afternoon; the
water was in good condition ; he must not return to the
house without a sea-trout for dinner.
For a long time he had exceeding bad luck. The
stream abounded with small river-trout, that would keep
playing with the big sea-trout fies, occasionally suffering
.for their folly by finding themselves twitched into the air
and then foundering on the grass. This necessitated his
fixing the rod upright and going and getting the diminutive
beast off the hook, while there was every probability that
in flopping about it had caught one of the other flies in the

m without water, himcept as to
nen and aca but he suddenne
weeds. And then again he had to be careful about restoring
the captive to its native element, for the flash and shoot of
it might alarm some more noble fish. But he worked away,
whipping industriously and mechanically, not thinking of
anything in particular except as to how to get the flies
lightly on the water, himself unseen, and how to recover
them without catching up on the bank.
At last there was a sudden “flop !" that well he knew
the sound of; but he struck too quickly or too sharply.
Again and again he dexterously dropped the flies over the
same bit of water ; but there was no response; perhaps
the fish had been touched and had learnt caution. He
was beginning to think that he must return to the house
empty-handed, when, lower down, there was another
“flop !” instantly followed by a sharp whirr of the reel ;
then again by a deliberate “sulk," during which time he
rapidly got in his line again, keeping on all the strain he
dared. He was now in an excellent position, for the fish
had taken refuge in a narrow deep little pool beyond some
gravelly shallows, and as it was at a bend in the river, he,
standing on the neck of land, could have fair command of
the fish whichever way he went. However, he now knew
pretty well how many and how various were the accidents
possible on this little stream, where there was no chance
for that fine, leisurely playing of the fish that can be in-
dulged in on an open loch with impunity; and so he kept
on the full strain of his tackle, ready for whatever might
happen
He had very little trouble, however. The fish made
one long rush up stream; but fortunately kept almost in
mid-channel. Then it leaped out of the water twice; but
without doing damage. Then it sulked again ; but it was
evidently growing weaker. Finally, after one or two slow,
quiet sailings up and down, it allowed itself to be gently
guided into the side, where a cautious and then quick swoop
of the landing-net speedily deposited it on the grass-a
beauty of a sea-trout of apparently about three pounds
weight.
Well, he thought that was quite enough, seeing it was
getting near dinner-time; and Mrs. Chetwynd could not

bear unpunctuality; while, of course, he had to exchange
his jacket and knickerbockers for a more suitable costume.
So he popped the fish in the basket; and was striding home
through the meadows that led up to the house, when he
saw Miss Chetwynd coming to him through the trees. She
had evidently been expecting him.
“Have you caught anything ?" she said pleasantly.
“A fairish sea-trout,” he said, “ about three pounds. I
am afraid it won't be in time for dinner.”
“It won't,” she said. “It is near dinner-time now.
Mr. Fitzgerald,” she added, “I wanted to say a word to
you, before going in. You hinted something about hand-
ing over Boat of Garry to me, to help these various things
of mine. It was kind of you. But please don't even men-
tion such a project to auntie. She will not hear of it;
when I spoke of it she was very nearly being angry in
earnest; and that does not often happen. No; you must
take Boat of Garry, and keep to her wishes; you will find
them considerate and reasonable enough.”
“But what kind of use could I put it to?" said he, rather
bewildered at the moment.
They had reached the corner of the avenue, and the
house was visible. She regarded him for a second.
“That is hardly for me to say," she said slowly. “But
I think if you were to take Boat of Garry, as my aunt
wishes to give it to you, you would be in a position in which
you could do a great deal of good to many, many people.”
He could not stay to ask her to explain, even if she
were willing to explain; for he had but little time in which
to get ready for dinner. During that brief operation, how-
ever, some odd fancies occurred to him. If certain things
were now no longer possible to him in the world, might
not others be? Was it so necessary to human happiness
that life should be crowned by either love or ambition?
Look at Mary Chetwynd, now. Her life seemed valuable
enough to her, because she could make it valuable to
others; it was a beautiful life in its sweet serenity, its
cheerfulness, its atmosphere of frankness and kindness and
content. Her philosophy was perhaps not very profound;
but at least it was practical : “We enjoy such things as we

Kine world; a scarcely 3 into her
have through the best people having done their best ; let
us try and do the same; and make the lives of those who
have been borne down in the struggle a little more tolerable.”
It was impossible to imagine a happier human being than
she seemed to be; fitting accurately and easily into her
surroundings; full of cares that were scarcely anxieties;
satisfied with her place in the world ; a dispenser of light.
It seemed strange for this King's daughter to spend the best
part of her life in Whitechapel ; but perhaps she could not
be just quite what she was if she did otherwise ? At all
events, she had found out something. That perfect seren-
ity of content could not be the fruit merely of nature and
disposition; it must be the outcome of nature and disposi-
tion finding fitting work and occupation. And if a woman's
instinct had found out a way of living which seemed to
make the world around her in the eyes of all beholders)
more sweet and cheerful and wholesome, might it not be
worth while enquiring what that was ?
Now, no sooner had they sat down to dinner than the
old lady, with a trifle of enforced gaiety to hide a certain
nervousness, began to unfold to him her designs.
“Mary and I have been having a dreadful quarrel about
you,” she said.
“I am sorry for that," was his answer, “But it does
not appear as if much harm had been done."
“You must know that Mary and I have been sketching
out a career for you—only with a difference—and drawing
out plans. Of course the time is very appropriate ; for
one might almost regard you as making a new start in
life-
“I?” said he, in great alarm. Had she guessed then
of that mortal crisis through which he had come, when the
value seemed to go out of life altogether, and death to take
its place as the more desirable thing?
“Yes; with all the people talking about the new writer.
Of course you will be quite a different person when you
return to London. Do you think, when you become great
and famous, that we shall expect you to come and read
accounts of murders to a poor old blind woman?”.

he said, honestly enough. “But I should like to earn my
living by literature. And I think I might be able to do
that; I have just had two letters that give me good hope.
But do you think that is any reason why I should prove
myself ungrateful for all your kindness ? I may be able to
earn my living at literature, as I say; and then I would
not ask you for the salary you have been kind enough to
give me—you might hand it over to Miss Chetwynd for her
charities; but that need not prevent my coming to read to
you each afternoon, just as before, if you will allow me,
For I know,” he added, more lightly, "precisely what you
like in the way of literature and news; and I would not
hand you over to your niece again, who would make you
believe that the magazines and newspapers contained
nothing but reports of Sanitary Commissions and things
like that--"
"Now I call that too bad,” said Mary Chetwynd. "I
read to auntie for years, and never got “Thank you ;' you
read for a few months, and she gives you Boat of Garry!
And then to have insult heaped upon me as well—_”
“But, Mr. Fitzgerald,” interrupted Mrs. Chetwynd, with
some little agitation, "you speak of handing over something
to Mary's charities. And Mary said you had made some
suggestion. Now you must understand this—do not think
I am unreasonable—but you must really understand that
any proposal of that kind with regard to Boat of Garry is
out of the question. I will give you the place. I will give
you enough to keep it up; and a surplus for your own ex-
penses. But either let or sold or mortgaged Boat of Garry
shall not be."
“But, auntie dear," said Mary Chetwynd, in her soft
persuasive voice, “Mr. Fitzgerald understands that. I told
him. It was only a chance suggestion of his-generous
but impracticable. You need not worry yourself about it,
more especially as you can easily put it out of the power
of any one to sell the place. Only I would not have you
make any one a present with any doubt remaining in your
mind. Mr. Fitzgerald won't sell Boat of Garry."
“If it were handed over to me like that,” said he, simply
enough, “surely I could not do less than consider I held

it on trust? It should be done with entirely and merely
as you wished."
“I would rather make it binding on your honour than
leave it to the lawyers,” said she, in a calmer way. “And
what I should like would be to have the place kept exactly
as it is; and to be well looked after; so that, if you should
at any time think of asking us to come and look at it, it
would be really coming to the old place again, and seeing
it just as it was when—when my poor boy was so proud of
it. For why should you not be proud of it too? It is a
pretty place
“Mrs. Chetwynd,” said he, "you speak as if something
were needed to make your splendid offer acceptable to me.
I don't think you can understand what it is to a young
fellow of my age to be made independent for that is
what it would come to; to have his place in the world
made sure for him; and that place a most attractive one.
I have been near starvation once or twice- and not so
long ago. And now you offer me an assured income;
and all kinds of luxuries; and yet you imagine that I don't
quite appreciate your kindness, or might be so ungrateful
as to do with the property something not according to your
wishes. I don't think you need have much fear.”
“I will trust to your honour, and not to the lawyers,”
she said. “I will make no conditions when the transfer-
ence is drawn out. I won't ask you to take our name, as
I had thought of doing ; it will be enough if you do what
I want with the place. And if the money is not enough,
there will be more. But about the name; I will ask you
to let me call you Willie, when you come to see us in
London—if you do not mind.”
“Oh no~it is only another part of your kindness."
“It is a bargain, then ?”
“If you wish it to be, Mrs. Chetwynd,” he was saying,
rather doubtfully, for he was wondering whether she would
always approve of what she had done, and perhaps was
thinking of asking her to take time to reflect. But he
caught the look of Mary Chetwynd's face. There was a
touch of surprise there—almost of reproach. She seemed
to say, “Why do you hesitate? Is that the way to accept

such a gift ?" So he only said: “If I only knew how to
thank you ?”
“Never mind that,” said the old lady, good-naturedly.
“It is a bargain, then? Shake hands on it !"
So he rose and went round, and they shook hands
hand in mute token of gratitude, and went back to his seat.
The ceremony was a brief one; but after that she never
expressed any anxiety as to what might become of Boat of
Garry.
“And now about yourself— " She hesitated for a
second, and flushed a little. Evidently she had tried to
call him “ Willie," and had failed. “Tell me what your
plans are. Mary says you would like to go back to London.”
“I was thinking I should like to get back for a short
time; but it is of little consequence; I will remain here if
you prefer it."
“Oh, but that won't do at all. I did not buy you into
slavery like that. The landlord of Boat of Garry must do
as he pleases. You shall go back to London to-morrow
if you wish.”
“I could not do that either," said he, with a smile.
“For I was thinking, if you did not object, I would ask
my artist friend, John Ross, to come over here and make
some sketches. They talk of putting illustrations into the
volume they are going to publish for me ; and if Mr. Ross
were to come to Boat of Garry-I mean, if you didn't mind
it-I could show him where to make his sketches, and I
suppose they could transform them into woodcuts."
“Bless the boy," the old lady said, with her pretty
laugh. “Is he asking for permission to invite a man to
come to his own house ?”.
“He is rather a wild sort of colt, and not easily led,"
Fitzgerald said, doubtfully.
“For my part,” said Mary Chetwynd, who had not
spoken for some time, "whoever goes back, I must, very
soon."
“Mary, there is not a soul in London !" her aunt
exclaimed.
“Is there not, auntie ? I can assure you that my friends

about the Mile End Road don't go to Biarritz or Mentone
-not as a rule."
“Why, now, I wanted Mr. Fitzgerald to go back with
us-after a little while— just to have everything put
straight- "
"Oh, I don't mind waiting here for a little while yet,”
Mary Chetwynd said, at once. “I think I have earned a
little longer holiday; and as for you, auntie, as you are a
good-for-nothing, it does not matter where you are."
“And I thought we might make the homeward journey
in part a driving excursion-going round by way of Killar-
ney. Wouldn't that be charming ?”.
“Killarney?" said Fitzgerald, with a quick catching of
the breath. And he could only add : “Oh, do you think
so?"
“Don't you ?" she said, regarding him with astonish-
ment. “Have you, an Irishman, anything to say against
Killarney ?"
“Oh no,” he said, rather under his breath. And then
he stammered "—No doubt Killarney is very pretty—oh
yes, pretty enough. But—but it is scarcely anything more,
is it? Perhaps I am not just to it. But I don't care
about fresh-water lakes—the mysterious association of the
sea is so wonderful a thing.-Do-do you really think it
would be worth while taking all the time to drive round
by Killarney ?"
“Then what do you say to Inisheen ?”.
She did not notice that the blood forsook his face for a
second. But Mary Chetwynd noticed it, and said quickly-
“Auntie, I declare to you I am not going to waste my
time in driving-excursions. These are for idle people.
And Dan and Wellington always get fidgety when they are
put up in strange stables; do you mean to have our necks
broken ?”
“My dear, I wanted Mr. Fitzgerald to show us some
of the wonderful places he has described
“But you can see them all around here," said her niece.
“There is far more of Boat of Garry than of Inisheen-if
it is Inisheen-in the papers. And what we ought to do
is to give all the time we can spare to Mr. Ross, sº that

we shall have Boat of Garry glorified, and made as famous
as the book is sure to be. So I, for one, vote against both
Killarney and Inisheen; those on the other side may hold
their right hands—their right hand-up."
“Well, you always have your own way, Mary,” her aunt
said contentedly.
“And, indeed, auntie, you have not yet asked Mr.
Fitzgerald whether he would prefer to go with us or rather
choose his own time? It isn't every one who cares to go
travelling with women. Now what I consider would be
the reasonable and sensible plan would be this ".
“Whatever agrees with your own wishes, Mary, is al-
ways the reasonable and sensible plan," said her aunt,
with a smile.
“Well, but listen. The opposition can hold up its
right hand when the proper time comes. Mr. Fitzgerald
ought to go back to London shortly to arrange about his
literary affairs there. I must go back; for there are too
many of us away at this time of year. Now we will assume
that Mr. Fitzgerald will either be, or pretend to be, content
to be burdened with us two women-and take our tickets
and all the rest of it—and get grumbled at if we lose any-
thing—and so, what I say is, let us have a little longer
holiday here, not bothering about any Killarney or Inisheen;
then let us all go back to London ; then let Mr. Fitzgerald,
when his affairs there are put in proper train, come back
here, along with Mr. Ross, for the shooting. What a pity
it would be to miss the shooting "
“Well, you are right there, Mary,” said the old lady,
eagerly; for was she not anxious that Fitzgerald should
appreciate all the advantages of the place she had given
him?
“And of what use are women in a house at such a time?
After a hard day on the hill, the men always go to sleep
after dinner. Then, according to my plan, there would be
no hurry; and Mr. Ross could do his sketches at his own
leisure, and do justice to the scenery; and we should all
be very pleased to have such a nice souvenir of the place,
For who knows what turn affairs may take ; and who knows
whether Mr. Fitzgerald may be inclined to ask us ever

PLANS AND DREAMS

again to visit Boat of Garry? I was going to suggest that
he might invite us for Christmas; but Christmas is too
busy a time with me.”
“I was going to say, Mrs. Chetwynd," said Fitzgerald,
who had been sitting with his eyes fixed on the table-
and he spoke rather slowly and with a trifle of embarrass-
ment-" that if you would prefer driving round by Killar-
ney, I should be most happy to go that way with you ;
and to Inisheen also, if you wished it.”
“Oh, I wash my hands of the whole affair," the cheerful
old lady said, “I have nothing to do with it. She arranges
everything. Settle it between you. I am nothing but a
doll in her hands."
“But then you are such a pretty doll, auntie, dear,” her
niece said, “and such a gentle and well-behaved doll, I have
never the least trouble with you. Now come outside before
it gets too dark; and we will have coffee there. All the
evening sounds are so soft and quiet just before the night
comes on; and you will have a thick shawl wrapped round
your head and shoulders, auntie; and we will wait for the
new moon; and turn over all the silver in our pockets.
Poor old Boat of Garry-it has gone away into the hands of
strangers; but we will have one more quiet evening outside
the porch, listening to the stream ; until the moon comes up
behind the acacia, and then it will be time to get in-doors
again.”
It was a peaceful night-a night to be remembered. To
one of them there, it seemed as if some haven might be
reached after all, -of content, and affection, and gratitude.
The darkness gathered over hill and shore; the moon rose
into the clear heavens behind the trembling acacia leaves ;
the stream murmured down there beyond the lawn; the air
was soft from the sea. A gracious night. There was hardly
any need for speaking; it was enough to sit and watch the
moon slowly rise, and the faint light tell on the grass and
the gravel. Then there was a stirring of leaves around, and
the air felt colder; it was with something of a sigh that they
got up, and took their things with them, and went in-doors;
leaving the slumbering world and the scarcely breathing sea
to the silence and the stars.

When Fitzgerald went up to his room later on, after
having bade them good-night, and also having made another
sort of effort to let the old lady know that he was fully sen-
sible of her great generosity towards him, he found a half-
sheet of notepaper placed somewhat prominently on the
dressing-table; and at the first glance he recognised the
clear, pretty handwriting to be that of Mary Chetwynd.
There was no message or explanation; only these words—
“I hereby promise to contribute twenty pounds a year to the
fund for providing toys for Hospital children.”
Well, he sat down and contemplated these words,
knowing very well what they meant. It was an invitation to
him to give to those poor children some small portion of
the bounties that had been heaped on him. And the more
he thought of it the more he was convinced that it would
be a very strange thing if his literary efforts could not
produce a yearly sum as great as that, or even considerably
greater. As for the monetary arrangements that Mrs.
Chetwynd might be disposed to make, he knew nothing
about them as yet; but he understood that practically he
was to have an income that would render him independent.
Surely, then, literature might enable him to do as much as
this or more ? So he went and got a pen, and scored out
the word “twenty," and inserted the word "fifty,” adding
his signature in full — William Fitzgerald. And then he
enclosed this document in an envelope, which he addressed
to Miss Chetwynd ; thinking he would leave it on the
breakfast-table for her in the morning, without another
word.

THE BOOK

CHAPTER XXX.
THE BOOK.
Well, in due course of time—that is to say, about the end
of October—the original “ Occupations of a Recluse,” along
with numerous additions, and with a series of illustrations
taken from sepia drawings by John Ross, were given to the
public in book form, and almost instantly commanded a
very large sale indeed, and were widely talked of. The
publishers happened to be masters of the art of doing a
good thing well; and had spared neither trouble nor cost
in getting these sepia drawings transformed into a set of
admirable woodcuts; while many people who had read the
“Occupations” in a fugitive way as they appeared in the
Daily Mirror, were glad to have them in this permanent
form. Moreover, the reviewers received the book favour-
ably, although one or two rather complainingly asked how
they could be expected to classify this amorphous hotch-
potch of philosophy, poetry, and snipe-shooting, as if there
were any necessity that they should classify it at all; while
the Liberal Review said that, although the writer of these
papers was a contributor to their own columns (editors are
but human, and cannot avoid these little touches), they did
not see that was any reason why they should not praise
good work when they found it. And when the Liberal
Review people set about praising a book, they do it.
In the circumstances it was not likely that Mr. Scobell
should miss his opportunity; and forthwith he made his way
down to the Fulham Road. Fitzgerald still occupied the
long low-roofed room there, for the sake of auld lang syne ;

but now there was a heavy portière shutting off the bedroom
end; and there were some comfortable chairs, and more
cheerful-looking rugs; while over the fireplace stood two
brilliant Chanak-Kalesi jugs that Miss Chetwynd had given
him, and that were the sole ornament of the room. Mrs.
Chetwynd, indeed, had begged of him to take some better
rooms in one of the streets leading from Piccadilly; but
he asked to be excused; for he had no mind to spend
much money on himself. In fact, he was living pretty
much in his old way; although, on one occasion, when
both aunt and niece went down to his humble lodging, to
have afternoon tea, he went to the extravagance, before-
hand, of purchasing a modern Japanese tea-set and a few
pots of flowers. It was then that Miss Chetwynd said the
room looked far too bare, and promised him the two green
and scarlet jugs..
"My dear f’lah,” said Mr. Scobell, laying his hat and
cane on the table, and taking off his yellow gloves, “let me
congratulate you! You have done it at a bound—at a
bound. It is the only book talked of at every dinner-table
you go to: By Jove, sir, when I told them last night at
Lady Lampley's that I knew every inch of your career, I
found everybody listening. And I knew it ; I predicted it;
I said so to Gifford. I said to him when I met him,
'Gifford, my dear f’lah, you don't know what people are
talking about ; you are in your own set. You keep among
a literary set ; and don't know what society is talking about;
why don't you get Fitzgerald to write for you; why should
he write only for the Mirror-a trades'-union, Methodistical,
Republican rag like that?' Not that I approve of the
politics of the Liberal Review either; you can't expect me;
but what I say is that the Liberal Review is a gentlemanly
sort of paper after all; you see it in good houses; when I
go into my club I find it lying about.”
All this while he was looking around.
“My dear f'lah, this won't do at all. When a penniless,
supercilious good-for-nothing like that fellow Hilton Clarke

Darme, sir, you should have rooms in Curzon Street, and
a private hansom, and a hack for the Park! I am told that
Mrs. Chetwynd makes you a very handsome allowance."
“She does. But, you know, literature is best cultivated
on a little oatmeal. And I find enough to do with my
spare cash in another way.”
“Oh, but my dear Fitzgerald," said Mr. Scobell, with a
lofty smile, “ you are throwing away your chances! You
might go everywhere—you might go to the very best
houses. I'll tell you what, now—my wife shall send you a
card for one of her At Homes; and you ought really to
come, don't you know; you'll meet some of the very best
people, I give you my word. What's more; I want you,
like a good f'lah, to give me a night for a little dinner at
my club. It isn't a big club, it isn't one of the big swell
clubs, isn't the Abercorn, but you'll meet a very good class
of men there, I can tell you. And I'll ask old Gifford, if
you like; and anybody else you like, and we'll have a
little bit of a celebration, don't you know ; for I tell you
what it is, Fitzgerald, old f’lah, I feel as if I had had a
finger in the pie, don't you know, and—and damme if I'm
not proud of it; and precious glad that you've made such
a hit!”
There was really some frank good-nature mixed up with
the man's vanity. He took out his note-book.
“What night shall it be?” he said. “Let it be a
Saturday, the 15th or the 22d, and we'll have a house-
dinner; and you'll see if the Abercorn can't give you as
good a dinner and as good a glass of wine as any club in
London.”
“Either night you like, then.”
“We'll say the 22d to give more time. What I say is,
do a thing well. A man has no right to ask me to dine at
his club, and give me the sort of dinner you'd get at a
d-d common restaurant. When I ask a man to my club
I want him to have the best that's in the kitchen and the
cellar; and I'm not above taking trouble about it. What
I say is, do the thing well. There's a lot of people, don't
you know, nowadays who pretend to be above all that;

to Philharmony soul, anda boleh ang orience here in
good cigars is beneath their high mightinesses' notice;
they pretend they prefer water to a claret that cost you a
hundred shillings a dozen. Rubbish-all rubbish. What
I say is, the good things of this life wouldn't be there if
they weren't to be used ; and I suppose Providence knows
as much about what's good for you as any of the scientific
swells. There's a good deal of that sort of nonsense goes
on at the Chetwynds'; but the Chetwynds are not in fault.
Upon my soul, I don't think it's respectful to your hostess
to nibble a bit of bread and a cutlet, and drink a glass of
water, and call that your dinner; I don't think it's nice; I
call it bad form, I do; if any fellow did that at my table,
I'm hanged if he'd find himself there again. The 22d,
seven forty-five, good.”
This was the true object of his visit; and he clasped his
note-book together again with a satisfied air. Then he
took up his hat and gloves.
“You made a suggestion—you were kind enough-- "
said Fitzgerald, timidly; and then he frankly said "I
wish you would ask my friend Ross, too, who made the
sketches, you know.”
“Delighted! My dear f'lah, a thousand thanks for the
hint. Delighted !".
He took out his note-book again.
“Give me his address; and I will write to him at once.
Delighted, I assure you. A deuced clever fellow that; the
landscapes Mrs. Chetwynd has of his are excellent-I call
them first-rate."
“But he lives just below,” Fitzgerald said, looking at his
watch. “And he will probably be at work now. Will you
go down and see him ?”.
“By all means."
They went down the stairs and knocked at the door of
the studio, and were admitted, apologising for their in-
trusion.
“Not a bit,” said John Ross, who had his pipe in
his fingers. “Come in. I was painting the portrait of
the collie there; and he's not a good sitter; he was con-
tinually falling asleep; and I got tired o'whistling the poor
creature awake; and was having a glint at the newspaper.'

litely done occanos, inddistinguishy dinner what can
Mr. Scobell looked strangely around at the big, gaunt,
dusty studio. And then, with much roundabout phrase-
ology and compliment, he explained the object of his visit ;
Ross's reply being briefly-
“Yes, I will."
But Mr. Scobell did not stop there. He began to make
a round of the studio; and to offer remarks; while John
Ross became a trifle. peevish.
“Now I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Ross,” said he, in
his grand manner. “I don't see that an artist who can
paint like that should not be known. I'll tell you what I'll
do; I'll ask Sydenham to come to this very dinner.”
Mr. Sydenham was a very distinguished painter and
Academician; the husband, indeed, of the lady whom
Fitzgerald had on one occasion taken down to supper, and
who had politely declined to be bribed by sandwiches.
“Sydenham's a good fellow, a deuced good fellow;
and a word from him would do you no harm. Now that
is a mistake of so many of you artists and authors, don't
you know; you keep hidden away among yourselves; and
you don't go about, and get to know the people you ought
to know. I daresay, now, you never met an Academician
in your life ?"
“The Academy and I are no likely to become great
friends," said Ross, drily. “I am a heretic. I will not
conform. I like to paint in my own fashion; and they let
me; and they go their way, and I go mine; and there is
no quarrel between us. Indeed I am not sure but that
they try to do me a favour when they put anything I send
them near the roof—the effect of distance, you see, may
soften the things down a bit-
“But you don't mean to say, now," remarked Mr.
Scobell, coming to a dead pause before a rough sketch
that was propped up on the mantelpiece-a very rough
sketch, indeed, of a farmyard, with one or two cattle and a
heap of straw warm in sunlight, “ that they would not give
a good place to a picture like that? Now I call that
uncommonly good. I have seen a good many pictures in
my time. I have been to half the galleries in Europe,
and precious sick of them I got sometimes, I can tell you.

I don't profess to be a judge ; but I know a good picture
when I see it; and I say that calf is as well painted a calf
as anybody could want. Rough,” said he waving his hand
slightly, “a little rough. Wanting in finish, don't you
know. But a first-rate sketch; what I call an uncommon
good sketch. I should not mind having that hung up in
my hall. But the gable of the house is a leetle tumble-over,
isn't it?—I would suggest "
He took the canvas down, and held it out at arm's
length, examining it critically.
“It is nothing-it is a daub," said John Ross, rather
impatiently, and he got the canvas out of his hands and
put it up again, with its face to the wall.
But Mr. Scobell resumed possession of it; and again
held it out at arm's length.
“No, no," he said patronisingly, “it has merit. It is
well balanced. I call the light and shade of that sketch
very well balanced, indeed. And I am not afraid to trust
my own judgment. I never give an opinion without
being ready to back it with money. My notion is that a
man should buy pictures that please himself; why should
he care what other people think? No, what I say is that's
a very good sketch; an uncommon good sketch it is; very
well balanced light and shadow; and the long and the
short of it is, Mr.-Mr. Ross—that I will buy it. I should
not be at all ashamed to have that sketch hung up in my
hall- 4"
But now the red-bearded artist became very angry; and
got hold of the unlucky sketch; and sent it spinning to the
end of the studio, where it unhappily hit the sleeping collie,
that forthwith sprang up with a howl, and slunk into a
farther corner, with its tail between its legs.
“I would not have such a thing go out of the place,"
said he, briefly.
But he soon recovered his temper; and when at last
Mr. Scobell, after much more encouraging and soothing
advice and criticism, had left, all that John Ross said to
his friend about the visitor was merely-
“Man, he's a bletherer, that one.”
They went to the dinner, however, at the Abercorn Club;

383
and a very sumptuous affair it was. They had the Strangers'
Dining-room to themselves; and it was brilliantly lit; and
the table was magnificently decorated with flowers. Of the
gentlemen present Fitzgerald only knew his host, his com-
panion Ross, Mr. Gifford, and, by sight, Mr. Sydenham;
but he was introduced to the others by Mr. Scobell, with a
series of pompous little compliments, the ordeal not being
the less severe that these portly middle-aged persons
regarded him with such a silent, blank, lack-lustre-eyed
scrutiny that he was on the point of saying, “Upon my
soul I don't bite." He wondered what manner of men
these were; and the mystery was not rendered less inscrut-
able when, after they had sat down, Mr. Scobell remarked
to him in an undertone-
“There's seven millions at this table.”
According to Fitzgerald's way of counting there were
only ten persons; so he was more hopelessly in a fog than
ever.
“Seven millions, if there's a farthing," continued Mr.
Scobell, in the same low tone. “And as you and your
friend Ross and Sydenham and I have little enough, you
may imagine what the other six have amongst them. The
man opposite me and his right hand neighbour are Directors
of the Bank of England.”
Then Fitzgerald began to see. No wonder these gentle-
men were grave if they had the responsibility of owning
seven millions of money weighing on them ; and there was
a business-like seriousness in the way they attacked their
dinner, not turning aside for frivolous pleasantries, but
keeping a sharp eye on the successive dishes. In course
of time, however, the severity of their demeanour abated;
the staccato remarks about the probability of another
European war, which hitherto had represented their con-
versation, developed into an unanimous abuse of the
foreign policy of the then French Government; and then
again one funny man, at the end of the table, would
succeed in getting his next neighbour to laugh (when not
too busy). John Ross and the great Academician appeared
to have become friends at once, and were talking in an
animated fashion ; Mr. Gifford was rather in an absent

frame of mind; while Scobell,, at the head of the table,
beamed and shone upon his guests in silence.
“Well, Fitzgerald,” said Mr. Gifford, at length, “since
we last dined together, one of the little group has rather
dropped under.”
“Do you know anything about him? Do you know
where he is ?” said his neighbour, knowing well whom he
meant.
“In Paris. Not very well off, I fear. They say he is
going to marry Lady Ipswich after the decree nisi is made
absolute; and I believe her friends have made some small
provision for her; but Clarke had always expensive habits,
and I am afraid he is a little given to borrowing. But they
have a pretty house, I am told, just outside the Marble
Arch.”
“ The Arc de Triomphe,” his neighbour suggested.
“Well, yes : what did I say? I hope his book will be
successful; but the subject has so little interest for the
general public "
“His book? What book ?"
“ It came to the office the day before yesterday, I think.
The Laws and Limitations of Art it is called-
“Oh, I wish you would let me review it !” Fitzgerald
exclaimed, with an eagerness that made his companion
regard him with a quick look.
“No," said Mr. Gifford, with an odd kind of smile; “we
could not have one of our own reviewers abused in our
own reviewing columns.”
“Your columns ?” said Fitzgerald in bewilderment.
“Does Hilton Clarke write for you?"
“Sometimes," was the answer. “The Weekly Gazette
got tired of him long ago; and he appealed to me. There
are one or two things he can do very well. I am sorry
for the fellow. I hope his book will be successful; but I
doubt it."
“Why won't you let me review it, then?" said Fitz-
gerald, who was on pretty familiar terms with the editor.
“You had some squabble with him, hadn't you, about
the Household Magazine ?” said Mr. Gifford, with his
piercing eyes regarding him. “I gathered from Scobell

that he had treated you rather badly. Well, that is nothing
new; but still
“Oh, if you mean that,” Fitzgerald said hastily, "you
are quite mistaken. It is quite the other way. I meant
to say everything I could for the book. He did owe me
some money; but then, on the other hand, I owe him
something. But for him I daresay I should at this moment
be the sub-editor of the Cork Chronicle. I should like to
praise the book.”
“That is quite as bad a temper," said Mr. Gifford.
“We will get some more impartial person—but some
friendly person, I hope. And why should you want to
write reviews ? Scobell tells me you are now the owner
of an estate in Ireland ; and have a handsome income
besides."
“I want to make all the money I can,” Fitzgerald said,
“ for I know plenty of uses for it. And as for the Irish
estate, I consider myself only the steward of it; though I
get shooting and fishing for nothing; and also the most
delightful quiet when there is a chance of running over.
Ask your neighbour-oh, let me introduce you : Mr. Ross,
Mr. Gifford—ask him-he is an artist—what he thinks of
Boat of Garry."
Mr. Gifford thereupon turned to John Ross, and Fitz-
gerald was left unoccupied, whereupon Mr. Scobell, who
had overheard some chance phrase, said-
“I say, my dear f'lah, what did you mean by that
dedication pi Upon my life, I don't know whether the
dear old lady was more pleased by it or more indignant.
She did not speak to you about it, perhaps ?”.
“Yes, she did. She thanked me; that was all. What
was there to be indignant about ?”
“My dear Mr. Scobell,” she said to me—you see,

Fitzgerald, I have known the Chetwynds for many years;
they have always been in our set. “My dear Mr. Scobell,'
she said, 'what does the lad mean by describing me as of
Boat of Garry? Won't he take it when I give it to him?
He wanted to give it to Mary, to squander away; and
now he wants to saddle me with it. Can't I get rid of it
anyhow ?!"
"Oh, but that is all right,” said Fitzgerald. “That is
quite settled and understood. Mrs. Chetwynd and I
understand the position perfectly; and so also does M-
Miss Chetwynd.”
So the banquet went on; the talk becoming generally
louder; with gushes of laughter here or there; and perhaps
nothing occurred particularly deserving of mention except
that one tall and portly gentleman, of a most severe and
repellent countenance, who had been boring everybody
to death about his travels in Armenia, was heard to
remark, in the most innocent manner, of a well-known
statesman whom they were discussing, “Well, all I can
say is that he is a man of very strange fancies, very
strange fancies indeed. He took a most unaccountable
dislike to myself. A most singular thing. Yes, and he
showed it too— damme, he showed it;" and also that
Master Willie, by a base and unworthy subterfuge, ob-
tained a triumph over his enemy of former days. For
he began to talk to Mr. Gifford about familiar quota-
tions; and in the most naïve manner observed that few
were better known than
“De par le Roi, défense à Dieu,
D'opérer miracle en ce lieu."
The editor fell into the trap headlong.
“De faire miracle-de faire miracle, I think," said he,
politely.
“ D'opérer, I think it is,” said Fitzgerald, graciously.
“Pardon me, I am sure you are wrong. It is a most
familiar quotation. De faire miracle en ce lieu.”
“I would not contradict you; for, as you say, the
couplet is so well known.”
"Oh, there is not a doubt of it — not a doubt of

it. Every schoolboy knows it. De faire miracle, of
course."
“My authority for d'opérer," continued his foe, in an
absent and indifferent kind of way, pretending to be very
busy in examining the constituents of a mysterious-looking
sweet, “is not very absolute. I found it in the Notes to
an old edition I have of Voltaire's Pucelle ; along with a
little history of St. Paris. The date of the edition is 1773;
and the couplet is spoken of as being familiar. But perhaps
it is a misquotation.”
"Perhaps, perhaps," said Mr. Gifford; but he lightly
changed the subject and wanted Fitzgerald to tell him how
the Game Laws affected the poorer tenantry in the south-
west of Ireland. And Fitzgerald imparted to him what
information he could on that subject, without recalling to
him the fact that they had had a dispute about the same
couplet in former days when they did not meet on quite such
equal terms.
At last the bounteous feast came to an end; and there
was much hand-shaking on the steps of the Abercorn Club.
As far as Fitzgerald was concerned, it very soon appeared
that this big dinner might, if he chose, be regarded as only
the beginning of a quite indefinite series of similar repasts,
though perhaps of a more domestic kind, for the little book
made its way in a remarkable manner; and probably there
was something in its contents that made people curious
about the personality of the author; and, no doubt, he
might have figured at a great many afternoon teas, and
dinner-parties, and midnight receptions. But, as it turned
out, he found his life far too full of occupation for anything
of the kind. When he dined at all in the evening, he
went to, or stayed for, Mrs. Chetwynd's table d'hôte ;
and it is more than probable that he would have earned
the contempt of Mr. Scobell by his indifference to the
good things of this world, or such of them as appeared
on the dinner-table. But it was a fine thing, this con-
stant and busy occupation; this finding that both time
and money were inadequate to the calls made upon him.
The “old, hysterical mock - disease ” got in a manner
jostled out of existence ; there was no longer any room

for it. That was all left behind now; — except, alas !
when the wonder-world of sleep was opened ; and again
he was walking with Kitty on the sunny Sunday mornings
along the hawthorn lanes outside of Cork: or rowing her
home in the moonlight, she singing the while, past the
silent quays of Inisheen.

CHAPTER XXXI.
IN THE EAST.
It may easily be surmised in what direction Fitzgerald was
now spending what time he could spare from his literary
labours, and what money he could save from his steward-
ship, as he considered it, of Boat of Garry. At first he
accompanied Miss Chetwynd on one or two of her Eastern
expeditions with far more of curiosity and interest than of
hope; for it seemed to him, as it probably would to any
outsider, that to seek to alleviate the distress and misery of
this vast population with any such means as were at their
command, was about as sanguine as to try to drain an Irish
bog with a sponge. Moreover, it was not very picturesque
-as she had forewarned him. Very rarely was the
wretchedness tragic; it was merely mean and common-
place; existence in these foul-smelling lanes and desolate
grimy squares seemed a lack-lustre kind of thing; occasion-
ally the people were suspicious rather than grateful; and
always they misplaced their h's. But by-and-by, as time
went on, and as he saw further into the mechanism of the
various organisations, he could not help admiring the
patient heroism of those voluntary missionaries who, not
deterred by the vastness or the difficulties of the task,
busily and cheerfully set to work to do what they could;
and he began to see the appreciable fruit of their labours,
even if it were only a touch of light and colour added here
and there to those poor ignoble lives—a flower-box in a
window-sill; a drinking-fountain, perhaps; an exhibition of
pictures; a bit of green thrown open to the children, with

a swing or two. Then the free libraries, with books,
magazines, and newspapers ; cool in the summer, and well
warmed in the winter, with coffee at a penny a cup; and
the lectures and readings and entertainments, now putting
some inkling of sanitary requirements into the heads of the
grown-up people, again teaching the boys and lads some-
thing of the qualities that built up England; and the
invaluable district nurses, carrying notions of cleanliness
and kindliness into these poor homes; and so forth, and so
forth : all this busy, silent, unobtrusive work, not appealing
loudly for subscriptions, and not claiming for its authors
any title to martyrdom, seemed to him a very noble thing.
This sympathy quickly led to practical help. At the outset
he rather wished to act merely as assistant and safeguard
to the niece of his benefactress; but he soon found there
was no need for that. She had no fear; and there was
nothing to fear. In another way, however, he was of use
to her. Mary Chetwynd was very much at home in dealing
with “her poor people" as she called them, directly; and
she had an admirable self-possession on the platform,
whether she was demonstrating to an assemblage of men
and women the awful effects of drinking unfiltered London
water, or reciting patriotic poems to an audience of White-
chapel youths; but at the Council board of the Society she
was somewhat diffident. It very speedily appeared, how-
ever, that, when Mr. Fitzgerald was in course of time elected
to this board, the new member held very strong opinions
about the rights of minorities—especially when the minority
was Mary Chetwynd. Arguments and grumbling were alike
thrown away upon him. No, there he was; there he would
stay. And at last, upon the burning question of beer,
matters came to a final issue.
“Very well," said he, when he and Miss Chetwynd had
been entirely outvoted, “we need not quarrel. You may
go your way; but you can't hinder me from going mine.
As I said, I don't think a glass of ale can do any harm-if
not given to the boys; and I don't think it fair to ask these
men to come and spend a long evening without giving
them that small amount of indulgence. Now I mean to
try it- "

There was a kind of murmur of protest at this : was he
going to ignore such a solemn thing as a vote ?
“But you may have it either of two ways. Either I will
resign altogether, and be free to act that way; or I will
remain a member of the society, making any entertainments
I get up my own affair—at my own expense I mean-50
that for them the society will not be responsible. That
will take away the reproach of beer from you ; it will be
my doing alone.”
There was a little further grumbling; but the second
alternative was eventually chosen. They did not wish to
get rid of Fitzgerald altogether; for he was an active sort
of fellow; and he had time and money at his disposal ; and
they had seen how well he got on with the men and boys
at these meetings, keeping order in a good-humoured,
hectoring way. Besides they had had one or two newspaper
squabbles, and he had been found to be an efficient cham-
pion in that direction.
But when they got outside Mary Chetwynd said to him,
regarding him with eyes that seemed frightened and laughing
at the same time
“Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, what have you done?”
“Nothing dreadful, I hope," he said, with a smile.
“When you said 'I,' of course you meant 'we'?"
“Well, then?"
“ But how do you expect you and me to do all that by
ourselves? Think of the expense. Auntie will be furious.
She does not mind about me; but she says I am ruining
you; and that you are getting no pleasure in life- ".
“ Didn't I promise to go over to Boat of Garry in July ;
and you and she, I hope, will come over and stay there
too ?"
“And I have some remorse also,” she continued. “You
would never have raised the beer question, if I had not told
you about it in Ireland. Then that little Theatre costs
£8:1os. a night, without any beer. If I could pay for
everything, I should not mind Or if you would have a
hack and ride every day in the Park, as Mr. Scobell
suggests, then auntie would be more satisfied, and I should
be sure you had some kind of-of-

“But do I look so unhappy ?” he asked, with a laugh.
“However, your mention of Mr. Scobell is most opportune.
I think I ought to plunder Mr. Scobell-
“Oh no; after the filters- "
“But he has friends. At a dinner last year he told me
six of them then at the table were worth seven millions.
Now if we could get Mr. Scobell to squeeze them a little,
what would it matter about the — Theatre costing
£8: 1os. a night ?"
“You know best,” she said simply; "and I hope we
have not undertaken too much."
But indeed—whether he or she knew, or whether both
were ignorant-what interested him in that work down
there, and what was a constant delight to him, so that the
various pursuits or pleasures on which he might have spent
the very liberal income he enjoyed were not even to be
thought of, was the mere spectacle of herself in her relations
with these poor people. The beautiful, quiet serenity of
her nature seemed to shine there, amid all that turmoil of
want, and care, and ignorance, and crime. Wherever she
went peace surrounded her. Sickly and ailing women, in-
clined to succumb altogether to the hard pressure of fate,
drew strength from the self-reliant character of this mere
girl, and struggled on anew. Many a one of them told
Fitzgerald that none of the district-nurses could bring such
cheerfulness into a house as she could. He grew to think
of her what they thought of her. He heard their stories of
her; he saw her through their eyes—this King's daughter
with the outstretched hands, blessing and comforting wher-
ever she went.
“Willie,” said Mrs. Chetwynd to him, one evening
before the guests arrived for the table d'hôte, "why did you
not read to me that article in the Liberal Review about
benevolence-about the reaction of benevolence on one's
self — what was it called ?— Benevolence as an Invest-
ment?”
“I saw the article," said he, evasively.
“Yes; and you wrote it ?”.
“Why, how should you think that?” said he.
“ Because Mrs. Sims was here this afternoon; and she

read it to me; and both of us agreed that you had been
describing our Mary.”
“I-I hope you don't think there is anything that
would annoy—that would be too personal—if Miss Chet-
wynd were to see it?” he stammered.
“Well," said the bright little old lady, “considering that
you give her all the virtues of an angel, with half-a-dozen
other womanly ones, I don't think she ought to object.
And indeed, you know, although she is my niece, I must
admit that the portrait is recognisable.”
So the time passed ; and Mary Chetwynd was very
proud of the success of the new venture that Fitzgerald had
started (though whether that success was due to the merits
of the lecturer and the efficiency of her stage-manager and
bodyguard, or simply to beer, it would be unnecessary to
discuss), and there was no great difficulty about funds, after all.
Then Fitzgerald and Mrs. Chetwynd and her niece went
over to Boat of Garry in the July of that year; and John
Ross went with them, being commissioned to reproduce
one or two of his sepia sketches in oils; and they had a
pleasant stay there until the end of August. Altogether
their life, either there or here in London, was an un-
eventful one, full of cheerful activities and kindlinesses ;
and there seemed no reason why any one should wish it
changed.
But accidents happen. One evening, after they had
come back, Miss Chetwynd had arranged to have her fol-
lowing of youths and lads assemble in the little theatre
before referred to, to have displayed to them, by means of
a series of magic-lantern projections on a large screen, some
portraits of great Englishmen, with occasional remarks by
herself. Ordinarily, on such occasions, Fitzgerald was there
at the marshalling of the lads, ready with a good-natured
cuff, to preserve manners if need be; but the truth was
that, as long as “the lady” was present, they were very
well-behaved indeed. On this evening, however, there was
some serious business elsewhere about a poor wretch who
had purloined a book from one of the free libraries to buy
(as he said) a loaf of bread; and so Fitzgerald did not get
along to the theatre until the lecture, or entertainment, or

tever it mighter of the pineatre) and sat and famil
whatever it might be called, was well on its way. He
slipped into a corner of the pit (there were neither stalls,
gallery, nor boxes in this little theatre) and sat down.
The lecturess seemed very self-possessed and familiar
with her audience; talking to them as she selected this or
that slide ; and occasionally coming to the footlights to
address them directly.
“Now," she said, as she was stooping over the table, to
pick out the proper slide, “I suppose some of you read
Jones's Journal ?"
This was a wretched little local print, which did a good
deal of mischief down there. Her audience, perhaps
thinking that the portrait of the great Mr. Jones was about
to appear on the screen, stamped their feet a bit. On that
she rose erect, and faced them with some astonishment.
“Oh !” she said, “is that the kind of paper you admire ?
I hope not. I hope not, indeed! Perhaps some of you
think that when Mr. Jones is denouncing the Government,
and saying they have done this, that, and the other thing,
he could do it better himself? Would you like to see him
try? Is he likely to know more about governing a country
-is he likely to be more honest-than men who have been
educated all their lives for it, many of them very rich men
who, if they had chosen, might have spent all their time in
amusing themselves with horse-races or yachts, but who,
instead, go through an amount of labour and drudgery that
the hardest worked among you don't know anything about,
only to find themselves called swindlers and pickpockets
by gentlemen like Mr. Jones? Well, now, I know some-
thing that will enable you to judge of Mr. Jones. I know
that he has been twice before the magistrate for drunken-
ness and was fined each time; and I know there was an
execution in his office not very long ago ; and I put it to
you whether a man who manages his own affairs like that
would be likely to be able to manage the affairs of the
country ?”
This argument, though somewhat crude, and even verging
upon libel, was, at all events, easily understood.
“No-no!” was the general response.
“ Well, now, I am going to put before you the portrait

atursunday din down agarding ibo
of a great Conservative statesman, a most able and distin-
guished man. Perhaps I am not a Conservative inyself;
but that is neither here nor there ; I want you to believe
that the men who govern England on both sides in politics,
are trying to do their best; and that the man who tries to
stir up people to lawlessness and discontent is doing his
worst and making nothing but mischief. Don't you believe
that the rich have stolen the money they have; in most
cases it has been brought together by their fathers and
grandfathers being sober, industrious, and able men; and
when these people try to make good laws you ought to be
glad of it instead of howling at them as if they were tyrants.
It is the interest of everybody to preserve law and order.
Why, if it was not for law and order, how could your
mothers and sisters go along Whitechapel Road on a
Saturday night, looking at the shops, and buying things for
the Sunday dinner? It is the law that protects them from
being pushed down and their money taken from them.
And so far from regarding the police as your natural
enemies, or the enemies of anybody, you ought to think of
what Stepney or Whitechapel would be without them, and
you ought to be precious glad to lend them a helping hand
when you see a thief bolting, or when you see a band of
roughs coming along the pavement, hustling the women off
and annoying peaceable people.".
She put the selected slide into the magic-lantern; the
man in the “wings ” lowered the gas of the footlights, and
when the large, visionary, coloured figure of this Conserva-
tive statesman appeared on the screen, it was greeted (de-
spite all the tirades of Jones's Journal) with a murmur of
approval. But just at this moment something else hap-
pened. One amongst the audience, whose eyes had
wandered away from the large circle of light on the screen,
had noticed a flickering of another sort of light along the
edge of a portion of the curtain ; and thoughtlessly he
called out “Fire !” There was an instant of dead silence,
every one looking all around; and then, as the red light up
there attracted their eyes, there was a universal rush and
clamour. Fitzgerald jumped to his feet, and called to them
to sit down; but he might as well have called to the sea.


## p. 396 (#408) ############################################

There were no shrieks or screams, for there were no women
present; but a wild struggle to reach the doors, and a con-
sequent wedging up of the excited crowd. They could not
squeeze through. Then the black mass—or a great portion
of it—seemed to turn; frightened faces looked here, there,
everywhere; then the stage was charged. Fitzgerald caught
the first one that made by him ; and jammed him down
on to the form.
“Sit down, you fool; there is no danger !"
But he might as well have tried to put his hands on a
pack of wolves. They swarmed up and over on the stage;
seeing which Fitzgerald leapt up there too; shoved them
aside, and made for the spot where Miss Chetwynd was
standing, her face somewhat aghast. She was not regarding
the flames overhead; she was looking at the rushing crowd
that was now hurrying wildly towards the narrow passage
leading from behind the stage. He caught her hand-or
rather it was her wrist—and held it tight.
“Do not be afraid," said he, glancing up at the smoul-
dering curtain, and then at the disappearing people. “There
is no danger. They will all get out."
"I am not afraid, so long as you are by me,” she said,
in a rather proud kind of way.
He turned and looked at her eyes; and her eyes met
his.
“For always, then ?"
She did not speak; but she placed her hand over his
hand that held her wrist; and so they remained ; waiting
for the wild surging mass to get free away; while the red
light overhead grew more distinct.
It was a strange situation; but he seemed to have no
fear. He remembered afterwards that he was trying to
calculate how many more seconds it would take for the last
of the crowd to get through : also wondering when the fire-
men would arrive, and whether the theatre had been left
altogether without attendants; and at the same time watch-
ing quite calmly the progress of the flames. They did not
proceed rapidly. It was some little time before the wood-
work caught fire anywhere ; for at first it slowly blackened
and frizzled, as it were ; then a pale thin blue fire became

visible here and there along its surface; then a quicker
glow of crimson gleamed up.
“Shall we go now?” he said for the loud cries for
Dick, and Harry, and Jack, and Bill had grown fainter and
fainter.
“When you please," said she, with firm lips.
There was no trouble or danger about the matter. Just
as they were leaving, a loud splash and hissing was heard
overhead and a shower of heavy drops of water came over
the stage. They made their way along the “wings” and
out by the stage door; and found a large crowd assembled
in the street, kept back from the fire-engines by the police.
In ten or twelve minutes the whole affair was over; and it
only remained for Fitzgerald to get hold of the gasman
from among the crowd (the rascal had been among the first
to bolt) to have the gas turned off, so that there should be
no explosion; while, by the light of some candles, and with
the aid of a few of the boys, he got the magic-lantern
apparatus collected and carried to a four-wheeled cab out-
side, in which Mary Chetwynd was awaiting him.
When at last they had driven away from the dense
crowd that still lingered about the place there was a better
chance for speaking ; but silence seemed to be enough.
At length she said-
“You once offered me Boat of Garry. And now you
give your life to me. What next?”.
“It will become worth something when you take it," he
answered.

CHAPTER XXXYI.
IN A GALLERY.
which was plsover Galler.come to a
And now we must let a few years go by, and come to a
certain Private View day at the Bolsover Gallery, Hanover
Square. This Gallery, which was intended to be an adjunct
rather than a rival to the Royal Academy, had been opened
for the first time the year before, and had provoked a good
deal of animadversion, favourable and otherwise. For
while some declared (with more insistence than was at all
necessary) that its chief characteristic was an affected imi-
tation of the manner of the early Florentines, but with the
beauty and light and gladness of the old painters replaced
by a sickly languor and distortion and decay; that the
decorative character of the classical designs in nð wise
served as a cloak for obvious ignorance of anatomy and
consequent bad drawing of the human form; and that the
landscapes were less remarkable for a reverential study of
nature than for an impertinent audacity, there were others
who maintained (with a touch of personal injury in the tone
of their remonstrances) that this Bolsover Gallery collection
was a welcome relief from the inanity of the common run
of exhibitions ; that at all events it drove people to think ;
that a seeking after the highest in art, with whatever short-
comings, was better than the complacency of mediocrity;
that, in short, anything was desirable that could help to
get rid of the simpering curate sort of stuff that had for so
long told its commonplace and silly little stories on the
walls of British galleries. It needs only be added here
that among the most vehement of the admirers of this new

institution was John Ross. Whether dissatisfaction with
the Royal Academy's continued neglect of him may have
had anything to do with this feeling it is unnecessary to
enquire ; for human motives are mixed things; but at all
events his championship of the new Gallery was so uncom-
promising that Mrs. Chetwynd, who was always on the
look-out to do little kindnesses in this way, contrived a
meeting between Sir Cyril Smith, who was the Director of
the place, and the Scotch artist, which had, as it turned
out, sufficiently important results for one of them.
So on this summer-like day in spring there was a large
and fashionable assemblage circulating through the rooms,
or congregated in groups here and there, chatting, or re-
garding their neighbours' costumes, which, among the young
maidens at least, tended rather to sadness of hue and
quaintness of design. But there was one group there, of
which a tall, bright-eyed young lady was a conspicuous
member; and certainly her gown, if there was a suggestion
of mediævalism about the shape of it, was not lacking in
boldness and richness of colour. It was a velvet gown, of
the colour of the very darkest sort of wallflower-a deep
ruddy purple; and it was trimmed with lace, or what
appeared to be lace, of a dusky yellow—not the yellow of
primroses, but rather of daffodils. It was more the costume
of a young matron than of a girl ; but indeed when you
looked at this person, it was not her dress that first attracted
notice, but the grace and self-possession of her bearing, and
the bright, frank laugh of her eyes.
A tall, elderly, handsome man made his way through
the crowd to her.
“My dear child," said he, taking her hand, “I have
been hunting for you everywhere. I was told you had
come. And how well you are looking! And your dress,
too—they say it is the prettiest in the room. Very pretty
- very pretty!"
“But you need not praise me for it, Sir Cyril," said she,
“nor my dressmaker either. My husband chose the colours.
Was not that obedient of me? I told him I dressed only
to please him; and that he might as well choose what
colours he liked best. Was not that sweet of me?"

"Ah," said he, "young wives are always like that, at
first "
“Young wives, indeed! And my boy will be four years
old next June ! "
“And your boy will have very little to thank you for, if
you go catching another fever, and have to winter in Italy,
leaving the poor little fellow at home. Where is your
husband ?”
“Oh, he's away with John Ross somewhere-fighting,
no doubt. They're always fighting now—ever since we
came back from Italy "
“Have you been round the rooms yet?" he asked,
glancing at the little group of friends from whom he had
slightly separated her. She forthwith introduced him.
“No," she said. “It is a little too bewildering yet—to
me at least. All one's friends seem to be here; and it is
so difficult to remember all you want to say at the moment
that one has no time for the pictures. It is more exciting
than sitting on a terrace at Sorrento; or in a verandah at
Capri, watching the tourists climbing up the steps on the
donkeys. We went to Ischia after you left us. Now don't
stop talking to me, Sir Cyril ; for you have all your friends
to receive--"
“And the whole day to do it in," said he, lightly.
“No, but I am coming back to you. You must not go
away anywhere for lunch. I will come for you at one.
Mind you have got hold of your husband, and Mr. Ross;
there is something very nice and quiet prepared in a corner
-an invalid's luncheon, you know. Now go and get a
seat: don't stand about all day ; but indeed I never saw
you looking better in my life.”
He was going away, when he suddenly turned.
“ Bless my soul,” he exclaimed. “I was almost forget-
ting to ask how your aunt is—better, I hope ?”.
“Oh, I think so. I think she is almost quite better.
But she likes perfect rest, and seems disinclined for the
trouble of going out; she says she won't go with us to
Boat of Garry this year."
“But she is not ailing now?”.
“Oh no, scarcely at all; the warm weather suits her,
to see and then coming b. I wilt husband, ared in a com

and all she suffers from now, she says, is an incurable
laziness.”
“One o'clock, then, mind."
Almost immediately after Fitzgerald came hurrying along.
“ Have you heard ? Has any one told you ?” he said
eagerly.
“I have heard nothing in particular," she said, “but
why did you put on that shabby old shooting-coat ? Every
one else has a frock-coat; and gloves. Where are your
gloves ? This isn't Capri.”
“Every one says that Ross's pictures are the feature of the
exhibition,” he said, in the same rapid way, not in the least
minding her remarks about his clothes. “They have given
them the place of honour at the head of the next room-all
five in a row. Come along and see them. Gifford—”
Here he turned to Mr. Gifford, who, with his wife, a tall and
stately dame, was now examining some of the pictures close
by. "—Gifford, come and see some pictures in the next
room. I told you they would make their mark "
"Your friend Ross's, I suppose ?”
“ Yes. Come and judge for yourself. Mind you, I
mean to praise them, friend or no friend; so if you are
afraid of the reputation of the Liberal Review, you'll have
to get somebody else. Or we will appeal to an impartial
authority, if you like.”
No doubt Mr. Gifford, as the little party together made
their way up to the head of the next room, considered that
he himself was quite sufficient of an impartial authority;
and, as it turned out, he was much struck by the series of
landscapes. Or rather, there was only one landscape,
treated under five different atmospheric conditions. The
subject was the stretch of meadow, water, hill, and sky,
visible from the window of the dining-room at Boat of
Garry; the first showing the calm, clear dawn arising in
the east, the world being quite still and silent and lifeless;
in the second was all the variety of a windy summer day-
masses of white cloud and shadow, the trees blowing, the
work in the fields going on, and over at the horizon an
ominous rising of purple; then, in number three, a desola-
tion of rain, everything gray and blurred and hopeless;

number four showed the afternoon clearing up somewhat,
with a golden mist beginning to tell as the sunlight got
through the moisture; and, finally, the peace of a clear
moonlight night.
“A most excellent idea !” exclaimed Mr. Gifford, at
once. “Why, that is how one becomes familiar with a
place! Why has no one done that before? No one
wants any more variety than that-indeed, it shows all the
more what skill the artist has when he can do without fresh
materials. My dear fellow, you may praise those as much
as ever you like. They are the best things I have seen in
the exhibition yet, except your wife's portrait. Praise them
as you like ; I shan't interfere with you."
“But, you know,” Fitzgerald said, “there will be a
scrimmage amongst the critics, just as there was last year.
Now don't let the Liberal Review in for anything rash.
I'll tell you what I'll do; suppose we appeal ; suppose we
take the opinion of a thoroughly skilled artist ? "
“Not a bit. On that theory you would have me allow
poets to review other poets' poems; and novel-writers
to review other people's novels; and so on. Would that
be fair? We have set our faces against it since ever the
Liberal Review was started."
“And yet it seems to me the only opinion worth having,"
Fitzgerald ventured to say, “if you can make sure it is
without bias. Who can decide anything about any art
who has not shown that he has mastered its technicalities?
Surely the valuable opinion is that of a man who knows
the art; who is himself a proficient; and who is so far
above everybody else that jealousy or envy is out of the
question ”
“And do you expect the Liberal Review to pay men
like that
“Oh, I was not talking about writing at all,” Fitzgerald
said, with a laugh. “I was talking about these pictures.
Now I would take the opinion of Sydenham before any
other. He is far beyond rivalry; he can paint landscape
just as well as portraits, and nobody can come near
him in either-
“ He is too good-natured; he finds good in everything,”

Mr. Gifford objected. “I have walked round the Academy
with Sydenham. Not a word of objection anywhere;
always the best points picked out; the difficulties explained
to you; always praise, especially if the picture is by one of
the younger men; always encouragement — very good-
natured; but not criticism. No; I propose that if there
is to be any appeal, it will be to your wife, for she knows
the place. Mrs. Fitzgerald, we want your opinion of Mr.
Ross's landscapes.”
“Oh, don't ask me," said the tall young lady in the wall-
flower and daffodil gown; “I want to buy them, and can't
afford it."
“Well, that is an honest criticism,” Mr. Gifford said. “I
think, Fitzgerald, you may let the Liberal Review speak well
of the Boat of Garry studies. But where is Ross himself?”
“He won't come into this room. He says it is like
having himself put into a frame, and people examining him
with a microscope.”
But now they had to set to work to go through the
galleries systematically and seriously, though that was
often interrupted by the arrival of a fresh batch of
friends who were all of them anxious to see the portrait of
Mary Chetwynd (as some of them still called her) which had
been painted by Mr. Sydenham, and which was supposed
to be the chief ornament of one of the rooms. They
were joined by Mr. Ross, moreover, whose remarks, if some-
what disjointed and dogmatic, were generally to the point.
“ That fellow ?” he said, regarding the work of an
artist who had obviously spent an enormous amount of
care in constructing an allegory (but the conundrum was
difficult of solụtion until you turned to the title in the
catalogue). “That fellow? Look at the thrawn necks;
look at the sham sentiment! That fellow ? he would get
painted tin flowers to put on his mother's grave. There,”
said he, turning to the full-length portrait of Fitzgerald's
wife that hung in the middle of the room. “Look at
that now. That is painted by a man who knows that it
is his business to paint, and no to bother his head with
the twelfth century or the fifteenth century or any other.
Long ago he shook off the corpse cloths; you canna bind

a giant in spider-webs. There's just nothing that man can-
not paint : put it before him-a young lady's face, a bit of
moorland, a collie dog—no matter what it is—put it be-
fore him, and then you find the master-hand getting it on
to the canvas with a power and a carelessness that has
grown out o' the anxiety and hard work of a lifetime—the
details that tell in, the details that are of no use out.
Look at that fan for colour now—the sharp line in the dusk
of the dress. Look at the eyes : they're no saying "What
do you think of me? Am I looking my best? Am I
standing right?' They're saying 'Here I am. I am in
the world as well as you. I could speak to you if I liked.'
People think he is careless; I say that he is careless about
what is non-essential; but many a hard struggle it took him
to find out that. Would they like him to labour the thing,
so they could count the pins in the pin-cushion? "
“My dear Mrs. Fitzgerald,” said a voice behind them,
"I must really beg and entreat of you to come away.”
They turned and found before them Mr. Sydenham
himself, and also his pretty wife, whom Fitzgerald had in
bygone days endeavoured to bribe with sandwiches.
“Is it fair?" said he. “Is it the act of a Christian
woman to stand opposite my paint, and show people the
difference? And you just back from Italy, too, with the
Neapolitan sun on your cheeks ?"
“I was listening to a lecture, Mr. Sydenham,” said she.
“Mr. Ross was delivering a lecture; and you would have
been pleased if you had heard."
"Is it to be claw me, and I'll claw thee,' then?”
said the famous Academician, with a good-natured smile.
“There's nothing in these rooms to beat your fine Irish
sketches, Mr. Ross.”
“It's no a claw I want from ye, sir," said John Ross,
grimly. “It's a "scratch,' when some decent fellow some
day puts me up for an Associate. It is what everybody
looks for, I suppose ; though I jalouse there'll be more
gray nor red in my beard by that time."
“You shall have my 'scratch' and welcome; and I hope
long before then," said the Academician; and then again

bourhood of her portrait, which she was not loth to do, for
she was very hungry, she said, and one o'clock had arrived.
Presently Sir Cyril Smith appeared and carried the party
off in a body-John Ross alone seeming shy or reluctant,
But he was very soon put into a pleasant humour by his
neighbour at table, who happened to be Mrs. Sydenham,
who said she imagined he must be the friend on whose behalf
Fitzgerald had endeavoured to bribe her with sandwiches.
“That was no use," said he, bluntly.
“No, I should think not," said this pretty woman, with
a charming smile. “I should think not indeed. Not
sandwiches. At my time of life one knows better than to
eat sandwiches-
"I wasna thinking of that, mum,” said Ross, “I was
thinking your husband ought not to be bothered with any
such things. A man that can paint as he can paint should
have nothing in the world to interfere with his time or
attention; if he wastes a day, the country loses just so
much- "
“Oh, but he takes great interest in the younger men.
And I am very glad he thinks so highly of your pictures-
it was not to you alone he said that; and—and, of course,
you must be proud of the place they have got- "
“Oh ay,” he said, “the tod will find a hole some-
where "
“I beg your pardon ?"
But as he did not answer—or did not hear-she went
on to say that she understood he was again going to Ireland
with the Fitzgeralds; and they were going early this year,
were they not?-and had he been allowed to see anything
of the volume of poems—or poetical dramas—that Mr.
Fitzgerald was understood to have finished in Italy, and
that was now on the eve of publication? John Ross
answered as best he could ; but he was getting rather dis-
contented; for there was nothing to drink at this needlessly
sumptuous repast but thin cold wine. At last, however, he
said to the servant who was in vain tempting him with
various decanters
“I say, my man, could you get me a wee drappie o'
whisky ?"

“Yes, sir; certainly, sir."
And after that Mr. Ross proved a far more pleasant
companion ; and gave Mrs. Sydenham such a picture of
the life at Boat of Garry, and such graphic accounts of the
exploits of himself and his friends there, that she said that
nothing but his description of the demon steam-yacht
deterred her from begging for an invitation there and then.
After luncheon there was a movement to return to the
pictures; and Fitzgerald seized the opportunity to bid them
good-day.
“ Where are you off to now?” his wife asked.
“I want to overhaul one or two of the libraries, if there's
time before dinner.”
“Let me go with you."
“In that dress? You would be a pretty spectacle in
Shoreditch."
“I could remain in the hansom."
“Get away with you. You are off duty; you are a
helpless invalid—though you don't look it. Stay with Mrs.
Sydenham, and see your friends. My shooting-coat isn't
swell enough for that.”
“Very well,” she said. “When shall you be home?"
“At a quarter to seven, whatever happens. I leſt word
there would be an enormous table d'hôte; so you can seize
hold of all the nice people. Don't forget John Ross; don't
lose sight of him. We will make John Ross the occasion;
and we will get him to make a speech."
“ You will do nothing of the kind; I won't have anybody
tortured. Shall I ask the Giffords ?"
6 Yes."
" And the Sydenhams ?"
“If they have not had enough of us to-day already.
Ask anybody you like, who happens to be disengaged. It
is John Ross's day; let him have a triumph in the evening."
And in a couple of minutes thereafter he was in a
hansom making for Commercial Road East, and striving
to extract a few items of intelligence from that morning's
newspaper, which he had not before had time to glance
over.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
AT INISHEEN.
about eight, which are beind, with large, colthy - looki
And again we will let a few more years go by, bringing us
to quite the other day, in fact. At the window of a room
in the Imperial Hotel at Inisheen a small boy, apparently
about eight or nine, is standing, regarding the carriage and
pair below, which are being led off to the stable-yard. He
is a good-looking little lad, with large, soft, pensive eyes, a
square forehead, and curly hair-a healthy-looking little,
chap, too, though one foot is off the ground, and he is
supporting himself with a stick. To him enters his father.
.“Well, Master Frank, shall you be able to amuse your-
self while I go out for a stroll? You see what comes of
climbing after wood-pigeons' nests.”
“A good job, too,” remarked the small boy, with
complacency.
“What is ? Spraining your ankle ?"
“Yes. You wouldn't have brought me with you if it
hadn't been for that, papa. Mamma said you were very busy.
And I wasn't to interfere with you. I was to take great care
not to be a trouble to you, she said, for you liked to be
alone when you were finishing a book, and I wasn't to
mind if you left me by myself. And I don't mind a bit.”
He glanced round the room.
“And is this really the inn that your papa kept ?”
“ Yes, it is ; perhaps you don't think much of it?"
“Well,” said the small boy, with delicacy, not wishing to
wound his father's feelings, “it isn't very swell, is it?"
“When I was a boy, my lad, it was the only hotel in

Inisheen, and it was regarded as a place of importance.
See, here are your books. You'd better sit down for a
while and give your foot a rest.”
“I like the stories you tell better than those in the
books," remarked Master Frank, regarding the volumes
with anything but favour, “only mamma says I ought never
to believe them.”
“Which, though ?"
“The stories you tell. Mamma says you are always
making a fool of people. Was it true, papa, about the man
who went to India ?”.
“Really there are so many people go to India that I
have forgotten."
“But the man who went out to India ; and he pretended
to have a sun-stroke ; and then, when he came back, he
was allowed to do anything he liked, for his friends were
afraid of bringing it on again, and the police always let him
off, because he had been mad; and he lived such a merry
life. Was that true, papa ?"
“Well, if it had not happened, how would people have
known anything about it?" was the evasive reply. “Now
take a book; and put your foot up on a chair ; while I go
and see if there's anybody in the place I know now. I
don't suppose there will be since Andy the Hopper-do
you remember the sketch of him that Mr. Ross made for
you one night ? "
“ Oh yes, papa.”
“Well, he is away at Tramore now, they say; and I doubt
whether there is a human being I know now in the town.”
And yet, when he went out into the sunlight this older
part of Inisheen did not seem to have changed much
during the last seven years. If there was any difference, it
lay rather between the Inisheen that he was accustomed to
dream about and this present, everyday, rather common-
place Inisheen. This was the second time he had visited
the little town since finally he had left it for London; and
on each occasion the same rectification had to be made.
Yes; there were the quiet, respectable-looking houses, and
the shops, and the town-hall; the wharves and quays, with
țar-barrels, and coals; the barques and brigantines stranded

on the mud; and the broad waters of the bay; and the sunny
green of the hills beyond. To get a wider view he climbed
up the face of the steep slope on which the town is partly
built; there were cottages here and there apparently
clinging hazardously to the ascent; fragments of old
ruins cropping up; cocks and hens fluttering among the
dust or hiding among the nettles ; children clambering over
walls topped with marjoram; and an old gentleman, in a
jacket without sleeves, fast asleep in a damp and shady
angle of a garden wall which was profuse with moss and
hart's-tongue fern. Then he came to the enclosures round
the houses of the richer people—on the summit of the hill,
amid gardens and lush meadows; and from this height he
could look down on the picturesque little harbour; and the
rippling green waters of the bay; and the wide sandbanks
left exposed by the tide; and also on the far expanse of sea
pale and blue in the hazy sunlight, with one or two dots of
ships apparently making slowly in for the tiny port before a
gentle southerly breeze.
He felt so much of a stranger here. No doubt, if he were
to go through the shops down there he might discover this one
or that who would perhaps recognise Master Willie; and no
doubt, if he were away up over the hills there (“the moun-
tain" they called them) he could find a cabin or two where
he would be welcomed by some aguish old crone, with
many a “Glory be to God !" But of his old intimates, as
he had learned from time to time, there was scarcely one
left. His father had died many years before. Why, even
the Cork Chronicle, which the Inisheen people used to take
in chiefly because Master Willie put his poetry about
Inisheen, and his songs and palaverings about the Inisheen
girls, into it, existed no longer. When he drove up to the
Imperial, the very ostler who took the horses had never
heard of the Fitzgeralds who once had the place. And yet,
as he looked at the quays and the houses and the harbour
Inisheen did not seem to have changed so much. It was
he who was changed; and something else—was it his youth?
or a remembrance of his youth that, whether he thought of
it or not, was always haunting him, and making Inisheen
look strange ?—seemed now far away.

He wandered down from this height, thinking he would
go and have a look at the newer Inisheen that faced the
sea. As he was walking along the main thoroughfare of
the older town-perhaps not noticing much—and passing
one of the side streets leading to the quays, he heard an
exclamation behind him-
“The Lord be marciful to us.”
He turned instantly and recognised old Molly, who for
innumerable years had sold nuts and apples and oranges to
the boys of Inisheen. The old woman struggled up from
the barrel on which she was sitting-
“Och, God help us all, 'tis yoursilf, Masther Willie !" she
said, and she seized his hand with her long skinny fingers.
“Och, 'tis the great gintleman you are now, wid your horses
and your carriages riding through the town. Shure I
thought 'twas yoursilf, Masther Willie ; and then I thought
'twas nansinse ; and sure you're come to take the place
your father had before ye—his sowl's in glory, amin !-oh,
wirasthrue, but me back is broke wid the cowld nights-and
yer honour's coming back to the Impayrial now-and you'll
have a good word for ould Molly wid the sarvints "
He had to explain to the ancient Molly—whose aspect,
by the way, would have been more venerable had her gray
hair been less dishevelled and had she worn a dress more
appropriate to her age and sex than an old soldier's jacket,
the scarlet of which had got sadly faded through exposure
to wind and weather—that he had no intention of re-
establishing the Fitzgeralds in the Imperial Hotel; and
then he presented her with all the silver he could find in
his pockets and passed on.
How often he had walked along this very road, in the
far bygone days, with the eager ambitions and wild desires
of youth busy with the future! And now that he had
attained to almost everything he had dreamed of-in certain
directions to far more than ever he had dreamed of_to
what did it all amount? Well, he had made many friends,
known and unknown; and that was pleasant; and he strove
to remain on kindly terms with them; and to do what little
he could, in the way of writing, if that might be of any
service to them, in as thorough and honest a fashion as was

possible. But so far as he could see, there was not any-
thing in life much better than showing a picture-book to a
sick child, or some such simple act of benevolence or
charity; and in this respect he had entirely adopted the
views of his wife. Neither he nor she was concerned about
the motives that might be imputed to them. If it was a
luxury, they could afford it. If it was self-gratification, at
least it did not harm others. If it was outraging the
principles of political economy, the principles of political
economy would have to look out for themselves. In short,
both he and she, as it turned out, found themselves with so
many things to do that they really had no time to sit down
and construct analyses of the Moral Faculty.
This modern Inisheen out-fronting the sea was more
changed than the older part of the town, for a number of
new-looking villas had been added_most likely the summer
residences of the Cork people. But it was pleasanter for
him to turn his back on these, and find before him the old
familiar ocean-picture; the spacious view that he was in
the habit of conjuring up before his mental vision whenever
he wanted to introduce a sense of light and width-and
perhaps a touch of solitariness ?—into his writing. Solitary
enough it was. Nothing but the level miles of pale brown
sand; and the vast extent of glassy, pale blue sea; and
between these the long thin lines of the ripples that came
in and in, darkening in shadow, until suddenly there was a
gleam of silver, sharp as the edge of a knife, and then a
curling over of white foam sparkling in the sun, and the
protracted “hs—S5—ss” as the wave broke along the shore.
A pale and placid picture; perhaps a trifle sad also; for
with such a faint and fair background, the mind is apt to
set to work to put in figures and these would be walking
along the sand, naturally; and they might be young; and
dreaming dreams.
Then he recollected the poor chap with the sprained
ankle; and so he turned and walked leisurely back to the
hotel; discovering, when he got there, that Master Frank
had been engaged the while in carving his name, in bold
letters, on one of the window-shutters.
“When I grow up, papa," said he, contemplating this

tentative effort at immortality, “I hope I shall be famous
like you.”
“Who told you I was famous ?” his father said, with a
laugh.
“Mamma. I wish I could get such nice letters from
people you don't know; from America, and Canada, and
as far away as where Robinson Crusoe lived. Sometimes
mamma reads them to me. What did you do to make the
Queen call you 'well-beloved '?”
“What nonsense has got into your head now?”.
“No, it is not,” said Master Frank, pertinaciously.
“Mamma read it out of a big book. The Queen said you
were 'trusty and well-beloved.""
“Oh, that is nothing. Don't you know, when the
Queen appoints you a Royal Commissioner to enquire into
anything, that is the phrase she uses. I suppose your
mamma had got hold of that Blue-book "
“But the Queen would not say so unless she meant it.
She doesn't tell lies, does she?"
“Why, of course not. Well, Master Frank, until you
are older we will postpone the subject, and in the meantime
we will have some tea. I suppose you are aware that you
may have late dinner with me to-night ?"
" Just as you please, papa. Mamma said I was not to
trouble you— "
“And you have remembered your lesson very well. In
consideration of which I will tell you a story--"
“Oh, will you ?"- and immediately the small lad
hobbled across from the window to his father's knee,
looking up with his big girlish-looking eyes full of expect-
ation. For the stories his papa told were far more
wonderful than anything to be found in books.
“ Not only that—but it is a story of a bull !"
“A very wild one?".
“ A fearfully wild one."
There was a sort of sigh of delight.
“Well, this bull used to roam about just behind this
very town of Inisheen; and it is very open there-plenty
of bog-land—and he could see you from a great distance;
and he'd come stalking along the road, right in the middle,

and allow no one to pass. And he was especially savage
with boys; and you wouldn't believe the roundabout ways
we had to take-"
“Oh, were you one of them, papa ?”
“I was alive then," the story-teller continued, evasively,
“and I may have looked on and seen what the other boys
did. But the terrible business about this beast was that
he could hop over a wall with the greatest ease; and it
was no use shutting a gate on him, if he meant to be after
you. He was a terror to the whole district-especially to
the boys; and we used to get angry-I mean, they used to
get angry, and wonder what they would do to the bull if
only they could get the chance. Then at last one of us-
one of them hit on a plan. They went carefully along the
road and picked out a place where the bog came close up,
and where there were just two or three clumps of moss so
that you could cross over if you went lightly and watched
your footing. Of course you remember what Bruce did at
Bannockburn ".
“He dug pits and covered them over--"
“Precisely. Well, then, this was a sort of ambuscade
like that. I don't think ambuscade is the right word; but
it's good enough for a bull. Well, then, the next thing the
boys did
“But you were one of them, papa ?"
“I might be looking on. I might have gone round by
the bog that day. At all events they went to a person
called Andy the Hopper that I've often told you about;
and Andy was a curious-minded creature, who always liked
to have red sleeves when he could afford it to his jacket;
and they got the loan of an old jacket with the red sleeves;
and they spread that out on two sticks; and away they
went along the road. And there, sure enough, was the bull.
He didn't say anything; he only looked. Then they went
on, cautiously ; until they were within a certain distance;
and there they stopped. The bull didn't move. Then
they began to retreat a little—and you must know, Master
Frank, that a bull always understands that as an invitation
for him to come and chivy you. The bull came on a bit ;
stopped for a second; then gave a loud bellow; and then

came on faster. This was precisely what those wicked
boys wanted. For now they turned and took to their
heels; and the bull came careering after them; and then,
at the spot they had marked, they left the road, and went
hopping across the bog, that was very wet at that time, for
there had been much rain. Very well, then, you see, when
the bull came tearing along, he had no notion of a strategy
or an ambuscade or anything of that kind; and he did not
stop to consider that he was far heavier than a boy; and
that his sharp hard feet would sink where theirs would just
touch the little dry clumps; and so in he went with a
splash and a struggle—and another splash and a struggle
—and another splash and another struggle—always getting
deeper and deeper into the thick black mud, and bellowing
and roaring with rage. You never saw anything like it.
Mind you, when we stopped and looked, I won't say we
weren't a little bit frightened; for if one of his fore-legs had
got hold of a piece of good solid ground, we might have
had another run for it, and he'd have knocked the whole
town to smithereens before he'd have stopped. After a
long time, however, he gave it up. He found his struggles
useless; and when he bellowed it wasn't Wait till I catch
you,' it was 'Who's going to get me out?'-- "
“Papa," said Master Frank, thoughtfully, “could you
have got near him then ?".
“Oh yes, I daresay. He was stuck fast."
“You could have got near him in safety pº
“Oh yes, I think so," answered the father, not doubting
that the boy, who had been taught to be kind to all animals,
had imagined some way of getting the poor bull out of his
troubles.
“Then didn't you get a big stick and beat him over the
head ?" said Master Frank, eagerly..
“Well, no," said the papa, a little disappointed. “But
I'll tell you what happened it took nearly half the people
of Inisheen to get that bull out; for they were all afraid to
go and fasten the ropes; and when it did get on to dry
land again it seemed anxious to reduce the population of
the neighbourhood. I don't think I saw that," the narrator
added, demurely.

" You didn't wait to see it hauled out ?” said Master
Frank, with staring eyes.
“No, you see, Frankie, there were a lot of wicked boys
about the place; and the people suspected they had in-
veigled the bull into the bog; and supposing I had been
about just at that time-looking on, you know-well, they
might have thought I had had a hand in it, and one might
have got into trouble. It's always the best plan to keep
away when you see a scrimmage going on. The most
innocent people are sometimes suspected. Never you go
near crowds."
Master Frank thought over this story for some time;
and then he said, in an absent kind of way-
“I believe it was you yourself, papa, that teased the
bull into the bog."
They had late dinner together in the evening, and no
doubt it was that circumstance that provoked Master Frank
into unusual animation and talkativeness, in the course of
which he unlocked many a dark and secret cupboard of his
mind, where he had stored away subjects or remarks for
subsequent examination. He startled his father, for ex-
ample, by suddenly, and à propos of nothing, asking him
how it was possible for a man to have three godmothers.
“I don't know what you mean !” his father said.
“Why, don't you remember, papa, the organ-grinder
coming to Hyde Park Gardens, and playing 'The Last
Rose of Summer '?”.
“No, I don't recollect that remarkable circumstance.
I suppose he didn't remain very long ?”.
“But don't you remember you asked mamma what sort
of a man he could have been who first twisted the air
about with variations; and then you began and told me
all that you hoped had happened to him when he was
alive ?"
“Well, I don't remember that either."
“And you said you hoped he had three godmothers,
and never knew what his name was, because they kept
bothering him- "
“I am not quite sure ; but I think we must have been
talking nonsense, Frankie.”

“ And mamma said you had invented enough evil things
for him, and you might turn to the men who were cutting
the tails off cattle and shooting at people here in Ireland.”
“The less you say about that the better, Master Frank;
for in this part of the country walls have ears.”
"I know,” said Master Frank, confidently, “that mamma
will be very glad when you have done with the fishing, and
we all go back to England again
“Nonsense!”
“But I heard her say so, papa !"
"She was having a little joke with you, Master Frank.

“I know mamma does not like you to go away fishing
by yourself,” said Master Frank, doggedly.
“But do I ever go away fishing by myself—or did I
ever go away fishing by myself until you must needs set
about spraining your ankle? And supposing there were
any of these rascals about Boat of Garry, which there are
not; and supposing they were coming stealing along on
tiptoe when I wasn't watching; and supposing you were
standing by with a gaff in your hand, and a gaff with remark-
ably sharp steel point, what then? What would you do?
You can lay hold of a salmon or a sea-trout smartly enough.
Could you catch one of Captain Moonlight's men by the
ear ?"
The boy did not answer that, for he was evidently
considering something with much care. At last he said,
meditatively,
“I wish you were the king, papa, and then you would
show the rascals something."
“But how? What should I do?".
“ Kill the whole lot," was the prompt answer.
“Well, that would teach them a lesson, wouldn't it !"
Dinner over, Fitzgerald drew in his chair to the fire-
more by custom than for warmth, for the night was mild-
and lit a cigar, and proceeded to look over a newspaper.

hion, he hat could twist - refuge in boord minds.
This last performance was a sore trial for the patience of
Master Frank, who doubtless considered that it would have
been much more sensible to devote the time to a discussion
of the affairs of the country between two congenial minds.
As for himself, he scorned to seek refuge in books. Not
having two legs that could twist about the chairs in his
usual fashion, he put the one at his disposal into every
conceivable attitude, until he nearly succeeded in tilting
the table over with his foot; then he tied a bit of string to a
teaspoon, and twitched, to see if it would spin like a spoon-
bait; then he got out his pocket-knife and slowly and
carefully sharpened the edge on the boards of a book,
finishing up by carving his initials thereon, just to try the
point, as it were ; and then, as time went on, he grew
suspicious.
“Papa," said he, "you are not going out, are you ?"-
for, indeed, Fitzgerald had once or twice gone to the win-
dow and glanced outside.
“If I do,” his father said, “it won't make any difference.
It will soon be time for you to be off to bed. I may go
out; but I shall not be long; and you will be sound
asleep."
Nothing more was said for a while; Master Frank being
engaged in drawing a portrait of Balbus on the title-page of
his Latin Grammar. Then he said-
"Is it a beautiful night, papa ?"
“ Oh yes.”
Then again-
"Is it a very beautiful night, papa ?”
“ The moon must be getting higher now," his father said,
going to the window, and pushing the blind aside. “Oh
yes, it is a fine enough night.”
The boy got hold of his stick and hobbled across the room.
“Let me look, papa. Oh, isn't it a beautiful night!
What a pity it is we can't see the sea."
“Frank,” said his father, putting his hand on the boy's
head, “would you like to go with me?"
He looked up with a bright, eager look of assent and
gladness; but instantly—with a great deal of bravery–he
shook his head.

“I promised mamma not to bother you," he said
slowly. “And—and besides, papa, I can't walk."
He hung down his head a little, to hide the tears of
disappointment that would rise to his eyes. His father was
looking out of the window, and did not notice. But
presently he said —
“Poor chap, you've had rather a dull afternoon. Look
here, Frankie, I'll tell you what we'll do—as sure as ever
was. The horses have done almost nothing to-day ; sup-
posing we were to get the carriage round? What do you
say to that? We'll go for a drive, my lad ; and then you'll
not only see the sea in moonlight, but the bay also,
and a wooded glen I was going to. What do you say to
that. Manne but it immense
“Mamma won't be angry- ” suggested Master Frank,
doubtfully—but it was clear from his face that he regarded
the proposal with immense delight.
“We will buy her something, Frankie, to pacify her,
when we get back to Bantry. Now you go and sit down;
and I will get hold of Murtough ; and as soon as we can
we'll have the carriage ready for you. But I can tell you,
my lad, that wasn't how I was treated when I was a boy-
there were no late dinners for me, or a carriage to take me
out for a drive in the moonlight. I really don't know what
this generation is coming to.”
“But papa, if you could have got it, you would have
taken it?" said the boy, looking up.
“That's neither. here nor there," his father said, as he
put on his hat and coat. “That's neither here nor there.
What I say is that boys nowadays are spoiled ; and especially
boys that are allowed to come to Boat of Garry when they
ought to be at their school at Campden Hill; and still
more especially boys whose mothers buy for thein a twelve-
foot trout-rod before they've even got the length of omnis
Gallia. Now don't you attempt to go down those stairs
till I come and fetch you."
Fitzgerald seemed in the lightest and pleasantest of
humours when finally he and his small boy had got them-
selves ensconced in the open landau, with an abundance of
rugs over their knees. He had, indeed, been loth to leave

the little chap for a second time that day, even though it
was not very far from his bed-time; and he was glad to
give him this unexpected trip as some compensation for the
dulness of the afternoon. Moreover the night was fine.
The air was mild ; the skies clear; Inisheen and its wide,
still waters looked quite picturesque in the moonlight.
“ And what would you say now, Master Frank,” his
papa asked, as they drove out from the town into the
silence of the country, “if I were to tell you that I had a
tryst with the fairies in the wooded glen I told you about ?”
The boy looked up; he seldom knew whether his father
was joking or in earnest.
“I did not think there were any fairies nowadays,” was
the answer.
“Well,” his father continued, “if you ever make a tryst
with Don Fierna and his little people to come and visit
them once in every seven years, you will find it more and
more difficult, as you grow older and older, to listen hard
enough to hear them coming, and to look hard enough to
see the sides of the glen opening and the long procession
appearing. When you are young perhaps it is a little easier.
Do you remember how they stole away Burd Helen into
Elfinland ?"
“Oh yes. You told me about that.”
“Then you remember that Childe Rowland was the
youngest of all her brothers. Do you think any of the
older ones could ever have found out the dark tower, no
matter how Merlin helped them? If Childe Rowland
had not had the eyes of youth, he never would have
found his way; and I believe Burd Helen would have
been in the dark tower still.”
"I have never seen any," was the small lad's practical
remark.
“Well, that is strange. But in any case you won't
mind waiting a little while in the carriage, when we get to
the glen, and I will go down by myself, and if I hear or
see anything I will come back and tell you."
“Oh, but I know better than that, papa," said the boy,
shrewdly. “ You are not going to look for any fairies.
When you go away by yourself, it is to watch rabbits and

other things, and write about them. I know very well.
Whenever mamma sees you go out alone, without your
fishing-rod, she always calls us back."
“Oh, indeed. But then, you see, Frankie, you were
never at Inisheen before; and strange things used to
happen about here, many years ago, when I was young ;
and I don't know what may not be seen in that glen. So
you will remain in the carriage for a while, when we get
there; and if I spy out the fairies down in the hollow, with
their glow-worm lamps, you know, I shan't say a single
word to them, but I'll come back to the road at once and
whistle for you. Do you understand ?”
“That's all nonsense, papa. I don't believe there are
any."
“Wait and see."
At length they arrived at a portion of the road that was
shadowed over by a double row of elm-trees; and here
Fitzgerald called on Murtough to stop; and got out,
leaving Master Frank in the carriage.
“Now, you listen, Frankie," said he, “and when I
whistle make ready,
“I could not go down into that glen with my sprained
ankle, papa," the boy said.
“ People never know," said he, as he went up and over
the little bank by the roadside, “what they can do when
they see fairies coming along. It is quite an event in one's
life."
Indeed, it was with no great heaviness of heart, no very
acute anguish of remembrance, that he now, for the second
time, and in middle age—that is to say at seven-and-thirty
-went to keep the tryst he had made at three-and-twenty.
It was with a brisk enough step that he crossed the open
glade, and then more cautiously made his way down the
steep bank, through the brushwood, until once more he
stood by the little scooped-out hollow in the rock, into
which the water fell with a continuous murmur. The
place was quite unaltered. It might have been yesterday
that he and Kitty had stood there, with their hands clasped,
before he rowed her away back to Inisheen. It might have
been yesterday that he had gone back to the place only to

find himself standing there alone; conjuring up phantoms,
and not then quite so reconciled to the fate that had
befallen him.
Yes; that former visit, seven years before, had been a
sharper thing. It seemed to him that then, for the first
time, he had realised what this separation meant. Our
other griefs and miseries over the loss of our loved ones
who go away from us through the sad portal of death, keen
as they may be, are in time solaced by a wistful hope of
reunion. What is that but a temporary separation, if they
are awaiting us yonder, with light on their faces ? But this
separation from one who, as we think, is to be linked with
us through this brief life, and in death, and in the farther
life beyond—that seemed to him the true separation; and
the breaking down of faith; and a hopelessness for ever
and ever. Something of the old misery had come back on
him ; the old pain had stirred again at his heart; the
quick, sudden agony of the discovery of her falsehood had
throbbed again, even after these years. It was so strange
-his standing here on one side ; on the other a vacant
space, a voiceless air, a darkness where the light of her eyes
ought to have been. That night was one not easily to be
forgotten.
But now, seven years later, all that was over for the
most part; and he sought out a bit of rock which afforded
him a kind of seat; and sat down and listened to the
monotonous gurgling and rushing of the water. He was
scarcely sorry now that all that had happened in the olden
time. It was a kind of pretty picture, mostly. Or rather
it was a kind of well of romance and sentiment that he
could dip into when he pleased, for literary purposes.
Nay, to tell the truth, had not this very journey been
partly undertaken with some such purpose? It was like
renewing one's youth, to get into this realm of imagination
again. That may have been the moral of his remarks to
Master Frank about the increasing difficulty of finding out
where the fairies were.
And yet, while he was thus convincing himself that he
was a highly matter-of-fact person; and striving to regard
that episode in his youthful life as something apart from

him; and inclined to wonder what influence on his writing
these occurrences and despairs and all the rest of it may
have had ; some foolish fondness for the bygone days stole
over him; and he would have been glad to know that
Kitty was well, and looking pretty, and enjoying content.
He had heard of her once or twice, but in the vaguest way.
He did not know where she was living now. And indeed
the only regret that possessed him at this moment was
about the final portion of that vow that he and she had
taken together. Why should there have been any hatred
or revenge in these promises made by two young people
who could know so little of what was before them? Kitty
herself had begged of him to make it a love night. He
remembered the imploring look of her eyes; the very tone
of her voice (and how sweet and soft and musical that
was !) “Oh, Willie, not that,” she had said, “ let this be a
love night /" Did he wish “grief to be a guest in her house,
and sorrow to dwell in her house, for ever"? Surely not.
Kitty had made his life very beautiful for a time.
Supposing that he had never met her at all—in these early
years ? Could he ever have understood quite so well that
nameless witchery that makes so much of the wonder and
joy of human existence and is the cause of so much of its
misery ? Could he have known quite so intimately what
all the poets have been talking about, since ever Helen
came to Ilion's towers—with “her young eyes still wound-
ing where they looked ”. He never would have known
how keen the blue of the speedwell was, had not she and he
together found it on those far uplands, that now seemed to
him as if they must have been very near the sky, so clear
and vivid was the light over them. Poor Kitty! Did she
ever sing now “Then farewell, but whenever you welcome
the hour”? Had she ever come to Cork again; and
climbed up to Audley Place; and thought of the old days?
There was no reason why she should not have made such
a pilgrimage; her husband was well off ; Kitty would have
a maid of her own now; and she used rather to like travel-
ling about.
The night was just as still as that on which he and
Kitty had come there ; there was not a breath of wind

stirring the bushes overhead; the only sound was the
prattling of the streamlet in the silence.
"It sounds like laughing," he was thinking. “Perhaps
it has listened to all the nonsense that has been talked by
the different lovers who have come here; and it may
have understood all the time; and gone on chuckling. It
does sound as if it was laughing. To think of all the
secrets it has heard ; and the vows; and never a word of
warning as to what it knew of the results. Is it malicious;
or only sardonic—that chuckling down there? But it is
better to make a joke of it. Everything gets laughed away
in time."
All that bygone period seemed far away ; and beautiful
in a fashion, now that the pain of parting with it was over.
It had enriched his life; there were innumerable pictures
he could conjure up-always with Kitty smiling and
pleasant as the central figure; perhaps, too, it had given
him a key to unlock some of the secrets and mysteries of
existence. Was there any need to think harshly of poor
Kitty or to speak of betrayal or falsehood? We do not
quarrel with the dead. She was as one dead to him ; and
the memory of her was not tragic, or even pathetic, but
rather pretty, with a vague and poetical charm around it.
It had been pathetic and tragic enough, and darkened with
terror and pain and the wrestlings of despair ; but now,
when he thought of her, he saw a laughing and pleasant
Kitty, rather inclined to be impertinent, and wandering
carelessly in sweet woodland ways. It was never for Kitty
to rise to the level of this other and beautiful nature that
he knew; that was linked with his; that provoked his
wonder and admiration the further that he saw of its noble-
ness and simplicity. No; Kitty was a charming little
coquette; tender in a way; not without her good points ;
and a very fitting heroine for love-verses in the Cork
Chronicle.
And yet-and yet, there was a kind of tremulousness
about those pictures that rose before him ; he could not
quite coldly regard them, and ticket off their literary value ;
sometimes a trace of the nameless fascination and glamour
of youth came wandering down through the years-a

memory of something that he had seen in Kitty's eyes.
Was it the night in the South Mall; the streets all swim-
ming with mud and rain; the gas-lamps shining golden on
the pavements; these two under one umbrella ; and Kitty
suddenly turning her face to him? Or was it the
Sunday morning up by the barracks; a spring morning,
with the rooks cawing, and the air sweet; and Kitty, not
knowing he was there, and going by him, and then raising
the tear-filled eyes with astonishment and a quick glad light
of love? Kitty had pretty eyes in that olden time; and
a pretty voice, too, whether she was laughing, or singing
about the Bells of Shandon, or only teasing poor old Miss
Patience.
He rose. To look over one's life in this way, however
satisfied one may be with the existing result, is a sad kind
of thing; and the stream down there in the semi-darkness
seemed no longer chuckling and laughing at the follies and
dreams of youth, but rather saying something of a farewell
as it hurried away to the sea. “ Farewell—farewell.” So
lives pass to the unknown, and are forgotten.
He laid hold of one of the bushes, and clambered up
into the moonlight again, and crossed the open space to
the wall; then for a second he turned and glanced up and
down the little valley, that lay there so white and still. He
was glad it had chanced to be so beautiful a night. This
was a peaceful picture that he would carry away in his
memory. In bygone years he had looked forward to a
solitary keeping of his tryst with a shuddering dread; but
what was there to dread about it? It was a pretty place;
and he had awakened some recollections that had a sort of
half-pathetic poetic fancy about them. That was all. He
wished he could paint the glen as it looked now; but he
thought it would be difficult to convey the sense of solitude
and remoteness that the perfect silence produced.
He mounted the wall and leapt down into the road.
“Well, Master Frank,” said he, lightly, “I am sorry to
have kept you waiting so long; I almost think you'll want
some supper when you get back.”
But he found the boy standing up in the carriage, and
looking wonderingly along the road behind them.

" Papadid you bed for a
“Papa,” said he, with an expression almost of alarm on
his face,“ did you see her? Did you see the lady?”.
Fitzgerald stopped for a moment: he was just about
ring the carria he said, in a lady in mourned. " I dont
“ What lady ?” he said, in a perfectly calm voice.
“Didn't you see her? A lady in mourning," the boy
said ; and now he seemed to be more reassured. “I don't
know who she is. I don't know her ; but she came up
and spoke to me."
His father regarded him, apparently unable to say any-
thing; his hand still grasping the door of the carriage. .
“She said, 'Is your name Willie?' I said, “No; my
name is Frank.' Then she said, “But it is Frank Fitzgerald,
is it not?' I said, “Yes.' Then she said, “Will you let me
kiss you ?' And she was crying when she lifted her veil.
And then she went away along the road back there.”
Fitzgerald glanced along the road; there was no one
visible. Then, with every appearance of composure, he
stepped into the carriage ; shut the door; and said
briefly—
“ Home, Murtough.”
“Papa," said the boy, presently, “who was she?”.
“How can I tell ? Don't bother me—not at present."
There was a strange look on his face, as they drove on
in silence. Frank remembered his mother's injunctions ;
when his father seemed disinclined for talking, he could
keep his mouth shut. And indeed they were near to
Inisheen before Fitzgerald again spoke.
“Don't you see, Frankie,” he said carelessly, “it is the
most natural thing in the world? Of course there are
plenty of visitors always coming down from Cork to the
seaside—to the villas I showed you; and on such a beautiful
night why should not any one go out for a walk? Or the
lady who spoke to you may belong to some house in the
neighbourhood; there is a little village, Carrigha, not more
than half a mile farther on. Why, it's the simplest thing in
the world. It is just the night for any one to come out
for a stroll. But I am beginning to doubt whether there
was any such person. You were thinking of the fairies,
Frankie—wasn't that it ? "

“Murtough saw her, papa !”
“Oh, well; a visitor in the neighbourhood, no doubt,"
he said absently.
“But how did she know my name ?" said the boy, still
wondering.
“That's what she didn't know," said his father—though
he seemed to be talking about one thing, and thinking
about another. “As for guessing at Fitzgerald—that is
nothing. It is simple to make a guess like that. Every
one about here is a Fitzgerald or a M'Carthy. That is
nothing. No doubt she belongs to Carrigha. What was
she like, did you notice ?”.
He spoke with indifference; but did not look at the
boy.
"N—no,” the small lad said doubtfully, "for she was
crying—and—and I was frightened.”
“But she kissed you ?"
“Oh yes.”
His father was silent for some time.
“Perhaps the lady has lost a little boy of about your
age,” he said by-and-by.
“Perhaps that is it,” Master Frank said thoughtſully,
“ for she was dressed all in black.”
Then they rattled through the streets of the little town,
and drew up at the door of the hotel.
“Now, Master Frank,” said his father, when they were
both together in the sitting-room, "you must be up early
to-morrow; for we have to drive all the way to Cappoquin;
and we ought to be there as soon as Mr. Ross."
“Tomorrow? So soon as that? I would like to have
stayed some days at Inisheen, papa," said Master Frank,
wistfully.
“Why?"
“To see all the places you have told me about. I
would like to have seen the cabin where Jerry the tailor's
hawks are ; and—and the place where the bull went into
the bog; and mamma said I was to be sure to cut her a
piece off the hawthorn-tree.”
“What hawthorn-tree ?"
“The one you used to climb up; and the branches

spread out at the top; and you used to have a seat there,
and a book, and no one could see you- "
“Do you know, Master Frank, that cutting memorial
bits off trees and carving your name on window-shutters are
amongst the most heinous of crimes? And it would be no
use your remaining in Inisheen, and trying to see all these
places, for you can't get about easily at present, poor chap.
No; some other time we will have a longer stay here; and
perhaps we will come over in the winter; and then you
might go out with me for a night after the wild-duck;
wouldn't that be fine ?".
“Oh yes, papa.”
“And meanwhile we must get away at once from Ini-
sheen, so as not to keep Mr. Ross waiting at Cappoquin or
Lismore. When I was at your age I could easily get ready
to start by seven.”
“Do you mean seven to-morrow morning, papa ?”
“ Yes."
“Very well. I will be ready by seven."
And still he lingered about the room, without saying
good-night
“Papa," said he, at length,“ when I told you about the
lady, why did your face turn so white ?"
His father was sitting at the fire, staring into it; and
did not hear.
“Come and say good-night, my lad,” he said presently,
“and I will call you at half-past six, if you are not up.
You are sure you won't have any supper? Very well, good-
night !”
“But I was asking you, papa--"
“Asking me what ?".
“Why did your face turn so white when you were in
the road, and I told you I had seen the lady ?"
“Nonsense-nonsense! Your head has got filled with
fancies to-night, my lad—you were too close to Elfinland,
perhaps. Good-night; and don't dream of Don Fierna.”
“Good-night, papa.”
The next morning was again fine; and they had every
prospect of a beautiful drive along the banks of the richly-

wooded river. And when Master Frank, seated in the
landau, and having his sprained ankle carefully propped
and cushioned, understood that he was to see something
more of the Blackwater, he almost forgot his disappointment
over missing the various places at Inisheen he had expected
to visit.
“Of course, papa," said he, “you'll show me the very
spot where you fell in and lost the salmon ?”.
“We shall go near there anyway," said his father, as
they started, and drove away through the town.
“And you'll show me the moorhen's nest, won't you ?”
“What moorhen's nest ?” — for, indeed, this boy's
memory was wonderful.
“Don't you remember, papa, you told me about a
moorhen that had got a bit of wicker-work by chance and
had pieced it into her nest. I should like to see that."
“Bless the boy !-do you imagine that the nest is in
existence yet? All these things that I have told you about
happened years and years ago."
They were now away from the houses; and he rose in
the carriage, and turned to have a last look at the place
they were leaving. Inisheen looked fair enough in the
early light. The shallow green waters of the bay, the boats
by the quays, the Town Hall with its golden cock, and the
terraced hill with its gardens, were all shining in the morn-
ing sun; and far beyond the harbour the pale blue sea was
broken here and there with sharp glints of white, for there
was a fresh breeze blowing in from the south. When he
sat down again there was an absent look on his face.
“That moorhen's nest, Master Frankie,” said he, regard-
ing the thoughtful eyes of the boy, “belongs to a time long
gone by; and things change. Poor lad, that is a lesson
you will have to learn for yourself some day.”
