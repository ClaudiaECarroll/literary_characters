MRS. BLIGH.
CHAPTER I.
THE portals of that as unhandsome as high-
ly-frequented place of worship, Holy Trinity
Church, Chelsea, have just let loose the custom-
ary crowd of well-fed, well-to-do attendants, on
the 11.30 Sunday service. Their ears, and let
us hope, their hearts too, have been receiving
the unsparing rebukes, and virile admonish-
ments, weekly administered to them by the in-
cumbent. It is doubtful whether the spirit of
all the encomiums lavished on him by his furred
and feathered flock as they stream home to their
excellent luncheons this sharp-breathed Lenten
Sunday, would please him.
“He was finer than ever to-day!" says a
mother to her daughter, in that tone of æsthetic
relish that might have applauded the manner in
which a popular actor has given a famous point,
or a favourite soprano taken a high note; “I

“ he cer-
think it is the best series we have ever had ; it
outdoes the Beatitudes last year.”
“ I like the Beatitudes best still,” replies the
daughter, “but” — enthusiastically -
tainly is A 1. I tried to catch your eye when
he made that unmistakable allusion to baccarat.
I wonder how Lord — felt! It is so annoy-
ing that we sit behind him, and so could not see
his face. I noticed that he bent his head quite
low down."
“I expect a good many people have come
out not feeling very comfortable,” replies the
parent, with a complacency which shews that
she has no apprehension of belonging to that
distempered band; and in the same spirit of
confident superiority which dictated Totty
Poyser's speech about her brother. “Dey
naughty, naughty boys! me dood !”
“ Mrs. Bligh has gone out of mourning!
cries the girl, with that admirably abrupt
change of idea for which the female mind has a
special aptitude; and indicating a middle-sized
woman, who is lightly and alone walking home-
wards ahead of them. “ I knew what it meant
when she broke out into an eruption of Parma
violets on Septuagesima Sunday."
" She has something yellow about her,

has not she? Dear me, how bad my eyes
are!”
“She has planted a mimosa bush in her
bonnet : she is determined that there shall be
no mistake about her being out of mourning.
I fancy”—uncharitably—“ that inside she has
been out of mourning some time.”
“Poor woman, one cannot blame her! It
would have been rank hypocrisy in her to have
pretended it was anything but a happy release ;
and I hear that, in spite of her mimosa, she has
a perfect horror of a second venture. Ah,
,
Mr. Blank” (to a beautifully-clad young gentle-
man, who now joins them), “I hope you took
the baccarat to heart. We were just talking
of Mrs. Bligh. I was saying that I hear she has
a perfect horror of a second marriage.”
The young man, in answer, gives a “h'm !”
half facetious, and wholly dubious; and both
ladies laugh.
“ That is what no man could ever be induced
to believe about any widow!" one of them says,
and then they all turn a corner and disappear.
Meanwhile the unwitting person whose
name has been thus bandied about walks on,
with that light step which means in her case
less youth, though she is young, than a strong,

if temporary, cheerfulness, which seems to be
blowing her softly along her homeward road,
like a pleasant light breeze. It blows her into
the door of a little clean house in Tite Street
(obviously she is not rich, since she lives in Tite
Street), up a narrow staircase, which yet with
its white paint and its matting dado, is not with-
out its claim to elegance; and into an exceed-
ingly unpretentious, yet palm-y and daffodill-y
drawing-room, where her three dogs—a woman
with so many dogs must needs be childless-
receive her, each after their manner. Sall,
with characteristic blundering stupidity, mis-
takes her for a burglar, and rushes barking at
her; Tory, too comfortable to stir out of her
fireside basket, sleepily waves a civil but not
enthusiastic tail; while poor little Twankle
wreathes his silly hairy face in joyous simpers
to express his rapture at welcoming her back
from the perils of morning service. She an-
swers each one suitably, but not, as they all
feel, quite so whole-heartedly as usual, and
pushing them gently aside, walks over to the
fireplace and looks at herself in the neo-Adams
glass over the chimney-piece. As she does so,
she smiles. There are happy women who pos-
sess faces at whose reflection one would think

they must needs always smile. But Mrs. Bligh
is not one of these-a fact of which no one is
better aware than she. And yet presently as
she looks, her smile grows into a laugh, and she
says out loud, as people who live alone gain a
habit of doing, “ I am looking so nice, almost
handsome. Like Miss Squeers."
The dogs are so surprised at her lonely
mirth that she laughs again, and, in the excess
of her good spirits, catches up Tory in her arms,
and makes her also look at herself in the mirror.
But Tory has no personal vanity, and turns
away her fawn-coloured head, bored, and yawn-
ing. With a kiss Mrs. Bligh sets down the
pretty Sybarite, who presently forming with
the other two a little dismal row, sends re-
proachful yaps through the uprights of the
balcony down after her mistress's figure, as
with a step even cheerfuller than that which
had brought it home from church, it lessens
along the sunshiny street. Mrs. Bligh's enter-
tainer lives in May Fair; so she has plenty of
time to get up an appetite during her long
walk, by her Chelsea's squalid King's Road,
and by dull Eaton Square, up correct Gros-
venor Place, and through the Park, where the
crocuses, strewn so prettily broadcast, are be-

ginning to push their March fires between the
grass blades.
Her calculations of her own
speed must be a little out, as she finds her host-
ess alone in her drawing-room.
“How springy you look!” her friend says,
with a glance at the “mimosa bush,” after all a
very modest little shrub, in her bonnet; "and
what a colour you have got!”
“ Is that a euphemistic way of telling me my
nose is red?" replies the guest, laughing, yet glad-
dened by the flattering tone, as only a bright-
witted plain woman, whose mind gets a great
many more compliments than her body, can be.
“Oh, no; it is not at all red; at least, noth-
ing to speak of,” rejoins the lady of the house,
absently, being, indeed, much more occupied
by the thoughts of her approaching luncheon
party than by care for the state of her friend's
complexion. “I am so glad you are here so
early, as I shall have time to tell you who is
coming. They are all men-you will not mind
that?—but I am afraid I have not got any spe-
cial friend of yours.”
“My men-friends might be counted upon the
fingers of one hand, with a good many fingers
to spare," replies Mrs. Bligh, gravely. “So that
is not very surprising.”

Well, there is Mr. Stanley, who is our First
Secretary of Legation at Petersburgh. I be-
lieve he has some awful stories about the famine
in Russia."
“I hope he will not tell them at luncheon."
“ Then there is Mr. Blank, the Theosophist.
He wants to become a Mahatma; so he has lived
upon slops for fifteen years.”
• Will that make him a Mahatma ? "
Oh, he thinks it will help him to get up to
a higher level, or some such rubbish!”
“ Yes?"
“Well, then there is the coming impression-
ist painter, Mr. Stannay; you remember that
portrait by him of Mrs. Glanville Thomas in
the New Gallery last year. He painted her in
a strong north light, as he always does, and
made'such an object of her that she wanted her
husband to prosecute him for libel.”
“ Yes?”
“ Then there is the author of that Ibsenish
play, which was acted only once, because the
Lord Chamberlain stopped it after the first per-
formance, so provoking, just as I had taken
tickets. It is in the house, but I have never had
time to look at it."
“What have I done to be included in so illus-

trious a band?" asked the visitor, half ironic-
ally, and yet half seriously too; “but I suppose
in the most recherché feast there must be bread
and potatoes. I am your bread and potatoes.”
“I
may have Wyndham,” pursues the host-
ess, still too preoccupied to pay much heed
to her companion's interpolations; “he asked
me to let him leave it open; he is perfectly
worn out. They have been rehearsing their
new piece till three every morning ; fancy that!
but he said he would come if he possibly
could!"
“ At every fresh celebrity you mention, I
feel more and more inclined to crawl among
the legs of the piano,” says Mrs. Bligh, still with
that mixture of irony and serious meaning ;
“how will you account for me? You will be
as put to in explaining me as Mrs. Blanco White
was the other day in the case of the solitary
obscurity who had crept into one of her lion'
parties, and whom she had to introduce as · Mr.
Smith, who-who-whose uncle was so fearfully
mangled in the Tay Bridge disaster.'
“Then there is Robert Coke, the sculptor,
of course you know who I mean."
Mrs. Bligh has been all along expecting this
name; so she hopes that she shows no par-

ticular emotion now that it has been pro-
nounced.
“ Sir Robert he is now,” pursues the hostess,
only I always forget to call him so. You
know he was K.C.B.'d the other day.”
“Not K.C.B.'d,” corrects Mrs. Bligh quickly,
the next instant regretting that she has done so.
“The Queen made him a Baronet.”
"A Baronet-yes, to be sure, so she did. I
suppose you saw it in the papers ?”
It is a careless question which does not
trouble itself about an answer, and the woman
to whom it is addressed would much rather not
give one, and yet with a diseased honesty she
thinks it necessary to reply.
No, I did not- he told me of it him-
self.”
“ You know him ?_” cries the other, with an
air of extreme surprise tinged with regret; “if
I had known that I would have put you near
him.”
Mrs. Bligh is conscious of a dry inward
amusement coupled with the undoubted disap-
pointment, which she receives from the implica-
tion that her place at luncheon is not to be in
the great man's neighbourhood. It is obvious
that she is held to be far too obscure and unin-

teresting to be set within the radius of the big-
gest star in Lady St. George's firmament.
“I am afraid it is too late to change it now,
it would entail the alteration of my whole table
and you can talk to him after luncheon.”
“I have not the slightest reason for suppos-
ing that he will wish to talk to me,” says Mrs.
Bligh, with precipitate brusqueness and with an
absurd superstitious feeling that even to imply
a desire on the part of the person alluded to, to
converse with her, will be the surest way of
preventing his “changing the weather" with
her.
“And so you know him?" the curiosity of
the question coloured, as its object feels with a
yet drier sense of contentment than before, by a
distinct increase of respect; “why, you always
tell me that you do not know anybody!”
"I do not; knowing him was only an acci-
dent!"
“A very pleasant accident! I wish such ac-
cidents happened to me! Is not he delight-
ful?"
Even Mrs. Bligh's distorted sense of probity
does not insist on her answering this question,
and Lady St. George continues :
“I wonder how you came across him ? Was

it at any common acquaintance of ours? at the
house of any one I know ?"
Mrs. Bligh is looking straight before her;
and her voice is trenchant and dry.
“ I should not think so. I met him last
Christmas at the house of a relation of mine, of
whose wife he was doing a bust.”
• H'm! I am afraid his women are not as a
rule quite as good as his men and his animals."
Mrs. Bligh reddens as if the disparagement
had been of herself.
They were all delighted with it,” she says
shortly and with warmth; the next second re-
penting of the officious ardour of her defence,
the more so when she sees the vague surprise
at such hot partisanship written in Lady St.
George's eyes, and hears her next sincerely re.
gretful words.
“ I wish I had known earlier that you were
such great friends."
“But we are not!" cries the other, in a dis-
claimer quite as eager as her late championship.
“ You must not run away with such an idea ; we
get on very well when we meet but-

door, she does not perceive that the object of
discussion, who unlike all artists and most celeb-
rities has small but gracious virtue of punctual-
ity is entering the room. The sculptor has per-
fectly heard her reason and denial of intimacy
with somebody, has instantly and justly con-
cluded that that somebody is himself; and be-
ing a humane person, lingers over his salutation
to the lady of the house, before, in answer to
the latter's smiling “ Here is a friend of yours!”
he turns to greet her. Her mode of showing
her confusion is to receive him with glacial
frigidity, and as the perfect courtesy of his
manner is uncoloured by any tinge of empresse-
ment, Lady St. George feels not unnaturally that
her friend has misled her. Why did she give
me to understand that they were intimate?” is
her inward reflection ; " they are evidently noth-
ing of the kind.” She is confirmed in this opin-
ion by the prompt and comfortable way in which
the artist drops into the corner of the sofa be-
side herself and remains there, while the guests
arrive, and interpose their frock-coated figures
between him and the lady, whom he shows no
slightest symptom of a desire to approach. “He
does not know that I am not to be near him at
luncheon!" is the poor woman's thought; “oh,

if someone would tell him." The aspiration in its
naif unlikeliness is worthier of a mind of seven-
teen than one of twenty-nine, and she realises
how far it is from being fulfilled, when, on the
move to the diningroom, she finds that her
allotted place is between the author of the “sup-
pressed ” drama and a young unknown; whose
insignificance is sufficiently proved by the fact
that he has not been thought worth including in
the hostess's descriptive catalogue. For the first
moment or two her irrational disappointment-
for had not she known it all along ?-is so great
that she can't lift her eyes from her plate. Was
it for this that she had but half listened this morn-
ing to the pungent eloquence of the great
preacher? that she had planted in her bonnet
that unfitting Aag of festival, that garish, futile
mimosa sprig? After a while she lifts her look
and snatches a furtive glance at the other end of
the table to see whether her mortification is in
any degree shared by the object of it. But a
distinguished man of fifty, renowned for the
goodness of his manners, cannot wear his heart
on his sleeve, whatever an unimportant widow
of twenty-nine may do. On his face even she
cannot find the faintest indication of disappoint-
ment, nor if she could look into his heart would

she find much. His thoughts, if translated into
words, would probably run thus. “ Poor dear
woman, I should like to have had her next me;
but she would not have allowed me to speak to
anyone else; she would not have eaten a mouth-
ful of luncheon or let me eat any; on the whole
it is quite as well as it is." Seeing him so philo-
sophic, she would fain be philosophic too; and
tries to throw as much life and sprightliness as
a very crestfallen spirit and an unfortunately
truthful nature will allow into her opening re-
marks to her neighbour the playwright. But
whether it be that the Lord Chamberlain lies
heavy on his soul, or that he does not think her
worth talking to (she herself attributes it to the
latter cause), he responds to her one observation
so curtly that she resentfully determines not to
hazard another. She must either apply herself
to her fellow-obscurity on the left-hand side or
address herself to listening. The diplomatist, it
seems, is an old acquaintance of the sculptor's
(although she flatters herself with the latter's in-
timacy, how little she knows of his life really),
and now though happily reticent about the Rus-
sian famine, is telling the artist a good story. It
is apparently about a celebrated actress. “You
know how magnificent her proportions are

now," laughing ; “well, I assure you, ten years
ago she was acting at the Gymnase in a part
where she had to fall down in a fit or a faint, or
something ; she was then such a skeleton that a
Frenchman describing it to me afterwards said,
“ C'était une véritable-
But what the
Frenchman said Mrs. Bligh is not destined to
hear; for, at this stage, a hesitating voice at
her left elbow-hesitating, but yet loud enough
effectually to drown the point of the story-
strikes in with a timid remark:
“I think that we have an acquaintance in
I think that you know Miss Smith.”
“I know twelve compound and twenty-five
single Miss Smiths,” answers she brusquely ;
but she might as well have been civiller and
more leisurely, for by the time that she can re-
store her attention to what is passing at the
other end of the table both the tale and the
topic have passed by, and given place to an-
other. It is her own friend who is the spokes-
man now, and how respectfully everyone is
listening to him! This is sure to be something
really worth hearing:
“ He the Bishop was dining one day at a
house, where the footman upset a whole plate of
soup down his back, right between his neck and

his collar; he only looked round the table and
said very mildly, 'Would some'”–
But the prelate's bon mot is destined to be as
much lost upon Mrs. Bligh as the Parisian’s, for
again the irritating voice beside her interposes,
“Do not you think that it is quite a misfor-
tune to have such a common name as Smith ?”
“I know far worse misfortunes,” replies the
widow pregnantly, turning first a homicidal
look, and then a determined shoulder upon her
tormentor.
“Who is the poor wretch whom you have
been tossing and goring ?” asks a caressing,
good-humoured voice in her ear, as she leaves
the dining-room. “I am glad it is not '
me this
time!” and after all her anticipations, this is the
sum of her conversation with her friend.

CHAPTER II.
IF, like Richard II.'s queen, Mrs. Bligh had
set forth-
“Adorned hither, like sweet May,"
she is certainly, as was that poor lady
“Sent back like Hollowmas, on shortest day.”
She has scarcely energy enough to turn the
latchkey in her own door, or climb the stairs,
which all the dogs—even lazy Tory-come
trundling noisily down to meet her. They can
hardly believe their ears when she crossly bids
them get out of her way. But there is a far
severer disappointment in store for them than
that caused by any want of amenity in her man-
ner, when they by-and-by discover that their
earthly providence is not going to take them
for their usual Sunday walk. They watch her
nervously as she irritably pulls up the blinds,
rattles the poker among the sleeping coals, and
finally throwing off her cloak, Alings herself into
an arm-chair. One slight spark of hope lingers

in their minds, from the fact of her not having
taken off her bonnet, but by-and-by even this
dies out. It is difficult for a kind-hearted person
to resist the urgent entreaty of six humbly in-
sistent eyes, and though in the case of Mrs.
Bligh's dogs the number is reduced to five-
since Sall was relieved of one in early life by a
cat-her will generally melts like wax before
the fire of that mutely eloquent joint stare. To-
day she is obdurate. It is not that she is At
Home on Sundays, being rather new to London,
with few acquaintances and less belief in any
ardent desire on the part of those few to see
her. The one person whom she had credited
with a taste for her conversation has to-day
with unmistakable plainness shown her her
That she should ever have fallen into so
gross a one makes her face blaze now into a
flame, not kindled by the sulky fire, before
which she lies in her arm-chair, blaze so that
even the dogs' eyes trouble her and she puts up
both hands to hide them out, while from be-
tween her fingers ejaculations such as “ fool,”
“idiot,” “fatuous folly,” shoot out, uttered
aloud into the silent and empty room. Looked
back upon now, the foundations on which she
had built her towering superstructure of hopes

of his notice and belief in his interest are seen to
be flimsy in the extreme. What are they, these
foundations, when examined with coolness and
reason? Three months ago she had accident-
ally met him at an inexpressibly dull Dorset-
shire Manor House, whither his work. had
brought him, and when a snow-fall had detained
him, bitterly against his will. Through five
dreary days of frozen captivity she-her indif-
ferent jokes, her slight smattering knowledge of
the books he loved, her stupidly undisguised
admiration for himself—had been the refuge of
his ennui ; a fact he had recognized and shown
his generous gratitude for since, by spending
upon her two or three of his rare half hours of
leisure and liberty. Until to-day she has never
met him in any company except her own, or
that of her bucolic cousins, has never seen him
in the Milieu' in which he habitually lives.
Amid the polyglot company at luncheon there
had been no ladies for him to wound her feelings
by showing any preference for over her, none
except the hostess, who had been far too much
occupied in making her party go off to have
leisure or inclination for private dalliance with
any one member of it, even the leading lion.
Yet, as Mrs. Bligh's memory recalls the half

words so immediately understood, the illusions
so instantly grasped by her friend which in
most cases had been Greek to her, she has an
uncomfortable sensation of having been out of
it, of being the hungry little street boy staring
in through the window at the Christmas roast
goose into which he will never thrust his knife.
Out of it! Out of his life! Out of his inter-
ests! Out of all but his charity! As he would
give an old woman in a workhouse half a
pound of tea, or a screw of tobacco, so he has
thrown her ten civil words or a kind look, and
she has mistaken these paltry alms for the mag-
nificent gift of his equal friendship. This is no
doubt reserved for the feminine part of that
society with the masculine half of which she has
to-day seen him on such terms of gay cordiality.
He has always told her that he greatly prefers
women to men. If, then, such is the heartiness
and warmth of his manner to the husbands and
fathers, what must it be to the wives and
daughters? She knows that he is always at
home on Sundays receiving his friends in his
studio, on a general invitation, which he has ex-
tended to her, but of which she has hitherto
been too shy to avail herself. Lying dismally in
her rumpled arm-chair, she pictures him doing

the honours of his beloved atelier, surrounded
by beautiful women who are going to sit to him,
by witty women with whom he is exchanging
flashing repartees, by sympathetic women, to
whom he is explaining his ideas, before they are
translated into stone. Mrs. Bligh is one of the
many English women who gratuitously embitter
their lives by cold Sunday supper instead of
dinner, and by allowing her servants a right of
almost universal exodus, ending in the crown-
ing gaiety, so dear to every servant's heart, of
evening church. The result to herself is a crop
of small discomforts, in unremoved tea-table,
late and ill-lit lamps and oddly announced visit-
ors, whose names suffer strange metamorphoses
in the mouth of an unaccustomed underling.
To this latter inconvenience she has not been
exposed to-day, since she has had no callers, and
now it is too late to expect any, as the clock's
finger points to a quarter to seven. The idea
strikes her rather bitterly that London out of
all its five millions has not spared one friendly
human face and voice to her. Shall she go to
evening church like the servants ? No, she will
not offer her boredom to God. But she will at
all events put an end to this contemptible and
idle feeling over the inevitable, and will ring for

the tarrying lights, to help her by occupation, to
rout her demon of discontent and sloth. She
rises and pulls the bell, thinking, as it peals
through the house, how like it is in sound to
the hall.door one, which has hung so idle
through the long afternoon. She does not
again sit down, but stands with foot on fender,
and hot forehead leant against the white wood
of the chimney-piece, a position she still keeps
when the door opens in answer, as she supposes,
to her ring.
“Bring the lamps !” she says, with her head
still lying sideways on the mantelshelf, but her
languid order is drowned in a universal upris-
ing rush and clamour of the dogs. Why should
they bark so loudly at their own familiar scull-
ion ? Their mistress raises her head to put
this question to them, and finds herself facing
one who is strangely dressed for a kitchen-maid
in a grey frock coat and a head to match, a
head that, though grizzly, is thick-clad and
curly.
“ It's you, is it,” she says in an odd jerky
voice, and though her visitor knows her and her
voice rather well he has a moment of misgiving
that he is not welcome.
“ Send me away if I am too late," he says,

apologetically. “I am late. I see you have
got rid of all your other friends."
* They were such a crowd that they had a
difficulty in squeezing through the door," re-
plies she, laughing drily, adding, with an un-
graciousness oddly out of harmony with her
real feelings, “I thought that you were always
at home on Sundays?”
"Do not speak in that ferocious voice," re-
plies the sculptor, looking round for a safe
place on which to deposit his hat and stick out
of reach of the dogs, and having found it sub-
siding on to a pouf at his hostess's feet. “Are
you going to dance on me as you did on that
unhappy innocent at luncheon ?"
Her breath comes a little fast with the pleas-
ure of seeing these indications of a proposed
stay on the part of her visitor, but her answer
does not display much softness.
“If I danced it was the Dance of Death!
Did you ever see anything so ill-managed?
Was not I wretchedly placed ? I could not
help thinking of a tale of a friend of mine who
was sent into dinner with a terrific bore, and in
the middle of the feast burst out crying from
sheer ennui. I could have followed her example
without any difficulty.”

He looks up at her-her chair is on a much
higher level than his low seat-startled, perhaps
a little disturbed at the unnecessary vehemence
of her expressions of annoyance; and for the
moment has no rejoinder ready.
Well, at all events, somebody was pleased,"
continues Mrs. Bligh ; "you were in your ele-
ment; you, at least, enjoyed yourself !”
“I!”repeats he, with an air of extreme sur-
prise ; “my dear lady, you must be joking. I
went because our hostess has never ceased
asking me to luncheon since last Christmas
twelve-month; and because "—with a timely, if
not very sincere afterthought—" because I knew
that I was to have the pleasure of meeting you
there."
She is aware that the last clause of this sen-
tence is not strictly true, but it gives her such
pleasure to even half believe it, that she lets it
pass undisputed. “And, you know," he adds,
with a smile, whose sweetness takes away any
of the implied rebuke that his words might
seem to convey, "you know, that, pleasant as
it would undoubtedly be, one cannot always
wear one's heart outside without inconven-
ience."
“ I know one cannot,” she answers; “ though

it is where for nine-and-twenty ill-spent years I
have carried mine!” Then, hurrying shyly
away from the subject of that organ which
between man and woman can seldom be dis-
passionately discussed, “ If you were not en-
joying yourself at luncheon, you were at least
the cause of enjoyment in others. What good
stories you and your friend were telling! I
am sure they were good, though that little mis-
creant beside me prevented my ever reaching
their point. What do you think he kept
asking me? while I was straining my ears to
catch your bon mots, whether I knew Miss
Smith ? I answered that I knew two hundred
and fifty Miss Smiths, and begged him to hold
his tongue.”
"I should not think he needed much beg-
ging after that,” says Coke, with a smile, and a
half thought of what an impossible woman to
make love to this odd, prickly little friend of his
would be.
“Did I know Miss Smith ?" repeats she,
with an ire that is half put on, because she feels
that it is amusing him ; and yet is half sincere
too.
"I do not know whether you did, but I
know a Miss Sinith,” rejoins Coke, still lazily

amused at her vehemence; "that is to say, I
know one more Miss Smith than I did yester-
day; not a hard, plain Smith, but some pretty
little compound, though I cannot remember
what it was. She was brought to my studio by
an old Gorgon to whom I have to be civil be-
cause she is ordering a big fountain with river
gods and a little Nereid. I must show you the
clay sketch, dear friend, for her place in Bed-
fordshire; and this little wild rose Smith came
with her, and she knows you, and loves you, and
we made great friends over you!”
“Was it Pamela Capel-Smith ?” asks Mrs.
Bligh, sitting upright in her chair, with her eyes
alight with interest.
He shakes his head, smiling.
“We did not get to Christian names, though
at the rate we were going we might have done
in another quarter of an hour, if that old Medusa
had not carried her off."
“ If it was Pamela,” says the widow, with
emphasis, “she is a darling!”
" Then it was Pamela,” returns he, laughing;
“ for she was a darling; you, at least, ought to
say so, for she raved about you."
A colour that is by no means wholly born of
pleasure, runs over Mrs. Bligh's face.

“I wish she would not; it is so silly of her!
I hope you stopped her.”
Why should I? on the contrary, j'abondais
dans le même sens; but seriously, she spoke of:
you with enthusiastic admiration.”
“I cannot think what possesses her," says
the object of this commendation, in a tone of
such unaffected wonder and disgust, that her
companion laughs outright. “ I could under-
stand her liking me," continues she; “there are
things in me that might breed a moderate lik.
ing; but what is there in me, I ask you, which
could command enthusiastic admiration ?"
As she speaks she fixes on her hearer her
eager and intelligent eyes; and since his own
feeling for her, though sincere, is quite untinged
with ecstasy, and she is too much in earnest to
be put off with a compliment, he is for a mo-
ment at a loss for a reply. Then-
“ She told me,” he says, with a half-hesitat-
ing glance at an invalid chair standing in evi-
dent disuse against the wall of the back draw-
ing-room, " of what a hard life you had had ; and
with what wonderful pluck you had borne it."
Her eye follows the direction of his glance, and
her lower lip twitches. Why have you never
talked to me about your past ? ” he inquires in a

tone of very nearly tender reproach; "why did
you leave me to learn from a little stranger chit
what a heroine you have been!”
“But I have not !” cries shc, her trenchant
denial leaping out with the violence as of one
rebutting the accusation of a crime. “If she
told you so, she grossly misrepresented. Come
now, what has she told you?”
The person thus challenged again hesitates
for an instant. It may be roughly averred that
none of us speak of our friends behind their
backs precisely as we should to their faces; and
in the present instance Coke is aware of the
need of adapting and Bowdlerising the state-
ments of his young informant about the de-
parted Bligh, so as to render them palatable to
his widow.
“She told me,” he says slowly, and feeling
his way, “about your marriage, that your hus-
band was paralysed almost from the beginning
of it, and that you nursed him for eight years
devotedly and without a murmur!”
“ Without a murmur!” repeats she, and her
voice, although this time almost inaudibly low,
expresses a disclaimer of the virtues attributed
to her, even more emphatic than her former
vociferous one. Why, I did nothing but mur-

mur. Looking back upon it now, it seems to
me as if I had never done anything else!”
“She told me how wonderfully patient you
had been under the-"
He stops, uncertain how best to paraphrase
the communication that had been made to him.
Though he was paralysed, he had the tem-
per of a devil, and used to throw things at her
head.”
“I never was patient, it is not in me to be;
I was dreadfully sorry for him, yes, that I was "
(her voice shaking a little), “though I do not
know whether he believed even that, and I had
a bad time of it. I had not been married six
weeks when it began, creeping paralysis; and
from that on to the end.” She pauses expressive-
ly; "yes, I had a bad time, but after all, what
was it in comparison of his! a soul as much
alive as yours or mine, in a half-dead body ?”
Again she pauses,“ and yet I often spoke cross-
ly to him, often; he was naturally irritable, who
would not have been?” (a vision of three-legged
stools hurtling through the air passes before
the hearer's mental eye) “ and, of course, I ought
to have understood that it was only disease and
put up with it, but I did not. Often, often, I

half playfully. But she is in downright desper-
ate earnest.
“ As badly as that-worse : it seems incred-
ible now; but I did. I keep that chair,” again
glancing towards the back room, “to remind
me of it!" Her voice has grown harsh : an ef-
fect which emotion always produces upon it, as
she winds up with—" So you'll know for the
future how much to believe of the pretty things
that admiring girls tell you about me!”
There is a silence, infringed only by a fool-
ish bark from Tory, as she catches the sound
of a dog's step in the street outside, being never
able to realise that that thoroughfare is not her
private property.

COKE has not the least notion how to re-

chaise longue, whose ugly presence, cramming
up his friend's little back room, his artistic eye

winner). “Is he to be in bronze or marble?”
“ The Duke cannot make up his mind,” re-
plies Coke, hoping that the relief in his voice at
the changed turn the conversation has taken, is
not as evident to her as it is to himself.
“And is he to stand on two legs or four? I
mean” (laughing)“ not the duke, but the horse ?”
“I can't make up my mind ; you must" (ca-
ressingly) “ come and make it up for me?”

swers she, drily; but she colours faintly, with
pleasure all the same.
They are both standing now, he, preparing
to go; and she, to bid him good-bye. Each
with a foot on the fender and an elbow on the
chimney-piece; they face each other comfort-
ably in the firelight.
“ When will you come? since I knew you,
you have been to the studio only--" He
stops, for the life of him he can't recall the exact
number of her visits. But her memory is more
retentive, "only twice; and, for the present, it
will have to remain only twice, since I am go-
ing out of London."
“ You?”
· Yes, I! Moi qui vous parle, all the rest of
the nobility and gentry (smiling) are turning out
for Easter; why should not I, too?”
“You are always gadding, madam; and
where are you going ? to Dorsetshire?” with a
rather lowered voice, and a not very sincere
sigh, paid to the memory of his sojourn in that
dreary county.
No, not to Dorsetshire;" her voice lagging
with unconscious tenderness over the dear

shaggy top of Mona high'?"
“That was not my leading motive" (again
smiling); " but I daresay mine will turn out near-
ly as inuch of a fool's errand as that would be.

ried jocosity, to avert an apprehended drifting
back into the painful memories of her married
life. That that effort is successful is apparent
by her next remark, thoughtfully uttered.
“When last she saw me my hair was down
to my knees and my petticoats up to them;
how am I to prove to her that I am I?"
“ It cuts both ways. How is she to prove to
you that she is she?”
“ She cannot be as much altered as I am: in
the first place, when we parted, her skirts were
already long, and her hair short. She is three
years older than I. We were school friends. I
was a wretched ugly little girl ; and she was a
fine buxom big one. She always promised me
that I should stay with her when she was mar-

“ No, he is not a Sir. He is only a plain Mr.”
“Well, you must find out all about him for

without the baby."

pull Sall's ear, as with her one eye rolling she
stands up fat and tall, clawing his knee to at-
tract his attention, though when she has gained
it, she has evidently nothing particular to say to
him. “I should like to do a little
group
of
you,
with your dogs, in terra-cotta. I could make a
pretty thing of it!”
“You are a very clever man; but you are
not quite clever enough for that,” replies she,

with one of her habitual and injudicious fleers
at her own appearance ; since there is no such
undoubted fact than that we are all valued at
our own appraisement.
“ And when do you go?"
“On Wednesday.”
“ And I shall not see you again ?" in a re-
gretful tone, and with a still further encroach-
ment on her half of the chimney-piece, by the
grey elbow.
“I
suppose not;” wistfully—so wistfully that
he breaks out into a hurried explanation.
“It is most unlucky; but these two next
days are specially busy ones with me. To-mor-
row H. R. H. comes at five. Royalties are often
late, and of course I do not know how long he
will stay; and on Tuesday I have to go down
into the country to get some more sketches of
Rayon d'Or, and—”
“Of course, I had not the least expectation
of seeing you again,” interrupts she; her harsh
touch reappearing in her voice, with the fear of
having seemed exacting; adding stiffly, “it was
very good of you to come this evening."
“It was very good of you to let me in. Your
little maid—the Sunday locum tenens, is not she?

a funny face, like a gargoyle ; she is rather like
one of those heads on the spouts at Nuremberg.
I must ask her to sit to me; do you give your
consent?”
“ You have my full permission!” replies she;
and he goes away laughing, while she remains
behind, staring into the neglected fire, with a
rather sardonic smile, and a reflective wonder,
as to which work of art will give her distin-
guished friend the greatest pleasure in the exe-
cution: the terra-cotta group of herself and her
dogs, or the gargoyle head of the kitchen-maid?
The latter is fated to have another shock before
the evening is done. Mrs. Bligh is lingering
over her cold chicken and claret, less from any
lively enjoyment of them than from a reluctance
to return to her now doubly empty drawing-
room, when the hall door-bell once again peals.
The idea instantly flashes across the widow's
mind that it is a commissionaire bearing a note
from her late visitor. After all, he has found an
unoccupied half-hour somewhere lurking in the
compass of the next two days. “ Where there
is a will there is a way,” and evidently in this
case there is a will, is her exulting reflection.
But this towering frame of mind lasts only dur-
ing the short space that it takes a quick young

hand to open the door; and a fur-wrapped
young figure to come skipping in.
“ Pamela!"
“Yes, Anne, Pamela! am I too late?" her
face falling at the not very decided welcome of
the word and tone. “Send me away if I am!”
It strikes Mrs. Bligh with a slight and fanci-
ful annoyance, which she would be puzzled to
explain, that both her guests have employed ex-
actly the same words with which to conjure
her displeasure at their unexpected appearance.
“I left them all at dinner-my people, I
mean; they think I have gone to bed. I had to
come and tell you of something so exciting that
has happened. Who do you think I have met ?
Whose acquaintance do you suppose I have
made to-day? Ah!” something in her listener's
face revealing that her tidings came too late-
“ you have heard already? He has told you ?
He has been here since? How delightful !”
Delightful for whom?” playfully, and yet
not very playfully either, “ for me or for him ? "
“Oh, for him most; of course, much the most
for him.” Her nut-brown eyes shining with af-
fectionate enthusiasm ; “but nice for you, too”
(laughing), “ to have such a celebrity basking on

your hearth-rug. I had such a happy talk with
him about you. You should have seen how
cleverly he put off that tiresome Lady – who
took me to his studio, and who wanted to bore
him all the time about a fountain he is designing
for her. He stopped her mouth playfully, you
know; not in the least so that she could take
offence, but yet quite effectually."
“ She will probably, to-morrow, order her
fountain elsewhere."
“I never heard anything more neatly done.
I wish I could remember the exact words."
“Do not try. Nobody's good things bear
carrying, except Sidney Smith's.”
“We talked of nothing but you,” continues
the young stranger, her voice unconsciously tak-
ing a less jubilant inflection, as she feels that the
great news, to carry which, hot and fresh, she
had forfeited her dinner, is falling unaccountably
fiat. “You should have seen the change in his
manner the moment he found that I was a friend
of yours. I told him what extraordinary luck it
was for me, your having taken me up.”
“I wish you would not !” exclaims the other,
impatiently pushing about the spoons and forks
on the dinner table. Then, ashamed of her own
irritability, “let us come up-stairs. I do not

look at her lonely repast—"eating by oneself, is
not it?” Arrived at the drawing-room_“I am
speaking quite seriously,” says the widow, still
battling not very successfully with a certain
tartness of voice. “I do wish you would try to
choose a better subject for your enthusiasm. I
know that you mean it very kindly, but it makes
me look such a fool! as if I encouraged you in
your ludicrously exaggerated estimate of my
merits." The pretty creature thus lectured
looks rather crestfallen.

to le premier venu,” she says, her fresh red under-
lip quivering a little. “I choose people who I
know will be in sympathy with me.

“But the celebrity is quite as foolish about
you, as I am.”
Anne shakes her head almost angrily.
“Did you ever hear of a monosyllable called

“ Yes, I have ; but it has no applicability
here; however, I will not tcase you, since you
do not like it. Time”—confidently—“will show
which of us is right, and meanwhile I have an-
other bit of good news to tell you.”
“ Another?” Mrs. Bligh's eyebrows have
moved up slightly. The tidings, as yet brought,
seem to her scarcely to merit the title of an
Evangel.
“ Yes; I am to be allowed after all to go to
Anglesey, to visit the Mulhollands at the same
time as you. I am even to go on Wednesday.
We may travel together. I shall have you,”-
smiling radiantly—“all to myself from Euston
to Beaumaris."
“ I travel third class.”
“ I do not mind. I have no doubt that it will
amuse me very
much.”
"Your experience will be different from

“ I will tussle too.” They both laugh, and
then Pamela, in a tone of stifled excitement-

Impossible!”—with growing indignation-
"she might be your mother! I think she tries
to make herself look as old as she can, to match
him.”
“ And the step-daughter?”
“Lucile? Oh, she is, as she herself would
express it, 'a ripper.' She is given over to
horses, and dogs, and donkeys."
“ And
my
friend's own child ?”
“Little Sue? Oh, she is a ripper, too."
“They are all rippers, in fact; and the father,
Mr. Mulholland, is the greatest ripper of all, no
doubt?"
The answer to this last query does not come
so trippingly as to the former ones.
“I do not think I should quite describe Mr.
Mulholland as a ripper.”
“ He is very gifted, isn't he ?—witty, accom-
plished, distinguished-looking ?"
The girl hesitates even more perceptibly
than before.
“ Ye-es, I daresay. I suppose so."
“ His wife has certainly always implied
it.”
“Oh, she worships him.”
“ And his children, do they worship him,
too ?”

Mrs. Bligh smiles. “It is very obvious that
you do not agree with them.”

pulls herself up short. “It is not of the least
consequence what I think. I am a wretched

CHAPTER IV.
It is obvious that H.R.H.'s visit to Sir Rob-
ert Coke's studio must have been prolonged to
quite the expected length on Monday after-
noon, and that Rayon d'Or must have swal-
lowed up all Tuesday, for on neither of those
days, though she foolishly stays within doors for
the best part of most of them, does Mrs. Bligh
receive any suggestion of a rendezvous from
her sculptor friend. And on Wednesday she
goes.
Her departure is in a windy pour of
cold rain, and as she watches the dirty moisture
rolling down the sacking-covered back of the
stone-deaf old driver of the four-wheeler which
conveys her to Euston, she asks herself with too
late indignation what is taking her on such a
fool's errand ? She repeats the question inter-
nally as she stands at the door of a rapidly-fill-
ing third-class carriage, trying alternately, and

obviously have their eye upon it, and to dis-

suade her young admirer from sharing her own
too certain discomforts. But Pamela, radiant
with the double brilliance born of happy expec-
tation, and of a really good complexion in wet
weather, keeps her ground stoutly beside the
object of her cult, asseverating with every ap-
pearance of sincerity that it will be very amus-
ing, and that she shall enjoy it of all things.
Finding the uselessness of her remonstrances,
the widow desists, and remains standing on the
platform, glancing with silent indifference at its
occupants, until she catches sight of a figure
which causes her to give utterance to an ex-
clamation of dismay.
“Oh, good heavens, there is that dreadful
bore! Let us get in quick. I do not suppose
that he would recognise me again, but he
might.”
“What dreadful bore?" following the direc-
tion of her friend's eyes, and scanning the pass-
ers-by with a puzzled air.
'I met him at luncheon at Lady St. George's
on Sunday. Oh, he is such a bore !.I should
die if he got into the carriage with us."
"I do not quite see who you mean,”-still
vaguely gazing about.
“He has stopped at the book-stall to buy à

paper. There! do not you see?—that man in
the brown overcoat, with a plaid over his arm."
" That man,” repeats Pamela, having at
length succeeded in discriminating the object
of Anne's animadversions, from the other hurry-
ing or sauntering travellers, while her face ex-
presses a surprise that is rather acute than
pleasant. “Why, that is
Why, that is young Mulholland !"
“Young Mulholland !"
“Yes, youny Mulholland, your friend's step-
son. You knew, did not you, that she had a
step-son, as well as a step-daughter?”
" How truly dreadful!” cries the other, in a
voice that sounds disproportionately aghast for
the occasion. “I did not catch his name on Sun-
day; if I had, of course I should I mean I should
not—" She breaks off, while memory recalls to
her with officious vividness the gratuitous incivil-
ity of her own manner to one who now perverse-
ly turns out to be the son of her intending host.
“I think,” says the girl, turning only the
edge of a very rosy cheek to her companion,
“ that he means—that he intends to travel down
by this train.”
“Of course you were the Miss Smith whom
he tried to talk to me about,” cries Mrs. Bligh,
with a very annoyed laugh, as unpleasant little

accesses of enlightenment keep pressing in upon
her mind. “It was about you that I snubbed
him so ferociously. Oh, why does not one
make a rule to be always civil quand même !
What frightful retributions overtake one! Oh,
here he comes! I really can't face him”-vault-
ing into the carriage as she speaks, over the
bags and bottles already established there, div-
ing into its farthest corner, and sitting down
with her nose against the pane. She does not
again look round till the train is in motion, and
even then the glance she throws over the occu-
pants of the compartment is an apprehensive

Anglican clergyman, five working-women, a

think he meant to get in, too, but I told him-I
persuaded him not.”
“Good heavens!” cries Anne, observing the
want of readiness with which this explanation
is given, while a new billow of remorse and dis-

may washes over her. “I believe that he is a
dear friend of yours—that it was an appoint-
ment.” If the girl colours, it is almost invisibly.
“Oh, he is not bad in his way. I like him
very well in his right place, as people say about
dogs, when they do not care about them "-
laughing—“but,”—with a reproachful accent-
“ do you suppose—can you imagine that I want
him, or any one else, when I have you?"
The widow's sole answer to this declaration
is a good-humoured "Pooh!” and she leans
back in her hard corner, thinking that she is as
little able to rise to her young votary's height
of devotion as was Catherine Morland to recip-
rocate Isabella Thorpe's declaration of how
much dearer she-Catherine-would be to her
than her own sisters. The journey is long, and,
as to discomfort, much what might have been
expected. The adult portion of the two ladies'
fellow-travellers eat
eat obnoxious viands, and
drink nose-offending liquids almost unbrokenly
throughout its course, and the babies go with
unblushing publicity through all the unpleasant
gymnastics common to third-class babies on
their travels. Both Pamela and Anne have
long sunk into a jaded silence by the time that
the sight of the incoming tide splashing the

Welsh coast, along which the London and
North Western Railway runs, revives their
flagging spirits.
“We shall not be long now," says the
younger, encouragingly. “And they are sure
to send to meet us. I hope they will send
something open."
“ Is it a long drive?"
“ Five miles! Beaumaris is five miles from
a station, and they are a mile beyond Beau-
maris. It is a long way; but it keeps the trip-
pers off, so I think on the whole they are glad.”
“ Yes?"
“ It is a lovely road, shaded by trees, and
running along above the Menai Straits. Now
that there are no leaves on the trees, you can
see both them and the mountains opposite beau-
tifully."
“ Yes.”
• They will probably send the waggonette,
and most likely"-with a fresh access of hesita-
tion-"young Mulholland will drive us himself;
you will not mind that? You will not mind his
being on the box?”
Anne breaks into a vexed laugh.
“My dear child, not mind my host's son tak-
ing the liberty of sitting in his own father's car-

Like Cleopatra, ‘Tho' I am mad I will not bite
him!'"
“Oh, no; it is only that you said you
thought him such a dreadful bore!”
“For pity's sake"—impatiently—“do not
quote me against myself, as Madame de Sevigné
said about her tiresome friend: • Dieu me fait la
grâce de ne pas l'écouter'; so Dieu me fait la
gráce never to remember my own speeches! In
mercy, try to imitate me! they are never worth
remembering!
“On the contrary, your judgment is so ex-
cellent that I feel sure you are right. I have no
doubt that he is a bore! I wonder”—thought-
fully—“that it never struck me before !”
“And I am sure he is nothing of the kind”
-with a too late compunctious effort to repair
the mischief she had done; and repenting, for
not the first time in her life by many, her inabil-
ity to keep her tongue between her teeth.
Third-class passengers seldom possess ladies'
'
maids, and Mrs. Bligh is accustomed, though
never wholly reconciled, to the necessity of
wrestling for her own luggage. She is prepar-
ing to do so, when at length deposited on the
platform of the remote Welsh station to which

she is bound. But her intention is forestalled
by a young man in brown, who has instantly
joined her companion ; and who, whether goad-
ed to the action by the latter, or inspired by the
Christianity of his own spirit, now approaches
herself with lifted hat, and with a look and voice
of ill-disguised terror, asks her leave to find her
boxes for her.
“ I do not know why you should have that
trouble,” replies she, abashed; while memory
thrusts upon her the tart request to hold his
tongue, which had been her last observation to
him. “ There are two; both have a large A. B.
on them, and a red and white stripe ; but 1
really do not know why you should take the
trouble."
He is out of hearing before she has half
finished her apologies, and only Pamela has the
benefit of them.
“His manner is very bad,” says the girl
apologetically, and yet in a critical tone which
Anne guiltily feels to be no older than her own
uncomplimentary remarks upon him. “So ab-
rupt, as if he wanted to bite your head off; but
I think he means to be civil.”
“I am sure he does,” cries Anne, eagerly;
and in a minute more he is back with them, and

in her haste to make an amende for her former
lack of civility, she rushes into a well-intended
but brusque pleasantry, as to the large coal fire-
he has been making on the top of her head.
He looks perfectly blank, and she is obliged
to give a lame explanation of her meaning,
which lasts till they reach the waggonette.
The reflection of how far more tactful it would
have been to have let sleeping dogs lie, and
ignored their former meeting, spoils the first
quarter of a mile of her drive. But the thud of
the horses' feet as they trot across the airy Sus-
pension Bridge flung over the sea's arm, the salt
taste of the air after the noisome closeness of
the train ; and, lastly, her young vis-à-vis's bub-
bling joy and pride in doing the honours of the
lovely road which they pursue, soon restore her
equanimity.
"That is Penmaen Mawr!”-pointing through
the naked arch of the tree-boughs, and across the
sun-dancing water of the Straits—"that great
round-headed hill, with the slopes of shale; do
not you remember we passed right under it?
No, you can't see Snowdon, it is too far back;
there is General —'s place that we are passing.

Here"-as they stop at a gate-
we go along a private road that Sir Thomas
Lascelles has made on a higher level than the
public one; he is the local swell here, and the
Mulholland's little grounds join his big ones,
which he allows them to use as if they were their
own."
“Sir Thomas Lascelles," repeats Anne, as
her memory recalls the nameless Welsh baronet
and art patron, concerning whom Sir Robert
Coke had desired her to make inquiries.
“Does he live at Glan something, and is he-
had he a mother?” The girl looks naturally a
little surprised at the idiotic shape taken by the
latter half of these inquiries.
“Glan y Wern. It is a magnificent place;
;
and I suppose he had a mother once; he has not
now."
“Did she die lately ?”
“I do not know; they are not in mourning.
Why do you ask?"
“Oh, I–I–had no particular reason ; mere
idle curiosity," shirking, as usual, the necessity
of mentioning her sculptor. She is saved from
the danger of having to give any more intelli-
gible explanation of her question by young Mul-
holland, who now throws a remark from the

would be easier so to do, since she is sitting on
the opposite side to him, but at Pamela.
Lucile is laid up again.”
“ You do not say so. I thought her sprain
was better."
“So it was, and they said she might take a
quiet little drive; but her idea of a quiet little
drive was to put the two donkeys tandem into
that coster's cart I made her; and in going
through a gate, the new one—the leader-mis-
chievously shut it behind him, leaving the cart
and the wheeler on the other side ; so she was
spilt, and she is as bad as ever now."
“ Poor Lucile !"
“Is she--is your sister very fond of driving
tandem ?” asks Mrs. Bligh, with a second, and
this time not in the least facetious attempt at
conciliation. But the young man either thinks,
or pretends to think, that the inquiry can't be
addressed to him; and it would have fallen with
perfect flatness to the ground had not Pamela,
red with indignation, picked it up.
“Mrs. Bligh is speaking to you, George; she
is asking you whether Lucile is not very fond
of driving tandem ?"
The question thus repeated seems as worth-

less in its original owner's ears as do the twice-
or thrice-shouted inanities which we have all, in
our day, shamefacedly bawled into a deaf man's
ear, and she makes no further effort. They have
trotted through a drowsy little town—saved
from vulgar expansion by its distance from a
railway-along a stone-walled, white road, into
a modest drive, and are nearing a good-sized,
carly-Victorian house with a tower, which stands
looking at the lovely Straits.
“ I am feeling quite jumpy !” says Anne,
with a nervous laugh. “Am I tidy?-is my
bonnet straight ? ”
“ Perfectly; you are always so beautifully
neat, not a hair out of place; nothing could look
nicer than you do!”
Though not wholly crediting these agreeable
assurances, the widow is yet a little comforted
by them; and her eye follows that of her young
friend, which is looking eagerly out ahead, and
who now breaks out into pleased exclamations.
“ Ah! I knew how it would be as soon as
they heard the wheels, they would come flying
out! They are at the door!”

merriment, "all except the sick one?"

There is no time for more, as they have
drawn up at the porticoed door; at which a fair,
fat woman, a long-leggy little girl with an ir-
regularly delightful face, and some servants are
grouped; and in another moment the fat woman
and Anne are standing looking at each other
with undisguised stupefaction; and saying sev-
erally, and with equal brilliancy-
“Here you are!” and “Yes, here we are !”
In yet another moment they are in the draw-
ing-room, and have bethought themselves that
they ought to kiss; which--such utter strangers
do they appear to one another—they do with
a little hesitation. The small familiarity loosens
the string of their tongues.
“Is it really and truly you, Nan?” cries
the hostess, still holding her guest's hand, and
peering at her features with an air of friendly
incredulity.
“ Nan!” repeats the other, in a rather tremu-
lous key.
“How many, many years it is since
any one called me Nan! Yes, Char, I am Nan;
though I sometimes doubt it myself! I believe,"
laughing shyly, “that you expected to see me
still in frilled trousers !"
“Ah, that is more like you,”-in a tone of
relief—“that is just the dry way in which you

used to say things at school. How droll you
were, and how you used to make us laugh!”
“ Did I? I am not at all droll now, I shall
not often make you laugh now.”
“Oh yes, I am sure you will, you were al-
ways so droll.”
The subject of Mrs. Bligh's deceased wag-
geries seems about to drop, without any other
being quite ready to take its place, which the
author of those dead jokes feeling, makes an
awkward snatch—not literally but figuratively
—at the tall little girl, as a new theme.
“And this is Sue? You see I know all about
you."
“ And this is Fezy,” replies the child, not
nearly so much embarrassed as the stranger,
and indicating a tiny coal-black muzzle tucked
under her arm, from which are proceeding such
ear-piercing yaps as could issue only from the
mouth of a Spitz.
“ Poor Lucile is in bed.”
“Yes, how annoying ; the coster's cart"-

“Mr. Mulholland !" cries the hostess in a key
of acute disappointment, as of one forestalled
in the exhibition of some choice rarity. “ Do
you mean-is it possible that you have seen

Czar already? Did he "—turning towards Pa-
mela-"meet you at the station ? "
“I do not think his name was Czar; I think
it was George.”
Oh, only George!”—with an air of relief
-"I thought you could not have seen Czar."
“If I have, it is without knowing it. I am
afraid that I do not quite know who Czar
is.”
'Oh, do not you ? of course not! how stupid
Czar is my husband. We always call
him Czar, he will be in immediately; he is most
anxious to make your acquaintance. I am sure
you and he will get on. I am quite looking
forward to hearing how you will draw each
other out. Ah! you may deny it, but you al-
ways were so amusing.–As for you, Pamela,
dear”—again turning towards the girl, with a
laugh—"you will be nowhere now, not in the
running at all.”
One would think that so harmless, if flat a
pleasantry, would call for an answering word or
smile from a civil visitor, but in Miss Capell
Smith it produces neither. It would seem
doubtful, indeed, whether she heard it, so much
occupied is she in explaining who she is to Fezy,
who is still struggling madly to wriggle back-

wards from out the prison of his young mis-
tress's elbow.
“I am always so glad that he should have
anyone clever and brilliant to talk to," con-
tinues Mrs. Mulholland. “He is so thrown
away, here. I expect it will be a real treat to
hear you two together. Oh, come now, no
false modesty ; you know you always were con-
sidered one of the show girls at Madame Rey-
baud's.”
“But indeed, indeed,”—very earnestly—“I
am far from being a show woman now.”
"Well, we shall judge about that,” returns
the hostess, with knowing confidence, adding,
“I wonder Czar is not in by now; I assure you
that he was quite excited about you.”
“I am very sorry to hear it,”-ruefully-
"some one has just passed the window, perhaps
that was he. But it looked like quite a young
man.”
“Quite a young man !" echoes the wife, de-
lightedly. “I will tell him what you say. Well,
he does look absurdly boyish. I tell him that I
am sure I am often taken for his mother.”
As she speaks the door opens briskly, and a
man's jaunty figure comes in. At the first glance
Anne has a recurrence of her first impression of

the youthfulness of that figure; and it is not till
he has drawn quite near her that she becomes
aware of the unlikely chestnut colour of his
close curls, and of the fine network of little
veins and wrinkles that go to make up the florid
old face wreathed into so many smiles to greet
her. Mrs. Bligh stands up shyly and holds out
her hand; while Mrs. Mulholland cries out in a
voice of delighted expectation of all the brillian-
cies certain to follow upon the introduction.
"Czar, this is Nan! Nan, this is Czar!"
“ Will Mrs. Nan allow me to lay myself at
her feet?” says the old gentleman, bowing over
her hand. “I hope your friend Char has told
you how much we are in your debt for consent-
ing to shine upon our darkness !”
“I have left you to make the pretty
speeches,” replies his wife, with an admiring
smile; “I know that you will do it so much
better than I could !”
“We will do our best to amuse you; but’
with a shrug—“I am afraid we shall have to
ask
you to be lenient, as you see we are a set of
country bumpkins!'
He pauses, evidently to give an opportunity
for the contradiction, which the person addressed
is perfectly incapable of uttering. Seldom in her

life has she been made to feel shyer than she is
now, by the florid amenities offered her and by
the consciousness that the friend of her child-
hood is awaiting with confident expectation the
cascade of conversational fireworks, which she
knows herself to be so perfectly unable to let off.
“We have not much in the way of neigh-
bours," continues Mr. Mulholland with-or she
fancies it—some slight diminution of expansive-
ness at her unresponsive silence, “ of course ex-
cepting the Lascelles’; they are in one's own
monde, and we naturally know where to have
them ; but as for the rest, they are very good
humdrum bodies in their way; but—" with
another shrug.
She hears herself saying something trite to
the effect that country neighbours are apt to be
not very amusing, and he assents.
“I agree, I perfectly agree with you; but
between you and me, when one gets below the
grand monde, political or social, one is apt to
find people everywhere a little provincial, do
not you
think so?"
“I am afraid” (with a dry smile) “ that I am
scarcely a judge, not many of the grand monde
find their way to Tite Street !”
" Ah, you live in Tite Street, a name of

doubtful omen, is not it?” (facetiously) “a good
many people live in Tite Street, ha, ha!”
His wife breaks into a hearty laugh at this
speech, but seeing (with some surprise) as Anne
feels that the latter echoes her mirth but faintly,
hastens to say civilly:
“ I am so little in London that I do not know
Tite Street; but Pamela has told me that Chel-
sea is the height of the fashion, and that you
have made your house exceedingly pretty; have
not you, Pamela ? Why, where is she?" look.
ing in surprise round the room. " She has fled!
Oh, no doubt Sue has taken her to see Lucile?
Will you come and see poor Lucile? Though
she is in bed, it is a shame that she should have
to miss all the good things that I know we may
expect from you two!” glancing affectionately
from one to the other.
“ Then I am not to be banished ? I am to be
admitted?"
His wife giving him an eager permission to
accompany them, he walks rather more spring-
ily than if he were eighteen to open the door
for them; and they all file out.

CHAPTER V.
Miss MULHOLLAND lies in bed, a model of
blooming English vigour, but she has by no
means a monopoly of her couch of sickness.
Pamela sits on one of her pillows, and George
on the other. Sue is stretched all along the side
of the mattress, with two very long black silk
legs kicking up in the air; while to obviate any
danger that may yet remain of the invalid's feel-
ing lonely, a couple of dogs—a short-tempered
lady of the sheep-dog kind, and a broken-haired
white terrier—are having a friendly scrimmage
across her prostrate body. With their mouths
wide open, and showing all their beautiful clean
teeth, they are apparently taking large mouth-
fuls out of each other's eyes. At the entrance
of the visitor, however, they cheerfully break off
their gallantries in order to jump down from
the bed and “make for her;" a proceeding
which, if it has no other advantage, has at least
that of taking off the stiffness of a first introduc-
tion, leading, as it does, to eager assurances on

the part of the young owner that the bristled
backs and rude voices mean nothing; and
counter-assurances on the stranger's side that
she is not at all frightened, that she has dogs of
her own, etc., etc. The ice is still further broken
by Mr. Mulholland, who, having lingered behind
the others, now pounces playfully out from be-
hind the door, and is greeted by his daughter
with a cry of surprise and joy that shows that
his visits to the sick-room are not frequent oc-
currences.
• Czar, is that you ? how awfully, awfully
good of you!”
His response is to ask playfully whether she
has room for one more, and, getting a delighted
assent, sits down on her bed; the dogs also hav-
ing leapt back thither and resumed their tussle.
“I have not often seen an odder regimen for
an invalid!”
“ Ah! now you are beginning !" cries Mrs.
Mulholland, triumphantly ; “that is just the dry
voice in which you used to say things at Madame
Reybaud's. Dear me, how it takes me back!
do go on!"
“She likes us all to sit upon her-do you not,
Luce?” breaks in Pamela, hurrying to the res-
cue, as she sees the consternation painted on Mrs.

Bligh's face at this command to be funny. “We
can't be too thick on the ground, can we?"
“She had the donkey up one day,” cries Sue;
“ we had such difficulty in getting him up-stairs ;
and he was so spiteful, he kicked out one of
Fezy's front teeth."
“ That was not an amiable trait," replies
Anne ; and then, in the terror of being ac-
cused of dryness, adds hastily, “ Was that the
same donkey who behaved so ill in the tan-
dem?"
“Oh, no, that was the new one: he is very
ill-natured, too, but this was the old one, the one
that Pamela and George always drives in the
coster's cart.”
At this innocent and matter-of-fact implica-
tion of an intimacy more developed than she had
suspected between her young disciple and the
person whom she herself had stigmatised as “a
dreadful bore,” Anne steals a guilty glance at
Miss Capell Smith, in time to see with what a
vexed flush the words “I believe I did drive
him once or twice!" are accompanied.
“ Once or twice!” repeats the little girl, in
guileless astonishment. “Why, Pamela, what
are you thinking of? have you forgotten?
When last you were here, you and George were

But George has arisen from his easy lounge

to accompany him, is stalking-an image of
wounded feeling-to the door.

land, placid and unsuspecting ; "we had better
follow his example. Do not make yourself very
splendid” (as she leads the way along the pas-
sage); " for, as you see, we are quite a family
party. No outsider, except Pamela ; and she"
(affectionately) “is not an outsider : she is one
of the family.”
· I am nothing of the kind,” says Pamela, in a
mouthing whisper, behind her hostess's back,
to Mrs. Bligh. “You " (with a spasmodic grate-
ful squeeze of the hand nearest to her) “ have
for ever saved me from that!”
Gratitude is a beautiful thing, and it is very
delightful to have inspired it, when one feels it
is really merited; but Anne has not that happy
consciousness, and she draws away her fingers.
Three-quarters of an hour later she is sitting
at a well-be-lit and be-blossomed dinner-table, at
her host's right hand, and thinking that though
she has made up her mind that she does not

much like Mr. Mulholland, and that she wishes
he would not call her “Mrs. Nan,” yet that
family life is a pleasant thing, and that if she
could be quite sure that the look of expectancy
of bons mots from herself, that never come, had
departed out of Char's mild eyes, she would be
quite enjoying herself.
Miss Capell Smith is seated on the host's
left hand, but, though the arrangement is a nat-
ural one, since there is no other lady, yet Anne
is conscious that it has not been made without
difficulty. She is almost certain of having heard
coming from behind her, as they all entered
the dining-room, an urgent remonstrance in
Mrs. Mulholland's voice, addressed to some-
body. “Pamela! what are you thinking of?
Of course you will sit by Czar! you know he
likes to have you."
On the girl's other side
the injured George has placed himself; and it
is not without a vexed entertainment that Anne
throughout dinner watches her votary's efforts
to do the impossible; and turn a shoulder and
a lump of rust-coloured hair at the same time
impartially upon both her neighbours. Mrs.
Bligh's own right hand is guarded by a person
whom she incidentally learns to be staying in
the house for the purpose of cataloguing the

library. He is an under-bred, forward young
man, who, though never spontaneously spoken
to by any one, interpellates each one in turn
with vulgar familiarity, and takes all the fun
and jokes as if addressed to himself.
“ And how are we to entertain Mrs. Nan
now that we have got her?" asks the host in
a sprightly voice, looking up from a land-rail
which has just been placed before him, and no
duplicate of which has been offered to any other
member of the company, a fact which Anne
notes with surprise, though she had already ob-
served his being supplied with a special and
private vintage. “What are we
“ What are we to do for Mrs.
Nan?” he repeats, as she does not answer;
" shall we send her out for a blow in the life-
boat? or swing her up the side of a cliff to the
quarries? or—"
Anything on dry land !” she interrupts,
smiling; "but as to watery pleasures”
“ You prefer terra-cotta, as Mrs. L- said !'
pausing to give his family time to laugh at this
fine crusted old jest. “Well, then, terra-cotta
it shall be!"
“I daresay the Lascelles will propose some-
thing,” says Mrs. Mulholland, cheerfully ; “I am
sure that they are dying to see you! I gave

"I do not know what you would do with-
out the Lascelles," cries Pamela, rushing in to
hinder the dreaded accusation from again issu-
ing from the well-meaning lips that so persist-
ently frame it.
“And if you asked the Lascelles," replies the
old gentleman, taking up the remark, “perhaps
you might hear them say that they did not quite
know what they would do without us.”
“Without us," repeats his wife, with a pro-
testing accent. " It is very civil of you to put it
in the plural; but we will not quarrel over who
is the attraction" (with a meaning smile), “ they
really are very kind neighbours to us all, when
they are down here; and they are down a good
deal!"
“And are you down here a good deal ?"
There is a slight pause before the answer
comes: “Oh, we do not move much; we are
very happy at home. Of course Czar goes up
now and again, naturally; but we do not stir
much, it is such a business moving a whole house-
hold so great a distance.”
“I take little bachelor trips up every now
and then," says the old gentleman, with a shrug;

old cronies; and put in an appearance at a ball
or two, to see how my former flames are wear-
ing!”
“ I do not suppose that the ladies thank you
much for that?” says the vulgar young man,
chuckling ; but nobody takes the slightest notice
of him or his remark.
“ This is really too nice!" cries Mrs. Mul-
holland, with a fresh access of good-natured ex-
pansiveness, as the two ladies stand tête-à-tête
over the drawing-room fire. “That I should be
having 'little Nan' under my own roof! You
were short of your age, do you recollect? and
you were so afraid that you were going to be a
dwarf! Do you remember? It was always a
promise that you should stay with me when I
married. How little I thought then” (looking
upwards with fervent and unaffected gratitude)
"what happiness was in store for me!”
“And you really are very happy?" asks
Anne, hoping that her own tones do not sound
as incredulous to her friend as they do to her-
self.
The wife answers by a rapturous smile:
"You see how brilliant he is! and he is always
like that, always, always, even when we are

quite alone! except when he gets out of spirits
from having been here too long, and then I send
him up to London. Of course it would be most
unjustifiable to keep him vegetating here always,
and so we live rather quietly all the year round.
We are not very well off: so that he may do his
little jaunts comfortably in the season."
“ What an unselfish woman you must be!”
She would have liked to have exchanged
this exclamation for its converse-"What a
selfish old pig he must be!” but she refrains.
“ Unselfish !” (with a surprised accent) “ah!
because I have to lose his society for so long;
but then I know he is enjoying himself. He
pretends he does not, but I know that he does.
Of course he is made immensely much of in
London; and we all like to be made much of;
and the children and I are very happy together
here. It is one of my many blessings that his
children like me. Ah, Czar! here you are!” as
the subject of her encomiums, having finished
his special bottle, and grown tired of his son's
and the librarian's company, now joins them.
“We were talking of you.

The old gentleman at once complies with
the first half of the request, sliding his jaunty
body into an arm-chair at his guest's side; but
with the latter half it is little as he suspects it
-quite out of his power to comply, and though
he asks leave to call her Nan, tout court, and
playfully threatens never to answer her unless
she addresses him as “ Czar,” she feels that it is
with a guilty flatness that she responds to his
wife's appeal as they part for the night.
“He is brilliant, is not he?”
“Oh, yes, very," answers she, baldly, “and "
(laughing awkwardly) “I hope you are now
quite disabused of that painful and most errone-
ous idea that I am brilliant, too!”
“You are tired to-night,” replies Char, with
amiable evasiveness ; “but” (shaking her head)
“I have not altered my opinion; it is there still.
It will come out to-morrow." Reiterating that
“it is there still,” and pursued by anguished
assurances from her visitor that it is not, Mrs.
Mulholland retires smiling.
.
Yes, it is all very fine, and of course I am
the gainer,” says Mrs. Bligh next morning after
breakfast, as she and Pamela walk through the
climbing wood that backs the house to reach

the barer hill beyond the view. “But what I
wish to arrive at is why you are not at this mo-
inent in the coster's cart, of which I overheard
at breakfast an almost tearful proffer being
made you."
The girl makes no answer beyond a slight
grimace. Under the trees the Lent lilies are
strewn broadcast, and about their feet are the
creeping ivy and the hyacinth shoots—all the
delightful flooring of an early spring wood!
while through the riot of wild garlic that has
the impudence to look like lily of the valley,
the dogs scampering after a hare make it, by
kissing its leaves, disclose its true nature.
According to Sue, the last time you were
here you were never out of the coster's cart."
“I had nothing better to do! I had not
you! now that I have you” (rapturously).
"Oh, yes” (hastily), “ I understand! or rather"
(laughing) “I do not understand! I suppose,”
says Pamela, thoughtfully, “that one outgrows
people as one outgrew one's clothes when one
was a child. I think I have outgrown George!”
“How long ago?" (in a tone whose dryness
would have satisfied even Mrs. Mulholland)

castic question, but pursues her own line of
thought.
“When one has been used to people all one's
life, I suppose that one is apt to take them for
granted; to accept them, as one accepts one's
self; one no more thinks of criticising them than
one thinks of criticising one's parents; and then
some fine day a lanthorn is turned upon them,
perhaps by some careless remark, uttered by a
person whose opinion one has every reason to
value, and one sees them from thenceforth in
their true colours !"
“And no doubt,” says Anne, with a laugh of
sincere vexation, “one fine day some blabbing
fool will casually observe to you that I am
dreadful bore,' and I shall go to the wall too."
The girl breaks out into eager protestation,
Oh, you! as if there were the slightest parallel;
as if there were the remotest possibility! but”
(slowly) “do not you think that one's standard
may change? that when one's experience is
larger, and one gets a glimpse of what a man
ought to be-"
“ And where have you been getting these
glimpses ?" asks Mrs. Bligh, with a sudden
disagreeable fear of she knows not what.
“Where have you been meeting these giants

manity?"
Oh, nowhere!” answers the girl, in inno-
cent surprise at the sharpness of her compan-
ion's tone ; " you know all my acquaintances;
how humdrum they are! I have not met any-
body in the least interesting all the winter ex-
cept-
But for some perverse
and inscrutable reason
the widow is resolved not to hear the name of
the exception, and she breaks in with an abrupt
remark about the scenery. They have out-
climbed the wood, and are standing in the close
white grass of the hillside which the sheep are
cropping; and where the long-tailed lambs are
skipping over their mother's backs, and leaping
in the air with all four legs off the ground at
once; one engaging black one, like a little dog,
seems leader of their artless games. Out of un-
numbered small brown buds the liberal gorse
flowers are already profusely bursting; their
sweetness guarded by fierce green spikes. Be-
low, the trees of the wood they have just left
are purpling against the sea, and against the
bright, cold, lovely sky.
“What a piece of luck it is for me," exclaims
Pamela, “that that old that Mr. Mulholland

keeps his wife running on his errands all the
forenoon, else I should never have had a chance
of asking you what you think of them all? Did
I give you a good idea of them? of Mrs. Mul-
holland, for instance."
Anne laughs again, and much more naturally
than last time.
“I still fail to see why she is ‘splunchy.''
" And Sue?"
“Sue is an undoubted ‘ripper!""
And Lucille?"
I daresay she is a ripper, too; she looked
like one, as far as I could judge from the very
little I could see of her, under the two dogs and
six people who were sitting upon her!”
“And Mr. Mulholland ?"
They both pause in their walk, and face each
other. There is mirth as well as inquiry in the
younger woman's red-brown eyes, a mirth so
catching that it is reflected in Anne's.
“I am not going to be trepanned into sar-
casms on my host,” she answers, but her voice is
unsteady with laughter as she speaks. “He is a
very nice, civil-spoken old gentleman, and, in-
deed, my dear child" (more gravely), “as he is
our host, you might be a little polite to him."
For a moment or two it seems as though

Pamela were going to receive this remonstrance
in silence, and they both look down at the wood
beneath them, where the still wintry trees have
a sort of uneasy look about them; no hint of
green yet, but the feeling of all the great leaves
encased in the little compass of the restless
buds. Then
“Would you be polite to a person who was
always trying to kiss you on the stairs?” asks
the girl slowly.
“I really cannot face so unlikely a contin-
gency," answers Anne, taken aback. “ But do
you mean—is it possible?-
“He lies in wait for me on the landing, he
pounces out on me from behind doors, he tries
to squeeze my fingers when I hand him his tea-
cup at breakfast,” replies the girl, tragically. “I
think I had better warn you, lest he should at-
tempt anything of the same kind with you!"
“I do not think that in my case there is
much danger," answers Mrs. Bligh, mentally
contrasting the homeliness of her own appear-
ance, of which she is at all times perhaps exag-
geratedly conscious, with the exquisite porce-
lain texture, the fire and dew and carmine of
the young face before her. “But does Char-
does his wife?"

“I think she suspects it, and she does not
like it, poor dear!"--with an accent of disgust
-“she can't like it less than I do! One day I
asked him whether he had ever read Thack-
eray's 'Mrs. Perkins's Ball,' and whether he
had ever met those three attractive old gentle-
men, Lord Tarquin, Lord Methuselah, Lord
Billy Goat. He was so angry!"
“ That was not very surprising."
“ And yet she does not like me to snub him
either!” continues the girl, with a wondering in-
tonation. “Sweet as her temper is, I have seen
her quite put out because she thought I did not
wish to sit by him. Good heavens!”—with an
accent of excessive impatience—“what a hor-
rible thing a love like that is! A love that de-
grades! How earnestly one must hope that
when one's hour comes one will love up,
and
not down."

WELL, and how has Mrs. Nan enjoyed her
constitutional ?” asks the host; one of whose
methods of getting on his guest's nerves is by
speaking of her in the third person; and when
they are all gathering round the luncheon-table
a couple of hours later:“ I was a little hurt at
not being invited to join the party; but you
were quite right-quite right! a pair of young
members of the Alpine Club like you would
soon have distanced such a poor old cripple
as l!"
He pauses to give time for the mirth that
must follow upon this picture of his infirmities,
adding, when the proper dues of merriment
have been paid, “come here, Miss Pamela!"
patting the seat of a chair beside him, “and
give an account of yourself! How have you
been entertaining Mrs. Nan?"
“We went upon the hill,” replies Pamela ;
but, perhaps in deference to her friend's remon-
strance, accepting the seat offered with less
overt rebellion than usual.

“And what did you talk about? From the
little I know of young ladies I do not think two
of them are likely to walk along together in
total silence-ha! ha! Did you discuss us? I
feel sure" (playfully) “that Mrs. Nan was very
cynical, and picked us all to pieces.”
“I am not at all afraid !" replies his wife,
looking round, with a benevolent confidence
that makes both feel rather guilty, at the two
visitors; "not at all afraid of trusting our char-
acters in either of their hands."
“I am not so sure of that. I should like to
have been eavesdropping behind one of our
stone walls as you passed-eh?”
Perhaps it is as well that you were not,”
repiics Anne, daringly; and acting on the
maxim that if you wish to deceive a person the
easiest and surest way is to tell them the exact
truth. “We said some very terrible things of
you!"
They all laugh heartily at the excellence of
this joke, Pamela seeming peculiarly tickled by
it; and then there is a lull, while kind-hearted
little Sue, quite oblivious of her own dinner,
gallops round the table in eager attention to
every one's wants; while the vulgar young
man, with officious assiduity, presses the fami.

members with low-bred ease by their Christian
names.

May I ask, Char, what your plans for the
afternoon are?" inquires the old gentleman pres-
ently, pouring himself out a glass of what
Anne, though perfectly ignorant of wines, di-
vines to be some costly fluid. "I send the serv-
ants away; do not you think I am quite right?
Is not it hard ” (seeing Mrs. Bligh's eyes invol-
untarily fixed on his glass) “that I can't get any
one to help me with my Château Margaux?
Char, I say, what are your plans for the after-
noon?"
“ I thought of taking Nan out in the victoria,
and, of course, it would be very pleasant for
Pamela if you felt inclined to drive her out in
your buggy?”
Anne looks at her friend while she is making
this speech, and, enlightened by her disciple's
confidences of the forenoon, has no difficulty in
interpreting the dual anxiety indicated on the
dial-plate of her good-natured face. A double
and almost contradictory anxiety that her pro-
posal should not be jumped at too eagerly by
one of the parties concerned in it, nor rejected
with too much energy by the other.

“I am afraid I have a pre-engagement !"
replies Pamela, precipitately, for, being be-
tween the devil and the deep sea, she hastens
to throw herself into the embrace of the lat-
ter.
“I believe I am to go out with George in
the coster's cart. I do not think he would like
me to throw him over; why, where is he?"
seeming to become aware for the first time that
his place is empty.
“Oh, how sorry he will be!" cries Sue, her
brother's staunch little bottle-holder and semi-
confidant. “He thought you did not want him,
as you would not go out with him this morning.
So he has taken his gun, and gone to look for a
snipe. He said he would not be back till near
dinner.”
There is an awkward pause, broken by the
young vulgarian saying jocosely, “I am afraid
your coster's cart does not look very healthy!”
and by Mr. Mulholland observing in a resentful
tone, “And I am afraid that, failing the young
gentleman, you will have to put up with the old
one!” The situation is so strained that every
one is relieved when a diversion is made by the
entry of a servant with a note for Mrs. Mul-
holland, which she at once opens, and, having

read, gives utterance to an explanation of dis-
appointment.
“How provoking! I beg your pardon, Nan,
but I asked the Lascelles to dinner for to-morrow
to meet you, and they can't come. Did not you
understand, Czar, that they were not going to
have an Easter party this year? but it seems
they are expecting a man. Lady Lascelles men-
tions him as if I ought to know who he is, but I
never heard of him before to my knowledge-
Sir Robert Coke!” (pronouncing the name as it
is spelt).
"Cook! my dear, Cook!” cries her husband,
correcting her pronunciation with as excruciated
an air as a musician who hears a false note
struck. “ Sir Robert Coke, the sculptor; why,
of course, we all know him! I met him at
Marlborough House last year! If my memory
does not fail me, H. R. H. himself did me the
honour of presenting him to me. I remember
that I talked to him about Marochetti."
Sir Robert Coke ! For the first moment or
two after the piece of news thus conveyed falls
upon her ear, Anne does not look up from the
cold tan muzzle which Lassie, the sheep-dog, has
just laid on her knee, with a little knock to hint
that she is quite willing to share in any of the

refreshments that are going. A repetition of
the uttered name, in a tone of stifled ecstasy
from the other side of the table, makes her lift
her eyes, to meet those of Pamela shooting a
red fire of delight across at her, while a vivid
flash of pleasure heightens the already remark-
able beauty of her colouring. “Good heavens !"
(this reflection comes with a quick shock); the
girl is as pleased at the tidings as she herself
is, or was, a moment ago. And though reason
hastens to assure her that it is on her account
that her votary is so elated, though memory
recalls to her how keenly the girl has identified
herself with her joys and sorrows from the be-
ginning of their acquaintance, yet she mislikes
the colour which is the flag that her joy hangs
out quite as much as Lancelot did
poor
Elaine's."
“Why not ask them to bring him with them?”
suggests the host, after having read the note
which has been passed down the table to him.
“I daresay they would be glad to show him
'that they have neighbours who speak some
language beside Welsh ! and you need not be
nervous, my dear, he is perfectly comme il faut."
“Oh, I do not doubt it! the Lascelles never
have anybody who is not nice; and naturally, if
you met him at Marlborough House"

“He was extremely, remarkably nice to me,

doing some cleverish things.”
“If you know him, Pamela, that is an ad-
ditional reason for asking him," says Mrs. Mul-
holland. “We will put you next him at dinner;
it will be much pleasanter for him than finding
himself among such a set of total strangers as
we all are, will not it, Nan? Is the messenger
gone? Ring, and ask; and I will write at

“ Was there ever anything so exciting ?”
cries Pamela, the moment that she and Mrs.
Bligh are alone, thrusting her arm excitedly
through the widow's, as they both pass along
the corridor to pay the invalid Lucile a visit.
“To think of his having put aside all his work

up in it—to come posting down after you; and
these dear idiots"-with a chuckle of exquisite
amusement—" quite making up their minds that
he is my friend! What a delicious mystifica-
tion! It is almost a pity that we cannot keep it
up a little!”
Anne is saved from the embarrassment of
either assenting to or dissenting from this sug-
gestion, by their having reached Lucile's room.

a sofa, surrounded by drawing-boards, paint-
brushes, and oil colours; and with a spirited lit-
tle oil sketch of two horses pulling hay out of a
manger, on a small easel before her. At her feet
sits Sue, grasping her adored Fezy in her arms.
We must show Sir Robert Coke these, must
not we?" says Pamela, picking up one of the
scattered drawings. “I daresay he will give
you an introduction to the president of the
Blank Exhibition. I am sure he is much too
clever not to see how clever they are. I prophe-
sy”—joyously—“that he will take a particular
fancy to this!”-indicating one.
“ I hope he will not take a particular fancy
to Fezy!” cries Sue, apprehensively, and hug-
ging the little inky chef d'æuvre to her breast.
“If he asks me for him, I shall answer"-assum-
ing a very tragic and dramatic air—“. I will give
you
the skin off my back, but I will not give you
Fezy.''
Her sister laughs. “You know you are so
fond of planning long, high-flown speeches,
which you are never able to deliver when the
time comes. Now, Sue, tell the truth, if you
had to give up me or Fezy, which would it
be?"
Sue hesitates. “Of course "—reluctantly,

“I suppose I should have to keep you, but I
should go and hang myself at once!”
“Oh yes, I know"-derisively—“you would
go and hang yourself just opposite the hall door,
where someone would be sure to come and cut
you down. But”-with a change of key from
this family banter to one of serious interest -
“do you really think that so great a swell would
care to look at my sketches? Sometimes, I
know, the bigger the swell, the kinder. It is
often only the small swells that give themselves
airs, and as he is a friend of yours, you would be
sure to know. He is a friend, isn't he?"
Oh, a devoted friend !” replies Pamela, her
eyes sparkling. “He worships the ground I
tread on.
Is not he coming all the way to An-
glesea to tell me so ?”
“ Is he really?” cries Sue in an awed tone,
while Lucile adds, “ You had better not say any-
thing before Sue that you do not want taken
literally. She is as green as grass !”
Anne has picked up another of the strewn
drawings, and is scrutinizing it with an appar-
ently close attention, of which she is not
aware, until roused by the voice of the young
artist.

so bad, but Czar is wretched ! it does not give
any idea of his charm."
Anne thinks that it would be very odd if it
did, but she only says, “Why do you call him
Czar?"
“He does not like the word father; at least,
he does not like us to call him father, before
people; and you know the Russians call their
Emperor Little Father,' so he asked us would
we mind calling him Czar."
“ I see.” In point of fact, Mrs. Bligh is un-
conscious of what the object before her is in-
tended to represent, with such absent eyes is she
regarding it, while through her mind there
passes the reflection that it is ungrateful not to
be diverted by a jest, invented wholly for your
amusement, and that yet Pamela's mystification
seems to her singularly wanting in the element
of humour. She must be a better actress, how-
ever, than she has ever before had reason to sup-
pose herself; since, in happy ignorance of her
lack of appreciation of the joke, her young ad-
mirer carries it on with unflagging spirit, and
with frequent glances of delighted intelligence
at herself, throughout the rest of that and the
whole of the ensuing day; nor is the expected
stranger ever mentioned by any member of the

family—and in a household not very rich in
events, it occurs somewhat frequently-without
the prefix of “ Pamela's friend.”
“ It seems hardly worth while writing the
names of so small a party,” says Mrs. Mulhol-
land, ambling round the dinner-table, on the
afternoon of the next day, with some strips of
paper in her hand. “But I always think it is
safer, do not you, Nan? People are sure to
shuffle themselves badly if you leave it to them-
selves-”
“Oh, Czar, which is to take me in, Sir
Thomas or Sir Robert? They are both bar-
onets.”
My dear child, I blush for you,” returns
Czar, pulling her ear affectedly. “The Las-
celles' creation dates from 1660, while our poor
Coke is a mere unknown, a toadstool-a toad-
stool of genius, I grant you—ha! ha!-but still
a toadstool!"
“ Then Sir Robert must take Nan," says the
hostess, picking out the two names from her little
bundle. “But then, how shall we manage to put
Pamela near him?"
“He will have to bridle his impatience till
after dinner," replies the old gentleman, with a
rather spiteful smile, “and in the meanwhile

better position than being by the side of the
adored object."
As Mrs. Bligh dresses for dinner, with an
earliness that has a touch of the feverish in it,
one of her causes of hesitating self-congratulation
is, that a period will now surely soon be put to
Miss Capell Smith's rather tiresome joke. She
finds in the drawing - room only her hostess,
who greets her with an exclamation of genuine
surprise that sounds very pleasantly in her
ears.
“Nan, what a metamorphosis! Well, you do
pay
for dressing, as they say. Come to the light,
and let me have a good look at you. I remem-
ber at Madame Reybaud's they used to laugh at
me, but I always said you had great possibilities.
What a charming gown, and what a delightful
pendant! Old, of course. How pretty the little
enamel ribbon tying together the two diamond
hearts! Ah! of course!"-changing her tone to

a more subdued one befitting the lugubrious
theme—“poor Colonel Bligh's hair; reddish,
was it? I always imagined him a dark man.
Czar, come here, and admire Nan! Why, Pa-
mela, you have made yourself smart. Ah, we
all know why,” laughing significantly.
The old gentleman advances alertly, odorous
with white rose.
“I am dazzled," he says, in his usual strain of
florid compliment, putting up his hand to his
eyes. “Char, give me a shade!"
“ Sir Thomas and Lady Lascelles, and Sir
Robert Coke," announces the butler; and “ Ah,
Milady,” cries the host, “punctual to the mo-
ment, and in such a frock! I see"-repeating
his simulation of bedazzlement—"you are deter-
mined to blind a poor old fellow.”
The two ladies exchange civil “So good of
you to come,” and “So good of you to ask us.”
And then it is Anne's turn to be affectionately
presented, as “My dear old school-friend, the
one I have so often told you about, who always
used to make us laugh so.'
The subject of this kindly little memoir would
have been glad to have had the last clause of
the sentence omitted; but she responds to the
easy politenesses that the introduction calls

forth with such composure as is left her by
the consciousness that the sculptor, with his
bright dark eyes flashing under his beautiful
thick grey hair, is at her elbow, waiting his
moment to claim her attention. To-day, at
least, she can accuse him of no laggardness in
greeting her.
The clasp of his hand, at once prompt and
lingering, speaks his real pleasure in the meet-
ing, and in his face she reads a far pleasanter
version of the surprised approbation of her tem-
porary good looks, but lately expressed with so
much naïveté by Char.

Bligh to bear with calmness the breaking into
Coke's first sentence to her of the old host,
with-

our future king-ha! ha! If you remember, I

“ BLESS that dear old gentleman for giving
you to me!” says the sculptor, gently pressing
the hand on his arm against his side, as he
leads Anne to the dining-room ; "what a delight-
ful face he has !"
“ DELIGHTFUL!”
“ Yes, it is so like old Nellie, the ourang-

There is the usual little noise of pulling in
chairs and settling skirts, and Coke naturally
casts a glance round the table, in order to make
the arrangement of which easier, and also be-
cause the master of the house thinks it more
genteel, he and his wife face each other at the
sides; while Mrs. Bligh and the young librarian
occupy the two most prominent positions of
head and foot. From her point of vantage
Anne can command the expression of each of
the eight faces round her; and can, since the
table corner interposes between them, make
surreptitious observations on her neighbour's
countenance with more ease than if she were
alongside of him. Surely, now that Miss Capell
Smith is full in his eye on the host's left hand,
and now that table decorations creep instead of
soaring, he cannot fail to recognize her. But it
so happens that just as his eye takes its care-
less sweep round, her head is averted, perhaps
merely from that tendency which seems invet-
erate in it to present its back to Czar, and
Coke's glance returns unenlightened, unexcited,
and contented to his own lady.
" Talking of having time,” she says, con-
scious if yet quite unable to get rid of that ugly
brusqueness in her tone; "how did you get time

to come here? You assured me it was a sheer
impossibility.”
“Did not you tell me that you were going
to Anglesea ?” he asks; then, seeing a hesitating
and too radiant credulity in her face, he adds,
hastily: “What a terrible woman you are! you
are not only horribly honest yourself, but you
compel a habitually dishonest person like me to
be honest too! I should never, no, never, have
summoned up energy to come"—seeing her face
fall—“ if I had not known you were here; but
the truth is, I had another motive; I was told
that this Welsh fellow had a Porbus in his col.

errand so far. He thinks it is a replica of the
one at the Hague, but it is not. It is a copy,
only I shall not undeceive him; he would turn
me out of the house” (laughing), “and give his
mother's monument to the local stonemason, if
I did."
“That would be a pity!” she says, flatly ;
and he, seeing perhaps a shadow of disappoint-
ment for which he is responsible lying on her
features, cannot refrain from adding, caressing-
ly, “I had such a long, chilly journey to-day,

sea splashing the shore, I should have turned

me that I should find a little friend at the
end ?”
“Did the Prince come to your studio on
Monday?" asks the little friend, precipitately.
Well as he knew her and her abruptness, it al-
ways gives him a cold douche.
“Monday? yes, it was Monday. And Tues-
day?" (recalling the engagements with which
he had parried her unexpressed wish for an-
other sight of him before her departure).
“ Did you go down into the country and
make more sketches of Rayon d'Or?”

whole face lighting up with an eager delight,
which, as she reflects, no thought of her or
relish of her society has ever been able to call
into it. “I had a glorious day of it. I had him
out into a meadow, and ran by his side as he
was trotting, galloping, and sometimes rear-
ing!”

“I promised the groom half-a-crown a rear,

and brain to catch a particular instant which
shows how the four legs can at one moment be
in relation to each other is immense; but”-
with that recurring lighting of the eye—“it is a
delightful kind of fatigue! And how one sleeps
after it! Like a tired hound!"
Her intelligent face kindles with sympathet-
ic interest, and yet a light pang shoots through
her. Is it possible that she is jealous even of
his work?
“ You will be able to get on swimmingly
now then," she says, with keen relish, “ without
any more of those hitches and delays that have
chafed you so much."
He sighs. “No such luck! There are half-
a-dozen dead people between me and him! You
know I was telegraphed for last week to take

with a slight shudder of disgust—"like a dead

choly, which for the moment he believes to be
perfectly genuine, though there may possibly
be in it a dash of what in a woman would be
called coquetry. “Do you think me to be con .
gratulated for having struck no roots any-
where?"
“What has become," she asks, shying away
from this vaguely agitating question, “ of the
imaginative work that your heart seemed so
set upon, whose subject we so often discussed
in Dorsetshire ?"
He smiles with good-humoured indulgence
at her vehemence, thinking the while that he
wished she would get out of temper oftener,
since the effect is so greatly to enhance her
physical attractions.
“ Did not I tell you that I was to do a fount-
ain for old Lady —? I only accepted it on
the condition that I should have carte blanche

“ What must she think of me for not
having known her before?” returning, with
what his friend thinks an unnecessary empresse-
ment, the hesitating smile and bow, lovely in
their rosy shyness, which the young girl throws
him across the board. Not very happily placed
herself between the host and the young vulga-
rian, she has been watching with the deepest in-
terest the two persons on the opposite side of
the table, and forming absorbed conjectures as
to the subject of their conversation from the
motion of their lips. “Did I ever know her
name? or have I forgotten it?” asks Coke, in
a low voice, of his neighbour. “Tell me what
it is; but speak low, for she is pricking those
little shelly ears!”
“ Her name is Smith.” It would have been
generous to add the graceful prefix of “ Pamela.”
But there are moments when generosity is
difficult.
“I wish she would sit for my Nereid," still
surveying the girl with the openness of perfect
innocence of heart. “I would put her on a sea-
horse, with her dear little dimpled hands twist-
ed in his mane.” Then, seeing no particularly
avid acceptance of this suggestion in the usual-
ly keenly sympathetic face of his neighbour, he

adds more seriously: “Do you think, dear
friend, that you can be more anxious for me
than I am for myself, to get away from Jewry
into the upper air? Do you think that I enjoy
seeing my studio"—with a gesture of disgust-
“fast becoming a necropolis ?”
“ Then why do you let it? Why do not you
get away?" asks she, bluntly.
The question is, perhaps, not an easy one to
answer; and her downright earnest eyes make
him uncomfortable, for his reply is to change
the subject.
“Ought not I"-lowering his voice—" to
say something to the good lady on my right?
She is my hostess, and though you ”—with an
affectionate smile—“have a way of making me
forget every one else when I am talking to you,
yet I suppose I ought to say five words to her,
oughtn't I?”
“Of course you ought," answers she, shortly;
and instantly turns away her head, to show that
she makes no further claim on his attention.
She can't avoid overhearing the rather nerv-
ous apology for not having placed him near his
supposed intimate, with which Mrs. Mulholland
opens the conversation ; but in order to avoid
catching his courteous, if rather puzzled, re.

joinder, she herself rushes into talk with the
sulky George, who, hitherto wholly neglected
by her, now sits looking straight before him,
eating his dinner in morose silence.
Did you get many snipe?”
"Only one."
“You had better”—conciliatingly—“ have
stayed at home, and driven out Pamela in the
coster's cart."
No answer.
“When you go out together, which drives,
you or she? and do you stand up like real
costers ?”
“ We sit down.”
“How extremely well she is looking to-
night!”
“ Is she?” Then, casting a glance of resent-
ful indifference in her direction—"I think her
very much over-dressed."
Mrs. Bligh pauses, baffled, reflecting a little
cynically, how thankful she would have been if
the angry young gentleman beside her had, on
the occasion of Lady St. George's luncheon,
treated her to his present irate silence. But be-
ing a good-hearted woman, conscious of having
unintentionally done him an injury, and, strong-
est motive of all, being determined not, by look-

ing neglected, to seem to claim a return of
Coke's notice, she perseveres.
“ You would not like her to come down to
dinner in a tweed tailor gown?" she asks, not
because she supposes that he or any other living
being could nourish so senseless a desire, but be-
cause she is resolved to keep saying something.
And before the tardy reply to her idiotic query
can come, she hears a voice softly saying at the
back of her head-
“I have done my duty. Come back to me!”
For the rest of dinner young Mr. Mulholland
is at liberty to sulk at ease.
“Well ?" cries Pamela, in a voice of delight-
ed expectation, sliding her arm under the
widow's, and detaining her with gentle force in
the hall before letting her enter the drawing-
room after dinner.
“Well!” answers Anne, with an embarrassed
laugh.
“I do not think I can keep up my mysti-
fication much longer, can I?”—with a pleased
chuckle. “Even they will see through it. What
an interesting face he has! What a play of feat-
ures! You had a delightful dinner.”
" It is more than you had, I am afraid.”
“Oh, I did not mind! The old satyr"-

and I was quite, quite happy watching you two!

word you said! I would not for worlds have
tried! How determined he was "—again laugh-
ing delightedly—“ that you should not waste
any words upon that stupid George; and he
was perfectly right. It would have been casting
pearls before swine. Do you know "--growing
grave—“I am afraid that George has not at all
a nice nature; I think he is very vindictive.”
“ Poor George! I do not know why he visits
your misdeeds upon me.”
“I was thinking at dinner that I wondered
why it had never struck me before what a very
bad countenance he has !”
“ Poor George! You know”—playfully-
“ love is always as unbecoming to a man as it is
becoming to a woman."
“ It is not unbecoming to some men,” replies
Pamela, with a significant shake of her lovely
head; and though Anne is well aware that the
state of mind alluded to has nothing in common
with the relations between herself and the sculp-
tor, yet the baseless implication quickens her
pulses.

Perhaps the little effervescence of spirits pro-
duced by the suggestion helps her to bear the
trial in store for her, when, upon the entry of the
men, her host throws himself with juvenile agil-
ity on a pouf at her feet, declaring that, “what-
ever happens, Mrs. Nan must not be neglected,”
while, with eyes at the back of her head, she
sees the eager courtesy with which Sir Robert
Coke is making his apologies to Pamela, and the
rosy alacrity with which they are received.
But to-day Mrs. Bligh's star is in the ascend-
ant, for whether or not nettled by the absence
of manner with which she responds to his in-
quiries as to “who built that killing frock,” the
old gentleman presently springs with scarcely
any difficulty to his little patent leather feet,
and leaves her. And then-
“ Is he coming back?” asks a voice at her
elbow.

She hitches her chair unconsciously a shade
nearer his.
“Let us talk of
your
work!"
“Let us ”—with a shrug—"not talk of my
work! When you look through me with your
gimlet eyes, and ask me in your trenchant voice
when I am going to do something imaginative,
you make me feel such a shabby fellow; you
make me blush for my pot-boilers! I do not like
feeling shabby; I do not like blushing !”
She is silent.
“Now if”—with a sigh—“I had someone al-
ways at my elbow to pull me by the sleeve, and
point me with her little emphatic forefinger to
the stars, I might do something—I do not say
that it is likely, but I might.”
She has dropped her eyes, conscious that
they are growing wistful. Mrs. Bligh has not
had much happiness in her life, and it has
seemed to her that the sufferings which she has
been called upon to bear have been of a kind to
sour and not ripen.

turn nearer hers, and passing his hand through
his hair_“I have an idea that I think would

thread of their talk being so rudely broken, he
should not care any longer to keep his place be-

“Well, it really went off very well,” says
Mrs. Mulholland, as the door closes on the
guests, speaking with that air of unaffected
comfort and relief with which we mostly salute
our friends' backs; “and I quite like Sir

“And I like him too, awfully," cries Sue,
still in her bardish wig and beard, which have
veered a good deal to one side in her plunge.
“He asked me how many prizes Fezy had

you detest back-hair talks; but”—putting her
arm round her friend's waist, and looking close-

her own-"you have enjoyed yourself to-night,

“Like the sign of the Rising Sun on a pot-
house!” replies Anne, half laughing, half grate-
ful, and yet vexed with herself for having worn
her heart so openly on her sleeve for even the
most friendly daw to peck at.
“ You always ludicrously underrate your
own attractiveness ; but to-night you must know
that you are looking radiant! I know now how

Lucille's convalescence. It is made sotto voce,

among them.

Sue and the dogs skirmishing on the flanks,
and the rear brought up by the two elders.
On the spirit of the woman, despite the
delightfulness of this arrangement, there rests
a slight cloud. She wishes that it had not
come about through Pamela's management-
wishes it without knowing why, and with the
slight but chilling dread superadded that he
may think her too obviously assigned to him,
in the disposition of the little party. He cer-
tainly shows no signs of so doing as he steps
out actively beside her along the stony upland
road with an air of vigorous enjoyment, asking,
in a voice that keeps that gay holiday touch
in it-
“Where are we going? Not that I shall
be much wiser when you have told me.”
“To Red Wharf Bay.”
“So called because the sands are yellow,”
cries Pamela, with a jolly laugh, throwing the
explanation over her shoulder, and giving the
fat pony a flick

a rocky road over moorland, between stone
walls. Coke has taken off his hat, and with
inflated nostrils, parted lips, and dilating eyes,
seems imbibing through the channel of every
sense the large brightness of the spring sky.
“What light?" he says, enviously; “what
might not one do if one had light such as this?
Is not our want of light in itself enough to
account for the difference between our work
and theirs ? I mean the bigwigs in our line.

nounced dissent). I wonder shall I ever grow
to love the 'sweet security' of Tite Street ?”
They have reached the highest point of the
rising ground they have been breasting, and
now stop to breathe and look back at sea and
Snowdon hills. A good deal of snow must have
fallen during the night. What was rain here,

and Carnedd David are closelier wrapped than
they were yestereven. The clouds are trying
different dispositions of their shadows every
moment on crag and slope, and the light is
darting in between and making little meadows
of white brightness beside the hard purple lines.
All around them as they stand the gorse is
blossoming and scenting the brisk air.
“And you would cut your throat if you lived
in the country?” says Anne, with an accent of
regret at a confession which seems to open such
a gulf between them, and a loving look at the
smiling Welsh hills. “I daresay you would
agree with a friend of mine about mountains.
She said she could not bear to live among them;
she felt about them as one does when people
will stand too near one, a desire to push them
away, and bid them keep their distance. But
then" (reflectively) "she had always lived in a
flat country.”
“ Yes?"
“ It was the country I used to live in," her
voice involuntarily sinking, and her clear eye
darkening, as always when memory approaches
her painful past; "there was not a molehill
within sight. I used to walk every day along a
road as flat as a pancake three miles out and

three miles in. I used to stop and look over
that same gate into the same field.”
“Poor little friend !” (very sympathetically)
-“all alone?”
“How else? Oh, I did hate that road! the
doctors used to drive me out; they said I
should break down if they did not. I do not
believe I should. I can see that field now: one
year it had mangolds, and another swedes; and
in the winter it was almost always under water.”
“ Poor little friend !”
The ejaculation is meant to be fully as com-
passionately affectionate as on the first occasion;
but Anne's ear seems to detect a flavour of
absence about it, and her eyes, hitherto averted,
snatching a sharp glance at him, reveal the fact
that, with the best intentions in the world, he is
giving her narrative but a divided attention.
The explanation is not far to seek. The pony
chaise has been drawn up at about 100 paces
ahead of them, and Pamela, Sue, and George
have taken out their pocket-knives and cut
sprigs and boughs of the lavishly blooming
furze. Pamela has stuck a gold spike in the
front of her sailor hat. The idea is caught by
the others and improved upon. George sticks
a second sprig in, then a third, till she has a

whole crown of rich gold. Sue must have one
too. Then Pamela, invention growing, demands
a sprig for each button-hole of her blue home-
spun cloak; so does Sue for her dapple-gray ;
while Lucile, from the chaise, clamours to be
equally decked. One makes herself a yellow
rosette for each neat shoe ; another will not be
distanced. Then they dress out the pony, or-
namenting headpiece and harness, and shafts ;
and then-sufficient reason for the sculptor's ab-
straction-Pamela comes flying with her pretty
pricked fingers full of odorous yellow tributes
to decorate her friend too. But the friend will
have none of them ; and says so, with a trench-
antness which brings up a little cloud of dis-
appointed surprise over the radiant carnation of
the girl's cheek, and causes Coke to strike in
with a hasty, playful appeal, in which Anne's
jealous ear seems to detect a rebuke to herself.
“Am I to be left out? I, who love finery?
Make me as fine as you can," holding out hat
and coat lapel.
He will not be content till, as in the case of
her own cloak, every button-hole has its flaming
glory. An exclamation from the direction of
the pony-chaise alone brings the toilette to an
end. The large gorse branch, which has been

stuck in over the pony's forehead, naturally is
not long in pricking its ears, and with a shake
of its head off it starts. George grabs at the
reins, which have been chucked carelessly on
its back, wo-a-ing lustily to it to stop, and the
others, reinforced by Miss Capell Smith, and,
alas! by the sculptor, shouting with happy fun,
scamper after. The runaway, being much too
fat and mature in years to enjoy violent exercise
for its own sake, is soon brought to a standstill;
but by this time they are all in such a fine glow
of spirits that they wish for a repetition of the
race. Pamela gets into the chaise with Lucile,
though there is really only room for one. Sue
snatches the reins out of George's hand, and
mischievously “te-ling” up the pony, away
they go down a steep pitch, galloping and
screaming; half-frightened, half-delighted, over
jolting new-laid stones, over the wayside grass.
One side of the Bath-chair up, the other down;
hovering over the edge of a ditch, nearly in it,
rescued by a timely jerk of the reins on the
brink. At the bottom of the hill they stop-at
least they try to do so; but the impetus given
them by their rush carries them halfway up
the next incline before they can really pull up.
They are at a standstill at last, and ex-

changing inquiries, ejaculations, and reproach-
es, breathless and almost unintelligible from
laughter. The sculptor is the first to regain his
gravity, and with a half-shamefaced look goes to
meet his late companion, who, alone uninfected
by the general frolicsomeness, and yet reproach-
ing herself for not having caught it, is soberly
descending the steep pitch which the Bacchic
rout had but now rolled and tumbled down in
such childish glee.
“No wonder you are curling your lip at us!”
says Coke, half deprecatingly, and yet still with
that frisky ring in his voice.
“ Indeed, I am doing nothing of the kind! I
know that boys will be boys."
It is meant for a jest, which indeed it is.
Nor is he at all less conscious than she that he
came of age the year she was born. But no
man of fifty, however little he may play at
youth, enjoys a feer, even a sportive one, at his
age. A sort of annoyed blush skims over his
mobile face as he answers, without ill-humour,
but also without the holiday tone of his former
sentence-
“ That is a very just rebuke!"
“ It is not a rebuke!” cried she, eagerly, too
late repenting of her waspish pleasantry. “It

is a plain statement of fact: in myself I am
years older than you. I never had the chance
of being young when I was young, and now it
is too old to begin.”
He has resumed his place at her side, and
has dropped into a pace as staid as hers, while
the rest of the cortege gets into motion again,
and moves on demurely now ahead of them.
"If you had had my life," she goes on in a
key of almost pathetic appeal, as he answers
her paradoxical assertion only by a gentle head-
shake, “ you would wonder that I am not even
more morose and fractious than I am.”
“When you took those dreary walks, and
looked over that gate at the mangolds!”
She feels that this careful repetition of her
words is to prove to her how well he had
listened.
« Yes."
“And you were quite alone? Had not even
a dog?”
“Not even a dog; it was out of the question
for me to have a dog. He could not have
borne its barking."
“And that went on for-how long ?”
The pause before the last two words implies
a reluctant admission that he has forgotten the

aware that it is not the first time she has con-
fided it to him.
“Eight years!”
Eight years !” his mind wandering back
over the corresponding period of his own life-
years of engrossing work, growing fame, swell-
ing fortune.
“One would have thought that in such a life
I might at least have cultivated my mind, have
absorbed a good deal out of books; but even
that was quite out of the question. I never
could count upon an unbroken quarter of an

persuade even him; he often said, You poor
soul, how pleased you will be when I am
dead!' and at last I only answered, · Yes, shall
not I?'"

a little at fault.
“Two years, but that first year does not
count. I cannot remember how it passed. I
think I must have been dead too, and then I
came to life again, and then I went abroad, and
then I took a house in Tite Street, and then "
--her tone lightening, and her face breaking
into smiles-" I met a lion in a Dorsetshire
snowstorm. You see," between jest and earnest,
"you have been the culminating point of my
life's history!”
“What should I have done without

In another key, “ That ab-
surd girl! what a madcap she is! She will

He quickens his pace as he speaks, and
comes up again with the Bath-chair, round
the brow of whose patient steed Miss Pamela
is again arranging her aureole of painful gold,
in the obvious hope of pricking him up into a
second spurt of artificial liveliness. It is only
with great difficulty, and after a lively wrangle,
that she is dissuaded. That wrangle, during
which Mrs. Bligh, standing a little apart, looks
at the view, combined with their previous

dawdling, has made them so late that they
never get to their proposed destination after
all. They turn back before they reach the bay,
which they see and hear creaming and gently
singing with its sheltered succession of crescent-
shaped billowlets below them, in the sunlight.
Now and then a pompously threatening dark
rain-cloud sails up and shakes out three sprayey
drops from its skirts upon them; but it is
quickly driven off seawards, before it can even
damp them.
They return in a different order from that
in which they came, though that is not the fault
of the sculptor, who would be well content to
drop behind again with his ally; and while his
artist eye is pleased by the graceful antics of
the young girls ahead of him, reward Mrs.
Bligh's confidence by that intimate talk about
himself and his work, which to a man of his
stamp, and in the case of a thoroughly trusted
and warmly-liked woman, is such a genuine en-
joyment. But Anne keeps so persistent a hold
of one side of the Bath-chair, and talks with
such a frenzy of determination to its inmate,
that after one or two oblique efforts to induce
her to detach her grip, he desists. He does his
best even then by making a pendant to her on

the other side, and shooting remarks at her
across the convalescent. But it is not the same
thing as on the outward journey; and once
again he feels that sense of chill and repulse
which her unaccountable snubbings and short-
nesses have before inspired him with.
And yet he must have thought the excursion
a success, for next day, when they repeat it, he
is again one of them. It is unlikely that Sir
Thomas Lascelles is a second time to be made
a bard, but yet his guest again manages to
elude his hospitality; on what pretext they
none of them-since all are glad to have him-
too curiously inquire. They go to Penmaen
to-day to see a ruined priory, and a lighthouse
beyond it; and either because they have more
fixity of purpose, or the weather—it is a colour-
less uniform day, like a dull man's mind-holds
out less temptation to loiter, they do really ar-
rive at their promised point in this case. Un-
like yesterday, their road runs at first sheltered
between hedges, high hedges, where the new
brown buds of the quickset hedge show against
patches of monotonous evergreen, then out on
an exposed and sea-washed tract of sedgy land,
over which the tide must once have rolled, and
where now the gorse lights its yellow fires; up

to Penmaen, where a painfully newly restored
church, with fresh pointed bricks, contrasts the
graceful decay of the ruined walls of the ancient
monastery, in whose roofless enclosures chickens
stroll, and along whose face an enormously old
ivy tree stretches like an apricot on a garden
wall. Up a steep pitch, over a blowy hill,
whose fine grass is nibbled down by rabbits, of
which this green slope is a warren, down, down
to where the black and white lighthouse stands,

which at flow foams so high around it. In the
watches of the past night Anne has taken her.
self seriously to task for her conduct during the
Red Wharf Bay excursion; for her stupid and
surly want of confidence in her friend and his
liking; for her lack of spring and of sympa-
thetic gaiety. To her pillow she has made
many a penitent vow, that if Fate gives her an-
other chance, she will be more cheerful, more
skittish, more in tune with her surroundings.
A playfulness, de commande, is not as a rule
worth much; but hers is happily not put to a
very severe test, as on this second trip the level
of spirits of the whole party is distinctly less
boisterously high than on the former one.

note, is for some reason in a soberer vein, and
walks along so steadily and with a demureness so
gentle-gentle even to the discarded George-
that the latter is emboldened to offer her timidly
a little rabbit's skull, bleached and bare, which
he has picked up, and of which he surrepti-
tiously keeps back the lower jaw; and when
the odd present is carelessly accepted, half fur.
tively hides his portion in his pocket. The
elders, following in the rear, witness the little
transaction.
" That is the oddest love-token I ever saw,”
says Coke, laughing. “ He had better have
given it to Fezy; he would have appreciated it
more."
“ Would he?” with interest. “ There! I
told you! She has dropped it already. Why
do you pick it up?" (as he stoops to retrieve
the castaway love-gift).
Why? I do not know; I suppose because
I never can help a sneaking tenderness towards
anything or anybody that is dropped."
“You certainly ought to have a tenderness
for young Mulholland then, since there is no
doubt as to her having dropped him."
“ Has she? Well, I know it is inconsistent,
but I am glad of that."

Why?" (a little breathlessly).
“Why! Oh, because” (indifferently), “if.
people must be mated, I do not myself see any
necessity ; but if they must, I think it is as well
that they should not be mismated. I never can
quite pardon Shakespeare for having given
Celia to Oliver, or Hero to that sweep Claudio!"
“I expect that a good many of Shakespeare's
couples were not very happy in their married
life,” replies Mrs. Bligh, thoughtfully. “I am
not very sure about even Benedick and Bea-
trice; Oliver of course beat Celia. I am afraid
that Angelo and Mariana led but a cat-and-dog
life; and I must say I hope that Bertram paid
out Helena for having entrapped him. I never
could bear Helena."
“No? and yet she is the mouthpiece for some
of the sweetest sayings about love that Shake-
speare ever uttered.
Ah, here we are. How
would you like to live in a lighthouse, madam?"
“George has gone for the key,” cries Sue,
sending her childish voice down the sea-wind to
them. We are all to go inside, and the man
is to show us the resolving light.”
“Of course you need not come,” says Pa-
mela, approaching her friend, the red light in her
eyes as bright with expectation as Sue's" resolv.

ing" one can be. “That is if you had rather
not; nor you either," waving a little hazel wand,
lately cut by George out of a hedge for her,
in the direction of Coke, to show that she
means him.
“Of course I shall come,” replies Anne
stoutly, with a hurried recollection of her mid-
night resolve to be not outdone in youth or
enterprise, even by Sue or Fezy. “How easy it
looks—only those three little steps !”
But the three little steps, like many other
things in life, wear a very different aspect when
looked at close, from that which they present
when seen from a distance. The lighthouse is
reached now at low tide by a path made of three
narrow planks laid abreast, and furnished with
an iron handrail; and when this is passed, and
the base of the structure reached, Mrs. Bligh
perceives how razor-edged, how slippery, how
strait, the steps which from the hill had looked
as easy of ascent as the perron of a Georgian
country-house really are. Her heart fails her,
and, despite Sue's earnest adjuration and hand-
some offer, “Oh, do come, I will push you from
behind very hard ; and then if
hard ; and then if you fall I shall be
killed too!” she lets the young ones—though
with a slight heart-pinch at the thought of her

own oldness and want of agility-go without
her. Coke stays beside her—at least he really
meant to do so; and together they amusedly
watch the little girl crawling up first, holding
tight on to the rail on each side, while her closely
following brother restrain her brief petticoats
from indulging a lively impulse to fly over her
head. She has reached the top in safety, and
now it is Pamela's turn. She is generally dar-
ing and hardy enough, but now she hesitates.
“ If you hold me down as tightly as you did
Sue,” she says, eying her expectant squire with
unveiled distrust," I shall not be able to move
my legs at all !"
"I seem never to be able to do anything
right of late," he answers affronted; and turning
on his heel begins to retrace his steps across the
slippery planks to where the Bath-chair and
Lucille are waiting on the hillside. Pamela on
her part makes a feint of attempting the ascent
unaided ; but it is so evident a one, and the
young man's lagging retreat partakes so ob-
viously of the same character, that it is apparent
to the meanest understanding that necessity on
one side and tenderness on the other will, if they
are left to themselves, soon effect a rapprochement
between the couple. There is not the smallest

need for any one else to interfere, and yet Mrs.
Bligh does so. The sculptor is leaning over the
rails, his attention strayed away from the
squabbling youth and maiden, listening pleased
to the sea song, and looking at the rocklets be-
low him, all covered with the little bladders of
the coarse yellow-brown sea-tang, and the much
more delicate briny weeds that live in the mimic
pools and hollows left by the tide. He is fanci-
fully likening them to land things : the pink
ones to sea-heather, the green to meadow grass,
when his friend's voice breaks into his reverie:
Ought not you to go to the rescue?”
She makes the suggestion : firstly, because
she has a perfectly groundless suspicion that he
wishes it; and secondly, because she herself had
very much rather that he did not.
“ The rescue!” he answers, with a quite
genuine slight start. « Whose rescue? Oh! I
By all means."
Two minutes later, Pamela, flushed and with
wind-loosened hair, is blowing kisses to Anne
from the lighthouse doorway, up to which she
has been skilfuly, swiftly, and lightly piloted,
and then with her guide disappears in the inte.
rior. Mrs. Bligh rests her arms on the rails as
nearly as possible in the same spot as that lately

occupied by Coke, tries to look at exactly the
same seaweed, and to catch the train of thought
they have suggested to him. As she does so, an
undisguisedly angry voice sounds in her ear:
“I see you are my enemy still." She does
not answer young Mulholland, but to her own
heart she says, “Not nearly so much as my
own."

CHAPTER IX.
THE Mulholland family no longer made
company of Anne, as is apparent by the free-
dom with which on the evening following the
Penmaen trip, they are pursuing their usual
course of every-day occupation and rough fam-
ily jokes. The only exception is the head, who
is trying to read his Morning Post without
glasses by holding the paper at an immense dis-
tance from his eyes, and has just snubbed the
objectionable librarian for an officious offer to
seek his spectacle-case for him; but, like most
under-bred persons, this one is quite unsnub-
bable, and only follows up his proposal by a jo-
cose anecdote of some other elderly gentleman
who was supposed to have said, “ My sight is as
good as ever, I only want my arm lengthened.”
It is received with a frozen silence, but its
author goes on chuckling over it for several
minutes. Lucile in the tearing spirits of young
convalescence and Sue are having a quite noisy
scuffle, which neither of their parents appears

to hear, and the object of which is on Lucile's
part the snatching away and on Sue's the reten-
tion of a half-written letter addressed by the lat-
ter to a correspondent, and which the elder sis-
ter is mischievously anxious to read aloud for
the diversion of the company. The war, ren-
dered unequal by the fact that Lucile is still
supported by a stick, is being waged with un-
certain fortune until George decides its issue
by unexpectedly filching the contested docu-
ment out of the hands of both combatants, and
reading it out in a loud, level voice over their
heads. “There are two very curous bridges
here, one is a suspention bridge, the other is a
tubibular bridge, because it resembles a gigan-
tic tobe.” The little scribe's family burst into a
roar of laughter, while she herself hovers be-
tween giggles and tears, crying-
“Oh, Czar, you too! you are unkind!”
“I am sure you do not mean that, Sue!”
strikes in the librarian perkily. “I know that
you think your pappy a dear, kind old gentle-
man!
In a second everybody stops laughing.
“ You are looking pale, Nan!” says the
hostess; “We must not let these young luna-
tics tear you to pieces; they forget that

you are not quite the same age as them-
selves!"
This imputation on her juvenility leaves its
object calm, but her young disciple reddens
with indignation.
“ If people are all young together, I do not
see that a year or two makes much difference.
I am sure we were all, one as young as another,
to-day.”
• Including our poor Coke?” suggests Czar
with a sneer.
“Yes, including our poor Coke'” (sturdily)
-"
“of course that is a joke, he is not young, and
he does not pretend to be, but Anne is
young!”
“Of course she is! your birthday is the 20th
of February, Nan, is not it? I remember it be-
cause it came between Constance Fletcher's and
Laura Wilde's. I have quite lost sight of Con-
stance, and someone told me that Laura had
gone to the bad. I hope it is not true.”
She expresses this hope with an air of such
absolute snug indifference that Mrs. Bligh
smiles, but does not answer, because her atten-
tion is at this moment claimed by the sight of
Fezy, whom she now sees standing on the
hearthrug shaking her lace pocket-handkerchief

like a rat. He has stolen it out of her pocket
so softly that she has not till now become aware
of her loss.
“ Isn't he clever?” cries his little owner,
ecstatically, “ he always goes to the right side
because he knows that people have their pock-
ets on the right side. Oh, I do hope he has not
done it much harm!”
This unlikely aspiration is so far from be-
ing realised that Mrs. Bligh's sole course is
good-naturedly to reassure the little girl by tell-
ing her that it is only her second-best pocket-
handkerchief; and to make over the wreck to
George, who, anxious to display in turn the ac-
complishments of his own favourite, makes it
up into an improbable mouse and throws it to
the end of the long room for Jim the terrier to
pursue and worry, which he does with such ar-
tistic thoroughness as to throw poor Fezy's tal-
ents into the shade. Conscious of this, mad
with mortification and envy, yet too cowardly
to dispute the prize, the tiny performer lies
eclipsed in an arm-chair, easing his feelings by
a short, angry bark each time that the small
damp ball and the scampering terrier's feet
slither together over the parquet.

says Mrs. Mulholland, taking advantage of a
war of words which has arisen between the dog.
owners, and in which Pamela has been called in
as umpire; “but of course I know that it is
only good-nature, and so I told Lady Lascelles
to-day, when she came to arrange about the
visit to the Quarries for Monday; she made
rather a point of having you, but I really do not
see why, when you have come here to enjoy
yourself, you should be made use of to entertain
other people's guests."
If there is any gratification to be derived
from this speech by the person to whom it is
addressed, it lies in the evidence it affords of
how very much better she must have disguised
her sentiments than is usually possible to her.
But her satisfaction, such as it is, does not
hinder her saying resolutely, though with a
laugh,

it. I am sure you would be much happier at
home with Czar and me."
· Pray do not include me," cries he huffily;
upon my word, our friend Coke, for a man
who is supposed to have come down here pro-
fessionally, is taking it pretty coolly; here to-
day, there to-morrow. I fail to see where the
business comes in."
“He has spent the whole of each morning
in making sketches and taking measurements
for the monument in the church," says Anne,
picking up the cudgels for her absent friend,
and calling herself a fool for doing so; "and ap-
parently Sir Thomas is satisfied with him, as he
now wishes him to do also a bust of Lady Las-
celles.”
“H’m! I wonder how many more effigies of
herself that dear little lady will have before she
is content!"
“A bust of Lady Lascelles !” cries his wife
in a tone of lively interest. “I wonder she
never mentioned it when she was here to-day!
I daresay she was afraid of your chaffing her;
you know you are a little satirical sometimes to
her, though she is a great favourite. Oh,

wish that you would sit to him! Have you any

idea"—to Anne—"what his charge is? and
would he make a reduction in the case of a par-
ticularly good subject.”
“I have not an idea," with an inward smile,
given to the recollection of Coke's delighted
comparison of his host's face to that of old Nel-
lie, the ourang-outang. “I believe-I imagine
—that his price would be about £ 500!”
* £500!”—this from Czar~"do you mean
to say that he has the conscience to ask £500
for a mere bust, just head and shoulders? I
like his effrontery! Why, Marochetti him-
self-"
But what Marochetti himself either did, or
did not, will never now be certainly known, for
at this juncture there arises a hideous clamour
of dogs and men. It springs from the fact that
at one last supernatural bound of the pocket-
handkerchief mouse, and capture of it by Jim,
Fezy loses all self-control, and casting prudence
to the winds, leaps from his arm-chair, and flies
at the terrier. The latter unhesitatingly retorts
by a very sincere nip into the beautiful black ja-
bot under his little chin ; while Lassie-always
a rather underhand character-seeing here
good opportunity of paying off old scores, plants
her teeth in the happily thick silk of his nape.

All their owners at once hurl themselves into
the fray; and amid a mingled din of howls,
growls, tears, and smacks, the evening ends.
When Monday comes it is apparent that the
energy of Mrs. Bligh's assertion of her wish to
visit the slate quarries has been of service to
her, since no more efforts at dissuasion are
made. She sets off accompanied by reiterated
hopes from her host that she may enjoy herself ;
uttered in a tone which plainly shows how as-
sured he is that she will not. His family leave
him, making ostentatious and unnecessary-
since he had not been invited-actions of thanks-
giving that he is not of the party. The third of
any series ought always to be the best; and
surely their third and crowning excursion, ex-
ceeding the previous ones so far in scope and
ambition, must exceed them proportionately in
enjoyment too. It opens auspiciously. Sir
Thomas drives his own coach; but in thought-
ful deference to a dislike; carelessly expressed
on a previous day by Anne for that form of con-
veyance, a victoria has been provided for her;
and in that victoria it is soon clear that the
sculptor is meant to be her companion. She
fancies that he looks surprised at the arrange-
ment, and at once asks him in her shortest

voice whether he would not rather go on the
coach ? He answers her—as how can he help
doing—and with every appearance of veracity
that he had rather not; and seats himself beside
her, with an expression of complete, if not ec-
static, content.
“Now we are going to enjoy ourselves,” he
says, in a tone of easy playfulness, that yet to
her ears conveys a very gentle admonishment.
“We are going to stroke each other's fur the
right way the whole day, and not say anything
that is not perfectly pleasant to one another, for
who knows when we shall have the chance of
another ride together in a one-horse shay? Are
you agreed?"
“Do you wish me to commit perjury?" she
asks; but her voice is no longer short, and she
smiles.
It is an uncertain blowy day: now brilliant,
now sulky; the sea, a mere dark sheet a mo.
ment ago, suddenly covered all over with silver
scales. By the side of the charming Straits
they pass, across the noble Menai Bridge, since
the quarries lie in Carnarvonshire. Coke is ob-
viously inclined to be silent, and, despite his an-
nouncement of a determination to enjoy himself,
apparently somewhat out of spirits. His corn-

panion's anxious desire to discover the cause
shapes itself by-and-by into the query,
“ You are really going back to London to-
night?”
“Yes; I shall catch the night mail at Ches-
ter."
“You are glad to go?"
“To any other woman I should, of course,
say “No;' but to my conscience”-with a look
of affectionate confidence—“I may indulge my-
self in the luxury of speaking truth. I am
glad. I can't work with comfort anywhere but
in my studio. I can't sleep in a strange bed. I
miss my violent ride in the Park in the morn-
ing. I suppose ”—with a smile—“that I am
like an old watch, which after a good shaking
goes again!"
Until the candour of this answer disabuses
her, Mrs. Bligh had not realised how much
of hope had lurked in her mind that the sculp-
tor's depression owed its cause to the ending of
his rural holiday.
“ You have not seen my new horse,” he
pursues—a livelier tone already evident in his
voice at the thought of his departure—“he is
the colour of a donkey. I think there must
have been a mesalliance in his family! I saw

him in the street one day being trotted out for
some one, and he turned his head and looked at
me as if he said I wish you would buy me; so I
got the vet. to find out who he belonged to, and
outbid the fellow he did not like, and now we
are great friends. I must ride him around to
Tite Street some day to show him to you; but”
—with impatience—"you will not be there!"
“ No."
“When are you coming back?” with friend-
ly urgency.
She shakes her head doubtfully.
“I have not very much to come back to. I
shall not find a Rayon d'Or and six dead Jews,
and an equestrian general, waiting for me on
my hearthrug."
“But if you like, you may find the guilty au-
thor of them all there," replies he, laughing.
Then more seriously—“Without any joke, I
wish you would come home soon. You may
think I do not mean it—that it is only •blague';
but I assure you the knowledge that there is a
tribunal in a little house in Tite Street, before
which I must appear, has more than once made
me refuse work, which otherwise I should prob-
ably for the sake of filthy lucre"-with a shrug
-"have accepted."

“I wonder is that true?" she asks, doubt-
fully; her eyes averted from him, and resting
on the stone wall, which-hideous but philan-
thropic, built to employ workmen in a famine
year-girdles for seven miles the park of the
owner of the Llanberis Quarries,
“Why is it that I never can get you to real-
ise what a boon a genuine friendship with a wom-
an is to a man?" Her ear detects very readily
the slight accent on the adjective. “The
relations between men and women are so apt to
be spoiled by the introduction of a-a spuri-
ous element that I do not know "-with gentle
reproach-—"why one should be suspected of
lying when one rejoices at having secured the
real thing."
It is dull of her not to have any answer
ready; not even a sign of acquiescence.
“Was not it"-he goes on, and there is a
slight indication of discomfort in his voice at
her silence—“Balzac who said: “Ce qui rend les
amitiés indissolubles, et double leur charme est
un sentiment qui manque à l'amour, la certi-
tude.' I wish”-kindly—“I could put a little
of that certitude into you; you would then be an
ideal friend!”
The coach ahead of them has stopped, the

little mining village, which is the point de départ
of their climb, being reached. An hour later
they are being wound up the side of a cliff, on
an incline of a gradient not much less steep
than the side of a house, in little trucks; each
with a backless board thrown across it as sole
seat.
“ It is so delightful!" Sue has explained, as
they set off. “You feel as if you must fall back-
wards. Mother shut her eyes and screamed
the whole way. I wonder will you?”
But Mrs. Bligh does not. Her head is a
strong one, and to her the bird-like feeling of
triumphantly mounting brings with it nothing
but elation, as she looks down on the slate
rocks; on the profound Llanberis lake, which is
yearly being diminished by the heaps of refuse
slate weekly and monthly advancing their feet
further and further into its waters; on the men
like little flies walking about below. And then
they are slung up into the heart of the quarries
themselves, and find what a grand meaning
there lies in that word—which to most of us
calls up only memories of the tearful essays in
arithmetic of our childhood—the homely word
slate. Here they stand surrounded by sheer
walls of it; purple and lilac, and green and

olive; not a scrap of vegetation anywhere;
sheer walls and peaks and precipices of the
sombre, yet many-coloured splendour. One
above another rise the galleries where the quar-
rymen are working, some of the dark tunnel-
mouths now high up in air showing to what
a depth the cliff has been blasted and pickaxed
away since those tunnels were bored. There is
something of awful in the thought of the way in
which man—in some aspects so puny and
ephemeral an insect—is changing the face of
what we were wont to call the everlasting hills !
Everlasting, indeed! Whither has disap-
peared the mountain block which once filled the
huge gap now yawning between yon two parted
promontories? Within the last few months it
has been blown bodily away; the great rock
dissolved, as it were, into thin air. Soon, prob-
ably, the yet enduring crags will have melted
away with all the noble tints and shades on their
riven sides, before the might and the malice of
their tiny, evanescent, yet all-powerful foe.
Anne has sat down to rest on a green grey
ledge in a part of the quarry which has assumed
the air of a gigantic amphitheatre; range

range of semicircular seats, on which Titans, or
yet huger than Titans, might sit to look on at

some giant fight or game or race, in the arena
below. On the lake's further side, cloud-capped
Snowdon and his vassal hills seem looking on
with fear and dread at the havoc wrought on
their brethren opposite.
Mrs. Bligh is for the moment alone, the party
having drifted in different directions. Sue has
carried off some of them to a shed where men
are at work splitting the slates, which requires
nicety, and cutting them into shape; while
Pamela, clinging to George's hand to preserve
her balance with a tenacity which nothing but
the instinct of self-preservation could give, is
craning over a sheer rock-edge to watch a slate-
loaded iron basket worked by a crane slowly
mount the scarped hillside.
“What a strange idea of pleasure!”
The widow starts. She had not imagined
the sculptor to be near her; nor that his eyes,
like her own, were watching Miss Capell Smith's
rather perilous gymnastics. They have not ex-
changed words since their tête-à-tête drive, which
has left a vague impression of dissatisfaction on
both their minds. “It will be very perverse of
her"-laughing—"if she insists on breaking her
neck before I have succeeded in getting her to
sit for me."

“ Is she going to sit for you?" rather quickıy.
• That is more than I can say; I cannot get
a rational answer out of her. I can't induce her
to believe that I mean it seriously.”
“How?"
“I can't get either 'yes' or 'no' out of her;
and when I thought I had driven her into a cor-
ner, she escaped me by murmuring something
about her parents. I wish nobody had parents !
I wish every woman was born a widow.
Do
you suppose it is true, and that her parents
would object?”
“Since you wish to represent her as a Ne-
reid”-drily-" I think it is not unlikely."
"I do not see "-warmly what harm it
could do either them or her to lend me her
pretty little head; and whether I call her Ligea
or Cassiopeia or Saint Cecilia, is surely my af-
fair-not theirs."
“ Didn't I”_still drily -
-"understand you
to say that you wished to have her dear little
hands, too, to twist in your seahorse's mane?"
“Well, it would not do her much harm to
lend me them too, but as it happens, I do not
want them, I have been looking at them, and
there is not much character in them-there sel-
dom is in young girls' hands."

They are both silent for a minute or two,
watching the subject of their conversation, who
has by this time recovered her equilibrium, and
repudiated the support (which even from here
they can see to be offered with such nervous
eagerness) of young Mulholland. Anne is the
first to speak, but her utterance, when it comes,
sounds rather enigmatical; and is not eluci-
dated by her eyes, which are fastened on the
dark figure.
“I should have thought that your simplest
plan would have been to secure a permanent
sitter."
A permanent sitter? How do you mean?"
“One who could never expose you to the
mortification of a refusal ; whose duty it would
be to pose whenever and for whatever you
choose."
“Do you mean a professional model ? But,
of course! I have half a dozen.”
“I do not mean a professional model.” She
pauses, and then goes on in a constrained voice,
and with averted eyes—“To most professional
men a wiſe is a costly luxury; to an artist she
is a prime economy and a first-class invest-
inent."
“A wife!" he repeats, in a tone of surprised

consternation-which, had she been open at the
moment to impressions of the ludicrous, must
have made her laugh. “Is that what your mys-
terious inuendoes have been driving at? Et tu,
Brute! Well, I did not expect it of you. 1
thought that you, at least, were above the vul-
gar error of believing every man must have an
omnivorous wish to marry every woman he
looks or does not look at.” Coke speaks with a
not unnatural irritation, and with the speed of
one anxious to close an unwelcome theme.
Vulgar I may be, and no doubt am !” re-
torts she, highly nettled, and wilfully misunder-
standing ; “but I still think that when a man is
perpetually devouring a girl with his eyes, it
is a not unnatural inference that he wishes to
appropriate her.”
No sooner is this extremely objectionable
sentence out of her mouth than she bitterly re-
grets its utterance, but like most repentances,
hers comes too late.
He looks silently at her with a half-incredu-
lous displeasure, and moves away to meet Sue,
who is coming flying towards them.
“We are to go back in the workmen's train,"
cries she, breathless with excitement; "and Sir
Thomas has asked Mr. -"—the agent, and a

personal friend of the Lascelles'-" to let as
many of us as there is room for travel on the
engine. Oh! I hope there will be room for
me !"
“You shall go instead of me—I will give
you up my place,” replies the sculptor good-
naturedly, in a voice which bears no trace of
the late ruffling of his temper; and taking Sue
by the hand he walks off with her to make the
proposed sacrifice.
The workmen's train carries the quarrymen
back to Port Dinorwig, after work-hours; and
on its engine, worked by Mr. — himself, Mrs.
Bligh and the enraptured Sue make their de-
scent. In the interest of observing the one
thousand two hundred quarrymen sitting to-
gether close as sardines on the loaded slate
trucks; and in the excitement of watching how
many of the two thousand four hundred pend-
ant fustian legs are grazed by the perilously
close rock wall as the train bends round an
abrupt curve, the little girl is so absorbed that
the grown woman may enjoy her own reflec-
tions undisturbed. At Port Dinorwig Coke is
to quit the party, in order to pursue his journey
to London.
Must they part thus ? At first it seems that

it will be so. It appears obvious to her that
in the last rapidly fleeting moments, while the
horses are being put to, he pointedly avoids
her. She cannot let him go without any apol-
ogy or peacemaking overture. He is already
drawing on his gloves, and said his last graceful
civilities to Lady Lascelles, when, in desperation,
she walks without any subterfuge straight up
to him.
" It was a temptation of the devil,” she says,
in a low key ; “are you very, very angry with
me?"
Her voice shakes perceptibly, and there is
an evident sincerity in her eyes.
He looks back at her, softened, but still
jarred.
“I am never angry with you,” he answers,
taking her hand in farewell ; “but when you
say those sort of things, dear friend, you rub a
little of the bloom off our friendship.”

CHAPTER X.
“I AM the last person in the world to deny
what a boon to us the Lascel'es are," says Mrs.
Mulholland, the next morning at breakfast.
"You might as well deny that two and two
make four, as that they head our rather scanty
list of blessings," interrupts her husband peev-
ishly.
“I do not deny it; but ”—with good-hu-
moured pertinacity—“what I do maintain is
that they are unsettling ; one can't fix one's
mind to anything, when one never knows at
what hour of the morning Lady Lascelles may
spring a serene highness, or an ambassador, or a
sculptor, through the garden door upon one."
“As many serene highnesses and ambassa-
dors as she pleases. I am not much afraid of
lacking subjects of conversation with them, and
introduced by whatever door it may please her
whimsical little ladyship; but as to her last
protegé, I tell her fairly I am inclined to pick a
quarrel with her!"

in his own line; and, indeed, he must be, if he
asks the prices Nan told us.
Now Nan, I ap-
peal to you "--rising from the table, since the
meal is ended, and putting her hand on her
schoolfellow's shoulder, as they pass into the
drawing-room-“shall not we be much more
cosy to-day, having ourselves to ourselves? I
do not feel as if I had had the least bit of good
of you yet! I do not grudge you to Czar, but I
do grudge you to perfect strangers! I have not
heard a single word about your life since we
parted, except, of course, just the main facts of
your marriage, and the-in fact”-doubtful-
ly—“I never feel quite sure whether you like
talking about it.”
“I had rather talk about yours.”
* Ah, you poor dear thing! it must seem
wonderfully bright to you; but”-reassuringly
-“ I have one little shoe-pinch too."
“ Have you? I am sorry to hear it.”
“Not a very uncommon one, only L. S. D.
I could do with a little more money ; not for
myself, of course !-when one has the main
thing of life, one does not much mind about the
extras- but for Czar."

“ You look so well off.”
“ You mean that we have carriages and
horses, and plenty of servants. Ah! that is his
royal sort of way! Once I proposed to him to
reduce the establishment, send away one of the
footmen and a housemaid or two, and have fewer
in the kitchen ; and he made no objection, not a
word; but he went about looking so drooping,
so utterly wretched, that of course I never had
the heart to repeat the suggestion.”
“ No ?”
Then, naturally, he would like to do more
for George. He-George-has never been to
either University, because his father could not
afford to send him ; literally, could not afford ;
that is, unless he gave up his own rooms in St.
James's Place, and his little summer trips to
Dieppe, and in fact everything that makes life
life to him! He told the boy so himself, with
tears in his eyes; that is why his children adore
him so. He treats them like friends and equals.
George was so touched!”
“ Was he? Poor George !"
“ Then, Lucile: you see what a really re-
markable turn she has for animal drawing ! He
longs to give her a chance. Indeed, one day I
found her crying, because he had just told her

that he meant to put down his Whitechapel, in
order to be able to give her some really good
lessons. Of course, none of us would hear of
such a sacrifice; but those are the generous kind
of impulses that he has !”
An hour later, Mrs. Bligh and Pamela are
walking through the crisp March morning to-
wards the noble old feudal castle of Beaumaris,
which stands, with the little town that has
grown up at its feet, close beside the Straits,
across which the Snowdon Range has looked
down upon it for its five hundred years of stout
life and robust decay. It is girdled by a high
loopholed wall, bursting out at intervals into
round towers.
They go inside and pace the grassy circle-
once, perhaps, a moat-between the outer and
the inner walls; and enter through a broken
arch, the turfy square, where the donjon fronts
them; and where the still massive though ruin-
ous windows darken like eye-sockets in the
Keep's grey face. They sit down to rest on a
bench, and after a minute or two of silence Pa-
mela says:
" Why is it that as often as one is particularly
comfortable, one is sure to feel Fate giving one
a push from behind, and telling one to move on?”

MRS. BLIGH,
“Does one ? I do not see the present appli-
cation."
“No? But, of course not. Why should
you! It is only that I am feeling just that push
at the present moment; I should like "--with
girlish exaggeration—" to stay here with you
for ever, and I know that if I did right I should
go
back to London to-morrow."
Why?”—quickly—“ have you—?” She
stops, unable to put into words the senseless
fear that assails her as to the motive that may
dictate the girl's proposed return.
“ Have 1—what?" asks Pamela, looking up
puzzled by something in her companion's voice.
"No, I have not-anything ”-laughing—“but
I know that if I had any sense of honour-some-
times I think I have not I should be off from
here by that horrible jangling station 'bus to

signs that a crisis is approaching."

ed; and with an inward blush at the thought of
how entirely her absorption in her own concerns
have blinded her to everything outside them.
“What reason have you for thinking so ?”
“Have not you noticed "—again laughing,
but with vexation—“ with what touching itera-

tion poor dear Mrs. Mulholland keeps telling me
that I am one of the family?"
“Ye-es”—not quite truthfully, but ashamed
to acknowledge her own want of observation--
“ I think I have.”
“ And Czar has quite given up trying to kiss
me on the stairs !”
“ That at least is clear gain.”
“Even he ”—pursues Pamela with a swift
smile—“sees the impossibility of making love
to his own daughter-in-law.”.
“I should think so !”—emphatically.
“But I am not so much the gainer as you
suppose "-gloomily—“I do not find the stairs
any safer. I have only exchanged the father for
the son.”
“Does George pounce out upon you too?"
“Oh, no, poor fellow! there is no pouncing
about it. Only, he is always on the landing, or
at the foot of the staircase, looking reproachful,
and begging me to tell him what he has done,
and why I am so changed. Of course, I can't
explain to him that growth is not change.”
Anne is silent. Her companion's assertion,
made once before, as to having outgrown her
old lover in intellectual stature, always gives her
a sense of discomfort and guilt. Her eye rests

absently on the tercentenary ivy which hangs
on the wall, still and unreached by the March
wind that is loudly singing and shouting to the
white horses in the Straits outside, like a chari-
oteer that is urging those foaming steeds to
higher speed.
“ He is so under-educated!”-continues the
girl irritably, boxing a daisy's ears with her
umbrella point—“so limited ; his horizon is no
further from his nose than that!” indicating a
space not wider than an inch from her own dis-
dainful feature.
“ Poor fellow! That is more his misfortune
than his fault."
· Yes; I know he has only to thank that
abominable old Czar, who sent him to a cheap
and nasty school, for fear of having to buy less
expensive wigs and teeth, and have fewer of the
‘parties fines' he is always talking of at Big-
non's, if he put him to a decent one; but the
fact remains all the same"— with a resolute
shake of the head—“he is as narrow as that !"
indicating another minute space with her finger
and thumb. “ If you begin to talk to him about
anything — art, literature — you are pulled up
at once by a blank wall of ignorance on his
part.”

165
Mrs. Bligh is again silent. Her own small
experience of the young man has tallied too
completely with the opinion now expressed by
her companion, for her to be able honestly to
controvert it; and yet she feels a vague sense
of regret at having been the means of opening
the scornful young eyes beside her to their old
playfellow's shortcomings. They sit for a while
in mute quiet on their sunny bench; and some
Militia who, when they arrived had been drill-
ing in the green close, making a scarlet splash
against the sobriety of the low-toned masonry,
depart, and leave the place to their undisputed
possession.
" And yet there is something to be said for
him too!” continues Pamela presently, the pen-
dulum of her judgment beginning to swing
towards the other direction as it becomes evi-
dent that no remonstrance against her unflatter-
ing estimate of her admirer is forthcoming ;
“ he has a good deal of natural shrewdness; he
manages all the business of the Tandem and
Life Boat Clubs. I have known him all my life,
so that I should have nothing to find out; his
conduct to that old pig; his father, who has
blasted his life, is simply angelic; and I do not
suppose if I lived to be a hundred, that I should

ever have such a solid block of devotion offered
to me again."
At the beginning of this speech, Anne has
felt inclined to laugh at the singularly slender
and unattractive list of attractions so dispas-
sionately put forth, but at the end she grows
grave.
“A solid block of devotion," judging
from the very few and small chips that have
ever fallen to her own share, a woman would
indeed be wise to think long and weigh nice-
ly ere she rejected — “whole block." And
yet-
“ If the fors and againsts of any course of
action were not so inextricably mixed, how
much simpler life would be !” cries the girl
impatiently.
“Well,” says Mrs. Bligh, caustically, yet not
unkindly, “ I suppose that since you approach
the subject in so business-like a spirit, all you
have to do is to take out your scales and see
which kick the beam, the pros or the cons ;
which weighs heaviest : his want of book-learn-
ing, or his management of the Tandem Club;
the narrowness of his horizon, or the depth of
his heart?"
Pamela's cheek grows a shade nearer in hue
to her fresh lips at the slight sarcasm of her

friend's tone, but after a minute she rejoins
impulsively-
“I will abide by your decision, then! It
was you who first opened my eyes to his defi-
ciencies. Heaven knows, poor fellow, they are
obvious enough—but I did not see them, or they
did not seem to matter, till you pointed them
out you shall make up my mind for me.”
“I!"_with an accent of the strongest and
most horrified negation—"Not for worlds!”
" They all wish it so much, poor dears!”—
says Pamela, in a voice of the utmost perplex-
ity, pushing up her hat and her curly hair, and
revealing a quarter of an inch more of charming
low square brow; not, as in the case of many
people who unadvisedly displace their fringe,

a matter of course I was ashamed to own that I
saw anything in him; but all the same I have a

yet at one time it did very well. I believe it
would have gone on doing very well if I had
not seen-become acquainted with—No, not so
much as that, but just got a glimpse of-some-
thing far different-something, oh, how much
better!"
Her eyes are bent on the ground, but more
in thoughtfulness than confusion, nor is there
any variation of colour or flutter of voice to jus-
tify the outrageous pang of fear that clutches
the elder woman by the throat at the inno-
cently-meant words. There is silence. The
lion wind of March has penetrated, but trans-
lated into a lamb, even this retired corner. How
gently he is running over the ivy branches,
wagging them as he goes. The girl looks
up suddenly with an excited resolution in her
blooming face.

“Since it is you who have showed me that
better—that different-yes, do you think I have
not seen the reflection of it in your face all these
days?—you shall decide for me. I have told
you as well as I can how I feel. I am not very
happy at home, as you know ; I rather wish to
marry; I know that he would be my humble
servant all his life; and I really do like him-in
a way! But is that enough? If you say yes, it
shall be yes; if you say no, it shall be no! Now,
which is it to be?"
She has turned her lovely countenance, be-
comingly animated yet not deeply moved, fully
towards her companion, and awaits her answer
with a serious smile. Anne averts her face.
Since it is apparently a dial plate on which her
emotions are written with such lamentable
plainness, her young friend shall not, at all
events, have the opportunity of reading the
strong temptation now legibly written upon it:
the temptation to accept the power over anoth-
er's destiny thus thrust into her hand, to give
the advice which to many unprejudiced persons
would seem the best possible under the circum-
stances; would pronounce that Yes, which, in
addition to wafting this exquisite little bark into
a safe and weather-tight harbour for life would

also-even to her own soul she scarcely formu-
lates that “also.” If George Mulholland take
Pamela Capell Smith to wife, there is not the
slightest doubt that she will never pose either
as a Nereid or as any other 'id or 'ad to Sir
Robert Coke. She remains so long silent, and
with averted head, that Pamela loses patience.
“I do not believe that you are paying the
smallest heed to what I am saying "—she cries
reproachfully—“Oh, do please answer, one way
or the other."
Then, since it can no longer be avoided,
Mrs. Bligh turns her face—to the girl's sur-
prise a deeply troubled one—upon her ques-
tioner.
“How can you ask such a thing ?”-she says
sternly—“How dare you try to thrust upon me
such a responsibility ?”
Pamela droops the corners of her mouth like
a scolded child.
“ You refuse, then?"
· Undoubtedly I do!”—with a stringent and
indignant emphasis.
Absolutely ?”
“ More than absolutely, if there can be
more!"
The other sighs impatiently, and for a min-

ute or two looks extremely downcast. Then
her countenance clears.
“I will decide it by drawing lots !”-she
cries triumphantly—“ that is as good a way as
any other; and at least you will not object to
holding them ?”
As she speaks, she stoops and picks two of
the grass blades—fine and dainty as is ever the
herbage in these unploughed feudal closes—and
measuring them carefully together, pinches off
half the stalk of one to make it conspicuously
shorter than the other; and having done so, un-
clasps the reluctant fingers of one of her friend's
hands and forces the two blades between them.
“There !” — turning away her head, and
screwing up her eyes—“I will not look till you
have arranged them. You understand, the long
one is George, the short one"/her voice invol-
untarily taking on a tone of greater alacrity,
“is no George. Are you ready?”
Mechanically Anne obeys, and holds out her
clenched hand, in which the two fateful grasses
are sitting with their green heads exactly and
deceptively on a level. In a second Pamela has
whipped out—the long one.
“Then it is to be George!" she says, in a
rather flat voice, which, if it expresses no dis-

may, certainly evidences no elation. The ela-
tion, if it exists, is elsewhere. Anne's heart has
given an ungovernable spring of relief and sat-
isfaction in the answer thus rendered by blind
fortune to the appeal addressed to her.
But that throb of keen and unalloyed pleas-
ure has but a moment's life. At the sight of
the delicate and brilliant creature beside her,
thus indifferently tossing herself and her possi-
bilities away to so unequal a destiny, a wave of
perhaps unnecessary remorse—since, after all,
she has been only passively instrumental in the
decision-sweeps over Mrs. Bligh. With an
impulse of possibly quixotic generosity, and a
gesture of revolt all the more decided because
it is the result of a victory over her own inter-
ests, she snatches the grass blade, which the
other is still thoughtfully eying, out of her
hand, and tosses it to the spring breeze.
It is not George!” she says, in a low and
troubled, but emphatic voice. “It shall not, and
can't be George! I refused just now to inter-
fere; I know that: but”—with ever-rising agi-
tation—“it is impossible—I should be committing
a crime if I let you. You do not care a straw
about him. Would you have taken such a way
of deciding, if you had ? He is not the least

worthy of you.” Her excitement increasing as
the image of George, dull, sulky, and provincial,
rises before her mind's eye—“What a fool you
must be, not to see that you are meet for his
masters!'
The week, but young when the foregoing
conversation was held, has run out. It is sun-
day morning, and against the obscured window-
panes the rain is smartly dashing. At a table in
the school-room window Mrs. Mulholland, with
Concordance and Bible open before her, is help-
ing Sue to prepare that portion of scripture, her
exegesis of which is shortly-weather permit-
ting—to be imparted to a class of small Welsh
scholars at the Sunday school. The little girl
is listening, amiable but bored, and with an anx-
ious eye covertly cast on the weather.
“Oh, mother!” cries she, presently, in a dis-
tressed voice, “I am so afraid it is going to
clear."
“Afraid !” repeats Mrs. Bligh, who is also
present, looking up with lifted eyebrows from
her book. “I am sure I hope it is. I do not at
all agree with you, Sue.”
“Ah! but you have not to teach in the Sun-
day school,” replies Sue, with a heavy sigh.

MRS. BLIGH.
Mrs. Bligh laughs. “No, I own that would
alter my views of the weather a good deal.”
“I was in great luck last year," rejoins the
child, encouraged by the unexpected sympathy
from a grown-up person.
“I had seven quite
wet Sundays. Oh, how I hope it is not going
to clear!”
But the ardour of this aspiration does not,
as some optimists would have us believe, pro-
cure its fulfilment. The rain veil draws away
from the earth just in time for the infant Cymri
to receive the benefit of whatever new lights
upon the subject of Joseph and his Brethren
can be struck out of the combined efforts of Sue,
her mother, and Fezy. The part taken by the
latter has indeed been confined to standing on
the sofa with one paw laid on the Concordance
and mumbling the fingers held out to wave him
off, with the little white pearls his teeth, but all
so gently and airily that it would need a heart
of stone, a heart at all events, a good deal harder
than Sue's to rebuff him.
By the afternoon, thanks to a drying wind,
it is fine enough for Mrs. Bligh and her hostess
to stroll together along the high-running pri-
vate road, through their neighbor's park, the
right to frequent which is one of the most con-

tinual themes of Mrs. Mulholland's gratitude,
and her husband's brag. They have sat down
on a now sunny bench which for back has the
quarried rock, over whose crest great gorse
bushes, all aflower, are hanging out their ori-
flammes. From their point of vantage on what
a fair prospect their eyes may feed; turning
from where, on the extreme left, a long straight
line of foam stretching from the mainland to
little Puffin Island, shows where the Dutchman's
Bank—that fatal sandbank on which more than
one vessel has found her death—lies right across
the sea, to where, on the right, intervening trees
hide out the graceful Menai Suspension Bridge.
Between, lie, and stand and curve, the range of
moderately heighted, delicately varied Carnar-
vonshire mountains. Lying in the bosom of the
highest twain, one divines, without seeing it, a
little dark lake. Anne's eyes are full of the quiet
yet keen pleasure of the true sea and mountain
lover, but her companion's might be fixed upon
the Cromwell Road, and the Natural History
Museum, for all the enjoyment they express.
“I wish Czar had come with us," she says,
uneasily. “If you had pressed him a little more,
I think he would. It might have distracted his
thoughts."

“He does not care much about scenery,

“Oh, I do not know. About as much as

it, and misunderstood him when he only meant
to be kind. But even I had no notion of how
much his heart was set upon the marriage. In
some ways I think he is more to be pitied than
even George."
Anne raises her eyebrows. “I do not think
I can go quite so far as that.”
Young people get over anything ; but he,

course is not young really, and he has taken it
dreadfully to heart, You see, between ourselves

made it all plain sailing. He frets sadly at not
being able to do more for George.”
She pauses expectantly, and Mrs. Bligh is
aware that some slight sign of admiration for
such paternal tenderness is expected of her.
But the recollection of the dinners at Bignon,
and the Chat Noir, as reported by Pamela, are
too recent in her mind to make any such utter-
ance possible. She looks away uneasily, towards
the tallest hill, round whose head a scarf of va-
pour is twisted, and thence drops her eyes upon
the lower range, with their network of stone
walls, and their little dark-green woods sunk in
hollows.
“ It was a thunderbolt, nothing less to us
all," continues Mrs. Mulholland. “ We had al-
ways looked upon it as a certainty. I am sure
you must have heard me a hundred times tell
her that she was one of the family.”
“Yes, I have often heard you say so."
"I really thought she was; we all took it
for granted. It shows ”–disconsolately—“that
we ought never to take anything for granted.
But ever since she arrived this time, I have
seen a difference, a coldness. One might really
imagine that she must have heard something
against George, against his character. And

I am sure there is no young man whose life
could better bear being looked into. Czar often
laughs at him for being so old - maidish, but
then,"—in a tone from which the element of
pride is by no means absent—“I imagine that
he had a jeunesse very orageuse."
The speaker's troubled eyes are fixed in all
innocence, and with no intention beyond a
vague desire for sympathy, upon her listener's.
But to the latter's guilty consciousness there
seems to be a questioning suspicion in them.
She can for the moment frame no rejoinder.
But her friend does not miss it. With her nose
down, like a questing hound, she is follow-
ing the trail of the idea started by herself.
“Do you think it is possible that anyone
could have set her against him? But no! what
motive could anyone have for being so mali-
cious ? You are the only person she is likely
to have discussed him with, and ”—with a smile
at the ludicrous improbability of the suggestion
-“I scarcely suspect you of having done us
such an ill turn. You"-affectionately--"would
have given us a helping hand, if you could, that
I am sure of.”

cerity in which they are uttered, effectually as

had just been labouring, do not make her feel
more comfortable. She avoids her companion's
confident glance, and looks straight before her
across the Strait, to the sweet narrow valley
of Aber, and the bluff headland of Penmaen-
Mawr.
“ In such cases no one has
any
business
either to help or hinder,” she says, trenchantly.

CHAPTER XI.
Long before a se'nnight has passed since the
departure of Pamela—who had wisely fled im-
mediately upon the springing of her mine-Mrs.
Bligh's action has changed its aspect in her own
eyes, from one of heroism to that of treachery.
She would have dearly liked to have accom-
panied her young friend in her exodus, but she
stays behind as a sort of expiation. To a nature
frank to a fault and open to a misfortune, the
daily and hourly dissimulation entailed by the
guileless confidence of the Mulholland family in
her sympathy, and by the certainty that they
express a hundred times a day of her wish to
help them if she could to the desired goal, is a
punishment and a trial almost beyond her pow.
ers. Scores of times she has all but yielded to
the temptation of bringing down a new thun-
derbolt; of springing a second mine, by crying
out, “ You have to thank me for it! It was I
that did it!” Scores of times she has begun a
sentence, the end of which must send her to

pack up her box in hopeless estrangement from
the little group now hanging so affectionately
around her. And scores of times the sentence
has dwindled away unfinished the match has
gone out, the determination has died; killed
partly by the difficulty and pain of forcing any
suspicion into minds so absolutely and obtusely
unsuspecting; and secondly by the entire hope-
lessness of conveying to any intelligence a com-
prehension of the grotesque and distorted gen-
erosity which had dictated her action.
That she had counselled Pamela to reject
George because she herself was particularly
anxious that she should marry him ; though the
exact and naked truth, is so far more incredible
than any lies, that it would be impossible to
gain credence for the statement without further
explanation, the mere distant self-suggestion of
which makes her writhe. And so, through the
lengthening spring days in strolls among the
quickening trees, and by the breeze-swept sea;
in tedious threshings-out of the subject over
needlework by day, and endless lamentations
over bedroom fires at night-she works out her
atonement.
Mrs. Mulholland's topics of conversation
have never been very numerous, as, indeed,

la's mysterious crime has swallowed up all its
scanty brethren. It is discussed, in all its bear-
ings, from morning to night; but the favourite
mode of treatment, and the one which tries
most severely the auditor's nerves, consists of a
never-ending series of speculations upon the
whose and the why of that malevolent influence
which had wrought the baneful metamorphosis.
It is not only from the friend of her schooldays,
but from the whole of the family, with the ex-
ception of the main sufferer, that she has to
bear the brunt of the maledictions launched
with such heartiness and unanimity against the
unknown author of the family misfortune; male-
dictions in which she is called upon so often to
join that Richard III.'s line is perpetually rising
in her mind :-
“Had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.”
Twenty times a day she is obliged to curse her-
self. Once, driven to desperation, she has pro-
posed an abridgment of her visit, a return
home; but has been met by such piteous up-

braidings and entreaties that no course has been
open to her but to at once withdraw the sug-
gestion.
“ I do not know what would become of Czar
if
you, too, left us. You are sure he does not
care about you? Oh, come”-with a light
accent of reproach—“that is putting the saddle
on the wrong horse ; he is so sensitive, he
says
he is sure you do not like him. I tell him it is
only your manner—that you always had rather
a short manner; but if you go-and the Las-
celles away too-he will have no motive for
keeping up at all. You do not know how he
droops and mopes when we are alone."
“Oh, don't I wish I could get hold of who-
ever it was that set her against us!” cries
Lucile, with honest energy, “would not I punch
his or her head? Dear pet !”—her eyes ten-
derly following her father's figure, seen through
the window, walking with more pensiveness and
less spring than usual along the garden path-
“ I declare it has made him look five
years
older.
But even now, is not he wonderful for his age?”
I do not think”—evasively—“that I quite
know how old he is."
“Oh, no more do we exactly; he would not
like us to."

“ He tore the leaf out of the Bible that had
his birthday on it," says Sue, in a rather lowered
voice, “so I expect he is pretty old. But is not
he wonderful ? His lovely hair, and his teeth
all his own; at least”—with some stirrings of a
compunctious veracity—“at least, a great many
of them."
“We must all do our best to cheer him up,”
says Mrs. Mulholland; her glance, like her step-
daughter's, pursuing the languid figure of the
head of the house ; “I was saying so to George.
He went out this morning early to try and get
him a widgeon for dinner; it is the only thing
he seems to fancy."
“I should have thought that it was poor
George himself who needed widgeons," says
Anne, drily. But this is not the view taken by
the family, nor, indeed, by the sufferer himself.
With an angry and compunctious amazement,
Mrs. Bligh sees how entirely the young man-
severely as his own dejected countenance and
forced spirits show him to be suffering-enters
into his relatives' views as to Czar's being the
prime claims for sympathy and consolation. It
gives a daily, sharper edge to the widow's re-
morse for her ill-judged interference to discover
of what matter-of-fact self-effacement, of what

obscure heroism he is capable, whose future she
has thought herself justified in destroying, be-
cause he has a Welsh accent; because he once
confused the poet Browning with a local iron-
monger of the same name; and because he had
resented with a not unnatural display of spirit
her own early incivility towards him. The
result of her compunctious reflections translates
itself directly into speech-speech addressed to
her victim's sister.
“How wonderfully well he bears it! How
plucky he is over it !”
“ Yes, is not he?"-warmly. “It is so un-
usual to have such spirits at his age.”
“At his age? Why, he cannot be more than
four-and-twenty.”
"Czar not more than four-and-twenty !" with
a burst of astonished laughter.
“Czar! Who was talking of Czar? I spoke
of George."
“Oh, George, poor fellow! Yes"-with less
enthusiasm—“it is good of him. He tries to
keep up for Czar's sake.”
“You certainly are the most devoted son and
daughter that ever man was blessed with!” says
Anne, in a tone, the profound astonishment ex-
pressed in which she is herself not quite aware of.

“ It would be very odd if we were not,” re-
turns Lucile, with emotion; “never in all our

thing disagreeable to us it hurts him a great
deal more than it hurts us. When he told
George last autumn that he could not let him
go with the Lascelles to Scotland because it was
impossible for him to afford him any money to
tip the keepers, the tears literally rolled down
his cheeks; George told me so himself.”
Anne sinks into a marvelling silence, ponder-
ing upon the strangeness of human nature;
upon
how little solid virtues or benefits avail to
gain its oddly-built affections, and upon the in-
comprehensibility of the cult produced in these
honest and simple hearts by an egotist, who can
win their eager consent to his gnawing of their
patrimony, and suppression of their rightful
pleasures, by a few blathering phrases and
crocodile tears. Her remorse towards the fami-
ly takes several different shapes. The first is a
warmly-urged invitation-addressed both to the
girl herself and to her mother—to Lucile, to
pay her a long visit in Tite Street, with a view

to getting those helps towards the cultivation of
her talent which her father has tearfully ex-
plained himself unable to give her.
“My little house and I are so useless,” Anne
has said rather ruefully; “I should be so glad
if I could feel that either of us were doing any
good to our fellow-creatures."
And when the girl has responded with spark-
ling eyes and phrases of exaggerated, yet evi-
dently genuine gratitude, Mrs. Bligh's con-
science—such is our leniency to ourselves—al-
ready feels itself a little eased of its burden.
Another and much more irksome form of her ex-
piation is the joining with his family in their at-
tempts to raise Czar's spirits, the best means of
attaining which would apparently lie in induc-
ing him-no hard task-to talk about his past
life, and about the wholesale ravages among the
female sex which, according to his own implica-
tion, have characterised it. When she has list-
ened with complacency for the third time to
that anecdote which relates how, being in a
four-wheeled cab with a matron-over his re-
lations to whom he chuckles a good deal—he
recognised in the driver the fair one's infuriated
husband, and yet had the presence of mind to

consciousness—when, I say, she has listened
with a smile of approbation for the third time
to this choice study in ethics, she feels as if her
debt were, indeed, all but wiped off. With
George himself it is true her efforts are not
crowned with that success which marks her in-
tercourse with his kin. Though it is apparent
from their manner to her, and their reiterated
assurances of confidence in her good will, that
he has not imparted his suspicions to them, yet
she feels that if he does not absolutely know-
as how could he?-yet that he divines whose
has been the adverse influence which has laid
low his hopes. She has made several shy efforts
—very difficult to a reserved and self-conscious
woman-to approach him in a propitiatory
spirit, but has been invariably met by a rebuff ;
a rebuff that in her normal state would have
driven her to a stinging retort, but compunction
has made her humble, and sends her back to re-
peat her spurned endeavour. One evening, see-
ing him sitting with both hands clutching his
forehead, as he bends over an odd volume of
Browning, accidentally left behind by Pamela-

over his shoulder at the open page of the Ring
and the Book,' a poem no doubt selected by him
for the misleading simplicity of its title, she
says:
“ You have chosen rather a hard nut to

He starts, not having been aware of her
neighbourhood.
"Thank you,” he says, brusquely. “It would
be a waste of time; he is a cut above me! I
had better stick to what I understand," osten-
tatiously tossing away the book, and picking up
the Pink 'Un.

rudeness is hard to bear, his kindness is far
She is moved to tears of compunction,
when on the day before her departure—they let
her go at last—he awkwardly presents her with
a basket of plovers' eggs, gathered expressly for
her, with a mumbled intonation that she had
said she was fond of them. It is very stupid of
her, but the guilty tears literally spring to her
eyes.
“For me? You got them on purpose for

The acknowledgment sounds to an unin-
structed ear so ludicrously out of proportion to
the benefit bestowed, that Mrs. Mulholland
breaks into a laugh.
Why, Nan, you could not be more obliged
to him if he had saved your life!”
“ He likes doing things for other people !”
adds Lucile, with a loving look at her brother,
“and besides”—pressing Anne's hand meaning-
ly—“ he knows that you would get us rocs' eggs
if you could; do not you, George?”
It is the day before her departure, as I have
said. The spring--so long has she been their
guest—is, unlike Christabel's, coming "quickly”
up this way. It seems a sin to leave these bur-
geoning woods before the blue of their hyacinth-
flooring has burst from its green cradle; and
yet, wood and hyacinth lover as Anne is, she
feels a feverish hurry to be back in her narrow
town home, little as it would seem that she has
to return to. Between the two friends who
parted from her now nearly a month ago and
herself, a wall of separation appears to have
grown up. They afford her almost as little
knowledge of the world into which they have
flown back, as did Noah obtain from his heartless
raven. From Sir Robert Coke she has received

tionately worded; but containing the minimum
of information which even a man's letter can
supply. The first is beautified in her eyes by a
hope for her own speedy return. The second-
but then he described himself as in great haste
at the time of its penning-holds no such ex-
pression. She broods for days over the reason-
doubtless there is none, save the hurry he al-
leged—for its omission. Nor is Pamela-usually
to her friend an enthusiastic and exuberant
correspondent-much less chary of her letters.
She at least cannot have the excuse of crowded
hours, and pressing work, justly alleged by the
sculptor. Why is it then that her communica-
tions are so few, so short, and so dull? Only
one bears a trace of her old effusiveness, and in
that the expressions of enthusiasm usually ap-
plied to Mrs. Bligh are employed in describ-
ing a Sunday spent by Miss Capell Smith at
a country house ; which she seems to have
enjoyed with an extravagant zest, of the cause
for which she gives no adequate explanation.
Over this, too, Anne puzzles long and anx-
iously. It may be that the girl has a delicacy
in addressing letters to a house where the
sight of her handwriting—formerly so frequent

and so familiar-must need arouse painful feel-
ings.
Well, speculation on the subject is useless,
since as Anne reflects with a sigh of relief all
will soon be explained. She smiles to herself at
the agony-column phrase in which her thought
has dressed itself. In four-and-twenty hours she
will be back in Tite Street, and unless Pamela is
more changed than she can possibly believe, she

time you come; of course "_with a shade of
embarrassment and a memory of Czar's croco-
dile tears—"you shall be put to no expense.”
But to her surprise, her proposal, formerly
met by so effusive a welcome, now calls forth
only a confused and rueful evasion from the girl,
which is explained later by her stepmother.
“You see, Czar would not hear of it! he is
very, very much obliged to you; he says that if
he could bear to lie under an obligation to any
one, it would be to you; but even to you—I as-
sure you, you are a great favourite, though you
will not believe it—he cannot! It is his won-
derfully proud, lofty sort of nature. He
says
it
would break his heart to think that his children
were being pauperised !”
It is, therefore, with a debt quite unliqui-
dated, and a conscience a good deal more heavi-
ly loaded than the omnibus which carries her
and her moderate possessions, that Anne de-
parts. George drives her to the station, as he
had driven her from it on her arrival, almost
five weeks ago; he escorts her, despite her prot-
estations, to the platform; nor does he leave
her till her train is well in motion. He does it
all with an iron air of duty, which does not add
to her ease in receiving his civilities. It is not

till she is really seated in her carriage, and he is
standing conscientiously beside the door till the
parting whistle releases him, that she finds cour-
age to say:
“ If ever you want to run up for a night or
two, you will not forget Tite Street ? It is not
so very out of the way, whatever Czar may
say!”
There is to her own ears something self-be-
trayingly compunctious in her tone, and per-
hap she notices it. He only answers,
“ Thank you, but I am not likely to be in
London," and then-the guard waving his flag
—the young man takes off his hat with an hon.
estly struggled with air of relief, and in a minute
more she has lost sight of him.
Up to the last moment she had cherished
vague intentions of confessing herself to him ; of
offering to try to undo the ill she has done him.
But now it is too late. Her country outing is
over, and she may look back upon it, and upon
the mode she has chosen of manifesting her
gratitude for the simple and hearty hospitality
offered her, with what satisfaction she may.
Remorse holds undisputed sway over her mind

a little aside, and has successfully shoved it

off the scene by the time, towards seven o'clock
in the evening, that she and her dusty belong-
ings drive up to her own little green door.
Pamela is not on the doorstep; that is not
very surprising, since the exact moment of the
traveller's arrival can't be known; and a Lon-
don doorstep is not a place suitable for making
a prolonged stay on. But neither, when the
thrilling of the electric bell has brought a sémil-
lante parlourmaid in an embroidered apron to
the door, does there appear any sign of a visitor
within. For these can hardly be called visitors,
these two fawn-coloured and one iron-grey per-
son, who are saying, “How do you do?” in so
very loud a voice from the stairfoot. Their
barks are soon turned into squeaks of pleasur-
able recognition; that is, Sall's and Tory's are.
As for poor Twankle, his memory is as small as
his tiny body, and he has to own that he cannot
quite put a name to her.
She explains herself hurriedly to him, and
pushing them all gently aside, makes her way to
the hall-table, and casts an eager glance over the
notes and letters—not very numerous—which
await her there. Her first impression is one of
disappointment. In Coke's handwriting there
is nothing, and though there is a letter with Pa-

ing that its outside had inspired. Miss Capell
Smith has gone out of town for the inside of a
week, and though her letter is full of expres-
sions of regret at not being at home to welcome
back her friend, yet to that friend's mind the
words convey no adequate explanation of the
“why” of a departure, which so coldly coincides
with her own arrival. She is too chilled in
spirit to care for the moment to open the two
or three other missives addressed to her; but
gathering them carelessly up, mounts the stairs
with her still agitated escort of wagging tails,
and smirking muzzles, and enters her drawing-
room.
Its look of rigidly neat fireless emptiness
damps her still more than she already is. Ac-
customed to the lavish crowd of country blos-
soms in the Mulholland drawing-room, it looks
nudely flowerless. Her palms — she fingers
them discontentedly-have not been sponged
since her departure, have been overwatered, and

her feet on his last visit, and sinks down upon
it. On that evening she had expected him as
little as she does now ; possibly then-

ding from Lady St. George, the giver of the
luncheon at which she had begun her course of
ill-usage of young Mulholland, to dine with her,
on the invitation of a member of the Govern-
ment, at the House of Commons on the follow-
ing day. She throws the mine into the fire, and
promptly writes acceptance of the other two.
An eager desire has seized her to fill her
empty life with something, whether philanthro-
py, or social pleasures, is a matter of detail,
compared with the main object of filling the
useless vacuity of her existence. It had not
seemed either so void, or so profitless on her
journey, either at Chester, or even at Willesden,
or Euston, as it does to her to-night, sitting in
flat disappointment, with her feet on her brass
fender. Though of late she has been counting
the hours till her departure thence, she goes
nigh now to wishing herself back at Plas Drow;
to be again seeing and hearing Jim the terrier
gallop down the long drawing-room with the
hearth-brush, which it is in his nightly privilege
to have thrown for him to pursue and worry,
and then retire with it into his basket, to bite
yet a few more bristles off. She thinks almost
affectionately even of Czar. “I have fallen so
low that I should be quite glad to hear once

more the tale of the four-wheeler and the in-
furiated husband.” She says it out loud, and
laughs.
Morning brings a brighter mood, but neither
it, nor noon, nor afternoon bring any tidings of
the sculptor. A postman has just gone by,
empty-handed for her, when the arrival of Lady
St. George, and her brougham, to convey her
to the proposed entertainment, happily divert
her thoughts into a different channel.
Lady St. George asks her how she has en-
yed herself in the country, but is in too great
a hurry to tell her of her own next Sunday
luncheon, which is to include the Bishop of the
Andaman Islands, and the strong man from the
Aquarium, to listen to the answer. The theme
lasts till they reach their destination, and after a
walk and climb of about a mile and a half
through the immeasurable passages of the
House, find themselves in that black hole re-
served for the ladies. It is a new experience to
Anne, and she leans eagerly over the shoulders
of the fortunate occupiers of the front seats, to
peer through the grating at the ranks of legisla-
tors lounging so cavalierly below. Without
remembering her want of acquaintance with
her neighbours, she puts excited questions to

them, as to the identity of this or that one. A
prominent member of the Opposition, with a
mixed gift of waggery and Billingsgate, is up,
and is “slating" an occupant of the Treasury
Bench exactly opposite him, who, leaning com-
fortably back, is listening with a smile of placid
enjoyment to a statement larded with suitable
pleasantries, to the effect that his mendacity is
only equalled by his imbecility. When the
orator has sat down to the music of profuse
Hibernian cheers, Lady St. George and her
visitor descend, guided by their intending host,
to a small and inconvenient room, where they
are presently joined by two or three smart
women, three or four well-known men, and later,
to Anne's astonishment, by the two combatants
in the war of words she has just witnessed. As
they enter, the object of attack is patting his
assailant friendlily on the shoulder, and saying
in a congratulatory tone, “ You were in capital
form to-night.”

CHAPTER XII.
MRS. BLIGH has never before dined at the
House of Commons, that justly popular form of
social enjoyment, whose popularity sufficiently
disposes of any accusation brought against the
British upper classes of being the slaves of their
pampered palates, since they cheerfully exchange
their own chefs and vintages for a worse cooked
and served and waited-on dinner than falls to the
lot of many meaner persons. But then no ducal
mansion boasts such an after-dinner promenade
as the Terrace of the House of Commons.
There is about these dinners something of
the scrambling charm of a pic-nic, and also-
which no other pic-nic can afford—a gratifying
sense that you are helping to govern your
country, when, at the sound of the division bell,
the men of your party, with pushed back chairs
and thrown down dinner napkins, fly from their
tough mutton to the legislative arena. None of
the guests are known to Anne, except by repu.
tation, although by the time the feast is half

over, she has made out that one face which has
struck her as not quite unfamiliar, is that of the
diplomate of Lady St. George's Sunday luncheon
who had told one of the good stories of which
George Mulholland had amputated the point
for her; and who had appeared to be an inti-
mate of Sir Robert Coke's; perhaps from him
she may glean some information about her
strangely silent Lion. She has already—shel-
tered by the kindly gloom of the brougham-
hesitated a question to Lady St. George as to
whether she has lately seen him? Her answer
has been an absent and careless negative, fol-
lowed by a much more animated counter-query,
as to Mrs. Bligh's opinion upon the possibility of
capturing the sculptor for the Bishop and the
strong man next Sunday. The Diplomate is not
near Anne at dinner, but afterwards on the
Terrace her opportunity comes. She is stand-
ing alone gazing over the balustrade at the river
where, since no one is talking to her, and he
rather likes her look, he civilly addresses her.
“You have never done this kind of thing
before, I think I heard you say.”
“Never!” then changing the subject with
abrupt fear of letting her moment slip, she adds
hurriedly, “I think you had the pleasure-I

mean"-laughing confusedly—“I think I had
the pleasure of meeting you at luncheon at
Lady St. George's about six weeks ago."
He has not the faintest recollection of having
ever set eyes upon her before to-night, but he
has not led Cotilions in Vienna and Paris for
twenty years for nothing; so he replies with a
bow and a smile that he is not very likely to
have forgotten anything so agreeable.
“ We have an acquaintance in common!”
she says, still rushing at her fences—“ Sir
Robert Coke."
“Coke!”-in a tone of relief and pleasure-
“dear old chap! do you know him ? Let us
have a little talk about him! do you mind”-
turning up his coat collar and shivering—"walk-
ing up and down a bit. Thames breezes are not
exactly Zephyrs; and so you know dear old
Coke-charming artist, is not he ? one or two of
his things very nearly great, just something want-
ing. People say ill-natured things about him of
course, that he is played out, and Rococo, and
that the • Equestrian H. R. H.,' which got him
his Baronetcy has some startling anatomical
novelties, ha! ha!”
As she does not join in his mirth he arrests
it, and continues more gravely,

“That is envy, pure envy, of course, but
I wish he would stop their mouths with
something indubitable, insteed of the catch-
penny prettinesses he has been giving us of
late.”
Catchpenny prettinesses! The thought flashes
across the listener's mind whether the bust of
old Baron Issachar, taken from a cast after
death, is likely to come under the head of a
‘prettiness," whether catchpenny or otherwise ;
but the fancy is only a momentary one, and
gives way at once to the immense and painful
surprise caused by her companion's words. It
is the very first time that the idea has been pre-
sented to her that her friend's talent can be dis-
puted or his achievements held to be on the
wane. The combined novelty and unpleasant-
ness of the suggestion makes her incapable of
speech, incapable too of appreciating the noble
terrace she is pacing, the “huge and thoughtful
night” above her head, the towering Gothic
height of the House on her left hand or the
dark river full of lovely reflections on her right.
They have almost reached that end on which
the Speaker's house abuts, and on which-happy

that he is not going to get any rejoinder out of
her, resumes-
“ The fact is, he wants an inspiration, he is
too comfortable, he needs an emotion of some
kind to jog him out of his routine; if he could
get something or someone to stir him up, he
might do a big thing yet; people say no; that
it is too late, but I do not hold with them. I
believe in him, dear old chap! I told him so the
other day when I met him at
Mrs. Bligh starts. The name of the country
house mentioned is the same as that where Miss
Capell Smith had described herself passing that
Sunday, her prodigious enjoyment of which had
puzzled Anne.
“ When did you meet him at -?" she asks
hastily.
“Oh, two or three Sundays ago"-seeming
surprised at the eager look with which she ac-
companies her question—“I cannot recollect
the precise date."
“ Was it a pleasant party ?”
Again he looks surprised at a something
of unnecessarily serious and urgent in her
tone,
“ Was it -?"

imagine; Coke"-beginning to laugh—"seemed
to enjoy it."
A sort of foreboding of the cause of Coke's
enjoyment seems to close Anne's throat, but,
without further questioning, her interlocutor
proceeds to explain himself.
“Our hostess had got hold of a very lovely
young lady. I am bound to say we were all
rather on the qui vive about her, and Coke-you
know his partiality for your sex-was very much
at her feet."
“ Yes!"
“ It was all in the way of business, of course"
-his mirth rising again—" he was importuning
her to sit to him for a Venus or a nymph, or
something. I never saw him so much in earn-
est about anything in my life.”
“ Yes!”
“ But the fair one was obdurate; she looked
demure, and said she did not think her mamma
would like it. I am not sure that her mamina
was not right! Ah, there is Lady Olivia 24,"
as a fat and heavy-looking girl accompanied by
a couple of men comes within eyeshot. “They
call her Beef Olive. How do you do, Lady
Olivia ?"

mental equilibrium in an entirely new idea, and
perhaps it is due to the absolute novelty to her
of the suggestion of her friend's reputed deca-
dence in his art that it gives Mrs. Bligh such an
uneasy night.
“Played out," " Rococo," Catchpenny
Prettinesses.” The objectionable phrases buzz
in her ears and brain, as she tosses about in un-
happy wakefulness, or slips off into worrying
dreams. But the new idea, after all, has not the
whole stage to itself. It is pushing aside, and
again pushed aside, by one that is by no means
Very much at her feet.”
“ Never saw
him so much in earnest about anything in my
life,"
These phrases are but the expression of a
notion which has lain sometimes latent-some-
times more than latent-in Anne's own mind.
And then the two ideas, the new and the old
one, having tormented her separately, join in a
combined attack upon her—“What he needs is
an inspiration.” “If he could get hold of an
emotion of some kind, he might yet do some-
thing big !” And surely if he never was so
much in earnest in his life, as in the endeavour
to persuade Pamela to lend her shy loveliness to
his chisel, he must be within hail of that very

emotion, which, in the opinion of one long inti-
mate with him, may be his artistic salvation. Is
he conscious of this himself? If so, is it not the
bounden duty of any one who wishes him well,
of any one to whom his interest is nearer and
dearer than her own, to aid him to the utmost
of her power? If he is not conscious of what
would work so greatly to his advantage, is not
it the bounden though still harder duty of the
supposed well-wisher to point him out the path
which, set with roses, yet leads straight to the
desired goal of his own glory?
The disagreeable duties, that in the small
black hues of the night loom so great and un-
doubted are apt, when morning comes, to lose a
good deal of their size and stringency, and dur-
ing her dressing, breakfast, and forenoon a good
deal of uncertainty as to her own future action
sways Mrs. Bligh's disturbed heart and mind ;
but through the early afternoon the Puritan-
spirited formula, “ It must be right, because it
is so disagreeable,” goes on gaining in convinc-
ingness, until at four o'clock she puts herself
into a hansom for fear lest, if she trust herself to
walk, her resolution may break down, and gives
the address of Sir Robert Coke's studio. It is
the first time that she has intruded upon him

uninvited, and though he has frequently re-
proached her for not visiting him oftener, and
begged her in general terms to repair the omis-
sion in the future, yet the nearer she draws to
her destination-her Shrewsbury and Talbot
hansom conveys her undesirably fast—the more
general those terms seem to have been, and the
less to justify any special invasion. Probably
he has a model, or is engaged with some royalty
or millionaire, or worst of all, with some more
favoured female friend, on his tête-à-tête with
whom she is about to thrust her unasked and
undesired presence.
Coke's studio, or rather studios-for his ex-
tensive clientèle has long ago obliged him to
overflow the limits of his original atelier-stands
back from the street; and after dismissing her
cab, Mrs. Bligh has to cross a small slip of
smutty grass, ornamented with a coal-black town
tree, to reach it. In the brief transit her cour-
age falls so low that, but for the accident of
some one just happening to issue from the gen-
eral door of the block—an accidental some one
who would witness and marvel at her flight-
she would turn tail even now. Besides the lit-
tle forecourt, she has—when once inside-a long
corridor still to traverse, as the door at which he

has instructed her to ring—the door of the stu-
dio, where he himself models—away from the
din of his workmen's tools, and shut from the
inroads of the general public—is at the very
end of the passage. As she flits along that pas-
sage, her eye rests on the casts of some of his
principal works, which stand on either hand.
The · Lioness and Cubs, which first brought
him into notice; the · Dejanira and Centaur,'
which was his first commission from Royalty,
etc. Surely-the belittling phrase returning
upon her memory—there is no catchpenny pret-
tiness about them.
She has reached the door, whose closed as-
pect—although it is always closed-gives her a
fresh pang of misgiving, and rings the bell with
a shyness-born force which sets it jangling for
several moments—moments spent by her in the
too-late reflection of how much more consid-
erate and dignified it would have been on her
part to have rung the bell of the larger and
more public studio, and sent her card by the
head man to the sculptor. He would then have
had the option of escaping her visit, if it is ill-
timed. But she has now left him no more choice
in the matter than has a fox tracked to its
stopped earth.

The bell had just ceased its unnecessary
length of clamour, when the door opens slowly,
and as it seems to the trembling candidate for
admission, reluctantly, and the master of the
demesne' appears in the aperture. In the sec-
ond that elapses before he recognises her, she
has time to notice how ill he is looking; his
features drawn as with pain, and his whole look
giving a pulled-down impression. That impres-
sion disappears, or at least is greatly lessened
next instant, when his whole mobile face lights
up with a smile of friendly surprise and wel-
come; lights up with so bright a brightness as to
shine down the traces of sickness and suffering
which at first had been so legibly written upon it.
“My dear friend"-impulsively stretching
out both hands, and then laughingly drawing
them back-but then again holding them to-
wards her, though beyond touching distance, to
show her that clayey coating which forbids the
pressure that his kind and gladdened eyes tell
her he would like to give her fingers—“come
in, come in; this is too pleasant."
She gives a sigh of relief at so satisfactory a
solution of her doubts, but a trace of lingering
misgiving makes her still hesitate on the thresh-
old and ask dubiously-

“ Are you sure that it is quite convenient ?
That you have no model, no Rothschild, no
crowned head in there?”—peering beyond him
and laughing nervously.
“ You suspicious woman "_laying his hand
in momentary forgetfulness of its condition on
her shoulder, and gently urging her inwards;
come in and see for yourself.”
Then, indeed, yielding joyfully, she enters
and follows him as he walks, keeping a little be-
fore her. She gives a second sigh of pleasure
this time, when the inner door shuts her in
from the noise of the outer world, into this
pleasant-temperatured privacy ; where there are
no eyes more prying than the sightless ones of
the cast of the latest Venus—dug out of a
Roman garden—to comment upon her action,
which now seems fully justified by its success.
She looks round her with an air of leisurely en-
joyment upon the objects so familiar to her,
though she has only been here two or three
times before. The high carved wood mantel-
piece, above which a procession of Greek fil-
leted youths and maidens and priests is leading
a “heifer lowing at the skies" to a flower-
wreathed altar ; the charming little bronze
group of the Erl-king snatching the boy out of

his father's arms; the very lay figure; and the
unfinished clay bust swathed in wet cloths; all,
all are dear to her. From these her quick compla-
cent glance returns to their owner. But it loses
some of its satisfaction, when the strong light
pouring down from the top of the room shows
her afresh the traces of illness on her friend's
features, now that the transient, startled flush
has left them. From his worn face her
eye casu.
ally wanders downwards to his foot, whose limp-
ing she had already observed, and which she
now perceives to be made unshapely by a list
shoe.
“ “Now, madam!” he cries gaily, “are you
convinced that there is no little milliner behind
the screen?”
But she is too much occupied by the prob-
lem of that startling shoe to be able to answer

there is no use mincing matters; I have had
neither more nor less than a fit of the gout.”
“The gout !
There is consternation in her
tone, for, indeed, it would have seemed to her
almost as unlikely that the Vatican Apollo or
the Diskobolos should have their immortal limbs
swollen and tweaked by the old and ugly dis-
order indicated, as her spare and temperate
friend. He laughs at the exaggeration of her
tone.
“Yes, I have had my first memento not
mori, for I believe it does not kill one—but se-
nescere, which ”—with a shrug—“is worse. Do
you think "-affectionately—“that if I had not
been such a poor old cripple I should not have
been on the doorstep of the dear little house to
welcome you home; but ”—with a half-tender,
half-shamefaced intonation—" it is very coward-
ly of me; but I had hopes I might have hidden
my infirmities even from you yet a little longer."
She is still staring stupidly at that large, loose
shoe.
“ It is no use," she says presently, looking up
with a rather bewildered smile, “I have been
trying hard, but I cannot get you and crutches
to meet in my mind."

intonation.

from the man who bought my Marsyas—do you

“No, it had left the studio before I first vis-
ited you."
“ Well, a note from the fellow-he is a Shef-
field scissors-maker-saying that after mature
consideration he had come to the conclusion
that the stain in the marble on the back of the
statue is too bad for him to take it ; and if I can
sell it he will bear half the loss."
“ How very annoying !

“More annoying than you think, little friend.
He puts it upon the stain, but that is not his
real reason."

and more irefully hot at each clause of the enu-

tears, and her voice is choked. Her sympathy
is sweet to him, but yet he feels a certain em-

barrassment at the violence of her expression of
it; an embarrassment that prompts him to say
in a tone that aims at being light and gay-
“ But life is a system of balance and compen-
sation ; on the very day I heard of the Marsyas,
I got a so-and-so order for a reclining statue;
so that I was something like the thief who
summed up his day's work; 'lost —a clasp
knife; stole—a pocket-handkerchief'!”
His hearer is quite incapable of having her
thoughts conducted into the cheerfuller chan-
nels he thus tries to lead them into. Her eyes
are still flashing wetly, and her colour high.

me a week or two ago, by a boy I sent to study
in Paris, last year; is not it good ? did you ever
see the ewig muterliche more chaſmingly ex-
pressed ?"
“I do not see much in it,” she answers pet-
tishly, scarce deigning a look at the work of art
indicated, while in her ears there ring, in dis-
mal confirmation of the Reviewer's venomed
words, the phrases employed by her over-night
companion on the terrace of the House of
Commons.
Coke had expected her to receive his sug-
gestion of decadence with derisive laughter,
and vehement disclaimers, and little as she either
is, or pretends to be, of an art critic, her silence
dashes him. To shake off the sense of oppress-
ion derived from her lugubrious air, he cries in a
tone that only an ear to which the inflections of
his voice are very familiar, could detect to be
not really mirthful:

of indigestion while he was writing; perhaps
my guilty conscience misleads me, and my Shef-
field patron had never heard of him or his

of exasperation, half and only half feigned—“if

the end of this phrase that she recognises that
it is a parrot repetition of the diplomate's over-
night.
Why should not it be the fountain ?"
“I have thrown up the commission. The old
lady's views and mine differed too radically, so
I bowed her out.”
“ Then you no longer wish for Pamela Capell
Smith as a sitter?”
She speaks in a furtive voice, as one conscious
that she is laying a trap. Into it-such is the du-
plicity of man-her friend falls, at least to the
extent of maintaining a misleading silence. He
takes up a syringe and begins to squirt at the
wet-clothed bust without answering. She can-
not resist the temptation of letting him know
that she is better informed than he suspects.

“ At least,” she goes on, “it was not as a ne-
reid that you were trying to persuade her to
pose for you, when you met her at —?”
He gives a perceptible start, and drops his
squirt, turning round with a flushed face and a
guilty laugh.
“ You are a magician; there is no use trying
to hide anything from you; not that I did try!
I do want to persuade her to sit to me. I did
ask her, and got a 'no' like a box on the ear for
my pains. I daresay”—with a touch of bitter-
ness—“that one of these coming young Phid-
iases would have got a different answer.”
“ No, that I am sure he would not!”.
stoutly-
“I wanted her to sit to me for Eos-yes, Au-
rora-only the Greek name is so much the more
beautiful. I never saw a human being who was
such a bodily presentment of Morning; of
course,"—regretfully—“one could not give in
marble her look of dewy newness; she should
have been just stepping into her car. I have
got a splendid horse for her coursers; she
should have been throwing a kind look over her
shoulder back at poor old Tithonus.”
Anne's throat is certainly a little dry this
afternoon.

“And who sits for poor old Tithonus?”
“Oh, he is not there at all ; he is understood,
not expressed. However,"—with a vexed gest-
ure, and a resumption of his syringing—“she
would not, and there is an end on't. It is a
pity, for I have a sort of instinct that it would
have been the making of me!”
“That it would have been the making of
you!" repeats Mrs. Bligh thoughtfully.

CHAPTER XIII.
OF the two engagements made by Mrs. Bligh
on the evening of her return home, one yet re-
mains to be fulfilled, the Happy Evening for
Factory Girls in Poplar; and on the morning
upon which it falls due she sets out with no par-
ticular elation of spirit to fulfil it. Whatever
the evening may prove to the girls, she has not
much expectation of its being a “happy even-
ing” to her. Naturally a shy woman, her spirit
during the tedious transit in the sordid District
Railway is sinking ever lower and lower; and
as the last but one of the smoke-grimed stations
is reached and passed, she puts to her companion
a faltering query as to the topics she had best
choose, and the method to be adopted most cal-
culated to draw out the unknown and dreaded
objects of this her first spurt of philanthropy.
" I think you will find they do not need much
drawing out,” replies the other laughing, with
a dryness upon which Anne's after-experience
throws a lurid light.

They have reached their destination; a large
bare room, used indifferently for night schools,
committees, classes, and treats. It is aflare with
gas, and resounding with riotous female merri-
ment, of which two or three ladies, rendered
helpless by the overwhelming majority opposed
to them, are vainly trying to stem the tide.
Mrs. Bligh is aware that it is to supply the place
of one of the habitual workers in this loud field
of labour that her amateur services have been
asked. It now transpires that one or two more
of the ordinary staff have failed to appear, so
that it is with lamentably inadequate forces that
the little army of civilisation to-night takes the
field. The girls are evidently aware of and ex-
hilarated by this fact. They are rushing round
the room after one another in rude horseplay,
with facetious familiarity flinging their arms
round the visitors' waists, and gripping their
hands with fingers that would have made pale
the raven's wing. For a few moments Mrs.
Bligh stands bewildered and deafened, then
pulling herself together, she says to her intro-
ducer to this pandemonium, raising her voice to
something like a shout to enable herself to be
heard,
“Would it be possible to make them quieter

by reading to them?” The other shakes her
head.
“ Most of them would not be read to; if there
were enough of us we might draw a few of the
quieter ones into a second room and read to
them, but the majority prefer conversation.”
* Conversation !" repeats Anne, with a grimly
ironical smile, as a fresh burst of screeching
laughter and a fresh steeplechase over the
benches make the very walls ring; “and I
thought they wanted drawing out!”
They are better than they were !” replies
the other, apologetically. “One of them used
to stand on her head !" And then she dives
into the mélée, followed—though without much
idea of what she will do when she gets there-
by Anne.
But the obstreporousness of the fifty or sixty
half-savage girls, tied down all day to some sed-
entary occupation, and indemnifying themselves
generously now for the self-restraint of their
working hours, has got to a point far beyond the
very inadequate means of control at the disposal
of the visitors. It is, if anything, risen to a
higher storm pitch than ever, when the drama
takes a new development, through the arrival
on the scene, by a door into an adjoining room

in which—as it now appears—a missionary meet-
ing is being held, of an irate and remonstrant
curate.
“I must really beg you ladies to be so good
as to make a little less noise. The Bishop of
Mngundi is speaking, and it is impossible to hear
a word he says. His lordship is giving some
very interesting details about the Mngundi Mis-
sion, which are entirely lost."
The reproof is, indeed, a just one ; and the
poor, helpless ladies accept it with a meekness
that is almost tearful.
“It is most unfortunate! There are so few
of us to night, the girls seem to have got quite
out of hand. Oh, thank Heaven,”-in a new
key of relief and hope—“ here is Miss Capell
Smith! she is such a favourite with them !
perhaps she will be able to do something with
them.”
Miss Capell Smith! Pamela ! With a be-
wildered feeling that her ears—whose drums
might easily have given way under the strain
lately imposed upon them—must be playing her
false, Anne bends her look in the direction
whither, as she sees, most of the touzled heads
and beflowered hats are now turning; and rec-
ognises indeed in the figure making its smiling,

young friend.
joking way among them, her most unexpected
The good effect of her advent
makes itself almost instantaneously felt. The
senseless inarticulate noisemade merely for
noise's sake—which has hitherto prevailed, is
exchanged for loud expressions of welcome ;
and in the eagerness to hold her hand in their
dirty clasp, they discontinue their earlier pastime
of boxing and cuffing each other. With an
admiration which however does not impart the
power of imitation, Anne sees the well-carried
little high head turning this way and that among
the gigantic bangs; sees the delicate hand sur-
rendered, without the faintest indication of winc-
ing from the contact, to the embrace of fingers
none the less sticky for being extremely affec-
tionate. She has not even gloves on, and is in
the act of yielding up her rings with unforced
cheerfulness for examination, when Anne reaches
her side.
“Is Saul also among the prophets?” says
Mrs. Bligh, in a low voice, so as not to be heard
by the crowding girls, and raising her eyebrows
as she speaks.
" Anne !"
There is almost the old joy at the sight of
her friend, mixed with the extreme surprise of

Pamela's tone, almost and yet not quite. It is
as if a thin gauze were drawn over the real
pleasure of her tone. Anne laughs.
“We are most unflatteringly astonished to
find each other in the pursuit of good works. I
thought you were in the country.”
“So I am : I mean I came up only this after-
Do you think”—reproachfully—“ that if
I had been at home, I should not have been on
the doorstep of the dear little house to welcome

you?”
Anne gives a sort of start. The words are
identical with those used by the sculptor in ex-
plaining his failure to visit her. Neither of
them had come to welcome her, yet both have
employed the same almost exaggeratedly affec-
tionate phrase. Once before, as she now recalls,
she had been made reasonlessly uncomfortable
by a similar accidental identity of expression
between them.
“ The dear little house and the dear little
doorstep are still there; when will you come ?
I have something to say to you."
At the last clause of her speech a flash of
what looks like alarm comes into the girl's eyes.
“No bad news? nothing - nothing about
Anglesey ?”


## p. 228 (#232) ############################################

228
MRS. BLIGH.
Again Anne laughs drily.
“ Poor Anglesey! No, Anglesey is as well
as can be expected.”
But at this point Miss Capell Smith's atten-
tion is imperatively claimed by her young fac-
tory friends, who noisily demand the names and
value of the stones in her rings; and until the
'Happy Evening ” is over, no further private
talk is possible. But the humanising influence
of Pamela, aided by the other ladies, whom her
opportune arrival and exertions have enabled to
regain their breath and their wits, aided also to
the best of her ignorant ability by Anne, enables
the remainder of the “Recreation” to be passed
in a more reasonable manner than at its pande-
monic opening had seemed possible ; and no
further irruption of exasperated clergy from
the meeting next door is necessary.
When the end has come, and the lady work-
ers are hurrying to the District Railway Sta-
tion, whence they are to take their westward
way to their distant homes, Mrs. Bligh again
approaches Pamela.
“You will come to me tomorrow? At what
hour? I really have something to say to you.”
“I hope "—with a rather nervous inflection
-"that it is something pleasant."

“ But
“H'm! c'est selon; "what's one man's meat
is another man's poison !''
“ That always sounds to me such a difficult
proverb to pronounce," says Pamela giggling,
not quite like herself; "there are so many S's in
it!”
you
will come?"
“Of course I will; do I”—with a return to
some of the old tender expansiveness of manner
_"do I often need pressing when it is a ques-
tion of enjoying your society? I will”—laugh-
ing naturally this time—“ be on the dear door-
step while it is still being scoured!”
“That is all right; I am so—"
But at this point Mrs. Bligh's speech breaks
suddenly off, as she discovers, with an unavoid-
able shrinking from the contact, that one of the
factory girls is with coarse friendliness thrust-
ing her arm through hers. Several of them
have insisted on escorting the ladies to the sta-
tion. One has already tucked Anne's intro-
ducer under her arm; and shouts out to a com-
panion, apropos of Mrs. Bligh,
“There's a poor lidy with no one to look
arter 'er! Florry, you look arter 'er!”
Florry is not slow to comply, and screams
back-

MRS. BLIGH.
“I can't get 'old on 'er; she's got a cloak on!
Ah!"—triumphantly-“I'ave 'er now!"
Pamela is as good as her word. The door-
step is still in process of scouring next morning
when she presents herself upon it. She is shown
into the drawing-room, where Anne, with a
basin by her side, is on her knees beside the
most languishing of her sick palms, scrubbing it
with soap and water. She kisses her visitor
with a preoccupied air, and they both sit down
and look at each other. Pamela is the first to
break silence.
“ I was so surprised to see you last night!
Of course I know how radically kind-hearted
you are, but I did not think that Poplar was
quite your line of country! Did you take kind-
ly to it?"
Anne laughs.
" I sat one day at dinner by an Eton boy,
and seeing him make wry faces over a glass of
old port, I asked him whether he liked it ?
No,' he said; I hate it, but it makes me feel so
jolly!' I live in hopes of my good works mak-
ing me feel jolly in time "—in another key-
“One must fill one's life with something, when
it is so ludicrously empty as mine! but”-

hurrying on as if to avert the compassion the
last sentence might seem to ask for—" is not it a
new departure for you, too ?”
“Perhaps my life also is empty,” replies the
girl, with a rather impatient accent. “Well, no,
not exactly empty, but ”-looking embarrassed
_" when I came back from Wales, I felt so
upset and ‘no how,' you understand, that I
thought the best thing I could do was to take
up some practical work."
“I am afraid the good of the factory girls
was not the leading motive in either of our
minds."
“No, and yet "—with a lovely light of com-
passion in her starry eyes—“I am dreadfully
sorry for them; I should like to make their lives
a little less hideous."
"Oh, poor devils, I am sorry enough for
them too,” replies Anne, in a tone which be-
trays a good deal of compunction at her own
callousness. “ But to tell the truth,”-her in-
corrigible candour getting the upper hand
again—“ last night I was a good deal sorrier for
myself.”
The subject drops, and a silence which has
more of the awkward in it than would seem
likely in the case of intimacy such as theirs,

She pauses,
supervenes. Anne has resumed her squatting
attitude, and her sponging.
“I am afraid,” begins Pamela, “that my
time with you is limited, so if you have any-
thing you wish to say to me"
but the other is rubbing so vigorously that it
would seem she did not hear.
“Have you any.
thing you wish to say to me? or did I mis-
understand you last night?"
Mrs. Bligh drops her sponge with a flop into
the china bowl beside her, and looks her inter-
locutor straight between her eyes.
Why will not you sit to Sir Robert Coke?”
she asks, shooting out her question with the sud-
denness, and almost the violence of a projectile.
The thrust is so unexpected, that its victim
has no time to make ready weapons of defence,
or in any way protect or hide the small face,
which in an instant becomes a sheet of dazzling
blushes.
“ Has he told you, has he been--been com-
plaining of me?”
“ That is no answer to my question. No, of
course he has not been complaining of you;
it
would not be the least like him,"_indignantly-
“he is far too chivalrous. I learnt it indirectly.
But why will not you sit to him ? ”


## p. 233 (#237) ############################################

MRS. BLIGH.
233
The tone in which this demand is made is so
far more imperative than its utterer has any idea
of, that Pamela laughs nervously.
“ Is it Anne?” she asks, holding up her hands
with a half playful, half frightened gesture of
warding off a threatened attack, “or is it Queen
Eleanor with the dagger and the bowl ?”
Mrs. Bligh has by this time risen to her feet,
and is standing over her disciple still uncon-
sciously gripping her sooty sponge.
“ It cannot be prudery," she says, as if ad-
dressing herself rather than the girl. “I have
never seen the least trace in you of that con-
temptible quality ; and besides there would be
no place for it. You would have your step-
mother, or your maid, or that old governess of
yours—I can't remember her name—during the
whole of your sittings.”
“Yes, of course I might,” nervously mur-
muring this assent.
Perhaps you are afraid of the irksomeness
and fatigue of having to keep in one position
for so long?"continues Anne, her unconsciously
commanding tone changing into one of eager
persuasion. “But he would be most considerate
to you; he would let you rest as often as you
liked, and you would have his conversation to

distract you. Many women "—with a gallantly
swallowed sigh-“ admired women-women
very much in the world, would think it no great
hardship to have him to talk to them for an
hour, or a couple of hours at a time.” There is
not even an indistinct murmur in answer this
time, only a red silence. “ You think that you
are doing a good work,” continues the other,
her voice swelling with indignation at the dumb
resistance offered to her arguments, “ when you
allow those factory girls to drag you about, and
claw
you;
and
you
do not seem to see how very
much greater an act of charity it would be to
give essential help at a critical moment-with
so little cost to yourself too-to a man of real
genius!"
Apparently her friend's attitude-standing
in such heat of expostulation over her, and wav-
ing the soapy sponge above her head is more
than Pamela can bear, for she now springs up
and betakes herself to the window, where she
stands with her back to the room, and whence
a sound of uncomfortable remonstrant laughter
now makes itself heard.
“ Dearest Anne, what gross exaggeration !
Essential help!”
“I suppose," resumes. Anne, beginning to

march about the homely little room with her
hands behind her, “ that the same thing happens
to almost every genuine artist. In most of their
lives there comes a moment when the fire seems
to burn low ; when the spring ceases to run; a
moment of exhaustion ; and then, unless some
new inspiration comes, something to start them
again, to give them a fresh filip, a new lease of
artistic life-
“ And is it possible that you mean to imply
that I can do all this for him?"
The girl's
voice is quivering, and the colour burns in two
fixed blazing patches under her eyes, but she
looks her companion full and directly in the
face.
“I do not know whether you can, but I
know that he thinks you can; which comes to
much the same thing. Oh, do consent!"-drop-
ping the unheeded sponge at last on the carpet,
and gripping Pamela's wrists—“or if you will
not, at least give a reason for your refusal; any
reason, even a bad one; come, I will take even
a bad one-a bad one!"
There is a pause. The elder woman's face,
not quite unlovable in its expressive plainness,
is dyed in a hue as deep though not as lovely as
hers whom she so urgently apostrophises.

“ Is it possible,” says the latter, bringing out
the question with low-voiced difficulty, “that
you really wish me to sit to him ?”
Anne laughs rather harshly.
“ It is a little late in the day to ask that! Do
you suppose, then, that I have been joking all
this time? Do I look, do I sound as if I were
in joke? but come,”-giving the other's slender
captive wrists an impatient jog—"your reason,
if you have one, which I am beginning gravely
to doubt!”
“My reason,” repeats Pamela, turning her
head from side to side, as if looking for some
way of escape; but finding none, pulls herself
together, and says with a heavy sighing breath,
in a hurried low voice, "since you will have my
reason, it was that 1-1-was afraid."
Afraid ! Afraid of what?”
“Of-of-myself !”
An oppressive silence of several moments;
so oppressive that Pamela finds even explana-
tory speech preferable.
“ I need not dilate to you, who know him so
well, upon his attractiveness. If I sat to him I
should have to see a great deal of him; you
know his caressing manner to women, it means
nothing, less than nothing, but I was afraid of

getting too much sous le charme. I do not think
I have a stronger brain than other girls, and I
was afraid that I might-I might-lose my
head!"
Her utterance is rapid and very low; and
here she stops, dropping her eyelids and blush-
ing intolerably. Mrs. Bligh has let loose her
hold upon her young friend's hands and stepped
back a pace; each of her dark eyes seems to
have secreted a burning coal in its pupil. Pa-
mela has told her the truth, but not the whole
truth; one, and the more important half of it,
she has suppressed, out of regard to her friend's
feelings. On the simple page of that fair and
loyal face before her Mrs. Bligh reads the inno-
cent secret, that what Pamela has feared more
than the loss of her own heart, is the filching of
that one which she has—alas, so erroneously,
believed to be, or at least have been Anne's pos-
session. The feelings awakened by this dis-
covery are of too potent a nature to make utter-
ance easy, or at first even possible. But by-and-
by she manages—though she does not quite
know how she gets hold of it—to speak in a re-
spectably steady voice, and with a grave smile.
“I think you were still more afraid that
some one else might lose his head! But,”-she

pauses for a second, then resumes still more
steadily than before—“why should you be afraid
of that?"
“But I am not,” cries poor Pamela, in an
agonised voice, the carmine usually limited to
lips and cheeks deluging every visible inch of
her. “Do not for a moment suppose that I was
implying anything so fatuous. I am speaking-
thinking-only of myself. Do not, for heaven's
sake, put such an interpretation on my words!
It would be too too_fatuous!"
She breaks off choked with maiden shame.
Anne has in her turn fled to the window, and
in feverish absence of mind tweaked off one of
the blossoms from a sole and expensive pot of
lilies of the valley. Then she comes back, puts
her arms round Pamela, and kisses her almost
solemnly.
“There is nothing fatuous in it,” she says, in
a tone of great kindness. “It is most probable,
and-and-most to be desired !”
“Oh, no, no,”— with almost tearful empha-
sis—“ it is most improbable, and most to be un-
desired! He can't help saying pretty graceful
things to other women, but it is you, you, who
are his real object_his real devotion.”
Anne passes her hand over her forehead.

The words so sincerely meant sound with a
horrible irony in her ears.
“My dear child," she says, mastering herself
with great difficulty, “ you have said those sort
of things till you believe them. Let me ear-
nestly beg of you, once for all, to credit me
when I assure you upon my honour that Sir
Robert Coke and I are friends and good com-
rades, nothing more! what should we be more
indeed ? I am very proud "-almost loudly-
"of being his good comrade. We like each
other as two men might; two very nice men.
He is a very nice man, and"-smiling—“it is
more my misfortune than my fault that I am
not a very nice man too."
And thus it comes to pass that Miss Capell
Smith consents to sit to Sir Robert Coke. She
does not stay long after her shy and remorseful
consent has been wrung out of her, but short as
the interval is, it seems long to Anne. The sort
of awkwardness which, as both now realise, has
been growing up between them ever since the
sculptor's shadow fell upon their friendship,
and which had melted under the fire of their
joint excitement half an hour ago, settles down
upon them again despite all their efforts. With
a sigh of relief Anne hears the hall-door shut

behind her guest. She is standing before the
fire, and as her eyes meet her eyes in the Chip-
pendale looking-glass, a grim smile breaks over
her face, as with an expressive gesture, as of
one who has cut her own throat, she passes her
forefinger along its surface from ear to ear.
“ It will be brought in Felo de Se !” says she,
speaking out loud, according to her wont. Then
she sits down upon the floor again, and finishes
washing her palm.

CHAPTER XIV.
ANNE Bligh loses no time in informing her
sculptor of the good turn she has done him.
The first draft of the note in which she does so
runs thus :-
“DEAR FRIEND,—Your Eốs has been brought
to hear reason. You will find her now willing
to throw a smile over her shoulder at old Titho-
nus.-.Your Deus ex machina,
“ A. BLIGH.”
She reads it over complacently at first ; with
less satisfaction a second time; then tears it up.
“ It is ungenerous to sneer at his
age.

unattractive." She takes another sheet.

Capell Smith to sit to you. Will you communi. .

Her pen has halted a little over the "yours
ever." It is his invariable signature to her,
which she has with hesitating pleasure adopted.
But would not it be well to alter it now?
would be truer with an ‘N’ before it yours
never.'” Then she thinks of that Mr. Moddle's

laughs out loud, and, with just a passing wish
that she had never adopted it, lets the usual
never
formula go.
For the next day or two she is the prey
of a
dread which sometimes wears the face of a hope
that he will come and thank her in person. But
he does not. He sends her his gratitude in a
prompt and ecstatic note, in which he calls her
his dear "little friend and his good angel”;
handsome expressions which scarcely fill her
with the joy they would have done had they
been spontaneous, and not the acknowledgment
of the particular kind of service rendered by
her. The billet contains also the expression of
an eager wish to come and see her, and talk
over things, as soon as he can find a moment's
breathing space.
But as the days go by it becomes evident
that that breathing-space has not and probably
will not be reached. Her common-sense com-

ing to her aid, she gives up hurrying home,
breaking through every other engagement to
be back at her own tea-table by five o'clock.
The private view day of the Royal Academy,
for which he has sent her tickets, has arrived ;
and she has neither seen nor heard anything
further of Coke, or his intending model. Prob-
ably on that general meeting-ground of the
smart, the artistic, and the frumpy she will
come across them both. But she comes across
neither, for the excellent reason that neither is
there. Is it, she asks herself—as she walks
through the crowded rooms alone—for she has
hampered herself with
no companion-is it
merely that shyness and dread of overheard
comment and disparagement which keeps a
good many sensitive artists away, or a con-
sciousness that his work this year is not up to
its usual mark—that is accountable for his
absence.
The sculpture room is always empty ; so that,
as she tells herself, the fact that no one is look-
ing at Coke's 'Marsyas' when she nears it is
no indication of insuccess. She walks round
group, and with rather a sinking heart
observes how insignificant is the flaw in the
marble back, how inadequate an excuse for the
the

purchaser's refusal to take it.
She is regard-
ing it somewhat ruefully, when some one touches
her on the arm, and looking round with a start,
and with Heaven knows what sudden expecta-
tion, she sees Lady St. George.
How are you? I do not care about it, do
you? There is something strained in the atti-
tude ; but between you and me, I cannot stand
modern sculpture; only”—with a knowing nod
I do not tell our friend so. But”—with ani-
mation--“do tell me where 1463 is? A bust-
they are all so alike-and so hideous! But they
tell me it is the thing to look at-quite a new
man. Young, and was a stone-mason; picked
up by the wife of the Squire of his parish ; quite
a working man. I have no doubt he puts his
knife halfway down his throat-but I must get
hold of him.”
Mrs. Bligh helps her friend to find 1463 ;
owns grudgingly that it is not bad for a begin-
ner; and goes home in spirits that would be yet
more dispirited than they are, were she not sup-
ported in some measure by the thought that by
next year the effect of the new inspiration to
which she herself has been the means of helping
her sculptor will be triumphantly displayed to
the world. And meanwhile reason tells her

245
that she must construct her life without any
reference to him.
It seems hard that the having done one of
her two most intimate friends a service should
have robbed her of both, but as the weeks slip
by she has sardonically to allow to herself that
something not unlike this paradoxical result has
been attained.
Yet Coke does pay his promised visit after a
while; but as ill-luck would have it-HE may
call it good-luck, is her after-reflection-one or
two of her not very numerous acquaintances
have chosen the same day and hour to visit her;
and though, as he rises to take leave after half
an hour of trivial general chat, she cannot keep
out of her eyes an entreaty to him to outstay
her other guests, he either does not see, or dis-
regards the dumb request. All she learns from
that tantalising snatch of his company is, that
he is in admirable looks and spirits, and appears
in no wise annoyed at his failure to secure a
tête-à-tête.
As to Miss Capell Smith, whose exaggerated
estimate of herself, and insatiable thirst for her
society, had till lately filled her with protesting
wonder, it is but in snatches that she catches
a glimpse of her also. She runs in now and

again, but though extremely, and as it strikes
Anne, remorsefully affectionate in her manner,
she is always in a hurry, and never quite at her
She does not volunteer, nor can Mrs.
Bligh bring herself to ask any information as to
the sittings, which the elder woman knows to be
now in full swing. Pamela has had no gout to
get the better of; and she is nineteen instead of
fifty, and yet, or the other fancies it, there is a
near kinship between the thinly-veiled exuber-
ance of life and joy in the more than mature
man and the scarcely-ripe girl. “It is certainly
coming," Anne says to herself, with a dry sob,
which makes Tory give a short bark of interest
and surprise. “If I am not a perfect fool I shall
get my life into some sort of shape before it
comes.”
Nor does the resolution end in words. Day
by day she tries more and more earnestly to give
it effect in action; seeking with feverish eagerness
to find channels into which to pour that energy
of being and fulness of feeling for which she has
now no natural outlets afforded. To the sur-
prise of the acquaintance who had introduced
her to that sphere of labour, and witnessed her
excessive distaste for it, she asks to be allowed
to repeat her visits to Poplar, and though she

can never be said to become very fond of the
factory girls, yet it grows with her into a habit
to forego her dinner every Monday night in
order to cut out skirts and jackets for those
boisterous young operatives—a share of the
work which she has asked for as being most
within her powers and to discover how unex-
pectedly particular and difficult to please they
are as to the fit of those garments.
Nor does she confine herself to the factory
hands. Charity organisation lays a claw upon
her. She dabbles in “friendly girls” and “lost
mothers,” and “cabmen." Nor is it philan-
thropy alone that absorbs her in her quest of an
existence of many-sided interests. She attends
three courses of lectures; she eagerly follows
up any opening that may lead to a widening of
her narrow social circle. In London, probably
more than in any other capital, the golden rule
of “cutlet for cutlet” holds sway; and as the
last census revealed the inconvenient richness in
womankind of the British Isles, represented by
a surplus of nine hundred thousand fair ones,
there is naturally no great demand for an undin-
ner-giving, unillustrious, unbeautiful solitary
woman. But she accepts the few entertain-
ments that are offered to her; and, as she does

her best to make herself pleasant at them, they
lead to more. Thus the weeks pass, and the
month of poetic name and associations; the
month of cuckoo and nightingale; often, also,
of bitter breath and pinching easterly airs; the
month when the Derby is run; and the mission-
aries “from the plains of Timbuctoo" throng
Exeter Hall; and the lilac has its brief span of
exquisite life, draws to a close.
Mrs. Bligh has not yet reached that stage of
existence when life goes by electric telegraph.
At twenty-nine it has not more than the speed
of the Flying Dutchman; and of late it has been
going more slowly than usual, through being so
much more and more variously filled. Much
slower, for instance, than during the last three
uneventful weeks of her visit to the Mulhol-
lands.
The Mulhollands! How little they have
been in her thoughts of late is brought home to
her when, on letting herself into her house one
afternoon, she finds her parlour-maid spelling
out the florid message of regret at having
missed her, scratched on a card left a few min.
utes before by Czar.
He is up then, embarked on his career of
pleasure, in his comfortable bachelor rooms;

and having left his long-suffering family behind
him with as little compunction as he had left the
spring cabbages and peas in his garden. Her
indignation at his selfishness prevents her from
taking any notice either of him or his pencilled
despair. In a few more days he has passed ut-
terly out of her head.
One morning early in June she is at her bu-
reau, puzzling over the accounts of a charitable
society which she has undertaken to keep in or-
der during the absence, through illness, of its
secretary. The pugs are sitting in the window,
with their backs turned to her, looking like a
couple of Morland's pigs. Tory is sitting up-
right, as a sort of protest against her mistress's
absolute refusal to saddle herself with her weight
upon her lap. Sall is occasionally trying with
hand and mouth to catch a torpid blue-bottle on
the pane. Both are bored and désoeuvré. But all
of a sudden they spring to their feet, breaking
into a storm of barks, which are taken up and
answered by other dog-voices from below.
Mrs. Bligh asks them to stop, but since they
pay no attention, being as disobedient as wom-
en's dogs always are, she puts her fingers re-
signedly in her ears and goes on counting. But
after the lapse of a minute or two, she becomes

aware that the door has opened, and visitors,
whose names, thanks to her stopped ears, she
has not caught, are being announced.
Who can be sufficiently intimate with her to
call upon her at eleven in the morning ? She is
not long left in doubt.
“I do not know what you will say to our
bringing the dogs!” says Mrs. Mulholland, ap-
pearing in the doorway, followed by her daugh-
ter and step-daughter, the former bearing her
beloved Fezy, in a state of overpowering agita-
tion at the sight of the pugs, and the latter lead-
ing Jim in a string; “but we did not dare to
leave them at the hotel; they have got us into
sad hot water already!"
Jim would not have thought of biting that
idiot of a waiter, if he had sat down at once,"
cries Lucile, indignantly. “You remember he
never can bear to see any one that he does not
know, standing up; if he had sat down at
oncer"
“I am afraid”-in laughing interruption-
“that waiters, as a rule, cannot do much sitting
down!”
" And I daresay the invalid lady whom Fezy
kept awake all night with his barking is not
much of an invalid really,” cries Sue, warmly;

“and if they send him down stairs to sleep in
the kitchen to-night, they shall send me too!
We will be found dead in each other's arms
among the blackbeetles !” They all laugh.
“He had better take a bed here; I wish"-
hospitably—“you could all take beds here! I
had not an idea that you were up. I was out
when Czar called."
“I think,”—says Mrs. Mulholland, with a
mildly reproachful tinge in her good-natured
voice—“that he was a little bit piqued at your
taking no notice of his card. His lady friends,
as a rule, are so very empressé. He is too proud
to say so; but I think he rather expected you to
ask him to have a cup of tea, or-
Anne feels herself growing guiltily pink.
“I should not have ventured to invite such a
swell! I know he is always so overwhelmed
with engagements.”
Czar's wife hesitates.
“He has not quite so many invitations this
year as he expect-as usual; his friends do not
seem to be giving much; they are all very
smart people, and have shut up their houses on
account of the royal mourning!"
Anne struggles with a smile at the ingenuity
that has evidently been needed by the old gen-

tleman in reconciling the discrepancy between
his rose-coloured accounts of his own popularity
and the actual fact.
“And so he brought you all up to console
him!”
Again Mrs. Mulholland hesitates, and there
is evidently a slight struggle in her mind before
she replies.
“Well, no, he did not bring us up, much as
he would have liked it; the fact is, we are up
for a week on the strength of a cheque sent me
by an eccentric old cousin of Czar's, with the
stipulation that it should be spent entirely on a
treat for me and the children! Of course, one
must not look a giſt horse in the mouth; but we
were all a little indignant at her excluding poor
Czar so pointedly. However, he took it very
sweetly, and begged us to enjoy ourselves.”
“ There is very little doubt”-smiling openly
this time—"about your being able to oblige him
in that particular !"
“Oh no, of course not; only"-with a rather
harassed look—“unfortunately we all want to
go different ways. Lucile to South Kensington
and the Military Tournament; Sue to Westmin.

Stores, and"—with a rueful glance at Jim and

Fezy, to whom the pugs are making advances
of mixed ire and coquetry—“there are so few
places where dogs are admitted.”
“London is not a nice place for dogs; I”—
doubtfully—“am a little surprised at your
bringing them up.”
“Well, you see, Sue never will be separated
from Fezy."
“ He would break his heart if I were to de-
sert him," cries the little girl, interrupting her
darling in the marked homage he is paying to
Tory by snatching him up in her arms, “and
then I should break iny heart, and we should be
buried in one grave!"
“ And we would put over you, “they were
noisy and unpleasant in their lives,'” &c., inter-
jects Lucile, laughing.
Anne laughs too.
“Fezy, I own, is accounted for; but why
Jim?”.
George asked us to bring him up to meet
him.”
“George is in London too?”
“Yes, he is on his way to his new agency,
buying things for his house."
“ His agency? His house?” in a tone of
surprised interest.

MRS. BLIGH.
“Oh yes, I was forgetting; you have not
heard our great news. George has got a land
agency; it appears that he is a wonderful judge
of timber, which seems to be a thing that is born
with you,
and that you cannot acquire; and on
the strength of that and his being so good at ac-
counts, Mr. Blank"
The nice man who brought us down from
the slate quarries on his engine"-puts in Sue,
explanatorily—“ has got him a sub-agency. Poor
fellow, we are all so glad for him.”
“And so am I," heartily.
“ As his chief lives on another estate, he is to
have his house; a capital house I am told, al-
most too good "—with a meaning look—“ for a
lonely bachelor."
That meaning smile, reflected in the girls'
faces, tells Mrs. Bligh that hope of the attain-
ment of their Blue Rose has revived in the
minds of the Mulholland family; that Blue Rose
which her own late action has made it more out
of the question than ever for them to pluck.
The consciousness of this fact makes her feel at
once so shabby and so regretful, that she finds
no words with which to hint to them that their
castle is built on the sand ; and Mrs. Mulholland
resumes in a contented voice,

“He is in great spirits, poor boy. He is
coming to tell you himself; he always fancied
that you did not think him good for much, so it
is quite a little triumph for him. Do not let him
know that we have been beforehand with him.
Be very much surprised. Ah! here he is !" as
the sound of the front-door bell is heard once
again, moving the ire of the parlour-maid with
its electric tremor, unwonted and unreckoned-
for in the forenoon.
“I do not know whether I can manage being
surprised; but I shall not have the slightest dif-
ficulty in being pleased,” rejoins Anne, turning
a face, dressed out in compunctious congratu-
lations, towards the door, to be ready to greet
the expected arrival.
But if Mrs. Bligh's congratulations are need-
ed, they will have to be new-shaped to fit the
requirements of a different object from the one
looked for. George Mulholland would not
bound into the room unannounced, in a hat
wreathed with roses; nor pull himself up dead
short in the middle of the room, with a little
“Oh!” of consternation, at the sight of his
mother and sisters.
The first glance at Pamela Capell Smith's
face tells Anne that she has come to make that
17

announcement, which, as Mrs. Bligh has daily
and hourly told herself, can have no element of
surprise, much less shock for her when it comes;
since there is no moment of her waking hours in
which she does not expect it. She is the one of
the awkwardly silent group who pales instead of
reddening.
“I did not know. I had not an idea," stam-
mers Pamela, recovering her speech first but
imperfectly.
“We are such country cousins, that every
body is astonished to see us in London,” says
Mrs. Mulholland, with an air of stiff dignity,
which sits oddly on her; “but I do not see why
we should not have our fling as well as our
neighbours! We have paid you a visitation ”-
turning to Anne and beginning to refasten the
lace cloak—an obvious fruit of the cousin's leg-
acy, which in the warm room she has let drop
upon her ample shoulders.
“Lucile, put Jim's
muzzle on again."
" Jim," repeats Pamela, in a rather moved
voice; “is Jim here too?"
Then, as he is drawn forth from beneath the
sofa to which he has retired to avoid the hoy-
denish overtures of Sall and Tory, she puts out
her hand to stroke him; but some inward emo-

tion makes her change her intention, and she
contents herself with saying gently,
“ Poor dear Jim; he does not look much like
a London dog."
“ He does not wish to!” cries Lucile-in-
ducting, as she speaks, his reluctant pink nose
and blinking eyes into their horrid little leather
cage—“he would not if he could; he hates Lon-
don."
“We have brought him up to meet George!
He is to live with George at his agency.
.
George has got an agency !” explains Sue,
eagerly, mentioning the name and giving the
information which her elders have wished, but
felt their perfect inability to introduce and im-
part. They glance gratefully at her.
“George has got an agency!” repeats Pa-
mela in a tone of lively interest, not unmixed
with astonishment. “Oh!”-turning towards
George's relatives with a sort of diffidence as
to the manner in which her congratulations may
be received—“I am so glad.”
“We are all glad,” replies Mrs. Mulholland,
still stiffly, but with indications of a temptation
to thaw ; “ he most of all! It was never his
wish to be idle! Come, girls, are you ready?”
They file out; women, child, dogs, bidding

a formal adieu to Miss Capell Smith, as they
pass her; a formal one, all but Sue, who, yield-
ing to the instincts of an ineradicably kind heart,
and thinking that the culprit looks snubbed, in-
sists on both Jim and Fezy shaking hands tor-
dially with her. Anne accompanies her visitors
to the hall-door, partly to do them honour, partly
also from an unavowed wish to defer for yet a
few moments longer the reception of those tid-
ings which she knows that Pamela is feverishly
waiting to impart.
But the adieux of the hurried little party,
hastening to begin the cramming of a season's
enjoyment into their one brief week, cannot be
prolonged beyond two or three minutes; and
however slowly she may mount her stairs, she
gets back to the drawing-room before she can
find any confidence that her armour against the
coming blow is half braced on. She finds Miss
Capell Smith standing in the middle of the
room, evidently in too great a tremor of nerves
to sit down. The moment that her hostess ap-
pears she breaks out into eager speech.
“Never, never will I burst in upon you unan-
nounced again! I would have given anything
not to have met them here to-day!”
“ It was unlucky.”

“How cold they were to me! all but Sue.
Dear little Sue! What a beautiful nature that
child has ?"
It is obvious to Mrs. Bligh that she is not
alone in her desire to put off the crucial mo-
ment. Pamela is evidently trying to shirk it
too. But since it must come, it had better
come at once.
“ You did not" - with a strained smile-
come here to talk to me about Sue?”
“ Did not I?”
“You have something more interesting to
say?"
“ Have I?"
The girl has turned her back to her friend,
in obedience as the friend feels to that elemen-
tary law of humanity, which teaches you when
you are thrusting five inches of cold steel into
the heart or vanity of a fellow-creature, not to
look at him or her while you are doing it.
“I am a true prophet then? It is settled ?"
Mrs. Bligh's stairs are short and easy! It
cannot be the climbing them that has made her
so ridiculously short of breath. Pamela is
stooping over Mrs. Bligh's modestly furnished
silver table, fidgettingly handling the little ob-
jects upon it.

MRS. BLIGH.
" It is all your doing!” she says in an agi-
tated low voice. “I owe it all to you! You
first suggested the idea! But for you such a
thought would never have crossed my brain.”
All her doing. The listener neither accepts
nor disclaims the imputed glory. She is realis-
ing what a large difference there is between hav-
ing the sword hung at ever so small a distance
above your head, and the same sword actually
slicing the tendons and arteries of your neck.
“Do you remember that day in Beaumaris
Castle, when you snatched the lots out of my
hand?"—not looking up, and speaking very
quickly.
“Yes, I remember!" I am so likely to for-
get-aside.
“ You said that I was meat for George's mas-
ters! It came upon me with a flash that you
might mean him. Did you?”—with a ring of
anxiety in her voice—“I am almost sure that
you did!”
“ Yes, I meant him.”
Mrs. Bligh will be able, so she tells herself,
to manage something more than these stupid
assents in a moment or two.
“But it was only a flash!” continues the
other, “and it passed in a second; in fact, I was

deadly ashamed of its ever having crossed my
mind!”
“ Yes?”
“ And then a little later on we stayed in the
same country house for a Sunday, and he
seemed to make a good deal of me, but I tried to
think it meant nothing! You see”—a slight
pause—“I had got a stupid mistaken idea in my
head, built upon nothing but my own silly fan-
cies"
She breaks off; and though Mrs. Bligh
knows that the labouring sentence's drift is to
try and convince her that her own conduct has
given no colour to the silly fancies alluded to,

cult “ Yes?"
“I was so afraid of giving way to my--my
feeling for him, that I made up my mind I
would avoid every chance of meeting him; and
then I saw you át Poplar, and you told me to
come and see you, and as, no doubt, you remem-
ber, you asked me to sit to him-begged it of
me as a personal favour to yourself; as a per-
sonal favour to yourself, that was what decided
me, and since then”-her lovely face drooping

“Last night; do you think”-enthusiastical-
ly—“that I should be likely to delay in telling
you—you to whom I owe him! Yes ”_ with
moistening eyes and unsteady voice_“we both
feel that you have given us to each other.”
Mrs. Bligh breaks into what may pass mus-
ter for a laugh.
“ I always knew that I was of a very gener-
ous turn!”—then, with a sudden change of key,
“you are a foolish child, and you put it rath-
er too strongly, but I have—yes, I have”-
her voice gaining in firmness—"tried to be a
friend to you—both.”
“There never was such a friend !” cries the
excited girl, half crying. “He says so; he says
that if anyone you loved committed a murder
you would hide him under your bed! He says
that the phrase "True as steel' must have been
made expressly for you, he says-
A sort of shiver passes over Anne. These
phrases of repeated encomium are almost intol-
erably painful to her. To stem them she says
abruptly :-
“ And you—you now feel that something

fore, and which poor George, with the best in-

spire!”
A tiny cloud just skims over Pamela's ra-
diant brow.
“I do not know what I feel. I am all in a
whirl! Sometimes the honour and the respon-
sibility seem almost more than I can bear!
Never, never would such a presumptuous idea
have entered my head if you had not put it
there; you dear, dear Anne;" throwing herself
into her friend's arms—“it is all your doing !”

CHAPTER XV.
Miss CAPELL SMITH's expansive outbreak
precedes, by a very few minutes, her departure.
When she is gone—her hostess accompanies her
also to the hall-door-that hostess stands before
the empty fireplace, and looks into the depths of
that chimney glass, to which, in her solitary life,
she has acquired the habit of making confi-
dences. “You dear dear Anne!” she says out
loud, in a mocking voice to the image which
the mirror gives her back, “it is all your do-
ing!” and repeating again more slowly, “ You
dear dear Anne, what an astonishing fool you
have been ;” she drops into an arm-chair, and
though the accounts of the charitable society
still remain unravelled out on her bureau, lies
limp and idle for a while.
Not a long while, however, since her morn-
ing's trials are not yet over. It is not much past
noon when the door-bell sounds yet a third
time; and she has only just succeeded in get-
ting her countenance into some sort of order-

not, indeed, that she has any tear-traces to re-
move-when “Mr. George Mulholland” is an-
nounced. During the last half-hour her pity for
him has been wholly submerged in her warm
compassion for herself, but it revives with a
stab when she sees how indescribably smartened
up and brightened he looks, how good a frock
coat he wears—the cousin's legacy again, doubt-
less—and with how alert and hopeful an air,
and how little of the clodpole he enters. As he
shakes her hand his eye wanders beyond her,
evidently in search of some expected and not
found object.
“I–I met my people just now,” he begins,
"they told me that—that-
“That I should be delighted to see you!”
replies Anne, hastily, finishing his sentence for
him in a way which, as she is well aware, is not
the one that he intended. His eye, growing
disappointed, still rambles. He had, it is plain,
hoped to find Pamela still here. Is it as a pro-
pitiatory offering for her that he has brought
the magnificent bunch of Marshal Niel roses
which occupy his left hand ?
“What superb roses !” she says, for the sake
of saying something, after they are both seated.
“Do you like them?” he answers, holding

them out rather diffidently to her. “I thought
that perhaps you might. I remembered how
fond of flowers you were at Plas Drow.”
They were not meant for Pamela, then. He
has bought them expressly for her, out of the
legacy, too, probably! Is there no way of stop-
ping him from making these repeated coal fires
on the top of her guilty head? And what a re-
turn she has to make to him! These thoughts
are working such havoc in her mind and man-
ners that she entirely forgets to put out an an-
swering hand to receive the offered nosegay.
Instead of taking it, she cries out to the surprise
and consternation of the would be donor,
“Oh, but this is really too dreadful!"
Then, seeing the dismayed astonishment in
the young man's face at this extraordinary
mode of reception, she recollects herself and
stammers awkwardly, “I believe that I am get-
ting Aphasia-is not Aphasia the saying the ex-
act opposite of what you intend? Of course, I
mean how beautiful, how delightful!"
But George is naturally not deceived by
this extremely lame explanation.
Why should there be anything dreadful in
my giving you a few roses?” he asks, with a
troubled voice, in which there seems to be a

sort of forecast of misfortune. “Is it-have
you "_bringing out the words at first stammer-
ingly, and then with a blurt—"is it that you
have been doing me any more ill-turns?”
His words make certain what she has all
along suspected, that he is aware of the part
she has had in his disaster; nor does she in any
way try to rebut the accusation. She lays
down the Marshal Niels, whose cool stalks seem
to burn her palm. She cannot tell him while
holding his flowers in her hand. Obeying the
humane rule lately put in practice by Pamela
for her benefit, Mrs. Bligh keeps her eyes avert-
ed while she deals her blow.
“ It is too late—it is out of my power now,
for me to do you either a good or an ill turn!”
“What do you mean?” hurriedly.
“I mean,” still looking away, and almost
running her words into each other in her eager-
ness to get the communication over, " that the
reason why Pamela came here this morning was
to announce her engagement to Sir Robert
Coke!”
She ends, and still with lowered eyes waits
ith lips compressed as if to bear an expected
prick of pain for the words of disappointment
and bitter sorrow which will surely follow. But

none such, not even an inarticulate ejaculation
came. He is taking his punishment silently, as a
man should. She steals an anxious glance in his
direction. He is standing in exactly the same at-
titude as when first he had entered the room ;
but the whole look of brightness and smartness
has disappeared. Even his frock coat seems to
have collapsed. Since she is looking at him it
is evident that he thinks she is expecting him to
say something, so after an obvious struggle he
speaks.
“ It was always your plan; of course you
are glad.”
She winces. Is this his revenge? this iron-
ical assertion of her joy in her successful la-
bours. But a second glance at his face assures
her that he has had no such ironical intention,
that the speech is uttered in all good faith, and
that he is much too smothered and swallowed up
in his own woe to have the most distant suspi-
cion of hers.
"I-I thought it better you should know at
once,” she murmurs miserably.
“ Thank you ; yes, of course-certainly-it is
better!"
He moves as he speaks, and turning, seems
to be searching for his hat, with a gesture as of

one who did not see very well. She divines
what it is that has for the moment obscured his
strong young sight, divines also his anxiety that
she should not guess the cause. She helps him
to look for his hat, and in a moment or two it is
found. Holding it in one hand he offers her the
other.
“I am no worse off than I was before!” he
says, with a gallant attempt at a smile. "One
cannot lose what one never possessed.”
The mixed self-respect and magnanimity
which, as she feels, have dictated this speech are
more than she can bear.
“It was inexcusable in me to meddle !" she
cries, in an irrepressible outbreak of remorse.
“ It is too late now, and I daresay you will not
believe me, but if you knew how deeply, deeply
I regret-
“ You need not,” he answers, with more dig-
nity than she could have thought him capable
of. “I think better of her than to believe that
if she had one spark of real liking for me, she
could have been turned against me by a com-
parative stranger, after all these years!”
The succession of strong emotions—all dis-
agreeable—which Mrs. Bligh has experienced
during the brief compass of one forenoon, pro-

duce in her the not unnatural result of a bad head-
ache. It is not bad enough to justify taking it
to bed, but is yet by dinner-time bad enough to
make the thoughts of an evening party to which
she is engaged particularly irksome. Were the
party in question given by a prosperous mem-
ber of society, she would not hesitate to refuse
it the insignificant boon of her company. But
as on the contrary it is the struggling effort at
festivity of the wife of a far from successful art-
ist, who had invited her viva voce, and with a
profusion of apologies for the humility of the
entertainment, her kind heart forbids her to
yield to her ardent desire to shirk it.
To set off to an evening party, when you have
not preceded it by dining out, always needs an
exertion. The cold blooded dressing after din-
ner, at an hour when nature bids you put off
your artificial weeds, instead of enduing them,
becomes yet more trying, when you face it
alone. It is therefore with a very jaded feeling
of deep self-pity that Anne steps into her hired
brougham, and joggles off to Metheglin Road
in Kensington beyond Jordan. She finds the
studio in which the entertainment is chiefly tak-
ing place so full of people that she regrets her
unneeded philanthropy.

They are very odd-looking people; shaggy
men, and queerly bedizened ill-combed women.
As she recognises no acquaintances among
them, she employs herself in looking at the pic-
tures, of which the atelier contains a painful
plenty. She knows that three or four have
been refused by the Academy, and is reflecting
how very little worse they are than some of the
triumphant daubs she has lately seen hanging
on the line at Burlington House, when an affect-
ed and familiar voice sounds in her ear.
"Que diable, Mrs. Nan, va-t'elle faire dans cette
galère ?"
She turns round with a start, but recovering
herself, retorts with a smile-
“ Que diable, M. Czar, va-t'il faire dans cette
galère ?"
“ You may well ask!”—with a shrug.
“ You
do not suppose,"—in anxious haste to explain
away his appearance in Metheglin Road—“that
I am often to be caught among such a set of
ragamuffins; but one does a thing of the kind,
once in a blue moon,' for a lark! Though you
would not believe it,”—laughing—"I have a
strong streak of the Bohemian in me, and one
likes to be kind."
“ Yes."

“But now that we have found one another-
ah, here are a couple of chairs—we can be inde-
pendent of all these unclean beasts! Do you
know, Mrs. Nan, that I have a crow to pluck
with you? Are you one of those ladies who
never look at your cards, or are you aware that
a poor old fellow came begging a cup of tea
from you one sultry afternoon, and was turned
broken-hearted from your door?"
“I was out," replies she, briefly, the old temp-
tation to stem the tide of his flummery coming
back strongly upon her. “I am so glad,”–
speaking rather stiffly—“that you are all up
this year, and gladder still about George's
Agency. I stupidly forgot to ask, when and
where it is."
“It is one of Lord —'s," replies the old
gentleman, his own voice stiffened by the per-
ception of the little appetite shown by Mrs. Nan
for his gallant reproaches.
“ Lord —!” repeats Anne, in a tone of sur-
prise.
The title is that of the owner of the country
house, at which Pamela and her present fiancé
had spent the delicious Sunday that had so po-
tently influenced their after-destiny.
“ Yes, Lord —; do you know him? He is

a very old crony of mine; we matriculated at
Christ Church together. If you meet him-
well,”-chuckling—“I can only hope he will
not tell tales out of school.”
“I have no acquaintance with him."
“I suppose,"—still chuckling—“that he ex-
pects to find George a chip of the old block.
He will not be long in finding out his mistake;
poor George!”
“Poor George!" echoes Mrs. Bligh in a
tone of such heart-felt compassion as at once pro-
cures her pardon for any previous omissions
from her old companion, who naturally thinks
that she is pitying his son for being so unlike
his brilliant sire.
“ He does not favour me much, as the serv.
ants say," continues George's parent, compla-
cently. “But he is a very good fellow in his
way; a very good fellow indeed! never given
me an hour's anxiety. I am afraid,”—with a
look and smile of self-congratulatory reminis-
cence—“ that my poor father would have had a
very different story to tell when I was his age.'
Mrs. Bligh's face does not reflect, even faint-
ly, her companion's simper. She has none of
her Plas Drow reasons for keeping him in good
humour, and sees plainly that the tide of his rem-

iniscences is bearing them both directly to the
well-known tale of the four-wheeler and the in-
jured husband.
“I think,” she says, with a gravely deter-
mined effort to kill two birds with one stone-
snub his father, and do George a tardy justice-
" that the more one knows of your son, the
more"
Her sentence stops short, like a broken
bridge in mid-air, for while it is still unfinished,
her eye, straying carelessly round merely to
avoid fixing itself on the grimacing old face be-
side her, sees by a stir near the door, and a
thickening of the little crowd in that direction,
that an arrival of more importance than any
that has yet taken place is happening. Out of
the clustering knot she presently sees emerge a
figure whose air of distinction, heightened in
this case by contrast, makes her recall with a
smile of indignant incredulity, his own joking
doubt as to his ever having had a grandfather.
He is shaking hands cordially with half-a-dozen
of the dingy men and women, when Czar, dis-
covering the cause of Anne's sudden inattention
to himself, cries-
"Why, bless me, here is our friend who
makes faces and busts; our poor Coke!”

It has always seemed to comfort Czar for
the inequality between the sculptor's social suc-
cess, and his own opinion of his merits, to repeat
frequently the flat old joke at his expense, and
prefix every mention of him by thé epithet,
“poor.” “Our poor Coke!”
To-night the epithet seems ludicrously inapt.
With his well-cut clothes, and his Malmaison
carnation, and his brilliant smile, he seems to
have as little relation as possible with Czar's de-
pressed and sordid adjective.
“Our poor Coke does not look very poor to-
night,” she says, drily, and at the same instant he
catches sight of her.
In a second, a sort of a cloud has come over
the radiance of his face, and he half turns as if
to move further off. Good Heavens! how she
must have given herself away, when he, the
least coxcombical of men is obviously afraid to
meet her—to see the havoc wrought in her by
the sight of his new bliss! She cannot, must
not leave him for an instant the prey of so hu-
miliating a delusion. Without the slightest com-
punction she quits Czar, and going up straight
to Coke, accosts him brusquely.
“I thought you never went to evening par-
ties.”

“The exception proves the rule;"_still with
that shade of embarrassment over his whole
per-
son. “He is a dear old friend of mine ; we were
in Paris together as penniless art students, and
lived in the Quartier des Étudiants, for sixty
francs a month each, and dined when we could
afford it at a jolly dingy restaurant, for eighteen
sous, pain à discrètion; afterwards our paths di-
verged—”
“As widely as Pharaoh's butler and baker,”
interrupts she, with what she feels to be an over-
done air of ease and good spirits. “You give
the cup into Pharaoh's hand at Marlborough
House, and he is hanged, or rather his pictures
are not. But,”—with a still more forced spright-
liness_“You will have to give up Bohemia now.
I do not quite see Pamela among these “bangs
and beads.''
He looks at her, not very comfortably.
“Yes,” he answers, gravely. “I shall have
to give up Bohemia.” And she could almost
fancy that there is a slight touch of regret in his
voice.
They have passed out of the studio into a
small adjoining room, where for the moment
they are alone.
“I suppose,” he says, with an almost shy

smile, “ that you are thinking that there is no
fool like an old fool !"
Now is her moment, and she rushes upon
it.
“On the contrary," she cries with precipi-
tate eagerness, lifting her moved lit face to
his, “I think that you would have been the
base Indian over again, if you had not snatched
at the fine pearl that Heaven threw in your
path."
“Rather that you threw in my path,” he an-
swers, in a tone of emotion, too poignant to be
wholly pleasurable. “ Dear, dear friend, do you
suppose that without your sweet encouragement
I should ever have dared to match my Novem-
ber afternoon with that exquisite April morn-
ing? You know, as well as I do, that it is all
your doing.”
She stoops her head in bitter acquiescence,
with this second testimony to her own gift for
suicide.
" It is a tremendous venture,” he goes on,
passing his hand through that hair, which
though thick and wavy, yet shows undeniably
the grey ensign of declining life. “If it an-
swers—if it answers,"—repeating the doubtful
phrase with an energy of anxiety that for the

moment makes him look old and worn—"the
credit of it will be all, all yours!”
On the next day Mrs. Bligh has the pleasing
task of imparting to the Mulholland family the
downfall of their revived hopes, which George
has-probably because he felt that their com-
miseration is more than he can bear-omitted
to do. Their laments are loud and long.
Why he is old enough to be her grand-
father,” cries Lucile indignantly—“there must
be forty years between them.”
“I cannot say much about that,” says Mrs.
Mulholland emphatically, “nobody has better
reason than I to know how absolutely unimpor-
tant a discrepancy in mere age is !”
“Then it was not a joke after all about his
coming all the way to Plas Drow to see her," is
Sue's contribution.
“We all thought he was your property, Nan,
did not we, girls?” from Mrs. Mulholland.
“I am sure that I never did or said any thing
to confirm so insane a delusion," replies “ Nan"
with an energy whose unnecessary bitterness
she feels the moment it is too late.
“I am so sorry that I made Jim and Fezy
shake hands with her!” almost sobs Sue.

“ Jim! Fezy!"_impressively taking hold of a
paw of each-"you are never, never to shake
hands with that lady again."
And then happily a hotel waiter enters and
announces the arrival of a “young lady" from
Russell and Allen, and a "young gentleman'
from Peter Jones, with their respective parcels,
and in the frenzied skurry of their London week
the subject of George's wrongs is happily shorn
of some of the gigantic proportions it would
have assumed in the quiet and leisure of Wales.
Mrs. Bligh does her duty thoroughly and
warmly by her country friends, lunching, tea-ing
and dining them, as often as she can prevail
upon their delicacy to husband the rapidly
dwindling legacy by sharing her roast mutton
and bread and butter. She chaperones the girls
untiringly to sights, and makes up Mrs. Mulhol-
land's endlessly vacillating mind for her at every
counter in London. She would always have
rendered them these services out of gratitude
and good will, but usually she would have
thought them a corvée--now she is thankful for
them; looking on the unbroken succession of
tiresome little calls upon her time and attention
as so many allies to keep thought at bay.
When the Mulhollands are gone, she throws

herself with passion into her good works. In a
moment of wild philanthropy she treats eleven
of the Poplar factory girls to an afternoon at
the Naval Exhibition ; but after some hours of
fervid heat and acute mental and bodily strain,
returns home late in the evening a good deal
crestfallen, with only seven of her protégées re-
maining; the other four having left her society
for that of as many soldiers from Chelsea Bar-
racks, whose appearance and manners pleased
them, and from under whose martial care they
mock her when she pursues them to the Cock-
pit of the “Victory” with kissed hands and

less to say, intrude herself upon their new bliss.
She has done them her good turn, and there is
for the present nothing for her to do but quietly
to efface herself from their orbit. She calls now
and then on Pamela to avoid any appearance of
coldness, but she usually chooses an hour at
which she is likely to be out, and with the
sculptor her intercourse is quite in abeyance.
Yet though she scarcely or ever comes

across this pair of lovers of her own making, the
consciousness that every hansom that flashes
past may show them to her enclosed within the
intimate precincts of its wooden flaps, that
every walk she takes with the dogs in Ken-
sington Gardens may reveal them pacing or sit-
ting in dual felicity beneath the summer trees,
keep her feverish. She is far too sound and
strong to fall ill, but she grows thin, and sleeps
brokenly. When it is once irrevocable, when
they are one flesh, she will-So she tells herself
-easily regain her equable spirits.
The marriage will certainly take place soon;
what is there for them to wait for? and once in
the list of accomplished facts, she has surely
sense and strength of character enough to ac-
cept it peaceably. But though she longs with
restless eagerness to learn the date of the intend-
ed union, from neither of the betrothed pair does
she hear a word of tidings concerning it. And
meanwhile, like Ritter Toggerburg,
“Ruhe kann sie nicht erjagen."
One morning after a more than usually un-
satisfactory night the question occurs to her,
why she should put herself to the needless pain
of this perpetual condition of dreading expecta-

tion? what there is to hinder her from going
away, out of reach of the possibility of meeting
those whom it is now her highest wisdom to
avoid ; and not returning until after they are
wedded man and wife. Why should not she
go abroad?
She had spent the first year of her widow-
hood on the Continent, so has gained the habit
of solitary travel. Why should not she revisit
those places where she had passed the first
stupefied months of her release from her eight
years' bondage, so that she may convince her.
self that, evil as her case now seems to herself,
it is yet conspicuously better than when her
stunned and dazed eyes had last rested on Le-
man's Lake or Chamouni's Glaciers.
The plan approves itself so instantly to her
mind that, within a fortnight of its first concep-
tion, she is making arrangements for the tempo-
rary devolvement of her philanthropical labours
upon a fellow-worker; has presented herself at
Mr. Cook's office ; is putting away her best
china, and, most difficult task of all, is planting
out the three dogs in homes where their frail-
ties will be leniently dealt with. She has writ-
ten to Pamela to inform her of her imminent
departure, and has had a somewhat painful and

unsatisfactory farewell visit from her; painful
from the girl's evident inability to conceal her
remorseful conviction of the cause of her
friend's oldened and altered looks, and prema-
ture departure, and unsatisfactory, because Pa-
mela tells her nothing of her future plans. Per-
haps, as Anne bitterly thinks, she supposes her
unable to bear the hearing of them.
The visit has taken place in the morning,
and in the late afternoon, when she has just
thrown herself, tired and heated with final pack-
ings and puttings away, into her arm-chair, an-
other caller is announced, whose name—thanks
to the dogs being already removed to their tem-
porary homes-she is actually able to catch.
“ Sir Robert Coke!” She has not seen him,
except in passing snatches, for over a month.
Is it her sick fancy, or does he, despite his grey
frockcoat and his Malmaison, look a degree or
two less radiant than he did at his old Quartier
Latin friend's shabby evening party? And if
he does, is she mean enough to be glad of it?
“ So you are going to leave us?” he says,
complying with her request to sit down, but
not choosing his once favourite low seat. “I
think you are about right. I mean”-in hasty
explanation—"that my dear London that I love

Quite alone?"
The tinge of almost caressing pity in his
voice goes near upsetting her.
“ There is nothing new in that; I have done
it before.”
And where are you going?”
“I do not know; I have no fixed plans. I
shall make and modify them as I go along."
“ You are perfectly right; that is the way to
enjoy oneself really.”
She is silent. The word “enjoy," though
she intends honestly to try and learn what it
means by-and-by, seems at present to have little
connection with her dreary solitary flight from
herself.
“And when ”-very, almost too kindly-
are we to welcome you back?”
She shakes her head.

taking the bull by the horns and smiling—"on
my return I shall find you Benedick the mar-

suppose so.”
“Since you have nothing to wait for, I con-
clude
you
will be married as soon as the season
is over?”
His last answer had come slowly and pen-
sively, but there is energy enough in his next.
“No, oh dear no! Quite impossible. I
must go to Karlsbad. I cannot risk a repeti-
tion of my wretched crippled state. I do not
want the poor child to start in life as a sick
nurse."
“ It will not be till autumn then?”
“ Autumn!”—he repeats slowly—“yes, that
will be the right season, grey hairs and falling
leaves
go
well together."
Something in his tone makes her uncomfort-

“She is an ideal sitter. So quick to catch
the exact pose I want, and so untiring in keep-

over again she must have been ready to drop
with fatigue; when I am in the heat of my work
I know how inconsiderate I am. But she has
never uttered a murmur."

“ The labour we delight in physics pain," re-
plies Anne, ashamed of herself for the bitterness
of her quotation; and yet with no more original
commentary rising to her lips.
" I suppose”-hesitatingly—“that you would
not have time to look in at the studio to-mor-
row and give your verdict ? "
She turns away her head quickly, with a
mixed feeling of sharp pain and self-congratula-
tion. After all, he must have very little idea
what “looking in at the studio" under these
altered circumstances mean to her, or he would
never have made the proposition.
“No, I think I will wait till—till I come back

He sighs.

again ?"

“ I am going to give it up; in my—my al-

a studio attached."
“Will not you be sorry to leave it?”
He seems to feel the stupidity of the ques-
tion almost as strongly as she does herself, the
moment it is uttered.
Sorry!”-he repeats with asperity, then

CHAPTER XVI.
Mrs. Bligh had never meant her foreign
trip to be a short one, but it prolongs itself
even beyond her original intention. She makes
her way to the Engadine, where, thanks to her
early start, she is ahead of the mob of tourists;
and when the greatest heats are over, drops
down into Italy for the vintage. From one
high-perched, sweet-named Italian town to an-
other she wanders, as the spirit, the guide-book,
or the advice of some chance-met or made ac-
quaintance impels her. The endless succession
of new scenes and objects inevitably divert her
attention from herself; and she is too intelli-
gent in mind, and too sound in body, not-
as the calming and healing weeks go by—to
draw from the old historic sites and older nat-
ural lovelinesses of the civilised world's pet and
darling, much of that enjoyment at whose very
name she had mocked at the time of her gloomy
setting off. She recovers her flesh and her
sleep, and here and there makes a pleasant
friend or two.

But from the thought of a return home her
soul for several months turns away with dread
and aversion. Return to her means an empty
little house, the neighbourhood of the friends
whom, despite her mental convalescence, she
still feels that it will be safer, and at the same
time most difficult to avoid ; means manufact.
ured interests and uncongenial work. Her com-
munications with England have been few and
slight. Her correspondents-never numerous
-have, from the very nature of her travels—
so entirely planless and guided by the impulse
of the moment-been baffled in their efforts to
keep in touch with her. She has had, indeed,
several letters from Mrs. Mulholland, conscien-
tiously covering every inch of very thin paper,
full of trifling family details, and running over
with alternate ecstasies and lamentations over
the beauty, commodity and ironical too-bigness
of George's new house. From Pamela she has
received a few short notes, each of which she
has laid down with a balked sense of how un-
satisfactory a scribe Miss Capell Smith has be-
Not one of her dull and superficial
billets gives an explanation of the fact that she

ural enough that her mentions of her betrothed
are so few and sketchy. He has gone to Karls-
bad. He has come back. They have been
looking at houses together. The latter fact,
out of regard, no doubt, to her friend's feel-
ings—in a rather indistinct postscript. Before
the end of November even these baffling scraps
of information have ceased to reach her; and
Pamela is altogether dumb. Mrs. Bligh ex-
plains this silence to herself in her own way.
The marriage-already delayed beyond her
expectations—has at length taken place. Pa-
mela is on her honeymoon. There is nothing
surprising in her letting that period pass with-
out making Anne a sharer in its joys, but the
latter feels a prick of pained annoyance that
the wedded pair should have thought it kinder
not to impart to her the date of their union.
It is true that she has seen no announcement
of the event in the English papers; but since
she has read them with no regularity she may
easily have missed the particular issue in which
it appeared.
It is not till the week before Christmas that
she sees again her native shores; to which she
returns with her mind about as dark as the
wintry weather around her concerning those

two of her country-people whose doings chiefly
interest her. She reaches home late and fagged,
after a through journey from Turin, and a sick
and stormy crossing. She goes to bed almost
at once, thankful to the bodily fatigue which
blunts the sense of dreariness of her unwel-
comed home-coming. It comes up with, and
overtakes her next morning, however, when she
wakes up to the consciousness of being boxed
in by a close and dirty darkness of ill-smelling
fog.
“What possessed me to come home?" she
ejaculates to herself, over her murky, gas-lit
breakfast ; to herself, since as yet she has not
even the dogs to make her moan to—“ home, in-
deed!” In the afternoon the filthy ebony veil
lifts a little, and she goes out shopping. It is
odious out of doors, but anything is better than
to sit at home, a prey to the vain and melan-
choly memories that, despite her changed and
braced condition of being, throng back upon
her in the depression of the heavy atmosphere,
where dirt has taken the place of light.
The shops are crowded to suffocation with
people buying Christmas presents. She can
scarcely make her way through the eager
throngs, or gain any hearing from the distracted

shopmen and women for her modest require-
ments. She is standing near the door of a
pretty shop in Oxford Street, waiting for the
chance of an opening, and making the reflection
which must occur over and over again to us
all-even though not like Mrs. Bligh, just re-
turned from the leisurely elbow-room of a hap-
pier and emptier clime—how hideously thick
we are upon the ground, when the sound of a
familiar voice, uplifted in the intense exaspera-
tion of a mild-tempered person whose patience
is at an end, salutes her ears.
May I ask ? ” inquires Mrs. Mulholland,
making a frenzied clutch at a heated shop-boy
who is hurrying past her, “is there any chance
of my ever being served ? I have been waiting
here five and thirty minutes, and as my time is
extremely limited-Nan!"
In the joyful surprise of catching sight of
her friend, Mrs. Mulholland lets the relieved
employé slip through her fingers, while she and
her daughters push their way with a vigour be-
fore which all impediments yield, to the spot
where Anne is standing.
Well, this is nice!”-kissing her warmly-
despite the publicity of the place—“ I had not
an idea you were back.”

“ I only arrived last night.”
Well, I suppose you have been seeing all
kinds of fine places. You will think us poor
stay-at-homes very humdrum."
“ How well she is looking !” cries Lucile.
“ I declare, Anne, that you have got a sort of
foreign cut about you."
“ Have I?”-grateful for and warmed by the
kindly looks of the three simple, affectionate
faces round her—yet a little embarrassed by
their unanimity of scrutiny; “ and you all? You
do not look as if much ailed you."
Oh, we are in great form, thank God!
You should see Czar. He is looking so ridicu-
lously young; you have only just missed him ;
we have had such difficulty in getting him out
of the shop; we wanted him out of the way be-
cause we have clubbed together to buy a really
good Christmas surprise for him.”
“We have been staying with George at his
new house,” says Sue, triumphantly getting her
oar in for the first time; “it is such a beautiful
house ; such lots of room in it. I daresay he
will ask you to stay with him. He can put us
all up, and all the dogs and both the donkeys
too.”
“ Indeed!" with a transient inward flash of

compassion for the lonely-hearted George,
mocked by the spacious emptiness of his abode.
“He is going to spend Christmas with us at
Plas Drow," says Lucile ; "we are all going
down together to-morrow; we mean to have
such fun in the train. George is going to pre-
tend to have mumps to keep people out of the
carriage."
This last piece of information inspires Mrs.
Bligh with a surprised doubt as to whether the
pity she has been lavishing upon Miss Capell
Smith's rejected lover is not a little superfluous.
“ It will be diagonally opposite to George's
last visit to us, when he moped so dreadfully,”
almost shouts Sue, in her joyful excitement.
“ Pamela is coming down with us too."
“ Pamela !” repeats Anne, in a tone of in-
tense surprise ; "then when is the wedding to
be?"
Her three hearers look at each other with a
puzzled air, then break into a simultaneous
laugh.
“ We do not say anything about that yet
awhile,” answers Mrs. Mulholland, nodding
sagely ; " of course, such an idea has never been
mooted by any one as yet. It would be scarce-
ly decent.”

was broken off ?”
“ Broken off ? Her engagement !” Anne can
get out nothing but these fragmentary repeti-
tions, and even they come gaspingly. “Do you
mean to say ”—she breaks off.
They are looking at her paled and quivering
face with a new light of astonished comprehen-
sion on their features.
“And do you mean to say that you do not
know-that you have not heard that it is broken
off ? ”
She shakes her head, incapable of speech,
uncertain whether she wakes or sleeps.
“We thought, of course, that she had told
you."

ly; I was moving about; but”-her senses com-

and as yet, almost unrealisable event-“ please

plies Mrs. Mulholland, still surveying with a
rather astonished air the extraordinary change
in her friend's complexion—“ did you, Luce ?
I think it was a case of mutual consent. For
my part I always thought it a silly sort of affair;
even if there had been no George in the case, I
should have said just the same. I never could
understand what she saw in him—no, girls, do
not talk nonsense; it had nothing to say to his
age. No doubt he is a very good sculptor, and,
from what you told us of him, he is certainly a
very expensive one; but when it comes to mar-
rying—"
It seems to Anne as if she should never be
able to disentangle herself from the questions,
the comments, the endearments of her compan-
ions in order to carry out a plan, which she is
passionately anxious to put in action without a
moment's delay. When, at length--it costs her
conscience a wading knee-deep in lies to effect it

into the first hansom without a glance either at

But this contretemps is spared her; Miss Ca-
pell Smith is at home, and as her parents are
neither very intimate with, nor very congenial
to Mrs. Bligh, the latter has no scruple in hav-
ing herself shown directly up to the daughter
of the house's high-perched sitting-room. Pa-
mela is stretched in a wicker chair before a
very good fire, with a book in her hand, which,
on the visitor's entrance, is ruthlessly tumbled
on the floor, while the hand and arm that sup-
ported it are with its fellow flung round Anne's
neck.

lier and adoring one; but Mrs. Bligh pushes
her restored worshipper gently but decidedly
away, looking piercingly at her the while. The
girl's beaming eyes drop a little.
“1-I see that you have heard! Are you-
are you very angry with me?”
Perhaps it is only Anne's guilty fancy that
there is a slight but mirthful tremble at the cor-
ners of Pamela's mouth as she puts the depre-
cating question.

"Have you thrown him over?” she asks
sternly.
The lovely culprit's eyes still droop; for a
moment she hesitates, then breaks into an un-
controllable fit of laughter.
“Do not kill me for laughing!" she says in-
distinctly. “ But if you only knew—there is
such a ludicrous contrast between your tragic
face and the facts of the case I threw him
over! Yes, I threw him over; but, oh, how
thankful he was to be thrown!"
“ What?”
“ He was far too chivalrous ever to have
done it himself ; but oh, he was obliged to
me !"
Anne is silent, staring at her young compan-
ion with a feeling of stupefaction, behind and
through which some enormous muffled joy
seems to be stirring.
“Let us talk comfortably,” says Pamela, put-
ting her softly into the wicker chair, and lying
down on the rug at her feet. “You really need
not look at me like a tigress robbed of her
whelps; I am a great benefactress to him ; ask

not."

any comment. Only her eyes, into which the
light of a great yet doubting joy is coming, ask
for further explanation of this bewildering
riddle.

her silky rust-coloured head against her friend's

we went over five mansions in Belgravia, and
three in South Kensington from basement to
attic, and on the morning after the eighth I sent
for him and told him that I thought we should

You should have seen his

again. Then turning round so as to place her
elbow on Anne's knees, and lift the dewy rosy
gaiety of her face towards hers. “You dear

electric bell. His beautiful grey frock coat is
exchanged for a wintry tweed, suited to the
austerity of the season; and he has no Malmai-
son; but there is not a touch of winter in his
look, as he draws the pouf—she remembers how
he had eschewed it on his last visit to her feet
and says, with a long, low sigh of content,
“Dear little friend, how pleasant it is to be here
again!”
