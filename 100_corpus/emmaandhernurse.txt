The mind of childhood has very aptly been likened
to a slate, on -which the pencil of the parent or teacher
may write whatever lessons of good or evil his judg-
ment or his error may dictate. If such is the fact—
and the most ordinary experience teaches us, that
'As the twig is bent, the tree's inclined'—
how serious and important a duty of us all is it, to take
strict care that the soft, impressible mind of youth
should receive no images but those of moral beauty
and religious excellence!
Perhaps no system has effected more good, in an
educational point of view, than the Eeligious and
Moral Stories which have been published of late years
for the youth of both sexes—tales in which Eeligion
is made the handmaid of Morality, and, without being

injudiciously put too forward, is used with judgment as
the guiding influence, and a happy state of piety made
the reward of moral trials and worldly misfortunes.
In this light, Mrs. Cameron's highly popular Tales of
'Emma and her Nurse,' and' The Mother's Grave,'
are good examples; as showing that, in whatever
sphere our lot may be cast, or whatever duties we may
be called upon to perform, a conscientious reliance on
God, and an honest discharge of our obligations, will
eventually carry us through the roughest troubles to
the haven of peace, self-approval, and Divine reward.
The sale of successive editions, amounting to nearly
Seventy Thousand copies, of these favourite Tales, and
the continued demand for them, has induced the Pub-
lishers to issue this copyright illustrated edition.

CHAPTER L
Near the pleasant town of Montgomery there is a very
ancient house, standing amidst gardens and woods,
which belonged once to a noble family. Many years
ago, the owners of this house, not having occasion for
it, let it for a season to a gentleman of great fortune;
who, as he was travelling through the town, was struck
with the beauty of the situation.
This gentleman was a baronet, and was called Sir
Arthur Harewood. He was a very handsome man, and
exceedingly accomplished and agreeable in his manners.
He furnished the house which he took in the most
sumptuous manner, and kept many fine carriages and
horses, and numerous servants: so that the gentlemen
in the neighbourhood courted his acquaintance very
much, and many would have been glad to have had

him for a husband to one of their daughters. Among
these, a gentleman of an ancient family, whom he
frequently met with in his hunting-parties, took an
early opportunity of introducing him to his wife and
daughter, who lived in great retirement. The extra-
ordinary beauty of the young lady soon attracted Sir
Arthur's attention; and after seeing her a few times
only, he asked her hand in marriage, and almost as
quickly obtained it. Sir Arthur neither knew nor
valued the many excellences which this lady pos-
sessed; for she had been brought up by her mother
in habits of the strictest piety, and she answered
all the hopes which her excellent parent had formed
respecting her.
Immediately after her marriage, Lady Harewood
was taken to the hall, where every thing which this
world could give was provided for her; and she hoped
that in her husband, whose agreeable manners and
endeavours to please had rendered him very dear to
her, she should find the piety, the wisdom, and the
tenderness which had till this time formed the great
sources of her happiness in her mother.
Lady Harewood was at first pleased with every
thing she saw; and when, by degrees, the character

of her husband opened upon her, and she found that
he was only a man of the world, she pleased herself
with the delightful hope that she should be the
means of leading him to better things. Many delightful
, plans of reformation she formed in her household,
when her husband should be brought to think as
she did. She ventured, by degrees, to talk to him on
her favourite subjects; but sometimes he laughed at
her, and sometimes made no answer.
Lady Harewood hoped that she made some im-
pression on his mind; yet she could not help
observing that his manner became cold towards her,
and that he left her frequently.
One evening, when she had been talking to him with
more than common earnestness on the subject of
religion, he turned t'o her suddenly, and, in a very
stern voice, he said: 'Lady Harewood, I have heard
enough, and too much, on these subjects. I married
you for jour beauty, your simplicity, and your gentle-
ness; but I little expected to have had the peace of
my life invaded by your enthusiasm and gloom. I
wanted a companion to add to my happiness, not a
gloomy foreboder of future ill.' So saying, he burst
from her, and she did not see him again for many hours.

Lady Harewood spent those hours in her closet;
and when Sir Arthur returned, she received him with
smiles, which shone amidst her tears as the sun
brightens the dewdrops on the April flowers.
The sweet silence of subjection which graces the
Christian wife, and the gentle readiness to oblige, of
one more ready to forgive than to remember wrong,
was not unobserved by Sir Arthur. He could not
help loving and admiring Lady Harewood in spite of
himself; and she spent the rest of the evening in con-
versing with him upon some improvements he was
making in his grounds, and upon a journey he was
going to take to see his Yorkshire estates.
A few days afterwards, Sir Arthur set out upon his
journey.
As Lady Harewood was expecting soon to be
blessed with a little child, she could not help ex-
pressing to Sir Arthur her wish that he would return
as soon as possible. He promised in a kind manner
that he would, and then took his leave of her.

CHAPTEE II.
When Sir Arthur was gone, and Lady Harewood was
alone, she did not give way to melancholy, but she
amused herself in her leisure hours with visiting a
charity school which she had established. She had
chosen for the mistress a very pious woman, and the
scholars were the children of the labouring poor in
and about the town of Montgomery. She visited the
school every day, and her greatest pleasure was to
explain the Bible to these little ones. She also visited
the parents of the children when they were sick, or
in want of such things as she could supply them
with.
A few weeks after Sir Arthur had left her, her little
girl was born. Though Sir Arthur had delayed his
return much longer than Lady Harewood had hoped,
yet he did return when he heard of the birth of his
child: he expressed, however, some disappointment

when he found it was a girl, and took but little notice
of it.
He remained a few weeks at Montgomery, and then
took his lady, and their little girl, whom they had
named Emma, to London with him.
The winter was spent in London, and in spring they
returned to Montgomery.
Everybody remarked that Lady Harewood looked
ill, and it was whispered by the servants that the
behaviour of Sir Arthur occasioned her much anxiety;
it was even suspected that' he preferred other ladies to
her: yet she made no complaints, and studied his
happiness in every thing; she rode with him, and
walked with him, and shared as far as she could in all
his pursuits.
In a few months after their return into the country,
he again left her; he returned, indeed, for a short
time, but it was only to leave her again: and thus
passed the time till their little girl was a year and
a half old. During this time Lady Harewood had lost
both her parents almost suddenly, which, together
with the increasing unkindness of Sir Arthur, had but
too plainly impaired her health, yet she did not
complain. ,

When Sir Arthur was at home, she devoted her
time to him; she consulted his pleasure in every thing,
and never murmured at his neglect.
When he was away, she found some amusement in
airings in the lovely neighbourhood of Montgomery,
* in her organ and books, which were the furniture
of her dressing-room, but chiefly in the company of
her little girl, and in visiting her school, and the many
poor persons who were dependent on her kindness.
But her highest pleasure at all times was in visiting
the house of God, or in her daily retirement to her
closet. There, with her Bible or on her knees, she
tasted that peace which the world cannot give; there
she received those supplies of strength which enabled
her to bear sickness with patience, neglect with meek-
ness—to be strong in weakness, and to look beyond
this world of sorrow to the region of eternal day.
The time was now approaching when Lady Hare-
wood was expecting a second baby; and Sir Arthur,
who had been spending a little time at home, was
preparing for another journey. His carriage was ready,
and he came into her dressing-room to take his leave
of her. She was not there; and while he waited her
return, he employed himself in looking round the

room. Her organ, her child's playthings scattered on
the carpet, her work-basket filled with garments for
the poor, the rational and interesting books which
filled her book-case—all these things brought her
various innocent and useful pursuits before him. Her
closet door was open; he went in. A Bible lay
on her table; her tears had wet one part of a leaf;
it was in this verse: 'Wives, be in subjection to
your own husbands; that if any obey not the word,
they also may without the word be won by the conver-
sation of the wives' (1 Pet. iii. 1). On her cushion a
book lay open in the prayer of a wife for her husband:
he felt fretted with himself, and tried to be angry with
her; just then he heard the outer door of her dressing-
room open, and he returned into it hastily.
Lady Harewood was there, all sweet smiles, and her
little lisping girl held her gown.
Her smiles did not hide the paleness of her cheeks.
For a few minutes Sir Arthur felt as if he could not
leave her: he looked at her, and sighed. But other
thoughts came into his mind: he took the child in his
arms, and talked to it till he felt a little composed,
and then hastily bade Lady Harewood farewell.
She would have asked him again not to delay his

return, but she could not. She followed him to the
door, and there they parted: and with her Sir Arthur
forsook his prospects of happiness. He refused to
listen to his conscience; he forsook domestic joy and
duty, in search of forbidden pleasures, and he left Lady
Harewood never to see her more.

CHAPTER III.
After the departure of Sir Arthur, Lady Harewood
spent her time, as usual during his absence, in great
retirement; and seldom went beyond her shrubbery
and park, except to her school and her poor people,
and the ancient church of Montgomery.
One day when she visited her school, she called
the schoolmistress aside, and told her that she wished
her to choose from among her scholars a girl who
might be able to take care of her little Emma. 'If
it please God,' she&said,' to give me another baby, I
shall put it into the hands of the nurse who has
hitherto taken care of Emma: and now my little
girl begins to talk, and will soon be able to understand
what is said to her, I am very anxious to provide a
person to be about her, who willvteach her to know
and love God, as soon as she learns to know and
value the things which He has created.'
The schoolmistress replied, that she could recom-

mend several of her scholars, and called three of the
eldest into the room where they were sitting.
Lady Harewood soon made choice in her own mind
of a gentle, thoughtful-looking girl, neat and modest in
her dress and manner: and when the girls were sent
back into the school, she said to the schoolmistress,
'I have chosen little Jane; for I have often noticed
the humility of her behaviour, and the attention with
which she has always listened to my instructions. Her
mother, too, I know, is a pious woman, and has borne
as a Christian many sad reverses of fortune.'
Lady Harewood then gave the schoolmistress some
money, which she desired her to lay out in suitable
clothes for her, and begged her to prepare her for her
service against the time when she might send for
her, which would probably be in the course of a few
weeks.
'I do not think it right,' said Lady Harewood, while
she was talking to the schoolmistress, 'to part with
any servant who may be agreeable to Sir Arthur; but
I wish to choose all I may take into my family in
future, because they are the servants of my God.'
When Lady Harewood was gone, the schoolmistress
told Jane that she was to be the servant of her little

lady. It is not very easy to say how glad she was;
and she longed for the time when Lady Harewood's
little baby should be born, and she should undertake
her new situation. In the meantime her mother
and schoolmistress took great pains to prepare her
for it.

CHAPTEE IV.
One fine morning, Jane was awakened by the pleasant
bells of Montgomery ringing merrily. She jumped up
in haste; and before she was dressed, one of the
neighbours ran into the house, and said 'Lady Hare-
wood has a son born; and Sir Arthur has been sent
for.'
There was joy all over the town; and Jane rejoiced
in the hope that she should soon be summoned to her
new place. She made haste to get all her little business
finished. That same evening, as she and her mother
were sitting at the door of their house, she saw the
worthy vicar pass not far from the house, and turn into
the fields which lead towards the hall. In about an
hour he returned. Jane's mother thought he looked
unusually grave; but Jane was too full of joy to notice
his appearance. She was listening to th'e bells, and
thinking how happy she should be very soon.

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
Many persons were seen that evening going to and
fro, as if in haste. But Jane's house lay out of the
way, and none of the neighbours happened to call upon
them; and, indeed, being always employed, they were
not much in the habit of knowing what was going on.
Towards dusk, as Jane was closing the shutters on
the outside of the house, she said 'Do, pray, mother,
step out for a minute, and listen to the bells, before we
shut them out with these doors and window-shutters.'
Her mother came out, and listened to the bells, as
they rang merrily from the town.
'How pretty they sound, mother!' said Jane.
'Perhaps, before this time to-morrow, I may be at the
hall.'
'Well, my love,' answered her mother; 'and I hope
it will be for your good: but you must not expect too
much happiness from going there.'
'Surely, mother, it will be very delightful to wait on
Lady Harewood and that sweet baby: all that I mind
is, leaving you.'
'My dear,' answered her mother, 'I do not wish to
make you unhappy; but I wish you to learn, as early
in life as can be, not to depend too much upon any
thing which this uncertain world offers to us.'

the bells just as they had begun to ring.'
'That is very odd,' answered her mother.


## p. 16 (#26) ##############################################

MEMOIRS OP EMMA
The pleasant sound of the bells soon stopped, and
their confused echo from the hill and castle above was
all that broke the silence for a few minutes; when the
dull sound of the heavy muffled passing-bell slowly
awoke the ear of Jane to sad attention.
'Oh, mother, mother, what is that ?' said Jane.
Before Jane's mother made any answer—for, indeed,
she had no answer to make —a confused sound of voices
was heard coming towards them; and the neighbour
who had brought them the news in the morning came
running first.
'Have you heard the news, Jane %' said she,
as she led the girl into the house; 'Lady Harewood
is dead, and all your schemes are at an end. Her
fine lady of a nurse will never let you come into the
nursery.'
'Lady Harewood dead!' repeated Jane and her
mother at once; 'Lady Harewood dead!'
'That is no surprise to me,' answered the woman.
'Everybody knew she was in a consumption for weeks
past. Sir Arthur has broken her heart'
'And is her pretty baby alive?' said Jane.
'Yes,' replied she ; he is a stout, healthy little fellow,
and likely to do very well.'


## p. 17 (#27) ##############################################

AND HER NURSE.
17
The woman did not stay long with Jane and her
mother; for she wanted to tell the news to her other
neighbours.
Poor Jane's schemes of happiness had passed away
like the beauty of a full-blown rose, whose delicate and
ripened leaves are scattered in every direction by the
sudden force of a summer storm.
The news soon spread through the town, and every
face looked sad; for all who knew Lady Harewood
loved her.
The next morning the clergyman sent for Jane's
mother, and gave her some information concerning
the death of Lady Harewood. He told her, that a few
hours' before it took place, she had sent for him; that
she had begged him to pray with her, and that she
had expressed a deep sense of her unworthiness; but a
lively hope, through the merits of our Saviour, of
entering into that glorious world where sin and sorrow
could no more follow her. She charged him with her
tenderest love and duty to Sir Arthur, and her prayers
for his temporal and eternal good. She gave her
blessing to her dear children; and she sent a petition
to Sir Arthur, that Jane might still be allowed to wait
upon her little girl.
c


## p. 18 (#28) ##############################################

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
Having said these things, her soul seemed already
to enter into its rest. She seemed, even before her
departure, to be leaning on the bosom of her Lord.
A short time afterwards, she was released from her
earthly prison, and went to see Him face to face.
The clergyman concluded this account by advising
the woman not to mention to her daughter the like-
lihood of her being sent for to the hall.
The next day Sir Arthur arrived at Montgomery,
in the deepest affliction, accusing himself bitterly for
having deferred his return home so long.
The following week everything was prepared for
Lady Harewood's funeral.
The muffled bell began to toll very early in the
morning. As the burying-place of Sir Arthur's family
was at a very considerable distance, Lady Harewood
had requested that her body might be laid beside that
of her parents, in a small parish church about two
miles from Montgomery.
Jane, with several of her young companions, went
up the hill, and sat themselves down among the ruins
of the castle, in order to have a full view of the long
procession; for from this place they could see, at in-
tervals, all the road from the hall to the parish church.


## p. 19 (#29) ##############################################

AND HEE NURSE.
19
About eleven o'clock the procession set off, and it
reached nearly a quarter of a mile. The hearse was
covered with nodding plumes, the carriages were hung
with black cloth, aud many of the horsemen wore
black cloaks. Women and children followed the
funeral on foot.
'Oh, what a dismal sight!' said one of Jane's com-
panions. Jane made no answer for some time.
As she sat on the sweet-smelling thyme which nearly
covers the hill, and the sun (for it was a fine day)
shone upon her, she called to mind that there was
another world, far above the blue sky to which she
was looking up. It is a world where there is no
winter and no storm, and whose inhabitants have
entered into their rest.
'The gentle spring, which but salutes us here,
Inhabits there, and courts them all the year.'
She remembered how Lady Harewood had talked to
her and her school-fellows about heaven and Jesus
Christ. 'And, surely,' she said to herself, 'she must
have loved heavenly things, or she would not have
left the pleasures and gaieties of the hall to talk to
poor children like us about them.'

So she answered: 'It is a dismal sight to those who
have 'used that sweet lady ill; but it is very pleasant
to think that she did not value the fine things of the
world while she lived in it, any more than her poor
body does now the fine procession that follows it.
She was poor in spirit, though she had money and fine
clothes: so she has been carried by the angels to rest
in Abraham's bosom.'
Though Jane loved to think of her lady's happiness,"
yet she felt very sad when she thought that she should
never see her again in this world; and all that day,
and many days afterwards, she did little else but
cry

CHAPTER V.
The Monday following Lady Harewood's funeral, Sir
Arthur's housekeeper sent a message to Jane's
mother, to desire her to make her daughter ready,
and bring her in three days' to the hall.
- Jane was comforted at the idea of going to the hall;
but her mother did not think of it with the pleasure
she had done before. Jane had lost a friend, a guide,
and a protector in Lady Harewood, of which, her
mother feared, she might often stand in need. Yet,
after all that had happened, she thought it was right
that her daughter should undertake the situation her
lady had appointed her; and, giving her her best
advice and earnest prayers, she now led her out, as it
were alone, into a wide and wicked world.
On the morning fixed, she and Jane set out for the
hall; but very different were the feelings of Jane
respecting her new situation to what they had been a

22
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
few days ago. She had been taught the vanity and
emptiness of the world, and the immense importance
of everlasting things, by a lesson that she could never
forget. The sorrow she had felt had led her to look
into her own heart, and she found with shame that she
had been indulging a sinful love for the things of
the world. She saw her own sin and corruption, and
her dependence was now upon the Lord her righteous-
ness.
When Jane and her mother arrived at the hall, they
were led through a long passage, opening into different
offices, into a small wainscoted parlour.
The bright oak boards were covered in the middle
of the room by a floor-cloth. Over the chimney-piece
was a large picture of a gentleman on horseback, with
a whip in his hand. Near the fire, by a round table,
peeling almonds, sat the housekeeper. She was a
short, elderly person', old-fashioned in her dress and
appearance, and not very pleasing in her manner and
voice.
Jane and her mother stood at the door, and
courtseyed low.
'Good-morning,' said she to them. 'So, I suppose,
you are the persons Sir Arthur sent for: he had a

AND HER NURSE,
23
great desire to comply with his lady's wish ; and I hope
he may not have cause to repent of it.'
'I hope not,' answered Jane's mother. 'My
daughter will do every thing in her power to give
satisfaction.'
'Well, I daresay; but it is no concern of mine: she
is not to be about me. I suppose your daughter has
not been used to gentlefolks.'
'Madam,' answered the woman, 'she has been very
little out of her father's house, except to her honoured
lady's school; but she will endeavour to learn such
behaviour as is suited to her situation.'
'Well, the nurse will see about that: she must go up
into the nursery; but I had only a few words to say to
you first. Sir Arthur is going soon to London, and he
intends to take his little boy with him, for he is very
proud of him ; and Miss. Emma will stay in the country:
and then, if your daughter continue about her, she
will be under my care, and I shall expect that she will
attend to my orders.'
'Certainly, madam,' answered the mother.
'Well,.that is all I had to say to the girl; so you
may go upstairs now. But you don't know the way.'
Then she arose from her seat, and walked to the

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
passage door. 'Oh! here, as luck will have it, is
the under-nurse. Clara, here is Miss Emma's new
maid: please to show her upstairs.'
'Which, madam?' answered Clara, looking first at
Jane and then at her mother, from head to foot.
'Why, the girl, to be sure,' answered the house-
keeper.
'Please to come upstairs, then,' said Clara.
Jane's mother thought that she must not follow her
daughter upstairs; so she took her leave of her, and
bid her be a good girl.
'Good-bye, mother,' said Jane, with a heavy heart.
Clara took Jane up a narrow staircase, which led into
a wide gallery, opening at one end upon a handsome
staircase, and at the other was a large window. On
each side of the gallery were many doors. Clara
opened one of these into a small room, with a bed of
crimson stuff in it, and another smaller bed by it.
'Here you are to sleep, and your young lady too, I
suppose,' said Clara; 'but follow me into the nursery.'
She opened then another door within, and led Jane into
a large room, where the upper-nurse, with the two
children, was sitting.
Jane courtseyed low.


## p. 25 (#35) ##############################################

AND HER NURSE. 25
The nurse looked (in Jane's eyes) like a very fine
lady. She did not even speak to Jane, or take any
notice of her courtesy. On her lap lay a delicate little
baby half asleep; and at her feet, upon a cushion, sat
the pretty little Emma, a fair and lovely child, not two
years old. Her head was covered with flaxen curls;
and her pretty blue eyes, and sweet smiling face, brought
back to Jane the remembrance of Lady Harewood.
These poor babies each wore a sash and rose of black
crape, but they did not know that they had lost a kind
and tender parent.
'What a while you have been away!' said the
nurse to Clara. 'Here this little girl has been crying
to be nursed. She has been so used to be nursed
by her mother, that she would always be upon one's
lap.'
Clara took the little girl in her arms, and Jane noticed
two tears still standing on her rosy cheeks. 'Oh,' she
said to herself, 'how I shall love that child!'
Jane stood nearly a quarter of an hour before the
nurse spoke to her, or asked her to sit down.
'So,' she said to her at last, 'you are the girl that
my lady took such a fancy to! She had more whims
than any lady of her rank I ever met with.'

'Can you work?' said the nurse again.
'Yes, ma'am,' replied Jane.
'Give her the child's frock to finish,' said the nurse
to Clara.
Jane sat down quietly to her sewing, and the nurses
soon afterwards took the children a-walking. In about
an hour's time they returned with the children asleep.
They laid them down: and then, standing over the fire,
they employed themselves in talking about some young
men they had met with in their walk; till at last, a
bell ringing, the upper-nurse bade Clara in haste go
down and see if dinner was ready; and then fetching
out of the drawer an infant's cap, she sat down to plait
it, meanwhile asking Jane many questions about differ-
ent people in the town, especially the young men, and
those who were reckoned the most gay. 'Keally,' said
she at last, after asking Jane a great many questions,'I
never saw such a stupid girl in my life: one would
think you had lived with your eyes shut. Why, Clara,
who has not been in this country a quarter of a year,
knows more, by a great deal, of the young men in the
town than you do.'
'Keally,' answered Jane, 'I thought that was no
concern of mine.'

AND HER NUESE.

The nurse made no answer, but began to hum part
of a song tune.
Clara soon afterwards came up and laid the cloth,
and they all sat down to dinner. The nurse then cut-
ting up the wing of a chicken, bade Jane keep it warm
till Miss Emma awoke. When dinner was over, the
nurse said she wanted to speak to the housekeeper, and
she was going down stairs; but desired Clara and
Jane not to stir from the room till she came back.
'So,' said Clara, when she was gone, 'here is this
fine London lady that my master's sister sent down to
nurse Miss Emma gone down into the housekeeper's
room, as she says; and she will come back by and by
with almonds and raisins: but nobody supposes that
she is sitting all this time with the old, cross, fat lady.
-* Did you ever see our butler?'
'Yes,' answered Jane.
'Well, do not you think he is very smart and
genteel? and his pantry is close to the housekeeper's
room.'
Jane took no notice of this speech, and they were
both silent.
'Dear me,' said Clara again, as she was sweeping
the hearth and putting the chairs in their places,

'how you sit sewing there: I wonder you are not
tired.'
'Oh dear!' answered Jane, 'I have done nothing
to tire me yet: people that are to get their bread must
not talk of being tired.'
Clara shrugged up her shoulders.
At last Jane said, 'How long these pretty little
creatures sleep!'
'The longer the better,' answered Clara; 'little
Emma is so cross.'
'Poor little thing!' answered Jane; 'perhaps she
misses her mother.'
'Do you love children?' asked Clara.
6 Oh, very much!' said Jane.
'So do I,' answered Clara; 'but they are often very
troublesome.'
'I must go down,' said she again a few minutes
afterwards, 'and get the linen from the laundry-maid.
Will you watch the children the while?'
'To be sure I will,' answered Jane; 'but you will
not stay long; because if-they should wake I should
not know what to do, as I am not yet acquainted with
them; and the nurse begged us both to stay.'
'Oh, never mind her,' answered Clara: 'she dare

not tell of me.' So down Clara went and left Jane
with the two children.

Jane had been left alone nearly half an hour; and
as she sat at work she began to fear that she had got

among people that did not know the fear of God.
Then she heard the little one moving, and she got
up and laid down her work, and went to look at
him; but he had settled again to sleep. She stood
for some minutes listening to his soft breathing, and
then she went to the bed where his sister slept;
her eyes were shut, and her cheeks rested on her
little rosy hand; her flaxen curls peeped from below
her cap.
'Dear little creature!' said Jane to herself: 'your
mother is gone, and there is no one left to teach you
to know your God and your Saviour. Oh, my
Saviour!' added she, kneeling down by the bedside,
'give me grace to teach this dear little child the
knowledge of Thee. May I, as far as possible, supply
to her the place of that dear parent she has lost; and
oh! preserve my weak and sinful heart from the
snares and temptations which surround me.'
Just as she had finished these words the little Emma
opened her eyes. She looked round, and seeing only
a stranger, she raised her pretty upper lip, and was
beginning to cry; which Jane, perceiving, she took her
in her arms, and gently kissing her, 'Come, pretty
baby,' said she, 'you shall have your dinner.'


## p. 31 (#41) ##############################################

31
When the child had eaten her chicken, and drank
some water out of a silver cup, she began to feel quite
awake, and seemed desirous to run about. Jane put
her down, and took up her work, that the little one
might trot about, and feel herself at liberty. For some
time she avoided Jane; but finding that she did not
meddle with her, but left her to herself, she ventured
by degrees to come nearer to her; and at last she pro-
ceeded so far as to look at the flowers upon her gown,
and in a little while she permitted her gently to lift her
upon her lap, and to begin a discourse with her, and
play at bo-peep behind her pinafore. The tender
kindness of Jane towards her, something like her
mother's behaviour, no doubt pleased the little babe,
though she had not sense to know that she had lost or t
that she had gained a friend. From that time the
friendship of Jane and Emma daily increased, till it
almost ripened into a parent's love for a child, and into
the love of a child for a tender parent.
In her care and attention to this babe Jane found
her great happiness; for it was indeed true, that her
companions were persons who did not five in the fear
of God. The nurse was entirely unprincipled, though
she had the art at present to conceal, in a great degree,


## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################

32
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
the sin of her conduct. Clara was thoughtless and
ignorant; and though not ill-natured, she thought only
of amusing herself. She never considered that she had
any duty to perform in the state of life to which it had
pleased God to call her; but, like too many other
persons, her only object was to pass the day in doing
as many things as she could that she liked, and doing
as few that she disliked.
We have seen before that Sir Arthur was not very fond
of little Emma. The nurse soon made this discovery,
and though during Lady Harewood's lifetime she had
pretended great fondness for the child, she did not now
think it necessary to do so; and as she found that the
child was much quieter and more contented with Jane
than with anybody else, she left her entirely to her
management, both by night and by day. And Clara,
who never cared how little trouble she had, was
equally ready to do the same. So that Jane found
constant and delightful employment with her dear little
mistress.
Some of her pleasantest hours were spent in
taking her a-walking in the park and gardens, when
the weather would allow, for it was now winter. Here
she would gather for her all the winter flowers that

had escaped the frost—nosegays of gplden rod, and
winter daisy, and laurustinus; and she would call the

little one to listen to the voices of the winter fowl,
- and to peep at the deer and the hares in their forms of

fern, almost hid among the low brushwood in the
park.
As the nurse and Clara liked sitting by the nursery
fire better than walking out, if the air was frosty, they
would seldom stay out long, unless they met with any
of their acquaintance working in the gardens or
walking out with their guns, and then they would stay
out a great while; so Jane, finding this to be the case,
generally managed to take Emma out by herself.
After her walk the little girl became sleepy, and
Jane laid her down to rest in her own room; and then
she would always sit and work by her, though the
nurse and Clara often wanted her to leave her and to
sit in the nursery with them: but Jane would not quit
her little charge; and she found, too, that at such
times she might employ her thoughts in a most
profitable manner.
Surrounded as she was by temptations and bad
companions, she wanted continual support from the
source of all strength; and as she sat by herself, she
could lift up her heart in prayer for strength and
wisdom to support and guide her in this new and
difficult situation. She could call to mind the instruc-
tions that had been given her at church or school, or

by her mother; or she could meditate on such parts of
the Bible as she had learned by heart as a child, and
draw from them their sweetness, their wisdom, and
their comfort, for her own circumstances, as the little
skilful bee sucks the food he wants from the flowers of
the field.

CHAPTER VI.
At last the time arrived when Sir Arthur was to go to
London. The winter-had passed away, and the early
spring was returned. The nurse and Clara employed
themselves in preparing every thing for their long-
talked-of journey: they were veiy much pleased with
the thoughts of it, and hoped that it would be a long
while before they should return into the country.
'I declare, Jane,' said the nurse one day, 'I would
not have staid this winter here, if it had not been for
the thoughts of going to London; and since you have
been here it has been ten times worse. You are so.
moping, it makes me ready to hang myself to look at
you: you are always reading your Bible, or singing
psalms, or sewing your fingers to the bone. I would
not spend another winter with you here for all my
lady's jewels; besides, since my lady died, I have never
dared to go up the best staircaise, after it is dark, by
myself.'


## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################

AND HER ISTJRSE.
37
At last the day came for the family to begin their
journey, and this day was Sunday. Jane returned from
church just as Sir Arthur rung his bell, and ordered
his little daughter to be brought to him.
Jane carried her into the library, where Sir Arthur
was arranging some papers before he set out. He took
the little girl on his knee, kissed her, and seemed
affected by her pretty, playful way, for she stroked his
cheek with her hand, and called him papa, and laughed
and chuckled; and when he returned her to Jane, he
gave her half-a-guinea, and he bade her be careful of
the child: then, hastily collecting his papers together,
he rang the bell violently, and ordered his carriage to
the door. Jane stood behind one of the pillars in the
hall, with Emma in her arms, that she might see her
papa go.
Sir Arthur stepped into his chaise with his servant,
and drove off.
'Where is my little lady?' called out the nurse,
running into the hall, as soon as Sir Arthur was gone;
'I must have a kiss of her.'
So Jane took the child into the servants' hall, at the
door of which the old family coach was standing. All
the servants were collected, taking their leave of their

companions. The butler, the cook, the two nurses, and
one housemaid, were all setting out. The nurse was in
high spirits, talking very loud; she took little Emma
in her arms and kissed her, and gave her to Clara, who
kissed her too. Meanwhile Jane pressed in her arms
her dear little smiling brother; she then returned the
baby to its nurse, and took little Emma back again,
and stood at the door watching the party getting into
the coach. They were all in high spirits, laughing
and talking loud ; the coach-door was shut, and they
drove off.
Jane stood for some minutes at the door with little
Emma, who was watching the horses, till the house-
keeper called her, and bade her come to dinner, or she
would not be ready for evening-service.
The dinner was prepared in the housekeeper's room;
and here, with the housekeeper, and the old house-
steward, and her dear little mistress—who was now
able to feed herself—she sat down.
'You must use yourself, Jane,' said the housekeeper,
in rather a cross voice,' to my quiet habits and regular
hours, or you and I shall never do together. I shall
have none of your old nursery doings going on here.'
When dinner was over, the housekeeper seemed in

AND HER NURSE.
39
better humour; so she said to Jane, 'If you like to go
to church, I will take care of your little girl.' Then she
reached from a cupboard a pot of sweetmeats, with
which she feasted the child; while the house-steward
slept by the fire in a three-cornered chair; and Jane
was permitted to go to church.
After this day, however, the housekeeper was often
very cross with Jane. She always seemed suspicious of
her, and dissatisfied with everything she did; and when-
ever she walked out, she fancied that she was going to
meet somebody; and she was always accusing her of
thoughtlessness and levity.
Jane became very unhappy; and if it had not been
for the sake of her dear little mistress, she would have
begged her mother to take her home. However, she
determined to acquaint her with her distress; and for
this purpose she asked leave one evening to go and see
her; and the housekeeper promised to take care of the
child during her absence.
When Jane got home, she related to her mother, as
soon as she was alone with her, all the history of her
present trials. And indeed, she had much to tell; for
though she had often seen her mother since she had
left home, yet she had not often been alone with her;

40
MEMOIKS OF EMMA
and besides, she knew that her mother would not give
encouragement to her telling little stories out of her
master's family. However, she determined now to
conceal nothing from her.
When she had finished the account of all that had
happened to her since she had left home, her mother
said to her in reply, 'My dear Jane, you may feel at
present dull, but be sure that the persons you are now
with are much better companions for you than any you
have had before; and though the housekeeper may now
be cross, yet, if you behave with prudence and civility,
she will see that you are not like the nursemaids she
has been used to, and she will treat you, by and by,
with kindness. Your young lady has also been put in
your hands by her dear mother, who is gone to heaven;
and though she is yet but an infant, you may begin to
teach her a little of her duty. Kemember where it is
said "He that keepeth the least of God's command-
ments, and teacheth another the same, shall be called
great in the kingdom of heaven." Perhaps it may
please God to bless your instructions to this baby; and
when she grows up, she may be, like her dear mother,
a light shining in a dark place. Oh! it is a very
honourable employment to nurse a little child for God.

AND HER NURSE.
41
Above all, my dear Jane, beware of your own weak-
ness, and the wickedness of your heart, and remember
to pray often in the day for God's help.'
Jane listened with great attention to the advice her
mother gave her, and she returned to the hall more
cheerful and happy.

CHAPTEE VII.
The very next morning, when Jane was taking her
morning walk with the little Emma in the shrubbery,
she bade the child look up to the blue sky; and she
said to her, that God lived above it. She then told her
that God had made her, and that He gave her her
breakfast, and her dinner, and her supper, and her
clothes, and everything she had.
Though she repeated this several times, the little girl
did not understand it; and she got tired of listening,
before she knew the meaning of what Jane was telling
her. So Jane left off talking to her, and showed her
the fawns in the park.
The next time, however, that Jane talked upon these
subjects with her, she seemed more pleased; and at last
quite understood what she said, and would repeat it all -
to Jane herself.
Jane then proceeded to teach her something more
about the love of God to little children, always trying


## p. 43 (#53) ##############################################

AND HER NURSE.
43
to tell her everything in as pleasant a way as she could;
and when she was attentive, she would reward her with
some roses and sweet-smelling flowers to put in her
little garden basket, or she would give her a few early
strawberries. Sometimes she would teach her a verse
in the Bible, by making her repeat it after her from
time to time. She would also endeavour by degrees,
to lead the little one to a knowledge of her own evil
heart.
One day Emma was very naughty, and would not
obey an order which Jane had given her; and she went
into a passion, and cried violently. While Emma was
■»in the passion, Jane put her into a corner of the room,
and told her that she would not look at her. But when
Emma was good she took her out, and kissed her; and
then lifting on her lap the little thing, whose bosom
still heaved with sobs in spite of her smiles, she tried,
as far as it was possible, to make her know that her
'heart was naughty, which had made her go into such a
passion. She then told her that when she went into
passions it was displeasing to God, and she made her
kneel down and ask His forgiveness. What further
lessons she gave to her little girl we shall learn, as
Emma did, by degrees. Jane was also very desirous


## p. 44 (#54) ##############################################

44
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
that Emma should learn to know something about her
mamma. ,
There was a large and beautiful full-length likeness
taken of Lady Harewood just before her marriage.
This was hung upon the great staircase, and there it
might still, within a very few years, have been seen;
and though the colour was much faded, it still kept its
singular sweetness of countenance.
Almost every day Jane took the little girl to look at
this picture; and she told her it was the picture of her
mamma, till the little girl quite knew it, and called it
mamma. Then Jane would point up, and tell the little
one that her dear mamma was living beyond the sky,
in a very fair and lovely country, with the good God
who hadmade her; and that, if Emma was a good little
girl, she would go some time or other to see her mamma.
By degrees, but not till she had been with her many
months, she led her to some little knowledge of her
Saviour.
One day Emma told a lie; upon which occasion Jane
informed her that there was a very dreadful place called
hell, where liars are sent when they die: she told her
that it was full of fire and brimstone, and that people
who once go there never can come out.


## p. 45 (#55) ##############################################

45
Emma seemed frightened, and began to cry: and
Jane made use of this circumstance to teach her some-
thing about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; that
He was the Son of God, and had been nailed by naughty
people upon a cross, that she might not go to hell for
the wicked he she had told; and that she must love
Him, and do whatever He ordered her to do.
All this little Emma did not understand at first; but
by its being repeated in a very pleasant way at differ-
ent times, she gained at length a clearer knowledge of
these things than can be supposed by any one who has
not taken delight to sow in a baby's heart the seeds
of celestial plants; for it is a soil well suited to their
growth, and perhaps the Heavenly Gardener peculiarly
blesses them with His favour.
I must now mention that what Jane's mother had
expected in time took place. The housekeeper be-
came in a few months quite reconciled to Jane:
she found that she was very orderly, industrious,
and quiet in her behaviour; that she was always
engaged in the care of her little mistress; that she
paid attention to the neatness of her dress and the
civility of her behaviour; and that, though she did
not indulge her, yet that she treated her with respect,


## p. 46 (#56) ##############################################

46
MEMOIRS OP EMMA
and not with that vulgar familiarity which we some-
times see used by nurses to the children they take care
of; she always called her Miss Emma, and made her
sit above her at table. The little one was also
exceedingly fond of Jane, though she never ventured
to disobey her. The housekeeper, finding this to be
the case, treated Jane with a great deal more kindness
than she had done at first. Sometimes she would talk
very freely to her. She had seen a great deal of the
world in her younger days, and had known many of
Sir Arthur's relations who had lived and died at his
Yorkshire mansion; and she would tell Jane many a
long story about lords and ladies long ago dead, as
they sat working together by the fire in an evening.
Sometimes she asked Jane to read a chapter in the
Bible, or sing a psalm, and would make many inquiries
about the things which she had learned from her lady
at school. Jane was pleased to find that the house-
keeper seemed to take increasing pleasure in these
things: and the house-steward also would listen to the
Bible when Jane read it; and sometimes, when she had
finished reading, he would take up the Bible himself, a
thing which the housekeeper said she had never seen
him do before.

47
Thus did Jane's life become far less unpleasant than
it had been at first, though at times she could hardly

help wishing for her mother's comfortable fireside;
for still the housekeeper was at times very cross, and

could not be pleased, and did not choose Jane to read;
then the old house-steward went to sleep, and Jane
heard nothing but his snoring, and the wind complaining
through the crevices of the old-fashioned doors. Then
she would remember how often her mother had told
her that we are not to look for happiness from anything
which this world can give.
The pleasantest time Jane spent was in walking out
with her little mistress. Sometimes she was allowed
to go beyond the park, accompanied by an old foot-
man, who had very little else to do than to assist in
carrying his young lady. Then Jane would take her
little mistress to the castle hill, and show her the
distant mountains, the towns, and villages rising amidst
sweet woodland scenery ; and here the little one would
play among the ruins in the beds of thyme. Some-
times Jane would show her the little church where
her mother's remains were at rest. Jane seldom
gathered any very sweet flowers for her, or showed
her any fine views, but she would try to lead her mind
to contemplate her great Creator, who' has made all
these lovely objects to lead us to Himself.

CHAPTER VIII.
From time to time it was reported that the family were
coming back, but again and again Sir Arthur delayed
his return; for since his lady's death he never had
liked Montgomery, nor could he visit his home without
very painful feelings of remorse. From London he
went into Yorkshire, where he spent the summer and
autumn, and returned in the winter again to London.
At the close of the winter he was expected at Mont-
gomery; but his little boy was unwell, and he took
him to spend the summer by the sea-side, and then
another winter was spent in London. But during all
this time he was continually sending word that he
should soon be at home. Many letters were received
from the servants who were with him, and it was
generally supposed that he spent his time in great
gaiety, and that he had quite forgotten Lady Hare-
wood.

Two years and a half had now passed away since
Jane had entered into Sir Arthur's family. The little
Emma had reached the age of four years, and there
was not in the neighbourhood a more lovely child.
She was very like her mother in person, and had her
sweet expression of countenance. The pains which
Jane had taken with her had been blessed by her
heavenly Father; the seeds of piety which had been
sown in her heart were already budding and blossom-
ing, and promised to produce good fruit.
It was very pretty to see her, when she felt tempted
to be passionate or disobedient, go quietly by herself,
and kneel down, and joining her little hands, pray
God to make her heart clean and white; and then
she would rise from her knees all gentleness and
obedience.
Jane had taught her to read; and at that early age
she could read many easy chapters in the Bible; and
when she was tired of reading, she would ask Jane to
tell her stories out of the Bible. She could say many
verses and hymns by heart. She loved to hear Jane
tell her about the love of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, in dying for sinful children, and of that happy
place where all holy children shall go when they die;

51
and she would talk about her mamma, and ask Jane if
she should see her when she died.
Jane taught her to be good-natured and civil to
everybody; so that she was the delight of the house;
and on her account everybody also loved Jane. She
also took her to church on Sunday; and here her
behaviour was admired by everybody; for, young as
she was, she had learned to reverence the house of
God.
Jane daily prayed God to bless her in her care of
this child, and she daily thanked Him for having thus
prospered her care. Every day she became more and
more happy in her little girl; and she herself was so
much beloved by all the family for her attention to
the child, so unusual at her age, that her situation
was become exceedingly comfortable. She was now
anxiously looking forward to the return of Sir Arthur,
thinking that he could not now fail of being pleased
with his little girl, when a letter arrived for the house-
steward, informing him that Sir Arthur would be down
in a few days, previous to his going abroad. Jane's
heart beat high with expectation! On the day Sir
Arthur was expected, little Emma was dressed with
more than usual care, and she was placed on a seat

near the window in her own room to watch for her
papa. Presently a carriage was seen driving up; it
was attended only by one footman, yet it must be Sir
Arthur.
'Papa, papa is come!' said little Emma. 'Oh take
me down to see him!'
'Presently, we shall be sent for,' answered Jane, as
eager for the minute as the child.
In a short time a servant came upstairs and said,
'You must come down, Jane; but I wonder what's the
matter now! Sir Arthur is not come! there is only
the upper-nurse, and she is shut up with the house-
keeper; and when she bade me tell you to come down,
I thought the poor old lady was in tears, and she was
reading a letter.'
'Is not papa come?' cried Emma.
'We will go and hear all about it,' said Jane, as she
went down in haste.
When she got into the housekeeper's room, the
nurse hardly spoke to her, but ran to kiss little Emma,
and took her on her lap, as if she was quite overjoyed
to see her.
'Sit down, Jane,' said the housekeeper. 'I want to
talk to you a little.' But it was some minutes before

53
she could speak; at last she said, 'This is quite a blow
upon us, Jane!'
'I hope nothing is the matter!' said Jane, who was
frightened by the housekeeper's manner.
'Sir Arthur is not coming down, as he talked of,'
answered the housekeeper. 'He is going beyond the
sea directly, and he has sent for our dear young lady.
And—and—but you had better read the letter your-
self.'
Jane took the letter in haste: it was from Sir
Arthur; it was almost entirely filled with directions
about business till the very end, when he desired that
his little daughter might be sent to him by the nurse,
and gave orders that Jane should have her wages paid,
and return home.
Jane almost fell off her chair when she read this
letter: she turned pale and trembled, and at last burst
into a violent %\ of '"crying.. '■>'"•'/- '• •/
'Does anything hurt you, Jane?' said Emma,
jumping off the nurse's^Mp^iihd'rnmthig to her. 'Let
me kiss you, and make you well.'
Jane held the little one close to her, and bending
over her, cried more and more violently.

the housekeeper: 'anybody who knows the care Jane

cannot but feel very sorry for her. I think Sir Arthur
should have come and judged for himself, after all I
had told him of the girl's behaviour.'
'Dear me,' said the nurse quickly, 'surely Sir
Arthur is to do as he pleases; besides, I should think
Clara and me are quite enough to wait upon these two
children, now they can both walk. However, it's all
as Sir Arthur pleases; I have nothing to do but to
obey orders.'
'I wish you never did anything else,' answered the
housekeeper sharply.
The nurse took no notice of this; but, tying the
string of her cloak, and pulling on her gloves, as if
in haste, she said,' I wish Jane would get things ready;
I was to set out directly. I am sure I am very sorry
for the girl, and-,1 dare say she has done very well for
the child, considering she "is Only a charity-girl; but,
to be sure, she/wquld- find il'.another thing from this
country place when she gets to London among ladies
and gentlemen.'
'Come, Jane,' said the housekeeper, getting up and
going to her, for she was very sorry for her, 'do not

BS
take it so to heart; I will write to Sir Arthur about you.
But we must obey his orders now; you must collect
your young lady's clothes together, and get her ready.'
'Just a few clothes,' said the nurse,' till something
new can be got for her; for I dare say she has none
but old things, and the make is quite dowdy,' added
she, looking at Emma from top to bottom.
Jane got up from her seat, crying and sobbing, and
the housekeeper, calling one of the housemaids, bade
her go up with Jane and assist her.
The poor girl cried all the time she was packing up
the child's clothes, and the housemaid cried too; but
it was still worse when she began to get the little girl
ready. When she put on her cloak and bonnet, the
little girl jumped about, and said, ' Oh, I am so glad I
am going to see papa! now I will go and get your hat,
Jane, and your warm shawl.'
Jane began to weep and sob afresh; and taking the
child in her arms, 'Oh, my baby, my Emma!' she
cried, ' what shall I do without you?'
'Come,' said the housemaid,' if you are to part, the
sooner the better.' So taking Emma's box under her
arm, she led Jane down again into the housekeeper's
room.

'Here you are,' said the nurse, rising in haste. 'We
have no time to lose. Come, my little darling, will
you go with me to see papa?'
'I will go with Jane,' answered the child.
'But Jane is not going,' replied the nurse, holding
out her arms; 'but come to me, and I will buy you
some new frocks, and sashes, and dolls, and playthings.'
'I will go with Jane,' repeated the child, putting
her arms round her neck, and holding her as tight as
she could.
The child seemed frightened by the nurse's manner,
and by seeing Jane cry. So the housekeeper took her
gently from Jane; and bidding the nurse go on and
get into the carriage, she followed her into the hall,
and then lifted the little one into the carriage, still
struggling to get away, and calling to Jane to come
too; but the carriage-door was shut, and the horses
drove off. And when Jane, who had followed the
housekeeper to the door, could see the carriage no
more, she sat down upon a bench in the hall, and
leaning her face against the wall, she cried for some
time, as if her heart would break.

CHAPTEE IX.
The servants collected round Jane to comfort her, for
all were very sorry for her. Some blamed Sir Arthur,
and others said it was all the fault of the nurse, whom
they called a wicked woman.
Meantime the housekeeper sent for Jane's mother,
and as soon as she arrived, she took her into her
room, and told her what had happened.
The good woman was not surprised. She had lived
long enough in the world to know that it is full of
changes and chances, and she had walked long enough
in God's ways to know that all things are ordered for
our good, however painful they may seem at the time;
so she did not feel so much cast down as many persons
would have done, to find that her daughter had lost a
good place, and that, most likely, by the ill-nature of a
fellow-servant. She thanked the housekeeper for the
kind manner in which she spoke of her daughter,

and said that, as it was Sir Arthur's will, she would
take her home, and do the best she could for her.
The housekeeper added, 'Your daughter has been a
good girl ever since she has been in this house, and I
shall write to Sir Arthur about her. And I beg you
will not send her to service anywhere, at least at
present; for I am sure her poor little lady will never
do so well with any one else. I wish Sir Arthur may
not find that she has changed much, for the worse. I
have a great deal of work, such as spinning, and linen
to make, which I put out in the town; and I may as
well keep your daughter at work as any other person,
for she is a clean, tidy girl, and I am very sorry for her.'
The good woman again thanked the housekeeper
with tears, and then went to look for her daughter; for
she thought it best to take her home with her that very
evening. She could hardly pacify her enough to get
her to put her clothes together in her box, which one
of the men promised to bring down to her house. She
then led her to the housekeeper, to take her leave of
her. She could hardly speak for sobs and tears, much
less thank her for her kindness to her, which her
mother tried to do for her.
'Poor girl!' said the housekeeper, 'I wish her

well, and shall be glad to see her at any time, if she
will step up. I never thought, when she first came,
that I should have liked her so well.'
All the servants followed Jane to the great gates,
and some of them cried at parting with her.
Jane cried all the way home; and all that evening
she scarcely spoke, but to lament her lost child. It
was much the same the next day, and the day after
that; and little did Jane do at her needle or anything
else.
The following day was Sunday. Jane was late at
breakfast, and cried almost all the time. When it was
over, her mother said,' Come, Jane, be quick and dress
yourself ready for church, for I want to have a little
talk with you.'
Jane obeyed; and when she came down stairs again,
her mother was ready in her cloak and bonnet.
'Come,' said she, ' your father and sister will finish
up the few little jobs that are to be done; and we have
a good hour before the bells will begin to chime. So
you and I will just walk up to your favourite hill by
the old castle.'
So they set off, but neither of them spoke till they
reached the top of the hill.

'The sun shines warm upon this bed of thyme below
the ruin,' said the mother; 'and here we shall have a
pleasant view of the church, and of Corndon, and we
shall hear the first bell that strikes up. So let us sit
down and rest ourselves awhile.'
She sat down, and Jane sat by her side.
'My child.' said the good woman, 'when shall you
put these sighs and tears away? do you think they will
bring your little lady back?'
'Oh, mother,' answered Jane, 'if you had known
that dear child, as I did, you would not wonder to see
me grieve: and then to think, too, that she is with that
naughty woman, who will take no care of her, nor teach
her anything good!'
'I am afraid,' answered the mother, 'that you are
a froward child.'
'How so, mother?'
'You will not be content to do what your Father
bids you, cheerfully; you will only do just what you
please. When He said, "Nurse the baby for me," you
replied, "I will do it willingly;" but when He said,
"Give it to me for a season," you answered, "I cannot
part with it."'
'Oh, mother, this is not giving the child to God!'

AND HER NURSE.
61
'Yes, my child; it is by God's permission that all
this has happened. When things are so ordered in the
way of His providence that any particular thing must
be done, then you may say it is by God's will, for He
permits it to be done; and it is your duty to submit,
and be contented.'
'Oh, mother, how can I feel contented when my
child is with a naughty woman who will teach it no
good?'
'It is God who has taken her from you; and though
she may be surrounded with wicked people, yet He can
hide her from all evil in the hollow of His hand.
Nothing is too hard for Him who can " take up the isles
as a very little thing;" and God gives you leave to pray
that He will protect her, and watch over her, and keep
her from evil; and, no doubt, God will hear your
prayer, and will cause this trial to work for the good of
the dear baby, in some way you do not know of. Will
you remember this, Jane?'
'I will try to do so, mother.'
'But this is not all: you must not only submit to
God's will, but you must try to find out what there is
in you which require this punishment. Perhaps you
wanted something to remind you that this world is

not your place of rest: you were getting proud, and
wanted to be made humble. You are going to God's
house; and when you are there, my dear Jane, pray
to God to make you submit to His will cheerfully.
Pray to Him also to send His Spirit into your heart,
to help you to search and examine it, that you may
know what secret iniquity there is in it, that you may
repent of it, and be forgiven for His sake who loved
you and died for you. Bear your little one on your
heart before God, and pray that she may be one of
those little ones who follow the Lamb whithersoever
he goeth. Pray that all things may work together for
your good; and then return cheerfully to do your
duty in this state of trial to which it has pleased God
to call you; and you will find that, though in the
world you may have tribulation, yet in Christ you
shall have peace.'
Jane listened to her mother, though she said but little
herself; till the bells beginning to ring for service,
they went down the hill, and calling at the house for the
rest of the family, they all went together to church.
Jane thought much of what her mother had said to
her, and she prayed very earnestly in God's house for
His grace to enable her to search out her heart, and

63
show her what evil there was in it; and she prayed
earnestly, too, for her dear child. She was very silent

and thoughtful all that day; but the next morning she
went to her business more cheerfully.

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
A few days afterwards, when she happened to be
quite alone in the house with her mother, and they
were sitting sewing together, Jane said, 'Oh, dear
mother! that was the best advice I ever had which
you gave me last Sunday as we sat on the castle hill.'
'I am glad you found it so, my child,' answered the
mother; 'and I hope you are more contented in your
mind.' *
'Yes, I am now, mother; but I was not so at first.
I did, however, as you bade me, and I prayed very
earnestly for the Holy Spirit to show me what evil
there was in me; and I tried to think over my be-
haviour for some time past, and to compare it with
those first twelve verses of the fifth chapter of St.
Matthew, which you have often told me to examine
myself by; and it came into my mind, in a little time,
that I had been giving way to a very proud spirit
about my dear young lady, and that I had been over-
much pleased with myself, when the servants praised
me for being careful of her, and that I had often
thought myself very wise and clever, instead of really
thanking God from my heart for making my dear
child what she was. And I found, too, that I had
been expecting too much from this world, and had

AND HER 5URSE.
65
been looking forwards to Sir Arthur's return, thinking
that he would praise me for my care of the child, and
that perhaps I should be taken to London or some
other fine place. And many other bad and foolish
things I found in my heart. Yet I did not know that
all these things were in my heart at the time.'
'The heart is very deceitful and wicked,' answered
the mother; 'yes, it is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked: who can know it?' (Jer. xvii. 9).
'Young people have no idea of the evil that dwells in
them, till different circumstances that happen to them
bring it to light; and perhaps the oldest among us,
who have watched over their hearts most, know but
little of the evil of our natures, compared with what
we shall know at that time when the secrets of all
hearts shall be made manifest. It must be the great
business of our lives, my dear Jane, to get new and
clean hearts; and we pray at church to be renewed
daily, though we cannot hope to be made quite free
from sin till we are restored fully, both in body and
soul, to the image of our Saviour. In the meantime,
my dear Jane, we ought patiently and thankfully to
receive every affliction that is sent to us, because
troubles are the great means which God uses to make
¥

us humble and holy, and to cast out sinful tempers
and desires.'
'I see it is so, mother,' answered Jane,'and I hope
I shall, by God's grace, bear my trial better than I did
at first.'
'Eemember where it is said, my dear Jane, "Count
it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; for the
trying of your faith worketh patience."'
'And I think,' answered Jane,' I can trust my dear
little lady more to the hands of God than I did before
you talked to me; He can take care of her and keep
her from harm, though I am not with her.'
After this discourse Jane became much more
cheerful. She set herself to help her mother in any-
thing she had to do ; and her time was also pretty well
employed with the work the housekeeper gave her.
From time to time she called upon the housekeeper,
but generally when she had work to take home.
The old lady always received her with kindness.
She told her that she had written to Sir Arthur about
her, but that he had taken no notice of what she had
said. However, she begged her not to give up all
hope. In answer to her inquiries, Jane heard that Sir
Arthur and his little ones were gone abroad; from

67
thence letters were received, sometimes from the
servants and sometimes from Sir Arthur. Pretty good
accounts were generally sent of the children's health.
Once or twice it was mentioned, in a letter from the
servants, that Sir Arthur was very gay indeed, and was
always engaged in parties of pleasure. At another
time it was said that he had had a very severe illness.
Word was frequently sent that the family were
returning; however, this had happened so often that
very little notice was taken of the report.
Jane could hardly ever visit the hall, or see any of
the rooms or walks, where she used to be with her
little girl, without feeling very sad; but it was a
comfort to bear this little one on her heart before God,
and she generally enjoyed the sweet confidence that He
would never leave or forsake her. The blessing of
God had caused Jane's trials to be exceedingly
profitable, so that she could say with the royal Psalmist,
'It is good for me to be afflicted.' She gained an
increasing knowledge of the evil of her own heart, and
consequently she learned, at the same time, to lay aside
every high opinion of her own goodness, and to lean,
in humble faith, on the righteousness of our Kedeemer;
and she learned to dread every thought, every look,
r 2

and every word which can lead weak and erring
creatures from the paths of holiness into the forbidden
paths of sin. And with this increase of inward purity
and humility in the heart of Jane, there was an
accompanying improvement in gentleness, kindness,
civility, industry, and a sweet, calm cheerfulness to be
observed in her outward behaviour. All this Jane's
mother noticed, and fervently thanked the Author of
all good.

CHAPTER X.
Two years had now passed away since the separation
of Jane and Emma, when early one morning, as Jane
was unbarring the shutters of the house, a little girl
came towards her from the pathway leading to the
hall, and she brought a message from the housekeeper,
desiring that she would come down to the hall directly.
Jane ran up to tell her mother, who bade her get
herself ready, and set out immediately. So Jane made
haste, and she was at the hall and at the door of the
housekeeper's room as the church clock struck seven.
The housekeeper came to the door to meet her.
'Well, Jane,' said she in a brisk and cheerful manner,
'I have got some work for you to do, which you may
as well set about directly.'
'Very, well, madam,' answered Jane, courtseying.
'Come, then, you must follow me upstairs into one
of the bed-rooms, and I can set you about it better
there.'


## p. 70 (#80) ##############################################

70
MEMOIES OF EMMA
So she went upstairs, and Jane followed her. When
they got into the long gallery, Jane looked towards the
door of the room where she used to sleep, and sighed.
The housekeeper opened the door of that very room:
the window-shutters were closed; but there was light
enough to perceive the crimson bed, the curtains of
which were drawn round it. 'Gently push aside those
bed-curtains,' said the housekeeper, 'while I open the
window-shutters, and you will see what you have got
to do.'
As Jane lifted up one curtain she thought she heard
a faint sound of breathing; but as the light gradually
burst from the opening window-shutter, glowing through
the crimson curtain, it brought to view the head of a
sleeping child resting on the pillow. A few flaxen
curls escaped from below its cap, and fell on its glowing
cheek; the other cheek rested on a round dimpled
hand; it was a baby's face that Jane knew and loved.
She looked, but scarcely believed her eyes. She looked
again: she did not dare to give way to her feelings
aloud; she fell on her trembhng knees, hiding her face
in the bed-clothes.
The housekeeper stood by, silently enjoying the
scene; and after allowing Jane a little time to indulge

AND HER NURSE.
71
her feelings, part of which time she spent in thanking
God for His goodness, she said, 'Well, Jane, what do
you think of the work I have found you? it is to be
yours, if you like it.'
'Oh, my dear kind madam!' answered Jane, 'this is
like a dream. But how did all this happen? when did
my sweet young lady arrive?'
The housekeeper then proceeded to inform Jane that
Sir Arthur had unexpectedly arrived the night before,
with only his valet, an elderly female servant, and the
little Emma. He informed the housekeeper that the
child had not been well, and. that she had expressed a
great desire to go back to the hall, and to her old nurse;
and that, therefore, he had thought it right to comply
with her wish, as the housekeeper had spoken so highly
of Jane's attention to her; and he therefore wished her
to be sent for immediately, and the child to be put
entirely under her care.
The housekeeper added that the valet had told her
, further, that the little Emma had scarcely ever seemed
gay or happy since she had left Montgomery; that the
nurse had never treated her with kindness, and seemed
to feel a strong though concealed dislike of her, because
she talked so much of Jane.


## p. 72 (#82) ##############################################

72
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
After they had travelled about in many countries, a
very little time before the return of Sir Arthur, this
abandoned woman forsook both the children, and went
away with a very wicked gentleman who had been
visiting Sir Arthur, and nobody knew what was since
become of her.
The children were then both left with Clara, who
was more good-natured to Emma than the nurse had
been, but who still was very negligent and thoughtless.
She had brought both the children to England: but
owing to her neglect, Emma had caught a severe cold;
and nobody attending to her, and the poor thing feeling
ill, she seemed to pine more than ever after Jane, and
became more and more unhappy. Sir Arthur had
therefore determined to take her back to Montgomery.
The little boy he had left in London with Clara.
The valet also informed the housekeeper, that Sir
Arthur, in the midst of a party of pleasure, had been
attacked with a violent illness, from which he had never
quite recovered. He added also, that his spirits were
exceedingly low, but that he tried to amuse himself by
new schemes of diversion. This, however, the house-
keeper desired Jane not to repeat, as it was told her in
confidence.


## p. 73 (#83) ##############################################

AND HER NUKSE. 13
Jafte was much grieved to hear of the shocking
behaviour of the nurse, but was not surprised, as it
very much agreed with all her general conduct; and
she considered it as an awful warning to avoid the love
of idleness and self-indulgence.
The housekeeper had just finished this account, when
a little rustling was heard in Emma's bed; so she left
Jane, and went down stairs. Jane went softly to the
dear child's bed, and opened the curtain. The little
creature was waking. She opened her eyes, and fixed
them on Jane, and then closed them again, as
if disposed to sleep. Again she opened them, and
looked with more earnestness on Jane. At last she
raised herself up in her bed, as if to be quite sure of
what she saw; and then, being satisfied that the person
she saw was indeed Jane, she held out her little arms
towards her, and as Jane stooped down to her, she
threw them round her neck, and kissed her cheek again
and again. 'Oh, do not let Emma go away from you
any more!' said the child; 'I will stay with you
always, oh, my dear Jane!'
But I find that I cannot describe this meeting as I
ought to do; I must be content with saying, that both
the baby and the nurse were so happy to see each


## p. 74 (#84) ##############################################

74

other again, that for some time they could think of
nothing else.
At last Jane remembered that it was getting late, so
she began to dress her young lady.. This she had
scarcely done when the breakfast-bell rung; and Sir
Arthur sent for Emma to breakfast with him, as he had
no other companion.
'When Jane took Emma into the breakfast-room, Sir
Arthur spoke civilly to her, and asked after her
mother. Jane was surprised to observe how much Sir
Arthur was altered in his appearance: he looked pale,
and thin, and sallow, his features were much lengthened,
and he had the appearance of being worn with fatigue
or sickness, and seemed also much out of spirits.
While Emma was with her papa, Jane busied herself
in arranging everything in the old apartments for the
comfort of her young lady; and she liktewise got leave
from the housekeeper just to run home and inform her
mother of what had happened.
Jane did not need to be reminded by her mother,
after all the lessons she had received, that in this world
we must rejoice with trembling; and she very soon
found, when she saw more of her little mistress, that
there was much cause of alarm about her health. The

75
child seemed feeble and easily fatigued, her appetite
delicate, her cheeks often flushed, and she had fre-
quently a cough: there was an appearance, too, of
thoughtfulness and a love of quiet about her rarely
seen in a healthy child.
From the account Jane had received from the house-
keeper, and from things which the child unintention-
ally said (for she did not seem desirous of complaining),
it appeared that she had been very unkindly treated.
But to this, perhaps, it was in a great measure owing,
that at her early age she had always kept Jane in
remembrance, and the things which she had taught
her, and had not laid aside many of those little habits
of secret prayer and reading to which she had been
used. Her heavenly Father had indeed hidden her in
'the hollow of his hand;' for He had. so blessed
Jane's instructions, and the early trials of her infant
days, that she possessed not only some outward habits
of religion, but she had a mind so heavenly, and a
temper so tender and humble, that, though an infant
in outward appearance, she could hardly be called a
babe in grace.
When Jane witnessed these things, she could not
help calling to mind, with tears, her own sinful mur-


## p. 76 (#86) ##############################################

76
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
murings at Emma's removal, and exclaiming with
triumph,'Thy ways, 0 Lord, are not like our ways,
and thy thoughts are far beyond ours.'
Yet, while Jane discovered that the outward trials of
the little one had turned out for the prosperity of her
better part, she considered it her duty to pay every
attention to the recovery of her bodily health. She
observed every varying symptom with anxious care;
and when she perceived that change of air and place,
with all her watchful attentions, seemed to make no
important change in the health of the little one, she
told Sir Arthur all that she had observed, and a phy-
sician was immediately sent for.
After examining his little patient, the physician gave
it as his opinion, that the child was suffering from the
effects of a long-neglected cold, and he expressed his
fears that it had fallen upon her lungs. As the winter
was now coming on, he ordered that she should be
confined entirely to the house, and watched with the
tenderest care.
Sir Arthur received this account of her health with
surprise and concern. Jane was in some measure pre-
pared for the report; and she felt that such was the
experience she had lately received of the tender mercies

77
of her heavenly Father, that she could commit the little
one calmly into Hie hands, whether for life or death—
determined to pay the most assiduous care to the health
and comfort of her mortal part, and to the advance-
ment of her better interests; that whether it was
the will of her heavenly Father that the babe should
remain a while longer here, or be quickly removed to
an inheritance above, she might be prepared to do her
Master's will wherever He might see fit to call her.

CHAPTEE XI.
In this manner the winter passed away. Prom time to
time Sir Arthur talked of returning to his house in
London, where he had left his little boy; but Emma
would often earnestly beg him not to leave her; and
he seeming now painfully reminded of his desertion
of her mother in her illness, was strongly alive to
the entreaties of his child. Disappointment and vexa-
tion had softened his heart, and prepared it for the
reception of better things; and disease, which was
gaining ground upon him, had deadened him to earthly
enjoyments.
One day, as he was carrying his little Emma down
stairs, after he had been talking to her about his in-
tended plan of going to London, she stopped him, as
they passed on the staircase, before the picture of her
mother, which Jane had often shown to her. 'Look!
dear papa,' said the child, pointing with her finger;
'there is mamma: she is gone away to God, and Emma

79
will soon go to her. Don't leave her, papa; pray,
don't leave her till she is quite gone.' Then the child

put her arm round his neck, and kissed him several
times. 'And, papa,' added she, 'let little brother

come to us. I want to see my dear little brother again,
and I have a great deal to say to him before I quite go.'
'Well, well,' replied Sir Arthur, hastily, 'we will see
about it.' He then turned away, and taking the child
into his library, he withdrew from her for some minutes
before he could enter into discourse with her again.
As spring drew on, and the appearance of health
faded more and more from Emma's cheek, Sir Arthur
became daily less anxious to leave Montgomery, and he
sent orders for his little boy's immediate return.
Meanwhile, that I may not enter into too many par-
ticulars, I must only add, that he seemed to find an
increasing, though melancholy, satisfaction in his little
girl's company; and it was sweet to observe the pains
which the little creature took to engage him in reli-
gion. She w6uld often find verses in her Bible, and
bring them to him, and ask him to read them, and
then inquire if he did not think them very pretty.
Sometimes she would get on his knee, and pointing
upwards, tell him she was going to heaven; and, in
her innocent way, describe the glory of heaven, and
repeat to him what her Saviour had done to take a
little sinful baby like her to be with Him, and to see
His glory. She would tell him sometimes it was very

pleasant tQ pray, and that she loved God for his
goodness to her. Various were the means she used
to turn her father's heart to God; and her words
distilled like dew into the hard ground, and were
blessed to his real good.
Sir Arthur's heart seemed to become daily more
alive to feelings of genuine sorrow for his base conduct
to his wife, and it seemed a sort of comfort to him, to
pay that attention to the child which ought to have
been paid to the mother. It was in vain that the best
advice was procured for Emma; and all the fond
attentions of Sir Arthur and Jane were alike thrown
away upon the child. She was, in the beginning of
spring, seized with a violent return of her cough and
other alarming symptoms, and soon confined to her
bed. Sir A*rthur was continually by her bedside, and
the convictions of the penitent were now mingling
themselves with the sympathies of the parent. The
Bible, which Emma had put in his hand, he now
opened for her consolation and his own improve-
ment.
The clergyman was sent for, and Sir Arthur listened
with eager attention to his instructions to the little
dying girl. Sometimes his convictions would break

forth in tears, though as yet his parental feelings were
all that he disclosed to those who surrounded him.
At other times his thankfulness for the faith, and
humility, and patience of his child, engaged every
feeling of his heart.
As the child became weaker, she seemed more and
more anxious for her brother's return. A careful
female servant was sent for him, who was to have ac-
companied Clara and her little charge into the country;
but Clara, finding that Emma was dying, and that
Jane was at the hall, declined returning to Mont-
gomery, and engaged in another service in London:
though, some time after, hearing the particulars of
Emma's last hours from Jane, whom she accidentally
met, she was much affected by them, and became, in
the course of time, a much more serious character.
Emma was very much delighted when she heard of
her little brother's arrival; but when he was brought
up to her, and placed on her bed, she was so much
affected, that he was obliged to be taken from her
again, till she was more recovered.
Soon after this meeting, being alone with her papa,
she said to him, 'Papa, I have a very, very great
favour to ask of you. My poor little brother has got

no nurse now; and when Emma is gone, may Jane be
his nurse?'
Sir Arthur making no answer at first, she said, ' Oh,
papa, do not be angry with me for asking this. When
you were away, papa, or busy, papa, and mamma was
gone to God, Jane was the only friend I had. She
never left me, but treated me like mamma did: and
she taught me to read the Bible, and pray, and to love
my Saviour; and told me how to get my naughty
heart made white and clean; and she made me happy,
papa, and punished me when I was naughty; and I
know that she will do the same for my little brother.
Oh, papa, do let her nurse him, and take care of
him; do, pray, papa!'
'My child,' replied Sir Arthur, throwing his arms
round her neck, 'I cannot refuse you anything. Jane
shall take care of Arthur as long as he is in want of a
nurse.'
'And then, papa,' said Emma, 'when my little
brother does not want to be nursed, will you still take
care of Jane, poor Jane? For Emma's sake, papa,
don't send her away again, but let her be taken
care of.'
'She shall, my child,' answered Sir Arthur: 'but I
o 2

cannot part with you yet, indeed I cannot;' and the
tears, as he spoke, burst from his eyes.
The little creature kissed the tears from her papa's
cheeks. 'Don't cry, dear papa,' said she, laying her
little hand on his cheek, and stroking it: 'I am going
to God, and I shall see mamma, and be so happy; and
you shall come too, papa, and Jane, and little brother.
I shall not be naughty any more. My Saviour has
died for me, and washed away my sins in His blood;
and I am going to live with Him for ever. You will
follow me, papa, won't you? Don't cry, papa, because
I go first. I am a poor little sick baby; but when I
die, I shall fly about the blue sky, and be so beautiful
and so happy! Dear papa, do not cry any more.'
The child seemed exhausted with the effort she had
made; so Sir Arthur laid down her head gently on
the pillow, and retired to give vent to his feelings,
calling Jane first to sit by her.
As Sir Arthur sat alone in his study, a thousand
new feelings arose in his mind. A lively view of the
happiness he had thrown away, and the sin he had
incurred, rushed on his mind, and for a time almost
drove him to despair; till the remembrance of a sweet
encouraging promise to a returning sinner, which

Emma had shown him, flashed on his mind, and
brought with it a ray of hope, which he indulged, till
he felt emboldened to pour out his heart in prayer
before his Saviour: and here, in confession, in faith,
and penitence, he met with a peace of mind he had
never tasted before: and an hour passed away, an
hour so sweet and refreshing as he had never yet
experienced, even in the height of his highest worldly
enjoyment. So that, when he arose from his knees,
he could have said with the apostle, ' It is good for me
to be here.' Such encouragements in the uphill path
of duty are often afforded to the returning prodigal.
In the meantime the little Emma recovered herself
by a refreshing sleep; and when she awoke, and saw
Jane sitting by her bedside, she held out her hand to
her, and she said, 'Oh, dear Jane, I am so glad!
Papa says, that when I die, you are to take care of
little brother, and never to go quite away. I am so
glad! And pray, dear Jane, make little Arthur a
good boy. He has got, you know, some naughty
tricks, and goes into passions, and likes to have his
own way. Perhaps poor Clara did not know how to
make him good; and he cannot tell his letters, and
can't, you know, read the Bible: and then, Jane, when

you heard him say his prayers last night, he stared
about him so, and did not seem to mind. Will you,
dear Jane, take great pains with him—I mean, as long
as he is let to be with you—and try to make him a
good little boy, and talk to him about God and our
Saviour, and tell him about heaven, and that mamma
is gone there, and little sister Emma, I hope? Then
do, dear Jane, talk to him as you used to talk to me,
and make him a good little boy: I mean, try to make
him good, because, you know, you can't really make
him good, without God's helpi'
Jane's tears prevented her making any answer; and
the little girl became uneasy, because she feared she
was unwilling to do what she asked. So stooping
under Jane's face, and looking earnestly up at her,
'Won't you, Jane, take care of him? not for little
Emma's sake, when she is quite gone? Oh, do, pray,
dear Jane!' and then she threw her arms round
Jane's neck, and she said, 'Oh, say you will, Jane,
and I shall be so glad, and I will love you so!'
'Oh, my dear, dear young lady,' answered Jane,
'I am not unwilling, but I could not answer you.
Next to taking care of you, I had rather take care of
your little brother than do anything in the world; and,

87
indeed, I will do everything in my power to make him
a good boy; and I am sure God's blessing will be with
him.'
Emma seemed now quite contented; and she begged
her little brother might be brought, and made Jane
take him on her lap, and bade him put his little dimpled
arms round her neck, and kiss her. And she added,
'Brother, you must love Jane, and mind what she
says; for you do not know what a kind friend she is
to me. When dear mamma went to God, she was like
mamma to me.''
The little girl was proceeding in her way to give her
brother much wise counsel; but the little rosy fellow,
full of health and spirits, bounded from Jane's
lap, quite regardless of what his sister said to him.
Little Emma seemed satisfied, now she had settled
this favourite point with her papa and Jane, and seemed
as if she had nothing more to do than to prepare for
her rest in her heavenly Father's mansion. She became
daily more weak, and sometimes suffered a great deal
of pain, which she bore with great patience, never
murmuring or complaining. Erom time to time she
was heard repeating to herself verses in the Bible, and
parts of little hymns which Jane had taught her. When

88
MEMOIRS OF EMMA
she was tolerably well, she often spoke to her little
brother, and Jane, and her father, in the most kind and
affectionate manner, expressing her humility, her faith,
and her hope, in a sweet, simple, childish way, but in
a manner so heavenly, that she seemed already an
inhabitant of another and better place.
The clergyman often came to see her, and her father
and Jane were almost always with her. As Jane sat
by her, as she lay dozing, she would remember the
time, when first a little rosy, blooming child, she had
undertaken the care of her; and much as she had
loved her, she could not but acknowledge that the care
of her heavenly Father had far surpassed that of the
tenderest parent; and she felt a sweet satisfaction, in
the midst of all her sorrow, in resigning her babe to its
Saviour and heavenly Guardian. Every day, as it
passed, diminished the feeble strength of the little
sufferer; and now her last day arrived, a day to be
followed by a cloudless morning without a night.
Her last hours were calm, but not without some
struggle. One of the few last things she was able to
say was to her father. She had seemed long to have
some indistinct idea that all was not right with him.
She looked very earnestly in his face. 'Dear, dear

AND HER NURSE.
89
papa!' she said, 'I am going to mamma! I am going
to God! Will you come too? Do come; pray, do
come, dear papa! Jesus Christ is the way—He can
wash sinners—white—He has washed naughty Emma
white.'
'I know He is the way, my child,' answered Sir
Arthur, ' and I know He can wash away my sins, vile
as I am; and I do hope,' added he earnestly, kissing
his child with tears, 'I do hope to see you again; and
—and your much-injured mother.'
The child seemed satisfied, and said no more. Once
she tried afterwards to lay her brother's hand in Jane's,
when he was placed on the bed by her; and she said
faintly, 'Dear Arthur, be a good boy.'
Jane scarcely ever moved from her bedside that day;
and Emma, from time to time, looked earnestly and
affectionately at her, but appeared too feeble to speak:
her chief thoughts seemed taken up with the glory she
was going to, and sweet feelings of thankfulness to her
God and Saviour, for their mercy to a sinful child.
Such seemed her dying feelings, from the few broken
words which dropped from her lips, and from the hope,
and joy, and love which often shone in her pale features.
At length the struggle gradually ceased, and her mortal

part calmly sunk into its last sleep; and her immortal
part, bursting from its prison, soared into endless day.
So speedily, so happily was the race of this lovely
infant run, before she had completed her seventh year.
Jane closed her eyes, and performed the last offices
for the little sleeping remains, about which she had so
sweetly and so often employed herself; but, sad as
was the office, she could not but joyfully think
of the blessed exchange the triumphant spirit had
made.

CONCLUSION.
It is now time to draw to a close the memoirs of the
infant Emma. We must not, therefore, enter into too
many particulars. She was buried by her mother. Sir
Arthur followed as chief mourner, and her little brother
in the arms of Jane. There never was more sincere
and universal mourning for so young a child; for her
history was now very generally known through the
neighbourhood. The sincerity of Jane's sorrow was
evidenced, and best evidenced, by the assiduous atten-
tion she paid to little Arthur, who very soon rewarded
her for all her exertions, by his improvements in every-
thing good. He had never before been treated properly,
or been taught anything really valuable; but now he
gave promise of becoming a truly good boy. He re-
mained under Jane's care, according to Emma's dying
request, till he was of an age to be placed under a
tutor; and Sir Arthur selected such a-tutor for him as
was not only calculated to make him a scholar, but a
real gentleman and a real Christian.

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
When the little boy was removed from Jane's care,
Sir Arthur, mindful of his promise, placed her entirely
with the housekeeper, who was becoming very old, that
she might be an assistance to her, and likewise gain that
knowledge which would enable her to fill the same
situation; and when, at the distance of twelve years
after Emma's death, the old housekeeper retired into
her own country upon a salary which she received from
Sir Arthur, Jane was put into her situation, and shortly
after married the house-steward, a sensible, pious, and
active man, who had been appointed by Sir Arthur to
that office upon the death of the old house-steward.
Sir Arthur's health gradually declined more and
more; but he lived to see his son come of age, a
most promising young man, resembling -his father only
in person, and the wiser qualities of his latter years.
Sir Arthur closed his days at Montgomery, where he
had for some time evidenced the sincerity of his re-
pentance by his regular habits, his piety, and his charity.
Every little improvement which his lady had formerly
planned for the advancement of piety, and the happi-
ness of his tenantry and the poor, he had laboured to
bring about; and her prayers and meek labours in faith
seemed now all answered and crowned, in a peculiar

manner, both for her husband, her children, her school,
and all in any way connected with her.
Sir Arthur requested that, upon his death, the follow-
ing text might be added to the inscription on the white
marble monument he had raised to her memory: 'Cast
thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
many days' (Eccl. xi. 1).
Sir Arthur was buried by his lady and their little
girl.
When the young Sir Arthur had paid his last duty to
his father, he prepared for his removal to his Yorkshire
estates, and gave up the property which his father had
rented in Montgomery. He insisted upon Jane and
her husband still occupying the same situation in his
family which they had done in his father's; and Jane,
having witnessed the death of her parents, and seen
her brothers and sisters settled in the world, could not
object to accompany Sir Arthur's family into Yorkshire;
though she could not quit Montgomery, which memory
ever endeared to her, without many a pang. But to be
faithful in the discharge of her important duties to the
brother and son of the persons who had been so very
dear to her, was one of the highest satisfactions she
could receive.

MEMOIRS OF EMMA
Sir Arthur shortly afterwards married a lady in
every respect worthy to bear the name of Lady
Harewood.
The character and conduct of Jane remained still
consistent; for, from a sincere desire to please God,
she was faithful in the diligent discharge of her duty
to her master and mistress; and thus she obtained the
continued steady regard of Sir Arthur, and afterwards
of his lady, and their children also, who were taught
to consider her as a kind of mother.
Sir Arthur insisted upon her bringing up her own
two children in his house; so that she lived, as it were,'
in the midst of a family of dutiful children, all vying
in the desire to repay to her the care and tenderness
which she had in her youth bestowed upon the mother-
less babes of her beloved lady; and the memory of
her maternal care of the little Emma, was as a crown
adorning the brow of her later years.
At an advanced age, full of honour, surrounded by
her own children and grandchildren, and the children
and grandchildren of Sir Arthur, Jane departed this
life, with a hope full of immortality, after many years
of patient obedience to her Father's will, and humble
reliance on her Saviour's merits; leaving an example

which, it is hoped, may be followed by those young
people who may hereafter be called to the sweet and
honourable employment of training up in any way the
lambs of their Master's flock.
A faithful and diligent discharge of the duties of a
wife, a mother, or a nurse, will never fail of meeting,
sooner or later, with some degree of success, if under-
taken in faith, and performed in patience.
That these lessons may be learned from the history
of Lady Harewood and her nursemaid Jane, is the
prayer and earnest desire of the relater of the simple
memoirs of the infant Emma.

THE
MOTHER'S GRAVE.
Atf old gentleman was travelling. through Wales, in
his carriage with his granddaughter, who was about
fourteen years of age. He arrived one Saturday night
at the pleasant town of Montgomery; and as he made
a point of never travelling on a Sunday, he determined
to remain there all the next day.
The same evening, as they were sitting together
after supper, Mary (which was the name of the little
girl) informed her grandpapa that the landlady had
been telling her what a pretty church there was at
Montgomery, and what a beautiful hill was to be seen
from the churchyard. 'And, grandpapa,' she added,
'there are a great many lime-trees growing in it; you
know, you love lime-trees. If it is a fine morning,
grandpapa, perhaps you will like to walk there a little,
before service begins, and look at this beautiful
mountain.'

'Very well, my dear,' answered her grandpapa, 'I
have no objection. But now, Mary,' added he, 'you
must lend me your eyes, and put down our expenses;
we have not cast them up since we left your mother's
house, which was on Thursday.'
So Mary jumped up, and fetched a pen and ink,
and was ready in an instant to do what she was bid.
The old gentleman took out his purse, and counted
his money; and then, rubbing his face with his hand,
he employed himself in recollecting how his money had
been spent; and he slowly told Mary all the particulars.
'And now, grandpapa,' said Mary,' it is all set down,
and I have cast it up, and it is right.'
'Very well, my dear,' answered the old gentleman, 'it
is quite right.' Then he carefully replaced his money in
his purse, except two guineas, which he laid side by
side on the table. And when he had put his purse in
his pocket, 'Mary, he said, before we return to your
mother's house, we shall pass through many towns, and
perhaps you may like now and then to buy some-
thing which you may see; I will therefore give you
these two guineas to do what you please with; all I
beg is, that I may know exactly how you spend them.'
'Thank you, dear grandpapa; thank you,' answered
Mary, courtseying and smiling.
H

THE MOTHER'S GRAVE.
Mary had never before in her life been so rich,
and she now began to remember a hundred things
which she wanted; and she not only remembered
them, but began to repeat them all over to her grand-
papa.
'Well, my dear,' said the old gentleman,'I think I
must not hear all this long account to-night. How-
ever, I must just remind you, that the first and best use
which we can make of the mammon of unrighteousness
is, to lay it out for the glory of God, and the good
of our fellow-creatures.'
Mary then wished her grandpapa a good-night, and
went upstairs to bed.
She was up early the next morning, and employed
herself in reading her Bible, till it was time to go
down, and make breakfast for her grandpapa.
Breakfast was over by ten o'clock. 'And now,
grandpapa,' said Mary, 'would you like to go to the
churchyard?'
In a little while the old gentleman was ready. He
had a gold-headed cane in one hand, and with his
other arm he leaned upon Mary; and his servant fol-
lowed with a great-coat, though the weather at present
was so warm that it was not very likely he should
want it. They walked slowly down the cheerful street,

99
and soon arrived at the churchyard. The warm sun
shone bright on the gravel-walk, and the old gentle-
man enjoyed it very much; the lime-blossoms over

their heads were very sweet. 'This is a pleasant place,
certainly,' said the old gentleman; 'and it is so warm,
I think we might venture to sit down.'

'Here, grandpapa, is a tombstone, upon which you
may sit nicely in the sun,' said Mary, 'and you may
have a beautiful view of that fine mountain.'
The old gentleman sat down, and Mary seated her-
self on a low stone at his feet: yet she did not sit
long, for she was continually getting up, walking a
few yards, first on one side and then on the other,
pointing out to her grandpapa various pleasant objects
which were before them.
Cawndon spread its broad side exactly opposite to the
churchyard. Its top was hazy, but it gradually sloped
into sunny fields, orchards, and little glens, which
-fringed its base; and Mary fancied how many delight-
ful walks she might take among the pretty thatched
cottages, sloping copses, and green valleys which were
before her. All these lovely objects she pointed out
to her grandpapa. 'And then, grandpapa,' she added,
'I hear wood-pigeons and blackbirds in the wood.
Oh, what sweet sounds! This little green lane below
the churchyard, I dare say, would soon lead us into
that sweet country, for it seems very near to us.'
'This beautiful prospect,' said the old gentleman,
should lead us, Mary, to love and praise the great
Creator :' 0 all ye green things upon the earth, bless
ye the Lord; praise him, and magnify him for ever!'

'That is what we chant at the cathedral, when we
are at home,' answered Mary.
'If this world,' continued the old gentleman,'which
is so defaced by sin, has such remains of beauty, and
is so lovejy, what must that world be where sin can
never enter?'
Just as the old gentleman finished these words, a
sound of children's voices caught Mary's ear, and she
got up to see from whence they came; and she per-
ceived, winding up the green lane, a little family of
children. First walked a little boy, about nine years
of age, with a basket of flowers in his hand; then
came a girl, rather taller than himself, carrying an
infant about a year old; and last followed another
little boy, who, from his manner of walking, seemed
much tired. They made their way towards a fresh
grave, which lay near the spot where the old gentle-
man was sitting; but a yew-tree being between them,
the children did not seem to be aware that anybody
was near.
'Here she sleeps,' said the boy.
The girl sat down by the grave, and placed the
child on the grass by her side, and the little boy joined
them. The girl seemed hot, and wiped her face; but
Mary thought that she was wiping tears away.

The eldest boy then proceeded to dress the grave
with the flowers he had brought, according to a custom
which is usual in some parts of Wales.
'Can she hear what we say ?' asked the little boy,
who had been watching his brother for some Jime.
'No, to be sure,' answered the eldest boy.
'Why, they put her in here,' said the child,' the
day they took her away, and we cried so.'
'That was her body,' answered the little girl; 'but
her soul is in heaven, up there above that blue sky.'
'How do you know that?' asked the little boy.
'Because she loved our Saviour Jesus Christ,' replied
the girl; 'and Jesus Christ died upon the cross for her.'
'Grandpapa,' whispered Mary, 'do you hear those
children?' Then getting up, and treading lightly on
tiptoe, she went close up to them. 'Whose grave is this,
little boy,' said she,' that you are dressing with flowers?'
'It is mother's,' answered the boy. 'She has been
here a whole week,' added he.
'Did you love her?' asked Mary.
'Oh, very much!' answered1 the little girl; 'and
we have nobody now to dress us, and wash us, and
make us good.'
'Where is your father?' asked Mary.
'He went away after mother was put in the ground,'

answered she; 'and he said he would come back again;
but he is not come back, and all our bread is gone.'
'And we are come here to ask for some,' said the boy.
'Where,' said Mary, ' are you going to ask for it?'
'Why, there,' answered the boy; 'to the church,
to be sure.'
'What! are you going to get bread there?'
'Yes,'answered the boy; 'mother told us, the day
she died, that whenever we wanted anything, we must
ask God to give it us; and so we are all come to
church to ask God to give us some bread.'
'And you do think he will hear you?' asked
Mary.
'Yes,' answered the boy,' because Jesus Christ died
upon the cross for us. Mother said, that God had
always heard her for His sake, and that he had taken
care of her all her life long, and that He was going to
take her to glory.'
'Yes,' added the sister,' and she said, that He would
always take care of us, if we would love our Lord
Jesus Christ, and try to be good children.'
'And so He will,' said the old gentleman, rising
from his seat and coming towards them.
'And have you had no bread this morning?' asked
Mary.

THE MOTHER'S GRAVE.
'No,' answered the boy. 'Brother, and sister, and
I have had none; we gave the last bit to the baby.'
'Oh, grandpapa!' said Mary,'what shall we do?'
Her purse, with its two guineas, was in her hand in
a minute.
'My dear,' answered her grandpapa, as he wiped a
tear from his eye, 'we must do nothing in haste. I
understand that there is a very worthy clergyman in
this parish; after church I will see him, and make
some inquiries from him respecting these children.
However, you may direct them to go to the inn when
service is over; at any rate we may give them a trifle.'
Mary made haste to -give her directions to the
children, and she had scarcely finished them when the
bells began to chime for church; and the congregation
going into the church, the old gentleman called Mary
to follow them.
When service was over, and they were out of church,
Mary put her purse of guineas into her grandpapa's
hand; and she said, 'Now, grandpapa, you are going
to speak to the clergyman; please to give him this to
lay out for the children.'
'Very well, Mary,' answered the old gentleman.
He then returned with Mary to the inn, where he
told her to distribute a loaf and some cold meat to the

little ones, who were there before her, while he paid a
visit, attended by his servant, to the clergyman's house.
As the boy received the bread and meat in his little
basket, Mary said to him, 'Now you see that God has
heard your prayer, and given you bread. It was God
who sent grandpapa here to-day to help you. You
must try to be good children, and remember what your
poor mother, who is in heaven, taught you; and then
God will always hear you, and give you what is really
good for you, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
The little children looked at the basket,' and then at
Mary, with joyful faces; then bowing and courtseying
low, they thanked her, and wished her good-day.
Soon after the little happy party were gone, the old
gentleman returned. Mary made haste to meet him,
and take his cane from him, and placed a chair for
him.
'Well, grandpapa,' said she.
'Well, Mary,' answered the old gentleman,' I have
good news for you; our little children are no deceivers.
Their mother was a pious woman, who had earnestly
tried to bring her little children to the feet of her
Saviour. The clergyman visited her in her last sick-

sorry to say, so worthy a person as his wife was.
'But our good friend has promised to inquire more
particularly into the situation and conduct of this man,
and' to try to persuade him to act a Christian's and a
father's part: but if this cannot be done, he will endea-
vour to get his children placed under the care of a
worthy relation; and I have made arrangements for
their being sent to school, and properly instructed.
Perhaps, on our return, we may call and see how they
are going on.'
'Oh, yes,' said Mary, ' do let us call and see them, if
you please, grandpapa!'
'And here is your purse, Mary, with one of the
guineas in it. One of them is to be laid out on clothes
and other necessary things for the children, and the
other I return you. I know, Mary, that there are many
little things which might be useful to yourself and your
sisters which you would like to buy; I did not therefore
choose to part with both your guineas. You must look

Mary smiled, and thanked her grandpapa, as she took

'And now, my dear,' said he to his attentive grand-
daughter, ' I have only one little request to make you:
We will stay a few hours at Montgomery to-morrow
morning; and as you know how to use your pencil
nicely, you shall take a sketch of the churchyard, and
the fine mountain, and the lime trees; which you shall
finish at your leisure hours, as we travel along. And
when it is finished, it shall be hung up in' my study;
and you shall draw the little children kneeling round
their mother's grave, and dressing it with flowers. And
under it I will have this verse written: "I have been
young, and now am old, yet never saw I the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging their bread."'
