‘ PREFACE.
PHANTASMION, the product of the enforced leisure on a
sick bed of Sara Coleridge, was ﬁrst given to the world in
1837; and although the book received warm and hearty
commendation both privately and publicly from those
who read it, the success which then attended it neither
equalled in any degree its own singular merit, nor was
what might have been expected, from the approbation
the book met with at the hands of those best qualiﬁed
to judge. I have always believed that this was in great
measure owing to the mode of its publication. It was
an expensive book, with no author’s name, without a
single illustration, and the edition was limited to two
The publisher, Mr Pickering,
doubted apparently the possibility of its being popular ;
hundred and ﬁfty copies.
and except that he printed it with all the care and
beauty which marked every book he put forth, he seems
almost to have determined that, as far as depended upon

published at nine shillings, had little chance in those
days of forcing its way into general circulation. The
few copies sold slowly, and were at length exhausted.
The book has long been out of print; and even amongst
men of letters, and men interested in the character and
admiring the genius of Sara Coleridge, it is almost
unknown or forgotten. .
The book, as now revived, appeals to a larger audience
and a new generation ; to readers who know the author,
and who are already to some extent acquainted with
the power, the grace, the reﬁnement of her mind. They
will be prepared to ﬁnd in this, her only work of ﬁction,
her longest continuous original composition, the delicate
imagination, the melody of verse, the clear and pic-
turesque language, the virginal purity of conception,
which are to be found in this book by those who look
for them. Indeed, these things do not need searching
for; they lie upon the surface.
It may be said that this is exaggerated language to
use about a fairy tale, which is nothing but a fairy tale;
into which.no moral is intruded, the characters of which
are slightly indicated only, and never elaborately de-
veloped ; and which is itself an example of a kind of
composition old-fashioned, out of date, and entirely at
odds with the spirit and temper of the time we live in.
No one, however, who reads this book through is likely

to say that I have described it too favourably; and this
edition is an attempt at least to ascertain whether it is
not ﬁtted for general readers, and may not achieve a
general and lasting popularity.
Some time ago it would have been by no means super-
ﬂuous to plead for fairy tales as entitled to a distinct
and useful place in the cultivation of the intellect, and
as having an important function to perform in a sensible
and practical education. But this is hardly necessary
now. We have, indeed, still too much of the directly
moral and instructive tale, of stories wherein the interest
turns upon small incidents of daily life, which are
invested with a moral importance altogether unreal and
exaggerated; the tendency of the whole tale being too
often to foster a morbid self-introspection, and a diseased
and effeminate religion. But there are signs of a healthy
change; and if the number of good books, and books
of what is called useful knowledge, is still somewhat
overwhelming, the use of works of pure fancy is at least
now generally admitted, and thefgood sense of culti-
vating the imagination is not disputed. Indeed, in
England, and for most of us, it would be hard-hearted
to dispute it. When we think of the grim and unlovely
lives, which the great body of the English people is
doomed to lead, their dreary toil, their dull homes, their
harsh surroundings, it is surely wise as well as merciful,

to try to give them glimpses of things more beautiful
and lofty than their daily life affords, and to enrich
at least their minds with pictures of brighter scenes, and
their hearts with happier thoughts, than are before them
and within them, in the state in which their lot is for
the most part cast. Phantasmion does not pretend to
teach directly any moral lesson; it is not a sermon in
disguise; but most people will be better and happier
while they read it, and after they have read it too.
It stands alone, or almost alone, in fairy literature in the
nature of its fancies, and in the extent and completeness
of its narrative. Its supernatural beings have no English
originals; perhaps indeed they have rather 'a German
than an English character. The Legends of Number
Nip, and the exquisite fancy of Undine are their nearest
prototypes. But the various powers and spirits of earth,
and sea, and sky, some gentle and comparatively weak,
like Feydeleen the Flower Spirit, some stern and terrible,
like Oloola the Spirit of the Storm, or Valhorga the
gigantic Earth Spirit, have more of the bright and fresh
Greek, or early Latin imagination in them than any
other or later mythology.
The scenery of the tale is that of Cumberland and
Westmorland, only under a brighter sky and with a softer
climate. To me the descriptive power of it seems very
uncommon. The characters are, as I have said, slightly

drawn; the passion is not deep or strong; yet we are
carried on by a very interesting story, and few readers
but will regret when they end it. The English is pure
and clear and vigorous. The verses are very lovely,'
always full of delicate fancy, sometimes rising into high
imagination, and exhibiting, in the management of
lyrical measures, often difﬁcult and peculiar, the metrical
melody and reﬁnement, which in her case at.least were ~
an hereditary gift. As a rule, the poems are closely
connected with the prose which surrounds them, and
cannot without great disadvantage be taken out of their
dramatic setting. It is not always so however; and
many of them would be exquisite songs and lyrics if
printed independently, and read separate and uncon-
nected poems. Those beginning “ One face alone,”
“ The winds were whispering,” and “Sylvan Stag
securely play” (to take only two or three examples out
of a number), are surely worthy of any great lyrical
writer. ,
Indeed, the general literary excellence of the book ﬁts
it for all readers and all ages. The perfect purity of the
story, its freshness, its beauty, its interest, ﬁt it especially
for the young. With such readers at least, according
to a limited experience, it has been most successful.
The fairies and spirits of the book, its heroes and its
witches, its maidens and its kings, have been, and may

be again, household words with intelligent children, and
may once more live, as they have lived already, in their
minds, and give names and characters, to their bright
and pleasant play. The success of Phantasmion has
hitherto been limited indeed, but within limits it has
been complete. I would fain hope that there is in store
for it a success not less complete, but far less limited.
It remains only to say why this Preface has been
written. It is done at the request of those who have a
much better right to do it, and who would have done it
much better; and because it is a pleasure to be con-
nected, in however humble a sort, with one who was
the teacher of my childhood, the friend of my youth
and manhood, and who is now, in the decline of life, a
precious, indeed a sacred memory.

L’ENVOY OF PHANTASMION.
Go, little book, and sing of love and beauty,
To tempt the worldling into fairy land ;
Tell him that airy dreams are sacred duty,
Bring better wealth than aught his toils command—-
Toils fraught with mickle harm.
But if thou meet some spirit high and tender,
On blessed works and noblest love intent,
Tell him that airy dreams of nature’s splendour,
With graver thoughts and hallowed musings hlent,
Prove no too earthly charm.

PH ANTASMION.

CHAPTER I.
THE FAIRY POTENTILLA APPEARS TO THE YOUNG PRINCE
PHANTASMION.
A YOUNG boy hid himself from his nurse in sport, and
strayed all alone in the garden of his father, a rich and
mighty prince; he followed the bees from ﬂower to
ﬂower, and wandered further than .he had ever gone
before, 'till he came to the hollow tree where they hived,
and watched them entering their storehouse laden with
the treasures they had collected ; he lay upon the turf
laughing and talking to himself, and, after a while, he
plucked a long stiff blade of grass, and was about to
thrust it in at the entrance of the hive, when a voice
just audible above the murmur of the bees, cried “ Phan-
tasmion”! Now the child thought that his nurse was
calling him in strange tones, and he started, saying, “Ah !
Leeliba !” and looked round; but casting up his eyes he saw
that there stood before him an ancient woman, slenderer in
ﬁgure than his nurse, yet more ﬁrm and upright, and
with a countenance which made him afraid. “ What
dost thou here, Phantasmion ?" said the stranger to

the little boy, and he made no answer: then she looked
sweetly upon the child, for he was most beautiful, and
she said to him, “ Whom dost thou take me for ? ” and
he replied, “At ﬁrst I took thee for my nurse, but now
I see plainly that thou art not like her.” “And how
am I different from thy nurse ?" said the strange
woman. The boy was about to answer, but he stopped
short and blushed; then after a pause he said, “One
thing, that thou hast wings upon thy shoulders, and she
has none.” “Phantasmion!” she replied, “I am not
like thy nurse: I can do that which is beyond her
skill, great as thou thinkest it.” At this the boy
laughed, and said with a lively countenance, pointing to
the hollow tree, “ Could’st thou make the bees that have
gone in there ﬂy out of their hive all in one'swarm ?”
The fairy staid not to answer, but touched the decayed
trunk with her wand, and the bees poured out of their
receptacle by thousands and thousands, and hung in a
huge cluster from the branch of ’a sycamore ; and as the
child looked upon the swarm, it seemed to be composed
' of living diamonds, and glanced so brilliantly in the sun-
shine that it dazzled the sight. And the beautiful boy
laughed aloud, and leaped into the air, and clapped his
hands for joy. Then the fairy placed her wand within
his little palm, saying, “ Strike the tree, and say, ‘Go
in !’ and they shall all ‘enter the hive again.” The cheeks
of the young boy blushed brighter than ever, and his
eyes sparkled, as he struck the hollow trunk with all his
might, and cried, “Go in ! Go in! !” No sooner had he
done this than the whole‘ multitude quitted the branch
of the sycamore, and disappeared within the body of the
tree. ~ '

Then the ancient woman said. to the little prince,
" Wilt thou give me that pomegranate T’ and she pointed
to the only ripe one which grew on ai tree hard by.
One member of the trunk of this pomegranate tree
leaned forward, and invited the adventurous child ‘to
mount ; he quickly crept along it, and having’ plucked the
fruit which the fairy had pointed out, he turned round and
tried to descend :' but ﬁnding that he should slip if he
attempted to return by the way he came, having measured
the height from the ground with his eye, he boldly
sprang at once from the bough to the turf below, and
presented his prize to the stranger. With that she took
it ’ from his hand, and, looking kindly upon him, she
said, “ My little Phantasmion, thou needest no fairy now
to work wonders for thee, being yet so young that all
thou beholdest is new and marvellous in thine eyes.
But the day must come when this happiness will fade
away; when the stream, less clear than at its outset, will
no longer return such bright reﬂections; then, if thou
wilt repair to this pomegranate tree, and call upon the
name of Potentilla, I will appear before thee, and‘ exert
all my power to renew the delights and wonders of
thy childhood."
After speaking these words, Potentilla vanished ; the‘
child opened his eyes wide, and, now feeling afraid to be
alone, he ran homeward as fast as possible, and in a little
time heard the voice of his mother calling .to him in
quick tones ; for she had outrun his nurse, who was also
hastening in search of him. The child bounded up to
her, and with breathless eagerness sought to describe the
strange things which he had seen. “ All the bees came out
in a cluster,” cried he, “and they were dressed in diamonds!

thousands and millions of them hung together upon a
branch ! and I my own self made every one of the bees
go back again into their hive, with the shining stick
which the old woman lent me." “ What old woman ?"
replied Queen Zalia to her little son; “ was it one of the
gardeners’ wives ? ” “ O no !" said he; “ an old woman
with wings on her shoulders, and she ﬂew up and vanished
away, like the bubbles which I blow through my pipe.”
“Thou hast been dreaming, my sweet boy," said his
mother; “ thou hast fallen asleep in the sunshine, and
hast dreamt all this.” “ No, no! my mother,” the child
replied ; “indeed, indeed it was quite unlike those
dreams which I have at night. I wish the bees could
speak that they might tell thee all about it, for they
saw the winged woman as well as I.”

CHAPTER II.
POTENTILLA FULFILS HER rnomisn T0 PHANTASMION.
SOON afterwards Phantasmion’s fair mother, Zalia, fell
sick and died. Her young son was kept from the
chamber of death, and, roaming about the palace in
search of her, he found a little child sitting on the
ﬂoor of a lonely chamber, afraid to stir because he was
by himself. “The people ‘are all gone away,” cried
Phautasmion; “ Come, I will ta,ke thee abroad to see
the pretty ﬂowers, now the sun shines so bright.” The
child was glad to have fresh air and company, and,
holding fast by the older boy’s hand, he sped along
' with short quick steps further than his tiny feet had
ever carried him before, lisping about the bees and
hornets, which, in his ignorance he would fain have
caught, as they buzzed past him, and laughing merrily
when his frolicsome guide led him right through a bed
of feathered columbines, for the sake of seeing the
urchin’s rosy cheek brushed by soft blossoms and
powdered with ﬂower dust. At last they entered the
queen's pleasure ground, where only one gardener
remained, and he was sitting on the path, gathering
berries in a basket. “Where is my mother l” cried
the prince, leaping suddenly behind him; “ hast thou

hidden her away, old man ? ” “ Thy mother is dead !"
answered he, looking up in the boy's face ; and it was
the glance of his eye, more than the words he spoke,
which made Phantasmion shudder. The menial
smoothed his brow, and with humble courtesy offered
a branch of crimson fruit to the young prince, who
ﬂung it on the ground, crying in a haughty tone,
"‘ How darest thou say that my mother is dead ? ” “ Go
II
to her chamber, and see; replied the man sternly.
“ And how can I see her if she is dead '? " rejoined the
boy, with a tremulous laugh ; “ can I see the cloud of
yesterday in yon clear sky ? like clouds the dead vanish
away, and we see them no more", Just then he spied
the young child lying down, with the fruit-branch
dropping out of his ﬁngers, and his face buried in a
ﬂowery tuft. “ What! hiding among the hearts-
ease?” cried he; “ah! let me hide too.” Then,
putting his face close to that of his charge, “ How
cold the little cheek is ! ” he cried; “come, raise it
up to the warm sun.” Hearing these words the
gardener turned'the child's face upwards, and behold
he was dead ; his lips smeared with berry juice, and his
pale swollen cheeks covered with purple spots! Then
he held out the body to the startled boy, and showing
the slack limbs and glazed eye, while his own shot ﬁre
like that of a panther :—“ So look the dead,” cried he,
“ ere they vanish away: just so Queen Zalia is looking!".
Phantasmion shrieked, and hastening home, he met his
mother’s funeral procession going forth from the palace.
‘The body was wrapped in a shroud, and black plumes
nodded over the face ; but he saw the dead hands, and
the limbs stretched upon the bier. From that time

forth he never spoke of Queen Zalia, but he often be-
held her in dreams, and often he dreamed of the old
man who told him she was dead, and who disappeared,
on the same day, from the royal household.
Phantasmion grieved but little when his father died
a year afterwards; for he scarcely knew King Dori-
mant’s face, that warlike prince having been wholly
engaged, since the birth of his child, in a fruitless
search after mines of iron. It was commonly believed
that ill success in this matter hastened his end; but the
people about the palace well knew that he died of eating
poisoned honey. '
Thus Phantasmion was yet too young, when he in-
herited the throne of Palmland, to be a king in‘ reality;
and those who governed the land sought to keep him a
child as long as possible. They prevented him from
learning how to reign, but could. not succeed in making
him content with mere pomp and luxury; for his plea-
sures were so closely set that they hindered one another’s
growth, and, by the time that he attained to his full
stature, nothing gratiﬁed him, except the society of a
noble youth who came to visit his court from a foreign
country, and who interested his mind by curious his-
tories and glowing descriptions. Dariel of Tigridia
was well skilled in the management of fruit trees and
ﬂowers; he had brought seeds of many ﬁne sorts from
distant lands, and at the desire of Phantasmion, he
sowed them in the royal garden. One morning‘ he
came' to the prince, saying, “ The rare plant has put
forth leaves; come and look at it!” “ Earlier even
than we expected I” cried the prince, rising joyfully
from his seat. “I will not only see, but taste and

try.” The two youths took their way through a
ﬂowery labyrinth, talking much of the wondrous plant
and the virtues of its leaves; but just as they were
drawing nigh to the nook where it grew, several scor-
pions fastened all at once on Dariel’s sandaled foot, and
stung it with such violence, that, quitting his comrade’s
arm, he sprang into the air, and then fell prostrate
under the towering lilies. Phantasmion carried him to
the palace, and placed him tenderly on a couch. After
a time, seeing that he continued in a languishing state,
he made an infusion of the leaves which his friend had ,
so highly extolled, and silently gave it to Dariel instead
of the drink which the physician had ordered ; but, just
as he expected to see the poor youth revived by this
kind act, his head sank on the pillow, a blue tinge stole
over his cheek, and, when the prince had gazed upon his
altered face for a few minutes, he plainly saw that it
told no longer of sickness, but of death. Not, however,
till decay had wrought a still more ghastly change in
Dariel’s comely countenance, Phantasmion quitted the
side of his couch; then, overpowered with sorrow, he
roamed abroad, and sought the forest of lilies which his
comrade’s hand had reared: the sun was bright, the
air fresh,‘ but all that ﬂowery multitude was drooping
and ready to perish; cankerworms had gnawed their
roots, and the wondrous plant itself had been attacked
by such numbers of insects that scarce a trace of it
remained.
This circumstance deepened the melancholy which had
seized on the spirit of Phantasmion. He began to think
that all persons and things connected with himself were
doomed to misfortune; and when this channel of thought

was once opened, a hundred rills poured into it at once,
and ﬁlled it to the brim. .
He reﬂected on the early deaths of his father and
mother, as he had never reﬂected on them before: the
black plumes and solemn tapers of the chamber where
King Dorimant lay in state rose up before him, while
Zalia stretched on her bier, and the strange man holding
out his little comrade’s body, visited him again as in the
dreams of his childhood. These and other remembrances,
grouped together under one aspect of gloom, all wore the
same visionary twilight hue, and inspired the same sad-
'ness. He turned away from cheerful faces, and was
constantly expecting to see the ghost of Dariel, a shadowy
image of his swollen corse.
Phantasmion had spent many days in this state of
dejection, when he wandered forth after a sleepless night,
one clear morning, and, refreshed by the breath of early
dawn, began to slumber under the boughs of a pome-
granate tree. No sooner had he closed his eyes than the
fairy, whom he had formerly seen on that very spot,
seemed to stand‘ there again. In his dream she touched
him with her wand, and forthwith leafy branches, like
those which drooped over him, sprouted from his shoulders;
imperceptibly those branches changed into green wings
and up he soared, feeling as if his whole body were in-
ﬂated with air. As he'ﬂoated along in the sky a group
of angel faces shone before him: he surveyed them, and
all were lovely, but one was far lovelier than the rest,
and, while he gazed upon that countenance, it grew more
and more exquisite, the others becoming indistinct and
fading gradually away. Suddenly, like a balloon ex-
hausted of air, down he dropped to the earth, and was

snatched away from the vision. “ Potentilla !” he cried
aloud; starting up in the intensity of feeling, and
stretching out both his hands, “ Potentilla! help! help!”
No sooner had he uttered that long forgotten name, than
he opened his eyes, and saw the little old fairy smiling
in his face. “ Phantasmion,” she said, *‘ what shall I
do for thee? I am queen of the insect realm, and powers
like those which insects have, are mine to bestow."
“ Give me wings !” he cried; for still he had a vague
hope that he might once more behold that heavenly face
if he could but soar aloft. .
Potentilla waved her wand, and soon the air was ﬁlled
with butterﬂies, those angel insects pouring from every
region of the heavens. Here came a long train arrayed
in scarlet, waving up and down altogether like a ﬂag of
triumph; there ﬂoated a band clad in deep azure, and
' ﬂanked on either side by troops in golden panoply.
Some were like ﬂights of green leaves, others twinkled
in robes of softest blue’besprent with silver, like young
princesses at a festival ;. and, in front of the whole
multitude, a gorgeous crowd, adorned with peacock eyes,
ﬂew round and round in a thousand starrywheels, while
here and there one butterﬂy would ﬂit aloof for a few
moments, then sink into the circle and revolve indis-
tinguishably with the rest: now the entire wheel ﬂew
oﬁ’ into splinters, now reconstructed itself at once, as if
but a single life informed its several parts.
Again Potentilla waved her wand, and the bloomy
throng descended on trees and shrubs, attiring every
bough in fresh blossoms, which quivered without. a
breeze. Phantasmion saw that he was to choose from
this profusion of specimens the wings that pleased him

best, and he ﬁxed on a set like those which he wore in
his dream. The moment that Potentilla touched him
with her wand a sensation of lightness ran throughout
his body, and instantly afterwards he perceived “that
wings played on his shoulders, wings of golden green
adorned with black embroidery: beneath an emerald
coronet his radiant locks clustered in large soft rings, and
wreathed themselves around his snowy forehead: robes
of white silk ﬂoated over his buoyant limbs, and his full
eyes, lately closed in languor, beamed with joyful expec—
tation, while more. than child-like bloom rose mantling
to his cheek. Potentilla had seen an eagle teaching her
young ones to ﬂy, gradually widening her airy circles,
and mounting in _a spiral line that swelled as it rose,
while the sun burnished her golden plumes; just so she
ﬂew before the winged youth, who timidly followed where
she led the way, trembling in his ﬁrst career when he
saw the earth beneath him. But, gaining conﬁdence,
all at once he shot away from his guide, like a spark ‘
from a sky-rocket; he soared and gyred and darted on
high, describing as many different ﬁgures as a skater on
the ice, while from the groves and ﬂowery meads below
this choral strain resounded :-—
See the bright stranger!
On wings of enchantment,
See how he soars!
Eagles! that high on the crest of the mountain,
/ Beyond Where the cataracts gush from their fountain,
Look out o’er the sea and her glistering shores,
Cast your sun-gazing eyes on his pinions of light
Behold how he glitters
Transcendently bright!

CHAPTER III.
PHANTASMION SEES AND HEARS STRANGE THINGS BY
THE SEA SHORE.
PHANTASMION left the shadows of earth behind him,
while he soared so high that green ﬁelds, and blue
waters, gardens, and groves, all melted into one, and
even that heavenly sight which had ﬁrst made him
pray for wings was itself forgotten in the pleasure of
ﬂying. He thought it a delightful novelty to rush
down upon the heron like the trained hawk, or aim
a javelin at some bird of prey as she stooped upon her
quarry; to whirl upward with the glede, drop down
like a shot side by side with the jer-falcon, disperse
the swallows in the midst of their aerial dances, or
_ sweep the cope of heaven in pursuit of the swift : then
hovering aloft in perfect stillness, with green pinions
and ﬂoating robes, he attracted crowds of gazers, who
marvelled how a bird of paradise could look so large at
such a wondrous height. One ﬁne clear day he ﬂew
southward to the ocean, and pursued a sea eagle to the
' highest ether. At ﬁrst setting off he was rudely
brushed by vultures, hurrying down to feast upon a
carcase which lay rocking on the waves: he thrust
among them with his drawn sword, and pushed onward,
leaving a cloud of his delicate plumelets ﬂuttering in
the air. Having arrived at last where the atmosphere
was too thin for anything but a bird to breathe, he

hastily began to descend; but, faint_ and weary, scarce
saw his way before him, and dropped full on the back
of the eagle’s mate, jerking out of her clutches a load '
of ﬁsh just caught for her young. Enraged at this loss,
she pursued Phantasmion, and with her strong beak
shattered one of his pinions ere he had time to gain
a cliff towards which he was steering; so that, being
no longer able to direct his course aright, he fell with
violence, i and lay stunned upon the rugged shore.
While he leaned upon his arm, just recovering from
the shock, and surveyed the ocean with dazzled eyes, he
perceived a strange woman’s form rising out of the
waves, and gliding towards the beach: a wreath of
living moving ﬂowers, like sea-anemones, clung round
. her head, from which the slimy locks of whitish blue
hung down till they met the waters; her skin was
thick and glistering; there was a glaze upon it which
made Phantasmion shiver; and, trailing her sinuous
body beside the place where the youth lay, she cast ai
glance towards him, with her moony eyes of yellow green,
at which his blood ran cold: but on she went, and turned
round a crag which jutted into the sea beyond the fallen
prince. Still scarce recovered, Phantasmion arose and
leaned against the lower end of this rock, which, like i
a buttress, projected from the main body of the cliff;
the shattered pinion drooped to the ground, while the
wings on the left side were half-expanded, and lay
languidly against the white stone, like a green branch
amid unseasonable snow. And now other sounds caught
his ear, beside the roar and hiss of advancing and retir-
ing waves. He stood on tiptoe, and looking down into
a recess on the other side of the rock, beheld the shape

that had lately passed him, reclining on the shore, and
staring up in the face of a lofty dame, who talked aloud
with passionate tones and gestures. She whose voice
Phantasmion heard stood with her back towards him;
he saw not her face, but he observed that she wore
purple robes and a jewelled crown. “Ah me i” she
cried, “the beautiful Iarine! Glandreth has called her
‘the beautiful Iarinez’ teach me how to countervail
the charms of this fair girl, and to secure the heart of
Glandreth.” To this the ﬁshy woman made no reply,
save a murmuring sound of laughter; whereat the
crowned lady exclaimed, in a shrill voice, “Remember
thy vow to the king, my father, when he caught thee in
his toils upon the shore." Then the woman-ﬁsh replied,
“ Have I not redeemed that vow? Did I not lend thee
spells to bewitch the heart of Albinian? and is it not
through me that thou art Queen of this Land of Rocks?
Without guerdon I will serve thee no longer.” The
crowned lady put her hands before her face, and groaned
deeply. At length she made answer, “Be satisﬁed,
Seshelma! the babe shall be thine. Help me to re-
movelarine from the sight of Glandreth ; help me to
destroy the hostile house of Magnart, and thou shalt
have thy desire." Then the crowned woman sate down
below the rock, and listened to the words of her whom
she called Seshelma, and the two seemed to be contriv-
ing some plot. Phantasmion could not understand all
that was said, for Seshelma discoursed in a low gurgling
murmur ; but he heard her speak of poisonous ﬁsh, and
of a charmed vessel, and of a damsel named Iarine. In
the en'd she drew from an oyster-shell a glittering net,
and offered it to her companion, who took it from her

ﬂabby hand, then rose, and, lifting up her embroidered
train, went her way leisurely, as if absorbed in thought.
But Seshelma returned into the sea, and, again rowing
past Phantasmion, she looked up in his face with the
same hideous leer which had chilled his blood before;
then diving into the deeper water, she quickly disap-
peared.
Phantasmion stood for some time gazing on the ﬂood,
almost expecting that some new shape would rise out of
it. He mused on what had passed, and could not help
in some sort connecting it with his heavenly dream. A
lady, young and beautiful, was hated and persecuted;
powers of earth and sea were leagued against her. He
‘pictured this fair Iarine with the countenance which he
had beholden in the vision, and longed to ﬁnd her and
rescue her from peril.
The Prince now bethought him that he was a long
way from his royal palace, having fallen on the borders
of Rockland, a country adjoining his own dominions; he
therefore hastened from the coast, holding up the dis-
abled wing with his hand, and journeyed homeward on
foot. After a night’s, sleep, he repaired to the pome-
granate tree, but felt unable to express the imaginations
that haunted his mind while Potentilla stood before him.
He told the fairy, when she begged to know his pleasure,
that he was tired of his butterﬂy pinions, and wished to
try new experiments. “ Make my feet,” said he, “ like
those of ﬂies, which climb up the mirrors or walk over
the roof of my marble hall; enable me to follow wher-
ever one of those insects can steal along." He had no
sooner spoken thus than Potentilla removed the wings
she had given him, and ﬁtted to his feet the suckers of

ﬂies. This gift pleased Phantasmion well, and he spent
the remainder of that day in gliding along the walls and
over the vaulted ceilings of his palace, or scaling ‘the
pillar-like stems of the loftiest palm trees. Those who
witnessed his feats were amazed; but it had been com-
monly believed that the race of the Palmland kings was
under the protection of some mysterious being, and this ’
tale, which had of late years been forgotten, was now
recalled to mind with fresh awe and wonder.

G H A P T E R IV.
PHANTASMION Asonnns THE MOUNT or moms.
EARLY the next morning‘, Phantasmion rode out to
the Black Mountains, which divided his territories from
Rockland, the realm of a neighbouring monarch; and,
having arrived at the bottom of a steep hill, he alighted
in order to climb the side of it. This was a precipice
of solid rock, many hundred feet deep, which looked like
a ‘dark curtain let down from the sky, and till that hour
had never been trodden by the foot of man. Strange
was it to see him as he paused in the midst of the
ascent, plucking a wild ﬂower from a crevice; not sus-
tained in the manner of a bird, with spread tail and half
expanded pinions, but seemingly upborne by his own
lightness, like a vapoury phantom. When the prince
was a child, his mother had told him that a wreath of
precious stones was hidden somewhere betwixt the top
of this huge crag, and the summit of the hill beyond ;
she had hung it round the neck of her pet lamb in play,
and, while she was plucking dainty herbs to regale her
favourite, an eagle had carried away the lamb and its
costly necklace to her young ones among the highest
rocks. Phantasmion remembered this, and, in some
faint hope of discovering the relic, wandered on, after he
had gained the summit of the crag, till he came to a
small round lake, which lay buried in shadow below a

semicircle of rocks. Taking rest here for a few moments,
he spied an eagle with something white in her taluns,
and soon he saw her ﬂy across the pool and enter a recess
amid the crags above. “This is one of those eyries,"
thought he, “ where the eagles breed from age to age ;
I wil! invade their ancient house, and perhaps I may
win back the prize which was plundered from mine.”
While he was beginning to ascend, the mother eagle
ﬂew forth again, so that Phantasmion was able to mark
well the situation of the nest. With steady foot he
climbed the crags above the tarn, till he arrived at the
bottom of that loftier cliff, in the centre of which the
eyry was embosomed; just as he reached this point,
unexpected sounds met his ear: “ The eaglets’ cry is _
strangely like the wailing of a child,” thought he ; and,
full of wonder, he glided up the front of the rock to the
hollow where the nest was lodged, and there beheld an
infant lying on its back unhurt, but screaming piteously,
while two half-ﬂedged eaglets were ' shrinking to the
further part of the cavity, frightened by the clamours of
their intended victim. Startled by this sight, the prince
thought no more about the jewels, but took up the babe,
which was clad in the fairest raiment, and now, having
. something beside himself to carry, was bent on returning
by the easiest path. Accordingly, after having descended
to the tarn again, ‘he tracked the course of a rivulet
which ﬂowed from ‘that darksome receptacle till it
wandered away _out of sight amid shaggy rocks; then,
pausing to consider how he should proceed, again he
heard a sound of lamentation, but it was softer and
deeper than that which had proceeded from the eagle’s
nest. He listened, but the dashing of some hidden

waterfall overpowered the voice, and for a moment he
thought that fancy had deceived him ; till once more it
rose louder than those watery sounds, and then sank into
silence.
Phantasmion wrapped the infant, now fast asleep, in
his 'upper vest, and laid it on dry moss, under a jutting
stone; he then followed the streamlet among the crags,
and thus found his way to a ‘nook, where it formed a
series of cascades. Beside the lowest of these, a damsel
sat weeping. She was so fair and exquisitely formed
that, leaning against the black rock, she looked like
those white ﬁgures that are cut in relief on the dark
ground of an onyx. She was a prisoner amid the
labyrinth of rocks, unable either to repass the precipitous
road whereby she had incautiously ascended, or to climb
the wall of rock which rose above her head, and over
which the prince was airily advancing. A yew tree
grew out of a cleft in the beetling crag', and from its
twisted trunk Phantasmion looked down upon the
damsel, and saw her cheeks wet with tears, and her
'luxuriant tresses curling amid the spray of the
torrent; it seemed as if the waterfall mocked her dis-
_ tress, babbling while she wept bitterly, and cry-
ing, “Fair one, follow me! see how I leap down the
precipice."
The rustling of boughs over-head made the fair girl
look up, and seeing a bright face peering down amid the
dark foliage of the tree, “ Good youth,” she exclaimed,
“ hast thou seen a babe upon this mountain ? Hast
thou seen an eagle carrying a young child to her nest ?”
“ The infant is safe,” replied Phantasmion ; “ I took
him myself even now from the eyry, and he lies wrapped

up in a silken garment under shelter of a rock.” Then
the youth swung himself down from the yew, and ap-
proached the damsel, who, overjoyed at these tidings,
led him to the place where she had climbed up to reach
the waterfall,'thinking that she might ﬁnd the eagle’s
nest within the chasm. Phantasmion offered to carry
her to the bottom of the rock, and to prove with what
ease it could bedone, he darted up and down the steep
cliff before her as ﬁrmly and fearlessly as if he were
skimming over the plain. The lady looked astonished
at his wondrous agility, and was somewhat alarmed
when he carried her in his arms to the edge of the crag ;
but in a few moments he placed her in safety on the
heather below, and hastened back to the jutting stone
where he had left the baby. Phantasmion found the
child still asleep, with the tears yet glistening on its
placid cheek, and soon returned, holding it carefully to
his breast ; the damsel sprang forward to meet him ; her
countenance was no longer downcast, but beaming with
joy and tender affection, and, as she stretched out her
arms _to receive the rescued babe, Phantasmion saw that
her face was the same as that entrancing one which he
had beheld in his dream. He suffered her to take the
child, and gazed in silent ecstasy while she‘was pressing
it to her bosom. At last, after uttering many thanks,
she bade him farewell, and was about to depart ; Phan-
tasmion would have attended her home, but, with earnest
looks and words, she declined his courtesy, and began
winding his way, in all haste, toward the further part of .
the mountain. "The prince followed her with his eye as
she steadily descended a slope of smooth grass, the babe,
now awake, showing its rosy face over her shoulder,

while ‘a gentle breeze uplifted her long wavy locks,
brightened by the sunshine. i
No sooner was she lost from his view, than Phan-
tasmion, awaking from his trance, hastened in the
direction which he had seen her take, and at length’
came in sight of a spreading vale, with a dusky lake in
the centre of it. The damsel was nowhere to be seen;
she had struck into a wood on the skirt of the hill, but,
at the further end of the valley, companies of soldiers
. , clad in mail were exercising themselves in a mock battle ;
they were too distant for the youth to discern their
motions, but, the sun being reﬂected from their polished
armour, a steady mass of lightning seemed to dwell upon
the plain.‘ Phantasmi0n’s soul kindled at the sight, and
he almost longed to run down and join these shining
troops: but from the appearance of the sky he feared
to be belated if he tarried longer, and in order that
he might not miss his way, retraced his steps to the
small round lake on the other side of the moun-
tain. .
_
At the time that he reached the tarn, a beam of
light was resting on these waters, which were covered
with shadows when he saw them last, and through the
clear ﬂuid a gemmy coronal was gleaming. Phantasmion
waded into the pool, and plucked the splendid ornament
from the ooze in which it was half buried; it was of
exquisite workmanship, and represented a pomegranate
branch, the leaves being made of emeralds, and the
blossoms of burning rubies. The inner_ part bore this
inscription in letters of gold: “ The Queen of Palm-
land.”
Phantasmion placed the wreath in his girdle, and

hastened to rejoin his attendants at the bottom of the
hill. The suckers of his feet had imbibed a quantity
of moisture, and being much fatigued, he scarce had
strength to drag his clinging soles from that which they
trode upon : so that he carried away many loose stones
ashe went along, and was in danger of being lamed ere
he reached his horse.
On his way home, Phantasmion showed the wreath,
which had once adorned the ﬂaxen locks of Zalia, to an
ancient noble, formerly his mother’s guardian. The
old man looked sorrowful at the sight of it, and said,
“May the next queen of Palmland be happier than she
who wore those jewels.” “ How sayst thou, Cyradis ?”
the youth replied: “ didst thou not bid me visit the
glades of my mother's native land, when Zalia was the
gayest thing that sported under the green leaves I” “ S0 _
it was with_Zalia,” Cyradis replied, " till she exchanged
' 4 . her wild-ﬂower chaplets for a royal crown. Alas! thy
father saw not how his fair queen was arrayed; he
cared only for his kingdom, and grieved day and night
that he could not aparison his army in solid brass and
steel.” “The King of ' Rockland has well—armed sol-
diers!” exclaimed Phantasmion, recollecting what he
had seen from the mountain top. “ He hath,” replied
Cyradis; “and a great—hearted general too, who seeks
to enlarge the boundaries of Rockland on either side.”
These remarks, and a discourse which followed, made
the son of Dorimant very thoughtful, and he sought next
day to renew his conversation with Cyradis, but was
informed that the ancient chief had returned to his own
abode in the district of Gemmaura, where, in fonner
days, Zalia, the orphan heiress of that territory, dwelt

under the same roof with him. The prince pondered
on the sudden departure of Cyradis, and began to sus-
pect that the good old man had been forced away by
those who wished their youthful sovereign to remain
ignorant and careless of all that pertained to the
government of the realm.

_ CHAPTER v.
PHANTASMION ENTERS THE LAND OF ROCKS.
THE kingdom which Phantasmion had inherited from
his ancestors abounded not only in palms, but in all
kinds of grain and fruit trees, as well as in ﬂocks and
herds. The land ﬂowed with milk and wine, oil and
honey; but few metals or valuable stones had yet been
discovered in its bosom. On the other hand the realm
of Albinian, who reigned over a country separated from
Palmland, partly by an extensive range of hills, called
’ the Black Mountains, and partly by the river Medians,
which ﬂowed from them to the sea on the right hand,
was craggy and barren, rich only in metals, marbles, and
other stones, and in materials for making glass and
porcelain. The men of Rockland (so this ‘wild country
was called), were ingenious in mechanical devices and
operations; the inhabitants of the fertile Land of Palms
were given to agriculture, and had never acquired that
skill in arts and manufactures, by which the neighbour-
ing nation was distinguished. Anciently the two coun-
tries enriched and strengthened one another, but these
friendly relations were exchanged for feuds and settled
hostility during the reign of Dorimant. For that ambi-
tious monarch cherished designs of rendering the Land
of Rocks tributary to his kingdom, and, having been
secretly informed of certain iron mines in a glen among

the Black Mountains, he offered to yield his claim upon
the hand of a fair lady whom Albinian had fallen des-
perately in love with, on condition that this narrow vale
should be annexed to his crown. The king of Rockland
unguardedly accepted these terms, but afterwards refused
to ratify his part of the treaty, having learnt, as he
declared, that Dorimant was covertly preparing to make
war on his dominions. It was reported, however, that
he had been inﬂuenced in this matter by the sorceress
Queen of Tigridia, who foretold that a mighty conqueror
’ should arise in a craggy vale among the Black Moun-
tains containing veins of iron. Dorimant inveighed
loudly against the bad faith of Alhinian, which he secretly
hoped he should soon be in a condition to punish; for,
after deserting the lady to whom he had been betrothed,
he espoused the heiress of Gemmaura, a district which
lay between Palmland and the kingdom of Almaterra,
fully expecting to ﬁnd the desired metals in his new
territory. But a spell seemed cast upon this region from
the hour that it came into his hands, and, though he had
reason to know that both‘ iron and copper had once been
found there, he died without discovering the object of
his search. On his decease, however, the discord which
he had sedulously fomented between his subjects and
their neighbours did not subside; the ﬁrst were very
scantily supplied with instruments of war, and the others
were dependent on the ﬁelds and pastures of a rich
country called Almaterra, for needful sustenance ; but so
enduring was the enmity which the measures of Dori-
mant had excited betwixt the two nations, that no regard
to interest could restore their former friendly intercourse.
Phantasmion revolved these things in his mind after

hearing what fell from Cyradis; Dariel had formerly''
excited his curiosity concerning the Land of Rocks, and
now he resolved to travel through it in disguise,‘ for the '
sake of making observations relative to war, and still
more from a hope of meeting with the lovely maiden
whom he had rescued from her prison among the rocks.
When he presented himself before Potentilla, the fairy
ﬁxed her eyes on his countenance, and saw that there
was more speculation in it than formerly. “ Give me,”
said he, “ the power to travel with great speed; yet, in
such a way, that I may not outwardly appear to be thus
gifted Let me skip like the grasshoppers, and those
insects which can go at one hound many hundred times
their own lengt .” Potentilla touched his thighs with
her wand, and bade him try his new faculty; so Phan-
tasmion gave a spring, and vaulted above a quarter of a
mile, darting over a clump of young palm trees to alight
in a verdant lawn. '
The prince gave out that he was going to travel, and
all the court imagined that he meant to visit Cyradis in
Gemmaura, which he had never entered since the death
of his mother. Before day-break he took horse, and
sallied forth alone, habited after the fashion of Rockland,
the language and customs of which country he had learnt
from his nurse, and also from Dariel. He wore a vest
of purple silk, embroidered with golden vine leaves :
a jewelled girdle encircled his waist, and he exchanged
his tiara for a cap adorned with a single arching feather
of many hues. In his hand he carried a hollow reed of
thin gold, with a serpent twisted round it; the folds of
the snake held gold and jewels, and in the body of the
wand a nutritious conserve was deposited. Thus equipped,

Phantasmion rode forth to the river Mediana, the banks
of which had formerly been fringed with olive-trees even
to the skirts of the hills; now leaﬂess stumps alone were
to be seen by the river-side: the vineyards, which the
prince passed on his way to the boundary stream,
appeared to have been laid waste, for all the plants were
lying on the ground, torn and trampled into the earth ;
and, in the rich pastures, for miles around, not a sheep
or heifer was cropping the tall grass.
On the Rockland side of the stream, at the foot of a
hill which ended the range of the Black Mountains,
was a fortiﬁed town called Lathra. Phantasmion eyed
the lofty walls and turrets and deep moat by which it
was surrounded, and determined to overleap them all
at a bound. He stood upright on the back of his steed,
and impelled himself forward; in a moment he was
shooting over the house-tops, and instantly afterwards
a tremendous crash was in his ears, while fragments,
sharp as glass, were entering into his ﬂesh. The
leaper had come down upon a stand of sumptuous por-
celain exposed for sale ; the owners all stood aghast
while he endeavoured to glide away; but, soon recover-
ing from their amazement, the whole crowd hustled after
him, as a swarm of wasps rushes out indignantly when
a stone has been ﬂung by wanton children into their
pensile nest, and all their delicate architecture has been
crushed in a moment. They hem round the prince, the
ring grows smaller and smaller; still each man waits
for his neighbour to seize the mysterious culprit, and
ere the circle. has closed upon him, Phantasmion has
sprung away, and, having cleared many a lofty ediﬁce,
he is now alighting in another quarter of the town.

To avoid a fresh crowd which began to collect around
him, he slipped into a large building, the door of which
was standing ajar, and found that he had entered an
armoury, the walls being covered with weapons fanci-
fully arranged, and the ﬂoor with piles of bucklers and
breast-plates. The attention of \ the prince was riveted
by a magniﬁcent sword which lay beside a suit of
armour of extraordinary size. The master of the maga-
zine, seeing his inquisitive countenance, told him that
they belonged to Glandreth, who conquered the country
of Tigridia for King Albinian. “ And that large helmet,
surmounted with a white plume, is that to be worn by
the same person ?” the youth inquired. “ That too is
for Glandreth,” replied the keeper of the arms ; “ Queen
Maudra placed those feathers in it with her own hand.
Thou art from court, and must know more of courtly
affairs than I; but it is plain to the whole country
that the conqueror of Trigidia has ruled both the state and
the queen’s heart ever since the king grew decrepit.”
Phantasmion went forth, and, leaving the town,
advanced toward a ﬁeld where men, wild beasts, and
cattle appeared to be strangely mingled together.
Drawing nigh to the scene of action, he perceived that
a band of tigers were performing certain movements on
_ signals given them by men with spears in their hands.
Obedient to the word of command, they surrounded the
sheep and kine, separated them into divisions, and
drove them to diﬂerent parts of the ﬁeld with as much
skill as a shepherd's dog will collect his master’s ﬂock
on the mountains. A country-man was looking on by
the side of Phantasmion. “I hear,” said he, “that
there is little booty to be got now in the tract about

the river; doubtless our captains will march up to King
Phantasmion’s palace next, and see what can be made
prize of there.” “Aha !" cried Phantasmion, much
startled, and ready to give one of his enormous leaps :
he restrained himself, however, and carelessly observed,
“ I knew not that tigers were bred in this land.” The
rustic stared as he replied, ‘‘‘ Sure.thou hast heard how
Malderyl, the queen’s mother, sent them from Tigridia,
where they abound in the brakes and forests '£"
The prince made no reply, but directed his steps
toward a woody knoll, which he espied at a distance;
and, having reached the bottom of it, instead of slowly
winding his way to the ‘top, he gained it at one bound,
and there stretched himself at full length on dry moss
underneath the trees. “ How have I~been living,”
thought he, ' “like an animal in its winter burrow,
wrapped in luxury, without hearing or seeing aught of
what went on around me ; I will spring back, to guard
my palace; nay, I will make war upon Glandreth, and
my numerous army shall cover the battle plain ! Army !
alas! can men armed with slings and cudgels deserve
that name ? No! it is best to pursue my original
intent. I will survey this injurious, this faithless
country, as an eagle eyes the ﬂock on which heimeans
to descend. I will make my way through Almaterra;
Dariel w_as wont to say that a little effort would suﬂice
to snap the ties which bind that state to this. Yes, yes,
I will seek the king and the chiefs of the adjoining
country, and, having gained allies there, I will return
to my own kingdom, and be a monarch indeed."
Instantly after Phantasmion had uttered these last
words to himself, the small cunning eye of .a serpent ‘

met his view; the creature looked in his face as if ‘
divining his very thoughts, while it lay coiled up under
' the fallen leaves of a bay tree. As soon as the prince
raised his head, the snake began to move its forked
tongue, and seemed to emit sparks of ﬁre from its eyes;
whereupon Phantasmion started from his mossy couch,
and, having leaped from the top of the wooded hill to
the plain below, found himself close upon that wide
sheet of water which he had formerly seen from the
craggy mountain, when he followed the steps of the
departing damsel. Toward the banks of this lake» he
swiftly proceeded, and came opposite to a large island . ’
covered with tall trees of gloomy green, over which rose
battlements and pinnacles and frowning towers. The
waters of the lake seemed to be very deep, so dark was
their aspect; and two craggy islets, at nearly equal
distances, emerged from its bosom betwixt the large
island and the shore. Phantasrnion skipped to these
isles ‘of crag, one after another, and looked like some
gay water-bird alighted on\a rock with glistening plum-
age, as he stood on the dusky islet with his arched
feather waving to and fro. From that station he had a
fair view of the large island, and saw that, within its
pebbly margin, there rose a fence of interwoven hollies,
like a jasper colonnade on a white marble pavement.
This ﬁrm bank Phantasmion was just able to attain by
a leap, and no sooner had he gained it than his atten-
tion was arrested by a soft melancholy voice, liquid and
musical as the chime of crystal cups thrilled by a dewy
ﬁnger. He drew nigh the fence, and, though unable to
catch a glimpse of ‘the singer through the close hollies,
he heard these words of the song:

32 P/zantasmion.

‘ _'.‘.' , F“: *-_

Tho’ I be young—ah ! well-a-day!
I cannot love these opening ﬂowers;
For they have each a kindly spray
To shelter them from suns and showers;
But I may pine, oppressed with grief,
Robbed of my dear protecting leaf.
Since thou art gone, my mother sweet,
I weep to see the ﬂedging doves
Close nestling in a happy seat,
Each beside the breast it loves;
While I, uncared for, sink to rest,
Far, far from my fond mother’s breast.
Sweet mother! in thy blessed sight
I too might blossom full and free;
Heaven then would beam with softer light;
But, could I rest upon thy knee
My drooping head, what need I care
How sickly pale and wan I were?
My face I view in pools and brooks,
When garish suns full brightly shine;
Ah! me! think I, those blooming looks,
And that smooth brow can ne’er be mine!
Sad heart! I charge thee to express
More truly all thy deep distress.
Deceitful roses leave my cheek,
Soft lilies join those happy ﬂowers,
Which nothing stirs but zephyr meek,
Which nought oppresses but sweet showers;
While she lies dead I grieve to be
More like those living ﬂowers than she.
Here there was a pause in the soft strain, and
Phantasmion, looking on the lake, descried some ﬁsher-
men in a vessel just come within sight. He eagerly

hailed them, and while they approached the shore, he
heard the song thus continued :— ' ‘
O, what to me are landscapes green,
With groves and vineyards sprinkled o’er,
And gardens where gay plants are seen
To form a daily changing ﬂoor ?
I dream of waters and of waves,
The tide which thy sea-dwelling laves.
Dearly I love the hours of night,
When bashful stars have leave to shine;
For all my visions rise in light,
While sun-lit spectacles decline;
And with those stars they fade away,
Or look as glow-worms look by day.

CHAPTER VI.
PHANTASMION PAYS A SECOND VISIT TO THE KING,S
ISLAND.
PHANTASMION leaped into the boat when it approached
the shore, requesting the ﬁshermen' to convey him to
the further end of the lake; and, while the vessel was
receding, he listened in rapt attention ‘to the music of
that plaintive song which ﬂoated over the water, accom-
panied by the soft symphony of the dipping oars. His
conductors eyed him in silent surprise; and, guessing
that he was a person of condition, they held their peace,
and continued to rowfrom the island. When the melody
was no longer audible, Phantasmion asked an old man
who was sitting at the bottom of the boat, busy with his
tackle, if he knew who it was that sang on the large
wooded island. “Ay, marry!” replied he, “the voice
was that of Iarine, the fair daughter of our king.”
“ Iarine ! ” exclaimed the prince ; “ and dwells Iarine in
yonder castle?" he inquired, pointing to the towers
which were yet visible above the trees in the distance.
“ That is the summer abode of the queen‘ and her aged
consort,” replied the old man. “Is the king aged?"
rejoined Phantasmion. “He looks as if he were,”
answered the ﬁsherman; “ but that comes more of
sickliness than of years. He is feeble in mind and body,
but his wife reigns manfully in his stead, aided by a

valiant general, and other helpers, belike, which to us
are unknown and invisible.” These last words were
spoken in a low tone, and Phantasmion thought of the
crowned lady and her strange companion on the sea-
shore.
“I am a stranger in this land,” observed he, after a
while, “so long have I been absent from it; but, me-
thinks, I recollect that the king had another wife before
he espoused the Princess of Tigridia." “ That beauteous
dame,” said the old man, “perished at sea, leaving the
sweet Iarine to deplore her loss.” “ l:Ias Queen Maudra
children of her own?” the prince inquired. His in-
formant replied, “ she has two; and one of them is still _
a babe in his nurse's arms. This same infant was carried
away by an eagle to its nest, on the highest peak of the
Black Mountains, and the fair princess Iarine climbed up
among the crags, and rescued him from the eyry. She
' had been playing with him in a ﬁeld at the ‘foot of the,
hill, when the ﬁerce bird descended from the rocks to
seize her little charge; and, in the evening, she re-
appeared with the babe in her arms, just as the king's
household began to fear that both were lost for ever.”
The island was now far in the distance, and the
ﬁsherman inquired where the princely stranger desired
to be put on shore. Phantasmion asked the owner of
the boat, if he could aﬂbrd him hospitality for the rest
of that day, and a night's lodging? and the old man
made answer that he was able and willing to do so,
even without the payment which the youth offered.
His younger comrades now impelled the boat swiftly
onward; and, passing a tiny tufted islet, over against
which stood the ﬁsherman’s cottage on a pleasant green

’ bank, the vessel was brought up to a little stone pier
right opposite to the door of that lowly dwelling.
Phantasmion entered the rustic abode, and partook of
the humble fare which it afforded; then went forth
again, having told the ﬁsherman and his dame that he
meant to return and rest under their roof that night.
He wandered along the banks of the lake, directing his
steps toward that part of them whence he could obtain
a full view of the King’s Island. And now the sun
went down, and the lustre of a summer’s day, which
had drowned all things in a ﬂood of hazy brightness,
gave place to the distinct splendour of moonlight, when
the hills looked like masses of ebony, and seemed for
the ﬁrst time to exhibit' their true forms and bulk,
while standing out in bold relief against the deep clear
sky. Phantasmion gazed not on them, but kept looking
towards the island ; for the melancholy strain which he
had lately heard there was yet sounding in his ears, and
connected itself with the fair countenance which was
constantly present to his mind. On the side of the
wooded isle which he now beheld Phantasmion espied
no verdurous wall of interlacing boughs, but a margin
fringed with broad alders and bending willows. While
his eye was ﬁxed on that grove, he saw a small narrow
boat issue from amid the boughs which drooped into
the water, and ﬂit across the lake. It was impelled by
a youthful maiden, whose braided tresses shone in the
moonlight. She entered a little inlet where the water
looked black as pitch, the trees leaning over and hiding
it from the moonbeams. Phantasmion stood in the
shadow of the birchen grove, behind the narrow bay,
and watched her motions. The damsel leaned over the

edge of the boat, and dipped into the dusky basin a net
that seemed to be composed of ﬂaming wires. The
prince expected to see those ﬂames quenched, but they
glowed and ﬂashed in their liquid shrine like ﬁery
water-snakes, illuminating the cove, and making the
moonbeams that rested on the lake beyond appear of a
greenish chrysolite colour. Shoals of little ﬁsh, with
many coloured bodies, were attracted by the light: up
they came, and crowded into the net, so that the maiden
appeared to be catching live ‘ jewels instead of ﬁsh.
When her net was full, the lady poured her draught of
glittering ﬁshes into a silver pitcher of ' water, which
stood on the bench of the boat ready to receive them.
Phantasmion gazed earnestly upon her, and knew that
she was that same fair damsel whom he had met upon
the mountain; but now she appeared more brightly
beautiful than when he found her weeping beside the
rushing cataract. Her face looked placid as marble;
and those features, on which the ruddy light of the
magical net was playing, seemed as if they ought never
to have been cast in perishable clay. Dazzling in white-
ness were the lady’s rounded arms, extended over the
pool; and her graceful neck, on which no jewels shone,
was polished and smooth as alabaster, but with a look of
soft downy depth which art cannot imitate. Her bright
locks no longer ﬂoated to her waist, but were coiled
round the back part of her head; even from her open
brow the ringlets were strained away, and only a few
tendrils, escaping from conﬁnement, lay upon her cheeks
and forehead.
Having ﬁlled her net once more, and loaded her
pitcher, the damsel began to push the boat out of the

cove by means of a long pole. While thus engaged,
she looked up, and espying the ﬁgure of Phantasmion,
as he stood under the birch trees just above the bay,
she started and hastened her movements, then, ﬂinging
down the pole, she seized the oars, and began to row
with all speed toward the island. This was done before
Phantasmion had summoned resolution to speak or stir ;
now she was in the deep water, yet still within the
limits of his vaulting powers, but he restrained himself
from leaping into the lake. A little way further on
was a vessel, which, by some accident, had got loose
from its moorings, and was drifting about in the water;
he leapt into it, and thus nearly upset the narrow skiff,
which quivered with the sudden shock; but, when it
steadied again, he caught up the oars and rowed to the
wooded isle. Having arrived within a certain distance,
he sprang to land among the willows, leaped over an
alder grove, and beheld a maiden at the end of a long
alley of cypresses, bearing on her head the silver
pitcher, the polished surface of which reﬂected the
moonlight. One arm supported the vessel, the other
held aside her long white garments and disclosed her
twinkling feet, brightened by the harmless ﬂames of the
magic net, which was grasped in the same hand that
contained the folds of her light robe. Oh, what grace
of motion was there! The black ﬁrs and cypresses
which stood in the moonshine, stern and grand, like
stony efﬁgies of trees, the delicate acacias that hung
their boughs in graceful attitudes, ready to sway to and
fro on the slightest impulse, all seemed to recognize her
as one of themselves, a being unsullied and perfect in
the simplicity of nature. Something of this Phantas-

mion may have felt, but he thought not of trees or of
moonshine, and knew not whether it were day or
night; he was busily measuring the distance between
himself and the damsel. But even as a silvery beam
from a lamp, which some night passenger carries in his
hand, will travel across the ceiling of an unlighted room,
attracting the eye of one who sits idly musing in the
darkness, so did the damsel gleam, glide, and vanish
through the avenue of black shadows; and Phantas-
mion stood motionless, while swift thoughts were pass-
ing and repassing through his mind. He hesitated to
follow the maiden along the walk which wound circu-
larly about the island, but, espying a light amid the
foliage, he darted through the trees into a smooth lawn,
across which he beheld a tower separate from the main
body of the castle. The lower half of this building was
hidden by shrubs, but, just above the screen, projected
a balcony, over the rails of which a_ lady in sumptuous
‘attire was leaning, and looking eagerly down upon the
path below; a diadem was on her brow, the rich train
of her purple robe swept the marble platform, beads of
gold were twined around her bony arms, while nume-
rous carcanets and chains of sparkling jewels hung from
her neck over the balusters. That lady’s lineaments
were queen-like, though harsh and worn : but hers was
the aspect of no kindly dame, and on such a countenance ’
of ungentle emotion the moon’s calm ray seldom rests.
“Iarine!” she exclaimed, “ hast thou found them?
quicken thy pace!” and now Phantasmion espied the
damsel, with the pitcher on her head, mounting the,
higher steps of the balcony stairs ; a moment afterwards
she was gone, having entered the tower with the

crowned lady; then, the door being closed, and the‘
light of the inner apartment hidden, Phantasmion was‘.
left alone with the trees and the half shrouded moon.’
“That voice, that diadem, that gorgeous train!" ex-
claimed the youth; “ full surelythis is the passionate
dame who sate discoursing with that strange woman of
the deep. They spake of poisonous ﬁsh !—O, can this
maiden, who looks too fair and good to dwell below the
sky, can she be the base instrument of wicked wills?
Nay, nay, she is herself beguiled, perchance to be the
victim of treacherous hatred.” He gazed on the dark
tower, and had resolved to gain admittance by force or
stratagem, when a ﬁle of armed men advanced through
the trees into the lawn, talking loud and peering about, '
as if in search of some one. From a few words which
came to his ear, Phantasmion guessed that he had been
descried from the castle, and that the guard were come
to lay hands on him. He glided off amid the trees,
while the clouds were veiling the moon’s light, and
found his way, by the margin of the isle, to that same
spot which he had visited in the morning ; from the bank
of pebbles he bounded to the ﬁrst of the craggyislets,
thence to the second, and from that again to the shore
of the mainland. .
,
The moon was driving off her veil when Phantasmion
thus crossed the water; and, when he stood on the
shore, having the woody knoll right before him, she
had thrown it completely aside. The prince resolved
on returning to the ﬁsherman’s hut by the side of the
- lake 'opposite to that which he had lately traversed, so
that he should have gone completely round the
whole sheet of water by the time that he reached

the cottage, which from its situation he felt sure of
recognizing.
He skirted the lake closely, being obliged now and
then to leap over parts of the shore which it would have
been troublesome to pass step by step, and in this way
he came to a river, which he concluded was on its way
to join the sea upon the right hand. The stream was
wide where it issued out of the lake, and looked deep
and turbid. Phantasmion prepared to spring across, but
checked himself and paused for a few moments, survey-
ing the opposite bank, and endeavouring to ascertain its
nature. While standing thus on the river’s brim, he
felt something cold and slimy touching his foot between
the straps of the sandals, and soon a slippery hand glided
up his leg where it was bare, the tight vest having been
rent by thorns during his journey. Phantasmion had
no time to consider what this might be, for the touch
was as that of a torpedo, and he had received an electri-
cal shock which benumbed his whole body. While he
stood stupiﬁed and motionless, again he felt the terrible
hand grasping his leg, and attempting to drag him into
the river. Then, throwing down the serpent wand, he
hastily drew his sword, and smote that which was pulling
at his leg ; whereupon a hissing sound, such as a snake
might send forth when crushed by a stone, issued from
the water, which was tinged for a moment with blood.
Phantasmion looked down and beheld the ﬂat white face
of the ﬁshy woman, Seshelma, glistening in the moon-
light; she leaned backward in the tide as if she were
faint with pain, and her great glassy eyes appeared ﬁxed
and rigid; but, when they stared on him that had in-
ﬂicted the wound, they seemed to express more of slow

malice than of any keen sensation. Soon, however, she
gathered strength, and turning about began to dive away
into the deeper water. Phantasmion seized her blue
locks, but they slipped out of his hand, while the air
was ‘ﬁlled with cries of menace or of mockery, and
numberless grotesque visages, starting out of water,
gleamed momently in the twilight. The prince staggered
and fell, for he had received another severe shock; from
which having at length recovered, he saw nothing but
the image of the moon’s face on the stream, and heard
no sound but the soft ‘full murmur of an unimpeded
current, smoothly sweeping by.

CHAPTER VII.
AFTER. PASSING THE NIGHT IN A THICKET, PHANTASMION
TALKS WITH TELZA, THE NURSE OF IARINE.
FOR some time after he had grasped the locks of Ses-
helma, Phantasmion felt as if his limbs were frozen;
and, on attempting once more to spring across the river,
he found that his leaping powers were suspended. No
boat was at hand or to be seen within hail; he dared
not trust himself in the waters of that haunted stream,
but, feeling desirous of rest, he resolved to make his bed
for the remainder of the night in a grove of oaks and
beeches, a little way removed from the borders of the
lake and river. On arriving in this thicket he seemed
to have entered a dim chamber, so close and leafy were
the boughs that composed it ; and the moss on which he
reclined, beneath the boughs of an oak, made an easy
couch ; but no sooner had he laid down than he seemed
to hear the hum of a spinning-wheel, turned by some
one in the dark; and the importunate bird, which pro-
duced that sound from her gaping throat, kept ﬂying
round his head and striking her wings together sonor-
ously. After persevering in this course for some time,
she would perch on a bough just above the prince’s head,
and utter two or three short sharp notes, as though a
thorn were piercing her bosom. It was in vain to scare
the bird away, for she still returned, and at last, in spite

of her noise and restlessness, Phantasmion fell half asleep,
and thus reposed till he was completely awakened by a
still more impetuous clapping of pinions, and a vehement
whistling close to his face. The youth arose, and, by a
glimmer of the moon’s light, which pierced the branchy
covert, he descried a glistering snake, and the speckled
night-jar, with her great bill wide open, pouring out her
angry murmur over the silent reptile’s head. He drew
the sword from his girdle and cut the serpent in pieces;
then, stooping down to examine its severed head, he
espied a nest in a little hollow betwixt the roots of the
oak tree, and thus discovered the cause of that poor
bird’s uneasiness. For she had ﬁrst been driven from
her nest by Phantasmion’s approach, and was afterwards
in trepidation at the appearance of the reptile. She
imagined indeed that it came to suck her unprotected
eggs, while the prince believed it to be some emissary of
Seshelma, who seemed bent on procuring his death or
driving him out of Rockland ; and, when he had looked
at the several pieces of the dead snake in a fuller light,
and saw that it closely resembled that which prepared
to attack him in the woody knoll, this opinion was
strengthened.
The youth advanced a little further in the wood to
climb a beech tree; and, when the night-jar was settled
on her nest, he had stretched himself along one of its
wide, ﬂat boughs, the upper ones forming a canopy over
his head. Here he slept till 'break of day, and was then
roused by the twittering of birds all around him: when
he ﬁrst entered the grove it seemed to have no other
inhabitants than the disturbed mother and himself; but
now every tree was alive with chirping voices and mov-

ing pinions. Phantasmion was little inclined to join the
vocal choir, being ill at ease in his whole frame; he felt
so anxious indeed concerning his bodily condition, that
he must needs climb further up the tree to make trial of
his strength, and found it in some degree restored.
From the top of the tall beech he cast his eyes over the
lake, which wore a uniform colouring of sad blue, while
motionless bars of grey cloud streaked the horizon, and
all the landscape was revealed under a cold equalizing
light. The youth at that hour felt a transitory des-
pondence, and his beautiful visions seemed to have de-
parted with the sublime shadows and spiritual splendour
of midnight.
From his lofty station Phantasmion beheld the ﬁsher-
man in his boat, and hailed him with a shout that woke
the echoes, at the same time beckoning with his serpent
wand. Well pleased was the old man to hear that saluta-
tion, having come out thus early in search of his guest, for
whose safety he had begun to entertain some fear. The
prince descended from the tree, and, repairing to. the
boat, which was soonbrought to land, he seated himself
at the stern, and requested to be conveyed to the cottage.
He told his ancient host that he had been seized with
cramp, and, feeling still much disordered, should be glad
to remain under his roof till he should ﬁnd himself
in a condition to resume his journey. The old man
renewed his former hospitable offers, and, rowing faster
than he had done for many a day, quickly brought the
vessel to the little stone pier. Passing the greensward,
now wet with morning dew, Phantasmion entered the
cottage, and was kindly welcomed by Telza, the ﬁsher-
man’s ancient dame who had stood on the landing-place,

straining her eyes to ascertain whether the noble.
youth were with her husband, and as soon as she dis-
cerned him‘ in the boat, had hastened within to prepare
for his reception! ’ Phantasmion was refreshed with the
food which she set before him, and, happening to ﬁx his
eye on the porcelain vessels in which it was served, was
told they were the gift of the princess Iarine, to whom
Telza had been a fond and faithful nurse. No sooner
was that subject opened, than the good old woman had
more to say than she had time to utter, and the prince
felt no desire to stir from her side while she enlarged on
the charms of Iarine's babyhood. “ In very truth,” said
she, “ I was the luckiest nurse that ever rocked a cradle;
and little need was there to rock the cradle of sweet
Iarine. O! she would sleep so beautifully for hours
together, without a start or a murmur, yet looking as
lifesome all the while as that clear lake, which never
seems so bright as when it sleeps in the sunshine! Then
when it was her time to awake, in a moment she was
full of smiles, her pretty eyes wide open suddenly, and
sparkling like the little merry rivulets which never sleep
at all. We thought she could not be meant to pass
through this vale of tears, because she wept so little at
the beginning of her pilgrimage; but now I fear she
weeps enough, and more sadly and stealthily than she
need ever have done in my arms.” “Is it not several
years since she lost her mother ?” inquired the youth.
“ To me’ it seems but yesterday,” Telza replied ; “ but
to one so young as Iarine, the tinie must appear full
long, and the loss might ere now have been forgotten,
had it been kindly repaired.” How did Queen Anthem-
mina meet her death ?” said Phantasmion. “ She

perished at sea,” was the answer, “ in sailing to the Isle
of Birds, where a gay entertainment was appointed to be
held. I cannot tell thee all the rumours that were
aﬂoat at the time; but now I verily believe that evil
spirits lent their aid in drowning that lady, for, since
she sank beneath the waves, they, and they only, have
ruled this land.” “Was the ﬁrst queen beautiful?”
asked the prince. “O what could be more beautiful,”
exclaimed Telza, “unless it be her most fair child
Iarine? I have her now before me, just as she appeared
on the day of that ill-starred expedition. Her gleaming
jetty tresses were bound with pearls; alas! she little
thought how soon those pearls would be restored to the
deep! and, wreathed around her snowy-white vest, was
a garland of blue lilies fresh gathered from the lake.
How well I remember the splendid lady raising her eyes
to the ‘child in my arms ! ‘ My pretty one,’ said she,
‘ are they not beautiful?’ and she pointed to those starry
'ﬂowers. Beautiful indeed were her blue eyes beneath
black eyebrows ; but soon they swam in tears, as if at
that moment she had a presage of her doom. The
sweet child had no presentiment ; she laughed and hid
her face behind me as I set her on the ﬂoor, though
charmed to see her mother’s festal ornaments; and O !
how mirthfully she laughed again, when, lifting up a
loose part of the lady’s robe, she spied a silver vessel
hanging by a silken cord !” Telza would have pro-
ceeded much longer in this strain, but the ﬁsherman
beckoned her away, and she left the cottage ; whereupon _
Phantasmion stepped out of ;doors, and gazed upon the

sod came close down to the edge of the water : and now
that the sun shone brightly, the greensward and its
reﬂection seemed all one piece. But soon that picture
began to be ﬁlled with ﬁgures, which, emerging from a
coppice, stole into the verdant foreground, while no steps
were heard upon the noiseless turf. Palfreys, with
courtly riders, were occupying the green space, and the
_mirror showed that one of them carried a silver vessel.
Phantasmion looked up and saw that Telza had now
joined the distant group, and that she was standing
beside a lady who leaned forward on her steed to speak
with her. In a few moments the train were winding
through the coppice, while the ﬁshei'man’s dame, smiling
cheerfully, crossed the greensward and approached her
guest, who was still sitting on the pier ! “O that thou
hadst seen my fair princess !" she cried. “ The morning
air has decked her cheeks with dazzling roses, and now
she looks as lightsome as when she was my nurseling,
and had never shed a tear.” The face of the young
prince grew deeply red at these words of Telza; and
when she added, “ The sweet lady is going to visit her
mother’s sister, the wife of Magnart, in Almaterr_a,” he
started from his seat and eagerly inquired what had
become of the ﬁsherman? “He is going to the King's
island,” replied the dame ; and she pointed to his boat,
which was yet within sight. Then the youth sate down
upon the pier to watch for his return, and Telza seated
herself by his side, hoping in the mean time to have
him for a listener. ‘
Looking at the island, which was just visible in the
distance, she said in a low voice, “ All the country be-
lieves that Albinian was bewitched when he wedded the

daughter of Malderyl, whom Glandreth brought a captive
from Tigridia. Scarce a month of that marriage had
elapsed when the king fell into decrepitude, and Gland- .
reth became the real sovereign of the land. My husband
oft compares Queen Maudra to those evil spirits that
allure men ﬁrst and put them in bail afterwards.”
“ There is a little boy in the boat with thy helpmate,”
cried Phantasmion, when at last he beheld the ﬁsherman
coming from the island “ Yes,” replied Telza, “ that is
Albinet, the king’s eldest son. Iarine grieves to part.

he is guiding the rod which the young prince holds. iim
his hand! Ah ! now a ﬁsh comes out of the water, and!
poor Albinet fancies that he has caught it. How quietly
the good old man drew his hand away, and left the rod
and line, and the prize at the end of it, in the young
one’s possession!” “But the boy is lame!” cried the
prince; “what strange motions he makes in trying to
leap for joy!” “ Till he was four years old,” cried
Telza, mournfully, “that child throve and grew like
mown grass after the rain. One evening he played
alone by the lake side, and from that hour he has been
palsied and sickly, Home he came, looking all aghast,
like one that had seen a spirit ; and verily I believe that
he met with something more than the damp air and
biting gales of the season.”

PHANTASMION IS GUIDED BY THE FISHERMAN TO
POLYANTHIDA. .
PHANTASMION was glad when he saw young Albinet
lifted into a boat which was sent to take him back to
the island; and he loudly hailed the kind old man, who
attended to his summons, and was soon standing beside
him on the stone pier. “ My good host,” cried the
youth, “ canst thou conduct me to the house of Magnart
in Almaterra?” “' That I can, right easily,” the ﬁsher-
man replied. “ I oft go thither to sell ﬁsh ; for we have
a delicate sort in our lake which is found nowhere else,
and the women of these parts have a choice method of
preserving them with spices.” “It is well,” replied the
youth; “I feel myself able to pursue my journey this
very hour, and am desirous to reach the place, I told
thee of by the nearest road.” “The nearest road,” re-
plied the old man, “is a rugged one; it lies among the
Black Mountains; but it would bring thee to Almaterra
some time before they who are winding through the
plain will reach it." The prince was glad to become
acquainted with the passes of the country; and still
more he exulted in the hope of being speedily brought
to the presence of the island princess. “Find me a
good mule,” cried he, “ which cares not forrough ways ;
and as well as he plays his part shall I play mine.”

Before the sun began to slant down his westerly path,
Phantasmion and his ancient guide, seated on mules as
sure-footed as rock-goats, but far more discreet and seri-
ous, were ascending a zig-zag road along a ridge_ of the
Black Mountains. Telza had furnished them with pro-
visions ; the beasts knew everystep of the journey even
better than the guide; and thus the travellers wound
their way for several days over the sides of hills and
through bleak valleys, resting at night under the brow
of a rock, or in the scanty shelter of weather-beaten
pine trees. .
At last they reached a deep gully, where the moun-
tains reared their black fronts on either side, abrupt and
steep, as if the double range had formerly been one, and
had been split asunder by lightning. The blue sky
formed a bright roof to these grim walls, which the sun
vainly strove to illumine, and was the only sight that
relieved the eye from sameness of gloom, except a
rivulet which laboured along the bottom of the glen,
moaning audibly in the summer silence, its weak voice
intercepted by no sound of beast, or bird, or busy insect.
“ Yon falcon comes from Palmland," observed the guide.
“See where she ﬂies over the crags on the left hand.
Doubtless her nest is hid among those airy battlements.”
“ A wise bird !” cried the youth. “ She keeps on the
borders of a plentiful land, yet rears her young securely
in a barren desert. This glen will be an utter solitude
when we have left it.” His comrade smiled as he
answered, “Thinkest thou that we have no living
neighbours but the falcon and her brood '4’ Then come
this way.” Curious to know the meaning of the old
n1an’s smile, Phantasmion followed him to the edge of a

pit, the black mouth of which he had taken for the
shadow of rocks, and heard a noise as he approached
like thunder imprisoned beneath his feet. The calm
looks of his guide assured him that no earthquake
was coming on ; and, lying down, so as to bring his ear
over the darksome gulf, he began to distinguish loud
laments in divers languages, wicked words and piercing
outcries, shouts of anger, accents of woe, and, mingled
with tyrannical voices, the resonance of blows, the clank
of chains, and the crashing of rocks—all these noises
reverberated a hundred fold through the windings of the
subterranean abode, and composed a whirlwind of sounds
which smote the listener’s ear with horror as it rolled
upwards through the black abyss. “What place of
torture is here ?” exclaimed the youth, retreating from
the chasm. “This is the famous iron mine,” his guide
made answer ; “ the same that caused such feuds between
our king and his ancient ally. Glandreth discovered
what riches these rocks contained while following his
father’s stray goats up the glen. F orthwith he stole
across the hills into Palmland, and sold his secret to
king Dorimant. This, and nought but this, was the
foundation of his grandeur. Now he uses the mine
both as a place of punishment and of safe custody:
hither he sends his captives from foreign lands, all
public malefactors, and all of every age and sex and
rank who trespass against his lawless will.” Phantas-
mion proceeded somewhat thoughtfully; but ere long
he had ceased to think of Glandreth, how he began, or
how he maintained his fortunes, and was musing on the
bright lady Anthemmina, whom Dorimant had aban-
doned for the sake of this bleak vale, and whose wrongs

. he resented the more from having unconsciously clothed
her with the form and countenance of Iarine.
The travellers continued to follow the stony path, and,
on emerging at last from the mountain gorge, surveyed
a prospect as little like the savage wilderness that had
brought them to it, as the young monarch’s dream of
love and joy resembled the warlike projects by which he
hoped to realize that soft and radiant vision. Turning
round a broad rock they beheld the vale of Polyanthida,
vested in sunny green, luxuriant with orange groves,
meadows of golden bloom and sloping gardens, whence
the rainbow might have borrowed all its colours. From
the high ground where the travellers stood, they looked
down upon a bright blue lake, partly girt by hills of
soft wavy outline, clad in freshest verdure, to which an
amethystine tinge was imparted by blossoms of the
fragrant thyme. The skirts of these grassy hills were
bathed by the water, while on the opposite side was a
thick wood, stretching beyond the rocky shores, which
looked as if they had been carved by a graver’s chisel,
and formed bays and promontories overhung, here and
there, with knots of drooping trees. The Well attired
valley seemed to smile on the lake, which smiled
radiantly in return, as a conscious beauty, beaming on
her lover, causes his face to brighten with pleasure and
hope. The little brook, too, which had murmured so
fretfully in the darksome pass, now gushed with a wider
stream, arrayed in sparkling white, and bounded to the
lake, raising a gladsome cry as if of thankfulness at
having escaped from those torturing rocks and that
dreary prison. “ Where is the mansion of Magnart? ”
inquired Phantasmion, charmed by the view of this

delicious region. “Beyond that wood it rises,” replied
the ﬁsherman; “verily, thou wilt ﬁnd it as rich and
noble a tenement as ever a groping miner found his
way to. Time was when Magnart and Glandreth dwelt
_with their father in a lowlier hut than mine.” “And
how did they reach the height where we now see them?"
asked Phantasmion. “Have I not told thee of the
mine 1” replied the ﬁsherman. “ Had they no natural
gifts then 1 " inquired the youth ; “did the mine supply
hands as well as materials?" “Gifts ! " cried the old
man, warmly; “ what need they natural gifts who have
supernatural helpmates? moreover, they never scrupled
to blast anything that stood in their way, and now I
believe they would blast each other if the power
answered to the will.” Discoursing thus, the youthful
king and his guide pursued their way down the slanting
path into the ﬂowery vestibule of Almaterra, and soon
struck into the wood which lay between the lake and
the dwelling of Magnart. They had not proceeded far
in the woodland path when Phantasmion stopped short,
listening to a voice which struck him as having some
resemblance to that of Iarine; and looking down the
wood he descried a graceful maiden throwing garlands
around the neck of a white stag. At this sight the
youth leaped from his mule, turned his glowing face to
the old man, and hastily thanked him for his services,
at the same time that he put into his girdle a handful of
gold. “O, thou hast overpaid me! ” cried the ﬁsher-
man; “but shall I not guide thee to the goodly man-
sion ?” “ No !” said the prince: “ only take charge of
my mule, and return when thou wilt.to the Black Lake,
bearing a kind remembrance from me to thy good dame.”

The prince added a jewel for Telza to the gold already
given to his guide, who, having by this time spied a lady
in the wood, and thus gained a twilight glimpse of the
youth’s mind, bade him farewell, and proceeded to a
neighbouring village.
Phantasmion advanced into the forest, and, looking
from behind an oak tree, beheld the slender damsel
caressing the stag, whose white hide was dappled with
minute shadows from a branch of aspen, the sunbeams
ﬁnding their way through the interstices of its delicate
foliage. The lady had intermitted her melody, but now
resumed it, addressing thus her happy comrade, who
seemed to be conscious he was the subject of the
strain :— .
Sylvan stag, securely play,
’Tis the sportful month of May,
Till her music dies away
Fear no huntsman’s hollo;
While the cowslip nods her head,
While the fragrant blooms are shed
O’er the turf which thou dost tread,
None thy traces follow.
In the odours wafted round,
Those that breathe from thee are drowned;
Echo voices not a sound,
Fleet one, to dismay thee;
On the budding beeches browse,
None shall come the deer to rouse;
Scattered leaves and broken boughs v
Shall not now betray thee.
Sylvan deer, on branches fed,
’Mid the countless branches bred,
Mimic branches on thy head
With the rest are springing;

Smooth them on the russet bark,
Or the stem of cypress dark,
From whose top the woodland lark
Soars to heaven singing.
Here a livelier voice from another quarter of the forest,
where the ground dipped into a dell, took up the strain
and continued the song thus, as if in a spirit of gay
mimicry :—
Bound along, or else be still,
Sportive roebuck, at thy will ;
Wilding rose and woodbine ﬁll
All the grove with sweetness,
Safely may thy gentle roe
O’er the piny hillocks go,
Every white-robed torrent’s ﬂow
Rivalling in ﬂeetness.
Peaceful breaks for thee the dawn,
While thou lead’st thy skipping fawn,
Gentle hind, across the lawn
In the forest spreading;
Morn appears in sober vest,
Nor hath eve in roses drest,
By her purple hues exprest
Aught of thy blood-shedding.
The damsel was by this time seated on the projecting
roots of a large tree, ﬁnishing a long wreath of ﬂowers,
while the stag lay beside her and seemed to watch her
motions.
in unison with the voice which proceeded from the dell,
and which was joined by one of deeper tone, in these
latter verses :—
She continued to murmur in a low key, but
Milk-white doe, ’tis but the breeze
Rustling in the alder trees;
Slumber thou while honey-bees
Lull thee with their humming;

G'uz'a'ea' to Polyant/zida. 57
Though the ringdove’s plaintive moan
Seem to tell of pleasure ﬂown,
On thy couch with blossoms sown,
Fear no peril coming.
Thou amid the lilies laid,
Seem’st in lily vest array’d
Fann’d by gales which they have made
Sweet with their perfuming;
Primrose tufts impearl’d with dew;
Bells which heav’n has steep’d in blue
Lend the breeze their odours too,
All around thee blooming.
None shall come to scare thy dreams,
Save perchance the playful gleams;
Wake to quaif the cooling streams
Of the sunlit river;
Thou across the faithless tide
Needest not for safety glide,
Nor thy panting bosom hide
Where the grasses shiver.
When the joyous months are past,
Roses pine in autumn’s blast,
When theviolets breathe their last,
. All that’s sweet is ﬂying :
Then the sylvan deer must ﬂy,
’Mid the scatter-’d blossoms lie,
Fall with falling leaves and die
When the ﬂow’rs are dying.
But now the damsel seated under the tree arose, and
began tripping towards the lake; as she went on she
caught a glimpse of Phantasmion’s ﬁgure among the
trees, and sportively ﬂung the stalks of ﬂowers from
her basket toward the place where he stood, crying
aloud, “ Come, brother, quit thy melancholy humour!

thou wilt not lean all day against that gnarled oak
when fair Iarine is seen amongst us.” These words,
and the countenance of the speaker, dissipated the
illusion which had made Phantasmion’s heart beat so
tumultuously. Fair and sweet was that youthful
maiden, but only so far like Iarine as the wild bloom
of eglantine, dancing in every gale, resembles the
splendid rose of a hundred petals. She took her way
to a brake which was close beside the water, and Phan-
tasmion resolved to follow her; for he surmised that
she was one of Magnart’s fair daughters, of whom Telza
had spoken to him, and that by her he might be plea-
santly introduced to the chief's household. Moving
toward the brake he beheld the lady stoop down to
gather marigolds, which grew far beneath the brambles,
and he saw, what she could not see, a panther masked
by those briars. The beast had now advanced one
paw from behind the bush, and was touching the earth
with his white bosom, about to spring on the stag,
which seemed aware of its danger, as it stood between
the panther and the unconscious fair one. That sight
restored Phantasmion to all his former agility; from
the place where he stood he leaped close up to the face
of the glaring beast, which bounded back into the
forest, and was out of sight ere the prince could draw
his sword to despatch its After vainly pursuing it to
some distance, he returned to the brake, and saw the
slender maiden lying in a swoon beside the brambles ;
her ﬂaxen hair was caught among the thorns; the
basket of ﬂowers lay overturned upon the sod, and one
crimson blossom rested beside her colourless cheek.
The gentle stag was standing beside her, looking down

lovingly on her wan countenance, while the gay garlands
yet hung from his neck.
Phantasmion scooped water from the lake and
sprinkled it upon her cheeks and brow. While he
knelt beside her she revived, and blushed on behold-
ing the bright countenance that bent over hers. She
withdrew her eyes from his face, and they rested on a
blue scarf, which was bound across his breast, and
peeped from beneath his upper garment as he leaned
forward. “ Didst thou know Dariel of Palmland ?” she
inquired, looking earnestly at the ﬁgures embroidered
on the scarf. “He was my dearest friend,” replied
Phantasmion. “And did he give thee that silken
band ?” asked the damsel fearfully. "‘ Alas !” cried
the youth, “ I took it from my Dariel’s corse, and now
am wearing it for his beloved sake,” The lady closed
her eyes and would have fallen to the ground, but Phan-
tasmion’s extended arms received her, and, on recover-
ing, she led the way to that hollow glade whence the
two voices that chimed in with her sylvan song had pro-
ceeded.
The fair damsel advanced before the prince, who,
on entering the shady dell, espied another beauteous
maiden seated on the bank, with her eyes cast down
upon a picture that lay in her lap, while a slender
youth was twining a chaplet of dewy lilies of the vale
amid her raven tresses. “ Leucoia !’.’ cried the maid,
when she heard the rustle of leaves, but still without
raising her eyes from the picture, “ see what a lovely
wreath our Karadan has been making, though not with-
out my aid ; he now vouchsafes to try it upon me, but
I fear it will have lost its freshness ere Iarine comes to

wear it.” The youth had by this time dropped the
chaplet on the ground, and was gazing with a bashful
air on his sister’s companion. And now the dark-
haired lady caught sight of Phantasmion, and springing
from her seat, came gaily forward, while the picture fell
amid a heap of ﬂowers. “ My sister!” she exclaimed,
“ what has detained thee ?” and so saying she cast a
hasty look, with her bright black eyes, at the stranger.
—“ Zelneth,” replied the damsel, “ but for this noble
youth I might never have returned at all ;” and then
she related how Phantasmion had driven away the
panther. On hearing this tale the sprightly maiden
melted into tears, and Karadan, forgetting his reserve,
exclaimed, “ Would that I had been with thee, dear
Leucoia ! ‘I thought I had slain the last panther which
lurked in the forest.”
Phantasmion looked somewhat sternly on him who
had been preparing a chaplet for the island maid ; and
Karadan appeared little delighted when the princely
stranger, who called himself Semiro, a friend of their
former guest Dariel, declared that he was bound for the
house of Magnart. But Zelnetli smiled blithely, her
eyes yet glittering with tears, and thus she spoke:
“ The house of Magnart is the house of our father, and
Karadan will guide thee to it, kind Semiro. Come,
dearest Leucoia, what will our mother say when she
hears of thy jeopardy? Thou art as delicate and as
dearly prized as the frail bloom of wind ﬂowers, which
the ﬁrst eager gale scatters abroad.”
Then the fair maidens arm in arm proceeded to their
stately home, and the stag was left browsing amid a herd
of deer. Phantasmion followed them along the varied

scenes of a wide pleasure-ground, and was conducted by
Karadan to a splendid apartment, where a man of digni-
ﬁed aspect reclined on a sofa. This comely personage
wore a head-dress adorned with jewels, and a superb
scarf thrown over a pelisse composed of feather down,
which gleamed with bright reﬂections, changing accord-
ing to the play of light. The chief rose from his couch
and courteously received the youth of noble demeanour,
who was presented by his son. Karadan then hastily
departed : a pang of jealous fear shot across the heart of
Phantasmion as he quitted the apartment, but the ex-
pectant face of Magnart recalled his wandering thoughts,
and all his warlike plan was once more brought to mind.
With graceful gesture and ﬂowing utterance he had soon
told his story, professing that he was an envoy from
Palmland, had travelled in disguise through the land of
Rocks, and was sent to learn whether his sovereign might
hope for aid from the kings and chiefs of Almaterra,
should his country be invaded by its hostile neighbours.
The countenance of Magnart brightened as Phantasmion
spoke, and he received the tale exactly as it was told
him, being apt to take all things which bore the image
and superscription of his reigning desire, without a
scrutiny. “ Thy master’s foes,” cried he, “ should be
friends of mine ; myself and Albinian married two
daughters of Oleoras, son of Thalimer, and that king's
mighty general is mine own brother. Nevertheless, I
will not uphold Glandreth in his over-weening ambition:
if he invades Palmland he shall have to encounter me,
and I will speak on thy master’s behalf with the heads
of this realm.” It was plain that not ambition displeased
Magnart, but the success which that of a rival had met

with. “ Glandreth invaded Tigridia,” said he, “ on a
mere pretext ; and now, forsooth, he is puffed up with
his conquest, and must give law to all the world. He
threatens me deughtily, because I keep fast hold of
Polyanthida in my wife's right Wh0 denies that one
half was Anthemmina’s portion? Ill befall them that
put away the mother, and would rob the daughter of
her inheritance ! Safely will I guard it f0r that precious
child till I can marry her to my eldest son.”
Phantasmion was more startled by these last words
than if they had proclaimed designs upon the Land of
Palms; and Magnart, seeing the youth’s darkened
brow, began to protest that this marriage would make
no change in his policy, and that Karadan would not
fail to oppose any injustice which might be carried on
in the name of his wife's father. But all his smooth
words were as drops of hot lead to the feelings of _ his
heater, and, while the chief swore that he would leave
no stone unturned to annul the alliance between Alma-
terra and the Land of Rooks, Phantasmion thought of
nothing but how to prevent that between Iarine and
Karadan. For this cause he thankfully accepted Mag--
nart’s invitation to pass that night under his roof. “ We
have not quite settled the matter yet," said the self-
pleasing noble, as he led his guest to another apartment,
there to repose till supper time. “ Now Heaven forbid,”
thought Phantasmion, “that it be settled according to
thy scheme! Could I but see the minds bf the other
parties—in this hope I tarry here.” Having donned fresh
' robes he lay upon a sofa near an open door, that led
into the garden, and, musing On What his h0St had let
fall, watched the shades of evening sadden the landscape,

while nightingales saluted her approach with varied
song; till after a time, this strain, breathed forth more
earnestly than theirs, was borne upon the breeze :
One face alone, one face alone,
These eyes require;
But, when that longed-for sight is shown,
What fatal ﬁre
Shoots through my veins a keen and liquid ﬂame,
That melts each ﬁbre of my wasting frame
One voice alone, one voice alone,
I pine to hear-;
But, when its meek melliﬂuous tone
Usurps mine ear,
Those slavish chains about my soul arewound,
Which ne’er, till death itself, can be unbound.
One gentle hand, one gentle hand,
I fain would hold ;
But, when it seems at my command,
My own grows cold;
Then low to earth I bend in sickly swoon,
Like lilies drooping ’mid the blaze of noon.
The song ceased, but Phantasmion heard not the
nightingales which still warbled in chorus. “ The voice
of Karadan,” thought he, “a passionate rival! but sure
that was no happy strain. He is gone; perhaps even
now by her side. O what vantage ground he has !”
Impelled by this agitating surmise, he advanced towards
the other door, and met one who summoned him to
Magnart’s board.
He followed the messenger, and entering the sump-
tuous hall, surveyed a spectacle which would have
chased all former visions from many a youthful mind.

64 P/zantasmion.
A pyramid of ﬂame suspended from the roof drew out
the deepest glow of crimson hangings, and they, in turn,
cast rosy splendour on white marble pillars, images, and
rich utensils, glittering all around : while over-head the
lofty ceiling so vividly portrayed heaven’s vault, that it
seemed as if the buoyant forms that ﬂoated there, look-
ing translucent amid golden ether, and spurning the
clouds with their feet, were soon to vanish in the skyey
depth. From the hand of one a posy was falling back
to earth, and the scattered ﬂowers, which caught the
light as they descended, shone like meteors. In the
centre of the hall stood a table covered with fruits,
wines, and viands, contained in vessels of crystal and
gold, among which was a taller one of silver. Arzene,
the wife of Magnartfwas seated at the board, apparelled
as beseemed her queenly ﬁgure, which time had ripened
into a new aspect of comeliness ere it had lost all the
graces of youth. Zelneth sate next, with one full arm
resting on the table, while the other held a chaplet of
faded lily bells, which she was displaying to her mother
when Phantasmion entered the hall. No tresses drooped
over her cheek of rich carnation, or veiled the brilliance
of her large and liquid eyes, but the raven hair that
loosely waved around her head rested on the white
expanse below in massy curls, like the volutes of a
pillar, and, descending below the gilded cincture’s deep
recess, wandered along the falls and risings of her soft
luxuriant form. Leucoia’s ﬁgure, easy and graceful as
the sapling ash, was seen bending over her mother’s
chair: her quiet eyes, gleaming through a shower of
light ringlets, were ﬁxed on the countenance of Zelneth,
and one staid smile responded to the quick motions of

her sister-’s face, which was incessantly rippling and
sparkling beneath the breeze of mirthful fancy.
Karadan stood on the other side of Arzene, with his
countenance turned away from the table : he held in his
hand a javelin, and pretended to be wholly occupied in
examining its sharp point, or trying the strength of the
nether end by striking it against the marble ﬂoor ; but
half smiles and ﬂitting blushes, which passed over his
dark cheeks and brow, and beamed for a moment in his
full black eye, evinced that the sallies of his blithe
sister had not missed their mark. At the lower end
of the board sate Magnart, and he too was smiling and
showing so goodly an aspect, that how he gained
Polyanthida by winning the heart of that noble heiress
appeared to be no deep mystery. A blooming boy sate
on his knee and leaned forward with both his arms on
the table to catch the jests of Zelneth, at which he
laughed louder than all the company, till, on spying
Phantasmion, he sprung from his father’s knee and ran
up to him, exclaiming, “ Our cousin is not come ! Un-
kind Queen Maudra—.” “ Hermillian ! hold thy peace l”
cried Zelneth, while her brow assumed that lofty air
which naturally belonged to it, but which the smiles of
‘ youth and gaiety were continually charming away. “ Our
beloved Iarine returned home of her own accord, when
the messenger was sent to tell her of her father’s illness.”
“ All a false pretence, I dare be sworn !" murmured the
boy as he quitted the apartment, rushing past the
prince, whom at ﬁrst he had taken for one of his
familiar acquaintances. '

ment, but he made an effort to conceal his feelings, and
when he looked on the graceful ﬁgure of Karadan, he
almost felt glad that Iarine was not there to behold it
too. Arzene courteously invited him to join the repast,
and, seating himself at the table, he entered into dis-
course with her and her fair daughters. Zelneth con-
tinued her gay smiles, though more chary of her words
than before the approach of the noble stranger; and
Leuc0ia’s soft brown eyes, that swam in silvery lustre,
gazed on the youth when he spoke to others, but when
he turned his bright glances on herself, were bashfully
withdrawn to rest on the blue scarf still worn across his
breast. Phantasmion talked with the damsels, and
saw their beauty, but felt it no more than that of the
sculptured nymphs which gleamed in white marble
behind them.
“ We cannot enjoy our cousin's sweet company,” said
the wife of Magnart, “ but let us not forget the delicate
conserve which the messenger brought us from her.”
“Karadan,” cried Zelneth, “I warn thee not to taste
Iarine’s gift, thou wilt be sure to ﬁnd it as bitter as
Wormwood.” While the dark stripling allowed Arzene
to pour some of the rich viand on his plate, his elder
sister oﬂ'ered a portion of it to Phantasmion, who
accepted her courtesy, well pleased to taste what had
come from the hands of the Island princess. After
eating a few mouthfuls of the conserve, he ﬁxed his
eyes on the vessel from which it had been taken: no
sooner had he marked its resemblance to the silver
pitcher into which he had seen Iarine pour the many-
coloured ﬁsh, than his head swam dizzily, the brilliant
lights and smiling faces danced before him, then vanished

into darkness, and soon he sank fainting from his seat
at the board. Karadan, who sat next him, and had
been watching his actions instead of ' tasting the spicy
food, held out his arms and prevented him from falling
on the ﬂoor. Immediately after Phantasmion was sur-
' rounded by all who had been sitting round the table,
and was borne by attendants, at the command of Arzene,
to a luxurious chamber of the palace.

CHAPTER IX.
mrmnm raxss POSSESSION or run s11.vnn Pircnnn.
PHANTASMION remained without sense or motion for
nearly an hour, but, opening at length his heavy lids, he
beheld faces bright and soft bending over him, and felt
as if he had awakened from the sleep of death and
beheld angels watching his reanimation. Arzene, when
she perceived that he was about to raise his head, made
a sign to her daughters and they glided out of the room,
while the youth, ere he again relapsed into unconscious-
ness, felt as if he had seen but the ﬁgures of a dream.
The lady now called to mind a sovereign antidote
against the eifects of poison; this she administered, and
seeing her patient recover more thoroughly, she left him
to court refreshing slumbers, guests which, when they
need to be courted, never come. The torpor that lately
possessed the prince was now exchanged for restlessness
and burning heat; he rose from his couch, and sought
the fresh air from a balcony which looked out on smooth
turf, bounded by a sheet of water. In the midst of the
lawn stood Karadan embracing the silver pitcher which
had lately graced the supper table, as if in an ecstasy of
joy ; but soon his looks and gestures changed ; the
pitcher fell from his arms; he gazed upon it with a
countenance of grief; he clasped his hands; and his
dark face up-turned to the clear calm sky, appeared to

quiver with emotion, while tears that ﬁlled his eyes
glittered in the moonshine. Toward his right hand was
a tall cypress, on one of the higher boughs of which an
owl standing with his body erect, his wings closed, and
his plumage smooth as ivory, looking like a ﬁgure
carved out of the wood of the tree. When Karadan
took up the fallen vessel and advanced to the water’s
edge, this bird upreared the horn-like tuft upon his
head, and, light as thistle—down, he ﬂew from the sum-
mit of the cypress to a lower bough, only a few feet
from the ground. Meantime the dark youth cast the
pitcher’s glutinous contents on the grass, and, kneeling
down, immersed the vessel in the water not many paces
from the cypress tree. While he was employed in
rinsing it, the owl quitted the bough, and came hovering
around him with such a soft smooth ﬂight, that the
abstracted youth perceived not the bird till he saw its
shadow before him on the gleaming pool; then he lifted
up his hand to scare it away, but, after eddying round
the lawn with airy motion, it returned to the same spot
and began to feed on the ﬁshy mass which had been
poured from the‘pitcher. A merry hoot, mimicking the
owl’s cry, burst from some part of the mansion: the bird
seemed not to heed it, but Karadan started and hastened
away, wrapping the pitcher in his loose garment.
Phantasmion’s attention was now arrested by ringing
laughter, and the name of Iarine uttered repeatedly in
two different voices, one low and murmuring as the
rustle of a willow grove in the wind, the other high and
clear as the breeze that plays among the pendulous
branches. I-Ie moved towards the place whence the
sounds proceeded, and beheld the interior of an apartment

on the same ﬂoor with that which he had quitted. The
curtains in front of the chamber had been closed, but
were now drawn partly aside to. admit the air, and,
through this open space, Phantasmion had glimpses of
Zelneth and Leucoia, untwisting their platted hair beside
a lofty mirror. Their words came distinctly to his ear
as he stood under the awning beside the drapery of the
apartment, but now they had changed the subject of
“ The picture!” cried Zelneth, “ ah! I had
forgotten ! it must be lying in the wood." “ Trampled
beneath the hoofs of deer, mayhap,” rejoined Leucoia,
discourse.
“ or perchance, the hare has found it smooth enough to ’
couch upon." “ Well,” replied her sister, “ I would
that Penselimer had no other perﬁdy than mine to
complain of. He scarcely knows my face.” “ Yet how
hast thou dwelt on his !” rejoined Leucoia ; “ how hast
thou imagined the strain he is breathing forth, and heard
the very sounds of the harp-chords which he seems to
he striking! None but Penselimer, no living breathing
lover-—” “Dear Leucoia,” cried Zelneth, “why re-
member dreams which even the dreamer has forgotten?
I have ceased to be a child—” “ Since this morning!”
rejoined Leucoia in a low tone. Zelneth laughed, and
with some hesitation she answered, “ The visions of our
earliest years soon fade away, or serve but to brighten
the image of some real object, like forms of frost that
shine in the chill morning, but, when the sun is high,
are changed to dew-drops which sparkle on the ﬁrm
green leaves.” Leucoia sighed, and Zelneth said, with
a glance of kindness, “ Shall I ask Semiro to give thee
that scarf, Leucoia ?” “Hast thou such inﬂuence?”
the maid replied. Zelneth looked up and perceived

that Leucoia strove to prevent a tear from descending
upon her cheek. “Dear sister,” she said, “thou art
still tremulous from thy jeopardy in the morning. I
had begun to think thou hadst forgotten Dariel, or
remembered him only as I do.” The tears now trickled
down Leucoia’s face and Zelneth hung over her in silence,
seeming at a loss for words of comfort.
Phantasmion was about to ‘retire, but at that moment
Karadan entered the room, and the prince felt con-
strained to tarry. The youth lingered for a while by
Leucoia’s side, as if he had something to say or to hear
spoken of; but the sisters were silent, and he was about
to leave the room, when Zelneth laid her hand upon
him, saying, “ Stay, brother,,and tell us what_thou
thinkest of Semiro? Hast thou ever seen a youth of
more noble aspect? ” “ I have seen many comely faces
ere now,” replied the boy, " and some that are better
worth studying than his.” “ The comeliness of Semiro’s
face may be seen without much study," answered the
fair damsel with a smile; “but, dear Karadan,” she
added, “ I have been thinking of that fearful beast
which still lurks in the woodland. When the stranger
is recovered, pray invite him to hunt the panther with
thee.” “Dost thou think I need his aid ? " cried the
youth warmly. “ ’Twere folly to reject so good a thing
when it comes in thy way," replied the maiden.
“ What hindered him from despatching the beast this
morning?" rejoined the dark youth. “ Not want of
manliness,” cried Zelneth quickly; “Karadan, to judge
from looks, I should say he would wield sword and
lance better than thou.” “That is as shall hereafter
appear!” exclaimed the son of Magnart with ﬂashing

’ eye: at that moment he grasped his javelin and
advanced further into the room, so that Phantasmion
saw his countenance plainly. The prince began to glow,
‘and, forgetful of everything but the menacing looks of
Karadan, he laid his hand on the sword in his girdle,
but, recollecting that he was unseen, he refrained from
drawing it forth. “ Yes, yes,” cried the youth in a low
smothered voice, “ I am neibllel‘ ﬁt 110 win a lady’s love,
it seems, nor to do her manly service.” Here Leucoia
turned from the glass, with her fair dishevelled tresses
in her hand, to look upon Karadan’s ﬂushed face, while
Zelneth playfully sank on one knee, and, catching hold
of her brother's robe, besought his pardon with 3,1-oh
humility in her smiling eyes. “ Dear brother !” she
cried, “I spake but in jest; what I think of thee in
very truth—" “ Nay, spare thy assurances, dear
Zelneth,” said Leucoia, “Karadan little cares how he
looks. in thy glass. If thou couldst assure him that
Iarine will not prefer Semiro to Karadan, that anxious
brow would become as smooth as this mii-for)’ The hlood
was rapidly overspreading the face of the agitated youth
as Leucoia spoke thus, and Zelneth, quickly rising from
the ﬂoor, exclaimed, “ Hath Semiro seen Iarine then?
how knowest thou that?” “I do but guess it,” an-
swered Leucoia ; “ certainly he seemed to know that we
were expecting our cousin, and when he hen;-d that she
was not to come I saw him turn quite pale, and look as
much distraught as thou and Karadan are looking now.” ,
Leucoia’s hint had indeed banished all the gay looks and
dimples from her sister’s countenance, just as 9, pebble,
ﬂung into a pool, causes a crowd of circling insects and
glancing ﬁshes to disappear; but quickly they return,

and as quickly did the face of Zelneth resume its easy
brightness, while the eyes of Karadan seemed ready to
overﬂow, and, to hide the tears that would not be
repressed, without another word, he left the apartment.
When Karadan had withdrawn Phantasmion too
retired, and sought the chamber he had quitted, where
keen thoughts stimulated his mind till sleep suppressed
them with imperceptible hand, and presented in their
stead her strangely mingled pictures. But at early
dawn those thoughts rose up again to awaken the
sleeper; he left his couch, descended to the lawn by
winding stairs that led from the balcony, and walked ‘
beside the shallow lake. Thence he roamed on to a
rich garden where the ﬂowers were still sleeping covered
with dew, and the marble statues which gleamed in
morning's timid light, now that livingcompanywas absent,
seemed to share the beauties of their pleasant home with
the lonely wanderer. Entering a dim alley, Phantasmion
was struck by one still and graceful form, which, though
not seen in front, appeared more perfect than any he had
passed. It was crowned with fresh ﬂowers and stood
beside an arbour, the head thrown back, the arms uplift-
ing an amber coloured urn, which glowed in light ad-
mitted at the end of the arched walk. Phantasmion
admired the easy air with which those polished arms
sustained their burden, the swan-like throat inclined a
little to one side, and the full drapery ﬂowing in soft
curves from its deep and narrow zone. But sure those
folds are not of marble! they undulate in a passing
breeze, and glossy tresses gleam between the rose-wreath
which partly hides them. “Is it clear '1” cry voices
from under the trees. “ Clear as clearest amber,”

replied the fancied statue, turning round and showing
the face of Zelneth. At sight of the prince her eyes
brightened; smiling and whispering she gave the urn
into the hand of Leucoia, who had come forth from the
arbour, and now returned to her seat within, among
heaps of rejected ﬂowers and vessels of new wine.
A blush slightly tinged the prince’s cheek as he
greeted the fair daughter of Magnart, but it rose some-
what higher when young Hermillian, who sate at
Leucoia’s feet, looked up with eyes of wonder and
exclaimed, “ Well ! here thou art, and neither of us need
go far to serve thee ! Dost thou see that yellow wine ?
It was prepared for Iarine, but thou art to drink it—to
my sorrow. Not that I am sorry for thy being here;
and let me tell thee, good Semiro, that I was the chief
maker of the delicate beverage. Indeed now, sister!
Did I not gather more than half the ﬂowers? And I
would have carried it to thy chamber too, but Zelneth
cried, ‘ Peace, child ! Dost think I will trust thee with
it ‘I’ Yet other days I had need be shod with wings"
Here the prattler suddenly paused, struck by the
altered looks of Phantasmion, who had relapsed into his
former weakness, and now reeling forward fell upon the
ﬂoor of the arbour close by his side. “ O haste,
I|eucoia,” cried Zelneth; “seek for some one to bear
Semiro to the house.” Leucoia departed, and soon
returned with Karadan, who bore Phantasmion to a couch
in one of the apartments of the mansion. i

The youth quickly recovered from this slight renewal '
of former illness, and looking up he again beheld Zelneth.‘
He now blushed more deeply than before, and a smile, '
which he could not suppress, played upon his lips when
,___...-__._’~ --

he saw the beautiful maiden standing a little way oﬁ",
with her eyes timidly cast towards him. Alas for
Zelneth ! she is deceived by that bright smile, and takes
for feelings like her own the glow of youthful fancy,
which loves to feed on images of joy, and kindles at the
sight of beauty, even while the heart lies still, as a bird
beneath its mother’s wing. “Take this juicy citron,”
said the damsel; “ my mother sends it thee.” In speak-
ing ‘these words, she cast a momentary glance at the
stranger, then threw down her eyes while she offered
him the fruit. Phantasmion took the citron and seemed
intent on tearing it apart, but all the time he was
thinking how he might lead the fair Zelneth to speak
of Iarine. At last he resolved to break the spell which
seemed binding him to silence; he took the hand of
Zelneth, like one who is about to plead earnestly, and
looking in her face with an animated expression, “Fairest
maiden —” he said; but at those words he paused,
having caught sight of anotherface reﬂected in an opposite
mirror. It was that of Leucoia, who stood near the door
behind the curtains of the couch; her head was drooping,
and tears were about to ﬂow from her pale face into her
‘bosom; while Zelneth stood erect, with brightest bloom
upon her cheek, and strove to hide her joy under an air
of majesty. So after summer rains we see a stately
ﬂower raising its crimson disk to hail the sunshine,
while underneath, the snowy bells of some frail plant
lean forward on their bending stem, and still weep dew-
drops. Leucoia stole away and Zelneth followed her,
not casting a glance at the noble youth of whose heart
she now felt secure.

CHAPTER X.
HERMILLIAN CHARGES KARADAN WITH POISONING
HIS OWL.
PHANTASMION was musing on the demeanour of Zelneth
and Leucoia when their mother approached him with a
cup and phial in her hand. At sight of her the prince
leaped lightly from his couch, and the lady exclaimed, as
he made his courteous obeisance, “ It glads 1ne to ﬁnd
that thou hast more need of pleasant food than of bitter
infusions ; come with me, I pray thee, and partake of a
simple repast.” Phantasmion attended his gentle hostess
to an apartment where Magnart and the household were
already assembled, but the ﬁrst object that struck his
eye was young Hermillian. The boy refused the dainty
fare which his sisters offered him, and stood with his
back to the table, looking on the body of a large bird
which lay motionless on his outspread palms, without a
sign of life in its prominent eyes. “ O, father! he never
blinks in all this light!” cried the sorrowful child, his
blooming cheeks ﬂooded with a fresh gush of tears; “ he
is stone dead, and I know who it is that has killed him.”
Hermillian repaired to his father’s side, and continued
weeping and whispering in the ear of Magnart, who bent
forward to listen, while Karadan kept his eyes ﬁxed on
the board in moody silence, and Arzene cast inquiring
glances, ﬁrst at one of her sons and then at the other.

Phantasmion looked at the dead bird, and thought it
was the same which ﬂuttered over the head of Karadan
the night before. New suspicions crossed his mind as
he remembered the pitcher and its noxious contents: he
took no heed of Zelneth, whose beaming eyes were ﬁxed
upon his countenance; nor thought for a moment of
Leucoia, who watched to see whether that gaze was
returned. “Speak aloud, Hermillian,” cried Magnart,
“ I cannot understand this muttering.” The child cast
a side-long glance at Karadan; then, wrapping himself
in the loose portion of his father’s robe, he began his
voluble story. “ Last night,” said he, “ I made an out-
cry in my sleep, for I thought that an arrow whizzed
through the air, and pierced my own poor owl to the
heart. ‘Go to sleep again,’ said my nurse, ‘the owls
are booting, and their noise has put this dream into thy
head ;’—but, as I would not be paciﬁed, she took me to
the window, that I might look out and see with my own
eyes that he was alive and well.” “ How didst thou
know it was thy owl ?” said his father. “ O ! I know
every feather of him,” replied the child eagerly; “ I ﬁrst
found him in his nest, nigh the top of an old tower, when
he was covered with mere down, and, as soon as I looked
in, he raised himself on his legs, puffed out his body and
began to hiss at me, just as baby sister does when I
offer to take away her playthings.” “ But what was the
owl doing last night?” said Magnart. “ Alas!” cried
Hermillian, resuming his mournful countenance, “ he
was perched on a lower bough of the cypress near the
pond, and up went the feathers of his head into a goodly
ruff, while he bent forward and peered down on busy
Karadan.” “ Be silent, foolish boy!” cried his brother

sternly, and Arzene, who had been observing her son’s
troubled looks with surprise, beckoned to ‘Hermillian;
but Magnart said, “ Nay, Karadan ! let us hear how the
owl met his death; ” and the boy exclaimed, “ He met
his death by eating the conserve which Karadan threw
out of the pitcher ; I hooted to him over and over again,
but he would not answer me, so eager was he to feast
upon that poisonous food." “ Prithee, mother, send him
away,” cried the dark youth; “ how canst thou suffer
him to babble so foolishly!” “ Yes, Karadan,” the
younger boy rejoined, with a glance of deﬁance, which
hecast over his father’s shoulder, after having climbed
the back of his chair, “ and thou didst not taste amorsel
of the mess thyself, though helped to it abundantly.”
Arzene commanded Hermillian to be silent, but she
looked with a grave countenance at Magnart, and said,
softly, “ My husband, what thinkest thou of this '£”
“ Indeed I think,” replied he witha lofty smile, “ that
Iarine can send no dish wherein Maudra may not mingle
poison. We must transplant that sweet ﬂower to a hap-
pier soil: what sayest thou, Karadan ?” His son and
his guest both reddened at his speech, but on Karadan’s
cheek the ﬂush subsided into deadly paleness. “ Where.
is the pitcher, good wife ?” cried Magnart, smiling;
“ has our eldest son stolen it 'l Thou seest what griev-
ous charges are preferred against thee, Karadan.” “Nay,”
replied Arzene, looking with persuasive mildness on the
gloomy countenance of her son ; “ he has given me his
jewelled cup in exchange for the pitcher, though I shall
not be long in ﬁnding some excuse to give it him back
again.” “And I have neither cup nor pitcher,” said
Hermillian, appealing to his father; “ and because

Karadan is enamoured of Iarine, my harmless owl is to
be sacriﬁced.” “The eldest son,” cried Zelneth, “has
his mother’s heart in fee, and other children may but
hold the soil under him.” “ Yesterday,” said Arzene,
“ some of you declared that I favoured my younger
children !” Then she took her lute and thus she sang,
while Hermillian, who needed no soft music to charm
his melancholy away, was sitting on the ground and
playing with her train: ~
Deem not that our eldest heir
Wins too much of love and care ; ~
What a parent’s heart can spare,
Who can measure truly?
Early crops were never found
To exhaust that fertile ground,
Still with riches ’twill abound,
Ever springing newly.
See in yonder plot of ﬂowers
How the tallest lily towers,
Catching beams and kindly showers,
Which the heav’ns are shedding:
While the younger plants below
Less of suns and breezes know
Till beyond the shade they grow,
High and richly spreading.
She that latest leaves the nest,
Little ﬂedging much carest,
Is not therefore loved the best,
Though the most protected ;
Nor the gadding, daring child,
Oft reproved for antics wild,
Of our tenderness beguiled,
Or in thought neglected.

’Gainst the islet’s rocky shore
Waves are beating evermore,
Yet with blooms ’tis scattered o’er,
Decked in softest lustre :
Nature favours it no less
Than the guarded still recess,
Where the birds for shelter press,
And the hare-bells cluster.
Arzene would have taken up another strain, all the
good company being silent, though Magnart alone heeded
the words of the song, but suddenly, as a rebounding
ball, Hermillian leaped into the air: unheeded by any
eye but his, the owl had risen from the ﬂoor,_ and sailing
along the roof, silent as a snow-ﬂake, disappeared under
the arch of a lofty window. Arzene laid down the lute,
well pleased to see the happy child bound through the
lawn, clapping his hands and hallooing to the owl over-
head, then swiftly pursue him into the grove, where he
hastened to seek shelter from the sunny glare.

CHAPTER XI.
PHANTASMION IS ENTERTAINED BY HIS HOST’S FAMILY
IN THE GARDEN.
TOWARD evening Phantasmion was seated beside
Arzene in the farther part of the pleasure-ground: on
the one hand light cascades twinkled athwart the foliage
of a hanging orchard, on the other bright-eyed deer,
followed by troops of fawns, tripped into the greensward
from a darksome wood, then retiring to the sylvan covert,
seemed to grow into that arborous landscape‘, as their
branched antlers mingled with the boughs. Just in
front of the bank where he sate, the children of Magnart
danced round beds of blooming plants, which rose like
bright embroidery from the shaven turf, or, forming one
regular line, resembled a ﬂower-spike on which the
lower blossoms are fully blown, the others gradually
greener and closer up to the sheathed bud which crowns
the summit. Zelneth admired the forbearance of Semiro,
who kept his seat beside the matron, believing it to be
painfully practised for her sake; but, well disposed to
tempt him out of this rigour, she approacheda tree near
the spot he occupied, and, snapping a twig from one of
the branches, full half its foliage seemed to ﬂy away;
this was a bevy of green doves, which, sweeping rapidly
before the prince's eye, proceeded to augment the verdure
of an opposite shrub. Phantasmion smiled carelessly as
F

‘ he raised his eyes to the damsel, and that smilewas _
more than returned by Zelneth, who yet lingered under
the tree which the doves had deserted. Soon she was
springing beside the cascades in the orchard knoll, her
loose robe appearing by glimpses betwixt the leaves,
white as those foamy streams. Now she bends over
them to scoop the water in a shell, and now comes forth
again, with the dripping vessel in her hand, attended by
a train of squirrels. Go back, blithe squirrels, to your
leafy haunts; it is more than a picture that Zelneth
now dreams of, and the maiden has no heart to chase
you round the lawns and groves. She laid the shell
before Leucoia’s stag, but he playfully threw it over with
his horn, and wetted the foot of his fair mistress. Zel-
neth heard not her sister’s mild reproach, but now
grown weary of this game, where all the lover’s part was
supplied by fancy, she kneels down over against the
bank tb place ﬂowers in a jar, and seems to be wholly
occupied with the rich hues of amaranths and roses,
while her softer cheek, on which Semiro perchance is
gazing, surpasses the garden’s pride in its deep crimson.
But soon Iarine’s name has caught her listening ear.
“ Were it not for Iarine,” sighed the matron, “father
and son might both sink into the grave.” The maiden
looked up, and saw that the eyes of the prince were
eagerly ﬁxed on Arzene; the damask rose, which now
fell, from her hand, still blushed bright red, but from
Zelneth’s cheek the hue of joy had faded. In haste she
ﬁnished her task, and rising from the turf displayed
before her mother the vase of various ﬂowers. Arzene
praised the well-formed group, and looked with silent
pride on her beauteous daughter. “The spirit like the

outward form !” Phantasmion murmured. Arzene
thought _he spoke of Zelneth, but he was far away on
the Island of the Black Lake, and saw neither the
ﬂowers nor the‘ fair trembler who held them. “Thou
wert speaking of Albinet and Albinian,” he rejoined;
“ how saidst thou that they are kept from sinking into
the grave?” Zelneth retired, and approaching her
sister, poured all that the vase contained upon the
garden mould. Leucoia withdrew her vest, which was
sprinkled by the water. “A second wetting from thy
hand in one short hour!” said the maiden. “And
what have the roses done that they must be turned
adrift to wither ?” “Why does our mother keep him
listening to such tedious tales ?” cried Zelneth. “Tedious
to whom ?” replied Leucoia. “ If he ﬁnds them so he
will not listen long.”
Zelneth selected a few choice ﬂowers from the heap
which lay at her feet, joined graceful buds with half
eiipanded blossoms, then with ﬂushed cheek and ﬂutter-
ing heart, knelt down betwixt Arzene and the prince to
ﬁx the posy in her mother’s girdle. Phantasmion was
still hanging on the words of his hostess, and still the
discourse was concerning Anthemmina’s peerless child.
“ Magnart believes,” pursued the dame, “ /that she
silently loves our son; but, ‘by Karadan’s report, she
thinks more of one who is dead and gone, than of those
who live but to serve and worship her.” Hitherto‘
Zelneth had been studiously disposing the ﬂowers in
Arzene’s bosom, but now she raised her eyes, and saw
Phantasmion with rapt countenance gazing upward, as
if he contemplated some glorious vision in the evening
sky. Then she bowed her head, and one of her massy

tresses fell upon the prince’s hand. He started from
his reverie, and beheld the lovely Zelneth looking at
him with eyes full of love and sorrow, tears on her
cheek, and her wild locks, which had broken from
restraint, falling in careless abandonment to the ground
where she knelt. Again he blushed and smiled, and
his was a face on which smiles and blushes appeared to

ﬂowery waters and crystal meads seems tenfold sunnier
than in a barren plain. Quickly as touchwood ﬁres at
a spark, while the ﬂint from which it ﬂew is coldas
ever, poor Zelneth’:1 heart kindled with sudden joy.
Scorning her own distrust, scarce able to endure the
tide of pleasure that overﬂowed her bosom, she rose and
glided lightly over the lawn. Meantime, Phantasmion
observed Leucoia leaning against a tree, with her eyes
turned toward the bank where he sate beside Arzene.
The dainty leaves collected for the stag had fallen to
her feet: and he too seemed little to heed them, while
his large mild eye was fondly ﬁxed on the absent face of
the damsel.
But Zelneth wandered on to a pool which gleamed
betwixt the unbranched stems of trees like a mirror in
its frame. And now she hears the sound for which her
ear listens: she cannot be deceived; Semiro is tracing
her footsteps. With tremulous limbs, which half refused
to carry her forward, she gained the palm trees, and
standing between them, eyed the waterfowl which ﬂew
out of the bordering wood, and caused a transient
whirlpool in the glassy lake with sudden plunge, then
made it roar and whiten as they rushed hither and thither
on whirring wings. Ere the tumult had subsided,

Phantasmion stood before Zelneth ; his words were
drowned in the hubbub of the waters ; but he presented
a letter cased in ivory, which the spouse of Magnart, to
try his dispositions toward the dark-eyed maid, had
charged him to lay before her. Zelneth had forgotten
all men but one, and dreamed not that what he held in
his hand reported of any heart but his own. With
feigned reserve she turned away to caress a graceful bird
in mantle of silver grey, which seemed to imitate some
stately damsel as it trod the margin of the pool. “ Pretty
crane,” said Zelneth, stroking its silky plumage, “what
hast thou to say of thy fair mistress, Iarine ? Has she
never a thought to bestow upon the living ! Wert thou
not given to Karadan as an earnest of a better gift
hereafter?” The letter in its carved case fell from
Phantasmion’s hand; his heart throbbed fast; he fell
on his knees before the lady, and seizing her robe,
exclaimed, “ O ! Zelneth, Zelneth, this is but one of thy
jests ? Karadan has not indeed won the heart of Iarine?”
Zelneth looked upon his face, where passion was plainly
pictured ; but now she knew that not for her his cheek
glowed, his lip quivered ; and, when her eye sought the
ground, she espied upon the ivory case, the letters of an
unloved name. Pale and speechless she turned away,
her heart swelling with sorrow. Midway between the
pool and the ﬂowery lawn she joined Leucoia, who,
having seen Phantasmion throw himself at her sister’s
feet, expected to behold the maiden’s face beaming with
happiness. “I am weary," said Zelneth, in a languid
tone ; “ let me lean on thee. O, sister he loves Iarine !"
Then Leucoia saw that her ﬁrst guesses were true, and
became on a sudden right eloquent, whispering a thousand

‘consolations which she herself had a thousand times
rejected. Phantasmion followed them to Arzene’s bower,
paid many abrupt courtesies to the sorrowful maiden,
placed a lute in her hand, and scarce knowing what he
said in his confusion, entreated her to sing. Zelneth
swept the chords with hurried ﬁnger, then accompanied
their expressive chime with these words :—
While the storm her bosom scourges,
What can calm a troubled sea ‘P
_ Will the heaving, dashing surges,
Tranquil through persuasion be?
Rest, my soul, like frozen ocean!
Let thy wavy tumult sleep!
Rise no more in vexed commotion,
Heedless where the gale may sweep.
Clouds that have the light partaken,
Round yon radiant planet rolled,
Lingering in the west forsaken,
Soon shall glimmer, wan and cold:
All our thoughts are gay and golden,
While the sun of hope they shroud;
Those bright beams no more beholden,
Turn again to watery cloud.
He that scorns the smiling valley,
Fragrant copse and gentle stream,
Forth for distant heights to sally,
Whence deceptive colours gleam ;
Late shall ﬁnd that cold and dreary,
’Tis but from afar they glow,
Shall not when his feet are weary,
Win the blossomed vale below.
Having stolen a glance at Phantasmion, who was
leaning against the arbour with his eyes ﬁxed on the
ground, Zelneth gave him back the lute, when all the

CHAPTER XII.
AFTER MEETING WITH ADVENTURES IN THE WOOD,
PHANTASMION GOES TO SEEK PENSELIMER.
“ THOU hast not found the panther yet my son !” cried
Magnart, as he met Karadan coming from the wood with
a train of dogs at his heels, and the spoils of a wild
beast hanging over his shoulder, “ This is the hide of an
ounce,” pursued he, “I know it by the white ground."
“ The panther shall not escape me to-morrow,” answered
the youth, looking as if he would fain have avoided the
company that greeted him, as he emerged from the out-
skirts of the forest. “ Semiro will hunt with thee
to-morrow,” said his father, “ Thou wilt not withstand
this plea '2” added he, turning to his guest, whom he
had been urging to prolong his stay in Polyanthida.
Upon that Karadan looked sternly at Phantasmion,
and striking his spear on the ground, he said in a low,
deep voice; “ I pray thee, noble stranger, to accept my
father’s hospitality, but endanger not thy life by pur-
suing the same game with me.” “ Noble Karadan,”
rejoined Phantasmion, with a kindling eye and cheek,
“ I will pursue no game which I am not as free to follow
as thou art ; but danger to my life will never deter me
from my just enterprise.” Then checking himself at sight
of Arzene’s anxious face and Magnart’s uplifted eyebrow,
he added in a lighter tone, “surely I have some right

to pursue this panther, for it was I who started it ﬁrst—.”
“Thou knowest not who started it before thee,” mur-
mured Karadan ; but at the urgent request of his mother
he reluctantly appointed an hour to meet Phantasmion
in the wood on the following day, and then hastened
homeward, outstripping Magnart, who suited his pace to
that of the young children, as well as the stranger youth
who remained by the side of Arzene.
Next morning the prince accoutred himself for the
chase, and partook of an early repast, at which neither
Karadan nor his two elder sisters were present. Arzene
looked less cheerily than usual, as she cast her eye round
the board, and when Phantasmion set forth, she accom-
panied him through the lawn, speaking much of Kara-
dan’s over-hardihood. Hermillian skipped by her side,
and drank in more of the morning’s balm than even the
dewy ﬂowers, which the sun seemed to paint with richer
hues, while it stole their tears away. “ When shall I be
old enough to hunt 1” exclaimed the boy, scattering the
posy which he had been gathering with rapture : “ Dear
mother! before I am as tall as Karadan, I will be more
venturous and rash than he !” At parting, Arzene
placed in the hand of her guest a phial of the precious
liquor, which had hastened his cure, bidding him
administer the contents to himself or Karadan, ‘should
either of them receive a wound that day.
Phantasmion accepted the phial, as he had listened
to the mother’s story, with a courteous smile, and took
his way to the brake, where Karadan . had agreed to meet
him. He looked around, and seeing no living creature
in the wood, except deer and their fawns, he seated him-
self behind that screen of briars where he had formerly

beheld the panther, and having tightened his sandal,‘
began to examine the weapons with which Magnart had
provided him. While thus employed, he heard sounds
on the other side of the bushes ; it seemed as if steps
were approaching, then as if some one sate down upon
the turf; soon after he saw the head of the white stag,
the branches of his horns protruding beyond the shrubs
which came down to the water’s edge, and, ere he
stooped to drink, Phantasmion caught a glance of his
mild vigilant eye. From the top of an alder tree a
thrush was pouring out the gladdest notes to soothe his
patient mate, as she brooded on her nest in one of the
brambles that overhung the water. But soon Leucoia’s
voice traversed the briary fence, and softly warbled these
words :— »
The captive bird with ardour sings,
Where no fond mate rewards the strain,
Yet, sure, to chant some solace brings,
Although he chants in vain :
But I my thoughts in bondage keep,
Lest he should hear who ne’er will heed,
And none shall see the tears I weep,
With whom ’twere vain to plead.
No glossy breast, no quivering plume,
Like fan unfui-l’d to tempt the eye,
Reminds the prisoner of his doom,
Apart, yet all too nigh :
0 would that in some shrouded place
I too were prison’d fancy free,
And ne'er had seen that beaming face,
Which ne’er will beam on me!
When kindred birds ﬂeet o’er the wave,
From yellow woods to green ones ﬂy,
The captive hears the wild winds rave
Beneath a wint’ry sky I

92 P/zantasmian
And, when my lov’d one hence shall ﬂeet,
Bleak, bleak will yonder heav’n appear,
The ﬂowers will droop, no longer sweet,
And every leaf be sere.
Phantasmion hardly noted the meaning of Leucoia/s
song, but its melancholy murmur haunted his ear as he
loitered along in search of Karadan, and it seemed to
him as if he had heard the orphan Iarine lamenting that
hapless mother, whose image her soul cherished so
fondly. By the time that he had advanced some way
into the forest, the sun was shining in full fervour, no
cloud intercepted its beam, no breeze winnowed the
warm air, and roused it from sleepy stillness. The lake,
which gleamed through an open space between oaks and
beeches, was all one fabric with the vaulted sky; and
neither end of the lucid pile, though the lower was
more shiny than the upper, contained a single fret or
ﬂaw. One little island was visible opposite the place
where Phantasmion stood, and the weeping birches that
grew upon its margin seemed to be intently studying
their own images in the mirror ; not one of their light
leaﬂets moved upon its pliant stem. N o rapid swallow
skimmed over the water, now shooting aloft to snatch an
insect, now wheeling round and soaring out of sight;
but a lonely heron stood beneath those trees, and seemed
as if he had fallen asleep over his task, as if the delicate
perch might glance past him unobserved. The deer
slumbered in the closest coverts, the birds had ceased to
sing, all was profoundly silent, except that from a great
distance among the trees, Phantasmion heard the
cooing of a dove; but that, too, died away, and then
no sound was audible but the murmur of a solitary bee‘

over a bed of ﬂowers, which loaded the sultry air with
fragrance. This only moving object attracted the eye
of the prince, as he sate beneath a broad-armed oak,
wondering at the delay of Karadan ; he watched the
insect roving up and down among the hyacinths, which
grew in countless multitudes far as eye could reach, till
a drowsiness began to steal over him, and it seemed
while he inhaled the odour of the blossoms, and viewed
their soft colours, as if he saw a new ﬂower gradually
rising up from among the rest. Rousing himself to
look more steadfastly at this strange appearance, he
perceived that it was no ﬂower, but an exquisite
feminine form, which stood between his eye and the
lake’s deep azure. A breath would have separated the
yellow tresses that lay upon her neck into a thousand
diverging threads, as ﬁne as gossamer; vivid bloom was
on her cheek, her eyes were blue as the torquois, and
her mantle was of the freshest green. A crown of dew-
drops glittered on her brow when ﬁrst she rose, but
quickly melted away, and she held by a silken line a
leash of butterﬂies. “Phantasmion !” she said, in a
slender, sighing voice, “ Phantasmion! thou lovest Iarine
the daughter of Anthemmina! O how fair was An‘-
themmina when she plighted her faith to Penselimer!
she was laden with beauty, like the trees of spring, that
hide the green of their leaves with amethystine clusters,
and garlands of yellow gold !” “ Who art thou ? ” cried
Phantasmion, “and why speakest thou thus to me ?"
The soft phantom replied, “I am F eydeleen, the Spirit
of the Flowers; I love the house of Thalimer, but
Karadan, to gain the charmed vessel, hath put his faith
in other powers than mine. He loves Iarine; ”—the

spirit continued to murmur the names of Karadan,
Iarine, and Anthemmina, but her breath appeared to
be stiﬂed. “ Speak on !” said Phantasmion, “what
hast thou to tell me of Karadan, Iarine, and of Anthem-
mina?” “Alas !” she feebly answered, “Oloola, the
Spirit of the Blast I-—go to Penselimer!—to, the
Deserted Palace !” the fading phantom waved her hand:
“ Even now,” she murmured, “I feel her touch! it is
like the hand of death!” While she yet spoke, the
delicate colour faded from her cheek; her face began
to shrivel ; she hung her head ; her whole form shrunk ;
then gradually sinking earth-ward, appeared to re-enter .
‘the ground whence it had arisen. While Phantasmion
was yet gazing with ﬁxed eyes, the trees, late so motion-
less, were bent by a rushing blast, which swept, as if in
triumph, across the spot where Feydeleen had stood,
disturbed the bosom of the glassy lake, then passed
away, and soon every nodding hyacinth had ceased to
sway upon its ﬂexile stem. Even in the hot sun-
beams the prince felt his blood chilled ; he rose from his
seat and felt an impulse to hasten out of the wood ; but
at that moment the deep silence of the forest was broken
by clamorous yells, and the prolonged sound of a hunter’s
horn caused the sleeping deer to arise, and the birds to
rush from the boughs they occupied, while the heron upon
the island started up and sailed off to a distant shore.
Phantasmion passed swiftly on, and soon had sight of
Karadan, who stood surrounded by vociferous dogs, with
his javelin plunged in the body of a large panther.
Indignant at this sight, the prince hurried through the
trees, and, coming in front of the young huntsman, he
saw that his countenance was full of joyful triumph, as

he bent over the grim face of the expiring beast, and
that drops of blood were slowly trickling from a wound
in his hand into Iarine’s pitcher, which he held up to
receive them. So intent was he on this occupation, and
on gazing at the panther, that he had not perceived the
approach of his rival, who, stung with jealousy at what
he beheld, and with remembrance of what the Flower
Spirit had uttered, stood a little way off, eyeing him with
ﬁery looks, and brandishing his stainless weapon, with-
out knowing exactly in what terms to couch an accusa-
tion, or how to challenge one who was already wounded
in combat. While he yet hesitated, the prince was
struck by the sound of Leucoia’s voice, crying “Karadan !"
The maiden had heard her brother wind the horn, and,
knowing by that signal that the beast was slain, she
came ﬂitting through the forest to the place of the
encounter; Phantasmion gave up all thoughts of seek-
ing a quarrel with Karadan when he saw his sister
approach : he withdrew behind the broad trunk of a tree,
and soon afterwards beheld Leucoia binding up her
brother’s wound with strips torn from her own garment,
while the dogs leaped around fawning on the maiden, as
if rejoiced at the aid that she rendered to their master.
The lady’s milk-white stag, fearless of the hounds, with
which he had long been familiar, stood beside the bloody
pard, and was the only one of the group who seemed to
‘espy Phantasmion, as he lingered among the overarch-
ing trees of thickest foliage. “ Karadan loves Iarine,”
were the words that rang in the prince’s ear, as he
retraced his steps through the forest; and, without
re-entering Magnart’s abode, he forthwith departed to
ﬁnd that of Penselimer, king of Almaterra.

CHAPTER XIII.
PENSELIMER TELLS ms STORY TO PHANTASMION.
PHANTASMION pursued his journey for several days in
that rich land, travelling by leaps, whenever he could do
so without attracting the gaze of the rustics, and taking
refreshments in the humblest dwellings. _He found that
the peasant folks in general were quite unacquainted
with the person of their king, though they had many
strange tales to tell respecting him ; but all the certain
information in these matters which the prince gained,
Was, that he lived in retirement with Laona, the mother
of Arzene and Anthemmina, the affairs of his kingdom
being managed by Sanio, a wise and worthy man, who
had been the friend of his father.
his way, according to the directions he had received, till
he found that blossomed orchards, gardens, and gay
buildings, began to be less and less frequent, and it
seemed as if, from the land of summer, he had stepped
into N ovember’s dreary domain. At length he entered
a tract which was full of fading ﬂowers and trees, clad
in the garb of autumn, and thence proceeded to a bleak
and barren moor, where cold swamps, rocks encrusted
with ashy pale lichens, or fringed with rustling fern, and
twisted uncouth trunks, that looked like mummies of
trees as they reclined in sepulchral cavities, were the
only features of the stern landscape. One light-coloured

object appeared in view just beneath a company of gaunt
pine trees that straggled over a stony slope ; this was a.
forlorn mountain ash, with foliage of transparent bright-
ness. The wind came by ﬁts, whistling through the
pine grove, and, whenever it shook the fragile ash, a
shower of yellow leaves fell from its delicate branches on
the steely pool below. Those stagnant waters were
agitated by the rough gale, and foaming waves for a
moment were visible; then again, relapsing into torpor,
they sullenly reﬂected the sullen sky and the wasting
roan tree. Streaks of dull clouds covered great part of
the heavens, but, just where the sun was sinking on the
horizon, they showed a spectral whiteness, edged with
faintest yellow and sea green. In the opposite quarter,
the moon appeared like a wan face gradually kindling
into life ; she looked out from the sky in full splendour
while Phantasmion was yet on his way; and, when he
saw her beams resting on an ancient castle, surrounded
by a moat and a ‘high and thick wall, he knew that he
beheld the domain of Penselimer. Arrived at the edge
of the moat, he surveyed the barrier before him, and,
having taken a good aim, leaped to the top of it, gained
a sure footing on the wall, and waved his sword to an
ancient domestic, who had espied him from a court-yard
below. The old man gazed in astonishment at the youth-
ful ﬁgure on the horizon, with nodding plume and glanc-
ing sword illumined by the moon-beams. Phantasmion
proceeded along the top of the wall, looking down upon
groves of cypresses and glistering laurels, till he came
over-against’ a wide lawn which fronted the castle. Down
into this grassy plain he leaped, and beheld straight
before him an ancient yew tree which rose about the

.
centre of it, casting a gigantic shadow on the moonlit
sward. As the prince passed under this tree on his way
to the castle, he perceived that a tall man, habited in a
long black stole, was leaning over one of i.ts broad arms,
and looking from amid its dusky foliage, at the star
‘bright sky. Just then a thin vapour was ﬂitting across
the moon; but soon Phantasmion beheld the side of the
gazer’s face in a clear light, and was struck with the
majesty of his features, and the placid melancholy of
their expression. He stood still, feeling assured that
this was Penselimer, and considering how to proceed;
when the man in the mourning robe turned round, and,
having scanned his face, exclaimed reproachfully, “ Ha!
Dorimant; art thou come to render up the silver pitcher ?”
Phantasmion, who had been continually thinking of
Iarine's silver pitcher ever since he ﬁrst saw it in the
hands of his rival, was too much struck with these words
to make a prompt reply; but the lofty personage before
him pointed to the moon: “ Thou art come,” said he,
“ from visiting the lady Anthemmina !" “ King Pen-
selimer,” cried Phantasmion, a little confused, “ I come
from Palmland.” “ It is false,” rejoined the monarch,
in a tone of solemn indignation; “ with my own eyes I
saw thee descend from the sky, and alight on the hither
side of those ﬁr trees !” Then again he gazed upward
at the moon: “I had been pleading with her all this
evening,” said he; “she was still silent and obdurate ;
she would not promise to restore the silver pitcher, but
“ Noble
Pense1imer,” cried the youth impetuously, “ I know not
what thou meanest by pointing to the sky, and speaking
of a silver pitcher.” “ And perchance,” rejoined the

king, with a disdainful smile, “thou dost not behold the
fair Anthemmina in heaven, and perchance she too will
deny that she is at this moment looking down upon thee
and me." “ King Penselimer,” said Phantasmion, who
now began to understand why the sovereign of Alma-
terra lived in retirement, “ I see that fair dispenser of
light as plainlyas thou dost, and true it is that she has
guided me to thy abode; but the lady Anthemmina I
never beheld while she sojourned upon earth.” “Art
thou not mine enemy, Dorimant?” inquired the king
earnestly, perusing the features V of his youthful visitant.
“ Dorimant, king of Palmland, sleeps with his ances-
tors,” replied the youth; “ I-know not why thou callest
him thine enemy, nor how he can have injured thee
concerning a silver pitcher?” “ Ha, indeed!" said
Penselimer, “ then I will tell thee the whole story of my
wrongs ! But not here,” he added, in a low voice, cast-
ing up his eyes to the moon, “lest she should hear the
tale: it is my belief she often listens when shame or
pride forbids her to reply.” Then he moved away, and
beckoned to Phantasmion, who followed him, as he str'ode
across the loan, thinking of Iarine with the silver pitcher
on her head, and Karadan pressing it to his bosom, and
how the ﬁshy woman by the sea-shore, and the bright
fairy in the wood had both spoken of a charmed vessel.
Penselimer conducted the youth to an apartment in the
castle, where a ﬁre upon the hearth cast its light on the
walls, hung with dark paintings, and on a harp and other
musical instruments which were scattered around. The
king of Almaterra made Phantasmion take a seat oppo-
site to one which he himself occupied, and began to
speak thus: “There was a time when the beautiful

Anthemmina looked graciously upon me, and told me
every thought of her bosom: now she veils her face
when I gaze upon it, and though I spend my life in
assuring her that I seek only to be reconciled, she still
persists in chilling silence.” Phantasmion looked at
the speaker and saw no haggard looks, no traces of
anguish on his goodly face; clear and smooth was.
his high forehead, and the black locks that shadowed
it were scarcely sprinkled with grey; but ever and
anon his dark eye gave sudden‘ ﬂashes, like silent
lightning on a gloomy summer’s night. It seemed
as if something were at work within, apart from the
soul of Penselimer, something dangerous and irregular
as lightning itself. Without returning the curious
glance of Phantasmion, his eyes appearing ﬁxed on
vacancy, he proceeded thus: “ One day the lady
Anthemmina approached me, radiant with joy as with
beauty, she held in her hand a silver pitcher, and
placing it in mine, she said: ‘Penselimer, while this
charmed vessel remains in thy possession, no earthly
power can deprive thee of me !’ At these words I was
full of astonishment; I threw myself on my _knees
before the stately virgin, and, receiving the pitcher, was
unable to utter a word, but looked up eagerly in her
face to seek an explanation.
‘Dost thou believe the tale?’ said she; ‘truly thou
may’st believe it. Feydeleen has answered' my prayers,
for she loves the house of Thalimer.’ ‘But Thallo, the
king of this land,’ cried I, ‘ whom thyfather would have
thee wed-is not he a descendant of Thalimer, as well
as we two? ‘Fear nothing from him,’ the maidreplied;
‘Feydeleen, our guardian spirit, appeared to me as I

watered the ﬂowers, and in gazing at the bright phantom,
I let the pitcher fall from my hands. ‘Anthemmina,’
she said, ‘take up thy pitcher, and he in whose hands
thou shalt place it can alone be thy husband; while
he keeps it safe no other man can deprive him of thee.’
The fairy vanished, and, looking down at my feet, I saw
that my earthen pitcher was gone, and that this silver vessel,
engraved with curious characters, was lying in its place.
From the time that Anthemmina spoke thus I felt like
a new creature, and ceased to tremble in the presence of
Thallo, or of his young sister Zalia, whom my father
would have had me espouse. I cared not who was
called the sovereign of this land; the whole world
seemed. made for me since I possessed that charmed
vessel ; the rosy dawn, the noon day radiance, the
gorgeous sunset, and the spa'ngled ﬁrmament, all were
but varied images of my inward bliss; to my exulting
fancy they were but festal shows, set forth to celebrate
my happiness with Anthemmina. Alas ! alas ! the glory
of a sunset gradually gives way to darkness, and by slow
degrees the magic spectacle of midnight passes from the
heavens; but this radiance which surrounded me, and
appeared to stream from a thousand sunny fountains was
quenched as wholly and as suddenly as a man may
extinguish one poor solitary taper! She took back
again that precious gift, one that she had proffered me
with such an overﬂowing measure of unhoped for tender-
ness ; tricked me out of it by cruel art, and gave it to
king Dorimant. I saw her place it in his hand. I saw
his look of triumph as he held it aloft; more I could
not see, for I fell on the ground senseless. O! why did
I not pierce him to the heart, that base, perﬁdious man ;

doubly, nay, trebly perjured and faithless!” When
Penselimer spoke thus, Phantasmion started up, and laid
his hand on his sword, forgetting that the true spirit
of Penselimer was not there 'to render account of his
words. “ My father was an honourable man,” the
youth exclaimed; “he hath a son at least who will
maintain his honour.” The king of Almaterra looked
at him with majestic composure, as the ﬁre threw its
tremulous beam on his ﬂushed countenance, for phan-
toms were realities to him, and external realities moved
him less than phantoms. “ How thy face recalls to me
that fatal hour!” quoth he, “ that hour when the aspect
of my fate grew suddenly dark, as the glowing face of
the deep will blacken in its whole extent when the wind
rushes over it! for years I remained in a state of stupor ;
Thallo died, and I succeeded to my grandsire’s throne;
Dorimant delivered the pitcher to king Albinian, whom
Cleoras forced Anthemmina to marry; the king of
Palmland espoused Zalia, and annexed to his realm her
inheritance of Gemmaura; all these events I learned
with indifference, nothing roused ‘me till tidings were
brought that Anthemmina had perished at sea. Then I
repaired to the shore, entered a boat, and roamed over
the waste of waters, till at last I beheld my radiant
mistress arise out of the waves. From the vessel's prow
I stood gazing, and prayed aloud for wings that I might
follow her into the sky ; but a jeering voice issued from
the deep, and seemed to utter these words, ‘ Where she
is gone thou shalt never follow.’ I looked down upon
the waters and there beheld a round white glistering
face,.that seemed to be a hideous mockery of that celes-
tial visage. It rose from the surface of the sea, and there

stood before me a strange form, half ﬁsh, half woman,
which held her arms aloft, and her body inclined in the
posture of a dancing nymph, while she pointed with
one hand at me, with the other at the newly risen
Queen of Heaven; then with a burst of merriment she
plunged amid the waves, which swallowed in the
gurgling sounds of laughter.” “And before this
memorable night,” said Phantasmion, “when Anthem-
mina took her station in heaven, didst thou never
behold that bright orb which is beaming through
yonder latticed window t ” “ Before that night,” replied
Penselimer, “I never beheld any heavenly orb which
was fairer and brighter than the moon. But she, since
then, has been so diminished, that I cannot distinguish
her from the other stars.” “ And what has become of the
pitcher?” said the prince. “ That is the subject of my
constant inquiry,” replied Penselimer. “ Albinian is not
long for this world; could I regain possession of the
charmed vessel, Anthemmina might yet be mine.”
While Penselimer spoke these words, an aged lady
entered the apartment. “ Laona,” said the king, “ hast
thou heard any tidings of the silver pitcher?” “Not
yet," replied the ancient dame in a gentle tone; “go
now to repose, for Feydeleen will never help us to ﬁnd
the pitcher while the ﬂowers are sleeping. To-morrow
we will all renew our search more diligently.”
When Penselimer had quitted the apartment, Laona
looked earnestly in the face of Phantasmion, and said,
“Art thou the son of Dorimant, king of Palmland?”
“Even so,” he answered. “Alas, then,” rejoined the
ancient lady, “ why comest thou to Penselimer, and the
mother of Anthemmina?” “Because I love Anthem-

mina’s beautiful daughter,” the ardent youth replied,
“ and in all truth and honour I seek to lay my crown at
her feet. The Spirit of the Flowers knows my love,
and she has sent me hither.” “ And hath she told thee
where to ﬁnd the charmed vessel?” inquired the dame.
“ Feydeleen decreed that after Anthemmina’s time the
fortunes of her child should depend upon it, as hers did
before?” Phantasmion made no answer, being lost in
thought, and Laona added, “ Doubtless it is now at the
bottom of the sea, for my ill starred child took it with
her when she entered that fatal bark which never came
to land again. Sweet Iarine knows nothing of this
charm; she weeps when she looks on the wild waves of
the ocean, but those tears are for her mother alone.”
Phantasmion felt certain that the pitcher so earnestly
embraced by Karadan, must be this charmed vessel,
which rendered him master of Iarine’s fate, so far as to
prevent her union with any one but himself. How he
gained it, and how he might be dispossessed of it, were
anxious thoughts which cast their shadow over the
young prince’s brow. Laona perceived his distress:
“ Come,” she cried, “rest thou this night under our
roof, and to-morrow we will consider if it be possible to
ﬁnd the pitcher. Since the Flower Spirit favours thy
love, she will not suffer thee to seek in vain.” Having
spoken thus, she led her guest to a chamber of the castle.
When Phantasmion obtained sight of Laona the next
morning, he inquired if she could direct him to the
Deserted Palace. “Look out over the country,” she
replied; “below that hill which bounds the horizon
thou wilt ﬁnd the ancient abode of my husband : there
we dwelt, with Arzene and Anthemmina, before Cleoras

possessed the ﬂowery vale which thou hast lately
visited.” ,“What a black cloud,” exclaimed the youth,
“is resting on the summit of the boundary eminence!”
“That cloud,” rejoined Laona, “overhangs the dwelling
of the enchantress Melledine ; she it is who has blasted
this region, while Feydeleen vainly endeavours to count-
erwork her spells. Alas! thatoutward blasting is but
a type of the desolation that she has brought on me and
mine. Soon after the Spirit of the Flowers had blest
Anthemmina and Penselimer with the hope of their
happy union,‘ my daughter met a woman whose face
was covered with .a shining veil, as she wandered, late
in the evening, through an orchard that lies between
the palace and the mountain. ‘Come to this clear
stream,’ said the witch, ‘and thou shalt see a strange
sight.‘ Anthemmina looked into the water, and fancied
that she there beheld the face of Dorimant, her cousin
Zalia’s‘ suitor, hard by the image of her own. While
she was gazing on the shadow in the brook, that wicked
enchantress persuaded the maiden to drink out of a cup
which she presented to her. No sooner had she tasted
its contents than all her affections were transferred
from Penselimer to him whose likeness she seemed to
behold. Alas! no spell but that which beaming eyes
contain was needed to turn Dori1nant’s ﬁckle heart from
Zalia to Anthemmina, and none but that of ambition
caused him to break his faith with my faithless child,
and again offer his hand to the heiress of Gemmaura."
Phantasmion‘ looked sorrowful and abashed, but could
not feel anger against Laona, for she spoke as one in
whom no affections remain, except such as are ﬁt to live
for ever. “Dorimant is dead,” she added, “and Zalia

and Anthemmina are at rest from their troubles. Pense-
limer yet lives, and--Hark! his lute is sounding from
that gloomy cell, in which it is his pleasure to immure
himself till the moon rises.” Phantasmion listened and
heard Penselimer sing thus :—-—
The sun may speed or loiter on his way.
May veil his face in clouds or brightly glow;
Too fast he moved to bring one fatal day,
I ask not now if he be swift or slow.
I have a region, bathed in joyous beams,
Where he hath never gilded fruit or ﬂower,
Hath ne’er lit up the glad perennial streams,
Nor tinged the foliage of an Autumn bower.
Then hail the twilight cave, the silent dell,
That boast no beams, no music of their own ;
Bright pictures of the past around me dwell,
Where nothing whispers that the past is ﬂown.
The eyes of Laona shone in tears for a moment, but no
strong emotion disturbed the serene sadness of her brow.
“ Alas !” she said, “his are but mockeries of woe, that
dwell in the wild brain and never touch the heart. Yet
hark again !—" Penselimer was singing,
Grief’s heavy hand hath sway’d the lute;
’Tis henceforth mute:
Though pleasure woo, the strings no more respond
To touches light as fond,
Silenced as if by an enchanter’s wand.
Do thou brace up each slackened chord,
Love, gentle lord;
Then shall the lute pour grateful melodies
On every breeze,
Strains that celestial choristers may please.

CHAPTER XIV.
1
PHANTASMION VISITS THE DESERTED PALACE.
HAVING received the blessing of Laona, Phantasmion
departed, and, just as the castle towers were sinking out
of sight, remembered that he ought to have inquired for
the abode of Sanio. Eager, however, to explore An-
tl1emmina’s ancient dwelling-place, he hastened forward,
now running, now leaping, yet sometimes forgetting
even to move, in his deep thoughts concerning past and
future events. The sky was clear‘ in every part, except
right before him on the horizon; there the dark mass
hung so steadily, that it looked more like a black sea
than a cloud. At last he reached a smiling peninsula
in the sullen ocean of the waste: “ Here at least,”
thought he, “ Melledine has not turned the leaves
yellow when they ought to be green: here the Flower
Spirit hath her way.” Phantasmion passed the mossy
stones which of yore had formed an outer wall, and now
inclosed a neighbourhood of snakes and lizards, and
proceeded to a wilderness where commonest weeds up-
reared their heads among rare ﬂowers, and towered, and
swelled, and blossomed, and seeded, casting out their
branches on every side in unassailed prosperity and
tranquil pomp. There the soft hyacinth and rich
carnation were overtopped by thistles, the full peony
blushed among tall grass half hidden, and a solitary

I08 P/umtasmzion
arch, that once had been a gateway, was crested with
the prim larkspur and spruce jonquil. Over against a
green mound, from which the wild goats bounded at his
approach, Phantasmion discerned an imperfect outline
of two apartments; the ﬁrst was tapestried with jessa-
mine, and tenanted by owls, who stared with no
hospitable looks upon the stranger as he entered
their abode ; a shallow pool ﬂoored the second, reﬂect-
ing the ruined walls with its arched windows and
carved ornaments, over which the eglantine waved its
lithe branches, still perhaps to wave them in the gale,
when that phantom ediﬁce should have fallen under its
breath. Phantasmion paused not here, but went on to
ﬁnd the brook spoken of by Laona, passing orchards
where the unpruned boughs were bending under crowded
birds and fruit, till, through the close undergrowth, in
parts quite impervious, he perceived a stream which
ﬂowed through a vaulted opening at the base of a lofty
rock, then wandered away to the right hand. Above
that rock was a succession of crags, the highest veiled
in darkness; and this was the cloud-capped height
which he had seen from the castle. Phantasmion ap-
proached the stream close to the archway, and, looking
on its waters, discerned his own colourless shadow, and
nothing more: but, on stooping to bathe his temples
in the brook, he perceived beyond the shadow, a picture
of himself as vivid and seemingly substantial as that
which the ﬁnest mirror might have presented. It was
not looking as his natural face would have done in a
glass at that moment, for his countenance was thoughtful,
and bore traces of tears; but the countenance of the
picture appeared to be radiant with joy and love. It

did not gaze on him that gazed on it, but on another
object in the watery depth, the graceful ﬁgure of a
damsel,‘ holding up a silver pitcher so that it concealed her
face, which was bowed down upon her bosom. While
the youth still examined the picture, it gradually faded,
and he saw only the sparkling sands in the bed of the
river ; but, ere he turned away his eyes, those very sands
had formed themselves into characters, making the
names of Dorimant and Anthemmina, Iarine and Phan-
tasmion. Again they were mingled together, and,
while he thought to decypher them as before, a tinkling
melody rang out from the rocks overhead. It seemed
as if they were musical stones touched by some invisible
hand with a silver hammer, and soon they seemed to
speak thus :
Life and light, Anthemna bright,
Ere thy knell these rocks shall ring,
Joy and power, a gladdening dower,
Thou shalt shower on Palmland’s king. .
Floor of coral, roof of beryl,
Thou shalt ﬁnd afar from peril,
'While thy lovely child is dwelling
Where the palm and vine are swelling,
Crystal streams around her welling,
All the land her virtue telling.
Life and light, Antheinna bright,
Thou to Palmland's king art bringing :
Richest dower, fairest ﬂower
Is from thee for Palmland springing.
‘'‘ That king of Palmland is Phantasmion !” exclaimed
the youth in ecstacy ; “and the watery picture is my like-
ness, only like Dorimant as I resemble my father. An-
themmina’s fair child is mine,-—but how am I to gain
the charmed vessel ?” Full of joyous agitation, he

strayed along the margin of the brook, and after a time
stooped down to drink ; but, ere he had fully slaked his
thirst, a cry issued from the opposite bank, while sudden
brightness fell‘upon the water. Phantasmion at ﬁrst
imagined that he had heard the voice and saw the
shadow of a king-ﬁsher, whose emerald wings and
breast of ardent gold were casting that rainbow gleam
on the smooth current; but looking up he espied the
green 'mantle of Feydeleen, ﬂoating behind her in a
transient breeze, as she leaned from a grove of rushes
over the stream, to which her silken bodice, in hue
like the honied nectary of a blossom, was imparting its
No sooner had the fairy caught Phan-
tasmion’s eye than she pointed up the river to the place
where he had beheld the vision, and lo! there was
Karadan with his face bent over the waters while the
silver pitcher stood on the ground beside him. “ N ow
will I wrestle with thee for that pitcher !” Phatasmion
would have cried, but the words died on his lips: an
irresistible drowsiness came over him, and down he sank
in slumber beside a shady willow. Soon however a gale
of sharp fragrance awakened him, and he raised his
head ; the air had become thick and misty ; and Kara-
dan was lifting in both hands a heavy stone, as if for
the purpose of crushing the pitcher to atoms. Phan-
tasmion strove to speak, but again sleep surprised him;
thought vanished from his mind as the stream from his
eye, and with closed lids he fell back under the canopy
of the willow. When he next awoke, the clouds that
lately capped the mountain had descendedhto its base,
and all was darkness; yet in this darkness there were
spasms and slower pulses of light, which, here and there,

unveiled the rocks and the river; and one of these dis-
covered Karadan standing bewildered, his right hand
raised before his face, as if to repel the mist, and the
pitcher hanging from his left. Thereupon, with a shout,
Phantasmion rushed forward to attack his rival; but,
even as he advanced, the light was swallowed up, and
all the force and fury of his onset were bestowed on the
stem of a birch tree, while Karadan’s misguided weapon
was striking a volley of sparks out of the ﬂinty rock, in
a cleft of which the tree grew. But soon Phantasmion
started back, struck by a plaintive scream close to his
ear. Then came the ﬂickering light, and revealed the
birch tree which he had so ﬁercely assaulted, its long
pendant boughs laden with moisture, and blood drops
trickling down its silver skin. And next, eyes of steady
ﬂame were glaring upon him from a, hole in the rock,
and, while the darkness came on again, he heard a rustle
overhead, and then perceived wings as of white ﬁre
sweeping onward. While these sights were presenting
themselves, the youth imagined that he had wounded some
living female frame, and thereby exasperated a demon
who kept watch over the imprisoned object of his love ;
but a second cry from the goblin as he sailed away, and
the sense of a slight wound about the bosom, soon made
it clear that he had but startled an owl from its hiding
place, and stained a senseless trunk with his own blood.
After this interruption, he raged about in search of
Karadan, on ‘whom at last he fell with an impetuosity
which made the pitcher ﬂy out of his hand, and ﬂung
the youth himself with stunning force upon the ground,
while his own sword was shivered in the encounter. He
was bending forward, and groping for his rival, when

something plucked him hack; at the same time the
cloud was rent, and admitted a bright beam just over
the spot where the pitcher lay. Again he sprang to
seize the vessel, but it was snatched away into the dark-
ness. Doubly baﬂled at having lost both the prize and
his enemy, Phantasmion stood motionless, until he per-
ceived, straight before him, a dim ﬁgure glimmering
gigantically through a thinner part of the mist. Then,
as a great serpent gathers all his might to crush a buffalo
of unusual size and strength, letting fall his broken
sword, and rushing onward, Phantasmion coiled himself
with vast force around his foe; but a loud and bitter
cry, followed by earnest words of supplication, induced
him to relax his grasp, and, on the outskirts of the mist,
he now beheld a woman’s form, writhing on the ground,
and twisting the ends of a silvery veil which covered her
face. On one side all was yet dark ; on the other the
archway was visible, and, beneath it, an ivory boat, to
which a team of swans was fastened. The pitcher had
rolled 'to the side of the brook ; Phantasmion caught it
up, dipped it in the stream, and, urged by thirst, drank
deeply. No sooner had he done so than sleep once
more seized him, occupying his senses as fast as vapours
in a storm envelope a mountain. He was about to
examine a scroll, which he had taken out of the vessel ;
it fell from his hand, while the pitcher slipped from his
bosom; he sank down in deep slumber, with his face
toward the stream, and heard neither the voice of Kara-
dan in the cloud, nor the mournful dirge of the swans,
. which bewailed their lady’s anguish ‘with strains that
might have preluded their own death, and were given
back from under the archway with more and more
distant echoes.

On awaking he saw that a gray-haired man had hold
of his arm. He started up: boat, swans, and veiled
lady were out of sight; the scroll lay upon the ground
before him, but the pitcher was gone. “ Who has robbed
me of the silver pitcher ?” exclaimed Phantasmion, look-
ing wildly upon the old man. “ One who seemed half
inclined to take thy life also,” he replied. “When I
came hither, he was standing over thee, dagger in hand,
yet appeared irresolute.” “ Which way went he 2” cried
the youth. “ Nay, it were vain to follow him,” the
ancient man replied; “ he set out many an hour ago.”
“ And took the pitcher with him !” ejaculated the prince.
“ On espying me,” resumed the stranger, “he thrust his
dagger into his belt, caught up a silver vessel, and went
his way. Since that time I have been vainly striving
to awaken thee: I guess thou hast been drinking these
waters, which ﬂow from the enchanted domain of Melle-
dine, and are well known to produce unnatural sleep.
Had I left thee alone in this neighbourhood of spells and
sorceries, thou mightest have suffered worse than the
loss of a pitcher.” “ I owe thee many thanks,” replied
Phantasmion. “ Perchance thou canst tell me where I
may ﬁnd Sanio, the king’s minister.” “ Thou hast
found Sanio already,” rejoined the grey-haired man;
“ for I am he.” _
Phantasmion now observed that the air was clear, the
cloud conﬁned to the mountain top, and that all around
looked as when he ﬁrst came thither, save that the sun
was in a different quarter of the sky.' Placing the scroll
in his bosom, he led the discourse to Penselimer.
“ Ay! there ﬂows the stream,” quoth Sanio, “ which
ruined him and this poor kingdom. Yet it is my belief
H

that Anthemmina would never have seen Dorimant’s face
in the waters, had it not ﬁrst been pictured in her own
ﬁckle heart.” “They say that Anthemmina’s child is
fair and faithful too,” interposed Phantasmion. Sanio
smiled: “ You that are young,” he said, “search the
past only to illustrate the present; while for us that are
old the present has !ittle interest, except as it reﬂects
the past,—alas, how dully! Yes; Anthemmina had a
daughter by Albinian, whom she married, after rendering
Penselimer unﬁt to govern either wife or kingdom.”
“ He has no heir,” said Phantasmion ; “ will the son of
Arzene succeed him in his throne?” “I would fain
have it otherwise,” the old man replied: “ I have loved
Penselimer from a boy, as I loved his father before him.
It is for this cause that I repair hither to call on Melle-
dine, and entreat her to bestow some charmed cup or
potent herb, that may restore him to his senses.” “Melle-
dine!” exclaimed the prince with emotion; “can the
hot blast of the desert be persuaded to bear health
upon its wing?” Sanio hung his head: “ Strong de-
sire,” he said, “ has deceived me also : lest I should be
further deceived, I will go hence.” ,
Phantasmion accompanied the ancient noble through
the tangled grove, cutting _a way for him amid the
bushes ; and, when those impediments were past, he
spoke of his mission, and of the succours promised by
Magnart. “ Hope little from him,”,Sanio made answer,
“ and trust him with little. Such as he will smile and
take in all, and give out nothing but what is noxious,
—like glittering bogs, the warmer the sun shines on
them, the colder is the air which they exhale!” “ This
lord of Polyanthida is the counterpart of his ambitious

brother, then,” Phantasmion observed. “ A true copy,"
replied the minister, “in all but his ﬁne points, and
shining qualities. Magnart’s train hath no eyes in it;
yet he loves to unfurl it as widely as if it portrayed the
starry heavens; and rears his crest and sweeps the
ground with even more pride and consequence than his
brother peacock.” “ I have heard,”_ said the prince,
“that Glandreth is plotting with Maudra to ascend the
throne of Albinian at his decease, and moreover to unite
Palmland with his dominions.” “ And art thou igno-
rant,” said the old man, “ that his ships are, even now,
hovering about the coasts of thy country? We know
it well, for they carry off sheep and kine from the land
of Palms, and convey them to the plain of Tigridia,
which borders on this realm as well as on Rockland.”
“ Then,” cried the young monarch, “it is the interest of
Almaterra to unite with us against our warlike neigh-
bours :_ for they will soon be independent of all that her
luxuriant ﬁelds produce.” “ To second you,” the old
man replied, “ but not to begin the war. If I were as
young as Penselimer, and he as sane as I am, we might
move faster in this enterprise. Palmland has a youth-
ful monarch, let him lead the way.”

CHAPTER XV.
PHANTASMION rurrunns T0 PALMLAND.
SANIO guided his youthful companion to a solitary
mansion where he had left his attendants, and the fellow
Wanderers rested there that night ; but, before the aged
man had left his chamber, Phantasmion was far upon
his road, leaping from ﬁeld to ﬁeld, and only stopping
to inquire his way and procure food. He slept that
night in the shelter of an orange grove, having left the
desolate region far behind him ; and thus he fared till
the blooming vale of Polyanthida came in view. He
did not take the road which led to Magnart’s mansion,
but passed through a valley betwixt the green hills on
the further side of the lake and those rugged mountains
which overhrowcd them. Here he entered a cottage,
and exchanged a ﬁne jewel for a bow and quiver,.on
hearing the huntsman, to whom they belonged, describe
the sport which might he had, by an expert climber, in
shooting rock-goats on the Black Mountains. Over
those wild hills Phantasmion resolved to take his home-
ward way; he left Polyanthida, and leaped up the crags,
passing far above the valley of mines, and crossing the
whole of that mountain district, through which he had
already travelled, at a much quicker rate than when he
wound his way along the lower ridges and stony dells
with the ﬁsherman. The contents of a light case, which

he had replenished in the huntsman’s cottage, satisﬁed
his hunger, and, when that failed, he had recourse to the
conserve inclosed in his serpent wand. As he vaulted
from rock to rock many an ibex gazed at him with terri-
ﬁed eyes, and one, leaping down a precipice to get beyond
his reach, was dashed to pieces.
At last he gained the lofty Mount of Eagles, where
Iarine had been imprisoned among the crags. As he was
climbing more than half way toward the top, and had
turned away from gazing on the Black lake in the vale
below, he beheld a herd of rock goats in a hollow just
above him, and soon, one of the number quitting his
companions, placed himself at the edge of a jutting crag.
“ How like a child’s toy that creature looks!” thought
the prince, “ while he thus stands out against the wide
back-ground of the sky ! ” A moment afterward his
arrow whizzed through the air, but the ibex had leaped
from the crag, and there stood in his place a man with
a plumed crest, who had been ascending from the vale
of the Black Lake and had hitherto been hidden from
view by projecting rocks. The shaft would have hit his
forehead as he climbed the crag, had the air remained as
tranquil as before ; but a strong gust arose and made it
slant over the precipice, whence the ibex had leaped.
The plumed man made no pause but waved his hand
aloft, as if communing with some one in the air, and con-
tinued swiftly to ascend the hill.
Phantasmion hasting forward reached the topmost
peak of the mountain by the time that the sun had
descended, and, while he sought to obtain a view of his
own royal domain, beheld, on a peak over against him,
the man from whom his shaft had glanced aside. He

was of great size and stature, and wore a plume of glossy
white feathers which ﬂuttered in the gale, and now
shone, now glimmered, as the moon was visible by
snatches betwixt the hurrying clouds. Beside him stood
a woman’s form, with streaming dusky locks, which the
wind raised above her head, and she was pointing to the
sea, where it gleamed beyond the dark inland waters
like a cloudless part of the sky, and to some viessels off
the coast of Palmland. Suddenly she unfurled her wide
transparent wings, which had been lying motionless over
her shoulders, and ﬂoated away on the wind which blew
toward the Land of Rocks. “ This is Glandreth !” cried
Phantasmion ; “ I know that plumed crest ; and he hath
for his counsellor Oloola, the Spirit of the Blast !”
Gradually the wind diedaway, the moon shone brightly,
Phantasmion saw the ﬁgure of Oloola, like a white-winged
bird in the distance, and Glandreth intently surveying
that fair country which he hoped to make his own. The
youth knelt down, he set his arrow in the bow, and ﬁxed
his eye on Glandreth, who stood quite motionless absorbed
in contemplation.’ “ Now,” thought he, “ at this moment
could I lay him level with the earth, and his schemes
should fall with him.” Then he cried aloud, “ Nay, nay!
hereafter will I meet him face to face.” He was about
to rise, when a violent blast tore the bow and arrow out
of his hand, and, eddying round and round, lifted him
on high, then suffered him to fall upon the stony soil as
gently as a nurse can lay her infant charge upon a
carpeted ﬂoor. Phantasmion looked up and beheld a
speck in the heavens right over his head. It vanished
at the moment when Glandreth disappeared descending
the peak on the side toward the vale of the‘ Black Lake.

Returns to Palmland. I IO
The prince went on to ﬁnd a sheltered nook which
he had remembered seeing beside the shadowy tarn.
There he slept peaceably, forgetting Glandreth and
Oloola, and seeing only the angelic face of Iarine as it
looked when she beheld in hisarms the lost infant. At
dawn he descended the hill toward the Land of Palms,
and saw the sun light up the white sails of those pirate
vessels of which Glandreth had couimuned with Oloola.
He entered a herdsman's hut below the mountain, to
. obtain refreshments : here a damsel was sitting in com-
pany with a youth from the palace, and Phantasmion
heard them talk about a council which was to be holden
that day concerning the king's absence: so he induced
this page, who had never seen his face before, to lend
him his horse, and travelling at full speed he reached the
palace soon after the ancient men were assembled.
Not tarrying to change his wayworn garments he
entered the ha!l of state in the midst of a vehement
harangue; on catching the tenor of which he paused,
and held up his hand to those who had recognised him
to forbid their announcing his name. “ At this moment,”
said the speaker, “ Phantasmion is exploring the central
regions, or revelling in the sequestered caves of ocean, or
visiting the stars with some arch spirit; and there, no
doubt, he takes sage counsel, and learns thingsof deep
concernment to his realm upon earth.” Scarce had
these words fallen from his lips, when he perceived the
young monarch looking at him with a keen composed
countenance, while the other chiefs were full of perturba-
tion, as he stood betwixt himself and the throne.’ Then
all the assembly rose, the brother of Cyradis exclaiming,
“ Our king appears, and his gainsayers are put to silence :”

the presumptuous chief did homage with the rest of the
elders, and Phantasmion ascended the vacant throne.
Thence he addressed the council, relating all he had
learned during his absence which concerned the welfare
of his country, and appearing no more like him who till
then had been called the sovereign of Palmland, than a
tree full robed in leaf and blossom resembles the same
tree ere a bud is unfolded; for he was clothed with
majesty, and spoke like one who desired and deserved to
be a king.

CHAPTER XVI.
PHANTASMION nsscuss THE INFANT BROTHER or IARINE.
ON the evening of the day on which Phantasmion
returned to his palace, he conferred with Potentilla
beside the pomegranate tree, and, showing her the scroll
that fell from the silver pitcher, “What is this?” he
asked. The Fairy smiled disdainfully as she read
aloud, “A record of the agreement betwixt Seshelma
and Karadan, the son of Magnart." “ Seshelma !” ex-
claimed the youth; “ wherefore does she hate me, and
serve mine enemies?” “She hates thee,” replied
Potentilla, “because an ancestor of thine poisoned the
waters of a certain spring, and for the same cause she
will hate thy remotest descendants.” “But how is she
in league with Karadan?” inquired the prince; “is
she not Maudra’s servant?” Potentilla made answer:
“ Karadan may have offered some higher bribe, or per-
haps she only serves him out of wayward malice. Be
that as it may, Maudra is but the press that toils to
crush the fruit and keeps the empty skins alone, while
the juice ﬂows down below. ‘ I will bring poisonous
ﬁsh into the lake,’ Seshelma said to her; let Iarine
send them to the house of Magnart in Anthemmina’s
pitcher, which I brought thee from the ocean. So
thine enemies will perish, and the charmed vessel will
fall into the hand of the steward. But Glandreth will
scorn Iarine, believing that she has poisoned her own

~
kindred for the sake of that low-bor n favourite.’ This
plot she framed in order that Karadan might get P05‘
session of the charmed vessel; and how Maudra h8-8
been cheated concerning the ﬁsh thou thyself Well
knowest.” “ They caused sickness indeed,” cried the '
prince, “ but not death. Then it was the water-witch,"
he continued, “who brought Anthemmina’s pitcher from
the bottom of the sea?” Potentilla made no reply ‘£0
this question, and, when Phantasmion spoke of Oloola,
she trembled, and was silent. At length, however, she
said, “Be thou guided by me, and I will serve thee
against all thy foes without guerdon. Dorimant scorned
my words, and I left him to his fate.” So saying, the
Fairy ﬂew away in the form of a chafer, and the prince
fancied that he could distinguish her deep droning
sounds when ‘her form was hidden among the foliage.
It was now very dark, and Phantasmion returned t0 the
palace through groves and alleys, where the stars, shining
athwart the leafy boughs, appeared like funeral tapere-
“ How did my father perish !” thought the youth,
musing on the last words of Potentilla; “was it D011
surmised that he ate poisoned honey?” Phantasmieﬂ
shuddered: “Shall I seek aid," he said, “from beings
like these, freakish and sudden as children, yet steadfast
in revenge as the sternest of mankind.”
But when the young monarch arose with the sun
other thoughts possessed his soul. He remembered the.
pirate vessels which were plundering the fair plains Of
Palmland ; he conceived a project of driving them fI‘0111
the coast without delay; and, seeking the pomegranate
tree, exclaimed to Potentilla, at the moment she made
herself visible, “Once more give me wings! make 1119

able to ﬂy over the sea, and dive deep into its bosom !”
The Fairy touched him with her wand, and, in exchange
for his leaping powers, Phantasmion received those of a
water-beetle ; his body was cased in black mail, and he
was furnished with ample means of ﬂight. No sooner
was this work performed, and his head surmounted with
the crest and ﬁery eyes of a sea-dragon carved on a
helmet, than, having expanded his hard black upper
wings with sudden snap, and unfurled the soft
silvery pinions that lay beneath, till they stretched far
beyond their darkwing-cases, he ﬂew off to the ocean,
ﬁlling the air with a loud humming and droning, which,
when it mingled with the dash of waves below, produced
a noise like that of a great water-wheel. But, when
the wind sank, and the sea was‘ at perfect rest, he
descended and played upon its surface. As one that
slides on ice runs a few steps, and is then borne along
the crystal ﬂoor without exertion, so did Phantasmion,
in his new method of swimming, give a few strokes to
the water, then dart on smoothly over the waveless ﬂood,
while his jetty corslet now twinkled in the sun like
mother of pearl, now blackened suddenly, as if a shadow
had fallen upon it. Then down he dived, and walked
at the bottom of the sea as long as he could remain
there without taking breath. Having enjoyed enough
of this pastime, he went in seafch of the ships that were
plundering his subjects’ cattle. Espying one at a little
distance, he ﬂew towards it, plunged under water,
and came up close beside the vessel, the deck of which
was crowded with sheep and goats. Great was the
perplexity of the crew as they watched the winged
swimmer emerge from the deep : the dragon's head rose

ﬁrst, then came to view the curly locks, white brow, and
animated eyes of a fair youth, then those vast insect
pinions, and that strange coat of mail. A large net
was straightway brought by one of the sailors, but Phan-
tasmion rushed up into the air amid the roar of waters,
uttering loud threats and denunciations. He hovered
aloft, and made as if he would enter the ship, but the
crew, taking him for a demon sent to carry some of
them away into a place of torment, with one accord set
up a yell of terror; the captain, who had climbed the
mast, thence to survey the monster in the deep, bran-
dished his sword ; the sheep and goats huddled together,
one over the back of the other, and all the spears and
pitchforks which the men had used in their marauding
expeditions, were turned upward, so that the deck
bristled with iron points. Phantasmion wheeled sud-
denly round, and snatched away the sword of the cap~
tain, who, endeavouring to make a rapid retreat, tumbled
into the sea. The youth plunged after him, as an
osprey plunges after a ﬁsh, and would have landed him
on the deck of the vessel, but the sailors, stupiﬁed with
fright, remained in the same attitude as before, and the
serried spears were still held aloft to oppose his entrance.
Phantasmion therefore relaxed his grasp, and let the
captain fall back again into the water, then violently
shaking his wings, though not a particle of moisture
adhered to them, he soared away, having ﬁrst proclaimed
aloud that he should speedily return with his armed
legions to punish the plunderers. They did not await
the execution of the threat, but hastily the whole pirate
ﬂeet cleared the coast of Palmland, and, proceeding
along that of the adjacent realm, conveyed their booty
to the plains of Tigridia.

Meanwhile Phantasmion resolved to steer his course
towards the Black Lake, and to return home over the
Mount of Eagles. He held such a lofty course that his
form was not discernible from below; but, having
reached the Rockland shore, he desired to rest, and
softly alighted not far from the spot where he had ﬁrst
seen Seshelma and the consort of Albinian. A remem-
brance of that strange incident prompted him to approach
the low projecting cliff, and, leaning against it, to look
down into the cave. Having done this he started, for
there, on the same rock which she had formerly occupied,
sate the queen, with an infant asleep upon her lap.
The tide had reached the train of her long robe, and
was dashing it to and fro, but Maudra, heedless of
her sumptuous garment, gazed with looks of anguish on
the little child, which slumbered peacefully on her knee.
The sea was calm and glittered; but if a ﬁsh leaped up,
or a sea bird dipped into the water, a shuddering came
over her frame, and she looked upon the tranquil ocean
with a countenance of despair. A few tears trickled
from her eyes on the face of the infant, which started,
roused by their heat, then, breathing a soft sigh,
resigned itself again to sleep, while the breeze just
lifted up and down the delicate rings of ﬂaxen hair that
lay in clusters on its innocent head, and tinged with the
faint pink of May blossoms the upturned cheek, which
till then had been colourless, but round and lovely as a
. gleaming pearl. Maudra took the diadem from her
burning brow, and would have dashed it against the
rock, but checked herself through fear of awakening the
i sleeper, and let it fall on the soft bed of sand. Then,
in a low lulling tone, she sang these words :—


## p. 126 (#152) ############################################


I 2 6 P/zantasmion

O sleep, my babe, hear not the rippling wave,
Nor feel the breeze that round thee lingering strays
To drink thy balmy breath,
And sigh one long farewell.
Soon shall it mourn above thy wat’ry bed,
And whisper to me, on the wave-beat shore,
Deep murm’ring in reproach,
Thy sad untimely fate.
Ere those dear eyes had opened on the light,
' In vain to plead, thy coming life was sold,
O! wakened but to sleep,
Whence it can wake no more!
A thousand and a thousand silken leaves
The tufted beech unfolds in early spring,
All clad in tenderest green,
All of the self-same shape:
A thousand infant faces, soft and sweet,
Each year sends forth, yet every mother views
Her last not least beloved
Like its dear self alone.
No musing mind hath ever yet foreshaped
The face to-morrow’s sun shall ﬁrst reveal,
No heart hath e’er conceived
What love that face will bring.
O sleep, my babe, nor heed how mourns the gale
To part with thy soft locks and fragrant breath,
As when it deeply sighs
O’er autumn’s latest bloom.
But now Phantasmion’s heart begins to swell, and he
feels impatient of his strange disguise, for Iarine enters
the recess and fondly bends over the sleeping infant.
No sooner had Maudra looked upon that angel face than

her own assumed an expression of malignity, all her
worst passions being roused by the soft splendour of the
maiden’s beauty. She bade Iarine take the infant boy .
and walk with him close to the water, that he might be
refreshed by the mild sea breezes. “Soon I will join
thee,” she said, “ and Glandreth will come to conduct
us to the boat, and across the lake to the castle. Iarine
took the babe in her arms, but spite of all her care, he
opened his blue eyes, and, smiling on his mother,
encircled her ﬁnger, which she had holden up to enjoin
silence, in playful pertinacity with his fairy hand.
Iarine unclasped it, and, casting a look of wonder on the
agitated countenance of the queen, she hastily withdrew.
Till the damsel and her charge were out of sight, Maudra
stood ﬁxed and rigid, leaning against a rock; when they
were no longer visible from the cavern, her form collapsed,
and she sank upon the ground with closed eyes.
Phantasmion sprang into the air, and the sound of
his large pinions was like the whirring of an albatross.
He ﬂew over the sea—shore and hovered above the spot
where the damsel was pacing the sands. ' Iarine took
him for some large eagle, and held the child aloft to
show him the great bird which was wheeling about high
over head. Then with the rapidity of lightning he
slanted downward, and dived into the sea, his form
being rendered indistinguishable by the swiftness of his
ﬂight. Iarine was astonished, and stood waiting to
behold the strange bird reappear, while the baby pointed
to the place where it had rushed into the sea, and lay
back in the arms of his fair nurse, laughing merrily, and
believing that what he saw was a game of hide and seek,
carried on for his amusement. But Phantasmion has

caught sight of Seshelma lurking in the water, and now
he sees her dart onward, now emerge, and approach the
maiden. At that moment he rose from the waves, and,
before the extended arms of Seshelma had grasped their
prey, he had snatched it from the hands of Iarine, and,
violently spurning the face of the woman-ﬁsh with his
mail-cla.d foot, he soared aloft, and became as a speck in
the vault of heaven.
Before he winged his way homeward, Phantasmion
descended once more, to take a last look at the dis-
tressed Iarine. Poised on his outspread wings, he
beheld her with her heavenly face thrown upward, and her
white arms outstretched, as if she had forgotten all fear,
and were imploring him that had seized the infant to
restore it. Some one approaches her on the sandy
shore ; by his stately port and plume of waving
feathers, Phantasmion knows him to be Glandreth.
Iarine still gazes on the sky, and points to the hovering
youth. And now he beheld Maudra rushing across the ~
sands; she utters a loud shriek as she looks at the sky;
she tears her hair and ﬂings herself upon the ground;
then, arising, she hastens to the side of Glandreth,
points at Iarine, and seems to be accusing her to him.
The innocent maiden clasps her hands and still keeps
her eye on the infant.
Phantasmion dared tarry no longer ; he used his
wings vigorously, and scarcely paused till he had arrived
at the pomegranate tree, where he was divested, by
Potentilla, of his wings and other strange accoutrements.
He then carried the infant to his nurse, Leeliba, and
bade her bring him up with as much secresy as possible.
For the remainder of the day the child drooped like a

bird newly placed in a cage, and looked strangely on his
nurse when he awoke the next morning ; but, ere many
hours were over, he was smiling in the arms of the
youth who had twice preserved him from death, and
seemed ready to spring away, and catch the wild colt,
which the attendants brought to gambol for his amuse-
ment.

CHAPTER XVII.
PHANTASMION MEETS WITH IARINE AND ALBINET ON THE
BANKS OF THE BLACK LAKE.
PHANTASMION again sought an interview with the fairy,
and told her that he desired above all things to win the
heart of Iarine, and to confound his enemy Glandreth.
Potentilla replied, “ Go then to the Black Lake, offer thy-
self as cup-bearer to Queen Maudra, and with my aid
thou shalt accomplish both these projects.” Having
spoken thus she turned to the bough of a plane tree,
where a cicada was pertinaciously chirping, as if it
would bear a part in the discourse. She touched the
insect, and it gradually expanded to a vast magnitude,
while the sound of its drum grew rapidly louder and
louder, till at last it seemed about to split, with its
vibrations, the broad trunk and stout arms of the tree
on which it stood. Phantasmion exclaimed, “ With such
an instrument as this I might roam at night through
the forests, and make the wild beasts ﬂy on all sides.”
“ Ay,” replied Potentilla, “ and with an instrument like
this thou shalt terrify the soul of Glandreth; for I will
whisper such a warning in his ear that when he hears
th at sound, he shall believe his last hour to be at hand.”
Yhantasmion embraced the‘ fairy’s scheme with ardour,
feeling conﬁdent that he should not fail in executing
his part of it. Potentilla placed the drum in the fore-

part of his body, and showed him by what slight imper-
ceptible motions he might draw forth the full powers
of the instrument; then, removing her wand to his
shoulders, she endued them with wings that might be
closely folded down lengthwise, and concealed beneath
his loose upper vest.
Having entrusted the affairs of his kingdom to the
brother of Cyradis, and the royal scion to that of his
ancient nurse, he attired himself in garments denoting
the ofﬁce he meant to assume; they were embroidered
at the edge with green vine leaves and clusters of purple
grapes. Thus equipped he set forth, ﬂying many a
leaguetill he reached the valley of the Black Lake, and
stayed to rest on a large tree where he was hidden by
the abundant foliage. When he arrived at this station,
the King’s Island, and the whole sheet of water in
which it stood, was wrapped in a thick fog, only the
edge of the lake being visible beyond the vapoury cur-
tain, like a rim of lurid steel. Phantasmion looked out-
from amid the boughs, and, after a time, began to
perceive a small ghost-like vessel advancing through
the mist. It contained two ﬁgures, faint and shadowy,
a young boy moving the oars, and, standing beside him,
a damsel clad in white robes, and wearing a crown of
star-shaped azure lilies, which gleamed within the misty
veil. Slowly the boat made way, gradually the ﬁgures
grew in distinctness, and, as the lake looked clearer, and
the radiant face of Iarine came closer, it seemed to the
prince that she, and not the dull red orb on high, was
pouring brightness through the sullen mist. Young
Albinet, now weary of his task, resigned the oars :
skilfully the maiden drew the boat to land, then leaping

‘ on the shore she held up both her arms of gleaming
whiteness, and lifted the lame child out of the boat.
“ Sister," said the boy, “ thou wast kind to come with
me when nobody else would venture out. The ﬁnest
summer days often begin thus. Let us sit down here
and see the white curtain draw up from the lake."
Iarine seated herself beside young Albinet on a bank
below the tree where Phantasmion was concealed, and
soon the child began to amuse himself with plucking
purple ﬂags, and sticking the blossoms all about her
dress, and here and there amid the labyrinth of her
locks. Now he would lift up those tresses, and spread
them abroad in the faint sunshine, till they glittered
like a tissue of golden threads, now heap them together
in full masses, which looked as deep and mellow as rich
wine in the cask. “ Sister,” said the child, “ why wilt
thou always wear those cold blue water lilies? Red
and yellow ﬂowers are livelier than blue ones.” “ I
love them because my mother loved them,” said Iarine.
“ Dost thou think she wears such a crown as this now?”
said Albinet, softly, looking up at the sky. “ The
ﬂowers she wears,” replied the maiden, “are such as
will never fade.” “Heaven must be very full of ﬂowers,”
cried he, “if new ones come and yet the old ones never
go away. I hope it is not like that picture of a sunny
garden which never changes; I hope there are half
opened buds in heaven, Iarine, and merry milk white
lambs,” “Heaven is happiness,” the maid replied;
“all that can make us happy we shall meet with there.”
“ I wish,” said Albinet, with a sigh, “ that we could get
thither without going down into the dark grave. Is
there no lightsome road to heaven, up in the open air "'

“ My mother never went into the grave’; said Iarine,
“ she was buried in the waves of the sea.” “ O, from
the sea,” said Albinet, “it must be easy enough to
climb up into the sky, for I myself have marked the
very place where it meets the water. When this fog
clears away, if I could get to the top of that tree, and
look intently, perchance I‘ might descry some very
minute trace of the beginning of heaven. Dear Iarine,
these are no heavenly ﬂowers, for they are drooping
already: I will throw them into the lake to send away
the fog.” So saying, he pulled the chaplet from his
sister’s brow, and ﬂung it into the water, when a large
dark bird suddenly rose from one of the craggy islets,
and rushed onward, appearing vast and indistinct as it
loomed through the mist. Albinet shrieked aloud, and
fell upon the ground writhing; Iarine hung over him
tenderly, and, when he recovered, she pointed to the
dark bird, which now stood on the shore in full view.
“ There is the goblin,” she said; “ no goblins but such
as that will ever come near thee and me.” The pale
boy smiled, ' and, hiding his face in his sister’s lap,
entreated her to soothe him for a while with one of her
soft melodies, and, while the fog was rapidly dispersing,
she sang words like these :—
How gladsome is a child, and how perfect is his mirth,
How brilliant to his eye are the daylight shows of earth!
But Oh! how black and strange are the shadows in his sight,
What phantoms hover round him in the darkness of the night!
Away, ye gloomy visions, I charge ye hence away,
Nor scare the simple heart that without ye were so gay;
Alas! when you are gone with all your ghastly crew,
What sights of glowing splendour will fade away with you!

He’ll see the gloomy sky, and know 'tis here decreed,
That sunshine follow every storm, and light to shade succeed,
No more he’11 dread the tempest, nor tremble in the dark,
Nor soar on wings of fancy far beyond the soaring lark.
I love thee, little brother, when smiles are on thy face, ‘
I love thy eager merriment, thy never failing grace:
But when the shadow darkens thee and chills thy timid breast,
Pd watch from eve till day-break that thou might‘st be at rest.
“ I dreamt that we were in the grave,” said Albinet,
roused by his sister from sobbing sleep ; “ and I began
to cry: but, behold, it ‘was only a passage, and there
was light at the other end.” “ What have we to do
with the grave '1" said Iarine, in a sprightly tone: “we
can never be laid under ground, only our worn garments.
The earth is nature's wardrobe; for out of it every
living thing and every tree and plant receive apparel.
Ere we go hence we must replace our garments in the
great receptacle, that the old materials may serve to make
new clothes for other creatures.” Albinet looked at his
pining limb: “I will have ﬁner clothes than these in
heaven,” he said, “ and such as ﬁt me better.” “ Think of
our garden favourite,” said the maid again ;_ “ when the
streaked petals and shining leaves and upright stem all
disappeared, was the dear lily dead? ‘No, no,’ she '
might have cried from under ground, ‘though all you
ever saw me has gone to dust, yet I am still alive, and
soon shall have fresh raiment ﬁt to appear in; unless ,-
I!’
the spring proves faithless. Albinet clasped his sister’s;'/
hand joyfully: “ We too shall be fresh clothed,” he'_
cried, “ and better clothed, because our spring will be in
a far ﬁner soil and climate. Ha, ha'! who knows but
these bodies of ours may be the bulbs out of which our
1

heavenly bodies are to spring, as that caterpillar is
the bulb of a butterﬂy, and the poor dry acorn of a
branching oak ?"
Then full of smiles he ran away to gather blossoms
that grew in the lake, the vapours having all cleared off;
but soon returning, “ Sister,” he cried, “ I cannot reach
the queen of the whole company; pray come and lend
a hand.” Iarine had begun_ to read a letter with
deep attention, yet now she rose, and placing stones in
the water, erected a little bridge to the ﬂoating colony of
ﬂowers. But just as she was about to gather one, Albinet
screamed aloud, for he had heard the sound of the
magical drum, which the prince struck against the
branch of a tree in bending forward to look at Iarine.
The maid was startled, her foot slipped from the stone,
and, looking up, she beheld Phantasmion, with light
wings unfurled, gazing at her from the middle of a broad
leafy bpugh. She knew his face, and remembering
how strangely it had appeared to her twice before, she
believed the youth was some wizard or guileful spirit,
and springing to the bank and catching hold of her little
brother, she hastened away as fast as his feeble limbs
would allow him to keep pace with her. Phantasmion
lightly ﬂuttered down from the tree, and, fanning the
air with his delicate pinions, quickly overtook Iarine
and the terriﬁed child. At that instant he lowered his
wings, folding them down over his shoulder, and kneeling
before the princess, held out a cup to show what oﬂice
he sought, and intreated her to favour his suit with the
queen. Albinet clasped his sister round the waist, and
hid his face, that he might not see the object which
excited his terror; but the fears of Iarine almost melted

I 36 P/zantasmzbn
away while Phantasmion spoke, and looking at his
noble countenance, she could not but yield to the faith
which it inspired. “ I cannot speak for queen Maudra,”
she replied, “ but thou shalt be conducted to her pre-
sence and mayst have an answer from herself.” She
then returned with young Albinet to the boat, which
she had over-passed in her sudden alarm, and was soon
on her way to the island. Phantasmion went to gather
up the ﬂower which had fallen from her hand into the
lake, and, at the same time, espied the letter ﬂoating by
its side. The name of Semiro and that of Karadan
caught his eye as it lay open before him, and guessing
that it came from Zelneth, he read what follows while
he waited for the boat from the island:—“ Beware of
him, dearest Iarine, for it is reported that he deals in
magic; yes, powerful magic, and I believe the charge.
Our house has never seemed like itself since he entered
it ; Karadan is more despairing than ever, and Leucoia
grieves twice as much for her lost love as she did before
the enchanter came among us. She seems to have sat
too long in the sun; her cheeks are like a bleached
primrose born near midsummer. And oh ! what a sun-
bright visage beamed on us lately !
“ My cousin, beware of him, if he comes into thy
presence; be not deceived by his heavenly brow, nor
his noble countenance, nor his deep sweet voice, nor his
gallant bearing: above all, be not deluded by his smile :
that smile I know to be his most pernicious spell. It
banishes all natural smiles from the place where it has
once appeared; it is a light that puts out all other
lights, and, vanishing, leaves darkness behind it.
“ Our father avers that Semiro was no envoy from

Palmland, but a spy sent by Glandreth. Oh folly!
Semiro never came from any dominions but his own,
whether they be of earth or of some other sphere.
Arzene is wroth with him, for the sake of her dear son :
that he sought Karadan’s blood, I believe not ;'but if he
seeks to rob him of that which he values more, thy love,
he does far worse. I beseech thee let him not succeed
in this, Iarine ; let him not work spells on thee, as thou
valuest thy good name. I grieve that any suspicion
should rest on that ; but strange rumours will ﬂy abroad
unless thou hearkenest to the suit of Karadan. Pity
indeed should incline thee to this; better have nipped
his passion in the bud, than suffer the ﬂower to
blow in vain, wasting the precious juices of the tree.
I could not act thus cruelly, even toward a wicked sor-
cerer, if I were loved by him as thou art by Karadan.
Alas ! no one, whose love I care for, will ever love me
thus; yet, loved or unloved, I remain thy loving cousin,
Zelneth.”

CHAPTER XVIII.
PHANTASMION MAKES USE OF HIS MAGICAL DRUM.
PHANTASMION thanked Zelneth in his heart for that
warning letter, which seemed so well ﬁtted to defeat its
own purpose, and by the time that a boat bad arrived to
transport him whither his heart was bound, he had con-
cealed his wings under a cloak, and every aspiring
thought under a countenance of humility and reserve.
The queen, when she beheld him, was pleased with the
opportunity of engaging so handsome a cup-bearer, and,
being engrossed with the image of Glandreth, observed
no beauty in him which might not belong to men of
lowly station. “He looks sedate yet quick,” thought
she; “ I may ﬁnd him the more useful; at all events he
~ will be a goodly piece of furniture, becoming a palace.”
That day a high feast was holden, at the castle, and
Phantasmion attended in his place amid the crowd of
domestic servants. He placed himself right opposite to
Glandreth, and read his face more keenly than any one
at the board. He saw the courtier bend forward to
address the queen with soft volubility, prolonged smile,
and gently suspended eyelid, then, absolving himself
from the mimic task, on a sudden resume his lofty port
and natural countenance, every smile gone, every muscle
braced up, and none but stern thoughts legible on his
brow. ‘ At one end of the table sate poor Albinian, the

mock eﬁigy of a king, his white locks incessantly shaken
by the palsied motions of his head. Now and then he
muttered a few words which no one tried to understand
but Iarine ; she, brightest and loveliest, sate beside him,
devoting all her looks and words to the afﬂicted man;
but from her heavenly face he turned away, by a miser-
able fascination, to watch his gaudy queen and the proud
injurious noble. Phantasmion could see his eye ﬂash
and his teeth chatter with impotent rage, when others
perceived none but the twitches of disease in that dis-
torted face. And now Glandreth has ﬁxed his ardent
eye upon the beautiful princess; but silent reproaches,
deeper than any but an angel face could have expressed,
were all her answer, and looking back to Maudra he
spied suspicion on her lowering brow. He refrained
from casting another glance upon Iarine, and renewed
his discourse to the queen, leaning forward and address-
_ing her with all the tender conﬁdence of a favourite:
“Last night I had the strangest dream,” said he; ‘'‘ ’tis
well I have few fears;” then dropping his voice, and
looking expressly at Maudra, he added, “ there is but
one being on earth who.holds me in awe.” “ Tell me
thy dream,” answered the queen with a smile; ' “ I did
not think thou hadst been a dreamer; but the dreams
of some are worth more than the waking thoughts of
others." “I dreamed,” said he, “ that I heard a thun-
dering sound, which gradually grew louder and louder,
till I thought it would shatter myself and ‘all around me
with its violence. I started from my couch, expecting,
forsooth, to be swallowed up by an earthquake; but all
was still and silent; I lay down to sleep, and had no.

into my ear: ‘ Glandreth, when thou hearest that sound
again, prepare to die.’ ” Maudra listened to this story
with a face full of smiles, believing that it was a feigned
tale, intended to elicit from her some mark of favour. V
She poured out a cup of sparkling wine, and bade Phan-
tasmion present it to Glandreth. “Long mayst thou
live,” she cried, “ and never cease to prosper till dreams
like these become true prophecies!” When that service
was performed, the graceful cup-bearer took his station
behind the noble guest, and, just as he was raising the
wine-cup to his lips, having answered the queen’s pledge,
Phantasmion produced a long, loud, swelling peal from
his gong, which vibrated across the back of Glandreth’s
stately chair through every ﬁbre of his frame, and caused
him to spill the contents of the goblet into his bosom.
The queen started from her seat with clasped hands, and
the whole company were full of amazement. Is that an
idiot smile which distends Albinian’s face, while he stares
upon Glandreth ?—to Phantasmion it seemed the ex-
pression of gratiﬁed hatred. Meantime the proud chief
sate trembling, and vainly strove to recover the careless
air with which he had related his dream. But _Phan-
tasmion perceived that'the soft eyes of Iarine were bent
on him with a regretful look, that seemed to say, “ Zel-
neth speaks truly ; that beaming face and princely aspect
are the disguise of a sorcerer.” No one else appeared to
guess whence the sounds had proceeded; most of the
company had listened to the story of the dream; they
cast unpiteous glances on the haughty warrior, and all
agreed with one consent that the noise they heard could
never have been produced by any instrument which the
hand of man had fashioned. Glandreth frowned, and it

seemed doubtful whether alarm or anger spoke loudest
in his heart.
Phantasmion retired among the domestics, and, wander-
ing, while day declined, through the woods on the island,
he espied, between the foliage, a twinkling light upon
the lake. He uncovered his wings, ﬂew up to a tree,
and, looking down upon the gleaming pebbles of the
shore in the clear moonlight, espied the dark face of
Karadan, who, at that moment, was leaning on a pole,
in the act of bringing his boat to land In a few
moments he took up the silver pitcher, leaped upon the
shore, and looked and listened, as if expecting some one
from the castle ; then he seated himself on a turfy bank,
just below the prince, and while he embraced the charmed
vessel, softly murmured these words :-—
I tremble when with look benign
Thou tak’st my ofEer’d hand in thine,
Lest passion-breathing words of mine
The charm should break:
And friendly smiles be forced to ﬂy,
Like soft reﬂections of the sky,
Which, when rude gales are sweeping by,
Desert the lake.
Of late I saw thee in a dream;
The day-star pour-‘d his hottest beam,
And thou, a cool refreshing stream,
Did'st brightly run:
The trees where thou wert pleased to ﬂow,
Threw out their ﬂowers, a glorious show,
While I, too distant doomed to grow,
Pined in the sun.

By no life-giving moisture fed,
A wasted tree, I bow’d my head,
My sallow leaves and blossoms shed
On earth’s green breast:
And silent pray’d the slumbering wind,
The lake, thy tarrying place, might ﬁnd,
And waft my leaves, with breathings kind,
There, there, to rest.
Phantasmion had now taken his resolution; he was
about to spring from his place of concealment and con-
tend with Karadan for the pitcher, but his motions were
suddenly arrested, when he beheld Iarine, clad in ﬂowing
garments as she sate at the feast, advance through the
trees to meet the son of Magnart, and he then became
all eagerness to hear what discourse would follow between
them. 4 His heart began to sink, and he felt more
alarmed for the success of his hopes than he had ever
done since he ﬁrst beheld Iarine.
The dark youth threw himself on his knees before
the princess, and laid hold of her robe, as if to secure
her stay till he had gained courage to speak. “ Kara-
dan,” said the maiden, “I received thy message; say
quickly what thou hast to tell me, for I have little time
to tarry here.”. “Iarine,” said the youth, “I have a
relic in my possession which once belonged to thy
mother.” “ Dear cousin,” replied she, “hast thou come
thus far to gratify that fond wish of my heart? Give
me the relic, and I will bless thee for ever.” “Thou
canst indeed bless me for ever,” exclaimed the youth,
fervently, “ but not with words alone, dear as thy Words
have ever been to me.‘ Oh let deeds. follow, or thy
gentlest words will come in vain, as the dew falls on

plants that waste inwardly, having a worm at the core.’

Y
“ Nay, Karadan, speak not thus; ” answered the maiden,
“thou hast no worm at the core, but a sound heart, a
gallant heart, which will carry thee through a thousand
noble enterprises.‘” “O lady, sweet cousin,” cried the
youth, “ my grief is a jest to thee. If thou couldst,un-
derstand but half the intensity of my anguish, I know
that, out of tenderness and compassion, thou wouldst
learn to love me.” “ Not as thou desirest, Karadan ; ”
replied the maid; “ why wouldst thou force me to pro-
mise what 1 never can perform?” “If thou hadst
i promised to love me,” answered Karadan, eagerly, “ even
that thou couldst perform. Virtue and kindliness are
thy very being, thy every thought and feeling is in-
formed by them. Promise that thou wilt try to love
me, and I will go hence the happiest man that ever
loved and hoped. That sky, which lately looked so bare
and void, now shines with multitudes of stars; and bar-
ren plains, which seem to have no germs of life within
them, how soon are they covered with ﬂourishing herbs
and groves where the birds nestle! Only try to love
me, and thy heart, sweet lady, will prove as great a
change as this.” “Dear cousin,” answered the maid,
f‘ we have duties enough which nature imposes; for a
heart like mine I am sure they are suﬂicient; never
let us make a duty of love.” A change came over
Karadan’s face, and his eye shot ﬁre, as he exclaimed,
“ Thou art more than usually resolute! perchance thou
hast seen a youth from Palmland.” Iarine was silent.
“Yes, yes!” pursued Karadan with vehemence, “a
youth like the sun, as my sister blazons him; to thee,
no doubt, he seems not less radiant. Oh, he is the

rising sun, and I the gloomy night that must retire
when he approaches!” “ Give me the relic, good
cousin,” replied the maid, “and I will show favour to no
youth from Palmland.” Karadan seized the pitcher,
and holding it up, he exclaimed, “Tell him that I have
the charmed vessel on which thy fate depends. Tell
him that thou thyself hast made it mine: tell him that
I will hide it where it shall never more be found, and
then let him ﬁght with me till one or both of us perish!"
Karadan pressed the pitcher close to his bosom, while his
countenance this moment seemed glowing with passion,
the next, darkening in despair. Phantasmion again pre-
pared to spring forward, and challenge him for the
pitcher, but restrained himself once more when he be-
held Glandreth emerge from the shady wood, into the
clear moonlight which gleamed upon the lake and pebbly
' shore. On espying the youth and the maid he suddenly
stopped, holding up his hand, as if in astonishment.
“Iarine!” exclaimed he, “ the princess Iarine! Fair
lady, let me lead thee to the castle ;_ thou art looked for
by the queen: she would wonder indeed to see thee in
such company at such an hour.” At these words, Kara-
dan, whose face Glandreth had not yet seen, rushed for-
ward. “Proud man !” he cried, “my kinswoman owes
thee no explanation : my father is her natural guardian,
and not thou." “ What, Karadan!" exclaimed Gland-
reth, “ Hast thou ventured hither? Hence, and bear
my deﬁance to Magnart.” “I will bear no message
from thee,” replied the youth: “ I have a sword here,
and can stand in my father’s place.” “Hast thou a
life to spare, mad youth? " replied Glandreth, contemp-
tuously. “Away! when I am in second childhood I

will ﬁght with theel ” “I have a life to spare!” vo-
ciferated Karadan: “Do I not know thy wickedness
against the mother of Iarine? Art thou not in my
power? Glandreth approached Karadan, who was
trembling with passion, and bending down his hand,
which held the sword with a mighty grasp, he pointed
to the sky, while, in deep low tones, he murmured,
“Rash Karadan, look yonder! Hast thou forgotten
that form?” Phantasmion and the son of Magnart
both raised their eyes to the sky, and beheld the dim
outline of a winged ﬁgure, with the hand outstretched,
and pointing to Karadan, while from that outstretched
hand lightnings appeared to radiate in quivering lines
along the starry vault, at the same time a shuddering
passed across the lake, and over all the woods in which
it was embosomed. Like a stranded vessel, that, after
tossing in violent agitation, runs aground upon rocks,
Karadan sank silently to the earth, Iarine covered her
face with her hands, and even Phantasmion’s heart was
chilled with fear. He still gazed upward, and observed
the form grow fainter and fainter, till it ﬁnally vanished;
Karadan, too raised his drooping head, and saw Glan-
dreth seize both hands of the fair princess, and smile
triumphantly in her face. Then, forgetting everything
but vengeance, he sprang to his feet, and dashed the
silver pitcher against the forehead of the insulting
chieftain: at that same moment the Isle resounded, and
all the distant hills re-echoed the tremendous roar of the
magical drum, during the reverberations of which, Phan-
tasmion leaped forward, full of life, hope, and energy,
feeling ready to encounter a world in arms.

powered by the terriﬁc sounds, which he believed to be
the heralds of his death, lay motionless on the shore,
his face streaming with blood. The dark youth gazed
in perturbation upon the young king of Palmland.
“Sorcerer!” at length he exclaimed, “wilt thou come
betwixt me and my foe with spells and witcheries?”
“I am no sorcerer!” cried Phantasmion, glowing with
indignation; “ but it is the most ﬁendish of all that
practice sorcery in whom thou puttest thy trust! How
speaks ‘the Record betwixt Seshelma and Karadan, son
of Magnart?” “How came that Record into thy
hands, thou robber?” Karadan retorted—“Didst thou
not attempt to steal this vessel which I purchased with
my own gold '1” “ Thou shalt purchase it with steel as
well as with gold,” cried Phantasmion, drawing his sword,
“come on, there is light enough here to ﬁght by.”
Karadan ﬂung the pitcher into the boat, and beckoned
his antagonist to a ﬁrm space of smooth turf, clear
from trees; there they fought in the moonlight, guiding
their weapons with deadly resolution,--Phantasmion
inspired by hope as well as love and courage, Karadan
with no ally to second those feelings but despair. The
calm lake reﬂected their bright blades, hard by the
image of the waning moon, which lay motionless on its
bosom. Iarine ﬂed to the castle, and soon the com-
batants heard earnest voices and hurrying footsteps of
persons who came to separate them. Both paused at
once. “ Let us meet again!” cried Phantasmion ; here
is my pledge!” and throwing his mantle, which lay
upon the ground, on the arm of Karadan, he plunged
into the depths of the wood, while his adversary leaped
into the boat, made it skim round the Island, and was

out of sight from that part of the shore when the armed
men reached it. The soldiers sought about, and found
no one but Glandreth, who was just roused from his
swoon, and sat upright, gazing around him with blood-
stained face and looks of bewildered fury.

CHAPTER XIX.
GLANDRETH IS MORE THAN EVER AMAZED AND DISCOM-
FITED BY THE NOISE OF THE MAGIC DRUM.
PHANTASMION stole away through the woods till he came
into the midst of a jovial company who were carous-
ing in the open air. These were the pages and other
servants of the royal household; they had heard the
awful voice of the gong, and were making haste to drown
their fears in wine. “ The mighty general,” they cried,
“ who dreams only of war and conquest, how sober he
looked at that spirit-quelling sound !” “ Did ye mark,”
said one, “ how Queen Maudra started from her chair;
there was little sobriety in her demeanour, I trow.”
“Now I warrant,” cried a saucy page, after having
renewed his courage with a deep draught, “while she is
planting arbours, entwined with passion ﬂowers and
jessamine, wherein to enjoy the converse of Glandreth,
when Albinian lies low, he has been looking out for a
stronghold on the frontiers, where he may keep her
under garrison as far ﬁ'om his palace of pleasure as
possible.” “ One good thing will come to pass in those
days,” cried another; “Iarine will be queen instead of
Maudra.” “Hurra! hurra!” shouted the revellers:
“ The moon shall be queen in heaven, and bright Iarine
upon earth.” “Hush, hush !” ejaculated an old wine
bibber, who was lying under the rose bushes, “let the

moon hear nothing about it yet, nor Maudra either, but
mark my words,”—here a burst of merriment drowned
his sage discourse, but when the uproar had subsided he
raised his ﬂushed face among the pure cool roses, and
stammered out, “ Depend on it that young Iarine would
rather drink the waters of the sea than marry that
wicked miner and underminer, who caused Anthemmina
to drink them.” “ When Albinian dies,” cried a
sprightly page, “the heads of the land shall all be
young and handsome. None but a ﬁt spouse for Iarine
shall be our king.” The revellers cast their eyes on
Phantasmion. “Come,” said one, “ take this ﬁne
fellow, pour some royal blood into his veins, and he
shall be the man.” Thereupon they crowded round the
prince, placed a chaplet on his brow, and made him
drink out of many a sparkling bowl, till he caught their
spirit, and joined them in a blithe chorus after this
sort :-—
Ne’er ask where knaves are mining,
While the nectar plants are twining:
To pull up the vine
They never incline,
With all their deep designing.
O, ne’er for the dead sit weeping,
Their graves the dews are steeping ;
And founts of mirth
Spring up from the earth,
Where they are at peace and sleeping.
Away with studious learning,
When heaven’s bright lamps are burning:
In the glorious art
That gladdens the heart,
We cannot be more discerning.

Forget the blood that gushes
Where the ﬁery war-horse rushes:
The blood that glows,
As it brightly ﬂows,
Is making us chant like thrushes.
When burdened troops advancing,
In cumbrous mail are glancing,
With garlands crowned
We reel around,
While the earth and sky are dancing.
Phantasmion escaped from this boon company, and,
having entered the castle, espied Glandreth and the
queen communing together in a vaulted passage. The
chieftain bent his head, and slowly retired to his chamber ;
but Maudra beckoned to Phantasmion, and bade him
keep watch in the balcony adjoining Glandreth’s apart-
ment, that he might render assistance to the wounded
warrior in the night if it were needed. The prince
obeyed this order with alacrity ; he crept to the appointed
station, displaced a party of bats, and looked down on his
late comrades, most of whom had now fallen asleep
among their cups. Glandreth was neither drinking nor
sleeping, but drawing a chart of Palmland ; with his face
bent over the table, he had lifted up his pen to mark the
very spot where his invading host was to enter the
country, at that same point of time when the young
monarch, pressing his drum close to the wall, produced
an indescribable and intolerable din, which not only
made the apartment of Glandreth rock and resound like
a belfry, but circulated around the castle, till every
dome, and tower, and vault, rang again, and the whole
ediﬁce appeared to be a sounding cymbal in the hand of

some mighty musician. Phantasmion crouched down,
and, peeping through the rails of the balcony, was
amused to see that the whole party' of sleepers, lately
scattered up and down among the bushes, had started to
their feet, and were all standing in one attitude, every
head thrown back, every right arm upraised, while
rooks, bats, owls, and swallows, day birds and night
birds, were ﬂying about in confusion, and the howling
of dogs, from various quarters of the island, sounded as
if an enemy had entered the precincts.
After having observed the effects produced without
the castle for a little time, the prince resolved to enter
Glandreth’s chamber, under pretence of obeying Maudra’s
command. Accordingly, stealing in from the balcony he
found all as still as death. He advanced farther into
the apartment, 'and beheld the strong man lying upon
the ﬂoor, his eyes ﬁxed, his cheeks livid, and the wound
upon his forehead sending forth a fresh stream of blood.
Maudra knelt beside him, with a pale, horror-stricken
face : a lamp, which had fallen from her hand, lay burn-
ing on the ﬂoor, and cast a lurid gleam on the blotted
map just beside it, and on those two ghastly visages,
while the moon’s milder light admitted through the
window, illumined the rose-crowned head of 'the royal
youth, and his light, half-raised wings, from which his
upper vest had slipped aside.
Maudra was too much absorbed to observe Phantas-
mion ; he glided away, and, passing into another part of
the castle, where a lamp shone from the roof, he beheld
Albinian standing outside his chamber door, with a wild
exultation in his blear eyes. On seeing Phantasmion,
he began eagerly to mutter and gesticulate, pointing

along the passage, as if to inquire what had become of
Maudra. The youth was too wary to throw light upon
this subject, but making a low obeisance, hastened on,
and entered a gloomy passage into which a feeble light
was shining from a window at one end: and now he
heard soft irregular steps approaching; some one, little
and light, ran against him; by an involuntary motion he
erected his gauzy wings, which caught the faint rays
from the high window, while the rest of his ﬁgure was
shadowy and obscure. A shrill scream pierced those dark-
some recesses, then a door opened at a little distance, and,
swift as a coney hies to his hole in the rock, young
Albinet, with his bare feet and loose vest, hurried into
Iarine’s unlighted chamber. Phantasmion stood at the
door, and between the pauses of the boy's eager story,
uttered amidst loud sobs, he heard her soothing tones
and mild remonstrances. “ Let me stay here,” said the
child at length. “ I am happy even in the dark when
close to thee. But O, sister, would that we lived where
there is no night for almost half the year! In those
lands, when the sun does set, a throng of purple meteors
play his part in the sky. The very ground too is
luminous, and reﬂects the moonbeams from its snowy
surface.” “Those lands have more light than heat,”
said Iarine ; “ thou dost not love the cold.” “ In heaven
there will be neither cold nor darkness,” he answered,
after a pause; “ but, alas ! now I think on it, up in the
sky we shall be close to the dreadful thunder, and there
it will sound as loud as that terrible din which is bellow-
ing in my ears even yet.” “Thunder comes from the
clouds ;” the maid replied, “ our dwelling will be far
beyond theclouds that frown upon this earth. There

will be no vexing noises, no dull silence, no shade but
the shadows of bright blossomed trees with sunshine all
round about them. But sleep, now—” “ O, sleep is
scared away for ever,” sighed Albinet ; “ never, never to
come nigh these walls again!” A few moments after-
wards Phantasmion heard the soft, regular breathing,
which told that his fearful spirit had ceased to strive
with itself ; then, having laid himself down beside that
chamber-door, he too fell asleep, and dreamed right
pleasantly.

GLANDRETH QUIT-S THE ISLAND, AND PHANTASMION
OBTAINS AN INTERVIEW WITH IARINE.
WHEN Phantasmion awoke in the dim passage, he
heard the inmates of the chamber greeting the dawn
with this song :-—-
How high yon lark is heavenward borne !
Yet, ere again she hails the morn,
Beyond where birds can wing their way
Our souls may soar to endless day,
May hear the heavenly choirs rejoice,
While earth still echoes to her voice.
A waveless ﬂood, supremely bright,
Has drown’d the myriad isles of light;
But ere that ocean ebb’d away,
The shadowy gulf their forms betray :
Above the stars our course may run,
’Mid beams unborrow’d from the sun.
In this day’s light what ﬂowers will bloom,
What insects quit the self-made womb!
But ere the bud its leaves unfold,
The gorgeous ﬂy his plumes of gold,
On fairer wings we too may glide,
Where youth and joy no ills betide.

Then come, while yet we linger here,
Fit thoughts for that celestial sphere,
A heart which under keenest light,
May bear the gaze of spirits bright,
Who all things know, and nought endure
That is not holy, just and pure.
“ Now for fresh thoughts and fresh deeds!" cried
the youth, starting up, when the strain ceased, and
doﬂing his withered chaplet; but ere these glowing
resolves had taken any ﬁxed gshape, forth came Iarine,
hand in hand with Albinet, throwing light from the
chamber full in his face : then starting at the sight of
him, she hurried away, and soon had entered Maudra’s
apartment. Phantasmion stood in a recess, and in a
little time, the young boy, going out on some errand,
left the door ajar, so that he now beheld the interior
of the apartment, where Iarine was dressing the queen’s
hair, and beheld her lovely form as she bent over the
task, and her face reﬂected in the mirror above that of
Maudra. The step-dame surveyed her own too faithful
portrait, and the more she gazed, the more she was dis-
satisﬁed with those bleak remains of pristine splendour.
A deeper shade seemed to fall over her sunken eyes,
and the hollows that lay beneath them, so that the
reﬂection, and that which was reﬂected, mutually
increased each other’s gloom; while the soft image of
Iarine’s unconscious face beamed on in pensive beauty.
Maudra pulled away her dishevelled locks from the lily
hand that held them, and, scowling upon the maiden, ‘
said, “ Thy tresses are too thick, Iarine: no wonder
my work stands still, when thou hast such a multitude
of gadding tendrils to cultivate : if thou wert a child of

mine I should have them pruned much closer.” The
damsel understood this hint, and, while her tears fell
fast, cut one after another of her sunny ringlets, and let
them fall upon the ground, while Maudra looked sternly
on, and never seemed to think that she had done
enough. Phantasmion’s blood was rising. Albinet, at
this moment ran back into his mother’s room, and see-
ing what Iarine was about, stopped short in his career.
Then, looking greatly astonished, he held her hand, and
plaintively inquired, “What! art thou shearing away all
thy locks which our poor father loves to play with ?"
Iarine whispered, “ Hush! it is by the queen's com-
mand.” Upon which Albinet looked full in Maudra’s
face, and exclaimed, “ O, mother? what harm can
Iarine’s ringlets do to thee 1” The haughty woman
turned away from her child’s inquiring gaze, and
muttered in a low tone to the damsel, “ Have a care
that no one else plays with them, but thy doting
father, or this poor fool." Albinet began to gather up
the scattered tresses, while Iarine hastened to close the
door, having caught a glimpse of Phantasmion’s eager
face in the mirror. .
Afterwards the prince went forth, and saw Glandreth
at a little distance, hurrying to the lake, with pale dis-
ordered looks, and still the chart of the realm he meant
to conquer, was in his hand. “ Terriﬁed yet unsub-
dued!" exclaimed the youth; and when his enemy's
boat was midway between the island and the opposite
bank, he knelt upon the ground, and drew forth from
his body a hollow noise, which was conveyed over the
water with great force, to the chieftain’s ear; then he saw
Glandreth drop the oar, and let the vessel drift at random.

But Phantasmion arose. “ I will not break the calm
of this sunshiny hour,” he cried, “ with more loud peals.
O that these gentle-trilling birds, and that soft breeze,
could plead for me with my coy mistress!” Possessed
by such thoughts, he wandered about the ﬂower-beds,
and through many a pleasant copse, in hopes that he
might ﬁnd her, but still disappointed, he sadly cried,
“ O, harsh step-dame, to keep Iarine out of the sunshine
on such a day as this !” At length he approached that
ancient tower, detached from the main building, whither
he had seen the maiden ascend, the night she caught
the poisonous ﬁsh. Now it cast a black shadow in the
midst of the sunny garden: a thousand bees were busy
there, but not one murmured over the ﬂowers which lay
in that shade; no butterﬂy ﬂitted across to reach the
golden blossoms that basked in the warm rays beyond.
The entrance to the tower was open; he went in, and,
going up the dark winding stairs, he heard the voice of
Albinet: “I dare not play in the garden,” the boy
was saying, “for fear of the stranger youth.” A soft
reply which followed was not audible, and Phantasmion
mounted a little higher. “ Indeed now, sister, I did
see his wings,” rejoined Albinet ; “he hides them by
day under his cloak. O, sister, sister, perhaps it was
he that ﬂew away with our baby brother.” “Dear
child, I cannot let thee in,” replied the soft voice of
Iarine; “the door is locked, and thy mother has the
key.” “Alas! alas!” cried the child; “it is so dark
here !-—if I had wings I would ﬂy in at the window
which opens upon the lawn.” Phantasmion descended
the stairs, and soon discovered the window spoken of
by Albinet, then loosing his wings, he ﬂew up to it, _

and, looking into the apartment, beheld the maiden at
work on a superb vest, which lay ﬂoating in ample folds
over her lap, while Albinet was crying from without,
“ Sing, sing, Iarine; keep singing, that I may hear thy
voice.” As soon as the damsel espied Phantasmion
entering at the window, she turned her face to the door,
bent over her task with renewed assiduity, and began
singing aloud. The prince attempted to describe the
. ardour of his passion, to explain his conduct, and entreat
the beautiful princess to exchange that gloomy tower for
the throne of Palmland: but he wasted his eloquence
on deaf ears; Iarine kept singing, over and over again,
in concert with Albinet, a few verses which her mother
had taught her, and nothing would she reply but this :——-
Newts and blindworms do no wrong,
$potted snakes from guilt are clear ;
Smiles and sighs, a dang’rous throng,
Gentle spirit these I fear ;
Guard me from those looks of light,
Which only shine to blast the sight.
“ Do I blast thy sight, cruel Iarine 1” exclaimed the
youth ; and renewed his passionate prayers, which were
interrupted with words like these :
Serpents’ tongues have ne’er been known
Simple maid from peace to sever,
But the voice whose thrilling tone
Tells of love that lasts for ever,
Gentle spirit-
“O, gentle spirit, plead my cause !" exclaimed the
youth, “and dissipate this strange illusion. Look up,
fairest Iarine; I only borrowed wings that I might ﬂy

to thee, but take this sword, and cut them in pieces if
thou wilt.” The maid still kept her eyes on a wreath
of corn poppies which she was embroidering, nor stole
one look at the kingly brow with its black arches, that
inclined towards her in persuasive humility, nor at the
radiant eyes of the enamoured youth, cast down beseech-
ingly under their full lids and shadowy eye-lashes ; but
still she sang on, with Albinet :-—
Beetles black will never charm me,
Spiders weave no snares for me,
Thorny hedge-hogs cannot harm me,
But the brow where heaven I see,
Catching beams from sunny eyes,—-
Guard me from that bright disguise!
As the prince drew nearer to the damsel, ‘she pressed
closer to the door, trembling all over, and singing more
and more earnestly, and at last she knelt down,
wrapping the silken garment round her head and face
and her whole ﬁgure, till she was completely enveloped.
Thus baﬁled and utterly disappointed, Phantasmion
stood still, and clasping his hands, exclaimed, “ O fatal
disguise! O fatal magic arts that have undone me ! ”
Thrown off her guard by the earnest tone in which this
was uttered, Iarine let the robe fall from her head, and
looked up, somewhat fearfully, in the face of the youth
who stood at a little distance. His eyes met hers, he
uttered not a word, but again the maid felt irresistibly
persuaded that truth as well as beauty beamed from his
countenance. A spell seemed to hold them both silent
and motionless, but the spell is broken, for a feeble’
knocking is heard at the partition wall, and Iarine starts

up to obey that summons, letting Maudra’s unﬁnished
robe fall upon the ground. She opened a door, and
discovered Albinian with his head resting on a harp, of
which some strings were broken. Iarine braced them
up, and the greyhaired man began feebly to move the
chords, murmuring an old melody, the burden of which
was scarce intelligible to the prince; but when the
damsel joined in the strain, he distinguished words like
these :
The winds were whispering, the waters glistering,
A bay-tree shaded a sun-lit stream ;
Blasts came blighting, the bay-tree smiting,
When leaf and ﬂower, like a morning dream,
Vanished suddenly.
The winds yet whisper, the waters glister,
And softly below the bay-tree glide;
Vain is their cherishing, for, slowly perishing,
It doth but cumber the river side.
Leaﬂess in summer-time.

CHAPTER XXI.
PHANTASMION JOINS LARINE on THE LAKE.
PHANTASMION continued to gaze on Iarine, unper-
ceived by her father, whose face was turned in an
opposite direction, till he heard a key turn in the lock,
and the voice of Maudra speaking to Albinet. Then he
quitted the tower as he had entered it, and roamed
about the island, pondering how he might obtain an-
other interview with the princess. That day he poured
out wine for a noble company, but Glandreth was
absent, and Maudra’s glances fell upon his empty chair,
while Iarine seemed afraid to raise her downcast eyes,
lest they should meet those of a present lover. The
banquet being ended, Phantasmion repaired to the lake
side, and, looking out for Glandreth or Karadan, beheld
only the light skiffs of the castle guests lying at anchor
in the bay, their gay streamers rustling in a gentle
breeze. Albinet sate and looked at them with tearful
eyes; it seemed as if he loved to hear the varied in-
tonations of his childish grief, so long drawn out was
his sobbing and sighing. “I wish that breeze would
rise to a tempest ere to-morrow’s dawn,” he murmured;
“ my sister is to be upon the lake when the sun rises ;
and woe’s me ! I am not to be with her."-
Phantasmion's heart beat high with the thought of a
scheme which these words suggested ; he‘ dreamed of it,

sleeping and waking through the night, and by day-
break the next morning he was hovering over the lake.
There all was solitary and si!ent ; Iarine was not come ;
he ﬂew back again to listen at her chamber window,
and at last was so far carried away that he softly en-
tered, and hung over her, like a guardian spirit, while
she yet slept. Then he taxed himself to examine the
separate charms which made up that sum of beauty,
the graceful ﬂowing line in which the whole was con-
tained, the full eye, gently slanting at the outer side
like a dove’s, the soft gradation of colour, from locks of
golden brown to the dark thread-like eyebrow and still
blacker lashes, which, parting from fair white lids, ap-
peared like foliage of a yew-branch laden with a pile of
snow. It seemed as if the hand that streaks the tulip
and the iris, and traces jetty lines down many a milk-
white petal, had just ﬁnished painting that exquisite
picture, and left it with every tint bright and fresh as
new blown ﬂowers. But hush ! those eyes will quickly
open, and the prince dares not wait to see them unclosed !
He repassed the window, and, soaring upward, placed
himself beside the pinnacles of the castle.
From the top of the highest tower he watched Iarine
as she went leisurely across the lawn, till she disappeared
in a grove between the castle and the lake; and, full of
impatience he still waited, with outspread wings, till the
prow of her light shallop darted forth from the dark
green alders that clustered on the shore; then, plying
his ready sails, he launched into the air, swept over the
lawn and grove, and, wheeling round the boat, alighted
just in front of the beautiful damsel, who dropped the
oars and sate motionless when she saw him arriving.

“ Ah, leave me !" she cried, “ I must needs be alone ; the
queen bade me go unaccompanied to meet a messenger,
and receive some token or message for her.” “And
wilt thou be the blind servant of her wicked will, rather
than reign in my fair land '1" replied Phantasmion;
“nay, sweet princess, thou shalt go with me, and never
return to give an account of thy embassy.” Then he
seized the oars, and, turning the boat, made it ﬂy over
the waters like a swallow traversing the sky; Iarine
sought in vain to arrest his movements ; gaily the youth
smiled, when her hand was laid on his strong arm, as if
the snow would seek to impede the course of the torrent
on which it falls. “ My father!” she cried, “alas ! my
father! Thou hast taken his infant child, and wilt
thou rob him of me also ?” “ I took that child to place
him in safety,” answered the young monarch ;i and I will
place thee in more than safety: thou shalt be a queen,
and reign over all my subjects, as now thou dost over
' my heart.” “ Karadan hast promised to aid my father
against Glandreth,” said Iarine. “ What is his aid com-
pared to mine ?” exclaimed the youth; “ and what his ‘
love compared to that I bear thee '2" “ He is my
mother’s kinsman,” replied the maid ; “ my father loves
him as he never will love thee ; and for his sake I must
shun thee, and seek to love him.” “ Would it'be less
difﬁcult to love me than him ?” cried the prince, “ must
thou shun me ere thou canst love him l O, if this be
true, a thousand enemies and rivals shall never prevail '
against me!” Abandoning the oar he seized Iarine's
hand, but with the one still left at liberty she pointed to
the sky : “ See what clouds,” she said, “ have gathered
on the mountain—top ! how threatening they are! how

which tossed at a distance, its white Sails ﬂlltteflflg as
the wings of a tempest-beaten dove, was '
visible on the dusky horizon. Phantasmion surveyed
the sky, in the centre of which he seemed to discern One
cloud blacker than all the rest, and 1'011I1d it 3- felllt
edge of lighter hue; on that dark mass the youth could
not help gazing, it seemed so like the Shroud Of 6|

While his face was upturned, a sheet of lightning over-
spread the cope of heaven: dizzy and half-blinded he
cast down his eyes upon the lake, and there beheld the

the billow. It drives toward the foot of the lake, and
soon approaches the skiff which has been seen on the
horizon. Karadan is standing at the prow ! vainly does
he stretch out his arms and call upon Seshelma; she
cannot bring about that meeting which her arts con-
trived, for a mightier power than hers presides over the
storm. The dark youth beholds Iarine and Phantasmion
together; he may not look upon them long; the skiff
is going down; it sinks! “ O save him!” exclaims
the maid; and Phantasmion leaps into the tumbling
element. It is a desperate enterprise ; those wings, not
made for the water, now only encumber him, and
Karadan clings round his body with the clasp of a
drowning man. Long did he struggle, but in vain: he
and his rival were nigh sinking together, when a vessel,
conducted by the old ﬁsherman from the lower end of
the lake, arrived in time to save them from death.
In a little while they were rescued from the waves, and
laid at the bottom of the wide bark, where the crew
surrounded them, intent on their restoration, and none
save the aged husband of Telza, bestowed a thought on
the damsel in the narrow boat.
But the storm now abated, and Iarine, waving her
hand to the ﬁsherman, in token that she needed no
help, slowly pursued her way homewards. On the
horizon of the plain, beyond the foot of the lake, a
border of pale brightness was visible; it seemed to
show that there was a silver ﬁrmament behind those
tumultuous volumes of cloud which had remained un-
moved throughout the chaos of the storm. The maid
was alone, but for herself she felt no fear; she thought
not of Karadan or of Glandreth, of the water witch or

of an angry step-dame; she was thinking only of
Phantasmion. Her love had hitherto been as a distant
strain of music, scarce noted by one that is busily occu-
pied; but now the harmony sounds fuller and more
distinct; it will be heard, and the hum of many voices
falls into an undersong. With reluctance she recedes
from the vessel where she lately saw him taken in,
dripping and senseless. That bark was ﬁlled with
servants of Magnart, who had been despatched from
Polyanthida in search of their master’s son. Learning
from the old ﬁsherman that he had gone upon the lake,
they ventured through the storm, guided by the old
man, in the direction of the island, whither they sup-
posed he might have taken his course. Phantasmion
recovered wholly while Karadan was but just beginning
to revive, and, while the men in the boat were still
bending around the dark youth, he took ﬂight from the
stern, and hastened to rejoin Iarine.
Black clouds were yet rolled around the body of the
hills, while the head of the lake and one side of the
island were still thickly veiled with mist ; but the sun
began to gild the peaks of the mountains, and a vivid
rainbow spanned the waters, which now lay motionless
and inky black, as if a trance had succeeded to violent
agitation. Again Phantasmion stood by the side of
Iarine: with moist wings he hovered over the boat,
when the maid looked up and continued to ply the oars
without speaking: but there was a smile on her face,
and the youth entered the narrow vessel.' Ere that
splendid phantom which bent around them had faded
away, Iarine and Phantasmion were bound to each other
by the strongest ties that words can form; clouds or

sunshine might reign without, but their faith was to
remain like the dial, which stands ﬁxed and changeless,
while day and night roll on, and can but brighten or
darken its face as they are passing over it. Now the
youth feels that perfect satisfaction in the present hour
which lulls in its tranquil ecstacy, all hope, all eﬁort, all
reﬂection, all forecast ; even the certain knowledge that
the dream must dissolve, cannot lessen its charm, that
joyfulness of feeling which thought has no power to
shake. He took from beneath his girdle the chaplet
which had been worn by Zalia, and on which was
inscribed, “ The Queen of Palmland.” He showed her
the ruby ﬂowers with their leaves of emerald, and the
lady smiled, but turned away, and again pointed to the
heavens. “ How strange it is,” she said, “ that those
wreaths of vapour are yet lying on the lake, when every
cloud has left the mountain, and almost all have melted
from the sky! ” Phantasmion cast his eyes around
and saw that the welkin was clear, except above the
vapoury mass to which Iarine pointed ; there he descried
the same noticeable cloud which he had gazed upon in
the beginning of the tempest; it was in the form of a
cross, and the shape was more conspicuous now that it
was alone in the sky. “ Let us fear nothing,” cried the
youth; “these clouds too will disperse like the rest,
and we shall have perfect sunshine.” Scarce had he
spoken thus, and placed the chaplet on Iarine’s brow,
when a boat shot forth from the dark mist. Glandreth
was standing at the prow, and that vessel was followed
by a train of others, which, at his command, surrounded
Phantasmion and Iarine.
In a few moments the youth was bound with cords

which fastened his arms and delicate pinions to his
body, and, while Glandreth’s armed men were dragging
him away to the Castle, he beheld the chieftain con-
ducting Iarine to the shore, then Maudra hidden among
the trees, jealously watching his actions, then the droop-
ing Albinian with his lame child on their way to the
lake side. Albinet pulled his father’s arm as Phantas-
mion passed him. “ Look at his shoulders,” he said;
“now see his wings by daylight!” The cross—formed
cloud had disappeared, and the sky seemed an endless
depth of sunny blue when Phantasmion was hidden from
daylight in a subterranean vault of the castle.

CHAPTER XXII.
PHANTASMION ESCAPES FROM PRISON AND PRESENTS
HIMSELF TO IARINE IN DISGUISE.
DARK and cold was the place in which Phantasmion
was conﬁned, and such as might have chilled a less
ardent temper than his, but he paced the stone ﬂoor,
like a leopard in a cage, devising plans of escape, and
nursing hopes of vengeance. He had now leisure to
review the events of the morning, and now he surmised
that Maudra had sent Iarine to meet Karadan at the
suggestion of her wily counsellor, because she desired, at
any cost, to remove her from the eyes of Glandreth;
that the dark youth had planned to carry her away, and
that their schemes and his own had been frustrated by
the intervention of Oloola. “The spirit‘ of the storm
cannot conquer the heart of Iarine ! ” cried he; “other
things may change for the better, and that will never
change for the worse."
Thus he hoped and triumphed, but no food was given
him, and his limbs were painfully pinioned, so that
after a certain length of time he sank on the ﬂoor,
exhausted and spiritless. His eyes were ﬁxed in anguish
on the massy door, at the top of the stone steps, by
which he had descended into the dungeon, when he
heard the bolts withdrawn and, in a few moments,
Glandreth stood before him, sumptuously attired, and

with a ﬂaming lamp in his hand. “ King of Palmland,”
said he, with a smile, “why hast thou chosen to conceal
from a brother chief thy rank and dignity?" “A
brother chief ! ” ejaculated the captive, in .high disdain.
“I know thee now,” pursued Glandreth, “ and can offer
terms suitable to thy rank. Deign to read that scroll:
I may not tarry to hear thy reply, for I must visit my
fair mistress Iarine, who will brook delay on my part
worse than thou wilt. Early to-morrow thou shalt see
me again, and the light of the sun also, if thou approvest
the conditions.” So saying, he placed the lamp and
the scroll on the ground beside the prisoner, and without
loosing his bands, or giving him a morsel of food,
quitted the dungeon. Phantasmion began to peruse
the writing laid before him by his adversary, and found
only such proposals as roused his indignation. “ No ! "
he exclaimed aloud, “ rather than yield half my kingdom,
and what I value more than the whole of it, my claim
on the hand of Iarine, let the ﬂoor of this dungeon be
my death—bed ! here let me perish since Potentilla does
not come to my aid.” Just as he had spoken thus,
Phantasmion beheld a multitude of saw-ﬂies with yellow
bodies and black heads, ﬂitting toward the light of the
lamp; along with them came numbers of wasps, and
the youth shrank as he beheld the mingled swarm
approaching himself. He had little cause for fear; they
alighted on the cords that bound his arms and wings,
and setting resolutely to work, the wasps with their
jaws, the ﬂies with their rasping instruments, they
severed the tough threads, till the prisoner, by a single
effort, snapped the weakened bands; at that moment
his arms were stretched at full length, and his wings

broke forth like the tender leaves of a tree. when released
from their gummy sheath. Away ﬂew the whole
company of wasps and ﬂies, and while they were
disappearing by the narrow space between the bottom of
the door and the top of the stairs, Phantasmion perceived
a host of bees entering on the opposite side. They ﬂew
to a corner of the roof, and holding up the lamp, he
saw that waxen combs were suspended above his head,
and that the bees were there depositing the honey
which they had just collected in the gardens of the
island. Phantasmion now acknowledged that he had
not been neglected by Potentilla, who had been employed
in his service ever since he entered the dungeon. He
soon gained possession of the luscious store, which the
bees abandoned at his approach; and having feasted on
the honey, found his strength and his hopes return
together, nay, felt as jocund as one that has drunk new
wine. In this mood he passed the remainder of the night,
and when a few faint rays of the dawn found their way
beneath the door into his gloomy abode, he ascended the
steps to examine a painted roll which Glandreth had let
fall as he left the dungeon; it was all emblazoned with
gay devices, in the midst of which Phantasmion read
these lines :—
False Love, too long thou hast delay’d,
Too late I make my choice; '
Yet win for me that precious maid,
And bid my heart rejoice:
Then shall mine eyes shoot youthful ﬁre,
My cheek with triumph glow,
And other maids that glance desire,
Which I on one bestow.


## p. 172 (#198) ############################################

Make her with smile divinely bland
Beam sunshine o'er my face,
And Time shall touch with gentlest hand
What she hath deigned to grace;
O’er scanty locks full wreaths I’ll wear;
No wrinkled brow to shade,
For joy will smooth the furrows there,
Which earlier griefs have made.
Though sports of youth be tedious toil.
When youth has pass’d away,
I’ll cast aside the martial spoil
With her light locks to play;
Yea, turn, sweet maid, from tented ﬁeld
To rove where dew-drops shine,
Nor care what hand the sceptre wield,
So thou wilt grant me thine.
Before the lamp expired, Phantasmion fed its ﬂame
with this testimony of his rival's passion, then re-ascended
the steps, and stationed himself beside the door. Hearing
a key thrust into the rock he hovered about it, on
balanced wings, face downward, and while Glandreth
was beginning to descend, rushed past him out of the
dungeon. The fugitive played his vans faster and faster,
till he had cleared the island, then away over the lake
he ﬂoated through clear ﬁelds of air, as if borne along
by the breeze, without a movement of his outspread
pinions.
He alighted in the midst of that thicket where he had
formerly spent the night, and looked about with momenwl
tary dread to see that no snake yet lurked there. Scarcely
had he ﬁnished hiding his wings, when the ﬁshermarfﬂ
ancient dame come in sight, and, being startled at This
unexpected appearance, let her bundle of sticks fall ‘£0

the ground. The youth accosted her kindly, and began
to collect her scattered burden, while she seized the
opportunity of chatting and asking questions. “Thou
hast travelled far since we saw thee last,” she cried;
" but there is no city in Almaterra so well worth going
to see as the capital of this country, Diamantha.” “ How
knowest thou that I have not been to see it ? ” said the
prince, with a smile. “ I think thou wouldst hardly
come away,” said Telza, “just as the court are going
thither." “ Are they going thither?” inquired the
prince; “ah! methinks, I heard tell of this; and when
will they set out ?” “ This very day,” replied the dame ;
“ come to my cottage and thou wilt see them pass." By
the time that Phantasmion reached a rising ground, just
beyond that lowly cot, the royal train might be seen
winding along the vale; and, long after they were out
of sight, he stood looking after them wrapped in thought.
Telza marked his countenance. “The last time thou
wert here," said she, “our lovely princess passed by:
truly till thou hast seen her thou hast not set eyes on
the fairest thing in Rockland.”
Phantasmion partook once more of Telza’s hospitality,
and learned from the ﬁsherman, her husband, that Glan-
dreth was not travelling with the King and Queen, but
was still at the Island. Forthwith he resolved to follow
Iarine, and, taking ‘leave of the aged pair, pursued his
journey alone ; but presently, fearing that he might stray
out of the right course, he looked about for some one to
guide or direct him. So doing he espied a number of
tall peasant girls with baskets on their heads, and saw
them sit down by the way-side to eat their provisions.
“Who are these lofty maidens?” inquired the youth.


## p. 174 (#200) ############################################

I 74 P/umtasmion

A passing countryman, to whom he had spoken, made
answer, “They come from a certain glen, and are bound
for a neighbouring town, where they expect to sell the
fruit in their baskets: some of them will not need to go
so far, for this evening they will overtake the royal house-
hold who are already encamped at no great distance."
Phantasmion approached one of the damsels: “Are all
the women of your valley as tall as thou and thy com-
rades, fair maiden ?” he said. “No women are so tall
as those of our glen,” she replied; “and no fruit is so
ﬁne as that which we gather on the tops of our hills.
Prithee taste and buy.” “ I will buy thy whole basket,”
answered he, “if I may purchase thy cloak and head-
gear too :—and how might I procure the secresy of thy
comrades, were I to go along with them thus disguised?"
That affair was quickly despatched by ‘the mountain
maiden, who dighted the prince in her upper vest and
mufﬂing head dress, placed her basket on his head, and
departed to a cottage hard by with more gold in her
hand than the baskets of all the company were like to
gain. The prince went on with the rest of the band,
and, about evening, espied a number of tents erected at
the entrance of a wood. The women were soon dis-
persed among them, eager to gain purchasers for their
fruit, and Phantasmion, having learnt that the princess
was wandering in the forest, hastily went in search of
her, followed by some of his new associates. Soon he
hears a rustling amid the leaves, a bird falls from its
lofty perch, and young Albinet shouts for joy. “ Sister !”
he cried, “my little bow and arrows will shoot as well
as the longest and strongest in the land." “ I prithee
aim not at me, young archer!” cried a voice from amid

the trees; “ nor take me for a white heron or long-necked
crane!" Phantasmion hastened on. The voice was at
some distance, but believing it to be that of Iarine he
wondered at such lively tones. Soon he entered a glade,
where three white-robed damsels were standing beside a
rivulet; the ﬁrst who was looking toward the wood was
Zelneth; Iarine and Leucoia were talking together at a
little distance. The youth drew his head-dress, which
he had begun to push aside, close over his face, while
his comrades offered their fruit to the lady. “ Here are
the tall mountaineers,” cried she, “ with their pleasant
cloud-berries; let us sit beside that elder tree and eat
the dainty fruit.” Phantasmion was by this time kneel-
ing before Iarine and vainly endeavouring to catch her
eye, unperceived by Leucoia; but Zelneth called him
away to place the fruit in his basket on broad leaves
which grew near the brook, and, while this repast was
eaten, the maidens’’ talk went on. “ I have little doubt,”
said Iarine, “that we shall ﬁnd Karadan at Diamantha,
near the northern palace. Arzene’s heart may soon be
set at ease." “ Nay,” cried Zelneth, “it is more likely
that we shall ﬁnd him about the Black Lake, for it was
there that he escaped again from those who were sent to
bring him home.” “Was he imprisoned in the dark
vault of the tower, or in the castle?" “ Karadan im-
prisoned !” said Iarine. “ I meant that other youth, of
whom thou and Zelneth were speaking,” replied her
cousin. “ He was conﬁned in the tower,” answered
Iarine with tears, “and perhaps he is a prisoner still.”
“And thou didst nothing to set him free !” exclaimed
Zelneth : “ I would have died ”—here the damsel checked
her hasty speech, struck by an eager countenance which

reminded her of Semiro. But Phantasmion turned away,
and the startling likeness was forgotten when Iarine
offered her a key, and in an earnest tone rejoined,
“ Then go thou to the Island, and open his prison door."
“I am ready to attend thee, Zelneth,” cried Leucoia,
quickly rising from her seat. “Why didst thou not
release the captive thyself?” said Zelneth, as she took
the key. “I was prevented by the queen,” Iarine re-
plied; “'she met me as I descended the steps of the
tower, where I had discovered it beneath the tapestry,
and, full of misplaced suspicion, angrily sent me to my
chamber.” “And thou wilt seek for Karadan,” said
Zelneth, “ while we perform this charitable errand?”
“ O hasten to perform it this very hour," exclaimed the
lovely princess, “ Yon cloud above the wood is yet full
of radiance, and even when the sun declines, it is plea-
sant travelling by the softer beams of the moon.” “ Which
will not rise this night, sweet cousin,” Zelneth made
reply. “ For that favouring countenance we may vainly
pray, as luckless Karadan does for thine." '
Then the three slender damsels and the manlike
mountaineers with their princely companion quitted the
lawn and pursued their way through the wood. . “ Come,
Albinet! we are returning!” cried Iarine, but the boy,
with a laugh, went and hid himself among the under- *
wood. Phantasmion kept by the side of Iarine, and,
when Zelneth and Leucoia stepped forward, he pulled
her robe. The princess looked up in surprise, but at
that moment the dark-eyed maiden turned back to address
her cousin ;-—“ What will our mother think of this
journey?” she cried, “ and, after all, what thanks shall
I earn ? ” “ A thousand thanks ! ” said Iarine, blushing

deeply, “ From thee, but not from him!” murmured
Zelneth. “ I will never repine,” Iarine answered,
“ whatever guerdon he offers thee." Zelneth smiled and
again stepped forward with Leucoia ; Phantasmion once
more touched Iarine’s robe and Whispered, “ I am here;
and subject to no will but thine.” Joy now animated
her trembling frame, and when Zelneth addressed her
once more she wondered at the glow of happiness that
mantled on her cheek. “ Unhappy Karadan !” sighed
the maiden. “Hush!” cried Iarine; “my father is
approaching.” Then Leucoia impatiently beckoned to
Zelneth : “ Come, sister,” she cried, “ if thou art resolved
on this journey we must mount our steeds without delay."
The daughters of Magnart now departed, after taking
leave of their kinswoman, who remained within the
wood, and beheld the crimson sun half sunk below the
distant plain, betwixt bare shafts of trees, which looked
like pillars of ebony. Over their rugged roots Albinian
was slowly advancing, his thin white locks just tinged
with red by the sunbeams. Glandreth and his armed
band were close behind, their casques glittering brightly,
while their shadows blackened the ground. The chief
strode on before them, passing Zelneth and Leucoia with-
out a glance, for he had discerned Iarine in the wood.
With ﬁrm step and lofty port he came, while the totter-
ing Albinian hurried on when he perceived his approach,
and went to lean upon the lady’s arm. “Give me the
hand of the fair princess, thy daughter,” said Glandreth,
“ and thou shalt have a ﬁrmer support than she alone can
give." The old man's face appeared convulsed with
inward passion; he strove to speak, but words failing
him, shook his head and waved the chief away.

Glandreth, incensed by the refusal of Albinian, impetu-'
ously took the lady’s hand from his, and the feeble man,
overthrown by that sudden movement, fell to the earth.
Iarine turned her indignant eye upon the proud usurper,
and would have knelt by the side of Albinian, but the
chief detained her hand, till Phantasmion leaning for-‘
ward from the group of damsels, forced him to release it,
seizing his arm with no friendly grasp. Astonished that
a woman could assault him thus, he turned about and
was wounded at that moment in the cheek by a small
arrow which ﬂew from the underwood. Then believing
himself surrounded by concealed enemies, he shouted to
his armed men, who were still in the back ground. ' They
hastened into the wood, but scarcely had they entered it,
when a cloud descended from on high and hung, like~a
canopy, over the tops of the tall trees.
composed of innumerable winged insects : every moment
it grew thicker and thicker, and the soldiers groped
about in total darkness, unable to ﬁnd their chief. He,
meantime, was battling with armies of moths, which, as
fast as he cut them away with his sword, continued to
swarm around him undiminished, and soon his _men at
arms were engaged in like manner : they ran against the
trees, and straggled in all directions into the wood, trying
to escape from their countlessantagonists. Phantasmion
seized by mistake, the robe of Albinian, who was clinging
to Iarine, and whispered in his ear. “My fairest, dost
thou still love the stranger from Palmland ?” a low groan _
was the only answer to this fond inquiry. The youth
let go his hold and rushed away to a little distance;
there the cloud of insects dispersed right above his head,
and, looking up into the clear space, he beheld Potentilla,

cloaked in wide moth wings, hovering aloft. She
beckoned to Phantasmion ; he dropped his feminine garb,
and soaring upwards, ﬂoated by the side of his guardian
Fairy through the dim grey sky. By the time that both
were out of sight, the wood was free from insects : the
sun’s ﬂaming ball had sunk, and no moon had arisen;
but one large star was shooting its diamond rays just
over the top of a sable ﬁr tree.

CHAPTER XXIII.
POTENTILLA WEAVES A WONDROUS WEB FOR
PHANTASMION.
POTENTILLA guided Phantasmion to the chief palace of
Rockland, situate between the sea and Diamantha, after
he had procured the dress of a peasant by the way.
The travellers rested in an orange grove, and, when the
prince besought Potentilla to deliver Iarine from the
power of Glandreth and Maudra, she made answer,
“To-morrow, the courtly company will arrive at this
place. I cannot give thee troops of horse and men in
armour to meet them; but I will exhibit a strange
spectacle, and while the crowd are gazing at it thou
mayest carry oﬁ" the princess to the sea shore. There
‘the son of Magnart hath a skiff in readiness; for he
still hopes to win Iarine, and carry her to a‘ secret
bower in Nemorosa. This vessel, if thou art before-
hand with him, may transport thy fair one and thee to
Palmland."
The heart of Phantasmion bounded with joyful expec-
tation when he heard the fairy speak thus. He donned
his rustic disguise, took a pruning hook in his hand,
and, when he saw any one approach, seemed to be busy
among the shrubs. He fed on the fruits of the garden,
and at night lay down to sleep in a clump of trees, close
by the principal entrance to the royal domain. Right

in front of that gate, at the top of a gentle ascent, over
which the road led to the Diamanthine palace, was a
triurnphal arch of light architecture, erected to com-
memorate the conquest of Tigridia, but now overgrown
with climbing plants and decked with their gay blossoms.
Phantasmion had not reposed long when he was awakened
by an eager dream: he thought he saw the royal proces-
sion enter the great gate and advance toward the archway.
One by one the company seemed to be pacing along;
Iarine passes, but still he is chained to the turf where
he lies ; the damsel ﬂoats on,——she gains the arch, but
just as she is about to disappear Phantasmion starts up.
The dream has vanished, but the scene remains, and, by
the pale light of the midnight sky, he discerns a strange
object under the festive fabric: a spider, as big as a
wolf, is wheeling round and round within the circuit of
the lofty arch, spinning and weaving as she goes. The
frame-work of her giant web is formed, the warp is laid
out, and now she is travelling round and round to ﬁll in
the gummy woof. Not long afterwards Phantasmion
beheld the fairy artisan depart, in the manner of spiders,
shooting long lines into the air, and seeming to ﬂy with-
out wings. Upwards she travels, and now she darts
across the moon’s bow, and now she is a black spot in
the midst of a twinkling constellation. Phantasmion
slept again, and the ﬁrst object that struck his newly
opened eyes was the magic web, looking like a wheel of
ﬁre in the rosy light of morning. Anon those ﬂames
expired : every spoke and cross-thread appeared to be a
shining icicle, and the whole might have been taken for
a crystal net; but soon the elastic substance began to
undulate beneath a gentle breeze, and all the scarlet

I 8 2 P/zantasmzbn
blossoms which ﬂaunted over it were softly heaved up
and down. Phantasmion feared that the delicate
apparition would melt away before the travellers arrived,
but the sun, as it grew stronger and stronger, had no
power to dissolve that fabric, and, while a crowd was
advancing from the palace to view it close at hand, the
courtly train, being suddenly arrested on entering the
great gate by this unexpected sight, and utterly forget-
ful of every other object, stood gazing in wonder at the
magic web. Phantasmion easily recognized Iarine amid
a bevy of damsels, though she and all of them were
veiled from head to foot. He shaded his brow with his
peasant’s cap, and, approaching the princess, eagerly
whispered, “Come with me and I will explain this
wonder.” The lady started, threw down her veil, which
she had partly drawn aside to survey the spectacle, and,
after a few moments’ hesitation, stole away into the wide
plain beyond the precincts of the palace. Phantasmion
followed, full of hope and joy,'and beheld Iarine, ﬂeet
as an antelope, speeding across the moor. She had
gained some ground at ﬁrst, and, so swiftly did she
bound along, that the youth came not up with her till
she had sunk down among the trees of a shady copse.
Great was his surprise when he arrived here to ﬁnd the
princess, her veil thrown off, clad in the habit of a
shepherdess, with a crook in her hand. “ Wherefore is
this disguise?” he cried, “and why hast thou ﬂed hither?
on the sea coast we shall ﬁnd a vessel wherein we may
sail to Palmland, and thence up the great river to my
very palace gates.” Iarine replied, “ My heart is thine, _
and yet I may not go with thee ; I am bound by a vow
to make a pilgrimage elsewhere; the strongest proof of

love which thou canst give will be to let me instantly
depart and ask not whither I am going.” Phantasmion
felt like one who has dreamt of golden fruit, and,
waking, sees what he had dreamt of glowing nigh, but
ﬁnds his arms fettered, his feet fastened to the ground.
“This device of thine," she said, “has enabled me to
escape, just as I had begun to despair of what I so
anxiously, desired. If my enterprise succeeds, I shall
owe that happiness to thee.“ Cheerily the maiden
spoke, yet could not choose but weep, while Phantasmion
remained speechless and tearful, looking in her face with
imploring eyes, as if he hoped by the mute eloquence of ’
his grief to melt away her resolution. Iarine cut off
one of her long ringlets, tied it round the arm of the
sorrowful youth, and smiling playfully yet tenderly,
bound him with that silken fetter to the branch of a
shrub. “Farewell!” she said, “ when next'we meet
thou mayest fasten the chain on me, and, if it binds me
to thyself, believe that I will gladly wear it even to my
life's end.” Then she took up her shepherd’s crook,
and hastened away, nor turned her head till her motions
were scarce to be discerned by him she left behind
through the dimness of distance. Phantasmion sought
not to follow her, but, long after she was out of sight,
he stood in the same attitude as when she disappeared,
clasping the glossy ringlet in unconscious hands.
At length he moved away, and wandering along with
uncertain steps, found himself once more beside the
archway. ‘It was now past noon-day, and all the gazers
had dispersed ; but still the mystic web remained, and,
while he was looking at it with sorrowful eyes, he saw
a beautiful bird called a chinquis ﬂy into it, and become

entangled in its meshes. While it ﬂuttered there he
recognized it as one which he had been wont to caress
and feed in Palmland, and which had gained the name
of the moon-bird, from the sky—blue moons or mirrors
which adorned its wings and train. “ Poor bird,” said
the prince, “ thou hast followed me hither out of love !
thou shalt not perish in these toils, if I can set thee at,
liberty.” He threw oﬂ' his upper vest, fanned the air
lightly with his pinions, and, forgetting the supernatural
strength and tenacity of Potentilla’s work, laboured to
free the bird till he himself became entangled, and
struggling to disengage his wings was only the more
ﬁrmly glued to the web. Thus he hung, suspended in
the centre of the arch, with the moon-bird by his side,
while a set of rustics who beheld him from the open
gate, believed him to be some deity that presided over
the feathered tribes, and gazed at his wings in silent
wonder. All his struggles to escape were vain, till a,
large eagle, rushing upon the moon-bird, became like-
wise entangled in the toils. He with his strong pinions
shook the net so violently, that at last it was rent
asunder: aloft he ﬂew with great part of the web
clinging to his back, and Phantasmion was dashed upon
the ground. For some moments he lay under the
triumphal arch with his eyes closed and his senses
gone; but, coming to himself, he beheld the pretty
moon-bird hovering affectionately over him. Then he
arose, drew on his cloak, and hastened out of the royal
precincts; having gained a lonely place, he tried his
wings, but, ﬁnding they were too much injured to
sustain him aloft, except during very short ﬂights, full
of sorrow and perplexity, he took his way to the sea-
shore.

Karadan had gone thither before him; Karadan
stood on the rocky beach, and raising to his lips a
trumpet-formed shell, produced a sound in which the '
tones of the wind, as it whistles through a crevice, were
combined with the deep, full, swelling voice of many
waters. The blast was borne over the liquid plain,
and soon a woman’s form arose from the ocean; the
setting sun threw its orange glow on the bloodless
visage of Seshelma, as onward she came, cleaving, the
amber ﬂood; a smile widened her ﬂat face and
glittered in her yellow eyes, unshaded by lashes, and,
thus illumined, her countenance looked like that of a
demon brightened by surrounding ﬂames. “ Where is
Iarine 1" exclaimed Karadan; “hath my rival carried
her away, and have thy promises come to this?”
“ Iarine is gone to Nemorosa,” replied the sorceress,
“ and he to whom she has given her heart is not far
off.” At these words Seshelma smiled maliciously
upon Karadan, and the youth uttered a deep groan.
“ Accursed be the day,” he cried, “ when I entered into
a league with thee! Iarine loves my rival and what
fruit have I of this wicked bond ?” “ Do my bidding
as heretofore," said the woman-ﬁsh, “ and thou shalt
banish thy rival from the maiden’s heart.” “ Away!”
cried Karadan impatiently; “ thy promises are but vain
lures.” “What!” was the reply; “have I not put
into thy hands the silver pitcher?” “ That is true,”
cried the youth ; “ what hast thou to propose?” “ The
king of Palmland,” she answered, “ hath Iarine’s infant
brother secreted in his palace: place that child in my
power, and I will cause the maiden to believe that
Phantasmion has delivered him to me. Agree to this,

and I will transport thee to his royal domain long before
he can return to it: thou shalt travel swiftly by the
sea and up the large'river which ﬂows past the palace
of Palmland to enter the ocean.” Cold drops stood on
Karadan’s brow while he debated within himself on this
proposal ; at last he exclaimed, “ O never will I betray
the child that Iarine loves to this monster! One sacri-
ﬁce I have promised ; to gain that heavenly maid, I
have made a vow which renders me unworthy to possess
her. Surely I have never loved aright.” Seshelma
‘laughed, and that long drawn jeering laugh blended
with the bubble and hiss of the waters and died into
the piping of the wind : but no angry emotion ruﬂied
the glazed surface of her face, as she fronted the youth's
agitated countenance. “ Do as thou wilt,” she replied ;
“ perchance thou art wise to cease contending in this
cause, for who can alter the ﬁxed purposes of fate?
There are spirits of the ﬂood that can see into futurity.”
—“ Did they tell thee of her I love ?” interrupted
Karadan with vehemence ; “ shall the maid be mine '2 ”
“ Never!” answered Seshelma, and again she laughed,
while it seemed as if her laugh was re—ech0ed by a
lurking train under the waters, till it passed off into
the noises of the ocean. “ Treacherous ﬁend l "
Karadan shrieked aloud, “ shall Phantasmion possess
Iarine? Dost thou answer, yes? unsay that word
and I will come and dwell with thee, all hideous as thou
art, in dark and breathless caves for ever!” Furiously
he rushed forward and seized her extended arm, whereat
a lightning ﬂash of electricity shot through his frame ;
his impotent grasp relaxed; he stood motionless, cramped
in every muscle, and with anguish-stricken eyes, bent in

ﬁxed stare_ upon the deep, beheld the enchantress hold-
ing up her hands in mockery, while she retreated back-
wards through the ocean, leisurely rocking up and down
with the waves, as if she resigned herself, like a drifting
vessel, to their guidance.

CHAPTER XXIV.
PHANTASMION RETURNS TO PALMLAND BY SEA.
MEANTIME Phantasmion approached the sea shore by a
thickly wooded gorge, the lovely Chinquis ﬂying by his
side or before him, then rushing up among the trees to
play hide and seek with her master, as she had been
wont to do in the groves of Palmland. From between
the last rocks of the valley appeared a small portion of
the sea, in the midst of which, a little skiff moved on
the dark waves with white sails gleaming in the twilight.
The moon-bird paused not with Phantasmion to note
that object, but skimming on, now hither now thither,
with careless waste of motion, ﬂew unawares against the
face of Karadan, as he turned an angle of the winding
road. The youth, being suddenly startled in his miser-
able mood, lifted an angry hand and smote the bird with
such force that it fell to the ground ; whereupon Phan-
tasmion sprang forward, and the two princely rivals
stood face to face. “ Well met!” cried the young king
of Palmland ; “ I have not come hither in vain, since I
have encountered thee. Let us ﬁght now for that
pitcher which hangs to thy girdle.” “ So be it !” cried
Karadan, hastily unfastening the vessel; “I will show
thee a good place, smooth and light.” He hurried on,
till, coming within a stone’s throw of a chasm amid the
rocks, he raised his hand to ﬂing the pitcher down that

P/zantasmion returns to Palmland. I89
dark abyss, hoping thus to prevent its falling to the lot
of his rival, let the event of the conﬂict be what it
might. But Phantasmion, springing forward, stayed
his arm; the pitcher fell at his feet; Karadan in des-
peration drew his dagger, and was rushing on his
unguarded adversary, when the moon-bird, which had
risen from the ground unobserved, ﬂew upon him and
darted her beak into his eye. A stream of blood gushed
down his cheek; he was still feeble from the effects of
Seshelma’s touch, and, overpowered by this second blow,
he fell fainting on the ground. Phantasmion resolved
to secure the pitcher, and ﬁght with Karadan on some
future opportunity; he began to draw it from under
the body of the youth, who opened his eyes and groaned
deeply, but had not strength to stir. The prince saw
that his lips moved, but no articulate sounds reached
the listener’s ear. He desisted for a moment, then
renewed his attempt, and, pulling out the pitcher, sought
to place it under his cloak, but the handle slipped out
of his ﬁngers; he took it up again, but the same thing
happened ; then he would have seized the vessel by the
lip, but, like those insects which elude the grasp with
their ﬁnely polished cases or pliant hair, it still glided
away ; he might as well have tried to hold quicksilver,
and, after many vain attempts, he began to suspect that
he was foiled by some invisible being. “ Can Seshelma
prevail here," he cried, “ among rocks and trees and
ﬂowery banks?” Phantasmion cast his eyes around
him on all sides; at a little distance from the place
where he stood grew a tall branching plant, sheeted with
blossoms, which at this evening hour were newly opened,
when other plants had closed their dewy cups and bells.


## p. 190 (#216) ############################################

' I 90 P/zantasmzbn
At mid-day the hue of those ﬂowers would have looked
wan and spiritless ; but now that the sky was sobered,
now that scarlet and crimson began to blacken, while
blue, lilac, and green were growing all alike, the ‘silver
yellow gleam of the broad disk, which gathered in the
light, like eyes of night birds, had a noticeable lustre,
and they seemed to be the beautiful spectres of blossoms
that had perished in the day. Just above that luminous
plant appeared another spectre, yet more softly resplen-
dent. It was the Fairy Feydeleen, with warning hand
outstretched toward the youth of Palmland. “Phan-
tasmion !” she whispered, “the tears of Arzene have
prevailed, and, even against thee, I must guard her
truant son. Go hence, I beseech thee, and trouble him
no more.” The young monarch obeyed; he proceeded
down the glen, and, looking back, ere the path turned
away, beheld the delicate fairy pouring balm from a
chalice on the eyes of Karadan.
And now Phantasmion has entered the little skiff,
and is about to leave those hostile shores, when on the
summit of the cliff, high over-head, he beholds two
ﬁgures, the indistinct lineaments of which, seen through
the dusk, ﬁll his soul with apprehension. That stony
outline of an armed form, sharp as the rugged rock, and
that soft quivering plume belong to none but Glandreth,
while, on the other side, vast wings upraised, and move-
less, bespeak the presence of Oloola. She points to an
eagle that ﬂies overhead with threads of network hang-
ing from its feathers. It is the one that rent Potentillafs
web; Glandreth looks after the bird, then eagerly
renews his discourse; what words he uttered were in-
audible to Phantasmion, but the gale brought to his ear

Oloola’s resonant reply. “ Phantasmion has not carried
her away; she is gone to seek a spring of healing
waters; for the sake of Albinian and of Albinet,
she roams afar.” The youth listened eagerly: Glan—
dreth’s discourse was a dull murmur, but Oloola spake
again, and her words appeared to have been blown
through a trumpet. “ While Phantasmion goes in search
of Iarine, Glandreth shall conquer the Land of Palms.”
Then Glandreth ‘shouted for joy till all the rocks re-
echoed, and Phantasmion saw that Oloola had disappeared
from the cliff. He was still watching Glandreth and
listening to the uproar which his voice raised along the
shore, when the little vessel in which he stood was
suddenly lifted up and whirled about in the air, while
the sea dashed and roared and eddied underneath, as if
a waterspout had fallen on the spot. The moon-bird,
having no power to resist that blast, eddied round and
round without the vessel; but gradually the wind fell,
the sea grew smooth, and the fragile bark settled on the
water, as a falcon sinks to her nest after wheeling about
restlessly in the air. Meantime Phantasmion heard a
voice on high, and it sent these words to his ear, “I
swore to serve him till Anthemmina’s dying day.”
The moon is up, and two large stars, bright spots of
light, appear as if they had dropped out of her beaming
crescent ; Phantasmion admires not the moon, nor fancies
an invisible chain by which those pendant gems may be
linked to her golden bow. The chinquis rests upon the
mast and sleeps in the moonlight, her splendid train,
with all its mirrors, reﬂecting the mild rays of night:
but the Prince of Palmland gazes not on her: in thought
he is following the lovely pilgrim through dangerous

woods and wilds. Thus he coasted along, coming to land
now and then for provisions, till he reached Palmland,
and sailed up the principal river to his own abode.
Weary and dispirited, he reached his palace gates,
and scarce had arrived at the pomegranate tree when
the faithful chinquis, which had never wholly re-
covered Karadan’s blow, fell dead at his feet. Phan-
tasmion sate upon the ground, and shed tears over the
lifeless bird: but Potentilla came behind him and
cheerily exclaimed, “Weep no more for the dead, but
take thought for the living.” The prince looked up;
“ I have gained the heart of Iarine,” said' he; “ but I
cannot make her my wife because of Glandreth and
Karadan.” Potentilla replied, “Surely my aid has
availed thee somewhat; perchance it may enable thee
to gain still more.”

CHAPTER XXV.
IARINE VISITS THE HOUSE OF MALDERYL IN
COMPANY WITH PENSELIMER. '
WHILE Phantasmion sailed homeward, Iarine was
wandering through the wilds of Tigridia, at every hut
where she obtained food and shelter, inquiring, as if by
chance, concerning the situation of Malderyl’s mansion,
but telling no one that ‘she was thither bound. Could
the sweet feelings and glad thoughts, which she excited
wherever she went among the pastoral people of the
land, have sprung up into visible ﬂowers, it would have
been seen that she left a blooming track behind her,
and, like the sun, drew virtue from the coldest soil.
One evening she entered a green dell between woods,
where a shepherd was conducting his sheep to the fold :
a youth who accompanied her knew this old man, and
having commended her to his care departed, to the great
ditress of the maiden, who feared lest wild beasts should
attack him on his way home as the shades of night
came on. The shepherd tried to lessen her fears by
relating how Ulander of Nemorosa had thinned the tiger
inhabitants of the land; “In these woods,” said he,
“I doubt if a brindled coat remains, for here it was
that the huntsman chief and his comrades procured a
band of tigerlings for Queen Maudra, I wish this
country paid no other tribute to the barren Land of
N

Rocks than that. Here the parents were murdered,
and the young preserved to ﬂesh their teeth on the
subjects of king Phantasmion.” VVhi'le the old man
stood talking to Iarine, describing with lively gestures
the battle of tigers, the braying of horns, the crashing
of boughs, and the yelling of wounded beasts, many of
his sheep, as if glad to steal away from the oft-told tale,
had straggled into the woody glen, which was full of
soft herbage, and Iarine offered to guard the main body
of his ﬂock while he went in search of the truants; so
thanking her for that courtesy, taking a weapon of
defence from_ his girdle, and placing his crook in her
hand, he hastened away. The lovely princess led the
ﬂock slowly onward till she arrived at a stream, which
crossed the dell, and had been swollen by sudden rains
to a torrent : here she paused, waiting for the shepherd,
and, while the sheep eyed the water, thinking, per-
chance of a ford lower down, where they had crossed in
the morning, Iarine’s mind had travelled back to her
father and Albinet, thence to her baby brother, and all
the time was not wholly absent from Phantasmion. At
last she 'began to think that the old man was long
away, and looked up with pleasure when she heard foot-
steps advancing; but he who now stood before her was
more like a king than a rustic swain; his attire,
though black, was costly, his countenance abstracted and
grave. He stopped to look at Iarine, as she lifted up a
dripping lamb which had slipped into the water, and,
seeing that she eyed him anxiously, as if desirous yet
afraid to speak (for indeed she wished to inquire whether
he had seen the shepherd,) his eye lit up with expecta-
tion, and in an eager tone he exclaimed;—“Hast thou

aught to tell me of the silver pitcher? Surely thou art
akin to Anthemmina, for there is something in thy face
like hers.” Iarine was startled at being accosted thus,
but in a few minutes felt assured that she must be in
company with Penselimer of Almaterra. “ I know not
what has become of the silver pitcher ;" she said;
“ would that I could hear tidings of it ! But meantime
I feel anxious lest the shepherd whose ﬂock I am
guarding, may have met some accident in yonder
wood.” “ I trust he has not fallen in with a tiger,”
said the king, “ such a fell beast as lately carried off my
horse at noonday.” Then, taking a javelin from his
belt, he hastened in the direction which Iarine pointed
out, and soon the maiden saw him return followed by
the truant sheep, and bearing in his arms the old shep-
herd, who had fallen down a ravine, formed by a recent
ﬂood, and so disabled himself. He directed Iarine to a
shallower part of the stream where her ﬂeecy charge
were able to pass over. She penned the sheep in the
fold while Penselimer carried their owner to his cottage ;
then, repairing to that rustic abode, she assisted the
shepherd's daughter to tend his wounds and prepare the
evening meal.
Penselimer sate beside the hearth, seeing forms in
the ﬁre which appeared to no one but himself; for as
soon as he had placed the old man in safety, his thoughts
had all ﬂown back to the silver pitcher. When Iarine’s
employment was over, and she too sate down, he
offered, out of courtesy, to guard her during the rest of
her journey, and hearing in what direction she must
proceed, declared that he should lose no time in attend-
ing her, as the'way she spoke of would bring him to the

house of Malderyl, whither he desired to go. There was
a damsel in the cottage, who had bashfully drawn back
when the strangers entered; while Iarine was helping
the shepherd lass, she took the maiden's wheel into a
corner and span; but hearing Penselimer speak in a
low voice of Malderyl, she stayed both hand and foot,
and leaned forward to catch the words of his discourse.
Iarine, then ﬁrst beholding her countenance by the ﬁre
light, felt a sudden glow of alarm, so much did it
resemble that of Karadan: the passionate black eye,
the brow, the dark skin, all seemed his, and just such a
green and crimson roll as he commonly wore, concealed
her locks. The shy damsel seeing herself noted,
resumed her spinning, and Iarine smiled at her own
suspicion when she saw her thus quietly employed.
Early the next morning the princess went forth again
in company with Penselimer, who related the story of
his unfortunate love for Anthemmina; then at length
she understood how her own fate depended on the silver
pitcher, and saw that Karadan had told no feigned tale
when he showed it her upon the Island. Penselimer
did not observe her sorrowful countenance, but continued
talking of himself. “It is strange,” said he, with the
smiling face of a child that wears his newest, ﬁnest
suit; “ that I, who am the most unhappy among men,
should be the envy of beings who dwell on high. The
truth is, they hate me on account of Anthemmina, fore-
seeing that I shall regain her love if I can but ﬁnd the
pitcher. Therefore. they watch me with their bright
eyes incessantly ; and even at this hour, though I cannot
see them, I well know that they are keenly observing
me.” Iarine cast up her blue eyes to the sky, with a

look of pity and wonder. “Their unheard-of persecu-
tions,” added he, “ excited the compassion of the veiled
lady Melledine, who bade me repair to her sister
Malderyl, and gave me good hope that, through her, I
should regain what I had lost.” The maiden rejoiced
on hearing Melledine’s name, and surmised that Pen-
selimer was to recover his lost senses by means of the
blessed spring of which she herself was in search.
The travellers rested at noon beside a stream, and
Iarine sought to persuade her companion that the
notions which he dwelt upon were shadows of no sub-
stance, echoes of no sound, like those sights and voices
which the disordered eye and ear create within them-
selves, unmoved by any outward thing. But Penselimer
calmly replied : “ Sweet lady (for it is plain to me that
thou art no shepherdess), if the mirror of my mind did
indeed play false, as thy speech infers, how vain it were
to lay the truth before me ! For I must either be in-
capable of seeing it at all, or must see it distorted and
discoloured through the ﬂaws and stains of the glass.
That Anthemmina dwells in yonder sky seems to me as
plain as that I view thy beauteous face, and heard thee
just now declare that she lies under the wave. But this
is one of the tricks of my persecutors: go where I may,
a report has still preceded me that I am mad.” Just as
Penselimer spoke thus, a fawn gambolled past Iarine;
the damsel was tempted to pursue it a little way down
the stream, and, running by a leafy covert, she caught a
glimpse of the brown girl, who span at the cottage;
but passing that way again she saw no one there.
The travellers went on their way, and Iarine, ﬁnding
that all the thoughts which a sane mind can suggest to

one that is diseased will take the hue of the receptacle,
as colourless waters turn blue or green when poured into
certain channels, rather sought, by gentle ingenuity, to
make him conceive happy imaginations, than presented
them to him, and no longer combated errors which were
_as invulnerable as they were easy to hit. Both rested
at a goatherd’s cottage that night, and, in passing
through the little orchard attached to it, when she set
forth early the next day, Iarine beheld the dark maiden,
wrapped in a cloak and sleeping under a tree. The
swarthy cheek and black eyebrow again ﬁxed her atten-
tion, but, as she gazed, the girl awoke, and, beholding
Iarine, covered her face with her garment. Penselimer
now joined his fair comrade, and the maiden, in some
perplexity, pursued her way. At noon she beheld the
house of Malderyl, situate on the lowest ridge of a
conical mountain, which towered alone upon the plain,
and showed from its rugged brow on one side pastoral
plains, interspersed with Woods and hollow glades, full of
giant reeds and tree-like ferns, on the other the endless
forest of Nemorosa, which Glandreth had never subdued.
The mansion itself and the wall around it were 'hewn
out of a rock. “Whither shall I conduct thee 1” said
Penselimer to his companion when they reached the foot
of the hill. “ I must go whither thou art going,” she
said, “even to the house of Malderyl; for I too seek
the presence of the ancient queen, but was bound
not to speak of this till I approached her thresh-
old." Penselimer blew a horn which hung at the
outer gate of the mansion, as soon as he reached
it, and started at the loud sound which ensued, and
which all the rocks above and below echoed. A raven ﬂew

from a beetling crag overhead, just as a rugged churl
admitted the strangers: other domestics then appeared
and conducted them to the apartment where their mis-
tress sate at the summit of a tower. Malderyl was
. seated in a carved chair, the brown arms and upright
back of which resembled her own ﬁgure, dried and
stiffened, but not enfeebled by age. Her face appeared
of bronze, all but the rapid eye, like a lambent ﬂame,
shining and restless ; her heart was dead as the leathern
girdle that covered it, her brain ever in motion, like the
sands of the hour-glass that stood before her on the table.
She was clad in robes of purple and scarlet, and wore
upon her head a crown of golden spikes. Iarine felt
appalled when Malderyl desired that Penselimer would
wait in the ante-room while she conferred with the
maiden, but, summoning courage, presented an ivory
tablet on which her name was inscribed, with curious
cyphers underneath. Malderyl, after a glance at the
writing, told her that she must go alone to the spring
and impart the secret to no one. The maiden having
agreed to this condition, she placed in her hand a light
bucket and chain with a leathern bottle, at the same
time giving her certain directions, and Iarine took her
leave with many thanks, delighted to think how much
of the precious water the skin would contain. No sooner
was she out of hearing than Malderyl turned her keen
eyes on the melancholy king, who had entered at one door
as Iarine disappeared by another. “Penselimer,” she
said, “he who robs thee of thy right is Phantasmion,
king of Palmland." “The son of Dorimant !” he
exclaimed, with kindling eye. On each side of the
queen’s footstool a dwarﬁsh ﬁgure was crouching ; Iarine

had scarcely observed them, and by Penselimer they had
been taken for appendages to the grotesque imagery of
her wooden chair, but when the queen touched one of
them with her foot, up he sprang, and ﬁxed upon
Penselimer a pair of toad’s eyes ringed with scarlet: at
the same instant the other dwarf raised his pointed face,
in which the eye-holes were mere points, laid out his
broad ﬂat hands, and put forward the side of his head as
if to hear rather than see what was going on. While
Penselimer viewed these objects with surprise, Malderyl
began to mutter, and soon both they and the whole
apartment were obscured, clouds creeping over the
vaulted roof and,veiling the wide crystal windows. A
ﬁery light then rose up on the opposite wall, and Pensel-
imer beheld, in many-coloured ﬂame, a picture of Phan-
tasmion, standing over Karadan, and striving to secure
the enchanted vessel. When the king beheld that
image of Anthemmina’s pitcher in silvery light, he
rushed forward and would have clutched it from the wall ;
but, lo! it was impalpable as ﬁres that hover over a
marsh, and a loud puﬂing noise arose from below, that
seemed to be an expression, either of pain or mockery.
Thereat Penselimer, looking down, espied the toad-like
dwarf, whose body he had squeezed against the wall,
with his great mouth wide open, and a slimy liquid
oozing from every pore of his wrinkled skin. A hollow
laugh echoed from the chair of Malderyl, who was
wrapped in darkness, and the crystal windows of the
tower tinkled with her mirth. “ Is it thus thou
rewardest those that serve thee, noble monarch?” she ‘
said. “Swartho has shown thee thine enemy by the
power of his art, and in return thou art trampling him

under foot." Penselimer drew back, and was incensed,
when he recognised the face of Phantasmion, to ﬁnd that
the youth, to whom he had related his story, was King
Dorimant’s son, not doubting that he had visited hiin
solely to obtain an account of the silver pitcher.
“ Transport me to Palmland,” exclaimed the king, “ and
furnish me with armour.” “ Nay," answered the crafty
witch, “ if thou goest now to Palmland, thou wilt miss
thine enemy, and in case of meeting him on the road
wouldst fail to know him, for he is disguised by the
Fairy Potentilla.” “ Show me his likeness,” rejoined the
king, “as he appears at this moment." The sorceress
bade Swartho comply with that request, and straightway
he brought so strange a phantom before the eyes of
Penselimer, so all unlike any adversary which he had
ever dreamt of, that for a moment he stood aghast.
But, ere the grim ﬁgure faded away, and light once more
succeeded to darkness, his courage returned, and, kneel-
ing before the ancient queen, he besought her to arm
him, so that he might ﬁtly encounter such a formidable
foe. “ What guerdon shall I have from thee for such
service ?” inquired Malderyl. “ What wouldst thou
have 1” the king replied. “If thou conquerest Phan-
tasmion,” said the queen, “ thou shalt bestow half of
Palmland on my young kinsman Ulander.” The king
willingly acceded to this proposal, and also agreed that
if he died without issue, Ulander should inherit Alma-
terra. In a little time afterwards Malderyl had pro-
vided him with a horse and armour, and a plumed
casque, as like as possible to those of Glandreth, whose
stature was scarce loftier than his own, and bade him
repair to the mansion of that aspiring chief, on the con-

ﬁnes of Rockland, Tigridia and Almaterra. “By the
time that thou arrivest there,” said she, “ Phantasmion
will have reached the same place, under a feigned
character, for the sake of encountering the great enemy
of his kingdom in single combat Thou shalt bear a
letter from me to Glandreth ; he will easily be persuaded
to let thee accept the challenge in his name, when he
knows that thou, being furnished with enchanted armour,
in addition to thy own great skill and might, art more
certain to defeat the King of Palmland even than his
valiant self.”
Thus forewarned, Penselimer departed, full of joy and
conﬁdence, expecting soon to have the disposal of Phan-
tasmion’s life and kingdom, and to obtain the more
valuable pitcher for himself.

CHAPTER XXVI.
IARINE HAS A FEARFUL ADVENTURE on THE MOUNTAIN.
MALDERYL was sitting under the outer wall of her
abode, looking after the king of Almaterra, as he rode
down the hill, when the dark damsel kneeled at her
feet and placed in her hand a withered branch.' “ Thou
comest from Melledine !” said Malderyl ; “ who art thou,
and what has passed betwixt thee and the veiled lady ?”
“ I am Zelneth; daughter of Magnart,” said'the damsel,
taking the roll from her head, and letting her jetty ringlets
fall down to her waist. “ This is not my natural colour,”
added she,‘ putting up her white hand to her swarthy
cheek; “ I stained my face that no one might know me
as I travelled to thy house. Melledine I met with on the
King’s Island, and she sent me to thee.”' “ Wherefore ?"
said Malderyl, feigning ignorance of what she knew full
well. “ To ﬁnd my sister Leucoia,” replied Zelneth,
while a bright blush glowed through her tawny mask.
“ Then return to thy home,” said Malderyl, “for there
thou wilt be more likely to learn tidings of Leucoia than
here.” Zelneth cast her eyes on the ground, as she
replied in a whisper, “ Where can I learn tidings of
Phantasmion, son of Dorimant? I do confess that for
his sake also I am come to thee.” Malde1_'yl’s searching
glance was now exchanged for a look which encouraged
Zelneth to proceed in her disclosure : she told the story

of her love for Phantasmion, and how she had set forth
to free him from prison. “ It was midnight,” she said,
“ when we reached the Island, and straightway, repairing
to the darksome vault, and putting the key into the
lock, I found the bolts already withdrawn. I descended
and sought in all the subterranean chambers, but found
no trace of him whom I hoped to meet. Just as I
emerged from the vault my lamp threw its light on a
lady covered with a veil which gleamed in the darkness.
“ Dost thou seek Phantasmion of Palmland ?” she said ;
“ this morning his prison door was unlocked by the king’s
daughter." Then I knew that Iarine had deceived me,
and, recollecting the lofty’ mountaineer who kept by her
side in the wood, I clearly saw for what reason she had
sent me away. While I was weeping on my pillow that
night, the veiled lady entered my room, and offered me
a cup, one draught from which, as she averred, would
make me cease to love and cease to feel such sorrow.
But starting up I promptly answered, “ Ask me not to
drown the remembrance either of those I love or those
I hate : rather offer me a charm by which I may gain
the heart of Phantasmion, and triumph over my false
rival.” Then she bade me repair to thee in secret,
bearing a token from her, and placing awithered branch
in my hand she left me to repose. Early the next
day I sought Leucoia, but she was nowhere to be
found, and I could not doubt that she drank of the for-
getful cup and followed Melledine. In all haste I
crossed the mountains, and travelled on to the house of
a shepherd in Tigridia. There I dismissed all my
attendants, bidding them repair to Arzene, and tell
her that I hoped soon to return home with my brother

and sister. I had not long been under the shepherd’s
roof when King Penselimer and the princess Iarine
arrived at the same cottage. Alas ! even here perhaps,
the daughter of Anthemmina has forestalled me, and‘ I
cannot weep with sweet Leucoia, for she has been car-
ried away!” Tears ﬂowed down the face of Zelneth,
streaking the stains that hid her lovely skin. Malderyl
smiled: “Have no fear,” she said, “touching Iarine and
Leucoia: neither shall cross thy path.” “ But is Leucoia
safe and happy '{” said Zelneth, tenderly. “ Safer than
a pearl ﬁve fathoms deep,” said Malderyl; “ and happy
enough, though not so blest as thou shalt be ere long,
come with me to my cavern in the forest ; and if I do
not quickly bring Phantasmion to thy feet, in that
secret dwelling, I will hide my head there for the re-
mainder of my life.” Zelneth trode on air when she
heard Malderyl speak thus : she washed herself white in
a pure fountain, and joyfully accompanied the sorceress
queen to her cave in the woods.
Iarine meantime wound along the mountain, scarce
pausing for a moment to survey the sylvan prospect
before her, but going steadily on till she found the well,
in a hollow betwixt two rocky ridges. This dale was
clothed with herbage, converted into stone by the over-
ﬂowings of the spring; and the breeze when it swept
the valley, stirred not a leaf that grew there. J oyfully
the maiden smiled when she saw these manifest signs of
the water’s potency, and imagined that it would brace
and strengthen her father's quivering frame even as it
had enabled the tremulous reeds and blades of grass to
stand ﬁrm against the wind. With a fragment of rock
in her hand she ascended the petriﬁed mound that

encased the spring, and, having ﬂung her burden into
the well, kneeled down and listened for the noise de-
scribed by Malderyl, who had told her that the waters
were commonly out of reach; that she must throw a
heavy stone into the pit, whereupon they would gradu-
ally rise higher and higher, till at last they might be
taken up by_ the bucket; that when she heard a noise
like stiﬂed thunder she must listen carefully till it
changed to that of bubbling and hissing; then regard-
less of the fumes which would pour from the mouth of
the pit, she must let down her bucket and ﬁll quickly,
ere the water sank again out of her reach. A.nd now
Iarine has caught the sound, and with a beating heart
she applies her ear close to the opening, in spite of the
hot vapours with which she begins to be enveloped:
such indeed was the effect upon her frame that she felt
as if she must quickly dissolve and trickle into the well
or ﬂoat away to the sky in subtle steam; yet still she
listened, holding her breath lest she should fail. to hear
the sign, and miss the right moment. But, just as the
hissing noise commenced, just as she was about to raise
her head and lower the bucket, a youth leaped forward,
caught her suddenly in his arms, and rushed away to a
distance from the shining mound; and, scarce had he
placed the maiden on her feet, when the volumes of
steam sent forth from the pit were succeeded by a column
of boiling water, which rose higher than the dark rocks
behind it, and, falling in foaming curves quickly deluged
the surrounding vale. The fountain continued to play
before Iarine, mounting higher and higher as if it would
sweep down the clouds,—~a pile of rainbow splendour
with a crest of a thousand feathers as white as snow ;-.-

and, while she watched it in speechless amazement, the
young huntsman gazed upon her face in equal wonder,
and almost equal agitation. “ What didst thou at the
boiling well?” at length he inquired. “I have been
cruelly deceived,” the maid replied, and then began to
relate how she had been beguiled into undertaking her
pilgrimage.
“ One night,” she said, “ I was working for my step-
mother in a lonely tower; the evening shades came on,
I dropped my needle, being unable to distinguish the
colours of the embroidery, and, hearing my silver phea-
sant tap at the window, I hastened to let her in. But,
when I rose, the bird was not at the casement, and look-
ing out, I saw that she had fallen to the ground, with
an arrow in her breast. Then I hastened down the steps
of the tower and bent over my favourite.” “ O, surely,
she revived!” replied the youth, ﬁxing his eyes, full of
tenderest rapture, upon Iarine, as if to say that looks of
pity from her face were enough to heal any wound.
“Nay,” replied the maiden, “ my bird seemed stone
dead ; but, raising my tearful eyes, I saw a lady wrapped
in a shining veil, with a vial in her hand. Pure water
from this tiny vessel she poured on the face of the bird,
when suddenly I saw the glazed eye relume within its
scarlet rim, the ruffled feathers expand and show their
ﬁnest gloss, like silken streamers swollen with the wind,
and, rising from the ground, my graceful favourite took
her highest ﬂight, clearing the tower, and sinking down
into the grove beyond. I turned to thank the lady in
the shining veil, but she was gone, and never again did
I behold her, till one night when I sallied forth to free
a prisoner from the lonely tower.” “ A prisoner !” said

the youth, “ and thou wast going to set him free!”
Iarine blushed as she pursued her story. “On that
night I met the same veiled lady in the grove, betwixt
the castle and the tower: ‘ Wilt thou save strangers,’
she said, ‘ and do nothing for those that are near to thee,
for poor Albinian and his sickly son ?’ Then I besought
her to tell me how 1 might serve them, and she bade me
seek the fountain-head of that water with which she had
restored the dying bird. ‘ How shall I ﬁnd it '4’ ’ I
eagerly replied. ‘ G0 to Queen Malderyl,’ she answered,
‘bearing this token from me; but tell no one whither
thou art bound, or on what errand; unless thou goest in
secret, she will not reveal the salutary spring.’ Then,
placing an ivory tablet in my hand, again she disap-
peared.” “ And didst thou free the prisoner?” the
young huntsman anxiously inquired. Iarine paused,
then answered, “ I trust he is now at liberty, though not
through me.”
grimage,” cried the enamoured youth, “ all for thy
father’s and thy brother’s sake !—and the cruel queen
gave thee that bucket, and would have sent thee to de-
struction ?” “ O for a swift steed !'” cried Iarine, “ to
travel day and night till I reached the Diamanthine
Palace.” “ Come with me !” exclaimed the youth,
seizing her hand, “ even here we are not in safety.”
The maiden now perceived volumes of smoke far above
the watery column; they rose from a high peak, and
soon were changed to spiral ﬂames, which occupied the
vault of heaven just over the foaming fountain. Iarine
kept pace with the speed of her conductor: soon they
reached the grove below the hill where the young hunts-
man had left his horse to follow a goat among the rocks;
“ And thou hast taken this long pil-i

he placed the princess hastily on his steed, and mount-
ing before her, never ceased urging him forward, till he
was in the very bosom of the forest. “We are going
farther from Rockland !” exclaimed the maid, in sorrow.
“ Trust to me,” the youth replied ; “ this way will sooner
bring thee home than to retrace thy steps.” Iarine was
bewildered by the ocean of trees into which they were
launched, but hoped that she should emerge from it in
time, and ﬁnd herself in some territory not far distant
from Rockland. It was almost dark in the shady track
through which the young huntsrnan threaded his way;
he had left his bow near the boiling fountain, so that
the quiver at his shoulder would have been of little
avail, had one of the panthers, whose bright eyes glared
from under the dark branches, felt courage for an attack ;
but at his approach they bounded away, leaping from
tree to tree. At last Iarine began to catch bright gleams
and moving objects through the foliage, and soon her
conductor came upon the skirts of a wide pleasure ground,
on the slope of a hill crowned by a goodly palace, which,
from glittering spires and gay enamelled windows, re-
ﬂected the rays of the sun, just then about to sink on
the opposite woody horizon. Below the mansion were
hanging gardens of rich ﬂowers, intersected with rivulets,
which ran among the beds of roses, like tears down a
bright blushing face. On a lawn at the foot of the hill
a band of youths and maidens were dancing: these had
no sooner espied the noble huntsman than they came
forward in a body to cast their wreaths at his feet, and,
by their festive cries and salutations, Iarine learned that
her companion was Ulander, chief of Nemorosa. The
maiden entered his dwelling still beguiled by hopes that
O

she was on the way to Rockland, but soon discovered
that her being restored to the arms of her father
depended on a condition which even love for him could
never strengthen her to fulﬁl. As Ulander’s bride she
might revisit her native country, but else was doomed
to brook the fruitless penance of distasteful courtship in
a foreign land. Day after day she complied with every
request of her adorer, save that alone to which all his
petitions tended; she ﬂew by his side on the light
steed, pierced the pard, or lynx, or savage deer, and,
while the forest rang with praises of the graceful
huntress, and Ulander, kneeling, declared that she
excelled in skill and courage even as in loveliness, the
gentle maiden longed to ﬂy with those she pursued, and
either escape or perish. From her chamber in Ulander’s
palace she looked out over the undulating forest of
Nemorosa, which appeared like a wavy ocean ﬁxed in
stillness by an enchanter’s wand: for gold or silver
gleams, when the sun shone, there was a gilded verdure,
and, when the breezes blew, for ocean’s purple frown, a
ripple of green leaves. But care darkened the shadows
of the scene for her, and sickening hope tinted the
mellow foliage. Now she thought of Phantasmion; of
him she had so resolutely quitted, whose pursuit she had
almost feared; now she repined at that multitude of
trees, which seemed to interpose an end!ess barrier
betwixt them, and gazed for hours on the woodland
prospect, still faintly hoping, deeply longing, to see him
‘ rise with the morning star from the skirts of the forest,
or sail from the golden east with brightened wings over
the green expanse.
On a tuftedknoll behind the palace Ulander was

carving Iarine’s name upon a cypress with a spear’s point,
when, hearing her soft voice among the trees beyond,
he dropped the implement, and, resting his head against
a bough, listened with grieved heart to these numbers :—-
He came unlook’d for, undesir’d
A sun-rise in the northern sky:
More than the brightest dawn admir’d,
To shine and then for ever ﬂy.
His love, conferr’d without a claim,
Perchance was like the ﬁtful blaze,
Which lives to light a steadier ﬂame,
And, while that strengthens, fast decays.
Glad fawn along the forest springing,
Gay birds that breeze-like stir the leaves,
Why hither haste, no message bringing,
To solace one that deeply grieves?
Thou star that dost the skies adorn,
So brightly heralding the day,
Bring one more welcome than the morn,
Or still in night's dark prison stay.

CHAPTER XXVII.
PHANTASMION GOES TO FIGHT GLANDRETH AND
_ ENCOUNTERS PENSELIMER.
“WHILE Phantasmion seeks Iarine, Glandreth shall
conquer the Land of Psalms !” “ Surely,” thought the
young monarch, “ Oloola is secretly on my side, and
those words, which were blown to my ear as with the
blast of a trumpet, were meant to give me warning.
Not only this kingdom but Iarine herself will never be
securely mine while my enemy lives and triumphs.”
After a conference with Potentilla he informed his
council that, as Glandreth alone endangered the safety
of the realm, and to conquer him would be to extinguish
the war at once, he had resolved on defying him to
single combat, and purposed to announce himself, in the
challenge, as a puissant warrior, sent by the king of
Palmland to encounter the mighty general of Albinian.
He had already given orders for raising an army, and
guarding the sea coast with a numerous ﬂeet; there
were hosts of brave men at his disposal, but the want of
metal armour was one which no ingenuity could supply,
and rendered his subjects ill ﬁtted to contend with the
men of Rockland, who had iron without as well as ﬁrm
sinews within. This consideration only heightened
Phantasmion’s desire to encounter Glandreth, and seeking
the pomegranate tree, at the ﬁrst peep of dawn, he

besought Potentilla to produce that powerful armour
with which she had offered to furnish him. She struck
the earth, and brought before the eyes of Phantasmion
a pair of warrior ants which fought ferociously till both
were exhausted. “ How sayest thou ?” said Potentilla;
“wilt thou be armed like these pugnacious insects?”
The youth having readily consented, she laid her wand
upon his head, then bade him strike it with his dagger.
He did so, and found it perfectly impenetrable; but,
looking with eager curiosity into a clear pool near by,
he started at the portentous shadow of his insect helmet,
It displayed a moveable crest in the shape of jagged
awl-shaped jaws, with which, if other weapons failed, a
terrible wound might be inﬂicted, while the face and
breast of the wearer appeared to be cased in a substance
tough as horn, yet hard as brass. The youth was still
surveying his ﬁgure, not without dismay, little thinking
that the picture of it was at that same moment before
the eyes of Penselimer in the house of Malderyl, when
Potentilla placed in his hand the sting of a scorpion
increased to the size of the largest scimetar, and taught
him how the fearful weapon was to be used. “But
thou wilt rid me of this disguise as soon as the ﬁght is
over?” said Phantasmion. Potentilla smiling replied,
“It might stand thee in good stead whither thou art
going. Malderyl has a young kinsman who pursues fair
damsels more earnestly than the bright-eyed antelope
and silver-coated hind. The constancy of thy mistress
may be strongly assailed in the country of Ulander.”
“How sayest thou?” exclaimed Phantasmion, but the
fairy disappeared, leaving him wrapped in thought and
gazing on vacancy, till the sting of an ant upon his

right foot admonished him to set off without delay.
Forthwith he concealed his face and the upper part of
his body with a mask and a cloak, which, at the fairy’s
suggestion, he had brought to the interview, mounted
his horse, and through rugged passes among the Black
Mountains travelled toward the house of Glandreth.
His adversary, meantime, had been pondering over
the deﬁance from Palmland, when 'Penselimer arrived
bearing the letter of Malderyl. On perusing this crafty
epistle, Glandreth was well content that the king of
Almaterra should stand in his place, and ﬁght his enemy
with charmed weapons, resolving in the meanwhile to
lead his well-trained forces into the realm he so much
desired to invade. He would not even await the event
of the conﬂict, but stole away, after pompously accepting
the challenge, and, while Phantasmion was traversing
Rockland, Glandreth was on his way to the Land of
Palms.
The combatants met on a wide plain before Gland—
reth’s castle, in the presence of a large assembly. Phan-
tasmion looked at the sky, and satisﬁed himself that it
was perfectly clear; then he cast his eyes on his.adver-
sary, and thought that Glandreth, though of noble port
and stature, was by no means so broad-built a man as he
had formerly imagined. The king of Almaterra, mean-
time, could scarce turn his attention from Phantasmion’s
woollen cloak, which lay on the ground; for though it
was only wrapped about the serpent wand, and a silver
cup, he imagined that it concealed nothing less than
Anthemmina’s pitcher. But now the trumpet sounded,
and great was the astonishment both of Phantasmion
and an amphitheatre of spectators, to see Penselimer’s

panoply drip all over, then fall into furrows; and, lastly,
trickle away in many a bubbling stream, as if he were
but a waxen warrior, and melted at the very breath of
his antagonist. Such was the effect of Malderyl’s trea-
chery, such the power of her muttered charm, that Pen-
selimer quickly stood bare in the sight of all men, his
helmet with its visor and his uplifted blade alone remain-
ing for a season ﬁrm. When drops began to fall from
the end of that weapon also, he indignantly rushed upon
Phantasmion; but no sooner had he felt the point of
the scorpion sword, than, uttering a loud cry, he sank
senseless on the ground, with the magic weapon sticking
fast in his side.
At the same moment that he fell, Phantasmion’s fairy
accoutrements vanished, and, when with loud shouts
Penselimer was removed from the ﬁeld, he procured
fresh armour, and challenged every warrior present to
stand in Glandreth’s place; but all declining the com-
bat, he forthwith departed to roam in search of Iarine.
And now that deeds of arms no more engaged his
thoughts, they centred wholly in that fair and pious
maid, whose image beamed on all sides of his solitary
path; and this was one of many strains with which he
addressed her:
Yon clmngeful cloud will soon thy aspect wear—
So bright it grows :—and now, by light winds shaken,
O ever seen yet ne’er to be o'ertaken!
Those waving branches seem thy billowy hair.
The cypress glades recall thy pensive air;
Slow rills, that wind like snakes amid the grass,
Thine eye’s mild sparkle ﬂing me as they pass,
Yet murmur-ing cry, This fruitless quest forbear!

CHAPTER XXVIII.
PHANTASMION IS nmuunnn IN MALDERYL'S CAVE. _
PHANTASMION pursued the same track which his gentle
princess had taken through Tigridia, and excited curiosity
in all who beheld him by his noble aspect and kingly
air. The ﬁrst discourse of his cottage hosts was ever
concerning the fair pilgrim, Iarine, and this tale was
sure to be followed by an animated history of Ulander
as its counterpart. Phantasmion glowed and trembled
when he heard those names wedded in description, and
scarce dared inquire about N emorosa lest he should hear
some unwelcome eulogy on the graces of its youthful
chief. Thus he fared, tracing his lady’s footsteps to
the house of Malderyl, where he learned that the
ancient queen had repaired to the forest with a most
beautiful maiden. His heart beat higher than ever at
this intelligence : a most beautiful maiden could be no
other than Iarine, and it seemed plain as the sun at
noon-day that Malderyl was bent on securing so rich
a prize for her young kinsman Ulander. He wound
along the bottom of the mountain, and left his horse,
before night-fall, at the cottage of a goatherd, thinking
that he could best proceed on foot through the tangled
forest to ﬁnd Malderyl’s_ retreat. Provided as he was
with good armour, and dauntless courage, he feared
neither man nor beast, but anxious thoughts and sur-

2 1 8 ’ P/zantasmiorz
mises crowded on his mind, like swarms of stinging
gnats, the pertinacity of which no efforts were suﬂicient
to repel. Just as his mental fever had reached its
height, and had begun to bring, even before his visual
eye, a graceful huntsman kneeling at the feet of Iarine,
in whose face a smile seemed to dawn, but Whether of
cold courtesy or nascent love he vainly strove to dis-
tinguish,-——a voice whispered, seemingly from under-
ground, “Dost thou seek Iarine? she dwells with Ulander:
and—the loveliest of all maidens is in Malderyl’s cave.”
Phantasmion shivered, and an instant afterwards his
veins could scarce contain their scalding currents.
“ Iarine with Ulander in Malderyl’s cave!” “Surely,”
thought he, “ that was not the mere voice of my deli-
rium.” Then he began to rave and shout aloud, as if the
forest’ could hear him, “ Where is the cave? where is
the cave? _ O these huge trees, that stretch their giant
arms, and point on all sides, how they too madden me !”
Flinging away his cloak, he rushed on wildly till he was
stopped by close underwood, growing over a swamp.
Here again a voice rose to his ear, crying, “ Iarine
dwells with Ulander; seek the beauty in Malderyl’s
cave.” Phantasmion now looked down and perceived a
strange ﬁgure, but could not see either its form or
features clearly from the dimness of the place. ' “D0
thou show me the way, whoever thou art,” cried the
youth, franticly waving his sword. At these words
Malderyl’s toad-like dwarf leaped from amid the bushes,
and skipped on before Phantasmion, who followed him
till the shadowy path was faintly illumined by what
appeared in the distance like two huge eyes of ﬁre.
“ Those are openings in front of Malderyl’s rocky tene-

detained in Malderyl’s awe. 2 I9
ment,” said the dwarf; “their light will guide thee
thither.” Phantasmion looked athis good steel blade,
then hastened on, and entered the cavern by a winding
passage. He paused at the threshold, and saw no
graceful hunter youth, but a wrinkled crone, in queenly
attire, bending over the ﬂames of a well-heaped hearth,
and carefully inspecting the contents of a wide vessel,
which simmered amid the blaze, and ﬁlled the cave
with odorous inebriating fumes. Beside her stood the
glowing and beautiful Zelneth, her glossy raven locks
carelessly ﬂung back from her white forehead, and her
splendid eyes intent upon the work that was going on.
She held in both hands a crystal bowl, into which
Malderyl began to pour some of the rosy liquid scooped
from the cauldron, when Phantasmion appeared and
caused such alarm in the damsel’s mind, that the vessel
would have fallen to the ground, if her companion had
not taken it from her. “ King of Palmland,” said the
aged queen, “ thou art welcome; be seated, and take
off thy cumbrous armour.” Muttering within herself
she touched the head of the youth, as he bent forward
to look after Zelneth, who had retreated to the inner
part of the cave, when his crested helmet vanished, and
soon the hyacinthine locks and goodly countenance of
Phantasmion were revealed by the red light of the
ﬂames. Then Zelneth uttered a cry of astonishment
and exclaimed, “ O Malderyl! is this a delusion of
magic, or do I look upon the very face of him I love ?”
“ Dost thou still love Phantasmion, best and loveliest ?”
cried the youth, rushing forward to throw himself on
his knees, his whole soul possessed with the image of
Iarine; but, looking up and beholding Zelneth, her

2 20 P/umtasmion
bright face beaming with transport, her fair form almost ’
appearing to expand from the joy of her bosom, he
started away with a countenance of deep disappointment!
“Ze1neth, daughter of Magnart !" he exclaimed, in a
sorrowful tone; “O tell me, hast thou lately seen thy
kinswoman Iarine ?” The damsel turned away without
speaking, and, while tears gushed between the ivory
ﬁngers that strove to conceal them, Malderyl, who still
bent over the cauldron answered in her stead. “ Iarine
was gaily hunting the deer,” said she, “by the side
of her betrothed Ulander, when Zelneth came to
my house in search of Leucoia Iarine, pretending
to serve her parent, deserts him for a lover, while
this maiden faces a thousand dangers for her sister’s
sake, and loves with constancy, though hopeless of a
return.” Zelneth ﬂung her white arms around Mal-
deryl, and, hiding her head, she gently cried with half
suppressed sobs, “O speak no more! Phantasmion will
win back his beauteous bride, and Zelneth would rather
die than trouble his happiness.” The youth’s brain had
been half unsettled by feverish suspicions together with
bodily fatigue, and now the steams of the liquor doubled
its confusion: he turned away and would have rushed
out into the forest, to seek his rival, but the cavern
appeared to be full of passages winding in every direc-
tion, and he found it impossible to hit upon the one by
which he had entered. “ Take thy rest here to-night,”
said Malderyl ; “thou wilt never ﬁnd the Sylvan Palace
in the dark, and to-morrow, or a month hence, Iarine
may still be found at the house of Ulander,-—if thou
must indeed go ﬁght for that gathered lily, with tar-
nished leaf and tainted fragrance.” At another time

a’etaz'nea' in Malderyl’s awe. 22 I
Phantasmion would have ﬂamed at those words like a
ﬁre fresh fuelled, but now the luscious vapours were
stealing over his senses; he was gazing unconsciously
upon Zelneth, as she stood a little behind Malderyl with
arms pensively crossed and downcast face, shaded on
each side by drooping locks. He retired to a recess in
the cavern, and tried to think again his former thoughts
and purposes; but insensibly they ﬂoated away. His
rage against Ulander seemed to dissolve, or turn into its
opposite, and he vainly sought to keep ﬁrm hold of that
or any other feeling. Zelneth approached with the
crystal basin in her hands,‘ and said to him, as he sate
in the shadow, “ Malderyl has been preparing a precious
liquor for my beloved parents, it takes away all sense of
toil and pain.” She stood with her face half turned
away, yet holding the vessel within Phantasmion’s reach.
He put out his hand towards it, gazing all the time on
the damsel ; but with a sudden effort, he drew it back
again, and turned his face to the rocky wall. Zelneth
sipped the liquid, then cried to the aged woman, who
was busy about the ﬁre, stirring and skimming the
cauldron. “ Malderyl, add nothing more; it cannot be
better. I will fetch the jars in which it must stand
this night.” She left the crystal basin on a table of
rock, just opposite to Phantasmion: he saw the liquor
lie glowing and creaming in the bowl, like melted rubies
frothed with pearl; he inhaled its sweet bewildering
odour, and, scarce knowing what he did, the youth raised
' it to his lips and drank deeply. In a moment he was
electriﬁed with delight, a rapturous tranquillity pervad-
ing his whole frame: he felt intoxicated with pleasure
which sprang from no cause and tended to no object, yet

was ever ready to be reﬂected and multiplied from all
objects around: he seemed incapable of thinking, and
happier than any thought could make him. Zelneth
returned from the further part of the cavern, bringing
jars in her hand; in the eyes of the spell-bound prince,
she now appeared to be gloriﬁed by a supernatural light
of beauty ; joy streamed from every line of her face and
form into the joyful heart of the prince, as light shoots
from the surface of smooth water back towards its
heavenly source. All thought of Zelneth, all thought
of Iarine, all remembrance of the past, all anticipation
of the future, were completely suspended : he only knew
that he was gazing on a sun of loveliness, in which a
thousand beauties seemed to converge, While the feelings
inspired by his own heavenly maid’ were mingled with
his new sensations, though the object of them was
veiled in his memory by a dazzling mist. Zelneth re-
tired again into the dark recess to fetch more vessels,
while Phantasmion, reclining on a smooth low rock, with
his head sunk into a mossy hollow, beheld fantastic
petrifactions, which hung from the ceiling, illuminated
by the ﬁre-light. He gazed upon them in ecstacy, and
felt as if the transport of his bosom, which invested
them with splendour, was derived from these unmeaning
forms, till Zelneth, again presenting herself, occupied his
whole fancy, and seemed once more to be the fountain
of all his glad sensations. The damsel now ventured to
cast her eyes upon him, and, seeing the bowl by his
side, was sure that he had drunk the charmed liquor;
eagerly she perused his countenance, and, reading the
deepest fascination of love in every line of it, she let the
jar fall upon the ﬂoor. “ He is mine !” she whispered,

clasping her hands; “ O, Malderyl, is this all thy work? ‘
Have I no part in it? But will not the enchantment
fade? Will Phantasmion love Zelneth forever?” He
heard the words, and smiled on her who spoke them,
but spoke not himself, his eyes being heavy with sleep.
As an infant lies in its cradle, watching every motion of
her whom he loves fondly, but unconsciously free_from
the burden of esteem, and obligation of gratitude, so
Phantasmion followed with his eyes the beautiful Zel-.
neth, and saw her prepare a couch for him on the ﬂoor
of the cavern. She heaped up sweet scented withered
leaves, and strewed over them the skins of wolves and
ﬂowing fur of lynxes ; Phantasmion sank down upon the
soft bed, and was speedily wrapped in slumber. Zelneth
kneeled beside him, gazing on his gentle and noble
countenance, as the ﬁre-light irradiated his fair brow,
where all the soft blue veins were traceable under a
smooth surface, and his bright youthful cheek reclining
amid the spoils of savage animals, and surrounded by
the black walls and shadowy hollows of the cavern.
Already she fancied herself the ﬂower-cr0wned bride of
Phantasmion, and breathed in a soft lulling melody this
happy strain :—
I was a brook in straitest channel pent,
Forcing ’mid rocks and stones my toilsome way,
A scanty brook in wandering Well-nigh spent;
But now with thee, rich stream, conjoin'd I stray,
Through golden meads the river sweeps along,
Murmuring its deep full joy in gentlest undersong.
I crept through desert moor and gloomy glade,
My waters ever vex’d, yet sad and slow,
My waters ever steep’d in baleful shade :
But, whilst with thee, rich stream, conjoined I ﬂow,


## p. 224 (#250) ############################################

2 24 Phantasmion
E'en in swift course the river seems to rest,
Blue sky, bright bloom and verdure imag’d on its breast.
And, whilst with thee I roam through regions bright,
Beneath kind love’s serene and gladsome sky,
A thousand happy things that seek the light,
Till now in darkest shadow forc’d to lie,
Up through the illnmin’d waters nimbly run,
To shew their forms and hues in the all revealing sun.
Singing thus she fell asleep, and, when her eyes were
fast sealed in slumber, Phantasmion heard a shrill voice
crying :-—“ Awake, young prince of Palmland, awake !”
He raised his head and saw Malderyl sitting on the
ﬂoor, an urn by her side, a branch of red berries on her
lap, her ﬁngers wet with purple juice. The crown she
lately wore was thrown aside, her eyes shot ﬁre,
and Phantasmion knew that the face he now looked
upon, was the very face of the strange old man, who told
him of his mother’s death. A shadowy form hovers
aloft: it is the spirit of the poisoned child: Phantas-
mion remembers that swollen spotted cheek as if he
had seen it but yesterday. “ Beware, young prince of
Palmland !” the wan spectre cries, and, unmoved at
ll/[alderyl’s awful threats, with sullen eye and obstinate
ﬁnger still points to the purple berries that lie beside
the urn. “ Witch! Murderess !” exclaimed Phantas-
mion, starting up ; but while he strove to free his feet
from the coverings of the couch, Malderyl stirred the
cauldron till fumes ﬁlled the cave, and entered every
pore and inlet of the youth's body. He sank down
again and scarce had pressed the furry pillow, when
Zelneth met his eye, Zelneth, smiling in sleep, her head
inclined ‘on one ivory shoulder and her soft white arm

extended over the skin of a black wolf. The charm
resumed its power, the murderess and the ghastly spectre
vanished from his sight, and dreaming only of lilied
meads, bright streams, and perfect loveliness, he lay in
deep repose within the rugged cavern.

CHAPTER XXIX.
PHANTASMION IS nrsnnonmrnn BY OLOOLA.
F ROM the witch’s cavern subterranean passages con-
ducted into a delicious garden, embosomed in the forest,
and surrounded by a double fence of lofty trees. Here
the prince found himself when he awoke in the morn-
ing: bright wreaths of an acacia bower drooped over
' his head; ﬂowers blushed, and streamlets glittered far
as eye could reach; a‘ splendid picture was hung out
before him, and ‘ Zelneth, placed at coy distance,
appeared the very subject of the piece. Phantasmion
sprang from his odorous couch, and approaching the
damsel, seemed to tread on air. No trace of the warn-
ing vision remained in his memory, and now that the
charm had taken into its alliance the refreshment of
sleep, he was transported with a stil! more exquisite
delirium than on the preceding evening. He felt it to
‘ be his turn‘ to speak, while Zelneth was speechless‘
with happiness, drinking in his ﬂuent love-discourse, as
if it were a rill which ever gratiﬁed, but never removed,
the_pleasurable thirst it excited, while to him their
volubility seemed in itself an enjoyment, and resembled
the soft lapse of the brimming 1'ivulet which wandered
past his feet to visit a thousand ﬂowery knots and
odorous copses. Phantasmion scarce noted anything
stedfastly, or considered whence it arose, or what it

betokened: but sitting by the side of Zelneth, and
pouring himself forth in admiration of her charms, he
ever and anon caught glimpses of Feydeleen’s ﬂower-
like face, darting smiles from corners of the bower, dim
with the shadow of clustered roses, while now and then
her ﬁngers came like a twinkling butterﬂy, and scat-
tered over the head of the delighted maiden a shower
of light petals from the frailest and most transitory
blossoms. Zelneth saw not Feydeleen, nor anything
but Phantasmion: she rose from her seat to fetch a
well-ﬁlled urn, which had been placed in the arbour:
it was the vessel which contained the poisoned juice,
and the moment so long watched for by Malderyl
seemed about to arrive. The sorceress leans forward
overa leafy bough : Phantasmion’s glance for a moment
is diverted from the maid, and that prominent eye-ball,
ﬂashing amid the foliage, brings dim recollections to his
mind; but Malderyl sinks back to her hiding place,
and the youth turns to gaze on Zelneth, who stands
smiling before him, with a crystal goblet in her left
hand. “ Wilt thou drink once more,” she said, “ and
promise to be mine for ever ?” Phantasmion threw
himself on his knees, ready to utter vows of eternal love
and faithfulness, having forgotten those he had made to
Iarine, as if they had been characters formed in ice,
which a hot sun had melted away. At the same
moment, his tongue was arrested and the blood appeared
to stagnate in his veins; the air had become piercing
cold, and ﬁlled with white vapour; the brook ceased
to murmur, and the birds to sing; the waters were
congealed, the leaves and ﬂowers wan and drooping, the
branches encrusted with hoary rime. But the eyes of

2 28 P/zantasmzbn
Phantasmion were ﬁxed on Zelneth! motionless she
stood, one arm raising aloft the urn, from whose lip an
icicle depended, the other holding the empty crystal
goblet, now no longer grasped but glued to the power-
less palm. She was frozen to the ground : the glowing
carnation of her cheek had faded to palest lilac: a
deathy blueness tinged her brow of pear], and crept
over her bosom; wreaths of frost curled around her
stiffened jetty ringlets; her arms looked brittle and
crystalline; while those dark orbs that lately almost
eluded the sight by their lifesome motion, had a dull
shine upon them, like eyes of glass, and seemed ﬁxed in
their marble sockets. Phantasmion would have risen
and approached the damsel, but strove in vain to move
one step nearer to her statue-like form. His heart beat
fearfully, but every other part of his frame was begin-
ning to lose power and sensation: his head was ﬁxed
on one side ; his knee clung to the earth, and no longer
perceived its coldness ; the ﬁngers of his extended hand
were cramped into one, and felt as if they touched each
other through velvet: he seemed to be fast changing
into a form of ice. On a sudden the sky grew black,
showers of stony hail came rushing on between him and
his fair companion, he was wrapped round about in a
sheet of snow, while blasts which he found it impossible
to resist, carried him to the further end of the garden,
prostrated the tall fence of trees with interwoven
branches, and continued to impel him onward for many
a mile and many a league, till at length, when the wind
lulled, he sank upon the open plain far beyond the
Forest of Nemorosa, his blood moving rapidly and his
limbs: stiff with exertion.


## p. 229 (#255) ############################################

disenc/ranted by Oloola. 229
Phantasmion had fallen under the shelter of massy
walls overgrown with ivy, the wreck of a palace where
Trigridia’s monarchs had dwelt from age to age. Here
the husband of Malderyl and her son Sylvalad had been
treacherously murdered when Glandreth invaded the
land, and Maudra her daughter, becoming enamoured of
the blood-stained hero, followed him as a voluntary
‘ captive. The two sons of Sylvalad had been brought
up by the widowed queen; one had perished in a far
country, the other, whose name was Ulander, bore sway
in the woodland fastnesses, where his father had ruled
before him, but was too wild and careless to attempt the
recovery of his whole inheritance. The wind had
relented, the sky was disclosing more and more of its
blue dome, snakes and lizards came forth to glitter in
the sun, and the solitary bird that hides its nest under
grey ruins, sought food in the moistened herbage, enjoy-
ing, amid the desolation of that ancient abode, the
pleasures of a dear though transient home. Still the
breeze lingered round Phantasmion, playing with his
wet robe, and gently shaking the particles of snow from
his redundant locks. Plaintive sounds issued from
different parts of the building, as if a penitent lover
were uttering meek confessions mingled with regret,
and from within the pile some solemn instrument sent
forth a deep slow melody of former days. While it yet
was proceeding the youth heard a voice that seemed to
be just above his head. “ Phantasmion,” it whispered,
“ what dost thou here, while faithful Iarine wanders in
Nemorosa ? ” Soon afterwards the same voice appeared
to come from a higher point, it was accompanied with a.
noise of light wings fanning the air, and to the youth's

anxious ear it seemed to say, “ Phantasmion must seek
Iarine while Glandreth conquers the Land of Palms."
After these words were spoken the solemn music swelled
into a fuller' tone, then sank into silence. Phantasmion
started up and saw the pinnacles of the ediﬁce gilded,
here and there, by partial beams, which struggled forth
from amid disorderly heaps of dark vapour. Just
beyond the battlements of a black tower, he beholds
transparent pinions, spread to their vast extent, with
the sun glittering through them. A moment afterwards
they recede; Oloola dives among the clouds on which
those golden wings shed radiance. On she goes, sweep-
ing the sky, as a shearer sweeps away the ﬂeeces of the
new-shorn ﬂock; and now she is indistinguishable from
the mass that moves along with her, and now both she
and the clouds themselves are gone, leaving the cope of
heaven pure and resplendent, as if it were cut out of a
single sapphire, through which a powerful sun was
pouring its diffusive light. *

CHAPTER XXX.
ZELNETH IS CARRIED T0 THE SYLVAN PALACE, WHITHER
PHANTASMION GOES IN SEARCH OF IARINE.
THE storm which followed that intense frost had beaten
on the rigid form of Zelneth unfelt, unseen; but now
the charm was broken, the stony locks fell loose, all
gemmed with dewdrops gleaming in the soft sunlight,
'and, even as thawing streams break forth into sound
and motion, so the damsel moved and spoke once more,
and sparkled with returning life. She roamed about
the garden where Feydeleen had revived the drooping
ﬂowers, and breathed new vigour ‘into their languid
stems. The fairy looked at her pitifully from amid the
leaves, and fondly whispered, “Kings shall sue for
Zelneth, and Zelneth shall cause the ardent lover to
forget his ﬁrst love.” The maiden heard not, heeded
not, but continued her weeping, or murmured laments
like these :—
By the storm invaded
Ere thy arch was wrought,
Rainbow, thou hast faded
Like a gladsome thought,
And ne’er may’st shine aloft in all ear-th’s colours fraught.
Insect ti-anced for ever
In thy pendent bed,
Which the breezes sever
From its fragile thread,
Thou ne’er shalt burst thy cell and crumpled pinions spread,

Lily born and nourish’d
’Mid the waters cold,
Where thy green leaves ﬂourish’d,
On the sunburnt mould
How canst thou rear thy stem and sallow buds unfold?
Snowy cloud suspended
O’er the orb of light,
With its radiance blended ‘
Ne’er to glisten bright,
It sinks, and thou grow’st black beneath the wings of night.
Malderyl had been stricken to the earth by the rapid
tempest, and there she lay muttering and making
hideous faces : the green-vested fairy gleamed past her,
as a lizard glances past a fallen log, then, pointing with
dewy ﬁnger at Zelneth, “Malderyl," she said, “when
wilt thou weep again? Ah! thou art old and sapless,
past the luxury of tears.”
A harsh voice uttering the name of Iarine caused
Zelneth to raise her head, and looking up she saw the
dwarf Herva seated beside the ancient woman, his sharp
visage turned towards her, and each ﬂat paddle arm
spread out. “How long since ? ” cried Malderyl,
angrily. “Yester morn,” said he, “ I was about to
climb theihigh wall that girds Ulander’s domain, when
lo! the damsel Iarine, armed with bow and quiver,
appeared on the top of it : she saw not me, as I crouch-
ed beneath, but leaped over my head on the soft moss,
then, swift as 'a roe, she darted through the wood."
Zelneth turned away wringing her hands, for she gathered
that Iarine had escaped from Ulander, though she could
not catch all that the dwarf muttered. “And where
hast thou been loitering?” cried Malderyl, ﬁercely; but

the next moment her thoughts were engaged by the
other dwarf, who came limping in, with open mouth, to
tell his tale. “ Mistress,” he said, “ she is at the goat-
herd’s cottage, and her father is there also !” “ How ?”
cried Malderyl, “ the palsied King Albinian ?” “ Even
so,” replied the dwarf; “ strong love, or perhaps the
approach of death, counteracted his disease so far, that
he stole away from the palace, followed Iarine’s foot-
steps, and this morning came to thy house on the hill,
inquiring for his daughter. I guided him to the boiling
fount—” “Right!” cried Malderyl: “he has cum-
bered the earth long enough ; and how did he escape ? "
“ He was saved by his daughter, who had got away
from the Sylvan Palace,” replied Swartho, “ and took
her way across the hill, doubtless because it was the
shortest and best known to her. Entering the stony
dell, she espied Albinian lying just under the mound of
the well, where he had sunk down exhausted. The
maiden rescued him from that dangerous place, dragging
him away in her arms; but, if the goatherd had not
come within call, she would scarce have reached the
bottom of the hill by this time. Now both are under
his roof, and Albinian seems to be on his death-bed.”
“ Didst thou follow them ‘V’ said the witch. “ I should
have done so,” the dwarf answered, “ but, no sooner did
the goatherd relieve Iarine of Albinian’s weight, than
she took the bow from her shoulder, an arrow from the
case, and made this wound in my heel.” The body of
Swartho puffed up as he spoke, and the ﬂaming circle of
his dilated eye appeared to grow wider and redder.
“Coward!” exclaimed Malderyl, with a laugh, “thou
shalt have a worse wound in thy face presently.”

“ Nay, mistress ! hear what.I did further,” replied the
dwarf; “ after a while I repaired to the cottage garden,
and there learned from a boy, who has lived with the
goatherd ever since his wife and child perished together
in a burning shower on the mountain, that Iarine will
be close to the cavern this evening. I know the exact
spot whither she means to repair, a patch of berry-
bearing plants, just under the hollow sycamore, in which
a squirrel has made his nest. She has been once there
already to gather fruit for her father; and, ere it is
dark, she will come again for a fresh supply.” Malderyl
arose. “ Well ! get ye both into the cavern," she said,
“ and be ready when I call.” The dwarfs retired, and
their ancient mistress approached Zelneth, who sate
upon the ground with her streaming locks around her,
silently watering the turf with tears. “ Oloola brought
the frost and raised the storm," said Malderyl; “ she
favours Glandreth and hates his enemies; for his sake
she persecutes the son of Dorimant, and she will separate
him from Iarine as well as from thee. Take courage:
I will devise a plan—” “Away!” cried the damsel,
scornfully; “thou hast neither skill nor foresight. Why
didst thou bring us into the garden under the open sky?
Oloola could have worked us no ill in the cavern.”
Malderyl’s eye lightened at this taunt, but Zelneth saw
not its vengeful ﬂash, and relapsed into silence. Im-
perceptibly, however, as a snow shower changes into
rain, her sullen mood relented, and Malderyl found an
opportunity to propose her plan. “ Iarine,” ‘she said, “is
at the goatherd’s cottage ”—“ Where Phantasmion will
ﬁnd her,” cried Zelneth, impetuously. “He shall never
ﬁnd her again,” repliedithe witch, “ if thou wilt consent

to a brief disguise, and brave a slight peril.” Zelneth
ﬁxed her brightening eyes on her evil counsellor.
“ Thou hast some skill,” she said, while the last tear
fell from her cheek : “ tell me what peril,‘ what disguise
thou art thinking of.” Malderyl brought from the
cavern a panther’s skin. “ It is but to dress thyself in
this gay gar ,” she said ; “ then to sit crouching on the
bough of a tree hard by here, and, when Iarine comes
under it, and is busily engaged in gathering berries,
suddenly to show thyself and leap down by her side. .
When she attempts to ﬂy, thou and the dwarfs shall
intercept her return to the cottage, and I, meantime,
will beckon her into the cavern, whence she shall not
come out till she consents to marry Ulander. My kins-
man shall meet her here, and thou shalt repair to the
Sylvan Palace, where Phantasmion will be sure to go in
search of Iarine.” “ She sent me to the Island,” mur-
mured Zelneth, “to release one who was standing by
her side at that moment.” “ I will take good care that
she shall not escape,” added Malderyl. “Thou shalt see
me run out with a chaﬁng-dish in my hand, to stupify
her senses by the smoke of burning herbs. But come !
either reject the scheme, or prepare to do thy part in it ;
for she will be here presently.” Zelneth took up the
skin,‘without knowing how to put it on, but Malderyl
adjusted it so well that the lady's speaking eyes looked
through holes which had formerly contained the bestial
ones of a panther. Strangely now indeed they sparkled
under a shaggy brow and upright ears, which the
original wearer could move and bend at will. Zelneth
in her childish days had been wont to follow the
squirrels up many a well-branched tree. She loved

to wind her.way among the boughs, overcoming a
series of delightful dangers, till she could place her fairy
foot betwixt the topmost fork, proud to ﬁnd herself
at such a dizzy height, and glad to have in prospect
the pleasing adventure of descent. But such sports
of the vacant mind and lithe limbs had fallen into
disuse, and, though the sycamore was easy to climb,
slowly and timorously she crept up to her lurking
place, and still more violently her heart palpitated
when she saw Iarine approach with her basket, and
kneel down to collect the fruit which grew on tiny
bushes under the tree. While the eyes of the gentle
princess were busily engaged upon the ground, those of
Zelneth, anxious and fearful, were gazing at her from
above. The bough shook as with trembling limbs she
began to creep forward, after the manner of a wild cat,
and all the crisp leaves and branches made a rustling
noise. Iarine started, and looking up espied the pre-
tended panther peeping down from the bough, whence
she had scarce summoned resolution to spring. Unhappy
Zelneth! she had not reckoned on her cousin's newly
acquired skill in archery, nor on that matchless bow,
the amorous chieftain’s gift, which now hung at her
shoulder. On seeing the damsel prepare to shoot she
uttered a loud cry, and strove to turn about, but, ere
she could escape the arrow was in her side. Iarine,
hearing Ulander’s voice’ from a distance, stayed not to
examine the false panther, which had fallen to the
ground, but glided swiftly through the ‘wood, while the
dwarfs, who were stationed to prevent her return, panic-
stricken at what they had witnessed, and at the approach
of the royal huntsman, crouched among the brush-wood,

and Malderyl, her form half hidden by wreaths of smoke
from the censer in her hand, stood laughing at the
entrance of the cave, till at last she fell upon the
ground, overpowered by the fumes she had heedlessly
inhaled. Meantime, Ulander, who had been roaming in
search of his fair fugitive, drew nigh the patch of berry-
. bearing plants, and there found Zelneth, prostrate on
the ground, with the skin of a wild beast covering the
lower part of her body: for by this time she had freed
her head and neck from the cumbrous disguise.
‘ Astonished both by her beauty and the strange state in
which he found her, the youth alighted from his horse,
and asked what savage hand had inﬂicted that wound
in her side, whence the blood was ﬂowing. Zelneth
pointed to the panther’s skin still hanging about her
feet, then sank into a swoon, her disengaged arm falling
powerless on her shaggy spoils. The chieftain forgot
Iarine while he gazed on her fair countenance; he
gently removed the skin, placed the fainting damsel on
his horse, and conveyed her with all care and tenderness
to his princely home. But though the travellers went
at so leisurely a pace, that the night was far gone when
they arrived there, the motion of the horse inﬂamed the
lady’s wound, which would soon have healed but for
this aggravation. Fever seized the hapless maid, and
Ulander found with sorrow that his love had proved as
injurious to Zelneth, as it had been irksome and grievous
to Iarine.
Not long after the chief of Nemorosa reached his
mansion, Phantasmion arrived there also. The inﬂuence
of the magic draught over his spirit had been destroyed
by Oloola’s counteracting spell, the mist dispersed, and

Iarine’s image again shone forth in ‘sunny splendour,
while that of Zelneth, late so radiant, showed like the
vanishing moon with her weak superﬂuous light. But
the last words of Oloola had cast him into a reverie.
Glandreth had fallen by his hand: how then ‘should
Glandreth conquer the Land of Palms?
a hidden meaning, or no meaning at all? He had
heard that Glandreth formerly sued for the hand of
Iarine’s mother, that Oloola loved the bold and beautiful
chieftain, and made a solemn vow to be his friend and
minister till Anthemmina’s dying day. “ And now that
they two are dead,” thought he, “perchance Oloola
befriends Phantasmion; or it may be that, like the
winds of heaven, she follows no settled course, to sport
with human hopes and purposes ‘her only plan.” Raising
his eyes from the ground he saw Malderyl’s mansion
upon the brow of the conical mountain, just visible in
,the distance, and thither he resolved to go and inquire
again for Iarine.‘ On reaching the gate Phantasmion
made the rocks resound with his loud summons, and,
ere the echoes had ceased, the porter and his grisly-
beard stood before him. “Hast thou seen any other
maiden,” cried the youth, “ beside her who went to the
woods with thy mistress?” “ None since she was here,”
the porter replied. “But, just before she arrived,
there came a shepherdess in company with a man of
high degree. Her face was shaded with a hood, and
she went forth alone, having a bucket and a bottle in
her hand. Surprized to see the way she took, I watched
her while she ascended that steep upward path. And
on she went, so wondrous, ﬂeet, and graceful, that, when
she gained yon cloudy summit, I thought within myself,
Had the voice’

“ Is this a shepherdess or an angel going back into the
sky?” Phantasmion hastened up the steep track to
which the servant of Malderyl pointed, and wound along
the mountain till he met an old man who was driving
on goats before him. He stopped when ‘the youth
approached his ﬂock. “Thou art a stranger by thy
garb,” said he; “dost thou know of the boiling fount,
and the volcanic ﬁres, which oft break forth on that
part of the mountain to which thou art proceding?
Daily I climb this hill ”—“ And didst thou lately see a
damsel here,” the youth inquired, “in the habit of a
shepherdess ? " “Yes, truly,” answered he ; “ and I meant
to give her warning, but she waved me oﬁ' with her
hand, and sped along so fast that even my goats
could scarce have followed her. She entered the stony
dell, which lies beyond the rocks, and there no doubt
she perished.” Phantasmion rushed away, passed the
rocks, and entered the dell where the fountain was
playing. He stood motionless at the entrance of the
hollow till the water subsided, then approached the
mound, and an icy chill seized his heart when he
beheld a leathern bottle petriﬁed on the edge of the
well, with a bucket and chain lying close beside it.
Believing that Iarine had been overtaken by the force
of the waters, and had so lost her life, he sought
about in desperation, expecting to ﬁnd her fair body
among the other petrifactions; but, seeing no trace of
any such thing, he imagined that she had fallen into the
well, and lying down on the edge of it, resolved there to
remain and await destruction. Many times he was
tempted to throw himself into the dark abyss, and, when
he called on the name of Iarine, he thought that ﬁerce

voices answered him. In this condition he remained till
the moon rose and threw her cold beams over the stony
dell ; when, turning his eye once again toward the
bucket, he descried the steel point of a petrified arrow
shining a little beyond it. Instantly it struck him that
this shaft had fallen from the quiver of some huntsman,
perhaps Ulander himself, and that he might have borne
Iarine away, either alive or dead. Roused by this
thought he started up, hurried down the hill, and, about
daybreak, knocked at the g0atherd’s cottage. The host
of Albinian and Iarine came out with his ﬁnger on his
lips. “There is a dying man in my house,” quoth he,
“I may not ask thee to enter. Thy steed has been
taken care of. Thou wilt ﬁnd him in yonder shed
beside the marigolds.” The goatherd having re-entered,
Phantasmion found his good horse, which recognised him
with signs of pleasure, but, so greatly exhausted was he,
that, instead of mounting, he sank down by his side, and
slept with his feet among the marigolds, and his head on
the neck of the gentle beast. Ere he awoke at mid-day,
one of Ulander’s train came nigh and stopped .his horse
in admiration of the young monarch and his goodly
steed, whose quick eye seemed to say, “ Pass on,4I pray
thee, and disturb him not.” The huntsman’s cheek was
fresh and glowing, while that of the slumberer looked pale
amid the sunshine and the gleams of his golden bed.
“Art thou Ulander?” said Phantasmion, starting up.
“ I would I were,” the youth replied, witha smile : “ not
for his crown and palace, but for the sake of a most fair
damsel, worthy of both, by whose side he is kneeling.”
“ Wilt thou guide me to that palace ? ” cried the young
king of Palmland, his burning cheeks and scintillating

eyes turned full on the huntsman. “ It is my home,”
the youth answered, “ and I can show thee the shortest
road to it.” Phantasmion was quickly mounted, he and
his guide went at full speed, whenever the road permitted,
and, ere the light began to fade, he entered the abode of
Ulander.

CHAPTER XXXI.
PHANTASMION LEAVES THE SYLVAN PALACE AND ZELNETH
RECEIVES SUCCOUR FROM FEYDELEEN.
PHANTASMION demanded to see the chief of Nemorosa,
and was conducted to a spacious apartment, the couches
and seats of which were covered with brindled or spotted
skins, the walls with horns of deer and rock-goats fanci-
fully arranged. There, under a high canopy adorned
with branching antlers, lay the wounded Zelneth, her
limbs motionless, her eyes closed in death-like languor,
while the young chieftain was raising her from the couch
in his arms, and trying, by a thousand assiduities, to
elicit signs of life and looks of recognition. So a child,
grieved to see his rarest ﬂower, the milk-white fox-glove,
with its whole spire of bells, newly blown, extended on
the earth, sets himself to support the crushed stem which
his own heedless foot has beaten down. But all in vain ;
for, leaning on the prop, it hastens to decay, no longer_
able to imbibe the dews that fall around it, withered by
that sun which lately nourished its ﬁrm stalk and burst-
ing blossoms. Ulander saw not the young king of
Palmland till he had entered the apartment, and stood
midway between the door and the couch, gazing intently
on Zelneth. But, when he did at last perceive his
presence, the chieftain started, uttering an exclamation;
roused by which the damsel opened her eyes, and seeing p

Phantasmion, leaped wildly from the couch, with crimson-
ing cheek and eyes of delirious brightness; but, her
strength soon deserting her, she fell forward, looking
still more lifeless than when she lay on the couch
upreared in the arms of the sylvan chieftain. Ulander
looked on with sullen surprise, while Phantasmion carried
Zelneth to the couch, and laid her on the tiger skins
with which it was covered. “ Who art thou 'i ” he said ;
“ art thou the brother of this maiden?” “ I am bound
to her by no near ties,” replied Phantasmion, with
haste: “she came to greet me as one who had received
hospitality at her father’s house.” “Why then hast
thou come hither,” rejoined the chieftain, “ breaking in
upon my privacy without leave asked ? ” “ I came in
search of another,” replied the youth, in some confusion ;
“ I came to inquire for this fair damsel’s kinswoman, the
princess Iarine.” “Iarine 2” exclaimed Ulander ; “ she
it was that wounded this lovely maid. I found her
bleeding in the midst of the forest, and she accuses
Iarine» of the cruel deed. That name, and one other,
inarticulately murmured, are the only words she has
spoken since she entered here.” “Iarine accused of a
cruel deed!” ejaculated Phantasmion: “ here is more
witchery, more wickedness and deceit !”—The chieftain
held up his ﬁnger, then pointing to the maid, “Look
there!” he cried, in a low stifled voice; “vex not her
parting spirit by violent words.” Phantasmion held his
peace, and drawing nigh to look on Zelneth, he felt
assured that her soul had abandoned its fair tenement for
ever. The crisp and glossy tresses that ﬂowed to her
waist seemed yet instinct with life; in all their wonted
beauty they curled around the full white arm that lay so

' 244 P/zantasmzbn
dead and motionless by her side : but mournful was the
stillness of her long black eye-lashes, which seemed now
laid to rest forever on that smooth cheek whence every
life-like tint had vanished, as the warm light of morning
fades from a snow-clad hill, leaving it as coldly white as
pure and polished marble. Ulander wept aloud ; Phan-
tasmion mused in sorrowful silence. Till now he had
never looked on Zelneth as on a bright ﬂower, doomed
to wither, but had felt as if she were like the glittering
stars that shine unaltered, while a thousand roses bloom
and perish.
At last he recollected what befel him in the house of
Magnart. “ Perchance the damsel is but entranced,”
he said; “I myself once lay thus for many an hour.”
Ulander raised his head, and, starting from his knees,
approached Phantasmion. “ Didst thou lie motionless? ”
he cried; “was thy breath suspended, were thy cheeks
as pale as these '£ ” Phantasmion poured balm into the
heart of Ulander by the answers he gave to all his eager
questions, and soon the chieftain called to mind how his
ancient kinswoman, Malderyl, had cured one of his train
who lay insensible after a wound received from' a wild
boar. The two youths were now standing together by
the couch, the hand of Phantasmion locked in that of
Ulander, who frankly told all he knew of Iarine, how he
loved and lost her, and how he was on the way to con-
sult Malderyl in the cavern concerning the fair princess,
when his thoughts were suddenly absorbed by the dis-
tress and beauty of Zelneth. “ But now,” says he, “I
will go forthwith to fetch the Queen of Tigridia: she
hath great skill in medicine, and in other arts too. Me
she loves well, and at my entreaty she will restore this

maid, and perchance discover to thee the retreat of
Iarine.” Right glad was Phantasmion to accept Ulander’s
intercession with one whose evil powers were not to be
averted by sword and spear; he zealously offered to keep
watch by the body of Zelneth and to defend it, with the
danger of his life, against a host of her kinsmen, should
they come to take it away. Having accepted his
courtesy, Ulander kissed the damsel’s cold hand as it
lay upon the couch, and sighed to see it no longer with-
drawn as heretofore; then with looks of deep anxiety he
hastened away. After his departure Phantasmion read
these lines which he found traced on a tablet, but whether
addressed to Zelneth or Iarine seemed uncertain :—
I thought by tears thy soul to move
Since smiles had proved in vain;
But I from thee no smiles of love,
Nor tears of pity gain :
Now, now I could not smile perforce
A sceptred queen to please :
Yet tears will take tb’ accustom’d course
Till time their fountain freeze.
My life is dedicate to thee,
My service wholly thine;
But what fair fruit can grace the tree
Till suns vouchsafe to shine?
Thou art my sun, thy looks are light,
O cast me not in shade!
Beam forth ere summer takes its ﬂight,
And all my honours fade.
When, torn by sudden gusty ﬂaw,
The fragile harp lies mute,
Its tenderest tones the wind can draw
From many another lute;

But when this beating heart lies still,
Each chord relax’d in death,
What other shall so deeply thrill,
So tremble at thy breath?
But the dark hours came on; no lamp shed light on
the silent face of Zelneth, when a train of damsels entered
from the garden, with lighted tapers, and baskets of
night-blowing ﬂowers in their hands. They sang a dirge
over the‘ maiden, then covered her body with those.
blossoms of greenish white or palest yellow, stuck their
tapers around the canopy, and slowly departed, leaving
the chamber ﬁlled with an aromatic fragrance. Phan-
tasmion had retired to the further end of the apartment,
where the horns of an elk threw their wide shadow on .
the marble ﬂoor, and from that station he watched the
mourners while they performed their gentle rites, then
softly stole away. At last the door was closed, but one
of the train yet lingered under the canopy, her ﬂower-
basket resting on the couch. Phantasmion, as he drew
forward, beheld her countenance by the light of the
tapers, which threw a tender gleam.over the pale ﬂowers,
the still features of Zelneth, and the bright aerial visage
that shone above them. “ Feydeleen !” cried the prince,
“ can Zelneth be restored? and O! where is Iarine?”
“ Leave Zelneth in my care,” she answered, “ and, seek ~
thou the domain of Melledine, there to ﬁnd and rescue
her that is lost for thy sake.” Phantasmion was about
to reply with eagerness, but the nightly exhalations of
so many overpowered his senses, and he sank on the
ﬂoor, motionless and pale as the fair damsel who lay
stretched upon the couch.
No sooner had he become thus entranced, than his

guardian spirit stood beside him. “ Feydeleen ! ” she
exclaimed, “ is it not enough to have deprived Phantas-
mion of the pitcher? wherefore hast thou dealt with
him thus?” The soft Fairy smiled on Potentilla, and,
with words and tones like the warm breeze that unbinds
the frozen earth, she persuaded her not only to forgive
what was past, but to make a compact with herself,
whereby all whom they both loved should in the end be
gainers. Potentilla called for her light car, drawn by
dragon-ﬂies, and having increased both to a convenient
size by magic power, conveyed away the fainting prince,
through the murky air, while Feydeleen remained alone
by the side of Zelneth.
As a plant that seems irrecoverably withered revives
at the ﬁrst shower, swells out its ﬂaccid leaves, and
stretches them forth to catch the kindly moisture, so was
Zelneth restored by the salutary dews and airs which
the kind spirit shed around her. Gradually a tender
bloom suffused her cheek, gentle breathing returned,
the damsel raised herself from the couch, holding out
her hand, as if to welcome some one, while her lids were
yet fast sealed, then fell back upon her pillow in deep
refreshing slumber. But, when a thousand ﬂowers
were opening their soft eyes upon the dawn, those of
Zelneth were unclosed, and up she sprang, scattering on
the ﬂoor the blossoms which had been so plentifully
strewed on her seeming corse ; they were now drooping,
while she was upraised in health and lifesome beauty.
Alas ! Phantasmion had disappeared, and all the apart-
ment was silent and solitary, till a fawn ran in from the
open door, through which, ere the cock crew, Potentilla
had carried him away. She went forth, and caught a

glimpse of Feydeleen, who was just entering a tufted
grove with a chalice in her hand. Zelneth followed,
and, kneeling on the ground, under the embowered
branches, besought her to declare why Phantasmion had
left her side, and whither he was gone. A slender
voice came from amid the myrtles, and it spoke thus:
“Phantasmion left Zelneth to seek Iarine.” “And
shall I never more regain his heart '4'" the maid ex-
claimed. Again the soft voice, breathing gales of per-
fume, gently but clearly answered in these words:
“Henceforth Phantasmion’s heart will never swerve
from Iarine." Zelneth continued to listen, while tears
chased one another down her upraised face, but the only
voice she now heard, was that of a turtle cooing to his
mate, with soft notes long dwelt upon, in the depth of
the wood. Then she strove to turn her heart against
the bright youth of Palmland, and grieved to ﬁnd how
much more love than pride had mastery there. While
her mind was full of such thoughts, she heard a slight
rustling ; something had fallen from the branches beside
the place where she sate, and, straight before her, she
espied the picture of Penselimer, with its eyes looking at
hers, and seeming to convey, in their passionate 1nelan-
choly, an expression of reproach. From the hour that
it fell from her lap, when she ﬁrst beheld Phantasmion,
Zelneth had scarce bestowed a thought on this idol of
her childhood, which Anthemmina, when her heart was
estranged from Penselimer, had carelessly hung around
her baby neck. Now she took it up by the chain of
pearls to which it was fastened, and sighed, as she gazed
on the well-known lineaments, for the free heart and
enamoured fancy of former times, when she rejected

many an unpleasing suitor, for the sake, as she loved
to imagine, of the noble Penselimer. Zelneth raised
her eyes, on being accosted in a shrill voice, and shud-
dered to behold Malderyl approaching her with a cup.
“ Ulander brought me to thy couch,” said the ancient
queen, “ where we found plenty of withered ﬂowers but no
entranced maiden; and soon my young kinsman, rushing
to the door, beheld thee bound lightly over the lawn.
I could have restored thee to health, had thy malady
continued, and, even now, I would have thee drink this
cup, lest it should return with the evening dews.” Zel-
neth suspected that the liquor presented to her was
some of that which had been prepared in the cavern,
and that Malderyl’s design was to make her return the
chieftain’s passion; nevertheless she took the cup and
slowly drank, with her eyes ﬁxed on the features of Pen-
selimer. Scarce had the magic draught pervaded her
frame than the portrait assumed a new aspect : it seemed
fairer, nobler than Phantasmion himself; love for the
king of Palmland seemed absorbed into a larger emotion,
as the last wave is swelled by those which have gone
before. Her visions of childhood rose again in all their
keen aerial colours; the realities she had since experienced
melted into indistinctness; their forms were gone, but
still their glow remained, and ﬁlled the atmosphere of
memory with warmth and golden light. Ulander ad-
vanced from amid the trees, where he had hitherto been
shrouded, and, seeing her face bright with smiles, when
she returned his salutation, he inwardly rejoiced, vowing
eternal gratitude to Malderyl, by whose endeavours he
fully believed that Zelneth looked upon him thus.
Formerly his enamoured looks and words, which the

maid lacked strength to repel, seemed to ‘hasten her
spirit’s ﬂight; now they fell upon her occupied mind
like rain-drops on marble, which glitters amid the
shower and remains unsoftened. Both were equally
possessed with gladsome fancies, and conﬁdent in the
success of their hopes, when they rode into the forest,
ere noon~day, followed by a train of huntsmen, Zelneth
indulging her steed in all his graceful vagaries, and
Ulander fondly hoping that for long years to come she
would thus disport herself by his side. “ Kings shall
sue for Zelneth, and for her the ardent lover shall forget
his ﬁrst love.” Feydeleen breathed this prophecy once
more in Zelneth’s ear, as she passed under the branches.
Now it was no longer unheard or unheeded ; the damsel
applied it to Penselimer, and joyfully expected that he
would soon appear to rescue her from durance.

CHAPTER XXXII.
PHANTASMION ENTERS THE SUNLESS VALLEY.
A NIGHT and a day had elapsed since Phantasmion left
the domain of Ulander,.when, roused from his trance, he
found himself descending through the sky. Then he
sate upright, and saw right before him, fanning the
twilight air, the gauzy wings of dragon-ﬂies, while
those of Potentilla, who stood upright on the seat of the
car, were playing above his head. The moon had not
yet risen, but, when he came to the ground, and leaped
upon the turf, he perceived a shining circlet in the sky,
and had no‘ sooner looked upon it, than it began to
descend, widening, swelling, and brightening as it sank.
The tract where Phantasmion stood ﬁrst glimmered, then
gleamed, and lastly shone with more than noon-day
splendour in many-coloured light, while gradually the
features of the scene stole upon his eye, and soon he
recognised the skeleton palace, ,where owls peeped forth
from bowers of ivy, the ruined hall with its watery ﬂoor
and rose-crowned window, and the wild pleasure ground
in all its ﬂush _of blossoms. The Deserted Palace, and
the space in front of it, were encircled by a vast hoop
of cold ﬂame, produced by innumerable ﬁre ﬂies.
Phantasmion turned to Potentilla, who was leaning back
in the car, over which her wings reclined, and smiling
at his looks of wonder. “Wilt thou go with me,” she

said, “ to rescue a lost maiden from the sunless valley?”
“Instantly,” cried Phantasmion. “ Wherefore do we
tarry?" “Recruit thy strength,” replied the Fairy,
“ with what is provided in the car, then drink from
this vial which Feydeleen gave _me for thy use. It will
ward off the drowsy inﬂuences of Melledine’s abode.
Phantasmion obeyed, and, while his eyes were brightening
with the effect of the Flower Fairy’s gift, Potentilla,
from the seat of the car, touched his head and shoulders
with her wand, then waved him after her as she soared
aloft. The next moment he was ﬂying through the air,
his head surrounded with a halo of intense light, his
dragon-ﬂy wings and whole body beaming with a keen
lustre, which varied from chrysolite to vivid green,
passing off into the deepest azure, and thence into
amethystine purple. . Potentilla ﬂew on before, with the
wings and radiant head of a lantern-ﬂy, and the clouds
of luminous insects followed. As the whole mass went
undulating along, they looked like a ﬁery river, ﬂowing
athwart the sky, and so proceeded, till just as the
moon rose, they overpassed the wall of rock which
bounded Melledine’s domain. “ This region,’.’ said
Potentilla, _“ by the spells of the enchantress, who
dwells here, is perpetually hidden from the sun's light :
the whole valley is girt on every side by rugged moun-
tains, and, during the day, it is shrouded by an opaque
fog.” Phantasmion followed his guide above the black
vapours, to a point over the centre of the valley, while
the ﬁre—ﬂies, high over head, appeared once more like a
circular constellation. Thence he saw the pitchy cloud
splitting in the middle, and shrinking more and more,
on every side, till at last it was heaped in huge scrolls

on the mountain tops. While the moon and stars in
full splendour were thus revealed to waking eyes below,
Phantasmion beheld their beams reﬂected from the
enlightened vale, from lily ﬁelds and groves of gleaming
foliage, pastures whitened with straying ﬂocks, and one
wide sheet of water.
As he descended he heard no sound but that of the
owls, hooting to one another from yew trees and ivy-
mantled rocks, the sonorous notes of those at hand
receiving clear but slender responses from others at a
distance. Coming yet lower, he began to catch the
nightingale’s upper notes, and next the sound of ﬂowing
waters and the gurgling of brooks. Potentilla waved
her wand, and the luminous procession, which was now
following in the form of a serpent, quenched its radiance,
and became suddenly as black as ink. Phantasmion
underwent the same change, and followed his guide,
who alone retained her light, to the abode of Melledine.
The enchantress was busily employed in gathering herbs,
on which the moonbeams rested, seeking them by the
side of a rivulet which wandered through a meadow,
silvered with white ﬂowers. A damsel delicately fair
and slender, with ﬂaxen locks that ﬂoated to her taper
waist, was following Melledine, and leading by a silver
chain a milk-white stag, the hoofs and horns of which
appeared to be also of silver. On his back the deer
carried a pannier, ﬁlled with ﬂowers and herbs, which
the damsel received from the enchantress, and deposited
there. Thus they proceeded, moving contrary to the
course of the brook, till they arrived at a rocky knoll,
where the same rivulet formed a little cataract, splitting,
like a ravelled skein, into divers shining threads, here

gliding in clear lapse over a smooth-faced stone, there
skipping from rock to rock enveloped with foam, here
narrow as a spindle, there spreading like a garment
puffed out by the wind. Melledine was stopping over
the united streams, when Potentilla ranged her legions
right above the meadow and watery knoll: the head of
the enchantress was crowned with white poppies and a
shining veil, ‘thrown back from her face, covered her
kneeling form. Surprised at the shade which darkened
the rivulet and its ﬂowery banks, she looked straight up
to the sky, disclosing a face of goodly features but black
as ebony. Gazing thus she beheld Phantasmion all
irradiated with purple light descending under the cloud,
and in an instant afterwards the pitchy mass became a
ﬂaming pavilion. Then, blinded and amazed, she fell
upon the ground, covering her face with her veil, and
muttering disjointed spells, without power to repeat any
at full length. Phantasmion alighted on the hillock, and
Potentilla, hovering over his head, called on Melledine to
deliver up the damsel whom she kept a captive in her
sunless domain. She, meantime, was hasting away with
the white stag, and soon entered a cypress grove, through-
which the rivulet held its‘ way. Melledine hesitated to
promise obedience, but when the air blackened with
swarms of stinging insects, and the ground with locusts,
she consented to yield up the captive maid, and to con-
duct her to the Deserted Palace through the pass
whereby she entered the valley. N o sooner was this
promise given than the locusts rose into the air : Poten-
tilla secured Melledine by chains, which were hidden
under her glittering raiment, and with which she was
wont to bind her victims: this being done, the whole

swarm ﬂew away along with the other insects, till they
disappeared in the distance. Phantasmion had no
sooner witnessed the submission of Melledine, than he
pursued the damsel into the dark wood. As he rushed
along, casting phosphoric splendour on the sombre
foliage around, the nightingales hushed their songs, and
the owls shrank away, letting down the curtains of their
prominent eyes. At last he obtained sight of the
damsel ; she, after ﬂitting on before him for some time,
being now unable to go any further, stood in the path-
way, leaning on the white stag, who had suited his pace
to that of the lady, and restrained his steps when he
saw that her powers of ﬂight were exhausted.
The damsel clung to her mild companion, hiding her
face against his neck, till the pursuer, having arrived
where she stood, took her hand and gently cried, “ Look
up, my fair one! it is Phantasmion.” At these words
he withdrew the dazzling radiance which streamed from
his whole person, leaving his head only encircled with a
diadem of softened rays. Then the lady raised her
face, and Phantasmion saw that it was Leucoia, the
sister of Zelneth. Ill-fated maid; she had drunk the
oblivious draught of Melledine, had not only forgotten
her parents and pleasant home, but ceased to pine for
the noble stranger, whose image had occupied her soul,
a beautiful poison tree, that spread abroad its glistering
boughs and blighted every other growth. But now
Phantasmion’s illumined face, radiant with love and
beauty, suddenly cast a ﬂood of light on forms and hues
of memory, which magic power had obscured, but never
obliterated; again she loves, again her stilled bosom is
roused to emotion, and, full of tears and blushes, she

once more hides her face on the stag’s neck. Phantas-
mion himself was overwhelmed with trouble and per-
plexity; Leucoia’s heart he had never cared to fathom,
but he now suspected that she, and not Iarine, was the
lost maiden whom he had been sent to deliver. “ Hast
thou not found the daughter of Albinian ?” he cried,
turning to Potentilla, as she came through the grove,
leading the sullen Melledine by her chain. “ O tell me
whither to go in search of her!” “Seek not here for
the lovely princess,” she replied: “ but free Leucoia
from captivity, and Feydeleen will lend her aid to make
Iarine thine.” “What power has Feydeleen?” cried
Phantasmion, “and why must I do her behest?”
“ Hast thou forgotten the silver pitcher?” Potentilla
replied; “without Feydeleen’s good will thou canst
never obtain the hand of her whom thou lovest.”
“Doubtless Ulander will be sent to rescue my lost
maiden?" exclaimed the youth. “Nay,” replied the
fairy, “Ulander cares for no one now but dark-eyed
Zelneth.” Leucoia had been weeping silently, while
the stag looked in her face with eyes full of tenderness ;
Phantasmion even fancied he saw a tear glistenthere,
and that he had seen that countenance before, if these
were not illusions of his dazzled sight. But at Zelneth’s
name the maid looked up with an enquiring glance.
“ Knowest thou aught of my sister T’ she said. “ Zel-
neth went to seek for thee in the forest of Nemorosa,”
the youth replied: “ there she was wounded by an
arrow, and now lies, I fear, in evil plight at the house
of the young chief Ulander.” When Leucoia heard this
her heart was oppressed by a crowd of sad emotions,
and, throwing herself on her knees before Phantasmion,

“ Take me hence, I beseech thee,” she cried; “I will
not keep thee long upon the road, but travel, night and
day, to reach my home.” Phantasmion declared that
he was ready to conduct the damsel whither she desired
to go. He raised her from the earth, and placed her
upon the back of the stag: Melledine showed the way
to the borders of a lake, and Phantasmion followed,
leading Leucoia’s gentle steed by the silver chain.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
PHANTASMION RESCUES LEUCOIA mom oarrrvrrr.
HAVING reached the banks of the wide sheet of water
which Phantasmion had seen from on high, the company
entered a mother-of-pearl boat, which was drawn by a
team of swans, a full grown pair in front of the vessel,

smaller than that behind, while a single tiny cygnet
ﬂoated on before. Doves fastened to the stern by silken
cords and studs of diamond ﬂuttered round the gleaming
skiff, and hastened its progress, while they lulled the
air with their downy pinions. The ﬁre-ﬂy constellation
was reﬂected, together with the moon, on the calm
waters, forming now a belt across her disk, now a ring
which inclosed and shone beyond it: white peacocks
spread their snowy trains over the dark foliage that
overhung the lake, white cormorants occupied the rocks,
and alabaster images of herons cast their still reﬂections
on the pool. A tiger emerging from the recesses of the
wood came to drink the cool wave, after sleeping in his
lair during the close heat of the darksome day; and he
too was colourless and gleaming as a ghost. Anon a
white bird of paradise rose from the trees, and ﬂew with
slow undulating motion over the lake, ﬁrst crossing the
moon’s bright image, then sinking amid blossoms, downy
and drooping as her own light plumage, like a snow-

ﬂake descended into a wreath of snow. The tiger was
drinking at the end of a little promontory as the skiff
passed by: a reﬂection on the water made him look up,
when beholding the youth's illumined visage, he sud-
denly rushed back again into the depths of the grove.
The company in the vessel were all silent and thought-
ful, Leucoia’s fair stag lay beside her feet, Potentilla
sate at the helm with Melledine’s chain in her hand,
while the captive crouched beneath, her ebon face bowed
forward. Phantasmion leaning over the prow cast such
bright gleams upon the waters, that the silver-scaled
ﬁshes leaped up, attracted by a stronger light than had
ever penetrated their liquid haunts before. The pen-
sive eyes of Leucoia were bent upon the youth's averted
face: she longed not for green ﬁelds and sunshine, but
would fain have dwelt with him in that gleaming vale
for ever. Melledine drew nigh the stag, and would
have rested her head upon his lily side, but when he
shrank away she leaned against the edge of the boat,
and began to murmur a soft melody. The tone of her‘
voice was inexpressibly sweet, and such was her power
that it seemed to proceed from the woods and waters
and all places except the skiff. For at the time her
words were inaudible, but, at last, Phantasmion, ceased
to watch the leaping ﬁshes, and listened unconsciously
to these 'numbers :—
Blest is the tarn which towering cliffs o’ershade,
Which, cradled deep within the mountain’s breast
Nor voices loud, nor dashing oars invade:
Yet e’en the tarn enjoys no perfect rest,
For oft the angry skies her peace molest,
With them she frowns, gives back the 1ightning’s glare,
Then rages wildly in the troubled air.

This calmer lake, which potent spells protect,
Lies dimly slumber-ing through the ﬁres of day,
And when yon skies, with chaste resplendence decked,
Shine forth in all their stateliest array,
O then she wakes to glitter bright as they,
And view the face of heaven’s benignant queen
Still looking down on hers with smile serene !
What cruel cares the maiden’s heart assail,
Who loves, but fears no deep-felt love to gain,
Or, having gain’d it, fears that love will fail!
My power can soothe to rest her wakeful pain,
Till none but calm delicious dreams remain,
And, while sweet tears her easy pillow steep,
She yields that dream of bliss to ever welcome sleep.
While the strain proceeded, a pleasing stupor stole
over Phantasmion, in spite of the antidote supplied by
Feydeleen; he began to dream with his eyes open, and
beheld the face of Iarine in that of Leucoia. He fancied
himself on the Black Lake, and the radiance of the moon
seemed to his eyes the same soft sunlight which had
shone upon his last interview with the island princess.
Potentilla had been busily plying her pinions, and broke
the silence of night with a continuous hum, which
seemed to tell of open ﬂowers and glancing sunbeams:
now her wings of gauze hung sleepily down, her lamp
languished, one hand dropped the helm, the other
resigned the chain, and bending forward, she nodded
over the stern. Then Melledine raised her head, and,
ﬁxing her eyes upon Phantasmion’s face, continued her
melodious incantations, accompanied by the soft noise of
downy wings and of the gliding vessel. Meanwhile, as
she waved her hand, a mist gradually rose all round the
skiff, and on its silvery tissue the rays of the moon
painted a vivid rainbow, which rested on either side

rescues Leueoia. 2 6 I
among darksome groves and shady waters, while, betwixt
the arch, an island, and the grey towers of an ancient
castle, appeared to loom through the vapoury veil. Then
Phantasmion dreamed that all which had passed, since
he plighted his faith to Iarine under the sunny rainbow,
was but a dream: he took from his bosom her glossy
ringlet, which had been twined with rubies to form a
crown for his brow, and placing it on Leucoia’s head,
while he whispered vows of changeless love, he bade her
wear it for his sake till she was queen of Palmland.
Melledine looked earnestly at Leucoia, with her ﬁnger
on her lips, and entreated her, in low breathed strains
of melody, to bear at least a silent part in this decep-
‘ tion. And, if the maiden loved Phantasmion while his
countenance was unimpassioned, how still more loveable
did he now appear, when his looks and tones expressed
the deepest tenderness ! But her spirit was free from
magic inﬂuence, and, having just recovered from the
treacherous spell, she was less subject to its power.
“ Never," she said, “shall Phantasmion, for my un-
worthy sake, be hidden from the sun's light; false
Melledine’s subtle sleights shall all prove vain." The
enchantress had by this time turned the skiff, the doves
fanned the air with redoubled vigour, and the swans
rowed swiftly on toward the head of the lake. Leucoia
took a loosened peg, which had fastened one of the dove-
cords into the skiff, and was about to prick the relaxed
palm of Potentilla, which lay half open beside her lap;
when the vigilant fairy, who had only been feigning
slumber, quickly rose, her ﬂames all rekindled, and
snatching the peg from Leucoia, plunged it up to the
diamond head in the arm of Melledine which was guiding

the rudder. Stung with _pain, the enchantress uttered
one loud piercing shriek : such a sound had never
escaped her lips till then, such a sound had never before
been heard in the gleaming valley. The peacocks which
sate in multitudes on the trees around the lake, unfurling
their eyeless trains to the moonbeams, echoed that
scream till the mountains rang again, and instantly after-
wards the ﬁery constellation descended from on high to
hang over Melledine’s head in the guise of a comet, that
ﬂamed and quivered just aloft with painful splendour.
Dazzled and stunned, she sank to the bottom of the skiff,
veiling her head and pressing her‘ palms closely over her
muﬂled ears. While Potentilla resumed the rudder and
put the vessel back into its former course, Phantasmion,
now thoroughly awakened, looked in confusion at the _
chaplet of Iarine’s hair which twined the ﬂaxen locks of
Leucoia. The damsel took it from her head, and with a
gentle smile and glistening eye, restored it to him :
that done, the stag, which had been standing by her
side with wild looks ever since Melledine turned the
skiff, lay down at her feet and rested peacefully as before.
After awhile the boat entered a river, by which the
waters of the lake partly ﬂowed off. The swans held
on their course till they arrived at a steep wall of cliff,
against the lower part of which a cloud was resting.
Here they stopped, and Potentilla having pulled Melle-
dine by the chain, she rose, and, waving her hand,
caused the cloud to soar. from the base to the middle of
the rock, discovering an archway, through which the
stream ﬂowed and disappeared amid the windings of the
passage. Leucoia embraced her gentle stag as they
entered the gloomy vault ; Phantasmion covered himself

with redoubled brightness, and cast his many-coloured
radiance on the expanded wings and arched necks of
the swans, while on before and around the gliding boat
all was black shadow, save where the ﬁre-ﬂies made a
golden line in the dark wave, or, soaring up, illumined
the roof of the vault, enkindling many a sparry rock,
which never reﬂected one bright ray before. At last
the damsel’s now unwonted eyes were smitten by a faint
sunbeam; the birds moved with renewed vigour, hasten-
ing toward the genial light, and soon a picture, delicate
and minute from distance, presented itself to the eyes of
the voyagers, who once more beheld the varied green of
trees opposed to the deep blue of the sky, and all the
landscape bathed in golden radiance. Melledine seemed
blasted by the sight, and crouched with her face to the
stern, closely wrapped in her veil. Meantime the halo
which surrounded Phantasmion faded away, and his
wings disappeared : but heedless of the change he sate,
gazing into the stream, while the swans lowered their
expanded sails, and Leucoia leaped ashore with her
white stag ; for once more he beheld his watery image
with that of a damsel holding up a pitcher before her
face. And now for the ﬁrst time he observed, in the
faint background of the picture, a prostrate form, with ‘
the aspect of one dying or dead. “Why renew this
vision?” said he to the enchantress, pulling her chain ;
“whom wouldst thou now delude '4’ ” The prisoner
replied that what had deceived Anthemmina was no
work of hers, but produced by a spirit of the waters,
who had the faculty of fore-showing future scenes.
While she yet spoke it faded away; all quitted _the
skiff, and, at a signal from Melledine, the swans dis-
appeared under the darksome vault.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
PHANTASMION nuns THE SECOND PART or
PENSELIMER'S STORY.
POTENTILLA bade Phantasmion follow the stream that
ﬂowed from Melledine’s domain till it entered a large
river. “There,” said she, “thou shalt ﬁnd one who
will convey thee and thy company to a dell not far
from Leucoia’s home. Offer the gem that clasps thy
sleeve to the boatman, and he will receive you all with-
out delay.” Then her form changed, and he knew not
if she were gone, or still ﬂitted around him among the
gilded ﬂies and feathery gnats that hummed in the sun-
shine.
As they proceeded, Phantasmion heard the rocks
resound from a distance, above the murmur of the brook,
the course of which they were following : sometimes he
thought they rang Anthemmina’s knell with melancholy
falls, and then again their merry tinkling chime seemed
ﬁtter to express the happiest espousals. Soon after
those sounds ceased to be audible, having arrived where
the waters met, and espied an old man in a boat, he
plucked the jewel from his sleeve, and ran toward him
holding it up to sparkle in the rays of the sun. On a
nearer view he saw that the conductor provided by his
guardian Fairy was no other than the ancient ﬁsherman
of the Black Lake, who clasped his hands for joy as

soon as he knew the prince. “ The messenger might
have told thy name,” he cried, “instead of offering
hire.” ‘ “What messenger?” inquired the youth. “ She
with bright wings,” he answered, “ who met me in the
watery dell, and bade me hasten hither with this boat.
Was it not on thy account she promised that I should
win by the journey more than my ﬁsh had ever earned
in Polyanthida? or was it all a dream ?” Phantasmion
replied that, if it were, he had dreamed to a good pur-‘
pose, and, having placed his companions in the vessel,
he took an oar, and seated himself beside the ﬁsherman,
who felt right glad to see him turn the boat, and begin
rowing down the stream. They made great way with
little effort, the full tide bearing them so rapidly for-
ward, that the rich meads of Almaterra ﬂew by like
dreams, while each new scene had carried its colours
into the next, ere the eye had time to distinguish it.
Now and then they came to land for refreshment, and
added the juicy fruits of the river side to their other
provisions: such delays Phantasmion yielded to courtesy,
though but ill pleased to see the stream run by his idle
boat. Nor did Leucoia wish to linger long upon the
way, for she had now resolved on following her sister to
the chieftain’s palace, if her mother’s consent could be
‘ gained; and the more her heart reproached her with
Zelneth’s wound, and Arzene’s anguish, the less she felt
the pangs of unrequited love.
It was now the end of the third day, and night hung
over the voyagers: white moths, ﬂitting by, reﬂected
feeble gleams of light at intervals, and once the eyes of
the wild cat glared amid branches that deepened the '
darkness of the waters by their shade. Leucoia slept

with a tear on her cheek, lulled by the chant of night-
ingales ; Melledine lay still, and heaved no breath ;
Phantasmion rowed on in silence, while the old man, »
from whose failing hand he had taken the oar slumbered
heavily at his feet. He was thinking whether Potentilla
still watched over him, when a ring of ﬁre-ﬂies suddenly
encircled the black visage of the: enchantress, and
In a few
moments they rose with shrouded light, and a well
known voice was heard to sing thus :—
What means that darkly-working brow,
Melledine ?
Whose heart-strings art thou wresting now,
Melledine ?
The dearest pleasure follows pain,
But thou with grief shalt aye remain,
And for thyself hast forged the chain,
Melledine !
“ Those gauzy wings !” muttered the ﬁsherman, dis-
turbed, but not awakened, by the fairy’s shrill pipe.
He slept in peace, while she thus proceeded in a softer
tone :— ‘
Ah, dreain of sullen skies no more,
Sad Leucoia !
The roughest ocean hath a shore, .
Sweet Leucoia!
A stedfast shore the billows kiss,
And oft some fancied joy to miss,
Prepares the heart for higher bliss,
Young Leucoia !
By daybreak the vessel was gliding near a ﬁeld, which

the river all but surrounded. Bright green was that
ﬁeld, sun-bright its liquid fence, and brightly shone its
groups of giant lilies, their glossy leaves full fed with
moisture, their painted petals vying with the painted
insect, which seemed in rivalry to rest its wings beside
them. Round this fair semi-isle Phantasmion steered
his boat, and saw that just beyond its farthest angle a
narrower stream, which ﬂowed beneath high woody
banks, joined company with the river, losing itself in
the stronger current as childhood steals imperceptibly
into vigorous youth. Guessing that this new comer
issued from the lake near Magnart’s mansion, he con-
cluded that here was the place to which the fairy had
directed him, and was preparing to land on the meadow
when his ear caught the melody of a harp, ﬂoating along
the hidden course of the tributary stream. The sounds
approached quickly from a distance, and now were inter-
preted by the varying tones of a voice, which it seemed
to him that he had formerly heard with the same accom-
paniment. He ﬁxed his eye on the spot where the rivers
met, and soon beheld a skiff, with silken streamer, glide
from among the trees. It made for the meadow, and,
when he had ascertained by whom it was occupied, he
took up the oars, and, having awakened the ﬁsherman,
began to look about for a landing place. Leucoia still
lay fast asleep, with her head towards the prow; she
had been dreaming of Zelneth, and seemed to roam in
search of her through tangled wilds; but, when the
sounds 'of the harp came thrilling across the waters,
they wrought new images into the dream. That kingly
portrait, once her sister’s idol, appeared to gleam upon
her lonesome path; but, when she stooped towards it,

the picture had become a living shape, while the frame
rose into high trees, between the golden shafts of which
the monarch sate before her, singing and playing on his
harp. This vision was dissolved by the slight shock of
the boat coming to shore, and no sooner were her eyes
opened than they discerned the very object of her dream,
Penselimer himself, with his hand upon the strings of the
harp, which he had just ceased to sound, while on he
came, betwixt the drooping trees that overhung the
river. And Zelneth stands beside him! Zelneth her-
self, with outstretched arms, and eager look, and face
not pale and languishing, but full of bloom and triumph,
as before the days of her unprosperous love. And who
is she that bends towards the long lost maid with deeper
and more melancholy fondness? Is it Arzene? Ah
yes ! that mild maternal brow is none but hers:
Leucoia is soon folded in her mother’s arms, and feels
that now indeed she has attained a peaceful haven.
When the happy tears and embraces of this meeting
were over, Arzene retired with her daughters to another
part of the dell, where a tent had been pitched among
the trees for their reception, and harnessed steeds were
in readiness to carry them home by land. Then Pense-
limer, ﬁnding himself alone with Phantasmion in the
island meadow (for the old man was a little way off
with his vessel), accosted him in the friendliest manner,
smiling, and saying with a perfectly rational air,—“I
owe thee many thanks, young king of Palmland; by
thy hand I have been restored to reason.” The youth
looked astonished at these words. “That thou art a
changed man,” he answered, “ I see plainly; but how I’
can have wrought the change I see not, and were thy

looks no less wild than thy speech, I should hold thee as
far from reason as ever.”_ “ Hear the second part of my
story,” said Penselimer, “ as thou hast formerly heard the
ﬁrst : I will soon show what part thou hast played in my
adventures, unknown to thyself.” Phantasmion delivered
Melledine to the attendants, and heard the king of Alma-
terra relate how the ebon-faced enchantress had tempted
him to seek the house of Malderyl, what had befallen
him there, how he personated his enemy, fought with
him in that disguise, and was wounded by the magic
weapon, but not mortally, as all supposed.” “And
whither went Glandreth? ” exclaimed Phantasmion,
Oloola/s prophecy rushing into his mind, “ did he invade
the land of Palms ? " “I thought not of him,” replied
the monarch; “ for days, indeed, I lay incapable of
thought, and, when my senses returned, was racked
with grievous pangs; but this bodily suﬁering proved
the cure of my better part, which, like the dyer’s
tincture, underwent the ﬁre till it became clear, glow-
ing, and resplendent. Reason rose, as it -were, from the
dead, and now in my true being I began to live once
more. Again the stars shone forth in their own bright-
ness, again the breezes blew with their own freshness,
self, shrinking within its natural limits, no longer
sicklied the whole face of outward things, as vapours
veil with one same lurid hue, earth, sky, and water;
my spirit ceased to multiply itself by a thousand vain
reﬂections, but grew and spread through nourishment
from without.
“While I was in this happy state, feeling as if my
soul were a thing apart from its mortal frame, yet with
my head sunken among the pillows from utter weakness,

Albinian’s queen drew near, weeping bitterly, and calling
me by the name of Glandreth ; while, at the same time,
methought there was a soft bright face on the other side
of the bed, which peeped from behind the curtains, and
seemed to be smiling at her in derision. Wondering if
these were but spectres of delirium, I raised myself up a
little, when Maudra, beholding my face, cried aloud, and
hurried from the apartment. Then that other bright
visitant, growing more distinct, showed herself to be the
fairy Feydeleen, and bade me hasten to Nemorosa,
where a lady of the house of Thalimer was detained
against her will. As she gave the command, the Flower
Spirit imparted the power of obeying it, such enlivening
odours and salutary dews she scattered round me ere she
disappeared. I arose, feeling that my wounds were
healed, and took my way, sane in body and mind, through
the country of Malderyl. Entering Nemorosa during
the heat of the day, I was allured to a shady covert by
the sound of falling waters, and there I spied a dark and
slender youth holding a silver vessel under a scanty rill
which spouted over the rocks. At the ﬁrst glance I
felt assured that this vessel was Anthemmina’s pitcher,
but, before I had resolved whether to claim it or no, the
dark youth mounted his horse and ‘rode away. ‘ Anthem-
mina is dead,’ thought I, ‘and if any malignant power
imagines that by this sight he may lure me back again
to my former dreams, he has missed his purpose; but,
for the sake of Anthemmina’s lovely child, I will see
into what hands the charm has fallen.’” Phantasmion
was now listening with a ﬁxed eye and troubled heart,
for he doubted not that Karadan was the youth with
the pitcher, and that he had gone in search of Iarine to

Nemorosa. “.1 followed- him,” pursued Penselimer,
“ but he had. ridden out of sight, and, while I was con-
sidering which way to take, a strange object arrested my
attention. Below the green oaks of the forest, grew the
stump of a black thorn, which seemed to have been
blighted, for not a single l_eaf remained upon its uncouth
boughs. The tree was split into a double trunk, one
portion of which reclined upon the ground, while the
other stood upright, and, toward the top, shot forth a
solitary pair of branches. Casting my eyes adown the
forest, I beheld the branches change into the horns of a
stag, the upright stem put on the appearance of a deer’s
head and towering neck, while that which lay upon the
ground swelled out into a body covered with a spotted
hide,' I rushed forward to examine this marvel, when
the creature started up on legs newly formed, perhaps
from the roots of the thorn bush, and ﬂew before me,
while I eagerly followed, spurring the sides of my ﬂeet
horse to overtake him. Bounding on with huge leaps,
he came at last upon a company of hunters, the most
noticeable of whom was one that wore a panther skin _
around his loins, and on his yellow hair a crown of
golden oak leaves. No sooner had this goodly youth
‘espied the giant stag, than off he ﬂew, followed by all
his train with whoop and hollo. One fair huntress
alone remained, gazing bashfully at me, with such looks
as might have made me pause on the road to paradise,”
“ And this fair huntress," cried Phantasmion, “was
Zelneth, daughter of Magnart; she whom Feydeleen
sent thee to deliver, she who was destined to replace all
that thou hadst lost in Anthemmina '€" “ Even so,”
rejoined Penselimer; “at ﬁrst I thought she was An-

themmina herself, restored in all her bloom and beauty.
And thus we stood silent and mot'ionless, till the shouts
of the distant huntsmen began to die upon the ear.
Then she ﬂed with me, and, on better knowledge of the
sweet lady’s features, I found they had an expression all
their own, and one for its own sake most worthy to be
loved. Fair indeed were the still eyes of Anthemmina,
gleaming amid cloudy tresses; seen in the light, they
showed as many exquisite shades of colour as a mountain
pool; but those of Zelneth sparkle so with life and
meaning, that we think less of them than of the eloquent
tales they tell. How her love was bestowed on me I
marvel; she was but a laughing babe-—”
“Think me no babe now!” cried Zelneth, softly
approaching, and smiling away some little confusion at
sight of the younger prince; “sooth to say, I have not
yet found thee much older and wiser than myself. I
should scarce quarrel with these few grey hairs,” she
added in a lower tone, “if they did not remind me of
the years that I have missed thy love." With a
brightened countenance Penselimer ﬁnished his story.
“ It was dusk,” he cried, “ when we entered Magnart’s
garden; Arzene ran from the threshold to welcome us,
but Zelneth greeted her with tears. ‘ Think not that I
bring Leucoia,’ she cried; ‘I hoped to ﬁnd her with
thee, but the tone of thy voice tells me that thou art
still bereaved.’ While the sad mother wept on Zel-
neth’s bosom, Feydeleen /gleamed upon my sight just
under those moon-shiny blossoms that droop over the
porch. ‘ Weep no more,’ she cried, in soothing accents,
‘but seek the long lost maiden in the watery dell.’ ”
“ Didst thou see her ?” asked Zelneth. “ As plainly as

I see thee now," replied the king, ﬁxing his pensive
eyes on the sprightly maid ; “and methought she drew
a white violet from her bosom.” “Ah, my sister’s
ﬂower!” the lady cried; “mine eyes must have been
dimmed with tears. I only heard her voice. And said
she not that a spirit of the wood protects Leucoia, and
that this same spirit lent her power to raise the sylvan
phantom that brought thee to my aid ?” “Methought
so,” the king replied; “ but, lady, let me place thee on
thy steed, or the sun will reach his journey's end while
we are delaying ours.” Then they all rose to depart,
and, after bidding farewell to the friendly ﬁsherman,
Phantasmion rode with Zelneth and Penselimer toward
the mansion of Magnart, relating his adventures in the
Sunless Valley by the way.

CHAPTER XXXV.
PHANTASMION MEETS A NUMEROUS COMPANY AT THE
MANSION or MAGNART. ’
MEANWHILE Arzene and her train were hastening home-
wards with fair Leucoia, whose snow-white stag tripped
on in front of the company, as if delighted to carry a
'rider that so beﬁtted his own graceful form. At times
the maid turned to exchange smiles with Arzene, and
see what watchful eyes were ever bent on her, then she
ﬂew forward again, surveying with new delight the vale
of Polyanthida, and every object brightened by the
beams of day. At last her father’s mansion came in
sight, and the damsel bounded on, waving aloft a white
mantle, and casting up her eyes to a_ little mount within
the walls, where her young brothers and sisters were
assembled to watch the advancing company. Thus she
approached the principal entrance, while the children
were skipping down the hill, and beheld, not far from
the gateway, an ancient woman seated in a car, to which '
leopards were harnessed. The heads of the beasts were
held by a youth, who had himself somewhat of a wild
and sylvan air, but not unmixed with gentleness and
lofty grace.' He was listening to the words of a dwarf,
who stood in front of the car, and grasped the reins
with his left hand, while with his right he pointed at
Leucoia. But when the damsel’s fair stag came nigh

P/zantasmzbn at t/ze /zouse Q/' Magnart. 27 5
the leopards, he started, and rushed through the open
gate by which the children had passed to meet Arzene.
The youth stepped forward, but could not overtake the
fugitive till he had reached the top of that woody hillock
which overlooked the road. There, holding the reins
of her sylvan steed, he told the lady that his name was
Ulander, that he had come to Polyanthida under the
guidance of his sage kinswoman Malderyl in search of
her lovely sister Zelneth, whom he sought in marriage,
and who had _ beencarried away from his forest realm
just when he hoped she would become his bride. “ Tell
me now,” cried he, looking out over the road with glow--
ing cheek, “is not that my betrothed lady who comes
in front of the troop '4” “A betrothed lady comes there,
but not thine, I think,” replied Leucoia, with a pitying
smile. “ O no, I cannot be deceived!” exclaimed the
lover; “ what damsel rides with such youthful spirit,
such queenly grace, as my fair Zelneth? O yes! and
surely that is Phantasmion of Palmland who comes on
before !” Ulander cast his sparkling eyes upon Leucoia’s
face, and marked its pensive air. “ But who is he that
keeps by the side of Zelneth?” the chieftain next
inquired. “ That is the king of this country,” she
answered. “And wherefore comes he to Polyanthida?”
asked the youth. “ To celebrate his nuptials, as I
guess,” Leucoia made reply. Ulander smiled when he
beheld her blushing cheek, and asked in a courteous
whisper if she were to be the bride. “ O no!” she
answered; “ Penselimer seeks the hand of Zelneth, who
had indeed betrothed herself to him, as I can witness,
before she went to seek for me in thy far country."
Struck by these unexpected tidings, Ulander dropped

2 76 P/zantasmion
the reins, and sank upon the ground; but soon recover-
ing, he saw the gentle eyes of the stag and of Leucoia
ﬁxed upon his face: the one was standing near him,
while the other kneeled by his side. The lady’s gentle
countenance tempted Ulander to pour forth all his sor-
row to her, and even while he spoke, her looks of pity
stole into his heart, and softened the bitterness of that
grief which he described so eloquently. But now Arzene
appeared, climbing the hill with young Hermillian and
all her blooming train. The chieftain was still telling
his tale with passionate gestures to Leucoia, who leaned
upon her stag, and felt her own griefs assuaged by the
tears that ﬂowed for Ulander. Arzene accosted the
youth, and made him the same courteous proffer of
hospitality which had been already accepted by his
ancient kinswoman. He gladly consented to be her
guest, and accompanied the wife and daughter of Mag-
nart to a pleasant bank shaded by trees, and spread
with wines, and fruits, and dainty viands, by Arzene’s
command. Ulander kept by the side of Leucoia, con-
tinuing his discourse as much for the sake of the listener
as the subject; for, while he beheld her gentle _smiles,
and soft retreating eyes, new thoughts and wishes began
to arise in his bosom. Insensibly he ceased to think of
Zelneth ; but, caressing Leucoia’s silver-coated stag,
observed how fair he would look among the glades of
Nemorosa. “Wilt thou go to that far land?” quoth
the damsel playfully to her favourite. “ Fair mistress,”
replied the chieftain, answering for him, “ without thee
I should pine and perish; let us both dwell there to-
gether.” At that moment the stag raised his soft bright
eye, and looked at Leucoia, as if he adopted what was
said in his name.

Arzene and the ancient queen were now sitting on a
bank ; the white deer came to browse beside them, ever
and anon looking up in the face of Malderyl, who scowled
and shuddered as she met his gentle gaze. Ulander
among the trees at a little distance was teaching Leucoia
how to shoot, when Zelneth, followed by her noble com-
panions, entered the grove. With light steps she
approached her sister; but, on a sudden, beheld the
chieftain of Nemorosa bending his bow under a laurel.
At that sight she uttered an exclamation of surprise,
and drew back hastily to the side of Penselimer. Then
she approached the bank to salute young Hermillian,
who was twining his mother’s hair with honeysuckle,
and started, when the face of Malderyl presented itself
to her view. .
Soon afterwards the whole company assembled in
Magnart’s princely hall, but, while the guests were gaily
entertained, their gentle hostess sighed for one that was
absent, and wondered whether Karadan had joined his
father in Rockland. Ulander had ceased to sigh, and
appeared so all intent upon winning Leucoia’s grace
that Zelneth addressed him with one of her archest
smiles, and inquired what had become of the panther’s
skin which he used to wear for her sake. She blushed
when the youth whispered that he did but follow her
example ; had not she too forgotten for whose sake she
once wore it? Afterwards, however, he drew a remnant
of the hide from beneath his vest to spread it under
Leucoia’s feet, then cast upon the spotty carpet his
crown of golden oak leaves, which Zelneth took up, and
twined among her sister’s ringlets.
Amid these and other such pleasantries the evening

shades stole on, when Melledine dismissed her gloom, and
joined insensibly in the general mirth. Next Malderyl
rose, and with meaning glances, besought the Lady of
the Sunless Vale for that oblivious charm which her
kinsman stood in need of ; at the same time she placed
a chalice in her hand, and Melledine, taking forth a
vial, poured the contents therein, and delivered the cup
to Ulander. But he ﬁxed his eyes on Leucoia, as she
sate considering the coronal which now she held in her
hand, and, declaring that he had no ﬂames in his bosom
which he desired to extinguish, poured out the liquor
on the marble ﬂoor. Then Malderyl complimented the
bashful maid on having gained a most experienced
suitor, one so well seasoned to love’s variable clime that
he might now endure its worst vicissitudes; and, ﬂing-
ing stones that rebounded from one point to another,
annoyed all present by hints at Ulander’s passion for
Zelneth, and his worship of Iarine. While the youth
himself maintained a blushing silence, Melledine pre-
tended to take his part. “Methinks I can spy good
reasons for his last change,” said she, “ I know of a song
which ﬁts this case well ”—“ A song ! ” cried Malderyl ;
“let us hear it; thy voice may have more persuasion than
thy words.” Phantasmion was absorbed in thought of
.Iarine, and Leucoia engaged by the silent courtship of
her sylvan lover, when this wily proposal was made ; so,
without opposition from them, the veiled lady held up
her fettered arms, where she stood in the midst of the
hall, and, with expressive gestures, began to sing thus
in the person of Ulander :
Methought I wander‘d dimly on,
But few faint stars above me shone,
When Love drew near,-

“ The night,” said he, “is dark and damp,
To guide thy steps receive this lamp
Of crystal clear.”
Love lent his torch,—with ready hand
The splendid lamp, by his command,
I strove to light ;
But strove in vain ; no ﬂame arose, '
Unchanged, unﬁred as moonlit snows,
It sparkled bright.
Again on wings as swift as thought
The boy a glittering cresset brought
Of sunny gold:
Full sure ’twas worth a monarch’s gaze,
And how I toil’d to make it blaze
Can scarce be told.
Depriv’d of hope I stood per-plex’d,
And, through my tears, what oﬁer’d next
Obscurely ﬂoated:
One other lamp Love bade me take,
Mine eyes its colour, size, or make,
But little noted;
Tillzsoon (what joys my soul inspire !)
From far within a steady ﬁre
Soft upward steals ;
And O how many a tender hue,
What lines to loveliest nature true,
That beam reveals!
Now what reckl of burnish’d gold,
Or crystal cast in statelier mould ?—
This lamp be mine,
Which makes my path where’er I go,
With warm reﬂected colours glow,
And light divine.

of the liquor which had been spilled upon the ﬂoor,

infected the hearers with drowsiness, and, as the song
proceeded, the scenes it pictured stole upon their misted
eyes: ﬁrst dim star-light, then Love with a torch and
lamp and beamy smile emerging from a wood, till at
last a crowd of Witching faces, and bright torches, and
lamps of a thousand shapes and colours, lit and unlit,
waved. , along before them in endless succession. Even
the enamoured chief could no longer look upon the very
face of Leucoia, but beheld a lucid image of it with
closed lids. The maid herself scarce inquired whether _
-
she were indeed the lamp that was kindling at Ulander’s
touch, and, though lately proof against Melledine’s
charm, now nodded under the inﬂuence of this doubly
potent spell. Phantasmion kept his eyes open longer
than the rest, and perceived that Malderyl was loosing
the fetters from his captive's feet and hands, but was
too fast held in drowsy bands to prevent her liberation,
and, ere it was fully effected, he too lay slumbering on
the ﬂoor. A new sun had just dawned when he
started up and saw its rays brightening the crimson
cushions around, and the fair faces which reclined on
them; but the enchantresses were gone. With smallhope
of recovering his prisoner he rushed into the garden,
and, passing toward the chief entrance through a shady
avenue, beheld the traces of panthers’ feet on the humid
soil. But 'beyond the trees and the gate, in open sun-
shine, not a foot-mark was to be seen upon the ﬁrm
dry earth; and, when he looked at the contracted
shadows of cattle on the verdurous plain, and saw the
broad blue sky, where a carolling bird was the only
speck of darkness, he felt as if drowsy charms, and sun-
less vales, and sable visages were but dreams of a long
dim night.

CHAPTER XXXVI.
ULANDEB cosnuors LEUCOIA 'ro THE FOREST.
THERE was something in the face of the huntsman chief
which brought to Leucoia’s mind young Dariel of Tigri-
dia. The maid had loved and suffered silently, so that,
when she listened to the suit of Ulander, Arzene thought
she gave her hand to him who had ﬁrst touched her
heart. The nuptials of Zelneth and Leucoia were cele-
brated in their native vale, and Sanio, Penselimer’s
trusty minister, being present at the festivities, was the
ﬁrst to inform the king of Palmland that Glandreth had
invaded his dominions, and was now occupying them
with a powerful army. Forthwith a league was struck
betwixt the three sovereigns, who resolved to unite hand
and heart against the common enemy, to drive the in-
vaders from Palmland, to free Almaterra from depend-
ence on the Land of Rocks, to protect the right of Albi-
nian’s son, and to place Ulander on the throne of his
ancestors. Phantasmion resolved on secretly entering
Gemmaura, that district which had been annexed to
Palmland by the union of Zalia and Dorimant, for the
sake of raising the spirits of the inhabitants by his
presence and stirring them against the foe. It was
settled that Penselimer, meantime, should divide his
forces, that one part, in company with the foresters of
N emorosa, should fall upon Rockland, while the other,

282 Phantasmion.
having joined Phantasmion in Gemmaura, which was
yet free from the foreign troops, should unite with such
an army as he could muster to drive the invaders from
the Land of Palms. With these allies Phantasmion
would have felt sure to triumph but for the lack of metal
armour, which damped his subjects’ martial prowess.
Neither could the king of Almaterra supply the deﬁ-
ciency, for all the steel and brass which his people had
in use they derived from Rockland, having neither mines
nor skilful smiths among themselves. Magnart could
not be called upon to fulﬁl his big promises, for he had
entered Rockland with all the men he had at command,
under pretence of securing Albinian’s throne, against his
brotherls selﬁsh schemes, for the boy Albinet. He de-
sired to have his eldest son with him in this expedition,
and to bring about his marriage with Iarine; but the
youth’ and the maid were both missing, and no one could
inform him where to seek for either, Penselimer’s queen
was eager to raise a powerful army in behalf of Phantas-
mion, not from any lingering remnant of love for him,
but that her kingly spouse might appear important in
the eyes of all men: Leucoia dreaded warfare, but from
gratitude to her deliverer she felt anxious that he should
be enabled to regain hisikingdom.
While Phantasmion journeyed on towards his mother's
country, which lay betwixt Almaterra and Palmland, full
of grief to think that he must again travel away from
Iarine, Penselimer conducted Zelneth to his castle with
regal pomp, and Ulander’s gentle bride accompanied her
spouse to Nemorosa. The wife of Magnart went with
Leucoia on her journey; for having heard Penselimer’s
tale, she could not doubt that the youth who carried a

silver pitcher was her beloved son, and purposed to make
inquiry in every house on the borders of the forest till
she traced him out. After many disappointments in
this quest she entered the goatherd’ s cottage, and there
heard tidings which made her resolve to shape her course
toward the sea. Arzene had left home with no attend-
ants of her own, and now that she was to part company
with her son and daughter, Leucoia bade the chieftain
guard her through the dangerous forest. Ulander,
though somewhat loth, obeyed his bride’s behest, and, to
show his zeal and devotion, attended her mother, leaving
Leucoia at the goatherd’s cottage. The lady asked many
questions of her host concerning his late guests. She had
already heard him relate to Arzene how a beautiful young
maid and her aged sire abode under his roof, how the
old man died, and the damsel departed with a tall dark
youth who bore a silver pitcher. Now he spoke more
minutely of these matters, and showed the jewels which
his guests had given him. Leucoia felt certain that the
decrepit man of whom he spake must have been Iarine’s
father, and full of tender thoughts, she wandered forth
alone to view the hollow in the rocks where his body
had been deposited. Passing through a part of the wood
she espied the fair white stag browsing among the trees
. a little way off, and, fearing that he might stray too far,
she went to lead him back toward the cottage. On she
tripped, calling him by his name in silver tones; but,
ere she reached his side, two dwarfs rushed out upon
her from behind some bushes, and, while one pinioned
her arms, the other bound them with cords, then both
together placed her at the bottom of a car drawn by
' leopards, wherein the ancient queen of Tigridia was

seated. “ Swartho,” said Malderyl, to one of these
monsters, putting the reins into his hand, “dost thou
see how yon white deer stands terror-stricken? Drive
up to him: if he awaits our approach I will throw this
noose round his neck, and take him to the gardens of
the cavern.” Swartho’s toad eyes gleamed strangely
while his mistress spoke, and, as he stared in aﬁiight, the
scarlet ring ﬂamed out all round ; but, without answering
a word, he shook the reins and drove up to the stag.
Leucoia was lying stupiﬁed at Malderyl’s feet, the witch
stood erect, the object of attack appeared as motionless as
if it were a marble eﬁigy placed there to decorate the glade.
But no sooner had Malderyl cast her loop round his neck
than she dropped the cord and shrieked aloud : it was no
stag, but a tiger with glaring eyeballs and terriﬁc jaws,
around which her noose was hanging. With a roar
that shook the forest he sprang upon the leopards, and,
at that moment, Ulander appeared in sight. Perceiving
the jeopardy of his kinswoman he rushed on with his
javelin uplifted: but, no sooner had he approached the
car, than the tiger vanished. Ulander beheld his own
Leucoia lying bound at the feet of Malderyl, and the
hideous dwarf crouching like a nightmare on her breast.
In a moment he had severed the cords that bound her
arms, and would have spitted the monster with his
spear, but a voice that seemed to be made up of many
sweet voices, so powerful and mellow it sounded, was
heard to speak thus; "Take home thy gentle bride,
Ulander, and let the dwarf and Malderyl go unhurt.
Fear nothing for Leucoia: she may wander securely, by
day or night, amid the loneliest recesses of this forest.
The Spirit of the Woods protects her, and destined the
maid from childhood for thy bride. Go, Malderyl! in

vain wouldst thou seek to overthrow my plans: ﬂy to
thy mountain abode, and lurk no longer in the shadow
of these boughs, weaving deceits and treacheries.”
While the voice continued, every bird was silent, every
leaf motionless on the spray; but, when it ceased, a
murmur ran through the forest, as if the whole expanse
of foliage were swept by one strong transient gale, and
all the feathered inmates of the wood burst forth at
once into a choral melody. Leucoia leaped upon the
turf, then Malderyl drove her leopards through an
opposite quarter of the forest, and soon was hidden from
view amid leafy oaks and beeches. The lady by
Ulander’s side pursued a different course: wherever she
passed, the birds crowded to the boughs, even the trees
themselves appeared to be saluting her with lowered
branches, and a troop of white fawns, like snow-drops,
such as had never been seen in that region before,
skipped around and preceded her steps.
But when, the wedded pair arrived at the Sylvan
Palace, Ulander saw, to his astonishment, that its
precincts were enlarged, that a fence of tall trees which
formerly bounded one end of it was now removed, and a
delicious pleasure ground, watered by a clear stream,
laid open to the view. This was Malderyl’s garden,
which the Spirit of the Wood had thus added to the
domain of Ulander, having taken off the spells which
had hitherto hedged it round. The Witch’s cavern was
yet standing, but soon afterwards an earthquake laid it
in ruins, and the place it had occupied became a rocky
channel, where the river, diverted from its ancient bed,
ﬂowed roughly, ﬂashing and raving in its broken course,
as if indignant at the remembrance of deeds once per-
petrated there.

CHAPTER XXXVII.
AFTER THE DEATH or ALBINIAN IARINE LEAVES
THE 'GOATHERD’S corrass.
WHILE the daughters of Magnart were surrounded with
festal pomp and pleasure, Iarine watched her father's
dying bed, and, so deeply was her heart engaged by his
wants, and sufferings, that the season of Albinian’s
mortal sickness, with its slightly varied stages, its
melancholy hopes and transient restorations, remained
imprinted on her mind like a vivid chart, which the eye
surveys at once all equally distinct and clear from the
beginning to the end.
Just before his death, Albinian spoke of Maudra and
Anthemmina; for in this time of natural decay his
speech was wholly restored. “It was a fearful retri-
bution,” he said, “ that she to whom I denied my hand
and heart, (alas too hastily promised,) should be enabled
to bewitch my spirit with an amorous infatuation, and
afterwards my body with unnatural weakness. But O,
the beauty of Anthemmina might have done away
stronger traces from the heart than Maudra ever left on
mine!” Iarine sighed, and still more sadly she felt
when Albinian spoke further. “ Weakly and wrongfully,”
he said, “ I accepted the fair hand which a father
offered me, and that gift brought after it a train of evils
which clung to the receiver even after the gift itself had

been taken away. Dorimant was in all her thoughts,
Dorimant was in her nightly dreams : when, wrapped in
slumber, she uttered the name of Dorimant, sleep
deserted my pillow; one fatal image haunted the
unloved husband and the regretful wife. But thou,
Iarine, wast the child of that marriage; thy beauty
brings only blessing and happiness ; thou hast loved me
here, and where I go thy love will follow me.” While
he spoke thus, the old man’s withered face began to
expand and brighten, his mind being ﬁlled with the one
only thought on which it could dwell with perfect
complacency. He imagined blissful regions, where
Maudra and Anthemmina could wreck his peace no
more, where Iarine, with brave Karadan, who from.
boyhood had shown him reverence, might dwell for ever
in his sight. But soon that vision faded, while sad
remembrances and anticipations cast their deep shadows
over his soul. Iarine saw that his countenance was
disturbed, though no new words had been spoken, as a
lake appears ruﬂied on the surface while not a breath of
air is stirring abroad, and the valesmen imagine a wind
under the waters. Albinian was thinking of Albinet,
left in Glandreth’s power, of his infant boy in the palace
of Palmland, and, worse than all, of Iarine plighted to
the son of Dorimant. “Father!” said the maid, reading
part of his thoughts, “ thy children have noble and
brave defenders: me they may survive as well as thee,
but while I tarry here below I will watch those children
with a mother’s care; and rich indeed will be my
reward when I receive thy thanks hereafter, and hear
thy sons declare that I faithfully discharged my trust !”
These soothing images found no entrance to the spirit

of Albinian; Dorimant and Anthemmina, Iarine and
Phantasmion, linked together in eternal bliss! Alas!
alas! earth had been a scene of sorrow to the dying
man, and heaven, he feared, would be no heaven for
him. He pressed the hand of his daughter, and,
even while the dews of death stood on his forehead, his
sunken eyes appeared to glow and be projected by the
force of passion. “Promise to marry Karadan, thy
dear mother’s kinsman,” he cried, with struggling utter-
ance ; “then I shall die in peace:” at that 'moment
the unhappy maiden longed to die too, and dwell with
both her parents in realms above. She remained
silent, while tears ﬂooded her cheeks, and her whole
frame trembled. With a faint groan Albinian abandoned
her gentle hand, and instantly afterwards he ceased to
breathe. Iarine .closed his eyes and knelt beside the
bed with her face bowed down in sorrow.
She had remained for some time in this posture lost
to all outward sights and sounds, when a well known
voice roused her from abstraction. Iarine lifted up her
eyes, dim with tears, and beheld the silver pitcher of
Anthemmina gleaming in the light admitted by a narrow
casement at one end of the rustic chamber. He who
held it now advanced from the door, and she saw the
dark face and slim ﬁgure of Karadan. “Is he dead?”
cried the youth, gazing sorrowfully on the couch: “ O,
say not that he is gone for ever ! I have here a blessed
medicine, which the kind spirit has given me at my
earnest prayer : I myself have felt its wondrous potency."
“ It comes too late!” replied the maid, with fresh-ﬂow-
ing tears: “charms and witcheries can have no power
upon him now, for good or evil.” “Woe is me !”

exclaimed the youth, “it would have restored him to
health and vigour! How long have I been wandering
bewildered in this land of trees ! O would that
Feydeleen had shown me thy abode before !" “ Many
thanks to thee, Karadan !” exclaimed the damsel fervently;
“ thou hast ever loved and honoured my father ! "
Karadan wept, and stood looking with a countenance of
grief on the face of Albinian ; at last he said, in a low
voice, “ Thy father loved me too, and fain would have
had me for a son. Were thou and I united in marriage,
his spirit would be ever nigh to bless and to protect us."
“ O, Karadan ! " replied Iarine, “ with his dying voice_he
urged that suit; yet even now, could I restore him to
life by granting it, the little word might not be spoken.”
Karadan remained silent for some time after Iarine had
uttered these words, kneeling by the side of the bed;
then he clasped his hands, and looking up, with a face of
‘deep anguish, “ Yes, yes !" he exclaimed; “it was fated
long ago ! I see that thou art never to be mine !
Thou couldst not consent, even to bring back Anthem-
mina from exile ! ” Iarine gazed on Karadan, as if to
read his meaning in his eyes, but soon the youth declared
that meaning with solemn words and oaths. “ Anthem-
mina yet lives ! ” he cried; “ blame me not that I have
concealed this truth till now : hereafter thou shalt know
that I am blameless. Anthemmina did not sink beneath
the waves, and I can guide thee to the coast, where
Feydeleen last night shed balm upon her lonely pillow."
Iarine stood rapt, with face upturned and arms out-
stretched, but motionless; her heart and brain seemed
overborne by a multitude of thoughts and feelings which
crowded on them at once ; a thousand dreams were

suddenly realised, and started up from the depths of
memory into brilliant light. At last she clasped her
hands and rushing to her father's side, “ O wake again,”
she wildly cried, “ to hear that my mother lives ! ” The
eyes of him who lay on the couch were open, and he
returned her eager gaze. Albinian was not dead : sense
and breathing had feebly returned, and he had heard
that she whom he had never ceased to love, was yet
among the living. He beckoned to Karadan, who stood
with eyes ﬁxed on his in amazement. Karadan
approached and kneeled by his side. Albinian looked
at the maid, then at the youth, and pointed to the
silver pitcher now standing on the ﬂoor. His lips
moved, and Iarine knew, as she bent over her father, that
he was entreating her to be the wife of Karadan, and to
seek with him for Anthemmina. “ Give me thy hand,”
cried the youth rising: then he whispered in Iarine’s
_ear, “Satisfy the soul of Albinian, and thou shalt be
freed from this tie by the time that thou beholdest
Anthemmina.” The maid no longer held back, but
placed her hand in the hand of Karadan, and the youth,
ﬁrmly grasping it, said aloud, “ Thy daughter has
betrothed herself to me, and death only can separate _us.”
Iarine marked not the import of these words, her mind_
being wholly occupied with the change that came over
her father’s countenance immediately after they were
spoken; for his face, though it wore a happy smile. was
now again like the face of the dead. Karadan took the
pitcher, and bedewed his body with the charmed liquor
supplied by Feydeleen. The effect was marvellous:
every wrinkle was removed, soft bloom overspread the
cheek, and that body, so miserably wasted by sorrow and

sickness, shewed like the corse of some fair and youthful
person whose thread of life had been snapped by sudden
accident. But this adorning was only for the tomb;
Albinian’s spirit had ﬂed a moment after Iarine placed
her hand in that of Karadan ; the empty tenement
looked meet to be inhabited, but the soul returned to it
no more.
Long did Iarine linger over the corse of Albinian ; but,
when all hope was gone, having placed her father’s
remains in a cofﬁn, she went with Karadan to lay them
in a hollow among the rocks, where the goatherd
promised they should remain in safety till they could be
removed to a more august receptacle. That service per-
formed, Iarine besought Karadan to fulﬁl his promise of
conducting her to the abode of Anthemmina, and having
mounted a mule, she bade her sorrowful host farewell
with many tears, declaring that even when he should
cease to be the guardian of her father’s body every link
would not be severed which bound her to him.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
PHANTASMION VAINLY ATTEMPTS THE DESTRUCTION OF
GLANDRETH, BUT, ENTERING THE BOWELS OF THE
EARTH, HE MEETS WITH ONE WHO ASSURES HIM OF
VICTORY AND VENGEANCE.
PHANTASMION had hardly set foot in Gemmaura when
his guardian spirit appeared before him. “ Beware,"
she cried, how thou proceedest in this district: “the foe
has been here before thee. Hast thou no remembrance
of the country around?” Phantasmion replied that it
scarcely seemed new to his eyes. “ Not far from hence,”
rejoined Potentilla, “is the mansion where thy mother
used to dwell with Cyradis, her guardian. After
marriage Zalia loved to revisit the spot, and see her
little son gambol in those green haunts where she her-
self had sported when a child ; and here in her death-
sickness she desired to be buried, feeling like one who
longs to lie down in the old accustomed chamber. Her
ancient friend survived till an hour ago, but Glandreth
and his savage band have murdered him.” Then Phan-
tasmion cried aloud, and, ﬂinging himself upon the
ground, began to tear his bossy ringlets. “It was
rumoured,” said the Fairy, “ that he possessed a treasure,
and was acquainted with rich mines. And so they
pierced him with spears, on the tomb of his beloved
pupil, which he daily visited; then digging‘ into the

ground, discovered no precious stones or metals, but thy
mother’s coﬂin, which they are even now carrying away
into Palmland. For Glandreth declares that he will
hold a solemn feast and burn the relics of Dorimant and
Zalia, before all the people, as a sign that the old race
of the Palmland kings is utterly abolished.” Phantas-
mion now sprang from the earth, and, grasping Potentilla’s
robe, implored her either to end his life at once, or to
give him the means of sudden vengeance. The Fairy
made answer that she could devise but one way of
helping him to that for which his soul thirsted, and this
was a plan fraught with toil, hazard, and even abase-
ment.” Phantasmion exclaimed that he would do and
be and suffer anything, if he might but stop his enemies
in their outrageous career. “ Then listen,” she replied;
“ among the innumerable subjects of my insect realm is
one which digs a pitfall in the sand. For nature has
so constructed its unwieldly form that it walks back-
ward, and has no other means of catching the nimble
creatures which it preys upon. At the farther end of
Gemmaura is a wide sandy plain: this thy enemies
have to traverse ere they reach the luxuriant Valley of
Palms, where their armed comrades are to meet them,
and the festival is to be celebrated on the morrow,
Thither thou shalt go, and, in the guise of that crafty
insect, prepare a gulf large enough to swallow up Glan-
dreth and all his murderous band when they arrive
there.” The youth embraced this offer, and, having‘
received wings from Potentilla, rapidly followed her
through the air, and alighted on a spot suitable for the
undertaking, just before the entrance to the Vale of
Palms. At a touch of the F airy’s wand his wings

vanished, and, in the same point of time, every vestige
of his human form disappeared. Led by a natural
instinct he forthwith set to work, and traced out circle
within circle in the sand, his new body and limbs being
his only instruments. Labouring without stop he at
length scooped out a deep cavity, of size proportioned to
the gigantic form that wrought it : at the bottom of the
‘snare the metamorphosed prince now took his seat,
covering himself with sand, so that the upper part of
his head with the points of his horrid fangs, which were
like two reaping hooks crossed, alone remained visible;
and, over the hollow, Potentilla wove a gummy web, ‘on
which, when ﬁnished, she strewed a light covering of
dust and common soil.
By this time the sun was sinking in the west, and .
the last clump of spiral trees, which G]andreth’s company
passed on the margin of the desert, cast their lengthened
shadows on the yellow sand. The leader had fallen
back to the rear, and was deep in discourse with a
chieftain, richly apparelled, to whom he was vaunting
his triumphs, and describing how he meant to rule the
state of Palmland. Some way in advance were. those
that bore the remains of Zalia, and the younger men
went riding on before. No sooner had these youthful
warriors, who were mounted on prancing steeds, arrived
at the sandy plain, than for their own sport and that of
their horses, they resolved on running a race. Their
friends behind warned them to beware of the old quarries
which lay on the right: but, conﬁdent and careless, off
they started, avoiding those excavations only to fall into
an equally‘destructive gulf. Within a few seconds of
each other all arrived at the abyss which gaped to receive

them. At the edge of it they rushed upon a loose bank
of pebbles and sand, thrown up by the fabricator:
against this the horses stumbled, and, losing their
balance, fell headlong into the trap. The men behind
wondered to see them suddenly disappear in the dis-
tance, and strained their eyes to look after them. It
was quite dark ere the company that brought the coffin
reached the pitfall, so that, leisurely as they came, all
rolled over the shelf and joined their comrades in the
hollow. There the mingled crowd were lying crushed
and mangled, with broken arms, legs, ribs, and sculls,
some over their steeds and some under them, while
those horses which still had power to move kicked and
plunged and trode their masters to atoms. He who
had dug the huge pit kept quietly at his post, somewhat
oppressed by the weight of one man’s body, nigh the
centre of the gulf, but eagerly expecting the arrival of
Glandreth. Glandreth however was destined to escape
that snare. “ The moon is not yet up,” he cried to his
men, “and we shall have a stream to cross in the
Valley of Palms. Kindle the torches that we may see
our way.” The conqueror was obeyed, and, by the
light which the ﬂaming pine branches cast around them,
he and his companions descried the heaped and the
gaping pitfall. Seized with alarm and astonishment,
Glandreth snatched one of the brands, and went with
the rest to look down into the gulf, where he beheld a
crowd of mangled bodies and heard the groans of the
dying. Phantasmion plainly discerned his enemy, on
whose horr0r-stricken visage the torch-light cast a ﬁerce
glare, gazing into the pit and narrowly eyeing the
scythe-formed weapons of his head which stood out from

the centre of it. Another face gleamed beside his,
beneath a jewelled head-dress: it was that of treacherous
Magnart, whom the indignant youth immediately recog-
nised. After a while the two brothers and their
attendants drew off toward the Vale of Palms, when
with some difﬁculty, Phantasmion dragged himself out
of his den, bringing up his mother’s coﬂin along with
him. He had been miserably bruised, and now feeling
all eagerness to be divested of his hideous mask, would
have cried aloud for the Insect Fairy, but found‘
himself unable to utter any articulate sound. He
looked about and saw not her whom he sought in
woman’s form, yet surmised that she m_ust still be near
him, because a large moth, having the ﬁgure of a scull
depicted on the upper part of its body, kept ﬂitting
around his head, ever and anon uttering a shrill piteous
cry, then sinking down beside him. “She deserted
Dorimant!” thought he; “perhaps she will leave me
also to my fate.” But soon he keenly felt the wretched-
ness of being disabled either from facing his enemies or
escaping from them by ﬂeetness; when a band of
soldiers armed with arrows and javclins, and lighted by
torches, came to take the bodies of their companions out
of the pit. One of them, looking over the plain, espied
the monstrous form under which Phantasmion was dis-
guised, lying stretched upon the sand. He pointed it
out to the rest, who feared to approach, but from a
distance discharged their missiles, many of which struck »
like porcupine quills about the ungainly carcase, and
caused the youth such anguish that he believed he
should expire that night. “ Miserable man that I am,”
he exclaimed, “ or rather miserable spirit of a man, im-

prisoned in a frightful crust, to what dire extremity
have I been driven by mad rage! I have cast away
my human form and faculties only to perish unavenged
by arrows from mine enemy’s quiver !” Still dragging‘
his mother’s coﬁn, he crawled along in hope to gain the
shelter of some rocks, and there to ﬁnd at once a death-
bed and a sepulchre. The moon had now risen, and
cast her light upon those rocks by the time that Phan-
tasmion reached them; but exhausted with fatigue and
pain, he was unable to command the motions of his
monstrous body, his eyes grew dim, he came unawares
to the verge of a stone’ quarry, and moving backwards,
lost his balance, so that he tumbled to the bottom.
Here, when he recovered sense and motion, which his
fall at ﬁrst suspended, he found himself lying under a
vault of stone, with large fragments of rock scattered on
all sides. The moon cast her beams wherever they
could ﬁnd entrance amid the lumber of the quarry, and
all around was an interchange of blackest shade and soft
silver reﬂections. But the attention of the miserable
transformed youth was drawn toward a darksome hollow,
whence he heard low sounds proceed ; and, after listen-
ing a little while, he distinguished two voices, one deep
and sepulchral, the other slender and sweet as that of a
solitary wren which pipes a faint strain when the blast
is silent, and the sun _shines on its cushion of snow.
“ Nevertheless, O save my son!” exclaimed that softer
voice. It seemed as if the tones of the second speaker
came from under ground, while those of the ﬁrst
descended through the air. “What have I to do with
the son of Dorimant? ” was the reply. “I have
expiated my disobedience, great Spirit of the Earth !”

rejoined the voice from above. “ I perished through that
marriage against which thou didst warn me.” “ What
is Phantasmion to me ?” again the Earth Spirit replied ;
“ he hath a helper of his own: and even here, in my
domain, she hath presumed to practise her witcheries ? ”
“ But thou hast triumphed, O Valhorga,” the second
V speaker replied: “ now therefore, I beseech thee, suffer
_P0tentil1a to restore my son.”
While Phantasmion
listened to this colloquy, his soul was ﬁlled with inde-
scribable tumults, and the silence that succeeded to the
last words caused him the most agonising suspense : he
felt as if his strong emotions must rend and break to
shivers that disproportioned case which lay on the earth,
lumpish and uncouth as the half hewn stones around
it. But now the hideous dream has vanished, and once
more Phantasmion stands erect in his own noble form,
splendid as the palm trees, with their leaf-crowned heads
and gorgeous clusters, graceful and majestic as the darker
cypress. The ﬁrst object that met his eye was Potentilla,
whose wand had just wrought the change, ﬂitting away
in‘ the air, her wings growing transparent, her head
triagonal, and her whole body more and more minute,
till she had changed into a dragon-ﬂy, the gay colours of
which twinkled for a moment in the moonlight. She is
gone ! but what pale shadowy form is that which occu-
pies her place, and gazes with such melancholy tender-
ness on the renovated youth ? Phantasmion looking
intently before him remembers the fair and gentle
countenance of his mother. An hour ago how ill could
he have brought to mind the face of Zalia; that face
which, ever beaming in his presence with maternal love,
had been to his young mind the very symbol of

.
maternity. Now he not only recognised her features,
but saw his childish self placed outwardly before him.
The time when he lay in sickness on his little couch,
and saw that soft mild countenance still shining in
betwixt delirious dreams, now occupied his mind with
such intensity, that all which had since occurred seemed
dim and faint in comparison ; as when a distant moonlit
building attracts the eye, all the intervening space looks
indistinct and shadowy because that has been rendered
so conspicuous. Filled with inexpressible yearning,
Phantasmion leaned forward to embrace the form of
Zalia ; but ah ! no living mother watches over him now,
and she who has done him this maternal service is but
an impalpable phantom. “Blessings on thee, my son !"
whispered the spirit ; “ restore my bones to their resting
place, and lay those of my ancient guardian in the same
grave !” Phantasmion eagerly promised to obey, and
then she related that Valhorga once made her mistress
of those precious mines, the report of which induced
Dorimant to marry her; that no sooner had she accepted
his hand than the gift was withdrawn. While Phantas-
mion listened, darkness fell upon an opposite rock, which
had reﬂected the full light of the moon from its humid
front. He looked and saw what seemed to be the
shadow of a giant, leaning forward from a recess hard
by. “ Dorimant could never ﬁnd those mines,” Zalia
' continued. “Alas! it was but iron and gold that he
sought in seeking me! The Earth Spirit knew this
and frustrated his purpose.” “I too need metals!"
exclaimed Phantasmion. “Come then!" his mother
cried, “ and I will show thee where veins of iron have
lurked for ages, undisturbed by the hand of man.”


## p. 300 (#326) ############################################

300 P/zantasmion.
Phantasmion rejoiced at these words; but now he
bethought him of Iarine, and, hoping that he might
lear n where she abode from the kind spirit, he kneeled
down, and, looking earnestly in her face, “ Mother!” he
said, “ knowest thou her to whom I have given thy
coronal, the daughter of Anthemmina ? ” As he uttered
that name a mournful displeasure darkened Zalia’s
countenance, and her face, which hitherto had shone in
the moonlight pure as a ﬂeecy cloud, now appeared to bc
ﬂecked with purple. “ What means this fearful change,
my mother?” exclaimed Phantasmion, “and O! why
dost thou look so mournfully ?" The shade of Zalia
was silent; Phantasmion held up his hands in earnest
supplication, but now his mother’s form gleamed upon
him no longer, and the moonbeams enlightened only the
solid walls of the quarry.
A dawning sun tinged the landscape with its ﬁrst'
pale beam, when Phantasmion heard the voice of the
Earth Spirit calling him from underground :‘—“ Son of
Zalia! follow me !” it cried, “ and thou shalt be
avenged on Glandreth !” “Shall I leave the light of
day!” thought the youth, “ and venture below with
one who may keep me there for ever '5 ” While Phan-
tasmion hesitated, he heard a thundering sound, and at
the same time the masses of rock and walls of stone
began to quiver, as if seized with an ague. The tumult
having subsided, he beheld an opening in the earth,
and from that passage the voice of the Earth Spirit
issued and spoke thus :—“ If thou wilt be avenged on
Glandreth, follow me.” Then Phantasmion thought
that if Valhorga willed his destruction, he had but to
shake the earth a little more forcibly, and straightway

.
he must lie defaced and mangled among the fragments
of the quarry. No sooner had he taken this resolve
than hope led him onward, and all the dark images
which fear had summoned were dissipated in the bright-
ening atmosphere of his soul, like smoky fumes in the
transparent ether. He entered the hollow way, and
groped along, till the last faint glimmering of light had
disappeared, and he stumbled in utter darkness. Awful
noises now assailed his ears, and, as he proceeded, they
grew louder and louder; but his courage never deserted
him, he went right on, till the passage widened, and
brought him to an open space with a ﬁrm but glassy
footing. Here he groped a little way, then stopped,
overcome by the seeming weight of darkness, and the
utter vacancy on every side: when, at once, his eyes
were attracted by sparks of light kindling in the black-
ness above, and soon myriads of fresh stars shone out.
In another moment these ﬁery points shot upward, and
swelled into volumes of ﬂame, which disclosed the ruby
lamps that held them, and a new heaven with gems and
numberless constellations glittering over his head.
Below that sapphirine dome, the ground was of jasper,
embossed with a thousand ﬂower-like jewels; and full
in view were lakes of crystal, emerald groves, and towers
and spires of diamond, which rose from a golden city,
built on many hills, and stretched away in the distance
far as the eye could reach. Over against where he
stood, at the entrance of this gemmy vale, which, by its
over brightness, caused the eye to ache for milder day-
light, Phantasmion beheld a swarthy and gigantic ﬁgure,
leaning on an implement of iron ; his limbs were mus-
cular, his cheeks ploughed with furrows, and his eyes

deep sunk beneath black beetling brows. “Valhorga !”
exclaimed the youth, “it is not gold and jewels that I
seek from thee, but brass and iron; give me sharp
swords to pierce the impious hearts of my enemies, and
let all thy brilliant possessions reﬂect no other light
than that of these subterranean ﬁres !” Valhorga’s
stern brow relaxed, and he smiled upon Phantasmion.
“ Thou shalt have iron and brass enough,” said he, “ to'
make thy armies glitter in the sun, like glaciers on the
bosom of the mountain. Conduct them to the volcano
behind the house of Malderyl, and there they shall be
ﬁtted out to encounter the troops of Glandreth.” Phan-
tasmion’s heart exulted in this promise, but, casting his
eyes around the sparkling scene, he beheld that stony
likeness of a pomegranate tree, whence his mother’s
coronal had been taken ; it grew ‘beside a crystal lake,
which reﬂected the sapphire vault, and stars of car-
buncle and ruby, their ﬂames appearing to quiver on its
ﬁrm smooth face. Then Zalia’_s mournful image came
back into his mind, and he besought Valhorga to
explain the meaning of her sudden change. The
Earth Spirit made reply :—“ Malderyl persuaded thy
mother to taste poisonous berries, averring that they
were sent by the Flower Spirit, and would render her
beloved in the eyes of her neglectful spouse. Zalia still
clings to the error which haunted her dying bed, and
believes that Feydeleen sought her life for the sake of
Anthemmina.” Then Valhorga disclosed the ancient
feud which had rendered Malderyl and Melledine bitter
enemies, both to the house of Thalimer, and the race of
Palmland, and Phantasmion found that Dariel, whose
scarf he still wore across his bosom, was the brother of

Ulander, and had been sent by the Tigridian queen to
work his ruin.
This discourse inspired him with fresh desire to
encounter his foes, and fresh hope that he should pre-
vail against them ere long, by Valhorga’s aid. The
Spirit of the Storm he feared not. “ Anthemmina’s
dying day,” thought he, “is long since past, and her
vow to serve Glandreth must have expired.” With a
joyful heart he quitted that sapphirine sky, and pursued
another dark winding passage, till it led him up into
the light of day. When he emerged, the sun' was
shining in meridian splendour, and he found himself in
the midst of I’enselimer’s army, with the numerous
bands of Gemmaurians and fugitives from Palmland,
who had ﬂocked around him. They had assembled on
the sandy tract, and were greatly at a loss to know
what had become of the young monarch, scouts having
been sent on all sides to look for him in vain. Great
was the astonishment of Penselimer when he beheld the
earth gape a little way from the place where he stood,
and Phantasmion come forth in helmet, shield, and
breastplate of diamonds, which sparkled like icicles in
the sunshine, though not to be melted by the hottest
ray. “ This jewelled armour,” cried the king of Palm-
land, “is a pledge from Valhorga, the Spirit of the
Earth: soon it shall be exchanged for a more service-
able suit, and every soldier of our numerous host
shall receive the same harness as myself. Let us march
to the volcanic mountain of Tigridia, there to be
equipped for battle and victory.” Acclamations rent

to his whole army in his brilliant array, so that all were
inspired with conﬁdence, and eager to start for the
mountain of Malderyl. Phantasmion delayed their
march, while he interred his mother’s remains, with
the body of her faithful guardian, in a secret but hon-
oured grave: those rites performed, the united armies
set forth on their distant expedition.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
ARZENE WANDERS IN SEARCH OF KARADAN TO A BAY,
WHENCE HE HAS JUST SET SAIL WITH IARINE.
“ THE spring returns, andibalmy budding ﬂow’rs
Revive in memory all my childish hours, .
When pleasures were as bright and fresh, though brief,
As petals of the May or silken leaf.
But now when kingcups ope their golden eyes,
I see my darling’s brighten with surprise,
And rival tints that little cheek illume
When eglantine displays her richest bloom.
Dear boy l thou art thy mother’s vernal ﬂow’r,
Sweeter than those she loved in childhood’s hour,
And spring renews my earliest ecstasy,
By bringing buds and fresh delights for thee.”
WITH tearful eyes Arzene murmured this song, and
seemed to see the childish form of Karadan sporting
before her, as when she sang it ﬁrst. No one gave
tidings of her son at the hamlet where she had spent
the night, but the goatherd had expressed a belief, from
inquiries which the youth made, that he and his fair
companion were bound for the Tigridian coast, and
thither she directed her steps. ‘At mid-day she entered
a sunny ﬁeld, where the reapers were busy at work, and
women were binding sheaves. There she sate below the

shady fence to rest, and saw a little boy collecting corn
poppies, which the sickle had cut down, while his sister
was busy in gathering the scattered ears. “ Idle child!"
cried the laden girl, “what hast thou gleaned, I pray?
will those gaudy ﬂowers make bread?” “ Bread for
bees!” replied the urchin. “If thou art a busy bee,
thou canst make bread of ﬂowers.” So saying, with a
laugh, he ﬂung his posy at the chider’s face, and a
shower of the proﬁtless blossoms fell down into her arm-
ful of corn. Arzene thought of her own playful Her-’
millian and young Arimel, who loved to forestall woman-
hood, and step into her mother’s place, till the golden
crop and the bending groups swam through her tears,
and, starting from her seat, she resolved forthwith to
seek no more for him who ‘scorned her anxious love, but
return to her other children. In this mind she turned
her face from the village, whither she had intended to
proceed, and, having partaken of the reapers’ fare, which
they charitably offered, she travelled on in another direc-
tion till the day was far spent. Then, sitting down
again to rest, she heard the wind sigh dolefully, and saw
the black shadow of a tree on a smooth green slope
Wave slowly up and down. Arzene was thinking with
deep sorrow of her_ truant son, and now she seemed to
hear his voice, and to see his image reproaching her
change of purpose. She arose, and again resolved to
seek along the coast for Karadan. Scarce hoping to
reach the sea that night, she journeyed, however, to- _ .
wards it, till she entered a ﬁeld that was bathed in the
clear melancholy sunshine, and contained a clump of
dark holm oaks, about which a rivulet wound like a
silver chain. Just across that brook, a shepherdess was

sitting, while her ﬂocks nibbled the green grass on its
margin. Arzene would scarce have seen her among the
trees, but the notes of her song, while the words were
inaudible, came across the ﬁeld to her ear, and she went
up to the place where the maiden sate, with the inten-
tion of begging a shelter for that night. “Go on with
thy sweet song,” said Arzene, courteously, when the
damsel rose at her approach: “ I will sit beside thee on
this fallen log.” The shepherdess renewed her melody,
and these were the words of her song:
Full oft before some gorgeous fans
The youngling heifer bleeds and dies;
Her life-blood issuing forth amain,
While wreaths of incense climb the skies.
The mother wanders all around,
Through shadowy grove and lightsome glade;
Her foot-marks on the yielding ground
Will prove what anxious quest she made.
The stall where late her darling lay
She visits oft with eager look :
In restless movements wastes the day,
And ﬁlls with cries each neighbouring nook.
She roams along the willowy copse,
Where purest waters softly gleam:
But ne’er a leaf or blade she crops,
Nor crouches by the gliding stream.
No youthful kine, though fresh and fair,
Her vainly searching eyes engage;
No pleasant ﬁelds relieve her care,
No murmuring streams her grief assuage.


## p. 308 (#334) ############################################

308 P/zantasmion.
The words of this song struck painfully on the sad
mother’s heart. Her face was bathed in tears, and,
while she drooped forward, absorbed in bitter thought,
the light-hearted shepherdess gathered her ﬂock, and
went away. After awhile, Arzene remembered that
she had not where to take her rest that night, and
strove to overtake the damsel, but, having followed her
for some time, she became exhausted, and laid her down
to sleep in a waste ﬁeld. The sun had just risen, and
turned the dew drops around Arzene’s bed into diamonds,
when Karadan entered the ﬁeld where his ‘mother slept.
From the top of a lofty mullein a goldﬁnch piped beside
her, and soon his new-ﬂedged offspring, led by their
other parent, alighted on tall plants around, buoyantly
‘swaying back and forward as they pecked the winged
seeds. Arzene saw not the gleeful group: in dreams
she had wandered back to her own deserted little ones,
and knew not, that he for whose sake she had left them
was weeping over her. While the youth still gazed on
his mother’s face, Iarine came beside him. He started,
and would have drawn her away, “ Come,” he said in
a low voice, “ our path lies yonder. I bade thee wait
till I had explored this ﬁeld.” But Iarine had recog-
nized the features of her who slept, and wondering
much at the behaviour of Karadan; “Wilt thou leave
thy mother alone in this strange land?” she said.
Anguish was depicted on his face, but he answered
ﬁrmly, “We must leave Arzene, or thou may’st forego
all hope of beholding Anthemmina.” “ She is come in
search of thee from her distant home,” said the maid;
“wilt thou not stay till she wakes, and tell her thy
purpose?” “Then it would never be effected,”


## p. 309 (#335) ############################################

A rzene in searc/ z of Karadan. 309
/Karadan replied. “Take thy choice; return with
Arzene, or seek Anthemmina.” Iarine looked at the
y0uth’s countenance of woe, and guessed that if the
mother beheld her son, she would never suffer him to
pursue his journey. With a sorrowful heart she quitted
the ﬁeld, accompanied Karadan to the sea-shore, and
there remained in a ﬁsherman’s hut, while he went in
‘quest of a vessel. But Iarine knew only that she was
to await the youth’s return; for so strict a silence had
he kept, and enjoined on her, concerning their errand,
that she knew not whether her mother's abode were to
be approached by sea or land.
After some hours he returned, placed her on the
mule, and, holding the reins, led it by rugged paths
over a ridge of rocks, from the top of which Iarine
beheld a skiff anchored in a little bay. Still carefully
guiding the mule, Karadan descended, and soon he had
entered the vessel with his companion. “Does the
wind blow favourably?” inquired the maid, as she
helped him to unfurl the sails. She heard not the
reply, but a gurgling sound of laughter issued from
under the waves, circling all round the vessel, and pro-
longed by a succession of fainter and fainter echoes. As
a pebble, thrown by a dexterous hand, repeatedly
touches the water, then sinks out of sight, even so the
sounds were many times renewed till they died into
silence. Iarine looked aghast, but heard no comment
on that ill-boding mirth from her companion, whose
countenance did not regain its gloomy composure ere
the skiﬁ" had cleared the bay. Smoothly then it sailed,
till land was again in sight, and Iarine’s countenance
glowed, while that of Karadan became livid as a corse.

On a sudden, however, an impetuous gale arose, and
' drove back the vessel from the point toward which the
melancholy helmsman was steering; having impelled it
far into mid-ocean the wind relented, but rose again as
often as the skiff approached the shore. Karadan
knew what power was frustrating his efforts, and in a
presentiment of this delay, had stored the ship with pro-
visions. The damsel prayed that the elemental strife
might cease, but Karadan would have rejoiced could this
state of things have lasted for ever.
Meantime Arzene tarried in the creek whence her son
had sailed, vainly expecting his return. Scarce had the
youth and maiden left the ﬁeld where she lay, than the
deserted mother awoke, and saw Feydeleen weeping by
her side. “Why weepest thou, fair one ? ” Arzene
cried; “Shall I never again behold his face ?”
“Thou shalt behold his face again,” the mild spirit
answered; but still the tears were trickling from her
soft blue eyes upon the ﬂowery sod. “Where shall I
ﬁnd him ?” exclaimed Arzene. Feydeleen replied,
“ Not far from hence there is a narrow bay, encircled by
rocks, where a hermit dwells nigh the sea shore. ‘There,
after some days, thou shalt behold thy son. When that
time comes I will again be with thee, and will bring my
choicest gifts to preserve him from all future harm.”
The spirit vanished, and Arzene, going to the sea
shore, learnt from an oldiman who dwelt in a cave
of the rock, that ayouth and damsel had lately sailed
from the narrow bay in a skiff brought from another
part of the coast. Conﬁding in Feydeleen’s assurance,
she took up her abode with the hermit, and, from morn
till eve, continued to watch the restless ocean, oft revert-

ing in thought to this strain, which had been sung in
happier days amid the blooming bowers of Polyanthida.
See yon blithe child that dances in our sight ?
Can gloomy shadows fall from one so bright?
Fond mother, whence these fears ?
While buoyantly he rushes o’er the lawn,
Dream not of clouds to stain his manhood’s dawn,
Nor dim that sight with tears.
No cloud he spies in brightly glowing hours,
But feels as if the newly vested bowers
' For him could never fade :
Too well we know that vernal pleasures ﬂeet,
But having him, so gladsome, fair, and sweet, .
Our loss is overpaid.
Amid the balmiest ﬂowers that earth can give
Some bitter drops distil, and all that live
A mingled portion share;
But, while he learns these truths which we lament,
Such fortitude as ours will sure be sent,
Such solace to his care.

CHAPTER _XL.
THE ALLIED FORCES ARE EQUIPPED WITH ARMOUR IN
THE HEART OF THE VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN.
WHILE Phantasmion was conducting his forces through
Tigridia, Malderyl sate in her ancient tower full of angry
thoughts. After the murder of Dorimant’s queen, as
she traversed Gemmaura in her chariot, she had fallen
into the power of the Earth Spirit. But Valhorga, who
hated Dorimant, released the witch that she might
accomplish her projects against him: at the same time
he gave her two dwarfs, endowed with Wondrous powers,
intending on a future occasion, to fetch both her and
them into slavery. Malderyl despatched an emissary to
Palmland, who planted so many sweet but balefulherbs
in Dorimant's domain, that the honey of the bees was
infected with it, and the king, regaling himself thereon,
was poisoned. But Phantasmion was now beyond the ‘
reach of her vengeful arm, while Zelneth and Leucoia,
whom she once hoped to enslave, had both escaped her
' snares. Swartho crouched at the queen's feet, grinning
maliciously as he viewed her knitted brows ; for he knew
that Valhorga had espoused the cause of Zalia’s son, and
that soon he should return to serve his ancient master.
That evening Malderyl went forth to visit the ancient
castle where Phantasmion last beheld Oloola. Gloomy
thoughts possessed her soul as she ascended the tower

whence her husband and her son, by Glandreth's com-
mand, had been cast upon the ﬂagstones below. There
she stood, while the twilight was deepening into dark-
ness, and saw the ghosts of Helmio and Sylvalad ﬂutter-
ing about the parapet, and beckoning, with earnest
gesticulations, as if they invited her to throw herself
down. She watched them till her head grew dizzy, and
she almost felt tempted to obey the summons. Their
motions were like those of swallows teaching their young
to ﬂy. One after another, each gleaming ghost would
perch on the battlements, a little way oﬂ', look eagerly .
towards her, then plunge into the court beneath. As
they ﬂitted away in a curving line, both swept by
Malderyl, looked in her face reproachfully, and pointed
to the horizon, just as the moon, emerging from clouds,
cast a clearer light upon the‘landscape, and enabled her
to descry an army encamped upon the plain. Then
back she hied to her house upon the hill, and com-
manded Swartho to raise pictures on the wall, and show
her what was coming. He obeyed, but when she looked
to have seen chariots and horses, and men in armour,
mockery ﬂames quivered around, and she stood in the
midst of a seeming furnace. Malderyl shrieked, and,
rushing forth, beheld the mountain crested with ﬁre.
Twice did a pyramid of ﬂame burst forth from a lofty
eminence above the mansion, twice it sank back, as if
sucked in by a mighty force : the third time it remained,
a steady blaze, which made the moon and stars appear
to shine in vain. As fast as her tottering limbs could
carry her she descended the skirt of the hill, and would
have made her way through a plantation of ﬁrs and
pines, but started when suddenly she beheld all the

trees before her glowing with ﬁre, the trunks and
branches and every needle leaf appearing red hot.‘
Meantime, with a crash like thunder, the ancient mansion
was levelled with the ground. Torrents of ﬁre gushed
down the ravines above, and Malderyl saw that she must
soon be overtaken by the ﬂames. Again she looked at
the plantation of ﬁrs, thinking to rush through the
midst of it; but in front of that ﬁery grove stood the
towering form of Valhorga, whose wild locks and rugged
cheeks looked awful in the glare of the conﬂagration.
“Fear not the ﬂames, Malderyl,” he said, with a grim
smile ; “ thou shalt ply thy burning tasks unhurt.” , S0
saying, he touched her with his iron mace, when she
became ﬁre proof, and seeing that she was now con-
demned to endless toil in the bowels of the earth, she
repented not having thrown herself down from the tower,
that her spirit might‘wander at large with the ghosts of
Helmio and Sylvalad. She followed Valhorga through the
glowing pine grove, and at the other end of it beheld the
‘ army, which she had seen at a distance, approaching the
volcano, while Phantasmion, radiant with diamonds, led
them on. They had descried the conﬂagration, and
believing it to be a signal from Valhorga, resumed their
march at midnight. And this was not the only host
which the light of those ﬂames had attracted: from the
woods of Nemorosa came Ulander, conducting his troops
of tiger hunters, clad in shaggy skins, and armed with
bows, arrows, and javelins.
Valhorga waved his hand, and the ﬂames, which looked
like a billowy sea, now rolled away, curling upwards to
the top of the mountain, and there forming a ﬁery
coronal. By the light of that blaze Phantasmion~beheld

a vaulted passage, occupying the place where Malderyl's
mansion had stood. He beckoned to Phantasmion, and,
as the youth followed him through the-avenue, which
received light from within, he heard a chaos of sounds,
and soon entered a vast cavern hollowed out in the heart
of the mountain. At the farther end was a huge hill
of .ﬁre, ‘whence smoke and ﬂame rose up through a
chimney that formed the crater of the volcano. Innume-
rable swarthy labourers were ranged in this vast smithy,
row within row: one company softened the blocks of
metal, then quenched them in vessels of water; another
fashioned them on the anvil ; every process in the forma-
tion of armour was going on, and every thing used in
war was made in this workshop. The roaring of the
ﬂames and bellows, the hissing of the metal when plunged
in water, the clattering and jingling of hammer and
anvil, produced a din which almost deafened the ears of
Phantasmion. Malderyl took her place among the toil-
ing crew, and helped to make the shield which was after-
wards worn by the son of Dorimant. As fast as the
suits were made ready, the bands of warriors entered to
ﬁt them on, and ere the morning dawned, they were all
equipped except Ulander. For he had espied Malderyl,
as she followed her master into the cavern, and, guessing
that her time of punishment was come, felt loth to wit-
ness it. The whole throng of artiﬁcers had withdrawn
to the haunts whence the Earth Spirit had summoned
them, and Phantasmion was the only warrior that re-
mained in the mighty dome. At one end of the cavern
Valhorga leaned against a rock, resembling the gigantic
eﬂigies which some nations carve in the sides of moun-
tains. “Why does Ulander tarry ?” cried the king of

Palmland, as he looked at the shield of one last suit
which Malderyl was polishing. “ Ay! wh y does Ulander
tarry?” repeated Valhorga, with a stern voice; “tell-
hirn that his armour is finished, and that he must fetch
it, ere it be too late.” But now the Nemorosan chief
appeared entering the cavern, and soon began to doff
the tiger's hide which he wore on his shoulders. The
ancient queen arose when she saw her kinsnian; and
laying hold of his garment, besought him, for his father's
sake, to procure a mitigation of her doom. Then Phan-
tasmion, at Ulander’s treaty, besought Valhorga that
Malderyl might be permitted to die, and join the shades
of Helmio and Sylvalad. The Earth Spirit smiled care-
lessly, and answered, “ Be it as thou wilt." Malderyl,
having heard these words, sprang into the midst of the
blazing ﬁre, when the ﬂames rose up around her, and
she looked like an image of bronze which they blackened '
but vainly attempted to destroy. Valhorga touched her
with his mace, then down she sank upon her ﬁery bed
and was consumed in an instant. While they yet gazed
on the ﬂames the warriors heard a strange unnatural
. sound, that seemed to express pain or grief, and, looking
about, they espied _Swartho in a_ corner of the cavern,
his bright eyes gleaming like jewels set in rusty iron.
Though sorely oppressed by the heat, he had lingered
behind all the other slaves to see what would be done
with Malderyl, and was grieved to the heart that she
should escape the insults by which he had hoped to repay
her former tyranny. Ulander, recollecting his treatment
of Leucoia, was about to pierce the livid breast of the
dwarf with the spear he had just received; but Phan-
tasmion, laying hold of his arm, bade him beware how

he touched a servant of Valhorga, whose mighty form
was yet visible in a recess of the cavern. Then the two
chiefs issued forth into the daylight, and beheld the
united armies ranged upon the plain, their burnished
armour shining coldly in the light of the newly-risen sun.

CHAPTER XLI.
IARINE FINDS HER MOTHER IN THE SEQUESTERED
PENINSULA.
WHILE Phantasmion and his allies were conducting
their armed force to Rockland, driving along with them
. troops of sheep and kine formerly plundered from the
land of Palms, and followed at a distance by a train of
wolves and tigers, which seemed ready to brave any
danger for the sake of obtaining a share in the booty,
Karadan still contended with the impetuous gale. At
length it sank and was no more renewed ; the voyagers
gained the coast and silence reigned on sea and land
while the dark youth placed Iarine on the beach. He
told her how she was to ﬁnd the dwelling of Anthem-
mina, and tears streamed from the maiden's eyes when
he declared that she must seek it alone. “ Farewell ! ”
cried Karadan passionately; a ray of joy, at sight of
those tears, brightening his sad face. “ More than
betrothed thou canst not be to any one but him who
owns this charmed vessel, and thou hast been betrothed
to 1ne!—Alas! that wreath upon thy brow !—When
next we meet may it be there no longer! Then thou
wilt know that I have ventured for thy sake as he who
gave that pledge will never dare to do." Sorrowful
indeed was the parting of Iarine and Karadan, while
each had a heart full of the gloomiest forebodings; but

little did either suspect what worse calamity awaited the
other. Karadan stood at the vessel's prow and watched
the maiden, hurrying with tremulous feet, along the
rocky coast; again and again she turned to wave her
hand, and beheld him still keeping his station ; at last
she disappeared, and her garment, ﬂuttering behind her,
vanished out of sight. Then Karadan fastened the
pitcher securely to his body, steered away his skiff into the
deep water, and looking to the sky, beheld, just dawning
into view, a winged form, which, since he ﬁrst beheld
it, had a thousand times been present to his nightly
slumbers. He waited not to see the dreaded shape
more fully revealed, but plunged into the waves and
perished, the charmed vessel remaining still bound to a
heart which fear and love could agitate no longer.
Unconscious of his miserable fate Iarine pursued her
way to Anthemmina’s abode. No living creature met
her eye as she hastened on amid sickly herbage or
blighted bushes, and the sky wore a leaden hue even
more melancholy than that of the plain. Once she_
looked up and beheld a ﬂight of swallows, which soon
descended, like a shower of dappled stones, and lay
dead on the ground before her. The farther she ad-
vanced the more pining and desolate the face of nature
appeared. Beyond the cliffs of the shore she journeyed
over a perfectly level plain, and, after a time, the turrets
of a solitary dwelling came within view amid the tops of
spiral cypresses; Just such a landscape Iarine had
beheld in mournful dreams, and she hurried on, hoping
by quick motion to escape the i sad feelings which the
scene re-awakened. After passing a collection of low
mounds like graves, she gained the cypress wood, and,

advancing through it, soon found herself in front of that
mansion which she had seen at a distance. The door
stood open, and Iarine entered, but no one greeted her
at the threshold. She traversed many empty apart-
ments, all such as would have beﬁtted a palace; they
were decorated with black marble and costly hangings,
but the colours of the drapery had ﬂed, while the orna-
ments and utensils around were tarnished and rusty.
She visited a small chamber which contained a bed,
hoping to ﬁnd some tokens of living inhabitants; the
bed was occupied, the body of an old man being laid out
there, and branches of cypress mixed with yew arranged
over the head of the corse. This solemn sight assured
Iarine that some one yet survived in the house or
its neighbourhood. She retraced her steps, quitted the
mansion, and having crossed the grove that extended
behind it, descried two ﬁgures, standing beside a bound-
less sheet of sluggish, lurid water. On she went, and
beheld a stately lady all hung over with blue garlands
of star-shaped blossoms, her long black tresses ﬂoating
wide, and her head and neck adorned with strings of
pearl. An aged woman, who held a basket, seemed to
be contending with her, while she persisted in throwing
cakes of bread afar into the marsh with an air of sullen
ﬁerceness: her companion, having tried in vain to stop
her hand, let fall the empty basket, and crossed her
arms in all the tranquillity of settled despair.
On Iarine’s approach the Women in humble apparel
turned about and looked at her in astonishment; but
the majestic lady continued to gaze upon the marsh.
The maiden felt unable to speak, but, perusing her face
with deep anxiety, felt assured that 'she beheld her

another. The outline of her form and features was
grandly beautiful; but her cheeks were white’as Wax,
her blue eyes spectrally bright, and her delicate arms
and ﬁngers wasted to the bone. There was something
wild and ghastly in her countenance, and strangely it
was contrasted with that of her companion, who seemed
benumbed by misery, but not bewildered. “ 'Who art
thou ?” said the feeble creature, “ and why hast thou
come hither to see us perish, and to perish thyself when
we are gone ? ” “Art thou not Dorna, my mother’s
. nurse?” replied the damsel, “ and is not this Anthem-
mina, the wife of Albinian ?” “Woe is me! thou
sayest true,” replied the aged woman ; “ and surely thou
art the sweet Iarine, whom this wretched lady left in the
Palace of Rockland, when she quitted it never to
return.” All this time Anthemmina remained with her
eyes ﬁxed upon the stagnant water, speechless and
motionless. The damsel related who she was, and how
she had come to that coast, tenderly addressing her
mother, but obtaining not a word, nor even a single
glance, in return; till at last, she took her hand and '
implored her to break this fearful silence. Then she
who was so gaily bedecked looked up, and, beholding
the wreath of jewelled ﬂowers, gazed at it with an
astonished countenance. “Zalia,” she cried, at length,
her eyes kindling with frenzy ; “ art thou come instead
of Dorimant ?” Then, with a wild shriek, she snatched
the chaplet from the maiden’s brow, and trampled it
under her feet. Heart-stricken and overpowered, I arine
sank upon the ground at the feet of the once gentle and
captivating Anthemmina. She had found her mother,
but alas! in what state! Here was the goodly fabric,

to outward view still perfect: all the wondrous materials
were yet in being, but the springs within had failed,
and the whole was a wreck.
“ We are starving !” Dorna cried; “ no fresh provi-
sions have been sent us for many months, and our last
remnant of food now lies in yonder marsh. Alas!
my mistress feels no trouble concerning things like
these. Sorrow and the noxious vapours of this pool
have turned her brain, and daily she decks herself, as
when she ﬁrst came hither, still expecting to be visited
by Dorimant, king of Palmland.” “ How came she
hither '4” Iarine exclaimed. “ By the arts of Glandret ,”
Dorna answered, “ a storm drove our vessel to this deso-
late coast, but that storm was raised by Glandreth’s
power. In those days the wicked chief was enamoured
of my mistress, and, I doubt not, beguiled her with
feigned tales, saying that Queen Zalia was near her
end, and that, when she died, Dorimant would carry
her into Palmland. So she trusted herself with him,
and, never consenting to become his wife, has remained
his wretched captive. I will tell thee more while we
repair to the beach : let us go in haste lest thy conductor
should sail away." “He bade me return to my own
country by land,” replied the maiden; “ saying that this
peninsula could scarce be a day's journey from the
chief palace of Rockland.” “ If he is gone we must all
perish!” Dorna replied; “there is no passage hence
by land. The place is separated from Rockland and
Tigridia by this vast marsh, the exhalations whereof are
so baleful that any birds which attempt to wing their
way high in the air above it are sure to perish. All ’
our household have died, one after another, of lingering

maladies; the last survivor expired yesterday, and
strength will fail me, I fear, to dig his grave.” During
this discourse Anthemmina sate upon the ground, weav-
ing a fresh garland, and sometimes raising her head to
cast sullen glances at the unhappy maid. Dorna hied
away to the sea shore, hoping yet to hail Karadan's
vessel, while Iarine stood beside her mother absorbed
in silent grief.

PHANTASMION AND HIS ALLIES JOIN BATTLE WITH GLAND-
RETH IN THE VALLEY OF THE BLACK LAKE.
STRUGK with consternation at sight of the united army,
the people of Rockland had oﬂered no resistance, but
had forthwith despatched messengers to Glandreth, and
while Phantasmion was gazing on the Island where
Iarine used to dwell, it was announced that the
conqueror was about to enter the valley of the Black
Lake with his victorious forces. Soon afterwards the
foremost bands of the enemy were descried at a dis-
tance, and were hailed by the men of Palmland with
this chant :-—
Their armour is ﬂashing,
And ringing and clashing, \
Their looks are wild and savage!
With deeds of night
They have darken’d the light,
They are come from reckless ravage!
O bountiful Earth,
With famine and dearth,
With plague and ﬁre surround them;
Thy womb they have torn
With impious scorn;
Let its tremblings now confound them!
Our cause maintain.
For as dew to the plain,

Or wind to the slumbering sea,
Or sunny sheen
To woodlands green,
So dear have we been to thee.
The new-blown ﬂowers,
From thy fairest bowers,
Their riﬂing hands have taken;
And the tree’s last crop,
That was ready to drop,
From the dews have rudely shaken ;
Through deep green dells,
Where the bright stream wells,
Like diamond with emerald blending;
Through sheltered vales,
Where the light wind sails,
High cedars scarcely bending;
Through lawn and grove,
Where the wild deer rove,
They have rush’d like a burning ﬂood;
For morning’s beam,
Or the starry gleam,
Came ﬁre, and sword, and blood.
Then lend us thy might,
Great Earth, for the ﬁght,
O help us to quell their pride;
Make our sinews and bones
As ﬁrm as the stones,
And metals that gird thy side;
May the smould’ring mountains,
And ﬁery fountains
Inﬂame our vengeful ire,
And beasts that lurk,
In thy forests murk,
Their tameless rage inspire;
While from caves of death
Let a sluggish breath

O’er the spoilers’ spirits creep,
O send to their veins
The chill that reigns
In thy channels dark and deep.
But if those we abhor
Must triumph in war
Let us sink to thy inmost centre,
Where the trump’s loud sound,
Nor the tramp and the bound,
Nor the conqueror’s shout can enter;
Let mountainous rocks,
By earthquake shocks,
High o’er our bones be lifted;
And piles of snow
Where we sleep below,
To the plains above be drifted;
If the murderous band
Must dwell in the land,
And the ﬁelds we loved to cherish,
From the land of palm
Let cedar and palm
With those that rear’d them perish.
Phantasmion knew so well how the land lay in this
mountainous region that Penselimer desired him to take
the lead in all orders and dispositions of war ; he had
already shown the herdsmen how they might drive their
bleating and lowing troops across the hills into Palmland,
and he now joyfully proceeded to marshal the allied
armies and conduct them to the most advantageous post.
Flanked by the lake and its deep banks on one side,
and on the other by a woody brow, they were soon
drawn out in order of battle; the long winding ﬁles
were quickly transformed to squares, clothing every inch
of green turf and purple heather with brass and steel as

fast as a painter’s brush invests a pannel with new colours.
The ground covered by the front line rose gradually at
either end, toward the lake and toward the mountain,
so that the troops were ranged in form of a semicircle.
The centre of the van was occupied by Phantasmion
with his light Gemmaurian cavalry, whose helmets were
surmounted with carbuncles representing ruddy ﬂames;
but the young monarch’s own crest was of diamonds,
and displayed the ﬁgure of a damsel holding a pitcher.
The Nemorosan spearmen were placed on either 'wing,
Ulander commanding the division ﬂanking the hill. His
foresters wore casques crested with the grim visage of a
gaping tiger. The king of Almaterra divided his large
force into two squadrons, taking charge himself of that
which held the middle ground, while Delmorin, son of
Sanio, commanded the rear. Some companies of archers,
wearing stag’s horns on their helmets, were posted by
Phantasmion among ﬁr trees on the slope of the hill,
where fan-shaped branches, growing close to the ground,
kept them in ambush, though now and then their sylvan
crests peeped out amid the leaves.
Meantime Glandreth was rapidly advancing and ﬁlling
the plain opposite to that narrower space which Phan-
tasmion's front line occupied, and which looked like the
contracted girth of the valley. His force appeared
innumerable, and had been swollen by accessions from
Palmland, together with certain well-ordered battalions
brought by traitorous Magnart, whom the mighty pro-
mises aml mysterious hints of Glandreth had persuaded
to strengthen the strong cause, and desert that of Albinet.
The chief now sate beside his brother in a stately car
which preceded the army, and listened to his talk with

deep attention; Glandreth pointed to the sky, and Mag-
nart seemed more bent on watching the appearances
there than on surveying the ground and the enemy’s
array of battle. The aspect of that well-accoutred host,
reﬂecting a bright sun from burnished armour, was
indeed an unwelcome surprise to the mighty general;
and, though his own was still more numerous, he could
not hope to surround and overpower his opponents with
multitudes of horse, by reason of their having secured
so advantageous a position. Nevertheless, Glandreth
was free from even a shadow of dread, and beheld the
furious onset of his foes, when the battle began, without
concern; for it was not in sword and buckler, nor in
stout hands and hearts, that he reposed his trust; he
had summoned other powers to his aid, and a dark massy
cloud which followed his course, or paused with him,
right over his head, while the cope of heaven around
was crystal clear, assured him of victory.
Phantasmion saw that cloud and his heart was
troubled; seen indeed it must needs have been by every
one present, but he of all the assembled multitude alone
surmised that it was aught more than a collection of
vapours, he alone imagined that it contained such an
ally of Glandreth as no mortal power might withstand.
Perplexing conjectures engrossed his mind; he thought
of Oloola’s doubtful conduct at former junctures; he
strove to think that she was no real enemy to his cause;
he believed that Anthemmina’s dying day was long
since passed; yet why did that black cloud continue to
hover above the head of Glandreth, and what did it por-
tend? While the other chiefs, animated with the most
conﬁdent hopes, were performing feats of valour, Phantas-

mion’s brow was ‘overcast, and, for a little while, the
buoyancy and ardour of his temperament appeared to
have forsaken him.
Soon, however, the young monarch roused himself
from anxious speculation, and led on the troops with all
his wonted energy. Phantasmion eagerly desired to
encounter Glandreth ; but lo! the chieftain, conspicuous
‘by his long white plume and lofty stature, resigns the
command to Magnart, who leads the vanguard, and,
retiring from the ﬁght, ascends a bare rock, just apart
from the conﬂict, whence he obtains a full view of the
hills above and of the plain beneath. Triumphantly
from that eminence he cast his eyes around, having
reason to believe that, in a few moments, every object he
beheld would be absolutely subjected to his power.
Below where he stood were the contending armies, the
ﬂashing of armour, the tramp of horses, the clang of
sword and shield. On the green hill side he observed ‘
the numerous sheep and herds which now belonged to
his adversaries: with scarce perceptible motion they
were stealing onward, while ever and anon their con-
ductors turned about to look upon the ﬁeld of combat.
Part of the ﬂocks had already disappeared, having
wound their way into a rocky gorge, while the rest were
following. Glandreth’s heart swelled with scornful
exu!tationas he looked upon them. “Now,” thought
he, “ere those ﬂocks are out of sight the plunderers
shall have felt my power; at one stroke I will
change the scene, and my enemies shall be crushed
for ever.” At this moment success appeared inclining
toward the less numerous army; Magnart had fallen by
the hand of Phantasmion, and his body was trampled

under foot by the throng; Penselimer, with his heavy
armed troops, powerfully supported the Gemmaurian
cavalry; and the archers placed behind the ﬁr trees,
like a herd of armed deer, came rushing down to attack
the enemy in ﬂank. Glandreth beheld Phantasmion,
after he had given Magnart his death-blow, pressing
onwards and striving to win his way to the place where
he stood. Then he lifted up his glittering blade and
shouted, “Come on, Phantasmion !” The rocks were
still resounding that cry, when a far different echo came
from the cloud over his head. “ Phantasmion !—Phan-
tasmion !-—Come on, Phantasmion ! ” was uttered from
above in a tone more shrill and piercing than that of
the chieftain, more like the sound of the wind than that
of any human voice ; it prevailed over the din of battle ;
every ear heard it; every eye was ﬁxed on the black
mass, and every weapon was suspended. But the dense,
pitchy cloud remained unchanged and motionless, and
had a preternatural appearance alone in the pure
blue sky.
Phantasmion gazed at it, as he listened with awe but
not with terror to that aerial challenge; an eye of
intense light now became visible in the centre of the
darkness; it grew and spread till he seemed for a
moment to perceive the indistinct lineaments of a
dazzling face, and at the same time a hand glanced forth
and beckoned him. Feelings akin to frenzy possessed
the young warrior at that sight; he resolved to know
his fate, and not to die without having essayed at least
to punish the iniquitous transgressor; he spurred his
horse, and began to drive right onward through the!
ranks, which made way before him. Then once more

Glandreth raised his sword, and pointed to Phantasmion,
While he cast up his face to the sky, and called upon
Oloola. The call was heard; a gush of lightning burst
from the cloud, quivered adown the uplifted blade, and
clothed, as with a robe of ﬁre, the mailed body of Glan-
dreth. A moment he stood enveloped in ﬂames; the
blasted corse then tumbled from the rock, and, just as
Phantasmion arrived, rolled down at the feet of his
courser. ,
No noisy peal followed this vengeful lightning; no
cry was uttered at the fall of Glandreth ; silence was in
the sky, amid the mountains, and on the motionless
lake, and the armed multitudes, lately engaged in the
turmoil of conﬂict, were still as the stones and rocks.
Arrow-shaped particles of innocuous ﬂame were diffused
around; each combatant beheld them gliding over the
polished helm and breastplate of his neighbour, and all
fell terror-stricken with their faces to the earth. Phan-
tasmion alone was exempted from the blinding glare;
silent, yet calm, he sate on his unmoving steed, which
hung his head, and like all living things around, seemed
stupiﬁed with amazement. Unappalled he sate, his
head thrown back to gaze on the dark cloud, which
slowly ascended and gradually brightened, as if some
luminous body within were eating away it coal-black
shroud. That shroud became thinner and thinner,
revealing more and more of a winged form, till at last,
when it was perfectly transparent, the ﬂoating locks and
outspread pinions of Oloola, ere she disappeared in the
upper sky, were dimly visible.

CHAPTER XLIII.
ANTHEMMINA~DIES IN THE PRESENCE OF IARINE AND
PHANTASMION.
PHANTASMION was still gazing upward, when he discerned
in the sky that angelic vision which ﬁrst made him long
to soar aloft; at the same time a well known voice
whispered in his ear, “Come, and ﬁnd Iarine." Then
he felt himself enabled to quit the earth, and, rising
buoyantly into the air, pursued Iarine’s image over hill
and dale. But when at last the apparition melted
away, he saw his guardian Fairy ﬂitting on before him;
swiftly they traversed the Land of Rocks, passed the
Diamanthine Palace, and ﬂew above the waves till they
descried an empty vessel drifting about at random.
Phantasmion followed Potentilla when she entered the
skiff, and no sooner had they alighted on the deck than
the pinions of both disappeared, and the Fairy, sitting
at the helm, appeared like some ancient pilot. “ In
this boat,” she said, “ Karadan conducted Iarine to the
place of her mother’s exile : in this boat thou shalt bear
Iarine away, but death alone can release Anthemmina.”
The Fairy then disclosed what Oloola’s power had long
forced her to conceal, how Albinian's ﬁrst queen had
been tempted by Glandreth, how she came to the Lost
Land which was cut oﬂ' from the neighbour countries
by an impassable marsh, and shunned by seafarers on

account of fearful traditions and predictions connected
with its name. “On that dreary coast she roamed,”
continued Potentilla, “ till at length every cloud, which
hung about the sun’s globe and steeped its ﬂeece in
splendour, seemed growing into the likeness of Dorimant,
every changeful mist that rose from the wave seemed
about to take his form. Thus she fared till not a vestige
of her former being remained but that one miserable
dream. Glandreth meant to have sailed with fresh
provisions the day after the battle ; but Anthemmina, in
frenzy, had cast the scanty remnant into the water, and
by hasteningthe day of her death released Oloola from
a vow long repented of : thus was she enabled to punish
the wickedness of Glandreth, and thus hath his cruelty
recoiled on his own head.” “But Karadan,” inquired
the youth, while the skiff went forward with a favour-
able breeze, “ how knew he where to ﬁnd Iarine’s
mother ?” “ Karadan,” she replied, “ was visiting his
fair young cousin in the Land of Rocks, when Glandreth
laid his plan for . carrying off the queen. By way of a
childish frolic, he hid himself in the lower part of the
ship, and remained unseen by the chieftain till he was
about to sail away from the peninsula. Then coming
forward, he fearfully exclaimed, “Where is the queen?
O where is all the crew? Thou wilt not leave them on this
barren coast ‘i ” While he spoke thus, Oloola made her-
self manifest in thunder and lightning : his young spirit
was ﬁlled with terror, and he took solemn oaths never
to reveal Anthemmina’s abode. ‘ The day that any one
through thee ﬁnds this peninsula,’ said Glandreth, ‘ that
day will be the last of thy life.’ Karadan knew not
that at the very hour when he brought Iarine thither,

Oloola was released from her vow to Glandreth, and free
to serve him whom. she had ever loved since ﬁrst she
saw him on the mountain's top.” “ And the silver
pitcher?” exclaimed Phantasmion. “That was stolen
from the hapless queen by Seshelma,” replied the Fairy,
“ and afterwards transferred to Karadan, who knew that
Iarine’s fate depended on it, and was beguiled by the
waterwitch to hope that she might in the end be his."
“ But O, where is it now ? ” the youth eagerly demanded.
Potentilla replied not, but pointed to thei coast of
the peninsula, where Dorna was joyfully hailing the
vessel. Phantasmion gained the shore, and, guided
by the aged woman, crossed the bleak waste which his
betrothed maiden had lately traversed; then, hurrying
through the cypress grove, he came in sight of the
marsh, just as the sun was throwing a red gleam over
that livid pool, in which, on the far horizon, he seemed
ready to sink and quench his ﬂaming tiara. When he
had passed the wood, Phantasmion stopped and beheld
Iarine kneeling beside her mother, who lay on the
margin of the lake, and seemed nigh unto death. Now
that life was waning, her senses had fully returned. .She
had recognised her sweet Iarine, and they had wept
together; could such tears have rained upon her blighted
cheek before they might have kept away a fatal malady.
“Dear child," she said, “thou wast a glimpse of soft
blue sky between the clouds of my tempestuous life.
N ow that it beams forth once again, my day is closed.”
Just as Anthemmina had spoken thus, and had begun
to lament over the wretched pass to which Iarine was
brought, she heard approaching footsteps, and, casting
up her death-stricken eyes, beheld Phantasmion. “Dori-

mant ! ” she faintly exclaimed; and Iarine, clasping her
hands, cried, “Yes ! the son of Dorimant! Phantasmion!
He is come to save and to protect us !” Then, while
the youth kneeled by her side, and told his tale, An-
themmina saw how she had been deceived by the watery
vision, and whom the ﬁgures there portrayed did truly
represent. She was glad to depart herself, and thankful
to ﬁnd that her child was destined for happiness, which
had ever been a mere vision to her. “But the silver
pitcher, given me by the guardian spirit of our race, that
is still wanting!” So thought Anthemmina when she
joined the hands ‘of the youthful pair, and blessed their
union. The mists of death had now begun to darken
her eyes, but, ere they were closed for ever, she caught
a glimpse of the charmed vessel, gleaming amid the
cypress trees, and just discerned a train of aerial ﬁgures,
which had glided thither from the sea, and were now
pausing in silence amid the shadows of the grove. Her
head then sank upon its earthy pillow, and, with a smile
on her countenance, the mother of Iarine expired. The
maiden closed her eyes, kissed her wan cheeks, and sank
in a swoon upon her bosom. Phantasmion goes to raise
her in his arms, but pauses on seeing another mourner
come to weep for Anthemmina. It is F eydeleen, the
Spirit of the Flowers; softly she rises from amid the
lilies of the pool, her head wrapped in a hood, white as
those lovely blossoms, while the ends of her shiny green
mantle ﬂoat away on either side of her bending form, .
and rest upon the surface of the water. » And now she
droops in sorrow over Anthemmina and the fainting
maid ; tears drop from her fair eyes on the faces of both,
and her yellow locks, light as gossamer, fall down and

mingle with the dark tresses of Anthemmina. At length
she raised her head, and throwing back the snowy hood
which had concealed her face, disclosed her bloomy
cheeks and golden tendrils to Phantasmion. Feydeleen
pointed to the silver pitcher, then to Iarine, and, softly
smiling, whispered, “ She is thine !” Hues of life were
drawing on the maiden’s cheek while Feydeleen retired
among the white and azure blossoms. She veiled her
head, and bowed it on the surface of the pool, as a
water-lily closes ' her cup and lowers her ﬂexile stem,
when the sun is on his downward path. In a few mo-
ments, none but the heads of the lilies glimmered on the
darkening waters of the marsh. ,
. As Feydeleen disappeared, Iarine rose from the earth,
supported in the arms of Phantasmion, and then the
train of sea-nymphs, with feet glancing in the twilight,
fair as foam that twinkles on the crest of a billow, poured
forward like a soft advancing tide. The foremost of
them brought the charmed vessel and placed it in the
maiden’s hand; they who came last bore the corse of
Karadan; they paused among the cypresses, and Iarine
held up the silver pitcher to hide the tears which ﬂooded
her drooping face. But ere those tears had ceased to
ﬂow, Phantasmion received it from the willing hand of
his gentle-hearted maid.
The nymphs now surrounded Anthemmina’s body,
taking the weedy coronals from their heads to scatter
them on that fair corse. Those who formed the outer
circle blew melancholy notes through many a wreathed
shell, attuning them to this farewell strain which their
sisters chanted :

Ah, where lie now those locks that lately st:-eam’d
’Mid gales that fann’d in vain that fevei-‘d cheek?
Low let them rest, ye winds,
The heart now rests in peace.
How vainly, while the tortur‘d bosom heav’d,
Restless as waves that lash’d her sea-beat haunt,
We strove to cool that cheek
Which death too quickly chill’dl
Like wreaths of mist, that some lone rock o’erhang,
And seem intent to melt the crags away,
While with soft veil they hide,
Its tempest-riven head ;
We hover’d round thee on the lonesome beach,
And sought to calm thy brow with dewy hand,
Thy wild unquiet eye
With pitying glances met.
“ O ﬂy with us,” we whisper-’d; “from glad hearts,
From mirthful bands that meet on moon-light shores,
We came to watch thee pace
This melancholy strand.
“ A captive thou, an exile here conﬁned;
But fatal passion to more galling chains,
To exile more unblest,
Thy blinded spirit dooms.
“O ﬂy with us; no dangerous choice we know,
Mild heavenly inﬂuence guides our gentle lives,
Obedient as yon tide,
Sway’d by the circling moon.

CHAPTER XLIV.
PHANTASMION AND IARINE ARE WAFTED TO THE NARROW
BAY, WHENCE THEY SAIL WITH ZELNETH AND
LEUCOIA TO ROCKLAND.
WHILE the procession moved along the wood with An—
themmina’s body, one of the many garlands that hung
about it fell to ‘the ground, which Iarine took up, and
fondly twined amid her own tresses. Phantasmion
observed the pomegranate wreath at a little distance
glittering on the borders of the marsh ; he went to fetch
the relic, and placed it in his bosom, resolving to keep
the memorial for his mother’s sake. In the stillness of
the air, as he stooped beside the pool, a mournful sound,
like the boom of some distant bittern, came to his ear
across the Waters. It was the voice of Seshelma; just
as Karadan expired, the witch was about to seize on
his corse and the pitcher along with it; but Oloola had
descended in a whirlwind, and, bearing her aloft, had
plunge.d her in that pestiferous bog which bounded the
Lost Land. Thence she dared not return into the sea,
but ever after continued slowly roaming from one part
of the fen to the other ; while her moans and wailings,
heard sometimes on the side of Tigridia, sometimes
toward the Land of Rocks, augmented the horror with
which the people of those countries regarded the marsh
and the peninsula beyond it.


## p. 340 (#366) ############################################

340 Phantasmion.
_The moon was up when Phantasmion and his fair
princess gained the beach, and espied Dorna sitting in
the vessel with the seeming pilot. They entered it,
and, when they had put out into the deep, no cloudlet
was ever driven along the sky by the keen winds of
March more swiftly than that skiff was made to ﬂy over
the ocean plain. After awhile, Phantasmion discerned
before the vessel’s prow a shadowy form which seemed
to be guiding it on its way. Iarine saw not what he
saw, for her eyes, from which the tears had scarcely
ceased to ﬂow, were now heavy with sleep, and at last
she lay in slumber on Phantasmion’s cloak upon the
open deck. Then the phantom rose up from the waves,
and turning about, revealed to him that still watched
the face of Zalia. While she murmured blessings on
his head, he pointed to the sleeping maid: “ O bless
her too,” he cried, “ who makes me blessed.” The shade
of Zalia bent toward Iarine, but soon recoiled, gazing
with a sad look on the blue lilies which now lay
withering on the damsel’s stainless brow. But when
Phantasmion removed Ainthemmina’s garland and placed
the jewelled wreath upon the maiden’s head, again the
face of Zalia grew softly bright, and, bending over
Iarine’s tearful cheek to breathe a benison, she seemed
like the moon shedding benign inﬂuence on some dewy
ﬂower.
When the stars faded in‘ heaven, Zalia, too, disap-
peared, but ﬁrst she pointed to a group of ﬁgures now
in sight upon the margin of the narrow bay, and sighing
said, “ Awake, Iarine ! thou hast fellow mourners ! Lo,
Zelneth and Leucoia weeping for their mother and for
Karadan ! ” With that voice sounding in her ear,


## p. 341 (#367) ############################################

P/zantasmzbn and Iarine sail to Rockland. 341
Iarine awoke : the shade of Zalia had vanished, but she
beheld the daughters of Magnart kneeling on the beach
beside two prostrate forms. Nigh them a fair shape
was pouring liquid on those lifeless bodies, but when
Iarine approached the mourners, it disappeared, leaving’
behind a fragrant atmosphere. Feydeleen had. been per-
forming the last kind ofﬁce for the mother and the son :
Arzene had watched and waited for Karadan in the bay
till those same sea nymphs who bore his pale corse to
the peninsula, transported it thence to her feet, then
falling senseless over it, she was drowned by the advanc-
ing tide. The same vessel in which the son of Magnart
sailed from these shores, received his embalmed body,
with that of his mother. Iarine, Zelneth, and Leucoia,
closely united in sorrow, entered the skiff with Phantas-
mion, and were driven by steady gales to the Rockland
coast, not far from the Diamanthine Palace.
Leaving the fellow mourners at that royal abode,
Phantasmion rejoined his kingly allies at the capital
city of Rockland, and learned that Glandreth's army
had submitted to their united forces without striking
another blow, so that the whole country was subdued.
Albinet with his mother Maudra had disappeared; for
no sooner was the fatal end of Glandreth generally
known, than the principal men of Rockland had revolted
against the widowed queen, declaring that they would
neither endure her sway nor that of her sickly child. To
escape their hands, she had ﬂed with young Albinet, no
one knew whither, and the chiefs placed their crown at
the disposal of the allied monarchs, signifying a desire
that he who should espouse the daughter of Albinian
might reign over them. Phantasmion was not eager to

embrace this proposal, but caused diligent search to be
made for Iarine’s brother, whose rights he resolved to ‘
uphold. At this time it was announced that mines
of iron, as well as of copper, had been discovered in
Gemmaura, and in a part of Palmland adjoining that
district.
While Ulander was restored to his ancestral throne,
the blooming Hermilian inherited Polyanthida. Mean-
time Penselimer and the sylvan chief found their fair
consorts at the Diamanthine Palace, and heard how, in
obedience to the voice of Feydeleen, they had followed
their mother to the narrow bay, where they found her
corse on the beach beside the body of Karadan. After-
wards Leucoia made known to Ulander that the witch's
Y cavern was destroyed on the night when the volcanic
mountain ﬁlled the heavens with smoke; and Zelneth
told her kingly spouse that the bleak waste around his
castle had begun to smile with verdure, while the black
cloud no longer rested on the horizon. “ It is reported,”
said she, “that the dim vale has been freed from its
diurnal canopy by the Spirit of the Blast, and that
Melledine has drowned herself in a mountain pool
which lies in deep shadow.”
Phantasmion caused the remains of Albinian to be
brought from Nemorosa under the care of the faithful
goatherd, and to be interred in Rockland with ﬁtting
pomp. Magnart’s body could never be certiﬁed among
the heaps of slain which had been defaced by the
trampling throng; but the obsequies of Arzene and
of Karadan were solemnly performed, and splendid
monuments were raised to their memory. Anthemmina
had no share in these funeral honours ; her relics could

not be entombed beneath a solid marble pile : but the
face of the deep, with its changeful hues and emotions,
for the mind of Iarine, was her mother’s monument, and
strains like these she dedicated to her memory :
Poor is the portrait that one look portrays,
It mocks the face on which we loved to gaze;
A thousand past expressions all combin’d,
The mind itself depictured by the mind,
That face contains which in the heart is shrin’d.
Yet, dearest mother, if on lasting brass
Thy very self to future times might pass,
Ill could I bear such monument to build
For future times with dearer memories ﬁlled;
Ah no ! thy fadeless portrait in my breast
From earth shall vanish when I sink to rest;
But, ere to join thee on glad wings I go,
Thy sun-like inﬂuence, beaming here below,
In sorrow’s hour, when earthly hope betrays me _
To heaven above, my hope’s best aim, shall raise me,
In hours of bliss when heaven almost seems here.
For thy sweet memory claim the tribute tear;
So yon bright orb doth tearful incense gain
From glittering lake, sweet rill, and humid plain,
Yet dries the spray that ‘trembled in the shower,
And shines reﬂected from each dripping ﬂower.

CHAPTER XLV.
IARINE FINDS HER BROTHERS IN THE GROVE WHERE
PHANTASMION FIRST SAW POTENTILLA.
WHEN the days of mourning had expired, all the
children of Magnart, with the kings who had espoused
Zelneth and Leucoia, accompanied Phantasmion and his
betrothed princess to Palmland, that they might be
present at their nuptials. The country palace where the
young monarch had always resided lay in their way,
being at no great distance from the conﬁnes of Rockland ;
and here it was resolved that the company should
sojourn, while preparations were made for the wedding
in the principal city. There was a strange look on
earth and sky when Iarine entered that regal domain, a
hot sun being veiled by bluish mist ; her cheeks glowed
and her breath laboured with the stiﬂed heat and with
eager anticipation, for she expected shortly to behold her
long lost infant brother. Eurelio was to be lord of
Gemmaura, so Phantasmion had declared; but how
could she rejoice over him without grieving for Albinet?
And alas ! where was Albinet to be found, or how could
she discharge toward that beloved boy her promise to his
father? With beating bosom she hastened onward, and
entered the grove where Potentilla ﬁrst showed herself
to Phantasmion. There she espied a child just old
enough to run alone, caressing a poor boy in tattered

clothes, and presenting him with fruits, toys, and frag-
ments of cake from a basket where all were mingled
together. Close by was a woman who wore a beggar’s
garb, and seemed in woeful plight; she sate upon the
ground, her head inclined against a tree, watching that
fair child and his pale comrade, who ate the dainties
given him by the rosy little one as if he were well
nigh famished. Her looks were full of misery, but not
a tear-drop glittered down her ghastly cheek. Iarine
knew at once that the younger child was Eurelio, and
ﬂew to embrace her darling charge, twice lost, and now
twice found. While she held him in her arms, the
sickly boy wept, and, catching her robe, exclaimed, “ O
' sister, wilt thou not speak to me ? art thou, too, turned
against me ? ” Startled by the sound of a well known
voice, the lady looked at him steadfastly, and saw that
he was her father’s heir, the poor rejected Albinet.
Then she gave Eurelio to his nurse, who had come up
in breathless haste, and tenderly caressed her weeping
brother, shedding tears herself while she wiped the big
drops which fell from his eyes.
But soon his face beamed with happiness, though wan
as frosted roses, and, turning to the wretched woman,
who vainly strove to rise, “Mother,” he cried, “our
griefs are ended now: here is Iarine. Sister, didst
thou ﬁnd that healing well? If thou hast any of the
water left, I pray thee give it to my mother.” By this
time the gentle princess had recognised Maudra’s altered
face, and, kneeling beside her, whispered words of con—
solation, declaring that she herself would be protected,
and Albinet restored to his rights, by the generous king
of Palmland. Tears now gushed in torrents from the

eyes of Maudra, but still she could make no reply ; her
evil counsellor, whom she had met on the sea-shore, after
the destruction of Glandreth, and frantically strove to
punish, had stricken a deadly chill into her frame and
rendered her speechless. And now Phantasmion was
seen holding up the charmed vessel among the boughs
of the pomegranate tree, which stood a little way back
within the grove. Potentilla sat in the shadow, while
Feydeleen, less hidden by the foliage, was pouring a
fragrant liquid from her chalice into the pitcher: and
just as Zelneth and Leucoia, with the rest of the com-
pany, arrived, he shed the ﬂower-spirit’s balmy gift on
the head of Albinet, whose body gradually changed as
the precious drops trickled over it, till by the time they
reached the ground he stood erect in blooming health
and vigour. His limbs, on which the ragged garments
had before hung loose, now muscular and shapely, ﬁlled
them out to their full stretch; his form was upright,
and his cheeks, though not so round and soft, were
blooming as those of Eurelio. Maudra had witnessed
the change with ﬂushed cheek and gleaming eye, but
could not utter a word of joy or thankfulness. Albinet
ﬂung his arms around her neck; “ O mother !” he said,
“ why art thou not healed of this dire malady?” But
Maudra scarcely thought of him or that ; for now again
her eye was fastened on Eurelio. Iarine observed that
look, and blamed herself that she had so long delayed to
V place the lost one in his mother’s arms. In haste she
brought him to her side, and gently whispered, "‘ This is
thy rescued babe, thy sweet Eurelio !” Joy lighted up
the face of the dying woman at these words ; she strove
to clasp the smiling child to ‘her bosom; but, ere she

reached him, her sight failed, and, sinking backwards,
she expired in the arms of Albinet.
A little while afterwards Phantasmion looked down
into the grove, and saw the heir of Rockland leaning
against a tree, with his weeping eyes iﬁxed upon the
ground. The Flower Spirit gleamed beside him in the
hazy light, and seemed to smile, as she bent forward, like
a sapling swayed by a gentle breeze, to crown his droop-
ing brow with thornless roses. Eurelio was too young
to weep the death of Maudra; he thought she slumbered
when silently and softly she was borne away. With
Potentillafs wand he struck a hollow trunk of sycamore,
'and sweetly his childish laughter rang through the
grove when myriads of bees came crowding forth, and
shone with all the_dyes of the opal, as they hung from a
branch above his head. Phantasmion felt as if he had
dreamed of years, not lived them; the fairy looked as
old and upright as when she ﬁrst appeared to him; the
trees around all seemed as green and ﬂourishing; the
grove was ﬁlled with just the same soft insect murmur,
and that bright swarm hung dazzling as of yore. .
' But lo ! the sun has broken through its hazy veil, and
Feydeleen's soft cheek, as if it faded in the brilliant light,
is seen no more among the blossoms; Albinet raises his
head, from which the airy chaplet melts away, and with
wonder-stricken eyes Eurelio gazes upward, for Potentilla
has risen from his side. A moment yet the wings of her
insect steeds are painted against the background of one
lingering cloudlet—but now they disappear, while earth
below, suffused with splendour, becomes a softened
image of the heavens themselves.
Phantasmion looked round in momentary dread, lest

Iarine should have proved a spirit and vanished like the
rest; but there she stood, her face beaming bright as
ever in full sunshine, the earnest that all he remembered
and all he hoped for was not to fade like a dream.

EXTRACTS FROM SOME PRESS NOTICES OF
MEMOIR AND LETTERS OE‘
SARA COLERIDGE.
EDITED BY HER DAUGHTER.
2 vols. crown 8vo. With 2 Portraits. Price 24s. Third Edition,
Revised and Corrected.
Saturday Review
“We could have wished to give specimens of her very just, subtle, and con-
cise criticisms on authors of every sort and time—-poets, moralists, historians,
and philosophers. We refer specially for samples of acute criticism in few
words to passing remarks on Dr Chalmers, Walter Savage Lander, and Sir
Arthur Helps. She warships Milton, the man as well as the poet, and is
unusually appreciative of Dryden. She has made an important contribution
to a subject already very rich, Wordsworth criticism. Sara Coleridge, as she
is revealed, or rather reveals herself, in the correspondence, makes a brilliant
addition to a brilliant family reputation."
Athenaeum.
“These charming volumes are attractive in two ways: ﬁrst, as a memorial
of a most amiable woman of high intellectual mark; and secondly, as rekind-
ling recollections, and adding a little to our information regarding the life of
Sara Coleridge's father, the poet and philosopher. We can scarcely conceive
an intelligent reader for whom these volumes will not have a charm, as
telling genuinely and naturally the life, the daily thoughts, and hopes, and
occupations, of a noble woman of a high order of mind, and as mirroring a
pure heart. Her letter writing is thoroughly unaﬁected. There is never
straining for affect. Abstruce subjects are treated without the least apparent
consciousness of learning, and without any studied ﬁne writing.”


## p. 350 (#376) ############################################

2 Extracts from some Press N otites of

B1ao1cwood'a Magazine.
“Her letters here published. have no nonsense whatever in them. She is
always at the same high level, always thinking, always communicating her
thoughts. The tone of her correspondence is marked by a consistent and
unvarying intellectual strain, a steady adherence to intellectual subjects,
ignoring all the common weaknesses of familiar writing, such as it would be
diﬁicult to equal. She writes so that men and angels may read, and
the whole world hear, and she never be ashamed. We promise the reader
that he will receive many ‘casual and transitory expressions ’ of a beautiful
and poetic nature from this book." ’
Spectator.
“ These volumes, containing extracts from the correspondence of Coleridge’s
only daughter, give the impression at once of one of the wisest and also one
of the most truly feminine natures that was ever possessed of great learning
and great powers of thought."
Westminster Review.
“Her letters are interesting as the expression of the feelings of a clever
woman, who lived in the really best society of the time. . . Readable from
beginning to end."
British Quarterly Review.
“ A very choice contribution to the literature of its class, not surpassed in
literary interest or intellectual power by any female correspondent that we
possess. It is, moreover, a valuable addition to the literature which has
gathered round the names of the Lake poets. . We commend the book
very earnestly."
Vanity Fair.
“Two most delightful volumes. In these published letters there is
much clever and acute criticism of things and people. It would be diﬁi-
cult in a few words to do justice to this work, but it is one which is a very
valuable addition to our recollections of eminent people."
London Society.
“One of the most beautiful books that we have seen for many years. A
portraiture of one of the clearest minds and heavenliest dispositions that have
ever blest our fallen orb. Her thoughts appear to go to the very heart of
things'; we have never read the language of clearer and more trenchant
criticism. We honestly recommend this work as one of the most interesting
and elevating that we have read for many e. long day."

Examiner.
“ An acceptable record, and present an adequate image of a mind of singular
beauty and no inconsiderable power.”
Hour.
“ We have read these two volumes with genuine gratiﬁcation.
Graphic.
“The memoir has only one fault, it is too short; but the real value of the
book lies in the letters, from which one can deduce the image of just such a
beautiful, loveable character as looks out upon us from the face of her portrait,
both in youth and in middle age.”
John Bull.
“ It is a book to study rather than to review. We can honestly say that we
never wearied of the perusal till the very last page was turned. A great
variety of subjects, of course, are discussed, and none which her graceful
touch has not adorned."
Guardian
“ These volumes enable us to follow intimately the course of a noble and
elevated Life. . . . The interest attaching to her name and memory, and
the mass of vigorous letters which she left behind, embodying her thoughts
and observations on art, literature, and religion, subjects on which her mind
habitually dwelt, fully justify the publication of these volumes.”
Morning Post.
“ The Editor has accomplished her task with much judgment and taste,
and with an amount of appreciative sympathy which none else could have
supplied, and she is quite satisﬁed in supposing that her book will afford
gratiﬁcation to a large and sympathetic circle of readers.”
Scotsman
“Whoever reads this brief life and her correspondence, will ﬁnd in Sara
Coleridge a character spiritually and morally pure and beautiful, and a mind
full of ﬁne and elevating activities."
