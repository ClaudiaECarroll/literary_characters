CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
A NOVEL.
CHAPTER I.
VISCOUNT IPSDEN, age twenty-five, income
eighteen thousand pounds per year, constitution
equine, was unhappy! This might surprise some
people: but there are certain blessings, the non-
possession of which makes more people discon-
tented than their possession renders happy.
Foremost among these are “Wealth and
Rank:” were I to add “Beauty" to the list, such
men and women as go by fact, not by conjecture,
would hardly contradict me.
The fortunate man is he who, born poor, or
nobody, works gradually up to wealth and con-
sideration, and having got them, dies before he
finds they were not worth so much trouble.

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Lord Ipsden started with nothing to win; and
naturally lived for amusement. Now nothing is
so sure to cease to please, as pleasure,—to amuse,
as amusement: unfortunately for himself he could
not at this period of his life, warm to politics;
so, having exhausted his London clique, he rolled
through the cities of Europe in his carriage, and
cruised its shores in his yacht. But he was not
happy!
. He was a man of taste, and sipped the arts
and other knowledge, as he sauntered Europe
round.
But he was not happy.
“What shall I do?” said l'ennuyé.
“Distinguish yourself,” said one.
“How?”
No immediate answer,
“Take a prima donna over,” said another.
Well, the man took a prima donna over,
which scolded its maid from the Alps to Dover
in the lingua Toscana without the bocca Romana,
and sang in London without applause; because,

what goes down at La Scala does not generally
go down at Il Teatro della Regina, Haymarket.
So, then my Lord strolled into Russia; there
he drove a pair of horses, one of whom put his
head down and did the work; the other pranced
and capricoled alongside, all unconscious of the
trace. He seemed happier than his working
brother; but the biped, whose career corresponded
with this playful animal's, was not happy!
At length an event occurred, that promised
to play an adagio upon Lord Ipsden's mind. He
fell in love with Lady Barbara Sinclair; and he
had no sooner done this than he felt, as we are
all apt to do on similar occasions, how wise a
thing he had done!
Besides a lovely person, Lady Barbara Sinclair
had a character that he saw would make him;
and in fact, Lady Barbara Sinclair was, to an
inexperienced eye, the exact opposite of Lord
Ipsden.
Her mental pulse was as plethoric as his was
languid.
She was as enthusiastic as he was cool.

She took a warm interest in everything.
She believed that Government is a science,
and one that goes with copia verborum.
She believed that, in England, Government
is administered, not by a set of men, whose
salaries range from eighty to five hundred pounds
a-year and whose names are never heard, but by
the First Lord of the Treasury, and other great
men.
Hence she inferred, that it matters very much
to all of us in whose hand is the rudder of that
state vessel, which goes down the wind of public
opinion, without veering a point, let who will be
at the helm.
She also cared very much who was the new
Bishop. Religion, or if not religion, theology,
would be effected thereby.
She was enthusiastic about poets; imagined
their verse to be some sort of clue to their char-
acters, and so on.
She had other theories, which will be in-
dicated by-and-by; at present it is enough to
say that her mind was young, healthy, somewhat

original, full of fire and faith, and empty of ex-
perience.
Lord Ipsden loved her! it was easy to love
her.
First, there was not, in the whole range of
her mind and body, one grain of affectation of
any sort.
She was always, in point of fact, under the
influence of some male mind or other, generally
some writer. What young woman is not, more
or less, a mirror? But she never imitated or
affected; she was always herself, by whomsoever
coloured.
Then she was beautiful and eloquent; much
too high-bred to put a restraint upon her natural
manner, she was often more naïve, and even
brusque than your would-be aristocrats dare to
be; but what a charming abruptness hers was.
I do not excel in descriptions, and yet I want
to give you some carnal idea of a certain
peculiarity and charm this lady possessed; permit
me to call a sister art to my aid.
There has lately stepped upon the French

stage a charming personage, whose manner is
quite free from the affectation that soils nearly
all French actresses, Mademoiselle Madeleine
Brohan! When you see this young lady play
Mademoiselle La Seglière, you see high-bred
sensibility personified, and you see something like
Lady Barbara Sinclair.
She was a connexion of Lord Ipsden's, but
they had not met for two years, when they en-
countered each other in Paris just before the
commencement of this “Dramatic Story,” “Novel”
by courtesy
The month he spent in Paris, near her, was
a bright month to Lord Ipsden. A bystander
would not have gathered, from his manner, that
he was warmly in love with this lady, but for all
that, his Lordship was gradually uncoiling him-
self, and gracefully, quietly, basking in the rays
of Barbara Sinclair.
He was also just beginning to take an in-
terest in subjects of the day-ministries, flat
paintings, controversial novels, Cromwell's spot-

less integrity, &c.,—why not? They interested
her.
Suddenly the lady and her family returned to
England. Lord Ipsden, who was going to Rome,
came to England instead.
She had not been five days in London, be-
fore she made her preparations to spend six
months in Perthshire.
This brought matters to a climax.
Lord Ipsden proposed in form.
Lady Barbara was surprised; she had not
viewed his graceful attentions in that light at all.
However, she answered by letter his proposal
which had been made by letter.
After a few of those courteous words a lady
always bestows on a gentleman who has offered
her the highest compliment any man has it in his
power to offer any woman, she came to the point
in the following characteristic manner:
“The man I marry must have two things,
virtues and vices—you have neither: you do no-
thing, and never will do anything but sketch and

hum tunes, and dance and dangle: forget this
folly the day after to-morrow, my dear Ipsden,
and if I may ask a favour of one to whom I
refuse that which would not be a kindness, be
still good friends with her who will always be
“Your affectionate Cousin,
“BARBARA SINCLAIR.”
Soon after this effusion she vanished into
Perthshire, leaving her cousin stunned by a blow
which she thought would be only a scratch to
one of his character.
Lord Ipsden relapsed into greater listlessness
than before he had cherished these crushed
hopes. The world now became really dark and
blank to him. He was too languid to go any-
where or do anything; a republican might have
compared the settled expression of his handsome,
hopeless face, with that of most day-labourers of
the same age, and moderated his envy of the
rich and titled.
At last he became so pale as well as languid,
that Mr. Saunders interfered.

Saunders vas a model valet and factotum;
who had been with his master ever since he left
Eton, and had made himself necessary to him in
their journeys.
The said Saunders was really an invaluable
servant, and with a world of obsequiousness,
contrived to have his own way on most occa-
sions. He had, I believe, only one great weak-
ness, that of imagining a beau-ideal of aris-
tocracy and then out-doing it in the person of
John Saunders.
Now this Saunders was human, and could
not be eight years with this young gentleman
and not take some little interest in him. He was
flunky, and took a great interest in him, as step-
ping-stone to his own greatness. So when he
saw him turning pale and thin, and reading one
letter fifty times, he speculated and inquired what
was the matter. He brought the intellect of Mr.
Saunders to bear on the question at the follow-
ing angle:
“Now, if I was a young lord with 20,000l.

a-year, and all the world at my feet, what would
make me in this way?”
“Why, the liver! Nothing else."
“And that is what is wrong with him, you
may depend."
This conclusion arrived at, Mr. Saunders
coolly wrote his convictions to Dr. Aberford, and
desired that gentleman's immediate attention to
the case. An hour or two later, he glided into
his lord's room, not without some secret trepida-
tion, no trace of which appeared on his face-
he pulled a long histrionic countenance. “My
Lord,” said he, in soft, melancholy tones, “your
Lordship’s melancholy state of health gives me
great anxiety; and with many apologies to your
Lordship, the Doctor is sent for, my Lord.”
“Why, Saunders, you are mad, there is
nothing the matter with me.”
“I beg your Lordship's pardon, your Lordship
is very ill, and Dr. Aberford sent for."
“You may go, Saunders.”
“Yes, my Lord. I couldn't help it; I've out-
stepped my duty, my Lord, but I could not

stand quiet and see your Lordship dying by
inches." Here Mr. S. put a cambric handkerchief
artistically to his eyes, and glided out, having
disarmed censure.
Lord Ipsden fell into a reverie.
“Is my mind or my body disordered? Dr.
Aberford! — absurd! — Saunders is getting too
pragmatical. The Doctor shall prescribe for him
instead of me; by Jove, that would serve him
right.” And my Lord faintly chuckled. “No!
this is what I am ill of,” — and he read the fatal
note again. "I do nothing! — cruel, unjust,"
sighed he. “I could have done, would have
done, anything to please her. Do nothing! no-
body does anything now—things don't come in
your way to be done as they used centuries ago,
or we should do them just the same; it is their
fault, not ours," argued his Lordship somewhat
confusedly; then leaning his brow upon the sofa
he wished to die: for, at that dark moment, life
seemed to this fortunate man an aching void; a
weary, stale, flat, unprofitable tale; a faded

flower; a ball-room after daylight has crept in,
and music, motion, and beauty are fled away.
“Dr. Aberford, my Lord.”
This announcement, made by Mr. Saunders,
checked his Lordship’s reverie.
“Insults everybody, does he not, Saunders ?”
“Yes, my Lord,” said Saunders, monoto-
nously.
"Perhaps he will me; that might amuse me,"
said the other.
A moment later the Doctor bowled into the
apartment, tugging at his gloves, as he ran.
• The contrast between him and our poor rich
friend is almost beyond human language.
Here lay on a sofa, Ipsden, one of the most
distinguished young gentlemen in Europe; a
creature incapable, by nature, of a rugged tone
or a coarse gesture; a being without the slightest
apparent pretension, but refined beyond the
wildest dream of dandies. To him, enter Aber-
ford, perspiring and shouting. He was one of
those globules of human quicksilver one sees now
and then, for two seconds; they are, in fact,

two globules; their head is one, invariably bald,
round, and glittering: the body is another in
activity and shape, totus teres atque rotundus;
and in fifty years they live five centuries. Horum
Rex Aberford—of these our Doctor was the chief.
He had hardly torn off one glove, and rolled as
far as the third flower from the door on his Lord-
ship’s carpet, before he shouted,
“This is my patient, lolloping in pursuit of
health. — Your hand,” added he. For he was at
the sofa long before his Lordship could glide
off it.
“Tongue. — Pulse is good. — Breathe in my
face."
“Breathe in your face, Sir! how can I do
that?" (with an air of mild doubt.)
“By first inhaling, and then exhaling in the
direction required, or how can I make acquaint-
ance with your bowels?”.
“My bowels!”
“The abdomen, and the greater and lesser
intestines. Well, never mind, I can get at them

another way; give your heart a slap, so.— That's
your liver.— And that's your diaphragm.”
His Lordship having found the required spot
(some people that I know could not) and slapped
it, the Aberford made a circular spring and
listened eagerly at his shoulder-blade; the result
of this scientific pantomime seemed to be satis-
factory, for he exclaimed, not to say bawled:
“Hallo! here is a Viscount as sound as a
roach! Now, young gentleman,” added he; “your
organs are superb, yet you are really out of sorts;
it follows you have the maladies of idle minds,
love, perhaps, among the rest; you blush, a
diagnostic of that disorder; make your mind
easy, cutaneous disorders, such as love, &c.,
shall never kill a patient of mine, with a stomach
like yours: so, now to cure you!” And away
went the spherical Doctor, with his hands behind
him, not up and down the room, but slanting
and tacking, like a knight on a chess-board. He
had not made many steps, before, turning his
upper globule, without affecting his lower, he

hurled back, in a cold business-like tone, the
following interrogatory:
“What are your vices?"
“Saunders,” inquired the patient, “which are
my vices?”
“M'Lord, Lordship hasn't any vices,” replied
Saunders, with dull matter-of-fact solemnity.
"Lady Barbara makes the same complaint,"
thought Lord Ipsden.
“It seems I have not any vices, Dr. Aberford,”
said he, demurely.
“That is bad; nothing to get hold of. What
interests you then?”
“I don't remember.”
“What amuses you?"
“I forget."
“What! no winning horse, to gallop away
your rents?”
“No, sir!”
“No Opera Girl, to run her foot and ancle
through your purse?"
“No, Sir! and I think their ancles are not
what they were."


## p. 22 (#26) ##############################################

22
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“Stuff! just the same, from their ancles up to
their ears, and down again to their morals; it is
your eyes that are sunk deeper into your head.
Hum! no horses, no vices, no dancers, no yacht;
you confound one's notions of nobility, and 1
ought to know them, for I have to patch them
all up a bit just before they go to the deuce.”
“But I have, Doctor Aberford.”
“What!”
“A yacht! and a clipper she is too."
“Ah!—(Now I've got him).”
“In the Bay of Biscay she lay half a point
nearer the wind than Lord Heavyjib.”
“Oh! bother Lord Heavyjib, and his Bay of
Biscay.”
“With all my heart, they have often bothered
me."
“Send her round to Granton pier, in the Firth
of Forth.”
"I will, Sir.”
“And write down this prescription.” And
away he walked again, thinking the prescription.
“Saunders," appealed his master.


## p. 23 (#27) ##############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“Saunders be hanged.”
“Sir!” said Saunders, with dignity, “I thank
you."
“Don't thank me, thank your own deserts,"
replied the modern Chesterfield. “Oblige me
by writing it yourself, my Lord, it is all the bodily
exercise you will have had to-day, no doubt."
“The young Viscount bowed, seated himself
at a desk, and wrote from dictation-
“DR. ABERFORD'S PRESCRIPTION."
“Make acquaintance with all the people of
low estate, who have time to be bothered with
you; learn their ways, their minds, and above
all, their troubles.”
“Won't all this bore me?” suggested the
writer.
“You will see. Relieve one fellow-creature
every day, and let Mr. Saunders book the cir-
cumstances.”
“I shall like this part,” said the patient, laying

down his pen. “How clever of you to think of
such things; may not I do two sometimes?"
“Certainly not; one pill per day,—Write, Fish
the herring! (that beats deer-stalking). Run your
nose into adventures at sea; live on ten-pence,
and earn it. Is it down?”
“Yes it is down, but Saunders would have
written it better."
"If he hadn't he ought to be hanged,” said
the Aberford, inspecting the work. “I'm off,
where's my hat? oh, there; where's my money?
oh, here. Now look here, follow my prescription,
and

neglect it, and—my gloves; oh, in my pocket-
you will be blasé, and ennuyé, and — (an English
participle, that means something as bad); God
bless you!"
And out he scuttled, glided after by Saun-
ders, for whom he opened and shut the street
door.
Never was a greater effect produced by a

doctor's visit: patient and physician were made
for each other. Dr. Aberford was the specific
for Lord Ipsden. He came to him like a shower
to a fainting strawberry.
Saunders, on his return, found his lord pacing
the apartment.
“Saunders,” said he, smartly; "send down to
Gravesend, and order the yacht to this place
what is it?"
“Granton pier. Yes, my Lord.”
“And, Saunders, take clothes, and books, and
violins, and telescopes, and things—and me—to
Euston Square, in an hour.”
“Impossible, my Lord,” cried Saunders, in
dismay. “And there is no train for hours."
His master replied with a hundred-pound
note, and a quiet, but wickedish look; and the
prince of gentlemen's gentlemen had all the re-
quired items with him, in a special train, within
the specified time, and away they flashed, north-
wards.

CHAPTER II.
It is said that opposite characters make a
union happiest; and perhaps Lord Ipsden, diffi-
dent of himself, felt the value to him of a creature
so different as Lady Barbara Sinclair; but the
lady, for her part, was not diffident of herself,
nor was she in search of her opposite; on the
contrary, she was waiting patiently to find just
such a man as she was, or fancied herself, a
woman.
Accustomed to measure men by their char-
acters alone, and to treat with sublime contempt
the accidents of birth and fortune, she had been
a little staggered by the assurance of this butterfly
that had proposed to settle upon her hand — for
life.
In a word, the beautiful writer of the fatal
note was honestly romantic, according to the
romance of 1848, and of good society; of course


## p. 27 (#31) ##############################################

27
she was not affected by hair tumbling back or
plastered down forwards, and a rolling eye went
no farther with her than a squinting one.
Her romance was stern, not sickly. She was
on the look-out for iron virtues; she had sworn
to be wooed with great deeds, or never won; on
this subject she had thought much, though not
enough to ask herself whether great deeds are
always to be got at, however disposed a lover
may be.
No matter; she kept herself in reserve for
some earnest man, who was not to come flattering
and fooling to her, but look another way and do
exploits.
She liked Lord Ipsden, her cousin once re-
moved, but despised him for being agreeable,
handsome, clever, and nobody.
She was also a little bitten with what she and
others called the Middle Ages, in fact with that
picture of them which Grub Street, imposing on
the simplicity of youth, had got up for sale
by arraying painted glass, gilt rags, and fancy,
against fact.

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE,
With these vague and sketchy notices we are
compelled to part, for the present, with Lady
Barbara: but it serves her right; she has gone to
establish her court in Perthshire, and left her
rejected lover on our hands.
Journeys of a few hundred miles are no longer
described.
You exchange a dead chair for a living chair,
Saunders puts in your hand a new tale like this;
you mourn the superstition of booksellers, which
still inflicts uncut leaves upon humanity, though
tailors do not send home coats with the sleeves
stitched up, nor chambermaids put travellers into
apple-pie beds as well as damp sheets. You
rend and read, and are at Edinburgh, fatigued
more or less, but not by the journey.
Lord Ipsden was, therefore, soon installed by
the Firth side, full of the Aberford.
The young nobleman not only venerated the
Doctor's sagacity, but half admired his brusquerie
and bustle; things of which he was himself never
guilty.
As for the prescription, that was a Delphic

Oracle. Worlds could not have tempted him to
deviate from a letter in it.
He waited with impatience for the yacht; and,
meantime, it struck him that the first part of the
prescription could be attacked at once.
It was the afternoon of the day succeeding
his arrival. The Fifeshire hills, seen across the
Firth from his windows, were beginning to take
their charming violet tinge, a light breeze ruffled
the blue water into a sparkling smile, the shore
was tranquil, and the sea full of noiseless life,
with the craft of all sizes gliding and dancing
and curtseying on their trackless roads.
The air was tepid, pure, and sweet as heaven;
this bright afternoon, nature had grudged nothing
that could give fresh life and hope to such
dwellers in dust and smoke and vice, as were
there, to look awhile on her clean face and drink
her honeyed breath.
This young gentleman was not insensible to
the beauty of the scene. He was a little lazy
by nature, and made lazier by the misfortune of
wealth, but he had sensibilities; he was an artist

of great natural talent; had he only been without
a penny, how he would have handled the brush!
And then he was a mighty sailor; if he had
sailed for biscuit a few years, how he would have
handled a ship!
As he was, he had the eye of a hawk for
Nature's beauties, and the sea always came back
of him like a friend after an absence.
This scene, then, curled round his heart a
little, and he felt the good physician was wiser
than the tribe that go by that name, and strive
to build health on the sandy foundation of drugs.
“Saunders! do you know what Dr. Aberford
means by the lower classes?"

“Are there any about here?”
“I am sorry to say they are everywhere, my
Lord.”
“Get me some”—(cigarette).
Out went Saunders, with his usual graceful
empressement, but an internal shrug of his
shoulders.
He was absent an hour and a half; he then

returned with a double expression on his face.
Pride at his success in diving to the very bottom
of Society, and contempt of what he had fished
up thence.
· He approached his Lord mysteriously, and
said, sotto voce, but impressively, “This is low
enough, my Lord.” Then glided back, and
ushered in, with polite disdain, two lovelier
women than he had ever opened a door to in
the whole course of his perfumed existence.
On their heads they wore caps of Dutch or
Flemish origin, with a broad lace border, stiffened
and arched over the forehead, about three inches
high, leaving the brow and cheeks unencumbered.
They had cotton jackets, bright red and yel-
low, mixed in patterns, confined at the waist by
the apron-strings, but bobtailed below the waist;
short woollen petticoats, with broad vertical
stripes, red and white, most vivid in colour;
white worsted stockings, and neat, though high-
quartered shoes. Under their jackets they wore
a thick spotted cotton handkerchief, about one

inch of which was visible round the lower part
of the throat.
Of their petticoats, the outer one was kilted,
or gathered up towards the front, and the second,
of the same colour, hung in the usual way.
Of these young women, one had an olive
complexion, with the red blood mantling under
it, and black hair, and glorious black eye-brows.
The other was fair, with a massive but shapely
throat, as white as milk; glossy brown hair, the
loose threads of which glittered like gold, and a
blue eye, which being contrasted with dark eye-
brows and lashes, took the luminous effect pecu-
liar to that rare beauty.
Their short petticoats revealed a neat ancle,
and a leg with a noble swell; for Nature, when
she is in earnest, builds beauty on the ideas of
ancient sculptors and poets, not of modern poetas-
ters, who with their airy-like sylphs and their
smoke-like verses, fight for want of flesh in wo-
man and want of fact in poetry as parallel beau-
ties.
They are, my lads.—Continuez!

These women had a grand corporeal treat;
they had never known a corset! so they were
straight as javelins; they could lift their hands
above their heads!-actually! Their supple per-
sons moved as Nature intended; every gesture
was ease, grace, and freedom.
What with their own radiance, and the snowy
cleanliness and brightness of their costume, they
came like meteors into the apartment.
Lord Ipsden, rising gently from his seat, with
the same quiet politeness with which he would
have received two princes of the blood, said,
“How do you do?” and smiled a welcome.
“Fine! hoow's yoursel?" answered the dark
lass, whose name was Jean Carnie, and whose
voice was not so sweet as her face.
“Whaťn lord are ye?” continued she. “Are
you a juke? I wad like fine to hae a crack wi' a
juke.”
Saunders, who knew himself the cause of this
question, replied, sotto voce, “His lordship is a
viscount.”

“I didna ken’t," was Jean's remark. “But it
has a bonny soond.”
“What mair would ye hae?" said the fair
beauty, whose name was Christie Johnstone. Then
appealing to his Lordship as the likeliest to know,
she added, “Nobeelity is just a soond itsel, I'mi
tauld.”
The Viscount finding himself expected to say
something on a topic he had not attended much
to, answered drily, “We must ask the republicans,
they are the people that give their minds to such
subjects.”
“And yon man," asked Jean Carnie; “is he a,
lord, too?
"I am his Lordship’s servant,” replied Saun-
ders, gravely, not without a secret misgiving
whether fate had been just.
“Na!" replied she, not to be imposed upon,
“Ye are statelier and prooder than this ane."
“I will explain," said his master, “Saunders
knows his value; a servant like Saunders is rarer
than an idle viscount.”
“My Lord, my Lord!” remonstrated Saunders,

with a shocked and most disclamatory tone.
“Rather!” was his inward reflection.
“ Jean,” said Christie, “ye hae muckle to
laern. Are ye for herrin’ the day, Vile Count?”
“No! are you for this sort of thing?”
At this, Saunders, with a world of empresse-
ment, offered the Carnie some cake that was on
the table.
She took a piece, instantly spat it out into
her hand, and with more energy than delicacy
flung it into the fire.
“Augh!” cried she, “just a sugar and saut
butter thegither; buy nae mair at yon shoep, Vile
Count.”
“Try this, out of Nature's shop,” laughed their
entertainer; and he offered them, himself, some
peaches and things.
“Hech! a medicine!” said Christie.
“Nature, my lad,” said Miss Carnie, making
her ivory teeth meet in their first nectarine, “I
didna ken whaur ye stoep, but ye beat the other
confectioners, that div ye.”

all this time as demurely as a cat cream, now ap-
proached him.
This young woman was the thinker; her voice
was also rich, full, and melodious, and her man-
ner very engaging; it was half advancing, half
retiring, not easy to resist, or to describe.
“Noo,” said she, with a very slight blush
stealing across her face, “ye maun let me cate-
cheeze ye, wull ye.”
The last two words were said in a way that
would have induced a bear to reveal his winter
residence.
He smiled assent. Saunders retired to the
door, and excluding every shade of curiosity
from his face, took an attitude, half majesty, half
obsequiousness.
Christie stood by Lord Ipsden, with one hand
on her hip (the knuckles downwards), but grace-
ful as Antinous, and began.
“Hoo muckle is the Queen greater than y
are.”
His Lordship was obliged to reflect.
“Let me see—as is the moon to a wax taper,

“An' whaur does the Juke* come in ?”
“On this particular occasion, the Duke ** makes
one of us, my pretty maid.”
“I see! Are na ye awfu' prood o' being a
Lorrd?”
“What an idea!”
“His Lordship did not go to bed a spining-
jenny, and rise up a lord, like some of them,”
put in Saunders.
“Saunders," said the Peer, doubtfully, “elo-
quence rather bores people.”
“Then I mustn't speak again, my Lord,” said
Saunders, respectfully.
“Noo,” said the fair inquisitor, “ye shall tell
me how ye came to be Lorrds, your faemily?”
“Saunders!”
“Na! ye mauna flee to Sandy for a thing, ye
are no a bairn, are ye?”.
Here was a dilemma, the Saunders prop

knocked rudely away, and obliged to think for
ourselves.
But Saunders would come to his distressed
master's assistance. He furtively conveyed to
him a plump book,—this was Saunders's manual
of faith; the author was Mr. Burke, not Edmund.
Lord Ipsden ran hastily over the page, closed
the book, and said, “Here is the story.”
“Five hundred years ago —".
“Listen, Jean," said Christie; "we're gaun to
get a boeny story. “Five hundre' years ago,""
added she, with interest and awe.
“Was a great battle,” resumed the narrator,
in cheerful tones, as one larking with history,–
“between a King of England and his rebels. He
was in the thick of the fight—"
“That's the King, Jean, he was in the thick
o't.”
“My ancestor killed a fellow who was sneak-
ing behind him, but the next moment a man-at-
arms prepared a thrust at his majesty, who had
his hands full with three assailants."

“Eh! that's no fair,” said Christie, “as sure as
deeth.”
“My ancestor dashed forward, and as the
King's sword passed through one of them, he
clove another to the waist with a blow.”
“Weel done! weel done!"
Lord Ipsden looked at the speaker, her eyes
were glittering, and her cheek flushing.
"Good Heavens!” thought he; "she believes
it!” So he began to take more pains with his
legend.
“But for the spearsman," continued he, “he
had nothing but his body; he gave it, it was his
duty, and received the death levelled at his
sovereign."
“Hech! puir mon.” And the glowing eyes
began to glisten.
“The battle flowed another way, and God gave
victory to the right; but the King came back
to look for him, for it was no common service.”
“Deed no!”
Here Lord Ipsden began to turn his eye in-
wards, and call up the scene. He lowered his voice.

“They found him lying on his back, looking
death in the face.
“The nobles, by the King's side, uncovered
as soon as he was found, for they were brave
men, too. There was a moment's silence; eyes
met eyes, and said, this is a stout soldier's last
battle.
“The King could not bid him live.”
“Na! lad, King Deeth has ower strong a
grip."
“But he did what Kings can do, he gave him
two blows with his royal sword.”
“Oh! the robber, and him a deeing mon.”
“Two words from his royal mouth, and he
and we were Barons of Ipsden and Hawthorn
Glen from that day to this.”
“But the puir dying creature?”
“What poor dying creature?”
“Your Forbear, lad.”
“I don't know why you call him poor, Ma-
dam; all the men of that day are dust; they are
the gold dust, who died with honour.
“He looked round, uneasily, for his son,-

for he had but one,—and when that son knelt,
unwounded, by him, he said, 'Good night, Baron
Ipsden;' and so he died, fire in his eye, a smile
on his lip, and honour on his name for ever.
I meant to tell you a lie, and I've told you the
truth.”
“Laddie,” said Christie, half admiringly, half
reproachfully, “ye gar the tear come in my
een. Hech! look at yon lassie! how could you
think t'eat plums through siccan a bonny story?”
“Hets," answered Jean, who had, in fact,
cleared the plate, “I aye listen best when my ain
mooth's stappit.”
“But see, now," pondered Christie, "twa
words fra a King,—thir titles are just breeth.”
“Of course," was the answer. “All titles are.
What is popularity? ask Aristides and Lamartine:
-the breath of a mob,—smells of its source,
and is gone before the sun can set on it. Now
the royal breath does smell of the Rose and
Crown, and stays by us from age to age.”
The story had warmed our marble acquaint-
ance. Saunders opened his eyes, and thought,

“We shall wake up the House of Lords some
evening,we shall.”
His Lordship then added, less warmly, look-
ing at the girls,
“I think I should like to be a fisherman.” So
saying, my Lord yawned slightly.
To this aspiration the young fishwives deigned
no attention, doubting, perhaps, its sincerity;
and Christie, with a shade of severity, inquired
of him how he came to be a Vile Count.
“A Baron's no' a Vile Count, I'm sure,” said
she; “sae tell me how ye came to be a Vile
Count.”
“Ah!” said he, “that is by no means a pretty
story, like the other; you will not like it I am
sure.”
“Ay, will 1,—ay, will I; I'm aye seeking
knoewledge,”
“Well, it is soon told. One of us sat twenty
years on one seat, in the same house, so one day
he got up a-Viscount.”
“Ower muckle pay for ower little wark.”

“Now don't say that, I wouldn't do it to be
Emperor of Russia.”
“Aweel, I hae gotten a heap out o- ye; sae
noow I'll gang, since ye are no for herrin’; come
away, Jean."
At this their host remonstrated, and inquired,
why bores are at one's service, night and day,
and bright people are always in a hurry; he was
informed, in reply. “Labour is the lot o'man.
Div ye no ken that muckle? And abune a'o'
women.” *
“Why, what can two such pretty creatures
have to do, except to be admired ?”
This question, coming within the dark beauty's
scope, she hastened to reply
“To sell our herrin'—we hae three hundre'
left in the creel.”
“What is the price?"
At this question, the poetry died out of
Christie Johnstone's face, she gave her companion
a rapid look, indiscernable by male eye, and
answered-
* A local idea, I suspect.-C. R.

“Three a penny, sirr; they are no plenty the
day,” added she, in smooth tones that carried
conviction.
(Little liar, they were selling six a penny
everywhere).
“Saunders, buy them all, and be ever so long
about it; count them, or some nonsense."
“He's daft! he's daft! Oh, ye ken Jean, an
Ennglishman and a lorrd, twa daft things the-
gither, he could na' miss the road. Coont them
lassie.”
“Come away, Sandy, till I coont them till
ye,” said Jean.
Saunders and Jean disappeared.
Business being out of sight, curiosity re-
vived.
“An' what brings ye here from London, if ye
please?" recommenced the fair inquisitor.
“You have a good countenance, there is
something in your face. I could find it in my
heart to tell you, but I should bore you."
“De'el a fear! (Bore me, bore me! whaat's
thaat, I wonder?)”

“What is your name, madam? Mine is
Ipsden.”
“They ca’ me Christie Johnstone."
“Well, Christie Johnstone, I am under the
doctor's hands."
"Puir lad. What's the trouble?” (solemnly
and tenderly).
“ Ennui!" (rather piteously).
“Yawn-we? I never heerd tell o't.”
“O you lucky girl,” burst out he; “but the
doctor has undertaken to cure me: in one
thing you could assist me, if I am not pre-
suming too far on our short acquaintance. I
am to relieve one poor, distressed person every
day—but I mustn't do two; is not that a bore?”
“Gie's your hand, gie's your hand. I'm
vexed for ca’ing you daft. Hech! what a saft
hand ye hae. Jean, I'm saying, come here, feel
this."
Jean, who had run in, took the Viscounts
hand from Christie.
"It never wroucht any,” explained Jean.

“And he has bonny hair?” said Christie, just
touching his locks on the other side.
“He's a bonny lad,” said Jean, inspecting
him scientifically, and point-blank.
“Ay, is he,” said the other. “Aweel, there's
Jess Rutherford, a widdy, wi' four bairns, ye
meicht do waur than ware your siller on her.”
“Five pounds to begin?” inquired his Lord-
ship.
“Five pund! Are ye made o siller? Ten
schell’n!”
Saunders was rung for, and produced a one-
pound note.
“The herrin is five and sax pence; it's four
and sax pence I'm awin ye,” said the young
fishwife, “and Jess will be a glad woman the
neicht.”
The settlement was effected, and away went
the two friends, saying,
“Good boye, Vile Count.”
Their host fell into thought.
“When have I talked so much?” asked he, of
himself.

“Dr. Aberford, you are a wonderful man; I
like your lower classes amazingly."
“Méfiez vous, Monsieur Ipsden!” should
some mentor have said.
As the devil puts into a beginner's hands,
ace, queen, five trumps, to give him a taste
for whist, so these lower classes have perhaps,
put forward one of their best cards to lead you
into a false estimate of the strength of their
hand.
Instead, however, of this, who should return
to disturb the equilibrium of truth, but this
Christina Johnstone. She came thoughtfully in,
and said,
“I've been taking a thoucht, and this is no
what yon gude physeecian meaned; ye are no
to iing your chaerity like a bane till a doeg;
ye'll gang yoursel to Jess Rutherford; Flucker
Johnstone, that's my brother, will convoy ye.”
“But how is your brother to know me?"
“How? Because I'll gie him a sair, sair
hiding, if he lets ye gang by." .

She then returned the one-pound note, a
fresh settlement was effected, and she left him.
At the door, she said, “And I am muckle
obleeged to ye for your story, and your good-
ness.”
Whilst uttering these words, she half kissed
her hand to him, with a lofty and disengaged
gesture, such as one might expect from a
queen, if queens did not wear stays; and was
gone.
When his Lordship, a few minutes after,
sauntered out for a stroll, the first object he
beheld was an exact human square, a hand-
some boy, with a body swelled out, apparently
to the size of a man's, with blue flannel, and
blue cloth above it, leaning against a wall, with
his hands in his pockets—a statuette of in-
souciance.
This marine puff-ball was Flucker Johnstone,
aged fourteen.

A slight moral distinction remains, not to be
so easily got over.
She was the best girl in the place, and he a
baddish boy.
He was, however, as sharp in his way as she
was intelligent in hers.
This youthful mariner allowed his Lordship
to pass him, and take twenty steps, but watched
him all the time, and compared him with a
description furnished him by his sister.
He then followed, and brought him to, as he
called it.
"I daur say it's you I'm to convoy to yon
auld faggitt!” said this baddish boy.
On they went, Flucker rolling and pitching
and yawing to keep up with the lordly galley,
for a fisherman's natural waddle is two miles an
hour.
At the very entrance of Newhaven, the new
pilot suddenly sung out “Starboard!”
Starboard it was, and they ascended a filthy

house.

CHAPTER III.
THE widow was weather-beaten and rough.
She sat mending an old net.
“The gentleman's welcome,” said she; but
there was no gratification in her tone, and but
little surprise.
His Lordship then explained that, under-
standing there were worthy people in distress,
he was in hopes he might be permitted to assist
them, and that she must blame a neighbour of
hers if he had broken in upon her too abruptly
with this object. He then, with a blush, hinted
at ten shillings, which he begged she would con-
sider as merely an instalment, until he could
learn the precise nature of her embarrassments,
and the best way of placing means at her dis-
posal.
The widow heard all this with a lack-lustre
mind.


## p. 52 (#56) ##############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
For many years her life had been unsuccess-
ful labour; if anything ever had come to her, it
had always been a misfortune; her incidents had
been thorns—her events, daggers.
She could not realise a human angel coming
to her relief, and she did not realise it, and she
worked away at her net.
At this Flucker, to whom his Lordship's
speech appeared monstrously weak and pointless,
drew nigh, and gave the Widow, in her ear, his
version, namely, his sister's embellished. It was
briefly this—“That the gentleman was a daft
lord from England, who had come with the bank
in his breeks, to remove poverty from Scotland,
beginning with her. "Sae speak loud aneuch,
and ye 'll no want siller,”” was his polite corol-
lary.
His Lordship rose, laid a card on a chair,
begged her to make use of him, et cetera; he
then, recalling the oracular prescription, said,
“Do me the favour to apply to me for any little
sum you have a use for, and in return I will
beg of you (if it does not bore you too much) to

make me acquainted with any little troubles
you may have encountered in the course of your
life.”
His Lordship, receiving no answer, was about
to go, after bowing to her, and smiling gracefully
upon her.
His hand was on the latch, when Jess Ruther-
ford burst into a passion of tears.
He turned with surprise.
“My troubles, laddie," cried she, trembling all
over. “The sun wad set, and rise, and set again,
ere I could tell ye a'the trouble I hae come
through.
“Oh! ye need na vex yourself for an auld
wife's tears; tears are a blessin', lad, I shall
assure ye. Mony's the time I hae prayed for
them, and could na hae them. Sit ye doon!
sit ye doon! I'll no let ye gang fra my door
till I hae thankit ye—but gie me time, gie me
time. I canna greet a' the days of the week.”
Flucker, ætat. 14, opened his eyes, unable to
connect ten shillings and tears.

Lord Ipsden sat down, and felt very sorry for
her.
And she cried at her ease.
If one touch of nature make the whole world
kin, methinks that sweet and wonderful thing,
sympathy, is not less powerful. What frozen
barriers, what ice of centuries, it can melt in a
moment.
His bare mention of her troubles had sur-
prised the widowed woman's heart, and now she
looked up, and examined his countenance; it was
soon done.
A woman, young or old, high or low, can
discern and appreciate sensibility in a man's face,
at a single glance.
What she saw there was enough. She was
sure of sympathy. She recalled her resolve,
and the tale of her sorrows burst from her, like
a flood.
Then the old fishwife told the young Viscount
how she had borne twelve children, and buried
six as bairns; how her man was always unlucky;
how a mast fell on him, and disabled him a

whole season; how they could but just keep the
pot boiling by the deep-sea fishing, and he was
not allowed to dredge for oysters, because his
father was not a Newhaven man. How, when
the herring-fishing came, to make all right, he
'never had another man's luck; how his boat's
crew would draw empty nets, and a boat along-
side him would be gunwale down in the water
with the fish. How, at last, one morning, the
20th day of November, his boat came in to
Newhaven Pier without him, and when he was
inquired for, his crew said, “He had stayed at
home, like a lazy loon, and not sailed with them
the night before.” How she was anxious, and
had all the public-houses searched, “For he took
a drop now and then, nae wonder, and him aye
in the weather.” Poor thing! when he was alive
she used to call him a drunken scoundrel to his
face. How, when the tide went down, a mad
wife, whose husband had been drowned twenty
years ago, pointed out something under the pier,
that the rest took for sea-weed floating-how it
was the hair of her man's head, washed about by

the water, and he was there, drowned without a
cry or a struggle, by his enormous boots, that
kept him in an upright position, though he was
dead; there he stood,-dead-drowned by slip-
ping from the slippery pier, close to his comrades”
hands, in a dark and gusty night; how her
daughter married, and was well to do, and
assisted her; how she fell into a rapid decline,
and died, a picture of health to inexperienced
eyes. How she, the mother, saw and knew, and
watched the treacherous advance of disease and
death; how others said gaily, “Her daughter was
better," and she was obliged to say “Yes.” How
she had worked, eighteen hours a-day, at making
nets; how, when she let out her nets to the other
men at the herring-fishing, they always cheated
her, because her man was gone. How she had
many times had to choose between begging her
meal and going to bed without it, but, thank
Heaven! she had always chosen the latter.
She told him of hunger, cold, and anguish.
As she spoke they became real things to him;

story-book. And as she spoke she rocked herself
from side to side.
Indeed, she was a woman “acquainted with
grief.” She might have said, “Here I and sorrow
sit! This is my throne, bid kings come and bow
to it!"
Her hearer felt this, and therefore this woman,
poor, old, and ugly, became sacred in his eye; it
was with a strange sort of respect that he tried to
console her.
He spoke to her in tones gentle and sweet as
the south wind on a summer evening.
“Madam,” said he, “let me be so happy as
to bring you some comfort. The sorrows of the
heart I cannot heal; they are for a mightier hand;
but a part of your distress appears to have been
positive need; that, we can at least dispose of,
and I entreat you to believe, that from this hour
want shall never enter that door again. Never!

cold, and you shall get to the Scotch fire, warmer
than any sun of Italy or Spain.
His Lordship had risen to go. The old wife
had seemed absorbed in her own grief; she now
dried her tears.
“Bide ye, Sirr," said she, “till I thank ye."
So she began to thank him, rather coldly and
stiffly.
“He says ye are a lord,” said she; “I dinna
ken, an' I dinna care; but ye're a gentleman, I
daur say, and a kind heart ye hae.”
Then she began to warm.
“And ye'll never be a grain the poorer for
the siller ye hae gien me; for he that giveth to
the poor lendeth to the Lord.”
Then she began to glow.

her ice by this time?) “Gude bless ye! and I
bless ye!”
And she did bless him; and what a blessing
it was;—not a melodious generality, like a stage
parent's, or papa's in a damsel's novel. It was
like the son of Barak on Zophim.
She blessed him, as one who had the power
and the right to bless or curse.
She stood on the high ground of her low
estate, and her afflictions—and demanded of their
Creator to bless the fellow-creature that had come
to her aid and consolation.
This woman had suffered to the limits of
endurance; yesterday she had said, “Surely the
Almighty does na see me a' these years!”
So now she blessed him, and her heart's blood
seemed to gush into words.
She blessed him by land and water.
She knew most mortal griefs; for she had felt
them.
She warned them away from him one by one.
She knew the joys of life; for she had felt
their want.

She summoned them one by one to his side.
“And a fair wind to your ship,” cried she;
“an' the storms aye ten miles to leeward o'her."
Many happy days, “an weel spent," she
wished him.
“His love should love him dearly, or a better
take her place."
“Health to his side by day; sleep to his
pillow by night.”
A thousand good wishes came, like a torrent
of fire, from her lips, with a power that eclipsed
his dreams of human eloquence; and then,
changing in a moment from the thunder of a
Pythoness to the tender music of some poetess
mother, she ended-
“An' oh, my boenny, boenny lad, may ye
be wi' the rich upon the airth a' your days—
and wi” the puir in the warld to come !"
His Lordship's tongue refused him the thin
phrases of society.
“Farewell for the present,” said he, and he
went quietly away.
He paced thoughtfully home.

He had drunk a fact with every sentence;
and an idea with every fact.
For the knowledge we have never realized
is not knowledge to us — only knowledge's
shadow.
With the banished Duke, he now began to
feel “we are not alone unhappy;" this universal
world contains other guess sorrows than yours,
Viscount - scilicet than unvarying health, un-
broken leisure, and incalculable income.
Then this woman's eloquence! bless me! he
had seen folk murmur politely in the Upper
House, and drone or hammer away at the
Speaker down below, with more heat than
warmth.
He had seen nine hundred wild beasts fed
with peppered tongue, in a menagerie called
L'Assemblée Nationale.
His ears had rung often enough, for that
matter.
This time his heart beat.
He had been in the principal Courts of
Europe: knew what a handful of gentlefolks

call “the World:” had experienced the ho-
neyed words of courtiers; the misty nothings of
diplomatists; and the innocent prattle of mighty
kings.
But hitherto he seemed to have undergone
gibberish and jargon:-
Gibberish and jargon—Political!
Gibberish and jargon-Social!
Gibberish and jargon—Theological!
Gibberish and jargon-Positive!
People had been prating-Jess had spoken.
But, it is to be observed, he was under the
double effect of eloquence and novelty; and, so
situated, we overrate things, you know.
That night he made a provision for this
poor woman, in case he should die before next
week.
“Who knows,” said he, “she is such an un-
lucky woman.”
Then he went to bed, and whether from the
widow's blessing, or the air of the place, he
slept like a ploughboy.

the Aberford problem—to relieve poor people,
one or two of whom, like the Rutherford, were
grateful, the rest acted it to the life—to receive
now and then a visit from Christina Johnstone,
who borrowed every mortal book in his house,
who sold him fish, invariably cheated him by the
indelible force of habit, and then remorsefully
undid the bargain, with a peevish entreaty that
"he would not be so green, for there was no
doing business with him,"—to be fastened upon
by Flucker, who, with admirable smoothness and
cunning, wormed himself into cabin-boy on board
the yacht, and man-at-alms ashore.
To cruise in search of adventures, and meet
nothing but disappointments; to acquire a
browner tint, a lighter step, and a jacket.
Our story moves for a while towards humbler
personages.

CHAPTER IV.
Jess RUTHERFORD, widow of Alexander John-
stone, for Newhaven wives, like great artists,
change their conditions without changing their
names, was known in the town only as a dour
wife, a sour old carline. Whose fault?
Do wooden faces and iron tongues tempt
sorrow to put out its snails' horns?
She hardly spoke to any one, or any one to
her, but four days after the visit we have de-
scribed, people began to bend looks of sympathy
on her, to step out of their way to give her a
kindly good-morrow; after a bit, fish and meal
used to be placed on her table by one neighbour
or another, when she was out: and so on. She
was at first behind-hand in responding to all
this, but, by degrees, she thawed to those who
were thawing to her. Next, Saunders called on
her, and showed her a settlement, made for her

benefit, on certain lands in Lanarkshire. She
was at ease for life.
The Almighty had seen her all these years.
But how came her neighbours to melt?
Because a nobleman had visited her.
Not exactly, dear novel-reader.
This was it.
That same night, by a bright fire lighting up
snowy walls, burnished copper, gleaming candle-
sticks, and a dinner-table floor, sat the mistress
of the house, Christie Johnstone, and her brother,
Flucker.
She with a book, he with his reflections
opposite her.
“Lassie, hae ye ony siller past ye?”
“Aye, lad; an' I mean to keep it!”
The baddish boy had registered a vow to
the contrary, and proceeded to bleed his flint
(for to do Christie justice the process was not
very dissimilar). Flucker had a versatile genius
for making money; he had made it in forty
different ways, by land and sea, ten pence at a
time.
Christie Johnstone.

“I hae gotten the life o' Jess Rutherford, till
ye,” said he.
“Giest then.”
“I'm seeking half-a-crown for't,” said he.
Now, he knew he should never get half-a-
crown, but he also knew that if he asked a
shilling, he should be beaten down to four
pence.
So half-a-crown was his first bode.
The enemy, with anger at her heart, called
up a humorous smile, and saying “an ye'll get
sax pence,” went about some household matter;
in reality, to let her proposal rankle in Flucker.
Flucker lighted his pipe slowly, as one who
would not do a sister the injustice to notice so
trivial a proposition.
He waited fresh overtures.
They did not come.
Christie resumed her book.
Then the baddish boy fixed his eye on the
fire, and said softly and thoughtfully to the fire,
“Hech, what a heap o' troubles yon woman has
come through.”


## p. 67 (#71) ##############################################

This stroke of art was not lost. Christie
looked up from her book; pretended he had
spoken to her, gave a fictitious yawn, and re-
newed the negociation with the air of one dis-
posed to kill time.
She was dying for the story.
Commerce was twice broken off, and renewed
by each power in turn.
At last the bargain was struck at fourteen
pence.
Then Flucker came out, the honest merchant.
He had listened intently with mercantile
views.
: He had the widow's sorrows all off pat.
He was not a bit affected himself, but by
pure memory he remembered where she had
been most agitated or overcome.
He gave it Christie, word for word, and even
threw in what dramatists call “the business,"
thus-
“Here ye suld greet"
“Here ye'll play your hand like a geraffe.”
“Geraffe? That's a beast, I'm thinking.”


## p. 68 (#72) ##############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“Na; it's the thing on the hill, that maks
signals.”
“Telegraph, ye fulish goloshen!”
“Oo ay, telegraph! Geraffe's sunest said
for a?"
Thus Jess Rutherford's life came into Christie
Johnstone's hands.
She told it to a knot of the natives next
day; it lost nothing, for she was a woman of
feeling, and by intuition an artist of the tongue.
She was the best raconteur in a place where
there are a hundred, male and female, who
attempt that art.
The next day she told it again, and then
inferior narrators got hold of it, and it soon
circulated through the town.
And this was the cause of the sudden sym-
pathy with Jess Rutherford.
As our prigs would say,
“Art had adopted her cause and adorned
her tale."

CHAPTER V.
THE fishing village of Newhaven is an unique
place; it is a colony that retains distinct features;
the people seldom intermarry with their Scotch
neighbours.
Some say the colony is Dutch, some Danish,
some Flemish. The character and cleanliness of
their female costume points rather to the latter.
Fish, like horse-flesh, corrupts the mind and
manners.
After a certain age, the Newhaven fishwife is
always a blackguard, and ugly; but among the
younger specimens, who have not traded too
much, or come into much contact with larger
towns, a charming modesty, or else slyness (such
as no man can distinguish from it, so it answers
every purpose), is to be found, combined with
rare grace and beauty.
It is a race of women that the northern sun
peachifies instead of rosewoodizing.


## p. 70 (#74) ##############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
On Sundays the majority sacrifice appearance
to fashion; these turn out rainbows of silk, satin,
and lace. In the week they were all grace, and
no stays; now they seem all stays and no grace.
They never look so ill as when they change their
“costume” for “dress.”
The men are smart fishermen, distinguished
from the other fishermen of the Firth chiefly by
their “dredging song."
This old song is money to them:—thus,
Dredging is practically very stiff rowing for
ten hours.
Now both the Newhaven men, and their rivals,
are agreed that this song lifts them through more
work than untuned fishermen can manage.
I have heard the song, and seen the work
done to it; and incline to think it helps the oar,
not only by keeping the time true, and the spirit
alive, but also by its favourable action on the
lungs. It is sung in a peculiar way: the sound
is, as it were, expelled from the chest in a sort of
musical ejaculations; and the like, we know, was
done by the ancient gymnasts; and is done by

70
French bakers, in lifting their enormous dough,
and by our paviours.
The song, in itself, does not contain above
seventy stock verses, but these perennial lines are
a nucleus, round which the men improvise the
topics of the day, giving, I know not for what
reason, the preference to such as verge upon in-
delicacy.
The men and women are musical and nar-
rative; three out of four can sing a song or tell a
story, and they omit few opportunities.
Males and females suck whiskey like milk,
and are quarrelsome in proportion: the men fight
(round handed), the women fleicht or scold, in
the form of a tea-pot,—the handle fixed and the
spout sawing the air.
A singular custom prevails here:
The maidens have only one sweetheart
a-piece!!!
So the whole town is in pairs.
The courting is all done on Saturday night,
by the lady's fire. It is hard to keep out of a
groove in which all the town is running; and

the Johnstone had possessed, as mere property-
a lad!
She was so wealthy that few of them could
pretend to aspire to her, so she selected for her
chattel a young man called Willy Liston; a youth
of an unhappy turn,-he contributed nothing to
hilarity, his face was a kill joy,—nobody liked
him; for this female reason, Christie distinguished
him.
He found a divine supper, every Saturday
night, in her house; he ate, and sighed! Christie
fed him, and laughed at him.
Flucker ditto.
As she neither fed nor laughed at any other
man, some twenty were bitterly jealous of Willy
Liston, and this gave the blighted youth a cheer-
ful moment or two.
But the bright alliance received a check some
months before our tale.
Christie was helluo librorum! and like others
who have that taste, and can only gratify it in
the interval of manual exercise, she read very
intensely in her hours of study. A book absorbed

her. She was like a leech on these occasions,
non missura cutem: even Jean Carnie, coadjutor
or “neebor," as they call it, found it best to keep
out of her way till the book was sucked.
One Saturday night Willy Liston's evil star
ordained that a gentleman of French origin and
Spanish dress, called Gil Blas, should be the
Johnstone's companion.
Willy Liston arrived.
Christie, who had bolted the door, told him
from the window, civilly enough, but decidedly
“She would excuse his company, that night."
“Vara weel,” said Willy, and departed.
Next Saturday-no Willy came.
Ditto the next. Willy was waiting the amende.
Christie forgot to make it.
One day she was passing the boats, Willy
beckoned her mysteriously; he led her to his
boat, which was called “The Christie Johnstone;">
by the boat's side was a paint pot and brush.
They had not supped together for five Satur-
days.
Ergo, Mr. Liston had painted out the four

first letters of “Christie," he now proceeded to
paint out the fifth, giving her to understand, that
if she allowed the whole name to go, a letter
every blank Saturday, her image would be
gradually, but effectually, obliterated from the
heart Listonian.
My reader has done, what Liston did not,
anticipate her answer. She recommended him,
whilst his hand was in, to paint out the entire
name, and with white paint and a smaller brush,
to substitute some other female appellation. So
saying, she tripped off.
Mr. Liston on this was guilty of the following
inconsistency; he pressed the paint carefully out
of the brush into the pot: having thus economized
his material, he hurled the pot which contained
his economy at “tie Johnstone,” he then ad-
journed to the “Peacock," and "away at once
with love and reason."
Thenceforth, when men asked who was Christie
Johnstone's lad, the answer used to be, “She's
seeking ane.” Quelle horreur!!

CHAPTER VI.
A LITTLE band of painters came into Edin-
burgh from a professional walk. Three were of
Edinburgh: Groove, aged fifty; Jones and Hyacinth,
young; the latter long-haired.
With them was a young Englishman, the
leader of the expedition-Charles Gatty.
His step was elastic, and his manner wonder-
fully animated, without loudness.
“A bright day,” said he. “The sun forgot
where he was, and shone; everything was in
favour of art.”
“Oh dear, no," replied old Grove, “not where
I was.”
“Why, what was the matter?”
“The flies kept buzzing and biting, and
sticking in the work: that's the worst of out o'
doors!”
“The flies! is that all? Swear the spiders in

special constables next time,” cried Gatty. “We
shall win the day;" and light shot into his
hazel eye.
“The world will not always put up with the
humbugs of the brush, who, to imitate nature,
turn their back on her. Paint an out o' door
scene in doors! I swear by the sun it's a lie! the
one stupid, impudent lie, that glitters amongst
the lies of vulgar art, like Satan amongst Belial,
Mammon, and all those beggars.
“Now look here; the barren outlines of a
scene must be looked at, to be done; hence the
sketching system slop-sellers of the Academy! but
the million delicacies of light, shade, and colour,
can be trusted to memory, can they?”
“It's a lie big enough to shake the earth out
of her course; if any part of the work could be
trusted to memory or imagination, it happens to
be the bare outlines, and they can't. The million
subtleties of light and colour; learn them by
heart, and say them off on canvass! the highest
angel in the sky must have his eye upon them,

and look devilish sharp, too, or he sha'n't paint
them: I give him Charles Gatty's word for that.”
“That's very eloquent, I call it,” said Jones.
“Yes," said poor old Grove, “the lad will
never make a painter.”
“Yes I shall, Grove; at least I hope so, but it
must be a long time first."
“I never knew a painter who could talk and
paint both,” explained Mr. Grove.
“Very well,” said Gatty. “Then I'll say but
one word more, and it is this. The artifice of
painting is old enough to die; it is time the art
was born. Whenever it does come into the world,
you will see no more dead corpses of trees,
grass, and water, robbed of their life, the sun-
light, and flung upon canvass in a studio, by the
light of a cigar, and a lie--and-_"
“How much do you expect for your picture?"
interrupted Jones.
“What has that to do with it? With these little
swords,” (waving his brush), “we'll fight for nature-
light, truth-light, and sun-light, against a world
in arms,—no, worse, in swaddling-clothes."

“With these little swerrds," replied poor old
Grove, “we shall cut our own throats if we go
against people's prejudices.”
The young artist laughed the old daubster a
merry defiance, and then separated from the
party, for his lodgings were down the street.
He had not left them long, before a most
musical voice was heard, crying,
“A caallerr owoo!"
And two young fishwives hove in sight.
The boys recognised one of them as Gatty's
sweetheart.
"Is he in love with her?" inquired Jones.
Hyacinth, the long-haired, undertook to reply.
“He loves her better than anything in the
world, except Art. Love and Art are two beauti-
ful things,” whined Hyacinth.
“She, too, is beautiful. I have done her,"
added he with a simper. -
“In oil?” asked Grove.
"In oil? no, in verse, here," and he took out
a paper.

“Then hadn't we better cut, you might pro-
pose reading them,” said poor old Grove.
“Have you any oysters?” inquired Jones of
the Carnie and the Johnstone, who were now
alongside.
“Plenty,” answered Jean. “Hae ye ony siller?”
The artists looked at one another, and didn't
all speak at once.
"I, madam,” said old Grove, insinuatingly, to
Christie, “am a friend of Mr. Gatty's: perhaps,
on that account, you would lend me an oyster or
two."
“Na,” said Jean, sternly.
“Hyacinth,” said Jones, sarcastically, “give
them your verses, perhaps that will soften them.”
Hyacinth gave his verses, descriptive of her-
self, to Christie.
This youngster was one of those who mind
other people's business.
Alienis studiis delectatus contempsit suum.
His destiny was to be a bad painter, so he
wanted to be an execrable poet.
All this morning he had been doggrelling,

when he ought to have been daubing; and now
he will have to sup off a coloured print, if he
sups at all.
Christie read, blushed, and put the verses in
her bosom.
“Come awa, Custy,” said Jean.
“Hets,” said Christie, “gie the puir lads
twarree oysters, what the waur will we be?”
So they opened oysters for them; and Hya-
cinth the long-haired looked down on the others
with sarcastico-benignant superiority. He had
conducted a sister art to the aid of his brother
brushes.
“The poet's empire, all our hearts allow;
But doggrel's power was never known till now."

CHAPTER VII.
At the commencement of last chapter, Charles
Gatty, artist, was going to usher in a new state
of things, true art, etc. Wales was to be painted
in Wales, not Poland-street.
He and five or six more youngsters were to
be in the foremost files of truth, and take the
world by storm.
This was at two o'clock; it is now five;
whereupon the posture of affairs, the prospects
of art, the face of the world, the nature of things,
are quite the reverse.
In the artist's room, on the floor, was a small
child, whose movements, and they were many,
were viewed with huge dissatisfaction by Charles
Gatty, Esq. This personage, pencil in hand, sat
slouching and morose, looking gloomily at his
intractable model.
Things were going on very badly; he had
been waiting two hours for an infantine pose, as
common as dirt, and the little viper would die first.

- Out of doors everything was nothing, for the
sun was obscured, and to all appearance ex-
tinguished for ever.
“Ah! Mr. Groove,” cried he, to that worthy,
who peeped in at that moment; "you are right,
it is better to plough away upon canvass blind-
fold, as our grandfathers--no, grandmothers, used,
than to kill ourselves, toiling after such coy ladies
as Nature and Truth.”
“A weel, I dinna ken, Sirr," replied Groove,
in smooth tones. “I did'na like to express my
warm approbation of you before the lads, for
fear of making them jealous.”.
“They be-no!"
“I ken what ye wad say, Sirr, an it wad hae
been a vara just an sprightly observaation. Aweel,
between oursels, I look upon ye as a young gen-
tleman of amazing talent and moedesty. Man,
ye dinna do yoursel justice; ye should be in th'
Academy-at the hede o't.”
“Mr. Groove, I am a poor fainting pilgrim
on the road, where stronger spirits have marched
erect before me.”


## p. 84 (#88) ##############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“A faintin pilgrim! Deil a frights o' ye, ye're
a brisk and bonny lad. Ah, Sirr, in my juvenile
days, we didna fash wi nature, an truth, an the
like."
“The like! What is like nature and truth,
except themselves?”
“Vara true, Sir; vara true, and sae I doot I
will never attain the height oprofeeciency ye
hae reached. An at this vara moment, Sir,” con-
tinued Groove, with delicious solemnity and
mystery, “ye see before ye, Sir, a man wha is in
maist dismal want-o' ten shellen!"-(A pause.)
_“If your superior talent has put ye in posses-
sion of that sum, ye would obleege me infinitely
by a temporary accommodaation, Mr. Gaattie.”
“Why did you not come to the point at
once?” cried Gatty, brusquely; "instead of hum-
bling me with undeserved praise. There.”—
Groove held out his hand, but made a wry face
when, instead of money, Gatty put a sketch into
his hand.
“There,” said Gatty, “that is a lie!"
“How can it be a lee?” said the other, with

85
sour inadvertence. “How can it be a lee, when
I hae na spoken?”
“You don't understand me. That sketch is
a libel on a poor cow and an unfortunate oak
tree. I did them at the Academy. They had
never done me any wrong, poor things; they suf-
fered unjustly. You take them to a shop, swear
they are a tree and a cow, and some fool, that
never really looked into a cow or a tree, will give
you ten shillings for them.”
“Are ye sure, lad?”
“I am sure. Mr. Groove, sir, if you cannot
sell a lie for ten shillings, you are not fit to live
in this world; where is the lie that will not sell
for ten shillings.”
“I shall think the better o' lees all my days;
sir, your words are inspeeriting.” And away went
Groove with the sketch.
Gatty reflected, and stopped him.
“On second thoughts, Groove, you must not
ask ten shillings; you must ask twenty pounds for
that rubbish."


## p. 86 (#90) ##############################################

86
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“Twenty pund! What for will I seek twenty
pund?”
· “Simply because people that would not give
you ten shillings for it will offer you eleven
pounds for it if you ask twenty pounds."
“The fules,” roared Groove. “Twenty pund!
hem!” He looked closer into it. “For a’,” said
he, “I begin to obsairve it is a work of great
merit. I'll seek twenty pund; an I'll no tak less
than fifteen schelln, at present.”
The visit of this routine painter did not cheer
our artist.
The small child got a coal, and pounded the
floor with it, like a machine incapable of fatigue.
So the wished-for pose seemed more remote than
ever.
The day waxed darker, instead of lighter;
Mr. Gatty's reflections took also a still more
sombre hue.
“Even nature spites us,” thought he, “because
we love her.”
“Then, cant, tradition, numbers, slang, and
money are against us; the least of these is singly

a match for truth; we shall die of despair or
paint cobwebs in Bedlam; and I am faint, weary
of a hopeless struggle; and one man's brush is
truer than mine, another's is bolder,-my hand
and eye are not in tune. Ah! no! I shall never,
never, never be a painter."
These last words broke audibly from him, as
his head went down almost to his knees.
A hand was placed on his shoulder, as a
flake of snow falls on the water. It was Christie
Johnstone, radiant, who had glided in unobserved.
"What's wrang wi ye, my lad?”
“The sun is gone to the devil, for one thing.”
“Hech! hech! ye'll no be long ahint him; div
ye no think shame.”
“And I want that little brute just to do so,
and he'd die first."
“Oh! ye villain, to ca' a bairn a brute; there's
but ae brute here, an it's no you, Jamie, nor me,
-is it my lamb?"
She then stepped to the window.
“It's clear to windward; in ten minutes ye'll
hae plenty sun. Tak your tools noo.” And at

the word she knelt on the floor, whipped out a
paper of sugar-plums, and said to him she had
christened “Jamie,"_“Heh! Here's sweeties till
ye.” Out went Jamie's arms, as if he had been
a machine, and she had pulled the right string.
“Ah, that will do,” said Gatty, and sketched
away.
Unfortunately Jamie was quickly arrested on
the way to immortality by his mother, who came
in, saying, -
“I maun hae my bairn,-he canna be aye
wasting his time here."
This sally awakened the satire that ever lies
ready in piscatory bosoms.
“Wasting his time! ye're no blate. Oh, ye'll
be for taking him to the college to laern pheesick,
-and teach maenners.”
“Ye needna begin on me," said the woman,
“I'm no match for Newhaven."
So saying she cut short the dispute by carry-
ing off the gristle of contention.
“Another enemy to art,” said Gatty, hurling
away his pencil.

The young fishwife inquired if there were any
more griefs: what she had heard had not accounted,
to her reason, for her companion's depression.
“Are ye sick, laddy?" said she.
“No, Christie, not sick, but quite, quite down
in the mouth.”
She scanned him thirty seconds.
“What had ye till your dinner?”
“I forget."
“A choep, likely?"
“I think it was.”
“Or maybe it was a steak?"
“I dare say it was a steak.”
“Taste my girdle cake, that I've brought
for ye.”
She gave him a piece; he ate it rapidly, and
looked gratefully at her.
“Noo, div ye no think shame to look me in
the face? Ye hae na dined ava." And she wore
an injured look.
“Sit ye there; it's ower late for dinner, but
ye'll get a cup tea: doon i' the mooth, nae

In a minute she placed a tea-tray, and ran
into the kitchen with a tea-pot. .
The next moment a yell was heard, and she
returned laughing, with another tea-pot.
“The wife had maskit her tea till hersel,"
said this lawless forager.
Tea and cake on the table—beauty seated by
his side—all in less than a minute.
He offered her a piece of cake.
“Na! I am no for any."
“Nor I then,” said he. :
“Hets! eat, I tell ye.” .
He replied by putting a bit to her heavenly
mouth.
“Ye're awfu’ opinionated," said she, with a
countenance that said nothing should induce her,
and eating it almost contemporaneously.
"Put plenty sugar," added she, referring to
the Chinese infusion; “mind, I hae a sweet tooth.”
“You have a sweet set,” said he, approaching
another morsel.
They showed themselves by way of smile, and
confirmed the accusation.

“Aha! lad,” answered she; "they've been the

“Now, what does that mean in English,
Christie?”.
“My grinders—(a full stop).
: “Which you approvem(a full stop).
“Have been fatal—(a full stop.)
“To many fishes!"
Christie prided herself on her English, which
she had culled from books.
Then he made her drink from the cup, and
was ostentatious in putting his lips to the same
part of the brim.
Then she left the table, and inspected all things.
She came to his drawers, opened one, and
was horror-struck.
There were coats and trousers, with their
limbs interchangeably intertwined, waistcoats,
shirts, and cigars, hurled into chaos.
She instantly took the drawer bodily out,
brought it, leaned it against the tea-table, pointed
silently into it, with an air of majestic reproach,
and awaited the result.

“Aweel! How do you do? that's English! I

Christie was now folding up and neatly ar-
ranging his clothes.
“Will you ever, ever be à painter?”
"I am a painter! I could paint the devil pea-
green!”
“Dinna speak o'yon lad, Chairles, it's no

“No! I am going to paint an angel; the
prettiest, cleverest girl in Scotland, "The Snow-
drop of the North.""
And he dashed into his bed-room to find a
canvass.

CHAPTER VIII.
GATTY's back was hardly turned when a
visitor arrived, and inquired, “Is Mr. Gatty at
home?”
“What's your will wi' him?" was the Scottish
reply.
“Will you give him this?”
“What est?"
“Are you fond of asking questions?” inquired
the man.
“Ay! and fules canna answer them," retorted
Christie.
The little document which the man in retir-
ing, left with Christie Johnstone, purported to
come from one Victoria, who seemed, at first
sight, disposed to show Charles Gatty civilities.
“Victoria—to Charles Gatty, greeting!” (salutem).
Christie was much struck with this instance of
royal affability; she read no farther, but began to
think, “Victoree! that's the Queen hersel. A letter

i the mairket—it will be an order to paint the
bairns. I hae brought him luck; I am real
pleased," and on Gatty's return, canvass in hand,
she whipped the document behind her, and said
archly, “I hae something for ye, a tecket fra a
leddy, ye'll no want siller fra this day.”
“Indeed!”
“Ay! indeed, fra a great leddy; its vara gude
o'me to gie ye it; heh! tak it.”
He did take it, looked stupefied, looked again,
sunk into a chair, and glared at it.
“Laddy!” said Christie.
“This is a new step on the downward path,”
said the poor painter.
"Is it no an order to paint the young
Prence?” said Christie, faintly.
“No!” almost shrieked the victim. “It's a
writ! I owe a lot of money."
“Oh, Chairles!"
“See! I borrowed sixty pounds six months
ago of a friend, so now I owe eighty!"
“All right!" giggled the unfriendly visitor at

the door, whose departure had been more or less
fictitious.
Christie, by an impulse, not justifiable, but
natural, drew her oyster-knife out, and this time
the man really went away..
"Hairtless mon!” cried she, “could he no do
his ain dirrty work, and no gar me gie the puir
lad th' action, and he likeit me sae weel!” and
she began to whimper..
“And love you more now," said he; “don't
you cry, dear, to add to my vexation.”
“Na! I'll no add to your vexation," and she
gulped down her tears.
“Besides, I have pictures painted worth two
hundred pounds; this is only for eighty. To be
sure you can't sell them for two hundred pence
when you want. So I shall go to jail, but they
won't keep me long.”
Then he took a turn, and began to fall into
the artistic, or true view of matters, which, indeed,
was never long absent from him.
: “Look here, Christie,” said he, “I am sick of
conventional assassins, humbugging models, with

look murder; they never murdered so much as a
tom-cat, I always go in for the real thing, and
here I shall find it."
“Dinna gang in there, lad, for ony favour."
“Then I shall find the accessories of a picture
I have in my head-chains with genuine rust,
and ancient mouldering stones, with the stains of
time.” His eye brightened at the prospect.
: “You among fiefs, and chains, and stanes!
Ye'll break my hairt, laddy, ye'll no be easy till
you break my hairt;” and this time the tears
would not be denied.
"I love you for crying; don't cry;" and he
fished from the chaotic drawer a cambric hand-
kerchief, with which he dried her tears as they
fell.
It is my firm belief she cried nearly twice as
much as she really wanted to; she contrived to
make the grief hers, the sympathy his. Suddenly
she stopped, and said,
“I'm daft; ye'll accept a lane o' the siller fra
me, will ye no?"

“No!” said he. “And where could you find
eighty pound?”
“Auchty pund," cried she, “it's no auchty
pund that will ding Christie Johnstone, laddy. I
hae boats and nets worth twa auchtys; and I hae
forty pund laid by; and I hae seven hundred
pund at London, but that I canna meddle. My
feyther lent it the King or the Queen, I dinna
justly mind; she pays me the interest twice the
year. Sae ye ken I could na be sae dirty as

a' my debtors that's hoenest, but never heed, ye'll
do gang to jail.”
“I'll hold my tongue, and sacrifice my pic-
tures,” thought Charles.
“Cheer up!” said Christie, mistaking the na-
ture of his thoughts, "for it did na come fra Vic-
toree hersel'. It wad smell o' the musk ye ken.
Na, it's just a wheen blackguards at London that
maks use o' her name to torment puir folk. Wad
she pairsecute a puir lad? No likely."
She then asked questions, some of which were

embarrassing. One thing he could never succeed
in making her understand, how, since it was sixty
pounds he borrowed, it could be eighty pounds
he owed.
Then once more she promised him her pro-
tection, bade him be of good cheer, and left
him.
At the door she turned, and said, “Chairles,
here's an auld wife seeking ye,” and vanished.
These two young people had fallen acquainted
at a Newhaven wedding. Christie, belonging to
no one, had danced with him all the night, they
had walked under the stars to cool themselves,
for dancing reels, with heart and soul, is not
quadrilling.
Then he had seen his beautiful partner in
Edinburgh, and made a sketch of her, which he
gave her; and by-and-by he used to run down to
Newhaven, and stroll up and down a certain
green lane near the town.
Next, on Sunday evenings, a long walk to-
gether, and then it came to visits at his place
now and then.

And here Raphael and Fornarina were in-
verted, our artist used to work, and Christie tell
him stories the while
And as her voice curled round his heart, he
used to smile and look, and lay inspired touches
on his subject.
And she, an artist of the tongue (without
knowing herself one), used to make him grave,
or gay, or sad, at will, and watch the effect of
her art upon his countenance; and a very pretty
art it is—the viva voce story-teller's—and a rare
one amongst the nations of Europe.
Christie had not learned it in a day; when
she began, she used to tell them, like the other
Newhaven people, with a noble impartiality of
detail, wearisome to the hearer.
But latterly she had learned to seize the salient
parts of a narrative; her voice had compass, and,
like all fine speakers, she travelled over a great
many notes in speaking; her low tones were
gorgeously rich, her upper tones full and sweet;
all this, and her beauty, made the hours she gave
him very sweet to our poor artist.

He was wont to bask in her music, and tell
her in return how he loved her, and how happy
they were both to be as soon as he had acquired
a name, for a name was wealth, he told her. And
although Christie Johnstone did not let him see
how much she took all this to heart and believed
it, it was as sweet music to her, as her own honey-
suckle breath to him.
She improved him.
He dropped cigars, and medical students, and
similar abominations.
Christie's cool, fresh breath, as she hung over
him while painting, suggested to him that smok-
ing might, peradventure, be a sin against nature
sa well as against cleanliness.
And he improved her; she learned from art to
look into nature (the usual process of mind).
She had noticed too little the flickering gold
of the leaves at evening, the purple hills, and the
shifting stories and glories of the sky; but now,
whatever she saw him try to imitate, she learned
to examine. She was a woman, and admired
sunset, etc., for this boy's sake, and her whole

heart expanded with a new sensation that softened
her manner to all the world, and brightened her
personal rays.
This charming picture of mutual affection had
hitherto been admired only by those who figured
in it.
But a visitor had now arrived on purpose to
inspect it, etc., attracted by report.
A friend had considerately informed Mrs. Gatty,
the artist's mother, and she had instantly started
from Newcastle.
This was the old lady Christie discovered on
the stairs.
Her sudden appearance took her son's breath
away.
No human event was less likely than that she
should be there, yet there she was.
After the first surprise and affectionate greet-
ings, a misgiving crossed him, "she must know
about the writ”-it was impossible; but our minds
are so constituted—when we are guilty, we fear
that others know what we know.
Now Gatty was particularly anxious she

should not know about this writ, for he had in-
curred the debt by acting against her advice.
Last year he commenced a picture in which
was Durham Cathedral; his mother bade him stay
quietly at home, and paint the cathedral and its
banks from a print, “as any other painter would,”
observed she.
But this was not the lad's system; he spent
five months on the spot, and painted his picture,
but he had to borrow sixty pounds to do this;
the condition of this loan was, that in six months
he should either pay eighty pounds, or finish,
and hand over, a certain half-finished picture.
He did neither; his new subject thrust aside
his old one, and he had no money, ergo his
friend, a picture-dealer, who had found artists
slippery in money matters, followed him up sharp,
as we see.
“There is nothing the matter, I hope, mother.
What is it?"
“I'm tired, Charles.” He brought her a seat:
she sat down.
“I did not come from Newcastle at my age,

for nothing; you have formed an improper ac-
quaintance.”
“I, who? Is it Jack Adams?”
“Worse than any Jack Adams!”
“Who can that be? Jenkyns, mother, because
he does the same things as Jack, and pretends to
be religious."
“It is a female—a fishwife. Oh, my son!"
“Christie Johnstone an improper acquaint-
ance," said he, “why! I was good for nothing
till I knew her; she has made me so good, mother;
so steady, so industrious; you will never have to
find fault with me again.”
“Nonsense:--a woman that sells fish in the
streets!”
“But you have not seen her. She is beautiful,
her mind is not in fish; her mind grasps the
beautiful and the good-she is a companion for
princes! What am I that she wastes a thought
or a ray of music on me? Heaven bless her.
She reads our best authors, and never forgets a
word; and she tells me beautiful stories-some-

times they make me cry, for her voice is a music
that goes straight to my heart.”
"A woman that does not even wear the clothes
of a lady."
“It is the only genuine costume in these is-
lands not beneath a painter's notice."
“Look at me, Charles? at your mother."
“Yes, mother,” said he, nervously.
“You must part with her, or kill me."
He started from his seat and began to flutter
up and down the room; poor excitable creature.
“Part with her," cried he, “I shall never be a
painter if I do; what is to keep my heart warm
when the sun is hid, when the birds are silent,
when difficulty looks a mountain, and success a
mole-hill? What is an artist without love? How
is he to bear up against his disappointments from
within, his mortification from without? the great
ideas he has and cannot grasp, and all the forms
of ignorance that sting him, from stupid insen-
sibility down to clever, shallow criticism?"
“Come back to common sense,” said the old
lady, coldly and grimly.


## p. 105 (#109) ############################################

He looked uneasy: common sense had often
been quoted against him, and common sense had
always proved right.
“Come back to common sense. She shall
not be your mistress, and she cannot bear your
name; you must part some day, because you
cannot come together, and now is the best time.”
“Not be together? all our lives, all our lives,
ay," cried he, rising into enthusiasm, "hundreds
of years to come will we two be together before
men's eyes — I will be an immortal painter, that
the world and time may cherish the features I
have loved. I love her, mother," added he, with
a tearful tenderness that ought to have reached
a woman's heart; then Aushing, trembling, and
inspired he burst out, “And I wish I was a
sculptor and a poet too, that Christie might live
in stone and verse, as well as colours, and all
who love an art might say, “This woman cannot
die, Charles Gatty loved her.'”
He looked in her face; he could not believe
any creature could be insensible to his love, and
persist to rob him of it.

The old woman paused, to let his eloquence
evaporate.
The pause chilled him; then gently and
slowly, but emphatically, she spoke to him thus-
“Who has kept you on her small means ever
since you were ten years and seven months old?”
“You should know, mother, dear mother.”
“Answer me, Charles.”
“My mother.”
“Who has pinched herself, in every earthly
thing, to make you an immortal painter, and,
above all, a gentleman?"
“My mother."
“Who forgave you the little faults of youth,
before you could ask pardon?”
“My mother! Oh, mother, I ask pardon now
for all the trouble I ever gave the best, the
dearest, the tenderest of mothers.”
“Who will go home to Newcastle, a broken-
hearted woman, with the one hope gone that has
kept her up in poverty and sorrow so many
weary years, if this goes on?"
“Nobody, I hope."

“Yes, Charles; your mother.”
“Oh, mother; you have been always my best
friend."
“And am this day."
“Do not be my worst enemy now: it is for
me to obey you; but it is for you to think well
before you drive me to despair.”
And the poor womanish heart leaned his
head on the table, and began to sorrow over his
hard fate.
Mrs. Gatty soothed him. “It need not be
done all in a moment — it must be done kindly,
but firmly. I will give you as much time as you like.”
This bait took — the weak love to temporize.
It is doubtful whether he honestly intended
to part with Christie Johnstone, but to pacify his
mother, he promised to begin and gradually untie
the knot.
“My mother will go," whispered his deceit-
ful heart, “and when she is away, perhaps I shall
find out that in spite of every effort I cannot
resign my treasure."
He gave a sort of half-promise for the sake
of peace.

His mother instantly sent to the inn for her
boxes.
“There is a room in this same house," said
she, “I will take it; I will not hurry you, but
until it is done, I stay here — if it is a twelve-
month about."
He turned pale.
“And now hear the good news I have brought
you from Newcastle.”
Oh! these little iron wills, how is a great
artist to fight three hundred and sixty-five days
against such an antagonist.
Every day saw a repetition of these dialogues,
in which genius made gallant bursts into the air,
and strong, hard sense, caught him on his
descent, and dabbed glue on his gauzy wings.
Old age and youth see life so differently.
To youth it is a story-book, in which we are
to command the incidents, and be the bright
exceptions to one rule after another.
To age it is an almanack, in which everything
will happen just as it has happened so many times.
To youth, it is a path through a sunny
meadow.

To age, a hard turnpike:
Whose travellers must be all sweat and dust,
when they are not in mud and drenched:
Which wants mending in many places, and is
mended with sharp stones.
Gatty would not yield to go down to New-
haven, and take a step against his love, but he
yielded so far as to remain passive, and see
whether this creature was necessary to his
existence or not.
Mrs. G. scouted the idea.
“He was to work, and he would soon forget her.”
Poor boy, he wanted to work; his debt
weighed on him; a week's resolute labour might
finish his first picture and satisfy his creditor.
The subject was an interior. He set to work, he
stuck to work, he glued to work, his body - but
his heart?
Ah, my poor fellow, a much slower horse
than Gatty will go by you, ridden as you are by
a leaden heart.

He was unhappy. He heard only one side
for days, that side was recommended by his duty,
filial affection, and diffidence of his own good sense
He was brought to see his proceedings were
eccentric, and that it is destruction to be eccentric.
He was made a little ashamed of what he had
been proud of.
He was confused and perplexed; he hardly
knew what to think or do; he collapsed, and all
his spirit was fast leaving him, and then he felt
inclined to lean on the first thing he could find,
and nothing came to hand but his mother.
Meantime, Christie Johnstone was also think-
ing of him, but her single anxiety was to find
this eighty pounds for him.
It is a Newhaven idea that the female is the
natural protector of the male, and this idea was
strengthened in her case.
She did not fully comprehend his character
and temperament, but she saw, by instinct, that
she was to be the protector.
Besides, as she was twenty-one, and he only
twenty-two, she felt the difference between herself
-a woman, and him-a boy, and to leave him

to struggle unaided out of his difficulties, seemed
to her heartless.
Twice she opened her lips to engage the
charitable “Vile Count” in his cause, but shame
closed them again; this would be asking a
personal favour, and one on so large a scale.
Several days passed thus; she had determined
not to visit him without good news.
She then began to be surprised, she heard
nothing from him.
And now she felt something that prevented
her calling on him.
But Jean Carnie was to be married, and the
next day the wedding party were to spend in
festivity upon the island of Inch Coombe.
She bade Jean call on him, and without
mentioning her, invite him to this party, from
which, he must know, she would not be absent.
Jean Carnie entered his apartment, and at her
entrance, his mother, who took for granted this
was his sweetheart, whispered in his ear that he
should now take the first step, and left him.
What passed between Jean Carnie and Charles
Gatty, is for another chapter.

A YOUNG Viscount with income and person

First one discovers him, then another, then
twenty, then all the world, as the whole clique is
modestly called.
Before, however, Lord Ipsden was caught, he
had acquired a browner tint, a more elastic step,
and a stouter heart.
The Aberford prescription had done wonders
for him.
He caught himself passing one whole day
without thinking of Lady Barbara Sinclair.
But even Aberford had misled him; there
were no adventures to be found in the Firth of
Forth; most of the days there was no wind to
speak of; twice it blew great guns, and the men
were surprised at his Lordship going out, but
nobody was in any. danger except himself; the

fishermen had all slipped into port before matters
were serious.
He found the merchantmen that could sail
creeping on with three reefs in their mainsail;
and the Dutchmen lying to and breasting it, like
ducks in a pond, and with no more chance of
harm.
On one of these occasions he did observe a
little steam-tug, going about a knot an hour, and
rolling like a washing-tub. He ran down to her, and
asked if he could assist her; she answered through
the medium of a sooty animal at her helm, that
she was (like our universities) “satisfied with her
own progress;” she added, being under intoxica-
tion, "That if any danger existed, her scheme was
to drown it in the bo-o-owl;” and two days
afterwards, he saw her puffing and panting, and
fiercely dragging a gigantic three-decker out into
deep water, like an industrious flea pulling his
phaeton.
And now it is my office to relate how Mr.
Flucker Johnstone comported himself on one
occasion.
Christie Johnstone.


## p. 114 (#118) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
As the yacht worked alongside Granton Pier,
before running out, the said Flucker, calmly and
scientifically, drew his Lordship's attention to
three points:
The direction of the wind — the force of the
wind—and his opinion, as a person experienced
in the Firth, that it was going to be worse in-
stead of better; in reply, he received an order to
step forward to his place in the cutter—the im-
mediate vicinity of the jibboom. On this Mr.
Flucker instantly burst into tears.
His Lordship, or as Flucker called him, ever
since the yacht came down, “the Skipper," deem-
ing that the higher appellation, inquired with
some surprise, what was the matter with the
boy?
One of the crew, who, by-the-by, squinted,
suggested “it was a slight illustration of the pas-
sion of fear.”
Flucker confirmed the theory, by gulping out,
“We'll never see Newhaven again.”
On this the Skipper smiled, and ordered him
ashore, somewhat peremptorily.

Straightway he began to howl, and saying “it
was better to be drowned than be the laughing-
stock of the place,” went forward to his place;
on his safe return to port, this young gentleman
was very severe on open boats, which he said
“bred womanish notions in hearts naturally
dauntless.—Give me a lid to the pot," added he,
"and I'll sail with Old Nick, let the wind blow
high or low.”
The Aberford was wrong when he called love
a cutaneous disorder.
There are cutaneous disorders that take that
name, but they are no more love than verse is poetry;
Than patriotism is love of country;
Than theology is religion;
Than science is philosophy;
Than paintings are pictures;
Than reciting on the boards is acting;
Than physic is medicine;
Than bread is bread, or gold, gold-in shops.
Love is a state of being; the beloved object
is our centre; and our thoughts, affections,
schemes, and selves, move but round it.

We may diverge hither or thither, but the
golden thread still holds us.
Is fair or dark beauty the fairest? The world
cannot decide; but love shall decide in a moment.
A halo surrounds her we love, and makes
beautiful to us her movements, her looks, her
virtues, her faults, her nonsense, her affectation,
and herself, and that's love, Doctor!
Lord Ipsden was capable of loving like this;
but to do Lady Barbara justice, she had done
much to freeze the germ of noble passion; she
had not killed, but she had benumbed it.
“Saunders," said Lord Ipsden, one morning
after breakfast, “have you entered everything in
your diary?"
“Yes, my Lord.”
“All these good people's misfortunes?"
“Yes, my Lord.”
“Do you think you have spelt their names
right?”
“Where it was impossible, my Lord, I sub-
stituted an English appellation identical in
meaning."

“Have you entered and described my first
interview with Christie Johnstone, and somebody
something?"
“Most minutely, my Lord.”
“How I turned Mr. Burke into poetry-how
she listened with her eyes all glistening-how
they made me talk - how she dropped a tear,
he! he! he! at the death of the first baron-how
shocked she was at the king striking him when
he was dying, to make a knight-banneret of the
poor old fellow?"
“Your Lordship will find all the particulars
exactly related,” said Saunders, with dry pomp.
“How she found out that titles are but breath
-how I answered-some nonsense?”
“Your Lordship will find all the topics in-
cluded.”
“How she took me for a madman?
“And you for a prig?”
“The latter circumstance eluded my memory,
my Lord.”
“But when I told her I must relieve only one
poor person by day, she took my hand.”

“Your Lordship will find all the items realized
in this book, my Lord.”
“What a beautiful book!"
“Alba are considerably ameliorated, my Lord?”
“Alba?”
“Plural of album, my Lord,” explained the
refined factotum, “more delicate, I conceive, than
the vulgar reading.”
Viscount Ipsden read from
“MR. SAUNDERS'S ALBUM.
“To illustrate the inelegance of the inferior
classes, two juvenile vendors of the piscatory
tribes were this day ushered in, and instan-
taneously, without the accustomed preliminaries,
plunged into a familiar conversation with Lord
Viscount Ipsden.
“Their vulgarity, shocking and repulsive to
myself, appeared to afford his Lordship a satis-
faction greater than he derives from the graceful
amenities of fashionable association,”
“Saunders, I suspect you of something."

“Me, my Lord!”
“Yes. Writing in an Annual.”
“I do, my Lord,” said he with benignant
hauteur, “It appears every month—“The Poly-
technic.'"
“I thought so! you are polysyllabic, Saun-
ders; en route!"
“In this hallucination I find it difficult to
participate; associated from infancy with the
aristocracy, I shrink, like the sensitive plant, from
contact with anything vulgar.”
“I see! I begin to understand you, Saun-
ders. Order the dog-cart, and Wordsworth's
mare for leader, we'll give her a trial. You are
an ass, Saunders.”
“Yes, my Lord; I will order Robert to tell
James to come for your Lordship's commands
about your Lordship’s vehicles. (What could he
intend by a recent observation of a discourteous
character?")
His Lordship soliloquized.

“I never observed it before, but Saunders is
an ass! La Johnstone is one of Nature's
duchesses, and she has made me know some
poor people that will be richer than the rich
one day; and she has taught me that honey is
to be got from bank notes—by merely giving
them away.”
Amongst the objects of charity Lord Ipsden
discovered, was one Thomas Harvey, a maker
and player of the violin. This man was a
person of great intellect; he mastered every
subject he attacked. By a careful examination
of all the points that various fine-toned instru-
ments had in common, he had arrived at a
theory of sound; he made violins to correspond,
and was remarkably successful in insuring that
which had been too hastily ascribed to accident,
a fine tone.
This man, who was in needy circumstances,
demonstrated to his Lordship that ten pounds
would make his fortune; because with ten
pounds he could set up a shop instead of
working out of the world's sight, in a room.

Lord Ipsden gave him ten pounds!
A week after, he met Harvey, more ragged
and dirty than before.
Harvey had been robbed by a friend whom
he had assisted. Poor Harvey! Lord Ipsden
gave him ten pounds more!
Next week, Saunders entering Harvey's house,
found him in bed at noon, because he had no
clothes to wear. .
Saunders suggested that it would be better
to give his wife the next money, with strict
orders to apply it usefully.
This was done!
The next day, Harvey finding his clothes
upon a chair, his tools redeemed from pawn,
and a beef-steak ready for his dinner, accused
his wife of having money, and meanly refusing
him the benefit of it. She acknowledged she had
a little, and appealed to the improved state of
things as a proof that she knew better than he
the use of money. He demanded the said
money. She refused-he leathered her she put
him in prison.
This was the best place for him. The man

was a drunkard, and all the riches of Egypt
would never have made him better off.
And here, gentlemen of the lower classes, a
word with you. How can you, with your small
incomes, hope to be well off, if you are more
extravagant than those who have large ones?
“Us extravagant?" you reply.
Yes! your income is ten shillings a-week; out
of that you spend three shillings in drink; ay!
you the sober ones. You can't afford it, my
boys. Find me a man whose income is a thou-
sand a-year; well, if he imitates you, and spends
three hundred upon sensuality, I bet you the
odd seven hundred, he does not make both
ends meet; the proportion is too great. And
two-thirds of the distress of the lower orders is
owing to this—that they are more madly prodigal
than the rich; in the worst, lowest, and most
dangerous item of all human prodigality!
Lord Ipsden went to see Mrs. Harvey; it
cost him much to go; she lived in the Old
Town, and he hated disagreeable smells; he also
knew from Saunders that she had two black
eyes, and he hated women with black eyes of

that sort. But this good creature did go; did
relieve Mrs. Harvey; and, bare-headed, suffered
himself to be bedewed ten minutes by her tear-
ful twaddle.
For once, Virtue was rewarded: returning
over the North Bridge, he met somebody whom,
but for his charity, he would not have met.
He came in one bright moment plump upon
- Lady Barbara Sinclair. She flushed, he
trembled, and in two minutes he had forgotten
every human event that had passed since last he
was by her side.
She seemed pleased to see him, too; she
ignored entirely his obnoxious proposal; he
wisely took her cue, and so, on this secret
understanding, they were friends. He made his
arrangements, and dined with her family. It
was a family party. In the evening Lady Barbara
allowed it to transpire that she had made in-
quiries about him.
(He was highly flattered): and she had dis-
covered he was lying hid somewhere in the
neighbourhood.
“Studying the guitar?" inquired she.

“No,” said he, “studying a new class of the
community. Do you know any of what they call
the 'lower classes?!”
“Yes."
“Monstrous agreeable people, are they not?"
“No, very stupid! I only know two old
women - except the servants, who have no
characters. They imitate us, I suspect, which
does not say much for their taste."
“But some of my friends are young women,
that makes all the difference.”
“It does! and you ought to be ashamed. If
you want a low order of mind, why desert our
own circle?"
“My friends are only low in station; they
have rather lofty minds, some of them.”
“Well, amuse yourself with these lofty
minds. Amusement is the end of being, you
know, and the aim of all the men of this day."
“We imitate the ladies,” said he, slily.
“You do," answered she, very drily; and so
the dialogue went on, and Lord Ipsden found
the pleasure of being with his cousin compensate
him fully for the difference of their opinions; in

125
fact, he found it simply amusing that so keen a
wit as his cousin's could be entrapped into the
humour of decrying the time one happens to live
in, and admiring any epoch one knows next to
nothing about, and entrapped by the notion of
its originality, above all things; the idea being
the stale common-place of asses in every age,
and the manner of conveying the idea being a
mere imitation of the German writers, not the
good ones, bien entendu, but the quill-drivers, the
snobs of the Teutonic pen.
But he was to learn that follies are not always
laughable, that eadem sentire is a bond, and that
when a clever and pretty woman chooses to be
a fool, her lover, if he is wise, will be a greater
-if he can.
The next time they met Lord Ipsden found
Lady Barbara occupied with a gentleman,
whose first sentence proclaimed him a pupil
of Mr. Thomas Carlyle, and he had the morti-
fication to find that she had neither an ear nor
an eye for him.
Human opinion has so many shades, that it
is rare to find two people agree.


## p. 126 (#130) ############################################

126
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
But two people may agree wonderfully, if
they will but let a third think for them both.
Thus it was that these two ran so smoothly
in couples.
Antiquity, they agreed, was the time when
the world was old, its hair grey, its head wise.
Every one that said “Lord, Lord!” two hundred
years ago, was a Christian. There were no
earnest men now; Williams, the missionary, who
lived and died for the Gospel, was not earnest
in religion; but Cromwell, who packed a jury,
and so murdered his prisoner,—Cromwell, in
whose mouth was heaven, and in his heart tem-
poral sovereignty, was the pattern of earnest reli-
gion, or, at all events, second in sincerity to
Mahomet alone, in the absence of details re-
specting Satan, of whom we know only that his
mouth is a scripture concordance, and his hands
the hands of Mr. Carlyle's saints.
Then they went back a century or two, and
were eloquent about the great antique heart, and
the beauty of an age whose samples were Abbot
Sampson and Joan of Arc.
Lord Ipsden hated argument; but jealousy is

a brass spur, it made even this man fluent for
once.
He suggested “That five hundred years
added to a world's life made it just five hundred
years older, not younger, and if older, greyer,-
and if greyer, wiser.
“Of Abbot Sampson,” said he, “whom I con-
fess both a great and a good man, his author,
who with all his talent belongs to the class
muddle-head, tells us, that when he had been
two years in authority his red hair had turned
grey, fighting against the spirit of his age; how
the deuce, then, could he be a sample of the
spirit of his age?
"Joan of Arc was burnt by acclamation of
her age, and is admired by our age. Which fact
identifies an age most with a heroine, to give her
your heart, or to give her a blazing faggot and
death?
“Abbot Sampson and Joan of Arc," con-
cluded he, "prove no more in favour of their
age, and no less against it, than Lot does for or
against Sodom. Lot was in Sodom, but not of it;

and so were Sampson and Joan in, but not of,
the villanous times they lived in.
“The very best text-book of true religion is
the New Testament, and I gather from it, that the
man who forgives his enemies whilst their axe
descends on his head, however poor a creature he
may be in other respects, is a better Christian
than the man who has the God of Mercy for
ever on his lips, and whose hands are swift to
shed blood.
“The earnest men of former ages are not ex-
tinct in this," added he. “Whenever a scaffold
is erected outside a prison door, if you are earn-
est in pursuit of truth, and can put up with dis-
gusting objects, you shall see a relic of ancient
manners hung.
“There still exist, in parts of America, rivers
on whose banks are earnest men, who shall take
your scalp, the wife's of your bosom, and the in-
nocent child's of her bosom.
"In England we are as earnest as ever in
pursuit of heaven, and of innocent worldly ad-
vantages. If, when the consideration of life and
death interposes, we appear less earnest in pur-

suit of comparative trifles, such as kingdoms or
dogmas, it is because, cooler in action we are
more earnest in thought,-because reason, ex-
perience, and conscience are things that check
the unscrupulousness or beastly earnestness of
man.
“Moreover, he who has the sense to see that
questions have three sides, is no longer so intel-
lectually as well as morally degraded as to be
able to cut every throat that utters an opinion
contrary to his own.
“If the phrase "earnest man' means man
imitating the beasts that are deaf to reason, it is
to be hoped that civilization and Christianity will
really extinguish the whole race for the benefit of
the earth.”
Lord Ipsden succeeded in annoying the fair
theorist, but not in convincing her.
The mediæval enthusiasts looked on him as
some rough animal that had burst into sacred
grounds unconsciously, and gradually edged away
from him.

CHAPTER X.
LORD IPSDEN had soon the mortification of
discovering that this Mr. * * was a constant
visitor at the house; and although his cousin
gave him her ear in this man's absence, on the
arrival of her fellow-enthusiast he had ever the
mortification of finding himself de trop.
Once or twice he demolished this personage
in argument, and was rewarded by finding him-
self more de trop.
But one day Lady Barbara, being in a cousinly
humour, expressed a wish to sail in his Lord-
ship’s yacht, and this hint soon led to a party
being organized, and a sort of pic-nic on the is-
land of Inch Coombe; his Lordship’s cutter being
the mode of conveyance to and from that spot.
Now it happened that on that very day Jean
Carnie's marriage was celebrated on that very is-
land by her relations and friends.

Pic-Nic, No. 1.
The servants were employed in putting away
dishes into hampers.
There was a calm silence.
“Hem,” observed Sir Henry Talbot.
“Eh?” replied the Honourable Tom Hither-
ington.
“Mamma,” said Miss Vere, “have you brought
any work?”
“No, my dear.”
“At a pic-nic,” said Mr. Hitherington, “isn't
it the thing for somebody-aw-to do some-
thing?"
“Ipsden," said Lady Barbara, “there is an
understanding between you and Mr. Hitherington.
I condemn you to turn him into English.”
“Yes, Lady Barbara; I'll tell you, he means

Hitherington. “Can't anybody guess what I
mean?”
Lady Barbara. “Guess first yourself, you can't
be suspected of being in the secret.”
Hither. “What I mean is, that people sing a
song, or run races, or preach a sermon, or do
something funny at a pick-nic,-aw-somebody
gets up and does something."
Lady Bar. “Then perhaps Miss Vere, whose
singing is famous, will have the complaisance to
sing to us.”
Miss Vere. “I should be happy, Lady Barbara,
but I have not brought my music.”
Lady Bar. “Oh, we are not critical; the
simplest air, or even a fragment of melody; the
sea and the sky will be a better accompaniment
than Broadwood ever made.”
Miss V. “I can't sing a note without book.”
Sir H. Talbot, “Your music is in your soul-
not at your fingers' ends.”
Lord Ipsden, to Lady Bar. “It is in her book,
and not in her soul.”

Lady Bar., to Lord Ips. “Then it has chosen
the better situation of the two."
Ips. “Miss Vere is to the fine art of music,
what the engrossers are to the black art of law;
it all filters through them without leaving any
sediment; and so the music of the day passes
through Miss Vere's mind, but none remains—to
stain its virgin snow." He bows, she smiles.
Lady Bar., to herself. "Insolent: and the little
dunce thinks he is complimenting her.”
Ips. "Perhaps Talbot will come to our rescue
he is a fiddler.”
Tal. “An amateur of the violin.”

vulgar?”
Christie. “Voolgar folk sit on an chair, ane,

The music chimed in, and the moment the
song was done, without pause, or anything to
separate or chill the succession of the arts, the
fiddles diverged with a gallant plunge into “The
Dusty Miller.” The dancers found their feet by
an instinct as rapid, and a rattling reel shook
the floor like thunder. Jean Carnie assumed the
privilege of a bride, and seized his Lordship;
Christie, who had a mind to dance with him
too, took Flucker captive, and these four were
one reel! There were seven others.
The principle of reel dancing is articulation:
the foot strikes the ground for every accented
note, (and by-the-by, it is their weakness of accent

which makes all English reel and hornpipe players
such failures).
And in the best steps of all, which it has in
common with the hornpipe, such as the quick
“heel and toe," "the sailor's fing," and the
“double shuffle," the foot strikes the ground for
every single note of the instrument.
All good dancing is beautiful.
But this articulate dancing, compared with
the loose, lawless diffluence of motion that goes
by that name, gives me (I must confess it)
as much more pleasure as articulate singing is
superior to tunes played on the voice by a young
lady.
Or the clean playing of my mother to the
piano-forte splashing of my daughter; though the
latter does attack the instrument as a washer-
woman her soapsuds, and the former works like
a lady.
Or skating to sliding:
Or English verse to dactyls in English:
Or painting to daubing:
Or preserved strawberries to strawberry jam.

What says Goldsmith of the two styles?
“They swam, sprawled, frisked, and lan-
guished; but Olivia's foot was as pat to the music
as its echo.”- Vicar of Wakefield.
Newhaven dancing aims also at fun; laughter
mingles with agility; grotesque, yet graceful
gestures are flung in, and little inspiriting cries
flung out.
· His Lordship soon entered into the spirit of
it. Deep in the mystery of the hornpipe, he
danced one or two steps Jean and Christie had
never seen, but their eyes were instantly on his
feet, and they caught in a minute, and executed
these same steps.
To see Christie Johnstone do the double
shuffle with her arms so saucily a-kimbo, and
her quick elastic foot at an angle of forty-five,
was a treat.
The dance became inspiriting, inspiring, in-
toxicating; and when the fiddles at last left off,
the feet went on another seven bars by the en-
thusiastic impulse.
And so, alternately spinning yarns, singing

songs, dancing, and making fun, and mingling
something of heart and brain in all, these
benighted creatures made themselves happy in-
stead of peevish, and with a day of stout,
vigorous, healthy pleasure, refreshed, indemni-
fied and warmed themselves for many a day
of toil.
Such were the two pic-nics of Inch-Coombe,
and these rival cliques, agreeing in nothing else,
would have agreed in this: each, if allowed (but
we won't allow either) to judge the other, would
have pronounced the same verdict-
“Ils ne savent pas vivre ces gens-là."

CHAPTER XI.
Two of our personages left Inch-Coombe less
happy than when they came to it.
Lord Ipsden encountered Lady Barbara with
Mr. --, who had joined her upon the island.
He found them discoursing, as usual, about
the shams of the present day, and the sincerity
of Cromwell and Mahomet, and he found himself
de trop.
They made him, for the first time, regret the
loss of those earnest times, when, “to avoid the
inconvenience of both addressing the same lady,"
you could cut a rival's throat at once, and be
smiled on by the fair and society.
That a book-maker should blaspheme high
civilization, by which alone he exists, and one of
whose diseases and flying pains he is, neither
surprised nor moved him; but that any human
being's actions should be affected by such tempes-
tuous twaddle, was ridiculous.


## p. 160 (#164) ############################################

160
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
And that the witty Lady Barbara should be
caught by this chaff was intolerable; he began to
feel bitter.
He had the blessings of the poor, the good
opinion of the world; every living creature was
prepossessed in his favour but one, and that one
despised him; it was a diabolical prejudice; it
was the spiteful caprice of his fate.
His heart, for a moment, was in danger of
deteriorating. He was miserable; the devil sug-
gested to him, “make others miserable too;" and
he listened to the advice.
There was a fine breeze, but instead of sailing
on a wind, as he might have done, he made a
series of tacks, and all were ill.
The earnest man first; and Flucker announced
the skipper's insanity to the whole town of New-
haven, for, of course, these tacks were all marine
solecisms.
The other discontented Pic-nician was Christie
Johnstone. Gatty never came; and this, coupled
with five or six days' previous neglect, could no
longer pass unnoticed.

Her gaiety failed her before the afternoon
was ended; and the last two hours were spent
by her alone, watching the water on all sides
for him.
At last, long after the departure of his Lord-
ship’s yacht, the Newhaven boat sailed from Inch-
Coombe with the wedding party. There was now
a strong breeze, and the water every now and
then came on board; so the men set the foresail
with two reefs, and drew the mainsail over the
women; and there, as they huddled together in
the dark, Jean Carnie discovered that our gay
story-teller's eyes were 'wet with tears.
· Jean said nothing; she embraced her, and
made them flow faster.
But when they came alongside the pier, Jean,
who was the first to get her head from under the
sail, whipped it back again, and said to Christie,
“Here he is, Christie; dinna speak till him.”
And sure enough there was, in the twilight,
with a pale face and an uneasy look-Mr. Charles
Gatty!
He peered timidly into the boat, and when

he saw Christie, an “Ah!” that seemed to mean
twenty different things at once, burst from his
bosom. He held out his arm to assist her.
She cast on him one glance of mute reproach,
and placing her foot on the boat's gunwale,
sprang like an antelope upon the pier, without
accepting his assistance.
Before going farther, we must go back for this
boy, and conduct him from where we left him up
to the present point.
The moment he found himself alone with
Jean Carnie, in his own house, he began to tell
her what trouble he was in; how his mother had
convinced him of his imprudence in falling in
love with Christie Johnstone; and how she insisted
on a connexion being broken off, which had given
him his first glimpse of heaven upon earth, and
was contrary to common sense.
Jean heard him out, and then, with the air
of a lunatic asylum keeper to a rhodomontading
patient, told him "he was one fool, and his
mother was another.” First she took him up on
the score of prudence.

“You,” said she, "are a beggarly painter,
without a rap; Christie has houses, boats, nets
and money: you are in debt; she lays by money
every week. It is not prudent on her part to
take up with you—the better your bargain, my
lad.”
Under the head of common sense, which she
maintained was all on the same side of the
question, she calmly inquired-
“How could an old woman of sixty be com-
petent to judge how far human happiness depends
on love, when she has no experience of that pas-
sion, and the reminiscences of her youth have
become dim and dark? You might as well set a
judge in court, that has forgotten the law,-com-
mon sense,” said she; "the old wife is sixty, and
you are twenty-what can she do for you the
forty years you may reckon to outlive her? Who
is to keep you through those weary years, but the
wife of your own choice, not your mother's? You
English does na read the Bible, or ye'd ken that
a lad is to leave his father and mother, and
cleave until his wife,'” added she; then, with great

contempt, she repeated, “common sense, indeed!
ye’re fou wi’ your common sense; ye hae the
name o't pat eneuch—but there's na muckle o'
that mairchandize in your harns.”
Gatty was astonished: what! was there really
common sense on the side of bliss? and when
Jean told him to join her party at Inch Coombe,
or never look her in the face again, scales seemed
to fall from his eyes; and with a heart that turned
in a moment from lead to a feather, he vowed he
would be at Inch Coombe.
He then begged Jean on no account to tell
Christie the struggle he had been subjected to,
since his scruples were now entirely conquered.
Jean acquiesced at once, and said, “Indeed,
she would be very sorry to give the lass that
muckle pain.”
She hinted, moreover, that her neebor's spirit
was so high, she was quite capable of breaking
with him at once upon such an intimation; and
she, Jean, was “nae mischief-maker.”
In the energy of his gratitude, he kissed this

dark-browed beauty, professing to see in her a
sister.
And she made no resistance to this way of
showing gratitude, but muttered between her teeth,
“He's just a bairn!"
And so she went about her business.
On her retreat, his mother returned to him,
and, with a sad air, hoped nothing that that rude
girl had said had weakened his filial duty.
“No, mother," said he.
She then, without explaining how she came
acquainted with Jean's arguments, proceeded to
demolish them one by one.
"If your mother is old and experienced," said
she, “benefit by her age and experience. She
has not forgotten love, nor the ills it leads to,
when not fortified by prudence. Scripture says,
a man shall cleave to his wife when he has left
his parents; but in making that, the most im-
portant step of life, where do you read that he is
to break the fifth commandment? But I do you
wrong, Charles, you never could have listened to

that vulgar girl when she told you your mother
was not your best friend.”
“N—no, mother, of course not.”
“Then you will not go to that place to break
my heart, and undo all you have done this
week.”
“I should like to go, mother.”
“ You will break my heart if you do."
“Christie will feel herself slighted, and she
has not deserved this treatment from me.”
“The other will explain to her, and if she is
as good a girl as you say—”.
“She is an angel!”
“How can a fishwife be an angel? Well, then,
she will not set a son to disobey his mother.”
“I don't think she would! but is all the good-
ness to be on her side?”
“No, Charles, you do your part; deny your-
self, be an obedient child, and your mother's
blessing and the blessing of Heaven will rest
upon you."
In short, he was not to go to Inch Coombe.
He stayed at home, his mother set him to

work; he made a poor hand of it, he was so
wretched. She at last took compassion on him,
and in the evening, when it was now too late for
a sail to Inch Coombe, she herself recommended
a walk to him.
The poor boy's feet took him towards New-
haven, not that he meant to go to his love, but
he could not forbear from looking at the place
which held her.
He was about to return, when a spacious
blue jacket hailed him. Somewhere inside this
jacket was Master Flucker, who had returned in
the yacht, leaving his sister on the island.
Gatty. instantly poured out a flood of ques-
tions.
The baddish boy reciprocated fluency: he in-
formed him “that his sister had been the star of
a goodly company, and that her own lad having
stayed away, she had condescended to make a
conquest of the skipper himself.
“He had come in quite at the tag end of
one of her stories, but it had been sufficient to
do his business-he had danced with her, had

even whistled whilst she sung, (hech, it was
bonny!)
“And when the cutter sailed, he, Flucker,
had seen her perched on a rock, like a mer-
maid, watching their progress, which had been
slow, because the skipper, infatuated with so
sudden a passion, had made a series of un-
grammatical tacks.”
For his part he was glad, said the gracious
Flucker; the lass was a prideful hussy, that had
given some twenty lads a sore heart and him
many a sore back; and he hoped his skipper,
with whom he naturally identified himself rather
than with his sister, would avenge the male sex
upon her.”
In short, he went upon this tack till he drove
poor Gatty nearly mad.
Here was a new feeling superadded; at first
he felt injured, but on reflection what cause of
complaint had he?
• He had neglected her; he might have been
her partner-he had left her to find one where
she could.

Fool, to suppose that so beautiful a creature
would ever be neglected—except by him!
It was more than he could bear.
He determined to see her, to ask her for-
giveness, to tell her everything, to beg her to
decide, and, for his part, he would abide by her
decision.
Christie Johnstone, as we have already re-
lated, declined his arm, sprang like a deer upon
the pier, and walked towards her home, a quarter
of a mile distant.
Gatty followed her, disconsolately, hardly
knowing what to do.
At last, observing that she drew near enough
to the wall to allow room for another on the
causeway, he had just nous enough to creep
alongside, and pull her sleeve somewhat timidly.
“Christie, I want to speak to you.”
“What can ye hae to say till me?”
“Christie, I am very unhappy; and I want to
tell you why, but I have hardly the strength or
the courage."

“Ye shall come ben my hoose if ye are un-
happy, and we'll hear your story: come away.”
He had never been admitted into her house
before.
They found it clean as a snowdrift.
They found a bright fire, and Flucker frying
innumerable steaks.
The baddish boy had obtained them in his
sister's name and at her expense, at the flesher's,
and claimed credit for his affection.
Potatoes he had boiled in their jackets, and
so skilfully, that those jackets hung by a thread.
Christie laid an unbleached table-cloth, that
somehow looked sweeter than a white one, as
brown bread is sweeter than white.
But lo, Gatty could not eat; so then Christie
would not, because he refused her cheer.
The baddish boy chuckled, and addressed
himself to the nice brown steaks with their rich
gravy.
On such occasions a solo on the knife and
fork seemed better than a trio to the gracious
Flucker.

Christie moved about the room, doing little
household matters, Gatty's eye followed her.
Her beauty lost nothing in this small apart-
ment; she was here, like a brilliant in some
quaint, rough setting, which all earth's jewellers
should despise, and all its poets admire, and it
should show off the stone and not itself.
Her beauty filled the room, and almost made
the spectators ill.
Gatty asked himself whether he could really
have been such a fool as to think of giving up
so peerless a creature.
Suddenly an idea occurred to him, a bright
one, and not inconsistent with a true artist's
character-he would decline to act in so doubt-
ful a case: he would float passively down the
tide of events—he would neither desert her, nor
disobey his mother; he would take everything as
it came, and to begin, as he was there, he would
for the present say nothing but what he felt, and
what he felt was that he loved her.
He told her so accordingly.
She replied, concealing her satisfaction,

" that if he liked her, he would not have refused
to eat when she asked him.”
But our hero's appetite had returned with his
change of purpose, and he instantly volunteered
to give the required proof of affection.
Accordingly two pound of steaks fell before
him.
Poor boy—he had hardly eaten a genuine
meal for a week past.
Christie sat opposite him, and every time he
looked off his plate, he saw her rich blue eyes
dwelling on him.
Everything contributed to warm his heart,
he yielded to the spell, he became contented,
happy, gay.
Flucker ginger-cordialed him; his sister be-
witched him.
She related the day's events in a merry
mood.
Mr. Gatty burst forth into singing.
He sung two light and sombre trifles, such
as in the present day are deemed generally
encouraging to the spirits, and particularly in

accordance with the sentiment of supper—they
were about Death, and Ivy Green.
The dog's voice was not very powerful, but
sweet and round as honey dropping from the
comb.
His two hearers were entranced, for the
creature sang with an inspiration good singers
dare not indulge.
He concluded by informing Christie that the
ivy was symbolical of her, and the oak prefigured
Charles Gatty, Esq.
He might have inverted the simile with more
truth.
In short, he never said a word to Christie
about parting with her, but several about being
buried in the same grave with her, sixty years
hence, for which, the spot he selected was West-
minster Abbey.
And away he went, leaving golden opinions
behind him.
The next day, Christie was so affected with
his conduct, coming as it did, after an apparent
coolness, that she conquered her bashfulness and
called on the “Vile Count,” and with some

blushes and hesitation, inquired “Whether a
painter lad was a fit subject of charity.”
“Why not?” said his Lordship.
She then told him Gatty's case, and he
instantly promised to see that artist's pictures,
particularly ane “awfu' bonny ane;" the hero
of which she described, as an English minister
blessing the bairns with one hand, and giving
orders to kill the puir Scoetch with the other.
“C'est égal,” said Christie in Scotch, "it's
awfu' bonny."
Gatty reached home late; his mother had-
retired to rest.
But the next morning she drew from him
what had happened, and then ensued another
of those dialogues which I am ashamed again
to give the reader.
Suffice it to say, that she once more prevailed,
though with far greater difficulty; time was to be
given him to unsew a connection which he could
not cut asunder, and he, with tearful eyes and a
heavy heart, agreed to take some step the very
first opportunity.

This concession was hardly out of his mouth,
ere his mother made him kneel down and be-
stowed her blessing upon him. He received it
coldly and dully, and expressed a languid hope
it might prove a charm to save him from
despair; and sad, bitter, and dejected, forced
himself to sit down and work on the picture
that was to meet his unrelenting creditor's de-
mand.
He was working on his picture, and his
mother, with her needle at the table, when a
knock was heard, and gay as a lark, and fresh
as the dew on the shamrock, Christie Johnstone
stood in person in the apartment.
She was evidently the bearer of good tidings;
but before she could express them, Mrs. Gatty
beckoned her son aside, and announcing, “she
should be within hearing,” bade him take the
occasion that so happily presented itself, and
make the first step.
At another time, Christie, who had learned
from Jean the arrival of Mrs. Gatty, would have
been struck with the old lady's silence; but she
came to tell the depressed painter that the

charitable Viscount was about to visit him and
his picture; and she was so full of the good
fortune likely to ensue, that she was neglectful of
minor considerations.
It so happened, however, that certain inter-
ruptions prevented her from ever delivering her-
self of the news in question.
First, Gatty himself came to her, and casting
uneasy glances at the door, by which his mother
had just gone out, said:-
“Christie.”
“My lad!”
“I want to paint your likeness.
This was for a souvenir, poor fellow!
“Hech! I wad like fine to be painted.”
“It must be exactly the same size as your-
self, and so like you, that should we be parted
I may seem not to be quite alone in the world."
Here he was obliged to turn his head away.
“But we'll no pairt,” replied Christie, cheer-
fully. “Suppose ye're puir, I'm rich, and it's
a’ one; dinna be so cast down for auchty pund.”
At this, a slipshod servant entered, and said,

“There's a fisher lad, inquiring for Christie
Johnstone."
“It will be Flucker,” said Christie; “show him
ben. What's wrang the noo, I wonder!”
The baddish boy entered, took up a posi-
tion, and remained apparently passive, hands in
pockets.
Christie. “Aweel, what est?"
Flucker. “Custy."
Christie. “What's your will, my manny?”
Flucker. “Custy, I was at Inch Keith the day.”
Christie. “And hae ye really come to Edinbro'
to tell me thaat?"
Flucker (drily). “Oh! ye ken the lasses are
a hantle wiser than we are—will ye hear me?
South Inch Keith, I played a bowl i' the water,
just for divairsion, and I catched twarree fish!"
Christie. “Floonders, I bet.”
Flucker. “Does floonders swim high? I'll let
you see his gills, and if ye are a reicht fishwife
ye'll smell bluid.
Here he opened his jacket, and showed a
bright little fish.
Christie Johnstone.

In a moment all Christie's nonchalance gave
way to a fiery animation. She darted to Flucker's
side.
“Ye hae na been sae daft as tell?" asked she.
Flucker shook his head contemptuously.
“Ony birds at the island, Flucker?"
“Sea-maws, plenty, and a bird I dinna ken;
he moonted sae high, then doon like thunder
intil the sea, and gart the water flee as high as
Haman, and porpoises as big as my boat."
“Porr-poises, fulish laddy-ye hae seen the
herrin whale at his wark, and the solant guse ye
hae seen her at wark; and beneath the sea,
Flucker, every coed-fish and doeg-fish, and fish
that has teeth, is after them; and half Scotland
wad be at Inch Keith Island if they kenned what
ye hae tellit me-dinna speak to me.”
During this, Gatty, who did not comprehend
this sudden excitement, or thought it childish,
had tried in vain to win her attention.
At last he said, a little peevishly, “Will you
not attend to me, and tell me at least, when you
will sit to me?"

“Set!” cried she. “When there's nae wark
to be done stanning."
And with this she was gone. At the foot of
the stairs, she said to her brother,
“Puir lad! I'll sune draw auchty punds fra'
the sea for him, with my feyther's nets.”
As she disappeared, Mrs. Gatty appeared.
“And this is the woman whose mind was not
in her dirty business," cried she.
“Does not that open your eyes, Charles?”
“Ah! Charles,” added she, tenderly, “there's
no friend like a mother.”
And off she carried the prize,-his vanity had
been mortified.
And so that happened to Christie Johnstone
which has befallen many a woman,—the great-
ness of her love made that love appear small to
her lover.
“Ah! mother," cried he, “I must live for you
and my art; I am not so dear to her as I thought.”
And so, with a sad heart, he turned away
from her; whilst she, with a light heart, darted
away to think and act for him.

CHAPTER XII.
It was some two hours after this that a gen-
tleman, plainly dressed, but whose clothes seemed
a part of himself — (whereas mine I have ob-
served hang upon me; and the Rev. Josiah
Splitall's stick to him)-glided into the painter's
room, with an inquiry whether he had not a
picture or two disposable.
“I have one finished picture, sir," said the
poor boy; “but the price is high!"
He brought it, in a faint-hearted way; for he
had shown it to five picture-dealers, and all five
agreed it was hard.
He had painted a lime-tree, distant fifty yards,
and so painted it that it looked something like a
lime-tree fifty yards off.
“That was mesquin,” said his judges; "the
poetry of painting required abstract trees, at
metaphysical distance, not the various trees of
nature, as they appear under positive accidents.”


## p. 181 (#185) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
181
On this Mr. Gatty had deluged them with
words.
“When it is art, truth, or sense, to fuse a
cow, a horse, and a critic, into one undis-
tinguishable quadruped, with six legs, then it will
be art to melt an ash, an elm, and a lime, things
that differ more than quadrupeds, into what you
call abstract trees, that any man who has seen a
tree, as well as looked at one, would call
drunken stinging-nettles. You, who never look
at nature, how can you judge the arts, which are
all but copies of nature? At two hundred yards
distance full-grown trees are more distinguishable
than the animal tribe. Paint me an abstract
human being, neither man nor a woman,” said
he, "and then I will agree to paint a tree that
shall be no tree; and if no man will buy it, perhaps
the father of lies will take it off my hands, and
hang it in the only place it would not disgrace.”
In short, he never left off till he had crushed
the non-buyers with eloquence and satire; but he
could not crush them into buyers, they beat him
at the passive retort.


## p. 182 (#186) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Poor Gatty, when the momentary excitement
of argument had subsided, drank the bitter cup
all must drink awhile, whose bark is alive and
strong enough to stem the current down which
the dead, weak things of the world are drifting,
many of them into safe harbours.
And now he brought out his picture with a
heavy heart.
“Now," said he to himself, “this gentleman
will talk me dead, and leave me no richer in coin,
and poorer in time and patience.”
The picture was placed in a light, the visitor
sat down before it.
A long pause ensued.
“Has he fainted?” thought Gatty, ironically,
“he doesn't gabble.”
"If you do not mind painting before me,”
said the visitor, “I should be glad if you would
continue whilst I look into this picture."
Gatty painted.
The visitor held his tongue.
At first the silence made the artist uneasy,
but by degrees it began to give him pleasure;

whoever this was, it was not one of the flies that
had hitherto stung him, nor the jackdaws that
had chattered him dead.
Glorious silence! he began to paint under its
influence like one inspired.
Half an hour passed thus.
“What is the price of this work of art?"
“Eighty pounds."
"I take it,” said his visitor, quietly.
What, no more difficulty than that? He
felt almost disappointed at gaining his object so
easily.
“I am obliged to you, sir; much obliged to
you," he added, for he reflected what eighty
pounds were to him just then.
"It is my descendants who are obliged to
you,” replied the gentleman; “the picture is im-
mortal!"
These words were an epoch in the painter's
life.
The grave, silent inspection that had pre-
ceded them, the cool, deliberate, masterly tone in
which they were said, made them oracular to him.


## p. 184 (#188) ############################################

194

Words of such import took him by surprise.
He had thirsted for average praise in vain.
A hand had taken him, and placed him at
the top of the tree.
He retired abruptly, or he would have burst
into tears.
He ran to his mother.
“Mother," said he, “I am a painter; I always
thought so at bottom, but I suppose it is the
height of my ideas makes me discontented with
my work."
“What has happened?”
“There is a critic in my room. I had no
idea there was a critic in the creation, and there
is one in my room.”
“Has he bought your picture, my poor boy?"
said Mrs. Gatty, distrustfully.
To her surprise he replied;
“Yes! he has got it; only eighty pounds for
an immortal picture." I
Mrs. Gatty was overjoyed, Gatty was a little
sad; but reviving, he professed himself glad; the
picture was going to a judge.

“It is not much money,” said he, “but the
man has spoken words that are ten thousand
pounds to me."
He returned to the room; his visitor, hat in
hand, was about to go; a few words were spoken
about the art of painting, this led to a con-
versation, and then to a short discussion.
The new comer soon showed Mr. Charles
Gatty his ignorance of facts..
This man had sat quietly before a multitude
of great pictures, new and old, in Europe.
He cooled down Charles Gatty, Esq., mono-
polist of nature and truth.
He quoted to him thirty painters in Ger-
many, who paint every stroke of a landscape in
the open air, and forty in various nations who
had done it in times past.
“You, sir," he went on, “appear to hang on
the skirts of a certain clique, who handle the
brush well, but draw ill, and look at nature
through the spectacles of certain ignorant pain-
ters who spoiled canvass four hundred years ago.
“Go no farther in that direction.

“Those boys like all quacks, have one great
truth which they disfigure with more than one
falsehood.
“Hold fast their truth, which is a truth the
world has always possessed, though its practice
has been confined to the honest and laborious
few.
“Eschew their want of mind and taste.
"Shrink with horror from that profane culte
de laideur, that 'love of the lop-sided, they have
recovered from the foul receptacles of decayed
art."
He reminded him further, that “Art is not
imitation, but illusion; that a plumber and
glazier of our day and a mediæval painter are
more alike than any two representatives of
general styles that can be found; and for the
same reason, namely, that with each of these, art
is in its infancy; these two sets of bunglers have
not learned how to produce the illusions of art."
To all this he added a few words of com-
pliment on the mind, as well as mechanical
dexterity, of the purchased picture, bade him

good morning, and glided away like a passing
sunbeam.
“A mother's blessing is a great thing to have,
and to deserve,” said Mrs. Gatty, who had re-
joined her son.
“It is, indeed," said Charles. He could not
help being struck by the coincidence.
He had made a sacrifice to his mother, and
in a few hours one of his troubles had melted
away.
In the midst of these reflections arrived Mr.
Saunders with a note.
The note contained a cheque for one hun-
dred and fifty pounds, with these lines, in which
the writer excused himself for the amendment:
“I am a painter myself,” said he, “and it is impos-
sible that eighty pounds can remunerate the time
expended on this picture, to say nothing of the
skill.”
We have treated this poor boy's picture
hitherto with just contempt, but now that it is
gone into a famous collection, mind, we always
admired it; we always said so, we take our

oath we did; if we have hitherto deferred framing
it, that was merely because it was not sold.
MR. GATTY'S PICTURE, AT PRESENT IN THE
COLLECTION OF LORD IPSDEN!
There was, hundreds of years ago, a certain
Bishop of Durham, who used to fight in person
against the Scotch, and defeat them. When he
was not with his flock, the northern wolves some-
times scattered it; but when the holy father was
there, with his prayers and his battle-axe, Eng-
land won the day!
This nettled the Scottish king, so he pene-
trated one day, with a large band, as far as
Durham itself, and for a short time blocked the
prelate up in his stronghold. This was the
period of Mr. Gatty's picture;
Whose title was,
“Half Church of God, half Tower against the
Scot.”
In the background was the cathedral, on the
towers of which paced to and fro men in armour.
with the western sun glittering thereon. In the
centre, a horse and cart, led by a boy, were car-
este

rying a sheaf of arrows, tied with a straw-band.
In part of the foreground was the prelate, in a
half suit of armour, but bare-headed; he was
turning away from the boy, to whom his sinking
hand had indicated his way into the holy castle, and
his benignant glance rested on a child, whom its
mother was holding up for his benediction. In
the foreground 'the afternoon beams sprinkled
gold on a long glassy slope, corresponding to
the elevation on which the cathedral stood,
separated by the river Wear from the group; and
these calm beauties of Nature, with the mother and
child, were the peaceful side of this twofold story.
Such are the dry details. But the soul of
its charm no pen can fing on paper. For the
stately cathedral stood and lived; the little leaves
slumbered yet lived; and the story floated and
lived, in the potable gold of the summer afternoon.
To look at this painted poem was to feel a
thrill of pleasure in bare existence; it went
through the eyes, where paintings stop, and
warmed the depths and recesses of the heart,
with its sunshine and its glorious air.

CHAPTER XIII.
“What is in the wind this dark night? Six
Newhaven boats and twenty boys and hobble-de-
hoys hired by the Johnstones at half-a-crown
each for a night's job.”
“Secret service!"
“What is it for?”
“I think it is a smuggling lay," suggested
Flucker, “but we shall know all in good time.”
“Smuggling!” Their countenances fell, they
had hoped something more nearly approaching
the illegal.
“Maybe she has fand the herrin'," said a ten-
year old.
“Haw! haw! haw!" went the others. “She
find the herrin', when there's five hundred fisher-
men after them baith sides the Firrth.”
The youngster was discomfited.
In fact the expedition bore no signs of fishing,

The six boats sailed at sundown, led by
Flucker; he brought-to on the south side of
Inch Keith, and nothing happened for about an
hour.
Then such boys as were awake, saw two
great eyes of light coming up from Granton;
rattle went the chain cable, and Lord Ipsden's
cutter swung at anchor in four fathom water.
A thousand questions to Flucker.
A single puff of tobacco smoke was his
answer.
And now crept up a single eye of light from
Leith; she came among the boats; the boys re-
cognized a crazy old cutter from Leith harbour,
with Christie Johnstone on board.
“What is that brown heap on her deck?”
“A mountain of nets — fifty stout herring
nets."
Tunc manifesta fides
A yell burst from all the boys.
“He's gaun to tak us to Dunbar.”
“Half-a-crown! ye're no blate.”
Christie ordered the boats alongside her cutter,

and five nets were dropped into each boat, six
into Flucker's.
The depth of water was given them, and they
were instructed to shoot their nets so as to keep
a fathom and a half above the rocky bottom.
. A herring net is simply a wall of meshes
twelve feet deep fifty feet long; it sinks to a
vertical position by the weight of net twine,
and is kept from sinking to the bottom of the
sea by bladders or corks. These nets are tied
to one another, and paid out at the stern of
the boat. Boat and nets drift with the tide,
if therefore the nets touched the rocks they
would be torn to pieces, and the fisherman ruined.
And this saves the herring — that fish lies
hours and hours at the very bottom of the sea,
like a stone, and the poor fisherman shall drive
with his nets, a yard or two over a square mile
of fish, and not catch a herring tail; on the
other hand, if they rise to play for five minutes,
in that five minutes they shall fill seven hundred
boats.
At nine o'clock all the boats had shot their

nets, and Christie went alongside his Lordship’s
cutter; he asked her many questions about
herring fishery, to which she gave clear answers,
derived from her father, who had always been
what the fishermen call a lucky fisherman; that
is, he had opened his eyes and judged for
himself.
Lord Ipsden then gave her blue lights to
distribute among the boats, that the first which
caught herring might signal all hands.
This was done, and all was expectation.
Eleven o'clock came — no signal from any
boat.
Christie became anxious; at last she went
round to the boats; found the boys all asleep,
except the baddish boy; waked them up, and
made them all haul in their first net. The
nets came in as black as ink, no sign of a
herring
There was but one opinion; there was no
herring at Inch Keith; they had not been there
this seven years.
At last, Flucker, to whom she came in turn,
Christie Johnstone.

told her he was going into two fathom water,
where he would let out the bladders and drop
the nets on their cursed backs.
A strong remonstrance was made by Christie,
but the baddish boy insisted that he had an
equal right in all her nets, and setting his sail,
he ran into shoal water.
Christie began to be sorrowful: instead of
making money she was going to throw it away,
and the neer-do-weel Flucker would tear six nets
from the ropes.
Flucker hauled down his sail, and unstepped
his mast in two fathom water; but he was not
such a fool as to risk his six nets; he devoted
one to his experiment, and did it well; he let
out his bladder line a fathom, so that one half
his net would literally be higgledy-piggledy with
the rocks, unless the fish were there en masse.
No long time was required.
In five minutes he began to haul in the net;
first, the boys hauled in the rope, and then the
net began to approach the surface. Flucker
looked anxiously down, the other lads incredu-

lously; suddenly they all gave a yell of triumph
—an appearance of silver and lightning mixed,
had glanced up from the bottom; in came the
first two yards of the net — there were three
herrings in it. These three proved Flucker's point
as well as three million.
They hauled in the net. Before they had a
quarter of it in, the net came up to the surface,
and the sea was alive with molten silver. The
upper half of the net was empty, but the lower
half was one solid mass of fish.
The boys could not find a mesh, they had
nothing to handle but fish.
At this moment the easternmost boat showed
a blue light
“The fish are rising," said Flucker, “we'll na
risk nae mair nets."
Soon after this a sort of song was heard from
the boat that had showed a light. Flucker, who
had got his net in, ran down to her, and found,
as he suspected, that the boys had not power to
draw the weight of fish over the gunwale.
They were singing, as sailors do, that they

might all pull together; he gave them two of his
crew, and ran down to his own skipper.
The said skipper gave him four men.
Another blue light!
Christie and her crew came a little nearer the
boats, and shot twelve nets.
The yachtsmen entered the sport with zeal,
so did his Lordship.
The boats were all full in a few minutes, and
nets still out.
Then Flucker began to fear some of these
nets would sink with the weight of fish; for the
herring die after a while in a net, and a dead
herring sinks.
What was to be done?
They got two boats alongside the cutter, and
unloaded them into her, as well as they could;
but before they could half do this the other boats
hailed them.
They came to one of them; the boys were
struggling with a thing which no stranger would
have dreamed was a net.
Imagine a white sheet, fifty feet long, var-

nished with red-hot silver; there were twenty
barrels in this single net. By dint of fresh hands
they got half of her in, and then the meshes be-
gan to break; the men leaned over the gunwale,
and put their arms round blocks and masses of
fish, and so flung them on board; and the cod-
fish and dog-fish snapped them almost out of the
men's hands, like tigers.
At last, they came to a net, which was a
double wall of herring; it had been some time in
the water, and many of the fish were dead; they
tried their best, but it was impracticable; they
laid hold of the solid herring, and when they
lifted up a hundred weight clear of the water,
away it all tore, and sank back again.
They were obliged to cut away this net, with
twenty pounds sterling in her. They cut away
the twine from the head-ropes, and net and fish
went to the bottom.
All hands were now about the cutter; Christie's
nets were all strong, and new; they had been
some time in the water; in hauling them up her

side, quantities of fish fell out of the net into the
water, but there were enough left.
She averaged twelve barrels a net.
Such of the yawls as were not quite full,
crept between the cutter and the nets, and caught
all they wanted.
The projector of this fortunate speculation
suddenly announced that she was very sleepy.
Flucker rolled her up in a sail, and she slept
the sleep of infancy on board her cutter.
When she awoke it was seven o'clock in the
morning, and her cutter was creeping with a
smart breeze, about two miles an hour, a mile
from Newhaven pier.
The yacht had returned to Granton, and the
yawls, very low in the water, were creeping along
like snails, with both sails set.
The news was in Edinburgh long before they
landed.
They had been discerned under Inch Keith
at the dawn.
And the manner of their creeping along, when
there was such a breeze, told the tale at once to

the keen, experienced eyes that are sure to be
scanning the sea.
Donkey carts came rattling down from the
capital.
Merchants came pelting down to Newhaven
pier.
The whole story began to be put together by
bits, and comprehended.
Old Johnstone's cleverness was recalled to
mind.
The few fishermen left at Newhaven were
ready to kill themselves.
Their wives were ready to do the same good
office for La Johnstone.
Four Irish merchants agreed to work to-
gether, and to make a show of competition, the
better to keep the price down within bounds.
It was hardly fair, four men against one in-
nocent unguarded female.
But this is a wicked world.
Christie landed, and proceeded to her own
house; on the way she was met by Jean Carnie,
who debarrassed her of certain wrappers, and a

handkerchief she had tied round her head, and
informed her she was the pride of Newhaven.
She next met these four little merchants, one
after another.
And since we ought to dwell as little as pos-
sible upon scenes in which unguarded innocence
is exposed to artful conspiracies, we will put a
page or two into the brute form of dramatic
dialogue, and so sail through it quicker.
Ist Merchant. “Where are ye going, Meggie?”
Christie Johnstone. “If ony body asks ye,
say ye dinna ken.”
Ist Mer. “Will ye sell your fish?”
Christie. “Suner than gie them.”
Ist Mer. “You will be asking fifteen shillin'
the cran."
Christie. “And ten to that.”
Ist Mer. “Good morning.”
2nd Mer. “Would he not go over fifteen
shillings? Oh the thief o' the world!—I'll give
sixteen.”
3rd Mer. “But I'll give eighteen.”

my girl.”

3rd Mer. “You will keep them till Sunday
week and sell their bones.”
[Exeunt the three Merchants.
Enter 4th Merchant.
4th Mer. “Are your fish sold!—I'll give six-
teen shillings.”
Christie. “I'm seekin twenty-five, an' I'm
offered eighteen."
4th Mer. “Take it.”

Christie. “They hae putten their heads

Here Flucker came up to her, and told her
there was a Leith merchant looking for her.
“And Custy,” said he, “there's plenty wind get-ing
up, your fish will be sair hashed; put them off
your hands, I rede ye.”
Christie. “Ay, lad!—Flucker, hide, an' when
I play my hand sae, ye'll run in an' cry, 'Cirsty,
the Irishman will gie ye twenty-two schellin the
cran.'"

Flucker. “Ye ken mair than's in the cate-
cheesm, for as releegious as ye are.”
The Leith merchant was Mr. Miller, and this
is the way he worked.
Miller (in a mellifluous voice). “Are ye no
fatigued, my deear?
Christie (affecting fatigue). “Indeed, sir, and
I am.”
Miller: “Shall I have the pleasure to deal
wi' ye?”
Christie. “If it's your pleasure, sir. I'm
seekin' twenty-five schellin.”
Miller (pretending not to hear). “As you are
a beginner, I must offer fair; twenty schellin you
shall have, and that's three shillings above Dun-
bar.”
Christie. “Wad ye even carted herrin with
my fish caller fra the sea? and Dunbar—oh fine!
ye ken there's nae herrin at Dunbar the morn;
this is the Dunbar schule that slipped westward:
I'm the mairket, ye'll hae to buy o' me or gang
to your bed-(Here she signalled to Flucker). I'll
no be oot o' mine lang.”

Enter Flucker hastily, crying: “Cirsty, the
Irishman will gie ye twenty-two schellin.”
“I'll no tak it,” said Christie.
“They are keen to hae them,” said Flucker;
and hastily retired, as if to treat farther with the
small merchants.
On this Mr. Miller, pretending to make for
Leith, said, carelessly, “Twenty-three shillings, or
they are not for me."
“Tak the cutter's freight at a hundre' cran,
an' I'm no caring,” said Christie.
“They are mine!” said Mr. Miller, very
sharply. “How much shall I give you the day?"
“Auchty pund, sir, if you please—the lave
when you like; I ken ye, Mr. Miller."
Whilst counting her the notes, the purchaser
said slily to her:-
“There's more than a hundred cran in the
cutter, my woman.”
“A little, sir," replied the vendor; “but ere I
could count them till ye by baskets, they would lose
seven or eight cran in book,* your gain, my loss.”

“You are a vara intelligent young person,"
said Mr. Miller, gravely.
“Ye had measured them wi' your walking-
stick, sir; there's just ae scale ye didna wipe off,
though ye are a carefu’ mon, Mr. Miller; sae I
laid the bait for ye, an' fine ye took it."
Miller took out his snuff-box, and tapping it,
said:
“Will ye go into partnership with me, my
dear?”
“Ay, sir!” was the reply. “When I'm aulder
an' ye're younger.”
At this moment, the four merchants, believing
it useless to disguise their co-operation, returned
to see what could be done.
“We shall give you a guinea a barrel.”
“Why ye offered her twenty-two shillings
before.”
“That we never did, Mr. Miller."
“Haw! haw!" went Flucker.
Christie looked down and blushed.
Eyes met eyes, and without a word spoken all
was comprehended, and silently approved. There

was no nonsense uttered about morality in con-
nection with dealing.
Mr. Miller took an enormous pinch of snuff,
and drew for the benefit of all present the follow-
ing inference:
MR. MILLER'S APOTHEGM.
“Friends and neighbours! when a man's heed
is grey with age and thoucht (pause)—he's just fit
to go to schule to a young lass o' twenty.”
There was a certain middle-aged fishwife,
called Beeny Liston, a tenant of Christie John-
stones; she had not paid her rent for some time,
and she had not been pressed for it; whether this,
or the whisky she was in the habit of taking,
rankled in her mind, certain it is she had always
an ill word for her landlady.
She now met her, envied her success, and
called out in a coarse tone,
“Oh, ye're a gallant quean; ye'll be waur than
ever the noo."
“What's wrang, if ye please?” said the John-
stone, sharply.

Reader, did you ever see two fallow bucks
commence a duel?
They strut round, eight yards apart, tails up,
look carefully another way to make the other
think it all means nothing, and being both
equally sly, their horns come together as if by
concert.
Even so commenced this duel of tongues be-
tween these two heroines.
Beeny Liston, looking at everybody but
Christie, addressed the natives who were congre-
gating, thus:-
“Did ever ye hear o' a decent lass taking the
herrin' oot o’the men's mooths—is yon a woman's
pairt I'm asking ye?"
On this, Christie looking carefully at all the
others except Beeny, inquired with an air of
simple curiosity:
“Can onybody tell me wha Liston Carnie's
drunken wife is speakin till? no to ony decent
lass though. Na! ye ken she wad na hae th’im-
pudence!”
"Oh, ye ken fine I'm speakin till yoursel'."


## p. 207 (#211) ############################################

Here the horns clashed together.
“To me, woman? (with admirably acted sur-
prise). Oo, ay! it will be for the twa years' rent
you're awin me. Giest!”
Beeny Liston. “Ye're just the impudentest
girrl i' the toon, an' ye hae proved it the day"
(her arms akimbo).
Christie (arms akimbo). “Me, impudent? how
daur ye speak against my charackter, that's kenned
for decency o' baith sides the Firrth.”
Beeny (contemptuously). "Oh, ye're sly enough
to beguile the men, but we ken ye.”
Christie. “I'm no sly—and (drawing near
and hissing the words) I'm no like the woman
Jean an' I saw in Rose Street, dead drunk on
the causeway, while her mon was working for her
at sea. If ye're no ben your hoose in ae minute,
I'll say that will gar Liston Cairnie fling ye ower

he knows exactly with what a gesture and tone
the Johnstone uttered this word.
Beeny (in a voice of whining surprise). “Hech!
what a spite Flucker Johnstone's dochter has
taen against us."
Christie. “Scairt!" ...
Beeny (in a coaxing voice, and moving a step).
“Aweel! what's a' your paession, my boenny
woman?”
Christie. “Scairt!”
Beeny retired before the thunder and lightning
of indignant virtue.
Then all the fishboys struck up a dismal
chant of victory.
"Yoo-hoo-Custy's won the day— Beeny's
scair-tit,” going up on the last syllable.
Christie moved slowly away towards her own
house, but before she could reach the door she
began to whimper-little fool.
Thereat chorus of young Athenians chanted:
“Yu-hoo! come back, Beeny, ye'll maybe win
yet. Custy's away gree-tin,” (going up on the last
syllable).

“I'm no greetin, ye rude bairns,” said Christie,
bursting into tears, and retiring as soon as she
had effected that proof of her philosophy.
It was about four hours later; Christie had
snatched some repose. The wind, as Flucker
prognosticated, had grown to a very heavy gale,
and the Firth was brown and boiling.
Suddenly a clamour was heard on the shore,
and soon after a fishwife made her appearance,
with rather a singular burden.
Her husband, ladies; rien que cela.
She had him by the scruf of the neck; he
was dos-d-dos, with his booted legs kicking in the
air, and his fists making warlike but idle demon-
strations, and his mouth uttering ineffectual bad
language.
This worthy had been called a coward by
Sandy Liston, and being about to fight with him,
and get thrashed, his wife had whipped him up,
and carried him away; she now flung him down,
at some risk to his equilibrium.
“Ye are not fit to feicht wi' Sandy Liston,"
said she; “if ye are for feichtin, here's for ye.”
Christie Johnstone.

As a comment to this proposal, she tucked
up the sleeves of her short gown. He tried to
run by her; she caught him by the bosom, and
gave him a violent push, that sent him several
paces backwards; he looked half fierce, half
astounded; ere he could quite recover himself,
his little servant forced a pipe into his hand, and
he smoked contented and peaceable.
Before tobacco the evil passions fall, they
tell me.
The cause of this quarrel soon explained it-
self; up came Sandy Liston, cursing and swear-
ing
“What! ye hae gotten till yer wife's; that's
the place for ye;—to say there's a brig in dis-
tress, and ye'll let her go on the rocks under
your noses: but what are ye afraid o'? there's na.
danger?”
“Nae danger!” said one of the reproached,
“are ye fou?”
“Ye are fou wi' fear yoursel'; of a the beasts
that crawl the airth, a cooward is the ugliest, I
think.”

“The wifes will no let us,” said one, sulkily.
, “It's the woman in your hairts that keeps ye,”
roared Sandy, hoarsely; “curse ye, ye are sure to
dee ane day, and ye are sure to be ——! (a past
participle) soon or late, what signifies when? Oh!
curse the hour ever I was born amang sic a
cooardly crew.” (Gun at sea.)
“There!"
“She speaks till ye, hersel; she cries for
maircy; to think that of a that hear ye cry,
Alexander Liston is the only mon mon enough
to answer.” (Gun.)
“You are mistaken, Mr. Alexander Liston,"
said a clear, smart voice, whose owner had
mingled unobserved with the throng; "there are
always men to answer such occasions; now, my
lads, your boats have plenty of beam, and well
handled, should live in any sea; who volunteers
with Alexander Liston and me?"
The speaker was Lord Ipsden.
The fishwives of Newhaven, more accustomed
to measure men than poor little Lady Barbara
Sinclair, saw in this man what, in point of fact,

he was, a cool daring devil, than whom none
more likely to lead men into mortal danger, or
pull them through it, for that matter.
They recognized their natural enemy, and
collected together against him, like hens at the
sight of a hawk.
“And would you really entice our men till
their death?”
“My life's worth as much as theirs, I sup-
pose.”
“Na! your life! it's na worth a button; when
you dee, your next kin will dance, and wha’ll
greet? but our men hae wife and bairns to look
till.” (Gun at sea.)
“Ah! I didn't look at it in that light,” said
Lord Ipsden. He then demanded paper and ink;
Christie Johnstone, who had come out of her
house, supplied it from her treasures, and this
cool hand actually began to convey a hundred
and fifty thousand pounds away, upon a sheet of
paper blowing in the wind; when he had named
his residuary legatee, and disposed of certain
large bequests, he came to the point-

“Christie Johnstone, what can these people
live on? two hundred a year? living is cheap here
-confound the wind!”
“Twa hundred! Fifty! Vile Count."
“Don't call me Vile Count. I am Ipsden,
and my name's Richard. Now, then, be smart
with your names."
Three men stepped forward, gave their names,
had their widows provided for, and went for their
sou’westers, &c.
“Stay,” said Lord Ipsden, writing. “To Chris-
tina Johnstone, out of respect for her character,
one thousand pounds."
“Richard! dinna gang," cried Christie, "oh!
dinna gang, dinna gang, dinna gang; it's no your
business.”
“Will you lend me your papa's Flushing
jacket and sou’wester, my dear? If I was sure to
be drowned, I'd go!"
Christie ran in for them.
In the meantime, discomposed by the wind,
and by feelings whose existence neither he, nor
I, nor any one, suspected, Saunders, after a sore

struggle between the frail man and the perfect
domestic, blurted out:-
“My Lord, I beg your Lordship’s pardon, but
it blows tempestuous.”
“That is why the brig wants us,” was the
reply.
“My Lord, I beg your Lordship’s pardon,"
whimpered Saunders.
“But oh! my Lord, don't go; it's all very well
for fishermen to be drowned; it is their business,
but not yours, my Lord.”
“Saunders, help me on with this coat.”
Christie had brought it.
“Yes, my Lord,” said Saunders, briskly, his
second nature reviving.
His Lordship, whilst putting on the coat and
hat, undertook to cool Mr. Saunders's aristocratic
prejudices.
“Should Alexander Liston and I be drowned,"
said he, coolly, “when our bones come ashore,
you will not know which are the fisherman's, and
which the Viscounts.” So saying, he joined the
enterprize.

stone, and she retired for that purpose.
Saunders, with a heavy heart, to the nearest
tavern, to prepare an account of what he called
“Heroism in high life," large letters, and the
usual signs of great astonishment ! ! ! ! ! ! for

The commander of the distressed vessel had
been penny-wise. He had declined a pilot off
the Isle of May, trusting to fall in with one close
to the port of Leith; but a heavy gale and fog
had come on; he knew himself in the vicinity of
dangerous rocks; and, to make matters worse, his
ship, old and sore battered by a long and stormy
voyage, was leaky; and unless a pilot came along-
side, his fate would be, either to founder, or run
upon the rocks, where he must expect to go to
pieces in a quarter of an hour.
The Newhaven boat lay in comparatively
smooth water, on the lee side of the pier.
Our adventurers got into her, stepped the
mast, set a small sail, and ran out! Sandy

belaying-pin, and whenever a larger wave than
usual came at them, he slacked the sheet, and
the boat losing her way, rose gently, like a cork,
upon seas that had seemed about to swallow
her.
But seen from the shore it was enough to
make the most experienced wince; so completely
was this wooden shell lost to sight, as she de-
scended from a wave, that each time her re-
appearance seemed a return from the dead.
The weather was misty — the boat was soon
lost sight of; the story remains ashore.

CHAPTER XIV.
It was an hour later; the natives of the New
Town had left the pier, and were about their
own doors, when three Buckhaven fishermen
came slowly up from the pier; these men had
arrived in one of their large fishing-boats which
defy all weather.
The men came slowly up; their petticoat
trousers were drenched, and their neck-hand-
kerchiefs and hair were wet with spray.
At the foot of the New Town they stood still
and whispered to each other.
There was something about these men that
drew the eye of Newhaven upon them.
In the first place, a Buckhaven man rarely
communicates with natives of Newhaven, except
at the pier, where he brings in his cod and ling
from the deep sea; flings them out like stones,
and sells them to the fishwives; then up sail and
away for Fifeshire.


## p. 218 (#222) ############################################

218
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
But these men evidently came ashore to speak
to some one in the town.
They whispered together; something appeared
to be proposed and demurred to; but at last two
went slowly back towards the pier, and the eldest
remained, with a fisherman's long mackintosh
coat in his hand which the others had given him
as they left him.
With this in his hand, the Buckhaven fisher-
man stood in an irresolute posture; he looked
down, and seemed to ask himself what course he
should take.
“What's wrang?” said Jean Carnie, who, with
her neighbours, had observed the men; “I wish
yon man may na hae ill news.”
“What ill news wad he hae?" replied another.
“Are ony freends of Liston Carnie here?” said
the fisherman.
“The wife's awa' to Granton, Beeny Liston
they ca’ her — there's his house," added Jean,
pointing up the row.
“Ay," said the fisherman, “I ken he lived
there."


## p. 219 (#223) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
219
“Lived there!” cried Christie Johnstone; "oh!
what's this?”
“Freends," said the man, gravely, “his boat
is driving keel uppermost in Kircauldy Bay;-we
passed her near enough to read the name upon
her.”
“But the men will have won to shore, please
God?"
The fisherman shook his head.
“She'll hae coupit a mile wast Inch Keith,
an' the tide rinning aff the island an' a heavy
sea gaun. This is a' Newhaven we'll see of them
(holding up the coat) till they rise to the top in
three weeks' time.”
The man then took the coat, which was now
seen to be drenched with water, and hung it up
on a line not very far from its unfortunate owner's
house: then, in the same grave and subdued tone
in which he had spoken all along, he said, “We
are sorry to bring siccan a tale into your toon,"
and slowly moved off to rejoin his comrades,
who had waited for him at no great distance.
They then passed through the Old Town, and in

five minutes the calamity was known to the whole
place.
After the first stupor, the people in the New
Town collected into knots, and lamented their
hazardous calling, and feared for the lives of
those that had just put to sea in this fatal gale
for the rescue of strangers, and the older ones
failed not to match this present sorrow with
others within their recollection.
In the middle of this, Flucker Johnstone came
hastily in from the Old Town, and told them he
had seen the wife, Beeny Liston, coming through
from Granton.
The sympathy of all was instantly turned in
this direction.
“She would hear the news.”
“It would fall on her like a thunder-clap."
“What would become of her?”
Every eye was strained towards the Old Town,
and soon the poor woman was seen about to
emerge from it; but she was walking in her usual
way, and they felt she could not carry her person
so if she knew.


## p. 221 (#225) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
221
At the last house she was seen to stop and
speak to a fisherman and his wife that stood at
their own door.
“They are telling her," was then the cry.
Beeny Liston then proceeded on her way.
Every eye was strained.
No! they had not told her.
She came gaily on, the unconscious object of
every eye and every heart.
The hands of this people were hard, and
their tongues rude, but they had shrunk from
telling this poor woman of her bereavement-
they thought it kinder she should know it under
her own roof from her friends or neighbours,
than from comparative strangers.
She drew near her own door.
And now a knot collected round Christie John-
stone, and urged her to undertake the sad task.
“You that speak sa learned, Christie, ye
should tell her; we daur na.”
“How can I tell her?” said Christie, turning
pale. “How will I tell her? I'se try.”
She took one trembling step to meet the woman.


## p. 222 (#226) ############################################

222
CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Beeny's eye fell upon her.
“Ay! here's the Queen o’ Newhaven,” cried
she, in a loud and rather coarse voice. “The
men will hae ta leave the place now y'are turned
fisherman, I daur say."
“Oh, dinna fleicht on me! dinna fleicht on
me!” cried Christie, trembling.
“Maircy on us,” said the other, “auld Flucker
Johnstone's dochter turned humble. What next?”
“I'm vexed for speaking back till ye the
morn,” faltered Christie.
“Hett,” said the woman, carelessly, “let yon
flea stick i the wa.' I fancy I began on ye.
Aweel, Cirsty,” said she, falling into a friendlier
tone; “it's the place we live in spoils us—New-
haven's an impudent toon, as sure as deeth.
“I passed through the Auld Toon the noo-
a place I never speak in; an if they did na
glower at me as I had been a strange beast.
“They cam' to their very doors to glower at
me; if ye'll believe me, I thoucht shame.
“At the hinder end my paassion got up, and
I faced a wife East-by, and I said, “What gars

ye glower at me that way, ye ignorant woman?'
ye would na think it, she answered like honey
itsel — “I'm askin' your paardon,' says she; and
her mon by her side said 'Gang hame to your
ain hoose, my woman, and Gude help ye, and
help us a’ at our need,' the decent mon. “It's
just there, I'm for,' said I, 'to get my mon his
breakfast.'"
All who heard her drew their breath with dif-
ficulty.
The woman then made for her own house,
but in going up the street she passed the wet
coat hanging on the line.
She stopped directly.
They all trembled — they had forgotten the
coat—it was all over; the coat would tell the
tale.
“Aweel,” said she, “I could sweer that's Liston
Carnie's coat, a droukit wi’ the rain;" then she
looked again at it, and added, slowly, “if I did'na
ken he has his away wi' him at the piloting.”
And in another moment she was in her own house,
leaving them all standing there half stupefied.

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Christie had indeed endeavoured to speak,
but her tongue had cloven to her mouth.
Whilst they stood looking at one another, and
at Beeny Liston's door, a voice that seemed in-
credibly rough, loud, and harsh, jarred upon
them; it was Sandy Liston, who came in from
Leith, shouting-
“Fifty pounds for salvage, lasses! is na thaat
better than staying cooard-like aside the women?"
“Whisht! whisht!” cried Christie. “We are
in heavy sorrow; puir Liston Cairnie and his son
Willy lie deed at the bottom o' the Firrth.”
“Gude help us!” said Sandy, and his voice
sank.
“An', oh, Sandy, the wife does na ken, and
it's hairt-breaking to see her, and hear her; we
canna get her tell’t; ye’re the auldest mon here;
ye'll tell her, will ye no, Sandy?".
“No, me, that I will not!”
“Oh, yes; ye are kenned for your stoot heart,
an' coorage; ye come fra facing the sea an' wind
in a bit yawl.”
“The sea and the wind,” cried he, contemptu-

ously; "they be --, I'm used wi' them; but to
look a woman i' the face, an' tell her her mon
and her son are drowned since yestreen, I hae
na coorage for that.”
All further debate was cut short by the entrance
of one who came expressly to discharge the sad
duty all had found so difficult. It was the Pres-
byterian clergyman of the place; he waved them
back. “I know, I know," said he, solemnly.
“Where is the wife?"
She came out of her house at this moment, as
it happened, to purchase something at Drysale's
shop, which was opposite.
“Beeny," said the clergyman, “I have sorrowful
tidings.”
“Tell me them, sir," said she, unmoved. “Is
it a deeth?” added she, quietly.
“It is!-death, sudden and terrible; in your
own house I must tell it you,-(and may God
show me how to break it to her).”
He entered her house.
“Aweel,” said the woman to the others, “it
maun be some far awa cousin, or the like, for

Liston an me hae nae near freends. Meg, ye idle
hizzy,” screamed she to her servant, who was one
of the spectators, “your pat is no on yet; div ye
think the men will no be hungry when they come
in fra the sea?”
. “They will never hunger nor thirst ony mair,"
said Jean, solemnly, as the bereaved woman entered
her own door.
There ensued a listless and fearful silence.
Every moment some sign of bitter sorrow was
expected to break forth from the house, but
none came; and amidst the expectation and silence
the waves dashed louder and louder, as it seemed,
against the dyke, conscious of what they had done.
At last, in a moment, a cry of agony arose,
so terrible that all who heard it trembled, and
more than one woman shrieked in return, and
fled from the door; at which, the next moment,
the clergyman stood alone, collected, but pale,
and beckoned. Several women advanced.
“One woman,” said he.
Jean Carnie was admitted; and after a while
· returned.

“She is come to hersel',” whispered she; “I
am no weel mysel.” And she passed into her
own house.
Then Flucker crept to the door to see.
"Oh, dinna spie on her,” cried Christie.
“Oh, yes, Flucker,” said many voices.
“He is kneelin'," said Flucker. “He has her
hand, to gar her kneel tae,-she winna,-she
does na see him, nor hear 'him; he will hae her.
He has won her to kneel,- he is prayin', an'
greetin aside her I canna see noo, my een's
blinded.”
“He's a gude mon,” said Christie. “Oh, what
wad we do without the ministers.”
Sandy Liston had been leaning sorrowfully
against the wall of the next house, he now
broke out.
“An auld shipmate at the whale fishing!!! an’
noow we'll never lift the dredging sang thegither
again, in yon dirty detch that's droowned him; I
maun hae whiskey, an' forget it a?”
He made for the spirit-shop like a madman;
but ere he could reach the door a hand was laid

on him lise a vice. Christie Johnstone had liter-
ally sprung on him. She hated this horrible
vice,—had often checked him; and now it seemed
so awful a moment for such a sin, that she forgot
the wild and savage nature of the man who had
struck his own sister, and seriously hurt her, but
a month before,—she saw nothing but the vice
and its victim, and she seized him by the collar,
with a grasp from which he in vain attempted to
shake himself loose.
“No! ye'll no gang there at siccan a time.”
“Hands off, ye daft jaud,” roared he, "or
there'll be another deeth i' the toon."
At the noise Jean Carnie ran in.
“Let the ruffian go,” cried she, in dismay.
“Oh, Christie, dinna put your hand on a lion's
mane."
“Yes, I'll put my hand on his mane, ere I'll
let him mak a beast o' himsel.”
“Sandy, if ye hurt her, I'll find twenty lads
that will lay ye deed at her feet.”
“Haud your whisht,” said Christie, very sharply,
“he's no to be threetened.”

Sandy Liston, black and white with rage,
ground his teeth together, and said, lifting his
hand, “Wull ye let me go, or must I tak my
hand till ye?”
“No!” said Christie, “I'll no let ye go, sae
look me all the face; Flucker's dochter, your auld
comrade, that saved your life at Holy Isle,--think
Óhis face,—an' look in mines,—an' strike me!!!!”
They glared on one another,—he, fiercely and
unsteadily; she, firmly and proudly.
Jean Cairnie said afterwards, “her eyes were
like coals of fire.”
“Ye are doing what nae mon i' the toon daur;
ye are a bauld, unwise lassy."
“It's you mak me bauld,” was the instant
reply. “I saw ye face the mad sea, to save a
ship fra the rocks, an' will I fear a mon's hand,
when I can save”-(rising to double her height)
"my feyther's auld freend fra the puir mon's
enemy, the enemy o' mankind, the cursed, cursed
drink. Oh! Sandy Liston, hoow could ye think
to put an enemy in your mooth to steal awa your
brains!"

“This's no Newhaven chat: wha lairns ye sic

“A deed mon!"
“I would na wonder, y'are no canny; she's
ta’en a'the poower oot o my body, I think.”
Then suddenly descending to a tone of abject
submission, "What's your pleesure, Flucker John-
stone's dochter?”
She instantly withdrew the offensive grasp, and
leaning affectionately on his shoulder, she melted
into her rich Ionic tones.
"It's no a time for sin; ye'll sit by my fire,
an' get your dinner; a bonny haggis hae I for
you an' Flucker, an’ we'll improve this sorrowfu’

"I'se gang, my lamb," said the rough man,
quite subdued; “I daur say whiskey will no pass
my teeth the day.”
And so he went quietly away, and sat by
Christie's fireside.
Jean and Christie went towards the boats.
Jean, after taking it philosophically for half a
minute, began to whimper.
“What's wrang?” said Christie.
“Div ye think my hairt's no in my mooth wi'
you gripping yon fierce robber.”
Here a young fishwife, with a box in her
hand, who had followed them, pulled Jean by the
coats.
"Hets,” said Jean, pulling herself free.
The child then, with a pertinacity these little
animals have, pulled Christie's coats.
“Hets,” said Christie, freeing herself more
gently.
“Ye suld mairry Van Amburgh," continued
Jean; “ye are just such a lass as he is a lad.”
Christie smiled proudly, was silent, but did
not disown the comparison.

by pulling, opened her box, and saying, “Lasses,

tail, and set him in the midst for friendly ad.
miration.
“I dinna like it—I dinna like it!” screamed
Christie; “Jean, put it away—it fears me, Jean!"
This she uttered (her eyes almost starting from
her head with unaffected terror) at the distance
of about eight yards, whither she had arrived in
two bounds that would have done no discredit to
an antelope.
“Het,” said Jean, uneasily, "hae ye coowed
yon savage, to be scared at the wee beastie?”
Christie, looking askaunt at the animal, ex-
plained-
“A moose is an awesome beast-it's no like
a mon!” and still her eye was fixed by fascination
upon the four-footed danger
Jean, who had not been herself in genuine
tranquillity, now turned savagely on the little
Wombwelless: “An' div ye really think ye are to

awa ye go, the pair o'ye.”
These severe words, and a smart push, sent
the poor little biped off roaring, with the string
over her shoulder, recklessly dragging the terrific
quadruped, which made fruitless grabs at the
shingle. — Moral. Don't terrify bigger folk than
yourself.
Christie had intended to go up to Edinburgh
with her eighty pounds; but there was more
trouble in store this eventful day.
Flucker went out after dinner, and left her
with Sandy Liston, who was in the middle of a
yarn, when some one came running in and told
her, Flucker was at the pier crying for her. She
inquired what was the matter — "Come, an' ye'll
see," was all the answer. She ran down to the
pier. There was poor Flucker, lying on his back;
he had slipped from the pier into a boat that lay
alongside; the fall was considerable: for a minute
he had been insensible, then he had been dread-
fully sick, and now he was beginning to feel his
hurt; he was in great anguish; nobody knew the

extent of his injuries; he would let nobody touch
him; all his cry was for his sister. At last she
came; they all made way for her; he was crying
for her as she came up.
“My bairn! my bairn!" cried she, and the
poor little fellow smiled, and tried to raise him-
self towards her.
She lifted him gently in her arms—she was
powerful, and affection made her stronger; she
carried him in her arms all the way home, and
laid him on her own bed. Willy Liston, her dis-
carded suitor, ran for the surgeon. There were
no bones broken, but his ancle was severely
sprained, and he had a terrible bruise on the
loins; his dark, ruddy face was streaked and
pale; but he never complained after he found
himself at home.
Christie hovered round him, a ministering
angel, applying to him with a light and loving
hand whatever could ease his pain; and he
watched her with an expression she had never
noticed in his eye before.
At last, after two hours' silence, he made

her sit in full view, and then he spoke to her;
and what think you was the subject of his dis-
course?
He turned to and told her, one after another,
without preface, all the loving things she had
done to him ever since he was five years old.
Poor boy, he had never shown much gratitude,
but he had forgotten nothing, literally nothing.
Christie was quite overcome with this unex-
pected trait; she drew him gently to her bosom,
and wept over him; and it was sweet to see a
brother and sister treat each other almost like
lovers, as these two began to do they watched
each other's eye so tenderly.
This new care kept the sister in her own
house all the next day; but towards the evening,
Jean, who knew her other anxiety, slipped in and
offered to take her place for an hour by Flucker's
side; at the same time she looked one of those
signals which are too subtle for any but woman
to understand.
Christie drew her aside, and learned that Gatty
and his mother were just coming through from

Leith; Christie ran for her eighty pounds, placed
them in her bosom, cast a hasty glance at a
looking-glass, little larger than an oyster-shell,
and ran out.
“Hech! What pleased the auld wife will be
to see he has a lass that can mak auchty pund
in a morning.”
This was Christie's notion.
At sight of them she took out the bank-notes,
and with eyes glistening and cheeks flushing, she
cried-
“Oh, Chairles, ye'll no gang to jail — I hae
the siller!” and she offered him the money with
both hands, and a look of tenderness and modesty
that embellished human nature.
Ere he could speak, his mother put out her
hand, and not rudely, but very coldly repelling
Christie's arm, said in a freezing manner--
“We are much obliged to you, but my son's
own talents have rescued him from his little em-
barrassment.”
“A nobleman has bought my picture,” said
Gatty, proudly.


## p. 237 (#241) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
237
“For one hundred and fifty pounds,” said
the old lady; meaning to mark the contrast be-
tween that sum and what Christie had in her
hand.
Christie remained like a statue, with her arms
extended and the bank-notes in her hand; her
features worked-she had much ado not to cry;
and any one that had known the whole story,
and seen this unmerited repulse, would have felt
for her; but her love came to her aid, she put
the notes in her bosom, sighed and said —
“I would hae likeit to hae been the first ye
ken, but I'm real pleased."
“But, mother,” said Gatty, “it was very kind
of Christie all the same. Oh, Christie!” said he,
in a tone of despair.
At this kind word Christie's fortitude was sore
tried; she turned away her head;—she was far
too delicate to let them know who had sent Lord
Ipsden to buy the picture.
Whilst she turned away, Mrs. Gatty said in
her son's ear-
“Now, I have your solemn promise to do it

here, and at once; you will find me on the beach
behind these boats—do it.”
The reader will understand that during the
last few days, Mrs. Gatty had improved her ad-
vantage, and that Charles had positively con-
sented to obey her; the poor boy was worn out
with the struggle—he felt he must have peace or
die; he was thin and pale, and sudden twitches
came over him; his temperament was not fit for
such a battle: and it is to be observed, nearly all
the talk was on one side. He had made one ex-
piring struggle,-he described to his mother an
artist's nature, his strength, his weakness,-he be-
sought her not to be a slave to general rules, but
to inquire what sort of a companion the indi-
vidual Gatty needed: he lashed with true but
brilliant satire the sort of wife his mother was
ready to see him saddled with-a stupid, unsym-
pathizing creature, whose ten children would, by
nature's law, be also stupid, and so be a weight
on him till his dying day. He painted Christie
Johnstone, mind and body, in words as true and
bright as his colours; he showed his own weak

points, her strong ones, and how the latter would
fortify the former.
He displayed, in short, in one minute more
intellect than his mother had exhibited in sixty
years; and that done, with all his understanding,
wit, and eloquence, he succumbed like a child,
to her stronger will —he promised to break with
Christie Johnstone.
When Christie had recovered her composure
and turned round to her companions, she found
herself alone with Charles..
“Chairles,” said she, gravely.
“Christie,” said he, uneasily.
“Your mother does na like me. Oh! ye need
na deny it; and we are na together as we used
to be, my lad.”
“She is prejudiced, but she has been the best
of mothers to me, Christie.”
“Aweel.”
“Circumstances compel me to return to Eng-
land.”
(Ah, coward! anything but the real truth!)
“Awęel, Chairles, it will no be for lang."

“I don't know; you will not be so unhappy
as I shall—at least I hope not.”
“How do ye ken that?”
“Christie, do you remember the first night we
danced together?"
“Ay."
“And we walked in the cool by the sea side,
and I told you the names of the stars, and you
said those were not their real names, but nick-
names we give them here on earth. I loved you
that first night."
“And I fancied you the first time I set eyes
on you.”
“How can I leave you, Christie? What shall
I do?”
“I ken what I shall do," answered Christie,
coolly; then bursting into tears, she added, “I
shall dee! I shall dee!”
“No! you must not say so; at least I will
never love any one but you.”
“An' i'll live as I am a' my days for your
sake. Oh, England! I hae likeit ye sae weel, ye
suld na rob me o' my lad-he's a' the joy I hae!”

"I love you," said Gatty.
“Do you love
me ?"
All the answer was, her head upon his
shoulder.
"I can't do it," thought Gatty, "and I won't!
Christie,” said he, “stay here, don't move from
here." And he dashed among the boats in great
agitation.
He found his mother rather near the scene of
the late conference.
“Mother,” said he, fiercely, like a coward as
he was, “ask me no more, my mind is made up
for ever; I will not do this scoundrelly, heart-
less, beastly, ungrateful action you have been
pushing me to so long."
“Take care, Charles, take care," said the old
woman, trembling with passion, for this was a new
tone for her son to take with her. “You had my
blessing the other day, and you saw what fol-
lowed it; do not tempt me to curse an undutiful,
disobedient, ungrateful son.”
“I must take my chance," said he, desperately;
"for I am under a curse any way! I placed my

and swore she should be my wife: she has my
ring and my oath, and I will not perjure myself
even for my mother.”
“Your ring! Not the ruby ring I gave you
from your dead father's finger — not that! not
that!”
“Yes! yes! I tell you yes! and if he was
alive, and saw her, and knew her goodness, he
would have pity on me, but I have no friend;
you see how ill you have made me, but you have
no pity; I could not have believed it; but since
you have no mercy on me, I will have the more
mercy on myself; I marry her to-morrow, and put
an end to all this shuffling and manoeuvring against
an angel! I am not worthy of her, but I'll marry
her to-morrow. Good-by.”
“Stay!" said the old woman, in a terrible
voice; “before you destroy me and all I have
lived for, and suffered, and pinched for, hear me;
if that ring is not off the hussy's finger in half an
hour, and you my son again, I fall on this sand

“Then God have mercy upon me, for I'll see
the whole creation lost eternally, ere I'll wrong
the only creature that is an ornament to the
world.”
He was desperate; and the weak, driven to
desperation, are more furious than the strong.
It was by Heaven's mercy that neither mother
nor son had time to speak again.
As they faced each other, with flaming eyes
and faces, all self-command gone, about to utter
hasty words, and lay up regret, perhaps for all
their lives to come, in a moment, as if she had
started from the earth, Christie Johnstone stood
between them!
Gatty's words, and still more, his hesitation,
had made her quick intelligence suspect: she had
resolved to know the truth; the boats offered
every facility for listening—she had heard every
word.
She stood between the mother and son.
They were confused, abashed, and the hot
blood began to leave their faces.
She stood erect like a statue, her cheek pale

as ashes, her eyes glittering like basilisks, she
looked at neither of them.
She slowly raised her left hand, she withdrew
a ruby ring from it, and dropped the ring on the
sand between the two.
She turned on her heel, and was gone as she
had come, without a word spoken.
They looked at one another, stupefied at first;
after a considerable pause the stern old woman
stooped, picked up the ring, and in spite of a
certain chill that the young woman's majestic
sorrow had given her, said, placing it on her own
finger, “This is for your wife!!!"
“It will be for my coffin, then,” said her son,
so coldly, so bitterly, and so solemnly, that the
mother's heart began to quake.
“Mother,” said he, calmly, "forgive me, and
accept your son's arm.”
“I will, my son!”
“We are alone in the world now, mother.”
Mrs. Gatty had triumphed, but she felt the
price of her triumph more than her victory. It
had been done in one moment, that for which

245
she had so laboured, and it seemed that had she
spoken long ago to Christie, instead of Charles,
it could have been done at any moment.
Strange to say, for some minutes the mother
felt more uneasy than her son; she was a woman,
after all, and could measure a woman's heart, and
she saw how deep the wound she had given one
she was now compelled to respect.
Charles, on the other hand, had been so
harassed backwards and forwards, that to him
certainty was relief; it was a great matter to be
no longer called upon to decide. His mother
had said, “Part,” and now Christie had said
“Part;" at least the affair was taken out of his
hands, and his first feeling was a heavenly calm.
In this state he continued for about a mile,
and he spoke to his mother about his art, sole
object now; but after the first mile he became
silent, distrait; Christie's pale face, her mortified
air, when her generous offer was coldly repulsed,
filled him with remorse: finally, unable to bear it,
yet not daring to speak, he broke suddenly from
his mother without a word, and ran wildly back

to Newhaven; he looked back only once, and
there stood his mother, pale, with her hands
piteously lifted towards heaven.
By the time he got to Newhaven he was as
sorry for her as for Christie. He ran to the house
of the latter; Flucker and Jean told him she was
on the beach. He ran to the beach! he did not
see her at first, but presently looking back, he
saw her, at the edge of the boats, in company
with a gentleman in a boating dress. He looked
-could he believe his eyes? he saw Christie
Johnstone kiss this man's hand, who then taking
her head gently in his two hands, placed a kiss
upon her brow, whilst she seemed to yield lovingly
to the caress.
Gatty turned faint, sick; for a moment every-
thing swam before his eyes; he recovered himself,
they were gone.
He darted round to intercept them; Christie
had slipped away somewhere; he encountered the
man alone!

CHAPTER XV.
CHRISTIE's situation requires to be explained.
On leaving Gatty and his mother, she went
to her own house. Flucker—who after looking
upon her for years as an inconvenient appendage,
except at dinner-time, had fallen in love with her
in a manner that was half pathetic, half laugh-
able, all things considered—saw by her face she
had received a blow, and raising himself in the
bed, inquired anxiously “What ailed her?”
At these kind words, Christie Johnstone laid
her cheek upon the pillow beside Flucker's, and
said-
“Oh, my laamb, be kind to your puir sister
fra this hoor, for she has naething i' the warld
noo but yoursel.”
Flucker began to sob at this.
Christie could not cry; her heart was like a
lump of lead in her bosom; but she put her arm
round his neck, and at the sight of his sympathy

she panted heavily, but could not shed a tear-
she was sore striken.
Presently Jean came in, and as the poor girl's
head ached as well as her heart, they forced her
to go and sit in the air. She took her creepie
and sat, and looked on the sea; but whether she
looked seaward or landward, all seemed unreal;
not things, but hard pictures of things, some
moving, some still. Life seemed ended-she had
lost her love.
An hour she sat in this miserable trance; she
was diverted into a better, because a somewhat
less dangerous form of grief, by one of those
trifling circumstances that often penetrate to the
human heart, when inaccessible to greater things.
Willie the fiddler and his brother came through
the town, playing as they went, according to cus-
tom; their music floated past Christie's ears like
some drowsy chime, until, all of a sudden, they
struck up the old English air, “Speed the plough.”
Now it was to this tune Charles Gatty had
danced with her their first dance the night they
made acquaintance.

249
Christie listened, lifted up her hands, and
crying-
“Oh, what will I do? what will I do?” burst
into a passion of grief.
She put her apron over her head, and rocked
herself, and sobbed bitterly.
She was in this situation when Lord Ipsden,
who was prowling about, examining the proportions
of the boats, discovered her.
Some one in distress — that was all in his
way.
“Madam!” said he.
She lifted up her head.
"It is Christie Johnstone. I'm so glad; that
is, I'm sorry you are crying, but I'm glad I shall
have the pleasure of relieving you,” and his Lord-
ship began to feel for a cheque-book.
“And div ye really think siller's a cure for
every grief!” said Christie, bitterly.
"I don't know,” said his Lordship; "it has
cured them all as yet.”
“It will na cure me, then!” and she covered
her head with her apron again.

“I am very sorry,” said he; "tell me, (whisper-
ing) what is it? poor little Christie!"
“Dinna speak to me; I think shame; ask Jean.
Oh! Richard, I'll no be lang in this warld!!!”
“Ah!” said he, “I know too well what it is
now; I know, by sad experience. But, Christie,
money will cure it in your case, and it shall, too;
only instead of five pounds, we must put a thou-
sand pounds or two to your banker's account,
and then they will all see your beauty, and run
after you.”
“How daur ye even to me that I'm seekin' a
lad?” cried she, rising from her stool; “I would
na care, suppose there was na a lad in Britain.”
And off she flounced.
“Offended her by my gross want of tact,”
thought the Viscount.
She crept back, and two velvet lips touched
his hand. That was because she had spoken
harshly to a friend.
"Oh! Richard,” said she, despairingly, “I'll no
be lang in this warld.”
He was touched: and it was then he took

her head and kissed her brow, and said, “This
will never do; my child, go home and have a
nice cry, and I will speak to Jean; and rely upon
me, I will not leave the neighbourhood till I have
arranged it all to your satisfaction.”
And so she went,-a little, a very, very little
-comforted by his tone and words.
Now this was all very pretty; but then seen at
a distance of fifty yards, it looked very ugly; and
Gatty, who had never before known jealousy, the
strongest and worst of human passions, was ripe
for anything.
He met Lord Ipsden, and said at once, in his
wise, temperate way:
“Sir, you are a villain!"
Ipsden. “Plait-il ?”
Gatty. “You are a villain!"
Ipsden. “How do you make that out?"
Gatty. “But, of course, you are not a coward,
too."
Ipsden (ironically). “You surprise me with
your moderation, Sir.”
Gatty. “Then you will waive your rank,-

you are a Lord, I believe,-and give me satis-
faction."
Ipsden. “My rank, Sir, such as it is, engages
me to give a proper answer to proposals of this
sort; I am at your orders.”
Gatty. “A man of your character must often
have been called to an account by your victims,
so—10—"-(hesitating)——“perhaps you will tell
me the proper course.”
Ipsden. “I shall send a note to the castle,
and the Colonel will send me down somebody
with a moustache; I shall pretend to remember
moustache, moustache will pretend he remembers
me; he will then communicate with your friend,
and they will arrange it all for us."
Gatty. “And, perhaps, through your licen-
tiousness, one or both of us will be killed.”
Ipsden. “Yes! but we need not trouble our
heads about that,—the seconds undertake every-
thing."
Gatty. “I have no pistols.”
Ipsden. “If you will do me the honour to
use one of mine, it shall be at your service.”

Gatty. “Thank you."
Ipsden. “To-morrow morning?"
Gatty. “No. I have four days' painting to
do on my picture, I can't die till it is finished;-
Friday morning."
Ipsden. “(He is mad.) I wish to ask you a
question, you will excuse my curiosity. Have
you any idea what we are agreeing to differ
about?”
Gatty. “The question does you little credit,
my Lord; that is to add insult to wrong."
He went off hurriedly, leaving Lord Ipsden
mystified.
He thought Christie Johnstone was somehow
connected with it; but conscious of no wrong, he
felt little disposed to put up with any insult,
especially from this boy, to whom he had been
kind, he thought.
His Lordship was, besides, one of those good,
simple-minded creatures, educated abroad, who,
when invited to fight, simply bow, and load two
pistols, and get themselves called at six; instead
of taking down tomes of casuistry and puzzling

their poor brains to find out whether they are
game-cocks or capons, and why.
As for Gatty, he hurried home in a fever of
passion, begged his mother's pardon, and re-
proached himself for ever having disobeyed her
on account of such a perfidious creature as
Christie Johnstone.
He then told her what he had seen, as dis-
tance and imagination had presented it to him;
to his surprise the old lady cut him short.
“Charles,” said she, “there is no need to take
the girl's character away; she has but one fault,
she is not in the same class of life as you, and
such marriages always lead to misery; but in
other respects she is a worthy young woman,—
don't speak against her character, or you will
make my flesh creep; you don't know what her
character is to a woman, high or low.”
By this moderation perhaps she held him still
faster.
Friday morning arrived. Gatty had, by hard
work, finished his picture, collected his sketches
from nature, which were numerous, left by me-

morandum everything to his mother, and was, or
rather felt, as ready to die as live.
He had hardly spoken a word, or eaten a
meal, these four days; his mother was in anxiety
about him. He rose early, and went down to
Leith; an hour later, his mother, finding him
gone out, rose, and went to seek him at New-
haven.
Meantime Flucker had entirely recovered, but
his sister's colour had left her cheeks; and the
boy swore vengeance against the cause of her
distress.
On Friday morning, then, there paced on
Leith Sands two figures.
One was Lord Ipsden.
The other seemed a military gentleman, who
having swallowed the mess-room poker, and
found it insufficient, had added the ramrods of
his company
The more his Lordship reflected on Gatty,
the less inclined he had felt to invite a satirical
young dog from barracks to criticise such a
rencontre; he had therefore ordered Saunders to

get up as a Field-Marshal, or some such trifle,
and what Saunders would have called incom-
parable verticality was the result.
The Painter was also in sight.
Whilst he was coming up, Lord Ipsden was
lecturing Marshal Saunders on a point on which
that worthy had always thought himself very
superior to his master—"Gentlemanly deportment.”
“Now, Saunders, mind and behave like a
gentleman, or we shall be found out.”
“I trust, my Lord, my conduct—"
“What I mean is, you must not be so over-
poweringly gentleman-like, as you are apt to be;
no gentleman is so gentleman-like as all that; it
could not be borne, c'est suffoquant; and a white
handkerchief is unsoldier-like-and nobody ties a
white handkerchief so well as that; of all the
vices, perfection is the most intolerable.". His
Lordship then touched with his cane the
Generalissimo's tie, whose countenance straight-
way fell, as though he had lost three successive
battles.
Gatty came up.

They saluted.
“Where is your second, Sir?” said the
Maréchal.
“My second?” said Gatty. “Ah! I forgot to
wake him— does it matter?”
"It is merely a custom,” said Lord Ipsden,
with a very slightly satirical manner. “Sava-
nadero," said he, “do us the honour to measure
the ground, and be everybody's second.”
Savanadero measured the ground, and handed
a pistol to each combatant, and struck an im-
posing attitude apart.
“Are you ready, gentlemen?" said this Jack-
o'-both-sides.
“Yes!” said both.
Just as the signal was about to be given, an
interruption occurred.—“I beg your pardon,
Sir,” said Lord Ipsden to his antagonist; “I am
going to take a liberty—a great liberty with you,
but I think you will find your pistol is only at
half-cock.”
“Thank you, my Lord; what am I to do with
the thing?"
Christie Johnstone.

“Draw back the cock so, and be ready to fire.”
"So?” Bang!
He had touched the trigger as well as the
cock, so off went the barker; and after a con-
siderable pause the Field-Marshal sprang yelling
into the air.
“Hallo!” cried Mr. Gatty.
“Ah! oh! I'm a dead man," whined the
General.
“Nonsense!” said Ipsden, after a moment
of anxiety. “Give yourself no concern, Sir,"
said he, soothingly, to his antagonist—"A mere
accident.—Maréchal, reload Mr. Gatty's pistol.”
“Excuse me, my Lord—”.
“Load his pistol directly,” said his Lordship,
sternly; "and behave like a gentleman.”
“My Lord! my Lord! but where shall I stand
to be safe?"
“Behind me!"
The Commander of Division advanced re-
luctantly for Gatty's pistol.
“No, my Lord!” said Gatty, “it is plain I
am not a fit antagonist; I shall but expose

myself—and my mother has separated us; I
have lost her—if you do not win her, some
worse man may; but oh! if you are a man use
her tenderly."
“Whom?"
“Christie Johnstone! Oh, Sir, do not make
her regret me too much! She was my treasure,
iny consolation,-she was to be my wife, she
would have cheered the road of life—it is a
desert now. I loved her_1_1_"
Here the poor fellow choked.
Lord Ipsden turned round, and threw his
pistol to Saunders, saying, “Catch that, Saun-
ders.”
Saunders, on the contrary, by a single
motion changed his person from a vertical
straight line to a horizontal line, exactly parallel
with the earth's surface, and the weapon sang in-
noxious over him.
His Lordship then, with a noble defiance of
etiquette, walked up to his antagonist and gave
him his hand, with a motion no one could re-
sist;—for he felt for the poor fellow.

“It is all a mistake,” said he. “There is no
sentiment between La Johnstone and me but
mutual esteem. I will explain the whole thing;
I admire her for her virtue, her wit, her in-
nocence, her goodness, and all that sort of thing;
and she—what she sees in me, I am sure I don't
know," added he, slightly shrugging his aristo-
cratic shoulders. “Do me the honour to break-
fast with me at Newhaven.”
“I have ordered twelve sorts of fish at the
Peacock, my Lord,” said Saunders.
“Divine! (I hate fish) I told Saunders all
would be hungry and none shot; by-the-by, you
are winged, I think you said, Saunders?"
“No, my Lord! but look at my trousers.”
The bullet had cut his pantaloons.
"I see—only barked; so go and see about
our breakfast.”
“Yes, my Lord” (faintly).
“And draw on me for fifty pounds worth of
-new trousers."
“Yes, my Lord” (sonorously).
The duellists separated, Gatty taking the

short cut to Newhaven; he proposed to take his
favourite swim there, to refresh himself before
breakfast; and he went from his Lordship a little
cheered by remarks which fell from him, and
which, though vague, sounded friendly;—poor
fellow, except when he had brush in hand he
was a dreamer.
This Viscount, who did not seem to trouble
his head about class dignity, was to convert
his mother from her aristocratic tendencies, or
something
Que sais-je? what will not a dreamer hope?
Lord Ipsden strolled along the sands, and
judge his surprise, when, attended by two foot-
· men, he met at that time in the morning, Lady
Barbara Sinclair.
Lord Ipsden had been so disheartened and
piqued by this lady's conduct, that for a whole
week he had not been near her: this line of be-
haviour sometimes answers.
She met him with a grand display of cor-
diality.
She inquired, “Whether he had heard of a

most gallant action, that, coupled with another
circumstance (here she smiled) had in part, re-
conciled her to the age we live in?”
He asked for further particulars.
She then informed him “that a ship had been
ashore on the rocks, that no fishermen dared
venture out, that a young gentleman had given
them his whole fortune, and so bribed them to
accompany him; that he had saved the ship and
the men's lives, paid away his fortune, and
lighted an odious cigar, and gone home, never
minding, amidst the blessings and acclamations
of a maritime population.”
A beautiful story she told him; so beautiful,
in fact, that until she had discoursed ten
minutes, he hardly recognized his own feat; but
when he did, he blushed inside as well as
out with pleasure. Oh! music of music-praise
from eloquent lips, and those lips, the lips we
love.
The next moment he felt ashamed; ashamed
that Lady Barbara should praise him beyond his
merits, as he conceived.

He made a faint hypocritical endeavour to
moderate her eulogium; this gave matters an
unexpected turn, Lady Barbara's eyes flashed
defiance.
“I say it was a noble action, that one nursed
in effeminacy (as you all are), should teach the
hardy seamen to mock at peril-noble fellow!"
“He did a man's duty, Barbara.”
"Ipsden, take care, you will make me hate
you, if you detract from a deed you cannot
emulate. This gentleman risked his own life to
save others—he is a hero! I should know him
by his face the moment I saw him. Oh that I
were such a man, or knew where to find such a
creature!"
The water came into Lord Ipsden's eyes; he
did not know what to say or do; he turned away
his head.
Lady Barbara was surprised; her conscience
smote her.
“Oh, dear," said she, “there now, I have
given you pain-forgive me; we can't all be
heroes; dear Ipsden, don't think I despise you

now as I used. Oh, no! I have heard of your
goodness to the poor, and I have more expe-
rience now. There is nobody I esteem more
than you, Richard, so you need not look so.”
“Thank you, dearest Barbara.”
“Yes, and if you were to be such a goose as
to write me another letter proposing absurdities
to me-_" ,
“Would the answer be different?”
“Very different."
“Oh, Barbara! would you accept?”.
“Why, of course not-but I would refuse
civilly!”
“Ah!”
“There, don't sigh; I hate a sighing man.
I'll tell you something that I know will make you
laugh.” She then smiled saucily in his face, and
said, “Do you remember Mr.-_"
L'effrontée! this was the earnest man.
But Ipsden was a match for her this time.
"I think I do,” said he; "a gentleman who
wants to make John Bull little again into John
Calf; but it won't do."

Her Ladyship laughed. “Why did you not
tell us that on Inch Coombe?”
“Because I had not read "The Catspaw'
then.”
““The Catspaw?! Ah! I thought it could not
be you. Whose is it?"
“Mr. Jerrold's.”
“Then Mr. Jerrold is cleverer than you."
“It is possible.”
“It is certain! Well, Mr. Jerrold and Lord
Ipsden, you will both be glad to hear that it
was, in point of fact, a bull that confuted the
advocate of the Middle Ages; we were walking;
he was telling me manhood was extinct except
in a few earnest men who lived upon the past,
its associations, its truth; when a horrid bull
gave-oh-such a bellow! and came trotting up.
I screamed and ran–I remember nothing but
arriving at the stile, and lo, on the other side,
offering me his arm with empressement across the
wooden barrier was-2”

“Well! don't you see?”

“No-oh-yes, I see!— fancy-ah! Shall I
tell you how he came to get first over? He ran
more earnestly than you."
“It is not Mr. Jerrold this time, I presume,”
said her satirical Ladyship.
“No! you cannot always have him. I venture
to predict your Ladyship on your return home
gave this mediæval personage his congé."
“No!”
“No?"
“I gave it him at the stile! Let us be serious,
if you please; I have a confidence to make you,
Ipsden. Frankly, I owe you some apology for
my conduct of late; I meant to be reserved—I
have been rude,—but you shall judge me. A
year ago you made me some proposals; I rejected
them because, though I like you --"
“You like me?"
"I detest your character. Since then, my
West India estate has been turned into specie;
that specie, the bulk of my fortune, placed on
board a vessel; that vessel lost, at least we think
so--she has not been heard of.”

“My dear cousin."
“Do you comprehend that now I am cooler
than ever to all young gentlemen who have large
incomes, and” (holding out her hand like an
angel,) “I must trouble you to forgive me.”
He kissed her lovely hand.
“I esteem you more and more," said he.
“You ought, for it has been a hard struggle
to me not to adore you, because you are so im-
proved, mon cousin."
“Is it possible? In what respect?"
“You are browner and charitabler; and I
should have been very kind to you—mawkishly
kind I fear, my sweet cousin, if this wretched
money had not gone down in the ‘Tisbe.'”
“Hallo!” cried the Viscount.
“Ah!” squeaked Lady Barbara, unused to
such interjections.
“Gone down in what?" said Ipsden in a loud
voice.
“Don't bellow in people's ears. The 'Tisbe,'
stupid,” cried she, screaming at the top of her
voice.

how it was done before. It is very, very

Lady Barb. “Si, je polke, Monsieur le Vi-

They polked for a second or two.

Barbara, “but I like you better now you are a

an insipid non-intellectual—you are greatly im-
proved.”

Lady Barb. “Did I not tell you? browner
and more impudent; but tell me," said she,
resuming her sly satirical tone, “how is it that

dance and sing over the wreck of my for-
tunes?"
“Because they are not wrecked."

down."
Lady Barb. “I tell you it is."
Ipsden. “I assure you it is not."
Lady Barb. “It is not?"
Ipsden. “Barbara! I am too happy, I begin
to nourish such sweet hopes once more; oh, I
could fall on my knees and bless you for some-
thing you said just now.”
Lady Barbara blushed to the temples.
“Then why don't you?" said she. “All you
want is a little enthusiasm." Then recovering
herself, she said-
“You kneel on wet sand, with black trousers
on; that will never be !!!"
These two were so occupied that they did
not observe the approach of a stranger until he
broke in upon their dialogue.
An Ancient Mariner had been for some
minutes standing off and on, reconnoitring Lord
Ipsden; he now bore down, and with great rough,

roaring cordiality, that made Lady Barbara start,
cried out-
“Give me your hand, Sir,—give me your
hand, if you were twice a lord.
“I couldn't speak to you till the brig was
safe in port, and you slipped away, but I've
brought you up at last; and give me your hand
again, Sir. I say, isn't it a pity you are a lord
instead of a sailor?"
Ipsden. “But I am a sailor."
Ancient Mariner. “That ye are, and as smart
a one as ever tied a true-lover's knot in the top;
but tell the truth,.-you were never nearer losing
the number of your mess than that day in the
old Tisbe.'”
Lady Barb. “The old ‘Tisbe'! Oh!"
Ipsden. “Do you remember that nice little
lurch she gave to leeward as we brought her round?”
Lady Barb. “Oh, Richard!”
Ancient Mariner. “And that reel the old
wench gave under our feet, north the pier-head.
I wouldn't have given a washing-tub for her at
that moment.”

Ipsden. “Past danger becomes pleasure, Sir.
Olim et hæc meminisse—I beg your pardon, Sir.”
Ancient Mariner (taking off his hat, with
feeling). “God bless ye, Sir, and send ye many
happy days, and well spent, with the pretty
lady I see alongside; asking your pardon, Miss,
for parting pleasanter company, so I'll sheer
off.”
And away went the skipper of the 'Tisbe,'
rolling fearfully. In the heat of this reminis-
cence, the skipper of the yacht (they are all
alike, blue water once fairly tasted) had lost
sight of Lady Barbara; he now looked round.
Imagine his surprise!
Her Ladyship was in tears.
“Dear Barbara,” said Lord Ipsden, “do not
distress yourself on my account.”
"It is not your fe-feelings I care about; at
least, I h-h-hope not; but I have been so unjust,
and I prided myself so on my j-ju-justice.”
“Never mind!”
“Oh! if you don't, I don't. I hate myself, so
it is no wonder you h-hate me.”

“Then you are a good soul! Of course you
know I always l-esteemed you, Richard.”
“No! I had an idea you despised me!”
“How silly you are! Can't you see? When
I thought you were not perfection, which you
are now, it vexed me to death; you never saw
me affront any one but you?”
“No, I never did! What does that prove?"
“That depends upon the wit of him that
reasons thereon.” (Coming to herself.)
“I love you, Barbara! Will you honour me
with your hand?"
“No! I am not so base, so selfish: you are
worth a hundred of me, and here have I been
treating you de haut en bas. Dear Richard,
poor Richard. Oh! oh! oh!” (A perfect flood
of tears.)
“Barbara! I regret nothing: this moment pays
for all.”
“Well then, I will! since you keep pressing
me. There, let me go; I must be alone; I must
tell the sea how unjust I was, and how happy I

am, and when you see me again, you shall see
the better side of your cousin Barbara.”
She was peremptory. “She had her folly
and his merits to think over,” she said; but she
promised to pass through Newhaven, and he
should put her into her pony-phaeton, which
would meet her there.
Lady Barbara was only a fool by the excess
of her wit over her experience; and Lord
Ipsden's love was not misplaced, for she had
a great heart, which she hid from little people.
I forgive her!
The resolutions she formed in company with
the sea, having dismissed Ipsden, and ordered
her flunky into the horizon, will probably give
our Viscount just half a century of conjugal
bliss.
As he was going, she stopped him and said,
“Your friend had browner hands than I have
hitherto conceived possible. To tell the truth,
I took them for the claws of a mahogany table
when he grappled you,—is that the term? C'est
égal—I like him ”
Christie Johnstone.

She stopped him again. "Ipsden, in the midst
of all this that poor man's ship is broken. I feel
it is! You will buy him another, if you really
love me, for I like him.”
And so these lovers parted for a time; and
Lord Ipsden with a bounding heart returned to
Newhaven. He went to entertain his late vis-d-
vis at the “Peacock.”
Meantime a shorter and less pleasant ren-
contre had taken place between Leith and that
village.
Gatty felt he should meet his lost sweet-
heart; and sure enough, at a turn of the road
Christie and Jean came suddenly upon him.
Jean nodded, but Christie took no notice of
him; they passed him; he turned and followed
them, and said, “Christie
“What is your will wi' me?" said she, coldly.
“I-I-how pale you are.”
“I am no very weel.”

Christie thanked her with a look.

“I hope it is not-not—"
“Nae fears, lad,” said she, briskly; “I dinna
think that muckle o' ye.”
“And I think of nothing but you,” said he.
A deep flush crimsoned the young woman's
brow, but she restrained herself, and said icily,
“Thaat's very gude o' ye, I'm sure.”
Gatty felt all the contempt her manners and
words expressed. He bit his lips: the tear started
to his eye. “You will forget me,” said he: “I do
not deserve to be remembered, but I shall never
forget you. I leave for England: I leave New-
haven for ever, where I have been so happy. I
am going at three o'clock by the steam-boat:
won't you bid me good-by?” he approached her
timidly.
“Ay! that wull do,” cried she; “Gude be wi’
ye, lad; I wish ye nae ill.” She gave a com-
manding gesture of dismissal; he turned away,
and went sadly from her.
She watched every motion when his back was
turned.

“That is you, Christie,” said Jean; “use the

“Oh, Jean, my hairt's broken. I'm just deeing

“Let me speak till him then,” said Jean; “I'll
sune bring him till his marrow-banes;” and she
took a hasty step to follow him.
Christie held her fast. “I'd dee ere I'd give
in till them. Oh, Jean! I'm a lassy clean flung
awa; he has neither hairt nor spunk ava, yon
lad!”
Jean began to make excuses for him: Christie
inveighed against him: Jean spoke up for him
with more earnestness.
Now observe, Jean despised the poor boy.
Christie adored him.
So Jean spoke for him, because women of
every degree are often one solid mass of tact;
and Christie abused him, because she wanted to
hear him defended.

CHAPTER XVI.
an-
RICHARD, Lord Viscount Ipsden, having dotted
the sea-shore with sentinels, to tell him of Lady
Barbara's approach, awaited his guest in the
“Peacock”; but as Gatty was a little behind time,
he placed Saunders sentinel over the “Peacock,"
and strolled eastward; as he came out of the
“Peacock," Mrs. Gatty came down the little hill
in front, and also proceeded eastward; mean
time Lady Barbara and her escort were not far
from the New Town of Newhaven, on their way
from Leith.
Mrs. Gatty came down, merely with a vague
fear. She had no reason to suppose her son's
alliance with Christie either would or could be
renewed, but she was a careful player and would
not give a chance away; she found he was gone
out unusually early, so she came straight to the
only place she dreaded; it was her son's last day

in Scotland. She had packed his clothes, and he
had inspired her with confidence by arranging
pictures, &c., himself; she had no idea he was
packing for his departure from this life, not Edin-
burgh only.
She came then to Newhaven with no serious
misgivings, for even if her son had again vacil-
lated, she saw that with Christie's pride and her
own firmness, the game must be hers in the end;
but as I said before, she was one who played her
cards closely, and such seldom lose.
But my story is with the two young fish-
wives, who, on their return from Leith, found
themselves at the foot of the New Town, New-
haven, some minutes before any of the other
persons who, it is to be observed, were approach-
ing it from different points: they came slowly in,
Christie in particular, with a listlessness she had
never known till this last week; for some days
her strength had failed her--it was Jean that
carried the creel now-before, Christie, in the
pride of her strength, would always do more than
her share of their joint labour: then she could

hardly be forced to eat, and what she did eat
was quite tasteless to her, and sleep left her, and
in its stead came uneasy slumbers, from which
she awoke quivering from head to foot.
Oh! perilous venture of those who love one
object with the whole heart.
This great but tender heart was breaking day
by day.
Well, Christie and Jean strolling slowly into
the New Town of Newhaven, found an assem-
blage of the natives all looking seaward; the
fishermen, except Sandy Liston, were away at the
herring fishery, but all the boys and women of
the New Town were collected; the girls felt a
momentary curiosity; it proved, however, to be
only an individual swimming in towards shore
from a greater distance than usual.
A little matter excites curiosity in such places.
The man's head looked like a spot of ink.
Sandy Liston was minding his own business
lazily mending a skait net, which he had at-
tached to a crazy old herring-boat hauled up
to rot.

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Christie sat down, pale and languid, by him,
on a creepie that a lass who had been baiting
a line with mussels had just vacated; suddenly
she seized Jean's arm with a convulsive motion;
Jean looked up-it was the London steamboat
running out from Leith to Granton Pier to take
up her passengers for London. Charles Gatty
was going by that boat; the look of mute despair
the poor girl gave, went to Jean's heart—she ran
hastily from the group, and cried out of sight
for poor Christie.
A fishwife looking through a telescope at the
swimmer, remarked, "He's coming in fast; he's a
gallant swimmer yon—"
“Can he dee't?” inquired Christie, of Sandy
Liston.
“Fine thaat,” was the reply, "he does it aye
o' Sundays when ye are at the kirk.”
“It's no oot o' the kirk window ye'll hae seen
him, Sandy, my mon,” said a young fishwife.
“Rin for my glass ony way, Flucker," said
Christie, forcing herself to take some little in-
terest.

Flucker brought it to her, she put her hand
on his shoulder, got slowly up, and stood on
the creepie, and adjusted the focus of her glass;
after a short view, she said to Flucker-
“Rin and see the nock.” She then levelled
her glass again at the swimmer.
Flucker informed her the nock said “half
eleven”-Scotch for “half-past ten.”
Christie whipped out a well-thumbed alma-
nack.
Yon nock's aye ahint,” said she. She swept
the sea once more with her glass, then brought it
together with a click, and jumped off the stool:
her quick intelligence viewed the matter dif-
ferently from all the others.
“Noow, cried she, smartly, “wha'll lend me
his yawl?”
“Hets, dinna be sae interferin, lassie,” said a
fishwife.
“Hae nane o' ye ony spunk?” said Christie,
taking no notice of the woman. “Speak, lad-
dies!”

“M’uncle's yawl is at the pier-head; ye'll get
her, my woman,” said a boy.
“A schellin for wha's first on board,” said
Christie, holding up the coin.
“Come awa, Flucker, we'll hae her schell'n,”
and these two worthies instantly effected a false
start.
“It's no under your jackets," said Christie, as
she dashed after them like the wind.
“Haw! haw! haw!” laughed Sandy.
"What's her business picking up a mon
against his will?” said a woman.
“She's an awfu' lassie," whined another.
The examination of the swimmer was then
continued, and the crowd increased; some would
have it he was rapidly approaching, others that
he made little or no way.
“Wha est?” said another.
“It's a lummy,” said a girl.
“Na! it's no a lummy,” said another.
Christie's boat was now seen standing out
from the pier. Sandy Liston, casting a con-
temptuous look on all the rest, lifted himself

lazily into the herring-boat and looked seaward.
His manner changed in a moment.
“The deevil!” cried he; "the tide's turned !
You wi’ your glass, could you no see yon man's
drifting oot to sea?”
“Hech!” cried the women, “he'll be drooned
--he'll be drooned!"
“Yes; he'll be drooned!” cried Sandy, "if
yon lassie does na come alongside him deevelich
quick-he's sair spent I dont.”
Two spectators were now added to the scene,
Mrs. Gatty and Lord Ipsden. Mrs. Gatty in-
quired what was the matter.
“ It's a mon drooning,” was the reply.
The poor fellow, whom Sandy, by aid of his
glass, now discovered to be in a worn-out con-
dition, was about half a mile east of Newhaven
pier-head, and unfortunately the wind was nearly
due east. Christie was standing north-north-east,
her boat-hook jammed against the sail, which
stood as flat as a knife.
The natives of the Old Town were now seen

pouring down to the pier and the beach, and
strangers were collecting like bees.
“After wit is everybody's wit!!!” — Old
Proverb.
The affair was in the Johnstone's hands.
“That boat is not going to the poor man,”
said Mrs. Gatty, “it is turning its back upon
him.”
“She canna lie in the wind's eye, for as clever
as she is,” answered a fishwife.
“I ken wha it is,” suddenly squeaked a little
fishwife; "it's Christie Johnstone's lad, it's yon
daft painter fr England. Hech!” cried she,
suddenly, observing Mrs. Gatty, “it's your son,
woman.”
The unfortunate woman gave a fearful scream,
and flying like a tiger on Liston, commanded
him “to go straight out to sea, and save her son.”
Jean Carnie seized her arm, “Div ye see yon
boat?” cried she, “and div ye mind Christie, the
lass wha's hairt ye hae broken? a weel, woman,
—it's just a race between deeth and Cirsty John-
stone for your son.”

The poor old woman swooned dead away;
they carried her into Christie Johnstone's house,
and laid her down, then hurried back,—the
greater terror absorbed the less.
Lady Barbara Sinclair was there from Leith,
and seeing Lord Ipsden standing in the boat with
a fisherman, she asked him to tell her what it
was; neither he nor any one answered her.
“Why doesn't she come about, Liston?” cried
Lord Ipsden, stamping with anxiety and im-
patience.
“She'll no be lang,” said Sandy; "but they'll
mak a mess o’t wi' ne'er a man i' the boat."
“Ye're sure o' thaat?” put in a woman.
“Ay, about she comes,” said Liston, as the
sail came down on the first tack. He was mis-
taken; they dipped the lug as cleverly as any
man in the town could.
“Hech! look at her hauling on the rope like
a mon,” cried a woman. The sail flew up on the
other tack.
“She's an awfu' lassie,” whined another.
“He's awa,” groaned Liston, “he's doon!"


## p. 286 (#290) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
“No! he's up again,” cried Lord Ipsden; “but
I fear he can't live till the boat comes to him.”
The fisherman and the viscount held on by
each other.
“He does na see her, or maybe he'd tak
hairt.”
“I'd give ten thousand pounds if only he
could see her. My God, the man will be drowned
under our eyes.—If he but saw her!!!”
The words had hardly left Lord Ipsden's lips,
when the sound of a woman's voice came like an
Æolian note across the water.
“Hurraih!” roared Liston, and every creature
joined the cheer.
"She'll no let him dee. Ay! she's in the
bows, hailing him an' waving the lad's bonnet
ower her head to gie him coorage. Gude bless
ye, lass; Gude bless ye!"
Christie knew it was no use hailing him
against the wind, but the moment she got the
wind she darted into the bows, and pitched in
its highest key her full and brilliant voice; after
a moment of suspense she received proof that she

must be heard by him, for on the pier now hung
men and women, clustered like bees, breathless
with anxiety, and the moment after she hailed
the drowning man, she saw and heard a wild yell
of applause burst from the pier, and the pier was
more distant than the man. She snatched Flucker's
cap, planted her foot on the gunwale, held on by
a rope, hailed the poor fellow again, and waved
the cap round and round her head, to give him
courage; and in a moment, at the sight of this,
thousands of voices thundered back their cheers
to her across the water. Blow, wind,--spring,
boat,—and you, Christie, still ring life towards
those despairing ears, and wave hope to those
sinking eyes; cheer the boat on, you thousands
that look upon this action: Hurrah! from the pier:
Hurrah! from the town: Hurrah! from the shore:
Hurrah! now, from the very ships in the roads;
whose crews are swarming on the yards to look;
five minutes ago they laughed at you; three thou-
sand eyes and hearts hang upon you now, ay,
these are the moments we live for!
And now dead silence. The boat is within

fifty-yards, they are all three consulting together
round the mast: an error now is death; his fore-
head only seems above water.
“If they miss him on that tack?” said Lord
Ipsden, significantly, to Liston.
“He'll never see London Brigg again,” was
the whispered reply.
They carried on till all on shore thought they
would run over him, or past him; but no, at ten
yards distant they were all at the sail, and had it
down like lightning; and then Flucker sprang to
the bows, the other boy to the helm.
Unfortunately, there were but two Johnstones
in the boat; and this boy, in his hurry, actually
put the helm to port, instead of to starboard.
Christie, who stood amid-ships, saw the error; she
sprang aft, Aung the boy from the helm, and
jammed it hard-a-starboard with her foot. The
boat answered the helm, but too late for Flucker;
the man was four yards from him as the boat
drifted by
“He's a deed mon!” cried Liston, on shore.
The boat's length gave one more little chance;

the after-part must drift nearer him—thanks to
Christie. Flucker flew aft; flung himself on his
back, and seized his sister's petticoats.
“Fling yourself ower the gunwale,” screamed
he. “Ye'll no hurt; I'se haud ye.”
. She flung herself boldly over the gunwale; the
man was sinking, her nails touched his hair, her
fingers entangled themselves in it, she gave him a
powerful wrench and brought him alongside; the
boys pinned him like wild cats.
: Christie darted away forward to the mast,
passed a rope round it, threw it the boys, in a
moment it was under his shoulders, Christie
hauled on it from the fore thwart, the boys lifted
him, and they tumbled him, gasping and gurgling
like a dying salmon, into the bottom of the boat,
and flung net, and jackets, and sail over him, to
keep the life in him.
Ah! draw your breath all hands at sea and
ashore, and don't try it again, young gentleman,
for there was nothing to spare: when you were
missed at the bow two stout hearts quivered for
you; Lord Ipsden hid his face in his two hands,
Christie Johnstone.

Sandy Liston gave a groan, and when you were
grabbed astern, jumped out of his boat, and
cried-
"A jill o' whiskey for ony favour, for it's
turned me as seeck as a doeg.” He added, “He
may bless yon lassie's fowr banes, for she's taen
him oot o' deeth's maw, as sure as Gude's in
heaven!”
Lady Barbara who had all her life been long-
ing to see perilous adventures, prayed, and trem-
bled, and cried most piteously; and Lord Ipsden's
back was to her, and he paid no attention to her
voice; but when the battle was won and Lord
Ipsden turned and saw her, she clung to his arm
and dried her tears; and then the Old Town
cheered the boat, and the New Town cheered
the boat, and the towns cheered each other;
and the Johnstones, lad and lass, set their sail,
and swept back in triumph to the pier; so
then Lady Barbara's blood mounted and tingled
in her veins like fire. “Oh, how noble!” cried
she.
“Yes, dearest," said Ipsden. “You have seen

something great done at last; and by a woman,
too!”
“Yes," said Barbara, "how beautiful! oh! how
beautiful it all is; only the next one I see I
should like the danger to be over first, that is all.”
The boys and Christie, the moment they had
saved Gatty, up sail again for Newhaven; they
landed in about three minutes at the pier.

They came in to the pier, Christie sitting
quietly on the thwart after her work, the boy
steering, and Flucker standing against the mast,
hands in his pockets; the deportment this young
gentleman thought fit to assume on this occasion
was complete apathy;' he came into port with
the air of one bringing home the ordinary results
of his day's fishing; this was, I suppose, to im-
press the spectators with the notion that saving
lives was an everyday affair with La Famille

Johnstone; as for Gatty, he came to himself under
his heap of nets and jackets, and spoke once be-
tween Death's jaw and the pier.
“Beautiful!” murmured he, and was silent.
The meaning of this observation never transpired,
and never will in this world. Six months after-
wards, being subjected to a searching interroga-
tory, he stated that he had alluded to the majesty
and freedom of a certain pose Christie had
adopted whilst hailing him from the boat; but
reader, if he had wanted you and me to believe
it was this, he should not have been half a year
finding it out—increduli odimus! They landed,
and Christie sprang on shore; whilst she was
wending her way through the crowd, impeded
by greetings and acclamations, with every now
and then a lass waving her kerchief or a lad his
bonnet over the heroine's head, poor Mrs. Gatty
was receiving the attention of the New Town;
they brought her to, they told her the good news
-she thanked God.
The whole story had spread like wildfire; they
expostulated with her, they told her, now was the

time to show she had a heart, and bless the
young people. .
She rewarded them with a valuable precept.
“Mind your own business!” said she.
“Hech! y' are a dour wife!" cried Newhaven.
The dour wife bent her eyes on the ground.
The people were still collected at the foot of
the street, but they were now in knots, when in
dashed Flucker, arriving by a short cut, and cry-
ing, “She does na ken, she does na ken, she was
ower moedest to look, I daur say, and ye'll no
tell her, for he's a blackguard, an' he's just mak-
ing a fule oʻthe puir lass, and if she kens what
she has done for him, she'll be fonder o' him
than a coow o' her cauf.”
“Oh, Flucker! we maun tell her, its her lad,
her ain lad, she saved,” expostulated a woman.
“Did ever my feyther do a good turn till ye?”
cried Flucker. “Aweel then, ye'll no tell the
lassy, she's weel as she is; he's gaun † Enngland

with an eye that flashed volumes of good inten.

tion, on a hundred and fifty people; “but I am
feytherless and motherless, an' I can fa' on my
knees an' curse ye a' if ye do us sic an ill turn,
an' then ye'll see whether ye'll thrive.”
“We'll no tell, Flucker, ye need na currse us
ony way."
His Lordship, with all the sharp authority of
a skipper, ordered Master Flucker to the pier, with
a message to the yacht; Flucker quâ yachtsman
was a machine, and went as a matter of course.
“I am determined to tell her," said Lord Ipsden
to Lady Barbara.
“But,” remonstrated Lady Barbara, “the poor
boy says he will curse us if we do."
“He won't curse me."
“How do you know that?”
“Because the little blackguard's grog would
be stopped on board the yacht if he did.”
Flucker had not been gone many minutes be-
fore loud cheering was heard, and Christie John-
stone appeared convoyed by a large detachment
of the Old Town; she had tried to slip away but

they would not let her. They convoyed her in
triumph till they saw the New Town people, and
then they turned and left her.
She came in amongst the groups, a changed
woman-her pallor and her listlessness were gone
-the old light was in her eye, and the bright
colair in her cheek, and she seemed hardly to
toucı the earth. “I'm just droukit, lasses,” cried
she, gaily, wringing her sleeve. Every eye was
upon her; did she know, or did she not know,
what he had done?
Lod Ipsden stepped forward; the people tacitly
accepte him as the vehicle of their curiosity.
“Who was it, Christie?"
“I dnna ken, for my pairt!"
Mrs. Jatty came out of the house.
"A hadsome young fellow, I hope, Christie?”
resumed lord Ipsden.
“Ye mun ask Flucker," was the reply. “I
could no tk muckle notice, ye ken,” putting her
hand before her eye, and half smiling.

“Well! I hear he is very good looking; and I
hear you think so, too."
She glided to him, and looked in his faci.
He gave a meaning smile. The poor girl looked
quite perplexed. Suddenly she gave a violnt
start.
“Christie! where is Christie?” had crid a
well-known voice. He had learned on the pier
who had saved him—he had slipped up anong
the boats to find her-he could not find hs hat
-he could not wait for it-his dripping hair
showed where he had been it was he love,
whom she had just saved out of death's vey jaws.
She gave a cry of love, that went through
every heart, high or low, young or old, tht heard
it. And she went to him, through tie air it
seemed; but quick as she was, anothe was as
quick; the mother had seen him first, anl she was
there. Christie saw nothing. With apther cry,
the very key-note of her great and lợing heart,
she flung her arms round--Mrs. fatty, who
was on the same errand as herself.

“Hearts are not steel, and steel is bent;
Hearts are not flint, and flint is rent."
The old woman felt Christie touch her. She
turned from her son in a moment, and wept upon
her neck. Her lover took her hand and kissed
it, and pressed it to his bosom, and tried to speak
to her; but all he could do, was to sob and choke
-and kiss her hand again.
“My daughter!” sobbed the old woman.
At that word Christie clasped her quickly;
and then Christie began to cry.
“I am not a stone,” cried Mrs. Gatty. “I gave
him life; but you have saved him from death.
Oh! Charles; never make her repent what she has
done for you."
She was a woman after all; and prudence and
prejudice melted like snow before her heart.
There were not many dry eyes—least of all
the heroic Lady Barbara's.
The three whom a moment had made one,
were becoming calmer, and taken one another's
hands for life, when a diabolical sound arose-

and what was it, but Sandy Liston, who, after
furious resistance, was blubbering with explosive
but short-lived violence. Having done it, he was
the first to draw everybody's attention to the phe-
nomenon; and affecting to consider it a purely
physical attack, like a coup de soleil, or so on, he
proceeded instantly to Drysel's for his panacea.
Lady Barbara enjoined Lord Ipsden to watch
these people, and not to lose a word they said;
and after she had insisted upon kissing Christie,
she went off to her carriage. And she, too, was
so happy, she cried three distinct times on her
way to Edinburgh.
Lord Ipsden having reminded Gatty of his
engagement, begged him to add his mother and
Christie to the party, and escorted Lady Barbara
to her phaeton.
So then the people dispersed by degrees.
“That old lady's face seems familiar to me,"
said Lord Ipsden, as he stood on the little natural
platform by the “Peacock.” “Do you know who
she is, Saunders ?”

“It is Peggy, that was cook in your Lordship's
uncle's time, my Lord. She married a green-
grocer," added Saunders, with an injured air.
“Hech! hech!” cried Flucker, “Christie has
ta’en up her head wi' a cook's son."
Mrs. Gatty was ushered into the “Peacock,"
with mock civility, by Mr. Saunders. No recogni-
tion took place, each being ashamed of the other
as an acquaintance.
The next arrival was a beautiful young lady,
in a black silk gown, a plain but duck-like plaid
shawl, who proved to be Christie Johnstone, in
her Sunday attire.
When they met, Mrs. Gatty gave a little scream
of joy, and said: “Oh! my child; if I had seen
you in that dress, I should never have said a
word against you.”
“Pars minima est ipsa puella sui!”
His Lordship stepped up to her, took off his
hat, and said: “Will Mrs. Gatty take from me a
commission for two pictures, as big as herself, and

as bonny,” added he, doing a little Scotch. He
handed her a cheque; and turning to Gatty, added,
" at your convenience, Sir, bien entendu.”
“Hech! it's for five hundred pund, Chairles.”
“Good gear gangs in little book,"* said Jean.
“Ay, does it,” replied Flucker, assuming the
compliment.
“My Lord!” said the artist, "you treat art
like a prince; and she shall treat you like a
queen. When the sun comes out again, I will
work for you and fame. You shall have two
things painted, every stroke loyally in the sun-
light. In spite of gloomy winter, and gloomier
London, I will try if I can't hang nature and
summer on your walls for ever. As for me, you
know I must go to Gerard Dow, and Cuyp, and
Pierre de Hoogh, when my little sand is run; but
my handwriting shall warm your children's chil-
dren's hearts, Sir, when this hand is dust.” His
eye turned inwards, he walked to and fro, and
his companions died out of his sight—he was in
the kingdom of art.

His Lordship and Jean entered the “Pea-
cock,” followed by Flucker, who merely lingered
at the door to moralize as follows:
“Hech! hech! isna thaat lamantable? Christie's
mon's as daft as a drunk weaver.”
But one stayed quietly behind, and assumed
that moment the office of her life.
“Ay!” he burst out again, “the resources of
our art are still unfathomed! Pictures are yet to
be painted that shall refresh men's inner souls, and
help their hearts against the artificial world; and
charm the fiend away, like David's harp!! The
world, after centuries of lies, will give nature and
truth a trial. What a paradise art will be, when
truths, instead of lies, shall be told on paper, on
marble, on canvass, and on the boards!!!”
“Dinner's on the boarrd,” murmured Christie,
alluding to Lord Ipsden's breakfast; "and I hae
the charge o' ye,” pulling his sleeve, hard enough
to destroy the equilibrium of a flea.
“Then don't let us waste our time here. Oh,
Christie!"
“What est, my laddy?”

CHAPTER XVII.
“THERE is nothing but meeting and parting
in this world!” and you may be sure the in-
congruous personages of our tale could not long
be together. Their separate paths had met for
an instant, in one focus, furnished then and there
the matter of an eccentric story, and then diverged
for ever.
Our lives have a general current, and also an
episode or two; and the episodes of a common-
place life are often rather startling; in like
manner, this tale is not a specimen, but an
episode of Lord Ipsden and Lady Barbara, who
soon after this married and lived like the rest of
the beau monde. In so doing, they passed out of
my hands; such as wish to know how Viscounts
and Viscountesses feed, and sleep, and do the

Saunders, for instance, who has in the press one
of those cerberus-leviathans of fiction, so common
now; incredible as folio to future ages. Saunders
will take you by the hand, and lead you over
carpets two inches thick-under rosy curtains-
to dinner-tables. He will fête you, and opera
you, and dazzle your young imagination with
epergnes, and salvers, and buhl, and ormolu. No
fishwives or painters shall intrude upon his
polished scenes; all shall be as genteel as him-
self. Saunders is a good authority; he is more
in the society, and far more in the confidence of
the great, than most fashionable novelists. Mr.
Saunders's work will be in three volumes; nine
hundred and ninety pages!!!!!!
In other words, this single work, of this in-
genious writer, will equal in bulk the aggregate
of all the writings extant by Moses, David, Solo-
mon, Isaiah, and St. Paul!!!
I shall not venture into competition with this
behemoth of the salon; I will evaporate in thin
generalities.
Lord Ipsden then lived very happily with

Lady Barbara, whose hero he straightway be-
came, and who nobly and poetically dotes upon
him. He has gone into political life to please
her, and will remain there—to please himself.
They were both very grateful to Newhaven; when
they married, they vowed to visit it twice a year,
and mingle a fortnight's simple life with its
simple scenes; but four years have passed, and
they have never been there again, and I dare say
never will; but when Viscount Ipsden falls in
with a brother aristocrat, who is crushed by the
fiend ennui, he remembers Aberford, and con-
denses his famous recipe into a two-edged
hexameter, which will make my learned reader
laugh, for it is full of wisdom.
“Diluculo surgas! miseris succurrere discas!!”
Flucker Johnstone meditated during break-
fast upon the five hundred pounds, and regretted
he had not, years ago, adopted Mr. Gatty's pro-
fession; some days afterwards he invited his sister
to a conference. Chairs being set, Mr. Flucker
laid down this observation—that near relations

a lady, it was repugnant to his sense of right to
be a fisherman and make her ladyship blush for
him; on the contrary, he felt it his duty to rise
to such high consideration that she should be
proud of him.
Christie acquiesced at once in this position,
but professed herself embarrassed to know how
such a "ne'er do weel” was to be made a source
of pride; then she kissed Flucker, and said, in a
tone somewhat inconsistent with the above, “Tell
me, my laamb!"
Her lamb informed her, that the sea has
many paths; some of them disgraceful, such as
line or net fishing, and the periodical laying
down, on rocky shoals, and taking up again, of
lobster-creels; others, superior to anything the
dry land can offer in importance and dignity and
general estimation, such as the command of a
merchant-vessel trading to the East or West
Indies. Her lamb then suggested that if she
would be so good as to launch him in the

merchant-service, with a good rig of clothes and
money in his pocket, there was that in his head
which would enable him to work to windward of
most of his contemporaries. He bade her cal-
culate upon the following results: in a year or
two he would be second mate—and next year,
first mate—and, in a few years more, skipper!
Think of that, lass! Skipper of a vessel, whose
rig he generously left his sister free to determine;
premising that two masts were, in his theory of
navigation, indispensable, and that three were a
great deal more like Cocker than two. This led
to a general consultation; Flucker's ambition was
discussed and praised. That modest young gen-
tleman, in spite of many injunctions to the con-
trary, communicated his sister's plans for him
to Lord Ipsden, and affected to doubt their
prudence. The bait took; Lord Ipsden wrote to
his man of business, and an unexpected blow
fell upon the ingenious Flucker. He was sent to
school; there to learn a little astronomy, a little
navigation, a little seamanship, a little manners,
&c.; in the mysteries of reading and writing his .

sister had already perfected him, by dint of “the
taws.” This school was a blow; but Flucker was
no fool: he saw there was no way of getting
from school to sea without working. So he
literally worked out to sea. His first voyage was
distinguished by the following peculiarities: at-
tempts to put tricks upon this particular novice
generally ended in the laugh turning against the
experimentors; and instead of drinking his grog,
which he hates, he secreted it, and sold it for
various advantages. He has been now four
voyages; when he comes ashore, instead of going
to haunts of folly and vice, he instantly bears up
for his sister's house-Kensington Gravel-pits-
which he makes in the following manner: he goes
up the river-Heaven knows where all—this he
calls running down the longitude; then he lands,
and bears down upon the Gravel-pits: in particular
knowledge of the names of streets he is deficient,
but he knows the exact bearings of Christie's
dwelling. He tacks and wears according as
masonry compels him, and he arrives at the
gate. He hails the house, in a voice that brings

all the inhabitants of the row to their windows,
including Christie; he is fallen upon and dragged
into the house. The first thing is, he draws out
from his boots, and his back, and other hiding
places, china crape and marvellous silk hand-
kerchiefs for Christie; and she takes from his
pocket a mass of Oriental sugar-plums, with
which, but for this precaution, she knows by
experience he would poison young Charley; and
soon he is to be seen, sitting with his hand in
his sister's, and she looking like a mother upon
his handsome weather-beaten face, and Gatty
opposite, adoring him as a specimen of male
beauty, and sometimes making furtive sketches
of him. And then the tales he always brings
with him; the house is never very dull, but it is
livelier than ever when this inexhaustible sailor
casts anchor in it.
The friends (chiefly artists) who used to leave
at 9.30, stay till eleven: for an intelligent sailor
is better company than two lawyers, two bishops,
three soldiers, and four writers of plays and
tales, all rolled together. And still he tells

Christie he shall command a vessel some day,
and leads her to the most cheering inferences
from the fact of his prudence and his general
width-awake; in particular he bids her contrast
with him the general fate of sailors, eaten up by
land-sharks, particularly of the female gender,
whom he demonstrates to be the worst enemies
poor Jack has; he calls these sunken rocks, fire-
ships, and other metaphors. He concludes thus:
“You are all the lass I mean to have, till I'm a
skipper, and then I'll bear up alongside some
pretty decent lass, like yourself, Christie, and
we'll sail in company all our lives, let the wind
blow high or low.” Such is the gracious Flucker
become in his twentieth year. Last voyage, with
Christie's aid, he produced a sextant of his own,
and “made it twelve o'clock” (with the sun's
consent, I hope), and the eyes of authority fell
upon him. So who knows, perhaps he may one
day sail a ship; and if he does, he will be prouder
and happier than if we made him monarch of
the globe.
To return to our chiefs: Mrs. Gatty gave her

formal consent to her son's marriage with Christie
Johnstone.
There were examples. Aristocracy had ere
now condescended to wealth; earls had married
women rich by tallow-importing papas; and, no
doubt had these same earls been consulted in
Gatty's case, they would have decided that
Christie Johnstone, with her real and funded
property, was not a villanous match for a green-
grocer's son, without a rapp;* but Mrs. Gatty
did not reason so,—did not reason at all, luckily,
her heart ran away with her judgment, and
her judgment ceasing to act, she became a wise
woman.
The case was peculiar. Gatty was an artist
pur sang,—and Christie, who would not have
been the wife for a petit maître, was the wife of
wives for him.
He wanted a beautiful wife to embellish his
canvass, disfigured hitherto by an injudicious
selection of models; a virtuous wife, to be his
crown; a prudent wife, to save him from ruin;

a cheerful wife, to sustain his spirits, drooping
at times by virtue of his artists temperament;
an intellectual wife, to preserve his children
from being born dolts, and bred dunces, and to
keep his own mind from sharpening to one
point, and so contracting and becoming mono-
maniacal: and he found all these qualities, to-
gether with the sun and moon of human ex-
istence-true love and true religion—in Christie
Johnstone.
In similar cases, foolish men have set to
work, to make, in six months, their diamond of
nature, the exact cut and gloss of other men's
pastes, and nervously watching the process, have
suffered torture; luckily Charles Gatty was not
wise enough for this; he saw nature had dis-
tinguished her he loved beyond her fellows;
here, as elsewhere, he had faith in nature, he
believed that Christie would charm every body
of eye, and ear, and mind, and heart, that
approached her; he admired her as she was, and
left her to polish herself, if she chose. He did
well: she came to London with a fine mind, a

broad brogue, a delicate ear; she observed how
her husband's friends spoke, and in a very few
months she had toned down her Scotch to a
rich Ionic colouring, which her womanly instinct
will never let her exchange for the thin, vinegar
accents that are too prevalent in English and
French society; and in other respects she caught,
by easy gradation, the tone of the new society
to which her marriage introduced her, without,
however, losing her charming self.
The wise dowager lodges hard by, having
resisted an invitation to be in the same house;
she comes to that house to assist the young wife
with her experience, and to be welcome,—not to
interfere every minute, and tease her; she loves
her daughter-in-law almost as much as she
does her son, and she is happy because he bids
fair to be an immortal painter, and, above all, a
gentleman, and she a wifely wife, a motherly mo-
ther, and, above all, a lady.
This, then, is a happy couple. Their life is
full of purpose and industry, yet lightened by
gaiety; they go to operas, theatres, and balls, for

they are young. They have plenty of society,
real society, not the ill-assorted collection of a
predetermined number of bodies, that blindly
assumes that name, but the rich communication
of various and fertile minds; they very, very
seldom consent to squat four mortal hours on
one chair (like old hares stiffening in their hot
forms), and nibbling, sipping, and twaddling, in
four mortal hours, what could have been eaten,
drunken, and said, in thirty-five minutes. They
are both artists at heart, and it shocks their
natures to see folks mix so very largely the in-
utile with the insipidum, and waste at one huge
but barren incubation, the soul, and the stomach,
and the irrevocable hours, things with which
so much is to be done. But they have many
desirable acquaintances, and not a few friends;
the latter are mostly lovers of truth in their
several departments, and in all things: among
them are painters, sculptors, engineers, writers,
conversers, thinkers; these acknowledging, even
in England, other gods besides the intestines,
meet often chez Gatty, chiefly for mental inter-

course; a cup of tea with such is found, by ex-
perience, to be better than a stalled elk, where
chit-chat reigns over the prostrate hours.
This, then, is a happy couple; the very
pigeons and the crows need not blush for the
nest at Kensington Gravel-pits. There the divine
institution Marriage takes its natural colours, and
it is at once pleasant and good to catch such
glimpses of Heaven's design, and sad to think
how often this great boon, accorded by God to
man and woman, must have been abused and
perverted, ere it could have sunk to be the
standing butt of farce writers, and the theme of
weekly punsters.
In this pair we see the wonders a male and
female can do for each other in the sweet bond
of holy wedlock. In that blessed relation alone
two interests are really one, and two hearts lie
safe at anchor side by side.
Christie and Charles are friends,- for they
are man and wife.
Christie and Charles are lovers still,—for they
are man and wife.


## p. 316 (#320) ############################################

CHRISTIE JOHNSTONE.
Christie and Charles are one for ever,—for
they are man and wife.
This wife brightens the house from kitchen
to garret, for her husband; this husband works
like a king for his wife's comfort, and for his
own fame,—and that fame is his wife's glory.
When one of these expresses or hints a wish, the
other's first impulse is to find the means, not the
objections.
They share all troubles, and by sharing, halve
them.
They share all pleasures, and by sharing
double them.
They climb the hill together now, and many
a canty day they shall have with one another;
and when, by the inevitable law, they begin
to descend towards the dark valley, they will
still go hand in hand, smiling so tenderly,
and supporting each other, with a care more
lovely than when the arm was strong and the
foot firm.
On these two temperate lives old age will
descend lightly, gradually, gently, and late,

and late upon these evergreen hearts, because
they are not tuned to some selfish, isolated
key; these hearts beat and ring with the young
hearts of their dear children, and years hence
papa and mamma will begin life hopefully, wish-
fully, warmly again with each loved novice in
turn.
And when old, age does come, it will be no
calamity to these, as it is to you, poor battered
beau, laughed at by the fair ninnies who erst
laughed with you; to you, poor follower of
salmon, fox, and pheasant, whose joints are
stiffening, whose nerve is gone,-whose Golgotha
remains; to you, poor faded beauty, who have
staked all upon man's appetite, and not ac-
cumulated goodness or sense for your second
course; to you, poor drawing-room wit, whose
sarcasm has turned to venom, and is turning to
drivel.
What terrors has old age for this happy pair?
it cannot make them ugly, for though the purple
light of youth recedes, a new kind of tranquil
beauty, the aloe-blossom of many years of in-

nocence, comes to, and sits like a dove upon the
aged faces, where goodness, sympathy, and in-
telligence have harboured together so long; and
where evil passions have fitted (for we are all
human), but found no resting-place.
Old age is no calamity to them, it cannot
terrify them; for ere they had been married a
week the woman taught the man, lover of truth,
to search for the highest and greatest truths, in
a book written for men's souls, by the Author
of the world, the sea, the stars, the sun, the soul;
and this book, Dei gratia, will, as the good
bishop sings,
“Teach them to live, that they may dread
The grave as little as their bed.”
It cannot make them sad, for ere it comes,
loved souls will have gone from earth, and from
their tender bosom, but not from their memories;
and will seem to beckon them now across the
cold valley, to the golden land.
It cannot make them sad, for on earth the
happiest must drink a sorrowful cup more than
once in a long life, and so their brightest hopes

will have come to dwell habitually on things
beyond the grave; and the great painter, jam
Senex, will chiefly meditate upon a richer land-
scape, and brighter figures than human hand
has ever painted; a scene whose glories he can
see from hence but by glimpses, and through a
glass darkly; the great meadows on the other
side of Jordan, which are bright with the spirits
of the just that walk there, and are warmed
with an eternal sun, and ring with the triumph
of the humble and the true, and the praises of
God for ever.
