SCHILLER'S Piccolomini.
It was a beautiful summer evening in an
English June, ere the glare and sultriness
of the day had yet sensibly abated, when
two youths of good quality-some eighteen,
apparently, or nineteen
of
scended from a postchaise at the door of the
Frederick and Pigtail, the principal inn of
Huntingferry, one of the prettiest towns in
Warwickshire, or, indeed, in all England.

The horses had evidently made a long
stage. The road by which the travellers
had entered the town was not-out of five
which traversed it in different directions-
the one leading from the races, some twelve
miles distant; a scene to which railway,
saddle horse, and carriage of all public or
private kinds and styles, had conveyed thou-
sands from every part of the country since
early morning, and whence no straggler had
hitherto returned to this neighbourhood. A
stillness unusual even in that tranquil place
made the clang of the chaise door a start-
ling sound, as the travellers, having quitted
it, looked round them, and stood for a
moment under the fretwork shade of the
two trees which supported the inn porch on
either hand. Athirst, ran on before it the
dusty road, which would not accept a change
of dress, nor take, even for a moment, the
customary costume of paving stones, which
such roads wear as they pass, in deference

to large towns; parched, yet eager and un-
beguiled, it rushed forward between the low
brick parapets of the bow-like bridge, and
climbed, under the blazing light, the long-
backed hill beyond.
Little thought they how that road would
make their hearts beat, ere many hours had
passed !
This road was pleasanter to gaze on than
to travel on, and grateful now felt the cool
inn-porch, beneath the bloomy luxuriance
of the ringleted eglantine ! pleasant even
the shady old-fashioned archway by its
side ; and the slow, lazy, irregular echo of
the jolting chaise, which—its purpose ful-
filled, its freight discharged—was rumbling
with a hollow sound into the yard behind.
But pleasanter than all, the voice of the
innkeeper, as he came out to welcome his
new guests.
He appeared in his shirt sleeves, and a
sudden alacrity which shone in his face

around him. The “chame maid's” bell, as
it vociferously jangled within, was almost
articulate, and the very bill which he waved
in his left hand was alive with greetings.

gazing abstractedly into the sea of dazzle
that lay outside the cool and cavernous
porch, here looked round.

Oh, you have saddle horses, then,

said, glancing at Parker.
“ I've one, sir; but he ain't mine, I'm
sorry to say; and if he was, sir,” added
Parker, "you two gentlemen couldn't both
ride him at once, like the picture in my

to the Temple family; so it was no use for

“ Who is his master, Parker ?" asked
Geoffrey, with interest.

But there was more interest still in the
look of his companion, who silently awaited
the innkeeper's reply to this query.
“ Well,” said Parker, “if you'll step
round after dinner into the yard, when the
gentleman's groom returns (he has locked
the stable and got the key with him), he'll
both show you the hanimal, and tell you
whose hanimal he's to be. He was Mr.
Childering's, that lives at the other side of
the county. But the groom tells me he is
sold to some rich London gentleman, a Mr.

there's a worth in it. Something worth.”
“Why, he's worth something, you say !”
The landlord was in the midst of a dutiful
burst of laughter, when he suddenly ceased,
with his mouth open, as Cuthbert said-
“Poor wit, Geoffrey, poor wit. There is
not any worth in that, at all events. But
you were telling us, landlord ?

a railway's one thing and a 'oss is another;
and if he's wise, he'll never go for to mount
that 'ere hanimal without making his will
first. I expect the gentleman what was the
former master this evening, from the races.'
• You have not heard which horse has
won ?” asked Cuthbert.
No, sir. It's too early yet to know that
in Huntingferry.”
“Very well,” observed Geoffrey ; " then
you go and see what we can have for dinner
by-and-by, say at half-past six; we will
stroll out and amuse ourselves in the mean-
time. But, first, let us wash our hands."
“ I'll see to it at once, sir. Here, Alice!”
The chambermaid, who, during this short
conversation, had stood a little behind the
master of the house, asked the young gentle-
men to follow her, and tripped lightly up-
stairs, to show them a room for the purpose

which Geoffrey had mentioned. Cuthbert,
who was restless to learn the issue of the
races, had soon finished; he urged his friend
to make haste, and they were presently in
the main street of the little town. No
decisive intelligence had yet arrived, al-
though certain flying rumours, like those
which shook the soul of Brussels on that
wet and gloomy Sunday in 1815, had suf-
ficed to collect a few groups on the shady
side of the otherwise deserted street. But
their talk was languid, and the excitement
feeble, like the last outside ripple of the
water when the plunge of a stone sends the
receding circles to trace themselves further
and further from the spot into which it is
cast. It was easy to see that these groups,
left behind out of a whole population, had
caught up a sort of secondary interest in
the races. As Geoffrey and Cuthbert passed,
they opened out and saluted the former,
whose name had transpired from the inn.


## p. 13 (#29) ##############################################

THE MONEY-SPINNER. 13
Halting at one of these greetings, the two
young men learned that the group knew
nothing, but that Mr. Owen, the saddler,
across the bridge, always obtained the first
news of the event. They proceeded thither
at once; the personage whom they sought
was, however, still ignorant of the result.
They then determined to call upon him
again after dining, and having looked at
everything which seemed at all remarkable
in the little town, they returned to the
inn.
They had dined, and were sipping the
claret of which their host had predicted
their approbation.
"Well, then," said Geoffrey Mandeville,
in continuation of some persuasions which
he had been addressing to his friend, "we
may consider that matter settled. You will
sleep this night, at least, under my father's
roof; and, if nothing can induce you to
delay your return home, I'll drive you over

of the place where you live? You know
it is only ten miles beyond Mandeville
Park."
“Lea Meadows,” replied Cuthbert, redden-
ing " It is not so well known as Mande-
ville Park, nor are we Hardings so well
known as the Mandevilles, who came over
with the Conqueror, and, according to an
old English report, found us here when they
You have often spoken of your
family.”
He paused a moment, pressing and almost
puckering his lips together, as was his wont
when silent. A sort of frown contracted a
forehead singularly massive and pallid,
while his nostrils were dilated with a motion
peculiar to a certain class of countenance.
“In fact,” he added, "I am not sure,
though very thankful to you that—that,"

“That what?”
"That we are at Eton no longer. There

A vivid glance shot from the dark grey
eyes of Cuthbert.
“You see, it is become a case of Mande-
ville Park and Lea Meadows. But I'm very
stupid, and I know you are most kind—that
is why you insist on this plan of yours.
But how do I know that Sir Walter and
Lady Mandeville—what, if I remember the
case of that poor, broken-spirited Tom Fal-
coner, who went with an Eton friend, being
otherwise uninvited, to pass last Christmas

all, Mandeville Park is on my way.
“Of course you'll come, and there's an
end of it, as you say. And now I suppose
that Parker will have discovered the horses
for us."
And Geoffrey rang the bell. The landlord
answered it himself; but there was a rueful
look on his countenance as he entered, and,
with many apologies, he explained that he
found himself unable to accommodate them
according to his wishes and intentions. He
had but one horse after all, and that one
scarcely able to stir.
He had sent all over
the neighbourhood to beg, borrow, or hire
another. Such a thing hadn't happened to
him for the twenty-seven years he was in
the Frederick and Pigtail, and to think that
the first sufferer should be the son of Sir
Walter Mandeville, the son of his earliest
and best patron! It was, he repeated, all

crosslike just at that very moment.
moment. Doubt-
less, a little further on in the evening, he
might manage. He would suggest to Mr.
Geoffrey and his friend another bottle of
claret in the meantime. This they declined ;
and Geoffrey asked for the bill, which he
settled, telling the landlord forthwith to
order the one-horse fly round.
“Put our things upon it, and let it pro-
ceed at once along the road to the Park,"
added Geoffrey. “Come, Cuthbert, we may
as well stroll on at once. The chaise will
overtake us.
The host withdrew to give orders accord-
ingly.
We have noted the preceding circum-
stances carefully, slowly, and somewhat
minutely, because, notwithstanding their
apparent triviality, it will be found that
they exercised a painfully important bearing
on the events which rapidly followed.

As Geoffrey, putting on his hat, was about
to leave the room, Cuthbert took out his
purse.
“You have paid all,” he said, “half is my
debt-we are still merely travelling."
“ Pooh! nonsense, Cuthbert; you know
I'm much richer than you—you'll offend me.”
The pale face of the boy to whom this
rudely kind speech was addressed, became
suddenly flushed ; his mouth, which was
handsome, but thin lipped, writhed; but
the expression quickly passed into a smile,
which seemed to correct or contradict the
hasty gleam from the dark grey eyes, and
the momentary contraction of the massive
brows. Geoffrey observed nothing of this.
“As you please,” said Cuthbert; “but,
talking of money, we have both of us some-
thing on to-day's races, some bets together,
and some bets with others. It must be
known by this time which horse has won the
last running.”

Thus talking, they had descended the
stairs, and exchanging greetings with the
landlord, who awaited them in the low
ceilinged, antler-hung hall, and who enfiladed
them with a raking fire of Eastern salaams
rather than English bows, they sallied forth
upon their walk—the one-horse fly to over-
take them, as ordered.
They found, first query, that, an outsider
having won, and Geoffrey having backed the
favourite, he had lost a few pounds. Cuth-
bert remarked, after glancing at some
memoranda, that he was very considerably
a winner.
“In fact,” added he, “I could not well
have lost; there were only two combinations
out of thirty-five against me; I stood to
gain at least twelve pounds in any other

“I dare say not,” replied Cuthbert,
quietly; “but, though I'm not rich, you
know I have, in my turn, a sort of pull over
you."
"You mean that I'm not clever," said
Geoffrey, with a highly offended air: “I
know that

well.”
“No, no, no," answered Cuthbert, after a
glance keen and rapid. “I don't mean any
such thing. I meant that you seldom take
any trouble ; and

don't need it as I do.

There's not much to win or lose on mere
horses ; at least, 'tis a life in itself, and such

“As to that,” laughed Cuthbert, “ I could
ride almost before I could walk, and the
bone doesn't forget what the gristle learned.”
They had now reached the upper end of
the little town, lounging slowly along the
middle of the road, when Geoffrey, happen-
ing to look back, stood suddenly still, and
then exclaimed
“Hollo! there's the white nag of our
postboy at the door of Wilson, the chemist's
shop. What the deuce brings him there?
I hope nobody is ill at the Park.”
At this they turned, and, ascending the
whole length of the street, entered the shop.

Inside they found the chemist, a fussy,
loquacious little man, in the act of labelling
some phials behind his counter ; against

Although he was a postboy, yet, contrary to
a great principle of logic, he was not a boy
at all, but a light, spare, wizened, oldish
man, with a sandy-coloured face, in the skin
of which there were as many little lines as
in Russian leather. He wore a peak cap,
and was lazily masticating the stalk of a
rose, as if he had been smoking a pipe of
which the flower was the bowl. There was
also in the shop a little boy, who seemed,
like Saunders, to be waiting for some pre-
scription.
On Geoffrey's entrance, he was immedi-
ately recognized and saluted with great
respect by the messenger from the Park,
who took the cap from his head and the rose

from his mouth. In answer to the young
gentleman's inquiry, Saunders replied that
the medicine which Mr. Wilson was pre-
paring, was for Lady Mandeville.
“Is my mother unwell, then ?” asked
Geoffrey, in alarm : “my letters told me
nothing of it!"
"Not to say unwell, sir; only a little ill-
disposed. My lady is up, and looking in
nearly her usual health, as I heard the butler
say. I think ’tis a perwentive, sir, that
my
lady is sending for."
“I wish,” muttered Geoffrey, “my mother
would be persuaded to leave off this eternal
quacking.”
Mr. Wilson, the chemist, who had caught
the word quacking, here observed, with an
air slightly offended or, as it were, dignified
and respectfully explanatory, that Mr. Geof-
frey need not entertain any apprehension.
Lady Mandeville was somewhat dyspeptic,
and was suffering from a loss of appetite.

He had no doubt that the mixture which he
had made up, and to which her ladyship was
well accustomed, would restore her tone.
He then remarked upon the weather, the
races, the Emperor of Russia, and the won-
ders of table rapping, with placid volubility,
proceeding meantime with the labelling and
equipping of two bottles and of a pillbox.
“I have written the directions,” he said,
although he was still writing rapidly while
he spoke. “One half of the mixture this

day or two. The other half of the mixture

He then handed one bottle and the little
box to Saunders, the other bottle he gave to
the small boy already mentioned, saying,
“ Here is the cleaning mixture, my lad, for

added, turning to Geoffrey, " are so apt to
taste whatever comes in their way, sir.”
“I'm sure I don't want to taste your
things,” said the urchin, darting off with his
phial in the direction of the bridge, the
same which the two young men had been
pursuing, when the sight of the white pony
induced them to return.
Meanwhile, Saunders mounted that ani-
mal, having thrust the medicines for which
he had come into his pocket.
“ Make haste, Saunders !” said Geoffrey ;
“I hope they will not have waited dinner
for us. Explain that we could get no horses
in this place when we arrived, and we have
dined while waiting for them. We shall be
at the Park not very long after you reach it
yourself.”

ought to be there !

Saunders cantered away with his message,
and the two friends followed on foot at a
leisurely pace.
As they passed the inn,
they learnt that the fly had not yet gone on,

All this took
a little time, and a little more was lost at
the bridge, where they stopped a few mo-
ments to gaze down the pretty vale through
which the stream beneath them went spark-
ling. It was a lovely evening—they were
not in a hurry—the view was charming-
and here they loitered, leaning on the para-
pet, while they lit a cigar. This done, they
resumed their journey.

ACROSS the bridge rose the long and gradual
hill to which the innkeeper had drawn
their attention, when praising what he
styled his “conservatory room,” a flowery
projecting balcony, suspended, like the an-
cient hanging gardens of Babylon, over the
rushing waters ;-and, upon the first slope
of this hill, the fag end or suburb of the
little town had fixed itself.
Here were
situated the saddler's and harness-maker's
shop, to which the boy had just fetched
from Mr. Wilson's—while Geoffrey and

Cuthbert were there—the cleaning mixture,
or what the chemist intended for such.
The shop in question was decidedly the most
flourishing establishment which the pleasant
town of Huntingferry boasted.
Cuthbert and Geoffrey were examining,
ere they passed on, the whips and other
articles displayed in the broad, low window,
when Mr. Owen himself appeared in the
doorway with the same lad whom they had
seen at the chemist's. He was pushing the
child with both hands, or, rather, was in act
to push—the lad being equally in act to
dart away, and looking round merely to
hear his master's parting orders before a
good vigorous rush.
“ Tell Mr. Wilson," said the saddler,
that I don't know how he can be so stupid
-that this is not the cleaning mixture, but
some medicine stuff. Let him change it for
you at once, and you run back here im-
mediately.”

The urchin flew off as he was bidden.
We may observe that, at this moment,
the white horse of Saunders, the letter-
carrier, could be seen by Geoffrey and
Cuthbert standing clear out against the
sky line, on the summit of the long hill
before them. The next instant he disap-
peared behind the ridge. They were about
to lounge forward in the same direction,
when the saddler, saluting them, engaged
their attention.
“A sweet evening, gentlemen,” observed
he, thrusting his hands into his trouser's
pockets, and inhaling with zest the balmy
air; “so Nugget has won, after all !”
“Yes, confound him !” said Geoffrey.
“Nugget has won-who'd have thought it ?”
Few, sir, did think it,” returned the
saddler. “Some bets, sir, I presume ?”
Yes, on the favourite."

opinion being always right, sir ; public

Public opinion, sir, is not a
prophet. How Mr. Bloundel has lost, to be
sure !”
Not being under the necessity of making
more progress than they chose till the fly
overtook them, and probably feeling the
lazy influence of that delicious evening, the
two friends lingered, for a few moments, to
hear the disjointed gossip which Mr. Owen
proceeded to retail to them about the
Course. , In the midst of his communi-

to tell ; "yes, sir, but Mr. Wilson wouldn't
give me anything; but when he saw the
bottle he said he was ruined, and then he
began to tear his hair what's on the side of
his head, and said as how he had sent you
Lady Mandeville's mixture, and that there
would be murder at the Park, for that he
gave Saunders the poison by mistake, and
that it had no colour or smell no more than
the mixture, and then he took down some
bottles, and ran out of the shop without
his hat, and I saw him run into Mr. Parker's
inn—and that's all.”
“And enough too !” cried the saddler.
Geoffrey stood for a moment, pale, silent,
and horror-stricken. He then exclaimed,
with a truly scared aspect-
“ Saunders must be two miles on the road
already ; he is riding fast; it is out of the
question to overtake him with the fly and
that worn-out horse. My mother is to

take the medicine half an hour after dinner.
Good Heavens! it will be as soon as
Saunders arrives—they dine at eight! What
is to be done?”
At this moment, the fly which had been
ordered to follow the two young gentlemen
came thundering furiously over the bridge,
with their luggage piled on the roof. The
driver was lashing the jaded animal, which
strained along painfully, but stoutly. Inside
sat a man pale as a corpse, and staring with
a wild and haggard expression. On seeing
Geoffrey and Cuthbert on the side of the
road, the driver pulled suddenly up, while
the man inside the vehicle uttered an ex-
clamation of horror, and hid his face in his
hands. It was the unfortunate chemist,
who having discerned the fatal blunder of
which he had been guilty, had delayed but
to provide himself with the stomach pump
and other remedies, and had rushed to the
inn to procure some conveyance. At the

door of that establishment he had found
the fly, ready to start for the Park. He
hastily explained the case to the landlord,
who, having at his disposal, as the reader
knows, only the horse then and there
harnessed, and no other present means
whatever of speeding the apothecary to his
destination, shoved him forth with into the
vehicle, and bade the postboy gallop the
whole way though he killed the horse.
With as little delay as Mr. Wilson's own
self-accusatory interjections had unavoid-
ably caused, all this was explained in
answer to the rapid questions put by
Cuthbert, who then ascertained that the
apothecary had all the necessary remedies
in a paper parcel, to which he pointed be-
side him on the seat.
Cuthbert seemed an inch taller : turning
to his friend, who was stamping about with
frantic gestures-

of the whole, to run on foot. Leave the
rest to me.
I'll be there before you, and
before Saunders. I'll get Childering's horse

courage, Geoffrey.”
Away went the vehicle, while he was yet
speaking, as if his voice had electrified the
driver and Geoffrey, who urged the horse
into the rickety gallop of which alone it
was capable.
Cuthbert no sooner saw them off than he
turned to Mr. Owen,
“Do you know Mr. Childering's horse ? "
he said. “Dare I ride him in a snaffle ?
You had better give me, at need, a bridle
and bit on which I may confidently rely.”

if he had been actually prepared for the
order, although, in truth, he had not ex-
pected it, rushed, without saying a word,
into his back shop, and presently returned
with a bit containing a lower bar, curb
chain, and double-reined bridle, which he
gave to Cuthbert.
While the latter was
considering them, Owen observed -
“I don't know this horse, sir; but Mr.
Childering is the best and boldest rider in
the county—he always prefers my bridles,
and according to his experience with that
particular pattern which you now have in
your hand, you are master of any horse on
the forward, whether he yet have his mouth
or not. Of course, you would be cautious
of bringing him down.”
But Cuthbert was already moving away.

was next door but one on this side of the

bridle over his arm, and entered the stithy.
The saddler, urged by the interest and
excitement which had gained upon him,
glanced nervously along the road, in the
opposite direction, and saw the fly still
labouring furiously up the hill, enveloped in
dust, and fast nearing the summit. He
then, without waiting to get his hat,
wrapped his coloured pocket handkerchief
around his hat, to protect him from the
westering sun, which was still powerful, and
pursued Cuthbert across the bridge. He
saw this last emerge, in great haste, from
the smithy, followed by a man carrying
some instruments; he saw him stride, still
followed by the smith, to the inn door,
where Parker was standing, surrounded by
a group of listeners, to whom he was doubt-
less relating what had befallen at the
chemist's shop, and leaving them to calcu-
late what would soon befall at Mandeville

Park. Mr. Owen, seeing Parker lift up
his
hands, as if in boundless astonishment, at
the first words which Cuthbert addressed to
him, could restrain his curiosity and im-
patience no longer, but fairly ran over the
intervening space till he made one of the
little crowd outside the Frederick and Pig-
tail. As he arrived, Cuthbert was speaking;
his manner was resolute in the extreme, but
not excited; he was calm, with, however,
something dangerous in his look.
“ You mentioned that before,” he said,
“to my friend, Mr. Geoffrey Mandeville.
The horse is not yours.
I'll answer for the

mentioned that too. Look you, time is life

“Why don't you do as the gentleman
says ? ” interposed mine host's wife, now for
the first time appearing. “Follow me, sir;
I'll show you the stable !” and, as she
forced her way out into the porch, she con-
tinued, with reverted head: “I am ashamed
of you, John; and Lady Mandeville, poor
dear lady, going to be poisoned !”
Parker, at this, hurried down the archway
at the side of the inn, followed by Cuthbert,
the smith, and the crowd. As he proceeded
(time not being any longer lost, Cuthbert
now ungrudgingly allowed him to vent all
his sentiments freely), mine host gave utter-
ance to the thoughts which clashed with
each other in his mind.
Well, certainly, if the smith be here, sir

case enough. Any one may see that. But
it would be useless to ask me to mount that
’ere hanimal, were it never so ! I wouldn't
save the queen's neck by a riding of him-
no, that I wouldn't.”
All this time, I say, they were making
progress through the back yards, and Cuth-
bert's good humour had returned. He
said
“No, honest Parker, you would break
your own by such an experiment. But I
see the stable, where that little boy, who
ran on before us, is standing. I thought so;
you need not come any further.”
While the smith was picking the lock,
Cuthbert desired the crowd to fall back
from the door, in order not to excite the
animal needlessly by the noise of voices.

He then took off his neckcloth, and
belted it round his waist, the crowd watch-
ing his every movement with intense interest
and excitement, and becoming suddenly
silent on witnessing this last.
The door was opened in a few seconds,
and Cuthbert entered the stable with the
ostler, to whom he handed the bridle which
he had brought from Mr. Owen's. Scarcely
a minute, though it seemed a far longer
period to the expectant groups, elapsed, ere
the
young man reappeared in the yard. He
was followed by the ostler, who led out a
noble chestnut horse, plunging violently.
Cuthbert, pulling his hat firmly down on
his brows, approached him, patted him on
the neck, spoke to him soothingly, and
arranged the stirrup leathers to the length
which he desired, judging as well as he
could by the eye. This, however, was the
longest operation of all. It was both diffi-
cult to take, and dangerous to retain, the

splendid animal, meantime, as he fretted
rapidly round the yard in the ostler's hold,
was not lost upon Cuthbert, who asked the
ostler whether he was not a “buck jumper.”
Why, sir, I believe he's every kind of
jumper ; but, once off, he is fast enough.

of the horse, and his mind vigilant and
intent to make

dancing motion, his neck arched, his eye-
balls glaring, his whole frame trembling
with mettle and excitement. But, when
his rider would bring him to the entrance of
the yard, where the little crowd, which had
been somewhat increased, was nestling in a
corner near the gate, the horse suddenly
swerved with violence, and turning fairly
round, made a bolt towards the stable.
Mastered by one sharp but temperate touch
of the powerful nether rein, he reared almost
to the perpendicular, and then broke into a
series of furious plunges, writhing the back
with that peculiar motion which renders it
impossible to all but a very rare horseman
to keep the suddle. Now began that contest
which is at the same time so beautiful and
so terrible to behold, between a mighty
steed in all his disdain, spirit, and strength,
refusing the mastery of man, and a fearless
rider determined to impose it.

yard, which communicated, by a low, broad
gate, now open, with the outer yard, from
which the archway led out into the street.
It was near this open gate, on the further
side, that the innkeeper and the rest of the
spectators had gathered, and were still stand-
ing. At this moment the clock of the town
church rang the three-quarters past eight.
“ It is too fast, sir-five minutes too fast!”
cried the innkeeper.
Cuthbert perceived that while the group
remained near the gate, it would be a slow
and almost hopeless attempt to get his horse
through. He called out to them to with-
draw. They had hardly done so when, as
he was borne towards the opening, in a suc-
cession of sidelong, curveting, bounding
plunges, like a weatherly craft upon a strain-
ing tack in a storm, a man in the smart
livery of a gentleman's groom appeared sud-
denly running to the gateway, across the
further or outer yard.

“Hollo! young gentleman !” he cried
out, closing the gate, are you tired of your
existence?"
“Have a care of your own 1” shouted
Cuthbert, as the animal, shying at the clang
of the closing gate, again wheeled violently,
and bore him to the rear;
“ have a care of
your own !”
The groom climbed over the gate into the
inner yard.
“Come, sir,” he said, approaching ; "you
just get down off that horse, if you please ;
he's in my care. By the law !” added the
groom, with a terrified look, “he'll be killed
off-hand.”
This exclamation was elicited by a new
and tremendous effort of the steed to throw
his dauntless rider. Shaking his neck, and
slightly dipping his head, he flung himself
into the air, off all four feet at the same
moment. But Cuthbert's blood was up.

progress of the desperate struggle seemed

but to raise within him the true spirit of
buoyant energy and “derring dee.”
“Oh!” he cried to the groom, “I'll give
him leave to throw me!”
And then, shaking the reins and settling
himself well in the saddle, he uttered a kind
of loud defiant cheer or laugh—it might be
either— to which the horse seemed almost to
reply, for, as if tired of his unavailing
struggles, or at length satisfied that he bore
a rider worthy of him, he raised a sharp,
whinnying neigh, and sprang forward. The
low gate was still closed, and they went
easily and flowingly over it, while the groom
stood gazing from the other side, like one in
a dream. Obeying the band, the noble
animal bent a little to the right, and swept
gracefully and lightly under the archway
into the street, and then towards the bridge
in an increasing gallop.
The pace still mended as he came to the
foot of the hill; the generous brute, no

sooner perceiving the long vista of the
adverse rise, which seemed to be delaying
his
progress, than he put forth all his trans-
cendent vigour. Now he compensated for
his previous recalcitrance. As if he had
become at last aware that some high and
gallant interest depended upon his fleetness
that evening—as if he knew that, on this
occasion, or never, he was bound to show
what he was worth-as if he had sympa-
thetically caught the fiery solicitude and
eagerness of his rider—he scarcely seemed
to touch the long, dusty ascent up which he
dashed. The fly had for some minutes dis-
appeared behind the summit of the hill, ere
Cuthbert had been borne with a sound of
receding thunder from the hearing of those
who watched his departure. The landlord
had hastened upstairs to the balcony of the
room where Geoffrey Mandeville and his
friend had dined. There he found his wife

in their wealth of summer foliage, nor the
bright tints, nor the peaceful evening pros-

looking forth again, exclaimed-

chair of darkly resplendent Spanish oak,
which now guarded its place at the head
of the table, had once sat, as master of the
mansion and the estates of the Mandevilles,
their maternal ancestor—the gentlest, the
most skilful, and the bravest of all the chiefs
whose deeds are recorded in the honour-
worshipping chronicles of Froissart ; that
hall now blazed with chandeliers in the
centre, glittered with gold and silver plate
upon the massive buffets at the sides, and

The architecture was Gothic, and at every
turn-protruding from cornices, and perched

you some hideous countenance; as though
the dreaming stone had broken into a

with listening attitude to the breeze ; while
some stood singly aloof, in majestic attitude,
surveying the diversified and imposing scene
around them. A boat slept over its own
shadow on a grove-margined sapphire pool,

woods of larger timber, so patches of fern
diapered, in one or two spots, the richer
sward. Among the shadows, or athwart
the yellow stripes of the evening sunshine
in the glades, moved capriciously the troops
of deer, under their antlered captains. Over
all, upon the summit of several convergent,
terrace-like hills, at the highest, or nearly

bright helmet of many towers to the clouds ;

Two or three ladies were around her. They
were in evening costume, but yet seemed to
form a familiar group.
Their dress and
occupations blended the forms of a stately
sphere with the effects of that domestic
influence which the character and habits of
their hostess exhaled. She never could seem
otherwise than the great territorial princess ;
but, at the same time, all around her
breathed of home and home tastes. A piano
and a harp were near. By her side stood
a work-table, and she was engaged in some
embroidery. Five or six other ladies were
present.
Her guests, like the reader, were
aware that she felt somewhat unwell; and,
accordingly, the usual glance which tele-
graphs among the fair sex the signal of
retirement from table, had passed almost
as soon as the dessert began to circulate.
“I like coming away early,” said Mrs.
Finchley, the parson's wife.

The speaker was a darkly-beautiful young
woman with a pale complexion. She seemed
about twenty. Lady Mandeville flushed to
the temples, a tear stood in her eyes, and
her whole face glowed with mingled plea-

charming and lovely woman, some ten years
older than Madame de Sainte Seine-that

love. The love he fully reciprocated, and,
indeed, the admiration also, though it was
of a totally different kind; for this quality,

it covers.
He admired her gentle heart,
her lofty principles, her noble and disinter-

intelligent, full of taste, singularly feminine,

ster, it had not come into her head to pre-
tend that she was. Men, and especially
able men, wish for the woman in the wife;
it is weak, but natural. Sir Walter believed
that his wife was and would continue to be
feminine, and she never disappointed his
calculation. We are aware that the taste
we here ascribe to most men, and in a
special manner to men of ability, is very
spiritless, mean, and despicable ; and that

As might be expected from the prevalence
of this base prejudice, few male-minded
ladies find their opportunity to marry.
When they do, the husband is tempted to
prefer an amicable talk with any other lady
“discussion” with his wife. Lady
Mandeville was not of the class here indi-
cated. In order to hide her pleasurable
confusion at Madame de Sainte Seine's
allusion to Sir Walter's renown, she took
advantage of the reference to her daughter,
Henrietta, to ask-

The words were hardly uttered when
there entered a beautiful girl of about ten.
Her figure was slight and delicate. The
expression of the face was pensive. She
was fair, like her mother; the forehead oval,
elegant, and of
snowy whiteness; the
eyes
dark blue; the tresses a pale gold, which
would yet deepen into a rich soft brown.
At present, as she moved her graceful
throat, a faint brightness, like a halo, shim-
mered from the glossy curls—a cascade of
rays which never seemed to settle, but
always to be falling, and, as it were,
vanishing around the beauteous
young
head.
“And where have you been this beautiful

At this moment the servant entered with

He placed the tray on a table by Lady

“Saunders has brought this, my lady.
He saw Mr. Geoffrey at Huntingferry ; but
there was no horse to be had in the town

glass towards Lady Mandeville, who took it
mechanically.
She was in the act of raising it to her lips,
when a scream from Mrs. Finchley arrested
her. Following the direction of that lady's
gaze, she saw that the door had been thrown
violently open. In the aperture stood the
groom of the chambers, past whom had
rushed a young man-bare throated, his
handkerchief belted round his waist, his hair
dishevelled, his face dark with dust and
perspiration, his forehead stained with blood.
At this sudden apparition, another but
slight scream escaped Mrs. Finchley, who
happened to be sitting with her face towards
the door. The rest of the ladies turned.

stranger, had scanned with a quick glance

words.
The youth who had so strangely broken
into the stately circle stood in front of Lady
Mandeville, with one hand pressed to his
side, and the other grasping the phial, which
he examined curiously: he was panting, as
if he would gain breath to speak.
“Who are you, sir ? And what is your
business here ?" said the lady of the house.

No; I have not yet tasted it.”
The expression of his face changed: he
staggered towards a chair instinctively, and
catching the back of it, as if to support him-
self, although he still stood with a not un-

bold-featured and handsome speaker. A

Little Henrietta threw her arms round

“Then you are Mr. Harding, my son

Henrietta withdrew her hand shyly, and

of the chambers through the great vestibule
already described. His sudden and strange
task was accomplished. His mind was now
free. He paused and looked around and
above. Many a tint fell upon the head and
shoulders of the servant who preceded him.
He sought their origin. The stained and
storied Gothic windows; the
torch
bearers ; the conflict of the ordinary light
which these dispensed with the coloured
light of evening, filtered through the lofty
casements; the suits of old armour; the
armed and pedestalled figures of another
age; the statues, the busts, and the paintings
(of which some large and noble specimens
adorned the walls of this immense vestibule);
the palatial double staircase of polished and
slippery oak, supported by massive balusters
of the same wood, elaborately carved—the

bined effects, produced a powerful impression

Through it seemed to come a vision of the
stately scene behind, with its air of, till
then, unwitnessed refinement and splendour.
All this occurred in a second. He sighed,
compressed his lips, and raised a hand to
his forehead. He felt confused, however, as
he observed that the servant was looking
round.
“ Have you dined, sir ?”
“Yes, at Huntingferry. So has Mr.
Geoffrey. But I should like a biscuit and
some wine after I have washed and dressed,"
thrusting a hand through his hair.
« Would

“ Yes; and I will stay in it till the chaise

orders that the horse be carefully looked to.

“No ; you could not have heard anything

Oh, sir,-if that be the horse, I do

But Cuthbert had asked without caring
for the answer, merely because, as he ima-
gined, he had seen the servant watching the
effect produced upon his mind by the un-
wonted magnificence around him. The
man was too much used to that magnifi-
cence, and too little acquainted with the
youth's character or circumstances, to have
entertained any such thoughts. Cuthbert's
ear was caught by a word which the servant

whether the chaise had not come.

Cuthbert was soon dressed ; and, surveying
himself in a cheval glass, which stood back
upon its proper inclined plane, beneath two
wax lights, attached to it in projecting
sconces, he was agreeably saluted by the
marvellous change in his appearance. The
exertion he had undergone, the suspense

capable of even thinking with precision or

nature of the service it had thus fallen to
his lot to render to a great family—com-
bined to give an animation, a dignity, and
even a nobleness, to a person which was
naturally elegant, to a face which was hand-

air eminently bold, gallant, and engaging.
He stood for a moment before the mirror,
and said, with a smile-
« Ah ! I see that I am a man. This
morning I was only a schoolboy.”
Then, suddenly, a dark, cold, and wary
look stole like a cloud over the momentary
radiance which had illumined his face.
He glanced musingly around the walls,
which, even in this bath room, presented
everywhere the tokens of a union between
wealth, personal refinement, and hereditary
honours.

He soon found the value of it when he went
to Hazlebury. I might have read, but what
then ? I thought money was the thing.
Clear, it gave a fellow a great swing.
Geoffrey always had lots of pocket money;
it was hard to see the position one got by
spending it; for, after all, it is not the
having—it is the spending. Well! I found
out how to make a book. That pulled me
up the leeway, until this last year. Then,
in the debates, again, I succeeded; and
Geoffrey could never open his lips, without
making himself absurd. Everything after
this, and after my bookkeeping, ha! ha!
went well, till this last year. Somehow,
positions seemed to change then. Fellows
began to think what each fellow was to be,
immediately after leaving Eton.

Geoffrey began to be a fellow of high con-
sequence, though I'll do him justice, he never
changed a bit himself. But those around us
did, and what a difference it seemed to make
when it was known that I was to come here
with Geoffrey—that I was to be introduced
to his mother and to Sir Walter--that I was
to spend some days with them. Spend some

I don't know one thing in which he can
pretend to equal me. But where's the use
of my superiority? Why, the very last
year, after I had taken the lead of him in
every mortal kind of trial—from books,
while I cared for them, to the boat on the
river-he comes suddenly out upon us as
heir of Sir Walter Mandeville, of Mandeville
Park. Heir! That's part of him, I sup-
pose! But he did not make his father, and
I cannot make mine. What merit is it of
Geoffrey's that he has an ancestor, called Sir
Joceline, who went to the Crusades six
hundred years ago ? Did Geoffrey send
him? Is all this fair? Good Heavens ! to
think that such a circumstance should make

he'll propose next that some of the ladies

He took a turn up and down the exquisite
little bath-room, and halted, with folded
arms, at the Gothic window, from which he
drew back the curtain, and raised the blind.
Outside ran an esplanade, separated from
the park by an ornamental, open-worked,

mimic moat, and on the hither side, a
terraced gravel walk. At the left of the
esplanade, a corner of the garden hedge,

'Well,” said Geoffrey, “I perceive there

stood in each corner, within the recess of the
window. On a round table, in the centre
of the apartment, two wax lights were set.
The door of this room was closed, and the
window was still unshuttered and uncur-
tained. Here, half turned towards the room,
and half towards a lovely view which, from
this lofty chamber in the great tower, un-
rolled itself for miles beneath them in the
moonlight, the friends took their station.
When each had filled his glass, and helped
himself to some grapes, Geoffrey said —
Well, you must know that if I have

had to satisfy ten thousand questions about
you. But I could tell only part of the
story. I knew not what had occurred at

he meant to pick you up.
“Oh! depend upon it,” interposed Cuth-

was anxious to pick up the horse. That

If I was killed, he lost nothing ; if the horse
was killed, he lost a couple of hundred
guineas, or so—perhaps twice the sum.”

sipping his wine, like one who enjoyed it.

of time that can easily be conceived. I had
literally not three seconds to spare.
The
man at the lodge, most fortunately, was
talking lazily to some person—a gamekeeper,
he looked—as I came up, and he had not
yet closed the gate again, which he had
opened just before to let

As I burst past him, upon the lawn I saw
the white pony being led round the house
to the stables. I believe I uttered some
cry which Childering's noble horse—I wish
he were mine-seemed to understand ; for I
felt myself heaved upwards and onwards as
if upon a wave at sea; he appeared to
devour the whole intervening lawn, and my
very breath was taken away by his last
tremendous rush. Saunders himself, halted,
turned, and met me to catch the reins, as
I flung myself off at the door.”

“ Understand me," said Sir Walter. “I

I am sure, for there is no better authority
than yourself that the South Central will
realize, under your auspices, the immense
profits you predict. But, as I happen to
know the proposed line well, and as there is
no physical possibility, either along its
course, or at the two points which it is to
connect, of any adequate paying traffic for
the next half century, it is perfectly evident
that the line itself will be abandoned
speedily, and will therefore entail ruinous
loss on the last purchasers of the shares.

have told me of a cigar smoked before
breakfast), sauntered forth into the Park,
while still the house was quiet, to indulge in
various tobacco-shaded reflections, undis-
turbed by the importunity of friendship.

Who can say what were those reflections ?
Never mind reflections," thinks the reader
-"you just go on with your story ; tell us
what happened, as you hitherto have told
it; the incidents and facts and whole outside
picture of the things—these are our object.”
I will obey ; but I am so docile only
because I have no choice. Were it possible
for me to lift the veil from the hearts of all
my
characters in a more direct manner than
by relating what befel them, what they did,
and what they suffered, how much more
enthrallingly interesting than any tale of
the mere result—the external, material con-
sequences — would be that strange and
wondrous spectacle! All the stories of all
the lives on earth are first traced up to a
certain mysterious chapter (where the writing
ceases or changes), on that inner book, the
heart and brain of man.

think and feel; and on what we do, in its

point. For, look you, Providence, knowing
,
also what all other persons will do, and even
arranging the instruments of inanimate
nature around us, so as to favour the success
of some attempts, and to insure the failure
of others, meets us at that point (the point
of which I speak, where the first hand-
writing on that inner book ceases), and
takes
up
the remainder of the tale in
characters of its own, not to be deciphered,
save by the light of the result. That
ulterior, undecipherable chapter is each
person's future. Attempts, then, alone are
left to us ; the issues are beyond our
mastery. Yet, every act (and acts are all
only the growth of some feeling, some
thought), every act has its consequence ;
and, what is more, there is not an individual
who reads these lines, nor an individual on
earth, who has not, up to a given point, as I
have said, his destiny in his own hands; he

As soon as she caught sight of him, she
ran forward, the morning sunlight seeming
to glance and stream from her shoulders in
a cascade of molten topazes.
“She is a sweet child,” thought Cuthbert;
"but never will she be so beautiful as Emily
Whitsund, to whom I am engaged.”

you been? You naughty Mr. Cuthbert, I

Thanks to you for being so glad, but

“ Oh! I could tell you such a pretty story
about Must and Cannot ; they were two
kings, and they went to war! Miss Haxton
told me all about their great battle. But
say you will not go."
“ Ahem !” said Cuthbert, reddening and
shading his eyes for a moment; “ you are
very kind to wish me to stay—and I will
stay till evening, to please you. But which
of those two mighty kings of whom you
speak, won the battle ?- Must or Cannot ?"

“Oh! Must won in the end, but with
great loss; and then a very powerful king,
indeed, his neighbour, sent to offer him
friendship and alliance. That other king
was called Will. When he and Must are
friends, nothing can resist them ; but Will
often forgets this, and wastes half his king-
dom in wild and foolish undertakings, where
he gets taken prisoner.”
Cuthbert's gaze wandered, and when he
fixed it again on Henrietta, he was evidently
pursuing his own train of thought, and had
not paid servile attention to her prattling
explanations. She suddenly perceived his
abstraction, and a sort of angry blush or
glow incarnadined the oval symmetry of her
pallid cheeks. Cuthbert, in his turn, noticed
the altered expression of the beauteous
young fairy, who had suddenly ceased
speaking
“Something annoys you ?” said he.
“Yes ; you do."

being here?”
“ No.”
“ Then Geoffrey said, you know, that,

“ A thousand thanks ! Winnifrid will

Algernon is Algernon Childering. He

he goes away.”

said Cuthbert, smiling (but with far more of
the reality of the jealousy which his words
expressed, than he, in his pride, would have
acknowledged). “I have no chance of

Cuthbert, musingly.
“There !” cried the little fairy, with a
ringing laugh and a beaming countenance.
“The news is !—you see it is singular, your-
self !”
Yes,” said he, smiling sadly ; “ singular,
but not strange!”
There was something about his expression
which made the dear child pause suddenly
in her laughter. She put away, with a toss
of the head, the golden tresses which had
fallen over her forehead, and fixed a long,
inquisitive look upon Cuthbert.
Why,” she then asked, “ do you not
also go to Oxford, Mr. Cuthbert, and take
honour?”
The boy hesitated.
“Because -because—I-I must begin to
be busy in life ;—busy in life ; busy. “King

As he said this, young Harding heaved a
scarcely audible sigh. The child gazed at

innocent sympathy, echoing the sigh, mur-

While they were thus conferring, Harding
happened to look towards the window of
the drawing-room which commanded a view
of the garden, and he perceived at once the
fruits of fame, and the profound and con-
tinued sensation created by his all daring
and all achieving exploit of yesterday. Lady
Mandeville and a group of ladies were at
the window in the drawing-room. Lady
Mandeville was in the very act of pointing
with a book which she held in her hand
towards Cuthbert, and was evidently speak-
ing with animation ; while behind the fair
circle, and looking intently at him over
their shoulders, stood the elder Mr. Childer-

slant rays of the morning sun, and half
withdrawn into the blackness of the buttress-
sheltered and figure-guarded hollows. In
the house, under the porch of a wide folding
door, which opened opposite to the lofty arch
of the central passage, through the hedge
of roses, stood a stout man, without his hat,
his hands crossed, Napoleon-wise, behind his
back. Henrietta, running on before, shot by
this figure rather unceremoniously. Cuthbert,
however, approached him very differently,
and with far more observance, muttering :
There stands half a million of money!”
“Good morning, Mr. Bradworth,” said
Cuthbert, lifting his hat with a rather fine
air, but speaking in a tone at once cordial,
frank and respectful.

Mr. Bradworth's countenance brightened

so adroitly thrown in, “some person of dis-

very red hands into his trousers; then

twenty-five pounds), which he had received

While Geoffrey was displaying the won-

admiration of that case of razors, which he

from each new bauble to his friend's exultant
face, and then back again—taciturn, I say,

the finery provided for her approaching
bridal, could have been more absorbed,
abstracted, delighted, enraptured, than was

muttered to himself something which made

“I have not,” he mentally added, “a horse

While considering the animal, he silently
pursued this reflection a little further : “I
can ride, and I have nothing to ride. This
gentleman has the steed which would just
suit me, and he suits it not. Besides, what
will he do at Oxford? What might not I do?

mind or his manners, the wise books he has
written for the enlightenment of posterity,
the wise laws he has suggested in Parlia-
ment, the exploits he has performed, or any
services whatever rendered to the common
weal, or indeed rendered to others at all ?
Was it merit, or was it service, or was it
personal fascination, that was thus idolised ?
No—it was half a million of money.”
“A beautiful animal, indeed, Geoffrey !'
he suddenly said, rousing himself from his
abstraction ; " what did he cost ?”
“Don't know exactly, but I wouldn't
take a hundred pounds for him.”
After dinner, when the horses for the two
friends were announced to be at the door,
Henrietta ran across the room and offered
Cuthbert a magnificent bouquet of flowers.
Give these," said she, “to dear Winni-
frid, with my love. Has she a nice garden
of her own ?"

fall, and will soon fall very heavily.”
“Look !” exclaimed Henrietta, when
Cuthbert had followed with Geoffrey ; all
this part, from the fountain as far as that
statue, belongs to me! Papa says that I
am to call it mine! He says, also, that I
, I
am to be constantly looking after and
tending the flowers on fine days; he told
so immediately after the doctor had
gone away one morning; you remember,
Geoffrey, when I was so ill.”
“Ah !” said Cuthbert, looking anxiously,
and with a scrutinizing frown, at the child.
At this instant the weather suddenly
began to change ; a rack of misty clouds
concealed the moon; some drops of rain
fell, and a low plaintive-sounding wind
me
arose.
'In, in, Henrietta !” cried her brother,
seizing her hand, and making her run with

him towards the glass door, across the
gravel esplanade.
Efforts were made to induce Cuthbert
to “stay the night,” as the phrase is, since
the night promised to be so unpropitious.
He would not, however, be retarded, even
for five minutes, in his departure : merely
begging on his side that Geoffrey would not
think of accompanying him in such dis-
agreeable weather.
They were soon trotting smartly along the
plashy road, between the tall thick hedge-
rows, which, in certain counties, add so
much to the beauty of the rural scenery-
which helped, no doubt, of old, with other
features, to give its name of " merrie Eng-
lande” to this country—and which, in the
present day, excite to such a degree the
splenetic disapprobation of all economists,
as well as of all high farming agricul-
turists. A steep hill changed the pace;
and, when the friends came to its foot, they

walked their horses. This permitted con-
versation.
“Is your little sister, Henrietta,” asked
Cuthbert, “threatened with consumption ?
You seemed to be peculiarly on your guard
not to let her face the shower.”
Well, the doctor said, when he told her
to work among the flowers, and all that,
that it was much better she should not
catch another severe cough. She does not
now cough at all, and I think she is growing
up strong. Consumption never was in my
father's family. But mamma's mother died
of it, and they say it leaps a generation, and
so comes out again.”
Certainly you, Geoffrey, do not look a
likely subject for it!” said Cuthbert. "Leaps
a generation! How curious! Is that pos-
sible?”
“So I have heard,” returned Geoffrey:
“and, moreover, that such disorders are
far more transmissible by the mother's, than
by the father's side.”

strong, I tell
“ Ah !” said Cuthbert—"and it was your
mother's parent ?”
“ Yes—but dear Henrietta is growing up
you; and ever stronger may she
grow! To me her life makes a difference
of forty thousand pounds lost; and right
glad I am to think the dear little thing
is breathing out of good lungs, even at that
cost to me.'
“How is that?-forty thousand pounds !”
“Why it is settled on her, man! But
were she to die unmarried, it reverts to me,
merging back into the bulk of the estate.”
“Oh! I see,” said Cuthbert, smelling at
the large bouquet which he carried. "How
the dew brings out the scent of flowers !”
Geoffrey glanced round, and exclaimed-
"Hey! old fellow, that bouquet won't
reach its destination.
It is sent to your
sister Winnifrid, but I know one that will
get
it first."

Yet the plighted word may never come to
anything. Very often-
Here Cuthbert interrupted himself, and
glanced round uneasily. He fixed a long
stare on a dreary moor which bordered the
left of the road. Then he fell into a silent
fit of abstraction.
Geoffrey glanced in the same direction,
and seeing nothing to remark, reflected for
a moment, after which, shaking off some
thoughts too perplexing for solution, at
least by him, he exclaimed in a cordial
voice-
“Not come to anything ! Oh, yes, it
will, I am sure—all in good time. But
pardon me, dear Cuthbert, has the lady any
fortune?”
Hark, Geoffrey !” said Harding, laying
his hand nervously on his friend's bridle

horses' hoofs, and the soughing of the wind
in the trees.
“I heard a laugh, as if in scorn; at least,
so I fancied," muttered Cuthbert; and then,
without waiting for any comment upon this,
he added, rapidly : “any fortune ?
Emmy Whitsund has a piece of land in
Cumberland, which piece of land is hers
altogether, and fetches her the enormous
sum of ninety-five pounds per annum !”
“Well,” observed Geoffrey, good-naturedly
rather than profoundly, “never mind. Land
is land all the world over—and love is
love !"
“You speak like
•
an oracle," replied
Cuthbert, pulling his hat over his brows.
“Pray, do you know one Algernon Chil-
dering ?"
“I saw him once at the Park," said
Geoffrey.
“What is he like?" inquired Harding,
with a sort of vehemence.

“He is monstrous clever, I believe ; but
all I know is, that he is the nicest fellow
that ever was.”
“He has been a kind of playfellow of
your sister's, I think—has he not ?” pursued
Cuthbert, his voice trembling very slightly.
Here an incident occurred which pre-
vented Geoffrey's answer; and what Cuth-
bert or what Algernon might enact hereafter
—what destiny Henrietta, what Emily
Whitsund may yet encounter—these things,
I
say,
remain a little while in shadow.
Young Mandeville, whose mind was
running upon his outfit for Oxford, paid
at first no attention to the question, and
before he could collect his thoughts he
was startled by an exclamation of his
companion's.

How sinks his soul !
What black despair, what horror, fills his heart !”
THOMSON.
THEY had ascended the hill of which we
have spoken ; they had descended it. A
long, straight, and level road lay before
them. On the right, some tall woods, form-
ing the outskirts of Mandeville Park, and
diversified by copse, occupied the scene.
But, to the left, extended a damp and lonely
heath, on the bosom of which, about a
quarter of a mile from the road, shone,
white and glassy, a pool of sedgy water.
Cuthbert, during the latter part of the con-
versation detailed in our last chapter, had
repeatedly glanced, with an uneasy and

a
hypochondriac air, over this desolate pros-
pect. A misty moon, and a drizzling rain,
shed down a species of woe upon the scene.
Geoffrey, two or three times, looked round
impatiently at his friend, when he found that
a sentence was interrupted in the middle.
On each occasion, he observed Cuthbert
gazing with a wild, haggard, and even
alarmed look upon the dreary and cheer-
less wold. He would then shake himself in
the saddle, and with a manifest effort resume
the conversation. But, ever and anon,
the
gaze would wander, and always to the left
hand, always to the damp and lonely heath.
6. What the deuce is the matter with
him ?” thought Geoffrey, but he did not
put his thought into words. At last Cuth-
bert said
“Geoffrey, does not the sight of that
dismal plain, those gloomy swamps, with
the misty, glassy pools of glistening water,
strike a kind of awe into you?”

“Not a bit ; in four months there will be
capital wild duck shooting among those
flashes, as they call them in the west. That
is Heron Moss !”
“Flashes ! And see, Geoffrey, there are
some flashes of lightning! We shall be
caught in a storm. I don't like the heath.
I vote we gallop.”
And, without waiting for assent or answer,
he put his nag to its utmost pace, and never
pulled bridle till some corn fields and farm
yards glittered in the moonlight, on the left
of the road.
“How strange !” thought Geoffrey, as he
pursued his friend. Blunt and frank him-
self, he was not the person to leave such a
mystery uninvestigated.
“Why what, in the name of all that's
mad, possesses you, Cuthbert ?” cried he, out
of breath, when he had ridden up to his
friend.

!
“You were frightened! I dared not have
said so, and I know no more wonderful
thing. But here
you are, eh ?”
Yes,” said Cuthbert, with a look of
mortification which the darkness concealed
from his friend : “yonder is Lea Meadows.
It is very unlike Mandeville Park; it stands
c
close
upon the public road, as we Hardings
stand close upon the great common and
middle highway of life; we are not secluded
among the enveloping woods and proud
retirements of a lot at once aristocratic and
opulent. You must count upon homely fare
and an unpretending welcome, my dear
Geoffrey, under this lowly roof.”
There was a dignity beyond his years in
Cuthbert's manner of saying this, only its
effect was spoilt by a certain bitterness.
Geoffrey felt himself awkward in not know-

ing exactly what to reply. The moon here
shone out again, and Geoffrey looked up at
it puzzled. He had neither the half supple
and refining, half ardent and daring intelli-
gence of Cuthbert, nor his morbid and
irritable sensitiveness. He was an onward,
straightforward, right-hearted English youth,
not very bright in head, but bright in heart,
in honour, in courage, and in truthfulness.
Add to this, that he had the carelessness
sometimes seen in the heirs of high station
and of large estate. He had fallen into an
absurd but natural and very common error,
in which he was kept in countenance by the
number of his companions—he was "too
rich to be learned,” too high placed to
labour. To quote examples which would
put this error to shame would be pedantic,
because superfluous, although they are tempt-
ing in their picturesqueness, are these ex-
amples from Pericles to Cæsar, from Cæsar
to the modern and even contemporary heroes

of many an imperishable story. And if it
be foreign from my present task to deal with
this error by citing the thousand glorious
instances which disgrace and discountenance
it, much more is it remote from
my
business
to deal with it, by reasoning about it accord-
ing to the strict rules of logic and discussion.
One only example I will permit myself, that
which is contained in the occurrences I have
myself to relate.
But, short as are these digressive remarks,
the reader has already, I think, perceived
that they are too long for my taste. If with
equal propriety I could have done so, I should
have said at once, that Geoffrey was what
his friends would term “a fine, open-hearted,
simple fellow ”—and his honest enemies,
“an amiable and respectable young muff.”
His lot was happy, his future was secure,
his feelings were excellent, his ideas slow,
his expressions just as might be. If they
came when they were wanted, well and

our
good; if they did not, they still left him
six feet high, full of health, handsomeness,
and kindliness, as well as heir of Mandeville
Park, with its nine thousand a year.
Meanwhile, there are now before us two
ladies and two gentlemen, whose destinies,
amidst the casual throng, justify
curiosity, and claim our inquiries. Little
Henrietta is only in the bud, and belongs
to the future. Emmy Whitsund, as we
shall presently see, has blossomed into
more immediate interest. Which is to be
heroine of the doom? and which the
queen
of
prosperous love? But, besides
Cuthbert and our friend Geoffrey, there is
yet a third youth who may demand notice.
Cuthbert the reader begins to understand
and to watch ; but there is another, I repeat.
Who and what is this Algernon Childering ?
Can Geoffrey tell us
“ which lover and
which lady”? On these points there is
hitherto only one fact clear. That young

Harding is a suitor of one Emily Whitsund
—not yet introduced to the reader—and
that an engagement subsists between them,
is ascertained. But, without insisting on
an occasional distinction between “suitor'
and “ lover,” and without inquiring what
young Harding will ultimately prove most
inclined to love, or what tests his love will
be capable of resisting, I need scarcely say
that an exchange of plighted troth, made
so very early in life, has its peculiar risks.
The character of neither party is developed ;
and not on the character of either alone,
but on that of both one and the other, even
under favourable circumstances, depends the
sequel.
For the last five minutes of the journey
which I have described, Cuthbert had wholly
ceased to be himself. Geoffrey was pain-
fully conscious of a change of humour in
him, which I find it difficult to describe.

upon him, and clung, so to speak, around
his mind, there could not have been a
greater gloom of manner, or a more chilly
transition from the good spirits, if not
,
geniality, with which he had previously
supported his share in the conversation with
young Mandeville.
Entering now a little palisade through a
wicker gate, the two youths walked their
horses along a gravelled way, bordered by
a close mown miniature lawn, and leading
to the porch of an old-fashioned, red tiled
cottage. Through the central window of
three, all of which rose nearly from ground
to roof, in the nearest of the two cottage
wings, separated as these were by the broad
and far advancing porch, a continuous
arrowy light was shot over the flowers of
the little lawn, showing that the shutters of
that window were not quite closed, and that
the curtains were only partially drawn.
“How pretty,” said Geoffrey. “What a

nice place Lea Meadows is ! Hark !” he
added, reining in his horse.
“There's a
voice for you !”
Cuthbert, recalled agreeably from his ab-
straction by his friend's flattering criticism
and subsequent exclamation, halted also,
and listened. A woman's voice, youthful,
yet rich and mellow, penetrated the case-
ment, and bore to them a sweet, strange
air, the words of which were undistinguish-
able, but seemed to be foreign.
Young Harding had been delighted by
Geoffrey's praise of Lea Meadows, as it
appeared under the rallying beams of the
summer moon ; and, while he now listened
to the ravishing strain of music which stole
into the outer night, the dark mood seemed
to be soothed within him, and his counten-
ance cleared up, even like the sky above
them. A powerful wind which prevailed
in the upper regions of the atmosphere, but
was not felt where they stood, had already

rescued the middle heavens from troops of
clouds, which were chased and driven down
the apparent declivity of the gemmed and
luminous vault; while the moon, escaping
from the ragged rout, shed floods of pallid,
silvery light upon every object, casting
almost vertical shadows from the tall figures
of the two youths and of their horses, which
pawed their own eluding images upon the
darkened gravel, elsewhere gleaming with
a white, metallic-looking sheen. The tem-
porary disturbance of the weather had been
but a “heat shower," as it is termed, and
was passing away in distant rolls of thunder;
the air was warm and full of electricity, and
a few flashes of sheet lightning lit up
with
their lambent coruscations the skirts of the
receding storm. Presently, as the friends
still sate silent upon their horses, no other
sounds save the melody of the enchanting
song from the invisible vocalist broke the
stillness. The instrument on which she

sparingly accompanied the foreign words of
the sad, sweet air was evidently a guitar;
and it seemed as if the singer (so faintly
fell at times the delicate cadence) was not
in the room from which shot the arrowy
ray I have mentioned, but in some adjoin-
ing and more distant apartment. At length
the music seemed to soar into an appealing,
prolonged, and tremulous complaint, and
died away.
The friends still sate as if listening, but
the strain had quite ceased, and the only
sounds which they now heard were the
champing of their steeds upon the bit, and
the cry of the “corn-crake,” or land-rail,
amidst the newly-mown hay of a meadow,
which, from a little distance, sent its
peculiar and pleasant aroma even across the
dewy perfumes of the garden.
“It is Emily's voice,” said Cuthbert—"I

me. Pray excuse our scant retainership,

with the hair on, emerged from a coach-

Surely not. What should trouble us?”
asked Cuthbert.

just about the same time three o' the most
notorietyest housebreakers have broke out

nothing, and met nothing, as we came up
from Mandeville Park.”

fine young gentlemen, well mounted, they

pedlar, near Leamington, the night before

“Is it possible,” said Geoffrey.
“Ah!” rejoined Humphrey, “and they
left the poor chap as naked as the day he
was born-ah! did they. You know the
spot, Master Cuthbert: the narrow lane
between the banks, a short cut from the
carriage road out o' Leamington to the
Throstledale railway station.”
“Surely,” said Cuthbert, “I know the
spot well. The station is about three-quar-
ters of a mile from the town of Throstle-
dale, and the carriage-road winds round
the foot of the hill, whereas the lane you
speak of crosses its back. There's a thick
hazlewood on each hand, above the high
banks.”

“I am content as we are," observed that
sensible personage, with gravity.
You're about right, sir, I'm thinking,'
said old Humphrey, nodding his head sig-
nificantly. “Belike, you'll not have heard
what happened last week, Master Cuthbert,
to the chaplain of the gaol, Parson Trust-
emall ?”
“No-what?"
Humphrey chuckled, for a few moments,
with such inward gratification, that he bent
double between the horses' heads, and was
seized with a fit of coughing before he could
reply.
Why, the chaplain is the prime friend o’
these ticket folk; he's always the first to
give 'em a character, and you'd say they
war a hinnocent aud hinjured race o' people,
to hear him. They went astray—why?
Cause no one trusted o' them. There was

no bowels in the land. Only you take care
o' the bowels, and the throats would take
care of themselves. Show yourself sweet
like to the critters, and they'd come round

dam. Don't be always a growlin' at 'em.

turned out ill, and took to 'ighway robbery.
They got round the chaplain, who was
lately removed back to his own county (he
does the Stafford gaol now), and he wrote
very strong about Ben. Well, he was a

me a couple of sovereigns--quick !' ' I

chaplain. “Hold your jaw,' says Ben, and

or I'll smash your skull, and then wot

And old Humphrey resumed his chuckle,
with most reprehensible glee and malice.
“ But how is all this known ?" asked
Cuthbert.

“Only think,” said Cuthbert, “ of the
man telling such a story against himself !
Well, Humphrey, good-night; we'll go in
now. All are well, I hope ?”
“ All are well, Master Cuthbert-and
your sister, Miss Winny, is as active as a

in.”
“ I'm glad to hear it,” said young Hard-

horses to their stable.

distinct image before his mind's eye. That
young gentleman's psychological develop-
ment, I shall continue to leave to the
incidents of my narrative; these will best
finish that “picture of an interior” which
I thought they could also best commence.

only, therefore, to add that he looked rather
older than he was. You would say that
he was probably about two-and-twenty.
Some persons seem older than they are
in their youth, and younger in after life;
presenting alike, at the age of twenty, for
instance, and at that of forty, the air and
impression of thirty. Others look old very
early, once and for all ; and others again,
much fewer and rarer temperaments, seem
to be endowed, both in mind and person,

with the attributes of almost immortal
youth. It is a very common idea, that
the children of aged parents generally wear
that aspect of precocious senility to which
I have alluded; but the rule is unsatis-
factory. In reality, the circumstances, the
health, and the mental cheerfulness or
melancholy, of the parents have much more
connection with this result. A wizened and
puny offspring is seen to issue as often
from premature, as from somewhat retarded,
marriage ; while the corporal and intel-
lectual vigour evinced by the cadet of the
family frequently forms a contrast to the
debility of the first-born.
Cuthbert Harding's looks belonged cer-
tainly to a stage of life a little in advance
of that which he had attained; and one
cannot ascribe the circumstance to the opera-
tion of the assumed natural law laid down
in that popular philosophy, which popular
experience contradicts, and to which I have

adverted; for his little sister Winnifrid,
born ten years later, and, therefore, of
parents older by that much, exhibited the
very opposite characteristic—seeming much
more infantine than she was.
She and Cuthbert's parents met the two
friends in the outer room.
When the fond welcomes and embraces
which young Harding received from his
father and mother were over, and when
Geoffrey had been introduced, and had ex-
changed a hearty shake of the hand with
each of the good couple, Mrs. Harding said
to her son, in a rather nervous manner, and
in a low voice, “ Your Uncle Marlowe is
here!”

the knuckles of his left hand with his right,

left, as he rubbed them together.

account, but which really expressed some

composedly. “Emily
Whitsund, too, is here," he added, in a
quicker way.
· Yes, dear," returned Mrs. Harding ; “but
your uncle, who is going to sleep at Lea
Meadows to-night, is to take back his ward
to-morrow after breakfast.'
He was only now saying,” subjoined
Mr. Harding, in a voice scarcely above his
breath, and again cracking the knuckles—it
was a trick he had when uneasy—“that he
wanted to have a serious conversation with
you at the earliest opportunity; and that,
if
you
did not come to-night, you were to
ride over to the Glebe at Panes cum

But now I suppose he will talk to you to-
morrow morning, before he takes Emily
back."
“I am at his service,” replied Cuthbert,
“either to-night or to-morrow.”
When this whispering was over, a little
sprightly form bounced into “brother Cuth's"
arms, and called on him to remember that
he had a sister.
“Ah! Winny,” he cried, kissing her-
“ we've overlooked you too long. Why,
you're grown wonderfully, dear! Your
recent illness seems to have improved you.
You are not so stumpy as you were !”

she brought out in fine style the aspirated
diphthong (“th ”).
" True ! so you can, love ; and it used to
be Cut when I was here last. Hang it ! I've
forgotten her bouquet in the stables,” added
he to himself.
“Ain't I improved ?" she demanded.

Well, am I not improved ?”
Come, don't tease your brother, Winny;
there's a good girl,” said the father.
“ She doesn't tease me. There's room for
improvement still, Winny.”
“Oh, I know that !” she answered, very
gravely, placing the forefinger of her right
hand on her lips. Then, suddenly dismiss-
ing her air of meditative acknowledgment,
she bounded into the alcove, exclaiming
loudly, for the information of those within
and of all concerned—“Here's Brother

Cuth, from Eton !”
Young Harding, following his mother, and
followed by Geoffrey and the old man,
entered the same apartment, where he shook
hands with an elderly gentleman and a
young lady, with whose hand his became
unaccountably entangled for a few seconds;
and then he presented them to Geoffrey-

able form—thus : “My friend, Mr. Geoffrey

Marlowe Harding. Mr. Geoffrey Mande-

The lady silently bent her neck : the
clergyman rose and bowed, with marked
cordiality.
“I shall be glad,” he observed, “to see
Mr. Geoffrey Mandeville any time when his
rides or drives may bring him into the
neighbourhood of my poor parsonage. I
have the honour of a slight acquaintance
with Sir Walter.”
I am very much obliged,” returned
Geoffrey, "for your kind invitation. Where-

not very strong in Latin, as Cuthbert knows;
but that seems to me to mean, the loaves
and the fishes along with them.' You seem
well and snugly bestowed, Dr. Marlowe ?”
“Your Latin does not fail you ; the name
is exceedingly scandalous, I admit. There
is a historical memory attached to it, which
I will tell you when you come to see me.
It has stuck to the place ever since the
utterance of a profane joke of Charles the
Second's, when his amiable, but not respect-
able, Majesty was bestowing the living on
an unworthy predecessor of mine."
By this time all the group were seated in
the verandah, and Mrs. Harding, addressing
young Mandeville, said—“So you and Cuth-
bert have left Eton together, and in your
friendship and kindness you have thought
proper to come between our boy and his old
parents ? for you took him with you to

“Mrs. Harding, pardon me; it so happens
that I did not take Cuthbert with me to
Mandeville Park. He was there before me.'
“How there before you ?” exclaimed the
two old people in a breath, while a move-
ment of general surprise occurred in the
circle.
“Your son has saved Lady Mandeville's
life, by his noble courage and his astonishing
readiness of
presence of mind,"
pursued Geoffrey.
All eyes were raised and fixed for a
moment on Cuthbert, after which they
were turned upon Geoffrey. Cuthbert stole
a glance towards Miss Whitsund, whose
glance, also, had crept towards Cuthbert,

everybody else, upon him who had made so

unintelligible an announcement.

“For Heaven's sake, Mr. Mandeville,
what has my dear boy done?” cried Mrs.
Harding ; “ do not keep me in suspense.
“I love him as a brother,” resumed
Geoffrey, with unwonted eloquence, “and I
admire him as a hero; and no one in
Mandeville Park, or in my family, can ever
forget his conduct. Henceforth, we are all
bound to him as our signal benefactor, and
devoted to him as to our best friend. For
my part, I am only too glad to have the
opportunity of saying before his family a
part of what I feel, and of what I wouldn't
and couldn't say to Cuthbert alone and
privately ; it would be so deucedly disagree-
able to be told by him that I was using
flattery, or that he would like me to drop
the subject, or some other of those confound-
edly acid remarks, at which he is only too
ready."
Probably, Geoffrey had never before in
his life uttered so many consecutive words.

His eloquent vehemence, as well as the
astounding purport of the statement which
he made, took the whole company whom he
addressed by surprise. Their looks rapidly
alternated between him and Cuthbert, who
bent his eyes on the ground, and turned-
not red—but very pale. The Rev. Marlowe
Harding, D.D., frowned thoughtfully, like a
man whose calculations have been some-
what put out, somewhat dislocated—and
who suspects that it will be necessary to go
over them again. He, like the others, main-
tained observant silence; but Mrs.
Harding, who had been knitting a summer
curtain, before the two friends arrived, and
who was about to resume her occupation,
dropped her piece of work with the needles,
and, resting her hands on her knees, gazed
for an instant, with lips apart, at Geoffrey.
“I am on the rack," said she; “do tell
us everything My dear Mr. Mandeville,

what you have stated. Why do you speak
so of my boy?”
“Why? Why do I speak so of Cuth-
bert?” returned Geoffrey, solemnly. “Be-
cause, Mrs. Harding, only for your son, not
only my mother, Lady Mandeville, would
probably at this moment be among the dead,
but because I had, apparently, just the same
chances as Cuthbert had of saving her, and
yet I neither knew what ought to be done,
nor could I have done it if I had known ;
and because, above all, Cuthbert did not
save my mother's life without the imminent
hazard of his own.”
Geoffrey then briefly, and with great feel-
ing, related the occurrences
as we have
already detailed them; utterly falsifying his
little sister Henrietta's depreciatory criticism
upon
his
powers of narration, and exempli-
fying the wiser and juster remark of a truly
great ancient thinker, who tells us that “it

At Mandeville Park, Geoffrey, in a flurry
and frenzy of delight, after an hour of the
most cruel suspense, was talking to those
from whom he had as much to learn about
the transaction as he could himself impart,
and he had certainly then expressed his
thankfulness in very incoherent and uncouth
language. Indeed, he hardly knew what he
was saying or doing, in his excitement,
anxiety, and exultation. But on the present
occasion, full of calm gratitude and of
generous admiration, having to describe his
friend's exploit to an audience totally igno-
rant of it, and at the same time naturally
feeling more interest in Cuthbert than any
other person on earth could be expected to
entertain—thus made, I say, the historian of
the event—Geoffrey told it with the most
graphic and even pathetic effect. Not once
did the famous expression, "stunning, sir,
stunning,” escape him ; and Cuthbert, who

remembered Henrietta's mimicry, in vain
listened for the “hundred thousand bricks.”
As Geoffrey concluded, Mrs. Harding wept
for joy and pride—a tear glistened even in

pair of little arms' were flung rapturously
round Cuthbert's neck, while Winnifrid
kissed him boisterously again and again,
much increasing his not unpleasurable con-
fusion by her repeated cries of “Well done,
Cuth !”
The Rev. John Marlowe Harding, D.D.,
during this little scene, had been buried in
a profound meditation ; his striking and
somewhat austere features exhibiting a
family likeness to those of Cuthbert, espe-
cially in that firm and compressed mouth,
the lines of which were so faintly, yet so
decisively traced in the younger man, but
deepened and made harsh by time in the
elder. He had come to Lea Meadows, as

both Mrs. and Mr. Harding had mysteriously
intimated to their son, not perhaps solely in
order to have, but yet intending to have,
some serious conversation" with the
young
gentleman who formed the subject of Geof-
frey's enraptured praises. Uncle Marlowe's
“ serious conversations” were evidently es-
teemed by the good couple to be conversa-
tions of a kind for which it was as well that
Uncle Marlowe's nephew should be prepared
by a friendly warning beforehand. During
the thoughtful pause which I have men-
tioned, Doctor Marlowe Harding cast two
or three “under glances ” from beneath his
beetling brows, at the youth with whom he
was to
converse.”
Well,” remarked the clergyman, at
length, that is one way of coming from
Eton with credit and distinction. It is, at
least, a comfort that my nephew is full of
spirit and resources, and that he has had the
good fortune to exercise them so early in so
good a cause."

Geoffrey noticed that Mrs. Harding winced,
while Cuthbert himself betrayed no emotion.
Nobody replied to this observation ; and
it seemed to be felt that, at least in Cuth-
bert's presence, the topic was now exhausted.
Hitherto, young Harding's first evening at
home had been signalized by incidents a
little confusing, perhaps, but highly flatter-
ing and favourable ; but the sequel of that
first evening was destined to ruffle his feel-
ings in a curious degree. He was chatting
absently with his mother and with little
Winnifrid, and was meditating by what means
he could possess himself of the chair next to
Emily Whitsund, a chair at that moment
occupied by his formidable and reverend
uncle, when suddenly his daring project
was arrested, and a remarkable conversation,
leading to various ulterior events, arose out
of the following simple request-
“May I entreat of you, Miss Whitsund,
to favour us with a repetition of that en-

This speech was addressed by young
Mandeville to the lady whom he named, as
she, Cuthbert, Geoffrey, and Cuthbert's
father, mother, and little sister, having
now adjourned all more special themes by
tacit and common consent, sate together
under Uncle Marlowe's austere regards in
the verandah and grapery which I have
mentioned, and which opened upon the
flower grounds at the side of the cottage.
The large room with the three windows,
before which Harding and his friend had
stopped to listen to the song in question,
communicated by folding doors with an
inner and smaller apartment, terminating
in this verandah. Here the family of the
Hardings and their four guests were now
assembled to pass the time preceding that
supper, on which Mrs. Harding had insisted

companion, whom she termed “ travellers,”

the appetite of that interesting and hungry
class.
It will be well, before going further, to
present to the reader more fully those about
whom he knows the least. He ought to
make acquaintance with Cuthbert's family.
Little Winnifrid Harding was a child of
about nine years old, with a face otherwise
very pretty, but disfigured by a nose which
exhibited a depression where there should
have been either a slight elevation or a
level continuance, according to all the laws
of human and artistic beauty. This depres-
sion had formerly, however, been much
deeper; it was gradually diminishing, and
it promised to disappear altogether as the

Cuth,” and a love for haymaking in
summer, and snowballs in winter. She was
a sprightly, quick-witted, observant little
girl, whom it was impossible to keep out
of the fruit garden after the cherries had
ripened, and who was in high alliance with
old Humphrey, who not only managed the
stable department, but took care of the
garden. She was sharp at her lessons; and,
on the whole, neither with respect to her
health, nor with respect to her disposition,
did she give any serious uneasiness to her
parents. She had, only the other day, pro-
posed to her mother, who was a notable
housewife, to begin to help her in house-
keeping or, at least, to begin to learn ; and,
when Mrs. Harding had replied, “Well,
Winny, and where shall we begin ?” the
little darling had rejoined, without a mo-
ment's hesitation, “ with the jams and pre-
serves, mamma!”
She was a prodigious favourite with her

father, whose surreptitious and clandestine
pipe she had learned to light on apparently
the most hopeless occasions ; for Mrs. Hard-
ing (who would not, for the world, have
seen her “good man " deprived of his peace-
ful cigar) retained from earlier years a sort
of pretence and affectation of opposition to
the robuster, fuller-flavoured, and longer-
burning meerschaum. The father, in return,
spoilt his little “snubby," as he called the
good-humoured child, in whose face, never-
theless, he was delighted to mark the de-
creasing evidences of the snub, and the
grow-
ing dawn of eminent attractions. Whenever
Mrs. Harding displayed discontent with
Winny's ill-remembered or ill-said lesson,
and when Winny's cheerful countenance was
clouded with the grief and bathed in the
tears which quickly came under her mother's
reproof, the father would seize an early
opportunity of indemnifying his afflicted pet
with conserves and sweetmeats, which the

morals and to her teeth.
“Grin, Winny!” the doting father would
then exclaim—“Grin, and show your teeth!
Where did you ever see such a set, Mrs.
Harding, except in your looking-glass !
You'll have your mother's teeth, Winny-
that's certain. And as to morals, go and
kiss mamma, my love, and give her another
kiss from her old husband, and then come
and light your father's pipe. Always re-
spect your parents, dear, and do as your
mother bids you. That's a lesson for you ;

and now pay more attention to your books
next time. Remember, it is your mother

displease mamma. A little more tobacco,

One little occurrence had confirmed the

father's infatuated predilection for Winny.
Mr. Harding, who well understood the
nature of his wife's innocent affectation
about his pipe, and that, provided she
should be still permitted to protest undis-
turbed, he would assuredly be allowed after-
wards to smoke unwatched, felt, nevertheless,
that it would be more agreeable if he fur-
nished her with a reasonable pretext for
tolerating, under strictly understood and
limited conditions, the obnoxious indulgence.
Accordingly he affirmed to her, with great
show of heat, on the authority of all scien-
tific horticulturists, that the oleaginous ex-
udations of the meerschaum rendered the
fumes of tobacco still more beneficial (bene-
ficial they were conceded to be, even from
a cigar) to the vine, because those fumes
killed the insects which otherwise would
prey upon the life of the growing tendrils.
In the vinetum, then, or grapery, or veran-
dah, the prohibition was removed, and the

pipe passed free. That place was privileged,
and, during summer, all went well. But
when the cold weather came, Mr. Harding
could not be beguiled even by the charms
of his richly-seasoned bowl of marine froth
to venture into that outpost.
The pipe,
therefore, lay idle on a table, and poor
Mr. Harding's wistful glance stole towards
it frequently as he sat by the fire. Little
Winny, who had heard the previous discus-
sion respecting the “beneficial” effects of
tobacco smoke upon the vine, looked an
image of mental distress and childish sym-
pathy as she watched her father. At last
she could stand it no longer, and she ex-
claimed-
“Mamma, I'm sure papa's pipe would be

“So the way to do good to the insects,
Winny, is to kill them ? ” said the mother,
smiling
“Ah! you know what I meant, mamma, "
said Winny;
“if papa don't kill the insects
with his pipe, they'll kill the grapes before
they're ripe.”
“There's reasoning for you !” cried the
enraptured father. “Those are what I call
deductions ! That is thinking power !
Winny, dear, where is that large-bowled
pipe that your mother said was so prettily
veined, and streaked, and coloured, and
shaded, and clouded-only for the use it
was intended for. Ahem, I don't want to
use it, you know, Laura, my love,” added
Mr. Harding, in a mild and cheerful voice,

assumption of sincerity and of lively resigna-
tion, which would have done credit to a

profession, the adepts of which may be
called the barristers and retained counsel

Winny, who wished nothing better, had
quickly found and triumphantly produced
the large pipe; when Mr. Harding, holding
it before him for a moment with a pensive
expression of admiration, extended it towards
his wife, saying
“ Just look at that colouring, those deda-
lous tints, Mrs. Harding.”
She, on the other hand, gently pushing
away the wonder of a pipe, the matchless
sample of slowly impregnated and whimsical
encaustic, the patient production of many
a sitting, declined all examination, and said,
drily and inexorably-

“ Landscapes are best not clouded over,
in the way in which I know you want to
treat this precious ‘landscape of yours, since

“I assure you, Laura, in the present

of the rosy-threaded, many-coloured, cross-
hued marble of the finest quarries of Italy,
that could be compared with that bit of
shading. I'm perfectly serious ; it is quite

foam.”

“How delicately you phrase it, William !
No; not merely a design of that sort, but
that particular and specific very design.

“In that case, on second thoughts, I don't

in which operation the fond father each time
notes with admiration the progressively in-
creased cunning of her hand.

tumultuous emotions of a kind previously
unknown to that unambitious and unre-
marked retreat, the reader will pardon these
characteristic little details, exhibiting “still
life” at Lea Meadows. The place became
well known enough at a later epoch, sepa-
rated by but a very short interval from that
of Cuthbert's final return home; and if
nothing were now said to give an idea of
the inmates and of their manner of existence
-as they had been up to this time—no good
opportunity for such a picture could hence-
forth occur.
It will not be without interest
to despatch this subject at once ; and, for
that reason, an anecdote, in which Cuthbert
also figures, may be added.
From what has been said, it is clear how
great a pet Winny was with her old father ;
perhaps, in reality, she was not less a
favourite of her wiser mother's, although
the affection displayed itself in a different

popular with all at Lea · Meadows, down to
old Humphrey, a pluralist, whom I have
already mentioned as undertaking in that
modest establishment the care of the stables
and that of the garden simultaneously.
The portion of the garden which contained
the fruit was at the end of the parterres
of flower beds, which the verandah—where,
at this moment, sat the family of Lea
Meadows and their visitors-overlooked.
Now, the fruit garden in question was en-
closed by a high wall, capable, it was
vainly hoped, of excluding little Winny
from predatory inroads, which might prove
pernicious to her health. She well knew
where the cherries and other fruits were ;
and, although she could not have climbed
the wall proper of the enclosure, her in-
genuity and daring made another wall,
which joined it at right angles, on the
side near the stables, serve her purpose.
This second wall was much lower than that

of the garden at about thirty yards from
the latter, to the level of which it gradu-
ally rose ; and Winnifrid, getting upon the
copestone, pretty much in the attitude in
which ladies sit on horseback, edged her-
self sideways till she reached the loftier
rampart, on the top of which she could
now lay her hand. The ascent afterwards
from her stone side-saddle was easy. It
was the descent on the farther or fruity
side of this obstruction that was formidable.
But, by creeping along its coping some
ten or twelve yards, Winny placed herself
exactly above the strawberry beds, the rich
mould of which promised a soft landing
to a bold jumper. When first the child
adventured this enterprising expedition, she
found in the garden, and at his work, old

He was right. It was duly locked, as he
had supposed, and the key was on the
inside. Had Winnifrid dropped from a
balloon ? or had the knowing and almost
uncanny-looking child—had this little witch
been disembarked in his sacredly guarded
and high-walled enclosure from the “cloudy
car” of her friend, some sky-riding and far-
wandering magician? That such person-
ages were rare he knew, but that they
existed he secretly believed in his heart.
He had read of them in a very old and
dog-leaved copy of the “ Arabian Nights,"
given to him by Master Cuthbert on his
first departure for Eton. It was, therefore,
with a confused misgiving that he asked
Winny how she had got into the garden ;
but she begged him to promise he would
not tell she had been there; and when,
at last, he yielded that pledge to her
vehement importunities and her wheedling

turn, vouchsafe to him about her means

“Did you fall from the clouds, Miss

Winny ?” he demanded.
She only laughed, but so impish was
the light which darted from her sidelong
glancing eye, so startling was the fifelike,
shrilly, mocking, roguish, outburst of her
mirth, so firmly, and yet so slightly and
so lightly, set upon the ground was the
agile form-upright as a dart, well poised,
elastic—seeming, indeed, as if just alighted
from the air, and on the very spring to
reascend, that old Humphrey, who was ex-
cessively superstitious, gazed upon the keen-
witted, mercurial, restless, omnipresent dar-
ling of Lea Meadows, with feelings in which
a latent awe, which he would not have
acknowledged even to himself, was blended
with the protecting love and respectful
admiration of an old retainer of the family
for its youngest born.

I may mention that Winny, who was
small for her years, and who looked, as I
stated a little while since, younger than she
was, had taken the astonishing precaution to
efface the deep footprints which her valiant
plunging leap had made in the strawberry
bed. She had, with her hands, scraped
together the loose, soft mould into the holes,
and had restored it completely to its pre-
vious appearance. There, then, stood she
,
before old Humphrey, the bloom and flush
of violent exercise on her wee wee cheeks,
exceedingly dirty in face and hands, her
bonnet tossed, her hair disordered, her little
apron filled with fruit, and the falling ends
gathered up and fastened to the string which
attached it round her waist, so as to form
of the apron an extemporaneous bag, while
a beautiful new cambric pocket handkerchief
was swinging from her left hand in the
shape of another and smaller bag, apparently
well filled, and as ill-treated by the daring

and freakish damsel as though it had been
rag of sacking. She had left no
traces of her escalade and descent into that
forbidden land; and wonderful was the con-
trast between her reckless disregard of per-
sonal tidiness, and the minute exactitude
and scrupulous carefulness of her precau-
tions to carry out any specific action or
scheme on which she was for the moment
bent. That contrast between her heedful
moods and her heedless habits indicated the
class of character to which she belonged.
All parents who have, and all who may yet

of the unobtrusive, but all-deciding, inci-
dents and signs of early childhood.
Never was there a greater error, let it be
said in passing, than to imagine infancy
unfraught with the strong tendencies which
determine the whole fate of the individual
;
never a greater mistake than to wait for
character to develop itself. The truth is,
that childhood is the very reign of character,
and that idiosyncracy cannot be watched too
early. In childhood, the individual triumphs
over circumstances; but in after life (unless
advantage, to impress on it a given direction,
has been taken of the gigantic power which
the will then, and then only, exercises),
circumstances triumph, on the contrary, over
the individual. None of us have been really
so much our true selves as in early life; we
are subsequently anything, or everything,
which we have been then induced to prepare
ourselves to become.
But to return. Humphrey vowed discre-

before him, that he would not relate the
apparition which he had seen.
One evening, however, Winny, as ill luck
ordained, made her customary irruption into
the garden after Humphrey had left it for
the day, and had locked the door behind
him. Winny helped herself, blackened her
hands, blackened her face, blackened her
sleeves, tore her frock, and then looked round
for Humphrey. Not visible. He must be in
the little garden-house—which, inside, was
hung all over with rows of onions and of
dried seeds, and which smelt so sweetly, and
lurked so darkly, retiring half embowered
under the deciduous canopy of the weeping
ash, in the farthest corner of the garden, at
the end of the terrible, shadowy, whispering,
shuddering, ghostlike avenue of yew trees.
When we return, full grown, to places which
we quitted as children, we are astonished by
the apparent diminution and dwarfing of

what we had supposed large. This small
avenue seemed to Winny to be immense. It
was growing dusk where she stood, but,
beneath the over-arching shade of that fear-
ful approach, it was already quite dark—it
was black. There was no way, however, by
which Winny could get out of the garden
except through the open door. She could
get down into it easily enough ; but to
emerge, this was the task, this the difficulty.
From the top of the lofty wall the child
could boldly throw herself into the soft
strawberry-bed; and then she could cun-
ningly obliterate the traces of her jump.
But she could not throw herself up again
from the strawberry bed to the top of the
wall.
Winny had some little fraction of the
all-daring, all-confronting courage of her
brother, yet it was not without a shake and
shiver of her whole frame, not without a
nervous groan and a chill of vague fear, that

she hazarded herself in the dark avenue con-
ducting to the garden hut. Once within
the jaws of its shadows, she ran as if fiends
and goblins were in pursuit of her. Half-
way she stopped, screamed, and looked
,
round. No; there was nothing! She per-
ceived that a cold hand had not been laid
upon her shoulders; hideous fingers, re-
sembling claws, had not clutched her poor
little throat. She resumed her advance,
venturing—just attempting—a slight song,
but her voice quavered too much ; she re-
signed the effort, and ran till she reached
the hut door. Lifting the latch, she pushed
it open, and tremulously said-
“ Dear Humphrey !—dear old Humphrey!

No answer ; and if the yew tree avenue
was dark, the hut was darkness itself.
Looking back, she discerned the distant

she never stopped to gather up the lost

that it was not from gluttony that Winny

because forbidden they were ; partly because
they were acquired with such adventure;

and a boundless giver. Certain small ragged
children had discovered her mysterious opu-
lence; they were in the habit of throwing
themselves in her way once or twice a week;
and they were enriched by her munificence.
Winny's great delight was to watch and
study the countenances of these clandestine
correspondents, as she poured her treasures
into outstretched greasy caps, and the lifted
fronts of dingy, threadbare, tattered little
frocks.
But I have left the child imprisoned in
the garden.
When her supper hour arrived she was, of
,
course, sought high and low; and, to the
serious alarm of her parents, could nowhere
be found. Soon the strange news of Miss
Winnifrid's disappearance penetrated to the
stables, where Humphrey was making the
bed of the aged, experienced, and soberly-
conducted horse which Mr. Harding kept for
his gig. Immediately the thought flashed

through Humphrey's mind that the child
could be only in the garden, and that she
could not get out of it on account of his
absence. Exclaiming that he would soon
find her, he was followed by Mr. and Mrs.
Harding and by Cuthbert (for this occurred
during Cuthbert's last visit home from Eton)
to the door of the high-walled fruit garden.
No sooner had he opened this door than the
child rushed forth, like some scared and
hunted animal, but was caught in her
father's arms.
Cuthbert stood by—atten-
tive, observant, absorbed. “Humphrey !”
cried the elder Mr. Harding, “ how is this?
You know that we never allow Miss Winny
to go, except with ourselves, into this place.
You must have left the door open some time
this evening, and she must have stole in.

servant, “such a thing never happened me,

Winny don't want doors to get in !”
“You must have admitted her yourself ?”
May I be blowed if I ever did," said
Humphrey with privileged ardour ; "I know
my duties better. There's nothing worse for
little uns than too much wall fruit, except
it was the bite of a glandered horse.”
During this cross-examination, Winny
awaited her own turn, a very dirty fore-
finger in her mouth, and a desperate resolve
in her heart. She would divulge nothing
about the secret method of escalade and
storm. The darkness of evening concealed
in a great measure the extremely damaged,
battered, clay-covered, and
even blood-
stained, appearance of the young sorceress.
" Then you never have let her into the
garden, Humphrey ?”
“Never, sir ; though I'm free to confess,
I've sometimes let her out of it.”
“That passes my comprehension,” said

“How did you get in,
Winny ?”
Winny uttered what was half a sob and
half a giggle, nor would she yield any other
answer to the repeated question, although
urged strongly by both her parents. Her
mother said that she should be locked up
till she gave the required information. But
it came at once without her confession.
Cuthbert had been scrutinizing the so
thought impregnable defences of the garden
with a sort of military eye, and with a
profound insight into his wayward sister's
character ; and, noting the fragment of
lower wall which abutted upon the other-
wise more secure enclosure, he at once solved
the mystery, and pointed out the secret to
Mr. and Mrs. Harding.
“Is that the way you got in?” says the
father, with a look of pretended indignation,
but in reality suppressing, with great exer-
tion, a violent temptation to laugh.

housemaid, Margy.
“ Miss Winnifrid has ordered some warm

The articles in question quickly came, and
Cuthbert shortly afterwards had the pleasure
of marching Winny into the room where
her father and mother were awaiting the
uncertain moment of repentance. She now
replied to every question frankly.
I need not dwell upon the singular and
precocious art of every word that Cuthbert
had addressed to his resentful sister. He
had undertaken to bring her to terms within
half an hour: the mother sighed, and old
Harding shook his head to signify that, in
this case, Cuthbert overrated the extent of

his eloquence and tact; ere five minutes

to what was best, but, in part to what was
worst, in Winny's character—to her affection
and sense of justice chiefly—but also to her
pride, a worsted, but still resisting and
desperate, enemy, for whose easy retreat he
had made a bridge, not “of gold,” but of
the broken wall near the stables.
While others, whom I must leave it to
my tale to pourtray, wait to give me a sit-
ting, I have been too long detained by this
child, of whom I will, therefore, add merely
that her popularity extended to the kitchen,
and that the cook never made any pastry
for the table of the seniors without slily
putting aside a small perquisitional and pre-
scriptive patty, cake, or pie, which was
known, and sacred, as “Miss Winny's tax.”

That young lady, whose character was

Mandeville's history of the transaction in

At quite the other end of the glazed and

absent-minded replies to his sister's OC-
casional whispers.

Miss Whitsund was the daughter of a
lieutenant-colonel of the line, who had fallen
on the field of battle in the East. Her
mother had died while the little Emily was
still in long clothes.
That mother was
sister to the Reverend Dr. Marlowe Hard-
ing's wife; and, as the colonel was con-
demned by his profession to frequent and
prolonged terms of exile, in which it did not
suit his views to take his child with him, he
had made an arrangement by which the
infant found, even during part of his life-
time, a home with her aunt, Mrs. Marlowe
Harding, to whom, therefore, she came, in
her vacations, from that convent in France
where it was her father's wish that she
should receive her education. Upon the
colonel's death in battle, it was found, by.
his will, that the Reverend Dr. Harding had
been constituted guardian of the orphan,
and the prayer and behest of that solemn
document required him, in all respects, to

assume, until her marriage, the control and
management of the little estate which the
colonel had left to his daughter.
This arrangement had naturally brought
young Cuthbert Harding into acquaintance
with his uncle's fair ward, at a very early
age. Indeed, Cuthbert's childhood and
Emily's childhood had played together.
Hence arose, later, the opportunities for
that premature engagement which Cuthbert
had succeeded in extorting or surprising.
The audacity of the youthful lover had
wooed the inexperience of the beautiful
orphan. It must not be inferred, however,
that the Hardings of Lea Meadows and those
of the Rectory, known by the auspicious
name of Panes cum Piscibus, moved in the
same sphere of society. The two brothers
visited each other indeed, but not each
other's friends. The clergyman still held up
his head in the circles where his forefathers
had immemorially been at home; but the

brewer had sunk out of their ken and
recognition into quite another grade. As a
child, Cuthbert could not feel or discern this
disparity of social station ; but, latterly, his
observant mind had become fully aware of
it, and his spirit ruffled its rebellious plumage
within him-
" And shook
The strength of its unconquerable wings.”
At the same time he found the situation
anything but simple. It revolted him to
note the air of superiority, and the dictatorial
protection, which his uncle, the doctor, dared
to assume towards his father, the brewer.
But, on the other hand, it was the uncle
who had so generously sent him to Eton,
and who had paid for his schooling; it was
the uncle who had more than once called on
him there; it was his uncle who had always
'tipped” him; and it was his uncle who
had pronounced, with direct reference to
him (Cuthbert), the words which — boy

though he was when he first heard them-
had so often thrilled in his memory, and
made him feel an inch taller with the pride
of conscious responsibility, and of trust re-
posed—I mean the words: “There shall at
least be one gentleman in the family.” He
was to be that gentleman-he, Cuthbert !
Add to this that he was not ashamed of his
uncle, who had some reputation as a scholar,
and who occupied besides, as I have hinted,
the old position of the family in the county,
a position which his father, the head of that
family, had abdicated. On the other hand,
Cuthbert, in self defence, as it were, could
not forget whose son he himself was; and,
in this smouldering and chronic dissension
between the two brothers, his calculations
were held in suspense by opposing magnets.
William Harding was his father ; but Mar-
lowe Harding was the guardian of Emily

Cuthbert observed that Geoffrey Mandeville's
eyes were fixed with an almost ludicrous
expression of wonder and entrancement.
While Geoffrey was telling his story of their
adventures at Huntingferry and at Mande-
ville Park, Miss Whitsund's face had been
shaded by one of the festoons of vine leaves
which hung from the ceiling; but, in her
interest, and in the eagerness of her atten-
tion, she had leant forward, as he concluded,
to transfer her gaze from the narrator, to the
hero of the tale ; and now, therefore, a ray
of the moonlight fully revealed her coun-
tenance to our astonished friend, Geoffrey.
It is only probable, in truth, that he had
never before beheld such a vision. Mention
has been made of the small estate which
Colonel Whitsund had bequeathed to his
daughter ; but her richest heritage, beyond
all comparison, she had derived straight
from nature.
Her slight form was of exquisite propor-

tion: her fair young head was set with
statuesque effect on the snow-white dazzling
throat, which made the ivory paper-cutter
with which she was playing, and which she,
ever and anon, applied in a musing attitude
to her roseate, dewy lips, look yellow and
dingy. She wore the great wealth of her
sheeny brown hair braided halfway off the
faint, delicate bloom of her oval cheeks, and
gathered into a loose copious knot at the
back, from which a few stray tresses hung
carelessly. The forehead, which was well
filled, displayed a trenchant elegance in the
outlines ; and, while producing a pensive
and gentle effect, if viewed from the full
front, offered a profile resolutely Greek, and
of the severest purity. A strange play of
greater and less lustrousness was occasioned
by the development of parts of this mode-
rately high forehead (for it was not an even,
expressionless, dead surface); and you

parency, and that some limpid light was
burning within, behind a slender screen of
alabaster. Her eyebrows, which were dark
brown, traced an almost oriental arch;
while the eyelashes, equally dark, and un-
usually long, almost shaded the pale cheek,
when she looked down. At such moments,
so still, and hushed, and harmonious, was
the expression of the whole head and coun-
tenance, that they gave you the idea of a
classic Muse in meditation, an aspect which
only rendered more startling the effect of
the bright blue eye, long and oval as the
almond, when the veil of those darkling
lashes was suddenly lifted, and when the
glittering, swordlike glance flashed forth.
The whole face was then wondrously irradi-
ated. The sleepy, dreamy, muselike statue
had vanished, and one feeling of admiration
was lost in another still deeper.
The
power which Emily Whitsund's
beauty exercised was not due to the mere

material perfection of the features and
person. That beauty had character, and
the character was not to be mistaken.
Loftiness and greatness of thought, tem-
pered by the physiognomical promise of an
unspeakably sweet and gracious disposition,
were marked in every line; while a certain
sadness, or, at least, pensiveness, not tran-
siently impressed, not even resulting from
the looks and play of the countenance, but
permanently appertaining to the very style
of it, and equally conveyed in the gentle
and slow manner, added a new interest

But, meantime, the first appearance, and all
the succeeding appearances, of the brave
soldier's beautiful orphan, in mixed society,
and in the character of one who had just
emerged from the tutelage of girlhood, had
occurred amid the comparatively retired
scenes and restricted circles of the country
where her guardian resided. Yet, in the
memory of the living, no such sensation had
been produced by a similar event, and long
was the remembrance of Emily Whitsund's
maiden career destined to be preserved.
Brief as hitherto that career had been, tattle

rently, flung out in the stories and discus-
sions of which some girl of unequalled, and
therefore envied, beauty is the subject.

in an epithet or denomination, it was true
in the letter, and false, as well as malignant,
in the spirit. It was not Miss Whitsund's
fault if she had refused, in a twelvemonth,
more offers of marriage than all the other
young ladies of the county together could
boast of having received within the previous
half-dozen years.
In not one of these in-
stances had she encouraged, by a heedless
word or look, the proposals which she de-
clined ; and yet she had declined, not with-

suitor; and the thought of his grief some-
times would cost her whole nights of sleep-
lessness. If she gave pain, she felt it. She
pained many, because she had pleased all.
She had trifled, however, with no one's
affections. She could not help the love
which several youths of the country, some
of whom had a very brilliant future to offer

taken love in her presence, as they might
have taken cold in a draught. But the
malady was pleasant up to a certain point,
and they would not avoid the occasion.
They it was who deserved the blame.
Meanwhile Dr. Marlowe Harding began
to feel more surprised that all these pro-
posals should be refused, than that so many
should be made. The reader knows more
of the cause than Emily's uncle by marriage
knew at first. Cuthbert Harding, just be-
fore Emily Whitsund was to enter the outer
world (when he would necessarily cease to
monopolize the opportunities of her society)

he anticipated with jealous repugnance and
presaging terror, had availed himself of the
advantage which hitherto none shared with

from childish companionship, and from long
habits of familiar affection, to build a ram-

part round the girl's liberty. He was, as
yet, without a rival; but rivals were coming
—they were at hand, and they were only
the more formidable because he could not
yet say who or what they might be. They
might be numerous ; they might be superior
to him in station, in personal accomplish-
ments, in congeniality with Emily's charac-
ter, in general suitableness ; his uncle,
moreover, would be likely to throw the
weight of a guardian's advice and influence
into the scale adverse to him; the associ-
ations of infancy, on which he placed his
chief reliance, were about to be effaced by
new and exciting relations : he would wait
no longer ; he would at once secure Emily
by an engagement, or she would, probably,
for ever escape him. He would bind and
fetter beforehand the
poor
child's moral
freedom, circumscribing her chances in life
to the orbit of his own destiny.
Such were the reflections of that wary

and precocious intelligence, and upon those
reflections he had acted. Unfair and cruel,
nine times out of ten, is an engagement
obtained under such circumstances and by
such means, and terrible are the eventual
consequences not seldom found to be. But,
in the present case, there was one element
which young Harding had not taken into
his calculations. In how many instances,
the refusal of so many advantageous matri-
monial offers, following each other rapidly
in one year—in how many such instances,
or whether in any one of them, the young
beauty had been influenced by the remem-
brance of the promise which bound her to
Cuthbert Harding, rather than by indiffer-
ence to the merits of the rejected suitor,
or by incapability of reciprocating his affec-
tion, will presently be seen. She felt herself
tied to Cuthbert; but, whether it was the
vow to him, or whether it was love for him,
which always had dictated her rejection of

others, and whether the recollection of the
vow itself (originally springing from her
childish partiality), was now calculated to
maintain or to foster that partiality, the
story will explain of itself. Having thus
briefly indicated the general situation of the
persons chiefly interested, I return to the
group in the conservatory of Lea Meadows.
Geoffrey Mandeville, having perfectly
satisfied himself, by the long and astonished
gaze which he bestowed on Miss Whitsund,
that the taste of his friend, young Harding,
was not at all at fault, and that the lady
before him might well be the object of any
man's love, suddenly recollected himself.
Her really extraordinary beauty had taken
him by surprise. He was ashamed to have
been betrayed into such ill manners; but
nobody had observed it, he hoped. And,
thereupon, with the look of a conscious
culprit, he turned in his chair, casting a
hasty glance round the circle. No-not

even Cuthbert had seen him. But at what
was Cuthbert smiling ?
Geoffrey was mistaken ; his friend had
noticed and had read that protracted stare
of amazed admiration, but he had averted
his sidelong, detecting glance in time to
escape Geoffrey's timid inspection.
Young Mandeville-partly, perhaps, to
cover or to divert a sense of awkwardness
now addressed to Miss Whitsund the request
already mentioned.
May I entreat of you, Miss Whitsund,
to favour us with a repetition of that en-
chanting song, which Cuthbert and I had
the luck to hear when we arrived half an
hour ago ?”
“Oh!" with pleasure ; " but I am more
used to sing it with another. Indeed, I
have always had a second, or have myself
made the second, till to-night. Would you
favour me by trying to take the second,
Mr. Mandeville ?”

Gey; "but, though passionately fond
of misie, I don't know a note of it. My

“A very fine voice, I know," said Miss
Whitsund, hastening to the aid of young
Mandeville's halting rhetoric. When not
roused by some stinging excitement, or
impelled by some powerful feeling, Geoffrey's
eloquence was habitually apt to stumble,
both in men's and in women's society—a
fatal defect, had not his worldly position
been secure.
Such persons seldom force
their own way in life. We all know the
boast of Wilkes, the most hideous-looking
individual of his age: “Give him half an

handsomest dull man you pleased, with any
woman equally a stranger to both, and he

sonal advantages.” So far, it was a com-
pliment to the understanding of women, a
compliment which is well deserved, since it
is indorsed by the testimony of every day's
experience. Young Mandeville had not
that habitual fluency or felicity in express-
ing himself, and he cared not a rush for it.
"So in that way of talking without thinking
He had a strange alacrity for sinking."
“A very fine voice, I know,” said Miss
Whitsund. "Will you, then,” she added,
looking at Cuthbert, with a sweet smile,
try the second with me?
There never
was a more simple air. It needs but to
be sung with feeling. I would not give
such trouble,” continued she, raising, from
a cushion at her feet, a pretty guitar, en-
amelled in mother-of-pearl,
only that I
have been spoilt in this song.
After once
perceiving the wonderful improvement it
acquires from the second voice, I dislike
singing it alone, if I can help it.”

not surprised at the surprise of Geoffrey,
for, even within the past year, and since he
had met her, Emily Whitsund's beauty had
been strikingly developed. Cuthbert, more-
over, was enthralled by various circum-
stances. Her acquaintance with other lan-
guages and other literatures (the natural
(
result of her education abroad), her superi-
ority to himself in knowledge of the arts,
and her grace of movement and of action,
produced on his mind an effect even deeper
than that caused by her surpassing beauty.
But that effect was accompanied by a vague
uneasiness. Was he the person most fitted
or most likely, by position, character, and
personal qualities, to captivate such a
maiden ?

in the brief, incipient scrawls of little Winny,

gossip from Mandeville Park), something of
the numerous offers with which Miss Whit-
sund had been besieged—something of that
blockade of love or admiration which she
had sustained. She had, it was rumoured,
refused this gentleman and that; she was
going to be married—no, it was broken off.

posed-splendid match—most extraordinary

fication-surely, Uncle Harding could see
nothing objectionable in such an alliance !
Could Emily herself have refused Lord

A feeling of pride, and a pang of anxiety,
were simultaneously awakened in Cuthbert
by these fragments of intelligence. He
applauded himself for the engagement by
which he had anchored his hopes; he had
foreseen the storms of passion or ambition
which would arise in that outer sea of the
great world upon which the young life of
Emily was about to be adventured, and he
had prepared for the crisis. But would the
cable stand the strain ? In what kind of
ground was it to drag ? Was he sure of her
character, on the one hand ? and could he
face his various rivals with a good chance of
superiority to all of them, on the other ?

position, and yet not dread the issue. But
were they all such as Geoffrey ? Among
the well-bred nobodies—among the ordi-
nary, average, polished rabble—was it
certain that not one brilliant character, not
one energetic heart and vivid intelligence,
was it certain that not one such should be
found ?
It may appear strange (for no decisive, no
direct clue whatever, pointed in that direc-
tion), but it is the case, that young Hard-
ing's mind was haunted for the last twenty-
four hours by the image, or by what served
for such—of one individual. There was one
name which seemed continually to be mur-
mured in his ear. But why dread that
individual ? why think he heard that name
in particular? He had never even seen the
person in question ; he could not know how
great or how small were his merits or attrac-
tions; and, what is more remarkable, he
had not heard that Miss Whitsund was so

much as acquainted with him. It is to
be ascribed, then, only to the self-tormenting
or presentimental character of certain minds,
that this one person should detach himself
from the vague and misty crowd whom
Cuthbert bodied forth in his imagination
as pursuing Emily Whitsund, and should
stand out clearly and sharply defined in the
visions of his jealous terror.
Cuthbert, when Miss. Whitsund asked
him to take the second part of the song,
rose, as has been stated, and, making an
apology for such a demand, asked his uncle,
with respectful audacity, to exchange chairs
with him.
The reverend gentleman looked, at first,
as though his nephew had asked him to
exchange coats, or even heads. But the
request was reasonable, it was even neces-
sary, and the defeated divine retreated
austerely. So far, so good ; but the youth's
triumph was short-lived. Miss Whitsund

handed him the music of the song, in which
the words were interlined.
"You wish me to sing this ?” he said.
Why, I cannot even read it! This is
a German song.
And thus, after a few confused remarks
on both sides, during which Miss Whitsund
innocently asked (to Dr. Marlowe Harding's
intense scandal), What, then, do they
teach you at Eton ?” she consented to sing
alone. This time the music failed to please
Cuthbert so highly as when he had heard it
first; but Geoffrey was more enthusiastic
than before.
“ You say,” said Cuthbert,
have been spoiled for singing that beautiful
song by yourself. You have, then, been
able to find, in our rustic circles, somebody
who not only knows music well enough, but
knows German also ?”
“Oh, yes. He sings beautifully. It was
he who gave me, and, indeed, taught me,

“I did not catch the name," pursued
Cuthbert.
“The name !” replied the lovely girl,
with an air of abstraction and pensiveness
which escaped not the uneasy glance and
much-conjecturing, much-misgiving mind of
Cuthbert, “the name! Oh, the name is
‘Die unglückliche Verbindlichkeit.'”
“Ehem!” answered Cuthbert,
" that
appears to be the name of the song in
German. But what is the name of the per-
son who knows German, and sings so well,
and gave you, and taught you, the song ?
The rest were now all talking, and no one
noticed the little dialogue apart, which was
carried on almost in a whisper.
“I beg a thousand pardons,” she said
with a faint blush, like the inside of a sea-
shell (the blush Cuthbert did not at all
relish). “I beg a thousand pardons. The

Cuthbert, although he had asked with a
presentiment of this name, started as if he
was shot, and fixed on the young lady a
searching glance, which again made the red
blood mantle in her cheeks; but this time
a slight tinge of indignation was blended
with her confusion. Innocence can blush as
well as guilt; and, indeed, innocence blushes
oftener; and, unaccountable as it may seem,
there are characters who, under the con-
sciousness of an inquisitorial scrutiny, will
betray more awkwardness if they do not
deserve it, than if they do. Guilt is pre-
pared, where innocence is not. Young
Harding had never read nor heard Paul
de Gondi's profound maxim, that, in dealing
with people, we should always suppress the
appearance or air of suspecting them, and,
nine times out of ten, even the suspicion
itself. It may be, Cuthbert had never heard
of this counsel (his studies had not extended
to French political and social literature) ;

but he felt instinctively, that, in the present
instance, he would be unwise to betray the
thoughts which were lurking “in the re-
cesses of a mind capacious of such things."
He took the guitar which Miss Whitsund
was placing back on the cushion, and, while
examining it, said, with an assumed look of
carelessness
“I have never had the pleasure of meet-
ing the younger Mr. Childering, but I hear
he is quite a superior person. What is he
like? Is he considered handsome ?”
For an instant, Miss Whitsund naturally
hesitated; but, with brave simplicity,
replied
“He is considered so, and is so.”
“So is my friend, Geoffrey Mandeville,”
pursued Cuthbert. “Is
young Mr. Childer-
ing endowed with such good looks ?”
This,” said Miss Whitsund, " is to me
quite a new point of view in which to regard

man.
I never thought whether he was, or
was not, handsome, till you asked me. Do
you generally ask ladies whether they con-
sider gentlemen handsome ?"
Although these abrupt words contained a
withering reproof of Cuthbert's ill-bred
question, they were not spoken with that
intention, but modestly and naturally. It
little mattered, however, for Cuthbert scarcely
heard them. His gaze was riveted upon
the guitar.
At the broader end, a small, round plate
of ivory, shaped like an heraldic shield, was
niello'd into the wood, and encircled with a
border of flowery inlaying. The plate was
obviously designed to receive initials, or a
name, or a crest, or a motto-or, in fine,
any little device which might suit the phan-
tasy of the owner. But it presented an
exquisite miniature portrait of Emily herself.
This it was which had arrested Cuthbert's
attention. He knew that Miss Whitsund

could draw and paint; but it was absurd to
suppose that she had sat down for this pur-
pose before her looking-glass. Most cer-
tainly, she would not have selected herself
as the person from whom she would "ask a
sitting." Besides, so far as his memory
served him, she, although sufficiently accom-
plished in the art, could not have drawn—
and, above all, she could not have painted
—in a style approaching the marvellous
excellence of the little fairy portrait before
him. It spoke of a master hand. Cuthbert
was lost for a few seconds in the contempla-
tion of that exquisite production. Two or
three times he sighed almost imperceptibly.
"Pardon me," said he, looking up at
length, "your manner to me is changed,
Emily. Do you forget all?"
"You can fear that I should forget? Is
it so?" she replied.
"No, no, dearest Emily; but I am so little worthy of you; so many would envy

thoughts; absence, you know, is always so
full of fears and self-torture. I most eagerly
await the opportunity of a long conversa-
tion. To-morrow, I shall rise early; let me
meet you; I have much to say, on which
my whole life depends. I shall expect you
in the old bridle path, which winds beyond
the garden—where we used once to stroll
together, Emily—yes, yes, building stately
castles in the air. Is no ruin of them all
left in your memory? You were never cold
and distant to me then! I cannot, here
and now, speak what is in my mind, what is
torturing it. Will you meet me?"
She bowed silently, with a look of sad
kindness—a sweet, pensive, pained expres-
sion. He noticed it.
"Before seven?" he added.
Again she bent her head.
"Thanks, from my heart, even for this,"
he said.

He still held the guitar.
“Until then, let me talk to you

address you, to hear your answers—however

which has rendered me so wretched. A
word, I repeat-even your brief, cold replies

and to speak with you. You seem pained !
Is my very presence become so disagree-
able ?”
“I seem what? Pained !”
“You scarcely answer me."
“Yes. I answer you,” said she.
Well, well,” he returned, with a sigh,
“I deliver you from all this—I free you
from the subject. To change it, let me
assure you that this guitar has given me a
shock of astonishment.”
“A shock of astonishment !” she replied,
stealing a timid glance towards him, which
made his heart throb fast.

“Yes,” pursued he ; "I had not thought
it within the means of mortal art, potent as
it is, to have done justice to that face and
head.”
“Oh!” she confusedly said, “the por-
trait !”
“Pray, whose work is the portrait ?”
asked he.
Miss Whitsund had nothing to conceal.
Indeed, what would have been the inference,
had she made any mystery of the question ?
Yet, the question jarred upon her feelings ;
she could not have said why. The reply,
however, jarred still worse on the feelings of
Cuthbert. It was one of those inquiries
which must be answered, and for this reason,
that silence itself is an answer, and happens
to be the least convenient that could be
given. Such inquiries are like some in-
visible lasso, flung true—you cannot shake
them off. Therefore, secretly and undefin-
ably displeased at feeling herself pressed,

pinioned, by the consummate, but unper-
ceived art of her lover, she said, coldly-
" The portrait is the work of Mr. Alger-
non Childering.'
“ He must be truly accomplished,” said
Cuthbert, slowly, and, as it were, with
difficulty.
The beautiful girl, who was deadly pale,
preserved silence. Cuthbert, with feelings
unspeakable in his heart, but calm and
elegant in look, manner, voice, now threw
again the unseen lasso.
“You could scarcely,” remarked he,
' have expected the task to be executed
in that artistic, that masterly style, when
you entrusted Mr. Algernon Childering with
the guitar, that he might fill up the ivory
plate, either thus, or as best his skill might
enable him.”

I found it again on my aunt's table,
with this miniature occupying the ivory

“Drawn and painted from memory,” mur-
mured Cuthbert
;
“there is certainly an
astonishing talent shown in such a freak;
it was gracefully imagined too."
Miss Whitsund looked at him to see if he
spoke ironically; but he was perfectly grave,
and was contemplating the likeness with
a candid and placid look of admiration.
Something bitter had, indeed, risen to his
lips; but he had a habit, when much in-
terested, of putting himself, imaginarily, in
the place of the person to whom he was
speaking, and then he would ask, mentally,
“ How would it sound ? how would it look ?
What would be the impression, the effect ? ”
Over anxiety made him lose this habit ere
his career was accomplished ; forgetting to
act on a maxim the justness of which he
well knew, and which, at this date, was

seldom out of his mind-that precisely by
how much more one is anxious, precisely by
that much it is the more needful not to be
tyrannized over, or influenced, by anxiety.
He felt, or he fancied, in the present in-
stance, that irony, sarcasm, could in no way
advance him ; that it would grate upon Miss
!
Whitsund's ear; and, in truth, that it would
be out of place in itself. The oftener he
heard of this Algernon Childering, the less
applicable to him appeared the assumption
of anything like a depreciatory—or, at all
events, a satirical tone. Nor was Cuthbert
at all anxious that Emily Whitsund should
impute to him an ungenial and sardonic
temper.
Thus musing, or
rather electrically
lightening, with an excited and thunder-laden
spirit, from reflection to reflection, Cuthbert
mechanically laid down the guitar, and, in
order to make room for it upon the cushion,
took up the printed song. During the low-

Harding and Winny were amused and
curious listeners.
By this means it happened that Cuthbert
and Emily were left to interchange, undis-
turbed and nearly unheeded, the questions
and answers I have mentioned. But there
was one person whose glance stole frequently
towards the youthful couple, and rested, not
without an expression of unquiet sympathy,
upon the pale brow of Cuthbert. One
glance there was which thus hovered round
him. It was his mother's. She had studied
too long and too closely her son's physiog-
nomy to be deceived by any of its phases.
She alone in the world had been entrusted,
from the beginning, with the secret of that
engagement in which her boy had garnered
up, as she believed, the hopes of his life, and
all his chances of happiness.
She had now followed, with a kind of
magnetic intuition, all the turns of a dia-
logue, not a word of which reached her

ears; and, although she could not have said
literally what passed, she could have said,
at least, in what mood Cuthbert uttered
each sentence, and what effect each sentence
of Emily's produced on him. It was curious
to see Mrs. Harding, as she mechanically
pursued her knitting, her look raised to the
speakers beyond hearing, as if they were not
beyond it, every inaudible word apparently
understood—occasionally the point of a long
needle applied absently to her temple (for
when Mrs. Harding was unusually medita-
tive, she would thus scratch her temple with
the point of her needle)-occasionally, again,
as she looked, she heaved an unconscious
sigh.
But what has now happened? Ah I what
has happened ? Mrs. Harding had become
very pale; she had dropped her work into
her lap; her hands were folded quietly to-
gether upon her knees; and a tear stood in
her eyes. Long and sad was the

she fixed upon her son. What she beheld
in his face I cannot explain ; all I can
do is to record what had passed, at that
moment, between Miss Whitsund and Cuth-
bert Harding.
It has been stated that young Harding, in
putting down the guitar on the cushion, had
mechanically taken up, to make room for it,
In doing this, the title caught
his eye. He could hardly, at that moment,
trespass on Miss Whitsund to the extent of
asking her to translate the whole of the
words for him ; yet he burned to know what
it was that the girl who was plighted to him
—what it was that she and this Algernon
Childering had often, doubtless, sung to-
gether. The thought flashed across his
mind that, if he knew the title, he might
be able to guess at the style, the class of
song, and, perhaps, the general drift and
very purport of the words. He could not
forget with what melancholy pathos, with

what plaintive feeling, with what an im-
passioned, trembling emotion, Emily's sweet
voice, as he and Geoffrey listened outside,
had penetrated through the casement, and
had seemed to soar away like a complaint to
Heaven.
Thus brooding, he pointed to the heading,
and said

those words.
“ And that means in English-- ?” per-
sisted Cuthbert, on whom nothing in the
lady's manner was lost—“how do you trans-

the music, more and more disconcerted;

Cuthbert slowly, dreamily, turned towards
her. He fixed upon her a long and melan-
choly gaze; then he rose from his chair,
and, without uttering one word, left the
verandah and retired into the large adjoin-
ing room, in which, as I have mentioned,
nobody had remained.
It was at this moment, and on seeing this
movement of her son's, that Mrs. Harding
had betrayed the emotion which had been
described.

phlegmatic prowess, to dislodge Winny from
the chair beside Geoffrey Mandeville, as
soon as he—that reverend and redoubtable
doctor—had been deprived of his own beside
his beautiful ward, by the adroit audacity

of Cuthbert. Winny, thus dispossessed, cast
her eyes round the circle, and at first seemed
inclined to follow Cuthbert, and again plague
him to solve the multifarious problems which
succeeded each other, like bubbles in an
eddy, or grains of dust from a threshing-
floor, in her very discursive conversation.
But she vaguely felt, as she glanced at the
earnest and preoccupied air of the two, that
this was no moment to disturb her brother
and Miss Whitsund. The next truth which
beamed on her observant mind was, that
,
ail who usually took note of her movements,
and curbed her rather devious, erratic, and
eccentric orbits, were now fully absorbed.
She noiselessly vanished, therefore, into the
outer room, and thence went on an exploring
expedition to the kitchen, to ascertain in
what state of forwardness was the repast
which she knew that her mother had
ordered to revive her "travelling ” son and
his friend.

Mrs. Harding still sat gazing with her
wan and piteous eyes on her son's abruptly
deserted place (the incident which was men-
tioned at the close of the last chapter,
having just occurred), when Winny burst
into view between the folding doors, with
the highly satisfactory intelligence which
she thought proper to announce thus :

“You ought to be in bed.”

Humphrey is only just laying the cloth, I saw him."
"Where is your brother, dear?" said
Mrs. Harding, looking all round the veran-
dah in vain.
At that moment, Cuthbert reappeared in
the doorway, against the sill of which he
leant, throwing an arm round the neck of
Winny, who turned and gazed up at him
with a smile, saying—
"I knew very well it was you?"
Not a trace of emotion remained now on
the youth's countenance. It was open and
calm—the sole change (and none but his
mother remarked even this) was, that the
light which burned in his dark grey eyes
was more than usually vivid—while the
daring character natural to the whole face,
seemed to her to be somehow brought out
with more marked effect. Only a practised
painter or sculptor could have laid his finger
on the particular lineaments which produced

have proceeded from the lineaments at all,
but from a certain gallant, challenging sit
of the head, which was well thrown back.
Winny's proclamation had broken up the
doctor's and Geoffrey's conference, and had
drawn all eyes towards her. The conse-
quence was distressing, for Mrs. Harding,
after perusing the child's costume with an
understanding glance, demanded—
"Where is your beautiful new plum-
coloured silk sash, Winny? What have you
done with it, child?"
Winny held down her head sideways, and
hearing Cuthbert utter a low laugh, looked
up at him out of the corners of her eyes,
with mingled astonishment and anxiety.
"I know where it is," said Cuthbert,
darting at her a penetrating glance.
"I'm sure you don't," murmured Winny,
her mind, however, much misgiving her,
despite of that stout asseveration.

She vanished. When she returned, she
had her plum-coloured silk sash round her
waist, but looking disgracefully crumpled.
Humphrey just then appeared, and an-
nounced supper.
Cuthbert instantly approached Emily
Whitsund, and offered her his disengaged
arm, for Winny hung fast upon the other.

Geoffrey took Mrs. Harding, the doctor and
his brother following last.
Mrs. Harding, who was separated from
Cuthbert only by Winny, took advantage
of the little stir which the guests made in
finding their places, to lean across the
child's shoulders, and to whisper to her
son-
“Your uncle talked of having some
serious conversation with you, Cuthbert,
darling; but I'm afraid he's going to do
something horrid. I don't know that he
means to speak to you privately. Be pre-
pared ! ”

Cuthbert, much surprised, replied, in the
same low tone-
“ How ! not privately ?”
“Just this instant," continued Mrs.
Harding, "I partially overheard him talking
to your father respecting you, as we were
all coming from the verandah, and I caught
something about the wholesome shock of an

There was no time to say more ; every-
body was seated, and silence prevailed for a
moment. It was soon broken in general
conversation, the doctor leading off on the
subject of
“ table rapping."
Cuthbert
wanted to think, but Winny would not let
him.
“How did you know about the sash,
Cuth ?” she demanded.
Why, I saw you dart through the draw-
ing-room with one of your stockings about
your heels, and I saw you come back with
the same stocking all right and trim again,
to announce's—u-upper, supper.' Never-
theless, I had, meantime, observed your lost
garter upon the floor, where I told you
afterwards to look for it. I had no idea
how

and arranging his future for him, before
he himself could have any voice in its
settlement.

She paused to look at Cuthbert, but, dis-
daining all affectation, said-
“Yes, he knows those languages, and
knows the countries where they are spoken.”
“And,” persisted young Harding, “after
travelling a good deal, and observing a good
deal, while still a mere boy, he has now
come home-has he not ?-to settle in this
county ?"
“I believe so. I think his father--who,
along with Sir Walter Mandeville, you
know, represents the shire in Parliament-
has said something about resigning his seat,
and putting forward his second son, who is
only just coming of age, as a candidate in
his place.”
“His second son !” exclaimed Cuthbert.
“Is not Mr. Algernon, then, his eldest, his
heir ?"
“Oh, certainly not !”

Here Cuthbert shuddered violently, be-
came deadly pale, and looked quickly back
over his chair.
“ Emily,” said he, in a whisper, "you

“No !” said she, more astonished by his
manner than by the question—"that is, I
heard the voices at table, together with the
busy sound of knife and fork—what do you
mean?
“Oh, nothing-nothing," he replied, in
visible confusion. He hastily added-
“ Have you met the elder brother? What
sort of person is he ?”
“The exact contrary of Mr. Algernon,'
she replied.
“ From all I can gather,” said Cuthbert,
" that is not flattering—I mean, no favour-
able description of him.”
“Of course, very unfavourable,” she said,
with involuntary emphasis.
Doctor Marlowe, who (surpassing Zo-

but a great many, tables—all, in fact, on
which any “rappings" had been practised-
overheard Miss Whitsund's last remark, and
exclaimed-
“You are speaking, I presume, of Mr.
Childering's eldest son, George. The greatest
scapegrace in the kingdom! The estate is
strictly entailed on him, and he has already
run pretty nearly through his own future
life interest in it, by means of the most
costly kind of post obits. If his father
do not die immediately, Mr. George will be
a ruined man by the time he comes into the
property. If I were his father, I would
never suffer him under my roof. In these
days of clear-seeing through the mahogany,
and strychnine on it, and of rapping tables
for imps, there is no telling what he might
not be capable of attempting.”
Oh, pray do not speak so fearfully, so
horribly, guardian,” said Miss Whitsund.

“Mr. George may be wild, wicked, and yet
not an assassin—not a parricide.”

I happen to know of an incident in this
unhappy young man's career, of which
incident you, Emily, are ignorant. During

tion of Septimus Hodge, the poisoner-his
former dwelling at Ditchend became, as you
are aware, the object, the terminus, the
bourne, of a largely frequented and scan-
dalous pilgrimage, while the very ground
on which he had trodden was venerated and
treated as precious. Hundreds of thousands
repaired to the shrine of this singular saint
---and the very pebbles which paved the
little garden walk leading up to his door
were worth a shilling and (as they grew
scarce) half-a-crown a piece! It is a posi-
tive fact, that not one of those pebbles
which had been pressed by the sole of the
caitiff murderer's foot, remains now in that

bought up as relics by the devotion, the
zeal, of the countless relays of ever suc-
ceeding pilgrims. We sneer at the Roman
Catholics for making pilgrimages to the
tombs or homes of martyrs and saints-- for
seeking and treasuring the relics of such
persons as have died glorious deaths, after
living blameless lives ; the relics, in short,
of those who have become famous by sheer
goodness; and here is a wretch who, by
sheer badness, sheer devilry, has, in about
the same measure and degree, distinguished
himself from the ordinary bulk and herd of
men, and you cannot count the crowds of
devotees to be found in civilized, enlightened
England, who flock to the spots where he
has left any print or trace of himself, in
quest of some memorial by which they may,
respectively, more vividly realize the indi-
vidual, and retain within reach a means of,

magic! Horrible—I say horrible ! And

Here the doctor paused for breath, and
looked round him with a glance of indigna-
tion, as if the company present had been the
culprits to whom the invectives of his
power-
ful and acrid eloquence were applicable.

that young Harding was all this time lying
nervously under the expectation of the im-
pending stroke with which he had been
threatened ; and, for this reason, that he
would be now incapable of supporting his
share in a mixed and general conversation ;
in fine, it might be supposed that, whoever
might be likely to answer the doctor, and to
fling back the volatile ball of discussion, it
would not be Cuthbert.

Young Harding smiled with an expression
of surprise and pleasure.

clergyman. “Well, in this huge moral

than that young gentleman. He not only
joined in those infatuated and outrageous
pilgrimages, the dishonour of our social
state, the shame and infamy of our age-
he not only purchased the sacred pebbles
of the gravelled walk, like the rest of that
rabble of demented miscreants—but he,
alone of all, devised a new and peculiar
method of testifying the general interest
in the miscreant, the fiendish criminal, who
had just fittingly finished so delightful a
career upon the gallows. He alone thought
of inquiring where the hypocritical murderer
habitually sat in church (for this poisoner
by profession was regular in his attendance
at church); and he actually placed himself
in the pew, and there he remained, wrapt
in ecstatic musings for upwards of an hour.
By such touches, believe me, character is
glaringly revealed. The Greek, in ponder-
ing at the grave of Leonidas, was exalted

Christian, as he bends over the hallowed
spots of Palestine, is inebriated with a divine
enthusiasm ; and Mr. George Childering, as
he meditated in the pew of Septimus Hodge,

and influences of the place, inspirations
worthy of the dock, and sentiments that
may yet befit him to emulate his chosen
prototype's career. We are all friends here.

But in one sense, at least, the doctor's
remark was not true; he had spoken not
as if in his family, but as if in the pulpit,
his voice making the very walls vibrate
with its thunder. And, indeed, the style
of all that diatribe which has been re-
ported, concerning the pilgrimages to the
poisoners home, much resembled that of

his more ardent homilies and furibund
discourses.
Dr. Marlowe Harding was a most remark-
able man. His abilities were of the highest
order, and of singular amplitude in the range
which they embraced ; they had breadth as
well as height. But it was especially by
his rough, vigorous, vehement, and nerve-
shaking eloquence that he was distinguished.
He was, beyond all comparison, the first
preacher in the “Establishment.” In short,
only for his unusual—but I was going to say
that he was “ too gifted for a bishop.” It
is possible to cite exceptions to that rule
of patronage which, for years, marked the
policy of Dr. Marlowe Harding's friends ;
but it was, nevertheless, only by a daring
menace he had got the living in which he
now thundered. He uttered that menace on
two occasions: on the first he was laughed
at ; on the second, he was installed in the
rectory of Panes cum Piscibus. The ancc-

one, and, indeed, of two whole classes of
persons, is worth relating :
“I'm beginning to feel very like a Dis-

senter,” quoth Dr. Marlowe Harding to his
old college chum, Lord A then high in
the Cabinet.
“Well, feel like one, my dear fellow,”
returned that earl (bearer of one of the most
ancient Saxon titles)—“ feel like one,

if
you
think it nice, or that it will do you any
good.”
May be, it will do others harm, my
lord,” answered the indignant doctor ; and
he forthwith hired a large public building,
which he so crowded, by the attractions
of his unhackneyed, novel, genuine, and
startling style, that the galleries broke
down during his "third appearance,” and
some of the close packed, overwhelming
audience actually lost their lives-several

From among these ladies, after attending
the coroner's inquest, the successful preacher
selected one, who had a small property,
the sister of the late Colonel Whitsund,
married her, and withdrew (professedly
only for a time) from the temporary

famous.
Just as he was emerging back into view,

“Ah! my lord,” says the doctor, eye-

“I

And thus, to parody a famous line of
Alexander Pope's, Dr. Marlowe Harding,
having foamed a free preacher, subsided a
rich rector.
But, to account for the extraordinary
scene which has now to be related, and
which took place at the supper table of
Lea Meadows, I must beg the reader's in-
telligent and kind attention to another of
the doctor's talents, a talent less creditable
than eloquence in his profession. He was
what

be termed a “social diplomatist,"
of the most original genius. He was never
known to fail in having any project adopted
which he undertook to support, within the
sphere of his family, or of his intimate
friends. He was certain to carry anything
which he recommended.
Such success—success so continued and
uniform-is never the result of accident.

He had discovered a secret upon which he
acted—a moral lever, which many use, in-
deed, in an unconscious and clumsy manner,
but which, probably, not another person
living knew how to employ, or had so
often purposely and systematically em-
ployed, to heave out of the way impedi-
ments which obstructed his plans of interest
or ambition.
But he had never yet had occasion to
try the efficacy of his hitherto infallible
engine, or manoeuvre against the pro-
verbially obstinate tenacity of love ; he
was now about to make that supreme ex-
periment. Guardians and uncles have im-
memorially been plagued with the difficulty
of controlling the perverse attachments of
wards and nephews; but guardians and
uncles had not known the secret, the art,

Before stating what was this secret of

will be well to mention at once another
secret which he had discovered.
that of Cuthbert's engagement with Miss
Whitsund. The discovery was not a day
old. From Eton, Cuthbert had corres-
ponded with the lovely orphan, uneasily
conjecturing, through her later replies, the
new sphere in which she had begun to
move, the gay circles into which she had
been introduced. The engagement was not
to be disclosed to her guardian till Cuth-
bert returned, and disclosed it himself. It
is of no importance to the events which
I am recording to explain the means by
which Cuthbert had contrived to conceal
the correspondence. Enough to say that
his last letter had been intercepted by Dr.
Harding, and had revealed everything.

“Mrs. Harding," said the doctor to his
wife, holding this letter in his hand,“ have
you noticed the pointed attentions of Mr.

It was on the morning of the very day
of Cuthbert's return home, that the doctor
put this question to his wife.
“I was going to ask you the same thing,”
said she.
“Well,” pursued the doctor, “I am certain
that our dear Emily is greatly struck by
that young gentleman.'
“ It is not wonderful,” said the wife.
“By no means,” continued the doctor.
“Now, in such houses as that of the
Childerings', there is generally an ample
provision for the younger children.”
“I don't know," said the wife. “I think
Mr. Childering married for love; and, you
are aware, his own property is strictly en-
tailed."

is. He has, I am convinced, crept into
Emily's affections. He is, himself, passion-
ately enamoured. And, now look
you,
Mrs.
Harding—I am not a bishop!”
Startled by this most unexpected con-
clusion, Mrs. Harding meekly answered-
“I know that, my dear.”
“Well,” resumed the doctor, “so far we
are agreed. I am not a bishop! But Emily
is tenderly attached to you; you have great
influence over her. You will still, in your
soft, unostentatious way, exercise that in-
fluence and retain that affection when she is
Mrs. Algernon Childering.”
“When she is, you say !”

I have drawn him into a confidential avowal

well that the rogue had

dutiful appeal to her guardian. The proof

pursued the usual course.

posthumous honour of Septimus Hodge,
Doctor Harding's wary glance alighted on
him repeatedly in lambent, threatening,
momentary flashes. Fully roused by his
mother's warning, he awaited the opening of
the batteries so long masked. Every instant
he said to himself, “Now it is coming!”
And this brings us to the doctor's secret-
to that powerful expedient in which he
placed so much confidence, as a means of
beating down the opposition of family
or of friends to any of his favourite
schemes.
As he was a clergyman, it will appear
curious, incongruous, but it is literally true,
that his great art consisted in a well-timed
and judiciously-daring disregard of de-
corum. It is proverbially said—and, indeed,
it is self-evidently clear—that between two
antagonists pretty evenly matched, all
coilision must eventuate in favour of him

most. Now, in the contests of his social
or domestic diplomacy, the doctor was
always ready to sacrifice more than his
adversary, be the last who he might. One
would go as far as throwing away his
picked regiments; so would the doctor, and
his reserves besides. Another would sacri-
fice his stores ; so would the doctor, and the
field baggage into the bargain. He never
thought the same of Napoleon's genius after
reading the true version of the battle of
Borodino, where that great captain (stupefied
by an influenza, and yielding to hypochon-
driac presentiments) left his own victory
incomplete, by refusing to send his old, or
even his young, guard in pursuit. “I must
economise my guard,” muttered Napoleon,
under the cloud of a passing hallucination.
“ Fudge !” said the doctor; “economise
his guard! What he economised was his
success; that is what he stinted. He, for
once, prized his means more than his end.

He ought to have paid with his guard ;
he ought to have expended all, all the
instruments that were needed for a con-
clusive success, a crowning triumph. The
Russians, even artistically speaking, de-
served to drive him out of their country,
for they were ready to risk and to sacrifice
more than he was.”
Now, the doctor was always ready to
pay with his guard. In the contests which
he maintained around him, to carry various
objects, he sought to make his adversary
confused—to overwhelm him with shame.
The situations into which he dragged the
opponent with whom he might have to
wrestle, were morally painful—they were
insufferable to almost everybody else. But
to him, as the intended results of his own
deliberate contrivance, they were simply
flattering and agreeable.

hand-—" hush; the neighbours will hear

Well, if that consideration dismayed the
lady, it did not dismay the gentleman ; if
that restrained her, if that induced her to
resign the battle, why it was just what
he reckoned on. If she would not value
her victory at such a price, he would value
his at even a higher—he would go all
lengths—he would risk anything; he was
deliberately desperate—he would pay with
his guard, if necessary.
She could not disregard the ordinary
decencies of their repute among the circles
in which they moved ; but the doctor dis-
regarded everything, at present, as he as-
sured her, in comparison with what he
held to be his duty, or his right, in the
question disputed between them ; and, until
she saw it was as he wished her to see it,

petty anxieties very cheap indeed. They
were irrelevant, extraneous, idle. :
“Well, there! there !” she would at last
cry, “be it so. I don't want the whole world
to be made a party to our discussion.”
“ Then, my love, you will not another
time fly right in the teeth of your husband's
plans,” he would rejoin. There were occa-
sions in which, had the doctor unfolded
beforehand his projected measures, people
would have said—
“Surely, that will be indelicate, reverend
sir !"
"Just what he desired; he meant it to be
indelicate, very indelicate, deucedly indeli-
cate. Ay, and he would find some way of
being more indelicate still, if people forced
him. If they couldn't live in the storm into
which he would lead them- be it known
that he was the storm petrel.”
Upon this principle, it will easily be felt
what a master stroke he designed to aim at

Master Cuthbert's hardy crest. The first
thing was to put that youth into some
intolerably painful situation. The doctor
promised himself that he, Doctor Marlowe
Harding, would bear the pain of that situa-
tion with as much heroism as he once had
borne the most cruel of all surgical opera-
tions, when performed by the untrembling
hand of the late eminent Mr. Liston, upon a
dear friend of the doctor's.
A profound silence followed the powerful
invective against Mr. George Childering. It
was broken by Cuthbert himself.
“And those post obits you mentioned,
uncle,” said he. “I suppose it was in
London that the money for them was pro-
cured by Mr. George ?”
“Not altogether,” replied the doctor,
peeling a fine pear. “ Jack Brompton, who
bought the little estate called the Limes,
which adjoins my own parish, gave him a
good portion of that fatal assistance. That

Brompton, William, is a curious character;
do you ever see him now ?”
“Very seldom; only when I chance to
meet him on the parade at Leamington.
He is too busy, making money. Besides, I
rather avoid him, you know.”
“Ah !” said the doctor, “no very desir-
able acquaintance, I allow. Still you re-
member what old Rothschild used to say,
that the unlucky were the people to avoid.
There is a class of persons, often very nice,
very clever, very good, but who are un-
lucky, who never do succeed in anything.
Fowell Buxton's memoirs tell us what a
horror old Rothschild had of such cha-
racters.”
“Yes,” replied William ; "he was indig-
nant with them ; he had no patience with
them. By the rule of contraries, this
Brompton is a man to know.”
“ Is he, then, very lucky ?" inquired
Cuthbert.

“Everything he touches turns to gold,”
said Mr. Harding. “He was a stable boy
originally. He made a fortune, small or
great, at Newmarket; then came back to
this county (he is a Warwickshire man),
and, to the surprise of old acquaintances,
bade a high price for the Limes. There is
never an auction of house or factory pro-
perty which he does not attend within fifty
miles round. He is the dread of intending
purchasers.”
“Why so ?” asked Cuthbert.
“Because he knows within an ace the
value of the property, and he will go nearer
to that value in his bidding than anybody
else dare.”
“Pays with his guard,” muttered Dr.
Marlowe Harding.
“Eh, uncle ?” said Cuthbert. “I missed
what you said.”
“I said he was a clever man, sir.”
A singular thought flashed through Cuth-

bert's mind; this thought showed itself
later ; meanwhile, it is remarkable that he
should have been struck so much as he
was by the fact, that the individual under
discussion was a constant frequenter of
auctions, and a sagacious, a prosperous
bidder.
“ Have this Brompton's purchases at
auctions always turned out well ?” he in-
quired.
“Invariably," said his father. “His
fame has become a proverb for that very
circumstance."
“And he is known and notorious,” con-
tinued Cuthbert, “ for being a keen, money-
making man ?”
“Yes, well known, quite notorious,” inter-
posed the uncle, anticipating Mr. Harding,
and looking towards Cuthbert with some
surprise at the free, large share he took in
the conversation, as well as at the interest
he seemed to feel in this Brompton.

“He's not a man,” persisted the youth,
“to make a sacrifice for friends ?”
“Of them, if you please,” said the doctor.
“But for them—he is beyond the reach of
such a suspicion, sir.”
"And why did you say you rather avoided
him, father?”.
“Well,” said Mr. Harding, “I don't much
like these favourites of Heaven and of old
Rothschild. Besides, the man has grown
deaf; he can hardly hear one's voice.”
“His usurious conduct towards Mr. George
Childering,” remarked the doctor, “shows
that he is so deaf, at least, as not to hear
the still, small voice of conscience.”
The general conversation dropped, and
Cuthbert, catching the magnetic flash of his
mother's anxious eye, and then darting an
inquiring glance towards his uncle, said to
himself, once more—“ It is coming now.”
This time he was right.
“ Cuthbert,” said the doctor, quietly,

amidst the profound silence of all the rest
who were at table, “I return to Panes cum
Piscibus to-morrow morning, and I do not
know that I could have a better opportunity
than this of speaking to you, in the presence
of your family, respecting some points in
your conduct which I consider impossible to
pass over.”
Geoffrey Mandeville half rose from his
seat, and said,
“I think I may be in the way; I will
retire-I--"
“By no means !” cried the doctor, in
reply to this suggestion, which, it need
scarcely be said, was prompted by Geoffrey's
inborn and ever wakeful sense of delicacy,
for he was thoroughly a gentleman. The
doctor's object, however, was to combine as
many indelicacies as possible in the situa-
tion. Geoffrey's presence was but an addi-
tional battery of artillery by which he
counted upon overwhelming Cuthbert's self-

possession or assurance (if such impediments
should be encountered), and fairly annihi-
lating the poor lad's resistance.
“Pray be seated, Mr. Mandeville. You
are Cuthbert's friend; his confidential friend,
I have reason to believe.” (The intercepted
letter had alluded to Geoffrey as the only
person, except Cuthbert's mother, cognizant
of the engagement between the writer and
Miss Whitsund.) “What I have to speak
of is no secret. I dare say even that my
nephew will be glad of your presence.”
Geoffrey resumed his place in silence.
“Cuthbert, it was I who sent you to
Eton,” pursued Doctor Harding. “I had
great hopes for you. I have received careful
reports of your conduct, your studies, your
progress in them. Your idleness has frus-
trated plans dear to my heart. I am dis-
appointed in you !”
The doctor paused; Mr. and Mrs. Hard-
ing looked frightened, or humbled (Cuthbert

saw this); Miss Whitsund fully shared the
awkwardness of the situation ; she cast her
eyes down, lest, by happening to look at
Cuthbert, she might aggravate the disagree-
ableness of his position, and the confusion
natural under such an unexpected address—
or, rather, apostrophe. Little Winny ner-
vously clutched her brother's hand under
the table, and whispered—
“Cuth ! Winny loves you, Cuth !”.
As for Geoffrey Mandeville, after a furtive
glance towards his friend, his handsome,
open countenance became flushed to the
roots of his hair, and he stared at Doctor
Harding with an expression which it is im-
possible to describe.
“Cuthbert !” resumed Doctor Harding,

we can speak another time. But there is
one subject which will not brook delay.

Geoffrey Mandeville : you are not one of

those young men in whom it may be ac-
cepted as an act of generosity that they
should take another person's destiny and
fasten it, so to speak, to their own. You
are not one of those with whom it is an
advantage to tie up another's fortunes for
life. In you it is no kindness to say to an
artless, inexperienced, helpless girl, you shall

perfidious, cowardly, and, above all, a cruel,
a most unmerciful proposal. You do not
offer immense benefits, as some might, but
immense calamities. It is not for you to
play off these grand airs, sir ! To a few,
Providence has granted a station which it is
obviously kind in them to share with the
almost portionless girl whom they may
select. But you, sir, you bring ruin to her !
For, however well you might force your own
way without such an imprudence, commit it,

from all her legitimate chances. It is only
for those who are hereafter to be great terri-
torial princes, or otherwise secured in their
future—it is not for lads like you—to take
such a step with honour; to take it, I will
say the word, without baseness. What sort
of love is that which says to a poor girl,
come and share my misery, my privations,
my ruined life-ruined even by our very
union itself? What sort of love is it which
says this to a young lady, who otherwise
could look forward to a brilliant destiny?
What sort of love is it which says this clan-
destinely, furtively, thievishly!—and says it
to the ears of her inexperience and sim-
plicity, to the confiding heart of her child-
hood ?—which abuses and betrays alike the
blind, fond trust of an orphan's only pro-
tectors, and the guilelessness of the poor
child herself? What name does such love
merit?

in a voice of thunder, and with a glance, a
play of countenance, worthy of Edmund
Kean ; “this is not all! May I not ask,
with equal reason, what kind of love that
youthful lady's would be, if she in return-
when her maturer understanding was capable
of passing judgment on the follies of her
childish imagination—should, in no less
degree, or, rather, in a greater degree, stand
in the way of that youth's advancement as
a fatal, an insuperable bar—if she should
hang herself like a millstone round his neck,
and sink him in the stormy sea of fortune-
if she should blast his otherwise excellent
chances, and blight all his prospects in life
irreparably? According to my idea, this
would betoken neither a becoming pride in
herself, nor a true interest in his welfare !”.
Doctor Harding paused, and ran his eye
round a circle, in which there was only one
person whose face did not exhibit a sort of
consternation. With that exception, the

vexation and confusion were general. Miss
Whitsund had, for a moment, seemed about
to swoon ; but, fascinated by the strangeness
of the unexpected scene, spellbound by
astonishment and curiosity, eager, above all,
despite of her compassion, to see how Cuth-
bert would behave, she remained fixed in
her place—an intent, although a suffering
listener.
"On my word, sir,” said Geoffrey, “you
must excuse me, but this is a very painful
-ahem—sort of thing for a stranger to be
present at. You must suffer me to ret— "
“I pray you to remain,” said the doctor,
in a low, emphatic voice. “I have done.”
But he had not done. His theory (beside
the grand secret of his diplomacy, already
analysed for the reader's information) was
this : foolish lovers have hitherto, in general,
been preached at in vain, because separately;
so that each has held firm by thinking of
the absent one, who is arrayed in fond or

in heroic colours, as the case may be.
The thing to do, therefore, was to bring
them together, and to make them look
foolish in their own and in each other's
eyes; to make them realize the contempt or
pity of the larger world, by tearing them from
their self-made microcosm, their own small
ideal world; to gather into one short, pal-
pable, present hour all the scattered coldness
and involuntary compunctions of many a
future year of disillusion and disappoint-
ment.
The doctor had not done. The youthful
pair were under his blade, which had still
to search their vitals. Emily's burning
blushes were succeeded by a mortal pallor;
she sat as far back from the table as was
possible, without rendering the position con-
spicuous, instead of the contrary. Cuthbert's
countenance, towards which she for an
instant looked stealthily, was not pale, but
livid. During his uncle's animadversions,

or rather philippic, the boy's eyes were,
for the most part, cast down; it was only
for brief intervals he looked at the speaker;
but then an electric flash and a white heat
seemed to dart from the uplifted glance. In
all other respects it was clear he was master
of the tempest within. An invincible com-
posure maintained itself strangely above the
excitement. He could, amidst the tempest
of his feelings, whatever they were—
“Ride in the whirlwind and conduct the storm."
His aspect produced an undefinable impres-
sion upon Emily; she never afterwards
forgot it. That look, not of amiable con-
fusion, but of collected power, in the
youthful face, that deeply thoughtful brow,
amazed her more than it consoled or re-
assured. Mrs. Harding, who had expected
to behold her poor boy overwhelmed by
the doctor's unmerciful, unrelenting rhetoric,
was even still more confounded by Cuth-
bert's strange self-possession, than she would

have been by any outburst of passionate
emotion. Meanwhile, Mr. Harding, the
father, in a kind of stupid and disagreeable
trance, continued to crack the five knuckles
of each hand in unceasing succession, look-
ing alternately at the doctor, at Cuthbert,
and at the ceiling.
The only person present who never once
took eyes off Doctor Harding was Winny.
She did not quite comprehend all his words;
still less could she follow his allusions ; but
she felt that “Cuth” was on his trial, and
that the prosecutor was Uncle Marlowe.
Her little fingers, which Cuthbert had dis-
engaged from his hand, had seized the
lappet of his coat, which they grasped with
a firmness which seemed to say, “I am
determined not to leave you,” while her face
was turned away to listen to every word
launched from Doctor Harding's sonorous
mouth.
When the doctor had last paused, and

when Geoffrey was a second time prevented
by him from retiring, a moment's nervous
silence ensued, and so deep was it that the
buzz of a fly, as it skimmed over the table,
seemed painfully distinct.
“Yes,” resumed Dr. Harding, solemnly,
"such love, I may well say, would show
neither maidenly pride in herself, nor com-
mon interest in him. But, suppose some-
· thing more than all this ; suppose that the
youth who thus cruelly seeks to destroy
the future of her who equally destroys his
own, by a union which is not only ruin
to themselves, but the regret, the disappoint-
ment, and the shame of both their families
-suppose, I say, that this youth does not
possess the love of this girl-suppose that
he holds her childish word, indeed, but has
no hold on her woman's heart, what would
all decent, self-respect dictate then? How
would his very sense of dignity prompt him
to act in that case? What course would

even the interests of his hoped-for home
(since he has no regard for the general
interests of his position in life) urge him to
pursue? What course but to give back
to that girl her premature and inconsiderate
promise, since it could not be ratified by
her affections ?”
Here, undoubtedly, at length, Cuthbert
started, as if an adder had bitten him. He
suddenly and rapidly sought Emily Whit-
sund's eye ; but she was weeping, and her
face was buried in her handkerchief.
“That is but little,” pursued the relentless
divine—“ that is but little ! Suppose that
she not only does not and cannot love
him, but actually loves another ? What
then?”
A half scream, and a series of convulsive,
smothered sobs, broke the stillness of the
pause which followed that terrible, pitiless,
and all-revealing question. It need not
be said who betrayed this agitation. This

time, Cuthbert did not look round. He
looked deep into his own reflections and
observations, and saw there, as in a mirror,
things absent; saw far more than the
material scene around would have disclosed
to him.
“What,” resumed the doctor, who felt
highly flattered by that half scream, and
those smothered sobs—" what should we
think of either the reason or the morality
of that young lady, if she should attach
high importance to a silly promise which
she had no right to make—made to a mere
human being—but no importance at all to
a promise to be made to the Almighty ; if
she should imagine herself bound by truth
to a boy, to tell an untruth to Heaven ?—if
she should fancy it a duty to become
sacrilegiously perjured—a duty, her duty,
to forswear herself at the altar—if she should
deem it right and necessary to vow solemnly

person, when she loved another? What,
then, I ask—what, then?”
The sobs redoubled. Exceedingly gratified,
the doctor resumed :
“Such an engagement. (worth nothing,
because contracted between two persons,
neither of whom had the least right to make
it—not even the child gentleman, and still
less the child lady)—exists? It must be
dissolved. The honour, the interests, the
proper self-respect, the most obvious dictates
of a becoming pride, if they know what it is
—the domestic safety and happiness of both
these young persons, as well as all feelings
of real regard for each other, imperiously
require that engagement to be dissolved. It
was made in folly: it would be consummated
in ruin. It would cheat both the contract-
ing parties of their future and their pros-
pects; it would afflict and confound the
families of each ; it could not be carried
out without impious perjury ; there was no

right, no competency, to enter on it, and
there would be grievous wrong and wicked-
ness in maintaining it. I now and here
declare that engagement dissolved, and I
demand of my nephew, Cuthbert, that he
honourably, and generously if you like, give
back her stolen promise to the lady."
“Never !” said Cuthbert, in a low, but
clear and ringing tone. “I am not satisfied
that it is a crime to love. I am not satisfied
that more is necessary to make a person
competent to become bound by a voluntary
promise, than just to understand the mean-
ing of that which is promised. Whoever
can be made answerable for a lie is com-
petent to tell truth. I repudiate your
authority, Uncle Marlowe, to declare an
engagement dissolved which was never made
to you. I did not seek for, and I am not
responsible for, this cruel scene—not cruel
to me, except indirectly, and because I can
feel for the distress which I witness ; but

most cruel to another. Beyond what I feel
thus, I am not embarrassed, I am not
ashamed, and, above all, I am not in any
sense dishonoured. Concealment is not
always a baseness : it may come from
childishness, as you have hinted; and it
may come from this—that one tells a plan
to those who will help it, Uncle Marlowe,
not to those who will oppose it. Conceal-
ment may also be a deference to another's
embarrassment. I never feared you, Uncle
Marlowe. I am sorry you are disappointed
in me, because I have felt your kindness
gratefully in sending me to Eton. But I

is taught there, since I have already seen
more reason to regret my ignorance of what
is not taught there. As to my prospects,
there was, at least, no mystery about them.

one day proud of her husband. From all

they have begun it. Look at that young
gentleman whose wretched character, Uncle
Marlowe, you only just now sketched !
Mr. George Childering is an heir, yet, I
fancy, you would back against his future
that of the prospectless brother, Mr. Alger-
non. Learning, I confess, I have not made
diligent progress in; but, of course, learning
is good only for the learned professions, and
not one of them would please me. I don't
want them. I wouldn't try them! There's

I have heard say, as any in the Church of
England—a first-rate man, in short, alto-
gether, and still you are not a bishop!”

It would not, however, answer to appear
discomfited ; his prestige or ascendant must
be saved.

“Boy!” said Cuthbert. “There lies your

argument the uncle of Cuthbert received
here a back fall, as it would be termed in
wrestling. A silence of a moment or two
ensued, during which two persons vainly
sought their words—Geoffrey to support,
and the doctor to crush, young Harding.
Before either of them spoke, a report of
firearms was heard in the stillness of the
conversational break. It seemed to be at
some distance from the cottage. A second
faint report followed almost immediately.
The sound would not have been heard had
the guests been speaking.
“Poachers, I suppose,” said Geoffrey, glad
of any interruption.
“Barely possible,” remarked Mr. Hard-
ing; "they might be looking up a hare
or so, but I have not much game in
my neighbourhood—and the season, you
know- "
“As likely some traveller,” said Mrs.
Harding, “who is attacked by those ma-

rauders of whom we have heard so much
lately. Ought we not to send in the
direction of the reports along the road ?”
“Whom are we to send? Old Hum-
phrey ? I'd go myself, but—-".
“And I,” said Geoffrey.
“ And I,” said Cuthbert.
“ If you go, Cuth, I'll go too,” said
Winny. “It will be such fun !”.
“Be quiet, child, or you shall be sent
to bed,” said Mrs. Harding. “Let us
listen!”
After a short pause, during which the
sound was not repeated, Mr. Harding, a
man who took most things as easily as
he could, observed :
"It is not worth while taking any
trouble. If it was those gentry, depend
on it, they would be far enough from
the place where the report was heard before
we got there."
“They might,” said Mrs. Harding, “but

not the poor person whom they have per-
haps shot.”
“Rich person, you mean,” retorted Mr.
Harding ; "poor persons are safe enough
from that kind of folk. But women are
so romantic! It is nothing at all. The
most that is shot is a hare.”
Here the doctor, who had collected his
ideas, observed :
“Well, you know best, William. But,
to return to a grave subject, and to finish
with it, have I your answer, Cuthbert ?”
“You have, uncle ! ”
“Then you compel me to take steps
which I had hoped to avoid.”
This was said in order to cover his
retreat with dignity. The doctor merely
shook a vague terror, in quitting the field,
over the head of the rebellious youth ; but,
in reality, he did not himself know what
those steps were which he announced him-
self as being compelled to take. He had

“paid with his guard,” and that guard
had been as entirely insufficient for the
end which he had intended to effect, as
Napoleon's was at Waterloo. Doctor Hard-
ing now regretted that he had necessitated
the presence of Emily and of Geoffrey at
this painful conflict. Cuthbert, on the other
hand, had felt at once that Miss Whitsund's
opinion of him, whether she willed it or
not, was at stake. His nerve, though
severely tried by so unexpected an ordeal-
(in which even the uncle's knowledge of the
promise exchanged between him and Emily
would have confounded most other lads,
without all those ferocious and withering
sarcasms against which he, unprepared, was
called on to defend and bear up their en-
gagement)-his nerve, I say, although most
severely tried, had never failed him. One
rankling and incurable wound he had got,
indeed, in the merciless onslaught; he was

told that she not only had no love for him,
but had given her love to another. And
this was tossed in his face before his Eton
friend, Mr. Geoffrey Mandeville, with whom
he had rashly expatiated on the attachment
which he had represented as uniting Emily
Whitsund and himself. But, at least, he
need not feel ashamed of his own bearing.
Geoffrey and Miss Whitsund had not seen
him either browbeaten or blustering. She
might have forgotten all, even the summer
strolls under the hawthorn hedge, but he
had not forgotten himself.
Having still, he conceived, his part to
play to the end, he determined to show
that he was not “snuffed out.” Assuming,
therefore, a look of composure, he turned
to his little sister, who had never deserted
his elbow.
“ Winny,” said he, “by-the-by, I have
a present for you from a young lady, who,

if ever you meet her, will put your nose
out of joint!"
“What does that mean?” asked Winny,
raising her hand involuntarily to the
threatened organ, so maligned in her for
its indentation.
“That she is far above you, Winny, in
point of appearance—that she is very
beautiful—what you will never be.”
“I don't care ?” cried poor Winny, toss-
ing her head mutinously. “But where is
the present? Show me!”
“Well, I left, as I dismounted, little Miss
Henrietta Mandeville's present to you on
the wall of the gateway leading into the
stable yard, and I forgot to take it up
again. It is a gigantic bouquet of mag-
nificent flowers.”
Winny darted away without a word.
During her absence, the conversation re-
verted to the subject of the shot which

had been heard, Mrs. Harding “confessing”
that she was not at all satisfied on that
head, when, suddenly, Winny burst again
into the room in a state of great excite-
ment.

“ What is the matter, child ?” cried Mrs.
Harding. “Why do you rush into a room
like that?”
“There's a gentleman in distress at the
gate, and he says he wants a shoe,” con-
tinued Winny, making big eyes, as the
French have it, and plucking off, uncon-
sciously, leaf after leaf of a splendid
bouquet.

A moment's silence testified the striking,
or, at least, enigmatical, character of this
announcement; the little party at table
exchanged glances of amusement. Geof-
frey laughed loudly and outright. Even
Emily Whitsund forgot the annoyance which
she had been made to suffer, and smiled.
“Why how many shoes has he ?” asked
Mr. Harding.
“Only three, he says,” cried she : “the
horse can't get on any more without the
other.”
“Oh! the horse! You said, the gentle-
I SE
man!”
Mr. Harding rose, quitted the room,
and, soon afterwards, returned, ushering
in a gentleman with thin, sharp, clean-
cut features, whom Geoffrey immediately
recognized as Mr. Melcombe. Cuthbert
remembered him as the person who had
vainly tried to back Sir Walter's argument
against Mr. Bradworth, by edging in a word

in favour of the principle at stake, and
who had been told that a deposit, and
not the principal, was required in the first
instance.
After the civilities of recognition and in-
troduction respectively,
“I ought to have been here two hours
ago,” said Mr. Melcombe; “but my horse
cast a shoe somewhere about Heron. Moss ;
I was obliged to dismount, and walk very
slowly. There is no forge near, is there ?"
“Not nearer than three miles," returned
the master of Lea Meadows ; “but the first
thing to-morrow morning——”
“Ah, thank you,” said Mr. Melcombe,
“That will not suit me. I have received
a telegraphic despatch which obliges me to
be in London the first thing to-morrow.
The mail train passes Throstledale at half-
past two this night, and I want to go up
by it to town. If I may trespass so far
on your kindness, Mr. Harding, will you

send back to Sir Walter's the horse which
has not brought me—and, in case you can-
not lend me another, I must walk to
Throstledale to-night.”
“As to that,” said Mr. Harding, “you
are welcome to my nag; but would you
venture ? Is it safe to travel the roads at
night, just now?”
“ Safe or not, I must go. There is a
Cabinet at one to-morrow, from which I
ought not to be absent. But I can testify
to the insecure state of the country from
personal experience this night.”
“Then you heard those shots ?”
“I was stopped by the first of them, and
I, myself, fired the second, not very far
from here. There were two men--only two,
I believe, and I don't think they intended
any unnecessary violence. Shortly after
the hack had fallen lame, I saw these
gentry, or their shadows, planted right
before me, at about a dozen yards. One

other, nothing but a bludgeon—so far as
I could discern. The man with the gun
called on me to stop and “shell out,'-

his piece. “I have still another barrel for
business,' he added; “that's just to make
you wise. And, to tell the truth, it was
clear, from the elevation of the weapon,
that he had not aimed at me."
“What did you do ?” said Dr. Harding.
“Well, I prepared to shell out,' as I
had been commanded,” replied Mr. Mel-
combe. “I don't know,” he added, with
a smile, “ that my shooting licence includes
the right to fire at two-footed, unwinged
game; but, since these recent outrages, I
have taken the liberty—(I say this among
friends, for it would not be very edifying
in a member of the Government to be cited
as a deliberate breaker of the law)—I have
taken the liberty of not going out at night

luck, carrying a revolver, one of the nipples
of which I want to get mended, you know.
So I said to my man who had not aimed
at me—'Let this go over your head, friend,
for your civility in firing high. It is but
the first bullet from a revolver, and I still
carry four men's lives in my hand; you
see I, too, can do some business, as you
call it.' They stood a moment whispering
together, and then the hero of the gun
burst out laughing, and declared that I was
see
'game.'”
Doctor Marlowe Harding, who never
omitted the opportunity of a pun, here ex-
claimed-
“Well, they had been making game of
you.”
“Very nearly,” pursued Mr. Melcombe.
“ I said, “thank you for your good opinion,'
and begged them to sheer off into the fields,
and to be sure that both of them took the

same side. This they did, to the left, and I
continued my journey as fast as I could get
the nag to walk, putting myself on the
other, or right, side of her.”
“ It is a mercy,” said Mr. Harding, “that
they did not try that new method of attack
which has come into vogue-stealing behind
you and garotting you before you know
where you are."
“It is so," answered Mr. Melcombe,“ but
that is more easily done in a large city,
where slight sounds do not attract your
attention, than in the country, where the
faintest rustle, the stir of a pebble under
the foot, the creaking of a branch in the
hedge, or any unexpected noise, makes a
man look round.”
“And pray, Mr. Melcombe,” said Mrs.
Harding, “after such an adventure, how
can you hazard a journey alone to the
Throstledale station, the very same night ?"
“The very same night!” he cried, gaily

_" that is just the thing: I have paid the
debt to Fate for this night, at all events.
It would be next to a miracle if I were
stopped again before morning. Such quick
iterations of the unusual don't happen to us,
or the idea unusual would lose its meaning.
You know what the French soldier says,
when a bullet in battle goes very near killing
him, but doesn't, and when it doesn't in the
slightest degree even hurt him—when it
rips up the saddle under him, or clips off

horse's coat?”
“What does he say?"
“That he is safe for that day, at least.
That destiny has called on him for its tax,

the statesman; “and I'll tell you what I

appear: each of us has his peculiar class of
liabilities, and enjoys a pretty constant im-
munity from other sorts. One man is always
in ill health ; another is always in ill luck
about pecuniary matters—he has only to
join a business speculation to smash it, you
don't know how. Another fares badly in
love ; another is tormented in his home,
although whatever he undertakes in external
business prospers. I was only the other day
saying to poor Stoneleigh, the late member
for the shire, “How wonderfully well you
invariably are, Stoneleigh — what high
spirits !’ ‘Yes,' said he, “when not in
positive torture ; you wouldn't envy me, if
you knew how strangely doomed I am to
dangerous mishaps. I am always meeting
with accidents! Out of the last four and
twenty years there aren't two which haven't
brought me a broken bone, a contusion of
the skull—in fact, something in that line.'
* Nonsense,' said I to Stoneleigh. “Never,'

replied he, solemnly, “get into a railway
train with me, if you can help it. I have
been in six collisions, and in nine other
accidents of different kinds. It seems as if
they expressly waited for me—were on the
look-out for me. Never get into a vessel
at sea with me. I have been only ten
voyages altogether, and seven of them ended
in shipwreck; the other three were very
angry and stormy. I enjoy amazing health
and spirits—but don't come yachting with
me. There's Sir Robert, now, wants me to
go yachting with him. I shouldn't wonder
if something happened-on my word, I
shouldn't.'
“That conversation,” continued Mr. Mel-
combe, “occurred between me and poor
Stoneleigh only just before he set out upon
the excursion to which he alluded; you
know the sequel ; he, poor fellow, his wife,
his two children, and even their lady's maid,
all gone ; the rest saved.”

“It was queer, was it not?”.
“ Nevertheless," said Mr. Harding, “if
you could put off your business in
town-m”
“Impossible, my dear sir !”
“Well, I'll order the horse for you ; and,
meanwhile, you can take a glass of wine ;
you'll oblige us, at least, with half an hour
of your society. After your encounter with
footpads and the fatigue of your walk, the
repose will do you no harm.”
Mr. Harding went out accordingly to give
directions, and the new comer, who had
taken his seat at the table, helped himself to
a glass of wine.
Cuthbert had never met a man of greater
influence or importance than Mr. Melcombe,
who was not only a Cabinet member of the
existing Government, but the most brilliant
orator belonging to it in the Lower House.
His speeches, indeed, had made his fame,
and the fame his position. He was con-

as
nected with the War Department, but was
outvoted in the Cabinet, he thinking that
the military organization of the country
required sweeping changes. Cuthbert's in-
stinct attracted him towards such persons.
He would be glad to oblige them.
“Since you are bent on going to Throstle-
dale to-night, Mr. Melcombe,” said he, “and
since you have yourself found the insecurity
of the way, perhaps a companion on the
road would be welcome. I should be de-
lighted to go with you. Those fellows
would not molest two, where they might
attack one."
“Many thanks for the offer, but I shan't
be attacked, I feel certain. I cannot imagine,
as I have said, that such a thing should
occur twice in the same night to the same
person. If I did need an escort,” he added,
smiling, “I could not wish for a more
courageous comrade. Sir Walter and I
were talking of you to a very remarkable

person, who came after you and Geoffrey
here had so abruptly departed; we thought
you would be just the one to lead a forlorn
hope.”
“I shouldn't like the army at all,” said
Cuthbert, “ as a profession.”
“Ah ! that is just it,” replied Mr. Mel-
combe. “I have influence enough at the
Horse Guards to procure a commission; but
I said to Sir Walter, who was hinting the
subject, that perhaps your father”—(Mr.
Harding had by this time returned, and was
listening to the conversation)—“or you
yourself might have other views. By-the-
by, I have a note for you, Mr. Harding, of
which Sir Walter did not wish to make
your son himself the bearer, and which he
would have sent over to you to-morrow, only
I said I should be passing here to-night. I
meant to have merely dropped it at the
gate in the hands of your servant; but my
horse had dropped something else first, this

lucky shoe, which has procured me the
pleasure of your acquaintance.”
He then handed the letter to Cuthbert's
father, who thanked him, and put it down
beside his own plate without opening it.
“ And may I ask," resumed Mr. Mel-
combe, perusing Cuthbert with that glance
which had so often read men, “why you
would dislike the army as a profession ?”
: “Well, for one thing, it is a rather poor
investment,” said Cuthbert, hesitatingly.
“Whew !” whistled Mr. Melcombe, in a
very low tone, and again looking at the
young man. “Money is certainly very
powerful. Probably, too, you would prefer
some of what may be termed the business
callings to any of the learned professions."
“Yes,” said Cuthbert.
“Well,” returned the other, “you may
command my good wishes and good word, if
any circumstances should arise in which you
think I can be of service.”

“ Thanks, Mr. Melcombe,” said Cuthbert.
“I shall remember your kind offer.”
Then, after a pause, he said:
“ Who is the remarkable person you say
arrived at the Park after Geoffrey and I
had quitted it? It seems a late hour for
any arrival.”
“Sir Walter may thank you, Mr. Cuth-
bert, for the late arrivals,” answered the
statesman. “Of three persons quite out of
the number who were to have met as
politicians, none but Mr. Bradworth—whose
views about certain railway schemes we
wished to hear—had been invited. But
Mr. Bradworth, it seems, had agreed to
receive the horse which he had bought of
Mr. Childering from that gentleman at the
town of Huntingferry, and to deliver it to
another at Mandeville Park. Mr. Brad-
worth himself could not have expected to
find the animal produced in the manner he
was, nor could Mr. Childering. This last

followed where you had led the way; a
letter and a messenger afterwards brought
Prince L—-, who is an old acquaintance of
Sir Walter's. A wonderful man that prince
-sure some day to play a great part !”
“That is not the general opinion, I
believe ?” observed Doctor Harding.
“Why, no,” said Mr. Melcombe ; “but
it is mine."
He now looked at his watch, and, being
informed by his host that the nag was
ready, he took his leave.
That he was not garotted that night
appeared from a brilliant speech which he
made, the next evening, in the House of
Commons.
Mrs. Harding, having retired with Miss
Whitsund, taking Winny, and wishing the
gentlemen good-night, Mr. Harding, with
an apology to Geoffrey, opened and read
Sir Walter Mandeville's letter, handing it
then in silence to his brother, the doctor.

Cuthbert felt that this letter referred to
him. The doctor made no comment on it,
but shortly afterwards said —
“A glass of wine, nephew. I spoke
harshly to you, but I spoke for your
good.”
Cuthbert bowed, and said to himself, as
he sipped his glass, “That letter, at the
least, makes much of me—perchance, offers
to do much for me.”
“Did I understand you rightly, that I
might hope for a short interview at seven
to-morrow morning, in the bridle path ?” he
had asked of Miss Whitsund, in a whisper,
before she retired.
Her answer, in the same low tone, had
been—
“I cannot meet you in that manner, but
I will write to you in a few days."
The gloom produced by this reply was
yet on his countenance, when-

“ Cuthbert,” whispered Geoffrey, “I won-
der you did not fling the decanter at the
doctor's head, upon his asking you to take
wine ? I feel as if I could still do it for
you—eh? But you're a trump, old fellow ;
you are, on my honour !”.
“Thanks, dear Geoffrey. He hit hard,
and cruelly, I grant.”
“ 'Tisn't what I call fair hitting, either,”
returned Geoffrey, “ but you stood it admir-
ably. Let that comfort you !”
“Not fair hitting," murmured Cuthbert,
abruptly ; “not fair hitting, you say. It
was stabbing, man!”
Geoffrey groaned audibly and clenched
his fists.
“Will you do me the favour, Mr. Geoffrey
Mandeville,” said, at this of all moments,
the deep, full voice of the divine, “ to take
a glass of wine with me?”
“Sir !” cried Geoffrey, his eyes blazing,

“See what a grace was seated on his brow:
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten or command ;

A combination, and a form, indeed,

CUTHBERT's room, in that eccentrically built
old cottage, was inside Geoffrey's. At an
early hour in the morning Geoffrey, who
was a light sleeper, was awakened by the
noise of a stealthy footstep, and, rubbing

his eyes, he saw his friend, fully dressed,
stealing across the apartment. Before he
could call, the figure had passed through
the door.
“It must be time to get up,” thought
Geoffrey; and he proceeded to do as he
thought.
When he had got down stairs, however,
he found nobody astir. Geoffrey was one
of those with whom time hangs very heavy
when alone, unless the body be vigorously
employed. He could not think of leaving
Lea Meadows without saying good-bye to
any one, or he would have been inclined
to have sought his horse and taken his
departure at once. But this would have
been neither courtesy nor good feeling, and
so he determined to stroll about the grounds
until he should guess it to be breakfast
time.
It has been said that the lawn was small,
and that it was skirted by the public road.

This road cut in two a plantation which, on
the one side, partly fringed the cottage, and
partly covered the flank of a rather steep
hill on the opposite side of the highway.
Through the plantation wound a footpath,
which began at a door leading from the
garden behind the house, continued its way
through the grove around the side, and
reached the road. There a little painted
wooden gate, always on the swing, corres-
ponded with another gate of the same kind
across the way, which second gate opened
on a prolongation of the footpath through
the plantation. The two little gates, thus
making mouths at each other, or rather at
the road between them, seemed to say, as
plainly as gates could, “notwithstanding
this intruder of a highway, we form only
one plantation and one footpath.”
Nevertheless, there was this difference be-
tween them, that the one nearer the cottage
was a strictly private way, while the other,

59
which took up business beyond the high
road, served pedestrians as a short cut over
the hill already mentioned, from a certain
point in that high road to the further of the
two little gates ; or again, from this last to
the point in question, as the case might be.
The road made, in and out, two miles round,
and the stile path only one mile across,
besides the pleasantness of the fields and
trees. Nobody, therefore, not belonging to
the cottage, was ever found in the hither
half of the plantation ; anybody might
chance to meet anybody in the other.
Geoffrey had got upon the road, and,
lounging forward, he neither knew nor
cared whither, was hesitating if he should
pursue the broader track, or accept the
more coy invitation of the byeway, and
enter the grove by the gate, when he heard
the branches rustle in the plantation, and
then a quick step upon the gravel.
In a moment afterwards, a young man,


## p. 60 (#68) ##############################################

HARDING
of most striking appearance, stood in the
road before Geoffrey. Notwithstanding a
certain carelessness in his dress, thick shoes,
and a jaunty, foreign-looking cap, somewhat
“rakishly stepped,” as sailors would say, it
was impossible to mistake him one instant
for anything but a born gentleman; and,
indeed, more. Much more, because to be a
gentleman born is not always to be a gentle-
man bred; nor to be this last, to look it.
But there could be no doubt about the youth
who now confronted Geoffrey, and this was
precisely our friend Geoffrey's first mental
conclusion. His second thought had been
—not the second, but the first of one or
two early damsels, bound kinewards with
their pails, whom the still earlier pedestrian
had passed near a few homesteads in his
rapid cross country ramble—it was this:
“well he is good looking, if you like.”
They were no ordinary good looks his.
A slight, slim, elastic figure—not tall, but

just a little above the middle height—suited
admirably the easy bearing and the springy
step. The eye was large, luminous, and
grey, but well shaded by the long lash and
the thick, smooth arch of the brow, both of
which gave a darker hue than the hair. He
had the head of a Greek god, or rather of
a youthful David; and the oblique light of
the climbing sun, which at that early hour,
burned golden through the top of the grove
behind him, would have helped the illusion,
for a ray came playing, like some nimbus,
into the wavy, yet close lying, auburn lock
which escaped from the stranger's cap where
he stood.
Although scarcely above the middle
height, as has been stated, the whole form
breathed strength, energy, and action, and
gave the impression of even a physical hardi-
hood far beyond what you would assign to
that deformed species of vigour which is
developed by certain handicrafts. The smith

has a brawny arm—yet the smith would
think twice ere lifting it against that slim
adversary. He seemed, with his fair, open
brow, not more than eighteen, but he was
just twenty-one.
The light of the morning sun was in
Geoffrey's eyes, and the stranger, therefore,
was beforehand with him, in point of recog-
nition.
“Why, Geoffrey,” said he, “you don't
seem to remember your friends. Who would
have thought of meeting you here."
“Oh! Mr. Algernon Childering !—it is
you, I declare.”
“No, it is not; it is not Mister. It is
your friend, Algernon. How is little Hen-
rietta ? Well, I see by your face. What
place is this, Geoffrey ? A pretty cottage !”
“Don't you know? This is Lea Meadows,
where the Hardings live.”
“Ah, indeed! I did not know. I am not

man. Mr. William doesn't come into
society.”
“Well, the clergyman himself is here
now, with that beautiful creature, his ward,
Miss Whitsund.”
“What! Emily here too 1” cried the
stranger, with a look of surprise.
“He calls her by her Christian name,”
thought Geoffrey. He then said aloud-
“Yes; if you'll wait, I'll ——”.
"No—many thanks—you see my rod.
I'm going to your father's ; I thought you
were there. I shall fish a little, lunch a
little, and then walk back.”
“ You won't have walked a little, at least.
Why, you must have risen early !”

again, bear hunting in Finland. So, having
been first burnt into me, and then frozen
into me, it is now duly tempered, tattooed
into the very fibres of my daily life. But,
Geoffrey, how do you happen to be
here ?"
“ Came with young Harding last night;
he was my chum at Eton.”
“And what brings Doctor Harding and
Em—- I mean, Miss Whitsund ?”
“You say you know him,” replied Geof-
frey ; “wait till breakfast, then, and I'll
introduce you to the brother.”
“No; I expect a letter from Dr. Harding.
I don't want to see Em—- I don't want to
see him till I get it. There is a reason; a
business matter. But, hark you, Geoffrey-
since you seem to know these parts, can you
tell me who and what is the maniac in the
plantation ?”
“A maniac in the plantation !”

“I think so," returned young Childering,
“ to judge from his wild gestures and in-
coherent language. As I crossed the stile at
the top of the hill, leading into the wood, I
heard a voice utter a horrible blasphemy:
Looking in the direction of the voice, I saw
a young fellow, his face half turned from
me; he was very pale, his hands were
clenched, his arms lifted horizontally before
him ; I should know him again ; but he did
not see me—and as I passed on quickly, I
heard him mutter to himself in a hissing
tone, as like snake talk as a human being's
can be--"
“Snake talk !” interrupted Geoffrey,
laughing boisterously.
“Yes,” resumed the other. “ Depend on
it, snakes think that we hiss, and that we
have no articulate language ; but after a
moment of this snake talk, as I tell you,
my youth comes out between his teeth with
something less incomprehensible to us

humans. It was good English, any way,
although not very good morals. “I'll have
his life !' quoth he.”
“Whose life ?" demanded Geoffrey,
shocked and in astonishment.
“Ah! that is the point. Not being a
wizard, can't say. But the words were
sufficiently remarkable to make me look well
at the individual : gentlemanly fellow, thin-
lipped, darkish, sallowish, handsomish ; light
grey frock coat, something like mine, only
cloth.”
“Why, that must be --” interrupted
Geoffrey, and then stopped short, staring
thoughtfully at Algernon.
“You were saying,” observed the latter-
“ yes—who ?”
And the stranger played negligently with
his rod, but fixed a keen eye on Geoffrey.
“Only that he's not mad, I can tell you,”
said the latter.
“Oh, very possibly,” returned Algernon ;

“mustn't judge always by appearances, you
know. But, in fine, who ?”
“Well, I should say, Cuthbert-young
Harding, that is.”
The stranger was buried in thought for a
moment, and then said
“ He used to be a playfellow of Em—– of
Miss Whitsund's, I believe, when both were
children?”
“Yes," said Geoffrey, “and—~"
Here he remembered in time that he had
no business to divulge his friend's secret.
He, accordingly, looked foolish, and stopped
short.
“Oh! there is the very individual,” said,
in a low tone, the stranger, averting his own
face, while drawing Geoffrey's attention to
a figure which, at that moment, appeared
slowly descending the pathway in the
wood.
On seeing a stranger with Geoffrey, the
figure halted, hesitated, and then deliberately

a mo-
turned into a transverse path which bisected
that leading from the little gate.
“That is Cuthbert,” said young Mande-
ville.
The stranger silently pursued, for a mo-
ment, the retreating figure with a glance of
interest. Then, after a few words of no
bearing on our story, Geoffrey said-
“Is that true about the affray with mid-
night marauders at Childering Hall—and
your gamekeeper's being wounded ?"
“Yes,” replied Algernon. “Poor Gilbert !
his recovery was despaired of at first, but he
is coming round (he did not add to whom
it was due that he was coming round).
Well, good morning, Geoffrey; I shall con-
tinue my stroll.”
“Good morning. I am glad of Gilbert's
recovery,” said Geoffrey. And Algernon,
shaking hands, walked swiftly along the
highway in front of the cottage, the living
image of youthful energy and beauty.

“Who was that you were speaking with?"
asked young Harding, when Geoffrey had
overtaken him in the plantation.
Geoffrey told him.
“I wish I had known,” said Cuthbert.
“You have told me so much about him, I
should have been curious to see him. A
sort of singing, painting, drawing-room fel-
low, I take it ! As little of classical know-
ledge, at least, as Uncle Marlowe finds in
W-
me.”
“Hum !” said Geoffrey.
“What does 'hum' mean? Don't be
oracular,” said Cuthbert.
“I was thinking,” returned the other,
good humouredly, “that your uncle, on the
contrary, gave him quite the other character,
last night, when he was telling me about
Oxford. Doctor Harding even made some
pun about him ; let me see—he called
Algernon the ripest scholar, of his years,
that he knew.”

“Why, that's no pun, good Geoffrey !
Probably, my uncle said, “of his age.' He's
fond of his pun, and of his glass, and of his
scold, and of his bishopric to be. Well,
this fellow is a scholar, then-be it so! One
of your bookworms, I suppose ; can't do
anything out of doors ; can't fence, can't

“Can't he, though ? " observed Geoffrey.
“Why, it was he broke that horse of his
father's, which you rode so gloriously from
Huntingferry. He asked his father to allow
him.”
“ Very ill he broke him then,” said Cuth-
bert. “But it must have been ticklish
riding to begin on him, I grant.”
“And I'll tell you what,” pursued
Geoffrey ; “ he's the very deuce, in spite of
his good looks, and fair face, is Algernon.

Algy called him out, and they weren't at it
for two minutes before Algy whipped the
rapier twenty feet high out of the French-
man's hand.”
“Do you know of whom you are speak-
ing thus to me?” said Cuthbert, with sud-
den fierceness. “I'll tell you, then, Geoffrey.
You are aware of the engagement between
Emily Whitsund and myself. Now, this
very person, this Algernon Childering, takes
advantage of my absence at Eton, and
worms himself into the affections of a girl
who has plighted her word to another. Do
you call that fair? And now all the aim of
both my uncle and the lady is to get me to
release her! You witnessed the shameful
scene of last night. It was not for such an
end, dear Geoffrey, I asked you to Lea
Meadows. Very different was the greeting

I had foolishly expected ! But," continued
he, with returned fierceness, “in the first
place, no release for this lady! In the
second place, they shall find yet that the
match they think so disadvantageous for
Miss Whitsund, will have that about it
which alone is really prized by nearly all I
meet, by the whole world. I feel already
differently towards this weak, this treacher-
ous girl. She shall not be set free to turn
me into derision; never! But I now see
what she is worth. Yet, to love her as I do,
and to hate her also—_".
He stopped, grinding his teeth ; and
Geoffrey was literally appalled by the ex-
pression which his countenance assumed.
“She would not even give me the private
interview which I demanded for this morn-
ing. No—she will write! Has she not given
him private interviews ? I'll have his life.”

Geoffrey, “as he came just now through

you meant, or whom you were speaking of.
Don't talk in this way. If you had his life
it wouldn't be worth so much to you as it is
to him. Besides, either the lady loves him
or she doesn't. If she does, she wouldn't
like you the better for killing him, you
know; and if she does not, you'd have
killed him for nothing.”
Young Harding appeared to be struck by
his friend's common sense.
“I was speaking at random,” replied he,
despondently; “I think I am haunted. It
is horrible ! ”
Geoffrey Mandeville felt dissatisfied with
this precipitate penitence.
Suddenly, young Harding, who had
seemed, for a few moments, much absorbed,
started slightly, and, turning to his friend,
asked, with a hesitating manner, and in a
faint voice-
“Did you laugh, Geoffrey ?”

“Not I,” replied young Mandeville ;
“but, now I think of it, Cuthbert, that is
not the first time you--you--".
He interrupted himself on observing his
companion's countenance, and inwardly
said—“ There is something very odd about
all this !”
Cuthbert reddened, and changed the whole
conversation, while Geoffrey mentally re-
solved that he would find some more wel-
come opportunity-some better mood,
humour, temper, of his friend—to question
him in the manner which curiosity (gradu-
ally awakened) was beginning to urge.
“I wonder,” said Algernon Childering to
himself, as he followed the windings of that
pretty country road between the fragrant
hedges—“I wonder why the doctor should
take her to make this visit, before he writes
to me? I could see that he approved of my
intended proposal, and I feel that she cares

obstacle to her accepting me be, except some
foolish engagement of her childhood, better
broken off beforehand ? And with whom
but with this same early companion, this
identical young Harding ? He seems, poor
fellow, to be in no very blissful mood. I
can feel for him. What could he have
meant by 'I will have his life?' Was it
my life?”

“ Then by—ehem !” cried that fiery and
reverend gentleman—"you had nearly made

“Emily,” said Cuthbert, “ do you wish to
be set free from your promise to me?”
The young girl seemed to suffer excruci-
ating mental distress ; but, after some hesi-
tation, she replied-
“It would not have occurred to my own
mind to ask this of you, Cuthbert; nor
should I fear, if wedded to you, that I could
not love you as a wife ought. Yet we are
not thus bound to each other now, and-

“You do not love me, you would say !”
exclaimed Cuthbert.
She evaded the harshest form of assent,
and answered
"I feel for you all the friendship and
and tenderness which one who has never
had sister or brother must feel for the com-
panion of her childhood, her earliest, her
dear, playfellow.”
“But you love another !” said Cuthbert.
“Surely your manner,” said she, with

dignity, "exceeds any right which the past
can give to Mr. Cuthbert Harding !”
“How can you possibly think so ?” ex-
claimed Cuthbert. “I am true and constant
to a promise from which you, less faithful,
appeal to my generosity to deliver you.
You—or, at least, my uncle--would have
me make a sacrifice of the most painful
kind to enable you to be happy! Suppose
I were to ask a more natural sacrifice at
your hands, in order that I may not be
wretched ? Is the question anything else
save this—whether I shall surrender a love
sanctioned by troth exchanged, or you a
love violating it ?”
“Cruel, cruel !” cried Miss Whitsund,
overwhelmed by that brief-speaking, power-
ful intellect, more fairly matched in mascu-
line conflict, than thus against a girl.
The doctor showed signs of wrathfully
coming to the rescue. But now, Cuthbert's

that weighty arguer.
“Let me say out, uncle,” he continued.
“You sent for me to hear me. Hear me,

none of my seeking. You have talked of
her not having known her own mind; I
believe it is at this moment that she does
not know it. I believe that you have first
ensnared, and then bewildered, her. I
believe that Emily is true at heart, and the
promise you demand I will hold steadfastly.
You have done all that mortal wit could
suggest to make me ashamed of this pro-
mise ; well, fix it deeply in your mind,

I was merely anxious to give you the oppor-

it away. You will find that we can do

Cuthbert made no reply. He rose, bowed
to the lady, gazed fixedly at the gentleman,
and left the rectory.
“Of course, my love," said the divine to
Emily, “had this foolish young man acted
properly, it would have been more satis-
factory to all parties. But it does not
matter. I am cut to the heart, my sweet
child” (he here seemed to be really moved)
“to have the ill chance of dragging you
through so many painful scenes.”
Her tears fell fast.
“ Courage !” he continued, after a pause.
“All this is over. You have received a
proposal which, in every point of view, has
my sanction. You will, of course, accept

“And the engagement ?” faltered she.
“ Is worth nothing. It was beyond your

“No! he feels what I feel.”

“No, not Cuthbert; Algernon.”

The doctor glanced over as impassioned
an offer of the heart and hand as ever youth
addressed to beauty and to goodness ; but,
to his ineffable surprise, found that it ended
in these words :-
“If I write to you, not without hope, I
write in great terror, also. Something has

much happiness to hope that your heart,

exists, I have no right to explanations ; tor-
ture not your pity to give them. Should

“Good heavens!” exclaimed the doctor ;

She said nothing, but slowly and languidly
retired.

to Lea Meadows. “Well, be it so. She is
not my first, nor my primary, object in life.

at pleasure. And first, for this Mr. Per-
fection.”
He had hardly uttered the words, when

the colour left his countenance. He looked
back; he looked on every side of him; and,
in order to do so more effectually, he pulled
up his horse, which stood stock still, its skin
shivering, every now and then, with a
sudden and violent shudder.
The beautiful, peace-breathing English
landscape lay around, hushed in perfect
repose. No human figure was visible.
"Am I deranged ?” muttered the rider-
"or, gracious Heavens ! is it truly and really
an external thing which lurks at hand-
which attends me—which follows me—
which can hear what I say—nay, can hear

Drops of sweat stood on his forehead.
When he reached home, he hastened to
his own room, and, locking himself in,
placed pen, ink, and note paper before him.

on
It was evening. An elderly and a young
man were seated in the bow window of the
dining-room at Childering Hall. The elder
seemed all spirits, like youth ; the younger
as spirit-broken as age. The elder was the
father of Algernon Childering. But who
was the younger ? Not Algernon, surely ;
not Algernon, glittering with intellect, and
gay with the sanguine consciousness of
victorious powers ; not Algernon, whose
buoyant air was but the impress of the
buoyant mind, overflowing with hope, bril-
liant of look, brilliant of word.

“Algernon,” said the elder, “it is not the
cheers you raised at the time, but the lasting
impression you have left, which most de-
lights me. See l here are heaps of letters,
all singing the same song—all congratulating
me about you—all filled with your praises.
You are cut out for public life. I'll answer
for your career.”
A pause, and a low, fluttering, nearly
imperceptible little sigh, from the young
man.
“Yes," resumed the elder ; “it is almost
an unprecedented course for a father to beg
the constituents who have returned him to
four parliaments in succession—and who
would still return him to a fifth—to transfer
their confidence, not to his eldest son, but to
the younger. Yet, if the eldest abjure
public life—if he be totally unfit for it—if
he be the shame, instead of the pride, of all
who belong to him—ah! Algy, you have
consoled me for him. Never an act or word

from you that gave me grief! But this
success, I say, Algy, this success—I cannot
get it out of my head. Much as I expected
of you, you've exceeded my fondest hopes.
Work, and the love of work are in you, my
dear boy; no hollow make-believe, no sham ;
no silly presumption that anything worth a
straw can be effected without hard striving.
What Frenchman was it that said, “patience
was genius ?' You took that very sentiment
to your little heart when you were not that
high. Stick to it. It will carry you far.
Here come the economists nowadays, and
inform us that wealth is labour; that every-
thing of value represents labour. It is no
discovery ; it is as old as the expulsion from
Paradise.”
He paused suddenly, and changed both
his theme and his tone.
“Come, show a brave heart, Algernon.
You are knocked down by suspense. You
don't listen to me. Be brave, be yourself !

The lady will accept you ; I'm sure she will.
I want to divert your mind.”
“ Yes,” said Algernon, “ I am diverted—
I am grateful—I am attending to you. I
am not thinking of the answer to my pro-
posal. There is the messenger !” added he,
with a start, and becoming white as a
sheet.
“ Come in,” said the father, and a servant
entered with two letters on a little silver
tray. Both were addressed to Algernon.
One was in a strange hand. The hand of
the other he knew well. He tore open the
last. It contained these words—
“She who declines, but not ungratefully
nor willingly, an offer which does her real
and very great honour, can appreciate to
the full your thousand admirable qualities--
your lofty and generous spirit, and your
truly noble heart.

non's father read Algernon. Both knew the
contents of the communication—the purport
of the lady's answer—equally soon.
The young man drooped his head on his
chest, and leant back in the chair. The
hand which held the letter hung listlessly
by his side. Mr. Childering took the brief
note, and read it with a sigh. A long silence
ensued.
“Well, well,” said the father, at last, “ if
so, it must be even so ; you must not hang
your head. I, too, feel this, my dear son.
Rouse yourself. Is my sympathy nothing
to you? What I are you to be thus van-
quished by an event which happens every
day under far more cruel circumstances ?
And now, listen, weigh well what I say to
you. I would not oppose your union with
Miss Whitsund; but still—hang it! I can-

Algernon started and wrung heartily the
proffered palm, but said nothing.
“Grief will have its way,” continued the
father, “and a sudden blighting of fond
hopes is like the tooth of a serpent. But
hark you, Algy, are you attending to me?”
“Yes, father,” replied the youth, with an
effort.
“That is right; shake off the first crush-
ing weight. Nearly everything depends on
the beginning. Beginnings are very mighty
things, Algy, both for ill and for good ; there
is nothing so important as the beginning of
anything, except the ending. Come ! listen
to me; in all these cases, a great deal
depends on one's own self; otherwise, how
is it that one person bears up, and another
sinks, under the very same stroke ?”
“Yes,” said Algernon, inappropriately,
but with a gallant attempt to recover him-
self, and to listen to his father ; “yes; one
sinks.”

"I will,” said poor Algy, looking up very
pale, while his mouth twitched, and two big
tears stood in his eyes. He tried hard to
smile, but it would not serve—he covered
his face with his hands.
Mr. Childering respected the young
anguish, and for many minutes watched in
silence an interior struggle which he could
not assuage. He poured out a glass of wine
for himself and another for his son, neither
tasting the first, however, nor proffering the
second. But when the sudden paroxysm of
disappointed hope was a little relieved by

Mr. Childering, seeking anything to turn
his son's thoughts, remarked
“But see! Here is still another letter
for you !"
The mental oppression which a father's
tenderness could not chase away, was des-
tined to be quickly dispelled by a stranger's
rage and malice.
“From whom can this be ?” said Alger-
non, sighing heavily. When he took up the
letter, it was evident his thoughts were far
from it. Without opening it, he said —
“I told you what I dreaded before I ven-
tured on this offer. She already had an
attachment, and she preferred this young

“Never give names to the day till the sun
is down,” replied Mr. Childering. “Yours
will be a long and bright day yet, my lad.
Meanwhile, just read your letter."
“Private,” said Algernon, breaking the
seal.
His first glance was to the signature,
which made him start, and presently, as he
read the contents, the red blood mantled
once again, warm and strong, in the cheeks
it had deserted.
“Be that letter from friend or enemy,"
cried the delighted father, “it has served
your turn, Algy! Do you know you didn't
look a bit like yourself just now !”
“No very warm friend, apparently,” re-
plied Algernon ; “ private ’ is on this pre-
cious document, or I would show it to you."
“Give the writer my compliments and
thanks, whoever he is !” again exclaimed
the father, more and more enraptured ; “he
beats me hollow in the art of consoling

a high-spirited young gentleman under his
first great heart-grief.”
“No secret of mine, sir, I assure you.”
“Don't mention it, my dear boy !” almost
shouted Mr. Childering. “I don't care a
filbert what it is ; it has proved a specific in
your case. Providence ordered that you
should get that letter in the nick of time."
“ Providence orders all things,” replied
Algernon, “except the use men make of
their will, and then Providence orders the
consequences of even that. My present cor-
respondent seems to have a will of his own,
one of those wills from which very strange
consequences sometimes come.”
At this moment, the servant knocked (he
knocked instead of entering at once, because
Mr. Childering, expecting Miss Whitsund's
reply to his son's offer, had given orders
that they were not to be disturbed after
dinner). The servant being told to come in,
said-

“I beg pardon, sir; but I thought you
would be angry if I did not tell you.”
“What is the matter, Jones ?” asked Mr.
Childering
“Poor Gilbert, the gamekeeper's boy is
just come running to the hall, sir !”.
“Is Gilbert dead ?” cried Algernon, start-
ing to his feet, full of solicitous animation,
and so haggard all at once for another's
trials that he had evidently forgotten his
own.
“No, sir; he's not dead.”
“ Is he worse, then?”
“No, sir; he's not worse.”
“ Thank God! Poor Gilbert ! I fired my
first shot under his tuition. But what,
then, is the matter ? you've given me a
fright.”
“Ay, Algy, and me, too,” said the father ;
“you're hard to frighten,” he added, in a
low tone, to himself, “ except in that way.
All your frights are about other people.”

The son was not attending to, and did not
hear, his father's muttered remark.
“ I'm sorry I startled you, sir,” resumed
the servant; “ but Gilbert's boy says that
Gilbert thinks that, perhaps, you might be
strolling down in his direction this evening,
e
sir."
“Why, it was precisely for that purpose
we ordered dinner so early,” replied the
young gentleman. “Tell Gilbert's boy that
I shall certainly call this evening, and shall
be there almost as soon as the lad, unless he
runs. How is the wound now? I haven't
seen the poor fellow these three days."
“It is a little uneasy, sir, the lad says.”.
“Is the wine out that we sent?” asked
Mr. Childering, senior.
“No, sir ; the boy says it isn't half drunk
yet.”
“Because," observed Algernon, “Gilbert
is to be kept well supplied with good port.
The doctor said so."

“ You can go now, Jones,” said Mr. Chil-

The servant retired, and closed the door.
“ Tell Gilbert, Algy, that I'd have come
with you myself to-night, only I have busi-
ness, as you are well aware.”
“Yes, I know-letters—this electioneer-
ing project about me.”
“And, Algy, I shall have finished the
letters by the time you return, and I'll wait
for you. This early dinner permits a little
supper. We'll have it in the library. Don't
be later than eleven ; I want to have a chat
with you."
“ Eleven! Oh! I promise you I shall
return before then, since you are good
enough to say you'll wait for me. You
know I'm always punctual.”
“Your head is a chronometer, Algy. See !
you've dropped your letter. 'Twouldn't do

CHAPTER VI.
“But where is he, the pilgrim of my son ?
Methinks he cometh late, and tarries long."
Childe Harold.
ALGERNON, having run downstairs from his
room (where he had exchanged his boots for
a pair of stout walking-shoes), was putting
on his hat and was selecting a stick from a
whole armoury of such articles, stuck in the
large ten-ringed stand which occupied a
corner of the spacious entrance hall—when
the servant, Jones, hurried towards him,
and said,
“Beg pardon, sir ; I forgot to mention
that the person who brought the letter is
waiting. Is there any answer ?”

“What letter? Oh, the other letter !”
said Algernon, looking up, after having
pleased himself about the stick; "yes, to
be sure ! 'Messenger to wait,' was on the
envelope. I had forgotten all about it-my
fault, Jones. Let the man wait, and I'll
give you an answer for him in a second.”
And he walked quickly into the library
(a room on the ground-floor, off the hall),
where he found his father seated at the solid,
colossal, old oaken-table, already busy-
spectacles on—with his letters.
“Excuse me one moment, father," said
Algernon, sitting down at a corner of this
table, and drawing towards him some note
paper ; “I must just answer that other
letter. I shall not be long."
“As long as you like, lad; you don't
disturb me," said Mr. Childering.
Algernon read once more, and very atten-
tively, the communication to which he was
about to reply.

It so happens that I have the communica-
tion in question before me at this moment--
the original, I mean, of Cuthbert Harding's
letter to Algernon Childering ; but, for
reasons connected with Cuthbert's family,
I am unwilling to give it textually.
This, however, is no matter—for it does
not affect the incidents of my narrative to
know either the whole purport, or the exact
terms of the letter; it is enough to mention
that it was a bitterly and powerfully phrased
affront, and that, among other things, it
concluded with a passage to this effect: that
the writer was aware of the prejudice (so
he called it) which had arisen against duel-
ling, and that Mr. Childering, junior, could
if he chose, shelter himself behind that pre-
judice, but if he had one faint remnant of
manly feeling (and more to that effect),
he would, it was hoped, meet the writer
at what time, place, and weapons, might
suit his, Mr. Algernon's, pleasure; only,

as to time, the better speed, the better
courtesy.
When Algernon had gone through that
polite production a second time, as has been
said, he tore it up, took a pen, and wrote
these words :-
“I do not know any foolish thing so
wicked as that which you propose, nor any
wicked thing so foolish.
“I therefore decline it.
“Don't let this, however, depress your
spirits, because (take my word of honour
on it), for me to meet you as you demand
would be to murder you !
“ ALGERNON CHILDERING.”
Folding, sealing, and directing this note,
he went into the hall, and told the servant to
give it to the messenger.
He was then going out, when his father,
opening the library door, once more cried
after him,

.“ Till eleven, Algy!”.
“Without fail, at eleven," replied the
young man.
It was half-past ten o'clock (and a misty,
moonless, windy night out of doors) when
Jones entered the library, where Mr. Chil-
dering was still hard at work with his
letters.
Jones was not a butler; he was more
than a butler.
“Shall I disturb you, sir,” said the ser-
vant, “if I lay the cloth now for supper ?”
“No-there, I have done,” replied the
master. “What o'clock is it?” added he,
drawing out his watch.
The bronze timepiece on the chimney
shelf rang out the half-hour.
“Right to a second ! How time flies !”
He put up his watch as he spoke, and
began to pace the floor, with his hands
-behind him.

“What table would you like, sir ?" asked
Jones.
“That round one near the fireplace,” said
Mr. Childering; “and—it is not exactly cold,
but, for July, 'tisn't warm—just light me the
look of a fire—the name of a fire, Jones.”
“Yes, sir. I can tell you, it's a damp,
foggy night outside, sir, and Mr. Algernon
will perhaps like a little fire when he comes
in.”
"Just so,” said Mr. Childering (he was a
man who spoke more to his servants than do
many of his class, and servants' faces never
changed at Childering Hall; Jones, too, was
a confidential, attached, old servant) “just
so, Jones. Mr. Algernon will like it. He'll
be here precisely at eleven,” added the father,
with a kind of vanity: “when my boy says
a thing, he does a thing; a chronometer of a
head! You always found that, didn't you,
Jones, when you travelled with Mr. Al-
gernon?”

“ Always, sir, except nature itself was
counter, like when we had the fever in
Andalusia ; then we were light a bit in the
head at times, and forgot things.”
We had not suffered the said fever ;
Algernon had had it all to himself, but
that was Jones's style. When travelling
with his young master, he would talk of
“our hotel ;” he would say, “a letter for
us, master Algy,” or “our letters have gone,
sir ;” and when, after a long and venture-
filled course through Europe, and beyond
it, they, at last, came back to the old hall
in Warwickshire, he pointed out the fact
the first, with “That's the Hall, sir ; I can
just see our tree tops yonder.”
Jones had pushed up the pendant lamp
which hung directly over the great library
table, had laid the other table, had lit the
fire, and had placed two chairs, when the
timepiece struck the three quarters.

Childering; and he turned the armchair,
usually facing the library table, so as to
make it face the fire. He then took a
volume of Scott, and sat down to pass the
remaining quarter of an hour in its perusal.
He had lost all thought of place and hour
when tinkle rang forth the timepiece, and
told him it was eleven by the night. Me-
chanically he pulled out his watch, and, for
the second time that evening, exclaimed-
.“ How time flies ! ”
He put a mark in his volume, and
threw it on the large table. The door
opened.
“Shall I serve, sir ?” said Jones, “or
shall we wait a minute or two, till Mr.
Algernon comes in ? ”
“Well,” said Mr. Childering, “ we'll just
wait a few minutes, say five. You see, my
son's watch may not be set with ours. I
think we are fast."
Jones made a respectful little bow as he

silently closed the door. Mr. Childering
again took up Scott, and again Scott
charmed him out of all consciousness of
place and hour. Yet the timepiece con-
tinued all the same to chop time up into
little bits, and to fling them, as though with
the click of scissors, down, down, down into
an irrecoverable gulph, “the past eternity.”
Fast and unnoticed fell the seconds, each
lopped off with its little click, falling deep
and far, never more to rise—never, never
more; and still Mr. Childering sat reading,
absorbed, unconscious. He did not hear the
door open ; but he started when he heard
the voice of the servant and that of the
timepiece simultaneously announcing half-
past eleven.
Now, for the first time, a slight, vague,
scarcely discernible shade passed over the
old man's countenance, as he closed his book
(putting the marker in it, however), and laid
it down.

“Half-past, and my son not returned !
Rather odd, Jones, eh ?”
“Half an hour is not very much, sir,”
suggested Jones, in a tone of voice more
cheery than his looks.
“Now, I think it is much,” replied Mr.
Childering; “much for Mr. Algernon.
Punctuality itself; a head like a chro-
nom-- Good heavens !” burst out the
old man—“ if anything should have hap-
pened to him !”.
“May heaven forbid, sir !” said the
servant.
“But he said, ' without fail,' Jones ; you
remember that. Without fail, at eleven,'
said he ! Those were his last words in
going out. And when he says that — ”
The master and the servant stared at
each other. Click, click, went on the time-
piece.
Jones's face suddenly brightened.
“I'll tell you what it is, sir! Mr.

Algernon has, likely, found poor Gilbert
worse than he thought, and couldn't leave
the cottage while Gilbert was bad.”
“Ah! there is something in that,” said
Mr. Childering ; “I hope it is no more, and
that he has found poor Gilbert very—~"
Then, shocked at the inhuman speech,
which had nearly slipped from him un-
awares, he reddened.
“Heaven forgive me !" continued he ;
“I don't know what I am saying. I'd be
very sorry that Gilbert was worse. We'll
give Mr. Algernon a quarter of an hour
more, and, if he is not returned then, send
some one down to Gilbert's to ascertain
whether he is there, or when he left.”
“Thomas shall go, sir, precisely at a
quarter to twelve, if by that time Mr.
Algernon be not come back himself.”
The servant withdrew, and Mr. Childering
betook himself once more to his book. It
no longer charmed his thoughts, nor even

hall door bell; he muttered to himself fifty
times over, “Very odd, can't understand
it!”
Half-past eleven! No Algernon.
Three quarters ! No Algernon.
“Send Thomas at once down to Gil-
bert's !” cried Mr. Childering, as the servant
answered an impatient summons of the bell.
“He is gone, sir, these five minutes,”
replied Jones, and then added reluctantly:
“ for the timepiece is slow, sir.”
Mr. Childering, when again left alone,
found that he could not rest for a moment
in one position or in one place ; he thought
of taking his hat, and sallying forth himself.
But he might thus only miss Thomas, and
delay, instead of hastening, the receipt of
the news which he dreaded and desired.
But, besides, Algernon himself might come
back while he was away ; Algernon surely
might still come at any moment. So

instead of the exclamation, “How time

as he consulted his watch, “How time
creeps !”
Twelve o'clock ! No Algernon. No
sound, save the click, click. Mr. Childering
left the library; a gust of wind met him
in the hall; the hall door was open; some-
body was standing outside, with a hand
stretched back, holding the door.
“Oh! it is you, Jones. What can detain
that man Thomas ?”
It was useless standing there. They
retired. Mr. Childering re-entered the
library. Half an hour afterwards, they
again met each other, in the same manner,
at the ball door.
“He'll be here, sir, in a few minutes
now ; Thomas will."
The few minutes seemed hours. One
o'clock. A quarter past. At last, just as

Mr. Childering was again about to quit the
library, he heard the hall door bell violently
pulled, and immediately afterwards the rapid
tread of feet in the hall, and the murmur of
two men's voices.
He went out, and in the faces of Jones
and Thomas he read anxiety and terror.
“Well, Thomas, you have been to
Gilbert's ?”
“Yes, sir ; but they was asleep in the
cottage.”
“ Asleep! Good heavens! Go on.”

looked out of the upper window—_"
“Well, well—and my son ?”

left; we will meet in the hollow near the
Throstledale Road.”
It was done accordingly. Neither of the

he had appointed for the meeting with
Jones, he observed the latter, who had
arrived before him, anxiously examining a

covered with mud, as though it had been
trodden under foot.
“Where did you find this ?”
“Why, out upon the road yonder, sir.
I thought I would just cross the wall in
this part, as I noticed deep footprints lead-
ing to it. I'm minded, sir "
But Jones arrested his own words, panic
stricken.
“Well—what? Why did you stop like
that? What have you seen ?”
“Why, it looks on the road as if there
had been a struggle like, sir.”
“A struggle! Alas !”
The old man said no more, but hurriedly
passed the low park wall, followed by the
servants bearing lanterns, with the light of
which they swept the road.
Certainly, and a desperate struggle, too.

after the late rain, was, within a compass
of a few yards, ploughed with footmarks ;
here and there they had evidently slipped.
It seemed as if five or six persons had been
engaged in deadly conflict. A pool of blood
shone dark red in the very middle of the
road.
Tracking the footsteps a little way, they
were wholly lost upon the harder rising
ground, and here all further search became
vain. It was perforce abandoned.
Slowly and silently the whole party, no
longer divided in hope, but united in des-
pair, returned through the pleasant glades
of the park to the old Hall.
Mr. Childering had dropped his hat in
stooping over the ominous traces : it had
been wetted. Jones picked it up and re-
stored it to its master, who took it absently,
and so continued to hold it. He never put
it on his head, and his grizzled locks blew
neglected about his temples in the night

wind. During the return he uttered not
one word, but looked about him in a wild,
haggard, wistful manner. At length, his
poor old head drooped fairly on his chest ;
and thus he marched, the servants hanging
respectfully behind—Jones a little nearer
than the rest, almost, indeed, at his master's
elbow, with eyes never once removed from
him, but mute and perplexed.
They had entered a dark shrubbery, which
conducted to the open, rising, gravelled
space before the hall door. That space sur-
rounded, as a bay surrounds a landing pier,
a lofty flight of stone steps, stone balustered.
Here the moon shone down upon an island,
as it were, of silvery light, amidst seas of
verdant shadows.
Mr. Childering was emerging from the
shrubbery upon this illumined spot, when he
uttered a tremendous shout.
There, on the perron, or flight of stone
steps, bareheaded, his fair locks, beaming

dubiously in the imperfect light, his brave
young front erect, his slight figure well
defined, as he leant listeningly forward,
stood an apparition which made the old
gentleman's blood bound in his veins.
“Why, Algernon,” shouted Mr. Childer-
ing, “is that you ?”
They were together in a moment.
“ What has happened? Are you hurt ?”
“Not hurt in the least.”
“And the delay ?—and your cap ?”
“My cap is my only loss. The delay
I will explain. Come in, and I will tell
you all.”
There he was mistaken. He could relate
only his own part of the transaction. So
far as our story is concerned, he could tell
something, but not all. For that reason,
the narrative must be pursued in another
way, and the reader must be informed of
several matters besides those which Algernon
could tell his father.

THE events of that day, it seems, were not

for one moment to notice a curious circum-
stance, of which everybody is vaguely con-
scious, and to which people generally allude,
nevertheless, as to some idle fancy. There
are days in the lives of all of us which we
find peculiarly eventful, and call so; and
there are long successions of days, the events
of which, if added together, would fall short
of the sum thus suddenly furnished at iso-
lated and, apparently, capricious dates. This

remark is so familiar, and so abundantly
indorsed by everybody's experience, that
it would not be worth while to make it, ex-
cept to introduce another, which is, that not
only a certain day in thirty, or in a hundred,
or in three hundred, is more full of inci-
dent than all the others put together, but,
what is less intelligible, we shall find, not
misfortunes merely, as Shakspeare says, but
the whole of the events which love to crowd,
after this fashion, in company, to be almost
invariably of a family, and to have their
names down under one generic term in the
great book of Fate, as being kinsfolk to the
bone. It is not, I repeat, good fortune and
disaster alone which can lay claim to this
progeny of gregarious incidents.
Nothing is trivial; and, in trying to guess
what will prove the least so, we are per-
petually duped. Of all the hopelessly

occurrences, is the most habitually and the
most largely dotted with our mistakes ; we
sow them broadcast, and with both hands,

elapse, and whoever comes that way in

The fraction of an inch in the depth of a
man's neckcloth may affect the sit of his
head as he walks through the streets that
day ; and this may incline him to keep his
chin in the air, as people say, or just the
reverse ; and he may happen to see some
person, or not to see him, and seeing that
person, or not seeing him, makes a dif-

his life.

not so. Events are flung so true, look you,
and come whizzing so unerringly, from the
Invisible Hand, that they not only hit us
where we are, but would not hit us save
where we are, save as we are. Held you but

coming and the going of misfortunes. Small,

also in flights, like the migratory birds.

It was thus with the day at which we

any incidents except those which defy record
having passed within the minds of the
various persons concerned, Doctor Marlowe
Harding sent for his nephew, and then a

little series of occurrences began which had
not yet terminated, when Mr. Childering sat
down to read his book, and to wait for
Algernon's return, in the library at Child-
ering Hall. The interview between Cuth-
bert and Miss Whitsund, that morning, in
Doctor Harding's presence, has been related.
Three letters were, in consequence of that
interview, written on the same day. The
reader has seen the arrival of the two first
at their destination, and the writing of the
third. The arrival of this last is now waited
for. Both Miss Whitsund and Cuthbert
addressed the same individual. The latter
answered his enemy; to his friend he had
nothing to say. If Cuthbert had been in-
formed that Miss Whitsund was also, that
afternoon, sending a note to Algernon Child-
ering, Cuthbert would have deepened still
further (cut though it was as with a chisel
in stone) the trenchant sternness of his pro-
vocation. And again, if Cuthbert had

known what Miss Whitsund's letter to
Algernon contained, Cuthbert might have
suppressed his own altogether.
But it was gone, and he had to await
the answer.
The distance between Childering Hall and
Lea Meadows was six miles ; his messenger
had gone on foot; therefore, he had four
hours, at least, to wait before the reply
could come. But this was on the supposi-
tion, that the boy who had been sent with
his note should find Mr. Algernon Childer-
ing at home, and should be at once fur-
nished with a note in return. It was
probable, Cuthbert calculated, that the
young gentleman would be at the Hall,
for now it was four o'clock. He would
have returned from any morning excursion
to dress for dinner about six. How he
would deal with the letter, and whether
he would require a little time to consider
that point, were other questions. Cuthbert

threw in an additional hour for small con-
tingencies, and fixed nine o'clock as the
probable time of his messenger's return.
Now it so chanced, that in a newspaper
which had come from London that morning,
he had, after inditing and despatching his
challenge, seen a reference to the proposed
line of railway in which, by Mr. Bradworth's
special favour, he had invested the whole of
his winnings upon the recent races. Affairs
seemed to have advanced with a swifter
stride, and to have ripened with an earlier
development, than Mr. Bradworth had pro-
mised; for that high authority had men-
tioned a fortnight as the period after which
the shares in the line would be at a pre-
mium. Cuthbert, on reading the paragraph
in question, concluded that he had not a
moment to spare, if the first good oppor-
tunity for “realizing” were to find him
prepared. He, therefore, had scarcely des-
patched his note to Algernon Childering,

when he again sat down and wrote a letter
to Thomas Falconer, Esq., Lincoln's Inn,
London, begging that gentleman to do him
the service of finding for him some broker,
to whom he might entrust the sale of certain
shares. The reader will perhaps remember
this Falconer ; Cuthbert had alluded to him
as “poor Tom Falconer,” who had so soon
found his level at Hazlebury; this allusion
was when Geoffrey was pressing Cuthbert
to go to Mandeville Park. Afterwards,
again, while alone in the exquisite little
bath room of that mansion, Cuthbert's
thoughts had reverted to the same subject,
and the same practical warning. Falconer
had been an ancient of young Harding's ;
had preceded him a few years in life ; was
at Eton with him ; had been in it, and was
out of it, before him; and had now settled
down to the bar. How untrue the ex-
pression! Mr. Thomas Falconer had risen
up rather, and, with girded loins, had begun

to fight hard in life — had thrown his
entire energies into the profession which he
thought would, of all professions, do most
justice to his scholarship, his trained abili-
ties, his honest love of work.
Apologising for the intrusion on his old
friend's time, and referring to the impossi-
bility under which he lay of himself seeking
out a broker-absent as he was from Lon-
don, and ignorant of it-Cuthbert made a
brief little allusion to their school friend-
ship, hoped Falconer liked his profession,
and expressed a wish to have news from
him. “The march of a friend on a larger
career,” wrote Cuthbert, “will interest me
deeply in the stagnation of this country
existence.”
Why, it had not been much more than
a week old, that “ country existence ;” and
it had not quite stagnated with Cuthbert.
What! the start which the messenger of
death had gained on him, and then the

daring ride from Huntingferry; the preser-
vation of a great lady's life ; the conquest
of a powerful family's perpetual gratitude ;
the spring with which he had planted at
once and for ever his audacious young foot
on a higher platform of the social scale ; the
subsequent intellectual duel à mort, that
desperate, gladiatorial conflict, in which he
had tested the triply tempered steel of his
nerves, not to say his wit, words, and mind,
against his celebrated uncle, for a stake so
vital; the interview of that morning with
the girl whom he passionately admired, and
whom, in his heart, he bitterly reproached
for her supposed inconstancy; all this, and
the antagonism he had unexpectedly encoun-
tered in the youth whom he so furiously
styled, when communing with himself, “that
Mr. Perfection ;” with the strange defiance
which he had only just written, and to
which he was expecting, on that very
evening, such an answer as might lead to

a rather speedy and decisive settlement of
all his projects ; these things happened in
one week! And he could write about “the
stagnation of this country existence ! ”
Well, the words would sound full of veri-
similitude ; they were prescriptive words ;

town.
Cuthbert had finished his letter, when
it suddenly occurred to him that it would
not be delivered till the evening of the
next day. It could not lead to any action
on a broker's part till the day after that ;
and, where property so variable as “shares”
was concerned, a day might be important.
Cuthbert, therefore (while purposing to
post his letter all the same), determined that
he would go to Throstledale hiinself early in
the morning, and send a telegraphic message
to his friend Falconer. Throstledale was the
nearest telegraphic, although not the nearest

railway station; and Throstledale was in
the same direction as Childering Hall, only
further by four miles. There was a good
inn close to the railway, and Cuthbert would
have started at once to walk the ten miles
(he could not take the pony which he had
sufficiently tired in his ride that morning,
to and from the rectory of Panes cum Pis-
cibus); he would have started, at once, I
say, to walk the ten miles, only that he felt
chained by curiosity and passion to the
place which he had given as his address,
until Algernon's answer should arrive. “I
will go to bed early,” he thought, “and get
ap at four o'clock !” But he was to realize
a wise old proverb, instead of carrying out
this arrangement: “Man proposes, and
Heaven disposes.” It was now five o'clock;
there were still four hours to wait; he knew
not how to employ himself; he became rest-
less. His father was gone to the brewery ;

ness ; Winny was at her lessons. Having
determined what course to take about his
shares, these no longer occupied his mind.
Being, on the contrary, in the dark, respect-
ing what was destined to pass between him
and the youth, whose reply he now awaited,
and being still more in the dark, as the
reader knows, respecting what had already
passed between that gentleman and Miss
Whitsund, Cuthbert's conjecturing thoughts
had flown before his messenger, and were
already at Childering Hall. What could
he do? Till the errand boy had brought
him back a reply, he was unable to fix his
attention upon anything else. He pictured
to himself his rival receiving the letter he
had written, and answering it. But he had
never seen that rival. Now, we often form
pictures to ourselves of persons whom we
have not seen, and whose likenesses we have
not seen. But hardly anybody permits
himself to conjure up these mental portraits

definitely, save where they are safe from
being destroyed by reality. Cuthbert went
a step further, and, figuring to himself
Algernon, of whose varied accomplishments
he had recently heard so much—whose
traces, whose very shadow, had, for several
consecutive days, met him at every turn-
he took a sheet of thick drawing paper and
a pencil : he was an excellent draughtsman.
How is he going to occupy himself ?
Mechanically, while the “working brain,"
to use Lord Bacon's expression about the
hapless Sir Thomas Overbury—while the
“working brain,” was busy, the hand sought
expressions for the thought in a language
not confined in its duration to a few cen-
turies, and in its range to one country or
one race, but as universal as the imagina-
tions of men, as permanent as the passions
of humanity itself. Down on the paper,
line after line, touch on touch, was shed the
weird and shadowy portrait of a mere

interior vision. Absorbed, excited, Cuthbert
was receiving from Algernon Childering,
whom he had never seen, or, rather, from
his wraith, a sitting “ to have his likeness
taken.” The heated fancy laboured magnet-
ically after the impalpable, the eluding
lineaments. He traced not what was—that
was not before him to study—but what
must be ; that was before him to study. It
was an odd caprice, but if any one had
caught him thus occupied—who could pene-
trate the absurd expectation, the wild con-
ception? Who could convict him of any
chimerical attempt? What more common
than to trace fancy sketches both of field
nature and figure nature ? Painters fre-
quently favour us with fancy portraits of
the remarkable dead whom we long to know,
the dead of whom we should wish to obtain
just one glimpse. Cowardly criterion ! Safe
test of their divining art! No test at all,
rather; the dead cannot come to rebuke, by

their look, the preposterous misrepresenta-
tion, the misleading caricature. A wonder
of another sort is related (apocryphally) of
Lavater, the physiognomist; he is said to
have once actually accomplished what Cuth-
bert was here attempting. Your “clear
seers,” in a fine mesmeric frenzy, undertake
as much every day.
There was hanging on the wall a strange,
faint group, shivering in a Polar desert.
They filled the dismal and ghostly fore-
ground of a boundless, icy wilderness. It
was the copy of a “mesmeric” sketch of
poor Sir John Franklin and his companions,
made—when there was question of one
expedition more, “just one more” by a
renowned “ clairvoyante,” in the confidence
of a person who warmly advocated that
humane insanity, that soft-hearted mistake.
“I wish you could see them,” says the
gentleman. “I see them !” says the lady.

quent sketch, as a curiosity. Was it less
visionary than Cuthbert's manner of speed-
ing the moments which he knew not how
otherwise to basten in their flight ?
He was in the drawing-room of Lea
Meadows. It was a warm and beautiful
day; the windows were open ; the doors of
the verandah were open ; you could have
stepped out upon the little lawn on one side,
and the still more sheltered flower garden
on the other. The fragrant breath of summer
came, with a gentle rustle of vine leaves,
into the apartment.
Cuthbert was deaf to the sweet whisper
of the leaves, blind to the enrapturing
radiance and glory of the sunshine, insensible
to the callow exhilaration of the air. Bent
over the mysterious portrait, his whole mind
was absorbed in the singular task he was
attempting

gently away. And the eye? A swordsman
—there is the eye! And the hand must go

Therefore, thus! But stay—is he the same
who wrote the fable of “King Must and
King Cannot,' to help a sweet child's mental
progress ? What do I say ? Mental ? Her
moral progress, too. Is he one and the
same person? Then his forehead must be
less square—this front less lionlike—this eye
must be softer. There !—it is complete.
Heavens! what a face ! ”.

This singular production of the pencil is
in the author's possession.
Young Harding leant back, and held out
the portrait before him at arm's length ; and
again he exclaimed-
“What a face! Heavens, what a face !
I can almost pardon her! I'll draw no
more !”
He was as much alarmed by his own pro-
duction as Richard by the apparitions in his
sleep.
Observe now, had Cuthbert broken this
rash vow, instead of keeping it, his life, you
know, would have been different. I need
not repeat what has been said about trifles ;
we never know what is a trifle. But, at
least, we sometimes know what is not a
trifle. And art is not. Art is softening,
humanising, and ennobling in its culture ;
above all, art is candid ?
But Cuthbert never drew again for his
amusement. It may here be observed that,

on no former occasion, had he satisfied him-
self with the executive success of his pro-
ductions. Now, however, caught up by the
unusual visions of the mind, and carried by
passionate excitement beyond the egotist's
low, particular firmament, he had reached
another region, another“ plane” (to borrow
a scientific term), another “plane” of
thought, and the faithful hand had fixed,
in an enduring form, the fleeting and tran-
sient view from the mountain tops of a
waking dream.
Enough of this. He had fallen from that
height when, suddenly, his eyes were firmly
blinded by two small hands, from behind
the chair on which he was leaning back.
“Guess who it is !” cried a most unnatural
voice.
“Who but Winny ?” said Cuthbert, good
humouredly; and the child bounded round,
and began to look over the table. Cuthbert
turned the drawing with its face downwards.

“ Where were you all the morning ?”
asked Winny.
“At Panes cum Piscibus,” replied he,
“ with Uncle Marlowe.”
“Odious man !” exclaimed the child.
“Why odious ? what has he done to
you ?” asked Cuthbert.
“He has done nothing to me,” replied
Winny ; " but he was so cross towards you
the other night.”
“Oh! never mind Uncle Marlowe,” re-
turned Cuthbert—" I've forgiven him. I'll
make a bishop of him, and then he'll forgive
me in return."
This tickled Winny's imagination ; she
laughed and said —
“Forgive you for making him a bishop!
He won't forgive you unless you do ; but
how will you do that? Can you make
people bishops ?”
“I couldn't make you a bishop, Winny;
I might make you—-"

: “No,” interrupted she—" you think me
a fool, Cuth ? I know a great deal more
than you think ! There are no women
bishops. Aunt Marlowe will never be a
bishop, never-even if uncle is.”
“Then you see,” said Cuthbert, “in order
that I may be able to make a person some-
thing, the person must be fit for the some-
thing. If I was Prime Minister of England,
I couldn't make Parson Trustemall a bishop,
because he isn't fit for it; he would be such
a ridiculous bishop, that I should be a ridi-
culous Prime Minister.”
“I don't see that,” replied Winny. “If
you can make a person— "
“Nonsense !” interrupted Cuthbert, “you
do see it. I can make a pen, can't I ? But
I must have the right thing to make it of.
I couldn't make a pen out of a stone. Ah !
you understand now. Well, Winny, I can
make something of you, perhaps, some day;
but you must be fit to be made something

of, or I could no more do anything, good
for you, than I could make a pen out of a
stone."
“Well, Cuth, dear, and am I not good ?”
repeated she. “I will try all my might,
I am sure.”
Cuthbert felt a satisfaction for which he
had not bargained in giving this easy,
casual, unpremeditated lesson, so quickly
learnt, to his little sister. Had he con-
tinued always to speak thus to her, he
would have had one day a pleasant recollec-
tion. But at this moment she noticed the
sheet of drawing paper, face downwards on
the table, and over it her brother's hand
resting weightily.
“What are you hiding there ?” she de-
manded, trying to peep under the paper.
The fiend returned, and flapped a dark
shading wing over the thoughts which had
been so bright a moment before. Under
his hand lay the imagined likeness of the

individual whom he detested most on
earth.
“Take care !” said Cuthbert, so angrily
that the child recoiled. He felt sorry.
“Well, look then,” added he, turning up
the sketch.
“Who is that ?” ejaculated the child,
after a few instants of silent wonder, and
still lost in evident delight.
“I do not know,” said Cuthbert; “I
never saw that person.”
“Never saw him, Cuth! Don't tell fibs.
That is an angel, then?”
“Well, when you have looked enough,
tell me.”
“ There ! ” cried she.
“You said, just now, that Uncle Marlowe
was an odious man,” observed Cuthbert,
“merely because you had seen him cross
with me. But, you perceive, I have for-
given Uncle Marlowe. What would you

“ That he was a devil !” said she, with
innocent vehemence.
“Then,” continued he, “you love your
brother Cuth very much ?”
“Very, very much I love him !” she res-
ponded, putting an arm round his neck, a
feat she was able to accomplish, inasmuch as
he was sitting, while she stood.
“Are you sure it is so very much ?”
asked he.
“Quite, quite sure.”
“Come, do you love him as much as
cherries ? ” he demanded.
“Much, much more,” she rejoined,
earnestly.
“ Well, I have an enemy, whom I have
reason to hate, Winnifrid.”
“Who is it? I hate him too,” answered she.
“ You'd tell !” said he.
“Never !” she replied—“ never, Cuth.
Who is it?"
“You have never seen him,” he persisted.

“No matter — who is it? What is his
name ?”
“ It is Mr. Algernon Childering,” said
Cuthbert.
“What! I heard Uncle Marlowe talking
about him to Mr. Geoffrey Mandeville the
night you came.”
“That is the person.”
“And that person has done something to
you, Cuth ?” she asked.
“ He has done what he can never undo,”
replied he, gloomily.
“Then,” exclaimed she, “I hate him with
all my might!”
A little while since it was, “ I'll try to
be good with all my might.” Cuthbert
felt a vague compunction, he knew not why
---a secret discontent, he could not at once
have said with what.
At this moment, Mrs. Harding's voice was
heard calling Winny, and the child left him
once more alone.

The intellectual excitation under the in-
fluence of which he had produced the imagi-
nary face and figure of a person whom he
had never seen, had its revulsion, as a stone
flung into the air has its fall. The higher
the throw, the heavier the coming down.
Cuthbert feļt depressed, languid, and fatigued.
The warmth of the air, the rustle of the
leaves, the humming of insects, all the con-
fused, low, tranquillizing sounds of a summer
afternoon, disposed him imperceptibly to
slumber. His head sank over his hands
upon the table before him; and thus, lean-
ing on the “magnetic” sketch, he closed
his eyes, and almost immediately fell fast,
asleep.
Hardly was the light of day thus excluded
from the bodily eye, when the mind began
busily to light up its own interior, impal-
pable pageantries, and Cuthbert had a singu-
lar dream.
His mother- but much older than she then

was, her hair grey, her features wasted, the
colour quite faded out of her cheeks-stood
before him, like an apparition of the dead.
In her left hand she held a portrait, to
which she pointed with her right, while her
eyes were fixed upon her son sadly and even
reproachfully. Following the indication of
the balf-raised right hand, Cuthbert looked
at the portrait. It was, in some manner,
different from that which he had sketched,
but he felt that it was the same subject,
that of Algernon Childering. His mother
spoke, but her voice was as though it had
been the voice of one at a very great dis-
tance; the words reached him faintly, like
words spoken with difficulty across the roar
of a cataract; they seemed to come to him
---and, perhaps, they came over the torrent
of intervening years.
“He," so ran her speech, “strove to bene-
fit the child Henrietta Mandeville, who was
nothing to him ; he made simple, easy, and

familiar to her mind high reflections, coura-
geous and heroic ideas of duty, to which
she then was, and might long have remained,
a stranger. And you—you have already
sought to implant the accursed principle of
hatred in the innocent heart of your own
sister! What had my child, Winnifrid,
done to you, that you should so very early
seek to poison her young spirit with the
worst of all evil passions ? What am I to
think of my son in comparison with this
youth? What wrong have I, your mother,
wreaked upon you that you should so soon
try to kill my child's soul ?”.
This last question of his mother, and the
glance by which it was accompanied, in-
spired him with such terror that he awoke,
and, looking up, saw Mrs. Harding at a
little distance, her eyes affectionately and
anxiously fixed on him.
“I fear that you are not well, dear,” she
said.

“Oh,” replied Cuthbert, still under the
impression of his dream, and comparing his
mother's appearance with the wan phantom
which had rebuked him—“I am quite well,
mother-only a frightful dream. I'm glad
I am awake. What time is it?”
As he said this, he absently took out his
pocket handkerchief, and a little glass phial
rolled on the table before him. Mrs. Hard-
ing prevented it from falling to the ground.
“Medicine ! ” cried she, glancing at the
phial. “Why, you must be ill !”
“No, mother, I assure you,” he answered.
“ That phial was not intended for me. It
contains the poison which I prevented Lady
Mandeville from taking. I have somehow
kept it as a curiosity.”
“Well, dear,” said she, “let us now
destroy it. It is not safe to leave such a
thing about.”
“Give it to me,” said Cuthbert. “I pro-
mise you it shall not be left about. But I

should not like to destroy it. I feel an
interest in it; naturally enough, you will
allow. I have asked Mr. Wilson, the chemist,
all about its properties. It would have killed
Lady Mandeville in ten minutes.”
“But why not destroy it now?” persisted
Mrs. Harding.
“I don't know,” replied he. “I think I
should like to keep it. It will remind

“Of a noble act, Cuthbert,” replied she,
giving him back the phial.
The young man winced.
“Of a fortunate one, at least,” he mur-
mured.
“I call it noble," said the mother. “Your
motive was to save another's life; and, to do
it, you endangered your own.”
Cuthbert did not dispute the first of these
propositions, although he did not seem at
ease ; to the second he said, carelessly-
“Geoffrey Mandeville would have endan-

gered his life. I did not consider that I
was endangering mine. A good swimmer
deserves no great credit for venturing into
the water.”
It had a rather abrupt sound to say, as he
did say, immediately after this
“Were you laughing, mother ?”
But he had scarcely put the question
when he seemed ashamed of it; while yet
his eye ranged uneasily round the apart-
ment, as if he thought some stranger might
possibly have overheard their conference.
Mrs. Harding slightly and slowly shook
her head, and said something in the lowest
of all possible tones, so that no ear less
morbidly attentive, less nervously excited,
less suspiciously and eagerly strung than
Cuthbert's could have caught her words.
Nevertheless, on Cuthbert's they fell as if
struck by a sledge hammer—and he was
literally startled, affrighted, by their import.
They were merely these :

“You should pray, dear !”
Ere he could reply, Mr. William Harding
entered the room hastily, with Winny hang-
ing on the skirts of his coat. He took out
his pocket handkerchief, rubbed his forehead,
said it was warm walking, and announced
that he was hungry.
It was announced to him, in reply, that
he was later than usual, that it was near
seven o'clock, and that dinner was quite
ready. “ Can you spell that, Winny ?” says
the father. “How does it go—d-i-nner,
dinner ?” But Winny could not be induced
to sing the required tune this time, and the
family at Lea Meadows adjourned to their
little dining-room.
Mr. Harding explained that, when about
to return from the brewery an hour ago, who
should happen to call but Mr. Brompton ;
and that unexpected visit had detained him.
“I suppose,” said Cuthbert, “he is a very
clever man ?”

“ Why ?” asked his father.
“Because he has made so much money
out of nothing."
“That is not much of a reason,” said Mr.
Harding. “Some cleverness, no doubt, of
a certain kind is necessary; and activity,
incessant activity, still more so. But what
is wanted, above all, is the right constitution,
or temperament. With a little intelligence,
and very great activity, money is sure to
come to a man-on one condition.”
“What is that?" asked Cuthbert.
“ That a man should adore it,” returned
the father—"that he should make it his god
-that he should strictly treat it as our
Blessed Lord tells us He desires us to treat
Him-be ready to leave father, mother,
brother, sister, children, and wife !”
“What ! for the sake of money ?"
“ Yes ; and his own life also. Show me

bottom of his heart, and I'll show you the

man to whom hundreds of thousands are
pretty sure to come; but then he must not
stop to enjoy them. All his enjoyment
must be rigorously confined to the making
of money. Let him be satisfied with that,
and then he will make it, I'll warrant him!”
“But,” said Cuthbert, “I hear of people
who rack their brains all day and all night,
in great cities and a great city is, surely,
the focus of all money making ; people who
show intelligence much above the average-
that is one of the conditions ; and who
never cease scheming — that is another ;
and who, notwithstanding, are never out of
want."
“You've named two of the conditions,”
said Mr. Harding ; "where is the third ?”
“Oh! you said wickedness, or a hard
conscience, or something— "
“I said no such thing. A hard conscience
is required, but every kind of hard con-
science won't do.”

“Ah! well! that a man must be un-
scrupulous,” urged Cuthbert. “Well, the
people I mean are unscrupulous, and
starve !”
“Let them be as rascally as you please
—that is not what I said ; every kind of
rascality won't do."
"Well, that they should,” pursued Cuth-
bert,“ make a god of money—that they
should be ready to give their souls for
money.”
“That won't do,” thundered Mr. Harding;
“that is not enough!”.
“Not enough !” exclaimed Cuthbert, “to
be ready to give your soul for money !”
"No," said his father ; “not half enough!
Money requires more of a man than that ;
money is jealous. You must not be the
man to give your soul for anything else.
Now, if you more closely examine these folk

will find that they have many gods: they
are polytheistical idolators. They are not
single-hearted in their devil-worship. One
of them worships his belly altogether ;
another, at least his bottle; another, his
vanity; so that he is for ever starting ; for,
it is clear, that if he expends all his gains
in show, he can have nothing to reinvest.
Now, Cuthbert, you see, in the start, every-
body with thoroughbred pluck can hope
to succeed once, though it were the hun-
dredth time of trying ; but two good starts,
my lad, or, rather, an incessant repetition
of good starts, amount to an exorbitant
expectation. Well, another of these money-
seekers dearly loves his chat and his chum ;
in fact, worships what is called society.
None of this will do. Money requires the
undivided man—a holocaust of himself ; his
whole time; his whole worship; his whole
soul. On that condition, I repeat, the
divinity will accept the slave; will come

to him and dandle him in tortures; will
rock him in fires, and pat him on the head
with the throb, throb, throb, of never-ceasing
anxieties ; and will thus stay with him
sometimes all his life-sometimes not. But
money is jealous ; the idolater must worship
neither any one thing that is good, nor any
other thing that is bad ; if he does, then,
instead of having a single strong devil to
rake his vitals and make him rich, he will
have a legion of minor imps to flout in
his face as they pass by, and to leave
him unsuccessful, and, comparatively, un
teased.”
“ It seems rough teasing," muttered Cuth-
bert, “ by your account.”
“Such teasing defies any account I can
give of it, my lad,” pursued Mr. Harding.
“And there is another thing which money-
making on a great scale asks for. A
man must not worship his devil among
minorities."

“What does that mean?” said Cuthbert.
“Why, the majority of men have agreed
among themselves, in all countries, respect-
ing the kinds of wickedness which are to
pass current as an offering to the idol in
their social state ; and, likewise, the kinds
which are not. These last are not always
the worst. It is not proper, in England,
to eat your grandmother : it used to be a
laudable action, in certain cases, among the
South Sea islanders. You could not make
money either way ; I merely mention it as
an illustration. You might, perhaps, think
slavery a bad thing. A man of business in
one of the southern states of the American
Union would keep this view to himself, if
he wished to make money. To express it,
would rather help him a little further north.
A parallel of latitude—as Sydney Smith
would have said-makes the money-getter's
moral difference in all these cases. Morality,
as such, is not necessary; but the morality

of the majority is necessary-whatever it
may be.”
“Do you mean to say that no good men
have made immense fortunes ? ”.
“No, I don't. I am talking of a class
who are generally sure to make money, and
who, alone, are sure beforehand. I do not
pretend that none but such have made it.
In fact, there is a class which is nearly
always meritorious, among money-makers.”
“Who are they?”
“ Those who produce to sell. Those who
buy to sell are quite distinct from them.
Yet even those who buy to sell become rich,
sometimes, without one low characteristic,
or one mean action. All I maintain is
this, that money can be made, in heaps,
on certain conditions, and I have named

them.”
After dinner, Mrs. Harding went to sit
in another room ; Mr. Harding thrust his
feet into his slippers, and lit his pipe.

An indifferent conversation went on for
some time. At length, Cuthbert said —
“Father, I am going to make the prodi-
gal's request, namely—to ask you to give
me my portion, and let me go.”
“Where do you want to go to ?”
“To London ; if you have not fixed on
some plan for me.”
“Well, Cuthbert, I have not much to
spare. Years ago, I thought our little
dwindled property, with the name of a
country gentleman for its master, a poor lot.
I wanted to increase my means, even at the
forfeit of losing caste in the county. I set
up this brewery; it has made me lose caste,
as I foresaw—but, I'm sorry to say, it has
not brought me what I should have con-
sidered a very good exchange for it, wealth.
On the contrary, I am, perhaps, lower than
when I started—even in a pecuniary point
of view. My credit is good, but if all my
debts were called in to-morrow, and if those

to whom I owe money were all to come on
me together, I doubt if I am even solvent.
I have sometimes thought, lately, of putting
up the business and the entire interest to
public auction, and thus getting rid of an
old anxiety.”
“Nay, according to what you say,” replied
Cuthbert, “ that would be a bad move. If
it is only by credit you swing, you must not
break the branch till your foot finds ground.
You cannot, I infer, spare anything for
me?”
“I did not say quite that, Cuthbert. I
said—not much. But what are your own
wishes ? what do you mean to do?”.
A woman servant here entered, and gave
Cuthbert a letter, which, she said, Hum-
phrey's boy had just brought. Cuthbert
looked at his watch.
“Excuse me, father,” said he, and, with
some eagerness, he broke the seal, and read
Algernon Childering's note. His lip curled

with a cold sneer as he refolded it, and
put it in his pocket. Yet it made him
thoughtful.
“You see,” resumed the father, “ the
army, as you hinted, the other night, your-
self, would be absurd. There is no ad-
vancement in this country for an officer
without interest, and what interest could I
command ? Otherwise, I admit that no-
thing could be more kind than Sir Walter's
offer."
“What did Sir Walter say of me besides
offering to get the commission secured ?”
inquired young Harding.
“Well, he said,” replied Mr. Harding,
“and I must allow that he used the most
delicate terms—he as much as said, you
know-in short, he made me clearly under-
stand that he would not suffer me to be at
any expense in the matter.”
“Indeed !” said Cuthbert. “A very
handsome offer !”


## p. 164 (#172) ############################################

“Yes, only I cannot turn it to account
for you; because the army is out of the
question.”
Cuthbert made no reply to this; but,
soon afterwards, looking at his watch, re-
marked that he had something to do, and
left the room. As he passed, he looked
into the drawing-room, and told his mother
not to expect him at breakfast next morn-
ing, for he had to be in Throstledale very
early, but would be home again in the
course of the day; and, meanwhile, he
wished to write some letters in his own
apartment; “therefore I will say, good-
night,” he added. He declined her offer
to send him a cup of tea upstairs.
When alone, he felt unusually restless.
As there was something masterful and
haughty in the tone, so there was some-
thing off-hand and superior in the style
of Algernon Childering's brief note. The
room seemed to Cuthbert too small for him.

He threw up the window. The fine day had
been succeeded by a cloudy evening ; it was
only the more in harmony with his mood ;
the slumber which had surprised him in the
afternoon, forbade rest now; he determined
that he would go out, and walk off his
unquiet sensations. Then a new thought
occurred to him. “I know I shall not sleep
to-night,” said he to himself; “my mind
is too distracted : I shall remain tossing in
bed for three or four miserable hours, after
which I shall fall into such a heavy slumber,
that I shall be too late for Throstledale.
Stay; the inn near the railway must be
open all night; passengers constantly meet
the up train there at half-past two; I may
as well set out this minute, and walk to
Throstledale at once, like Mr. Melcombe the
other evening.”

Thus armed, he stole forth, and was soon

striding briskly along the high road between
the two plantations, mentioned in a former
chapter. On coming to the little gate, he
hesitated whether he should not take the
short cut. But his object was not to save
time, or to abridge his walk; it was rather
to pass the time, and, by violent motion to
tire down the fretfulness of the mind: a
very good method. He was not quite sure,
besides, whether he should, by night, know
the short cut, or be able to keep to it in
the darkness. The little path, which dis-
engaged itself clearly enough to view for
a span's breadth, beyond the swing gate,
was swallowed up by the jaws, as it were,
of total obscurity, at the distance of a few
yards.
“The road is better," thought he ; and
he pursued it accordingly. He was soon
plunged in thought. “ “ He does not know
any foolish thing so wicked,'” muttered he,
with a sneer, “cor any wicked thing so

about that Frenchman at Lyons ? Oh, he
is sorry for that, perhaps—won't be a

settled; I left the manner to him. Does
he want me to think that, no matter what
weapons, it would be all the same! In-
solent coxcomb !”
Cuthbert had, by this time, emerged from
the plantation upon a more open part of the
road, and, in the dim and misty light, he
observed, at a short distance before him,
two figures, approaching rapidly. As they
came up, he saw that they were dressed like
sailors—a circumstance not very remarkable,
since sailors have friends, sweethearts, and,
sometimes, even their homes in the midland
counties—yet still not quite so much in rule,

Cuthbert fancied, as it might be in other
parts of England. Each of the men carried
a short, heavy stick. They had passed him
without a word, when, before they had
made more than two or three paces, they
stopped. On hearing the footsteps cease
behind him, Cuthbert looked back, while
still continuing his road. The two men had
turned. He halted and faced them.
“Heh! master,” cried the bigger of the
two, “can you tell us how far it is from-
from Huntingferry ?”
“Some eighteen miles,” replied Cuthbert,
mechanically loosening the blade of his cane
sword.
“ And what o'clock is it now, master, if
you please ?” said the same voice.
The two men slowly and naturally made
a step or two towards him,
Cuthbert, with his left hand, took out
his watch, but it was so dark that he could
scarcely see the figures to which the hands

mere
pointed. Glancing up, he was in time to
catch the smaller of the two men nudging
his companion, and indicating something
with the eye. Following the man’s glance,
he noticed the quaint chimney stacks of
Lea Meadows standing indistinct, yet at no
great distance. The cottage, in fact, was
within shout, for the road, as has been
already explained, made a bend here, and he
had not gone so far from home as the mere
distance which he had walked would have
taken him by a straighter route.
“ Can't see to tell you to the minute, my
man,” said Cuthbert, “but it must be about
a quarter past nine."
The fellow had anticipated him.
“I can give you a glim, master,” said he ;
and Cuthbert saw the blue flash of a lucifer
match, as the man scratched it against the
top of the matchbox. The provision seemed
curious.
.“ We've a weary trudge, I'm thinking,”

added the big sailor, holding the light to-
wards Cuthbert, as soon as it had become
clear white. ,
“ Exactly a quarter,” said Cuthbert,
glancing again hastily at his watch, and at
once resuming his own road.
“ Thankee, master,” said the other, and,
as young Harding looked back, he saw
the two figures dissolve in the obscurity.
They also had resumed their previous way.
“What an ill countenanced ruffian !”
thought Cuthbert. “That lucifer was
lighted, no doubt, to see what sort of cus-
tomer I looked. But the cottage was too
near; and if they caught the gleam of the
gold watch, they noticed likewise the flash
of the steel cane. Perhaps they will follow
me, though.”
He halted, and listened. No; he heard
the tread grow more and more faint, and
presently die in the distance. It seemed to
him even as if the men ran. What, if they

were going to lurk about his father's, and
attempt a burglary there this very night?
He had plenty of time, he was a good
runner; he should like to see whether they
passed the cottage ; it would be a satisfac-
tion. He returned rapidly and softly.
When he had convinced himself (according
to the distance, and the speed with which
he had traversed it) that now he must again
hear their footsteps, he stood still. Not a
sound, except the monotonous twitter of the
leaves, and the occasional sweep of some
large branch in the plantation, as the wind
touched the trees, like the pipes of an organ,
with its wandering and melancholy music.
“ Can they have stopped ?” thought he.
He should have seen them in that case, or
should now see them. No human shape was
visible along the straight and solitary line of
road, which receded beyond the cottage, in
the opposite direction. The reach of sight, in-
deed, was but short in the obscurity. Cuth-

bert concluded that they must have passed
on, merely wondering at the rapidity of
their pace. This he attributed to their
anxiety to make short work of the long
journey they had before them.
Dismissing the subject from his mind, he
again pursued his own way; and it is curious
that not once, till he had got long past
the spot where he encountered the sailors,
did it occur to him as possible, that they
might have turned into the swing gate of the
plantation and so have taken the short cut.
It was a short cut back, as their road lay ;
not forward. He had many other things
to think of. Besides, such is the mechanical
effect on a person's mind of whatever he
happens to be eagerly doing at the moment,
that because Cuthbert was just then pur-
suing these men, it did not occur to him
that they could be at the same time pursuing
him.
Now, however, this did occur to him, and

he determined to be upon his guard. He
was approaching the place where the path
in question rejoined the public road. He
proceeded with great caution, treading
lightly, listening attentively, and watching
the hedges on both sides. “How stupid of
me,” he said to himself, “to take it for
granted that they must be sailors, just
because they wore the dress. I'll be bound
they are no strangers to this country, but
could walk every inch of it blindfold.”
As he said this, he drew the blade from
the sword cane, and moved into the shadows
at the side of the road; for, now, the moon
had somewhat got the upper hand of the
drifting clouds, and half the way lay in her
beams.
He knew that, if these two suspicious
specimens of sailors, who thought it needful
neither to march from Throstledale to
Huntingferry without a lucifer match box,
nor to set out from their starting point, the

former town, till evening—he knew, I say,
that, if they had taken the short cut, they
must have reached the spot where it re-
covered the main road long before he
reached it himself. What would give them
a still longer advance of him was, his
abrupt return upon their traces. They
would, therefore, at this moment, be in
wait for him; but his own delay would
have already appeared to them unaccount-
ably protracted. Were he only to creep
through the hedge and sit quietly down in
the shadow for a quarter of an hour more,
they would give him up altogether; they
would conclude that he had changed his
purpose, and had either returned home, or
gone somewhere off the road across country.
In this very neat little calculation, two cir-
cumstances were against him; he lost sight
of a contingency, which he might as well
have taken into account, and he was
ignorant of a fact not less important. The

contingency was this, that, inasmuch as
the short cut climbed straight over the
back of a hill round which the highway
slowly wound, a person, proceeding by the
former line, commanded, at certain open
points, a view of whatever, and whoever,
might be journeying along the latter. This
he might have known. That which he
had no means of knowing was, that the
two individuals against whom he was exer-
cising his strategy, had a comrade following
them at leisure; a friend somewhat crippled,
for the moment, in his marching capabilities,
by the eccentric nocturnal behaviour (in his
own house, too) of a Staffordshire country
gentleman, living about twenty miles off,
almost on the borders of the two counties,
who (in reference to this third) had, one
night lately, only half fulfilled the hospitable
precept of the poet, for he had omitted to
“welcome the coming,” although he had
certainly “sped the parting guest.” The

guest was our sailor's friend. He was a
stalwart man, but walked not, at present,
with his usual agility; whereupon his
amiable companions had turned towards
him, and had thus expressed their views.
“Now you don't suppose that we are
going to lag like you, and this country
getting so hot; we shall go along, and you'll
follow after.”
At present however, they were anxious
to spare him the anguish of meeting alone
a young gentleman who carried a cane-
sword as well as a gold watch, and, perhaps,
other interesting articles. They would like
to fall in with this gentleman again, three
strong, and not too near a dwelling house.
As to the delusion that he had altered his
mind, or was not coming along that road
at all, two pair of eyes from the brow of
the overlooking hill had verified the con-
trary; and a couple of trees, against which
the watchers leaned their backs, would have

saved their figures from standing detached
against the sky, even if the wayfarer below
had ever dreamt of turning his glance in
that direction.
They had, at first, looked, indeed, too
far forward, and when, at length, they
noticed Cuthbert's figure emerge into the
moonlight, much less advanced than they
had expected, the taller said to the
smaller—
“Look, Ben, see if he has not been after
us. Well, that was attentive and kindlike;
now, we'll be after him.”
Meanwhile, in this duel of generalship,
Master Cuthbert, in order to execute the
nice plan which he had so ingeniously con-
ceived, turned off the highway, and lay still
and meditative, a little afield, but in the
shadow. So replete was his head with
abstracting thoughts, that even more than
the intended quarter of an hour flew by.
“ London is the place," muttered he ; and

straightway he forgot the place where he
reclined, which, however, was very interest-
ing. It was a ferny dell, a long dried
watershed. The road made a dip, which
corresponded with the hollow on either
hand. A watercourse had, no doubt,
brawled there in ancient times, when stout
men gathered round King Alfred, and
Saxon fought with Dane ; or, earlier still,
the woad-striped savages battled with the
short sworded, large bucklered Romans of
Agricola or Caius Julius.
It wasn't of this Master Cuthbert was
thinking, when, after a considerable interval,
he looked once more at his watch, and
found it ten o'clock. He rose from the
damp and ferny ground to resume his walk.
But it is not in deep thought alone that
time flies fast and unremarked. “Those
men” had not a watch by which “ to note
its loss,” but they had a flask to make them
forget its passage. They were not tired out.

As Cuthbert passed the spot where the
short cut and the road met, the place itself
recalled him from his abstraction. But he
passed unmolested ; and now he began to
walk with greater speed, and with less
caution. The road was here very lonely,
and far from all human habitations. The
nearest he knew, by its situation, to be
Childering Hall: he could barely see the
great pile in the doubtful light, on an
eminence about two miles distant. An
increase in the number and in the size, as
well as a more ornate disposition, of the
timber on one side of the road, made him
aware that he was coasting, so to say, the
extensive park which belonged to that old
mansion.
He stopped for awhile before descending a
hill which he had gained into a dark hollow.
The hedges close to him sparkled with the
jewellery of the glowworm ; and, from that
ļittle rim, so to speak, a great picture was

rolled away from his feet into the valley,
and was then lifted along the face of the
opposite hill, rich in trees and glades, until
the Hall itself filled, and completely closed,
the dim and uncertain background.
Suddenly, a red light was flung like a
spear of fire across the entire landscape, and
then, as though it had not parted from the
giant hand which shook it, the long meteor
went quivering over the green woods, while
the shriek of the railway rent the stillness.
Distant as was the great black mass which
was whirled through the air with the speed
and fury of a sorcerer's chariot-for the road
which it traversed was invisible where Cuth-
bert stood-it made the earth tremble under
his feet.
The mighty sound had scarcely passed,
when two men seemed to rise out of the
very ground before him, and a third, spring-
ing from the hedge on his left hand, rushed
at him and endeavoured to bear him down.

This attempt was baulked simply because
Cuthbert had instinctively recoiled from
the sudden apparitions in his path, so that
the ruffian at his side precipitated himself
upon empty air. He did not pass across
Cuthbert's front, in his ill-aimed spring,
without receiving under the ear a left-
handed blow, well paid out, which made
a hundred bells ring in his skull, and which,
having caught him exactly at the moment
when he was off the ground, sent him, like
a battering ram, endwise and head foremost
against one of the men beyond. Cuthbert
would have instantly turned and run from
such odds, only for a circumstance which
told him, far more quickly than it can be
told again in words, that to run would be
fatal. That circumstance was the glitter
of a pistol barrel in the hand of the taller
of the two front assailants. Flight could
not have put him beyond reach of a bullet

out of point blank range. Otherwise, there
is no question whatever that the old familiar
plan, sanctioned by the classic example of
the last of the Horatii, is the only means
by which a single adversary can equalize
his chances against three. It is ten thou-
sand to one that no two, much more that
no three, footpads will overtake their flying
enemy at precisely the same moment ; for
which reason, firearms and projectiles apart,
the fugitive, if resolute and alert, may
always contrive to deal with them in suc-
cession, give him but a yard start, and a
clear run.
In the present case, the pistol made the
difference. No running, therefore, would
do. Instinctively, Cuthbert would have
dealt first with the man who held the pistol.

blade which now shone level as a beam from
his hand. At the first glimpse of the two
figures which barred his further progress
along the road, Cuthbert had mechanically,
and in the very act of halting, shouted at
the top of his voice, had whipped out from
his innocent looking stick the long, straight,
three-edged, rapier-fashioned sword, and had
thrown himself into the position of guard.
The next instant brought up that flank
enemy whose rush the motion just described
had so opportunely, though unintentionally,
enabled him to avoid. This was not all ;
duly followed the hearty, left-handed blow
with which he had sent that gentleman to
commence a new rush at right angles with
his first, and which had put Cuthbert out of
attitude for a moment; and when he was
again leaning back“ in guard,” he perceived
that it was not his friend with the pistol,
but bis other friend, who had received into
his arms the unexpected weight of the dis-

comfited flank assailant. Out of the three,
one was temporarily disabled, the other
temporarily encumbered. The third was
the very personage for whom Cuthbert
would, in any case, have reserved his chief
compliments, inasmuch as he was the bearer
of the long shining barrel. Cuthbert, from
the instant when he first caught the glitter,
had never lost sight of this individual, whom
he recognized as the sailor who, an hour ago,
had been anxious to know the distance to
Huntingferry, and the exact time of night.
All the by-play that has been related,
occurred in the twinkling of an eye ; but
now young Harding lunged in earnest. The
spring of the panther is not more rapid.
Somehow, the man had drawn inferences,
from the unexpected position in which he saw
his comrade cleave the air; and when he
saw Cuthbert, all of a sudden, vanish from
before him (the forward movement was so
prodigious in its vehemence, that the ruffian

literally lost the view of it), he blunderingly
and nervously swerved. That blind swerve
saved his life, but his right arm was spitted
through and through.
The long blade became discoloured ; the
whole weight of the lunge fell on his
chest; and, as he was borne violently to
the ground, three startling sounds cleft the
nocturnal silence. These sounds mingled
together in a wild and strange discord.
They were the report of the pistol, dis-
charged convulsively, and without aim, by
a hand clenching itself in pain, the yell
of the wounded felon, and the shrill, fierce
shout or cry with which Cuthbert had made
his spring.
He was dragged down by his falling
adversary, and he struggled in vain to
recover his feet. The man who had dropped
the pistol clutched him powerfully by the
throat ; nor was Cuthbert, with all his
youthful agility and vigour, any match in

this situation for the robber. Still the latter
was losing blood, and, had but these two
been engaged, young Harding would have
ended by shaking off the gripe. As it was,
the wounded man had the odds for him.
With an oath, he exclaimed
“Why don't you give him the knife,
Ben ?”
Cuthbert made a violent effort to wrench
himself round, and, in consequence, the other
villain partially missed his aim; the weapon
which had been intended for the nape of the
neck, glanced along the shoulder blade, in-
flicting a long, ragged, flesh wound. Again
the knife was lifted, and Cuthbert saw that
the third man, also, had now regained his
feet. All this, I repeat, passed in a far
shorter time than it has been told. Cuthbert
gave himself up for lost. His situation was
like that in a nightmare ; he was fast locked
in the grapple of one strong ruffian, and in
the hand of another; while literally power-

less to move, he beheld the flash of the
descending stroke, which he had no earthly
means of either parrying or evading.
It is said that, in drowning, during one
supreme and awful moment, like that of
the flash of the lightning in its passage, the
mind of a dying person passes in review his
whole previous life, not in a vague summary,
but with overwhelming distinctness, and
according to all the minuteness of its long
forgotten, but true and real particulars.
Those who have been recalled from the
final swoon which succeeds that solemn
momentary vision—the swoon out of which
the patient would have, otherwise, passed,
unwakened, into death — all attest this
strange and most suggestive fact. Nor
ought the possibility of it to be doubted
by those who have ever pondered on the
wonderful swiftness, subtlety, and might of
the mind, when stung into sovereign exer-
tion by some adequate excitement.

Something of this sort occurred to Cuth-
bert as the swift gleam of the knife played
over him for half a second in the moonlight,
and then descended, like a flash of lightning,
on his spine. Years crowded before his
mind's eye; nay, not crowded—they rather
unrolled, the miraculous rapidity of their
diorama with the most exact and orderly
circumstantiality. His last thought, as he
involuntarily closed his eyes in despair, was
his mother; he saw her reproachful and
melancholy look; he saw her attitude as
she pointed to the portrait of his detested
rival, Algernon Childering ; and then fol-
lowed the nocturnal walk, the very road on
which he now lay, the bank before him,
jewelled with the glowworm, the pale moon-
light, the ruffian form whịch bent over him,
and the murderous dagger as it descended.
It descended, but touched him not. A
light figure, contrasting with the vile group

an instant. He saw the assassin reel back-
wards under a mighty blow, and bebeld,
leaning over him, the face of a young St.
George-full of interest and kindliness, yet
luminous still with what has been well
called “the light of battle,” the effort of
some desperate conflict. But the loss of
blood bad rendered Cuthbert faint, and the
sudden scene vanished in total unconscious-
Dess.
He remembered nothing, knew nothing,
of what followed, until he awoke, and found
himself upon a strange bed, in a strange
room.

It will be remembered that it was in total

of the scene in which he had been surprised

at last, had sunk so helplessly. It has been

tating glimmer of a little night lamp, placed
on some vague piece of furniture, the outlines
of which he could doubtfully trace. Where
he was, or what was the present date, he
had not the remotest suspicion, beyond this,
that it was, at least, night time. After a
few minutes, during which his ideas came
gradually back to the brain, like pigeons
returning one by one, or in pairs, to the
dovecote from which they have all been
scared, he called out, timidly and gently-
• Who is there?”
No answer, nor had he quite realized the
great silence till now. It made itself
oppressive, by contrast, after this low-voiced
inquiry. It was, at present, palpable ; nay,
in the same sense in which Milton speaks
of a “darkness visible,” this was suddenly
become a silence audible--he felt it humming
in his ears. Not much liking it, he called
out once more-
“ Is anybody there ?”


## p. 193 (#201) ############################################

193
No answer.
“It is clear,” thought Cuthbert, “ that it
is the very dead of night, and that I am
alone. Let me once more go over my plans.
London is the place !"
He had scarcely entertained the reflection,
when his hair bristled upon his head.
“ Ha! ha! ha!”.
That shrill, mocking peal, rang faintly,
and, he thought, at some distance. He
knew not whence it came.
He was the most dauntless of youths, but
he required to see an enemy. Like all per-
sons endowed with the really highest kind
of courage, he was of a sensitive and delicate
nervous organization. At present, he knew
not how he had come hither, nor, indeed,
where he was.
It was not without a sensation of awe
that he now held his breath, and listened.
He sat up in the bed.
“ This is madness !” thought he. “I

must control this. It is a downright miser-
able delusion !—the mere coinage of my own
brain."
Cuthbert remained perfectly still, his head
bent forward in a listening attitude. No
sooner had he mentally used the expressions,
“a miserable delusion, the mere coinage of
my own brain” than once more he fancied
that he heard this laugh as though replying
to the thought, but far away—and with that
muffled or obstructed effect which is occa-
sioned when the person to whose voice you
are giving heed, has already turned his back.
Yet, if the mere sound seemed to grow
feeble or remote, the tone of it—the mean-
ing—was even more hideous. It appeared
to be the very ecstasy of scorn-deliberate
scorn, I say, rapt into ecstasy.
Stricken mute and motionless by horror,
Cuthbert required a few seconds to recover
himself.
“I could almost fancy,” muttered he,

“ that the abominable mouth from which
that strange laugh came dribbling out, like
water trickling from a dark cave, was
averted, was averted! —as if the thing had
been summoned off, and was going, but had
heard my thoughts."
His hands were clenched while he thus
muttered. After a moment or two, he
added, more coolly-
“I don't believe in what cannot be seen
or heard by my friends—by others, and I
never found anybody who had heard this
laugh ! however distinctly it may have rung
in my own ears. Except—hum! my mother,
now I think of it, did seem very serious,
and very sad. She knows more about all
this than she said. I must have a conversa-
tion with her alone—and in confidence.
She loves me. She will tell me. Perchance,
a disease! “No fool ever went mad,' they
say; and, perhaps, no timid, fawn-hearted
person, trembling every day at the visible,

was ever visited by these mysterious and
unreal-yes,” he added, breaking out of his
meditative whisper, and speaking aloud-
“these unreal horrors. Thus we are
humbled—thus, in one way, if not in
another, we are made to pay the tax of our
mortality. Decidedly, I must have this
conversation with my mother, which she
always seems to avoid.”
After a few minutes, during which he
listened calmly, while the silence continued
unbroken, he turned into a new but kindred
train of thought.
“What a strange thing she said to me,”
he pursued—“what a strange idea ! ‘You
should pray, dear.' And her voice sounded
so low, and sweet, and gentle! And she
looked so kindly melancholy! It is curious,
too, that, long ago, when I used to—to pray,
I never had these-- Nay, now I think of
it, how very, very odd! The first time I
heard that laugh—-".

He mused deeply for many minutes.
“I remember it,” muttered he, “as though
it had been last evening! One day—a
beautiful day it was--when I chanced to be
with Tom Falconer and Geoffrey Mande-
ville, near the river, at Eton. It was out of
bounds—ah! what a day! And Falconer
was saying that he was in such spirits, for
he had had a letter stating that his father
was recovering—was quite out of danger.
* Ah! Cuthbert, cried poor Tom, “I prayed
so hard for this ! I don't suppose my
prayers are worth much ; but God is so
good, you know.' And I remember saying
something which made Tom fire up imme-
diately. He had the best of the argument,
too—that can't be denied. I felt it even at
the time; and then I said, that, for my part,
I proposed to take care of myself.”
“" Exactly!' cried Tom. “So do I; but
while you fulfil this proposal, it will be as
well for you not to forget Whose is the dis-
posal.'

“«Why, whose but every man's own ?'
exclaimed I; for I was put out. Poor Tom!
He appeared wonderfully shocked; even
Geoffrey didn't seem to like it. Before
either of them had time to answer me, I
heard it. And, Heavens ! one would almost
suppose that this was my answer. At first
I thought it had been Geoffrey or Falconer.
But they were as grave as judges. They
did not seem to understand me when I asked
who laughed. They had evidently neither
uttered a sound, nor heard one. That was
the first time ; and it is curious that my
mother should—-
“But no !” he pursued—“I don't believe
in what cannot be seen or heard by others ;
by the friends around me, for instance, in
broad daylight. Yet, which of those friends
has seen or heard my own soul ? and I must
believe in that. Which of theirs have I
seen or heard ?”

pillow; and almost immediately a deep sleep
relieved him from the unwonted, or, at least,
unwontedly directed, torrent of remembrance
and conjecture.
When he again awoke, daylight enabled
him to discern rather more of the scene
around him.

It was a neat, antiquated, prettily furnished,
rather large, but low ceilinged apartment
upon which Cuthbert, this time, opened his
astonished eyes. “Where am I ?” was the
first question he asked himself, after that
curious and even ludicrous mental process
through which all of us, who ever knew a
large and venture-fraught era in the
chequered days of youth, have once, pro-
bably, passed in our turn, but which those

who have not, will believe impossible—that
· process, I mean, wherein a still more primary
query has been asked, and, at length, an-
swered by the stunned and bewildered mind.
He had gone beyond this: his busy
thoughts were come, as has been said, to the
“Where am I ?” He recalled, one by one,
the incidents—was it of last evening ?-
what evening was, it ?)—knitting up the
ravelled web of recollection, till he beheld
again a long knife, like a ray of bluish light,
lifted for a renewed and more fatal blow,
while he was powerless to writhe himself
out of its range; the sudden interposition
of some powerful party—the staggering
assassin—the indistinct momentary glimpse
of a friendly and brilliant, but unknown,
countenance—all the sequel, a dark void ;
or rather, the immediate sequel—as if by
enchantment, this very room, this very bed

curtains, beautifully clean, out of which

soap and water had nearly washed the
pattern; and, through its faded draperies, a
roseate light of sunrise, which had first been
filtered, and almost scented, as it passed
across a little wilderness of flowers in the
window.
All these, and a multitude of other details,
his eyes conveyed to him as their contribu-
tion towards the solution of the question.
Then it was clearly morning—and early
morning; for he noticed that the light was
on the increase. It promised to be a
delicious day. That window was not fully
closed-for, in the first place, he could dis-
tinctly perceive the perfume of the exu-
berant, portable garden, which was contained
in the boxes and pots ranged upon its sill
outside, and throwing up against the radi-
ance of morning the most lovely of blinds,
the natural filigree of intertwining little
branches, tremulous leaves, and beautiful
flowers, the shadows of which danced and

quivered upon the panes. He particularly
detected the scent of clematis and the
double geranium. In the second place, he
could, with equal distinctness, hear various
external sounds : the song of the birds, the
whetting of a scythe at no great distance,
and, still nearer, the trundle of a wheel-
barrow, and the heavy tread upon gravel of
a gardener's hob-nailed shoes. All seemed
at peace around this pleasant room ; and he
gradually felt himself lulled into a half
dreamy state of idle musing—into those
reveries, into that agreeable haze of contem-
plation, so well known to convalescents.
He did not care. to move for some little
time. He was astonished at himself for
taking interest in trifles which would not
generally have arrested his attention. “I
am become,” thought he, “another person.
I have acquired a tranquillity, a philosophy,
an evenness of disposition, perfectly delight-
ful, and rather new."

He was mistaken ; he had not acquired
anything ; he had lost something—a little
blood. Breakfast would make a difference
-would bring back the old man.
“A nice pheasant on the chintz curtain,
that,” he pursued—“ humph! good design !
only the tail of the bird ought not to be
longer than the trunk of the tree on which
she perches-that's certain !”
He felt thirsty. Looking about, he per-
ceived, on a stand near the bedhead, a
covered jug and a tumbler.
“Decidedly, I am bewitched,” he mut-
tered ; “and this is the house of a friendly
enchanter."
He turned to pour himself out a draught.
Suddenly, he uttered a low cry. The thin,
cutting lash of a whip, all alive with stings
from the thicker end down to the delicate
knot of whipcord which tipped its vipery
tongue, seemed to have been applied know-
ingly to his back. He then more distinctly

recollected the grazing wound which the
first blow aimed at him had given, when
the knife glanced along his shoulder blade.
Pursuing the examination of the furniture,
his eye alighted on a chair, where he saw
his clothes tidily folded. On the little pile,
stained with unmistakable streaks, lay the
blade of the cane sword—or, rather, half
the blade, for it was snapped across ; against
the chair leaned the sheath—as thin, tall,
black, and empty, as Don Quixote. Imme-
diately over that chair glittered the old-
fashioned brass bird's tail, which, he knew
was duly continued by a brass bird's back,
and, finally, by its beak, firmly biting a
brass ring. The tail was in the air now,
and the beak was stooping, but it was a
balancing lever, and whenever that tail was
pressed back to its natural and more proper
position, the bird sang—in other words, the
bell rang.
It rang now, and very vehemently, in

“You know my name," answered Cuth-

“My name is Ezekiah Panton,” said the
white figure, “ but I don't know the young

“Well, Mr. Panton," resumed Cuthbert,
" that is mysterious. Now, will you kindly
supply me with one or two pieces of infor-
mation ?"
“ You have but to give your orders, sir,"
replied Mr. Panton, “and I obey.”
“You are extremely obliging, I am sure,”
said Cuthbert. “Now, in the first place, be
so good as to tell me in what latitude and
longitude I am situated at the present
moment."
Mr. Panton started; he even looked
amazed.
“Slightly feverish!” murmured the black
figure.

“A slightly feverish latitude, sir?" an-

suppose. It seems a very nice atmosphere,
too; and I perceive, by your speech, that
I have the honour of addressing fellow
countrymen. Therefore, I infer that we are
still within the British Empire, on which the
sun never sets—ahem ! But, to put my
question in plainer language, I want to
know precisely and exactly where the deuce
I am !"
“Outskirts of Throstledale,” returned the
black figure.
“Pheasant room,” added the white figure.
And Cuthbert, glancing round the apart-
ment, noticed, in fact, that not the chintz
curtains of the bed alone, but likewise the
paper on the walls, were embellished with that
marvellous representation of a pheasant, on
which the tree should have been perched,
rather than that overgrown gallinaceous
specimen upon the tree.

“Good eating, that bird !” remarked
young Harding.
"Splendid 1” returned Mr. Panton, “but

“Whenever it is,” pursued Cuthbert, “it
will dine twelve persons : you may tell them
I said so."
Mr. Panton opened wide his eyes.
“Feverish—very feverish ;” said the black
figure.
“What!” cried Cuthbert, “feverish again?
feverish eating, I suppose? Well, I never
knew that before. And so, Mr. Ezekiah
Panton,” added he, "you know my name,
but you don't know that of the young
gentleman from whom you learnt it. What
was he like?”
“Quite the gentleman, I assure you, sir,”
replied Mr. Panton. “He came in Lord
Havisfling's carriage; and you accompanied
them, sir.”

"Oh, indeed! I accompanied Lord Havis-
fling and the—the gentleman. Don't re-
member it in the least, on my honour.”
"Shouldn't think you would, sir ; your
head was gone, and it was lying, besides, on
his shoulder; and then your legs were on
the opposite seat of the carriage.”
“ Interesting position !” cried Cuthbert.
“Legs on carriage seat; my head gone, and
the said head on his shoulder. But on
whose shoulder ? On the lord's ?”
“No, sir,” replied Mr. Panton—“on the

Something in the manner with which this
was said, struck Cuthbert exceedingly. He
pondered, perfectly mute, for about half a
minute—his large, eloquent, deep, grey eye,
fixed intently on his informant. Although
intuitively grasping the man's hidden mean-
ing, and even more alive to it, more con-
scious of it, than the speaker himself, who

very particular attention to the casual infer-
ences which always thus hang upon the
skirts of conversation—although, I say,
Cuthbert was fully awake to this latent and
collateral import of the answer, he affected
quite the reverse, in order to “trot out” his
new acquaintance—a constant and invariable
practice in the keen and mighty times of his
youth, and, indeed, until—but I must not
anticipate.
He accordingly said to Mr. Panton-
“Then, although you don't know who
this young gentleman was, you know, it
seems, that, at least, he was not also a
lord ?”
“ Not I, sir—you'll excuse me,” replied
Mr. Panton. “He may be a young duke,
for all I know. He looked like a young
prince, I am sure, or a young king, for that
matter.”
Cuthbert felt a thrill, or rather a shiver,
run through his whole frame. Somebody,

one.

as the gloomily poetic vulgar saying is,

was stealing, by a force mightier than he
could resist, out of his strong grasp, and
passing, gliding, all gently, but irresistibly,
fatefully, as he thought, into the hand of
another—a successor—a supplanter. The
impression was only momentary. He re-

“No; not if I know it."

thoughts, and then, with a sudden snort,
resumed.
“Well, sir—Betsy gave us a start when
she said that.” (Cuthbert, for fear of more
episode, refrained from apprising the ex-
cited narrator that he had omitted to men-
tion what Betsy said.) “And I found Lord
Havisfling excusing hisself to the young
gentleman because he couldn't let him have
the carriage to go on for the doctor, for he
was bound to catch the train ; and then,
says the young gentleman, 'I'll just run to

finding you sleeping, wouldn't let you be

“I am very grateful to you, Dr. Arm-

"Well, we seem to be even better than I
had hoped,” said the doctor. “A dressing
is all that will be needed.”
“Pray, doctor, as soon as possible,” said
Cuthbert. “Is the station far? And what
hour is it?”
“Not much more than half a mile. That
is, from the other end of the little town.
What hour ? It is scarcely half-past seven.”
“Good. In a moment I am at your
service. But first tell me, Mr. Panton,
what more did you hear the two gentlemen
say?”
“Well, sir—Betsy heard more than I did;
the women always do, I think, in these
cases. It seems, from what Lord Havisfling

“Yes, sir—the young gentleman.”
“The same, do you say, who was crying

“Yes, sir, and who went afterwards for
the doctor."

foot ?"
“Beyond doubt,” replied Mr. Panton ;
“and ran. I had, of course, no conveyance
ready.”
“How do you know he ran ? Did you
see him ?”
“No, sir, for I was up here with you.
Beyond running down the stairs, which he
took at one spring from top to bottom, I
couldn't see him run. But Betsy did ; for
she opened the door to him, and told him
the way to Dr. Armstrong's house ; and she

you know of angels?' says Mrs. Panton to
her, ‘you jade !' says she; "what angels

You understand, sir, he was a young gentle-
man to make the women talk, and the

“Well, he was handsome, sir. I thought
at first, from his anxiety like, that he could
not be less than own brother to you, sir.”
“Indeed !” said Cuthbert. “Was not
Lord Havisfling, then, equally kind ?”.
As the name of the nobleman need not be
given, this disguise will serve as well as
another.

bruised and discomfited state in which I
have made my appearance in your excellent
house, but it is a positive fact, that I am
very well disposed towards anything the
doctor here may kindly allow me in the
nature of a breakfast.”
“A little weak tea,” suggested the doctor.
“ Precisely,” responded Cuthbert, with a
grimace. “And, Mr. Panton, a couple of
mutton chops or so with it, ahem! The tea
not too weak, you know—not too weak.

“You shall have the gig, sir ; and my

“A thousand thanks,” said Cuthbert.
“Now, doctor, I am at your commands.”
“And if the gentleman calls, sir,” inquired
the innkeeper, “ I suppose you will see
him?”
“What gentleman ? Oh, true! But do
you think he'll call ?”
“Why, sir, I'm sure I don't know. He
seemed like a brother to you. Only a
brother wouldn't have taken half the pains,
mayhap."

fully. “By all you tell me, I should

unimportant, though painful, was soon
dressed.

CHAPTER XII.
“A stripling bold, with mischief in the blink
Of his keen eyes ; as cunning as divine :
Now down the limpid skies his pinions sink,
Now winnow upwards where pale meteors shine.”
KENT'S Aletheia.
It was a beautiful morning. The railway
station was three quarters of a mile from
Throstledale, by a charming road, which
wound between hazel woods, and high, over-
hanging banks. Cuthbert well remembered
it, as was shown by the brief conversation
which passed between him and old Hum-
phrey on the occasion of his nocturnal
arrival with Geoffrey at Lea Meadows.
After breakfast, the gig was announced
by Mr. Ezekiah Panton in person, who,


## p. 224 (#232) ############################################

moreover, accompanied Cuthbert to that
magnificent vehicle, and would have helped
him to mount thereon, having already
thoughtfully placed cushions to support his
back. The officious services thus proffered
were declined. Cuthbert went round, in-
asmuch as the “near” side happened to be
the furthest from the door, while the “off”
side had been drawn up close to it; and,
of course, in the loftier seat there appro-
priated, the driver sat already. This was
Ezekiah’s son and heir; a youth who had
been early caught and tamed, and who
looked as if he should not approve of the
nineteenth century.
When Cuthbert (not with his usual ease)
had slowly ascended to his place, on that
tranquil-minded individual's left hand, he
felt in the breast pocket of his coat for
the letter to Mr. Falconer, and said —
“First, to the post-office."
“Why, that's the other way,” remarked
the lad.


## p. 225 (#233) ############################################

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
225
“Is it ?” replied Cuthbert. “The other
way, then.”
While absently making this reply, he
drew out his watch, and, to his great sur-
prise and vexation, found that it marked
three o'clock. He exclaimed something to
that effect, but was immediately comforted;
for the intelligent driver expressed his be-
lief that it must be yesterday's three o'clock,
and that the watch had swooned off, as well
as its master. “ 'Twarn't ten, nor nothing
like it.” This suited Cuthbert's arrange-
ments to a nicety. His telegraphic message,
which would arrive in London as soon as
it was sent from Throstledale, would in-
fallibly find the laborious Falconer at his
chambers ; there was no necessity for hurry;
the broker would be produced that same
day, and on the next morning, after receipt
of his letter, his small first “investment”
would be satisfactorily terminated.
The gig went steadily to the post-office;
34

then turned and went steadily towards the
railway station, along the delightful country
road already mentioned.
“You weren't ever run away with, were
you ?” inquired Cuthbert, with grave and
amiable solicitude, of his companion, who,
in the discharge of his duty, was shaking
the reins every now and then over the cob's
shiny back, and chirping encouragingly to
that collected animal.
The youth looked round, saw Cuthbert's
immovable and very serious countenance,
and pondered a considerable time. At last
he said
“By a woman?”
“No,” replied Cuthbert, with equal slow-
ness and solemnity; " by a horse.”
The lad chirped, shook the reins, and
cleared his throat. He then observed silence
for some time ; after which, he said, most
clearly,
“I warn't never run away with by a
wcman."

“But you were, I dare say, by a horse ?”
suggested Cuthbert.
“Well,” responded the youthful driver;
“I warn't never run away with by a
horse."
“That is a good thing,” remarked young
Harding, with feeling.
They now proceeded in silence for about
half a quarter of a mile, when the youth
suddenly said
“But Jacky Thompson war.”
“Really!” exclaimed Cuthbert. “Where
was that?”
“That was in Lancashire, I hear tell.”
“I suppose he is a very young person,”
said Cuthbert.
“No, he ain't! He ain't to call young ;
he’s near eighty," said the driver, chirping
to his steed. “But he war young,” he
added, “ once."
“When was that ?" asked Harding.
“When?” replied the youth ; “well,

it was before my time. I never seed him
young.”
“And when was he run away with ?”
“Well, that was before my time.”
“Dear me l” cried Cuthbert, and a long
silence ensued.
They had steadily neared their journey's
end, when an extraordinary sprightliness
seized upon young Harding's companion.
He chuckled, and he cracked his whip, then
he said
“But I mean to, though !”.
“What ! to be run away with ?”
“Ah! to be run away with ; see if I
doan't-one o' them days."
“Pray, let me get down first,” said
Cuthbert.

eyes.

“Noa; but by Betsy, though.”
“That's the other horse, I presume ?”
said Cuthbert.
“No; it's the housemaid,” replied that
wicked young man ; and the gig stopped as
he spoke. “She'll bring me to crying of
the banns and the halter, she will—if I
doan't mind."
“Oh! she'll not do it,” replied Cuthbert.
“You'll be able to prevent her.”
This seemed to puzzle the youth ; but
his countenance soon cleared. What he
might have said, however, was lost, for
they had now arrived. He pulled up within
an enclosed space, where a great many vehi-
cles of all sorts were collected. They were
waiting for a train, which was a little be-
hind its time.
Cuthbert proceeded to the telegraph room.
Being furnished, by a civil clerk, with a
form, he wrote his message to Mr. Fal-
coner, and paid for it. As he required an

answer, he asked when this might be ex-
pected.

"There is only the delay,” replied the
clerk, “ of the messenger from Euston
Square to Lincoln's Inn. If your friend be
at home, we may have an answer for you in
little more than an hour.”
“I'll come back in an hour and a half,"
said Cuthbert; and he lounged towards the
platform of the station.
It was littered with luggage, and crowded
with porters, travellers, and servants. Bus-
tling amongst these, Cuthbert beheld a figure
which he at once recognized. A person's
back has sometimes a physiognomy as well
as his face. The individual was Mr. Brad-
worth. He turned and approached.
As he passed, his quick eye lit for a
moment on Cuthbert, and he whispered in
that young gentleman's ear the emphatic
monosyllable-
“ Sell 1 "

Cuthbert thought that the look implied
"you are sold, if you don't.” No doubt it
did.
The various packages had all been, for
some little time, labelled, and every proper
detail of preparation was over ; for the ex-
pected train was late. The consequence
was, that the porters were standing idle,
and the station master was looking placid,
as the passengers were beginning to look the
reverse. In the numerous throng, Mr. Brad-
worth was the only person whom Cuthbert
knew, but he was not the only person whose
appearance excited his curiosity; especially
as there were two individuals, utter strangers
to him, to whom, nevertheless, he himself
seemed to be not unknown, as they, just
before, were approaching him, with a pecu-
liar expression. When they passed, he
naturally followed them with his glance,
and he noticed that one of the two looked
round, as though the other had been

speaking about him (Cuthbert). Even with-
out this circumstance, there were, lounging
to and fro, or standing, several of those
figures, concerning whom one feels inclined,
at an idle moment, if in company with some
person well acquainted with the scene, to
ask, “Who is that—and that?”
Being in such a disposition he wished he
could monopolize, for a few moments, the
station master's attention, and he secured
his object by a slight civility.
“You appear to know most of these per-
sons ?” said Cuthbert, halting beside that
functionary, who stood a little apart, hold-
ing by the hand a small boy, who was no
official, and therefore not forbidden to-in
short, to do what those employed are for-
bidden. “Many of them are familiar to you,
no doubt ?” pursued Cuthbert. “Who are
those two gentlemen, with a sort of military
air ? The one nearest us is very hollow
cheeked, and pale.”

“Those, sir ?” replied the station master,
in the same low tone—“ those are Mr.
Childering, junior, and Lord Havisfling
(here the proper title of the last mentioned
person was given). You are right, sir; they
are military. Both are in --” And he
named the regiment.
“Oh!” thought Cuthbert—“that accounts
for the air of knowing me which one of
them had. Lord Havisfling remembers my
face, from last night. It was the other—it
was Childering who looked round.”
“You don't mean,” said he, to the station
master, “ that yonder sickly and spectral
person is Mr. Algernon Childering ?”
“Don't know his Christian name, sir,”
returned the other ; “ but he is Mr. Child-
ering's heir."
“He is going up, now, I suppose ?” said
Cuthbert.
“Those two are, both of them, up tickets,
sir,” said the official. “Now, there goes a

remarkable person, sir, since you are curious
about the passengers.”
And he drew Cuthbert's glance towards
a gentleman of very self-possessed manner,
who was walking briskly up and down the
platform. He was of small stature, rather
under than over the middle height; the
nose by no means a sneak, but bold and
emphatic; small, sagacious eyes, an olive
complexion, a thick moustache, cut to join
the chin beard, like a pair of scimitars hung
to guard that firm and taciturn mouth,
which seldom opened. The jaws were mas-
sive, but not at all angular; they declined,
by due gradations, into a grand, classic
chin. Striking as was this countenance, the
entire head, beautifully built and set, like
that of an antique statue, upon the throat,
was still more arresting to a thoughtful and
discerning eye. Although the figure, as has
been stated, was rather under than over the
middle height, it was marvellously well knit,

buoyant, and powerful. The chest, at once
deep and broad, the back straight and flat,
the waist thin, the hips without a bulge, the
limbs light, the step alert, all told of as-
tonishing physical vigour, directed, pro-
bably, and moved by one of those nervous
organizations in which it is impossible to
calculate what they can accomplish ; but,
above all, what they cannot, and will not,
accomplish. This personage carried in his
right hand a slight, flexile “ dragon ” cane,
with which, as he perambulated the plat-
form (the mind absent and at work), he
switched his leg and foot; and, by-the-by,
that foot also was remarkable, so perfect,
and even delicate in form—so massive, and
yet rapid in the step. It is not easy to
describe the play of the cane, to which allu-
sion has been made; it was thrown out with
a shower of little jerks and curves, and then
brought smartly back to the boot with a
single rap. Altogether, everything about

the look and movements of this individual
betrayed—character.
“Yes, I see him,” replied Cuthbert, to the
station master. “Who is it?”
Cuthbert was there merely to amuse
himself, and pass the time till he got
an answer from London to his telegraphic
message. But incidents were destined to
occur which turned his brief and idle
saunter upon that platform into business
and fatality.
Instead of replying to him, the station
master rushed away from his side with a
look of horror. The next moment he was
startled by the screams of women, and by
a burst of exclamations from the men.

BULWER LYTTON, King Arthur.
It has been stated that the station master
(Mr. Ashby) instead of answering Cuthbert's
last question, though it was a question which
his own previous remark had invited, darted
away abruptly, and with a look of horror.
The cause was apparent at a glance. It
seems that Mr. Ashby's little boy, whose left
hand the father had held locked in his, when
Cuthbert accosted them, suddenly found
himself free, while the functionary pointed

towards the individual whose appearance
was described at the end of the last chapter.
Now the child had an orange in his right
hand, and he no sooner found himself re-
leased than he took advantage of the oppor-
tunity to practise a little bit of tossing and
catching, an art and mystery to which he
had not been long introduced, and in which
his heart burned to excel. He was by no
means a proficient yet. He never measured
the toss with correctness, and had not even
learnt to make it with moderation.
On the present occasion, little recking of
a loud bell which had just rung, his energies,
long pent up, revenged themselves for that
confinement by an uncommonly vigorous
fling of the orange perpendicularly. So he
had meant; but the ascent not being per-
fectly straight, the descent was parabolic,
and landed the orange, in the first instance,
upon the forehead of the olive complexioned
stranger, who, seeing the eager, upturned

'suer
gaze of the child, had, for a moment, looked
up himself. The accident did not derange
the gentleman in the least. On the con-
trary, he smiled with an amused expression.
Meanwhile, the orange had rebounded upon
the platform, where it was vehemently pur-
sued by the child. Kicked by one person's
foot accidentally, and knocking against
another’s, it rolled hither and thither, the
pursuer wriggling in and out after it, among
the shifting groups, with greater swiftness
than judgment or success. Finally, the
orange slid off the platform into the hollow
tramway of the railroad itself, and was
followed without hesitation by its little pur-
suer, who bounded down.
✓ But why had the bell rung? A heavy
train, laden with pig iron and other weighty
commodities, not destined to stop at that
station, had come in sight. It was at full
speed, and, in that manner, with unslack-
ened pace, was bound to pass. Already the

great roar of its rush preceded it, like
the spray whipped off outridingly before a
mighty sea, storm driven. Already the
very platform began to quake in the first
faint vibrations of that throbbing and trem-
bling, with which it ever does homage to the
powerful and terrible giant when he thunders
past.
The child, all unconscious of his appalling
position, had triumphantly chased the slip-
pery fugitive to its final resting-place, right
between the sleepers of the approaching
engine. There had still been time for the
poor little fellow, only that, in his eagerness
to dart upon the orange, he struck it with
his foot even as he stooped, and he fell flat.
What followed occupied but two or three
seconds; to tell it is another affair.
The engine driver had noticed the poor
child utterly too late to arrest the rush of
his machine, yet it would stop a hundred
yards further down the road ; he had taken

ns
the usual measures; it was the eagerness,
the absorption of the little boy himself,
which was accountable for the situation.
The man was seen to fling up his arms with
a gesture of despair, as the dread object of
which he seemed the figure head, swept up,
like the sudden dilatation and advance of
some monster in the magic lantern.
It was a little before this, or, indeed, it
may be said that it was practically at the
selfsame moment (for all took place while
one could shout alarm), that every living
soul upon that crowded platform became
simultaneously aware that a child (uncon-
scious of its own fatal position), lay on the
very track of the speeding train. Then
arose that confused, but heartrending,
medley of cries, in which there mingled
a woman's piercing scream.
The reader must understand that, in all
these cases, the really hopeless moment, and
the moment rendered practically hopeless

by nothing else than the horror of the
bystanders and the panic which paralyses
all action, are very thinly divided from each
other. It is a nice matter to distinguish
them. None but a truly eagle-eyed spirit
can mark the critical line, or measure the
hair's breadth of the distance. And none
but a dauntless heart can act on it; can
make use of that delicate vanishing percep-
tion. The chance for life turns its edge, not
its blade, to the glance; and few there are
that can see it. “Too late !” exclaims
within itself the terror-stricken mind – and
it was not too late ; but ere the thought can
pass away, it has become too late.
Thus it is always; nine hundred and
ninety thousand, with as many hundreds,
tens, and units, out of a million men, pre-
date the fatal instant in their own horror,
and make it fatal.

sons on that platform, who shared not this

otherwise universal and thorough palsying
of the mind. One was the olive-com-
plexioned stranger who has been described ;
but, although he could ocularly take in the
scene where he stood, he was comparatively
too far from it, and there were too many
between him and the poor dear little boy,
for any action whatever on his part. The
only emotion he betrayed was in a compres-
sion of his lips, a cessation in the play of
the little dragon cane, and the arrest of his
march to and fro. He stood still, but he
made no gesture, much less uttered any
exclamation. Another, not worse in courage,
was better placed.
Something had, meanwhile, shot across
the road, indefinite as the shadow from a
careering, hand-broad summer cloud, and,
the next instant, the mighty engine and the
long train went by with a thousand thunders
-swift as a meteor. Cuthbert had clenched
both hands, if the truth must be confessed,

and had shuddered from head to foot. On
the opposite side of the railway, still within
the tramway, and in the hollow road, lean-
ing against the stone parapet which, nearly
hip high, lined it, stood the handsomest
youth whom Cuthbert had ever beheld,
grasping what seemed a mass of clothes in
his right hand. He held this mass by the
back of the neck collar, and, jerking it upon
the flag behind him, vaulted thither himself.
The mass of clothes in question began forth-
with to run about; and in one of his little
hands Ned Ashby still firmly clenched the
treacherous orange.
The young gentleman who had performed
this feat of rescue (and who was, of course,
the second of the persons to whom allusion
has been made as the only two in the whole
crowd that retained their coolness), was now

leading the child—and tried to efface himself
in the crowd.
Vain attempt! A stupendous cheer arose,
as if with one voice and from one heart. So,
accepting the proffered grasp of the poor
station master's hand — which, by-the-by,
made his delicate white fingers tingle-he
escaped towards a young lady and an old
gentleman, the former of whom had her
back, and the latter his face, turned in
Cuthbert's direction. Cuthbert recognized
his uncle, Dr. Marlowe Harding, and divined
that the lady who was with him, and whose
scream he had heard, must be Miss Emily
Whitsund. He saw that the stranger, the
young gentleman, appeared now to be as
confused in the presence where he had pre-
cipitately sought refuge, as he had been
amid the applauses of the more miscellaneous
throng; and, immediately afterwards, Cuth-
bert lost sight of him altogether : he had
disappeared from the station.

“I wonder," thought Cuthbert, “what my
uncle and Emily are doing here ? I'll not
speak to them ; but I'm hanged if I skulk !
I shan't put myself out, because they happen
to be in the way.”
Meanwhile, the station master's first pro-
ceeding was to' cuff his boy right lustily,
and then to give him a very hearty kiss ;
after which, he repossessed himself of the
tiny hand, confiscated the orange in per-
petuum, and repaired to his former place
near Cuthbert.
“ You may thank Heaven for that escape!”
said young Harding.
“And so I do, sir, on my bended knees,”
replied Ashby, as erect as a dart, without a
thought of kneeling, and with great drops
of perspiration on his forehead; “and I
thank that young gentleman, too !”.
“Who is he?" inquired Cuthbert; “I
half think I have seen the face before.”

Ashby; “ but as soon as ever the express
goes by, I mean to find out. I'll pray for
him all the days of my life. That I will !
See if I don't! That's all !”.
At this moment, Dr. Marlowe Harding
happened to see his nephew, and bowed with
uncommon formality.
The haughtiness of the salute was nothing
to the haughtiness with which it was re-
turned. Emily, turning round when she
saw her guardian bow, recognized Cuthbert,
and sent him, with a bend of her graceful
throat, a kindlier acknowledgment, which
was duly requited. She was very pale; she
looked ill and suffering.
Scarcely had these distant civilities been
interchanged, when Cuthbert observed the
two gentlemen concerning whom he had
asked the station master (they were Mr.
Childering, junior, and Lord Havisfling, nor
did Cuthbert for one moment confound the
cadaverous-faced person before him with

that Algernon whom he had never yet
knowingly seen), join Dr. Harding and Miss
Whitsund. Presently, the one with the
hollow cheeks and glassy eyes sauntered
away; while the peer, who still remained,
began to speak with much gesticulation and
apparent earnestness to Emily and the
doctor. Cuthbert, ere long, guessed the
subject of the discourse. His uncle repeat-
edly held up his hands, as if in wonder, or
in admiration, at what the nobleman was
saying. A shifting of the groups here
brought Emily's face into view. Cuthbert
was surprised by the change in its expres-
sion, indeed, in its whole appearance. It
glowed with blushes, and an agreeable ex- .
citement animated the eyes as she listened.

“Ah!” said young Harding to himself, “it

brought to the Sheaf and Sickle, last night.

adventure, and Emily is pleased. But what
pleases her so much ? Is it my escape ?

it he also who saved that child's life a
moment ago ? How is it, otherwise, that
I half knew the face? Was not that the
very face which bent over me in the doubt-
ful moonlight, when the descending knife
glided aside like a broken or diverted ray ?
Just this instant, it seemed like something
I had seen, I could not recall where. Now
I understand it all. But to think of my
saying I would have his life, and he destined

proposes, but not disposes.”
And he sadly watched Miss Whitsund as
she listened to the voluble narrator.
It was while he was in this abstraction
that the stranger, who had already excited
his curiosity, happened to pass between him
and the group. Rousing himself with an
effort, he again drew the station master's
attention to this person and said-
“You were going to tell me who that
foreign-looking gentleman was.”

Before giving the station master's answer,
it will be well to anticipate an objection to
what may appear to be an anachronism, but
is not. The misdating, indeed, if any there
were, would be only the misdating of a
name, of a word, of a popular designation ;
the thing would remain dated rightly
enough. In a former chapter old Hum-
phrey is represented as making some allu-
sions to the insufficiency of the rural police;
now it was insufficient. He is represented,
also, as alluding to one man who had been
let out of prison on a licensing ticket,
and to others who had broken prison. It
need hardly be said that both of these
events had frequently occurred, before popu-
lar phraseology found a term (since become
almost technical) for the former case. There
is a further consideration, which is this—
that, as the incidents connected with the
Harding before us, will come down to nearly
the actual moment in which I now write,

I can with propriety avail myself of the
language in which people would at present
speak of what then occurred, whether a par-
ticular phrase was, or was not, in general
vogue, five, or six, or even ten years ago.
If I be wrong in this (and I do not think
I am), the error is, at least, merely and
solely an error in the writer's manner, not
an error in the facts—which last, by-the-by,
must presently carry us, by a bound over a
few years, much nearer towards the hour
now passing, than is this last to the summer
morning on which young Harding sent, from
the Throstledale station, his first message by
the electric telegraph.
This explained, I return to my narrative.
“ That foreigner-looking gentleman, sir,”
replied the station master, “is a foreigner
like. He lived close by—that is, at Leam-
ington, for a season—but has given up his
establishment there. It is Prince Louis
Napoleon Boney-parte.”

“What? he who is switching his boot
yonder with the thin cane, as he walks up
and down ?"
“Yes, sir-yonder.”
Cuthbert once more perused the points of
manner and appearance which have been
described.
“Well,” said he to himself, “I thought
I had tolerably good courage, yet he never
stirred a muscle during the child's escape
just now. It wasn't want of interest,
neither ; I could see that, well enough. He
looked exactly like one who had measured
the distance, and who knew, at the first
glance, that, where he stood, it was impos-
sible to do anything. And how the eye
glittered when he saw the rescue safely
accomplished by one who was better
placed !”
“Wonderful nerve !” he then remarked
aloud.

master. “I believe you l When that gen-
tleman came first to these parts, he had
never hunted, sir; and I have heard old
Tewkesbury, Lord Woodburn's huntsman,
say that, before the end of the very first
season, not a gentleman at the Warwick-
shire meet rode either so bold or with more
judgment—that was the identical word
Tewkesbury used. If there was any one
at all better than the prince, it was old
Mr. Childering, who is always so tiptop
mounted; none but blood horses, you know,
sir. One of the young Mr. Childerings,
indeed, Tewkesbury said, was nearly as for-
ward : 'twasn't that pale gentleman yonder
with his lordship, but t’other young gentle-
man-I forget his name.”
: “Mr. Algernon ?” said Cuthbert.
. “I think that was the name, sir, that
Tewkesbury said ; but I never saw him
myself. He went to travel shortly, and

according to Lord Woodburn's huntsman.”
“Not so well as the prince, you say ?”
“Well, pretty nearly as resolute almost,
but not so judgematical, I take it. And
that is a wonderful thing when you come
to consider that the prince wasn't born to it,
like any English country gentleman. He
talks French, or some such dialect, I hear
say; and you know, sir, that must go sadly
against the grain of hunting.” .
“I never knew that,” said Cuthbert.
“Well, I should say it would not be
natural, you see, sir. Howsoever, that's the
way Tewkesbury looked at it. “How is a
man to speak to a real thorough-bred Eng-
lish horse in French ?' says Tewkesbury.
* Tell me that !' says he. And he put it to
me very natural, I must say. “If an English
born man can't understand their lingo, isn't
it a leetle too much,' says Tewkesbury, 'to
ask an English horse to be pat in it all at

no nonsense,' says he. He argufied it very
cool and fair, I assure you, sir. “Now an-
swer me candid,' says Tewkesbury; 'would
you expect a French horse to be up in
English first hop?' says he. “Horses are
very clever,' says Tewkesbury, “and when
you know how to draw them out, they'll
learn anything in reason ; but that's rather
too sharp a lesson to put the poor beasts to;
why you wouldn't expect it of a Frenchman,
let alone a French horse,' said Tewkesbury.”
“I understand,” replied Cuthbert.
“That was the huntsman's view of it,
sir," resumed Ashby, “and he ought to
know best, of course. But I am sure I
can't say what the rights of the case may
be.”
Just at this moment, a few brief yet re-
markable words struck on Cuthbert's ear.
They formed two fragments of two conver-
sations; but they fell under the notice of

as
one who was singularly capable of supplying
intuitively the intromitted gaps of informa-
tion, defective in amount, while significant
in character. No hint, no augury, no indi-
cation, was lost on him at that age. If he
failed to penetrate a mystery, it was not
from dulness. A secret had no business to
come near him, unless his objects were
wholly uninterested, wholly uninvolved, in
its discovery. Were this otherwise, let it
but brush him with the skirts of its robe as
it passed, and he held it till he mastered it.
It was while still thinking of the extra-
ordinary person to whom the station master
referred, and while recalling Mr. Melcombe's
striking observation, “that man is sure
some day to play a great part ”; it was
while coupling this remark, dropped by an
eminent statesman, who not only understood
what chances were on the cards, but who
was besides known to be-noted, indeed, for
being—a profound judge of character ; it

was while coupling, 1 say, this remark with
the impressions naturally arising from the
physiognomy, air, and manner, of the indi-
vidual concerning whom it was pronounced ;
it was just while thus mentally engaged,
that Cuthbert heard a well-remembered
voice utter, with a certain undefinable tone
of coarseness and of muffled vulgarity, the
following words,
“Sorry I should have to press you for the
odd hundred.”
Cuthbert started. The import of that
sentence appeared to him to be exceedingly
singular. He saw to whom it was addressed,
and by whom it was uttered. The first
thought which occurred to him he framed
within his own mind somehow thus-
“That animal does not want 'the odd
hundred,' as he calls it. Far from that.
Very queer. . . . And to such a man! I
suppose it is the money for Childering's
chestnut thoroughbred.”

all,
Cuthbert now glanced towards the other
-I mean towards him whom he had men-
tally designated as “ such a man.”
There was not the least irritation in the
face—not the least ; but there was great
disdain—very great disdain. This was not
all. During a single second, a change for
which young Harding could not account,
a change which he could not trace to any
specific physiognomic cause—had come over
the whole carriage and appearance of the
foreigner. A something (it was, I say,
momentary)—a look, an air, as it were, of
authority and of weight, passed that way,
and was gone. Meanwhile, the personage
in question had never been other than ex-
ceedingly cool-perfectly quiet and self-
possessed-phlegmatic, might almost be the
word.
“To-morrow,” he said in a must unsuc-
cessful English accent) " it will be at your
banker's.”

The first speaker here murmured some-
thing which Cuthbert could not distinguish,
but it appeared to have been pronounced in
an apologetic manner.
“Well,” thought Cuthbert, “it may be
bold to come to such a conclusion, but it
does seem to me that the Half Million is a
fool, whoever may say the contrary. A
fellow like that to talk of the odd hundred
in such a case! Why, he ought to have
been glad of it !-ay, or of the odd thou-
sand. He does not know the great game,
after all.”
The two had separated, the fat, pudgy
figure slinking or shuffling off into the
crowd, an accidental Money King; while
the destined King of Men, as Homer has it,
resumed his quick, yet quiet, march upon
the platform. Strange, the juxtaposition-
stranger still the contrast-speedy the sever-
ance, and natural. Between those two there
was some difference, I rather think.

The bell had already rung, and the long-
expected train was in sight, when Cuthbert
heard the second of those two fragmentary
conversations to which reference has been
made.
Outside the little building in which the
waiting-rooms were contrived, and which
now offered a “ thorough light,” by means
of its couple of opposite doors (both open),
a chaise, whirled by a pair of foaming
horses, had drawn up suddenly and violently.
Out of it sprang a low, slight figure, with a
thin Italian face, and a prudent, yet adven-
turous, head, quite bald, who ran through
the two doors to the platform. In a mo-
ment, he was by the side of the promenader,
who, although he had evidently awaited his
arrival (so very nearly too late), showed no
impatience, no joy, no emotion of any kind
or degree.
“A temps !” (“ in time !") said the new

“Et la cassette ? ” inquired the other,
phlegmatically, and in a low voice.
“Ici,” replied the first, touching the breast
pocket of his frock coat.
They passed on while still speaking,
entered a first-class carriage, and were pre-
sently careering towards London.
It has been said that Cuthbert, at this
period, was very weak in his French. There
happened to be, in this brief conversation,
one word which he did not understand.
Mentally, he made a note thereof.
The platform was now as silent and
deserted as it had been, a moment ago,
echoing and thronged.
· There remained but the lounging porters,
and the station master, still griping fast the
hand of his little boy, and darting upon the
chubby face, every quarter of a minute, a
menacing look of love—as who should say,
“This time, thou shan't escape me, thou
darling criminal.”

Cuthbert, for a few moments, stood
musing on the broad flag pavement, under
the bright sunshine of that pleasant morn-
ing in July. He still saw, in his mind, that
brisk march; that upright figure; that
antique head ; that bold and massive, yet
classic jaw; that small, calm, sagacious eye;
a striking combination of features ; and, so
considering, he thought again of what Mr.
Melcombe had said.
“Yes," pondered he, “the Half Million
is but a fool, after all! He can't tell a great
man when he sees him, meets him, deals
with him!
“No ordinary judge is Mr. Melcombe,
though,” pursued he ;“he is an experienced
statesman, and he is a great natural mind
besides; understands the materials, and
understands the man; knows the chances,
and knows him who is to use them. The

look that was he gave my precious Half
Million. Decidedly, the Half Million is a
whole accident."
“ Talking of that gentleman, sir,” here
said the station master, lounging forward,
“you should hear Tewkesbury.”
“What ! Lord Woodburn's huntsman ?”
“Yes, sir; he does go on wonderful.
I'm not much of a politician myself, having
a family ; but Tewkesbury always makes a
point of reading the paper, before ever he
goes to bed, so he is an authority. And I
remember, when the inundations were so
bad in France, a season or two ago, Tewkes-
bury said that Louis Philippe wasn't half a
king. ... 'How so ?' said I. "Why,'
said he, “in the first place, he should show
himself among his people in time of dis-

as ever the door is opened. . . . . ‘But
how can you fight against nature ?' said I.
• What is all life,' said he, but one long
fight against nature ? Look at the Dutch,'
said he ; “if they didn't fight against the
sea, they might as well turn fishes at once ;
and the sea is nature, as much as a river,
isn't it? I've been there,' said Tewkesbury,
‘and I know what I am talking about,' said
he. “When I was out hunting with the
prince,' said he, one day, he sighed (and
he is not a man I can tell you, that sighs to
please himself), because my lord mentioned
the damages done six months before, along
the river Lawyer, in his country. Now it
is a good thing, mind you, when a prince
can be found that will sigh 'cause a people
cries. And, besides, I heard my lord say

times and leisure, all that grief and trouble
could be prevented for the future ; and that
his uncle, the great Emperor, knew how-
ay, and meant to have done it, too.' (You
see, sir, Tewkesbury has read the histories
of Bonaparte, and knows what sort of cattle
the French are.) “But what principally
vexed this prince,' says Tewkesbury, 'was
Louis Philippe not showing himself—at
least, among the poor people, at that un-
fortunate time, and not testifying the good-
will like, if he could do no more.'”.
“And would this man ?” asked Cuthbert.
“That's just what the huntsman says, sir,
Although the prince is anything but rich, he
does wonderful generous things ; and he'll
allow anybody, let him be the poorest
creature going, to come up and speak to
him. Ah ! much more than if they were
well to do, that I do hear !”

“ And so this huntsman thinks that the
person who has the place now is not fit for
it ? ” observed Cuthbert.
Ashby nodded and replied—“And what
is more, that he can't hold it long, sir.
‘Only once give this gentleman a fair
chance,' says he, and you see if he don't
go in and win. He could not hunt like
that in his first season,' says Tewkesbury,

can't judge of. May be, you would under-
stand the matter, sir, being knowledgeable
about books, while I, having a family (be
quiet, Ned, or you shan't get the orange
again), naturally attends to my little
ones.”
“What is it?” asked young Harding.

Ashby,' says he, “that I rests my claims ;

'I am free to tell you, Tewkesbury,' said I,

little ones get bigger, and begin to shift for
themselves.' (That was an excuse of mine,
sir; because he made me feel shamefaced
with his learning). “Well,' said he, did

want to read further ?' “Often,' said I;

“And very remarkable it is,” replied
young Harding. “I would not for fifty
pounds have missed your conversation.”
“I feel greatly flattered, sir, I am sure,”
said Ashby. “I didn't know there was
so much value in what I said.”
“And,” pursued young Harding, “not

“A thousand pounds, sir !” cried the
station master—" that's a mort of money.”

And as he spoke, the master of that
public establishment hurried away to pay
his duty to the great country gentleman

man who honoured his shire and his country,
Cuthbert was left to himself once more.

Nor moving from where he stood, and only
half turning his head, he saw Sir Walter
walk hastily to the telegraph office. Cuth-
bert made up his mind. When Sir Walter
emerged from the office, he met young
Harding face to face.
After the greeting—which, on Sir Walter's
side, was unaffectedly kind; on Cuthbert's
warm and respectful—the young man said,
hesitatingly,
"I was on the point of writing to you,

Sir Walter : will you favour me with half
a minute's private conversation ?”
Sir Walter looked at him attentively, and
replied—
"I was going to drive back by Throstle-
dale; will you get into the carriage ? I
have only my little Henrietta with me.”
“I would sooner you had the whole
petty sessions Bench !” exclaimed Cuthbert,
in sudden alarm. “I mean," added he,
hastily, “so far as mentioning, before her,
the subject on which I would trouble you."
“Oh! Then, as you please,” answered
the baronet, with the least possible look
of surprise, and the greatest possible look of
haughtiness.
It was, however, a haughtiness quite at
home in the impressive and handsome face,
not especially (at least, not consciously)
meant to wither Cuthbert. That young
person was not easily withered, yet he felt
exceedingly uneasy, and taxed his mind

to divine how the exclamation of which he
had been guilty could have given displea-
sure.
That displeasure, as has been hinted, was
not pointed or direct, but vague. It was
of this kind. In Sir Walter Mandeville's
mind, little Henrietta Mandeville was, of
course, nothing to Mr. Cuthbert Harding ;
yet, in Mr. Cuthbert Harding's mind, it
seems, she was something to that young
gentleman-a rather curious notion to so
much as pass through this youth's brain.
Hence the slight surprise, and the great
haughtiness. But the poor lad had small
experience; he was very quick, and would
pick up a due estimate of social relations
soon enough. Hence the kind and even
half tender manner which immediately
succeeded the transient, unconscious glance
of pride.
“Let me give orders,” pursued Sir Walter,
in the mean time, to my coachman.”

"Permit me, first,” said Cuthbert, (sure
as intuition, and rapid as the lightning,
about what he ought to do, yet dark as
Erebus respecting the why)—“permit me,
first, to take my hat off to the—to Miss
Henrietta, and to convey to her the thanks
of my sister.”
And he ran to the carriage—where, grace-
ful, pensive, sat, like a little queen, the fair
child, inebriated with the bright and glorious
sunshine which quivered over the abounding
woods. Her large, dreamy eyes were beaming
with gentle thoughts and fancies in them-
selves poetry, and she seemed rapt, as only
a frail organization can be rapt, by the sole
beauty of the day. The stouter nature
which withstands the depression, is also a
stranger to the cheer of mere atmospheric
influences. There were a thousand infini-
tesimal sounds, characteristic of summer and
of busy morning, blended into an indis-
tinct murmur or hum; the long-continued

roll of the carriage wheels had ceased ; and
the child's ear now reposed upon the soft-
ness of the half silence as upon a pillow ;
her thoughts gliding forth at the invitation
of Guess, to hunt for the perch of the
cuckoo, the rounded melody of whose sono-
rous note came swelling from the neigh-
bouring glades. But he mocked the out-
travelled questing spirit of the sweet
child. He changed his place shamefully ;
he changed it also by enchantment. The
alert imagination flew towards him on the
left; and, lo ! he was now on the right.
Ah ! she would have found him, in the
end, only for Master Cuthbert. She was
so abstracted that she did not perceive
that gentleman at first. She was in chase
of the cuckoo, far away. She did not know
of, she did not think of, what was coming in
life, did she ? that musing little queen-
that dear, graceful child ! How is it, that

look so much more graceful and queen-
like, in the youthful and beautiful mother's
carriage, than that charming mother, despite
the pomp of mastery, the bloom that has
attained its perfection, and the elegance of
fully-taught life knowledge ? Perhaps the
grace here alluded to, and the queenliness of
manner, go with something else. Some-
times they stay till the end; but that is
rare.”
“I am so delighted,” cried Henrietta,
" that the bouquet pleased Winnifrid. If I
knew her favourite flowers, I would ask her
to call them hers.”
After a proper acknowledgment of this,
Cuthbert, who had leant upon the door of
the barouche, withdrew a pace, nodding and
smiling; he then looked at Sir Walter, who
turned to the coachman, and said —
“To Throstledale ; a foot pace. I wish
to speak with Mr. Harding. We will
follow by the carriage road.”

The high-stepping blood bays pranced
round, and bore the light burden of Hen-
rietta and her airy meditations with the
slow majesty of restrained curvetings, and
an impatient walk, to the wood-belted,
bough-fanned, summer road, and along the
trembling fretwork which the shadows of
the green leaves overhead flung upon the
white dust below.
Sir Walter and young Harding followed
at an easy sauntering pace.
“Geoffrey is quite well, I hope, Sir
Walter,” remarked Cuthbert, clearing his
throat.
“Perfectly. He leaves the Duke of
Man's this day."
A silence followed. In half a minute Sir
Walter broke it.
“You wished to speak with me, Mr.
Harding ?” said he, kindly.
Cuthbert felt dizzy. He wished Sir
Walter had been another highwayman,

holding in his hand another long shiny
barrel ; he wished his own present task had
been to tame and conquer another Buce-
phalus ; above all, he wished he had written
the letter.
“Yes,” said he, slowly, while he inwardly
summoned all the energies of his spirit to
the van of the unseen peril—“yes, Sir
Walter ; my father and I, but especially I
myself, have to thank you for a noble
offer.”
“Do not say anything about that,”
returned the princely gentleman. “I was
almost afraid of being guilty of forwardness
or intrusion, should I make the offer. Once
made, it grieves me only that it should not
have been available.”
How was this? Cuthbert felt that the
tone of the conversation was escaping from
him to a great distance—that it was in-
sensibly settling upon a higher level than at
all suited his design.

“Since my father went into trade, he has
been very sensitive- "
“Ah! there it is !” exclaimed Sir Walter.
“I dreaded wounding his honourable sus-
ceptibility. It was my only dread.”
“My father, I fear, Sir Walter, allowed
that inward trouble to be half seen. But
his letter, I assure you, had but one object,
one only object—to show an appreciation
of your goodness to—to his son ; for it was,
after all, I—it was I, who had the good
fortune to excite your generous interest."
“ All well won by your own conduct,”
said the baronet.
“Believe me, Sir Walter,” pursued young
Harding, “that my father, however sensi-
tive, felt no pain whatever blended with
those warm feelings which it was right to
express to you at once-right that you should
hear declared on our part, before any
other word was spoken ; in short, before
I either wrote to you, or requested my

present interview. And it was so done,
therefore."
“I am truly glad,” observed Sir Walter,
" that I have not given pain.”
“Quite impossible," returned Cuthbert.
“Your own delicacy of sentiment was my
father's buckler. You did not come a great
gentleman to a struggling tradesman, and
say to him, in his declining years, “Mr.
William Harding, your brewery wants help
to save you from bankruptcy ; here are
twelve hundred pounds for you !""
Sir Walter started.
“Such a thought never entered my head,”
said he, quickly ; “I spoke but of your
commission in a cavalry regiment.”
“ Exactly, Sir Walter," returned Cuth-
bert. “A cornet's commission would have
cost that sum. Once more, let me assure
you that both I and my father are entirely
without words to express the thanks we
would offer you. It seemed to Mr. Harding

doubtful, whether he ought to permit you
to throw away so immense a sum on the
advancement in life of a lad who was
already paid for having-having-in fine,
for what he did. Paid, that is, by the
joy he felt in that good fortune itself. This
is not pride, Sir Walter,” added Cuthbert,
hastily, “and far less is it insensibility, on
my father's part.”
“Oh !” said the other. “I quite under-
stand. You need not say another word.”
“Nor shall I, about my father,” replied
Cuthbert; “now for myself. The offer was
not made to him; there was no question
about his getting a commission. It was
to me, in a more direct and immediate
manner, that your noble and kind sugges-
tion referred. In any case, my father would
have consulted my wishes entirely; but
here he had, naturally, not even a choice ;
to me accordingly he left the decision. It
is with deep and heartfelt gratitude, after

due reflection, that I accept this offer—on
one condition.”
"Oh, then, you will go into the army ?”
exclaimed the baronet, greatly surprised.
“Not precisely that,” said Cuthbert; “at
least, if I have rightly understood your
wishes. Another, in my place, might at
once have accepted the commission, after
taxing, not merely your purse to buy it, but
also your interest to get it, and then he
might have sold out on the first oppor-
tunity. He would thus, at all events, have
secured something to sell. But I prefer to
be frank with so noble a friend.”
Sir Walter bowed slightly, and said
nothing.
“First, Sir Walter,” resumed Cuthbert,
am I right in supposing that the pecuniary
outlay is not the only one ? that there is
also what I have heard to be at least as
precious, I mean an expenditure of in-
terest ?”

“Pray do not consider that,” returned
Sir Walter. “For the rest, my interest
would lie idle."
Yet Cuthbert had imagined this would
prove a very weighty consideration. As
a general principle, it would. It was by
no means stupid in the youth.
“I am right, then,” responded Cuthbert ;
“ the favour, the service, is just twice as
great as it looks. One other question—was
it not your intention to do me good ? It
was nothing to you what profession I might
follow; that was a matter, in itself, of com-
parative indifference to the benefactor. In
short, your object was not to select my
calling for me, but to show your kindness.”
“I certainly did not mean to dictate your
calling."
When Cuthbert heard this he exclaimed-
“Because I would, to-morrow even, enter
the army (which I abhor), rather than not
prove my gratitude in the best, the only

worthy, manner, by freely and decisively
accepting your munificent offer, Sir Walter ;
and, accordingly, I do now accept it—that
is, on one condition, as I have already said.
This condition is, that you will permit me
to regard the sum in question—the—the
twelve hundred pounds—as a loan. I
happen to have just discovered a means of
turning it to such an account as will straight
found my fortune."
Sir Walter knew he was not dealing with
a fool, who might say and might think this
unreasonably or hastily. He reflected for a
few moments and said
“I will send your father, then, a cheque
this day. Good morning,” added be,
quickly, “and success to you."
Hastily offering his hand, he left Cuth-
bert transfixed in the middle of the road.

King Arthur.
Young Harding had not been long in exe-
cuting the little plan, the formation and
accomplishment of which occupied the close
of our last chapter. But he was far from
considering the transaction “ an operation.”
On the contrary, some operations might now
begin. That was a mere brand saved un-
expectedly out of the burning. That was a
mere affair which had only to be touched,
and it marched of its own accord ; a very
excellent bit of luck, spontaneous and super-
rogatory.

“The old village schoolmaster,” thought
he, “who first taught me to write, before
the grandesse days when Uncle Marlowe
preached himself into a fat rectory, and
took his little unbroken nephew by the
hand, used to say of any pet pen which he
had just made, as he handed it to me-
“there's a pen that will write of itself.' Well,
here was a business which walked of itself.
It walked to Lea Meadows, and my father
was sending it away again. But I had only
to call it back, and, of course, I have called
it, and back it comes. We can't make our
opportunities, can we? But, at least, we

in being inaccessible to their advances. We

damp your good-will. Thank you, dear
father; but if that be the manner in which
you have managed your brewery, no wonder
it has not prospered.”
While thus meditating, he stood still,
looking down upon the dust-white road.
“ An enormous stroke of luck to set out
with,” pursued he, mentally ; "yet, not all
merely luck, neither! That evening, at
Huntingferry, there was as little time as
there is in a battle to think and to act, and
yet I thought and acted. Would everybody
have done the same ? Geoffrey is above the
average, and in what state was he ?”

name for the law of compensation which
rules this world, roughly equalizing the lots
of mortals, and forcing, in a thousand un-

Nemesis, I say, has a persistent, although a
sneaking, regard for her flighty cousin, Luck.

And they who, in prosperity, love to ascribe
little to fortune and much to their own
deserts, either receive at once, each time, a
salutary slap in the face, and are thereby
made wise, or else a tremendous revenge is
kept in reserve for them by the indignant
personage I have mentioned—I mean, by
Nemesis. It is just the contrary in adversity.
Fortune does not like the names people call
her when they are in a scrape, and ten to
one if she do not either keep them there, or
take them out of it to let them find their
way into a worse. Everybody knows (be-
cause Lord Bacon made it new again) the
story of the all-prevailing, all-conquering
old Greek, who became so spoiled and con-
ceited that, one day, in a speech which he
made in the market-place, having recapitu-
lated his various achievements one after the
other, he paused at each to remark—"and
in this also, you perceive—and in this, and
in this—fortune had no share.” No; it was

all his own individual merit. Well, he
never had one turn of luck afterwards. All
went wrong with him in the sequel. Under
his management, from that day forward,
everything failed. He had denied his falli-
bility, and it became forthwith an infallible
characteristic of his. The fact is, that he
spoke too loud ; and, though he thought he
was addressing merely his countrymen, the
Athenians, that sensitive power whom I have
named—the cousin of both good and evil
fortune—the supposed “Nemesis,” over-
heard him. Had he merely thought within
himself what he said aloud, he would have
been similarly overheard.
Cuthbert was not quite so self-worshipful
as he stood on that delightful rural high-
way, notwithstanding the promptitude with
which he had achieved his little plan.
But would it serve to allow this cheque
of which Sir Walter spoke, to reach his
father's hands, or even his father's know-

ledge ? At the very least, young Harding
considered that young Harding ought to be
at home before the cheque arrived.
He was still rooted to the ground in pro-
found thought, when he felt as if a spear
had pierced his back. Yet it was only the
light, kind arm of Sir Walter Mandeville,
who had returned, and had touched him on
the shoulder.
“I was wounded last night by a high-
wayman,” said Cuthbert, as an apology for
the sharp cry which had involuntarily es-
caped him.
“Really, I hope I have not hurt you. I
should like much to hear the story of your
adventure. My motive in coming back is
to offer you a seat in the barouche, if you
are going my way.”
“Thanks, many thanks,” said Cuthbert ;
“ but I expect a telegraph message from
London, and I cannot well leave this neigh-
bourhood till it arrives.”

“Ah !” replied Sir Walter, smiling, “and
it was to send one I came. It rains the
same kind of rain, at about the same time,
for a good number of persons, over a given
space. The world is not so big as it seems.”
Cuthbert stared. Each of the two last
remarks would have required a long com-
ment to do the sense of it justice, or, at
least, to put it into language on a level
with the ordinary style of thinking. Each
of the observations was a little book.
They were yet in conversation, when Sir
Walter, whose face looked up the road in
the direction of the sun, shaded his eyes
with his hand. Cuthbert turned. A horse-
man was approaching at a slow pace. About
fifty yards behind rode a servant on a much
better steed, as is often the case, when the
master has reached “the grand climacteric.”

himself, unless he chance to be like our
brilliant friend Algernon's father, Mr. Otway
Childering, takes a pride rather in mounting
his groom well. “Notice this animal,”
would the youth say to you, if he spoke
his thought. “Observe that animal,” is all
the senior would demand.
“Why, that is Mr. Rosebriar !” exclaimed
Sir Walter, “and I have been supposing
that he was in London.”
The interjection partook more of the
nature of a soliloquy than of conversation ;
and, at this moment, the subject of it came
up.
His appearance was somewhat remarkable.
He wore a white hat, a green coat (the
buttons cloth-covered), and wide nankeen
trousers. It was evident, at a glance, that
he was what is called “well off,” if not
opulent; probably, had a country establish-
ment somewhere near. The dress, the horses,
the groom following him, the leisurely pace,

were all a large handbill for this sort of
conclusion. But it was a very rudimentary,
alphabetic, first-thought view—it was, in
short, what anybody would say at once.
Cuthbert saw all this; and yet, as though
there were still something else less legible
about the man, he kept his eyes fastened
on him while he exchanged greetings with
Sir Walter Mandeville.
Mr. Rosebriar, as the baronet had called
him, looked about forty; a little less, or
a little more. He was a spare person, with
a pale countenance, in which might be
traced a peculiar expression. “Anxious”
would be too strong a word for it. The
eyes had a certain eagerness in their gaze,
and every now and then a character of
hesitation flitted over the physiognomy. It
was what might be termed an educated
face, and not deficient in elegance or refine-
ment. The individual was far from having
the air of a fool, and he had not the talk

of a fool. Yet something exceedingly un-
pleasant (to Cuthbert's mind) resulted from
the combination of that eager—nay, almost
hungry, look about the eyes, with that
transient but frequent evidence of a hesi-
tating or faltering disposition, which, as I
have said, crossed the features, rather than
stayed there.
“A sharp and clever mind,” said young
Harding to himself, “ but still a weak one ;
and, as to the moral part, is it that he
is a coward ? Not, perhaps, in the most
obvious sense. Somewhere, however, I feel
convinced, he has a dinted and battered
place in the daily life armour-battered into
holes, probably. A weak man at heart, I
am certain ”
Such was the reading of this individual
come to very quickly by Master Cuthbert,
who was not a learned young gentleman,
but men were his books. And the—no,
not uneasy, but--eager, hungry eye of the

opulent stranger, whose groom had halted
fifty yards off, played occasionally over
Cuthbert, while the possessor of that eye
chatted with Sir Walter.
“What a contrast,” thought Cuthbert,
" to the foreigner I just now saw on the
platform of the railway! what a contrast
especially in this one particular—the settled
keen eye and the hesitating keen eye—the
conscious strength and steadfast greatness
of the look, and this periodical look of
littleness, or feebleness, or something very
like it !”
Cuthbert continued thus to muse, acutely
idle, observantly at rest.
And the eager, hungry eye perused him
again and again, as the subject of his
meditation still conversed with Sir Walter.
“Yes, Sir Walter,” he said, in reply to
something, “it is a change since you and
I were at the university together. But I

gentleman's life. Yet, on the other hand,
the iron factory does not suit me either.
Not that it has failed in my management.
I have nothing to complain of. But I wash
my hands of business now. That is, for
the present. I have got the capital safe
out of it again, after paying me full eight
per cent. for these several years. It was
a good thing."
“Why quit it?" asked the baronet, smiling.
“Well,” said the other, “I am tired of
it. One never knows what may happen.
A man has been looking at it. He of the
Limes—the man, Brompton--"
Cuthbert felt at once interested by this
name.
“A sure bidder. Selfish, clever, shrewd
man!” pursued the stranger. “Would not
give a penny over anything's price. Well,
he said he would pay positively more than
I even thought the business would have
fetched.”

“A good proof,” observed Sir Walter,
“ that it is worth staying in.”
“But a good opportunity for leaving it,
eh?” replied the other. “It was this busi-
ness which brought me from town in such a
hurry. I have seen this man Brompton ;
he is a maid of all work, by-the-by, collects
the beauty's rents in Cumberland for Dr.
Harding—-"
Cuthbert started,
The eager, hungry eye surveyed him.
The beauty! Who but one ?
“I asked him, was it true," continued the
possessor of that eye, “ that he wished to get
the factory, “Yes,' said he, “if the price
suited him. I named the one which I had
been informed he was ready to give. I had
been misinformed. He told me that he
would not have himself quoted as a person
of two bids,' that was his phrase ; that he
had already been heard to say what sum
he would give, and by that sum he would

abide.' Eccentric old chap! And he actually
proffered me a higher amount, higher by
four hundred pounds. Not much in thou-
sands, you know, Sir Walter. But still, there
it was ; a better offer than the offer which
was better than my own expectations !”
“I suppose," remarked Sir Walter, “that
Mr. Brompton sees how to make the busi-
ness more profitable than you ever were
able to render it yourself.”
“No doubt,” responded the stranger, with
a frown ; and as he mused, his eager,
hungry eye fluttered again around Cuthbert,
like a bird that would not settle.
At the same time, Cuthbert noticed an
amused expression in the countenance of Sir
Walter, who now said —
“Of course, as you came from town ex-
pressely to secure even a smaller price than
that which was thus placed so handsomely
within your reach, you instantaneously closed
with this man's offer ?”

“Oh! dear me, no,” replied the other.
“ What do you take me for ?"
“ Why not?” asked Sir Walter.
“Well, one never knows, you know,” said
Mr. Rosebriar.
And the hungry, eager eye devoured
vacancy.
Sir Walter smiled.
“How is my— ” demanded Mr. Rose-
briar.
Cuthbert did not catch the last word; for
while the speaker hesitated and hummed,
hand on chin, in an absent way, the baronet
answered him at once by-
“Quite well. There she is, in the car-
riage.”
Sir Walter Mandeville now nodded to
Cuthbert cheerfully; and saying, “ Your
father shall hear from me to-morrow,”
walked by the side of the stranger's horse,
which moved forward at a foot pace, in the
direction of the carriage.

That “to-morrow” was an inexpressible
relief to Cuthbert. He had resolved to give
orders at the station to forward the tele-
graphic message at once to Lea Meadows ;
and he had intended himself forthwith, in
order to gain the same destination, to re-
mount the gig, and to command Mr. Harry
Panton to extract something more of action
from the tranquil Bessy; which enjoinder
failing, he would take the reins in his own
hands. It would never do, he reflected, to
let Sir Walter's letter be received by Mr.
William Harding, unapprised, unexpected.
It might not even answer to let him receive
it at all. But that could be settled by inter-
mediate consideration. However, as affairs
had turned out, there was no longer any
need to hasten thus his own flight home
again. His excellent father would not (for
this day at least) have the opportunity of
sending good luck from the door, when good
luck came so courteously of its own accord.

This point determined, his thoughts took
another turn. “Mr. Sweetbriar's what?”
wondered Cuthbert. “What was it of his
that this anxious-faced gentleman factory
owner called the sweet child ? What is
Henrietta Mandeville to him ? Well, and
what is that to me ? ”.
He tried now to dismiss the whole matter
from his mind. He felt rather weak, and,
as the heat was sensibly increasing, he sat
down on the mossy bank by the side of the
road, under a beautifully spreading, magnifi-
cent horse-chestnut tree. Once out of the
direct blaze, the sunshine appeared to him
only the more glorious.
He had secured twelve hundred pounds,
besides the two hundred which he expected
for his shares. Ah! it was heavenly
weather. How pleasant the rustle of the
leaves, how mellow the note of the mys-
terious cuckoo whose position had puzzled
Henrietta, how sweet and balmy the air,

how fragrant the wild violets, or something
-how, how_fourteen hundred !-why it
was a landscape, a climate—fourteen hun-
dred, and then what his father would give
him! Oh, what could be more picturesque
than the outlines of yonder windmill ?
And, look up, what a bower the horse-chest-
nut tree made overhead ! Probably, in all,
two thousand, two thousand to begin with ;
think of that, and see wbat endings he
would obtain from such beginnings ! Ah!
that mingled song of many birds, those
sylvan lights and shadows, that lacework of
the twigs in the great branching vault
above him. All nature was at peace, wasn't
she? More ; she was at holiday. What
beauty of aspect, what breathing joy every
where around, what harmony of gentle
sounds, from the insects in the grass, to the
feathered wanderers of the middle sky ?
Earth seemed heaven, or heaven was on
earth.

But a change came o'er the spirit of his
dream. He now began to ponder on the
queer trick which Mr. Bradworth had played
him; taking the whole amount on each
share, instead of the professed deposit, or
earnest, of a quarter the amount. To Cuth-
bert it was, in regard to profit, exactly and
strictly the same thing. The shares were
now at a premium, and he could not have
realized a fraction more than that premium,
whatever it was, whether the shares were
paid-up shares or otherwise. The only dif-
ference was, that the odd ninety-five pounds
had passed the interval in Mr. Bradworth's
pocket-book, instead of in Cuthbert's. Had
Cuthbert paid only the deposit for five shares
(that is, thirty pounds), he would now be
entitled, on selling, to fully as much as he
was actually to receive.
“Hollo !” cried he, suddenly, “there is
some confusion here ! Very true; had
merely the deposit for five shares been taken,
39


## p. 34 (#42) ##############################################

34

I should now get as much as I shall get.
But why take the whole amount, and tell
me it was but a deposit--nay, insist so
much on his own kindness in being prepared
to 'stump up for me, as he elegantly said ?
Was it that he wanted to make the favour
appear the greater, when he was actually
doing for me much less than he had it in
his power to do? Ah! I'll be even with
you some day, Mr. Bradworth! I'll be even
with you! That sum, even by your own
emphasis respecting the duty of being ready
to pay up, was really but a deposit, and
entitled me to twenty shares instead of
five !”
And, as he leaned, with the unwounded
shoulder, against the horse chestnut tree,
looking extremely calm, there was yet some-
thing in his glittering eye which a judge of
character would not have relished, would
not have complimented himself on having
provoked.

“But it is inexplicable—it is as dark as

is a pitch black puzzle! What motive could
he have had ? A millionaire ! Why, it is
as if I were to put my hand in a child's
pocket to steal his gingerbread nuts, after
dining at Sir Walter Mandeville's! What
are the odd fifteen shares, at six pounds five
per share deposit, to the man who, at this
moment, can manufacture almost as many
as he likes with a scrape of his pen ? No,
no, no; it is too absurd.”
While he thus pondered, he opened his
pocket-book and took out the scrip, which
he had never once thought it worth while to
examine.
He uttered an abrupt exclamation. There
they were, staring him in the face-twenty
shares.
“Ah! to be sure,” said he. “A deposit
of six pounds five shillings the share. Then,

Was he quizzing me? Only think of that!
He thought it an exquisite piece of fun that
he should assume, even for argument's sake,
the possibility of his paying anything for a
young cub fresh from Eton. Ah! well—no
matter; he has acted handsomely by me; he
is welcome to his wit. He would, by-the-
by, have had much more to pay than he
said—if the shares were below par this day
-only, in that case, he would not have paid
-that's true! It was on theory, as he re-
marked. Exquisite fun! There would
not be any occasion, you know,' said he.
Charming! And he would not even take
the trouble to enlighten me as to the num-
ber of shares by which I was enriched, nor
the extent of this theoretic liability of his.
No; he left me in the muddle in which he
found me. Doubtless, it was a treat to him
to contemplate my exultant simplicity ; he
would not disturb it for the world. It was

a pleasing picture of innocence to his mind.
And I bragging about my betting-book at
Eton! The book's the man, sir, is it?'
Why, he was laughing at me! I thought
I noticed something equivocal about his
sniggle. But, never mind, that book was
a reality, for all the magnificent and pitying
calmness of his sneer. That book procured
me these shares, and these shares shall pro-
cure me thousands upon thousands—and
that is but a beginning. So, don't be in
a hurry, dear Mr. Bradworth, to sniggle
superior. You are sixty-I am not twenty.
Before I am half your age, I'll undertake to
buy you and all you are worth in the morn-
ing, and not count it into my day's work,
when I tot it up at night. The man who
saves pennies and the man who makes
pounds are two. We both belong to the
latter kind, with a difference.”

pleased—nay, seriously and deeply indig-

nant. “Thou knowest,” said Hannibal's
brother, Asdrubal, to Hannibal. “how to
gain, but not how to use, a victory.” This,
indeed, was for stopping too soon in the
midst of success; but there are others
equally misled in not knowing where to
stop.
“Besides,” pursued Cuthbert, in the un-
wonted exhilaration and self-glorying of his
thoughts, “who would have Mr. Bradworth's
money to be Mr. Bradworth? A pretty
chance his for an Emily Whitsund's hand-
ay, or for any real social distinction what-
ever! Take him at any age. 'Tis true,
they worshipped as he walked—but what ?
It is true, he toddles and stumps about as
though a divinity. But look at him in the
House of Commons !—look even behind him
as he struts past you in a great private
house. The very menials feel their superi-
ority, and giggle. He turns—they are de-
corous. He retires—they are obstreperous.

He looks at them—they are black in the
face. He turns away—they relieve them-
selves in a burst of unanimous and genuine
derision. If he speaks, they choke ; when
he is gone, they roar with laughter, and so
save their lives. And if he is not for him-
self, nor with sincerity, admired or respected
-is he loved? And yet why not, poor
man? He is not a bad fellow; he has
given me the twenty shares.”
Cuthbert thus mused, and, as he mused,
a name continued to buzz in his ears like an
air of music which a person wishes to brush
out of his head in vain. This happens to
people every day; but, generally, the indi-
vidual haunted by the importunate recollec-
tion is not in his most robust state of health
at the time. Sometimes it is an air of
music, as I have said, or part of one, the
fag end of a tune; often it is a word, a
proverb; somebody's remarkable, or not re-
markable, exclamation; sometimes it is a

name. Cuthbert was rendered less insensible
to these troublesome little impressions by
the weakness consequent on the effusion of
blood from his shoulder. It is the more
singular that he should, at present, be fol-
lowed by the fluttering and the buzzing of
this name in particular, because he had it
wrong in his memory. It was the name of
Mr. Rosebriar. This person he—or rather,
that other self whom we all have inside of
us, and whom De Maistre, in his wonderful
“ Journey round my Room,” actually termis
“ť’Other” (l'Autre)—this person, I say,
Cuthbert or Cuthbert's other self, persisted
in calling Sweetbriar—“Mr. Sweetbriar.”
And, at intervals, during the whole time of
the musing which has been related, this
name, “Sweetbriar, Mr. Sweetbriar,” con-
tinued to hammer upon the tympanum of
his mind's ear. (The mind may as well be
said to have an ear, I suppose, as to have
an eye.)

“How is it,” thought Cuthbert, “ that
Sir Walter never introduced me, although
I was standing there, during their conversa-
tion? I presume, such is the way in these
great circles. Well, hang this Sweetbriar !
what is he to me? I'll get him out of my
head ; the name keeps buzzing at me like
a gadfly."
He was as good as his word. By a
powerful effort of his will, he fairly dashed
that gadily, as he called it, aside; and it
was a very long time—it was several years
-before he again heard that name, or one
which it resembled. When he did, he vainly
strove to recall the present hour. It was too
deeply packed down and heaped over by the
lumber and the mass of intervening events
and later transactions, to come forth from
its little hiding-place at the call of a jaded
and weary memory.

CHAPTER III.
“My lord, I answered, with unquailing brow,
Not to such ears should youth its faults avow."
New Timon.
A VERY curious case of eavesdropping
occurred that morning, before young Hard-
ing went for his telegraphic message.
With a start, Cuthbert now looked at his
watch, and, of course, found it still “ the
same drunk,” the same three o'clock. It
was more easily restored than its master
would have been, if he had similarly stopped.
While winding it at leisure, before returning
to the station for Falconer's answer, Cuthbert
reviewed the circumstances which the casual
disablement of his watch naturally recalled.

“Although,” thought he, “the face of
that handsome fellow who saved the station-
master's child just now, seemed not wholly
strange to me, yet it is, ten to one, only my
fancy. I could not have had a good view
of the youth who, last night, saved me. I
do not know that there is here but one and
the same individual; they are two distinct
persons probably, nor can I even be sure,
again, that either of them is this Algernon.
It, certainly, would be like a rebuke to me
from-from something unseen, were he who
has preserved my life to be the very person
whose life I swore to have.”
He rose and sauntered slowly back to-
wards the station, along the shaded road,
his hands crossed behind him, in the manner
in which he had seen Mr. Bradworth cross
his. This was not by way of imitating the
illustrious man, but because that carriage
happened to be the least painful.
“Surely,” thought young Harding, as he

thus advanced," he cannot have had the
luck to save from violent death two lives
in succession within twenty-four hours.
That would be strange! And yet, as Sir
Walter says, it rains the same kind of rain,
et cetera. This would make him twice as
great a favourite with Emily.”
Cuthbert looked about him, as one does in
expectation of a shower.
“It seems not to be such delicious weather
as it was a few minutes ago,” thought he.
“Everything was then so balmy; it is less
bright, less delicious, or something. This
youngster appears to be born to eclipse me.
Ah ! there is one thing, at least, in which
he shall be himself eclipsed ; one thing in
which men shall talk of Harding, not of
Childering ; one thing wherein I shall have
no rival of that sort. Power is the lady to
woo, and there is no power like money ; in
able hands, that is. Power is the lady to
wed; the power of money-in the right

hands—can accomplish anything. We are
sordid, forsooth, if we value money above
intellectual gifts ; yet how, and for what,
are we ourselves valued by those who tell us
of the difference? They are right who tell
us so—and they don't know it, the hypo-
crites! They are right, and they don't
know it. Intellectual gifts may, indeed, be
more worth and more mighty than money
--for, by their own prostitution, they can
even command it. But what do these
canters and dolts mean? Do they mean
that they value intellectual gifts as much as
they value money’s condition, money's ap-
purtenances, money's very appearance ? No;
for when they see wealth, they at once fall
down and worship, no matter even if it be
marked by the glaring want of everything
else ; nor dare they let the vile rich man
know that they complain of him for doing
just what they do themselves, that is for
valuing those riches which render him, not,

indeed, adorable, but still adored. No ; it
is of him who has yet to gain his money that
they complain ; it is against him that they
cry out, if he show any tendency to prefer
wealth to these other things of which they
speak; and thus, if he be a coward, they
keep him from ever becoming an object of
their own cult. Because he is poor, they
call shame on him, that he should be so
anxious to get rich : while, if he is fool
enough to listen to them, they despise him
all his life. But suppose he be wise enough
to disdain them, they make a god of him for
his sage contempt of them—for nothing less,
for nothing more—and never call shame on
him after. Ah! vile crew of self-deceiving
canters, I know the bride to woo: yes, Uncle
Marlowe, leader of that crew! and I know
the other bride whom you would then fling
into my arms—although for a morganatic
match, so far as the priority of the heart's
regard would be involved.”

Cuthbert had come to speak aloud, and
he was overheard, though he knew it not.
“I had not thus regarded my radiant-
minded Emily, uncle, till you taught me, by
that cruel, that unprovoked, that public
insult, so, even so, to regard her : yes, that
worst form of insult, cruellest species of
publicity; insult before her, publicity before
my school friend, my little sister, my father,
my mother, and the lady who was plighted
to me and whom I loved. And he a scholar,
and he a Christian, and he a divine ! Divine,
indeed! He told me that I was not one of
those persons whose love was a favour to the
object of it—that these grand hopes, or self
flatteries, should be left to those youths who
are rich ; yet, he is all for the intellectual
and the inward above the accidental and the
external! No! arrogant, self-deceiving can-
ter, you are not. If, abounding in treasures,

for decorously contrived, but practical and
real, money value, I can, and do, 'purchase

maiden will be too good then to reward the
bold and able sinner's sin ; you who gave
your conscience for your rectory, will readily
give fifty fair wards for your bishopric.”
“Ahem !” was sonorously uttered close to
Cuthbert's ear.
The young man, without starting in the
least, turned with a cold and haughty
countenance, and beheld his uncle, whose
presence he had previously noticed upon the
platform of the railway.
“You forget the old proverb, nephew,
that trees have ears."
“Pardon me, Uncle Marlowe, I knew that
you were somewhere about,” replied Cuth-
bert, with quite a lofty look of self-pos-
session. “If you mean that you are the
tree who have ears, I divined your presence.”

“ I should not have thought it, nephew,
from the few broken words I caught,” fal-
tered the great preacher.
“You are fond of a classical reference,”
said his nephew, “and, therefore, I may
inform you that, like Socrates, I have a
demon, or familiar, who whispers to me all
sorts of odd information.”
“Well, jests apart, how is it I meet you
here to-day ?”
“That is a secret of state, uncle. When
you begin to take a more indulgent sort of
interest in me, you shall know more. At
present, you are austere; as befits, no
doubt.”
“You are still angry with me,” said Dr.
Harding, “for my hard, but well-meant,
words a week ago, Cuthbert. But I have a
sacred duty to discharge, not only towards
yourself, but towards the orphan entrusted
to my care by a brave soldier who is no more.”

certain easy emphasis and a most peculiar
expression, you distinctly told me on that
occasion, that I had not the same right to
form an attachment to your ward, or to
seek to obtain an interest in her heart, as I
might have if my circumstances happened
to be different from what they are.”
“Well, I did,” replied Dr. Harding ; “I
certainly said that, and say it still.”
“If I understand you rightly,” continued
Cuthbert, “ a large fortune in my possession
would have quite altered the case ?”
“Indubitably,” responded the divine. “ Is
it not plain to your own good sense ?”
“ Had I a few hundreds of thousands, for
example," persisted Cuthbert, “or even much
less, that fact would have made all the
difference?”
“Why, of course !” exclaimed Dr. Hard-
ing. “It is self-evident.”
“Now,” said Cuthbert, “I fully agree
with you, uncle. It would have made a

great difference in your conduct. What
difference it might have made in Emily's, I
know not. But there is a third difference
which it would have made, and would yet
make, if it ever came about; I speak of a
difference in myself.”
“In yourself?” said the doctor; “in your
position, you mean?”
“Yes, and in myself,” urged Cuthbert.
“Don't you know what the difference will
be if I ever become a very rich man?”
“I am not sure that I see your meaning,”
replied the rector.
“Will you let me explain it to you?"
asked Cuthbert, gay in manner, and fierce at
heart.
“By all means,” said Dr. Harding.
"I should be still the same individual,
you know,” resumed the young man; “I
should be still Cuthbert Harding, my own
identical self, and your nephew. I should
have the same qualities and character, unless

they were spoilt, that is; and the same
capabilities, or talents, or intellectual gifts,
only they will have been prostituted. The
same character, but probably spoilt; the
same gifts, only prostituted. Do you see?
The whole difference would amount to this
--moral corruption and intellectual prosti-
tution.”
Dr. Harding seemed to be shocked, for
Cuthbert here came to a dead pause.
“No, there would be the positive fact of
the position,” retorted he, alive now to the
subtle play of a weapon whose point had
been kept so level with his eye, that he had
discovered it with difficulty ; “the position,
the position, nephew !”
“Marry your ward to “a position,' then,”
cried Cuthbert, “and see will it love her,
cherish her, and keep its vows, or she hers!
That is a truly Christian marriage! Let
her love the position,' as I must love the
position’; that is a truly Christian love!

Happiness must be sought therein, both here
and hereafter. I will come any time, and
listen to you expounding that doctrine. My
station was not degraded. It would have
warranted the modest ambition of my at-
tachment. But I owe you Eton, uncle-
Eton and loftier thoughts. A rustic brewer's
son, I have been brought up with opulence
and heirship at each elbow. I have been
introduced to comparisons, and the com-
parisons instilled into me the noble discon-
tent which I still, however, combated and
would have quelled. You have revived it
in full force. I shall combat it no longer.
I will better my 'position.””
“Right, dear nephew,” cried the en-
chanted divine. “ Those are the sentiments
you must cherish. You must climb to an
equality with the youths whom, for that
very purpose, I took care you should know,
and amid whom you should pass your most
ductile and impressionable years.”

“ Climb! yes, climb ! ” cried Cuthbert,
who was now so out of himself that he
checked his walk, stood stock-still upon
the road, and turned full upon the divine.
“You say, climb. It is the proper word.
They are on the level of which you speak
without climbing, and without leaving be-
hind them, in order to climb, any suitable
modest attachments they may have formed,
or may form. I, too, was on a similar level,
somewhat lower down. But they move
quietly on theirs ; I must quit mine, urged
by the aspiring passion you wish to see me
obey. That passion, rest assured, will swing
a heavier weight and a clumsier escalader
than I am to the required elevation. But
will you stop the movement then? Is that
the law of the passions ? They are strong,
Uncle Marlowe, and they come when sum-
moned, and perform mighty things. Do
they go when told ? and when the first task
is done? Answer me that. You will land

me, you think, a few steps higher than I
now stand, among a class who are there
seen moving just a little above our present
position. But, remember this, they move
there in liberty ; I shall reach them in the
gripe of a powerful passion, which will have
hauled me into the midst of them by the
neck. And then, I suppose, I must shake
myself free; compose my ruffled garments ;
and, like the rest, walk about at ease, with
my hands in my pockets. And what of the
thing which brought me? Will it let go its
hold ? Shall I be like the rest, who have
thrown away no love of their sincerer days
to attain that envied grade ? who have cast
themselves into the arms of no strong pas-
sion, or rather devil, to transport them to
that height? Shall I be like the rest, I
ask you? Or shall I have no wages to pay
to my strenuous carrier ? Shall I be im-
mediately released by the gentle force which
bore me upwards? Or shall I be dashed,

ay, dashed, down again on the further
side ?"
Cuthbert shuddered a moment from head
to foot, and then, ere the rector could reply,
continued, with vehemence-
“I'll tell you exactly how it is, uncle. I
give you your choice of the alternatives ;
either everything you value in a person is
out of the person (the very dross of the
earth, for gaining which alone his gifts are
worth anything)—or else, when I am rich,
you will find me with precisely the qualities
and gifts I at this moment possess, the dif-
ference of having prostituted them consti-
tuting the sole exception. Cuthbert Har-
ding will still be Cuthbert Harding, intel-
lectually; but there will be this material
and this moral change wrought by the
direction of his intellectual efforts, that he
was once an honourable youth, possessing
a modest competency, and the fair prospects
of a decent independence, whereas now he
has become base, wealthy, and adored.”

“Upon my word,” said Doctor Marlowe,
“you quite overwhelm me !”
“No, no," retorted Cuthbert; "you are
not easily overwhelmed, Uncle Marlowe.
You have more practice in words than I
have, or ever shall have. It is truth over-
whelms you. It is truth and plain simpli-
city. But do not be alarmed. Hark you !
I will gratify you. I will follow your pre-
cepts. I will take to heart the lesson you
have given me. That silly language, as
you necessarily deem it, that language of
romance, I will never use more. You shall
never blush again for your nephew as for
a poor, ingenuous enthusiast. No! no !
take care you never grieve for him, as for
something else.”
“Come, come, dear nephew, enough of
this !” said Doctor Harding with a strange
little pit-a-pat about his heart—a palpitation
to which that organ had been long unused.
“Yes, and more than enough,” returned

Cuthbert. “I have a bride in London
whom I am going to woo, and whom I
will as surely win and wed as I have wooed
and lost the fair and matchless Emily.”
“ Then you resign her, you resign
Emily ?” cried Doctor Harding, overjoyed.
“Not so fast, uncle. I will tell her so,
if I do. It will not be yet.”
“But if there be a lady in London whom
you are going to marry— ” remonstrated
the scandalized rector.
“Ah! that is a mental marriage,” ob-
served Cuthbert, seriously; “I spoke figura-
tively. It was to a plan of life I alluded.”
“Hum !” said the doctor ; and “hum ! ”
said the doctor, again.
Then, suddenly, with a view, in part to
change the topic to some other more plea-
sant–in part to solve a problem which was
making his curiosity itch, he said —
“I saw you with Sir Walter Mandeville,
just now, as I approached. But he departed,

and I sat down to cool myself. What could
you and Sir Walter be talking about ?”
This was precisely what Cuthbert would
not have wished the doctor even to guess.
“About my battle and my wound, to
be sure," replied he, hardily. “I was telling
him how I was waylaid ; indeed he asked
me, for he had heard something of it al-
ready.”
“ Battle ! wound! waylaid ! When?
where ?” cried Dr. Harding.
“ Last night at eleven o'clock, for the
when,” replied Cuthbert. “And as to the
where, I am quite at a loss whether I should
answer your affectionately solicitous inquiry
by saying it was on the Throstledale high-
way; or in the left shoulder, along the
bladebone."
“Bless my heart !” cried the doctor,
staring at his nephew.
“Amen!” said Cuthbert, “if it needs a
blessing."

“ And pray,” continued the astonished
divine, “how came you to be on the
Throstledale highway at that extraordinary
hour ?"
“ It is not an extraordinary hour, believe
me, uncle,” replied Cuthbert. It is an hour
which recurs regularly every night, and
has been as punctual in its appointed ar-
rival as any hour for the last five thousand
years and odd.”
“What a youngster you are !” said the
doctor, coaxingly. “But, in fine, what
brought you out so far from home, so late
at night ?”
“The flickering up of an expiring flame
in the socket,” returned Cuthbert. “The
last flare of a romantic attachment, ere I
blew it out-poof! I was there to com-
plain to the moon, with the moping owl. I
was there to write a sonnet to my mistress's
eyebrow.”
"Well, and very likely too,” replied

Doctor Harding. “I consider that you
were a moon's minion for some such pur-
pose. Will you dine with me this evening,

Cuthbert started, with a look of surprise
and pleasure.
“I am quite alone,” continued the doctor;
"Emily. and her aunt are gone to the sea.
The poor girl is not well—ahem! I am
quite alone.”
Cuthbert excused himself coldly.
“ As they were about to separate in oppo-
site directions, the one continuing his walk
to the station, the other going towards
Throstledale, young Harding turned round,
and said
“You know French, don't you, uncle ?”
“ Umph! not as well as Greek. Why do
you ask ?"
“Only a word, the meaning of which
I wanted. But it don't matter. Good-
bye."

FALCONER’S answer was lying ready for
young Harding when he re-entered the
station of the electric telegraph. Retiring
to a solitary bench in the corner of the
little wooden room, he read the dispatch.
Rather long, and yet couched in that concise
style which the necessity of paying sepa-
rately and singly for every word naturally
teaches to the most diffuse correspondent.
It ran in these terms :-

was reason for the frown of cogitation, at
least, if not for that of anger.

coner laconically says--refused to have any-
thing to do with it to-morrow. What does
this mean but the expectation of a further
rise ?—the eager resolve to close at once ?
Perhaps, had Falconer waited for the actual
receipt of the shares from me, as a less
friendly fellow would indubitably have
waited, I might have netted a hundred
pounds more to-morrow. But who knows?
This, at least, suffices as it is, and it is
charming. Four hundred on my shares, my
own hundred and twenty-five back; five
hundred and twenty-five. With Sir Walter's
money, seventeen hundred odd. When my

is what he professes to be, scarcely solvent

a brief space, and I will make him solvent
enough)—why, it cannot mount up to less

So much for the fifty pounds I had at Eton,

in my own fashion. Item, rode into Sir
Walter's munificent gratitude on the same
occasion, and by the self-same neck-or-all-

He rose with quite the contrary idea, and,
as he sauntered forth towards the Railway
Whistle, he muttered-
“Now I will begin. Morning's business,
indeed!”
In the station yard his eye was caught by
something about the appearance of a man,
mounted on a powerful brown mare, who
seemed to be waiting for a train, the ap-
proach of which from London was even then
audible. This man appeared to be about
sixty. He was of low stature, so far as
could be judged while he sat in the saddle ;
and the legs, though not long absolutely,
were long relatively to the height of the
trunk. He was very spare and light of
person ; the complexion bronzed; the eye
bright and calm, but with something cun-
ning, or, in other words, little in its expres-

sion, despite the unquestionable sagacity
which was its general character. What
is meant here is, that a good critic in these
matters, an enlightened and just observer,
would be likely to say—“ that would be
a very able, only that he is probably an
over-reaching, man.”
Cunning stifles genius, it need scarce be
said ; but even that ruder power, called
ability, is killed by trickiness.
The trace of this, although scarcely per-
ceptible, Cuthbert detected, in what he
admired otherwise as a firm and able coun-
tenance. Still young Harding was interested
in the equestrian by another circumstance-
by a small circumstance in itself; but it was
a link in the common, not the statute, free-
masonry of congenial tastes.
The man, as has been stated, was mounted
upon a powerful brown mare, and how he sat
on the saddle! Ah! it was singular. You
would imagine that this man knew nothing

about riding, and you would be right that
he cared nothing about the high manège, so
reckless, clumsy, ungainly, lolling, lazy, un-
balanced, seemed his seat. “He cannot
ride,” you would say. Can he not? There
was not a horse within the four seas of
Britain which could throw that rider, fully
awake as he was now, or half asleep as he
sometimes was when thundering late at
night, with furious speed, to his newly pur-
chased home, at the Limes.
It was not Cuthbert, but you, reader, if not
to the manner born, who were supposed to
have said just now, “that man cannot ride.”
Cuthbert knew better, or, at least, thought
otherwise, as he contemplated the spare,
light figure.
Cuthbert had wished to pass on, but a
little group was in his way ; and, before he
had threaded it, his attention had been fixed,
for a few moments, in the way which has
been mentioned.

The old man had one foot dangling care-
lessly out of the stirrup; he wore spectacles;
and, as his “ roadster” began to fret and
fidget at the first distant rumble of the
approaching train, he began, while swayed
up and down, hither and thither, like a per-
son seated in a boat on trembling water, to
read a letter which he had taken out of his
pocket.
When he had satisfied his mind respecting
what he sought in that letter, his eyes, as he
raised his head, lighted on Cuthbert, who
was attentively regarding him.
He repaid the scrutiny with interest; and
Cuthbert, in order to disembarrass himself of
the consequent awkwardness, would have
addressed some casual remark of civility to
the horseman, and so passed on, only for an
incident which gave him a multitude of
companions in his offence (if offence there
was); in other words, drew the eyes of all
present towards the same individual,

What took place at that moment was simple
enough, and not tragical. But it was pre-
cisely this which made the wonder of the
spectators, and indeed, the wonder of the
spectacle. If there had been a catastrophe,
they would have all stared, of course : they
now stared because there was none. “There
is something not wholly disagreeable to us,”
says the amiable French moralist—or liar-
“in the misfortunes of our dearest friends."
And so there is something which fixes our
involuntary interest in the good luck or the
address of our worst enemies. The little old

friends there, or, in truth, elsewhere, yet all
eyes were turned towards him, at present,
with much interest and with one accord.
It has been said that, just as his steed be-
came fidgety, he had begun to read a letter,
having one foot out of, and one foot in, the
stirrup, his spectacles on his nose. The
letter he held in his right hand; the reins
he clutched, with a negligent-looking grasp,
in his left. The train approached rapidly ;
the noise of its rush, of course, grew in pro-
portion, and the steed began to dance.
“Quiet, Peg !” cried the horseman, still
reading.
The steed now bolted, in a paroxysm of
alarm, and the rider began thoughtfully to
fold his letter.
But the man, in his absence of mind, had
forgotten, it seems, what coat he wore. It
possessed not the requisite pocket, and the
letter consequently fell to the ground near
Cuthbert. While the latter stooped to pick

it up, the rider was violently borne to a
distance.
The little incident was over. The unos-
tentatious horseman seemed to be scarcely
conscious of what had fixed everybody's
attention else, and certainly much less atten-
tive to the temporary vagaries in which
Peggy had indulged, than to the fall of his
letter, which young Harding was now bear-
ing towards him.
“Thanks, sir—thanks !” said he, in a
slightly off-hand manner, with which Cuth-
bert was not at all satisfied—“sorry you
should take the trouble.”
“I conclude I have the pleasure of speak-
ing to Mr. Brompton, of the—the-_”
“At your service, sir,” interrupted the
other ; "and of anything from a stable loft
to an auction room, from Newmarket to the
estate of the Limes.”
“I have been anxious to know you, Mr.
Brompton. I have a great respect for men

of genius and courage. You sometimes go
to-to--"
Mr. Brompton did not help Cuthbert to
the word this time. Greatly struck, and
even moved, by the first part of the young
man's last sentence, the like of which he had
not heard addressed to him for the forty
years of his career, he listened with curiosity
to what was to follow. But it was not to
follow. Cuthbert thought better of it.
Nevertheless much was gained.
As to Mr. Brompton, he was a money
making man ; but not what the slang of the
superficial would have us believe, a money-
making machine. There is no such thing.
There is no human being, however enslaved
by one domineering master passion, who has
not his own man's spirit, and man's vanity,
and man's weaknesses, hidden away some-
where ; no, not a human being that has not

hold him habitually governed, in the patent
and social transactions of life, by the great
predominating motives to which he may
have yielded up the serious exertions of his
career. There is something simple in the
cunning, and something soft in the hard,
man, if you could find it out. Circumstances
have generally played their own voluntary,
their own wild airs upon the instrument;
but the silent notes are silent, only because
they are not stricken. Touch them, and they
will surprise you by their unwonted re-
sponse. But you don't know where they
are; you don't know the stops of the instru-
ment; that is the whole secret,
“To where, sir ?” asked Brompton.
Cuthbert looked foolish for once. He had
been thinking of Cumberland, and of Christ's
Hope estate (which was Emily's), merely
because the lady whom he loved had there a
property, and this person was its agent.
While he mendaciously stammered out

"to London," the train had disgorged its
passengers, and Mr. Brompton's eye was
fixed on a man who no sooner saw him, than
he approached.
“Ding them all ?” cried this individual.
“Do you call that a Government ?”
“Then you have failed to get attention to
your invention ?" inquired Mr. Brompton,
freezingly.
“They took three months to answer my
last letter, and then told me, though I have
been three years at them, that I had ad-
dressed myself to the wrong quarter. I'm
tired of it. Why the quarter they said, had
referred me, last year, to the quarter where
I was. They are only playing at blind man's
buff with me. Ah! if I had stuck to my
business, I'd have been a rich man by this
time.”
“Well, go back to it, Hull,” said Bromp-
ton: “it is not too late !”.
“No, I'm not a man, but a marble, if I

do. I have two thousand pounds left ; and
if you'll stick to me, as you said ——”
The man looked up piteously at the hard,
cold face. Cuthbert observed everything
that passed with lively interest.
“As I said !” interrupted Brompton. "I
said, provided you got the Government to
look at it in earnest, I would at once help
you to set up a factory for the supply of the
articles; but now you want to throw your
heft after the hatchet.”
“But I'll force 'em ?” cried Hull. “I'll
shame 'em! I'll get it before the public !
The press will take it up! I'll establish a
special newspaper. It is no secret now.
I've patented all three inventions, and the
more who know of them,” added he, looking
at Cuthbert, and speaking in a loud tone,
and with a certain violence of manner-
“ the more who know of them the merrier.
See what one gets by thinking to serve the
country at large !”

"Your two thousand pounds,” said Mr.
Brompton, “won't go far in the way you
lay down. If it comes to an affair of agitat-
ing, why it is not the right business for it,
man. What large and powerful classes will
ever interest themselves, I should like to
know, in crying out for justice to you, an
obscure inventor, or in insisting that one
individual shall make his fortune !"
“It is not that !” exclaimed Hull. “Won't

“ Hang it!” interrupted Brompton. “You
have lost your wits. An indirect, ultimate
improvement of some sort, in the-Bah! I
have no patience with you. Well, good
morning, I must hurry off. Good morning,
Mr. Harding. Shall be glad to see you at
the Limes, sir, any time. I would have
helped you, Hull, only you——”.
The last word was lost in the clatter of
Peggy's hoofs, and Mr. Brompton galloped
away.

“I dare say,” said young Harding, “that

Do you know anybody ?
“Do I know anybody? What do you
mean by that? Why, I know Jack Bromp-

“He is not anybody,” replied Cuthbert.
“Do you know anybody, I ask you again ?"
“What do you mean by anybody? I
know lots !” retorted Mr. Hull.
“Most probably,” replied Cuthbert, “ but
that is not the reason why your invention
has failed to receive justice I mean, im-
mediate and careful examination. Mr.
Brompton thinks you had better give it up.”
“Give it up!” cried the man, “after
sacrificing a good situation, and half the
savings of many years of hard work ! Mr.
Brompton be shot! I'll spend my last
shilling first."

“Why, I've thrown away three years on

Mr. Hull, furiously.

dangerous look. “And, to commence, I

The other opened his mouth.

ap insult,” pursued Cuthbert,“ and that you
were prepared to regard as an enemy the
first person you have met for three years,
who is willing to serve you in the very
manner you desire ; at least, the first person

“No, I'm blowed if they be! But who

you can open the Ministerial ears to the
voice of public spirit and practical science ?"
“If you can spare ten minutes of your
valuable time,” replied Cuthbert, “come

and you may hear of something to your
advantage,' as the advertisement says.”
“It's the scurvy treatment of that fellow
Brompton that sticks in me, when I come
to reflect on it.”

Cuthbert. “Come along.”
And he proceeded to the inn, followed by
Mr. Hull.

CHAPTER VI.
“ I SAY, sir, I forgot to ask you,” cried Mr.
Hull, when Cuthbert and he had been in-
stalled in a room of the Railway Whistle,
“ but you have not told me your name !"
Cuthbert had seated himself at a table,
and, having selected one from half a dozen
sheets of note paper, which, according to
his orders on entering, the waiter had
brought, was busily occupied in writing.
He looked up for a moment.
“You did not forget, you asked me who
the dickens I was. Change that style when
you ask me again. Meantime, take a chair,”
added he, “and oblige me by not inter-
rupting me till I have hurried off a letter,

which must catch this next post. I am
coming to your business in a moment.”
He resumed his writing.
“Dang the chap!” thought Mr. Hull.
“Perhaps he is “Somebody.'”
Several minutes passed, and Cuthbert still
wrote. He folded his letter.
Mr. Hull hummed.
“Now, sir, if you please,” said he.
“Pray be patient, Mr. Hull,” replied
Cuthbert, “and ring the bell which is near
you.”
“Well, I am sure !” interjected Mr. Hull,
mentally. But he rang the bell. Cuthbert
had taken another sheet of note paper, and
was already engaged rapidly with a second
letter when the waiter entered.
“A light and some sealing wax,” said
Cuthbert, without looking up.
The waiter vanished. When he returned
with the articles required, Cuthbert was
folding his second letter.

“Is that young gentleman whom I noticed
as I came in,” inquired he, “still about the
premises ? He with the fair complexion.
Very handsome. Wore a light frock."
The waiter fixed his eyes on the ceiling
for a moment, and then, with a sudden
start of intelligence and a smile, replied—
“Oh, I know the gentleman you mean,
sir. No, sir ; he's gone, sir. I hear he did
something extraordinary as the goods train
was going by this morning. Saved a child's
life or something, sir !”.
“That is the gentleman,” replied Cuthbert.
“Ah! he is gone!”
Cuthbert bit his lip, and seemed discon-
certed for a moment, during which the
waiter played irresolutely with the handle
of the door, for he felt that he had not
received the order for which he had been
summoned.
But of what was young Harding in want ?

thing in the world, when you consider that
a ravening inventor, who still possessed two
thousand pounds, and who meditated the
heroic expenditure of his last shilling in
furtherance of a darling project, was there
by special invitation, impatiently awaiting
the youthful money-spinner's pleasure. In
presence of a man who had still two
thousand pounds, and who evidently valued
that sum as but dross, in comparison with
the interests of a great invention, such a
character as Master Cuthbert Harding must
have had weighty reasons indeed to make
him desire to confer with anybody else first ;
what he wanted must, therefore, have been
vitally important. No—it was but the
meaning of a certain word. He looked at
his watch. And that explains the other-
wise unaccountable disregard and postpone-
ment of which Mr. Robert Hull now began
to feel himself, with some indignation, to
be the victim. Cuthbert could keep back

Mr. Hull safely enough, but he could not
keep back the hour of post. Mr. Hull and
the patent could be induced to wait for
him, but tide and time tarry for no man.
In a few minutes he would be very little
disposed to delay further his conversation
with that individual, for then it would be
too late to attend to what was now en-
grossing his solicitude : and once it became
really too late to attempt anything, a fig
for it in Master Cuthbert's estimation. At
that age, he lost no time in brooding over
that irrevocable past which no brooding
can recall. Let the past bury its own dead,
was his maxim.
“Dang it !” cried Mr. Hull, “I do want
to come to the point, that is the truth! Do
you suppose I'm going tom ”
Cuthbert arrested the sentence by a
glance. Nay, Mr. Hull not only stopped
in the middle of what he was saying, but
had the air of one who suddenly becomes

some
sensible that he has been guilty of some
offence.
“You have squandered three years,” said
Cuthbert, hissing out the words, “and you
begrudge three minutes ! And those blun-
dering years have nearly destroyed you,
while these wisely spent minutes would have
made a man of you again.”
He paused for a moment and then added-
“I entreat a little patience.”
Mr. Hull gathered himself into a screwed
attitude, shut his mouth, and nodded his
head with violence.
Cuthbert relapsed into as complete a tem-
porary oblivion of him, as if he was not in
existence. Cuthbert was looking at the
waiter, and musing. Should he hazard his
present design ? Well, it could not do any
harm, even were his conjecture wrong; and,
while a miss would be nowise either dis-
creditable or disastrous, the hit, on the other
hand, if a hit it proved, would, beyond
doubt, be very considerable.

“Confound it !” thought he, “there is
something positively and painfully ridiculous
in such ignorance. Eton, indeed! As if
we had not to deal in business with modern
men of many nations. Some very ordinary,
well known word, I have no doubt, this

astray, it is true, by acting on my guess.
Still it is only a guess, and this word might
be important; in any case, it would be a
satisfaction to be sure of what really was
meant !”
While he was thus, in that sunny noontide
and the quiet little room of that railway inn,
“stopped by the elements,” like Napoleon in
Russia (to borrow from the riot of a brilliant
man's expressions)—while thus cabined and
confined by such a puerile difficulty, an ex-
ceedingly commonplace incident roused him
out of his reflections, or, rather, guided them
towards an immediate means of solution.

door came jerkily, and not seductively, to
his ear. A terrific and spasmodic bit of
execution that!
“Ah !” thought Cuthbert, “this castle
encloseth some fair maiden, who smiteth the
resounding instrument. That is practice !"
A man has not a sister for nothing.
“Who is it,” said he to the waiter, “play-
ing the piano so—ahem !—so nicely ?”
The waiter grinned, and Mr. Hull started
with indignant amazement. Notwithstand-
ing that start, Mr. Hull, however, spoke not
a word. He had been, for some time,
studying Cuthbert's appearance, and com-
paring it with the cavalier manner of such
a question as “Do you know anybody ?”
and of such a threat as “I will abandon you
to your own devices, if you interrupt me
again.”
He was somewhat impressed by the result
of this examination—nay, he was even a
little under the stroke of awe, or of that

ascendant which the extraordinary lad con-
trived to exercise at times. And now, al-
though scandalized by finding that the young
gentleman was thinking of a piano, instead
of attending to the important invention,
which was the one thing needful; yet such
was the stock of vague respect and expect-
ancy which he had lain in during his scrutiny
of Cuthbert, that those feelings predominated
even over the disedifying shock of the last
inquiry addressed to the waiter. See what
an opinion entertained of you, even when
merely conjectural, is !
“That's our master's young missus, sir,"
replied the waiter, with the sly grin which has
been chronicled. And, truth to say, the
music was detestable. The last waiter had
given warning in consequence. Fortunately,
Nature had drawn a rather hard and fibrous
cuticle over the tympanum of the present
functionary's ear.

had been the first question of the landlord in
hiring him.
“No, sir-tough,” was the reply.
“Oh!” said Cuthbert, half to the waiter
and half to himself ; “accomplishments—
French, drawing, use of the globes, and a
dexterous display of the ankle-taught at
some tiptop boarding school.”
“I have no doubt, if you take my com-
pliments — the compliments of a young
gentleman who has just received a letter, in
French, from his sister, which he must in-
fallibly answer by this post, that your young
mistress with oblige me with a moment's
loan of a French dictionary.”
Mr. Hull again started, and his look
(although still remaining discreetly untrans-
lated into words) seemed to say—“Here is
a go !”
The waiter disappeared in quite a glitter
and halo of grins.

This was a fib; Cuthbert felt it was ; the
music had ceased ; and Cuthbert saw the
French dictionary, at that very moment,
being transferred from the bookshelf to a
chair, where the young lady proceeded to sit
on the forty and odd thousand words of the
French language-he saw this, I say, as
plainly as if he had been in the room.
“There !” cried he, writing hastily a word
on a sheet of note paper, and handing it to
the waiter ; “take her that-compliments as
before—and what does it mean?”
The waiter was longer absent than the
first time. Cuthbert even heard him come
out, and close the door, but not descend. A
few moments, and the bell rang. Waiter
knocks. Door opens.
“Miss Ferdinanda's compliments, sir,”
said the waiter, shortly afterwards, handing

froglike, note, only flatter than the animal.
“Hum !” said Cuthbert. “Cassette, the
box which young ladies '-bah ! ‘Cassette, a
casket.' Cassette, used for that case of
jewels. You may go.”
The domestic left the room, and Cuthbert
rewrote one of his letters, put it in a small
envelope, directed it, enclosed it in the other
letter, and directed this last to Falconer.
Another, not so long in the composition, he
addressed to Mr. Melcombe.
“Now, Mr. Hull, for you,” said young
Harding, who, however, again rang the bell.
When the waiter returned, Cuthbert asked,
was there anybody who could at once take a
letter to the post-office ?
But, as the servant seemed to hesitate,
Cuthbert immediately rose, put on his hat,
and said, while handing the waiter a small
piece of money,
“ Come. Mr. Hull ! We can arrange that

“Yes, sir ; who shall I say, sir ?”
“Say the young gentleman."
And Cuthbert hastily quitted the inn, Mr.

“Well! I never !” thought this last.
“He treats me as if the whole county be-
longed to him.”
“Mr. Hull,” said Cuthbert, when they
were outside, “my object in postponing, for
five minutes, your affair, was merely and
solely to be able to give it an undivided
mind. It deserves no less,” added Cuthbert,
as he dropped the larger of his two envelopes

hour later, to Falconer's surprise (for it had
seemed to fly like half a minute), he heard a
metallic clang, and then that indescribable
screech which no stranger, the first time he
hears it, ever comprehends, and which your
loving Londoner recognizes as an announce-
ment of the first milk of that day. Not
altogether cow's milk, but yet London's milk.
A great deal of virtue, without belonging to
the thing itself, is associated with its distri-
bution. Among the birds, also, there exists
an urban, as well as a rural, population; a
town-haunting class, the fashionable tribes of

the feathered world. What they can gain
by such affectation, and, above all, by such
airs, I know not. They are a misguided race.
Another and much vaster stretch of time
was now traversed unconsciously by the
occupied mind of Falconer, when he suddenly
cried—
“Bless me! Already ! Ah! the day is too
short for one's business ; that is, for one's
work. Alas! there is a difference ?".
He had begun his day pretty early, too.
What provoked his exclamation was the first
rap of the postman in the neighbourhood.
The knock now ran raining along the adja-
cent street like a patter of musketry, and
rattled up and down, in and out of chambers,
where these last happened to be furnished
with knockers.
Falconer's had that appendage. Two in-
tervening doors, both of them shut, ren-
dered faint the plodding tread of the letter
carrier, and quite inaudible the rustle (other-

wise unmistakable) of some document as it
slid through the orifice intended for it, and
fell into the receiving box in Falconer's outer
room. Immediately afterwards, the rap tap
sent its peremptory "advice of the fact” to
the young barrister's ear, and the dull tramp
receded.
“Ah! from Harding !” said he, as he
opened the letter. “That is all right. He
sends me the shares, no doubt. Yes, here
they are. Quite correct. Hollo! what is
this ? 'Immediate. To His Imper——""
And he gazed in surprise at a sealed
enclosure. Resuming the perusal of the
letter addressed to himself, he soon found
what he had to do, although his surprise
was not thereby diminished ; if anything, it
was increased.
“Curious !” muttered he. “But, at least,
nothing can be more clearly enjoined. And
I'll render this little service to Harding,
since service it seems to be, in my own

person. He is a very nice, good, simple-
hearted fellow, is Harding. We were always,
great friends."
And Cuthbert, some hundred miles or so
distant, saw Falconer proceed to write a
letter; and then he saw Falconer go to a
drawer, and unlock it with a bramah key, and
select from the sum of five hundred and
twenty-five pounds, the sum of two hundred
pounds ; only Cuthbert could not see in
how many notes. But that did not matter ;
there might be ten twenty pound notes, or
twenty ten pound, or any other combina-
tion. The sum was correct, and the notes
were duly enclosed in the letter which Fal-
coner had just written. Of that, Cuthbert
felt quite sure, as from Throstledale, in one
second's imagination, he watched his friend's
painstaking, simple face, bending over the
large table in the prim wood-panelled inner
room of the dingy old chambers in Lincoln's

With Cuthbert, at Throstledale, time stood
still during all these changes ; but it ran
fast at Lincoln's Inn. It was still the same
single second of time with the imagining
spectator, when Falconer, now hastening
with his breakfast, started, for the second
time that morning, at a cry. This second
screech of a London morning was the first
that Cuthbert had heard in his mind, ex-
perience being necessary to know what the
milk song was like.
But he had anticipated Falconer's news-
paper, duly brought to chambers, but not
until about breakfast hour; so as not to
beguile the recluse into too much intellectual
dissipation, but, on the contrary, so as to
kill two birds with one stone, and allow mind
and body to take their recreation together.
"Bless me!" Falconer once more ex-
claimed. “I must get this, to come here
again at lunch, when I have returned from
St. James's. I shall be late otherwise, sure

as a gun ” (a favourite simile of that fertile-
minded barrister, in whose hands a gun was
not sure)—“ as sure as a gun, I shall be
late otherwise with Harding's commission.
Ha! breach of promise—great speech of
-- in that case of Susan's—poor Susan !
No, it is too severe a temptation. I must
not look at it, or I shall never tear myself
away in time.”
And Falconer pushed the paper from him.
He sighed, however, and muttered
“Harding does not know, Harding little
guesses, what I sacrifice this morning, in
order to see his commission punctually exe-
cuted !”
Mr. Falconer, we beg your pardon, Master
Harding guessed it all, knew it all, saw you.
" That dear, good, simple Falconer,"
thought Cuthbert, “ I can see him.”
And it was true; Cuthbert did see him.
They called each other simple, too. Ah!
what a difference !

It now began to be quite another thing
in London. Again, the practised denizen,
quite irrespectively of all watches and all
clocks, could have told you the hour; yes,
blindfold.
As to Falconer, he had taken so kindly
to that vast beloved home of his, he cherished
that "stony hearted” stepmother so dearly,
he was so completely saturated with all the
instincts and intuitions of a thorough Lon-
doner, that he always knew the phases of
the half hours. He now smelt, and almost
saw, ten o'clock, as well as heard it; and
if each, and all, of those three senses had
been suddenly deprived of their indications,
he would yet have felt the hour, while
hurrying through Covent Garden and Leices-
ter Square towards the Haymarket.
Cuthbert, it must be admitted, felt none
of these sensations, smelt none of these
odours, saw none of these myriad details,
fused, as they pass, into one vague, but un-

erring instinct. Yet Cuthbert did, at least,
see Falconer rush to the door of a large
house, somewhere about the corners of King
Street, and give a vehement knock, like a
postman's, and drop a letter into the box,
and retreat swiftly. At ten yards' distance
he became invisible. The fog had swallowed
up his figure.
Two persons had just finished breakfast
in a large room. A casket lay on the table
between them. He with the bald Italian
brow, and acute, small features (in which
there was a certain sweetness of expression),
had his hand upon the casket. The other,
with the quiet, the almost phlegmatic, man-
ner, the massive chin, the grand classic
facial outline, and the sculpturesque head,
was leaning back in his chair, his eyes half
closed in thought.
A servant entered with a letter on a silver
plate, said nothing, slid the letter upon the
table (since he to whom it was directed
stirred not), and so withdrew.

When the letter had been perused, the
superior of the two who were thus sitting
together said, in French-
“I can avail myself of this. You may
put the case away for another time-per-
haps for ever. It was well to delay such an
expedient to the last moment. By that
means we are sure that it is Fate which
acts; otherwise, it had been I myself. And
thus there might have been regret after-
wards.”
So saying, he extended the letter towards
his companion.
The latter began to read parts of the letter
aloud. His pronunciation of the English,
which he perfectly comprehended, was better
than that of his superior, who equally under-
stood it, but still was far from excellent.
“Your Imperial Highness need not
scruple to use this ; for such advances are

ward part of my professed business or

(and this I would waive at your command)
is the wish I have expressed, that you
would gratify me by not requiring any
receipt to pass between us in the matter.
I will note the sum down on my side, as
lent; your I. H. on yours, as borrowed ;
enjoining on your representatives or assigns
to liquidate it when they can, in case of
your death. In the present case, I charge
not my accustomed interest; let it run at
six per cent. As to my means of guessing
that the sum may be desirable (for I do
not know this), I have only to repeat that
my calling is partly that of a money lender,
and we naturally make a point of learning
what others can never even suspect, and
what remains, for the sake of our own
advantage, a secret with ourselves.

shall be agreeable to the person who, in
this instance, will, I trust, do me the

honour of using the money. I only regret
that it is not fifty times the amount; but,
unluckily, I have just locked up all my
loose capital for the moment, viz., a sum
of eleven thousand pounds, which happened
to be recouped by me rather sooner than
I expected, and which I (not foreseeing
the present case) too hastily remerged on
a mortgage at twelve per cent. Your

servant,

At the words, “twelve per cent.” the
reader paused. He then folded the letter,
replacing in it the bank notes for two
hundred pounds, and handed the whole
back to bis superior.
This gentleman once more separated
the letter from its enclosures, gave these
last to his companion, and, putting Cuth-
bert's composition in his pocket, said

“You will pay Mr. Bradworth before
twelve o'clock.” After a long pause he
added : “My uncle made a mistake about
destiny.”
“Surely, you also believe in it?”
“I believe in it after quite another
fashion. I, too, confide in my star; or,
to employ a far better phrase, I confide
in my mission; and it will be accom-
plished.”
“Then, like him, you have your star ?"
“No; my star has me. I have my
mission, but I am only its instrument, not
its master. I like the term 'mission'
better; for I have a work to do, and I
will do it. My uncle fell by that very
mistake. He went to Russia, for example,
because he thought his star was at his
beck and would obey him.”
“ It cheated him once," said the inferior.
“No; he cheated it. He should have
obeyed, just where he thought he would

receive obedience. I will imitate him
where his mighty intelligence, his colossal
genius, inspired him with the true principles
of action. I will resume, continue, and
complete, his broken work, without slavishly
copying all his means.”
“That thought of his high destiny in-
spired him," said the other.
“The thought of it also inspires me.”
“But——” said the other, interrogatively,
when the exile had here paused.
“But,” continued the first, “my pride
is the pride of serving my mission, as his
was at first."
“That is a kind of humility,” said the
other.
"Be it so. But you mistake one thing
completely. It is not the success of my
uncle which makes my principal strength
at the outset.”
“What then?” inquired the thin-faced
comrade.

“ His success is a great thing, but there
is something still greater."
“And that ?" again demanded the other.
“Is his fall !” pursued the superior spirit.
“His fall !” exclaimed the physician.
“Yes, indubitably,” resumed the exile.
“What he overthrew and what he built
up in France, was overthrown and built up
by the will of the French nation ; and that
is a great source of strength, even when
spontaneous, calm, unprovoked, even when
not raging with the wounds of insulted pride.
But what was afterwards re-established in
France, was re-established, not only in con-
tempt of this national will, but by the
force of foreign will. The nature of the
success obtained by the used-up dynasties
was itself fatal to them. Such a success
was incurably fatal. From the moment
when those dynasties came back, by the
virtue and grace of three million foreign
bayonets, from that moment they were

doomed. It became, thenceforward, a mere
question of time. All that was required
was, for the country to realize that one
simple fact; for that fact to spread itself,
infuse itself, take solution, as a chemist
would say, in the public mind, and saturate
the people thoroughly. In saying, ‘now
it has operated,'' now, it is fully realized,'
or 'now' or ‘now,' we might be mistaken ;
but about the eventual effect, mistaken no
thinking man could be. The nation had
raised Napoleon; that is a vital point ;
but it is more vital still, that foreigners
raised his successors. His splendid reign is
in my favour ; his fall is more so. Only
for his fall, I should have had on my side
merely the national will, calmly pro-
claiming itself. By means of his fall, I
have that national will vehemently vindi-
cating itself from foreign dictation. This
must infallibly, sooner or later, carry me
to power; but what will keep me there
must be something else.”

“And that—what is it?" said the
physician.
“My own conduct; my own deeds; the
gratitude of a nation restored to its proper
rank; the respect of a world. Such is my
mission: the thought of it inspires me

His companion suggested, in
a low tone:
“With pride."
“No. I think, as you just now said, that
it is rather with humility,” pursued the
other ; “with humility, with patience, and
with courage.”
A silence ensued, which was broken by
the inferior.
“Shall I write this lender's name in the
list of those who have served you in the
days of our adversity ?"
“It is impossible. He has signed no
name. *C. H.' only. But write those
initials, at least.”

“What shall I mark of him?"
The Prince hesitated. After a few
minutes, he said
“I do not believe what he says about that
sum of eleven thousand pounds, locked up
inopportunely.”
“How not believe ?” asked the physician.
“Whether that he would not lend it ? or
that he does not possess it ?”
“I hardly know, but there is something
false about the letter.”
“Still, the service is real and true,” re-
marked the attendant.
“Yes, and I will serve him in return, so
far as that may safely be.”
“Perhaps,” said the subordinate, “he is
some enthusiastic adherent, not wishing to
sign his name, merely because he is
English.”
“No,” replied the other. “Enthusiasm
trusts, and does more than trust. He would
have given his name in full; or, were there

really some imperious motive of a noble kind
for withholding it, he would not have given
even his initials. Those initials mean a
claim on my gratitude hereafter.”
“But the abatement of the interest, at
least,” urged the subordinate, “looks very
generous.”
“Not to me,” replied the exile. “But I
will tell you what it does look, and what it
is ; it looks, and is, the mark by which a lie
is detected on the very face of this letter.
If the abatement of the interest was adopted
without any selfish view, he who adopted it
would not have pointed to it. Unselfishness
does not say, 'look at me. Here is a corres-
pondent (giving initials to which he will some
day refer), and saying, see how little I think
of myself. His wish that I should notice his
generosity shows that he has an object in
being generous. Real generosity would
efface itself. But he is an able, far seeing,
and adroit man; and, if he be upright as

well, he is worth serving. Moreover, I am
obliged to him.”
“That sums it up," said the physician,
who hastily made a note in a pretty large,
but rather thin and flat, book with clasps,
which he took from the breast pocket of his
frock coat, and returned thither when the
ink was dry.
Cuthbert, all this time, had lived but a
moment; it was only while his large envelope
was dropping into the receiving box of the
Throstledale post-office that he endeavoured
'to trace, in imagination, the fate of the
respective documents which it contained.
The reader is now minutely apprised of
that fate as it really was. The flash of
Cuthbert's conjecture was tolerably true, so
far as his friend Falconer is concerned. Of
the other person to whom he had written, he
said to himself-
“How he will be puzzled !” (The reader
sces whether this was the case.) “Well, it

is no harm to make friends who may yet
prove powerful. I am kind to the fairy in
the ugly withered guise of the false hag as
which she has to spend her days of trouble;
when she becomes the radiant queen again,
she will, perhaps, do me some good turn, in
repayment. I will let the gentleman know
who his friend C. H.' is, one day. Mean-
time, it is but two hundred; and, even if
he never comes to anything, he can intro-
duce me to some wealthy spendthrift, who
will be glad to take refuge in the arms of
my twelve, or fifteen, or twenty, per cent. as
I may see best, out of the grip of eighty for
the hundred. He'll think me some capitalist !
—what fun! So generous, too!”
“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Hull, “is this a
lark with me, or is it not? Are you ready
to do what you said ?”.
Cuthbert started from his reverie.
"It is done already,” said he. “You see

Railway Whistle.
“I see it,” replied Mr. Hull,

CHAPTER VIII.
WITH the conversation between Cuthbert
and this honest inventor (the conclusion of
which we will mention in a moment), Cuth-
bert's youth, as such, may be said to have
terminated. At all events, a sufficient idea
of it will have been given. Which being
so, in order to observe the limits I have
prescribed to myself, we shall presently have
to mount, as it were, on a very fleet-footed
narrative, and (almost at Cuthbert's own
pace, on a remarkable occasion) to hurry
along the path of his destiny. On the one
hand, as the enormous resources which
Cuthbert soon commanded, or seemed to

command, were not altogether blown into
his hands like a windfall from a tree on a
gusty day, it is right to show something
of this fact ; for it is really a fact connected
with the very nature of the man. On the
other hand, it is not with the hundred
methods of money-spinning in general, nor
even with those adopted by one noted
money-spinner, as methods, but with the
man himself, his designs, his passions, and
whither they brought him, that we are here
concerned ; for this is a narrative, in which
there figures, indeed, a person noted and
eminent in a certain kind of business or
craft; but it is not an exposition or ex-
planation of that craft.
Whoever has watched a carrier pigeon
launched upon an errand, can remember how
reluctant he felt to remove his eyes while
the aerial messenger traced in the heavens
that spiral staircase with which he always
begins the exercise of his confidential free-

dom. Once these gyrations over, there
would be comparatively little attraction in
pursuing the straight flight.
The nature of the difficulties which beset
Cuthbert Harding's first great passion gave
all his passions a new direction; the lean
kine of his mind devoured the fat. That
first passion itself was swallowed up by one
much fiercer; and something else was like-
wise gradually swallowed up-I mean his
respect for himself, a feeling quite different
from pride, and, in truth, the opposite of
pride, a feeling like that of a conscientious
trustee; for a man does not make himself,
but his money a man may be said to make ;
and let him beware of the hour when he
begins to worship the work of his own
hands.
Only for this, it would be hardly worth
while to show how the interview terminated
between him and Mr. Hull. But it is soon
dispatched.

as
It was with a boastful and, under the
circumstances, a cunningly managed allusion,
that Cuthbert had referred to the meaning
of “gentleman” as a word, and to the
character of “gentleman ” as a thing.
But, certainly, the abrupt inquiry in which
he, all at once, landed the conversation, was
not a gentleman's. In short, the interro-
gatory with which the last chapter ended
was, in common parlance, anything but
delicate. Dr. Marlowe Harding would have
involuntarily honoured and respected, ad-
mired, and venerated it as something
“deucedly” and eminently indelicate. Yet,
though a laudably indelicate interrogatory,
it was, at the same time, in another sense,
a delicate question.
“Whew!” whistled Mr. Hull, pretty
much in the tone in which Mr. Melcombe
himself had uttered, on a former occasion,
that expressive sibilation, so indicative of
a new light bursting on the mind.

“Well,” demanded Cuthbert, very calmly,
although he coloured a little ; "what am I
to understand by 'whew ?!”.
“Is that the way the land lies?” said
Mr. Hull, grinning.
“That is the way,” said Cuthbert, seri-
ously. “The straightest way is the shortest
way, in business.”
“Give you !” resumed Mr. Hull, thought-
fully ; " and to think you had almost made
me afraid of you! I stood in awe, as 'twere.
Give you !” and he stared, grinning from
ear to ear.
Cuthbert met this hilarity with compo-
sure and seriousness, returning the inventor's
look of mingled astonishment and mirth
with one of those under regards of his which
were so brooding.
“Why !” cried the delighted and diverted
Mr. Hull, “ only think ! I took you for
quite another guess person. I thought you

And he stopped with his mouth open.
Cuthbert had gradually raised his head ;
and now this busy, industrious, simple crea-
ture, this good linnet of the hedge, was
under the full gaze of that rare serpent of
the savannah.
“You thought I was a what ?—for we
are losing time.”
Mr. Hull replied not.
“Well, you need not finish the sentence,"
resumed Cuthbert ; “I know the word you
would have added. It was 'gentleman.'
The murder is out—eh ?”
“No offence,” interposed Mr. Hull, hastily.
“I did not mean that I regretted you wasn't.
It is better as it is,” continued he, with
cheerful kindness. “All these things are
for the best, and come rightest the way
they do come. I'm sure, if I didn't think
so,” he added gravely, “I should have had
my heart broke long ago.”
Cuthbert bit his lip. The other noticed

his annoyance, and misinterpreted the cause
of it ludicrously.
“ Cheer up, my hearty !” said he. “If
you can do my job for me, I shan't give
you worse terms because you don't happen
to be exactly what I took you for. Indeed,
I'd rather you wasn't.”
Cuthbert still mused gloomily. Truth to
tell, his reflections at that moment were not
those of the self-applauding schemer, but
were weak—is that the word ?—and even,
for a second, faltering and romantic.
“What would Emily think ?—what would
she think of this ?-of Cuthbert? Dare I
let even little Henrietta Mandeville know
me as I am beginning to be ? Dare I let
my own father know ?-or Geoffrey ?-or
even little Winny ?”
Such was the fleeting idea which vexed
his serenity.
“Come, don't stand staring at the ground,
as if you would bore two holes with your

eyes right through to the antipodes !” cried
Mr. Hull. “What if you do look, or did
look, like one of those who would have
supported a scientific improvement for im-
provement's sake, or from a motive of
interest in the service and general good of
the country? I suppose you must get your
bread, like other folks. It is not any dis-
grace, after all, to be mistaken, at the first
blush, for—for—something better than what
you— ”
“You spoke of three inventions, or im-
provements,” interrupted Cuthbert, without
adverting to these consolations. “Do you

“I want them to be examined,” inter-
rupted Hull, in his turn, “and pronounced
upon by competent men, at once, and no
more palavering, no more shuffling, about

possible in their behaviour to me hitherto;
as improper-just one as another.”
“What is the nature of each invention ?”
inquired Cuthbert.
“ The first is a letter sorter, for large
post-offices. The second is not likely to do
any good except in India, and it is a military
thing. When I say India, I mean any hot
country where water is just more scarce in
proportion as it is more wanted. The third
is an improvement in guns."
“And all you want is, to have these sug-
gestions fairly and seriously examined by
Government, through means of practical
judges ?” asked Cuthbert.
“No,” said Hull; “ that is not quite all,
One of the inventions requires an expensive
experiment. I want the Government to pay
the expense of that experiment, in case, and
only in case, it prove successful.”
Cuthbert wondered within himself why
the man had not long since addressed him-

self to some public spirited member of the
House of Commons, and thus sought to com-
pel attention to his ideas. But Mr. Hull
had done this, and he was the seventieth
person whom that member had listened to,
urging what appeared to be equally plausible
inventions, during a parliamentary career of
about nine years. The member's original
enthusiasm was frozen up. He had under-
taken several such briefs. Unfortunately,
one or two of them had got him laughed at,
and not one of them had operated any revo-
lution either in science or in its applications.
Such suggestions, he had been told, were
literally carted ; they were piled in several
vans, drawn by two horses, every week day ;
while the mere paper containing the explana-
tion of them weighed heavier, at the end of
the year, than the largest of the Egyptian
pyramids. Competent persons, he was as-

similar pretensions. His particular client's
would have their due turn. To give them
priority would be to refuse that priority to
what was actually under scrutiny now. Be
fore this examination, was he sure they were
not the usual rubbish? Was he sure they
were an exceptional treasure ?
Stuff and nonsense ! (only he said this in
parliamentary style.) He would not be put
off by the slang of office, the traditional
platitudes of routine. He would have jus-
tice, the whole justice, and nothing but
justice-full, immediate, instantaneous jus-
tice. Well, he so stormed, that, to pacify or
quiet him, ministers gave him plenty of
hope, and ordered the most solemn inquiry
to be forthwith instituted into the wonderful
discoveries of which he was but the humble,
albeit zealous, exponent. The world stood
still until one bright, particular Douster-
swivel had his theories put to the test; for
self deluding “inventors” are to real inven-
inyen-

tors as ninety-nine to one. All the other
inventors of that special epoch were denied
every semblance of a hearing. They were
extremely indignant; yet the grand eureka,
meanwhile, fulfilled not the noble expecta-
tions of the disinterested upholder of unap-
preciated genius and of science aggrieved.
It was not, however, Cuthbert's business
to say that he fancied others could help Mr.
Hull. He preferred, at present, to help Mr.
Hull himself. And Mr. Hull having offered
to give him a share in the patent in answer
to his indelicate inquiry, young Harding
peremptorily declined that advantage, and
intimated a weakness for some round sum of
money instead. This was agreed to, and, in
the course of about a week, Mr. Hull having
got a formal and official pledge for the
inquiry which his unaided exertions had
wasted three years in vainly seeking, the
money was faithfully paid to Master Cuth-
bert. How the inquiry itself terminated,

Cuthbert never cared to inform himself.
His business in the business ended just
where the business of poor Mr. Hull began.
Cuthbert, in spite of his first refusal, did
dine with Dr. Harding that evening.

CHAPTER IX.
MR. WILLIAM HARDING “sported” a letter
bag, and early one morning, as the postboy
came whistling along the green lane between
the plantations, he was met by the younger
Mr. Harding. Touching his cap, the lad
was passing on, when. Cuthbert said,
“Nothing for me, I suppose ?"
“Nothing for you, sir," replied the lad,
who was called Dick.
“Any cross post letters ? There ought to
be a letter addressed to my father from-
from the county."
“There ain't no county letter, sir.”
“ Indeed! You seem sharp. Did you

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
131
notice the letters, then, when the postmaster
put them into the bag ?”
“No, sir; not to say when he put them
into the bag to-day; for he didn't do it.”
“How do you know there is not a county
letter ?”
“ Because there ain't no letter at all, not
to-day, sir.”
Cuthbert took the bag, of which his father
always took the key, shook it, and felt it.
Evidently it was empty. His clasp knife
was not put in requisition.
He told the boy to carry the bag to the
cottage, and then to ask Mrs. Harding to
put up a cold dinner in a basket; which
done, he was to bring the basket and a
couple of fishing rods; he would find him
(Master Cuthbert) on the other road, going
towards the trout stream.
Dick was much pleased with his com-
mission, and he soon rejoined Cuthbert, who
selected a point of the stream from which

132
HARDING
the road could be watched for a consider-
able distance.
About two hours might have thus passed,
when Cuthbert rose. Dick started to his
feet.
“Wait here,” said Cuthbert, “till I call
to you from the road. I may then, probably,
give you something to take to the cottage,
but whatever I give you, or whatever I
tell you, you have merely to run away till
you come to the swing gate of the planta-
tion, and to wait for me there. There,
mind. On no account, move an inch
further; and, above all, don't go to the
cottage, don't go home, till I come to you
again at the swing gate."
So saying, he left the boy, who wondered
for a moment, but presently comforted him-
self by peeping into the basket, and then
by whipping the stream with his rod in
a manner which would have made Izaak
Walton faint.

Meanwhile, a real horse was approaching
at a smart trot along the road. On seeing
Cuthbert, who had sprung into the high-
way, the rider pulled up, and the horse
shied. A country groom, however, is not
easily thrown. The man seemed to know
Cuthbert, and, touching his hat, hesitated
a moment, but was then passing onward
with that slow pace which respect enjoins,
when a ray of intelligence appeared sud-
denly to enlighten young Harding's visage.
He stopped, and the rider did the same,
saluting again.
“I think I remember your face,” said
Cuthbert, “even if I did not know your
livery. Sir Walter and the rest are well,
I hope, at the Park ?”
“Quite well, sir, I thank you," said the
groom.
“Going to the railway, I suppose ?” said
Cuthbert.
“No, sir; I am going to Mr. Harding's,


## p. 134 (#142) ############################################

134
HARDING
your father's, sir, at Lea Meadows, with Sir
Walter's compliments and a note.”
“Oh, true ?” replied Cuthbert ; “my
father told me he expected to hear from
Sir Walter. You can give me the note ;
I'l deliver it to my father. How is Mr.
Geoffrey ?”
The man took out the letter, but looked
with shyness at it as he beld it doubtfully.
“Mr. Geoffrey, sir ? He's not at the
Park, sir. I hope you will pardon it, sir,
but Sir Walter said, sir, that I was to give
this to Mr. Harding, senior.”
“He's at Oxford, I know,” interrupted
Cuthbert. “Left the Duke of Man's yester-
day. Ahl a note for my father ; he is at
home. A hot day for your ride-here's a
crown for thirst. Thirst should be crowned
-ha, ha! You had better get down, and
I'll mount while you run round to the
cottage with the letter. You'll find me
hereabouts on your return."


## p. 135 (#143) ############################################

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
135
As the groom, still holding the note,
dismounted, Cuthbert extended the money
towards him. The man took it with an
obeisance and grin of gratitude, and Cuth-
bert added--
“Now, you just run on with that letter
to the cottage ; you say it is addressed ——”
And in a careless manner, in order merely
to glance at the address, he took the note,
for a moment, out of the groom's hand.
For a moment ! How was that groom
to get that letter again?
“Egad !” said Cuthbert; “this is a very
nice horse ; I doubt if I ought to venture
on him ; I have hurt my shoulder. Perhaps
you might take him to the cottage after all.”
“Take this letter,” said Cuthbert,“ to
my father. Any answer ?” added he, turn-
ing to the groom.
“I was not told to wait for an answer,
sir," replied that functionary ; “ leastways,
I was told not to wait for one.”


## p. 136 (#144) ############################################

HARDING
“Well,” said Cuthbert to Dick, “away
with you, then, and remember what you
have to do.”
And the lad ran off with the letter.
“My father is at home,” again remarked
Cuthbert, who continued his stroll for awhile
along the road which was the servant's way
back ; by-and-by he made the man mount
and trot whence he came, by telling him
that now he could do so, and that he himself
would return and ask his father what news
from Sir Walter.
The part which Dick played in this little
transaction may seem a device of over
caution ; but it was not entirely superfluous.
The proof is, that Sir Walter said to the
groom that evening-
“You have been to Lea Meadows, and
have delivered the letter? Whom did you
see?”
“I saw their regular postboy, Sir Walter”
(the remembrance of the crown which his

thirst had received made the man, as Cuth-
bert knew it would, a little shy), “and I
saw young Mr. Harding.”
“Did you give the letter to young Mr.
Harding ?”
“No, Sir Walter; the postboy ran in
with it to the cottage, while young Mr.
Harding walked a bit this way, and asked
me how they all was at the Park.”
“Oh! walked this way? But old Mr.
Harding—_"
“Was at home, Sir Walter, in the cottage;
and the postboy, who happened to be there,
took in the letter.”
“Quite right. And how is young Mr.
Harding ?”
“He was all well, Sir Walter, except his
shoulder, he said. He said, when he had
come about half a mile, that he must go
back, and ask his father what news from Sir
Walter ? says he.”
Sir Walter received a due acknowledgment

of the letter from Mr. William Harding.
Mr. William Harding knew nothing at all
about the letter.
Little Henrietta, at breakfast, catching
the words, “From Mr. Harding, of Lea
Meadows,” which her father muttered, as he
broke the seal (she had had her own break-
fast), started. But seeing her father absorbed
in the perusal of the letter, she sidled up to
her mother, who was watching anxiously the
hectic of her beautiful little cheeks, and said
in a whisper-
“Wait till papa has done.”
Her mother smiled caressingly upon the
childish mystery, not long, she knew, to be
such, wbatever it was; and in a moment
Sir Walter had folded up the letter absently.
“Papa," said Henrietta, then, “is that
Mr. Cuthbert ?”
“Is what Mr. Cuthbert ?”
“That letter.”
“No," said he, “this letter is not Mr.

Cuthbert; but it is from Mr. Cuthbert's
father. Why do you ask ?"
“I don't know, papa; but I have had
such a strange dream. I think, perhaps, it
was from Rosalie, telling me something
when she was dressing my hair last night.
She said that Mr. Cuthbert, who saved
mamma's life, nearly lost his own about two
nights ago."
“Is he a very high favourite of yours ?
I thought Algy was the chief favourite,” said
the father, smiling.
“Oh! yes, Algy is am. But there
was something so sad and earnest in Mr.
Cuthbert when he looked. And Algy has
never been nearly killed. And Algy will
be a great person, will he not ? Everybody
must like Algy. But Mr. Cuthbert "
“What was the dream ?” asked the
mother.
“I thought I was in the garden, and I
was plucking some flowers, and I told Mr.

Cuthbert to gather some too. And he was
going to do so, when I saw a hand put on
his left shoulder ; I could not see anything
but the hand, and it was a very dark hand.
I wondered where the arm was. And he
stood up all at once, and turned half round
on that side as if he was listening, and then
spoke as if vexed--but not to me.”
“To whom ?” asked the mother.
"I don't know : the person who had the
hand, I suppose, or in answer to something
the person said. It was so stupid in me
not to ask him. I wish I could dream. it
again, and I would ask him at once what it
was he was listening to. And then he would
not stay to gather the bouquet, for he said
that he must be busy in life; and he went
off—and that's all. But, oh mamma! he
said those words “ busy in life,' so sadly; oh,
so sadly! I cannot get them out of my head.
They keep ring, ring, ringing."
“Why, my love,” said Lady Mandeville,

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
141
"you heard those words, not in a dream,
but in reality ; for, the day he was here, you
told me Mr. Cuthbert Harding had used that
very expression. You forget, dearest."
“Did I? Did he? Well, I dreamt it
again last night. What does he mean by
being busy in life, in that sad way? I wish
he would not be busy in life. I wonder how
is he busy in life ?”
“We shall know some day soon, no
doubt,” said Lady Mandeville.
"Perhaps we shall, mamma."
Yes, they would know some day soon.
After a little pause, Sir Walter remarked
to his wife-
"I shall be curious to watch that young
man's reappearance on the surface. He has
taken the plunge which so many take-has
gone to London ; has dived for some pearl.
By-the-by, you know that beautiful girl,
Miss Whitsund—Dr. Marlowe Harding's
ward. She is engaged to him. That ac-

counts for the numerous refusals. The
doctor—Cuthbert's uncle—was, I under-
stand, bitterly against the match ; but he
has come to a compromise. The young
man, if within three years, he can offer
certain pecuniary terms, may marry the girl,
who will then be twenty ; if he fail to meet
his uncle's wishes in respect to money, the
youth has promised to release the lady
altogether from her engagement. Mean-
while, however, this entanglement has
sufficed to break off, unconditionally and
definitively, another alliance, on which my
old friend, Mr. Childering, from whom I
have it all, had set his heart."
“With his son, Algernon, I suppose,” said
Lady Mandeville, “who is going to stand
for the county.”
“Yes, only he is not going to stand,”
replied Sir Walter ; " that is all given up."
“What, papa !” cried little Henrietta,
whose presence had been forgotten during

this conversation. “Algy loving a lady
that poor Mr. Cuthbert is going to marry !
I could not think it of Algy. Why should
he take away poor Mr. Cuthbert's marry,
and poor Mr. Cuthbert so sad ?
“Then he has no money; or why would
papa say that he has three years given him
to satisfy his uncle in money ? Now I know
why Mr. Cuthbert was so sad, and why he
must be busy in life, busy."

CHAPTER X.
MIL
Young Harding, when ready to proceed “for
good,” as it is said, to London, went, the day
before, to Childering Hall, ostensibly in order
to thank Algernon for the great service he
had received from that youth, and, by
thanking, to learn was it he whom he really
had to thank. But Cuthbert was prompted,
also, by another motive in his visit.
He was shown into a waiting room, in
which heaps of packages lay about with
“A. C.” on them. After a few minutes' delay,
the door opened, and the two young rivals
confronted each other,
Cuthbert adverted, with an apology, to the

letter which he had sent, and which, he
admitt«, was justly termel so "foolish by
his corrispondent, Algernon interrupteul
him.
"Do not allude to it," said he ; "it is
forgotten, I assure you. But you must
expuse me. I am extremely busy now with
— with my father, and I am just starting for
town,"
"So am I," replied Cuthbert; «that is,
to-morrow. But there was another suba
Algernon colour /
"Xot now," said he, “I pray you. You
may be content, surely, with your advan-
"My advantages * exclaimed Muthbert.
* I do not understand. Your advantage has
been so great that, I think, it would allow a
little generosity --"
"Oh! you are alluding again to that affair
the other night. You would have done just

the same in my place. And, since you have
been so successful— "
“I came here,” cried Cuthbert, “in cour-
tesy and in good feeling, but not to submit
myself to scoffs.”
Algernon gazed at him in amazement, and
at the same time, hastened to say-
“You are, I see, under some extraordinary
delusion ; but I have not one instant to
spare. Since you, too, are going to London,
could you not call on me there? I shall be
at Long's.”
As he spoke, he moved towards the door
offering his hand to Cuthbert. The latter
followed, taking the hand after a second's
hesitation, and saying-
..“Will you explain ?"
“Yes, yes,” replied Algernon. “I have
nothing which I care to conceal from you in
the matter."
“You allude to-to- ” said Cuthbert.
“Yes, to that,” returned Algernon.
101

147
"Not to the adventure the other night,
not to my accident ?”
“No, of course not. I wish you what joy
a defeated man may.”
And so they parted. Cuthbert, in great
astonishment; Algernon, thoughtful, but not
at all disposed to indulge the little weakness
of pretending to a rival, for a short while, to
be more successful than he was. Such “a
triumph” he would not have regarded as a
triumph at all ; nor, if it could have pleased
him, would he have bought that pleasure by
inflicting a cruelty which could, to say the
least of it, have done himself no good. But
more than this; he was so absurdly primitive
as to fancy that he owed to Cuthbert, even
in the interest of the lady who had refused
him, any explanation which a misapprehen-
sion on Cuthbert's part of how she had
behaved, might seem to need.
When Cuthbert had said to Miss Whit-
sund, in Dr. Harding's presence—“ You

want a sacrifice on my part, in order that
you may be happy : I, a sacrifice on yours,
in order that I may not be wretched,” etc.,
in what light would he have regarded her
happiness so procured ? With rage. The
very thought of it made him nearly mad.
One of the first places to which he made
his way in town was Long's. Algernon had
left a note for him, saying that he was unex-
pectedly obliged to pass on through town,
but begging him to give his own address to
the porter, and promising as early a call as
was possible. Although burning with im-
patience to have the promised explanation
with Algernon, Cuthbert could not otherwise
hasten the hour of it; and, accordingly, he
did as he was requested.
He then endeavoured to put the subject
out of his mind by plunging into a multi-
tude of projects, which had, at least, the
merit of affording him a pleasing excitement.
That excitement was of a nature to grow by

M-

149
what it fed on, and it was destined soon to
reach a rather momentous pitch.
Meanwhile, Emily Whitsund had sought,
on her side, to put out of her head another
subject, and by other means. She tried to
think of Cuthbert in proportion as he tried
not to think of her (except when he would
do so for hours in a peculiar manner). They
were not successful in the same way, nor in
the same degree. She dwelt on his merits ;
she even brought herself so far as to con-
sider that he might have had something,
poor fellow, to complain of. He would have
agreed with her there. The very sternness
of Dr. Harding pleaded for him, secretly,
with such a character. She had, by a violent
effort over her mind, and by disregarding
herself as much as was absolutely allowable,
endeavoured to look at the whole of her
relations with him from his position. That
was precisely what he did himself. She
reasoned with herself; she took up his

cause ; she would not be wanting, if a certain
fate seemed to bave somehow shaken itself
down before her in the guise of a duty.
He had written to her. The letter, it is
true, was not quite in tune with her feelings.
Passion enough, indeed, and to spare, there
was. But what meant all that almost fierce
insistance on the means which his wife should
one day find herself enjoying ? She did
not want all these things. “This is love,
Cuthbert; or, if love holds the pen, pride
dictates the thoughts; it was not all this
that ever charmed me.”
Then he wrote again, and said it was
for her sake. She sighed, but she thought
very kindly indeed of her old playmate.
And, under the circumstances, she would
not have been quite happy with Algernon ;
she was sure that the remembrance would
intrude itself, that this happiness had cost
a great deal of wretchedness elsewhere.
Meanwhile Cuthbert had yet to learn what

151
she had sacrificed, how she had really
acted, while his love was so intensified
for the moment by another feeling—that
of jealousy.
One day, having a great deal on his
hands, and having already made acquaint-
ance with London in many ia strange nook,
by many a devious expedition, it happened
that he met his uncle, Dr. Harding. The
doctor shook hands with him, and then
went on his way. Cuthbert loitered.
“Is young Mr. Childering returned ?"
asked Cuthbert.
“No, sir; but there are heaps of letters
for him. We expect him every day. Any
hour, I may say."
“Has any one called for him to-day?"
“Yes, sir; just this moment. Here
is a card a gentleman left only an instant
since."
And the man showed Cuthbert his uncle's
card.

Young Harding tore a leaf out of his
pocket-book, wrote the day of the month,
with the words, “third call,” underneath,
then his name, and, giving the man this
and his card, with half a crown, in order
to make sure of his not forgetting, sauntered
forth.
He had not gone twenty yards when he
met Mr. George Childering, whom he knew
through Lord Havisfling (with whom again
he had scraped, on pretext of thanking him
for the service rendered the night he was
attacked, an acquaintance, not destined “ to
end there,” as the saying is)—he met, I
say, Mr. George Childering, whom he would
have preferred to avoid. But Mr. George
would not be avoided.
“You are the very fellow I wanted,
Harding,” observed that gentleman ; "are
you going to your den in St. James's ?”
“No,” said Cuthbert, hesitatingly, think-
ing, “you are not the fellow I want.”

“Well, when can I find you there? I
want you to do me a service. You will
be at home this evening ?”
“Why, yes; I shall be at home. But
I doubt I shall not be able to do the service
you speak of.”
“Well, how can you tell that? You
will let me explain it, I suppose ?”
“I think you have explained already ;
but as you please. When shall I expect
you ?”
“I have to dine with some of ours, and
you know I'm a bit of a blood,” returned
the refined individual ;“ but I'll slip away.
You may expect me between nine and ten.”
“Good,” replied Harding, already lost in
his own thoughts, and, moving off with a
wave of the hand which nobody would have
supposed to belong to “a cub” fresh from
the society of the Geoffreys, but which
would very well suit him as a man some
ten years older, if he ever became such.

He was so absorbed, indeed, that, as he
was, a little while afterwards (having safely
passed Piccadilly) crossing the much less
crowded and less dangerous street in which
he had his office (office he called it, and
office it was), he did not perceive a rail-
way carrier's heavy van, which happened,
at that moment, to be rushing by with the
reckless speed particularly characteristic of
those vehicles. We may mention that
Cuthbert was knocked down by the shaft,
but with such force, and so much aside, as
to be sent out of reach of the wheels, which
would otherwise have terminated his career
in a painful manner. Picking himself up,
comparatively unhurt, he limped to the
steps before his door, which was open.
The porter was standing in the doorway,
and a messenger was leaving.
“Well, you have had an escape, sir !”
said the porter.
Cuthbert looked round suddenly, in a
peculiar manner, but said nothing.

The man followed Cuthbert into his room
(which was on the ground floor), holding
a note; and again repeated the exclamation,
varying it a little, thus-
“Well, that was a mercy, I am sure !”
Young Harding had approached the
window and was looking out when the
man said this; and, indeed, the man spoke
feelingly, and was out of breath with sympa-
thetic fright.
Cuthbert made no reply to the remark,
but, sighing heavily, asked, was there any-
thing for him.
“Only this bit of a note, sir, that a lad
left just as you was coming up the door.”
It was from Algernon, hastily scrawled
in pencil, announcing that he would call
at nine o'clock in the evening ; he had but
that instant come to town, he said.
“This is - horribly awkward,” thought
Cuthbert. “Those two will meet ! Well,
that is their affair."

THE street, like others in St. James's, was
shady_for the houses were tall—but noisy,
because it was paved with barricade stones.
The room was a large, plain, scantily
furnished, dingy old office, with a deep
wainscot and surbase of deal all round it.
Cuthbert seated himself in the leathern
chair before the massive table-desk, and was
at once deep in thought.
A knock and a ring at length startled
him. He pushed his chair back, thrust into
the “pigeon holes ” of the perpendicular
screen, which rose like a parapet in his
front, sundry papers less innocuous than

began himself to light the gas.
While doing this, he looked aside at his
visitor, and, instead of the person whom he
had expected, beheld the face of his friend,
Tom Falconer. Tom was short-sighted, and
wore spectacles.
When, having shaken hands, they were
seated, Falconer said —
“ Harding, although I have something
curious to mention, yet I have come to talk
to you—after this—on a subject that will
surprise you. But one needs a confidant
in life, doesn't one ?”
“One does,” replied Cuthbert, smiling ;
“or, as they say in the rural parts from
which I come, some do, and other some
don't.'”
“Ah!” rejoined Falconer, “I am aware
that you are other some; but we were

bitten yourself in the same way. That clear
business head is a curious combination with
such a heart as yours. Noble act that,

I'll be bound. Harding,” added Tom,
solemnly, “the tender passion is not, and
never was, in your line. You never were
in love-you don't know what it is ; you're
all for those Smithfield drinking houses, and
that sort of thing—the drovers' house of
call,' and "
“Excuse me, Falconer,” interrupted Hard-
ing ; "we can come to the love in a minute.
Have there been any more nibblings about
those two places, since 1 referred intending
purchasers to you ?”

"Frequent bites, even," answered Fal-
coner; “but I have no authority from you
to conclude anything under-_”.
“Quite right,” returned Harding : “not
yet—not yet. Now for the love !”.
“No,” replied Falconer ; "a word first :
you have put a subject into my head-learn
that I recreate myself from my work by
studying character. Now, my dear fellow,
you are a study. I understand you
thoroughly : an easy, calm, benevolent,
quiet person. That's the reason you like
money. A man must like something in
life. I've said this to myself, when I was
' plumbing' you, as I may call it-forgive
the operation. A man must like something;
and you like making money, in order to do
good with it, as in the case of that foreigner.
That is all very well. But what on earth
put it into your head to invest in the land-
lordship of a Smithfield tavern, and of that
low' house of call for drovers ?' And how

could you think that a profit was to be
made of such a purchase ?”
“There is a profit, you see,” replied Hard-
ing quietly. “If I had commissioned you
to resell this very day, I should have realized
how much ?”
“Some hundreds,” answered Falconer,
airily, and, as it were, superiorly ; "yes, yes,
I know that the fact is so. But, excuse
me, I am nervous for you, with your inex-
perience in these matters, and your natural
simplicity. Money is a ticklish affair, be-
lieve me. The idea, now of your just hap-
pening to meet the landlord in a railway
carriage, and hearing him abuse the papers
for creating a panic about Smithfield market.
Why, there was a panic, Harding : all the
journals, all the press, were and are agreed
about the necessity of removing the market
out of the midst of this too crowded metro-
polis, and then what becomes of property
of that sort-shambles no longer shambles ?

No wonder the man was prudent in time,
and desired to sell—the wonder is, that you
should buy. It has succeeded this time, I
admit; but do be cautious, that's a good
fellow.”
"I will,” said Cuthbert. “By-the-by,
that private bill which Mr. Bradworth is
getting through the House ——”.
“Ah!” exclaimed Falconer," there's
another precious idea. Because you find
people complaining of parliamentary agents
as so many sharks, you conclude it must be
a good thing to be a parliamentary agent,
and you go and get up the whole business in
no time. If it were a regular profession, like
the Bar, I grant you. A pro-fession,” added
Tom, with dignity, “is a pro-fession ; but
you'll only burn your fingers this way, in
the end—mark my words. Now, there is
Lord Havisfling, again—what can you do
with such a man as that? Head and ears
involved—no sense, you know. If it had

been a clever, rich peer, his friendship and
influence would advance a man, of course.
But Havisfling ! Everything in the grip of
usurers—fifteen per cent. My dear Hard-
ing, why waste your naturally good intelli-
gence on such a ruin? And then your
style of doing it--"
“I am aware, of course, that you would
never play the usurer, even if you had the
requisite capital,” continued Tom. “And I
fully allow that it is well to consult an ex-
cellent heart; but to let it carry one away
in a mere business transaction, and to seek
in the other direction-I mean, in imposing
a lower rate of interest—the means of making
one's own fortune, this I call being trans-
ported by instinctive kindness of disposition,
with a vengeance. It is being too good;
and—you must pardon my wit-on my
honour, it is also too bad. :
“The transfer of creditors has been effected,
however," observed Harding, who seemed

amused ; " and the difference between the
fifteen per cent, and the ten per cent. actu-
ally restores to Lord Havisfling a positive
income: a commodity which he had ceased
to possess.”
“Oh! I fully grant you the particular
facts,” replied Falconer, resuming his gravity
with gentle earnestness. “It is only the
obliging tendency in general which you have
to guard against. Besides, Lord Havisfling
is a gainer-but you ?”
“Well,” returned Cuthbert, contentedly,
“I got my commission from Messrs. Hum-
bold, who superseded Messrs. Issachar. Even
the reduced interest was ample enough to
induce them to allow me a very handsome
bonus. But let us talk of love. That was
a mere case of reckless mismanagement recti-
fied into a more moderate mismanagement.
Let us talk, I repeat, of this love of yours
for some lady."
“One word more," said Falconer. “I

have a very curious thing to tell you.” And
he looked knowingly at Harding.
“What curious thing ?” asked Harding.
“Why,” resumed Falconer, “when I first
went to Messrs. Humbold, according to your
instructions, I found that they referred to
you as Lord Havisfling's agent in this busi-
ness."
“Ay ?” said Cuthbert, puckering his lips.
“That was all very well and very right,”
pursued Falconer. “But, only conceive,
when I then saw Lord Havisfling, he would
persist in alluding to you as the agent of
Messrs. Humbold !”
“What did you say ?” demanded Cuth-
bert.
“Say? I said—My lord, you will par-
don me,' said I ; “the expression I used was
legally correct. My friend, Mr. Cuthbert
Harding, pending this transaction, may be
styled your lordship's own agent, in good
phrase of law.'”

165
“What did he say?" again demanded
Cuthbert.
“ Harding," returned Falconer, emphati-
cally, “ he said a thing that was not cour-
teous—no, not if he were twice a Peer.
“Is this the curious thing you had to tell
me?”
“Yes,” remarked Falconer. “Messrs.
Humbold knew you for his lordship’s agent,
and you were so. What makes it the more
odd is, that my lord himself should not only
have been ignorant of, or should have forgot-
ten this circumstance, but actually talked of
you as the agent of the opposite party in the
negotiation.”
“Well,” observed Cuthbert, “it does not
signify; he will not make that mistake any
more; he is so content with what I did for
him in this affair, that I am now to be the
agent of his estates, with, of course, the use
of the rents for half a year at a time, more
or less, besides the percentage.”

“My goodness !” cried Falconer ; “why,
that is worth I don't know how many
briefs.”
“Without a pro-fession,” said Cuthbert,
dropping the words out in a sort of drawl,
and with a thoughtful look. “Talking of
briefs, do you begin to get many ?”
“Oh! lately,” said Falconer, “I have
been doing very well. Those cases—but,
bless me, you know all about them : it was
you who threw them in my way. This may
have put it into my head that the time is
come, for which I have waited very patiently.
And so has she.”
“Ah! tell me about that,” replied Cuth-
bert; " for although I am not exactly in the
line, as you say, I have sympathy for a
friend."
Tom then gave a hitch to his spectacles,
and said
“She was my first brief, Harding-my
very first. And I would not take a sixpence

for the world when I carried her through-
which I had the good fortune to do most
triumphantly. She and her mother were
grateful. That began it.”
“The name was ?” said Cuthbert.
“And is,” returned Falconer, “although
it will not always be—Lucy Derwent. She
has accepted me. She is slight, small, and
so pretty—beautiful, I call her; but the
mother is not exactly what you would term
a fine woman, being rather big ; but she is
so good—there is not an ounce of harm in a
ton of her.”
“That is a great point,” observed Cuth-
bert; “still there is not a ton of her, I hope.
And, as to property ?”
“Well,” replied Tom, “not much of that.
There is what I saved for them according to
the marriage settlement, in the case of
Derwent versus Derwent. You must have
heard of the case.”
“I have had so much on my hands,” ex-
postulated Cuthbert.

“True, very true,” said Falconer; “it
will have escaped you. But it was a cruel
case, I assure you. I tell the mother that
she has treasure enough in having such a
daughter; and, as to the daughter, she will
enrich me in any case, you know.”
“I am glad of that,” said Cuthbert.
“I felt sure you would be,” responded
Tom: " she is an estate in herself.”
“Oh !” said Cuthbert ; “I thought you
meant—- But I see now: impossible to be
more amiable.”
“Impossible !” said Tom, expansively
“ Their little establishment itself is all one
fragrance of goodness. Like mistress, like
servant. The little girl, I say, who waits on
them, would be enough to make you guess
what sort of people they are."
“Really ?” ejaculated Cuthbert, with in-
terest.

girl did not see me, but was returning from
some message, just before me—and I declare
I was quite struck as I noticed her primming
along, with a large hole in her shoe, and
a high sense of decorum.”
“Excellent !” said Cuthbert.
“I thought you would see it,” resumed
Falconer; “ knows whom she serves. But
Harding, Harding, I was so annoyed, yester-
day—I was on fire."
“What happened ?"
“Two things happened,” continued Fal-
coner. “I had persuaded Lucy and her
mother to take a walk with me, and the
conversation turned upon general subjects,
until it came to books, and Lucy asked me
what I would recommend? And, as I took
some time to turn that point over in my
mind, Lucy then playfully demanded what
were my own books of entertainment, what
modern, what recent things? Well,' said I,

«« Chitty's Practice” is not a bad thing, when
one is tired; “Sugden on Vendors,” too, is a
sweet book,' said I.”
“What a very apt remark of yours !” cried
Cuthbert. “Is that the large volume I
always see on the right of your—–”.
“No, no,” interrupted Falconer; "you
are thinking of 'Blackstone's Commentaries'
—(nice light reading, that). But let me
tell you what occurred in the fields : a
fellow—a scoundrel, I may call him—very
handsome, well dressed, but a cadaverous
thing-meets us; it was near the road, and
his private cab and tiger were waiting for
him over the stile. And he stops and stares.
at Lucy. Stares, Harding, stares at her.”
“Villain!” observed Cuthbert.
“And he said,” pursued Falconer, who
became pale with agitation, “ he said, as he
turned and looked right under her bonnet-
he actually said, loud enough for us all to
hear him— Devilish pretty girl, that.'”

“What did you do ?” asked Harding.
“Do? what could I do? But I heard his
name. At least, a friend of his, lounging
near the cab, addressed him (with an oath
for delaying) as Hildering or Wildering, or
something like it."
“It was not Childering ?”
“Yes, it was,” cried Tom. “And then,
just as we were re-entering the cottage, after
our walk, I happened to look round, and
what should I behold, dogging us at a safe
distance ?”
“What ?” asked Cuthbert.
“To ask you to guess is useless,” resumed
Tom: “you never would—you are too
simple. It was that scoundrels tiger. Think
of that! I could almost have doubled my
fist."
Cuthbert with difficulty restrained a smile,
but he succeeded.
“Very annoying,” said he. “But you
mentioned that there was a second thing
which had put you out.”

“Ah! yes,” returned Falconer. “It was
quite an evening of vexations. I wore this
large, loose, light-coloured coat—which I
consider very stylish and of a lively, wake-
up character—and I keep it buttoned, so.
It gives you rather the appearance of a
dashing, desperate sort of fellow—and the
women like that, you know. To tell you
the truth, it was an innocent imposture,
designed to have a certain effect on Lucy;
for she is imaginative-yea, romantic. It
would show her that her lover was not a
heavy, dull dog, you understand ?”
“Perfectly,” replied Harding, with gravity.
“ And, perhaps, she told you, after all, that
she did not think it became you?”
“Ah! it was worse than that,” re-
sponded Tom, sighing. “ Indeed, I have
my reasons for thinking that the coat would
have pleased Lucy herself; although, at
first, she used to steal a look at me, every
now and then, as I sauntered in an easy,

graceful manner by her side. She has a sly
humour of her own, and all would have gone
off famously, but for a slight incident. One
of those shameless urchins that you meet
everywhere—a butcher's boy, I think-was
coming along the path, whistling. When he
saw me, he stopped and said, “My eye!
there's a coat !' With great tact, I began
to talk loud, to prevent Lucy dwelling on
his words ; but she happened to be seized
with a fit of coughing, and had her hand-
kerchief to her mouth, so that she did not
notice. But that young demon waited for
us. I looked sternly at him, as we passed,
in order to overawe him; and guess what
he cried out."
“ I'm sure I cannot,” said Cuthbert.
“ Harding,” resumed Tom, much moved,
“ he called out—' Who wants a coachman ?'
In vain I tried to look unconscious. Lucy
looked at me from head to foot with one
more of those sly glances of hers, and actually

burst out laughing—I remaining lofty, grave,
dignified, but hurt, Harding—hurt!”
A silence of half a minute followed this
touching communication.
“Of course it is made up," Tom then
said ; “and all that is wanting, in order to
name the day, is a certain sum of money.
I have nearly reached it. A few more
months of hard work, and I'm all right.
Marriage is a great responsibility in life,
Harding.”
“How soon do you think,” asked Cuth-
bert, after a pause, “that you will have
achieved this saving ?”.
“In a year, or a year and a half, even at
my present rate of practice,” replied Falconer.
“I want only two hundred and twenty
pounds of it now.”
“ Then get the day named at once, and
I'll come to the wedding,” cried Cuthbert;
“ for on this day two months you shall have
-I will advance you—the needful, and
await the balance myself.”

Tom sprang from his chair, into which
Cuthbert immediately forced him down
again, by main force, saying-
“If you utter one word on the subject,
you insult me!”
“ Insult you !” gulped out poor Falconer
-"insult you! Oh! Harding, I–I—-”.
“Yes; insult me,” interposed the other ;
“I know what I can do, and what I am
doing. You would not wish to insult me,
I know. Therefore consider this matter as
settled; and say not a word.”
“A gentleman for you, sir," said the
porter, opening the door.
The stranger entered as Falconer went
out; and Falconer went out so flustered that
he never noticed who came in. But the
door was immediately opened again, and
Tom thrust in his head.
“ Harding,” said he, “ I must speak, or I
shall choke. You are--"
Notwithstanding that he “must speak,"
he could not.

Falconer's spectacles were dim, as he
walked to his solitary chambers that evening.
Harding perceived that his new visitor
was not Mr. Algernon, but the elder brother,
Mr. George Childering.
“I have come before my time,” remarked
that easy personage ; and then he proceeded
to explain to Cuthbert that, in order to
save trouble and time, and, above all, any
discussion—(a thing which he said he could
not stand)—he had just jotted down on a
bit of paper what he wanted Harding to do
for him, and under what circumstances.
"I would rather that you looked over it
in my absence, and when I return—after
dining-you can then answer me with
merely 'yes' or ‘no.”
“Very well,” said Cuthbert, taking the
paper coldly.
“You will perceive, or you will guess,"
continued Childering, “that marriage is
mixed up in my plans. Marriage, Harding,
is a great card in life!”.

Cuthbert, curiously enough, was, at that
moment, pondering on Tom's remark, that
marriage“ was a great responsibility in life”
-and the difference between the expressions
struck him. Which of them struck him
the more will soon appear.
Mr. George Childering was a singular
mixture. A common fool may have un-
common abilities. Folly much rather con-
sists in the misapplication of talent and of
sense, than in the want of them.
Here were two young men, in that dingy
old office, both of whom had very consider-
able, and, indeed, one of them, very extra-
ordinary powers ; and yet which was the
more deluded fool, it would be perplexing
to determine. Cuthbert, who was the
superior of the two in force and vividness
of mind, or of intellect, was probably the
worse fool in reality.
But, at least, he betrayed not his folly in
the same obvious manner as did Mr. George
48

HARDING
Childering. His conversation showed no
levity or incoherency of mind.
“Yes,” pursued Mr. George, “marriage
is a great card, in certain cases. This is a
widow: young, pretty, and rich. Her hus-
band, an old fogy, died some twenty
months ago, and was found to cut up as-
tonishingly.”
“Cut up!” said Cuthbert. “That is ”
“Left her,” retorted Childering, “an orna-
ment to society. He surprised the world at
his death."
“Sudden, I suppose,” said Cuthbert.
“Don't know, I'm sure,” returned Chil-
dering. “He died worth nearly a hundred
thousand pounds.”
Here Childering rose, yawned, stretched
himself, and took his hat, observing, in con-
clusion-
“Well, you will look over those docu-
ments? I shall come back some time.”
“Not to-night?” said Cuthbert, thinking
of Algernon's appointment.

“Yes, to-night,” said Childering, quickly.
“Do you think I could wait till to-morrow
to know my fate?”
“You are so in love with this widow,"
said Cuthbert.
“I am in love with nothing," returned
the other; “but- ” And he added
something about Derwent.
“There is one thing,” observed Cuthbert,
gravely, “which I would impress on you,
. and that is, the necessity of dropping your
amusements in that quarter. They will
give annoyance."
“ Annoyance ! ” cried Childering, who
was now going out, but stopped. “That is
the best part of it. If you had seen the
youth-
"
“I know him,” said Cuthbert ; "and it is
not with him you will have to do.”
“With whom, then, I pray you ? ” de-
manded Childering, haughtily.
“With me!” returned Harding.

The other looked fixedly and in silence at
him. Harding returned the glance with
quiet meaning.
“What I you really dare !” said Childering.
“That is a mere flattering of yourself,”
observed Cuthbert. “There is no daring in
the matter. If there were,” added he, slowly,
and with a smile, “why, I believe, I could
dare considerably more than that.”
“What am I to understand ?” asked
Childering
“That I request you not to annoy Miss
Lucy Derwent,” said Cuthbert, with a great
emphasis on the word request.
“In other words, such are your orders,”
remarked Childering.
Cuthbert reflected a moment, and then
said-
“It is not like a man of the world to in-
sist on making me less courteous than I wish
to be. My own preference is for the word I
have used. I again request you.”

Childering's cadaverous face turned a
bright crimson. Controlling himself, with a
prodigious effort, he said-
“Good-bye for the present; good-bye, in
all amity, my dear fellow. I will see you
again to-night.”

CHAPTER XII.
He had been gone about two hours, when
his brother Algernon was shown into Cuth-
bert's room.
“You wanted to speak with me," said
Algernon, as soon as he had seated himself
in the chair which his brother had just
occupied.
"I wanted to ask you,” said Cuthbert,
“what you meant when you spoke of my
advantage over you, or of my success ?”
“Well, it was but an inference of mine,"
replied Algernon. “I ought, perhaps, to
have said, my own defeat.”
“ Your defeat !” said Cuthbert. “Do for-
give me, but is it to our rivalry—o—to
Miss Whitsund you allude ?”

“Yes ; to her reception of my addresses,”
returned Algernon. “I thought I might
talk of your success, since me she has
rejected.”
“Rejected you !” exclaimed Cuthbert.
“Well, but that was no reason why I should
not express my sorrow to you for an insane,
an unworthy, provocation.”
“It is forgiven twice over, long since,” re-
plied Algernon. “You will, no doubt,
marry this lady. Marriage is a great respon-
sibility in life.” (Falconer's very words,
thought Cuthbert.) “I could, I imagined,
have rendered her existence happy. Do you
no less."
“We are ridiculous mortals,” said Cuth-
bert; “and I want a promise from you.
Without flattery, you are a competitor to
dread. True, the promise seems superfluous ;
but it would be a great satisfaction to

me-
“ What is it?” asked Algernon.

“That you will never, during my lifetime,
renew your addresses to, or hold even any
communication whatsoever with, Miss Whit-
sund ?”
“That costs me—loses me, nothing, I
believe,” returned Algernon, “and I give it
to you freely.”
“Give me your hand on it."
“There it is,” said Algernon, “and my
solemn word of honour to boot.”
“I am content, now,” said Harding, with
a smile ; “ for my life you are bound fast.”
And he wrung his visitor's hand.
“I am going abroad,” said Algernon. “I
shall probably be years away. Farewell!”.
Before he reached the door, it was thrown
open with some violence, and Mr. George
Childering entered.
“Is it done, or is it undone, Harding ?”
demanded he.
“Not done to-night,” said Cuthbert. “I
have had no time yet.”

“That's unhandsome,” said Childering,
who now noticed his brother, with whom he
quarrelled about his conduct at the election,
till Cuthbert interposed.
Algernon then coloured violently, but
said with a smile-
“We knew how to give and take once,
did we not, dear George ? I believe that
you love me at heart, in spite of all you can
do; only you fancy I set myself up as your
superior. The thought never came near me ;
and now that you force me to look at it, I
must confess that it might seem so. You
are able to beat me in fifty things, in which
you do not care to try, and never did care.”
The elder brother smiled, and gave his
hand.
“There,” said he; “you are going away.
Perhaps we shall never meet again.”
Within a week, Cuthbert sold the pro-
perty, to which Falconer had alluded ; and
the profit far more than covered what he had

HARDING
lent to Falconer. For a long time, Cuthbert
Harding prospered more and more, while
still playing what may be termed the private
game. His reinvestments, after he had be-
come Lord Havisfling's agent, were almost
all great successes; but he thus got a habit
of impatient and restless reinvestment; and
his more public game was about to begin.
He brought to it extensive resources; but he
brought, also, the dangerous help of surrep-
titious information--a Traitor's periodical
hints. The Traitor was a great man's pri-
vate secretary ; and it was to his master, or
chief, the secretary was a Traitor.
One night, Cuthbert—who had established
an understanding with this individual, mak-
ing his rewards conditional upon, and pro-
portionate to, results—was awakened by a
violent ringing.
It was the official Traitor, with a hint
about a certain provision in the coming
budget. Cuthbert acted on the hint. An

187
incredible profit was realized thus at a single
blow. The Traitor's first hint was valuable.
But his second hint was yet to come ;
once more, Cuthbert was to hear that bell in
the dead of night. Once more, he was to
act according to “office” thus obtained—
staking this time on the issue, fortune, love,
and life itself.
Meanwhile, his public game had begun.
Disposing of such enormous deposits as his
own multifarious accounts, swoln by the
temporary use of Lord Havisfling's rents,
enabled him to command, his custom was of
immense importance to the bank which he
favoured. He was not only its best man,
but worth to it any three other of its
depositors; and, with a few exceptions,
indeed, any ten of them together. It was
natural he should become a director-natural
be should be able to introduce into the
direction friends who could form resolutions
sure to pass.

HARDING
But this was miserably short of his require-
ments. He had taken care, as early as
possible, to make good the ground in his
rear, by scrupulously discharging the single
curious obligation which galled his remem-
brance, though it had aided his start.
About fifteen months after Cuthbert's first
departure for London, Sir Walter Mandeville
happened to meet Mr. William Harding in

“The fourteen hundred pounds. You

“Excuse me,” retorted Mr. William ;

“but I have not the remotest notion of what
you mean.”
“Your letter was a very proper one ;
indeed, both your letters ; but we need not
continue the subject,” remarked Sir Walter.
“So you sold the brewery to enormous
advantage ? Extraordinary incident that,
at the auction! Odd conduct of Brompton!”
They parted, after a few more enigmatica)
exchanges of good words. Sad and even
tremendous was the reflection to Mr. Hard-
ing, as Cuthbert's father-sad, but chiefly as
giving him uneasy and vigilant interest in
the young Money-spinner's movements.
Meanwhile, Cuthbert himself never put
sword in scabbard; for being victorious, it
blazed in the restless right hand, at the van
of a thousand hazards.
Referring to his position as new director
in an old bank, he said to himself-
“It strikes me now," quoth he, “that this
is but little, my beloved Emily! Lord

Nelson vowed he would one day have a
Gazette of his own; and so I vow I'll have
now a bank of my own !”
He had reached the time, when—taciturn,
absent, pale, and even haggard—he found
way made for him and his eternal black bag,
with the Chubb lock, among the thrones and
principalities of Mammon. He had reached
this stage in his career, when, one evening,
wending his way homewards, to a western
palace, he meditated a decisive action : but,
ere writing to Emily, he was destined now
for the second time to hear the Traitor's bell
ring at his door in the dead of night.

CHAPTER XIII.
TAE reader has seen that Cuthbert Harding's
social position was in a hundred ways
changed since that bright and beautiful
afternoon of an English June, when he
and Geoffrey Mandeville had arrived from
Eton, ignorant and happy, at the pretty town
of Huntingferry.
About seven years had elapsed. Little
Henrietta Mandeville was eighteen—Emily
Whitsund, nearly twenty-four. Mr. William
Harding was no longer in trade ; and Miss
Winnifrid Harding (a brilliant, witty, warm-
hearted, and even beautiful, girl of seven-
teen) was whispered among the rising youth
to be a great “catch," as the Money-spinner's
sister.

HARDING
He had arrived at the day, on the night
succeeding which, he was destined to hear,
for the second time, the Traitor's bell at
the dead, silent hour.
Venturesome as he was, he had never,
save once, and never legitimately, ventured
so much as on that day; and now, in the
afternoon, he slowly took his way, on foot,
through the streets of London, towards his
new and very fine house in the neighbour-
hood of Westbourne Terrace.
When Harding, having knocked at his
own door, had been admitted, and had cast
a hurried glance over the cards and notes
which littered his hall table, jerking them
peevishly from him again, a footman ap-
proached, and said,
“Mr. Rosebriar has called three 'casions,
sir; am I to say you's at home, when he
comes a second time?”
.
Harding, flinging down his hat on the
table with a heavy sigh, passed on, without

replying, into the library. The man fol-
lowed, and repeated his question.
“When he comes again,” said Harding,
“ show him in here."
As Cuthbert threw himself into his chair,
when left alone, he muttered—“Rosebriar !
Rosebriar! Where have I met that man,
before he found me out in the City ?”
The servant, whose name was Saunders
(a big son of the little old postboy, that
formerly carried the letter bag of Mandeville
Park), remarked, as he lounged in the hall,
to the butler-
“Our master looks thundering queer. I
don't think all's easy everywhere with him.
I don't like it, mind you.”
“What’s amiss, young man ?” returned
the porter ; “ the wages is good.”
“The wages is good !” said Saunders,
who could read and write ; “I don't say
different. But I like to see more of the
sun in a master's face.”


## p. 194 (#202) ############################################

HARDING
“ Well !” said the porter.
A fidgety, uncertain knock came to the
door that evening; and Saunders, opening
the library, announced to Cuthbert Harding
-“Mr. Rosebriar.”
As the servant withdrew again, his foot
rustled against a bit of paper. He took it
to the light, in the hall, and perceived it
was an open letter. Before he knew what
to do with it, his eye was caught by the
name of “ Mandeville,” so familiar to him,
and, without the least wish to pry, he saw
these words—“ You, as my daughter, Hen-
rietta Mandeville's trustee.”
At that moment the library door opened
precipitately, and Mr. Rosebriar came peer-
ing into the hall.
“Did you drop a letter, sir ? ” inquired
Saunders, who had folded it again.
“Ah !” said Mr. Rosebriar, “I feared it
might be in the street,” and he seized the
letter, with a sort of hungry eye, and was
back in the library immediately.


## p. 195 (#203) ############################################

THE MONEY-SPINNER.

The words, "you as Henrietta Mande-
ville's trustee,” were of no importance to
Saunders. But what would not Cuthbert
Harding have given, to have seen them ?
More than Saunders could have believed to
be in the gift of less than a duke.
Mr. Rosebriar was again in the library,
and an eager, hungry, glance hovered and
fluttered over Cuthbert's haggard face, as
Mr. Rosebriar leant with an elbow on the
chimney-piece.
“Where have you seen me ?” said he.
“I know not; until I met you on that
business, I never met you, that I'm aware.”
“And you are pleased with that business ?”
asked Harding.
“How could I be otherwise ? " returned the
visitor. “The profits were enormous. I am
very glad, indeed, that I trusted to your
judgment. The fact is, I must be doing
something—it keeps me alive. Do you feel
as confident of the result this time?”


## p. 196 (#204) ############################################

196
HARDING
“As confident ?” replied Harding, slowly
_“I have examined this matter far more
carefully than the other.”
“Because,” said Mr. Rosebriar, “ I could
make my share in it larger. I have been
reflecting on what you said about my
scruple respecting trust-money.”
“Why, you should not benefit the person
whose welfare is entrusted to you, as well as
yourself,” replied Harding. “I remember
the argument. If, as trustee, no less than as
first and real owner, you had joined that busi-
ness, your trust ward would be richer, at
this moment. Is it not the fact ?”.
“Much richer,” replied Rosebriar.
“But,” resumed he, “I am differently cir-
cumstanced at present. All my own money
is gone—locked up in another affair, from
which it would be ruinous to draw it yet.
In brief, I could venture a very large sum-
but it is all trust-money this time.”
Harding wanted money, little as this was

imagined, and he cared not much for his
visitor's conscience.
“Do as you please,” said he; “that is
your consideration."
“I thought,” said the other, “it might be
an opportunity of compensating my ward in
trust for the former neglect; and I might
embargo out of the profit enough to pay my-
self for the anxiety and trouble, while still
enriching her.” .
“Her !” said Harding, carelessly ; "it is
a woman's, then. Do as you think best.
For my part, I do not see why you should
grudge benefiting your ward, any more than
yourself. I do not, indeed. And you can,
as you say, stop enough out of the proceeds
to indemnify pains taken.”
“How long will it be,” asked the other,
“ before we can realize ?”
“A matter of a fortnight, more or less,"
said Harding.
Next day Henrietta Mandeville's money

(not for an instant suspected to be hers, but
known, at least, to be trust), went out for a
short trip in a boat of Cuthbert Harding's,
which was really not certain ever to come to
port again.
Meanwhile, on the night that followed Mr.
Rosebriar's call, the Traitor who was the
statesman's secretary (not intentionally any
traitor to Harding, but to his own chief who
trusted him), came, as he had come once be-
fore, and gave Cuthbert very important in-
formation. Cuthbert had his foot entangled
here in a net of precisely the same sort as
that which, through his act, had ensnared
Mr. Rosebriar. As his first transaction with
the Traitor had prospered exceedingly, he
felt not a moment's hesitation in availing
himself of his information a second time;
and availing himself of it, he lost, at a single
blow, nearly five times the amount of Hen-
rietta's hazarded fortune. The chances
seemed auspicious.

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
199
Such was the Money-spinner's exact posi-
tion, when one evening, as before, he took
his way on foot to his house ; only in still
deeper gloom and abstraction.
Harding reached home, and with the same
peevish jerk, pitched his hat on the hall
table, and hastened to the library. Saunders
again remarked to the butler-
“I don't like it, mind you. Did you see
how he flung down the hat? Wages isn't
all.”
And the porter again said—“Well !”
Meanwhile, Harding was buried in his soli-
tary armchair. It was a foggy evening; a
fire burned in the grate; the shaded lamp
stood behind him on the large writing table;
and Harding stared at the fire, in deep
thought.
Did he then remember Emily, who for
him had sacrificed so much ? Yes, even
now he is meditating a great step in her
regard.

HARDING
There was a document, a deed, securely
locked in some strong box, in some fireproof
room, somewhere in or near Chancery Lane.
To Harding it had been worth comparatively
little, although the sum might sound for-
midable.
But now, powerful, honoured, and courted
as he was, he would have given twice the
sum, to hold that deed in his hand once
more for half a minute. Twice the sum !
Nay, he would have given this to know just
where it was.
But how long had he been so solicitous to
regain it ? Since its recovery was beyond
his power. Formerly it had been easy for
him to bave commanded its repossession.
But now he was positively unable, and, at
the bare thought, he shuddered from head to
foot.
He had bought of Lord Havisfling a small
property, situated in Lancashire; and Lord
Havisfling had another and larger, a much

201
larger property, situated in Yorkshire; the
deed of conveyance had been mortgaged by
Harding at a moment when his bank re-
quired propping up; and propped up the
bank was, for the time. So it was the deed
of the small Lancashire property which he
wanted to get back. The firm who had it
would have told you that it was the deed of
the large Yorkshire property, with the seals
on, duly signed, delivered and attested, but
the conveyance had not yet been registered.
Harding sat staring at the fire. He
thought of his uncle's cruel invective, and of
Emily; and it was with a strange, wistful
yearning that he recalled the old times, and
the old dreams, and the old projects, and the
plight exchanged in the sweet days of youth,
in the glorious morning time of life) under
the lowly hawthorn. He had once reminded
her of their castle building. Was it not
rather cottage building ?
“Why,” thought he, “ did I not stop
then ?—or then ?—or then?”

HARDING
While he was thus brooding, a slight in-
cident showed a great change in the Money-
spinner. The time had been, when no
catastrophe short of “the crack of doom”
could have produced any sudden or violent
effect on the outward man. But he now
literally bounded in his chair at the loud,
abrupt knock of the postman. It was the
last post delivery of the day. In some
matters, if it rains, it pours. When the ser-
vant entered with the letter, Harding did
not look round. When the servant had
gone, he tore open the seal with feverish
anxiety. It was a letter from the firm who
held the deed of conveyance, saying that
they did not want it taken up forthwith ;
but that an ugly rumour had reached them
about his country bank, and, unless he took
up the deed, they would send it to York to
be registered, the next day but one.
Harding had something to think of as
he stared at the fire that evening. He was

moving fast, although he was seated in that
armchair—and he was moving upon the
slippery brink of a dizzy height. The per-
spiration poured invisibly from the straining
brain, and a certain pull was felt inwardly
along his hitherto unconquerable nerves.
Without uttering them, the words now
rang in his ears—“Marriage is a great
card in life.” He had always preserved
and cultivated his relations with the Mande-
villes.
Little guessing whose was that trust
money which he had persuaded Mr. Rose-
briar to embark in a fatal venture- little
knowing what had become of Henrietta
Mandeville's fortune, and by whose act the
heiress was made portionless, he pushed
back his chair, took an envelope, which
he addressed to Emily Whitsund at his
uncle's rectory, and then placed before him
a sheet of letter paper which was to fill that
envelope, and to determine his destiny.

HARDING
But his hand, for more than an hour,
refused to write the words which would
terminate for ever that engagement for
which he had long battled so desperately
---and which he had hoped so soon to
change into a more final union.
Emily Whitsund was the only woman
whom he had ever loved. Henrietta Man-
de ville might feel an interest in Cuthbert,
but although he knew this interest, he
returned it not. Yet the fatal deed must
be recovered ; must not be registered. The
firm would grant him two months: he felt
certain of that. They had known from the
outset that it would never do for it to
transpire that he, Harding, had instantly
mortgaged an estate which he had only
just bought. Indeed, when borrowing on
the large Yorkshire property a sum which
more than covered all he had actually paid
for the small Lancashire estate, he had given
· that very pretext for stipulating that the

205
deed should not be registered. He would
get two months now. Within that time,
Henrietta's portion should rescue the deed.
Thinking it was better to settle the
point of respite or reprieve first, he sent
Saunders to the nearest cab-stand, and,
without writing his letter to Emily, drove
straight to the private residence of the
gentleman from whom he had received
the letter which had troubled him so
sorely. He got his two months, and ten
days to boot, that same night.
Once more in his library, he began and
finished, in a passion of tears, the letter
which resigned the only hand he prized
on earth for its own sake. But he could
not bring himself to post that letter im-
mediately. He tried. He went to the
post-office with it, held it over the re-
ceiving box. No; he could not do it.
After walking past the letter box more
than once, he finally resolved that he

ove
would keep the letter back for the ten
days which he had gained over and above
his two months.
During those ten days, an event which
would have been momentous, indeed, to
him, had he but guessed it, was being
worked out some three hundred miles away.
On the very night—when he was weep-
ing in solitude and secrecy over the fatal
letter, but yet writing it—on that very
night, the pickaxe turned up a vein of
iron and coal on a little property of Mr.
Brompton's, adjoining Emily's small estate
of Christ's Hope, for which he was
the agent. Following out the lode, he
satisfied himself, beyond all doubt, next
morning, that it was not his, but Miss
Whitsund's land, that was enriched with
the long unsuspected presence of these
chalybeate and carbonic treasures. An in-
defatigable, as well as keen man, he did
not rest, nor return home to Warwick-

207
shire, till he was able well to calculate
what this accession of value was really
worth. Previously, three thousand pounds
would have been thirty years' purchase of
Emily's little inheritance. He made up
his mind that he would purchase it, were
he to pay fifty thousand pounds. Alas !
the “ Money-spinner” was now so circum-
stanced that the fourth part of that sum
would have saved him for ever. But would
not Henrietta's fortune, also ?
On Mr. Brompton's return, he sounded
the doctor, who sounded Emily. Now, it
so happened, that she had been born on
that little northern domain, and that she
felt as if it would be breaking her heart
to part with it. So Mr. Brompton at once
had his “no” from the doctor.
But Mr. Brompton would not take a
“ no.” He rose in his price; and, as he
rose in his price, Dr. Marlowe Harding, who,
we need not say, was a very shrewd man,


## p. 208 (#216) ############################################

208
HARDING
began to suspect something. He taxed
Brompton, laughingly, with wanting to
cheat his ward; and Brompton replied
seriously that he never thought of taking
the property for so small a sum; that he
would pay down fifty thousand pounds for
it, ready money. The doctor, who had, at
first, deemed Emily demented for refusing
six, or even five thousand pounds, highly
commended her refusal of fifty thousand,
and said that such a matter required grave
consideration; whereupon, Mr. Brompton
smiled, nay laughed, made the best of it,
and told the truth. Emily Whitsund was
become one of the greatest heiresses within
a hundred miles round.
The knowledge of this momentous change
was not of a nature long to remain a secret ;
but at that moment it was confined, in its
various bearings and full appreciation, to
the four individuals collected in Doctor
Marlowe Harding's study; and they re-
as

solved that they would keep it to them-
selves for a little while. To London it
had, of course, had no time to penetrate ;
and, certainly, the Money-spinner in the
library of his fine West End house had
not the slightest glimmering suspicion of
the fact. What! to be honourable, merely
honourable, is to be safe! and to obey,
even romantically, the promptings of true
love, would be to triumph over all his
difficulties. How could he imagine this?
He had divided the time before him, as
though he had exactly two months and ten
days to live. Long before this epoch, he
had embarked what would have seemed to
many persons of independence half a dozen
little fortunes in the freight of a certain
ship, which had been bound, and had been
despatched, to the Eastern seas. If Cuthbert
Harding's hopes had been realized, she ought
to have returned, and placed him far above
the necessity of all the shifts to which he


## p. 210 (#218) ############################################

HARDING
was driven, with their crushing anxieties
and the mortal heartwound which those
shifts involved. The ship had, indeed, been
“spoken ” in the Indian Ocean, homeward
bound. But, alas ! she was already long
over due; and Harding, with his usual
firmness, had given her up; had assumed
her to be as a thing lost, and he would fight
on all the same. Yet, at moments, as he
sat in his evening solitariness, in that fine
house which he had bought for Emily, his
thoughts, despite of himself, were divided
between Emily and this forlorn hope ; and
his mind, after revisiting the old Warwick-
shire rectory, would, at a single bound, re-
turn to the Indian Ocean, and wander, in
imagination, over the waste of waters.
Then his spirit came back to his immediate
difficulties.
He, at length, determined, within two
months, to secure Henrietta Mandeville for
his bride, notwithstanding her father's re-

211
pugnance and her mother's secret uneasiness,
Geoffrey's goodwill he had never lost.
For the ten days in which he still cherished
the secret dreams which he was about to
dismiss for ever, he had not taken a single
step in his new plan. He had, indeed, on
one pretext or another, hurried to Mande-
ville Park, and slept a night there; and one
never to be forgotten evening had he made
Henrietta stamp deep his image upon her
confiding heart. He had allowed her to
learn—to guess—that, years ago, he had
been rejected by the lady to whom, in boy-
hood, he was engaged ; that, years ago, he
had been perfidiously treated ; and, years
ago, released from his too trustful illusion.
No; he was not released from it yet.
Beyond the step, however, just mentioned,
he had rigidly abstained from setting his
last resources in motion.
Meanwhile Henrietta's fortune was still in
jeopardy, but not lost, when Harding re-
turned to town.

HARDING
At length, the tenth day passed ; and
Harding re-opened and read once more his
letter to Emily Whitsund. It was the after-
noon of the second day after the interview
which has been described between Mr.
Brompton and the inmates of Doctor Hard-
ing's rectory.
This case was before Harding: should he
be faithful to the girl who had given up so
much for him, and whom he really loved ?
or, should he sacrifice her to the demon he
had hitherto worshipped ? The struggle was
terrible ; but Harding had not listened often
enough to one of the two inward voices
which now gave him opposite counsels, and
had listened too often to the other, to make
the decision doubtful; these things merely
made it painful—hitherto, his mental torture
was not past the relief of tears. Again he
wrote the same letter in meaning: and again
he broke into a passion of sobs. He threw
himself on the ground, and there lay for
hours.

If Emily only could have saved him-
but the deed! If she would have even
fied with him ; but she would some day
learn all about this deed. No-he must
give her up, and, in doing so, give up both
love and honour at the same moment, for
the sake of triumph over his difficulties, and
deliverance from his dangers.
At last he rose, composed his appearance,
took the fatal letter, and went into his
hall.
“Saunders,” said he, with an air of quietude
and indifference,“ take this letter to the
post.”
“ Yes, sir ; directly,” replied Saunders.
The master slowly and calmly returned
to his room; the man lounged and loitered
in the hall, uttering some more philosophy
to the butler.
Scarcely had Harding returned to his
lonely room, when a violent knocking at the
hall door made his heart thump against bis

ribs. A moment afterwards, Falconer rushed
into the apartment, pale and breathless.
“I congratulate you, my dear Harding !”
were the first words which the panting
visitor could gasp forth, as he seized Cuth-
bert's hand, and wrung it fervently.
“ What do you mean ?” asked Harding,
glaring upon Falconer, with a glance like a
spear.
“No mysteries with me!” panted forth
Falconer, holding his sides for want of
breath (he had been running)—“your uncle,
Doctor Harding, has himself sent his solicitor,
that I might look over the conveyance, the
settlements, and the other deeds. I know
all. Who'd have imagined that you, of all
men, concealed a romance at the bottom of
that strong heart? But all this is idle
speculation about characters; what fills my
mind now is, your good fortune. You
deserve it; you have patiently waited, faith-
ful to your young engagement; it is right

215
such patience should receive its reward. I
congratulate you."
Harding sprung to his feet, and, stamping
on the ground, exclaimed furiously.
“Explain yourself, or by the hour that
is passing over us, I shall do something
desperate.”
“ Then don't you know? What she and
all of them have been contriving an agree-
able surprise for you? And yet she insists
upon your being treated with such princely
confidence in the settlements ! Will allow
but forty to be put out at interest and tied
down upon herself, and insists that the re-
maining șixty thousand pounds shall be
handed over to you, freely, unconditionally,
without one reserve, without a single stipu-
lation of any kind whatever.”
“Of whom are you speaking ?” demanded
Cuthbert, in a whisper which Falconer heard
better and marked more than if it had been
a louder tone.


## p. 216 (#224) ############################################

HARDING
“Why, of whom but Miss Emily Whit-
sund, of course!” he replied. “ Coal and
iron have been found upon Christ's Hope
estate. You are rewarded for constancy and
faith, for honour, love, and patience.”
Cuthbert looked up to Heaven with an
indescribable expression of terror in his face.
Falconer had not seen anything like it in
that face before.
“Wait for me here,” said Cuthbert, “ till
I return. Will you ?”
“I will,” said Falconer.
“Word of honour ?" inquired Cuthbert.
“ Word of honour,” replied Falconer,
solemnly.
Harding then took a bundle of bank notes,
which he crammed into his pocket, went into
the hall, and, shutting the library door after
him upon Falconer, said to Saunders
“You have posted that letter, of course ? "
“ Certainly, sir,” replied Saunders,-fib-
bing; “I have posted it."


## p. 217 (#225) ############################################

THE MONEY-SPINNER.
217
Cuthbert looked at his watch as he put on
his hat, and pursued—
“At what post-office ?”
“At the usual one, sir,” replied Saunders
_“the nearest”—and he named it.
Cuthbert rushed forth.
Saunders, terrified by his master's manner,
waited only till he had turned the corner of
the street, and then slipped out and posted
the fatal letter in another post-office.
When Cuthbert reached that where he
supposed it was, he explained to the shop-
woman, a respectable stationer, that, within
the last five or seven minutes, a letter had
been dropped into her receiving box: he
would describe it before seeing it: he wanted
merely to rectify, in her presence, the
address.
The letter-carrier had only that moment
left her shop with his bag. Where, Harding
asked, could he overtake or find him ? It
was most important. The woman struck

by his visible anxiety, and suspecting no
wrong, answered to the best of her ability.
In less than three minutes, Harding had
found the letter carrier, bag in hand, hurry-
ing along the street.
Harding repeated his case, adding, that if
the man would permit him, in his presence,
to rectify the address, he would give him
twenty pounds.
“Come into this public house,” said Hard-
ing, “ we'll have a glass of porter in a private
room; stay, I will make it forty pounds"
(he produced two twenty pound notes, one
of which he thrust upon the man), “and
take half now, half in one moment, when
1 have scrawled a single word on the super-
scription of the letter.”
The bag was rifled and examined in the

letter was in it. Harding uttered a fierce
cry, and, throwing the other note to the
man, rushed home.

This time he learnt the truth from Saun-
ders, whom he caught by the throat, and
hurled with a giant's force right across his
hall, going forth again into the street him-
self, without one thought about Falconer.
He was scarcely outside his door, when he
met Mrs. Marlowe Harding and her niece,
Miss Emily Whitsund, whom he supposed
to have been in the country. Emily stretched
out her hand to him, and said they were
coming to him with pleasant news.
He took the dear hand, for ever lost, like
one in a trance ; said they would find his
mother; and sped away from them as a man
distraught or doomed.
Looking after him, till he had disappeared,
they ascended the steps of his house, re-
gretting that the doctor could not have
joined them, nor leave his rectory till
next day. They were shown by the scared
footman into the library, where they found
Mr. Falconer, who told them that he had

anticipated them; and that Cuthbert Hard-
ing already knew of Emily's altered fortune.
Meanwhile, Cuthbert first went to the
other post-office, and found that his letter
was now entirely beyond his reach. He then,
reflecting that Emily was in town, took the
night mail to Warwickshire ; and early next
morning, before any one else could come for
it, proceeded to the post-office where his
letter must be. He stated that he was
stopping at the rectory of Panes cum
Piscibus, and that, as he had some business
in Throstledale, Dr. Harding had requested
him to ask for any letters that might have
come addressed either to the doctor, or Miss
Emily Whitsund.
But who shall contend against Providence ?
Not in the end, not when the time is ripe,
he “who never has prayed.” Just while the
postmistress was busy sorting her little
packet, and just as she was saying,
“Yes, sir; there are three letters for the

doctor; and that is all; no-beg pardon,
sir, here is also one for Miss Whitsund.”
At this moment, a sonorous “hem !”
startled both her and Cuthbert, and they
looked round.
Dr. Marlowe Harding was himself in the
shop.
What could Cuthbert do?: I pass over
the exquisite little scene which followed,
when the doctor shook his nephew's hand,
congratulated him, and to the postmistress's
· scandal, asked him what on earth had
brought him to Throstledale ?
One chance more remained. The letter
was marked “private.” The doctor recog-
nized his nephew's handwriting ; said he
could not go to town that day—but would
forward the lover's fond letter.
“Well done, patience !” cried the doctor,
slapping his nephew on the shoulder; and
the nephew forthwith returned to town. It
was evening when he arrived.

He never put his head under a roof that
night. He perambulated the streets till grey
dawn; yes, till the nine o'clock post.
When the first post of the day arrived at
the hotel where Emily and her aunt were
lodging, Cuthbert stood in the doorway.
No letter for either Mrs. Harding or Miss
Whitsund.
With a low cry, Cuthbert was turning
away, when a railway cab, piled with
luggage, drove up, and Dr. Marlowe Hard-
ing descended.
Cuthbert paused spellbound. The doctor
caught sight of him.
“What I nephew,” whispered he, approach-
ing, “love vigils ; I'll be bound you were
here early, gazing at windows, and con-
jecturing which was hers. Never mind;
though you have not seen her yet to-day,
your letter shall stand you proxy at break-
fast, and shall converse for you with the
lady that you love. I have it here. I say
again, Well done, patience !"

The sleepless watcher turned away, never
destined to know again what quiet slumber
was, and reached his home ghastly and
fevered.
He found Falconer, who had never quitted
the house, stretched on a sofa in the library,
fast asleep.
“I congrat__” began poor Falconer,
rubbing his eyes, and sitting up.
“Falconer,” said Harding, in a hollow
voice, "you are under some monstrous
delusion. I shall never marry Miss Whit-
sund. But I shall have something for you
to do professionally concerning my early
and almost immediate marriage with Miss
Henrietta Mandeville.”
About a week had passed, and Cuthbert's
last plan had succeeded beyond his own
hopes, when Mr. Rosebriar was announced.
“I am uneasy about the turn this affair
seems to be taking,” said the visitor.
“So am I,” said Cuthbert.


## p. 224 (#232) ############################################

HARDING
“But my share in it,” said Rosebriar,
“was trust money, as I told you.”
Cuthbert shrugged his shoulders.
“And it was you, it was you who
persuaded me to venture it," urged Rosebriar.
Cuthbert shrugged his shoulders again.
“We must take the rough,” said he, “if
we take the smooth. The chances were
good.”
Mr. Rosebriar knew nothing of the
matrimonial project.
The day for the wedding was named. It
was to be a strictly private marriage. On
that day, Cuthbert Harding ascertained
about his and Mr. Rosebriar's recent venture,
enough to make him exclaim-
as 1
“Well, it is lucky that I shall have
Henrietta's fortune. That will tide me
through this ill starred and unaccountable
pressure.”
A few days before the marriage, certain
deeds had to be signed, and Cuthbert

received an invitation to meet Geoffrey and
“Henrietta's trustee” at Falconer's chambers.
"It is well there be more trustees than
one in the world,” muttered Cuthbert, as he
put his hat on in his hall, and sauntered
forth to keep this appointment,

“I MENTIONED to them,” Falconer had re-
marked, “ that I had apprised you of your
great luck, as I certainly considered it.”
“Mentioned this to whom ?” cried Cuth-
bert.
“To Miss Whitsund and Mrs. Harding,"
answered Falconer, innocently.
“Alas !” exclaimed Cuthbert. “There
is a league to confound, as well as to
destroy me !"
After a long silence, he begged Falconer's
forgiveness with a smile like a spasm.
As Cuthbert Harding proceeded to Lin-
coln's Inn, a few days afterwards, the words

of his uncle continued ringing in his ears
like a scoff, though, in all likelihood, not
spoken with that intent—“Well done,
patience ?"
Patience was, he felt, exactly the faculty
he wanted. Algernon Childering, notwith-
standing the effervescence of a vivid genius,
had it constitutionally. But Cuthbert felt
that, quite irrespectively of patience or im-
patience, Algernon would never, in his
circumstances, have lost Emily's immense
fortune; because Algernon would have re-
mained inflexibly true to Emily's compara-
tive poverty.
“I have lost the only love of my whole
existence,” thought poor Harding, “in order
to secure a fortune with a wife who can never
have my heart; and now it turns out that,
with the love, I was actually throwing away
more money than I threw it away for-
many times more. I was in a dreadful
position ; true. But by simply continuing

faithful to honour, to my own best affections,
and to a plain rule of duty, I should liter-
ally, it seems, have been consulting my
interests, and surmounting my difficulties
a thousand times more efficiently. Who
would have thought it? Had I disdained
this suggestion of a heartless cunning, it
might then, indeed, and with positive truth
have been at this moment said to me-
* Well done, patience. Yes, and well
done, honour; well done, courage; well
done, truth.'
“They tell us,” so ran the current of
sombre reflection, as he pursued his way
through Piccadilly, Leicester Square, and
Long Acre — “ that such awards happen
elsewhere ; I never knew that they were
at all likely to befall in this world! Woe
is me! I have not only thrown away love
for a much smaller fortune than I might
have enjoyed by holding love fast, but I
have damned myself in her estimation. She

knows that I was at the Throstledale post-
office, asking for, trying to intercept, that
very letter, which my uncle has since given
to her, and which she, and, of course, all
of them have since read. And she knows
that Falconer had just told me of the
marvellous change in her position, when
she met me rushing out of my own house.
Then, my strangely prolonged absence day
and night—my non-return! Then comes
the uncle, who the very next morning had
met me in Warwickshire—and how em-
ployed! Oh, derision ! Oh, ignominy! It
is all seen through like glass my base
surrender, my baser attempt to recall it-
my vain struggles in the net of my own
weaving! How I must be scorned ! How
Emily's lip curls at the thought of her old
playmate! How my uncle chuckles ! It
is as if fiends had juggled with, and were
now mocking poor Cuthbert Harding !”.
Again he thought that, in the crowded

streets, and in the open daylight, somebody
behind him, had laughed. He turned. No-
body answered to his idea.
“Since I helped Tom Falconer's love, in
money and in honour-since I hastened the
day of his honest wishes by my purse, and
stood between the peace of bis single heart,
and the attack of George Childering's in-
tended libertinism, at the risk of my life-
I have never once been haunted by that
old delusion, and does it now return ?”
With a sort of gloomy defiance, he stood
still under the little archway leading out of
Great Queen Street into Lincoln's Inn Fields,
and he listened. All was silent, save the
usual sounds of the never resting metro-
polis. Nothing seemed to mock at his last
strange question. With a sigh of relief, he
slowly resumed his way across Lincoln's Inn
Fields towards the imposing new hall.
“ To meet Henrietta's trustee !” mused
Harding; “her money is in the funds, I

always understood. So much the better.
Yet, if this ship had not vanished under the
curse which seems to shrivel up, of late,
whatever I touch, I should not need that
charming girl's fortune, to ransom the awful
parchment which lies somewhere hereabouts,
and which threatens me like a witness at
the judgment seat. And the day approaches !
It must be done. Anything but that one
exposure. I could not survive it a single
minute. A straw could strike me dead,
were it known. I, who have held my head
so high! no; I would fly rather to the
worst that is hidden beyond death, than
submit, were it but once, to look mankind
in the face, after this became known.”
He had here, and for the first time,
harboured so appalling and so accursed a
thought, that, with his old experience and
recollections, whether diseased or otherwise,
he stood still again and listened. Oh, he
was not in the least molested by any of

the sounds which he happened to hear.
Nevertheless, a curious little thing affected
him; if he did not hear a laugh, he im-
agined, as the memory of his conduct to-
wards Tom Falconer again fitted for a mere
instant through his mind, and that he heard
a sigh, soft, long, and melancholy. He
reasoned with himself, that it must have
been his own—and began to think that,
if his last speculation turned out badly,
some young girl, perhaps, like Henrietta,
would, through Mr. Rosebriar's villainy, be
rendered portionless.
“And how her husband will be taken
in, if he marries for the same motive as I
do !” thought Harding. “But the specu-
lation is not yet hopeless : and, if it do
fail, why, some day, when I have brought
my affairs round again, I will perhaps re-
place the money which Rosebriar's villainy,
has dissipated.”
At Falconer's chambers, Harding found

the master of that abode, one or two clerks,
and his old school friend, Geoffrey Mande-
ville. Sir Walter's presence was not neces-
sary, and he did not like the affair well
enough to come.
As Harding exchanged greetings with
Geoffrey, he thought to himself-
“Yes, it is all very well; but it was
almost the toss up whether we fought or
became brothers-in-law.”
Falconer explained that only the trustee
was now waited for; and Cuthbert was
soon engaged in a conversation about old
times with Geoffrey.
In the midst of it came a shuffling knock,
and presently an eager, hungry eye was
fluttering over every object in the chambers.
Cuthbert bounded from his chair-
“Why, Falconer,” he exclaimed, “you
don't mean that this man is Miss Henrietta
Mandeville's trustee ?”.
· Mr. Rosebriar, of an ashy paleness, and

trembling in every joint, looked fixedly at
Cuthbert, and, half in supplication, half in
menace, said
“You persuaded me! You !"
It will naturally be supposed that both
Falconer and Geoffrey were much astonished
at this unintelligible cross fire of ejaculations.
The two culprits stared ruin at each
other. Rosebriar dropped his eyes the first.
Not a syllable was offered by either of the
gentlemen in explanation. The day for the
wedding had been fixed, and was at hand;
no remedy remained, even were that day put
off-none, even were the marriage wholly
put off sine die. Cuthbert saw not how this
could at all mend his position now. Be-
sides, it was not yet sure that Henrietta's
fortune was quite lost.
Accordingly, the signing was regularly
gone through-Falconer stealing a timid
look at Cuthbert every now and then, while
Geoffrey could not take his eyes off Mr.

Rosebriar, who was hardly able to hold his
pen.
But we will spare the reader the details
of that scene. We must also omit the
equally striking scenes which preceded and
which attended the bridal of Cuthbert and
his wife, Henrietta Harding.
Enough that this event took place. The
strictest privacy marked all its particulars.
It was resolved that the bridegroom and
his bride should proceed to Paris for the
honeymoon, stopping a day, or what other
length of time pleased them, on the road,
at Cuthbert's town house in London.
Algernon was abroad—none but his father
knew where, and the father would not say.
It required something which should occupy
a greater space in the public journals than
Cuthbert's wedding, to let that gentleman
know that Emily was free.
The arrangement just alluded to delighted
Henrietta, and when Harding told her that

he expected very important news as they
passed through town, that he could not
go further without it, and that even their
ulterior movements might depend on what
he heard, she cheerfully acquiesced in the
proposed delay.
The fact was that, on the evening of
the wedding day, he reckoned on obtaining
certain and decisive knowledge of what fate
had attended Henrietta's fortune. On the
following day, he had agreed with the firm
who held the conveyance, that the deed was
either to be sent by them to York for regis-
tration, or to be ransomed by him, out of
their hands. Henrietta's fortune could have
ransomed it thrice over—Emily's, ten times.
Such was the posture of affairs, as the
bold and envied adventurer, the Member of
Parliament, the disposer of other people's
fates and fortunes—the “Money-spinner”
pronounced in the country church, on that
wedding morning, not far from the scenes

of his youthful hopes and dreams, the solemn
words which killed them all as they still
glowed feebly at the bottom of his secret
heart, words which raked away the last
smouldering embers of them for ever.
Returning to the park, to the wedding
breakfast, he did that which he had never
done in all his life before: he drank wine
till the blood, or the mind, or both, in their
mysterious union, sparkled in his brain like
the foam of the champagne.
From the table he went to the carriage.
Cuthbert gave Henrietta his arm to assist
her into her place. He then paused, lost
in thought, his face pale as alabaster, his
eyes glowing like carbuncles, and motioned
to Rosalie, Henrietta's maid, to go inside
and sit by her mistress.
“ Are you going outside ? " quoth Hen-
rietta.
“The places are taken in the train,” said
Cuthbert, “ for carriage and all; you will

not quit your present position till you reach
my house in London, for the horses will be
again harnessed at the terminus. As for
me, my dear Henrietta, there is a train
earlier by a few minutes than that in which
you will travel. I will be at home before
you to say welcome.”
As he spoke he motioned to the coachman,
and away sped the equipage. He, himself,
made a groom dismount; he kissed hands
to Henrietta, as he overtook and passed the
carriage, careering onwards with a speed
which it made her giddy to watch.
At Throstledale she saw him not. He
had gone on, said the station master, to
London.
At his fine house there, the hall door was
wide open; a train of servants lined the
way; Rosalie helped her young mistress
into it. The bridegroom was not there to
welcome the bride.
There was a note from him. He would

be at home in the evening. Oh! that borrid
business! She had hoped he would cease
" to be busy,” when she had granted him
her hand.
The news which he expected, he could
not bear to receive at home. He had gone
to meet it. Moreover, he had contrived
that all communications of any other nature
which might meanwhile arrive for him,
should forth with be brought to a certain
room in a certain hotel which overlooked
the length of one of the mightiest of earth's
thoroughfares, and he proceeded thither to
learn first the great intelligence.
He arrived, and alas ! soon knew the
result for which he had waited. His bride
had no longer a fortune. He sat long,
looking forth upon the great torrent of
human life and human passion which passed
on beneath the window; and he envied the
dying and the dead.
During the whole afternoon and evening,

Henrietta waited patiently at home for him,
in the drawing-room of the fine house. At
first she remained alone ; at length she sent
for Rosalie. It was dark, and he had not
yet returned. It was beneath her dignity
to question servants. In truth, when they
entered the apartment, on one pretext or
another, to steal a look at the beautiful
bride, she put on an air, as though all was
according to preconcerted arrangement. But
Rosalie had been the attendant of her child-
hood. She soon sent for this old attendant
to sit with her; and gave orders that they
were not to be disturbed, till the master of
the house himself returned.
Accordingly, Rosalie came, and sat with
her young mistress, far from the accustomed
haunts, in that large, fine, strange drawing-
room. At first Henrietta betrayed a little
absence of mind; then, by degrees, a little
petulance; then, slowly, a little alarm. But
a great fear came upon her at last; and
2

Rosalie could not reason that fear away.
Henrietta wept violently; wept in a passion
of terror.
There was a great dog of the Mount St.
Bernard kind in the drawing-room when she
first entered it; and the butler had apolo-
gized, saying, certainly that was not the
usual place for the animal. But Mr. Hard-
ing had given strict orders that the dog was
not to be allowed to follow him : and they
had kept him in the hall till they heard the
wedding-carriage stop at the door. Then
they had, in their hurry, shut the dog into
the drawing-room, lest he should break forth
as soon as the hall door was opened. They
would now take him down again. By no
means, said Henrietta. She made friends
with him ; and the dog expressed his appro-
bation of her kindness in short, glad, deep
monosyllables.
The dog lay down on the rug; and as
Henrietta and Rosalie conversed he began to
52

study them attentively, with very steadfast
eyes, from between his fore paws.
As evening advanced, however, he rose
from this place, went to the door, snuffed
under it, and lay down before it, at precisely
sufficient distance to allow it to open
inwards.
Henrietta having expressed some vague
misgivings which the lady's maid combated,
Henrietta declared that in Cuthbert Hard-
ing's face, as she had last beheld him, when
he was borne past the carriage, she had seen
something which she had never noticed
before ; it was something terrible, she said.
“La! ma’am,” replied Rosalie,“ how can
you go on so ? I am sure he looked quite
as he ought, only a little tired and fagged,
with a flush on the top of it.”
“He is uneasy,” said Henrietta. “What
can make him uneasy?”
“Fifty things,” returned the attendant ;
“perhaps it is some great money matter.”

"I wish I could think so !” cried Hen-
rietta, all radiant. She literally beamed
with some sudden idea.
“Well, it is nothing else, ma’am, depend
on it,” said Rosalie, who observed the favour-
able, the beneficial effect she had produced ;
“you know the name he goes by is the
. Money-spinner,' high and low—begging
your pardon, at the same time, ma'am, that
I should make so bold as to call my master
any name but his own. It was not me gave
it to him.”
“Ah!” said Henrietta, with a sigh,
“that is true; and I, doubtless, can do
nothing; what is anything I could do, in
such "
She did not finish the sentence; for
the dog had sprung up with a sudden
barking.
There had been no knock at the hall door.
Harding had let himself in with a private
key. A slow step approached; the drawing-

room door opened ; Henrietta flew into her
husband's arms. Dismissing Rosalie with a
gesture, she exclaimed-
“Cuthbert, you ought to ask my pardon.”
“I know it,” said he ; “I could not return
sooner."
“Oh, it is not for that,” she cried.
“Ah!” said he fearfully, “not for that?
Then-- But what do you mean ?”
“ You talked of sailing from England to-
day,” she said with an affectionate look.
“Oh!” replied he with some relief-
“true, I am not ready ; nor even to-morrow
morning. But, to-morrow night, perhaps.
Very possibly, to-morrow night.”
“You well know," said she, slily, “ that
it is not these miserable trifles for which you
should ask your Henrietta's pardon.”
He gazed at her in doubt, in fear, in con-
sciousness.
“For what, then?” asked he, after a
pause, in a peremptory tonc.

“Nay, if you frighten me,” replied she,
“I shall never tell you.”
“I ought to ask your pardon for wearing
my hat,” he said, taking it off, and fairly
sinking into a chair.
“ Cuthbert,” said she, solemnly, “ some
money matters annoy you.”
He started slightly—languidly; and looked
at her without speaking, for again he envied
the dying and the dead.
“How could you so misknow, miscompre-
hend Henrietta, your own Henrietta ?” She
pursued—“Have I not wealth? To me
what signify marriage settlements, while my
husband's soul is tormented with secret dis-
quietudes ? Do you doubt me, Cuthbert ?
Do you think I would refuse you my signa-
ture to anything which might extricate you
from trouble, from danger, from sadness ?
No doubt, Cuthbert,” she added, with a
heavenly smile of confiding love—“in the
great affairs of a man like you, a fortune

like mine can effect, perhaps, but little ; yet,
even a little, I mean comparatively, may be
of service; and you are welcome to it all.
I'll sign anything."
He covered his face with his hands.
“Nay, dearest,” said she, putting her light
hand upon his burning head; “it is nothing.
I am only too thankful if I can be of service
to chase away the cloud from your face.
My sole fear is that my fortune may not
suffice.”
Yes, yes ; her fortune would have sufficed
three times over, if he, when Mr, Rosebriar
had spoken of trust-money, had not sneered
and sophisticated the sacredness of it away.
Suppose he had only treated it as though it
had concerned himself, merely doing for
once as he would be done by? But, because
he did not see how it could effect his own
interests, self was now without its last
buckler. One thought of others then, and
he would now have been safe ; one thought

of justice, and his policy had carried him
through. Who could have supposed it ?
He would dispose of himself as he had pro-
posed. “Ha! ha! ha!” No wonder if he
dreamt that he was mocked at.
“Henrietta,” said he, "you are like an
angel, and I am like—what I may soon be.
But it is useless. I have returned to tell
you not to be alarmed if I do not return
home to-night.”
“I knew,” interrupted she, half screaming,
“that my fortune would not suffice. But
there is my brother Geoffrey. I tell you,
Cuthbert, he is generosity itself.”
“Peace, peace, my too noble friend,” cried
poor Harding. “Peace ! peace !” repeated
he, for whom there was peace no more.
She twined her hands together suppliantly
and, looking upwards, cried-
“ You little thought-you, the wealthy
man—that the girl Henrietta's fortune was
destined to save you. Oh, happy is the

opportunity! Slight the sacrifice ! Cuth-
bert, I, too, when I have heard of your
wealth, for which I never cared, little thought
what a strange and pleasing destiny was
reserved for us. You could not, with all
your cleverness, have procured me a more
exquisite enjoyment than this one reflection
—that we two meet, and oh! Cuthbert, that,
contrary to the world's idea, I find you poor,
and then I enrich you."
"Find you," echoed Cuthbert, with a
ghastly stare, and very slowly; “find you
poor, and enrich you—find you rich, and
ruin you—find-find-"
The haggard man dropped the broken
speech, and turned towards her with a wan
face, and a sweet, yet dreadful smile. He
tried to speak, but could not. She ex-
claimed

placed pride. Attempt no refusals. Defraud
me not of my gratification. Do you grudge

that Henrietta should owe so much to Cuth-
bert? Between you and me, you know, the
rule that holds good is not only different
from, but just precisely contrary to, that
which prevails, among people of business, and
in the cold, hard world. When a stranger
puts money into your hand, the debt is
yours; when Henrietta gives it to you, the
debt is Henrietta's. Were my fortune only
a thousand pounds, I should owe you but a
trifling enjoyment in bestowing it; there-
fore, being what it is, and disposed of as it
is, I pray you consider well what Henrietta,
at this moment, owes to Cuthbert !”.
“I am considering that very thing,”
replied he; and if the flaming sword of
justice had been passed through his guilty
soul, the wound could hardly have been more
deep than that which those words of all-
confiding love inflicted. “I am consider-
ing,” he again murmured, “what Henrietta
owes to Cuthbert.”

HARDING
By an almost superhuman effort, he braved
out that awful interview to a decent close ;
and confessing nothing, departed with an
injunction that, on no account, must she
allow herself to feel depressed, or even sur-
prised, if, on the evening of this their wed-
ding-day he found himself unable to return
home again. Some time next day she should
see him ; and meanwhile, she must have all
in readiness for their journey to the con-
tinent. He went, the dog following him
unregarded.
She retired to rest, alone, in the strange,
fine house.
How, or where Harding passed that night,
is not known. In the forenoon of the next
day, he visited the same hotel where that
room was reserved for his use, and asked if
there were any letters for him.
“Yes, sir," replied the waiter: “one
letter; I put it on the table in your room,
myself; and there is a gentleman, sir.”

Harding found Falconer waiting for him.
The letter lay on the table ; he knew the
handwriting. It was from the senior part-
ner in the firm who held the deed, which
was on that day, or never, to be ransomed.
Ten thousand pounds, at least, were neces-
sary for this ransom.
Opening the letter, with an excuse to
Falconer, Harding found that he had given
him till four p.m., to ransom the deed,
failing which it would, that evening, be
despatched to York, for registration. He
put the letter in his pocket, and looked
up.
“I hardly knew you,” said Falconer ;
“you cannot have slept— "
“What do you want with me?" inter-
rupted Harding. Falconer replied in alarm,
and confusedly-
“Why, Harding, you must pardon me.
But you once rendered me a great service
—and I am now a happy, married man,

ance-2”
“What do you want with me?” said
Harding.
Falconer resumed in increasing alarm-
“Where was I ? Oh! at perseverance—
well, the upshot of it is this, Harding : you
look to me, lately, as if something were
troubling you, and because you once helped
me, I am now ready to help you with a
small sum-it may be called the whole of
my savings, and you are quite welcome to
it-I mean, briefly, a thousand pounds, and
no thanks whatever."
Again, the smile, like a spasm, flitted
over Harding's face. Poor Falconer's mite !
What could it effect. This very day, ten
times the amount were needful to keep the
proud man out of the felon's dock. And
next month! To be sure, a little time was
a wonderful matter to a man of Harding's
resources; but what could the tenth part of

253
the requisite sum—for the very day now
passing—accomplish ?
"Can you spare me your time,” demanded
Harding, “ till four o'clock ?”
"I can and will,” returned Falconer.
“Come, then,” said Harding, who put on
his hat; and they left the room in silence.
The Mount St. Bernard dog followed, un-
regarded.
They reached the offices of the firm which
held the deed.
“I find,” said Harding, “ that, until
Tuesday next, I must leave this deed in
your hands."
“Then,” said the senior partner, “it must
go to York to-night.”
: “No,” said Harding, “ because, you see,
the whole world would then know that I had
borrowed money on a property which I had
only just bought.”
“That is not our affair,” replied the senior
partner, who could not know that, as he

spoke, and as Harding with a calm eye
listened to him, an icy coldness, like a
sword, passed through the listener's spine.
“But our understanding ? ” said Harding.
“Was for a fixed time; and the time is up,
and the gratuitous margin to that time is up
also," replied the senior partner, coldly
watching the Money-spinner.
“Next week,” said Harding, unmoved,
“I can dispose of three hundred thousand
pounds. To-day I have not your money,
without losing a hundredfold.”
“ That is unfortunate," observed the senior
partner with an increased coldness.
“ Nay, I will confess this much,” said
Harding, “ that I would even make you a
present of what cash I have to-day, as a
premium on your delay till Tuesday. Here
are a thousand pounds for you to wait till
Tuesday. Judge, then, whether it is not
important to me-whether my motive is.
frivolous "

He took out Falconer's money as he spoke.
The senior partner pronounced sentence of
death thus-
“Talk to me of anything but an affair
utterly worked out and done with. You
have till four o'clock.”
The Mount St. Bernard dog, which had
been very impatient during this conference,
here jumped upon Harding, placed his
weighty paws on Harding's chest; and
seeming to say, with his great eyes, “I am
not my master's judge."
The Money-spinner and Falconer with-
drew; Falconer waited for Harding to speak,
and Harding did not speak. At the same
time, he did not seem to know whither they
were to go next; and he did not go far.
Before he got to the end of Chancery Lane,
he turned and went back towards the
chambers of the firm ; he then halted, stood
looking on the ground, lost in thought, for
a moment; and, finally, resumed his pre-

vious direction. This maneuvre he repeated
three times.
At length he went into Fleet Street and
eastwards, Falconer not daring to break the
silence between them, or to interrupt Hard-
ing's thoughts. Into several offices, one
bank, and various places of business, Hard-
ing went alone, bidding Falconer wait for
him in the street. In most of these cases,
Falconer observed that Harding did not
enter beyond the vestibule, or outer waiting-
room, but came out again irresolute, and
went away. Once, or twice, at most, he
penetrated into the presence which sat
within.
Always on emerging, he walked very fast,
then half stopped, as though he had forgotten
something; but proceeded forward again im-
mediately. Falconer noticed, too, that his
pace was never the same for a minute at a
time. Occasionally, Falconer could not keep
up with him ; presently, he moved with the

257
utmost deliberation, stooping ; once or twice
he halted altogether, lost in thought.
Perhaps an hour or more had been thus
spent in silence, when they returned to
Chancery Lane. Harding now spent another
hour in going in and out of the office to
which he had paid his first visit; and always
with the same success. Nay, Falconer could
not help remarking that the more the senior
partner of the firm noticed Harding's anxiety
to prevent the deed from being sent that
day to York, the more he seemed resolute to
send it.
It was half-past two p.m., when Harding,
with an “as you please, then,” and a shrug
of the shoulders, quitted the office after the
last of these quickly iterated visits. He did
not go far. He turned into a neighbouring
tavern, and asked for a private room. The
room looked upon the street. Harding went -
to the window, and stood there for some
time; suddenly, he recoiled as if he had been
53

shot. Falconer, who (still respecting his
companion's silence) had also approached the
window, looked out. There was a stoppage
in the street. A lady in an open carriage
was just turning her glance away from the
window. Falconer fancied that he knew the
face. Harding knew it well. That face had
smiled joyously and gleefully upon him
many times in the play of childhood. It
was Emily's.
Harding, with a glance at his watch,
exclaimed that it was past three, and seized
his hat. Whither is he going, now? thought
Falconer. Again to the office, where he had
so often already been that day.
The senior partner was very civil ; but he
would not promise Harding to wait till
Tuesday, nor till Monday; and during their
conversation, a gentleman whom Harding
did not know was bustling about the apart-
ment, in a frock coat buttoned up to the
chin. As the clock struck four, this gentle-

259
man took his hat, and, with a “good-bye,”
walked briskly out. Harding loitered a few
minutes more ; and then saying “Come,” to
Falconer, departed. Returning to the tavern,
he said, after nearly an hour's reverie-
"Falconer, you have heard and seen all
that has passed. What think you? They
will grant so reasonable a request ?"
Falconer said nothing.
“ Do you think the deed will be sent ?”
repeated Harding.
“Nay,” said Falconer ; “I think it is
sent.”
On hearing this, Harding hurried back to
the office.
"It is gone, sir,” said the principal.
“ That gentleman who took his leave while
you were last here, is Mr. Castleton, the
junior partner of this firm. He is now on
his way to York. He has the deed on his
person.”
There are things which defy description ;

HARDING
and the Money-spinner's glance, when this
was said, is among them.
Once more, he returned to the private
room of the tavern ; and the first remark
which he made seemed to Falconer to be
strange, weak, and puerile in the extreme, if
not positively incongruous and unbecoming,
“What a strange noise, Falconer,” said
he, “the wind has been making all day !
Have you noticed how angry the voice of it
sounds? And every now and then great
sighs are borne past as if from distant ship-
wrecks out at sea.”
Harding sat down as he said this.
Falconer, who was still haunted by Cuth-
bert's face, such as he had for an instant
beheld it in the office of the firm, and to
whom that look was a sudden and dreadful
revelation of something hitherto unsuspected,
but now firmly, although most regretfully
believed, replied, with as much sternness as
was in his nature-

“The wind ! yes, a storm is coming ; the
wind has been on the increase since last
night. But what has that to do with the
business at stake ?”.
It had, however, some bearing upon it.
“ Truly, nothing,” answered Harding ;
"and now, I suppose, you will leave me?”
The dog, which had never quitted them,
here thrust his nose into Cuthbert's hand,
lifting it off the knee where it rested.
“If I can be of service,” replied Falconer,
“ friendship is more precious to me than
time.”
"Of service !" echoed Cuthbert. “ You
have often served me, Tom, and oftener still
desired to do so; but I shall never trouble
you again.”
“Never again! What does that mean?”
said Tom, into whose eyes the tears came.
He perceived, too, that Harding called him
by his Christian name, which he had never
done before.

Harding replied not, but gazed out of the
window on the leaden sky, from which there
poured a slant rain before a driving wind.
They were lighting the lamps in the streets.
As Falconer got no answer to his ques-
tion within any reasonable time, he put
down his hat, which he had taken up, and
began marching a little here and there
in the room. After a long silence, during
which Harding still gazed out of the window,
and Falconer thus fidgeted, the latter
stopped suddenly, and, hitting his right
hand into his left, cried out— '
“What does never again,' mean? Tell
me that?”
Harding said nothing.
“Well !” pursued Falconer—“well ? Eh ?
It is money, I know—and money be hanged.
But what of that ship ?"
Harding started.
“One would think,” said he, with a half
smile, “from your energy, that you had

caught sight of her. Alas! she was due
months since.”
“Well,” said Falconer, stoutly, “she'll
come yet.”
“There has been, for some time,” replied
Harding, shaking his head, “a strange
fatality upon all I attempt, and all that
concerns me. Come yet! Why, man, un-
less she were beating up the Thames, or,
rather, mooring off the wharf this very
hour, she would come too late, though she
brought all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind,
though deep in the water with Californian
or Australian gold, though crammed with
all the diamonds that ever issued from Gol-
conda. No, no! Too late, now, would be
the whims of fortune in her most bounteous
caprices—too late for me! I have been
fighting against a fatality-a fatality it is !”
“How do you know that ?” cried Fal-
coner, heroically. “How do you know that
it is not to try you, to humble you, and

then to save you, tried and humbled? Of
course, perdition there is in such cases, for
those who will not look at it in this light.
But if you do— ”
“Well, and if one does, what is there to
gain ?” said Harding.
“Three things,” replied Falconer (whose
words deserve to be written in gold): “first,
time ; secondly, one chance more ; thirdly,
that then the result, whatever it be, is none
of your own gratuitous hastening or making;
which last, when it happens, is beyond
human endurance. Remember that! It is
plain. The worst of it is, in these cases,
that after a man has long fought against
fortune, he gets discouraged, and begins to
fight, on fortune's side, against himself.
Thus, instead of prolonging the battle, he,
in the first place, loses it for certain, when
the loss of it was uncertain ; in the second
place, he loses it sooner; in the third place,
he loses it by his own act.”

In the whole course of his acquaintance
with Tom, Harding had never heard him
express himself with such startling clearness,
or such nervous energy and force; and,
accordingly, the appeal of his friend dis-
tracted him a moment from his gloom.
Tom proceeded-
“Have you thought of what ought to be
done immediately, supposing, just for amuse-
ment's sake, that you were not to lay down
your arms ?”
Harding stared in silence.
“Just on that supposition, you know,"
insisted Falconer.
“There would be,” replied Harding, with
a sickly smile, “a telegraphic message to
send, which should await Mr. Castleton's
arrival by the night train at York, and
which should wholly prohibit his acting till
receipt of another message.”
“Good,” replied Falconer. “I had not
thought of that. You see you have gained

more than twice as much as you asked for
in vain ; I mean, the day's delay. I suppose
you know how to manage the message ? ”
“It should come from the senior partner,”
replied Harding, with more life; “ or should
seem so to come.”
“Um!” said Tom, startled by the un-
scrupulous daring of the last words. “Well?
—and then ?”
Harding was plunged in study for a
minute. What a world, in that one minute,
the fleet mind traversed ! Two methods of
escape presented themselves ; both of them
feasible, if adopted, but neither of them to
be adopted. Geoffrey was generous : but
Harding could not survive the confession
which must precede any appeal to that
generosity. To prevent Geoffrey from
knowing the case— nay, even if Geoffrey
knew it (prevention hopeless)—Harding
would have blown his own brains out.
The other measure was still more efficient;

267
and it was still more out of the question, as
the reader will easily imagine. Suppose he
appealed to Emily, and told her everything ?
She would never more, indeed, esteem him;
but she would infallibly deliver him. Oh!
as to this, perdition itself seemed to his
pride and his rage to be preferable.
Hastily but plainly setting before his own
mind these two alternatives, he rejected
them in succession, with the most complete
repugnance and an irrevocable resolve. He
then looked about for any other resource-
any other means of deliverance—and found
none. Coming to this conclusion with the
utmost distinctness and self possession, he
said, sighing heavily-
“ There is no use in the telegraphic mes-
sage. Precisely the same situation of affairs
would return on Monday. I will not send
the message.”
“Ah !” cried Falconer, “ you hearken to
a bad adviser—to despair. I see it in your
face.”

“What could the delay do for me?” said
Harding.
At that very moment, a ship of which he
had given up all hope, was dropping anchor
in the Thames, and sending word of the fact
to the Money-spinner.
Falconer had no reply to the question.
After a pause, Harding resumed
“You asked me just now could you serve
me? Well, you can. Go home as fast as a
cab can take you ; keep the cab at your
door ; make your wife get into it as soon as
possible, and then drive straight with her to
my house, and cheer my wife—be com-
panions to her ; she will be surprised and
grieved, if not alarmed, at my not returning
to-night. Business makes it impossible that
I should. Tell her so—-"
“ Harding 1 Harding ?” interrupted Tom,
solemnly.
Cuthbert arose, took his hat, and said
with a ghastly smile-

“Do you remember that day at Eton
by the river ? That beautiful summer day,
when Geoffrey, you and I had the argu-
ment? Well, Tom, you had the best of
it, though I did not admit it at the time.
I allow it now, Tom. What a day was
that! It is different now. How it rains !
And hark ! you hear this wind still. Well,
good-bye, old comrade, good-bye. You'll
sometimes think of other times, and of—
of your friend. Much will be said, and
justly; yet, despite of this, you'll—you'll
-now and then keep a thought for Hard-
ing.”
" Where are you going to ?” cried Tom.
“It is time,” replied Harding. “It might
have been otherwise ; indeed, I had meant
it otherwise. But it is time now. Where
to ? Have you ever seen a run with the
buckhounds ? Whither goes the wounded
antler-bearer? whither at last? I am not
the same that I was, observe. I never had

the course I wanted. My uncle is a worthy
man—a worthy man. Tell him when you
meet him, that his nephew's thoughts ran
much upon him, lately—say lately. By-the-
by, you are drawing up deeds, or some-
thing, for Miss Whitsund, that was—that
is ! Ha! ha! ha! Good-bye, Falconer !
Good-bye, honest, dear Tom !”
And before Falconer could interpose he
had issued from the door, locking it on the
outside. The dog had broken nimbly out,
even before the master. As Harding passed
into the street, he called the waiter, and
told him that the gentleman upstairs wanted
him.
When Falconer was thus released, he
could find no trace of Harding. Reflecting
on the conversation which had just passed
between them, he exclaimed-
“That powerful mind has gone at last ;
that strong brain has given way.”
Thus thinking, he hurried home; and,

taking his wife, as Harding had begged,
drove with her to visit Henrietta. They
found the fine house in commotion. A
pressing telegraphic message had arrived
for Harding, early in the day, from South-
ampton; and almost immediately before
Falconer's appearance, a man of business
from the City, whom Cuthbert often had
employed, had come in the utmost eagerness
to see him. In his absence, the visitor had,
at last, demanded to speak with Mrs. Hard-
ing. Where was her husband ? She could
not say. But what was the matter ?
Matter ? Why a ship of his, long sup-
posed to be lost, had just cast anchor in
the river ; her success had been beyond
calculation-it was measureless—to Harding
she brought, not one, but many fortunes.
So enormous a stroke of luck had not hap-
pened in the memory of man.
Messengers were despatched in all direc-
tions for Harding; and Falconer, as the

last who had seen him, was closely cross-
examined by Henrietta. Presentiment
quickened her love into divination ; and
when Tom reported to her the words—
“Whither goes the wounded antler-bearer?”
she exclaimed-
“He alluded to a poem we have often
read together. He is gone home, he is gone
to-- Heavens ! we shall be late! To
the railway !—to the railway !”
At the station they found the trail, as
would be said in Indian hunting.
“A gentleman taking a ticket for Thros-
tledale, ma’am,” said the railway clerk,
whom Henrietta addressed. “Yes—by the
half-past seven train, there was such a
ticket—a dark gentleman, ma'am. Had he
a large dog, ma'am ?”
Cuthbert Harding had several adventures
in his journey to Warwickshire, and after-

wards. Henrietta, Rosalie, and Mrs. Fal-
coner, with her husband, the excellent Tom,
had also some adventures in their own pas-
sage over the same road, two hours later.
The flight and the pursuit had their vicissi-
tudes of better and worse chances—of hopes
rising and hopes sinking—of various pas-
sions undergoing rapid alternations.
With these three several subjects we
have no time to do more than just to make
this allusion to them.
On Heron Moss, under the grey crape
of the mist, and a thin penetrating rain,
as the night was about to struggle into the
dim morning of the Christian Sabbath, sat
the Money-spinner-alone in the world-
alone, at least, for human fellowship. His
dog was his sole companion. Harding had
wandered forth from Lea Meadows (where
none of his family then resided), after a
slight and hasty meal, which old Humphrey

served. Seeking the loneliest places, he
had, at length, reached Heron Moss; and
there, overwhelmed with fatigue of mind
and body, he threw himself on the damp
ground, and took out the phial, which had
long been his secret companion. The dog,
thrusting his nose into the master's hand,
displaced what it held, and a smaller cir-
cumstance than this has sufficed, ere now, to
turn aside a purpose of which Nature has
so just a horror. But Harding's was now
too obstinately fixed. Meantime, he had
been unintermittently pursued by his friend,
Falconer, who had persuaded Henrietta to
await at Lea Meadows the result of his
search. He found Harding alive-an-
nounced the arrival of the ship, and asked
him whether he was not right in counselling
him not to despair ?
“But the deed which has gone to York ?”
said Harding, faintly.
“I have sent a telegraphic message,”

returned Falconer, “which will stay every-
thing. You have still time.”
Harding tried to rise, but in vain.
“ Well done, patience—well done, faith !”
were the only words which Falconer could
catch.
In a very short time, the younger Mr.
Childering learnt that the promise into
which he had been surprised no longer
fettered him : Emily Whitsund became his
wife.
