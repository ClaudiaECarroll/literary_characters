INTRODUCTION
THOMAS HUGHES was born on October 20th, 1822, at
Uffington, a Berkshire village at the foot of White Horse
Hill. He was named after his grandfather, who served
as principal chaplain to George III. and George IV.,
became a Canon of St. Paul's, and married Miss Watts,
the daughter of the Vicar of Uffington, whom he suc-
ceeded as vicar. Their only child, John, was educated
at Westminster School and Oriel, Oxford, where he was
a year or two junior to Dr. Arnold. John Hughes was
a man of considerable culture—a good Latin scholar, a
poet in a small way, and an artist of some skill. His
mother was a very old friend of Sir Walter Scott, who
paid her son a pretty compliment, and gave him a free
advertisement to boot, in the Introduction to Quentin
Durward.1 John Hughes married Miss Wilkinson, a
Yorkshire lady, in 1820. Their eldest son, George
Edward, was born in 1821, and Thomas in 1822, in which
year the Itinerary was published.
Both boys were sent in 1830 to a private school near
1 Q. D. Ist edn. 1823, vol. i. p. xli. : I informed my friend
that I had just received from England a journal of a tour made in
the South of France by a young Oxonian friend of mine-a poet,
a draughtsman, and a scholar-in which he gives such an animated
and interesting description of the Chateau Grignan, the dwelling of
Madame de Sevigné's beloved daughter, and frequently the place of
her own residence, that no one who ever read the book would be
within forty miles of the same, without going a pilgrimage to the
spot. The Marquis smiled, seemed very much pleased, and ...
(wrote) down to my dictation, “An Itinerary of Provence and the
Rhone, made during the year 1819; by John Hughes, A.M., of Oriel
College, Oxford.”

INTRODUCTION
games dee and both were much
Winchester. Here athletics were much more regarded
than was usual, and both brothers had their natural
love of games deepened. As their father thought highly
of his college friend, Dr. Arnold, he sent them in 1834 to
Rugby. Tom was then nearly twelve. His life at school
was probably much like that of Tom Brown in the story;
he was not a great scholar, but always a good fellow and
a good sportsman. Respect for his headmaster deepened
before he left into a strong affection, and the tribute he
pays in the final chapters of this book to Dr. Arnold's
work and influence deserves to rank beside Matthew
Arnold's poem Rugby Chapel and the best passages in
Stanley's Life of Arnold.
In 1841, his last year at school, he played for Rugby v.
M.C.C. at Lord's, and went up to Oxford early in 1842
with sufficient reputation as a cricketer to be played for
Oxford v. Cambridge at Lord's in June the same year.
(He made 0 and 15 not out; Cambridge won by 162
runs.)
George and Thomas Hughes were both at Oriel, on
the same staircase. The Rugby boys of Arnold's time
were less frivolous than their contemporaries, and rather
held aloof from others; thus the brothers found their
associates mainly among Rugbeians—Matthew Arnold
and A. H. Clough, the poets, for instance. Thomas's
career at Oxford was not particularly distinguished, and
his strongest friendships were made after he left the
University. In 1844 he travelled with a pupil, the son
of a Berkshire neighbour, into the North of England and
Scotland. They mixed with all classes of men at hotels
and elsewhere, and the discussions they constantly heard
upon the burning question of the day, the Repeal of the
Corn Laws, greatly impressed him. He was essentially
“one who loved his fellow-men,” and, although his strong
and simple faith had weathered the religious storm then
raging in Oxford, he was not proof against the appeal
to his humanity made by his study of the Corn Law

question. He went north an old-fashioned Tory; he
returned an ardent Free Trader and something of a
Radical. In his own words, “I was rapidly falling away
from the political faith in which we had been brought up.
The noble side of democracy was carrying me away.”
The generous instincts thus aroused never deserted him.
In 1845 our author took his degree, and entered
Lincoln's Inn to read for the Bar. Here the second and
greatest influence upon his life came into play. Frederick
Denison Maurice was then Chaplain of Lincoln's Inn-
a Christlike man whose heart ached at the sight of the
grey lives of the working classes in London. Thomas
Hughes found in the teachings of Maurice, both religious
and social—if, indeed, these can be separated—complete
satisfaction, and he speedily yielded himself to their
spell. In this he was not alone, and the small band who
thought with Maurice began the “ Christian Socialist "
movement. Besides Hughes, the group contained C. B.
Mansfield, the brilliant chemist, who, by extracting
benzol from coal-tar, laid the foundation for the wonderful
aniline industry, was a pioneer in Aerial Navigation,
and died at thirty-six, a martyr to science; J. M. Ludlow,
a worker for the repeal of the Corn Laws, for the abolition
of slavery and for the better government of India, who
gave ungrudging help and advice to countless working
men's associations after his appointment as Registrar of
Friendly Societies ; Charles Kingsley, author of Alton
Locke, Westward Ho! and other works, who wrote for
the brotherhood under the name of Parson Lot; and
E. V. Neale, who spent his fortune and his life in working
out his belief in the Co-operative movement. The
historian Froude and A. P. Stanley were interested
spectators of Christian Socialism, but remained outside it.
From the outset the Christian Socialists put their
ideas into practice. They started classes for working
men, with themselves and their friends as teachers ;
finding their efforts successful, they founded in 1854 the

INTRODUCTION
Working Men's College, of which Thomas Hughes, who
proposed the resolution establishing it, became a teacher,
commanded the Volunteer Corps and was afterwards
Principal. Between 1854 and 1860 the college staff of
teachers included Edward Bowen, the great lawyer ;
Ford Madox Brown, the painter; J. Llewelyn Davies,
the translator of Plato; Mountstuart Grant Duff, poli-
tician and diarist; F. J. Furnival, Early English scholar;
Frederic Harrison, historian and philosopher, who still
delights us, whether “ among my books ” or pleading for
pure sport; Thomas Hughes ; Charles Kingsley ; J. M.
Ludlow; Godfrey Lushington; F. D. Maurice; E. V.
Neale; Dante G. Rossetti, poet and painter; John
Ruskin, art critic and economist; and Thomas Woolner,
the sculptor. Lucky “ working-men !” was there ever
such a constellation in the educational firmament ?
Besides experimenting in education, the Christian
Socialists advocated co-operative production; that is
to say, the formation of societies of work people who
should manage their own workshops and receive the
profits of their industry. These societies they helped
financially, and, it is to be feared, were sometimes victi-
mised. Thomas Hughes used to describe with much
gusto the amusement of their fashionable friends when
they appeared in suits of clothes made by a co-operative
tailors' society which they founded. Several who joined
the movement left it in disgust at the repeated failures,
but “ Tom Brown” never lost heart. To the end of his
life he believed in and advocated co-operative production,
co-partnership of masters and men in manufactures and
agriculture, and the establishment of people's banks.
The ordinary kind of co-operative stores he strongly
opposed unless they shared their profits liberally with
their employees.
Thomas Hughes was called to the Bar in 1848, and the
same year married Miss Frances Ford, the daughter of
a clergyman. His closest friends were Kingsley, then

a country vicar, and Ludlow, who shared legal chambers
with him. In 1853 he and Ludlow tried the communistic
experiment of a joint house. The experiment was, he
tells us, successful during the four years it lasted. In
this house, at Wimbledon, to the south-west of London,
Tom Brown's School Days was written. The manuscript.
was first shown to Ludlow, and greatly surprised him ; he
had not expected anything so original, or of such excellent
quality, from his friend. Its completion was delayed by
the death of the author's eldest daughter, but when
published anonymously in April 1857, it was a great
success, and passed through five editions in nine months.
The writer of a successful book is, naturally, en-
couraged to go on writing. The second part of “ Tom
Brown ”—Tom Brown at Oxford—was dedicated to
Maurice. It was not so successful as the first, partly
because it is not so good, and partly because ideals and
practices go out of date much more quickly at the Uni-
versity than with schoolboys, who are the most conserva-
tive creatures on earth. And there was no heroic figure,
like Dr. Arnold, permeating the whole. Hughes wrote
also The Scouring of the White Horse—a delightful descrip-
tion of his home surroundings in Berkshire—and several
memoirs, including the Memorial of a Brother, the defence
of Kingsley which forms the introduction to Alton
Locke, and a Life of Bishop Fraser.
The active share taken by Thomas Hughes in social
work led to his entering the House of Commons, where
he sat from 1865 to 1874. His principal achievement
was the Trades Union Bill of 1869. He worked steadily
at his profession of the law, becoming Q.C. in 1869, and
continued his connection with the co-operative movement,
presiding at the opening session of the first co-operative
congress in the same year. He was ever ready to speak
or give legal advice to young societies; though he was no
orator, his speeches were always weighty. In middle life
he lost a great deal of money in an attempt to found a

INTRODUCTION
co-operative settlement at Rugby, Tennessee, U.S.A., in
which he was the victim of misrepresentation. But he
remained optimistic and cheerful, and his last years were
rendered happy by his appointment in 1882 as County
Court Judge for Cheshire, where he was among friends,
and close to Manchester, the heart of the co-operative
world. The last time I saw him was at Oldham Parish
Church in 1885, when Fraser, Bishop of Manchester, a
warm friend of the working classes, preached the sermon,
and in the same pew sat Thomas Hughes, J. M. Ludlow,
and E. Vansittart Neale, three of the original Christian
Socialists of 1848. He died in 1896.
In middle age Tom Hughes was a tall, spare, athletic-
looking man, blue-eyed and fair-haired. His keen glance
and aquiline face gave the appearance of restless activity
and a quick temper, but this was corrected by his genial
speech and general air of benevolence. “Jehu Junior "
in Vanity Fair, which published a cartoon of him in 1872,
writes of him that “he retains all the generous obstre-
perous qualities of early youth” at the age of forty-nine ;
that “he is very like his book; he glories in being an
Englishman, and in exemplifying the ordinary English
qualities. He is always honourable, always benevolent,"
and so on.
Two questions suggest themselves for answer. Why
was Tom Brown's School Days written? The author
has told us plainly, in answer to a friend who thought
that he “preached” too much, that “my whole object
in writing at all was to get the chance of preaching. When
a man comes to my time of life and has his bread to make,
and very little time to spare, is it likely that he will spend
1 “ Hughes was one of the few prominent Englishmen of good
position who boldly and steadfastly championed the cause of the
North and of the Union during the American Civil War. He
received a splendid welconie in the Northern States when he visited
America in 1870, and I am satisfied that his influence had a great
deal to do in maintaining peace between his own country and the
American Republic at a most critical time."
Justin McCarthy: Reminiscences, vol. ii, p. 257.

almost the whole of his yearly vacation in writing a story
just to amuse people? I think not. . . . The fact is, the
sight of sons, nephews and godsons ... makes one ask
one's self whether there isn't something one would like
to say to them before they take their first plunge into the
stream of life, away from their own homes, or while they
are yet shivering after the first plunge. My sole object
in writing was to preach to boys.” And, in addition,
there can be no doubt that he was moved to add his
testimony to the character and work of his old headmaster,
who “ taught us that life is a whole, made up of actions
and thoughts and longings, great and small, noble and
ignoble; therefore the only true wisdom for boy or man
is to bring the whole life into obedience to Him whose
world we live in.”
Secondly, was Tom Brown the author himself ? In
the preface to Tom Brown at Oxford he denies in very
plain language any such identification : “he is not I,
either as boy or man-in fact, not to beat about the bush,
is a much braver, and nobler, and purer fellow than I
ever was.” This we must accept; but the fact remains
that Tom Brown and Tom Hughes had many features
in common, so many that those who knew him best found
the closest likeness. It was not for nothing that he was
“ Tom ” Hughes to all, gentle or simple, who knew him
for a good sportsman, a buttress of the weak against
oppression, and a hard hitter who took his share of blows
in the battle of life from bigger antagonists, without
blenching.
Unlike most of the other books in this series, Tom
Brown's School Days cannot claim great literary merit
as one of the reasons for its popularity and permanence.
It is first and foremost a boy's book, which has never
lost its hold upon British youngsters the world over, and
probably never will lose it, however sophisticated the
schoolboy may become. But it has been read with delight
by girls, and by adults of both sexes and all ages. A

INTRODUCTION
work which makes so wide an appeal must have qualities
even more valuable than literary style and correct English,
and in Tom Brown's School Days it is the simplicity and
honesty of purpose of the author, as revealed in his
characters—the feeling that the book is written by an
English gentleman in esse about English gentlemen in
the making, which reacts on the national pride in the
heart of the reader, and appeals irresistibly to his good-
will. Every school tale that is written perforce challenges
comparison with Tom Brown, and however great the
reputation and artistry of the authors, few of its imitators
come well out of the contest. The boys in Stalky & Co.
do not compare favourably with Tom Brown and his
friends; the worldly wisdom of Bates, brave man as he
is, is a poor exchange for the greatness of Arnold ; and
the grown-up Stalkies are not to be spoken of alongside
the godfearing Rugbeians of the Crimea and Mutiny.
Those who are old enough may cast their minds back
and recall many tales of schoolboy life; they will probably
agree that the first of the series was the best, and that in
1913, as in 1857, Tom Brown's School Days holds the field.
Rugby School did well to place Brock's statue of him
in front of the new buildings in the Barby Road; the
English co-operators did well to endow a Hughes Scholar-
ship at Oxford for the sons of working men ; but Thomas
Hughes's best memorial is to be found in the lives of the
boys and Old Boys of all ages, whether Corinthians or
outer barbarians, Rugbeians or “ louts," who have not
forgotten his teaching :-“NEVER FEAR. YOU TELL THE
TRUTH, KEEP A BRAVE AND KIND HEART, AND NEVER
LISTEN TO OR SAY ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
"YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER HEAR.”
And so to the story.

· TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
CHAPTER I
THE STAGE COACH
“Now, sir, time to get up, if you please. Tally-ho
coach for Leicester 'll be round in half an hour, and
don't wait for nobody.” So spake the Boots of the
Peacock Inn, Islington, at half-past two o'clock on
the morning of a day in the early part of November,
183—, giving Tom at the same time a shake by the
shoulder, and then putting down a candle and carrying
off his shoes to clean.
Tom and his father had arrived in town from
Berkshire the day before, and finding, on inquiry,
that the Birmingham coaches which ran from the city
did not pass through Rugby, but deposited their
passengers at Dunchurch, a village three miles distant
on the main road, where said passengers had to wait
for the Oxford and Leicester coach in the evening, or
to take a postchaise—had resolved that Tom should
travel down by the Tally-ho, which diverged from the
main road and passed through Rugby itself. And as
the Tally-ho was an early coach, they had driven out
to the Peacock to be on the road.
Tom had never been in London, and would have
liked to have stopped at the Belle Sauvage, where
they had been put down by the Star, just at dusk,
that he might have gone roving about those endless,

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
mysterious, gaslit streets, which, with their glare and
hum and moving crowds, excited him so that he
couldn't talk even. But as soon as he found that the
Peacock arrangement would get him to Rugby by
twelve o'clock in the day, whereas otherwise he
wouldn't be there till the evening, all other plans
melted away ; his one absorbing aim being to become
a public schoolboy as fast as possible, and six hours
sooner or later seeming to him of the most alarming
importance.
Tom and his father had alighted at the Peacock,
at about seven in the evening; and having heard with
unfeigned joy the paternal order at the bar, of steaks
and oyster-sauce for supper in half an hour, and seen
his father seated cozily by the bright fire in the coffee-
room, with the paper in his hand-Tom had run out
to see about him, had wondered at all the vehicles
passing and repassing, and had fraternized with the
boots and ostler, from whom he ascertained that the
Tally-ho was a tip-top goer, ten miles an hour in-
cluding stoppages, and so punctual that all the road
set their clocks by her.
Then being summoned to supper, he had regaled
himself in one of the bright little boxes of the Peacock
coffee-room, on the beef-steak and unlimited oyster-
sauce, and brown stout (tasted then for the first time-
a day to be marked for ever by Tom with a white
stone); had at first attended to the excellent advice
which his father was bestowing on him from over his
glass of steaming brandy and water, and then begun
nodding, from the united effects of the stout, the fire,
and the lecture. Till the squire, observing Tom's
state, and remembering that it was nearly nine o'clock,
and that the Tally-ho left at three, sent the little fellow
off to the chambermaid, with a shake of the hand

(Tom having stipulated in the morning before starting
that kissing should now cease between them), and a
few parting words.
“And now, Tom, my boy,” said the Squire,
“ remember you are going, at your own earnest
request, to be chucked into this great school, like a
young bear with all your troubles before you-earlier
than we should have sent you perhaps. If schools
are what they were in my time, you'll see a great
many cruel blackguard things done, and hear a deal
of foul bad talk. But never fear. You tell the
truth, keep a brave and kind heart, and never listen
to or say anything you wouldn't have your mother
and sister hear, and you'll never feel ashamed to come
home, or we to see you.”
· The allusion to his mother made Tom feel rather
chokey, and he would have liked to have hugged his
father well, if it hadn't been for the recent stipulation.
As it was, he only squeezed his father's hand, and
looked bravely up and said, “ I'll try, father.”
“I know you will, my boy. Is your money all
safe ? "
“ Yes," said Tom, diving into one pocket, to make
sure.
“ And your keys ? " said the Squire.
“ All right," said Tom, diving into the other
pocket. :
“Well then, good-night. God bless you! I'll
tell Boots to call you, and be up to see you off.”
· Tom was carried off by the chambermaid in a
brown study, from which he was roused in a clean
little attic, by that buxom person calling him a little
darling, and kissing him as she left the room; which
indignity he was too much surprised to resent. And
still thinking of his father's last words, and the look

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
with which they were spoken, he knelt down and
prayed, that come what might, he might never bring
shame or sorrow on the dear folk at home.
Indeed, the Squire's last words deserved to have
their effect, for they had been the result of much
anxious thought. All the way up to London he had
pondered what he should say to Tom by way of
parting advice; something that the boy could keep
in his head ready for use.
To condense the Squire's meditation, it was some-
what as follows: “I won't tell him to read his Bible,
and love and serve God; if he don't do that for his
mother's sake and teaching, he won't for mine. Shall
I go into the sort of temptations he'll meet with ?
No, I can't do that. Never do for an old fellow to go
into such things with a boy. He won't understand
me. Do him more harm than good, ten to one.
Shall I tell him to mind his work, and say he's sent to
school to make himself a good scholar ? Well, but
he isn't sent to school for that—at any rate, not for
that mainly. What is he sent to school for? Well,
partly because he wanted so to go. If he'll only turn
out a brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a
gentleman, and a Christian, that's all I want,” thought
the Squire; and upon this view of the case framed his
last words of advice to Tom, which were well enough
suited to his purpose.
For they were Tom's first thoughts as he tumbled
out of bed at the summons of Boots, and proceeded
rapidly to wash and dress himself. At ten minutes to
three he was down in the coffee-room in his stockings,
carrying his hat-box, coat, and comforter in his hand ;
and there he found his father nursing a bright fire,
and a cup of hot coffee and a hard biscuit on the table.
“Now then, Tom, give us your things here, and

THE STAGE COACH
drink this, there's nothing like starting warm, old
fellow.”
Tom addressed himself to the coffee, and prattled
away while he worked himself into his shoes and his
great-coat, well warmed through ; a Petersham coat
with velvet collar, made tight after the abominable
fashion of those days. And just as he is swallowing
his last mouthful, winding his comforter round his
throat, and tucking the ends into the breast of his
coat, the horn sounds, Boots looks in and says,
“ Tally-ho, sir ” ; and they hear the ring and the rattle
of the four fast trotters and the town-made drag, as it
dashes up to the Peacock.
“ Anything for us, Bob ? ” says the burly guard,
dropping down from behind, and slapping himself
across the chest.
“Young genl'm'n, Rugby; three parcels, Leicester;
hamper o'game, Rugby," answers ostler.
“Tell young gent to look alive," says guard,
opening the hind-boot and shooting in the parcels
after examining them by the lamps. “Here, shove
the portmanteau up a-top—I'll fasten him presently.
Now then, sir, jump up behind.”
“Good-bye, father—my love at home.” A last
shake of the hand. Up goes Tom, the guard catching
his hat-box and holding on with one hand, while with
the other he claps the horn to his mouth. Toot, toot,
toot! the ostlers let go their heads, the four bays
plunge at the collar, and away goes the Tally-ho into
the darkness, forty-five seconds from the time they
pulled up; Ostler, Boots, and the Squire stand looking
after them under the Peacock lamp.
“Sharp work !” says the Squire, and goes in again
to his bed, the coach being well out of sight and
hearing.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Tom stands up on the coach and looks back at his
father's figure as long as he can see it, and then the
guard having disposed of his luggage comes to an
anchor, and finishes his buttonings and other prepara-
tions for facing the three hours before dawn; no joke
for those who minded cold, on a fast coach in
November, in the reign of his late majesty.
And now the dawn breaks at the end of the fourth
stage, and the coach pulls up at a little road-side inn
with huge stables behind. There is a bright fire
gleaming through the red curtains of the bar-window,
and the door is open. The coachman catches his whip
into a double thong, and throws it to the ostler ; the
steam of the horses rises straight up into the air. He
has put them along over the last two miles, and is two
minutes before his time; he rolls down from the box
and into the inn. The guard rolls off behind. “Now,
sir,” says he to Tom,“ you just jump down, and I'll
give you a drop of something to keep the cold out.”
Tom finds a difficulty in jumping, or indeed in
finding the top of the wheel with his feet, which may
be in the next world for all he feels ; so the guard
picks him off the coach-top, and sets him on his legs,
and they stump off into the bar, and join the coach-
man and the other outside passengers.
Here a fresh-looking barmaid serves them each
with a glass of early purl as they stand before the
fire, coachman and guard exchanging business
remarks. The purl warms the cockles of Tom's
heart, and makes him cough.
“Rare tackle that, sir, of a cold morning,” says
the coachman, smiling; “ Time's up.” They are
out again and up; coachee the last, gathering the
reins into his hands and talking to Jem the ostler
about the mare's shoulder, and then swinging himself

up on to the box—the horses dashing off in a canter
before he falls into his seat. Toot-toot-tootle-too
goes the horn, and away they are again, five-and-
thirty miles on their road (nearly half-way to Rugby,
thinks Tom), and the prospect of breakfast at the end
of the stage.
And now they begin to see, and the early life of the
country-side comes out; a market cart or two, men
in smock-frocks going to their work pipe in mouth,
a whiff of which is no bad smell this bright morning.
The sun gets up, and the mist shines like silver gauze.
They pass the hounds jogging along to a distant meet,
at the heels of the huntsman's hack, whose face is
about the colour of the tails of his old pink, as he
exchanges greetings with coachman and guard. Now
they pull up at a lodge, and take on board a well
muffled-up sportsman, with his gun-case and carpet-
bag. An early up-coach meets them, and the coach-
men gather up their horses, and pass one another
with the accustomed lift of the elbow, each team
doing eleven miles an hour, with a mile to spare behind
if necessary. And here comes breakfast.
“Twenty minutes here, gentlemen," says the
coachman, as they pull up at half-past seven at the
inn-door.
Have we not endured nobly this morning, and is
not this a worthy reward for much endurance ?
There is the low dark wainscoted room hung with
sporting prints; the hat-stand (with a whip or two
standing up in it belonging to bagmen who are still
snug in bed), by the door ; the blazing fire, with the
quaint old glass over the mantelpiece, in which is
stuck a large card with the list of the meets for the
week of the country hounds. The table covered with
the whitest of cloths and of china, and bearing a

pigeon-pie, ham, round of cold boiled beef cut from a
mammoth ox, and the great loaf of household bread
on a wooden trencher. And here comes in the stout
head waiter, puffing under a tray of hot viands;
kidneys and a steak, transparent rashers and poached
eggs, buttered toast and muffins, coffee and tea, all
smoking hot. The table can never hold it all; the
cold meats are removed to the sideboard, they were
only put on for show and to give us an appetite.
And now fall on, gentlemen all. It is a well-known
sporting-house, and the breakfasts are famous. Two
or three men in pink, on their way to the meet, drop
in, and are very jovial and sharp-set, as indeed we
all are.
“ Tea or coffee, sir ?” says head waiter, coming
round to Tom.
“ Coffee, please,” says Tom, with his mouth full of
muffin and kidney ; coffee is a treat to him, tea is not.
Our coachman, I perceive, who breakfasts with us,
is a cold-beef man. He also eschews hot potations,
and addicts himself to a tankard of ale, which is
brought him by the barmaid. Sportsman looks on
approvingly, and orders a ditto for himself.
Tom has eaten kidney and pigeon pie, and imbibed
coffee, till his little skin is as tight as a drum; and
then has the further pleasure of paying head waiter
out of his own purse, in a dignified manner, and walks
out before the inn-door to see the horses put to.
This is done leisurely and in a highly-finished manner
by the ostlers, as if they enjoyed the not being hurried.
Coachman comes out with his way-bill, and puffing
a fat cigar which the sportsman has given him.
Guard emerges from the tap, where he prefers break-
fasting, licking round a tough-looking doubtful
cheroot, which you might tie round your finger, and

three whiffs of which would knock any one else out
of time.
The pinks stand about the inn-door lighting cigars
and waiting to see us start, while their hacks are led
up and down the market-place on which the inn looks.
They all know our sportsman, and we feel a reflected
credit when we see him chatting and laughing with
them.
“ Now, sir, please,” says the coachman; all the
rest of the passengers are up; the guard is locking the
hind boot.
“A good run to you !" says the sportsman to the
pinks, and is by the coachman's side in no time.
“Let 'em go, Dick !” The ostlers fly back,
drawing off the cloths from their glossy loins, and
away we go through the market-place and down the
High Street, looking in at the first-floor windows,
and seeing several worthy burgesses shaving thereat ;
while all the shopboys who are cleaning the windows,
and housemaids who are doing the steps, stop and look
pleased as we rattle past, as if we were a part of their
legitimate morning's amusement. We clear the town,
ånd are well out between the hedgerows again as the
town clock strikes eight.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
of its case, and tootle-tooing away; while the coach-
man shook up his horses, and carried them along the
side of the school close, round Dead-man's corner,
past the school gates, and down the High Street, to
the Spread Eagle; the wheelers in a spanking trot,
and leaders cantering, in a style which would not have
disgraced “ Cherry Bob," "ramping, stamping, tear-
ing, swearing Billy Harwood,” or any other of the
old coaching heroes.
Tom's heart beat quick as he passed the great
school field or close, with its noble elms, in which
several games of football were going on, and tried to
take in at once the long line of grey buildings,
beginning with the chapel, and ending with the school-
house, the residence of the head-master, where the
great flag was lazily waving from the highest round
tower. And he began already to be proud of being
a Rugby boy, as he passed the school gates, with the
oriel window above, and saw the boys standing there,
looking as if the town belonged to them, and nodding
in a familiar manner to the coachman, as if any one
of them would be quite equal to getting on the
box, and working the team down street as well
as he.
One of the young heroes, however, ran out from
the rest, and scrambled up behind; where, having
righted himself, and nodded to the guard, with “How
do, Jem ?” he turned short round to Tom, and, after
looking him over for a minute, began-
“I say, you fellow, is your name Brown ? "
“Yes,” said Tom, in considerable astonishment ;
glad, however, to have lighted on some one already
who seemed to know him.
“Ah, I thought so; you know my old aunt,
Miss East; she lives somewhere down your way in

Berkshire. She wrote to me that you were coming
to-day, and asked me to give you a lift.”
Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patron-
izing air of his new friend, a boy of just about his own
height and age, but gifted with the most transcendent
coolness and assurance, which Tom felt to be aggra-
vating and hard to bear, but couldn't for the life of
him help admiring and envying—especially when
young my lord begins hectoring two or three long
loafing fellows, half porter, half stableman, with a
strong touch of the blackguard ; and in the end
arranges with one of them, nicknamed Cooey, to carry
Tom's luggage up to the school-house for sixpence.
“ And heark'ee, Cooey, it must be up in ten
minutes, or no more jobs from me. Come along,
Brown." And away swaggers the young potentate,
with his hands in his pockets, and Tom at his side.
“ All right, sir," says Cooey, touching his hat,
with a leer and a wink at his comrades.
“Hullo tho',” says East, pulling up, and taking
another look at Tom, “ this'll never do—haven't you
got a hat ?—we never wear caps here. Only the
louts wear caps. Bless you, if you were to go into the
quadrangle with that thing on, I don't know
what'd happen.” The very idea was quite beyond
young Master East, and he looked unutterabte things.
Tom thought his cap a very knowing affair, but
confessed that he had a hat in his hat-box; which
was accordingly at once extracted from the hind boot,
and Tom equipped in his go-to-meeting roof, as his
new friend called it. But this didn't quite suit his
fastidious taste in another minute, being too shiny ;
so, as they walk up the town, they dive into Nixon's
the hatter's, and Tom is arrayed, to his utter astonish-
ment, and without paying for it, in a regulation

catskin at seven-and-sixpence; Nixon undertaking to
send the best hat up to the matron's room, School-
house, in half-an-hour.
“You can send in a note for a tile on Monday, and
make it all right, you know,” said Mentor; “ we're
allowed two seven-and-sixers a half, besides what we
bring from home.”
Tom by this time began to be conscious of his new
social position and dignities, and to luxuriate in the
realized ambition of being a public school boy at last,
with a vested right of spoiling two seven-and-sixers
in half a year.
“ You see,” said his friend, as they strolled up
towards the school gates, in explanation of his
conduct—“ a great deal depends on how a fellow cuts
up at first. If he's got nothing odd about him, and
answers straightforward, and holds his head up, he
gets on. Now you'll do very well as to rig, all but that
cap. You see I'm doing the handsome thing by you
because my father knows yours; besides, I want to
please the old lady. She gave me half-a-sov. this
half, and perhaps'll double it next, if I keep in her
good books.”
East was great in the character of cicerone; he
carried Tom through the great gates, where were
only two or three boys. These satisfied themselves
with the stock questions,_“You fellow, what's your
name? Where do you come from? How old are
you? Where do you board ? and, What form are
you in?”—and so they passed on through the
quadrangle and a small courtyard, upon which looked
down a lot of little windows (belonging, as his guide
informed him, to some of the school-house studies),
into the matron's room, where East introduced Tom
to that dignitary ; made him give up the key of his

trunk, that the matron might unpack his linen, and
told the story of the hat and of his own presence of
mind : upon the relation whereof, the matron laugh-
ingly scolded him, for the coolest new boy in the
house; and East, indignant at the accusation of
newness, marched Tom off into the quadrangle, and
began showing him the schools, and examining him
as to his literary attainments; the result of which
was a prophecy that they would be in the same form,
and could do their lessons together.
“And now come in and see my study; we shall
have just time before dinner; and afterwards, before
calling over, we'll do the close.”
Tom followed his guide through the School-house
hall, which opens into the quadrangle. It is a great
room thirty feet long and eighteen high, or there-
abouts, with two great tables running the whole
length, and two large fireplaces at the side, with
blazing fires in them, at one of which some dozen
boys were standing and lounging, some of whom
shouted to East to stop ; but he shot through with
his convoy, and landed him in the long dark passages
with a large fire at the end of each, upon which the
studies opened. Into one of these, in the bottom
passage, East bolted with our hero, slamming and
bolting the door behind them, in case of pursuit from
the hall, and Tom was for the first time in a Rugby
boy's citadel.
He hadn't been prepared for separate studies, and
was not a little astonished and delighted with the
palace in question.
It wasn't very large certainly, being about six
feet long by four broad. It couldn't be called light,
as there were bars and a grating to the window ;
which little precautions were necessary in the studies

on the ground-floor looking out into the close, to pre-
vent the exit of small boys after locking-up, and the
entrance of contraband articles. But it was un-
commonly comfortable to look at, Tom thought.
The space under the window at the further end was
occupied by a square table covered with a reasonably
clean and whole red and blue check table-cloth ; a
hard-scated sofa covered with red stuff occupied one
side, running up to the end, and making a seat for
one, or by sitting close, for two, at the table ; and a
good stout wooden chair afforded a seat to another
boy, so that three could sit and work together. Over
the door were a row of hat-pegs, and on each side
bookcases with cupboards at the bottom; shelves
and cupboards being filled indiscriminately with
school-books, a cup or two, a mouse-trap and brass
candlesticks, leather straps, a fustian bag, and some
curious-looking articles, which puzzled Tom not a
little, until his friend explained that they were
climbing-irons, and showed their use. A cricket bat
and small fishing-rod stood up in one corner.
“And shall I have a study like this too ? ” said
Tom.
“Yes, of course, you'll be chummed with some
fellow on Monday, and you can sit here till then.”
“What nice places !”
“ They're well enough,” answered East, “ only
uncommon cold at nights sometimes. Gower—that's
my chum—and I make a fire with paper on the floor
after supper generally, only that it makes it so
smoky.”
“ But there's a big fire out in the passage,” said
Tom.
“ Precious little good we get of that tho',” said
East; “Jones the præpostor has the study at the

15
fire end, and he has rigged up an iron rod and green
baize curtain across the passage, which he draws at
night, and sits there with his door open, so he gets all
the fire, and hears if we come out of our studies after
eight, or make a noise. However, he's taken to sitting
in the fifth-form room lately, so we do get a bit of
fire now sometimes; only to keep a sharp look-out
that he don't catch you behind his curtain when he
comes down—that's all.”
A quarter-past one now struck, and the bell began
tolling for dinner, so they went into the hall and took
their places, Tom at the very bottom of the second
table, next to the præpostor (who sat at the end to
keep order there), and East a few paces higher. And
now Tom for the first time saw his future school-
fellows in a body. In they came, some hot and
ruddy from football or long walks, some pale and
chilly from hard reading in their studies, some from
loitering over the fire at the pastry-cook's, dainty
mortals, bringing with them pickles and sauce-bottles
to help them with their dinners. And a great big
bearded man, whom Tom took for a master, began
calling over the names, while the great joints were
being rapidly carved on a third table in the corner
by the old verger and the housekeeper. Tom's turn
came last, and meanwhile he was all eyes, looking
first with awe at the great man who sat close to him,
and was helped first, and who read a hard-looking
book all the time he was eating ; and when he got up
and walked off to the fire, at the small boys round him,
some of whom were reading, and the rest talking in
whispers to one another, or stealing one another's
bread, or shooting pellets, or digging their forks
through the table-cloth. However, notwithstanding
his curiosity, he managed to make a capital dinner

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
by the time the big man called “ Stand up !” and
said grace.
As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been
questioned by such of his neighbours as were curious
as to his birth, parentage, education, and other like
matters, East, who evidently enjoyed his new dignity
of patron and Mentor, proposed having a look at the
close, which Tom, athirst for knowledge, gladly
assented to, and they went out through the quad-
rangle and past the big fives court, into the great
playground.
“That's the chapel, you see,” said East, “and
there just behind it is the place for fights; you see
it's most out of the way of the masters, who all live
on the other side, and don't come by here after first
lesson or callings-over. That's when the fights come
off. And all this part where we are is the little side-
ground, right up to the trees, and on the other side
of the trees is the big side-ground, where the great
matches are played. And there's the island in the
furthest corner ; you'll know that well enough next
half, when there's island fagging. I say, it's horrid
cold, let's have a run across,” and away went East,
Tom close behind him. East was evidently putting
his best foot foremost, and Tom, who was mighty
proud of his running, and not a little anxious to show
his friend that although a new boy he was no milksop,
laid himself down to work in his very best style.
Right across the close they went, each doing all he
knew, and there wasn't a yard between them when
they pulled up at the island moat.
“I say,” said East, as soon as he got his wind,
looking with much increased respect at Tom, “ you
ain't a bad scud, not by no means. Well, I'm as
warm as a toast now.”

-
“ But why do you wear white trousers in
November ? " said Tom. He had been struck by
this peculiarity in the costume of almost all the
School-house boys.
“Why, bless us, don't you know ?—No, I forgot.
Why, to-day's the School-house match. Our house
plays the whole of the School at football. And we all
wear white trousers, to show 'em we don't care for
hacks. You're in luck to come to-day. You just
will see a match; and Brooke's going to let me play
in quarters. That's more than he'll do for any
other lower-school boy, except James, and he's
fourteen.”
“Who's Brooke ?"
“Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner,
to be sure. He's cock of the School, and head of the
School-house side, and the best kick and charger in
Rugby.”,
“Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell
me about it. I love football so, and have played all
my life. Won't Brooke let me play ?”
“Not he,” said East, with some indignation ;
“ why, you don't know the rules—you'll be a month
learning them. And then it's no joke playing up
in a match, I can tell you. Quite another thing from
your private school games. Why, there's been two
collar-bones broken this half, and a dozen fellows
lamed. And last year a fellow had his leg broken.”
Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this
chapter of accidents, and followed East across the
level ground till they came to a sort of gigantic
gallows of two poles eighteen feet high, fixed upright
in the ground some fourteen feet apart, with a cross
bar running from one to the other at the height of
ten feet or thereabouts.


## p. 18 (#36) ##############################################

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“ This is one of the goals,” said East," and you
see the other, across there, right opposite, under the
Doctor's wall. Well, the match is for the best of
three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins :
and it won't do, you see, just to kick the ball through
these posts, it must go over the cross bar; any
height'll do, so long as it's between the posts. You'll
have to stay in goal to touch the ball when it rolls
behind the posts, because if the other side touch it
they have a try at goal. Then we fellows in quarters,
we play just about in front of goal here, and have to
turn the ball and kick it back, before the big fellows
on the other side can follow it up. And in front of
us all the big fellows play, and that's where the
scrummages are mostly.”
Tom's respect increased as he struggled to make
out his friend's technicalities, and the other set to
work to explain the mysteries of " off your side,”
“ drop-kicks,” “punts," “ places,” and the other
intricacies of the great science of football.
“But how do you keep the ball between the
goals ? " said he; “I can't see why it mightn't go
right down to the chapel.”
“ Why, that's out of play,” answered East. “You
see this gravel-walk running down all along this side
of the playing-ground, and the line of elms opposite
on the other? Well, they're the bounds. As soon
as the ball gets past them, it's in touch, and out of
play. And then whoever first touches it, has to
knock it straight out amongst the players-up, who
make two lines with a space between them, every
fellow going on his own side. Ain't there just fine
scrummages then ! and the three trees you see there
which come out into the play, that's a tremendous
place when the ball hangs there, for you get

thrown against the trees, and that's worse than any
hack.”
Tom wondered within himself as they strolled
back again towards the fives court, whether the
matches were really such break-neck affairs as East
represented, and whether, if they were, he should
ever get to like them and play-up well.
He hadn't long to wonder, however, for next
minute East cried out, “Hurra! here's the punt-
about,-come along and try your hand at a kick.”
The punt-about is the practice ball, which is just
brought out and kicked about anyhow from one boy
to another before callings over and dinner, and at
other odd times. They joined the boys who had
brought it out, all small School-house fellows, friends
of East; and Tom had the pleasure of trying his
skill, and performed very creditably, after first
driving his foot three inches into the ground, and then
nearly kicking his leg into the air, in vigorous efforts
to accomplish a drop-kick after the manner of East.
Presently more boys and bigger came out, and
boys from other houses on their way to calling-over,
and more balls were sent for. The crowd thickened
as three o'clock approached; and when the hour
struck, one hundred and fifty boys were hard at work.
Then the balls were held, the master of the week came
down in cap and gown to calling-over, and the whole
school of three hundred boys swept into the big school
to answer to their names.
“I may come in, mayn't I ? " said Tom, catching
East by the arm and longing to feel one of them.
“Yes, come along, nobody'll say anything. You
won't be so eager to get into calling-over after a
month,” replied his friend ; and they marched into
the big school together, and up to the further end,


## p. 20 (#38) ##############################################

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
where that illustrious form, the lower fourth, which
had the honour of East's patronage for the time being,
stood.
The master mounted into the high desk by the
door, and one of the præpostors of the week stood by
him on the steps, the other three marching up and
down the middle of the school with their canes,
calling out“ Silence, silence !” The sixth form stood
close by the door on the left, some thirty in number,
mostly great big grown men, as Tom thought, survey-
ing them from a distance with awe. The fifth form
behind them, twice their number and not quite so big.
These on the left; and on the right the lower fifth,
shell, and all the junior forms in order, while up the
middle marched the three præpostors.
Then the præpostor who stands by the master
calls out the names, beginning with the sixth form,
and as he calls, each boy answers “Here” to his name,
and walks out. Some of the sixth stop at the door to
turn the whole string of boys into the close; it is
a great match day, and every boy in the school, will-he
nill-he, must be there. The rest of the sixth go
forward into the close, to see that no one escapes by
any of the side gates.
To-day, however, being the School-house match,
none of the School-house præpostors stay by the door
to watch for truants of their side; there is carte
blanche to the School-house fags to go where they
like. “They trust to our honour,” as East proudly
informs Tom ; “ they know very well that no School-
house boy would cut the match. If he did, we'd very
soon cut him, I can tell you."
The master of the week being short-sighted, and the
præpostors of the week small and not well up to their
work, the lower school boys employ the ten minutes


## p. 21 (#39) ##############################################

21
which elapse before their names are called, in pelting
one another vigorously with acorns, which fly about
in all directions. The small præpostors dash in every
now and then, and generally chastise some quiet,
timid boy who is equally afraid of acorns and canes,
while the principal performers get dexterously out
of the way; and so calling-over rolls on somehow,
much like the big world, punishments lighting on
wrong shoulders, and matters going generally in a
queer, cross-grained way, but the end coming some-
how, which is after all the great point. And now the
master of the week has finished, and locked up the big
school; and the præpostors of the week come out, sweep-
ing the last remnant of the school fags—who had been
loafing about the corners by the fives court, in hopes
of a chance of bolting—before them into the close.
“Hold the punt-about !” “To the goals ! ” are
the cries, and all stray balls are impounded by the
authorities; and the whole mass of boys moves up
towards the two goals, dividing as they go into three
bodies. That little band on the left, consisting of
from fifteen to twenty boys, Tom amongst them, who
are making for the goal under the School-house wall,
are the School-house boys who are not to play-up,
and have to stay in goal. The larger body moving
to the island goal, are the school-boys in a like pre-
dicament. The great mass in the middle are the
players-up, both sides mingled together; they are
hanging their jackets, and all who mean real work,
their hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, and braces,
on the railings round the small trees; and there they
go by twos and threes up to their respective grounds.
There is none of the colour and tastiness of get-up,
you will perceive, which lends such a life to the
present game at Rugby, making the dullest and

worst-fought match a pretty sight. Now each house
has its own uniform of cap and jersey, of some lively
colour : but at the time we are speaking of plush
caps have not yet come in, or uniforms of any sort
except the School-house white trousers, which are
abominably cold to-day: let us go to work, bare-
headed and girded with our plain leather straps—but
we mean business, gentlemen.
And now that the two sides have fairly sundered,
and each occupies its own ground, and we get a good
look at them, what absurdity is this? You don't
mean to say that those fifty or sixty boys in white
trousers, many of them quite small, are going to play
that huge mass opposite ? Indeed I do, gentlemen ;
they're going to try at any rate, and won't make such
a bad fight of it either, mark my word; for hasn't
old Brooke won the toss, with his lucky halfpenny,
and got choice of goals and kick-off ? The new ball
you may see lie there quite by itself, in the middle,
pointing towards the school or island goal ; in another
minute it will be well on its way there. Use that
minute in remarking how the School-house side is
drilled. You will see in the first place, that the sixth-
form boy, who has the charge of goal, has spread his
force (the goal-keepers) so as to occupy the whole
space behind the goal-posts, at distances of about
five yards apart; a safe and well kept goal is the
foundation of all good play. Old Brooke is talking
to the captain of quarters; and now he moves away ;
see how that youngster spreads his men (the light
brigade) carefully over the ground, half-way between
their own goal and the body of their own players-up
(the heavy brigade). These again play in several
bodies; there is young Brooke and the bull-dogs
mark them well—they are the “ fighting brigade,"

the “ die-hards,” larking about at leap-frog to keep
themselves warm, and playing tricks on one another.
And on each side of old Brooke, who is now standing
in the middle of the ground and just going to kick-off,
you see a separate wing of players-up, each with a
boy of acknowledged prowess to look to-here
Warner, and there Hedge; but over all is old Brooke,
absolute as he of Russia, but wisely and bravely
ruling over willing and worshipping subjects, a true
football king. His face is earnest and careful as he
glances a last time over his array, but full of pluck
and hope, the sort of look I hope to see in my general
when I go out to fight.
The School side is not organized in the same way.
The goal-keepers are all in lumps, anyhow and
nohow; you can't distinguish between the players-up
and the boys in quarters, and there is divided leader-
ship; but with such odds in strength and weight it
must take more than that to hinder them from
winning; and so their leaders seem to think, for they
let the players-up manage themselves.
But now, look, there is a slight move forward of
the School-house wings; a shout of“ Are you ready?"
and loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes half-a-
dozen quick steps, and away goes the ball spinning
towards the School goal; seventy yards before it
touches ground, and at no point above twelve or
fifteen feet high, a model kick-off ; and the School-
house cheer and rush on; the ball is returned, and they
meet it and drive it back amongst the masses of the
School already in motion. Then the two sides close,
and you can see nothing for minutes but a swaying
crowd of boys, at one point violently agitated. That
is where the ball is, and there are the keen players
to be met, and the glory and the hard knocks to be

got: you hear the dull thud thud of the ball, and the
shouts of “Off your side," "Down with him," "Put him
over,” “Bravo.” This is what we call a scrummage,
gentlemen, and the first scrummage in a School-house
match was no joke in the consulship of Plancus.
But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on
the School-house side, and a rush of the School carries
it past the School-house players-up. “ Look out in
quarters,” Brooke's and twenty other voices ring out;
no need to call tho', the School-house captain of
quarters has caught it on the bound, dodges the fore-
most School-boys, who are heading the rush, and sends
it back with a good drop-kick well into the enemy's
country. And then follows rush upon rush, and
scrummage upon scrummage, the ball now driven
through into the School-house quarters, and now
into the School goal; for the School-house have not
lost the advantage which the kick-off and a slight
wind gave them at the outset, and are slightly
“penning ” their adversaries.
The ball has just fallen again where the two sides
are thickest, and they close rapidly around it in a
scrummage ; it must be driven through now by force
or skill, till it flies out on one side or the other. Look
how differently the boys face it! Here come two
of the bull-dogs, bursting through the outsiders ;
in they go, straight to the heart of the scrummage,
bent on driving that ball out on the opposite side.
That is what they mean to do. My sons, my sons !
you are too hot; you have gone past the ball, and
must struggle now right through the scrummage,
and get round and back again to your own side,
before you can be of any further use. Here comes
young Brooke; he goes in as straight as you, but
keeps his head, and backs and bends, holding himself

still behind the ball, and driving it furiously when he
gets the chance. Take a leaf out of his book, you
young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, and Flash-
man the School-house bully, with shouts and great
action. Won't you two come up to young Brooke,
after locking-up, by the School-house fire, with “ Old
fellow, wasn't that just a splendid scrummage by the
three trees ? ” But he knows you, and so do we.
You don't really want to drive that ball through that
scrummage, chancing all hurt for the glory of the
School-house—but to make us think that's what you
want—a vastly different thing : and fellows of your
kidney will never go through more than the skirts of a
scrummage, where it's all push and no kicking.
We respect boys who keep out of it, and don't sham
going in; but you—we had rather not say what we
think of you.
Then the boys who are bending and watching on
the outside, mark them—they are most useful players,
the dodgers; who seize on the ball the moment it
rolls out from amongst the chargers, and away with
it across to the opposite goal; they seldom go into
the scrummage, but must have more coolness than the
chargers : as endless as are boys' characters, so are
their ways of facing or not facing a scrummage at
football.
Three-quarters of an hour are gone; first winds
are failing, and weight and numbers beginning to tell.
Yard by yard the School-house have been driven back
contesting every inch of ground. The bull-dogs are
the colour of mother earth from shoulder to ankle,
except young Brooke, who has a marvellous knack of
keeping his legs. The School-house are being penned
in their turn, and now the ball is behind their goal,
under the Doctor's wall. The Doctor and some of

his family are there looking on, and seem as anxious
as any boy for the success of the School-house. We
get a minute's breathing time before old Brooke kicks
out, and he gives the word to play strongly for touch,
by the three trees. Away goes the ball, and the bull-
dogs after it, and in another minute there is a shout of
“In touch,” “Our ball.” Now's your time, old
Brooke, while your men are still fresh. He stands
with the ball in his hand, while the two sides form in
deep lines opposite one another : he must strike it
straight out between them. The lines are thickest
close to him, but young Brooke and two or three of his
men are shifting up further, where the opposite line is
weak. Old Brooke strikes it out straight and strong,
and it falls opposite his brother. Hurra! that rush
has taken it right through the School-line, and away
past the three trees, far into their quarters, and young
Brooke and the bull-dogs are close upon it. The
School leaders rush back shouting“ Look out in goal,”
and strain every nerve to catch him, but they are after
the fleetest foot in Rugby. There they go straight for
the School goal-posts, quarters scattering before them.
One after another the bull-dogs go down, but young
Brooke holds on. “He is down.” No! a long
stagger, but the danger is past; that was the shock of
Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers. And now he is
close to the School goal, the ball not three yards
before him. There is a hurried rush of the School
fags to the spot, but no one throws himself on the ball,
the only chance, and young Brooke has touched it
right under the School goal-posts.
The School leaders come up furious, and administer
toco to the wretched fags nearest at hand; they may
well be angry, for it is all Lombard-street to a china
orange that the School-house kick a goal with the ball

touched in such a good place. Old Brooke of course
will kick it out, but who shall catch and place it ?
Call Crab Jones. Here he comes, sauntering along
with a straw in his mouth, the queerest, coolest fish
in Rugby: if he were tumbled into the moon this
minute, he would just pick himself up without taking
his hands out of his pockets or turning a hair. But
it is a moment when the boldest charger's heart beats
quick. Old Brooke stands with the ball under his
arm motioning the School back; he will not kick-
out till they are all in goal, behind the posts ; they
are all edging forwards, inch by inch, to get nearer
for the rush at Crab Jones, who stands there in front
of old Brooke to catch the ball. If they can reach
and destroy him before he catches, the danger is over ;
and with one and the same rush they will carry it
right away to the School-house goal. Fond hope !
it is kicked out and caught beautifully. Crab strikes
his heel into the ground, to mark the spot where the
ball was caught, beyond which the School line may
not advance; but there they stand, five deep, ready
to rush the moment the ball touches the ground.
Take plenty of room! don't give the rush a chance
of reaching you ! place it true and steady! Trust
Crab Jones-he has made a small hole with his heel
for the ball to lie on, by which he is resting on one
knee, with his eye on old Brooke. “Now!” Crab
places the ball at the word, old Brooke kicks, and it
rises slowly and truly as the School rush forward.
Then a moment's pause, while both sides look up
at the spinning ball. There it flies, straight between
the two posts, some five feet above the cross-bar, an
unquestioned goal; and a shout of real genuine joy
rings out from the School-house players-up, and a
faiņt echo of it comes over the close from the

keepers under the Doctor's wall. A goal in the first
hour-such a thing hasn't been done in the School-
house match this five years.
“Over !” is the cry: the two sides change goals,
and the School-house goal-keepers come threading
their way across through the masses of the School ;
the most openly triumphant of them, amongst whom
is Tom, a School-house boy of two hours' standing,
getting their ears boxed in the transit. Tom indeed is
excited beyond measure, and it is all the sixth-form
boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers, has been able
to do, to keep him from rushing out whenever the ball
has been near their goal. So he holds him by his side,
and instructs him in the science of touching.
“ Are you ready?” “ Yes.” And away comes
the ball kicked high in the air, to give the School time
to rush on and catch it as it falls. And here they
are amongst us. Meet them like Englishmen, you
School-house boys, and charge them home. Now is
the time to show what mettle is in you—and there
shall be a warm seat by the hall fire, and honour, for
him who does his duty in the next half-hour. And
they are well met. Again and again the cloud of
their players-up gathers before our goal and comes
threatening on, and Warner or Hedge, with young
Brooke and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through
and carry the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the
field like Job's war-horse, the thickest scrummage
parts asunder before his rush, like the waves before a
clipper's bows; his cheery voice rings over the field,
and his eye is everywhere. And if these miss the ball,
and it rolls dangerously in front of our goal, Crab
Jones and his men have seized it and sent it away
towards the sides with the unerring drop-kick. This
is worth living for; the whole sum of school-boy

RUGBY AND FOOTBALL
existence gathered up into one straining, struggling
half-hour, a half-hour worth a year of common life.
The quarter to five has struck, and the play
slackens for a minute before goal; but there is Crew,
the artful dodger, driving the ball in behind our goal,
on the island side, where our quarters are weakest.
Is there no one to meet him ? Yes! look at little
East! the ball is just at equal distances between
the two, and they rush together, the young man of
seventeen and the boy of twelve, and kick it at the
same moment. Crew passes on without a stagger ;
East is hurled forward by the shock, and plunges
ground; but the ball rises straight into the air, and
falls behind Crew's back, while the “bravos ” of the
School-house attest the pluckiest charge of all that
hard-fought day. Warner picks East up, lame and
half stunned, and he hobbles back into goal, con-
scious of having played the man.
And now the last minutes are come, and the School
gather for their last rush every boy of the hundred
and twenty who has a run left in him. Reckless of
the defence of their own goal, on they come across the
level big-side ground, the ball well down amongst
them, straight for our goal, like the column of the Old
Guard up the slope at Waterloo. All former charges
have been child's play to this. Warner and Hedge
have met them, but still on they come. The bull-
dogs rush in for the last time; they are hurled over
or carried back, striving hand, foot, and eyelids.
Old Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the
play, and turning short round, picks out the very
heart of the scrummage, and plunges in. It wavers
for a moment—he has the ball! No, it has passed
him, and his voice rings out clear over the advancing

tide, “ Look out in goa!." Crab Joces catches it for
a moment; but before he can kick, tie rush is upon
him and passes over him; and he pieks himself up
behind them with his straw in his mouth, a little
dirtier, but as cool as ever.
The ball rolls slowly in behird the School-house
goal, not three yards in front of a dozen of the biggest
School players-up.
There stands the School-house præpostor, safest of
goal-keepers, and Tom Brown by his side, who has
learned his trade by this time. Now is your time,
Tom. The blood of all the Browns is up, and the
two rush in together, and throw themselves on the
ball, under the very feet of the advancing column ;
the præpostor on his hands and knees arching his
back, and Tom all along on his face. Over them
topple the leaders of the rush, shooting over the back
of the præpostor, but falling flat on Tom, and knocking
all the wind out of his small carcase. “Our ball,”
says the præpostor, rising with his prize, “but get
up there, there's a little fellow under you.” They are
hauled up and roll off him, and Tom is discovered a
motionless body.
Old Brooke picks him up. “ Stand back, give
him air,” he says : and then feeling his limbs, adds,
“No bones broken. How do feel, young un?”
“Hah-hah,” gasps Tom as his wind comes back,
“ pretty well, thank you—all right.”
“Who is he ? ” says Brooke. “Oh, it's Brown,
he's a new boy; I know him," says East, coming
up.
“Well, he is a plucky youngster, and will make a
player,” says Brooke.
And five o'clock strikes. “No side" is called, and
the first day of the School-house match is over.

AFTER THE MATCH
CHAPTER III
AFTER THE MATCH
As the boys scattered away from the ground, and
East leaning on Tom's arm, and limping along, was
beginning to consider what luxury they should go and
buy for tea to celebrate that glorious victory, the two
Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight
of East, and stopped ; put his hand kindly on his
shoulder and said, “ Bravo, youngster, you played
famously; not much the matter, I hope ?"
“No, nothing at all,” said East, “ only a little
twist from that charge.”
“Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday;"
and the leader passed on, leaving East better for those
few words than all the opodeldoc in England would
have made him, and Tom ready to give one of his
ears for as much notice. Ah ! light words of those
whom we love and honour, what a power ye are, and
how carelessly wielded by those who can use you !
Surely for these things also God will ask an
account.
“ Tea's directly after locking-up, you see,” said
East, hobbling along as fast as he could, “ so you
come along down to Sally Harrowell's; that's our
School-house tuck shop-she bakes such stunning
murphies, we'll have a penn'orth each for tea ; come
along, or they'll all be gone."
Tom's new purse and money burnt in his pocket ;
he wondered, as they toddled through the quadrangle
and along the street, whether East would be insulted
if he suggested further extravagance, as he had not

32
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
sufficient faith in a pennyworth of potatoes. At last
he blurted out-
“I say, East, can't we get something else besides
potatoes ? I've got lots of money, you know.”
“Bless us, yes, I forgot,” said East, “ you've only
just come. You see all my tin's been gone this twelve
weeks, it hardly ever lasts beyond the first fortnight;
and our allowances were all stopped this morning for
broken windows, so I haven't got a penny. I've got
a tick at Sally's, of course ; but then I hate running
it high, you see, towards the end of the half, 'cause
one has to shell out for it all directly one comes back,
and that's a bore.”
Tom didn't understand much of this talk, but
seized on the fact that East had no money, and was
denying himself some little pet luxury in consequence.
“Well, what shall I buy ?" said he ; “ I'm uncommon
hungry.”
“ I say,” said East, stopping to look at him and
rest his leg, “ you're a trump, Brown. I'll do the
same by you next half. Let's have a pound of
sausages then; that's the best grub for tea I know
of."
“Very well,” said Tom, as pleased as possible ;
“ where do they sell them ?”
“Oh, over here, just opposite ; ” and they crossed
the street and walked into the cleanest little front
room of a small house, half parlour, half shop, and
bought a pound of most particular sausages; East
talking pleasantly to Mrs. Porter while she put them
in paper, and Tom doing the paying part.
From Porter's they adjourned to Sally Harrowell's,
where they found a lot of School-house boys waiting
for the roast potatoes, and relating their own exploits
in the day's match at the top of their voices. The

street opened at once into Sally's kitchen, a low brick-
floored room, with large recess for fire, and chimney-
corner seats. Poor little Sally, the most good-natured
and much-enduring of womankind, was bustling
about with a napkin in her hand, from her own oven
to those of the neighbours' cottages up the yard at
the back of her house.
East and Tom got served at last, and started back
for the School-house just as the locking-up bell began
to ring.
The lower schoolboys of the School-house, some
fifteen in number, had tea in the lower-fifth school,
and were presided over by the old verger or head-
porter, Each boy had a quarter of a loaf of bread
and pat of butter, and as much tea as he pleased ; and
there was scarcely one who didn't add to this some
further luxury, such as baked potatoes, a herring,
sprats, or something of the sort ; but few, at this
period of the half-year, could live up to a pound of
Porter's sausages, and East was in great magnificence
upon the strength of theirs. He had produced a
toasting-fork from his study, and set Tom to toast
the sausages, while he mounted guard over their
butter and potatoes; “'cause," as he explained,
“you're a new boy, and they'll play you some trick
and get our butter, but you can toast just as well as
I.” So Tom, in the midst of three or four more
urchins similarly employed, toasted his face and the
sausages at the same time before the huge fire, till the
latter cracked; when East from his watch-tower
shouted that they were done, and then the feast
proceeded, and the festive cups of tea were filled
and emptied, and Tom imparted of the sausages in
small bits to many neighbours, and thought he had

34
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
never tasted such good potatoes or seen such jolly
boys. They on their parts waived all ceremony, and
pegged away at the sausages and potatoes, and
remembering Tom's performance in goal, voted East's
new crony a brick. After tea, and while the things
were being cleared away, they gathered round the
fire, and the talk on the match still went on; and
those who had them to show, pulled up their trousers
and showed the hacks they had received in the good
cause.
Supper came in due course at seven o'clock,
consisting of bread and cheese and beer, which was
all saved for the singing; and directly afterwards
the fags went to work to prepare the hall. The
School-house hall, as has been said, is a great long
high room, with two large fires on one side, and two
large iron-bound tables, one running down the middle,
and the other along the wall opposite the fireplaces.
Around the upper fire the fags placed the tables in
the form of a horse-shoe, and upon them the jugs
with the Saturday night's allowance of beer. Then
the big boys began to drop in and take their seats,
bringing with them bottled beer and song-books ; for
although they all knew the songs by heart, it was the
thing to have an old manuscript book descended from
some departed hero, in which they were all carefully
written out.
The sixth-form boys had not yet appeared; so
to fill up the gap, an interesting and time-honoured
ceremony was gone through. Each new boy was
placed on the table in turn, and made to sing a solo,
under the penalty of drinking a large mug of salt and
water if he resisted or broke down. However, the
new boys all sing like nightingales to-night, and the
salt water is not in requisition ; Tom, as his part,

performing the old west-country song of “The
Leather Bottel” with considerable applause. And
at the half-hour down come the sixth and fifth form
boys, and take their places at the tables, which are
filled up by the next biggest boys, the rest, for whom
there is no room at the table, standing round outside.
Then Warner, the head of the house, gets up and
wants to speak, but he can't, for every boy knows
what's coming; and the big boys who sit at the tables
pound them and cheer; and the small boys who stand
behind pound one another, and cheer, and rush about
the hall cheering. Then silence being made, Warner
reminds them of the old School-house custom of
drinking the healths, on the first night of singing, of
those who are going to leave at the end of the half.
“He sees that they know what he is going to say
already—(loud cheers)—and so won't keep them, but
only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves. It is
the head of the eleven, the head of big-side football,
their leader on this glorious day-Pater Brooke ! ”
And away goes the pounding and cheering again,
becoming deafening when old Brooke gets on his
legs : till, a table having broken down, and a gallon
or so of beer been upset, and all throats getting dry,
silence ensues, and the hero speaks, leaning his hands
on the table, and bending a little forward. No action,
no tricks of oratory; plain, strong, and straight,
like his play.
“Gentlemen of the School-house! I am very
proud of the way in which you have received my
name, and I wish I could say all I should like in
return. But I know I sha’n’t. However, I'll do the
best I can to say what seems to me ought to be said
by a fellow who's just going to leave, and who has
spent a good slice of his life here. Eight years it is,

and eight such years as I can never hope to have again.
So now I hope you'll all listen to me-(loud cheers of
' that we will ')—for I'm going to talk seriously.
You're bound to listen to me, for what's the use of
calling me 'pater,' and all that, if you don't mind
what I say? And I'm going to talk seriously, because
I feel so. It's a jolly time, too, getting to the end of
the half, and a goal kicked by us first day—(tre-
mendous applause)-after one of the hardest and
fiercest day's play I can remember in eight years—
(frantic shoutings). The School played splendidly,
too, I will say, and kept it up to the last. That last
charge of theirs would have carried away a house.
I never thought to see anything again of old Crab
there, except little pieces, when I saw him tumbled
over by it—(laughter and shouting, and great slapping
on the back of Jones by the boys nearest him). Well,
but we beat 'em-(cheers). Aye, but why did we
beat 'em ? answer me that—(shouts of your play ').
Nonsense! 'Twasn't the wind and kick-off either-
that wouldn't do it. 'Twasn't because we've half-a-
dozen of the best players in the school, as we have.
I wouldn't change Warner, and Hedge, and Crab,
and the young un, for any six on their side—(violent
cheers). But half-a-dozen fellows can't keep it up
for two hours against two hundred. Why is it, then ?
I'll tell you what I think. It's because we've more
reliance on one another, more of a house feeling, more
fellowship than the School can have. Each of us
knows and can depend on his next-hand man better-
that's why we beat 'em to-day. We've union, they've
division—there's the secret-(cheers). But how's this
to be kept up ? How's it to be improved ? That's
the question. For I take it, we're all in earnest about
beating the School, whatever else we care about.

I know I'd sooner win two School-house matches
running than get the Balliol scholarship any day-
(frantic cheers).
“Now, I'm as proud of the house as any one.
I believe it's the best house in the school, out-and-
out-(cheers). But it's a long way from what I
want to see it. First, there's a deal of bullying going
on. I know it well. I don't pry about and interfere ;
that only makes it more underhand, and encourages
the small boys to come to us with their fingers in their
eyes telling tales, and so we should be worse off than
ever. It's very little kindness for the sixth to meddle
generally—you youngsters, mind that. You'll be
all the better football players for learning to stand it,
and to take your own parts, and fight it through.
But depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a house
like bullying. Bullies are cowards, and one coward
makes many; so good-bye to the School-house
match if bullying gets ahead here. (Loud applause
from the small boys, who look meaningly at Flashman
and other boys at the tables.) Then there's fuddling
about in the public-house, and drinking bad spirits,
and punch, and such rot-gut stuff.
“One other thing I must have a word about.
A lot of you think and say, for I've heard you, ' There's
this new Doctor hasn't been here so long as some of us,
and he's changing all the old customs. Rugby, and
the School-house especially are going to the dogs.
Stand up for the good old ways, and down with the
Doctor !' Now I'm as fond of old Rugby customs
and ways as any of you, and I've been here longer
than any of you, and I'll give you a word of advice in
time, for I shouldn't like to see any of you getting
sacked. “Down with the Doctor's ' easier said than
done. You'll find him pretty tight on his perch, I

take it, and an awkwardish customer to handle in that
line. Besides now, what customs has he put down ?
There was the good old custom of taking the linch-
pins out of the farmers' and bagmen's gigs at the
fairs, and a cowardly blackguard custom it was. We
all know what came of it, and no wonder the Doctor
objected to it. But, come now, any of you, name a
custom that he has put down.”
“ The hounds,” calls out a fifth-form boy, clad in
a green cutaway with brass buttons and cord trousers,
the leader of the sporting interest, and reputed a great
rider and keen hand generally.
“Well, we had six or seven mangey harriers and
beagles belonging to the house, I'll allow, and had had
them for years, and that the Doctor put them down.
But what good ever came of them ? Only rows with
all the keepers for ten miles round; and Big-side Hare-
and-hounds is better fun ten times over. What
else ?"
No answer.
“Well, I won't go on. Think it over for your-
selves : you'll find, I believe, that he don't meddle
with any one that's worth keeping. And mind now,
I say again, look out for squalls, if you will go your
own way, and that way ain't the Doctor's, for it'll
lead to grief. You all know that I'm not the fellow to
back a master through thick and thin. If I saw him
stopping football, or cricket, or bathing, or sparring,
I'd be as ready as any fellow to stand up about it.
But he don't-he encourages them; didn't you see
him out to-day for half-an-hour watching us ? (loud
cheers for the Doctor); and he's a strong true man,
and a wise one too, and a public school man too.
(Cheers.) And so let's stick to him, and talk no more
rot, and drink his health as the head of the house.

(Loud cheers.) And now I've done blowing up, and
very glad I am to have done. But it's a solemn
thing to be thinking of leaving a place which one has
lived in and loved for eight years; and if one can say
a word for the good of the old house at such a time,
why, it should be said, whether bitter or sweet. If
I hadn't been proud of the house and you—aye, no
one knows how proud—I shouldn't be blowing you
up. And now let's get to singing. But before I sit
down I must give you a toast to be drunk with three-
times-three and all the honours. It's a toast which
I hope every one of us, wherever he may go hereafter,
will never fail to drink when he thinks of the brave
bright days of his boyhood. It's a toast which should
bind us all together, and to those who've gone before,
and who'll come after us here. It is the dear old
School-house—the best house of the best school in
England !”
The last few words hit the audience in their weakest
place; they had been not altogether enthusiastic
at several parts of old Brooke's speech; but “the
best house of the best school in England” was too
much for them all, and carried even the sporting and
drinking interests off their legs into rapturous applause,
and it is to be hoped) resolutions to lead a new life
and remember old Brooke's words; which however
they didn't altogether do, as will appear hereafter.
Half-past nine struck in the middle of the per-
formance of “ Auld Lang Syne," a most obstreperous
proceeding; during which there was an immense
amount of standing with one foot on the table, knock-
ing mugs together and shaking hands, without which
accompaniments it seems impossible for the youth
of Britain to take part in that famous old song. The
under-porter of the School-house entered during the

performance, bearing five or six long wooden candle-
sticks, with lighted dips in them, which he proceeded
to stick into their holes in such part of the great
tables as he could get at; and then stood outside the
ring till the end of the song.
Then the quarter to ten struck, and the prayer-
bell rang. The sixth and fifth form boys ranged them-
selves in their school order along the wall, on either
side of the great fires, the middle fifth and upper
school boys round the long table in the middle of the
hall, and the lower school boys round the upper part
of the second long table, which ran down the side of
the hall furthest from the fires. Here Tom found
himself at the bottom of all, in a state of mind and
body not at all fit for prayers, as he thought; and
so tried hard to make himself serious, but couldn't,
for the life of him, do anything but repeat in his head
the choruses of some of the songs, and stare at all
the boys opposite, wondering at the brilliancy of their
waistcoats, and speculating what sort of fellows they
were. The steps of the head-porter are heard on the
stairs, and a light gleams at the door. “Hush !”
from the fifth-form boys who stand there, and then
in strides the Doctor, cap on head, book in one hand,
and gathering up his gown in the other. He walks
up the middle, and takes his post by Warner, who
begins calling over the names. The Doctor takes no
notice of anything, but quietly turns over his book
and finds the place, and then stands, cap in his hand
and finger in book, looking straight before his nose.
He knows better than any one when to look, and when
to see nothing; to-night is singing night, and there's
been lots of noise and no harm done; though some of
them do look hot and excited. So the Doctor sees
nothing, but fascinates Tom in a horrible manner as
though som
thing, but fascin and excited.

he stands there, and reads out the Psalm in that deep,
ringing, searching voice of his. Prayers are over,
and Tom still stares open-mouthed after the Doctor's
retiring figure, when he feels a pull at his sleeve, and
turning round sees East.
“I say, were you ever tossed in a blanket ?"
“No,” said Tom; “why ?"
"'Cause there'll be tossing to-night most likely,
before the sixth come up to bed. So if you funk, you
just come along and hide, or else they'll catch you
and toss you."
“Were, you ever tossed ? Does it hurt ?”
inquired Tom.
“Oh yes, bless you, a dozen times," said East, as
he hobbled along by Tom's side upstairs. “It don't
hurt unless you fall on the floor. But most fellows
don't like it."
They stopped at the fireplace in the top passage,
where were a crowd of small boys whispering together,
and evidently unwilling to go up into the bedrooms.
In a minute, however, a study door opened and a
sixth-form boy came out, and off they all scuttled
up the stairs, and then noiselessly dispersed to their
different rooms. Tom's heart beat rather quick as
he and East reached their room, but he had made up
his mind. “I sha'n't hide, East," said he.
“ Very well, old fellow," replied East, evidently
pleased; “no more shall I—they'll be here for us
directly."
The room was a great big one with a dozen beds in
it, but not a boy that Tom could see, except East and
himself. East pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and
then sat on the bottom of his bed, whistling, and
pulling off his boots; Tom followed his example.
A noise and steps are heard in the passage, the door

opens, and in rush four or five great fifth-form boys,
headed by Flashman in his glory.
Tom and East slept in the further corner of the
room, and were not seen at first.
“Gone to ground, eh ?” roared Flashman ;“ push
'em out then, boys ! look under the beds : " and he
pulled up the little white curtain of the one nearest
him. “Who-o-op,” he roared, pulling away at the
leg of a small boy, who held on tight to the leg of the
bed, and sung out lustily for mercy.
“Here, lend a hand, one of you, and help me pull
out this young howling brute. Hold your tongue,
sir, or I'll kill you."
“Oh, please, Flashman, please, Walker, don't
toss me! I'll fag for you, I'll do anything, only don't
toss me.”
“You be hanged,” said Flashman, lugging the
wretched boy along, “'twon't hurt you, — you !
Come along, boys, here he is.”
“I say, Flashey," sung out another of the big boys,
“ drop that; you heard what old Pater Brooke said
to-night. I'll be hanged if we'll toss anyone against
their will—no more bullying. Let him go, I
say."
Flashman, with an oath and a kick, released his
prey, who rushed headlong under his bed again, for
fear they should change their minds, and crept along
underneath the other beds, till he got under that of
the sixth-form boy, which he knew they daren't
disturb.
“ There's plenty of youngsters don't care about it,”
said Walker. “Here, here's Scud East—you'll be
tossed, won't you, young un?” Scud was East's
nickname, or Black, as we called it, gained by his
fleetness of foot.


## p. 43 (#61) ##############################################

AFTER THE MATCH 43
“Yes,” said East, “if you like, only mind my
foot."
“And here's another who didn't hide. Hullo !
new boy; what's your name, sir ? "
“ Brown.”
“ Well, Whitey Brown, you don't mind being
tossed ?"
“No,” said Tom, setting his teeth.
“ Come along then, boys,” sung out Walker, and
away they all went, carrying along Tom and East,
to the intense relief of four or five other small boys,
who crept out from under the beds and behind them.
“ What a trump Scud is !” said one. “They
won't come back here now."
“And that new boy, too; he must be a good
plucked one."
“Ah, wait till he's been tossed on to the floor ; see
how he'll like it then!”
Meantime the procession went down the passage
to Number 7, the largest room, and the scene of the
tossing, in the middle of which was a great open space.
Here they joined other parties of the bigger boys,
each with a captive or two, some willing to be tossed,
some sullen, and some frightened to death. At
Walker's suggestion all who were afraid were let off,
in honour of Pater Brooke's speech.
Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket
dragged from one of the beds. “In with Scud,
quick, there's no time to lose.” East was chucked
into the blanket. “ Once, twice, thrice, and away!”
up he went like a shuttlecock, but not quite up to the
ceiling.
“Now, boys, with a will,” cried Walker, “ once,
twice, thrice, and away!” This time he went clean
up, and kept himself from touching the ceiling with

his hand, and so again a third time, when he was turned
out, and up went another boy. And then came Tom's
turn. He lay quite still, by East's advice, and didn't
dislike the “ once, twice, thrice ; " but the “ away"
wasn't so pleasant. They were in good wind now,
and sent him slap up to the ceiling first time, against
which his knees came rather sharply. But the
moment's pause before descending was the rub, the
feeling of utter helplessness, and of leaving his whole
inside behind him sticking to the ceiling. Tom was
very near shouting to be set down, when he found
himself back in the blanket, but thought of East,
and didn't: and so took his three tosses without a
kick or a cry, and was called a young trump for his
pains.
He and East, having earned it, stood now looking
on. No catastrophe happened, as all the captives
were cool hands, and didn't struggle. This didn't
suit Flashman. What your real bully likes in tossing,
is when the boys kick and struggle, or hold on to one
side of the blanket, and so get pitched bodily on to the
floor; it's no fun to him when no one is hurt or
frightened.
“Let's toss two of them together, Walker,"
suggested he.
“ What a cursed bully you are, Flashey!”
rejoined the other. “Up with another one."
And so no two boys were tossed together, the
peculiar hardship of which is, that it's too much for
human nature to lie still then and share troubles ;
and so the wretched pair of small boys struggle in the
air which shall fall a-top in the descent, to the no small
risk of both falling out of the blanket, and the huge
delight of brutes like Flashman.
But now there's a cry that the præpostor of the

room is coming ; so the tossing stops, and all scatter
to their different rooms; and Tom is left to turn in,
with the first day's experience of a public school to
meditate upon.
CHAPTER IV
SETTLING TO THE COLLAR
It was a fine November morning, and the close soon
became alive with boys of all ages, who sauntered
about on the grass, or walked round the gravel walk,
in parties of two or three. East, still doing the
cicerone, pointed out all the remarkable characters to
Tom as they passed: Osbert, who could throw a
cricket-ball from the little side-ground over the rook
trees to the Doctor's wall; Gray, who had got the
Balliol scholarship, and, what East evidently thought
of much more importance, a half-holiday for the
School by his success; Thorne, who had run ten miles
in two minutes over the hour; Black, who had held
his own against the cock of the town in the last row
with the louts; and many more heroes, who then
and there walked about and were worshipped, all
trace of whom has long since vanished from the scene
of their fame; and the fourth-form boy who reads
their names rudely cut out on the old hall tables, or
painted upon the big side cupboard (if hall tables and
big side cupboards still exist), wonders what manner
of boys they were. It will be the same with you
who wonder, my sons, whatever your prowess may be,
in cricket, or scholarship, or football. Two or three

years, more or less, and then the steadily advancing,
blessed wave will pass over your names as it has
passed over ours. Nevertheless, play your games and
do your work manfully—see only that that be done,
and let the remembrance of it take care of itself.
But at afternoon chapel it was quite another thing.
Tom had spent the time after dinner in writing home
to his mother, and so was in a better frame of mind ;
and his first curiosity was over, and he could attend
more to the service. As the hymn after the prayers
was being sung, and the chapel was getting a little
dark, he was beginning to feel that he had been really
worshipping. And then came that great event in
his, as in every Rugby boy's life of that day—the
first sermon from the Doctor.
More worthy pens than mine have described that
scene. The oak pulpit standing out by itself above
the School seats. The tall gallant form, the kindling
eye, the voice, now soft as the low notes of a flute,
now clear and stirring as the call of the light infantry
bugle, of him who stood there Sunday after Sunday,
witnessing and pleading for his Lord, the King of
righteousness and love and glory, with whose Spirit
he was filled, and in whose power he spoke. The long
lines of young faces, rising tier above tier down the
whole length of the chapel, from the little boy's who
had just left his mother to the young man's who was
going out next week into the great world rejoicing
in his strength. It was a great and solemn sight,
and never more so than at this time of year, when
the only lights in the chapel were in the pulpit and at
the seats of the præpostors of the week, and the soft
twilight stole over the rest of the chapel, deepening
into darkness in the high gallery behind the organ.
But what was it after all which seized and held

47
these three hundred boys, dragging them out of
themselves, willing or unwilling, for twenty minutes,
on Sunday afternoons ? We couldn't enter into half
that we heard ; we hadn't the knowledge of our own
hearts or the knowledge of one another; and little
enough of the faith, hope, and love needed to that
end. But we listened, as all boys in their better
moods will listen (ay, and men too for the matter
of that), to a man whom we felt to be, with all his heart
and soul and strength, striving against whatever was
mean and unmanly and unrighteous in our little
world.
The next day Tom was duly placed in the third
form, and began his lessons in a corner of the big
School. He found the work very easy, as he had
been well grounded and knew his grammar by heart;
and, as he had no intimate companion to make him
idle (East and his other School-house friends being
in the lower-fourth, the form above him), soon gained
golden opinions from his master, who said he was
placed too low, and should be put out at the end of
the half-year. So all went well with him in School,
and he wrote the most flourishing letters home to
his mother, full of his own success and the unspeakable
delights of a public school.
In the house, too, all went well. The end of the
half-year was drawing near, which kept everybody in a
good humour, and the house was ruled well and
strongly by Warner and Brooke. True, the general
system was rough and hard, and there was bullying
in nooks and corners, bad signs for the future ; but
it never got further, or dared show itself openly,
stalking about the passages and hall and bedrooms,
and making the life of the small boys a continual
fear.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Tom
Tom, as a new boy, was of right excused fagging
for the first month, but in his enthusiasm for his new
life this privilege hardly pleased him; and East and
others of his young friends discovering this, kindly
allowed him to indulge his fancy, and take their
turns at night fagging and cleaning studies. These
were the principal duties of the fags in the house.
From supper until nine o'clock, three fags taken in
order stood in the passages, and answered any præ-
postor who called “Fag,” racing to the door, the
last comer having to do the work. This consisted
generally of going to the buttery for beer and bread
and cheese (for the great men did not sup with the
rest, but had each his own allowance in his study or
the fifth-form room), cleaning candlesticks and
putting in new candles, toasting cheese, bottling
beer, and carrying messages about the house; and
Tom, in the first blush of his hero-worship, felt it a
high privilege to receive orders from, and be the
bearer of the supper of old Brooke. And besides this
night-work, each præpostor had three or four fags
specially allotted to him, of whom he was supposed
to be the guide, philosopher, and friend, and who in
return for these good offices had to clean out his
study every morning by turns, directly after first
lesson and before he returned from breakfast. And
the pleasure of seeing the great men's studies, and
looking at their pictures, and peeping into their
books, made Tom a ready substitute for any boy
who was too lazy to do his own work. And so he
soon gained the character of a good-natured willing
fellow, who was ready to do a turn for any
one.
In all the games too he joined with all his heart,
and soon became well versed in all the mysteries of

football by continued practice at the School-house
little-side, which played daily.
The only incident worth recording here, however,
was his first run at Hare-and-hounds. On the last
Tuesday but one of the half-year, he was passing
through the hall after dinner, when he was hailed
with shouts from Tadpole and several other fags
seated at one of the long tables, the chorus of which
was, “ Come and help us tear up scent."
Tom approached the table in obedience to the
mysterious summons, always ready to help, and found
the party engaged in tearing up old newspapers,
copybooks, and magazines into small pieces, with
which they were filling four large canvas bags.
“It's the turn of our house to find scent for Big-
side Hare-and-hounds,” explained Tadpole; “ tear
away, there's no time to lose before calling-over."
“I think it's a great shame," said another small
boy, “ to have such a hard run for the last day.”
“ Which run is it ? " said Tadpole.
“Oh, the Barby run, I hear," answered the other,
“ nine miles at least, and hard ground; no chance of
getting in at the finish, unless you're a first-rate scud.”
“Well, I'm going to have a try," said Tadpole ;
“it's the last run of the half, and if a fellow gets in at
the end, Big-side stands ale and bread and cheese,
and a bowl of punch; and the Cock's such a famous
place for ale.”
“I should like to try too,” said Tom.
“ Well, then leave your waistcoat behind, and
listen at the door, after calling-over, and you'll hear
where the meet is.”
After calling-over, sure enough, there were two
boys at the door, calling out “ Big-side Hare-and-
hounds meet at White Hall ; ” and Tom having
E

girded himself with leather strap, and left all super-
fluous clothing behind, set off for White Hall, an old
gable-ended house some quarter of a mile from the
town, with East, whom he had persuaded to join,
notwithstanding his prophecy that they would never
get in, as it was the hardest run of the year.
At the meet they found some forty or fifty boys,
and Tom felt sure, from having seen many of them
run at football, that he and East were more likely
'to get in than they.
After a few minutes' waiting, two well-known
runners, chosen for the hares, buckled on the four
bags filled with scent, compared their watches with
those of young Brooke and Thorne, and started off
at a long slinging trot across the fields in the direction
of Barby.
Then the hounds clustered round Thorne, who
explained shortly, “ They're to have six minutes'
law. We run into the Cock, and every one who
comes in within a quarter of an hour of the hares 'll
be counted, if he has been round Barby church.”
Then came a minute's pause or so, and then the
watches are pocketed, and the pack is led through
the gateway into the field which the hares had first
crossed. Here they break into a trot, scattering
over the field to find the first traces of the scent which
the hares throw out as they go along. The old hounds
make straight for the likely points, and in a minute
a cry of“ forward " comes from one of them, and the
whole pack quickening their pace make for the spot,
while the boy who hit the scent first, and the two or
three nearest to him, are over the first fence, and
making play along the hedgerow in the long grass-
field beyond. The rest of the pack rush at the gap
already made and scramble through, jostling one

SETTLING TO THE COLLAR
51
another. “Forward” again, before they are half
through ; the pace quickens into a sharp run, the
tail hounds all straining to get up with the lucky
leaders. They are gallant hares, and the scent lies
thick right across another meadow and into a ploughed
field, where the pace begins to tell; then over a good
wattle with a ditch on the other side, and down a
large pasture studded with old thorns, which slopes
down to the first brook; the great Leicestershire
sheep charge away across the field as the pack comes
racing down the slope. The brook is a small one, and
the scent lies right ahead up the opposite slope, and
as thick as ever ; not a turn nor a check to favour the
tail hounds, who strain on, now trailing in a long line,
many a youngster beginning to drag his legs heavily
and feel his heart beat like a hammer, and the bad
plucked ones thinking that after all it isn't worth
while to keep it up.
Tom, East, and the Tadpole had a good start, and
are well up for such young hands, and after rising the
slope and crossing the next field, find themselves up
with the leading hounds who have overrun the scent
and are trying back; they have come a mile and a
half in about eleven minutes, a pace which shows that
it is the last day. About twenty-five of the original
starters only show here, the rest having already given
in; the leaders are busy making casts into the
fields on the left and right, and the others get their
second winds.
Then comes the cry of “forward” again, from
young Brooke, from the extreme left, and the pack
settles down to work again steadily and doggedly, the
whole keeping pretty well together. The scent
though still good is not so thick ; there is no need of
that, for in this part of the run every one knows the

52
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
line which must be taken, and so there are no casts
to be made, but good downright running and fencing
to be done. All who are now up mean coming in,
and they come to the foot of Barby Hill without losing
more than two or three more of the pack. This last
straight two miles and a half is always a vantage
ground for the hounds, and the hares know it well;
they are generally viewed on the side of Barby Hill,
and all eyes are on the look-out for them to-day.
But not a sign of them appears, so now will be the
hard work for the hounds, and there is nothing for it
but to cast about for the scent, for it is now the hares'
turn, and they may baffle the pack dreadfully in the
next two miles.
Ill fares it now with our youngsters that they are
School-house boys, and so follow young Brooke, for
he takes the wide casts round to the left, conscious
of his own powers and loving the hard work. For
if you would consider for a moment, you small boys,
you would remember that the Cock, where the run
ends, and the good ale will be going, lies far out to
the right on the Dunchurch road, so that every cast
you take to the left is so much extra work. And at
this stage of the run, when the evening is closing in
already, no one remarks whether you run a little
cunning or not, so you should stick to those crafty
hounds who keep edging away to the right, and not
follow a prodigal like young Brooke, whose legs are
twice as long as yours and of cast-iron, wholly in-
different to two or three miles more or less. However,
they struggle after him, sobbing and plunging along,
Tom and East pretty close, and Tadpole, whose big
head begins to pull him down, some thirty yards
behind.
Now comes a brook, with stiff clay banks, from


## p. 53 (#71) ##############################################

SETTLING TO THE COLLAR
53
which they can hardly drag their legs, and they hear
faint cries for help from the wretched Tadpole, who
has fairly stuck fast. But they have too little run
left in themselves to pull up for their own brothers.
Three fields more and another check, and then
“ forward " called away to the extreme right.
The two boys' souls die within them; they can
never do it. Young Brooke thinks so too, and says
kindly, “You'll cross a lane after next field, keep
down it, and you'll hit the Dunchurch road below the
Cock," and then steams away for the run in, in which
he's sure to be first, as if he were just starting. They
struggle on across the next field, the “forwards”
getting fainter and fainter, and then ceasing. The
whole hunt is out of ear-shot, and all hope of coming
in is over.
“Hang it all !” broke out East, as soon as he had
got wind enough, pulling off his hat and mopping at
his face, all spattered with dirt and lined with sweat,
from which went up a thick steam into the still cold
air. “I told you how it would be. What a thick I
was to come! Here we are dead beat, and yet I
know we're close to the run in, if we knew the country.”
“Well," said Tom, mopping away, and gulping
down his disappointment, “it can't be helped. We
did our best anyhow. Hadn't we better find this
lane and go down it, as young Brooke told us ?”
“I suppose so—nothing else for it," grunted East.
“ If ever I go out last day again,” growl-growl-
growl.
So they tried back slowly and sorrowfully, and
found the lane, and went limping down it, plashing
in the cold puddly ruts, and beginning to feel how
the run had taken it out of them. The evening closed
in fast, and clouded over, dark, cold, and dreary.


## p. 54 (#72) ##############################################

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“I say, it must be locking-up, I should think,”
remarked East, breaking the silence; “it's so dark."
“What if we're late ? " said Tom.
“No tea, and sent up to the Doctor,” answered
East.
The thought didn't add to their cheerfulness.
Presently a faint halloo was heard from an adjoining
field. They answered it and stopped, hoping for
some competent rustic to guide them, when over a
gate some twenty yards ahead crawled the wretched
Tadpole, in a state of collapse ; he had lost a shoe in
the brook, and been groping after it up to his elbows
in the stiff wet clay, and a more miserable creature
in the shape of boy seldom has been seen.
The sight of him, notwithstanding, cheered them,
for he was some degrees more wretched than they.
They also cheered him, as he was now no longer under
the dread of passing his night alone in the fields.
And so in better heart, the three plashed painfully
down the never-ending lane. At last it widened, just
as utter darkness set in, and they came out on to a
turnpike road, and there paused bewildered, for they
had lost all bearings, and knew not whether to turn
to the right or left.
Luckily for them they had not to decide, for
lumbering along the road, with one lamp lighted, and
two spavined horses in the shafts, came a heavy
coach, which after a moment's suspense they recog-
nized as the Oxford coach, the redoubtable Pig and
Whistle.
It lumbered slowly up, and the boys mustering
their last run, caught it as it passed, and began
scrambling up behind, in which exploit East missed his
footing and fell flat on his nose along the road. Then
the others hailed the old scarecrow of a coachman,

55
who pulled up and agreed to take them in for a
shilling ; so there they sat on the back seat, drubbing
with their heels, and their teeth chattering with cold,
and jogged into Rugby some forty minutes after
locking-up.
Five minutes afterwards, three small limping
shivering figures steal along through the Doctor's
garden, and into the house by the servants' entrance
(all the other gates have been closed long since),
where the first thing they light upon in the passage
is old Thomas, ambling along, candle in one hand and
keys in the other.
He stops and examines their condition with a grim
smile. “Ah! East, Hall, and Brown, late for locking-
up. Must go up to the Doctor's study at once.”
“ Well but, Thomas, mayn't we go and wash
first? You can put down the time, you know.”
“ Doctor's study d'rectly you come in—that's the
orders,” replied old Thomas, motioning towards the
stairs at the end of the passage which led up into the
Doctor's house; and the boys turned ruefully down
it, not cheered by the old verger's muttered remark,
“What a pickle they boys be in !" Thomas referred
to their faces and habiliments, but they construed it
as indicating the Doctor's state of mind. Upon the
short flight of stairs they paused to hold counsel.
“Who'll go in first ? " inquires Tadpole.
“ You—you're the senior," answered East.
“ Catch me—look at the state I'm in,” rejoined
Hall, showing the arms of his jacket. “I must get
behind you two."
“ Well, but look at me,” said East, indicating the
mass of clay behind which he was standing ; “ I'm
worse than you, two to one ; you might grow cabbages
on my trousers.”

“ That's all down below, and you can keep your
legs behind the sofa,” said Hall.
“Here, Brown, you're the show-figure—you must
lead.”
“But my face is all muddy,” argued Tom.
“Oh, we're all in one boat for that matter; but
come on, we're only making it worse, dawdling here.”
“Well, just give us a brush then," said Tom; and
they began trying to rub off the superfluous dirt from
each other's jackets, but it was not dry enough, and
the rubbing made it worse ; so in despair they pushed
through the swing-door at the head of the stairs, and
found themselves in the Doctor's hall.
“ That's the library door,” said East in a whisper,
pushing Tom forwards. The sound of merry voices
and laughter came from within, and his first hesitating
knock was unanswered. But at the second, the
Doctor's voice said “ Come in,” and Tom turned the
handle, and he, with the others behind him, sidled
into the room.
The Doctor looked up from his task; he was
working away with a great chisel at the bottom of a
boy's sailing boat. Round him stood three or four
children ; the candles burnt brightly on a large table
at the further end, covered with books and papers,
and a great fire threw a ruddy glow over the rest
of the room. All looked so kindly, and homely, and
comfortable, that the boys took heart in a moment,
and Tom advanced from behind the shelter of the
great sofa. The Doctor nodded to the children, who
went out, casting curious and amused glances at the
three young scarecrows.
“ Well, my little fellows," began the Doctor,
drawing himself up, with his back to the fire, the
chisel in one hand and his coat-tails in the other, and

his eyes twinkling as he looked them over; “what
makes you so late ?”
“Please, sir, we've been out Big-side Hare-and-
hounds, and lost our way.”
“Hah! you couldn't keep up, I suppose ?" .
“Well, sir,” said East, stepping out, and not
liking that the Doctor should think lightly of his
running powers, “we got round Barby all right,
but then- "
“Why, what a state you're in, my boy!” inter-
rupted the Doctor, as the pitiful condition of East's
garments was fully revealed to him.
“ That's the fall I got, in the road,” said East,
looking down at himself; “the Old Pig came by "
“ The what ? " said the Doctor.
“ The Oxford coach, sir,” explained Hall.
“Hah! yes, the Regulator,” said the Doctor.
“And I tumbled on my face, trying to get up
behind,” went on East.
“You're not hurt, I hope ?” said the Doctor.
“Oh no, sir.”
“ Well now, run upstairs, all three of you, and
get clean things on, and then tell the housekeeper to
give you some tea. You're too young to try such long
runs. Let Warner know I've seen you. Good-night.”
“Good-night, sir.” And away scuttled the three
boys in high glee.
“What a brick, not to give us even twenty lines
to learn!” said the Tadpole, as they reached their
bedroom; and in half an hour afterwards they were
sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room at a
sumptuous tea, with cold meat, “ twice as good a
grub as we should have got in the hall,” as the Tadpole
remarked with a grin, his mouth full of buttered toast.
All their grievances were forgotten, and they were

resolving to go out the first big-side next half, and
thinking Hare-and-hounds the most delightful of
games.
CHAPTER V
THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
The lower-fourth form in which Tom found himself
at the beginning of the next half-year was the largest
form in the lower school, and numbered upwards of
forty boys.
Tom, as has been said, had come up from the
third with a good character, but the temptations of
the lower-fourth soon proved too strong for him, and
he rapidly fell away, and became as unmanageable
as the rest.
But a character for steadiness once gone is not
easily recovered, as Tom found, and for years after-
wards he went up the school without it, and the
master's hands were against him, and his against them.
And he regarded them, as a matter of course, as his
natural enemies.
Matters were not so comfortable either in the
house as they had been, for old Brooke left at
Christmas, and one or two others of the sixth-form
boys at the following Easter. Their rule had been
rough, but strong and just in the main, and a higher
standard was beginning to be set up; in fact, there
had been a short foretaste of the good time which
followed some years later. Just now, however, all
threatened to return into darkness and chaos again.

. For the new præpostors were either small young boys,
whose cleverness had carried them up to the top of
the school, while in strength of body and character
they were not yet fit for a share in the government;
or else big fellows of the wrong sort, boys whose
friendships and tastes had a downward tendency,
who had not caught the meaning of their position and
work, and felt none of its responsibilities. So under
this no-government the School-house began to see
bad times.
The change for the worse in the School-house,
however, didn't press very heavily on our youngsters
for some time; they were in a good bedroom, where
slept the only præpostor left who was able to keep
thorough order, and their study was in his passage ;
so, though they were fagged more or less, and occasion-
ally kicked or cuffed by the bullies, they were on the
whole well off ; it wasn't till some year or so after the
events recorded above, that the præpostor of their
room and passage left. None of the other sixth-
form boys would move into their passage, and, to
the disgust and indignation of Tom and East, one
morning after breakfast they were seized upon by
Flashman, and made to carry down his books and
furniture into the unoccupied study which he had
taken. From this time they began to feel the weight
of the tyranny of Flashman and his friends, and, now
that trouble had come home to their own doors, began
to look out for sympathizers and partners amongst
the rest of the fags; and meetings of the oppressed
began to be held, and murmurs to arise, and plots to
be laid, as to how they should free themselves and be
avenged on their enemies.
While matters were in this state, East and Tom
were one evening sitting in their study. They had

60
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
done their work for first lesson, and Tom was in a.
brown study, brooding upon the wrongs of fags in
general, and his own in particular.
“I say, Scud,” said he at last, rousing himself
to snuff the candle, “ what right have the fifth-form
boys to fag us as they do ?”
“No more right than you have to fag them,”
answered East, without looking up from an early
number of “ Pickwick,” which was just coming out,
and which he was luxuriously devouring, stretched
on his back on the sofa.
Tom relapsed into his brown study, and East
went on reading and chuckling. The contrast of the
boys' faces would have given infinite amusement to a
looker-on, the one so solemn and big with mighty
purpose, the other radiant and bubbling over with
fun.
“Do you know, old fellow, I've been thinking it
over a good deal,” began Tom again.
“Oh yes, I know, fagging you are thinking of.
Hang it all; but listen here, Tom-here's fun.
Mr. Winkle's horse "
“And I've made up my mind,” broke in Tom,
" that I won't fag except for the sixth."
“Quite right, too, my boy,” cried East, putting
his finger on the place and looking up; “ but a pretty
peck of troubles you'll get into, if you're going to
play that game. However, I'm all for a strike myself,
if we can get others to join—it's getting too bad."
“ Can't we get some sixth-form fellow to take it
up ?” asked Tom.
"Well, perhaps we might; Morgan would inter-
fere, I think. Only,” added East, after a moment's
pause, “ you see we should have to tell him about
it, and that's against School principles. Don't you

remember what old Brooke said about learning to
take our own parts ?”
“Ah, I wish old Brooke were back again-it was
all right in his time.”
“Why, yes, you see, then the strongest and best
fellows were in the sixth, and the fifth-form fellows
were afraid of them, and they kept good order ; but
now our sixth-form fellows are too small, and the fifth
don't care for them,and do what they like in the house."
“ And so we get a double set of masters,” cried
Tom, indignantly; “ the lawful ones, who are re-
sponsible to the Doctor at any rate, and the unlawful
—the tyrants, who are responsible to nobody.”
“ Down with the tyrants ! ” cried East; “ I'm all
for law and order, and hurra for a revolution.”
“ I shouldn't mind if it were only for young Brooke
now," said Tom, “ he's such a good-hearted gentle-
manly fellow, and ought to be in the sixth-I'd do
anything for him. But that blackguard Flashman,
who never speaks to one without a kick and an
oath- "
“ The cowardly brute,” broke in East, “how I
hate him! And he knows it too, he knows that you
and I think him a coward. What a bore that he's
got a study in this passage ! don't you hear them
now at supper in his den? We must change our
study as soon as we can.”.
“Change or no change, I'll never fag for him again,”
said Tom, thumping the table.
“ Fa-a-a-ag!” sounded along the passage from
Flashman's study. The two boys looked at one
another in silence. It had struck nine, so the regular
night-fags had left duty, and they were the nearest
to the supper-party. East sat up, and began to look
comical, as he always did under difficulties.


## p. 62 (#80) ##############################################

62
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“Fa-a-a-ag!” again. No answer.
“Here, Brown! East ! you cursed young
skulks,” roared out Flashman, coming to his open
door, “ I know you're in—no shirking."
Tom stole to their door, and drew the bolts as
noiselessly as he could ; East blew out the candle.
“ Barricade the first," whispered he. “Now, Tom,
mind, no surrender.”
“ Trust me for that,” said Tom between his teeth.
In another minute they heard the supper-party
turn out and come down the passage to their door.
They held their breaths, and heard whispering, of
which they only made out Flashman's words, “I
know the young brutes are in.”
Then came summonses to open, which being un-
answered, the assault commenced : luckily the door
was a good strong oak one, and resisted the united
weight of Flashman's party. A pause followed, and
they heard a besieger remark, “ They're in, safe
enough-don't you see how the door holds at top and
bottom ? so the bolts must be drawn. We should
have forced the lock long ago." East gave Tom a
nudge, to call attention to this scientific remark.
Then came attacks on particular panels, one of
which at last gave way to the repeated kicks; but
it broke inwards, and the broken piece got jammed
across, the door being lined with green-baize, and
couldn't easily be removed from outside ; and the
besieged, scorning further concealment, strengthened
their defences by pressing the end of their sofa against
the door. So, after one or two more ineffectual
efforts, Flashman & Co. retired, vowing vengeance
in no mild terms.
The first danger over, it only remained for the
besieged to effect a safe retreat, as it was now near

63
bed-time. They listened intently, and heard the
supper-party resettle themselves, and then gently
drew back first one bolt and then the other. Presently
the convivial noises began again steadily. “ Now
then, stand by for a run," said East, throwing the
door wide open and rushing into the passage, closely
followed by Tom. They were too quick to be caught,
but Flashman was on the look-out, and sent an empty
pickle-jar whizzing after them, which narrowly missed
Tom's head, and broke into twenty pieces at the end
of the passage. “He wouldn't mind killing one if he
wasn't caught,” said East, as they turned the corner.
There was no pursuit, so the two turned into the
hall, where they found a knot of small boys round the
fire. Their story was told—the war of independence
had broken out—who would join the revolutionary
forces ? Several others present bound themselves not
to fag for the fifth form at once. One or two only
edged off, and left the rebels. What else could they
do ? “ I've a good mind to go to the Doctor straight,"
said Tom. :
“ That'll never do," put in another.
“ Well, then, let's try the sixth. Try Morgan,"
suggested another. “No use ”—“Blabbing won't
do," was the general feeling.
“I'll give you fellows a piece of advice,” said a
voice from the end of the hall. They all turned
round with a start, and the speaker got up from a
bench on which he had been lying unobserved, and
gave himself a shake; he was a big loose-made fellow,
with huge limbs which had grown too far through
his jacket and trousers. “Don't you go to anybody
at all—you just stand out; say you won't fag-
they'll soon get tired of licking you. I've tried it on
years ago with their forerunners.”.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“No! did you ?-tell us how it was,” cried a
chorus of voices, as they clustered round him.
“Well, just as it is with you. The fifth form would
fag us, and I and some more struck, and we beat 'em.
The good fellows left off directly, and the bullies who
kept on soon got afraid.”
“Was Flashman here then ?”
“ Yes! and a dirty little snivelling, sneaking
fellow he was too. He never dared join us, and used
to toady the bullies by offering to fag for them, and
peaching against the rest of us.”
“Why wasn't he cut then ?” said East.
“Oh, toadies never get cut, they're too useful.
Besides, he has no end of great hampers from home,
with wine and game in them; so he toadied and fed
himself into favour.”
The quarter-to-ten bell now rang, and the small
boys went off upstairs, still consulting together, and
praising their new counsellor, who stretched himself
out on the bench before the Hall fire again. There
he lay, a very queer specimen of boyhood, by name
Diggs, and familiarly called “ the Mucker.” He was
young for his size, and a very clever fellow, nearly at
the top of the fifth. His friends at home, having
regard, I suppose, to his age, and not to his size and
place in the school, hadn't put him into tails; and
even his jackets were always too small; and he had
a talent for destroying clothes, and making himself
look shabby. He wasn't on terms with Flashman's
set, who sneered at his dress and ways behind his
back; which he knew, and revenged himself by asking
Flashman the most disagreeable questions, and
treating him familiarly whenever a crowd of boys
were round him. Neither was he intimate with
any of the other bigger boys, who were warned off

65
by his oddnesses, for he was a very queer fellow ;
besides, amongst other failings, he had that of im-
pecuniosity in a remarkable degree. He brought as
much money as other boys to school, but got rid of it
in no time, no one knew how. And then, being also
reckless, borrowed from any one, and when his debts
accumulated and creditors pressed, would have an
auction in the Hall of everything he possessed in the
world, selling even his school-books, candlestick, and
study table. For weeks after one of these auctions,
having rendered his study uninhabitable, he would
live about in the fifth-form room and Hall, doing his
verses on old letter-backs and odd scraps of paper,
and learning his lessons no one knew how. He never
meddled with any little boy, and was popular with
them, though they all looked on him with a sort of
compassion, and called him“ poor Diggs,” not being
able to resist appearances, or to disregard wholly even
the sneers of their enemy Flashman. However, he
seemed equally indifferent to the sneers of big boys
and the pity of small ones, and lived his own queer life
with much apparent enjoyment to himself. It is
necessary to introduce Diggs thus particularly, as he
not only did Tom and East good service in their
present warfare, as is about to be told, but soon after-
wards, when he got into the sixth, chose them for his
fags, and excused them from study-fagging, thereby
earning unto himself eternal gratitude from them,
and all who are interested in their history.
And seldom had small boys more need of a friend,
for the morning after the siege the storm burst upon
the rebels in all its violence. Flashman laid wait,
and caught Tom before second lesson, and receiving
a point-blank “No,” when told to fetch his hat,
seized him and twisted his arm, and went through

66
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
the other methods of torture in use :-“ He couldn't
make me cry though,” as Tom said triumphantly to
the rest of the rebels, “ and I kicked his shins well,
I know.” And soon it crept out that a lot of the
fags were in league, and Flashman excited his
associates to join him in bringing the young vagabonds
to their senses; and the house was filled with constant
chasings, and sieges, and lickings of all sorts; and
in return, the bullies' beds were pulled to pieces,
and drenched with water, and their names written
up on the walls with every insulting epithet which
the fag invention could furnish. The war, in short,
raged fiercely; but soon, as Diggs had told them,
all the better fellows in the fifth gave up trying to
fag them, and public feeling began to set against
Flashman and his two or three intimates, and they
were obliged to keep their doings more secret, but
being thorough bad fellows, missed no opportunity
of torturing in private. Flashman was an adept in
all ways, but above all in the power of saying cutting
and cruel things, and could often bring tears to the
eyes of boys in this way, which all the thrashings in
the world wouldn't have wrung from them.
And as his operations were being cut short in
other directions, he now devoted himself chiefly to
Tom and East, who lived at his own door, and would
force himself into their study whenever he found a
chance, and sit there, sometimes alone, sometimes
with a companion, interrupting all their work, and
exulting in the evident pain which every now and
then he could see he was inflicting on one or the other.
The storm had cleared the air for the rest of the
house, and a better state of things now began than
there had been since old Brooke had left : but an
angry dark spot of thunder-cloud still hung over the

67
end of the passage, where Flashman's study and that
of East and Tom lay.
He felt that they had been the first rebels, and that
the rebellion had been to a great extent successful ;
but what above all stirred the hatred and bitterness
of his heart against them, was that in the frequent
collisions which there had been of late, they had
openly called him coward and sneak,—the taunts
were too true to be forgiven. While he was in the
act of thrashing them, they would roar out instances
of his funking at football, or shirking some encounter
with a lout of half his own size. These things were
all well enough known in the house, but to have his
disgrace shouted out by small boys, to feel that they
despised him, to be unable to silence them by any
amount of torture, and to see the open laugh and
sneer of his own associates (who were looking on, and
took no trouble to hide their scorn from him, though
they neither interfered with his bullying or lived a
bit the less intimately with him), made him beside
himself. Come what might, he would make those
boys' lives miserable. So the strife settled down
into a personal affair between Flashman and our
youngsters; a war to the knife to be fought out
in the little cockpit at the end of the bottom passage.
Flashman, be it said, was about seventeen years
old, and big and strong of his age. He played well
at all games where pluck wasn't much wanted, and
managed generally to keep up appearances where it
was; and having a bluff off-hand manner, which
passed for heartiness, and considerable powers of
being pleasant when he liked, went down with the
school in general for a good fellow enough. Even in
the School-house, by dint of his command of money,
the constant supply of good things which he kept up,


## p. 68 (#86) ##############################################

68
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
and his adroit toadyism, he had managed to make
himself not only tolerated but rather popular amongst
his own contemporaries; although young Brooke
scarcely spoke to him, and one or two others of the
right sort showed their opinions of him whenever a
chance offered. But the wrong sort happened to
be in the ascendant just now, and so Flashman was a
formidable enemy for small boys. This soon became
plain enough. Flashman left no slander unspoken,
and no deed undone, which could in any way hurt
his victims, or isolate them from the rest of the house.
One by one most of the other rebels fell away from
them, while Flashman's cause prospered, and several
other fifth-form boys began to look black at them
and ill-treat them as they passed about the house.
By keeping out of bounds, or at all events out of the
house and quadrangle, all day, and carefully barring
themselves in at night, East and Tom managed to
hold on without feeling very miserable ; but it was as
much as they could do. Greatly were they drawn
then towards old Diggs, who, in an uncouth way,
began to take a good deal of notice of them, and once
or twice came to their study when Flashman was
there, who immediately decamped in consequence.
The boys thought that Diggs must have been
watching.
When therefore, about this time, an auction was
one night announced to take place in the Hall, at
which, amongst the superfluities of other boys, all
Diggs' Penates for the time being were going to the
hammer, East and Tom laid their heads together,
and resolved to devote their ready cash (some four
shillings sterling) to redeem such articles as that sum
would cover. Accordingly they duly attended to
bid, and Tom became the owner of two lots of Diggs'

A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS
things ;-lot 1, price one-and-threepence, consisting
(as the auctioneer remarked) of a “ valuable assort-
ment of old metals,” in the shape of a mouse-trap,
a cheese-toaster without a handle, and a saucepan :
lot 2, of a villainous dirty table-cloth and green-baize
curtain; while East, for one-and-sixpence, purchased
a leather paper-case, with a lock but no key, once
handsome, but now much the worse for wear. But
they had still the point to settle, of how to get Diggs
to take the things without hurting his feelings. This
they solved by leaving them in his study, which was
never locked when he was out. Diggs, who had
attended the auction, remembered who had bought
the lots, and came to their study soon after, and sat
silent for some time, cracking his great red finger-
joints. Then he laid hold of their verses, and began
looking over and altering them, and at last got up,
and turning his back to them, said, “You're un-
common good-hearted little beggars, you two-I
value that paper-case, my sister gave it me last
holidays I won't forget ;” and so tumbled out into
the passage, leaving them somewhat embarrassed, but
not sorry that he knew what they had done.
CHAPTER VI
A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS
ONE evening, in forbidden hours, Tom and East were
in the Hall. They occupied the seats before the fire
nearest the door, while Diggs sprawled as usual
before the further fire. He was busy with a copy of

verses, and East and Tom were chatting together in
whispers by the light of the fire, and splicing a
favourite old fives-bat which had sprung. Presently
a step came down the bottom passage; they listened
a moment, assured themselves that it wasn't a
præpostor, and then went on with their work, and the
door swung open, and in walked Flashman. He
didn't see Diggs, and thought it a good chance to keep
his hand in ; and as the boys didn't move for him,
struck one of them, to make them get out of his way.
“What's that for ? ” growled the assaulted one.
“ Because I choose. You've no business here ;
go to your study.”
“ You can't send us.”
“Can't I ? Then I'll thrash you if you stay,"
said Flashman savagely.
“I say, you two,” said Diggs, from the end of
the Hall, rousing up and resting himself on his elbow,
“you'll never get rid of that fellow till you lick him.
Go in at him, both of you I'll see fair play.”
Flashman was taken aback, and retreated two
steps. East looked at Tom. “Shall we try ? ” said
he. “Yes," said Tom, desperately. So the two
advanced on Flashman with clenched fists and beating
hearts. They were about up to his shoulder, but
tough boys of their age and in perfect training; while
he, though strong and big, was in poor condition
from his monstrous habits of stuffing and want of
exercise. Coward as he was, however, Flashman
couldn't swallow such an insult as this; besides, he
was confident of having easy work, and so faced the
boys, saying, “ You impudent young blackguards !”
-Before he could finish his abuse, they rushed in on
him, and began pummelling at all of him which they
could reach. He hit out wildly and savagely, but the

full force of his blows didn't tell, they were too near
him. It was long odds, though, in point of strength,
and in another minute Tom went spinning backwards
over a form, and Flashman turned to demolish East,
with a savage grin. But now Diggs jumped down
from the table on which he had seated himself.
“ Stop there,” he shouted, “the round's over-half-
minute time allowed.”
“What the — is it to you ?” faltered Flashman,
who began to lose heart.
“I'm going to see fair play, I tell you,” said Diggs
with a grin, and snapping his great red fingers ;
"'taint fair for you to be fighting one of them at a
time. Are you ready, Brown? Time's up."
The small boys rushed in again. Closing they saw
was their best chance, and Flashman was wilder and
more flurried than ever : he caught East by the throat,
and tried to force him back on the iron-bound table ;
Tom grasped his waist, and, remembering the old
throw he had learned in the Vale from Harry Winburn,
crooked his leg inside Flashman's, and threw his whole
weight forward. The three tottered for a moment,
and then over they went on to the floor, Flashman
striking his head against a form in the fall.
The two youngsters sprang to their legs, but he
lay there still. They began to be frightened. Tom
stooped down, and then cried out, scared out of his
wits, “He's bleeding awfully; come here, East !
Diggs—he's dying !”
“Not he,” said Diggs, getting leisurely off the
table; “it's all sham-he's only afraid to fight it
out.”
East was as frightened as Tom. Diggs lifted
Flashman's head, and he groaned.
“ What's the matter ?" shouted Diggs.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“My skull's fractured,” sobbed Flashman.
“Oh, let me run for the housekeeper,” cried Tom.
" What shall we do ?”
“ Fiddlesticks! it's nothing but the skin broken,”
said the relentless Diggs, feeling his head. “Cold
water and a bit of rag's all he'll want."
“Let me go,” said Flashman, surlily, sitting up ;
“I don't want your help.”
“We're really very sorry," began East.
“Hang your sorrow," answered Flashman, holding
his handkerchief to the place; “ you shall pay for
this, I can tell you, both of you.” And he walked
out of the Hall.
“He can't be very bad," said Tom with a deep
sigh, much relieved to see his enemy march so well.
“Not he,” said Diggs,“ and you'll see you won't be
troubled with him any more. But I say, your head's
broken too—your collar is covered with blood.”
“Is it though ? " said Tom, putting up his hand;
“I didn't know it.”
“Well, mop it up, or you'll have your jacket
spoilt. And you have got a nasty eye, Scud; you'd
better go and bathe it well in cold water.”
“ Cheap enough too, if we've done with our old
friend Flashey,” said East, as they made off upstairs
to bathe their wounds.
They had done with Flashman in one sense, for
he never laid finger on either of them again ; but
whatever harm a spiteful heart and venomous tongue
could do them, he took care should be done. Only
throw dirt enough, and some of it is sure to stick ; and
so it was with the fifth form and the bigger boys in
general, with whom he associated more or less, and
they not at all. Flashman managed to get Tom and
East into disfavour, which did not wear off for some

time after the author of it had disappeared from the
School world. -
So East and Tom, the Tadpole, and one or two
more, became a sort of young Ishmaelites, their
hands against every one, and every one's hand
against them.
It was a toss-up whether they turned out well or
ill, and so they were just the boys who caused most
anxiety to such a master. You have been told of
the first occasion on which they were sent up to the
Doctor, and the remembrance of it was so pleasant
that they had much less fear of him than most boys
of their standing had. “It's all his look," Tom used
to say to East,“ that frightens fellows: don't you
remember, he never said anything to us my first
half-year, for being an hour late for locking up ?”
The next time that Tom came before him, however,
the interview was of a very different kind. It
happened just about the time at which we have now
arrived, and was the first of a series of scrapes into
which our hero managed now to tumble.
The river Ayon at Rugby is a slow and not very
clear stream, in which chub, dace, roach, and other
coarse fish are (or were) plentiful enough, together
with a fair sprinkling of small jack, but no fish worth
sixpence either for sport or food. It is, however, a
capital river for bathing, as it has many nice small
pools and several good reaches for swimming, all
within about a mile of one another, and at an easy
twenty minutes' walk from the school. This mile
of water is rented, or used to be rented, for bathing
purposes, by the Trustees of the School, for the boys.
The footpath to Brownsover crosses the river by “the
Planks,” a curious old single-plank bridge, running
for fifty or sixty yards into the flat meadows on each

side of the river,-for in the winter there are frequent
floods. Above the Planks were the bathing places for
the smaller boys; Sleath's, the first bathing place
where all new boys had to begin, until they had proved
to the bathing men (three steady individuals who were
paid to attend daily through the summer to prevent
accidents) that they could swim pretty decently,
when they were allowed to go on to Anstey's, about
one hundred and fifty yards below. Here there was
a hole about six feet deep and twelve feet across, over
which the puffing urchins struggled to the opposite
side, and thought no small beer of themselves for
having been out of their depths. Below the Planks
came larger and deeper holes, the first of which was
Wratislaw's, and the last Swift's, a famous hole ten
or twelve feet deep in parts, and thirty yards across,
from which there was a fine swimming reach right
down to the Mill. Swift's was reserved for the sixth
and fifth forms, and had a spring board and two sets
of steps : the others had one set of steps each, and
were used indifferently by all the lower boys, though
each house addicted itself more to one hole than to
another. The School-house at this time affected
Wratislaw's hole, and Tom and East, who had learnt
to swim like fishes, were to be found there as regular
as the clock through the summer, always twice and
often three times a day.
Now the boys either had, or fancied they had, a
right also to fish at their pleasure over the whole of
this part of the river, and would not understand that
the right (if any) only extended to the Rugby side.
As ill luck would have it, the gentleman who owned
the opposite bank, after allowing it for some time
without interference, had ordered his keepers not to
let the boys fish on his side ; the consequence of which

had been that there had been first wranglings and then
fights between the keepers and boys; and so keen
had the quarrel become that the landlord and his
keepers, after a ducking had been inflicted on one
of the latter, and a fierce fight ensued thereon, had
been up to the great school at calling-over to identify
the delinquents, and it was all the Doctor himself
and five or six masters could do to keep the peace.
Not even his authority could prevent the hissing, and
so strong was the feeling that the four præpostors of
the week walked up the school with their canes,
shouting s-s-s-s-i-lenc-c-c-c-e at the top of their
voices. However, the chief offenders for the time
were flogged and kept in bounds, but the victorious
party had brought a nice hornets' nest about their
ears. The landlord was hissed at the school gates as
he rode past, and when he charged his horse at the
mob of boys and tried to thrash them with his whip,
was driven back by cricket bats and wickets, and
pursued with pebbles and fives-balls; while the
wretched keepers' lives were a burthen to them, from
having to watch the waters so closely.
The School-house boys of Tom's standing, one and
all, as a protest against this tyranny and cutting short
of their lawful amusements, took to fishing in all
ways, and especially by means of night-lines. The
little tackle-maker at the bottom of the town would
soon have made his fortune had the rage lasted, and
several of the barbers began to lay in fishing tackle.
The boys had this great advantage over their enemies,
that they spent a large portion of the day in nature's
garb by the river side, and so when tired of swimming
would get out on the other side and fish, or set night-
lines till the keeper hove in sight, and then plunge in
and swim back and mix with the other bathers, and

the keepers were too wise to follow across the
stream.
While things were in this state, one day Tom and
three or four others were bathing at Wratislaw's,
and had, as a matter of course, been taking up and
re-setting night-lines. They had all left the water,
and were sitting or standing about at their toilets
in all costumes from a shirt upwards, when they were
aware of a man in a velveteen shooting-coat approach-
ing from the other side. He was a new keeper, so
they didn't recognise or notice him, till he pulled up
right opposite, and began :-
“I see'd some of you young gentlemen over this
side a-fishing just now.”
“Hullo, who are you? what business is that of
yours, old Velveteens ? "
“ I'm the new under-keeper, and master's told
me to keep a sharp look-out on all o' you young chaps.
And I tells 'ee I means business, and you'd better
keep on your own side, or we shall fall out."
“ Well, that's right, Velveteens-speak out, and
let's know your mind at once.”
“Look here, old boy,” cried East, holding up a
miserable coarse fish or two and a small jack, “ would
you like to smell 'em and see which bank they lived
under ?"
“I'll give you a bit of advice, keeper,” shouted
Tom, who was sitting in his shirt paddling with his
feet in the river ; “ you'd better go down there to
Swift's where the big boys are, they're beggars at
setting lines, and 'll put you up to a wrinkle or two
for catching the five-pounders.” Tom was nearest
to the keeper, and that officer, who was getting
angry at the chaff, fixed his eyes on our hero, as if
to take a note of him for future use. Tom returned

bis gaze with a steady stare, and then broke into a
laugh, and struck into the middle of a favourite
School-house song-
As I and my companions
Were setting of a snare,
The gamekeeper was watching us,
For him we did not care :
For we can wrestle and fight, my boys,
And jump out any where.
For it's my delight of a likely night,
In the season of the year.
The chorus was taken up by the other boys with
shouts of laughter, and the keeper turned away with
a grunt, but evidently bent on mischief. The boys
thought no more of the matter. .
But now came on the may-fly season; the soft
hazy summer weather lay sleepily along the rich
meadows by Avon side, and the green and grey flies
flickered with their graceful lazy up and down flight
over the reeds and the water and the meadows, in
myriads upon myriads. The may-flies must surely
be the lotus-eaters of the ephemeræ; the happiest,
laziest, carelessest fly that dances and dreams out
his few hours of sunshiny life by English rivers..
Every little pitiful coarse fish in the Avon was on
the alert for the flies, and gorging his wretched carcase
with hundreds daily, the gluttonous rogues ! and
every lover of the gentle craft was out to avenge the
poor may-flies.
So one fine Thursday afternoon, Tom having
borrowed East's new rod, started by himself to the
river. He fished for some time with small success,
not a fish would rise at him; but as he prowled along
the bank he was presently aware of mighty ones
feeding in a pool on the opposite side, under the
shade of a huge willow-tree. The stream was deep
here, but some fifty yards below was a shallow, for


## p. 78 (#96) ##############################################

78
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
which he made off hot-foot; and forgetting landlords,
keepers, solemn prohibitions of the Doctor, and
everything else, pulled up his trousers, plunged across,
and in three minutes was creeping along on all-fours
towards the clump of willows.
It isn't often that great chub, or any other coarse
fish, are in earnest about anything, but just then they
were thoroughly bent on feeding, and in half-an-hour
Master Tom had deposited three thumping fellows at
the foot of the giant willow. As he was baiting for a
fourth pounder, and just going to throw in again, he
became aware of a man coming up the bank not one
hundred yards off. Another look told him that it
was the under-keeper. Could he reach the shallow
before him ? No, not carrying his rod. Nothing
for it but the tree, so Tom laid his bones to it, shinning
up as fast as he could, and dragging up his rod after
him. He had just time to reach and crouch along
upon a huge branch some ten feet up, which stretched
out over the river, when the keeper arrived at the
clump. Tom's heart beat fast as he came under the
tree; two steps more and he would have passed,
when, as ill-luck would have it, the gleam on the
scales of the dead fish caught his eye, and he made
a dead point at the foot of the tree. He picked up
the fish one by one ; his eye and touch told him that
they had been alive and feeding within the hour.
Tom crouched lower along the branch, and heard the
keeper beating the clump. “If I could only get the
rod hidden,” thought he, and began gently shifting
it to get it alongside him ; “ willow-trees don't throw
out straight hickory shoots twelve feet long, with no
leaves, worse luck.” Alas! the keeper catches the
rustle, and then a sight of the rod, and then of Tom's
hand and arm.

and keeping as he takes to pic and then h
“Oh, be up ther' be 'ee ? ” says he, running under
the tree. “Now you come down this minute."
“ Tree'd at last,” thinks Tom, making no answer,
and keeping as close as possible, but working away at
the rod, which he takes to pieces : “ I'm in for it,
unless I can starve him out.” And then he begins
to meditate getting along the branch for a plunge, and
scramble to the other side ; but the small branches are
so thick, and the opposite bank so difficult, that the
keeper will have lots of time to get round by the ford
before he can get out, so he gives that up. And now
he hears the keeper beginning to scramble up the
trunk. That will never do; so he scrambles himself
back to where his branch joins the trunk, and stands
with lifted rod.
“Hullo, Velveteens, mind your fingers if you come
any higher.”
The keeper stops and looks up, and then with a
grin says, “Oh! be you, be it, young measter ?
Well, here's luck. Now I tells 'ee to come down at
once, and 't'll be best for 'ee.”
“ Thank’ee, Velveteens, I'm very comfortable,"
said Tom, shortening the rod in his hand, and pre-
paring for battle.
“ Werry well, please yourself,” says the keeper,
descending however to the ground again, and taking
his seat on the bank; “ I bean't in no hurry, so you
med' take yer time. I'll larn 'ee to gee honest folk
names afore I've done with 'ee.”
“My luck as usual,” thinks Tom; “ what a fool
I was to give him a black. If I'd called him 'keeper'
now I might get off. The return match is all his
way.”
• The keeper quietly proceeded to take out his pipe,
fill, and light it, keeping an eye on Tom, who now

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
sat disconsolately across the branch, looking at
keeper—a pitiful sight for men and fishes. The more
he thought of it the less he liked it. “ It must be
getting near second calling-over," thinks he. Keeper
smokes on stolidly. “If he takes me up, I shall be
flogged safe enough. I can't sit here all night.
Wonder if he'll rise at silver.
“I say, keeper,” said he, meekly," let me go for
two bob ?"
“Not for twenty neither,” grunts his persecutor.
And so they sat on till long past second calling-
over, and the sun came slanting in through the willow
branches, and telling of locking-up near at hand.
“I'm coming down, keeper," said Tom at last
with a sigh, fairly tired out. “Now what are you
going to do ?”
“ Walk 'ee up to School, and give 'ee over to the
Doctor ; them's my orders,” says Velveteens, knocking
the ashes out of his fourth pipe, and standing up and
shaking himself.
“ Very good,” said Tom; “but hands off, you
know. I'll go with you quietly, so no collaring or
that sort of thing.”
Keeper looked at him a minute—“ Werry good,”
said he at last; and so Tom descended, and wended
his way, drearily by the side of the keeper up to the
School-house, where they arrived just at locking up.
As they passed the School-gates, the Tadpole and
several others, who were standing there, caught the
state of things, and rushed out, crying, “ Rescue !"
but Tom shook his head, so they only followed to the
Doctor's gate, and went back sorely puzzled.
How changed and stern the Doctor seemed from
the last time that Tom was up there, as the keeper
told the story, not omitting to state how Tom called

A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS 81
him blackguard names. “Indeed, sir,” broke in
the culprit, “it was only Velveteens.” The Doctor
only asked one question.
“You know the rule about the banks, Brown ?”
“ Yes, sir.”
“ Then wait for me to-morrow, after first lesson."
“ I thought so," muttered Tom.
“And about the rod, sir ? ” went on the
keeper ; “Master's told we as we might have all the
rods- "
“Oh, please, sir,” broke in Tom, “the rod isn't
mine.” The Doctor looked puzzled, but the keeper,
who was a good-hearted fellow, and melted at Tom's
evident distress, gave up his claim. Tom was flogged
next morning, and a few days afterwards met Velve-
teens, and presented him with half-a-crown for
giving up the rod claim, and they became sworn
friends; and I regret to say that Tom had many
more fish from under the willow that may-fly season,
and was never caught again by Velveteens.
It wasn't three weeks before Tom, and now East
by his side, were again in the awful presence. This
time, however, the Doctor was not so terrible. A
few days before, they had been fagged at fives to
fetch the balls that went off the Court. While
standing watching the game, they saw five or six
nearly new balls hit on the top of the School. “I
say, Tom,” said East, when they were dismissed,
“ couldn't we get those balls somehow ?”
“Let's try, anyhow.”
So they reconnoitred the walls carefully, borrowed
a coal hammer from old Stumps, bought some big
nails, and after one or two attempts, scaled the Schools,
and possessed themselves of huge quantities of fives-
balls. The place pleased them so much that they

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
spent all their spare time there, scratching and cutting
their names on the top of every tower; and at last,
having exhausted all other places, finished up with
inscribing H. East, T. BROWN, on the minute-hand
of the great clock. In the doing of which, they held
the minute hand, and disturbed the clock's economy.
So next morning, when masters and boys came
trooping down to prayers, and entered the quad-
rangle, the injured minute-hand was indicating three
minutes to the hour. They all pulled up, and took
their time. When the hour struck, doors were closed,
and half the school late. Thomas being set to make
inquiry, discovers their names on the minute-hand,
and reports accordingly; and they are sent for, a
knot of their friends making derisive and pantomimic
allusions to what their fate will be, as they walk
off.
But the Doctor, after hearing their story, doesn't
make much of it, and only gives them thirty lines
of Homer to learn by heart, and a lecture on
the likelihood of such exploits ending in broken
bones.
Alas! almost the next day was one of the great
fairs in the town; and as several rows and other
disagreeable accidents had of late taken place on these
occasions, the Doctor gives out, after prayers in the
morning, that no boy is to go down into the town.
Wherefore East and Tom, for no earthly pleasure
except that of doing what they are told not to do,
start away, after second lesson, and making a short
circuit through the fields, strike a back lane which
leads into the town, go down it, and run plump upon
one of the masters as they emerge into the High
Street. The master in question, though a very clever,
is not a righteous man: he has already caught several

83
of his own pupils, and gives them lines to learn,
while he sends East and Tom, who are not his
pupils, up to the Doctor ; who, on learning that
they had been at prayers in the morning, flogs
them soundly.
The flogging did them no good at the time, for the
injustice of their captor was rankling in their minds;
but it was just the end of the half, and on the next
evening but one Thomas knocks at their door, and says
the Doctor wants to see them. They look at one
another in silent dismay. What can it be now ?
Which of their countless wrong-doings can he have
heard of officially? However, it's no use delaying,
so up they go to the study. There they find the
Doctor, not angry, but very grave. “He has sent
for them to speak very seriously before they go home
They have each been flogged several times in the half-
year for direct and wilful breaches of the rules. This
cannot go on. They are doing no good to themselves
or others, and now they are getting up in the School,
and have influence. They seem to think that rules
are made capriciously, and for the pleasure of the
masters; but this is not so, they are made for the good
of the whole School, and must and shall be obeyed.
Those who thoughtlessly or wilfully break them will
not be allowed to stay at the School. He should
be sorry if they had to leave, as the School might do
them both much good, and wishes them to think very
seriously in the holidays over what he has said.
Good-night.”
And so the two hurry off horribly scared : the idea
of having to leave has never crossed their minds, and
is quite unbearable.
As they go out, they meet at the door old Holmes,
a sturdy cheery præpostor of another house, who
lave, as the
seriously in auch good.

goes in to the Doctor; and they hear his genial
hearty greeting of the new-comer, so different to their
own reception, as the door closes, and return to their
study with heavy hearts, and tremendous resolves
to break no more rules.
Five minutes afterwards the master of their form,
a late arrival and a model young master, knocks at
the Doctor's study-door. “Come in !” and as he
enters the Doctor goes on to Holmes—" you see I do
not know anything of the case officially, and if I take
any notice of it at all, I must publicly expel the boy.
I don't wish to do that, for I think there is some good
in him. There's nothing for it but a good sound
thrashing." He paused to shake hands with the
master, which Holmes does also, and then prepares
to leave.
“I understand. Good-night, sir.”
“Good-night, Holmes. And remember," added
the Doctor, emphasizing the words, “a good sound
thrashing before the whole house."
The door closed on Holmes, and the Doctor, in
answer to the puzzled look of his lieutenant, explained
shortly. “A gross case of bullying. Wharton, the
head of the house, is a very good fellow, but slight
and weak, and severe physical pain is the only way
to deal with such a case; so I have asked Holmes to
take it up. He is very careful and trustworthy, and
has plenty of strength. I wish all the sixth had as
much. We must have it here, if we are to keep order
at all.”
After some other talk between them, the Doctor
said, “ I want to speak to you about two boys in your
form, East and Brown: I have just been speaking to
them. What do you think of them ?"
“ Well, they are not hard workers, and very

thoughtless and full of spirits—but I can't help
liking them. I think they are sound good fellows
at the bottom."
“I'm glad of it. I think so too. But they make
me very uneasy. They are taking the lead a good
deal amongst the fags in my house, for they are very
active bold fellows. I should be sorry to lose them,
but I sha'n't let them stay if I don't see them gaining
character and manliness. In another year they may
do great harm to all the younger boys.”
“Oh, I hope you won't send them away,” pleaded
their master.
“Not if I can help it. But now I never feel sure,
after any half-holiday, that I sha'n't have to flog one
of them next morning, for some foolish thoughtless
scrape. I quite dread seeing either of them.”
They were both silent for a minute. Presently
the Doctor began again :
“ They don't feel that they have any duty or work
to do in the School, and how is one to make them
feel it?"
“I think if either of them had some little boy to
take care of, it would steady them. Brown is the
most reckless of the two, I should say ; East wouldn't
get into so many scrapes without him.”
“Well,” said the Doctor, with something like a
sigh, “ I'll think of it.” And they went on to talk
of other subjects.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
CHAPTER VII
How THE TIDE TURNED
The turning-point in our hero's school career had
now come, and the manner of it was as follows. On
the evening of the first day of the next half-year,
Tom, East, and another School-house boy, who
had just been dropped at the Spread Eagle by the
old Regulator, rushed into the matron's room in
high spirits, such as all real boys are in when
they first get back, however fond they may be of
home.
“Well, Mrs. Wixie,” shouted one, seizing on the
methodical active little dark-eyed woman, who was
busy stowing away the linen of the boys who had
already arrived into their several pigeon-holes,“ here
we are again, you see, as jolly as ever. Let us help
you put the things away.”
“And Mary," cried another (she was called in-
differently by either name), “who's come back ?
Has the Doctor made old Jones leave? How many
new boys are there ?”
“ Am I and East to have Gray's study? You
know you promised to get it for us if you could,”
shouted Tom.
“And am I to sleep in Number 4?” roared
East.
“How's old Sam, and Bogle, and Sally ?”
“Bless the boys !” cries Mary, at last getting
in a word, “ why you'll shake me to death. There,
now do go away up to the housekeeper's room and
get your suppers; you know I haven't time to talk-


## p. 87 (#105) #############################################

HOW THE TIDE TURNED 87
you'll find plenty more in the house. Now, Master
East, do let those things alone—you're mixing up
three new boys' things.” And she rushed at East,
who escaped round the open trunks holding up a
prize.
“Hullo, look here, Tommy,” shouted he, here's
fun!” and he brandished above his head some
pretty little night-caps, beautifully made and marked,
the work of loving fingers in some distant country
home. The kind mother and sisters, who sewed
that delicate stitching with aching hearts, little.
thought of the trouble they might be bringing on the
young head for which they were meant. The little
matron was wiser, and snatched the caps from East
before he could look at the name on them.
“Now, Master East, I shall be very angry if you
don't go,” said she; “there's some capital cold
beef and pickles upstairs, and I won't have you old
boys in my room first night.”
“Hurrah for the pickles ! Come along, Tommy ;
come along, Smith. We shall find out who the young
Count is, I'll be bound : I hope he'll sleep in my room.
Mary's always vicious first week.”
As the boys turned to leave the room, the matron
touched Tom's arm, and said, “ Master Brown, please
stop a minute, I want to speak to you.”
“Very well, Mary. I'll come in a minute, East ;
don't finish the pickles— "
“Oh, Master Brown,” went on the little matron,
when the rest had gone, “ you're to have Gray's study,
Mrs. Arnold says. And she wants you to take in
this young gentleman. He's a new boy and thirteen
years old, though he don't look it. He's very delicate,
and has never been from home before. And I told
Mrs. Arnold I thought you'd be kind to him, and see

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
that they don't bully him at first. He's put into
your form, and I've given him the bed next to
yours in Number 4; so East can't sleep there this
half.”
Tom was rather put about by this speech. He
had got the double study which he coveted, but here
were conditions attached which greatly moderated
his joy. He looked across the room, and in the far
corner of the sofa was aware of a slight pale boy, with
large blue eyes and light fair hair, who seemed ready
to shrink through the floor. He saw at a glance that
the little stranger was just the boy whose first half-
year at a public school would be misery to himself if
he were left alone, or constant anxiety to any one who
meant to see him through his troubles. Tom was too
honest to take in the youngster and then let him shift
for himself; and if he took him as his chum instead
of East, where were all his pet plans of having a
bottled-beer cellar under his window, and making
night-lines and slings, and plotting expeditions to
Brownsover Mills and Caldecott's Spinney ? East
and he had made up their minds to get this study and
then every night from locking-up till ten they would
be together to talk about fishing, read Marryat's
novels, and sort birds' eggs. And this new boy would
most likely never go out of the close, and would be
afraid of wet feet, and always getting laughed at, and
called Molly, or Jenny.
The matron watched him for a moment, and saw
what was passing in his mind, and so, like a wise
negotiator, threw in an appeal to his warm heart.
“Poor little fellow,” said she in almost a whisper,
“his father's dead, and he's got no brothers. And
his mamma, such a kind sweet lady, almost broke
her heart at leaving him this morning; and she said

89
one of his sisters was like to die of decline, and
so_ "
“Well, well,” burst in Tom, with something like
a sigh at the effort, “ I suppose I must give up East.
Come along, young un. What's your name? We'll
go and have some supper, and then I'll show you
our study.”
“ His name's George Arthur,” said the matron,
walking up to him with Tom, who grasped his little
delicate hand as the proper preliminary to making a
chum of him, and felt as if he could have blown him
away. “I've had his books and things put into the
study, which his mamma has had new papered, and
the sofa covered, and new green baize curtains over
the door. And Mrs. Arnold told me to say," che
added, “ that she should like you both to come up
to tea with her. You know the way, Master Brown,
and the things are just gone up, I know.”
Here was an announcement for Master Tom! He
was to go up to tea the first night, just as if he were
- a sixth or fifth form boy, and of importance in the
school world, instead of the most reckless young
scapegrace amongst the fags. He felt himself lifted
on to a higher moral and social platform at once.
Nevertheless, he couldn't give up without a sigh the
idea of the jolly supper in the housekeeper's room
with East and the rest, and a rush round to all the
studies of his friends afterwards, to pour out the deeds
and wonders of the holidays, to plot fifty plans for
the coming half-year, and to gather news of who had
left and what new boys had come, who had got who's
study, and where the new præpostors slept. However,
Tom consoled himself with thinking that he couldn't
have done all this with the new boy at his heels, and
so marched off along the passages to the Doctor's

private house with his young charge in tow, in
monstrous good humour with himself and all the
world.
Besides Mrs. Arnold and one or two of the elder
children, there were one of the younger masters,
young Brooke, who was now in the sixth, and had
succeeded to his brother's position and influence,
and another sixth-form boy, talking together before
the fire. The master and young Brooke, now a
great strapping fellow six feet high, eighteen years
old, and powerful as a coal-heaver, nodded kindly
to Tom, to his intense glory, and then went on talking ;
the other did not notice them. The hostess, after a few
kind words, which led the boys at once insensibly
to feel at their ease, and to begin talking to one
another, left them with her own children while she
finished a letter. The young ones got on fast and
well, Tom holding forth about a prodigious pony he
had been riding out hunting, and hearing stories of
the winter glories of the lakes, when tea came in, and
immediately after the Doctor himself.
How frank, and kind, and manly was his greeting
to the party by the fire! It did Tom's heart good to
see him and young Brooke shake hands, and look one
another in the face; and he didn't fail to remark that
Brooke was nearly as tall and quite as broad as the
Doctor. And his cup was full, when in another
moment his master turned to him with another warm
shake of the hand, and, seemingly oblivious of all
the late scrapes which he had been getting into, said,
“ Ah, Brown, you here! I hope you left your father
and all well at home ?”
“Yes, sir, quite well.”
“And this is the little fellow who is to share
your study. Well, he doesn't look as we should like

to see him. He wants some Rugby air and cricket.
And you must take him some good long walks,
to Bilton Grange and Caldecott's Spinney, and
show him what a little pretty country we have
about here.”
Tom wondered if the Doctor knew that his visits
to Bilton Grange were for the purpose of taking
rooks' nests (a proceeding strongly discountenanced by
the owner thereof), and those to Caldecott's Spinney
were prompted chiefly by the conveniences for setting
night-lines. What didn't the Doctor know? And
what a noble use he always made of it! He almost
resolved to abjure rook-pies and night-lines for ever.
The tea went merrily off, the Doctor now talking of
holiday doings, and then of the prospects of the half-
year, what chance there was for the Balliol scholar-
ship, whether the eleven would be a good one. Every-
body was at his ease, and everybody felt that he,
young as he might be, was of some use in the little
School world, and had a work to do there.
Soon after tea the Doctor went off to his study,
and the young boys a few minutes afterwards took
their leave, and went out of the private door which
led from the Doctor's house into the middle
passage.
At the fire, at the further end of the passage, was
a crowd of boys in loud talk and laughter. There was
a sudden pause when the door opened, and then a
great shout of greeting, as Tom was recognized
marching down the passage.
“Hullo, Brown, where do you come from ? ”
“Oh, I've been to tea with the Doctor," says
Tom, with great dignity.
“My eye ! ” cried East. “Oh! so that's why
Mary called you back, and you didn't come to supper.

You lost something—that beef and pickles was no
end good.”
“I say, young fellow," cried Hall, detecting
Arthur and catching him by the collar, “what's
your name? Where do you come from? How old
are you?”
Tom saw Arthur shrink back and look scared as
all the group turned to him, but thought it best to
let him answer, just standing by his side to support
in case of need.
“ Arthur, sir. I come from Devonshire."
“Don't call me 'sir,' you young muff. How old
are you ?”
“ Thirteen.”
“ Can you sing?”
The poor boy was trembling and hesitating. Tom
struck in—“You be hanged, Tadpole. He'll have to
sing, whether he can or not, Saturday twelve weeks,
and that's long enough off yet.”
“Do you know him at home, Brown ?"
“No; but he's my chum in Gray's old study, and
it's near prayer time, and I haven't had a look at it
yet. Come along, Arthur.”
Away went the two, Tom longing to get his charge
safe under cover, where he might advise him on his
deportment.
6 What a queer chum for Tom Brown," was the
comment at the fire; and it must be confessed so
thought Tom himself, as he lighted his candle, and
surveyed the new green baize curtains and the
carpet and sofa with much satisfaction.
“I say, Arthur, what a brick your mother is to
make us so cosy. But look here now, you must
answer straight up when the fellows speak to you, and
don't be afraid. If you're afraid, you'll get bullied.

93
And don't you say you can sing; and don't you ever
talk about home, or your mother and sisters."
Poor little Arthur looked ready to cry.
“But please,” said he, “mayn't I talk about-
about home to you ?”.
“Oh yes, I like it. But don't talk to boys you
don't know, or they'll call you home-sick, or mamma's
darling, or some such stuff. What a jolly desk! Is
that yours? And what stunning binding! why,
your school-books look like novels !”
And Tom was soon deep in Arthur's goods and
chattels, all new, and good enough for a fifth-form
boy, and hardly thought of his friends outside till the
prayer bell rang.
I have already described the School-house prayers ;
they were the same on the first night as on the other
nights, save for the gaps caused by the absence of
those boys who came late, and the line of new boys
who stood all together at the further table-of all
sorts and sizes, like young bears with all their troubles
to come, as Tom's father had said to him when he
was in the same position. He thought of it as he
looked at the line, and poor little slight Arthur
standing with them, and as he was leading him
upstairs to Number 4, directly after prayers, and
showing him his bed. It was a huge, high, airy room,
with two large windows looking on to the School close.
There were twelve beds in the room. The one on
the furthest corner by the fireplace, occupied by
the sixth-form boy who was responsible for the
discipline of the room, and the rest by boys in the
lower-fifth, and other junior forms, all fags (for the
fifth-form boys, as has been said, slept in rooms by
themselves). Being fags, the eldest of them was not
more than about sixteen years old, and were all

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
bound to be up and in bed by ten; the sixth-form
boys came to bed from ten to a quarter-past (at
which time the old verger came round to put the
candles out), except when they sat up to read.
Within a few minutes therefore of their entry, all
the other boys who slept in Number 4 had come up.
The little fellows went quietly to their own beds, and
began undressing and talking to one another in
whispers; while the elder, amongst whom was Tom,
sat chatting about on one another's beds, with their
jackets and waistcoats off. Poor little Arthur was
overwhelmed with the novelty of his position. The
idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had
clearly never crossed his mind before, and was as
painful as it was strange to him. He could hardly
bear to take his jacket off ; however, presently, with
an effort, off it came, and then he paused and looked
at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of his bed
talking and laughing.
“Please, Brown,” he whispered, “ may I wash my
face and hands ?”
“Of course, if you like," said Tom, staring ;
“that's your washhand-stand, under the window,
second from your bed. You'll have to go down for
more water in the morning if you use it all.” And
on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly
from between the beds out to his washstand, and
began his ablutions, thereby drawing for a moment on
himself the attention of the room.
On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished
his washing and undressing, and put on his night-
gown. He then looked round more nervously than
ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in
bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The
light burned clear, the noise went on. It was a trying

95
moment for the poor little lonely boy; however, this
time he didn't ask Tom what he might or might not
do, but dropped on his knees by his bedside, as he had
done every day from his childhood, to open his heart
to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows
of the tender child, and the strong man in agony.
Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing
his boots, so that his back was towards Arthur, and
he didn't see what had happened, and looked up in
wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three
boys laughed and sneered, and a big brutal fellow,
who was standing in the middle of the room, picked
up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling
him a snivelling young shaver. Then Tom saw the
whole, and the next moment the boot he had just
pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully, who
had just time to throw up his arm and catch it on
his elbow.
“ Confound you, Brown, what's that for ?"
roared he, stamping with pain.
“Never mind what I mean," said Tom, stepping
on to the floor, every drop of blood in his body
tingling; “if any fellow wants the other boot, he
knows how to get it.”
What would have been the result is doubtful, for
at this moment the sixth-form boy came in, and not
another word could be said. Tom and the rest
rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there,
and the old verger, as punctual as the clock, had put
out the candle in another minute, and toddled on to
the next room, shutting their door with his usual
“ Good night, genl'm'n.”
There were many boys in the room by whom that
little scene was taken to heart before they slept.
But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow of poor

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Tom. For some time his excitement, and the flood
of memories which chased one another through his
brain, kept him from thinking or resolving. His
head throbbed, his heart leapt, and he could hardly
keep himself from springing out of bed and rushing
about the room. Then the thought of his own mother
came across him, and the promise he had made at
her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by his
bedside, and give himself up to his Father, before
he laid his head on the pillow, from which it might
never rise; and he lay down gently and cried as if his
heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.
It was no light act of courage in those days, my
dear boys, for a little fellow to say his prayers publicly,
even at Rugby. A few years later, when Arnold's
manly piety had begun to leaven the school, the
tables turned; before he died, in the School-house
at least, and I believe in the other houses, the rule
was the other way. But poor Tom had come to
school in other times. The first few nights after he
came he did not kneel down because of the noise,
but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then
stole out and said his prayers in fear lest some one
should find him out. So did many another poor
little fellow. Then he began to think that he might
just as well say his prayers in bed, and then that it
didn't matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting,
or lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom,
as with all who will not confess their Lord before men;
and for the last year he had probably not said his
prayers in earnest a dozen times.
Next morning he was up and washed and dressed,
all but his jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten
minutes' bell began to ring, and then in the face of
the whole room knelt down to pray Not five words

97
could he say—the bell mocked him ; he was listening
for every whisper in the room—what were they all
thinking of him? He was ashamed to go on kneeling,
ashamed to rise from his knees. At last, as it were
from his inmost heart, a still small voice seemed to
breathe forth the words of the publican, “God be
merciful to me a sinner !” He repeated them over
and over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose
from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready
to face the whole world. It was not needed : two
other boys besides Arthur had already followed his
example, and he went down to the great School with
a glimmering of another lesson in his heart—the
lesson that he who has conquered his own coward
spirit has conquered the whole outward world.
He found too how greatly he had exaggerated the
effect to be produced by his act. For a few nights
there was a sneer or a laugh when he knelt down,
but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other
boys but three or four followed the lead. I fear that
this was in some measure owing to the fact that Tom
could probably have thrashed any boy in the room
except the præpostor ; at any rate, every boy knew
that he would try upon very slight provocation, and
didn't choose to run the risk of a hard fight because
Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say his prayers.
Some of the small boys of Number 4 communicated
the new state of things to their chums, and in several
other rooms the poor little fellows tried it on; in
one instance or so, where the præpostor heard of it
and interfered very decidedly, with partial success;
but in the rest, after a short struggle, the confessors
were bullied or laughed down, and the old state of
things went on for some time longer. Before either
Tom Brown or Arthur left the School-house, there

was no room in which it had not become the regular
custom. I trust it is so still, and that the old heathen
state of things has gone out for ever.
CHAPTER VIII
THE NEw Boy
I do not mean to recount all the little troubles and
annoyances which thronged upon Tom at the beginning
of this half-year, in his new character of bear-leader to
a gentle little boy straight from home. He seemed to
himself to have become a new boy again, without
any of the long-suffering and meekness indispensable
for supporting that character with moderate success.
From morning till night he had the feeling of responsi-
bility on his mind, and even if he left Arthur in their
study or in the close for an hour, was never at ease
till he had him in sight again. He waited for him
at the doors of the school after every lesson and
every calling-over; watched that no tricks were
played on him, and none but the regulation questions
asked ; kept his eye on his plate at dinner and break-
fast, to see that no unfair depredations were made
upon his viands; in short, as East remarked, cackled
after him like a hen with one chick.
Arthur took a long time thawing too, which made
it all the harder work; was sadly timid; scarcely
ever spoke unless Tom spoke to him first; and,
worst of all, would agree with him in everything, the
hardest thing in the world for a Brown to bear. He
got quite angry sometimes, as they sat together of a

99
night in their study, at this provoking habit of agree-
ment, and was on the point of breaking out a dozen
times with a lecture upon the propriety of a fellow
having a will of his own and speaking out; but
managed to restrain himself by the thought that he
might only frighten Arthur, and the remembrance
of the lesson he had learnt from him on his first
night at Number 4. Then he would resolve to sit
still, and not say a word till Arthur began; but he
was always beat at that game, and had presently
to begin talking in despair, fearing lest Arthur might
think he was vexed at something if he didn't, and
dog-tired of sitting tongue-tied.
It was hard work ! But Tom had taken it up,
and meant to stick to it, and go through with it so
as to satisfy himself; in which resolution he was
much assisted by the chaffing of East and his other
old friends, who began to call him“ dry-nurse," and
otherwise to break their small wit on him. But when
they took other ground, as they did every now and
then, Tom was sorely puzzled.
“ Tell you what, Tommy,” East would say,
“ you'll spoil young Hopeful with too much coddling.
Why can't you let him go about by himself and find
his own level ? He'll never be worth a button, if
you go on keeping him under your skirts."
“Well, but he ain't fit to fight his own way yet ;
I'm trying to get him to it every day—but he's very
odd. Poor little beggar! I can't make him out a bit.
He ain't a bit like anything I've ever seen or heard
of-he seems all over nerves ; anything you say seems
to hurt him like a cut or a blow."
: “ That sort of boy's no use here,” said East,
“he'll only spoil. Now, I'll tell you what to do,
Tommy. Go and get a nice large band-box made,

and put him in with plenty of cotton wool and a
pap-bottle, labelled “With care—this side up,' and
send him back to mamma."
"I think I shall make a hand of him though,”
said Tom, smiling,“ say what you will. There's
something about him, every now and then, which
shows me he's got pluck somewhere in him. That's
the only thing after all that'll wash, ain't it, old
Scud? But how to get at it and bring it out ?”
Tom took one hand out of his breeches-pocket and
stuck it in his back hair for a scratch, giving his hat a
tilt over his nose, his one method of invoking wisdom.
He stared at the ground with a ludicrously puzzled
look, and presently looked up and met East's eyes.
That young gentleman slapped him on the back, and
then put his arm round his shoulder, as they strolled
through the quadrangle together. “ Tom,” said he,
“ blest if you ain't the best old fellow ever was—I
do like to see you go into a thing. Hang it, I wish I
could take things as you do—but I never can get higher
than a joke. Everything's a joke. If I was going
to be flogged next minute, I should be in a blue funk,
but I can't help laughing at it for the life of me.”
After the above conversation, East came a good
deal to their study, and took notice of Arthur; and
soon allowed to Tom that he was a thorough little
gentleman, and would get over his shyness all in good
time; which much comforted our hero. He felt
every day, too, the value of having an object in his
life, something that drew him out of himself; and,
it being the dull time of the year, and no games
going about for which he much cared, was happier
than he had ever yet been at school, which was say-
ing a great deal.
The time which Tom allowed himself away from

THE NEW BOY
101
his charge was from locking-up till supper-time.
During this hour or hour-and-a-half he used to take
his fling, going round to the studies of all his acquaint-
ance, sparring or gossiping in the Hall, now jumping
the old iron-bound tables, or carving a bit of his name
on them, then joining in some chorus of merry voices ;
in fact, blowing off his steam, as we should now call it.
This process was so congenial to his temper, and
Arthur showed himself so pleased at the arrangement,
that it was several weeks before Tom was ever in
their study before supper. One evening, however,
he rushed in to look for an old chisel, or some corks,
or other article essential to his pursuit for the time
being, and while rummaging about in the cupboards,
looked up for a moment, and was caught at once by
the figure of poor little Arthur. The boy was sitting
with his elbows on the table, and his head leaning
on his hands, and before him an open book, on which
his tears were falling fast. Tom shut the door at
once, and sat down on the sofa by Arthur, putting
his arm round his neck.
“Why, young un! what's the matter ? ” said he,
kindly ; “you ain't unhappy, are you?”
“Oh no, Brown,” said the little boy, looking up
with the great tears in his eyes, “ you are so kind to
me, I'm very happy.”
“Why don't you call me Tom ? lots of boys do
that I don't like half so much as you. What are you
reading, then ? Hang it, you must come about
with me, and not mope yourself,” and Tom cast down
his eyes on the book, and saw it was the Bible. He
was silent for a minute, and thought to himself,
“Lesson Number 2, Tom Brown," and then said
gently-
“I'm very glad to see this, Arthur, and ashamed

that I don't read the Bible more myself. Do you
read it every night before supper while I'm out ?”
“Yes."
“ Well, I wish you'd wait till afterwards, and then
we'd read together. But, Arthur, why does it make
you.com, it isn't was alive, w
“Oh, it isn't that I'm unhappy. But at home,
while my father was alive, we always read the lessons
after tea; and I love to read them over now, and try
to remember what he said about them. I can't
remember all, and I think I scarcely understand a
great deal of what I do remember. But it all comes
back to me so fresh, that I can't help crying sometimes
to think I shall never read them again with him."
After supper that night, and almost nightly for
years afterwards, Tom and Arthur, and by degrees
East occasionally, and sometimes one, sometimes
another, of their friends, read a chapter of the Bible
together, and talked it over afterwards. Tom was
at first utterly astonished, and almost shocked, at the
sort of way in which Arthur read the book, and talked
about the men and women whose lives were there told.
The first night they happened to fall on the chapters
about the famine in Egypt, and Arthur began talking
about Joseph as if he were a living statesman; just
as he might have talked about Lord Grey and the
Reform Bill; only that they were much more living
realities to him. The book was to him, Tom saw, the
most vivid and delightful history of real people, who
might do right or wrong, just like any one who was
walking about in Rugby—the Doctor, or the masters,
or the sixth-form boys. But the astonishment soon
passed off, the scales seemed to drop from his eyes,
and the book became at once and for ever to him
the great human and divine book, and the men and

103
women, whom he had looked upon as something
quite different from himself, became his friends and
counsellors.
For our purposes, however, the history of one
night's reading will be sufficient, which must be told
here, now we are on the subject, though it didn't
happen till a year afterwards, and long after the
events recorded in the next chapter of our story.
Arthur, Tom, and East were together one night,
and read the story of Naaman coming to Elisha to
be cured of his leprosy. When the chapter was
finished, Tom shut his Bible with a slap.
“I can't stand that fellow Naaman,” said he,
“ after what he'd seen and felt, going back and
bowing himself down in the house of Rimmon, because
his effeminate scoundrel of a master did it. I wonder
Elisha took the trouble to heal him. How he must
have despised him.”
“ Yes, there you go off as usual, with a shell on
your head,” struck in East, who always took the
opposite side to Tom; half from love of argument,
half from conviction. “How do you know he didn't
think better of it ? how do you know his master was
a scoundrel ? His letter don't look like it, and the
book don't say so.”
“I don't care," rejoined Tom; “why did Naaman
talk about bowing down, then, if he didn't mean to
do it ? He wasn't likely to get more in earnest when
he got back to court, and away from the prophet.”
“Well but, Tom,” said Arthur, “ look what
Elisha says to him, “Go in peace.' He wouldn't
have said that if Naaman had been in the wrong.”
“I don't see that that means more than saying,
• You're not the man I took you for.'”
“No, no, that won't do at all,” said East; “read

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
the words fairly, and take men as you find them.
I like Naaman, and think he was a very fine fellow."
“I don't," said Tom, positively.
“Well, I think East is right,” said Arthur; “I
can't see but what it's right to do the best you can,
though it mayn't be the best absolutely. Every
man isn't born to be a martyr.”
“Of course, of course," said East; “but he's on
one of his pet hobbies. How often have I told you,
Tom, that you must drive a nail where it'll go.”
“And how often have I told you,” replied Tom,
“ that it'll always go where you want, if you only
stick to it and hit hard enough. I hate half-measures
and compromises."
“ Yes, he's a whole-hog man, is Tom. Must
have the whole animal, hair and teeth, claws and
tail,” laughed East. “Sooner have no bread any
day than half the loaf.”
“I don't know," said Arthur, “it's rather
puzzling; but ain't most right things got by proper
compromises, I mean where the principle isn't
given up ?”
“That's just the point,” said Tom; “I don't
object to a compromise, where you don't give up
your principle.”
“Not you,” said East, laughingly. “I know him
of old, Arthur, and you'll find him out some day.
There isn't such a reasonable fellow in the world, to
hear him talk. He never wants anything but what's
right and fair; only when you come to settle what's
right and fair, it's everything that he wants, and
nothing that you want. And that's his idea of a
compromise. Give me the Brown compromise when
I'm on his side.”
“Now, Harry,” said Tom," no more chaff—I'm

serious. Look here—this is what makes my blood
tingle ; ” and he turned over the pages of his Bible
and read, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
answered and said to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar,
we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver
us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver
us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known
unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods,
nor worship the golden image which thou hast set
up.'” He read the last verse twice, emphasizing
the nots, and dwelling on them as if they gave him
actual pleasure, and were hard to part with.
They were silent a minute, and then Arthur said,
“ Yes, that's a glorious story, but it don't prove your
point, Tom, I think. There are times when there is
only one way, and that the highest, and then the men
are found to stand in the breach."
“There's always a highest way, and it's always
the right one,” said Tom. “How many times has
the Doctor told us that in his sermons in the last
year, I should like to know. ?”
“Well, you ain't going to convince us, is he,
Arthur ? No Brown compromise to-night,” said
East, looking at his watch. “But it's past eight,
and we must go to first lesson. What a bore !”
So they took down their books and fell to work;
but Arthur didn't forget, and thought long and often
over the conversation.

CHAPTER IX
ARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND
ABOUT six weeks after the beginning of the half, as
Tom and Arthur were sitting one night before supper
beginning their verses, Arthur suddenly stopped, and
looked up, and said, “ Tom, do you know anything
of Martin ?”
“ Yes," said Tom, taking his hand out of his back
hair, “I know him pretty well. He's a very good
fellow, but as mad as a hatter. He's called Madman,
you know. And never was such a fellow for getting
all sorts of rum things about him. He tamed two
snakes last half, and used to carry them about in his
pocket, and I'll be bound he's got some hedgehogs
and rats in his cupboard now, and no one knows
what besides.”
“I should like very much to know him," said
Arthur; “ he was next to me in the form to-day,
and he'd lost his book and looked over mine, and he
seemed so kind and gentle, that I like him very
much.”
“Ah, poor old Madman, he's always losing his
books," said Tom,“ and getting called up and floored
because he hasn't got them.”
“ I like him all the better," said Arthur.
“Well, he's great fun, I can tell you," said Tom,
throwing himself back on the sofa and chuckling at
the remembrance. “We had such a game with him
one day last half. He had been kicking up horrid
stinks for some time in his study, till I suppose some
fellow told Mary, and she told the Doctor. Anyhow,

one day a little before dinner, when he came down
from the library, the Doctor, instead of going home,
came striding into the Hall. East and I and five
or six other fellows were at the fire, and preciously
we stared, for he don't come in like that once a-year,
unless it's a wet day and there's a fight in the Hall.
' East,' says he, “just come and show me Martin's
study.' 'Oh, here's a game,' whispered the rest of us,
and we all cut upstairs after the Doctor, East leading.
As we got into the New Row, which was hardly wide
enough to hold the Doctor and his gown, click, click,
click, we heard in the old Madman's den. Then that
stopped all of a sudden, and the bolts went to like fun :
the Madman knew East's step, and thought there
was going to be a siege.
6. It's the Doctor, Martin. He's here and wants
to see you,' sings out East.
“ Then the bolts went back slowly, and the door
opened, and there was the old Madman standing,
looking precious scared ; his jacket off, his shirt-
sleeves up to his elbows, and his long skinny arms all
covered with anchors and arrows and letters, tattooed
in with gunpowder like a sailor-boy's, and a stink fit
to knock you down coming out. 'Twas all the Doctor
could do to stand his ground, and East and I, who
were looking in under his arms, held our noses tight.
The old magpie was standing on the window-sill,
all his feathers drooping, and looking disgusted and
half-poisoned.
«• What can you be about, Martin ?' says the
Doctor ; 'you really mustn't go on in this way,
you're a nuisance to the whole passage.'
" Please, Sir, I was only mixing up this powder,
there isn't any harm in it'; ' and the Madman seized
nervously on his pestle-and-mortar, to show the

Doctor the harmlessness of his pursuits, and went off
pounding ; click, click, click; he hadn't given six
clicks before, puff! up went the whole into a great
blaze, away went the pestle-and-mortar across the
study, and back we tumbled into the passage. The
magpie fluttered down into the court, swearing, and
the Madman danced out, howling, with his fingers in
his mouth. The Doctor caught hold of him, and
called to us to fetch some water. There, you silly
fellow,' said he, quite pleased though to find he wasn't
much hurt, “you see you don't know the least what
you are doing with all these things; and now, mind,
you must give up practising chemistry by yourself.'
Then he took hold of his arm and looked at it, and I
saw he had to bite his lip, and his eyes twinkled ; but
he said, quite grave, “Here, you see, you've been
making all these foolish marks on yourself, which you
can never get out, and you'll be very sorry for it in a
year or two: now come down to the housekeeper's
room, and let us see if you are hurt.' And away went
the two, and we all stayed and had a regular turn-
out of the den, till Martin came back with his hand
bandaged and turned us out. However, I'll go and
see what he's after, and tell him to come in after
prayers to supper.” And away went Tom to find
the boy in question, who dwelt in a little study by
himself, in New Row.
The aforesaid Martin, whom Arthur had taken
such a fancy for, was one of those unfortunates who
were at that time of day (and are, I fear, still) quite
out of their places at a public school. If we knew
how to use our boys, Martin would have been seized
upon and educated as a natural philosopher. He
had a passion for birds, beasts, and insects, and knew
more of them and their habits than any one in Rugby ;

except perhaps the Doctor, who knew everything.
He was also an experimental chemist on a small
scale, and had made unto himself an electric machine,
from which it was his greatest pleasure and glory
to administer small shocks to any small boys who
were rash enough to venture into his study. And
this was by no means an adventure free from excite-
ment; for, besides the probability of a snake dropping
on to your head or twining lovingly up your leg, or
a rat getting into your breeches-pocket in search of
food, there was the animal and chemical odour to
be faced, which always hung about the den, and the
chance of being blown up in some of the many
experiments which Martin was always trying, with
the most wondrous results in the shape of explosions
and smells that mortal boy ever heard of. Of course,
poor Martin, in consequence of his pursuits, had
become an Ishmaelite in the house. In the first
place, he half-poisoned all his neighbours, and they
in turn were always on the look-out to pounce upon
any of his numerous live-stock, and drive him frantic
by enticing his pet old magpie out of his window into
a neighbouring study, and making the disreputable
old bird drunk on toast soaked in beer and sugar.
Then Martin, for his sins, inhabited a study looking
into a small court some ten feet across, the window
of which was completely commanded by those of the
studies opposite in the Sick-room Row, these latter
being at a slightly higher elevation. East, and
another boy of an equally tormenting and ingenious
turn of mind, now lived exactly opposite, and had
expended huge pains and time in the preparation of
instruments of annoyance for the behoof of Martin
and his live colony. One morning an old basket made
its appearance, suspended by a short cord outside


## p. 110 (#128) ############################################

110
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Martin's window, in which were deposited an amateur
nest containing four young hungry jackdaws, the
pride and glory of Martin's life for the time being,
and which he was currently asserted to have hatched
upon his own person. Early in the morning and late
at night he was to be seen half out of window,
administering to the varied wants of his callow brood.
After deep cogitation, East and his chum had spliced
a knife on to the end of a fishing-rod; and having
watched Martin out, had, after half-an-hour's severe
sawing, cut the string by which the basket was
suspended, and tumbled it on to the pavement
below, with hideous remonstrance from the occupants.
Poor Martin, returning from his short absence,
collected the fragments and replaced his brood
(except one whose neck had been broken in the
descent) in their old location, suspending them this
time by string and wire twisted together, defiant
of any sharp instrument which his persecutors could
command. But, like the Russian engineers at
Sebastopol, East and his chum had an answer for
every move of the adversary; and the next day had
mounted a gun in the shape of a pea-shooter upon
the ledge of their window, trained so as to bear
exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy
while tending his nurslings. The moment he began
to feed, they began to shoot; in vain did the enemy
himself invest in a pea-shooter, and endeavour to
answer the fire while he fed the young birds with his
other hand; his attention was divided, and his
shots flew wild, while every one of theirs told on his
face and hands, and drove him into howlings and
imprecations. He had been driven to ensconce the
nest in a corner of his already too well-filled den.
His door was barricaded by a set of ingenious

bolts of his own invention, for the sieges were frequent
by the neighbours when any unusually ambrosial
odour spread itself from the den to the neighbouring
studies. The door panels were in a normal state of
smash, but the frame of the door resisted all besiegers,
and behind it the owner carried on his varied pursuits;
much in the same state of mind, I should fancy, as a
border-farmer lived in, in the days of the old moss-
troopers, when his hold might be summoned or his
cattle carried off at any minute of night or day.
“Open, Martin, old boy—it's only I, Tom Brown.”
“Oh, very well, stop a moment.” One bolt went
back. “You're sure East isn't there?”
“No, no, hang it, open.” Tom gave a kick, the
other bolt creaked, and he entered the den.
Den indeed it was, about five feet six inches long
by five wide, and seven feet high. About six tattered
school-books, and a few chemical books, Stanley on
Birds, and an odd volume of Bewick, the latter in
much better preservation, occupied the top shelves.
The other shelves, where they had not been cut away
and used by the owner for other purposes, were
fitted up for the abiding places of birds, beasts, and
reptiles. There was no attempt at carpet or curtain.
The table was entirely occupied by the great work
of Martin, the electric machine, which was covered
carefully with the remains of his table-cloth. The
jackdaw cage occupied one wall, and the other was
adorned by a small hatchet, a pair of climbing irons,
and his tin candle-box, in which he was for the time
being endeavouring to raise a hopeful young family
of field-mice. As nothing should be let to lie useless,
it was well that the candle-box was thus occupied, for
candles Martin never had. A pound was issued to
him weekly as to the other boys, but as candles were

available capital, and easily exchangeable for birds'-
eggs or young birds, Martin's pound invariably found
its way in a few hours to Howlett's the bird-fancier's,
in the Bilton Road, who would give a hawk's or
nightingale's egg or young linnet in exchange.
Martin's ingenuity was therefore for ever on the rack
to supply himself with a light; just now he had hit
upon a grand invention, and the den was lighted by a
flaring cotton-wick issuing from a ginger-beer bottle
full of some doleful composition. When light alto-
gether failed him, Martin would loaf about by the
fires in the passages or Hall, after the manner of
Diggs, and try to do his verses or learn his lines by the
fire-light.
“Well, old boy, you haven't got any sweeter
in the den this half. How that stuff in the bottle
stinks! Never mind, I ain't going to stop, but you
come up after prayers to our study; you know young
Arthur, we've got Gray's study. We'll have a good
supper and talk about birds’-nesting.”
Martin was evidently highly pleased at the
invitation, and promised to be up without fail.
As soon as prayers were over, and the sixth and
fifth-form boys had withdrawn to their own room,
and the rest had sat down to their supper in the
Hall; Tom and Arthur having secured their allow-
ances of bread and cheese, started on their feet to
catch the eye of the præpostor of the week, who
remained in charge during supper, walking up and
down the Hall. He happened to be an easy-going
fellow, so they got a pleasant nod to their “ Please,
may I go out ? ” and away they scrambled to prepare
for Martin a sumptuous banquet. This Tom had
insisted on, for he was in great delight on the occasion ;
the reason of which delight must be expounded.

ARTHUR MAKES A FRIEND
113
The fact was that this was the first attempt at a
friendship of his own which Arthur had made, and
Tom hailed it as a grand step. The ease with which
he himself became hail-fellow-well-met with anybody,
and blundered into and out of twenty friendships a
half-year, made him sometimes sorry and sometimes
angry at Arthur's reserve and loneliness. True,
Arthur was always pleasant, and even jolly, with any
boys who came with Tom to their study: but Tom
felt that it was only through him, as it were, that his
chum associated with others, and that but for him
Arthur would have been dwelling in a wilderness.
This increased his consciousness of responsibility;
and though he hadn't reasoned it out and made it
clear to himself, yet somehow he knew that this
responsibility, this trust which he had taken on him
without thinking about it, head-over-heels in fact,
was the centre and turning-point of his school-life,
that which was to make him or mar him ; his appointed
work and trial for the time being. And Tom was
becoming a new boy, though with frequent tumbles
in the dirt and perpetual hard battle with himself,
and was daily growing in manfulness and thoughtful-
ness, as every high-couraged and well-principled boy
must, when he finds himself for the first time con-
sciously at grips with self and the devil. Already he
could turn almost without a sigh from the school-
gates, from which had just scampered off East and
three or four others of his own particular set, bound
for some jolly lark not quite according to law, and
involving probably a row with louts, keepers, or
farm-labourers, the skipping dinner or calling-over,
and a very possible flogging at the end of all as a
relish. He had quite got over the stage in which he
would grumble to himself, “ Well, hang it, it's very

hard of the Doctor to have saddled me with Arthur.
Why couldn't he have chummed him with Fogey, or
Thomkin, or any of the fellows who never do any-
thing but walk round the close, and finish their
copies the first day they're set ? ” But although all
this was past, he often longed, and felt that he was
right in longing, for more time for the legitimate
pastimes of cricket, fives, bathing, and fishing within
bounds, in which Arthur could not yet be his com-
panion; and he felt that when the young un (as he
now generally called him) had found a pursuit and
some other friend for himself, he should be able to
give more time to the education of his own body with a
clear conscience.
And now what he so wished for had come to pass ;
he almost hailed it as a special providence (as indeed
it was, but not for the reason he gave for it-what
providences are ?) that Arthur should have singled
out Martin of all fellows for a friend. “The old
Madman is the very fellow," thought he; “he will
take him scrambling over half the country after birds'
eggs and flowers, make him run and swim and climb
like an Indian, and not teach him a word of anything
bad, or keep him from his lessons. What luck!"
And so, with more than his usual heartiness, he dived
into his cupboard, and hauled out an old knuckle-
bone of ham, and two or three bottles of beer, together
with the solemn pewter only used on state occasions ;
while Arthur, equally elated at the easy accomplish-
ment of his first act of volition in the joint establish-
ment, produced from his side a bottle of pickles and
a pot of jam, and cleared the table. In a minute or
two the noise of the boys coming up from supper was
heard, and Martin knocked and was admitted, bearing
his bread and cheese, and the three fell to with hearty

good-will upon the viands, talking faster than they
ate, for all shyness disappeared in a moment before
Tom's bottled-beer and hospitable ways. “Here's
Arthur, a regular young town-mouse, with a natural
taste for the woods, Martin, longing to break his
neck climbing trees, and with a passion for young
snakes.”
“Well, I say,” sputtered out Martin eagerly, “ will
you come to-morrow, both of you, to Caldecott's
Spinney, then, for I know of a kestrel's nest, up a
fir-tree—I can't get at it without help; and, Brown,
you can climb against any one.”
“Oh yes, do let us go,” said Arthur; “I never
saw a hawk's nest, or a hawk's egg."
“ You just come down to my study then, and
I'll show you five sorts,” said Martin.
“Aye, the old Madman has got the best collection
in the house, out-and-out,” said Tom; and then
Martin, warming with unaccustomed good cheer and
the chance of a convert, launched out into a proposed
birds'-nesting campaign, betraying all manner of
important secrets; a golden-crested wren's nest
near Butlin's Mound, a moor-hen who was sitting on
fourteen eggs in a pond down the Barby Road, and
a kingfisher's nest in a corner of the old canal above
Brownsover Mill. He had heard, he said, that no
one had ever got a kingfisher's nest out perfect, and
that the British Museum, or the Government, or
somebody, had offered £100 to any one who could
bring them a nest and eggs not damaged. In the
middle of which astounding announcement, to which
the others were listening with open ears, and already
considering the application of the £100, a knock came
to the door, and East's voice was heard craving
admittance.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“There's Harry,” said Tom; “ we'll let him in-
I'll keep him steady, Martin; I thought the old
boy would smell out the supper."
The fact was that Tom's heart had already
smitten him for not asking his friend to the feast,
and though prudence, and the desire to get Martin
and Arthur together alone at first, had overcome his
scruples, he was now heartily glad to open the door,
broach another bottle of beer, and hand over the old
ham-knuckle to the searching of his old friend's
pocket-knife.
“Ah, you greedy vagabonds,” said East, with his
mouth full, “I knew there was something going on
when I saw you cut off out of Hall so quick with
your suppers.
“Well, old Madman, and how goes the birds’-
nesting campaign ? How's Howlett ? I expect the
young rooks'll be out in another fortnight, and then
my turn comes."
“There'll be no young rooks fit for pies for a
month yet; shows how much you know about it,"
rejoined Martin, who, though very good friends with
East, regarded him with considerable suspicion for
his propensity to practical jokes.
“Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but
grub and mischief,” said Tom; “but young rook
pie, especially when you've had to climb for them, is
very pretty eating. However, I say, Scud, we're all
going after a hawk's nest to-morrow, in Caldecott's
Spinney; and if you'll come and behave yourself,
we'll have a stunning climb.”

CHAPTER X
THE BIRD-FANCIERS
THE next morning at first lesson Tom was turned
back in his lines, and so had to wait till the second
round, while Martin and Arthur said theirs all right
and got out of school at once. When Tom got out
and ran down to breakfast at Harrowell's they were
missing, and Stumps informed him that they had
swallowed down their breakfasts and gone off together,
where, he couldn't say Tom hurried over his own
breakfast, and went first to Martin's study and then
to his own, but no signs of the missing boys were to
be found. He felt half angry and jealous of Martin-
where could they be gone? He learnt second
lesson with East and the rest in no very good temper,
and then went out into the quadrangle. About ten
minutes before school Martin and Arthur arrived in
the quadrangle breathless; and, catching sight of
him, Arthur rushed up all excitement and with a
bright glow on his face.
“Oh, Tom, look here,” cried he, holding out three
moor-hen's eggs; “ we've been down the Barby Road
to the pool Martin told us of last night, and just see
what we've got.”
Tom wouldn't be pleased, and only looked out
for something to find fault with.
“Why, young un," said he, “what have you
been after ? You don't mean to say you've been
wading ?"
The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur
shrink up in a moment and look piteous, and Tom

with a shrug of his shoulders turned his anger on
Martin.
“Well, I didn't think, Madman, that you'd have
been such a muff as to let him be getting wet through
at this time of day. You might have done the
wading yourself.”
“So I did, of course ; only he would come in too
to see the nest. We left eleven eggs in ; they'll be
hatched in a day or two.”
“Hang the eggs !” said Tom; "a fellow can't
turn his back for a moment but all his work's undone.
He'll be laid up for a week for this precious lark, I'll
be bound.”
“Indeed, Tom, now," pleaded Arthur,“ my feet
ain't wet, for Martin made me take off my shoes and
stockings and trousers.”
“But they are wet and dirty too—can't I see ?”
answered Tom; “ and you'll be called up and floored
when the master sees what a state you're in. You
haven't looked at second lesson, you know.” Oh
Tom, you old humbug ! you to be upbraiding any one
with not learning their lessons. If you hadn't been
floored yourself now at first lesson, do you mean to
say you wouldn't have been with them ? and you've
taken away all poor little Arthur's joy and pride in
his first birds' eggs, and he goes and puts them down
in the study, and takes down his books with a sigh,
thinking he has done something horribly wrong,
whereas he has learnt on in advance much more than
will be done at second lesson.
But the old Madman hasn't, and gets called up and
makes some frightful shots, losing about ten places,
and all but getting floored. This somewhat appeases
Tom's wrath, and by the end of the lesson he has
regained his temper. And afterwards in their study

he begins to get right again, as he watches Arthur's
intense joy at seeing Martin blowing the eggs and
glueing them carefully on to bits of cardboard, and
notes the anxious loving looks which the little fellow
casts sidelong at him. And then he thinks, “ What
an ill-tempered beast I am! Here's just what I was
wishing for last night come about, and I'm spoiling
it all,” and in another five minutes has swallowed the
last mouthful of his bile, and is repaid by seeing his
little sensitive plant expand again, and sun itself in
his smiles.
After dinner the Madman is busy with the prepara-
tions for their expedition, fitting new straps on to
his climbing-irons, filling large pill-boxes with cotton-
wool, and sharpening East's small axe. They carry
all their munitions into calling-over, and directly
afterwards, having dodged such præpostors as are
on the look-out for fags at cricket, the four set off
at a smart trot down the Lawford footpath straight
for Caldecott's Spinney and the hawk's nest.
Martin leads the way in high feather; it is quite
a new sensation to him getting companions, and he
finds it very pleasant, and means to show them all
manner of proofs of his science and skill. Brown
and East may be better at cricket and football and
games, thinks he, but out in the fields and woods see
if I can't teach them something. He has taken the
leadership already, and strides away in front with his
climbing-irons strapped under one arm, his pecking-
bag under the other, and his pockets and hat full of
pill-boxes, cotton-wool, and other etceteras. Each of
the others carries a pecking-bag, and East his hatchet.
When they had crossed three or four fields without
a check, Arthur began to lag, and Tom seeing this
shouted to Martin to pull up a bit : “ We ain't out

hare-and-hounds—what's the good of grinding on
at this rate ?"
“ There's the spinney," said Martin, pulling up
on the brow of a slope at the bottom of which lay
Lawford brook, and pointing to the top of the opposite
slope ; “ the nest is in one of those high fir-trees at
this end. And down by the brook there, I know of a
sedge-bird's nest; we'll go and look at it coming
back."
“Oh, come on, don't let us stop,” said Arthur, who
was getting excited at the sight of the wood; so they
broke into a trot again, and were soon across the
brook, up the slope, and into the spinney. Here they
advanced as noiselessly as possible, lest keepers or
other enemies should be about, and stopped at the
foot of a tall fir, at the top of which Martin pointed
out with pride the kestrel's nest, the object of their
quest.
“Oh where! which is it ? ” asks Arthur, gaping
up in the air, and having the most vague idea of what
it would be like.
“ There, don't you see ? " said East, pointing to a
lump of mistletoe in the next tree, which was a
beech : he saw that Martin and Tom were busy with
the climbing-irons, and couldn't resist the temptation
of hoaxing. Arthur stared and wondered more than
ever.
“Well, how curious ! it doesn't look a bit like
what I expected,” said he.
“Very odd birds, kestrels,” said East, looking
waggishly at his victim, who was still star-gazing.
“But I thought it was in a fir-tree ? " objected
Arthur.
“Ah, don't you know ? that's a new sort of fir
which old Caldecott brought from the Himalayas.”


## p. 121 (#139) ############################################

THE BIRD-FANCIERS
121
“Really!” said Arthur ; “I'm glad I know that,
how unlike our firs they are. They do very well too
here, don't they ? the spinney's full of them.”
“What's that humbug he's telling you ?” cried
Tom, looking up, having caught the word Himalayas,
and suspecting what East was after.
“ Only about this fir,” said Arthur, putting his
hand on the stem of the beech.
“Fir!” shouted Tom, “ why you don't mean to
say, young un, you don't know a beech when you
see one ?”
Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, and
East exploded in laughter which made the wood
ring.
“I've hardly ever seen any trees," faltered
Arthur.
“What a shame to hoax him, Scud !” cried
Martin. “Never mind, Arthur, you shall know
more about trees than he does in a week or two.”
“And isn't that the kestrel's nest, then ?” asked
Arthur.
“That! why, that's a piece of mistletoe. There's
the nest, that lump of small sticks up this fir.”
“ Don't believe him, Arthur,” struck in the
incorrigible East ; “I just saw an old magpie go out
of it.”
Martin did not deign to reply to this sally, except
by a grunt, as he buckled the last buckle of his
climbing-irons; and Arthur looked reproachfully
at East without speaking.
But now came the tug of war. It was a very diffi-
cult tree to climb until the branches were reached, the
first of which was some fourteen feet up, for the trunk
was too large at the bottom to be swarmed ; in fact,
neither of the boys could reach more than half round

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
it with their arms. Martin and Tom, both of whom
had irons on, tried it without success at first; the
fir bark broke away where they stuck the irons in
as soon as they leant any weight on their feet, and the
grip of their arms wasn't enough to keep them up;
so after getting up three or four feet, down they came
slithering to the ground, barking their arms and
faces. They were furious, and East sat by laughing,
and shouting at each failure, “Two to one on the
old magpie !”
“We must try a pyramid,” said Tom at last.
“Now, Scud, you lazy rascal, stick yourself against
the tree !"
“I dare say! and have you standing on my
shoulders with the irons on: what do you think my
skin's made of ?” However, up he got, and leant
gainst the tree, putting his head down and clasping
it with his arms as far as he could. "Now then,
Madman,” said Tom, “ you next.”
“No, I'm lighter than you; you go next.” So
Tom got on East's shoulders and grasped the tree
above, and then Martin scrambled up on to Tom's
shoulders, amidst the totterings and groanings of
the pyramid, and with a spring which sent his sup-
porters howling to the ground, clasped the stem some
ten feet up, and remained clinging. For a moment
or two they thought he couldn't get up, but then,
holding on with arms and teeth, he worked first one
iron, then the other firmly into the bark, got another
grip with his arms, and in another minute had hold
of the lowest branch.
“ All up with the old magpie now," said East;
and after a minute's rest, up went Martin, hand over
hand, watched by Arthur with fearful eagerness.
“ Isn't it very dangerous ?” said he.

“Not a bit," answered Tom; “ you can't hurt
if you only get good hand-hold. Try every branch
with a good pull before you trust it, and then up
you go.”
Martin was now amongst the small branches close
to the nest, and away dashed the old bird and soared
up above the trees watching the intruder.
“All right-four eggs !” shouted he.
“Take 'em all ! ” shouted East; “that'll be one
apiece.”
“No, no! leave one, and then she won't care,”
said Tom.
We boys had an idea that birds couldn't count,
and were quite content as long as you left one egg.
I hope it is so.
Martin carefully put one egg into each of his
boxes and the third into his mouth, the only other
place of safety, and came down like a lamplighter.
All went well till he was within ten feet of the ground,
when, as the trunk enlarged, his hold got less and less
firm, and at last down he came with a run, tumbling
on to his back on the turf, spluttering and spitting
out the remains of the great egg, which had broken
by the jar of his fall.
“Ugh, ugh! something to drink-ugh! it was
addled," spluttered he, while the wood rang again
with the merry laughter of East and Tom.
Then they examined the prizes, gathered up their
things, and went off to the brook, where Martin
swallowed huge draughts of water to get rid of the
taste; and they visited the sedge-bird's nest, and
from thence struck across the country in high glee,
beating the hedges and brakes as they went along ;
and Arthur at last, to his intense delight, was allowed
to climb a small hedgerow oak for a magpie's nest

with Tom, who kept all round him like a mother, and
showed him where to hold and how to throw his
weight; and though he was in a great fright didn't
show it, and was applauded by all for his lissomness.
They crossed a road soon afterwards, and there
close to them lay a heap of charming pebbles.
“Look here,” shouted East, “here's luck! I've
been longing for some good honest pecking this
half-hour. Let's fill the bags, and have no more of this
foozling birds'-nesting.”
No one objected, so each boy filled the fustian bag
he carried full of stones; they crossed into the next
field, Tom and East taking one side of the hedges
and the other two the other side. Noise enough
they made certainly, but it was too early in the season
for the young birds, and the old birds were too strong
on the wing for our young marksmen, and flew out
of shot after the first discharge. But it was great
fun, rushing along the hedgerows and discharging
stone after stone at blackbirds and chaffinches,
though no result in the shape of slaughtered birds
was obtained; and Arthur soon entered into it, and
rushed to head back the birds, and shouted, and threw,
and tumbled into ditches and over and through
hedges, as wild as the Madman himself.
Presently the party, in full cry after an old black-
bird (who was evidently used to the thing and enjoyed
the fun, for he would wait till they came close to him
and then fly on for forty yards or so, and with an
impudent flicker of his tail dart into the depths of
the quickset), came beating down a high double
hedge, two on each side.
“There he is again,” “Head him," " Let drive,"
“ I had him there," " Take care where you're throw-
ing, Madman,” the shouts might have been heard a

quarter-of-a-mile off. They were heard some two
hundred yards off by a farmer and two of his shepherds,
who were doctoring sheep in a fold in the next field.
Now the farmer in question rented a house and
yard situate at the end of the field in which the
young bird-fanciers had arrived, which house and
yard he didn't occupy or keep any one else in. Never-
theless, like a brainless and unreasoning Briton, he
persisted in maintaining on the premises a large stock
of cocks, hens, and other poultry. Of course all
sorts of depredators visited the place from time to
time : foxes and gipsies wrought havoc in the night;
while in the daytime I regret to have to confess that
visits from the Rugby boys, and consequent dis-
appearances of ancient and respectable fowls, were not
unfrequent. Tom and East had during the period
of their outlawry visited the barn in question for
felonious purposes, and on one occasion had con-
quered and slain a duck there, and borne away the
carcase triumphantly, hidden in their handkerchiefs.
However, they were sickened of the practice by the
trouble and anxiety which the wretched duck's body
caused them. They carried it to Sally Harrowell's
in hopes of a good supper, but she, after examining
it, made a long face and refused to dress or have
anything to do with it. Then they took it into their
study, and began plucking it themselves; but what
to do with the feathers, where to hide them ?
“Good gracious, Tom, what a lot of feathers a
duck has !” groaned East, holding a bagful in his
hand, and looking disconsolately at the carcase not
yet half plucked.
“And I do think he's getting high too, already,"
said Tom, smelling at him cautiously, “So we must
finish him up soon."

“Yes, all very well, but how are we to cook him ?
I'm sure I ain't going to try it on in the hall or
passages; we can't afford to be roasting ducks about,
our character's too bad.”
“I wish we were rid of the brute," said Tom,
throwing him on the table in disgust. And after a
day or two more it became clear, that got rid of he
must be ; so they packed him and sealed him up in
brown paper, and put him in the cupboard of an un-
occupied study, where he was found in the holidays
by the matron, a grewsome body.
They had never been duck-hunting there since,
but others had, and the bold yeoman was very sore
on the subject, and bent on making an example of
the first boys he could catch. So he and his shepherds
crouched behind the hurdles, and watched the party
who were approaching all unconscious.
Why should that old guinea-fowl be lying out in
the hedge just at this particular moment of all the
year ? Who can say ? Guinea-fowls always are-
so are all other things, animals, and persons, requisite
for getting one into scrapes, always ready when any
mischief can come of them. At any rate, just under
East's nose popped out the old guinea-hen, scuttling
along and shrieking “come back, come back," at
the top of her voice. Either of the other three might
perhaps have withstood the temptation, but East
first lets drive the stone he has in his hand at her,
and then rushes to turn her into the hedge again.
He succeeds, and then they are all at it for dear life,
up and down the hedge in full cry, the “come back "
getting shriller and fainter every minute.
Meantime, the farmer and his men steal over the
hurdles and creep down the hedge towards the scene
of action. They are almost within a stone's throw of

Martin, who is pressing the unlucky chase hard, when
Tom catches sight of them and sings out, “ Louts,
'ware louts, your side! Madman, look ahead!"
and then catching hold of Arthur, hurries him away
across the field towards Rugby as hard as they can
tear. Had he been by himself he would have stayed
to see it out with the others, but now his heart sinks
and all his pluck goes. The idea of being led up to
the Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls, quite unmans
and takes half the run out of him.
However, no boys are more able to take care of
themselves than East and Martin; they dodge the
pursuers, slip through a gap, and come pelting after
Tom and Arthur, whom they catch up in no time;
the farmer and his men are making good running
about a field behind. Tom wishes to himself that
they had made off in any other direction, but now they
are all in for it together, and must see it out. “ You
won't leave the young un, will you ?” says he, as
they haul poor little Arthur, already losing wind from
the fright, through the next hedge. “Not we,"
is the answer from both. The next hedge is a stiff
one; the pursuers gain horribly on them, and they
only just pull Arthur through with two great rents
in his trousers, as the foremost shepherd comes up
on the other side. As they start into the next field
they are aware of two figures walking down the foot-
path in the middle of it, and recognize Holmes and
Diggs taking a constitutional. Those good-natured
fellows immediately shout “ On.” “Let's go to
them and surrender,” pants Tom.—Agreed.—And in
another minute the four boys, to the great astonish-
ment of those worthies, rush breathless up to Holmes
and Diggs, who pull up to see what is the matter, and
then the whole is explained by the appearance of

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
the farmer and his men, who unite their forces and
bear down on the knot of boys.
There is no time to explain, and Tom's heart
beats frightfully quick as he ponders, “ Will they
stand by us?”
The farmer makes a rush at East and collars him ;
and that young gentleman, with unusual discretion,
instead of kicking his shins looks appealingly at
Holmes, and stands still.
“Hullo there, not so fast," says Holmes, who is
bound to stand up for them till they are proved in
the wrong. “Now what's all this about ?”
“ I've got the young varmint at last, have I ?"
pants the farmer; “why, they've been a-skulking
about my yard and stealing my fowls, that's where
'tis; and if I doan't have they flogged for it, every
one on 'em, my name ain't Thompson."
Holmes looks grave, and Diggs' face falls. They
are quite ready to fight, no boys in the school more so ;
but they are præpostors, and understand their office,
and can't uphold unrighteous causes.
“I haven't been near his old barn this half,” cries
East. “Nor I,” “Nor I," chime in Tom and Martin.
“Now, Willum, didn't you see 'em there last
week ?”
“ Ees, I seen 'em sure enough,” says Willum,
grasping a prong he carried, and preparing for action.
The boys deny stoutly, and Willum is driven to
admit that, “if it worn’t they 'twas chaps as like
'em as two peas'n ;” and “ leastways he'll swear
he see'd them two in the yard last Martinmas,"
indicating East and Tom.
Holmes has had time to meditate. “Now, sir,"
says he to Willum, “ you see you can't remember
what you have seen, and I believe the boys."

“I doan't care," blusters the farmer ; “they was
arter my fowls to-day, that's enough for I. Willum,
you catch hold o' t'other chap. They've been
a-sneaking about this two hours, I tells 'ee,” shouted
he, as Holmes sta nds between Martin and Willum,
“and have druv a matter of a dozen young pullets
pretty nigh to death.”
“Oh, there's a whacker !” cried East; “we
haven't been within a hundred yards of his barn;
we haven't been up here above ten minutes, and we've
seen nothing but a tough old guinea-hen, who ran like
a greyhound.”
“Indeed that's all true, Holmes, upon my
honour,” added Tom; “ we weren't after his fowls ;
guinea-hen ran out of the hedge under our feet, and
we've seen nothing else.”
“ Drat that talk. Thee catch hold o' t'other,
Willum, and come along wi' un.”
“Farmer Thompson,” said Holmes, warning off
Willum and the prong with his stick, while Diggs
faced the other shepherd, cracking his fingers like
pistol shots, “now listen to reason—the boys haven't
been after your fowls, that's plain.”
“ Tells 'ee I seed 'em. Who be you, I should like
to know ?”
“Never you mind, Farmer," answered Holmes.
“And now I'll just tell you what it is—you ought to
be ashamed of yourself for leaving all that poultry
about with no one to watch it so near the School.
You deserve to have it all stolen. So if you choose
to come up to the Doctor with them, I shall go with
you and tell him what I think of it.”
The farmer began to take Holmes for a master ;
besides, he wanted to get back to his flock. Corporal
punishment was out of the question, the odds were

too great; so he began to hint at paying for the
damage. Arthur jumped at this, offering to pay
anything, and the farmer immediately valued the
guinea-hen at half-a-sovereign.
“Half-a-sovereign ! ” cried East, now released
from the farmer's grip; “well, that is a good one !
the old hen ain't hurt a bit, and she's seven years
old, I know, and as tough as whipcord ; she couldn't
lay another egg to save her life.”
It was at last settled that they should pay the
farmer two shillings, and his man one shilling, and
so the matter ended, to the unspeakable relief of Tom,
who hadn't been able to say a word, being sick at
heart at the idea of what the Doctor would think of
him: and now the whole party of boys marched off
down the footpath towards Rugby. Holmes, who
was one of the best boys in the School, began to
improve the occasion. “Now, you youngsters,”
said he, as he marched along in the middle of them,
“mind this, you're very well out of this scrape. Don't
you go near Thompson's barn again, do you hear ? ”
Profuse promises from all, especially East.
“Mind, I don't ask questions," went on Mentor,
" but I rather think some of you have been there
before this after his chickens. Now, knocking over
other people's chickens and running off with them
is stealing. It's a nasty word, but that's the plain
English of it. If the chickens were dead and lying
in a shop you wouldn't take them, I know that, any
more than you would apples out of Griffith's basket;
but there's no real difference between chickens running
about and apples on a tree, and the same articles
in a shop. I wish our morals were sounder in such
matters. There's nothing so mischievous as these
school distinctions, which jumble up right and wrong:

and justify things in us for which poor boys would be
sent to prison.” And good old Holmes delivered his
soul on the walk home of many wise sayings, and, as
the song says-
“Geo'd 'em a sight of good advice,"
which same sermon sank into them all more or less,
and very penitent they were for several hours.
Martin became a constant inmate in the joint
study from this time, and Arthur took to him so
kindly that Tom couldn't resist slight fits of jealousy,
which however he managed to keep to himself. The
kestrel's eggs had not been broken, strange to say,
and formed the nucleus of Arthur's collection, at
which Martin worked heart and soul; and intro-
duced Arthur to Howlett the bird-fancier, and
instructed him in the rudiments of the art of stuffing.
In token of his gratitude, Arthur allowed Martin to
tattoo a small anchor on one of his wrists, which
decoration, however, he carefully concealed from Tom.
Before the end of the half-year he had trained into
a bold climber and good runner, and, as Martin had
foretold, knew twice as much about trees, birds,
flowers, and many other things, as our good-hearted
and facetious young friend Harry East.
CHAPTER XI
THE FIGHT
As East had said, the regular master of the form was
unwell, and they were to be heard by one of the new
masters, quite a young man, who had only just left
the University.

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Now the clock strikes the three-quarters; there is
only a quarter-of-an-hour more; but the forty lines
are all but done. So the boys, one after another, who
are called up, stick more and more, and make balder
and ever more bald work of it. The poor young
master is pretty near beat by this time, and feels
ready to knock his head against the wall, or his
fingers against somebody else's head. So he gives
up altogether the lower and middle parts of the form
and looks round in despair at the boys on the top
bench, to see if there is one out of whom he can strike
a spark or two, and who will be too chivalrous to
murder the most beautiful utterances of the most
beautiful woman of the old world. His eye rests on
Arthur, and he calls him up to finish construing
Helen's speech. Whereupon all the other boys draw
long breaths, and begin to stare about and take it
easy. They are all safe; Arthur is the head of the
form and sure to be able to construe, and that will
tide on safely till the hour strikes.
Arthur proceeds to read out the passage in Greek
before construing it, as the custom is. Tom, who
isn't paying much attention, is suddenly caught by
the falter in his voice as he reads. He looks up at
Arthur. “Why, bless us," thinks he, “what can
be the matter with the young un? He's never going
to get floored. He's sure to have learnt to the end."
Next moment he is reassured by the spirited tone
in which Arthur begins construing, and betakes
himself to drawing dog's heads in his note-book,
while the master, evidently enjoying the change,
turns his back on the middle bench and stands before
Arthur, beating a sort of time with his hand and foot,
and saying, “ Yes, yes,” “very well,” as Arthur
goes on.


## p. 133 (#151) ############################################

Suddenly at this point Arthur breaks down
altogether, and fairly bursts out crying, and dashes
the cuff of his jacket across his eyes, blushing up to
the roots of his hair, and feeling as if he should like
to go down suddenly through the floor. The whole
form are taken aback; most of them stare stupidly
at him, while those who are gifted with presence of
mind find their places and look steadily at their books
in hopes of not catching the master's eye and getting
called up in Arthur's place.
The master looks puzzled for a moment, and then
seeing, as the fact is, that the boy is really affected to
tears by the most touching thing in Homer, perhaps
in all profane poetry put together, steps up to him
and lays his hand kindly on his shoulder, saying,
“Never mind, my little man, you've construed very
well. Stop a minute, there's no hurry."
Now, as luck would have it, there sat next above
Tom on that day, in the middle bench of the form,
a big boy, by name Williams, generally supposed to
be the cock of the shell, therefore of all the school
below the fifths. The small boys, who are great
speculators on the prowess of their elders, used to hold
forth to one another about Williams's great strength,
and to discuss whether East or Brown would take a
licking from him. He was called Slogger Williams,
from the force with which it was supposed he could
hit. In the main he was a rough good-natured
fellow enough, but very much alive to his own dignity.
He reckoned himself the king of the form, and kept
up his position with the strong hand, especially in
the matter of forcing boys not to construe more
than the legitimate forty lines. He had already
grunted and grumbled to himself when Arthur went
on reading beyond the forty lines. But now that he

had broken down just in the middle of all the long
words, the Slogger's wrath was fairly aroused.
“Sneaking little brute," muttered he, regardless
of prudence, “ clapping on the waterworks just in the
hardest place; see if I don't punch his head after
fourth lesson.”
“Whose ?” said Tom, to whom the remark
seemed to be addressed.
“Why, that little sneak Arthur's,” replied
Williams.
“No, you sha’n’t,” said Tom.
“Hullo !” exclaimed Williams, looking at Tom
with great surprise for a moment, and then giving
him a sudden dig in the ribs with his elbow, which
sent Tom's books flying on to the floor, and called the
attention of the master, who turned suddenly round,
and seeing the state of things said-
“Williams, go down three places, and then go
on.”
The Slogger found his legs very slowly, and
proceeded to go below Tom and two other boys with
great disgust, and then, turning round and facing
the master, said: “I haven't learnt any more, sir ;
our lesson is only forty lines.”
“Is that so ?” said the master, appealing generally
to the top bench. No answer.
“Who is the head boy of the form ?” said he,
waxing wroth.
“Arthur, sir,” answered three or four boys,
indicating our friend.
“Oh, your name's Arthur. Well now, what is
the length of your regular lesson ?"
Arthur hesitated a moment, and then said, “We
call it only forty lines, sir."
“How do you mean, you call it ?"


## p. 135 (#153) ############################################

THE FIGHT
135
“Well, sir, Mr. Graham says we ain't to stop
there, when there's time to construe more.”
“I understand,” said the master. “Williams, go
down three more places, and write me out the lesson
in Greek and English. And now, Arthur, finish
construing."
“Oh! would I be in Arthur's shoes after fourth
lesson,” said the little boys to one another; but
Arthur finished Helen's speech without any further
catastrophe, and the clock struck four, which ended
third lesson.
Another hour was occupied in preparing and saying
fourth lesson, during which Williams was bottling
up his wrath; and when five struck, and the lessons
for the day were over, he prepared to take summary
vengeance on the innocent cause of his misfortune.
Tom was detained in school a few minutes after
the rest, and on coming out into the quadrangle, the
first thing he saw was a small ring of boys, applauding
Williams, who was holding Arthur by the collar.
“ There, you young sneak,” said he, giving Arthur
a cuff on the head with his other hand, “ what made
you say that,"
“Hullo !” said Tom, shouldering into the crowd,
“you drop that, Williams; you sha'n't touch him."
“Who'll stop me ? ” said the Slogger, raising his
hand again.
“I," said Tom; and suiting the action to the
word, struck the arm which held Arthur's arm so
sharply that the Slogger dropped it with a start, and
turned the full current of his wrath on Tom.
“Will you fight?"
“ Yes, of course.”
“ Huzza, there's going to be a fight between
Slogger Williams and Tom Brown.”


## p. 136 (#154) ############################################

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
The news ran like wild-fire about, and many boys
who were on their way to tea at their several houses
turned back, and sought the back of the chapel,
where the fights come off.
“Just run and tell East to come and back me,”
said Tom to a small School-house boy, who was off
like a rocket to Harrowell's, just stopping for a moment
to poke his head into the School-house hall, where the
lower boys were already at tea, and sing out, “ Fight !
Tom Brown and Slogger Williams.”
Up start half the boys at once, leaving bread,
eggs, butter, sprats, and all the rest to take care of
themselves. The greater part of the remainder follow
in a minute, after swallowing their tea, carrying their
food in their hands to consume as they go. Three
or four only remain, who steal the butter of the more
impetuous, and make to themselves an unctuous feast.
In another minute East and Martin tear through
the quadrangle, carrying a sponge, and arrive at the
scene of action just as the combatants are beginning
to strip.
Tom felt he had got his work cut out for him, as
he stripped off his jacket, waistcoat, and braces.
East tied his handkerchief round his waist, and rolled
up his shirt-sleeves for him: “Now, old boy, don't
you open your mouth to say a word, or try to help
yourself a bit, we'll do all that; you keep all your
breath and strength for the Slogger.” Martin mean-
while folded the clothes, and put them under the
chapel rails; and now Tom, with East to handle him
and Martin to give him a knee, steps out on the turf,
and is ready for all that may come: and here is the
Slogger too, all stripped, and thirsting for the fray.
It doesn't look a fair match at first glance :
Williams is nearly two inches taller, and probably

a long year older than his opponent, and he is very
strongly made about the arms and shoulders ; " peels
well," as the little knot of big fifth-form boys, the
amateurs, say; who, stand outside the ring of little
boys, looking complacently on, but taking no active
part in the proceedings. But down below he is not so
good by any means; no spring from the loins, and
feeblish, not to say shipwrecky, about the knees.
Tom, on the contrary, though not half so strong in
the arms, is good all over, straight, hard, and springy,
from neck to ankle, better perhaps in his legs than
anywhere. Besides, you can see by the clear white
of his eye and fresh bright look of his skin, that he is
in tiptop training, able to do all he knows; while
the Slogger looks rather sodden, as if he didn't take
much exercise and ate too much tuck. The time-
keeper is chosen, a large ring made, and the two stand
opposite one another for a moment, giving us time just
to make our little observations.
“If Tom'll only condescend to fight with his head
and heels," as East mutters to Martin,“ we shall do.”
But seemingly he won't, for there he goes in,
making play with both hands. Hard all, is the word ;
the two stand to one another like men ; rally follows
rally in quick succession, each fighting as if he thought
to finish the whole thing out of hand. “ Can't last
at this rate,” say the knowing ones, while the partisans
of each make the air ring with their shouts and counter-
shouts of encouragement, approval, and defiance.
“Take it easy, take it easy-keep away, let him
come after you,” implores East, as he wipes Tom's
face after the first round with wet sponge, while he
sits back on Martin's knee, supported by the Madman's
long arms, which tremble a little from excitement.
“ Time's up,” calls the timekeeper.

“ There he goes again, hang it all !” growls East,
as his man is at it again as hard as ever. A very
severe round follows, in which Tom gets out-and-out
the worst of it, and is at last hit clean off his legs, and
deposited on the grass by a right-hander from the
Slogger.
Loud shouts rise from the boys of Slogger's house,
and the School-house are silent and vicious, ready to
pick quarrels anywhere.
“Two to one in half-crowns on the big un,” says
Rattle, one of the amateurs, a tall fellow, in thunder-
and-lightning waistcoat, and puffy good-natured face.
“ Done!” says Groove, another amateur of quieter
look, taking out his note-book to enter it, for our
friend Rattle sometimes forgets these little things.
Meantime East is freshening up Tom with the
sponges for next round, and has set two other boys
to rub his hands.
“ Tom, old boy," whispers he, “this may be fun
for you, but it's death to me. He'll hit all the fight
out of you in another five minutes, and then I shall
go and drown myself in the island ditch. Feint him,
use your legs ! draw him about! he'll lose his wind
then in no time, and you can go into him. Hit at his
body too: we'll take care of his frontispiece by and by.”
Tom felt the wisdom of the counsel, and saw
already that he couldn't go in and finish the Slogger
off at mere hammer and tongs, so changed his tactics
completely in the third round. He now fights
cautious, getting away from and parrying the Slogger's
lunging hits instead of trying to counter, and leading
his enemy a dance all round the ring after him.
“ He's funking; go in, Williams," “ Catch him up,"
“ Finish him off,” scream the small boys of the
Slogger party.

“ Just what we want,” thinks East, chuckling to
himself, as he sees Williams, excited by these shouts,
and thinking the game in his own hands, blowing
himself in his exertions to get to close quarters again,
while Tom is keeping away with perfect ease.
They quarter over the ground again and again,
Tom always on the defensive.
The Slogger pulls up at last for a moment, fairly
blown.
“Now then, Tom," sings out East, dancing with
delight. Tom goes in in a twinkling, and hits two
heavy body blows, and gets away again before the
Slogger can catch his wind; which when he does he
rushes with blind fury at Tom, and being skilfully
parried and avoided, overreaches himself and falls
on his face, amidst terrific cheers from the School-
house boys.
“Double your two to one ?” says Groove to
Rattle, note-book in hand.
“ Stop a bit,” says that hero, looking uncomfort-
ably at Williams, who is puffing away on his second's
knee, winded enough, but little the worse in any
other way.
After another round the Slogger too seems to see
that he can't go in and win right off, and has met his
match or thereabouts. So he too begins to use his
head, and tries to make Tom lose patience, and come
in before his time. And so the fight sways on, now
one and now the other getting a trifling pull.
Tom's face begins to look very one-sided—there
are little queer bumps on his forehead, and his mouth
is bleeding ; but East keeps the wet sponge going so
scientifically, that he comes up looking as fresh and
bright as ever. Williams is only slightly marked in
the face, but by the nervous movement of his elbows

you can see that Tom's body blows are telling. In
fact half the vice of the Slogger's hitting is neutralized,
for he daren't lunge out freely for fear of exposing his
sides. It is too interesting by this time for much
shouting, and the whole ring is very quiet.
“ All right, Tommy," whispers East; “hold on's
the horse that's to win. We've got the last. Keep
your head, old boy."
But where is Arthur all this time? Words
cannot paint the poor little fellow's distress. He
couldn't muster courage to come up to the ring, but
wandered up and down from the great fives-court
to the corner of the chapel rails, now trying to make
up his mind to throw himself between them, and
try to stop them; then thinking of running in and
telling his friend Mary, who he knew would instantly
report to the Doctor. The stories he had heard of
men being killed in prize-fights rose up horribly
before him.
Once only, when the shouts of “Well done,
Brown !” “Huzza for the School-house!” rose
higher than ever, he ventured up to the ring, thinking
the victory was won. Catching sight of Tom's face
in the state I have described, all fear of consequences
vanishing out of his mind, he rushed straight off to
the matron's room, beseeching her to get the fight
stopped, or he should die.
But it's time for us to get back to the close.
What is this fierce tumult and confusion ? The ring
is broken, and high and angry words are being
bandied about; “It's all fair,” “ It isn't,” “No
hugging : " the fight is stopped. The combatants,
however, sit there quietly, tended by their seconds,
while their adherents wrangle in the middle East
can't help shouting challenges to two or three of the

other side, though he never leaves Tom for a moment,
and plies the sponges as fast as ever.
The fact is, that at the end of the last round, Tom
seeing a good opening had closed with his opponent,
and after a moment's struggle had thrown him
heavily, by help of the fall he had learnt from his
village rival in the Vale of White Horse. Williams
hadn't the ghost of a chance with Tom at wrestling ;
and the conviction broke at once on the Slogger
faction, that if this were allowed their man must be
licked. There was a strong feeling in the school
against catching hold and throwing, though it was
generally ruled all fair within certain limits; so the
ring was broken and the fight stopped.
The School-house are overruled—the fight is on
again, but there is to be no throwing ; and East in
high wrath threatens to take his man away after
next round (which he don't mean to do, by the way),
when suddenly young Brooke comes through the small
gate at the end of the chapel. The School-house
faction rush to him. “Oh, hurra! now we shall get
fair play.”
“Please, Brooke, come up, they won't let Tom
Brown throw him.”
“ Throw whom ?” says Brooke, coming up to the
ring. “Oh, Williams, I see. Nonsense ! of course he
may throw him if he catches fairly above the waist.”
Now, young Brooke, you're in the sixth, you know,
and you ought to stop all fights. He looks hard at
both boys. “Anything wrong ? ” says he to East,
nodding to Tom.
“Not a bit.”
“Not beat at all ?”
“Bless you, no! Heaps of fight in him. Ain't
there, Tom ?"


## p. 142 (#160) ############################################

142
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Tom looks at Brooke and grins.
“How's he ?” nodding at Williams.
“So, so; rather done, I think, since his last fall.
He won't stand above two more.”
“ Time's up!" the boys rise again and face one
another. Brooke can't find it in his heart to stop
them just yet, so the round goes on, the Slogger
waiting for Tom, and reserving all his strength to
hit him out should he come in for the wrestling dodge
again, for he feels that that must be stopped, or his
sponge will soon go up in the air.
And now another new-comer appears on the field,
to wit, the under-porter, with his long brush and great
wooden receptacle for dust under his arm. He has
been sweeping out the schools.
“You'd better stop, gentlemen,” he says; “the
Doctor knows that Brown's fighting—he'll be out in a
minute.”
“You go to Bath, Bill,” is all that excellent
servitor gets by his advice. And being a man of his
hands, and a staunch upholder of the School-house,
can't help stopping to look on for a bit, and see Tom
Brown, their pet craftsman, fight a round.
It is grim earnest, and no mistake. Both boys
feel this, and summon every power of head, hand,
and eye to their aid. A piece of luck on either side,
a foot slipping, a blow getting well home, or another
fall, may decide it. Tom works slowly round for an
opening, he has all the legs, and can choose his own
time; the Slogger waits for the attack and hopes to
finish it by some heavy right-handed blow. As they
quarter slowly over the ground, the evening sun
comes out from behind a cloud and falls full on
Williams' face. Tom darts in, the heavy right-hand
is delivered, but only grazes his head. A short rally

at close quarters, and they close ; in another moment
the Slogger is thrown again heavily for the third time.
“I'll give you three to two on the little one in
half-crowns,” says Groove to Rattle.
“No, thank’ee,” answers the other, diving his
hands further into his coat-tails.
Just at this stage of the proceedings, the door of
the turret which leads to the Doctor's library suddenly
opens, and he steps into the close, and makes straight
for the ring, in which Brown and the Slogger are both
seated on their seconds' knees for the last time.
“The Doctor ! the Doctor !” shouts some small
boy who catches sight of him, and the ring melts
away in a few seconds, the small boys tearing off,
Tom collaring his jacket and waistcoat, and slipping
through the little gate by the chapel, and round the
corner to Harrowell's with his backers, as lively as
need be; Williams and his backers making off not
quite so fast across the close, Groove, Rattle, and
the other bigger fellows trying to combine dignity and
prudence in a comical manner, and walking off fast
enough, they hope, not to be recognized, and not fast
enough to look like running away.
Young Brooke alone remains on the ground by
the time the Doctor gets there, and touches his hat,
not without a slight inward qualm.
“Hah! Brooke. I am surprised to see you here.
Don't you know that I expect the sixth to stop
fighting ?”
Brooke felt much more uncomfortable than he
had expected, but he was rather a favourite with the
Doctor for his openness and plainness of speech; so
blurted out, as he walked by the Doctor's side, who
had already turned back-
“Yes, sir, generally. But I thought you wished


## p. 144 (#162) ############################################

144
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
us to exercise a discretion in the matter too—not to
interfere too soon.”
“But they have been fighting this half-hour and
more,” said the Doctor.
“Yes, sir ; but neither was hurt. And they're
the sort of boys who'll be all the better friends now,
which they wouldn't have been if they had been
stopped any earlier-before it was so equal."
“ Who was fighting with Brown ?" said the
Doctor.
“ Williams, sir, of Thompson's. He is bigger
than Brown, and had the best of it at first, but not
when you came up, sir. There's a good deal of
jealousy between our house and Thompson's, and
there would have been more fights if this hadn't been
let go on, or if either of them had had much the
worst of it.”
“ Wellbut, Brooke," said the Doctor, “ doesn't
this look a little as if you exercised your discretion
by only stopping a fight when the School-house boy
is getting the worst of it ?”
Brooke, it must be confessed, felt rather gravelled.
“Now, remember," added the Doctor, as he
stopped at the turret-door, “ this fight is not to go
on-you'll see to that. And I expect you to stop
all fights in future at once."
“ Very well, sir," said young Brooke, touching his
hat, and not sorry to see the turret-door close behind
the Doctor's back.
Meantime Tom and the staunchest of his adherents
had reached Harrowell's, and Sally was bustling
about to get them a late tea, while Stumps had been
sent off to Tew the butcher, to get a piece of raw beef
for Tom's eye, which was to be healed off-hand so
that he might show well in the morning. He was

not a bit the worse except a slight difficulty in his
vision, a singing in his ears, and a sprained thumb,
which he kept in a cold-water bandage, while he
drank lots of tea, and listened to the Babel of voices
talking and speculating of nothing but the fight, and
how Williams would have given in after another fall
(which he didn't in the least believe), and how on
earth the Doctor could have got to know of it, such
bad luck! He couldn't help thinking to himself
that he was glad he hadn't won; he liked it better
as it was, and felt very friendly to the Slogger. And
then poor little Arthur crept in and sat down quietly
near him, and kept looking at him and the raw beef
with such plaintive looks, that Tom at last burst out
laughing.
“Don't make such eyes, young un,” said he,
" there's nothing the matter."
“Oh, but, Tom, are you much hurt? I can't
bear thinking it was all for me."
“Not a bit of it, don't flatter yourself. We were
sure to have had it out sooner or later."
“Well, but you won't go on, will you? You'll
promise me you won't go on?”
“ Can't tell about that—all depends on the
houses. We're in the hands of our countrymen, you
know. Must fight for the School-house flag, if so be."
However, the lovers of the science were doomed to
disappointment this time. Directly after locking-up,
one of the night fags knocked at Tom's door.
“Brown, young Brooke wants you in the sixth-
form room.”
Up went Tom to the summons, and found the
magnates sitting at their supper.
“Well, Brown," said young Brooke, nodding to
him, “how do you feel ?”


## p. 146 (#164) ############################################

146
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“Oh, very well, thank you, only I've sprained
my thumb, I think.”
“Sure to do that in a fight. Well, you hadn't the
worst of it, I could see. Where did you learn that
throw ?”
“ Down in the country, when I was a boy."
“Hullo! why, what are you now? Well, never
mind, you're a plucky fellow. Sit down and have
some supper.”
Tom obeyed, by no means loth. And the fifth-
form boy next him filled him a tumbler of bottled
beer, and he ate and drank, listening to the
pleasant talk, and wondering how soon he should
be in the fifth, and one of that much-envied
society.
As he got up to leave, Brooke said, “ You must
shake hands to-morrow morning; I shall come and
see that done after first lesson.”
And so he did. And Tom and the Slogger shook
hands with great satisfaction and mutual respect.
And for the next year or two, whenever fights were
being talked of, the small boys who had been present
shook their heads wisely, saying, “ Ah! but you
should just have seen the fight between Slogger
Williams and Tom Brown!”
As to fighting, keep out of it if you can, by all
means. When the time comes, if it ever should,
that you have to say “ Yes” or “No” to a challenge
to fight, say “No” if you can,-only take care you
make it clear to yourselves why you say “No."
It's a proof of the highest courage, if done from true
Christian motives. It's quite right and justifiable,
if done from a simple aversion to physical pain and
danger. But don't say “No” because you fear a
licking, and say or think it's because you fear God,

for that's neither Christian nor honest. And if you
do fight, fight it out; and don't give in while you can
stand and see.
CHAPTER XII
FEVER IN THE SCHOOL
Two years have passed since the events recorded in
the last chapter, and the end of the summer half-year
is again drawing on. Martin has left and gone on a
cruise in the South Pacific, in one of his uncle's ships;
the old magpie, as disreputable as ever, his last
bequest to Arthur, lives in the joint study. Arthur
is nearly sixteen, and at the head of the twenty,
having gone up the school at the rate of a form a
half-year East and Tom have been much more
deliberate in their progress, and are only a little
way up the fifth form. Great strapping boys they
are, but still thorough boys, filling about the same
place in the house that young Brooke filled when they
were new boys, and much the same sort of fellows.
Constant intercourse with Arthur has done much for
both of them, especially for Tom; but much remains
yet to be done, if they are to get all the good out of
Rugby which is to be got there in these times.
Arthur is still frail and delicate, with more spirit than
body; but, thanks to his intimacy with them and
Martin, has learned to swim, and run, and play
cricket, and has never hurt himself by too much
reading.
One evening, as they were all sitting down to
supper in the fifth-form room, some one started a

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
report that a fever had broken out at one of the
boarding-houses; "they say,” he added, “that
Thompson is very ill, and that Dr. Robertson has
been sent for from Northampton.”
“Then we shall all be sent home," cried another.
“Hurrah ! five weeks' extra holidays, and no fifth-
form examination ! ” .
“I hope not,” said Tom; “there'll be no Maryle-
bone match then at the end of the half."
Some thought one thing, some another, many
didn't believe the report; but the next day, Tuesday,
Dr. Robertson arrived, and stayed all day, and had
long conferences with the Doctor.
On Wednesday morning after prayers, the Doctor
addressed the whole School. There were several
cases of ferer in different houses, he said; but
Dr. Robertson, after the most careful examination,
had assured him that it was not infectious, and that
if proper care were taken, there could be no reason
for stopping the school work at present. The
examinations were just coming on, and it would be
very unadvisable to break up now. However, any
bors who chose to do so were at liberty to write home,
and, if their parents wished it, to leave at once. He
should send the whole School home if the fever spread.
The next day Arthur sickened, but there was no
other case. Before the end of the week thirty or
forty bors had gone, but the rest stayed on. There
was a general wish to please the Doctor, and a feeling
that it was cowardly to run away.
The wek passed mournfully awar. No more boys
sickened, but Arthur was reported worse each day,
and his mother arrived early in the next week. Tom
made many sppeals to be showed to see him, and
sereral times tried to get up to the sick-room; but

149
the house-keeper was always in the way, and at last
spoke to the Doctor, who kindly, but peremptorily
forbade him.
All this time Thompson grew worse, and died on
the Saturday. He was buried on the Tuesday, and
the burial service, so soothing and grand always, but
beyond all words solemn when read over a boy's
grave to his companions, brought him much comfort,
and many strange new thoughts and longings. He
went back to his regular life, and played cricket and
bathed as usual; it seemed to him that this was the
right thing to do, and the new thoughts and longings
became more brave and healthy for the effort. The
crisis came on Saturday, the day week that Thompson
had died; and during that long afternoon Tom sat
in his study reading his Bible, and going every half-
hour to the housekeeper's room, expecting each time
to hear that the gentle and brave little spirit had gone
home. But God had work for Arthur to do; the
crisis passed-on Sunday evening he was declared
out of danger; on Monday he sent a message to
Tom that he was almost well, had changed his room,
and was to be allowed to see him the next day.
It was the evening when the housekeeper sum-
moned him to the sick-room. Arthur was lying on
the sofa by the open window, through which the
rays of the western sun stole gently, lighting up his
white face and golden hair. Tom remembered a
German picture of an angel which he knew ; often
had he thought how transparent and golden and
spirit-like it was; and he shuddered to think how like
it Arthur looked, and felt a shock as if his blood had
all stopped short, as he realized how near the other
world his friend must have been to look like that.
Never till that moment had he felt how his little chum

150
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
had twined himself round his heart-strings; and as
he stole gently across the room and knelt down, and
put his arm round Arthur's head on the pillow, felt
ashamed and half angry at his own red and brown
face, and the bounding sense of health and power
which filled every fibre of his body, and made every
moment of mere living a joy to him. He needn't
have troubled himself; it was this very strength and
power so different from his own which drew Arthur so
to him.
Arthur laid his thin white hand, on which the blue
veins stood out so plainly, on Tom's great brown fist,
and smiled at him; and then looked out of the window
again, as if he couldn't bear to lose a moment of the
sunset, into the tops of the great feathery elms,
round which the rooks were circling and clanging,
returned in flocks from their evening's foraging
parties. The elms rustled, the sparrows in the ivy
just outside the window chirped and fluttered about,
quarrelling and making it up again; the rooks young
and old talked in chorus, and the merry shouts of the
boys, and the sweet clink of the cricket-bats, came up
cheerily from below.
“Dear George," said Tom, “I am so glad to be
let up to see you at last. “ I've tried hard to come
up so often, but they wouldn't let me before.”
“Oh, I know, Tom; Mary has told me every
day about you, and how she was obliged to make the
Doctor speak to you to keep you away. I'm very
glad you didn't get up, for you might have caught it,
and you couldn't stand being ill, with all the matches
going on. And you're in the eleven too, I hear—I'm
so glad.”
“Yes, ain't it jolly ?” said Tom proudly ; “ I'm
ninth too. I made forty in the last pie-match, and

caught three fellows out. So I was put in above
Jones and Tucker. Tucker's so savage, for he was
head of the twenty-two."
“Well, I think you ought to be higher yet," said
Arthur, who was as jealous for the renown of Tom in
games, as Tom was for his as a scholar.
“Never mind, I don't care about cricket or any-
thing now you're getting well, Geordie; and I
shouldn't have hurt, I know, if they'd have let me
come up,—nothing hurts me. But you'll get about
now directly, won't you? You won't believe how
clean I've kept the study. All your things are just
as you left them; and I feed the old magpie just
when you ușed, though I have to come in from
big-side for him, the old rip. He won't look pleased
all I can do, and sticks his head first on one side and
then on the other, and blinks at me before he'll begin
to eat, till I'm half inclined to box his ears. And when-
ever East comes in, you should see him hop off to
the window, dot and go one, though Harry wouldn't
touch a feather of him now.”
Arthur laughed. “ Old Gravey has a good
memory; he can't forget the sieges of poor Martin's
den in old times.” He paused a moment, and then
went on: “ You can't think how often I've been
thinking of old Martin since I've been ill; I suppose
one's mind gets restless, and likes to wander off to
strange unknown places. I wonder what queer new
pets the old boy has got; how he must be revelling
in the thousand new birds, beasts, and fishes.”
Tom felt a pang of jealousy, but kicked it out in a
moment. “Fancy him on a South-sea island, with
the Cherokees or Patagonians, or some such wild
niggers” (Tom's ethnology and geography were
faulty, but sufficient for his needs); “they'll make the

old Madman cock medicine-man and tattoo him
all over. Perhaps he's cutting about now all blue,
and has a squaw and a wigwam. He'll improve
their boomerangs, and be able to throw them too,
without having old Thomas sent after him by the
Doctor to take them away."
Arthur laughed at the remembrance of the
boomerang story, but then looked grave again, and
said, “ He'll convert all the island, I know."
“Yes, if he don't blow it up first."
“Do you remember, Tom, how you and East
used to laugh at him and chaff him, because he said he
was sure the rooks all had calling-over, or prayers,
or something of the sort, when the locking-up bell
rang? Well, I declare,” said Arthur, looking up
seriously into Tom's laughing eyes, “I do think he
was right. Since I've been lying here, I've watched
them every night; and do you know, they really
do come and perch, all of them, just about locking-up
time; and then first there's a regular chorus of caws,
and then they stop a bit, and one old fellow, or perhaps
two or three in different trees, caw solos, and then
off they all go again, fluttering about and cawing
anyhow till they roost.”
“I wonder if the old blackies do talk," said Tom,
looking up at them. “How they must abuse me
and East, and pray for the Doctor for stopping the
slinging.”
“ There! look, look !” cried Arthur, “don't
you see the old fellow without a tail coming up ?
Martin used to call him the clerk.' He can't steer
himself. You never saw such fun as he is in a high
wind, when he can't steer himself home, and gets
carried right past the trees, and has to bear up again
and again before he can perch.”

153
The locking-up bell began to toll, and the two
boys were silent and listened to it. The sound soon
carried Tom off to the river and the woods, and he
began to go over in his mind the many occasions on
which he had heard that toll coming faintly down the
breeze, and had to pack up his rod in a hurry and
make a run for it, to get in before the gates were shut.
In another minute nine o'clock struck, and a
gentle tap at the door called them both back into the
world again. They did not answer, however, for a
moment, and so the door opened and a lady came in
carrying a candle.
She went straight to the sofa, and took hold of
Arthur's hand, and then stooped down and kissed him.
“My dearest boy, you feel a little feverish again.
Why didn't you have lights? You've talked too
much, and excited yourself in the dark.”
“Oh no, mother, you can't think how well I feel.
I shall start with you to-morrow for Devonshire.
But, mother, here's my friend, here's Tom Brown-
you know him ?”
“Yes, indeed, I've known him for years," she
said, and held out her hand to Tom, who was now
standing up behind the sofa. This was Arthur's
mother : tall and slight and fair, with masses of
golden hair drawn back from the broad white fore-
head, and the calm blue eye meeting his so deep and
open—the eye that he knew so well, for it was his
friend's over again, and the lovely tender mouth that
trembled while he looked. She stood there a woman
of thirty-eight, old enough to be his mother, and one
whose face showed the lines which must be written
on the faces of good men's wives and widows—but he
thought he had never seen anything so beautiful. He
couldn't help wondering if Arthur's sisters were like her.


## p. 154 (#172) ############################################

154
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Tom held her hand, and looked on straight in
her face ; he could neither let it go nor speak.
“Now, Tom,” said Arthur, laughing, “where
are your manners ? you'll stare my mother out of
countenance." Tom dropped the little hand with a
sigh. “There, sit down, both of you. Here, dearest
mother, there's room here,” and he made a place on
the sofa for her. “ Tom, you needn't go; I'm sure
you won't be called up at first lesson.” Tom felt
that he would risk being floored at every lesson for
the rest of his natural school-life sooner than go;
so sat down. “And now," said Arthur, “I have
realized one of the dearest wishes of my life—to see
you two together.” .
And then he led away the talk to their home in
Devonshire, and the red bright earth, and the deep
green combes, and the peat streams like cairngorm
pebbles, and the wild moor with its high cloudy Tors
for a giant background to the picture—till Tom got
jealous, and stood up for the clear chalk streams, and
the emerald water meadows and great elms and
willows of the dear old Royal county, as he gloried
to call it. And the mother sat on quiet and loving,
rejoicing in their life. The quarter-to-ten struck, and
the bell rang for bed, before they had well begun their
talk as it seemed.
Then Tom rose with a sigh to go.
“ Shall I see you in the morning, Geordie ?” said
he, as he shook his friend's hand. “Never mind
though; you'll be back next half, and I shan't
forget the house of Rimmon.”
Arthur's mother got up and walked with him to
the door, and there gave him her hand again, and again
his eyes met that deep loving look, which was like a
spell upon him. Her voice trembled slightly as she

TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH
said, “Good-night-you are one who knows what
our Father has promised to the friend of the widow
and the fatherless. May He deal with you as you
have dealt with me and mine!”
Tom was quite upset; he mumbled something
about owing everything good in him to Geordie-
looked in her face again, pressed her hand to his lips,
and rushed downstairs to his study, where he sat till
old Thomas came kicking at the door, to tell him his
allowance would be stopped if he didn't go off to bed.
(It would have been stopped anyhow, but that he was
a great favourite with the old gentleman, who loved
to come out in the afternoons into the close to Tom's
wicket, and bowl slow twisters to him, and talk of the
glories of bygone Surrey heroes, with whom he had
played in former generations.) So Tom roused
himself, and took up his candle to go to bed ; and
then for the first time was aware of a beautiful new
fishing-rod, with old Eton's mark on it, and a
splendidly bound Bible, which lay on his table, on
the title-page of which was written--" TOM BROWN,
from his affectionate and grateful friends, Frances
Jane Arthur; George Arthur.”
I leave you all to guess how he slept, and what he
dreamt of.

TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH

end of the summer half-year at Rugby ; in fact, the
School has broken up. The fifth-form examinations

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
were over last week, and upon them have followed
the speeches, and the Sixth-form examinations for
exhibitions; and they too are over now. The boys
have gone to all the winds of heaven, except the
town boys and the eleven, and the few enthusiasts
besides who have asked leave to stay in their houses to
see the result of the cricket matches. For this year
the Wellesburn return match and the Marylebone
match are played at Rugby, to the great delight of
the town and neighbourhood, and the sorrow of those
aspiring young cricketers who have been reckoning
for the last three months on showing off at Lord's
ground.
The Doctor started for the Lakes yesterday
morning, after an interview with the captain of the
eleven, in the presence of Thomas, at which he
arranged in what School the cricket dinners were to
be, and all other matters necessary for the satis-
factory carrying out of the festivities; and warned
them as to keeping all spirituous liquors out of the
close, and having the gates closed by nine o'clock.
The Wellesburn match was played out with great
success yesterday, the School winning by three
wickets; and to-day the great event of the cricketing
year, the Marylebone match, is being played. What a
match it has been ! The London eleven came down
by an afternoon train yesterday, in time to see the
end of the Wellesburn match; and as soon as it
was over, their leading men and umpire inspected
the ground, criticising it rather unmercifully. The
captain of the School eleven, and one or two others,
who had played the Lord's match before, and knew
old Mr. Aislabie and several of the Lord's men, accom-
panied them: while the rest of the eleven looked on
from under the Three Trees with admiring eyes, and

asked. one another the names of the illustrious
strangers, and recounted how many runs each of them
had made in the late matches in Bell's Life. They
looked such hard-bitten, wiry, whiskered fellows,
that their young adversaries felt rather desponding
as to the result of the morrow's match. The ground
was at last chosen, and two men set to work upon it
to water and roll; and then, there being yet some
half-hour of daylight, some one had suggested a
dance on the turf. The close was half full of citizens
and their families, and the idea was hailed with
enthusiasm. The cornopean player was still on the
ground ; in five minutes the eleven and half-a-dozen of
the Wellesburn and Marylebone men got partners
somehow or another, and a merry country-dance
was going on, to which every one flocked, and new
couples joined in every minute, till there were a
hundred of them going down the middle and up
again—and the long line of School buildings looked
gravely down on them, every window glowing with
the last rays of the western sun, and the rooks clanged
about in the tops of the old elms, greatly excited,
and resolved on having their country-dance too, and
the great flag flapped lazily in the gentle western
breeze. Altogether it was a sight which would have
made glad the heart of our brave old founder,
Lawrence Sheriff, if he were half as good a fellow as
I take him to have been. It was a cheerful sight to
see; but what made it so valuable in the sight of the
Captain of the School eleven was, that he there saw
his young hands shaking off their shyness and awe
of the Lord's men, as they crossed hands and capered
about on the grass together; for the strangers entered
into it all, and threw away their cigars, and danced
and shouted like boys; while old Mr. Aislabie stood

by looking on in his white hat, leaning on a bat, in
benevolent enjoyment. “This hop will be worth
thirty runs to us to-morrow, and will be the making
of Raggles and Johnson,” thinks the young leader,
as he resolves many things in his mind, standing by
the side of Mr. Aislabie, whom he will not leave for a
minute, for he feels that the character of the School for
courtesy is resting on his shoulders.
But when a quarter to nine struck, and he saw old
Thomas beginning to fidget about with the keys in
his hand, he thought of the Doctor's parting monition,
and stopped the cornopean at once, notwithstanding
the loud-voiced remonstrances from all sides; and the
crowd scattered away from the close, the eleven all
going into the School-house, where supper and beds
were provided for them by the Doctor's orders.
Deep had been the consultations at supper as to
the order of going in, who should bowl the first over,
whether it would be best to play steady or freely ; and
the youngest hands declared that they shouldn't be
a bit nervous, and praised their opponents as the
jolliest fellows in the world, except perhaps their old
friends the Wellesburn men. How far a little good-
nature from their elders will go with the right sort
of boys!
The morning had dawned bright and warm, to
the intense relief of many an anxious youngster, up
betimes to mark the signs of the weather. The eleven
went down in a body before breakfast, for a plunge in
the cold bath in the corner of the close. The ground
was in splendid order, and soon after ten o'clock, before
spectators had arrived, all was ready, and two of the
Lord's men took their places at the wicket; the
School, with the usual liberality of young hands,
having put their adversaries in first. Old Bailey

159
stepped up to the wicket, and called play, and the
match has begun.
“Oh, well bowled ! well bowled, Johnson ! " cried
the Captain, catching up the ball and sending it
high above the rook trees, while the third Marylebone
man walks away from the wicket, and old Bailey
gravely sets up the middle stump again and puts the
bails on.
“How many runs ?” Away scamper three boys
to the scoring-table, and are back again in a minute
amongst the rest of the eleven, who are collected
together in a knot between wicket. “ Only eighteen
runs, and three wickets down ! ” “ Huzza for old
Rugby!" sings out Jack Raggles the long-stop,
toughest and burliest of boys, commonly called
“ Swiper Jack ;” and forthwith stands on his head,
and brandishes his legs in the air in triumph, till the
next boy catches hold of his heels and throws him
over on to his back.
.“ Steady there, don't be such an ass, Jack," says
the Captain, “ we haven't got the best wicket yet.
Ah, look out now at cover-point,” adds he, as he sees
a long-armed, bare-headed, slashing-looking player
coming to the wicket. “And, Jack, mind your hits;
he steals more runs than any man in England.”
And they all find that they have got their work to
do now; the new-comer's off-hitting is tremendous,
and his running like a flash of lightning. He is never
in his ground, except when his wicket is down.
Nothing in the whole game so trying to boys; he has
stolen three byes in the first ten minutes, and Jack
Raggles is furious, and begins throwing over savagely
to the further wicket, until he is sternly stopped by the
Captain. It is all that young gentleman can do to
keep his team steady, but he knows that everything

depends on it, and faces his work bravely. The
score creeps up to fifty, the boys begin to look blank,
and the spectators, who are now mustering strong,
are very silent. The ball flies off his bat to all parts
of the field, and he gives no rest and no catches to
any one. But cricket is full of glorious chances, and
the goddess who presides over it loves to bring down
the most skilful players. Johnson the young bowler
is getting wild, and bowls a ball almost wide to the
off; the batter steps out and cuts it beautifully to
where cover-point is standing very deep, in fact
almost off the ground. The ball comes skimming
and twisting along about three feet from the ground;
he rushes at it, and it sticks somehow or other in the
fingers of his left hand, to the utter astonishment of
himself and the whole field. Such a catch hasn't
been made in the close for years, and the cheering
is maddening. “Pretty cricket," says the Captain,
throwing himself on the ground by the deserted
wicket with a long breath; he feels that a crisis has
passed.
I wish I had space to describe the whole match ;
how the Captain stumped the next man off a leg-
shooter, and bowled slow lobs to old Mr. Aislabie,
who came in for the last wicket. How the Lord's
men were out by half-past twelve o'clock for ninety-
eight runs. How the Captain of the School eleven
went in first to give his men pluck, and scored twenty-
five in beautiful style ; how Rugby was only four
behind in the first innings. What a glorious dinner
they had in the fourth-form school, and how the
cover-point hitter sang the most topping comic
songs, and old Mr. Aislabie made the best speeches
that ever were heard, afterwards. But I haven't
the space, that's the fact, and so you must fancy it all,

161
and carry yourselves on to half-past seven o'clock,
when the school are again in, with five wickets down
and only thirty-two runs to make to win. The
Marylebone men played carelessly in their second
innings, but they are working like horses now to save
the match.
There is much healthy, hearty, happy life scattered
up and down the close ; but the group to which I
beg to call your especial attention is there, on the
slope of the island, which looks towards the cricket-
ground. It consists of three figures; two are seated
on a bench, and one on the ground at their feet. The
first, a tall, slight, and rather gaunt man; with a bushy
eyebrow, and a dry humorous smile, is evidently a
clergyman. He is carelessly dressed, and looks rather
used up, which isn't much to be wondered at, seeing
that he has just finished six weeks of examination
work; but there he basks, and spreads himself out
in the evening sun, bent on enjoying life, though he
doesn't quite know what to do with his arms and
legs. Surely it is our friend the young Master, whom
we have had glimpses of before, but his face has
gained a great deal since we last came across him.
And by his side, in white flannel shirt and trousers,
straw hat, the Captain's belt, and the untanned
yellow cricket shoes which all the eleven wear, sits a
strapping figure, nearly six feet high, with ruddy
tanned face and whiskers, curly brown hair, and a
laughing, dancing eye. He is leaning forward with
his elbows resting on his knees, and dandling his
favourite bat, with which he has made thirty or forty
runs to-day, in his strong brown hands. It is Tom
Brown, grown into a young man nineteen years old,
a præpostor and captain of the eleven, spending his
last day as a Rugby boy, and let us hope as much

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
wiser as he is bigger, since we last had the pleasure
of coming across him.
And at their feet on the warm dry ground, similarly
dressed, sits Arthur, Turkish fashion, with his bat
across his knees. He too is no longer a boy, less of a
boy in fact than Tom, if one may judge from the
thoughtfulness of his face, which is somewhat paler,
too, than one could wish ; but his figure though slight
is well knit and active, and all his old timidity has
disappeared, and is replaced by silent quaint fun,
with which his face twinkles all over, as he listens to
the broken talk between the other two, in which he
joins every now and then.
All three are watching the game eagerly, and
joining in the cheering which follows every good hit.
It is pleasing to see the easy friendly footing which
the pupils are on with their master, perfectly respect-
ful, yet with no reserve and nothing forced in their
intercourse. Tom has clearly abandoned the old
theory of “natural enemies ” in this case at any rate.
But it is time to listen to what they are saying, and
see what we can gather out of it.
“I don't object to your theory,” says the master,
“and I allow you have made a fair case for yourself.
But now, in such books as Aristophanes for instance,-
you've been reading a play this half with the Doctor,
haven't you?”
“Yes, the Knights,” answered Tom.
“Well, I'm sure you would have enjoyed the
wonderful humour of it twice as much if you had
taken more pains with your scholarship.”
“Well, sir, I don't believe any boy in the form
enjoyed the sets-to between Cleon and the Sausage-
seller more than I did-eh, Arthur ?” said Tom,
giving him a stir with his foot.

TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH 163
“ Yes, I must say he did,” said Arthur. “I
think, sir, you've hit upon the wrong book there."
“Not a bit of it,” said the master. “Why, in
those very passages of arms, how can you thoroughly
appreciate them unless you are master of the
weapons ? and the weapons are the language, which
you, Brown, have never half worked at; and so, as I
say, you must have lost all the delicate shades of
meaning which make the best part of the fun.”
“Oh! well played-bravo, Johnson ! ” shouted
Arthur, dropping his bat and clapping furiously,
and Tom joined in with a “ Bravo, Johnson!” which
might have been heard at the chapel.
“Eh! what was it ? I didn't see,” inquired the
the master; “they only got one run, I thought ?”
“No, but such a ball, three-quarters length and
coming straight for his leg bail. Nothing but that
turn of the wrist could have saved him, and he drew
it away to leg for a safe one. Bravo, Johnson!”
“How well they are bowling though,” said
Arthur; "they don't mean to be beat, I can
see."
“ There now,” struck in the master, “ you see
that's just what I have been preaching this half-hour.
The delicate play is the true thing. I don't under-
stand cricket, so I don't enjoy those fine draws which
you tell me are the best play, though when you or
Raggles hit a ball hard away for six I am as delighted
as any one. Don't you see the analogy ?”
“Yes, sir,” answered Tom, looking up roguishly,
“I see; only the question remains whether I should
have got most good by understanding Greek particles
or cricket thoroughly. I'm such a thick, I never
should have had time for both.”
“I see you are an incorrigible,” said the master

TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
with a chuckle,“ but I refute you by an example.
Arthur there has taken in Greek and cricket too."
“Yes, but no thanks to him ; Greek came natural
to him. Why, when he first came I remember he
used to read Herodotus for pleasure as I did Don
Quixote, and couldn't have made a false concord if
he'd tried ever so hard—and then I looked after his
cricket.”
“ Out! Bailey has given him out-do you see,
Tom ?” cries Arthur. “How foolish of them to run
so hard !”
“Well, it can't be helped, he has played very well.
Whose turn is it to go in ?”
“ I don't know; they've got your list in the tent.”
“Let's go and see," said Tom, rising ; but at this
moment Jack Raggles and two or three more come
running to the island moat.
“Oh, Brown, mayn't I go in next ? " shouts the
Swiper.
“ Whose name is next on the list ? ” says the
Captain.
“ Winter's, and then Arthur's," answers the boy
who carries it; “but there are only twenty-six runs
to get, and no time to lose. I heard Mr. Aislabie
say that the stumps must be drawn at a quarter-past
eight exactly."
“Oh, do let the Swiper go in,” chorus the boys;
so Tom yields against his better judgment.
“I dare say now I've lost the match by this
nonsense,” he says, as he sits down again. “They'll
be sure to get Jack's wicket in three or four minutes ;
however, you'll have the chance, sir, of seeing a hard
hit or two,” adds he, smiling, and turning to the
master.
“ Come, none of your irony, Brown," answers the

165
master. "I'm beginning to understand the game
scientifically. What a noble game it is too ! "
“Isn't it? But it's more than a game. It's an
institution,” said Tom.
“Yes,” said Arthur, “the birthright of British
boys, old and young, as habeas corpus and trial by
jury are of British men.”
“The discipline and reliance on one another which
it teaches is so valuable, I think,” went on the master,
“it ought to be such an unselfish game. It merges
the individual in the eleven; he doesn't play that he
may win, but that his side may.”
“ That's very true," said Tom, “ and that's why
football and cricket, now one comes to think of it, are
such much better games than fives or hare-and-hounds,
or any others where the object is to come in first or
to win for oneself, and not that one's side may win.”
“And then the Captain of the eleven!” said the
master, “what a post is his in our School-world !
almost as hard as the Doctor's; requiring skill and
gentleness and firmness, and I know not what other
rare qualities.”
“ Which don't he may wish he may get ? " said
Tom, laughing, “ at any rate he hasn't got them yet,
or he wouldn't have been such a flat to-night as to
let Jack Råggles go in out of his turn."
“Ah! the Doctor never would have done that,"
said Arthur demurely. “Tom, you've a great deal
to learn yet in the art of ruling."
“Well, I wish you'd tell the Doctor so, then, and
get him to let me stop till I'm twenty. I don't want
to leave, I'm sure.”
“What a sight it is,” broke in the master, “ the
Doctor as a ruler. Perhaps ours is the only little
corner of the British Empire which is thoroughly,


## p. 166 (#184) ############################################

166
TOM BROWY'S SCHOOL DAYS
wisely, and strongly ruled just now. I'm more and
more thankful every day of my life that I came here
to be under him.”
“So am I, I'm sure," said Tom; "and more and
more sorry that I've got to leave.”
“Every place and thing one sees here reminds
one of some wise act of his,” went on the master.
“ This island now—you remember the time, Brown,
when it was laid out in small gardens, and cultivated
by frost-bitten fags in February and March?”
“Of course I do," said Tom; “ didn't I hate
spending two hours in the afternoon grubbing in
the tough dirt with the stump of a fives-bat? But
turf-cart was good fun enough.”
“I dare say it was, but it was always leading to
fights with the townspeople ; and then the stealing
flowers out of all the gardens in Rugby for the Easter
show was abominable.”
“Well, so it was,” said Tom, looking down, “but
we fags couldn't help ourselves. But what has that
to do with the Doctor's ruling ?”
“A great deal, I think,” said the master; “what
brought island-fagging to an end ?”
“Why, the Easter Speeches were put off till Mid-
summer," said Tom,“ and the sixth had the gymnastic
poles put up here.”
“Well, and who changed the time of the Speeches,
and put the idea of gymnastic poles into the heads of
their worships the sixth form ? " said the master.
“ The Doctor, I suppose," said Tom. “I never
thought of that.”
“ Of course you didn't,” said the master, “or
else, fag as you were, you would have shouted with
the whole school against putting down old customs.
And that's the way that all the Doctor's reforms have

167
been carried out when he has been left to himself-
quietly and naturally, putting a good thing in the
place of a bad, and letting the bad die out; no
wavering and no hurry—the best thing that could
be done for the time being, and patience for the rest.”:
“Just Tom's own way," chimed in Arthur,
nudging Tom with his elbow, “ driving a nail where it
will go ; ” to which allusion Tom answered by a sly
kick.
“Exactly so," said the master, innocent of the
allusion and by-play.
Meantime Jack Raggles, with his sleeves tucked up
above his great brown elbows, scorning pads and
gloves, had presented himself at the wicket; and
having run one for a forward drive of Johnson's, is
about to receive his first ball. There are only twenty-
four runs to make, and four wickets to go down, a
winning match if they play decently steady. The ball
is a very swift one, and rises fast, catching Jack on the
outside of the thigh, and bounding away as if from
india-rubber, while they run two for a leg-bye amidst
great applause, and shouts from Jack's many
admirers. The next ball is a beautifully pitched ball
for the outer stump, which the reckless and unfeeling
Jack catches hold of, and hits round right to leg for
five, while the applause becomes deafening : only
seventeen runs to get with four wickets—the game
is all but ours !
It is “over” now, and Jack walks swaggering about
his wicket, with the bat over his shoulder, while Mr.
Aislabie holds a short parley with his men. Then the
cover-point hitter, that cunning man, goes on to bowl
slow twisters. Jack waves his hand triumphantly
towards the tent, as much as to say, “See if I don't
finish it all off now in three hits.”


## p. 168 (#186) ############################################

168
TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
Alas, my son Jack! the old enemy is too old for
thee. The first ball of the over Jack steps out and
meets, swiping with all his force. If he had only
allowed for the twist! but he hasn't, and so the ball
goes spinning up straight into the air, as if it would
never come down again. Away runs Jack, shouting
and trusting to the chapter of accidents, but the
bowler runs steadily under it, judging every spin,
and calling out, “ I have it,” catches it, and playfully
pitches it on to the back of the stalwart Jack, who is
departing with a rueful countenance.
“I knew how it would be,” says Tom, rising.
“ Come along, the game's getting very serious.”
So they leave the island and go to the tent, and
after deep consultation Arthur is sent in, and goes off
to the wicket with a last exhortation from Tom to
play steady and keep his bat straight. To the
suggestions that Winter is the best bat left, Tom only
replies, “ Arthur is the steadiest, and Johnson will
make the runs if the wicket is only kept up.”
“I am surprised to see Arthur in the eleven,"
said the master, as they stood together in front of
the dense crowd, which was now closing in round the
ground.
“Well, I'm not quite sure that he ought to be in
for his play," said Tom,“ but I couldn't help putting
him in. It will do him so much good, and you can't
think what I owe him.”
The master smiled. The clock strikes eight, and
the whole field becomes fevered with excitement.
Arthur, after two narrow escapes, scores one; and
Johnson gets the ball. The bowling and fielding are
superb, and Johnson's batting worthy the occasion.
He makes here a two, and there a one, managing to
keep the ball to himself, and Arthur backs up and

169
runs perfectly : only eleven runs to make now, and
the crowd scarcely breathe. At last Arthur gets the
ball again, and actually drives it forward for two,
and feels prouder than when he got the three best
prizes, at hearing. Tom's shout of joy, “ Well played,
well played, young un!”
But the next ball is too much for a young hand,
and his bails fly different ways. Nine runs to make,
and two wickets to go down—it is too much for
human nerves.
Before Winter can get in, the omnibus which is
to take the Lord's men to the train pulls up at the side
of the close, and Mr. Aislabie and Tom consult, and
give out that the stumps will be drawn after the next
over. And so ends the great match. Winter and
Johnson carry out their bats, and, it being a one day's
match, the Lord's men are declared the winners,
they having scored the most in the first innings.
But such a defeat is a victory : so think Tom and
all the School eleven, as they accompany their con-
querors to the omnibus, and send them off with three
ringing cheers, after Mr. Aislabie has shaken hands
all round, saying to Tom,“ I must compliment you,
sir, on your eleven, and I hope we shall have you for
a member if you come up to town.”
As Tom and the rest of the eleven were turning
back into the close, and everybody was beginning to
cry out for another country-dance, encouraged by the
success of the night before, the young master, who was
just leaving the close, stopped him, and asked him
to come up to tea at half-past eight, adding, “ I won't
keep you more than half-an-hour, and ask Arthur to
come up too.”
“I'll come up with you directly if you'll let me,"?
said Tom, “for I feel rather melancholy, and not

TOJ BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
quite up to the country-dance and supper with the
rest."
“Do by all means," said the master; “ I'll wait
here for you."
So Tom went off to get his boots and things from
the tent, to tell Arthur of the invitation, and to speak
to his second in command about stopping the dancing
and shutting up the close as soon as it grew dusk.
Arthur promised to follow as soon as he had had a
dance. So Tom handed his things over to the man
in charge of the tent, and walked quietly away to the
gate where the master was waiting, and the two took
their way together up the Hillmorton road.
Of course they found the master's house locked
up, and all the servants away in the close, about this
time no doubt footing it away on the grass with
extreme delight to themselves, and in utter oblivion
of the unfortunate bachelor their master, whose one
enjoyment in the shape of meals was his “ dish of
tea” (as our grandmothers called it) in the evening;
and the phrase was apt in his case, for he always
poured his out into the saucer before drinking.
Great was the good man's horror at finding himself
shut out of his own house. Had he been alone, he
would have treated it as a matter of course, and would
have strolled contentedly up and down his gravel-walk
until some one came home; but he was hurt at the
stain on his character of host, especially as the guest
was a pupil. However, the guest seemed to think it
a great joke, and presently, as they poked about
round the house, mounted a wall, from which he
could reach a passage window : the window, as it
turned out, was not bolted, so in another minute
Tom was in the house and down at the front door,
which he opened from inside. The master chuckled

TOM BROWN'S LAST MATCH
171
grimly at this burglarious entry, and insisted on
leaving the hall-door and two of the front windows
open, to frighten the truants on their return; and then
the two set about foraging for tea, in which operation
the master was much at fault, having the faintest
possible idea of where to find anything, and being
moreover wondrously short-sighted; but Tom by a
sort of instinct knew the right cupboards in the
kitchen and pantry, and soon managed to place on
the snuggery table better materials for a meal than
had appeared there probably during the reign of his
tutor, who was then and there initiated, amongst
other things, into the excellence of that mysterious
condiment, a dripping cake. The cake was newly
baked, and all rich and flaky ; Tom had found it
reposing in the cook's private cupboard, awaiting her
return; and as a warning to her, they finished it to the
last crumb. The kettle sang away merrily on the
hob of the snuggery, for, notwithstanding the time
of year, they lighted a fire, throwing both the windows
wide open at the same time; the heap of books and
papers were pushed away to the other end of the
table, and the great solitary engravings of King's
College Chapel over the mantelpiece looked less stiff
than usual, as they settled themselves down in the
twilight to the serious drinking of tea.
After some talk on the match, and other indifferent
subjects, the conversation came naturally back to
Tom's approaching departure, over which he began
again to make his moan.
“Well, we shall all miss you quite as much as you
will miss us,” said the master. “You are the Nestor
of the School now, are you not ?”
“Yes, ever since East left," answered Tom.
"By the by, have you heard from him ? "


## p. 172 (#190) ############################################

172 TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS
“Yes, I had a letter in February, just before he
started for India to join his regiment."
“ He will make a capital officer.”
“Ay, won't he!” said Tom, brightening, “no
fellow could handle boys better, and I suppose
soldiers are very like boys. And he'll never tell them
to go where he won't go himself. No mistake about
that-a braver fellow never walked.”
“His year in the sixth will have taught him a
good deal that will be useful to him now.”
"So it will,” said Tom, staring into the fire.
“Poor dear Harry,” he went on, “how well ]
remember the day we were put out of the twenty.
How he rose to the situation, and burnt his cigar-cases,
and gave away his pistols, and pondered on the
constitutional authority of the sixth, and his new
duties to the Doctor, and the fifth form, and the fags.
Aye, and no fellow ever acted up to them better,
though he was always a people's man—for the fags,
and against constituted authorities. He couldn't
help that, you know. I'm sure the Doctor must have
liked him ? " said Tom, looking up inquiringly.
“The Doctor sees the good in every one, and appre-
ciates it,” said the master dogmatically ; “but I hope
East will get a good colonel. He won't do if he can't
respect those above him. How long it took him even
here, to learn the lesson of obeying."
“Well, I wish I were alongside of him," said Tom.
“If I can't be at Rugby I want to be at work in the
world, and not dawdling away three years at Oxford.”
“What do you mean by' at work in the world'?”
said the master, pausing, with his lips close to his
saucerful of tea, and peering at Tom over it.
“Well, I mean real work; one's profession;
whatever one will have really to do, and make one's

living by. I want to be doing some real good, feeling
that I am not only at play in the world," answered
Tom, rather puzzled to find out himself what he
really did mean.
“ You are mixing up two very different things
in your head, I think, Brown,” said the master,
putting down his empty saucer, “ and you ought to
get clear about them. You talk of 'working to get
your living,' and ' doing some real good in the world,'
in the same breath. Now you may be getting a very
good living in a profession, and yet doing no good at.
all in the world, but quite the contrary, at the same
time. Keep the latter before you as your one object,
and you will be right, whether you make a living or
not; but if you dwell on the other, you'll very likely
drop into mere money-making, and let the world
take care of itself for good or evil. Don't be in a
hurry about finding your work in the world for
yourself—you are not old enough to judge for your-
self yet-but just look about you in the place you
find yourself in, and try to make things a little better
and honester there. You'll find plenty to keep your
hand in at Oxford, or wherever else you go. And
don't be led away to think this part of the world
important, and that unimportant. Every corner of
the world is important. No man knows whether
this part or that is most so, but every man may do
some honest work in his own corner.” And then the
good man went on to talk wisely to Tom of the sort of
work which he might take up as an undergraduate ;
and warned him of the prevalent University sins,
and explained to him the many and great differences
between University and School life; till the twilight
changed into darkness, and they heard the truant
servants stealing in by the back entrance.

“I wonder where Arthur can be," said Tom at
last, looking at his watch; “why, it's nearly half-
past nine already.”
“Oh, he is comfortably at supper with the eleven,
forgetful of his oldest friends," said the master.
“Nothing has given me greater pleasure,” he went
on, “ than your friendship for him ; it has been the
making of you both.”
“Of me, at any rate," answered Tom; “I should
never have been here now but for him. It was the
luckiest chance in the world that sent him to Rugby,
and made him my chum.”
“Why do you talk of lucky chances ?” said the
master; “I don't know that there are any such
things in the world ; at any rate there was neither
luck nor chance in that matter."
Tom looked at him inquiringly, and he went on.
“Do you remember when the Doctor lectured you
and East at the end of one half-year, when you were
in the shell, and had been getting into all sorts of
scrapes ?”
“Yes, well enough,” said Tom, “it was the half-
year before Arthur came.”
“Exactly so," answered the master. “Now, I
was with him a few minutes afterwards, and he was
in great distress about you two. And, after some talk,
we both agreed that you in particular wanted some
object in the School beyond games and mischief,
for it was quite clear that you never would make the
regular school work your first object. And so the
Doctor, at the beginning of the next half-year, looked
out the best of the new boys, and separated you and
East, and put the young boy into your study, in the
hope that when you had somebody to lean on you,
you would begin to stand a little steadier yourself,

and get manliness and thoughtfulness. And I can
assure you, he has watched the experiment ever
since with great satisfaction. Ah! not one of you
boys will ever know the anxiety you have given him,
or the care with which he has watched over every
step in your school lives.”
Up to this time Tom had never wholly given in to,
or understood the Doctor. At first he had thoroughly
feared him. For some years, as I have tried to show,
he had learnt to regard him with love and respect,
and to think him a very great and wise and good man.
But, as regarded his own position in the School, of
which he was no little proud, Tom had no idea of
giving any one credit for it but himself; and, truth
to tell, was a very self-conceited young gentleman
on the subject. He was wont to boast that he had
fought his own way fairly up the School, and had
never made up to, or been taken up by, any big
fellow or master, and that it was now quite a different
place from what it was when he first came. And,
indeed, though he didn't actually boast of it, yet
in his secret soul he did to a great extent believe, that
the great reform in the School had been owing quite
as much to himself as to any one else. Arthur, he
acknowledged, had done him good, and taught him
a good deal, so had other boys in different ways; but
they had not had the same means of influence on the
School in general; and as for the Doctor, why, he
was a splendid master; but every one knew that
masters could do very little out of school hours. In
short, he felt on terms of equality with his chief, so
far as the social state of the School was concerned,
and thought that the Doctor would find it no easy
matter to get on without him. Moreover, his school
Toryism was still strong, and he looked still with some

jealousy on the Doctor, as somewhat of a fanatic
in the matter of change; and thought it very desirable
for the School that he should have some wise person
(such as himself) to look sharply after vested school
rights, and see that nothing was done to the injury of
the republic without due protest.
It was a new light to him to find that, besides
teaching the sixth, and governing and guiding the
whole School, editing classics, and writing histories,
the great Head-master had found time in those busy
years to watch over the career, even of him, Tom
Brown, and his particular friends,-ånd, no doubt,
of fifty other boys at the same time, and all this
without taking the least credit to himself, or seeming
to know, or let any one else know, that he ever thought
particularly of any boy at all.
However, the Doctor's victory was complete from
that moment over Tom Brown at any rate. He
gave way at all points, and the enemy marched right
over him, cavalry, infantry, and artillery, the land
transport corps, and the camp followers. It had
taken eight long years to do it, but now it was done
thoroughly, and there wasn't a corner of him left
which didn't believe in the Doctor. Had he returned
to school again, and the Doctor begun the half-year
by abolishing fagging, and football, and Saturday
half-holiday, or all or any of the most cherished school
institutions, Tom would have supported him with
the blindest faith. And so, after a half confession
of his previous shortcomings, and sorrowful adieus
to his tutor, from whom he received two beautifully
bound volumes of the Doctor's Sermons as a parting
present, he marched down to the School-house, a hero-
worshipper, who would have satisfied the soul of
Thomas Carlyle himself.

There he found the eleven at high jinks after
supper, Jack Raggles shouting comic songs, and
performing feats of strength; and was greeted by a
chorus of mingled remonstrance at his desertion, and
joy at his reappearance. And falling in with the
humour of the evening, was soon as great a boy as all
the rest; and at ten o'clock was chaired round the
quadrangle, on one of the hall benches borne aloft
by the eleven, shouting in chorus, “ For he's a jolly
good fellow,” while old Thomas, in a melting mood,
and the other School-house servants, stood looking on.
And the next morning after breakfast he squared
up all the cricketing accounts, went round to his
tradesmen and other acquaintance, and said his
hearty good-byes ; and by twelve o'clock was in the
train, and away for London, no longer a school-boy,
and divided in his thoughts between hero-worship,
honest regrets over the long stage of his life which
was now slipping out of sight behind him, and hopes
and resolves for the next stage, upon which he was
entering with all the confidence of a young traveller.

In the summer of 1842, our hero stopped once again
at the well-known station; and, leaving his bag and
fishing-rod with a porter, walked slowly and sadly
up towards the town. It was now July. He had
rushed away from Oxford the moment that term
was over, for a fishing ramble in Scotland with two
college friends, and had been for three weeks living

on oatcake, mutton hams, and whiskey, in the wildest
parts of Skye. They had descended one sultry evening
on the little inn at Kyle Rhea ferry, and while Tom
and another of the party put their tackle together
and began exploring the stream for a sea-trout for
supper, the third strolled into the house to arrange
for their entertainment. Presently he came out in a
loose blouse and slippers, a short pipe in his mouth,
and an old newspaper in his hand, and threw himself
on the heathery scrub which met the shingle, within
easy hail of the fishermen. There he lay, the picture
of free-and-easy, loafing, hand-to-mouth young
England, “ improving his mind,” as he shouted to
them, by the perusal of the fortnight-old weekly
paper, soiled with the marks of toddy-glasses and
tobacco ashes, the legacy of the last traveller, which
he had hunted out from the kitchen of the little
hostelry, and being a youth of a communicative turn
of mind, began imparting the contents to the fishermen
as he went on
“What a bother they are making about these
wretched Corn Laws; here's three or four columns
full of nothing but sliding scales and fixed duties.
Hang this tobacco, it's always going out !-Ah, here's
something better-a splendid match between Kent
and England, Brown! Kent winning by three
wickets. Felix fifty-six runs without a chance, and
not out!”
Tom, intent on a fish which had risen at him
twice, answered only with a grunt.
“ Anything about the Goodwood ? " called out the
third man.
“Rory-o-More drawn. Butterfly colt amiss,"
shouted the student.
“ Just my luck,” grumbled the inquirer, jerking

his flies off the water, and throwing again with a
heavy, sullen splash, and frightening Tom's fish.
“I say, can't you throw lighter over there ? we
ain't fishing for grampuses,” shouted Tom across the
stream.
“Hullo, Brown! here's something for you,"
called out the reading man next moment. “Why,
your old master, Arnold of Rugby, is dead.”
Tom's hand stopped half-way in his cast, and his
line and flies went all tangling round and round his
rod; you might have knocked him over with a feather.
Neither of his companions took any notice of him,
luckily; and with a violent effort he set to work
mechanically to disentangle his line. He felt com-
pletely carried off his moral and intellectual legs, as
if he had lost his standing-point in the invisible
world. Besides which, the deep loving loyalty which
he felt for his old leader made the shock intensely
painful. It was the first great wrench of his life,
the first gap which the angel Death had made in his
circle, and he felt numbed, and beaten down, and
spiritless. Well, well ! I believe it was good for him
and for many others in like case ; who had to learn by
that loss, that the soul of man cannot stand or lean
upon any human prop, however strong, and wise,
and good ; but that He upon whom alone it can stand
and lean will knock away all such props in His own
wise and merciful way, until there is no ground or
stay left but Himself, the Rock of Ages, upon whom
alone a sure foundation for every soul of man is
laid.
As he wearily laboured at his line, the thought
struck him, “ It may all be false, a mere newspaper
lie," and he strode up to the recumbent smoker.
“Let me look at the paper,” said he.

“ Nothing else in it,” answered the other, handing
it up to him listlessly.—“Hullo, Brown! what's the
matter, old fellow—ain't you well ? ”
“Where is it?” said Tom, turning over the
leaves, his hands trembling, and his eyes swimming,
so that he could not read.
“What? What are you looking for?” said his
friend, jumping up and looking over his shoulder.
“That-about Arnold," said Tom.
“Oh, here,” said the other, putting his finger on
the paragraph. Tom read it over and over again ;
there could be no mistake of identity, though the
account was short enough.
“ Thank you,” said he at last, dropping the paper,
“I shall go for a walk : don't you and Herbert wait
supper for me.” And away he strode, up over the
moor at the back of the house, to be alone, and master
his grief if possible.
His friend looked after him, sympathizing and
wondering, and knocking the ashes out of his pipe,
walked over to Herbert. After a short parley, they
walked together up to the house.
“I'm afraid that confounded newspaper has
spoiled Brown's fun for this trip.”
“How odd that he should be so fond of his old
master,” said Herbert. Yet they also were both
public-school men.
The two, however, notwithstanding Tom's pro-
hibition, waited supper for him, and had everything
ready when he came back some half-an-hour after-
wards. But he could not join in their cheerful talk,
and the party was soon silent, notwithstanding the
efforts of all three. One thing only had Tom resolved,
and that was that he couldn't stay in Scotland any
longer ; he felt an irresistible longing to get to Rugby,

and then home, and soon broke it to the others, who
had too much tact to oppose.
So by daylight the next morning he was marching
through Inverness, and in the evening hit the
Caledonian canal, took the next steamer, and travelled
as fast as boat and railway could carry him to the
Rugby station.
As he walked up to the town, he felt shy and
afraid of being seen, and took the back streets; why,
he didn't know, but he followed his instinct. At the
school-gates he made a dead pause; there was not
a soul in the quadrangle—all was lonely, and silent,
and sad. So with another effort he strode through
the quadrangle, and into the School-house offices.
He found the little matron in her room in deep
mourning ; shook her hand, tried to talk, and moved
nervously about : she was evidently thinking of the
same subject as he, but he couldn't begin talking.
“ Where shall I find Thomas ?” said he at last,
getting desperate.
“ In the servants' hall, I think, sir. But won't
you take anything ?” said the matron, looking rather
disappointed.
“No, thank you,” said he, and strode off again
to find the old Verger, who was sitting in his little
den as of old, puzzling over hieroglyphics.
He looked up through his spectacles, as Tom
seized his hand and wrung it.
“Ah! you've heard all about it, sir, I see,"
said he.
Tom nodded, and then sat down on the shoe-
board, while the old man told his tale, and wiped
his spectacles, and fairly flowed over with quaint,
homely, honest sorrow.
By the time he had done, Tom felt much better.

Where is he buried, Thomas ? " said he at last.
“ Under the altar in the chapel, sir,” answered
Thomas. “You'd like to have the key, I dare say."
“ Thank you, Thomas.—Yes, I should very much.”
And the old man fumbled among his bunch, and then
got up, as though he would go with him; but after a
few steps stopped short, and said, “ Perhaps you'd
like to go by yourself, sir ?”.
Tom nodded, and the bunch of keys were handed
to him, with an injunction to be sure and lock the door
after him, and bring them back before eight o'clock.
He walked quickly through the quadrangle and
out into the close. The longing which had been
upon him and driven him thus far, like the gad-fly in
the Greek legends, giving him no rest in mind or
body, seemed all of a sudden not to be satisfied, but
to shrivel up, and pall. “Why should I go on?
It's no use,” he thought, and threw himself at full
length on the turf, and looked vaguely and listlessly
at all the well-known objects. There were a few of
the town boys playing cricket, their wicket pitched
on the best piece in the middle of the big-side ground,
a sin about equal to sacrilege in the eyes of a captain
of the eleven. He was very nearly getting up to go
and send them off. “Pshaw ! they won't remember
me. They've more right there than I,” he muttered.
And the thought that his sceptre had departed, and
his mark was wearing out, came home to him for the
first time, and bitterly enough. He was lying on
the very spot where the fights came off; where he
himself had fought six years ago his first and last
battle. He conjured up the scene till he could almost
hear the shouts of the ring, and East's whisper in his
ear; and looking across the close to the Doctor's
private door, half expected to see it open, and the

tall figure in cap and gown come striding under the
elm-trees towards him.
No, no! that sight could never be seen again.
There was no flag flying on the round tower; the
School-house windows were all shuttered up: and
when the flag went up again, and the shutters came
down, it would be to welcome a stranger. All that
was left on earth of him whom he had honoured, was
lying cold and still under the chapel floor. He would
go in and see the place once more, and then leave it
once for all. New men and new methods might do
for other people ; let those who would worship the
rising star, he at least would be faithful to the sun
which had set. And so he got up, and walked to the
chapel door and unlocked it, fancying himself the
only mourner in all the broad land, and feeding on his
own selfish sorrow.
He passed through the vestibule, and then paused
for a moment to glance over the empty benches.
His heart was still proud and high, and he walked
up to the seat which he had last occupied as a sixth-
form boy, and sat himself down there to collect his
thoughts.
And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and
setting in order not a little. The memories of eight
years were all dancing through his brain, and carrying
him about whither they would ; while beneath them
all, his heart was throbbing with the dull sense of a
loss that could never be made up to him. The rays
of the evening sun came solemnly through the painted
windows above his head, and fell in gorgeous colours
on the opposite wall, and the perfect stillness soothed
his spirit by little and little. And he turned to the
pulpit, and looked at it, and then, leaning forward with
his head on his hands, groaned aloud. “If he could

only have seen the Doctor again for one five minutes;
have told him all that was in his heart, what he owed
to him, how he loved and reverenced him, and would
by God's help follow his steps in life and death, he
could have borne it all without a murmur. But that
he should have gone away for ever without knowing
it all, was too much to bear ”— “But am I sure that
he does not know it all ?”—the thought made him
start—“May he not even now be near me, in this very
chapel ? If he be, am I sorrowing as he would have
me sorrow—as I should wish to have sorrowed when
I shall meet him again ? "
He raised himself up and looked round ; and after
a minute rose and walked humbly down to the lowest
bench, and sat down on the very seat which he had
occupied on his first Sunday at Rugby. And then
the old memories rushed back again, but softened
and subdued, and soothing him as he let himself be
carried away by them. And he looked up at the
great painted window above the altar, and remem-
bered how when a little boy he used to try not to
look through it at the elm-trees and the rooks, before
the painted glass came—and the subscription for the
painted glass, and the letter he wrote home for
money to give to it. And there, down below, was the
very name of the boy who sat on his right hand on
that first day, scratched rudely in the oak panelling.
And then came the thought of all his old school-
fellows; and form after form of boys, nobler, and
braver, and purer than he, rose up and seemed to
rebuke him. Could he not think of them, and what
they had felt and were feeling, they who had honoured
and loved from the first, the man whom he had taken
years to know and love ? Could he not think of
those yet dearer to him who was gone, who bore his

name and shared his blood, and were now without a
husband or a father ? Then the grief which he began
to share with others became gentle and holy, and he
rose up once more, and walked up the steps to the
altar; and while the tears flowed freely down his
cheeks, knelt down humbly and hopefully, to lay
down there his share of a burden which had proved
itself too heavy for him to bear in his own strength.
Here let us leave him—where better could we
leave him than at the altar before which he had first
caught a glimpse of the glory of his birthright, and
felt the drawing of the bond which links all living
souls together in one brotherhood-at the grave
beneath the altar of him, who had opened his eyes to
see that glory, and softened his heart till it could feel
that bond.
And let us not be hard on him, if at that moment
his soul is fuller of the tomb and him who lies there,
than of the altar and Him of whom it speaks. Such
stages have to be gone through, I believe, by all
young and brave souls, who must win their way
through hero-worship, to the worship of Him who is
the King and Lord of heroes. For it is only through
our mysterious human relationships, through the love
and tenderness and purity of mothers, and sisters,
and wives, through the strength and courage and
wisdom of fathers, and brothers, and teachers, that
we can come to the knowledge of Him, in whom alone
the love, and the tenderness, and the purity, and the
strength, and the courage, and the wisdom of all these
dwell for ever and ever in perfect fulness.
