PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.
English Dept. GW11-3-36
WHEN this Novel was first published, fifteen years
ago, and I was far from foreseeing that my own
fortune would become partially involved in a catas-
Strophe similar to the one described in its pages,
I dedicated it to my banker and trustee, the late
-Sir John Dean Paul. To his conduct in either
capacity, or to certain extraordinary coincidences
connected with the story, it would be ungenerous
now to advert, further than to justify myself for
having cancelled the dedication.
+Concerning the literary portion of the work, 1
must be permitted to add a few words. The character
of the simple-hearted Anglo-Indian Colonel pour-
Utrayed in its pages, has been asserted by many to
contain a germ since charmingly developed by a far
abler and more popular novelist.
But though my friend Michael Angelo Titmarsh
has, by his witty parodies and criticisms, contributed

largely to the demolition of my summer-houses, he
is incapable of converting the rubbish into building
materials for more solid structures.-Colonel Hamil-

the same family-tree ;-my Colonel, like many other
elder brothers, exhibiting fewer advantages of edu-
cation. Let me however solicit for the disabled
veteran, thus superseded, a shelter in the Chelsea
Hospital of public favour. +

THE BANKER'S WIFE.
“Scenes form'd for contemplation, and to nurse
The growing seeds of wisdom, that suggest,
By every pleasing image they present,
Reflections such as meliorate the heart."--COWPE”.
A LOVER of the picturesque, whether poet, painter, or
simply an enjoyer of Nature's works, may be justified,
perhaps, in extending his quest after the sublime and
beautiful beyond the limits of the rich but monotonous
landscapes of Old England. But, while the indented
shores of Naples or cloud-capt mountains of Switzerland
attract these dreamy wanderers to fill their albums and
sketch-books with sonnets in sixteen lines, or daubings
in bistre and cobalt, a notable counter-charm is produced
on the minds of foreign tourists in our own country by
the neatness, order, and fertility of our rural districts.
Scarcely a county but boasts its series of cheerful
villages and aristocratic residences,-from the stately
gothic hall of earlier centuries to the commodious family
mansion of modern times, surrounded by spreading parks
and trimly gardens ;-nor is it easy to travel ten miles in
England without passing the lodge-gates of some private
domain, unmentioned save in the obscure annals of county-
history, which, if the summer residence of some German
principicule, would be signalized to tourists with all the
descriptive pomp of a guide-book, or the onerous eloquence
of the valet de place.
If, for instance, as a stranger in the land, you stop to
dine or sleep at the little country inn of Ovington, and
inquire of mine host of the Burlington Arms whether
the neighbourhood contain any object of interest, he will

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
answer, with a stultified look, that there is nothing
thereabouts worth speaking on.”
“There's the Hyde-an old place as 'longs to the
Vernon family,--and Squire Hamlyn's, at Dean Park;
besides Sir Rudger Burlinton's, further up along the
river. But none on 'em show-places : and the gentry
as likes to visit grand houses be forced to cut across the
country, to Burleigh, or Belvoir."
Nevertheless, these three domains—the Hyde, Bur-
lington Manor, and Dean Park—are severally citable as
models of rural beauty; the neighbourhood which, within
a circle of fifteen miles, comprehends the three properties
in question, affording a favourable type of that rich and
smiling order of home-landscape which seems almost to
embody a portraiture of our social institutions: nothing
salient-nothing discordant-a limited horizon-a plea-
sant foreground, with symbols of peace
and prosperity
interposing between, and abundant evergreens to plant
out the offices, in order to gratify the taste of those who
care less whether Lazarus be sitting famished and suffer-
ing at their gates, than that the gates should be sufficiently
solid to exclude the spectacle of so piteous an object.
The parish of Ovington is, in short, a beautiful country,
-watered by a fine river-prospered by a fertile soil
unmolested by commercial speculation-undisturbed by
factories-unvulgarized by villas ;-a country, such as
George Robins would have delighted to describe in his
largest capitals and most sonorous periods, had either of
the noble mansions in question fallen, at any moment,
under the branding-iron of his pen or hammer.
At the period to which the reader's attention is humbly
requested, the fairest of these estates had of late narrowly
escaped this degrading contingency. For nearly a year,
it
had remained an undecided point among the executors of
the late Sir Roger Burlington, whether Burlington Manor
should be sold outright, to pay off the mortgages on the
Yorkshire property of his son, (a minor, scarcely past the
age of infancy,) or whether the place should be let on
lease for a term of twenty-one years.
The latter alternative carried the day; thanks, as it
was believed, to the advocacy of the most zealous of the

guardians, Mr. Hamlyn of Dean Park, whose estate
adjoined, and who was supposed to tremble at the idea
of seeing the Burlington property fall into the hands of
some moneyed speculator, disposed to turn to account
the facilities of the fine stream traversing the two pro-
perties. A respectable and quiet neighbour, secured by
his own interference, was a most important object to him ;
and it was probably an argument of some weight with
his co-executors and trustees that, precisely at the right
moment, he was able to produce the one man needful, in
the person of a wealthy colonel of the East India Company's
Engineering Service, recently returned from Bombay.
Richard Hamlyn was one of those fortune-favoured
individuals who seem born with a knack for producing
the right thing at the right moment. Though qualified
by the innkeeper of Ovington as “Squire Hamlyn,” there
was little enough of the “Squire” in the estated pro-
prietor of Dean Park. He was simply a London banker;?
-a cold, methodical, prudent man, taking as much pride
in his country-seat as the engrossing nature of a thriving
business allowed him to take in anything out of Lombard
Street; but eager as a matter of interest to secure his
property against the deterioration of manufacturing inno-
vation. With the terror of steam-engines or spinning-
jennies before his eyes, it was a comfort indeed to find
such a man as his friend Colonel Hamilton established,,
for the rest of his life, at Burlington Manor.
The new tenant had been for years a valued consti-
tuent of the banking-house of Hamlyn and Co.; and, on
arriving in England, it was to Richard, the acting partner,
his correspondent for twenty years past, that he addressed
himself, as a friend and counsellor, in matters even of
more personal interest than the investment of his lacs
of rupees.
Though he had passed nearly half a century in banish-
ment, Colonel Hamilton had been driven home from
India several years before the epoch he had mentally
fixed for his return,-(the completion of a fortune of
four hundred thousand pounds !)—by the loss of his wife,
and a severe illness—the first in his life-consequent
upon this heartfelt bereavement. But the moment he

set foot on his native soil, and cast the slough engendered
by a long life of slavery to Mammon, the old man became
reconciled to leave the cipher of his fortune at three
hundred and forty-two thousand; deciding that, at sixty-
five
years
of
age, it was better to content himself with
these ample means of enjoyment; for, having out-lived
his two sons, who left no posterity to inherit his fine
fortune, he had to choose between bequeathing his pro-
perty to distant relations, or earning a posthumous statue
and newspaper renown, from the gratitude of some public
institution.
A London banker is not the man to refuse his friend.
ship or advice to an heirless old gentleman, with a
floating capital of hundreds of thousands. Cold and
- mechanical as were Mr. Hamlyn’s habits of life, he put
himself almost out of his way to seek a suitable London
residence for Colonel Hamilton, the moment he began to
complain of the hot rooms and cold mulligatawny of the
hotel in the Adelphi to which he had resorted on his ar-
rival, as the only one still extant which he remembered
as a boy. Many were “the substantial town mansions"
which Mr. Hamlyn commended to the notice of the
nabob for the remainder of the season. But the old
gentleman, with his over-brimming purse and indefinite
purposes, like a sailor returned from a cruise in a hurry
to get rid of his prize-money, was determined to purchase.
As if he could not make too much haste in securing him-
self a footing in his native country, he concluded a hasty
bargain for a commodious house in Portland Place; and,
for some weeks, amused himself and enriched the uphol-
sterers by the effort of furnishing.
But no sooner was all arranged on what appeared to his
friends the Hamlyns the most comfortable and liberal
footing, than the Colonel, for want of further occupation,
began to grumble. Day after day did he make his appear-
ance at their house in Cavendish Square, with some com-
plaint against the climate or customs of the metropolis !
Luckily, he was far from a peevish grumbler. He was
a laughing rather than a crying philosopher; and ban-
tered his own fastidiousness so good-humouredly, that

in the city, his complaints were usually confided, was far
more amused than wearied by his Chapter of Lamentations.
“ Betwixt ourselves, my good lady,” said he, after en-
sconcing himself in an arm-chair by the fire-side, one
gloomy morning in January, when the leafless trees in
Cavendish Square looked as grim and ghastly through the
fog as the spectral forms of Ossian's heroes, -“ betwixt
ourselves, I own myself plaguily disappointed in this
Lon'on of yours! The few first days in any country are
a sad take-in-more especially in one's native land, after
fifty years' absence. The excitement of finding one'self
among fellow-creatures of one's own creed and com-
plexion, and hearing spoken around one the language of
one's boyhood—the language in which one's parents pro-
nounced their blessing on one's head at parting—is apt
to bring tears into one's eyes that blind them to other
matters. At first I thought I could never see enough of
busy, prosperous Lon'on; and I vow to my Maker there
were moments when I could have found it in my heart".
to kneel down and kiss the sooty earth under my feet,
(old blockhead that I was !) because it was that of Old
England. But, at a week's end, ma'am, I began to see
clearer. After I'd been knocked about a bit, and jeered
by the Cockneys every time I ventured to ask a question,
or put my nose out of doors in a coat or waistcoat differ-
ing in cut from those of the weekly fashion-mongers, I
recognised the folly of giving way to such warm emotions
among a race of folks who dare not yield to a single
natural impulse, from fear of what their finer neighbours)
may be thinking of 'em !"

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“ Mr. Hamlyn has, I am sure, sincere pleasure in any
little service he may be able to render you!" replied his
companion, without raising her eyes from her work.
“ I believe you—I really believe you; only we differ,
maybe, in our notions of service. My friend Hamlyn
thinks it a matter of kindness to be always setting me
right about little idle, empty, fussy ceremonies of society,
concerning which, 'twixt you and I, my dear ma'am, I
care not a button! When I propose anything he thinks
out of the common, by way of making those about me
comfortable, or myself happy, he's sure to remind me that
such is not the custom of this country,' or, that ''tis
contrary to the usages of the world.' Bless your heart !
I've lived too long where the usages of the world were of
no account, to submit patiently to the thraldom of a net-
work of copper-lace and spangles! God forbid I should
behave myself like a Hottentot. But I can't fancy that
Hamlyn's favourite 'world' would have gone on a jot the
worse had you brought your girls to dine with me on
Tuesday: or if I'd persisted in giving up my back par-
lour for the use of my man Johnston and his wife, who
in Indy were not used to mope away their days in cellars!"
have such a capital housekeeper's room in
Portland Place," remonstrated Mrs. Hamlyn-subdued
by the force of habit into unquestioning acquiescence in
the opinions of her husband. “With respect to my
daughters, as Mr. Hamlyn mentioned to you before, they
aro not out. Lydia is little more than sixteen-her sister,
two years younger. Both are still in the schoolroom.
They do not even dine at our own table.”
“So much the worse, ma'am-so much the worse-one
of the very things I complain of! Little more than six-
teen, indeed? Why, in Indy she'd be a wife by this
time-perhaps a mother. And not allowed to share the
meals of her parents ? not permitted to dine with her
father's old friend? Always with the governess--always
at her studies! What's the use of such excess of edica-
tion for young ladies, pray, unless to teach 'em to play
their parts prettily in society? And how the deuce is a
girl ever to learn to become a woman, if excluded from
the company of gentlemen and ladies till, without know-

ing her cue, the curtain suddenly draws up, and she finds
herself alone upon the stage ?"
“The late hours Mr. Hamlyn is obliged to keep," ob-
served the banker's wife, careful not to admit how far
more closely her ideas of happiness and propriety agreed
with those of the warm-hearted Colonel than those of her
austere husband, “would scarcely be advantageous to the
girls. With respect to having declined your kind invi-
tation, had they dined in Portland Place, my own family,
which is numerous, would have claimed the same excep-
tion in their favour.”
• Ay, ay, ay! it all sounds mighty plausible and Mrs.
Goodchild-ish!” interrupted the Colonel, shrugging his
shoulders. “But the long and the short of these wise
regulations is, that such rule-and-compass work in the
bosom of families is making away with everything like
warmth of feeling, and shrivelling up social interest into
a manual of etiquette. Household happiness is too joy-
ous a thing, ma’am, to be worked by steam. I vow to
my Maker I'd as soon live in a penitentiary, and be rung
in to meals and exercise like a felon, as be cramped up
eternally in my loves and likings by à code of heartless
decorum."
“I trust your kind feelings towards my girls are not
likely to be cramped by the methodical habits of the
family ?” observed Mrs. Hamlyn, with a smile.
“That's more than I'll take upon me to say. What
will those poor children ever care about me, pray, whom
they're called away from their forte-piano once a week to
curtsey to, and hope I'm well, and whom they never see
in the exercise of human charities ? I'm disappointed,
my dear ma’am-I'm sadly disappointed! I've no family
left of my own, the more's the pity; and, being fond of
young people, 'twas a comfort to me, in returning to this
country, to think of surrounding myself with innocent,
happy faces ;-if not those of my own kith and kin, at
least the kith and kin of my friends. And what's the
end on't? I vow to my Maker I was not more lonesome
in my bungalow at Ghazerapore, than in my fine, showy,
comfortable, comfortless house in Portland Place! Most
of my acquaintance in Lon'on are men of business, tied

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
down to their occupations; and, as to the ladies, my
friend Hamlyn gave me a broad hint t'other night over
our claret, that 'tisn't the custom of what he calls the
world, for gentlemen to indulge in too frequent morning
calls-
“Be assured,” interrupted Mrs. Hamlyn, for once
raising her eyes from her work, “ that my husband in-
tended no allusion to his own house or family in the
prohibition."
“I know it, my dear good lady, I know it. If you'd
allow me to finish my sentence, I was going to add, 'ex-
cept in the case of so warm a friendship and intimacy as
unites ourselves. And so, you see, the consequence of
this last piece of schooling of Hamlyn's will be to trouble
you twice as often with my company. He well knows
you are the only folks in Lon’on with whom I'm on any-
thing like a friendly footing; and at the snail's-pace rate
at which acquaintances are made in this confounded foggy
metropolis, I shall have leisure to die and be catacombed
in one or t’other of the new cemeteries, long afore I've
brought myself to more than a distant bow with my next-
door neighbours."
“ The vast extension of society in London," observed
Mrs. Hamlyn, her habitual serenity unruffled by the
vehemence of her companion, “has necessitated a degree
of caution in the formation of intimacy which, to persons
habituated to the sociability of a colony, may appear
coldness and reserve. But an intimacy, once created,
soon ripens into friendship; and the friendship once
really matured ripens and brings forth fruit, an inherit-
ance from generation to generation.”
“So much the better for those who've patience to wait
so long. But my heart's not like an aloe, my dear ma'am,
that wants a hundred years to bring it into bloom; and
I've learnt, to my cost, that a winter in Lon’on (which
in Indy we're apt to fancy the summum bonum of
human sociability) is about as cheerful a thing as a
judgeship two thousand miles up the country, or a soli-
tary detachment in the Ghaûts."
• Winter is generally admitted to be an unsociable
moment in London," said Mrs. Hamlyn, quietly. “Most

people who have family seats spend their Christmas in
The country. This is the first winter I have passed in
town for the last ten years.”
“ And how came you to pass it here ?" demanded the
matter-of-fact old gentleman.
Mrs. Hamlyn was busy picking up her scissors, and did
not hear. But the Colonel, who seldom asked questions
except with the view of obtaining information, reiterated
his interrogation.
“Mr. Hamlyn fancied, I believe," replied the lady, thus
forced to an ungracious explanation," that you would
find it dull, if left in town without a single family of your
acquaintance."
Grateful conviction glistened in Colonel Hamilton's
eyes as he replied: “And so, then, you're all doing pe-
nance in Lon’on for my sake? That was mons'ously kindly
thought of on Hamlyn's part,” added he, after a moment's
consideration. “ To be sure, if dull and lonesome now,
I should have been fit to hang myself when you were all
off to Warwickshire. Poor girls! poor young ladies, I
should have said. I understand now why Miss Lydia
complained to me t'other day of the tediousness of pa-
rading, morning after morning, round and round yonder
square like a squirrel in a cage. But I didn't guess,
poor little lady, that I was the cause of moping her up,
away from her pony and her country pleasures. Well!
I shall always think 'twas a mons'ous friendly sacrifice
on the part of Hamlyn.”.
• My husband is not able to enjoy much of his time at
Dean Park," replied the veracious wife. “He can seldom
spare more than an occasional Saturday and Sunday, and
a week or two at Easter and Christmas."
“And why the deuce couldn't be take me with him
then, to spend Christmas in the country ?”
“I heard him speak of your having important business
to wind up at the India House.”
" True, very true!--Hamlyn's such a steady, thought-
ful dog, where business is concerned !"
“Mr. Hamlyn fancied, too, you might be disinclined
to move, so shortly after settling yourself in your charm-
ing house in Portland Place."

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
“My dear lady, I should be mighty glad to turn my
back on my charming house in Portland Place! To teil
you the honest truth, I'm sick to death of the sight of
those eternal damask curtains and rosewood tables! What
interest have I in Lon’on ?-I care for nobody, and no-
body cares for me. I look out at my windows half the
day, like a chained dog from its kennel, at the houses of
my opposite neighbours,—whose very names I don't know
from Adam, except in the Court Guide; and who'd think
me an impertinent old fellow, if I chucked their little
ones under the chin, on meeting them in my morning's
walk!”
Mrs. Hamlyn uttered a civil sort of half-dissentient
murmur.
ture,
“ And when evening draws on, and my house is shut
in for the night,” resumed the Colonel, “ with nobody
but poor Pincher and me to keep each other company, I
sometimes ask myself what crime I've committed to be
thus condemned to a solitary cell; and whether I'm really
at home, and really in the Old England that calls itself
so hospitable !"
“You are surely dwelling on the dark side of the pic.
my
dear sir!" said Mrs. Hamlyn.
"I wish you'd show me the bright one. Such desperate
long evenings ! Spin out one's dinner and one's claret as
one will, they can't last for ever; and though Johnston

a shame to rouse poor Goody Johnston out of her arm-

for half an hour's gossip or whist at my club, haven't
the heart to do it, and that's the truth.”
“But why not spend your evenings with us ?" de-
manded Mrs. Hamlyn, in all sincerity.
Why so I do, as often as my conscience will allow.

poor Hamlyn would far rather
enjoy his leisure undisturbed, with his wife and family,
than be taken up at backgammon, night after night, by
a tiresome old fellow, always pumping him for news, and

with none to offer in return. Why, my dear ma'am! even
Quiddle, the apot'cary, shirks me, when I lay an embargo
on him more than twice a week! Though I make the
most of my rheumatics, purely to secure half an hour's
chit-chat with him, of an afternoon,—when I try to coax
him into stopping dinner, forsooth, he puts on a demure,
family-man-ish sort of face, and tells me, 'Mrs. Q. is ex-
pecting him at home!!"
Mrs. Hamlyn inclined her face closer over her work
to conceal an involuntary smile at this desolate picture
of the situation of a man of fifteen thousand a year,
thrown over by an uxorious apothecary. But scarcely
had the smile arisen, when it subsided to sadness. Weil
did she remember the time when, on her translation from
her own cheerful home to the cold formal household of
the banker in Cavendish Square, she felt nearly as lonely
as the old Indian. Habit had become second nature to
her. She was now tamed down into apathy, by the
long, uneventful mornings, and taciturn tête-à-têtes,
completing the day; and though few women would have
more enjoyed unrestrained intercourse with her children,
she had long resigned herself to the methodical order im-
posed by the banker, of seeing them at stated periods
decreed by the wisdom of the head-nurse and governess,
so as not to interfere with the clockwork arrangements
of their meals, exercise, and education. For the rigid
man of business, accustomed to regard regularity as the
mainspring of affairs, carried his system of arithmetical,
exactitude into all the details of private life. Profound
sympathy arose accordingly in the bosom of Mrs. Hamlyn,
as she reflected how thoroughly she had subdued her im-
pulses of feeling, and silenced her own repinings; while
the grey-headed man before her, though his threescore
years were accomplished, had his lesson yet to learn.
“I cannot help fearing, my dear sir," she observed, at
the close of a few moments' silence, “that you have been
precipitate in settling in town, In the country, the bond
of good neighbourship still subsists. In the country, you
would have found interests in your property to occupy
your time. I sadly fear you will never be quite happy
in town.”

Colonel Hamilton ;—“though to be sure, in Indy, the
thing I used to dread most for

Mine has been a curious life. I married for
love. I'll tell you the whole story some day or another,
when I'm in better spirits,-suffice it now that I married
for love. Nothing very wonderful in that, you'll say;
but you may perhaps account it worth mention that
thirty years of wedded life didn't lessen the mutual affec-
tion which first instigated the imprudence. Mary and
I had but one head and heart between us. We lived in
a remote district, wholly out of reach of society, and so
never fretted after it, or anything else. No little morti-
fications or heart-burnings, to create unkind feelings on
either side; no meddlesome friends to make mischief;
nobody to confide in but each other; nobody to dress

other. Life lay plain and straight afore us.

could, that we might return to our native country, and

We had four-poor things !—who were packed off to
Europe to be reared and edicated, which was our only
trouble. But there was no remedy, and people soon
reconcile themselves to what is irremediable. Mary and
I loved each other only the more when thus left alone to-
gether. Our two girls died young: one of 'em on her
passage home; the other, a year or two afterwards. But
the boys throve and prospered ; and a great joy it was to
their mother and me to watch the progress of the fortune
which, some day or other, was to make us all happy and
comfortable together. I had a fine appointment. In
those days, ma'am, the pagoda-tree hadn't been shaken
too roughly; and there were still ways and means
whereby an honest man might make a princely fortune
in Indy, and Indy none the worse for't. I had the roads
and tanks of a whole district to create; and was lucky
enough to create myself, at the same time, a prime
favourite with the Rajah.

“ Like an ass as I was, however, the first hundred
thousand pounds I had the luck to scrape together, I
deposited with a company of native merchants; and
when Mrs. Hamilton and I, moderate in our desires,
determined to come home and rejoin our children, these
fellows, though not in a state of insolvency, were so
situated, that to realize my funds was impossible. So I
was even forced to stay and look after them. Fortunately,
my roads and tanks wanted looking after too. By way
of compensation, the Rajah doubled my salary from the
company, and so my fortune went on increasing and in-
creasing, and as the appetite for money is said to increase
by what it feeds on, we only grew the more sparing for
growing richer. By this time I'd opened an account
with my friend Hamlyn, who strongly advised my
remaining on the spot to mount guard over my coffee-
coloured debtors. And why not? Mary and I were as
happy together as the day was long."
"And while your sons remained at school, even in
England, you could have enjoyed little of their society,"
interposed Mrs. Hamlyn.
“The voyage home, too, was a serious matter in those
days; so having determined to stay in Indy, so long as
there was any necessity for return, we dawdled on from
year to year, happy in ourselves, and still happier in the
thought of settling in our old age in our native country,
in the bosom of our family,—see the boys prosper in their
turn, marry, and settle. But what a selfish old blockhead
I am, to trouble you with all these details, in which you
can take no manner of interest !"--cried the old man,
suddenly checking himself as a warm tear, stealing down
his face, rendered him painfully conscious of the presence
of his companion.
“Go on, I entreat you," faltered Mrs. Hamlyn, in a
tone of unfeigned interest and compassion.
“The rest, my dear good lady, you know pretty well as
near as myself,” resumed the Colonel. “You knew my
poor sons. When they were schoolboys-when Jack was
at Eton, and Bob at Haileybury, they used to write us
word of the happy holidays they enjoyed at Dean Park.
Thanks to you and Hamlyn, the poor fellows never felt

the want of a home. When they grew to man's
estate, Bob, instead of accepting the fine appointment
offered me for him by the Company, chose to go into the
army. But Jack-poor Jack !--- finding I had determined
to remain in exile half a dozen years longer, resolved' to
come out to Indy, (bless him for the thought!) to have
a sight of his old father and mother. He never did see
’em, ma'am! The unfortunate vessel"
Spare yourself, my dear sir!" interrupted Mrs.
Hamlyn. “The fate of poor dear John Hamilton was as
deeply deplored by our fireside as by your own."
"Poor Iad !—poor lad!—To judge by his letters, as fine
a fellow as ever breathed God's air. His mother never
held up her head again. She survived for years, but
up her head again after the fatal news reached
His brother"
“ His brother married—”
“Ay—but not till we'd committed the fatal mistake of
fretting his heart and health out, by opposition to his
marriage. In that, my friend Hamlyn was a wee bit to
blame. Hamlyn seemed to think that it was because I
had yielded at a word to Robert's whim about the
army,
he now presumed on his influence to threaten me with a
foolish marriage. As if parents, thousands of miles off,
have any right to control the affections of an only son,
grown to man's estate, and the best judge of his own
taste and inclinations! But all that might have been
predicted came to pass. Though at first as positive as a
Turk, I gave way the moment I heard the boy's health
was failing. Too late, my dear madam, too late,—too
late! He married, (as you know, for you were present, I
fancy, at the wedding,) and went straight to Italy, and
died within the year. If he had only left a child to com-
fort his parents in their old age-if he had only left a
child! Well, ma'am,—the moment the news of his sudden
death reached us, we resolved to hurry home;-an odd
fancy, you'll think, just then,-when we had nothing left
to care for in England. But our only object had been to
lay by a fortune for the boys. Both were gone! What
or who was there now left in the world, to induce us to
remain estranged from our native country ? Mary was

a confirmed invalid; but I cheered her up with hopes
that native air would restore her-that there were bright
days in store for us yet. Poor Mary! She smiled, and
pretended to believe me, not liking to seem to reproach
me for having occasioned the death of her son!”
“I well remember receiving the letter from Mrs.
Hamilton, announcing her return,” said Mrs. Hamlyn, in
a low voice, “and thanking me for a lock of her son's
hair. Her only desire in this world, she said, was to be
laid beside him in the grave.”'
“Did she say that?” cried the old man, wiping his
eyes. “Good creature! She never expressed the wish
to me; feeling, I dare say, that it was fated to be un-
gratified! Her passage home was taken, however; and,
thanks to Johnston and his wife, every comfort provided.
But it wouldn't do. The word had
gone forth--God
had called her to himself!"
“I laid her in the grave,” resumed Colonel Hamilton,
in a voice broken by sobs. “My companion for thirty
years,—my companion, I may say, in the wilderness,
with whom I had never exchanged one angry word or
resentful feeling! Poor Mary! My grief for her was very
different from what I had felt for the boys. That she
had been there to alleviate! But everything went with
her-everything-everything !"
Mrs. Hamlyn respected in silence the grief of the good
old man. At length, she ventured to congratulate him
on having been able, at a crisis so grievous, to turn his
back on the scene of his trials.
“Your afflictions would have been doubly painful,”
said she, “had circumstances compelled you to remain in
India.”
“I don't know, I often think otherwise," was his
reply. “It seemed like losing sight of all my happier
recollections, to turn my back on the place where we
had abided together. The old house and gardens at
Ghazerapore were full of her. There had our children
been born to us —there had I wiped the last moisture
from her face. My poor dear wife! The natives adored
her ; she was a second providence in the village. Here,
no one ever heard her name. I spoke of her one day to

THE BANKERS WIFE;
Quiddle,--spoke of her as I am speaking now,--and the
jackass told me I was low, and advised a dose of sal-
volatile! However, 'twas by her express desire I has-
tened home.
“You owe it to yourself and others,' said poor Mrs.
Hamilton, on her death-bed, 'to extend your sphere of
usefulness to the best of your means.
We have lived,
my dear husband, solely for ourselves and our children
and Heaven seems to have visited this upon us a fault.
You are rich--you possess the means of doing good.
Go home. Call around you those who are left, and pro-
mote their happiness, and your own. Robert's widow
has claims upon you. The Hamlyns, who were parents
to your children, have claims upon you. Return to
England, therefore, my dear, dear Hamilton, and fulfil
the excellent purposes of your kindly nature !!
“ At first, compliance with her parting injunctions
appeared impossible," resumed the old man, after a pause
of deep emotion; "and I hoped to be spared the pain of
resisting, for the first time, a wish of my wife's, by follow-
ing her to the grave. But people seldom die of grief, I
fancy. The Almighty proportions our trials to our
strength. It is in the order of nature that we survive
many whom we love, and become consoled for their loss.
Providence knows best!
“Before the end of the year, I embarked for England.
I have not been two years a widower, yet already I enter-
tain hopes of making my old age, if not all that I once
hoped and expected, at least happy and cheerful with
the happiness and cheerfulness of others !"
May your prospects be fully realized !” ejaculated
Mrs. Hamlyn, her countenance bearing tokens of deep
sympathy in the emotions of her honest-hearted friend.
“ You say right, Colonel Hamilton! Providence knows
best. Very, very few among us are fated to be happy in
the way we should have pointed out in early youth as
the path of happiness; yet scarcely a human being
but-
She paused. At that moment, the drawing-room door
was slowly opened ; and the rising colour on her cheek
and words suspended on her lips denoted Mrs. Hamlyn's

instantaneous recognition of the noiseless approach of her
husband.
Colonel Hamilton, without rising from the arm-chair
beside the fire, where he felt himself so thoroughly at
home, extended his hand in cordial greeting to his friend
Hamlyn, the banker.
CHAPTER II.
“Lord Angelo is precise, -scarcely confesses
His appetite is more to bread than stone."-SHAKSPEARE,
RICHARD HAMLYN was what is called a most excellent
man -a man generally esteemed and respected,—a man
eminently qualified to figure to advantage on a tombstone;
had never been suspected of a vice or accused of a failing.
Not a servant in his establishment most of whom had
lived with him for years, could complain of having seen
his countenance disturbed by anger, or heard his voice
raised by excitement.
Such, however, was the force of his calm and immutable
regularity, that the most fiery domestic tyrant could not
have attained a more absolute sway in his own family.
His wife knew him to be averse to all display of sensibi-
lity; his children were early taught that he detested
noise; and the banker's house was, consequently, charac-
terized by the silence, coldness, and dulness of the Great
Pyramid.
Impossible to see a better regulated establishment !
All went as if by Clockwork, or steam. Whether the
perfection of its household management arose from
perseverance in method, or readiness of means, the
result was admirable. Had any friend of Hamlyn's,
after an absence of many years in the far East or far
West, thought proper to drop in to dinner in Cavendish
Square, or volunteer a visit to Dean Park, he might have
been as certain of the hour and minute to arrive, the
number of dishes on the table and servants in attendance,
the disposition of the salvers on the sideboard and decan-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
ters on the board, as though he had only vacated his seat
in the dining-room the preceding day. But, on the other
hand, people of Richard Hamlyn's class seldom possess a
friend sufficiently friendly to drop in to dinner, or volun-
teer a visit in the country.
His wife, when, at eighteen, in all her bloom of beauty
and cheerfulness of spirit, she accepted the proposals of
a handsome young man with whom she had danced
through the London season, certainly expected a very
different personage in the gay son of a wealthy banker,
on whom her parents were so eager to bestow her hand.
But scarcely a year after their marriage, the death of the
elder Hamlyn, while it assigned independence to the
young couple, threw the business of the family and the
firmi so completely into the hands of the bridegroom, as
to sober him at once into a man of business.
From that moment, Mrs. Hamlyn lost sight of her
husband in the banker and executor; and as her mother-
in-law continued till her death some years afterwards to
reside with them in Cavendish Square and at Dean Park,
Richard Hamlyn had no scruple about leaving his wife
alone, and devoting himself exclusively to business.
In the city he thenceforth lived and moved and had his
being. His dreams were of clerkly desks,-his visions,
of loans and Exchequer bills; and when, at the end of
the week, he hurried down in summer into the country,
or at the close of the day in winter retired to his London
fireside, he arrived there so jaded in spirits by the pres-
sure of his arduous concerns, that it was clear his idea of
domestic happiness must consist in tranquillity. The
greatest proof of kindness his wife could show him, was
to leave him silent and alone.
It is surprising how readily the tact of a woman attached
to her duties suggests the surest method of recom-
mending herself to the affections of her husband. The
merry, thoughtless Sophia soon saw that, to endear her-
self to the man of business, she must offer no obstruction
to the methodical serenity of one who had not leisure for
demonstrations of sensibility, or the frivolous pastimes of
life. . Punctual and acquiescent, she must receive him
ever with a smile,-seldom with a laugh. By degrees,

21
the smile subsided into a thoughtful gravity still more
acceptable. At thirty, Mrs. Hamlyn had sunk into a
mild, calm, silent woman, without a vestige of the buoyancy
of youth ; and the banker into a stiff, reserved man of
business, -after the fashion of most conjugal couples in
the money-getting classes of Great Britain.
Had this sobriety of deportment been a matter of
calculation, it could not have prospered better! Richard
Hamlyn was the very mirror of bankers,—the model-
man of Lombard Street! His father's city contem-
poraries nodded their heads approvingly while re-
marking that Richard was a steady, exemplary young
man,--his wife a very prudent young woman; and though
their household and modes of life were established on a
footing of almost aristocratic liberality, no one was dis-
posed to find fault. So capital was young Hamlyn's
management, that even the most captious of his consti-
tuents was fain to admit that the far-sighted financier of
Lombard Street and Dean Park was able to make half a
sovereign go as far as a guinea.
Children meanwhile had been born to the prosperous
couple; and the same system of discipline which had
converted the gay Sophia Harrington into a domestic
machine, rendered the little Hamlyns the mildest and
dullest children in the world. Untaught by the example
of others to be capricious or noisy, (for the faults of
children are far more imitative than grown-up people are
apt to allow,) they appeared to be as much under the
control of the omnipotent banker as any other of his
ciphers.
This unlimited submission on the part of those about
him, exercised by degrees an evil influence on the cha-
racter of Richard Hamlyn. In his own quiet way, he
was as absolute as the Sultan. He did not understand
the slightest opposition to his veto; and though, having
succeeded his father in the representation of the neigh-
bouring borough of Barthorpe, his opinions commanded
the respect of the House of Commons on all questions
of commercial or financial interest, Hamlyn, the banker,
had more than once committed himself in parliament, by
outbursts of petulance singularly at variance with the

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
gentle tenor of his private life. In his country neigh-
bourhood, on the other hand, he was respected as a just
landlord and hospitable neighbour; not spending enough
of his time in Warwickshire to nullify the good report of
the county by the taciturn reserve of his deportment.
By degrees, indeed, his temper afforded evidence in
private life of the irritating stress of an anxious vocation.
But Mrs. Hamlyn had either schooled herself into such
apathy as to remain unconscious of the change; or was
too good a woman to avow, even to herself, that she
was aware of the despotic harshness of the father of her
children. The concealment was easy. Like the majo-
rity of his sex, he was never arbitrary with his wife,
unless when they were alone.
“What were you and Colonel Hamilton discussing to-
day, that I found
you both so agitated when I came in?”
demanded he of his wife, as they awaited together in the
drawing-room the announcement of dinner, on the day in
question.
“He was simply describing to me the supreme happi-
ness of his wedded life. Mrs. Hamilton and the old
gentleman appear to have been a singularly united
couple."
“ All couples are said to have been singularly united,
as soon as either husband or wife is in the grave,”.
replied the banker, coldly. “The Hamiltons lived very
well together, or their téte-à-tête in an obscure district in
India would have been insupportable. It was their best
policy to agree.”
“ People do not always act from policy," was the mild
remonstrance of Mrs. Hamlyn. “Their dispositions were
amiable and well assorted."
“Their means ample, and their understanding narrow!"
added the banker.
“So much the better for their happiness! They seem
to have entertained no injurious ambitions," observed his
wife.
Hamlyn, who was standing magisterially on the rug,
with his back to the fire, fixed his eyes inquiringly upon
her face. But the countenance of Sophia, though open,
was sometimes difficult to decipher. The early habit of

23
repressing her emotions into the equanimity of the
Hamlyn temperament, imparted a look of vagueness and
absence to her eyes. Even while uttering a simple answer
to a simple question, her thoughts often appeared to be
wandering; and when silent, it was impossible to surmise
from her countenance the nature of her reveries.
“ Colonel Hamilton must have enlarged unconscion-
ably on the merits of his late wife," resumed the banker,
still scrutinizing the face of his companion; “for Ram-
say
told me when I came in, he had been sitting with you
more than an hour."
“ Was it so long ? Poor old man!-his sole comfort
consists in his visits here," replied Mrs. Hamlyn. “I
wish the boys were in town, to enliven him with their
society. But between Walter's hunting, and Henry's
Italian tour, we are left this winter quite alone !"
“What possible charm could the society of young men
of their
age
have for an old fellow like Hamilton ? »
“But since you have no leisure to bestow upon him ?”
“He bestows his leisure upon you. My house is always
open
to him."
“ Yet you seem surprised he should have been sitting
here so long this morning ?"
Again did Richard Hamlyn fix his eyes inquiringly on
the face of his wife. But he read there no indication of
an unusual bitterness of retort.
"I fear he is getting sadly weary of London," added
she, with her customary gentleness. “The solitude of a
crowded city, where he knows nobody, oppresses him; and
Quiddle assures him that all his indigestion arises from
being hypped, and recommends Brighton or Cheltenham.
Colonel Hamilton is himself of opinion that London dis-
agrees with him.”
“ Absurd! London is one of the most salubrious spots
in the world. Portland Place lies very high, and stands
upon gravel.”
“ His spirits, rather than his health, appear affected.”
“Do you mean to say, Sophia, that London is not a suffi-
ciently cheerful residence for a man who has been living
contentedly, for the last forty years, tête-à-téte with a vale-
tudinarian wife, in a colony of Gentoos?”

very reason of his requiring a livelier residence in
his old age. I almost agree with him," added Mrs. Ham-
lyn," that he would be happier in the country.”
“In short, you have been advising him to settle at
Brighton or Cheltenham, where a man of his sort will be
instantly surrounded by toadies, to the serious detriment
of our children.”
I do not call Brighton or Cheltenham the country.
The utmost I suggested was, that he would have been hap-
pier with us this winter at Dean Park !"
"I told you before, that Hamilton has important busi-
ness in Leadenhall Street!”
“ Which will be settled in a few months. If, therefore,
instead of a house in Portland Place, he had purchased
Burlington Manor"
“You might as well say, if he had purchased the Hyde,
or Dean Park! Burlington Manor is not on sale!"
“Yet surely you mentioned the other night,” Mrs.
Hamlyn paused. It suddenly occurred to her that her
husband might not choose to be reminded of what he had
mentioned the other night. But she had advanced too far
to recede. The banker's curiosity was excited. She was
compelled to rise and explain.
“ You hinted,” resumed his wife, in obedience to his
commands, “that Lady Burlington had resolved against
living at the Manor."
" I certainly said that she was apprehensive of the large
expenses such a residence must entail on the minor's
estate.”
“ At all events, you seemed of opinion that, before
long, the whole place might possibly be brought to the
hammer !”
Mr. Hamlyn had indeed uttered some such denuncia-
tion; but merely in the way of menace against Lady
Burlington, who occasionally saw fit to have a will of her
own, as co-executrix of her husband, and guardian of her
He now seemed struck by a sudden inspiration ;
and was about to utter some trivial remark by way of dis-
tracting the attention of his wife from the subject, when
Ramsay, his solemn butler, entered with a mysterious air,
to announce dinner. It was the rule of the house to avoid,

during the attendance of the servants at meal-times, all
cɔnversation involving the mention of proper names ;
and nothing, consequently, could be more bald and
disjointed than the dinner-table chat of the Hamlyn
family.
On returning to the drawing-room after dinner, the
same prohibitory regulations were in force, in deference
to the presence of the young ladies and their governess,
who made their appearance for tea. Few, therefore, and
brief were the moments allotted to conjugal confidence by
the banker; who, on points where it was his pleasure to
maintain reserve, understood how to frustrate curiosity by
an imperturbable calmness, more effective than the most
intemperate wrath of other men.
The experience of four-and-twenty years, however, ena-
bled his wife to form tolerably correct inferences even
from his silence; and her interpretation of a few broken
words and elevations of the eyebrow prevented her being
much surprised, when, about a month afterwards, the mo-
ment that February put forth its deceptive mildness,
Colonel Hamilton announced one morning to Lydia and
her sister that he was about to accompany their father
for a day or two to Dean Park.
Any message to your pony, Miss Lydia, my dear?"
said the old man, to the elder girl, (towards whom he had
a partial leaning, from the circumstance of his son Jack
having been staying, a convalescent child from school, at
Dean Park, at the moment of her birth, and enlarged
mightily in his letters to his mother on the beauty of the
babe,) "any message to the lambs and primroses on Valen-
tine's day ?”
Going to dear Dean? How provoking! You will
see the place to such disadvantage at this time of year!"
cried Lydia. “And I was so in hopes that at your
first
visit I should be there to show you
She paused. The warm-hearted girl hesitated about
alluding to the flower-garden made for her, in her happier
childhood, by her patrons, the young Hamiltons.
"Don't fret yourself, my dear young lady!" cried Colonel
Hamilton. "I shall most likely see the place in all its
perfection before I die; ay, and you may chance to see me

there, oftener than you care for. However, mum's the
word !-Hamlyn's such a cautious fellow, that he won't
let me blab, even about my own affairs.”
Already, Mrs. Hamlyn foresaw the result of this visit.
Within a week, the papers were in progress
whose signa-
ture was to assign Burlington Manor for a term of years
to the ex-Colonel of Ghazerapore.
The measure, if accomplished solely at the suggestion of
the worldly-wise man in whose hands he was little more
than a puppet, was one Colonel Hamilton was far less
likely to repent than his own precipitate purchase in
Portland Place; though even that evil had been remedied
by the intervention of the banker; who contrived to per-
suade a young Irish Baronet (just come into his fortune,
and whom an extensive county in Ireland judged of years
of sufficient discretion to represent it in parliament) that
Portland Place was an agreeable distance from the
House of Commons, and six hundred a-year a moderate
rent.
“ And so you see, my dear lady,” observed Colonel
Hamilton, on announcing the good news in Cavendish
Square, "my friend Hamlyn's put me in the way of being
comfortable; found me a house, and found me a tenant.
With a degree of inconsistency I might blush for, if there
were any one but Pincher to admire my blushes, I've let
my house to a stranger, and shall reside for the rest of
my days under a stranger's roof. I'd rather have pur-
chased-much rather have purchased. At my time o'
life, to sign a lease for twenty-one years, appears
like
tempting Providence. But within fifty miles of Dean,
not a place to be had; and the idea of going further away
from you all would have broken my old heart. So you
must even make up your minds to put up with me.
We're now next door neighbours. Our park-gates stand
cheek by jowl, as it were; and we might almost shake
hands over the paling !"
“We used to see a great deal of the Burlingtons," re-
plied Mrs. Hamlyn, with a saddened eye. “In poor Sir
Roger's lifetime, not a day passed without our meeting.
As it proved impossible for Lady Burlington to keep up
the place during her son's minority, I always preferred

its remaining unoccupied to seeing a stranger in the room
of my friend; little expecting ever to find a tenant in
yourself. You are nearly the only person I could have
been pleased to welcome to the haunts of my lost friends.”
“Thank ye, thank ye!" cried the Colonel. “There's
one comfort in talking to you. One knows you mean
what you say. Otherwise, I should be afraid you were
already murmuring in the depths of your heart, Shall I
never get rid of this old man of the sea ? Is he always
to be strapped to my shoulders ?'”
“I am sure, Colonel Hamilton, you were never afraid
of an unkind word or thought from mamma!” interposed
Lydia, almost angrily.
“ At all events, I fancy I shall have you among the
grumblers,” replied the old man, turning laughingly to-
wards her; for
my friend Hamlyn has decided that

season,

impending over them.

Miss Hamlyn, shrugging her shoulders. “Harriet and
I want only to get out of this smoky town, to our ponies
and flower-gardens."
“I wish ye both joy, then! for, as I was just going to
tell ye, you are all to be packed off, bag and baggage,
into Warwickshire, early in May."
“This is good news, indeed!” exclaimed Mrs. Hamlyn;
who, taking little pleasure in the gay world previous to
the introduction of her daughter into society, experienced
a happy emancipation at Dean Park from the methodical
restrictions imposed by the head of the family. Though
the same school-hours were observed as in town, she
enjoyed the company of the girls unmolested in her drives
and walks in their intervals of recreation.

for in my new seat is watching over the wall for the

of being managed by my servants, I showed 'em I was
my own master; and hurried the lawyers all the more
with the
papers, the more they grumbled. I shall soon
teach 'em how merry we can make the country by cheer-
ful hearts and open housekeeping. And by the way, my
dear ma'am," continued the exulting old gentleman, ad-
dressing Mrs. Hamlyn, “as I find you're in correspond-
ence with this Lady Burlington, (who must be fretting
her
poor heart sadly, I should think, to be forced to give
up her beautiful place,) I wish you'd just tell her, as such
matters don't read so well in a six-and-eight-penny letter,
among the whereases and forasmuches of the lawyers,
that if there's any poor folks in the village she holds to
having cared for, or any favourite plants in the hot-
houses she'd like to give to a friend, she has only to send
me a hint, and her will's as good as done. I saw a fine
Newfoundland dog skulking about the offices as though
he'd been used to be petted, and had lost a friend-at
whom Pincher chose to set up his ears 'cause I patted
him on the head."
“Poor Carlo!" murmured Lydia, “Sir Roger's old
favourite! he must, indeed, miss Lady Burlington.”
“Well, mind and tell her he sha’n't be tied up,
but
have the run of the place. Carlo shall still find himself
at home.”
“He was too cumbersome a fellow-traveller to take
with her and the children to Naples,” observed Mrs.
Hamlyn. “I should have been glad to give him a home
at Dean, and the mare too-Lady Burlington's favourite
mare—but Mr. Hamlyn was not very kindly disposed
towards her at the moment of her departure, and I did
not dare propose it. I fancy Lady Burlington interfered
too much with his arrangements as executor."
“That's to say, I suppose, she thought what was her
son's was hers, and what was hers was her own. The
two best friends that ever were born seldom remain so
when there's pounds, shillings, and pence to be settled
between 'em. Joseph's brethren sold him into slavery;
and there's many a brother left in the world who'd drive
the same bargain. However, just mention, my dear
ma'am, in your next letter, that the mare shall have a

for her; and, but for Pincher's jealousy, Carlo will have
his own way. I recollect what a twinge it gave my heart
to leave behind at Ghazerapore a poor dromedary that
worked the well in the garden, lest it should be ill-used
after leaving its master and mistress. I made up my
mind to shoot it, but my hand failed.”
Mrs. Hamlyn answered warmly for the gratitude of her
absent friend; and six weeks afterwards, on her arrival
at Dean Park, had the satisfaction of finding her new
neighbour in the exercise of all his good intentions, and
the enjoyment of more than his expected pleasures.
Moreover, as it was the object of the banker to render
Colonel Hamilton as contented as possible in his new
residence, he had issued papal indulgences to his family,
in accordance with the old gentleman's wishes, entitling
his daughters to accompany their mother whenever
she dined at Burlington Manor; besides letters of dis-
pensation to Miss Creswell, the governess, to visit her
friends in Ireland for the remainder of the summer-
her first leave of absence during ten years' tuition in the
family.

a home !" cried the old soldier, the first time he welcomed
his Dean Park friends to his hospitable board, to meet
the Vicar of Ovington and his wife. very different

where people care for nothing but to have it said they

service of plate than their neighbours! This is the
England I used to dream of in Indy-green, and fresh,
and sociable!”
“A pleasant refreshment, certainly, sir, to eyes long
wearied by the parched sands and scanty foliage of the
East,” observed Dr. Markham, surprised at such warm
enthusiasm on the part of an old gentleman of sixty-five;
a bosom friend, moreover, of his saturnine patron, the
banker.
“Ay, and a still greater relief, after being sent gravel-
grinding, day after day, for exercise, among a parcel of
gaudy hussies in Hyde Park !" retorted the Colonel.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;

“ Just turn round your head, Doctor, and look at the
deer grouped yonder under the beech trees, and the
gleams of sunshine flung through the drooping branches
on the rich grass! Lydia, child! I won't have you laugh
at the ecstasies of your old friend. I dare say you'll be
calling me Peter Pastoral by and by. You never heard
the Burlingtons, may be, run on in praise of the place
'cause in them 'twould have been ostentation. But my
raptures are simply an expression of gratitude to GOD
for having secured to the old, useless hulk, after the storms
and breakers of life, safe anchorage in a pleasant harbour
at last!"
In compliance with a wish expressed by the Hamlyn
girls, the Colonel ordered coffee to be served in a fine
conservatory built by the late Sir Roger in the centre of
the flower-garden, to which he was projecting the addi-
tion of an aviary for his Bengalees; and what a relief to
the whole party, after the formalities of Dean Park, was
that unceremonious evening-the fragrance of the gardens
enhanced by a gentle dew, and their gorgeous colours
subdued by the clear-obscure of a midsummer twilight!
“Is not this pleasant and sociable, Dr. Markham ?”
exclaimed the happy Lydia, in all the joy of schoolroom
emancipation. We never do anything of the kind at
home. Papa so much dislikes having things displaced.”
“Ay, ay!” interrupted the Colonel, “all that sort of
household subordination's a capital thing for a family-
man like my friend Hamlyn. But discipline would be
out of place in an establishment with an old Indian at
its head, accustomed to take things as he finds ’em, to
glad to find 'em at all. I like everybody to be free,
easy, and comfortable about me, Pincher and all. 'Live
and let live,' is my motto, or, rather, 'Let live, that you
may deserve to live.?"
Such sentiments received a silent “amen” from the
gentle wife of the banker, and an audible one from the
Vicar of Ovington; who, among the numerous benefits
heaped on his parish by his patron, the banker, began
to conceive that the greatest of all might prove the
hospitable, open-hearted neighbour he had provided for
the Vicarage.

Dr. Markham's prejudices as a low churchman had
always rendered the Roman Catholic baronets of Bur-
lington Manor a stumbling-block in his pastoral way;
and though the judicious liberality of Richard Hamlyn
almost sufficed the needs of the parish, the generous
Hamilton had already shown himself a more apt repre-
sentative of the bounty of Providence, which sendeth its
rain on the just and unjust,-neither assuming with the
poor the severity of a judge, nor, with their pastor, the
pride of a rich man.
Richard Hamlyn was one of those who measure out !
their dole with as many conditions to the naked and
hungry as though they had incurred his charity by a
crime; nor could Dr. Markham disguise from himself
that, after only three months' acquaintance, he was on
a pleasanter footing with Colonel Hamilton than with
the more correctly-spoken neighbour at Dean Park, who
invariably made him feel that the parson and his wife
were invited to dine now and then at the great house, to
"keep up the respectability of the church in the eyes of
the lower classes;” or, in other words, to ensure the
attendance of his servants and labourers at church, where
they were frightened out of picking and stealing the pro-
perty of their betters, and inspired with becoming de-
ference for those in authority over them.
It was a real comfort, therefore, to the heart of the Vicar,
to find himself respected by Colonel Hamilton as a privi-
leged expositor of the truths of the Gospel; and invited
to his table as a neighbour and gentlemanly companion,
rather than as a professional man.
Dr. Markham was, however, too well aware of Mrs.
Hamlyn's subordinate importance in the family, to attri-
bute to her any portion of the overweening purse-pride
of Dean Park.
“It must be many years, madam,” said he, respectfully
addressing her, as they sat overlooking the flower-beds
from the open doors of the conservatory, "since you
enjoyed the sight of your own roses in bloom ? This is
the first summer I remember you to have spent in War-
wickshire. I often observe to Mrs. Markham, that, while
the owners of the three finest seats in the neighbourhood

remain pent in the stifting metropolis, she and I-
-a poor
parson and his wife--- monopolize the enjoyment of their
beauties!”
“You do not, I hope, grudge my having at length
come to share them with you ?” inquired Mrs. Hamlyn,
with a smile. “It has always consoled me for my con-
finement in London to know that the flowers and shrub-
beries at Dean were at least enjoyed by those who fill
my place so kindly during my absence, in duties where it
were otherwise difficult indeed to find a representative!”
Mrs. Markham, a nervous little woman who could
never be encouraged out of her village timidity by the
civilities of the Manor or Dean Park, stammered some-
thing nearly unintelligible about her delight in being
the dispenser of Mrs. Hamlyn’s benevolence.
“But what the deuce do you mean by the three finest
seats in the country, my dear Doctor ?”—suddenly inter-
rupted Colonel Hamilton.
"I fancy you have not yet visited the Hyde; which,
begging yours and Mrs. Hamlyn's pardon, is the finest
place within twenty miles round,” replied the Vicar.
“The Hyde-the Hyde? Never even heard of it,"
cried Colonel Hamilton. “I must really get a map of
the county, to hang up in my hall!"
Surely you remember the fine woods I pointed out
to you as Lord Vernon's, the day we drove over together
from Braxham Heath ?” inquired Mrs. Hamlyn.
“ To be sure I do! But how was I to guess they
belonged to a family-seat ?”
“The Braxham woods clothe a fine acclivity. The
Hyde, like most old houses, lies at the foot," said the
Vicar in explanation.
“ Gad! I'm glad to hear of more neighbours than I
counted on!” cried the social old gentleman.
more the merrier, the more the merrier, especially if I
persist in my intention of spending my winters in the
country.
Let me see. The Manor makes

fourteen
spare beds; and besides ourselves," he continued, glancing
at the whole party, but addressing Mrs. Hamlyn, “there's
your two sons, who I hope will be here at Christmas.
Old Gratwycke of Gratwycke House tells me he is too

old to sleep out of his own house. But tell me, pray,
who is it lives at The Hyde ?”
"I might also answer, no one,” replied Dr. Markham :
"iso little advantage does the neighbourhood derive from
the society of Lord Vernon's family. His lordship’s
principal seat is in Northumberland ; and since the pre-
sent peer came to his title, he has only visited Warwick-
shire once or twice, avowedly to hunt with the Duke of
Elvaston's hounds, whose best coverts' lie' on this side
the county."
“The Vernons associate very little with their country
neighbours," added Mrs. Hamlyn; “which we regret the
less, as the ford at Braxham is unpleasant enough in
winter, when they are usually here; and to go round by
Barsthorpe bridge, doubles the distance."
The parson's wife could scarcely sufficiently admire
the fluency with which Mrs. Hamlyn accounted for what
the-lesser thrones and dominions interpreted into the
pride of all the Vernons; whọ presumed upon their length
of pedigree towards the banker, as much as the banker
presumed towards others upon his length of purse.
“In short, these fine folks are not neighbourly!" was
Colonel Hamilton's summary of the case. Well, there's
room enough in the air for high-flyers and low-flyers!
If they can do without us, we must do without them.
I'm surprised, though! "We think a deal of a lord in
Indy, 'cause we seldom have more than one at a' time.
A Phoenix is a Phenix, and a governor-general's a
governor-general. But I fancied that in Lon'on, where
there's a whole House full of 'em, these great lords thought
less of themselves.”
"We scarcely know what the Vernons think of them.
selves, for they are almost strangers in the county,"
observed Mrs. Hamlyn. “They have not been here
these two years."
“If there's nobody at the Hyde, then, why shouldn't
I go and indulge myself with a peep at the place ?” cried
Colonel Hamilton.
“I think you would perhaps be more, pleased with
Ormeau," said Mrs. Hamlyn, timidly!
“But Ormeau is out of distance. One can't get fron?

over in
Burlington to the Duke of Elvaston’s without post-
horses," interposed the Vicar.
“And my chief object is the drive," cried Colonel
Hamilton. The first cool day, Doctor, suppose we go
my phaeton ?”
The Vicar readily acquiesced. The plan suited all
parties. Between the Vernons and the Hamlyns there
existed a coldness which, the fathers of both having been
friends, might be considered enmity; and, even during
the absence of the family, Mrs. Hamlyn was not fond of
appearing an intruder at the Hyde. It was not a regular
show-place; i.e. one of those great houses whose great
lords sanction their housekeeper in exhibiting their state
apartments and pictures to strangers, on the mulct of a
piece of gold. But on inscribing their names in a book
(kept for the purpose of recording these tributes to the
family vanity) the country neighbours were privileged ;
and one of the pragmaticalities of Richard Hamlyn was
a dislike to have his patronymic figure in the register of
his haughty neighbour more than a certain number of
times in the year, when forced to show off the lions of
the Dean Park neighbourhood to visitors of mark and
distinction. Whenever a Countess was his inmate, he
took care to parade her to the Hyde, uniting the name
of her ladyship by a bracket with those of “Mr. and
Mrs. Hamlyn, of Dean Park.” But his wife was suffi-
ciently cognizant of his weaknesses to suspect that he
would not wish to appear there as the bear-leader of a
new comer into the county.
Moreover, there had been of late election-feuds between
the banker and Lord Vernon; a member of whose family
was usually the Whig representative of the county, while
Hamlyn figured in Parliament as the Tory member for a
neighbouring borough, in which the Vernon interest was
| invariably defeated.
So far from loving his neighbour as himself, Lord
Vernon despised Dean Park as much as Dean Park de-
tested Lord Vernon. According to the Christian custom
of modern times, however, they hated each other in civil
toleration; on that sort of visiting acquaintance which
approaches nearest to the blood-stained and deadly feuds

of the middle ages. They mutually shook hands, as if
caressing a rattle-snake; while the ladies of the two
families presented compliments to each other, or re-
quested the honour of each other's company, or were
each other's “ very sincerely,” as occasion needed.
It was a comfort, therefore, to Mr. Hamlyn when the
Vicar of Ovington consented to act as cicerone to Colonel
Hamilton, in his visit to the stately old mansion of the
Hyde.
CHAPTER III.
It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,
Crown'd by high woodlands where the Druid oak
Stood like Caractacus, in act to rally
His hosts,-with broad arms 'gainst the thunder-stroke;
And from beneath the boughs were seen to sally
The dappled foresters ;---as day awoke,
The branching stag swept down, with all his herd,
To quaff a brook that murmured like a bird.-BYRON.

"By George, my dear Doctor! these people have a wee
bit of excuse for thinking curious old port of themselves,”
cried Colonel Hamilton, when, after crossing Braxham
ferry, and sweeping past a quaint old gothic lodge, his
phaeton entered one of those noble English parks whose
oaks are contemporaries of Queen Bess, and over whose
richly swarded slopes no ploughshare has passed in the
memory of man. Why, this fine avenue must be full
two miles in length!”
“'Tis the finest in England, next to the Long Walk at
Windsor,” replied the Vicar, attempting, as became his
cloth, a quotation from Cowper in honour of avenues,
which his companion pronounced to be deuced fine, and
recollected perfectly in Byron.
“ Is that the house ?” added he, pointing to a venerable
pile of gothic almshouses, indistinctly seen from the road
through openings in a grove of sycamores, whose heavy
foliage seemed to impart additional airiness to their slight
pinnacles.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“The house ?" replied the Vicar, smiling; "if the
owner of the Hyde could only hear you! That is Vernon
College, a charitable endowment of the reign of Edward
VI. A large portion of the Vernon property, in this and
other counties, consists of Abbey lands-grants from the
Crown at the Reformation. It was an act of atonement,
probably, on the part of Henry VIII.’s favourite, John,
Lord Vernon, to bestow this gift upon the
poor, to
repay
the injuries of the Church."
“Or, rather, I suppose,” remonstrated Colonel Hamil-
ton, with ex-ecclesiastical interpretation," the suppression
of monasteries expressly endowed by pious persons for
the entertainment and succour of the indigent and sick
demanded a substitution from the charity of the wealthy
nobility.”
“We will not inquire too curiously into the motives
and conscience of John, Lord Vernon,” cried Dr. Mark-
ham, good-humouredly; "as I fear our sole information
must be derived from his brass effigy in Braxham church.
Suffice it that, from his day to the present, the almshouses
have been admirably kept up. But look !-before you
stands the old Manor House of the Vernons."
Having now reached nearly the end of the avenue,
they were within view of a stately mansion, of Elizabethan
architecture, standing in a spacious court, enclosed with
palisades and gateways of enscrolled iron-work. Ap-
proached from so vast a distance, by a gradually de-
clining avenue, the house, like most ancient mansions,
took the traveller by surprise when its full extent of
frontage was developed before him,
“And Lord Vernon, you say, has a nobler seat than
even this ?” exclaimed Colonel Hamilton, in the sim-
plicity of his admiration.
“ A more cheerful I fancy, as regards neighbour-
hood. Vernon Castle is at no great distance from
Alnwick and Chillingham.”
“And the Hyde at no great distance from Burlington
Manor and Dean Park," added the Colonel. “'Tis as
broad as it's long."
Dr. Markham was, perhaps, of opinion that it was
considerably longer than it was broad; but a spiritual

pastor had no right to enlarge upon the vast distinction
between lordly castles and squirearchical residences like
Dean Park.
“ And you say they reside here only a few weeks in
the
year,
and that all the rest of the time this noble
mansion is untenanted ?” exclaimed Colonel Hamilton,
when, the court-yard gates being opened by a shabby
stable-boy, they drove up to the venerable porch.
Doctor, Doctor! with all the talk one hears against
pluralities in the Church, I wonder when a law will
pass 'gainst plurality of palaces in private families ?
There's a deal to be said, I suppose, both pro and con the
subdivision of inheritance, according to Boney's Code ;
but, by George, if I were in Parliament, nothing should
prevent my getting up and proposing an act compelling
every man, having many sons and many family mansions, to
bequeath 'em a country house apiece, to be happy in, and rid
the country of the nuisance of vagrant younger brothers.”
“The chapter is a wide one to embark in just now;
particularly," added Dr. Markham, “within the gates of
a man, who, in addition to his English seats, has a castle
in Ireland large enough to contain the village of Brax.
ham, which, to my knowledge, he has not visited since he
came to his estate.”
And ere Colonel Hamilton could express his indigna-
tion in reply, the Vicar led the way into the great hall,
where the old housekeeper, in her starched coif and lawn
apron, awaited their approach; with her keys in her
hand, and in her mouth the cut and dry exposition of
the glories of the house of Vernon, a litany of the pomps
and vanities of the Hyde.
All was now paraded in succession, -the grand stair-
case, the Barons' gallery, the golden chamber, the
Gobelin suite, the blue damask, the Holbein room, the
cedar parlour, the chapel, the painted hall; and Colonel
Hamilton's raptures increased at the exhibition of every
chef d'oeuvre displayed by old Mrs. Harkness, with a
becoming sense of its importance—and her own.
Above all, the series of venerable family portraits, and
a thousand curious relics connected with the olden time,
seemed to rejoice his heart, almost as much as though

he had been born a Vernon. This realization of the
past appeared to inspire him, for the first time, with faith
in the existence of the Middle Ages.
“ This is precisely the sort of thing the Yankees envy
us!” cried he, after surveying the Barons' gallery with
delight; "the sort of thing that secures old England
against the hubbub of a commonwealth !"
" A link in the chain of the constitution, which, by
keeping the vassal faithful, renders the noble loyal,"
added the Doctor, in a phrase so antithetical, that it
sounded replete with meaning.
“I can't find it in my heart to forgive the man who
owns such a place," added the Colonel enthusiastically,
“for choosing to live elsewhere."
The old housekeeper smoothed down her apron; but
did not smooth her ruffled brows, at hearing the Right
Honourable Lord Vernon apostrophized as “a man."
Though the name inscribed by her blunt visitor in the
book, and Colonel Hamilton's reputation in the neigh-
bourhood for liberality, prepared her for a nabob's fee at
parting, and to be patient under any extent of insult or
injury in the interim, her wrath nearly exploded on
hearing him enlarge to his reverend companion upon
the dignity and interest of the Hyde, but the vast
superiority of Burlington Manor.
* I should have been moped to death in a magnificent
old dungeon like this !" was his ever-recurring exclama-
tion. “ This tapestry would give me the blue devils.
People must have had ancestors in Harry the Eighth's
time to put up with it. Why, the Manor is thrice as
airy, and fifty times more convenient;-to say nothing
that Goody Johnston would have died here of the ague!
Hamlyn knew just what would suit me.
As a country
gentleman, I am far better off at the Manor.
The jerk with which old Mrs. Harkness snapped the
key in the door of the state-apartments, after locking
out the utterer of these insolent heresies, probably con-
veyed but half her contempt towards the presumptuous
offender. Regarding herself as part and parcel of the illus-
trious family of the Vernons, Dean Park was her wash-
pot, and over Burlington Manor did she cast her shoe.

"It is enough to keep my Lord away from the place,"
muttered the stern housekeeper, as she dropped the
Colonel's sovereign scornfully into her purse, "to be
troubled with the intrusion of the upstart tribe of
Hamlyn, the banker!"
Dr. Markham's description to his wife of the scarcely-
suppressed choler of the irate old lady served, that even-
ing, to enliven the homely tea-table of the Vicarage.
« Colonel Hamilton was pleased, then, with his drive ?”
demanded Mrs. Markham of her husband.
“ Pleased as a child. It does one's heart good to see a
grey-headed man so fresh in spirit. He enjoyed all he
saw and heard, like a schoolboy at home for the holidays.”
“And what is he else ?” 'inquired Mrs. Markham.
“He tells me he went out to India at fifteen,
boy from the Charter House, -half-educated, and wholly
ignorant of English habits and pleasures.
“So much the better for him! To the young men
of the present day, on emerging from Haileybury, India
is banishment; and banishment which their expensive
habits tend to prolong. Hamilton was both frugal and
contented; and now he is come home, full of eagerness
for the common pleasures with which other men are
surfeited.”
“ His chief pleasure, worthy man, seems to be doing
good,” observed Mrs. Markham, who was bound Colonel
Hamilton's slave for ever, by the number of yards of
flannel and pairs of blankets with which he had already
enriched her treasury for the Ovington poor.

dear! It is not for us to enlarge upon

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“Why, certainly, the good Colonel's respect for our
Ovington school-houses and infirmaries was a little dimi-
nished on observing the priority of such institutions as
Vernon College. But to what does this amount ? That
the Vernons have been doing for four centuries what the
Hamlyns began only forty years ago, but will, I trusta
persist in for four centuries to come!' Napoleon's Mar-
shal, old Lefévre, once said to a noblèman of the ancien
régime; · You are mighty proud of your ancestors. Well,
I am an ancestor ! Some day or other Hamlyn's de-
scendants will be in the Upper House.".
“But Dean Park will never be the Hyde of 2235!"
observed the Vicar's wife, shaking her head.
“ I'm afraid not,” rejoined her husband, laughing at
her solemnity of tonė. -" Whatever else we do for pos-
terity, we don't build for them. However, I should have
been vexed had poor Hámlyn witnessed this morning the
surprise of his Indian friend, on discovering that the acts
of beneficence he had believed to originate solely in the
wisdom and virtue of Dean Park, an especial invention of
Richard Hamlyn, Esq., M.P., are but a modernized edi-
tion of the old charities of the Vernons."
Little did Dr. Markham surmise, debarred as a Pro-
testant minister from the advantages of confession over
the parishioners to whom he was appointed to preach the
gospel on Sundays, the extent to which this rivalship
and jealousy had influenced through life the conduct and
character of Mr. Hamlyn. His disposition and destinies
had been literally created by the vicinity of Dean Park
to the Hyde.
The only son of a mercantile man, unexpectedly en-
riched by one of those startling speculations which, during
the early half of the last century, begat and extinguished
millions, the elder Hamlyn had purchased the estate
of the Dean, enclosed the' Park, and concentrated the
property ; leaving to his son, the father of the present
proprietor, the care of erecting a family mansion, propor-
tionate to the estate.
People never do build houses in proportion to their
estates. Their pride will not let them, and their archi-
tects will not let them. To build a house is, as it were,

41
to favour the public with the measure of your fortune
and either policy as a banker, or weakness as a man, in-
clined old Hamlyn to create an exaggerated idea of his
property, by providing himself with a residence requiring
a nobleman's income and establishment for its support.
The Lord Vernon of that generation was unluckily a
simple, sociable man, estimating his position as much too
low, as the present representative of the family rated it
too high. United to Hamlyn of Dean by the bond of
country neighbourship, viz., to preserve foxes, prosecute
trespassers, and blunderbuss poachers for the benefit of
the community, the moment the banker began to build,
the peer began to beset him with evil counsel.
“There is nothing more mistaken than to stint your-
self in the proportions of your rooms, the numbering
your bed-rooms, or the accommodation of your offices, for
the value of a trifle of brick and mortar!" said he. “ A
couple of thousand pounds, more or less, covers all the
difference between an indifferent house and a good one."
Acting on this principle, old Hamlyn preferred build-
ing one that was excellent, and completing his establish-
ment on the model of that of Lord Vernon; and the con-
sequence was that, when the new family mansion of the
Hamlyns came to be discussed at justice meetings, turn-
pike meetings, and quarter sessions, the smaller squires
of the neighbourhood ventured to predict that, on the
death of the old banker, and division of his property,
Dean Park would prove too much for his son. Old
Gratwycke, of Gratwycke House, quoted from Bacon
that a house with wings oftentimes flies away with an
estate; while Mr. Barlow, of Alderham, jocosely chris-
tened the banker's folly, “the Lombard Street Ormeau.'
These remarks did not happen to reach the ear of
Richard Hamlyn till he had negatived one auspicious
occasion of improving his fortunes, by uniting himself
with a woman who, having only ten thousand pounds,
passed in the moneyed circles to which he belonged for
being penniless. The insulting surmises of his country
neighbours stung him to the soul; yet, on his father's
death, which occurred within a year of his marriage, so
far from abandoning Dean Park, or allowing the ad.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
mirable charitable foundations created by his parents to
decay, Richard Hamlyn, as has been already advanced,
increased rather than diminished the liberality of his
housekeeping; and by the admirable discipline kept up
in his establishment-kitchen, stables, farm,-nay, even
in the family circle—was enabled to maintain his position
in the county, head and front with the Vernons of the
Hyde, and the Burlingtons of Burlington Manor. No-
body had any further right to say that the old banker
had over-built himself. The only change for the worse
perceptible in the household, was in the spirits of its
master.
Meanwhile, as much as the present proprietor of Dean
Park seemed resolved to walk in the steps of his prede-
cessor, did the Lord Vernon, who in process of time, and
a slow
process
it was, succeeded to the jovial old sports-
man, appear determined to institute a new order of things
at the Hyde. As if he had taken a spite at the old man-
sion where his father had survived immoderately, he spent
all his interludes of London dissipation at his Castle in
the North ; and when he did visit Warwickshire, (which,
in the old lord's time, he had represented in Parliament,)
his attentions to his neighbours were paid with such
punctilious regard to their graduated claims upon his
notice, that one or two of the more plain-spoken country
squires had seen fit to reject as an insult the notice
measured out to them in proportion to the exact square
of their acres. Old Gratwycke, of Gratwycke House,
for instance, whose property consisted of a farm on which
his family had been settled from the days of the Dun
Cow, did not feel, in the opportunity of deciding once
a-year upon the merit of Lord Vernon's French cook,
Italian confectioner, and German maitre-d'hôtel, sufficient
repayment for the impertinence of his lordship’s wife and
daughter. Unable to maintain the same terms with the
son on which he had lived with the father, he chose to
forget the existence of the Hyde.
Such was not the case with Richard Hamlyn. He
could not at once renounce the ambition in which he had
been born and nurtured, of living on a friendly footing
with the Vernons. He fancied that the intimacy had

given him importance with his wife's family-with his city
connexions—with the county-with the world; andwhen
ever Lord and Lady Vernon were in Warwickshire,smarted
severely under the undisguised neglects of the Hyde.
But while the London banker continued to hunger and
thirst after the notice of the great people who had with-
drawn the light of their countenance, the rest of the
country neighbours were satisfied to enlist their sym-
pathies in the long illness and early death of Sir Roger
Burlington, and the arrival of a successor at the Manor.
A thousand wild surmises went forth touching the new
lessee—the strange Nabob—the rich widower—who, if
too old to marry again, was at least of an age to die and
be succeeded in his fortune. Colonel Hamilton was a
perfect treasure to the gossips of Braxham and Ovington!
His couple of native servants—his hookah-his Thibet
goats—his Indian curiosities of all kinds—were as great
a resource to the parish as the arrival of a show of wild
beasts;
and when it became known that he talked of a
ball at Christmas for Miss Hamlyn's début, everybody
was quite satisfied that Sir Roger Burlington had done
wisely to vacate his family seat; and that they were under
considerable obligations to the widow for having settled
in Italy.
In process of time, the feuds between the Colonel's
factotum, Johnston, and Sir Roger's head gardener, An-
derson, whom, at Hamlyn's suggestion, he had hired with
the place, occupied nearly as much attention in the vici-
nity of Ovington as a county election. The Colonel had
chosen to give his duplicate key of the gardens and
pineries to Goody Johnston, and the head gardener to
give warning. Opinions were divided. Some thought
that a gardener who used to ensure the late Sir Roger
his green peas at Christmas, his strawberries on Valen-
tine's day, and his peaches on April fool's day, was quite
right not to be “put upon;" but to go and seek his two
hundred guineas per annum elsewhere. But the ma-
jority were decided Johnstonians, and voted that Colonel
Hamilton, like the Chamberlain-making kings of Germany,
had a right to bestow his keys where he thought proper.
Even Mrs. Hamlyn ventured to give an opinion, when

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
she understood that the indignant Anderson had offered
his services at the Hyde.
“I am afraid you will miss him sadly in the flower-
garden,” said she. “ From long practice, Anderson un-
derstands the Burlington forcing-houses better than any
stranger can do."
My dear good lady," cried the Colonel, in reply, “ I
would rather all the shrubberies were rooted up, and that
never another pine-apple should be eaten in my house,
than put up with a fellow who has offered offence to
Goody Johnston! What harm would she have done in
the gardens, more than my wife or daughter-if I had
'em? Let the fellow go to the Hyde—and let the Hyde
go to the devil-- rather than that any slight should be
shown, under my roof, to the faithful attendant of the
most faithful wife that ever bequeathed her memory to
the respect of a husband.”
On this occasion, even the banker exercised his influ.
ence in vain. Mr. Hamlyn discovered that though, in
matters of business, a puppet in his hands, the old Co-
lonel, where his feelings were concerned, would display
the most mulish obstinacy.
Satisfied from her letters that his wife was too high-,
minded or too indolent to counteract by her personal in-
fluence that of the favourite servants of whose ascendancy
over Colonel Hamilton he entertained the most mistrust-
ful jealousy, the banker accused himself of improvidence
in having placed the Nabob beyond the reach of his own
daily obsequiousness and serviceability. The following
week, therefore, he arrived on a visit of investigation at
Dean Park.
“Excuse me, my dear Hamlyn,” cried his candid old
friend, on seeing him, “if I own that your sallow face
and care-worn wrinkles put me wonderfully in conceit
with my country life. Why, you're young enough to be
my son; and, by George ! you look old enough to be
“ The late hours and trying atmosphere of the House
of Commons make sad inroads into the constitution!"
replied Hamlyn, with the air of the martyr.
Come, come, come! none of your flourishes, in
my father!”

honour of your services to the country. A banker was
never known to die of patriotism,” cried the Colonel."
"Those jaundiced looks have very little to do with zeal
for the nation. 'Tis all shop, my dear, sir, -all gold-
spinning,-all the wear and tear of filthy lucre,—all the
care and anxiety of money-making, - all the yellow
leprosy, as I call it.”
Say, rather, of taking care of other people's money,"
replied Hamlyn, attempting a smile.
“ So long as you take such capital care of mine, I
suppose I must find no fault,” replied the Lord of Bur-
lington Manor, jocosely. “But I feel that I'm beginning
to have over you all the advantage of a country gentle-
man. Not but that the country-gentleman's estate bears
its brambles as well as its blackberries. I suppose Mrs,
Hamlyn, or dear Lydia, wrote you word that the people
hereabouts have been playing the very deuce with me ?"
This familiar and affectionate designation of his
daughter grated disagreeably on the ear of the banker;
and accepting the word “people” in its lowest sense,
“Mrs. Hamlyn informed me,” said he,“ that the fish-
ponds at Burlington Manor had been robbed.”
“Ay, so the keepers swore, who most likely dragged
them themselves. But I alluded to Markham and
Gratwycke, who have dragged me into the commission of
the peace. The Doctor chose to assert, sir, that I had
hired the trouble and worry of being a magistrate, in
hiring Burlington Manor ?”
"Very officious of Markham !” observed the banker,
who disliked every measure tending to increase Colonel
Hamilton's connexion with society; and chose, at all
events, that the proposition should proceed from himself.
It seemed to him, indeed, as if Gratwycke and the Vicar,
in meddling with Colonel Hamilton, had encroached
upon his property.
“Had I been aware of this in time, I should have pro-
tested against your incurring so much trouble and re-
sponsibility,” said he. “At your age, my dear sir, I
really think
Come, come, come! I've no great right to take
shelter under my age,” cried the Colonel. 6 These

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
gentlemen see that I am young enough to amuse myself
by scampering over the country on a pony after my little
Lydia, and are kind enough to procure me a more useful
employment for my time."
" It is true there is a sad dearth of efficient men among
us,” replied Hamlyn, perceiving that the Colonel chose
to be put upon.
“ The neighbourhood is thin. The
Hyde lends us no assistance. Gratwycke is nearly super-
annuated."
And not an idle man under five-and-sixty for twenty
miles round !" cried Colonel Hamilton.
“Poor Lydia,
sad news for poor dear little Lydia! I don't know what
you'll do for your Christmas ball, my dear, unless you
can persuade your brother Walter to bring you down
some beaux from Lon'on.”
Richard Hamlyn, though his previous instructions
had authorized, on the part of his family, every sacrifice
likely to make the country pleasant to his valued consti-
tuent, was annoyed at the tone of familiarity which seemed
to have established itself between Colonel Hamilton and
his daughters. Before he returned to town, he remon--
strated severely with his wife concerning the relaxation
of decorum arising from the absence of Miss Creswell.
“What will the Vernons think,” said he, “ when they
hear of the Miss Hamlyns, (after the care bestowed on
their education,) scampering-I use Colonel Hamilton's
word—scampering' over the country on ponies ? And
what chance has Walter of recommending himself to the
Colonel's good-will, if Lydia is constantly made his first
object ?”
Mrs. Hamlyn was too respectful a wife to vindicate
either her girls or herself. But after her husband's return
to town, she was amused to perceive how much the aid of
the country had opened the eyes of the old Colonel to the
peculiarities of his friend.
“Hamlyn's quite right to stick to Lon'on!” said he.
“Hamlyn's cut out for a man of business. Squirefying
is not his element. He hasn't in him the true smack of
the country-gentleman. 'Tis all dot-and-carry-one with
him, even in the middle of a turnip-field. His tenants
respect him, but more by name than nature; and, not-.

withstanding all he has done for the poor, and the admi-
rable management by which it has been brought about,
they seem to feel themselves doubly poor in his presence.
He's too prim and trim for a sportsman, too in-doorish
for a farmer. Lombard Street and Cavendish Square,
parliament and city meetings, are the place for Hamlyn.
There are some folks who don't seem to have been born
for the open air !"
“ At forty-five,
is difficult to
guess
what
born for,” said Mrs. Hamlyn, with a sigh.
“ Grave as
my husband now appears, I can assure you that when
I married, he was one of the gayest men about town, -as
his son Walter is now.
“Walter's wild, is he? I'm glad of that! There's
always hope of a wild young man ! My son Jack was one
of the wildest dogs ever turned out of Eton. Walter
was quartered at Windsor all the time I was in Lon'on,
and I'm beginning to want to make his acquaintance.
Does he never come down to Dean Park ?”
“ When the hunting season begins.”
“A curious reason for visiting his father's house !
Like
my friend Sir Joshua Alltrump, who told me he
attended Divine service at the Chapel Royal 'cause the
music was so fine.”
“My son is, I admit, passionately fond of hunting,"
pleaded Mrs. Hamlyn.
“ Well, well, 'tis something, in these times, for a
youngster to be passionately fond of anything! To me all
the boys appear as dull and care-worn as if they'd spent
a life in Lombard Street; old before they're breeched,
and decrepit in their accidence. I should never be sur-
prised, now-a-days, to hear of an Eton boy having the
gout. Well! I must wait patient, I suppose, till the
hounds are unkennelled, to shake hands with Master
Watty.”
Mrs. Hamlyn could scarcely forbear smiling at the
idea of the indignation with which (had Sheet Street
Barracks been within earshot of Dean Park) her super--
fine son would have heard himself thus familiarly desig-
nated, by an individual who might have travelled from
(Captain Hamlyn's) Dan to Beersheeba, i. e. from St.

James's Street to Whitehall, without receiving a bow of
recognition from the club windows; and whose clothes
were so indefinitely cut by his nameless tailor, as to have
made them an equally good fit for any other man in the
county.
She amended her smile, however, into a secret prayer
that the time might come when Walter, now the slave of
appearances, would recognise the sterling merit of such
a man as the simple-hearted being before her.
CHAPTER IV.,
“ Before my gaze I see my youth,
The ghost of gentler years, arise;
With looks that yearn'd for every truth,
And wings that sought the furthest skies.
Beside that ghost of time gone by
I stand upon the waste alone,
And if a sunbeam light the sky,
It wakes no flowerets from the stone. .
The icy calm that smiles on all
But comes from pride that veils the pain;
Alas! how much we fain would call
Content,-is nothing but disdain.”
SIR-BULWER LYTTON.
THE merits of the new resident at Burlington Manor
were becoming appreciated in quarters more important
than the fastidious fancy of a Captain of the Household
Brigade. The county gentry already congratulated them-
selves on the acquisition of such a coadjutor in their
labours of public peace-keeping, as a man accustomed
for forty years to administrative functions, yet untried
by the disappointments which are somewhat apt to sour
the philanthropy, and distress the patriotism of the con-
script fathers of a shire. At turnpike meetings, justice
meetings, agricultural meetings, the hearty, active, old
man was invariably first and last in the field.
But, above all, he was recognised by the minor guar-
dians of the public weal as the proprietor of a capacious
heart and purse, the strings of which were always open.
The circumstance which had first drawn his attention in

India to the firm of Hamlyn and Co. was the magnitude
and consistency of their subscriptions to all public chari-
ties and institutions; little surmising, good easy man!
that these donations were so many advertisements of
their solidity, by speciously introducing a commercial
name into the columns of the newspapers, to be wafted to
the four quarters of the globe on the wings of their well-
calculated beneficence. But for this blessed iteration, in
fact, their name might never have reached Ghazerapore.
As innocently as he had fallen into the snare did he
now conquer, by similar means, the esteem of a county
predisposed against him as an invader of the property of
the ancient house of Burlington.
“Who is this man, the new tenant of poor Burlington's
place ?” had been eagerly inquired, when first the news
transpired of the desecration of the Manor.
“Some man who made his money in India, -picked up
by Hamlyn, the banker, in the course of his city con-
nexion," --was the disparaging reply. And the country-
gentlemen, averse to new-comers in general, and doubly
averse to the idea of a rich upstart-who would crush
them by his ostentation, outshine them by his equipage,
and corrupt their homely households by the prodigalities
of his servants' hall-entered into tacit combination
against the banker's protégé.
But no sooner did they find in the neighbour whom
they had pictured to themselves as a peevish, enervate
hypochondriac, the victim of liver and blue pill, a hale,
happy-spirited, old gentleman, full of child-like interest
in the memorabilia of the county, as well as of manly
sympathy in its wants and welfare, than they extended
towards him the right hand of fellowship; wondering
only how any bond of friendship .could subsist between
the frank, garrulous, old Indian, and the calm, phleg-
matic, hard-headed owner of Dean Park.
For in the county, Hamlyn was more approved than
liked. His gentlemanly deportment and handsome, orderly
establishment commanded respect; but the neighbour-
ing squires were never sorry, during his absence, to have
a fling at his political surfaceism, or the cockney niceties
of his model-farm.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Among the foremost ranks of these stood a gentleman
of the name of Barlow, who took considerable pains to
impress himself on public attention as “Barlow of Alder-
ham,” lest, being chiefly known in the county as Lord
Vernon's agent, it should be overlooked that he was an
entity by inheritance, an esquire by qualification. That
the Alderham in question was “a moated Grange,"
standing on a farm of four hundred a-year, signified
nothing. The great grandsires of his great grandsire had
been born under its roof; and he was consequently en-
titled to talk loud at the convivial and other meetings
of the neighbourhood, about "county families," "here-
ditary rights," and the “ landed interests” of the shire.
Mr. Barlow of Alderham seldom lowered his voice, indeed,
unless when Lord Vernon, his principal, happened to be
residing at the Hyde; but he was observed never to raise
it so defyingly as in the presence of Richard Hamlyn, of
Dean Park.
For in their various election contests, Barlow of Alder-
ham appeared in the field as generalissimo of the Vernon
faction; and being invariably defeated, it was but natural
he should aim his avenging darts, on other occasions, at
the vulnerable heel of the banker. In many points he
enjoyed advantages over him. He was always on the
spot-constantly holding forth wherever two or three
landed-interest” apostles were gathered together-in
daily scud across the country on his well-known brown
cob, on Lord Vernon's business or his own; and, above
all, as vicegerent of the estate of the Hyde, he dispensed
the squirearchical patronage of its shooting, its fishing,
and the private keys of the park. Those who wished to
stand well with the Vernons fancied they could not begin
better than by standing well with Barlow of Alderham.
All this had been fully interpreted by Hamlyn to
Colonel Hamilton, on his first arrival in Warwickshire ;
and, as the old gentleman had no disposition for toadying,
and was disgusted at his very first interview by the bow-
wow tone of the agent, and his perpetual allusions to
“county families” and “hereditary rights,” he received,
with as much coldness as was compatible with his humane
nature, the civil overtures of a man unfairly represented

51
to him by the banker as the servile slave-driver of a lord.
He could not dissever Barlow (of Alderham) in his mind,
from the salaried tenant-screw of Lord Vernon.
Surprised at the disregard with which his civilities
were treated by one whom Dr. Markham and old Grat-
wycke described as the most courteous and kindly of
human-beings, Mr. Barlow, debarred by a sense of duty
towards the political interests of his patron from being
resentful, was careful to issue instructions to the keepers
at the Hyde, that the land and water privileges enjoyed
by the late Sir Roger Burlington should be conceded to
his successor. A key of the private gates of the park
was accordingly forwarded to the Manor, specifically in-
scribed with the name of Colonel Hamilton, who, ignorant
of county customs, and conceiving the right of transit
over Lord Vernon's property to be one of the many
im-
munities included in his leasehold of Burlington Manor,
acknowledged the courtesy by a handsome gratuity to the
head-keeper, but not a word of acknowledgment to the
higher powers.
Mrs. Hamlyn, who, in common with the other neighbour-
ing families, possessed a key, but was scrupulous in using
it, in deference to the uneasy position of her husband with
regard to Lord Vernon at every fresh election, was startled
to perceive how thoroughly the unsuspecting Colonel
made himself at home at the Hyde.
“ In dusty weather, that beautiful Pinetum is a mon-
strous resource to the neighbourhood," cried he. “I
delight in the smell of the thyme, crushed under the
wheels of my phaeton; yet, except myself, (the head-
keeper says, a smart, intelligent, civil fellow !) not a soul
ever sets foot in it."
Sophia hesitated for a moment whether to hint to the
old man, so ready to contribute to the pleasures of others,
that even he might do well to abstain ;—that Lord Vernon
was supposed to be tenacious of the privacy of his reserved
walks, more especially as regarded persons connected
with Dean Park. But Colonel Hamilton was not the
man to be enlightened by a hint. His self-love was not
of a susceptible or mistrustful kind. Aware that Dr.
Markham profited by a short cut across the Hyde every

time he had business at Braxbam, he would have laughed
at the idea of offending the hauteur of the Vernons by
frank acceptance of a favour spontaneously conceded.
Before Barlow of Alderham had thoroughly recovered
his surprise at the coolness of an individual who, so far
from belonging to a county family," was unconnected
with any family at all, the Colonel was giving offence by
new insults to his flag.
During the long illness of Sir Roger Burlington, the
sporting over his estates had been placed without reser-
vation at the disposal of his friend and neighbour at Dean
Park; the terms of election enmity between whom and
Barlow forbad any civilities towards the latter on the
shooting score. But now, on the opening of the shoot-
ing-season, though the Colonel was said to have extended
his permission to shoot over the Manor to a degree
horrific to the feelings of every high-principled game-
preserver in the county, no opening had been made for
the agent of the adjoining estate of the Hyde-an un-
neighbourly and monstrous exclusion.
While Barlow of Alderham was huffing over his sense
of injury, tidings of Colonel Hamilton's laxity as a game-
preserver proved still more appalling to Richard Hamlyn.
So thoroughly did he reckon upon retaining his privi.
leges over the Manor with a tenant who avowed his ab-
horrence of Nock or Manton, double-barrels or single,
that he had not made the concession a clause of especial
reserve in a lease dictated by himself. As a matter of
course, he regarded the preserves of the isolated friend-
less old man of Portland Place as his perquisite. And to
find them thus desecrated-to learn that, for the future,
he had only his own miserable shooting to offer to the
aristocratic guests, whom it was his glory, every winter,
to advertise in the
papers as “spending the Christmas
holidays at the hospitable seat of Mr. Hamlyn, at Dean
Park,” was a stroke for which he was unprepared.
All he had hitherto been able to oppose to the galling
slights of Lord Vernon, in a worldly sense, was the
choiceness of an aristocratic circle under his roof, fully
rivalling that of the Hyde. As an active member of the
Tory party in the House of Commons, Hamlyn possessed

53
a certain degree of influence; while, as a banker, he had
found means of obliging various of the nobility, who
obliged him by their notice in return; dined with him in
town, and shot with him in the country. The Ormeau ;
hounds, and the Burlington preserves, had placed Dean
Park among the most desirable places on which lordly
placemen or dukes, debarred by distance from sporting
at their Scotch or Irish seats, could quarter themselves
for the holidays. And now what was to be done? How
was he to invite his customary guests, or Walter to bring
down to Dean his showy brother officers, without the pro-
mise of a battue ? Colonel Hamilton had done himi' irre-
parable injury by his inconsiderate liberality to strangers!
In his private room in Lombard Street, while' appa-
rently engaged in calculations involving the fate of mil-
lions, and the welfare of his clients, the banker pondered
heavily upon these things. In that gloomy, silent retreat,
the den of his leisure, divided by a wainscot only from
the vast counting-house wherein twenty assiduous clerks
were engaged in the active transaction of business, greas-
ing the wheels of public traffic, and amassing grain by
golden grain, the sand destined to fill the auspicious hour-
glass of the Hamlyn dynasty-in that silent retreat of
which, once at least in every day, some trembling peti-
tioner crossed the threshold, referred by the chief clerk
to the head of the house for the fiat which was to pro-
nounce his bill dishonoured, or inscribe his cheque with
“no effects,” did Richard Hamlyn, blind to the rise or
fall of stocks, indifferent to the fate of exchequer bills,
and careless of the fluctuations of the money market, sit
cursing his own oversight in having failed to secure to
himself the sporting over Burlington Manor.
Though the atmosphere discernible through the sky-
light of that little chamber was obscured by city smoke,
divided from the pure ether of heaven as by the inter-
posing of a blanket, the baffled proprietor of Dean Park
beheld, in his mind's eye, the clear blue sky of his country
seat; and heard, in his mind's ear, the popping of hun-
dreds of percussion guns, shooting away his prospects
in life.
Never could this reverse of fortune, as a landed pro-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
prietor, have come more inopportunely! His jealous
hatred of the Vernons, so far from mellowing and drop-
ping from the tree, had of late acquired new aggravation.
Though he had defeated the predictions of the Hyde that
he would be forced to sell an estate where his father had
over-built himself, Hamlyn's indignation against the
family had been renewed by learning that, at a political
London dinner, on being questioned concerning the
honourable member for Barthorpe, (his opponent,) Lord
Vernon had spoken of himself in terms the most indul-
gently insulting
“Of Mr. Hamlyn, personally, I really know nothing."
was his lordship’s insolent reply. “We exchange cards,
bows, dinners, and I believe him to be a well-intentioned
person;
but my agent (Barlow of Alderham) assures me
that Mr. Hamlyn's petty, money-spinning system, has
done infinite harm in my neighbourhood. Since the in-
troduction of Savings Banks, Loan Societies, and pre-
mium companies of all sorts and kinds at Ovington, all
the small farmers in the county fancy themselves on the
road to become Rothschilds. It is amazing how mer-
cenary and grasping the very labourers are becoming,
since this notion of per centage gained ground. All their
idea is money--money-money! Natural enough, per-
haps, on the part of Mr. Hamlyn, to follow the bias of
his calling, even in his charities. For I verily believe
that, were you to drop a London banker out of a caravan
in the desert, his first notion would be to establish a
Water-company at the nearest well! Mr. Hamlyn will,
however, perhaps be the first to repent having introduced
the mystery of money-making into our bewildered county."
If Hamlyn, by sacrifices the extent of which was known
only to himself, had discountenanced Lord Vernon's for-
mer prediction that his father's memory would be dis-
graced and his estate brought to the hammer, he was
now scarcely less intent upon proving that his children
were likely to maintain their footing, if not exactly on the
same level, exactly in the same circles as Lord Vernon's
He had authorized his son Walter to invite, for a
week's shooting at Christmas, the Cornet of his troop,

whose family he numbered among his constituents, and
contemplated adding to the Dean Park party purporting
to rival the festivities of the Hyde. But how was he to
phrase his invitations to the Earl of Rotherwood, and his
brother-in-law Lord Crawley, uncles of the Marquis, un-
less enabled to make honourable mention of the preserves
of Burlington Manor ?
Little did
poor
Colonel Hamilton surmise the evils to
which he had given rise by an extension of sporting libe-
rality, which, as far as numbers were concerned, had
created a popularity that might have enabled him to stand
for the county. While Dean Park and the Hyde (in the
person of Barlow of Alderham) complained bitterly of a
weakness, exposing more, rigid landed proprietors to
blame, and involving the keepers of the neighbouring
estates in endless affrays and squabbles, he delighted to
see the neighbouring squires, and even farmers, enjoy a
day's shooting on the Manor. Though thoroughly de-
spising, as became a practised hog-hunter, the puny field
sports of Great Britain, he was not sorry to find that the
note of preparation from the Ormeau kennel was about
to re-assemble the scattered families of the neighbour-
hood. The turf being now brown, and the woods bare, it
was, indeed, time that people should return from touring
and the sea-side, to enjoy the beauties of the country,
“More wood, Johnston !-more wood !" cried the hos-
pitable old man, one evening when the ladies of Dean
Park and their friends from the Vicarage had been driven
behind screens and into recesses, by the blaze of a roaring
fire of roots at Burlington Manor. “Merry Christmas
is coming—and let us welcome him with a bonfire! Well
do I remember the bitter mornings when I used to get
up by candle-light at the Charter House, blowing my
fingers all the time to save 'em from being frost-bitten!
But if we don't make a good jolly season of it now, 'tis
nobody's fault but our own!"
“You have taken care at least, sir, that the poor
shall
have no reason to complain," observed Mrs. Markham,
gratefully.
I seldom find that they do complain half so much as
the rich. But this year, even the rich must not grumble!

Lydia, for instance, shall have her ball, and her sledge,

“I fear Miss Creswell will interfere with some
portion of these arrangements," interposed Mrs. Hamlyn,
satisfied that they would incur the entire disapproval of
her husband.
Why, what the deuce! The governess coming back
again, is she ?” said Colonel Hamilton. “I was in hopes
she was pensioned off! I'm sure there's nothing Miss
Harriet wants teaching, but she might learn from her
sister.”
“We are expecting a large Christmas party at Dean
next week,” she replied, not choosing to cite Mr.
Hamlyn's opposition;" and I should scarcely know what
to do with the girls."
“Do with 'em ? why, let 'em help you to entertain
the large party, to be sure !” cried the Colonel.
“ I dare
say Lydia would have no objection !"
“Her father would. Lord and Lady Rotherwood and
their brother-in-law, Lord Crawley, are coming to us."

I want to badger him about having remitted the sentence
of that rascal Saltash. But what exception are they
likely to take to the society of an agreeable girl like
Lydia ?”

lords think proper to come and sleep under your roof,

"I am happy to say that Walter will be with us,"
replied Mrs. Hamlyn, unwilling to own her perfect coin-
cidence in his sentiments. “He is coming on the 20th,
accompanied by one of his brother officers; and I trust,
deår sir, that while our house is enlivened by these

guests, you will join our party. The weather is too un-
certain for you to return to Burlington at night.”
Faith, I should have no objection !" cried the
Colonel ; "but, unluckily, I've asked Gratwycke's grand-
son to come over to me for a few days' shooting; and I
suppose you've no room to take him in? Though Walter
might like his company, maybe ; for I fancy he's to be a
brother soldier of the Captain's!"
« The idea of that silly, lanky Tom Gratwycke being a
brother-any-thing of Walter's !” exclaimed Lydia, unable
to restrain her mirth. Dear, dear Colonel Hamilton !
you little know my brother,—the pink of fine gentle-
men!"
Is he ? He was a deuced bad shoeblack at Eton, I
know! Jack, whose fag he was, wrote me word he could
make nothing of him. As to Tom Gratwycke, I am
afraid the lad is a bit of a spoony. But the old gentle-
man's been wonderful civil in asking me a dozen times to
dimer, (though I'd as soon dine in the Ovington infirmary
as in his hot rooms ;) and the least I could do was to
show kindness to his grandson in return. The lad we
think nothing of, is a world's wonder to him, -the future
Gratwycke of Gratwycke,—his Watty,-his pink of fine
gentlemen!"
On the banker's arrival at Dean, a day or two previous
to that of his visitors for the holidays, it was a source of
considerable mortification to him that Colonel Hamilton
was not of the party. He had reckoned upon his friend's
company as prematurely as upon his shooting; and was
greatly disappointed to find that the old gentleman was
not fated to make acquaintance with his son under all the
advantage (to a young man of Walter's brilliant appear-
ance and address) of doing the honours of his father's
house to a party of distinction.
Mrs. Hamlyn perceived that her husband was sove-
reignly displeased; that he thought she might have
secured the company of their neighbour by an earlier in-
vitation. Hamlyn was unusually absent and out of sorts

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Warwickshire, so far from being laid aside, as he had
intended on joining his family, was buckled on anew on
learning that an insignificant boy like Tom Gratwycke
could become an obstacle to his deep-laid projects.
“The Vernons are coming down next week!” said he,
fixing a stern eye upon his wife. Then finding that she
did not utter so much as an ejaculation of surprise at an
announcement wholly indifferent to her, he added, " and
what will they think on finding that a man of Hamilton's
property could command no better resource for his
Christmas circle than a vulgar hobble-de-hoy like
young Gratwycke ?”
“I should think they would trouble themselves very
little about the family arrangements of a perfect
stranger!" replied Sophia, finding he insisted upon an
answer.
“But we are not perfect strangers to them. We
should have derived some consequence
in their
eyes from
the domestication at our fire-side of a man of Hamilton's
enormous property, who is supposed to care for nobody
but ourselves. I had flattered myself our Christmas
party would be a matter of some envy at the Hyde.”
“I have little doubt," observed Mrs. Hamlyn, struck
by what she considered a brilliant inspiration, “that if
you really have Colonel Hamilton's company at heart, it
might be obtained by Lydia's intervention. If you will
compromise with his whims, by allowing her to join
the party, as when we are alone, he might surely be per-
suaded to defer young Gratwycke's visit till the following
week ?"
Mr. Hamlyn, who had been traversing the room in a
fit of mental irritation, now advanced close to his wife, as
if to ensure the exact hearing of her words.
Lydia ?” cried he ; “ Lydia possess sufficient influence
over Hamilton to induce him to grant a request he has
denied to us ?”
"You are aware of his fondness for
young people,"
replied Mrs. Hamlyn, composedly; "and" his indulgence
towards the girls, having insured their affection in return,
they have spent much of their time together during Miss
Creswell's absence."

The respec-
“It was for this, then, that you persuaded me to allow
that woman leave of absence ?” cried the indignant
banker.
“You expressly desired we should do our utmost to
render the country agreeable to Colonel Hamilton !"
“Not to the injury of Walter! I never desired to
find Lydia his favourite. But I see how it is !
Aware
of my inability to make a provision for my daughters
tending to their settlement in life in the brilliant
position you desire, you want to bespeak the old
man's fortune for them! It would not suit you to
see Lydia become, like her mother before her, the wife
of a poor drudging man of business. No, no! you
know too much of the miseries and privations of
such , a position. You want her to be a fine lady.
You wish Colonel Hamilton's heiress to marry noble-
You have had enough of city men. What
pride have you in my family name?
tability of Hamlyn of Dean Park is nothing to you."
Mrs. Hamlyn raised her gentle eyes towards the angry
man, in utter consternation.
“But once for all, madam, know this !". continued he;
“ that sooner than Walter should not be enabled to pre-
serve his fitting station in society, and keep up his family
place in the style that his father and my father did be-
fore him,- I would--
Mr. Hamlyn paused suddenly,—and his wife, breath-
lessly interested in these singular revelations concerning
the destinies of her children, riveted her eyes on his, as if
to ascertain the motive of his hesitation. His face had
become suddenly blanched, and the words seemed frozen
on his lips; when, lo! following the direction of his eyes
towards the window, she beheld, leaning against its
single pane of plate-glass, the glowing, happy, coun-
tenance of Colonel Hamilton. The object of their
critical conversation stood intently regarding them;
having trudged in snow-shoes across the park, to welcome
his friend to the country.
“On with your great coat, and come out to me, Ham-
lyn!” shouted the old man.
“ I want to show you
some draining-tiles I've had made for me at Ovington,

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
on a plan I've often tried in Indy, with success; and the
fellow's waiting with 'em in the stable-yard."
Relieved by this cordial appeal from the apprehension
that his incautious words might have reached the ear of
Colonel Hamilton, yet so unaccustomed to be detected
in a state of mental disturbance that he fancied his
whole secret must be portrayed in his countenance,
Richard Hamlyn stood for a moment, dreading to approach
the window.
“Why, not come in, my dear Colonel ?” said he, having
ascertained by a glance that his wife had resumed her
usual air of enforced serenity.
“No, no!" was the reply.' “I have conquered my first
startle from the cold, and am in a fine glow. I'm not
going to have my nose nipped again by a second sortie,
after coddling myself in your hot rooms.
“I will be with you in a minute, then,” said Hamlyn.
“ Take a turn in the shrubbery, and I will meet you at
the offices."
But instead of obeying, Colonel Hamilton, after his
friend's exit, chose to remain at the window, talking
through it to Sophia.
“ Are you very angry, my dear lady, at my carrying off
your good man so soon ?" cried he, so loud as to be
audible, not only to herself, but to the gardeners who
were sweeping the snow from the gravel-walks.
“ Never mind, never mind! The sledge is to be
finished in a day or two, (Lydia's sledge ;-I mean to
call it the Royal Lydia,) and then she and I will drive
about the country together all the morning, and leave
you to yourselves. I like young folks best !—I'm such
a frisky old boy myself, that I always want something in
its teens about me, to keep my foolish old face in coun-
tenance!"
Accoutred for his walk, Hamlyn now made his way
along the gravel-walk towards the Colonel; who, having
at' that moment inclined his ear close to the window to
catch the faint reply of Mrs. Hamlyn, the banker had no
means of surmising the subject of their conversation.
* Ready so soon? Come along with ye, then !" cried
Hamilton, starting round on being tapped upon the

61
shoulder, and little aware of the mistrustful glances which
his friend was at that moment darting through the win-
dow, at the confused countenance of his wife. Then
seizing the arm of Hamlyn, he dragged him along, at a
brisk country gentleman's pace, somewhat at variance
with the dignified habits of the London banker.
Scarcely had they disappeared round the angle of the
house, when Mrs. Hamlyn sank heavily into a chair.
Clasping her hands together in utter despondency, she
felt scarcely equal to confront the new sources of grief
and anxiety opening in her long-embittered existence.
Had certain of her London associates been required to
point out a woman enjoying to the utmost the prosperities
and contentments of life, it would have been Mrs.
Hamlyn, of Dean Park. With a seemingly attached and
honourable busband, and promising children growing up
around her, the career of such a woman was to many' a
matter of envy. Yet, in reality, her fate was one of those
instances of personal disappointment which convert so
many cheerful girls into silent and repining women.
Within a year of her happy marriage, within a year of
the passionate protestations which, as usual, preceded it,
Sophia Hamlyn discovered that she had sunk into nothing
in the estimation of her husband. Absorbed by worldly
interests, by sordid calculations, by the anxieties of a
critical business suddenly devolving on his shoulders, he
began to regard a wife and increasing family as domestic
encumbrances, a burthen upon the onerous honours of
Hamlyn of Dean Park, an additional embarrassment to
the house of Hamlyn and Co. Still, his deference to the
decencies of society and his own high character kept him
scrupulously exact to his duties as a husband and parent;
and it was only the craving eye of affection that dis-
covered the alteration of his mood.
Luckily for all parties, Mrs. Hamlyn was a woman of
principle; and, just as deference to worldly opinion made
Richard Hamlyn a regardful husband, the sense of duty
silenced all complaints upon her lips. She felt herself
to be in the enjoyment of too many of the comforts of
life, to murmur against Providence. She had married
for better, for worse; and the worse was not so much the

62
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
worst that could have befallen her, as to justify rebellion
against her destinies.
But Sophia was only in her first lesson of the educa-
tion of the heart. By degrees, she found that, though
she might content herself with a due discharge of the
duties of her mission as a wife, a mother, a member of
the community, it was difficult, if not impossible, to re-
concile them with the exactions arising from the worldly-
mindedness of her husband. She was required to sacrifice
her influence over her children and enjoyment of their
society to his notions of the formal propriety becoming
his situation in life; to select her associates in deference
to his pecuniary interests; to regulate her loves and
likings according to the fluctuations of the money-market;
convert life into a speculation; and, even in the holy
retirement of the country, calculate her acts of bene-
volence so as at once to benefit the firm, and substantiate
her husband's position in the county of Warwick. Having
discovered all this, Sophia could no longer disguise from
herself that her early marriage had perilled her happi-
ness in this world, perhaps in the next.
To conceal the discovery from her own family and the
world was her first consideration. Never, in a single
instance, had she swerved in deference towards the hus-
band of her children. If an unhappy, she was never a
complaining wife.
Meanwhile she had her consolations. The time must
come when her children would afford the companionship
her heart so much needed. Their personal and moral
endowments were such as to gratify to the very utmost
her maternal pride; and with such prospects, she became
fortified in her forbearance.
But scarcely had the period of their maturity arrived,
when she was beset by new apprehensions. In the
handsome Walter, the idol of his father's vanity as the
future head of the firm and owner of Dean Park, she
soon discerned fatal traces of the influence of the world-
seeking education bestowed upon his boyhood. Her
affection for her warm-hearted girl, on the other hand,
was frustrated by the jealous mistrust of Mr. Hamlyn;
and she now foresaw, in the connexion of Colonel

63
Hamilton with the family, an endless source of envy and
disputation.
But it was a still deeper cause for apprehension that
at present depressed the heart of the thoughtful mother.
Aware that the man, so mild and self-controlled under
the observation of society, could, if opposed, indulge in
private in the most frantic irritation, she trembled at the
idea that the most gifted, if not most beloved, of her
children was about to incur for the first time the penalty
of filial disobedience. Her son Henry was on the eve
of drawing down upon himself the utmost violence of
parental displeasure.
While his two sons were still arrayed in jackets and
nankeen trowsers, Hamlyn, after the fashion of most
modern fathers, had decided upon their future career.
Walter was to succeed him in the borough and banking-
house, an eldest son in every sense of the word; Henry,
to go out to India, under the auspices of his maternal
uncle, an India Director. But the banker, far-sighted as
he was, was fated to defeat his own projects.
“ You will of course send your eldest son to Eton ?
Eton is the only place for making connexions. I would
not have sent Vernon to any other school than Eton, for
millions,” sounded on the part of the old Lord Vernon
too friendly an admonition to be disregarded; and from
Eton to Oxford the transition was inevitable. The
future member for Barthorpe was accordingly entered
at Christ Church ; and as his prepossessing exterior and
handsome allowance recommended him to what was called
the first society of the University, the heir of Dean Park
speedily contracted such aristocratic tastes and predilec-
tions as, on the attainment of his majority, created a
demand of some thousands upon his father, for his losses
at Hazard and on the Turf. Legal claim there was none;
but the harpies who prey upon the boyish vices of the
university represented so clamorously that the credit
of Messrs. Hamlyn, of Lombard Street, and the honour of
Squire Hamlyn of Dean Park, were inextricably involved
in the issue, that the worldly-wise banker conceived it
more prudent to be a silent victim.
On such trying occasions most fathers indulge in an

64
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
outburst of fury and insult, that suffices to provoke
further rebellion on the part of the prodigal. Richard
Hamlyn bore it like a Spartan, or rather, like a banker;
and his system of cold-blooded self-command afforded
him singular advantages over the offender. Walter was
touched by what he considered his father's generous for-
bearance; and, affected above all by his ready payment
of claims which the letter of the law enabled him to dis-
honour, resolved to accept with respect whatever penalty
might be imposed upon his fault.
Thus prepared, it was a considerable relief to his
appre-
hensions to learn that his punishment consisted in ex-
pulsion from his father's lucrative career, an object of
abhorrence to himself and contempt to his fashionable
associates.
“The irregularity of your conduct in this money trans-
action," observed Mr. Hamlyn to his son, in his usual
mild, deliberate tone, “eyinces such total deficiency of
the principles I had hoped to find in you, principles
doubly and vitally important in a man devoted to the
responsible career in which your father and grandfather
have acquired the respect of the commercial world, that
I dare not place the interests of my constituents in your
hands. Henry, therefore, will take the place reserved
for
you
in the firm. You must content yourself with
the army.”
A gleam of joy irradiated the
eyes
of the
young Oxonian.
But the visions of a guardsman's St. James's Street life,
which were the origin of his self-gratulation, faded in a
moment on learning that he was to be an ensign in a
marching regiment; and that in the event of his exceed-
ing his allowance, or compromising anew his father's
credit as a man of business, his bills on the firm would
be dishonoured without hesitation.
To this terrible denunciation, the prodigal son had the
good grace to submit without a murmur. To be gazetted
into a marching regiment was mortifying enough ;
but on the whole, it was less vilifying than the city.
The subservience in which he had been reared by his
father towards the opinions of the Hyde, had brought
forth such good fruit, that, even at Éton, Walter had

65
been put utterly out of conceit of his prospects in
life, by the name of “ Young Discount” bestowed on
him by his lordly companions; and, satisfied that his
father had too much value for his own consequence to
leave his son and heir exposed to the chance of being
sent to Sydney or Jamaica, submitted so prudently to
the sentence imposed upon him, that, twelve months
afterwards, the enfranchised ensign had progressed into
a cornet of the Household Brigade.
Henry, meanwhile, whose fortunes were thus satis-
factorily subverted, was not sorry to exchange his pros-
pects of banishment for the certainty of a provision
at home. Henry Hamlyn was a noble fellow. Less
gifted in person than his handsome brother, his mental
accomplishments were of a higher order. The darling
of Mrs. Hamlyn, the idol of his sisters, as if in vindica-
tion of the unjust favouritism which rendered the heir
of Dean an object of exclusive interest to his father,
Hepry was the only member of the family over whom
its methodical routine had exercised no unfavourable in-
fluence. Guileless and fearless as a child, enthusiastic
as a woman, in the days when there were poets on the
earth he would probably have become a poet. As it was,
Mrs. Hamlyn never allowed herself, even in the depths
of her heart, to reflect how little he was calculated to
become a banker.
On learning, at Haileybury, his sentence of reprieve
from India, Henry received with affectionate joy the
congratulations of his mother that they were not to lose
sight of each other.
“ You will see, mother,” said he exultingly, “ that, in
time, I shall make a capital banker. From the spirit
of contradiction, I suppose, I have always had a
leaning towards the vocation. Such a position as my
father's is not sufficiently appreciated. Such a position
as my father's is a most important one; requiring the
exercise of the highest faculties, and a thousand virtues,
-beginning with that of patience. Think of the number
of persons a banker has it in his power to oblige, to
assist from indigence into prosperity, to reclaim, to com-
fort! Think of the number of important schemes he is

able to forward; the number of useful inventions,
of!"
“My dear Henry,” remonstrated his mother, “you
are, as usual, too enthusiastic! Unless your views become
more practical, you will make me tremble for you and
the firm."
· Don't be afraid. For some time, at least, your flighty
boy's hands will be tied, and he will be unable to do
mischief. Besides, with such an example before me as
my father's prudence, my father's integrity, my father's
usefulness, my father's good citizenship, it will be hard,
dearest mother, if I do not progress into a model-banker,
and the best man of business in the United Kingdom.”
Such were the dispositions of Henry Hamlyn at nine-
teen. Unluckily, the harangues of the late Lord Vernon
in favour of the necessity of a college education to every
man destined to figure in parliament, had not lost their
posthumous influence over the mind of his neighbour at
Dean Park. To increase the connexions of the family,
Cambridge was preferred to Oxford for the second son;
and at Cambridge, Henry speedily afforded evidence of
such rare abilities as signalized his name in the Univer-
sity beyond all expectation.
But in proportion as his scholarship and its honours
increased, his zeal for the vocation of money-making
became less ardent. The slavery and abject occupations
of a banking-house appalled him. With a decided taste
for literature, and passionate love of travel, how was he
to reconcile the routine of a city life, or the devotion to
business which he knew would be exacted by his father ?
At every fresh avowal of these sentiments, Mrs. Hamlyn,
to whom alone his disgusts were confided, implored him
to exercise his high faculties of mind in the noblest
manner, by submitting to the career appointed for him
by Providence and his father. She entreated him at
least to forbear from any precipitate declarations; to
make the attempt;-satisfied that, once embarked in his
calling, the usual influence of Mr. Hamlyn's calm but
potent despotism would prevail; and that her son would
unconsciously sink into subordination.
Unfortunately, an excursion to Italy, between his

67
Cambridge terms, more than ever unsettled his mind;
and Henry was now on the eve of taking his degree;
resolved that if, according to general expectation, it
proved a high honour, he would seize the opportunity
to throw himself on his father's indulgence, and im-
plore redemption from a career, of all others the most
distasteful to his feelings.
Such was the dilemma which now wrung tears of
bitterness from the gentle eyes of Mrs. Hamlyn, of Dean
Park. All she had hitherto undergone was nothing to
the trials she might henceforward have to bear, in the
persons
of her children. She had not courage to con-
template the vials of wrath about to be poured upon the
head of the imprudent Henry!
Till that moment, she had never allowed herself to
appreciate all that was repellent in the character of her
husband.
CHAPTER V.!
“We understand the splendid host intends
To entertain this Christmas a select
And numerous party of his noble friends :
'Midst whom we've heard, from sources quite correct,
The Duke of D. his shooting season spends,
With many more by rank and fashion decked."
Morning Post loquitur in-Byron.
By a singular weakness in the character of the prudent
banker, though fully conscious of the superior abilities of
his second son, the member of his family of whose under-
standing he thought least highly was the one who pos-
sessed the least influence over his mind; while the son
who had seriously thwarted his projects was the one who
held real ascendancy over his heart.
Walter Hamlyn, though vain and frivolous, was one of
the most popular young men of the day. His good
manners and personal attractions rendered him a general
favourite. Manly as well as gentlemanly, his athletic
triumphs in the field and tennis-court recommended him at
Oxford and in town to the fellowship of the most fashion-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
men
able
young
of the day.
Hamlyn of the Blues" was
a known man ;--member of several of the best clubs,
and moving in the highest circles of London society.
That under such circumstances he should consider him,
self a personage of first-rate importance, was not very
wonderful. Most empty-headed fellows think the same.
The marvel was that the steady banker of Lombard
Street should share his infatuation. For Hamlyn was
proud of Walter; proud of his acceptance in society;
proud of the connexions he had formed; proud of Walter's
pride in his own position. In his person, the honours of
Dean Park were sure to experience augmentation. Lord
Vernon and his family would never presume to extend
their disparagements to a fashionable young man like
Hamlyn of the Blues.
That he had personally neglected the opportunity of
promoting himself in life by an interested marriage, had
long been a source of regret to the ambitious banker.
But he felt satisfied that his future representative would
effect something for the emblazonment of the family
escutcheon, by connecting himself, at some future time,
with the Order, the object of his jealous worship at the
Hyde.
Though Richard Hamlyn kept cautious guard over
himself against any betrayal of these weaknesses, the
unconscionable value he affixed to his fashionable son
caused him to render the epochs of Walter's visits
to Dean Park matters of the highest moment. Even
in Colonel Hamilton's presence, he was unable to dis-
guise this weakness; but the good old man, attributing
Hamlyn's constantly recurring phrase of “We will talk
of it when my son Walter arrives, “ Walter will settle
what horse would be safest for the sledge,” Better
not think of a ball till Walter has informed us how long
he can stay,” to a father's natural partiality for his first-
born, smiled aside at Lydia whenever his friend repeated
the often reiterated name of " Walter.”
“It is clear,” said Colonel Hamilton, with a knowing
glance," that my young master is top-sawyer at Dean
Park.”
On the other hand, the banker had either enlarged

considerably in his letters to Windsor on the im-
portance of conciliating their new neighbour, or the
gossip of the world had magnified fourfold the cipher of
the Colonel's fortune; for the fine gentleman of the
Blues astonished his valet and his boots considerably by
walking over with his father to the Manor, within a
couple of hours of his arrival at home; even before he
had examined the weekly card of the meets of the
Ormeau hounds.
By the result of the visit, the banker's hopes were
almost exceeded. The good will of the old soldier was
instantly conciliated by the easy good manners of the
young one: and the spell attached to the gentlemanly
demeanour of the handsome Captain Hamlyn wrought
its usual miracle in his favour. His egotism was, in fact,
so quiet, so free from fuss or ostentation, that it had the
art of passing unnoticed. In this, the age of selfishness,
there exists almost as many varieties of the vice as of dahlias
or piccotees; and ordinary minds being on their guard only
against the loud, out-spoken selfishness that appropriates
the thigh of the woodcock, the wing of the chicken, and
the best place by the fire, less glaring demonstrations of
the same sin, the silent egotisms of personal vanity, in-
tellectual pride, domestic self-seclusion, sordid calculation,
and divers others, glide through the world undetected, or
arrayed in the mask and domino of virtue.
Colonel Hamilton was not a sufficiently nice observer to
discover that Captain Hamlyn, instead of considering
himself a part of his family, considered his family a por-
tion of himself; that he looked upon the firm of Hamlyn
and Co., of Lombard Street, as the mere springs and
wheels of a time-piece, whereof a handsome Captain in
the Blues constituted the enamelled dial.
But if the designing banker triumphed in the result of
his son's visit to Burlington, Walter was thoroughly dis-
gusted. A few hurried interviews in London had not
prepared him for the reckless good-humoured familiarity
of the man thus established in the bosom of his family.
He was annoyed at the idea of exhibiting the unpolished
eccentricities of Hamilton to the quizzing of his young
friend Lord Dartford, and his noble relatives. But,

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
above all, he was deeply vexed to think of the impression
their intimacy with this strange old man might create on
the minds of the Vernons.
“We really are not sufficiently well established in the
county to commit ourselves by responsibility for the
oddities of a man so ignorant of the common forms
of the world," was his secret reflection, on quitting Bur-
lington Hatch. However, my father knows what he
is about better than most men; and since he decides
old Hamilton's company to be an inevitable evil, I
fear we must submit. À vulgar uncle or godfather, if
equally rich, were supportable; for the gift of a hundred
pound note or a charger, now and then, would plead his
apology. But a stranger, a man from whom one can
accept nothing in requital for being bored, is an over-
weight. I heartily wish this Christmas party were
over, and the Rotherwoods relieved from the corvée
of old Hamilton's vulgar jocularity.”
To live in the world without the faculty of observation,
advances a man no further in tact than to spend his days
at Ghazerapore; and poor Walter, though established in
the coteries of fashionable life, understood as little of
their impulses as the simple-hearted object of his con-
tempt. With the noble guests who, in the course of the
day, assembled at Dean Park, Colonel Hamilton had the
greatest success. So far from being shocked at his
bluntness, the Rotherwoods were inexpressibly amused
by the sallies of a person so untrammelled by the monoto-
nizing influences of fashionable life. As something ex-
ceedingly new to them, he was exceedingly welcome; and
his pungent criticisms on the follies of the day were
applauded by involuntary bursts of merriment, such as
had never before echoed under the stuccoed ceilings of
Dean Park.
Lord Crawley, on the other hand, a man who had set
up for statesmanship on a shallow stock of reading and
information, and whose knowledge consisted of facts ably
abstracted from the experience of others, contrived, in
the course of their first day's gossip, to extract a world
of information from the Colonel, touching the seat of war
in India, and the state of public opinion in the East.

While Walter Hamlyn was endeavouring to cover, by
dexterous manœuvres, the quizzicalities of the old-
fashioned Nabob's method of taking wine at dinner and
dealing at whist-peculiarities of no moment in the eyes
of people of the world-Lord Crawley and his noble
brother-in-law were chiefly anxious that the trifling young
man they tolerated as their banker's son should hold his
peace, that they might give their attention to the amusing
anecdotes of the veteran.

to have a peer or two under her roof, had been a little
apprehensive that the Oriental anecdotes, so often repeated
at Dean Park, might prove as tedious to her visitors as

wood, to whom she expressed her apprehensions. “Are
you in earnest ? Why, I never heard anything so inte-
sting in my life! What an agreeable, chatty old man,
and how much of the world he has seen!"
Mrs. Hamlyn, accustomed in her own family to hear
Colonel Hamilton's oddities attributed to having seen
nothing of “the world,” could scarcely refrain from a
smile. The good-natured Countess's interpretation of
the word, was clearly that of the Statistical Society rather
than of Almack's.
“ It is like reading an amusing book, to talk to Colonel
Hamilton," persisted Lady Rotherwood: “I literally held
my breath, last night, when he was giving us that charm-
ing account of the Lion-hunt at Chinderabad !"
Sophia, who had been listening three times a-week to
that
very
narrative for the last six months, as one of the
Colonel's crack stories ; and had been debarred by polite-
ness only from interrupting what she feared must form a
disagreeable obstacle to the political discussions of the
parliamentary men present, recognised her own miscon-
ception. It had not before struck her that the eminence
of Lady Rotherwood's position in life rendered a thousand
things new and strange to her which constituted the stale
daily bread of Cavendish Square and Deau Park.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
The excitement afforded by the hair-breadth-scape in.
ventions of a novelist, or the stirring anecdotes of a
pilgrim in the wilderness, such as Colonel Hamilton, was
an agreeable relief to the ennui of a languid Countess.
“When my nephew joins us," she observed, on the eve
of Lord Dartford's arrival, “I pray, dear Mrs. Hamlyn,
get that dear old man once more into the Ghazerapore
chapter. Dartford has not heard the stories of the Lion-
hunt, or the Nâtch-girl, or the Serpent-charmer, and
will be quite enchanted. Captain Hamlyn! pray promise
me the Lion-hunt, for your friend Dartford. My nephew
is such an enthusiastic sportsman that he will delight
in your lively, chatty, old neighbour!"
Thus encouraged, Colonel Hamilton became the star
of the party; and the enthusiasm of his auditory
seemed to develop a thousand new or forgotten sources
of information. Beset by the young Marquis with in-
quiries concerning the wild sports of the East,-by Lord
Crawley, touching its tribunals and institutions,—by the
Countess, regarding its climate, fruits, and flowers, its
suttees and incantations,—his replies were so fluent and
so varied, that Walter Hamlyn had the mortification of
finding the evening pass away without a single allusion
to London politics, or fashionable scandal, in which he
fancied himself qualified to take a distinguished part.
Further consideration satisfied him that, since it was
his object to render his father's house agreeable to the
society prized by the London banker only as conferring
importance upon Dean Park, and enabling him to make
a stand against the impertinence of the Vernons, they
inight consider themselves lucky that, while following
up their system of courtesy to the Nabob, they had un-
consciously engaged for the amusement of their friends
a first-rate conversation man!
In the sequel, the Rotherwoods were persuaded to stay
a day longer than they had promised, for the sole purpose
of a visit to the Oriental museum of their new friend at
Burlington Manor. As to the Marquis of Dartford, he
was halt afraid of allowing it to be perceived how much
he considered Dean Park, (which on a former visit he had
felt to be the acme of dulness and formality, endured only

in deference to its vicinity to the Ormeau kennel,) im-
proved by the accession of a neighbour whose warmth
and singleness of heart might have infused sociability into
a statue gallery
On the morning fixed for the Rotherwoods' departure,
Walter found the Countess so exclusively engrossed by
her pet wonder-monger, that he could find no opportunity
to pay his parting compliments.
5 What can Colonel Hamilton be bothering Lady
Rotherwood about now ?” he exclaimed, pettishly, to his
sister Lydia; who, at the instigation of her indulgent
friend, had been admitted into the party.
“Excusing himself from accompanying my father and
mother, next week, to Rotherwood Castle.''
“ You do not mean that the Rotherwoods have invited
old Hamilton ?"
• Urgently. There is to be a battue"
“But he is no sportsman; and I and Dartford have
not heard a word about it," interrupted Walter.
Perhaps Lord Rotherwood may not wish to have too
many sportsmen of the party."
“But what on earth could poor old Hamilton do in
the midst of a circle of official men, like that assembled
at Rotherwood Castle!"
“ Just what I heard him answer. He said he would
rather visit Lord and Lady Rotherwood when they were
alone; that he liked a snug party best!"
“What a man!" ejaculated Walter, shrugging his
shoulders. “What must Lady Rotherwood have thought
of him?"
“Probably that he paid her house a great compliment.
It is not often the Rotherwoods find their company pre-
ferred to their pheasant-shooting.”
“ How little are such people to be depended upon!"
was Captain Hamlyn's secret reflection. The last time
the Rotherwoods were here, my father was at the trouble
of inviting the most amusing set in London to ineet them:
Flimflam, the reviewer, and Augustus Brag, the best
chit-chatterer in town. Yet Lady Rotherwood never came
down to breakfast, and was, I suspect, bored to death.
And now, to be engouée by this dreadful old Munchausen !

THE BANKER'S WIFE;

Caprice de grande dame, I suppose! It will be most annoy-
ing, however, if she should not ask me to the Castle for
the battue; for I understood, and gave Dartford to un-
derstand, that I was to accompany my
father.'
At that moment, Lady Rotherwood advanced towards
Mr. and Mrs. Hamlyn, with her parting compliments;
and Walter, overhearing cordial expressions of hospitality,
felt satisfied that all was right.
He was mistaken, however. “I will not hear of her
being left at home,” were the unwelcome words that
met his ear. “ Colonel Hamilton has just been telling
me,” continued the Countess, glancing kindly towards
Lydia, in answer to her mother's excuses for the “unpre-
sented” young lady—“ that she is the most charming
companion in the world --that he does not know how
he should get on without her!"
To refuse this pressing invitation was impossible. But
no sooner had the Rotherwoods departed, and Colonel
Hamilton and the two young sportsmen left the room,
than the wrath of Mr. Hamlyn exploded.
“Lydia invited in place of her brother!" cried he.
“A most unaccountable slight to be offered to my son,
and in, Colonel Hamilton's presence !-But I have to
thank you for it!” he continued, angrily addressing his
wife. “ It is all the result of your mistaken system !
Unable to invite the whole party, it was inevitable
that Lady Rotherwood must give the preference to one
whom you chose to impose upon her as a woman!”
Indeed, dear papa, I would a thousand times rather
stay at home," pleaded Lydia; tears filling her eyes at
hearing, for the first time in her life, her kind mother
reprehended. But Mrs. Hamlyn, dreading to see the
wrath she had incurred transferred to her daughter,
instantly dismissed the offender to her practising.
Next year,” said she, when the door had closed upon
the poor girl, “ Lydia will accompany us everywhere!
and Walter experience the same chance as a super-
numerary.”
“Next year, I shall care nothing about the matter!-
Next year, the Rotherwoods may follow their own
devices. At present, it is essential that Walter should

ton to be wholly above being governed by the notice of
great people," mildly' rejoined Mrs. Hamlyn.
“Not of great people whom he respects," retorted
Hamlyn, biting his lips, which were growing paler and
paler. “Do you suppose that, in the choice of an heir to
his property, he would not be influenced by the worldly
standing of a young man, whom he knows only from
report?
On settling in Warwickshire, he finds us
slighted,--pointedly slighted, -by the leading family of
the neighbourhood; and it was on the courtesies of the
Rotherwoods I depended, as the most effectual counter-
balance to the evil. Look at the result, the result
brought about by your imprudence! The Vernons
are expected down to-day; and in a week's time Hamil.
ton will have discovered us to be on distant terms of
civility, more humiliating than a decided cut!” added
Hamlyn, in a tone of bitterness.
“He is aware that we associate with their equals in
station and respectability," urged his wife.
“Fifty Earls of Rotherwood in distant counties do not
amount in value to Lord Vernon, residing almost in the
same parish. Hamilton will have a right to conclude
that these people know something to my discredit. Ten
to one that, while keeping us at a distance, they will be
extremely civil to him as a stranger in the county."
"I see no possible line of connexion between them.”
“ There is always a line of connexion between country-
neighbours whose lands adjoin ;-foxes to preserve, -
poachers to repel, -trespassers to prosecute. Barlow
threw out a feeler, by his attention about the keys of the
park. Lord Vernon expects to be Lord-lieutenant of
the county; and a man of Hamilton's fortune is always
an object for conciliation."

residence here should become as pleasant as possible."

with ourselves. Consider what might be the consequence,

ment,--making promiscuous acquaintance at watering,
places !—But I neither wish to see him fêted by the
Rotherwoods, at Walter's expense; nor by the Vernons,
in whose house he would be sure to hear us named
slightingly."
By the Vernons, I am convinced, his opinion would
be uninfluenced,” cried Mrs. Hamlyn, warmly.
"Few people are sufficiently firm to remain uninfluenced
by hearing persons daily disparaged. At all events, to
become intimate at the Hyde would estrange him from
our fireside, where it is essential to me he should be
anchored,-at least till Walter's interests are secure. I
shall give him vaguely to understand, however, that my
son avoided an invitation to Rotherwood Castle."
The wistful expression of Mrs. Hamlyn's countenance
evinced her disgust at any attempt at imposition on their
frank-hearted friend. But her husband might have spared
his mancuvres. At the desire of Colonel Hamilton, the
two young men, in the course of their morning's shooting,
had taken luncheon at Burlington; and while pledging his
cordial host in an equally cordial bumper of old Madeira,
Lord Dartford's discontents had burst forth.
“ And so, my dear sir,” cried he, to Colonel Hamilton,
“this audacious aunt and uncle of mine have invited
you
to a battue, and presumed to omit Walter and myself?
I feel outrageously insulted, both in my own person and
my friend's. What can they mean by it? Though I
had the ill-luck to shoot Lord Rotherwood's favourite
setter by mistake, the last time I entered his preserves,
I sha'n't stand being snubbed by my lawful uncle.
Unless he make amends by an early invitation, I have
serious thoughts of cutting him off with a shilling!"
“ Never mind, never mind,” was Colonel Hamilton's
cheerful exhortation, in reply. “If this weather last,
you'll have little to regret in the battue; and if it don't,
why, as you informed me you had given up an expedi-
tion to Italy, this winter, solely for the sake of fox-hunt-
ing, you'll amuse yourself a plaguy deal better with the
Ormeau hounds than in shooting the Earl's setters.”
“I do prefer hunting to shooting, certainly; and
I suppose my uncle makes that preference a pretext

77
for his rudeness," cried Lord Dartford. « But there
would have been no harm in giving one the option, eh,
Hamlyn?" continued he, addressing Walter, who was
deep in his own reflections and a chicken-pie. “For my
part, I would give the best run the Duke of Elvaston is
likely to have this season, for the certainty of a pleasant
party, such as will be assembled next week at Rotherwood
Castle."
“Oh, oh!" cried Colonel Hamilton, who, like most
jovial old gentlemen, was apt to suspect a pretty girl as
the latent object of every good-looking young gentleman,
" I'm beginning to see now what sort of bird you're want-
ing to wing, at Rother'ood Castle! But it that's the
case, why not be satisfied where
you
are? Haven't
you
the
game
in
your own hands, pray, at Dean Park ?”
Walter Hamlyn, shocked by the indiscretion of this
allusion, yet aware that, to silence the old man's reckless
garrulity when once an idea had taken possession of his
fancy, was out of the question, attempted to change the
conversation by exaggerated praise of the pale ale. But
the attention of Colonel Hamilton was not so easily
diverted.
Ay, ay! I knew Bass would make a convert of
of you in time,” cried he. “Worth hogsheads of your
heavy home-brewed! The Dean Park ale sends me to
sleep, like one of Twaddlem's speeches. I'm expecting
my new sledge over from Birmingham," continued he,
turning to the Marquis ; "and by George! my dear lord,
you and Miss Lydia shall have the seasoning on't. I'll
send it to Dean to-morrow after breakfast; and as the park
roads are famously beaten by the coals they've been lead-
ing this morning, you can't do better than refresh my
old eyes with a sight of you both, by driving to Burling-
ton to lunch. A snug drive in the snow, eh? No
cross chaperon, no fussy governess ;-only two happy
young faces glowing in the frosty air.- Well! what say
ye to my proposition ?”
“A tempting one, certainly," replied Lord Dartford,
more embarrassed than he had ever felt in his life by this
indiscreet allusion, in the presence of Lydia's brother, to
a preference he had scarcely yet avowed, even to himself.

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
“The only obstacle is the improbability of Miss Hamlyn's
accepting it; and the impossibility of my even venturing
to name it at Dean Park."
“Pho, pho, pho! What is there to prevent two
young people from enjoying a harmless diversion, who
have a mind to each other's company?-A hundred
miles, too, from the prying and scandal-mongering of
Lon'on ?- Where's the harm of a drive, I should like to
know ?"
“None, I hope, my dear. sir,” cried Lord Dartford,
rising from table, and snatching up his shooting cap, to
depart. “For which reason, I trust you will not forget
your
kind offer of the sledge, that I may make an attempt
to enjoy one with Mrs. Hamlyn, if she will do me the
honour of trusting my sledgemanship. Priority of age,
you know! Mrs. Hamlyn and I, first; her son and
daughter next. I have a year and two months the
advantage over Walter, and claim precedency with the
new toy. Come, Hamlyn, we shall have just time for the
coveys we marked down in the turnips, as we go home.”
On their way back to Dean Park, Walter Hamlyn
made divers attempts at apology for the eccentricities of
their host. But Dartford discouraged all by pronouncing
him, in round terms, to be “a capital old fellow.”
“What an acquisition you must find him in your
thin
neighbourhood !" exclaimed the Marquis. “When I
heard from Cossington that you were to have the Vernons
here this winter, I really pitied you. Lady Vernon and
her daughter are the two most restless, plotting women
of my acquaintance. Lord Vernon is a pompous cipher,
and 'in-the-name of the Prophet, Figs' sort of fellow;
and Alberic, a Frenchified prig. I could not stand such
neighbours as the Vernons. But this pleasant, open-
hearted old soldier is really a resource.
Walter Hamlyn, the ambition of whose life was
to become the bosom friend of the Frenchified prig,-
the favoured admirer of the restless, plotting girl, -re-
plied evasively that, as the Vernons lived chiefly in
Northumberland, and there were election-feuds between
the families, their comings or goings were a matter of no
moment to Dean Park.


## p. 79 (#89) ##############################################

OR, COURT AND CITY.
79
So thoroughly disingenuous, however, was this state-
ment, that, at that very moment, the banker was en-
gaged in deliberating on the day and hour, when, with-
out compromise of his dignity, he could leave a card upon
the unconciliating peer with whom he was forced to keep
up the semblance of neighbourship; tidings having already
reached him that the family coach of the Vernons had been
seen making its dogged way along the Ovington road, bring-
ing the august family to spend a grumphy winter at the
Hyde.
Though the Marquis's definition of Lord Vernon was
somewhat exaggerated, it would have been difficult to point
out a man less happy in himself, or less disposed to ad-
minister to the happiness of others. A victim to the moral
dyspepsia arising from the repletion of prosperity, the
great man murmured away his useless life; ringing the
golden bells of his gorgeous rattle to as doleful a tone as
though they were solemnizing a funeral.
The sullen discontent of his lordship did not rise indeed
to the dignity of misanthropy; or pretend to base itself
on consciousness of personal superiority. But whereas
his father, the late lord, had enjoyed estates to the
value of thirty thousand a-year, he thought himself a
much injured man to succeed to two-thirds only of that
amount, in consequence of the absorptions of a long
dowagerhood and superabounding family of brothers and
sisters. But had Lord Vernon been quite candid with
himself, which few people are in this world, he would
have admitted that his chief quarrel with destiny consisted
in the good old age to which his father had survived.
“I did not come into my property," was one of his
favourite complaints," till I was past the age for enjoying
it.” To which he did not think it necessary to add that,
when at length made a happy man by the death of his
octogenarian parent, he had considerably encumbered
an already diminished rent-roll, by the amount of his
post-obits.
Concerning the only real calamity of his life he was
equally silent ;-that, soon after attaining his majority,
he had become a dupe to the designs of a fashionable
match-hunter: who, having falsely estimated the eldest

TIIE BANKER'S WIFE;
son of a peer having already numbered threescore years,
as an excellent parti, resented it almost as a crime, when,
a few years afterwards, the old lord discountenanced
her appraisements by a second marriage, followed by a
numerous progeny. This worldly-minded wife had exer-
cised, through life, considerable influence over the shallow
mind of her husband; and, compelled to pass the first
twenty years of their married life in modest competence,
in lieu of the brilliant existence they had mutually pro-
jected, Lord Vernon, when at length his venerable parent
obliged him by dropping into the grave, had lost the
power of enjoying with due zest the death of his father.
Such was the plain English of his murmurs. Indignant
as he would have been had any one suggested that his
survival might become an obstacle to the pleasures of
his children, his father's length of days had unquestion-
ably been a burthen to him. Let Christian moralists
determine whether such sentiments on the part of an
enlightened man be not more culpable than the outrages
of physical violence so heavily visited, in lower life, by the
rigour of the law.
Until, at the age of forty-five, Lord Vernon accom-
plished the long-coveted enjoyment of what he called in-
dependence,-namely, a house in town, three country-
seats, and a suitable establishment,—his poverty seemed
to afford sufficient subject for his grumblings. His
“wretched allowance" (of three thousand a-year) scarcely
enabling him to enjoy his hunting in Leicestershire,
maintain his son at College, and bestow upon
his pretty
affected daughter her due excess of the superficial accom-
plishments of the day, placed him, in his own estimation,
in indigent circumstances. But on the attainment of
twenty thousand per annum, albeit the annual amount
of seven thousand had been abstracted for evermore from
the family rent-roll by the weakness of the old lord in
favour of his junior branches, it seemed almost time he
should find some more legitimate cause for discontent
than pecuniary distress.
A new evil opportunely presented itself. Government
began to use Lord Vernon almost as ill by its precarious-
ness, as his father had done by his longevity. The ad-

81
ministration to which, for many years past, he had pawned
his vote in parliament, on the private understanding of
receiving an earldom on the death of his father, thought
proper to resign, a few months previous to that long-
procrastinated event. With malice
prepense,
of course.
Ministers could have no stronger incentive for their
resignation than to baffle the ambition of a newly-
inheriting peer!
Conscious that he had forborne to press his father's
advancement to the earldom, solely under an apprehen-
sion that the old man might be tempted to increase the
portions of his eight daughters when promoted into lady-
ships, Lord Vernon felt too angry with himself for having
allowed the long-coveted object to slip through his fingers,
not to contemplate the addition to his family honours
with increased avidity. The gloomy turn of countenance
acquired by brooding over his domestic calamities during
the life-time of the late lord, became, accordingly, more
morose than ever; till the world, unaware of his secret
sources of dissatisfaction, began to attribute to pride his
lordship’s ill-humoured reserve. The surliness of a great
man who has no ostensible cause for being out of sorts,
is usually so attributed.
Nevertheless, the individual supposed by his country-
neighbours to wear so sour a visage simply because
qualified by the peerage, as “ John, fourteenth Lord
Vernon," stood in reality so low in his own conceit, that
he thought himself nothing because unable to accomplish
the coveted object of writing himself down John, the
first Earl; as though he should have lived in vain, unless
he achieved a step of precedency over his predecessor.
The motive of his Lordship’s preference of Vernon
Castle, as a residence, over the Hyde, was of similar in-
stigation. So far from caring about the sociability of the
neighbourhood, or despising the Warwickshire squire-
archy, he took less pleasure in his ancient seat, only
because overshadowed in the county by the superior dis-
tinctions of his noble neighbours at Ormeau. The Duke
of Elvaston was a greater personage than himself, and a
more popular person. Having succeeded to his family
honours at an early age, his grace's connexion with the
G

neighbourhood was an affair of forty years long; and he
had, consequently, obliged twenty times as many people
as Lord Vernon, and given away ninety and nine times
as many haunches of venison to the rich, and chaldrons
of coals to the poor. Moreover, the duke had one of the
best seats in England, and was master of a crack pack of
fox-hounds; and Lord Vernon, even had he been a
worthier and better-tempered man, might have vainly
attempted to contend against these Great British ele-
ments of popularity:
Next to the superior greatness of Ormeau, Lord Vernon
was jealous of the officious activity of Dean Park. In
his rare visits to the Hyde, during the lifetime of his
father, he had always felt annoyed at meeting among the
guests a man, a mere banker, who presumed to differ in
politics from the House of Vernon; a house already
moss-grown with antiquity, when Dean Park was still an
unenclosed common ;
and now that he bore in his own
person the dignities of the peerage, he intended, by his
chilling reserve, to replace the individual who exercised
such unjustifiable influence in that part of the county, in
the obscurity he considered to be his appropriate element.
The Duke of Elvaston was, in short, the upas over his
head, and Hamlyn the fungus under his feet.
The offspring of Lord and Lady Vernon partook of
the nature of their parents, and were of the world,
worldly. To form a desirable matrimonial connexion
was the object of the one; to avoid a disadvantageous
one, of the other. From the day Lucinda Vernon was
presented, it had been the absorbing ambition of the
débutante and her mother to hail her a Marchioness; and
the son of the Duke of Elvaston happening to be married,
they mutually shared Lord Vernon's antipathy to a
neighbourhood presenting no facilities for the realization
of their project.
Under such circumstances, the beautiful seat of the
Hyde might, perhaps, have been altogether deserted by
its ungrateful proprietor, but for the influence of the son
and heir over the mind of his mother. Alberic Vernon,

teeism that might have the effect of excluding his father

83
from the lord-lieutenancy, which he represented as a step
towards the earldom, continued to bring his parents,
during the hunting season, within reach of the advantages
of Ormeau.
That the environs of the Hyde contained more than
the Ormeau fox-hounds, not one of the party cared to
remember. The indigenous families were no more in
their estimation than the oaks or beeches of the district
-its cauliflowers or spinach. With the exception of the
Hamlyns of Dean Park, none of them were even specific
enough to be hateful.
Whenever questioned in Northumberland or town
touching their Warwickshire neighbours, Lady Vernon
or Lucinda would reply—“we have no one with whom
we can associate; being out of visiting distance from
Ormeau ;"-while Alberic was often heard to boast that
the sole advantage of the Hyde was its utter isolation.
“No booby squires thereabouts,-thank Heaven, to
ride over the hounds, or hook one for their daughters.
We have it all our own way at the Hyde.”
Though Lady Vernon and her daughter had a slight
ball-room acquaintance with Walter Hamlyn, there
seemed so little affinity between the fashionable Captain
of the Blues, and the insignificant family at Dean Park,
that they had actually never been at the trouble of con-
necting him with their Warwickshire opponents.
The Vernons were now visiting the halls of their
ancestors with renewed disgust. Her ladyship and her
daughter had been vainly attempting to persuade Lord
Vernon into passing the winter in Italy, in order to
follow up at Rome what they fancied to be one of the
promising match-hunts of the London season; while his
lordship, frustrated in his hopes that a change of ministry
was about to renew his prospects of promotion, felt more
than usually aggrieved by the limited number of balls in
his coronet. At such a moment, it required all the
selfish
perseverance of
young
Vernon to determine his
father to come and be shone upon by the superior
resplendence of Ormeau.
My dear Inda, we must make some sacrifices to your
brother!"-was Lady Vernon's reply to the peevish re-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
monstrances of the young lady.
“ Alberic cannot of
course dispense with his hunting, -it is the chief business
of life to a young man of his age; and were your father to
enable bim to set up an independent establishment at the
Hyde, we should be having him marry, or do some silly
thing or other. No great sacrifice for us to spend six
weeks there! Indeed, as we always get ill with the damp
or dulness of the place, it will afford an excellent excuse
for taking a house at Brighton, for Easter, to recruit.
“I suppose, then, we must make the best of it,” sighed
Miss Vernon, shrugging her shoulders. “One comfort
is that there is no visiting - -no going out--no call upon
one's attention. So, with plenty of new novels from
Hookham's, and a new piece of braidwork from Brydon's,
I must labour through my period of penance."
Before the expiration of a couple of days, the young
lady began to assert this with less certainty of survival.
Never had the Hyde appeared so unsupportable. The
weather was against them. A deep snow confined the
Ormeau hounds to their kennel, and Lord Vernon and
his son to their fireside ; and Lucinda had all the
ennui of her brother to support, in addition to her own.
Lady Vernon, too, still smarting under her disappoint-
ments of the season in the non-marriage of her daughter,
was forced to listen, hour after hour, to the ejaculations
of the listless, useless, graceless husband, who protested,
that, from the moment he was born, he had been a foot-
ball for the fates, and thwarted in all the objects of
his life.
"It only required for me to determine to spend a few
weeks at the Hyde, to bring such a winter as this !"
grumbled Lord Vernon, as he stood roasting himself
before the breakfast-room fire. “ But 'tis the last time
I ever risk the annoyance. It is too absurd to be
making the sacrifice of one's time and health in this
detestable house, on pretence of giving Alberic his
hunting, when the hounds will probably not be out of
their kennel half a dozen times in as many weeks.”
“My father always labours to impress upon me the
vast self-sacrifice of his visit here,” was the comment on
this text, after Lord Vernon had left the room, of one

who had been taught by his own parents the lesson of
unfiliality. “But, after all, what but his own stinginess
brings us to the Hyde ? Were he to make a proper
addition to my allowance, nothing would be more agree-
able to me than to spend the winter at Melton. The
Ormeau hounds are a very fair pack,—the Ormeau county
is tolerable. But as Dartford was saying yesterday, the
idea of comparing them with Melton is
"Dartford ?" interrupted Lady Vernon, to whom,
though apparently engaged in perusal of the “Morning
Post,” her son's observations were addressed.
“He was saying to me yesterday, I observed,” resumed
her son, “that if
“Lord Dartford was saying to you yesterday?" again
remorselessly interrupted her ladyship. “Why, where
on earth did you see him ?”
“At Ovington.”
Changing horses, I suppose !—I fancied he was half
way to Italy by this time."
“He could not get leave, I fancy, for the scheme fell to
the ground. He has been staying in this neighbourhood.”
“At Ormeau, of course. How unreasonable, Alberic,
that your father should persist in being on such un-
sociable terms with those people! It is very well to give
out in the neighbourhood that we come here for retire-
ment, and do not wish to go out on account of your
father's gout and so forth. But there might surely be
found some plea of exception for the Elvastons.”
“I don't see why. Warwickshire people are unexcep-
tionably odious; and the Ormeau set worst of all. As
far as sporting goes, the Duke is a valuable man; but
his family are bores of the first magnitude. Those
dreadful Irish nieces of the Duchess are quartered at
the Castle regularly every hunting season, in hopes that
some unhappy fellow may be netted during a long frost,
or when laid up with a broken collar-bone. No, no, my
father is quite right to relieve us from the hospitalities
of Ormeau.”
“ You do not consider for a moment the interests of
your sister," cried Lady Vernon, pettishly.
“What advantage could Inda possibly derive at Or-

meau ? Cossington is married, poor fellow! and all the
young men in the house are marked with a white cross,
to be cut down for the Irish nieces."
“You well know, however, what attention he paid to
Inda last season."
"Cossington ?"--
“What nonsense I am talking of Lord Dartford.”
“But what has Dartford to do with the Elvastons,
mother?"
“You said you spoke to him yesterday, on his road from
Ormeau ?”
6 Indeed I said no such thing."
“ What did you say, then ?",
« That he advised me strongly to join him in February,
at Melton.”
“But where has he been staying in Warwickshire ?”
“At Hamlyn the banker's.'
“ How very strange !-- He can't be in difficulties
already!- What takes him to a banker's, I wonder ?”
“The son is in the Blues; and Dartford is in Hamlyn's
troop."
“That good-looking Captain Hamlyn we met at dinner
at Elvaston House ?"
“Precisely."
Why did you never tell me so before? We ought
to return those Dean Park people's visit. The grandfather
was a friend of the late Lord Vernon.
“Grandfather?-I thought they were people of yes-
terday.”
“And so they are. But Lord Vernon was what is called
a good neighbour; that is, caring not a straw with whom
he associated, so that he was sure of society. But I really
believe these Hamlyns are inoffensive, good sort of people.
How long was Lord Dartford there ?"
“I did not ask him. Some days, I believe."
“How very provoking !"
“Why provoking ?”
“Because we have been sitting over the fire for the last
two mornings, wearying our hearts and souls out for want
of something to do; and might just as well have driven
to Dean Park.”

" In such weather?”
“ What signifies weather when one has an object in
view."
“It signifies very much to the horses. And what
object can you possibly have in driving, in a deep snow,
to call on a vulgar banker's vulgar wife ?"
“To invite Lord Dartford here."
“ Take out your horses and servants in such weather,
to accomplish what a note by the post would have settled
equally well ?”
“I beg your pardon. I should have had no objection
to ask him to the Hyde, in an off-hand sort of way. But
on the terms we are, I do not choose to write him a
formal invitation. You know yourself, Alberic, what
remarks you always make when asked to a country-house
where there are unmarried daughters.”
That is, what remarks you make, mother, which I am
forced to echo. However, if you really wish to invite
Dartford in what you call an off-hand sort of way (of all
impromptus fait à loisir the most treacherous—a positive
have still time. I met him yesterday
at Ovington, not, as you surmised, changing horses; but
simply shopping for the people at Dean Park, buying
a skein of white worsted, or some nonsense of that
description. He won't be off these three days.”
“What can keep him loitering on in such a house!
Mrs. Hamlyn is a dull, motherly sort of woman; the
daughters are not grown up. My dear Alberic, if
you
are going to the stables, say the carriage will be wanted
after luncheon to drive to Dean."
Mr. Vernon rang the bell, and reiterated the order
to the groom of the chambers.
“I have too much regard for old Robson to make his
wig stand on end by such an order !” said he. And on
pretence of letters to write he proceeded to shut himself
up in his own room, to enjoy the morning in an easy
chair
before the fire; his dog at his feet, a cigar in his mouth,
and in his hand the last new novel of Eugène Sue; while,
furred to the chin, and with their feet ensconced in well-
warmed Chancelières, his mother and sister set forth upon
their Arctic expedition.

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
CHAPTER VI.
“If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows that he is no island
cut off from other lands, but a continent joined to them. If he easily pardon and
remit offences, it shows that his mind is planted above injuries."-BACON.
LITTLE aware of the motive of Lady Vernon's unusual
condescension, Mrs. Hamlyn received her guests with a
quiet courtesy that not even her husband's ardent desire
to conciliate the family at the Hyde had ever availed to
render servile. She was sincere, however, in her expres-
sions of regret that her ladyship should have attempted
so long a drive in weather so severe, for the ceremony of
a morning visit.
“I had business at Ovington, and a mile or two less
makes no great difference," was the ill-bred explanation
of the manœuvring lady; afraid that her latent object
might be suspected, and scarcely knowing how to intro-
duce the name of Lord Dartford, and ascertain whether
her son's information were correct. For already she
perceived herself mistaken in the supposition that the
banker's wife would be unable to refrain from allusions
to so desirable a guest.
Mrs. Hamlyn's polite expressions of satisfaction at the
return of the Vernon family to the Hyde were met with
an equally ill-grace.
“We scarcely hoped to have the pleasure of seeing your
ladyship in Warwickshire this winter," observed the
hostess. The newspapers announced that you were on
the point of starting for Italy."
Pray do not mention it. The disappointment was
too trying !” interrupted Miss Vernon, with an affected
sigh. “ After anticipating the delights of that charming
climate, a winter in Warwickshire seems doubly insup-
portable. I do believe it always snows at the Hyde.
Every Christmas we have spent there, at least, the snow
has been a foot deep on the ground.”

And both mother and daughter fell upon their family
place as ferociously as though poor Mrs. Hamlyn were
accountable for the crimes and misdemeanours of the
county!
"For my part, I suffered so severely from rheumatism
the last winter I spent at the Hyde,” resumed Lady Ver-
non, languidly, "that I had made up my mind never
again to set foot in the house ; unless in summer, as a
resting-place on our way to the North.”
“ The house is, certainly, better adapted for a summer
residence," replied Mrs. Hamlyn, scarcely considering it
civil to be too severe on the family-seat of her visitor.
“Better adapted ?—Say rather more bearable!" retorted
Miss Vernon, with a shudder. “ The Hyde is adapted
for nothing, unless to figure in one of Charlotte Smith's
old-fashioned novels. I found one yesterday in the
library, describing the place as though the Hyde had sat
for its picture!"
It would, however, have been cruel on my son to
leave him alone there, his first winter in England,” added
Lady Vernon. “ Alberic is passionately fond of hunting;
and in these days, everything is sacrificed to young people
and by young people to their pleasures. _I dare say you
have the mortification to find that Dean Park owes a con-
siderable portion of its attraction in the eyes of Captain
Hamlyn to the vicinity of Ormeau ?”
This was the longest and civilest speech Mrs. Hamlyn
had ever yet heard from the lips of Lady Vernon; who
had not deigned to notice, on previous occasions, her rela-
tionship to Walter.
“My son is certainly fond of hunting," was Sophia's
meek reply. “But later in the season, he usually enjoys
a few weeks at Melton.”
“He is with you, however, at present, I believe ?”
resumed Lady Vernon, fancying she was veering round
unperceived towards the Marquis.
“He will be here, I hope, till next week.”
“In that case, pray tell him he must lose no time in
riding over to see us at the Hyde,” was the gracious
rejoinder of the great lady. *Alberic and Captain
Hamlyn were schoolfellows. But there is some dif.

between them; and my son has been so
little in England, that he has had no opportunity of
cultivating the acquaintance of young men of his own
standing; a circumstance I regret more especially in
the case of those connected with him by country-neigh-
bourship. Perhaps Captain Hamlyn will come over to-
morrow, without ceremony, and dine and sleep at The
Hyde? I am expecting my sister, Lady Middlebury,
and her family."
- My son would doubtless have had much pleasure in
accepting your ladyship's invitation," replied the asto-
nished Mrs. Hamlyn, "but-
Terrified by the sound of a demur so sinister to her
hopes, Lady Vernon, interrupting her hostess, recom-
menced her attack.
“Lord Vernon would have done himself the honour
of calling on Mr. Hamlyn, or accompanying me here to-
day," said she, “but he has unfortunately symptoms of
gout which confine him to the house. The last time he
was at the Hyde, he experienced a severe attack.”
“My son would, I am sure, have had great pleasure in
waiting upon his lordship without any preliminary of the
kind,” resumed Mrs. Hamlyn, unable to account for this
excess of courtesy, “but, at present, we have a friend
staying in the house."
"In that case, it will only give us additional pleasure
if he will consent to accompany Captain Hamlyn," added
Lady Vernon.
“But I fear I must now ask leave to ring
for my carriage," said she, with sudden recollection; “my
coachman made it an earnest request, in behalf of his
horses, that he might not have to put up in
your warm
stable, for so short a time; and I do not like to keep him
old
man,
in this bitter weather."
“There is always more fuss about horses taking cold
than human beings!" observed Miss Vernon, aside to
Lydia, (with whom she had been exchanging a few insig.
nificant sentences in hopes to avoid overhearing the
mention of Lord Dartford's name ;) while the simple-
hearted girl, in her plain morning-dress, sat contemplating
with admiration the number of ways and means by which
fru could be rendered ornamental to the human form

divine, as exemplified in the fanciful winter-dress of a
London belle.
* You will, I hope, have the goodness to express all
this to Captain Hamlyn and his friend,” added Lady
Vernon-her guilty conscience rendering the name of the
Marquis unpronounceable. “We dine at seven-a liberal
But it will be perhaps better if I write the hour
on the two cards I was about to leave in the hall, on the
part of Lord Vernon.”
“I can only promise to deliver them,” observed Mrs.
Hamlyn, while her guest, who had risen to take leave,
hastily inscribed in pencil on the visiting-cards the date of
the invitation. “The gentlemen must, of course, answer
for themselves."
“Since you have kindly consented to part with them, I
consider the engagement accepted,” said Lady Vernon, a
tall, square-shouldered, law-laying-down woman, to whom,
when she chose to carry a point, it seemed difficult to
persist in opposition. “One really has scruples about
sending men and horses across the country with super-
fluous notes, at such a season !- Unless, therefore, I hear
to the contrary, we shall expect the honour of seeing Cap-
tain Hamlyn and his friend to-morrow, to dine and sleep
at the Hyde."
With a shake of the hand fully qualified to frost-bite the
fingers of Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughter, the Vernons
now took leave.
“What extremely disagreeable people! And what
could bring them out to call upon us in such weather!"
exclaimed Lydia, the moment the carriage drove from the
door, this being Miss Hamlyn's first interview with the
family.
“ It is not always easy to dive into the motives of so
worldly awoman as Lady Vernon," was her mother's reply.
“That she had some unavowed motive, I fear I must
conclude; for she is a person who acts upon no ordinary
impulses of good-nature. Lord Vernon may wish to
conciliate your father concerning some election difficulty;
or there is some private bill, perhaps, he wants to carry
through the House. I know they are talking of enclosing
Alderbam Gorse."

“In that case, surely papa would have been included in
the invitation ? It seems almost rude that Lady Vernon
should pointedly omit him, yet invite others out of his
house.'
Had
your
father been invited, we must all have been
included in the party; and with the present family at
the Hyde, we are only on terms of rare and formal dinner-
parties. We have never been offered beds. With Walter,
they may relax from these formalities. They meet him
everywhere in town. He was at Eton with young Vernon.
They will probably establish a footing of intimacy with
your brother."
“I only trust Walter will have the spirit to refuse !
Become intimate with people who have keptsystematically
aloof from his parents!”
When
you
have seen more of the world, Lydia, you
will find that those who devote themselves exclusively to
high society, (as Walter seems inclined to do,) do not ana-
lyze too curiously the motives of their associates. Walter
must take the Vernon civilities as he finds them, or he
will not find them at all."
“But why not dispense with them ?--Surely there is
nothing very charming in the family ?"
“Miss Vernon and her brother are the only young
people in the neighbourhood. When Mr. Vernon mar-
ries, his father will perhaps establish him at the Hyde.
It is certainly desirable that your brother, as the future
owner of Dean, should be on amicable terms with so near
a neighbour."
"From something Lord Dartford said yesterday, I
should think Mr. Vernon never would marry!" observed
Lydia. “He fancies, it seems, that every young lady he
sees has designs upon him; and is constantly refusing
invitations, and running away from country-houses, on
pretence that the family is trying to entrap him into a
match !"
“Did Lord Dartford tell you all this ?” inquired Mrs.
Hamlyn, with a heightened colour, vexed that a tone of
such familiar pleasantry should have established itself,
without her knowledge, between the young Marquis and
her daughter.

“No, mamma! He told me nothing. While he was
here, nothing passed between us you did not hear. But
yesterday, the billiard-room door being open while I sat
reading in the library, I heard Lord Dartford mention to
my brother that he had met Mr. Vernon at Ovington,
(when he rode over to inquire for letters,) and had almost
persuaded him to take Dean Park his
way
home to the
Hyde.”
“I am very glad he did not!” ejaculated Mrs. Hamlyn.
Walter, however, seemed vexed that Mr. Vernon had
not accepted the proposal; and spoke of inviting him to
dine and sleep here, the first time the hounds met in the
neighbourhood. He won't come ! observed Lord Dart-
ford, continuing his game. Why not?' rejoined my
brother. · Because Alberic never shows his nose in a
country-house where there is an unmarried daughter.'
Walter laughed at the idea of a child like myself being
an obstacle to the movements of Mr. Vernon. “And why
not?' persisted Lord Dartford. As there is nothing to
prevent your sister becoming his wife, except that Miss
Hamlyn appears to have too good taste to throw herself
away on a prig, I am pretty sure he would order post-
horses and fly the country, on the strength of your invi-
tation ! Both Lord Dartford and Walter then began to
quiz Mr. Vernon as a coxcomb. So that, in spite of Lady
Vernon's anxiety to promote her son's intimacy with
Walter, and spare
the
exposure of our groom to the wea-
ther she was not afraid to encounter, I fear an excuse will
have to be forwarded to-night across Braxham Ferry !"
“ Most probably; but from Colonel Hamilton—not
from
your brother. I am persuaded Walter will go. Even
were he disinclined for the party, his father would per-
suade him.”
At that moment Mr. Hamlyn, who had been occupied
with business in his justice-room, made his appearance to
inquire the purport of Lady Vernon's visit; and in the
consciousness of having just uttered his name, the cheeks
of his wife became suffused at his sudden entrance.
The suspicions of the mistrustful man were instantly
awakened. Certain that he was the subject of the conver-
sation which had stopped short on his arrival, and, unac-

customed at present to regard his daughter as more than
achild, he could not support the idea of confidence between
Lydia and her mother, in which his name had mention.
Lady Vernon appears to have communicated very
astounding intelligence,” said he, examining the counte-
nances of both, with a degree of severity that increased
their confusion.
“She surprised me, certainly,” replied Mrs. Hamlyn,
trying to rally her spirits, “ by coming out in such weather
merely to invite Colonel Hamilton and Walter to dine
to-morrow at the Hyde !"
“ Colonel Hamilton ?--Why, they are not even ac-
quainted,” retorted her husband.
“She left Lord Vernon's card for him in proper form,
and a written invitation for both.”
“Very unaccountable!" cried Mr. Hamlyn, shrugging
his shoulders, stung with his usual jealousy at the idea of
the nabob receiving attentions likely to extend his con-
nexions with society. A moment's reflection, however,
suggested that, since it was impossible to suppress the
invitation, his best policy was to assume the credit of
having suggested the civility of the Vernons towards a
friend and guest of his family.
“I have to ask a favour of you, my dear Colonel,” cried
he, addressing the old gentleman, who at that moment
made his appearance, with Walter, after whom he had
been hobbling in his morning's duck-shooting. “Lord
Vernon is anxious you should waive ceremony, as a
country neighbour, and accompany my son to-morrow,
in a friendly way, to dine and sleep at the Hyde. His
lordship is an invalid, or would have made the invitation
in person. Lady Vernon, however, has been here as his
delegate, entreating Mrs. Hamlyn's interference to obtain
your assent.”
Poor Lydia, amazed at this fluent exposition, gazed
in utter consternation, first at her father, and then
upon
the old gentleman it purported to deceive.
“It was my Lady Vernon's carriage then we saw
passing the Lodge, as we came out of Woodsfield Hanger?"
cried he. “Such folly, such ostentation !--Outriders in
a frost that might split a flint!"

“She came only to leave these two cards of invitation
for yourself and my son,” resumed Mr. Hamlyn, in an
extenuating tone.
Walter, who had been disencumbering himself of his
shooting paraphernalia in the hall, now entered, his hand-
some face radiant with exercise, to receive his share of
the explanation. But the self-possessed London man was
cautious not to betray his surprise.
“Very cool, upon my word,” said he, "to fancy one
would leave a comfortable fireside, in such weather to
join a family dinner-party Walf-a-dozen miles off!”-Satis-
fied that his father would not hear of his refusing an
invitation from the Vernons, and that he should be com-
pelled to follow his inclinations, he threw himself into an
arm-chair with an air of indignation at the unexpected
presumption of the Hyde.
With all the candour of girlhood, Lydia exchanged a
triumphant glance with her mother, exultingly implying,
“You were wrong. My brother has too much spirit, you
see, dear mother, to be at the beck of such people as the
Vernons.”
“It is certainly a somewhat unceremonious invita-
tion," observed Mr. Hamlyn. “But at your age, Walter,
weather or distance seldom form an obstacle to a pleasant
engagement; and Lord Vernon, having known you from
a boy, feels entitled to treat you with greater freedom.”
“But he has not known Colonel Hamilton, sir, from a
boy,” remonstrated Walter; “ạnd I must-
“ Aware of the long-standing friendship between
Hamilton and myself," interrupted the banker," he
builds, perhaps, upon the old adage, the friends of my
friends are my own.' At all events, it is clear that the
liberty he has taken arises from the commendable desire
of establishing a footing of good-neighbourship between
Burlington Manor and the Hyde."
“ 'Tisn't the want of ceremony would prevent my
going,” observed Colonel Hamilton, heartily. 6 On the
contrary, the only thing that pleases me in the invita-
tion is the free-and-easy-style on't, which is better than
I expected from the great Don at the Hyde. I'm begin-
ning to have a handsomer notion of the family, ’pon my

life. However, this weather is not the thing for a long
drive in pumps and silk stockings.”
“ As there are beds offered, you would, of course, drive
over to dress, pleaded Mr. Hamlyn. “My horses could
take you there in forty minutes.'
Lydia fixed her eyes anxiously on the face of the old
man thus plausibly tempted. Though unconscious of
the blunder which had occurred concerning Lord Dart-
ford's invitation, she felt that the warm, frank nature
of her friend would be out of place among these
artificial people. Nothing but awe of her father pre-
vented her from darting forward with an entreaty to
Colonel Hamilton that he would not be beguiled into
a visit to the Hyde.
Aware of his innate sociability, she discerned, with
regret, symptoms of relenting in his countenance. An
invitation of any kind had been for many years so un-
attainable a pleasure to him, that the abstract idea
had not yet lost its charm. He could not bear to say
“no” to any man sufficiently well-disposed towards him
to invite him to dinner.
Well, Master Watty? What say ye to all this ?”
cried he, addressing Captain Hamlyn, who sat balancing
himself with a supercilious air in his chair, divided
between his inclination to snatch the olive-branch ten-
dered by the Vernons, and his dread of appearing at the
Hyde in company with such a Goth as the Colonel.
If you choose to take the chance of a damp bed in
Lord Vernon's old ghost-hole of a Manor-house, I'm
your man! From the day of my arrival in the county,
these people have been doing one civil thing to me or
another. Moreover, this is my first opportunity of seeing
your high-flying London ladies; which, to my notion, is
worth the hazard of a catarrh."
On a hint from his father, Walter suffered himself to
be victimized.
“Unlucky enough," said he, carelessly, as he left the
room to dress for dinner, " that Dartford should have
been forced to hurry away this morning, by the news of
his mother's illness. His being here would have afforded
a pretext for refusing; a pretext not very satisfactory to

country-party in winter time; endeavouring by their
laboured vivacity to disguise the growing oppression of
their spirits.
“After all, we may not find it so dreadfully dull here,"
was Lady Vernon's consolatory apostrophe toher daughter,
on the morning they were expecting their new guests ;
casting an approving glance at the exotics with which
the zealous groom of the chambers had decorated the
apartments, and the blazing fires which diffused a cheer-
ful glow over the costly but gloomy hangings. “Your
father, in one of his fits of hypochondriacism, determined
that, (in consequence of the expenses of Alberic's elec-
tion, and the few miserable fétes he authorized me to give
in London for your débût,) we should have no regular
Christmas-party here, this winter; that is, no one but my
family and his. But the Middleburys will fill the house
for a week, and afford a pretext for inviting stragglers
from the hunt, and persuading Dartford to prolong his
visit. Luckily enough, by the way; for Lord Vernon is.
always so out of spirits or so out of humour, (which he
calls a flying gout,) that, had we been quite alone, I
should scarcely have ventured the invitation.”
"Have you said anything about it to papa ?” inquired
Lucinda, arranging her work-table in elegant confusion,
so as to secure being discovered in a becoming attitude.
"I told him it was indispensable to invite a few young
men; for, if Alberic were our only beau, he would find his
cousins a horrible corvée."
Papa would certainly like few things less than a
match between
my
brother and Susan or Fanny Middle-
bury,” replied Miss Vernon. “Family intermarriages I
have always heard him attack as lopping off the main
branch of a tree.”
“Not more than he disapproved my having invited
young Hamlyn. He has had election-squabbles with the
family, and dislikes the Dean Park people as upstarts
and pretenders."
But
papa
cannot call Lord Dartford an upstart or
pretender ??

to talk to young Hamlyn, therefore, he insisted on having
to dinner to-day the Barlows of Alderham; people whom
we never ask above once during our stay at the Hyde, to
keep up the agent's respectability in the county."
“What a set to meet Lord Dartford !— And do they
come ?"
“The woman Barlow is ill, and excuses herself—(I do
not suppose she finds her visits here very agreeable !)—
The husband accepts, I am happy to say; for he is a
rational sort of person, who helps one amazingly through
the dinner-talking, and will be at the trouble of answer-
ing Sir Henry Middlebury's eternal questions. One is
obliged to have somebody belonging to the house quali-
fied to discuss farming and poor-laws for the country
gentlemen, which Lord Vernon will not trouble himself
to do.”
“Sir Henry is certainly a dreadful bore," observed
Lucinda. “And then he looks so like a churchwarden,-
80 spruce, wiggy, and respectable. But how are we to
manage, dear mamma, about Lord Dartford? Of course
he must take you out, and Aunt Middlebury and Fanny
will sit on either side papa.- But pray tell Alberic to place
Susan Middlebury on the side opposite the fire; upon
which, on pretence of being cold, I can take the vacant
place next to Lord Dartford. Sir Henry, who will take
me in to dinner, is much too great a wiseacre to notice
what is going on.”
Scarcely was the plan of the opening campaign
adjusted, when the clang of the hall-bell became
audible.
“The Middleburys so early ?"-exclaimed Miss Ver-
“What manque d'usage !"
“ They could not well manage otherwise,” said Lady
Vernon. “My sister wrote me word they were to sleep
at Uplands, which is only thirty miles from hence; and,
being obliged to start after breakfast, as there was a
party in the house, she is forced to arrive here an hour
too soon.
With her sister, she felt privileged to take
such a liberty."
The Middleburys were not people qualified to make
the embarrassing 'hour when newly-arriving guests are
non.

neither at home nor company pass more pleasantly.
Indeed, there was something in the hollowness and heart-
lessness of the Vernons which imposed constraint even
on their family connexions. Sir Henry was simply a
painstaking, solemn country-gentleman; so eager to do
everything in the right way, and according to the most
approved principles, that he stretched himself upon a rack
of perpetual experiment. Absorbed in the study of all
the new systems and patent inventions of the day, he
was either absent in society, or roused himself only to bore,
people, by his crotchety speculations, till they cordially
wished him absent.
His lady-wife was a collet monté and rigid education-
monger; who, having lived for the last twenty years in a
severe course of governesses and masters, regarded her:
two pretty daughters rather as the result of her excellent
Trimmerism, than as pleasant companions or affectionate
children. Every careless word uttered by Susan and
Fanny, was submitted by their mother to rigid analysis,
and referred back to some entry in her education-ledger.
Any rash notice of a rainy-day was connected by mamma
with their early doses of Mrs. Marcet's Conversations on
Atmospherical Phenomena ; nor could Susan take out
her leaded netting-cushion, without producing a cross-
examination from her mother on the first principles of
mechanics, as imbibed (with her bread and milk) from the
Dialogues of Joyce.
The two girls, though naturally cheerful, unaffected
creatures, had consequently become as stiff and starched
as the farthingaled Maids of Honour of Queen Elizabeth.
This was their first visit to the Hyde; and, being still
guiltless of a London season, they stood in considerable
awe of their cousin, Lucinda Vernon, whom they knew
to be one of the fashionable beauties of the day. Seated
on the edges of their chairs, glancing ever and anon at
Lady Middlebury for signals to regulate their answers
and deportment, the two poor girls looked almost as much
in torment as if undergoing the process of thumb-screwing.
Miss Vernon was, however, in the mood to be gracious,
even to her country cousins. Fluttered into high spirits
by Lord Dartford's unexpected arrival in Warwickshire,

she entertained little doubt of bagging her bird, while
thus sporting on her own manor, and backed by her own
keepers. A high-bred girl is never seen to greater
advantage than when assisting to do the honours of her
father's country-house; and the good-humoured, open
character of Dartford rendering it indispensable to
eschew all imputation of coldness or hauteur, slie wel-
comed Susan and Fanny as warmly as though she were
about to stand for their county, inquired cousinishly
after their little brothers and sisters, hoped they had
brought their music with them, and tried to beguile the
time till the dressing-bell by exhibiting the facetiæ of
Messrs. Jabot, Vieuxbois, Crépin, De la Linottière, and
divers other albums of platitudes invented to supply topics
of conversation for a tongue-tied country-house.
The two simple-hearted girls were enchanted. Already,
the numbness engendered by a long drive in a severe
frost, and the repeated exhortations of Lady Middlebury
previous to their arrival that they should sit straight,
hold
up their heads, and attend to the use of the sub-
junctive mood, was beginning to give way; and the long-
dreaded visit to Aunt and Uncle Vernon, which was to
be the crowning probation of their accomplishments, to
lose a portion of its terrors. The Hyde, though men-
tioned in history, and engraved in picture-books, was no
such very alarming place, after all; and, provided their
cousin Alberic, the travelled man, did not examine them
very severely in their Italian and German, or Lord and
Lady Vernon stand behind them during their execution
of their grand duet in C Minor, they trusted they might
get through their week without much agony of body or
soul.
Just, however, as they were becoming acclimatized to
the snug morning-room, and beginning to wonder whether
the chaise-seats were unpacked and the maid waiting in
their dressing-room, in stalked Lord Vernon; looking a
thousand domestic tragedies, with the countenance of
Count Ugolino on the eve of devouring his offspring.
In vain did the Middleburys rise from their seats to
be welcomed and noticed. With every previous dis-
position to bear with fortitude the visitation of his wife's

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
of their danoOtherwise than as the declared lover
family, his Lordship could scarcely command his feelings
sufficiently to be civil.
“Will you be so very obliging as to peruse t
this, and
explain its meaning ?" said he, addressing Lady Vernon
in a tone of wounded dignity, startling even to his un-
impressible daughter, and placing an open note in her
hand; whereupon, the lady of the house, amid the
general silence of the room, cast her eyes over a few
lines, indited on thick wire-wove, in a clerkly hand, to
the following tremendous purport:-
Dean Park, Thursday Morning.
“ Colonel Hamilton and Captain Hamlyn will have
the honour of dining with Lord and Lady Vernon this
day, at half-past seven; and of accepting her Ladyship’s
polite offer of beds at The Hyde."
Nothing very obscure or involved in the phrasing of
the note! Yet, succinct and straightforward as it was,
Lady Vernon chose to read it over a second time, ere she
formed any very decided conclusions about the matter;
and, on once more attaining the full stop following the
fatal words “The Hyde,” almost wished it could have
been prolonged into the prolixity of one of Sir Charles
Grandison's epistles, so embarrassing did she find her
situation with regard to her irritated spouse.
The preceding night she had duly announced to Lord
Vernon that the Marquis of Dartford was coming to
join the Middlebury party at The Hyde; hinting that,
with such a snow on the ground, and such a capital
billiard-table in the house, it would be their own fault
if he quitted
of their daughter; which exposition must be fresh in the
remembrance of the indignant Lord Vernon. Nor was
the impression less vivid in her own that, a few days
before their journey into Warwickshire, his Lordship had
observed to her, “we have got a new neighbour at the
Hyde, a purse-proud Nabob, a vulgar friend of Hamlyn,
the banker. I find from Barlow that he has been in-
truding, and making himself troublesome to the keepers;
having, as a tenant of the Burlingtons, been allowed the

103
usual privileges. We must of course exchange cards
with this
person;
but I shall take care that the acquain-
tance goes no further."
And it was after this marital warning, she had to
account for inviting the “purse-proud Nabob” to dine
and sleep in the most familiar manner at The Hyde !
“ There must have been some unfortunate mistake,”
said she; summoning courage for the confession of her
offences. “ Alberic informed me, yesterday, that Lord
Dartford was staying at Dean Park; and I thought the
opportunity a good one for inviting him here. I was
mistaken-my son was mistaken-we were all mistaken.
-My card of invitation appears to have reached the wrong
person.
“Wrong, indeed! The horrible Bengal tiger of Bur-
lington Manor !-However, since it was a mistake, a
mistake it shall remain. I will instantly write and ex-
plain for whom the invitation was really intended. No
occasion for us to be entangled in so unsatisfactory an
acquaintance.”
Certainly not !” burst in faint murmurs from the lips
of all present, in reply to an interrogatory glance, addressed
by Lord Vernon to the circle.
But Lady Vernon, though apparently assentient among
the rest, no sooner saw her husband direct his steps
towards the writing-table, and open the lid of the enve-
lope case, evidently with the most epistolary intentions,
than she experienced qualms of conscience.
“ After all,” said she, “it is no fault of Colonel Hamil-
ton's that Mrs. Hamlyn should have fancied it was him
I intended to designate as 'the friend staying with them
at Dean.'
“I am convinced the whole affair is an impertinent
mystification, preconcerted on the part of the Hamlyns,”
persisted Lord Vernon. “It is only to me such adven-
tures ever happen. I am the most unlucky person in the
world. A man actually invited to dine in my house, whom
I had expressly pointed out to my family as an object of
avoidance!"-
“ Colonel Hamilton is universally respected in the
neighbourhood, I find,” pleaded Lady Vernon. “Even

vague a defi-
Mr. Barlow was mentioning yesterday, how active and
useful they found him as a magistrate."
“ There is, surely, no occasion for me to have all the
useful magistrates in the county quartered in my house?"
snarled her lord, still rustling the blotting-book.
* Any insult offered to such a man, however, would
recoil upon ourselves!"
“Who talked of offering him an insult ? I simply intend
to state that the invitation he received was intended for
the Marquis of Dartford, and that he is under a mistake.”
“Which amounts to a request that he will not come
and dine here to-day What is such a prohibition but
an insult ?” exclaimed Lady Vernon.
“ You should have been more explicit. People cannot
be too explicit about dinner-invitations. So
nition as the friend staying at Dean Park,' might have
brought down upon us something less reputable in the way
of acquaintance than this East India Colonel, even some
of Mr. Hamlyn's city connexions, for instance.”
"It was certainly very careless. On the whole, we may
consider ourselves fortunate that it is no worse,” said
Lady Vernon, trusting that her husband was beginning
to mollify—so very fastidious did he show himself in the
selection of a pen.
“We met Lord Dartford changing horses at Barthorpe
this morning, the first stage from Uplands,” said Sir
Henry Middlebury. "The postmaster asked leave to
give his Lordship the first turn-out, as he had been sent
for express, it seems, to Dartford Hall, the Marchioness
being dangerously ill. I noticed his Lordship’s carriage;
because, to my surprise, it had neither Collinge's axles,
nor grasshopper springs. I was assured that, in London,
no carriages were built now-a-days without Collinge’s
axles and grasshopper springs. I had a new one from
Leader, last year, solely with a view to a crane neck, (the
Comte de Bambis, when he was staying at Middlebury
Park, having been greatly surprised that, with our narrow
turn-in, we should venture on a carriage without a crane-
neck;) and I was beginning to be afraid I was again in the
wròng box, my new coach having neither Collinge’s axles.
nor grasshopper springs. But when I saw that the Mar-

105
quis of Dartford, who, as one of the richest, is, I conclude,
one of the most fashionable young men of the day, had
neither Collinge’s axles nor grasshopper springs, I in-
stantly observed to Lady Middlebury,
If I might venture a remark on the subject,” observed
Lady Vernon aside to her husband, lowering her voice and
leaning over his chair, so as not to interrupt the drowsy
prosification of her brother-in-law, “I should strongly
advise your receiving Colonel Hamilton as though no
error had occurred. Reflect what a triumph it would
afford the people at Dean Park to find that we had been
anxious to attract a guest like young Dartford out of their
house. Think what a history they would make of it, in
their vulgar circles. But if they were able to add that
we had treated with ill-breeding an old gentleman, an old
soldier, guiltless of offence towards us, and no less than
ourselves betrayed into the scrape, the fault would be
wholly on our side, in the opinion of the world.”
“I should certainly be sorry,” replied Lord Vernon,
whose first explosion of ire having subsided, he was
beginning to sink into his usual apathetic distaste for
scenes and explanations, or the exertion of note-writing,
“I should be seriously annoyed, indeed, that any occur-
rence at The Hyde justified Mr. Hamlyn, the banker, in
mixing up my name with the history of his hospitalities
at Dean Park. Perhaps, therefore, on the whole, it will
be best to pass over this offensive mistake as lightly as
possible.”
“A man of Colonel Hamilton's age can never be so
objectionable an acquaintance as a younger person, par-
ticularly as regards Alberic and Inda," pleaded Lady
Vernon, greatly relieved. “Besides, it will be easy to
receive this new neighbour of ours in so formal a man-
ner as to give him little inclination for returning to
The Hyde.
“I believe you are right,” rejoined his lordship, tearing
up the note he had commenced, and crossing the room
to throw the fragments into the fire. “ All that remains
for us is to submit heroically to the evil. If Colonel
Hai ilton an intentional intruder, my coldness will
afford him a sufficient rebuke."

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
The dressing-bell having now rung, the party dispersed;
the poor Middlebury girls panic-struck by the grandeur
of so august an uncle and aunt; and fearing they should
never hold their heads high enough, preserve
sufficient
decorum, or execute the chromatic scale with sufficient
accuracy, for the satisfaction of a family so fastidious.
Such was the circle into which the warm-hearted and
hospitable Colonel Hamilton was about to become an
involuntary intruder.
CHAPTER VII.
“The highest life is oft a dreary void,
A rack of pleasures where we must invent
A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.
Bards may sing what they will about Content!'
Contented,' wlien translated, means but 'cloy'd,'
And hence arise the woes of sentiment."-BYRON.
:
“By George! these nobs know how to manufacture a
pleasant berth for themselves,” exclaimed the Colonel to
his
young companion, when, after emerging from the
long dark avenue, after a drive of three quarters of an
hour over the moonlit snow, they came upon the fine
façade of the venerable mansion, every window of which
seemed radiant with reflected light.
« Your father was
quite right. The distance is a mere trifle. In my fur
cloak, I vow I've been as snug as by my parlour-fire.
After all, what signifies a frost-bitten nợse when a plea-
sant sociable party's in the wind ?”
The glowing hall into which they were now ushered,
and the troop of highly-disciplined servants in attend-
ance, perfected his elation of spirit. It had been settled
that, unaccustomed at present to the ways of the house,
they should arrive dressed for dinner; and, as they had
made their appearance with military exactness, the
drawing-room contained, on the entrance of the punctual
guests, only a blazing fire,-a profusion of light,--and
the morning papers just arrived from town; which the
groom of the chambers officiously placed on the table
nearest the old gentleman, whose liberal housekeeping

107
and open-handed habits secured him far higher renown
in the stewards' rooms of the neighbourhood, than
awaited many a man of loftier announcement.
“The Times of to-day, I vow and declare,” cried
Colonel Hamilton, ensconcing himself in an arm-chair,
which he drew towards the fire, to the detriment of the
symmetrical arrangements of the room. Then, taking
out his spectacles to make himself perfectly comfortable,
“I wonder I never thought of getting down the morning
papers by the day-coach !" said he, addressing over his
shoulder the dismayed Walter, who stood elegant and
graceful on the hearth-rug, in his well-starched white
cravat, and well-cut black coat. Why 'twould have
shortened by half those deuced long winter evenings.
Let these lords alone for taking care of themselves ?
But bless me!-What have we got here?—'OVERLAND
MAIL?' Why 'twasn't expected these three days.-By
George!—By EXTRAORDINARY EXPRESS.' And I
shouldn't have known an item about the matter afore
to-morrow morning, but for coming here.—So, so, so !-"
And, with his legs comfortably crossed, and a heavy
silver candlestick taken from the table interposed between
his spectacled nose and the newspaper,
the Colonel gave
himself up, heart, soul, and body, to the ecstatic enjoy-
ments of a quidnunc,-enjoyments only fully understood
by those who have passed their lives in a remote colony;
when, lo! the drawing-room door was thrown open by
the page, and in stalked Lady Vernon, majestic in point
and black velvet, arrayed in costume and countenance as
for the part of Lady Macbeth. Closely following, came
the Middlebury girls, like her pale and awe-struck maids
in waiting; having been loitering in the vestibule for
want of courage to enter the drawing-room uncoun-
tenanced by one of the family.
Never had the good address of Walter Hamlyn proved
more available than at that moment. His gentlemanly
and unembarrassed manner of accepting the formal wel-
come of the lady of the house placed him at once before
her eyes as Captain Hamlyn of the Blues, the friend of
Lord Dartford, and effaced all trace of the banker's son
of Dean Park; thus affording to the poor old Colonel

leisure to recover his equilibrium, and perform his part,
in due form, in the ceremony of presentation to Lady
Vernon.
It was only the Middleburys who, while Walter was
undergoing the interrogatory of the lofty lady in black
velvet concerning the health of his family, had oppor-
'tunity to note the embarrassed attitude of the startled
guest, not knowing how to disencumber himself of the
silver branch and newspaper, or the spectacles on his
nose, in time to execute his obeisances, with becoming
alacrity, to the lady paramount of The Hyde.
Luckily, the page, who was now holding open the
door for Lady Middlebury, rustling forward, like a ship
in a North Easter, arrayed in a dozen breadths of well-
flounced Gros de Naples, perceived the old gentleman's
embarrassment, and hastened to relieve him of at least
one portion of his burthen; so that, by the time Walter
Hamlyn, after casting an agonized glance at the Colonel
to ascertain his present whereabout, ventured to ask
leave to present to her ladyship Colonel Hamilton, of
Burlington Manor, he was quite prepared to offer his
acknowledgments for the friendly and unceremonious
manner in which, as a new comer into the neighbourhood,
he had been invited by Lord Vernon to his house.
To impute any connivance in a scheme of imposition
i to this out-spoken, gray-headed old soldier, was out of
the question. His delinquency was consequently limited,
for the present, in Lady Vernon's eyes, to the free and
easy manner in which he seemed to recognise his right
to be at home under her roof. Though previously
resolved to meet the friend of Lord Dartford's friend,
with a degree of formal courtesy, rendering it equally
impossible for him to complain or encroach, she had
scarcely patience with the ready freedom with which the
stranger had drawn her own pet fauteuil of ebony en-
crusted with ivory, into the trying blaze of a tremendous
fire, in order to read her own paper by the light of her
own candelabrum.
Sir Henry Middlebury and Lord Vernon soon made
their appearance. Entering the room, side by side, like
the two kings of Brentford, and being unluckily pre-

sented at the same time to the Colonel by his lady
hostess, an involuntary confusion arose in his mind as to
the identity of the parties. He knew not which was
Prince Volscius-- which Prince Pretyman; and Sir
Henry, a tall, good-looking, sententious, portly man,
happening to embody his preconception of the noblé
owner of The Hyde, he set down as the country-baronet
the stunted peer, who, in spite of his efforts to appear
with a degree of dignity fitting the occasion, had con-
tracted, from his habitual dissatisfaction at the things
of this world, so sour a countenance, that he looked only
a little more mean and sullen than usual. ·
It was to the former, therefore, as the more promising
interlocutor, that the Colonel began instantly to unfold
the excitement of his mind, under the influence of the
news brought by the Overland Mail; and he talked, of
course, with all the prejudice and exaggeration of a man
of moderate judgment, who had been contemplating,
through life, a single side of a single question, unmodified
by the qualifying influences of society.
Overflowing with the righteous indignation enkindled
by a fiery leading article commenting on the Indian
news brought by the express, over which he had scarcely
found time to glance, his ardent feelings relieved them-
selves in a philippic against the Governor-General, for
his sanction of certain local abuses, concerning which no
mortal present was more interested than if they had
occurred among the natives of Nootka Sound. Amazed
by this sudden explosion of politics and petulance, the
party listened in silent and contemptuous wonder, as
they would have done to the rantings of a provincial Sir
Giles Overreach.
""His lordship ought to be instantly recalled, im-
peached, condemned. His lordship ought to be hanged,
drawn, and quartered!" was the unmeaning denunciation
of the mildest man on earth, under the contagion of
newspaper virulence; and as it happened that the sole
interest experienced by the Vernon family in the affairs
of the East consisted in cousinship to the offending
Governor-General, a frown contracted the brows of the
elder, and a smile the lips of the younger members of the

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
astonished family, while listening to the diatribes of the
Colonel.
At that moment (the fair Lucinda and Barlow of
Alderham having made their appearance) dinner was
luckily announced; when, alas ! the previous ceremonial,
decreed with more than a Lord Chamberlain's exactness
of etiquette, by Lady Vernon, in honour of Lord Dart-
ford's expected presence, was afflictingly superseded by
the exit of Lady Middlebury on the arm of her lord, and
her own on that of her brother-in-law.
Darby and Joan-fashion, I protest!” was Colonel
Hamilton's secret comment on the order of the procession.
“ And so the folks here go in to dinner in couples, like
Mr. and Mrs. Hem, Shem, and Japhet, in the children's
toy of Noah's Ark!— Well, among such high-flying
people, hang me but 'tis a better feeling than I should
have expected."
While musing, however, on this singularly conjugal
arrangement, he forgot to offer his arm to Miss Vernon,
who, gladly accepting that of Walter Hamlyn, waited
politely for her cousins to pass before her. In this
dilemma, the two poor shy Middlebury girls glanced at
each other awkwardly for mutual instructions; and,
having suddenly agreed to edge their way onwards
together like decanters in a coaster, the gallant old
gentleman, roused from his reverie, pushed forward to
offered an arm to each, with many jocular
expressions of regret that he could not cut himself in
two for their sakes; and, on reaching the dining-room
door, which, like those of most ancient houses, was ill
adapted for the admission of three abreast, produced new
confusion and delay by his boyish hilarity with the young
ladies.
Walter Hamlyn, who was following close behind, with
the supercilious Lucinda on bis arm, of whose persiflage
he stood more in awe than became his inches and mus.
tachios, had scarcely patience with the ill-timed pleasan-
tries of the veteran, to whom he was reluctantly officiating
as bear-leader; more especially as, on reaching the
brilliantly-lighted table so calculated to impose decorum
on its guests, the Colonel's jokes were renewed in taking
the rescue,

his seat, and unfolding his napkin between the two stiff,
frightened girls; whom the good old man unconsciously
addressed in something of the fatherly tone he was in the
habit of assuming towards his favourite Lydia at Dean
Park.
The sole consolation of Walter, in this predicament,
arose from the absence of the hyper-fastidious and super-
impertinent young gentleman of the house; but, as an
unexplained chair still stood vacant opposite, he in--
dulged in justly-founded apprehensions that the plea--
sure of Alberic's company was an evil still impending
over them.-His doubts on this point were speedily
resolved.
“I have not seen Alberic,” observed Sir Henry
Middlebury to his hostess, “ since his return from the
Continent."
“He will probably be here in time for the second
course,” observed Lady Vernon, in a tone of injured
dignity. “We never wait for my son. Alberic is
systematically unpunctual. Alberic is too late for
everything
“Then I must say that is a fault which, for, his own
sake, I should be loth to pass over in a son of mine ?”
exclaimed Colonel Hamilton, not understanding that,
being under the ban of the empire, he had no voice in
the diet. “I've never known an unpunctual man come
to good in public life. And, vice versa, look at the
punctual ones,-look at Nelson and Wellington !”–
As if in answer to the cue, Alberic Vernon, at that
moment sauntering in, honoured his friends and relatives,
as he took the vacant chair, with a nod of recognition,
and Colonel Hamilton, with a blank stare of amazement;
which, when the courteous old man replied by an instinc-
tive bow, assumed the form of one of John Kemble's salu-
tations.
“ Where is Dartford? I thought we were to have
Dartford ?” said he, addressing his sister across Walter

and explanations, abruptly silenced her son with “He
was suddenly called away into Shropshire by the illness
of his mother."

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
The question and answer, neither of which was over.
heard by Colonel Hamilton, (just then amused and
bewildered by the multiplicity of fish-sauces pressed
upon his choice by the maître d'hôtel,) and which,
even had they reached his ear, would have conveyed
nothing but regret that a youngster he so much liked
as the Marquis might have accompanied him to The
Hyde but for his family affliction,-contained a world
of enlightenment for Walter Hamlyn. All that had
been inexplicable in the invitation of Lady Vernon
was now accounted for; and the pang inflicted on his
self-love was only exceeded by his uneasiness at finding
himself an appendage to so unwelcome a guest as Colonel
Hamilton.
Instead of redoubling his endeavours to make himself
acceptable to his fair neighbour, Walter could not
divert his attention from the old gentleman opposite.
Every syllable uttered, every gesture hazarded by
the Colonel, became a source of consternation. Before
a sentence had half escaped his lips, Walter began to
deprecate its purport. He experienced, in short, all the
trepidation endured by the proprietor of a dog, which
has accidentally made its way into a lady's drawing-room.
The candid nature of the old Colonel secured him, how-
ever, from all participation in these perplexities. His
sociability of spirit was expanding. In that well-
warmed, well-lighted room, with a capital 'dinner before
him, a glass of generous wine in his hand, and, on either
side, a pleasing, modest-looking girl, he found himself
perfectly happy; talked unreservedly, laughed cordially,
and, after bantering Barlow of Alderham (who officiated
as substitute for his patron in muttering the benedicite
and carving the haunch of South Down) on divers petty
points of county jurisdiction, ended by infringing another
etiquette of The Hyde, by inviting his hostess (and by the
name of “my lady!") to take a glass of sherry.
Of all these enormities, Lord Vernon remained a mute
spectator; resigning himself to his injuries as if far too
well-accustomed to the evil entreatment of Providence, to
resent being sprighted by a presuming guest. His sullen
face was compressed almost to sternness by his resolve

not to be betrayed into open reprehension of Colonel
Hamilton's vulgar familiarity.
To Walter Hamlyn's susceptible vanity, however,
the conduct. of Alberic Vernon was still more morti-
fying. Assuming towards the stranger an air of ironical
deference, he affected to regard him with the indulg-
ence due to the newly-caught native of some uncivilized
quarter of the globe; whose peculiarities afford matter
for philosophical speculation to the world of broad-
cloth and brocade. Walter Hamlyn almost writhed
under the supercilious expression of Mr. Vernon's coun-
tenance, while affecting to draw out the eccentricities of
their semi-savage guest.
It was torture to the banker's son every time the poor
Colonel apostrophized his stately hostess or her sister as
“ my lady;" por could he forgive his mother for having
omitted to school her unsophisticated friend, on this and
other futile points of conventional usage.
As the champagne and burgundy went round, the
joviality of the sociable old man warmed into chirup-
ping garrulity. He talked only as he had talked to
the Rotherwoods,- only as he had talked when com-
manding the admiring attention of young Dartford; little
suspecting how thoroughly his anecdotes were out of
place. Struck by the beauty of Lucinda Vernon, who
was seated opposite, and attributing to one so young and
fair the inward and spiritual grace appropriate to inno-
cence, youth, and beauty, he was overjoyed at the good-
fortune of his friend Walter in having so charming a
neighbour.
"Well, Master Watty,” said he, across the table, after
inviting him to join him in a glass of Hock—“do you
still repent your frosty drive? I suspect, my boy, you
know too well what's what, to quarrel with such a dinner,
enjoyed by the side of such a young lady!"
The higher Colonel Hamilton's spirits, the more offen-
sive became his company to those who, even had they
found his manners more consonant with their own,-
“like table-land, high and flat,” would have been equally
disinclined to see him seated at their board.
In the course of the evening, matters grew worse and
I

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
worse.
The Vernons remained cold and silent; and
the Middleburys, who, had Colonel Hamilton been a new
settler in their own neighbourhood, would have welcomed
him as a pleasant chatty old gentleman, considered it a
token of respect to the displeasures of their noble
relatives, to treat him with distant civility.
Alberic, who affected the fashionable insouciance of a
miss-hater, afraid of compromising himself by exchang-
ing a syllable with his cousins, devoted himself to the
study of the new Annuals, (in which his own Honourable-
ship figured as the contributor of some amusingly muzzy
“Musings in the Coliseum ;")—while Captain Hamlyn
and Lucinda, having their London friends to cry down,
talked in whispers, and exclusively to each other.
Thus thrown out of the circle, the Colonel, ac-
commodating himself by a happy knack to whatever
circumstances he was placed in, and to extract “sermons
from stones and good from everything,” took refuge in a
grave discussion between Henry Middlebury and Mr.
Barlow on the Briarean question of pauper legislation;
which, in the true country-gentleman spirit of worrying
an argument as dogs worry a bone, they were fighting
over, inch by inch, and act of parliament by act of
parliament.
The Benthamisms of Hamilton, fresh with the raw
philanthropy of a new and not very enlightened settler
in England, were expressed with a degree of warmth
startling to his sober hearers. Never before had Mr.
Barlow heard the well-bred insipidity of that state-apart-
ment insulted by the emission of sentiments and prin-
ciples so nearly approaching to Radicalism. With all due
respect for the short-sighted benevolence of the old Indian,
he considered his manifesto out of place.
“I tell ye what!” cried Colonel Hamilton,--suddenly
appealing to Lord Vernon,—the real Lord Vernon,-
whose identity he had discovered through the “my lord-
ing” of the servants, and who now sat exchanging short
cold sentences, as round and smooth as marbles, with
Lady Middlebury, as though the Political Economy tear-
ing to rags within their hearing were frivolous, vexatious,
and beneath his notice,"it may sound very wise and

statesmanlike to say that such and such principles are
inapplicable to a particlar county, or particlar crisis.
But, by George! human natur' is human natur' all over
the world; ay, my lord,--and from king Pharoah's time
to our own! One's fellow-creatures are one's fellow-
creatures, -one's brethren,-whether they live in Lanca-
shire or Cornwall ;-and to my thinking, such measures
as were shown up t'other day at the Union at Braxham,
and the county member who defended the county magis-
trates when the question was mooted in parliament, will
have something to answer for afore God!"
A dead silence followed this awful denunciation; from
which Sir Henry Middlebury justly concluded that Bar-
low of Alderham was one of the magistrates in question,
-Alberic Vernon the offending county member; and
being by no means anxious to figure as second in a duel
to either of the parties, he hastened to hint, with
precipitate incoherence, that “by the time Colonel
Hamilton had been a few years longer in England, ho
might probably alter his views on many points con-
nected with the giant-striding claims of the Poor!”
“I hope not, I humbly hope not!"--was Colonel
Hamilton's eager rejoinder. But Sir Henry heard him
not. He was now exemplifying in a double sense his
love of harmony by inquiring of Miss Vernon whether
she and his daughters would not "favour them with a
little music;"—the country Baronet avowing himself so
great a rustic as to treat of “ a little music"
favour!"
Unaware that a request of this kind, in mixed society,
implies a desire to put a stop to rational conversation,
Colonel Hamilton was not to be silenced. Resuming
his appeal to Lord Vernon, after toddling across the
room to throw himself beside his lordship on the sofa,
“I've often thought, since I came into this neighbour-
hood,” said he, in a more confidential tone,
and I, my lord, and a few more of the influential landed
proprietors, were to—"
"I was not aware, sir,” gravely interrupted Lord
Vernon, drawing away the knee on which his strange
neighbour had, in the exuberance of his philanthropic
as

proprietor of the county of Warwick."
“Pho, pho, pho!-You know what I mean. I've got to
live, and die, and spend fifteen thousand a year among
ye; and if that isn't an equivalent to landed proprietor-
ship, I don't know what is! I've thought many a time,
my lord, -as I was saying just now,—that if we were all
to lay our heads together, some plan might certainly be
hit upon for—"
“Do me the favour to excuse me, sir!". -said Lord
Vernon, coldly, rising from his seat.
fortunate as to hear these questions too often debated
in my place in parliament, and among the responsible
representatives of the throne, to have much appetite for
bringing them on the tapis of my own drawing-room.
Points on which the collective wisdom of the realm is
perpetually engaged, are scarcely likely to derive much
elucidation from our puny attempts at development. If
you are fond of parochial legislation, I beg to refer you
for my share of the argument,--as I universally do your
friend Mr. Hamlyn,-to the abler hands of my agent,
Mr. Barlow of Alderham. Mr. Barlow, sir, will, I am
sure, be happy to meet you in any discussion you wish
to promote. Lady Vernon! we are waiting your com-
mands for whist. Alberic! may I ask the favour of you
to ring for cards ?”
Whist levels all distinctions, and silences all argumen-
tation. Under its influence, the dull, constrained evening
at length concluded; and but that, on stepping out of
the carriage, Colonel Hamilton had given orders that his
own might be sent for him at eleven the following day,
gladly would he have returned to sleep at Dean Park.
Though still unsuspicious that he was an uninvited
guest, he could not stand the repellent reserve of the
Vernons. It was the first specimen of fashionable
superciliousness he had ever met with ; and the hollow-
ness of such a reception wounded him like a poisoned
krees.
I could almost fancy the old Don intended to be
uncivil to-night!" mused the Colonel, in silence, while
his faithful Johnston was assisting him to undress.


## p. 117 (#129) ############################################

OR, COURT AND CITY.
117
" Yet how could that be?—Why invite me to his house ?-
Why make me free of his park, on my first arrival? Why
send his wife to leave a card upon me, if he intended to
be uppish ?—No, no,—'tis the way of these fine folks -
They're born so,--they're nat'rally ungracious. By
George! Mrs. Hamlyn was right.—These Vernons are
as little suited to me as I to them."
In spite of all his distaste, however, for the hauteur of
the house, Colonel Hamilton was not blind to its merits.
He was favourably impressed by the peculiar air 'of dis-
tinction of the ladies of the family, and the admirable
organization of the household. It had not before
occurred to him as possible, that anything so perfect in
its details as that dinner could be produced, served, rand
enjoyed, with such mechanical nonchalance. The step
or voice of a menial was unheard in the establishment;
the servants appeared to be no more than ingenious
machines. Yet even his unspoken wishes had been divined
and accomplished. He would have been sorry to mortify
Johnston by avowing how thoroughly he recognised the
merit of those well-powdered magicians.
“'Tis vexatious enough these folks should turn out so
deuced disagreeable!" was his concluding reflection, as he
closed his eyes for the night. “It would have afforded a
pleasant change for us all, to be on friendly terms with
the family at The Hyde.”
The morrow's sun rose glitteringly over fresh-fallen
snow, as bright and cheerful as on a day in June', and
it was, consequently, difficult for a man of good disposi-
tion, like Colonel Hamilton, to rise from a good bed to
a good breakfast after a good night's rest, in an ill-
humour with himself or his neighbours. Colonel Hamil-
ton was not in the habit of living on bad terms with
Providence. While viewing the varied afflictions of the
human kind, he had not courage to sulk, 'like Lord
Vernon, with his prosperous fortunes; and proceeded,
with a heart over-brimming with milk and honey, to the
breakfast-room, where the ungenial crew were gradually
re-assembling:
“This is all mons’ous pleasant!” said he, after going
through the customary morning salutations, and slapping

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Walter Hamlyn on the back, while inquiring whether no
pretty face had embellished his dreams.
“One could almost fancy oneself in summer, or in Indy,"
he continued, pointing with his breakfast-fork to a beau-
tiful conservatory opening from the room, and bright
with Persian lilacs, camellias, and hyacinths of every dye.
“The march of science has unquestionably enabled us
to defy the influence of the seasons,” replied the senten-
tious Sir Henry Middlebury, perceiving that no one was
at the trouble of answering an observation addressed to
all. “The Epicureans of the ancient world would, in all
probability, be somewhat startled, could they arise from
their tombs and survey the luxurious improvement of
our social habits. As regards, however, the introduction
of conservatories among the adjuncts of domestic archi-
tecture, I am inclined to believe the gaseous emanations
of the majority of the floral tribes decidedly inimical to
the salubrity of the atmosphere."
Colonel Hamilton, who seldom bothered his brain with
polysyllables, and knew no more of gaseous emanations"
than a New Zealander, pursued his own view of the
question; addressing his observations, however, to the
real Simon Pure, to whom he was indebted for the cup
of
smoking coffee before him.
“I often used to think, my lord," said he, “when I
came driving and strolling about your place, whilst you
were away at t'other castle in the North, that this must
make a mighty grim, damp sort of winter residence.
But I protest you've not only banished the blue devils,
but made it every bit as liveable a place as Bur-
lington Manor or Dean Park !—It must have cost a mint
of money to modernize it as you've done, inside, without
altering the cut of its countenance. But the attempt
has answered, -by George !—it has answered. I was
saying last night to Mr. Thingumee, your agent, that, if
the place had been on hire, I'd almost as lief have taken
it as Burlington Manor.--I would, upon my life and
soul!"
Walter Hamlyn glanced instinctively at the silver
coffee-pot, standing at Lord Vernon's elbow, as if half
expecting to see it hurled at the head of the offender.

But his lordship contented himself with replying, with a
deadly smile and livid complexion, “Sir, you do me in-
finitely too much honour.”
“Not a bit, not a bit,”—cried the Colonel,-full of
good faith and feeling. “You may believe every syllable
that falls from my lips. I'm a rough diamond, I know;
but as real as unpolished."
Though he had almost determined, on leaving his
room that morning, not to exchange another syllable,
while they remained at The Hyde, with his unpopular
companion, Walter now judged it prudent to interfere.
“I have charming news for your sledging project,
Colonel Hamilton,” said he. “ Lord Vernon's venerable
head-keeper has just announced that the frost has set
in for a fortnight; and old Tom Giles is an oracle !--
A sad prospect for us!" continued he, addressing young
Vernon, who had just sauntered into the room, and was
asking for rizzered haddock.
“ No chance of a run,
I
fear, for some time to come!”
“By George! if I'd known of this, last night,” cried
the Colonel, I'd have sent word to Burlington, by your
people, Watty, to bring round the sledge here this
morning, instead of the carriage."
“ You_have mounted a sledge, then ?” inquired
Alberic Vernon, almost with interest. “Vastly spirited,
certainly, considering there are not half-a-dozen days in
an English winter to render it available! Always too
much frost for hunting,—seldom enough for skating,
“ de trop ou de trop peu, partoût dans ce monde !"
“I mounted a sledge only because I've a pretty little
friend who had set her heart upon one,” rejoined Colonel
Hamilton, wondering why the avowal should produce so
singular a smile on the lips of Alberic Vernon.
"I trust your pretty little friend will prove properly
grateful,” said he, with a plausible face. “ You seem
bent, my dear sir, on enlightening the darkness of our
obtuse county. No end to the curious spectacles with
which you have already favoured the neighbourhood!"
“Ah! you mean my hookahbadar and the Thibet
goats ?” replied the Colonel.
“Not exactly," was Alberic Vernon's reply; when

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Sir Henry Middlebury, perceiving (though by no means
a miracle of discernment), from the confusion of Captain
Hamlyn's countenance, that his nephew was perpetrating
impertinences, with a becoming deference to Colonel
Hamilton's age, calling, and income, brought up his
heavy forces to the assistance of the weaker party. The
Baronet's minute and prolix inquiries concerning the
construction of the sledge, its cost, and principles of
draught, allowed time to Alberic to recover his sense of
decency. On this occasion, Sir Henry's powers of pro-
sing proved as valuable as those of a pompous Mr.
Speaker in the House of Commons; who, in the midst
of an uproarious debate, rises to expound some point
of law, and afford breathing time to the infuriated belli-
gerents.
Already it had glanced into Alberic Vernon's mind,
that though Colonel Hamilton did not belong to White's,
was not in parliament, and neither employed a quotable
tailor, nor understood a syllable of French, it was un-
becoming his chivalry to insult a grayheaded man under
his father's roof; and, with his usual glibness of speech,
he accordingly began to descant upon sledges in general,
torch-races in Germany,--sleighing parties in America-
and, the brilliant traineaux of Moscow and the Bois
de Boulogne.
..:“We had some charming sledge-races at Ratisbon,
last winter," said he, addressing Lady Middlebury, lest
he should be suspected of civility to her daughter. “I
remember, one night, that mad - Hungarian, Prince
Keglovies, in attempting to cross the Danubé at full
gallop, turned over the traineau of one of the young
Princes of Saxony, and broke his arm.".
“For mischief-sake ?" abruptly inquired Colonel
Hamilton.
"For a wager. · I made my whole journey through
Styria, last Christmas, in a sledge; and flatter myself I
drive one like a Laplander. But the horses are too
heavy in this country for anything of the kind,-a great
deal too heavy.'
“By George! I wish you'd try mine!" cried Colonel
Hamilton, cordially; wholly unaware of the young

وز
gentleman's previous impertinence. “ There's almost
time, now, to send over for it, if one of your lazy stable
fellows could be spared."
Mr. Vernon hesitated;—for the proposition really took
his fancy. But he was ashamed to accept a civility from
the man they had been confederating together to keep at
arm's length.
“If you choose to make the experiment this morning,
continued the Colonel, ever intent upon promoting
the pleasures of other people, "you must compromise
with driving over to Dean to give Miss Hamlyn
a turn; for I promised her she should have the first
day's enjoyment of the Royal Lydia, which was built
solely to please her. Poor dear, I wouldn't have her
disappointed for a Jew's eye! However, I suppose a
pretty girl's company will be no obstacle to the pleasure
of the drive.”
The whole party looked aghast;—Alberic, at so auda-
cious an attack upon his hand and heart; Lady Middle-
bury and her daughters, at the immorality of such a
project as a téte-à-tête between a young gentleman and
young lady.
"My sister will easily bear the privation for a single
day," cried Walter Hamlyn, in utter confusion. “Mr.
Vernon has far too many agreeable companions at his
disposal, my dear Colonel, to render it necessary to seek
one so far from home.”
“But I won't hear of Lydia's being put off!" cried the
Colonel, stoutly. "I settled it t'other day with the
young Marquis, that he was to be the first to drive her ;
and a sad vexation 'twas to him, poor fellow, to be forced
to go off at a moment's warning, before the sledge was
off the stocks. The very last thing he said to me, as he
stepped into his char'ot, was a wish the snow might last
long enough to enable me to drive it over to Dartford
Hall. “But even then, my dear lord,' said I, nudging
his elbow, you won't have Miss Lydia along with it;
on which (between friends) he turned as red as scarlet.
He didn't suspect, poor lad, that any one had been
noticing how plaguy sweet he was upon the young lady
all the time he was staying at Dean Park. But he's a

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
fine fellow, any way, that Lord Dartford, a fine, hearty,
manly, unaffected fellow; and, by George, I wish there
were more like him in the world!"
This rambling speech, which seemed almost intended to
convey reproach to the two young men present, was
followed by a profound silence. Lady Vernon and her
daughter seemed petrified. Regarding the Marquis of
Dartford as almost a portion of their goods and chattels,
they considered the mere junction of his name with that
of the banker's daughter a positive profanation. Still,
the man on so familiar a footing with the Marquis was
not altogether to be coughed down.
Already Sir Henry Middlebury was coming to their
aid, in his usual laudable spirit of prosy investigation;
begging to know in what particular consisted the supe-
riority of Lord Dartford, whether he had taken his seat in
parliament, and were likely to distinguish himself in the
House ?
Before the question had been jealously answered by
Alberic, and scoutingly by Captain Hamlyn, as incon-
sistent with the well-known habits of their friend, the
breakfast party broke up; the carriage being announced
for the departure of the visitors for Dean Park.
By a strange but not unnatural revulsion of feeling, no
sooner did Lord Vernon behold Colonel Hamilton in the
act of taking leave, previous to quitting his house for
ever, than the instincts of English nature were roused
for'a moment in his stubborn heart; suggesting a regret
that he had been tempted into ungraciousness towards any
guest under his roof. Conscious that the old soldier
was guiltless of intentional intrusion on his hospitality,
Lord Vernon felt that, so long as the stranger remained
within his gates, he was entitled to courtesy and protec-
tion. As regarded the question of their future acquaint-
anceship-
There might have come a time for that hereafter,
These scruples of conscience were only increased by
the openness of heart and hand with which Colonel
Hamilton, unsuspicious as guiltless of offence, expressed
at parting his cordial hopes to Lady Vernon and her

123
daughter that they would shortly visit him at Burlington
Manor, bringing with them the Middlebury family, Sir
Henry having expressed his usual painstaking curiosity
concerning the complexion of raw betel-nuts, and the
fleece and feeding of Thibet goats.
At that moment, Lord Vernon felt almost vexed at
the repellent coldness with which his lady received these
neighbourly demonstrations. Like Alexander the Great,
he began to reckon it among the many miseries of his
destiny, that his orders were too punctiliously obeyed.
Hey day! what an't we to travel home together,
then ?" cried the Colonel, addressing Walter, as they
traversed the hall escorted by Sir Henry and Alberic,
who were projecting a walk to look after snipes in the
neighbourhood of Braxham Mere,-on perceiving that
his own carriage and Walter's back were in attendance.
“You mentioned, sir, that you were not returning to
Dean, but to Burlington; and, as I have business at Oving-
ton on my way home,” Captain Hamlyn was beginning-
" Ay, ay, ay! I see how 'tis, I see how 'tis !” good-
humouredly interrupted the Colonel. “You threw over
the old man, because you'd a mind to give yourself a
chance of being invited to stop another day in a house
containing three pretty girls. At your age, my boy, I
should ha' done just the same! But come ! Watty, drive
back with me; and if you'll stay and dine, Goody Johnston
shall toss you up one of those famous dry curries I was
talking about yesterday at dinner, of which not a soul in
England knows the secret but herself. I promise you
that one of Mrs. Johnston's prawn-curries, washed down
by a glass of my old Madeira, is a thing not to be sneezed
at, even by a fine gentleman of the Blues. By George!
it whets an appetite that would carry you through three
courses and a half of French kickshaws."
Afraid of hazarding a glance towards Alberic Vernon's
impertinent face, Walter Hamlyn politely excused him-
self. While the Colonel was assisted into his well-
appointed carriage, he mounted and rode hastily from
the door; secretly blessing his stars that a visit was at
an end, to which, for years past, he had been looking
forward as an almost unattainable pleasure.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
CHAPTER VIII.
“The best composition and temperature (for worldly success) is to have openness
in fame and opinion, secrecy in habit, dissimulation in seasonable use, and a power
to feign if there be no remedy."-Bacon.
6 his
THOUGH the morning was one of the brightest of winter
mornings, and his hack one of the best reputed in the
county, Captain Hamlyn's ride homewards was far from
a pleasant one. For whatever he might have been in-
tended by nature, Walter was, by the influence of educa-
tion, more worldly and artificial than is generally supposed
compatible with the warm impulses of four-and-twenty.
Not “ Nature,” but Art was
goddess !—"
Trained by his father in abject deference to the
opinion of the world, the verdict of the coteries (the
"world" with which he was chiefly acquainted) compré-
hended his Alpha and Omega. His likings and dislikings
had long been regulated by fashionable favour; and a
suspicion was just arising in his mind that a sentiment
stronger still was about to originate under a similar
influence.
From the moment of his introduction to Lucinda
Vernon, at a royal ball, where he had been accounted
the handsomest man, and she the best valseuse in the
room, he had regarded her with strong admiration ; ad-
miration not a little enhanced by the consecration of the
name of Vernon to his early reverence, by the worship
of Dean Park. In the days of the old Lord Vernon, the
families had lived on terms of intimacy, which did not
prevent their mutual visitations from being gaudy days
and domestic epochs in the archives of the Hamlyn
tribe.
To such a slave to appearances as Walter, the grace
and elegance of Miss Vernon were, in fact, a sufficient
merit; and now that he had beheld her deriving new
charms from the dignities of her father's house, yet
accepting his attentions far more propitiously than she

125
had ever done in town, his prepossession in her favour
was complete. Young, pretty, animated, there was
something in Lucinda's smile, when she did choose to
smile, peculiarly ingratiating; and as she had chosen to
dispense her smiles to the intimate friend of the fortunate
man whose marchioness she was bent on becoming, the
deluded guest had every reason to suppose himself an
object of interest in her fastidious eye.
In London, Walter was a general favourite. Hamlyn
of the Blues had conquests to boast of, far more gratify-
ing to dandy vanity than the preference of Lord Vernon's
daughter; and it was, therefore, no exorbitant stretch of
self-love to infer that, had other contingencies prospered
the pretension, his homage might not have proved un-
acceptable to the daughter of his noble neighbour.
Lucinda was precisely the worldly wife for so worldly
a husband ;-a man who took as much delight in ap-
pearances as others in reality. Lucinda sympathized in
all his pretentious finery. Lucinda, like himself, had
not an aim beyond the narrow horizon of fashionable life.
With such a bride, he felt that he should be indescribably
happy; no longer the humble Hamlyn of Dean Park, but
son-in-law to the Right Hon. John Lord Vernon, and
appurtenant to the noble family at The Hyde; no longer
fated to figure in day-books and ledgers, but included in
the flattering page of Burke, Lodge, and Debrett!
But, above all, to be beloved by that thrice-refined
being to whom the vulgar earth seemed scarcely good
enough to tread, who cultivated impertinence as an
accomplishment, and pride as a virtue! It was really too
flattering an unction to be laid to any mortal soul, and
Walter, as he proceeded to recall, smile by smile, and
repartee by repartee, their delightful conversation of the
preceding evening, suddenly uttered so deep a sigh as
sent his warm breath into the frosty atmosphere like the
burst of extra steam from a tender.
For, alas! it occurred at the same moment, that, though
any decided avowal of preference on the part of Miss
Vernon might, in the early days of their London acquaint-
tance, have mollified her father in favour of a gentlemanly
young man, the heir to an unencumbered estate of six

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
thousand a-year, all was now frustrated by the degrading
light in which he had made his débút at The Hyde, as
esquire to a foolish Knight; henceforward to be inextri-
cably connected in the minds of the family with the old
Ostrogoth who had proposed to hang, for incompetency,
their Right Honourable cousin, the Earl of Clanswaney;
and addressed Lady Vernon as “my lady," after the
fashion of her footmen.
"I was certain the intimacy of that blundering old
blockhead boded us no good,” murmured Walter, in the
bitterness of his heart. 6 How shall I ever manage to
make my father understand the irreparable injury he may
do us by entailing such a nuisance on the family. Use-
less to appeal to my mother, I fear,-utterly useless :
the seclusion of her life renders her comparatively indif-
ferent to the verdict of society. Besides, the old gentle-
man's foolish partiality for my sister has enlisted her as
his warmest partisan. But the governor, thank Heaven,
is a man of the world; and on hearing how Hamilton has
been committing himself and us, may grow less fond of
his company. No time to be lost in broaching the sub-
ject. After to-morrow,-my father and mother start for
Rotherwood Castle, and thence for town; where, once
settled to business, it is impossible to abstract the
governor's attention a moment from his consols and
exchequer-bills. But we shall be alone to-day, and after
dinner, over our wine, I will not lose the opportunity of
relating Hamilton's preposterous allusions to Dartford
and Lydia, which, in the presence of Lady Vernon, posi-
tively made
my
blood run cold !"
On arriving at home, however, Walter saw that his
father was in no mood for trifling expostulations. Rarely,
save in the intimate privacy of wedded life, never, with
his favourite son, did Richard Hamlyn give way to irrita-
tion of temper; but by the saddened looks of his mother,
Walter perceived, the moment he entered the house,
that something was amiss. He could almost have fancied,
indeed, that her eyelids were swollen with weeping: a
painful suspicion, for he loved his mother, if not as she
deserved, as much as was compatible with the shallow
selfishness of his heart. He would have prized her more

highly had she been the offspring of nobility, than as the
daughter of a family of hereditary merchants, who en-
tailed upon him the opprobrium of having his second
name (for he was "Walter Harrington Hamlyn”) en-
graved upon brewers' drays and warehousemen's wagons.
But, as is usually the case, the parent who had never
flattered his foibles was the one nearest to his heart.
“What is the matter to-day with my mother ?” he
inquired anxiously of Lydia, when Mrs. Hamlyn suddenly
left the room in which he had found them sitting together,
engaged at work.
“Nothing that I am aware of," replied his sister, to
whom it was no unusual occurrence to see her mother
out of spirits.
“She was cheerful enough when we drove off yester-
day to dinner,” persisted Walter; "and now she will
scarcely utter a word.”
“Mamma had no opportunity to say much while you
were giving us your lively account of the party at The
Hyde," observed Miss Hamlyn. “But it does not strike
me that she is more silent than usual. The house appears
duller, of course, than when filled with
company
at
youz
first arrival. You miss Lord Dartford, -you miss Colonel
Hamilton."
“ Miss Colonel Hamilton ?" exclaimed Walter, shrug-
ging his shoulders, a suspicion glancing into his mind
that, according to the old man's surmises, the departure
of the Marquis might at least be a source of regret to
his sister. “ No, I miss nobody. I miss only my
mother's usual smile, which is certainly the sweetest in
the world. Either I have offended her, or something is
going wrong in the family."
“ What can be going wrong?” cried Lydia. “My
dear Walter, the change is in yourself, not in mamma.
By the way, now I think of it, she may be a little out of
spirits; for she was telling me, as you came in, that we
should have to go to Rotherwood Castle without my
father, who is obliged to return to London to-morrow.
To-morrow? How provoking! On that eternal plea
of business, I suppose.—I wish the word City were
effaced from the language !"

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
“Might not the name of Hamlyn chance to disappear
in 'its company ?” replied Lydia, who, under the encou-
ragement of Colonel Hamilton, had of late sometimes
hazarded a retort
upon
her brother.
“Nonsense! Do you suppose that Mr. Hamlyn, of
Dean Park, Mr. Hamlyn, the member for Barthorpe,
has no existence out of Lombard Street ?” inquired
Walter, taking up his usual station in the rocking-chair,
as if for the composure of his irritation. “I wish to
Heaven,” he continued, pursuing his train of sinister
reflections, " that I had made up my mind to proceed at
once to Melton, with Dartford, instead of deranging my
plans with Warwickshire and Ormeau! I see how it
will happen. Here shall I be, in case the frost sets in,
weather-logged at Dean, with that insufferable old man
constantly buzzing about us, like a huge insect; and pro-
fiting by my father's absence to bore us eternally with
his company! Yesterday, on our way to The Hyde, he
had literally the coolness to invite me to dine and sleep
at Burlington, to meet-guess whom."
"The Markhams, perhaps ?"
“A thousand times worse! Tom Gratwycke, a vulgar,
silly, lanky boy, with whom my tiger would scarcely
associate !"
It was easy to excuse yourself!”
"Not so easy as you may fancy. A man so provok-
ingly friendly and hospitable as this worthy Colonel of
jours, is as hard to throw over as the Tower of Pisa. If the
weather were not so detestable, I would start for Melton
when you are off to Rotherwood, sooner than remain here."
Why not return to town with my father ?"
“When I have just got two months' leave ? Absurd !
I had so thoroughly counted on a fortnight here and a
month at Melton, with Dartford !"
“ It is really most inconsiderate of Lady Dartford to
fall ill during the hunting season !" cried Lydia, laughing.
But, perhaps, when it becomes generally known how
much you are bored here, and what an infliction you
find
Colonel Hamilton, Providence may send us a thaw, or
better health to the Marchioness."
Walter surveyed the saucy girl with some surprise.

But the result of his examination was favourable to
Lydia. Though sharing his father's indignation that a
child of seventeen should presume to have an opinion of
her own, he was startled by the discovery that, while his
attention was absorbed by his London pleasures, his
sister had been expanding in the school-room into a
lovely and intelligent girl, to a degree that fully accounted
for the imputed admiration of his friend the Marquis.
“ Mean time," said he, resuming the train of his reflec-
tions, “be assured that I shall not disgrace myself by
again appearing before the Vernons in company with
Colonel Hamilton; and so I mean to announce this
very
day to my father.'
The torporific influence of a family dinner enjoyed
after the taciturn fashion of Dean Park produced, how-
ever, some modification in Walter's heroic intentions.
On the present occasion, Mr. Hamlyn not only abstained
from the mention of proper names, but remained alto-
gether silent, so long as Ramsay and the footmen were
in attendance. During dessert, he did not exceed mono-
syllables; and by the time the ladies withdrew, Walter's
confidence in himself and in his influence over his father,
was somewhat shaken. Had he possessed a single sin
unwhipped of justice, in the form of a play-debt or dis-
graceful affair of gallantry, he would have trembled at
the idea of being left alone with “ the Governor!”
Scarcely, however, had Mrs. Hamlyn quitted the room,
when the spirits of her husband appeared suddenly to
revive. Drawing his chair nearer the fire, he rang
fresh bottle of claret, specifying to Ramsay a particular
binn;
the favourite Mouton which had been in requisi-
tion for the recent Rotherwood party.
“ After all,” thought Walter, as the discomfiture of my
father and mother arose probably from one of those con-
jugal misunderstandings common to the best-regulated
families. Most likely, they disagreed about my sister;
whom her mother brings as much too forward, as her
father wants to keep too much in the background. My
mind is relieved. I think I may venture to announce
my visit to Melton, and throw down the gauntlet to
Burlington Manor."

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Nevertheless, to his own surprise, Walter, who was
the only member of the family unrestrained by the
habitual gravity of his father, found it difficult to open
the conversation he meditated; not from finding him,
as he expected, out of sorts, but from the vein of unusual
loquacity in which Mr. Hamlyn saw fit to indulge.
No sooner did the favourite claret arrive, than he
expanded, with reckless fluency, on a thousand uncon-
sidered trifles, which, in his ordinary mood, he would have
scorned as unworthy of mention ;—such as the merits of
Lord Vernon's French cook, the fine proportions of Lord
Dartford's figure, and the bad taste of the Etruscar:
library at The Hyde. Gratwyckes, Barlows, Markhams,
---Ovington, Bråxham, Barthorpe, ---all and sundry-
everything and nothing, -elicited in succession some
flighty remark from the habitually taciturn banker. But
that Walter could have numbered the glasses swallowed
by his sober parent, he could almost have supposed
him under the influence of wine.
“As you say, old Middlebury is a mouthy, pompous,
empty fellow!" said he, cheerfully addressing his son.
I remember him at college,-a pains-taking ass, even
then,-wearing his soul out and other peoples' to ascer-
tain, chapter and verse, the cause and effect of things
that wiser people are content to take for granted. Another
glass of claret, Walter! This Mouton is not to be de-
spised. But Sir Henry is a man highly respected in
his county; always in the chair at public meetings,
and so forth. Lady Middlebury used to be a pretty
woman, far prettier than Lady Vernon. The late Lord
Vernon was often heard to say that his son had been
taken in by the wrong sister. The late Lord Vernon
had an aversion to the whole family. Your health,
Walter, - your friend Lord Dartford's health. What
sort of girl has the present Miss Vernon grown up ?
Better looking than her eight ugly aunts, I hope,-whom
old Gratwycke used to call the eight foolish virgins.
I have not seen Miss Vernon since she was a child.''
“She is considered one of the prettiest persons in
London," replied Walter, more warmly than was his
wont, so contagious is the influence of good wine and

good spirits. “Miss Vernon possesses an air of distinction
and high-breeding, in my opinion, far superior to beauty."
“ She will marry well, I dare say, though I doubt
whether her father will be inclined to come down with
the ready," said Hamlyn. “I think I heard Lord Crawley,
the other night, quizzing his nephew about the fair lady
of The Hyde ?"
“Dartford ?” exclaimed Walter Hamlyn, " Dartford ?
No, no, that would never do," added he, with the signifi-
cant smile that overspreads the face of a handsome man,
when naming a rival to whom he
supposes
himself pre-
ferred. “ Dartford is an excellent fellow; but (as you
must have perceived) fond only of horses, dogs, driving,
sporting, billiards—
“In short, not a ladies' man!” interrupted his father,
summing up.
“Whereas Miss Vernon is refinement and elegance
itself; the sort of girl whom, were it your wish I should
marry and our prospects in life were equal, I should
prefer above all others for a wife.”
Mr. Hamlyn, fancying, perhaps, that he had not dis-
tinctly understood the words uttered by his son, drew
his chair a little closer; and as he poured out another
bumper of claret, glanced interrogatively at his face.
" I said, sir, that were I at liberty to make a choice,
of all the girls of my acquaintance I would marry the
daughter of Lord Vernon."
Mr. Hamlyn replied by a sudden burst of laughter,
that sounded hysterical. He was a person who seldom
laughed. When he did, his mirth had almost the appear-
ance of a convulsion.
“You ?" cried he; "you marry the daughter of Lord
Vernon ?-You, Walter Hamlyn, unite yourself with a
penniless fine lady?-You, the son of Hamlyn of Lom-
bard Street,-of Hamlyn the banker? Think of the
tone in which that stiff-necked pharisee, Lord Vernon,
would pronounce those very words—the son of Hamlyn
the banker!'"
“I am not likely to afford him the opportunity of in-
sulting us, sir,” replied Walter, coolly. “So far from
deeming it possible I could be received at The Hyde as a

suitor, I never expect to enter the house again, even as
a guest. After the offensive conduct of your friend
Colonel Hamilton," he continued, nettled by the reite-
rated laughter of his father, I shall consider Lord
Vernon fully justified in cutting our acquaintance. It
required all my self-command and forbearance, sir, not
to tell the old fellow, when we left The Hyde this morn-
ing, how great a savage I consider him.”
The merriment of Mr. Hamlyn instantly ceased. A
moment before, he had been raising his glass to the light,
as if in admiration of the hue and clearness of his claret.
He now suddenly set down the glass.
“ Better cut your tongue out, Walter Hamlyn," was
his stern reply, " than let it convey offence to Colonel
Hamilton!”
The banker had the air of being as abruptly sobered,
as he had before been suddenly excited. Yet Captain
Hamlyn, on raising his eyes in amazement to his father's
face, fancied he could discern about the mouth spasmodic
twitches of suppressed passion.
“Be assured, sir,” he resumed, in a pacifying tone,
" that I did not hazard so much as an ungracious syllable
to the old gentleman. We parted the best friends in
the world. Be under no apprehensions."
Apprehensions !--What apprehensions, and appre-
hensions of what?" repeated Mr. Hamlyn, with kindling
eyes. “Of whom do you suppose I am afraid ?--All I
desire is, that a poor old man, who has not a relation in
the world, who has survived his kith and kin, his wife and
children, should derive in his declining years such comfort
as our society can afford him. A mere matter of Chris-
tian charity, Walter-a mere matter of Christian charity!
Hamilton is very fond of you; he admires you, he appre-
ciates you. You were his son's fag, I fancy, at Eton; and
your very name refreshes his heart with reminiscences
of his children.”
“ His name brings back to me reminiscences of the
blacking-brush, which Jack Hamilton used to fling every
morning at my head when his shoes were not ready!"-
cried Walter, hoping to divert the serious view his father
had for a moment seemed inclined to take of the case.

“ Robert Hamilton was nearer your age, I fancy ?” re-
sumed Mr. Hamlyn, with an air of abstraction.
“Robert I liked even less than his brother. Bob was
a peevish, sickly fellow."
“ His sickliness, my dear boy, (between ourselves,)
may prove the origin of singular good-fortune to your-
self," said Mr. Hamlyn.
“ To me?" reiterated Walter, with a smile.
“I have reason to know,” persisted his father, lowering
his voice to a still more confidential pitch, " that the
widow is coming to spend the spring at Burlington
Manor."
What widow ?" inquired Walter Hamlyn, beginning
to fear that what he had at first mistaken for intoxication
might be in truth mental disorder.
“Robert Hamilton's widow. That beautiful Ellen
Somerton, whom his father (at my instigation) did so
much to prevent his marrying, and who made him so good
a wife.
“Well, sir?" demanded Walter, still perplexed by his
father's incoherency of manner.
“I mean to say that a pretty wife and a good wife,
when converted into a widow, may make a good and
pretty wife again. Mrs. Robert Hamilton's health, Walter!
-Drink it, my boy, in a bumper!—Mrs. Robert Hamil-
ton's health!--- till she become Mrs. Walter Hamlyn.”
What can you possibly mean, my dear father ?” ex-
claimed Walter, now almost hoping that his father's mind
might be disturbed.
Why, that Hamilton is likely to bequeath her every
guinea of his three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, –
that is, if she should marry to please him."
“I trust she may,” was Walter's cold reply. “But it
certainly will not be through my offering her my hand.”
“Impossible to say,
till
you become acquainted with
the lady," pleaded his father, still undiscouraged.
“I can both say and swear it!” persisted Walter
Hamlyn.
“The eloquence of three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds may induce you to forswear yourself."
“Not where there exists a counterbalance of vulgarity

and pretension," cried the young man, his feelings warm
with claret and the recollection of Lucinda Vernon's
eyes. Nothing on earth,—no, my dear father!—I swear
that nothing on earth would ever induce me to unite
myself with a widow, rich or poor!”
“ Not even your father's entreaties, your father's
danger, your father's misery, your father's RUIN!”
demanded the elder Hamlyn, trembling in every limb,
and apparently on the verge of distraction.
- Take
heed of what you are saying, Walter!” added he, with a
glance that froze the young soldier's blood in his veins.
“ You know not what it is to live stretched on the rack
of a responsibility such as mine ;-to exist day after day,
and year after year, in all the agony and torture of having
a golden Pactolus stream, like the waters of Tantalus,
through your hands !-Very well for you, your mother,
your brother, who glide through life, enjoying without an
effort the fruit of my labours, of my joyless days,
my sleepless nights, my perilled salvation. Very welí
for you, I say, to disparage my toils, and recede from
this sacrifice, or refuse that exertion, while your father is
wearing himself down to the grave by his endeavours to
preserve the honour of the family !"-
Pausing for a moment in his impetuous volubility,
Mr. Hamlyn suddenly filled his glass with wine, and
swallowed it almost at a mouthful.
But
you may tax a man's faculties too far! cried
he, with renewed fervour. “And beware, Walter, beware
of driving me to distraction. I have this day cursed
your brother-cursed him with a bitter and cleaving
curse! I have this day raised my hand against my wife,
because she ventured to defend his disobedience. Do
not tempt me to further outrages, do not bring me to
further shame. Walter, you are my eldest-born, you are my
heir. I have ever loved you better than the rest. You
bear my father's name, you will one day be my father's
representative. For
I have toiled, for you
I have suf-
fered, for you I have sinned. Though the others are con-
spiring to bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the
grave,—my son, my son! let me not have to reckon you
among my enemies."

Convulsive sobs burst from the bosom of Richard
Hamlyn, as he concluded this frantic apostrophe; and
Walter, who no longer entertained a doubt of the mental
infirmity of his companion, knew not whether to soothe
or chide the morbid emotions of the sufferer. But though
apprehensive of augmenting the evil by any expression
of sympathy, the impulse of nature was not to be resisted;
and, taking the hand of his father, he held it for some
minutes in silence between his own, till warm tears
gushed from the eyes of the banker.
Thus relieved, he seemed by degrees to recover some
portion of tranquillity.
Forgive me for having agitated you, my dear boy,"
faltered he, at length, though, in fact, it was himself
alone who had given evidence of agitation. “I have this
day, Walter, gone through much to disturb my mind,
much to depress my courage.
Your brother has
grievously disappointed me. But we will talk of it
another time,-another time, when I am more composed.
Not a word on the subject to your mother. It is unfair
to entangle women in one's perplexities. They can afford
no support, -no counsel,--and only increase the evil by
their chicken-heartedness.”
“My dear father, I entreat, I implore you to explain
yourself!”—cried Walter, becoming more and more
alarmed, in proportion as his father appeared more ra-
tional. “Is there anything in which I can afford you
the least comfort,—the least assistance ?”—
“Nothing!"-replied Mr. Hamlyn. "Did you not
tell me, just now, that my utmost entreaties, and three
hundred and fifty thousand pounds, would not determine
you to marry a widow ? Such is the extent of your
filial piety! But, as I said before, we will discuss the
matter thoroughly another time."
“No! now,—10w !— What is there to prevent it?".
cried Walter Hamlyn.
“The irritation of my feelings. I cannot talk of it
with patience, I cannot talk of it with reason. Your
brother,--your cold blooded, selfish brother,--presumes
to-but no matter, no matter! When the stroke of
retribution
comes, it will fall on all, -root and branch

sapling and tree. Lord Vernon may triumph then to his
heart's content over Hamlyn the banker." Then, sud-
denly ringing the bell, as if to put a decisive stop to his
own rash disclosures—“Let us go in to coffee, Walter, my
boy!" said he, “ let us go in to coffee. They are expect-
ing us, they are waiting for us. But, remember, not a
syllable of all this to your mother."
This prohibition was, perhaps, as trying to Captain
Hamlyn's feelings as any part of the painful scene by
which it was preceded. For the first time in his life,
Walter was undergoing severe mental uneasiness; in
witnessing, for the first time, inconsistency and inco-
herency in one whom he had hitherto regarded as utterly
passionless--utterly immoveable ;-ruthless as destiny,
but steady as time. To behold the man of stone thus
passion-striken,—the man of business thus lost to all
considerations of prudence,-filled him with alarm. The
chain of the sheet-anchor of his fortunes seemed suddenly
snapt asunder; and what was to become of the luckless
vessel in which was embarked the welfare of his family?-
He could scarcely restrain his emotion on finding
himself once more in presence of his gentle and uncon-
scious mother. He trembled to think how thoroughly
her spirit would be overcome if exposed to the spectacle
of his father's inexplicable violence.
Scarcely, however, had he been five minutes in the
drawing-room, where Mrs. Hamlyn and Lydia were pur-
suing their customary evening avocations, when his father,
undisturbed in voice or mien, made his appearance,
and
joined cheerfully in conversation ; exhibiting no trace of
his flighty excitement after dinner, or his subsequent
depression.
The cold, calm, leaden-eyed banker was himself again ;
and as Walter contemplated this miraculous transition,
he trembled to consider how much of his father's habi-
tual serenity might be a matter of hypocrisy,-how much
of his decorum an effort of self-control. It was, perhaps,
only within the last half-hour he had witnessed indica.
tions of the real character of Hamlyn, the banker.

CHAPTER IX.
“To be loved by men, a man must appear to love them; and, for preserving
the appearance, I cannot think of any means so sure as the reality."-SELDEN.
WALTER HAMLYN retired to rest that night with the
determination of entreating an explanation from his father
early on the morrow; but, his rest having been singu-
larly disturbed by anxieties arising from the mysterious
communications of Mr. Hamlyn, intermingled with remi-
niscences of Miss Vernon's unusual graciousness, and
surmises touching the attractions of the "beautiful Ellen,"
his night was prolonged so far into the morning, that,
when he reached the breakfast-room, his father had al-
ready started for town, and the post-horses arrived to
convey his mother and sister to Rotherwood.
Vexed to have lost the opportunity of satisfying his
misgivings, Walter resolved to address himself by letter
to his father; and would probably have persisted through-
out the day in his quarrel with his own ill-timed laziness,
but for the consolations imparted to his feelings as a
sportsman, by a sudden thaw. Already, the slopes of the
park, half-covered with snow, were assuming the sort of
piebald complexion, so cheering to the eye of a despond-
ing fox-hunter; and, to crown his joy, the Ormeau hounds
were to meet the following morning at Alderham Gorse,
a capital covert within three miles of Dean Park.
“ Your father begged me to tell you, Walter," said
Mrs. Hamlyn, embracing her son with a dejected air, as
she was about to enter the carriage for her journey, “that
he had half-promised Colonel Hamilton you would dine
with him to-day. Do, my
dear
son, if not very disagree-
able to you! You have no excuse; for the Colonel is
aware that you are staying here alone.”
Pray do, dear Walter! He will be so very glad of
your company,” added Lydia, who was following her
mother through the portico. “He really feels towards
us as if we were his children. Make the old man happy,
therefore, by dining at Burlington to-day."

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Though averse at that moment to society of any kind,
(for Walter, though worldly and frivolous, bad too honour-
able a spirit to have already shaken off the painful im-
pressions produced by the alarming communications of
his father, he promised, ere the last signal of adieu was
exchanged with the travellers, to comply with their re-
quest; and a joyful man was the old Colonel, that day,
on finding that, instead of sitting down to his solitary
dinner, a claim was made on his hospitality for the pro-
mised prawn-currie and India Madeira.
But if Walter had indulged in momentary expectations
of obtaining from him the explanation he was prohibited
from seeking from his mother, he was speedily undeceived.
Before he had been five minutes at Burlington Manor,
he discovered that no interview had taken place between
the Colonel and his friend since their unlucky visit to
The Hyde.
“Hamlyn tipped me a chit, late last night," said he, in
the Ghazerapore slang to which the Hamlyns were now
accustomed, that he was forced to be off to town by day-
break this morning. Business, I suppose! A slice of the
loan, in the market, or some trifle of that sort; a Riga
correspondent wanting patching, eh? or a soap-manufac-
tory blown up in bubbles, leaving Hamlyn and Co. in the
suds! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, bless your soul and body,
these great money-dealers sleep as uneasily in their beds
as so many paupers in the Braxham Union. But now I
think on't, he mentioned something of a ballot at the
Indy House, for the election of your uncle, Andrew Har-
rington.”
Captain Hamlyn, aware that no terms of cordiality
subsisted between his father and uncle, saw at once in
this announcement a mere pretext for his abrupt de-
parture.
"And did my father say nothing further?" said he, with
assumed unconcern.
Only that as you and I were left solitary sparrows,
we'd better perch to-day on the same branch; that maybe
you'd dine with me, in compassion to my lonesomeness.
And, by George! it was mons'ously kindly thought of;
for, with nothing better in prospect than a tête-à-tête with

Pincher, I was beginning to repent I'd shirked the
Rother'ood party. Though I'm not fond of great lords
or gaudy days, (and The Hyde's been an additional sick-
ener on that score,) I'm still less fond of being alone.”
“But you are not to be alone long, I understand,"
observed Walter, half desirous, half afraid to hazard a
direct reference to the “beautiful Ellen." “My father
tells me, sir, that your daughter-in-law is likely to become
your inmate ?"
Ay, so she writes me word,” replied the old man, in
anything but a tone of exultation. “On my poor boy's
death, I wrote from Indy, doubling her jointur', as I had
then no home to offer her, or next to none; and feeling
she might entertain a grudge against the family, which
had shown itself in the first instance so loth to receive
her. But I told her, poor thing, at the same time, that,
if ever old John Hamilton had an English roof over his
head, there was bed and board and a hearty welcome for
her, when she'd a mind to try 'em. No occasion for her,
just then, to make up her mind. For her own health
was delicate with nursing him; and so she'd the wisdom
to abide her two years' widowhood in Italy, (where she’d
seen him droop into the grave!) and there's luckily been
time for all unpleasant feelings to subside between us,
afore our meeting.”
You expect her shortly, then ?”
“As soon as maybe, I fancy. I suspect your good
mother's friend, Lady Burlington, (with whom she made
acquaintance at Lucca last summer was a twelvemonth)
has been firing up her fancy with fine descriptions of the
beauties of the Manor; for this visit to England is quite
a sudden resolution.”
Α.
very
fortunate one for you, sir,” said Walter,

pretty prattle, and Mrs. Hamlyn's sound sense and plea-
sant company. I know she's handsome, for I've her
miniature yonder in the bureau, (a present from Bob to
his
poor mother;) and her influence over my boy, which
carried 'em through all the difficulties we threw in the
way of their marriage, proves that she's clever. But I
mayn't like her for all that. One seldom does like people
by whom one's aware of having dealt unkindly. One
behaves all the handsomer to 'em, by way of atonement,
but there's never a cordial liking. And so, you see, if
poor Ellen don't happen to take my fancy, her visit here
will be more a punishment than a pleasure. However,
no need to go in search of inisfortunes. Time enough to
take offence, when offence is given."
All this was strangely different from Mr. Hamlyn's
account of the Colonel's disposition towards his daughter-
in-law. But the old gentleman's projects might, perhaps,
have undergone some modification in consequence of his
recent observations on men and manners at The Hyde.
Meanwhile, Walter had no cause to repent his conces-
sion. Though disappointed in the main object of his
visit, the dinner was excellent, the Colonel chatty and
social; and the embarrassing taciturn meal at Dean Park,
the preceding day, was still too fresh in his recollection
not to impart a charm to the plain-spoken frankness of
his host. His father's dispiriting reserve placed strongly
in relief the warm, cordial nature of the good old Colonel,
whose heart was open to God and man, simply because
it contained nothing demanding concealment.
He saw that, though the abrupt truisms of Hamilton
might be out of place in such stilted society as that of
The Hyde, in the every-day intercourse of life, he was
worth á wilderness of Vernons. In the old soldier, no
hidden motives-no coquetting with his power-no
crooked policy.-Aware of the importance of the Ham-
lyns to his declining years, he made no secret of his
sense of dependence on their society; but welcomed
Walter to his house with the overflowing glee of one
who cannot do too much to
prove
his consciousness of
obligation.
“I've had that mealy-mouthed coxcomb, young Vernon,

here this morning," said the Colonel, after thanking
Walter heartily, at the close of dinner, for having bored
himself with such a téte-à-tête. “I can't abide that young
fellow! There's nothing real about him-nothing true.
I remember at Ghazerapore, a native who saw his brown
face for the first time in my looking-glass, insisting upon
taking it down from the wall to search for the substantial
figure behind the image. Now, when I'm talking to
master Alberic, I feel as if I should like to hoist out the
real man, instead of the pretence.”
“Did you expect him here to-day?" inquired Walter,
not a little mortified that Vernon should have found his
way to Burlington Manor, without so much as leaving a
card at Dean Park; an omission which he attributed, on
second thoughts, to Colonel Hamilton's indiscreet plea-
santries concerning his sister Lydia.
“I invited 'em all, if you remember. He came with
their apologies, and a pretence of examining the sledge;
and had the grace to say that, for a Brummagem build,
'twas by no means a bad turn-out. So I promised him if
there comes more snow while Lydia's away, to send it over
for the ladies at The Hyde.”
“You told him, then, that my mother and sister were
gone to Rotherwood ?" said Walter, his ruffled plumes
smoothed by the hope that the acknowledged absence of
the family had been the origin of the slight.
“He knew it-he knew it--for the very first question
he asked was, whether my friend, the Marquis of Dar'.
ford, was to be of the Rother'ood party?' Now that's
just one of the fellow's saucy unrealities. He knew
Dar'ford was not to be of the party, inasmuch as he's
attending his sick mother in another county. But he
chose to hint a make-believe of Mrs. Hamlyn and Lydia's
posting off after a young nobleman with forty thousand
a-year, and said as much as that he wished they might
get it-only in quality terms. On which, I gave him to
understand there was no need of any such waste of turn-
pike tickets; for that I'd never seen a young gentleman
more spoony, more loth to leave a place, or more anxious
to get back again, than my Lord Dar'ford to Dean Park.”
“I am sorry you alluded to the subject at all,” said

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Walter. “The Vernons, and even others less worldly,
would consider it the height of presumption on our part,
sir, to hint the possibility of such a preference; which,
to do
my mother and sister justice, never a moment
entered their heads."
“And why not, pray ?-And what right have the
Vernons, or e'er a body else, to call it presumption ?-
Lydia's as pretty and pretty-behaved a girl as any in the
British dominions, let t’other be whom she may!”
“But the disproportion of rank and fortune-
“What's fortune to a young fellow with forty thousand
a-year ? - What's rank to a Marquis, who may make any
Joan a lady? If Lord Dar'ford can't marry to please
himself, who can, I should like to know ?"
“He will probably please himself and his family at the
same time, some day or other, by choosing a wife in his
own sphere of society."
“Nonsense, nonsense! Do you pretend to arrange
men and women in classes, like plants and insects? Do
you want to make society a kitchen-garden, all the
spinach in one bed, all the endive in t'other --Lydia
does belong to his sphere of society. They are both
young folks of cultivated minds and refined manners;
though in both respects, betwixt ourselves, our little girl
has a plaguy deal the advantage."
“Yours is a very philosophical view of the case,'
replied Walter, wishing it had proceeded from the lips
of Lord Vernon rather than of the Colonel.
“But I
fear it will not stand against the battle-array of public
opinion. The Rotherwoods, for instance, are worthy,
unassuming people, and on friendly terms with my
family. But, rely on it, Lady Rotherwood would be
indignant at the idea of a marriage between her nephew
and my sister.”
“More shame for her, then, to have sat by simpering
as she did, while the Marquis was recommending himself
to dear Lydia with all his might and main. Why, what
the deuce is there against the match ?-That the girl's a
banker's daughter! What then? If she was a banker's
heiress, with fifty thousand a-year to her fortune, we
should baye all the Dukes in the land running after her,

and high and low praising their prudence. My dear
Watty, the day's past when noblemen thought it a fine
thing to sacrifice their own and their children's happiness
to the glory of having a titled name inscribed on a sham
apple in the family-tree hung up in their hall, (to my
thinking, as bitter an apple as the one that tempted
Mother Eve to sin !) Life isn't long enough for such
empty potter. The March of Intellect has left such
rubbish behind it, with other useless baggage. You
might as well pretend to believe in witchcraft or
the philosopher's stone, as in the Right Divine of the
peerage.”
“ No need to reprove my credulity," said Walter with
a smile. “On the contrary, sir, it is my interest to hope
you may gain proselytes wherever you play the apostle.
But, depend on it, pride of birth was never more in-
fluential in England than at this moment. All our in-
stitutions have an aristocratic tendency. The increasing
fusion or confusion of classes necessitates a sort of fana-
ticism in the Order whose privileges are invaded, just as
religious persecutions beget religious enthusiasm."
Mighty plausible, and famously worded," said the
Colonel. «"Twouldn't read amiss in a quarterly review,
from which, maybe, you cribbed it,-eh, Master Watty?
But 'tisn't sound, ʼtisn't sound, my boy!—'Tis as hollow
as a bubble. You know as well as I, that the most stiff-
necked of these aristocrats would marry his son or
daughter, at any time, to mine or your father's, on a
sufficient amount of temptation. And then, pray, what
becomes of their principles ? Never was there a great
heiress in England, be she whom she might, that all the
lords in the kingdom didn't run after, to say nothing now
and then of Princes of the Blood !"'
“But that will not persuade the World, sir, that the
daughter of Mr. Hamlyn, of Lombard Street, with five
thousand pounds, is a suitable wife for the Marquis of
Dartford.”
“If he's persuaded of it, let the world be--hanged.
As to the five thousand pounds' fortune, I'm sick of
seeing the happiness of God's creatures sacrificed to big
words. In the first place, what is the World ?-a few

Court cards, Kings, Queens, and Knaves, a trifle more
showy than the rest o' the pack! A few fine gentlemen,
who've jockied each other out of the right of deciding
who's fit company to eat his dinner, or play his rubber,
in certain houses in St. James's Street !-- That's the long
and short o' the World, Watty, as it stands in your
vocab'lary.”
“I dare say you are right, sir!" rejoined Walter,
throwing the stump of his cigar into the fire. “I've often
heard my brother declare as much. Harry pretends
that those who live out of society (such as himself, as a
scholar, or you as hermit) are in the position of aëronauts,
who, looking down on the earth, behold all things on the
same level,-mountain and molehill, city and village.”
“ And a plaguy good notion too!-ſ'hat was Harry's
idea, was it?-He and I should hit it off famously.”
“Harry is an original. Harry is a book-worm
“ And you a silk-worm, eh ?---Well, I can't approve
his taste in that particular. Reading's a famous thing
when talking's not to be had. Books are good company
enough, where there are no men or women. At Ghaze-
rapore, for instance, a new Magazine or amusing tour
was manna in the desert. But, thanks to the Bond
Street booksellers, yonder table's covered with 'em; and
'twould be a long time afore I thought of cutting open
the leaves, so long as I'd your pleasant company, or the
choice of dropping in to a rubber at Dean Park. By
the way, I suppose we shall be having your brother
at home shortly ?-He'll be of age, won't he, next
month ?”
“ Next month ?-February ?-Yes! I believe so.
Coming of age is an expression seldom used in a family,
unless for an eldest son. But Harry will be one-and-
twenty on the 19th of February."
"And in another month, I think Lydia told me, he's
to take his degree ?”
“You may rely on Lydia's information on any point
regarding him. I have lived less with my sisters. Harry
is decidedly the favourite."
“ 'Tis but fair the poor lad should be a favourite with
somebody or another!” observed the Colonel. “Betwixt

and me and the fire, Watty, you have it all
your own
way
with
your
father.”
“I should have thought you had seen enough of the
family, sir," replied Walter, “to be aware that no one
has a grain of influence with my father. In his own quiet
way, he is the most arbitrary man on earth.”
A pretty thing for you to say, my young spark ; when
you chose to be a soldier, (more's the credit to you,) in
spite of his teeth!—'Tis my notion that all eldest sons
are born with the bump of contradictiveness. There was
my poor boy! He, too, chose--But no matter! How-
ever, from something your mother hinted to me, tother
night, (as a reason for begging me not to mention
Harry's name just now afore his father,) I suspect my
friend Hamlyn's found cause to regret he did not pop
him into the banking-house, three years ago, instead of
sending him Latin-and-Greek-mongering to college.".
“ Has Harry been getting into scrapes, then, at Cam-
bridge ?” inquired Walter, sitting down again, though he
had just risen to depart. “Very unfair of him, not to
apply to me!-Very unfair of him,--very unkind.”
Maybe he might, if they were money-scrapes,
replied the Colonel, forgiving young Hamlyn his French
essences and varnished boots, in favour of his prompt
brotherly affection. “But I'm afraid he's likely to cross
his father's purposes, just as his brother did afore him.
Neither of my friend the banker's sons seems to inherit
much taste for the shop; one, 'cause he's a fine gentle-
man,--t'other, 'cause he's a whimsical gentleman. The
proverb doesn't always hold good that, ' As crows the old
cock, so crows the cockerel.'
“Do you mean to say, sir," demanded Walter, in
great surprise, “that Harry rebels against going into
the bank ?"
“Something of that kind, I fancy."
Why he must be out of his senses !"
“Were you mad, pray, when you raised the same
objection ?"
“I sometimes think so!" replied Walter, good-
humouredly. “But though my father compromised with
the insanity of his elder son, I fear he has not a sufficient

stock of patience for two. Consider what a loss to the
family, should anything happen to my father, if none of
us succeed him in the business !"
“I suppose that's what he pleaded to you, eh,-and
has now got to plead to Rebel the Second !—Mrs.
Hamlyn, I can tell you, is miserable about the matter;
and wanted me to use my influence with her husband.
But faith, I'm far more disposed to try my hand at
melting the obstinacy of the delinquent. On this occa-
sion, Hamlyn has reason on his side.”
“ To be sure he has ! What a provision for Harry to
reject! Such a standing as my father's ! Such a position
as that of an eminent London banker!"
“ Then why scout it yourself, Mister Jessamy ?”
* Harry and I are differently situated. His alternative
was an appointment in India."
“Was and is are two things! Harry Hamlyn, they
tell me, has distinguished himself prodigiously at the
University. The learned professions are open to him.
Public life's open to him.”
“So it will be, if he fulfil my father's intentions. The
great object of my brother's going to Cambridge was to
qualify him for the House of Commons, (for which I have
not the smallest vocation.) One day or other, my father
will resign him his seat for Barthorpe.”
“Pending which, he's to wear away the best of his
days in Lombard Street, trying to prove to the money,
changers that two and two make five,—with a quill
behind his ear, and the price of stocks always ringing in
it. See what such a life has done for Hamlyn-
shrivelled him into a mummy! Why, at eight-and-
forty, your father's an older man at heart, than I at
sixty-seven, after grilling away my constitution between
the tropics. But mind, Master Watty! All this is as
confidential as a Governor-General's despatch. Don't
go and let the cat out of the bag, and get me called over
the coals for blabbing."
“It is a poor compliment to my head or heart," said
Walter, (bitterly enough for a dandy,) "that I am the
last
person to be made acquainted with the troubles of
my family!"

“Can't you understand that they feel a delicacy about
involving you in a question of filial rebellion ? 'Harry
could hardly complain of his fortunes to you,-his ex-
pensive, pampered, elder brother,—without running the
risk of giving you pain.”.
“At all events, cried Walter, piqued almost out of
his generous feelings towards his brother, "since no one
thinks me worth consulting, I may spare myself the
trouble of giving an opinion. Good night, Colonel
Hamilton! I shall not have the pleasure of seeing you
to-morrow. The hounds meet at half past ten, and we
have a heavy country before us.'
“Not see me? No such thing !" cried the old man.
“ The meet's at Ald’rham Gorse, and I mean to drive
over to covert. Though my sporting days are over, I
don't see why I shouldn't give myself the treat of looking
at a neat turn-out, when the thing's within distance.
I'll call for you in the barouche, and your horses can
meet you at Ald'rham. So, good night, my dear Walter,
and pleasant dreams t'ye!"
The covert-side is one of the most sociable gathering-
places of a sporting county; the fountain-head of its
feuds and reconciliations,—its politics and scandal. Even
the veteran sportsmen of the neighbourhood, long retired
from the active pleasures of the field, make it a point to
repair to the "coffee-room," whenever a meet takes place
within reasonable distance.
Few country spectacles more exciting, in short, than
the rendezvous of a favourite pack; to which, on all sides,
equipages are repairing in full animation, from the
family coach of the squire to the knowing dog-cart of the
dealer. Natty grooms, leading their masters' horses, and
jealously watching the condition of the grooms and horses
of other masters,—the sportsmen themselves, arriving
singly, doubly, or in groups, on their hacks,-in their
mouths a cigar, or a reprimand for the luckless lad who
is sure to be too late or too early, or have heated their
hunters in zeal to prove over-punctual ;--and finally, the
weather-beaten, shrewd-faced old huntsman and sturdy
whip, part and parcel of their well-known steeds,-centaurs,
whose man-moiety is encased in scarlet and black velvet,

followed by, or following, the pack of eager, high-couraged
hounds, who move together, vivacious and compact, as
though a quarter of an acre of far from spotless snow were
suddenly endued with life ;-all conspire to impart to the
winter landscape a degree of vigour and vitality such as,
amid the more vivid impulses of summer, a race-course
alone calls into action.
All the world, animate or inanimate, is in towering
spirits. Care is forgotten,—business laid aside. The
statesman renounces his politics,—the country-doctor
neglects his patients,-the bridegroom
forgets the bride
Was made his wedded wife yestreen,”-
the farmer defies his wife's probibitions, and the farmer's
son the farmer's, the moment the hounds are heard or
seen making their way towards the spot, where from two
score to four hundred healthy, happy individuals are
met together for the annihilation of a monster two feet
long, whose direst offence against the community consists
in robbing a hen-roost!
It was the first time in his life Colonel Hamilton had
witnessed this cheering spectacle; and his eager spirits
readily took fire as he drove towards Alderham Gorse, en-
countering at every turn of the road some neighbour
whose scarlet coat and snow-white leathers gave him the
appearance of a stranger; or some stranger whose clever
turn-out rendered him an object of interest and curiosity.
Having persuaded Walter to bear him company in the
barouche, the young sportsman found himself every
moment compelled to take his cigar from his mouth, to
satisfy the inquisitiveness of his companion.
" Who the deuce is that crossing the turnip-field ?"
cried the Colonel. “Why, by George ! 'tis old Barlow
himself, looking as fresh as a four-y'r old, and all the
more consequential to-day that the meet's on his own
ground. I didn't know Barlow was a sportsman. Yet
his hunting-coat seems to have seen service. And who
have we here, that the farmers and grooms are uncapping
to as though 'twas the Governor-General,-in a bit of
pink that looks as if turned out by a milliner, rather than

a tailor,—and a strawberry and cream complexion to
match ? Ugh!-I thought so !—I knew't could be no
other than the young jackanapes from The Hyde."
Walter Hamlyn felt almost ashamed of the impulse
which prompted him, at that moment, to look out eagerly
on the opposite side, (at a restive colt which was doing
its best to unseat one of the Alderham farmers,) as a
pretext for not bowing to Alberic Vernon, while thus
familiarly accompanying, in his own carriage, the man so
outrageously contemned at The Hyde. But there was
no fear of his guileless companion detecting his pitiful
motives. The Colonel was engrossed, heart and soul, eye
and ear, by the stirring scene before him.
" By George! what a splendid creatur',” cried he;
“that bay, I mean, from which the helper has just shifted
the saddle-cloth. Why, 'tis a pictur' for an artist ! -
Worth three hundred guineas, if it's worth a pound !
Whose is it, I wonder?"
“ This is only the third time I have been out this
winter," replied Walter, "and I scarcely know a horse in
the field. Lord Cossington is usually the best-mounted
of the Ormeau party; but he would have had one of the
hunt-grooms in attendance. The bay, probably, belongs
to a stranger. We are pretty sure to have some wonder-
ful turn-outs from Leamington.”
The stir and bustle were now every moment increasing,
till they reached the outskirts of the gorse, whose dingy
verdure looked almost as gay in the midst of winter-
nakedness, as its golden blossoms rendered the spot at
midsummer, amid surrounding verdure. Many a manly,
weather-bitten face was turned benignantly towards
Colonel Hamilton, as they drove through a jolly group
of fustian-suited but famously-mounted sportsmen, the
farmers of the neighbourhood; and Walter was almost
piqued to perceive that among them, as well as among the
country-gentlemen, his companion, though so new a comer
into the county, was better recognised than his father's
son, the hereditary squire of Dean Park. There was
something peculiarly cordial in their mode of touching
their hats to the old soldier, with whose manly calling
and liberality as a Lord of the Manor they experienced

TIL BANKER'S WIFE;
more sympathy than was compatible with the demure,
cautious, and sedentary nature of the banker; whom,
though affecting the War'ickshire squire, they could
never bring themselves to regard otherwise than as
Hamlyn of Lombard Street.
A thousand friendly greetings and uproarious “how-
are-ye’s” were exchanged between the Colonel and the
lesser squirearchy of Braxham and Ovington, of whose
existence, after the fashion of The Hyde, the Hamlyns
affected to have no cognizance; till Walter was so much
embarrassed by their familiarity with his companion, that
he was glad to descry his groom and hunter.
In a moment, he was out of the carriage ; which the
Colonel, in compliance with the advice of his jocose friend,
had caused to be drawn up on a rising ground, command-
ing a view of the covert and vale of Alderham, which the
fox, when found, was most likely to take.
“What a thousand pities your mother and sister were
forced to go to Rother'ood !"-exclaimed the Colonel,
Walter turned, on the carriage-step, to give him a part-
ing nod. “Lydia would have enjoyed all this. By
George! it almost tempts me to call out like the man in
the play for a horse--a horse!' I shouldn't be surprised,
afore the season's over, to find myself in the saddle, among
the best of ye, galloping like the tailor to Brentford, or
John Gilpin to Ware.
At that moment, Walter Hamlyn sincerely wished the
noisy old man, whether mounted or on foot, anywhere
but where he was. For a carriage with the Vernon
liveries was fast approaching; and sooner than be found
in company with the obnoxious arraigner of the Earl of
Clansawney, the Bayard of the Blues resolved to flee
before the face of the lady of his knightly thoughts.
By the time the blooming cheeks of Susan Middlebury
and her cousin were perceptible from the carriage-window,
screening their eyes with their hands from the trying
glare of the winter sunshine as they gazed with eager
curiosity upon the motley group, Walter was apparently
absorbed in a highly interesting discussion with his groom,
touching his stirrup-leathers.
“Good morning, Colonel Hamilton,-a charming day

for the field !-I think I may venture to point out the
scene before us to your admiration, as one of the most
national and characteristic in Great Britain,” shouted
Sir Henry Middlebury, who was enacting the part of
chaperon to his daughters and niece. And while the
courteous old soldier attempted to mingle with his reply
a succession of salutations to his lovely companions,
Walter Hamlyn stood obstinately afar off, dreading to be
confounded by the fair Lucinda with his homely friend.
At that moment, a general buzz and murmur an-
nounced an occurrence of some importance,-some luck-
less sportsman unhorsed, or some presuming bumpkin
chastised. Equestrians rose in their stirrups, and pedes-
trians on their tiptoes ; while the inmates of the half
dozen carriages on the ground peered out with an air of
interest. “The Duke!—the Duke!" was instantly passed
like a watch-word from lip to lip, as a gentlemanly, middle-
aged man, mounted on a horse, (whose value was equal to
that of a moderate farm,) rode hat in hand through the
knot of sportsmen assembled at the lower extremity of
the covert ; accommodating the pace of his noble steed to
the amble of a crop-eared, strange-looking, old shooting
pony, surmounted by the scarecrow figure of old Grat-
wycke of Gratwycke; who rode beside his Grace of
Elvaston, looking something between an earth-stopper
and the clown's assumption of a cockney sportsman in a
Christmas-pantomime.
The Duke entertained the highest respect for Mr.
Gratwycke of Gratwycke;—first, as the head of the most
ancient family in the county; next, as the stanchest pre-
server of its foxes ; and thirdly, as the most active and
conscientious seconder of the politics of the House of
Ormeau. Finer gentlemen were at all times disregarded by
the Elvastons, to make way for a Gratwycke of Gratwycke.
“What on earth brings old Grat. and his pony out to-
day ?” muttered Mr. Barlow of Alderham.
“What under Heaven keeps the Duke maundering
yonder with Gratwycke, when Bowie is putting the
hounds into covert?" exclaimed in his turn Alberic
Vernon; as the king of the field pushed his way side by
side with the queer-looking old gentleman, straight towards

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
the carriage of Colonel Hamilton ; within a few yards of
which stood young Vernon, admirably mounted, and, in
spite of his horror of the Duchess's Irish nieces, in hopes
of catching the eye of the Duke, and obtaining an invita-
tion to Ormeau.
But the “Frenchified prig” was precisely the sort of
youth to move at the utmost an indulgent smile on the
countenance of the noble sportsman. Passing with a
slight bow of recognition the unpromising son of one of
his least estimable neighbours, his Grace fulfilled his pre-
concerted purpose of soliciting an introduction from old
Gratwycke to the new lessee of Burlington Manor.
Though Ormeau was situated in another county, whereof
it formed the leading influence, the benevolent habits and
guileless character of Colonel Hamilton were understood
and appreciated by the Duke of Elvaston.
By this spontaneous mark of respect on the part of a
man so universally respected as the Duke of Elvaston, the
old Colonel was inexpressibly gratified; and he sat lean-
ing with a brightened countenance from the carriage, to
receive the thanks of his Grace for his attention to the
only covert on the Burlington estate; as well as a hearty
invitation to Ormeau.
If
you
will come and see me," said the Duke, cor-
dially, “I will show you the height we consider the right
thing for thorns, in the coverts on my side the county.
The late Sir Roger Burlington being at variance with me
on political and other matters, always decided that we
lived out of visiting distance; which is so far true, that
a range of fourteen miles is convenient or inconvenient
according to the liking of the parties. I shall sincerely
rejoice if Colonel Hamilton will permit me to number
him among my near neighbours."
And as he courteously raised his hat while receiving
the worthy Colonel's frank reply, and then rode on to-
wards the huntsman, leaving old Gratwycke to potter
with his friend, not a man in the field but experienced a
certain accession of deference towards the stranger whom
the Duke they so dearly valued delighted to honour.
But of all present, Walter Hamlyn was the on
whom his Grace's attentions produced the strongest im-

pression. At one moment, mortified to see civilities
volunteered by the noble owner of Ormeau to a stranger
in the county in which his father, an established landed
proprietor, had never obtained from him more than a
distant bow, he was inclined to rejoice, the next, at a
mark of distinction which must have equally astonished
and vexed the supercilious heir-apparent of The Hyde.
“ This will teach the Vernons to think twice before
they insult a friend of
my
father's !” was his inward com-
ment. And while accusing the Middleburys of meanness
for the pains they were already taking to enter into con-
versation with the Colonel, he forgot to blush for the
shabbiness which had prompted him to shrink from the
side of his good old friend.
During the silence that now superseded the boisterous
gossip of the groups of sportsmen, while the hounds were
pushing their way into the gorse, Walter was musing in
most unsportsmanlike guise upon the singular popularity
of Colonel Hamilton.
“'Tis altogether unaccountable!" murmured he. “Ordi-
nary in appearance, (not to say vulgar in manners,) -
moderate in abilities,-uncultivated, -illiterate,-neither
a sportsman, nor an agriculturist, nor a politician,-he
comes here, an utter stranger, and makes the conquest of
every family of note in the neighbourhood! The Duke
of Elvaston rarely troubles himself to be civil to but
fox-hunters; Lord Rotherwood cares only for farmers;
Lord Crawley for Tories; Dartford for his brother officers.
Yet one and all have singled out Colonel Hamilton for a
favourite! What is the meaning of this ? To them his
fortune is nothing. It must be the genuine cordiality of
the old man's nature which begets cordiality in return.
One might almost fancy that some counter-charm was at
work to frustrate my father's desire to keep him on terms
of exclusive intimacy with our family."

ton, when they met the following day at dinner, at the
unpretending board of Ovington Vicarage, that your
good father's promises concerning a winter in War’ick-
shire were quite on the safe side of things! Why, in pro-
posing to me the tenancy of his ward's seat of Burlin’ton
Manor, Hamlyn expressly said it had little to offer in the
way of society, beyond his own fireside, which was open
to me at all times; and our good friends, the present
company, who, he promised me, would be charitable
enough to put up with the intrusions of a troublesome
old fellow, likely to beat the Doctor at backgammon, and
be less grateful than he ought for the prescriptions of the
Doctor's good lady. He told me frankly, I might whistle
for the civilities of The Hyde; and that Ormeau being in
another county, might as well be in another kingdom.
Well, sir! I wasn't daunted. I signed, sealed, and de-
livered, in spite of all he said to prove I was going to be
as lonesome at Burlin’ton as Robinson Crusoe, with only
himself for my man Friday.”
“ We have all the more to thank you, my dear sir,
said Dr. Markham, cheerfully, "for your confidence in
our good will to make you happy among us.”
“But just admire, Doctor, how much better my
friend
Hamlyn has been than his word. See how he's managed
matters for me! Invitations to Rother'ood Castle-to
Dar'ford Hall—to Lord Vernon's—to the Duke of Elva-
ston’s--twice as many, in short, as I care to accept. This
is acting the part of a friend by one. However, I can do
very well without lords and ladies. Betwixt Dean Park
and my friends here and at Gratwycke, I needn't spend
an evening a-week at home, more than I please."
At this undeserved compliment, Walter Hamlyn felt
the colour rise to his temples; for no one knew better than

the Markhams Mr. Hamlyn's utter inability to work the
miracles ascribed to him. The Doctor was, however,
sufficiently considerate towards his embarrassment to
devote himself assiduously at that moment to the study
of the glass; while Captain Hamlyn attempted a slight
disclaimer.
“My father has every disposition, sir," said he, "to
you
all these accessions and more, to your comfort
at Burlington. But the will is not always the power."
“ Tisn't for my own share I care about the matter!"
retorted the Colonel. “ As far as I'm concerned, Dean
Park and Ovington Vicarage comprise all I ever wish to
see of society. The Hyde is about as cheerful as a model.
penitentiary; and though the Rother’oods are excellent
folks, I've seen faster-coaches in my time. But I'm
mighty glad to have secured a little change for poor Ellen!
After living abroad, she'll find the Manor as dull, maybe,
as I find Lord Vernon's state-prison. But now, if she
wants younger
faces than mine and
my
friend Hamlyn's,
at Rother'ood she'll have a sight of the young Marquis,
and at Ormeau of the young Marquis multiplied by ten.
If among 'em all she find nothing to suit her, the deuce
is in't.”
Walter Hamlyn felt surprised, almost indignant, at the
idea of this exposure of the "beautiful Ellen,” who had
been all but offered to himself, the presumptive heiress of
three hundred and fifty thousand pounds, to the coveting
of the roué sportsmen somewhat freely intermingled with
the stately circle of Ormeau. But it was not for him to
remonstrate.
" Any news to-day from the travellers?" inquired Dr.
Markham, of Walter.
None,” replied Walter. “But with such roads, such
carriages, and such weather, journeys are not very alarm-
ing."
“ There might have come ill-news, short of a break-
down, however," replied the Colonel, vexed at his listless-
ness. “My good friend, Mrs. Hamlyn was but so-so
when she left home."
My mother wanted change of air and scene. She
leads too sedentary a life.”

“A life of duty and diligence," said the Vicar. “Her
candle goeth not out by night. Like the wise matron
of Solomon's time, she maketh herself coverings of
tapestry, and layeth her hand to the spindle.'
I hope for a letter from Rotherwood to-morrow," ob-
served Walter, who always fancied when people quoted
Scripture in his presence, that they were talking at him.
“I am most anxious to know about Lady Dartford, on
the state of whose health depends whether Dar. is likely
to meet me at Melton next week.”'
“Next week? Why you're surely not going to start
next week ?” cried the Colonel. “ Shan't you wait till
Madam Hamlyn and Lydia come back? Shan't you be
here to make acquaintance with Ellen ?”
"I think of returning to Dean Park, sir, a few weeks
hence. This is the best part of the season for Melton.
All
my friends are there just now.”
" By George! that puts me deucedly out in my plans,
cried Colonel Hamilton, unreservedly. “I was going to
ask a favour of you, Master Watty. I've a mons'ous
mind to have a peep at one of your fine universities; and
thought of giving myself a scamper over to Cambridge,
and asking you to be my dragoman.'
“ Had it been in my power to accompany you, my dear
sir, I should of course have pleaded for Oxford,” replied
Captain Hamlyn. “Bound to be faithful to Christ-
church, am I not, Dr. Markham ?!!
• But I want to see a thing or two at Cambridge, mas-
ter Watty, besides King's College Chapel. I want to see
Henry Hamlyn-I want to have a talk with your brother.”
“In that case, sir, you are infinitely better without me,'
replied Walter, dreading a more distinct allusion, in pre-
sence of the Markhams, to the divided state of his family,
and still smarting under the want of confidence of his
brother. “ It would take me a hundred miles out of
my
way to attempt Cambridge on my road from Ovington to
Melton Mowbray.”
- Ay, ay ? Well, I've made a circumbendibus of a
thousand miles in Indy, afore now, to serve a friend; and
a brother's the friend given us by God. However, I
won't insist upon a plan that deranges your fox-hunting.

I dare
say Johnston and I can manage to settle with the
postboys, and find out the road to Trinity College, by
following our own long noses.”
“I was thinking—" said Mrs. Markham, as if about to
unfold some serious project, then suddenly stopping short,
under the influence of the awe which habitually prevented
her from expounding her thoughts, except to the Vicar.
"Well, my dear ma'am ?” persisted the Colonel, in-
capable of suspecting shyness on the part of a full-grown
woman of two-and-thirty, “what were you thinking ?”
“Oh! nothing, sir, nothing very particular! Only it is
a great many years since the Doctor was at Cambridge,-
but once since he married, when he took his Doctor's
degree.”
>>
“You're a Cambridge man, then, are you, Doctor ?"
interrupted the Colonel, not seeing hier drift, because
little surmising that his presence could so impose on any
person as to induce reserve.
“An old Johnian,” replied Dr. Markham ; "and my
little wife has it in her head, I perceive, that I should
enjoy a trip to my bachelor haunts.”
By George! a capital thought,” cried the Colonel.
“My dear lady, why didn't you speak out? Is Markham
such a bully behind the curtain, that you
daren't call the
tongue in
your
head
your own? But I say, Doctor, how
are we to manage about the shop? Who's to make the
poor folks of Ovington wiser and better, on Sunday next,
during our frolic?
“ As I have not been a day absent from home for the
last three years,” replied Dr. Markham, “I have many
debts of service from my clerical brethren to call in.
Having done duty some thirty times for my good friend
Hurst of Braxham, he will not grudge me a single Sunday
in return."
“ That's well settled then!” cried the Colonel, setting
down a cup of tea, which, by the care of his thrifty
hostess, he fancied a thousand times better than he
drank at home. “I like the thought of our excursion
mons’ously, Doctor. And mind, on our return, I'll tell
no tales, no histories about favourite old laundresses with
cherry-coloured ribbons. You started the hare, my dear

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
ma'am, and I can't promise you when or where 'twill sit.
And now, what say ye to a hit at backgammon ?"
“ What command of countenance you must have, my
love, not to have laughed out this evening, when Colonel
Hamilton was thanking young Hamlyn so cordially for
his father's interposition with the Duke of Elvaston!”
said Mrs. Markham to her husband, an hour or two
afterwards, when the sound of the Colonel's chariot-
wheels on the gravel announced the departure of their
guests.
“It was no fault of Captain Hamlyn's that the old
gentleman chose to account for his grace's civilities in his
own way.'
“Not Captain Hamlyn's. But the father never lets
slip an occasion of magnifying the extent of his services.
Mr. Hamlyn fancies himself as much the guardian of
Colonel Hamilton, as of poor little Sir Hugh Burlington.
He has evidently made up
his mind to secure every guinea
of the Colonel's property for his children.”
* “ Which of us would not, were it in our power? Be-
tween three and four hundred thousand pounds! Why, his
year's income would make a noble provision for our boys."
“ The more reason that Mr. Hamlyn, who is rolling in
riches, should have the generosity to leave a chance for
other people. What is there in this world,—what com-
fort, -what luxury,—that man does not enjoy ?"
“We have no reason to find fault with his good for-
tune," observed Dr. Markham, warmly.
• Never were
the church's dues kept back a quarter of an hour by
Richard Hamlyn! And then, such an example to the
poor; never betrayed into an angry word or harsh mea-
sure; his family as constant to divine service as Rugson,
the clerk. Fair or foul, rain or shine, when was the Dean
Park pew ever empty? As to the banker's wife, show
me her equal for sense and temper! Verily, her price is
above rubies.”
“An easy matter for people to keep an even temper
who are never ruffled by the difficulty of making two
ends meet,” observed poor Mrs. Markham, a leetle jealous.
"Life goes glib enough for those who roll through it on
golden castors !"

“I am sure, my dear love, we have little cause to com-
plain," cried the conscientious Vicar. 66 And think of the
advantages we derive from having such a friend as Mr.
Hamlyn. Think how kindly he has managed our little
fortune, with as much interest as if we belonged to his
family. Your three thousand pounds, my dear, and the
fifteen hundred of my college-savings, would have re-
mained £4,500 to the day of doom, for any power I had
of multiplying the product. But, instead of the miserable
hundred and sixty pounds a-year we should have got from
the public funds, Hamlyn has managed to obtain me two
hundred, by an excellent mortgage. For the last five
years, the interest has been accumulating: for I had
rather go without butter to 'my bread, than touch a
shilling of what I always promised to lay by as a provision
for the boys
“And poor little Kitty," interposed the wife.
“So that, in addition to what now amounts to two hun.
dred and forty pounds per annum, we have nearer six
thousand pounds than five, to bequeath to the children.
All this, my love,-as you ought never to forget,—is
Hamlyn's doing !"
“I never do forget it!" replied poor Mrs. Markham;
“and I suspect he never forgets it either. When any-
thing goes wrong in the parish, or the churchwarden gives
him trouble, he addresses you in a tone far less respectful
than he does Mr. Ramsay, his butler."
“But for this security for our family,” said Dr.
Markham, earnestly, “ we should be unable, out of my
small living, to do half we now do for the poor. Not
that there is much call upon us for more than trifles,'
added be, in a tone of compunction.—“The schools
and infirmaries of Ovington supported by him were
cited in the Education Committee before the House,
and mentioned in the Quarterly Review !-Moreover,
Hamlyn's connexion with the County Institution, the
Lunatic Asylum, County Hospital, Grammar schools, and
so forth, is of inestimable advantage to my parishioners."
“Still, I can't divest myself of the idea that his con-
nexion with these charities is purely a matter of business.
To
one, he is treasurer; the others bank with his firm.

It is not, for instance, like the good-Samaritan, out-of-
the-hear tsort of charity that opens the purse-strings of
Colonel Hamilton !"
“My dearest wife, I could almost fear you were envious
of the prosperity of the Hamlyns !” said the Vicar, gravely,
“ Must I say to you, like the preacher of old, Instead
of a friend, become not an enemy: for thereby shalt thou
inherit an ill-name, even as a sinner that hath a double
tongue ?!"
“I dare say I am very wrong," replied his wife, meekly.
“ If you say so, I must be wrong. But for all that, I can-
not help feeling that Mr. Hamlyn (to use Mrs. John-
ston's expression) has fixed his grappling irons into the
good Colonel at Burlington Manor.
“Mrs. Johnston ?-The Colonel's old housekeeper?"
“Who declares that nothing has gone right in the
Hamilton family since Mr. Hamlyn got the management
of their affairs ...The children were sent off to Europe,
fine healthy babes; and one after the other, all dropped
off.”
“Does the old lady accuse poor Hamlyn, then, of poison-
ing his friend's children ?" said the Doctor, laughing out-
right at the earnest tone of his wife.
“Not exactly. But she really thinks him gifted with the
evil eye. Because it suited the banker, she says, to stake
down her master within range of Dean Park, away from
London and his friends, the poor old gentleman was
hustled out of his fine house in Portland Place.”
“At his age, hustled out of his house !"
“And now they are down in the country, she complains
that all his rarities, all his good things, find their way to
Dean Park,- mangoes, — buffaloes'-humps,- oranzetas.
Day after day, the finest flowers in the conservatory are

“I don't deny it; and so would double the number

their own. They certainly manage to feather their nest,
while other bids, less active, are driven forth from theirs !
-Poor Lady Burlington !- Poor little Sir Hugh! Little
did I think, when the bells rang for that dear boy's birth,
as heir to one of the finest estates in the county, that,
within five years, child and mother would be in exile, and
the father in his grave!"
"What had Hamlyn to do, my dear, with Sir Roger
Burlington's flinging away his money on the turf ?”
“If he had not facilitated the mortgages on his estates,
Sir Roger would not have been able to embarrass his
property to such an extent."
“Where there is a will to be extravagant, there is
always a way. And Hamlyn's capital management in
letting the Manor will bring the minor round, so that he
will not be the worse for his father's improvidence.”
The Vicar might have spared his defence. The blame
of stewards’-rooms or parsonage-parlours was as unim-
portant to the reputation of Hamlyn the banker, as the
ripple of a midsummer sea to the stability of the Eddy-
stone Lighthouse! Established on his Lombard Street
throne as firmly as the sovereign on that of St. James,
Richard Hamlyn bad defiance to petty slanders. All
about him was fair and
prosperous.
His house was built
The firm of Hamlyn and Co., if unsupported by enor-
mous capital in the private property of the partners, was
trebly secure in its own moderation, steadiness, and good-
renown. Bernard Hamlyn, the junior and virtually
sleeping-partner, was the son of an uncle of Richard's';
who, dying at the same period as the rash constructor of
Dean Park, had left a schoolboy—and a remarkably dull
one-on the hands of his nephew, as his successor to a
moiety of the business. Luckily for the comfort of the
more qualified cousin, Bernard, on attaining his majority,
experienced no ambition to disturb his excellent manage-
ment. All he desired was, that his cousin should be
punctual in his quarterly surrender of half the profits of
the concern, deducting two thousand per annum for his
own trouble.
Richard Hamlyn was consequently sole monarch of all
upon a rock.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
he surveyed in his temple of Mammon in Lorbard Street.
Not that it exhibited much superficiał splendour to excite
his vain-glory. The house was of dingy brick, with low-
browed, smoke-stained ceilings, and desks and counters of
oak; unlike those gorgeous banking-houses of the day
which seem to have thriven, like parasite plants, on the
substance of others. The walls of the counting-house
were of stucco, discoloured to a sallowness of complexion
almost rivalling that of their proprietor. Even the round
time-piece hung thereon was an old-fashioned piece of
goods; like the staring eye of Time, keeping watch over
the quill-driving community below.
Whenever a defaulter entered that grim tabernacle of
money-changing to account for a dishonoured acceptance,
explain away an ugly balance sheet, or implore indulgence
for a pending claim, the rigidly business-like character of
the spot insinuated in iron whispers, as in Dante's Inferno,
that“ ogni speranza” might as well be left on the thres-
hold. Whereas, when a new client, well to do in the
world, and about to make a heavy deposit, pushed his way
through the swing-doors whose panes were fiercely de-
fended by a strong iron network, he was apt to murmur,
-“Good! business-like, and good! No show, no flum-
mery, no take in.” Even the mechanical demureness of
the middle-aged clerk who took down his name and ad-
dress, returning, in the same unconcerned manner, his
own receipt for thousands or tens of thousands, " to ac-
count for on demand," inspired more confidence than
the whipper-snapper moppings and mowings of West
End obsequience.
In that vast, dingy, dreary chamber, however, with
its double row of desks and stools, its leaden standishes
and buff-bound folios, its foul atmosphere and factory-
like whirr, in that chamber presenting no single object
pleasing to the ear or eye, a mere integument, as it were,
among the viscera of commerce,-in that joyless, loveless,
graceless spot, whatever the banker might become among
the domestic irritations of Dean Park, “ Richard was him-
self again!" the Talleyrand of admiring stockbrokers and
bewildered cashiers.
Strange to relate, little as the banker was liked else-

163
where, in his house of business he was adored. His
clerks had either grown gray in the house, or were the
sons of its antecedent graybeards. Among these, the
banker was a demigod; partly because, in a region where
pelf was the one thing needful, a strong box the ark of
the covenant, and the multiplication-table the table of the
law, the moneyed man, the man possessed both of the
substance, Property, and the shadow, Credit, was a
prophet-yea, more than a prophet; but also, in some
measure, on account of his fair and generous dealings
with the persons in his employ.
In the first place, he was a Sultan without a Vizier.
56 L'état c'est moi” was his Bourbonic rule of government.
There was no confidential clerk to“ principal” it over the
rest; but scarcely one of them, who had not, at some
moment or other, become the object of his munificence;
either at his marriage, the sickness of a child, the death
of a parent, or some other domestic exigency, which ap-
peared to reach the ears of the head of the firm as if
carried thither by a bird of the air. These were acts of
great mercy, or strokes of great policy ; like the visit of
Napoleon to his plague-stricken soldiers, or of Louis
Philippe to a cholera hospital; and the clerks thus be-
friended became the faithful freed-men of a new Cæsar.
Every day, when Hamlyn passed through the counting-
house, -spruce, black, lustrous, into the city-throng,
(where wealth walks the streets, and the shabby fellow
you run against at the corner of Cornhill carries, perhaps,
sixty thousand pounds, in bank-notes, in the inner-pocket
of his seedy surtout,) the clerks nearest the window would
peer over the blinds to watch, with eyes of affection, his
exit into the street; where hats were respectfully touched
to him by the men of substance; while the sweeper at the
crossing for once forbore to be vociferous, so certain was
he of receiving a spontaneous gratuity from “good Mr.
Hamlyn!"
Though the head of the firm of Hamlyn and Co. re-
frained from flourishing at any moment in the eyes of his
people, the insignia of his opulence—though he arrived in
Lombard Street from Cavendish Square in the same
shabby gig which had made its journey thither daily for

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
years so punctual to its minute, that, had Hamlyn and his
groom been wanting, the old bay-horse would doubtless
have conveyed the vehicle in safety among the coal-carts
and omnibuses of the Strand, and stopped, from the force
of habit, at precisely eleven minutes and a half past ten
at the counting-house door,—they loved to know that an
admirably-appointed equipage would convey their re-
spected principal at half past seven to his dinner at the
Speaker's, or the Archbishop of Canterbury's, or some
wealthy country-baronet of a client, in Curzon Street or
Eaton Square. Rejoicing in the solid comfort of his es-
tablishment, they were proud to feel that Dukes were his
guests, and Privy Councillors his claret-companions; and,
on the mornings following a debate of which“ Mr. Ham-
lyn next rosé," formed a prominent feature in the columns
of the daily papers, the Times and Herald belonging to
the neighbouring chop-houses assumed an additional coat-
ing of thumb-grease, thanks to the diligent and reiterated
perusal of the clerkhood of Hamlyn and Co.
It was indeed gratifying, after efforts of eloquence such
as had drawn forth the thanks of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and groans of anguish from the opposition
benches, to find their great man calm and affable as usual.
Even the clerk, whose function it was to inscribe the
names of Messrs. Hamlyn in the subscription-lists brought
round to the merchants and bankers of the metropolis,
whether for the erection of a statue to some eminent
slayer of men, or hospital for the sick and maimed created
under his slaughter, could scarcely refrain from adding
an additional flourish to the “ Co.,” which at present
represented only the refractory Henry, and a sickly son of
Bernard Hamlyn, still under birchment at Harrow.
In his dingy little skylighted back-shop or parlour, ---
the consulting-room of his financial science, the boudoir
of his moneyed leisure, Richard Hamlyn, surrounded by
his iron safes and deed-chests, was entitled to seclude him-
self like some alchemist of the olden time; saving that he
was successful in producing, amid its gloomy solitude,
that magic gold in which the crucibles of the former were
wanting. It was only in case of some grand exigency,
some claim of unwonted magnitude, or the appeal of some

165
powerful constituent having advice to ask as well as
money to deposit, that the head-clerk presumed to knock
at the door of this sanctum, with an inquiry whether
“Mr. Hamlyn was disengaged ?".
On the day, for instance, when Colonel Hamilton and
Doctor Markham were bowling away, as merrily as four
horses could carry them, across Northamptonshire towards
Cambridge, a modest “May I speak to you, if you please,
sir, for a moment ?” had enabled Spilsby, the bald-headed
chief-clerk, to usher into the consulting-room one of their
clients, Dr. Grantham, an eminent physician, whose prac-
tice of ten thousand per annum placed him, in the opinion
of the firm, on a level with Boerhaave or Galen.
“I am intruding, I fear ?" said he, addressing Ham-
lyn, who rose to press him affectionately by the hand.
But I want, my dear sir, to ask a word of friendly
advice. We doctors," continued he, with a smile," are
accused of making quick work with patients who ask us
for a bit of friendly advice. But with you, I dare my
fate.”
“Pray sit down!" exclaimed Hamlyn, pushing forward
the least uneasy of two uncomfortable arm-chairs. “How
is Mrs. Grantham ?”
“ As well as the anxious mother of twelve children can
ever pretend to be. I have brought you, not my week's
fees to carry to account, but a lump of money for invest-
ment; a lump of money, the possession of which one of
my driblet-earning calling ought, perhaps, to explain, lest
he be suspected of having taken earnest for the despatch
of a bishop or cabinet minister. “ The truth is, my dear
sir, these ten thousand pounds comprehend the whole of
my scrapings together till I was two-and-forty; when I
sold them out of the five per cents. (for there were five
per cents. on the earth in those days !) for a very sacred
purpose. My brother, Dick Grantham, had an opportu-
nity of purchasing a prothonotaryship, without a guinea
in the world for the purpose; and an insurance on his
life and his promise to repay me in ten years, determined
me to risk what then constituted the sole provision for
my children. You don't know my brother Dick, I fancy?
The finest fellow breathing;-the soul of a king, sir! I

could hardly prevail on him to take the money, for he
knew its importance to my family. However, through
my solicitors, I got the business settled without his know-
ledge; and the consequence was, that Dick married and
settled, and became the happiest man on earth. Last week,
sir, (a year within the term prescribed,) my ten thousand
pounds were paid over to the hands of my men of busi-
ness, who suggest a mortgage, by way of investment ;
and have got one, to the tune of six per cent. on the estate
of an Irish Earl. But I don't like mortgages,-least of
all on the estates of Irish Earls,—and so have come to
ask your advice.”
During this apostrophe, an ordinary observer would
have seen nothing in Richard Hamlyn but the attentive,
courteous banker, wishing his client to be a little more
sparing of family details, (time being money, as poor
Richard says) but prepared to give his grave and disin-
terested verdict. A more discerning eye would have dis-
covered, in the recesses of his deep-set eyes, varying
indications of triumph, rapacity, and mistrust. The
banker evidently hated to hear of moneys being paid over
to any man of business but a banker ; just as Dr. Gran-
tham would have been indignant had Hamlyn talked of
consulting Keate or Brodie about a child sick of the
measles.
“I dare say you fancy," resumed Dr. Grantham, attri-
buting his silence and hesitation to unconcern, you,
with your millionary, Rothschildish, stock-exchange ideas,
that the disposal of a little fleabite like these ten thousand
pounds ought not to disturb my night's rest, or spoil my
appetite for my roast mutton. But let me tell you, my
dear Hamlyn, that we poor fellows who pick up our
guineas as pigeons’-peas, one at a time, instead of accom-

I'm in the receipt of a noble income. But I and it may

In short, my
grave.
dear sir, I am not so well off but
that these ten thousand constitute a vital object to my
bantlings. What do you advise me to do? Government
securities ? East India bonds? Railway Shares ? WHAT?”
If
you will give me leave, I will think it over,” re-
plied the banker, unknitting the brows which had assumed
an aspect of cogitation. "These kind of investments de-
pend, in a great measure, on the position of the parties;
whether a small steady certain income be the object, or
sure eventual profit of larger amount. I was offered the
other day, on my private account, a sleeping partnership
in one of the most lucrative concerns in the city. My
responsibilities as a banker forbidding me to involve my-
self in any speculation which might by possibility affect
the interests of the firm, I could not entertain the pro-
posal ; concerning which I am, at present, bound to
secrecy. But I will consult the parties; and should they
sanction me in extending the offer to a friend, believe me,
my dear Grantham, few things in this world would afford
me sincerer pleasure than to prove the means of obtain-
ing so good a thing for a man I so truly value as your-
self. The investment would secure a provision for two
of your sons hereafter, by a share in-but I fear I must
say no more! Be assured only, that I shall regard and
cater for your interest, as I would for my own. I need
not tell you that I am a family-man, and able to sym-
pathize with the father of a family."
“My dear Hanlyn,” cried the Doctor, extending his
hand, (which he was rarely in the habit of doing, unless
for the purpose of feeling a pulse or taking a fee!), “how
shall I thank you for entering so readily into my views?"
“ Not another word. Wait till I have made good my
promises," replied the banker. “You had best leave the
money with us.
We can let you have exchequer-bills
for it, if you think proper."
Scarcely worth while, as a more durable investment
is so shortly to be made!” replied the Doctor, producing
from his pocket-book ten fair-complexioned notes, for
One Thousand each ; which he had just received at Coutts's
in exchange for the cheque of his solicitors.
“I will give you a simple receipt, then, and ask the

favour of you to look in on Saturday,” said Hamlyn,
taking from the desk before him a file of paper-forms, one
of which he filled up with an acknowledgment for ten
thousand pounds, and signed in the name of Hamlyn
and Co.
“A thousand thanks," cried the Doctor, as grateful as
though he were accepting, instead of conferring an obli-
gation. “On Saturday, then!" continued he, taking his
consultation-book from his pocket, and inscribing the
date among his professional visits ;“ on Saturday at three."
To a man so eminent as Grantham, it was indispensable
to do the honours of the house." Pray let me see whether
your carriage is in waiting!" said Hamlyn. And in spite
of his visitor's prohibitions, he escorted him through the
banking-house; more than one of the clerks squinting
upwards from his laborious ink-letting, to examine the
outward man of the client honoured by the personal at-
tentions of the head of the firm. A girl with a shabby
shawl pinned over her shabbier gown, and a porter with
a knot on his head, both of whom were staring away their
impatience in the background, with small cheques to be
cashed after their betters had been served, stood respect-
fully aside for the passage of the spruce, comely, well-fed
gentlemen.
“Mr. 'amlyn, I b'lieve, sir. Please, sir, I'd be glad of
a few minutes with you," said a decently-dressed woman
in black, intercepting the passage of the banker, on his
return through the counting-house to his private room,
after parting with the Doctor.
"My clerk, ma'am, will attend to you instantly. Here!
Spilsby," cried Mr. Hamlyn, beckoning over the counter
the bald-headed clerk, who was at that moment assisting
the cashier in the payment of cheques ; trying, as he spoke,
to escape from her detaining hand.
“I'd rather a deal, sir, with your leave, settle with one
o' the partners,” persisted the woman. And something
in the wilfulness of her appeal instantly relieved the ex-
perienced banker from an apprehension inspired at the
first glance by her mourning suit and withered face, that
he was about to be bothered with the dolefuls of a widow
with one of those prodigious families of orphans, which

newspaper advertisements are constantly providing in
their largest capitals, for the tender mercies of “The
HUMANE WHOM HEAVEN HAS BLESSED WITH AFFLU-
ENCE.”
“Be good enough to step this way, madam,” said he,
his countenance relaxing from its sudden contraction;
and releasing Spilsby by a nod, he opened the door of the
Blue Chamber, which his companion seemed scarcely less
awe-struck at entering, than if it were the royal closet.
“ You remember me now, sir, I dare say? 'Jane Dar-
ley, sir!" said she; hesitating about taking the offered
chair, and fumbling with her cloak, as though her hands
were kneading her courage; “widder of John Darley,
sir, as kept the tap o' Lemon-Tree Yard," she continued,
seeing that the stony-faced banker made no sign of re-
cognition; “ John Darley, sir, as banked with you, and
the good gentleman your father as was, afore you."
Richard Hamlyn bowed thankfully, as expected; having
been long aware that people of Jane Darley's class, who
have ever deposited a hundred pounds in the hands of a
banker, consider themselves, thenceforward, main props
of the solidity of the firm.
“I was sure you'd recollect, sir, when you was once
put upon rememb’ring !" resumed the widow, with grow-
ing confidence; “'cause you an't likely to have forgot the
four hundred pouns, sir, you sold out for me when I had
to set up my son Tummas in business.”
Again the banker bowed, though less thankfully.
o Which was the reason, sir, I axed particular to see
yourself, instead of leaving matters of such consequence
to the young gentlemen I spuk to without. John Darley,
sir, if you remember, left me his hegs-ekitrix, and a deal
of trouble it's been to me, with the debts to call in, many
on 'em bad uns, I'm sorry to say, besides the tap t'
attend to-
“I rather think, madam,” interrupted Hamlyn, “ that
my clerk, Mr. Spilsby, has made your affairs his especial
consideration. He is, therefore, perhaps better qualified
to-
"I ax your pardon, sir," replied the widow Darley,
again driven to the resource of fumbling her cloak for a

For when I wanted to give him the four ’undred poun,

“ To buy into the funds," amended the banker, in a low
voice.
“ He wanted to give me a receipt, sir, all as one as if
I was paying a debt; which, as you know, sir, neither
John Darley nor me was ever a farden beholden to the
firm," continued the widow, with an air of injured dignity.
“ You wish, in short, that we should purchase for you
the value of four hundred pounds, in consols ?" demanded
Hamlyn, coming to the point. “In the name of Jane
Darley, widow, I presume?"
Yes, sir; in the name of Jane Darley, widder, sir, of
Lemon-Tree Yard. For I still keep the tap, sir. After
poor John Darley was taken away, sir, I found myself

you said, madam ?” persisted the banker.

“ Just in order to show you, sir, whereabouts my stock
lies, that they may all be lumped together. For I've a
hard matter, as it is, sir, to make out the queer ways of

A lone woman, sir, is sure to be put upon, in places like
the stocks. And as I'm not in circumstances to employ
an attorney for every trifle, I w"
“If it were agreeable to you, madam, we should be
most happy to relieve you of the trouble," observed Mr.
Hamlyn, gravely. “ Your dividends may be received
with those of the house; and either carried to your ac-
count, or paid over to you, as most agreeable.”
“I'm sure, Mr. 'amlyn, you're most kind and con-
sid'rate, sir," replied the widow Darley, her nervous
twitchings of the cloak subsiding into a series of grateful
curtsies; “ and I return you many thanks, sir. John
Darley always used to say, sir, poor feller, that your bank
was as safe as the Bank of England. And, God knows,
'tis a deal civiller. There, they snap one up as if one

own.
“If
you will intrust these papers to me, madam, I will
take care to have a power of attorney drawn out, and for-
warded to you for signature," said Hamlyn, with the most
conciliating blandness.
“I return you many thanks, sir. I'm sure, sir, when
I come to you about buying out the four ’undred

when I set up poor Tummas in the Borough, sir, (as tal-
low-chandler, sir, and a very comfortable bus’ness he's
made of it,) I little thought I should get my money back
again, out of the fire, as a body may say. However,
please God, I did my duty to him, as John Darley's
hegs-heketricks; and
Four hundred pounds !" said Mr. Hamlyn in a sono-
rous business-like voice, after having counted over eighty
crumpled, greasy, five-pound notes, conveying both to the
smell and touch indications of their transit through the
hands of Thomas Darley, the Borough tallow-chandler.
My clerk will wait upon you, to-morrow morning, in
Lemon-Tree Yard.”
“And with that, my dear Mrs. Snaggs,” said the
widow Darley, (when relating the scene, an hour after-
wards, over a tumbler of brandy-and-water, in the dark
cupboard denominated a back-parlour by her friend and
neighbour, Mrs. Snaggs, the corn-chandler's wife of the
Lemon-Tree stable-yard,) “with that, my dear, he waited
upon me to the door, with the look of a lord, and yet so
affable and so brotherly-like, as if 'twas a pleasure to him
to do a service to the widder and fatherless! And so
you see, Mrs. Snaggs, I'm to be spared the trouble of
rigging myself out twice a-year, and omnibus fares, and
what not, to go bobbing up and down them bank-offices,

clerk axing me at last (after looking at my papers)
whether my name was Jane Darley—as if 'twas like to
be anything else !—And all’s to be done for me as if I
was a lady in the land !"
“And a mint of money you'll be charged for the doing
on it!" muttered Mrs. Snaggs.
“Not I! Leave me alone, Mrs. Snaggs, to take care

CHAPTER XI.
"Why did I change my college life,"
He cries—"for benefice and wife?"-LLOYD.
On the day appointed for Colonel Hamilton's excursion
to Cambridge, the travellers set forth with the spirits of
boys of fifteen, rather than of threescore. They were
the very men to take delight, like Dr. Johnson, in being
whirled along a good road in an easy chaise ; and still
greater, in chirrupping away the evening at a crack inn,
over a roaring fire, amid the ringing of bells, the scuffling
of waiters, the rattle of night-coaches, and the fumes of
port-wine negus and brandy punch.
With Dr. Markham, the expedition amounted to a
party of pleasure. For the good Vicar had not lost sight
of his fireside half-a-dozen times in as many years; and
though somewhat formalized in deportment by the
gravity of his functions, or by having officiated as a
college tutor during the early part of his life, was almost
as genial of temper and temperament as the old Colonel.
Many were the merry anecdotes mutually confided of
a subaltern's life in the East, and a sizar's pariaship at

173
home, which enlivened the fireside of “the best inn's
best room," in the good town of Northampton, where
they stopped for the night; and Dr. Markham retired to
rest, almost ashamed to reflect in how different a mood
of mind he was about to re-enter Cambridge from that
in which he had departed, with his bride, nine years
before, to take possession of his college living. The
worthy man did not, of course, perceive that he was by
no means the worse Christian for being somewhat less
of a prig
On the morrow, they were off early; intending to arrive
for an hour's daylight before dinner-time, that Colonel
Hamilton might engage his young friend to join them at
the Hoop.
“A queer fancy of this lad of Hamlyn's !” said the
Colonel, after settling himself in a comfortable corner of
his easy chariot. “A very queer fancy, to spend his last
vacation scampering over Italy, and this one at Cam-
bridge, with such a home as Dean Park open-armed to
receive him!”
“ He is reading hard for his degree,” replied the
Doctor; "and may find it necessary to repair the idle-
ness produced by his summer's pleasures.'
“But with Henry Hamlyn's talents, Doctor, he might
have been pretty sure of passing ?”
“Not, however, of attaining the high honours ex-
pected of him.”
“But why must he attain high honours ?- What's the
use on't?-He don't pretend to a Mitre or the Wool-
sack; and what the plague a better banker will he make
for university distinctions ?"
A man is never the worse thought of in public or
private life for having proved himself a first-rate scholar,".
replied the Vicar. “Look at Macaulay, -look at Canning,
look at
“At present I only want to look at Henry Hamlyn,
my dear Doctor!" interrupted Colonel Hamilton; "and
I see as plain as a pike-staff that all these classics and
metaphysics have served to put him sadly out of conceit
of Cocker's Arithmetic!-Is there common sense in it, I
only ask you, for a young fellow to give up five or six of

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
the best years of his life to the acquirement of two lan-
guages talked nowhere on the face of the globe, the
works in which are all translated into good sensible
English? To my thinking, since they're called the dead
languages, they would be just as well buried and put out
of the way!
“Amen" would have stuck in the throat of the
dissentient D.D. But on venturing a word or two con-
cerning the importance of classical scholarship to the
civilization of society, he was speedily interrupted.
“Don't tell me," cried the Colonel." “If your law-
makers or gospel-teachers require Plato and Horace to
help 'em in their bus’ness, --what becomes of Chris-
tianity? The Bible, sir, and Algebra are ballast
enough for any man's understanding. Look at me,
Doctor!-As there was no Haileybury, in my boyhood,
by way of preparation for Indy, I was dunced over
Greek" and Latin at the Charter-House, from ten till
fifteen; and from that day to this, have never opened
a classic. Fortunately, I happened to have what is
called a turn for mechanics ;-(as my family might
have found out from my having managed to manu-
factur' a red-cap's draw-bucket afore I was breeched !)
So on reaching Bombay, full of strength and full of
courage, I set my shoulder to the wheel, and studied at
the College there, till I made some figure in the engineer-
ing department. Once employed, sir, I'd the luck to
invent a caisson for a lock, on the Military Canal at
Chinderapore, where I was stationed; and so my fortune
was made.-And now pray tell me, what would all the
Homer and Horace in the world have done to help me ?-
Whereas, if I'd gone out to Indy a first-rate mathema-
tician,-a first-rate civil engineer-
“We rather pique ourselves at Cambridge on our
mathematical proficiency !" slily rejoined the Doctor.
“However, to return to the present pursuits of young
Mr. Hamlyn, I fancy that, being less pampered by his
father than bis handsome elder brother, Henry may find
college-life a pleasanter thing than the formality of
Cavendish Square or seclusion of Dean Park. You don't
know what an exciting existence is that of a young man

175
distinguished in the University, and endowed with Henry
Hamlyn's means, worldly and intellectual !"
And forthwith the good Doctor began to enlarge
anew, as though he had never before touched
upon
the
subject, on the pleasures of college cheer,-college
honours,-college sociality,--the ale, milk-punch, and
aristocratic “winings” of Trin. Coll.—which, having
the usual influence of a thrice-told tale, the sonorous
breathings of Hamilton, in his cozy corner, (as if keeping
cadence to the rising of the postboys in their stirrups,)
soon announced that he was happy in the land of
dreams.
While enjoying himself in that aërial region, an un-
lucky change came over the face of the earth. A drizzly
rain began to beat against the carriage-windows; and
when the Colonel commenced rubbing his eyes, on being
jogged by his companion, as they entered the High
Street of Cambridge, there was unquestionably nothing
in the scene to justify the excitement and exultation
beaming in the looks of the D.D. The plashy pavement
and streaming kennels of a dingy, tortuous street, along
which a few draggle-suited collegians were straggling
through the mists of a rainy evening, amid half-lighted
shops whose twinklings were scarcely discernible through
the dim windows, imparted no enlivenment to a spot, the
quaint antiquities of which require fresh air and broad
daylight to assume their more imposing dignity in the
eyes of the stranger.
By George, Doctor! you deserve to have lived and
died the Fellow of a College, if you compare this close
fusty town with the open pastures of Dean Park !"
cried Colonel Hamilton, as the carriage bowled onwards
to the Hoop; where the jingling bell called forth the
alacrity of landlord and waiters, to do homage to the
proprietor of so handsome a carriage; some old gentle-
man of fortune, doubtless, come to. matriculate his son
and heir, under the instructions of the reverend private
tutor, his companion.
Either his nap or the rainy afternoon had operated un-
favourably on his spirits; for Colonel Hamilton began,
on the very threshold, to institute unfavourable com-
66

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
parisons with the comfortable, wholesome, country-inn of
the day before.
Ushered into a parlour scented with spirits and
tobacco, so as to resemble the mess-room of a marching
regiment far more than was compatible with the decorum
of Alma Mater, the Colonel was pursued by a head-
waiter, who stirred up the already roaring fire till it
emulated the blast-furnace of a foundry; while several
subordinates followed, with officious zeal, bustling in the
chaise-seats and dressing-boxes they knew must be
instantly removed into the bed-rooms, before Johnston,
who was paying the postboys, could prevent their inter-
ference.
While Colonel Hamilton stood as near the hearthrug
as the tremendous fire of glowing cinders would allow,
wondering when the exit of these troublesome bustlers
would admit of shutting the door to the exclusion of the
damp draught of evening air, the obsequious host made
his appearance, bearing in his hand a strip of paper half-
a-yard long, which, to any but a new comer, would have
assumed an alarming aspect.
“Will you please to order dinner, sir?” said he, with
the deference due to a traveller with four horses, and an
sown man" of Johnston's personal dignity.
“ Can you tell me, pray, whether Mr. Hamlyn of
Trinity is in college ?" inquired the Colonel in his
turn.
“No, sir, I cannot, sir. Will you be pleased to order
dinner, sir?"-persisted the host, equally intent upon
his object of the moment.
“I will thank you to inquire," said Colonel Hamilton,
accepting the offered protocol as his best chance of
obtaining attention.
“John, inquire whether a Mr. Humbling's in college,
said the host, addressing his head-waiter; who, having in
his turn commissioned a Boots, or one of the “
bodies" always hanging about an inn-yard, was despatched
in search of information which nobody was interested to
impart; while the eye of Colonel Hamilton wandered
vacantly over the strip of paper in his hand, a catalogue
of all the soups included in Mrs. Rundell's Domestic
some-

Cookery; all the fishes of the sea, and all the fowls of
the poultry-yard.
Insufficiently versed in the mendaciousness of such
manifestoes to know that the “ turbot” would make its
appearance in the shape of a brill, and the gravy soup as
washy broth with a dogger-bank of black pepper at tho
bottom, Colonel Hamilton issued orders for as good a.
dinner as the yard of foolscap before him undertook to
supply; and having so far benefited by the measure ap
to rid himself of the presence of a gentleman who
resembled one of his own porter-butts dressed by an
advertising clothes-warehouse, waited patiently the return
of his messenger.
Still, no answer! The intelligence that “No Mr.
Humbling was known in Trinity" not being likely to add
an item to the bill, was withheld in order to be brought
in by the landlord with the soyp-tureen; nor was it till
after repeated rings at the bell, and the despatch of as
many messengers as issue per diem from Downing Street
during the Session of Parliament, that an intelligible
answer was at length delivered to Colonel Hamilton, to
the effect, that “Mr. Henry Hamlyn, of Trinity, was not
in College, having quitted Cambridge, for London, some
days before."
So, so, so! cried Colonel Hamilton. " This is the
way these youngsters impose upon the old fogeys. This
admirable Crichton, who fancies himself too learned for
a banker, and persuades his poor fond foolish mother and
sister that he's sapping his brains out at Trinity, is most
likely at this moment lounging on the Chain Pier at
Brighton, or resolving the problems of the Christmas
Pantomime!--A pretty couple o' blockheads wę look, like,
Doctor, to have come so far on, a fool's errand !”

Pray do not include me, my dear sir, in any such
category !" cried Dr. Markham, good-humouredly. My
object will be fully answered in a pleasant journey and a
peep at the old spot where, before I became the happiest
husband in England, I was the most contented old
bachelor. After a cheerful dinner and glass of wine
with you, I shall beat up the quarters of a few old
college chums who still stick to their fellowships; and

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
I can thus afford latitude for my young friend's vacation
rambles.”
Colonel Hamilton, however, deeply impressed by the
importance of his interposition, at such a crisis, to the
happiness of the Hamlyn family, though cautious of
owning the nature of his uneasiness, could not altogether
conceal from his companion his vexation and disappoint-
ment. Already, Dr. Markham had resolved to abstain
from his threatened visit to St. John's, that the old
gentleman might be comforted by his usual game at
backgammon.
“ I tell ye what, Doctor !" cried the Colonel, when the
waiters had relieved the travellers of their presence,—" if
it didn't
very much signify to you, now you've got your
furlough, where you spent your leave-of-absence, I'd ask
the favour of you to accompany me to-morrow to town.
I've a vast mind for an interview with this boy, afore
I'm a week older. After a day or two in Lon'on, we'll
back to Ovington, and surprise the good lady at the
Vicarage with an account of our scapegrace exploit."
“With all my heart, with all my heart!" replied Dr.
Markham, readily conceiving that these precipitate move-
ments had a more serious motive than the old gentleman
was at liberty to avow. “I am prepared, like a faithful
esquire, to follow the wanderings of my liege knight; on
condition, however, that you take a glance at King's
College Chapel, and allow me one at my old shop, to-
morrow, before we get into the carriage.'
So reasonable a request was, of course, cheerfully
acceded to; and at an earlier hour than the head-waiter
judged it by any means becoming for“ gents as travelled
with four" to be astir, Markham was approaching the
gober-suited home of his bachelorhood, preparatory to
escorting the Colonel to Trinity Chapel.
To Dr. Markham, it was like pressing the hand of an
old friend to pass under the venerable gateway of St.
John's; and on raising his eyes towards the narrow
windows of the old rooms through which, during sixteen
years of his life, he had gazed, day after day, on that un-
eventful quadrangle, the contrast afforded by the lonely
gloom of the spot to his own happy, affectionate, in-

dependent home, excited such feelings of thankfulness in
the heart of the good Vicar, that he was almost glad to
be secure from encounter with his college friends, while
his eyes were still so moist.
The sound of the long familiar bells recalled thronging
thoughts and half-effaced aspirations. Echoes, long
silent, were awakened in the depths of his heart. He
seemed to live over again the days when bis hopes of
happiness were comprised in a modest home, over which
a certain gentle Cousin Kitty was to preside, and become
the mother of the olive-branches round about his table.
And pious was the gratitude of the good Vicar when
he reflected that the home, and the Cousin Kitty, and
the olive-branches, had been fully vouchsafed him; the
prospects of his children, as well as the welfare of their
parents, being secured, under the will of Providence, by
the zealous aid of his friend, Hamlyn the banker.
Still overflowing with thankfulness were the good
man's feelings, when he rejoined Colonel Hamilton;
who, having recovered, in a good night's rest, bis dis-
appointment at Henry Hamlyn's absence, was quite as
ready to admire and praise, as the most enthusiastic of
Cantabs could desire.
“ By George! I begin to feel ashamed of the treasons
I uttered yesterday ! cried he.

For I recant my anti-classical heresies. In this

bustle o' business and whirl о' pleasure,--one comes to
fancy the gravity of philosophy, gammon. Here, it

said he, “in proof hereafter of the reality of my visit,"

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
And having ascertained that, during their absence,
Johnston was to settle the Hoop account, and see the
horses put-to, Dr. Markham, well acquainted with young
Hamlyn's college tutor, obtained such credentials as
opened the door of his rooms. From the same respectable
source, the friends of the truant were supplied, unasked,
with an earnest tribute to his merits. They had the
satisfaction of hearing that, with the highest distinctions
of the university, young Hamlyn conciliated a larger
share of its affections than is usually accorded to the pet
of the bigwigs.
“Hamlyn is a general favourite,” said Dr. Markham's
learned friend ; “ so general, that I almost wonder at the
perseverance of his application. Even at Cambridge, as
Erasmus has it—Non desunt crassi quidem qui studiosos
à libris deterreant ;' and I sometimes fear the best head
in Trinity may come, like the thickest, to be broken by
a tandem. By-and-bye, when his imagination is sobered,
and his enthusiasm tamed down into practical views, it
will
go hard but we hear of Hamlyn as one of the distin-
guished men of his time. He has been a little overset
by his foreign excursion. I never know what to make
of my young men, when they come back with their brains
turned by Switzerland or the Rhine. But the brief mad-
ness usually flies off in the fumes of an ode or two. They
rhyme themselves sober again.”
After this indication to the leading foible of their young
friend, it did not surprise the Vicar or Colonel Hamilton,
on being admitted by the gyp into his rooms, to find
them, in addition to their simple, solid furniture, adorned
with some admirable sketches of the Abruzzi, bearing the
initials of H. H., and a selection from the fine engravings
of Raphael Morghen after the chef-d'æuvres of the
ancient masters, in place of the portraits of actresses.
and opera-dancers, constituting the usual embellishment
of a young man's lodgings.
On a bracket between the windows, stood the cast of a
splendid original bust by Gibson ;-a female head,--pur-
porting, as announced by the crescent on its brows, to
represent the severe beauty of the “Queen and huntress,
chaste and fair,” of Ben Jonson. On the table stood a

china flower-pot, containing what, at first sight, Dr. Mark-
ham pronounced to be a stump of black-lead pencil, so
slight was the trace of foliage confirming the assurance of
the gyp that it was a myrtle-tree, brought with great
care and trouble by Mr. Hamlyn from some famous place
in foreign parts, which he had strict orders to water care-
fully during his absence.
“A sprig from Virgil's tomb, or the Grotto of Egeria,
I'll be bound !” cried the Colonel, with a hearty laugh.
“Doctor, Doctor, why don't you perform your salam to
so classical a relic? Ten to one, the poor lad has got a
sonnet to't in his note-book; and expects his verses and
stunted laurels to flourish together. But God be gra-
cious to me, what have we here!” cried he, a moment
afterwards, congratulating himself that his rash exclama-
tion had probably been unheard by the Vicar, who was
staring his eyes out at Henry's fine sketch of the ruins
of Tusculum, classically explained by the gyp watching
over his shoulder, to be “Tullus's Willow at Room."
The letter, a single glance at which had extorted so
vehement an ejaculation from Colonel Hamilton, was
lying unopened on Henry Hamlyn's desk; accompanied
by a note or two, and a slip of paper having the appear-
ance of a bill,—all of which had evidently arrived during
his absence.
With a degree of indiscretion, pardonable or unpar-
donable, who shall decide ? Colonel Hamilton, perceiving
that the Doctor was thoroughly absorbed by a splendid
print of the Transfiguration which constituted the
master-work of the Hamlyn gallery, raised it from the
desk, and deliberately examined the superscription and
seal, the paper and post-mark; forming inferences, per-
haps, from its thickness and complexion, of the length
and nature of the epistle. Nay, after laying it down, as
if he had satisfied himself fully on these points, such was
the old gentleman's pertinacious interest in the corre-
spondence of the young graduate of Trinity, that he
actually took it a second time from the desk; and, after
a renewed and still more careful examination, replaced it
on the table.
“ Of all the strange things I ever knew in this world,

this is the strangest !” muttered he, when, after a liberal
gratuity to the gyp, and a request that, on Mr. Hamlyn's
arrival, the visit of Colonel Hamilton and Dr. Markham
might be announced to him, they quitted the rooms; nor
could the utmost endeavours of Dr. Markham to revive
his previous enthusiasm while proceeding through a
hurried visit to King's College and Downing, obtain more
than monosyllables from the Colonel.
Dr. Markham was luckily too much absorbed by the
numberless interests and associations reviving every mo-
ment around him, to take heed of his absence of mind;
and the carriage which they hurriedly entered, under the
gateway of the Hoop, reached the Trumpington turnpike
ere a syllable escaped his lips.
" By George! the strangest thing in the world !" were
fated to be his "few last words” in Cambridge.

CHAPTER XII.
“Good-nature has an endless source of pleasure in it; and the representation of
domestic life filled with its natural gratifications (instead of the vexations generally
insisted upon in the writings of the witty) will be a very good office to society. It
would be a lamentable thing that a man must be a philosopher to know how to
pass away his time agreeably.”-STEELE.
“I was determined to take you by surprise, my dear
Hamlyn,” cried Colonel Hamilton, as, following close the
footman who announced him, and followed closely in his
turn by Dr. Markham, he entered the drawing-room in
Cavendish Square, that evening, at what he supposed to
be a late hour for tea.
But if he had calculated on seeing an expression of joy-
ful astonishment in the countenance of the banker, he was
undeceived. After a stammered greeting to two such un-
expected visitors, nothing remained apparent in Hamlyn's
face but an air of embarrassment.
The tea-tray had been already removed; and, on their
arrival, Hamlyn was seated in his slippers, in all the dig-
array of domestic ease, beside a writing-table, covered
with papers, amid which stood a reflecting lamp. The

banker, occupied in some important calculation, probably
wished them back at Ovington, or anywhere else, a hun-
dred miles from Cavendish Square.
“Whom did you expect to find with me, my dear
Colonel, that you appear so astonished at my being
alone ?” said Hamlyn, endeavouring to rally his spirits.
“So long as my family remains at Dean, I am quite as
solitary in town as you at Burlington. Between the
sporting turn of Walter, and the stuodius turn of Harry,
I am as much left to myself as though I had not a son to
call my own!”
Luckily, the Colonel had forewarned Dr. Markham
that, on account of a disagreement in the Hamlyn family,
no allusion must be made to his purposed visit to Henry
Hamlyn.
"Im not fond of mysteries and concealments, my dear
Doctor!" said he. “But between ourselves, we must
say nothing at present of our little trip to Cambridge.
Luckily, Hamlyn is not given to asking idle questions,
like that burly baronet of a brother-in-law at The Hyde.
He'll take our journey as a matter of course ; for I told
him afore he left Warwickshire, I must be up in town
shortly, to look out for my daughter-in-law's arrival.—So
not a syllable in allusion to poor Harry!”
This prohibition having been enforced anew by a sig-
nificant look, on learning from Hamlyn that his son was
“reading hard at Cambridge," the Vicar was not a little
amused at the bungling efforts made by so poor a dis-
sembler as the Colonel, to conceal that they had reached
London by the northern, instead of the western road.
Still, Colonel Hamilton might have blundered and blun-
dered on, without attracting the notice of his companion.
For the greater the efforts of Hamlyn to talk chattily and
do the honours of the tea-table, already replenished, the
plainer it became, from sundry glances at his writing-
table, that his mind was reverting to the occupation from
which he had been disturbed by his friends.
“ I conclude you have not yet had time since your
arrival,” observed the host, with a vagueness of eye that
must have struck a shrewder man than Hamilton, “to
make inquiries concerning Mrs. Robert's arrival ?”

"Faith, I scarcely know where to make 'em, till I
obtain the information from you,” replied the Colonel.
“I thought you were in close correspondence. I have
had no communication with her (except the formal noting
and payment of her jointure through the banking-house)
for the last two years.'
“I know it, I know it! But I fancied you might be
able to tell me to what London hotel Lady Burlington
was in the habit of resorting. They've been travelling
together, in Italy. When Ellen came down to visit you
at Dean Park, my dear Hamlyn, she made acquaintance,
it seems, with Lady Burlington; and meeting together
thus strangely in a foreign country,-already widows, and
as it were in exile,-they nat'rally struck up a friendship,
poor things !"
Mr. Hamlyn appeared disagreeably startled by this
explanation.
*It is therefore more than probable," pursued. the
Colonel," that Ellen, who knows little or nothing of
Lon'on, will profit by her friend's experience in the choice
of an hotel.”
“Likely enough," observed Dr. Markham, seeing that
Hamlyn was unprepared to reply. “And Lady Burling-
ton, if I remember, always went to Mivart's. In Sir
Roger's time, I remember seeing them start from thence,
one morning, for Ascot races.”
“It is a most extraordinary thing that he should never
have mentioned to me having made her acquaintance!"
said Hamlyn, after some minutes' silence, as if musing
aloud.
“Who?–Markham - Why, surely you must have
known the acquaintance that subsisted between Ovington
Vicarage and Burlington Manor ?” cried Colonel Hamil-
ton, becoming alive to the absent, hurried manner of his
friend.
""IMI was talking of-
“I think you scarcely know what you're talking of, my
dear old friend!” cried the Colonel, slapping him on the
back. “Were you o' Watty's age, I should fancy you
were over head and ears in love!"
“I was talking of my son Henry and your daughter.

as-
in-law," said Hamlyn, thinking it more prudent to speak
out." I was expressing my surprise that my son should
never have alluded to having met Mrs. Robert Hamilton
in Italy."
And how the plague d'ye know they did meet ?"
cried the Colonel, on this point almost as curious as his
friend.
“Because Henry spent the greater part of his time in
company with Lady Burlington. He brought me letters
from her, and papers of consequence. But though, ere
he hurried back to Cambridge, he spent a day with me
here in town, alone, and freely discussing all the occur-
rences of his tour, he never made the remotest allusion
to a person so interesting to the feelings of us all as-
-Mrs. Robert Hamilton.”
“There's no accounting for the mysteries of young
folks, or what they may or may not think worth mention-
ing. As Harry knew you'd not, in the first instance,
shown yourself partial to my poor daughter-in-law, he
"might fancy you did not care to hear of her intimacy
with
your friend Lady Burlington; or, maybe, to hear
of her at all.”
“Still, a person so beautiful and accomplished as Mrs.
Robert, must have attracted great attention abroad; and
it would have been only natural to say how he found her
looking."
“She is strikingly beautiful, eh?” cried Hamilton.
" How the deuce, then, came you to be always so indig-
nant at what you called Bob's infatuation ?”
“I might think her singularly lovely, yet an imprudent
match for a young man of Robert's brilliant prospects."
“You're queer fishes, -vastly queer fishes, - you
money-spinners!” cried Colonel Hamilton, almost pet-
tishly. “ You seem to think there's nothing better to
be bought with money, than money! What the plague
could my poor boy get better, in exchange for his heir-
ship to fifteen thousand a-year, than a pretty young wife?
However, we won't fight that battle over again-the only
point ever in dispute betwixt us.
And since you say
Mivart's is the place, we'll go and look after Ellen to-
morrow morning, Doctor, if you've no objection."

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
After a few inquiries on Hamilton's part about the
party at Rotherwood Castle, and the health of the Mar-
chioness of Dartford, purporting to change the conversa-
tion, and a little parish gossip between the banker and
the Vicar, the visitors re-entered their hackney-coach,
and returned to Fenton’s hotel,—to sleep soundly after
three days of exertion so unusual in the even tenor of
their lives.
But the sleep of the banker was fated to be less easy.
His heart was disquieted within him. By nature mistrust-
ful, and his mistrusts aggravated at times to torture by
the consciousness of a load of concealments, new anxieties
had been created in his mind by the sudden discovery of
this unsuspected intimacy between the two women he
liked least on earth.
Richard Hamlyn, whatever else might be his weak-
nesses, had, it must be admitted, little leaning towards
the gentler sex. A harassed, anxious life either inclines
a man to put unlimited trust in women, and derive his
chief solace from their companionship, or to endure them
as an embarrassing incumbrance. Hamlyn had adopted
the latter alternative. Instead of reverencing the meek
submission of his wife, he regarded her as an obstacle
which he had conquered. But Lady Burlington and Mrs.
Robert Hamilton still thwarted his
purposes.
And these
two women he loathed.
Yet the widow of Sir Roger Burlington, young, fair,
gentle, was a singular object for antipathy: Impossible
to see a sweeter, more timid, or more feminine woman.
Infirm of health, still more infirm of purpose, she was
at the disposal of those who chose to be at the trouble
of regulating her movements. But, as the dove in the
exercise of its domestic functions is said to acquire
the ferocity of the eagle, as a wife and mother, a bereaved
wife and anxious mother, Lady Burlington had assumed
courage to defend the interests of her only child from
the arbitrary encroachments of the banker; and Hamlyn
had no patience with the fair, fragile-looking thing in
a widow's cap and weeds, that presumed to have a will
of its own touching the sale of an estate, or paying off of
& mortgage.

second year.
The “beautiful Ellen," meanwhile, was the reverse of
all this; and if, in his soul, he despised the gentle lady
of Burlington Manor, it sank rebuked under the pene-
trating eye of Bob Hamilton's widow. He was afraid of
her. She was the Ellen Somerton he had persecuted, the
Ellen Somerton he had injured; and she was now the
Mrs. Robert Hamilton who might injure and persecute
him in return. He had bruised her head.-She might
still bruise his heel.
For there was the spirit of no ordinary character in
Ellen Hamilton; so for the future let us name the fair
widow, who, even now, had not completed her twenty-
The only child of the widow of a naval
officer of modest connexions, who had bequeathed nothing
besides his small pension for the maintenance of their
child, the rare beauty and still rarer intelligence of the
daughter, served at once to obviate the evils of such a
position, and render them harder to be borne. But Ellen
had high courage and a devoted heart; and, from the
moment she became aware of her
poor
mother's privations,
resolved to work for her independence. But how is a
young girl to achieve “independence ?” As a sempstress,
by which, with assiduous application, she may obtain a
shilling a day?-As a fritterer of fancy articles, the sale
of which (except in novels) is so precarious ? - As a
teacher of music, as a nursery governess ? - Alas! for
these vocations, recommendations must be procured; and
even had they been forthcoming, at sixteen Ellen Somer-
ton was so beautiful, that any duty requiring her transit
through the open street was a service of danger.
Had such charms and qualifications as Ellen Somerton's
existed in combination with birth and fortune, she would
have been pronounced the most beautiful woman of the
day. Her portrait would have figured in exhibitions and
annuals; and the likeness of her finely-developed form
attracted crowds to the print-shop windows. But in
humbler life, such beauty becomes an object of mistrust.
Ellen was too handsome for a governess, too handsome for
a teacher. Again and again, with her mother's sanction,
she had attempted to obtain such an employment. Im-
possible !—The cautious or prudish were afraid to em-

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
barrass themselves with so beautiful an inmate. One
had a brother, -one a son,-one a husband. Not a
woman of them all was to be persuaded !
The
poor
widow and her daughter, too ill off to reside
in the metropolis, had retired to York, where they
boarded in the house of a maiden lady, an infirm relative
of the deceased Captain Somerton; and there, it hap-
pened that the accidental perusal of some dramatic
Memoirs revealing the prodigious fortunes to be acquired
on the English Stage, by the aid of genius and ability,
fell into the hands of the girl who saw her mother lan-
guishing under the pangs of poverty.
“And why should not I, too, be an actress ?” said she,
in the earnestness of her heart, and consciousness of her
genius. “Women have risen to the summit of the profes-
sion without forfeiting the esteem of society. Why may
not I, too, become a Mrs. Siddons,--a Miss O'Neill ?"
Without consulting her mother, whose susceptibility
as an officer's widow would, she knew, rebel against such
a proposition, Ellen Somerton set about studying for the
stage. Already familiar with the spirit of our great dra-
matist, she made herself mistress of the leading parts in
Shakspeare's plays; and Juliet became once more exqui-
sitely revived by the rich tones of her youthful voice, and
the graceful attitudes of one of the finest of forms. All
she awaited for the accomplishment of her project was
the arrival at York of an eminent actress of one of the
winter theatres,-a woman equally esteemed for her re-
spectability in private life, and her talents on the boards,
who was engaged for a few nights' representation on her
way to Edinburgh. To her, Ellen had resolved to apply
for advice and instruction; looking hopefully forward to
the means of independence for herself and competence
for the declining years of her mother; a consideration
sufficient to alleviate all that was painful to her feelings
in the projected sacrifice.
It was at this crisis she became accidentally acquainted
with Robert Hamilton, who was quartered with his
regiment at York. On her way home from the lodgings
of Mrs.
still excited by the impersonation she had
been exhibiting, to the surprise and delight of the practised

London actress, who did not hesitate to predict miracles of
success, she was followed by two officers; nor did her
modest demeanour secure her against the compliments
usually paid, under such circumstances, to a beautiful
girl, emerging, unprotected from the lodgings of an
actress.
Ellen Somerton was sufficiently mistress of herself to
express indignation at this ungentlemanly intrusion; and
young Hamilton, luckily of a turn of mind to be only
further prepossessed by the rebuke of the offended beauty.
With some difficulty, he eventually obtained an introduc-
tion to her mother, and was permitted to visit at the
house. With still greater difficulty, his attachment found
favour in the sight of Ellen; to whose pronounced cha-
racter, his timid nature and extreme youth were grievous
disqualifications. For the rash lover had not yet attained
his majority; and nearly a year must elapse before he
could obtain such a sanction from his father as might
entitle him to demand her hand.
During the lapse of that year, however, the constancy
of Robert Hamilton's attentions, and the gentle submis-
sion with which he accommodated himself to the exactions
of her mother's humble fireside, wrought all the effect he
could have desired upon the proud heart of Ellen. Re-
gardless of the superiority of his position, she became
warmly attached to him; and, when the period ap-
proached for the arrival of Colonel Hamilton's answer to
his son's application, was almost as nervous and anxious
as the devoted lover. -
That answer, however, imposed further suspense. Colo-
nel Hamilton judiciously pronounced that his son was
too
young to know his own mind; and addressed at the
same time a private commission to his correspondent,
Hamlyn the banker, to inquire into the connexions,
situation, and conduct of a certain Mrs. Somerton and
her daughter, the widow of a Captain in the Navy,
residing in reduced circumstances at York, whose daugh-
ter his son was anxious to marry.
By a singular stroke of ill-fortune, the lady to whom
Ellen had applied the preceding year for professional
advice, with a full disclosure of her poverty and plans,

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
conceived herself to be rendering a service to her interest-
ing protégée by announcing, on her return to town, the
existence of a theatrical phoenix in the provinces, who was
likely to restore to the theatres all the fashionable vogue
admitted to have been withdrawn from the time a first-
rate actress was wanting on the boards. The rumours of
what are called the “theatrical circles” have usually their
echoes in the public press; and the consequence was that,
before the project of poor Ellen was developed, even to
her mother, the Sunday papers, whenever in want of a
paragraph for their theatrical articles, indulged in pre-
dictions concerning the unparalleled Juliet,--the new
O'Neill,—the beautiful Miss Somerton of York.
What a discovery for Richard Hamlyn! He who had.
fixed his heart upon keeping single and heirless the only
surviving son of his wealthy client at Ghazerapore,
instead of making the inquiries demanded of him, did
not hesitate to describe the threatened daughter-in-law
as.“ a country actress,-a thing composed of rouge and
rant,--spangles and false ringlets,-the protégée of the
barracks,-an artful baggage who had enthralled the feel
ings of an inexperienced lad of twenty-one !"
No wonder such a picture should rouse even the un-
ready ire of the Colonel. No wonder the mere idea of
such a daughter should produce the angry prohibition, nay,
the threatened malediction, of old John Hamilton! For
the first time in his life, he expressed himself bitterly and
unfairly, in his letter of prohibition.
Long before that letter reached England, the inter-
ference of Robert Hamilton had obtained a public contra--
diction of the announcement of the appearance of the new
Juliet. But the mischief was done. After nearly two
years of suspense, patiently endured by all parties, after
the heroical submission of that humble domestic circle,
came this cruel disappointment!-
The high-minded mother, from whom Ellen and her
plighted lover had concealed the reports in question,
ignorant till that moment of a project frustrated by the
altered prospects of the family, sank under the influence
of Colonel Hamilton's humiliating insinuations. Had
poor Ellen really become an actress, the power of genius,:

191
the meed of public approbation, would probably have
sanctified the calling in the eyes of her mother. But
the stigma was conveyed without its extenuation. The
bane had no assuaging antidote. Ellen, her pure, virtuous,
gifted, dutiful, spotless Ellen, was branded as the “pro-
tégée of the barracks ;" and the poor woman, long harassed
by anxiety, poverty, and care, laid her head on the pillow
of sickness after perusing the bitter letter of Colonel
Hamilton, and never raised it again.--Her next resting-
place was the grave.
By the indiscreet frankness of Colonel Hamilton, the
source of his information had been cited in his letter
his son; and in the bitterness of her bereavement, the
orphan addressed to Richard Hamlyn a letter of remon-
strance; laying before him the sufferings of her mother's
life, the fortitude of her mother's character, the wretched-
ness of her mother's end, and the cruelty of his con-
duct.
She wrote, also, to Colonel Hamilton. In defence of
her own and her mother's character, she placed before
him all the circumstances of her unhappy fortunes; and
even obtained an attestation from the clergyman who
had officiated at her mother's death-bed, and assisted
them for the last fifteen years in their diligent observance
of the duties of the Protestant Church; declaring his
young charge to be not only irreproachable as one of his
own children, but exemplary in all the relations of life.
Till the answer to this communication should arrive,
Ellen steadily declined even a friendly intercourse with
Robert Hamilton, And verily she had her rewa
ward; for
when Colonel Hamilton's reply eventually made its appear-
ance, it was worthy of his humane nature. It conveyed
happiness, comfort, independence; all she could desire,
save wbat was gone for ever,—the tender mother she
had lost,—the broken constitution of her affianced hus-
band.
The good pastor, who had stood the friend of poor
Ellen in her adversity, gave her away; and Robert, who,
from the delicacy of his health, had been forced to quit
the army, proposed that they should pass their first winter
in Italy.

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Happy in themselves, and surrounded by the comforts
secured by the liberality of the good Colonel, they were
preparing for immediate departure, when Robert Hamil-
ton, after due appeal to her indulgence, hazarded an
earnest petition in favour of the repentant banker; who,
in despair at the result of his rash slander and having
risked the displeasure of his valued client, had appealed
forcibly to the feelings of Robert, as his father's friend,
and the kindly fosterer of his boyhood. Conscious of his
approaching end, young Hamilton, desirous to exercise
the last act in his power of Christian forbearance, not
only forgave his enemy, but obtained from the reluctant
Ellen her consent to pass a few days, preparatory to
leaving England, with the banker's family at Dean Park.
Once there, Richard Hamlyn spared no pains to obtain
forgiveness of his fault. Already, he had despatched to
Ghazerapore an assurance of his prompt atonement; and
every word he addressed to Mrs. Robert Hamilton, while
under his roof, was a self-abasement.
But while Ellen recognised with admiration the gentle
virtues of the banker's wife, and in deference to these, sup-
pressed all betrayal of disgust toward the husband, Richard
Hamlyn was conscious that he had effected nothing to-
wards the obliteration of the uncharitable feelings his
malice had created. He saw that, in Ellen Hamilton, he
had an enemy for life : that between him and her, as
regarded the favour of her father-in-law, there would be
perpetual warfare; and when, within a year after his
marriage, tidings reached England from Naples of the
untimely death of the young husband, the banker fore-
saw that his designs upon the inheritance of his friend
the Nabob, though strengthened by the event, might be
baffled by the influence of the beautiful widow.
Her indifference to pecuniary advantage, afforded his
sole solace. On Colonel Hamilton's arrival in England,
his daughter-in-law, so far from hastening to profit by
the offers of a home which he vouchsafed her, kept aloof;
unconscious or careless of her power to become the heiress
of three hundred and forty-two thousand pounds!
On a sudden, however, after the lapse of more than
year, her return to England was announced, at a moment

193
when her presence portended defeat to the plottings of
the banker. Having located himself in peace and quiet-
ness for the remainder of his days, the Colonel, as became
his advanced age, began to talk of making his will; a will
disposing of nearly three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds, –a sum involving the honour and solvency of
Hamlyn and Co.
In the present crisis of his affairs, two things appeared
essential to accomplish the defeated projects of Richard
Hamlyn's careworn life; first, that one of his family
should be ready to succeed him in his business, and be
come the depositary of its mysteries and conservator of
its fortunes; and, secondly, that the property of Colonel
Hamilton should be secured to him as head of the firm.
If his hopes of direct inheritance were frustrated by the.
ill-omened arrival of the widow, her marriage with his
son Walter seemed to present the sole alternative. But
what was to be hoped, if all her former aversion to the
Hamlyn family had been recently renewed, by a sudden
intimacy with Lady Burlington, to whom he knew him-
self to be an object of abhorrence; more especially if,
according to the surmise recently suggested by Colonel
Hamilton, his son Henry had become intimate with this
dangerous pair, and imbibed their sentiments of mistrust.
Richard Hamlyn was a systematic dissembler; one of
those who not only “let not their right hand know what
their left doeth," but in league with his left hand to de-
ceive and defraud his right. His whole life was a system
of careful and consistent deceit. Having once launched
upon the sea of imposture, he was unable to recede from
acts of dissimulation towards his customers and mercan-
tile associates. But a deception in which he persevered
for the gratification of his personal feelings, was the atti-
tude he assumed towards his family. The only thing he
cared for in public life was to be cited as Hamlyn the
banker, son of Hamlyn the banker, head of one of the
most substantial firms in the city. The only thing he
desired in private, was to appear before his sons as the
most upright and honourable of the human race; a con-
scientious man of business, a disinterested politician, a
virtuous citizen, a benevolent Christian, a great and good

man,
He cared as much for this as others more deeply
imbued with a sense of mortal responsibility, others with
a more deepfelt awe of the terrors of eternal punishment,
for the exercise of those virtues of which he ambitioned
the semblance.
Some excuse may be offered for this infatuation. There
is an exquisite charm in filial tenderness, to which many
a nature inaccessible to any other species of human affec-
tion is open at every pore. The love of a young child
for its parents,-the trustful, uninquiring, pious love that
can neither imagine a fault nor resent an injustice,-ap-
proaches nearest to the expansion of adoration we render
to the Supreme Being; and to those who have suffered
under the aspersions of the world, or been wounded by
the scorn of their fellow-creatures, this holy tenderness
conveys a balm devised, as by the express mercy of God,
for the healing of their sorrows. While others' mistrust,
the confiding child has faith, as in the stability of Heaven.
While others disdain, the grateful child preserves its atti-
tude of kneeling submission. The criminal, who goes to
his death with the certainty that the belief of his children
in his innocence is unshaken, loses half the anguish of
the gallows.
By the same rule, the apprehension of a conscious fal-
terer in the path of rectitude, that rumours of his errors
will reach the ears of his children,-that their suspicions,
like those of the world, will be awakened, -that the eye
in which he has been accustomed to read the fulness of
love will become averted like the rest,—that the fond
pressure of the hand will be qualified, -the kiss embit-
tered,—the warm, trustful, heart-felt, soul-felt filial em-
brace delayed, - is, of all the punishments of human
frailty, the hardest to be borne.
And such was the apprehension which caused Richard
Hamlyn to pace with perturbed steps his handsome draw-
ing-room, shuffle his unexamined papers together, replace
them peevishly in his secretaire, and retreat to his anxious
pillow with a heavier pressure than usual upon his heart.
Long as had been his career of worldly care, acute as
was on many occasions the agony of his fears, he began
to feel that the shame of a public bankruptcy were trivial,

compared with having to stand in presence of his gentle-
manly sons, as one whose honour and honesty have given
way amid struggles which only serve to strengthen the
courage and stedfastness of genuine worth.
No rest that night for the throbbing head of Hamlyn
the banker!
CHAPTER XIII.
“As great and exalted spirits undertake the pursuit of hazardous actions for the
good of others, gratifying at the same time their own passion for glory, so do worthy
minds in the domestic way of life, undervaluing the ordinary gratifications of
wealth, exercise the great civil virtue of self-denial for the comfort of others. Such
natures one may call the stores of Providence ; for they are actuated by a secret
celestial influence."
."-ADDISON.
THOUGH Colonel Hamilton was vexed by the thwarting
of his projects in Henry Hamlyn's favour through his
mysterious absence from Cambridge and London, the
sanguine tone of the old gentleman's mind prevented his
dwelling upon his annoyance.
In the lesser as in the great events of life, his general
principle that “whatever is, is right,” reconciled him to
his infructuous journey.
“No doubt,” said he, while breakfasting with the good
Vicar the following morning—"no doubt the stupid gyp,
or your friend the learned Pundit of a tutor, made a mis.
take. 'Twas to Dean Park, not to Lon’on, the boy was
going. However, here we are; and though we've been
misled in our calculations, no need to make bad worse,
by not enjoying ourselves when we're in the
way
of
enjoyment.
Dr. Markham, already somewhat discountenanced by
the brilliancy and bustle of St. James's Street, felt almost
alarmed at the growing spirits of the joyous veteran.
But there was no help for it but to follow the guidance
of his
merry
leader.
“ You shall come with me after breakfast, Doctor, and
visit the Museum of our Club,” cried he.“ Then, after
we've skimmed the morning papers, we'll have a peep
into the Practical Science-concern, and you can have

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
your long face daguerreotyped, to take back to your good
little wife. After that, we'll look in at Hatchard's, and
see what they've got new on the counter: and, by the
way, those patent ventilators that the Sir Pompous, at
Lord Vernon's, was prosing about, and which I thought
would be such an improvement for the Ovington work-
house, they're sold somewhere in the Strand, I think?
The first hackney-coachman 'll show us the way. In
Lon'on, Wisdom cries aloud in the streets. So on with
your great-coat, my dear Doctor, and let's be stirring."
At that moment, the Colonel was unusually in conceit
with “ Lon'on;" for it was no longer the dreary Lon'on
of Portland Place or Cavendish Square. He was now in
the centre of stir, bustle, movement;-Trade, throbbing
in all its arteries,- Pleasure, giggling with all her co-
quetries.
There must be something unusual going on this
morning ?” said Dr. Markham, when, having turned the
angle of St. James's Street, Pall Mall lay before them,
enlivened by its bustle of palaces and exhibition-rooms,
auctions and public-offices, and the motley array of
lounging guardsmen and rigid sentries; to say nothing
of the luxury of wealth in the shop windows. The eyes
of the rustics were almost dazzled as they mingled with
the throng of well-dressed people hurrying joyously along
the pavement.
“Don't talk so confoundedly like a country cousin !"
cried the Colonel, in reply.
“ You remind me of the
Yorkshireman in the story, who stood aside all day long
in the Strand, to let the crowd go by. Recollect you're
not on Ovington causeway, man, and pluck up your
spirits.”
His sense of the rusticity of the Vicar inspired him, in
short, with the sauciness of a practised cockney. Never-
theless, by the time they reached the bottom of Waterloo
Place, the Colonel himself was struck by the unusual
bustle.
· Here's what the Lon’oners have the priggism to call
their modern Athens !” said he, pointing out the Carlton
quarter to the admiration of the Vicar; who stood trans-
fixed and wondering, much as the Colonel himself had

done in the centre of the Trinity quadrangle, the preced-
| ing day. “All pasteboard and stucco, all sham and show;
though an improvement, certainly, on the old brick walls,
pierced with windows, we used to call streets. These
clubs, these joint-stock-society companies, as I call 'em,
are a mighty addition, aren't they, to the splendours of
the town? They gave the example of improvement, I'm
told, in domestic architecture. 'Twas only by force of
public subscription people found out they could afford to
have brackets to their windows, and columns to their
doors. Some day or other, let's hope the Carlton will be
rich enough to build itself a marble palace, like the one
they tell of at Petersburg, or t'other that's stopped short
at its second story, in the tarnation grand city of Wash-
ington. The Reform Club's a fine thing, if 'twere not
for its little pig-eyed windows; though even those, the
judges say, are according to book. Is anything out of the
way going on this morning, pray ?" demanded the Colonel,
in his turn, suddenly addressing a waiter, standing on the
steps of the United Service Club, to whom he was known.
Nothing, sir, as I'm aware of, besides the meeting of
Parliament,” replied the man, taking his hands out of his
pockets in deference to the gray hairs and soldierly de-
meanour of the veteran; who, heedless of his respect or
disrespect, and exclaiming, “Gad, my dear Doctor, what a
couple of old blockheads we are, to have forgotten that
the eighteenth was the meeting of Parliament !” pushed
onwards with the unresisting Vicar towards the densely-
crowded neighbourhood of Charing Cross. The bells
of St. Martin's Church were ringing merrily, its flag
was hoisted, a troop of Life-Guardsmen was arriving;
and a detachment of police had already arrived to regu-
late the movements of the throng; while at the top of
Cockspur Street, Inspectors were stationed to decide what
aristocratic equipages were to pass down Whitehall, to
deposit their inmates at the door of the House of Lords,
and what carriages to be sent sneaking round to West-
minster, by the Strand and Waterloo Bridge.
“We're in luck, my dear Markham, we're in famous
luck!" exlaimed the Colonel; more than ever satisfied
that, notwithstanding his disappointment about Harry,

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
all was for the best. “A fine story you'll have to tell,
when you get back to the Vicarage, that we saw the
Queen, and Court, and Ministers, to say nothing of the
great lords and pretty ladies; and all without being a
pinch of snuff the worse for it, or putting ourselves a
step out of the way."
Brilliant equipages, crowded with officers in uniform,
or lovely women in gorgeous array, were in fact every
moment glancing past, on their way to the House of
Lords; while the windows and balconies of the houses in
Whitehall and Parliament Street were thronged with
well-dressed spectators, on the look-out for the royal
procession. Though the Life-Guards were active in
keeping the streets, it was difficult to restrain within due
bounds the crowds pushing their way towards West-
minster, in hopes of securing a view of the annual show.
“Let us station ourselves hereabouts," said the
Colonel, immediately after passing the Horse - Guards.
“ From hence, we shall have a capital view of the
pageant.”
But for the mere pageant, the good Vicar avowed
little interest.
“A state coach," said he, “is after all but a piece of
gilt gingerbread; a cumbrous, tawdry affair, fit only to
figure as a frontispiece to a child's story-book. But I
own I rejoice in the opportunity of obtaining a glimpse
of the Queen."
“What the deuce! You don't mean to say that you've
never seen her ?" cried the Colonel, in delighted
surprise.
“This is my first visit to London these seven years."
“Then, by George! I'd have travelled three times
three hundred miles, and welcome, to afford you the
pleasure," added the Colonel. “I hope I've been a
loyal man all my life, and prayed heartily for those that
were put in authority over me. I was thankful to king
George, in whose time the French were so preciously
beaten; and thankful to king William, for granting us
the blessings of Reform. But I never understood the
real thrill and glow of loyalty, Doctor, till I found myself
in
presence of that fair young creatur'; and felt that I,

199
a gray-haired man, shrank to nothing in her presence.
Blessings be upon her, say I, Doctor; blessings be upon
her! "Íill she was married, I felt somehow as though
'twere a daughter of my own; and I'll be bound, if
they'd own it, half the old blockheads in England ex-
perienced the same! And now she's a wife and mother,
I don't love her the less because I respect her the more.
Gad! I'm gladder than I can say, Doctor, that you'll be
treated with a look at the Queen.
At that moment, the discharge of the Park guns
announced the departure of the royal cortège from the
palace; and the bells of St. Margaret's chimed out a
merry peal. Again a few minutes, and the cheers of the
populace in the Park became audible in the distance;
gradually augmenting, till vehement shouts and loud
huzzas, overpowering the tramp of the horses that
formed the royal escort, announced her Majesty to be at
hand.
Unaccustomed to the throng of cities, Dr. Markham
felt alınost dizzy under the pressure of that tumultuous
assemblage. His feelings were overpowered. While
Hamilton was elated with a degree of joy rivalling
almost that of the boys clambering upon the lamp-posts
to command a view of the procession, the Vicar felt that
he had scarcely voice to shout among the rest Long
live the Queen!"
Already, uproarious cries to that effect resounded on
all sides. Alrcady, the leaders of the state-horses with
their gorgeous housings were in sight, emerging from
the gateway of the Horse - Guards; when Colonel
Hamilton was suddenly startled by an exclamation from
his companion of—“Henry Hamlyn, as I live."
“Where, where?" cried the Colonel, preparing to
join him, though the dense pressure of the crowd pre-
vented him from stirring an inch.
“In yonder carriage; the shabby yellow chariot
stationed on the opposite side of the gateway!” said
Dr. Markham, pointing to one in a knot of equipages
which, as usual on such occasions, had straggled to the
scene of action through the oversight of the police,
either at Charing Cross or Westminster; and though

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
buffeted by inspectors and reviled by the officer on duty,
contrived to stand its ground. The one pointed out.
by Dr. Markham appeared to have been unintentionally
hemmed in; for the young man whom he asserted to be
Henry Hamlyn was at that moment engaged in alter-
cation with the police, entreating for an order to pass,
and escape from the file.
“As if they'd allow e'er a carriage to move, just as
the percession is going by!" was the observation of
several persons in Colonel Hamilton's neighbourhood,
who had noticed the young man's appeal. “There the
carriage must stick, till the Queen has reached the
Parliament House, and no mistake!”
Secure at last of finding his young friend, the Colonel
allowed his whole attention to be engrossed by the
pageant; nor did the deafening cries that now rent the
air leave him much leisure for reflection. Among the
hearts throbbing around him at that moment with the
excitement of the scene, no two perbaps were more
fervently inspired by genuine warmth of loyalty, than
Colonel Hamilton and the Doctor.
“And now," cried the former, the moment the tramp-
ling escort of Life-Guards closing the procession, had
passed onwards towards Whitehall, -—"and now for that
scapegrace, Master Harry!"
But the group of carriages, again visible in consequence
of the disappearance of the intervening objects, had
shifted its position. A hackney-coach now occupied
the station taken up before by the yellow chariot ;
and a butterman's cart was the next vehicle in sight.
Carriages there were in abundance: green, chocolate,
crimson, blue, and yellow. But not the yellow. Not
the shabby-genteel equipage containing the object of his
search !
“I do believe the fellow's again escaped me!” cried
Colonel Hamilton, in a pet.
“I fear, indeed, that we have lost sight of him,"
replied the Vicar, as they followed the stream of idlers
moving towards Cockspur Street. “We are scarcely
likely to come up again with the yellow chariot!"
"Who the deuce was the scapegrace with ?" resumed

201
Colonel Hamilton. “ Did you notice, Doctor, who were
his companions ?"
“Two ladies in deep mourning."'.
“One of 'em with a remarkably fine cast of coun-
tenance, in a black velvet bonnet ?” persisted the
Colonel.
“Precisely."
“I noticed her as the carriage passed us to take up its
position; but without at all suspecting that the young
fellow in her company was Hamlyn's son. At that time,
I might almost have laid my hand on his coat-sleeve !
By George! 'tis too provoking."
To give a new turn to the Colonel's ideas, Dr. Mark-
ham proposed that they should now proceed to Mivart's,
to inquire for Mrs. Robert Hamilton. But he had
already despatched Johnston thither, on a similar errand;
who brought back the unsatisfactory answer that no lady
of that name was either there, or expected.
Still, no need occasion for despondency. The two far
from uncongenial companions contrived to spend the
morning in a succession of interesting visits and surveys ;
and, as Dr. Markham was desirous of passing the re-
mainder of the day with a sister of his wife, settled in
the neighbourhood of Russell Square, to whom he had
already intimated his arrival in town, Colonel Hamilton
dined at his Club; and had the satisfaction to perceive
that its ultra-Oriental cuisine was unequal to the pro-
duction of a prawn-currie rivalling that of Goody
Johnston.
“See here, my dear Doctor. I entreat, just look at
my luck!”—cried he, when Dr. Markham made his
appearance at the breakfast-table, the following morning.
“Cast your eyes upon this deuce of a Morning
Post!”
“News of Mr. Henry Hamlyn?" demanded the Vicar,
taking the paper into his hand, and perceiving that the
finger of the Colonel pointed to the list of “ FASHIONABLE
CHANGES.
“Worse a thousand times !--Of my daughter-in-law!"
And thus enlightened, the Doctor had no difficulty in
discovering an announcement among the “Departures"

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
of " Mrs. Robert Hamilton from Coulson's Hotel, to the
seat of Colonel Hamilton in Warwickshire.”
“ Vexatious, indeed,” cried the Vicar, " that you, who
so seldom leave home, should have been absent on her
arrival at the Manor !"
“She'll think, maybe, I did it o' purpose, and fancy
me wanting in respect. I wouldn't have had it happen
for the world! As if I hadn't enough to answer already
towards her,-poor soul!"
“We might reach Burlington Manor by dinner-time,
if we started by the first train," said the Doctor, a leetle
disappointed at this precipitate departure.
“Of course! I've already told Johnston to pack up.
I ventured it without consulting you, my dear Doctor,
knowing how glad you'd be to get out of this smoky
metropolis, and back to your flock. We shall be off in
an hour. Still, 'tisn't like being on the spot with open
arms to welcome the poor girl to her strange home. Ten
to one, she wrote to announce her arrival, and the letter
miscarried. One's never sure of foreign letters. Poor
Ellen !- Hard
upon
her; but harder still upon me!”
And Dr. Markham readily discerned by the flutter of
the old gentleman's spirits, how greatly he was excited
by the anticipation of this meeting with the widow of his
Throughout their journey, instead of being cheerful
and chatty as usual, he was absent and silent. He was
back again at Ghazerapore, receiving his son's first
letter announcing that disastrous attachment, and listen-
ing to the mild intercessions of his wife. He was alone
with Mary, and Mary with him. Dusky figures, in
Oriental garbs, were loitering in the distance. Balmy
smells of tropical plants were in the air. He was again
an exile, again a husband, again a father; and a happy
and contented exile, because a father and a husband.
And, lo! as these scenes passed before his mind's eye,
heavy sighs burst unconsciously from his bosom ; 80
deeply was the old man moved by tender associations of
affection and remorse, connected with the name of Ellen
Somerton.
“I'll make her happy yet !-By George! she shall be
lost son.

OR, COURT AND CITY.
203
happy yet !” was his concluding reflection. “So long
as Mrs. Hamlyn and Lydia remain at Dean, she'll find
no occasion for moping at the Manor: and a’ter’ards, we
may still manage well enough. At all events, she'll
have her own way; and, for nine women in ten, that's
a’most happiness enough. But though I'd give my little
finger to know what brought about her intimacy with
Harry Hamlyn enough to correspond with him, (as her
own handwriting bore me witness,) I'll not force myself
upon her confidence. I shall soon see whether she
intends to be a heart-in-heart daughter to me; or whe-
ther there's a spice of rancour at the bottom of her
heart."
As usually the case with travellers in an inordinate
hurry, delay occurred. In consequence of an accident to
the preceding train, they were kept three hours at the
Weedon station, when the impatience of the poor Colonel
was at its highest; and as, on arriving at Rugby, there
were still twelve miles to be accomplished across country,
they did not reach the outskirts of Ovington till the
village-clock was striking ten. All was still. A few
straggling lights were alone perceptible in the cottages ;
and so tardy were the unprepared inmates of the Vicarage
in answering the gate-bell rung by the postboy, that, in
pity to the impatience of his companion, Dr. Markham
insisted on getting out to await the coming of his servant,
while the Colonel proceeded post-haste to the Manor.
After the usual delay at the park-lodge of an early-to-
bed and early-to-rise gatekeeper, and the ordinary excla-
mations of wonder on the part of Goody Johnston when
at length the Colonel obtained admittance into his own
house, she hastened to acquaint her master that Mrs.
Robert had arrived that morning, and already, worn by
the fatigues of her journey, had retired for the night.
Plague take it! I'd have given anything for a sight
of her afore I slept!” cried the old man.

Better late than never. I must wait till morning. I

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
in respect, Colonel, to poor dear Master Robert's widow,"
replied Mrs. Johnston, with some dignity; and as she
toddled out of the room to issue orders for tea and
supper for the belated traveller, her master perceived
that she had arrayed herself in her utmost pomp
of silk
and lace, to do honour to their guest.
“ Perhaps 'tis as well, poor thing, she should be a-bed
and asleep!” mused Colonel Hamilton, as he sat down
to tea; for, in spite of this philosophical ejaculation, his
disappointment had deprived him of all appetite for cold
fowl and partridge-pie. And he patted Pincher anew
upon his grizzly head; and master and dog were looking
wistfully into the fire, as if both were thinking of
Ghazerapore and poor Mary,--when the drawing-room
door was gently opened, and in glided a slender figure
in a white dressing-gown; who advanced towards the
Colonel neither with the impetuosity of a heroine, nor
the hesitation of a person uncertain of her reception.
She approached, with extended hands, as if conscious of
her right to be there, and to welcome him, as the last
comer, to their common home.
“I could not wait till to-morrow morning!” said she,
after being folded to the old man's heart with a degree of
fervour that brought tears into her eyes.—Not, however,
upon her cheeks; for Ellen was a person too accustomed
to subdue her emotions to indulge, as she felt inclined, in
a flood of tears.—“I was so disappointed, sir, at not find-
ing you this morning, (having stupidly travelled by night
for the purpose of surprising you,) that I retired to bed
earlier than usual, to sleep off my ill-humour. I know
you will forgive me for not having waited to dress !” said
she, in broken sentences, which had all the grace of com-
ing warm from the heart.
As soon as his own eyes were clear enough from tears,
the old man drew back to contemplate the daughter-in-
law whose fatal beauty had been the cause of so much
family trouble; and instantly admitted to himself that in
this utter dishabille, with her white gown folded loosely
round her, and her black hair fastened in perfect simpli-
city round her head, Ellen had the air of a duchess.
* Poor Bob was right," said he, in the aching depths of

205
his heart. “By George! she's the most beautiful crea-
tur' on the face o' the earth!”
These sentiments of genuine admiration did not dimi-
nish, while, drinking his tea, he sat watching the varying
expression of her fine countenance as, in answer to his
hurried inquiries, she described her arrival in town by an
Antwerp steam-boat escorted by her servants, the day
before, after pursuing her way from Switzerland by the
Rhine.
“I am a perverse and obstinate creature, as you will
soon find, dear sir,” said she, placed perfectly at her
ease by the cordiality of her father-in-law. “So having
always made up my mind to return through Germany to
England, I persevered in my intentions, though the Rhine
presented nothing to my admiration but blocks of ice and
leafless forests."
Such was her mode of evading the avowal that she had
been unwilling to pursue, on her homeward course, the
same route she had taken to Italy, three years before, in
company with her unfortunate husband.
“And thus, my dear Ellen, you and I, who have neither
of us any more call to Lon'on than though we were
foreigners, were actually in town at the same moment,"
cried he, in his turn. And as he uttered the words,
some peculiar turn of expression in the beautiful face on
which his eyes were riveted, suddenly recalled to mind a
similar countenance on which they had lately rested; so
lately, that he felt puzzled, as if by the realization of a
dream.
At length, the truth darted into his mind. It cer-
tainly was Mrs. Hamilton he had seen in the carriage at
the Horse-Guards! The contrast between her white
wrapper and the mourning weeds in which she was then
attired, had alone prevented immediate recognition.
He was about to burst into an exclamation touching
this curious encounter, when, suddenly reverting to the
letter he had discovered on the desk of Henry Hamlyn,
and the presence of his young friend in her carriage, he
mastered his impulses of frankuess, and forbore.
"I won't force myself on their confidence," was his
secret determination. “ Neither of 'em know ine yet

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
enough to be aware whether I'm trustworthy. If, at the
end of a week or so, she don't speak out, 'twill be time
enough to inquire why she should make a mystery of the
acquaintance."
It was a long time since the Colonel had retired to his
pillow so happy in the sense of not being quite alone in
the world, as he felt that night, under the certainty that
his son's widow was enjoying a comfortable night's rest
in the chintz-room at the end of the corridor.
Next morning, the old gentleman woke to a still
happier sensation. To come down to breakfast with
the expectation of having that noble brow on which to
imprint a parental kiss, was a comfort indeed to the
kindly heart so long debarred the solace of female com-
panionship; and as he contemplated her again from head
to foot, he could not help admitting, with mingled pain
and pleasure, how proud poor Mary would have been of
such a daughter-in-law.
It was a happy morning for both. The sun was civil
enough to shine as brightly on their walk, after break-
fast, as it had done on the Whitehall pageant; and the
Colonel felt that he had seldom had a companion more to
his taste than when Ellen leant upon his arm to visit the
Thibet goats, and accompanied him, escorted by Pincher
and Carlo, to his usual haunts in the park and poultry-
yard; where two or three favourite deer came ambling
forward from the herd to be fed by his hand, while the
peacocks, after creeping to his feet, set up their tails in
vain-glorious rivalship, to attract his attention.
“I'm fond of dumb animals,-fond of 'em as a child!"
said the Colonel, as he led her off towards the stables, to
exhibit his stud, unaware how purely childlike were all
his tastes and affections. “I mustn't plague you, though,
with showing off my favourites. Fond of riding, eh!
Ellen ?-Anything of a horsewoman?—Then, by George!
you shall have the most perfect lady's horse in the
county. There's a half-bred Arabian I heard of at
Leamington, out of the Ormeau stud, which I was in-
quiring about for my little Lydia's birthday. 'Twas too
tall her. But you shall have it afore we're a week
older. I'm afraid you must put up with Old Snobby's

company by way of escort, my dear. The only beau
we've got hereabouts, young Hamlyn, has just started
for Melton."
As this allusion had no ulterior motive, (what allusion
of the Colonel's ever had ?) he was startled by the
sudden suffusion of Mrs. Hamilton's cheeks, as he just
then confronted her for a moment in opening the door of
his fine, airy, roomy, thirty-stall stable, one of the sur-
viving evidences of poor Sir Roger Burlington's extrava-
gance. He had not conceived it possible that a woman
naturally devoid of colour, could blush so deep a scarlet.
From the stable, they proceeded to the conservatories ;
and, had the pragmatical Anderson still presided over
their arrangements, he would have been indignant at the
recklessness with which Colonel Hamilton tore down the
fairest blossoms, and stripped the air-plants of every
semblance of bloom, the moment his daughter-in-law
expressed a desire for a nearer view of their curious
organization. All the devastations he had ever com-
mitted to please Miss Hamlyn, were nothing compared
with the result of the quarter of an hour spent by Ellen
in the Burlington Conservatory.
“I wish to goodness you'd seen it in summer-time,
with the fountains playing and the birds singing !” said
he. “But 'twas your own fault, Ellen. Why not come
home at once, when you heard the old man had a roof
over his head, and was all alone under it?— We've lost a
many pleasant months together, my dear girl; but we've
a many, I trust, in store for us. I'm glad you're fond o’
flowers, Ellen. 'Tis a nat’ral womanly liking; accustoms
ladies to out-o'-door pleasures, and makes 'em healthy,
and happy, and wise. Lydia and her mother are fond o’
flowers; and if it hadn't been for them, last summer, my
roses might as well have been blooming at Ghazerapore.
You'll love Lydia and her mother, Ellen !- Lydia must
have been a mere child when you were at Dean afore ?
She's now a promising young creatur'. You mustn't
take a prejudice against Lydia 'cause she's my friend
Hamlyn's daughter!"-
Why should you suppose me likely to be unfavour.

TIIE BANKER'S WIFE ;
inquired Mrs. Hamilton, in a graver tone than she had
yet assumed towards her father-in-law.
"'Cause you're a woman, my dear; -a good one and a
charming, I'm fain to believe ; but still, a woman. And
I never saw the petticoat yet, from a Begum to a cobbler's
wife, that didn't hide in her heart a little ugly corner
for the resentment of injuries. There's nothing a woman
understands so little, I take it, as how to forgive.”
Spontaneously, poor Ellen pressed the arm on which
she was leaning, in token that there were some offences
she had fully pardoned.
“On the whole, my dear,” resumed the Colonel, “I'm
not sure that I like you the less for the frown I saw con-
tract your brows, last night, when I accidentally stumbled
on the name of Richard Hamlyn; 'cause so long as you
vent
any
little
anger you may still feel upon him, I've
the better chance of being let off. The banker shall be
my whipping-boy, if you please; and you may flog away
to your heart's content.--Only, I claim exemption for the
banker's wife.”
“You cannot claim it more warmly than I am disposed
to grant it,” said Ellen, frankly. “For her, my short visit
to Dean impressed me with sincere liking and respect."
“You'll walk over with me, then, to see her, after
breakfast to-morrow, if, as I suppose, they arrive from
Rotherwood Castle to-night?”
Mrs. Hamilton made no reply; and the Colonel,
fancying his voice had been drowned just then by the
click of the swing-gate of Ovington Vicarage, which they
were entering, reiterated his question.
“It will be scarcely according to etiquette for me to
call on Mrs. Hamlyn first,” said she. “I had better
wait, perhaps, for her visit."
“Well! I never should have fancied you the sort of
girl to stand on idle ceremony,” cried he. “I thought
you'd too much sense and feeling. You don't know how
I loved you, my dear, for tumbling out o’ bed in your
dressing-gown and slippers, last night, to make my
acquaintance.
“Mrs. Hamlyn,” replied Ellen, somewhat embarrassed,
“ has not my poor Robert's blood in her veins."

“Oh! if it is but that !” retorted the Colonel, press-
ing her arm in his turn. “Only as you made no objec-
tion to accompany me here, to visit good Mrs. Markham,
who's no more related to us than t'other-
“ The wife of the clergyman of the parish must always
be the first personage in it,” observed Ellen, calmly,
“and as such entitled to the utmost deference.”
“ And Mrs. Hamlyn—" the Colonel was beginning.
But at that moment they were received on the doorsteps
by Dr. Markham, who cordially conducted the beautiful
stranger to his wife. A cheerful conversation ensued;
whieh satisfied the Markhams of the important addition
achieved by their little circle. Mrs. Hamilton was open,
cheerful, intelligent; and when (according to Vicarage-
custom whenever the Colonel paid them a visit) the
children made their appearance, and Ellen took the
youngest into her arms and made much of it, so lovely
did she look with the crimson cheek of little Kitty nest-
ling against her own, that tears arose, for the tenth time
that day, in the eyes
of the
poor
Colonel.
“Ah! if he'd only left a child !” murmured the old
man to himself, as he turned towards the window to
conceal his emotion; “if he'd only left a child !-Poor
Bob!—'twas all Hamlyn's doing. He meant no harm, I
dare say,—but 'twas all Hamlyn's doing!-Well! God's
will be done!-'Tis something to be able to press the
hand of his widow.”
CHAPTER XIV.
“Those cherished torments of our lives,
The best of daughters and of wives."-VANE.
GREAT was the vexation of Richard Hamlyn at finding,
on his arrival at home to a late dinner from the House, a
couple of days after the meeting of Parliament, that his
wife and daughter were waiting for him in the drawing-
room. Like Lord Vernon, he felt indignant at being
too punctually obeyed; for it was only because, on the

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Colonel's sudden visit to town, he had written to desire
they would not proceed from Rotherwood to Dean Park,
but at once to Cavendish Square, that his family had ac-
celerated their departure to London for the season. Mrs.
Hamlyn's eager inquiry of, "Where is Colonel Hamilton,
- when is his daughter-in-law expected ?" sufficiently
proved that her husband's supplementary letters of in-
struction had crossed her on the road.
Now they were come, however, leaving the artful
Mrs. Hamilton to establish herself fully and firmly in the
good graces of her soft-hearted father-in-law, all that re-
mained was to make the best of it. The London season
had already begun, for that middle-class order of parlia-
mentary men whose pleasures consist in their Wednesday
and Saturday dinners, rather than in balls and parties.
Ministerial cards were out,-a levee and drawing-room
announced,—the Opera was about to open; and Mr.
Hamlyn felt that he had no good reason to assign to his
favourite "world," for prolonging the sojourn of his family
at Dean Park.
A London banker, having a handsome establishment in
town, is held bound to re-assemble his domesticities about
him, as soon as may be after the meeting of Parliament.
It would look odd,” were his usual dinner-parties sus-
pended. It would “look odd,” were his wife to be
without an opera-box during the season of his daughter's
débút. It would look odd," were his pew in Mary-le-
bone Church to be empty, when the Christmas holly
adorning that in Ovington Church was dried up and
withered; and a banker is bound to eschew all and any-
thing that“ looks odd.”. Everything about him, in public
or private life, should be as even as the balance of his
books.
On the morning following Mrs. Hamlyn's arrival in
town, just as her husband was setting off to the city, she
was startled by his placing in her hand notes to the
amount of four hundred pounds.
“I consider it necessary, said he, “that my daughter
should make her first appearance in society with the
advantages becoming Miss Hamlyn of Dean Park. She
must have everything that is handsome and suitable; and

let half the
money
in
your
hand be added to your own
pin-money."
“ Believe me, we neither of us require anything of the
kind,” exclaimed Mrs. Hamlyn, endeavouring to replace
the notes in his hand. " And surely you informed me,
the other day, at Dean, (in reference to your disappoint-
ments with regard to Harry,) that the house was in no con-
dition to support any additional stress on its resources ?”
Are you mad ?" cried her husband, seizing her arm,
and drawing her away from the study-door, near which
they were standing, towards a distant window. “The
men are in the dining-room removing the breakfast-things.
If Ramsay should hear you—"
“I fancied myself speaking low.”
“You spoke like a fool, as all women do the moment
they pretend to talk about business!" cried Hamlyn, in
reckless irritation. “Once for all, take these notes and
employ them according to my instructions. It is my
wish that you make arrangements for presenting Lydia
at the next drawing-room.
“Still, there will be no occasion for such an expenditure
as this. The utmost she requires is twenty guineas for
a court-dress. She has the fine pearls presented to her
by Colonel Hamilton; and I have accidentally discovered
that he is having a pair of splendid diamond-ear-rings
reset for her at Rundell's !"
I shall not allow her to accept them !" observed Mr.
Hamlyn sternly. “Such a display on the person of a
girl would be considered profligate extravagance on the
part of a banker's family, and to explain them every-
where as the gift of Colonel Hamilton, would be like an-
nouncing intentions towards her, on his part, which I
neither expect nor wish to see realized to the injury of
my son. Any one who wants to marry Lydia must be
satisfied with her five thousand pounds."
“With such prospects, it is surely unnecessary to in.
dulge in a foolish outlay for her introduction to society,"
pleaded the banker's wife.
The banker stood gazing at her in astonishment. It
was the first resistance to his will she had hazarded in
the course of five-and-twenty years of married life; and

her resolution was now too calmly asserted to afford any
hope of putting down her opposition by violence.
Pray follow your own devices in this !” he resumed,
in a voice as mild as her own. “It ought not to surprise
me that, at a moment when my interests in life are sink-
ing, and all the world seems in league to overwhelm à
falling man, my own family should be the first to give the
signal for the insults of the rest."
By the involuntary start of the distressed Sophia,
Hamlyn perceived that this stroke had told; that the
feelings of the wife of his youth were touched to the
quick.
“You shall be obeyed !” said she, extending her hand
with a desponding air, to receive the notes he was still
holding “All I have to entreat is, that when the tree of
evil shall bring forth bitter fruit, you will not accuse me
of having fostered its growth.”
“You shall be accused of nothing !" replied Hamlyn
coldly. “We must stand or fall together; and at our
time of life, the standing or falling is of less consequence.
The better half of our days is over; and, as far as I am
concerned, the best they have afforded inspires me with
little interest in the remnant. But the children must be
considered. The children have a long career before
them. The fair prospects of Walter-the-the-"
He could not proceed. In naming his son, he was
on the point of giving way to a weakness very unusual
on the part of the banker. The heart of his wife thrilled
within her as she contemplated what seemed to afford
hope that the barren rock might still be touched, and
yield the waters of life.
"By those prospects, then,” cried she, earnestly-"by
the future prosperity and happiness of your son, I im-
plore you to involve yourself no further. If the firm be em-
barrassed, as you owned to me at Dean, let us retrench,-
let us cut short all idle expenses. We might reduce &
fifth of our present outlay. Instead of commencing a
showy, extravagant season, why not let this house to some
advantageous tenant, and retire to Dean Park? You
have apartments at the banking-house which"
“Thank you!" replied Hamlyn, with a bitter smile.

“If you desired to place the names of Hamlyn and Co.
in the Gazette, you could scarcely suggest a surer course.
When I wish to rouse the anxieties of my customers, and
point myself out to the mistrust of the City, I will
apply to you for the speediest method of effecting my
ruin. Till then, I will not trouble you for further inter-
ference in my affairs than I have been in the habit of
asking. I endeavour to render your life as easy as pros-
perity can make it. I have never sought to burthen you
with participation in my cares."
“ And it is that,” replied Mrs. Hamlyn, in deep emo-
tion," which makes me accuse myself as in some measure
the origin of your reverses. But for your desire to place
your family in an honourable position in society, you—"
Compose yourself! You have no share in the re-
sponsibility!" was the banker's bitter answer. “ But
since thus reckless in allusions to what cannot be even
whispered in safety in the stillest watches of the night, I
conclude you adduced, as an excuse for my breaking my
engagement with Lord and Lady Rotherwood, that I was
forced to hurry to London in consequence of the recent
failure at Liverpool ?”
“ Have I ever injured your interests by indiscretion ?”
replied Mrs. Hamlyn, with a sinking heart and voice.
“For the last twenty years, I have been keeping watch
over my words and actions. I excused you on the grounds
of urgent business. But Lady Rotherwood was too much
occupied by her sister's illness to take much heed.”
“The Marchioness of Dartford, then, is dangerously
ill? In that case, her son will scarcely be able to join
Walter at Melton ?"
“I should think not. I was sorry to find Walter had
so hastily quitted Dean for a place so likely to increase
his expenses!"
My son acted with my perfect approbation,” replied
the banker coldly.
“Lady Rotherwood spoke to me with great regret of
the dissipated habits of life in which her nephew is be-
ginning to indulge. It is the desire of his family that he
should settle young."
“And you fancy, perhaps, that the aunt who grudges

him a few weeks' hunting at Melton, would promote his
alliance with a girl having only a few thousand pounds
for her fortune !"
'It is not the cost of Lord Dartford's pleasures that
creates the uneasiness of his family. With respect to
Lydia, Lady Rotherwood was generous enough to own to
me, in plain terms, that it would give her real pleasure
should her nephew attach himself to so sensible and pru-
dent a girl as my daughter. I tell you this since you
have thought proper to allude to the subject. But, having
no reason to suppose the Marquis’s intentions serious, I
shall dismiss it from my mind. That of Lydia, I am cer-
tain, it has never entered."
“So much the better!" was Mr. Hamlyn's surly reply,
as he prepared to quit the room. “Even were the match
possible, which it is not, it would ill suit me to produce
just now, the sum indispensable for the dowry of a Mar.
chioness of Dartford.”
Prepared by this painful interview for the policy her
husband persisted in pursuing, it did not surprise Mrs.
Hamlyn to find that a handsome new carriage was build-
ing for her, and an excellent opera-box engaged; or that
invitations were already issued for dinners twice a week
in Cavendish Square, for three weeks to come.
“ You certainly are the happiest woman in the world,
my dear! You have a jewel of a husband !" cried Lady
Bondwell, the wife of a brother banker, who was usually
neck-and-neck with Hamlyn in his sordid ostentations.
"I was at Storr and Mortimer's yesterday, and must
admit that your new wine-cistern is perfect. But what
is there you have not got? Whenever I want to know
what is to be the fashion for the season, I hasten to
Cavendish Square."
This was, to a certain degree, true; but the luxurious-
ness imposed upon her was a matter of pain and grief to
Mrs. Hamlyn. Though she dared not recur to the subject
of pecuniary difficulties adverted to by her husband
under the excitement produced by Henry's unlooked-for
opposition to his wishes, she had reason to infer from
the additional expenditure daily incurred by Mr. Hamlyn,
and the forced spirits he exhibited in society, that his

215
anxieties were undiminished. But for this, she would
have been inclined to hope that her husband's apprehen-
sions were assumed, for the purpose of inducing her to
influence the resolution of his son.
And such had been indeed the result of his strange
confidences. Though she had failed in procuring Colonel
Hamilton's interference with Henry, her own letters had
reached her son during his absence from Cambridge;
imploring (without any prohibited allusion to the diffi-
culties of the firm) for her sake, for the sake of the
mother who loved him so dearly, to abstain from opposi-
tion to his father's will.
“I have reason to know," she wrote, “that the welfare
of the family, of your brother and sisters, (for of your
mother, dearest, I will not even plead the claims,) depends
on the certainty of a successor in the business, interested
to protect their property in the event of your father's
demise. Your cousin Bernard, weak alike in health and
intellect, is every way incompetent for such a responsi-
bility. I entreat you, therefore, sacrifice your disinclina-
tion, and do the part of a son and brother towards us all.
Your generous disposition cannot be better exercised
than in such a sacrifice. My Henry, your mother asks it
of you on her knees !—Make the trial--make the attempt.
Do not—do not wantonly oppose your unhappy father.”
To such an appeal, the answer of young Hamlyn was,
of course, implicit submission; and Mrs. Hamlyn had the
satisfaction of conveying to her husband intelligence of
his son's acquiescence. But poor Henry, while despatch-
ing to his admonitress his dutiful compliance, was only
too painfully aware that, like Coriolanus of old, sub-
mission to his mother conveyed ruin to bimself. Com-
pelled to resign his short-lived hopes of enfranchisement
from the calling he detested, his mind became compara-
tively disabled. Those who were watching with interest
his course of study, now so nearly approaching its crisis,
saw, with grief, that, at the eleventh hour, the young
man's courage had deserted him. His exertions were
flagging. There was no longer an incentive to study,
now that the utmost distinctions he could attain would
avail nothing towards the redemption of his destinies.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“ She will never be mine! She has told me she will
never be mine if I involve myself in the hateful specula-
tions which have hardened the heart of
my
father," was
his ever-recurring reflection.
“ To have marred my own
prospects in life by compliance with her peculiar preju-
dices, I should not, Heaven knows, have hesitated. But
my
mother-1
-my poor dear mother, appealing to me in
behalf of her children, must not be denied. Scarcely
more painful to me to renounce my hope of Ellen's
affections, than to refuse the request of my mother.”
Still, the conflict was not the less injurious. He could
no longer apply the sterling faculties of his mind to
difficulties unimportant, so long as university distinctions
promised to pave the way to professional distinction.
“Oh! that I had never attempted that mad expedition
to Naples!" he would exclaim, flinging down his books
and pacing the quiet room, so long devoted to the
abstraction of severe study.
“ But for
my
desire to look
once more upon that lovely face, the object of
my
dreams
from the moment when, as a happy bride, she spoke so
soothingly to the young enthusiast who beset her at
Dean with his flighty fancies, I might now be the same
contented book-worm as of old,—the same prospective
man of business. Till Ellen Hamilton placed the picture
of a banker's calling fairly before me, I was contented
with my prospects. But now, even if she would consent
to share a mode of existence she detests and despises, I
could never be happy, deriving my livelihood from per-
petual risk of the property of others. Wretched man
that I shall be, the moment I quit these quiet walls !
without leisure to open a book,-without power to forget
or to renew those blessed hopes and impressions, vouch-
safed me for a moment, only to constitute the torment
of my life !”
Instead of persevering in the course of study pointed
out as indispensable to repair the omissions produced by
his Italian tour, the dispirited Henry wasted his days
and nights in cultivating associations derived from the
relics around him,-the sketches,--the engravings, and,
above all, the luckless myrtle branch-the first pledge of
an ill-fated attachment, which he had received from

217
the hands of Ellen, when visiting with Lady Burlington
and herself the Grotto of the Sybil at Cumæ.
“ What matters it now how I go through my examina-
tion!” cried he, shrugging his shoulders, on receiving an
announcement that others were getting the start of him
in the race.
“If I could carry off all the prizes in the
university, what signify college honours to Henry Hamlyn,
the banker!”
In writing to announce to Mrs. Hamilton his com-
pliance with the injunctions of his mother, Henry had
not presumed to give vent to these feelings.
“She used to call me boyish and inconsistent," was
his bitter reflection. “ How often did she remind me
that she is nearly two years older than myself in age,
and ten in character! When I pledged myself to comply
with her exactions about the firm, she predicted that I
should never have strength of purpose to carry through
my opposition to a man so arbitrary as my father. Dear,
precious Ellen! I will not attempt to move her com-
passion by the pitiful avowal of all I am suffering. She
was frank with me. She owned she could not be happy
with me if the greater portion of my day was spent in my
father's counting-house. It were despicable to overcome
her scruples by the picture of my despair."
Cold, therefore, almost to formality, were the terms in
which the high-minded young man announced a sacrifice,
the mere anticipation of which was tearing his heart-
strings asunder; and Ellen was justified in feeling that
already the spirit of his future vocation was upon him,"
and that he wrote like a banker.” Not a word of
appeal to her affections; not a loophole left for her
relenting. So coolly did he speak of himself and of his
projects, that there was every reason to suppose he
rejoiced in the difficulties she had thrown in the
way
of
their union.
“If my poor dear mother only surmised the extent of
the sacrifice she was exacting from her son!” was Henry's
ejaculation, after perusing, for the twentieth time, the
almost haughty reply of Ellen Hamilton to the letter,
acknowledging his altered intentions, which cancelled
their brief engagement.—"But may she never know

it!-As it is, her life is not a happy one. It would only
be a thousand-fold more grievous for learning that she
has broken my heart.”
“I'm most afraid, my dear girl, that you calculated too
far on your own patience," — observed the Colonel, on
the other hand, to his daughter-in-law, when, at the end
of a fortnight's sojourn at Burlington Manor, he perceived
that her steps were growing less lightsome, and her voice
less joyous, Than on her first arrival. “You didn't reckon
what 'twould be to live cooped up, morning, noon, and
night, with an old codger like myself!".
“I do not feel the slightest want of society," she re-
plied, and with sincerity.
"I can promise you, however, that when I pressed you
so hard to come and stay at the Manor, I wouldn't have
done so for worlds, hadn't I thought that Lydia and her
good mother would cheer you with their constant com-
pany, as they did me through the summer and autumn,
Poor Madam Markham is always taken up (the more's
the credit to her) with her bantlings and poor. As to
those great folks at The Hyde, you might get as good
company out of the effigies of their forefathers on the
tombs in Braxbam Church!"
“If all the rest of the family resemble Mr. Vernon,"
replied Ellen, “I cannot express much regret for the want
of their acquaintance."
“They don't resemble him, my dear. They're ten
times worse.
Alberic's the best of the bunch. How-
ever, he gave me a welcome piece of news yesterday,
when he stopped my phaeton, driving through Ovington.
Walter Hamlyn will be at Dean Park to-morrow. That
is, young Vernon told me Lord Dartford was coming; and
the Captain will hardly leave him to be entertained by
the servants. So now, my dear, you'll be able to extend
your rides beyond the park-paling of Burlington Manor."
“I have no desire to play truant,” she replied, with a
melancholy smile, very different from those which bright-
ened her fine features on her arrival from Italy. “ And
I am quite satisfied with Carlo's protection, if I had it at
heart to scour the country.”
“Without scouring the country, you might extend

your excursions to see something of the neighbourhood.
However, you must look to your heart, Ellen, when this
young soldier comes flourishing his mustachios among us.
Watty's the handsomest young fellow you ever set eyes
on; and to own the truth, Ellen,” continued the Colonel,
“I've more than half a wish, that if you should ever make
up your mind to marry again-
“I never shall !” interrupted Ellen, in a low but steady
voice. Rely upon it I never shall !''
“ I am sorry to hear you say so. Sacred as is
my
son's
memory in my eyes, I feel that you didn't live long enough
with poor Robert, and that you're yourself too young and
handsome,-much too young and handsome, to tie your-
self down to widowhood for the remainder of your days.
Tisn't nat'ral, my dear, and 'tisn't what anybody has a
right to expect of you. So, as I was saying, if you ever
were to take another husband, I can't but own that my
friend Hamlyn's son would be more acceptable to me as
a son-in-law, than e'er another. For a son-in-law your
husband would seem to me! Now that I've come to see
and know and love you, Ellen, I feel as if you were a
born daughter of my own."
As the Colonel had confidently expected, the cheeks of
his lovely companion were deeply crimsoned at his allu-
sion to his “friend Hamlyn's son.” But he wanted
courage to force himself upon her confidence; and before
the conclusion of his sentence, was moved to a degree
that precluded all exercise of watchfulness.
“ And so, my dear,” he resumed, after a momentary
pause, “if this Household-Brigade chap should happen to
take your fancy, so much the better for all parties.
Hamlyn would be proud, I'm sure, to ask for his son the
hand he was so scrupulous about bestowing upon mine."
“No doubt he would,-after hearing your paternal
declarations in my favour,” replied the young widow,
with a swelling heart and bitter smile. "Your heiress,
my dear Colonel Hamilton, whether actress, sempstress,
or any other degraded being, would be welcomed by the
banker on his bended knees."
“Come, come,--don't be too hard upon him. Hamlyn's
the most honourable fellow on the face of the earth. I

could tell you some traits of Hamlyn that do honour to
the name of man. Surely, my dear, since you've been
down in these parts, you must have seen and admitted
the value of an active, benevolent, steady, thoughtful
man of business, to the varied interests of the neighbour-
hood under his protection."
“I have no doubt Mr. Hamlyn is a man of considerable
influence and importance. He contributes largely to the
local charities. Šo does Mr. Gratwycke, (the fourth part,
I am told, of his very moderate income !) which does not
prevent my thinking the old gentleman a far from agree-
able companion.”
“A man may pay a large subscription to the treasurer
of an hospital, and be none the better Christian. Grat-
wycke, I admit, is a case in point. Old Grat. never be-
stows his guinea on one of the county institutions, with-
out adding, 'It shall never be said that the name of Grat-
wycke of Gratwycke forfeited in my time its station among
the county families.' But Hamlyn's another guess sort
of fellow. Hamlyn sets his wits to work for the benefit
of his fellow-creatures as well as his purse. See here!"
continued the Colonel, suddenly snatching forward the
Times newspaper that lay upon the table, and commenc-
ing, as fluently as the absence of his spectacles would
permit, a recital of the proceedings of a grand “ Meeting
of the Merchants and Bankers of the City of London,
held at the Mansion House the preceding day,
“RICHARD HAMLYN, Esq., M.P., in the chair, for the
relief of the sufferers by a recent inundation at St. Peters-
burg,"--prefaced by an eloquent preamble, and followed
by a pompous list of subscriptions, at the head of which
stood the firm of HAMLYN AND Co. for £105,-" What
d'ye say to that, Mrs. Ellen ?”
“ Were I not afraid you would call me prejudiced and
illiberal, that Hamlyn and Co. are probably extensively
connected with Russian Trade."
Colonel Hamilton, who knew this to be the case, could
not refrain from patting her approvingly on the back.
“You're a cunning little gipsy!" said he. “Let a
woman alone for diving into motives.”
“Let a woman alone for diving into motives who has

beer cast alone and unprotected on the evil-dealing of
the world. Had I never been injured by Mr. Hamlyn, I
should probably be content to take his virtues, as others
do, on trust. As it is, our paths lie separate; nor should
I have hazarded these remarks, dear sir, upon a man you
regard, but for your recommendation of Captain Hamlyn
to my preference. Even here, even in this house, from
which my poor friend Lady Burlington has been driven
into exile by the cunning of her husband's executor, I
have never before presumed to lift up my voice against
him. And to secure unanimity between us, I promise to
avoid all further mention of his name.”
“A kind and good resolution, my dear, and I thank
you heartily,” rejoined the Colonel. “However, as this
is the last time we're to have my friend on the spit, let's
give him another turn and roast him to rags.
Tell
me,
Nelly, like an honest soul as you are, have you any quarrel
against the banker beyond a woman's nat’ral unforgiv-
ingness, for his unbandsome usage of you, more years
ago than I care to remember?"
“No quarrel, sir. But I own I entertain strong pre-
judices against a man whose only object in life is the lucre
of gain."
* Then, my dear girl, you must dislike me. For rely
upon't that, for more than forty years of my life, my sole
object was to heap up lacs of rupees-obtain the best
interest for 'em-and--"
“But for what purpose, my dear sir ?” interrupted
Ellen. “What did you sacrifice towards the acquisition
of wealth, beyond your own time, convenience, and com-
fort ? Whose property did you put in peril by your spe-
culations,— whose substance did you waste by your trans-
actions ? To whom did you lend money on usurious in-
terest, facilitating the extravagance that wrought their
undoing, till the place of their forefathers knew them no
longer; and when were the riches, thus acquired, applied
to the scarcely less contemptible purpose of figuring
among the shifting throngs of London fashion? Show
me the object of Mr. Hamlyn's domestic affections, show

ambitions, in order to fulfil the narrow purposes of pa-
rental policy !"
“And how the plague do you know all this ?” cried the
Colonel.—“God knows such is not the picture I ever
painted you of Dean Park!"
" You forget,” replied his daughter-in-law, disappoint-
ing his expectations of having betrayed her into the
avowal of her intimacy with Henry Hamlyn, “ that I was
a whole week the inmate of Mr. and Mrs. Hamlyn, only
three
years ago.”
'All I can say is, then, that you made the most of
your time. However, as you mentioned before, Walter
was away with his regiment when you were at Dean;
and of his position as regards his father, you had no
means of judging. Of Walter, Hamlyn's as fond as ever
I was of e'er a child of my own.”
Mrs. Hamilton shook her head with an incredulous
smile.
“Well, well! Some day or other you'll be forced to
own there's nothing in nature Hamlyn knows how to
refuse his eldest son.
“Right, sir, his eldest son! Those two words con-
tain the secret of Walter Hamlyn's influence. The
banker is as incapable of a genuine, warm, disinterested
feeling as the captain of a slave-ship. And for my own
part-

sented to her by her father-in-law,

CHAPTER XV.
“The portion of the world which I at present
Have taken up to fill the following sermon,
Is one of which there's no description recent;
The reason why is easy to determine.
Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,
There is a sameness in its gems and ermine."-BYRON.
“By Jove, my dear Walter, I am beginning to twig what
Vernon was after, this morning, lounging along the
Ovington Road, in spite of an east wind that might have
cut the county jail asunder, and craning over the park-
palings of Burlington Manor !" said the Marquis to his
friend, as they rode back together to Dean Park. “What
a beautiful woman!"
“I told you you would lose your heart," replied Wal-
ter, with a forced smile.
“But I have not lost my heart! The widow is a splen-
did creature; but I should as soon think of falling in
love with Homer's ox-eyed Juno. I hate your
Medea-
like beauties, who look like the Tragic Muse walking in
silk attire; who ought to carry a dagger and bowl, instead
of a caudle-cup or crochet-needle. I should always
expect to find this beautiful Ellen of yours wandering
about Dartford Hall, in her sleep, like Lady Macbeth.
No, no! not the least fear of my trying to cut you out
with the widow."
“Nor of my resenting it, if you did !” replied Walter.
"I have no pretensions in that quarter."
“Why, I overheard the old gentleman whisper to my
Aunt Rotherwood, when I was last at Dean, that nothing
would suit him better than to have you for a son-in-law !"
“One don't marry a woman for the sake of pleasing
her father-in-law."
“Unless when the father-in-law happens to have four
hundred thousand pounds to make ducks and drakes of,
and is so capital a fellow as old Hamilton. Why, you
might buy out the Burlingtons, (their property's famously

embarrassed, I'm told,) and throw the manor into a
ring-fence with Dean Park.”
As another ring-fence must be accomplished at the
same time,” said Walter laughing, “ the prospect does
not charm me. I should never feel at my ease with such
a wife as Mrs. Hamilton."
“I see we agree about her in the main. To
my
taste a
woman cannot be too common-place; that is the common-
place of a genuine woman,-a feminine, gentle, loving,
Iovely edition of man. There are three leading points to
consider in a woman ;-heart, soul, body, (that's my in-
terpretation of the allegory of the three graces!) and not
a woman in a million unites perfection in the three.
A pretty woman with a good heart, therefore, constitutes
my irresistible. As an enemy to monopoly, I dispense
with the soul. So while I content myself with a warm-
hearted, pretty little wife, you shall have the handsome
widow, with her noble soul, and great estate."
“ I require something a little more refined than Bob
Hamilton's widow," replied Walter, with a supercilious
smile. "I should be very fastidious about the dress and
manners of wife.”
“ The mere dress and manners of a woman may be
fashioned into what you please."
“Not where there is a deficiency of natural taste.
You would never teach the beautiful Ellen to come
into a room with the instinctive elegance of Miss
Vernon."
Instinctive fiddlestick! Miss Vernon is made up of
what you call elegance. Mere surface !-Mere pretence!
She has not even the womanly dignity of Mrs. Hamilton;
far less the natural feeling and untaught grace of your
sister Lydia. By the way, Hamlyn, I bet you a pound
we receive an invitation to The Hyde before this time to-
morrow.
“I'll double the stake if you promise to accept when it
arrives,” said Walter.
“After engaging ourselves to the old Colonel, and
when I've set my heart on getting that Lion Hunt out
of him again ? I tried to inflict it upon our old Chaplain
at Dartford Hall. But I couldn't get his wig to stand on

end, as poor dear Lord and Lady Rotherwood's did,
while they were listening to Colonel Hamilton.”
“ Didn't I tell you so ?” cried the Marquis, when, that :
very evening, cards of invitation to the two young men
arrived from the Vernons. “I wish Alberic had staked
his chin on the park-palings of Burlington Manor, this
morning, before he carried back news of our arrival to
The Hyde! Blessed, however, be the said Manor among
the nations,-for it affords us an undeniable excuse to
these officious people.”
And with the utmost glee, Lord Dartford proceeded
to plead a previous engagement; while Walter could
scarcely repress a sigh at having to confess a similar dis-
qualification. It was almost too mortifying to have to
renounce a visit to The Hyde, in company with the Mar-
quis of Dartford, for the purpose of joining a humdrum
family dinner-party at Burlington Manor.
On the other hand, the excuse, of the young men was
received with as,ill a grace as Walter's was despatched.
“ Was ever anything so provoking!”, cried Lady
Vernon, tossing Lord Dartford's formal note into her
daughter's work-basket. “Engaged, they write word, to
those people at Burlington !—And after all the difficulty
I had to obtain your father's sanction to my inviting
young Hamlyn.”.
4 We must take Lord Dartford, as we can get him,"
replied Lycinda, coolly. "Love me, love my, banker,
or rather, my banker's son!”
“But we do not secure him the more for tolerating
his banker's, son.- We shall have to love his Colonel
Hamilton into the bargain!"
"Impossible, now the Middleburys are gone!: One
could bear him, diļuted with Middleburys. But i now,
papa would be obliged to have reçourse to his colchicum,
as he does against a flying gout!-- Heigho!"}

able matches seldom take place. But supposing (the
Dean Park damsel being out of the way) Lord Dartford
himself were to be attracted by this new beauty ?”.
“I am afraid we must make the sacrifice of calling at
Burlington!” observed Lady Vernon, after a long pause
for reflection.—“We ought to see what this Mrs. Hamil-
ton is like, and ascertain what she is about. If your father
will consent, we can drive there to-morrow. To say
the
truth, Alberic has been already at me on the subject.
He wants, I suspect, to see something of this Oriental
beauty before he goes to town.”
To Lady Vernon's surprise, she obtained from her lord
not only permission to proceed to Burlington Manor,
but, having proceeded thither without finding the beauty
at home, to invite her and Colonel Hamilton to dinner,
as a pretext for a new invitation to the young fox-hunters
at Dean Park.
“ This really exceeds belief!" was her ladyship’s excla-
mation, on receiving an answer from Mrs. Hamilton,
which, while opening, she had not an instant doubted
must be one of acceptance. “These people are engaged,
Lucinda, actually engaged; and I will give you a month
to guess to whom !”
Such people are scarcely worth the trouble. They
cannot come, and there is an end of the matter."
“By no means the end of it! They will boast to the
Elvastons, on arriving at Ormeau, of having refused in
their favour an invitation to The Hyde. Conceive what
a triumph for that impertinent Lady Cossington, who, I
have reason to know, fancies she cut you out with the
Marquis!”
“But what can take these people to Ormeau ?”
“ Alberic told me he noticed an intimacy, at covert,
between the Duke and that dreadful old Colonel. I con-
I fess I think it rather hard of Lord Vernon to have placed
impediments in the way of our intimacy with the only
family fit to associate with in this part of the county.
By their taking up these strange people, it is clear how
glad the Elvastons and Cossingtons would have been, had
your father seemed disposed to be sociable. They have
never invited even Alberic."

think we
“They could scarcely ask him without us."
“They will invite Captain Hamlyn with Lord Dart-
ford; though the Dean Park people are on the most
distant terms at Ormeau.”
“What a charming party they will have!” mused
Lucinda Vernon; "and what a winter have we brought
upon ourselves!
After all, mamma, don't you
might have made the six weeks seem a little less like
twelve, if we had been on pleasanter terms with our
neighbours ? My father dislikes the Duke of Elvaston
as a greater man than himself, and despises the Hamlyns
and Hamiltons as infinitely below him; and where are
we to find our level ? As the German emperor observed,
when requested by his nobles to exclude all but the
higher classes from the Augarten, “If people were obliged
to meet none but their equals, I must shut myself up in
the Imperial vault."
The invitation thus aggravating to Lucinda Vernon
produced, meanwhile, little emotion at Burlington, unless
as affording a satisfactory excuse for evading a visit to
The Hyde. Colonel Hamilton was averse, as he had
stated in apology to the Rotherwoods, to all large parties
of strangers; and the same plea would probably have
been again brought forward, but for his desire that Ellen
should enjoy something more suitable to her age than
the seclusion of his fireside.
Mrs. Hamilton, indeed, found more attraction in the
cheerful domesticity of the Manor than in all the excite-
ments of fashionable life. But she was not now in a
natural state of mind. She was mortified, restless, re-
sentful. She began to believe that some peculiar destiny
attached the Hamlyns to her path. From them came all
the bitterness of her life; from them her sole humilia-
tions. Richard Hamlyn had been the means of injuring
her fair fame, of bringing down the gray hairs of her
mother with sorrow to the grave, of developing in the
frame of her husband the germ of mortal infirmity; and
scarcely had she raised her head from the deep despair
produced by this series of calamities, when a being had
fallen in her way, endowed with the qualities most likely
to captivate her imagination and attach her heart:—and

228
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
alas! the only drawback to her hopes of renewed happiness
was, that the man so qualified by the highest endow-
ments to render his avowed preference a blessing, was
the son and successor of her enemy, Hamlyn the
banker.
All that in the first moment she had dreaded, had come
to pass. She had predicted Henry's strengthlessness
against the iron will, of such a father. She had an-
nounced to him that, on his return to England, he would
be compelled to adhere to a calling and career which she
was firmly resolved should never obtain an influence over
her wedded life. And thus compelled to abjure her hopes
of happiness, she was alone again, more alone, more
isolated than ever.
Against his father, as the origin of Henry's change of
feeling and projects, all her resentment was directed;
and thus embittered in her feelings against Dean Park,
even the affection she was beginning to entertain for her
kind 'father-in-law did not reconcile her to herself or to
Her mørtifications. She felt conscious of having too
easily bestowed her heart. She accused herself of faith-
lessness to the memory of the dead." Rebuked by the
supposed fickleñess' of Harry, she fancied that she was
only justly punished for having, after her vows of per-
petual widowhood, again inclined her ear to the blandish-
ments of affection.
Harassed by these, morbid self-recriminations, the
seclusion of Burlington ceased to charm. She hated to
find herself exposed to the curious examination of
Walter. She dreaded' lest he should describe, in his
letters to his brother, her swollen eyelids and tear-stained
cheeks, and it'was consequently à relief to be invited
from home while Captain Hamlyn was the inmate of
Dean Park.
For Lady, Vernon was premature in her supposition
that Walter and his friend would be asked to meet the
Hamiltons åt Ormeau. No such project had been a
moment entertained. The Elvastöns were somewhat old-
fashioned people, who, never having been on terms of
intimacy with either Richard Hamlyn or his father,
would have held it indecorous suddenly to establish a

229
familiarity with Walter, merely because he happened to
have their young friend, Lord Dartford, as his guest.
That the old gentleman for whom his Grace's friend,
Mr. Gratwycke of Gratwycke, had inspired him with
such sincere respect, should produce such additional re-
commendations as a country neighbour, as having for his
inmate a beautiful daughter-in-law, warmly commended
to the Marchioness of Cossington by her sister, Lady
Devereux, the wife of the English Minister at Florence,
was an unexpected delight to all parties; and in welcom-
ing Mrs. Hamilton to Ormeau, the ladies of the family
soon made her aware that all they had previously heard
in her favour fell far short of the impressions created by
herself.
In the large party assembled at the Duke of Elvaston's,
Colonel Hamilton, meanwhile, found himself far more in
his place than in the ultra-fashionable circle of The Hyde.
Lord Cossington, the heir-apparent, was little more than a
good-humoured country-gentleman, who devoted hialf the
year to his duties as a Member of Parliament, and the other
half to his pleasures as a sportsman; while the Duke himself
was the best of family-men, lord-lieutenants, and masters
of foxhounds; and Lady Cossington's father, Sir Robert
Maitland, who was fortunately staying in the house, was
not only an old General of Brigade, but had commanded in
India. With such companions, he was instantly at his
ease, without being too much at his ease. No boys like
Dartford to tempt him into buffoonery;—no solemn prigs,
like Lord Vernon, to taunt him into petulant reproof.
The solid but noble simplicity of the house enchanted
him. Ormeau exhibited neither the imposing historical
dignity of The Hyde, nor the modern elegance of Dean
Park or the Manor. It was a vast commodious mansion,
built by Inigo Jones, and furnished half a century ago,
with a degree of state and richness precluding all inter-
ference with its arrangements, till, at the close of an-
other half century or so, and another growth and fall of
timber, sentenced it to be furnished again. At Ormeau,
no nicknacks, no modern prettinesses, no fashionable
fauteuils. The huge Nankin vases on the pier-tables
had been bought in Queen Anne's time at the New

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Exchange or India House; the rich Japan screens, at the
toy-shop of Mrs. Chenevix. The last portrait of the
family-collection was the present Duke, when a boy, by
Hoppner. Not so much as one of the graceful and
emasculate pictures of Lawrence, to connect the square
roomy simplicity of the house with the flimsy elegancies
of the day. The Duchess deposited her crochet-work,
every night, in the huge, old-fashioned Tonbridge-ware
workbox presented to her by the Duke, on the birth of
one of her children twenty years before; and a little in-
laid ebony desk, which she had used as a bride, still
served her correspondence with her grandchildren.
The same stand-still order of things pervaded all the
habits and connexions of the house. The people with
whom the Duke and Duchess had associated in their
youth, were the associates of their age. They used the
same tradespeople, and entertained the same friends.
No running after new doctrines, or patent inventions.
Happy, respectable, dignified, they desired no changes
save such as were forced upon them by the will of Provi-
dence.
Much of this arose from the fact that the Elvastons
were not courtiers; that they had no rank to intrigue for,
-no children to establish. Their chief pleasure in life
consisted in that princely hospitality which affects no
display, but knows no intermission. Ormeau was lite-
rally what is called “ an open house.” For months toge-
ther, the family never sat down to dinner alone. As to
the hounds, in which the Duke was supposed to take
such delight, and which had obtained a proverbial name
in England, they were merely an item in the amusements
he felt bound to provide for his friends and neighbours.
Impossible for a man to have a more kindly or sociable
sense of the duties connected with the rank and fortune
he inherited.
But the service of plate on his Grace's table was what
the Vernons would have considered old-fashioned. There
was no splendid dessus de table, as at The Hyde; no
effigies of ancestors on war-horses of gold or gilt; nor
any of the little table fopperies dear to the dinner-givers
of the day. The sideboard of the very Hamlyns was

231
more showy. For the phrase "living in good style"
would have passed for a sad vulgarism at Ormeau.
The Colonel was as much delighted as amused to per-
ceive in what a different light men and things were con-
sidered by his new friends, and by the Vernons. At
Ormeau, the lights and shadows of life were broader, and
motives as clearly laid open as actions. All was fair and
above-board. Ņo subterranean story to the edifice, no
masked attic. The sun shone searchingly into the whole
family structure.
Among other peculiarities, he found that Hamlyn was
never depreciatingly alluded to, as by the Vernons, as a
man of business. In the eyes of the Duke of Elvaston
and his son, he was simply the Tory member for Bar-
thorpe, one of the ayes or noes of their party; whereas
the Ỹernons, great as they were in their own conceit and
that of the sexton of Braxham, represented at Ormeau
only the defeated Whig interest for Barthorpe.
Čolonel Hamilton had not been many minutes in the
house, before he found himself engaged in conversation
with Lord Cossington and his father-in-law, on the very
questions touching which he had been able to afford in-
formation to Lord Crawley. Aware that the Indian war
was about to be brought before parliament, the two pains-
taking Tory members were eager to make themselves
masters of the subject, from the fountain-head; little
suspecting that the Home Secretary himself had drained
it dry, and that any intelligence they might extort from
Colonel Hamilton, was only robbing their poor friend,
Crawley, of his parliamentary thunder.
A little later, and the Colonel was startled by an in-
quiry from the Duke himself, of whether he intended to
get into parliament ? In that house, it was held that a
man of fortune had no civil existence, unless he was in
the House. Nevertheless, the Duke's simple question of
“ Have you no thoughts, my dear sir, of getting into
parliament?” sounded in the old gentleman's ears much
as if he had said, “When are you likely to become Arch-
bishop of Canterbury?" He excused himself with a
laugh ; wondering how the Duke could possibly have
formed so exaggerated a notion of his consequence.

232
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“I tried to persuade our friend Mr. Gratwycke to
meet you here to-day," said the Duke, glancing round a
dinner-table of thirty people, and half afraid that the
party might contain too many fox-hunters to be altogether
agreeable to the veteran.
But I fancy he has given up
dining out. At least, he would not hear of honouring us
at Ormeau.”
The Colonel replied by a few words in confirmation of
the supposition that old Gratwycke had ceased to dine
out. But while puzzling himself to recollect whether it
were gout or chronic rheumatism, or simply that worst
of distempers, old age, by which poor Grat. was disabled,
his attention was taken by a question addressed by Lady
Cossington, beside whom he was seated, to his daughter-
in-law.
‘My sister Devereux wrote me word, last spring,”
said she, “ that all Rome was running to Gibson's atelier,
to see a magnificent bust for which you had sat to him,
-the most beautiful of his works. Have you brought
over a cast of it? My father is one of Gibson's earliest
patrons!”
“Lady Devereux was mistaken,” replied Mrs. Hamil-
ton, greatly embarrassed; but whether at having to give
such an explanation before a large party of strangers, or
because conscious of guilt in the Henry Hamlyn chapter,
the Colonel could not determine.--" Gibson had an order
for a group of Diana and Calisto, from Prince Dolgorucki,
--and fancied that my head might serve as a model for
his principal figure. I should scarcely, otherwise, have
had the presumption to sit for my bust, in the character
of a classical divinity,” added Mrs. Hamilton with a
smile.
“ You have told us the origin of the work,” replied
Lady Cossington. “But you must leave it for me to add
that this beautiful head, when finished, excited raptures
among the Italians; and that an enormous price was
offered for a copy of the bust, for the Glyptotheca, by
the King of Bavaria."
“All this is fine news to me, my dear!” cried the
Colonel, addressing his daughter-in-law. “Why didn't
you bring me home a copy? I'm no great judge of the

233
arts, but I'm a warm admirer of the beauties of nature;
even where my whole heart is not enlisted in the object,
as in the present instance.”
“I thought it might appear presumptuous to return
to England laden with such a very cumbrous trophy,"
replied Ellen. And she resumed her conversation with
her neighbour Lord Edward Sutton, a younger son of
the Duke. When next the Colonel was able to catch a
few words of their conversation, they were discussing the
exquisite statue just completed by Ğeefs, for the tomb of
Malibran at Lacken, which she had visited in her recent
transit through Brussels; and which, she contended, was
little more than an embodiment in marble of Murillo's
"Assumption of the Virgin."
In the evening, there was music; music which, to the
Italianized ears of Mrs. Hamilton, sounded strangely
enough. The Duke and his son were directors of the
Ancient Concert, and patrons of the Catch Club; and
Handel, Purcell, Locke, Scarlatti, Bach, still found favour
in their ears. The most modern music tolerated at
Ormeau was the graceful shallowness of Mozart, the
quips and quirks of Arne, or the tender monotony of
Cimarosa.
With Lady Cossington's admirable performance of
one or two of Handel's songs, Ellen was unfeignedly
delighted; but when the worthy Duke, his sons, and two
or three habitual stagers at Ormeau, betook themselves
to violins and violoncellos, and murdered a very learned
symphony of Salomon's, she recurred to her Neapolitan
evenings of Donizetti, Bellini, and Mercadante, with a
sigh that borrowed perhaps some sadness from the per-
sonal reminiscences with which they were connected.
Still, the evening was a pleasant one.
There was a
whist-table in an adjoining drawing-room, so as to form
no obstacle to the noise of the amateurs, or the conversa-
tion of the anti-melodists; among whom was the good
Colonel, who had beguiled Sir Robert Maitland from his
favourite Purcell, to talk over Cabool and Dost Mabomed.
The two veterans had established themselves in two old-
fashioned chairs, (which had probably been privy to
arguments touching the war of the Succession, and the

manæuvres of Dettingen,) to fight over the recent cam-
paign; and having this time found a friend to sympathize
in his indignation against the policy of the Earl of Clan-
sawney, the Colonel could do no less than reward his
new ally by bestowing the most patient attention on Sir
Robert's account of a system he was pursuing to reclaim
a vast tract of land in the Hebrides, with a view of pre-
venting the emigration of his Highland tenants.
“ I Hatter myself we have done wonders !” said the old
-soldier: “and for these two winters past, I have had the
comfort of knowing that sixty or eighty families had
warm beds to lie on, and plenty of good food in their
stomachs, who, before, had barely rags to cover them or
victuals to eat! One sleeps the sounder, Colonel Hamil.
ton, for such a consciousness. However, my agent warns
me that I must not go further than I can feel my way
back again. I have had four girls to portion off; and
my younger sons have a right to my hoardings. How-
ever, I have just received the welcome news of some
Bhurtpore prize-money; so there will be joy in Glen
Coil, and among the poor fellows at Usk. My daughter
Cossington is angry, because I talk of going up to town
to-morrow to look after it. But as I don't visit London
above once in five years, I have no banker there; and
my Edinburgh factors scarcely understand that sort of
thing. We are told that the way to have our boots
shine is to be our own shoeblacks; so I must even vex
poor Flora, and rail it to town.”
“I wish to mercy I'd known it t'other day, when I
was in Lon'on!” cried the Colonel. 66 'Twould have
been a pleasure to me to look in at the Indy House, or
War Office. A thousand pities to leave this pleasant
house and party, to do what any honest man might do
for you!"
Why, I should not be sorry to spare myself the
journey,” replied Sir Robert. "I have an old wound
that is apt to trouble me, if I bestir myself in cold
weather. However, business must be done."
By George! I think I could manage it,” cried the
Colonel, elated by the idea. “I've a right hand man,
not to say a bosom friend, one of the warmest men in the

city, who has managed such matters for me half a
hundred times before.
“Indeed?” cried Sir Robert Maitland, already ex-
panding into congeniality with his gray-headed brother
soldier.
“'Tis one o' the partners in Hamlyn's house; a fellow
with a head long enough for a Chancellor of the Exche-
quer.-At least I ought to say as much of one who
secures me five and a half per cent. for my money, in
times like these."
“Faith! a man worth inquiring after,” cried Sir
Robert. “I have long been in want of an adviser, who
could give me a notion, at a pinch, of the state of the
money-market. I'm guardian to two dear girls, the
orphans of an old Highland neighbour of mine, whose
small portions are none the worse for having abided in
my hands. But, as they are advancing towards woman-
hood, I sometimes reproach myself for not having done
better for them; and by a little management, and a
friend at court, I might perhaps still make their little
fortune rounder, before they are marriageable. Suppose,
Colonel, you give me a line to your wonder-working
financier.”
“I'll do better than that, if you'll allow me," replied
Hamilton. If you will make my excuses acceptable to
the Duke, I'll run up to town with you to-morrow, (I've
caught the habit o' gadding lately, I think ;) and we'll
go and say our say to Hamlyn, dine at the United
Service, -look in, if you like, at the pantomime,--and be
back again to dinner here the following day.”
“ You take away my breath, my dear sir!" replied Sir
Robert, not a little amused at his impetuosity. “Though
some years your junior, I'm not quite up to such electric
movements. However, throw me in another four-and-
twenty hours, and I'm your man. You are here, I
know, till Monday. Leave your charming daughter-in-
law, without fear or anxiety, to the care of Flora. I will
go and talk it over with Lady Cossington and the
Duchess.”
Colonel Hamilton was, in fact, far from regretting an
excuse for a second journey to town, without having to

her society, it did not altogether console him for the
loss of Mrs. Hamlyn's companionship. The loftiness
of character portrayed in the thoughtful brow of his
daughter-in-law. often repressed upon his lips those
familiar pleasantries which found an echo in Lydia's
girlish laugh, or smiling indulgence from her mother.
He wanted to see them both again. He wanted to con-
gratulate Mrs. Hamlyn on the submission of her son
Henry; and ascertain whether the young Cantab had
been more frank with her in his avowal of acquaintance
with Ellen, than Ellen to himself of her intimacy with
him.
Between a friendly visit to Cavendish Square, and a
business visit to Lombard Street, his excursion to the
metropolis was to be exclusively devoted to the Hamlyns.
CHAPTER XVI.
“ Such men are dangerous."-SHAKSPEARE.
RICHARD HAMLYN was, as we have seen, as absolute in
his firm as Richard Cour de Lion at the head of his
army. His nominal partner had not crossed the thres-
hold of the counting-house for years; and over his sub-
ordinates, the acting-partner exercised all the influence
arising from a character for the highest integrity, and
eminent ability as a man of business.
Whenever a hitch occurred in a transaction, the clerk
in perplexity had only to ask five minutes of the head of
the house, and all was unravelled; the funds in demand
were forthcoming, or the question in suspense decided.
Few bankers' clerks have leisure to inquire more curi-
ously into the affairs of their principals, than regards the
due payment of their salaries and replenishment of the
till. *All that the establishment in Lombard Street knew
or cared to know about those of the Hamlyns was, that
they were opulent people, whose wealth, aided by the
strong and speculative mind of Richard, was always on

the increase. The quill-drivers were accordingly as
happy, and self-sufficient, as becomes the clerkhood of a
thriving house.
Still, there was one among them, Spilsby, (the bald-
headed clerk, to whom the “widder o' John Darley, o'
Lemon-Tree Yard,” had been turned over by his master,)
who had a somewhat shrewder
eye
and more calculating
mind than the rest. To him there appeared to be pecu-
liarities in Mr. Hamlyn's way of keeping the accounts.
His mode of receiving the dividends and disposing of the
securities of the hợuse, was unsatisfactory to one who
conceived that twenty years of diligent service ought to
have placed him nearer on a level with the head or heart
of his employer.
His suspicions on these points once awakened, he had
no hesitation in profiting by the facilities afforded by his
situation, to pursue certain investigations to which he
had never hitherto given a moment's attention; or rather,
to which, had he been on more confidential terms with
his master, he would not have permitted himself to direct
his notice. But, on the first occasion of his placing his
finger on one of the suspected spots, Mr. Hamlyn had
taken him up so hạughtily, and imposed upon
him
vexatious and difficult an account to wind up, in order to
divert his attention, that Spilsby, instead of being grieved
that the firm should have occasion to condescend to arti-
fices and temporising, was maliciously resolved to pursue,
with silent perseverance, the substantiation of his sus-
picions.
But the mistrust of Richard Hamlyn was now awak-
ened. He had no doubt the head-clerk was more than
half aware that all was not well with the concern; and
his agony of anxiety to discover to what extent Spilsby
was enlightened, was torture. Every day, as he passed
through the banking-house, his first glance was directed
towards the bald-headed clerk. Every evening, when they
left off business, his first care when the keys were de-
livered to him, was to examine the eyes of Spilsby, to
discover whether anything had transpired; whether a
triumphant expression gleamed under his overhanging
brows, or whether despondency lurked in the corners of
SO

his mouth. A domestic traitor was a million of times
more to be dreaded than the Italian gossipings of Mrs.
Hamilton and Sir Roger Burlington's widow.
As is usual in such cases, the object of apprehension
soon became aware of his power. Though unable to
penetrate to the root of the matter, or surmise the exact
source of the irregularities which placed his employer in
fear of investigation, Spilsby saw that he had, at any
moment, the means of discomposing the self-possession
of Mr. Hamlyn, by meeting with a dry sneer his mani-
festo of the prosperous state of their assets. He had
only to fix his eye searchingly on his master,
when an-
nouncing a large deposit, to render Richard Hamlyn's
countenance infirm, and his answers incoherent.
Ć All this was anguish to the banker. His pride in his
Lombard Street autocracy was destroyed. He could not
stir, speak, write, move, but he fancied himself under the
scrutiny of Spilsby. During the private conversations
held in his parlour, he pictured to himself the ear of the
bald-headed clerk affixed to the keyhole; and when alone
with him, sometimes felt inspired with a gladiator-like
desire to spring upon him and crush out of the offender's.
breast the extent of his detections. His cool shrewdness,
nay,
his common powers of calculation, disappeared when
Spilsby was present. With the eye of the bald-headed
clerk fixed upon him, Hamlyn was no longer able to
combine the mysteries of Austrian Scrip and London
Omnium.-Othello's occupation was gone!
Meanwhile, every step ceded by the banker was a step-
of advance to Spilsby.
The life of the clerk became one.
of prying, groping, and surmise. At one moment, he
fancied he had discovered an immense deficit in the
Exchequer bills belonging to the firm. But the trap had
been laid for him by Hamlyn, in order to determine
whether he were or were not engaged in investigating
the private affairs of his employers; and no sooner had
he hinted with due deprecation his fears that Mr. Hamlyn
had been made the victim of some knavery, than the
banker quietly produced the missing securities, and knew
as well how to interpret the crest-fallen surprise of Spilsby,
as he had before interpreted his ill-disguised exultation.
.

239
From that moment, the bald-headed clerk became stern
in his purpose of detection. He saw that his suspicions
had been understood and frustrated by the superior cun-
ning of his employer; and from his knowledge of the
determined character of Hamlyn, was satisfied that he
would spare no pains to destroy the man who had dared
uplift the veil conceiling his gangrened member. It had,
in short, become a strife for life or death of character,
between the two. Though retaining towards each other
the external courtesies becoming their mutual position,
the looks of each spoke daggers. They often conversed
together smilingly of the weather, when each was tho-
roughly aware that the other would willingly denounce
him to the world, the law—the gaol—the hangman!
Such was the real position of a man who was enter-
taining Ambassadors and Home Secretaries at his table,
and commanding the cheers of the House of Commons !
It was after enduring, as he would have borne the
fangs of a rattlesnake, the furtive glances of Spilsby,
while passing through the counting-house to his private
room, at his usual early hour, one fine morning in
February, that Richard Hamlyn, on seating himself be-
fore his desk to examine a file of letters marked "private,"
and a series of slips sent in for inspection by the cashier,
sank back in his chair, incapable of giving his attention
to even the smallest of these documents; so deeply was
he moved by the venomous smile which had traversed the
face of Spilsby, on perceiving his entrance. He would
fain have issued orders at that moment for a gibbet fifty
cubits high, to exterminate the Mordecai of his abhor-
rence.
#
At that moment, a card was sent into him requiring
attention. Miss Creswell, for the last ten years the
governess of his daughters, and for the last six months
absent on leave with her family in Ireland, (at the express
entreaty of Colonel Hamilton,) having just arrived in
town by the mail, had thought proper to wait upon
her
patron in the city, believing the family to be still at Dean
Park, for instructions and greeting on her road; that is,
for rudiments of instruction in the financial line, in return
for all the geography and use of the globes she had

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
lavished on Lydia and Harriet. To accord the interview
requested, was no great sacrifice; for poor Miss Cres-
well had been one of the most passive instruments in his
hands. Regarding him as she did, as a politician little
inferior to Metternich, and a financier superior to all the
Rothschilds of all the capitals in Europe, Hamlyn was
aware that he could silence her by a word, and dismiss
her by a nod.
But he was unprepared for the changes effected in an
Irish nature by a renewal of the cordialities of an Irish
home. The poor dependant, so long refrigerated by the
proprieties of Cavendish Square, was thawed into a human
being. For six whole months, the governess had been
thinking and feeling for herself, till, at the last, “she
spake with her tongue.” Hamlyn would much rather
she would have held it, for he was ill prepared just then
to bear with idle talking; and the arrival of the fussy
little woman, excited by the. prospect of rejoining her
pupils, was like the buzzing of a gnat round the of
a traveller who is lying in ambush against the attack of
a lion.
“ The kindness you have always shown me, sir," said
she, after a long preamble about hoping to have merited
his esteem and good opinion by her conscientious devotion
to the care of the minds, morals, manners (geography
and the use of the globes included) of his daughters,
“ emboldens me to intrude upon your valuable time, with
a few questions relating to interests exclusively my own.
Mr. Joseph Creswell, my uncle, sir, (I fancy I have before
apprised you that I have an uncle an eminent legal practi-
tioner-that is, a thriving attorney, in Limerick,) has been
always in the habit of receiving and investing the amount
of my stipend, transmitted through your hands, sir, to
his credit in Latouche's bank. These little savings, sir,

Mrs. Hamlyn favours my prudent parsimony by her dis-

fessional phrase-maker.
“In short, sir," resumed 'Miss Creswell, perceiving
his impatience, I am now mistress of a sum little short

when it is considered that I into
your
niless young woman, with nothing to depend upon but
my own industry and abilities for my future support in
life. I ask your pardon for detaining you, sir, but I am
coming to the point. My uncle is advancing in years ;
and being about to dispose of his business, has suggested
it to me that (the various members of my family being
far better off than myself) I should sink the little capital
in question, in a life annuity.”
A very prudent suggestion," observed the banker,
still seeing before him, interposed between his eyes and
the little prim skinny face of Miss Creswell, the signifi-
cant smile and penetrating eyes of the clerk, so that the
phantom almost deprived him of his reasoning powers.
“ My uncle Joseph assures me, sir, that this sort of
business is more practicable—that is, more securely prac-
ticable in London; that a word from you
to
your man of
business would procure me some favourable occasion for
a safe investment; and, as a preparatory step to the pro-
position, he is desirous of remitting to you, for my benefit,
the whole amount of the small sum in question. If, there-
fore, I am not taking too great a liberty--"
“My dear madam, there is no service in my power to
render
you
which you have not the fullest right to claim
at my hands,” said Hamlyn, much relieved, and in his
blandest accents. “ Your inestimable services to my
daughters entitle you to my utmost gratitude.” Then,
as if satisfied that he had repaid her, sentence for sen-
tence, fudge by fudge, he drew from the blotting-book a
quire of official-looking note-paper, and indited to his
solicitor, Mr. Crossman, of the firm of Crossman and
Slack, of New Norfolk Street, a recommendation of the
bearer to his utmost consideration; begging that the pro-
fessional services rendered her might be placed to his own
account.
This act of munificence, if intended as a bouquet
d'adieu to curtail the negociations of the prolix wholesale
dealer in Lindley Murray, failed of effect. Under the
influence of relief from the oppression of six-and-eight-
pences to an amount untold, poor Miss Creswell burst

forth into benedictions and rejoicings still more dif.
fuse.
“ This generosity is no more than I might have ex-
pected, sir,” said she, “ from your father's son. My uncle
Joseph was saying to me the other day, (when congratu-
lating me on my good fortune in maintaining for so many
years my place in your establishment and good opinion,)
that, when he had occasion to visit the English metro-
polis on business thirty years ago, the name of Walter
Hamlyn was a by-word for worth, probity, and intelli-
gence. My poor uncle, sir, had once a money transac-
tion with the late Mr. Hamlyn, which left an ineffaceable
impression on his mind. Nearly about the same time he
had an audience of the late Mr. Pitt; and declares that,
of the two, Mr. Hamlyn of Lombard Street struck him
as by far the more competent man.”
Longer the governess would have spoken, and far longer
would Hamlyn have listened,--for praise bestowed upon
the name and memory of his father was in his ears as the
charming of the charmer. Filial reverence constituted
the sole redeeming virtue of his life; and no sooner did
Miss Creswell treat of the late banker as superior to Mr.
Pitt, than he began to regard her as superior to Miss
Edgworth. But at that moment, the face of Spilsby, the
real substantial Spilsby, peered into the room, requesting
to speak with Mr. Hamlyn.
There was nothing unusual in his voice or aspect. Yet
such was the nervous trepidation of Hamlyn under exist-
ing influences, that he seemed to bear in those simple
words a mysterious denunciation.
“Mrs. Hamlyn is expecting you every moment in
Cavendish Square, where I shall have the pleasure of
seeing you this evening,” said he, by way of dismissal to
the governess, who instantly gathered up her gloves,
velvet bag, and umbrella, for a hasty exit; on which
Spilsby no longer hesitated to acquaint the agitated
banker that “ Colonel Hamilton and another gentleman
were waiting for him without.”
Inexpressibly relieved, Hamlyn desired they might be
instantly shown in; then, ere there was time for the
execution of his order, hurried into the counting-house,

guinea.”
with outspread hands, to welcome the most highly-valued
of his friends, and receive an introduction to Sir Robert
Maitland. Another moment, and all three were seated
in the banker's room; where Colonel Hamilton, with his
usual aptitude for rushing in medias res, was already in
the midst of his Ormeau chapter of finance.
“ If you've heard lately from Watty, you didn't expect
to see me here to-day, I reckon, my dear Hamlyn ?”
cried he. “ You scarcely fancied me likely to leave my
quarters in a land overflowing with milk and honey, to
run up care-crazing to Lon'on, in order to break my head
against your strong boxes. But I've brought you a friend,
that is, a good customer, which is the best kind o'friend;
who wants you to put him in the way you put all the
rest of us, of finding five-and-twenty shillings in a
Richard Hamlyn, at present ignorant with whom he
had to deal in the stranger, and scarcely hoping that Pro-
vidence would supply him with a second open-handed old
soldier knowing no more of business than a cartouche-
box, felt rather nervous at the effect these preposterous
announcements might have on a new client; and accord-
ingly began inquiring after the health of Mrs. Robert
Hamilton, with a view of eliciting general particulars re-
specting his visitor.
The attempt prospered. While the stranger assisted
Colonel Hamilton in replying to the banker, by allusions
to his daughter, Lady Cossington, under whose care Mrs.
Hamilton was residing at Ormeau, Hamlyn was enchanted
to find that he had to deal with Sir Robert Maitland.
Few things would have gratified him more than the
notice of the Duke and Duchess of Elvaston, as a set-off
to the insolence of The Hyde. Under the fosterage of
Ormeau, he might look down upon Barlow of Alderham,
defy Gratwycke of Gratwycke, and stand his ground
against the united squirearchy of the county; and nothing
could be more desirable than the acquaintance of Sir
Robert, by obliging whom it was possible to secure the
gratitude of Lady Cossington.
Before Sir Robert had half explained his views, Hamlyn
was taking down notes of his Bhurtpoor claims; suggest-

ing a certificate of his life, a power of attorney to Hamlyn
and Co., and undertaking to manage the whole business
for him at the several periods at which the prize-money
was to be made payable.
The money-interests of Sir Robert's wards were con-
sidered with equal alacrity; the question of the reclaimed
lands with deferential interest.
“I perfectly remember the bill for the sea-enclosures
of Glen Coil being brought before the House," said Mr.
Hamlyn. “I was on the Committee for the Improve-
ment and Benefit of the Western Islands, in which the
melioration of the Maitland estates was brought under
the notice of Parliament. Your factor, a Mr. M'Causley,
a very superior man, was examined, and with infinite
credit both to himself and his employer.”
“God bless my soul! To think of your having been
present at poor M'Causley's examination, of which I have
since heard no end !” exclaimed Sir Robert.
- A most
curious coincidence, my dear Colonel Hamilton. How
little I imagined that your friend, Mr. Hamlyn, had ever
heard mention of my poor fellows at Glen Coil! Well,
to be sure, the ramifications of business, in this commer
cial country, are an astounding thing!"
“I remember deeply regretting at the time, my dear
sir," resumed the banker, with increased and increasing
suavitý, “ that I had not the honour of your acquaintance,
or that of some member of your family; in order to sug-
gest to you the feasibility and great advantage to all par-
ties of establishing at Usk a company not only for the
burning of kelp, but for the manufacture of iodine, on the
Königsburg system; a mineral the value and importance
of which is becoming daily more appreciated in Great
Britain and its Colonies.”
The two old soldiers were becoming every moment
more impressed by the legislative perspicacity of the
banker; who now proceeded to examine and cross-ex-
ansinė Sir Robert Maitland, 'touching the nature and
capabilities of his Highland property; till the veteran
began almost to fancy that the nest-egg he had been
keeping so snug for the benefit of the more impoverished
portion of his clan, was a golden egg at the least; and

that he should be a goose, unless he brooded with the
steadiest incubation,
Suddenly interrupting himself, as if recalling to mind,
on mention of Bhurtpoor, the interest experienced by the
two old soldiers in the affairs of India, he asked leave to
examine one of the letters marked “private and confi-
dential,” lying on his table when they arrived; the hand-
writing of which apprised him that it proceeded from an
individual occupying a place of trust in the India House,
to whom he paid large douceurs for priority of informa-
tion on the arrival of the mails; and lo! as he had ar-
dently hoped might prove the case, the letter in his hand
announced most important intelligence, only to be made
public in the evening papers. Colonel Hamilton and Sir
Robert were enraptured. They were of an age when
public news acquires threefold importance. Old men, in
proportion as their participation in worldly pleasures
slackens, seem to take double delight in tidings of sieges,
insurrections, earthquakes, treaties, or declarations of
war, as if conscious that their night is approaching“ when
no man shall work ;" that a time is at hand when even
the “ Times' shall manæuvre its columns for them in
vain.
Ere their glee had abated at hearing of a petty victory,
important only as likely to raise the price of consols from
747 to 741, Hamlyn expressed his desire that, instead of
returning into the country by the four o'clock train, they
would do him the honour of dining with him in Cavendish
Square. He expected a few friends, he said, --one or two
pleasant men. It would afford him pleasure to enable
these gentlemen to make an acquaintance so interesting
to all the friends of humanity, as that of Sir Robert
Maitland of Glen Coil.
The old General was almost bewitched by this flatter-
ing unction laid to his soul; and the Colonel desired no
better. For having arrived late the preceding evening,
they had as yet accomplished none of their projects ex-
cept dining at the club, and looking in at the pantomime;
and Colonel Hamilton was really anxious for a little pri-
vate conversation with the Banker's wife, ere he returned
to the country.


## p. 246 (#258) ############################################

246
THE BANKER'S WIFE:
The consent of both, therefore, was readily obtained.
Upon my life, I never met with a more sensible man!"
exclaimed Sir Robert, as they drove back to the West
End. “I may say, a very remarkable man. A son in
the Blues, I think you say?-Glad to hear it! One of
the finest regiments in the service. I like to see a man
who has been grinding down his life and spirits at the
desk, have the pluck to put his boy into a crack regi-
ment, to wear in the world the trophies of his father's
labours. I'm pleased at the thoughts of our dinner, my
dear Colonel. It has not often fallen in my way to be
behind the scenes of Mr. Hamlyn's order of society. I
shall be really glad to witness the domestic life of so im-
portant a body as the mercantile aristocracy of this com-
mercial metropolis."
Had Lord Dartford been present, he would certainly
have rewarded with a “hear, hear, hear!” this pompous
manifesto of the worthy old general, who had scarcely
an idea beyond the horizon of the Highlands. But even
the Marquis would have admitted it to be singular enough,
that, at half-past seven that day, Lieutenant-General Sir
Robert Maitland, G.C.B., should be accompanying to
dinner to a house he had never entered before, a friend
of whose existence he had been ignorant three days pre-
ceding. Such, however, was the familiarizing charm
attached to the bonhommie of Colonel Hamilton, that
nothing seemed strange in any arrangement in which he
was concerned.
They were the first to arrive; for the Colonel was
eager to shake hands with Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughter.
And while he entered eagerly into conversation with the
former, touching the news she was receiving from Cam-
bridge, Sir Robert good-naturedly replied to Lydia's in-
quiries concerning the Ormeau hounds, and the sport
enjoyed by her brother. She said nothing, of course, of
that enjoyed by the Marquis of Dartford. But as the
two young men were seldom a hundred yards asunder, it
was probable that all that was good for Peter, was also
good for Paul.
The banker, unprepared for the premature visit of his
new acquaintance, and having arrived late from the House

247
of Commons, to which he had made a hurried visit in
the interim, appeared in the drawing-room just as the
carriage of the succeeding comer drove to the door; and
Sir Robert, while shaking hands with his host, now trans-
formed from the seedy city drudge into the well-dressed
man of the world, fully anticipated, from the bustle, the
announcement of some brother-merchant, some Baring,
Robarts, Smith, Drummond, or Hoare. But, to his sur-
prise, the guest announced was one of the leading mem-
bers of the Tory Cabinet! Lord Crawley shortly fol-
lowed. Then came Flimflam, the reviewer, by way of
sippet to the ragout; then, the Earl of Harringford, a
nobleman who might have worn a Professor's gown
had
he not been born to a peer's robes; then, the Earl and
Countess of Rotherwood; and, lastly, two men rarely
seen out of the House of Commons-one, a learned lawyer,
whom Flimflam accused of living within the rules of the
Temple, and only being suffered to go out by a day-rule.
The G.C.B. was a little surprised. He could almost
have fancied himself in the lordly circle of Ormeau;
except that he soon heard the arts and sciences, and
politics which, though neither an art nor science, possess
the
power of crushing both, discussed under the banker's
roof with fifty times the connaissance de cause that ever
enlightened such arguments at the table of his grace of
Elvaston. Sir Robert Maitland began to discover that
the bankers of London were a race as distinct from the
bankers of the "gude toun," as Highlanders from Low-
landers.
Hamlyn, like all who have their way to make in society,
was a professed dinner-giver, and studied the vocation as
a science. On his refined board, the lordly.sirloin, so
relished by Ormeau and Sir Roger de Coverley, would
have been out of place. But his fish-course was the most
perfect in London; and the finest of the many fine gen-
tlemen who honoured Walter Hamlyn with their com-
pány had been heard to say, that, though there might be
finer plate and a vaster locale at D House, L
House, or B House, nothing could exceed the savoir
vivre of Cavendish Square.
Sir Robert, who was fond of a good glass of wine, fan-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
cied that the cellars at Ormeau afforded glorious occasion
for the indulgence of such a taste. But he now found
them overtrumped. Claret was no longer claret, nor
Burgundy Burgundy; so various was the nomenclature,
and so numerous the flavours under which each of his
favourite wines pretended to recommend itself to his
notice. He found that even Moselle was a house divided
against itself; and that Champagne, like man, in its time,
played many parts,
“ Wearing strange shapes, and bearing many names."
But the old man was not partial to innovations; and
the iced water handed round between the courses was, in
his opinion, a wretched substitute for the lime-punch of
his beloved Glasgow. When the dessert came on table,
the difficulty of deciding between the reality of the iced-
créam-fruits lying cold and deceptious on their napkins,
and the splendid prize-fruit fresh from the forcing houses
of Dean Park, put him out of conceit with the gigantic
strawberries and cherries before him.
Meanwhile, pleasant greetings had been exchanged be-
tween Lord Crawley and the old worthy of Burlington
Manor, who was not slow to claim the congratulations of
thé Home Secretary on the early verification of his pre-
dictions respecting the Indian war.
"I own I agreed with you in believing that the thing
was nearly over,” replied his lordship, gaily, “ seeing that
the newspaper-press had taken to designating it as in-
terminable.' Ever while you live, mistrust the cut-and-
dry phrases of leading articles, which are mere tubs for
the whale. For the last thirty years have these phrase-
merchants been accusing Russia of Machiavelian de-
signs!'-Russia, whose policy is the coarsest and most
peremptory in the world! As if, with Machiavelian de-
signs, she would not be shrewd enough to prevent their
becoming the fable of Europe."
“Perhaps," interposed Flimflam, “she may be aware
of the advantages of a bad reputation; as people circulate
reports at Christmas of typhus fever or small-pox in their
neighbourhood, to discourage the intended visits of their
friends."

Sir Robert gazed with amazement on the little man,
whom he alone of all the party did not recognise as a
professional diner-out, engaged, like the pyrotechnist of
à public fête, for the discharge of squibs and crackers;
and, taking Flimflam's assertion to the letter, expressed
a doubt that might have become the lips of my uncle
Toby, whether there existed a true-born Englishman
capable of inhospitality so flagrant. A glorious triumph
to the wit; who thereby earned an anecdote to be retailed
at his next dinner-party; embellishing, of course, the
General's remark with a broad Scotch accent, that would
have made the fortune of a low comedian at the Surrey
theatre.
Perceiving by this sortie, and the spirit with which it
was backed by Colonel Hamilton, that there were country-
gentlemen at table, Flimflam put forth the strength which
often failed him in company with men of Lord Crawley's
shrewdness and knowledge of the world, the pragmati-
cality of the clever Templar, apt to place people somewhat
unceremoniously in the witness-box, or the grave ratio-
cinaciousness of the Earl of Harringford, who reduced all
things, from a new mineral to a new pun, to analysis and
demonstration. Assuming his real part in the play,
which was that of an indifferent mezzotint copy of the
great Sydney Smith,-he proceeded to retail, in society not
frequented by the clerical wit, pungencies which told all
the better for the aplomb with which they were rehearsed
by the stepfather of the joke.
"I suppose you heard what Sydney Smith said the
other night ?" was, however, as fair an indication of the
source of his bon mots, as the name of Cousins or Doo in-
scribed on the corner of one of Lawrence's or Wilkie's
pictures; and people like the Rotherwoods were as
thankful to the dapper little gentleman who procured
them an opportunity of hearing what“Mr. Smith had said
so amusingly about the missionaries of Hong Kong," as to
the martyr who sleeps in a leathern suit on tree-tops in
Mexico, among reptiles and beasts of prey, to provide
orchideous plants for the conservatories of lords and ladies.
All this time, while the two old soldiers sat listening
open-mouthed to the facetiæ of what they conceived to

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
no
be the last new edition of Joseph Miller, Hamlyn was
noting, unnoticed, the countenance of Lord Crawley ;
from whom, for the first time in the course of their ac-
quaintance, he had written the preceding day to ask a
favour.
From his long experience in deciphering the hierogly-
phics of the human countenance, the banker fancied he
should be able to foresee as readily as the teller of a divi-
sion the “ay” or of the official, in the courtly
smile assumed to cover a negative, or the unconcern
purporting to modify the dignity of conferring a favour.
Nevertheless, the practised Crawley ate, drank, and
digested, with a face as inexpressive as a whited wall;
and Lord Harringford might as well have attempted to
work a problem upon the constellated dried cherries on
the Nesselrode pudding before him, as the anxious postu-
lant to infer the success of his suit, from the blank
countenance of the great man.
Nor were matters more lucent when the ladies and
servants disappeared. The circle narrowed, and the jokes
grew broader. The two officials whispered together,
the Templar grew pungent as a summer raddish,—the
Earl of Harringford snored,-and Colonel Hamilton and
Sir Robert Maitland mutually whispered their regrets
that the real Simon Pure, the editio princeps of Sydney
Smith, had not been laid before them that day, instead of
the flimsy fellow who represented him much as the fiddle
and harp mangling one of Rossini's overtures for the dis-
traction of the passengers in a Ramsgate steamer, repre-
sent the orchestra of Her Majesty's Theatre. Still,
Hamlyn made no advance in his discoveries; and, with
his usual tact, exerted himself to prose plausibly through
a long series of social truisms and political surfaceisms,
as a man is privileged to do at the head of his own table,
trusting that, while assisting the digestion of the Earl of
Rotherwood by the emission of a dulcet morality such as
forwarded his lordship’s evening nap at Rotherwood
Castle under the auspices of his domestic chaplain, he
might also catch Lord Crawley napping.
There's a head to settle å frontier treaty for you!”
murmured Colonel Hamilton to Sir Robert, who had

been tasting a fifth kind of claret while nodding his
applause.
« There's a conscience to entrust with our lives and
liberties, our Consols and Exchequer-bills !” was the re-
joinder, or thereabouts, of the G.C.B. And by the time
they reached the drawing-room, both were in that mood of
ineffable content produced by the digestion of a dinner too
perfect to engender remorse of the stomach, and seasoned
by mildest of sophistry. At that moment, had either of
them had in his pocket twenty thousand lacs of rupees
for investment, he would have placed it in the hands of
Hamlyn the banker with as little hesitation as in those
of St. Paul.
By the peculiar manner in which Lord Crawley looked
about him as they traversed the hall to go to coffee, as if
to ascertain that his great-coat and servants were in at-
tendance for immediate departure as soon as he should
have made his bow to his hostess, Hamlyn perceived that
there was some serious call on the time of the Cabinet
Minister; that he was engaged either to the President of
the Council, or the Opera. Hoping to nail him as they
proceeded together up-stairs, while Hamilton and Mait-
land paused to admire a stand of exotics on the landing-
place, he attempted to enter into conversation.
“ Flimflam was not so good as usual to-day!” said he,
in the apologetic tone in which a host alludes to a bottle
of corked claret. “Flimflam never tells in a party where
he has no confederate. He requires a chum, as a juggler
requires his clown. Flimflam cannot carry off a party
on his single shoulders.”
“I believe he is a clever man, in his way,” observed
Lord Crawley, vacantly-attaching, no further import-
ance to a man so politically uninfluential, than to
Ramsay the butler. Then, as they entered the drawing-
room together, he drew off his host towards an inner
boudoir, where a fire was blazing, and the caricatures of
H. B. lying scattered, for the recreation of loungers;
aware that a tête-à-tête in which one of the tétes is that
of a Secretary of State, is as sacred from intrusion as that
of a pair of engaged lovers.
“ need not tell you, my dear Hamlyn," said he, open-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
ing the palaver in an off-hand way, "that I gave imme-
diate attention to your letter of yesterday. I am half
inclined to quarrel with you, by the way, that the first
thing you have ever asked me to attempt for you should
lie so thoroughly out of my department as to afford any
possibility of failure. Consulships, you are well aware,
fie at the disposal of the Foreign Office. Nevertheless,
as you justly observed in your note, my interference
might exercise a secondary influence; and I therefore
lost no time in addressing myself to my colleague. I
must remind you, however, that we are obliged to observe
excessive punctilio in this sort of interference, or the
patronage of no office would be sacred.”
“ Believe me I am most sensible of your kindness,” re-
plied Hamlyn; satisfied that a consulship asked for by
her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Depart-
ment, was as good as granted.
“Not at all, my dear sir. You have claims on the
courtesy of Government, independent of the ties of
private friendship which unite you with myself,” replied
Lord Crawley, with a becoming recollection of the hun-
dreds of braces of pheasants he had bagged at Dean Park.
“As regards my own feelings, I need not tell you that
any request of yours in my power to grant, would be
granted unconditionally. But, as I said before, this thing
is out of my department."
" The application, then, was unsuccessful P” inquired
Hamlyn, in a low voice, feeling as if all the claret and
grapes he had been swallowing were suddenly acidulating
within him.
“Unsuccessful is scarcely the word. Encumbered as
are the hands of Her Majesty's Government at the
present moment, by long existing pledges and serious
obligations--"
Hamlyn's hopes sunk lower and lower at this plausible
preamble. Already, he fore-felt in his eyes the dust
about to be thrown into them.
“Encumbered as we are, I say, and forced as it were
to divide by a miracle five barley-loaves and three small
fishes among a hungering multitude, it becomes impossi-
ble for us to consider our leanings and inclinations.

253
When reminded of this by my friend the Foreign Secre-
tary, I did not fail to put forward your claims, as a zeal-
ous friend of the administration, as well as the least im-
portunate of our parliamentary supporters. I leave you
to guess his reply."
"I fear I am too little skilled in the mysteries of
patronage to conjecture,” observed the crestfallen banker.
Nay, all was as straightforward as if issuing from
your Temple of the Mammon of Unrighteousness in
Threadneedle Street. His Lordship's policy is as prac-
tical as Lear's-nothing for nothing! In one word,
he told me that it was reported we had everything to fear
from you on the Foreign Securities' question; and that,
in the event of your petition being granted, we must
have your pledge to support this, as well as all other
government measures."
Richard Hamlyn was conscious of an involuntary
clenching of his hands as he listened. The measure in
question (to which, with the fear of a Treasury prosecu-
tion before our eyes, a fictitious name and nature has
been assigned) was one of his political pets, the only
point on which he differed from the views of the party
with which he was as closely amalgamated as a Smyrna
fig to the fellow-figs in its drum,- because the only
political question that happened to trench upon his
private interests. He had cultivated it as a favourite
plant; watered it, pruned it, supported it with sticks.
Whenever it was before the House, he felt inspired; and
it was in the maintenance of this darling measure, that
he had indulged in those ebullitions of petulance to which
allusion was formerly made. In city-meetings, composed
of the friends of its policy, he was invariably called into
the Chair. To abjure, to recant, was as for Peter to deny
his Master; and with a sense of magnanimity he had not
experienced since he last figured on the Barthorpe hust-
ings as “Hamlyn, the friend of the Poor!” he prepared
to reject the flagitious proposition of government, and
renounce the Consulship of Tangier!-
At that moment, however, there rose clear and distinct
before him,--a bald head, the head of Spilsby, the clerk;
producing in that warm and elegant chamber a far more

glacial effect than the Death's-head at an Egyptian feast;
and to rid himself of such a presence, he felt ready to
renounce all that Faustus is said to have signed away, by
post-obit, to the Evil One!-
Another minute, and the bargain was struck. Virtue
was gone out of the banker; and the disposal of one of
her Majesty's richest Consulships in his hands.
“This office is, I presume, to be filled by some near
relative of your own, since you attach so much import-
ance to it?" said Lord Crawley, inwardly chuckling, as
Dalilah may have done while beholding the strength of
her victim cut off, and lying scattered at her feet.
“It is for one who has served me and my family faith-
fully for a period of twenty years,” responded the banker;
and Crawley, whose word was pledged, whether this
faithful servant were Ramsay the banker's butler or one
of his coach-horses, felt a little anxious for further in-
formation.
Though unaddicted to the weakness of astonishment,
he was greatly surprised to find Hamlyn of Lombard
Street so humane of disposition as to be content to sacrifice
the valuable services of the faithfullest head-clerk in the
universe, to the desire of securing his independence; nor
could he help surmising that the future Consul must have
rendered inordinate services to the banker, to suggest
such excess of self-sacrifice!
The equivalent, however, whatever it might be, was no
affair of his; and with the blandest urbanity he now took
leave; while the two old soldiers, who had been watch-
ing the interview through the folding-doors, could scarcely
restrain their reverence for the banker whose opinion
Lord Crawley had evidently been sifting with deference,
and whom they half surmised had received offers of office,
the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, for aught they
knew to the contrary!-
That night seemed the longest to Richard Hamlyn he
had ever spent, save the 16th of December every year,
ere he was sixteen
age ;
when breaking up
for
the Christmas holidays was dependent on the day-break
of the morrow.
Ere the cheeping of those callow black-
birds, the London chimney-sweeps, had commenced for

the day, he was astir. Vainly did poor Miss Creswell
apply for a few minutes' interview, prior to his departure
from home; in order to acquaint him with the result of
her conference the preceding day. Unable to express to
the decorous governess the wish that rose to his lips, con-
cerning a journey he sincerely wished to send her at that
moment, he contented himself with graciously begging to
postpone their interview till the evening.
Never had he felt the throng and pressure of Fleet
Street so importunate as that morning. His breath was
oppressed,- his heart almost ceased to beat under the
stifling greatness of his emotions; and when at length he
stopped before his door in Lombard Street, the groom,
accustomed to deposit him there three-hundred-and-eleven
days in the year, could scarcely understand how it hap-
pened that the banker omitted his usual parting phrase
of, “ You will be here at half-past four.”
Nevertheless, Richard Hamlyn contrived to subdue his
outward mien to a degree of decency becoming the occa-
sion. He entered the compting-house with the same air
he would have assumed in entering the Ovington In-
firmary, or Ovington Church on Christmas Day, or the
library of Ormeau at any time of the year; mild,-
humble,–Christianlike.
Instead of waiting for the ordinary torturing knock
and intrusion of the bald-headed clerk, he coolly de-
sired one of the quill-driving subs who brought in his
standish duly replenished, to acquaint Mr. Spilsby he
wished to speak with him; and when the enemy appeared
and found the banker standing on the hearth-rug, with
his coat-tails upturned,-master of himself and the situa-
tion,-he felt sure that some lucky stock-dealing stroke
had righted the house; and that the firm of Hamlyn and
Co. was solvent as that of Coutts !
"I have sent for you, Spilsby," said Richard Hamlyn,
“ to communicate a piece of agreeable news; which the
interest you have created in my mind by twenty years of
faithful service, renders doubly gratifying to my feelings.”
Spilsby, who had an infirm cousin in the North, from
whom he had considerable expectations, entertaining
little doubt that Samuel Spilsby of Newcastle was gone

256
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
for ever, leaving his shares in the Wallsend Company to
his nearest of kin, sank into a chair.
“I am aware,” pursued Hamlyn, in a tone that would
have done honour to the Treasurer of the Philanthropic
Institution addressing the patrons of the charity at an
annual dinner,—“I am aware, my dear Spilsby, that
you have a large family, and that, in these times, a large
family is not maintained for nothing. I do not mean to
call your salary in this house, nothing; but four hundred
per annum scarcely affords the means of effecting those
insurances on your life essential to the well-being of those
who are to succeed you.”
Poor Spilsby felt himself revive painfully. His cousin
was not dead! There would be no occasion for all this
fudge on the part of the head of the firm, to announce
that he had come into a family property.
“In short, Spilsby," resumed Richard Hamlyn, “having
taken all these things into my consideration, and having, I
am happy to say, some trifling claim upon the good offices
of government, I have been so fortunate as to obtain for you
a more lucrative as well as more honourable employment,
than that of a banking-house clerk. On Saturday night,
you will be gazetted Her Majesty's consul at Tangier."
Less practised than the banker in the art of simulation,
the astonished clerk instantly started to his feet.
Nominated without solicitation, to a Consulship,-a
Consulship that would remove him so far from home;-
that would exile him from his native country!
“The salary is between eight and nine hundred a-year,"
added Hamlyn. “The climate salubrious,—the duty
light."
“ Eight hundred a-year?" mused Spilsby. “Squander
his parliamentary interest to the tune of eight hundred
a-year? The mystery, whatever it be, is worth thirty
thousand at the least farthing!"
"I am infinitely indebted to you, Mr. Hamlyn," he
resumed aloud, rising respectfully, to resume his attitude
of clerkly subordination; “indebted to you to a degree
my poor heart might vainly attempt to express. Your
most unmerited goodness, sir, is a thing which I trust
will never be forgotten by me or mine. But-

At this ominous conjunction, Richard Hamlyn gasped
for breath.
“My family prospects are of a more cheering nature
than you have the means of knowing. I have relations
well to do in the world, sir, whose good-will is mainly
supported by knowing me to occupy a situation of trust
in one of the first establishments in the moneyed world;
and who would resent my leaving England. I have no
ambition to become independent. I am content to live
and die, sir, attached to the house."
Almost spasmodically, the banker wiped from his fore-
head a rising dew; and Spilsby, seeing his advantage,
peered out significantly from his overhanging eyebrows,
as he proceeded :-
“So long as the firm exists, Mr. Hamlyn, so long as the
kouse remains open, I hope to be found at my post. I
can never be happier than as the faithful servant of the
most upright and honourable of masters. - Permit me,
therefore, without hesitation, respectfully to decline' the
appointment you have thus generously procured me upon
the coast of Africa !”
It was now the turn of Richard Hamlyn to sink un-
manned into a chair.

HARASSED as Mrs. Hamlyn had been at the moment of
her return to town, her well-regulated mind became
gradually restored to composure on perceiving the self-
possession of her husband, his unmitigated attention to
his business and parliamentary duties. The crisis, from
whatever cause it might have arisen, was evidently
past.
Thus cheered, the methodical regularity of her house-
hold soothed her spirits as by the measured rocking of a

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
lullaby. It seemed absurd to look out for breakers when
launched on so smooth a sea, and under a sky so propitious..
The kindness with which Lydia was welcomed into
society, filled her mother with gratitude to the
gay
circles
she had hitherto regarded with indifference; and, on the
other hand, the banker's wife found herself the object of
a new species of consideration as mother of the most
popular debutante of the season.
For the indulgence of her anxiety concerning the differ-
ences existing between Henry and his father, she had
little leisure. Day after day, evening after evening, she
had engagements to keep. No fashionable party was
considered complete without the presence of the beautiful
Miss Hamlyn, whose sweet and intelligent countenance
seemed to brighten every circle she entered.
Richard Hamlyn's desire that his family should main-
tain a distinguished place in the fashionable world, was
consequently gratified. All he ambitioned was, that his
wife and daughter should reflect credit upon the firm of
Hamlyn and Co., and assist in the maintenance of that
castle in the air which, through life, he had been labouring
to uphold. That they would do more, he did not desire.
Like most people whose attention is absorbed by a vital
interest, he had no collateral projects. All he had cared
for during the last five-and-twenty years, was to preserve
the credit of a ruined family, and save from the Gazette,
by fair means or foul, an insolvent firm; and engrossed
by the fatal nature of his expedients, had not leisure to
indulge in any complication of ambitions. It had never
struck him, for instance, while labouring to gild the pros-
pects of the future Hamlyns of Dean Park, that the name
might derive lustre from the brilliant marriage of his
daughter.
The only brother of the banker was a dignitary of the
Church, who rarely quitted his preferment in the county
of Durham. His sisters were married in a moderate
sphere of life,--the one residing also in the North, the
other in Devonshire; and, accustomed to regard the
alliances of his family with unexulting eyes, he had
always settled it with himself that Lydia and Harriet
would become the wives of country-gentlemen, or mercan-

259
tile men. To aspire beyond this, would have been at
variance with his plans.
When, therefore, soon after Lydia's début, he found
her attract to his house a higher order of guests than
had yet sought his acquaintance, he was more startled
than pleased. Absorbed by personal cares of the most
poignant nature, he had not yet found time to accom-
modate his views to the new position of his family, when
the startling intelligence was communicated by his wife,
that the Marquis of Dartford requested permission to pay
his addresses to their daughter!
The proposals were made in the most flattering manner.
A letter from the Marchioness was delivered by her
sister, Lady Rotherwood, to the banker's wife, fully
authorizing the views of her son; by whom her consent
had been applied for at the moment of her recent con-
valescence. All she requested, in the event of his being
so fortunate as to make himself acceptable to so charm-
ing a girl, was that the marriage should be delayed till
the expiration of Gerald's minority, early in the month
of June.
It was one night, on returning from a brilliant party,
and learning that Mr. Hamlyn was writing in his study,
that the intelligence was communicated by his wife.
Ramsay informed me you were still up,” said Mrs.
Hamlyn, hesitating whether to enter the room, on per-
ceiving that the banker's table was covered with
papers.
“I have only been half an hour returned from the
House, and have letters to answer," was his morose reply,
for none of his family were permitted to intrude upon
his
retirement, unless by special invitation. When therefore
he saw his wife, unabashed by his abruptness, quietly
take her seat by the fireside, in spite of the lateness of
the hour, he felt that something important must have
transpired; and dreaded lest, through the indiscretion of
Lord Crawley and gossiping of Lady Rotherwood, some-
thing might have reached his wife of his solicitations in
Spilsby's favour.
This surmise was strengthened by the first words
uttered by Mrs. Hamlyn.
" You have perhaps been apprised by Lord Crawley,"
66

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;

said she, " of the startling circumstance for which Lady
Rotherwood this morning prepared me?"
The banker was nerving himself to rebut, by harsh re-
proof, any inquiries his wife might be disposed to hazard,
when Mrs. Hamlyn proceeded to unfold her pleasant
intelligence, which struck with double force upon the
father's mind, after the humiliating panic by which it had
been preceded.
All that was at present required of him was to sanction
the familiar visits at his house, of the noble suitor; Mrs.
Hamlyn having conditioned for a month's delay, before
Lydia gave a definite answer on a question so important.
Scarcely another father in London, however, but, under
sạch circumstances, would have sought an interview with
his child; to congratulate her on her brilliant prospects,
and fold her tenderly to his heart. But Hamlyn, with his
wonted circumspection, contented himself with express-
ing to his wife his conviction that so “ capital a match”
would in the sequel be circumvented by the interference
of prudent friends; or by the natural fickleness of a boy
of Lord Dartford's age, for whose hand all the chaperons
in London were maneuvring.
“Do not let Lydia set her heart upon it!" was his
parting counsel, as his wife prepared to retire for the
night. “Something will probably occur to blight so
brilļiant a prospect. The thing is too preposterous,—too
utterly out of our sphere, and will raise up against us
endless enemies and animosities. Tell her, however, that
nothing shall be neglected to forward her interests."
Alas! it was not on her “interests” that Lydia was
intent. At such a crisis, the young girl wished
herself folded for the first time with paternal warmth to
the heart of her father; and deep was Mrs. Hamlyn's
mortification at having to return to the dressing-room,
where her daughter was awaiting her, unaccompanied by
him who, as the head of the family, ought to have been
its leading influence.
“Your father, dearest, gives his gratified consent,"
said Mrs. Hamlyn, in a subdued voice, unwilling to damp
the joy of the agitated girl by a more explicit transmission
of his message.

--
“But he is pleased with Lord Dartford's conduct ?”
persisted Lydia. "He feels as you do, that nothing can
have been more feeling or considerate ?"
“Your father expressed the highest opinion of him.
As Walter's friend, Lord Dartford has long excited his
interest. To-morrow, at dinner, they will meet, and
everything be mutually agreed upon.
“To-morrow, at dinner!" thought Lydia, sadly. “Not
one day's respite from business, to afford his countenance
and support to his daughter.”
Measured, however, as was the banker's avowal of
triumph, in presence of his wife, no sooner had he bolted
himself into the privacy of his study, than he gave way
to the wildest emotion. His daughter a peeress! The
grand-daughter of Walter Hamlyn 'the banker a mär-
chioness, in the enjoyment of forty thousand 'a-year, with
all the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious tank!
What would the Vernons say; and how, henceforward,
could the Ormeau family preserve their frigid distance ?
“If my poor father had but lived to see this day !"
naturally escaped him. But that inauspicious name
recalled him to the realities of life; and an involuntary
shudder ran through his frame as he reflected on all he
had to fear during the interval to elapse before this
splendid alliance was accomplished.
A touch, a word, a whisper might at any moment
destroy the glittering fabric of his fortunes, and over-
whelm under its ruins himself and all who bore his
name!
In the anguish of his heart, he cursed the rashness
which had induced him to make his recent overtures to
government, ere, certain of Spilsby's acquiescence.
“This clerk of yours, my dear Hamlýn, must have a
prodigious idea of the advantages to be derived from
sticking to your strong box!” Lord Crawley had observed
with a smile, on learning that the Consulship was de-
clined. “ Your patronage carries more weight with it
than ours. However, having, at your instigation, placed
my paw upon this little windfall, I shall clench it for one
of my nephews; a poor Honourable with a wife and half
a dozen children, who is not quite so pampered as this


## p. 262 (#274) ############################################

262
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Mr. Spilsby of yours, by the crumbs that fall from the
table of Hamlyn and Co.!”
Every syllable of this, though uttered at random, spoke
daggers to the diseased mind of the banker. Imputing
undue significance to the idle banter of a man whose suc-
cess in political life was mainly owing to the pungent
recklessness of his parliamentary eloquence, Hamlyn
trembled to reflect that he whose suspicions were thus
unluckily awakened, was uncle to the Marquis of Dart-
ford !
On the morrow, however, he had so far recovered his
presence of mind, as to bear his part, in the aptest man-
ner, in the ceremonial of welcoming Lord Dartford in the
character of a son-in-law; and the young lovers, already
gratified by the affectionate warmth of Mrs. Hamlyn and
triumphant joy of Walter, had no fault to find with the
calm, dignified approval of the banker.
The establishment in Cavendish Square seemed startled
into new life by this sudden glorification. Already, Lady
Rotherwood had confided it in strictest secrecy to a suf-
ficient number of intimate friends to bruit the report
through all the clubs of the West End; while Captain
Hamlyn was, on his part, too deeply interested that it
should reach the ears of Lord and Lady Vernon, to oppose
a very firm contradiction to the rumour. That it did
reach their ears, a very few days sufficed to demonstrate.
Apprehensive that their own disappointment might ex-
pose them to ridicule, Lucinda and her mother hastened
with their congratulations to Cavendish Square; as if of
opinion that they could not efface by too prompt an assi-
duity their previous slights to Dean Park.
No sooner, however, was it generally understood that
an engagement subsisted between “the lovely and accom-
plished Miss Hamlyn” and the young Marquis, of Dart-
ford, than the chaperons of Almack's began to whisper
among themselves that poor Lord Dartford had been
shamefully taken in—that he was not of age-a boy-a
child,—while the Hamlyns were artful people, who from
his boyhood had been trying to entrap him, through the
influence of their st son over the poor lad,-first as
his Eton fag, afterwards as his cornet in the Blues. The

263
whole was a cunning scheme, devised by these presuming
parvenus.'
Such was the version of the affair sanctioned every-
where by the Vernons. Lord Vernon bewailed himself
at Brookes's as the most unfortunate of mankind; not
because his wife was again unsuccessful in netting a
marquis, but because this disproportioned alliance of the
Hamlyns would thrust them forward so offensively in the
county, that he should be no longer able to overlook the
vicinity of Dean Park to The Hyde.
But in spite of their envy, hatred, and malice, all was
happiness in Cavendish Square ;-on all sides, congratu-
lations, gifts, flowers, affectionate welcomes, and triumph-
ant joy. Mrs. Hamlyn, instead of pretending to lament
the premature settlement in life that was to deprive her
of her daughter's company, felt inexpressibly relieved by
the certainty of placing her Lydia in a happy home.
Walter was wild with delight at a connexion pur-
chased by no degrading sacrifices, yet securing at once
happiness to his sister and support to his own projects
of alliance; and Henry wrote from Cambridge an ex-
pression of melancholy delight that at least one member
of his family was fated to be happy.
Even poor Miss Creswell lost sight of her annuity, in
the expectation of beholding her beloved pupil a Mar-
chioness; and when Lydia's letter, claiming Colonel
Hamilton's good wishes, reached Burlington Manor, ac-
companied by a few lines from Lord Dartford, containing
arch allusions to the sledge-party, and a certain dried
blossom of Arabian jessamine, which was to exist as long
as he lived, in his pocket-book, and had originally been
presented to him, in the conservatory at Burlington, —
the good old Colonel not only shed tears of joy, but pro-
tested that the moment he had got through his engage-
ments to his neighbours at the Vicarage, Ormeau, and
Gratwycke House, he would hurry up to town to bestow
his blessing upon the kind-hearted girl, who was dear to
him as a daughter.
"You must bear me company, Ellen,” said he,“ and
make my little Lydia's acquaintance. I have always
been in hopes you would come to love each other as

sisters. Though you weren't over and above civil to the
young Captain when he was at Dean, you had so far an
excuse, that whatever attention you might show to him,
you were obliged to extend to the Marquis. However,
'tis some comfort, at all events, that you agree with me
in thinking young Dar'ford a trump,--a fine, free-hearted
young fellow,-gentleman to the backbone. So the sooner
we go and offer our congratulations to poor dear Mrs.
Hamlyn, who won't know whether to laugh or cry at
losing such a daughter, -bless 'em both,—the better. I
love to see young folks a-courting, when there's nothing
likely to thwart their courtship; and as you won't afford
me the sight of any billing and cooing by my own fire-
side, I must go and make the best use of my spectacles
at my friend Hamlyn's!"
Opportunity for observation was certainly not wanting;
for every day, punctual to the moment sanctioned by
Mrs. Hamlyn, Lord Dartford's brougham drove to the
and it would have been hard to decide which looked
the brighter, gayer, or sweeter,—the young lover, or the
bouquet with which he came provided. Till the hour
arrived for Lydia to ride with her brother Walter, or
drive with her mother, Lord Dartford remained, listening
to her sweet singing or sweeter conversation. Dinner-
time brought hiin again, when no engagements inter-
fered, to rejoin the family circle for the remainder of
the day.
It is true the family circle was rarely a private one;
and now, in addition to Mr. Hamlyn's formal dinner-
parties and political banquets, it became necessary to
return the series of entertainments by which Lord Dart-
ford's family chose to mark their approval of a match,
which, unable to prevent, they were wise enough to as-
sume the merit of sanctioning. In addition to Lady
Rotherwood, who really loved both her nephew and the
object of his choice, and rejoiced in their prospects of
happiness, a variety of noble cousins made eager interest
for the eventual civilities of Dartford Hall, by the promp-
titude of their attentions to the future bride.
"Did you ever see anything to equal the pretensions
of those Hamlyns ?" was now the cry of Lady Bondwell

and her class. “To have gradually wormed themselves,
step by step, into the highest place in the fashionable
world, how cunningly must they have crawled, and crept,
and smiled, and whispered. First, they pushed forward
their
son, that the son might push on his sister; and the
children, having established themselves so brilliantly in
life, will drag forward their parents."
· Ay, ay !” was Sir Benjamin Bondwell's reply to the
insinuations of his indignant spouse. “But you won't
get me out of Russell Square a day the sooner. I know
the cost to a banker of these lordly acquaintances. One
must pay through the nose for å duke; and be out of
pocket many a long hundred to secure a Royal Highness
to one's fêtes. “Keep your shop, and your shop will
keep you!' says the proverb; but by keeping such fine
company, a banker has a hard matter to keep out of the
Gazette! They tell me Hamlyn's to be made a baronet
in the next batch ! Why not a peer, at once ?-A Lord,
on 'change, would be a novelty!' If I did sell myself to
government, it should not be too cheap!"
Lady Bondwell, as the lady-consort of a Peg-Nicolson-
knight, was overwhelmed at the idea of having to yield
precedence to Lady Hamlyn.
“ Where is their ambition to stop !" cried she. How-
ever, I've heard of folks who, by putting all their silver
into the tankard, had nothing left to drink in it at last.”
By the expiration of the month, which enabled Lord
Dartford to announce to his mother the certainty of her
speedily becoming a dowager, since he was an accepted
man, and happier in Lydia's affections than in his num-
berless sources of earthly happiness,-a thousand ill-na-
tured attacks had been made in the Sunday papers upon
the mésalliance of the young marquis, and the presump-
tion of a banker's family in pretending to commingle its
three emblematic balls of Lombardy with those of a
coronet; and unused, in the respectable obscurity of his
earlier days, to this species of notoriety, Richard Hamlyn
shrank in agony from the blistering touch of the brand-
ing-iron. But it afforded sufficient consolation for being
called a banker in English somewhat less courtly than he
was in the habit of hearing at his dinner-table in Caven.

dish Square, when the liberal settlements suggested by
his
young son-in-law were laid before him by his solicitor;
and the noble invalid from Dartford Hall arrived in town,
to make the acquaintance of her daughter-in-law. Colonel
Hamilton, too, was hourly expected at Fenton's with his,
to become an eyewitness of the general happiness.
There was some difficulty in recognising, under its
present brilliant and aristocratic aspect, the dreariness
which had characterized for so many years the methodical
household of Hamlyn the banker.
CHAPTER XVIII.
“It were better to meet some dangers half-way, though they come nothing
near, than to keep too long a watch upon their approaches; for if a man watch too
long, it is odds he will fall asleep."-Bacon.
“I HOPE and trust my young friend the Marquis won't
be jealous, my dear, when he hears that your mother
(who stopped the carriage just now to welcome me to
Lon’on, at the corner of Holles Street) told me I should
find you alone, and gave me warrant for a téte-à-tête ?”
“ Gerald is very indulgent at present,” replied Miss
Hamlyn, with a smile. “These are courtship-days, you
know !-I will not promise, dear Colonel Hamilton, that
he will allow me to tell you a year hence, how glad I am
to be again sitting by your side!”
“I must try and keep him in good-humour by some
more Lion-hunts!” said the Colonel, laughing.
As
you say, these are courtship-days; and I couldn't help
feeling glad, my dear, when I heard they were to be spun
out a bit, by making you wait for the wedding! Even
in the happiest marriages, wedlock has as many thorns as
courtship roses."
“ Are you trying to cast a gloom upon my prospects ?”
Rather, my dear, to put you into conceit with the
old Marchioness's pragmaticality,” cried the Colonel.
“I assure you
that

the
many kind things Lady
Dartford has done for us,” she replied, “ her postpone-

ment of our wedding has been the kindest. Gerald and
I are allowed to see each other daily; and I do not mind
saying to you, who so dearly love and appreciate my best
of mothers, that I should not have been happy to leave her
till Harry is established at home. My sister will be two
years longer in the school-room; and my father's time,
between the banking-house and House of Commons, is
so thoroughly taken up, that I fear poor mamma would
miss me, unless Harry were at hand to take my place.”
Why, to say the truth, I fancied just now that she
looked paler and thinner than usual. Though she said a
thousand fine things about her son-in-law, I saw tears in
her eyes!”
“Not on our account,—for I can assure you that she
is beginning to love Gerald as if he were a child of her
own. And so she ought, for it is impossible to be more
dutifully attached than he is to her. But she is uneasy
about Harry."
6 What the deuce !—The senior wrangler been turning
restiff again ?-Not been bitten anew, I hope, with the
banker-phobia ?”-
“ He has written to prepare mamma for being deeply
mortified by the result of his approaching examina-
tion."
“Why 'tisn't that frets her, surely? A woman sur-
rounded with every earthly blessing, can afford to dis-
pense with the cheers of the Cambridge Senate-House!"
· Not when their absence affords a proof that her son's
spirit is broken. However, it is useless to talk of it!
My father's will is as that of the Medes and Persians.
So talk to me about Mrs. Hamilton.—Talk to me about
Ellen ! - Why didn't you bring her with you to-day?"
“She caught a sad cold on the railway,—the cold of an
opera-singer, in my private opinion. I've a notion, my
dear, that the poor girl is tenacious of forms and ceremo-
nies as regards your family, from whom she received a
bit of a slight; and unless I'm much mistaken, Ellen
won't set foot in Cavendish Square, till you've some
of ye been to say, 'How d’ye do’ at our Hotel in
St. James's Street.'

ing. “As soon as mamma comes home, we will drive
straight to Fenton's.—But I hope Mrs. Hamilton is not
a formal person?"
“She won't be formal with you, Lydia. She's prepared
to love you with all her might and main. And what's
more, she's very fond of your handsome young Marquis,
my dear,-'Gerald,' as you've the sauciness to call him.
She was quite sorry when he left Dean Park! For he
often walked over to the Manor; and used to amuse her
for hours, rhodomontading about you ;-how much better
you talked and walked, rode, drove a pony-chaise, shot at
a mark, played billiards, and did all sorts of tomboy
things, that would shock Miss Creswell to hear of,)
than any other charmer of his acquaintance. Don't look
80 angry! He didn't accuse you, perhaps, of quite all
these accomplishments.
But he said that one of your
greatest charms consisted in not being missish; in speak-
ing your mind frankly, and in enjoying life cordially ;-
not like a wax doll stuffed with bran, after the fashion of
half the young ladyships of his acquaintance.”
“And pray is his account of Mrs. Hamilton equally to
be relied on?” cried Lydia, much amused. “For be
pronounces her the most beautiful woman in England ;-
in proof of which, he asserts that Alberic Vernon, of
woman-hating renown, has fallen desperately in love with
her.”
“I hope he'd the grace to tell you, at the same time,
that the passion is anything but mutual ?-He and I
used to amuse ourselves for hours, watching Master
Alberic making the agreeable, and she snubbing him
every moment; while your brother Watty, who has a
mighty leaning towards these Vernons, used to look as
if he were sitting on hot iron, for fear the young spark
should take offence at Ellen's plain-speaking.”
“I think Walter has rather a partiality for The Hyde !"
said Lydia, gravely.
“ Lord Dartford used to swear he was in love with
that die-away damsel of a daughter. So I don't suppose
he'll be particularly pleased at hearing what has happened
since he and the Marquis left Dean Park.”
“To Miss Vernon ?"

“No, to her popinjay of a brother! The coxcomb
actually popped the question to Nelly! To be sure, she
didn't give him an opportunity to make quite as great an
ass of himself as I could have wished; for she desired me
to convey to him as decided a negative as one could
express without knocking him down. So I lost all the
fun I'd promised myself in a long courtship.”
“Well done, Mrs. Hamilton,—to resist that fine old
place. Why, dearly as I love Gerald, I could scarcely
have withstood the Holbein Gallery and oaks at The '.
Hyde!” cried Lydia, laughing.--"Seriously, dear Colonel,
what consternation must Mrs. Hamilton's rejection have
caused to the Vernons."
“I know only one thing that would have caused
greater consternation, my dear,--that is, her accepting
him !—Bless your soul, his father and mother would have
died no other death than seeing their Phænix united
with a commoner's widow!-- There would have had to be
as fine a funeral at Braxbain Church, as I hope there'll
be a wedding, at Ovington, come next June !-By the
way, it would have done your heart good to see how
proud the worthy Doctor was when your letter arrived;
apprising him of your marriage, and asking him to per-
form the ceremony. Just like one of yours and your
mother's pretty thoughts !—Markham fancied that your
father, being up to his ears in dignitaries of the Church,
would be wanting a Bishop at least, for the grandeur of
the thing."
"On the contrary, but for my respect for Dr. Markham,
Lord Dartford's tutor, old Mr. Buckingham would have
been the man.
“Well! some of these days, my dear, you must find a
good living for Markham. He wants it, I suspect, poor
fellow, for there's another little olive-branch coming some
time this spring. I'm to be godfather, I'd have you
tỏ
know; and I shall be having Lord Dartford next asking
me to be bridesman! Poor old Jack is everybody's odd
man,-everybody's dirty dog!-But good-bye, good-bye.
I've promised to be home by three, to beaù Ellen to the
Panorama of Naples. — She's always hankering after
Italy,--foolish girl!"

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
"And is not afraid, it seems, of increasing her cold by
a visit to Leicester Fields !”
“Ah!-Well !—I see I've let the cat out of the bag.
Never mind. Make allowances for her, my dear Lydia,
and persuade your mother to give us a call.”
There was no need of the suggestion. In the course
of the day, Colonel Hamilton, (who, living in a circle
composed of persons mutually interested in each other's
affairs, was apt to repeat all that he heard,) related to
Ellen, after describing the great happiness of Lydia, the
uneasiness entertained by her mother on Henry's account.
Having wholly forgotten the Trinity letter and Whitehall
encounter, it did not occur to him that his companion was
peculiarly interested in knowing that, so far from turning
out first man of his year, Henry Hamlyn was likely to prove
a failure; so thoroughly was his spirit damped by being
forced by his father into a career distasteful to his feelings.
Ellen instantly made up her mind to volunteer a visit to
Cavendish Square, the following day. In the interim,
however, even this project was forestalled. Mrs. Hamlyn
wrote to request that the Colonel and Mrs. Hamilton
would accompany her to her box at the Opera, which
was a double one; and Ellen, who a few hours before
would have declined the invitation, hastened to comply.
Even harassed as was Richard Hamlyn at this juncture
by the unspoken menaces of Spilsby, it would have
afforded him some comfort could he have surmised the
degree of mortification unintentionally inflicted that
night by his wife upon one of his enemies.
In selecting an Opera-box for her, he had chosen that
it should be within view of Lady Vernon's, that the
ladies of The Hyde might learn by ocular demonstration
that, whatever might be the distance between them in
Warwickshire, in London their acquaintanceships were
the same; and from the commencement of the season, it
had been wormwood to Lucinda to see the Marquis,-
her Marquis,--seated by the side of the lovely Lydia,
whom, a few months before, she had treated as an insig-
nificant school-girl; more especially as, whenever Mrs.
Hamlyn felt too much out of spirits to attend the opera,
Lady Rotherwood officiated as chaperon to the future

Marchioness. Lord Vernon resented it, of course, as a
new injury on the part of Providence, that the lessee of
her Majesty's Theatre should have presumed to let one:
of the boxes within four of his own, to such people as
the family of Hamlyn the banker. But there was no
remedy! Either Lucinda and her mother must renounce
the enjoyment of the opera, or find their delight in Grisi.
and Rubini embittered by this infamous misappropriation
of the Marquis of Dartford, and Box 27!
But on the night in question, an aggravation of evil
was in store for them. On their way to their box, Lady
Vernon had claimed the arm of the Duc de Montmorency,
one of the diplomatic attachés; a person whom, in the
absence of a promising match as the attendant of her
daughter, she regarded as an advantageous additon to
her box; and, as the Duke was too well-bred to take an
immediate leave of the lady who had honoured him by so
pointed a preference, he sat down patiently to be flirted
with by Lucinda.
Scarcely, however, had he been five minutes seated,
when his glasses were levelled steadily at the seat usually
occupied by the Hamlyns. But, unwilling to provoke
the observations certain to be made by a dozen different
visitors, every opera-night, touching the good-fortune of
Lord Dartford and the striking beauty of his intended
bride, Miss Vernon took no notice of the pre-occupation
of her companion.
Persons of the Duc de Montmorency's nation seldom.
keep their impressions to themselves. His admiration
soon burst forth in exclamations of “ Charmante !"-
“ Divine !”—“Un port de déesse, -une taille de nymphe !"
“Very pretty, certainly. And how admirably Persiani
is singing to-night,” observed Lucinda, in hopes of
moderating his enthusiasm.
“Admirably !—But who is this lovely neighbour of
“The daughter of a banker, a person of whom you are
never likely to have heard.”
“ You are speaking of Miss Hamlyn, the beautiful
creature
my Lord Dartford is to marry,” said the Duke.
“I have seen her hundreds of times; and in my opinion,
yours ?”

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
she is nearly the prettiest, and quite the best-dressed
girl in town. But the lady I am admiring is a thousand
times more beautiful. If such a woman were to appear
at our opera in Paris, elle ferait fureur.-But nothing
makes a sensation in London. In London, it is scarcely
worth while to be a beauty, or a comet, or a cat with six
legs. You chilly insulaires would scarcely be at the
trouble of an interjection, were Cleopatra, in her galley,
to arrive on the Thames. —And, by the way, yonder lovely
being gives one rather the idea of Cleopatra.
Lucinda, afraid, perhaps, of being classed among her
uninterjectional country-people, now affected some
interest in the subject; and, instead of being satisfied
with her own lorgnon, borrowed the double-barrels of the
Duke, to examine the new beauty.
“She is, indeed, wonderfully handsome!” was her
irrepressible exclamation. “Look, mamma,—Who can
she be?”.
Probably some vulgar city connexion of the
Hamlyns !"
** City connexion, perhaps, but not vulgar," rejoined
the Duke. And in another minute, unable to restrain
hiš curiosity, he rose, and was about to leave them, when
the boxkeeper's key grated in the lock, and Alberic made
his appearance.
"I dare say my brother can tell us about her," said
Miss Vernon, eager to detain him. Alberic!- who is
the lady with Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughter ?”
Mr. Vernon, after protesting that he had not yet had
time to look round the house, and a fussy adjustment of
his glasses, as though for the discovery of a planet,
leant over the head of his sister to examine with a super-
cilious air the contents of "the menagerie of Hamlyn
the banker.”
But instantly receding into his place, and withdrawing
his glasses, he began to stammer forth remarks upon the
new ballet.
The Duke, however, was not to be thus distanced.-
" Who was the lady ?” he again anxiously inquired.
“A ow," was Alberic's hurried reply; "a woman
you are never likely to meet in society."

Montmorency persisted in inquiring the name of the
lady he was never destined to meet in society.
Hamilton!”
“Ha! A very good name, -an historical name,--the
English name of all others best known on the Continent,"
cried Montmorency. “Your Scottish Duke of Hamilton
is the representative of one of our French duchies.”
“But this person has nothing to do with our Scottish
Duke of Hamilton," cried Lady Vernon, vexed beyond
her patience. “ You are probably unaware that the
names of the great Scotch families extend to the re-
tainers of their clan; and there is no more connexion
between these vassals and the head of their house, than
there would be between your coachinan and you, were it
custom of the French to give their patronymic to their
servants.”
“I am quite aware of it!" cried the Duke. “But,
while contemplating yonder beautiful creature, I am in-
clined to parody the observation of your famous comedian,
and say, "If God writes a legible hand, that woman is a
lady!
“She shall be an empress, if you like!" rejoined
Lucinda. “But she is a person we should very reluc-
tantly admit into our society.”
Montmorency, too well-bred to gainsay the dictum of
so fair a lady, uttered some common-place remark con-
cerning the ballet, by way of changing the conversation;
and unluckily addressed his sally to Alberic Vernon.
“ The lady is cruel, I_see!” said Montmorency,
adverting to the gorgeous Baron in front of the stage,
who had just flung himself at the feet of Cerito. “The
Herr Baron yonder is too great a barbarian to perceive
that it requires more than his empty grandeur to subdue
the heart of a pretty woman.
I hate a fellow who makes
love on the strength of his sixteen quarterings!"
Before Mr. Vernon could rouse himself from the shock
of what he considered a sally of persiflage, Montmorency
had left the box in search of some friend of Dartford,
who would put him in the way of a presentation to the
beautiful friend of the Hamlyns; and no sooner was he
gone, than Lucinda and her mother burst into excla-
;

mations of wonder at the want of tact exhibited by
foreigners in discriminating between high and low in
English society:
I should have thought that a Montmorency, -a
member of the first baronial family in Christendom,-
might know better than throw away his admiration
on the vulgar widow of a son of that upstart Colonel
Hamilton!” said Lady Vernon, fanning herself with
such fervour of indignation, that Alberic entertained
little doubt the news of his passion had reached his
family. His only hope was, that tidings of his rejection
might be somewhat longer on the road.
Still, though he would willingly have condemned Mrs.
Hamilton to the cauldron of boiling oil in which the
Jewess of Constance was made to atone for the brightness
of her eyes, he chose to vindicate his choice by the force
of lordly example.
“You were wrong to say that Mrs. Hamilton was a
woman you should be sorry to associate with, Inda!”
said he, addressing his sister. “Nothing is more likely
than that you will have her next winter at Ormeau.”
"Impossible. Yet I remember that the Hamiltons
had manæuvred themselves into an acquaintance with
the Elvastons before we left the country !” said Lady
Vernon, unable to avoid the vexatious spectacle of the
Duc de Montmorency presented in form to Mrs. Hamilton
and Lydia Hamlyn, by the Marquis of Dartford.
“And since you left it, they have spent a fortnight
there to so much purpose, that Lord Edward Sutton is
wild to marry Colonel Hamilton's daughter-in-law, and
his family equally eager to promote the match."
“ Lord Edward Sutton ?- Why, he is to inherit the
Wrottesley property, and is already in possession of six
or seven thousand a-year! I can understand that a
young man in the situation of Captain Hamlyn, with no
connexion, and only money enough to wish for more,
might be tempted" by Colonel Hamilton's fifteen or
twenty thousand a-year, (what has he?) But for a man
of family and fortune like Lord Edward Sutton-no, no!
I can't believe it! I should as soon expect, Alberic, to
hear her talked of for you!"

OR, COURT AND CITY.
275
This was said wholly without design; for Lady Vernon
was the sort of woman whom a gossip must be endued
with more courage than usually falls to the lot of that
sneaking tribe, to accost with intelligence of the degra-
dation of her son. But young Vernon, accustomed to
witness the sparring between his father and mother,
(who were apt, like the populace of Rome during the
Carnival, to knock each other down with flints formed
into the semblance of sugar-plums,) had little doubt that
he was being flogged over the shoulders of Lord Edward
Sutton.
While this uneasy family were studying how to con-
vert even the pleasures of life into pains, the inmates of
Mrs. Hamlyn's box were enjoying one of those pleasant
evenings created by the union of agreeable friends, fine
music, exquisite dancing, and the succession of fair faces
recreating their eyes during the intervals of the per-
formance. - To Mrs. Hamilton, the airs of the Lucia were
familiar and precious as some rich shrine to the eyes of a
votary; nor did they lose by association with the pre-
sence of her new friends. And while the Colonel sat
conversing with the banker's wife and daughter, Lord
Dartford was engaged in obtaining from Ellen instruc-
tions for his bridal tour.
“ Admit that I am the luckiest of the human race, my
dear Mrs. Hamilton!” said he.—“In these times, when
everybody has seen everything, and half the angelic
beings in London are as blasé as old gentlemen of fifty,
to have found a little wife who knows no more of the
world than I do myself,—as vulgarly delighted as I am
with a good opera, -and as enthusiastic in her desire to
see something more of valley and mountain in the way
of landscape, than is to be found in old England. I am
beginning to think that we two and Colonel Hamilton
are the only children left in the world !"
Miss Hamlyn interrupted him to entreat Mrs. Hamil-
ton's indulgence towards his egotism.
“I beg to state that I do not apologize!” persisted
the young lover, fixing his eyes on the lovely face that
borrowed new charms from the blushes by which it was
overspread. “I look upon Mrs. Hamilton as one of the

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
family; and shall be only too happy to listen when she
favours me, in return for my selfish confessions, with
sisterly confidences of a similar nature.”
Though this was said at random, and with reference to
Colonel Hamilton's avowed projects in favour of Walter
rather than to Henry, with whom at present Lord Dart-
ford, had little acquaintance, it sufficed to alarm the
womanly dignity of Ellen Hamilton. Her countenance
forthwith assumed that quiet gravity which so well
became its chaste but somewhat severe expression.
It was at this pause in the conversation that the door
of the box was opened to admit Captain Hamlyn and the
Duc de Montmorency, who had requested Walter to
present him to his family; and Dartford, who, with all
his disposition to be brotherly, had not quite forgotten
his friend's avowals of contempt for the rusticity of
Colonel Hamilton's daughter-in-law, could scarcely
repress a smile at the deferential manner in which he
was already beginning to address the lady who was an
object of adoration to Dukes, and the sons of Dukes.
Too slavishly fashionable, however, was the Captain,
to be seen in his mother's opera-box longer than the
time necessary for the presentation of his diplomatic
friend. Intending to return, towards the close of the
ballet, and offer his arm to Mrs. Hamilton through the
crush-room, he proceeded on a short visit to the Vernons;
justly calculating that the fair Lucinda would scarcely
exhibit her usual hauteur, with Dartford and Mont-
morency engaged before her eyes in courteous homage
to his family.
Nor was he deceived in his hopes of a gracious recep-
tion.' Miss Vernon and her mother were not popular.
Lucinda, one of those heartless London girls who, while
engaged in pursuit of a particular object, are indiscreet
enough to care little whose feelings they wound, found
herself, when thrown out in her Marquis-chase, alone in
her glory,-without a single suitor or admirer. It was
consequently a relief when Captain Hamlyn presented
himself to occupy the place vacated by the recreant
duke; and to retain him, Lucinda exerted herself to
“talk delightfully with all her might.” The consequence

277
was,
that Walter remained enchanted in his chair, during
the last act of the ballet; nor was it till a prodigious
rustling of satin cloaks and fluttering of swansdown, in
an opposite box, apprised him, by the departure of a
royal party, that the evening's entertainments 'were
drawing to a close, that he suddenly replaced his glasses
in their morocco case; and Lady Ôernon and her
daughter perceived by the farewell nature of his þow,
that they had no hope of his assistance in steering
through the crush-room. But, alas ! scarcely had Walter
reached Mrs. Hamlyn's box, when he beheld in the
lobby before him,—Mrs. Hamilton leaning on the arm of
Lord Edward Sutton!
While the family of the banker occupied this brilliant
position in the eyes of the fashionable world, the fountain-
head of their pomps and vanities was sorely troubled.
Richard Hamlyn ħad dined that day at the Bankers'
Club; enjoying to a degree appreciable only by worldly
natures, the congratulations of his brother bankers on
the approaching marriage in his family.
Some few, who had lived in interchange of services
with him, shook him heartily by the hand; rejoicing in
an event likely to increase his domestic happiness by that
of his daughter. Others, the new-fangled baronets of
the Order of the Golden Calf, who regarded financial
opulence as a bridge of ingots whereby to crawl into the
ranks of the aristocracy, expressed, by more deferential
salutations, their delight at an alliance ennobling the
whole bankerhood of Great Britain. One or two, of
genuinely philosophical views, were moderate in their
congratulations on a marriage which they regarded, like
all other disproportions, as a source of social disorder;
while Sir Benjamin Bondwell, who contemplated with a
jealous eye the advancement of the Hamlyns, and their
pretensions to fashionable notoriety, seized the occasion
for launching against him, under the guise of compliments,
a thousand covert-sneers on his
“Showing dolphin-like above
The element he lived in."

only to smile,-take all in good part,—and endeavour to
restore the conversation to its usual channel.
At length, when such of his brethren as were neither
in parliament nor connected with the attractive clubs of
the Carlton quarter, sat down to finish the evening at
whist, battling for half-crown points with as much cogita-
tion and earnestness as had enabled them in the morning
to net thousands by a successful stroke of speculation,
Richard Hamlyn hurried away to the House. There had
been a time when almost the only social pleasure he en-
joyed consisted in those club-meetings. There was the
name of his father had in remembrance. There still
lingered two or three grave, gray-headed men, who had
begun life as the bosom-friends of Walter Hamlyn; and
still kept among their family relics the mourning-rings
they had worn on his decease.
But now, the society of these men was becoming hate-
ful to him of Dean Park. Not because by his new con-
nexions he was elevated above their level; but because,
by his recent policy, he bad sunk immeasurably below it.
He trembled at the idea that rumours might transpire,
not alone the fearful ones likely to be set afloat by Spilsby,
but of the sinister course he had pledged himself to pur-
sue in parliament, on a question of financial policy deeply
involving the interests of his moneyed colleagues.
The discovery must come! He knew that, in the
course of a few weeks, he should be pointed out among
them as having sold them to Government for thirty pieces
of silver. But he dreaded the first indications of the
coming storm. He shrank from exposure of the baseness
into which he had been betrayed by terrors arising from
still deeper turpitude. While undergoing the coarse
bantering of old Bondwell, he dreaded every moment lest
the uncompromising Sir Benjamin should assail him by
he name of Judas. A remote allusion to his filthy
bargain with Government, would have wounded him far
deeper than the accusation of tuft-hunting.

Getting hastily into the carriage, he proceeded to the
House of Commons; where, as the tale of his apostacy
was still unbruited, he ascended the staircase with his
usual consciousness of the dignity attached to every com-
ponent entity of the first body-corporate in enlightened
Europe. After expending an hour in a whispered col-
loquy over the shoulder of Lord Crawley, (which, if the
truth must be told, bore little reference to the long-
winded speech with which an honourable opposition
member was favouring his constituents north of the
Tweed, through the wearied ears of the Reporters' gallery,
-one of those dreary parliamentary passages that lead to
nothing,)—the banker, finding there was to be no division,
returned to Cavendish Square; attributing just then to
the name of home, something of the charm which every
man of business connects with the leisure he has only
enjoyed for five hasty minutes, since the hour of an early
breakfast.
His family had not returned from the opera; and
Ramsay, as he hurried before his master into the study to
light the lamp, took occasion to mention that “ a person
had called twice in the course of the evening, requesting
urgently to see Mr. Hamlyn.”
Did not the gentleman leave his name?” inquired.
the banker, who was seldom molested at his private
residence by the intrusion of persons,"unless a Barthorpe
constituent, who could not be made to understand that,
in London, business-hours conclude with the first stroke
of the dinner-bell.
“The first time he came, sir, he left no, name, but
merely said he would call again, as we rather expected
you home early,” replied Ramsay, proceeding as leisurely
with his task of removing and replacing the globe of the
Carcel lamp as if the enlightenment of the universe
depended on the evenness of its wick and steadiness of
its light.—“The second time, sir, as he seemed so very
persewering and determined, in making his inquiries of
John as to where you had dined, and whether you were
likely to be met with at the House, I came to the door
myself; and unless I am mistaken, sir, it was one of the
banking-clerks from Lombard Street.

"A bald-headed man ?” inquired Hamlyn, in a low
voice, and with assumed unconcern.
“He had his hat on, sir; I really can't take upon me to
say. But now I think of it, John told me he had written
his name.”
“ Where is John ?-Send him hither."
“ The footmen are gone with the carriage to fetch my
mistress from the opera," replied Ramsay, and as he re-
placed the lamp on the study-table, its light fell direct
upon an open blotting-book where lay a strip of paper,
evidently deposited by John before he proceeded to his
duties of the evening.
It scarcely needed for Mr. Hamlyn to cast his eyes on
the name subscribed in clerkly text, with due regard to
the open looping of the Y's and curling of the Š’s,—to
learn that his untimely and ill-omened visitor was no
other than-SPILSBY!
What could be the meaning of this unauthorized in-
trusion ? A short time before, and Hamlyn would
sooner have expected Birnam Wood to come to Dunsi-
nane, or the Monument on Fish Street Hill to pay a
morning visit to the Duke of York's Column, as for any
member of his Lombard Street establishment to make
his appearance, on business of his own devising, at his
private residence; the groves of Dodona being less sacred
in the sight of the priesthood of Apollo, than in theirs,
the scaly-barked plane-trees of Cavendish Square.
But, alas ! he was not unprepared for so singular an
infraction of subordination on the part of his clerk. The
countenance of Spilsby was a book in which he was be-
ginning to read strange things, as distinctly as though its
characters were as legibly inscribed as the raised letter-
press invented for the use of the blind; and from the
day his daughter's marriage was publicly announced, the
banker had deciphered in the eyes of his rebellious Vizier
a determination to turn to account the predicament of his
Sultan.
The higher the position attained by Hamlyn, the greater
the power of the man who was able to precipitate him
from his high estate into an abyss of infamy. From the
apex of his present prosperity, with a daughter about to

form an alliance with a peer of the realm,—a son distin-
guished by the general favour of society, and occupying a
commission in one of the first regiments,-another on the
eve of attaining high academic honours preparatory to
assuming his place in that house of business, to maintain
the credit of which his father had attempted such terrible
sacrifices,—from the eminence of all this, to be precipitated
into the dust, would be, indeed, a cruel reverse.
For a week past, the clerk had exhibited symptoms of
desiring a private interview with his master; and it was
with agony of spirit scarcely describable, that Hamlyn
had watched him making his exits and entrances; ex-
pecting nothing less, every time he made his appearance
in the private room, than an explanation, than which
death itself would have been more welcome, if death could
have ensued without withdrawing the curtain from the
disgraceful position of his affairs.
So certain, however, did he now feel of a forthcoming
crisis, that instead of indulging in his usual prayer for
the respite of a few years, in hopes that the fruition of
some of his numerous schemes or a considerable bequest
from Colonel Hamilton might enable him to fill up cer-
tain deficiences in his accounts the consciousness of which
"appalled his spirit like a night-shriek,” he satisfied him-
self with murmuring, between his grinding teeth, in the
watches of the night,—“But a few months !--Let it be
delayed only till Lydia's marriage shall have been
solemnized, and a shelter provided for the others, -and I
will submit to the worst !-- That worst would scarcely be
harder to bear, than this accursed persecution !"

“ Bless my soul and body! Who would have thought
of finding you here, with the Vere Street clock striking

Hamilton, addressing Richard Hamlyn, on entering the

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
dining-room in Cavendish Square the following morning,
as the family were rising from breakfast. “I fancied you
safe in the parish of St. Sepulchre, or I wouldn't have set
foot in your house !"
“It is not often I am idling at the West End at this
hour of the day,” replied Hamlyn, with a smile,-affect-
ing to humour the cheerful old man's bantering. “But I
have an appointment with my lawyers at twelve, and
wish to take in my way to the city.”
“ Don't let me be any hindrance to you, then. Into
your cab with you, and be off!" cried the Colonel, taking
the offered seat beside Mrs. Hamlyn, “or we shall be
having Messrs. Pounce and Parchment in a pucker, all
along of the marriage-settlements of a certain Miss Lydia
Hamlyn, who sits there, looking as demure and uncon-
cerned as if she'd never heard the words jointure or pin-
money! But, by the way, Hamlyn, as you've ten minutes
on hand afore you start, I may as well tell you some news
that reached me this morning from our part of the world.
There's a report of a bankruptcy afloat, which has made
poor Ovington's hair stand on end.'
At the word bankruptcy, Richard Hamlyn, who was
gathering together his hat and gloves, unconsciously made
a step back towards the breakfast-table.
Jacob Durdan, they say, poor fellow, will be in the
Gazette in no time. Maltster,' I suppose, they'll call
him? But that's not our affair! The thing is, that his
farm is in the market; and lying, as it does, betwixt
Burlington and Dean Park, like the keystone of an arch,
suppose you won't like it to slip through your fingers ?
Buyit you must-either foryourself or young Burlington.
I am afraid not !" replied Hamlyn, much surprised
at the intelligence. “Durdan used to value his property
at between eleven and twelve thousand pounds; and the
bona fide value cannot be much less than seven.”
“ Then if the bona fide value's seven, to you 'tis worth
nearer fourteen,” persisted the Colonel; “and I shall
think you a deuced lucky dog if you get it at ten."
“ I fear I must be satisfied to do without it. A man
in business finds it a hard matter to lay his hands on ten
thousand pounds for private purposes."

283
“ Not when he's got an old friend at his elbow, with
thirty times ten lying idle, and the grace to be thankful
when an opportunity presents itself of making a portion
of it usual to better men than himself,” rejoined the
Colonel warmly.
Hamlyn felt every nerve in his frame vibrate as he
listened.
“ You are as welcome to invest my India bonds, or any
other tangible thing of mine, in land, and in your own
name, as though John Hamilton were under the turf
and Watty Hamlyn standing in his shoes!" added the
Colonel, fancying himself misunderstood.
The hand of the banker spasmodically clasped that of
his generous friend, as he replied-
“I feel all this as it ought to be felt. But Durdan's
farm, at the price likely to be put upon it, would be a
preposterous purchase."
“Well! I suppose you know best !" cried the Colonel.
“I haven't enough of the country-gentleman in me yet
to know how many years' purchase one ought to give for
land. Only I concluded this must be a windfall; as
Robson writes me word that Barlow of Alderham is nib-
bling already-for Lord Vernon, of course. Barlow is no
great capitalist, I take it. But 'twould be a nice little
tit-bit to tack to the skirts of the Braxham property."
Certainly-beyond all doubt! And Barłow has made
an offer ?”
“So it is supposed. But I remember Robson saying
one day, as we were pottering together in the copse ad-
joining Durdan's, that if ever the property was in the
market you'd be sure to snap it up; and now, he writes
word, the people at Ovington look upon it as already
gone, so sure are they that you'll overbid Lord Vernon.”
They are mistaken,” said Hamlyn, gravely. “I should
not consider it justifiable to make the purchase.”
“Then you'll live to repent it when 'tis too late, and
you find Lord Vernon growing up like a grain of mustard-
seed under your nose, with all the Barlows of Alderham
roosting in his branches ! Barlow is looking out for a
farm to enable that cub of a son of his to prove what
deuced bad farmers ' a county family' can produce !"

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“However tempted, it is my duty to forbear," still
persisted the banker.
“What! when you know how difficult it is, now-a-
days, to get even four per cent. for money ? In a month
or so, I shall be having one hundred and fifteen thousand
pounds thrown upon my hands, (if Moonjee, Babahoy
and Company stand to their engagements;) and then
you'll be telling me that, instead of the ten per cent. my
friends at Ghazerapore have hitherto secured me, I may
whistle for five! However, don't let me detain you
with
my Ovington news! Go and settle Lydia's business;
and leave Mrs. Hamlyn and me to chat about what con-
cerns us more than dot-and-carry-one.”
Involuntarily, Hamlyn glanced towards his wife, whose
discomposure of countenance was so fatally manifest, that
he could have killed her on the spot. For he was rapidly.
approaching that state of mental exasperation which, in
humbler life, too often ends in crime.
But he was a banker; a man whose calmness, serenity,
plausibility, constitute part of his stock-in-trade; a man
who, so far from being “passion's slave," must be as
phlegmatic in self-possession, as demure in demeanour.
Taking from his servant his well-brushed hat and steady-
looking beaver gloves, after a benignant nod to his family,
and smile to Colonel Hamilton, the blandness of which
Howard the philanthropist might have envied, he with-·
drew from the room.
Alas! how many more Laocoons are to be met with
among the haunts of daily life than in all the united
Galleries of Art in Great Britain.
The eyes of Colonel Hamilton followed him to the
door as one dwells upon the aspect of a friend in the
fulness of his prosperity; satisfied that if there existed
a man on the face of the earth whose virtues had their
reward in the attainment of perfect worldly happiness,
it was that upright and self-denying individual, Hamlyn
the banker!
Even Ramsay, as he waited upon his master down the
snow-white steps of his stately doorway, contemplated
him with the abject deference paid by the vulgar only to
great capitalists, or great lords; and would have de-

nounced as a slanderous libeller the wretch who presumed
to espy a spot in such a sun of glory, as the Church-going,
Rate-paying, Orphan-school-presiding, Propagation-of-
the-gospel-subscribing, mild, virtuous, punctual individual
called Hamlyn, the banker!
Yet this impostor, this man of universal credit was but
a more polished, more cautious, more solid swindler in
the amount of thousands, where swindlers in the amount
of tens or hundreds are sentenced to the hulks!-
Scarcely had he driven from the door, when Colonel
Hamilton proceeded to unfold the purpose of his visit,
by placing in the hand of Mrs. Hamlyn a cheque for one
hundred pounds, on her husband's bank.
“ You'd do me a mon’ous favour,” said he, “ by look-
ing me out this trifle’s-worth of fal-lals for a lying-in lady
and her bantling, as a present for my good friend, Mrs.
Markham, to whose babe I've proposed myself as god-
father. I should look like an old ass, were I to present
myself at one of the Bond Street frilleries, where such
matters are ticketed up; and even Ellen (the more's the
pity) knows nothing about caudle-cup finery; so I thought
it might vex her, poor dear, if I put her upon executing
my commission. But as I know you are going about
just now, my dear ma'am, among linen and lace shops, in
order to give my lady, our young Marchioness yonder, a
few rags to her back at parting, I thought, maybe, you'd
give yourself so much trouble on my account.
“And with the more pleasure,” replied Mrs. Hamlyn,
that I have an unfeigned respect and regard for the
object of your kindness. No one better than myself ap-
preciates all that has been effected at Ovington by her
influence. The late Vicar was a widower; and though,
during his incumbency, everything was done by Dean
Park for the village that we are still doing, the poor
people were not half so healthy or happy as now ;-a
sufficient proof that it is the care of the Markhams, and
not the money we provide, which ministers to their
welfare.”
“Nothing can exceed Mrs. Markham's activity and
thoughtfulness,” added Lydia. “ Go where one will, or
exercise what charity one may, the Vicar's lady has always

been beforehand with us. Mrs. Markham is a model for
parsons' wives.”
“Well, my dear, as I said t'other day, you must get
Lord Dartford to reward the virtues of the Vicarage
with a fat living."
“On the contrary,” said Miss Hamlyn, humouring his
raillery, “it strikes me that her excellences are more
appropriate to a lean one.
And it would be very unpa-
triotic in me to remove the second providence of my native
Ovington!"
“But being thus disposed towards Mrs. Markham,"
resumed the banker's wife,“ believe me, you would please
her far more by converting your gift into a solid form.
The Markhams are not well off. They have secured, I
understand, a small provision for their children. But
their family is increasing; and a hundred pounds laid by
at compound interest would give your godchild a couple
of hundreds to help him on, if a boy, in the outset of
life.”
* By George! I do believe you've caught the money
fever of Hamlyn !" cried the Colonel, almost vexed.
“Can't I do something for a godchild, against it wants
putting out in life, without denying myself the pleasure
of seeing it tidy and smart, in its long clothes and
cockade?"
“ Just as you please!" replied Mrs. Hamlyn, who loved
the Colonel too sincerely to be affronted by his occasional
pettishness. “But take a woman's word for it that Mrs.
Markham has too much sense to care for lace and lawn;
and that
you had better let me purchase some more useful
present,--plate, linen, furniture, rather than finery. Even
the cap and robe that Lydia embroidered for little Kitty
have not, I am sure, been taken out of the wardrobe a
dozen times.”
“I'm afraid you're right," cried the Colonel. I wish
you'd be sometimes in the wrong, if 'twas only for a
change. Well, well! go to Rundell's, and look out a
sober parsonage-house-like tea-pot and coffee-pot, and a
cantine of spoons and forks. Will that suit you?”
“ It will suit the Markhams, which signifies much
more !" said Mrs. Hamlyn, good-humouredly. And while

she was speaking, there dashed up to the door the well-
appointed cab of her son Walter.
" By George, here's Watty himself, in the nick of
time !" cried Colonel Hamilton, rising and going to the
window. “He shall drive me to the silversmith's at
once, and take the trouble off your hands. Lydia, my
dear, what will you give me to tell you who the Captain's
brought with him from the barracks ?”
This intimation of Lord Dartford's arrival sufficed to
send Miss Hamlyn to the drawing-room to meet their
visitor; and as the Colonel and Mrs. Hamlyn prepared
to follow her, the veteran could not forbear exclaiming
that, next to the pleasure of being eighteen and in love
oneself, was that of witnessing so charming a juncture in
so charming a person.
“Her happiness is almost too great,” rejoined her
mother, with a sigh. “I sometimes tremble to think
what would be the consequence, should any unforeseen
event frustrate this hopeful marriage.”
“But what the deuce should happen to prevent it?"
cried the Colonel. “The old Marchioness is as pleased
as Punch, at the idea of her son's settling. As to him,
if Lydia's a wee bit in love, Lord Dartford's a better
specimen of a Romeo than I fancied was still left on the
face of this lukewarm globe.”
“It is true," replied Mrs. Hamlyn. “But one cannot
account for one's presentiments; and mine are all the
heavier, that I love this warm-hearted, noble-minded boy,
as if he were a child of my own. To number him among
my children in my prayers to Heaven, would be an addi-
tion to the happiness of my life.”
“Would be?-Say will be,-my dear ma'am! There's
no would in the case,” cried Colonel Hamilton. “I hate
what nervous folks pretend to call presentiments.'
What are they but a mistrusting of Providence ? Lydia
will be happy with her husband, and you with your son-
in-law; and then you'll feel ashamed of having allowed
yourself to glance at your prospects in life, through the
medium of a black-crape veil. So come along into the
drawing-room, and let me hear whether Walter will take
charge of me. If we should happen to meet some of his

smart brother officers on our road, he can say, I'm a
quizzical old uncle, from whom he has expectations."
And chuckling at his own joke against himself, the
Colonel hobbled into the drawing-room, and, much in the
same terms, made his proposition to Captain Hamlyn.
“There's no- fine folks astir yet, Watty,” said he.
you
cart me as far as Ludgate Hill, to choose some
plate ? If I haven't the benefit of better taste than my
own, they'll be putting me off with old-fashioned rubbish,
and making me pay for the last new kick.”
But for his vivid recollection of the “beautiful Ellen,'
as he had seen her leaning on the arm of Lord Edward
Sutton the preceding night, Walter would, perhaps, have
pleaded an engagement with Lord Dartford. But as his
future brother-in-law had to announce a visit from the
Marchioness, at two o'clock, which must keep the rest of
the party at home, there was no excuse for non-compli-
ance with the request of Colonel Hamilton.
“ And I tell you what you shall do for me, my dear
fellow, if you are going to Rundell’s,” said Lord Dart-
ford. “Tell them that the paste model they sent yester-
day for the diadem they are re-setting, is much too broad
for the prettiest little head in England; and that they
had better let one of their fellows take an exact measure,
with gold wire or something of that kind, before they set
to work. I must say," continued he, turning to Lydia,
“I think Rundell rather gone by, for anything beyond a
necklace. But my mother would be affronted if I took
the family jewels anywhere but to the house which has
been in charge of them for more than half a century.
Quite right !" said Lydia. “After all, what does it
signify? Diamonds, whether arranged in a manner more
or less becoming to the wearer, are of little consequence
compared with the chance of vexing Lady Dartforda
After wearing them so long, she naturally looks on them
as her own; and I should have been far better pleased

Hall; or perhaps you'll give him an impression of your
own?"
These commissions, so soothing to the worldly-minded
Walter, reconciled him to the idea of a drive with an old
gentleman in a low-crowned hat, who had not the excuse
for his originality of being a county member; and having
determined to make his way along those dreary Boule-
varts called the City Road, as a security against an en-
counter with his fashionable friends, he proceeded at a
slapping pace through Pentonville towards Gray's Inn
Lane.
“ That's as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my
life !” cried Colonel Hamilton, after a prolonged medita-
tion
upon the excellent temper and warm affections of
the young Marquis. “Your good mother always adds,
“as perfect as is compatible with a defective education.'
She, you know, has been a little Greek-and-Latin bitten,
ever since your brother began to carry off University
prizes! I always observe, by the way, that women are
twice as proud of the soldiership or scholarship of their
sons, as the fathers. If you'd been one of the heroes of
Waterloo, poor Madam Hamlyn would have been in love
with ‘guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder'
for the remainder of her days."
“ Lucky, then, that I have fallen on times more pa-
cific,” said Captain Hamlyn. “But apropos to Harry,
my dear Colonel, you, who are in my mother's confidence,
--which is the next thing to being in my brother's,
whereas with me he is beginning to establish something
of an Esau and Jacob jealousy-
Are you sure, Watty, that the split is not of your own
making ?" interrupted the Colonel, turning suddenly
towards him.
Quite sure. I love Harry with all my
heart and soul.
But, I have often noticed that, between only brothers,
rivalship is apt to spring up.”
“ Cain-and-Abelship, I call it-
“Which so far exists on Harry's part towards myself,
that, ever since his return from Italy, he has not been the
same brother to me."

“We meet by letter, every now and then, but not as

commend me to a half-confidential letter from one with

“But are you as frank as ever with him? Nothing
but confidence begets confidence; and if Harry has found
out that there's a Blue Chamber in your mind, of course
he's right to lock the door of his! To tell you the truth,
Watty,my boy, I'm half afraid there'snothing more difficult
than for brothers to maintain total unreserve. Betwixt
two friends, there are no jarring interests to produce close-
ness or hesitation.-But what were you beginning to say,
just now, about confidences likely to have been made me
by your mother, on Harry's account?”
"Simply that, as she called in your influence to mediate
between my brother and father, about the partnership in

more explicit with
you than myself, concerning the origin
of Harry's indisposition.”

appeared only a little outburst of fraternal spleen.

so close a shave against the wheel of an omnibus at Battle

-his compliance with my father's solicitude about the
banking-house has been fatal to his hopes as a lover; and
my mother declares that he has become broken-hearted,
broken-spirited, -incapable of pursuing his studies."
“Bless my soul !-this is bad news indeed!” cried the
Colonel, collapsing into a corner to connect all he was
hearing with the concealments practised upon him by
his daughter-in-law, and, after some minutes' cogitation,
giving it up as a bad job; so hard was it to his simple
mind to dive into motives where his affections were
concerned. “ And what does your father say to it all ?"
resumed he, after a pause.
“No one dares molest him with the history of his
son's discomfiture! My father is so practical a man,
and so unapt to allow his own feelings to interfere with
the discharge of his duties, that it requires some courage
to ask his indulgence on such points.
“But if this attachment of your brother's be of an
unobjectionable nature-
Of course it is,” interrupted Walter Hamlyn, warmly,
or he would not have presumed to make a confidante of
my mother!”
“That's true indeed! Then, by George! I'll speak
to Hamlyn about it myself !”
“Interference might, perhaps, do more harm than
good," observed his companion, dreading the influence
which Colonel Hamilton's want of tact might exercise
over the destinies of Henry. My father would be
furious at the idea of a young fellow of his age pretend-
ing to form a serious attachment. Why, even Ì, whose
prospects are more positive than Henry's"
“ Well-even you ?” cried the Colonel, perceiving him
hesitate, as if afraid of having gone too far.

marrying, unless for money.”.
“ Sell yourself, eh ?-By George, Ellen is right. The
Banking - trade encrusts a man's soul with a yellow
leprosy. However, I can't fancy that Hamlyn would
take offence at my suggesting to him that his son wants
a little rest and recreation. Suppose we push on to

THE BANKER'S. WIFE ;
Rundell's ?" said the Colonel. “I can make a pretence of
wanting money
to
pay
for my purchase, and so have a
few minutes' chat with your father in his sanctum. He'll
fancy I was afraid of alarming your mother by speaking
out, this morning, in Cavendish Square."
“With all my heart!” replied Captain Hamlyn, touch-
ing the flank of his horse as they emerged from Gray's
Inn Lane; the noble animal evincing some symptoms of
disgust at finding himself confronted by brewers' drays
and other vehicles, strange in shape and alarming in
sound to an habitual park-lounger. In spite of the
hurry and tumult, however, the Colonel sank into a
reverie, of which Henry Hamlyn and his daughter-in-law
were the leading features.
“If you give me leave, I will wait for you in the cab.
My presence would be a constraint upon your conversa-
tion with my father," said Walter, when at length they
drew up before the door of Hamlyn and Co.
A couple of minutes, however, after Colonel Hamilton
had disappeared through the swing-door, one of the
clerks made his
appearance, (taking his
pen
from behind
his ear in deference to his employer's son-and-heir, as
any other man would have touched his hat,) begging
that Captain Hamlyn would please to step out, as Colonel
Hamilton wished to speak to him.
Though Walter had a great objection to exhibit his
recherché get-up to the wonder of his father's sober
house of business, he was forced to comply.
Why, Hamlyn's not come to business yet!” cried
Colonel Hamilton, as he entered the compting-house;
" and the clerks seem to think he's been run away with
by the old brown horse, who's as likely to take a start as
Meux's brewhouse. However, I've put that smooth-
tongued fellow with the bald head out of his pain, by
telling him your father is only gone to his lawyer's, and
can't be much longer.- We must wait for him in his
own room."
Walter would rather have retreated to his cab. But
the eyes of all the clerks (except one or two who were
engaged in noting an account or numbers of bank-notes)
were fixed upon him, while Spilsby stood surveying him

293
with as close a scrutiny as though he were me
measuring
him for a coat; and had not courage to contend against
his companion's decision. They were accordingly ushered
by Spilsby into the banker's room,-cold, neat, sunless,
- with its immutable half-dozen horsehair chairs, its
faded writing-table, and old-fashioned standish.
“And you wonder, sir, that I should have disliked the
idea of wasting my life in this dreary den ?” exclaimed
Walter, casting his eyes round the untempting scene of
his father's daily labours.
“Indeed I don't!-I only wonder that you should
wonder at Harry's entertaining the same antipathy."
Captain Hamlyn's rejoinder was suspended by the re-
entrance of Spilsby, to bring Colonel Hamilton the three
hundred and fifty pounds he had asked for, and request
his signature to the receipt.-And just as the Colonel,
after having the notes told into his hand by the prag-
matical clerk, had thrust them somewhat irreverently
into his pocket-book, and his pocket-book into his pocket,
-the door was sharply opened, and Richard Hamlyn
made his appearance with a face nearly as colourless as
the paper of the notes. With a hasty glance, he ex-
amined the countenance of the three, - his son, - his
client, and the clerk, who had intruded into his dwell-
ing the preceding night; scarcely venturing to surmise
the motives which might have united such a heterogene-
ous assemblage.
But one look sufficed! However hostile Spilsby's
ulterior intentions, his master saw that, at present, all
was safe.
His own mind was in a more composed disposition
than when he had made his agitated exit from Cavendish
Square. He had been spending the interim where his
person was sacred as those of the gods, and his ipse dixit
as authoritative; the office of his solicitors, Messrs.
Crossman and Slack, who fattened upon the litigations of
Hamlyn and Co. The constituents of the banker pro-
gressed into the clients of the solicitor; the latter being
as much the excrescence of the former, as the oak-apple is
of the oak.
In his transactions with these satellites, though main-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
-
taining the dignity of the great London banker, the
rigidly upright man, - the punctual, methodical Mr.
Hamlyn, - he had been often obliged to insist on the
prosecution of petty delinquencies ;-—often compelled to
borrow the strong arm of the law to crush those wretched
defaulters, called needy men,-who, if suffered to prey
unmolested, would become fatal in the moneyed world as
the rats which in Whittington's time devoured the sub-
stance of the King of Barbary. Though a necessary,
this was not a noble occupation; and after the endless
unsavoury conferences which Hamlyn was forced to hold
with Messrs. Crossman and Slack, it was like “music after
howling” to listen to the recital of the Dartford rent-
roll, in connexion with the marriage settlements of his
Right Honourable daughter.” After the villanous
John Doe and Richard Roe-isms,-the processes of out-
lawry, — the persecutions, prosecutions, and incarcera-
tions, - which constitute the killing and wounding of
financial fight, to hear of an estate set apart in the days
of King Stephen for the dowry of the Baronesses of
Darteforde," being taxed for the future maintenance of
a spinster named Lydia Hamlyn, was indeed a triumph.
But this was not all. Scarcely had he crossed the
threshold of his house in Lombard Street, when he was
accosted with the glad tidings that a Riga House, from
which Hamlyn and Co. held bills to the amount of
£10,000, (concerning which, unsatisfactory rumours had
for a week past prevailed in the city,) was not only
solvent, but that the report which had created so much
consternation in his mind bore reference to a Schreiber
and Co., of Archangel, with whom they had no concern.
Had the head-clerk been in the compting-house at the
moment of his transit, this gratifying intelligence might
have been held suspended over his head. But Spilsby
being engaged with Colonel Hamilton, one of the juniors,
who loved and was grateful to his master, communicated
the glad tidings, breathless with joy.
The tranquillized banker was accordingly able to listen
with serenity to the representations of Colonel Hamilton;
and as it happened to suit bis plans that Henry should
not commence his duties in the House till after Christo

mas, he had no difficulty in sitting down before them to
indite a paternal epistle to his son; offering him every
pecuniary facility towards absenting himself from Cam-
bridge for the recovery of his health, by perfect leisure
or continental travel.
For this sacrifice, he was repaid by the affectionate
warmth with which Walter started up to press the hand
engaged in conferring a benefit upon his brother; while
old Hamilton rubbed his own with glee, at the idea of
the surprise which Harry's unexpected arrival in town
would occasion to Ellen.
“You're made of more penetrable stuff than I thought
for, my dear Hamlyn!” cried he. “But I fancy the
best way we can reward you for your concession, is by
making ourselves scarce. So give me the letter, and we'll
post it as we go
home.”
“ Are you afraid I should repent, and recall it, or that
it will not be safe in our letter-box?" demanded the
banker, with a smile.
“Not I!- But I'm come to an age when a bird in
hand is worth ten in the bush; which is the reason I'm
not sorry we're to see the colour of my friends Moonjee
and Company's hundred and twenty thousand pounds,
before another month goes over our heads !-And so,
good bye tye."
Thus released, the banker was preparing to apply him-
self to the daily business which his unusual absence left
at odds, enjoying in every fibre the delicious conscious-
ness of relief from pecuniary pressure, when the white
head of the old gentleman was again thrust in, with
“Another word, my dear Hamlyn !-Your clerks yonder
are sending off a poor fellow, on the plea of your being
engaged, whom I've a notion you won't be sorry that I've
laid
my
hands on!”
And the Colonel advanced into the room, followed by
Walter and a stout-looking man in a round coat with
corduroys and leather gaiters, whose costume afforded as
singular a contrast to the trimly spruceness of Captain
Hamlyn, as his wholesome, healthy, open countenance to
the care-withered face of his father.
“Here, Durdan, here!” cried the Colonel. “I told

296
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
ye I thought we'd pioneer the way for you into the
presence of the great man!" And to Hamlyn's great
annoyance, Colonel Hamilton evinced no intention of
allowing the audience to be a private one.
“Sarvant, Mr. Hamlyn, sir !” said the farmer, taking
the seat hesitatingly offered him by the banker, while
the Colonel resumed his, and Walter stationed himself
on the hearthrug, with ill-repressed impatience. “The
Col'nel here's been so friendly as to say you'd give me a
hearing on a little matter o’ business."
“ With the greatest pleasure, Durdan!" replied
Hamlyn, assuming an air of affability, closely imitated
from that with which, in Downing Street, he was habi-
tually received by Lord Crawley. “ Is there anything in
which I can serve you ?”
“I'm obliged to you, sir, nothing! To speak plain,
Mr. Hamlyn, I've railed it up from Ov'ngton mainly to
be of sarvice to you. You've heard, no doubt, sir, that
my matters be a going contrairy. But 'tis an ill wind as
blows no man good; and I take it you'll be summut the
better for Jacob Durdan's downfall.”..
“I am sorry to hear you apply so decided a word to
your affairs,” replied the banker, placing his hands with
an air of dignified composure on the elbows of his arm-
chair. “But I trust, Durdan, they may still look up."
“ Not they, nor their master neither!" replied the
farmer, doggedly.
“I am truly concerned to hear you say so, Durdan!
but-
“No great call, sir, for you to trouble yourself about
the matter!" interrupted the farmer, shrugging his
shoulders, with the impatience of a man whom misfortune
has rendered mistrustful. “ You and I've been uncom-
fortable neighbours, Mr. Hamlyn. But that's over now!
Shan't trouble nobody at Ovington much longer. So,
whether you liked my dealings, or I your'n, don't much
matter to neither.”
"I can assure you, Durdan, that as far as regards that
little trespass business-
“No matter, sir, no matter. You stayed proceedings,
at the request o' the good Col'nel yonder, and there's an

297
end on't! Maybe, if I'd been better up in the world,
they'd never been begun.”
But for the presence of Colonel Hamilton, the banker
would probably have put a speedy end to an interview
that opened so unsatisfactorily. But the old man kept
nodding and winking beseechingly at him, to bespeak
indulgence towards a poor fellow, harassed by adversity
out of his good manners.
“The thing's this, Mr. Hamlyn,” resumed Durdan,
after gulping down an uneasy feeling in his throat—“my
farm's in the market; and"
“You are looking out for a purchaser, eh! Durdan ?”
Contrairy, sir,- purchasers be a looking out for me.
There's Squire Barlow been a haggling with me, like a
Jew pedlar, ever since the news of my misfortun', (a'ter
the burning o' the Liverpool warehouses; with my last
consignment o' corn, uninsured;) and I've a letter in my
pocket from a Leamington 'torney, with an offer from
one Shears, as has reilized a mint o' money in the
licensed vict’ling line, and wants to set up for gemman,
and build himself one o' them quality mousetraps they
call a villa, on the ruins o'th' old farm !"
Richard Hamlyn majestically shifted the crossing of
his legs at the idea of such a Shears, Esquire, established
in a Shears Lodge under the very nose of Dean Park.
“Provided you get a long price for your land, Durdan,"
said Colonel Hamilton, “what's the odds ? The colour
of one man's money is the same as another's!"
Why the odds is this, Colonel,” replied the farmer,
turning with a milder aspect towards the neighbour
with whose partridges and pheasants he had been
allowed to make acquaintance. “Ours ben't a county
o' new comers, Colonel. You've seen the Bear and
Ragged Staff moniments in War'ick church, and the
Vernin moniments at Brax'am; and you've, maybe,
heard Squire Grat'ycke o' Grat'ycke tell o' his ancestors
being knights o' the shire summas about the time os
County Guy o' Guy's Cliff, or thereabouts. Even Squire
Barlow, though forced to take wages as looker to Lord
Vernin, have parchments to show for the lordship o' the
manor of Ald'r'am, dating from days when Papists and

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
Protestants were roasting o' one another in Smithfield
Market. All this you know better nor I; for never was
there a 'sizes these county gentlefolks didn't take care to
din it in your ears !"
Walter Hamlyn began to testify signs of impatience
by a vigorous poke of the fire; but his father, looking
round, quieted him by a reproving glance.
"Well, sir! if so be these grander folks are proud o'
having a deep-struck root in the county, (for what roots
be stronger than the dead we lay in the soil, from
generation to generation ?) I've just as great a call to
think much o' the Durdans having been yeomen on their
own land, as my title-deeds will prove, from the time my
ancestor with his family and farming-men joined old
Crom'ell at the battle of Edge'ill. Durdan's Farm, Mr.
Hamlyn, has its name in the county as well as Ken’l-
worth or War’ick Castle; and if so be I'm forced by the
badness o' the times to part with what's as close to me
as the blood in my veins, I'd rather make a worse
bargain, sir, and be sure th' old farm should stand, and
th' old name o' Durdan's bold good, than have a pot-
house-keeper's son making a heap oʻrubbish o' the roof
I was born under, and blotting my father's name out o'
the county, as though 't had ought to be 'shamed on!”
“Bravo, Durdan!
-Well said, old Trojan!" cried the
Colonel. “ There's more pluck in that speech, man,
than in all the gammon ever spouted on the hustings by
all the Vernons in the shire! But can't matters be
brought about, think ye, to prevent your parting with it
at all? A mortgage--now?-If a good heavy mort-
gage
* Thank ye, Colonel—thank ye heartily and kindly,"
interrupted Jacob Durdan, in a more subdued voice,
now that, having exhaled the spirit of his pride, the
reality of his position forced itself anew upon his mind.
Everything's been done as could be done to put off the
evil day,--that is, everything in honesty. No doubt I
might shuffle on, with the chance o' coming to a break
at last. But never should I get a wink o' sleep on my
pillow, if I thought there was a chance of e'er a man
living being the worse for my father's son. Mr. Hamlyn

here can understand that. Mr. Hamlyn, who knows
that the great name borne by Old England in her public
dealings is maintained by the proud hearts of millions o'
rough, hard-worded fellows, as little thought on by lords
and ladies as I be."
Thus appealed to, the conscience-stricken Richard
Hamlyn muttered inarticulately one of those claptraps
about the unblemished national probity of Great Britain,
which he usually reserved for his speeches from the
Chair at city-meetings, or his place in the House of
Commons.
“Case is this, Col'nel!" resumed Durdan, turning
short towards the only person present for whom he
entertained sufficient respect to care about the impression
he was making. “When father died, he left matters at
sixes and sevens. I was a young fellow, sir, with a family
o younger brothers and sisters to purvide for; so, as in
duty bound tow'rd the old man I'd laid in the grave,
who'd fit a good fight for us all so long as body and soul
held together, I worked hard for 'em all, and lived
sparingly. And what's more, I guv up thoughts of
marrying (as most young fellows o'
my age
have a mind
to) till I'd put 'em all out in life, having first and fore-
most shackled myself with a gnawing worm of a mort-
gage. For I didn't feel the property my own, so long
as e'er a soul living had a right to say that old Jacob
Durdan as was dead and gone had left a shilling in
Till I paid my father's debts, I lived without
salt to my porridge; but my porridge tasted none the
worse for that, I promise you!"
By this time, the irritation of Richard Hamlyn was
excited almost beyond bounds by these cruel rebukes;
the more so, that he saw even the levity of his son sub-
dued into respect toward the honest man before him;
while Colonel Hamilton kept passing his hand across
his shaggy eyebrows in a manner which there was
no sunbeam straggling into that dreary apartment to
account for.
"And so, gen'lemen," resumed Durdan, "finding that
late and early work, saving and sparing, don't suffice to
make head again the badness o' the times, sooner than
arrears.

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
bring disgrace to an honest name, by getting into the
Gazette, I've made up my mind to sell,--pay every
shillin' in the pound, --and as to living on a crust,
why that I've done a'ready, without grumblin'! And
knowin' Squire Hamlyn was once thinkin' o' the farm,
and that if we come to a deal he'd be for keepin' up
th' old homestead, and leavin' it th' old name o’Durdan's
Farm, so that my nephys and nieces may know, fifty
years hence, there was once a property in the family
where their forefathers was born and died, I've giv' no
answer to Barlow, nor to Shears, 'fore I inquired if so be
it suited
you,
sir, to come down with the money.”
Richard Hamlyn budged not so much as an eyelash in
reply to this appeal; for, with the incredulity of a
grovelling mind towards every nobler sentiment, he
doubted not that the rude eloquence of Jacob Durdan
was a get up, to raise the price of his farm.
But Colonel Hamilton was more generous. Steering
the intermediate course between the severity of the man
of business and the tenderness of the man of feeling, he
inquired, in plain English, the value set by the farmer on
his property
“You must tell us exactly what you ask for the old
house and land, Durdan," said he,"before your proposals
can be entertained.”
“I know what old Squire Hamlyn offered my father
for ’em,” rejoined the farmer, “when first as ever he en-
closed the Dean lands into a park. But land's worth
half as much again now-a-days, let alone that the farm's
gained a mint in value by that same enclosure. How-
ever, I'm no great dab at figures, or may be I should
have made a better job o' my affairs; and the best way o’
coming to the pint as to price, gen'lemen, is to show you
Squire Barlow's offer, and the letters o' the Leamington
’torney, leaving you to judge what offers you choose to
make. On'y not to misguide you with the notion that I
want to ris the valu' upon you by the threat of an un-
pleasant neighbour, I tell you fairly, Mr. Hamlyn, that.
though at sixes and sevens in my accounts, I'd sooner
take a trifle less from you than more from either op
t’others, on the consideration afore mentioned."

“And I can candidly assure you, Durdan," replied the
banker, gravely, “ that had it suited me to make the
pur-
chase at all, a few hundreds, more or less, would not have
been the object to deter me. But I am sorry to say, the
disastrous position of the commercial world compels every
man engaged in business to hold his resources at his dis-
posal; and, even if the present depreciated value of agri-
cultural produce were not sufficiently alarming to all
landed proprietors, I should"
“In one word, sir,” said Durdan, rising from his seat,
and buttoning up the coat which the rousing fire stirred
up by Captain Hamlyn had compelled him to open in the
heat of his explanations—“in one word, you're not dis-
posed to come down ? Well, sir, in that case, having
done my dooty to all parties, I have only to close with
the gen'leman in the 'Delphi, to whom Squire Barlow's
referred me as empowered to examine the title-deeds for
Lord Vernin. No offence, sir, I hope for ’trudin' on your
time; and I wish you heartily your health, Colonel
Ham’lton, in case I should be out o' the country afore
your return to the Manor !
If I might make bold, and
the breed o' white peacocks could be accept'ble, Colinel,
(which you and the young lady admired so much the day
you druv over to Durdan's,) I'd ask you the favour,
Col'nel, to let me send 'em over to Burlin’ton in place o'
being sold with the stock ?"
While Colonel Hamilton was thankfully acknowledging
this farewell act of neighbourly courtesy on the part of
the unfortunate farmer, the mind of Richard Hamlyn was
becoming distracted between the idea of the molestations
likely to be practised upon him by Barlow of Alderham,
fighting under the banner of all the Vernons, and his
dread lest the prying Spilsby should be at that moment
stationed between the double doors dividing the compting-
house from the parlour, obtaining further insight into his
financial dilemmas. He was roused from his abstraction
by the voice of Walter.
“Might it not be as well, sir," inquired his son, “ to
think over these proposals, with reference to the Burling-
ton property, if not to your own ? At all events, among
your moneyed friends, it might be possible to find an

advantageous purchaser for Durdan's more agreeable to
your feelings than either this Leamington innkeeper, or
the agent of Lord Vernon ?"
"Mr. Durdan, you see, is pressed to conclude,” replied
his father, much vexed that the explanation of his private
affairs should have occurred in presence of his son and
Colonel Hamilton. “ I should otherwise have been glad
to take the matter into consideration."
“My father would be glad to take the matter into
further consideration, sir," hastily repeated Captain Ham-
lyn, interrupting the civilities exchanging between Jacob
Ďurdan and his Lord of the Manor. “Would it be incon-
venient to you to leave the matter open for a day or two ?”
"I couldn't, in course, Capt'n Hamlyn, expect a
gentleman to be ready with his "ay' or 'no' at a pinch, in
a matter of so many thousands," replied the farmer. "In-
convenienced I must be, any way.
But if the Colonel
here will answer for’t to give me Squire Hamlyn's answer
by Thursday's post, I'll neither_meddle nor make with
the men' o' business till then. For if once a plain man,
as I be, gets springed in the noose of their palaver, bis
neck will be wrung round, or a nail druv through his
words, afore he knows where he is; and so, in course, I'd
rather deal with gentlefolks whose yea is yea, and nay is
nay! What say ye, Colonel ? Will
you stand
so far as act atween me and the Squire ?"
“With all my heart, Durdan!" cried the good old man.
“ I'd give many a groat you were able to stand the upshot,
and keep the farm in your hands. But if not, God forbid
I should have my keepers snarling and yelping from
month's-end to month's-end like their own terriers,
with e'er a Jack in office in the employ of my lord

mount of The Hyde! And now, let's all be off and leave
this gentleman to his concerns! You'll find Johnston
and his wife at the Hotel in St. James's Street, if you'll
look in; though, by George, they'd be puzzled to offer
you such cheer as you set afore me and Ellen, the day we

CHAPTER XX.
“I have toil'd and till'd and sweaten in the sun
According to the curse : must I do more?
For what should I be gentle ?-for a war
With all the elements, ere they will yield
The bread we eat?--For what must I be grateful ?
For being dust, and grovelling in the dust,
Till I return to dust?"-BYRON.
A WHOLE hour's deliberation over these contending em-
barrassments, did not suffice to restore the banker to
composure. He saw clearly that his hesitation to effect
a purchase so important to the value of his property as
Durdan's farm, must excite the surprise, and eventually
the misgivings, of both Colonel Hamilton and his son ;
and, difficult as it might be to complete the necessary
arrangements at that moment, he felt that, if within the
scope of possibility, the purchase must be accom-
plished.
Richard Hamlyn had now attained one of those crises,
when a man is driven to measures such as, in cool blood,
he would repudiate as rash and unaccomplishable. Just
as a physician will redeem at the last gasp, by some
frantic stroke, the life of a patient with which for months
he has been tampering, -or rather, just as a man pursued
by an assassin will direct his flying steps across a broken
bridge or crumbling wall, did the banker suddenly make
up his mind to an act of desperation.
"That man secured, all might yet be well with me!"
was his train of reasoning. * Recruited by these timely
succours, and having the certainty of a noble return from
my South American speculations, I might yet replace all
the missing securities,--the Burlington Trust-money,
Hamilton's, -all, all, --if I could secure the silence of
Spilsby, and obtain time for my affairs to come round.
Something must be done! To struggle day after day
within the coil of that serpent, I neither can nor will. I
feel blasted in mind and body by his pestiferous breath.

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
A death by slow poison,-a conscious death,-a gradual
decay of the flesh and the spirit,-were not more loath-
some than to be waited upon by his clammy touch,
haunted by his stealthy step,-addressed by his mealy
voice,-watched by his cunning eye. By the God of
heaven! my breath seems stifled when I think of him!”
And in the irritation of his soul, with a sudden jerk he
pulled the bell beside his writing-table.
“Send Spilsby hither!” cried he, to the counting-house
porter, who answered his summons, a coal-scuttle in his
hand.
The head-clerk, who, conscious for some days past of
his extended and extending power over his employer, had
noticed with triumph Mr. Hamlyn's dexterous avoidance
of a tête-à-tête, could scarcely believe his ears when thus
summoned. Delivering to one of the juniors the bill of
exchange he was filling up for the signature of an ex-
pectant customer, he turned down the wrist of his coat,
and settled his collar, as if proceeding to an audience of
some man in power. The altered countenance of Mr.
Hamlyn as he entered the counting-house in the morning,
had not been lost upon him. He felt confident that a
decisive blow was to be struck between them. But, un-
like his master, Spilsby's feelings were undisturbed by
the prospect of the collision. He was as cool, -as malig-
nantly cool, -as a
“toad that under the cold stone
Days and nights hath thirty-one,
Sweltering venom sleeping got;"—
and it was with his usual hardened air of self-reliance he
entered the parlour of the banker.
In the interim, though but the lapse of a few minutes
had occurred, the agitation of Richard Hamlyn bad
attained a pitch which caused his heart to beat as with
the strokes of a hammer; and sent the blood throbbing
into his head, till his shot eyeballs assumed a terrible
appearance.
The moment the bald-headed clerk closed the door
cautiously behind him, Hamlyn advanced with hurried
footsteps, bolted it, and put the key into his pocket.

“Sit down, sir!" said he, addressing the astonished
Spilsby, in a hoarse voice,-how different from the con-
ciliating blandishment with which for weeks past he had
accosted him!
“ Sit down, sir !" said he again, in a still more peremp-
tory manner,-perceiving Spilsby hesitate,—not from
respect, but the dread perhaps of seeing a knife glitter in
the hands, or a pistol concealed under the blotting-book
of the desperate man he was confronting. “It is time
that
you
and I understood each other!”
The bald-headed clerk began to mutter something
about his earnest hope that no misunderstanding had ever
occurred, or was likely to occur,
between them.
“ None! I shall take care that none occur!” said
Hamlyn, in the same hoarse, unnatural, concentrated
voice. “I know that you are my enemy. Your menacing
looks
pursue me to
my calm fireside, -molest me in the
bosom of my family,-frustrate the discharge of my par-
liamentary duties, -and render my life a penalty and a
curse !-You could not suppose I should long endure
this ?-As I said before,—'tis time we understood each
other!”
“I should be extremely sorry, Mr. Hamlyn,” faltered
the clerk, affecting to humour the distracted mood of his
employer, “if any inadvertence in my conduct had given
rise to impressions of failure of respect."
“ You lie, sir!" interrupted the banker. “There has
been no inadvertence. Your least movement is calcu-
lated, -your slightest word is instinct with cunning.-I
see through you, Spilsby,--see through you like a pane
of ill-favoured, cloudy glass !-And you fancy you see
through me. But you are mistaken. There are recesses
in my mind and conduct which one like you can never
penetrate ; and into those, I am at any moment able to
dive, and defy you.-Do you
hear
me, Mr. Spilsby!-to
defy you!”
The interpellation seemed almost needful; for the
head-clerk had the appearance of being stultified by the
explosion of this unlooked-for storm. It was the first
time in the course of their long connexion that he had
seen the banker in the slightest degree disturbed; and

to behold him thus convulsed by struggling passion, was
as if the gates of hell had opened before him.
“I tell you,” persisted the banker, coming closer
towards him, and lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper,
as if it suddenly occurred to him that the conference
might be overheard by others as crafty as themselves,-
“I tell you that, like the fish which, when pursued, has
the faculty of discolouring the surrounding waters to
baffle its enemies, were you to execute your evil designs
towards me, I would so perturb and trouble all which
surrounds me, that you, sir, you yourself, should be
involved, within an inch of the gallows, in our common
ruin!—This is no jest, no idle menace !-You have no
more conception of the extent to which my schemes
extend, than you have of the nature of your share in the
embezzlement which, at this moment, places you in my
power!"
At this accusation, every vestige of colour forsook the
cheeks and lips of Spilsby. Though an artful, he was
by no means a strong-minded man; nor, indeed, have
powerful minds ever resort to the cunning which charac-
terized his habits. He was accordingly overawed by the
audacity of Hamlyn's tone, and the ferocity of his denun-
ciations. With the worst opinion of his employer, he
believed him capable of having placed the golden cup in
the mouth of Benjamin's sack, for the purpose of accusa-
tion.-By what effort of legerdemain Hamlyn had replaced
the missing securities, justifying such bold defiance, he
could not conjecture. But he had little doubt that the
same nefarious machinations which had extricated the
banker, might have transferred supposititious guilt to
himself.
“I assure you, sir,” pleaded he, with the humblest
deprecation, " that I am neither your enemy, nor your
defrauder. If I have been so unfortunate as to offend
you by declining the consular appointment you were so
generous as to procure me, I am willing to prove my
zeal by accepting it."
"A well-imagined submission, truly, knowing that it
is filled up!No, sir!-It would no longer suit me to
lose your valuable services ;--that is," continued Hamlyn,

with a grim smile,“ to lose sight of you. Here you
must abide, Mr. Spilsby. You told me, the other day,
that such was your wish—that you desired no better.
Your ambition shall be fulfilled. And now, listen to
me-listen to a plain statement which involves your
vital interests. You fancy you have a hold over me;
that I have committed myself by lapses of discretion,-
nay, why not speak out ?- breaches of honesty-of
equity--that place me in your power. Suppose this
granted. What do you pretend to gain by the denuncia-
tion ?-Will my customers thank you for the announce-
ment of the abstraction of what you have it not in your
power to replace ?-If this house were closed to-morrow,
what are you the better for its bankruptcy ?-You lose
your salary, your situation, your respectability. Other
houses of business would be cautious of engaging a head-
clerk out of a house that has disgraced itself; more
especially a Judas—a Judas, sir --who has attempted
to sell his master. You would be placeless, homeless,
friendless; ay! and, in the sequel, perhaps, emulate the
tardy repentance of that same Iscariot, who went and
hanged himself!"
"If I entertained views or intentions, sir, of the vile
nature you describe," said Spilsby, in a low, broken
tone-for he was thoroughly unmanned -“I should
deserve these insinuations. But really.
“ If you do not,” retorted Hamlyn, " you will have the
less hesitation in acceding to the terms I am about
to propose to you. Your salary in my establishment
amounts, I fancy, to four hundred
per
annum ?"
“ To four hundred."
“It is my intention to double it. I have here a paper
awaiting your signature. It contains only a few lines,
and need cost you little deliberation. You will find
yourself required to pledge yourself to secrecy, public
and private, with regard to the affairs of the house, (which
you admit to be fully known to you,) on condition of
receiving the sum of eight hundred pounds per annum,
paid quarterly; and a further douceur of two hundred
guineas, every Christmas, according as you may refrain
from harassing me by petty irritations. If you fancy

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
me likely to compromise our mutual animosity by a large
sum in ready money, you are mistaken. I have neither
the power nor the will. Make up your mind, therefore,
to accept a handsome competence,-one thousand a
year-at my hands, so long as the house shall keep
open; or do your worst-ruin it and me
-if you can,
and abide the consequences which I swear to you are
at this moment impending over your head!"
The clerk almost gasped for breath. There was some-
thing in the desperation of Hamlyn that seemed to
cleave him to the earth! His tongue grew dry within
his mouth, till he was almost incapable of utterance. To
have called for help, overmastered the incensed man
before him, and, exposed to the arbitration of the law the
antagonism between them, would only accelerate the
catastrophe of which he stood in awe. Spilsby felt
convinced that, at his first movement, the frantic banker
would rush upon him and lay him dead at his feet.
On the other hand, the terms of pacification offered
exce-ded his hopes. Without foreseeing exactly to what
degree he might implicate himself in a felony by his avowal
of foreknowledge of the acts of Hamlyn and Co., the
prospect of an income of a thousand a-year was El dorado
to the clerk. Pentonville and lodgings disappeared be-
fore him. He saw himself grown “respectable -a house-
holder- living cleanly and “keeping a gig;" bringing up
his sons to the learned professions, and his daughters at
a boarding-school.
And Hamlyn saw plainly the advantage he had gained.
Already, his heel was upon the head of the serpent!
“Your stipend is due on the first of next month, I
think ?” said the banker. “ The first quarterly instal-
ment lies before you," said he, placing two hundred-
pound notes beside the paper he had hastily drawn up,
at the receipt of which you will have the goodness to ac-
knowledge on the same sheet. Make up your mind, Mr.
Spilsby!- I have no time to waste upon its vacillations.'
The bald-headed clerk cast a hurried, haggard glance
around the chamber, as if expecting its dingy walls to
emit counsellors for his dilemma. He would have given
half the amount before him for an hour's leisure for the

309
arrangement of his ideas. But this delay squared not
with the policy of his master. Five minutes afterwards,
the notes were in Spilsby's pocket. The paper, duly
signed, was deposited in the desk of the banker, and a
mountain removed from the breast of Richard Hamlyn!
“And now, Spilsby," said he, with difficulty restrain-
ing his desire to cry aloud for joy in the fulness of his
heart, when, released from its agonizing tension, the
blood gradually returned to its usual channels, “we per-
fectly understand each other. If not friends, we are at
least confederates for life,-confederates whose well-
being is bound up in mutual conciliation. I shall receive
you with all the consideration due to your confidential
position in my establishment; and be all trace of this
interview banished between us ! Nothing on my part
shall ever recall a disagreeable impression to your mind.
From you I expect similar forbearance."
“I trust, sir, I shall never lose sight of the deference
becoming my helpless dependence upon you!” replied
Spilsby, gradually recovering the power of thinking, feel-
ing, and speaking. “I would fain this explanation had
never taken place. But I have had no choice in the
matter. All I now desire is, that it may be obliterated
from
your remembrance, as I shall strive to efface it from
mine."
Thus ended this fearful struggle for life and death;
and no one who saw Richard Hamlyn upon 'Change that
afternoon, sedate and courteous, receiving the congratu-
lations of his intimates on the good news from Riga, and
exchanging with the mere men of business with whom
he was in connexion the usual forms and negociations of
the day, (while stockbrokers respectfully uncapped as
he glanced their way, and many a gray-headed man of
double his years stood aside with reverence for the passage
of the righteous-overmuch promoter of half the charitable
institutions of the metropolis,) would have assigned the
smallest credit to the asseverations of the bald-headed
clerk, had he sworn on the Gospels in presence of the
assembled magistrature of the city, to the truth of the
scene described in the foregoing pages.
But life is full of contradictions. Could we behold the

individuals with whom we live in habits of social inter-
course, in the closer relations of life and at all hours of
the day, how few of us but would start back with surprise,
in many instances with horror, on recognising our utter
ignorance of their real natures and pursuits. Nor is this
altogether the result of human hypocrisy; human folly
bas a considerable share in the illusion. We see people
through the medium of our prejudices, as often as through
that of their pretensions; endowing them with imaginary
virtues for our worship, or supposititious vices for our
abhorrence; and, when disabused in our gratuitous error,
visit upon them the flights of our imaginations. Yet the
lover who chooses to elevate the lady of his thoughts into
a divinity, has no right to resent her proving herself a
mere mortal; nor the public to create unto itself idols,
for the purpose of eventually knocking into dust their
puppets of wood or images of clay.
It was scarcely the fault of the honourable member
for Barthorpe, if the London world, after admiring for
twenty years the benevolence of his character, the excel-
lence of his establishment, the perfection of his equipages,
the activity of his parliamentary career, the liberality of
his private, should choose to elevate him into the most
virtuous of mankind; one who might have been Bishop
Heber the apostle, had he not been Hamlyn the
banker!
The dinner-party which took place that day in Caven-
dish Square was citable for its elegance and pleasantness,
even among the brilliant banquets succeeding each other
in what the newspapers chose to term “the hospitable
family mansion of Mr. Hamlyn.” The party was not
large. The Marchioness of Dartford, an habitual invalid,
disliking noise and strangers, was charmed with the gentle
serenity of Mrs. Hamlyn, and her new daughter-in-law;
of whoin Lady Rotherwood did the honours to her sister,
as though she were a child of her own. Colonel Hamil-
ton and Ellen, with Lord Crawley and Walter, completed
the party; and Lord Vernon might have judged it a
sufficient reason for dismissing his French cook, and re-
nouncing forced fruit and vegetables for the remainder of
the season, could he have witnessed the refinement of a
;

repast which demonstrated the vulgarity of distinctions
that could be successfully emulated by a banker.
Lord Crawley, who had not seen his sister since her
illness, seemed to take particular delight in a reunion
occurring under circumstances so auspicious. Always
sociable, the home-secretary was unusually anecdotic and
agreeable; either in compliment to the bappy position of
his nephew, as an object of disinterested affection to such a
family; or to the bright eyes of Mrs. Hamilton, whom he
beheld for the first time, and hailed with enthusiasm,
even before he discovered her to be the heiress of the old
Nabob, who had given him so valuable a lesson in Indian
policy, (seasoned with elephantisms,) at Dean Park.
“I believe you mean to provide wives for our whole
family, my dear Mrs. Hamlyn!" whispered Lady Rother-
wood, to the banker's wife, after dinner. “Not content
with finding the dearest little Marchioness for my nephew,
you have placed in my brother's way the only woman I
ever saw likely to distract his attention from the interests
of public life. I never knew Crawley smitten before !"
Mrs. Hamlyn smiled, and of course disclaimed, as she
glanced towards Ellen; who, to allow more freedom of
speech to the family party, had retreated into the little
boudoir full of engravings, wherein that fatal compact
had been made between the home-secretary and the master
of the house. But the smile was a hollow one. Mrs.
Hamlyn heard with the natural jealousy of a mother, any
allusion to a new conquest effected by the object of her
Henry's adoration.
A new scene of triumph, meanwhile, was commencing
for Lydia. The Marchioness of Dartford, an accomplished
musician, and devoted to the art, but debarred by the
state of her health from attending operas and concerts,
and consequently a stranger to the chef-d'oeuvres of mo-
dern harmony, was full of delight at the masterly per-
formance of her daughter-in-law. The duets from the
“ Lucia,” and “Norma,” executed by Lydia and Ellen
with a degree of perfection rarely attained by non-pro-
fessional singers, drew tears from her eyes; and before
the close of “ Deh! con te," ord Crawley and Walter
were standing with Dartford behind the piano, in ecsta-

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
cies, real or pretended, almost as great as those of the
genuine amateur; a circumstance laughingly pointed out
by Colonel Hamilton to his friend the banker, as they
entered the brilliantly lighted drawing-room together.
Was it likely that a man thus situated,-in the enjoy-
ment of every social pleasure, every social distinction,
should have leisure to reflect on the morrow with due
solicitude upon his responsibilities towards his hundreds
of clients ;-to ponder upon the interests of such people
as the Vicar's family, the children of a physician in Rus-
sell Square, the widow Darley in Lemon-Tree Yard, or
Sir Robert Maitland in the Hebrides ;—the annuity of
Miss Creswell, the governess, or the compound interest
of the Ovington Savings Bank! Astonishing, indeed,
had he so much as deigned to recognise the existence of
such nonentities, while entertaining with their means,
and by the wasting of their substance, the future relatives
and present friends of the Marchioness, his right honour-
able daughter.
“Has your ladyship heard that Hamlyn the banker 18
likely to be created Lord Scrip, in the next batch of
peers ?" inquired Flimflam, of Lady Vernon, (beside
whom he had manœuvred himself into a seat at dinner,
that day, at a dinner-party at the house of one of her
Northumberland neighbours, in hopes of worming himself
into her good graces.)
“ A joke, of course!" replied Lady Vernon, who, know-
ing Mr. Flimflam to be a person engaged to supply the
small talk of dinner-parties, as Gunter is engaged to
furnish bonbons for the dessert, conceived that such a
man could not open his lips without a latent pun.
"A jest, likely to prove earnest, " rejoined the pro-
fessional diner-out. "Amazing, how those Hamlyns are
getting on; and, we may add, their sons and daughters
getting off! That pretty simple-looking daughter has
netted the best match of the season; and the son is about
to marry a widow with twenty thousand a-year, who has
lately refused some nobleman's son for the bright eyes of
that young coxcomb, Captain Hamlyn of the Blues."
Lady Vernon winced. Her withers were grievously
wrung. That morning, she had heard the first whisper of

Alberic's humiliating rejection; and had long looked on
Walter as a passable pis-aller for Lucinda. The heir of
Dean Park was a bagged fox whom it did them no harm
to secure, in case better game were wanting,
“I must say,” resumed Flimflam, (a professional man
of infinitesimal calibre,) "that nothing appears to me
more absurd than the position assumed in society by
bankers, above other mercantile men. Dealers in silver
and gold are not a bit the less dealers, because the queen's
countenance is stamped on their merchandise; and why
should royal visits and invitations be vouchsafed to the
Hamlyns, more than to other people in business ?”
“ Royal notice is often bestowed for specific purposes,
interrupted Lady Vernon, overlooking the audacity of
the insect that buzzed so familiarly in her ears, in con-
sideration of the conservative tendency of his sarcasms.
“But in the county in which Mr. Hamlyn's father chose
to purchase an estate, they are still looked upon as
parvenus. Lord Vernon considers them highly respectable
people, who do much good in their way. But Mr. and
Mrs. Hamlyn stand in a very different light in their own
neighbourhood, and among the London crowd, which has
less time to take accurate measure of their pretensions."
“Oh! as to London, retorted Flimflam,“
as your
ladyship justly observes, in the present disordered state
of the social system, people go where they are amused,
without asking by whom, or caring how. If Madame
Laffarge were to open a fine house in Grosvenor Square
with the best music and best suppers of the season, she
would be visited by everybody. At the end of a year or
two, were her music and suppers to become less good,
they would pretend they had never heard of her name,
till she was forced upon their acquaintance by Lady
So-and-So. It is not every one who preserves, on such
points, the rigid sense of dignity exercised in so exemplary
a manner by your ladyship."
“What possible object could I have," gravely resumed
Lady Vernon, “in cultivating the acquaintance of people
like the Hamlyns ? They have everything to gain from
me;-I, nothing to gain from them.”
“Why, as your ladyship justly observes," replied Flim-

flam," the show and ostentation of such an establishment
as theirs, a mere advertisement in large capitals of the
solidity of the firm, though highly attractive to the vulgar,
is the very thing to disgust persons of refinement. Í
have dined occasionally at Hamlyn's, (with whom I have
parliamentary business that necessitates a sort of ac-
quaintance,) and confess nothing strikes me more than
the contrast afforded by his flashy table to those of cer-
tain of the old, and,--if I may presume to say so,-old-
fasbioned nobility, such as the Duke of Saxmundham,-
the Marquis of Oxgraze,-the Earl of Titheprig-
“ The Duke of Saxmundham is an uncle of mine,
Lord Titheprig my brother-in-law !" observed Lady Ver-
non, fancying she was communicating news to Flimflam,
who bowed in grateful acknowledgment till his gray toupet
touched the table-cloth.
“ At Hamlyn's," he resumed,“ one is dazzled by excess
of light, and the newness of the plate,-as if the host
cared only to prove the amount of his credit with his
jeweller and wax-chandler! The comfort of his guests is
never thought of. Shaded lights, that would fail to ex-
hibit the lustre of his silver wine-cistern, a man like
Hamlyn would not hear of.”
“For my part, I detest that sort of over-frosted fancy
plate, which looks as if it had just escaped from Hancock's
window !” sneered Lady Vernon. “It is like publishing
by sound of trumpet that you are a man of yesterday.”
Then, the dinner itself,” resumed Flimflam, (whose
rancour was excited against Hamlyn by having had it
repeated to him by his bosom-enemy, the learned Theban
of the Temple, that the banker had denounced him to
Lord Crawley, on issuing from his last dinner-party, as
a failure,'') “the dinner itself is in what I consider
the worst taste. Everything garnished, -everything à la
something or other. Such gilding of refined gold, and
painting the lily! Turbot à la Tartare, faisan à l'estragon!
As if the simple flavour of the best things in the world
were not sufficient to bribe the beau monde to dine with
a banker!”
People tired of their plain roast venison, at home,

cooks of London, no matter with whom they may be
living,” observed Lady Vernon.
“And at Hamlyn's, one is at least sure of novelty,”
added Flimflam. “He receives his canvas-back ducks
regularly from his Correspondent at New York."
" I suppose there is a game-bag attached to his letter-
bag," observed Lady Vernon, with a sneer.
“And, as your ladyship is probably aware, he cultivates,
in the succession-houses at Dean Park, tropical fruits,
which are grown nowhere else in England ;-about as
good eating as the waxen fruit of an epergne,
with
sugar
sifted over it.”
“ Very good things to exhibit at a Horticultural Show,
that his own and his gardener's name may figure in the
papers,” observed Lady Vernon. “But I own I am
humble enough to be contented with a Providence pine.'
“ Even the pines, at Hamlyn's," resumed Flimflam,
are served as I never saw them in other houses. The
pine-stands are of gold, with long, burnished, pendent
leaves like those of the natural fruit."
“ Disgusting!” exclaimed Lady Vernon. “Nothing
more offensive than contact between fruit and plate,
which is cleaned with substances fatal to the flavour.
Fruit should be served exclusively on glass or china—"
“ Not by a banker!" retorted Flimflam, with a venom-
“Gold (often, I am afraid, gilding) is the
emblem of his calling,—the outward and visible sign of
his inward disgrace. For, after all, as your ladyship
justly observes, what can be more suspicious than the
colossal fortune (even if a solid colossal fortune, and not
a mere colossal credit) of a great banker? By what
means can it have been amassed, but able speculation
with the fortunes of others,—by the risk of what is not
his own ? Why do we intrust our property to a banker?
To be taken care of, and rendered back on demand! If
susceptible of being turned to account, the profit should
be ours, or partly ours; otherwise, we incur the hazard
without the benefit. Coutts began life, we are told, with
half-a-crown. How did he obtain his millions ? By
gaining the confidence of rich men, and the credit of a
man possessing the confidence of rich men, till he held in
ous smile.

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
his hands, in deposit, the means of indulging his genius
for financial speculation. It was genius, and it prospered.
But a blunder of Coutts's might have involved hundreds
of families in ruin. Whereas his prosperity enabled him
to prove, by the alliances of his family, that the proudest
in the realm will grovel in the dust at the foot of the
Golden Calf!"
“Most true!" ejaculated Lady Vernon, beginning to
discover eloquence in a man whose principles were so
congenial with her own; as if the principles of a dining-
out-man were not plastic to the prejudices of every house
in which he is accustomed to pick up slices of venison and
crumbs of cake.
“The fact is," resumed Flimflam, perceiving that he
was making an impression, “there are too many counter-
feits in society. Far too much glare, and bustle, and
show, has been introduced into the quiet resorts of the
great world, by these Brummagem pretenders. Like the
cornets à pistons and Turkish cymbals which deteriorate
modern music, these people make too much noise. Were
I to date the decline of taste in England, in matters of
art or literature, it would be from the ascendancy of the
Moneyed Interest. A financial aristocracy, a nobility of
the counter, encourages artists, but extinguishes art.
Mozart has been out of fashion ever since seven bankers'
wives had boxes in the grand-tier; and it is well known
that Lawrence attributed the gimcrackery of his latter
portraits, to the influence of city patronage.”
“No one can deny," retorted Lady Vernon, “ that the
Vandykes and Lelys, whose practice was confined ex-
clusively to the court, produced a very different order of
portrait from the Royal Academicians, compelled to per-
petuate the necklaces and guipure lace of Portland PĪace
and Harley Street."
“Just as the unctuous dishes of the French cuisine,
over-truffled and over-spiced, were invented for the
Fermiers Généraux of the time of Louis XV.,'
" added
Flimflam, "those flimsy, flashy, unwholesome tissues of
false sentiment and flippancy, called fashionable novels,
have been composed for the delight of the bankers'
wives. The favourite works on the boudoir-table of

the Hamlyn tribe are those gaudy fool-traps, the
Annuals."
“ Too true!” replied Lady Vernon, beginning to
wonder why she had ever conceived such a dislike to
little Mr. Flimflam. * But, after all, these bankers are
interested in promoting a taste for every idle and useless
expense that increases the value of
money."
A most luminous idea, ,-a very logical deduction,”
said Flimflam gravely. Many a political economist
might envy the origination of such a theory, and Mon-
tesquieu has gained credit by axioms less profound.
But are we not sometimes over-apt to impute designs to
our neighbours ? The policy of Russia, for instance.
Which of us has not heard, as long as he can remember,
of the designs of Russia ? Whereas, as Lord Crawley
observed to me when I was dining with him t'other day,
(and Lord Crawley may be esteemed something of an
authority on such points!) if Russia had any marvellous
designs, would she be fool enough to let us find her
out?”
“What is that, my dear Flimflam ?” inquired a dis-
tinguished Opposition member seated near them, whose
ear was caught by such starting names as those of an
Empire and a Home Secretary.
“I was telling Lady Vernon,” said Flimflam,
chanted to extend the circle of his auditors,—“ that the
other day Lord Crawley was pointing out the absurdity
of attributing profound or crooked policy to the Russians,
the most arbitrary of European Cabinets; a cabinet
which belabours one au moral as it crushed Napoleon au
physique, by the frozen hammer of Thor rather than the
polished steel of Machiavel !"
“Rather a bold assertion for Crawley!” observed the
gentleman he was addressing, with an air of polite incre-
dulity.
"I can, however, attest its authenticity, for he said it
to myself!” replied Flimflam; thereby entitling the
persons present to attribute in all companies to the
Home Secretary a speech and sentiment in which his
real share was in the proportion of "one pennyworth of
bread to a monstrous quantity of sack.”

THE BANKER'S WIFE;
But, saving for such amplifications, and such rumours

profitable occupation of the Pique Assiette, or diner-out;
à moral gargotier, who lives by hashing up with spices
and condiments for the small-talk of his Saturday's
dinner, the savoury morsels he has carried away from the
colloquial feasts of the preceding week.
The painstaking Flimflam had a ready return for his
base coin.
In the course of the evening, Lady Vernon
requested him to do her the favour of calling upon her
in Grosvenor Place; and before four-and-twenty hours
were over his head, had amused the dinner-table of a fox-
hunting country baronet with an account of the absurdity
of a certain exclusive Lady Vernon, who assured him,
him, Erasmus Flimflam,--that she had been forced to
desert her box at the Opera, and ascend a tier higher, in
consequence of the glare of the bullion and spangles
displayed in the turbans and trimmings of the bankers'
wives !
The following Sunday, the “familiar toad” assumed
his place for the first time at the table of Lord Vernon;
furnished with some capital anecdotes of Sheridan,
Curran, and Horne Tooke, revised and adapted for the
atmosphere of the house: and the sowing of the dragon's
teeth by Cadmus was not more fertile in the produc-
tion of strife and warfare, than the tale-bearing and tittle-
tattle of the habitual diner-out, exercised, from that day
forward, at his new resort in Grosvenor Place.

the epoch of first love, the brightest of woman's life, was
darkened by the persecutions wantonly inflicted by the
banker, the faithful devotion of Robert Hamilton had
afforded a haven in the storm.
She was consequently justified in the faith, which most
women, whether justifiedly or not, profess in their heart
of hearts, that love is the surest of human consolations ;
and when trouble came again, and she found herself
alone in the world, -alone and exposed to the molesta-
tions sure to beset a woman so singularly beautiful,-it
was natural she should accept with gratitude the homage
of an attachment like Henry Hamlyn's.
But her future career was not to be as they had
planned it together in that happy land, where love is
prematurely ripened by the influence of language, climate,
habits, manners. They had agreed to enjoy together a
life of modest competence and mutual devotion. Instead
of which, they were fated to meet no more; and Ellen, so
far from becoming an obscure, laborious, adored and
adoring wife, found herself suddenly elevated to the
enjoyment of every luxury, and the gratification of every
vanity.
While the fashionable world was, as usual, taking fire
under the blaze of a new beauty, and welcomed at Ormeau
and Rotherwood with the utmost deference and adulation,
her heart remained sad and lonely. The passion of a fop
like Alberic Vernon was only a source of disgust:-the
affection of an amiable man like Lord Edward Sutton, a
matter of regret. For her whole soul was still con-
centered in that silent chamber of the solitary student,
who, if he had withdrawn the pledge of their trothplight,
was not the less dear.
To whatever place of public amusement Ellen was
forced by the mistaken kindness of the Colonel, her
thoughts were constantly wandering to the past; or dis-
tracted by surmises concerning the health and happiness
of him whom, for a time, she had regarded as her future
husband; and from the moment tidings reached ber of
his indisposition, she had scarcely absented herself an
hour from the company of Mrs. Hamlyn.
Between these two women, united by a common

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
object of affection, not a syllable of explanation had been
exchanged. Situated as they mutually were, it was im.
possible for one to say to the other, “ dear indeed would
you have been to me as the wife of my son!”—or for the
other to whisper" fain would I have been to you as
the most dutiful of daughters.” But without a word
spoken, they understood each other,-appreciated each
other, -loved each other. When Ellen entered the
drawing-room in Cavendish Square, Mrs. Hamlyn took
occasion to inform some other person present that she
had heard from Henry,--that Henry was better ;-and
if Mrs. Hamlyn appeared too much out of spirits to
attend some ball or party, Ellen would persuade Lydia
to content herself with the chaperonage of Lady Rother-
wood, or pretend a headache as an excuse for remaining
at home.
Over their quiet work and tea-table, they never men-
tioned the name of Henry. Yet not a syllable uttered
between them but bore reference to him or his projects.
It seemed as if, conscious of the distance which Lydia's
happy marriage must create between her and her parents,
Mrs. Hamlyn were securing to herself future consolation
in the affections of a new daughter.
Colonel Hamilton saw all this, and with the utmost
satisfaction. The banker's wife was his model of
womanly excellence; and he rejoiced that the Ellen in
whom he was desirous of investing his stock of human
affections, should modify the somewhat lofty tone of her
character under the influence of Mrs. Hamlyn. The
energetic disposition of his daughter-in-law might in
return inspire her friend with courage for her separation
from the young. Marchioness; and if the good man
indulged in ulterior projects concerning the mother and
daughter, he kept the secret strictly to himself.
“ At present, not a word—at present, mum! Ellen
deserves some punishment for her slyness," was the
result of his frequent self-communing." "She ought to
have had more confidence in poor old Jack Hamilton.”
Yet, whenever he saw tears about to start from the
fine eyes of his daughter-in-law, he could scarcely forbear
exclaiming, “Don't fret, my dear,—don't fret !--True

love seldom runs smooth. But when two young folks
are agreed, and money is not wanting, matters come
straight at last.”
Sometimes, when Ellen was in better spirits after one
of her long interviews with Mrs. Hamlyn, he found it
equally difficult to refrain from quizzing her concerning
her flushed cheeks and unusual gaiety.
“You look so blooming this morning, Nelly, my child,"
said he, one day, on her return to the hotel after having
officiated as chaperon to Lydia while sitting for her
picture, “that I could almost fancy Master Watty had
been with you at Francis Grant's ?"
“I have not seen Captain Hamlyn these two days,"
replied Mrs. Hamilton, with an air of resentment.
Why, you won't pretend to tell me, my dear,—(for
as tragedy-queenish as you choose to look on the
occasion,) —that you are not aware the handsome
Captain is dying for love of you ?”
"Love ?-Captain Hamlyn scarcely treated me with
civility, till he saw me assume a better place in society
than he had measured out to so insignificant a person.
It was not till I was stamped current by the attention of
Mr. Vernon, that he began to notice me; and it required
the homage of a Lord Edward Sutton to obtain me the
honour of his."
“Well, whether his passion be natural or artificial,
spontaneous or derivative, admit that Walter's the hand-
somest young fellow in Lon'on, let t’other be whom he
may. If he didn't bear the hateful name of Hamlyn,
(against which you seem to have set your obstinate little
mind,) I warrant you'd be acting Lady Bountiful, twenty
years hence, at Dean Park, long a'ter we old fogrums are
dead and forgotten."
The fluctuating colour on the cheek of poor Ellen
betrayed emotions which even the Colonel would have
scrupled to call forth.
“But we're going to have a worse specimen of the
family on our hands shortly!” added he, intently watching
her. “The lad who's been sapping all this time at
Cambridge, finding himself likely to make a bad job of
it, chooses to sham ill; and his family have been gulled

into persuading him to ask for holidays.-For my part,
I hate pedants, of every shape, sort, and size; and shan't
find my way half so often to Cavendish Square, now
we're to have the drawing-room fire-side puzzled with
Latin and Greek, and the solemn phiz of a Mr. Gradus
established there like an owl on a perch!- Imagine me,
who find it a hard matter to speak dictionary English,
stuck up opposite a fellow who declines his nouns and
conjugates his verbs, by the book.”
"I was well acquainted with Henry Hamlyn in Italy,"
said Mrs. Hamilton, with an effort that crimsoned her
face as she raised her eyes towards the searching glance
of the Colonel, -"and can assure you, sir, that he is no-
thing of a pedant."
“Oh! he isn't, eh ?—Well, so much the better!-And
pray, is he as good-looking as Walter ?”
“In my opinion, far handsomer, for he has an expres-
sive and intellectual countenance. The good looks of
Captain Hamlyn are the mere result of features and
complexion."
“A capital result, at all events, as that pretty finical
Miss of Lord Vernon's is beginning to find out! Last
night, when Watty was taking so much pains to find you
a seat at the Ancient Concert, Lady Vernon and her
daughter looked as if they wished to mince you into very
small pieces. But tell me, Nelly, how came this chap
with the intellectual countenance to be let off so cheap
in Italy, between two pretty widows like yourself and
Lady Burlington ?”
Lady Burlington has children to occupy her thoughts
and affections; and Henry Hamlyn, who is eight years
younger than herself, besides being a Protestant and son
to a man she abhors, would be scarcely a suitable
husband. With respect to myself”-she paused
“Well, my dear!—With respect to yourself ?”-
“I would rather not answer you,-for it is not in my
power to answer you candidly,”-said she, with firm.
“Thank you, Nelly!—Thank you, my child!—That's
just the straitfor’ard way in which I like to be treated-
-I'd sooner you'd hit me a box of the ear, any day of

ness.

the week, than palaver me with a syllable of gammon.
Well! we shall have the intellectual countenance here
to-day, by dinner-time; and then, look to your secret."
Mrs. Hamilton réplied by silently kissing his hand.
“I shan't see him to-night, however,” said the Colonel
laughing; “ so don't try and coax me to be a good boy,
before I've an opportunity of being a bad one. To-day's
the grand let-off of the Chairman of the East India
Company; and as the dinner's given expressly to me, I
suppose I must go through the evening and my rubber
with the big-wigs asked to meet me; twenty at dinner
most likely, and only a quarter of a liver in the whole
party! By the way, Nelly, (I may as well tell you, for
ten to one those chattering newspapers will, if I don't,)
that the poor old Rajah at Ghazerapore has sent over
funds to the Company, to buy me a service of plate as a
token of gratitude and affection. So, some day or other,
when I'm in a better place, and you and your good man,
whoever he may be, settled in the house in Portland
Place, you'll have a few spoons and sauceboats to help
set you up in housekeeping."
Great was the disappointment to the Colonel to find
the following morning from Ellen, (who absented herself
from Cavendish Square in the expectation of Henry's
arrival,) that a note from Lydia had apprised her of his
non-appearance.
But in return for this unsatisfactory intelligence, the
Colonel had strange news to communicate.
“I didn't expect an over-pleasant dinner yesterday,"
said he. “Those kind of five-course affairs are seldom
agreeable. But, by George! old Launchington's was
worse than I'd bargained for. I suppose the dinners in
Cavendish Square have rather spoiled one."
“Is Sir James Launchington's table, then, so bad a
one?” demanded Ellen, in the simplicity of her heart.
“Oh! 'twasn't that, my dear! Even at a state dinner,
one's always sure of a boiled chicken or slice of roast
mutton. The dinners in this house are no great things;
with their eternal fried whitings and tepid lamb-cutlets;
but you never hear me complain. No, no! what I dis-
liked yesterday, was the company."

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
“I fancied that, in such a house, you were sure of
meeting old colleagues ?”
“I did, my dear, to the tune of a round dozen; which
I was the more sorry for, that one don't like to expose
oneself before old acquaintances.”
Mrs. Hamilton could imagine only one way in which
a gentleman could expose himself at a dinner-party; but
had never seen her father-in-law in the slightest degree
influenced by wine.
“ You see, they weren't exactly all old Indians !” re-
sumed the Colonel. “There were a few city grandees,
and a monkey-man or two invited to put round the jokes,
as in the old jovial days a good fellow used to be asked
to assist in passing round the wine. As ill-luck would
have it, one o' these prating parrots was seated opposite
to me; and took occasion to ask me so many idle quès-
tions, as a pretence for lugging in his jokes, that I sup-
pose I took him up short; for, by way of excuse for
having tried to scrape acquaintance, he alluded to having
dined with me at Hamlyn's, when I ran up with Sir
Robert Maitland, and left you at Ormeau.”
“I remember you dined there with a large party,” ob-
served Ellen, who was pouring out tea.
“Well, my dear! No sooner had this ill-favoured,
officious little monkey cited the names of Hamlyn and
Lord Crawley, than a pompous, pursy old gentleman, a
Sir Benjamin something or other, flared up into such an
attack upon Hamlyn, that I was forced to take up his
cudgels and lay about me in a style that's always out of
place in a sociable party. But my man wasn't inclined
to knock under, even when he saw me in such a deuce of
a passion; and didn't scruple to say that Hamlyn had
sold his city colleagues to government;-that the little
man in black (Flimflam, I think they called him) would
i attest that the ambitious banker was going to be created
Lord Scrip;-and that in return for this empty distinction,
he had withdrawn his parliamentary support from a
question which he was pledged, heart, soul, and honour,
to advocate.-'Let Richard Hamlyn show his face in the
city after the perpetration of the apostacy he is said to
meditate,' said this stuffy old Sir Benjamin, and things

valuable man,
will be thrown in his teeth he may find it difficult to
digest!'"
" But is Mr. Hamlyn about to be created Lord Scrip ???
inquired Mrs. Hamilton, in some surprise.
“If so, he is a greater ass than I take him for!" re-
torted the Colonel.« Hamlyn's, a
in a plain
way. But what the deuce should a fellow who has spent
his life behind his counter in Lombard Street, do in the
House of Peers ?—A Banker-lord would be a joke for
the pantomime. But I'd pawn my life Hamlyn_had
never a notion of the sort; and in answer to Sir Ben-
jamin's accusations, I called on the little chatter-box by
my side to second my defence of the man whose bread
and salt he had eaten."
And Mr. Flimflam of course advocated his cause.”
“On the contrary, he did his best to confirm the whole
story, by declaring that, at the dinner where we met
Lord Crawley, in Cavendish Square, the Home Sec. and
Hamlyn were closeted cheek by jowl in the boudoir, for
more than half an hour, in closest confab; and that the
Minister ended by then saying to the banker, in his hear-
ing, We reckon then on your voice as well as your vote,
my dear Hamlyn; and in return, what you so anxiously
solicit, shall be done without delay.'
"A safe and pleasant guest to receive in one's house !!!
observed Mrs. Hamilton, with disgust.
“Ay, but he'd better have kept his tongue from wag-
ging; for I gave him a piece of mine, which wasn't quite
so satiny as he seemed to wish!”
“ Others then are beginning to entertain, concerning
Mr. Hamlyn, an opinion similar to my own ?” inquired
Ellen, after a moment's reflection.
“ The worst of it is, that I'm afraid there's some truth
in the report. For after dinner, when Launchington
took occasion to say something civil to me in private
about his regret that anything unpleasant should have
occurred to me at his table, he added, he'd rather I should
have heard the ill-news elsewhere, which couldn't long
fail of reaching me. I'm afraid, my dear Colonel,' says
he, ‘Hamlyn's a lost man among us! In the great world,
political intrigues are common. We hear of this. duke

or that lord turning his coat for a riband, or a place.
But among commercial men, a man's word must be as
good as his bond. Unless the columns that support the
mercantile strength of this country are upright and sted-
fast, there's an end of the credit of old England.'
“Mr. Hamlyn had pledged himself, then, to his city
colleagues, to support their interests on this question ? »
“Nay, he held the stakes, as it were, for the rest. The
business comes on to-morrow. I wouldn't be in the
Gallery for a trifle."
“But with the friendly feelings you entertain towards
Mr. Hamlyn," observed Ellen, jealous of the honour of
the family name of him she loved, -—“ surely you may be
yet in time to alter his determination ?-See him, dear
sir, persuade him-_"
“I'm afraid my arguments would have little avail with
a hard-headed man like Hamlyn."
“ If you were at least to try?” pleaded Ellen.
6 Half
the objects in this world are lost for want of a struggle.
We are too fond of concluding evils to be inevitable. I
hare the worst opinion of Mr. Hamlyn. I know him to be
base, calculating, heartless.--I believe he would sacrifice
wife, child, friend, to his sordid speculations. But there
are arguments for all natures and capacities. This
man,
whose ears are deaf to the cry of nature, is open to the
influence of worldly opinion. Tell him how he is thought
of,—tell him how he is spoken of.—Tell him that the
very honours for which he is bartering his good name
will be spat upon and despised by the very fools he is
intent on dazzling. But what makes you smile ?” said
she, perceiving a sudden mistiness in the old man's eyes,
and a singular expression in his countenance.
“I was thinking that I never saw any one look more
like a queen than you
do at this moment!” ejaculated the
Colonel. “Ab, Nelly! Bob knew better than his father,
when he proposed to give me such a daughter. Why,
why did I hurry him into the grave, with such a wife and
such happy destinies awaiting him in this world !”
“You did not, sir,” replied Mrs. Hamilton, in a more
subdued voice. “It was the work of the man you call
your friend. It was the doing of Hamlyn.”-

327
Colonel Hamilton shrugged his shoulders.
“I'm loth to believe the worst of my fellow-creaturis,"
said he. “I think now, as I thought the moment my
poor son's letter and your remonstrances arrived at
Ghazerapore, that Hamlyn acted for the best, and judged
for the worst. But if he justifies the charges made
against him yesterday at Launchington's, he'll be acting
for the worst, and no mistake!-As to arguing with him,
Nelly, I shouldn't have the face to do it. One would as
soon argue with a fellow whose hand one found in one's
pocket. The pickpocket I should knock down; and I'm
a’most afraid I might be tempted to use some ugly word
to Hamlyn, such as would ill become the lips of the
father of those two poor boys, to whom he opened his
house and heart when the deuce another soul they had to
care for 'em, and give 'em a Christmas home!”
“Still,” pleaded Mrs. Hamilton, “the truest act of
friendship towards a man, is to undertake towards him
some painful office, from which others recede.”
She was interrupted by untimely visitors. Miss Cres-
well and her young charge, who often, in their morniny's
walk, brought messages to Mrs. Hamilton, made their
appearance.
For the Colonel, in his cordial love of young
people, was beginning to transfer to Harriet the good
offices he had exercised in favour of her sister; and the
young girl who, amid the hurry and occupation created in
Cavendish Square by the approaching wedding, was some-
what overlooked at home, was never happier than when
sent on an errand to the Hamiltons.
The note of which she was the bearer regarded merely
an arrangement for accompanying Lydia that evening to
Lady Dartford's, who had forwarded her invitation to
Ellen through her daughter-in-law. But the real pur-
port of Harriet's mission was soon apparent to Mrs.
Hamilton, when her young friend suddenly exclaimed-
“Is it not provoking, dear Colonel Hamilton, that,
after all, we are not to have Harry in town ?-Instead of
coming to amuse himself among us, he is gone down to
Dean, where he won't find a soul to speak to at this time
of the year.”
The deuce he is ?" cried the Colonel, stealing a furtive

glance towards Ellen, who was wonderfully busy refold-
ing Mrs. Hamlyn's note into the shape of a dunce's cap.
* Think how dull he will be! Not a creature at Bur-
lington to welcome him but old Carlo! Even Dr. Mark-
ham is too cautious about Mrs. Markham's approaching
confinement, to leave the parsonage. How much hap-
pier my brother would have been here in London !"
“You forget, my dear," interposed Miss Creswell,
“that your brother has serious pursuits which occupy
his time, and dispose him against frivolous diversions.
“ That's the worst of the case, my dear good ma'am!"
cried the Colonel. “ 'Tis because he has been duncing
himself into an atrophy over his serious pursuits,
that we want to get him among us, to be nursed and
petted. Frivolous diversions are bark and steel to him!''
The bow's been bent too tight; and if we don't relax
the strings, they may chance to crack. And then where
are we, pray, with our serious pursuits ? Well! I sup-
pose this nonsense of his will cost me another journey.
I don't know what I should ha' done with sons of my own;
for even these boys of Hamlyn's make a penny-postman
of
poor
old Jack."
Às soon as Harriet and the governess had departed,
Ellen succeeded in persuading the Colonel to leave the
young recluse for a few days to the reaction of his own
heart. Aware of the rash nature of Colonel Hamilton's
well-affectioned impulses, she was apprehensive he might
commit her by cheering the sadness of the invalid at her
expense, with insinuations of an attachment on her part,
which, tacitly rejected as she had been, would be griev-
ous to her self-respect.
But on her own part she had determined to place him
in possession of the rumours which were gathering ground
relative to the honour of his father; and within an hour
after breakfast she had despatched to Euston Square a
letter to be forwarded by the railway, conveying to Henry
Hamlyn the tidings of his father's political dereliction,
and entreating him to start for London, and use his influ-
ence against the consummation of his disgrace.
Much as she personally despised Richard Hamlyn, she
was aware of the high credit attached to his house. Even

329
at Ormeau, even among the Cossingtons, by whom he
was disliked, she had heard him spoken of with the respect
due to public integrity; and fervent were her entreaties
to Henry, if he valued his father's credit and the honour
of his family, to exert himself to the utmost.
“Do not," wrote Mrs. Hamilton, “ attribute this sug-
gestion to any weak desire to see you again. Situated
as we have been, and are, such a meeting could only be
fraught with pain for both. But I cannot control my
desire that the name I once hoped would become my own
should stand unblemished. When a man betrays the
interests of his order for interests of his own, whether
that order be chivalrous or commercial, he becomes
infamous. The loss of the measure about to be ruined
by your father's apostacy will strike a fatal blow, it is
said, to our commercial credit in foreign countries; and
wherever canvassed, -to whatever remote spot the injury
may extend,-his
name, which is yours, will be connected
with the shame. Dearest Henry, prevent this ! Exercise
your strong powers of reasoning to convince him that it
is never too late to recede from an act of baseness.
Reward his harsh dealing towards you by saving him
from an inexpiable error!”
This letter once on its way, she was happier. It ap-
peared strange, however, while passing a portion of the
day with the Hamlyns, to see them so joyous and unsus-
pecting, with a misfortune impending over the family, of
which she and Colonel Hamilton alone seemed cognisant.
In the drawing-room in Cavendish Square, she found, as
usual, Mrs. Hamlyn, Walter, Lydia, and Lord Dartford;
who, after a slight expression of regret at their disap-
pointment about Henry, returned to the discussion of
hammercloths, point-lace, orange flowers, special licenses,
and the lustre and lightness to be secured in the setting
of a diamond coronet. Lydia seemed unconsciously im-
bibing, from the joyous young man to whom she had
pledged her affections, some portion of the levity inse-
parable from his brilliant position; and if Mrs. Hamlyn
occasionally directed towards the happy thoughtless couple
one of the saddened ks which those who have suffered
let fall

the novices in life, for whom all that glitters

TIE BANKER'S WIFE;
is still gold, even her gravity gave way at times to the
contagion of their joy and prosperity.
Lydia looked so happy, so full of bright and kindly
thoughts,-as she sat with her hand enclasped in that of
the bridegroom who had chosen her with such disin-
terested affection, that the mother's love overflowed, and
the sunken rocks of life were for a moment hidden by
the tide.
As Mrs. Hamilton passed the dining-room to return to
her carriage, escorted by Captain Hamlyn, who adored
as the future Lady Edward Sutton the beautiful woman
he had disparaged as Bob Hamilton's widow, she caught
sight through the open door of the richly-laid table, which
Ramsay was preparing for a dinner-party, with all its
luxury of damask, crystal, china, its groaning sideboard,
and glittering dumb-waiters.
“And for these gewgaws,” mused she, “is this man
sullying his conscience ! - These be thy gods, oh Israel! -
To think that thousands of men and women are induced
to degrade themselves by debt, and harass their lives with
remorse, in order that their ostentation
may be graced by
gauds like these!"
That day, she dined with her father-in-law at Lord
Cossington's. During the lifetime of his father, the
income of the Marquis was limited, and the right-think-
ing couple had sufficient regard for their own dignity to
live within it. Their quiet comfortable house in Wilton
Crescent was accordingly unembellished by the brilliant
novelties and showy elegance of the banker's establish-
A few pleasant friends at their board, a good
plain dinner served upon it, and the cheerful conversation
that ensued from such a combination, made the evening
pass more agreeably than was the case in Cavendish
Square; where the mind of the host was always secretly
intent on the spectacle of his entertainment, and the
mind of the hostess on the fluctuations in that of the
host.
The only drawback on Ellen's pleasure in the little
circle in Wilton Crescent, into which she was welcomed
as a friend, was the certainty that her presence had
driven Lord Edward from his brother's fireside; in the

331
dread of compromising his happiness by further intimacy
with one who had explicitly informed him her affections
were pre-engaged. She was almost sorry when the
carriage arrived to convey her to Lady Dartford's for
the remainder of the evening. The high spirits of the
excited Marquis, and the bustle of the house of feasting,
accorded less with her present depression, than the sober
habits of the Cossingtons.
The following day, at an early hour for the routine of
morning visits, Henry Hamlyn was announced in the
drawing-room in St. James's Street; and but that the
Duchess of Elvaston, in pursuance of her old-fashioned
habits, was already sitting with her, Ellen would have
scarcely found it possible to refrain from an exclamation
of horror at the change wrought by the last three months
in the person of her lover. They had parted on the day
of the meeting of parliament, when Henry hurried up
from Cambridge to meet her at the Tower Stairs, and
conduct her to her hotel ;-parted, full of hope, happi-
ness, and health ;—and now, something in the haggard
countenance of her guest, brought so powerfully to mind
the wasted looks of poor Robert Hamilton in his last
illness, that Ellen was forced to press her hands strin-
gently on her heart and pause for breath, ere she could
resume with the Duchess the conversation his arrival
had interrupted. Nor was the coherency of Henry im-
proved by gathering from their conversation the name of
the noble matron so maternal in her deportment to
Ellen. Common report having apprised him
passion of Lord Edward Sutton, he fancied he discerned
à tone of motherly affection in her Grace's address to
Mrs. Hamilton.
Meanwhile the Colonel, to whom the arrival of the
new visitor had been duly announced, bustled in with a
thousand cordial welcomes for one with whom, notwith-
standing his intimacy with the other branches of the
family, circumstances had prevented his becoming ac-
quainted; and, though he had seen Henry only a few
minutes the preceding year, in a morning visit in
Cavendish Square, he received him more as a son than a
stranger. It was impossible for a man of his jocose dis-

position not to steal one little look at Ellen, to see how
she bore his unexpected arrival; and a sad disappoint-
ment it proved, when, instead of the conscious smiles
and “ blushes celestial rosy red” he had anticipated, he
found the face of his daughter-in-law just then resemble
a statue of Niobe, rather than a living woman.
In order to afford an opportunity for the young couple
to recover themselves and exchange a few happy words
of tenderness, Colonel Hamilton was suddenly seized
with a fit of gallantry towards the Duchess of Elvaston ;
insisting upon showing her some volumes of Italian
engravings brought over by Ellen, which he had only
been able to extricate from the Custom House a few
days before.
This had the desired effect. While the Duchess
accepted his proposal to examine them more at her ease
on a large table near the window, Henry Hamlyn, in an
abrupt and agitated manner, approached Mrs. Hamilton.
A few whispered sentences sufficed to convey a world of
painful intelligence.
" Thank you heartily for your warning!” said he,
without preamble. “I appreciate all that is noble and
forgiving in your effort on the occasion. But my inter-
ference has been wholly fruitless. I have seen him. I
have remonstrated-pleaded-argued-with the utmost
respect, but the utmost warmth. All, all in vain !--He
is determined to lose himself ;-he, whose independence
of mind, I venerated as that of a demi-god. ` I could
have borne all but this, Ellen! The ruin of my earthly
happiness was nothing to this. I have suffered much.
My health is failing.-My faculties are broken.—And
-But I am too selfish in vexing you with my
afflictions !"-said he, stopping short, when he beheld
tears stealing down the marble cheeks of Mrs. Hamilton.-
“I would not, however, leave London, dearest Ellen,
without thanking and blessing you!"
Going so soon ?” — faltered Mrs. Hamilton, unpre-
pared for this announcement.
“What would you have me do ?-I cannot trust
myself, dearest, to stay here! I have not courage to
hear my father's name become the scorn of his old

just now, I met -But no matter! It is not for
you
to
take part in my humiliations.-Farewell !"
It was impossible for Mrs. Hamilton to withhold her
hand; nor indeed had she voice or self-possession at
that moment to hazard an attempt at detaining him.
Colonel Hamilton and the Duchess, however, who were
turning over the rustling leaves of Piranesi, saw nothing
that was going on; and when, roused to attention by
the bell rung by Mrs. Hamilton, the Colonel turned
suddenly round to shake the hand extended to him by
Henry, he was deterred from one of his habitual explosions
of jocularity, by the anguish betrayed in the countenance
of his young visitor.
“Where are you going, Harry ?” said he. “Have you
a horse here, or a cab ?”
“I am going to Knightsbridge, I am going to see
my brother!” was the faltered reply; and Colonel
Hamilton saw that the
poor
fellow had so much difficulty
in giving utterance to even those hurried words, that to
conceal his emotion from the spectacled Duchess, he
resumed his task of turning over the leaves as fussily as
though the world contained no object of greater interest
than the ruins of the Capitol.
"A younger son, I presume, of Mr. Hamlyn of Dean
Park Pi' said her Grace, after his exit. “Those young
people bear a very high character. Lady Dartford, that
is to be, is very much thought of by the members of her
new family; and my son Richaril, who is in the Life-
Guards, tells me the eldest son is one of the smartest
officers in the Blues.—This seems a very gentlemanly
young man, a little resembling his mother,—whom I
remember a most pleasing, pretty woman. In his father's
business, I conclude ?"
" At present, only a young Cantab, and like to be the
senior wrangler of his year,” replied the Colonel, proudly.
"Some day or other, he will probably be in the bank
and in parliament; and then, I venture to predict that
your Grace will hear news of him !"
Sir Henry Middlebury himself would scarcely have
proved a more advantageous interlocutor at that moment

than did the good old humdrum Duchess; who, at the
word parliament,-(so stirring a watchward in the ears
of all the Suttons !)—found as many questions to ask as
would have filled three pages of Pinnock or Mangnall,
concerning the prospects of the callow senator,--his
principles, -his views,--his education, -his private tutor,
-his public,-nay, even his preparatory school.
While poor Ellen was gradually recovering her self-
possession for the parting compliments required of her,
Colonel Hamilton persevered in his negatives and affirma-
tives; varied only by an occasional “I rather think so"
We shall see!”—and a glance over his shoulder
towards the fire-place; where Ellen, with her face turned
towards the looking-glass, was smoothing her hair, as a
pretext for wiping from her cheeks the tears which not
even her energetic fortitude had been able wholly to
repress.

CHAPTER XXII.
“I would share his joys:
But make his griefs my own."-SOUTHEY.
DEEPLY afflicted by the altered appearance of poor
Henry, Mrs. Hamilton was unable to resume her routine
of daily occupations. The Colonel had luckily an ap-
pointment at the barracks in the Regent's Park with
Lord Richard Sutton; who, at dinner at the Cossingtons',
the preceding day, had insisted upon introducing the
old soldier to the riding-school, his chargers and Irish
blood-hound; and she was consequently at leisure to
hasten to Cavendish Square, and offer all the comfort in
her power to the poor mother, whose anxiety, she con.
ceived, must equal her own.
But, to her surprise and vexation, Mrs. Hamlyn was
absent. The approaching marriage of her daughter
afforded her a thousand peremptory occupations; and
Ellen contrived to discover, by cross-questioning Harriet
and Miss Creswell, that Henry had not seen his mother

since his return from the city; that they knew nothing
of his movements; and that the whole party were going
in the evening to a concert at the house of Lady Vernon.
Nothing could have afforded stronger evidence of the
ignorance of Mrs. Hamlyn concerning the position of
her husband. She was a woman who at all times occu-
pied herself little with the interests of public life; and
the coldness between herself and Richard Hamlyn pre-
vented those natural confidences which must have ren.
dered the crisis as trying to her as to himself.
Nor was she likely to be enlightened concerning the
impending mischief," by the rumours of society. The
apostacy of Hamlyn from the cause of his City col-
leagues, was unsuspected except in a circle of parlia-
mentary men, among whom it had been bruited by the
connivance of ministers expressly in the hope of shaking
the opposition of others; who, on questions of com-
mercial interest, were apt to be influenced by the
opinions of the member for Barthorpe. It was by these
means the report had reached the ears of Sir Benjamin
Bondwell; and, through him, struck consternation to
the heart of Colonel Hamilton. But the majority of
the House, aware that the question was to be brought
before them that night, fully expected to see Richard
Hamlyn get up as usual, to support with his customary
vigour of oratory and extent of information, the line of
policy he had so long and conscientiously upheld.
That the discovery of his sudden secession, in con-
nexion with the report of his approaching ennoblement,
would array against him a host of exulting enemies,
Mrs. Hamilton could not doubt; and sincerely did she
regret to find that Lydia and her mother were likely to
be startled by intelligence of such a nature, under the
roof of persons whom she knew to be their foes. It was
more than probable, if the division took place at an early
hour, that many members would arrive in Grosvenor
Place, open-mouthed from the House, with tidings of the
recreancy of Hamlyn the banker!
Address a letter to Mrs. Hamlyn on the subject, she
dared not. It is so difficult to allude, in words calculated
to meet the eye of a wife, to any dereliction from honour

man."
on the part of a husband! Moreover, there was so great
a probability that any letter brought by one of Colonel
Hamilton's servants might fall into the hands of the
banker, that it seemed impossible to hazard a hint upon
the subject nearest her heart.
“ After all, women are not responsible for the political
delinquencies of their husbands," said she; "and the
society of the Vernons is composed of people too well-
bred to afford any indication to dear Mrs. Hamlyn of the
contempt provoked by the paltering of this despicable
She had agreed to accompany Lady Cossington, that
'night, to the Duchess of Elvaston's box at Covent Garden;
and in the fear of provoking the remarks of the Colonel
if she excused herself, judged it better to enjoy her ab-
straction in pretended attention to the play, than remain
at home, cultivating her uneasiness and exciting that of
her father-in-law.
Poor Ellen had, however, for once, nothing to fear
from the Colonel's jocoseness. So deeply was he affected
by a circumstance likely to discredit the man in whom
he had placed such implicit confidence, and afflict the
family he loved best in the world, that so far from in-
dulging in pleasantries, or enjoying a good play seen
from a good box, he remained as still and silent as Ellen
herself, till the entrance of Lord Cossington towards the
end of the afterpiece.
"I thought there was a division to-night?” said his
wife, whom he had forewarned not to expect him.
“ There is! But, to my great surprise, I am not
wanted, and have paired off. We have it hollow to-night.
Thanks to a forcible speech from Hamlyn the banker,
ministers will carry the question.”
And forthwith they began discussing the performance.
For there was nothing to surprise Lady Cossington in
her husband's announcement. Hamlyn was on many
occasions an able supporter of Government; and Colonel
Hamilton knew better than to provoke explanations by
a single inquiry. Ellen consequently remained secure
from the cutting remarks she had apprehended. She
was among people for whom the moneyed interests of the

337
any
country constitute no especial interest, and for whom a
ministerial triumph is all in all.
Next morning, the Hamiltons woke with that vague
sense of disquietude which arises from the backslidings of
a friend. Neither of them chose to refer, as they sat at
breakfast, to the subject which occupied the thoughts of
both; and as the newspaper lying on the table was the
leading ministerial journal, it adverted to the debate of
the night before, as chiefly remarkable for the powerful
speech of the Honourable Member for Barthorpe; com-
plimenting the ministry and the country on his recently
enlightened views, and remarking that it was not possible
for a man of such strong understanding and consistent
principles, to remain permanently opposed to a measure
indispensable to the tranquillization of the public mind.
It was useless to refer to such an organ,
for indica-
tion of the state of the public opinion towards Hamlyn.
“I don't much like going to Cavendish Square to-day,"
said the Colonel, as they rose from the breakfast-table.
“Did I understand you right, my dear Nelly, that Harry
was going out of town again ?-Don't he mean to dine
with me? Don't he mean to-
“ I know no more than yourself!" replied Mrs. Hamil-
ton, in a low voice. “He appeared yesterday to be in a
state bordering on distraction. All that we regret in his
father's proceedings, is to him a source of despair.”
“Poor fellow, poor fellow!" interrupted the Colonel, in
his turn. “A noble heart, I take it, - a high-toned mind,
-too good by half for a banker. Nelly! we must say or
do something to comfort him.-Sit down, my dear, and
write him a bit of a note.Persuade him to dine with us
to-day.”
Alas! any demonstration of kindness, on my part
would only aggravate the evil!” replied Mrs. Hamilton,
deeply touched by the affectionate tone of the old man.
“Better leave him to himself. I own, however, I am most
anxious for news of his movements. If, therefore, you dis-
like going to Cavendish Square, could you not call upon his
brother at Knightsbridge, or upon Lord Dartford, or "
“ Can I speak with you a minute, sir ?” interrupted the si
voice of Johnston, who, just then, half-opened the door,

THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
“Come in, come in !—No one here but Mrs. Hamilton
-Come in, Johnston!” cried the Colonel, almost angry at
ahesitation which he attributed to the punctilio established
as a matter of etiquette by the waiters of the hotel. Still,
however, the man hung back; even after his master had
pettishly inquired what the deuce he was afraid of.
“I wished, Colonel, to have a moment's private talk
with you,” said he, forced at length to enter the room ;
and Mrs. Hamilton was astonished to perceive that the
face of the gray-headed servant was almost as ghastly as
that of Henry Hamlyn the preceding day. In a moment,
it occurred to her that some mischance had befallen the
object of her affections !
“ Johnston!” said she, assuming a tone of firmness
sorely belied by the tremor of her frame, -"pray speak
out. Do not be afraid of alarming me.
I see how it is!
You have bad news to communicate from Cavendish
Square !"
"I have, indeed, ma'am," said he, almost sobbing.
“Sad news, -sad news,—though I'm sure I don't know
how the report should have reached you already; for the
man who brought the account ran all the way, and is now
breathless in the hall.”
"What the deuce are you all talking about ?" cried
the Colonel, becoming alarmed, yet angry with them and
himself for his own agitation.—“ What news ?— What
man ?- What's happened ?-Speak out!”—
“He is not dead, sir, as was at first apprehended!" re-
plied Johnston, little suspecting the anguish which his
inexplicitness was inflicting on his young lady. “The
surgeon who was with him in the coach had done no more
than stanch the blood; so he could not by any means say
the case was hopeless.”
“Of whom are you talking ?” persisted Colonel Hamil-
ton, sickened by an agony of suspense; while Ellen fixed
her eyes inquiringly on Johnston, incapable of pronouncing
a syllable.
“Of Mr. Hamlyn, sir, who has been desperately
wounded in a duel. Mrs. Hamlyn, as soon as she could
be made to understand what had happened, desired you
might be sent for."

had
“Why the deuce didn't you say so at first ? Let the
carriage come round, or stay,,no!-call a cab!—I don't
know what I'm thinking of, or saying.—My hat, John-
ston !- Ellen, my poor child, — I see by the expression of
your countenance for how dreadful a blow
you pre-
pared yourself. But 'tis bad enough as 'tis.- Poor
Hamlyn,-the father of such a family! Coming with
me ?_That's well !--I should have scarce found courage
for the scene, Nelly, unless you were by my side.”
The information gradually, slowly, and sadly acquired
by Colonel Hamilton in explanation of this afflicting
summons, may as well be succinctly related to the reader.
The Morning Chronicle, while announcing in so kindly a
spirit the political conversion of Mr. Hamlyn, had con-
siderately forborne to notice the grievous interruptions,
hootings, howlings, bellowings, and crowings, experi-
enced by the member for Barthorpe, in the course of a
speech, which, had it been the result of conviction and
good faith, was citable as a fine effort of oratory. From
the moment of driving his "filthy bargain," or rather of
being driven into it, Hamlyn had been intent on the
concoction of this web of sophistry. Confiding, and with
reason, in his powers of dissimulation, he trusted to give
to his act of treachery an air of conviction, recantation,
and atonement.
Great, therefore, was his disappointment when, for the
first time in his political career, he experienced the
greatest difficulty in making himself heard. He had of
course taken precautions that the smallest syllable of his
discourse (which might have been aptly named “Hamlyn's
Apology”) should reach the ears, or rather the pens of
the reporters, to ensure having justice done him on the
morrow by the ministerial organs. Still, it was humi-
liating indeed to one accustomed to be listened to on
financial questions, amid a silence which enabled him to
hear a pin drop, to be assailed with outcries of so inde-
cent a description as now met his ear. It was in fact a
charivari, effected by assailants of the highest class and
credit.
He bore the attack in a manner very different from
what might have been expected. The baited bull neither

tore up the ground under his feet, nor turned upon
the
foes who were hounding him into madness. Either his
habitual hypocrisy enabled him to control all show of
emotion; or he was overwhelmed by consciousness of
his degrading predicament. Even the tone of his speech
had betrayed his depression. His voice was as passion-
less as habitually his countenance; and with many, his
argumentative and self-sacrificing eloquence borrowed
new force from this stern immobility ; resembling that
of an antique statue rather than the irritable energumen
of modern parliaments.
But his enemies thought otherwise. His enemies de-
cided that Samson was shorn of his strength, -thatt
Hamlyn's sun was set.
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
And he retires !"
was the exposition of the honourable member for Alver-
stoke, who was selected by the opposition to badger the
apostate.
A merciless apostrophe from Sir Benjamain Bondwell,
was still harder to be borne. The party-advocate had
attacked a government measure, supported by the hon-
ourable member for Barthorpe. The banker attacked his
brother banker ;-openly, strongly, advisedly; describing
the city as betrayed by one of its most favoured sons,
and ending with “I am very grieved for thee, Jonathan,
my
brother."
All this was passively endured by Richard Hamlyn.
Having screwed his courage to the sticking-place, he
maintained his usual attitude; conversing freely with one
or two Government men, to whom Lord Crawley had
given their cue. Already, the flattering unction of ad-
ministrative thanks had been laid to his soul. For what-
ever feelings his speech might have excited against him
in the commercial world, it had carried the measure; and
a Ministry cares about as much for the sufferings of its
implements, as a General for the life of the soldier who
leads a forlorn hope ! -
At length, encouraged by his tameness, one of the
privileged wits of the Opposition benches, after a humor:

ous comparison of the Honourable Member for Barthorpe
to the thief who bit off his mother's ear at the foot of the
gallows, hazarded so pointed an allusion to the rumoured
elevation of Mr. Hamlyn to the peerage, in reward for
the sudden falling of the scales from his eyes at the touch
of the first lord of the Treasury, that a general cry of
“ Order!” and “Shame!” deadened the force of Ham-
lyn's spirited refutation.
Fortunately for him, they had hit the in-vulnerable
heel; and he was consequently able to defend himself
in a style of indignation, which brought down the cheers
of the House,-always generously susceptible to an in-
justice.
But the cheers of the House expire in the lobby!
There, the member becomes the man again; and when,
after a triumphant division, Richard Hamlyn hurried
through the throng, he found himself contemplated by
many with coldness, by some with undisguised contempt;
while the stammered and awkward compliments of such
of his parliamentary colleagues as had no personal
in the question, evinced more plainly than all the rest
that what might be considered a triumph, had better
have been a failure.
His patience was now oozing from his soul and body,
drop by drop. As the excitement of a man under the
influence of wine is stimulated by contact with the open
air, in proportion as Hamlyn re-approached the common
routine of life, leaving behind him the factitious atmo-
sphere of parliament, where insult is not insult, or deri-
sion, mockery, he became infuriated by the sense of his
mortifications; as a man grows suddenly conscious of his
bruises some time after a fall.
After being wounded to the quick by a civilly ceremo-
nious bow from an old friend with whom he was accus-
tomed to exchange familiar nods, Alberic Vernon passed
him, laughing immoderately; arm and arm with the
wicked wit by whom the question of the Scrip Peerage
had been so unworthily broached. That he was the subject
of their merriment, he could entertain no doubt; nor did
he hesitate to damp the insolent mirth indulged at his
expense, by instantly accosting them, and demanding

report of his ennoblement.
Alberic Vernon, to whom the officious Squire of Dean
Park had been rendered an object of contempt by the
scorn of his parents, and who now loathed him as the
father of the man reported to be betrothed to the beauti-
ful woman by whom he had been rejected, was far from
regretting this occasion for a public retort.
“He heard it from me, sir!” said he, fiercely.
fact was stated at my father's table, by one of your inti-
mate friends, whose name you will excuse me from men-
tioning, as I am happy to say that it is not the custom of
the Vernon family to betray their associates."
Hamlyn was furious. The two insolent boys before
him were inflamed with all the valour of Bellamy's fiery
sherry; while he was influenced by the still stronger
stimulus of cold and deadly enmity against his kind,
the friends who had abandoned him, the foes who had
clamoured over his fall;— and when the companion of
Alberic Vernon, vexed at finding his weapon of offence
snatched from his hand, persisted in his raillery, such
words were instantly exchanged between them as ren-
dered indispensable explanations of a more deadly kind.
It was past midnight. The dispute had occurred in so
public a place, that there could be little doubt of such
interference between the parties as uniformly protects
the blustering of modern senators; who, like heralds of
old, and Macbeth in modern times, bear a charmed
life.
“We must forestal the police,” was the first remark
of Alberic Vernon, who was to officiate as “friend” to
the aggressor; and Colonel Frampton (an honourable
gentleman whom Hamlyn had sought in haste in the
coffee-room, as at once an obsequious ally of govern-
ment and too heavily indebted to his firm to refuse
assistance) instantly repaired with Vernon to the Tra-
vellers’, to arrange the preliminaries for a meeting, at
daybreak the following morning, in Battersea Fields.
When Hamlyn reached home, the excitement produced
by this disastrous succession of events was still whirring
in his brain and gnawing his heart's core. Fortunately,

343
?
the family was at rest. Mrs. Hamlyn had retired to
her pillow, after having, in obedience to his orders, ap-
peared at Lady Vernon's concert;-to be harassed by
the interrogations of Sir Henry Middlebury, who, know-
ing few people in the room, had attached himself to her
side, not only to offer his congratulations and inquire
the names of all the performers and the various schools
of art in which they had received their musical education,
but the counties in which the Marquis of Dartford's
estates were situated, and the connexions of his family.
Dismissing, therefore, the footman who usually sat up
for him, with instructions that Ramsay should bring him
his shaving-water at a quarter to seven in the morning,
Hamlyn was the only person waking in the house;
alone, with the tremendous consciousness that it was
perhaps the last night he might ever pass under its roof!
-Not that his soul was easily depressed by presenti-
ments. His irritation not having subsided, the prepon-
derating feeling in his heart was to pursue,-retaliate,
-exterminate. Like Lear, he wanted to “kill, kill,
kill!”
The banker had forgotten that He who assumes to
himself the prerogative of Vengeance, might exterminate
in His turn!—The leading characteristic of Hamlyn's
mind was at all times self-reliance. Like most people
who put not their trust in Providence,—like most people
reliant on the intervention of Chance,-it cost him little
more to expect miracles from its operation, than trifles.
Half of the errors of his life arose from this sanguine
confidence. All he had misappropriated of the property
of his clients, he firmly expected to replace. Some
happy combination of luck would enable him to repair
the disorder he had created. And now, with a duel on
his hands,--a duel with a young and adroit antagonist, -
a duel in which public feeling, if not the cause of justice,
would be wholly on the adverse side, --he expected to
despatch his business in Battersea Fields as coolly,
methodically, and triumphantly, as his business on the
Stock Exchange!
His utmost efforts, therefore, towards "setting his
house in order" consisted in addressing a few lines to

344
THE BANKER'S WITE;
Spilsby; with instructions on certain points of business
to be despatched on the morrow, in case he was unable
to reach Lombard Street at an early hour; which he
determined to forward into the city by the same con-
veyance that took him to the residence of his second,
Colonel Frampton, who had promised to drive him to
the ground.
He next committed to the flames a few
papers
from
his bureau, which were not calculated for the scrutiny of
his family, in case he should have to resign his keys to
the custody of his wife. Against more than this, the
bloodless nature of most duels arising out of parlia-
mentary squabbles, seemed to insure him. On recalling
to mind the various hostile meetings which had occurred
for the last twenty years, under similar provocation, he
could not remember one in which the interference of
seconds had not been of the most exemplary nature.
Nevertheless, as his excitement subsided, his thirst for
vengeance grew slack and his spirits became somewhat
depressed. Ere he retired to the small bedroom which,
for some years past, he had occupied, on the plea of the
disturbance his early hours created to Mrs. Hamlyn, he
entered the drawing-room, now cold, silent, deserted,
and imperfectly lighted by the single wax-taper he
carried in his hand. The air was fragrant with the fine
exotics adorning the flower-stands; and the light he
held, dim as it was, fell upon a thousand gorgeous
objects; jasper vases, marble tables, entablatures of mala-
chite and coral, and all the luxury of pietra dura and
marquéterie.
He seemed to notice, for the first time, the softness of
tne rich Aubusson carpet under his feet; the glitter of
the splendid lustre over his head. Like Cardinal
Mazarin, when discovered by his secretary early one
morning a few weeks previous to his decease, taking a
solitary leave of the beloved pictures and exquisite
statues of his gallery, the eyes of the banker lingered
tenderly on the gaudy objects, for the enjoyment and
display of which he had perilled the credit of an honest
name, and the peace and welfare of hundreds of confiding
victims.

At length, just as he was on the point of receding with
noiseless steps from the room over which slept his gentle
wife and the daughter whose dreams were at that
. moment imbued with the brightest hues of happy love,
the light in his hand fell upon the gaudy frame of a large
picture, to which, for some years past, his eyes had never
once been directed; and, for some minutes, they were
riveted
upon it, as by a spell.
It was a portrait,-a full-length portrait from the
pencil of Lawrence; representing Mrs. Hamlyn-no!
not Mrs. Hamlyn-Sophia, at the climax of her youthful
loveliness, a year after her marriage, with her first-born
resting on her knee. The picture had been begun at his
father's suggestion, while the young bride was yet an
idol at Dean Park; the child being added during the
slow completion of the portrait, as an after-thought of
his own.
One of the loveliest infants ever seen, little
Walter derived new beauties from the graceful pencil of
the artist; and well did Hamlyn remember how fondly
he had assisted in keeping the child quiet during the
tedious task of sitting, by holding before his little
laughing eyes the very toy which, in the picture before
him, figured in the hand of the smiling, exulting mother.
-The force of association brought back with life-like
force to the banker's mind the soft, warm grasp of those
dimpled baby hands. At that moment, his own were
cold as death, and hard with the clench of suppressed
emotion!
From the soft and sinuous outline of the half-naked
babe, the eyes of Hamlyn wandered to the face of the
mother. But could those clustering curls,-those spark-
ling eyes,—those blooming cheeks, ever have been the
features of his wife ?—Where was that woman gone ?-
What had become of her ?_She could not have lapsed
into the pale, sad, silent, spiritless being who sat by his
household-board. --She could not have progressed into
the suffering mother who bore her cross so meekly.
For a moment, Sophia Harrington, as he had first beheld
her, joyous, brilliant, beautiful, beloved, recurred to his
mind; and in reflecting on the transformation his conduct
had effected, so heavy a sigh arose from the depths of his

frame, that he had ample need to recur anew for consola-
tion to the face of that beloved son, whose mature years
fulfilled all the promise of their youthful grace. The
passionate joy with which he had hailed the birth of his
first-born, seemed to have prolonged its influence even
until now, with a rapture unsusceptible of decay.
“I should like to have shaken hands again with
Walter!” was his closing reflection, as he quitted the
room and slowly ascended the stairs.
- In these cases,
one never knows what may happen. I should like to
have shaken hands first with Walter."
Next morning, it excited no surprise among the
servants that their ever-active master should be astir an
hour earlier than usual. For a moment, indeed, it struck
Ramsay as extraordinary that Mr. Hamlyn should say
he did not choose to wait for his gig, (which he pretended
to have forgotten to order over-night ;) but that, being
in a hurry, he would walk to the nearest coach-stand.
Nay, even had the butler surmised that his master was
going out to fight a duel, so convinced was he of the pro-
priety and decorum of every measure of Mr. Hamlyn,
that he would have felt persuaded some new canon of the
law had, unknown to himself, authorized and legalized
such a breach of the peace.
Before noon, however, he was suddenly summoned to
assist in removing the wounded man to his chamber;
and the first to propose sending for Colonel Hamilton, as
well as the sons of his unfortunate master.
Such was the state of affairs when the veteran reached
Cavendish Square. The surgeon who had accompanied
Hamlyn home in the carriage from Battersea, had never
left his side; and Cooper and Brodie were every moment
expected. But neither Mrs. Hamlyn nor his daughter
had been permitted to see him. From the bewildered
looks of the former, Colonel Hamilton saw, at
once,
that
she at least entertained no hope ; and, having entreated
Ellen to remain with her friend in the drawing-room, to
which they were sentenced during the examination of the
wound, he hurried with anxious but faltering steps to the

a
who was lying on the bed, half undressed, his coat being
off, and his shirt stained with blood, was roused by the
sound; and, without unclosing his eyes, made the same
inquiry which had already three times before escaped his
lips~" Is that Walter ?»s*
“Captain Hamlyn was out on a field-day, sir, when
John reached the barracks,” whispered Ramsay, who,
with his face as pale as death, was supporting his
master.
While he was yet speaking, Colonel Hamilton ap-
proached the bedside, and gently pressed the hand of the
wounded man. Conscious that this tender touch was of
a very different nature from the professional handling of
a surgeon, Hamlyn slowly unclosed his eyes; and, on
recognising the Colonel, attempted a faint smile.
“This is sad boy’s-play for a man of my years,” said
he, in a feeble voice. “But it was inevitable, my
dear
Hamilton. It was none of my seeking."
Perceiving the surgeon shake his head reprovingly at
this effort on the part of his patient, already exhausted
by loss of blood, Colonel Hamilton placed his finger on
his lips. Tears were coursing each other down his
cheeks. He had seen hundreds,-thousands,-slain in
battle. But this was the first time he had beheld a man
of peace slain by the hand of a fellow-citizen.—The
instincts of his manly heart shrank from the sight, as
from that of assassination.
“Has Mr. Henry left town?” he inquired, in a low
voice, of Ramsay, as Hamlyn again re-closed his eyes ;
and the butler's sign in the affirmative proved a sad dis-
appointment. Convinced that Hamlyn was rapidly
sinking, he thought it hard that neither of his sons
should be present, to receive his parting instructions, and
close his eyes.
“So died my poor boys!" was his involuntary reflection.
“ Neither kith nor kin at hand to receive their parting
breath. Cruel, indeed, upon poor Hamlyn!"
At that moment, a carriage stopped at the door; and
though the sound was scarcely noticed by the persons
present, the wounded man again, and with still greater
effort, renewed his inquiry of_“Is it my son Walter ?"

“Since you are so anxious, I will go as quick as
possible to the barracks, and follow the directions I
receive till I find him, and bring him back!” whispered
the Colonel, bending over his friend; and, on receiving a
grateful word of assent, hastened to quit the room. On
the stairs he encountered Brodie and a stranger; and
having hurriedly acquainted him with the state of the
case, returned for a moment into the drawing-room.
Not, however, to comfort its anxiously-expecting inmates.
The expression of his countenance apprised them that he
at least was without hope.
“Has any one sent for Harry ?” said he to Lydia,
perceiving that her mother was incapable of under-
standing or replying to the question; and, on being
answered in the negative, Colonel Hamilton rapidly
arranged with his daughter-in-law, that, while he pro-
ceeded to Knightsbridge, she should despatch Johnston
to Dean Park; that the news of the fatal event might
be communicated with due reserve to the member of
the family least capable of supporting the shock. A few
lines from Ellen were to entreat his instant return to
town.
“Poor Hamlyn,-poor Hamlyn!" murmured Colonel
Hamilton, when (after learning at the Barracks that,
for want of authority, no message had yet been despatched
to Wormholt Scrubbs after his master) he took pos-
session of Walter's horse and cab, and authorized the
groom to exercise to the utmost the speed of the finest
stepper in London. “In the possession of all that
renders life desirable, -rich, healthy, happy, active,
useful! A quarrel at the House of Commons, they say.
Ah! I feared no good would follow those cursed reports
I heard t'other day at Launchington's. Maybe, how-
ever, they belied him.—God grant it!—'Tis hard enough
to lose a friend ;-harder still to lose one's respect for
his memory.—But how-how am I to break this afflicting
news to Walter and Dartford ?”
The task was indeed a trying one. He found them in
the animated exercise of their professional duties, those
two brilliant and promising young men; who at the first
moment, seemed almost vexed at his unexpected intrusion

on the ground. But the sight of his fine horse in a
foam, and Colonel Hamilton pale and speechless, soon
convinced Walter that something must be sorely amiss.
In a few seconds, he had taken the groom's place in
the cab, and was galloping his horse back to town at a
still more frantic rate; while Lord Dartford, though for
a moment relieved by learning that the family-disaster
regarded not the being dearest to him in the world,
hastened to obtain from his commanding officer a re-
mission for Walter and himself from their duties of the
day; and was soon following them at a distance on his
charger, at the utmost speed compatible with field-day
accoutrements.

CHAPTER XXIII.
“ I do but hide
Under these words, like embers, every spark
Of that which has consumed me. Quick and dark
The grave is yawning. As its roof shall cover
My limbs with dust and worms, under and over;
So let oblivion hide this grief."-SHELLEY.
By the mercy of Heaven, Walter Hamlyn arrived in
Cavendish Square in time to comfort and support his
father by his presence during the painful operation of
extracting the ball, which had been deferred till after the
arrival of the second surgeon. . Dashing through the
crowd assembled as usual at the door in aggravation of
family afflictions, he had scarcely a moment to disen-
cumber himself of his uniform and throw on a dressing-
gown, in time to hang over the bed and stifle in his bosom
the groans of his father during the agonizing operation,
in which it was feared his strength might fail.
But the spell had already taken effect. While pre-
paring for the effort, Hamlyn's eyes had encountered the
form of his son, (Walter, the grandson of old Walter,)
and feeling he had yet something to live for,--something
to cherish him, even though exposed to worldly obloquy,
-he seemed to rally his courage ; and the Battersea

surgeon, whose finger was continually on his wrist, an-
nounced a sensible improvement in the state of the pulse.
The simple words, “My dear, dear father!" whispered by
the voice of Walter, had conveyed to the patient volumes
of exhortation and worlds of hope.
By the time Mr. Hamlyn was relieved from his
agony,
and his son from the almost equal torture of witnessing
it-by the time the two eminent surgeons had taken leave,
leaving the original attendant to watch over the results
of the assistance they had rendered, the afternoon was
far advanced. At present, it was impossible to surmise
the extent of the shock the system of the sufferer might
have sustained. But it was much that he was still alive.
The evening would show, by the usual accession of fever,
how far the constitution was affected. Meanwhile, per-
fect quiet, and, if possible, sleep, was to be prayed for.
Opiates had been largely administered,-straw was laid
down before the house,-the knocker removed,—the bell
muffled ;-and a policeman stationed at the adjoining
door to entreat the forbearance of inquirers. The answer
given to their anxious interrogation was the bulletin of
the surgeons that “Mr. Hamlyn's situation was pre-
carious; but that he was going on as favourably as could
be expected."
These wise precautions had not, however, prevented a
rumour of his death from gaining circulation in the me-
tropolis; and from thence, of course, reaching the pro-
vinces, so as to produce a precautionary meeting, on the
morrow, of the worthy and independent electors of Bar-
thorpe. The evening papers, nay, even a second edition
of one or two morning ones, contained a most detailed
and elaborate account of the duel, representing (of course
according to the politics of the divers journals) the
banker as a victim, and his antagonist as an assassin;
or the challenger as a rash and intemperate man, and
the Honourable Member for Alverstoke a reluctant self-
defender.
In both accounts, facts were distorted, descriptions
overcharged, and words attributed to both parties which
had neither escaped their lips, nor were likely to escape
the lips of men in their situation of life; and an illus-

penny paper, in addition to a picturesque descrip-
tion of the mill near which the “fatal meeting” had
taken place, a paragraph headed, “LATEST Particu- .
LARS, announced that “within the last quarter of an
hour Mr. Hamlyn had breathed his last.”
While, therefore, Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughters
were seated in breathless anxiety in the drawing-room in
Cavendish Square, listening every time the slightest
movement in the chamber overhead gave indication that
the factitious slumbers of the wounded man were broken,
while Lord Dartford, to satisfy the anxieties of Lydia,
proceeded every quarter of an hour to the bed-room door
to ascertain that all was proceeding favourably, and
Walter still watching by the bed-side,—the clubs of the
West End were deciding who was to fill the vacant seat
for Barthorpe, and whether the Honourable Member for
Alverstoke and Alberic Vernon would have to surrender,
in order to stand their trial; thus producing the loss of
a couple of opposition votes : such being the interesting
side of the fatal event to that idle, chattering class of
London life, to which the collision of heaven and earth
would be chiefly important as affording matter for
“news !"
At present, of course, public sympathy rested with
Hamlyn. It was clear that, whoever might be the
aggressor, the dead man was most to be pitied. All who
had heard him speak the preceding night, felt privileged
to be peculiarly horror-struck. Those who had seen the
carriages of Cooper and Brodie drive to the door in
Cavendish Square, having an anecdote to relate connected
with the event of the day, were, for a moment, objects of
interest. Nay, even common inquirers who had actually
seen the bulletin, acquired temporary importance.
It was precisely the sort of incident to set the West
End in a ferment. The Hamlyns were, in every way,
objects of interest. The approaching marriage of the
beautiful daughter, the university distinctions of the
gifted son, the popularity of the handsome Walter, were
enhancements of the ostensibility usually connected with
a banker and member of Parliament; and the peculiar
circumstances said to have instigated Hamlyn's recent

conversion to the orthodox tenets of political economy,
served only to animate the tongues of Rumour.
By dinner-time, Flimflam, who had gone the round of
his clubs to gather “exclusive information," and "original
anecdotes” connected with the duel, for the recreation of
a party he was to join at the house of a high legal func-
tionary, found his memory so overcharged with contra-
dictory accounts, all related on “undeniable authority,"
that it almost required a mnemonic process to convey
them so far as the Rolls House.
The only point on which the world was unanimous,
was one always insisted upon when duels prove fatal ;
namely, that the meeting ought to have been prevented,
either by the seconds, or the police. The quarrel had
been public, the provocation generally recognised as sure
to provoke a hostile explanation. Every man in London
consequently decided that all present at the affray ought
to be indicted for murder; though, had every man in
London been implicated the following day in a similar
affair, not one of them would have stirred his little finger
in obstruction of a similar result.
But while White's and Brookes’s were lying and slan-
dering in the levity of their hearts, as they ate their
oyster patés or waited for their cutlets, far deeper mis-
chief was produced in a quarter of the town where reports
have a market value, and a fortune is sometimes realized
by a dexterous fabrication.
Though the non-appearance of Mr. Hamlyn at the ::
banking-house, at his usual time, had produced no anxiety,
--thanks to the plausible explanation he had taken the
precaution of forwarding to Spilsby,—by the middle of the
day, tidings reached the city that the body of Hamlyn the
banker had been brought home to his house in Cavendish
Square; some said by a policeman, others, by a surgeon
who had vainly attempted to restore animation to the
corpse. To this positive announcement succeeded a ru-
mour, arising as rumours do,--none can tell how,-con-
necting the event with the fatal word—SUICIDE! It was
reported on 'Change that the unfortunate banker had
perished by his own hand; and whereas, in the city, one
only cause suggests itself to sicken a man of life-viz.,

353
scarcity of money,—though it could not be added to the
report, (as is usual in such cases,) that the policeman had
found only a few halfpence in the waistcoat-pocket of the
self-murderer, it was confidently stated that the rash açt
of the banker was produced by the hopeless derangement
of his affairs !-
It was luckily past three o'clock before this fatal tale
got wind; for, within a few minutes afterwards, the doors
in Lombard Street were besieged by a far denser crowd
of claimants, than those in Cavendish Square of obliging
inquirers. The answer of the clerks to such as pressed
for particulars of Mr. Hamlyn's death was," that they had
received a communication from him some hours before,
in his own handwriting; and that the messenger they had
despatched for information to the West End, was not yet
returned." Their reply to those who pressed for the
payment of their balance was prompt compliance; and it
was fortunate that the receipt that morning of the debt
of Schreiber and Co. relieved them from immediate
anxiety arising from the absence of their principal during
a run on the house.
Before Spilsby had found time to become alarmed, the
usual hour for closing arrived; and the last thing done
to appease the anxiety of those who were hurrying too
late to the door, was to 'exhibit a bulletin, stating that
Mr. Hamlyn had been wounded in a duel arising out of
differences the preceding night in the House of Commons,
but was going on as favourably as possible.
But though this authorized contradiction of the report
of his death had all the good effect anticipated by Spilsby,
it was impossible to say what sort of feeling, or even what
sort of contingencies, might arise, next morning, previous
to opening the bank. At all events, the head clerk, to
whom the private business of the house was so inade-
quately known, did not choose to take upon himself any
further responsibility; and he accordingly despatched an
express to Mr. Bernard Hamlyn, who was at his seat in
Suffolk, unluckily out of the line of railroad communica-
tion. As soon as the correspondence of the house was
closed for the evening, and, in the absence of the acting
partner, the keys delivered to himself, he proceeded to
2 A

354
THE BANKER'S WIFE ;
Cavendish Square, to ascertain the exact state of Mr.
Hamlyn, and take the instructions of his representa-
tives.
But this was no easy matter. In the first instance, he
was denied access to the house; orders to prevent all
disturbance or noise having been strictly issued. But
the servant to whom he had applied for admittance to
Mr. Hamlyn the preceding week, luckily recognising
his person, prevented his dismissal by the police. Once
within the hall, all seemed safe. But to whom was he
now to address himself ? One of Mr. Hamlyn's sons was
in the country,—the other in close attendance on the
dying man. Éven Ramsay had not a moment quitted
the sick-room since the operation. With respect to the
banker's wife and daughters, even had any one been pre-
vailed upon to disturb them, of what avail their inter-
ference ?
By good luck, the man with whom the clerk was in
communication was not only gratefully attached to his:
master, but by frequent attendance on Mr. Hamlyn to
the House, and gossiping with the servants of other men
of business, had imbibed some notion of the consequence
of a banker's calling. He perfectly understood his mas-
ter's life to be of more consequence to the community
than that of a Lord Edward Sutton; and, having allowed
Spilsby to station himself in the dining-room, promised
to acquaint him the moment an interview was possible
with Captain Hamlyn or Lord Dartford.
“ Colonel Hamilton has only this moment left the
house," said John. “'Tis a thousand pities but you had
spoken with Colonel Hamilton!" An opinion in which
Spilsby so strongly coincided, that when, half an hour
afterwards, the good old man returned, (having been
home to make inquiries concerning Johnston's departure
or arrival, and give orders in behalf of Ellen, who would
not, even for a moment, leave Mrs. Hamlyn,) before he
made his appearance in the drawing-room, an interview
was requested by the clerk.
“ Brodie saw Mr. Hamlyn an hour ago, and decides
him to be going on as favourably as possible,” said
Colonel Hamilton, concluding that the anxiety depicted

on the face of the bald-headed clerk proceeded solely
from the precarious condition of his employer.
“I am heartily glad to hear it, sir," replied Spilsby.
“Mr. Hamlyn has been a good friend to me, and has my
best wishes for his recovery. But, I am exceedingly
anxious, in the interim, to receive instructions from the
family. The responsibility of so considerable a business
as Mr. Hamlyn's must not be left upon my hands. I do
not occupy a confidential situation in the firm, and am
quite at a loss."
“Not more so, I take it, than either of his sons would
be," cried the Colonel, shrugging his shoulders. “ By
George, poor Hamlyn was right! It was essential that
one of those boys should be prepared to succeed him
in his business. But who could foresee what has hap-
pened?"
“ The fatal event of this morning, sir," resumed Spilsby,
“has occasioned a most unexpected run upon the house.
In the interval before opening to-morrow, confidence may
be in some degree restored by the discovery that the
report of Mr. Hamlyn's suicide was a libel,--and even of
his death, premature. But it is impossible to guess! A
run upon a banking-house, once begun, proceeds like the
conflagration of a house, as if stimulated by every new
attempt to arrest its progress.--I own I tremble for the
result."
6 Tremble for the result of what ?" cried the Colonel,
--fancying that, in the house of death, no interest could
prevail over that of the danger of the sufferer. Why
can't you speak plain, and speak out?"
“I mean, sir," resumed Spilsby, scarcely knowing
whether he dared consider the Colonel in any other light
than an important constituent," that, should the pressure
continue, we are unprepared to meet it without advice or
assistance from one of the partners.”
“Forced to suspend your payments ?” exclaimed the
astonished old man. “Gad! this must be looked to
immediately. This is a disastrous consequence of poor
Hamlyn's disablement which I had not thought of! I'm
expecting Harry Hamlyn (my friend's second son,-the
one who's intended for the firm) in town every minute.

I'll confer with him. If possible, I'll take an oppor-
tunity of asking a word of instruction, in the course of
the night, from Hamlyn himself. At what o'clock do
you open
?”
“At nine, sir.
you be here by seven ?"
“Certainly. But if I could possibly receive your in-
instructions to-night-"
“Come back, then, at twelve !" said Colonel Hamilton.
“By that time, I shall have seen Harry Hamlyn, and
taken his opinion on the matter.'
But when midnight and the bald-headed clerk arrived
together, no progress had been made, -no Henry Hamlyn
been heard of! On reaching Rugby, Johnston had ascer-
tained from Jacob Durdan, who was waiting for the up-
train, and had been at Dean Park in the morning for
tidings of the family, that Mr. Henry was neither there,
nor expected; and at the station, where Henry Hamlyn's
person was well known, it was stated that he had not re-
turned from his visit to town. To save time, therefore,
instead of cutting across the country to. Ovington, at
the loss of several hours, Johnston returned straight
to London, bringing back the unopened letter of Mrs.
Hamilton.
This was sore news to the Colonel, astounding news
to the clerk!
“I'm so poor a hand at business," said the former to
Spilsby, "that I scarcely know how to advise, without
the risk of doing mischief. But since matters are so
urgent, I recommend you to call together the friends of
the house; Hamlyn's solicitors, Crossman and Slack,-
Mrs. Hamlyn's brothers, the two Harringtons, (they're
no great friends, I fancy, with her husband, -but as her
trustees, they're forced to look to their sister's interests,)
--besides any business friends, of whom you've more
cognizance than I have. I will be present myself, as the
friend of the boys; and, late as it is, those gentlemen
should be apprised to-night. The matter is too moment-
ous to be trifled with !”
“I will hurry down instantly, sir, to Crossman,” said
the clerk, who had a cab in waiting. He keeps early

hours, and will be retired to rest. But he lives at his
house of business, and I can leave a note. I will also
proceed to Mr. Andrew Harrington's, in Bedford Square,
who is somewhere about the best adviser in London for
such a strait, besides being one of its largest capitalists."
This important business arranged, Colonel Hamilton
returned to Mrs. Hamlyn and the family, from whom he
was careful to conceal the name of the visitor to whom
he had been called away; and after entering kindly into
the dismay produced by Harry's non-appearance, and the
lamentations of the poor mother that the dreadful news
must now reach him abruptly, wherever he might happen
to be, the dispirited old man persuaded her to repair to
her chamber, and insisted that her daughters should
retire to bed. As a pretext for driving them away, he
stated his desire to take a few hours' rest on the draw-
ing-room sofa; Walter Hamlyn having declined his offer
of sharing his vigils beside the wounded man, who was
passing a better night than had been predicted.
By these arrangements, Colonel Hamilton was soon
left alone in that gorgeous apartment, of which Hamlyn
himself had been the sole occupant at that hour the pre-
ceding night. But in how different a frame of mind, and
with what opposite intentions! The banker had been steel-
ing his mind for a barbarous purpose and unchristian
encounter ;-the old man was devising projects of mercy
and peace. The banker had recoiled with horror from
reminiscences of a life of impenitence and hardness of
heart; the old man attempted to compose his fluttered
spirits by reflections full of tenderness and love. The
banker had attempted to nerve his courage for impending
danger by reliance on his usual good luck, and the false
energy produced by that deference to the opinion of the
world which had often enabled him to work miracles for
the redemption of his character ;-the old man, humbly
declining his head, recommended himself and those who
were dear to him to the protection of God!.
“In this very room,
was the last reflection that
soothed bis aching heart, “did my poor boys often
spend a cheerful holiday! Here, they used to think of

How different his sleep from that of the feverish
sufferer above! But he had not been more than three
hours at rest, when he was startled by a cold hand
placed upon
“What the deuce! Have I overslept myself ?” cried
he, starting from the sofa, in the belief that Johnston,
whom he had forewarned for the purpose, was come to
call him. But though all was dark in the room, save
where the cold dim light of a spring twilight struggled
through the chinks of the window-shutters, (the cur-
tains having been left undrawn in the confusion of the
night before,) he saw that the person by whom his hand
was so eagerly grasped was no servant. A few wild
words of explanation apprised him that, the fatal papers
having reached Cambridge with the rumour of his father's
death, Harry Hamlyn, reinstated at Trinity a few hours
before, had rushed into a post-chaise and hurried to
town.
“I was afraid I should be too late-oh, how afraid I
should be too late!” faltered he, opening his whole heart
at once to the man with whom he had not yet exchanged
fifty words, but whom he interpreted by his deeds into
everything that was just, generous, and humane. “For
it was more essential for me than for the rest to receive.
his last blessing. I am the only one of his children who
has ever crossed him. Are you aware that he once cursed
me ? — And to think that he might have died without a
word of forgiveness !”
Tears burst from the eyes of the distracted young man,
as, with clasped hands and heaving bosom, he uttered
those incoherent words.—“But he is better!” continued
he, struggling to recover himself. "He has passed a
good night. He has enjoyed some hours' sleep. I have
just left Walter. I have even knelt, unseen, by the bed-side
of my father, who must not be disturbed. But, before
relieving my brother from his watch, I could not help
coming to thank you, sir, for being here,—you and her?

359
you!”
It is so like you both! — God bless you, - God bless
All this time, Colonel Hamilton was striving to com-
pose his thoughts, and resume the chain of his over-night
considerations. It seemed grievous to molest the harassed
young man before him, weary with a night's travelling as
well as distracted by a night's anguish, with mere words
of business ; – to arrest the warm current of his filial
feelings by dry obstacles of worldly solicitude. But it
was indispensable. The interests of too many human
beings were dependent on the event. In as few words,
therefore, as possible, Colonel Hamilton explained to
Henry the critical position of his father's affairs; and the
vital necessity that measures should be adopted without
delay.
To his surprise, very little emotion was produced by
the announcement. Either Harry was strangely ignorant
of the magnitude of the transactions in which his father's
house was engaged; or the blow by which he had been
previously smitten, had morally stunned him. 80.com-
pletely, indeed, did he appear bewildered, and so tho-
roughly absorbed by the idea of his father's danger, that
Colonel Hamilton judged it his duty to touch upon two
strings, which, in the first instance, he had delicately
avoided. He spoke of the future welfare of his mother
and sisters ; he spoke of the dishonour likely to fall upon
the name of his father!
“Let us go, then,” faltered Harry. - There is not a
moment to be lost. Let us hasten into the city." And
after attempting in vain to reduce his disordered dress
and haggard looks to an air of decorum, he hurried
Colonel Hamilton to his father's dressing-room, adjoining
the study below, where breakfast was set out; and each
drank a cup of tea ere they proceeded into the city in a
hackney-coach.
The streets were nearly empty. The shops, slowly
unclosing their windows in the more commercial quarter
of the town, began to restore an air of life and decency
to streets paraded, an hour before, only by the outcasts
of the metropolis, and the police stationed there for their
coercion; and by the time they reached Lombard Street,

though the clocks had not yet struck seven, the city
shop-boys were engaged in making, by their irrigations,
the pavement impassable.
On drawing up, the door was partly unclosed by the
old porter of the compting-house, who appeared to have
been posted there in expectation; and as they passed
onwards into the private room, where Spilsby now reigned
supreme, the old man plucked young Hamlyn by the
sleeve to inquire after his poor master. It woul have
been a comfort to Harry, had his own heart been less
full, to perceive that this venerable servitor had tears in
eyes.
Though they were before their time, the clerks, the
Harringtons, the solicitors, and two strangers, (one of
whom was introduced to Colonel Hamilton as the stock-
broker charged with the business of the house,) were
already assembled; the books open on the table before
them, and their lengthened countenances bearing ominous
testimony to the unsatisfactory nature of the examination.
Even the intelligence brought by the new comers that
Mr. Hamlyn had passed a good night, and was going on
as well as possible, did little towards unbending the
brows of the gloomy synod.
No one seemed anxious to be the first to speak, seeing
that
every word uttered must be an accusation against
the acting partner of the house; in his absence, and the
presence of his son. But, had any spectator, personally
uninterested in the scene, been present, he could scarcely
have failed to observe, that the deference habitually
testified towards Hamlyn and Co. by Crossman and Slack,
was already transferred to Colonel Hamilton, the Dives
of the party.
“I am extremely sorry to say, sir,” observed Spilsby,
after due salutation to Henry Hamlyn and his venerable
companion, “ that matters wear a still more unpromising
aspect than I represented to you last night. Various
securities on which I had counted as of an available
nature, are unaccountably missing; and, though I have
no doubt that Mr. Hamlyn, on his restoration to health,
will be able to enlighten us as to his manner of disposing
of them, at present we are wholly in the dark. From

indications afforded by Mr. Andrew Harrington and his
brother, I have reason to fear that the run upon the
house will continue unabated; and that the report of
Mr. Hamlyn's death by his own hand, having reached
our country correspondents, the post will bring in heavy
demands. Mr. Bernard Hamlyn has not yet arrived in
town; and I have only twenty thousand pounds and a
fraction to open with this morning!”-
At this announcement, the two solicitors looked at
each other with an air of blank amazement; the two
uncles upon Henry, with a gaze of mournful compassion;
while the stockbroker and his companion elevated their
eyebrows, and muttered to the heads of their canes some-
thing unintelligible.
“ In which
case,
to
open at all were an act of insanity,
observed Andrew Harrington, in a decided tone.
it is impossible that such a business as this should be so
utterly unprovided with resources.”
“Mr. Hamlyn managed the concern in his own way,
sir, admitting no person into his confidence,” replied
Spilsby. “ řill Mr. Bernard Hamlyn shall arrive, I am
prepared to say nothing."
“And if he don't arrive, the house must stop pay-
ment?” demanded Colonel Hamilton, coming abruptly
to the point.
A distressing silence afforded the only reply to this
direct apostrophe.
"God bless my soul!_Can nothing be done ?” cried
the Colonel. “Surely poor Hamlyn, who has so many
friends, and acted so liberally to all the world, is not to
be disgraced on his deathbed, for want of a moneyed man
or two willing to come forward in his behalf? You, sir,'
continued he, turning towards Andrew Harrington-
"you, who are so near a connexion of the family, surely
you
will do the part of a kinsman by this unfortunate
"I will do the part of a brother by his wife, and her
children shall be to me as my own," was the stern reply
of the uncompromising London merchant. “ But if the
risk of half-a-crown of mine would keep Richard Hamlyn
out of the Gazette, I would not put it down. I speak

for brother and self. We are here as trustees for the
wife and children.-Excuse me, Harry !—You are not in
a state to judge of my motives. But that I respect your
filial feelings, my dear nephew, I would say more."
Messrs. Crossman and Black, perceiving by the counte-
nance of Colonel Hamilton that he was disposed to resent
this churlishness on the part of Mrs. Hamlyn's wealthy
brothers, fancied they were serving their own cause, if
not their client's, in endeavouring to shake the resolution
of Harrington Brothers, by representing the pressure on
Hamlyn's house to be temporary; and that, with a little
. assistance from without, the firm would be able not only
to weather the storm, but take its stand with additional
credit in the moneyed world, from this demonstration of
strength. But, even after this appeal, the brothers-in-
law and stockbroker remained mute. It was clear that
they thought otherwise.
“Meanwhile,” cried Henry Hamlyn, suddenly with-
drawing the clasped hands with which he had concealed
his face,—"nothing is done,-and my father's credit is
at stake, the fruit of twenty years' undeviating integrity
and unwearied labour!—He must not only die in the
prime of life, but die disgraced !"
Andrew Harrington uttered not a syllable. His
brother Thomas was troubled with a short dry cough,
which appeared of evil omen to Spilsby, whose hope of
assistance from what were called the friends of the
house” was becoming gradually extinguished.
“Were there time to call around us my father's friends
and colleagues," persisted Harry,—" or had I only a
dozen hours before me, I should feel safe. But if those
on whom we have the claims of blood-
“I tell ye what!” interrupted Colonel Hamilton,
laying his hand graspingly on Harry's arm, to forestal
fruitless expostulation, and addressing the rest of the
party,—“I am myself nowise akin to Richard Hamlyn,
and no otherwise interested in his welfare than as friend
to friend. But in my view, that's a holier bond than
many folks are disposed to admit; and so, I'm willing to
stand the gist of what others are startled at. I've a
matter of about two hundred thousand pounds, say two

hundred thousand, in various securities lodged with the
house, most of them tangible; and all I can say is, that
the firm is welcome to convert as much of them into
money, for its own purposes, as will carry it safely through
the storm.”
A murmur of gratitude and admiration burst from the
solicitors, stockbrokers, and clerk, wholly indifferent to
Colonel Hamilton; who had his reward in the silent
pressure of the hand bestowed on him by his own and
Ellen's young friend.—But he could not but notice, that
Andrew Harrington and his brother regarded him with
a look of the same contemptuous pity they would have
bestowed on a patient escaped from a Lunatic Asylum.
“We must lose no time," said the stockbroker, looking
at his watch. “We have brought it to half-past seven.
I shall be happy to accommodate the firm with twenty
thousand, on the responsibility and receipt of Colonel
Hamilton,-as there will be no time for the realization
of the securities to which he alludes-
“Or if deposited with me," said the other friend of
the house, who proved to be an extensive Russia merchant,
under considerable obligations to the house of Hamlyn
and Co.,—"I shall be happy to advance their full
amount.”
“ You allude, I conclude, sir,” said Spilsby, whose
countenance ever since the hostile declarations of the
two Harringtons had been subsiding from pale to paler,
_" to the sum of £84,742 and a fraction, standing in
the 3 per cent. Consols, in the joint names of yourself
and Mr. Hamlyn?"-
“To that,--to my Long Annuities - India Bonds,-
and other matters. But I
suppose
the
money
in the
funds is most come-at-able," said the Colonel. “ This
gentleman I understand to be the broker of the firm.
Let him conclude the sale, bring me the necessary papers,
and I will sign them before I leave the house."
And while Crossman and Slack proceeded to murmur
all the nouns in their vocabulary nearest related to the
cardinal virtues,—such as—“liberality,-generosity,
disinterestedness,—nobleness,-magnanimity, friendship,
etc., etc.,"-Spilsby affected to busy himself with careful

examination of a folio marked in white on a red ground
with a stupendous H; and a variety of day-books,
stock-receipts, and miscellaneous papers, that bore refer-
ence to Colonel Hamilton's account with the house.
At length, after prodigious rustlings and shufflings, and
opening and shutting of tin boxes, the bald-headed clerk
summoned the stockbroker into a corner, and commenced
a whispered dialogue, which one or two of those present
seemed inclined to resent as a lapse of confidence. It
did not, however, last long. With a face of ashy pale-
ness and quivering lips, Spilsby returned to the table
which the others had not quitted; and, after muttering
an unintelligible preamble concerning his own horror on
the occasion, stated that he had reason to believe the
stock in question was not forthcoming; that his friend
Mr. Slicem, to whom he had just referred, perfectly
remembered having at divers times disposed, for Mr.
Hamlyn, of large portions of the stock in question, which,
at the last sale, had dwindled to a few thousands.
“And yet, strange and melancholy to say,” pursued
the clerk,“ no entry of these sales appears to have been
carried to Colonel Hamilton's account!"
"I feared as much !" was the whispered ejaculation of
Andrew Harrington to his brother.
“I had, perhaps, better take this opportunity of
stating,” resumed Spilsby with blanched lips, “ that the
course of examination into the private accounts of the
firm in which I have passed the night, gives me reason
to fear that other securities of a similar nature will prove
deficient."
“Sell my stock ?-Dispose of my property ?"--mur-
mured Colonel Hamilton. Well, 'tis my own fault!
I gave him free leave.”
“The sooner this transaction is cleared the better!"
cried Andrew Harrington. “In half an hour, either
this house must open, or suspend its payments. The
question of embezzlement or non-embezzlement must be
premonitorily cleared up. Mr. Spilsby can ascertain
from Colonel Hamilton's account the nature of the
securities which ought, in his instance, to be in deposit.
If missing-"

The bald-headed clerk interrupted the somewhat
severe schooling of Mr. Harrington, by addressing in a
low voice to Colonel Hamilton a succession of inquiries,
to which answers were returned aloud by the veteran,
with irrepressible exclamations of surprise.
“ Gone ?”—cried he. “ The India Bonds sold ?—The
Spanish too ?-In short, I'm to look on myself as a
ruined man!"
Spilsby had not courage to meet the eyes of the old
soldier; still less, to utter a syllable in reply.
“Well, well!” cried he. “ At all events, Moonjee's
remittances are at present on the high seas. Thanks
be to Providence, I may still find butter to my bread.
And to think that the friend in whom I confided as in
God above, should have done this !--The Lord forgive
him ! But the unfortunate fellow is making heavy
atonement.”
The stockbroker, who, at Spilsby's suggestion, had
hurried home to his office in Birchin Lane to consult his
books respecting the transactions in question, now re-
appeared, breathless and agitated, with confirmation of
their worst suspicions.
“There's a terrible press without, awaiting the opening
of the doors,” said he. 'I had nearly my coat torn off
by people applying for information, as one connected
with the business of the house. All I could say at all
satisfactory was, that there appeared every probability
of Hamlyn's recovery.—But it was not that they cared
for!”
“I see no use in attempting to keep up the farce !"
said Andrew Harrington, in a determined voice. “My
nephew having left the room, poor fellow, I state at once
my opinion, that to open the house for the despatch of
business is wholly out of the question. It is impossible
to surmise to what amount the credit of Hamlyn may be
compromised. The firm appears to have been involved
at old Hamlyn's death. Ever since, instead of retrieving
himself by self-denial and economy, his son has been
plunging deeper and deeper into the mire, and atteinpting
to cut the knot of his difficulties by mad and unjustifiable
speculations. My remonstrances only produced enmity

between us ;—and Heaven knows it is no satisfaction to
me that my predictions concerning my unfortunate sister's
family have so speedily come to pass.".
No one interrupted him. Colonel Hamilton was gone
in search of Harry, whom he found exhausted by anguish
of mind, half fainting on one of the chests in the
compting-house. The solicitors were consulting together
in what shape to insure priority of payment to their
claims upon the firm; and it was only the stockbroker
and Russia merchant who remained with Spilsby to
coincide in the decision of the Harringtons, that circulars
should be instantly printed, announcing the temporary
closing of the house of Hamlyn and Co., on account of
the precarious condition of the acting partner, and the
absence of the junior!
The paper having been hastily drawn up by Spilsby
under Andrew Harrington's directions, was conveyed by
Slicem to the parties who undertake the printing and
dissemination of such documents. But, as he quitted.
the house, and attempted to make his way down the
door-steps, as densely crowded as the entrance to a
theatre previous to opening the doors, a carriage and
four dashed along the street, and drew up as near as the
gathering of the mob would allow.
The crest upon the travelling-carriage was noticed.
In a moment, it was whispered, and in the next, positively
known, that the traveller was no other than the junior
partner of Hamlyn's firm; and, as it opportunely occurred
to the stockbroker that his arrival might produce some
modification in the paper he carried in his pocket, he
applied to the policemen previously keeping order in that
tumultuous assemblage, to facilitate his passage through
the crowd.
When, therefore, Bernard Hamlyn, an enfeebled,
fractious invalid, was assisted out of his carriage by a
stout, burly individual, whom some concluded to be his
valet de chambre, and some, with more truth, his country
attorney, he was conveyed into the banking-house
between two policemen, giving him the air of a delinquent
in custody; much to the aggravation of his natural
nervousness and incompetency.

Bernard Hamlyn was a meagre, feeble, under-sized!
man, having hair and eyelashes the colour and texture of
silk, and a voice like a broken pan-pipe.
“I received your letter by express late last night,
gentlemen," said he, fretfully addressing the persons he
found assembled in the private room. “Why you have
summoned me here I cannot guess. I am unfit for the
effort of such a journey,—very unfit. I am unprepared
to interfere in the concerns of the house, wholly unpre-
pared. All I have to ask, therefore, is that you will
communicate your wishes as speedily as possible to this
gentleman, my legal adviser, who will act in concert
with you—to which effort I am unequal,--altogether
unequal."
From this preamble, it was pretty clear that the junior
partner brought no accession of counsel to the consulta-
tion; and it was soon equally apparent that the means .
of the selfish hypochondriac were as shallow as his wit.
His whole fortune was embarked in the firm; and the
country attorney, who evidently came prepared to pro--
tect the egotism of his employer from molestation and
his fortune from risk, was soon compelled to knock
under, and announce to Bernard Hamlyn, on the showing
of his shrewder brother lawyers, Crossman and Slack, that
he was, in reality, far nearer a fiat of bankruptcy, than he
fancied himself to be to his grave.
“It is very hard I should be routed out of my country
retirement to listen to such harassing details as these !"
faltered the man, who had hitherto conceived the business
of a banker to consist in receiving quarterly an income
of six thousand a-year.
“I am unequal to such a shock,
very unequal. I am a sad invalid, -a very sad invalid.
My medical attendant assured me that this hurried.
journey might have a most serious effect upon a man in
my state of health.”
No one gave ear to his peevish grumblings; not even
the burly attorney. Each man present was intent on
his own share in the calamity, against which there was
no further hope of succour. Each was calculating the
amount of his impending losses ; with the exception of
Colonel Hamilton, who exerted himself to remove the

still half-insensible Henry from the spot, ere the posting
of the placard should announce the closing of the house.
The old porter was sobbing helpless behind the door
as they passed; and the despairing countenances and
ferocious eyes that met Colonel Hamilton's view in the
throng without, as the policeman assisted them into
their hackney-coach, had not faded from his recollection,
when, after a slow return towards the West End, they
reached the inauspicious purlieus of Cavendish Square.
On entering the coach, the old man had taken the arm
of the unresisting Henry under his, and kept his hand
fondly clasped within his own, till they approached
together the “house no more his home.” Not a token
of consciousness or recognition escaped the heart-broken
young man.
Colonel Hamilton was forced to assist him
from the coach, as he would have assisted the helplessness
of a child.
So thoroughly absorbed was he, indeed, by the alarming
state of exhaustion of his young friend, and so bewildered
by the exciting scenes which had been passing before his
eyes, that he took no note of the aspect of the servants
who met him on the door-steps. Even when Johnston
addressed him in the hall, the deplorable condition of
the fine young fellow leaning on his arm was more to the
Colonel than any tidings he could have to learn con-
cerning the wounded man.
He led him into the study, as though the house were
his own and poor Harry a visitor, and placed him silently
on the sofa. At that moment, Mrs. Hamilton, who had
been watching anxiously for their arrival, hurried into
the room.
On perceiving Colonel Hamilton leaning over the
half-fainting Henry, she beckoned him towards her, and
would fain have spoken. But the kind old soul, whose
eyes were obscured by gathering tears, forestalled the
question he fancied her about to ask.
“Yes! all is over, Nelly !” said he. “ The house has
stopped payment. Go to him. Say a kind word to him.
The
poor fellow has no longer a guinea in the world-
Ere he could add another syllable, Ellen was beside
the scarcely conscious young man; taking his hands into

her's, pressing them to her lips, her eyes, rather with the
wild tenderness of a mother who finds a lost child
restored to her, than the shamefacedness of a mistress or
sober affection of a wife.
“ Mine for ever!" whispered she, with streaming eyes,
as she pressed him to her heart. “ Ours for ever!" she
repeated, turning towards Colonel Hamilton, who had
advanced towards them, and was contemplating with
deep feeling the fervent nature betrayed at such a
moment by the woman he had often thought too cold,
and too reserved.
Taking their united hands in his, he murmured a
fervent blessing on their heads. And then, for the first
time since he became aware of the family dishonour, the
tears of Henry Hamlyn burst forth.
Alas! he knew not yet one-half his cause for sorrow!
-The motive of Ellen's impatience to meet them by the
way was only to soften by due preparation the announce-
ment of a new calamity.
During their absence in the city, Mr. Hamlyn had
breathed his last!-
CHAPTER XXIV.
“My youth hath acted
Some scenes of vanity, drawn out at length
By varied pleasures,-sweeten'd in the mixture,
But tragical in the issue. Beauty, pomp,
With every sensuality our giddiness
Doth frame an idol, are inconstant friends
When any troubled passion makes us halt
On the unguarded castle of the mind.”-FORD.
As the unnatural composure produced by the adminis-
tration of strong opiates subsided, the wounded man had
exhibited symptoms of irritability which produced con-
siderable alarm in the mind of his attendant; who, within
half an hour of Colonel Hamilton's departure for the
city, had judged it necessary to send for the surgeons
to
whose higher judgment his patient had been entrusted.
Scarcely was this measure taken, when Hamlyn him-

self seemed conscious of a change.-His eyes kept wan-
dering round, as if in search of some unseen object; and
when told, on inquiring for Walter, that his son was
dozing on the sofa at the foot of his bed, he suddenly
asked for Harry. With the sort of clairvoyance that
appears to inspire dying persons, he seemed aware of
Henry's arrival in town during the night.
The reply of Ramsay, though intended to restore his
master to composure, was unluckily calculated only to
stimulate his restlessness.
“Mr. Henry and Colonel Hamilton are gone to Lom-
bard Street, sir," said the butler, in his usual deferential
tone. “The head-clerk was here late last night; and
the Colonel desired he might be called at seven, to be at
the banking-house before opening-time.'
A sudden shiver pervaded the frame of his unfortunate
master.
“ They are gone?—You are quite sure that they are
gone, and at the summons of Spilsby ?”—said he, in an
unnaturally hoarse voice."
Quite sure, sir. Mr. Henry spent half-an-hour by
your bed-side in the night; and very much afflicted and
broken he looked, when he stepped into the coach with
Colonel Hamilton.”
A moan escaped the lips of the banker, as his head
sank back upon the pillow; and when Ramsay bent over
him to hold the usual restoratives to his nostrils, a cold
dew was rising on the livid face.
“ Call Walter !”—said his master, faintly.
Captain Hamlyn is still asleep,” replied Ramsay,
remembering his master's former anxious injunction that
his son should on no account be disturbed.
“ Call him,-or it will be too late!”-persisted Mr.
Hamlyn. And in another moment, poor Walter, roused
from one of those dreams of love and peace with which
some evil influence seems to delight in mocking the
anguish of the unhappy,—the condemned felon in his
cell,--the exile in his banishment, was standing beside
the bed of death.
“Nearer !"-said Mr. Hamlyn, as the young man, still
imperfectly awakened, stood bewildered by his side.

of-
Stoop down to me, Walter! Listen to me, my son!
I am going where there will be an end of human love,"
faltered the dying man, contemplating with fixed and
glazing eyes the face bending over him in unspeakable
anguish. " Walter! do not curse me when I am gone!-
I have loved you very dearly-do not think too hardly of
your poor father !”
My dearest, dearest father,- let me call for help!"
exclaimed his son, perceiving that his last moment was
drawing near. "Surely you will see my mother-my
sisters ?—There is yet time, if you desire spiritual con-
solation"
“I desire only you !" replied the dying man. “It is too
late for repentance, Walter,—too late even for explanation.
But the grave covers all! My life has been a mistake,-
beginning in error, ending in crime! My father was a
spendthrift.—He left me only a ruined business, an em-
barrassed estate. I loved him living, I loved his memory,

ance became more and more impeded. Yet, by a sudden
effort, as if roused by the tears that fell profusely from.
the eyes of Captain Hamlyn, he put forth his hand
already cold with the approach of death, and drawing
down the face of his son towards him, imprinted upon
his lips a fervent kiss,—the first since childhood.
As he relinquished his hold, his head fell back heavily
on the pillow.-His eyes fixed eagerly and searchingly
upon those of Captain Hamlyn, never afterwards to be
withdrawn. In a moment, a strange gurgling sound
was audible in his throat. Blood, mingled with foam,
burst from his lips ;-and though his eyes still remained
riveted on those of his son, there was no longer meaning
in their gaze.—Already, they were fixed in death!
Before the arrival of the surgeons, all was over; and
their countenances in quitting the house forestalled any

necessity for announcement, to those without, of the
fatal event. The afflicting news had been cautiously
revealed to Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughters by Mrs.
Hamilton, previous to the Colonel's arrival; and while
Ellen was lavishing her gentle words and endearments
upon Henry, Walter was striving to support the courage
of his mother sufficiently to enter the chamber of death,
with the poor girls, who yearned to look for the last time
upon their father's face.
A similar feeling soon suggested itself to Harry, even
amid the consolations so precious to his heart; and
Colonel Hamilton lent him his arm to the door of the
He forbore, however, to enter ;-feeling that, at
such a moment, the kindred of the dead ought to be
alone with their dead.
When Henry entered, the three broken-hearted
women were on their knees in prayer, around the bed.
Walter was standing beside his mother, with his tearful
eyes fixed like hers upon the now powerless form and
passionless face, instinct but a few hours before with
vigour, intellect, command ;—and the moment the door
opened, the two brothers, thus meeting for the first time
since their calamity, rushed instinctively into each other's
arms, and clung to each other weeping, -as if tacitly
expressing a pledge and promise of strengthened fraternal
love. Neither of them had, at that 'moment, a thought
or care that was not comprised in the senseless form
before them, and the sorrowing women at their feet.
In presence of their dead father, worldly poverty and
worldly shame were mere words to their ear; and while
all London was ringing with the ruin and wretchedness
of the Hamlyns, they were united in that little chamber,
taking no thought of silver or gold; willing to squander
the wealth of the world, had it been placed at their
disposal, to restore animation to him who lay extended
on that blood-stained bed,—the victim of one of those
privileged assassinations authorized by the customs of
civilized life.
But the sight of those helpless sisters and mother
served to restore poor Henry to a sense of their terrible
situation. His mother must be warned, his brother

373
must be apprised that they were penniless and disgraced,
as well as bereft of husband and father.
He was fortunately relieved from the duty of inform-
ing his beloved mother of the unsuspected aggravation of
her misfortunes. The instant her brothers became aware
of the event which had taken place in Cavendish Square,
both hastened to her side, with entreaties that she would
quit the house with her family, and accept a home with
one or the other. But of this removal she would not
hear. So long as the breathless form of their father re-
mained there, she felt it to be the fitting abiding-place of
her children, and on her expressing this feeling, firmly
and strongly, Mr. Harrington, with as much delicacy as
was consistent with his straightforward habits, apprised
her of the doubly melancholy position in which they were
placed.
That instant, she desired to be left alone with her
brothers. She did not choose that her innocent girls, still
less that her noble-minded sons, should hear the terrible
question she was about to ask, and to ask with fear and
trembling, under the roof still sheltering him who was
gone to his account. The house had stopped payment.
It was a misfortune ;—but she and hers could work,-
she and hers could want. All she desired to know was,
whether that misfortune were connected with a crime!
Hamlyn and Co. were insolvents, bankrupts, ruined,
lost; but She had not courage to pronounce the
fatal question !
Her compassionate brother understood her; and at-
tempted, as best he might, to soften the blow he was
compelled to deal, in narrating the startling discoveries
which had taken place. As if such griefs were to be pal-
liated! Say what he might, the fact was before her in
all its cruel atrocity. She knew all that the honest man
before her must be feeling; or rather she knew it not,
for the moment she fully understood that knavery of
the blackest kind was attributed to the father of her
children, she sank into utter insensibility.
In this state, she was consigned by her brother to the
care of Mrs. Hamilton; who was taking on herself the
care and responsibility of an adopted daughter of the

house; and while Ellen, Lydia, and Miss Creswell placed
her in bed, and tendered all the aid available to one whose
soul is utterly crushed by accumulated misfortunes, the
Harringtons and Colonel Hamilton entered into delibe-
rate discussion of the further steps necessary to be taken
for the family. An inquest must of course be held on the
body of Mr. Hamlyn; and Andrew Harrington insisted
upon placing in the hands of Walter a considerable sum
for the immediate needs of the establishment.
Little accustomed to receive pecuniary favours, and
still less disposed to receive them from his harshly-spoken
uncle, Captain Hamlyn was about to reject the offer, when
Andrew Harrington interrupted him.
“ You have no right to trifle with the destinies of your
mother,” said he. Henceforward, the responsibilities
of a family-man are on your shoulders; and the sooner
you accustom yourself to the idea that nothing now be-
longs to you in this house, the better. These are afflict-
ing words, Walter; but you will expose yourself to bit-
terer mortifications than any you are likely to meet at
the hands of a kinsman who loves
you,
unless
up your mind, at once, to the just decree which appor-
tions all you have been accustomed to consider your own,
to the creditors of your father. It is on this account, I
would fain have my poor Sophia and her girls lodged
under
my
roof.”
Satisfied that reflection would convey a better lesson
to the bewildered young man than all his exhortations,
the sturdy merchant left him to himself. But scarcely
had he quitted the house, when Walter was exposed from
another quarter to equally kind solicitations.
“I have insisted upon the privilege of family connexion
to intrude upon you, my dear Captain Hamlyn," said
Lady Rotherwood, who chose to accompany her nephew
on his return to the house. “I am come in the name of
my sister, who cannot altogether entrust her message to
Dartford and is too ill and nervous to leave the house,
to express a hope that your mother and the girls will
take shelter in her quiet house from the distressing scenes
that await them here. To dear Lydia's company, she
feels entitled. But she has a heart and home for them

all, if you will prevail on Mrs. Hamlyn to regard her, and
all of us, in the affectionate light in which we wish to be
considered.”
Lord Dartford now broke in with entreaties to his
friend to comply with the wishes of the Marchioness ;
and Walter, who saw they were fully aware of the ruin
of his family, felt deeply impressed by their prompt re-
newal of attentions to the widow of the bankrupt! Very
little, however, did he suspect the full amount of their
generosity. Very little did he conjecture that the rumour
circulated by the Flimflams perpetually gossiping in Lon-
don clubs and London society, had already reached Lady
Dartford that the timely death of Hamlyn the banker had
saved him from transportation,-perhapsfrom the gallows!
"It is impossible for Mrs. Hamlyn and her daughters
to remain here, my dear Walter," exclaimed Lord Dart-
ford. “Still less would it be advisable for them to remove
to Dean Park. If they will not give my mother the hap-
piness of receiving them in town, at least prevail on them
to make Dartford Hall their home. There they would be
quite alone, quite unmolested, quite independent. There
the indulgence of their grief would be undisturbed. I
scarcely know how to say it, but it is necessary to add
that a thousand pounds have been paid by my banker, in
Mrs. Hamlyn's name, to a credit opened for her at
Drummond's.”
These generous offers were received by Walter with
due acknowledgment; but an entreaty that the sun
might go down on their grief, ere any future measures
were determined. For the whole family, rest was indis-
pensable. Early on the morrow, the inquest was to be
held, which was to decide whether propitiatory victims
were to be offered up to the memory on which, at that
moment, execrations were being heaped from every quar-
ter; and Captain Hamlyn was convinced that, till the
remains of his father were consigned to the grave,
the
widow would remain faithful to her post.
While the affliction of the survivors was thus conside-
rately dealt with, the outcries against the baseness and
hypocrisy of the fraudulent bankrupt became not only
deep, but loud. He had deceived everybody. He had

abused the confidence of everybody. Friend and foe
were alike involved in his ruin. The blow of the failure
of Hamlyn and Co. had a stirring effect in the city. If
they were insecure, who was solid ?—If the pains-taking,
virtuous, exemplary Hamlyn was a knave, whose honesty
was to be trusted ?- More than one banking-house of the
highest reputation had cause to rue the discoveries of
that day!
- But amid the disregarded clamours and lamentations
of the injured cliency of the house, those more immedi-
ately connected with it were its bitterest assailants. The
first document secured by Spilsby, in his search during
the night preceding Richard Hamlyn's decease, was the
fatal paper whose signature was so compromising to him-
self; and this once committed to the flames, he felt re-
established in the security of innocence, and privileged
to purchase his own indemnity by zeal in detecting the
delinquencies of his late employer, and fervour in point-
ing them out. Before the grave had closed over Richard
Hamlyn, the Gazette completed the ruinous publicity
which the details of the inquest had shadowed forth.
The daily papers now teemed with anecdotes of his
crimes and misdemeanours. It was the interest of the
Vernon family, and the friends of the still more deeply
implicated offender by whose hand he had fallen, to clothe
his name and cause with all the obloquy only too easy to
impart; and already, the memory of the man so long
without spot or blemish, was loaded with the opprobrium
of a commercial swindler and political adventurer, whose
disastrous end was a mere matter of retribution.
There was something almost fiendish, meanwhile, in
the malignant care with which Spilsby, and his advisers,
Messrs. Crossman and Slack, contrived to place the frauds
and embezzlements of Hamlyn in the clearest light.
Though, till the first meeting of creditors, there was no :
need to publish the particulars of the funds abstracted
and securities misapplied, the newspapers were soon in
possession of circumstances that could only have been
derived from authority; and not a private paper, not a
secret memorandum, of the man so cautious in his frauds
that his very shadow was scarcely admitted to participa-

377
tion, but had become matter for advertisements on all the
walls and palings of the metropolis, to augment the sale
of the Sunday papers!
Such is the short-sighted cunning of the crafty ;-such
the dangerous hollowness of ostentation. The delin-
quencies perpetrated by the banker, had originated solely
in a desire to create a false seeming of opulence and dig-
nity. And now, not a huckster within twenty miles of
Dean Park,-not an apprentice in the City of London,-
but was aware to a fraction of the amount to which old
Walter Hamlyn had been involved at his death, and of
the annual thousands abstracted by his son from the pro-
perty of his constituents, to enable him to give costly
dinner-parties, - figure at royal entertainments, -and
maintain in the history of the shire of Warwick the fac-
titious consequence of Hamlyn of Dean Park.
Already, in his shroud, the man of immaculate virtue
was recognised as a knave ;—the man of exquisite dis-
sembling, unmasked. The very beggar at the crossing in
Lombard Street who had been wont to profit by his pha-
risaical alms-giving, would not for worlds have exchanged
the memory of his life of mud and rags, hunger and cold,
for that of the man of purple and fine linen, who had
dipped in the dish with princes of the blood, -fattened
on the good things of this world,-commanded the cheers
of parliament,-the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and
the confidence of dupes.
During the first few days succeeding his decease, the
person who had most to suffer from the scorn heaped on
his memory was Lord Dartford. Walter and Henry
were confined to the house, almost to their bed; and care
was taken by the servants that no newspapers should
reach the hands of either. But the Marquis, though the
greater portion of his time was spent in Cavendish Square,
could neither turn a disregardful eye to the statements
that met him at every turn, nor a deaf ear to the entrea-
ties of his uncle, Lord Crawley, that he would seriously
consider to what extent his honour was pledged, ere he
degraded the unblemished name of his family by con-
nexion with that of one of the most consummate villains
of modern times.

378
THE BANKER'S WIFE;
“I should be a still greater villain myself, if, for a
moment, I deserted my affianced wife and brothers-in-
law,” replied the Marquis. “ On the contrary, I am in
hopes my mother will accelerate the period fixed by her-
self for my marriage, in order the sooner to redeem my
dearest Lydia from a name that so ill becomes her. The
first thing she did on learning her father's insolvency,
was to release me from my engagement; and were she
aware of the odious circumstances connected with it, ex-
cess of delicacy would perhaps inspire her with the deter-
mination never to become my wife. With all due defer-
ence to your authority, therefore, dear uncle, nothing will
be left undone, on my part, to hasten the solemnization
of our marriage.”
But this generous resolution did not prevent him from
being hourly molested by some new proof of Hamlyn's
cold blooded hypocrisy, or some fresh instance of the dis-
tress occasioned in private life by his fraudulent transac-
tions. Lord Dartford trembled at the idea of what his
friend Walter might have to undergo when he emerged
from his present retirement.
At present, his attention was absorbed by his painful
duty towards those denounced by the finding of the In-
quest, as the “WILFUL MURDERERS” of his father!
The first bitter intimation imparted to the Hamlyn
family of the disgrace of their deceased parent, regarded
the interment of his remains. When the widow was re-
ferred to concerning the spot selected in his life-time by
Mr. Hamlyn for his last resting-place, Walter and Henry
eagerly forestalled her answer, by naming the family-vault
at Ovington, which contained the ashes of their grand-
father.
“I should, however, advise," was Andrew Harrington's
remark on this suggestion, “ that he were buried quietly
in town. Under the sad circumstances of the case,
the
less observation provoked, the better. If you abide by
my opinion, you will consign your father to the grave, in
the most private manner, at Kensal Green. It would be
a grievous humiliation to all of you were any painful de-
monstration of public feeling to occur at the funeral.”
Mrs. Hamlyn was silent-Walter indignant-Henry

379
surprised. A memorandum in the handwriting of the
deceased, found shortly afterwards, having, however, ex-
pressly stipulated his place of interment by his father's
side, even the Harringtons, (who, much as they con-
demned the conduct of Hamlyn, admitted his filial piety
to have been remarkable,) coincided in Walter's desire
that his wishes should be respected.
Orders were accordingly issued for the opening of the
family-vault; and then it was the Hamlyns became first
aware of a heart-rending visitation consequent upon the
recent event in Lombard Street, which the kindly inter--
position of Colonel Hamilton had preserved from their
knowledge. The amiable wife of the good Vicar, startled
into a premature confinement by the tidings, indiscreetly
communicated, of Mr. Hamlyn's death and bankruptcy,
had fallen a sacrifice to the shock of knowing the inherit-
ance of her children, and the savings of her poor, to be
involved in the common ruin. On the second day, fever
had come on; and in the height of her delirium, calling
upon the grasping banker to render back the widow's
mite, the orphan's pittance, the solace of the aged, the
bread of the hungry, which he had plundered to gild the
waste of his ostentation, the exemplary protectress of
Ovington had given up the ghost!
In order to suspend the letter addressed by Walter to
Dr. Markham concerning the burial of him who had been
the means of laying his wife in the grave, Mrs. Hamilton
judged it indispensable to communicate this mournful
intelligence.
Still, the hearts of the young men were too full of
their father and his last wishes, not to persevere. They
addressed themselves to Jacob Durdan, as churchwarden
of the parish, instead of the afflicted vicar; and his
answer was directed to his respected neighbour, Colonel
Hamilton, not to the children of him whom he regarded
as little better than a thief.
“If I might make so bold, your honour," wrote the
farmer, who had given practical proof that he, at least,
understood the meaning of the word honesty,-"I would
ask you to recommend the family at Dean Park (whom
I should think little enough on, if they hadn't the luck

to call you friend) not by no means to think of bringing
down the body of the late Mr. Hamlyn, to Ovington
church. I wouldn't answer for the consequence, sir! I
wouldn't answer for what insults might be offered to the
corpse. We're decent folks hereabouts, your honour,
and no ways given to disrespect the dead. But I believe,
as I'm a Christian man, that the coffin would be torn to
pieces by the populace! It isn't only, sir, for the Savings'
Banks, and Loan Societies, and Benefit Societies, as he
robbed so shamefully, or the poor firesides he deprived of
their hope and comfort, by carrying off the little they'd
scraped together by the labour of a long life.—It isn't
only that, sir! But your honour knows how the Vicar
be respected among us, and what Madam Markham was
to the poor folk hereabouts. And after seeing that dear
lady carried to her grave, sir, with the coffin of her inno-
cent babe by her side, and not a dry eye in the parish
from the thought that 'twas the ruin of her poor children
that cut short her useful days,-after that, your honour,
to see that swindling hypocrite brought down among
us with all the pomp of mourning coaches and black
feathers, would be apt to exasperate the villagers beyond
what's safe.
“I humbly hope, Colonel, you won't attribute this
letter to any anger because of my being put to the cost
of deeds, to no purpose in the world, for the sale of my
farm. Only if you'd be pleased, sir, to apprise the young
gentlemen, (again whom nobody bears an ill-will for
what's no fault of their'n,) you'd do 'em a real sarvice,
and a kindness to your most humble servant to command,
.“ JACOB DURDAN."
Such was the first intimation to the young Hamlyns
of the abhorrence in which the memory of their father
was likely to be held. The lesson was a hard one; but
there is no rebelling against such instruction. Already,
the proud spirit of Walter was broken by the humilia-
tions arising out of the recent events; and when he
returned from laying the head of his father in an obscure
corner of one of the metropolitan cemeteries, and saw his
mother and sisters profit by the dusk of evening to quit

for ever the gorgeous mansion, the remote origin of so
much of their present misery, he felt that the glory of
his days had departed.-The hateful position in which
Alberic Vernon stood towards him, rendered every tender
feeling connected with that family a source of bitterness.
He had no consolations-no, not one!-His trust had
been in the world-his delight in its pomps and vanities.
Out of the vortex of London life, he had never framed a
wish, or indulged an ambition. And what was to be-
come of him, now that society was closed against him,
-the giddy pleasures of vanity suppressed,--the aspiring
hopes of vaulting ambition blighted for ever?-
If
upon Henry the blow had fallen with a less wither-
ing influence, it was because the weight was lessened by
the participation of an affectionate heart, and the wound
unenvenomed by the ill-blood of selfish vanity. Henry
Hamlyn was deeply humiliated by discoveries which
darkened the memory he would have delighted to honour.
But in his view of his father's delinquency, some portion
of the crime was chargeable upon the vices of our social
system.
“But for the idle emulation of my grandfather with
Lord Vernon, arising out of an indefinite state of society
and confusion of classes,” argued he, "my father would
have remained a thrifty, frugal, laborious man of business.
To my father, the old man bequeathed the choice be-
tween exposing his prodigality, or keeping up the farce
of pretended opulence and competition with the great;
and the vile task of dissimulation once accepted, he soon
lost all sense of moral obligation. And how excitingly
did the cheers of society and fawning of interested de-
pendents stimulate his progress! Who cared to examine
the sources of the wealth that conduced to their pleasures
or ministered to their advantage ?–Moreover, and above
all, if his command of money were acquired by dishonest
means, his application of it was not wholly unworthy.
If he took from the poor, he gave to the poor. His
charities were boundless,-his acts of generosity exem-
plary. But, alas ! alas !" was again and again the con-
cluding reflection of the sorrowing young man,—" that I
should be forced to have recourse to sophistry, to palliate

the wrong-doing of my once-loved, once-respected father!
-How short a time ago, would it have been accounted,
from one end of the city to the other, a vile calumny
to attribute so much as an error of judgment to Hamlyn
the banker!"
CHAPTER XXV.
“Close up his eyes-for we are sinners all !"-SAAKSPEARE.
Among those who suffered most, and with most self-
command, throughout these sad reverses, was Colonel
Hamilton. Unblinded, like the young Hamlyns, by the
instincts of nature, in his appreciation of the conduct of
him who was gone, he experienced the embitterment of
feeling naturally arising from consciousness of being
duped by those in whom we have placed the trust of
friendship. A great gap, moreover, was created in his
existence. He had lost his counsellor,—his hand-in-
hand companion,-his friend,—and without even the
solace of bestowing a regret on his memory!
His sentiments, however, were on this as on every
other occasion, characterized by tenderness and gene-
rosity. He lamented the loss of fortune chiefly as the
diminution of his means of contributing to the happiness
of his fellow-creatures; and instead of bewailing himself,
after Lord Vernon's fashion, as the most ill-used of man-
kind in being thus treacherously stripped of the major
part of a fortune which he had been toiling his life long,
in banishment and self-denial, to scrape together, he was
never weary of thanking Heaven for the interposition
which had detained so large a portion of his funds in
India till the day of peril was over; and led him to invest
a lesser one in purchasing the freehold in Portland Place.
Consider, my dearest Nelly,” said he to his daughter-
in-law, "that, had that fatal question been brought before
parliament only three weeks later, the consignment from
the Parsee Company would have fallen into Hamlyn's
hands, and been swallowed up with the rest! We should

have been reduced to absolute beggary, - the poor
Johnstons and all !—I could have made my way back to
Ghazerapore, and found welcome and work from my old
Rajah ;-and my bones might have been laid beside
poor Mary's.— Pincher and I don't want for much
in this world, and sha'n't want even that, much longer.
But
you, my poor dear child, whom I've taken so much
pride and pleasure in filling with hopes of being pros-
perous and happy, you wouldn't have borne Indy, Nelly!
-For all you're so fond of the warmth of Italy, you
coudn't have stood the climate of Ghazerapore. And
even if
you could, think what 'twould have been to Harry,
poor fellow, to find you brought to such misery, and
know it was occasioned by the iniquity of his father!
So you see, my dear, 'twas Heaven's own mercy that
Moonjee and Co. were so slow in fulfilling their engage-
ments ! "
Poor Ellen submitted to congratulate him, as he seemed
to desire, on the loss of his two hundred thousand pounds;
secretly blessing the ’tis-well-it's-no-worse philosophy
which so thoroughly reconciled him to a stroke of ad-
versity that would not only have driven any other man
to despair, but perhaps tempted him to visit upon the
son the crime of the sire !
“ 'Twould be sinful, my dear,” he added, “were we to
repine, so well off as we are, when others are suffering
so much more severely. There's poor Miss Creswell,
who'd been looking forward to comfort and competence,
left without a shilling ;-life to begin again, just as she
had earned the privilege of rest. There's that worthy
Dr. Grantham, (Quiddle was telling us of yesterday,)
with his large family of children, and his paralytic stroke.
There's that wretched widow-woman, who got hold of
me by the arm the day I was coming away from Lombard
Street with Harry, and talked about Hamlyn's obliga-
tions to her poor dear dead and gone John Darley,
and that she should be turned out of Lemon-Tree Yard,
where she'd bided for forty years. There's Sir Robert
Maitland, whom I betrayed into the scrape ;-and, above
all, there's poor, dear Markham, so broken-hearted, yet
resigned; with the children crying round his knees for

their mother, who, were he to die to-morrow, would
maybe be crying for bread !-As to those poor souls at
Ovington,-oh! Nelly, Nelly!—the more I think on't
all, the more I feel that I cannot be sufficiently grateful
to Providence for such a mitigation of my lot, and the
power of yielding them assistance !"
Another
person
who drank with submission the bitter
lees of the chalice of humiliation, was the banker's widow.
In the comfort afforded by the aid extended to her chil-
dren by the brothers who, through life, had held apart
from her husband, and in the unaltered affection of
young Dartford for her beloved daughter, she found un-
looked-for alleviations.
From the first hour of their tribulation, she perceived,
by the care with which on all occasions the Marquis
chose to identify himself with Walter and Henry in their
filial endeavours, that his intentions were unchanged.
And when, at the close of a month's mourning, he pressed,
under the sanction of his whole family, for her consent
to an immediate marriage, Mrs. Hamlyn indulged in
pious gratitude to Heaven for the destiny thus provided
for her daughter, without a single grovelling idea or self-
degradation. Grateful for the generosity of Dartford's
conduct, she felt that it could meet with no richer reward
than the affection of such a heart as Lydia's; and, in
according the credit due to the young lover, did equal
justice to the merits of her child.
It was from the house of her worthy uncle that Lydia
went forth, laying aside only for a few hours her mourn-
ing attire, to become the bride of one of the first nobles
in the realm. In scarcely any other spot would she have
found courage to leave her mother. But the house of
Andrew Harrington was one in which Mrs. Hamlyn
could abide without a painful sense of dependence. He
was a widower. His only child, a daughter some years
younger than Harriet, not only adored her cousins, but
was eminently benefited by Miss Creswell's sojourn
under her father's roof; and towards his sister, the blunt
merchant was tenderly scrupulous in mollifying his de-
portment. And if Walter had no severer Mentor, he had
also not a truer friend than his uncle Andrew.

“For that young man, Sophy,” he would sometimes
say to his sister, “ all that has happened is for the best.
The break-up was just in time. He was not quite
spoiled; and has learned the value of worldly friendships
and the hollowness of fashionable life. A few more years
to take the nonsense out of him, and I don't desire
better than to have him for a son-in-law. Little Sophy
will take a couple of hundred thousands or so, to the
man who chooses to call himself Harrington for her sake;
and it will be your own fault, my
dear sister, if you do
not, in the interim, make my poor neglected girl all you
can wish in a daughter-in-law
To Ellen and Colonel Hamilton, meanwhile, the first
removal from town to Burlington Manor was a severe
effort. He had scarcely courage to pass the lodge-
gates of Dean Park; and almost as little to survey from
his library-windows the Braxham Woods overhanging
The Hyde.
“Painful as it all is, my dear,” said he, with tears in
his
eyes, “it is my duty to be here. The place is mine
for the next twenty year ;-and if I don't abide in't, who
will ?—I can't keep up the place in the style I intended;
but we may live here decently, Nelly, and pay our way.
For you see, Ovington has lost everything in Dean Park;
to say nothing of poor dear Madam Markham, who'lí
never find a substitute while the world stands. So if
you and I absent ourselves, and the village loses the
profit of the Manor, in addition to all the rest, we should
have much to answer for !"
It sometimes puzzled the good Colonel to determine
how matters could be arranged when the period arrived
for Henry, who was completing his studies at Cambridge
in compliance with the desire of his uncles, to fulfil his
engagements with the "beautiful Ellen," in compliance
with his own. For, with all Mrs. Hamilton's affection
for her untrustworthy father-in-law, she persisted in her
bad habit of keeping her little love-affairs a secret from
him ;-- and had never afforded him a hint that the
Ormeau interest was to procure him a Colonial appoint-
ment, or that she and Harry had agreed to spend the
first two months after taking his degree, under the roof

of his kind mother, who had taken the stump of myrtle
under her protection, and placed a bracket in Andrew
Hamilton's drawing-room to support Gibson's bust of
Diana.
The most painful trial that awaited both Ellen and the
good Colonel, on their return into Warwickshire, was
their first interview with the Vicar. Mortifications, they
bore without wincing. The impertinence of Barlow of
Alderham, who forced himself upon them in a morning
visit, for the purpose of reminding them that the man by
whom the county had been disgraced and the funds of its
Hospital and Lunatic Asylum plundered, did not belong
to one of “ the old county families," was a thing to smile
at; and the exultation of Gratwycke of Gratwycke that,
henceforth, his donations to the Warwickshire Charities
would be first in magnitude on the list, a thing for Chris-
tian pity. But it was a severe ordeal to walk through the
village, --whose Almshouses and Infirmary were now shut
up, whose rags had been taxed and whose barley-loaves
rendered scant, to swell the profusion of the impostor who
had so long pretended to act as its benefactor,—to the
Vicarage, whose household altar that hollow-hearted
guest of princes and haranguer of senates, had levelled
with the dust!
“I wish to Heaven above the meeting was over, Nelly!"
faltered the Colonel, as they entered the little garden, now
weedy and disordered. “I can't bear the thoughts of
seeing her chair empty, and those poor little ones in their
black frocks.- Well! she's in a better place !—If any one
can be sure of salvation, 'tis such a meek, self-denying soul
as she was.—Nelly! I wish the meeting was over!"
It was a relief to the old gentleman to find that Dr.
Markham had stepped across the fields to Durdan's farm.
But Ellen, aware how much it had cost them both to
prepare for entering the house, was resolved that the
effort should not be lost.—She had some little
her pocket which she had brought from town for the
children; and after asking to have them brought into the
parlour, walked firmly in.
As the Colonel had foretold, it was sad work to look
upon the vacant chair and formal, tidy room, in com-
presents in

parison with the litter of the old work-table, on which
clothes for the poor were always in progress, or the
children's dog’s-eared spelling-books lying about. Ellen
would have given much to have seen on the carpet a skein
of silk or ball of cotton !-
Nor were her feelings much relieved when little Kitty
made her appearance-hiding her now shy face; led in by
the nurse, too happy in having a new visitor to whom she
could relate the oft-told tale of her poor dear angel of a
dead-and-gone mistress's sufferings, and how, if there
was a God in heaven, Hamlyn, the banker, was doomed
to eternal punishment !
“She never held up her head after the news, ma'am !”
said she, while the Colonel turned away to the window,
to conceal his emotion. “The poor babe, ma'am,
was still-born ;-never stirred, the Doctor said, from
the moment of its poor mother's hearing of Squire
Hamlyn's having made away with himself.--- And at last,
ma'am, when the fever com’on, to hear how the poor
dear soul kept talking of the ruined families in the vil-
lage, one by one ;-how poor old Parsons would have no
coals or blankets this winter for his rheumatis,--and
what the carpenter's orphans would do,—and such like.-
And then, bursting out a-singing, all as one as she was in
the organ-loft. Never did her poor voice sound finer nor
more sweet than only half an hour before she died; and
master's hand in her's, begging her to compose herself,
and not sing so. And she laughing outright, and then, a
prayer, and then, flying off to Mary Haines, the poor
oman as went up from vington to the county hospital;
-and at last, another hymn, as clear and sweet as a
nightingale !- Everybody present said 'twas the song of
angels !"
“She is an angel, Mrs. Smith !" cried the Colonel,
turning abruptly round; an angel with God!”—
And the poor nurse sobbed only the louder for that
“ If you'd heard the poor dear children a-calling
after their mamma, sir, those first two or three days!"
said she; “ I'm sure I thought poor master would ha’

TIIE BANKER'S WIFE;
but me.
Look here !" continued the good woman, opening the
door of a little vestibule that led to the Vicarage-garden,
and pointing to a bonnet and shawl hanging up, which
Ellen recognised from having hundreds of times met
poor Mrs. Markham arrayed in them, when fulfilling
her errands of charity in the village. “Master won't
hear of these being took down, ma'am, though it goes
to everybody's heart to see 'em. I got up betimes one
morning, afore he was astir, and moved 'em, and thought
he'd never miss 'em. Bless you, as he came through
the hall to read morning-prayers, he saw at a glance
they was gone, and know'd nobody'd dare to touch 'em
Smith !' said he, let those things be instantly
replaced ! And them as ever heard master speak in
that tone, sir, know there's to be no reply. So I went
and fetched 'em, with tears in my eyes. And ever since,
ma'am, I've noticed that when poor folks out of the village
comes to ask for assistance, and since Hamlyn's failure,
master's obliged to think twice about granting it, where
he didn't used to think once !) the first thing he does is
to glance up at that poor shawl and bonnet; as much
as to say, If she was still here, my poor people, you
wouldn't have been forced to ask for help!-But God's
will be done!”
At the close of this mournful narrative, Ellen, who was
petting poor little Kitty upon her knee, found that her
own tears were stealing down the little white shoulder
of the child; who, left wholly to servants, seemed
frightened rather than pleased by the endearments of
a lady who was not mamma!”
At that moment, the Vicar passed the window, and
entered the room to welcome his guests. Though thin,
haggard, and pale, he made an effort to meet them with
a smile; that he might not be the only one unable to
adopt his prescribed submission of God's will be
done!"
But the poor child allowed him no time for his intended.
welcome. Extending her little arms towards him, as
though she had at last found a friend, she exclaimed,
with imperfect utterance-
“ Take me home, dear papa,
I want to go home,- I want to go home !"-

“You are at home, my darling. Hush, hush!-you
are at home,” whispered the poor father, pressing her
to his heart..
"No, no! Kitty wants to go home!” reiterated the
child, in a plaintive, piteous voice. And though that
mournful cry was unintelligible to the Hamiltons, it
wrung the heart of the poor Vicar, who, on the day of
his wife's funeral, ere the stone was rolled to the door of
the sepulchre, had been rash enough to take his infant in
his arms, and, accompanied by his sobbing boys, show them
the last resting-place of their mother; so that, in after-
life, they might know how her coffin had been scattered
over with herbs by the hands of the
poor
whom
she had comforted—the poor whom she had fed—a tri-

wherewith the forms of the church symbolically degrade

But the impression of this spectacle on the younger
child had been most injurious. The tender infant, accus-

THE BANKER'S WIFE.
That good“old Jack Hamilton” should have forgiven
and forgotten the offences of Richard Hamlyn, by which

CITY,-are beginning to overlook the delinquencies of
the fraudulent Banker, in tribute to the patient virtues
of the BANKER'S WIFE.
