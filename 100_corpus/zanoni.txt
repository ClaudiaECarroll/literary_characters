TO
JOHN GIBSON, R.A.,
SCULPTOR.
IN looking round the wide and luminous circle of
our great living Englishmen, to select one to whom
I might ﬁtly dedicate this work,—one who, in his
life as in his genius, might illustrate the principle I
have sought to convey; —elevated by the ideal
which he exalts, and serenely dwelling in a glorious
existence with the images born of his imagination,—
in looking round for some such man, my tnou hts
rested upon you. Afar from our turbulent cab s—
from the ignoble jealousy and the sordid strife which
degrade and acerbate the ambition of Genius,-in .
your Roman Home, you have lived amidst all that is
loveliest and least perishable in the Past, and con-
tributed with the noblest aims, and in the purest
spirit, to the mighty heirlooms of the Future. ' Your
7 youth has been devoted to toil, that your manhood
may be consecrated to fame; -—a fame unsullied by
one desire of gold. You have escaped the two worst
1* (v)

perils that beset the Artist in our time and land--
the debasing tendencies of Commerce, and the angry
rivalries of Competition. You have not wrought
your marble for the market—you have not been
tempted, by the praises which our vicious criticism
has showered upon exaggeration and distortion, to
lower your taste to the level of the Hour; you have
lived, and you have labored, as if you had no rivals,
but in the Dead—n0 purchasers, save in judges of
what is best. In the divine Priesthood of the Beauti-
ful, you have sought only to increase her worshippers
and enrich her temples. The pupil of Canova, you
have inherited his excellences, while you have shunned
his errors : —yours his delicacy, not his affectation.
Your heart resembles him even more than your
genius—you have the same noble enthusiasm for
your sublime profession—the same lofty freedom
from envy, and the spirit that depreciates—the same
generous desire, not to war with, but to serve, Artists
’ in your art; aiding, strengthening, advising, elevating
the timidity of inexperience, and the vague aspira-
tions of youth. By the intuition of a kindred mind,
you have equalled the learning of Winckelman, and
the plastic poetry of Goethe, in the intimate compre-
hension of the Antique. Each work of yours, rightly
studied, is in itself a criticism, illustrating the sub-
lime secrets of tne Grecian Art, which, without the

servility of plagiarism, you have contributed to re-
vive amongst us; in you we behold its three great
and long undetected principles,-—simplicity, calm,
and concentration.
But your admiration of the Greeks has not led you
to the bigotry of the mere Antiquarian, nor made
you less sensible of the unappreciated excellence of
the mighty Modern, worthy to be your countryman,
-—th0ugh till his statue is in the streets of our
capital, we show ourselves not worthy of the glory
he has shed upon our land: You have not suffered
even your gratitude to Canova to blind you to the
superiority of Flaxman. When we become sensible
of our title-deeds to renown in that single name, we
may look for an English public capable of real patron-
age to English Art,— and not till then.
I, Artist in words, dedicate, then, to you, Artist,
whose ideas speak in marble, this well-loved work of
my matured manhood. I love it not the less because
it has been little understood and superﬁcially judged
by the common herd: it was not meant for them. I
love it not the more because it has found enthusiastic
favorers amongst the Few. My aﬂ'ection for my
work is rooted in the solemn and pure delight which
it gave me to conceive and to perform. If I had
graven it on the rocks of a desert, this apparition of
my own innermost mind, in its least clouded moments,

would have been to me as dear: And this ought, I
believe, to be the sentiment with which he whose Art
is born of faith in the truth and beauty of the princi-
ples he seeks to illustrate, should regard his work.
Your serener existence, uniform and holy, my lot
denies—if my heart covets. But our true nature is
in our thoughts, not our deeds: And therefore, in
Books—which are his Thoughts—the Author’s
character lies bare to the discerning eye. It is not
in the life of cities—in the turmoil and the crowd;
it is in the still, the lonely, and more sacred life,
which for some hours, under every sun, the student
lives—(his stolen retreat from the Agora to the
Cave), that I feel there is between us the bond of
that secret sympathy, that magnetic chain —which
unites the Everlasting Brotherhood, of whose being
Zanoni is the type.

INTRODUCTION.
IT is possible that, among my readers, there may
be a few not unacquainted with an old book-shop,
existing some years since in the neighborhood of
Covent Garden ; I say a few, for certainly there was
little enough to attract the .many, in those precious
volumes which the labor of a' life had accumulated on .
the dusty shelves of my old friend D There
were to be found no popular treatises, no entertaining
romances, no histories, no travels, no “Library for
the People,” no “ Amusement for the Million." But
there, perhaps, throughout all Europe, the curious
might discover the most notable collection, ever
amassed by an enthusiast, of the works of Alchemist,
Cabalist, and Astrologer. The owner had lavished a
fortune in the purchase of unsaleable treasures. But
01d D— did not desire to sell. It absolutely went
to his heart when a customer entered his shop; he
watched the movements of the presumptuous intruder
with a vindictive glare, he ﬂuttered around him with
uneasy vigilance; he frowned, he groaned, when
profane hands dislodged his idols from their niches.

harem that attracted you, and the price named were
not sufﬁciently enormous, he would not unfrequently
double the sum. Demur, and in brisk delight he
snatched the venerable charmer from your hands;
accede, and he became the picture of despair : -—Nor
unfrequently, at the dead of night, would he knock
at your door, and entreat you to sell him back, at
your own terms, what you had so egregiously bought
at his. A believer himself in his Averroes and Para-
celsus, he was as 10th as the philosophers he studied
to communicate to the profane the learning he had
collected.
It so chanced that some years ago, in my younger
days, whether of authorship or life, I felt a desire to
make myself acquainted with the true origin and
tenets of the singular sect known by the name of
Rosicrucians. Dissatisﬁed with the scanty and super-
ﬁcial accounts to be found in the works usually re-
ferred to on the subject, it struck me as possible that
Mr. D ’s collection, which was rich, not only in
black-letter, but in manuscripts, might contain some
more accurate and authentic records of that famous
brotherhood—written, who knows? by one of their
own order, and conﬁrming by authority and detail
the pretensions to wisdom and to virtue which Brin-
garet had arrogated to the successors of the Chaldean
and Gymnosophist. Accordingly I repaired to what,
doubtless, I ought to be ashamed to confess, was once
one of my favorite haunts. But are there no errors
and no fallacies, in the chronicles of our own day, as
absurd as those of the alchemists of old ? Our very
newspapers may seem to our posterity as full of delu-

INTRODUCTION. 31
moms as the books of the alchemists do to us ;—not but
what the Press is the air we breathe—and uncom-
monly foggy the air is too!
On entering the shop, I was struck by the venera-
ble appearance of a customer whom I had never seen
there before. I was struck yet more by the respect
with which he was treated by the disdainful collector.
“Sir,” cried the last, emphatically, as I was turning
over the leaves of the catalogue— “Sir, you are the
only man I have met in ﬁve-and-forty years that I
have spent in these researches, who is worthy to be
my customer. How—where, in this frivolous age,
could you have acquired a knowledge so profound?
And this august fraternity, whose doctrines, hinted
at by the earliest philosophers, are still a mystery to
the latest; tell me if there really exists upon the
earth, any book, any manuscript, in which their dis-
coveries, their tenets, are to be learned?”
At the words “ august fraternity,” I need scarcely
say that my attention had been at once aroused, and.
I listened eagerly for the stranger’s reply.
“I do not think," said the old gentleman, “that
the masters of the school have ever consigned, except
by obscure hint and mystical parable, their real doc-
trines to the world. And I do not blame them for
their discretion."
Here he paused, and seemed about to retire, when
I said, somewhat abruptly, to the collector, “I see
nothing, Mr. D , in this catalogue, which relates
to the Rosicrucians!"
“The Bosicrucians l ” repeated the old gentleman,
and in his turn be surveyed me with deliberate sur-

prise. “Who but a Rosicrucian could explain the
Rosicrucian mysteries! And can you imagine that
any members of that sect, the most jealous of all
secret societies, would themselves lift the veil that
hides the Isis of their wisdom from the world?"
“Aha!” thought I, “this, then, is ‘the august
fraternity] of which you spoke. Heaven be praised !
I certainly have stumbled on one of the brotherhood."
“ But," I said, aloud, “ if not in books, sir, where
else am I to obtain information? Nowadays one can
hazard nothing in print without authority, and one
may scarcely quote Shakspeare without citing chap-
ter and verse. This is the age of facts—the age of
facts, sir."
“ Well," said the old gentleman, with a pleasant
smile, “if we meet again, perhaps, at least, I may
direct your researches to the proper source of intelli-
gence." And with that he buttoned his great-coat,
whistled to his dog, and departed.
It so happened that I did meet again with the old
gentleman, exactly four days after our brief conver-
sation in Mr. Dé’s book-shop. I was riding
leisurely towards Highgate, when, at the foot of its
classic hill, I recognized the stranger ; he was mounted
on a black pony, and before him trotted his dog,
which was black also.
If you meet the man whom you wish to know, on
horseback, at the commencement of a long hill, where,
unless he has borrowed a friend’s favorite hack, he
cannot, in decent humanity to the brute creation,
ride away from you, I apprehend that it is your own
' fault if you have not gone far in your object before

INTRODUCTION. xiii
you have gained the top. In short, so well did I
succeed, that on reaching Highgate, the old gentle-
man invited me to rest at his house, which was a
little apart from the village; and an excellent house
it was —small, but commodious, with a large garden,
and commanding from the windows such a prospect
as Lucretius would recommend to philosophers:—
the spires and domes of London, on a clear day,
distinctly visible; here the Retreat of the Hermit,
and there the Mare Magnum of the world.
The walls of the principal rooms were embellished
with pictures of extraordinary merit, and in that
high school of art which is so little understood out
of Italy. I was surprised to learn that they were all
from the hand of the owner. My evident admiration
pleased my new friend, and led to talk upon his part,
which showed him no less elevated in his theories of
art than an adept in the practice. Without fatiguing
the reader with irrelevant criticism, it is necessary,
perhaps, as elucidating much of the design and
character of the work which these prefatory pages
introduce, that I should brieﬂy observe, that he
insisted as much upon the Connection of the Arts, as
a distinguished author had upon that of the Sciences ;
that he held that in all works of imagination, whether
expressed by words or by colors, the artist of the
higher schools must make the broadest distinction
between the Real and the True,——in other words,
between the imitation of actual life, and the exalta-,
tion of Nature into the Ideal.
“The one,” said he, “is the Dutch School, the
other is the Greek.” .
I. -— 2


## p. xiv (#22) #############################################

xiv INTRODUCTION.
“ Sir," said I, “the Dutch is the most in fashion."
“Yes, in painting, perhaps,” answered my host,
“but in literature "
“ It was of literature I spoke. Our growmg, poets
are all for simplicity and Betty Foy; and our critics
hold it the highest praise of a work of imagination,
to say that its characters are exact to common life.
Even in sculpture "
“In sculpture! No—nol there the high ideal
must at least be essential ! "V
“ Pardon me; I fear you have not seen Souter
Johnny and Tam O’Shanter.”
“ Ah! " said the old gentleman, shaking his head,
“I live very much out of the world, I see. I sup-
pose Shakspeare has ceased to be admired?”
“ On the contrary; people make the adoration of
Shakspeare the excuse for attacking everybody else.
But then our critics have discovered that Shakspeare
is so real!"
“Real! The poet who has never once drawn a
character to be met within actual life—who has
never once descended to a passion that is false, or a
personage who is real!”
I was about to reply very severely to this paradox, 1
when I perceived that my companion was growing a
little out of temper. And he who wishes to catch a
Rosicrucian, must take care not to disturb the
waters. —I thought it better, therefore, to turn the
conversation.
“Revenons (1‘ nos moutons," said I; “ you prom-
ised to enlighten my ignorance as to the Rosicru-
cians."




## p. xv (#23) ##############################################

INTRODUCTION. XV
“ Well!" quoth he, rather sternly, “ but for what
purpose? Perhaps you desire only to enter the term
ple in order to ridicule the rites?"
“What do you take me for! Surely, were I so
inclined, the fate of the Abbé de Villars is a suﬂicient
warning to all men not to treat idly of the realms of
the Salamander and the Sylph. Everybody knows
how mysteriously that ingenious personage was de—
prived of his life, in revenge for the witty mockeries
of his Comte de Gabalis.”
“Salamander and Sylph! I see that you fall into
the vulgar error, and translate literally the allegori—
cal language of the mystics."
With that the old gentleman condescended to enter
into a very interesting, and, as it seemed to me, a
very erudite relation, of the tenets of the Rosicru-
cians, some of whom, he asserted, still existed, and
still prosecuted, in august secrecy, their profound
researches into natural science and occult philosophy.
“ But this fraternity," said he, “ however respect-
able and virtuous—virtuous I say, for no monastic-
order is more severe in the practice of moral precepts,
or more ardent in Christian faith—this fraternity is
but a branch of others yet more transcendent in the
powers they have obtained, and yet more illustrious
in their origin. Are you acquainted with the Plato-
nists ? "
“I have occasionally lost my way in their laby-
rinth," said I. “ Faith, they are rather difﬁcult
gentlemen to understand."
“ Yet their knottiest problems have never yet been

published. Their sublimest works are in manuscript,
and constitute the initiatory learning, not only of the
Bosicrucians, but of the nobler brotherhoods I have
referred to. More solemn and sublime still is the
knowledge to be gleaned from the elder Pythagoreans,
and the immortal master-pieces of Apollonius."
“Apollonius the impostor of Tyaneal are his writ-
ings extant ? "
“ Impostor !" cried my host; “Apollonius an im-
postor l "
“ I beg your pardon; I did not know he was a
friend of yours; and if you vouch for his character,
I will believe him to have been a very respectable
man, who only spoke the truth when he boasted of
his power to be in two places at the same time."
“ Is that so difﬁcult ? ” said the old gentleman ; “if
so, you have never dreamed I " "
Here ended our conversation ; but from that time
an acquaintance was formed between us, which lasted
till my venerable friend departed this life. Peace to
his ashes! He was a person of singular habits and
eccentric opinions; but the chief part of his time was
occupied in acts of quiet and unostentatious goodness.
He was an enthusiast in the duties of the Samaritan;
and as his virtues were softened by the gentlest
charity, so his hopes were based upon the devoutest
belief. He never conversed upon his own origin and
history, nor have I ever been able to penetrate the
darkness in which they were concealed. He seemed
to have seen much of the world, and to have been an
eye-witness of the ﬁrst French Revolution, a subject

upon which he was equally eloquent and instructive.
At the same time, he did not regard the crimes of
that stormy period with the philosophical leniency
with which enlightened writers (their heads safe upon
their shoulders) are, in the present day, inclined to
treat the massacres of the past: he spoke not as a
student who had read and reasoned, but as a man
who had seen and suffered. The old gentleman
seemed alone in the world; nor did I know that he
had one relation, till his executor, a distant cousin,
residing abroad, informed me of the very handsome
legacy which my poor friend had bequeathed me.
This consisted ﬁrst of a sum about which I think it
best to be guarded, foreseeing the possibility of a new
tax upon real and funded property ; and secondly, of
certain precious manuscripts, to which the following
volumes owe their existence.
I imagine I trace this latter bequest to a visit I
paid the Sage, if so I may be permitted to call him,
a few weeks before his death.
Although he read little of our modern literature,
my friend, with the affable good-nature which be-
longed to him, graciously permitted me to consult
him upon various literary undertakings meditated
by the desultory ambition of a young and inexperi-
enced student. And at that time I sought his advice
upon a work of imagination, intended to depict the
effects of enthusiasm upon different modiﬁcations of
character. He listened to my conception, which was
sufﬁciently trite and prosaic, with his usual patience ;

took down an old volume, and read to me, ﬁrst in
Greek, and secondly in English, some extracts to the
following eﬂ‘ect :—
“ Plato here expresses four kinds of Mania, by
which I desire to understand enthusiasm and the in-
spiration of the gods—Firstly, the musical; secondly,
the telestic or mystic; thirdly, the prophetic; and
fourthly, that which belongs to Love.”
The Author he quoted, after contending that there
is something in the soul above intellect, and stating
that there are in our nature distinct energies, by the
one of which we discover and seize as it were on
sciences and theorems with almost intuitive rapidity,~.
by another, through which high art is accomplished,
like the statues of Phidias, proceeded to state, that
“enthusiasm, in the true acceptation of the word, is,
when that part of the soul which is above intellect
is excited to the gods, and thence derives its inspi-
ration."
The Author then pursuing his comment upon
Plato, observes, that “ one of these manias may sufﬁce
(especially that which belongs to Love) to lead back
the soul to its ﬁrst divinity and happiness; but that
there is an intimate union with them all; and that
the ordinary progress through which the soul ascends
is, primarily, through the musical; next, through the
telestic or mystic; thirdly, through the prophetic;
and lastly, through the enthusiasm of Love."
While with a bewildered understanding and a re-
luctant attention, I listened to these intricate sub-
.imities, my adviser closed the volume, and said with

complacency, “There is the motto for your book-—
the thesis for your theme.”
“Davus sum, non @dipus,” said I, shaking my
head, discontentedly. “All this may be exceedingly
' ﬁne, but Heaven forgive me—I don’t understand a
word of it. The mysteries of your Rosicrucians, and
your fraternities, are mere child’s play to the jargon
of the Platonists."
“ Yet, not till you rightly understand this passage,
can you understand the higher theories of the Rosi-
crucians, or of the still nobler fraternities you speak
of with so much levity.”
“Oh, if that be the case, I give up in despair.
Why not, since you are so well versed in the matter,
take the motto for a book of your own?"
“But if I have already composed a book with that
thesis for its theme, will you prepare it for the public ? "
“With the greatest pleasure,” said I,—alas, too
rashlyl
“I shall hold you to your promise,” returned the
old gentleman, “and when I am no more, you will
receive the manuscripts. From what you say of the
prevailing taste in literature, I cannot ﬂatter you
with the hope that you will gain much by the under-
taking. And I tell you beforehand that you will ﬁnd
it not a little laborious."
“ Is your work a romance?"
“It is a romance, and it is not a romance. It is a
truth for those who can comprehend it, and an er-
travagance fzr those who cannot.”

patience, I opened the packet and trimmed my lamp.

I began to think the lamp burned singularly blue;
and sundry misgivings as to the unhallowed nature
of the characters I had so unwittingly opened upon,
coupled with the strange hints and mystical language
of the old gentleman, crept through my disordered
imagination. Certainly, to say no worse of it, the
whole thing looked uncanny! I was about, precipi-
tately, to hurry the papers into my desk, with a pious
determination to have nothing more to do with them,
’when my eye fell upon a book, neatly bound in blue
morocco, and which, in my eagerness, I had hitherto
overlooked. I opened this volume with great pre-
caution, not knowing what might jump out, and—
guess my delight—found that it contained a key or
dictionary to the hieroglyphics. Not to weary the
reader with an account of my labors, I am contented
with saying that atlast I imagined myself capable

of construing the characters, and set to work in good
earnest. Still it was no easy task, and two years
elapsed before I had made much progress. I then,
by way of experiment on the public, obtained the in-
sertion of a few desultory chapters, in a periodical
with which, for a few months, I had the honor to be
connected. They appeared to excite more curiosity
than I had presumed to anticipate; and I renewed,
with better heart, my laborious undertaking. But
now a new misfortune befell me: I found as I pro—
ceeded, that the Author had made two copies of his
work, one much more elaborate and detailed than the
other: I had stumbled upon the earlier copy, and
had my whole task to re-model, and the chapters I
had written to re-translate. I may say then, that,
exclusive of intervals devoted to more pressing occu-
pations, my unlucky promise cost me the toil of several
years before I could bring it to adequate fulﬁlment.
The task was the more difﬁcult, since the style in the
original is written in a kind of rhythmical prose, as '
if the author desired that in some degree his work
should be regarded as one of poetical conception and
design. To this it was not possible to do justice, and
in the attempt, I have, doubtless, very often need of
the reader’s indulgent consideration. My natural
respect for the old gentleman’s vagaries, with a muse
of equivocal character, must be my only excuse when-
ever the language, without luxuriating into verse,
borrows ﬂowers scarcely natural to prose. Truth
compels me also to confess, that, with all my pains, I
am by no means sure that I have invariably given

the true meaning of the cipher; nay, that here and
there either a gap in the narrative, or the sudden
assumption of a new cipher, to which no key was
afforded, has obliged me to resort to interpolations of
my own, no doubt easily discernible, but which, I
ﬂatter myself, are not inharmonious to the general
design. This confession leads me to the sentence
with which I shall conclude—If, reader, in this book
there be anything that pleases you, it is certainly
mine; but whenever you come to something you dis-
like,—-lay the blame upon the old gentleman!

A'r Naples, in the latter half of the last century, a
worthy artist, named Gaetano Pisani, lived and ﬂourished.
He was a musician of great genius, but not of popular
reputation; there was in all his compositions something
capricious and fantastic, which did not please the taste
of the Dilettanti of Naples. He was fond of unfamiliar
subjects, into which he introduced airs and symphonies
that excited a kind of terror in those who listened. The
names of his pieces will probably suggest their nature.
I ﬁnd, for instance, among his MSS., these titles: “ The}
Feast of the Harpies,” “The Witches at Benevento,”

“ The Descent of Orpheus into Hades,” “The Evil Eye,”
“ The Eumenides,” and many others that evince a power-
ful imagination, delighting in the fearful and supernatural,
but often relieved, by an airy and delicate fancy, with
passages of exquisite grace and beauty. It is true that
in the selection of his subjects from ancient fable, Gaetano
Pisani was much more faithful than his contemporaries
to the remote origin and the early genius of Italian Opera.
That descendant, however eﬂeminate, of the ancient union
between Song and Drama, when, after long obscurity and
dethronement, it regained a pnnier sceptre, though a
gaudier purple, by the banks of the Etrurian Arno, or
amidst the Lagunes of Venice, had chosen all its primary
inspirations from the unfamiliar and classic sources of
heathen legend; and Pisani’s v“ Descent of Orpheus”
was but a holder, darker, and more scientiﬁc repetition
of the “ Euridice ” which Jacopi Peri set to music at the
august nuptials of Henry of Navarre and Mary of Medi-
cis.* Still, as I have said, the style of the Neapolitan
musician was not on the whole pleasing to cars grown
nice and euphuistic in the more dulcet melodies of the
day; and faults and extravagancies easily discernible,
and often to appearance wilful, served the critics for an
excuse for their distaste. Fortunately, or the poor musi-
cian might have starved, he was not only a composer,
but also an excellent practical performer, especially on

the violin, and by that instrument he earned a decent
subsistence as one of the orchestra at the Great Theatre
of San Carlo. Here, formal and appointed tasks neces-
sarily kept his eccentric fancies in tolerable check, though
it is recorded that no less than ﬁve times he had been
deposed from his desk for having shocked the conoscenti,
and thrown the whole band into confusion, by impromptu
variations of so frantic and startling a nature that one
might well have imagined that the harpies or witches who
inspired his coinpositions had clawed hold of his instru-
ment. The impossibility, however, to ﬁnd any one of _
equal excellence as a performer (that is to say, in his more
lucid and orderly moments), had forced his reinstalment,
and he had now, for the most part, reconciled himself to
the narrow sphere of his appointed adagios or allegros.
The audience, too, aware of his propensity, were quick
to perceive the least deviation from the text; and if he
wandered for a moment, which might also be detected by
the eye as well as the ear, in some strange contortion of
visage, and some ominous ﬂourish of-his how, a gentle
and admonitory murmur recalled the musician from his
Elysium or his Tartarus, to the sober regions of his desk.
Then he would start as if from a dream --cast a hurried,
frightened, apolegetic glance around, and, with a crest-
fallcn, humbled air, draw his rebellious instrument back
to the beaten track of the glib monotony. But at home
he would make himself amends for this reluctant drudgery.
And there, grasping the unhappy violin with ferocious
ﬁngers, he would pour forth, often till the morning rose,

strange wild measures, that would startle the early ﬁsher-
man on the shore below with a superstitious awe, and
make him cross himself as if mermaid or sprite had wailed
no earthly music in his car.
This man’s appearance was in keeping with the charac-
teristics of his art. The features were noble and striking,
but worn and haggard, with black, careless locks, tangled
into a maze of curls, and a ﬁxed, speculative, dreamy
stare in his large and hollow eyes. All his movements
were peculiar, sudden, and abrupt, as the ~impulse seized
him; and in gliding through the streets, or along the
'beach, he was heard laughing and talking to himself.
Withal, he was a harmless, guileless, “gentle creature, and
would share his mite with any idle lazzaroni, whom he
often paused to contemplate as they lay lazily basking in
the sun.‘ Yet was he thoroughly unsocial. He formed
0 friends, ﬂattered no patrons, resorted to none of the
merry-makings, so dear to the children of music and the
south. He and his art seemed alone suited to each other
- both quaint, primitive, unworldly, irregular. You could
not separate the man from his music; it was himself.

he was king over worlds of his own. Poor man, he had

Genius, to thy contempt for riches, will be thy perform-
ance on thy violinl
Gaetano Pisani’s talents as a composer had been chieﬂy
exhibited in music appropriate to this his favorite instru-
ment, of all, unquestionably, the most various and royal
in its resources and power over the passions. As Shak-
speare among poets, is the Cremona among instruments.
Nevertheless, he had composed other pieces, of larger
ambition and wider accomplishment, and, chief of these,
his precious — his unpurchased — his unpublished — his
unpublishable and imperishable opera of the “Siren.”
This great work had been the dream of his boyhood—the
mistress of his manhood; in advancing age "it stood
beside him like his youth.” Vainly had he struggled to
place it before the world. Even bland, unjealous Paisiello,
Maestro di Capella, shook his gentle head when the mu-
sician favored him with a specimen of one of his most
thrilling scenas. And yet, Paisiello, though that music
differs from all Durante taught thee to emulate, there
may—but patience, Gaetano Pisani !——bide thy time, and
keep thy violin in tune!
Strange as it may appear to the fairer reader, this gro-
tesque personage had yet formed those ties which ordinary
mortals are apt to consider their especial monopoly—he
was married, and had one child. What is more strange
yet, his wife was a daughter of quiet, sober, unfantastic
England; she was much younger than himself; she was
fair and gentle, with a sweet English face: she had mar-
ried him from choice, and (will you believe it 7) she yet

loved him. How she came to marry him, or how this say,
unsocial, wayward creature ever ventured to propose, I
can only explain by asking you to look round and explain
ﬁrst to me how half the husbands and half the wives you
meet ever found a mate 1 Yet, on reﬂection, this union
was not so extraordinary after all. The girl was a natu-
ral child of parents too noble ever to own and claim her.
She was brought into Italy to learn the art by which she
was to live, for she bad taste and voice; she was a de-
pendant, and harshly treated; and poor Pisani was her
master, and his voice the only one she had heard from
her cradle, that seemed without one tone that could scorn
0r ehide. - And so-well, is the rest natural ? Natural
or not, they married. This young wife loved her hus-
band; and young and gentle as she was, she might al-
most be said to be the protector of the two. From how
many disgraces with the despots of San Carlo and the
Conservatorio had her unknown ofﬁcions mediation saved
him! In how many ailments—for his frame was weak—-
had she nursed and tended him ! Often, in the dark nights,
she would wait at the theatre, with her lantern to light
him, and her steady arm to lean on ;—otherwise, in h
abstract reveries, who knows but the musician would have
walked after his “Siren” into the sea! And then she
would so patiently, perhaps (for in true love there is not
always the ﬁnest taste) so delightedly listen to those
storms of eccentric and ﬁtful melody, and steal him—
whispering praises all the way — from the unwholesome
night-watch to rest and sleep! I said his music was a

part of the man, and this gentle creature seemed a part
of the music; it was, in fact, when she sat beside him,
that whatever was tender or fairy-like in his motley fan-
tasia crept into the harmony as by stealth. Doubtless
her presence acted on the music, and shaped and softened
it; but he, who never examined how or what his inspi-
ration, knew it not. All that he knew was, that he loved
and blessed her. He fancied he told her so twenty times
a day; but he never did, for he was not of many words,
even to his wife. His language was his music, as hers—
her cares l He was more communicative to his barbiton,
as the learned Mersennus teaches us to call all the varie-
ties of the great viol family. Certainly barbiton sounds
better than ﬁddle; and barbiton let it be. He would
talk to that by the hour together—praise it—scold it—-
eoax it, nay (for such is man, even the most guileless),
he had been known to swear at it; but for that excess he
was always penitentially remorseful. And the barbiton
had a tongue of his own, could’take his own part, and
when he also scolded, had much the best of it. He was
a noble fellow, this Violin! a Tyrolese, the handiwork of
the illustrious Steiner. There was something mysterious
in his great age. How many hands, now dust, had awa-
kened his strings ere he became the Robin Goodfellow
and Familiar of Gaetano Pisanil His very case was
venerable; beautifully painted, it was said, by Caracci.
An English collector had offered more for the case than
Pisani had ever made by the violin. But Pisani, who

of a. palace for the barbiton. His barbiton, it was his
elder child! He had another child, and now we must
turn to her.
How shall I describe thee, Viola? Certainly the music
had something to answer for in the advent of that young
stranger. For both in her form and her character you
might have traced a family likeness to that singular and
spirit-like life of sound which night after night threw it-
self in airy and goblin sport over the starry seas. . . .Beau-
tiful she was, but of a very uncommon beauty—a combi-
nation, a harmony of opposite attributes. Her hair of a
gold richer and purer than that which is seen even in the
north; but the eyes, of all the dark, tender, subduing
light of more than Italian—almost of oriental—splendor.
The complexion exquisitely fair, but never the same-
vivid in one moment, pale the next'. And with the com-
plexion, the expression also varied; nothing now so sad,
and nothing new so joyous.
I grieve to say that what we rightly entitle education
was much neglected for their daughter by this singular
pair. To be sure, neither of them had much knowledge
to bestow; and knowledge was not then the fashion, as
it is now. But accident or nature favored young Viola.
She learned, as of course, her mother’s language with
her father’s. And she contrived soon to read and to
write; and her mother, who, by the way, was a Roman
Catholic, taught her betimes .to pray. But then, to
counteract all these acquisitions, the, strange habits of

helped silently to weave charmed webs over Viola’s im-
aginatiOn, that after-thought and later years might labor
vainly to dispel. And all this especially ﬁtted her to
hang, with a fearful joy, upon her father’s music. Those '
visionary strains, ever struggling to translate into wild
and broken sounds the language of unearthly beings,
breathed around her from her birth. Thus you might
have said that her whole mind was full of music—asso-
ciations, memories, sensations of pleasure or pain, all
were mixed up inexplicably with those sounds that now
delighted and now terriﬁed —that greeted her when her
eyes opened to the sun, and woke her trembling on her
lonely couch in the darkness of the night The legends
and tales of Gionetta only served to make the child better
understand the signiﬁcation of those mysterious tones;
they furnished her with words to the music. It was natu-

in the ear and the voice. She was yet a child when she
sang divinely. A great Cardinal—great alike in the state
and the Conservatorio—heard of her gifts, and sent for
her. From that moment her fate was decided: she was
to be the future glory of Naples, the prima. donna of San
Carlo. The Cardinal insisted upon the accomplishment
of his own predictions, and provided her with the most
renowned masters. To inspire her with emulation, his
Eminence took her one evening to his own box: it would
be something to see the performance, something mor; to
hear the applause lavished upon the glittering signoras
she was hereafter to excel ! Oh, how gloriously that Life
of the Stage—that fairy World of Music and Song,
dawned upon her! It was the only world that seemed to
correspond with her strange childish thoughts. It ap-
peared to her as if, cast hitherto on a foreign shore, she
was brought at last to see the forms and hear the lan-
guage of her native land. Beautiful and true enthusiasm,
rich with the promise of Genius! Boy or man, thou wilt
never be a poet, if thou hast not felt the ideal, the ro-
mance, the Calypso’s isle that opened to thee, when for
the ﬁrst time, the magic curtain was drawn aside, and let
in the World of Poetry on the World of Prose!
And now the initiation was begun. She was to read,
to study, to depict by a gesture, a look, the passions she
was to delineate on the boards; lessons dangerous, in
truth, to some, but not to the pure enthusiasm that comes
from Art; for the mind that rightly conceives Art, is but
a mirror, which gives back what is cast on its surface

faithfully only—while unsullied. She seized on nature
and truth intuitively. Her recitations became full of un-
conscious power; her voice moved the heart to tears, or
warmed it into generous rage. But this arose from that
sympathy which genius ever has, even in its earliest inno-
cence, with whatever feels, or aspires, or suffers. It was
no premature woman comprehending the love or the
jealousy that the words expressed ; her art was one of
those strange secrets which the psychologists may un-
riddle to us if they please, and tell us why children of the
simplest minds‘and the purest hearts are often so acute
to distinguish, in the tales you tell them, or the songs you
sing, the difference between the true Art and the False—
Passion and Jargon—Homer and Racine;—echoing
back, from hearts that haVe not yet felt what they repeat,
the melodious accents of the natural pathos. Apart from
her studies, Viola was a simple, affectionate, but some-
what wayward child ; wayward, not in temper, for that
was sweet and docile, but in her moods, which, as I before
hinted, changed from sad to gay and gay to sad without
an apparent cause. If cause there were, it must be traced
to the early and mysterious inﬂuences I have referred to,
when seeking to explain the effect produced on her imagi'
nation by those restless streams of sound that constantly
played around it: for it is noticeable, that to those who
are much alive to the effects of music, airs and tunes often
come back, in the commonest pursuits of life, to vex, as
it were, and haunt them. The music, once admitted to
the soul, becomes also a sort of spirit, and never dies

It wanders perturbedly through the halls and galleries of
the memory, and is often heard again, distinct and living
as when it ﬁrst displaced the wavelets of the air. Now
at times, then, these phantoms of sound ﬂoated back upon
her fancy; if gay, to call a smile from every dimple; if
mournful, to throw a shade upon her brow—to make her
cease from her childish mirth, and sit apart and muse.
Rightly, then, in a typical sense, might this fair crea-
ture, so airy in her shape, so harmonious in her beauty,
so unfamiliar in her ways and thoughts, -—rightly might
she be called a daughter, less of the Musician than the
Music—a being for whom you could imagine that some
fate was reserved, less of actual life than the romance
which, to eyes that can see, and hearts that can feel, glides
ever along with the actual life, stream by stream, to the
Dark Ocean.
And therefore it seemed not strange that Viola herself,
even in childhood, and yet more as she bloomed into the
sweet seriousness of virgin youth, should fancy her life
ordained for a lot, whether of bliss or woe, that should
accord with the romance and reverie which made the
atmosphere she breathed. Frequently she would climb
through the thickets that clothed the neighboring grotto
of Posilipo —the mighty work of the old Cimmerians, —-
and, seated by the haunted Tomb of Virgil, indulge those
visions, the subtle vagueness of which no poetry can render
palpable and deﬁned :—for the Poet that surpasses all
who ever sung—is the Heart of dreaming Youth 1 Fre-

vine-leaves clung, and facing that dark-blue, waveless sea,
she would sit in the autumn noon or summer twilight, and
build her castles in the air. Who doth not do the same
--not in youth alone, but with the dimmed hopes of age!
It is man’s prerogative to dream, the common royalty of
peasant and of king. But those day-dreams of hers were
more habitual, distinct, and solemn, than the greater part
of us indulge. They seemed like the Orama of the Greeks
—prophets while phantasma.

rosa is hard at work at another Matrimon'io Segreto. But
in the meanwhile there is a check in the diplomacy some-
where. The Cardinal is observed to be out of humor.
He has said publicly — and the words are portentous—
“The silly girl is as mad as her father—what she asks
is preposterous 1” Conference follows conference—the
Cardinal talks to the poor child very solemnly in his closet
--all in vain. Naples is distracted with curiosity and
conjecture. The lecture ends in a quarrel, and Viola
comes home sullen and pouting: she will not act—she
has renounced the engagement. _
Pisani, too inexperienced to be aware of all the dangers
of the stage, had been pleased at the notion that one, at
least, of his name, would add celebrity to his art. The

out came a wild, merry, ringing note, like a laugh ; but
not mortal laughter. It was one of his most successful
airs from his beloved opera—the Siren in the act of
charming the waves and the winds to sleep. Heaven
knows what next would have come, but his arm was
arrested. Viola had thrown herself on his breast, and
kissed him, with happy eyes that smiled through her sunny
hair. At that very moment the door opened—a message
from the Cardinal. Viola must go to his Eminence at
once. Her mother went with her. All was reconciled
and settled; Viola had her way, and selected her own
opera. 0 ye dull nations of the North, with your broils
and debates—your bustling lives of the Pnyx and the
Agora l—you cannot guess what a stir throughout musi_
cal Naples was occasioned by the rumor of a new opera
and a new singer. But whose the opera? No cabinet
intrigue ever was so secret. Pisani came back one night
from the theatre, evidently disturbed and irate. Woe to
thine ears hadst thou heard the barbiton that night!
They had suspended him from his ofﬁce—they feared that
the new opera, and the ﬁrst debut of his daughter as
prima donna, would be too much for his nerves. And
his variations, his dia-blerie of sirens and harpies, on such
a. night, made a hazard not to be contemplated without
awe. To be set aside, and on the very night that his
child. whose melody was but an emanation of his own, was
to perform—set aside for some new rival-it was too much
for a musician’s ﬂesh and blood. For the ﬁrst time he
spoke in words upon lthe subject, and gravely asked - for

that question the barbiton, eloquent as it was, could not
express distinctly — what was to be the opera, and what
the part? And Viola as gravely answered that she was
pledged to the Cardinal not to reveal. Pisani said nothing,
but disappeared with the violin ; and presently they heard
the Familiar from the house-top (whither, when thoroughlv
out of humor, the Musician sometimes ﬂed), whining and
sighing as if its heart were broken.
The affections of Pisani were little visible on the sur-
face. He was not one of those fond, caressing fathers
whose children are ever playing round their knees; his
mind and soul were so thoroughly in his art, that domestic
life glided by him, seemingly as if that were a dream, and
the heart the substantial form and body of existence.
Persons much cultivating an abstract study are often thus;
mathematicians proverbially so. When his servant ran
to the celebrated French philosopher, shrieking, “The
house is on ﬁre, sir l ” “ Go and tell my wife then, fool I”
said the wise man, settling back to his problems; “ do 1
ever meddle with domestic affairs ?” But what are mathe-
matics to music,-music, that not only composes operas,
but plays on the barbiton? Do you know what the illns-_
trious Giardini said when the tyro asked how long it
would take to learn to play on the violin? Hear, and
despair, ye who would bend the bow to which that of
Ulysses was a plaything—“ Twelve hours a day for twenty
years together i ” Can a man, then,, who plays the bar-
biton be always playing also with his little ones? N0,

poor Viola had stolen from the room to weep at the
thought that thou didst not love her. And yet, under-
neath this outward abstraction of the artist, the natural
fondness ﬂowed all the same; and as she grew up, the
dreamer had understood the dreamer. And now, shut
out from all fame himself— to be forbidden to bail even
his daughter’s fame l—and that daughter herself to be in

Now, notwithstanding the triumph both of the singer
and the opera, there had been one moment in the ﬁrst
act, and, consequently, before the arrival of Pisani, when
the scale seemed more than doubtful. It was in a chorus
replete with all the peculiarities of the composer. And
when this Maelstrom of Capricci whirled and foamed, and
tore ear and sense through every variety of sound, the
. audience simultaneously recognized the hand of Pisani.
A title had been given to the opera, which had hitherto
prevented all suspicion of its parentage ; and the overture
and opening, in which the music had been regular and

sweet, had led the audience to fancy they detected the
genius of their favorite Paisiello. Long accustomed to
ridicule and almost to despise the pretensions of Pisani
as a composer, they now felt as if they had been unduly
cheated into the applause with which they had hailed the
overture and the commencing scenas. An ominous buzz
circulated round the house ; -the singers, the orchestra
—electrically sensitive to the impression of the audience
-grew, themselves, agitated and dismayed, and failed in
the energy and precision which could alone carry off the
grotesqneness of the music.
There are always in every theatre many rivals to a new
author, and a new performer—a party impotent while all
goes well—but a dangerous ambush the instant some ac-
cident throws into confusion the march of success. A hiss
arose ; it was partial, it is true, but the signiﬁcant silence
of all applause seemed to forebode the coming moment
when the displeasure would grow contagious. It was the
breath that stirred the impending avalanche. At that
critical moment—Viola, the Siren queen, emerged for the
ﬁrst time from her ocean cave. As she came forward to
the lamps, the novelty of her situation, the chilling apathy
of the audience—which even the sight of so singular a
beauty did not at the ﬁrst arouse—the whispers of the
malignant singers on the stage, the glare of the lights,
and more—far more than the rest—that recent hiss, which
had reached her in her concealment, all froze up her fan.

the regal Siren, re-transformed into the trembling girl,
stood pale and mute before the stern, cold array of those
countless eyes.
At that instant, and when consciousness itself seemed
about to fail her—as she turned a timid beseeching glance
around the still multitude—she perceived, in a box near
the stage, a countenance which at once, and like magic,
produced on her mind an effect never to be analyzed nor
forgotten. It was one that awakened an indistinct, haunt-
ing reminiscence, as if she had seen it in those day-dreams
she had been so wont from infancy to indulge. She could
not withdraw her gaze from that face, and as she gazed,
the awe and coldness that had before seized her, vanished
like a mist from before the sun.
In the dark splendor of the eyes that met her own,
there was indeed so much of gentle encouragement, of
benign and compassionate admiration; so much that
warmed, and animated, and nerved ; that any one—actor“
or orator—who has ever observed the effect that a single
earnest, and kindly look, in the crowd that is to be
addressed and won, will produce upon his mind, may
readily account for the sudden and‘inspiriting inﬂuence
which the eye and smile of the stranger exercised on the
debutante.
And while yet she gazed, and the glow returned to her
heart, the stranger half rose, as if to recall the audience
to a sense of the courtesy due to one so fair and young;
and the instant his voice gave the signal, the audience
followed it by a burst of generous applause. For this

stranger himself was a marked personage, and his recen.
arrival at Naples had divided with the new opera the
gossip of the city. And then as the applause ceased—
clear, full, and freed from every fetter—like a spirit from
the clay—the Siren’s voice poured forth its entrancing
music. From that time, Viola forgot the crowd, the
hazard, the whole world—eXcept the fairy one over which
she presided. It seemed that the stranger’s presence
only served still more to heighten that delusion, in which
the artist sees no creation without the circle of his art;
she felt as if that serene brow, and those brilliant eyes,
inspired her with powers never known before : and, as if
searching for a language to express the strange sensations
occasioned by his presence, that presence itself whispered
to her the melody and the song.
Only when all was over, and she saw her father and
felt hisjoy, did this wild spell vanish before the sweeter
one of the household and ﬁlial love. Yet again, as she
turned from the stage, she looked back involuntarily, and
the stranger’s calm and half-melancholy smile sunk into
her heart—to live there _to be recalled with confused
memories, half of pleasure and half of pain.
Pass over the congratulations of the good Cardinal

And a happy reunion it was round that humble table ;
a feast Lucullus might have envied in his Hall of Apollo,
in the dried grapes, and the dainty sardines, and the
luxurious polenta, and the old lacrina, a present from the
good Cardinal. The barbiton, placed on a chair—a tall,
high-backed chair—beside the musician, seemed to take
a part in the festive meal. Its honest varnished face
glowed in the light of the lamp; and there was an imp-
ish, sly demureness in its very silence, as its master,
between every mouthful, turned to talk to it of something
he had forgotten to relate before. The good wife looked
ou affectionately, and could not eat forjoy; but suddenly

she rose, and placed on the artist’s temples a laurel
wreath, which she had woven beforehand in fond antici-
pation; and Viola, on the other side her brother, the
barbiton, rearranged the chaplet, and smoothing back her
father’s hair, whispered, “Caro Padre, you will not let
him scold me againl”
Then poor Pisani, rather distracted between the two,
and ekeited both by the lacrina and his triumph, turned
to the younger child with so naive and grotesque a pride,
“ I don’t know which to thank the most. You give me
so much joy, child,—I am so proud of thee and myself.
But he and I, poor fellow, have been so often unhappy
together l ”
Viola’s sleep was broken;—that was natural. The
intoxication of vanity and triumph, the happiness in the
happiness she had caused, all this was better than sleep.
But still from all this, again and again her thoughts ﬂew
to those haunting eyes, to that smile with which for ever
the memory of the triumph, of the happiness, was to be
united. Her feelings, like her own character, were strange
and peculiar. They were not those of a girl whose
heart, for the ﬁrst time, reached through the eye, sighs
its natural and native language of ﬁrst love. It was‘not
so much admiration, though the face that reﬂected itself
on every wave of her restless fancies was of the rarest
order of majesty and beauty; nor a pleased and en-
amoured recollection that the sight of this stranger had
bequeathed; it was a human sentiment of gratitude and
delight, mixed with something more mysterious, of fear

and awe. Certainly she had seen before those features;
but when and how? only when her thoughts had sought
to shape out her future, and when in spite of all the
attempts to vision forth a fate of ﬂowers and sunshine, a
dark and chill foreboding made her recoil back into her
deepest self. It was a something found that had long
been sought for by a thousand restless yearnings and
vague desires, less of the heart than mind; not as when
youth discovers the one to be beloved, but rather as
when the student, long wandering after the clue to some
truth in science, sees it glimmer dimly before him, to
beckon, to recede, to allure, and to wane again. She fell
at last into unquiet slumber, vexed by deformed, ﬂeeting,
shapeless phantoms; and, waking, as the sun, through a
veil of hazy cloud, glinted with a sickly ray across the
easement, she heard her father settled back betimes to
his one pursuit, and calling forth from his Familiar a low
mournful strain, like a dirge over the dead.
“And why,” she asked, when she descended to the room
below,-——“why, my father, was your inspiration so sad,
after the joy of last night?”
“ I know not, child. I meant to be merry, and compose
an-air in honor of thee: but he is an obstinate fellow,
this,—and he would have it so.”

1i was the custom of Pisani, except when the duties
of his profession made special demand on his time, to
devote a certain portion of the mid-day to sleep ; a habit
not so much a luxury as a necessity, to a man who slept
very little during the night. In fact, whether to compose
or to practise, the hours of noon were precisely those in
which Pisani could not have been active if he would.
His genius resembled those fountains full at dawn and
evening, overﬂowing at night, and perfectly dry at the
meridian. During this time, consecrated by her husband
to repose, the Signora generally stole out to make the
purchases necessary for the little household, or to enjoy,
as what woman does not, a little relaxation in gossip with
some of her own sex. And the day following this bril-
liant triumph, how many congratulations would she have
to receivel a

sheltered from the sun, without obstructing the view;

which her eye roves listlessly from time to time, you may
behold her, the vine-leaves clustering from their arching
trellis over the door behind, and the lazy white-sailed
boats skimming along the Sea that-stretched before.
As she thus sat, rather in reverie than thought, a man
coming from the direction of Posilipo, with a slow step
and downcast eyes, passed close by the house, and Viola
looking up abruptly, started in a kind of terror as she
recognized the stranger. She uttered an involuntary
exclamation, and the cavalier turning, saw, and paused.
He stood a moment or two between her and the sunlit
ocean, contemplating in a silence too serious and gentle
for the boldness of gallantry, the blushing face and the
young slight form before him : at length he spoke.
“Are you happy, my child,” he said, in almost a paternal
tone, “ at the career that lies before you ? From sixteen
to thirty, the music in the breath of applause is sweeter
than all the music your voice can utter!”
“ I know not,” replied Viola, falteringly, but encouraged
by the liquid softness of the accents that addressed her-
“I know not whether I am happy now, but I was last
night. And I feel, too, Excellency, that I have you to
Y thank, though, perhaps, you scarce know why i ”
“ You deceive yourself,” said the cavalier, with a smile.
“I am aware that I assisted to your merited success, and
it is you who scarce know how. The why I will tell you :
because I saw in year heart a nobler ambition than that _
of the woman’s vanity; it was the daughter that interested
me. Perhaps you would rather I should have admired
the singer ? ”

“No; oh, no!”
“Well, I believe you. And now, since we have thus
met, I will pause tocounsel you. When next you go to the
theatre, you will have at your feet all the young gallants
of Naples. Poor infant! the ﬂame that dazzles the eye
can scorch the wing. Remember that the only homage
that does not sully, must be that which these gallants
will not give thee. And whatever thy dreams of the
futhre—and I see, while I speak to thee, how wandering
they are, and wild—may only these be fulﬁlled which
centre round the hearth of home!”
He paused, as Viola’s breast heaved beneath its robe.
And with a burst of natural and innocent emotions,
scarcely comprehending, though an Italian, the grave
nature of his advice, she exclaimed—
“Ah, Excellency, you cannot know how dear to me
that home is already. And my father— there would be
no home, Signor, without him!”
A deep and melancholy shade settled over the face of
the cavalier. He looked up at the quiet house buried
amidst the vine-leaves, and turned again to the vivid,
animated face of the young actress.
“It is well,” said be. “A simple heart may be its own
best guide, and so, go on, and prosper. Adieu, fair
singer.”
“Adieu, Excellency; but,”-—and something she could
not resist—an anxious, sickening feeling of fear and
hope—impelled her to the question, “I shall see you
again, shall I not, at San Carlo?”

“ Not, at least, for some time. I leave Naples to
day.”
“ Indeed l” and Viola’s heart sunk within her: the
poetry of the stage was gone.
“And,” said the cavalier, turning back, and gently
laying his hand on hers -—“ and perhaps, before we meet,
you may have suﬂ'ered;—-knowu the ﬁrst sharp griefs
of human life;-—known how little what fame can gain,
repays what the heart can lose ; but be brave and yield
not-not even to what may seem the piety of sorrow.
Observe you tree in your neighbor’s garden. Look how
it grows up, crooked and distorted. Some wind scat-
tered the germ, from which it sprung, in the clefts of the
rock; choked up and walled round by crags and buildings,
by nature and man, its life has 'been one struggle for the
light; —light which makes to that life, the necessity and
the principle: .you see how it has writhed and twisted ——
how, meeting the barrier in one spot, it has labored and
worked, stem and branches, towards the clear skies at
last. What has preserved it through each disfavor of
birth and circumstances—Why are its leaves as green
and fair as those of the vine behind you, which, with all
its arms, can embrace the open sunshine ? My child,
because of the very instinct that impelled the struggle—-
because the labor for the light won to the light at length.
So with a gallant heart, through every adverse accident
of sorrow, and of fate, to turn to the sun, to strive for
the heaven ; this it is that gives knowledge to the strong,
and happiness to the weak. Ere we meet again, you will

turn sad and heavy eyrs to those quiet bonghs, and when
you hear the birds sing from them, and see the sunshine
come aslant from crag and house-top to be the playfellow
of their leaves, learn the lesson that Nature teaches you,
and strive through darkness to the lightl”
As he spoke he moved on slowly, and left Viola won-
dering—silent—saddened with his dim prophecy of com-
ing evil, and yet, through sadness, charmed. Involuntarily
her eyes followed him —involuntarily she stretched forth
her arms, as if by a gesture to call him back; she would
have given worlds to have seen him turn-to have heard
once more his low, calm, silvery voice,--to have felt
again the light touch of his hand on hers. As moonlight
that softens into beauty every angle on which it 'falls,‘
seemed his presence,—as moonlight vanishes, and things
assume their common aspect of the rugged and the mean
-he receded from her eyes,—and the outward scene was
commonplace once more.
The stranger passed on, through that long and lovely
road which reaches at last the palaces that face the public
gardens, and conducts to the more populous quarters of
the city.
A group of young, dissipated courtiers, loitering by
the gateway of a house which was open for the favorite
pastime of the day—the resort of the wealthier and more
high-born gamesters-made way for him, as with a cour-
teous inclination he passed them by.
“ Perfede,” said one, “is not that the rich Zanoni, of
whom the town talks?"

“Whence came he ?”
“ From some sea-port in the East. My valet learned
from some of the sailors on the Mole that he had resided
many years in the interior of India.”
“ Ah, I am told that in India men pick up gold like
pebbles, and that there are valleys where the birds build
their nests with emeralds to attract the moths. Here
comes our prince of gamesters, Cetoxa; be sure that he
already must have made acquaintance with so wealthy a
cavalier; he has that attraction to gold which the magnet

“ My dear Belgioso, nothing more natural. He desired
a box at San Carlo; but I need not tell you that the ex-
pectation of a new opera (ah, how superb it is,--that
poor devil, Pisani—who would have thought it?) and a
new singer-(what a face — what a. voice ! —ah i) had
engaged every corner of the house. I heard of Zanoni’s
desire to honor the talent of Naples, and, with my usual
courtesy to distinguished strangers, I sent to place my

man, who had crossed himself two or three times during
the Neapolitan’s narrative, “are you not aware of the
strange reports about this person ; and are you not afraid

that he saw this same Zanoni seventy years ago-(he
himself, the narrator, then a mere boy)_-at Milan. When
this very Zanoni, as you all see, is at least as young as

“But that,” said the grave gentleman, “that is the
mystery. Old Avelli declares that Zanoni does not seem
a day older than when they met at Milan. He says that

another name, this Zanoni appeared in the same splendor,
he was attended also by the same mystery. And that an
old man there remembered to have seen him sixty years
before, in Sweden.”

said of the quack Cagliostro—mere fables. I will believe

Oetoxa was a redoubted swordsman, and excelled in a

In the midst of this desolation is an old building of the
middle ages. Here dwells a singular Recluse. In the
season of the malaria, the native peasant ﬂies the rank
vegetation round; but he, a stranger and a foreigner,
breathes in safety the pestilential air. He has no friends,
no associates, no companions, except books and instru-
ments of science. He is often seen wandering over the
grass-grown bills, or sauntering through the streets of
the new city, not with the absent brow and incurious air
of students, but with observant, piercing eyes, that seem
to dive into the hearts of the passers-by. An old man,
but not inﬁrm—erect and stately, as if in his prime. None
know whether he be rich or poor. He asks no charity,
and he gives none—he does no evil, and seems to confer
no good. He is a man who appears to have no world
beyond himself; but appearances arc deceitful; and Sci-
ence, as well as Benevolence, lives in the Universe. This
abode, for the ﬁrst time since thus occupied, a visitor
. enters. It is Zanoni.
You observe those two men seated together, conversing
earnestly. Years long and many have ﬂown away since
they met last—at least, bodily, and face to face. But if
they are sages, thought can meet thought, and spirit

They converse—they confess to each other—they con~
jure up the past, and re-pe0ple it; but note how (llffer-
ently do such remembrances ali'ect the two. On Zanoui’
face, despite its habitual calm, the emotions change, and
go. He has acted in the past he surveys; but not a trace
of the humanity that participates in ‘joy and sorrow can
be detected on the passionless visage of his companion ;
the Past, to him, as is now the Present, has been but as
nature to the sage, the volume to the student—a calm
and spiritual life—a study—a contemplation.
From the Past, they turn to the Future. . Ah let the
close of the last century, the Future seemed a thing tan-
gible—it was woven up in all men’s fears and hopes of
the Present. ‘
At the verge of that'hnndred years, Man, the ripest-
born of Time,* stood as at the death-bed of the Old
World, and beheld the New Orb, blood-red amidst cloud
and vapor,-uncertain if a comet or a sun. Behold the
icy and profound disdain on the brow of the old man-
the lofty yet touching sadness that darkens the glorious
Eountenance of Zanoni. Is it that one views with con-
tempt the struggle and its issue, and the other with we
or pity? Wisdom contemplating mankind lends but to
the two results—compassion or disdain. He who believes
_in other worlds can accustom himself to look on this as
the naturalist on the revolutions of an ant-hill, or of a

CHAPTER VI.
Précepteurs iguorans de ce faible univers.*
VOLTAIBE.
Nous étions a table chez un de nos confreres a l’Académie, Grand
Seigneur et homme d’esprit.1- ——LA Hanna.
ONE evening, at Paris, several months after the date
of our last chapter, there was a reunion of some of the
most eminent wits of the time, at the houseiof a person-
age distinguished alike by noble birth and liberal accom-
plishments. Nearly all present were of the views that
were .then the mode. For, as came afterwards a time
when nothing was so unpopular as the people, so that
was the time when nothing was so vulgar as aristocracy.
The airiest ﬁne gentleman and the haughtiest noble prated
of equality, and lisped enlightenment.
Among the more remarkable guests were Condorcet,
then in the prime of his reputation, the correspondent of
the king of Prussia, the intimate of Voltaire, the member
of half the academies of Europe-noble by'birth, polished
in manners, republican in opinions. There, too, was the
venerable Malesherbes, “l’amour et les delices de la'

Nation!"l There Jean Silvain Bailly, the accomplished
scholar—the aspiring politician. It was one of those
petite soupers for which the capital of all social pleasures
was so renowned. The conversation, as might be ex-
pected, was literary and intellectual, enlivened by grace-
ful pleasantry. Many of the ladies of that ancient and
proud noblesse—“for the noblesse yet existed, though its
i hours were already numbered_ added to the charm of
the society; and theirs were the boldest criticisms, and
often the most liberal sentiments.
Vain labor for me — vain labor almost for the grave
English language, to do justice to the sparkling para-
doxes that ﬂew from lip to lip. The favorite theme was
the superiority of the Moderns to the Ancients. Con-
dorcet on this head was eloquent, and to some, at least,
of his audience, most convincing. That Voltaire was
greater than Homer, few there were disposed to deny.
Keen was the ridicule lavished on the dull pedantry which
ﬁnds everything ancient necessarily sublime.
“ Yet,” said the graceful marquis de —. as the cham-
pagne danced to his glass, “more ridiculous still is the
superstition that ﬁnds everything incomprehensible holy l
But intelligence circulates, Condorcet ; like water, it ﬁnds
its level. My hairdresser said to me this morning, ‘ Though
I am but a poor fellow, I believe as little as the ﬁnest
gentleman 1’ ”
“Unquestionably, the great Revolution draws near to

its ﬁnal completion—d pas de géant, as Montesquieu said
of his own immortal work.”
Then there rushed from all—wit and noble, courtier
and republican ——a confused chorus, harmonious only in
its anticipation of the brilliant things to which “ the
great Revolution ” was to give‘birth. Here Condorcet
is more eloquent than.before.
“Il faut absolument que la Superstition et le Fana-
tisme fassent place ala philosophie.* Kings persecute
persons, priests opinion. Without kings, men must be
safe; and without priests, minds must be free.”
“Ah,” murmured the marquis, “ and as 0e cher Diderot
has so well sung-
“ ‘Et dcs hoyaux du dernier prétre
Serrez 1e 00u du dernier roi.’ "1-
“And then,” resumed Condorcet—“theu commences
the Age of Reason l—equality in instruction—equality
in institutions—equality in wealth l The great impedi-
ments to knowledge are, ﬁrst, the want of a common
language; and. next, the short duration of existence.
But as to the ﬁrst, when all men are brothers, why not
an universal language? As to the second, the organic
perfectibility'of the vegetable world is undisputed: is
Nature less powerful in the nobler existence of thinking

of physical deterioration—here, luxurious wealth,-there,
abject penury—must necessarily prolong the general term
of life.* The art of medicine will then be honored in
the place of war, which is the art of murder: the noblest
study of the acutest minds will be devoted to the dis-
covery and arrest of the Causes of disease. Life, I grant,
cannot be made eternal; but it may be prolonged almost
indeﬁnitely. And as the meaner animal bequeathes its
vigor to its offspring, so man shall transmit his improved
organization, mental and physical, to his sons. 0 yes,
to such a consummation does our age approach 1”
The venerable Malesherbes sighed. Perhaps he feared
the consummation might not come in time for him. The
handsome marquis de and the ladies, yet haudsomer

than he, looked conviction and delight.
But two' men there were, seated next to each other,
who joined not in the general talk; the one a sﬁangert
newly arrived in Paris, where his wealth, his person, and
his accomplishments, had already made him remarked
and courted; the other, an old man, somewhere about
seventy—the witty and virtuous, brave and still light-
hearted Cazotte, the author of Le Diable Amuureux.
These two conversed familiarly, and apart from the
rest, and only by an occasional smile testiﬁed their atten-
tion to the general conversation.
“Yes,” said the stranger—“yes, we have met be-
fore." '

“ I thought I could not forget your countenance ; yet
I task in vain my recollections of the past.”
“I will assist you. Recall the time when, led by
curiosity, or perhaps the nobler desire of knowledge, you
sought initiation into the mysterious order of Martines
de Pasquales.”* '
“Ahl is it possiblel- You are one of that theurgic
brotherhood ? ”
“ Nay, I attended their ceremonies but to see h0w vainly
they sought to revive the ancient marvels of the cabala.”
“ Such studies please you? I have shaken off the in-
ﬂuence they once had on my own imagination.”-

* It is so recorded of Gazette. Of Martines de Pasqualis little
is known; even the country to which he belonged is matter of con-
jecture. Equally so the rites, ceremonies, and nature of the caba-
listic order he established. St. Martin was a disciple of the school,
and that, at least, is in its favor; for in spite of his mysticism, no
man more beneﬁcent, generous, pure, and virtuous, than St. Martin,
adorned the last century. Above all, no man more distinguished
himself from the herd of skeptical philosophers by the gallantry
and fervor with which he combated materialism, and vindicated
the necessity of faith amidst a chaos of unbelief. It may also be
observed, that Cazotte, whatever else he learned of the brother-
hood of Martines, learned nothing that diminished the excellence
of his life and the sincerity of his religion. At_onee gentle and
brave, he never ceased to oppose the excesses of the Revolution.
To the last, unlike the Liberals of his time, he was a devout and
sincere Christian. Before his execution, he demanded a pen and
paper, to write these words: -- “ Ma femme, mes enfans, ne me
pleurez pas; ne m’oubliez pus, msis souvenez-vous surtout do no
jamais oﬂ'enser Dieu.” (a)— ED.

remember above everything never to offend God.

“You have not shaken it off,” returned the stranger
gravely ; “it is on you still-on you at this hour; it beats
in your heart; it kindles in your reason; it will speak
in your tongue!”
And then with a yet lower voice, the stranger continued
to address him, to remind him of certain ceremonies and
doctrines,—to explain and enforce them by references to
the actual experience and history of his listener, which
CaZotte thrilled to ﬁnd so familiar to a stranger.
Gradually the old man’s pleasing and benevolent coun-
tenance grew overcast, and he turned, from time to time,
searching, curious, uneasy glances, towards his companion.

The charming duchess de G archly pointed out to
the lively guests the abstracted air and clouded brow of
the poet; and Condorcet, who liked no one else to be
remarked when he himself was present, said to Cazotte,
“Well, and what do you predict of the Revolution—
how, at least, will it affect us?”
At that question, Cazotte started—his cheeks grew
pale, large drops stood on his forehead—his lips writhed.
His gay companions gazed on him in surprise.
“Speakl” whispered the stranger, laying his hand
gently upon the arm of the old wit.
At that word, Cazotte’s face grew locked and rigid,
nis eyes dwelt vacantly on space, and in a low, hollow
voice, he thus answered -*

“ You ask how 1t will affect yourselves,—you, its most
learned, and its least selﬁsh agents. I will answer ; you,
marquis de Condorcet, will die in prison, but not by the
hand of the executioner. In the peaceful happiness of
that day, thd philosopher will carry about with him, not
the elixir, but the poison.” .
“My poor Cazotte,” said Condorcet, with his gentle
smile, “what have prisons, executioners, and poison, to
do with an age of liberty and brotherhood?”
“ It is in the names of Liberty and Brotherhood that
the prisons will reek, and the headsman be glutted.”
“'You are thinking of priestcraft, not philosophy,
Gazette,” said Champfort.*—-“And what of me?”
“ You will open your own veins to escape the fraternity
of Cain. Be comforted; the last drops will not follow
the razor. For you, venerable Malesherbes,-.-for you,

The hush was complete and universal when the pupil
of Voltaire—the prince of the academic skeptics, hot
La Harpe—cried, with a sarcastic laugh, “ Do not ﬂatter
me, O prophet, by exemption from the fate of my com-
panions. Shall I have no part to play in this drama of
your phantasies?”
At this question, Cazotte’s countenance lost its un~
natural expression of awe and sternness: the sardonic
humor most common to it came back and played in his
brightening eyes.
“Yes, La Harpe, the most wonderful part of all! You
will become— a Christian ! ”
This was too much for the audience that a moment
before seemed grave and thoughtful, and they burst into
an immoderate ﬁt of laughter, while Cazotte, as if ex-
hausted by his predictions, sunk back in his chair, and
breathed hard and heavily.
“Nay,” said Madame de G-—, “you who have pre-
dicted such grave things concerning us, must prophesy
something also about yourself.”
A convulsive tremor shook the involuntary prophet ;--
it passed, and left his countenance elevated by an ex-
pression of resignation and calm. “Madame,” said be,
after a long pause, “during the siege of Jerusalem, we
are told by its historian that a man, for seven successive
days, went round the ramparts, exclaimiug, “Woe to
thee, Jerusalem, woe to myself!”
“Well, Cazotte, well?”

With these words Cazotte arose ; and the guests, awed
in spite of themselves, shortly afterwards broke up and
retired.

IT was some time before midnight when the stranger
returned home. His apartments were situated in one of
those vast abodes which may be called an epitome of
Paris itself. The cellars rented by mechanics, scarcely
removed a step from paupers, often by outcasts and
fugitives from the law,-often by some daring writer,
who, after scattering amongst the people doctrines the
most subversive of order, or the most libellous on the
characters of priest, minister, and king ——retired amongst
the rats, to escape the persecution that attends the vir-i

by artists-the principal stories by nobles— and the
garrets by journeymen 0r grisettes
As the stranger passed up the stairs, a young man of a
form and countenance singularly unprepossessing, emerged
from a door in the entresol, and brushed beside him. His
glance was furtive, sinister, savage, and yet timorous;
the man’s face was of an ashen paleness, and the features
worked convulsively. The stranger paused, and observed
him with thoughtful looks, as he hurried down the stairs.
While he thus stood, he heard a groan from the room
which the young man had just quitted; the latter had
pulled to the door with hasty vehemence, but some frag-
ment, probably of fuel, had prevented its closing, and it
new stood slightly ajar; the stranger pushed it open and
entered. He passed a small ante-room, meanly furnished,
and stood in a bed-chamber of meagre and sordid dis-
comfort. Stretched on the bed, and writhing in pain,
lay an old man ; a single candle lit the room, and threw
its feeble ray over the furrowed and death-like face of the
sick person. No attendant was by; he seemed left alone
to breathe his last. “ Water,” he moaned, feebly—
“ water—I parch—I burn l” The intruder approached
the bed, bent over him, and took his hand —— " Oh, bless
thee, Jean, bless thee!” said the sufferer; “hast thou
brought back the physician already? Sir, I am poor,
but I can pay you well. I would not die yet, for that
young man’s sake.” And he sat upright in his bed, and
ﬁxed his dim eyes anxiously on his visitor.
“What are your symptoms, your disease?”

“ Fire- ﬁre—ﬁre in the heart, the entrails—I burn l”
“How long is it since you have taken food?”
“ Food 1 only this broth. There is the basin, all I'have
taken three six hours. I had scarce drunk it ere these
pains began.”
The stranger looked at the basin: some portion of the
contents was yet left there.
“Who administered this to you?”
“Who? Jean I Who else should? I have no servant
-—nonel I am poor, very poor, sir. But nol you
physicians do not care for the poor. I am rich! can
you cure me ?”
“ Yes, if Heaven permit. Wait but a few moments.”
The old man was fast sinking under the rapid effects
of poison. The stranger repaired to his own apartments,
and returned in a few moments with some preparation
that had the instant result of an antidote. The pain
ceased, the blue and livid color receded from the lips;
the old man fell into a profound sleep. The stranger
drew the curtains round the bed, took up the light, and
inspected the apartment. The walls of both rooms were
hung with drawings of masterly excellence. A portfolio
was ﬁlled with sketches of equal skill: but these last
were mostly subjects that appalled the eye and revolted
the taste: they displayed the human .ﬁgure in every
variety of suffering—the rack, the wheel, the gibbet, all
that cruelty has invented to sharpen the pangs of death,
seemed yet more dreadful from the passionate gusto and
earnest force of the designer. And some of the counte-

from the ideal to show that they were portraits; in a.
large, bold, irregular hand, was written beneath these
drawings, “ The Future of the Aristocrats.” In a corner
of the room, and close by an old bureau, was a small
bundle, over which, as if to hide it, a cloak was thrown
carelessly. Several shelves were ﬁlled with books; these
were alm0st entirely the works of the philosophers of
the time—the philosophers of the material school, espe-
cially the Encyclopédistes, whom Robespierre afterwards
so singularly attacked, when the coward deemed it unsafe
to leave his reign without a God.* A volume lay on a
table—it was one of Voltaire, and the page was opened
at his argumentative assertion of the existence of the
Supreme Beingf. The margin was covered with pen-
cilled notes, in the stiff but tremnlous hand of old age

cunning—success the rule of right or wrong—honesty as an
affair of taste or decency—and the world as the patrimony of
clever soonndrels.

all in attempt to refute or to ridicule-the logic of the
sage of Ferney: Voltaire did not go far enough for the
annotator! The clock struck two, when the sound of
steps was heard without. The stranger silently seated
himself on the farther side of the bed, and its drapery
screened him, as he sat, from the eyes of a man who now
entered on tiptoe; it was the same person who had
passed him on the stairs. The new comer took up the
candle and approached the bed. The old man’s face was
turned to the pillow‘; but he lay so still, and his breath-
ing was so inaudible, that his sleep might well, by that
hasty, shrinking, guilty glance, be mistaken for the repose
of death. The new comer drew back, and a grim smile
passed over his face : be replaced the candle on the table,
opened the bureau with a key which he took from his
pocket, and loaded himself with several rouleaus of gold,
that he found in the drawers. At this time the old man
began to wake. He stirred, he looked up; he turned his
eyes towards the light now waning in its socket; he saw
the robber at his work; he sat erect for an instant, as if
transﬁxed, more even by astonishment than terror. At
last he sprang from his bed—
“ Just Heaven! do I dream i Thou—thou—thou for
whom I toiled and starved l—Thou!”
The robber started; the gold fell from his hand, and
rolled on the ﬂoor. '

he exclaimed, “Jean! Jean! recall that word. Rob,
plunder me if thou wilt, but do not say then couldst mur-
der one who only lived for thee I There, there, take the
gold; I hoarded it but for thee. Go—gol” and the old
man, who, in his passion, had quitted his bed, fell at the
feet of the foiled assassin, and writhed on the ground—-
the mental agony more intolerable than that of the body,
which he had so lately undergone. The robber looked at
him with a hard disdain. ‘
“ What have I ever done to thee, wretch ?” cried the

spoke, continued coldly to load his person with the rou-
leaus.) “And now, if I spare thy life, how shall I be
sure that thou wilt not inform against mine i” He ad-
vanced with a gloomy scowl and a menacing gesture as

WHEN he again saw the old man the next day, the
stranger found him calm, and surprisingly recovered from
the scene and sufferings of the night. He expressed his
gratitude to his preserver with tearful fervor, and stated
that he had already sent for a relation, who would make
arrangements for his future safety and mode of life.
“For I have money yet left,” said the old man; “ and
henceforth have no motive to be a miser.” He proceeded
then brieﬂy to relate the origin and circumstances of his
connection with his intended murderer.
It seems that in earlier life he had quarrelled with
his relations—from a diﬁ'erence in opinions of belief.
Rejecting all religion as a fable, he yet cultivated feelings
that inclined him—for though his intellect was weak,
his dispositions were good—to that false and exagger

an enfant du peuple He resolved to educate this boy
according to “ Reason.” He selected an orphan of the
lowest extraction, whose defects of person and constitu-
tion only yet the more moved his pity, and ﬁnally engrossed
his affection. In this outcast he not only loved a son,
he loved a theory! He brought him up most philosophi-
cally. Helvetius had proved to him that education can
do all ; and before he was eight years old, the little Jean’s
favorite expressions were -“La lumiére et la vertu.” *
The boy showed talents, especially in art. The protector
sought for a master who was as free from “superstition ”
as himself, and selected the painter David. That person,
as hideous as his pupil, and whose dispositions were as
vicious as his professional abilities were undeniable, was
certainly as free from “superstition” as the protector
could desire. It was reserved for Robespierre hereafter
to make the sanguinary painter believe in the Etre
Supré'me. The boy was early sensible of his ugliness,
which was almost preternatural. His benefactor found
it in vain to reconcile him to the malice of nature by his
philosopical aphorisms; but- when he pointed out to him
that in this world money, like charity, covers a multitude
of defects, the boy listened eagerly and was consoled.
To save money for his protege—for the only thing in
the world he loved-this became the patron’s passion.

never have accused him.”
“No, for you are the author of his crimes.”
“How l I, who never‘ceased to inculcate the beauty
vof virtue? Explain yourself.”
“Alas, if thy pupil did not make this clear to thee last
night from his own lips, an angel might come from heaven
to preach to thee in vain.”
The old man moved uneasily, and was about to reply,
when the relative he had sent for, and who, a native of
Nancy, happened to be at Paris at the time—entered
the room. He was a‘ man somewhat past thirty, and of
a dry, saturnine, meagre countenance, restless eyes, and
compressed lips. He listened, with many ejaculations of
horror, to his relation’s recital, and sought earnestly, but
in vain, to induce him to give information against his
prolégé.
“Tush, tush, Re'né Dumas 1” said the old man, “you
are a lawyer. You are bred to regard human life with
contempt. Let any man break a law, and you shout—-
‘ Execute him 1'”
“I I” cried Dumas, lifting up his hands and eyes:
“venerable sage, how you misjudge me i I lament more
than any one the severity of our code. I think the state
never should take away life —-no, not even the life of a
murderer. I agree with that young statesman—Maxi-
milien Robespierre — that the executioner is the invention
of the tyrant. My very attachment to our advancing
revolution is, that it must sweep away this legal butchery. ”

The lawyer paused, out of breath. The strange]
regarded him ﬁxedly, and turned pale.
“You change countenance, sir,” said Dumas; “you
do not agree with me.”
“Pardon me, I was at that moment repressing a vague
fear which seemed prophetic.”
‘And that ”
“ Was that we should meet again, when your opinions
on Death and the Philosophy of Revolutions might be

“Never!”
“ You enchant me, cousin Rene,” said the old man,
who had listened to his relation with delight. “Ah, I
see you have proper sentiments ofjustice and philanthropy.
Why did I not seek to know you before? You admire
the Revolution ?-you, equally with me, detest the bar-
barity of kings, and the fraud of priests?”
“ Detestl How could I love mankind if I did not I? ”
“And,” said the old man, hesitatingly, “you do not
think, with this noble gentleman, that I erred in the
precepts I instilled into that wretched man?”
“Erredl Was Socrates to blame if Alcibiades was
an adulterer and a traitor?"
“You hear him—you hear him! But Socrates had
also a Plato; henceforth you shall be a Plato to me.

stranger.

with the most stubborn of all bigotries—the fanaticism
of unbelief?
“Are you going?” exclaimed Dumas, “and before I
have thanked you, blessed you, for the life of this dear
and venerable man ? Oh, if ever I can repay you—if ever
you want the heart’s blood of Re'né Dumas!” Thus
volubly delivering himself, he followed the stranger to the
threshold of the second chamber, and there, gently de-
taining him, and after looking over his shoulder, to be
sure that he was not heard by the owner, he whispered,
“ I ought to return to Nancy. One would not lose one’s
time ;—you don’t think, sir, that that scoundrel took away
all the old fool’s money?”
“ Was it thus Plato spoke of Socrates, Monsieur Du-
mas ? ”
“ Ha, ha !—you are caustic. Well, you have a right.
Sir, we shall meet again.”
“ AGAIN l” muttered the stranger, and his brow dark-
ened. He hastened to his chamber, he passed the day
and the night alone, and in studies, no matter of what
nature,—they served to increase his gloom.
What could ever connect his fate with Rene Dumas?
or the fugitive assassin? Why did the buoyant air of
Paris seem to him heavy with the steams of blood ?_why
did an instinct urge him to ﬂy from those sparkling cir-
cles, from that focus of the world’s awakened hopes,

the actress so united, that applause to one is applause to
both. They make way for thee at the orchestra —they
no longer jeer and wink, when, with a ﬁerce fondness,
thou dost caress thy Familiar, that plains, and wails, and
chides, and growls, under thy remorseless hand. They
understand now how irregular is ever the symmetry of
- real genius. The inequalities in its surface make the
moon luminous to man. Giovanni Paisiello, Maestro di
Capella, if thy gentle soul could know envy, thou must
sickcn to see thy Elfrida and thy Pirro laid aside, and all
Naples turned fanatic to the Siren, at whose measures
shook querulously thy gentle head l But thou, Paisiello,
calm in the long prosperity of fame, knowest that the
New will have its day, and comfortest thyself that the
Elfrida and the Pirro will live for ever. Perhaps a mis-
take, but it is by such mistakes that true genius conquers
envy. “ To be immortal,” says Schiller, “live in the
whole.” To be superior to the hour, live in thy self-
csteem. The audience now would give their ears for
those variations and ﬂights they were once wont to hiss.
No l—Pisahi has been two-thirds of a life at silent work
on his master-piece: there is nothing he can add to that,
however he might have sought to improve on the master-
pieces of others. Is not this common ? The least little
critic, in reviewing some work of art, will say, “pity this,
' and pity that,” “this should have been altered—that
omitted.” Yea, with his wiry ﬁddle-string will he ereak
out his accursed variations. But let him sit down and
compose himself. He sees no improvement in variations

then! Every man can control his ﬁddle when it is his
own work with which its vagaries would play the devil.
And Viola is the idol—the theme of Naples. She is
the spoiled sultana of the boards. To spoil her acting
may be easy enough— shall they spoil her nature? No,
I think not. There, at home, she is still good and sim-
ple ; and there, under the awning by the door-way—there
she still sits, divinely musing. How often, crook-trunked
tree, she looks to thy green bonghs ; how often, like thee,
in her dreams and fancies, does she struggle for the light;
—Not the light of the stage-lamps. Pooh, child! be
contented with the lamps, even with the rush-lights. A
farthing candle is more convenient for household purposes
than the stars.
Weeks passed, and the stranger did not re-appear:
months had passed, and his prophecy of sorrow was not
yet fulﬁlled. One evening Pisani was taken ill. His
success had brought on the long-neglected composer
pressing applications for concerti and sonata, adapted to
his more peculiar science on the violin. He had been
employed for some weeks, day and night, on a piece in
which he hoped to excel himself. He took, as usual, one
of those seemingly impracticable subjects which it was his
pride to subject to the expressive powers of his art—~the
terrible legend connected with the transformation of
Philomel. The pantomime of sound opened with the gay
merriment of a feast. The monarch of Thrace is at his
banquet; a sudden discord brays through the joyous
notes-the string seems to screech with horror. The

king learns the murder of his son by the hands of the
avenging sisters. Swift rage the chords, through the
passions of fear, of horror, of fury, and dismay. The
father pursues the ‘sisters. Hark! what changes the
dread—the discord—into that long, silvery, mournful
music ? The transformation is completed; and Philomel,
now the nightingale, pours from the myrtle-bough the full,
liquid, subduing notes that are to tell evermore to the
world the history of her woes and wrongs. Now, it was
in the midst of this complicated and difﬁcult attempt that
the health of the over-tasked musician, excited alike by
past triumph and new ambition, suddenly gave way. He
was taken ill at night. The next morning the doctor
pronounced that his disease was a malignant and infec-
tions fever. His wife and Viola shared in their tender
watch ; but soon that task was left to the last alone. The
Signora Pisani caught the infection, and in a few hours
was even in a state more alarming than that of her hus-
band. :The Neapolitans, in common with the inhabitants
of all warm climates, are apt to become selﬁsh and brutal
in their dread of infections disorders. Gionetta herself
pretended to be ill, to avoid the sick chamber. The whole
labor of love and sorrow fell on Viola. It was a terrible
trial - I am willing to hurry over the details. The wife
died ﬁrst!
One day, a little before sunset, Pisani woke partially
recovered from the delirium which had preyed upon him,
with few intervals, since the second day of the disease ,'
and casting about him his dizzy and feeble eyes, he re-

cognized Viola, and smiled. He faltered her name as he
rose and stretched his arms. She fell upon his breast,
and strove to suppress her tears.
“Thy mother?” he said. “Does she sleep?”
“ She sleeps—ah, yes i” and the tears gushed forth.
“I thought —eh l I know not what I have thought.
But do not weep—I shall be well now—quite well. She
will come to me when she wakes—will she?”
Viola could not speak ; but she busied herself in pour-
ing forth an anodyne, which she had been directed to
give the sufferer as soon as the delirium should cease.
The doctor had told her, too, to send for him the instant
so important a change should occur. ‘
She went to the door, and called to the woman, who,
during Gionetta’s pretended illness, had been induced to
supply her place; but the hireling answered not. She
ﬂew through the chambers to search for her in vain—the
hireling had caught Gionetta’s fears, and vanished. What
was to be done? The case was urgent—the doctor had
declared not a moment should be lost in obtaining his
attendance; she must leave her father—she must go her-
self! She crept back into the room—the anodyne seemed
already to have taken benign effect—the patient’s eyes
were closed, and he breathed regularly, as in sleep. She
stole away, threw her veil over her face, and hurried from
the house.
Now, the anodyne had not produced the eﬂ'ect which
it appeared to have done; instead of healthful sleep, it
had brought on a kind of light-headed somnolenee, in

which the mind, preternaturally restless, wandered about
its accustomed haunts, waking up its old familiar instincts
and inclinations. It was not sleep—it was not delirium;
it was the dream-wakefulness which opium sometimes in-
duces, when every nerve grows tremulously alive, and
creates a corresponding activity in the frame, to which it
gives a false and hectic vigor. Pisani missed something
— what, he scarcely knew; it was a combination of the
two wants most essential to his mental life—the voice of
his wife, the touch of his Familiar. He rose—he left
his bed—he leisurely put on his old dressing-robe, in
which he had been wont to compose. He smiled com-
placently as the associations connected with the garment
came over/his memory ; he walked tremulonsly across the
room, and entered the small cabinet next to his chamber,
in which his wife had been accustomed more often to
watch than sleep, when illness separated her from his
side. The room was desolate and void. He looked
round wistfully, and muttered to himself, and then pro-
ceeded regularly, and with a noiseless step, through the
chambers of the silent house, one by one.
He came at last to that in which old Gionetta,—faith-
ful to her own safety, if nothing else—nursed herself, in
the remotest corner of the house, from the danger of in-
fection. As he glided in—wan, emaciated, with an uneasy,
anxious, searching look in his haggard eyes—the old
woman shrieked aloud, and fell at his feet. He bent over
her, passed his thin hands along her averted face, shook
his head, and said in a hollow voice-—
“I cannot ﬁnd them; where are they?”

“ Who, dear master? Oh, have compassion on your-

enough to kill a whole city. San Gennaro, protect me i
My poor mistress—she is dead—buried, too; and I, your
faithful Gionetta, woe is me 1 Go, go—to—to bed again,
dearest master—go l ”
The poor musician stood for one moment mute and
nnmoving, then a slight shiver ran through his frame;
he turned and glided back, silent and spectre-like, as he
had entered. He came into the room where he had been
accustomed to compose—where his wife, in her sweet
patience, had so ofteri sat by his side, and praised and
ﬂattered when the world had but jeered and scorned. In
one corner he found the laurel-wreath she had placed on
his brows that happy night of fame and triumph; and
near it, half hid by her mantilla, lay in its case the
neglected instrument.
Viola was not long gone ; she had found the physician ;
she returned with him ; and as they gained the threshold,
they heard a strain of music from within, a strain of
piercing, heart-rending anguish: it was not like some
senseless instrument, mechanical in its obedience to a
human hand—it was as some spirit calling in wail and
agony from the forlorn shades, to the angels it beheld
afar beyond the Eternal Gulf. They exchanged glances

of dismay. They hurried into the house—they hastened
into the room. Pisani turned, and his look, full of ghastly
intelligence and stern command, awed them back. The
black mantilla, the faded laurel-leaf, lay there before him.
Viola’s heart guessed all at a single glance—she sprung
to his knees—she clasped them—“ Father, father, Iam
left thee stilll” ‘
The wail ceased -the note changed ;' with a confused
association—half of the man, half of the artist—the
anguish, still a melody, was connected with sweeter sounds
and thoughts. The nightingale had escaped the pursuit
-soft, airy, bird-like,—~thrilled the delicious notes a mo-
ment, and then died away. The instrument fell to the
ﬂoor, and its chords snapped. You heard that sound
through the silence. The artist looked on his kneeling
child, and then on the broken chords. . . . “Bury
me. by her side,” he said, in a very calm, low voice; “ and
that, by mine.” And with these words his whole frame
became rigid, as if turned to stone. The last change
passed over his face. He fell to the ground, sudden and
heavy. The chords there, too—the chords of the human
instrument were snapped asunder. As he fell, his robe
brushed the laurel-wreath, and that fell also, near, but
not in reach of, the dead man’s nerveless hand.
Broken instrument—broken heart—withered laurel-
wreath l—the setting sun through the vine-clad lattice
streamed on all! So smiles the eternal Nature on the
wrecks of all that make life glorious! And not a sun
that sets not somewhere on the silenced music—on the
faded laurel!

primaeval Titan of the great Tyrolese race — often hast
thou sought to scale the heavens, and therefore must thou,
like the meaner children of men, descend to the dismal
Hades! Harder fate for thee than thy mortal master.
For thy soul sleeps with thee in the cofﬁn. And the
music that belongs to his, separate from the instrument,
ascends on high, to be heard often by a daughter’s pious
ears, when the heaven is serene and the earth sad. For
there is a sense of hearing that the vulgar know not. And
the voices of the dead breathe soft and frequent to those

And now Viola is alone in the world; alone in the

you not felt as if the gloom of the altered home was too
heavy for thought to hear ?_you would leave it, though
a palace, even for a cabin. And yet—sad to say—when
you obey the impulse, when you ﬂy from the walls, when
in the strange place in which you seek your refuge nothing
speaks to you of the lost, have ye not felt again a yearn-
ing for that very food to memory which was just before
but bitterness and gall? Is it not almost impious and
profane to abandon that dear hearth to strangers ? And
the desertion of the home where your parents dwelt, and
blessed you, upbraids your conscience as if you had sold
their tombs. Beautiful was the Etruscan superstition,
that the ancestors become the household gods. Deaf is
the heart to which the Lares call from the desolate ﬂoors
in vain. At ﬁrst Viola had, in her intolerable anguish,
gratefully welcomed the refuge which the house and family
of a kindly neighbor, much attached to her father, and
who was one of the orchestra that Pisani shall perplex no
more, had proffered to the orphan. But the company of

no loss to mourn. Go back to thy solitude, young or-
phan—go hack to thy home : the sorrow that meets thee
on the threshold can greet thee, even in its sadness, like
the smile upon they face of the dead. And there, from
thy casement, and there, from without thy door, thou
seest still the tree, solitary as thyself, and springing from
the clefts of the rock, but forcing its way to light, -—as,
through all sorrow, while the seasons yet can renew the
verdure and bloom of youth, strives the instinct of the
human heart! Only when the sap is dried up, only when
age comes on, does the sun shine in vain for man and for
the tree.
Weeks and months—months sad and many—again
passed, and Naples will not longer suffer its idol to seclude
itself from homage. The world ever plucks us back from
ourselves with a thousand arms. And again Viola’s
Voice is heard upon the stage, which, mystically faithful
to life, is in nought more faithful than this, that it is the
appearances that ﬁll the scene; and we pause not to ask
of what realities they are the proxies. When the actor
of Athens moved all hearts as he clasped the burial-urn,
and burst into broken sobs ; how few, there, knew that it
held the ashes of his son! Gold, as well as fame, was
showered upon the young actress; but she still kept to
her simple mode of life, to her lowly home, to the one
servant, whose faults, selﬁsh as they were, Viola was too
inexperienced to perceive. And it was Gionetta who had
placed her, when ﬁrst born, in her father’s arms! She
was surrounded by every snare, wooed by every solicita-

tion that could beset her unguarded beauty and her dan-
gerous calling. But her modest virtue passed unsullied
through them all. It is true that she had been taught by
lips now mute the maiden duties enjoined by honor and re-
ligion. And alllove that spoke not ofthe altar only shocked
and repelled her. But besides that, as grief and solitude
ripened her heart, and made her tremble at times to think
how deeply it could feel, her vague and early visions
shaped themselves into an ideal of love. And till the
ideal is found, how the shadow that it throws before it
chills us to the actual I With that idea], ever and ever,
unconsciously, and with a certain awe and shrinking, came
the shape and voice of the warning stranger. Nearly two
years had passed since he had appeared at Naples. No-
thing had been heard of him, save that his vessel had been
directed, some months after his departure, to sail for Leg-
horn. By the gossips of Naples, his existence, supposed
so extraordinary, was well-nigh forgotten ; but the heart
of Viola was more faithful. Often he glided through her
dreams, and when the wind sighed through that fantastic
tree, associated with his remembrance, she started with
a tremor and a blush, as if she had heard him speak.
But amongst the train of her suitors was one to whom
she listened more gently than to the rest; partly because,
perhaps, he spoke in her mother’s native tongue, partly
because in his diﬁidence there was little to alarm and
displease; partly because his rank, nearer to her own
than that of lordlier wooers, prevented his admiration
from appearing insult; partly because he himself, eloquent
and a dreamer, often uttered thoughts that were kindred

to those buried deepest in her mind. She began to like

privileged familiarity sprung up between them. If, in
the Englishman’s breast, arose wild and unworthy hopes,
'he had not yet expressed them. Is there danger to thee
here, lone Viola? or is the danger greater in thy unfound
ideal?
And now, as the overture to some strange and wizard

With orange-woods and myrtles,— speaks, and lo!

ART, LOVE, AND WONDER.
CHAPTER I.
Centauri, e Sﬁngi, e pallide Gorgoni.*
GER. LIB., 0. iv. v.
ONE moon-lit night, in the Gardens at Naples, some
four or ﬁve gentlemen were seated under a tree, drinking
their sherbet, and listening, in the intervals of conversa-
tion, to the music which enlivened that gay and favorite
resort of an indolent population. One of this little party
was ayoung Englishman, who had been the life of the
whole group, but who, for the last few moments, had
sunk into ‘a gloomy and abstracted reverie. One of his
countrymen observed this sudden gloom, and, tapping
him on the back, said, “ What ails you, Glyndon ? Are
you ill? You have grown quite pale—you tremble.
Is it a sudden chill? You had better go home: these
Italian nights are often dangerous to our English con-
stitutions.”

“NO, I am well now; it was a passing shudder. I
cannot account for it myself.”
A man, apparently of about thirty years of age, and
of a mien and countenance strikingly superior to those
around him, turned abruptly, and looked steadfastly at
Glyndon.
“ I think I understand what you mean,” said he ; “and
perhaps,” he added, with a grave smile, “ I-could explain
it better than yourself.” Here, turning to the others, he
added, “You must often have felt, gentlemen, each and
all of you, especially when sitting alone at night, a strange
and unaccountable sensation of coldness and awe creep
over you; your blood curdles, and the heart stands still:
the limbs shiver, the hair bristles; you are afraid to look
up, to turn your eyes to the darker corners of the room;
you have a horrible fancy that something unearthly is at
hand; presently the whole spell, if I may so call it, passes
away, and you are ready to laugh at your own weakness.
Have you not often felt what I have thus imperfectly
described? if so, you can understand what our young
friend has just experienced, even amidst the delights of
this magical scene, and amidst the balmy whispers of a
July night.”
“ Sir,” replied Glyndon, evidently much surprised, “ you
have deﬁned exactly the nature of that shudder which
came 0v or me. But how could my manner be so faithful
an index to my impressions?”
“I 'know the signs of the visitation,” returned the

stranger, gravely; “they are not to be mistaken by one
of my experience.”
All the gentlemen present then declared that they could
comprehend, and had felt, what the stranger had de-
scribed.
“According to one of our national superstitions,” said
Mervale, the Englishman who had ﬁrst addressed Glyn-
don, “ the moment you so feel your blood creep, and your
hair stand on end, some one is walking over the spot
which shall be your grave.”
“There are in all lands different superstitions to ac-
count for so common an occurrence,” replied the stranger:
“ one sect among the Arabians holds that at that instant
God is deciding the hour either of your death, or of some
one dear to you. The African savage, whose imagination
is darkened by the hideous rites of his gloomy idolatry,
believes that the Evil Spirit is pulling you towards him
by the hair : so do the Grotesque and the Terrible mingle
with each other.”
“ It is evidently a mere physical accident—a derange-
ment of the stomach—a chill of the blood,” said a young
Neapolitan, with whom Glyndon had formed a slight ac-
quaintance.
“ Then why is it always coupled in all nations with
some superstitious presentiment 0r terror—some connec-
tion between the material frame and the supposed world
without us? For my part, I think ”
“Ay, what do you think, sir ?” asked Glyndon, curi
ously.

“ I think,” continued the stranger, “ that it is the re-
pugnance and horror with which our more human ele-
ments recoil from something; indeed, invisible, but anti-
pathetic to our own nature; and from a knowledge of
which we are happily secured by the imperfection of our
senses.”
“You are a believer in spirits, then?” said Mervale,
With an incredulous smile.
“ Nay, it was not precisely of spirits that I spoke ; but
there may be forms of matter as invisible and impalpable
to us as the animalculae in the air we breathe—in the
water that plays in yonder basin. ' Such beings may have
passions and powers like our own,-—as the animalculae to
which I have compared them. The monster that lives
and dies in a drop of water—carnivorous, insatiable, sub-
sisting on the creatures minuter than himself—is not less
deadly in his wrath, less ferocious in his nature, than the
tiger of the desert. There may be things around us that
would be dangerous and hostile to men, if Providence had
not placed a wall between them and us, merely by diﬁ'er-'
ent modiﬁcations of matter.”
“And think you that wall never can be removed ?”
asked young Glyndon, abruptly. "Are the traditions of
sorcerer and wizard, universal and immemorial as they
are, merely fables?”
“Perhaps yes— perhaps no,” answered the stranger,
indiﬁerently. “But who, in an age in which the reason
has chosen its proper bounds, would be mad enough to
break the partition that divides him from the boa and the

lion—to repine at and rebel against the law which con-
ﬁnes the shark to the great deep ‘? Enough of these idle
speculations.”
Here the stranger rose, summoned the attendant, paid
for his sherbet, and, bowing slightly to the company, soon
disappeared among the trees.
“Who is that gentleman?” asked Glyndon, eagerly.
The rest looked at each other, without replying, for
some moments.
“I never saw him before,” said Mervale, at last.
“ Nor I.’
“ Nor I.”
“ I know him well,” said the Neapolitan, who was, in-
deed, the Count Cetoxa. “If you remember, it was as
my companion that he joined you. He visited Naples
about two years ago, and has recently returned; he is
very rich—indeed, enormously so. A most agreeable
person. I am sorry to hear him talk so strangely to-
night; it serves to encourage the various foolish reports
'that are circulated concerning him.”
“And surely,” said another Neapolitan, “the circum-
stance that occurred but the other day, so well known to
yourself, Cetoxa, justiﬁes the reports you pretend to de-
precate.”
“ Myself and my countryman,” said Glyndon, “ mix so
little in Neapolitan society, that we lose much that ap-
pears well worthy of lively interest. May I inquire what
are the reports, and what is the circumstance you refer
to 't’"

“As to the reports, gentlemen,” said Getoxa, cour‘
teously addressing himself to the two Englishmen, “it
may sufﬁce to observe, that they attribute to the Signor
Zanoni certain qualities which everybody desires for him-
self, but damns any one else for possessing. The inci-
dent Signor Belgioso alludes to, illustrates these qualities,
and is, I must own, somewhat startling. You probably
play, gentlemen?” (Here Oetoxa paused; and, as both
Englishmen had occasionally staked a few scudi at the
public gaming-tables, they bowed assent to the conjec-
ture.) Cetoxa continued: “ Well, then, not many days
since, and on the very day that Zanoni returned to Naples,
it so happened that I had been playing pretty high, and
had lost considerably. I rose from the table, resolved
no longer to tempt fortune, when I suddenly perceived
Zanoni, whose acquaintance I had before made (and who,
I may say, was under some slight obligation to me), stand '
ing by, a spectator. Ere I could express my gratiﬁcation
at this unexpected recognition, he laid his hand on my
arm. ‘You have lost much,’ said he; ‘more than you
can aﬁ'ord. For my part, I dislike play ; yet I wish to
have some interest in what is going on. Will you play
this sum for me? the risk is mine—the half proﬁts yours.’
I was startled, as you may suppose, at such an address;
but Zanoni had an air and tone with him it was impos-
sible to resist; besides, I was burning to recover my
losses, and should not have risen had I had any money
left about me. I told him I would accept his offer, pro-
vided we shared the risk as well as proﬁts. ‘As you will,’

said he, smiling; ‘ we need have no scruple, for you will
be sure to win.’ I sat down; Zanoni stood behind me;
my luck rose; I invariably won. In fact, I rose from
the table a rich man.”
“There can be no foul play at the public tables, es-
pecially when foul play would make against the bank ? ”
This question was put by Glyndon.
“ Certainly not,” replied the count. “But our good
fortune was, indeed, marvellous—so extraordinary, that
a Sicilian (the Sicilians are all ill-bred, bad-tempered
fellows) grew angry and insolent. ‘Sir,’ said be, turning
to my new friend, ‘ you have no business to stand so near
to the table. I do not understand this; you have not
acted fairly.’ Zanoni replied, with great composure, that
he had done nothing against the rules—that he was very
sorry that one man could not win without another man
losing; and that he could not act unfairly, even if dis-
posed to do so. The Sicilian took the stranger’s mild-
ness for apprehension, and blustered more loudly. In
fact, he rose from the table, and confronted Zanoni in a
manner that, to say the least of it, was provoking to any
gentleman who has some quickness of temper, or some
skill with the small-sword.”
“And,” interrupted Belgioso, “the most singular part
of the whole to me was, that this Zanoni, who stood op-
posite to where I sat, and whose face I distinctly saw,
made no remark, showed no resentment. He ﬁxed his
eye steadfastly on the Sicilian; never shall I forget that
look I it is impossible to describe it: it froze the blood in

my veins. The Sicilian staggered back, as if struck. I
saw him tremble; he sank on the bench. And then ”

“Yes, then,” said Cetoxa, “to my inﬁnite surprise, our
gentleman, thus disarmed by a look from Zanoni, turned
his whole anger upon me—the—but perhaps you do
not know, gentlemen, that I have some repute with my
weapon T ”
“The best swords-man in Italy,” said Belgioso.
“Before I could guess why or wherefore,” resumed»
Cetoxa, “I found myself in the garden behind the house,
with Ughelli (that was the Sicilian’s name) facing me,
and ﬁve or six gentlemen, the witnesses of the duel about
to take place, around. Zanoni beckoned me aside. ‘ This
man will fall,’ said he. ‘ When he is on the ground, go
to him, and ask whether he will be buried by the side of
his father in the church of San Gennaro ?’ ‘Do you
then know his family?’ I asked, with great surprise.
Zanoni made me no answer, and the next moment I was
engaged with the Sicilian. To do him justice, his im-
brogliato was magniﬁcent, and a swifter lounger never
crossed a sword; nevertheless,” added Cetoxa, with a
pleasing modesty, “ he was run through the body. I went
up to him ; he could scarcely speak. ‘ Have you any re-
quest to make—any affairs to settle?’ He shook his
head. ‘Where would you wish to be interred?’ He
pointed towards the Sicilian coast. ‘ What l’ said I, in
surprise, ‘ not by the side of your father, in the church of
San Gennaro ?’ As I spoke, his face altered terribly—

month, and he fell dead. The most strange part of the
story is to come. We buried him in the church of San
Gennaro. In doing so, we took up his father’s coﬂin;
the lid came off in moving it, and the skeleton was visible.
In the hollow of the skull we found a very slender wire
of sharp steel: this caused surprise and inquiry. The
Father, who was rich, and a miser, had died suddenly, and
been buried in haste, owing, it was said, to the heat of
the weather. Suspicion once awakened, the examination
became minute. ' The old man’s servant was questioned,
and at last confessed that the son had murdered the sire :
the contrivance was ingenious: the wire was so slender,
that it pierced to the brain, and drew but one drop of
blood, which the grey hairs concealed. The accomplice
will be executed.” \
“And Zanoni—did he give evidence ? did he account
for ”
“No,” interrupted the count: “he declared that he
had by accident visited the church that morning; that
he had observed the tomb-stone of the Count Ughelli;
that his guide had told him the count’s son was in Naples

_._a spendthrift and a gambler. While we were at play,
he had heard the count mentioned by name at the table;
and when the challenge was given and accepted, it had
Occurred to him to name the place of burial, by an in-
stinct which be either could not or would not account
for.”
“A very lame story,” said Mervale.
“ Yes! but we Italians are superstitious ;—the alleged

instinct was regarded by many as the whisper of Provi-
deuce. The next day the stranger became an object of
universal interest and‘curiosity. His wealth, his manner
of living, his extraordinary personal beauty, have assisted
also to make him the rage; besides, I have had pleasure
in introducing so eminent a person to our gayest cava-
liers and our fairest ladies.”
“A most interesting narrative,” said Mervale, rising.
“Come, Glyndon ; shall we seek our hotel ?-It is almost
daylight. Adieu, signor 1”
“What think you of this story?” said Glyndon, as the
young men walked homeward.
“ Why, it is very clear that this Zanoni is some im-
pastor—some clever rogue; and the Neapolitan shares
the booty, and puffs him off with all the hackneyed
charlatanism of the marvellous. An unknown adventurer
gets into society by being made an object of awe and
curiosity ; _-he is more than ordinarily handsome ; and
the women are quite content to receive him without any
other recommendation than his own face and Cetoxa’s
fables. ”
“I cannot agree with you. Cetoxa, though a gambler
and a rake, is a nobleman of birth and high repute for
courage and honor. Besides, this stranger, with his noble
presence, and lofty air—so calm— so unobtrusive — has
nothing in common with the forward garrulity of an im-
poster.”

of the trade. But to change the subject—how advances
the love affair?”
“Oh, Viola could not see me to-day.”
“You must not marry her. What would they all say
at home ?”
“ Let us enjoy the present, ” said Glyndon, with vivacity;
“ we are young, rich, good-looking: let us not think of
to-morrow.” '
“Bravo, Glyndon 1 Here we are at the hotel. Sleep

CLARENCE (humor: was a young man of fortune, not
large but easy and independent. His parents were dead,
and his nearest relation was an only sister, left in England
under the care of her aunt, and many years younger than
himself. Early in life he had evinced considerable promise
in the art of painting, and rather from enthusiasm than
any pecuniary necessity for a profession, he determined to
devote himself to a career in which the English artist

sitlon, to conclude with avaricious calculation and por-
traits of Alderman Simpkins. Glyndon was supposed by
his friends to possess no inconsiderable genius; but it -
was of a rash and presumptuous order. He was averse
from continuous and steady labor, and his ambition rather
sought to gather the fruit than to plant the tree. In
common with many artists in their youth, he was fond of
pleasure and excitement, yielding with little forethought
to whatever impressed his fancy or appealed to his pas-
sions. He had travelled through the more celebrated
cities of Europe, with the avowed purpose and sincere
resolution of studying the divine master-pieces of his art.
But in each, pleasure had too often allured him from am-
bition, and living beauty distracted his worship from the
senseless canvas. Brave, adventurous, vain, restless, in-
quisitive, he was ever involved in wild projects and pleas-
ant dangers—the creature of impulse and the slave of
imagination.
It was then the period, when a feverish spirit of change
was working its way to that hideous mockery of human
aspirations, the Revolution of France. And from the
chaos into which were already jarring the sanctities of the
World’s Venerable Belief, arose many shapeless and un-
formed chimeras. Need I remind the reader, that while
that wa the day for polished skepticism and affected wis-
dom. it was the day also for the most egregious credulity
and the most mystical superstitions, -—the day in which

ples of Diderot,-when prophecies were current in every

mouth,—when the salon of a philosophical deist was con-
verted into an Heraclea, in which necromancy professed
to conjure up the shadows of the dead—when the Crozier
and the Book were ridiculed, and Mesmer and Cagliostro
were believed. In that Heliacal Rising heralding the new
sun before which all vapors were to vanish, stalked from
their graves in the feudal ages all the phantoms that had
ﬂitted before the eyes of Paracelsus and Agrippa. Daz—
zled by the dawn of the Revolution, Glyndon was yet
more attracted by its strange accompaniments, and natu-
ral it was with him, as with others, that the fancy which
ran riot amidst the hopes of a social Utopia, should grasp
with avidity all that promised, out of the dusty tracks of
the beaten science, the bold discoveries of some marvel-
lous Elysium.
In his travels, he had listened with vivid interest, at
least, if not with implicit belief, to the wonders told of
each more renowned Ghost-seer, and his mind was there-
fore prepared for the impression which the mysterious
Zanoni at ﬁrst sight had produced upon it.
There might be another cause for this disposition to
credulity. A remote ancestor of Glyndon’s, 0n the mo-
ther’s side, had achieved no inconsiderable reputation as
a philosopher and alchemist. Strange stories were aﬂoat
concerning this wise progenitor. He was said to have
lived to an age far exceeding the allotted boundaries of
mortal existence, and to have preserved to the last the
appearance of middle life. He had died at length, it was
supposed of grief for the sudden death of a great-grand-

child, the only creature he had ever appeared to love
The works of this philosopher, though rare, were extant,
and found in the library of Glyndon’s home. Their Pla-
tonic mysticism, their bold assertions, the high promises
that might be detected through their ﬁgurative and typi-
cal phraseology, had early made a deep impression on the
young imagination of Clarence Glyndon. His parents.
not alive to the consequences of encouraging fancies which
the very enlightenment of the age appeared to them suf-
ﬁcient to prevent or dispel, were fond, in the long winter
nights, of conversing on the traditional history of this dis-
tinguished progenitor. And Clarence thrilled with a
fearful pleasure when his mother playfully detected a
striking likeness between the features of the young heir
and the faded portrait of the alchemist that overhung
their mantel-piece, and was the boast of their household
and the admiration of their friends :——The child is, indeed,
more often than we think for, “the father of the man. ”
I have said that Glyndou was fond of pleasure. Facile,
as genius ever must be, to cheerful impression, his care-
less Artist-life, ere Artist-life settles down to labor, had
wandered from ﬂower to ﬂower. He had enjoyed, almost
to the reaction of satiety, the gay revelries of Naples,
when he fell in love with the face and voice of Viola Pi-
sani. But his love, like his ambition, was vague and
desultory. It did not satisfy his whole heart and ﬁll up
his whole nature; not from want of strong and noble
passions, but because his mind was not yet matured and
settled enough for their development. As there is one

season for the blossom, another for the fruit; so it is not
till the bloom of fancy begins to fade, that the heart ripens
to the passions that the bloom precedes and foretells.
Joyous alike at his lonely easel or amidst his boon com-
panions, he had not yet known enough of sorrow to love
deeply. For man must be disappointed with the lesser
things of life before no can comprehend the full value of
the greatest. It is the shallow sensualists of France, who,
in their salon-language, call love “ a folly; ”-L0ve, bet-
ter understood, is wisdom. Besides, the world was too
much with Clarence Glyndon. His ambition of art was
associated with the applause and estimation of that mise-
rable minority of the Surface that we call the Public.
Like those who deceive, he was ever fearful of being
himself the dupe. He distrusted the sweet innocence of
Viola. He could not venture the hazard of seriously
proposing marriage to an Italian actress ; but the modest
dignity of the girl, and something good and generous in
his own nature, had hitherto made him shrink from any
more worldly but less honorable designs. Thus the fami—
liarity between them seemed rather that of kindness and
regard than passion. He attended the theatre; he stole
behind the scenes to converse with her; be ﬁlled his port-
folio with countless sketches of a beauty that charmed
him as an artist as well as lover. And day after day he
ﬂoated on through a changing sea of doubt and irrcsolu-
tion, of affection and distrust. The last, indeed, constantly
sustained against his better reason, by the sober admo-
nitions of Mervale, a matter-of-fact manl

The day following that eve on which this section of
my story opens, Glyndon was riding alone by the shores
of/the Neapolitan sea, on the other side of the Cavern
0f Posilipo. It was past noon; the sun had lost its early
fervor, and a cool breeze sprung up voluptuously from
the sparkling sea. Bending over a fragment of stone
near the road-side, he perceived the form of a man and
when he approached, he recognized Zanoni.
The Englishman saluted him courteously. “ Have you
discovered some antique ?” said he, with a smile; “ they
are common as pebbles on this road.”
“ No,” replied Zanoni; “it was but one of those an-
tiques that have their date, indeed,lfrom the beginning
of the world, but which Nature eternally withers and
renews.” So saying, he showed Glyndon-a small herb,
with a pale blue ﬂower, and then placed it carefully in
his bosom. ‘
“You are an herbalist?”
“ I am.”
“It is, I am told, a study full of interest."
“To those who understand it, doubtless.”
“Is the knowledge, then, so rare?”
“Rare! The deeper knowledge is perhaps rather,
among the arts, lost to the modern philosophy of common-

of the powers that may be extracted from the germ and

this talk,” said Zanoni, checking himself abruptly, and
with a cold smile, “serves only to waste your time and
my own.” He paused, looked steadily at Glyndon, and
continued—“ Young man, think you that vague curiosity
will supply the- place of earnest labor? I read your
heart. You wish to know me, and not this humble herb:
but pass on; your desire cannot be satisfied.”

said Glyndon, somewhat discomposed. “ Suppose I were
desirous to cultivate your acquaintance, why should you
reject my advances?”
“I reject no man’s advances,” answered Zanoni; “I
must know them if they so desire; but me, in return,
they can never comprehend. If you ask my acquaintance,
it is yours; but I would warn you to shun me.”
“And why are you, then, so dangerous?”
“On this earth, men are often, without their own
agency, fated to be dangerous to others. If I Were to
predict your fortune by the vain calculations of the as-
trologer, I should tell you, in their despicable jargon,
that my planet sat darkly in your house of life. Cross
me not, if you can avoid it. I warn you now for the ﬁrst
time and last.”
“You despise the astrologers, yet you utter a jargon
as mysterious as theirs. I neither gamble nor quarrel;
why, then, should I fear you?”
“As you will; I have done.”
“ Let me speak frankly-your conversation last night
interested and perplexed me.”
“ I know it : minds like yours are attracted by mystery.”
Glyndou was piqued at these words, though in the tone
in which they were spoken there was no contempt.
“ I see you do not consider me worthy of your friend-
ship. Be it so. Good day!” .
Zanoni coldly replied to the salutation; and, as the
Englishman rode on, returned to his botanical employ-

The same night, Glyndon went, as usual, to the theatre.
He was standing behind the scenes watching Viola, who
was on the stage in one of her most brilliant parts. The
house resounded with applause. Glyndon was transported
with a young man’s passion and a young man’s pride:
--“ This glorious creature,” thought he, “may yet be
mine.”
He felt, while thus wrapt in delicious reverie, a slight
touch upon his shoulder: he turned, and beheld Zanoni.
“ You are in danger,” said the latter. “Do not walk
home to-night; or if you do, go not alone.”
Before Glyndon recovered from his surprise, Zanoni
disappeared; and when the Englishman saw him again,
he was in the box of one of the Neapolitan nobles, where
Glyndon could not follow him.
Viola now left the stage, and Glyndon accosted her
with an unaccustomed warmth of gallantry. But Viola,
contrary to her gentle habit, turned with an evident impa-
tience from the address of her lover. Taking aside
Gionetta, who was her constant attendant at the theatre,
she said, in an earnest whisper,—
“Oh, Gionettal He is here againl—the stranger
of whom I spoke to thee l—and again, he alone, of the
whole theatre, withholds from me his applause.”
“ Which is he, my darling?" said the old woman, with
fondness in her voice. “He must indeed be dull—not
worth a thought.” '
The actress drew Gionetta nearer to the stage, and
pointed out to her a man in one of the boxes, conspicuous

amongst all else by the simplicity of his dress, and the
extraordinary beauty of his features.
“ Not worth a thought, Gionetta l” repeated Viola—-
“ not worth a'thought l Alas, not to think of him, seems
the absence of thought itself!”
The prompter summoned the Signora Pisani. “Find
out his name, Gionetta,” said she, moving slowly to the
stage, and passing by Glyndon, who gazed at her with a
look of sorrowful reproach.
The scene on which the actress now entered was that
of the ﬁnal catastrophe, wherein all her remarkable powers
of voice and art were pre-eminently called forth. The
house hung on every word with breathless worship; but
the eyes of Viola sought only those of one calm and un-
moved spectator: she exerted herself as if inspired. Zanoni
listened, and observed her with an attentive gaze, but no
approval escaped his lips; no emotion changed the expres-
sion of his cold and half-disdainful aspect. Viola, who was
in the character of one who loved, but without return, never
felt so acutely the part she played. Her tears were truth-
ful; it was almost too terrible to behold. She was borne
from the stage exhausted and insensible, amidst such a
tempest of admiring rapture as continental audiences
alone can raise. The crowd stood up—handkerchiefs
waved—garlands and ﬂowers were thrown on the stage
-—men wiped their eyes, and women sobbed aloud.
“ By heavens I” said a Neapolitan of great rank, “she
has ﬁred me beyond endurance. To-night, this very night,
she shall be mine 1 You have arranged all, Mascari ? ”

“All, Signor. And the young Englishman f”
“The presuming barbarian! As I before told thee,
let him bleed for his folly. I will have no rival.”
“But an Englishman l There is always a search after
the bodies of the English.
“ Fool l is not the sea deep enough, or the earth secret
enough to hide one dead man? Our ruﬂians are silent
as the grave itself:_and I 1— who would dare to suspect,
to arraign the Prince di——? See to it—this night.
I trust him to you :—robbers murder him—you under-
stand ; —the country swarms with them ; —plunder and
strip him, the better to favor such report. Take three
men; the rest shall be my escort.”
Mascari shrugged his shoulders, and bowed submissively.
The streets of Naples were not then so safe as now,
and carriages were both less expensive and more neces-
sary. The vehicle which was regularly engaged by the
young actress was not to be found. Gionetta, too aware
of the beauty of her mistress and the number of her
admirers to contemplate without alarm the idea of their
return on foot, communicated her distress to Glyndon,
and he besought Viola, who recovered but slowly, to
accept his own carriage. Perhaps before that night she
would not have rejected so slight a service. Now, for
some reason or other, she refused. Glyndon, offended,
was retiring sullenly, when Gionetta stopped him. “ Stay,
Signor,” said she coaxingly; “the dear Signora is not
well—do not be angry with her; I will make her accept
your offer”

Glyndon stayed, and after a few moments spent in
expostulation on the part of Gionetta, and resistance or:
that of Viola, the offer was accepted. Gionetta and her
charge entered the carriage, and Glyndon was left at the
door of the theatre to return home on foot. The mys_
terious warning of Zanoni then suddenly occurred to him ;
he had forgotten it in the interest of his lover’s quarrel
with Viola. He thought it now advisable to guard against
danger foretold by lips so mysterious: he looked around
for some one he knew; the theatre was disgorging its
crowds; they hustled, and jostled, and pressed upon him;
but he recognized no familiar countenance. While pausing
irresolute, he heard Mervale’s voice calling on him, and,
to his great relief, discovered his friend making his way
through the throng.
“ I have secured you,” said he, “ a place in the Count
Cetoxa’s carriage. Come along, he is waiting for us.”
“How kind in you i how did you ﬁnd me out?”
“I met Zanoni in the passage -‘ Your friend is at the
door of the theatre,’ said he; ‘do not let him go home
on foot to-night; the streets of Naples are not always
safe.’ I immediately remembered that some of the Cala~
brian bravos had been busy within the city the last few
weeks, and suddenly meeting Cetoxa—but here he is.”
Further explanation was forbidden, for they now joined
the count. As Glyndon entered the carriage and drew
up the glass, he saw four men standing apart by the
pavement, who seemed to eye him with attention.
“Cospetto I” cried one, “that is the Englishman!”

Glyndon imperfectly heard the exclamation as the carriage
drove on. He reached home in safety.
The familiar and endearing intimacy which always
exists in Italy between the nurse and the child she has"
reared, and which the “ Romeo and Juliet” of Shakspeare
in no way exaggerates, could not but be drawn yet closer
than usual, in a situation so friendless as that of the
orphan-actress. In all that concerned the weaknesses of
the heart, Gionetta had large experience; and when,
three nights before, Viola, on returning from the theatre,
had wept bitterly, the nurse had succeeded in extracting
from her a confession that she had seen one—not seen
for two weary and eventful years — but never forgotten,
and who, alas, had not evinced the slightest recognition
of herself. Gionetta could not comprehend all the vague
and innocent emotions that swelled this sorrow; but she
resolved them all, with her plain, blunt understanding, to
the one sentiment of love. And here, she was well ﬁtted
to sympathize and console. Conﬁdante to Viola’s entire
and deep heart 'she never could be—for that heart never
could have words for all its secrets. But such conﬁdence
as she could obtain, she was ready to repay by the most
unreproving pity and the most ready service.
“ Have you discovered who he is?” asked Viola, as
she was now alone in the carriage with Gionetta.
“Yes; he is the celebrated Signor Zanoni, about whom
all the great ladies have gone mad. They say he is so
rich l—oh 1 so much richer than any of the Inglesi l—not
but what the Signor Glyndon ”

“Cease l” interrupted the young actress. “Zanouil
Speak of the Englishman no more."
The carriage was now entering that more lonely and
remote part of the city in which Viola’s house was sun-
I ated, when it suddenly stopped.
Gionetta, in alarm, thrust her head out of the window,
and perceived, by the pale light of the moon, that the
driver, torn from his seat, was already pinioned in the
arms of two men : the next moment the door was opened
violently, and a tall ﬁgure, masked and mantled, appeared.
“ Fear not, fairest Pisani,” said he, gently, “no ill shall
befall you.” As he spoke, he wound his arm round the
form of the fair actress, and endeavored to lift her from
the carriage. But Gionetta was no ordinary ally—she
thrust back the assailant with a force that astonished him,
and followed the shock by a volley of the most energetic
reprobation.
The mask drew hack, and composed his “disordered
mantle.
“By the body of Bacchus l” said he, half laughing,
“she is well protected. Here, Luigi— Giovannil seize
the hagl—quick 1 --why loiter ye?”
The mask retired from the door, and another and yet
taller form presented itself. “Be calm, Viola Pisani,”
said he, in a low voice; “ with me you are indeed safe 1 ”
He lifted his mask as he spoke, and showed the noble
features of Zanoni.
“ Be calm, be hushed,-I can save you.” He vanished,
leaving Viola lost in surprise, agitation, and delight.

There Were, in all, nine masks: two were engaged with
the driver; one stood at the head of the carriage-horses;
a fourth guarded the well-trained steeds of the party;
three others (besides Zanoni and the one who had ﬁrst
accosted Viola) stood apart by a carriage drawn to the '
side of the road. To these three Zanoni motioned: they
advanced; he pointed towards the ﬁrst mask, who was in
fact the Prince di
ment, the Prince was suddenly seized from behind.

, and to his unspeakable astonish-
“Treason l ” he cried. “ Treason among my own men!
What means this?” ‘
Place him in his carriage! If he resist, his blood be
on his own head i” said Zanoni, calmly.
He approached the men who had detained the coach-
man.
“You are outnumbered and outwitted,” said he: “join
your lord; you are three men—we six, armed to the
teeth. Thank our mercy that we spare your lives—Go l ”
The men gave way, dismayed. The driver remounted.
“Cut the traces of their carriage and the bridles of
their horses,” said Zanoni, as he entered the vehicle con-
taining Viola, which now drove on rapidly, leaving the
discomﬁted ravisher in a state of rage and stupor in
possible to describe.
“Allow me to explain this mystery to you,” said Za-
noni. “I discovered the plot against you—no matter
how; I frustrated it thus :—The head of this design is a
nobleman, who has long persecuted you in vain. He and

the spot where you were attacked; myself and ﬁve of my
servahts supplied their place, and were mistaken for his
own followers. I had previously ridden alone to the spot
where the men were waiting, and informed them that their
master would not require their services that night. They
believed me, and accordingly dispersed. I then joined
my own band, whom I had left in the rear; you know all.
We are at your door.”

ZANONI followed the young Neapolitan into her house:
Gionetta vanished—they were left alone.
Alone, in that room so often ﬁlled, in the old happy
days, with the wild melodies of Pisani; and now, as she
saw this mysterious, haunting, yet beautiful and stately
stranger, standing on the very spot where she had sat at
her father’s feet, thrilled and spell-bound—she almost
thought, in her fantastic way of personifying her own airy
notions, that that spiritual Music had taken shape and life,
and stood before her glorious in the image it assumed.
She was unconscious all the while of her own loveliness.
She had thrown aside her hood and veil; her hair, some-

what disordered, fell over the ivory neck which the dress
partially displayed; and, as her dark eyes swam with
grateful tears, and her cheek ﬂushed with its late excite-
ment, the god of light and music himself never, amidst his
Arcadian valleys, wooed, in his mortal guise, maiden or
nymph more fair.
Zanoni gazed at her with a look in which admiration
seemed not unmingled with compassion. He muttered a
few words to himself, and then addressed her aloud.
“ Viola, I have saved you from a great peril; not from
dishonor only, but, perhaps, from death. The Prince
di
is a man above the law. He is capable of every crime ;

, under a weak despot and a venal administration,
but amongst his passions he has such prudence as belongs
to ambition; if you were not to reconcile yourself to
your shame, you would never enter the world again to
tell your tale. The ravisher has no heart for repentance,
but he has a hand that can murder. I have saved you,
Viola. Perhaps you would ask me wherefore Y ” Zanoni
paused, and smiled mournfully, as he added, “ You will
not wrong me by the thought that he who has preserved
is not less selﬁsh than he who would have injured. Orphan,
I do not speak to you in the language of your wooers;
enough that I know pity, and am not ungrateful for
aﬁection. Why blush, why tremble at the word ? I read
your heart while I speak, and I see not one thought that
should give you shame. I say not that you love me yet;
happily, the fancy may be roused long before the heart
is touched. But it has been my fate to fascinate your

eye, to inﬂuence your imagination It is to warn you
against what could bring you but sorrow, as I warned
you once to prepare for sorrow itself, that I am now your
guest. The Englishman, Glyndon, loves thee well-
better, perhaps, than I can ever love: if not worthy of
thee yet, he has but to know thee more to deserve thee
better. He may wed thee, he may bear thee to his own
free and happy land, the land of thy mother’s kin. For-
get me; teach thyself to return and deserve his love ; and
I tell thee that thou wilt be honored and happy.”
Viola listened with silent, inexpressible emotion, and
burning blushes, to this strange address, and when he had
concluded, she covered her face with her hands,-and wept.
And yet, much as his words were calculated to humble
0r irritate, to produce indignation or excite shame, those
were not the feelings with which her eyes streamed and her
heart swelled. The woman at that moment was lost in
the child: and as a child with all its exacting, craving,
yet innocent desire to be loved, weeps in unrebuking
sadness when its affection is thrown austerely back upon
itself—s0, without anger and without shame, wept Viola.
Zanoni contemplated her thus, as her graceful head,
shadowed by its redundant tresses, bent before him ; and
after a moment’s pause he drew near to her, and said, in
a voice of the most soothing sweetness, and with a half
smile upon his lip-—
“Do you remember, when I told you to struggle for
the light, that I pointed for example to the resolute and
earnest tree: I did not tell you, fair child, to take exam-

ple by the moth, that would soar to the star, but falls
scorched beside the lamp. Come, I will talk to thee.
This Englishman ”
Viola drew herself away, and wept yet more passion-
ately.

“ This Englishman is of thine own years, not far above
thine own rank. Thou mayst share his thoughts in life
—th0u mayst sleep beside him in the same grave in death l
And I, but that view of the future should concern us not.
Look into thy heart, and thou wilt see that till again my
shadow crossed thy path, there had grown up for this
thine equal, a pure and calm aﬁ‘ection that would have
ripened into love. Hast thou never pictured to thyself
a home in which thy partner was thy young wooer?”
“Never!” said Viola, with sudden energy, “ never,
but to feel that such was not the fate ordained me. And,
ohl” she continued, rising suddenly, and putting aside
the tresscs that veiled her face, she ﬁxed her eyes upon
the questioner; “and, oh! whoever thou art that thus
wouldst read my soul and shape my future, do not mistake
the sentiment that, that”- (she falt-ered an instant, and
went on with downcast eyes) “that has fascinated my
thoughts to thee. Do not think that I could nourish a
love nnsought and unreturned. It is not love that I feel
for thee, stranger. Why should I? Thou hast -neVer
spoken to me but to admonish -and now, to wound l ”
Again she paused, again her voice faltered; the tears
trembled on her eye-lids; she brushed them away and
resumed. “ No, not love—if that be love which I have

heard and read of, and sought to simulate on the stage,
-—but a more solemn, fearful, and, it seems to me, almost
preternatural attraction, which makes me associate thee,
waking or dreaming, with images that at once charm and
awe. Thinkest thou, if it were love, that I could speak
to thee thus? that” (she raised her looks suddenly to
his) “mine eyes could thus search and confront thine
own ? Stranger, I ask but at times to see, to hear thee l
Stranger, talk not to me of others. Forewarn, rebuke,
bruise my heart, reject the not unworthy gratitude it offers
thee, if thou wilt, but come not always to me as an omen
of grief and trouble. Sometimes have I seen thee in my
dreams surrounded by shapes of glory and light; thy
looks radiant with a celestial joy which they wear not
now. Stranger, thou hast saved me, and I thank and
bless thee 1 Is that also a homage thou wouldst reject ? ”
With these words, she crossed her arms weekly on her
bosom, and inclined lowlily before him. Nor did her
humility seem unwomanly or abject, nor that of mistress
to lover, of slave to master, but rather of a child to its
guardian, of a neophyte of the old religion to her priest. ‘
Zanoni’s brow was melancholy and thoughtful. He looked
at her with a strange expression of kindness, of sorrow,
yet of tender affection, in his eyes ; but his lips were stern,
and his‘ voice cold, as he replied—-
“Do you know what you ask, Viola? Do you guess
the danger to yourself— perhaps to both of us_which
you court? Do you know that my life, separated from
the turbulent herd of men, is one worship of the Beautiful,

from which 1 seek to banish what the Beautiful inspires
in most? As a calamity, I shun what to man seems the
fairest fate—the love of the daughters of earth. At
present I can warn and save thee from many evils: if I
saw more of thee, would the power still be mine? You
understand me not. What I am about to add, it will be
easier to comprehend. I bid thee banish from thy heart
all thought of me, but as one whom the Future cries
aloud to thee to avoid. Glyndou, if thou acceptest his
homage, will love thee till the tomb closes upon both.
I too,” he added with emotion, “I, too, might love thee l ”
“You 1” cried Viola, with the vehemeuce of a sudden
impulse of delight, of rapture, which she could not sup-
press; but the instant after, she would have given worlds
to recall the exelamation.
“ Yes, Viola, I might love thee; but in that love what
sorrow and what change i The ﬂower gives perfume to
the rock on whose heart it grows. A little while, and
the ﬂower is dead ; but the rock still endures ;—the snow
at its breast—the sunshine on its summit. Pause—think
well. Danger besets thee yet. For some days thou
shalt be safe from thy remorseless persecntor; but the
hour soon comes when thy only security will be in ﬂight.
If the Englishman love thee worthily, thy honor will be
dear to him as his own; if not, there are yet other lands
where love will be truer, and virtue less in danger from
fraud and force. Farewell: my own destiny I cannot
foresee except through cloud and shadow. I know, at
least, that we shall meet again ; but learn ere then, sweet

ﬂower, that there are more genial resting-places than the
rock.”
He turned as he spoke, and gained the outer door
where Gionctta discreetly stood. Zanoni lightly laid his
hand on her arm. With the gay accent of a jesting
cavalier, he said—
“The Signor Glyndon wooes your mistress: he may
wed her. I know your love for her. Disabuse her of
any caprice for me. I am a bird ever on the wing.”
He dropped a purse into Gionetta’s hand as he spoke,
and was gone.

As he entered the rooms reserved for his private hours,
two Indians, in the dress of their country, received him
at the threshold with the grave salutations of the East.
They had accompanied him from the far lands in which,
according to rumor, he had for many years ﬁxed his
home. But they could communicate nothing to gratify
curiosity or justify suspicion. They spoke no language
but their own. With the exception of these two, his
princely retinue was composed of the native hirelings of
the city ; whom his lavish but imperious generosity made
the implicit creatures of his will. In his house, and in
his habits, so far as they were seen, there was nothing to
account for the rumors which were circulated abroad. He
was not, as we are told of Albertus Magnus or the great
Leonardo da Vinci, served by airy forms; and no brazen
image, the invention. of magic mechanism, communicated
to him the inﬂuences of the stars. None of the apparatus
of the alchemist-the crucible, and the metals—gave
solemnity to his chambers, or accounted for his wealth;
' nor did he even seem to interest himself in those serener
studies which might be supposed to color his peculiar
conversation with abstract notions, and often with recon-
dite learning. No books spoke to him in his solitude;
and if ever he had drawn from them his knowledge, it
seemed now that the only page he read was the wide one
of Nature, and that a capacious and startling memory
supplied the rest. Yet was there one exception to what
in all else seemed customary and common-place, and
which, according to the authority we have preﬁxed to

this chapter, might indicate the follower of the occult
sciences. Whether at Rome or Naples, or, in fact, wher-
ever his abode, he selected one room remote from the rest
of the house, which was fastened by a lock scarcely larger
than the seal of a ring, yet which suﬁiced to baﬁ‘le the
most cunning instruments of the locksmith : at least, one
of his servants, prompted by irresistible curiosity, had
made the attempt in vain ; and though he had fancied it
was tried in the most favorable time for secrecy—not a
soul near—in the dead of night—Zanoni himself absent
from home, yet his superstition, or his conscience, told
him the reason why the next day the Major Domo quietly
dismissed him. He compensated himself for this misfor;
tune by spreading his own story, with a- thousand amusing
exaggerations. He declared that, as he approached the
door, invisible hands seemed to pluck him away; and
that when he touched the lock, he was struck as by a
palsy to the ground. One surgeon, who heard the tale,
observed, to the distaste of the wonder-mongers, that
possibly Zanoni made a dexterous use of electricity.
Howbeit, this room once so secured, was never entered
save by Zanoni himself.
The solemn voice of Time, from the neighboring church,
at last aroused the lord of the palace from the deep and
motionless reverie, rather resemblingatrance than thought,
in which his mind was absorbed.
“It is one more sand out of the mighty hour-glass,”
said he, murmuringly, “ and yet time neither adds to, nor
steals from, an atom in the Inﬁnite l- Soul of mine, the

As he thus murmured, one of the earliest birds that sa-
lute the dawn broke into sudden song from amidst the
orange-trees in the garden below his casement; and as
suddenly, song answered song; the mate, awakened at
the note, gave back its happy answer to the bird. He
listened; and not the soul he had questioned, but the
heart replied. He rose, and with restless strides paced the
narrow ﬂoor. “ Away from this world l” he exclaimed
at length, with an impatient tone. “ Can no time loosen
its fatal ties? As the attraction that holds the earth in
space, is the attraction that ﬁxes the soul to earth. Away,

CHAPTER V.
-—-— “I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate.”
The Tempest.
THE next day, Glyndon bent his steps towards Zanoni’s
palace. The young man’s imagination, naturally inﬂam-
mable, was singularly excited by the little he had seen
and heard of this strange being—a spell, he could neither
master nor account for, attracted him towards the stranger.
Zanoni’s power seemed mysterious and great, his motives
kindly and benevolent, yet his manners chilling and repel-
lant. Why at one moment reject Glyndon’s acquaintance,
at another save him from danger? How had Zanoni
thus acquired the knowledge of enemies unknown to Glyn-
don himself? His interest was deeply roused, his grati-
tude appealed to ; he resolved to make another effort to
conciliate the ungracious herbalist.
The signor was at home, and Glyndon was admitted
into a lofty saloon, where in a few moments Zanoni joined
him.
“ I am come to thank you for your warning last night,”
said he, “ and to entreat you to complete my obligation
by informing me of the quarter to which I may look for
enmity and peril.”
“ You are a gallant,” said Zanoni, with a smile, and in

the English language, “and do you know so little of the
south as not to be aware that gallants have always rivals Y ”
“Are you serious?” said Glyndon, coloring.
“ Most serious. You love Viola Pisani; you have for
rival one of the most powerful and relentless of the Nea-
politan princes. Your danger is indeed great.” _
“ But pardon me i—how came it known to you ?”
“I give no account of myself to mortal man,” replied
Zanoni, haughtily ; “ and to me it matters nothing whether
you regard or scorn my warning.”
“Well, if I may not question you, be it so;—but at
least advise me what to do.”
" Would you follow my advice?”
“Why not?”
“Because you are constitutionally brave; you are fond
of excitement and mystery; you like to be the hero of a
romance. ' Were I to advise you to leave Naples, would
you do so while Naples contains a foe to confront, or a
mistress to pursue?”
“You are right,” said the young Englishman, with
energy. “ No l and you cannot reproach me for such a
resolution. ”
“But there is another course left to you: do you love
Viola Pisani truly and fervently? if so, marry her, and
take a bride to your native land.”
“Nay,” answered Glyndon, embarrassed; “Viola is
not of my rank. Her profession, too, is—in short, I am
enslaved by her beauty, but I cannot wed her.”
Zanoni frowned.

“Your love, then, is but selﬁsh lust, and I advise you
to your own happiness no more. Young man, Destiny
is less inexorable than it appears. The resources of the
great Ruler 'of the Universe are not so scanty and so stern
as to deny to men the divine privilege of Free Will; all
of us can carve out our own way, and God can make our
very :ontradictions harmonize with His solemn ends. You
have before you an option. Honorable and generous love
may even now work out your happiness, and effect your
escape; a. frantic and selﬁsh passion will but lead you to
misery and doom.”
“Do you pretend then to read the Future?”
“I have said all that it pleases me to utter.”
“While you assume the moralist to me, Signor Za-
noni,” said Glyndon, with a smile, “are you yourself so
indifferent to youth and beauty, as to act the stoic to its
allurements i”
“If it were necessary that practice square with pre-
cept,” said Zanoni, with a bitter smile, “our monitors
would be but few. The conduct of the individual can
affect but a small circle beyond himself; the permanent
good or evil that he works to others lies rather in the
sentiments he can diffuse. His acts are limited and mo-
mentary; his sentiments may pervade the universe, and
inspire generations till the day of doom. All our virtues,
all our laws, are drawn from books and maxims, which
are sentiments, not from deeds. In conduct, Julian had
the virtues of a Christian, and Constantine the vices of a
Pagan. The sentiments of Julian re-converted thousands

“Who told you that I was an Italian?”
“Are you not? And yet, when I hear you speak my

own language as a native, I ”
“ Tush l” interrupted Zanoni, impatiently turning away.
Then, after a pause, he resumed in a mild voice—“ Glyn-
don, do you renounce Viola Pisani? Will you take some
days to consider what I have said ?"
“ Renounce her- never 1”
“Then you will marry her?”
“Impossible 1”
“Be it so: she will then renounce you. I tell you
that you have rivals.”
“Yes; the Prince di -—-; but I do not fear him.”
“You have another. whom you will fear more ”

Glyndon turned pale, and started from his seat.

me so f”
“Dare! Alasl there are times when I wish that I
could fear.”

These arrogant words were not uttered arrogantly, but
in a tone of the most mournful dejection. Glyndon was
enraged, confounded, and yet awed. However, he had a
brave English heart within his breast, and he recovered
himself quickly.
“ Signor,” said he, calmly, “I am not to be duped by
these solemn phrases and these mystical assumptions.
You may have powers which I cannot comprehend or
emulate, or you may be but a keen impostor.”
“Well, proceed l”
“ I mean, then,” continued Glyndon, resolutely, though
somewhat disconcerted, “I mean you to understand, that,
though I am not to be persuaded or compelled by a
stranger to marry Viola Pisani, I am not the less deter-
mined never tamely to yield her to another.”
Zanoni looked gravely at the young man, whose spark_
ling eyes and heightened color testiﬁed the spirit to sup-
port his words, and replied—“ So bold I well ; it becomes
you. But take my advice: wait yet nine days, and tell
me then if you will marry the fairest and the purest
creature that ever crossed your path.”

become a great and a prosperous man. If, on the con-
trary, she fall to me, I know not what may be her lot;
but I know that there is an ordeal which few can pass,
and which hitherto no woman has survived.”
As Zanoni spoke, his face became colorless, and there
was something in his voice that froze the warm blood of
the listener.
“What is this mystery which surrounds you?” ex-
claimed Glyndon, unable to repress his emotion. “Are
you, in truth, different from other men ? Have you passed
the boundary of lawful knowledge? Are you, as some

declare, a sorcerer, or only a ”
“ Hush l ” interrupted Zanoni, gently, and with a smile
of singular but melancholy sweetness : “have you earned
the right to ask me these questions? Though Italy still
boast an Inquisition, its power is rivelled as a leaf which
the ﬁrst wind shall scatter. The days of torture and
persecution are over; and a man may live as he pleases,
and talk as it suits him, without fear of the stake and the
rack. Since I can defy persecution, pardon me if I do
not yield to curiosity.”
Glyndon blushed, and rose. In spite of his love for
Viola, and his natural terror of such a rival, he felt him-
self irresistibly drawn towards the very man he had most
cause to suspect and dread. He held out his hanl to
Zanoni, saying, “Well, then, if we are to be rivals, our
swords must settle our rights: till then, I would fain be
friends.”
_“Friendsl You know not what you ask.”

“Enigmas l ” cried Zanoni, passionately, “ ay l can you
dare to solve them? Not till then could I give you my
right hand, and call you friend.”
“I could dare everything and all things for the attain-
ment of superhuman wisdom,” said Glyndon; and h1s
countenance was lighted up with wild and intense en-
thusiasm.
Zanoni observed him in- thoughtful silence.

While we hear, every day, the small pretenders to science
talk of the absurdities of Alchemy and the dream of the
Philosopher’s Stone, a more erudite knowledge is aware
that by Alchemists the greatest discoveries in science
have been made, and much which still seems abstruse, had
we the key to the mystic phraseology they were com-
pelled to adopt, might open the way to yet more noble
acquisitions. The Philosopher’s Stone itself has seemed
no visionary chimera to some of the soundest chemists
that even the present century has produced.* Man can-
not contradict the Laws of Nature. But are all the Laws
of Nature yet discovered?
“ Give me a proof of your Art,” says the rational in-
quirer. “ When I have seen the eﬁ'eet, I will endeavor,
with you, to ascertain the causes.”
Somewhat to the above effect were the ﬁrst thoughts
of Clarence Glyndon on quitting Zanoni. But Clarence
Glyndon was no “rational inquirer.” The more vague
and mysterious the language of Zanoni, the more it im-
posed upon him. A proof would have been something
tangible, with which he would have sought to grapple.
And it would have only disappointed his curiosity to ﬁnd
the supernatural reduced to Nature. He endeavored, in

more recent than those to which Glyndon’s thoughts could have
referred— “Sir Humphry Davy told me that he did not consider
this undiscovered art as impossible; but should it ever be dis
".overed, it would certainly be useless.”

vain, at some moments rousing himself from credulity to
the skepticism he deprecated, to reconcile what he had
heard with the probable motives and designs of an im-
postor. Unlike Mesmer and Cagliostro, Zanoni, what-
ever his pretensions, did not make them a source of proﬁt;
nor was Glyndon’s position or rank in life suﬂicient to
render any inﬂuence obtained over his mind, subservient
to schemes, whether of avarice or ambition. Yet, ever
and anon, with the suspicion of worldly knowledge, he
strove to persuade himself that Zanoni had at least some
sinister object in inducing him to what his English pride
and manner of thought considered a derogatory marriage
with the poor actress. Might not Viola and the Mystic
be in league with each other? Might not all this jargon ‘
of prophecy and menace be but artiﬁces t0 dupe him?
He felt an unjust resentment towards Viola, at her hav-
ing secured such an ally. But with that resentment was
mingled a natural jealousy. Zanoni threatened him with
rivalry. Zanoni, who, whatever his character or his arts,
possessed at least all the external attributes that dazzle
and command. Impatient of his own doubts, he plunged
into the society of such acquaintances as he had made at
Naples—chieﬂy artists, like himself, men of letters, and
the rich commercialists, who were already vying with the
splendor, though debarred from the privileges, of the
nobles. From these he heard much of Zanoni, already
with them, as with the idler classes, an object of curiosity
and speculation.
He had noticed, as a thing remarkable, that Zanoni

140 ZANONI.
had conversed with him in English, and with a command
of the language so complete, that he might have passed
for a native. On the other hand, in Italian, Zanoni was
equally at ease. Glyndon found that it was the same in
languages less usually learned by foreigners. A painter
from Sweden, who had conversed with him, was positive
that he was a Swede; and a merchant from Constanti-
nople, who had sold some of his goods to Zanoni, pro—
fessed his conviction that none but a Turk, or at least a
native of the East, could have so thoroughly mastered
the soft Oriental intonations. Yet, in all these languages,
when they came to compare their several recollections,
there was a slight, scarce perceptible distinction, not in
pronunciation, nor even accent, but in the key and chime,
as it were, of the voice, between himself and a native.
This faculty was one which Glyndon called to mind, that
sect, whose tenets and powers have never been more than
most partially explored, the Rosicrusians, especially arro-
gated. He remembered to have heard in Germany of the
work of John Bringeret,* asserting that all the languages
of the earth were known to the genuine Brotherhood of
the Rosy Cross. Did Zanoni belong to this mystical
Fraternity, who, in an earlier age, boasted of secrets of
which the Philosopher’s Stone was but the least; who
considered themselves the heirs of all that the Chaldaeans,
the Magi, the Gymnosophists, and the Platonists had
taught; and who differed from all the darker Sons of
Magic in the virtue of their lives, the purity of their doc~

trines, and their insisting, as the foundation of all wisdom,
on the subjugation of the senses, and the intensity of Re-
ligious Faith ?-a glorious sect, if they lied not ! And,
in truth, if Zanoni had powers beyond the race of worldly
sages, they seemed not unworthily exercised. The little
known of his life was in his favor. Some acts, not of
indiscriminate, but judicious generosity and beneﬁcence,
were recorded; in repeating which, still, however, the
narrators shook their heads, and expressed surprise how
a stranger should have possessed so minute a knowledge
of the quiet and obscure distresses he had relieved. Two
or three sick persons, when abandoned by their physicians,
he had visited and conferred with alone. They had re-
covered; they ascribed to him their recovery; yet they
could not tell by what medicines they had been healed.
They could only depose that he came, conversed with
them, and they were cured; it usually, however, happened,
that a deep sleep had preceded the recovery.
Another circumstance was also beginning to be re-
marked, and spoke yet more in his commendation. Those
with whom he principally associated—the gay, the dissi-
pated, the thoughtless, the sinners and publicans of the
more polished world—all appeared rapidly, yet insensibly
to themselves, to awaken to purer thoughts and more
regulated lives. Even Cetoxa, the prince of gallants,
duellists, and gamesters, was no longer the same man
since the night of the singular events which he .had re-
lated to Glyndon. The ﬁrst trace of his reform was in
his retirement from the gaming-houses; the next was his

reconciliation with an hereditary enemy of his house,
whom it had been his constant object for the last six
years to entangle in such a quarrel as might call forth
his inimitable manoeuvre of the stoccata. Nor when
Oetoxa and his young companions were heard to =peak
of Zanoni, did it seem that this change had been brought
about by any sober lectures or admonitions. They all
described Zanoni as a man keenly alive to enjoyment -_
of manners, the reverse of formal-not precisely gay, but
equable, serene, and cheerful; ever ready to listen to the
talk of others, however idle, or to charm all ears with an
inexhaustible fund of brilliant anecdote and worldly ex-
perience. All manners, all nations, all grades of men
seemed familiar to him. He was reserved only if allusion
were ever ventured to his birth or history. The more
general opinion of his origin certainly seemed the more
plausible. His riches, his familiarity with the languages
of the East, his residence in India, a certain gravity
which never deserted his most cheerful and familiar hours,
the lustrous darkness of his eyes and hair, and even the
peculiarities of his shape, in the delicate smallness of the
hands, and the Arab-like turn of the stately head, ap-
peared to ﬁx him as belonging to one at least of the
Oriental races. And a dabbler in the Eastern tongues
even sought to reduce the simple name of Zanoni, which
a century before had been borne by an inoffensive natura-
list of Bologna,* to the radicals of the extinct language.
Zan was unquestionably the Chaldaean appellation for the

sun. Even the Greeks, who mutilated every Oriental name,
had retained the right one in this case, as the Cretan in-
scription 0n the tomb of Zeus* signiﬁcantly showed. As
to the rest, the Zan, or Zaun, was, with the Sidonians, no
uncommon preﬁx to On. Adonis was but another name
for Zanonas, whose worship in Sidon Hesychius records.
To this profound and unanswerable derivation, Mervale
listened with great attention, and observed that he now
ventured to announce an erudite discovery he himself had
long since made—via, that the numerous family of Smiths
in England were undoubtedly the ancient priests of the
Phrygian Apollo. “For,” said he, “was not Apollo’s
surname, in Phrygia, Smintheus ? How clear all the
ensuing corruptions of the august name — Smintheus——
Smitheus— Smithé— Smith 1 And even now, I may re-
mark that the more ancient branches of that illustrious
family, unconsciously anxious to approximate at least by
a letter nearer to the true title, take a pious pleasure in
writing their names Smiths l”
The Philologist was much struck with this discovery,
and begged Mervale’s permission to note it down as an
illustration suitable to a work he was about to publish on
the origin of languages, to be called “Babel,” and pub-
lished in three quartos by subscription.

CHAPTER VII.
Learn to be poor in spirit, my son, if you would penetrate that
sacred night which environs truth. Learn of the Sages to allow
to the Devils no power in nature, since the fatal stone has shut
’em up in the depth of the abyss. Learn of the Philosophers al-

ALL these additions to his knowledge of Zanoni, picked
up in the various lounging-places and resorts that he fre-
quented, were unsatisfactory to Glyndon. That night
Viola did not perform at the theatre ; and the next day,
still disturbed by bewildered fancies, and averse to the
sober and sarcastic companionship of Mervale, Glyndon
sauntered musingly into the public gardens, and paused
beneath the very tree under which he had ﬁrst heard the
voice that had exercised upon his mind so singular an
inﬂuence. The gardens were deserted. He threw him-
self on one of the seats placed beneath the shade; and
again, in the midst of his reverie, the same cold shudder
came over him which Zanoni had so distinctly deﬁned,
and to which he had ascribed s0 extraordinary a cause.
He roused himself with a sudden effort, and started to
see, seated next him, a ﬁgure hideous enough to have
personated one of the malignant beings of whom Zanoni
had spoken. It was a small man, dressed in a fashion

strikingly at variance with the elaborate costume of the
day: an aﬁectation of homeliness and poverty approach-
ing to squalor, in the loose trowsers, coarse as a ship’s
sail—in the rough jacket, which appeared rent wilfully
into holes—and the black, ragged, tangled locks that
streamed from their conﬁnement under a woollen cap, ac-
corded but ill with other details which spoke of compara- _
tive wealth. The shirt, open at the throat, was fastened
by a brooch of gaudy stones; and two pendent massive
gold chains announced the foppery of two watches.
The man’s ﬁgure, if not absolutely deformed, was yet
marvellously ill-favored; his shoulders high and square;
his chest ﬂattened, as if crushed in; his gloveless hands
were knotted at the joints, and large, bony and muscular,
dangled from lean, emaciated wrists, as if not belonging
to them. His features had the painful distortion some-
times seen in the countenance of a cripple—large, exag-
gerated, with the nose nearly touching the chin : the eyes
small, but glowing with a cunning ﬁre as they dwelt on
Glyndon; and the mouth was twisted into a grin that
displayed rows ofjagged, black, broken teeth. Yet over
this frightful face there still played a kind of disagreeable
intelligence, an expression at once astute and bold ; and
as Glyndon, recovering from the ﬁrst impression, looked
again at his neighbor, he blushed at his ,own dismay, and
recognized a French artist, with whom he had formed an
acquaintance, and who was possessed of no inconsiderable
talents in his calling. Indeed, it was to be remarked that

Graces, particularly delighted in designs aspiring to ma
jesty and grandeur. Though his coloring was hard and
shallow, as was that generally of the French school at
the time, his drawings were admirable for symmetry,
simple elegance, and classic vigor; at the same time they
unquestionably wanted ideal grace. He was fond of se-
lecting subjects from Roman History, rather than from
‘the copious world of Grecian beauty, or those still more
sublime stories of scriptural record from which Rafaele
and Michael Angelo borrowed their inspirations. His
grandeur was that, not of gods and saints, but mortals.
His delineation of beauty was that which the eye cannot
blame and the soul does not acknowledge. In a word,
as it was said of Dionysius, he was an Anthropographos,
or Painter of Men. It was also a notable contradiction
in this person, who was addicted to the m0st extravagant
excesses in every passion, whether of hate or love, im-
placable in revenge, and insatiable in debauch, that he
was in the habit of uttering the most beautiful sentiments
of exalted purity and genial philanthropy. The world
was not good enough for him; he was, to use the ex-
pressive German phrase, a world-betterer! Neverthe-
less, his sarcastic lip often seemed to mock the sentiments
he uttered, as if it sought to insinuate that he was above
even the world he would construct.
Finally, this painter was in close correspondence with
the Republicans of Paris, and was held to be one of those
missionaries whom, from the earliest period of the Revo~
lution, the regenerators of mankind were pleased to des-

patch to the various states yet shackled, whether by
actual tyranny, or wholesome laws. Certainly as the
historian of Italy* has observed, there was no city in
Italy where these new doctrines would be received with
greater favor than Naples, partly from the lively temper
of the people, principally because the most hateful feudal
privileges, however partially curtailed some years before
by the great minister, Tanuccini, still presented so many
daily and practical evils as to make change wear a more
substantial charm than the mere and meretrieious bloom
on the check of the harlot—Novelty. This man, whom
I will call Jean Nicot, was, therefore, an oracle among
the younger and bolder spirits of Naples; and before
Glyndon had met Zanoni, the former had not been among
the least dazzled by the eloquent aspirations of the hide-
ous Philanthropist.
“ It is so long since we have met, c/zer confrére,” said
iNicot, drawing his seat nearer to Glyndon’s, “that you
cannot be surprised that I see you with delight, and even
take the liberty to intrude on your meditations.”
“They were of no agreeable nature,” said Glyndon;
“ and never was intrusion more welcome.”
“ You will be charmed to hear,” said Nicot, drawing
several letters from his bosom, “that the good work pro-
ceeds with marvellous rapidity. Mirabeau, indeed, is no
more; but, mort Diable! the French people are now a
Mirabeau themselves.” With this remark, Monsieur Nicot

proceeded to read and to comment upon several animated
and interesting passages in his correspondence, in which
the word Virtue was introduced twenty-seven times, and
God not once. And then, warmed by the cheering pros-
pects thus opened to him, he began to indulge in those
anticipations of the future, the outline of which we have
already seen in the eloquent extravagance of Condorcet.
All the Old Virtues were dethroned for a new Pantheon :
Patriotism was a narrow sentiment; Philanthropy was
to be its successor. No love that did not embrace all
mankind, as warm for Indus and the Pole as for the
hearth of home, was worthy the breast of a generous man.
Opinion was to be free as air; and in order to make it
so, it was necessary to exterminate all those whose opin-
ions were not the same as Mons. Jean Nicot’s. Much
of this amused, much revolted Glyndon; but when the
Painter turned to dwell upon a science that all should
comprehend—and the results of which all should enjoy,
-a science that, springing from the soil of equal insti-
tutions and equal mental cultivation, should give to all
the races of men wealth without labor, and a life longer
than the Patriarchs’, without care,-then Glyndon listened
with interest and admiration, not unmixed with awe.
“Observe,” said Nicot, “ how much that we now cherish
as a virtue will then be rejected as meanness. Our op-
pressors, for instance, preach to us of the excellence of
gratitude. Gratitude, the confession of inferiority l What
so hateful to a noble spirit as the humiliating sense of
obligation ? But where there is equality there can be no

means for power thus to enslave merit. The benefactor
and the client will alike cease, and -—-”
“And in the mean time,” said a low voice, at hand,
“in the mean time, Jean Nicot?”
The two artists started, and Glyndon recognized Zanoni.
He gazed with a brow of unusual sternness on Nicot,
who, lumped together as he sat, looked up at him askew,
and with an expression of fear and dismay upon his dis-
torted countenance.
Ho, ho! Messire Jean Nicot, thou who fearest neither
God nor Devil, why fearest thou the eye of a man?
“ It is not the ﬁrst time I have been a witness to your
opinions on the inﬁrmity of gratitude,” said Zanoni.
Nicot suppressed an exclamation, and, after gloomily
surveying Zanoni with an eye villanous and sinister, but
full of hate impotent and unutterable, said, “ I know you
not—what would you of me ?”
“Your absence. Leave us!”
Nicot sprung forward a step, with hands clenched, and
showing his teeth from ear to ear, like a wild beast in-
censed. Zanoni stood motionless, and smiled at him in
scorn. Nicot halted abruptly, as if ﬁxed and fascinated
by the look, shivered from head to foot, and sullenly, and
with a visible effort, as if impelled by a power not his
own, turned away.
‘Glyndon’s eyes followed him in surprise.
“And what know you of this man ?” said Zanoni.
“I know him as one like myself—a follower of art."
“Of ART! Do not so profane that glorious word

What nature is to God, Art should be to Man—a sublime,
beneﬁcent, genial, and warm creation. That wretch may
be a painter, not an artist.”
“And pardon me if I ask what you know of one you
thus disparage ?” ~
“I know thus much, that you are beneath my care if
it be necessary to warn you against him; his own lips
show the hideousness of his heart. Why should I tell
you of the crimes he has committed 1 He speaks crime l ”
“You do not seem, Signor Zanoni, to be one of the
admirers of the dawning Revolution. Perhaps you are
prejudiced against the man because you dislike the opin-
ions ? ’-'
“ What opinions?”
Glyndon paused, somewhat puzzled to deﬁne; but at
length he said, “ Nay, I must wrong you; for you, of all
men, I suppose, cannot discredit the doctrine that preaches
the inﬁnite improvement of the human species.”
“You are right; the few in every age improve the
many; the many now may be as wise as the few were;
but improvement is at a stand-still, if you tell me that, the
many now are as wise as the few are.”
“I comprehend you; you will not allow the law of
universal equality l ”
“ Lawl If the whole world conspired to enforce the
falsehood, they could not make it law. Level all condi-
tions to-day, and you only smooth away all obstacles to

from the radiant and completed planet to the nebula that
hardens through ages of mist and slime into the habitable
world, the ﬁrst law of nature is inequality.”
“Harsh doctrine, if applied to states. Are the cruel
disparities of life never to be removed?”
“ Disparities of the physical life ? Oh, let us hope so.
But disparities of the intellectual and the moral, never 1
Universal equality of intelligence, of mind, of genius, of

shines upon the plain. Diﬂ'use all the knowledge the
earth contains equally over all mankind to-day, and some
men will be wiser than the rest to-morrow. And this is
not a harsh, but a loving law,— the real law of Improve-
ment; the wiser the few in one generation, the wiser will
be the multitude the next!”
As Zanoni thus spoke, they moved on through the
smiling gardens, and the beautiful bay lay sparkling in
the noontide. A gentle breeze just cooled the sunbeam,
and stirred the ocean; and in the inexpressible clearnoss
of the atmosphere, there was som‘ething that rejoiced the
senses. The very soul seemed to grow lighter and purer
in that lucid air.
“And these men, to commence their era of improvement
and equality, are jealous even of the Creator. They

would deny an Intelligence—a God l” said Zanoni, as
if involuntarily. “Are you an Artist, and, looking on the
world, can you listen to such a dogma? Between God
and Genius there is a necessary link—there is almost a
correspondent language. Well said the Pythagorean.*
——‘A good intellect is the chorus of divinity.’ ”
Struck and touched with these sentiments, which he
little expected to fall from one to whom he ascribed those
powers which the superstitions of childhood ascribe to
the darker agencies, Glyndon said: “And yet you have
confessed that your life, separated from that of others, is
one that man should dread to share. Is there, then, a
connection between magic and religion ?”
“ Magic! And what is magic? When the traveller
beholds in Persia the ruins of palaces and temples, the
ignorant inhabitants inform him they were the work of
magicians! What is beyond their own power, the vulgar

But if by magic you mean a perpetual research amongst
all that is latent or obscure in nature, I answer, I profess
that magic, and that he who does so comes but nearer to
the fountain of all belief. Knowest thou not that magic
was taught in the schools of old? But how, and by
whom ? as the last and most solemn lesson, by the Priests
who ministered to the Temple? And you, who would
be a painter, is not there a magic also in that art you
would advance ? Must you not, after long study of the

Beautiful that has been, seize upon new and airy combi-
nations of a beauty that is to be? See you not that The
Grander Art, whether of poet or of painter, ever seeking
for the TRUE, abhors the REAL; that you must seize Nature
as her master, not lackey her as her lave? You demand
mastery over the past, a conception of the future. Has
not the Art that is truly noble, for its domain the Future
and the Past? You would conjure the invisible beings
to your charm ; and what is painting but the ﬁxing into
substance the Invisible? Are you discontented with this
world? This world was never meant for genius! To
exist, it must create another. What magician can do
more; nay, what science can do as much .7 There are two
avenues from the little passions and the drear calamities
of earth; both lead to heaven, and away from hell—Art
and Science. But art is more god-like than science ;
science discovers, art creates. You have faculties that
may command art; be contented with your lot. The
astronomer who catalogues the stars cannot add one atom
to the universe; the poet can call an universe from the
atom ; the chemist may heal with his drugs the inﬁrmities
of the human form; the painter, or the sculptor, ﬁxes
into everlasting youth forms divine, which no disease can
ravage, and no years impair. Renounce those wandering
fancies that lead you now to myself, and now to yon orator
of the human race; to us two, who are the antipodes of
each other! Your pencil is your wand; your canvas

ever asked more to cheer his path to the grave, than love
and glory ? ”
“ But,” said Glyndon, ﬁxing his eyes earnestly (in
Zanoni, “ if there be a power to baﬂie the grave itself "

Zanoni’s brow darkened. “And were this so,” he said,
after a pause, “ would it be so sweet a lot to outlive all
you loved, and to recoil from every human tie Y Perhaps
the fairest immortality on earth is that of a noble name.”
“You do not answer me—you equivocate. I have
read of the long lives far beyond the date common expe-
rience assigns to man,” persisted Glyndon, “which some
of the alchymists enjoyed. Is the golden elixir but a
fable ?”
“ If not, and these men discovered it, they died, because
they refused to live I There may be a mournful Warning
in your conjecture. Turn once more to the easel and the

So saying, Zanoni waved his hand, and, with downcast
eyes and a slow step, bent his way back into the city.

CHAPTER VIII.
Tun Gonnnss WISDOM.
To some she is the goddess great;
To some the milch cow of the ﬁeld;
Their care is but to calculate
What butter she will yield.
From Sourntun.
THIs last conversation with Zanoni left upon the mind
of Glyndon a tranquillizing and salutary eﬁ'ect. From
the confused mists of his fancy glittered forth again those
happy, golden schemes which part from the young ambi-
tion of art, to play in the air, to illumine the space, like
rays that kindle from the sun. And with these projects
mingled also the vision of a love purer and serener than
his life yet had known. His mind went back into that
fair childhood of genius, when the forbidden fruit is not
yet tasted, and we know of no land beyond the Eden
which is gladdened by an Eve. Inseusibly before him rose
the scenes of a home, with his art snﬂicing for all excite-
ment, and Viola’s love circling occupation with happiness
and content; and in the midst of these phantasies ofa
future that might be at his command, he was recalled to
the present by the clear strong voice of Mervale, the man
of common sense.
Whoever has studied the lives of persons in whom the

imagination is stronger than the will, who suspect their
own knowledge of actual life, and are aware of their facil~
ity to impressions,— will have observed the inﬂuence
which a- homely, vigorous, worldly understanding obtains
over such natures. It was thus with Glyndon. His friend
had often extricated him from danger, and saved him
from the consequences of imprudence: and there was
something in Mervale’s voice alone that damped his enthu-
siasm, and often made him yet more ashamed of noble
impulses than weak conduct. For Mervale, though a
downright honest man, could not sympathize with the
extravagance of generosity any more than with that of
presumption and credulity. He walked the straight line
of life, and felt an equal contempt for the man who wan-
dered up the hill-sides, no matter whether to chase a
butterﬂy, or to catch a prospect of the ocean.
“I will tell you your thoughts, Clarence,” said Mervale,
laughing, “though I am no Zanoni. I know them by the
moisture of your eyes, and the half-smile on your lips.
You are musing upon that fair perdition—the little singer
of San Carlo.”
The little singer of San Carlo! Glyndon colored as
he answered,—
“ Would you speak thus of her if she were my wife ?”
“ No ! for then any contempt I might venture to feel
would be for yourself. One may dislike the duper, but
it is the dupe that one despises.”
“Are you sure that I should be the dupe in such an
union ? Where can I ﬁnd one so lovely and so innocent

—whcre one whose virtue has been tried by such tempta~
tion? Does even a single breath of slander sully the
name of Viola Pisani?”
“I know not all the gossip of Naples, and therefore
cannot answer; but I know this, that in England no one
would believe that a young Englishman, of good fortune,
and respectable birth, who marries a singer from the
theatre of Naples, has not been lamentably taken in. I
would save you from a fall of position so irretrievable.
Think how many mortiﬁcations you will be subjectedto;
how many young men will visit at your house; and how
many young wives will as carefully avoid it.”
“ I can choose my own career, to which commonplace
society is not essential. I can owe the respect of the
world to my art, and not to the accidents of birth and
fortune.”
“That is, you still persist in your second folly—the
absurd ambition of daubing canvas. Heaven forbid I
should say anything against the laudable industry of one
who follows such a profession for the sake of subsistence ;
but with means and connections that will raise you in
life, why voluntarily sink into a mere artist? As an
accomplishment in leisure moments, it is all very well in
its way; but as the occupation ofexistence, it is a frenzy.”
“Artists have been the friends of princes.”
“Very rarely so, I fancy, in sober England. There,
in the great centre of political aristocracy, what men
respect is the practical, not the ideal. Just suﬂ‘er me to

to England; he marries a lady of fortune equal to his
own, of friends and parentage that advance rational ambi-
tion. Clarence Glyndon, thus a wealthy and respectable
man, of good talents, of bustling energies then concen-
trated, enters into practical life. He has a house at which
he can receive those whose acquaintance is both advan-
tage and honor; he has leisure which he can devote to
useful studies; his reputation, built on a solid base, grows
in men’s months He attaches himself to a party; he
enters political life ; his new connections serve to promote
his objects. At the age of ﬁve-and-forty, what, in all
probability, may Clarence Glyudon be? Since you are
ambitious, I leave that question for you to decide l Now
turn to the other picture. Clarence Glyndon returns to
England with a wife who can bring him no money, unless
he lets her out on the stage; so handsome, that every
one asks who she is, and every one hears—the celebrated
singer, Pisani. Clarence Glyndon shuts himself up to
grind colors and paint pictures in the grand historical
school, which nobody buys. There is even a prejudice
against him, as not having studied in the Academy-—as
being an amateur. Who is Mr.’ Clarence Glyndon ? Oh l
the celebrated Pisani’s husband! What else? Oh I he
exhibits those large pictures. Poor man 1 they have
merit in their way; but Teniers and Watteau are more
convenient, and almost as cheap. Clarence Glyndon, with
an easy fortune while single, has a large family, which his
fortune, unaided by marriage, can just rear up to callings
more plebeian than his own. He retires into the country,

to save and to paint ; he grows slovenly and discontented;
‘the world does not appreciate him,’ he says, and he runs
away from the world. At the age of forty-ﬁve, what will
be Clarence Glyndon ? Your ambition shall decide that
question also 1 ”
“If all men were as worldly as you,” said Glyndon,
rising, “there would never have been an artist or a poet 1 ”
“Perhaps we should do just as well without them,”
answered Mervale. “ Is it not time to think of dinner?
The mullets here are remarkably ﬁne 1”

whether its plastic expression be found in words or mar-
ble, colors or sounds, the servile imitation of nature is the
work of journeymen and tyros ; -— so in conduct the man
of the world vitiates and lowers the bold enthusiasm of
loftier natures by the perpetual reduction of _whatever in
generous and trustful to all that is trite and coarse. A.
great German poet has well deﬁned the distinction be-
tween discretion and the larger wisdom. In the last there
is a certain rashuess which the ﬁrst disdains—
“ The purblind see but the receding shore,
Not that to which the bold wave wafts them o’er."
Yet in this logic of the prudent and the worldly there
is often a reasoning unanswerable of its kind.
You must have a feeling—a faith in whatever is self-
sacriﬁcing and divine—whether in religion or in art, in
glory or in love—or Common-sense will reason you out
of the sacriﬁce, and a syllogism will debase The Divine
to an article in the market.
Every true critic in art, from Aristotle and Pliny—from
Winkelman and Vasari, to Reynolds and Fuseli, has
sought to instruct the painter that Nature is not to be
copied, but exalted ,' that the loftiest order of art, selecting
only the loftiest combinations, is the perpetual struggle
of Humanity to approach the Gods. The great painter,
as the great author, embodies what is possible to man, it
is true, but what is not common to mankind. There is
truth in Hamlet; in Macbeth, and his witches; in Des-
demona; in _Othello; in Prospero, and in Caliban; there
is truth in the Cartoons of Rafaele ; there is truth in the

Apollo, the Antinoiis, and the Laocoon. But you do not
meet the originals of the words, the cartoons, or the
\marble, in Oxford Street or St. James. All these, to
return to Rafaele, are the creatures of the idea in the
artist’s mind. This idea is not inborn; it has come from
an intense study. But that study has been of the ideal,
that can be raised from the positive and the actual into
grandeur and beauty. The commonest model becomes
full of exquisite suggestions to him who has formed this
idea; a Venus of ﬂesh and blood would be vulgarized by
the imitation of him who has not.
When asked where he got his models, Guido summoned
a common porter from his calling, and drew from a mean
original a head of surpassing beauty. It resembled the
porter, but idealized the porter to the hero. It was true,
but it was not real. There are critics who will tell you
that the Boor of Teniers is more true to nature than the
Porter of Guido l The commonplace public scarcely
understand the idealizing principle, even in art; for high
art is an acquired taste.
But to come to my comparison. Still less is the kin-
dred principle comprehended in conduct. And the advice
of worldly Prudence would as often deter from the risks
of Virtue as from the punishments of Vice; yet in con-
duct, as in art, there is an idea of the great and beautiful,
by which men should exalt the hackneyed and the trite
of life. Now, Glyndon felt the sober prudence of Mer-
vale’s'reasonings; he recoiled from the probable picture
placed before him, in his devotion to the one master-talent

he possessed, and the one master-passion that, rightly
directed, might purify his whole being as a strong wind
puriﬁes the air.
But though he could not bring himself to decide in
the teeth of so rational a judgment, neither could he re-
solve at once to abandon the pursuit of Viola. Fearful
of being inﬂuenced by Zanoni’s counsels and his own
heart, he had for the last two days shunned an interview '
with the young actress. But after a night following his
last conversation with Zanoni, and that we have just re-
corded with Mervale—a night colored by dreams so dis-
tinct as to seem prophetic—dreams that appeared so to
shape his future according to the hints of Zanoni, that he
could have fancied Zanoni himself had sent them from the
house of sleep to haunt his pillow, be resolved once more
to seek Viola; and though without a deﬁnite or distinct
object, he yielded himself up to the impulse of his heart.

traveller of to-day is duly brought to gaze on the tomb
of Virgil, or compare with the cavern of Posilipo the
archway of Highgate Hill. There were a few ﬁshermen
loitering by the cliffs, on which their nets were hung to
dry; and at a distance, the sound of some rustic pipe
(more common at that day than at this) mingled now
and then with the bells 'of the lazy mules, broke the vo-
luptuous silence-the silence of declining noon on the
shores of Naples ;-never, till you have enjoyed it, never

The eyes of the actress were ﬁxed on the broad blue
deep beyond. In the unwonted negligence of her dress
might be traced the abstraction of her mind. Her beau-
tiful hair was gathered up loosely, and partially bandaged
by a kerchief, whose purple color served to deepen the
golden hue of her tresses. A stray curl escaped, and fell
down the graceful neck. A loose morning robe, girded
by a sash, left the breeze, that came ever and anon from
the sea, to die upon the bust half disclosed; and the tiny
slipper, that Cinderella might have worn, seemed a world
too wide for the tiny foot which it scarcely covered. It

might be the heat of the day that deepened the soft bloom
of the cheeks, and gave an unwonted languor to the large
dark eyes. In all the pomp of her stage attire—in all
the ﬂush of excitement before the intoxicating lamps—
never had Viola looked so lovely.
By the side of the actress, and ﬁlling up the threshold,
stood Gionetta, with her arms thrust to the elbow in two
huge pockets on either side of her gown.
“But I assure you,” said the nurse, in that sharp, quick,
ear-splitting tone in which the old women of the south
are more than a match for those of the north, “ but I as-
sure you, my darling, that there is not a ﬁner cavalier in
all Naples, nor a more beautiful, than this Inglese; and
I am told that all these Inglesi are much richer than they
seem. Though they have no trees in their country, poor
people i and instead of twenty-four they have only twelve
hours to the day, yet I hear that they shoe their horses

whenever they are troubled with the colic. But you don’t
hear me, little pupil of my eyes, you don’t hear me i”
“And these things are whispered of Zanoni i” said
Viola, half to herself, and unheeding Gionetta’s eulogies
on Glyndon and the English.
“Blessed Maria! do not talk of this terrible Zanoni.
You may be sure that his beautiful face, like his yet more
beautiful pistoles, is only witchcraft. I look at the money

he gave me the other night, every quarter of an hour, to
see whether it has not turned into pebbles.”
“Do you then really believe,” said Viola, with timid
earnestness, “that sorcery still exists?”
“Believe !-Do I' believe in the blessed San Gennaro?
How do you think he cured old Filippo the ﬁsherman,
when the doctor gave him up? How do you think he
has managed himself to live at least these three hundred
years? How do you think he fascinates every one to his
bidding with a look, as the vampires do?”
“Ah, is this only witchcraft? It is like it—it must
be i” murmured Viola, turning very pale. Gionetta her-
self was scarcely more superstitious than the daughter of
the musician. And her very innocence, chilled at the
strangeness of virgin passion, might well ascribe to magic
what hearts more experienced would have resolved to love.
“ And then, why has this great Prince di— been so
terriﬁed by him ? Why has he ceased to persecute us?
Why has he been so quiet and still? Is there no sorcery
in all that?”
“Think you, then,” said Viola, with sweet inconsis-
tency, “that I owe that happiness and safety to his pro-
tection? Oh, let me so believe! Be silent, Gionettal

with wild energy; “thou lightest every spot but this.

darling, and then nobody will care for you. Nobody
cares for us when we grow ugly; I know that; and then
you must, like old Gionetta, get some Viola of your own
to spoil. I’ll go and see to the polenta.”
“Since I have known this man," said the girl, half
aloud, “since his dark eyes have haunted me, I am no
longer the same. I long to escape from myself—t0 glide
with the sunbeam over the hill-tops—to become some-
thing that is not of earth. Phantoms ﬂit before me at
night; and a ﬂuttering, like the wing of a bird, within
my heart, seems as if the spirit were terriﬁed, and would
break its cage.”
While murmuring these incoherent rhapsodies, a step
that she did not hear approached the actress, and a light
hand touched her arm.
“ Viola l -— bellissima ! —— Viola ! "
She turned, and saw Glyndon. The sight of his fair
young face calmed her at once. His presence gave her
pleasure.
“Viola,” said the Englishman, taking her hand, and
drawing her again to the bench from which she had risen,
as he seated himself beside her, “ you shall hear me
speakl You must know already that I love thee! It
has not been pity or admiration alone that has led me
ever and ever to thy dear side; reasons there may have
been why I have not spoken, save by my eyes, before;

tained and settled courage to address thee, and learn the

happiest or the worst. I have rivals, I know—rivals who
are more powerful than the poor artist; are they also
more favored ? " ‘
Viola blushed faintly; but her countenance was grave
and distressed. Looking down, and marking some hiero-
glyphical ﬁgures in the dust with the point of her slipper,
she said, with some hesitation, and a vain attempt to be
gay, “Signor, whoever wastes his thoughts on an actress
must submit to have rivals. It is our unhappy destiny
not to be sacred even to ourselves.”
“ But you do not love this destiny, glittering though it
seem; your heart is not in the vocation which your gifts
adorn.” ,
“Ah, no i” said the actress, her eyes ﬁlling with tears.
“ Once I loved to be the priestess of song and music ; now
I feel only that it is a miserable lot to be slave to a mul-
titude.”
“Fly, then, with me,” said the artist, passionately;
“ quit for ever the calling that divides that heart would

“Thou art gOod and fair,” said Viola, gazing on her
lover, as he pressed nearer to her, and clasped her hand
in his: “But what should I give thee in return?”

“Of innocence l ” said Viola. “Is it so? Perhaps ”

art generous. It is not the innoeence thou wouldst de-

Glyndon drew back, conscience-stricken.
“ L‘Io, it may not be I” she said, rising, but not con-
scious of the thoughts, half of shame, half suspicion, that
passed through the mind of her lover. “ Leave me, and
forget me. You do not understand, you could not com-
prehend, the nature of her whom you think to love. From
my childhood upward, I have felt as if I were marked out
for some strange and preternatural doom; as if I were
singled from my kind. This feeling (and, oh I at times it
is one of delirious and vague delight, at others of the
darkest gloom) deepens within me day by day. It is like

the shadow of twilight, spreading slowly and solemnly
around. My hour approaches: a little while, and it will
be night!” _
As she spoke, Glyndon listened with visible emotion
and perturbation. “Viola l ” he exclaimed, as she ceased,
“your words more than ever enchain me to you. As you
feel, I feel. I, too, have been ever haunted with a chill
and unearthly foreboding. Amidst the crowds of men I
have felt alone. In all my pleasures, my toils, my pur-
suits, a warning voice has murmured in my ear, ‘Time
has a dark mystery in store for thy manhood.’ When you
spoke, it was as the voice of my own soul!”
Viola gazed upon him in mingled wonder and fear.
Her countenance was as white as marble: and those fea—
tures, so divine in their rare symmetry, might have served
the Greek with a study for the Pythouess, when, from the
mystic cavern and the bubbling spring, she ﬁrst hears the
voice of the inspiring god. Gradually the rigor and ten-
sion of that wonderful face relaxed, the color returned,
the pulse beat: the heart animated the frame.
“ Tell me,” she said, turning partially aside, “tell me,
have you seen -- do you know _ a stranger in this city ?
one of whom wild stories are aﬂoat?”
“ You speak of Zanoni? I have seen him ——I know
him-and you? Ah 1 he, too, would be my rival l -—he,
too, would bear thee from me i”
“ You err,” said Viola, hastily, and with a deep sigh;
“he pleads for you; he informed me of your love; he
'oesought me not—not to reject it.”

“ Strange being! incomprehensible enigma! Why did
you name him ?”
“Why, ah! I would have asked whether, when you
ﬁrst saw him, the foreboding, the instinct, of which you
spoke, came on you more fearfully, more intelligibly than
before—whether you felt at once repelled from him, yet
attracted towards him— whether you felt —- “ and the ac-
tress spoke with hurried animation—“that with HIM was
connected the secret of your life?”
“All this I felt,” answered Glyndon, in a trembling
voice, “the ﬁrst time I was in his presence Though all
around me was gay—music, amidst lamp-lit trees, light
converse near, and heaven without a cloud above, -my
knees knocked together, my hair bristled, and my blood
curdled like ice. Since then, he has divided my thoughts
with thee.”
“No more, no more i” said Viola, in a stiﬂed tone:
“there must be the hand of fate in this. I can speak to
you no more now. Farewell l ” She sprung past him
into the house, and closed the door. Glyndon did not
follow her, nor, strange as it may seem, was he so inclined.
The thought and recollection of that moon-lit hour in the
gardens, of the strange address of Zanoni, froze up all
human passion. Viola herself, if not forgotten, shrunk
back like a shadow into the recesses of his breast. He
shivered as he stepped into the sun-light, and musingly
retraeed his steps into the more populous parts of that
liveliest of Italian cities.

AT this time it chanced that Viola had the opportunity
to return the kindness shown to her by the friendly mu-
sician, whose house had received and sheltered her when
first left an orphan on the world. Old Bernardi had
brought up three sons to the same profession as himself,
and they had lately left Naples to seek their fortunes in
the wealthier cities of northern Europe, where the musical
market was less'overstocked. There was only left to glad
the household of his aged wife and himself, a lively, prat-

his second son, whose mother had died in giving her birth.
it so happened that, about a month previous to the date
on which our story has now entered, a paralytic aﬂ‘ection
had disabled Bernardi from the duties of his calling. He

had been always a social, harmless, improvideut, generous
fellow—living on his gains from day to day, as if the day
of sickness and old age never was to arrive. Though he
received a small allowance for his past services, it ill-
suﬂiced for his wants; neither was he free from debt.
Poverty stood at his hearth—when Vioia’s grateful smile
and liberal hand came to chase the grim ﬁend away. But
it is not enough to a heart truly kind to send and give;
more charitable is it to visit and console. “ Forget not
thy father’s friend.” So almost daily went the bright idol
of Naples to the house of Bernardi. Suddenly a heavier
afﬂiction than either poverty or the palsy befell the old
musician. His grand-child, his little Beatrice, fell ill,
suddenly and dangerously ill, of one of those rapid fevers
common to the south; and Viola was summoned from her
strange and fearful reveries of love or fancy, to the sick-
bed of the young suﬁ'erer. _
The child was exceedingly fond of Viola, and the old
people thought that her mere presence would bring heal-
ing; but when Viola arrived, Beatrice was insensible.
Fortunately, there was no performance that evening at
San Carlo, and she resolved to stay the night, and par-
take its fearful cares and dangerous vigil.
But during the night, the child grew worse, the physi-
cian (the leechcraft has never been very skilful at Naples)
shook his powdered head, kept his aromatics at his nos-
trils, administered his palliatives, and departed. Old
Bernardi seated himself by the bed-side in stern silence:
here was the last tie that bound him to life. Well, let

the anchor break, and the battered ship go down! It
was an iron resolve, more fearful than sorrow. An old
man, with one foot in the grave, watching by the couch
of a dying child, is one of the most awful spectacles in '
human calamities. The wife was more active, more bus-
_tling, more hopeful, and more tearful. Viola took heed
of all three. But towards dawn, Beatrice’s state became
so obviously alarming, that Viola herself began to despair.
At this time she saw the old woman' suddenly rise from
before the image of the saint at which she had been
kneeling, wrap herself in her cloak and hood, and quietly
quit the chamber. Viola stole after her.
“ It is cold for thee, good mother, to brave the air; let
me go for the physician?”
“ Child, I am not going to him. I have heard of one
in the city who has been tender to the poor, and who,
they say, has cured the sick when physicians failed. I
will go and say to him, ‘ Signor, we are beggars in all
else, but yesterday we were rich in love. We are at the
close of life, but we lived in our grandchild’s childhood.
Give us back our wealth— give us back our youth. Let
us die blessing God that the thing we love survives us. "
She was gone. Why did thy heart beat, Viola? The
infant’s sharp cry of pain called her back to the couch ;
and there still sat the old man, unconscious of his wife’s
movements, not stirring, his eyes glazing fast as they
watched the agonies of that slight frame. By degrees
the wail of pain died into a low moan —the convulsions
grew feebler but more frequent-the glow of fever faded -

into the blue, pale tinge that settles into the last bloodless
marble.
The daylight came broader and clearer through the
casement—steps were heard on the stairs-the old woman
entered hastily: she rushed to the bed, cast a glance on
the patient _“ She lives yet, Signor—she lives 1 ” .
Viola raised her eyes—the child’s head was pillowed
on her bosom—and she beheld Zanoui. He smiled on her
with a tender and soft approval, and took the infant from
her arms. Yet even then, as she saw him bending silently
.over that pale face, a superstitious fear mingled with her
rising hopes. “Was it by lawful—by holy art that —”
her self-questioning ceased abruptly; for his dark eye
turned to her as if he read her soul: and his aspect accused
her conscience for its suspicion, for it spoke reproach not
unmingled with disdain.
“ Be comforted,” he said, gently turning to the old man;
“ the danger is not beyond the reach of human skill ; ” and,
taking from his bosom a Small crystal vase, he mingled a
few drops with water. No sooner did this medicine moisten
the infant’s lips, than it seemed to produce an astonishing
effect. The color revived rapidly on the lips and cheeks;
in a few moments the suﬁ'erer slept calmly, and with the
regular breathing of painless sleep. And then the old
man rose, rigidly, as a corpse might rise—looked down
--listened, and creeping gently away, stole to the corner
of the room, and wept, and thanked Heaven l
Now, old Bernardi had been, hitherto, but a cold
believer; sorrow had never before led him aloft from

earth. Old as was, he had never before thought as the
old should think of death—that endangered life of the
young had wakened up the careless soul of age. Zanoni
whispered to the wife, and she drew the old man quietly
from the room.
“ Dost thou fearto leave me an hour with thy charge,
Viola? Thinkest thou still that this knowledge is of the
Fiend .7”
“All,” said Viola, humbled and yet rejoiced, “forgive
me, forgive me, Signor. Thou biddest the-young live and
the old pray. My thoughts never shall wrong thee more ! ”
Before the sun rose, Beatrice was out of danger; at
noon, Zanoni escaped from the blessings of the aged pair,
and as he closed the door of the house, he found Viola
awaiting him without.
She stood before him timidly, her hands crossed meekly
on her bosom, her downcast eyes swimming with tears.
“ Do not let me be the only one you leave unhappy l”
“And what cure can the herbs and anodynes effect for
thee? Ifthou canst so readily believe ill ofthose who have
aided and yet would serve thee, thy disease is of the heart;

the sad, I should rather approve than chide thee. Forgive
thee 1 Life, that ever needs forgiveness, has, for its ﬁrst

“ No, do not forgive me yet. I do not deserve a par-
don: for even now, while I feel how ungrateful I was to
believe, suspect, aught injurious and false to my preserver,
'my tears ﬂow from happiness, not remorse. Ohl” she

continued, with a simple fervor, unconscious, in her inno-
cence and her generous emotions, of all the secrets she
betrayed—“ thou knowest not how bitter it was to believe
thee act more good, more pure, more sacred than all the
world. And when I saw thee—the wealthy, the noble,
coming from thy palace to minister to the sufferings of
the hovel—when I heard those blessings of the poor
breathed upon thy parting footsteps, I felt my very self
exalted -— good in thy goodness—noble at least in those
thoughts that did not wrong thee.”
“And thinkest thou, Viola, that in a mere act of science
there is so much virtue? The commonest leech will tend
the sick for his fee. Are prayers and blessings a less
reward than gold 1?” ‘
“And mine, then, are not worthless? thou_wilt accept
of mine ?”
“Ah, Viola ! ” exclaimed Zanoni, with a sudden passion,
that covered her face with blushes, “thou only, methinks,
on all the earth, hast the power to wound or delight- me ! ”
He checked himself, and his face became grave and sad.
“And this,” he added, in an altered tone, “because, if
thou wouldst heed my counsels, methinks I could guide
a guileless heart to a happy fate.”
“Thy counsels! I will obey them all. Mould me to
what thou wilt. In thine absence, I am as a child that
fears every shadow in the dark ; in thy presence, my soul
expands and the whole world seems calm with a celestial
noonday. Do not deny to me that presence. I am father-

from her heart; her step seemed to tread on air; she
would have sung for very delight as she went gaily home.

more than happiness to believe in the worth of the One

for love? Did she herself love? No; or she would never
have been at once so humble and so bold. How merrily
the ocean murmured in her ear; how radiant an aspect
the commonest passer-by seemed to wear! She gained
her home—she looked upon the tree, glancing, with fan-
tastic branches, in the sun. “Yes, brother mine I ” she
said, laughing in her joy, “like thee, I have struggled to

Confessional, the transfusion of thought to writing. Now,
suddenly, her heart felt an impulse ; a new-born instinct,
that bade it commune with itself, bade it disentangle its
web of golden fancies— made her wish to look upon her
inmost self as in a glass. Unsprung from the embrace of
Love and Soul—the Eros and the Psyche-their beautiful
oﬁ‘spring, Genius! She blushed, she sighed, she trembled
as she wrote. And from the fresh World that she had
built for herself, she was awakened to prepare for the
glittering stage. How dull became the music, how dim
the scene, so exquisite and so bright of old. Stage, thou
art the Fairy Land to the vision of the worldly. Fancy,
whose music is not heard by men, whose scenes shift not
by mortal hand, as the Stage to the present world, art
thou to the Future and the Past!

THE next day, at noon, Zanoni visited Viola; and the
next day, and the next, and again the next; _-days, that
to her seemed like a special time set apart from the rest
of life. And yet he never spoke to her in that language
of ﬂattery, and almost of adoration, to which she had been
accustomed. Perhaps his very coldness, so gentle as it
was, assisted to this mysterious charm. He talked to her
much of her past life, and she was scarcely surprised (she

now never thought of terror) to perceive now much of
that past seemed known to him. '
He made her speak to him of her father; he made her
recall some of the airs of Pisani’s wild music. And those
airs seemed to charm and lull him into reverie.
“ As music was to the musician,” said he, “ may soieucei
be to the wise. Your father looked abroad in the world;
all was discord to the ﬁne sympathies that he felt with the
harmonies that daily and nightly ﬂoat to the throne of
Heaven. Life, with its noisy ambition and its mean pas-
sions, is so poor and base! Out of his soul he created
the life and the world for which his soul was titted.
Viola, thou art the daughter of that life, and wilt be the
denizen of that world.”
In his earlier visits he did not speak of Glyndon. The
day soon came on which he renewed the subject. And so
trustful, obedient, and entire was the allegiance that Viola
now owned to his dominion, that, unwelcome as that sub-
ject was, she restrainedher heart, and listened to him in
silence l
At last he said, “Thou hast promised thou wilt obey
my counsels, and if, Viola,'I should ask thee, nay adjure,
to accept this stranger’s hand, and share his fate, should
he offer to thee such a lot— wouldst thou refuse ? ”
And then she pressed back the tears that gushed to her
eyes—and with a strange pleasure in the midst of pain—
the pleasure of one who sacriﬁces heart itself to the one
— who commands that heart, she answered, falteriugly_-“ If
thou canst ordain it-why_--”

“ Speak on.”
“Dispose of me as thou wiltl"
Zanoni stood in silence for some moments; he saw the
struggle which the girl thought she concealed so well; he
made an involuntary movement towards her, and pressed
her hand to his lips; it was the ﬁrst time he had ever
departed even so far from a certain austerity, which per-
haps made her fear him and her own thoughts the less.
“ Viola,” said he, and his voice trembled, “the danger
that I can avert no more, if thou linger still in Naples,
comes hourly near and nearer to thee 1 On the third day
from this, thy fate must be decided. I accept thy promise.
Before the last hour of that day, come what may, I shall
see thee again, here, at thine own house. Till then, fare-
well ! ”

WHEN Glyndon left Viola, as recorded in the conclud-
ing chapter of the second division of this work, he was
absorbed again in those mystical desires and conjectures
which the haunting recollection of Zanoni always served
to create. And as he wandered through the streets, he
was scarcely conscious of his own movements till, in the
mechanism of custom, he found himself in the midst of

one of the noble collections of pictures which form the
boast of those Italian cities whose glory is in the past.
Thither he had been wont, almost daily, to repair, for the
gallery contained some of the ﬁnest specimens of a master
especially the object of his enthusiasm and study. There,
before the works of Salvator, he had often paused in deep
and earnest reverence. The striking characteristic of that
artist is the Vigor of Will; void of the elevated idea of
abstract beauty, which furnishes a model and archetype
to the genius of more illustrious order, the singular energy
of the man hews out of the rock a dignity of his own.
His images have the majesty, not of the god, but the
savage ; utterly free, like the sublimer schools, from the
commonplace of imitation,——apart, with them, from the
conventional littleness of the Real,—he grasps the imagi-
nation, and compels it to follow him, not to the heaven,
but through all that is most wild and fantastic upon earth;
a sorcery, not of the starry magian, but of the gloomy
wizard — a man of romance, whose heart beat strongly,
griping art with a hand of iron, and forcing it to idealize
the scenes of his actual life. Before this powerful Will,
Glyndon drew back more awed and admiring than before
the calmer beauty which rose from the soul of Raﬂ‘aéle,
like Venus from the deep. And now, as awaking from
his reverie, he stood opposite to that wild and magniﬁ-
cent gloom of Nature which frowned on him from the
canvas, the very leaves on those gnome-like, distorted
trees, seemed to rustle sibylline secrets in his ear. Those
rugged and sombre Appenines, the cataract that dashed

between, suited, more than the actual scenes would have
done, the mood and temper of his mind. The stern, un-
couth forms at rest on the crags below, and dwarfed by
the giant size of the Matter that reigned around them,
impressed him with the might of Nature and the little-
ness of Man. As in genius of the more spiritual cast,
the living man, and the soul that lives in him, are studi-
ously made the prominent image; and the mere acces-
sories of scene kept down, and cast back, as if to show
that the exile from paradise is yet the monarch of the
outward world,—so, in the landscapes of Salvator, the
tree, the mountain, the waterfall, become the principal,
and man himself dwindles to the accessory. The Matter
seems to reign supreme, and its true lord to creep beneath
its stupendous shadow. Inert matter giving interest to
the immortal man, not thetimmortal man to the inert
matter. A terrible philosophy in art!
While something of these thoughts passed through the
mind of the painter, he felt his arm touched, and saw
Nicot by his side.
“A great master,” said Nicot, “but I do not love the
school.”
“I do not love, but I am awed by it. We love the
beautiful and serene, but we have a feeling as deep as
love for the terrible and dark.”
“ True,” said Nicot, thoughtfully. “And yet that feel~
ing is only a superstition. The nursery, with its tales of
ghosts and goblins, is the cradle of many of our impres-
sions in the world. But art should not seek to pander

to our ignorance; art should represent only truths. I
confess that Raﬁ‘aéle pleases me less, because I have no
sympathy with his subjects. His saints and virgins are
to me only men and women.”
“And from what source should painting then take its
themes 1?”
“ From history, without doubt,” returned Nicot, prag-
matically, -—“ those great Roman actions which inspire
men with sentiments of liberty and valor, with the virtues
of a republic. I wish the cartoons of Raﬁ'aéle had illus-
trated the story of the Horatii ; but it remains for France
and her Republic to give to posterity the new and the
true school, which could never have arisen in a country
of priestCraft and delusion.”
“And the saints and virgins of Raﬁ‘aéle are to you
only men and women ?” repeated Glyndon, going back
to Nicot’scandid confession in amaze, and scarcely hear-
ing the deductions the Frenchman drew from his pro-
position.
“Assuredly. Ha, ha l” and Nicot laughed hideously,
“ do you ask me to believe in the calendar, or what?”
“But the ideal?”
“ The ideal l ” interrupted Nicot. “ Stuff! The Italian
critics, and your English Reynolds, have turned your head.
They are so fond of their ‘ gusto grande,’ and their ‘ideal
beauty that speaks to the soul l ’-sou1 l—ts there a soul Y

bah l — we are but modiﬁcations of matter, and painting
is modiﬁcation of matter also.”
Glyndon turned his eyes from the picture before him
to Nicot, and from Nicot to the picture. The dogmatist
gave a voice to the thoughts which the sight of the pic-
ture had awakened. He shook his head without reply.
“Tell me,” said Nieot, abruptly, “that impostor-
Zanoni ?—oh i I have now learned his name and quack-
eries, forsooth—what did he say to thee of me?"
“Of thee ? Nothing; but to warn me against thy doc-
trines.”
“Aha l was that all?” said Nicot. “He is a notable
inventor, and since, when we met last, I unmasked his
delusions, I thought he might retaliate by some tale of
slander.”
“Unmasked his delusions l —h0w?”
“A dull and long story: he wished to teach an old
doting friend of mine his secrets of prolonged life and
philosophical alchemy. I advise thee to renounce so dis-
creditable an acquaintance.”
With that, Nicot nodded signiﬁcantly, and, not wishing
to be further questioned, went his way.
Glyndon’s mind at that moment had escaped to his art,
and the comments and presence of Nicot had been no
welcome interruption. He turned from the landscape of
Salvator, and his eye falling on a Nativity by Corregio,
the contrast between the two ranks of genius struck him
as a discovery. That exquisite repose-that perfect sense
of beauty—that strength without effort—that breathing

moral of high art, which speaks to the mind through the
eye, and raises the thoughts, by the aid of tenderness and
love, to the regions of awe and wonder,— ay 1 that was
the true school. He quitted the gallery with reluctant
steps and inspired ideas; he sought his own home. Here,
pleased not to ﬁnd the sober Mervale, he lent his face
on his hands, and endeavored to recall the words of Zanoni
in their last meeting. Yes, he felt Nicot’s talk even on
art was crime; it debased the imagination itself to mechan-
ism. Could he, who saw nothing in the soul but a com-
bination of matter, prate of schools that should excel a
Raifaéle? Yes, art was magic; and as he owned the
truth of the aphorism, he could comprehend that in magic
there may be religion, for religion is an essential art. His
old ambition, freeing itself from the frigid prudence with
which Mervale sought to desecrate all images less substan-
tial than the golden calf of the world, revived, and stirred,
and kindled. The subtle detection of what he conceived
to be an error in the school he had hitherto adopted, made
more manifest to him by the grinning commentary of
Nicot, seemed to open to him a new world of invention.
He seized the happy moment—he placed before him the
colors and the canvas. Lost in his conceptions of a fresh
ideal, his mind was lifted aloft into the airy realms of
beauty; dark thoughts, unhallowed desires, vanished.
Zanoni was right: the material world shrunk from his
gaze: he viewed nature as from a mountain-top afar; and
as the waves of his unquiet heart became calm and still,

again the angel eyes of Viola beamed on them as a holy
star.
Locking himself in his chamber, he refused even the
visits of Mervale. Intoxicated with the pure air of his
fresh existence, he remained for three days, and almost
nights,. absorbed in his employment; but on the fourth
morning came the reaction to which all labor is exposed.
He woke listless and fatigued; and as he cast his eyes
on the canvas, the glory seemed to have gone from it.
Humiliating recollections of the great masters he aspired
to rival forced themselves upon him ; defects before unseen
magniﬁed themselves to deformities in his languid and
discontented eyes. He touched and retouched, but his
hand failed him; he threw down his instruments in despair;
he opened his casement; the day without was bright and
lovely; the street was crowded with that life which is
ever so joyous and afﬂuent in the animated population of
Naples. He saw the lover, as he passed, conversing with
his mistress by those mute gestures which have survived
all changes of languages, the same now as when the
Etruscan painted you vases in the Museo Borbonico.
Light from without beckoned his youth to its mirth and
, pleasures; and the dull. walls within, lately large enough
to comprise heaven and earth, seemed now cabined and
conﬁned as a felon’s prison. He welcomed the step of
Merrale at his threshold, and unbarred the door.
“And is that all you have done ?” said Mervale, glancing
disdainfully at the canvas “Is it for this that you have

shut yourself out from the sunny days and moon-lit nights
of Naples?”
“ While the ﬁt was on me, I basked in a brighter sun, .
and imbibed the voluptuous luxury of a softer moon."
“ You own that the ﬁt is over. Well, that is some sign
of returning sense. After all, it is better to daub canvas
for three days than make a fool of yourself for life. This
little siren ?”
“Be dumb l I hate to hear you name her.”
Mervale drew his chair nearer to Glyndon’s, thrustlhis
hands deep in his breeches-pockets, and was about to
begin a serious strain of expostulation, when a knock was
heard at the door, and Nicot, without waiting for leave,
obtruded his ugly head. -
“ Good-day, mon cher confrére. I wished to speak
to you. Hein! you have been at work, I see. This is
well—very well! A bold outline—great freedom in
that right hand. But, hold! is the composition good?
You have not got the great pyramidal form. Don’t you
think, too, that you have lost the advantage of contrast
in this ﬁgure; since the right leg is put forward, surely
the right arm should be put back? Peste ! but that little
ﬁnger is very ﬁne l”
Mervale detested Nicot. For all speculators, Utopians,
alterers of the world, and wanderers from the high road,
were equally hateful to him; but he could have hugged
the Frenchman at that moment. He saw in Glyndon’s
expressive countenance all the weariness and disgust he
endured. After so wrapt a study, to be prated to about

pyramidal forms, and right arms, and right legs—the
accidence of the art—the whole conception to be over-
_ looked, and the criticism to end in approval of the little
ﬁnger!
“Oh,” said Glyndon peevishly, throwing the cloth over
his design, “ enough of my poor performance. What is
it you have to say to me?”
“ In the ﬁrst place,” said Nicot, huddling himself
together upon a stool -“in the ﬁrst place, this Signor
Zanoni —this second Cagliostro — who disputes my doc-
trinesl (no doubt — a spy of the man Capet) I am not
vindictive ; as Helvetius says, ‘ our errors arise from our
passions.’ I keep mine in order; but it is virtuous to
.hate in the cause of mankind; I would I had the denounc-
ing and the judging of Signor Zanoni at Paris.” And
Nicot’s small eyes shot ﬁre, and he gnashed his teeth.
“Have you any new cause to hate him?”
“ Yes,” said Nicot, ﬁercely. “Yes, I hear he is court-
ing the girl I mean to marry.”
“You! Whom do you speak of?”
“The celebrated Pisanil She is divinely handsome.
She would make my fortune in a republic. And a republic
we shall have before the year is out.”
Mervale rubbed his hands, and chuckled. Glyndon
colored with rage and shame.
“Do you know the Signora Pisani? Have you ever
spoken to her?”
“ Not yet. But when I make up my mind to anything,
it is soon done. I am about to return to Paris. They

write me word that a handsome wife advances the career
of a patriot. The age of prejudice is over. The sublimer
virtues begin to he understood. I shall take back the
handsomest wife in Europe.”
“ Be quiet! What are you about ? ” said Mervale, seiz-
ing Glyndon as he saw him advance towards the French-
man, his eyes sparkling, and his hands clenched.
“Sir i” said Glyndon, between his teeth, “ you know
not of whom you thus speak. Do you aﬂ'éct to suppose
that Viola Pisani would accept you?”
“Not if she could get a better offer,” said Mervale,
looking up to the ceiling.
“A better offer? You‘dou’t understand me,” said
Nicot. “I, Jean Nicot, propose to marry the girl;
marry her! Others may make her more liberal offers,
but no one, I apprehend, would make one so honorable.
I alone have pity on her friendless situation. Besides,
according to the dawning state of things, one will always,
in France, be able to get rid of a wife whenever one
wishes. We shall have new laws of divorce. Do ypu
imagine that an Italian girl—and in no country in the
world are maidens, it seems, more chaste (though wives
may console themselves with virtues more philosophical),
-- would refuse the hand of an artist for the settlements
of a prince? No; I think better of the Pisani than you
do. I shall hasten to introduce myself to her.”
“ I wish you all success, Monsieur Nieot,” said Mervale,
rising, and shaking him heartily by the hand.
Glyndon cast at them both a disdainfu! glance.

“Perhaps, Monsieur Nicot,” said he at length, con-
straining his lips into a bitter smile, “ perhaps you may
have rivals.”
“ So much the better,” replied Monsieur Nicot, carc-
lessly, kicking his heels together, and appearing absorbed
in admiration at the size of his large feet.
“I myself admire Viola Pisani.”
“Every painter must l” -
“I may offer her marriage as well as yourself.”
“That would be folly in you, though wisdom in me.

" You do not dare to say you would make proﬁt from

“The virtuous Cato lent his wife to a friend. I love

looking, and I am ugly. But you are irresolute, and I
decisive. While you are uttering ﬁne phrases, I shall say,
simply, ‘I have a ban état. Will you marry me?’ So
do your worst, cher confrére. Au revoir, behind the
scenes I ”
So saying, Nicot rose, stretched his long arms and
short legs, yawned till he showed all his ragged teeth
from ear to ear, pressed down his cap on his shaggy head
with an air of deﬁance, and casting over his left shoulder
a glance of triumph and malice at the indignant Glyndou,
sauntered out of the room. '
Mervale burst into a violent ﬁt of laughter. “See

how your Viola is estimated by your friend. A ﬁne vic-
tory, to carry her off from the ugliest dog between Lap-
land and the Calmucks.”
Glyndon was yet too indignant to answer, when a new
visitor arrived. It was Zanoni himself. Mervale, on
whom the appearance and aspect of this personage im-
posed a kind of reluctant deference, which he was un-
willing to acknowledge, and still more to betray, nodded
to Glyndon, and saying, simply, “More when I see you
again,” left the painter and his unexpected visitor.
“ I see,” said Zanoni, lifting the cloth from the canvas,
“that you have not slighted the advice I gave you.
Courage, young artist ; this is an escape from the schools;
this is full of the bold self-conﬁdence of real genius. You
had no Nieot—no Mervale at your elbow, when this
image of true beauty was conceivedl”
Charmed back to his art by this unlooked-for praise,
Glyndon replied, modestly, “I thought well of my design
till this morning; and then I was disenchanted of my
happy persuasion.”
“ Say, rather, that, unaccustomed to continuous labor,
you were fatigued with your employment.”
“That is true. Shall I confess it? I began to miss
the world without. It seemed to me as if, while I lavished
my heart and my youth upon visions of beauty, I was
'osing the beautiful realities of actual life. And I envied
the merry ﬁsherman, singing as he passed below my case-
ment, and the lover conversing with his mistress.”
“And,” said Zanoni, with an encouraging smile, “do

you blame yourself for the natural and necessary return
to earth, in which even the most habitual visitor of the
Heavens of Invention seeks his relaxation and repose?
Man’s genius is a bird that cannot be always on the wing;
when the craving for the actual world is felt, it is a hunger
that must be appeased. They who command best the
ideal, enjoy ever most the real. See the true artist, when
abroad in men’s thoroughfares, ever observant, ever diving
into the heart, ever alive to the least as to the greatest
of the complicated truths of existence; descending to
what pedants would call the trivial and the frivolous.
From every mesh in the social web, he can disentangle a
grace. And for him each airy gossamer ﬂoats in the gold
of the sunlight. Know you not that around the animal-
cule that sports in the water there shines a halo, as around
the star* that revolves in bright pastime through the
space? True art ﬁnds beauty everywhere. In the street,
in the market-place, in the hovel, it gathers food for the
hive of its thoughts. In the mire of politics, Dante and
Milton selected pearls for the wreath of song. Who ever
told you that Raﬁ'aéle did not enjoy the life without,
carrying everywhere with him the one inward idea of
beauty which attracted and embedded in its own amber
every straw that the feet of the dull man trampled into
mud? As some lord of the forest wanders abroad for
its prey, and scents and follows it over plain and hill,

*The monas mica, found in the purest pools, is encompassed
with a halo. And this is frequent amongst many other species of
unimalculm.

the quarry to its unwitnessed cave — so Genius searches
through wood and waste, untiringly and eagerly, every
sense awake, every nerve strained to speed and strength,
for the scattered and ﬂying images of matter, that it seizes
at last with its mighty talons, and bears away with it into
solitudes no footstep can invade. Go, seek the world
without; it is for art, the inexhaustible pasture-ground
and harvest to the world within!”
“You comfort me,” said Glyndou, brightening. “I
had imagined my weariness a proof of my deﬁciency!
But not now would I speak to you of these labors.
Pardon me if I pass from the toil to the reward. You
have uttered dim prophecies of my future, if I wed one

darken its prospects and obstruct its ambition. Do you

aspires to prediction?”
“Are they not allied? Is it not be best accustomed

in the arithmetic of chances?”
“You evade my question.”
“ No; but I will adapt my answer the better to your
comprehension, for it is upon this very point that I have
sought you. Listen to me!” Zanoni ﬁxed his eyes
earnestly on his listener, and continued. “For the ac-

chances of battle to combinations almost of matnematics.
He can predict a result, if he can but depend upon the
materials he is forced to employ. At such a loss he can
cross that bridge; in such a time he can reduce that fort.
Still more accurately, for he depends less on material
causes than ideas at his command, can the commander of
the purer science or diviner art, if he once perceive the
truths that are in him and around, foretell what he can
achieve, and in what he is condemned to fail. But this
perception of truths is disturbed by many causes—vanity,
passion, fear, indolence in himself, ignorance of the ﬁtting
means without to accomplish what he designs. He may
miscalculate his own forces; he may have no chart of the
country he would invade. It is only in a peculiar state
of the mind that it is capable of perceiving truth; and
that state is profound serenity. Your mind is fevered
by a desire for truth : you would compel it to your cm-
braces; you would ask me to impart to you, without
ordeal or preparation, the grandest secrets that exist in
nature. But truth can no more be seen by the mind un-
prepared for it, than the sun can dawn upon the midst of
night. Such a mind receives truth only to pollute it: to
use the simile of one who has wandered near to the secret
of the sublime Goetia (or the magic that lies within nature,
as electricity within the cloud), ‘ He who pours water into
the muddy well, does but disturb the mud.”’*

ers, who, greater than the magian, leave behind them an
enduring inﬂuence, worshipped wherever beauty is com-
prehended, wherever the soul is sensible of a higher world
than that in which matter struggles for crude and incom-
plete existence.
“But to make available those faculties, need I be a
prophet to tell you that you must learn to concentre upon
great objects all your desires? The heart must rest, that
the mind may be active. At present you wander from
aim to aim. As the ballast to the ship, so to the spirit
are Faith and Love. With your whole heart, affections,
humanity, centered in one object, your mind and aspira-
‘ tions will become equally steadfast and in earnest. Viola
is a child as yet: you do not perceive the high nature the
trials of life will develop. Pardon me, if I say that her
soul, purer and loftier than your own, will bear it upward,
as a sacred hymn carries aloft the spirits of the world.
Your nature wants the harmony, the music which, as the
Pythagoreans wisely taught, at once elevates and soothes.

you that I would disenchant her with truth to make her

“But if,” persisted Glyndon, “if she be all that you
tell me, and if she love you, how can you rob yourself of
so priceless a treasure?”
“ Oh, shallow and mean heart of man i” exclaimed
Zanoni, with unaccustomed passion and vehemence, “dost
thou conceive so little of love as not to know that it sacri-
ﬁces all --love itself —for the happiness of the thing it
loves ? Hear me i ” And Zanoni’s face grew pale. “ Hear

himself, ‘Why should this stranger care thus for me?”
“And yet," said Zanoni, “if I told thee that I could
initiate thee into the secrets of that magic which the
philosophy of the whole existing world treats as a chimera,

prolong life from age to age, the mystery of that attraction

subdue man as the serpent charms the bird; if I told thee
that all these it was mine to possess and to communicate,

vainly, like your ancestor, in the mysteries of the Order.

ﬁrst; this, perhaps, attracted thyself unconsciously, Son
of our Brotherhood, to me.”
“ If this be so, I command thee, in the name of the laws
thou obeyest, to receive me as thy pupil I”
“What do you ask ? ” said Zanoni, passionately.
“Learn ﬁrst the conditions. No Neophyte must have,
at his initiation, one aﬂ'ection or desire that chains him to
the world. He must be pure from the love of woman,
free from avarice and ambition, free from the dreams even
of art, or the hope of earthly fame. The ﬁrst sacriﬁce
thou must make is—Viola herself. And for what? For
an ordeal that the most daring courage only can encounter,
the most ethereal natures alone survive ! Thou art unﬁt
for the science that has made me and others what we are
or have been; for thy whole nature is one fear! ”
“ Fear i” cried Glyndon, coloring with resentment, and
rising to the full height of his stature.
“Fear 1 and the worst fear-fear of the world’s opinion ;
fear of the Nicots and the Mervales; fear of thine own
impulses when most generous; fear of thine own powers

With these words Zanoni abruptly left the artist—-
humbled, bewildered, and not convinced. He remained
alone with his thoughts, till he was aroused by the striking
of the clock; he then suddenly remembered Zanoni’s pre-
diction of the Cardinal’s death; and, seized with an intense
desire to learn its truth, he hurried into "the streets, — he
gained the Cardinal’s palace. Five minutes before noon
his Eminence had expired, after an illness of less than an
hour. Zanoni’s visit had occupied more time than the
illness of the Cardinal. Awed and perplexed, he turned
from the palace, and as he walked through the Chiaja, he
saw Jean Nicot emerge from the portals of the Print?

Chaldean Lore, and gleamed dimly through the darkened
knowledge of later disciples, laboring, like Psellus and
Iamblichus, to revive the embers of the ﬁre which burned
in the Hamar'in of the East. Though not _to us of an
aged and hoary world is vouchsafed the NAME which, so
say the earliest oracles of the earth, “rushes into the in-

through each new discovery of the philosopher and chem-

yet more mysterious agency of that Great Principle of
Life, which, if drawn from the Universe, would leave the
Universe a grave, were but the code in which the Thcurgy
of old sought the guides that led it to a legislation and
science of its own. To rebuild on words the fragments of

And it stirred in the virgin’s heart-this new, un-

affection of the pulse and the fancy, 0f the eye to the
Beautiful, of the ear to the Eloquent, or did it not justify
the notion she herself conceived of it—that it was born
not of the senses, that it was less of earthly and human
love than the effect of some wondrous, but not unholy
charm? I said that, from that day, in which, no longer

thine. I would give worlds, though we were apart, though
oceans rolled between us, to know the hour in which thy

is to the heart—that faith, rightly understood, extends
over all the works of the Creator, whom we can know
but through belief— that it embraces a tranquil conﬁ-

human sea. That faith I comprehend now. I reject all

IT was a small cabinet; the walls were covered with
pictures, one of which was worth more than the whole
lineage of the owner of the palace. Oh, yes! Zanoni
was right. The painter is a magician; the gold he at
least wrings from his crucible is no delusion. A Venetian
noble might be a fribble, or an assassin —a scoundrel, or
a dolt; Worthless, or worse than worthless, yet he might
have sat to Titian, and his portrait may be inestimable l
-—A few inches of painted canvas a thousand times more
valuable than a man with his veins and muscles, brain,
will, heart, and intellect!

In this cabinet sat a man of about three-and-forty;
dark-eyed, sallow, with short, prominent features, a mas-
sive conformation of jaw, and thick, sensual, but resolute
lips; this man was the Prince di—-——. His form, above
the middle height, and rather inclined to corpulence, was
clad in a loose dressing-robe of rich brocade. On a table
before him lay an old-fashioned sword and hat, a mask,
dice and dice-box, a portfolio, and an inkstand of silver
curiously carved.
“Well, Mascari,” said the Prince, looking up towards
his parasite who stood by the embrasure of the deep-set
barricadoed window—“ well, the Cardinal sleeps with his
fathers. I require comfort for the loss of so excellent a
relation; and where a more dulcet voice than Viola
Pisani’s ? ”
“ Is your Excellency serious ? So soon after the death
of his Eminence?”
“ It will be the less talked of, and I the less suspected.
Hast thou ascertained the name of the insolent who baﬂied
us that night, and advised the Cardinal the next day ? ”
“Not yet.” -
“Sapient Mascaril I will inform thee. It was the
strange Unknown."
‘ The Signor Zanoni 1 Are you sure, my Prince?”
"Mascari, yes. There is a tone in that man’s voice
that I never can mistake; so clear, and so commanding,
when I hear it I almost fancy there is such a thing as
censcicnce. However, we must rid ourselves of an imper-
tinent. Mascari, Signor Zanoni hath not yet honored

our poor house with his presence. He is a distinguished
stranger—we must give a banquet in his honor.”
“Ah ! and the Cyprus wine! The cyprus is a proper
emblem of the grave.”
“But this anon. I am superstitious: there are strange
stories of Zanoni’s power and foresight; remember the
death of Ughelli. No matter! though the Fiend were
his ally, he should not rob me of my prize; no, nor my
revenge.”
“Your Excellency is infatuated; the actress has be-
witched you.”
“ Maseari,” said the Prince with a haughty smile,
“through these veins rolls the blood of the old Visconti
-—of those who boasted that no woman ever escaped their
lust, and no man their resentment. The crown of my
fathers has shrunk into a gewgaw and a toy, —their am-
bition and their spirit are undecayed ! My honor is now
enlisted in this pursuit—Viola must be mine!”
“Another ambuscade ? ” said Maseari, inquiringly.
“ Nay, why not enter the house itself? the situation is
lonely, and the door is not made of iron.”
“ But what if, on her return home, she tell the tale of
our violence ? A house forced—a virgin stolen ! Reﬂect;
though the feudal privileges are not destroyed, even a
Visconti is not now above the law.”
“ Is he not, Mascari? Fool! in what age of the world,
even if the Madmen of France succeed in their chimeras,
will the iron of law not bend itself, like an osier twig. to
the strong hand of power and gold ? But look not so pale.

Mascari, I have foreplanned all things. The day that she
leaves this palace, she will leave it for France, with Mon-
sieur Jean Nicot.”
Before Mascari could reply, the gentleman of the cham-
ber announced the Signor Zanoni.
The Prince involuntarily laid his hand upon the sword
placed on the table, then with a smile at his own impulse,
rose, and met his visitor at the threshold, with all the
profuse and respectful courtesy of Italian simulation.
“ This is an honor highly prized,” said the Prince. “ I
have long desired to clasp the hand of one so dis-
tinguished.”
“And I give it in the spirit with which you seek it,”
replied Zanoni.
The Neapolitan bowed over the hand he pressed; but
as he touched it, a shiver came over him, and his heart
stood still. Zanoni bent on him his dark,'smiling eyes,
and then seated himself with a familiar air.
“Thus it is signed and sealed ; I mean our friendship,
noble Prince. And now I will tell you the object of my
visit. I ﬁnd, Excellency, that, unconsciously perhaps, we
are rivals. Can we not accommodate our pretensions?”
“ Ah I ” said the Prince, carelessly, “you then were the
cat alicr who robbed me of the reward of my chase. All
stratagems fair in love, as in war. Reconcile our preten-
sions l Well, here is the dice-box; let us throw for her.
He who casts the lowest shall resign his claim.”
“Is this a decision by which you will promise to be
bound ? ”

“Yes, on my faith.”
“ And for him who breaks his word so plighted, what
shall be the forfeit?”
“The sword lies next to the dice-box, Signor Zanoni.
Let him who stands not by his honor, fall by the sword.”
“And you invoke that sentence if either of us fail his
word ? Be it so ; let Signor Mascari cast for us.”
“Well said !--Mascari, the dice!”
The Prince threw himself back in his chair; and, world-
hardened as he was, could not suppress the glow of tri-
umph and satisfaction that spread itself over his features.
Mascari took up the three dice, and rattled them noisily
in the box. Zanoni, leaning his cheek on his hand, and
bending over the table, ﬁxed his eyes steadfastly on the
parasite; Mascari in vain struggled to extricate himself
from that searching gaze: he grew pale, and trembled-—
he put down the box.
“I give the ﬁrst throw to your excellency. Signor
Mascari, be pleased to terminate our suspense.”
Again Mascari took up the box ; again his hand shook,
so that the dice rattled within. He threw: the numbers
were sixteen.
“ It is a high throw,” said Zanoni, calmly; “neverthe-
less Signor Mascari, I do not despond.”
Mascari gathered up the dice, shook the box, and
rolled the contents once more on the table: the number
was the highest that can be thrown—eighteen.
The Prince darted a glance of ﬁre at his minion, who


## p. 215 (#223) ############################################

stood with gaping mouth, staring at the dice, and trem-
bling from head to foot.
“I have won, you see,” said Zanoni; “may we be
friends still ?”
“ Signor,” said the Prince, obviously struggling with
anger and confusion, “ the victory is yours. But pardon
me, you have spoken lightly of this young girl—will any-
thing tempt you to yield your claim?”
“ Ah, do not think so ill of my gallantry; and,” resumed
Zanoni, with a stern meaning in his voice, “ forget not
the forfeit your own lips have named.”
The Prince knit his brow, but constrained the haughty
answer that was his ﬁrst impulse.
“Enough l” he said, forcing a smile; “I yield. Let
me prove that I do not yield ungraeiously: will you favor
me with your presence at a little feast I propose to give
in honor,”—he added, with a sardonic mockery,—“ of the
elevation of my kinsman, the late Cardinal, of pious
memory, to the true seat of St. Peter?”
“It is, indeed, a happiness to hear one command of
yours I can obey.”
Zanoni then turned the conversation, talked lightly and
gaily, and soon afterwards departed.
“Villain I” then exclaimed the Prince, grasping Mas-
caii by the collar, “you betrayed mel”
“ I assure your Excellency that the dice were properly
arranged : he should have thrown twelve; but- he is the
Devil. and that’s the end of it.”

“ There is no time to be lost,” said the Prince, quitting
his hold of his parasite, who quietly re-settled his cravat.
“ My blood is up—I will win this girl, if I die for it i

LETTER FROM ZANONI TO MEJ'NOUR.
MY art is already dim and troubled. I have lost the
tranquillity which is power. I cannot inﬂuence the de-
cisions of those whom I would most guide to the shore;
I see them wander farther and deeper into the inﬁnite
ocean, where our barks sail evermore to the horizon that
ﬂies before us! Amazed and awed to ﬁnd that I can only
warn where I would control, I have looked into my own
soul. It is true that the desires of earth chain me to the
Present, and shut me from the solemn secrets which Intel~
lect, puriﬁed from all the dross of the clay, alone can
examine and survey. The stern condition on which we
hold our nobler and diviner gifts darkens our vision

towards the future of those for whom we know the human
inﬁrmities of jealousy, or hate, or love. Mejnour, all
around me is mist and haze; I have gone back in our
sublime existence; and from the bosom of the imperish-
able youth that blooms only in the spirit, springs up the
dark poison-ﬂower of human love. i
This man is not worthy of her—I know that truth;
yet in his nature are the seeds of good and greatness, if
the tares and weeds of worldly vanities and fears would
suffer them to grow. If she were his, and I had thus
transplanted to another soil the passion that obscures my
gaze and disarms my power, unseen, unheard, unrecog-
nized, I could watch over his fate, and secretly prompt
his deeds, and minister to her welfare through his own.
But time rushes onl Through the shadows that encircle
me, I see, gathering round her, the darkest dangers. No
choice but ﬂight—no escape, save with him or me. With

With me i Mejnour, canst thou wonder that I would save
her from myself? A moment in the life of ages—a bubble
on the shoreless sea. What else to me can be human
love? And in this exquisite nature of hers—more pure,
more spiritual, even in its young aﬁ'ections than ever here-
tofore the countless volumes of the heart, race after race,
have given to my gaze—there is yet a deep-buried feeling
that warns me of inevitable woe. Thou austere and re-
morseless Hierophant—thou who hast sought to convert

high and bold-even thou knowest, by horrible experience,
how vain the hope to banish fear from the heart of
woman. My life would be to her one marvel. Even if,
on the other hand, I sought to guide her path through
the realms of terror to the light, think of the Haunter
of the Threshold, and shudder with me at the awfu1
hazard l I have endeavored to ﬁll the Englishman’s am
bition with the true glory of his art; but the restless
spirit of his ancestor still seems to whisper in him, and
to attract to the spheres in which it lost its own wander-
ing way. There is a mystery in man’s inheritance from
his fathers. Peculiarities of the mind, as diseases of the
body, rest dormant for generations, to revive in some dis-
tant descendant, baﬂie all treatment and elude all skill.
Come to me from thy solitude amidst the wrecks of Rome 1
I pant for a living conﬁdant—for one who in the old
time has himself known jealousy and love. I have sought
commune with Adon-Ai : but his presence, that once in-
spired such heavenly content with knowledge, and so
serene a conﬁdence in destiny, now only troubles and per-
plexes me. From the height from which I strive to search
into the shadows of things to come, I see confused spectres
of menace and wrath. Methinks I behold a ghastly limit
to the wondrous existence I have held—methinks that,
after ages of the Ideal Life, I see my course merge into
the most stormy whirlpool of the Real. Where the stars
opened to me their gates, there looms a scaffold—thick
steams of blood rise as from a shambles. What is more

strange to me, a creature here, a very type of the false
ideal of common men—body and mind, a hideous mockery
of the art that shapes the Beautiful, and the desires that
seek the Perfect, ever haunts my vision amidst these per-
turbed and broken clouds of the fate to be. By that
shadowy scaffold it stands and gibbers at me, with lips
dropping slime and gore. Come, 0 friend of the far-
time; for me, at least, thy wisdom has not purged away
thy human affections. According to the bonds of our
solemn order, reduced now to thee and myself, lone sur-
vivors of so many haughty and glorious aspirants, thou
art pledged, too, to warn the descendant of those whom
thy counsels sought to initiate into the great secret in a
former age. The last of that bold Visconti, who was
once thy pupil, is the relentless persecutor of this fair
child. With thoughts of lust and murder, he is digging
his own grave ; thou mayest yet daunt him from his doom.
And I also mysteriously, by the same bond, am pledged
to obey, if he so command, a less guilty descendant of a
bafﬂed but nobler student. If he reject my counsel, and
insist upon the pledge, Mejnour, thou wilt have another
Neophyte. Beware of another victim! Come to me!
This will reach thee with all speed. Answer it by the
pressure of one hand that I can dare to clasp!

AMINTA, At. iv. So. i.
AT Naples, the tomb of Virgil, beetling over the cave
of Posilipo, is reverenced, not with the feelings that should
hallow the memory of the poet, but the awe that wraps
the memory of the magician. To his charms they ascribe
the hollowing of that mountain passage; and tradition yet
guards his tomb by the spirits he had raised to construct
the cavern. This spot, in the immediate vicinity of Viola’s .
home, had often attracted her solitary footsteps. She
had loved the dim and solemn fancies that beset her as
she looked into the lengthened gloom of the grotto, or,
ascending the tomb, gazed from the rock on the dwarfed
ﬁgures of the busy crowd that seemed to creep like insects
along the windings of the soil below; and now, at noon, ,
she bent thither her thoughtful way; She threaded the
narrow path, she passed the gloomy vineyard that clambers
up the rock, and gained the lofty spot, green with moss
and luxuriant foliage, where the dust of him who yet
soothes and eleVates the minds of men is believed to rest.
From afar rose the huge fortress of St. Elmo, frowning

darkly amidst spires and domes that glittered in the sun.
Lulled in its azure splendor lay the Siren’s sea; and the
grey smoke of Vesuvius, in the clear distance, soared like
a moving pillar into the lucid sky. Motionless on the
brink of the precipice, Viola looked upon the lovely and
living world that stretched below; and the sullen vapor
of Vesuvius fascinated her eye yet more than the scattered
gardens, or the gleaming Caprea, smiling amidst the smiles
of the sea. She heard not a step that had followed her
on her path, and started to hear a voice at hand. So
sudden was the apparition of the form that stood by her
side, emerging from the bushes that clad the crags, and
so singular did it harmonize in its uncouth ugliness with
the wild nature of the scene immediately around her, and
the wizard traditions of the place, that the color left her
cheek, and a faint cry broke from her lips.
“Tush, pretty trembler i —do not be frightened at my
face,” said the man, with a bitter smile. “After three
months’ marriage, there is no difference between ugliness
and beauty. Custom is a great levellcr. I was coming
to your house when I saw you leave it; so, as I have
matters of importance to communicate, I ventured to fol-
low your footsteps. My name is Jean Nicot, a name
already favorably known as a French artist. The art of
painting and the art of music are nearly connected, and
the stage is an altar that unites the two.”
There was something frank and unembarrassed in the
man’s address, that served to dispel the fear his appear-
ance had occasioned. He seated himself, as he spoke,
19*

on a crag beside her, and, looking up steadily into her
face, continued:—
“You are very beautiful, Viola Pisani, and I am not
surprised at the number of your admirers. If I presume
to place myself in the list, it is because I am the only one
who loves thee honestly, and wooes thee fairly. Nay, look
not so indignant! Listen to me. Has the Prince di

ever spoken to thee of marriage ?— or the beautiful im-
postor Zanoni ?— or the blue-eyed Englishman, Clarence
Glyndon? It is marriage,—it is a home,- it is safety,
—it is reputation, that I offer to thee. And these last,
when the straight form grows crooked, and the bright
eyes dim. What say you?” and he attempted to seize
her hand.
Viola shrunk from him, and silently turned to depart.
He rose abruptly, and placed himself on her path.
“Actress, you must hear me ! Do you know what this
calling of the stage is in the eyes of prejudice—that is, of
the common opinion of mankind? It is to be a Princess
before the lamps, and a Pariah before the day. No man
believes in your virtue, no man credits your vows; you
are the puppet that they consent to trick out with tinsel
for their amusement, not an idol for their worship. Are
you so enamonred of this career, that you scorn even to
think of security and honor? Perhaps you are different
from what you seem. Perhaps you laugh at the prejudice
that would degrade you, and would wisely turn it to ad-
vantage. Speak frankly to me : I have no prejudice

either. Sweet one, I am sure we should agree. Now, this
Prince di-—-, I have a message from him. Shall I deliver
it ? ” '
Never had Viola felt as she felt then ; never had he
so thoroughly seen all the perils of her forlorn condition
and her fearful renown. Nicot continued :—
“Zanoni would but amuse himself with thy vanity; ‘
Glyndon would despise himself, if he offered thee his name
-—and thee, if thou wouldst accept it; but the Prince
di

is in earnest, and he is wealthy. Listen l”
And Nicot approached his lips to her, and hissed a
sentence which she did not suﬂ'er him to complete. She
darted from him with one glance of unutterable disdain.
As he strove to regain his hold of her arm, he lost his
footing, and fell down the sides of the rock, till, bruised
and lacerated, a pine-branch saved him from the yawning
abyss below. She heard his exclamation of rage and pain,
as she bounded down the path, and, without once turning
to look behind, regained her home. By the porch stood
Glyndon, conversing with Gionetta. She passed him
abruptly, entered the house, and, sinking on the ﬂoor,
wept loud and passionately.
Glyndon, who had followed her in surprise, vainly sought
to soothe and calm her. She would not reply to his ques-
tions; she did not seem to listen to his protestations of
love, till suddenly, as Nicot’s terrible picture ofthe world’s
iudgment of th at profession, which to her younger thoughts
had seemed the service of Song and the Beautiful, forced

itself upon her, she raised her face from her hands, and
looking steadily upon the Englishman, said, “False one,
dost thou talk to me of love?”
“ By my henor, words fail to tell thee how I love I”
“Wilt thou give me thy home ?—thy name? Dost
thou woo me as thy wife?” And at that moment, had
Glyndon answered as his better angel would have coun-
/
selled, perhaps, in that revolution of her whole mind,
which the words of Nicot had effected, which made her
despise her very self, sickeu of her lofty dreams, despair
of the future, and distrust her whole ideal,— perhaps, I
say, in restoring her self-esteem, he would have won her
conﬁdence, and ultimately secured her love. But, against
the prompting of his nobler nature, rose up at that sudden
question all those doubts which, as Zanoni had so well
implied, made the true enemies of his soul. Was he thus
suddenly to be entangled into a snare laid for his cre-
dulity by deceivers? Was she not instructed to seize the
moment to force him into an avowal which prudence must
repent ? Was not the great Actress rehearsing a premed-
itated part? He turned round, as these thoughts, the
children of the world, passed across him, for he literally
fancied that he heard the sarcastic laugh of Mervale with-
out. Nor was he deceived. Mervale was passing by
the threshold, and Gionetta had told him his friend was
within. Who does not know the effect of the world’s
laugh ? Mervale was the personation of the world. The
whole world seemed to shout derision in those ringing

tones. He drew back --he recoiled. Viola followed him
with her earnest, impatient eyes. At last, he faltered
forth,—“Do all of thy profession, beautiful Viola, exact
marriage as the sole condition of love?” Oh, bitter
question 1 Oh, poisoned taunt! He repented it the
moment after. He was seized with remorse of reason, of
feeling, and of conscience. He saw her form shrink, as
it were, at his cruel words. He saw the color come and
go, to leave the writhing lips like marble ; and then, with
a sad, gentle look of self-pity, rather than reproach, she
pressed her hands tightly to her bosom, and said,»—
“ He was right! Pardon me, Englishman; I see now
indeed, that I am the Pariah and the outcast.”
“ Hear me. I retract. Viola, Violal it is for you to
forgive l ” ,
But Viola waved him from her, and smiling mournfully,
as she passed him by, glided from the chamber; and he
did not dare to detain her.

WHEN Glyndon found himself without Viola’s house,
Mervale, still loitering at the door, seized his arm. Glyn.
don shook him 011' abruptly.
“ Thou and thy counsels,” said he, bitterly, “ have made
me a coward and a wreteh. But I will go home—I will
write to her. I will pour out my whole soul; she will

Mervale, who was a man of imperturbable temper,
arranged his ruﬂles, which his friend’s angry gesture had
a little discomposed, and not till Glyndon had exhausted
himself awhile by passionate exclamations and reproaches,
did the experienced angler begin to tighten the line. He
then drew from Glyndon the! explanation of what had
passed, and artfully sought not to irritate, but soothe him.

stronger moral notions than are common amongst the

dishonorable intentions with regard to the actress.
“Because I would not have her thy wife, I never dreamed
that thou shouldst degrade her to thy mistress. Better
of the two an imprudent match than an illicit connection
But pause yet, do not act on the impulse of the moment.“
“But there is no time to lose. I have promised to
Zanoni to give him my answer by to-morrow night. Later
than that time, all option ceases.”
“Ah i” said Mervale, “this seems suspicious. Explain
yourself. ”
And Glyndon, in the earnestness of his passion, told
his friend what had passed between himself and Zanoni
--suppressing only, he scarce knew why, the reference to
his ancestor and the mysterious brotherhood.
This recital gave to Mervale all the advantage he could
desire. Heavens l with what sound, shrewd common sense

because Zanoni, a mere stranger, told him with a grave
face that he must decide before the clock struck a certain
hour Y
“ Do this at least,” said Mervale, reasonably enough,
—“wait till the time expires; it is but another day.

Baﬂie Zanoni. He tells thee that he will meet thee before
midnight to-morrow, and deﬁes thee to avoid him. Pooh i

unless he be indeed the Devil, he cannot possibly ﬁnd us.
Show him that you will not be led blindfold even into an
act that you meditate yourself. Defer to write to her, or
to see her, till after to-morrow. This is all I ask. Then
visit her, and decide for yourself.”
Glyndon was staggered. He could not combat the
reasonings of his friend; he was not convinced, but he
hesitated; and at'that moment Nicot passed them. He
turned round, and stopped, as he saw Glyndon.
“Well, and do you think still of the Pisani?”
“Yes; and you —”
“ Have seen and conversed with her. She shall be
Madame Nicot before this day week ! I am going to the
café, in the Toledo; and bark ye, when next you meet
your friend Signor Zanoni, tell him that he has twice
crossed my path. Jean Nicot, though a painter, is a
plain, honest man, and always pays his debts.”
“ It is a good doctrine in money matters,” said Mer-
vale; “as to revenge, it is not so moral, and certainly
not so wise. But is it in your love that Zanoni has
crossed your path? How that, if your suit prosper so
well ?”
“Ask Viola Pisani that question. Bah! Glyndon, she
is a prude only to thee. But I have no prejudices. Once
more, farewell.”

now ?”
“This man must lie.”
“ Will you write to her at once?”
“ No ; if she be really playing a game, I could renounce
her without a sigh. I will watch her closely; and at all
events, Zanoni shall not be the master of my fate. Let

EARLY the next morning the young Englishmen mounted
their horses, and took the road towards Baiee. Glyndon
left word at his hotel, that if Signor Zanoni sought him,
it was in the neighborhood of that once celebrated water-
ing-place of the ancients that he should be found.
They passed by Viola’s house, but Glyndon resisted
the temptation of pausing there ; and after threading the

grotto of Posilipo, they wound by a circuitous route
back into the suburbs of the city, and took the opposite
road, which conducts t0 Portici and Pompeii. It was
late at noon when they arrived at the former of these
places. Here they halted to dine ; for Mervale had heard
much of the excellence of the macaroni at Portici, and
Mervale was a ban vi'vant.
They put up at an inn of very humble pretensions, and
dined under an awning. Mervale was more than usually
gay; he pressed the Lacrima upon his friend, and con-
versed gaily.
“Well, my dear friend, we have foiled Signor Zanoni
in one of his predictions at least. You will have no faith
in him hereafter.”
“The ides are come, not gone.”
“ Tush i If he be the soothsayer, you are not the Caesar.
It is your vanity that makes you credulous. Thank Heaven,
I do not think myself of such importance that the ope-
rations of nature should be changed in order to frighten
me.”
“ But why should the operations of nature be changed?
There may be a deeper philosophy than we dream of—a
philosophy that discovers the secrets of nature, but does
not alter, by penetrating, its courses.”
“Ah! you relapse into your heretical credulity; you
seriously suppose Zanoni to be a prophet—a reader of
the future; perhaps an associate of genii and spirits l "'
Here the landlord, a little, fat, oily fellow, came up
with a fresh bottle of Lacrima. He hoped their Excel

lencies were pleased. He was most touched—-touched to
the heart, that they liked the macaroni. Were their Ex-
cellencies going to Vesuvius? There was a slight erup—
tion; they could not see it where they were, but it was
pretty, and would be prettier still after sunset.
“A capital idea!” cried Mervale. “What say you,
Glyndon ? ”
"I have not yet seen an eruption; I should like it
much.”
“ But is there no danger ? ” asked the prudent Mervale.
“ Oh, not at all ; the mountain is very civil at present.
It only plays a little, just to amuse their Excellencies the
English.”
“Well, order the horses, and bring the bill; we will
go before it is dark. Clarence, my friend—nunc est
bibendum; but take care of the pede libero, which will
scarce do for walking on lava!”
The bottle was ﬁnished, the bill paid; the gentlemen
mounted, the landlord bowed, and they bent their way,
in the cool of the delightful evening, towards Resiua.
The wine, perhaps the excitement of his thoughts,
animated Glyndon, whose unequal spirits were, at times,
high and brilliant as those of a school-boy released ; and
the laughter of the northern tourists sounded oft and mer-
rily along the melancholy domains of buried cities.

lustre. In various streaks and streamlets, the fountain
of ﬂame rolled down the dark summit, and the English-
men began to feel increase upon them, as they ascended,
that sensation of solemnity and awe which makes the very
atmosphere that surrounds the Giant of the Plains of the
Antique Hades.
It was night, when, leaving the mules, they ascended
on foot, accompanied by their guide, and a peasant who
bore a rude torch. The guide was a conversable, garrn-
lous fellow, like most of his country and his calling; and
Mervale, who possessed a sociable temper, loved to amuse-
or to instruct himself on every incidental occasion.
“Ah l Excellency,” said the guide, “ your countrymen
have a strong passion for the volcano. Long life to them 1
they bring us plenty of money. If our fortunes depended
on the Neapolitans, we should starve.”
“True, they have no curiosity,” said Mervale. “ Do
you remember, Glyndon, the contempt with which that
old Count said to us, ‘ You will go to Vesuvius, I suppose?
I have never been; why should I go? you have cold, you
have hunger, you have fatigue, you have danger, and all
for nothing but to see ﬁre, which looks just as well in a
brazier as on a mountain.’ Ha! ha! the old fellow was .
right.”
“But, Excellency,” said the guide, “that is not all:
some cavaliers think to ascend the mountain without our
help. I am sure they deserve to tumble into the crater."
“They must be bold fellows to go alone ;-yon don’t
often ﬁnd such.” i

" Sometimes among the French, Signor. But the other
night—I never was so frightened— I had been with an
English party; and a lady had left a pocket-book on the
mountain, where she had been sketching. She offered me
a handsome sum to return for it, and bring it to herat
Naples, So I went in the evening. I found it, sure
enough; and was about to return, when I saw a ﬁgure
that seemed to emerge from the crater itself. The air
there was so pestiferous, that I could not have conceived
a human creature could breathe it, and live. I was so
astounded that I stood still as a stone, till the ﬁgure came
over the hot ashes, and stood before me, face to face.
Santa Maria, what a head!”
“ What I hideous ? ”
“N0; so beautiful, but so terrible. It had nothing -
human in its aspect.”
“And what said the salamander?”
“ Nothing 1 It did not even seem to perceive me, though
I was near as I am to you: but its eyes seemed to emerge
prying into the air. It passed by me quickly, and, walking -
across a stream of burning lava, soon vanished on the
other side of the mountain. I was curious and foolhardy,
and resolved to see if I could bear the atmosphere which
this visitor had left; but, though I did not advance within
thirty yards of the spot at which he had ﬁrst appeared,
I was driven back by a vapor that well-nigh stiﬂed me.

_“ Now will I. lay a wager that you fancy this ﬁre-king
must be Zanoni,” whispered Mervale, laughing.

The little party had now arrived nearly at the summit
of the mountain; and unspeakably grand was the spec-
tacle on which they gazed. From the crater arose a vapor,
intensely dark, that overspread the whole background of
the heavens; in the centre whereof rose a ﬂame, that
assumed a form singularly beautiful. It might have been
compared to a crest of gigantic feathers, the diadem of
the mountain, high-arched, and drooping downward, with
the hues delicately shaded 01?, and the whole shifting and
tremulous as the plumage on a warrior’s helmet. The
glare of the ﬂame spread, luminous and crimson, over the
dark and rugged ground on which they stood, and drew
an innumerable variety of shadows from crag and hollow.
An oppressive and sulphureous exhalation served to in-
crease the gloomy and sublime terror of the place. But
on turning from the mountain, and towards the distant
and unseen ocean, the contrast was wonderfully great;
the heavens serene and blue, the stars still and calm as
the eyes of Divine Love. It was as if the realms of the
- opposing principles of Evil and of Good were brought in
one view before the gaze of man i Glyndon—once more
the enthusiast, the artist— was enchained and entranced
by emotions vague and undeﬁnable, half of delight and
half of pain. Leaning on the shoulder of his friend, he
gazed around him, and heard with deepening awe, the
rumbling of the earth below, the wheels and voices of the
Ministry of Nature in her darkest and most inscrutable
recess. Suddenly as a bomb from a shell, a huge stone

was ﬂung hundreds of yards up from the jaws of the era-
ter, and, falling with a mighty crash upon the rock below,
split into ten thousand fragments, which bounded down
the sides of the mountain, sparkling and groaning as they
went. One of these, the largest fragment, struck the
narrow space of soil between the Englishmen and the
guide, not three feet from the spot where the former stood.
Mervale uttered an exclamation of terror, and Glyndon
held his breath, and shuddered.
“Diavolo!” cried the guide, “Descend, Excellencies
—descendl we have not a moment to lose: follow me
close I”
So saying, the guide and the peasant ﬂed with as much
swiftness as they were able to bring to bear. Mervale,
ever more prompt and ready than his friend, imitated
their example ; and Glyndon, more confused than alarmed,
followed close. But they had not gone many yards, before,
with a rushing and sudden blast, came from the crater an
enormous volume of vapor. It pursued—it overtook—
it overspread them. It swept the light from the heavens.
All was abrupt and utter darkness; and through the
gloom was heard the shout of the guide, already distant,
and lost in an instant amidst the sound of the rushing
gust and the groans of the earth beneath. Glyndon
paused. He was separated from his friend—from the
guide. He was alone—with the Darkness and the Terror.
The vapor rolled sullenly away ; the form or the plumed
ﬁre was again dimly visible, and its struggling and per-

turbed reﬂection again shed a glow over the horrors of
the path. Glyndon recovered himself, and sped onward.
Below, he heard the voice of Mervale calling on him,
though he no longer saw his form. The sound served as
a guide. Dizzy and breathless, he bounded forward;
when—hark l—a sullen, slow, rolling sounded in his earl

ﬂowed its course: it had opened itself a channel amidst
the furrows of the mountain. The stream pursued him

feet, upon a crag, that, to the right, broke the scathed
and blasted level of the soil. The stream rolled beside
and beneath him, and then, taking a sudden wind round
the spot on which he stood, interposed its liquid ﬁre—a
broad and impassable barrier between his resting-place
and escape. There he stood, cut oﬁ' from descent, and
with no alternative but to retrace his steps towards the
rater, and thence seek, without guide or clue, some other
pathway.
For a moment his courage left him : he cried in despair,
and in that over-strained pitch of voice which is never '
heard afar oil“, to the guide—to Mervale, to return to aid
him.
No answer came ; and the Englishman, thus abandoned
solely to his own resources, felt his spirit~and energy rise
against the danger. He turned back, and ventured as

far towards the crater as the noxious exhalation would
permit; then, gazing below, carefully and deliberately,
he chalked out for himself a path, by which be trusted to
shun the'direction the ﬁre-stream had taken ; and trod
ﬁrmly and Quickly over the crumbling and heated strata.
He had proceeded about ﬁfty yards, when be halted
abruptly; an unspeakable and unaccountable horror, not
hitherto experienced amidst all his peril, came over him. -
He shook in every limb ; his muscles refused his will—he
felt, as it were, palsied and death-stricken. The horror,
I say, was unaccountable, for the path seemed clear and
safe. The ﬁre, above and behind, burned clear and far;
and beyond, the stars lent him their cheering guidance.
No obstacle was visible—no danger seemed at hand. As
thus, spell-bound and panic-stricken, he stood chained to
the soil—his breast heaving; large drops rolling down
his brow; and his eyes starting wildly from their sockets
--he saw before him, at some distance, gradually shaping
itself more and more distinctly to his gaze, a Colossal
Shadow—a shadow that seemed partially borrowed from
the human shape, but immeasurably above the human
stature; vague, dark, almost formless; and differing, he
could not tell where, or why, not only from the propor-
tions, but also from the limbs and outline of man.
The glare of the volcano, that seemed to shrink and
collapse from this gigantic and appalling apparition,
nevertheless threw its light, redly and steadily, upon an-
other shape that stood beside, quiet and motionless ; and

it was, perhaps, the contrast of these two things,—the
Being and the Shadow,—that impressed the beholder
with the diﬁ‘ereuce between them—the Man and the
Superhuman. It was but for a moment, —nay, for the
tenth part of a moment,-that this sight was permitted
to the wanderer. A second eddy of sulphureous vapor,
mm the volcano, yet more rapidly, yet more densely than
, its predecessor, rolled over the mountain; and either the
nature of the exhalation, or the excess of his own dread,
was such, that Glyndon, after one wild gasp for breath,
fell senseless on the earth.

MERVALE and the Italians arrived in safety at the spot
where they had left the mules; and not till they had re-
covered their own alarm and breath did they think of
Glyndon. But then, as the minutes passed, and be ap-
peared not, Mervale, whose heart was as good, at least,
as human hearts are in general, grew seriously alarmed.
He insisted on returning, to search for his friend ; and by
dint of prodigal promises, prevailed at last on the guide
to accompany him. The lower part of the mountain lay

calm and white in the starlight; and the guide’s practised
eye could discern all objects on the surface, at a consider-
able distance. They had not, however, gone very far,
before they perceived two forms, slowly approaching
towards them.
As they came near, Mervale recognized the form of his
friend. “ Thank Heaven, he is safe l” he cried, turning
to the guide.
“ Holy angels, befriend us l ” said the Italian, trembling
—“ Behold the very being that crossed me last Friday
night. It is he! but his face is human now I”
“ Signor Inglese,” said the voice of Zanoni, as Glyn-
don—pale, wan, and silent—returned passively the joyous
greeting of Mervale, “ Signor Inglese, I told your friend
that we should meet to-night. You see you have not
foiled my prediction.”
“ But how ?—but where ? ” stammered Mervale, in great
confusion and surprise.
“I found your friend stretched on the ground, over-
powered by the mephitic exhalation of the crater. I bore
him to a purer atmosphere; and, as I know the mountain
well, I have conducted him safely to you. This is all our
history. You see, sir, that were it not for that prophecy
which you desired to frustrate, your friend would, ere
this time, have been a corpse: one minute more, and the
vapor had done its work. Adieu; good night, and plea-
sant dreams.”
“But, my preserver, you will not leave us i ” said Glyn-

don, anxiously, and speaking for the ﬁrst time. “Will
you not return with us?”
Zanoni paused, and drew Glyndon aside. “Young
man,” said he, gravely, “it is necessary that we should
again meet to-night. It is necessary that you should, ere
the ﬁrst hour of morning, decide on your own fate. I
know that you have insulted her whom you profess to
love. It is not too late to repent. Consult not your
friend;-—he is sensible and wise; but not now is his
wisdom needed. There are times in life, when, from the
imagination, and not the reason, should wisdom come-
this, for you, is one of them. I ask not your answer now.
Collect your thoughts—recover your jaded and scattered
spirits. It wants two hours of midnight. Before mid-
night I will be with you.”
“Incomprehensible being!” replied the Englishman,
“I would leave the life‘you have preserved in your own
hands; but what I have seen this night has swept even
Viola from my thoughts. A ﬁercer desire than that of
love burns in my veins—the desire not to resemble but to
surpass my kind—the desire to penetrate and to share
the secret of your own existence-the desire of a preter-
natural knowledge and unearthly power. I make my
choice. In my ancestor’s name, I adjure and remind thee
of thy pledge. Instruct me; school me ; make me thine ;
and I surrender to thee at once, and without a murmur,
the woman whom, till I saw thee, I would have deﬁed a
world to Jbtain."

“ I bid thee consider well; on the _one hand, Viola, a
tranquil home, a happy and serene life. On the other
hand, all is darkness—darkness, that even these eyes
cannot penetrate.”
“But thou hast told me, that if I wed Viola, I must
be contented with the common existence,—if I refuse, it
:s to aspire to thy knowledge and thy power.”
“Vain man l—knowledge and power are not happi-
ness.”
“But they are better than happiness. Say !—-if I
marry ,Viola, wilt thou be my master—my guide? Say
this, and I am resolved.”
“It were impossible.”
“Then I renounce her] I renounce love. I renounce
lappiness. Welcome solitude-welcome despair; if they
are the entrances to thy dark and sublime secret.”
“ I will not take thy answer now. Before the last hour
of night, thou shalt give it in one word—ay or no l Fare-
well till then.”
Zanoni waved his hand; and descending rapidly, was
seen no more.
Glyndon rejoined his impatient and wondering friend ;
but Mervale, gazing on his face, saw that a great change
had passed there. The ﬂexile and dubious expression of
youth was for ever gone. The features were locked, rigid,
and stern; and so faded was the natural bloom, that an
hour seemed to have done the work of’years.

ON returning from Vesuvius or Pompeii, you enter
Naples through its most animated, its most Neapolitan
quarter—through that quarter in which Modern life most
closely resembles the Ancient; and in which, when, on a
fair day, the thoroughfare swarms alike with Indolence
and Trade, you are impressed at once with the recollec
tion of that restless, lively race, from which the popu
lation of Naples derives its origin; so that in. one day
you may see at Pompeii the habitations of a remote age;
and on the Mole, at Naples, you may imagine you behold
the very beings with whom those habitations had been
peopled.
But now, as the Englishmen rode slowly through the
deserted streets, lighted but by the lamps of heaven, all
the gaiety of day was hushed and breathless. Here and
there, stretched under a portico or a dingy booth, were
sleeping groups of houseless Lazzaroni: a tribe now
merging its indolent individuality amidst an energetic and
active population.

The Englishmen rode on in silence; for Glyndon neither
appeared to heed nor hear the questions and comments
of Mervale, and Mervale himself was almost as weary as
the jaded animal he bestrode.
Suddenly the silence of earth and ocean was broken by
the sound of a distant clock, that proclaimed the quarter
preceding the last' hour of night. Glyndon started from
his reverie, and looked anxiously round. As the ﬁnal
stroke died, the noise of hoofs rung on the broad stones
of the pavement ; and from a narrow street to the right,
emerged the form of a solitary horseman. He neared the
Englishmen, and Glyndon recognized the features and
mien of Zanoni.
“ What ! do we meet again, Signor ? ” said Mervale, in
a vexed but drowsy tone.
“Your friend and I have business together,” replied
Zanoni, as he wheeled his steed to the side of Glyndon.
“ But it will be soon transacted. Perhaps you, sir, will
ride on to your hotel.”
“Alone!”
“There is no danger l” returned Zanoni, with a slight
expression of disdain in his voice.
“None to me; —but to Glyndon ?”
“Danger from me! Ah, perhaps you are right.”
“Go on, my dear Mervale,” said Glyndon: “I will
join you before you reach the hotel.”
Mervale nodded, whistled, and pushed his horse into a
kind of amble.
“ Now your answer— quick I”

“ I have-decided. The love of Viola has vanished from
my heart. The pursuit is over.”
“ You have decided?”
“I have;—and now my reward.”
“Thy reward 1 Well ; ere this hour to-morrow, it shall
await thee.”
Zanoni gave the rein to his horse ; it sprang forward
with a bound; the sparks ﬂew from its hoofs, and horse
and rider disappeared amidst the shadows of the street
whence they had emerged.
Mervale was surprised to see his friend by his side, a
minute after they had parted.
“What has passed between you and Zanoni ?”
“ Mervale, do not ask me to-nightl I am in a dream.”
“ I do not wonder at it, for even I am in a sleep. Let
us push on.”
In the retirement of his chamber, Glyndon sought to
re-collect his thoughts. He sat down on the foot of his
bed, and pressed his hands tightly to his throbbing tem-
ples. The events of the last few hours; the apparition
of the gigantic and shadowy Companion of the Mystic,
amidst the ﬁres and clouds of Vesuvius; the strange en-
counter with Zanoni himself, on a spot in which he could
never, by ordinary reasoning, have calculated on ﬁnding
Glyndon, ﬁlled his mind with emotions, in which terror
and awe the least prevailed. A ﬁre, the train of which
had been long laid, was lighted at his heart—the asbestos-
ﬁre, that, once lit, is never to be quenched. All his early
aspirations—his young ambition —his longings for the


## p. 245 (#253) ############################################

zanonr. 245
laurel, were merged in one passionate yearning to over-
pass the bounds of the common knowledge of man, and
reach that solemn spot, between two worlds, on which the
mysterious stranger appeared to have ﬁxed his home.
Far from recalling with renewed aﬂ'right the remem-
brance of the apparition that had so appalled him, the
recollection only served to kindle and concentrate his
curiosity into a burning focus. He had said aright—lovs
had vanished from his heart; there was no longer a
serene space amidst its disordered elements for human
affection to move and breathe'. The enthusiast was rapt
from this earth; and he would have surrendered all that
mortal beauty ever promised, that mortal hope ever
whispered, for one hour with'Zanoni beyond the portals
of the visible world.
He rose, oppressed and fevered with the new thoughts
that raged within him, and threw open his casement for
air. The ocean lay suﬁ'used in the starry light, and the
stillness of the heavens never more eloquently preached
the morality of repose to the madness of earthly passions.
But such was Glyndon’s mood, that their very hush only
served to deepen the wild desires that preyed upon his
soul; and the solemn stars, that are mysteries in them-
selves, seemed, by a kindred sympathy, to agitate the
wings of the spirit no longer contented with its cage. As
he gazed, a Star shot from its brethren, and vanished
from the depth of space!

Rouao AND JnLln'r.
THE young actress and Gionetta had returned from the
theatre; and Viola, fatigued and exhausted, had thrown
herself on a sofa, while Gionetta busied herself with the
long tresses, which, released from the ﬁllet that bound
them, half-concealed the form of the actress, like a veil
of threads of gold. As she smoothed the luxuriant locks,
the old nurse ran gossiping on about the little events of
the night, the scandal and politics of the scenes and the
tire-room. Gionetta was a worthy soul. Almanzor, in
Dryden’s tragedy of “Almahide,” did not change sides
with more gallant indifference than the exemplary nurse.
She was at last grieved and scandalized that Viola had
not selected one chosen cavalier. But the choice she left
wholly to her fair charge. Zegri or Abencerrage, Glyn-
don or Zanoni, it had been the same to her, except that
the rumors she had collected respecting the latter, com-
bined with his own recommendations of his rival, had
given her preference to the Englishman. She interpreted
ill the impatient and heavy sigh with which Viola greeted
her praises of Glyndon, and her wonder that he had of
late so neglected his attentions behind the scenes, and she

exhausted all her powers of panegyric upon the supposed
object of the sigh. “And then too,” she said, “if nothing
else were to be said against the other Signor, it is enough
that he is about to leave Naples.”
“Leave Naples !— Zanoni ? ”
“ Yes, darling i In passing by the Mole to-day, there

sailors say that they are to be prepared to sail with the

The time had already passed when the girl could con-
ﬁde in Gionetta. Her thoughts had advanced to that
point when the heart recoils from all conﬁdence, and feels
that it cannot be comprehended. Alone now, in the prin-
cipal apartment of the house, she paced its narrow boun-
daries with tremulous and agitated steps : she recalled the
frightful suit of Nicot,—the injurious taunt of Glyndon;
and she sickened at the remembrance of the hollow ap-
plauses, which, bestowed on the actress, not the woman,
'only subjected her to contumely and insult. In that room
the recollection of her-father’s death, the withered laurel
and the broken chords, rose chillingly before her. Hers,
she. felt, was a yet gloomier fate—the chords may break
while the laurel is yet green. The lamp, waning in its
socket, burned pale and dim, and her eyes instinctively
turned from the darker corner of the room. Qrphan l by
the hearth of thy parents, dost thou fear the presence of
the dead?

And was Zanoni indeed about to quit Naples? Should
she see him no more? Oh, fool, to think that there was
grief in any other thoughtl The Past l—that was gonel
The Future l—there was no Future to her, Zanoni absent l
But this was the night of the third day on which Zanoni
had told her that, come .what might, he would visit her
again. It was, then, if she might believe him, some ap-
pointed crisis in her fate ; and how should she tell him of
Glyndon’s hateful words? The pure and the proud mind
can never conﬁde its wrongs to another, only its triumphs
and its happiness. But at that late hour would Zanoni
visit her—could she receive him ? Midnight was at hand.
Still in undeﬁned suspense, in intense anxiety, she lingered
in the room. The quarter before midnight sounded, dull
and distant. All was still, and she was about to pass to
her sleeping-room, when she heard the hoofs of ahorse at
full speed; the sound ceased; there was a knock at the
door. Her heart beat violently; but fear gave way to
another sentiment when she heard a voice, too well known,
calling on her name. She paused, and then with the fear-
lessness of innocence, descended, and unbarred the door. I
Zanoni entered with a light and hasty step. His horse-
man’s cloak ﬁtted tightly to his noble form ; and his broad
hat threw a gloomy shade over his commandingfeatures.
The girl followed him into the room she had just left,
trembling and blushing deeply, and stood before him with
the lamp she held shining upward on her cheek and the
long hair that fell like a shower of light over the half-clad
shoulders and heaving bust

“Viola,” said Zanoni, in a voice that spoke oeep emo-

He grasped her hand passionately as he dropped on
his knee, and lookedv up into her face with his bright be-
seeching eyes.
“Fly with thee l” said 'Viola, scarce believing her
senses.
“With me. _ Name, fame, honor—all will be sacriﬁced
if thou dost not.”
“ Then—then,” said the wild girl, falteringly, and turn-
ing aside her face ; “then I am not indiﬂ'erent to thee T'—
thou wouldst not give me to another?”
Zanoni was silent; but his breast heaved, his cheeks
ﬂushed, his eyes darted dark and impassioned ﬁre.
“ Speak l” exclaimed Viola, in jealous suspicion of his
silence.
“ Indifferent to me i No; but I dare not yet say that
I love thee.”
“Then what matters my fate?” said Viola, turning
pale, and shrinking from his side; “leave me—I fear no
danger. My life, and therefore my honor, is in mine own
hands.”
“ Be not so mad,” said Zanoni. “ Hark! do you hear

“Why dost thou care for me I? ” said the girl, bitterly.
“ Thou hast read my heart; thou knowest that thou art
become the lord of my destiny. But to be bound beneath
the weight of a cold obligation; to be the beggar on the
eyes of Indifference; to cast myself on one who loves me
not; that were indeed the vilest sin of my sex. Ah, Za-
noni, rather let me die 1 ”
She had thrown back her clustering hair from her face
while she spoke; and as she now stood, with her arms
drooping mournfully, and her hands clasPed together with
the proud bitterness of her wayward spirit, giving new
zest and charm to her singular beauty, it was impossible
to conceive a sight more irresistible to the eye and the
heart.
“ Tempt me not to thine own danger—perhaps destruc-
tion 1 ” exclaimed Zanoni, in faltering accents. “Thou
canst not dream of what thou wouldst demand—come l”
and, advancing, he wound his arm around her waist.
“Come, Viola; believe at least in my friendship, my

honor, my protection-
“And not thy love,” said the Italian, turning on him
her reproachful eyes. Those eyes met his, and he could
not withdraw from the charm of their gaze. He felt her
heart throbbing beneath his own ; her breath came warm
upon his cheek. He trembled—He! the lofty, the mys-
terious Zanoni, who seemed to stand aloof from his race.
With a deep and burning sigh, he murmured, “Viola, l

love thee 1 Ch 1” he continued, passionately, and releas-
ing his hold, he threw himself abruptly at her feet, “I
no more command ;-_as woman should be wooed, I woo
thee. From the ﬁrst glance of those eyes—from the
ﬁrst sound of thy voice, thou becamest too fatally dear to
me. Thou speakest of fascination—it lives and it breathes
in thee l I ﬂed from Naples to ﬂy from thy presence-
it pursued me. Months, years passed, and thy sweet face
still shone upon my heart. I returned, because I pictured
thee alone and sorrowful in the world: and knew that
dangers, from which I might save thee, were gathering
near thee and around. Beautiful Sonll whose leaves I
have read with reverence, it was for thy sake, thine alone,
that I would have given thee to one who might make thee
happier on earth than Ican. 1 Viola! Viola l thou know-
est not—never canst thou know— how dear thou art to
me l ”
It is in vain to seek for words to describe the delight—
the proud, the full, the complete, and the entire delight
that ﬁlled the heart of the Neapolitan. He whom she
had considered too lofty even for love—more humble to
her than those she had half-despised! She was silent,
but her eyes spoke to him ; and then slowly, as aware, at
last, that the human love had advanced on the ideal, she
shrunk into the terrors of a modest and virtuous nature.
She did not dare-she did not dream to ask him the
question she had so fearlessly made to Glyndon ; but she
felt a sudden coldness—a sense that a barrier was yet
between love and love. “Oh, Zanoni l” she murmured,

with downcast eyes, “ ask me not to ﬂy with thee; tempt
me not to my shame. Thou wouldst protect me from
others. Oh, protect me from thyself!”
“Poor orphan i” said he tenderly, “and canst thou
think that I ask from thee one sacriﬁce,—-still less the
greatest that woman can give to love? As my wife I
woo thee, and by every tie, and by every vow that can
hallow and endear aﬂ'ectio'n. Alas! they have belied
love to thee indeed, if thou dost not know the religion
that belongs to itl They who truly love would seek, for
the treasure they obtain, every bond that can make it
lasting and secure. Viola, weep not, unless thou givest
me the holy right to kiss away thy tears l”
And that beautiful face, no more averted, drooped upon
his bosom; and as he bent dewn, his lips sought the rosy
mouth: a long and burning kiss—danger—life-the
world was forgotten I Suddenly Zanoni tore himself from
her. I

As that wind, my power to preserve thee, to guard thee,
to foresee the storm in thy skies, is gone. No matter.
Haste, haste; and may love supply the loss of all that it
has dared to sacriﬁce! Come.” '
Viola'hesitated no more. She threw the mantle over
her shoulders, and gathered up her dishevelled hair; a
moment, and she was prepared, when a sudden crash was
heard below.
“ Too late l—fool that I was—too late I ” cried Zanoni,
in a sharp tone of agony, as he hurried to the door. He

opened it, only to be borne back by the press of armed
men. The room literally swarmed with the followers of
the ravisher, masked, and armed to the teeth.
Viola was already in the grasp of two of the myrmidons.
Her shriek smote the ear of Zanoni. He sprang forward:
and Viola heard his wild cry in a foreign tongue. She
saw the blades of the ruﬁians pointed at his breast! She
lost her senses ; and when she recovered,'she found herself '
gagged, and in a carriage that was driven rapidly, by the
side of a masked and motionless ﬁgure. The carriage
stopped at the portals of a gloomy mansion. The gates
opened noiselessly; a broad ﬂight of steps, brilliantly
illumined, was before her. She was in the palace of the
Prince di-—-.

THE young actress was led to, and left alone in, a

taste that, at one time, characterized the palaces of the
great seigneurs of Italy. Her ﬁrst thought was for

of her life—~her lord, at last her lover?
She had short thne for reﬂecﬁon. She heard steps
approaching the chamber; she drew back, but trembled
not. A courage, not of herself, never known before,
sparkled in her eyes, and dilated her stature. Living or
dead, she would be faithful still to Zanoni! There was
' a new motive to the preservation of honor. The door
opened, and the Prince entered in the gorgeous and gaudy
costume still worn at that time in Naples.
“Fair and cruel one,” said he, advancing, with a half-
sneer upon his lip, “thou wilt not too harshly blame the
violence of love.” He attempted to take her hand as he
spoke
“Ilayﬂ’said he,as she recoﬂed,“reﬂectthatthou art
now in the power of one that never faltered in the pursuit
of an object less dear to him than thou art. Thy lover,
presumptuous though he be, is not by to save thee. Mine
thou art; but instead of thy master, suffer me to be thy
slave.”
“ Prince,” said Viola, with a stern gravity, “your boast
is in vain. Your power] I am not in your power. Life
and death are in my own hands. I will not defy, but I
do not fear you. I feel --and in some feelings,” added
Viola, with a solemnity almost thrilling, “there is all the
strength, and all the divinity of knowledge—I feel that
I am safe even here; but you—you, Prince di

however, a man easily intimidated or deterred from. any
purpose be had formed; and, approaching Viola, he was
about to reply with much warmth, real or affected, when
a knock was heard at the door of the chamber. The sound
was repeated, and the Prince, chafed at the interruption,
opened the door and demanded, impatiently, who had
ventured to disobey his orders, and invade his leisure.
Mascari presented himself, pale and agitated : “ My lord,”
said he, in a whisper, “pardon me; but a stranger is
below, who insists on seeing you ; and, from some words
he let fall, Ijudged it advisable even to infringe your
commands.”
“A stranger l—— and at this hour I What business can
he pretend ? Why was he even admitted 1”
“He asserts that your life is in imminent danger. The
source whence it proceeds he will relate to your Excellency
alone.”
The Prince frowned ; but his color changed. He mused
a moment, and then re-entering the chamber, and advanc-
ing towards Viola, he said—
“Believe me, fair creature, I have no wish to take
advantage of my power. I would fain trust alone to the
gentler authorities of affection. Hold yourself queen
within these walls more absolutely than you have ever
enacted that part on the stage. To-night, farewell l
May your sleep be calm, and yodrdreams propitious to

With these words he retired, and in a few moments

Viola was surrounded by o_ﬂicious attendants, whom she
at length, with some diﬂiculty, dismissed; and refusing
to retire to rest, she spent the night in examining the
chamber, which she found was secured, and in thoughts
of Zanoni, in whose power she felt an almost preteruatural
conﬁdence. ,
Meanwhile, the Prince descended the stairs, and sought
the room into which the stranger had been shown.
He found the visitor wrapped from head to foot in a
long robe —half-gown half-mantle—such as was some-
times worn by ecclesiastics. The face of this stranger
was remarkable. Soisunburnt and swarthy were his hues,
that he must, apparently, have derived his origin amongst
the races of the furthest East. His forehead was lofty,
and his eyes so penetrating, yet so calm in their gaze,
that the Prince shrunk from them as we shrink from a
questioner who is drawing forth the guiltiest secret of
our hearts.
“ What would you with me I? ” asked the Prince, motion-
ing his visitor to a seat.
“Prince of—," said the stranger, in a voice deep
and sweet, but foreign in its accent; “son of the most
energetic and masculine race that ever applied god-like
genius to the service of Human Will, with its winding
wickedness and its stubborn grandeur; descendant of the
great Visconti, in whose chronicles lies the History of
Italy in her palmy day, and in whose rise was the develop-
ment of the mightiest intellect, ripened by the most restless

“What means this jargon ? ” said the Prince, in visible
astonishment and secret awe. “ Comest thou to menace
me in my own halls, or wouldst thou warn me ofa danger?
Art thou some itinerant mountebank, or some unguessed~
of friend ? Speak out, and plainly. -What danger threatens
me 7 ”
“ Zanoni and thy ancestor’s sword,”replied the stranger.
‘7 Ha. 1 ha i "said the Prince laughing scornfully, “ I half
suspected thee from the ﬁrst. Thou art then the accom~
plice or the tool of that most dexterous, but, at present,
defeated charlatan? And I suppose thou wilt tell me
that, if I were to release a certain captive I have made,
the danger would vanish, and the hand of the dial would
be put back?”
“ Judge of me as thou wilt, Prince di I confess,
my knowledge of Zanoni. Thou, too, wilt know his
power, but not till it consume thee. I would save, there-
fore I warn thee. Dost thou ask me why? I will tell
thee. Canst thou remember to have heard wild tales of
thy grandsire ?—of his desire for a knowledge that passes
that of the schools and cloisters ?-of a strange man from

the east, whd was his familiar and master in lore, against
which the Vatican has, from age to age, launched its
mimic thunder? Dost thou call to mind the fortunes of
thy ancestor?—how he succeeded in youth to little but
a name ?——how, after a career wild and dissolute as thine,

he disappeared from Milan, a pauper, and a self-exile ?—
how after years spent, none knew in what climes or in
what pursuits, he again revisited the city where his pro-
genitors had reigned ?—how with him came the wise man
of the East, the mystic Mejnour ?--how they who beheld
him, beheld with amaze and fear that time had ploughed
no furrow on his brow; that youth seemed ﬁxed, as by a
spell, upon his face and form ? Dost thou not know that
from that hour his fortunes rose? Kinsmen the most
remote died; estate upon estate fell into the hands of
the ruined noble. He became the guide of princes, the
ﬁrst magnate of Italy. He founded anew the house of
which thou art the last lineal upholder, and transferred
his splendor from Milan to the Sicilian realms. Visions
of high ambition were then present with him nightly and
daily. Had he lived, Italy would have known a new
dynasty, and the Visconti would have reigned over Magna-
Graacia. He was a man such as the world rarely sees;
but his ends, too earthly, were at war with the means he
sought. Had his ambition been more or less, he had
been worthy of a realm mightier than the Caesars swayed;
worthy of our solemn order; worthy of the fellowship of
Mejnour, whom you now behold before you.”
The Prince, who had listened with deep and breathless
attention to the words of his singular guest,'started from
his seat at his last words. “ Impostor l ” he cried, “can
you dare thus to play with my credulity? Sixty years
have ﬂown since my grandsire died; were he living, he
lhad passed his hundred and twentieth year; and you,

whose old age is erect and vigorous, have the assurance
to pretend to have been his contemporary! But you have
imperfectly learned your tale. You know not, it seems,
that my grandsire, wise and illustrious indeed, in all save
his faith in a charlatan, was found dead in his bed, in the
very hour when his colossal plans were'ripe for execution,
and that Mejnour was guilty of his murder.”
“Alas!” answered the stranger, in a voice of great
sadness, “had be but listened to Mejuour, had he but
delayed the last and most perilous ordeal of daring wisdom
until the requisite training and initiation had been com-
pleted, your ancestor would have stood with me upon an
eminence which the waters of Death itself wash everlast-
ingly, but cannot overﬂow. Your grandsire resisted my
fervent prayers, disobeyed my most absolute commands,
and in the sublime rashness of a soul that panted for
secrets. which he who desires orbs and sceptres never can
obtain, perished, the victim of his own frenzy.”
“He was poisoned, and Mejnour ﬂed.”
“Mejnour ﬂed not,” answered the stranger, proudly;
“ Mejnour could not ﬂy from danger; for, to him, danger
is a thing long left behind. It was the day before the
duke took the fatal draught which he believed was to
confer on the mortal the immortal boon, that ﬁnding my
power over him was gone, I abandoned him to his doom.
But a truce with this: I loved your grandsirel I would
save the last of his race. Oppose not thyself to Zanoni.
Yield not thy soul to thine evil passions. Draw bacl;
from the precipice while there is yet time. In thy front,

and in thine eyes, I detect some of that diviner glory
which belonged to thy race. Thou hast in thee some
germs of their hereditary genius, but they are choked up
by worse than thy hereditary vices. _ Recollect that by
genius thy house rose ; by vice it ever failed to perpetuate
its power. In the laws which regulate the Universe, it
is decreed that nothing wicked can long endure. Be wise,
and let history warn thee. Thou standest on the verge
of two worlds, the Past and the Future; and voices from
either shriek omen in thy ear. I have done. I bid thee
farewell ! ”
“Not so ; thou shalt not quit these walls. I will make
experiment of thy boasted power. What, ho there i—
ho i”
The Prince shouted; the room was ﬁlled with his
minions. I
“ Seize that man I ” he cried, pointing to the spot which
had been ﬁlled by .the form of Mejnour. To his incon-
ceivable amaze and horror, thevspot was vacant. The
mysterious stranger had vanished like a dream. But a
thin and fragrant mist undulated, in pale volumes, round
the walls of the chamber. “Look to my lord,” cried
Mascari. The Prince had fallen to the ﬂoor insensible.
For many hours he seemed in a kind of trance. When
he recovered, he dismissed his attendants, and his step
was heard in his chamber, pacing to and fro, with heavy
and disordered strides. Not till an hour before his ban-
quet the next day did he seem restored to his wouted self

CHAPTER XV.
Oime! come poss’ i0
Altri trovar, se me trovar non posso.*
Amman, At. i. Sc. ii.
THE sleep of Glyndon, the night after his last interview
with Zanoni, was unusually profound; and the sun streamed
full upon his eyes, as he opened them to the day. He
rose refreshed, and with a. strange sentiment of calmness,
that seemed more the result of resolution than exhaustion.
The incidents and emotions of the past night had settled
into distinct and clear impressions. He thought of them
but slightly-he thought rather of the future. He was
as one of the initiated in the old Egyptian mysteries, who
have crossed the gate only to long more ardently for the
penetralia.
He dressed himself, and was relieved to ﬁnd that Mervale
had joined a party of his countrymen on an excursion to
Ischia. He spent the heat of noon in thoughtful solitude,
and gradually the image of Viola returned to his heart.
He had
resigned her; and though he repented not, he was troubled
at the thought that repentance would have come too late.
It was a holy—for it was a human—image.
He started impatiently from his seat, and strode with
rapid steps to the humble abode of the actress.

The distance was considerable, and the air oppressive.
Glyndon arrived at the door breathless and heated. He
knocked ; no answer came. He lifted the latch and
entered. He ascended the stairs: no sound, no sight of
life met his ear and eye. In the front chamber, on a table,
lay the guitar of the actress and some manuscript parts in
the favorite operas. He paused, and summoning courage,
tapped at the door which seemed to lead into the inner
apartment. The door was ajar; and, hearing no sound
within, he pushed it open. It was the sleeping chamber
of the young actress, that holiest ground to a lover; and
well did the place become the presiding deity; none of
the tawdry ﬁnery of the profession was visible, on the
one hand ; none of the slovenly disorder common to the
humbler classes of the south, on the other. All was pure
and simple : even the ornaments were those of an innocent
reﬁnement ; a few books, placed carefully on shelves, a few
half-faded ﬂowers in an earthen vase, which was modelled
and painted in the Etruscan fashion. The sunlight stream-
ed over the snowy draperies of the bed, and a few articles
of clothing on the chair beside it. Viola was not there ;
but the nurse l—was she gone also ? He made the house
resound with the name of Gionetta, but there was not
even an echo to reply. At last, as he reluctantly quitted
the desolate abode, he perceived Gionetta coming towards
him from the street. The poor old woman uttered an
exclamation of joy on seeing him; but to their mutual
disappointment, neither had any cheerful tidings or satis-
factory explanation to aﬁ'ord the other. Gionetta had

been aroused from her slumber the night before by the
noise in the rooms below; but, ere she could muster
courage to descend, Viola was gone! She found the
marks of violence on the door without; and all she had
been able to learn in the neighborhood, was, that a Laz-
zarone, from his nocturnal resting-place on the Chiaja, had
seen by the moon-light a carriage, which he recognized
as belonging to the Prince di

, pass and repass that
road about the ﬁrst hour of morning. Glyndon, on
gathering, from the confused words and broken sobs of
the old nurse, the heads of this account, abruptly left her,
and repaired to the palace of Zanoni. There he was
informed that the Signor was gone to the banquet of the
Prince di

, and would not return till late. Glyndon
stood motionless with perplexity and dismay; he knew
not what to believe, or how to act. Even Mervale was
not at hand to advise him. His conscience smote him
bitterly. He had had the power to save the woman he
had loved, and had foregone that power; but how was it
that in this Zanoni himself had failed ? How was it that
he was gone to the very banquet of the ravisher? Could
Zanoni be aware of what had passed? If not, should he
lose a moment in apprising him? Though mentally
irresolute, no man was more physically brave. He would
repair at once to the palace of the Prince himself; and
if Zanoni failed in the trust he had half appeared to
arrogate, he, the humble foreigner, would demand the
captive of fraud and force, in the very halls and before
the assembled guests of the Prince di .

WE must go back some hours in the progress of this
narrative. It was the ﬁrst faint and gradual break of
the summer dawn; and two men stood in a balcony
overhanging a garden fragrant with the scents of the
awakening ﬂowers. The stars had not yet left the sky
—the birds were yet silent on the boughs; all was still,
hushed, and tranquil; but how different the tranquillity
of reviving day from the solemn repose of night! In the
music of silence there are a thousand variations. These
men, who alone seemed awake in Naples, were Zanoni
and the mysterious stranger, who had but an hour or
two ago startled the Prince di
palace.
“ No,” said the latter; “ hadst thou delayed the accept-
ance of the Arch-Gift until thou hadst attained to the

have survived the very desire and dream of the love of
woman. Brightest, and, but for that error, perhaps the
loftiest, of the secret and solemn race that ﬁlls up the
interval in creation between mankind and the children of
the Empyreal, age after age wilt thou rue the splendid
folly which made thee ask to carry the beauty and the
passions of youth into the dreary grandeur of earthly
immortality.”
“I do not repent, nor shall I,” answered Zanoni. “The ‘
transport and the sorrow, so wildly blended, which have
at intervals diversiﬁed my doom, are better than the calm
and bloodless tenor of thy solitary way. Thou, who lovest
nothing, hatest nothing, feelest nothing, and walkest the
world with the noiseless and Jrdyless footsteps of adream l ”
“ You mistake,” replied he who had owned the name of
Mejnour,——“though I care not for love, and am dead to
every passion that agitates the sons of clay, I am not
dead to their more serene enjoyments. I carry down the
stream ofthe countless years, not the turbulent desires of
youth, but the calm and spiritual delights of age. Wisely
and deliberately I abandoned youth for ever when I sepa~
rated my lot from men. Let us not envy or reproach
each other. I would have saved this Neapolitan, Zanoni
(since so it now pleases thee to be called),--partly because
his grandsire was but divided by the last airy barrier from
our own brotherhood—partly because I know that in
the man himself lurk the elements of ancestral courage
and power, which in earlier life would have ﬁtted him for
one of us. Earth holds but few to whom nature has given

the qualities that can bear the ordeal! But time and
excess, that have thickened his grosser senses, have blunted
his imagination. I relinquish him to his doom.”
“And still, then, Mejnour, you cherish the desire to
revive our order, limited now to ourselves alone, by new
converts and allies. Surely~ surely—thy experience
might have taught thee, that scarcely once in a thousand
years is born the being who can pass through the horrible
gates that lead into the worlds without! Is not thy path
already strewed with thy victims? Do not their ghastly
faces of agony and fear—the blood-stained suicide, the
raving maniac—rise before thee, and warn what is yet
left to thee of human sympathy from thy insane ambition ? ”
“ Nay,” answered Mejnour; “ have I not had success
to counterbalance failure? And can I forego this lofty
and august hope, worthy alone of our high condition—
the hope to form a mighty and numerous race with a
force and power sufﬁcient to permit them to acknowledge
to mankind their majestic conquests and dominion - to
become the true lords of this planet—invaders, perchance
of others,—masters of the inimical and malignant tribes
by which at this moment we are surrounded—a race
that may proceed, in their deathless destinies, from stage
to stage of celestial glory, and rank at last amongst the
nearest ministrants and agents gathered round the Throne
of Thrones? What matter a thousand victims for one

Mejnour, after a pause—“you, even you, should this
affection for a mortal beauty that you have dared, despite

yourself, to cherish, be more than a passing fancy—should
it, once admitted into your inmost nature, partake of its
bright and enduring essence—even you may brave all
things to raise the beloved one into your equal. Nay,
interrupt me not. Can you see sickness menace her-
danger hover around —years creep on - the eyes grow
dim —the beauty fade—while the heart, youthful still,
clings and fastens round your own,_-can you see this,
and know it is yours to.———”
“ Cease i ” cried zanoni, ﬁercely. “What is all other
fate as compared to the death of terror? What, when
the coldest sage—the most heated enthusiast—the hardiest
warrior, with his nerves of iron -—have been found dead
in their beds, with straining eyeballs and horrent hair, at
the ﬁrst step of the Dread Progress,—— thinkest thou that

Snumvoows, New Light of Alchemy.
THE Prince di —~_-- was not a man whom Naples could
suppose to be addicted to superstitious fancies. Still, in
the south of Italy, there was then, and there still lingers,
a certain spirit of credulity, which may, ever and anon, be
visible amidst the boldest dogmas of their philosophers
and skeptics. \ In his childhood, the Prince had learned
strange tales of the ambition, the genius, and the career
of his grandsire,—- and secretly, perhaps inﬂuenced by
ancestral example, in earlier youth he himself had followed
science, not only through her legitimate course, but her
antiquated and erratic windings. I have, indeed, been
shown in Naples a little volume, blazoned with the arms
of the Viseonti, and ascribed to the nobleman I refer to,
which treats of alchemy in a spirit half mocking and half
reverential.
Pleasure soon distracted him from such speculations, and

his talents, which were unquestionably great, were wholly
perverted to extravagant intrigues, or to the embellish-
ment of a gorgeous ostentation with something of a classic
grace. His immense wealth, his imperious pride, his
unscrupulous and daring character, made him an object
of no inconsiderable fear to a feeble and timid court; and
the ministers of the indolent government willingly connived
at excesses which allured him at least from ambition. The
strange visit, and yet more strange departure, of Mejnour,
ﬁlled the breast of the Neapolitan with awe and wonder,
against which all the haughty arrogance and learned
skepticism of his maturer manhood combated in vain.
The apparition of Mejnour served, indeed, to invest Za-
noni with a character in which the Prince had not hitherto
regarded him. He felt a strange alarm at the rival he
had braved—at the foe he had provoked. When, a little
before his banquet, he had resumed his self-possession, it
was with a fell and gloomy resolution that he broodcd
over the perﬁdious schemes he had previously formed.
He felt as if the death of the mysterious Zanoni were
necessary for the preservation of his own life; and if at
an earlier period of their rivalry he had determined on
the fate of Zanoni, the warnings of Mejnour only served
to conﬁrm his resolve.
“We will try if his magic can invent an antidote to
the bane,” said he, half aloud, and with a stern smile, as
he summoned Mascari to his presence. The poison which
the Prince, with his own hands, mixed into the wine
intended for his guest, was compounded from materials,

the secret of which had been one of the proudest heir-
looms of that able and evil race, which gave to Italy her
wisest and guiltiest tyrants. Its operation was quick, yet
not sudden—it produced no pain—it left on the form no .
grim convulsion, on the skin no purpling spot, to arouse
suspicion,——-y0u might have cut and carved every mem-
brane and ﬁbre of the corpse, but the sharpest eyes of tlie
leech would not have detected the presence of the subtle
life-queller. For twelve hours the victim felt nothing,
save a joyous and elated exhilaration of the blood; a
delicious languor followed, the sure forerunner of apo-
plexy. N0 lancet then could save! Apoplexy had run
much in the families of the enemies of the Visconti !
The hour of the feast arrived —the guests assembled.
There were the ﬂower of the Neapolitan seignom'e, the
descendants of the Norman, the Teuton, the Goth; for
Naples had then a nobility, but derived it from the North,
which has indeed been the Nutrix Leonum, the nurse of
the lion-hearted chivalry of the world.
Last of the guests came Zanoni; and the crowd gave
way as the dazzling foreigner moved along to the lord of
the palace. The Prince greeted him with a meaning
smile, to which Zanoni answered by a whisper—“He
who plays with loaded dice does not always win.”
The Prince hit his lip, and Zanoni, passing on, seemed
deep in conversation with the fawning Mascari.
“ Who is the Prince’s heir?” asked the guest.
“A distant relation on the mother’s side; with his
Excellency dies the male line.”

“Is the heir present at our host’s banquet?”
“No: they are not friends.” v
“No matter: he will be here to-morrow!”
Mascari stared in surprise; but the signal for the
banquet was given, and the guests were marshalled to
the board. As was the custom then, the feast took place
not long after mid-day. It was a long oval hall, the
whole of one side opening by a marble colonnade upon
a eourt or garden, in which the eye rested gratefully upon
cool fountains and statues of whitest marble, half-sheltered
by orange-trees. Every art that luxury could invent to
give freshness and coolness to the languid and breezeless
heat of the day without (a day on which the breath of
the sirocco was abroad) had been called into existence.
Artiﬁcial currents of air through invisible tubes, silken
blinds waving to and fro, as if to cheat the senses into
the belief of an April wind, and miniature jets d’eau in
each corner of the apartment, gave to the Italians the
same sense of exhilaration and comfort (if I may use the
word) which the well-drawn curtains and the blazing
hearth afford to the children of colder climes.
The conversation was somewhat more lively and intel-
lectual than is common amongst the languid pleasure.
hunters of the South; for the Prince, himself accomplished,
sought his acquaintance not only amongst the beam:
esprits of his own country, but amongst the gay foreigners
who adorned and relieved the monotony of the Neapolitan
circles. There were present two or three of the brilliant
Frenchmen of the old réqe'me, who had already emigrated

from the advancing revolution; and their peculiar turn
of thought and wit was well calculated for the meridian
of a society that made the Dolce far m'ente at once its
philosophy and its faith. The Prince, however, was more
silent than usual; and when he sought to rouse himself,
his spirits were forced and exaggerated. To the manners
of his host, those of Zanoni afforded a striking contrast.
The bearing of this singular person was at all times char-
acterized by a calm and polished case, which was attributed
by the courtiers to the long habit of society. He could
scarcely be called gay: yet few persons more tended to
animate the general spirits of a convivial circle. He
seemed, by a kind of intuition, to elicit from each com-
panion the qualities in which he most excelled; and if
occasionally a certain tone of latent mockery characterized
his remarks upon the topics on which the conversation
fell, it appeared to men who took nothing in earnest to be
the language both of wit and wisdom. To the Frenchmen,
in particular, there was something startling in his intimate
knowledge of the minutest events in their own capital
and country, and his profound penetration, (evinced but
in epigrams and sarcasms) into the eminent characters
who were than playing a part upon the great stage of
Continental intrigue. It was while this conversation grew
animated, and the feast was at its height, that Glyndon
arrived at the palace. The porter, perceiving by his dress
that he was not one of the invited guests, told him that
his Excellency was engaged, and on no account could be
disturbed; and Glyndon then, for the ﬁrst time, became

aware how strange and embarrassing was the duty he had
.taken on himself. To force an entrance into the banquet-
hall of a great and powerful noble, surrounded by the
rank of Naples, and to arraign him for what to his boon
companions would appear but an act of gallantry, was
an exploit that could not fail to be at once ludicrous and
impotent. He mused a moment; and slipping a piece of
gold into the porter’s hand, said that he was commissioned
to seek the Signor Zanoni upon an errand of life and
death ; and easily won his way across the court, and into
the interior building. He passed up the broad staircase,
and the voices and merriment of the revellers smote his
ear at a distance. At the entrance of the reception-rooms
he found a page, whom be despatched with a message to
Zanoni. The page did the errand; and Zanoni, on hearing
the whispered name of Glyndon, turned to his host.
“Pardon me, my lord; an English friend of mine, the
Signor Glyndon (not unknown by name to your Excellency)
waits without—the business must indeed be urgent on
which he has sought me in such an hour. You will for-
give my momentary absence.”
“Nay, Signor,” answered the Prince, courteously, but
with a sinister smile on his countenance, “would it not
be better for your friend to join us? An Englishman is
welcome everywhere ; and even were he a Dutchman, your
friendship would invest his presence with attraction. Pray
his attendance,— we would not spare you even for a
moment.”
Zanoni bowed—the page was despatched with all

ﬂattering messages to Glyndon—a seat next to Zanoni
was placed for him, and the young Englishman entered,
“ You are most welcome, sir. I trust your business to
our illustrious guest is ofgood- omen and pleasant import.
If you bring evil news, defer it, I pray you.”
Glyndon’s brow was sullen ; and he was about to startle
the guests by his reply, when Zanoni, touching his arm
signiﬁcantly, whispered in English -“I know whygyou
have sought me. Be silent, and witness what ensues.”
“ You know then that Viola, whom you boasted you
had the power to save from danger ”
“In this house l-yes. I know also that Murder sits at
the right hand of our host. But his fate is now separated
from hers for ever; and the mirror which glasses it to my
eye is clear through the streams of blood. Be still, and
learn the fate that awaits the wicked l”
“My lord,” said Zanoni, speaking aloud, “the Signor

motive to make the most of the present hour.”
“And what, if I may venture to ask, may be the cause
that brings such aﬁliction on the fair dames of Naples ?”
“ It is the approaching death of one who honored me
with most loyal friendship,” replied Zanoni, gravely,
“Let us not speak of it; grief cannot put back the dial.
As we supply by new ﬂowers those that fade in our vases,
so it is the secret of worldly wisdom to replace by fresh
friendships those that fade from our path."
I“ True philosophy I” exclaimed the Prince. “ ‘ Not to

admire,’ was the Roman’s maxim ; ‘ Never to mourn,’ is
mine. There is nothing in life to grieve for, save, indeed,
Signor Zanoni, when some young beauty on whom we have
set our hearts, slips from our grasp. In such a moment
we have need of all our wisdom, not to succumb to des -
pair, and shake hands with death. What say you, Signor ?
You smile 1 Such never could be your lot. Pledge me
in a sentiment—‘ Long life to the fortunate lover—a
quick release to the bafﬂed suitor l ”’
"I pledge you,” said Zanoni; and as the fatal wine
was poured into his glass, he repeated, ﬁxing his eyes on
the Prince, “I pledge you even in this wine!”
He lifted the glass to his lips. The Prince seemed
ghastly pale, while the gaze of his guest bent 'upon him,
with an intent and stern brightness, beneath which the
conscience-stricken host cowered and quailed. Not till
he had drained the draught, and replaced the glass upon
the board, did Zanoni turn his eyes from the Prince; and
he then said, “Your wine has been kept too long; it has
lost its virtues. It might disagree with many, but do not
fear; it will not harm me, Prince. Signor Mascari, you
are a judge of the grape; will you favor us with your
opinion ?”
“Nay,” answered Mascari, with well-aﬂ’ected com-
posure, “ I like not the wines of Cyprus; they are beating.
Perhaps Signor Glyndon may not have the same distaste ?'
The English are said to love their potations warm and
pungent "
“ Do you wish my friend also to taste the wine, Prince ?”

said Zanoni. “Recollect, all cannot drink it with the
same impunity as myself.” ‘
“No,” said the Prince, hastily; “if you do not recom-
mend the wine, Heaven forbid that we should constrain
our guestsl My Lord Duke,” turning to one of the
Frenchmen, “yours is the true soil of Bacchus. What
think you of this cask from Burgundy? Has it borne
the journey?”
“Ah,” said Zanoni, “let us change both the wine and
the theme.”
With that, Zanoni grew yet more animated and brilliant.
Never did wit more sparkling, airy, exhilarating, ﬂash
from the lips of reveller. His spirits fascinated all present
—even the Prince himself, even Glyndon—with a strange
and wild contagion. The former, indeed, whom the words
and gaze of Zanoni, when be drained the poison, had
ﬁlled with fearful misgivings, now hailed in the brilliant
eloquence of his wit, a certain sign of the operation of
the bane. The wine circulated fast; but none seemed
conscious of its effects. One by one the rest of the party
fell into a charmed and spell-bound silence, as Zanoni
continued to pour forth sally upon sally, tale upon tale.
They hung on his words, they almost held their breath
to listen. Yet, how bitter was his mirth l—how full of
contempt for the triﬁers present, and for the triﬁes which
made their life! ’
Night came on ; the room grew dim, and the feast had
lasted several hours longer than was the customary dura-
tion of similar entertainments at that day. Still the guests

stirred not, and still Zanoni continued, with glittering
eye and mocking lip, to lavish his stores of intellect and
anecdote; when suddenly the moon rose, and shed its
rays over the ﬂowers and fountains in the court without,
leaving the room itself half in shadow and half tinged by
a quiet and ghostly light.
It was then that Zanoni rose. “Well, gentlemen,"
said he, “ we have not yet wearied our host, I hope; and
his garden offers a new temptation to protract our stay.
Have you no musicians among your train, Prince, that
might regale our ears while we inhale the fragrance of
your orange-trees ?”
“An excellent thought i” said the Prince. “ Mascari,
see to the music.”
The party rose simultaneously to adjourn to the garden ;
and then, for the ﬁrst time, the effect of the wine they had
drunk seemed to make itself felt.
With ﬂushed cheeks and unsteady steps they came into
the open air, which tended yet more to stimulate that
glowing fever of the grape. As if to make up for the
silence with which the guests had hitherto listened to
Zanoni, every tongue was now loosened—every man
talked, no man listened. There was something wild and
fearful in the contrast between the calm beauty of the
night and scene, and the hubbub and clamor of these
disorderly roysters. One of the Frenchmen, in especial,
the young Due de R

, a nobleman of the highest
rank, and of all the quick, vivacious, and irascible tem-
perament of his countrymen, was particularly noisy and

excited. And as circumstances, the remembrance of which
is still preserved among certain circles of Naples, rendered
it afterwards necessary that the Due should himself give
' evidence of what occurred, I will here translate the short
account he drew up, and which was kindly submitted to
me some few years ago by my accomplished and lively
friend, 11 Gavaliere di B——.
“I never remember,” writes the Due, “to have felt my
spirits so excited as on that evening; we were like so
many boys released from school, jostling each other as we
reeled or ran down the ﬂight of seven or eight stairs that
led from the colonnade into the garden,— some laughing,
some whooping, some scolding, some babbling. The wine
had brought out, as it were, each man’s inmost character.
Some were loud and quarrelsome, others sentimental and
whining; some whom we had hitherto thought dull, most
mirthful; some whom we had ever regarded as discreet
and taciturn, most garrulous and uproarious. I remember
that in the midst of our clamorous gaiety, my eye fell
upon the cavalier Signor Zanoni, whose conversation had
so enchanted us all; and I felt a certain chill come over
me to perceive that he wore the same calm and unsympa-
thizing smile upon his countenance which had characterized
it in his singular and curious stories of the court of Louis
XIV. I felt, indeed, half-inclined to seek a quarrel with
one whose composure was almost an insult to our disorder.
Nor was such an effect of this irritating and mocking
tranquillity conﬁned to myself alone. Several of the party

have told me since, that, on looking at Zanoni, they felt
their blood yet more heated, and gaiety change to resent-
ment. There seemed in his icy smile a very charm to
wound vanity and provoke rage. It was at this moment
that the Prince came up to me, and, passing his arm into
mine, led me a little apart from the rest. He had certainly
indulged in the same excess as ourselves, but it did not
produce the same eﬁ'ect of noisy excitement. There was,
on the contrary, a certain cold arrogance and supercilions
scorn in his bearing and language, which, even while aﬂ‘ect-
ing so much caressing courtesy towards me, roused my
self-love against him. He seemed as if Zanoni had
infected him; and in imitating the manner of his guest,
he surpassed the original. He rallied me on some cohrt
gossip, which had honored my name by associating it with
a certain beautiful and distinguished Sicilian lady, and
aﬁ'ected to treat with contempt that which, had it been
true, I should have regarded as a boast. He spoke,
indeed, as if he himself had gathered all the ﬂowers of
Naples, and left us foreigners only the gleanings he had
scorned. At this, my natural and national gallantry was
piqued, and I retorted by some sarcasms that I should
certainly have spared had my blood been cooler. He
laughed heartily, and left me in a strange ﬁt of resentment.
and anger. Perhaps (I must own the truth) the wine
had produced in me a wild disposition to take offence
and provoke quarrel. As the Prince left me, I turned,
and saw Zanoni at my side.
“‘The Prince is a braggart,’ said he, with the same

smile that displeased me before. ‘ He would monopolize
all fortune and all love. Let us take our revenge.”’
“ ‘And how ?’
“ ‘He has, at this moment, in his house the most en-
chanting singer in Naples—the celebrated Viola. Pisani.
She is here, it is true, not by her own choice ; he carried
her hither by force, but he will pretend that she adores
him. Let us insist on his producing his secret treasure,
and when she enters, the Due de R

would be a fair revenge upon his imperious self-conceit.’
“This suggestion delighted me. I hastened to the
Prince. At that moment the musicians had just com-
menced; I waved my hand, ordered the music to stop,
and addressing the Prince, who was standing in the centre
of one of the gayest groups, complained of his want of
hospitality in alfording to us such poor proﬁcieuts in the
art, while be reserved for his own solace the lute and
voice of the ﬁrst performer in Naples. I demanded half-
laughingly, half-seriously, that he should produce the
Pisani. My demand was received with shouts of applause
by the rest. We drowned the replies of our host with
uproar, and would hear no denial. ‘Gentlemen,’ at last
said the Prince, when he could obtain an audience, ‘ even
were I to assent to your proposal, I could not induce the
Signora to present herself before an assemblage as riotous
as they are noble. You have too much chivalry to use
compulsion with her, though the Due de R

“I was stung by this taunt, however well deserved
‘ Prince,’ said I, ‘I have for the indelicacy of compulsion
so illustrious an example, that I cannot hesitate to pursue
the path honored by your own footsteps. All Naples
knows that the Pisani despises at once your gold and your
love-—that force alone could have brought her under your
roof; and that you refuse to produce her, because you
fear her complaints, and know enough of the chivalry
your vanity sneers at to feel assured that the gentlemen
of France are not more disposed to worship beauty than
to defend it from wrong.’ I
“ ‘You speak well, sir,’ said Zanoni, gravely. ‘The
Prince dares not produce his prizel’
“ The Prince remained speechless for a few moments,
as it with indignation. At last he broke out into expres-
sions the most injurious and insulting against Signor
Zanoni and myself. Zanoni replied not; I was more
hot and hasty. The guests appeared to delight in ourv
dispute. None, except ~Mascari, whom we pushed aside
and disdained to hear, strove to conciliate; some took
one side, some another. The issue may be well foreseen.
Swords were called for and procured. Two were oﬂ'ered
me by one of the party. I was about to choose one, when
Zanoni placed in my hand the other, which, from its hilt,
appeared of antiquated workmanship. At the same
moment, looking towards the Prince, he said, smilingly,
‘The Duc takes your grandsire’s sword. Prince, you are
too brave a man for superstition; you have forgot the
forfeit 1’ Our host seemed to me to recoil and turn pale

at those words ; nevertheless, he returned Zanoni’s smile
with a look of deﬁance. The next moment all was broil
and disorder. There might be some six or eight persons
engaged in a strange and confused kind of mélée, but the
Prince and myself only sought each other. The noise
around us, the confusion of the guests, the cries of the
musicians, the clash of our own swords, only served to
stimulate our unhappy fury. Wé feared to be interrupted
by the attendants, and fought like madmen, without skill
or method. I thrust and parried mechanically, blind and
frantic, as if a demon had entered into me, till I saw the
Prince stretched at my feet, bathed in his blood, and
Zanoni bending over him, and whispering in his ear.
That sight cooled us all. The strife ceased, we gathered
in shame, remorse, and horror, round our ill-fated host—-
but it was too late—his eyes rolled fearfully in his head.
I have seen many men die, but never one who were such
horror on his countenance. At last, all was over i Zanoni
rose from the corpse, and, taking, with great composure,
the sword from my hand, said, calmly—‘ Ye are witnesses,
gentlemen, that the Prince brought his fate upon himself.
The last of that illustrious house has perished in a brawl.’
“I saw no more of Zanoni. I hastened to our envoy
to narrate the event, and abide the issue. I am grateful
to the Neapolitan government, and t0 the illustrious heir
of the unfortunate nobleman, for the lenient and generous,
yetjust, interpretation put upon a misfortune, the memory
of which will afflict me to the last hour of my life.

In the above memorial, the reader will ﬁnd the most
exact and minute account yet given of an event which
created the most lively sensation at Naples in that day.
Glyndon had taken no part in the aﬁ'ray, neither had
he participated largely in the excesses of the revel. For
his exemption from both, he was perhaps indebted to the
whispered exhortations of Zanoni. When the last rose
from the corpse, and withdrew from that scene of confusion,
Glyndon remarked that in passing the crowd he touched
Mascari on the shoulder, and said something which the
Englishman did not overhear. Glyndon followed Zanoni
into the banquet-room, which, save where the moon-light
slept on the marble ﬂoor, was wrapt in the sad and gloomy
shadows of the advancing night.
“How could you foretell this fearful event? He fell
not by your arm ! ” said Glyndon, in a tremulous and
hollow tone.
“ The general who calculates on the victory does not
ﬁght in person,” answered Zanoni; “let the past sleep
with the dead. Meet me at midnight by the sea-shore,
half a mile to the left of your hotel. You will know the
spot by a rude pillar—the only one near—to which a
brokenehain is attached. There and then, if thou wouldst
learn our lore, thou shalt ﬁnd the master. Go ;-—I have
business here yet. Remember, Viola is still in the house
of the dead man I”
Here Mascari approached, and Zanoni, turning to the
Italian, and waving his hand to Glyndon, drew the former
aside. Glyndon slowly departed.

“Mascari,” said Zanoni, “your patron is no more;
your services will be valueless to his heir,—a sober man,
whom poverty has preserved from vice. For yourself,
thank me that I do not give you up to the executioner:
recollect the wine of Cyprus. Well, never tremble, man ;
it could not act on me, though it might re-act on others;
in that it is a common type of crime. I forgive you;
and if the wine should kill me, I promise you that my
ghost shall not haunt so worshipful a penitent. Enough
of this; conduct me to the chamber of Viola Pisani. You
have no further need of her. The death of the gaoler
opens the cell of the captive. Be quick, I would be
gone.”
Mascari muttered some inaudible words, bowed low,
and led the way to the chamber in which Viola was con-
ﬁned.

repaired to the appointed spot. The mysterious empire
which Zanoni had acquired over him, was still more sol~

the most common-place, and yet, associated with words
the most prophetic, impressed him with the deepest senti-
ments of admiration and awe. It was as if this dark and
wondrous being could convert the most ordinary events
and the meanest instruments into the agencies of his
inscrutable will ; yet, if so, why have permitted the capture
of Viola? Why not have prevented the crime, rather
than punish the criminal? And did Zanoni really feel
love for Viola? Love, and yet offer to resign her to
himself,— to a rival, whom his arts could not have failed
to baﬁle. He no longer reverted to the belief that Zanpni
or Viola had sought to dupe him into marriage. His
fear and reverence for the former now forbade the notion
of so poor an impostnre. Did he any longer love Viola
himself? No; when that morning he had heard of her
danger, he had, it is true, returned to the sympathies and
the fears of affection; but with the death of the Prince
her image faded again from his heart, and he felt no
jealous pang at the thought that she had been saved by
Zanoni,-— that at that moment she was perhaps beneath
his roof. Whoever has, in the course of his life, indulged
the absorbing passion of the gamester, will remember how
all other pursuits and objects vanished from his mind;
how solely he was wrapped in the one wild delusion ; with
what a sceptre of magic power the despot-demon ruled
every feeling and every thought. Far more intense than
the passion of the gamester was the frantic, yet sublime
desire, that mastered the breast of Glyndon. He would
be the rival of Zanoni, not in human and perishable

The night was most lovely and serene, and the waves
scarcely rippled at his feet, as the Englishman glided on
by the cool and starry beach. At length he arrived at
the spot, and there, leaning against the broken pillar, he
beheld a man wrapped in a long mantle, and in an attitude
of. profound repose. He approached, and uttered the
name of Zanoni. The ﬁgure turned, and he saw the face
of a stranger: a face not stamped by the glorious beauty
of Zanoni, but equally majestic in its aspect, and perhaps
still more impressive from the mature age and the passion-
less depth of thought that characterized the expanded
forehead, and deep-set but piercing eyes. I

herd, and panted, as the hart for the water-springs, for
the fountains that lie hid and far away amidst the broad
wilderness of trackless science ? The music of the fountain
is heard in the soul within, till the steps, deceived and
erring, rove away from its waters, and the wanderer dies
in the mighty desert. Think you that none who have
cherished the hope have found the truth? or that the
yearning after the Ineﬂ‘able Knowledge was given to _us
utterly in vain ? No ! Every desire in human hearts is
but a glimpse of things that exist, alike distant and divine.
No l in the world there have been, from age to age, some
brighter and happier spirits who have attained to the air
in which the beings above mankind move and breathe.
Zanoni, great though he be, stands not alone. He has
had his predecessors, and long lines of successors may be
yet to come.”
“And will you tell me,” said Glyndon, “that in your-
self I behold one of that mighty few over whom Zanoni
has no superiority in power and wisdom?”
“In me,” answered the stranger, “you see one from
whom Zanoni himself learned some of his loftiest secrets.

till indeed, the same race that gave its glory to the ancient
world bestowed a second youth upon the new. For the
pure Greek, the Hellenes, whose origin has bewildered
your dreaming scholars, were of the same great family as
the Norman tribe, born to be the lords of the universe,
and in no land on the earth destined to become the hewers
of wood. Even the dim traditions of the learned, which
bring the sons of Hellas from the vast and undetermined
territories of northern Thrace, to be the victors of the
pastoral Pelasgi, and the founders of the line of demi-
gods;—which assign to a population bronzed beneath
the suns of the west, the blue-eyed Minerva and the yellow-
haired Achilles (physical characteristics of the north) ;--
which introduce amongst a pastoral people, warlike aris-
tocracies, and limited monarchies, the feudalism of the
classic time; even these might serve you to trace back
the primeval settlements of the Hellenes to the same region
whence, in latter times, the Norman warriors broke on the
dull and savage hordes of the Celt, and became the Greeks
of the Christian world. But this interests you not, and
you are wise in your indifference. Not in the knowledge
of things without, but in the perfection of the soul within,
lies the empire of man aspiring to be more than man.”
“And what books contain that science ?_from what
laboratory is it wrought?”

deduced; in the wide bosom of the air; in the black
abysses of the earth ; everywhere are given to mortals the
resources and libraries of immortal lore. But as the
simplest problems in the simplest of all studies are obscure
to one who braces not his mind to their comprehension,
as the rower in yonder vessel cannot tell you why two
circles can touch each other only in one point; so, though
all earth were carved over and inscribed with the letters
of diviner knowledge, the characters would be valueless to
him who does not pause to inquire the language, and
meditate the truth. Young man, if thy imagination is
vivid, if thy heart is daring, if thy curiosity is insatiate,
I will accept thee as my pupil. But the ﬁrst lessons are
stern and dread.”
“ If thou hast mastered them, why not I Y ” answered
Glyndon, boldly. “I have felt from my boyhood that
strange mysteries were reserved for my career; and from
the proudest ends of ordinary ambition, I have carried my
gaze into the cloud and darkness that stretch beyond.
The instant I beheld Zanoni, I felt as if I had discovered
i the guide and the tutor for which my youth had idly
languished and vainly burned.”
“And to me his duty is transferred, ” replied the stranger.
“Yonder lies, anchored in the bay, the vessel in which
Zanoni seeks a fairer home; a little while and the breeze
will rise, the soil will swell, and the stranger will have
passed, like a wind, away. Still, like the wind, he leaves
in thy heart the seeds that may bear the blossoms and
the fruit. Zanoni hath performed his task. he is wanted

no more ; the perfecter of his work is at thy side.--- He
comes 1 ‘I hear the dash of the oar. You will have your
choice submitted to you. According as you decide, we
shall meet again.” With these words the stranger moved
slowly away, and disappeared beneath the shadow of the
cliffs. A boat glided rapidly across the waters; it
touched land; a man leapt on shore, and Glyndon recog-
nized Zanoni.
“ I give thee, Glyndon— I give thee no more the option
of happy love and serene enjoyment. That hour is past,
and fate has linked the hand that might have been thine
own, to mine. But I have ample gifts to bestow upon
thee, if thou wilt abandon the hope that gnaws thy heart,
and the realization of which, even I have not the power
to foresee. Be thine ambition human, and I can gratify
it to the full. Men desire four things in life—love,
wealth, fame, power. The ﬁrst I cannot give thee, the
rest are at my disposal. Select which of them thou wilt,
and let us part in peace.”
“Such are not the gifts I covet. Ichoose knowledge;
that knowledge must be thine own. For this, and for '
this alone, I surrendered the love of Viola; this and this
alone, must be my recompense.”
" I cannot gainsay thee, though I can warn. The
desire to learn does not always contain the faculty to
acquire. I can give thee, it is true, the teacher—the
test must depend on thee. Be wise in time, and take that
which I can assure to thee.”
“Answer me but these questions, and according to your

answer I will decide. Is it in the power of man to attain
intercourse with the beings of other worlds? Is it in the
power of man to inﬂuence the elements, and to insure life
against the sword and against disease?”
“All this may be-possible,” answered Zanoni, evasively,
" to the few. But for one who attains such secrets, millions
may perish in the attempt.”

“ One question more. Thou .”
“ Beware 1 Of myself, as I have said before, I render
no account.”
“Well, then, the stranger I have met this night, are
his boasts to be believed ? Is he in truth one of the
chosen seers whom you allow to have mastered the mys-
teries I yearn to fathom ?”
“ Rash man,” said Zanoni, in a tone of compassion, “thy
crisis is past, and thy choice made! I can only bid thee
be bold and prosper; yes, I resign thee to a master who
has the power and the will to open to thee the gates of
an awful world. Thy weal or woe are as nought in the
eyes of his relentless wisdom. I would bid him spare thee,
but he will heed me not. Mejnour, receive thy pupil l”
Glyndon turned, and his heart beat when he perceived that
the stranger, whose footsteps he had not heard upon the
pebbles, whose approach he had not beheld in the moon-
light, was once more by his side!
“Farewell,” resumed Zanoni; “thy trial commences.
When next we meet, thou wilt be the victim or the victor."
Glyndon’s eyes followed the receding form of the mys-
terious stranger. He saw him enter the boat, and he then

for the ﬁrst time noticed that besides the rowers there
was a female, who stood up as Zanoni gained the boat
Even at the distance, he recognized the once adored form
of Viola. She waved her hand to him, and across the
still and shining air came her voice, mournfully and sweetly
in her mother’s tongue -—“ Farewell, Clarence — I forgive
thee ! — farewell, farewell l”
He strove to answer, but the voice touched a chord at
his heart, and the words failed him. Viola was then lost
for ever; gone with this dread stranger; darkness was
round her lotl And he himself had decided her fate and
his own! The boat bounded on, the soft waves ﬂashed
and sparkled beneath the oars, and it was along one sap-
phire track of moonlight that the frail vessel bore away
the lovers. Farther, and farther from his gaze, sped the
boat, till at last the speck, scarcely visible, touched the
side of the ship that lay lifeless in the glorious bay. At
that instant, as if by magic, up sprang, with a glad mur-
mur, the playful and freshening wind ; and Glyndon turned
to Mejnour and broke the silence.
“Tell me (if thou canst read the future), tell me that
herlot will be fair, and that her choice at least is wise ? ”
“ My pupil l ” answered Mejnour, in a voice the calm-
ness of which well accorded with the chilling wens, “ thy
ﬁrst task must be to withdraw all thought, feeling, sym-
pathy from others. The elementary stage of knowledge
is to make self, and self alone, thy study and thy world.
Thou hast decided thine own career; thou hast renounced
love; thou hast rejected wealth, fame, and the vulgar

-“And will happiness be the end?”
“ If happiness exist,” answered Mejnour, “it must be
centered in a SELF to which all passion is unknown. But
happiness is the last state of being; and as yet thou art
on the threshold of the ﬁrst.”
As Mejnour spoke, the distant vessel spread its sails to
the wind, and moved slowly along the deep. Glyndon
sighed, and the pupil and the master retraced their step:
towards the city.

IT was about a mouth after the date of Zanoni’s de-
parture, and Glyndon’s introduction to Mejuour, when two
Englishmen were walking, arm 'in arm, through the Toledo.
“I tell you,” said one (who spoke warmly), “that if
you have a particle of common sense left in you, you will
accompany me to England. This Mejnour is an impostor
more dangerous, because more in earnest, than Zanoni.
After all, what do his promises amount to? You allow
that nothing can be more equivocal. You say that he
has left N aples-that he has selected a retreat more con-

genial than the crowded thoroughfares of men to the studies
in which he is to initiate you; and this retreat is among
the haunts of the ﬁercest bandits of Italy -_ haunts which
justice itself dares not penetrate. Fitting hermitage for
a sage! I tremble for you. What if this stranger of
whom nothing is known —be leagued with the robbers ;
and these lures for your credulity bait but the traps for
your property—perhaps your life? You might come
off cheaply by a ransom of half your fortune. You smile
indignantly 1 Well; put common sense out of the ques-
tion; take your own view of the matter. You are to
undergo an ordeal which Mejnour himself does not profess
to describe as a very tempting one. It may, or it may
not succeed; if it does not, you are menaced with the
darkest evils; and if it does, you cannot be better off than
the dull and joyless mystic whom you have taken for a
master. Away with this folly; enjoy youth while it is
left to you. Return with me to England; forget these
dreams; enter your proper career; form affections more
respectable than those which lured you awhile to an
Italian adventuress. Attend to your fortune, make money,
and become a happy and distinguished man. This is the
advice of sober friendship ; yet the promises I hold out to
you are fairer than those of Mejnour.”
“ Mervale,” said Glyndon, doggedly, “I cannot, if I
would, yield to your wishes. A power that is above me
urges me on ; I cannot resist its inﬂuence. I will proceed
to the last in the strange career I have commenced. Think

of me no more. Follow yourself the advice you give to
me, and be happy.”
“ This is madness,” said Mervale; “your health is
already failing; you are so changed I should scarcely
know you. Come ; I have already had your name entered
in my passport ; in another hour I shall be gone, and you,
boy that you are, will be left without a friend, to the
deceits of your own fancy and the machinations of this
relentless mountebank.”
“Enough,” said Glyndon, coldly; “you cease to be an
effective counsellor when you suffer your prejudices to be
thus evident. I have already had ample proof,” added
the Englishman, and his pale cheek grew more pale, “ of
the power of this man ——if man he be, which I sometimes
doubt—and, come life, come death, I will not shrink from
the paths that allure me. Farewell, Mervale, if we never
meet again, if you hear, amidst our old and cheerful haunts,
that Clarence Glyndon sleeps the last sleep by the shores
of Naples, or amidst you distant hills, say to the friends
of our youth —‘He died worthily, as thousands of Martyr-
students have died before him, in the pursuit of know-
ledge.’”
He wrung Mervale’s hand as he spoke, darted from his
side, and disappeared amidst the crowd. ,
By the corner of the Toledo, he was arrested by Nicot
“Ah, Glyndon l I have not seen you this month. Where
have you hid yourself? Have you been absorbed in your
studies?” 7
“Yes.”

“I am about to leave Naples for Paris. Will you
accompany me? Talent of all order is eagerly sought
for there, and will be sure to rise.”
“ I thank you ; I have other schemes for the present.”
“ So laconic ! -what ails you ? Do you grieve for the
loss of the Pisani ? Take example by me. I have.already
consoled myself with Bianca Sacchini—a handsome woman
—enlightened-no prejudices. A valuable creature I
shall ﬁnd her, no doubt. But as for this Zanoni!”
“ What of him?”
“ If ever I paint an allegorical subject, I will take his
likeness as Satan. Ha, ha ! a true painter’s revenge—
eh? And the way of the world, too ! When we can do
nothing else against a man whom we hate, we can at least
paint his eﬂigies as the Devil’s. Seriously, though: I
abhor that man."
“Wherefore?”
“ Wherefore ! Has he not carried off the wife and the
dowry I had marked for myself? Yet, after all,” added
Nicot, musingly, “ had he served instead of injured me, I
should have hated him all the same. His very form, and
his very face, made me at once envy and detest him. I
feel that there is something antipathetie in our natures.
I feel, too, that we shall meet again, when Jean Nicot’s
hate may be less impotent. We, too, che'r confréreﬂ
we, too, may meet again! Viva la République! I to

“And I to mine. Farewell!”

Glyndon also quitted the City of Delight alone, and on
horseback. He bent his way into those picturesque but
dangerous parts of the country, which at that time were
infested by banditti, and which few travellers dared to
pass, even in broad day-light, without a strong escort.
A road more lonely cannot well be conceived than that
on which the hoofs of his steed, striking upon the frag-
ments of rock that encumbered the neglected way, woke
a dull and melancholy echo. Large tracts of waste land,
varied by the rank and profuse foliage of the South, lay
before him ; occasionally, a wild goat peeped down from
some rocky crag, or the discordant cry of a bird of prey,
startled in its sombre haunt, was heard above the hills.
These were the only signs of life; not a human being
was met—not a but was visible. Wrapped in his own
ardent and solemn thoughts, the young man continued
his way, till the sun had spent its noon-day heat, and a
breeze that announced the approach of eve, sprung up
from the unseen ocean which lay far distant to his right.
It was then that a turn in the road brought before him
one of those long, desolate, gloomy villages which are
found in the interior of the Neapolitan dominions; and
now he came upon a small chapel on one side the road,
With a gaudily painted image of the Virgin in the open
shrine. Around this spot, which, in the heart of a Christian
land, retained the vestige of the old idolatry (for just such
were the chapels that in the pagan age were dedicated to
the demon-saints of mythology), gathered six or seven
miserable and squalid wretches, whom the Curse of the

Leper had cut oﬂ' from mankind. They set up a shrill
cry as they turned their ghastly visages towards the horse-
man; and without stirring from the spot, stretched out
their gaunt arms, and implored charity in the name of the
Merciful Mother] Glyndon hastily threw them some
small coins, and, turning away his face, clapped spurs to
his horse, and relaxed not his speed till he entered the
village. On either side the narrow and miry street, ﬁerce
and haggard forms—some leaning against the ruined
walls of blackened huts, some seated at the threshold,
some lying at full length in the mud -presented groups
that at once invoked pity and aroused alarm: pity for
their squalor, alarm for their ferocity imprinted on their
savage aspects. They gazed at him, grim and sullen, as
he rode slowly up the rugged street; sometimes whispering
signiﬁcantly to each other, but without attempting to stop
his way. Even the children hushed their babble, and
ragged urchins devouring him with sparkling eyes, mut-
tered to their mothers, “We shall feast well to~morr0w l”
It was, indeed, one of those hamlets in which Law sets
not its sober step, in which Violence and Murder house
secure—hamlets common then in the wilder parts of Italy,
-_-in which the peasant was but the gentler name for the
robber.
Glyndon’s heart somewhat failed him as he looked
around, and the question he desired to ask died upon his
lips. At_length, from one of the dismal cabins emerged
a'form superior to the'rest. Instead of the patched and
ragged overall, which made the only garment of the men

he had hitherto seen, the dress of this person was charac~
terized by all the trappings of the national bravery. Upon
his raven hair, thepglossy curls of which made a notable
contrast to the matted and elﬁn locks of the savages
around, was placed a cloth cap with a gold tassel that
hung down to his shoulder; his moustaches were trimmed
with care, and a silk k'erchief of gay hues was twisted
round a well-shaped but sinewy throat; a short jacket
of rough cloth was decorated with several rows of gilt
ﬁlagree buttons; his nether garments ﬁtted tight to his
limbs, and were curiously braided; while, in a broad
parti-colored sash, were placed two silver-hilted pistols,
and the sheathed knife, usually worn by Italians of the
lower order, mounted in ivory elaborately carved. A small
carbine of handsome workmanship was slung across his
shoulder, and completed his costume. The man himself
was of middle size, athletic yet slender, with straight and
regular features, sun-'burnt, but not swarthy; and an
expression of countenance which, though reckless and
bold, had in it frankness rather than ferocity, and, if defy-
ing, was not altogether unprepossessing.
Glyndon, after eyeing this ﬁgure for some moments
with great attention, checked his rein, and asked the way
to the “Castle of the Mountain.”
The man lifted his cap as he heard the question, and,
approaching Glyndon, laid his hand upon the neck of the
horse, and said,in a low voice, “Then you are the cavalier
whom our patron the signor expected. He bade me' wait
for you here, and lead you to the castle. And indeed,

signer, it might have been unfortunate if I had neglected
to obey the command.”
The man then, drawing a little aside, called out to the
by-standers, in a loud voice, “Ho, ho! my friends, pay
henceforth and for ever all respect to this worshipful
cavalier. He is the expected guest of our blessed patron
of the Castle of the Mountain. Long life to him! May
he, like his best, be safe by day and by night—on the
hill and in the waste—against the dagger and the bullet
-—in limb and in life! Cursed be he who touches a hair
of his head, or a baioccho in his pouch. Now and for
ever we will protect and honor him—for the law or against
the} law — with the faith, and to the death. Amen l
\ Amen ! ” '
“Amen l” responded, in wild chorus, a hundred voices;
and the scattered and straggling groups pressed up the
street, nearer and nearer to the horseman.
“And that he may be known,” continued the English~
man’s strange protector, “to the eye and to the ear, I
place around him the white sash, and I give him the sacred
watch-word —‘ Peace to the Brace.’ Signor, when you
wear this sash, the proudest in these parts will bare the
head and bend the knee. Signor, when you utter this
watch-word, the bravest hearts will be bound to your bid-
ding. Desire you safety, or ask you revenge _‘to gain
a beauty, or to lose a foe—speak but the word, and we
are yours,- we are'yours l Is it not so, comrades?”
And again the hoarse voices shouted “Amen, Amen l ”
“Now, signor,” whispered the bravo, “if you have a

few coins to spare, scatter them amongst the crowd, and
let us be gone.”
Glyndon, not displeased at the concluding sentence,
emptied his purse in the streets; and while, with mingled
oaths, blessings, shrieks, and yells, men, women, and chil-
dren scrambled for the money, the bravo, taking the rein
of the horse, led it a few paces through the village at a
brisk trot, and then, turning up a narrow lane to the left,
in a few minutes neither houses nor men were visible, and
the mountains closed their path on either side. It was
then that, releasing the bridle and slackening his pace,
the guide turned his dark eyes on Glyndon with an arch
expression, and said—
“Your Excellency was not, perhaps, prepared for the
hearty welcome we have given you.”
“ Why, in truth, I ought to have been prepared for it,
since the signor, to whose house I am bound, did not
disguise from me the character of the neighborhood.
And your name, my friend, if I may so call you ?”
“ Oh, no ceremonies with me, Excellency. In the
village I am generally called Maestro Paolo. I had a
surname once, though a very equivocal one; and I have
forgotten that since I retired from the world.”
“And was it from disgust, from poverty, or from some
-— some ebullition of passion which entailed punishment,
that you betook yourself to the mountains ? ” ,
“Why, signor,” said the bravo, with a gay laugh,
“ hermits of my class seldom leve the confessional. How-
ever, I have no secrets while my step is in these deﬁles,

my whistle in my pouch, and my carbine at my back.”
With that the robber, as if he loved permission to talk
at his will, hemmed thrice, and began with much humor;
though as his tale proceeded, the memories it roused
seemed to carry him farther than he at ﬁrst intended, and
reckless and light-hearted ease gave way to that ﬁerce
and varied play of countenance and passion of gesture
which characterize the emotions of his countrymen.
v “I was born at Terracina—a fair spot, is it not? My
father was a learned monk, of high birth ; my mother——
Heaven rest her i —- an inn-keeper’s pretty daughter. Of
course there could be no marriage in the case ; and when
I was born, the monk gravely declared my appearance to
be miraculous. I was dedicated from my cradle to the
altar; and my head was universally declared to be the
orthodox shape for a cowl. As I grew up, the monk
took great pains with my education; and I learned Latin
and psalmody as soon as less miraculous infants learn
crowing. Nor did the holy man’s care stint itself to my
interior accomplishments. Although vowed to poverty,
he always contrived that my mother should have her
pockets full; and between her pockets and mine there
was soon established a clandestine communication; ac-
cordingly, at fourteen, I wore my cap on one side, stuck
pistols in my belt, and assumed the swagger of a cavalier
and a gallant. At that age my poor mother died; and
about the same period, my father, having written a History
of the Pontiﬁcal Bulls, in forty volumes, and being, as I
said, of high birth, obtained a Cardinal’s hat. From

that time he thought ﬁt to disown your humble servant.
He bound me over to an honest notary at Naples, and
gave me two hundred crowns by way of provision. Well,
signor, I saw enough of the law to convince me that I
should never be rogue enough to shine in the profession.
So, instead of spoiling parchment, I made love to the
notary’s daughter. My master discovered our innocent
amusement, and turned me out of doors: that was dis-
agreeable. But my Ninetta loved me, and took care that
I should not lie out in the streets with the Lazzaroni.
Little jade, I think I see her now with her bare feet and
her ﬁnger to her lips, opening the door in the summer
nights, and bidding me creep softly into the kitchen,
where, praised be the saints l a ﬂask and a manchet always
awaited the hungry amoroso. At last, however, Ninetta
grew cold. It is the way of the sex, signor. Her father
found her an excellent marriage in the person of a withered
old picture-dealer. She took the spouse, and very pro-
perly clapped the door in the face of her lover. I was
not disheartened, Excellency; no, not I. Women are
plentiful while we are young. So, without a ducat in
my pocket, or a crust for my 'teeth, I set out to seek my
fortune on board of a Spanish merchantman. That was
duller work than 1 expected ; but luckily we were attacked
by a pirate -half the crew were butchered, the rest cap-
tured. I was one ofthe last-always in luck, you see,
signor -- monks’ sons have a knack that way! The
captain of the pirates took a fancy to me. ‘ Serve with
us?’ said he. ‘ T00 happy,’ said I. Behold me, then,

a plratel O jolly life 1 how I blessed the old notary for
turning me out of doors! What feasting, what ﬁghting,
what wooing, what quarrelling l Sometimes we ran ashore
and enjoyed ourselves like princes: sometimes we lay in
a calm for days together on the loveliest sea that man
ever traversed. And then, if the breeze rose and a sail
came in sight, who so merry as we? I passed three years
in that charming profession, and then, signor, I grew
ambitious. I caballed against the captain; I wanted
his post. One still night we struck the blow. The ship
was like a log in the sea, no land to be seen from the
mast-head, the waves like glass, and the moon at its full.
Up we rose; thirty of us and more. Up we rose with a
shout : we poured into the captain’s cabin, I at the head.
The brave old boy had caught the alarm, and there he
stood at the door-way, a pistol in each hand; and his
one eye (he had only one l) worse to meet than the pistols
were.
“ ‘ Yield l ’ cried I, ‘your life shall be safe.’
“ ‘ Take that,’ said he, and whiz went the bullet; but
the saints took care of their own, and the ball passed by
my cheek, and shot the boatswain behind me. I closed
with the captain, and the other pistol went off without
mischief in the struggle Such a fellow he was -- six
feet four without his shoes! Over we went, rolling each
on the other. Santa Marial no time to get hold of one’s
knife. Meanwhile all the crew were up, some for the
captain, some for me'—-clashing and ﬁring, and swearing

it came, but not to mytheart. No l I gave my left arm
as a shield ; and the blade went through to the hilt, with _

With the weight of the blow the stout fellow came down,
so that his face touched mine; with my right hand I_ caught
him by the throat, turned him over like a lamb, signor,
and faith it was soon all up with him—the boatswaiu’s
brother, a fat Dutchman, ran him through with a pike.
“ ‘ Old fellow,’ said I, as he turned his terrible eye to
me, ‘ I bear you no malice, but we must try to get on in
the world, you know.’ The captain grinned, and gave up
the ghost. I went upon deck—what a sight! Twenty
bold fellows stark and cold, and the moon sparkling on
the puddles of blood as calmly as if it were water. Well,
signor, the victory was ours, and the ship mine ; I ruled
merrily enough for six months. We then attacked a
French ship twice our size; what sport it wasl And
we had not had a good ﬁght so long, we were quite like
virgins at it! We got the best of it, and won ship and
cargo. They wanted to pistol the captain, but that was
against my laws; so we gagged him, for he scolded as
loud as if we were married to him ; left him and the rest
of his crew on board our own vessel, which was terribly
battered; clapped our black ﬂag on the Frenchman’s, and
set off merrily, with a brisk wind in our favor. But luck
deserted us on forsaking our own dear old ship. A storm

two days and two nights we suﬁ'ered horribly; but at last
we ran ashore near a French sea-"port. Our sorry plight
moved compassion, and as we had money, we were not
suspected—people only suspect the poor. Here we soon
recovered our fatigues, rigged ourselves out gaily, and
your humble servant was considered as noble a captain
as ever walked deck. But now, alas, my fate would have
it that I should fall in love with a silk-mercer’s daughter.
Ah, how I loved her ! —the pretty Clara ! Yes, I loved
her so well, that I was seized with horror at my past life l
I resolved to repent, to marry her, and settle down into
an honest man. Accordingly, I summoned my messmates,
told them my resolution, resigned my command, and per-
suaded them to depart. They were good fellows; engaged
with a Dutchman, against whom I heard afterwards they
made a successful mutiny, but I never saw them more.
I had two thousand crowns still left; with this sum I
obtained the consent of the silk-mercer, and it was agreed
that I should become a partner in the ﬁrm. I need not
say that no one suspected that I had been so great a. man,
and I passed for a Neapolitan goldsmith’s son, instead of
a cardinal’s. I was very happy then, signor, very-I

day was ﬁxed for our wedding—it approached. On the
evening before the appointed day, Clara, her mother, her
little sister, and myself, were walking by the port; and
as we looked on the sea, I was telling them old gossip-
tales of mermaids and sea-serpents, when a red-faced
bottle-nosed Frenchman clapped himself right before me,
and placing his spectacles very deliberately astride his
proboscis, echoed out, ‘Sacré mille tonnerres.’ this is
the damned pirate who boarded the Niobe!’
“ ‘ None of your jests,’ said I, mildly. ‘ Ho, ho 1’ said
he ; ‘ I can’t be mistaken; help there 1 ’ and he griped me
by the collar. I replied, as you may suppose, by laying
him in the kennel: but it would not do. The French
captain had a French lieutenant at his back, whose memory
wasas good as his chief’s. A crowd assembled; other
sailors came up; the odds were against me. I slept that
night in prison; and in a few weeks afterwards, I was
sent to the galleys. They spared my life, because the old
Frenchman politely averred that I had made my crew
spare his. You may believe that the oar and the chain
was not to my taste. I and two others escaped, they
took to the road, and have, no dpubt, been long since
broken on the wheel. I, soft soul, would not commit
another crime to gain my bread, for Clara was still at my
heart with her sweet eyes: so, limiting my rogueries to
the theft of a beggar’s rags, which I compensated by
leaving him my galley attire instead, I begged my way
to the town where I left Clara. It was a clear winter’s
day when I approached the outskirts of the town. 1

had no fear of detection, for my beard and hair was as
good as a mask. Oh. Mother of Mercy ! there came
across my way a funeral procession! There, now you
know it; I can tell you no more. She had died, perhaps
of love, more likely of shame. Can you guess how I
spent that nightf—I stole a pickaxe from a mason’s
shed, and all alone and unseen, under the frosty heavens,
I dug the fresh mould from the grave ; I lifted the cofﬁn,
1 wrenched the lid, I saw her again—again! Decay
had not touched her. She was always pale -in life! I
could have sworn she lived! It was a blessed thing to
see her once more, and all alone too 1 But then, at dawn,
to‘give her back to the earth -to close the lid, to throw
down the mould, to hear the pebbles rattle on the cofﬁn
—-that was dreadful ! Signor, I never knew before, and
I don’t wish to think now, how valuable a thing human
life is. At sunrise I was again a wanderer; but now that
Clara was gone, my scruples vanished, and again I was at

war with my betters. I contrived at last, at O , to
get taken on board a vessel bound to Leghorn, working
out my passage. From Leghorn I went to Rome, and
stationed myself at the door of the cardinal’s palace. Out

to the Vatican. His purse which he had left behind was
well supplied. I was grateful and contented, and took
my way to Terracina. I had not long passed the marshes,
when I saw two horsemen approach at a canter.
“‘You look poor, friend,’ said one of them, halting
‘yet you are strong.’
“ ‘ Poor men and strong are both serviceable and dan-
gerous, Signor Cavalier.’
“‘Well said; follow us.’ .

and as I have always been mild in my calling, and have
taken purses without cutting throats, I bear an excellent

have settled in these parts, where I hold sway, and where
I have purchased land. I am called a farmer, signor;
and I myself now only rob for amusement, and to keep
my hand in. I trust I have satisﬁed your curiosity. We
are within a hundred yards of the castle.”
“And how,” asked the Englishman, whose interest had
been much excited by his companion’s narrative, “ and
how came you acquainted with my host ?-_and by what
means has he so well conciliated the good-will of yourself
and friends?”
Maestro Paolo turned his black eyes very gravely to-
wards his questioner. “ Why, signor,” said be, “you must

surely know more of the foreign cavalier with the hard
name than I do. All I can say is, that about a fortnight
ago I chanced to be standing by a booth in the Toledo
at Naples, when a sober-looking gentleman touched me
by the arm, and said, ‘Maéstro Paolo, I want to make
your acquaintance; do me the favor to come in to yonder
tavern, and drink a ﬂask of lacrima.’ ‘ Willingly,’ said I.
So we entered the tavern. When we were seated, my
new acquaintance thus accosted me: ‘ The Count d’O-—-
has offered to let me hire his old castle near B . You
know the spot?’

“ ‘ Extremely well ; no one has inhabited it for a century
at least; it is half in ruins, signor. A queer place to
hire; I hope the rent is not heavy.’
“‘Maéstro Paolo,’ said he, ‘I am a philosopher, and
don’t care. for luxuries. want a quiet retreat for some
scientiﬁc experiments. The castle will suit me very well,
provided you will accept me as a neighbor, and place me
and my friends under your special protection. I am rich;
but I shall take nothing to the castle worth robbing. I
will pay one rent to the count, and another to you.’
“ With that we soon came to terms; and as the strange
signor doubled the sum I myself proposed, he is in high
favor with all his neighbors. We would guard the whole
castle against an army. And now, signor, that I have
been thus frank, be frank with me. Who is this singular
cavalier ?”
“ Who ?—he himself told you, a philosopher.”

“Hem! searching for the philosopher’s stone,— eh?
a bit of a magician ; afraid of the priests ? ”
“Precisely. You have hit it.”
“I thought so; and you are his pupil?”
“ I am.” .
“ I wish you well through it,” said the robber seriously,
and crossing himself with much devotion: “I am not
much better than other people, but one’s soul is one’s
soul. I do not mind a little honest robbery, or knocking
a man on the head if need be—but to make a bargain
with the devil l --Ah I take care, young gentleman, take
care.”
“You need not fear,” said Glyndon, smiling; “my
preceptor is too wise and too good for such a compact.
But here we are, I suppose. A noble ruin —a glorious
prospect!”
Glyndon paused delightedly, and surveyed the scene,
before and below with the eye of a painter. Insensibly,
while listening to the bandit, he had wound up a consid-
erable ascent, and now he was upon a broad ledge of rock
covered with mosses and dwarf shrubs. Between this
eminence and another of equal height upon which the
castle was built, there was a deep but narrow ﬁssure,
overgrown with the most profuse foliage, so that the eye
could not penetrate many yards below the rugged surface
of the abyss; but the profoundness might be well con-
jectured by the hoarse, low, monotonous roar of waters
unseen that rolled below, and the subsequent course of
which was visible at a distance in a perturbed and rapid

stream, that intersected the waste and desolate valleys.
To the left, the prospect seemed almost boundless; the
extreme clearness of the purple air serving to render
distinct the features of a range of country that a conqueror
of old might have deemed in itself a kingdom. Lonely
and desolate as the road which Glyndon had passed that
day had appeared, the landscape now seemed studded
with castles, spires, and villages. Afar oﬁ', Naples gleamed '
whitely in the last rays of the sun, and the rose-tints of
the horizon melted into the azure of her glorious bay.
Yet more remote, and in another part of the prospect,
might be caught, dim and shadowy, and backed by the
darkest foliage, the ruined pillars of the ancient Posidonia.
There, in the midst of his blackened and sterile realms,
rose the dismal Mount of Fire ; while, on the other hand,
winding through variegated plains, to which distance lent
all its magic, glittered many and many a stream, by which
Etruscan and Sybarite, Roman and Saracen, and Norman,
had, at intervals of ages, pitched the invading tent. All
the visions of the past—the stormy and dazzling histories
of southern Italy—~rushed over the artist’s mind as he
gazed below. And then, slowly turning to look behind,
he saw the grey and mouldering walls of the castle, in
which he sought the secrets that were to give to hope in
the Future a mightier empire than memory owns in the
Past. It was one of those baronial fortresses with which
Italy. was studded in the earlier middle ages, having but
little of the Gothic grace or grandeur which belongs to
the ecclesiastical architecture of the same time ; but rude.

vast, and menacing, even, in decay. A wooden bridge
was thrown over the chasm, wide enough to admit two
horsemen abreast; and the planks trembled and gave
back a hollow sound as Glyndon urged his jaded steed
across.
A road which had once been broad and paved with
rough ﬂags, but which now was half-obliterated by long
grass and rank weeds, conducted to the outer court of
the castle hard by; the gates were open, and half the
building in this part was dismantled ; the ruins partially ;
hid by ivy that was the growth of centuries. But on
entering the inner court, Glyndon was not sorry to notice
that there was less appearance of neglect and decay ; some
wild roses gave a smile to the grey walls, and in the centre
there was a fountain, in which the waters still trickled
coolly, and with a pleasing murmur, from the jaws of a
gigantic Triton. Here he was met by Mejnour with a
smile.
“Welcome, my friend and pupil,” said he; “ he who
seeks for Truth can ﬁnd in these solitudes an immortal
Academe.”

And Abaris, so far from esteeming Pythagoras, who taught these
things, a necrcmancer or wizard, rather revered and admired him
as something divine.— hammer-1., Vit. Pythag.
THE attendants whom Mejnour had engaged for his
strange abode, were such as might suit a philosopher of
few wants. An old Armenian, whom Glyndon recognized
as in the mystic’s service at Naples; a tall, hard-featured
woman from the village, recommended by Maestro Paolo,
and two long-haired, smooth-spoken, but ﬁerce-visaged
youths from the same place, and honored by the same
sponsorship, constituted the establishment. The rooms
used by the sage were commodious and weather-proof,
with some remains of ancient splendor in the faded arras
that clothed the walls, and the huge tables of costly
marble and elaborate carving. Glyndon’s sleeping apart-
ment communicated with a kind of Belvidere, or terrace,
that commanded prospects of unrivalled beauty and extent,
and was separated on the other side by along gallery,
and a ﬂight of ten or a dozen stairs, from the private
chambers of the mystic. There was about the whole
place a sombre and yet not displeasing depth of repose.
It suited well with the studies to which it was now to be
appropriated.
For several days Mejnour refused to confer with Glyn-
don on the subjects nearest to his heart.

"
“All without,” said he, “is prepared, but not all within ,‘1 ,
your own soul must grow accustomed to the spot, and
ﬁlled with the surrounding nature ; for nature is the source
of all inspiration.”
With these words Mejnour turned to lighter topics.
He made the Englishman accompany him in long rambles
through the wild scenes around, and he smiled approv—
ingly when the young artist gave way to the enthusiasm
which their fearful beauty could not have failed to rouse
in a duller breast; and then Mejnour poured forth to his
wondering pupil the stores of a knowledge that seemed
inexhaustible and boundless. He gave accounts the most
curious, graphic, and minute, of the various races (their
characters, habits, creeds, and manners) by which that
fair land had been successively overrun. It is true that
his descriptions could not be found in books, and were
unsupported by learned authorities; but he possessed the
true charm of the tale-teller, and spoke of all with the
animated conﬁdence of a personal witness. Sometimes,
too, he would converse upon the more durable and the
loftier mysteries of Nature with an eloquence and a re-
search which invested them with all the colors rather of
poetry than science. Insensibly the young artist found
himself elevated and soothed by the lore of his companion;
the fever of his wild desires was slaked. His mind became
more and more lulled into the divine tranquillity of con-
templation; he felt himself a nobler being; and in the
silence of his senses he imagined that he heard the voice
of his soul.

It was to this state that Mejnour evidently sought to
. bring the Neophyte, and in this elementary initiation the
mystic was like every more ordinary sage. For he who
seeks to DISCOVER, must ﬁrst reduce himself into a kind
of abstract idealism, and be rendered up, in solemn and
sweet bondage, to the faculties which CONTEMPLATE and
IMAGINE.
Glyndon noticed that, in their rambles, Mejnour often
paused where the foliage was rifest, to gather some herb
or ﬂower ; and this reminded him that he had seen 'Zanoni
similarly occupied. “ Can these humble children of nature,”
said he one day to Mejnour, “things that bloom and
wither in a day, be serviceable to the science of the higher
secrets? Is there a pharmacy for the soul as well as the
body, and do the nurslings of the summer minister not
only to human health but spiritual immortality ?”
“If,” answered Mejnour, “a stranger had visited a
wandering tribe before one property of herbalism was
known to them ; if he had told the savages that the herbs,
which they trampled under foot, Were endowed with the
most potent virtues; that one would restore to health a
brother on the verge of death ; that another would paralyze
into idiocy their wisest sage; that athird would strike life-
less to the dust their most stalwart champion ; that tears
and laughter, vigor and disease, madness and reason, wake-
fulness and sleep, existence and dissolution, were coiled
up in those unregarded leaves,-wonld they not have held
him a sorcorer or a liar? To half the virtues of the vegeta-
ble world mankind are yet in the darkness of the savages

I have supposed. There are faculties within us with which
certain herbs have aﬂinity, and over which they have
power. The moly of the ancients is not all a fable.”
The apparent character of Mejnour differed in much
from that of Zanoni ; and while it fascinated Glyndon less,
it subdued and impressed him more. The conversation
of Zanoni evinced a deep and general interest for mankind
— a feeling approaching to enthusiasm for Art and Beauty.
The stories circulated concerning his habits elevated the
mysteries of his life by actions of charity and beneﬁcence.
And in all this, there was something genial and humane
that softened the aWe he created, and tended, perhaps, to
raise suspicions as to the loftier secrets that he arrogated
to himself. But Mejnour seemed wholly indifferent to all
the actual world. If he committed no evil, he seemed
equally apathetic to good. His deeds relieved no want,
his words pitied no distress. What we call the heart
appeared to have merged into the intellect. He moved,
thought, and lived, like some regular and calm Abstrac-
tion, rather than one who yet retained, with the form, the
feelings and sympathies of his kind!
Glyndon once, observing the tone of supreme indifference
with which he spoke of those changes on the face of earth,
which he asserted he had witnessed, ventured to remark to
him the distinction he had noted.
“ It is true,” said Mejnour, coldly. “My life is the
life that contemplates —Zan0ni’s is the life that enjoys;
when I gather the herb, I think but of its uses; Zanoni
will pause to admire its beauties.”

“And you deem your own the superior and the loftier
/existence ?”
“No. His is the existence of youth —mine of age.
We have cultivated different faculties. Each has powers
the other cannot aspire to. Those with whom he associates,
livc better—those who associate with me, know more.”
“ I have heard, in truth,” said Glyndon, “ that his com-
panions at Naples were observed to lead purer and nobler
lives after intercourse with Zanoni; yet were they not
strange companions, at the best, for a sage ? This terrible
power, too, that he exercises at will, as in the death of
the Prince di , and that of the Count Ughelli, scarcely
becomes the tranquil seeker after good.”

“ True,” said Mejnour, with an icy smile : “such must
ever be the error of those philosophers who would meddle
with the active life of mankind. You cannot serve some
without injuring others; you cannot protect the good
without warring on the bad; and if you desire to reform
the faulty, why, you must lower yourself to live with the
faulty to know their faults. Even so saith Paracelsus, a
great man, though often wrong.* Not mine this folly;
I live but in knowledge—I have no life in mankind!”
Another time Glyndon questioned the mystic as to the
nature of that union or fraternity to which Zanoni had
once referred.
“ I am right, I suppose,” said he, “in conjecturing that

you and himself profess to be the brothers of the Rosy
Cross .7”
“Do you imagine,” answered Mejnour, “ that there
were no mystic and solemn unions of men seeking the
same end through the same means, before the Arabians
of Damus, in 1378, taught to a wandering German the
secrets which founded the Institution of the Rosicrucians?
I allow, however, that the Rosicrucians formed a sect
descended from the greater and earlier school. They
were wiser than the Alchemists—their masters are wiser
than they.”
“And of this early and primary order how many still
exist .7 ”
“Zanoni and myself.”
“What, two only l—and you profess the power to

out of the will of Heaven. These walls may crush me as
I stand. All that we profess to do is but this—to ﬁnd
out the secrets of the human frame, to know why the parts
ossify and the blood stagnates, and to apply continual
preventives to the effects of Time. This is not Magic ;
it is the Art of Medicine rightly understood. In our
order we hold most noble_- ﬁrst, that knowledge which
elevates the intellect; secondly, that which preserves the

only hint to thee at present, by which HEAT or oanoarc,
as ye call it, being, as Heraclitus wisely taught, the prim-
ordial principle of life, can be made its perpetual renovator
_these, I say, would not sufﬁce for safety. It is ours
also to disarm and elude the wrath of men, to turn the
swords of our foes against each other, to glide _(if not
incorporeal) invisible to eyes over which we can throw
a mist and darkness. And this some seers have professed
to be the virtue of a stone of agate. Abaris placed it
in his arrow. I will ﬁnd you an herb in you valley that
will give a surer charm than the agate and the arrow.
In one word, know this, that the humblest and meanest
products of Nature are those from which the sublimest
properties are to be drawn.”
“But,” said Glyndon, “if possessed of these great
secrets, why so churlish in withholding their diffusion?
Does not the false or charlatanic science differ in this
from the true and indisputable --that the last commu-
nicates to the world the process by which it attains its
discoveries; the ﬁrst boasts of marvellous results, and
refuses to explain the causes?”
“Well said, O Logician of the Schools; _but think

privilege be accorded also to the good ; and in what state
would be society? Engaged in a Titan war—the good
for ever on the defensive, the bad for ever in the assault.
In the present condition of the earth, evil is a more active
principle than good, and the evil would prevail. It is for
these reasons that we are not only solemnly bound to
administer our lore only to those who will not misuse and
pervert it; but that we place our ordeal in tests that
purify the passions and elevate the desires. And Nature
in this controls and assists us: for it places awful guar-
dians and insurmountable barriers between the ambition
of vice and the heaven of the loftier science.”
Such made a small part of the numerous conversations _
Mejnour held with his pupil,- conversations that, while
they appeared to address themselves to the reason, inﬂamed
yet more the fancy. It was the very disclaiming of all
powers which Nature, properly investigated, did not sufﬁce
to create, that gave an air of probability to those which
Mejnour asserted Nature might bestow. '
Thus days and weeks rolled on; and the mind of Glyn-

forgot at last the vanities and chimeras of the world with-

a patient on whom, slowly and by degrees, the agencies
of mesmerism are brought to bear, he acknowledged to
his heart the growing force of that vast and universal
magnetism which is the life of creation, and binds the
atom to the whole. A strange and inelfable consciousness
of power, of the SOMETHING GREAT within the perishable
clay, appealed to feelings at once dim and glorious—like
the faint recognitions of a holier and former being. An
impulse, that he could not resist, led him to seek the
mystic. He would demand, that hour, his initiation. into
the worlds beyond our world—he was prepared to breathe
a diviner air. He entered the castle, and strode the
shadowy and star-lit gallery which conducted to Mejnour’s
apartment.

THE rooms that Mejnour occupied consisted of two
chambers communicating with each other, and a third in
which he slept. All these rooms were placed in the huge
square tower that beetled over the dark and bush-grown
precipice. The ﬁrst chamber which Glyndon entered was
empty. With a noiseless step he passed on, and opened

the door that admitted into the inner one. He drew back
at the threshold, overpowered by a strong fragrance which
ﬁlled the chamber : a kind of mist thickened the air, rather
than obscured it, for this vapor was not dark, but resembled
a snow-cloud moving slowly, and in heavy undulations,
wave upon wave, regularly over the space. A mortal
cold struck to the Englishman’s heart, and his blood froze.
He stood rooted to the spot; and, as his eyes strained
involuntarily through the vapor, he fancied (for he could
not be sure that it was not the trick of his imagination)
that he saw dim, spectre-like, but gigantic forms ﬂoating
through the mist; or was it not rather the mist itself that
formed its vapors fantastically into those moving, impal-
pable, and bodiless apparitions? A great painter of
antiquity is said, in a picture of Hades, to have repre-
sented the monsters, that glide through the ghostly River
of the Dead, so artfully, that the eye perceived at once
that the river itself was but a spectre, and the bloodless
things that tenanted it had no life, their forms blending
with the dead waters till, as the eye continued to gaze, it '
ceased to discern them from the preternatural element
they were supposed to inhabit. Such were the moving
outlines that coiled and ﬂ0ated through the mist; but
before Glyndon had even drawn breath in this atmosphere
-for his life itself seemed arrested or changed into a
kind of horrid trance—he felt his hand seized, and he
was led from that room into the outer one. He heard
the door close—his blood rushed again through his veins,
and he saw Mejnour by his side. Strong convulsions then

suddenly seized his whole frame—he fell to the ground
insensible. When he recovered, he found himself in the
open air, in a rude balcony of stone that jutted from the
chamber ; the stars shining serenely over the dark abyss
below, and resting calmly upon the face of the mystic,
who stood beside him with folded arms.
“ Young man,” said Mejnour, “judge by what you have
just felt, how dangerous it is to seek knowledge until
prepared to receive it. Another moment in the air of
that chamber, and you had been a corpse.”
“Then of what nature was the knowledge that you,

icy atmosphere, which it was death for me to breathe?
-—Mejnour,” continued Glyndon, and his wild desire,
sharpened by the very danger he had passed, once more
animated and nerved him ; “ I am prepared at least for
the ﬁrst steps. I come to you as, of old, the pupil to the
Hierophant, and demand the initiation.”
Mejnour passed his hand over the young man’s heart
—it beat loud, regularly, and boldly. He looked at him
with something almost like admiration in his passionless
and frigid features, and muttered, half to himself—“Sure-
ly, in so much courage the true disciple is found at last. ”
Then, speaking aloud, he added —“ Be it so; man’s ﬁrst
initiation is in TRANCE. In dreams commences all human
knowledge; in dreams hovers over measureless space the
ﬁrst faint bridge between spirit and spirit—this world
and the worlds beyond! Look steadfastly on yonder
star 1 ”

Glyndon obeyed, and Mejnour retired into the cham-
ber; from which there then slowly emerged a vapor,
somewhat paler and of fainter odor than that which had
nearly produced so fatal an effect on his frame. This, on
the contrary, as it coiled around him, and then melted in
thin spires into the air, breathed a refreshing and healthful
fragrance. He still kept his eyes on the star, and the
star seemed gradually to ﬁx and command his gaze. A
sort of languor next seized his frame, but without, as he
thought, communicating itself to the mind; and as this
crept over him, he felt his temples sprinkled with some
volatile and ﬁery essence. At the same moment a slight
tremor shook his limbs, and thrilled through his veins.
The languor increased; still he kept his gaze upon the
star; and now its luminous circumference seemed to expand
and dilate. It became gradually softer and clearer in its
light; spreading wider and broader, it diﬂ'nsed all space
~all space seemed swallowed up in it. And at last, in
the midst of a silver shining atmosphere, he felt as if
something burst within his brain—as if a strong chain
Were broken; and at that moment a sense of heavenly
liberty, of unutterable delight, of freedom from the body,
of bird-like lightness, seemed to ﬂoat him into the space
itself. “Whom now upon earth dost thou wish to see ? ”
whispered the voice of Mejnour. “Viola and Zanoni l”
answered Glyndon, in his heart; but he felt that his lips
moved not. Suddenly at that thought—through this
space, in which nothing save one mellow translucent light
had been discernible,—a swift succession of shadowy

landscapes seemed to roll : trees, mountains, cities, seas‘
glided along, like the changes of a phantasmagoria; and
at last, settled and stationary, he saw a cave by the grad-
ual marge of an ocean shore—myrtles and orange_trces
clothing the gentle banks. On a height, at a distance,
gleamed the white but shattered relics of some ruined
heathen ediﬁce; and the moon, in calm splendor, shining
over all, literally bathed with its light two forms without
the cave, at whose feet the blue waters crept, and he
thought that he even heard them murmur. He recognized
both the ﬁgures. Zanoni was seated on a fragment of
stone; Viola, half-reclining by his side, was looking into
his face, which was bent down to her, and in her counte-
nance was the expression of that perfect happiness which
belongs to perfect love. “ Wouldst thou hear them speak ? ”
whispered Mejnour; and again, without sound, Glyndon
inly answered, “Yes!” Their voices then came to his
ear, but in tones that seemed to him strange; so subdued
were they, and sounding, as it were, so far off, that they
were as voices heard in the visions of some holier men,
from a distant sphere.
.“And how is it,” said Viola, “that thoucanst ﬁnd
pleasure in listening to the ignorant?”
“Because the heart is never ignorant; because the
mysteries of the feelings are as full of wonder as those
of the intellect. If at times thou canst not comprehend
the language of my thoughts, at times, also, I hear sweet
enigmas in that of thy emotions.”
“Ah, say not sol” said Viola, winding her arm ten-

face seemed lovelier for its blushes. “ For the enigmas

learned to watch for thy footstep When absent——yet even
in absence to see thee everywhere l—I dreamed not how
strong and all-pervading is the connection between nature
and the human soul! . . . . . .
“And yet,” she continued, “I am now assured of what
I at ﬁrst believed -—-that the feelings which attracted me
towards thee at ﬁrst were not those of love. I know that,
by comparing the Present with the Past,—it was a senti-
ment then wholly of the mind or the spiritl I could not
hear thee now say, ‘Viola, be happy with another I ’”
“And I could not now tell thee so 1 Ah, Viola 1 never
be weary of assuring me that thou art happy l”
“Happy, while thou'art so. Yet, at times, Zanoni,
thou art so sad!”
“ Because human life is so short; because we must part
at last; because you moon shines on when the nightingale
sings to it no more l A little while, and thine eyes will
grow dim, and thy beauty haggard, and these locks that
_I toy with now will be grey and loveless.”
“And then, cruel onel” said Viola, tone-hingly, “I
shall never see the signs of age in thee! But shall we
not grow old together, and our eyes be accustomed to a '
change which the heart shall not share!”
Zanoni sighed 1 He turned away, and seemed to com-
mune with himself.

Glyndon’s attention grew yet more earnest.
“But were it so,” muttered Zanoni ;- and then looking
steadfastly at Viola, he said, with a half-smile, “Hast
thou no curiosity to learn more of the Lover thou once
couldst believe the agent of the Evil One ?”
“ None; all that one wishes to know of the beloved
one, I know,—that thou lovest me!”
“I have told thee that my life is apart from others.
Wouldst thou not seek to share it ?”
“I share it now !”
“But were it possible to be thus young and fair for
ever, til! the world blazes round us as one funeral pyre !”
“We shall be so when we leave the world ! ”
Zanoni was mute for some moments, and at length he
said—
“ Canst thou recall those brilliant and aerial dreams
which once visited thee, when thou didst fancy that thou
wert pre-ordained to some fate aloof and afar from the
common children of the earth?”
“Zanoni, the fate is found.”
“And hast thou no terror of the future?”
“The future! I forget it! Time past, and present,
and to come, reposes in my smile. Ah! Zanoni, play
not with the foolish credulities of my youth! I have
been better and humbler since thy presence has dispelled
'the mist of the air. The Future!—well, when I have
cause to dread it, I will look up to heaven ; and remember
who guides our fate!”

As she lifted her eyes above, a dark cloud swept sud-
denly over the scene. It wrapt the orange-trees, the
azure ocean, the dense sands; but still the last images
that it veiled from the charmed eyes of Glyndon were The
forms of Viola and Zanoni. The face of the one rapt,
serene, and radiant; the face of the other, dark, thoughtful,
and locked in more than its usual rigidness of melancholy
beauty and profound repose.
“Rouse thyself,” said Mejnour, “thy ordeal has com-
menced! There are pretenders to the solemn science,
who could have shown thee the absent; and prated to
thee, in their charlatanic jargon, of the secret electricities
and the magnetic ﬂuid, of whose true properties they
know but the germs and elements. I will lend thee the
books of those glorious dupes, and thou wilt ﬁnd, in the
dark ages, how many erring steps have stumbled upon
the threshold of the mighty learning, and fancied they
had pierced the temple. Hermes, and Albert, and Para-

it is ﬁt that we who endeavor to rise to an elevation so sublime,
should study ﬁrst to leave behind carnal affections, the frailty of
the senses, the passions that belong to matter; secondly, to learn
by what means we may ascend to the climax of pure intellect,
united with the powers above, without which never can we gain
the lore of secret things, nor the magic that effects true wonders.

I'r wanted still many minutes of midnight, and Glyndon
was once more in the apartment of the mystic. He had
rigidly observed the fast ordained to him; and in the
rapt and intense reveries into which his excited fancy had
plunged him, he was not only insensible to the wants of
the ﬂesh—he felt above them.
Mejnour, seated beside his disciple, thus addressed
him : —
> “ Man is arrogant in proportion to his ignorance. Man’s
natural tendency is to egotism. Man in his infancy of
knowledge, thinks that all creation was formed for him.
For several ages he saw in the countless worlds, that
sparkle through space like the bubbles of a shoreless
ocean, only the petty candles, the household torches, that
Providence had been pleased to light for no other purpose
but to make the night more agreeable to man. Astronomy
has corrected this delusion of human vanity: and man
now reluctantly confesses that the stars are worlds larger
and more glorious than his own,-that the earth on which

he crawls is a scarce visible speck on the vast chart of
creation. But in the small as in the vast, God is equally
profuse of life. The traveller looks upon the tree, and
fancies its boughs were formed for his shelter in the sum-
mer sun, or his fuel in the winter frosts. But in each leaf
of these boughs the Creator has made a world ; it swarms
with innumerable races. Each drop of the water in you
moat is an orb more populous than a kingdom is of men.
Everywhere, then, in this immense Design, Science brings
new life to light. Life is the one pervading principle, and
even the thing that seems to die and putrefy, but engenders
new life, and changes to fresh forms of matter. Reasoning
then, by evident analogy —if not a leaf, if not a drop of
water, but is, no less than yonder star, a habitable and
breathing world—nay, if even man himself is a world to
other lives, and millions and myriads dwell in the rivers
of his blood, and inhabit man’s frame as man inhabits
earth, common sense (if your schoolmen had it) would
sufﬁce to teach that the circumfluent inﬁnite which you
call space—the boundless Impalpable which divides earth
from the moon and stars—is ﬁlled also with its corres-
pondent and appropriate life. Is it not a visible absurdity
to suppose that Being is crowded upon every leaf, and yet
absent from the immensities of space? The law of the
Great System forbids the waste even of an atom ; it knows
no spot where something of life does not breathe. In
the very charnel-house is the nursery of production and
animation. Is that true? Well, then, can you conceive
that space, which is the Inﬁnite itself, is alone a waste, is

alone lifeless, is less useful to the one design of universal
being than the dead carcass of a dog, than the peopled
.eaf, than the swarming globule? The microscope shows
you the creatures on the leaf; no mechanical tube is yet
invented to discover the nobler and more gifted things
that hover in the illimitable air. Yet between these last
and man is a mysterious and terrible aﬁinity. And hence,
by tales and legends, not wholly false nor wholly true,
have arisen from time to time, beliefs in apparitions and
spectres. If more common to the earlier and simpler
tribes than to the men of your duller age, it is but that,
with the ﬁrst, the senses are more keen and quick. And
as the savage can see or scent, miles away, the traces of
a foe, invisible to the gross sense of the civilized animal,
so the barrier itself between him and the creatures of the
airy world is less thickened and obscured. Do you listen ? ”
“With my soul I ”
“But ﬁrst, to penetrate this barrier, the soul with which
you listen must be sharpened by intense enthusiasm, puri-
ﬁed from all earthlier desires. Not without reason have
the so-styled magicians, in all lands and times, insisted
on chastity and abstemious reverie as the communicauts
of inspiration. When thus prepared, science can be
brought to aid it; the sight itself may be rendered more
subtle, the nerves more acute, the spirit more alive and
outward, and the element itself -—the air, the space —
may be made, by certain secrets of the higher chemistry,‘
more palpable and clear. And this, too, is not magic,
as the credulous call it; — as I have so often said before,

magic (or science that violates Nature) exists not ; _it is
but the science by which Nature can be controlled. Now,
in space there are millions of beings, not literally spiritual,
for they have all, like the animalculee unseen by the naked
eye, certain forms of matter, though matter so delicate,
air-drawn, and subtle, that it is, as it were, but a ﬁlm, a
, gossamer that clothes the spirit. Hence the Rosicrucian’s
lovely phantoms of sylph and gnome. Yet, in truth, these
races and tribes differ more widely, each from each, than
the Calmuck from the Greek—diﬂ‘er in attributes and
powers. In the drop of water you see how the animalcuhe
vary, how vast and terrible are some of those monster
mites as compared with others. Equally so with the In-
habitants of the atmosphere: some of surpassing wisdom,
some of horrible malignity; some hostile as ﬁends to men,
others gentle as messengers between earth and heaven
He who would establish intercourse with these varying
beings, resembles the traveller who would penetrate into
unknovm lands. He is exposed to strange dangers and
unconjectured terrors. That intercourse once gained, 1
cannot secure thee from the chances to which thy journey
is exposed. I cannot direct thee to paths free from the
wanderings of the deadliest foes. Thou must alone, and
of thyself, face and hazard all. But if thou art so enamored
of life, as to care only to live on, no matter for what ends,
recruiting the nerves and veins with the alchemist’s vivi-
fying elixir, why seek these dangers from the intermediate
tribes? Because the very elixir that pours a more glorious
life into the frame, so sharpens the senses that those larvae

i of the air become to thee audible and apparent; so that,
unless trained by degrees to endure the phantoms and
subdue their malice, a life thus gifted would be the most
awful doom man could bring upon himself. Hence it is,
that though the elixir be compounded of the simplest
herbs, his frame only is prepared to receive it who has
gone through the subtlest trials. Nay, some, scared and
daunted into the most intolerable horror by the sights that
burst upon their eyes at the ﬁrst draught, have found the
potion- less powerful to save than the agony and travail
of Nature to destroy. To the unprepared, the elixir is
thus but the deadliest poison. Amidst the dwellers of
the threshold is ONE, too, surpassing in maliguity and
hatred all her tribe --one whose eyes have paralyzed the
bravest, and whose power increases over the spirit pre-
cisely in proportion to its fear. Does thy courage falter f”
“ Nay; thy words but kindle it.”
“ Follow me, then ; and submit to the initiatory labors.”
With that, Mejnour led him into the interior chamber,
and proceeded to explain to him certain chemical opera-
tions, which, though extremely simple in themselves,
Glyndon soon perceived were capable of very extraor-
dinary results.
“ In the remoter times,” said Mejnour, smiling, “ our
brotherhood were often compelled to recur to delusions
to protect realities; and, as dexterous mechanicians or
expert chemists, they obtained the name of sorcerers.
Observe how easy to construct is the Spectre Lion that
attended the renowned Leonardo da Vinci l”

And Glyndon beheld with delighted surprise the simple
means by which the wildest cheats of the imagination can
be formed. The magical landscapes in which Baptista
Porta rejoiced ; the apparent change of the seasons with
which Albertus Magnus startled the earl of Holland; nay,
even those more dread delusions of the Ghost and Image
with which the Necromancers of Heraclea woke the con-
science of the conqueror of Platzea *—- all these, as the
showman enchants some trembling children on a Christmas
Eve, with his lantern and phantasmagoria, Mejnour ex-
hibited to his pupil.

“And now laugh for ever at magic! when these, the
very tricks, the very sports and frivolities of science, were
the very acts which men viewed with abhorrence; and
Inquisitors and Kings rewarded with the rack and the
stake.”
“ But the Alchemist’s transmutation of metals ”

“Nature herself is a laboratory in which metals, and
all elements, are for ever at change. Easy to make gold,
—easier, and more commodious, and cheaper still, to make
the pearl, the diamond, and the ruby. Oh, yes; wise
men found sorcery in this, too; but they found no sorcery
in the discovery, that by the simplest combination of things
of everyday use they could raise a devil that would sweep
away thousands of their kind by the breath of consuming
ﬁre. Discover what will destroy life, and you are a great
‘man 1—- what will prolong it, and you are an impostor!

this world to itself. And now that you have seen some
few of the eﬁ'ects of science, begin to learn its grammar.”
Mejnour then set before his pupil certain tasks, in which
the rest of the night wore itself away.

Fox a considerable period the pupil of Mejnour was
now absorbed in labor dependent on the most vigilant
attention, on the most minute and subtle calculation.
Results astonishing and various rewarded his toils and
stimulated his interest. Nor were these studies limited
to chemical discovery—in which it is permitted me to
say that the greatest marvels upon the organization of
physical life seemed wrought by experiments of the vivi-

fying inﬂuence of Heat. Mejnour professed to ﬁnd a link
between all intellectual beings in the existence of a certain
all-pervading and invisible ﬂuid resembling electricity,
yet distinct from the known operations of that mysterious
agency— a ﬂuid that connected thought to thought with
the rapidity and precision of the modern telegraph, and
the inﬂuence of this inﬂuence, according to Mejnour,
extended to the remotest past—that is to say, whenever
and wheresoever man had thought. Thus, if the doctrine
were true, all human knowledge became attainable through
a medium established between the brain of the individual
inquirer and all the farthest and obscurest regions in the
universe of ideas. Glyndon was surprised to ﬁnd Mejnour
attached to the abstruse mysteries which the Pythagoreans
ascribed to the occult science of NUMBERS. ‘ In this last,
new lights glimmered dimly on his eyes; and he began
to perceive that even the power to predict, or rather (to

But he observed that the last brief process by which, in
each of these experiments, the wonder was achieved,
Mejnour reserved for himself, and refused to communicate
the secret. The answer he obtained to his remonstrances
on this head was more stern than satisfactory: —
“Dost thou think,” said Mejnour, “ that I would give
to the mere pupil, whose qualities are not yet tried, powers
that might change the face of the social world? The last
secrets are intrusted only to him of whose virtue the Master

is convinced. Patience! It is labor itself that is the
great puriﬁer of the mind ; and by degrees the secrets will
grow upon thyself as thy mind becomes riper to receive
them.”
At last, Mejnour professed himself satisﬁed with the
progress made by his pupil. “The hour now arrives,”
he said, “when thou mayst pass the great but airy barrier,
—when thou mayst gradually confront the terrible Dweller
of the Threshold. Continue thy labors—continue to
suppress thine impatience for results until thou canst
fathom the causes. I leave thee for one month; if, at the
end of that period, when I return, the tasks set thee are
completed, and thy mind prepared by contemplation and
austere thought for the ordeal, I promise thee the ordeal
shall commence. One caution alone I give thee: regard
it as a peremptory command _—Enter not this chamber l”
(They were then standing in the room where their exper-
iments had been chieﬂy made, and in which Glyndon, on
the night he had sought the solitude of the Mystic, had
nearly fallen a victim to his intrusion.)
“Enter not this chamber till my return ; or, above all,
if by any search for materials necessary to thy toils, thou
shouldst venture hither, forbear to light the naphtha in
those vessels, and to open the vases on yonder shelves.
I leave the key of the room in thy keeping, in order to
try thy abstinence and self-control. Young man, this
very temptation is a part of thy trial."
With that, Mejnour placed the key in his hands ; and at
sunset he left the castle. '

'
For several days Glyndon continued immersed in em-
ployments which strained to the utmost all the faculties
of his intellect. Even the most partial success depended
so entirely on the abstraction of the mind, and the minute-
ncss of its calculations, that there was scarcely room for
any other thought than those absorbed in the occupation.
And doubtless this perpetual strain of the faculties was
the object of Mejnour in works that did not seem exactly
pertinent to the purposes in view. As the study of the
elementary mathematics, for example, is not so proﬁtable
in the solving of problems, unless in our after-callings, as
it is serviceable in training the intellect to the compre-
hension and analysis of general truths,
But in less than half the time which Mejnour had stated
for the duration of his absence, all that the Mystic had
appointed to his toils was completed by the pupil; and
then his mind, thus relieved from the drudgery and me-
)ehanism of employment, once more sought occupation in
dim conjecture and restless fancies. His inquisitive and
rash nature grew excited by the prohibition of Mejnour,
and he found himself gazing too often, with perturbed
and daring curiosity, upon the key of the forbidden cham-
ber. He began to feel indignant at a trial of constancy
which he deemed frivolous and puerile. What nursery
tales of Bluebeard and his closet were revived to daunt
and terrify him 1 How could the mere walls of a chamber,
in which he had so often securely pursued his labors, start
into living danger ? If haunted, it could be but by those
delusions which Mejnour had taught him to despise. A

shadowy lion—a chemical phantasm! Tush! he lost
half his awe of Mejnour, when he thought that by such
tricks the sage could practise upon the very intellect he
had awakened and instructed ! Still he resisted the im-
pulses of his curiosity and his pride, and, to escape from
their dictation, he took long rambles on the hills or amidst
the valleys that surrounded the castle ; - seeking by bodily
fatigue to subdue the unreposing mind; One day sud-
denly emerging from a dark ravine, he came upon one of
those Italian scenes of rural festivity and mirth in which
the classic age appears to revive. It was a festival, partly
agricultural, partly religious, held yearly by the peasants
of that district. Assembled at the outskirts of a village,
animated crowds, just returned from a procession to a
neighboring chapel, were now forming themselves into
groups --the old to taste the vintage, the young to dance
—all to be gay and happy. This sudden picture of easy
joy, and careless ignorance, contrasting so forcibly with
the intense studies and that parching desire for wisdom
which had so long made up his own life, and burned at
his own heart, sensibly affected Glyndon. As he stood
aloof and gazing on'them, the young man felt once more
that he was young! The memory of all he had been
content to sacriﬁce spoke to him like the, sharp voice of
remorse. The ﬂitting forms of the women in their pictur-
esque attire, their happy laughter ringing through the
cool, still air of the autumn noOn, brought back to the
heart, or rather perhaps to the senses, the images of his

past time, the “golden shepherd hours,” when to live was
but to enjoy.
He approached nearer to the scene, and suddenly a
noisy group swept round him; and Maestro Paola, tap-
ping him familiarly on the shoulder, exclaimed, in a hearty
voice, “ Welcome, Excellency !— we are rejoiced to see
you amongst us.” Glyndon was about to reply to this
salutation, when'his eyes rested upon the face of a young
girl leaning on Paolo’s arm, of a beauty so attractive, that
his color rose and his heart beat as he encountered her
gaze. Her eyes sparkled with a roguish and petulant
mirth, her parted lips showed teeth like pearls,--as if im-
patient at the pause of her companion from the revel of
the rest, her little foot beat the ground to a measure that
she half-bummed, half-chanted. Paolo laughed as he saw
the effect the girl had produced upon the young foreigner.
“Will you not dance, Excellency? Come, lay aside
your greatness, and be merry, like us poor devils. See
how our pretty Fillide is longing for a partner. Take
compassion on her.”
Fillide pouted at this speech ; and disengaging her arm
from Paolo’s, turned away, but threw over her shoulder
a glance half inviting, half defying. Glyndon, almost
involuntarily, advanced to her, and addressed her.
Oh' yes, he addresses her 1 She looks down, and smiles.
Paolo leaves them to themselves, sauntering. off with a
devil-me-carish air. Fillide speaks now, and looks up at
the scholar’s face with arch invitation. He shakes his
head ; Fillide laughs, and her laugh is silvery. She

points to a gay mountaineer, who is tripping up to her
merrily. Why does Glyndon feel jealous? Why, when
she speaks again, does he shake his head no more? He
offers his hand ; Fillide blushes, and takes it with a demure
eoquetry. What ! is it so, indeed ! They whirl into the
noisy circle of the revellers. Ha! ha ! is not this better
than distilling herbs, and breaking thy brains on Pytha-
gorean numbers? How lightly Fillide bounds along I
How her lithesome waist supples itself to thy circling
arm! Tara-ra-tara, ta-tara, rara-ra ! What the devil is
in the measure, that it makes the blood course like quick-
silver through the veins? Was there ever a pair of eyes
' like Fillide’s ? Nothing of the cold stars there l Yet how
they twinkle and laugh atgthee! And that rosy, pursed-
up mouth, that will answer so sparingly to thy ﬂatteries,

“Always young l” Glyndon started, as he turned his
gaze from the fresh fair rosy face of the girl, and saw the
eyes dropping rheum-the yellow wrinkled skin—the
tottering frame of the old man.

him, and with a malicious laugh. “Yet I, too, was

IT was that grey, indistinct, struggling interval between
the night and the dawn, when Clarence stood once more
in his chamber. The abstruse calculations lying on his
table caught his eye, and ﬁlled him with a sentiment of
weariness and distaste. But—“Alas, if we could be

the Neophyte now)—not to labor for ever at these crabbed
ﬁgures and these cold compounds of herbs and drugs.
No; but to enjoy, to love, to revel! What should be
the companions of youth but pleasure?—And the gift
of eternal youth may be mine this very hourl What
means this prohibition of Mejnour’s? Is it not of the
same complexion as his ungenerous reserve even in the
minutest secrets of chemistry, or the numbers of his
Cabalaf—compelling me to perform all the toils, and
yet withholding from me the knowledge of the crowning
result? No doubt he will, on his return, show me that
the great mystery can be attained; but will still forbid me
to attain it. Isit not as if he desired to keep my youth the
slave to his age ? --to make me dependent solely on him-
self?--to bind me to a journeyman’s service by perpetual
excitement to curiosity, and the sight of the fruits he
places beyond my lips?” These, and many reﬂections
still more rcpining, disturbed and irritated him. Heated
with wine—excited by'the wild revels he had left—he
was unable to sleep. The image of that revolting Old
Age which Time, unless defeated, must bring upon him-
self, quickened the eagerness of his desire for the dazzling
and imperishable Youth he ascribed to Zanoni. The
prohibition only served to create a spirit of deﬁance.
The reviving day, laughing jocjundly through his lattice,
dispelled all the fears and superstitions that belong to
night. The mystic chamber presented to his imagination
nothing to differ from any other apartment in the castle.
What foul or malignant apparition could harm him in the

light of that blessed sun! It was the peculiar, and on
the whole most unhappy, contradiction in Glyndon’s na-
ture, that while his reasonings led him to doubt—and
doubt rendered him in moral conduct irresolute and un-
steady—he was physically brave to rashness. Nor is
i this uncommon: skepticism and presumption are often
twins. When a man of this character determines on any
action, personal fear never deters him; and for the moral
fear, any sophistry sufﬁces to self-will. Almost without
analyzing himself the mental process by which his nerves
hardened themselves and his limbs moved, he traversed
the corridor, gained Mejnour’s apartment, and opened the
forbidden door. All was as he had been accostomed to
see it, save that on a table in the centre of the room lay
open a large volume. He approached, and gazed on the
characters on the page; they were in a cipher, the study
of which had made a part of his labors. With but slight
difﬁculty be imagined that be interpreted the meaning of
the ﬁrst sentences, and that they ran thus : —
“ To quaﬂ' the inner life, is to see the outer life: to live
in deﬁance of time, is to live in the whole. He who dis-
covers the elixir, discovers what lies in space; for the
spirit that viviﬁes the frame strengthens the senses.
There is attraction in the elementary principle of light.
In the lamps of Rosicrncius, the ﬁre is the pure elemen-
tary principle. Kindle the lamps while thou openest the
vessel that contains the elixir. and the light attracts to-
wards thee those beings whose life is that light. Beware
of Fear. Fear is the deadliest enemy to Knowledge.”
\

80 znuonr.
Here the ciphers changed their character, and became
incomprehensible. But had he not read enough? Did
not the last sentence suﬂice?—“Beware of Fearl” It
was as if Mejnour had purposely left the page open—as
if the trial was, in truth, the reverse of the one pretended
_as if the Mystic had designed to make experiment of
his courage while affecting but that of his forbearance.
Not Boldness, but Fear, was the deadliest enemy to
Knowledge. He moved to the shelves on which the
crystal vases were placed; with an untrembling hand he
took from one of them the stopper, and a delicious odor
suddenly diﬁ'used itself through the room. The air
sparkled as if with a diamond dust. A sense of unearth-
ly delight-of an existence that seemed all spirit, ﬂashed
through his whole frame; and a faint, low; but exquisite
music crept, thrilling, through the chamber. At this
moment he heard a voice in the corridor, calling on his
name; and presently there was a knock on the door
without. “Are you there, Signor ? ” said the clear tones
of Maestro Paolo. Glyndon hastily reclosed and re-
placed the vial; and bidding Paolo await him in his own
apartment, tarried till he heard the intruder’s steps de-
part; he then reluctantly quitted the room. As be locked
the door, he still heard the dying strain of that fairy mu-
sic; and with a light step, and a joyous heart, he repair-
ed to Paolo, inly resolving to visit again the chamber at
an hour when his experiment would be safe from inter-
ruption. '
As he crossed his threshold. Paolo started back, and

exclaimed, “ Why, Excellency l I scarcely recognize you !
Amusement I see is a great beautiﬁer to the young.
Yesterday you looked so pale and haggard ; but Fillide’s
merry eyes have done more for you than the philosopher’s
stone (Saints, forgive me for naming it) ever did for the
wizards.” And Glyndon, glancing at the old Venetian
mirror, as Paolo spoke, was scarcely less startled than
Paolo himself at the change in his own mien and bearing.
His form, before bent with thought, seemed to him taller
by half the head, so lithesome and erect rose his slender
stature; his eyes glowed, his cheeks bloomed with health
and the innate and pervading pleasure. If the mere
fragrance of the elixir was thus potent, well might the
_ alchemists have ascribed life and youth to the draught!
“ You must forgive me, Excellency, for disturbing you,”
said Paolo, producing a letter from his pouch; “but our
Patron has just written to me to say that he will be here
to-morrow, and desired me to lose not amoment in giving
to yourself this billet, which he inclosed.”
“Who brought the letter?”
“A horseman, who did not wait for any reply.”
Glyndon opened the letter, and read as follows:—
“I return a week sooner than I had intended, and you
will expect me to-morrow. You will then enter on the
ordeal you desire; but remember that, in doing so, you
must reduce Being as far as possible into Mind. The
senses must be mortiﬁed and subdued --not the whisper
of one passion heard. Thou mavst be master of the Ga-

bala and the Chemistry; but thou must be master also
over the Flesh and the Blood— over Love and Vanity,
Ambition and Hate. I will trust to ﬁnd thee so. Fast
and meditate till we meet!”
Glyndon crumpled the letter in his hand with a smile
of disdain. What! more drudgery—more abstinence!
Youth without love and pleasure! Ha, ha! baﬁied Mej-
nour, thy pupil shall gain thy secrets without thine aid l
“And Fillidel I passed her cottage in my way- she
blushed and sighed when I jested her about you, Excel-
lency l ”
“ Well, Paolo ! I thank thee for so charming an intro-
duction. Thine must be a rare life.”
“Ah, Excellency, while we are young, nothing like
adventure — except love, wine, and laughter ! ”
“Very true. Farewell, Maestro Paolo; we will talk
more with each other in a few days.”
All that morning Glyndon was almost overpowered
with the new sentiment of happiness that had entered into
him. He roamed into the woods, and he felt a pleasure
that resembled his earlier life of an artist, but a pleasure
yet more subtle and vivid, in the various colors of the
autumn foliage. Certainly, Nature seemed to be brought
closer to him; he comprehended better all that Mejnour
had often preached to him of the mystery of sympathies
and attractions. He was about to enter into the same
law as those mute children of the forests! He was to
know the renewal of life; the seasons that chilled £0

winter should yet bring again the bloom and the mirth of
spring. Man’s common existence is as one year to the
vegetable world : he has his spring, his summer, his autumn,
and winter—but only. once. But the giant oaks round
him go through a revolving series of verdure and youth,
and the green of the centenarian is as vivid in the beams
of May as that of the sapling by its side. “Mine shall
be your spring, but not y0ur winter 1” exclaimed the as-
pirant.
Wrapt in these sanguine and joyous reveries, Glyndon,
quitting the woods, found himself amidst cultivated ﬁelds
and vineyards to which his footstep had not before wan-
dered : and there stood, by the skirts of a green lane that
reminded him of verdant England, a modest house-half
cottage half farm. The door was open, and he saw a girl at
work with her distaﬂ'. She looked up, uttered a slight cry,
and, tripping gaily into the lane to his side, he recognized
the dark-eyed Fillide.
“ Hist l ” she said, archly putting her ﬁnger to her lip;
“do not speak loud — my mother is asleep within ; and I
knew you would come to see me. It is kind l”
Glyndon with a little embarrassment, accepted the com-
pliment to his kindness, which he did not exactly deserve.
“ You have thought, then, of me, fair Fillide ? ”
“ Yes,” answered the girl, coloring, but with that frank,
bold ingenuousness which characterizes the females of
Italy, especially of the lower class, and in the southern
provinces —“ Oh, yes! I have thought of little else
Paolo said he knew you would visit me.”

"And what relation is Paolo to you?"
“ None: but a good friend to us all. My brother is
one of his band.”
“One of hisband l --A robber?”
“ We, of the mountains, do not call a mountaineer ‘ a
robber,’ signor.”
“I ask pardon. Do you not tremble sometimes for
your brother’s life Y The law ”

“ Law never ventures into these deﬁles. . Tremble for
him! No. My father and grandsire were of the same
calling. I often wish I were a man l”
“By these lips, I am enchanted that your wish cannot
re realized.”
“ Fie, signor! And do you really love me ?”
“With my whole heart!”
“And I thee ! ” said the girl, with a candor that seemed
innocent, as she suffered him to clasp her hand.
“But,” she added, “thou wilt soon leave us: and I
” She stopped short, and the tears stood in her eyes.
There was something dangerous in this, it must be con-
fessed. Certainly Fillide had not the seraphic loveliness
of Viola; but hers was a beauty that equally, at least,
touched, the senses. Perhaps Glyndon had never really
loved Viola; perhaps the feelings with which she had in-
spired him were not of that ardent character which deserves
the name oflove. However that be, he thought, as he gazed
on those dark eyes, that he had never loved before.
“And couldst thou not leave thy mountains? ” he whis-
pered, as he drew yet nearer to her

“ Dost thou ask me ?” she said, retreating, and looking
him steadfastly in the face. “ Dost thou know what we
daughters of the mountains are ? You say, smooth cava-
liers of cities seldom mean what you speak. With you,
love is amusement; with us, itis life. Leave these moun-
tainsl Well! I should not leave my nature.”
“Keep thy nature ever—it is a sweet one.”
“Yes, sweet while thou art true; stern if thou art
faithless. Shall I tell thee what I—what the girls of
this country, are? Daughters of men, whom you call
robbers, we aspire to be the companions of our lovers or
our husbands. We love ardently, we own it boldly. We
stand by your side in danger; we serve you as slaves in
safety: we never change, and we resent change. You
may reproach, strike us, trample us as a dog,— we bear
all without a murmur; betray us, and no tiger is more
relentless. Be true, and our hearts reward you; be false,
and our hands revenge l -- Dost thou love me now ?”
During this speech, the Italian’s countenance had most
eloquently aided her words— by turns soft, frank, ﬁerce,
-_ and, at the last question, she inclined her head humbly,
and stood, as in fear of his reply, before him. The stern,
brave, wild spirit, in which what seemed unfeminine was
yet, if I may so say, still womanly, did not recoil, it rather
captivated Glyndon. He answered readily, brieﬂy, and
freely—“ Fillide — yes I ”

Mejnour, do you leave your pupil of four-and‘twenty to
the mercy of these wild cats-a-mountain! Preach fast,
and abstinence, the sublime renunciation of the cheats of
the senses! Very well in you, sir, Heaven knows how
many ages old ! but at four-and-twenty, your Hierophant
would have kept you out of Fillide’s way, or you would
have had small taste for the Cabala!
And so they stood, and talked, and vowed, and wliis~
pered, till the girl’s mother made some noise within the
house, and Fillide bounded back to the distaﬁ‘, her ﬁnger
once more on her lip. \
“There is more magic in Fillide than in Mejnour,” said
Glyndon to himself, walking gaily home; “yet, on second
thoughts, I know not if I quite so well like a character
so ready for revenge! But he who has the real secret
can baﬁle even the vengeance of a woman, and disarm all
danger!”
Sirrah ! dost thou even already meditate the possibility
I; of treason? Oh, well said Zanoni, “to pour pure water

AND it is profound night. All is at rest within the old
castle—all is breathless under the melancholy stars. Now
is the time. Mejnour with his austere wisdom—Mejnour,
the enemy to love—Mejnour, whose eye will read thy

still lay there opened; he turned over the leaves, but
could not decipher their meaning, till he came to the
following passage:—

repeated inhalations have accustomed the frame gradually
to the ecstatic liquid, is to know not life, but death.”
He could penetrate no farther into the instructions;
the cipher again changed. He now looked steadily and
earnestly round the chamber. The moon-light came
quietly through the lattice as his hand opened it, and
seemed, as it rested on the ﬂoor and ﬁlled the walls, like
the presence of some ghostly and mournful Power. He
ranged the mystic lamps (nine in number) round the cen-
tre of the room, and lighted them one by one. A ﬂame
of silvery and azure tints sprung up from each, and lighted
the apartment with a calm and yet most dazzling splendor
but presently this light grew more soft and dim, as a thin
grey cloud, like a mist, gradually spread over the room;
and an icy thrill shot through the heart of the English-
man, and quickly gathered over him like the coldness of
death. Instinctively aware of his danger, he tottered,
though with difﬁculty, for his limbs seemed rigid and
stone-like, to the shelf that contained the crystal vials;
hastily he inhaled the spirit, and laved his temples with
the sparkling liquid. The same sensation of vigor and
youth, and joy, and airy lightness, that he had felt in the
morning, instantaneously replaced the deadly numbness
thatjust before had invaded the citadel of life. He stood,
with his arms folded on his bosom, erect and dauntless,
to watch what should ensue.
The vapor had now assumed almost the thickness and
seeming consistency of a snow-cloud; the lamps piercing
it like stars. And now he distinctly saw shapes, somewhat

resembling in outline those of the human form, gliding
slowly and with regular evolutions through the cloud.
They appeared bloodless; their bodies were transparent,
and contracted or expanded, like the folds of a serpent.
As they moved in majestic order, he heard a low sound—
the ghost, as it were, of voice —-which each caught and
echoed from the other ; a low sound, but musical, which
seemed the chant of some unspeakably tranquil joy. None
of these apparitions heeded him. His intense longing to
accost them, to be of them, to inake one of this movement
of aerial happiness—for such it seemed to him—made him
stretch forth his arms and seek to cry aloud, but only an
inarticulate whisper passed his lips; and the movement
and the music went on the same as if the mortal were not
there. Slowly they glided round and aloft, till, in the
same majestic order, one after one, they ﬂoated through
the casement and were lost in the moonlight; then, as his
eyes followed them, the casement became darkened with
some object undistinguishable at the ﬁrst gaze, but which
sufﬁced mysteriously to change into ineﬁ‘able horror the
delight he had before experienced. By degrees, this ob-
ject shaped itself to his sight. It was as that of a human
head, covered with a dark veil, through which glared with
livid and demoniao ﬁre, eyes that froze the marrow of his
bones. Nothing else of the face was distinguishable—
nothing but those intolerable eyes; but his terror, that
even at the ﬁrst seemed beyond nature to endure, was in-
creased a thousand-fold, when, after a pause, the phantom
glided slowly into the chamber. The cloud retreated from

it as it advanced; the bright lamps grew wan, and ﬂick-
ered restlessly as at the breath of its presence. Its form
was veiled as the face, but the outline was that of a female ;
yet it moved not as move even the ghosts that simulate
the living. It seemed rather to crawl as some vast mis-
shapen reptile; and pausing, at. length it cowered beside
the table which held the mystic volume, and again ﬁxed
its eyes through the ﬁlmy veil on the rash invoker. All
fancies, the most grotesque, of Monk or Painter in the
early North, would have failed to give to the visage of
, imp or ﬁend that aspect of deadly malignity which spoke
to the shuddering nature in those eyes alone. All else so
dark-shrouded—vciled and larva-like. But that burning
glare so intense, so livid, yet so living, had in it something
that was almost human, in its passion of hate and mockery
-something that served to show that the shadowy Horror
was not all a spirit, but partook of matter enough, at
least, to make it more deadly and fearful an enemy to
material forms. As, clinging with the grasp of agony to
the wall —his hair erect_- his eye-balls starting, he still
gazed back upon that appalling gaze—the Image spoke
to him—his soul rather than his ear comprehended the
words it said.
“Thou hast entered the immeasurable region. I am
the Dweller of the Threshold. What wouldst thou with
me? Silent? Dost thou fear me? Am I not thy beloved?
Is it not for me that thou hast rendered up the delights
of thy race ? Wouldst thou be wise ? Mine is the wisdom
of the countless ages. Kiss me, my mortal lover.” And

the Horror crawled near and nearer to him ; it crept to
his side, its breath breathed upon his cheek! With a
sharp cry he fell to the earth insensible, and knew no more
till, far in the noon of the next day, he opened his eyes
and found himself in his bed,— the glorious sun streaming
through his lattice, and the bandit Paolo by his side,
engaged in polishing his carbine, and whistling a Galabrian
love-air.

gleaming amidst groves of oranges and lemons ;—vineyarda
and olive-woods ﬁlling up the valleys, and clambering
along the hill-sides; and villa, farm, and cottage covered
with luxuriant trellises of dark-green leaves and purple
fruit. For, there, the prodigal beauty yet seems half to
justify those graceful superstitions of a creed that, too
enamoured of earth, rather brought the deities to man,
than raised the man to their less alluring and less volup-
tuous Olympus.
And still to the ﬁshermen, weaving yet their antique
dances on the sand—to the maiden adorning yet, with
many a silver ﬁbula, her glossy tresses under the tree that
overshadows her tranquil cot—the same Great Mother
that watched over the wise of Samos —-the democracy of
Corcyra — the graceful and deep-taught loveliness of
Miletus — smiles as graciously as of yore. For the North,
philosophy and freedom are essentials to human happiness.
In the lands which Aphrodite rose from the waves to
g0vern, as the Seasons, hand in hand, stood to welcome
her on the shores,* Nature is all-sufﬁcient.
The isle which Zanoni had selected was one of the love--
liest in that divine sea. His abode, at some distance from
the city, but near one of the creeks on the shore, belonged
to a Venetian, and though small, had more of elegance
than the natives ordinarily cared for. On the seas, and
in sight, rode his vessel. His Indians, as before, minis-
tered in mute gravity to the service of the household. No
spot could be more beautiful -no solitude less invaded-

To the mysterious knowledge of Zanoni —-— to the harmless
ignorance of Viola—the babbling and garish world of
civilized man was alike unheeded. The loving sky and
the lovely earth are companions enough to Wisdom and
to Ignorance while they love!
Although, as I have before said, there was nothing in
the visible occupations of Zanoni that betrayed a culti-
vator of the occult sciences, his habits were those of a
man who remembers or reﬂects. He loved to roam alone,
chieﬂy at dawn, or at, night, when the moon was clear
(especially in each month, at its rise and full), miles and
miles away over the rich inlands of the island, and, to cull
herbs'and ﬂowers, which he hoarded with jealous care.
Sometimes at the dead of night, Viola would wake by an
instinct that told her he was not by her side, and, stretch-
ing out her arms, ﬁnd that the instinct had not deceived
her. But she early saw that he was reserved on his pe-
culiar habits, and if at times a chill, a foreboding, a sus-
picious awe crept over her, she forbore to! question him.
But his rambles were not always unaccompanied-_he
took pleasure in excursions less solitary. Often, when the
sea lay before them like a lake, the barren dreariness of
the opposite coast of Cephallenia contrasting the smiling
shores on which they dwelt, Viola and himself would pass
days in cruising slowly around the coast, or in visits to
the neighboring isles. Every spot of the Greek soil, “that
fair Fable-Land,” seemed to him familiar; and as he con~
versed of the Past, and its exquisite traditions, he taught
Viola to love the race from which have descended the

poetry and the wisdom of the world. There was much in
Zanoni, as she knew him better, that deepened the fasci-
nation in which Viola was from the ﬁrst enthralled. His
love for herself was so tender, so vigilant, and had that
best and most enduring attribute, that it seemed rather
grateful for the happiness in its own cares than vain of
the happiness it created. His habitual mood with all who
approached him was calm and gentle, almost to apathy.
An angry word never passed his lips—an angry gleam
never shot from his eyes. Once they had been exposed
to the danger not uncommon in those then half-savage
lands. Some pirates who infested the neighboring coasts
had heard of the arrival of the strangers, and the seamen
Zanoni employed had gossiped of their master’s wealth.
One night after Viola had retired to rest, she was
awakened by a slight noise below. Zanoni was not by
her side; she listened in some alarm. .Was that a groan
that came upon her ear? She started up, she went to
the door; all was still. A footstep now slowly approached,
and Zanoni entered calm as usual, and seemed unconscious
of her fears. The next morning, three men were found
dead at the threshold of the principal entrance, the door
of which had been forced. They were recognized in the
neighborhood as the most sanguinary and terrible mu-
rauders of the coasts—men stained with a thousand mur-
ders, and who had never hitherto failed in any attempt
to which the lust of rapine had impelled them. The foot-
steps of many others were tracked to the sea-shore. It
seemed that their accomplices must have ﬂed on the death

of their leaders. But when the Venetian Proveditore, or
authority, of the island, came to examine into the matter,
the most unaccountable mystery was the manner in which
these rnﬂians had met their fate. Zanoni had not stirred
from thr apartment in which he ordinarily pursued his
chemical studies. None of the servants had even been
disturbed from their slumbers. No marks of human vio--
lence were on the bodies of the dead. They died, and
made no sign. From that moment Zanoni-‘s house—nay,
the whole vicinity—was sacred. The neighboring villages,
rejoiced to be delivered from a scourge, regarded the
stranger as one whom the Pagiana (or Virgin) held under
her especial protection. In truth, the lively Greeks around,
facile to all external impressions, and struck with the
singular and majestic beauty of the man who knew their
language as a native, whose voice often cheered them in
their humble sorrows, and whose hand was never closed
to their wants, long after he had left their shore preserved
his memory by grateful traditions, and still point to the
lofty platanus beneath which they had often seen him
seated, alone and thoughtful, in the heats of noon. But
Zanoni had haunts less open to the gaze than the shade
of thc platanus. In that isle there are the bituminous
springs which Herodotus has commemorated. Often at
night, the moon, at least, beheld him emerging from the
myrtle and cystus that clothe the hillocks around the
marsh that embeds the pools containing the inﬂammable
materia, all the medical uses of which, as applied to the

nerves. of organic life, modern science has not yet perhaps
explored. Yet more often would he pass his hours in a
cavern, by the loneliest part of the beach, where the sta-
lactites seem almost arranged by the hand of art, and
which the superstition of the peasants associates, in some
ancient legends, with the numerous and almost incessant
earthquakes to which the island is so singularly subjected.
Whatever the pursuits that instigated these wanderings
‘ and favored these haunts, either they were linked with, or
else subordinate to, one main and master desire, which
every fresh day passed in the sweet human company of
Viola conﬁrmed and strengthened.
The scene that Glyndon had witnessed in his trance
was faithful to truth. And some little time after the date
of that night, Viola was dimly aware that an inﬂuence,
she knew not of what nature, was struggling to establish
itself over her happy life. Visions indistinct and bean-
tiful, such as those she had known in her earlier days, but
constant and impressive, began to haunt her night and
day when Zanoni was absent, to fade in his presence, and
seem less fair than that. Zanoni questioned her eagerly
and minutely of these visitations, but seemed dissatisﬁed,
and at times perplexed, by her answers.
“ Tell me not,” he said, one day, “ of those unconnected
images, those evolutions of starry shapes in a choral dance,
or those delicious melodies that seem to thee of the music
and the language of the distant spheres. Has no one
shape been to thee more distinct and more beautiful than

own tongue and whispering to thee of strange secrets and
solemn knowledge?”
“ No; all is confused in these dreams, .vhether of day
or night; and when at the sound of thy footsteps I re-
cover, my memory retains nothing but a vague impression
of happiness. How different—how cold—to the rapture
of hanging on thy'smile, and listening to thy voice, when
it says—‘I love thee!”’
“ Yet, how is it that visions less fair than these once
seemed to thee so alluring? How is it that they then
stirred thy fancies and ﬁlled thy heart? Once thou didst
desire a fairy-land, and now thou seemest so contented
with common life!”
“Have I not explained it to thee before? Is it com-
mon life, then, to love and to live with the one we love ?
My true fairy-land is won ! Speak to me of no other.”
And so Night surprised them by the lonely beach; and
Zanoni, allured from his sublimer projects, and bending
over that tender face, forgot that, in the Harmonious
Inﬁnite which spread around, there were other worlds
than that one human heart!

CHAPTER IX.
There is a principle of the soul, superior to all nature, through
which we are capable of surpassing the order and systems of the
world. When the soul is elevated to natures better than itself,
then it is entirely separated from subordinate natures, exchanges
this for another life, and, deserting the order of things with which
it was connected, links and mingles itself with another.—Iau-
nmcuus.
“ADON-AI! Adon-Ai l-appear, appear!”
And in the lonely cave, whence once had gone forth
the oracles of a heathen god, there emerged from the
shadows of fantastic rocks a luminous and gigantic col-
umn, glittering and shifting. It resembled the shining
but misty spray, which, seen afar off, a fountain seems'to
send up on a starry night. The radiance lit the stalae-
tites, the crags, the arches of the cave, and shed a pale
and tremulous splendor on the features of Zanoni.
“ Son of Eternal Light,” said the invoker, “ thou to
whose knowledge, grade after grade, race after race, I
attained at last, on the broad Chaldaean plains-thou from
whom I have drawn so largely of the unutterable know~

but solemn, as with the consciousness of eternity and the
tranquillity of wisdom ; light, like star-beams, ﬂowed
through its transparent veins; light made its limbs them-
selves, and undulated, in restless sparkles, through the
waves of its dazzling hair. With its arms folded on its
breast, it stood distant a few feet from Zanoni, and its
low voice murmured gently—“ My counsels were sweet to
thee once; and once, night after night, thy soul could
follow my wings through the untroubled splendors of the
Inﬁnite. Now thou hast bound thyself back to the earth
by its strongest chains, and the attraction to the clay is
more potent than the sympathies that drew to thy charms
the Dweller of the Star-beam and the Air! When last
thy soul hearkened to me, the senses already troubled
thine intellect and obscured thy vision. Once again I
come to thee; but thy power even to summon me to thy
side is fading from thy spirit, as sunshine fades from the
wave, when the winds drive the cloud between the ocean
and the sky.”
“Alas, Aidon-Ai !” answered the seer, mournfully, “I
know too well the conditions of the being which thy pres-
ence was wont to rejoice. I know that our wisdom comes
but from the indiﬁ'erence to the things of the world which
the wisdom masters. The mirror of the soul cannot re-
ﬂect both earth and heaven ; and the one vanishes from
the surface as the other is glassed upon its deeps. But it

gion, to the spheres,-that once again, and with the
agony and travail of enfeebled power, I have called thee
to mine aid. I love; and in love I begin to live in the
sweet humanities of another! If wise, yet in all which
makes danger powerless against myself, or those on whom
I can gaze from the calm height of indiﬁ'erent science, I
am blind as the merest mortal to the destinies ‘of the
creature that makes my heart beat with the passions which
obscure my gaze.”
“ What matter ! ” answered Aidon-Ai. “ Thy love must
be but a mockery of the name; thou canst not love as
they do for whom there are death and the grave. A short
time ! —like a day in thy incalculable life, and the form
thou dotest on is dust! Others of the nether world go
hand in hand, each with each, unto the tomb; hand in
hand they ascend from the worm to new cycles of existence.
For thee, below are ages; for her, but hours. And for
her and thee — 0 poor, but mighty one l—wil! there be

of spiritualized being will her soul have passed when thou,

is not with me for ever; and seest thou not that I have

tals, feel—debarred yet from the objects of the tremendous
and sublime ambition that ﬁrst winged my desires above
the clay—when I see myself compelled to stand in this
low world alone. ——I have sought amongst my tribe for
comrades, and in vain. At last I have found a mate ! The
wild bird and the wild beast have theirs; and my mastery
over the malignant tribes of terror can banish their larvae
from the path that shall lead her upward, till the air of
eternity ﬁts the frame for the elixir that baﬁies death.”
“And thou hast begun the initiation, and thou art
foiled ! I know it. Thou hast conjured to her sleep the
fairest visions; thou hast invoked the loveliest children
of the air to murmur their music to her trance, and her
soul heeds them not; and, returning to the earth, escapes
from their control. Blind one, wherefore? Canst thou
not'perceive .7 Because in her soul all is love. There is
no intermediate passion with which the things thou wouldst
charm to her have association and afﬁnities. Their at-
traction is but to the desires and cravings of the intellect.
What have they with the passion that is of earth, and the
hope that goes direct to heaven ?” ‘

“ I do comprehend thee, Aidon-Ai,” said Zanoni, with
a light of more human joy upon his face than it had ever
before been seen to wear; “and if my destiny, which here
is dark to mine eyes, vouchsafes to me the happy lot )f
the humble -if ever there be a child that I may clasp to
my bosom and call my own! ”
“ And is it to be man at last, that thou hast aspired to
be more than man?”

“ But a child—a second Viola!” murmured Zanoni,
scarcely heeding the Son of Light; “a young soul fresh
from Heaven, that I may rear from the ﬁrst moment it
touches earth—whose wings I may train to follow mine
through the glories of creation ; and through whom the
mother herself may be led upward over the realm of
death !” i
v “Beware—reﬂect ! Knowest thou not that thy darkest
enemy dwells in the Real ? Thy wishes bring thee near

THoU hast not informed me of the progress of thy
pupil; and I fear that so differently does Circumstance
shape the minds of the generations to which we are de-
scended, from the intense and earnest children of the
earlier world, that even thy most careful and elaborate
guidance would fail, with loftier and purer natures than
that of the Neophyte thou hast admitted within thy gates.
Even that third state of being, which the Indian sage'f
rightly recognizes as being between the sleep and the
waking, and describes imperfectly by the name of TRANCE,
is unknown to the children of the northern world; and
few but would recoil to indulge it, regarding its peopled
calm, as the mdya and delusion of the mind. Instead of

ripening and culturing that airy soil, from which nature,
duly known, can evoke fruits so rich and ﬂowers so fair,
they strive but to exclude it from their gaze; they esteem
that struggle of the intellect from men’s narrow world to
the spirit’s inﬁnite home, as a disease which the leech'
must extirpate with pharmacy and drugs, and know not
even that it is from this condition of their being, in its
most imperfect and infant form, that Poetry, Music, Art
—all that belong to an Idea of Beauty, to which neither
sleeping nor waking can furnish archetype and actual
semblance -——take their immortal birth. When we, 0
Mejnour, in the far time, were ourselves the Neophytes
and Aspirants—we were of a class to which the actual
world was shut and barred. Our forefathers had no ob-
ject in life but knowledge. From the cradle we were
predestined and reared to wisdom as to a priesthood. We
commenced research where modern Conjecture closes its
faithless wings. And with us, those were the common
elements of science which the sages of t'o-day disdain as
wild chimeras, or despair of as unfathomabie mysteries.
Even the fundamental principles, the large, yet simple
theories of Electricity and Magnetism, rest obscure and
dim in the disputes of their blinded schools; yet, even in
our youth, how few ever attained to the ﬁrst circle of the
brotherhood, and, after wearily enjoying the sublime privi-
leges they sought, they voluntarily abandoned the light
of the sun, and sunk, without effort, to the grave, like
pilgrims in a trackless desert, overawed by the stillness
of their solitude. and appalled by the absence of a goal

Thou, in whom nothing seems to live but the desire to
know-thou, who, indifferent whether it leads to weal or
to woe, lendest thyself to all who would tread the path
of mysterious science,—a Human Book, insensate to the
precepts it enounces; thou hast ever sought, and often
made additions to our number. But to these have only
been vouchsafed partial secrets; vanity and passion un-
ﬁtted them for the rest; and now, without other interest
than that of an experiment in science, without love, and
without pity, thou exposest this new soul to the hazards
of the tremendous ordeal ! Thou thinkest that a zeal so
inquisitive, a courage so absolute and dauntless, may suf-
ﬁce to conquer, where austerer intellect and purer virtue
have so often failed. Thou thiukest, too, that the germ
of art that lies in the Painter’s mind, as it comprehends
in itself the entire embryo of Power and Beauty, may be
expanded into the stately ﬂower of the Golden Science.
It is a new experiment-to thee. Be gentle with thy Neo-
phyte, and if his nature disappoint thee in the ﬁrst stages
of the process, dismiss him back to the Real, while it is
yet time to enjoy the brief and outward life which dwells
in the senses, and closes with the tomb. And as I thus
admonish thee, O Mejnour, wilt thou smile at my incon-
sistent hopes? I, who have so invariably refused to
initiate others into our mysteries,—I begin at last to
comprehend why the great law, which binds man to his
kind, even when seeking most to set himself aloof from

sought converts and pupils _why, in seeing life after life
voluntarily dropping from our starry order, thou still as-
pirest to renew the vanished, and repair the lost—why,
amidst thy calculations, restless and unceasing as the
wheels of Nature herself“, thou recoilest from the thought
TO BE ALONEl S0 with myself; at last I, too, seek a
convert—an equal—I, too, shudder to be alone I What
thou hast warned me of has come to pass. Love reduces
all things to itself. Either must I be drawn down to the
nature of the beloved, or hers must be lifted to my own.
As whatever belongs to true Art has always necessarily
had attraction for us, whose very being is in the ideal
whence Art descends, so in this fair creature I have
learned, at last, the secret that bound me to her at the
ﬁrst glance. The daughter of music—music, passing
into her being, became poetry. It was not the stage that
attracted her, with its hollow falsehoods; it was the land
in her own fancy which the stage seemed to centre and
represent. There the poetry found a voice—there it
struggled into imperfect shape; and then (that land, in-
suﬁicient for it) it fell back upon itself. It colored her
thoughts, it suffused her soul; it asked not words, it
created not things; it gave birth but to emotions, and
lavished itself on dreams. At last came love; and there,
as a river into the sea, it poured its restless waves, to
become mute, and deep, and still—the everlasting mirror
of the heavens.
And is it not through this poetry which lies within her
that she may be led into the large poetry of the universe 7

Often I listen to her careless talk, and ﬁnd oracles in its
unconscious beauty, as we ﬁnd strange virtues in some
lonely ﬂower. I see her mind ripening under my eyes ; and
in its fair fertility what ever-teeming novelties of thought!
0 Mejnour ! how many of our tribe have unravelled the
laws of the universe—have solved the riddles of the ex-
terior nature, and deduced the light from darkness! And
is not the POET, who studies nothing but the human
heart, a greater philosopher than all? Knowledge and
theism are incompatible. To know nature is to know
that there must be a God! But does it require this to
examine the method and architecture of creation? Me-
thinks, when I look upon a pure mind, however ignorant
and childlike, that I see the August and Immaterial One,
more clearly than in all the orbs of matter which career
at His bidding through the space.
Rightly is it the fundamental decree of our order, that
we must impart our secrets only to the pure. The most
terrible part of the ordeal is in the temptations that our
power aﬁ'ords to the criminal. If it were possible that a
malevolentbeing could attain to our faculties, what disorder
it might introduce into the globe ! Happy that it is not
possible; the malevolence would disarm the power. It is
on the purity of Viola that I rely, as thou more vainly
hast relied on the courage or the genius of thy pupils.
Bear me witness, Mejnour! Never since the distant day
in Which I pierced the Arcana of our knowledge, have I
ever sought to make its mysteries subservient to unworthy
objects; though, alas! the extension of our existence

robs us of a country and a home; though the law that
places all science, as all art, in the abstraction from the
noisy passions and turbulent ambition of actual life, forbids
us to inﬂuence the destinies of nations, for which Heaven
selects ruder and blinder agencies; yet, wherever have
been my wanderings, I have sought to soften distress, and
to convert from sin. My power has been hostile only to
the guilty; and yet, with all our lore, how in each step we
are reduced to be but the permitted instruments of the
Power, that vouchsafes our own, but only to direct it. How
all our wisdom shrinks'into nought, compared with that
which gives the meanest herb its virtues, and peoples the
smallest globule with its appropriate world! And while
we are allowed at times to inﬂuence the happiness of others,
how mysteriously the shadows thicken round our own
future doom! We cannot be prophets to ourselves!

I have just looked on her in sleep - I have heard her
breathe my name. Alas! that which is so sweet to others
has its bitterness to me; for I think how soon the time
may come when that sleep will be without a dream—-
when the heart that dictates the name will be cold, and the
lips that utter it be dumb. What a twofold shape there
is in love l If we examine it coarsely—if we look but on
its ﬂeshly ties — its enjoyment of a moment—its turbulent
fever and its dull reaction,_ how strange it seems that
this passion should be the supreme mover of the world;
that it is this which has dictated the greatest sacriﬁces,
and inﬂuenced all societies and all times; that to this the
loftiest and loveliest genius has ever consecrated its devo-
tion; that, but for love, there were no civilization—no
music, no poetry, no beauty, no life beyond the brute’s.
But examine it in its heavenlier shape—in its utter
abnegatiou of self -in its intimate connection with all
that is most delicate and subtle in the spirit— its power
above all that is sordid in existence — its mastery over the
idols of the baser worship —its ability to create a palace
of the cottage, an oasis in the desert, a summer in the
Iceland—where it breathes, and fertilizes, and glows ; and
the wonder rather becomes how so few regard it in its
holiest nature. What the sensual call its enjoyments, are
the least of its joys. True love is less a passion than a
symbol. Mejnour, shall the time come when I can speak

Knowest thou that of late I have sometimes asked my-
self, “Is there no guilt in the knowledge that has so
divided as from our race?” It is true that the higher
we ascend, the more hateful seem to us the vices of the
short-lived creepers of the earth — the more the sense of
the goodness of the All-good penetrates and snﬁ'uses us,
and the more immediately does our happiness seem to
emanate from Him. But, on the other hand, how many
virtues must lie dead in those, who live in the world of
death, and refuse to die! Is not this sublime egotism,
this state of abstraction and reverie _this self-wrapt and
self-dependent majesty of existence, a resignation of that
nobility which incorporates our own welfare, our joys,
our hopes, our fears with others? To live on in no dread
of foes, undegraded by inﬁrmity, secure through the cares,
and free from the disease of ﬂesh, is a spectacle that cap-
tivates our pride. And yet dost thou not more admire—
him who dies for another? Since I have loved her, Mej-
nour, it seems almost cowardice to elude the grave which
devours the hearts that wrap us in their folds. I feel it
-_the earth grows upon my spirit. Thou wertright;
eternal age, serene and passionless, is a happier boon

us.” .
“And _the instinct deceives thee not. An enemy is
indeed at hand. I see it through the heavy air; I hear
it through the silence: the Ghostly One—the Destroyer
_the PssTILENQE! Ah, seest thou how the leaves swarm
with insects, only by an eﬁ'ort visible to the eye. They
follow the breath of the plague l ” As he spoke, a bird
fell from the bonghs at Viola’s feet: it ﬂuttered, it writhed
an instant, and was dead.
“ Oh, Viola l ” cried Zanoni, passionately, “ that is
death. Dost thou not fear to die ? ”
( “ To leave thee ? Ah, yes i ”
“ And if I could teach thee how Death may be deﬁed
---it' I could arrest for thy youth the course of time—if I

He paused abruptly, for Viola’s eyes spoke only terror;

her cheek and lips were pale.
“ Speak not thus—look not thus,” she said, recoiling
irom him. “ You dismay me. Ah, speak not thus, or I
should tremble—no, not for myself, but for thy child.”

“ Thy child ! But wouldst thou reject for thy child the
same glorious boon ?”
“Zanoni !”
“ Well I”
“ The sun has sunk from our eyes, but to rise on those
of others. To disappear from this world, is to live in the
world afar. Oh, lover—oh, husband 1” she continued,
with sudden energy, “tell me that thou didst but jest—
that thou didst but triﬂe with my folly! There is less
terror in the pestilence than in thy words.”
Zanoni’s brow darkened; he looked at her in silence
for some moments, and then said, almost severely——
“What hast thou known of me to distrust?"
“ Oh, pardon, pardon !-——nothing ! ” cried Viola, throw-
ing herself on his breast, and bursting into tears. “I will
not believe even thine own words, if they seem to wrong
thee ! ” He kissed the tears from her eyes, but made no
answer.
“ And ah ! ’7 she resumed, with an enchanting and child-
like smile, “if thou wouldst give me a charm against the
pestilence ! see, I will take it from thee.” And she laid
her hand on a small antique amulet that he wore on his
breast.
“Thou knowest how often this has made me jealous
of the past; surely, some love-gift, Zanoni? But no,
thou didst not love the giver as thou dost me. Shall I
steal thine amulet?”
“Infant!” said Zanoni, tenderly; “she who placed

this round my neck deemed it indeed a charm, for she had
superstitious like thyself; but to me it is more than the
Wizard’s spell—it is the relic of a sweet vanished time,
when none who loved me could distrust.”
He said these words in a tone of such melancholy re
preach, that it went to the heart of Viola; but the tone
changed into a solemnity which chilled back the gush of
her feelings as he resumed: “And this, Viola, one day,
perhaps, I will transfer from my breast to thine; yes,
whenever thou shalt comprehend me better—whenever
the laws of our being shall be the same!”
He moved on gently. They returned slowly home; but
fear still was in the heart of Viola, though she strove to
shake it off. Italian and Catholic she was, with all the
superstitions of land and sect. She stole to her chamber,
and prayed before a little relic of San Gennaro, which
the priest of her house had given to her in childhood, and
which had accompanied her in all her wanderings. She
had never deemed it possible to part with it before. Now,
if there was a charm against the pestilence, did she fear
the pestilence for herself? The next morning when he
awoke, Zanoni found the relic of the saint suspended, with
his mystic amulet, round his neck.
“Ah 1 thou wilt have nothing to fear from the pesti-
lence now,” said Viola, between tears and smiles; “and
when thou wouldst talk to me again as thou didst last
night, the saint shall rebuke thee.”
Well, Zanoni, can there ever indeed be commune of
thought and spirit, except with equals?

The sound of this man’s voice, so lusty, ringing, and

-“in your bed, to be sure. Why am I here l—because
the Padrone bade me await your waking, and attend your

“The Padrone, Mejnourl-is he arrived?”
“Arrived and departed, Signor. He has left this letter

“Give it me, and wait without till I am dressed.”
“At your service. I have bespoke an excellent break-

must wrestle with the spectre thou hast invoked!”
The letter fell from Glyndon’s hand. A sort of stupor
succeeded to the various emotions which had chased each
other in the perusal—a stupor, resembling that which
follows the sudden destruction of any ardent and long-
nursed hope in the human heart, whether it be of love,
of avarice, of ambition. The loftier world for which he
had so thirsted, sacriﬁced, and toiled, was closed upon
him “for ever,” and by his own faults of rashness and
presumption. But Glyndon’s was not of that nature
which submits long to condemn itself. His indignation
began to kindle against Mejnour, who owned he had
tempted, and who now abandoned him—abandoned him
to the presence of a spectre. The Mystie’s reproaches
stung, rather than humbled him. What crime had he
committed to deserve language so harsh and disdainful 7
Was it so deep a debasement to feel pleasure in the smile
and the eyes of Fillide? Had not Zanoni himself con-
fessed love for Viola f—had he not ﬂed with her as his
companion? Glyndon never paused to consider if there
are no distinctions between one kind of love and another.
Where, t00, was the great offence of yielding to a tempta-
tion which only existed for the brave? Had not the
mystic volume which Mejnour had purposely left open,
bid him but “Beware of fear?” Was not, then, every
wilful provocative held out to the strongest inﬂuences of
the human mind, in the prohibition to enter the chamber

-—-in the possession of the key which excited his curiosity
—-in the volume which seemed to dictate the mode by
which the curiosity was to be gratiﬁed? As, rapidly,
these thoughts passed over him, he began to consider the
whole conduct of Mejnour either as a perﬁdious design
.to entrap him to his own misery, or as the trick of an
impostor, who knew that he could not realize the great
professions he had made. On glancing again oyer the
more mysterious threats and warnings in Mejnour’s letter,
they seemed to assume the language of mere parable and
allegory—the jargon of the Platonists and Pythagoreans:
By little and little, he began to consider that the very
spectre he had seen—even that one phantom so horrid
in its aspect—were but the delusions which Mejnour’s
science had enabled him to raise. The healthful sun-light,
ﬁlling up every cranny in his chamber, seemed to laugh
away the terrors of the past night. His pride and his
resentment nerved his habitual courage: and when, having
hastily dressed himself, he rejoined Paolo, it was with a
ﬂushed cheek and a haughty step. I
“ So, Paolo,” said he, “the Padrone, as you call him,
told you to expect and welcome me at your village feast?”
“ He did so, by a message from a wretched old cripple.
This surprised me at the time, for I thought he was far
distant. But these great philosophers make a joke of
two or three hundred leagues.”
“Why did you not tell me you had heard from Mej-
nour ? ”
"Because the old cripple forbade me.”

“Did you not see the man afterwards during the
dance ? ”
“ N0, Excellency.”
“ Humph l ”
“Allow me to serve you,” said Paolo, piling Glyndon’s
plate, and then ﬁlling his glass. “I wish, Signor, now
the Padrone is gone,—not”—added Paolo, as be cast
rather a frightened and suspicions glance round the room
—-“ that I mean to say anything disrespectful of him,-—-
I wish, I say, now that he is gone, that you would take
. pity on yourself, and ask your own heart what your youth
was meant for? Not to bury yourself alive in these old
ruins, and endanger body and soul by studies which I am
sure no saint could approve of.”
“Are the saints so partial, then, to your own occupa-
tions, Master Paolo f”
“Why,” answered the bandit, a little confused, “ a
gentleman with plenty of pistoles in his purse, need not,
of necessity, make it his profession to take away the pistoles

Glyndon thought there was some sound philosophy in
the reasoning of his companion ; and certainly, the more
he ate and drank, the more the recollection of the past
night and of Mejnour’s desertion faded from his mind.

Glyndon listened yet more complacently when Paolo

the ankles, and the shape of the handsome Fillide.
This man, indeed, seemed the very personation of animal
sensual life. He would have been to Faust a more danger-
ous tempter than Mephistopheles. There was no sneer
on his lip at' the pleasures which animated his voice. To
one awaking to a sense of the vanities in knowledge, this
reckless ignorant joyousuess of temper was a worse cor-
rupter than all the icy mockeries of a learned Fiend. But
when Paolo took his leave, with a promise to return the
next day, the mind of the Englishman again settled back

to a graver and more thoughtful mood. The elixir seemed,
in truth, to have left the reﬁning effects Mejnour had
ascribed to it. As Glyndon paced to and fro the solitary
corridor, or, pausing, gazed upon the extended and glorious
scenery that stretched below, high thoughts of enterprise
and ambition—bright visions of glory- passed in rapid
succession through his soul.
“ Mejnour denies me his science. Well," said the painter,
proudly, “he has not robbed me of my art.”

the Judgment of the Dead by the Living: * when the corpse,
duly embalmed, is placed by the margin of the Acherusian
Lake; and before it may be consigned to the bark which
is to bear it across the waters to its ﬁnal resting-place, it
is permitted to the appointedjudges to hear all accusations
of the past life of the deceased, and, if proved, to deprive
the corpse of the rites of sepultnre.
Unconsciously to himself, it was Mejnour’s description
of this custom, which he had illustrated by several anec-
dotes not to be found in books, that now suggested the
design to the artist, and gave it reality and force. He
supposed a powerful and guilty king whom in life scarce
a whisper had dared to arraign, but against whom, now
the breath was gone, came the slave from his fetters, the
mutilated victim from his dungeon, livid and squalid as
if dead themselves, invoking with parched lips the justice
that outlives the grave.
Strange fervor this, 0 Artist! breaking suddenly forth
from the mists and darkness which the occult science had
spread so long over thy fancies—strange that the reaction
of the night’s terror and the day’s disappointment should
be back to thine holy art! Oh, how freely goes the bold
hand over the large outline! How, despite those rude
materials, speaks forth no more the pupil, but the master!

creatures the ﬁner life denied to thyselfl-some power
not thine own writes the grand symbols on the wall.

for money-no! he was worldly rather than mercenary. .
He had no romantic ideas of love ; but he was too sensible
a man not to know that a wife should be a companion-
not merely a speculation. He did not care for beauty
and genius, but he liked health and good temper, and a
certain proportion of useful understanding. He chose a
wife from his reason, not his heart, and a very good choice
he made. Mrs. Mervale was an excellent young woman
-bustling, managing, economical, but aﬁ'ectionate and
good. She had a will of her vown, but was no shrew.
She had a great notion of the rights of a wife, and a
strong perception of the qualities that insure comfort.
She would never have forgiven her husband, had she found
him guilty of the most passing fancy for another; but,
in return, she had the most admirable sense of propriety
herself. She held in abhorreuce all levity, all ﬂirtation,
all coquetry-small vices, which often ruin domestic
happiness, but which a giddy nature incurs without con-
sideration. But she did not think it right to love a bus-
band over-much. She left a surplus of aﬁ'ection for all
her relations, all her friends, some of her acquaintances,
and the possibility of a second marriage, should any
accident happen to Mr. M. She kept a good table, for
it suited their station; and her temper was considered
even, though ﬁrm; but she could say a sharp thing or
two, if Mr. Mervale was not punctual to a moment. She
was very particular that he should change his shoes on
coming home—the carpets were new and expensive She
was not sulky, nor passionate—Heaven bless her for that l

_but when displeased she showed it, administered a
digniﬁed rebuke—alluded to her own virtues—to her
uncle, who was an admiral, and to the thirty thousand
pounds which she had brought to the object of her choice,
But as Mr. Mervale was a good-humored man, owned his
faults, and subscribed to her excellence, the displeasure
was soon over.
Every household has its little disagreements, none fewer
than that of Mr. and Mrs. Mervale. Mrs. Mervale, with-
out being improperly fond of dress, paid due attention to
it. ~ She was never seen out of her chamber with papers
in her hair, nor in that worst of dis-illusions — a morning
wrapper. At half-past eight every morning, Mrs. Mervale
was dressed for the day—that is, till she re~dressed for
dinner;—her stays well laced—her cap prime,—her gowns,
winter and summer, of a‘thick, handsome silk. Ladies at
that time were very short waists; so did Mrs. Mervale.
Her morning ornaments were a thick gold chain, to which
was suspended a gold watch—none of those fragile dwarfs
of mechanism, that look so pretty, and go so ill-_but a
handsome repeater, which chronicled Father Time to a
moment; also a mosaic brooch; also a miniature of her
uncle, the admiral, set in a bracelet. For the evening,
she had two handsome sets—necklace, ear-rings, and
bracelets complete -0ne of amethysts, the other topazes.
With these, her costume for the most part was a gold-
colored satin and a turban, in which last her picture had
been taken. Mrs. Mervale had an aquiline nose, good
teeth, fair hair, and light eye-lashes, rather a high com-

plexion, what is generally called a ﬁne bust. full cheeks,
large useful feet, made for walking, large white hands,
with ﬁlbert nails, on which not a speck of dust had, even
in childhood, ever been‘known to alight. She looked a
little older than she really was; but that might arise from
a certain air of dignity and the aforesaid aquiline nose.
She generally wore short mittens. She never read any
poetry but Goldsmith’s and Cowper’s. She was not
amused by novels, though she had no prejudice against
them. She liked a play and a pantomime, with a slight
supper afterwards. She did not like concerts nor operas.
At the beginning of the winter she selected some book
to read, and some piece of work to commence. The two
lasted her till the spring, when, though she continued to
work, she left off reading. Her favorite study was his-
tory, which she read through the medium of Dr. Gold-
smith. Her favorite author in the belles lettres was, of
course, Dr. Johnson. A worthier woman, or one more
respected, was not to be found, except in an epitaph 1
It was an autumn night. Mr. and Mrs. Mervale, lately
returned from an excursion to Weymouth, are in the
drawing-room—“the dame sat on this side—the man
sat on that.”
" Yes, I assure you, my dear, that Glyndon, with all
his eccentricities, was a very engaging, amiable fellow.
You would certainly have liked him—all the women
did.”

“I beg your pardon --you are right. I meant to say
that he was a general favorite with your charming sex.”
“I understand—rather a frivolous character.”
“ Frivolous ! no, not exactly; _a little unsteady—very
odd-but certainly not frivolous; presumptuous and
headstrong in character, but modest and shy in his man-
ners, rather too much so _just what you like. However,
to return; I am seriously uneasy at the accounts I have
heard of him to-day. He has been living, it seems, a
very strange and irregular life, travelling from place to
place, and must have spent already a great deal of money.”
“Apropos of money,” said Mrs. Mervale; “I fear we
must change our butcher; he is certainly in league with
the cook.”
“ That is a pity; his beef is remarkably ﬁne. These
London servants are as bad as the Carbonari. But, as I

was saying, poor Glyndon ”
Here a knock was heard at the door. “Bless me,”

sibly be ? ”
“ Perhaps your uncle, the admiral,” said the husband,
with a slight peevishness in his accent. “ He generally
favors us about this hour." ‘
“I hope, my love, that none of my relations are un-
welcome visitors at your house. The admiral is a most
entertaining man, and his fortune is entirely at his own
disposal.”
“No one I respect more,” said Mr. Mervale. with

The servant threw open the door, and announced Mr.
Glyndon.
“Mr. Glyndon l—what an extraordinary ” ex-

claimed Mrs. Mervale; but before she could conclude the
sentence, Glyndon was in the room
The two friends greeted each other with all the warmth
of early recollection and long absence. An appropriate
and proud presentation to Mrs. Mervale ensued; and
Mrs. Mervale, with a digniﬁed, smile, and a furtive glance
at his boots, bade her husband’s friend welcome to England.
Glyndon was greatly altered since Mervale had' seen,
him last. Though less than two years had elapsed since
then, his fair complexion was more bronzed and manly.
Deep lines of care, or thought, or dissipation, had re-
placed the smooth contour of happy youth. To a man-
ner once gentle and polished, had succeeded a certain
recklessness of mien, tone, and hearing, which bespoke
the habits of a society that cared little for the calm de-
corums of conventional ease. Still a kind of wild noble-
ness, not before apparent in him, characterized his aspect,
and gave something of dignity to the freedom of his
language and gestures.
“ So, then, you are settled, Mervale— I need not ask
you if you are happy. Worth, sense, wealth, character,
and so fair a companion, deserve happiness, and com-
mand it.” '
“Would you like some tea, Mr. Glyndon ? ” asked Mrs
Mervale, kindly.
“Thank you—no. I propose a more convivial stimulus

bowl of old English punch. Your wife will excuse us—
we will make a night of it!”
Mrs. Mervale drew back her chair, and tried not to
look aghast. Glyndon did not give his friend time to
reply. .
“ So at last I am in England,” he said, looking round
the room, with a slight sneer on his lips; “surely this
sober air must have its inﬂuence; surely here I shall be
‘like the rest.”
“ Have you been ill, Glyndon?"
“ Ill! yes. Humph l you have a ﬁne house. Does it
contain a spare room for a solitary wanderer?”
Mr. Mervale glanced at his wife, and his wife looked
steadily on the carpet. “ Modest and shy in his manners
_rather too much so ! ” Mrs. Mervale was in the seventh
heaven of indignation and amaze!
“ My dear ? ” said Mr. Mervale at last, meekly and in-
terrogatingly. 4
“My dear!” returned Mrs. Mervale, innocently and
sourly.
“We can make up a room for my old friend, Sarah ?”
The old friend had sunk back on his chair; and, gazing
intently on the ﬁre, with his feet at ease upon the fender,
seemed to have forgotten his question.
Mrs. Mervale hit her lips, looked thoughtful, and at last
coldly replied-“ Certainly, Mr. Mervale; your friends
do right to make themselves at home.”
With that she lighted a candle, and moved majestically

vanished into Mr. Mervale’s study.
Twelve o’clock struck—one o’clock—two! Thrice
had Mrs. Mervale sent into the room to know—ﬁrst, if
they wanted anything; secondly, if Mr. Glyndon slept on
a mattress or feather bed ; thirdly, to inquire if Mr.
Glyndon’s trunk, which he had brought with him, should
be unpacked. And to the answer to all these questions,
was added, in a loud voice from the visitor—a voice that
pierced from the kitchen to the attic— “Another bowl!
stronger, if you please, and be quick with it!”
At last Mr. Mervale appeared in the conjugal chamber

THE next morning, at breakfast, Mrs. Mervale looked
as if all the wrongs of injured woman sat upon her brow.
Mr. Mervale seemed the picture of remorseful guilt and
avenging bile. He said little, except to complain of
headache, and to request the eggs to be rem0ved from
the table. Clarence Glyndon -—impervious, unconscious,
unailing, impenitent—was in noisy spirits, and talked
for three.
“ Poor Mervale l he has lost the habit of good fellow-
ship, madam. Another night or two, and he will be him-
self again 1”
“Sir,” said Mrs. Mervale, launching a premeditated
sentence with more than Johnsonian dignity; “permit
me to remind you that Mr. Mervale is now a married
man, the destined father of a family, and the present
master of a household.” \
“Precisely the reasons why I envy him so much. 1 ‘
myself have a great mind to marry. Happiness is con-
tagious.”

"Do you still take to painting ?” asked Mervale, lan-
guidly, endeavoring to turn the tables on his guest.
“Oh, no; I have adopted your advice. No art, no
ideal-nothing loftier than Common-place for me now.
If I were to paint again, I positively think you would
purchase my pictures. Make haste and ﬁnish your break-
fast, man ; I wish to consult you. I have come to England
to see after my affairs. My ambition is to make money;
your counsels and experience cannot fail to assist me here. ”
“Ah I you were s00n disenchanted of your Philosopher’s
stone. You must know, Sarah, that when I last left Glyn-
don, he was bent upon turning alchemist and magician. ”
“You are witty to-day, Mr. Mervale.”
“ Upon my honor it is true. I told you so before.”
Glyndon rose abruptly.
“Why revive those'recollections of folly and presump-

market, sell it at the dearest. Have you not breakfasted
yet?” ' \
The friends walked into the streets, and Mervale shrunk
from the irony with which Glyndon complimented him on
his respectability, his station, his pursuits, his happy mar-
riage, and his eight pictures in their handsome frames.

over his friend: his had been the sarcasm; Glyndon’s the
irresolute shame at his own peculiarities. Now this position
was reversed. There was a ﬁerce earnestness in Glyndon’s
altered temper, which awed and silenced the quiet common-
place of his friend’s character. He seemed to take a
malignant delight in persuading himself that the sober
life of the world was contemptible and base.
"Ah l ”he exclaimed, “how right you were to tell me to
marry respectably; to have a solid position; to live in
dccorous fear of the world and one’s wife ; and to command
the envy of the poor, the good opinion of the rich l You
have practised what you preach. Delicious existence!
The merchant’s desk, and the curtain lecture l Hal ha!
Shall we have another night of it?”
Mervale, embarrassed and irritated, turned the conver-
sation upon Glyndon’s aﬂ'airs. He was surprised at-the
knowledge of the world which the artist seemed to have
suddenly acquired; surprised still more at the acuteness
and energy with which he spoke of the speculations most
in vogue at the market. Yes; Glyndon was certainly in
earnest; he desired to be rich and respectable,— and to
make at least ten per cent. for his money 1
After spending some days with the merchant, during
which time he contrived to disorganize all the mechanism
of the house, to turn night into day, harmony into discord,
to drive poor Mrs. Mervale half-distracted, and to convince
her husband that he was horibly hen-packed, the ill-
omened visitor left them as suddenly as he had arrived.
He took a house of his own; he sought the society of

persons of substance; he devoted himself to the money-
market; he seemed to have become a man of business;
his schemes were bold and colossal ; his calculations rapid
and profound. He startled Mervale by his energy, and
dazzled him by his success. Mervale began to envy him
-to be discontented with his own regular and slow gains.
When Glyndon bought or sold in the funds, wealth rolled
upon him like the tide of a. sea; what years of toil could
not have done for him in art, a few months, by a succession
of lucky chances, did for him in speculation. Suddenly,
however, he relaxed his exertions; new objects of ambition
seemed to attract him. If he heard a drum in the streets,
what glory like the soldier’s? If a new poem were pub-
lished, what renown like the poet’s ‘Z He began works in
literature, which promised great excellence, to throw them
aside in disgust. All at once he abandoned the decorous
and formal society he had courted ; he joined himself with
young and riotous associates: he plunged into the wildest
excesses of the great city, where Gold reigns alike over
Toil and Pleasure. Through all, he carried with him a
certain power and heat of soul. In all society he aspired
to command—in all pursuits to excel. Yet whatever
the passion of the moment, the reaction was terrible in
its gloom. He sunk, at times, into the most profound
and the darkest reveries. His fever was that of a mind
that would escape memory—his repose, that of a mind
which the memory seizes again, and devours as a prey.
Mervale now saw little of him; they shunned each other.
Glyndon had no conﬁdant, and no friend.

CHAPTER IV.

UHLAND.
FROM this state of restlessness and agitation rather than
continuous action, Glyndon was aroused by a visitor who
seemed to exercise the most salutary inﬂuence over him.
His sister, an orphan with himself, had resided in the
country with her aunt. In the early years of hope and
home, he had loved this girl, much younger than himself,
with all a brother’s tenderness. On his return to England,
he had seemed to forget her existence. She recalled herself
to him on her aunt’s death by a touching and melancholy
letter ;—she had now no home but his—no dependence
save on his affection: he we'pt when he read it, and was
inpatient till Adela arrived.
This girl, then about eighteen, concealed beneath a
gentle and calm exterior much of the romance or enthu-
siasm that had, at her own age, characterized her brother.
But her enthusiasm was of a far purer order, and was

restrained within proper bounds, partly by the sweetness
of a very feminine nature, and partly by a strict and me-
thodical education. She differed from him especially in
a timidity of character, which exceeded that usual at her
age, but which the habit of self-command concealed no
less carefully, than that timidity itself concealed the romance
l have ascribed to her.
Adela was not handsome ; she had the complexion and
the form of delicate health; and too ﬁne an organization
of the nerves rendered her susceptible to every impression
that could inﬂuence the health of the frame through the
sympathy of the mind. But as she never complained, and
as the singular serenity of her manners seemed to betoken
an equanimity of temperament which, with the vulgar,
might have passed for indifference, her sufferings had so
long been borne unnoticed, that it ceased to be an eﬁ'ort
to disguise them. Though, as I have said, not handsome,
her countenance was interesting and pleasing; and there
was that caressing kindness, that winning charm about
her smile, her manners, her anxiety to please, to comfort,
and to soothe, which went at once to the heart, and made
her lovely—because so loving.
Such was the sister whom Glyndon had so long ne-
glected, and whom he now so cordially welcomed. Adela
had passed many years a victim to the caprices, and a
nurse to the maladies of a selﬁsh and exacting relation.
The delicate, and generous, and respectful affection of her
brother was no less new to her than delightful. He took
pleasure in' the happiness he created ; he gradually weaned

himself from other society; he felt the Charm of Home.
It is not surprising then, that this young creature, free
and virgin from every more ardent attachment, concen-
trated all her grateful love on this cherished and protecting
relative. Her study by day, her dream by night, was to
repay him for his aﬁ'ectiou. She was proud of his talents,
devoted to his welfare; the smallest triﬂe that could in-
terest him swelled in her eyes to the gravest affairs of life.
In short, all the long-boarded enthusiasm, which was her
perilous and only heritage, she invested in this one object
of her holy tenderness, her pure ambition.
But in proportion as Glyndon shunned those excitements
by which he had so leng sought to occupy his time, or
distract his thoughts, the gloom of his calmer hours became
deeper and more continuous. He ever and especially
dreaded to be alone ; he could not hear his new companion
to be absent from his eyes; he rode with her, walked with
her, and it was with visible reluctance, which almost par-
took of horror, that he retired to rest at an hour when
even revel grows fatigued. This gloom was not that which
could be called by the soft name of melancholy— it was
far more intense: it seemed rather like despair. Often
after a silence as of death,——so heavy, abstracted, motion-
less, did it appear,-_he would start abruptly, and cast
hurried glances around him—his limbs trembling, his lips
livid, his brows bathed in dew. Convinced that some
secret sorrow preyed upon his mind, and would consume
his health, it was the dearest as the most natural desire
of Adela to become his conﬁdant and consoler. She ob-

served, with the quick tact of the delicate, that he disliked
her to seem affected by, or even sensible of, his darker
moods. She schooled herself to suppress her fears and
her feelings. She would not ask his conﬁdence—she
sought to steal into it. By little and little, she felt that
she was succeeding. Too wrapt in his own strange exist-
ence to be acutely observant of the character of others,
Glyndon mistook the self-content of a generous and hum-
ble aﬂ'ection for constitutional fortitude; and this quality
pleased and soothed him. It is fortitude that the diseased
mind requires in the conﬁdant whom it selects as its phy-
sician. And how irresistible is that desire to communi-
cate 1 How often the lonely man thought to himself, “My
heart would be lightened of its misery, if once confessed 1"
He felt, too, that in the very youth, the inexperience, the
poetical temperament of Adela, he could ﬁnd one who
would comprehend and bear with him better than any
sterner and more practical nature. Mervale would have
looked on his revelations as the ravings of madness, and
most men, at best, as the sicklied chimeras, the optical
delusions, of disease. Thus gradually preparing himself
for that relief for which he yearned, the moment for his
disclosure arrived thns : --
One evening, as they sat alone together, Adela, who
inherited some portion of her brother’s talent in art, was
employed in drawing, and Glyndon, musing himself from
meditations less gloomy than usual, rose, and affection-
ately passing his arm round her waist, looked over her as
she sat An exclamation of dismay broke from his lips—

he snatched the drawing from her hand: “What are you
about ? — what portrait is this f”
“Dear Clarence, do you not remember the original 7—-
1t is a copy from that portrait of our wise ancestor which
our poor mother used to say so strongly resembled you.
I thought it would please you if I copied it from memory.”
“ Accursed was the likeness! ” said Glyndon, gloomily.
“ Guess you not the reason why I have shunned to return
to the home of my fathers ?——because I dreaded to meet
that portrait !-- because - because — but pardon me - I
alarm you!”
“ Ah, no—no, Clarence, you never alarm me when you
speak, only when you are silent! Oh, if you thought me
worthy of your trust! oh, if you had given me the right
to reason with you in the sorrows that I yearn to share ! "
Glyndon made no answer, but paced the room for some
moments with disordered strides. He stopped at last, and
gazed at her earnestly. “Yes, you, too, are his descend-
ant! you know that such men have lived and suffered—
you will not mock me—you will not disbelieve ! Listen I
harki—what sound is that?”
“But the wind on the house-top, Clarence—but the
wind."
“ Give me your hand, let me feel its living clasp, and
when I have told you, never revert to the tale again_
Conceal it from all—swear that it shall die with us_the
last of our predestined race!”

Glyndon commenced his story. That which, perhaps in
writing and to minds prepared to question and disbelieve,
may seem cold and terrorless, became far diﬁerent when
told by those blanched lips, with all that truth of suffering
which convinces and appals. Much, indeed, he concealed,
much he involuntarily softened ; but he revealed enough
to make his tale intelligible and distinct to his pale and
trembling listener. “ At daybreak,” he said, “I left that
unhallowed and abhorred abode. I had one hope still——
I would seek Mejnour through the world. I would force
‘ him to lay at rest the ﬁend that haunted my soul. With
this intent I journeyed from city to city. I instituted the
most vigilant researches through the police of Italy. ‘I
even employed the services of the Inquisition at Rome,
which had lately asserted its ancient powers in the trial
of the less dangerous Cagliostro. All was in vain; not
a trace of him could be discovered. I was not alone,
_ Adela.” Here Glyndon paused a moment, as if em-
barrassed ; for in his recital, I need scarcely say that he
had only indistinctly alluded to Fillide, whom the reader
may surmise to be his companion. “I was not alone,
but the associate of my wanderings was not one in whom
my soul could conﬁde—faithful and aﬁ'ectionate, but with-
out education, without faculties to comprehend me, with
natural instincts rather than cultivated reason—one in
whom the heart might lean in its careless hours, but with
whom the mind could have no commune, in whom the
bewildered spirit could seek no guide. Yet in the society
of this person the daemon troubled me not. Let me ex-

plain yet more fully the dread conditions of its presence.
In coarse excitement, in common-place life, in the wild
riot, in the ﬁerce excess, in the torpid lethargy of that
animal existence which we share with the brutes, its eyes
were invisible, its whisper was unheard. But whenever
the son! would aspire, whenever the imagination kindled
to the loftier ends, whenever the consciousness of our
proper destiny struggled against the unworthy life I pur-
sued, then —Adela, then, it cowered by my side in the
light of noon, or sat by my bed—a Darkness visible
through the Dark. If, in the galleries of Divine Art, the .
dreams of my youth woke the early emulation—if I turned
to the thoughts of sages—if the example of the great, if
the converse of the wise, aroused the silenced intellect,
the daemon was with me as by a spell. At last, one even-
ing at Genoa, to which city I had travelled in pursuit of
the Mystic, suddenly, and when least expected, he ap-
peared before me. It was the time of the Carnival. It
was in one of those half-frantic scenes of noise and revel,
call it not gaiety, which establish a heathen saturnalia in
the midst of a Christian festival. Wearied with the dance,
I had entered a room in which several revellers were
seated, drinking, singing, shouting; and in their fantastic
dresses and hideous masks, their orgie seemed scarcely
human I placed myself amongst them, and in that fearful
excitement of the spirits which the happy never know, I
was soon the most riotous of all. The conversation fell
on the BeVolution of France, which had always possessed'
for me an absorbing fascination. The masks spoke of the

millennium it was to bring on earth, not as philosophers
rejoicing in the advent of light, but as rufﬁans exulting
in the annihilation of law. I know not why it was, but
their licentious language infected myself; and, always
desirous to be foremost in every circle, I soon exceeded
even these rioters iu declamations on the nature of the
liberty which was about to embrace all the families of the
globe—a liberty that should pervade not only public leg-
islation, but domestic life—an emancipation from every
fetter that men had forged for themselves. In the midst
of this tirade, one of the masks whispered me—
“‘Take care. One listens to you, who seems to be a
spy l’
l “ My eyes followed those of the mask, and I observed
a man who took no part in the conversation, but whose
gaze was bent upon me. He was disguised like the rest,
yet I found by a general whisper that none had observed
him enter. His silence, his attention, had alarmed the
fears of the other revellers—they only excited me the
more. Rapt in my subject, I pursued it, insensible to the
signs of those about me ; and, addressing myself only to
the silent mask who sat alone, apart from the group, I did
not even observe that, one by one, the revellers slunk off,
and that I and the silent listener were left alone, until,
pausing from my heated and impetnous declamations, I
said—

“ ‘And life without God,’ added the mask, as I hesitated
for new images.
“ The sound of that well-known voice changed the
current of my thought. I sprung forward, and cried——
“‘Impostor or Fiend, we meet at last!’
“ The ﬁgure rose as I advanced, and, unmasking, showed
the features of Mejnour. His ﬁxed eye—his majestic
aspect, awed and repelled me. I stood rooted to the
ground.
“ ‘ Yes,’ he said, solemnly, ' we meet, and it is this meet-

“At that instant a troop of masks, clamorous, intoxi-
cated, reeling, and rushing as they reeled, poured into the
room, and separated me from the Mystic. I broke through
them, and sought him everywhere, but in vain. All my
researches the next day were equally fruitless. Weeks
were consumed in the same pursuit—not a trace of Mej-
nour could be discovered. Wearied with false pleasures,
roused by reproaches I had deserved, recoiling from Mej-
nour’s prophecy of the scene in which I was to seek de-
liverance, it occurred to me, at last, that in the sober air
of my native'country, and amidst its orderly and vigorous
pursuits, I might work out my own emancipation from
the spectre. I left all whom I had before courted and
clung to ; — I came hither. Amidst mercenary schemes
and selﬁsh speculations, I found the same relief as in
debauch and excess. The Phantom was invisible; but
these pursuits soon became to me distasteful as the rest.
Ever and ever I felt that I was born for something nobler
than the greed of gain -—that life may be made equally
worthless, and the soul equally degraded by the icy lust
of Avarice, as by the noisier passions. A higher Ambi-
tion never ceased to torment me. But, but,"— continued
Glyn'don, with a whitening lip and a visible shudder, “at
every attempt to rise into loftier existence, came that

hideous form. It gluomed beside meat the easel. Before
the volumes of Poet and Sage it stood with its burning
eyes in the stillness of night, and I thought I heard its
horrible whispers uttering temptations never to be di-_
vulged.” He paused, and the drops stood upon his brow.
“ But I,” said Adela, mastering her fears, and throwing
her arms around him -“ But I henceforth will have no
life but in thine. And in this love, so pure, so holy, thy
terror shall fade away.”
“ No, no l” exclaimed Glyndon, starting from her.
“ The worst revelation is to come. Since thou hast been
here—since I have sternly and resolutely refrained from
every haunt, every scene in which this preternatural enemy
troubled me not, I—I—have— Oh, Heaven! Mercy——

to life and reason, he was unutterably shocked by the
change in his sister’s appearance; at ﬁrst, ne fondly
imagined that her health, aﬂ'ected by her vigils, would
recover with his own. But he soon saw, with an anguish
which partook of remorse, that the malady was deep-
seated—deep, deep, beyond the reach of Esculapius and
his drugs. Her imagination, little less lively than his own,
was awfully impressed by the strange confessions she had
heard,—by the ravings of his delirium. Again and again,
had he shrieked forth, “ It is there --there, by thy side,
my sister I ” He had transferred to her fancy the spectre,
and the horror that cursed himself. He perceived this,
not by her‘qwords, but her silence—by the eyes that
strained into space—by the shiver that came over her
frame - by the start of terror—by the lookthat did not
dare to turn behind. Bitterly he repented his confession
--bitterly he felt that between his sufferings and human
sympathy, there could be no gentle and holy commune ;
vainly he sought to retract-to undo what he had done—
to declare all was but the chimera of an over-heated brain I
And brave and generous was this denial of himself; for,
often and often, as he thus spoke, he saw the Thing of
Dread gliding to her side, and glaring at him as he dis-
o'wned its being. But what chilled him, if possible, yet
more than her wasting form and trembling nerves, was
the change in her love for him; a natural terror had re-
placed it. She turned paler if he approached-she shud-
dered if he took her hand. Divided from the rest of earth,
the gulf of the foul remembrance yawned now between

his sister and himself. He could endure no more the
presence of the one whose life his life had embittered. He
made some excuses for departure, and writhed to see that
they were greeted eagerly. The ﬁrst gleam ofjoy he had
detected, since that fatal night, on Adela’s face, he beheld
when he murmured “Farewell.” He travelled for some
weeks through the wildest parts of Scotland; scenery,
which makes the artist, was loveless to his haggard eyes_
A letter recalled him to London, on the wings of new
agony and fear ; he arrived to ﬁnd his sister in a condition
both of mind and health which exceeded his worst appre-
hensions.
Her vacant look—her lifeless posture, appalled him; it
was as one who gazed on the Medusa’s head, and felt,
without a struggle, the human being gradually harden to
the statue. It was not frenzy, it was not idiotcy—it was
an abstraction, an apathy, a sleep in waking. Only as the
night advanced towards the eleventh hour, --the hour in
which Glyndon had concluded his tale,—she grew visibly
uneasy, anxious, and perturbed. Then her lips muttered,
her hands writhed; she looked round with a look of un-
speakable appeal for succor—for protection; and sud-
denly, as the clock struck, fell with a shriek to the ground,
cold and lifeless. With diﬂiculty, and not until after the
most earnest prayers, did she answer the agonized ques-
tions of Glyndon; at last she owned that at that hour,
and that hour alone, wherever she was placed, however
occupied, she distinctly beheld the apparition of an old
hag; who, after thrice knocking at the door, entered the

room, and hobbling up to her, with a countenance dis-
torted by hideous rage and menace, laid its icy ﬁngers on
her forehead ; from that moment she declared that sense
forsook her; and when she woke again,_it was only to
wait, in suspense that froze up her blood, the repetition
01 the ghastly visitation.
The physician who had been summoned before Glyn-
don’s return, and whose letter had recalled him to London,
was a common-place practitioner; ignorant of the case,
and honestly anxious that one more experienced should
be employed. Clarence called in one of the most eminent
of the faculty, and to him he recited the optical delusion
of his sister. The physician listened attentively, and
seemed sanguine in his hopes of cure. He came to the
house two hours before the one so dreaded by the patient.
He had quietly arranged that the clocks should be put
forward half an hour, unknown to Adela, and even to her
brother. He was a man of the most extraordinary powers
of conversation, of surpassing wit, of all the faculties that
interest and amuse. He ﬁrst administered to the patient
a harmless potion, which he pledged himself would dispel
the delusion. His conﬁdent tone woke her own hopes—
he continued to excite her attention, to rouse her lethargy ;
he jested, he laughed away the time. The hour struck.
“Joy, my brother!” she exclaimed, throwing herself in
his arms; “the time is past!” And then, like one re-
leased from a spell, she suddenly assumed more than her
ancient cheerfulness. “Ah, Clarence 1” she whispered,
“ forgive me for my former desertion— forgive me that I

banish the spectre that haunts my brother I” And Clar-
ence smiled and wiped the tears from his burning eyes.
The physician renewed his stories, his jests. In the midst
of a stream of rich humor, that seemed to carry away both
brother and sister, Glyndon suddenly saw over Adela’s
face the same fearful change, the same anxious look, the
same restless, straining eye, he had beheld the night be-
fore. He rose—he approached her. Adela started up.
“ Look—look _look I ” she exclaimed. “ She comes I
Save me-'save me I” and she fell at his feet in strong
convulsions; as the clock, falsely and in vain put back,
struck the half-hour.
The physician lifted her in his arms. “ My worst fears
are conﬁrmed,” he said gravely; “the disease is epilepsy.”'*
The next night, at the same hour, Adela Glyndon died.

“There is a painter here-a great man, one of their

~ But as the painter spoke, it hymned, it rolled through
the streets-the ﬁery song of the Marseillaisel There
was a crowd — a multitude - a people up, abroad, with
colors and arms, enthusiasm and song ; — with song, with
enthusiasm, with colors and arms 1 And who could guess
that that martial movement was one, not of war, but
massacre -_ Frenchmen against Frenchmen ? For there
are two parties in Marseilles _- and ample work for Jour-
dan Ooupe-téte ! But this, the Englishman, just arrived,
a stranger to all factions, did not as yet comprehend. He
comprehended nothing but the song, the enthusiasm, the
arms, and the colors that lifted to the sun the glorious
lie —“Le peuple Franyaz's, debout contre Zes tyrans! ” *
The dark brow of the wretched wanderer grew anima-
ted ; he gazed from the window on the throng that marched
below, beneath their waving Oriﬂame. They shouted as
they beheld the patriot Nicot, the friend of Liberty and
relentless Hebert, by the stranger’s side, at the easement.
“Ay, shout again i ” cried the painter -“ shout for the
brave Englishman who abjures his Pitts and his Goburgs
to be a citizen of Liberty and France!”
A thousand voices rent the air, and the hymn of the
Marseillaise rose in majesty again.
_“ Well, and if it be among these high hopes and this
brave people that the phantom is to vanish, and the cure
to come!” muttered Glyndon; and he thought he felt
again the elixir sparkling through his veins.

“Ah, if I could but see Paris I" cried Fillide, in her
joyous voice. Joyous ! the whole time, the town, the air

of murder—were joy! Sleep unhaunting in thy grave,

SUPERSTITION DESERTING FAITH.
CHAPTER I.
Therefore the Genii were painted with a platter full of garlands and
ﬂowers in one hand, and a whip in the omen—ALEXANDER Ross,
Mystag. Poet.
ACCORDING to the order of the events related in this
narrative, the departure of Zanoni and Viola from the
Greek Isle, in which two happy years appear to have been
passed, must have been somewhat later in date than the
arrival of Glyndon at Marseilles. It must have been in
the course of the year 1791 when Viola ﬂed from Naples
with her mysterious lover, and when Glyndon sought
Mejnour in the fatal Castle. It is now towards the close
of 1793, when our story again returns to Zanoni. The
stars of winter shone down on the Lagunes of Venice.
The hum of the Rialto was hushed—the last loiterers had
deserted the place of St. Mark’s, and only at distant in-
tervals might be heard the oars of the rapid gondolas,
bearing reveller or lover to his home. But lights still
ﬂitted to and fro across the windows of one of the Palla

within the Palace watched the twin Eumenides, that never
sleep for Man,--Fear and Pain.
" I will make thee the richest man in all Venice, if thou
savest her.”
“Signor,” said the Leech, “your gold cannot control
death, and the will of Heaven—Signor, unless within the
next hour there is some blessed change, prepare your
courage.”
Ho—ho, Zanoni 1 man of mystery and might, who hast
walked amidst the passions of the world, with no changes
on thy brow, art thou tossed at last upon the billows of
tempestuous fear ?— Does thy spirit reel to and fro ? —-
knowest thou at last the strength and the majesty of
Death ?

At length the ﬂame quivers—the air grows cold as the
wind in charnels. -A thing not of earth is present—a
mist-like formless thing. It cowers in the distance- a
silent Horror 1 it rises—it creeps—it nears thee—dark in
its mantle of dusky haze ; and under its veil it looks on
thee with its livid, malignant eyes—the thing of malignant
eyes 1
“Ha, young Chaldaaanl young in thy countless ages

stoodest on the old Fire-tower, and heardest the starry

noni heard distinctly in his heart, even at that distance
from the chamber, the voice of Viola, calling in delirium
on her beloved one.
“ Oh, Viola, I can save thee not ! ” exclaimed the Seer,
passionately ; “my love for thee has made me powerless ! ”
“ Not powerless; I can gift thee with the art to save
her—I can place healing in thy hand!”
“ For both? child and mother—for both ? ”

In the dark chamber lay Viola, in the sharpest agonies
of travail; life seemed rending itself away in the groans
and cries that spoke of pain in the midst of frenzy ; and
still, in groan and cry, she called on Zanoni, her beloved.
The physician looked to the clock; on it beat—the Heart
of Time,- regularly and slowly—Heart that never sym-
pathised with Life, and never ﬂagged for Death! “ The
cries are fainter,” said the leech ; “in ten minutes more,
all will be past.”
Fool! the minutes laugh at thee; Nature even now,

calm and hushed—the voice of delirium is dumb-a
sweet dream has come to Viola. Is it a dream, or is it
the soul that sees ? She thinks suddenly that she is with
Zanoni, that her burning head is pillowed on his bosom;
she thinks as he gazes on her, that his eyes dispel the
tortures that prey upon her—the touch of his hand cools
the fever on her brow; she hears his voice in murmurs
—it is a music from which the ﬁends ﬂy. Where is the
mountain that seemed to press upon her temples? Like
a vapor, it rolls away. In the frosts of the winter night,
she sees the sun laughing in luxurious heaven —— she hears
the whisper of green leaves; the beautiful world, valley,
and stream, and woodland, lie before, and with a common
voice speak to her—“ We are not yet past for thee l”
Fool of drugs and formula, look to thy dial-plate l—the
hand has moved on ; the minutes are with Eternity; the
soul thy sentence would have dismissed, still dwells on the
shores of Time. She sleeps; the fever abates; the con-
vulsions are gone ; the living rose blooms upon her cheek;

Viola recovered with a rapidity that startled the phy-
sician: and the young stranger thrived as if it already
loved the world to which it had descended. From that
hour Zanoni seemed to live in the infant’s life; and in
that life the souls of mother and father met as in a new
bond. Nothing more beautiful than this infant had eye

ever dwelt upon. It was strange to the nurses that it
came not wailing to the light, but smiled to the light as
a thing familiar to it before. It never uttered one cry of
childish pain. In its very repose it seemed to be listening
to some happy voice within its heart: it seemed itself so
happy. In its eyes you would have thought intellect
already kindled, though it had not yet found a language.
Already it seemed to recognize its parents; already it
stretched forth its arms when Zanoni bent over the bed
in which it breathed and bloomed,—- the budding ﬂower!
And from that bed he was rarely absent: gazing upon it
with his serene, delighted eyes, his soul seemed to feed its
own. At night and in utter darkness he was still there;
and Viola often heard him murmuring over it as she lay
in a half-sleep. But the murmur was in alanguage strange
to her ; and sometimes when she heard, she feared, and.
vague, undeﬁned superstitions came back to her—the
superstitions of earlier youth. A mother fears everything,
even the gods, for her new-born. The mortals shrieked.
aloud, when of old they'saw the great Demeter seeking
to make their child immortal!
But Zanoni, wrapt in the sublime designs that animated
the human love to which he was now awakened, forgot all,
even all he had forfeited or incurred, in the love that
blinded him.
But the dark, formless thing, though he nor invoked
nor saw it, crept, often, round and round him: and often
sat by the infant’s couch, with its hateful eyes.

MEJNOUR, Humanity, with all its sorrows and its joys,

fetters. I live in other lives than my own, and in them I
have lost more than half my empire. Not lifting them
aloft, they drag me by the strong bands of the affections
to their own earth. Exiled from the beings only visible
to the most abstract sense, the grim Enemy that guards
the Threshold has entangled me in its web. Canst thou

spirit, the ordeal has no terror and no peril. Thus un-

seen degrees, will communicate its own attributes to the
mother; and content to see Youth for ever radiant on
the brows of the two that now sufﬁce to ﬁll up my whole
inﬁnity of thought, shall I regret the airier kingdom that
vanishes hourly from my grasp? But thou, whose vision
is still clear and serene, look into the far deeps shut from
my gaze, and counsel me, or forewarn ! I know that the
gifts of the Being whose race is so hostile to our own,
are, to the common seeker, fatal and perﬁdious as itself.
And hence, when, at the outskirts of knowledge, which
in earlier ages men called Magic, they encountered the
things of the hostile tribes, they believed the apparitions
to be ﬁends, and, by fancied compacts, imagined they had
signed away their souls; as if man could give for an eter-
nity that over which he has control but while he lives!
Dark, and shrouded for ever from human sight, dwell the
daemon rebels, in their impenetrable realm ; in them is no
breath of the Divine One. In every human creature the
Divine One breathes; and He alone canjudge His own
hereafter and allot its new career and home. Could man
sell himself to the ﬁend, man could prejudge himself, and
arrogate the disposal of eternity! But these creatures,
modiﬁcations as they are of matter, and some with more
than the malignity of man, may well seem, to fear and
unreasoning superstition, the representatives of ﬁends.
And from the darkest and mightiest of them I have ac-
cepted a boon-the secret that startled Death from those
so dear to me. Can I not trust that enough of power

FOR the ﬁrst time since their union, Zanoni and Viola
were separated—Zanoni went to Rome on important
business. .“ It was,” he said, “ but for a few days : ” and
he went so suddenly that there was little time either for
surprise or sorrow. But ﬁrst parting is always more mel-
ancholy than it need be; it seems an interruption to the
existence which Love shares with Love; it makes the
heart feel what a void life will be when the last parting
shall succeed, as succeed it must, the ﬁrst. But Viola had
a new companion : she was enjoying that most delicious
novelty which ever renews the youth and dazzles the eyes
of woman. As the mistress—the wife—she leans on
another; from another are reﬂected her happiness, her
being—as an orb that takes light from its sun. But now,
in turn, as the mother, she is raised from dependence into
power ; it is another that leans on her—a star has sprung
into space, to which she herself has become the sun 1

A few days—but they will be sweet through the sor-

the infant, over whom bend watchful the eyes and the
heart. From its waking to its sleep, from its sleep to its
waking, is a revolution in Time. Every gesture to be
noted—every smile to seem a new progress into the world

By the bridge of the Rialto stood two Venetians—
ardent Republicans and Democrats—looking to the Rev-
olution of France as the earthquake which must shatter
their own expiring and vicious constitution, and give
equality of ranks and rights to Venice.
“Yes, Cottalto,” said one; “ my correspondent of Paris
has promised to elude all obstacles, and baﬂle all danger.
He will arrange with us the hour of revolt, when the le-
gions of France shall be within hearing of our guns. One
day in this week, at this hour, he is to meet me here.
This is but the fourth day.”

“His house, his address—quick l” interrupted the man.
“ The Palazzo di——, on the Grand Canal.”
“I thank you-at nine we meet.”
The man hurried on through the street from which he
had emerged; and, passing by the house in which he had
taken up his lodging (he had arrived at Venice the night
before), a woman who stood by the door caught his arm.
“ Ilfonst'eur,” she said, in French, “I have been watch-
ing for your return. Do you understand me? I will
brave all, risk all, to go back with you to France—t0
stand, through life or in death, by my husband’s side 1”
“ Ottoyenne, I promised your husband that, if such
your choice, I would hazard my own safety to aid it. But

you know by his letter) as your husband bade me.”
“Monsieur, I will return with you,” said the woman,
with a smile upon her pale face.
“And yet you deserted your husband in the fair sunshine
of the Revolution, to return to him amidst its storms and
thunder,” said the man, in a tone half of wonder, half .
rebuke.

“Be it so, citoyenne; on the third night I depart.

“Never!”
A dark smile passed over the man’s face.

turned the eyes of many a gallant cavalier, as their gon

But at last, in the centre of the canal, one of these dark

lattice upon that stately palace. He gave the word to

the rowers—the vessel approached the marge. The
stranger quitted the gondola; he passed up the broad
stairs ; he entered the palace. Weep on, smile ,no more,
young mother ! -the last page is turned l
An attendant entered the room, and gave Viola a card,
with these words in English —“ Viola, I must see youl
Clarence Glyndon.”
Oh, yes, how gladly Viola would see him l—how gladly
speak to him of her happiness—of Zanoni l—how gladly
show to him her child 1 Poor Clarence! she had forgot-
ten him till now, as she had all the fever of her earlier
life—its dreams, its vanities, its poor excitement, the
lamps of the gaudy theatre, the applause of the noisy
crowd.
He entered. She started to behold him, so changed
were his gloomy brow, his resolute, care-worn features,
from the graceful form and careless countenance of the
artist-lover. His dress, though not mean, was rude,
neglected, and disordered. A wild, desperate, half-sav-
age air had supplanted that ingenuous mien, diﬂident in
its grace, earnest in its diﬁidence,— which had once char-
acterized the young worshipper of Art, the dreaming
aspirant after some starrier lore.
“Is it you ?” she said, at last. “ Poor Clarence, how
changed l” '
“Changed 1” he said, abruptly, as he placed himself by
her side. “And whom am I to thank, but the ﬁends——
the sorcerers—who have seized upon thy existence, as
upon mine? Viola, hear me. A few weeks since, the

pretences, and through innumerable dangers, I have come
hither, risking liberty, perhaps life, if my name and career
are known in Venice, to warn and save you. Changed,
you call me l—changed without; but what is that to the
ravages within ? Be warned, be warned in time l”
The voice of Glyndon, sounding hollow and sepulchral,
alarmed Viola even more than his words. Pale, haggard,
emaciated, he seemed almost as one risen from the dead,
to appal and awe her. “What,” she said, at last, in a
faltering voice, “what wild words do you utter! Can

“ Listen I ” interrupted Glyndon, laying his hand upon
her arm, and its touch was as cold as death —“listen!
You have heard of the old stories of men who have
leagued themselves with devils for the attainment of pre-
ternatural powers. Those stories are not fables. Such
men live. Their delight is to increase the unhallowed
circle of wretches like themselves. If their proselytes
fail in the ordeal, the daemon seizes them, even in this life,

charm the evil one, or allay the torture. I have come
from a seene where blood ﬂows in rivers—where Death

with which men can be beset, are nothing to the dreariness
of a chamber where the Horror that passes death moves
and stirs l ”

It was then that Glyndon, with a cold and distinct pre-
cision, detailed, as he had done to Adela, the initiation
through which he had gone. He described, in words that
froze the blood of his listener, the appearance of that
formless phantom, with the eyes that seared the brain
and congealed the marrow of those who beheld. Once
seen, it never was to be exorcised. It came at its own
will, prompting black thoughts -_ whispering strange
temptations. Only in scenes of turbulent excitement was
it absent l Solitude — serenity—the struggling desires
after peace and virtue —these were the elements it loved
to hauntl Bewildered, terror-stricken, the wild account
conﬁrmed by the dim impressions that never, in the depth
and conﬁdence of affection, had been closely examined,
but rather banished as soon as felt—that the life and
attributes of Zanoni were not like those of mortals-
impressions which her own love had made her hitherto
censure, as suspicions that wronged, and which, thus
mitigated, had perhaps only served to rivet the fascinated
chains in which he bound her heart and senses, but which
now, as Glyndon’s awful narrative ﬁlled her with con-
tagious dread, half-unbound the very spells they had woven
before—Viola started up in fear—not for herself; and
clasped her child in her armsl
“Unhappiest one l ” cried Glyndon, shuddering, “hast
thou indeed given birth to a victim thou canst not save?
Refuse it sustenance—let it look to thee in vain for food I
In the grave, at least, there are repose and peace 1 ”

Then tnere came back to Viola’s mind the remembrance
of Zanoni’s night~long watches by that cradle, and the
fear which even then had crept over her as she heard his
murmured half-chanted words. And as the child looked
at her with its clear, steadfast eye, in the strange intelli-
gence of that look there was something that only con-
ﬁrmed her awe. So there both Mother and Forewarner
stood in silence—the sun smiling upon them through the
casement, and dark by the cradle, though they saw it not,
sat the motionless, veiled Thing! '
But by degrees better, and juster, and more grateful
memories of the past returned to the young mother. The
features of the infant, as she gazed, took the aspect of
the absent father. A voice seemed to break from those
r0sy lips, and say, mournfully— “I speak to thee in thy
child. In return for all my love for thee and thine, dost
thou distrust me, at the ﬁrst sentence of a maniac who
accuses f”
Her breast heaved—her stature rose—her eyes shone
with a serene and holy light.
“ Go, poor victim of thine own delusions,” she said to
Glyndon; “ I would not believe mine own senses, if they
accused its father I And what knowest thou of Zanoni I
What relation have Mejnour and the grisly spectres he
invoked, with the radiant image with which thou wouldst
connect them I ”
“ Thou wilt learn too soon,” replied Glyndon, gloomily.
“And the very phantom that haunts me, whispers, with

its bloodless lips, that its horrors await both thine and
thee ! I take not thy decision yet; before I leave Venice
we shall meet again.”
He said, and departed.
CHAPTER VI.

LA Ham's, Le Comte de Warwick, Act 4, so. 4.
ALAS, Zanoni! the Aspirer, the dark bright one!-—-
didst thou think that the bond between the-survivor of
ages and the daughter of a day could endure? Didst
thou not foresee that, until the ordeal was past, there
could be no equality between thy wisdom and her love?
Art thou absent now, seeking amidst thy solemn secrets,
the solemn safeguards for child and mother, and forgettest
thou that the phantom that scrved thee hath power over
its own gifts—over the lives it taught thee to rescue from
the grave? Dost thou not know that Fear and Distrust,
once sown in the heart of Love, spring up from the seed
into a forest that excludes the stars ? Dark bright one !
the hateful eyes glare beside the mother and the child !
All that day Viola was distracted by a thousand thoughts
and terrors, which ﬂed as she examined them, to settle

back the darklier. She remembered-that, as she had once
said to Glyndon, her very childhood had been haunted
with strange forebodings, that she was ordained for some
preteruatural doom. She remembered that, as she had
told him this, sitting by the seas that slumbered in the
arms of the Bay of Naples, he, too, had acknowledged
the same forebodings, and a mysterious sympathy had
appeared to unite their fates. She remembered, above
all, that comparing their entangled thoughts, both had
then said that with the ﬁrst sight of Zanoni the foreboding,
the instinct, had spoken to their hearts more audibly than
before, whispering, that “ with HIM was connected the
secret of the unconjectured life.”
And now, when Glyndon and Viola met again, the
haunting fears of childhood, thus referred to, woke from
their enchanted sleep. With Glyndon’s terror she felt a
sympathy, against which her reason and her love struggled
in vain. And still, when she turned her looks upon her
child, it watched her with that steady, earnest eye, and
its lips moved as if it sought to speak to her; _bnt no
sound came. The infant refused to sleep. Whenever she
gazed upon its face, still those wakeful, watchful eyes !—
and in their earnestness, there spoke something of pain,
of upbraiding, of accusation. They chilled her as she
looked. Unable to endure, of herself, this sudden and
complete revulsion of all the feelings which had hitherto
made up her life, she formed the resolution natural to her
land and creed ; she sent for the priest who had habitually

attended her at Venice, and to him she confessed, with
passionate sobs and intense terror, the doubts that had
broken upon her. The good father, a worthy and pious
man, but with little education and less sense, one who
held, (as- many of the lower Italians do to this day) even
a poet to be a sort of sorcerer, seemed to shut the gates
of hope upon her heart. His remonstrances were urgent,
for his horror was unfeigned. He joined with Glyndon
in imploring her to ﬂy, if she felt the smallest doubt that
her husband’s pursuits were of the nature which the
Roman church had benevolently burned so many scholars
for adopting, And even the little that Viola could com-
municate, seemed to the ignorant ascetic irrefragable
proof of sorcery and witchcraft: he had, indeed, previously
heard some of the strange rumors which followed the
path of Zanoni, and was therefore prepared to believe
the worst; the worthy Bartolomeo would have made no
bones of sending Watt to the stake, had he heard him
speak of the steam-engine! But Viola, as untutored as
himself, was terriﬁed by his rough_ and vehement e10-
quence; terriﬁed, for by that penetration which Catholic
priests, however dull, generally acquire, in their vast ex-
perience of the human heart hourly exposed to their
probe, Bartoloméo spoke less of danger to herself than
to her child. “Sorcerers,” said he, “have ever sought
the most to decoy and seduce the souls of the young-
nay, the infant;” and therewith he entered into along
catalogue of legendary fables which he quoted as his-

torical facts. All at which an English woman would have
smiled, appalled the tender but superstitions Neapolitan ;
and when the priest- left her, with solemn rebukes and
grave accusations of a dereliction of her duties to her
child, if she hesitated to ﬂy with it from an abode polluted
by the darker powers and unhallowed arts, Viola, still
clinging to the image of Zanoni, sunk into a passive
lethargy, which held her very reason in suspense.
The hours passed; night came on; the house was
hushed; and Viola, slowly awakened from the numbness
and torpor which had usurped her faculties, tossed to
and fro on her couch, restless and perturbed. The still-
ness became intolerable; yet more intolerable the sound
that alone broke it, the voice of the clock, knelling
moment after 'moment to its grave. The Moments, at
last, seemed themselves to ﬁnd voice—t0 gain shape.
She thought she beheld them springing, wan and fairy-
like, from the womb of darkness; and ere they fell again,
extinguished, into that womb, their grave, their low small
voices murmured—“Woman ! we report to eternity all
that is done in time! What shall we report of thee, O
guardian of a new-born soul?” She became sensible that
her fancies had brought a sort of partial delirium, that
she was in a state between sleep and waking, when sud-
denly one thought became more predominant than the
rest. The chamber which, in that and every house they
had inhabited, even that in the Greek isles, Zanoni had
set apart to a solitude on which none might intrude, the

threshold of which even Viola’s step was forbid to cross,
and never, hitherto, in that sweet repose of conﬁdence
which belongs to cemented love, had she even felt the
curious desire to disobey— now, that chamber drew her
towards it. Perhaps, there, might be found a somewhat
to solve the riddle, to dispel or conﬁrm the doubt: that
thought grew and deepened in its intenseness ; it fastened
on her as with a palpable and irresistible grasp ; it seemed
to raise her limbs without her will.
And now, through the chamber, along the galleries
thou glidest, O lovely shape l sleep-walking, yet awake.
The moon shines on thee as thou glidest by, casement
after casement, white-robed and wandering spirit l-thine
arms crossed upon thy bosom, thine eyes ﬁxed and open,
with a calm, unfearing awe. Mother! it is thy child that
leads thee on. The fairy moments go before thee. Thou
hearest still the clock-knell tolling them to their graves
behind. On, gliding on, thou hast gained the door; no
lock bars thee, no magic spell drives thee back. Daughter
of the dust, thou standest alone‘with Night in the chamber
where, pale and numberless, the hosts of space hava
gathered round the seer!

SHE stood within the chamber, and gazed around her;
no signs by which an Inquisitor of old could have detected
the Scholar of the Black Art were visible. No crucibles
and caldrons, no brass-bound volumes and ciphered girdles,
no skulls and cross-bones. Quietly streamed the broad
moon-light through the desolate chamber with its bare
white walls. A few bunches of withered herbs, a few
antique vessels of bronze, placed carelessly on a wooden
form, were all which that curious gaze could identify with
the pursuits of the absent owner. The magic, if it existed,
dwelt in the artiﬁcer, and the materials, to other hands,
were but herbs and bronze. So is it ever with thy works
and wonders, O Genius— Seeker of the Stars! Words
themselves are the common property of all men ; yet, from

invoked its wonders left no enchantment of its own? It
seemed so; for as Viola stood in the chamber, she became
sensible that some mysterious change was at work within
herself. Her blood coursed rapidly, and with a sensation
of delight, through her veins— she felt as if chains were
falling from her limbs, as if cloud after cloud was rolling
from her gaze. All the confused thoughts which had
moved through her trance, settled and centred themselves
in one intense desire to see the Absent One—to be with
him. The monads that make up space and air seemed
charged with a spiritual attraction—t0 become a medium
through which her spirit could pass from its clay, and
confer with the spirit to which the unutterable desire
compelled it. A faintness seized her; she tottered to the
seat on which the vessels and herbs were placed, and, as
she bent down, she saw in one of the vessels a small vase
of crystal. By a mechanical and involuntary impulse,
her hand seized the vase; she opened it, and the volatile
essence it contained sparkled up, and spread through the
room a powerful and delicious fragrance. She inhaled
the odor, she laved her temples with the liquid, and sud-
denly her life seemed to spring up from the previous
faintness- to spring, to soar, to ﬂoat, to dilate upon the
wings of a. bird.
The room vanished from her eyes. Away—away, over
lands, and seas, and space, on the rushing desires ﬂies the

throw off as they roll round the Creator’s throne,* to
become themselves new worlds of symmetry and glory—-
planets and suns, that for ever and for ever shall in their
turn multiply their shining race, and be the fathers of
suns and planets yet to come.
There, in that enormous solitude of an infant world,
which thousands and thousands of years can alone ripen
into form, the spirit of Viola beheld the shape of Zanoni,
or rather the likeness, the simulacrum, the LEMUB of his
shape, not its human and corporeal substance—as if, like

* “Astronomy instructs us, that in the original condition of the
solar system, the sun was the nucleus of a nebulosity or luminous
mass, which revolved on its axis, and extended far beyond the
orLits of all the planets; the planets as yet having no existence.
Its temperature gradually diminished, and becoming contracted by
cooling, the rotation increased in rapidity, and zones of nebulosity
were successively thrown 08‘, in consequence of the centrifugal
force overpowering the central attraction. The condensation of
these separate masses constituted the planets and satellites. But
this view of the conversion of gaseous matter into planetary bodies
is not limited to our own system; it extends to the formation of
the innumerable suns and worlds which are distributed throughout
the universe. The sublime discoveries of modern astronomers have
shown that every part of the realms of space abounds in large
expansions of attenuated matter termed nebulae, which are irregu-

hers, the Intelligence was parted from the Clay : —- and
as the sun, while it revolves and glows, had cast off into
remotest space that Nebular image of itself, so the thing
of earth, in the action of its more luminous and enduring
being, had thrown its likeness into that new-born stranger
of the heavens. There stood the phantom—a phantom
Mejnour, by its side. In the gigantic chaos around raved
and struggled the kindling elements— water and ﬁre,
darkness and light, at war—vapor and cloud hardening
into mountains, and the Breath of Life moving like a
steadfast splendor over all!
As the dreamer looked, and shivered, she beheld that
even there the two phantoms of humanity were not alone.
Dim monster-forms that that disordered chaos alone could
engender, the ﬁrst reptile Colossal race that wreathe and
crawl through the earliest stratum of a world laboring
into life, coiled in the oozing matter or hovered through
the meteorous vapors. But these the two seekers seemed
not to heed; their gaze was ﬁxed intent'upon an object
in the farthest space. With the eyes of the spirit, Viola
followed theirs; with a terror far greater than the chaos
and its hideous inhabitants produced, she beheld a shadowy
likeness of the very room in which her form yet dwelt,
its white walls, the moonshine sleeping on its ﬂoor, its
open casement, with the quiet roofs and domes of Venice
looming over the sea that sighed below;-—and in that
room the ghost-like image of herself! This double phan-
tom— here herself a phantom—gazing there upon a.

open as the scene ofa theatre. A grim dungeon—streets
through which pour shadowy crowds—wrath and hatred,
and the aspect of daemons in their ghastly visages—a
place of death—a murderous instrument—a shamble-
house of human ﬁesh—herself— her child—all, all, rapid
phantasmagoria, chased each other. Suddenly the phan-
tom-Zanoni turned, it seemed to perceive herself—her
second self. It sprang towards her; her spirit could bear
no more. She. shrieked,‘she woke. She found that in

soul! Pardon, pardon, if my words wrong thee. See,
I fall on my knees to write the rest!
“Why did I never recoil before from thy mysterious
lore ? - why did the very strangeness of thine unearthly
life only fascinate me with a delightful fear? Because, if
thou wert sorcerer 0r angel-daemon, there was no peril to
other but myself: and none to me, for my love was my
heavenliest part; and my ignorance in all things, except
the art to love thee, repelled every thought that was not
bright and glorious as thine image to my eyes. But Now
there is another! Look! why does it watch me thus —
why that never-sleeping, earnest, rebuking gaze? Have
thy spells encompassed it already? Hast thou marked it,
cruel one, for the terrors of thy unutterable art? Do not
madden me—do not madden me l—unbind the spell !

mother !’ A mother l—yes, I rise from my knees—I am
a mother! They come! I am ﬁrm; farewell!”
Yes; thus suddenly, thus cruelly, whether in the de-
lirium of blind and unreasoning superstition, or in the
resolve of that conviction which springs from duty, the
being for whom he had resigned so much of empire and
of glory forsook Zanoni. This desertion, never foreseen,
never anticipated, was yet but the constant fate that at-
tends those who would place Mind beyond the earth, and
yet treasure the Heart within it. Ignorance everlastiugly
shall recoil from knowledge. But never yet, from nobler
and purer motives of self-sacriﬁce, did human love link
itself to another, than did the forsaking wife now abandon
the absent. For rightly had she said, that it was not the
faithless wife, it was the faithful mother that ﬂed from all
in which her earthly happiness was centred.
As long as the passion and fervor that impelled the
act animated her with false fever, she clasped her infant
to her breast, and was consoled—resigned. But what
bitter doubt of her own conduct, what icy pang of remorse
shot through her heart, when, as they rested for a few
hours on the road to Leghorn, she heard the woman who
accompanied herself and Glyndon pray for safety to reach
her husband’s side, and strength to share the perils that
would meet her there ! Terrible contrast to her own de-
sertiou ! She shrunk into the darkness of her own heart,
-—and then no voice from within consoled her.

It is the Reign of Terror, with Robespierre the king.
The struggles between the boa and the lion are past; the
boa has consumed the lion, and is heavy with the gorge;
—Danton has fallen,_aud Camille Desmoulins. Danton
had said before his death, “The poltroon Robespierre —-
I alone could have saved him.” From that hour, indeed,
the blood of the dead giant clouded the craft of “ Max-
imilien the Incorruptible,” as at last, amidst the din of
the roused Convention, it choked his voice.* If, after
that last sacriﬁce, essential, perhaps, to his safety, Robes-
pierre had proclaimed the close of the Reign of Terror,
and acted upon the mercy which Danton had begun to
preach, he might have lived and died a monarch. But
the prisons continued to reek—the glaive to fall; and
Robespierre perceived not that his mobs were glutted to
satiety with death, and the strongest excitement a chief
could give would be a return from devils into men.
We are transported to a room in the house of Citizen
Dupleix, the ménuisier, in the month of July, 1794; or,
in the calendar of the Revolutionists, it was the Thermidor
oft he Second Year of the Republic, One and Indivisible !
Though the room was small, it was furnished and decor-
ated with a minute and careful effort at elegance and
reﬁnement. It seemed, indeed, the desire of the owner
to avoid at once what was mean and rude, and what was

* “Le sang de Danton t’étoutfel” (the blood of Danton chokes
thee!) said Gurnier de l’Aube, when, on the fatal 9th of Thermidor,
Robespierre gaSped feebly forth—“ Pour In derniere fois, President
des Assassins, je te demande la parole.” (For the last time, Presi-
dent of Assassins, I demand to speak.)

luxuri )us and voluptuous. It was a trim, orderly, precise
grace that shaped the classic chairs, arranged the ample
draperies, sunk the frameless mirrors into the wall, placed
bust and bronze on their pedestals, and ﬁlled up the niches
here and there with well-bound books, ﬁlled regularly in
their appointed ranks. An observer would have said,
“This man wishes to imply to you—I am not rich; I
am not ostentatious; I am not luxurious; I am no indo-
lent Sybarite, with couches of down, and pictures that
provoke the sense; I am no haughty noble, with spacious
halls, and galleries that awe the echo. But so much the
greater is my merit if I disdain these excesses of the ease
or the pride, since I love the elegant, and have a taste !
Others may be simple and honest, from the very coarseness
of their habits; if I, with so much reﬁnement and delicacy,
am simple and honest,_ reﬂect and admire me!”
On the walls of this chamber hung many portraits, most
of them represented but one face ; on the formal pedestals
were grouped many busts; most of them sculptured but
one head. In that small chamber Egotism sat supreme,
and made the Arts its looking-glasses. Erect in a chair,
before a large table spread with letters, sat the original
of bust and canvas, the owner of the apartment. He was
alone, yet he sat erect, formal, stiﬁ', precise, as if in his
‘ very home he was not at ease. His dress was in harmony
with his posture and his chamber, it affected a neatness
of its own—foreign both to the sumptuous fashions of
the deposed nobles, and the ﬁlthy ruggedness of the sans-
culottes. Frizzled and cozﬁ‘é, not a hair was out of order,

not a speck lodged on the sleek surface of the blue coat,
not a wrinkle crumpled the snowy vest, with its under-
relief of delicate pink. At the ﬁrst glance, you might
have seen in that face nothing but the ill-favored features
of a sickly countenance. At a second glance, you would
have perceived that it had a power—a character of its
own. The forehead, though low and compressed, was not
without that appearance of thought and intelligence which,
it may be observed, that breadth between the eyebrows
almost invariably gives; the lips were ﬁrm and tightly
drawn together, yet ever and anon they trembled, and
writhed restlessly. The eyes, sullen and gloomy, were
yet piercing, and full of a concentrated vigor, that did
not seem supported by the thin, feeble frame, or the green
lividness of the hues, which told of anxiety and disease.
Such was Maximilien Robespierre; such the chamber
over the ménuz's'ier’s shop, whence issued the edicts that
launched armies on their career -of glory, and ordained an
artiﬁcial conduit to carry off the blood that deluged the
metropolis of the most martial people on the globe ! Such
was the man who had resigned a judicial appointment
(the early object of his ambition), rather than violate his
philanthropical principles, by subscribing to the death of
a single fellow-creature 1 -such was the virgin enemy to
capital punishments, and such, Butcher-Dictator now, was
the man whose pure and rigid manners, whose incorrupt-
ible honesty, whose hatred of the excesses that tempt to
love and wine, would—had he died ﬁve years earlier-
have left him the model for prudent fathers and careful

citizens to place before their sons. Such was the man
who seemed to have no vice, till circumstance, that hot-
bed, brought forth the two which, in ordinary times, lie
ever the deepest and most latent in a man’s heart— Cow,
ardice and Envy. To one of these sources is to be traced
every murder that master-ﬁend committed. His cowardice
was of a peculiar and strange sort; for it was accompanied
with the most unscrupulous and determined will-a will
that Napoleon reverenced,— a will of iron, and yet nerves
of aspen. Mentally, he was a hero—physically, a dastard.
When the veriest shadow of danger threatened his person,
the frame cowered, but the will swept the danger to the
slaughter-house. So there he sat, bolt upright—his
small, lean ﬁngers clenched convulsively - his sullen eyes
straining into space, their whites yellowed with streaks of
corrupt blood, his ears literally moving to and fro, like
the ignoble animal’s, to catch every sound—a Dionysins
in his cave,-— but his posture decorous and collected, and
every formal hair in its frizzled place.
“ Yes, yes,” he said, in a muttered tone, “ I hear them;
my good Jacobins are at their post on the stairs. Pity
they swear so i I have a law against oaths—the manners
of the poor and virtuous people must be reformed. When

up a volume; he seemed absorbed in its contents, as a
tall fellow, a bludgeon in his hand, a girdle, adorned with
pistols, round his waist, opened the door, and announced
two visitors. The one was a young man, said to resemble
Robespierre in person; but of a far more decided and
resolute expression of countenance. He entered ﬁrst, and
looking over the volume in Robespierre’s hand, for the
latter seemed still intent on his lecture, exclaimed—
“ What! Rousseau’s Heloise? A love-tale l”
“ Dear Payan, it is not the love—it is the philosophy
that charms me. What noble sentiments ! - what rank!
of virtue! If Jean Jacques had but lived to see this
day ! ”
While the Dictator thus commented on his favorite
author, whom in his orations he labored hard to imitate,
the second visitor was wheeled into the room in a chair.
This man was also in what, to most, is the prime of life—
viz., about thirty-eight; but he was literally dead in the
lower limbs: crippled, paralytic, distorted, he was yet, as
the time soon came to tell him—a Hercules in Crime!
But the sweetest of human smiles dwelt upon his lips, a
beauty almost angelic characterized his features;* an

* “ Figure (1' Ange,” says one of his contemporaries, in describing
Couthon'. The address, drawn up most probably by Payan (Ther-
midor 9), after the arrest of Robespierre, thus mentions his crippled
colleague —“ Couthon, ce citoyeu vertueux, qui n’a que le new et la
llte de vivans, mais qui les a brﬁlauts de patriotisme." (a)

inexpressible aspect of kindness, and the resignation of
suﬁ'ering but cheerful benignity, stole into the hearts of
those who for the ﬁrst time beheld him. With the most
caressing, silver, ﬂute-like voice, Citizen Couthon saluted
the admirer of Jean Jacques.
“ N ay—do not say it is not the love that attracts thee;
it is the love l but not the gross, sensual attachment of
man for woman. No l the sublime affection for the whole
human race, and, indeed, for all that lives l”
And Citizen Couthon, bending down, fondled the little
spaniel that he invariably carried in his bosom, even to
the Convention, as a vent for the exuberant sensibilities
which overﬂowed his aﬂ'ectionate heart.*
“Yes, for all that lives,” repeated Robespierre, ten-
derly. “Good Couthon—poor Couthon ! Ah, the malice
of men l—how we are misrepresented ! To be calumniated
as the executioners of our colleagues! Ah, it is that

* This tenderness for some pet animal was by no means peculiar
to Couthon; it seems rather a common fashion with the gentle
butchers of the Revolution. M. George Duval informs us (“Sou-
venirs de la Terreur," vol. iii. p. 183), that Chaumette had an aviary,
to which he devoted his harmless leisure; the murderous Fouruier
carried, on his shoulders, a pretty little squirrel, attached by a silver
chain; Panis bestowed the superﬂuity of his atfections upon two
gold pheasants; and Marat, who would not abate one of the three
hundred thousand heads he demanded, reared doves! Aplopos of
the spaniel of Couthon, Duval gives us an amusing anecdote of
Sergent, not one of the least relentless agents of the massacre of
September. A lady came to implore his protection for one of her
relations conﬁned in the Abbaye. He scarcely deigned to speak to
her. As she retired in despair, she trod by accident on the paw of
his favorite spaniel. Sergent, turning round, enraged and furious,
exclaimed —“Madam, have you no humanity !”

which pierces the heart! To be an object of terror to
the enemies of our country-that is noble; but to be an
object of terror to the good, the patriotic, to those one
loves and reveres—that is the most terrible of human
tortures; at least to a susceptible and honest heart ! ” *
‘5 How I love to hear him ! " ejaculated Conthon.
“Hem i” said Payan, with some impatience. “But
now to business!”
“Ah, to business!” said Robespierre, with a sinister
glance from his bloodshot eyes.
“The time has come,” said Payan, “ when the safety
of the Republic demands a complete concentration of its
power. These brawlers of the Comité du Salut Public
can only destroy; they cannot construct. They hated
you, Maximilien, from the moment you attempted to
replace anarchy by institutions. How they mock at the

“ Mahomet is coming to the mountain,” said Couthon,
with his silvery accent, as he caressed his spaniel.
“ But how is this? I do not see the name of Tallier. l
Tallien—I hate that man; that is,” said Robespierre,
correcting himself with the hypocrisy or self-deceit which
those who formed the council of this phrase-monger exhib-
ited habitually, even among themselves —“ that is, Virtue

Cenvention who inspires me with the same horror as Tal-
lien. Couthon, I see a thousand Dantons where Tallien
sits l ”
“Tallien has the only head that belongs to this de-
formed body,” said Payan, whose ferocity and crime, like
those of St. Just, were not unaccompanied by talents of
no common order. “Were it not better to draw away
the head, to win, to buy him, for the time, and dispose
of him better when left alone? He may hate you, but
he loves money!”
“No,” said Robespierre, writing down the name of
Jean Lambert Tallien, with a slow hand, that shaped each
letter with stern distinctness ; “that one head is my neces-
sity ! n '
“I have a small list here,” said Couthon, sweetly—
“a very small list. You are dealing with the Mountain ;
it is necessary to make a few examples in the Plain.

They turned against us yesterday in the Convention. A
little terror will correct the weathercocks. Poor creatures I
I owe them no ill-will ; I could weep for them. But be-

The terrible glance of Robespierre devoured the list
which the man of sensibility submitted to him. “Ah, these
are well chosen ; men not of mark enough to be regretted,
which is the best policy with the relics of that party ; some,
foreigners too;— yes, they have no parents in Paris.

“Couthon is right,” said Payan; “ my list contains
those whom it will be safer to dispatch en masse in the
crowd assembled at the Féte. His list selects those whom
we may prudently consign to the law. Shall it not be
signed at once ?”
“It is signed,” said Robespierre, formally replacing his
pen upon the inkstand. “ Now to more important matters.
These deaths will create no excitement; but Gollot d’Her-
hois, Bourdon De l’Oise, Tallieu,”-- the last name Robes-
pierre gasped as he pronounced—“they are the heads of
parties. This is life or death to us as well as them.”
“Their heads are the footstools to your curule chair,”
said Payan, in a half-whisper. “There is no danger if
we are bold. Judges, juries, all have been your selection.
You seize with one hand the army, with the other, the
law. Your voice yet commands the people ”
“The poor and virtuous people,” murmured Robes-
pierre.
“And even,” continued Payan, “if our design at the

Féte fail us, we must not shrink from the resources still at
our command. Reﬂect ! Henriot, the genera! of the
Parisian army, furnishes you with troops to arrest; the
J acobin club with a public to approve; inexorable Dumas
with judges who never acquit. We must be bold ! ”
“And we are bold,” exclaimed Robespierre, with sudden
passion, and striking his hand on the table as he rose,
with his crest erect, as a serpent in the act to strike. “ In
seeing the multitude of vices that the revolutionary torrent
mingles with civic virtues, I tremble to be sullied in the

perverse men, who thrust themselves among the sincere
defenders of humanity. Whatl—they think to divide
the country like a booty l I thank them for their hatred
to all that is virtuous and worthy! These men,”--and
he grasped the list of Payan in his hand -“ these l--not
we-—have drawn the line of demarcation between them-
selves and the lovers of France!”
“True, we must reign alone i” muttered Payan; “1n
other words, the state needs unity of will ;” working, with
his strong practical mind, the corollary from the logic of
his word-compelling colleague!
“ I will go to the Convention,” continued Robespierre.
“ I have absented myself too long-lest I might seem to
overawe the Republic that I have created. Away with
such scruplesl I will prepare the people I I will blast
the traitors with a look!”
He spoke with the terrible ﬁrmness of the orator that
had never failed —of the moral will that marched like a
warrior on the cannon. At that instant he was inter-
rupted; a letter was brought to him: he opened it: his
face fell ——he shook from limb to limb; it was one of the
anonymous warnings by which the hate and revenge of
those yet left alive to threaten tortured the death-giver.
“Thou art smeared,” ran the lines, “ with the best blood

WHILE such were the designs and fears of Maximilien

less bespattered than himself with innocent blood. But
that conspiracy would have been idle of itself, despite the
abilities of Tallien and Barras (the only men whom it
comprised, worthy, by foresight and energy, the names of
“ leaders ”). The sure and destroying elements that
gathered round the tyrant were Time and Nature; the
one, which he no longer suited; the other, which he had
outraged and stirred up in the human breast. The most
atrocious party of the Revolution, the followers of Hebert,
gone to his last account, the butcher-atheists, who, in
desecrating heaven and earth, still arrogated inviolable
sanctity to themselves, were equally enraged at the exe-
cution of their ﬁlthy chief, and the proclamation of a
Supreme Being. The populace, brutal as it had been,
started as from a dream of blood, when their huge idol,
Danton, no longer ﬁlled the stage of terror, rendering
crime popular by that combination of careless frankness
and eloquent energy which endears their heroes to the
herd. The glai've of the guillotine had turned against
themselves. They had yelled and shouted, and sung and
danced, when the venerable age, or the gallant youth, of
aristocracy or letters, passed by their streets in the dismal
tumbrils; but they shut up their shops, and murmured to
each other, when their own order was invaded, and tailors
and cobblers, and journeymen and laborers, were huddled
off to the embraces of the “Holy Mother Guillotine,"
with as little ceremony as if they had been the Moutmo-
reucies or the La Trémouilles, the Malesherbes or the
Lavoisiers. “At this time,” said Oouthon, justly, “Les

Among those who had shared the doctrines, and who
now dreaded the fate of the atheist Hebert, was the
painter, Jean Nicot. Mortiﬁed and enraged to ﬁnd that,
by the death of his patron, his career was closed; and
that, in the zenith of the Revolution for which he had
labored, he was lurking in caves and cellars, more poor,
more obscure, more despicable than he had been at the
commencement—not daring to exercise even his art, and
fearful every hour that his name would swell the lists of
the condemned; he was naturally one of the bitterest
enemies of Robespierre and his government. He held
secret meetings with Collot d’Herbois, who was animated
by the same spirit; and with the creeping and furtive
craft that characterized his abilities, he contrived, unde-
tected, to disseminate tracts and invectives against the
Dictator, and to prepare, amidst “ the poor and virtuous
people,” the train for the grand explosion. But still so
ﬁrm to the eyes, even of profounder politicians than Jean
Nicot, appeared the sullen power of the incorruptible
Maximilien ; so timorous was the movement against him,
that Nicot, in common with many others, placed his hopes
rather in the dagger of the assassin, than the revolt of
the multitude. But N icot, though not actually a coward,
shrunk himself from braving the fate of the martyr; he
had sense enough to see that, though all parties might

rejoice in the assassination, all parties would probably
concur in beheading the assassin. He had not the virtue
to become a Brutus. His object was to inspire a proxy-
Brutus; and in the centre of that inﬂammable population,
this was no improbable hope.
Amongst those loudest and sternest against the reign
uf blood — amongst those most disenchanted of the Revo-
lution - amongst those most appalled by its excesses, was,
as might be expected, the Englishman, Clarence Glyndon.
The wit and accomplishments, the uncertain virtues that
had lighted with ﬁtful gleams the mind of Camille Desmou-
lins, had fascinated Glyndon more than the qualities of
any other agent in the Revolution. And when (for Camille
Desmoulins had a heart, which seemed dead or dormant in
most of his contemporaries) that vivid child of genius
and of error, shocked at the massacre of the Giroudins,
and repentaut of his own eﬂ'orts against them, began to
rouse the serpent malice of Robespierre by new doctrines
of mercy and toleration, Glyndon espoused his views with
his whole strength and soul. Camille Desmoulins perished,
and Glyndon, hopeless at once of his own life and the
cause of humanity, from that time, sought only the occa-
sion of ﬂight from the devouring Golgotha. He had two
lives to heed besides his own ; for them he trembled, and
for them he schemed and plotted the means of escape.
Though Glyndon hated the principles, the party,* and

1‘ None were more opposed to the Hébertists than Camille Des-
moulins and his friends. It is curious and amusing to see these
leaders of the mob, calling the mob “the people,” one day, and

the vices of Nicot, he yet extended to the painter’s penury
the means of subsistence; and Jean Nicot, in return,
designed to exalt Glyndon to that very immortality of a
Brutus, from which he modestly recoiled himself. He
founded his designs on the physical courage, on the wild
and unsettled fancies of the English artist; and on the
vehement hate, and indignant loathing, with which he
openly regarded the government of Maximilieu.
At the same. hour, on the same day in July, in which
Robespierre conferred (as we have seen) with his allies,
two persons were seated in a small room, in one of the
streets leading out of the Rue St. Honoré; the one, a
man, appeared listening impatiently, and with a sullen
brow, to his companion, a woman of singular beauty, but
with a bold and reckless expression, and her face as she
spoke was animated by the passions of a half-savage and
vehement nature.
“ Englishman,” said the woman, “beware—yon know
that, whether in ﬂight or at the place of death, I would
brave all to be by your side—you know that! Speak l ”
“ Well, Fillide; did I ever doubt your ﬁdelity ? ”
“ Doubt it you cannot— betray it you may. You tell
me that in ﬂight you must have a companion besides my-
self, and that companion is a female. It shall not be ! ”
“ Shall not ! ”
“It shall not!" repeated Fillide, ﬁrmly, and folding

the “canaille” the next, according as it suits them. “I know,"
says Camille, “that they (the Hébertists) have all the canaille with
them." (lls out toute la canaille pour eux.)

" her arms across her breast; before Glyndon could reply,
a slight knock at the door was heard, and Nicot opened
the latch and entered.
Fillide sank into her chair, and leaning her face on her
hands, appeared unheeding of the intruder, and of the
conversation that ensued.
“I cannot bid thee good day, Glyndon,” said Nicot,
as in his sans-culoite fashion he strode towards the artist,
his ragged hat on his head, his hands in his pockets, and
the heard of a week’s growth upon his chin—“I cannot
bid thee good day, for while the tyrant lives, evil is every
sun that sheds its beams on France.”
“ It is true ; what then? We have sown the wind, we
must reap the whirlwind.”
“And yet,” said Nicot, apparently not heeding the
reply, and as if musingly to himself, “it is strange to
think that the butcher is as mortal as the butchered-
that his life hangs on as slight a thread — that between
the cuticle and the heart there is as short a passage—
that, in short, one blow can free France, and redeem man-
kind I”
Glyndon surveyed the speaker with a careless and
haughty scorn, and made no answer .
“And,” proceeded Nicot, “I have sometimes looked
round for the man born for this destiny, and whenever I
have done so, my steps have led me hither!”
“ Should they not rather have led thee to the side of
Maximilien Robespierre ?” said Glyndon, with a sneer.
“No,” returned Nicot, coldly —“ no; for I am a ‘sus-

tower, to a war between Humanity and the Tyrant, and I
will not be the last in the ﬁeld; but liberty never yet
acknowledged a defender in a felon.”
There was something so brave and noble in Glyndon’s
voice, mien, and manner, as he thus spoke, that Nicot at
once was silenced; at once he saw that he had misjudged
the man.
“ No,” said Fillide, lifting her face from her hands—
“ no! your friend has a wiser scheme in preparation ; he
would leave you wolves to mangle each other. He is

frowns before me. I know that my hours are numbered ;
I know that the tyrant waits but his time to write my
name in his inexorable list; I know that Rene Dumas,
the judge who never pardons, has, from the ﬁrst, resolved
upon my death. Oh ! Glyndon, by our old friendship-
by our common art—by thy loyal English faith, and good
English heart, let me share thy ﬂight!”
“ If thou wilt, so be it.”
“Thanks l-— my whole life shall thank thee. But how

I can procure thy passport also.”
“ Thy riches, then, are not in assignats?”
“No, I have gold enough for us all."

and the disguises to be aSSumed conformably to the
passports, and then added — “In return for the service I

“ Ah--remember, yes ! — and the lover with whom she

“And from whom she is a fugitive now.”
“Indeed—whatl—I understand. Sacré blast." but
you are a lucky fellow, cher confrére.”
“ Silence, man ! with thy eternal prate of brotherhood
and virtue, thou seemest never to believe in one kindly
action, or one virtuous thought!”
Nicot hit his lip, and replied, sullenly, “Experience is
a great undeceiver. Humph! What service can I do
thee, with regard to the Italian?”
“ I have been accessary to her arrival in this city of
snares and pitfalls. I cannot leave her alone amidst dan-
gers from which neither innocence nor obscurity is a safe-
guard. In your blessed Republic, a good and unsuspected
citizen, who casts a desire on any woman, maid or wife,
has but to say, ‘Be mine, or I denounce you!’—In a
word, Viola must share our ﬂight.”
“What so easy? I see your passports provide for
her.”
“What so easy ! What so difficult? This Fillide —
would that I'had never seen her l—would that I had
never enslaved my soul to my senses! The love of an
uneducated, violent, unprincipled woman, opens with a

of her passions.”
“Aha, I know what such women are ! My wife, Bea-
trice Sacchini, whom I took from Naples, when I failed
with this very Viola, divorced me when my money failed,
and, as the mistress of ajudge, passes me in her carriage
while I crawl through the streets. Plague on her i—but
patience, patience! such is the lot of virtue. Would I
were Robespierre for a day!”
“ Cease _ these I tirades ! ” exclaimed Glyndon, im-
patiently; “and to the point. What would you advise Y”
“Leave your Fillide behind.”
“Leave her to her own ignorance-_-leave her unpro-
tected even by the mind—leave her in the Saturnalia of
Rape and Murderi—No! I have sinned against her
once. But come what may, I will not so basely desert
one who, with all her errors, trusted her fate to my love.”
“You deserted her at Marseilles.”
“True; but I left her in safety, and I did not then
believe her love to be so deep and faithful. I left her
gold, and I imagined she would be easily consoled; but,
since then, we have known danger together! And now

have incurred but for devotion to me l-no, that is im-

wouldst humble me with thy loathed beneﬁts, and who
hast chucked me thine alms as to a beggar? And Fillide,
I love her: and thy gold, I love that more! Puppets, I
move your strings!”
He passed slowly into the chamber where Fillide yet
sat, with gloomy thought on her brow and tears standing
in her dark eyes. She looked up eagerly as the door
opened, and turned from the rugged face of Nicot with
an impatient movement of disappointment.
“Glyndon,” said ‘the painter, drawing a chair to Fil-
lide’s, “has left me to enliven your solitude, fair Italian.
He is not jealous of the ugly Nicot l—ha, hal—yet Nicot
loved thee well once, when his fortunes were more fair.
But enough of such past follies.”
“Your friend, then, has left the house. Whither? Ah!
you look away—you falter—you cannot meet my eyes!
Speak! I implore, I command thee, speak!”
“Enfant! and what dost thou fear?”
“Fearl—yes, alas, I fear ! ” said the Italian; and her
whole frame seemed to shrink into itself as she fell once
more back into her seat.
Then, after a pause, she tossed the long hair from her
eyes, and, starting up abruptly, paced the room with dis-
ordered strides. At length she stopped opposite to Nicot,
laid her hand on his arm, drew him towards an escritoire,
which she unlocked, and opening a well, pointed to the
gold that lay within, and said—“ Thou art poor—thou

lovest money; take what thou wilt, but undeceive me.
Who is this woman whom thy friend visitsf-and does
he love her?”
Nicot’s eyes sparkled, and his hands opened and clenched,
and clenched and opened, as he gazed upon the coins.
But reluctantly resisting the impulse, he said, with an
affected bitterness _“Thinkest thou to bribe me ?—if so,
it cannot be with gold. But what if he does love a rival?
—what if he does betray thee f—what if, wearied by thy
jealousies, he designs in his ﬂight to leave thee behind?
—would such knowledge make thee happier?”
“Yes!” exclaimed the Italian, ﬁercely; “yes, for it
would be happiness to hate and to be avenged 1 Oh,
thou knowest not how sweet is hatred to those who have
really loved.”
“But wilt thou swear, if I reveal to thee the secret,
that thou wilt not betray me—that thou wilt not fall, as
women do, into weak tears and fond reproaches when thy
betrayer returns ? ”
“ Tears—reproaches l-Revenge hides itselfin smiles l ”
“ Thou art a brave creature ! ” said Nicot, almost
admiringly. “ One condition more: thy lover designs to
ﬂy with his new love, to leave thee to thy fate ; if I prove
this to thee, and if I give thee revenge against thy rival,
wilt thou ﬂy with me? I love thee 1—1 will wed thee ! ”
Fillide’s eyes ﬂashed ﬁre; she looked at him with un-
utterable disdain, and was silent.
Nicot felt he had gone too far; and with that know-

ledge of the evil part of our nature, which his own heart
and association with crime had taught him, be resolved
to trust the rest to the passions of the Italian, when raised
to the height to which he was prepared to lead them.
“Pardon me,” he said: “my love made me too pre-
sumptuous; and yet it is only that love -—-my sympathy
for thee, beautiful and betrayed, that can induce me to
wrong, with my revelations, one whom I have regarded
as a brother. I can depend upon thine oath to conceal
all from Glyndon?”
" On my oath, and my wrongs, and my mountain blood i’.’
“Enough ! get thy hat and mantle, and follow me.”
As Fillide left the room, Nicot’s eyes again rested on
the gold; it was much— much more than he had dared
to hope for; and as he peered into the well, ahd opened
the drawers, be perceived a packet 'of letters in the well-
known hand of Camille Desmoulins. He seized—he
opened the packet; his looks brightened as he glanced
over a few sentences. “This would give ﬁfty Glyndons
to the guillotine l” he muttered, and thrust the packet
into his boso'm.

Dos'r thou remember in the old time, when the Beau-
‘tlftll yet dwelt in Greece, how we two, in the vast Athe-
nian Theatre, witnessed the birth of Words as undying as
ourselves? Dost thou remember the thrill of terror that
ran through that mighty audience, when the wild Cas-

relentless god! How ghastly, at the entrance of the
House of Atreus, about to become her tomb—rang out
her exclamations of foreboding woe—“ Dwelling abhorrcd

breathless awe of those assembled thousands, I drew close
to thee, and whispered, “Verily, n0 prophet like the
Poet! This scene of fabled horror comes to me as a
dream, shadowing forth some likeness in my own remoter
future!” As I enter this slaughter-house, that scene
returns to me, and I hearken to the voice of Cassandra
ringing in my ears. A solemn and warning dread gathers

round me, as if I too were come to ﬁnd a grave, and “the
Net of Hades ” had already entangled me in its web!
What dark treasure-houses of vicissitude and woe are our
memories become! What our lives, but the chronicles
of unrelenting Death ! It seems to me as yesterday when
I stood in the streets of this city of the Gaul, as they'
shone with plumed chivalry, and the air rustled with
silken braveries. Young Louis, the monarch and the
lover, was victor of the Tournament at the Carousel ; and
all France felt herself splendid in the splendor of her
gorgeous chief! Now there is neither throne nor altar;
and what is in their stead ? I see it yonder—THE GUILLO-
'rnval It is dismal to stand amidst the ruins of moulder-
ing cities, to startle the serpent and the lizard amidst the
wrecks of Persepolis and Thebes; but more dismal still
to stand as I—the stranger from Empires that have
ceased to be—stand now amidst the yet ghastlier ruins
of Law and Order, the shattering of mankind themselves!
Yet here, even here, Love, the Beautiﬁer, that hath led
my steps, can walk with nnshrinking hope through the
wilderness of Death! Strange is the passion that makes
a world in itself, that individualizesv the One amidst the
Multitude; that, through all the changes of my solemn
life, yet survives, though ambition, and hate, and anger,
are dead; the one solitary angel, hovering over a uni-
verse of tombs on its two tremulous and human wings-
Hope and Fear!
How is it, Mejnour, that, as my diviner art abandoned
me--— as, in my search for Viola, I was aided but by the

ordinary instincts of the merest mortal- how is it that I
have never desponded, that I have felt in every difﬁculty
the prevailing prescience that we should meet at last?
So cruelly was every vestige of her ﬂight concealed from
me—so suddenly, so secretly had she ﬂed, that all the
. spies, all the Authorities of Venice, could give me no
clue. All Italy I searched in vain ! Her young home at
Naples l—how still, in its humble chambers, there seemed
to linger the fragrance of her presence ! All the snblimest
secrets of our lore failed me-failed to bring her soul
visible to mine; yet morning and night, thou lone and
childless one, morning and night, detached from myself, I
can commune with my child i There, in that most blessed,
typical, and mysterious of all relations, Nature herself
appears to supply what Science would refuse. Space
cannot separate the Father’s watchful soul from the cradle
of his ﬁrst-born! I know not of its resting-place and
home -my visions picture not the land—only the small
and tender life to which all space is as yet the heritage!
For to the infant, before reason dawns—before man’s bad
passions can dim the essence that it takes from the ele-
ment it hath left, there is no peculiar country, no native
city, and no mortal language. Its soul as yet is the
denizen of all airs and of every world; and in space its
soul meets with mine—the Child communes with the
Father! Cruel and forsaking one—thou for whom I
left the wisdom of the spheres — thou, whose fatal dower

to Viola before she ﬂed; but when I would have sum-
moned his IDEA before me, it refused to obey; and I knew
then that his fate had become entwined with Viola’s. I
have tracked him, then, to his Lazar House: I arrived
but yesterday; I have not yet discovered him.

to make perpetual life the ﬁrst object of research! But

feel what sweetness and glory there is to die for the things
they love 1 I saw a father sacriﬁcing himself for his son;
he was subjected to charges which a word of his could
dispel —he was mistaken for his boy. With what joy he
seized the error—~confessed the noble crimes of valor and
ﬁdelity which the son had indeed committed —and went
to the doom, exulting that his death saved the life he had
given, not in vain ! I saw women, young, delicate, in the
bloom of their beauty; they had vowed themselves to
the cloister. Hands smeared with the blood of saints
opened the grate that had shut them from the world, and
bade them go forth, forget their vows, forswear the
Divine One these dieinons would depo'se, ﬁnd lovers and
helpmates, and be free. And some of these young hearts
had loved, and even, though in struggles, loved yet. Did
they forswear the vow? Did they abandon the faith?
Did even love allure them? Mejnour, with one voice,
they preferred to die I And whence comes this courage?
‘ because such hearts live in some more abstract and holier
' life than their own. But to live for ever upon this
earth, is to live in nothing diviner than ourselves. Yes,

his list of victims swelling every hour. Tallien, the Mac-
.duﬁ' to the doomed Macbeth, is whispering courage to his
pale conspirators. Along the streets heavily roll the
tumbrils. The shops are closed—the people are gorged
with gore and will lap no more. And night after night,
to the eighty theatres ﬂock the children of the Revolution,
to laugh at the quips of comedy, and weep gentle tears
over imaginary woes!
In a small chamber, in the heart of the city, sits the
mother, watching over her child ! It is quiet, happy noon ;
the sun-light, broken by the tall roofs in the narrow street,
comes yet through the open casement, the impartial play-

fellow of the air, gleesome alike in temple and prison, hall
and hovel; as golden and as blithe, whether it laugh over
the ﬁrst hour of life, or quiver in its gay delight on the
terror and agony of the last! The child, where it lay at
the feet of Viola, stretched out its dimpled hands as if to
clasp the dancing motes that revelled in the beam. The
mother turned her eyes from the glory; it saddened her
yet more.—— She turned and sighed.
Is this the same Viola who bloomed fairer than their
own Idalia under the skies of Greece? How changed!
How pale and worn l She sat listlessly, her arms drooping
on her knee; the smile that was habitual to her lips was
gone. A heavy, dull despondency, as if the life of life
were no more, seemed to weigh down her youth, and make
it weary of that happy sun l In truth, her existence had
languished away since it had wandered, as some melan-
choly stream, from the source that fed it. The sudden
enthusiasm of fear or superstition that had almost, as if
still in the unconscious movements of a dream, led her to
ﬂy from Zanoni, had ceased from the day which dawned
upon her in a foreign land. Then —there—she felt that
in the smile she had evermore abandoned lived her life.
She did not repent—she would not have recalled the
impulse that winged her ﬂight. Though the enthusiasm
was gone, the superstition yet remained ; she still believed
she had saved her child from that dark and guilty sorcery,
concerning which the traditions of all lands are prodigal,
but in none do they ﬁnd such credulity, or excite such
dread, as in the south of Italy. This impression was

conﬁrmed by the mysterious conversations of Glyndon,
and by her own perception of the fearful change that had
passed over one who represented himself as the victim of
the enchanters. She did not, therefore, repent-but her
very volition seemed gone. ‘
On their arrival at Paris, Viola saw her companion -
the faithful wife—no more. Ere three weeks were passed,
husband and wife had ceased to live.
And now, for the ﬁrst time, the drudgeries of this hard
earth claimed the beautiful Neapolitan. In that profession,
giving voice and shape to poetry and song, in which her
ﬁrst years were passed, there is, while it lasts, an excite-
ment in the art that lifts it from the labor of acalling.
Hovering between two lives, the Real and Ideal, dwells the
life of music and the stage. But that life was lost ever-
more to the idol of the eyes and ears of Naples. Lifted
to the higher realm of passionate love, it seemed as if the
ﬁctitious genius which represents the thoughts of others
was merged in the genius that grows all thought itself.
It had been the worst inﬁdelity to the Lost, to have de-
scended again to live on the applause of others. And so
-— for she would not accept alms from Glyndon—so, by
the commonest arts, the humblest industry which the sex
knows, alone and unseen, she, who had slept on the breast
of Zanoni, found a shelter for their child. As when, in
the noble verse preﬁxed to this chapter, Armida herself
has destroyed her enchanted palace,-not a vestige of
that bower, raised of old by Poetry and Love, remained
to say “it had been!”

And the child avenged the father: it bloomed—it
thrived ——it waxed strong in the light of life. But still
it seemed haunted and preserved by some other being than
her own. In its sleep there was that slumber, so deep and
rigid, which a thunderbolt could not have disturbed ; and
in such sleep often it moved its arms, as to embrace the
air: often its lips stirred with murmured sounds of indis-
tiuct affection — not for her; and all the while upon its
cheeks a hue of such celestial bloom-upon its lips, a
smile of such mysterious joyl Then when it waked, its
eyes did not turn ﬁrst to her-wistful, earnest, wandering,
they roved around, to ﬁx on her pale face, at last, in mute
sorrow and reproach.
Never had Viola felt before how mighty was her love
for Zanoni; how thought, feeling, heart, soul, life—all
lay crushed and dormant in the icy absence to which she
had doomed herself! She heard not the roar without, she
felt not one amidst those stormy millions,—- worlds of ex-
citement laboring through every hour. Only when Glyn-
don, haggard, wan, and spectre-like, glided in, day after
day, to visit her, did the fair daughter of the careless
South know how heavy and universal was the Death-Air
that girt her round. Sublime in her passive unconscious-
ness —her mechanic life -she sat, and feared not, in the
den of the Beasts of Preyl
The door of the room opened abruptly, and Glyndon
entered. His manner was more agitated than usual
“ Is it you, Clarence?” she said, in her soft, languid
tones. “ You are before the hour I expected you.”

“Who can count on his hours at Paris?” returned
Glyndon, with a frightful smile. “ Is it not enough that
I am here? Your apathy in the midst of these sorrows,
appals me. You say calmly, ‘Farewelll’-calmly you
bid me ‘Welcome l’— as if in every corner there was not
a spy, and as if with every day there was not a massacre l "
“Pardon me! But in these walls lies my world. 1
can hardly credit all the tales you tell me. Everything
here, save that (and she pointed to the infant) seems al-
ready so lifeless, that in the tomb itself one could scarcely
less heed the crimes that are done without.”
Glyndon paused for a few moments, and gazed with
strange and mingled feelings upon that face and form, still
so young, and yet so invested with that saddest of all
repose,— when the heart feels old.
“0 Viola!" said he, at last, and in a voice of sup-
pressed passion; “ was it thus I ever thought to see you
_ever thought to feel for you, when we two ﬁrst met in
the gay haunts of Naples ? Ah I why then, did you refuse
my love ?— or why was mine not worthy of you? Nay,

sweet as that youthful love can return to me again. I feel
for you but as a brother for some younger and lonely
sister. With you, in your presence, sad though it be, I
seem to breathe back the purer air of my earlyllife. Here
alone, except in scenes of turbulence and tempest, the
Phantom ceases to pursue me. I forget even the Death
that stalks behind, and haunts me as my shadow. But
better days may be in store for us yet. Viola, I at last

begin dimly to perceive how to baﬁie and subdue the
Phantom that has cursed my life—it is to brave, and
defy it. In sin and in riot, as I have told thee, it haunts
me not. But I comprehend now what Mejnour said in
his dark apothegms ‘that I should dread the spectre most
when unseen.’ In virtuous and calm resolution it appears
-~ ay, I behold it now-there—there with its livid eyes i
(and the drops fell from his brow). But it shall no longer
daunt me from that resolution. I face it, and it gradually
darkens back into the shade.” He paused,- and his eyes
dwelt with a terrible exultation upon the sun-lit space;
then, with a heavy and deep-drawn breath, he resumed —
“Viola, I have found the means of escape. We will leave
this city. In some other land we will endeavor to comfort
each other, and forget the past.”
“ N0,” said Viola, calmly ; “ I have no further wish to
stir, till I am borne hence to the last resting-place. I
dreamed of him last night, Clarence l—dreamed of him
for the ﬁrst time since we parted: and, do not mock me,
methought that he forgave the deserter, and called me
‘Wife.’ That dream hallows the room. Perhaps it will
visit me again before I die.”
“Talk not of him—of the demi-ﬁend l” cried Glyndon,
ﬁercely, and stamping his foot. “ Thank the Heavens for
any fate that hath rescued thee from him.”
“Hush !” said Viola, gravely. And as she was about
to proceed, her eye fell upon the child. It was standing
in the very centre of that slanting column of light which
the sun poured into the chamber; and the rays seemed to

surround it as a halo, and settled, crown-like, on the gold
of its shining hair. In its small shape, so exquisitely
modelled—in its large, steady, tranquil eyes, there was
something that awed, while it charmed the mother’s pride.
It gazed on Glyndon as he spoke, with a look which
almost might have seemed disdain, and which Viola, at
least, interpreted as a defence of the Absent, stronger
than her own lips could frame.
Glyndon broke the pause.
“ Thou wouldst stay—for what? To betray a mother’s
dutyl If an evil happen to thee here, what becomes of
thine infantY—Shall it be brought up an orphan, in a
country that has desecrated thy religion, and where human
charity exists no more] Ah, weep, and clasp it to thy
bosom! But tears do not protect and save.”
“ Thou hast conquered, my friend—I will ﬂy with thee.”
“To-morrow night, then, be prepared. I will bring
thee the necessary disguises.”
And Glyndon then proceeded to sketch rapidly the out-
line of the path they were to take, and the story they were
to tell. Viola listened, but scarcely comprehended: be

GLYNDON did not perceive, as he hurried from the house,
two forms crouching by the angle of the wall. He saw
still the spectre gliding by his side, but he beheld not the
yet more poisonous eyes of human envy and woman’s
jealousy that glared on his retreating footsteps.
Nicot advanced to the house; Fillide followed him in
silence. The Painter, an old sans-culolte, knew well what
language to assume to the porter. He beckoned the
latter from his lodge—“ How is this, Citizen? Thou
harborest a ‘suspect.”’
“ Citizen, you terrify me I —if so, name him.”
“ It is not a man ; a refugee—an Italian woman lodges
here.” _

“I T No, no, indeed. But ”
“Speak the truth! Who visits her?”

“That is it—an Englishman, a spy of Pitt and C0-

“Just Heaven !—is it possible 7”
“ How, Citizen! dost thou speak of Heaven? Thou
must be an aristoorat!”
“ No, indeed ; it was but an old bad habit, and escaped
me unawares.”
“How often does the Englishman visit her?”
“ Daily.”
Fillide uttered an exclamation.
“She never stirs out,” said the porter. “ Her sole
occupations are in work, and care of her infant.”
“ Her infant ! "
Fillide made a bound forward. Nicot in vain endeavored
to arrest her. She sprung up the stairs; she paused not
till she was before the door indicated by the porter; it
stood ajar—she entered—she stood at the threshold, and
beheld that face, still so lovely! The sight of so much
beauty left her hopeless. And the child, over whom the
mother bent l—she who had never been a mother 1 —-she
uttered no sound—the furies were at work within her
breast. Viola turned, and saw her; and, terriﬁed by the
strange apparition, with features that expressed the dead-
liest hate and scorn, and vengeance, uttered a cry, and
snatched the child to her bosom. The Italian laughed
aloud —tnrned, descended, and, gaining the spot where
Nicot still conversed with the frightened porter, drew him

from the house. When they were in the open street, she
halted abruptly, and said, “Avenge me, and name thy
price ! ”
“ My price, sweet one l is but permission to love thee,
Thou wilt ﬂy with me to-morrow night; thou wilt possess
thyself of the passports and the plan."
“And they -—”
“ Shall, before then, ﬁnd their asylum in the Concierge-
rie. The guillotine shall requite thy wrongs.”
“Do this, and I am satisﬁed,” said Fillide, ﬁrmly.
And they spoke no more till they regained the house.
But when she there, looking up to the dull building, saw
the windows of the room which the belief of Glyndon’s
love had once made a paradise, the tiger relented at the
heart; something of the woman gushed back upon her
nature, dark and savage as it was. She pressed the arm
on which she leaned convulsively, and exclaimed—“N0, -
no l—not him 1 denounce her—let her perish; but I have
slept on‘ his bosom—not him!”
“It shall be as thou wilt,” said Nicot, with a devil’s
sneer; ‘.‘ but he must be arrested for the moment. N0
harm shall happen to him, for no accuser shall appear.
But her—thou wilt not relent for her?”
Fillide turned upon him her eyes, and their dark glanco
was suﬁicient answer.

THE Italian did not overrate that craft of simulation
proverbial with her country_and her sex. Not a word,
not a look, that day revealed to Glyndon the deadly change
that had converted devotion into hate. He himself, indeed,
absorbed in his own schemes, and in reﬂections on his own
strange destiny, was no nice observer. But her manner,
milder and more subdued than usual, produced a soften-
ing effect upon his meditations towards the evening; and
he then began to converse with her on the certain hope of
escape, and on the future that would await them in less
nnhallowed lands.
“And thy fair friend,” said Fillide, with an averted eye
and a false smile, ‘p‘ who was to be our companion. Thou
hast resigned her, Nicot tells me, in favor of one in whom
he is interested. Is it so?” .
“ He told thee this I ” returned Glyndon, evasively
“Weill does the change content thee?” ‘
“ Traitor ! ” muttered Fillide ; and she rose suddenly,
approached him, parted the long hair from his forehead,
caressingly, and pressed her lips convulsively on his brow.

“This were too fair a head for the doomsman,” said
she, with a slight laugh, and, turning away, appeared
occupied in preparations for their departure.
The next morning, when he rose, Glyndon did not see
the Italian; she was absent from the house when he left
it. It was necessary that he should once more visit 0

before his ﬁnal departure, not only to arrange for N icot’s
participation in the ﬂight, but lest any suspicion should

pierre, and indeed secretly hostile to him, had possessed
, though not one of the immediate coterie of Robes-

the art of keeping well with each faction as it rose to
power. Sprung from the dregs of the populace, he had,
nevertheless, the grace and vivacity so often found impar-
tially amongst every class in France. He had contrived
to enrich himself—none knew how—in the course of
his rapid career. He became, indeed, ultimately one of
the wealthiest proprietors of Paris, and at that time kept
a splendid and hospitable mansion. He was one of those
whom, from various reasons, Robespierre deigned to
favor; and he had often saved the proscribed and sus-
pected, by procuring them passports under disguised
names, and advising their method of escape. But 0
was a man who took this trouble only for the rich. “ The

incorruptible Maximilien,” who did not want the tyrant’s
faculty of penetration, probably saw through all his
manoeuvres, and the avarice which he cloaked beneath
his charity. But it was noticeable, that Robespierre
frequently seemed to wink at—nay, partially to encour.

age—such vices in men whom he meant hereafter to
destroy, as would tend to lower them in the public esti-
mation, and to contrast with his own austere and unas-
sailable integrity and purism. And, doubtless, he often
grimly smiled in his sleeve at the sumptuous mansion,

and the griping covetousness of the worthy citizen C .
To this personage, then, Glyndon musingly bent his
way. It was true, as he had darkly said to Viola, that
in proportion as he had resisted the spectre, its terrors
had lost their inﬂuence. The time had come at last, when,
seeing crime and vice in all their hideousness, and in so
vast a theatre, he had found that in vice and crime there
are deadlier horrors than in the eyes of a phantom-fear.
His native nobleness began to return to him. As he passed
the streets, he revolved in his mind projects of future
repentance and reformation. He even meditated, as a
just return for Fillide’s devotion, the sacriﬁce of all the
reasonings of his birth and education. He would repair
whatever errors he had committed against her, by the
self-immolation of marriage with one little congenial with
himself. He who had once revolted from'marriage with
the noble and gentle Violal—he had learned in that
world of wrong to know that right is right, and that
Heaven did not make the one sex to be the victim of the
other. The young visions of the Beautiful and the Good
rose once more before him: and along the dark ocean of
his mind lay the smile of re-awakening virtue, as a path
of moon-light. Never, perhaps, hadthe condition of his
soul been so elevated and unselﬁsh.

In the meanwhile, Jean Nicot, equally absorbed in
dreams of the future, and already in his own mind laying
out to the best advantage the gold of the friend he was
about to betray, took his way to the house honored by
the residence of Robespierre. He had no intention to
comply with the relenting prayer of Fillide, that the life
of Glyndon should be spared. He thought with Barrere,
"’il n’y a que les morts qut' ne revient pas.” In all men
who have devoted themselves to any study, or any art,
with suﬂicient pains to attain a certain degree of excellence,
there must be a fund of energy immeasurably above that
of the ordinary herd. Usually, this energy is concentred
on the objects of their professional ambition, and leaves
them, therefore, apathetic to the other pursuits of men.
But where those objects are denied, where the stream has
not its legitimate vent, the energy, irritated and aroused,
possesses the whole being, and if not wasted on desultory
schemes, or if not puriﬁed by conscience and principle,
becomes a dangerous and destructive element in the social
system, through which it wanders in riot and disorder.
Hence, in all wise monarchies—nay, in all well-constituted
states, the peculiar care with which channels are opened
for every art and every science; hence the honor paid to
their cultivators by subtle and thoughtful statesmen, who,
perhaps, for themselves, see nothing in a picture but
colored canvas—nothing. in a problem but an ingenious
puzzle. No state is ever more in danger than when the
talent that should be consecrated to peace, has no occupa-
tion but political intrigue or personal advancement.

Talent unhonored is talent at war with men. And here
it is noticeable, that the class of Actors having been the
most degraded by the public opinion of the old regime,
their very dust deprived of Christian burial, no men (with
certain exceptions in the company especially favored by
the Court) were more relentless and revengef'ul among the
scourges of the revolution. In the savage Gollot d’Hcr-
bois, mauuais comedian, were embodied the wrongs and
the vengeance of a class.
Now the energy of Jean Nicot had never been suﬂi-
ciently directed to the Art he professed. Even in his
earliest youth, the political disquisitions of his master,
David, had distracted him from the more tedious labors
of the easel. The defects of his person had embittered
his mind; the Atheism of his benefactor had deadened
his conscience. For one great excellence of Religion —-
above all, the Religion of the Cross—is, that it raises
Parmucn ﬁrst into a Virtue, and next into a Hope.
Take away the doctrine of another life, of requital here-
after, of the smile of a Father upon our suﬂ'erings and
trials in our ordeal here, and what becomes of Patience?

tience, liberty neVer can be perfected. By wild throes,
and impetuous, aimless struggles, Intellect seeks to soar

ever abandoned, there are touches of humanity—relics of
virtue; and the true delineator of mankind often incurs
the taunt of bad hearts and dull minds, for showing that
even the worst alloy has some particles of gold, and even
the best that come stamped from the mint of Nature, have
some adulteration of the dross. But there are exceptions,
though few, to the general rule; exceptions, when the
conscience lies utterly dead, and when good or bad are
things indiﬁ'erent but as means to some selﬁsh end. So
was it with the protégé of the atheist. Envy and hate
ﬁlled up his whole being, and the consciousness of supe-
rior talent only made him curse the more all who passed
him in the sunlight with a fairer form or happier fortunes.
But monster though he was, when his murderous ﬁngers
griped the throat of his benefactor, Time, and that fer-
ment of all evil passions- the Reign of Blood, had made
in the deep hell of his heart a deeper still. Unable to
exercise his calling (for even had he dared to make his
name prominent, revolutions are no season for painters;
and no man —n0 ! not the richest and proudest magnate
of the land, has so great an interest in peace and order,
has so high and essential a stake in the well-being of so-
ciety, as the poet and the artist),—his whole intellect,
ever restless and unguided, was left to ponder over the
images of guilt most congenial to it. He had no Future
but in this life; and how in this life had the men of power
around him, the great wrestlers for dominion, thriven?
All that was good, pure, unselﬁsh—whether among Roy-
alists or Republicans—swept to the shambles, and the

deathsmen left alone in the pomp and purple of their
victims! Nobler paupers than Jean Nicot would des-
pair; and Poverty would rise in its ghastly multitudes
to cut the throat of Wealth, and then gash itself limb by
, limb, if Patience, the Angel of the Poor, sat not by its
side, pointing with solemn ﬁnger to the life to come!
And now as Nicot neared the house of the Dictator, he
began to meditate a reversal of his plans of the previous
day: not that he faltered in his resolution to denounce
Glyndon, and Viola would necessarily share his fate, as a
companion and accomplice, —no, there he was resolved 1
for he hated both—(to say nothing of his old, but never
to be forgotten grudge against Zanoni) —Viola had
scorned him, Glyndon had served, and the thought of
gratitude was as intolerable to him as the memory of in-
sult. But why, now, should he ﬂy from France?—he
could possess himself of Glyndon’s gold—he doubted not
that he could so master Fillide by her wrath and jealousy
that he could command her acquiescence in all he pro-
posed. The papers he had purloined—Desmouliu’s cor-
respondence with Glyndon—while it insured the fate of
the latter, might be eminently serviceable to Robespierre,
might induce the tyrant to forget his own old liaisons
with Hebert, and enlist him among the allies and tools
of the King of Terror. Hopes of advancement, of wealth,
of a career, again .rose before him. This correspondence,
dated shortly before Camille Desmoulin’s death, was writ-
ten with that careless and daring imprudence which char-
acterized the spoiled child of Danton. It spoke openly

of designs against Robespierre; it named confederates
whom the tyrant desired only a popular pretext to crush.
It was a new instrument of death in the hands of the
Death-compeller. What greater gift could he bestow on
Maximilien the Incorruptible? 4
Nursing these thoughts, he arrived at last before the
door of Citizen Dupleix. Around the threshold were
grouped, in admired confusion, some eight or ten sturdy
Jacobins, the voluntary body-guard of Robespierre—tall
fellows, well armed, and insolent with the power that re-
ﬂects power, mingled with women, young and fair, and
gaily dressed, who had come, upon the rumor that Maxi-
milien had had an attack of bile, to inquire tenderly of
his health ; for Robespierre, strange though it seem, was
the idol of the sex!
Through this cortege, stationed without the door, and
reaching up the stairs to the landing-place, for Robes-
pierre’s apartments were not spacious enough to afford
suﬂicient antechamber for levées so numerous and miscel-
laneous, Nicol: forced his way; and far from friendly or
flattering were the expressions that regaled his ears.
“Aha, le jolt Polichinelle!” said a comely-matron,
whose robe his obtrusive and angular elbows cruelly dis-
composed. “But how could one expect gallantry from
such a scarecrow!”

I see the hall is not wide enough for them.”
“ Ho 1 Citizen Nicot,” cried a Jacobin, shouldering his
formidable bludgeon, “and what brings thee hither?—
thinkest thou that Hebert’s crimes are forgotten already?
Oﬁ‘, sport of Nature 1 and thank the Etre Supréme that
he made thee insigniﬁcant enough to be forgiven.”
“A pretty face to look out of the National Window,” *
said the woman whose robe the painter had rufﬂed.
“Citizens,” said Nicot, white with passion, but con-
straining himself so that his words seemed to come from
grinded teeth, “I have the honor to inform you that I
seek the Représentant upon business ofthe utmost import-
ance to the public and himself; and,” he added, slowly,
and malignantly, glaring round, “ I call all good citizens
to be my witnesses when I shall complain to Robespierre
of the reception bestowed on me by some amongst you.”
There was in the man’s look and his tone of voice so
much of deep and concentrated malignity, that the idlers
drew back; and as the remembrance of the sudden ups
and downs of revolutionary life occurred to them, several
voices were lifted to assure the squalid and ragged painter

that nothing was farther from their thoughts than to offer
affront to a citizen, whose very appearance proved him to
be an exemplary sans-culotte. Nicot received these apolo-
gics in sullen silence ; and folding his arms, leaned against
the wall, waiting in grim patience for his admission.
The loiterers talked to each other in separate knots of
two and three; and through the general hum rang the
clear, loud, careless whistle of the tall Jacobin who stood
guard by the stairs. Next to Nicot, an old woman and
a young virgin were muttering in earnest whispers, and

cheeks swollen and purple with intemperauce, his eyes
dead and savage as a vulture’s. There was a still pause,
as all, with pale cheeks, made way for the relentless
Heuriot.* Scarce had this gruff and iron minion of the
tyrant stalked through the throng, when a new movement
of respect, and agitation, and fear, swayed the increasing
crowd, as there glided in, with the noiselessness of a
shadow, a smiling, sober citizen, plainly, but neatly, clad,
with a downcast, humble eye. A milder, meeker face, no
pastoral poet could assign to Gorydon or Thyrsis — why
did the crowd shrink and hold their breath ? As the ferret

ROBESPIERRE was reclining languidly in his fautcuil,
his cadaverous countenance more jaded and fatigued than
usual. He to whom Catherine Theot assured immortal
life, looked, indeed, like a man at death’s door. On the
table before him was a dish heaped with oranges, with the
juice of which it is said that he could alone assuage the
acrid bile that overﬂowed his system ; and an old woman,
richly dressed (she had been a Marquise in the old
regime), was employed in peeling the Hesperian fruits for
the sick Dragon, with delicate ﬁngers covered with jewels.
I have before said, that Robespierre was the idol of the
women. Strange, certainly l--but then they were French
women I The old Marquise, who, like Catherine Theot,
called him “son,” really seemed to love him piously and
disinterestedly as a mother: and as she peeled the oranges,
and heaped on him the most caressing and soothing ex-
pressions. the livid ghost of a smile ﬂuttered about his
meagre lips. At a distance, Payan and Couthon, seated

at another table, were writing rapidly, and occasionally
pausing from their work, to consult with each other in
brief whispers. '
Suddenly, one of the Jacobins opened the door, and
approaching Robespierre, whispered to him the name of
Guérin.* At that word the sick man started up, as if
new life were in the sound.
“ My kind friend,” he said to the Marquise, “forgive
me; I must dispense with thy tender cares. France
demands me. I am never ill when I can serve my
country !”
The old Marquise lifted up her eyes to heaven, and
murmured - “ Quel ange ! ”
Robespierre waved his hand impatiently; and'the old
woman, with a sigh, patted his pale cheek, kissed his
forehead, and submissively withdrew. The next moment,
the smiling, sober man we have before described, stood,
bending low, before the tyrant. And well might Robes-
pierre welcome one of the subtlest agents of his power-'-
one on whom he relied more than the clubs of his Jaco-
bins, the tongues of his orators, the bayonets of his
armies; Guérin, the most renowned of his écouteurs-
the searching, prying, universal, omnipresent spy—who
glided like a sunbeam through chink and crevice, and
brought to him intelligence not only of the deeds, but the
hearts of men!

three months’ purchase for his life.’ I do not know,

smile, succeeded by an expression of gloomy thought.

of life. I commit no excess. No; my constitution is
sound—sound. Anything farther of Tallien?”

between the prisoner and himself.”
“ So! The servant shall be seized in the open streets
of Paris. The Reign of Terror is not over yet. With
the letters found on him, if such their context, I will pluck
Tallien from his benches in the Convention.”
Robespierre rose, and after walking a few moments to
and fro the room in thought, opened the door, and sum-
moned one of the Jacobins without. To him he gave his
orders for the watch and arrest of Tallien’s servant; and
then threw himself again into his chair. As the Jacobin
departed, Guérin whispered—
“Is not that the citizen Aristides?”
“Yes; a faithful fellow, if he would wash himself, and
.not swear so much.”
“Didst thou not guillotine his brother?"
“But Aristides denounced him.”
“Nevertheless, are such men safe about thy person .7”
“Humph! that is true.” And Robespierre, drawing
out his pocket-book, wrote a memorandum in it, replaced
it in his vest, and resumed-
“What else of Tallien?”
“ Nothing more. He and Legendre, with the un-
known, walked to the Jardin Egalité, and there parted»

“ Gnérin l Hast thou detected them? Hast thou --

And the tyrant, as he spoke, opened and shut both his
hands, as if already grasping the lives of the writers, and
one of those convulsive grimaces, that seemed like an
epileptic affection, to which he was subject, distorted his
features.
“Citizen, I think I have found one. Thou must know,
that, amongst those. most disaffected, is the painter,
Nicot.”
“ Stay, stay 1" said Robespierre, opening a manuscript
book, bound in red morocco (for Robespierre was neat
and precise, even in his death-lists), and turning to an
alphabetical index—“Nicotl-I have him—atheist,
sans-culotle (I hate slovens), friend of Hébertl Ahal

“ This Nicot has been suspected of diffusing tracts and
pamphlets against thyself and the Gomité. Yesterday
evening, when he was out, his porter admitted me into his
apartment, Rue Beau-Repaire. With my master-key I
opened his desk and escritoire. I found therein a draw-
ing of thyself, at the guillotine; and underneath was
written —‘ Bourreau de ton pays, lis l’arrét de ton

of the various letters thou gavest me: the handwriting

Robespierre looked, smiled,‘ and, as if his vengeance
were already satisﬁed, threw himself on his chair. “It is
well! I feared it was a more powerful enemy. This man
must be arrested at once.”
“ And he waits below. I brushed by him as I ascended
the stairs.”
“Does he so ?-admit!—nay—holdl hold! Guérin,
withdraw into the inner chamber till I summon thee again.
Dear Payan, see that this Nicot conceals no weapons.”
Payan, who was as brave as Robespierre was pusillani-
mons, repressed the smile of disdain that quivered on his
lips a moment, and left the room.
Meanwhile, Robespierre, with his head buried in his
bosom, seemed plunged in deep thought. “ Life is a
melancholy thing, Conthon I” said he, suddenly.
“ Begging your pardon, I think death worse,” answered
the philanthropist, gently.
Robespierre made no rejoinder, but took from his porte-
feuille that singular letter which was found afterwards
amongst his papers, and is marked LXI. in the published
collection.*
“Without doubt,” it began, “you are uneasy at not
having earlier received news from me. Be not alarmed;
you know that I ought only to reply by our ordinary
courier; and as he has been interrupted dans sa derniére
course, that is the cause of my delay. When you receive
this, employ all diligence to ﬂy a theatre where you are

impatience, to laugh with you at the part you have played I
in the troubles of a nation as credulous as it is avid of
novelties. Take your part according to our arrangements
—all is prepared. I conclude-our courier waits. I ex-
pect your reply.”
Musingly and slowly the Dictator devoured the con-
tents of this epistle. “ No,” he said to himself—“ no; he
who has tasted power can no longer enjoy repose. Yet,
Danton, Danton! thou wert right; better to be a poor
ﬁsherman, than to govern men.”*
The door opened, and Payan reappeared and whis-
pered Robespierre—“All is safe! See the man.”
The Dictator, satisﬁed, summoned his attendant Jaco-
bin to conduct Nicot to his presence. The painter en-
tered with a fearless expression in his deformed features,
and stood erect before Robespierre, who scanned him with
a sidelong eye.
It is remarkable that most of the principal actors of
the Revolution were singularly hideous in appearance—-
from the colossal ugliness of Mirabeau and Danton, or

the villanous ferocity in the countenances of David and
Simon, to the ﬁlthy squalor of Marat, the sinister and
bilious meanness of the Dictator’s features. But Robes-
pierre, who was said to resemble a cat, had also a cat’s
cleanness; and his prim and dainty dress, his shave'n
smoothness, the womanly whiteness of his lean hands,
made yet more remarkable the disorderly ruﬁianism that
characterized the attire and mien of the painter-sam-
culotte.
“And so, citizen,” said Robespierre, mildly, “thou
wouldst speak with me? I know thy merits and civism
have been overlooked too long. Thou wouldst ask some
suitable provision in the State? Scruple not—say on !”
“Virtuous Robespierre, toi qui éclaires l’univers,* I
come not to ask a favor, but to render service to the
State. I have discovered a correspondence that lays open
a conspiracy, of which many of the actors are yet unsus-
pected.” And he placed the papers on the table. Robes-
pierre seized, and ran his eye over them rapidly and
eagerly.
“ Good -good i” he muttered to himself; — “this is

the world; that farce ended with Anarcharsis Clootz. I
beg pardon, Citizen Nicot; but Clootz and Hebert were
thy friends.”
“Nay,” said Nicot, apologetically, “we are all liable
to be deceived. I ceased to honor them whom thou didst
declare against; for I disown my own senses rather than
thy justice.”
“ Yes, I pretend to justice; that is the virtue I aﬂ‘ect,”
said Robespierre, meekly; and with his feline propensities
he enjoyed, even in that critical hour of vast schemes, of
imminent danger, of meditated revenge, the pleasure of
playing with a solitary victim.* “And my justice shall
no longer be blind to thy services, good Nicot. Thou
knowest this Glyndon ?”
“Yes, well—intimately. He was my friend, but I
would give up my brother if he were one of the ‘in-
dulgenls.’ I am not ashamed to say, that I have received
favors from this man.”
“Aha l—and thou dost honestly hold the doctrine that
where a man threatens my life, all personal favors are to
be forgotten ? ”

pen was in his hand, a thought ﬂashed across him, and he
paused, embarrassed and confused.
“Write on, kind Nicot ! ”
The painter slowly obeyed.
“Who are the other familiars of Glyndon?”
“ It was on that point I was about to speak to thee,
Beprésenfant,” said Nicot. “He visits daily a woman, a
foreigner, who knows all his secrets ; she aﬁ'ects to be poor,
and to support her child by industry. But she is the wife
of an Italian ofimmense wealth, and there is no doubt that
she has moneys which are spent in corrupting the citizens.
She should be seized and arrested.”
“Write down her name also.”
“ But no time is to be lost; for I know that both have
a design to escape from Paris this very night.”
“ Our government is prompt, good Nicot—never fear.
Humph l—humph !” and Robespierre took the paper on
which Nicot had written, and stooping over it—for he
was near-sighted — added, smilingly, “ Dost thou always
write the same hand, citizen? This seems almost like a
disguised character.”
“ I should not like them to know who denounced them,
Représentant. ”
“ Good ! good !_ Thy virtue shall be rewarded, trust
me. Saluz ct fraternité! ”
Robespierre half rose as he spoke, and Nicot withdrew.
“ H0, there ! — without l” cried the Dictator, ringing
his bell ; and as the ready Jacobin attended the (summons)

The Jacobin vanished. All trace of illness, of inﬁrmity,
had gone from the valetudinarian ; he stood erect on the
door, his face twitching convulsively, and his arms folded.

IN the mean time, Glyndon, after an audience of\s0me
length with C , in which the ﬁnal preparations were
arranged, sanguine of safety, and foreseeing no obstacle
to escape, bent his way back to Fillide. Suddenly, in the
midst of his cheerful thoughts, he fancied he heard a voice
too well and too terribly recognized, hissing in his car,
—“'What I thou wouldst defy and escape me i thou wouldst
go back to virtue and content. It is in vain _it is too

late. No, I will not haunt thee; — human footsteps, no
less inexorable, dog thee now. Me thou shalt not see
again till in the dungeon, at midnight, before thy doom!
Behold! ”
And Glyndon, mechanically turning his head, saw,

close behind him, the stealthy ﬁgure of a man whom he
had observed before, but with little heed, pass and repass
him, as he quitted the house of Citizen C
and instinctively he knew that he was watched—that he

pleasure. Bold as he was, an icy chill shot through his
heart. He knew too well the tremendous system that then
reigned in Paris, not to be aware of his danger. As the
sight of the ﬁrst plague-boil to the victim of the pestilence,
was the ﬁrst sight of the shadowy spy to that of the Revo-

towards his pursuer, who retreated as he advanced.

forward. The next moment Glyndon plunged into a
winding lane, and ﬂed fast through a labyrinth of streets,
passages, and alleys. By degrees, he composed himself,
and, looking behind, imagined that he had bafﬂed the
pursuer; he then, by a circuitous route, bent his way once
more to his home. As he emerged into one of the broader
streets, a passenger, wrapped in a mantle, brushing so
quickly by him that he did not observe his countenance,
whispered—“ Clarence Glyndon, you are dogged—follow

me !" and the stranger walked quickly before him. Clar-
ence turned, and sickened once more to see at his heels,
with the same servile smile on his face, the pursner he
fancied he had escaped. He forgot the injunction 0f the
stranger to follow him, and perceiving a crowd gathered
close at hand, round a caricature-shop, dived amidst them,
and, gaining another street, altered the direction he had
before taken, and, after a long and breathless course,
gained, without once more seeing the spy, a distant quartiér
of the city. Here, indeed, all seemed so serene and fair,
that his artist eye, even in that imminent hour, rested with
pleasure on the scene. It was a comparatively broad
space, formed by one of the nobler quays. The Seine
ﬂowed majestically along, with boats and craft resting on
its surface. The sun gilt a thousand spires and domes,
and gleamed on the white "palaces of a fallen chivalry.
Here, fatigued and panting, he paused an instant, and a
cooler air from the river-fanned his brow. “Awhile, at
least I am safe here,” he murmured ; and as he spoke, some
thirty paces behind him, he beheld the spy. He stood
rooted to the spot; wearied and spent as he was, escape
seemed no longer possible—the river on one side (no
bridge at hand), and the long row of mansions closing up
the other. As he halted, he heard laughter and obscene
songs, from a house a little in his rear, between himself
and the spy. It was a café fearfully known in that quarter.
Hither often resorted the black troop of Henriot—the
minions and huissiers of Robespierre. The spy, then, had
hunted the victim within the jaws of the hounds. The

mauoslowly advanced, and pausing before the open window
of the café, put his head through the aperture, as to address
and summon forth its armed inmates.
At that very instant, and while the spy’s head was thus
turned from him, standing in the half-open gateway of the
house immediately before him, he perceived the stranger
who had warned ; the ﬁgure, scarcely distinguishable
through the mantle that wrapped it, motioned to him to
enter. He sprang noiselessly through the friendly open-
ing; the door closed; breathlessly he followed the stranger
up a ﬂight of broad stairs, and through a suite of empty
rooms, until, having gained a small cabinet, his conductor
doﬁ'ed the large hat and the long mantle that had hitherto
concealed his shape and features, and Glyndon beheld

solace, hls escape, in the recognition of a holy and spir-
itual Theurgia—of a magic that could summon the Angel,
or the Good Genius, not the Fiend? And do you not
remember how be, deeply versed as he was, for his age,
in the mysteries of the nobler Platonism, which hints at
the secrets of all the starry brotherhoods, from the Chal-
daean to the later Rosicrucian, discriminates in his lovely
verse, between the black art of Ismeno and the glorious
lore of the Enchanter who counsels and guides upon their
errand the Champions of the Holy Land? His, not the
charms wrought by the aid of the Stygian Rebels; * but
the perception of the secret powers of the fountain and
the herb—the Arcana of the unknown nature and the
various motions of the stars. His, the holy haunts of
Lebanon and Carmel—beneath his feet he sawthe clouds
the snows, the hues of Iris, the generations of the rains
and dews. Did the Christian Hermit who converted that
Enchanter (no fabulous being, but the type of all spirit
that would aspire through Nature up to God), command
him to lay aside these sublime studies, ‘ Le solite arte e l’
uso mio ?’ No l but to cherish and direct them to worthy
ends. And in this grand conception of the poet lies the
secret of the true Theurgia, which startles your ignorance
in a more learned day with puerile apprehensions, and
the nightmares of a sick man’s dreams.”

Again Zanoni paused, and again resumed : —
“In ages far remote—of a civilization far diﬁ'erent
from that which now merges the individual in the state,
there existed men of ardent minds, and an intense desire
of knowledge. In the mighty and solemn kingdoms in
which they dwelt, there were no turbulent and earthly
channels to work off the fever of their minds. Set in
the antique mould of castes through which no intellect
could pierce, no valor could force its way, the thirst for
wisdom, alone, reigned in the hearts of those who'received
its study as a heritage from sire to son. Hence, even in
your imperfect records of the progress of human knowledge
you ﬁnd that, in the earliest ages, Philosophy descended
not to the business and homes of men. It dwelt amidst
the wonders of the loftier creation; it sought to analyze
the formation of matter—the essentials of the prevailing
soul; to read the mysteries of the starry orbs; to dive
into those depths of Nature in which Zoroaster is said by
the schoolmen ﬁrst to have discovered the arts which your
ignorance classes under the name of magic. In such an
age, then, arose some men, who, amidst the vanities and
delusions of their class, imagined that they detected gleams
of a brighter and steadier lore. They fancied an affinity
existing among all the works of Nature, and that in the
lowliest lay the secret attraction that might conduct them
upward to the loftiest.* Centuries passed, and lives were

Plotinus, that the universe is as an animal; so that there is sym-

wasted in these discoveries ; but step after step was chron-
icled and marked, and became the guide to the few who
alone had the hereditary privilege to track their path.
At last from this dimness upon some eyes the light broke;
but think not, young visionary, that to those who nursed
unholy thoughts, over whom the Origin of Evil held a
sway, that dawning was vouchsafed. It could be given
then, as now, only to the purest ecstasies of imagination
and intellect, undistracted by the cares of a vulgar life,
or the appetites of the common clay. Far from descend-
ing to the assistance of a ﬁend, theirs was but the august
ambition to approach nearer to the Fount of Good; the
more they emancipated themselves from this limbo of the
planets, the more they were penetrated by the splendor
and beneﬁcence of God. And if they sought, and at last
discovered, how to the eye of the Spirit all the subtler
modiﬁcations of being and of matter might be made
apparent; if they discovered how, for the wings of the
Spirit, all space might be annihilated; and while the body
stood heavy and solid here, as a deserted tomb, the freed
Idea might wander from star to star ;—if such discoveries
became in truth their own, the sublimest luxury. of their
knowledge was but this—t0 wonder, to venerate, and
adore l For, as one not unlearned in these high matters

magnetism of Nature. But man contemplates the universe as an
animalcule would an elephant. The animalcule, seeing scarcely
the tip of the hoof, would be incapable of comprehending that the
trunk belonged to the same creature—that the eﬂ'ect produced
upon one extrerm'ry would be felt in an instant by the other

has expressed it, ' There is a principle of the soul superior
to all external nature, and through this principle we are
capable of surpassing the order and systems of the world,
and participating the immortal life and the energy of the
Sublime Celestials. When the soul is elevated to natures
above itself, it deserts the order to which it is awhile
compelled, and by a religious magnetism is attracted.to
another, and a loftier, with which it blends and mingles.’*
Grant, then, that such beings found at last the secret to
arrest death — to fascinate danger and the foe —to walk
the revolutions of the earth unharmed; think you that
this life could teach them other desire than to yearn the
more for the Immortal, and to ﬁt their intellect the better

This address was so diﬂ'erent from what Glyndon had
anticipated, that he remained for some moments speech-
ess, and at length faltered out-
“But why, then, to me ”

and will become the master?-—can the student, when he
has bought his Euclid, become a NewtonT—can the
youth whom the Muses haunt, say. ‘ I will equal Homer 1’
-yea, can you pale tyrant, with all the parchment-laws
of a hundred system-shapers, and the pikes of his daunt-
less multitude, carve, at his will, a constitution not more
vicious than the one which the madness of a mob could
overthrow? When, in that far time to which I have
referred, the student aspired to the heights to which thou
wouldst have sprung at a single bound, he was trained
from his 'very cradle to the career he was to run. The
internal and the outward nature were made clear to his
eyes, year after year, as they opened on the day. He
was not admitted to the practical initiation till not one
earthly wish chained that sublimest faculty which you call
the IMAGINATION, one carnal desire clouded the penetra-
tive essence that you call the INTELLECT. And even then,
and at the best, how few attained to the'last mystery!
Happier inasmuch as they attained the earlier to the holy
glories for which Death is the heavenliest gate.”
Zanoni paused, and a shade of thought and sorrow
darkened his celestial beauty.
“And are there, indeed, others, besides thee and Mej-
nour, who lay claim to thine attributes, and have attained
to thy secrets?”
“Others there have been before us, but we two new

“ Child of a day l ” answered Zanoni, mournfully, “have
I not told thee the error of our knowledge was the for-
getfulness of the desires and passions which the spirit
never can wholly and permanently conquer, while this
matter cloaks it? Canst thou think that it is no sorrow,
either to reject all human ties, all friendship, and all love,
or to see, day after day, friendship and love wither from
our life, as blossoms from the stem? Canst thou wonder
how, with the power to live while the world shall last, ere
even our ordinary date be ﬁnished we yet may prefer to
die ? Wonder rather that there are two who have clung
so faithfully to earth! Me, I confess, that earth can

Glyndon looked and believed. He whispered the
address to the house whither his fatal step already had
brought woe and doom.
“Bless thee for this,” exclaimed Zanoni, passionately,
“ and thou shalt be blessed! What! couldst thou not

thee to worse foes to the soul, its presence is ever absent,
hast thou never bravely resisted the spectre and thine own
horror?-—hast thou never said, ‘Come what may, to
Virtue I will cling?”’
“Alas l” answered Glyndon, “only of late have I dared
to do so.”
“And thou hast felt then that the Phantom grew more
dim and its power more faint.”
“It is true.”
“Rejoice, then l—thou hast overcome the true terror

As he thus spoke, Zanoni laid his hand gently on the
burning temples of his excited and wondering listener;
and presently a sort of trance came over him: he imagined
that he was returned to the home of his infancy ; that he
was in the small chamber where, over his early slumbers,
his mother had watched and prayed. There it was—-
visible, palpable, solitary, unaltered. In the recess, the
homely bed; on the walls, the shelves ﬁlled with holy
books; the very easel on which he had ﬁrst sought to
call the ideal to the canvas, dust-covered, broken, in the
corner. Below the window lay the old church-yard; he
saw it green in the distance, the sun glancing through the
yew-trees; he saw the tomb where father and mother lay
united, and the spire pointing up to Heaven, the symbol
of the hopes of those who consigned the ashes to the
dust; in his ear rang the bells, pealing, as on a sabbath
day; far ﬂed all the visions of anxiety and awe that had
haunted and convulsed; youth, boyhood, childhood, came
back to him with innocent desires and hopes; he thought
he fell upon his knees to pray. He woke—he woke in
delicious tears ; he felt that the Phantom was ﬂed for ever.

He looked round — Zanoni was gone. On the table lay
these lines, the ink yet wet—
“ I will ﬁnd ways and means for thy escape. At night
fall, as the clock strikes nine, a boat shall wait thee ou
the river before this house: the boatman will guide thee
to a retreat where thou mayst rest in safety, till the Reign
of Terror, which nears its close, be past. Think no more
of the sensual 10ve that lured, and well-nigh lost, thee.
It betrayed, and would have destroyed. Thou wilt regain
thy land in safety—long years yet spared to thee to muse
over the past, and to redeem it. For thy future, be thy
dream thy guide, and thy tears thy baptism.”
The Englishman obeyed the injunctions of the letter,
and found their truth.

A crowd had gathered round the Rue St. Honoré—a
young man was just arrested by the order of Robespierre.
He was known to be in the service of Tallien, that hostile
leader in the Convention, whom the tyrant had hitherto
trembled to attack. This incident had therefore produced
a greater excitement than a circumstance so customary as
an arrest in the Reign of Terror might be supposed to
create. Amongst the crowd were many friends of Tallien,
many foes to the tyrant, many weary of beholding the
tiger dragging victim after victim to its den. Hoarse,
foreboding murmurs were heard ; ﬁerce eyes glared upon
the ofﬁcers as they seized their prisoner; and though they
did not yet dare openly to resist, those in the rear pressed
on those behind, and encumbered the path of the captive

and his captors. The young man struggled hard for
escape, and, by a violent eﬁ'ort, at last wrenched himself
from the grasp. The crowd made way, and closed round
to protect him, as he dived and darted through their
ranks; but suddenly the trampling of horses was heard
at hand — the savage Henriot and his troop were bearing
down upon the mob. The crowd gave way in alarm, and
the prisoner was again seized by one of the partisans of
the Dictator. At that moment a voice whispered the
prisoner— “ Thou hast a letter, which, if found on thee,
ruins thy last hope. Give it to me! I will bear it to
Tallien.” The prisoner, turning in amaze, read something
that encouraged him in the eyes of the stranger who thus
accoated him; the troop were now on the spot; the
Jacobin who had seized the prisoner released hold of him
for a moment, to escape the hoofs of the horses—in that
moment the opportunity was found—the stranger had
disappeared.

At the house of Tallien the principal foes of the tyrant
were assembled. Common danger made common fellow-
ship. All factions laid aside their feuds for the hour, to
unite against the formidable man who was marching over
all factions to his gory throne. There, was bold Lecointre,
the declared enemy—there, creeping Barrera, who would .
reconcile all extremes, the hero of the cowards; Barras,
calm and collected—Collot d’Herbois, breathing wrath and
vengeance, and seeing not that the crimes of Robespierre
alone sheltered his own.

The council was agitated and irresolnte. The awe
which the uniform success and the prodigious energy of
Robespierre excited still held the greater part under its
control. Tallien, whom the tyrant most feared, and. who
alone could give head and substance and direction to so
mary contradictory passions, was too sullied by the
memory of his own cruelties, not to feel embarrassed by
his position as the champion of mercy. “It is true,” he
said, after an animating harangue from Lecointre, “that
the Usurper menaces us all. But he is still so beloved by
his mobs—still so supported by his Jacobins—better delay
open hostilities till the hour is more ripe. To attempt and
not succeed is to give us, bound hand and foot, to the
guillotine. Every day his power must decline. Procrasti-
nation is our best ally—” While yet speaking, and
while yet producing the effect of water on the ﬁre, it was .
announced that a stranger demanded to see him instantly
on business that brooked no delay.
“I am not at leisure,” said the orator, impatiently.
The servant placed a note on the table. Tallien opened
it, and found these words in pencil, “ From the prison of
Teresa de Fontenai.” He turned pale, started up, and
hastened to the ante-room, where he beheld a face entirely
strange to him.
“Hope of France!” said the visitor to him, and the
very sound of his voice went straight to the heart --“your
servant is arrested in the streets. I have saved your life,
and that of your wife who will be. I bring to you this
letter from Teresa de Fontenai.”


## p. 261 (#561) ############################################

Tallien, with a trembling hand, opened the letter, and
read —“Am I for ever to implore you in vain ? Again
and again I say— Lose not an hour, if you value my life
and your own. My trial and death are ﬁxed the third
day from this—the 10th Thermidor. Strike while it is
yet time—strike the monster l—you have two days yet
If you fail—if you procrastinate—see me for the last
time as I pass your windows to the guillotine l”
“ Her trial will give proof against you,” said the
stranger. “ Her death is the herald of your own. Fear
not the populace — the populace would have rescued your
servant. Fear not Robespierre—he gives himself to your
hands. To-morrow he comes to the Convention—t0-
morrow you must cast the last throw for his head or your
own.”
“ To-morrow he comes to the Convention 1 And who
are you, that know so well what is concealed from me?”
“A man, like you, who would save the woman he loves.”
Before Tallien could recover his surprise, the visitor
was gone.
Back went the Avenger to his conclave, an altered man.
“ I have heard tidings—no matter what,” he cried, “ that
have changed my purpose. On the 10th we are destined
to the guillotine. I revoke my counsel for delay. Robes-
pierre comes to the Convention to-morrow; there we must
confront and crush him. From the Mountain shall frown
against him the grim shade of Danton —from the Plain

“ Frappons! ” cried even Barrere, startled into energy
by the new daring of his colleague. “ Frappons! 'il n’y
.z que les morls qui ne re-uiennent pas.”
It was observable (and the fact may be found in one
of the memoirs of-the time) that, during that day and
night (the 7th Thermidor), a stranger to all the previous
events of that stormy time was seen in various parts of
the city—in the cafés, the clubs, the haunts of the various
factions-that, to the astonishment and dismay of his
hearers, he talked aloud of the crimes of Robespierre,
and predicted his coming fall ; and, as he spoke, be stirred
up the hearts of men, he loosed the bonds of their fear,
he inﬂamed them with nnwonted rage and daring. But
what surprised them most was, that no voice replied—
no hand was lifted against him—no minion, even of the
tyrant, cried, “Arrest the Traitor!” In that impunity
men read, as in a book, that the populace had deserted
the man of blood.
Once only a ﬁerce, brawny Jacobin sprung up from
the table at which he sat, drinking deep, and, approach-
ing the stranger, said, “ I seize thee, in the name of the
Republic.”
“ Citizen Aristides,” answered the stranger, in a whis-
per, “go to the lodgings of Robespierre ; he is from home,
and in the left pocket of the vest, which be cast oil” not
an hour since, thou wilt ﬁnd a paper; when thou hast
read that, return. I will await thee: and if thou wouldst

on these lowering brows: touch me now, and thou wilt be
torn to pieces.”
The Jacobin felt as if compelled to obey against his
will. He went forth muttering; he returned; the stranger
was still there. “ Mille tonnerres,” he said to him -- “ I
thank thee; the poltroon had my name in his list for the
guillotine.”
With that the J acobin Aristides sprung upon the table, .
and shouted, “Death to the Tyrant!”

its power, its rage, its despotism, its accents, touching—-

me to be calumniated. It is in my very zeal that they
discover my guilt. Take from me my conscience, and I
should be the most miserable of men!”
He paused; and Oouthon wiped his eyes, and St. Just
murmured applause, as with stern looks he gazed on the
rebellious Mountain; and there was a dead, mournfnl,
and chilling silence through the audience. The touching
sentiment woke no echo.
The orator cast his eyes around. H01 he will soon
arouse that apathy. He proceeds; he praises, he pities

himself, no more. He denounces—he accuses. Over-
ﬁooded with his venom, he vomits it forth on all. At
home, abroad, ﬁnances, war—on all l Shriller and sharper
rose his voice—
“A. conspiracy exists against the Public Liberty. It
owes its strength to a criminal coalition in the very bosom
of the Convention; it has accomplices in the bosom of
the Committee of Public Safety. . . . . What is the
remedy to this evil? To punish the traitors; to purify
this committee; to crush all factions by the weight of
the National Authority; to raise upon their ruins the
power of Liberty and Justice. Such are the principles
of that Reform. Must I be ambitious to profess them?
-—then the principles are proscribed, and Tyranny reigns
amongst us! For what can you object to a man who is
in the right, and has at least this knowledge—he knows
how to die for his native land! I am made to combat
crime, and not to govern it. The time, alas! is not yet
arrived when men of worth can serve with impunity their
country. So long as the knaves rule, the defenders of
liberty will be only the proscribed.”
For two hours, through that cold and gloomy audience
shrilled the Death-speech. In silence it began, in silence
closed. The enemies of the orator were afraid to express
resentment : they knew not yet the exact balance of power.
His partisans were afraid to approve; they knew not
whom of their own friends and relations the accusations
were designed to single forth. “Take care!” whispered
each to each, “it is thou whom he threatens.” But silent

though the audience, it was, at the ﬁrst, well-nigh sub-
dued. There was still about this terrible man the spell
of an over-mastering will. Always—though not what
is called a great orator—resolute, and sovereign in the
use of words, words seemed as things when uttered by
one who with a nod moved the troops of Henriot, and
inﬂuenced the judgment of Réné Dumas, grim President
of the Tribunal. Lecointre of Versailles rose, and there
was an anxious movement of attention ; for Lecointre was
one of the ﬁercest foes of the tyrant. What was the dis-
may of the Tallien faction —what the complacent smile
of Couthon, when Lecointre demanded only that the
oration should be printed l All seemed paralyzed. At
length Bourdon de l’Oise, whose name was doubly marked
in the black list of the Dictator, stalked to the tribune,

cast his gaze where sat the strangers admitted to hear
the debates. And, suddenly, he met the eyes of the Un-

Foutenai, the preceding day. The eyes fascinated him
as he gazed. In after-times, he often said, that their
regard, ﬁxed, earnest, half-reproachful, and yet cheering
and triumphant, ﬁlled him with new life and courage.
They spoke to his heart as the trumpet speaks to the war-
horse. He moved from his seat; he whispered with his
allies: the spirit he had drawn in was contagious: the
men whom Robespierre especially had denounced, and
who saw the sword over their heads, woke from their
torpid trance. Vadier, Cambon, Billaud-Varennes, Panis,
Amar, rose at once—all at once demanded speech.

they interrupt him; they drown his voice; they demand
the reversal of the motion. Amar moves again that the
speech be referred to the Committees—t0 the Commitees

Robespierre wraps himself in silent and superb disdain.
Pale, defeated, but not yet destroyed, he stands, a storm
in the midst of storm!
The motion is carried. All men foresee in that defeat
the Dictator’s downfall. A solitary cry rose from the
galleries; it was caught up ; it circled through the hall—-
the audience: “A bus le tyrant! Vive la République! ”*

passed through the throng, leaning on St. Just, Payan
and his brother following him.
As they got into the open space, Robespierre abruptly
broke the silence.
“ How many heads were to fall upon the tenth?”
“Eighty,” replied Payan. g
‘Ah, we must not tarry so long; a day may lose an
empire! terrorism must serve us yet!”
He was silent a few moments, and his eyes roved sus-
piciously through the street.
“ St. Just,” he said, abruptly, “they have not found this
Englishman, whose revelations, or whose trial, would have
crushed the Amars and the Talliens. No, no ! my Jaco-
bins themselves are growing dull and blind. But they
have seized a woman—only a woman!”
“A woman’s hand stabbed Marat,” said St. Just. RO- '
bespierre stopped short, and breathed hard.
“St. Just,” said he, “ when this peril is past, we will
found the Reign of Peace. There shall be homes and
gardens set apart for the old. David is already designing

The trial, the execution of the victims is advanced a

guided and animated him hitherto, Zanoni learned that
his arts had been in vain. He knew that Viola was safe,
if she could but survive an hour the life of the tyrant.
He knew that Robespierre’s hours were numbered; that
the 10th of Thermidor, on which he had originally de-
signed the execution of his last victims, would see himself
at the scaffold. Zanoni had toiled, had schemed for the
fall of the Butcher and his reign. To what end i A single

To-Moaaowl—aud it is already twilight. One after
one, the gentle stars come smiling through the heaven.
The Seine, in its slow waters, yet trembles with the last
kiss of the rosy day; and still, in the blue sky, gleams
the spire of N otre Dame ;\ and still, in the blue sky, looms
the guillotine by the Barriére du Trone. Turn to that
time-worn building, once the church and the convent of
the Fréres-Précheurs, known by the then holy name of
Jacobins ; there the new Jacobins hold their club. There,
in that oblong hall, once the library of the peaceful monks,
assemble the idolaters of Saint Robespierre. Two im-
mense tribunes, raised at either end, contain the lees and
dregs of the atrocious populace—the majority of that
audience consisiiug of the furies of the guillotine (fum'es

and chair of the president—the chair long preserved by
the piety of the monks as the relic of St. Thomas Aquinas!

Above this seat scowls the harsh bust of Brutus. An iron
lamp, and two branches, scatter over the vast room a'
murky, fuliginous ray, beneath the light of which the
ﬁerce faces of that Pandaamonium seem more grim and
haggard. There, from the orator’s tribune, shrieks the
shrill wrath of Robespierre!
Meanwhile, all is chaos, disorder, half daring and half
cowardice, in the Committee of his foes. Rumors ﬂy from
street to street, from haunt to haunt, from house to house.
The swallows ﬂit low, and the cattle group together before
the storm. And above this roar of the lives and things
of the little hour, alone in his chamber stood he on whose
starry youth—symbol of the imperishable bloom of the
calm Ideal amidst the moulder/ing Actual—the clouds of
ages had rolled in vain.
All those exertions which ordinary wit and courage
could suggest had been tried in vain. All such exertions
were in vain, where, in that Saturnalia of death, a life
was the object. Nothing but the fall of Robespierre
could have saved his victims; now, too late, that fall
would only serve to avenge.
Once more, in that last agony of excitement and despair,
the Seer had plunged into solitude, to invoke again the
aid or counsel of those mysterious intermediates between
earth and heaven who had renounced the intercourse of
the spirit when subjected to the common bondage of the
mortal. In the intense desire and anguish of his heart,
perhaps, lay a power not yet called forth; for who has
not felt that the sharpness of extreme grief cuts and gridol

which bind down the souls of men to the cabined darkness

And the invocation was heard —the bondage of sense
was rent away from the visual mind. He looked, and
saw—no, not the being he had called, with its limbs of
light and unutterably tranquil smile—not his familiar,
Adou-Ai, the Son of Glory and the Star—but the Evil
Omen, the dark Chimera, the implacable Foe, with exult-
ation and malice burning in its hell-lit eyes. The Spectre,
no longer cowering and retreating into shadow, rose before
him, gigantic and erect,- the face, whose veil no mortal
hand had ever raised, was still concealed, but the form
was more distinct, corporeal, and cast from it, as an atmo-
sphere, horror, and rage, and awe. As an iceberg, the
breath of that presence froze the air; as a cloud, it ﬁlled
the chamber, and blackened the stars from heaven.
“ Lo 1” said Its voice, “I am here once more. Thou
hast robbed me of a meaner prey. Now exorcise thyself
from my power 1 Thy life has left thee, to live in the heart
of a daughter of the charnel and the worm. In that life

Brighter and more devouringly burnt the glare from
those lurid eyes; more visible and colossal yet rose the
dilating shape; a yet ﬁercer and more disdainful hate
spoke in the voice that answered-“Didst thou think
that my boon would be other than thy curse? Happy

seize and wrap thee with the pestilence of my presence;
now, evermore, till thy long race is run, mine eyes shall
glow into thy brain, and mine arms shall clasp thee, when
thou wouldst take the wings of the Morning, and flee
from the embrace of Night!”
“ I tell thee, no ! And again I compel thee, speak and
answer to the lord who can command his slave. I know,
though my lore fails me, and the reeds on which I leaned
pierced my side, I know yet that it is written that the life
of which I question can be saved from the headsman.
Thou wrappest her future in the darkness of thy shadow,

wring the secret, though it torture thee to name it. I

soul that loves can dare all things. Shadow, I defy thee,
and compel!”
The spectre waned and recoiled. Like a vapor that
lessens as the sun pierces and pervades it, the form shrunk
cowering and dwarfed in the dimmer distance, and through
the easement again rushed the stars.
“ Yes,” said the Voice, with a faint and hollow accent,
“ thou canst save her from the headsman ; for it is written,
that sacriﬁce can save. Ha! ha l” And the shape again
suddenly diluted into the gloom of its giant stature, and
its ghastly laugh exulted, as if the Foe, a moment baﬁled,
had regained its might. “ Ha! ha l—thou canst save her

“Back! for my soul, in answering thee from depths
where thou canst not hear it, has regained its glory; and
I hear the wings of Adon-Ai gliding musical through the
air.”
He spoke; and, with a low shriek of bellied rage and
hate, the Thing was gone, and through the room rushed
luminous and sudden, the Presence of silvery light.
As the Heavenly visitor stood in the atmosphere of his
own lustre, and looked upon the face of the Theurgist with
an aspect of ineﬂ'able tenderness and love, all space seemed
lighted from his smile. ' Along the blue air without, from
that chamber in which his wings had halted, to the farthest
star in the azure distance, it seemed as if the track of his
ﬂight were visible, by a lengthened splendor in the air,
like the column of moon-light on the sea. Like the ﬂower
that diﬂ'uses perfume as the very breath of its life, so the
emanation of that presence was joy. Over the world, as
a million times swifter than light, than electricity, the Son
of Glory had sped his way to the side of love, his wings
had scattered delight as the morning scatters dew Fm

ﬂed from its prey, and Hope breathed a dream of Heaven
into the darkness of Despair.
“Thou art right,” said the melodious Voice. “ Thy
courage has restored thy power. Once more, in the haunts
of earth, thy soul charms me to thy side. Wiser now, in
the moment when thou comprehendest Death, than when
thy unfettered spirit learned the solemn mystery of Life;
the human affections that thralled and humbled thee awhile
bring to thee, in these last hours of thy mortality, the
sublimest heritage of thy race--tl1e eternity that com-
mences from the grave.”
“ O Aidon-Ai,” said the Chaldaean, as, circumfused in
the splendor of the visitant, a glory more radiant than
’ human beauty settled round his‘form, and seemed already
to belong to the eternity of which the Bright One spoke,
“ as men, before they die, see and comprehend the enigmas
hidden from them, before,* so in this hour, when the sac-
riﬁce of self to another brings the course of ages to its
goal, I see the littleness of Life, compared to the majesty
of Death; but oh, Divine Consoler, even here, even in

reproof in the tone of celestial pity, “ what, with all thy

Zanoni bowed his head ; and when he looked up again,
the last shadow had left his brow. The-visitor was gone ;
but still the glory of his presence seemed to shine upon
the spot; still the solitary air seemed to murmur with
tremulous delight: And thus ever shall it be with those
who have once, detaching themselves utterly from life,
received the visit of the Angel FAITH. Solitude and space
retain the splendor, and it settles like a halo round their

HE stood upon the lofty balcony that overlooked the
quiet city. Though, afar, the ﬁercest passions of men
were at work on the web of strife and doom, all that gave
itself to his view was calm and still in the rays of the
summer moon, for his soul was wrapped from man and
man’s narrow sphere, and only the serener glories of crea-
tion were present to the vision of the Seer. There he
stood alone and thoughtful, to take the last farewell of
the wondrous life that he had known.
Coursing through the ﬁelds of space, he beheld the
gossamer shapes, whose choral joys his spirit had so often
shared. There, group upon group, they circled in the
starry silence, multiform in the unimaginable beauty of a
being fed by ambrosial dews and serenest light. In his
trance, all the universe stretched visible beyond; in the
green valleys afar, he saw the dances of the fairies; in

the bowels of the mountains, he beheld the race that breathe
the lurid air of the volcanoes, and hide from the light of
Heaven ; on every leaf in the numberless forests, in every
drop of the unmeasured seas, be surveyed its separate
and swarming world; far up, in the farthest blue, he saw
orb upon orb ripening into shape, and planets starting
from the central ﬁre, to run their day of ten thousand
years. For everywhere in creation is the breath of the
Creator, and in every spot where the breath breathes is
life l And alone, in the distance, the lonely man beheld

eyes and his heart, penetrating the dismal dungeon, rested
on his child. He saw it slumbering in the arms of the
pale mother, and his soul spoke to the sleeping soul.

From his numbers and his Cabala, in his cell, amidst
the wrecks of Rome, Mejnour, startled, looked up, and,
through the spirit, felt that the spirit of his distant friend
addressed him.
“Fare thee well for ever upon this earth! Thy last

youth of all; and the Final Day shall ﬁnd thee still the
contemplator of our tombs. I go with my free will into
the land of darkness; but new suns and systems blaze

CHAPTER XV.
Us ne veulent plus perdre un moment d’une unit si précieuse.ilv
LACBETELLE, tom. xii.
IT was late that night, and Réné-Francois Dumas,
President of the Revolutionary Tribunal, had re~entered
his cabinet, on his return from the J acobin club. With
him were two men who might be said to represent, the
one the moral, the other the physical force of the Reign
of Terror: Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Accuser, and
Francois Henriot, the General of the Parisian National
‘ Guard. This formidable triumvirate were assembled to
debate on the proceedings of the next day; and the three
sister-witches, over their hellish caldron, were scarcely
animated by a more ﬁend-like spirit, or engaged in more
execrable designs, than these three heroes of the Revolu-
tion in their premeditated massacre of the morrow.
Dumas was but little altered in appearance since, in the
earlier part of this narrative, he was presented to the
reader, except that his manner was somewhat more short
and severe, and his eye yet more restless. But he seemed
almost a superior being by the side of his associates.
Rene-Dumas, born of respectable parents, and well edu-
cated, despite his ferocity, was not without a certain re-
ﬁnement, which perhaps rendered him the more acceptable

to the precise and formal Robespierre.* But Henriot
had been alackey, a thief, a spy of the police; he had
drunk the blood of Madame de Lamballe, and had risen
to his present rank for no quality but his ruﬁianism; and
Fouquier-Tinville, the son of a provincial agriculturist,
and afterwards a clerk at the Bureau of the Police, was
little less base in his manners, and yet more, from a certain
loathsome buﬁ'oonery, revolting in his speech ; bull-headed,
with black, sleek hair, with a narrow and livid forehead,
with small eyes, that twinkled with a sinister malice;
strong and coarsely built, he looked what he was, the
audacious Bully of a lawless and relentless Bar.
Dumas trimmed the candles, and bent over the list of
the victims for the morrow.
“It is a long catalogue,” said the President; “eighty -
trials for one day l And Robespierre’s orders to despatch
the whole fournée are unequivocal.”
“Pooh!” said Fouquier, with a coarse, loud laugh;
“ we must try them en masse. I know how to deal with
our jury. ‘ Je pense, Citoyens, que vous étes convaz'ncus
du crime des accuses?’1' Ha l ha l—the longer the list,
the shorter the work.”
“ Oh, yes,” growled out Henriot, with an oath, — as
usual, half-drunk, and lolling on his chair, with his spurred
heels on the table—“ little Tinville is the man for des-
patch.”

* Dumas was a bean in his way. His gala-dress was a blood-red
coal, with the ﬁnest ruﬂles.

" Citizen Henriot,” said Dumas, gravely, “permit me
to request thee to select another footstool; and for the
rest, let me warn thee that to-morrow is a critical and
important day ; one that will decide the fate of France.”
“ A ﬁg for little France ! Vine le vertueua: Robespierre,
la Colonne de la Bépublique .' * Plague on this talking ;'
it is dry work Hast thou no eau de vie in that little
cupboard ? ”
Dumas and Fouquier exchanged looks of disgust. Dn-
mas shrugged his shoulders, and replied——
“ It is to guard thee against eau de vie, Citizen General
Henriot, that I have requested thee to meet me here.
Listen if thou canstl”
“ Oh, talk away! thy mét'ier is to talk, mine to ﬁght
and to drink.”
“To-morrow, I tell thee then, the populace will be

that they will even seek to arrest our tumbrils on their
way to the guillotine. Have thy men armed and ready;
keep the streets clear; cut down without mercy whom-
soever may obstruct the ways."
“I understand,” said Henriot, striking his sword so
loudly that Dumas halllstarted at the clank—“ Black
Heuriot is no ‘Indulgent.”’
“ Look to it, then, Citizen—look to it! And hark
thee,” he added, with a grave and sombre brow, “if thou
wouldst keep thine own head on thy shoulders, beware of
the eau de vie.”

“ My own head l— sacre mille tonnerres! Dost thou
threaten the General of the Parisian army?”
Dumas, like Robespierre, a precise, atrabilious, and
arrogant man, was about to retort, when the craftier Tin~
ville laid his hand on his arm, and, turning to the General,
' said, “My dear Henriot, thy dauntless republicanism,
which is too ready to give offence, must learn to take a
reprimand from the representative of Republican Law.
Seriously, 'mon cher, thou must be sober for the next three
or four days; after the crisis is over, thou and I will drink
a bottle together. Come, Dumas, relax thine austerity,
and shake hands with our friend. No quarrels amongst
ourselves l”
Dumas hesitated, and extended his hand, which the
ruﬁian clasped ; and, maudlin tears succeeding his ferocity,
be half sobbed, half hiccupped forth his protestations 0f
civism and his promises of sobriety.
“Well, we depend on thee, mon Général,” said Dumas;
“ and now, since we shall all have need of vigor for to-
morrow, go home and sleep soundly.”
“ Yes, I forgive thee, Dumas- -I forgive thee. I am not
vindictive—Ii but still, if a man threatens me—if a man
insults me ”-_And, with the quick changes of intoxication,
again his eyes gleamed ﬁre through their foul tears. With
some difﬁculty Fouquicr succeeded at last in soothing the
brute, and leading him from the chamber. But still, as
some wild beast disappointed of a prey, he growled and
snarled, as his heavy tread descended the stairs. A tall
trooper, mounted, was leading Henriot’s horse to and fro

the streets; and as the General waited at the porch till
his attendant turned, a stranger stationed by the wall ac-
costed him —
“ General Henriot, I have desired to speak with thee.
Next to Robespierre, thou art, or shouldst be, the most
powerful man in France.”
“ Hem l—yes, I ought to be. What then i-every
man has not his deserts!"
“ Hist l ” said the stranger; “thy pay is scarcely suit-
able to thy rank and thy wants.”
“That is true.”
“Even in a revolution, a man takes care of his fortunes l”
“Diable! speak out, Citizen.”
“ I have a thousand pieces of gold with me - they are
thine, if thou wilt grant me one small favor.”
“Citizen, I grant it i ” said Henriot, waving his hand
majestically. “Is it to denounce some rascal who has
oﬂ‘ended thee ?”
“No ; it is simply this: — write these words to Presi-
dent Dumas —‘Admit the bearer to thy presence ; and if
thou canst grant him the request he will make to thee, it
will be an inestimable obligation to Francois Henriot.”'
The stranger, as he spoke, placed pencil and tablets in
the shaking hands of the soldier.
“And where is the gold?”
“ Here.”
With some difﬁculty, Henriot scrawled the words dic-
tated to him, clutched the gold, mounted his horse,-and
was gone.

Meanwhile Fouquier, when he had closed the door upon
Henriot, said sharply —“ How canst thou be so mad as
to incense that brigand? Knowest thou not that our
laws are nothing without the physical force of the National
Guard, and that he is their leader ? ”
“I know this, that Robespierre must have been mad
to place that drunkard at their head ; and mark my words,
Fouquier, if the struggle come, it is that man’s incapacity
and cowardice that will destroy us. Yes, thou mayst live
thyself to accuse thy beloved Robespierre, and to perish
in his fall.”
“For all that, we must keep well with Henriot till we
can ﬁnd the occasion to seize and behead him. To be
safe, we must fawn on those who are still in power; and ‘
fawn the more, the more we would depose them. Do
not think this Heuriot, when he wakes to-morrow, will
forget thy threats. He is the most revengeful of human
beings. Thou must send and soothe him in the morning l”
“Right,” said Dumas, convinced. “ I was too hasty;
and now I think we have nothing further to do, since we
have arranged to make short work with our fournée of
to-morrow. I see in the list a knave I have long marked
out, though his crime once procured me a legacy—Nicot, '
the Hébertist.”
“And young André Chenier, the Poet. Ah, I forgot;

“ There is a foreigner—an Italian woman in the list;
but I can ﬁnd no charge made out against her.”
“All the same; we must execute her for the sake of the
round number; eighty sounds better than seventy-nine l”
Here a huissier brought a paper, on which was written
the request of Henriot.
“Ah! this is fortunate,” said Tinville, to whom Dumas
chucked the scroll —“ grant the prayer by all means; so
at least that it does not lessen our bead-roll. But I will
do Henriot the justice to say, that he never asks to let off,
but to put on. Good night ! I am worn out—my escort
waits below. Only on such an occasion would I venture
forth in the streets at night.”* And Fouquier, with a
long yawn, quitted the room.
“Admit the bearer l” said Dumas, who, withered and
dried, as lawyers in practice mostly are, seemed to require
as little sleep as his parchments.
The stranger entered.
“ Rene-Francois Dumas,” said he, seating himself op~
posite to the President, and markedly adopting the plural,

cry aloud —“Si mon frere est coupable, qu’il perisse.” (If my
brother be culpable, let him die.) This brother, Marie-Joseph, also
a poet, and the author of “ Charles IX.,” so celebrated in the earlier
days of the Revolution, enjoyed, of course, according to the wanted
justice of the world, a triumphant career; and was proclaimed in
the Champ de Mars, “ le premier des petites Franeais," a title due
to his murdered brother.
* During the latter part of the Reign of Terror, Fouquier rarely
stirred out at night, and never without an escort. In the Reign of
Terror, those most terriﬁed were its kings.

as if in contempt of the revolutionary jargon; “amidst
the excitement and occupations of your later life, I know
not if you can remember that we have met before ? ”
The judge scanned the features of his visitor, and a
pale blush settled on his sallow cheeks-“Yes, Citizen, I
remember i ”
“And you recall the words I then uttered ! You spoke
tenderly and philanthropically of your horror of capital
executions — you exulted in the approaching revolution
as the termination of all sanguinary punishments—you
quoted reverently the saying of Maximilien Robespierre,
the rising statesman, ‘the executioner is the invention of
the tyrant ;’ and I replied, that while you spoke, a fore-
boding seized me that we should meet again when your
ideas of death and the philosophy of revolutions might
be changed l Was I right, Citizen Rene-Francois Dumas,
President of the Revolutionary Tribunal?”
“ Pooh i” said Dumas, with some confusion on his
brazen brow. “I spoke then as men speak who have
not acted. Revolutions are not made with rose-water!
But truce to the gossip of the long-ago. I remember,
also, that thou didst then save the life of my relation, and
it will please thee to learn that his intended murderer will
be guillotined to-morrow.”
“ That concerns yourself—your justice or your revenge.
Permit me the egotism to remind you, that you then pro-
mised that if ever a day should come when you could
serve me, your life—yes, the phrase was, ‘your heart’s
blood ’-_ was at my bidding. Think not, austere judge,

that I come to ask a boon that can aﬁ‘ect yourself—I
come but to ask a day’s respite for another!”
“ Citizen, it is impossible l I have the order of Robes-
pierre that not one less than the total on my list must
undergo their trial for to-morrow. As for the verdict,
that rests with the juryl”
“I do not ask you to diminish the catalogue. Listen
still! In your death-roll there is the name of an Italian
woman, whose youth, whose beauty, and whose freedom,
not only from every crime, but every tangible charge, will
excite only compassion, and not terror. Even you would
tremble to pronounce her sentence. It will be dangerous
on a day when the populace will be excited, when your
tumbrils may be arrested, to expose youth and innocence
and beauty to the pity and courage of a revolted crowd.”
Dumas looked up, and shrunk from the eye of the
stranger.
“I do not deny, Citizen, that there is reason in what
thou urgest. But my orders are positive.”
“Positive only as to the number of the victims. I oﬁ'er
you a substitute for this one. I oﬁ'er you the head of a
man who knows all of the very conspiracy which now
threatens Robespierre and yourself; and compared with
one clue to which, you would think even eighty ordinary
lives a cheap purchase.”
“ That alters the case,” said Dumas, eagerly; "if thou
canst do this, on my own responsibility I will postoons
the trial of the Italian. New name the proxy l ”
“You behold him!”

“ Thou !” exclaimed Dumas, while a fear he could not
conceal betrayed itself through his surprise. “Thou i-
and thou comest to me alone at night to offer thyself to
justice. Ha l—this is a snare. Tremble, fool l—thou
art in my power, and I can have both! ”
“You can,” said the stranger, with a calm smile of
disdain ; “but my life is valueless without my revelations.
Sit still, I command you—hear me!” and the light in
those dauntless eyes spell-bound and awed the judge.
“ You will remove me to the Concergierie—you will ﬁx
my trial, under the name of Zanoni, amidst yourfournée
of to-morrow. If I do not satisfy you by my speech,
you hold the woman I die to save as your hostage. It is
but the reprieve for her of a single day that I demand.
The day following the morrow, I shall be dust, and you
may wreak your vengeance on the life that remains.
Tush ! Judge and condemner of thousands, do you hesi-

himself to death, will be daunted into uttering one syllable
at your bar against his will? Have you not had expe-

cloud, in this lurid atmosphere, hangs the storm that shall
burst on Robespierre and his reign l”
Dumas grew pale; and his eyes vainly sought to escape
the magnetic gaze that overpowered and mastered him.
Mechanically, and as if under an agency not his own, he
wrote while the stranger dictated.
“Well,” he said, then, forcing a smile to his lips; “ I
promised I would serve you; see, I am faithful to my
word. I suppose that you are one of those fools of feel- _
ing—those professors of anti-revolutionary virtue, of
whom I have seen not a few before my bar. Faughl it
sickens me to see those who make a merit of incivism, and
perish to save some bad patriot, because it is a son, or a
father, or a wife, or a daughter, who is saved.”
“ I am one of those fools of feeling,” said the stranger,
rising. “You have divined aright.”
“And wilt thou not, in return for my mercy, utter to-
night the revelations thou wouldst proclaim to-morrow ?
Come; and, perhaps, thou too—nay, the woman also,
may receive, not reprieve, but pardon.”

not; and even while I show the cloud, the bolt may fall. "

“Ay, too late, President,” echoed the calm visitor.
“But, remember, it is not pardon, it is but a day’s re-
prieve, I have promised to this woman. According as
thou dost satisfy me to-morrow, she lives or dies. I am

VIOLA was in the prison, that opened not but for those

Zanoni, her very intellect had seemed paralyzed. All that
beautiful exuberance of fancy, which if not the fruit of
genius, seemed its blossoms: all that gush of exquisite
thought, which Zanoni had justly told her ﬂowed with
mysteries and subtleties ever new to him, the wise one;
all were gone, annihilated; the blossom withered, the

hood, she seemed listlessly to sink into something below
childhood. With the inspirer the inspirations had ceased ;
and, in deserting love, genius also was left behind.
She scarcely comprehended why she had been thus torn
from her home and the mechanism of her dull tasks. She
scarcely knew what meant those kindly groups, that, struck
with her exceeding loveliness, had gathered round her in
the prison, with mournful looks, but with words of com-
fort. She, who had hitherto been taught to abhor those
whom Law condemns for crime, was amazed to hear that
beings thus compassionate and tender, with cloudless and
lofty brows, with gallant and gentle mien, were criminals,
for whom Law had no punishment short of death. But
they, the savages, gaunt and menacing, who had dragged
her from her home, who had attempted to snatch from
her the infant, while she clasped it in her arms, and
laughed ﬁerce scorn at her mute quivering lips-THEY

to Renown, to Beauty; and Strength, with its own inborn
chivalry, raised into rank the helpless and the weak. The
iron sinews, and the Herculean shoulders, made way for
the woman and the child; and the graces of Humanity,
lost elsewhere, sought their refuge in the abode of Terror.
“ And wherefore, my child, do they bring thee hither ? ”
asked an old grey-haired priest.
“I cannot guess.”
“ Ah 1 if you know not your offence, fear the worst.”
“ And my child if ” (for the infant was still suﬁ'ered to

“ Alas, young mother ! they will suﬂ'er thy child to live. ”
“ And for this—an orphan in the dungeon l” murmured
the accusing heart of Viola, “have I reserved his off-
spring! Zanoni, even in thought, ask not—ask not what
I have done with the child I bore theel”
Night came; the crowd rushed to the grate, to hear
the muster-roll.* Her name was with the doomed. And
the old priest, better prepared to die, but reserved from
the death-list, laid his hands on her head, and blessed her
while he wept. She heard, and wondered; but she did
not weep. With downcast eyes, with arms folded on her
bosom, she bent submissively to the call. But now,
another name was uttered; and a man, who had pushed
rudely past her, to gaze or to listen, shrieked'out a how]
of despair and rage. She turned, and their eyes met.
Through the distance of time, she recognized that hideous
aspect. Nicot’s face settled back into its devilish sneer.

She was placed in her gloomy cell, to await the mor-
row. But the child was still spared her; and she thought
it seemed as if conscious of the awful Present. In their
way to the prison, it had not moaned or wept; it had
looked with its clear eyes, unshrinking, on the gleaming
pikes and savage brows of the huiss'iers. And now, alone
in the dungeon, it put its arms round her neck, and mur-
mured its indistinct sounds, low and sweet as some un-
known language of consolation and of heaven. And of
heaven it was l for, at the murmur, the terror melted from
her soul: upward, from the dungeon and the death ——
upward, where the happy cherubim chant the mercy of
the All-loving, whispered that cherub’s voice. She fell
upon her knees and prayed. The despoilers of all that
beautiﬁes and hallows life had desecrated the altar, and
denied the God I — they had removed from the last hour
of their victims the Priest, the Scripture, and the Cross!
But Faith builds in the dungeon and the lazar-house its
sublimest shrines; and up, through roofs of stone, that
shut out the eye of Heaven, ascends the ladder where the
angels glide to and fro—PRAYER.

through the human tears, a light as from above was mir~

With a cry, never, perhaps, heard before in that gloomy
vault—a cry. of delight and rapture, she sprung forward,
and fell at his feet.
He bentdown to raise her; but she slid from his arms. He
called her by the familiar epithets of the old endearment,
and she only answered him by sobs. Wildly, passionately,
she kissed his hands, the hem of his garment, but voice
was gone.
“ Look up, look up i— I am here— I am here to save
thee! Wilt thou deny to me thy sweet face? Truant,
wouldst thou ﬂy me still?”
“ Fly thee l ” she said, at last, and in a broken voice;
“ oh, if my thoughts wronged thee — oh, if my dream, that
awful dream, deceived-kneel down with me, and pray
for our child 1 ” Then, springing to her feet with a sudden
impulse, she caught up the infant, and placing it in his
arms, sobbed forth, with deprecating and humble tones,
“Not for my sake—not for mine, did I abandon thee,
but ”
“Hush l ” said Zanoni ; “ I know all the thoughts that
thy confused and struggling senses can scarcely analyze
themselves. And see how, with a look, thy child answers
them i ”
And in truth the face of that strange infant seemed

radiant with its silent and unfathomable joy. It seemed
as if it recognized the father ; it clung— it forced itself
to his breast, and there, nestling, turned its bright clear
eyes upon Viola, and smiled. _

thoughts of souls that would aspire as mine, are all
prayer! ” And, seating himself by her side, he began to
reveal to her some of the holier secrets of his lofty being.
He spoke of the sublime and intense faith from which
alone the diviner knowledge can arise _the faith which,
seeing the immortal everywhere, puriﬁes and exalts the
mortal that beholds—the glorious ambition that dwells
not in the cabals and crimes of earth, but amidst those
solemn wonders that speak not of men, but of God, — of
that power to abstract the soul from the clay which gives
to the eye of the soul its subtle vision, and to the soul’s
wing the unlimited realm—of that pure, severe, and daring
initiation, from which the mind emerges, as from death,
into clear perceptions of its kindred with the Father-Prin-
ciples of life and light, so that, in its own sense of the
Beautiful, it ﬁnds its joy! in the serenity of its will, its
power; in its sympathy with the youthfulness ofthe Inﬁnite
Creation, of which itself is an essence and a part, the secrets
that embalm the very clay which they consecrate, and renew
the strength of life with the amhrosia of mysterious and
celestial sleep. And while he spoke, Viola listened, breath-
less. If she could not comprehend, she no longer dared to
distrust. She felt that in that enthusiasm, self-deceiving
or not, no ﬁend could lurk; and by an intuition, rather
than an effort of the reason, she saw before her, like a
starry ocean, the depth and mysterious beauty of the soul
which her fears had wronged. Yet, when he said (con-
cluding his strange confessions), that to this life within
hfe and above life, he had dreamed to raise her own, the

fear of humanity crept over her, and he read in her silence
how vain, with all his science, would the dream have been.
But now, as he closed, and, leaning on his breast, she
felt the clasp of his protecting arms, —when, in one holy
kiss, the past was forgiven and the present lost,--then
there returned to her the sweet and warm hopes of the
natural life—0f the loving woman. He was come to save
her! She asked not how—she believed it without a ques-
tion. They should be at last again united. They would
ﬂy far from those scenes of violence and blood. Their
happy Ionian isle, their fearless solitudes, would once more
receive them. She laughed, with a child’s joy, as this
picture rose up amidst the gloom of the dungeon l Her
mind, faithful to its sweet, simple instincts, refused to re-
ceive the lofty images that ﬂitted confusedly by it, and
settled back to its human visions, yet more baseless, of the
earthly happiness and the tranquil home.
“Talk not now to me, beloved—talk not more now to
me of the past! Thou art here—thou wilt save me; we
shall live yet the common happy life; that life with thee
is happiness and glory enough to me. Traverse, if thou

dreams ofjoy and beauty; and thine eyes made yet more
beautiful and joyous the world in waking. To-morrow !
-—-why do you not smile? To-morrow, love l is not to—
morrow a blessed wordl Cruel! you would punish me
still, that you will not share my joy. Aha! see our little
one, how it laughs to my eyes i I will talk to that. Child,
thy father is come backl”
And taking the infant in her arms, and seating herself
at a little distance, she rocked it to and fro on her bosom,
and prattled to it, and kissed it between every word; and
laughed and wept by ﬁts, as ever and anon she cast over
her shoulder her playful, mirthful glance, upon the father
to whom those fading stars smiled sadly their last farewell.
How beautiful she seemed as she thus sat, unconscious of
the futurel Still half a child herself, her child laughing
to her laughter—two soft triﬁers on the brink of the
grave! Over her throat, as she bent, fell, like a golden
cloud, her redundant hair; it covered her treasure like a
veil of light ; and the child’s little hands put it aside from
time to time, to smile through the parted tresses, and then
to cover its face and peep and smile again. It were cruel
to damp that joy, more cruel still to share it.
“Viola,” said Zanoni, at last, “dost thou remember
that, seated by the cave on the moonlit beach, in our bri-
dal isle, thou once didst ask me for this amulet f—the
charm of a superstition long vanished from the world, with
the creed to which it belonged. It is the last relic of my
native land, and my mother, on her death-bed, placed it

round my neck. I’told thee then I would give it thee on
that day when the laws of our being should become the
same.”
"I remember it well.”
“To-morrow it shall be thine l”_
“ Ah, that'dear to-morrow l ” And, gently laying down
her child,—for it slept now, —she threw herself on his
breast, and pointed to the dawn that began greyly to
creep along the skies.
There, in those horror-breathing walls, the day-star
looked through the dismal bars upon those three beings,
in whom were concentered whatever is most tender in
human ties ; whatever is most mysterious in the combina-
tions of the human mind; the sleeping Innocence; the
trustful Aﬁ'ection, that, contented with a touch, a breath,
can foresee no sorrow ; the weary Science that, traversing
all the secrets of creation, comes at last to Death for their
solution, and still clings, as it nears the threshold, to the
breast of Love. Thus, within, the within—a dungeon,
without, the without—stately with marts and balls, with
palaces and temples—Revenge and Terror, at their
dark schemes and counter-schemes-to and fro, upon
the tide of the shifting passions, reeled the destinies of
men and nations; and hard at hand that day-star, waning
into space, looked with impartial eye on the church
tower and the guillotine. Up springs the blithesome
morn. In yon gardens the birds renew their familiar
song. The ﬁshes are sporting through the freshening
waters of the Seine. The gladness of divine nature, the

roar and dissonance of mortal life, awake again; the
trader unbars his windows-the ﬂower-girls troop gaily
to their haunts—busy feet are tramping to the daily
drudgeries that revolutions which strike down kings and
kaisars, leave the same Cain’s heritage to the boor—the
'wagons groan and reel to the mart—Tyranny, up be-
times, holds its pallid levee—Conspiracy, that hath not
slept, hears the clock, and whispers to its own heart,
“The hour draws near.” A group gather, eager-eyed,
round the purlieus ofthe Convention Hall; to-day decides
the sovereignty of France—about the courts of the
Tribunal their customary burn and stir. No matter what
the hazard of the die, or who the ruler, this day eighty
heads shall fall!

And she slept s0 sweetly! Wearied out with joy, se-
cure in the presence of the eyes regained, she had laughed
and wept herself to sleep; and still, in that slumber, there
seemed a happy consciousness that the Loved was by--
the Lost was found. For she smiled and murmured to
herself, and breathed his name often, and stretched out
her arms, and sighed if they touched him not. He gazed
upon her as he stood apart—with what emotions it were
vain to say. She would wake no more to him—she could
not know how dearly the safety of that sleep was pur-
chased. That morrow she had so yearned for,—— it had
come at last. How would she greet the eve? Amidst
all the exquisite hopes with which love and youth contem-
plate the future. her eyes had closed. Those hopes still

lent their iris-colors to her dreams. She would wake to
live! To-morrow, and the Reign of Terror was no more
—the prison gates would be opened—she would go forth,
with their child, into that summer-world of light. And
he?—--he turned, and his eye fell upon the child ; it was
broad awake, and that clear, serious, thoughtful look
which it mostly wore, watched him with a solemn steadi-
ness. He bent over and kissed its lips.
“ Never more,” he murmured, “ O heritor of love and
grief—never more wilt thou see me in thy visions—never
more will the light of those eyes be fed by celestial com-
mune—never more can my soul guard from thy pillow
the trouble and the disease. Not such as I would have
vainly shaped it, must be thy lot. In common with thy
race, it must be thine to suffer, to struggle, and to err.
But mild be thy human trials, and strong be thy spirit, to
love and to believe! And thus, as I gaze upon thee-
thus may my nature breathe into thine its last and most
intense desire ; may my love for thy mother pass to thee,
and in thy looks may she hear my spirit comfort and con- -
sole her. Hark! they come l—Yesl I await ye both
beyond the gravel”
The door slowly opened ; the gaoler appeared, and
through the aperture rushed, at the same instant, a ray
of sun-light—it streamed over the fair, hushed face of the
happy sleeper—it played like a smile upon the lips of the
child, that still, mute and steadfast, watched the move-
ments of its father. At that moment Viola muttered in
her sleep—“ The day is come—the gates are open ! Give

How the sunshine plays upon the watersl—to home,
beloved one! to home again.”
“Citizen, thine hour is come!”
“ Hist !—she sleeps! A moment! There! it is done!
thank Heaven l-and still she sleeps l ” He would not
kiss, lest he should awaken her, but gently placed round
her neck the amulet that would speak to her, hereafter,
the farewell; _and promise, in that farewell—reunion !
He is at the threshold ——he turns again, and again. The
door closes! He is gone for ever!
She woke at last—she gazed round. “Zanoni, it is
day l ” No answer but the low wail of her child. Merciful
heaven ! was it then all a dream? She tossed back the
long tresses that must veil her sight-she felt the amulet
on her bosom—it was no dream 1 “Oh, God l and he is
gone 1” She sprung to the door—she shrieked aloud.
The gaoler comes. “My husband, my child’s father f”
~“He is gone before thee, woman!”
“Whither? Speak — speak l”
“ To the guillotine l”_and the black door closed again.
It closed upon the Senseless! As a lightning-ﬂash,
Zanoni’s words, his sadness, the true meaning of his mystic
gift, the very sacriﬁce he made for her, all became distinct
for a moment to her mind —and then darkness swept on
it like a storm, yet darkness which had its light. And,
while she sat there, mute, rigid, voiceless, as congealed
to stone, a VISION, like a wind, glided over the deeps
within l w the grim court —- the judge -— the jury—the

“I know; and I keep my promise. Judge, I reveal
thy doom l I know that the Anarchy thou callest a
State expires with the setting of this sun. Hark ! to the

They hurry into the court—the hasty and pale mes-
sengers—there is confusion, and fear, and dismay! “ Off
with the conspirator l —and to-morrow the woman thou
wouldst have saved shall die !”
“ To-morrow, President, the steel falls on THEE!”
On, through the crowded and roaring streets, on moves
the Procession of Death. Ha, brave people! thou art
aroused at last. They shall not die l - Death is de-
thronedl—Robespierre has fallen l—they rush to the
rescue! Hideous in the tumbril, by the side of Zanoni,
raved and gesticulated that form which, in his prophetic
dreams, he had seen his companion at the place of death.
“Save usl—save us ! ” howled the atheist Nicot! “ On,
brave populace l we shall be saved ! ” And through the
crowd, her dark hair streaming wild, her eyes ﬂashing
ﬁre, pressed a female form—“My Clarence !” she hrieked,
in the soft southern language, native to the ears of Viola;
“butcher! what hast thou done with Clarence?” Her
eves roved over the eager faces of the prisoners; she saw

Heaven! I am not thy murderess l”
Nearer and nearer press the populace—another moment,
and the deathsman is defrauded. O Zanoni! why still
upon thy brow the resignation that speaks no hope?
Tramp! tramp! through the streets, dash the armed
troop: faithful to his orders, Black Henriot leads them
on. Tramp! tramp! over the craven and scattered
crowd! Here, ﬂying in disorder—there, trampled in
the mire, the shrieking rescuers! And amidst them,
stricken by the sabres of the guard, her long hair blood-
bedabbled, lies the Italian woman; and still upon her
writhing lips sits joy, as they murmur-_“ Clarence! I
have not destroyed thee I”
On to the Barriers du Trdne. It frowns dark in the
air—the giant instrument of murder! One after one to
the glaive ;--another, and another, and another ! Mercy!

so brief?—brief as a sigh? There, there-his turn has
come. “Die not yet; leave me not behind; hear me—
hear me!” shrieked the inspired sleeper. “What! and
thou smilest still ! ” They smiled—those pale lips—;and
with the smile, the place of doom, the headsman. the
horror vanished! With.that smile, all space seemed
suffused in eternal sunshine. Up from the earth he rose
— he hovered over her—a thing not of matter—an IDEA
of joy and light! Behind, Heaven opened, deep after
deep; and the Host-s of Beauty were seen, rank upon
rank, afar; and “Welcome ! ” in a myriad melodies, broke

“Welcomel O puriﬁed by sacriﬁce, and immortal only

the radiant, the IMAGE stretched forth its arms, and murv

So gasp out the prisoners, each to each. Day wanes

mingled With tne very gaolers, who, for fear, would fain
seem Joyous too-they stream through the dens and
alleys of the grim house they will shortly leave. They
burst into a cell, forgotten since the previous morning.
They found there a young female, sitting upon her
wretched bed; her arms crossed upon her bosom, her face
raised upward; the eyes unclosed, and a smile, of more
than serenity—of bliss upon her lips. Even inthe riot
of their joy, they drew back in astonishment and awe.
Never had they seen life so beautiful; and, as they crept
nearer, and with noiseless feet, they saw that the lips
breathed not, that the repose was of marble, that the
beauty and the ecstasy were of death. They gathered
round in silence; and 10! at her feet there was a young
infant, who, wakened by their tread, looked at them stead-
fastly, and with its rosy ﬁngers played with its dead
mother’s robe. An orphan there in the dungeon vault!
“ Poor one 1” said the female (herself a parent) —“and
they say the father fell yesterday ; and now the mother!
Alone in the world, what can be its fate?”
The infant smiled fearlessly on the crowd, as the woman
spoke thus. And the old Priest, who stood amongst
them, said, gently, “Woman, see! the orphan smiles!
Tun FATHERLESS ARE THE CARE or GOD!
THE END.
