 PEEFACE 
 
 The story of Perkiu Warbeck was first suggested to me as a 
 subject for historical detail. On studying it, I became aware of 
 tlie romance wMch his story contains, while, at the same time, 
 I felt that it would be impossible for any narration, that should 
 be confined to the incorporation of facts related by our old 
 Chroniclers, to do it justice. 
 
 It is not singular that I should entertain a belief that Perkin 
 was, in reality, the lost duke of York. For, in spite of Hume, 
 and the later historians who have followed in his path, no person 
 who has at all studied the subject but arrives at the same con- 
 clusion. Records exist in the Tower, some well known, others 
 with which those who have access to those interesting papers 
 are alone acquainted, which put the question almost beyond a 
 doubt. 
 
 This is not the place for a discussion of the question. The 
 principal thing that I should wish to be impressed on my reader's 
 mind is, that whether my hero was or was not an impostor, he 
 was believed to be the true man by his contemporaries. The 
 partial pages of Bacon, of Hall, and Holinshed, and others of 
 that date, are replete with proofs of this fact. There are some 
 curious letters, written by Sir John Eamsay, laird of Balmayne, 
 calling himself Lord Bothwell, addressed to Henry the Seventh 
 himself, which, though written by a spy and hireling of that 
 monarch, tend to confirm my belief, and even demonstrate that 
 in his eagerness to get rid of a formidable competitor, Henry 
 did not hesitate to urge midnight assassination. These letters 
 are printed in the Appendix to Pinkerton's " History of Scot- 
 land." The verses which form the motto to these volumes, are

 part of a rythmical chronicle, written by two subjects of Bur- 
 gundy, who lived in those days ; it is entitled, " Recollection 
 des Merveilles, advenues en nostre temps, commencee par tres 
 elegant orateur, Messire Georges Chastellan, et continuee par 
 Maistre Jean Molinet." 
 
 In addition to the unwilling suffrage of his enemies, we may 
 adduce the acts of his friends and allies. Human nature in its 
 leading features is the same in all ages. James the Fourth of 
 Scotland was a man of great talent and discernment : he was 
 proud ; attached, as a Scot, to the prejudices of birth; of punc- 
 tilious honour. No one can believe that he would have bestowed 
 his near kinswoman, nor have induced the earl of Huntley to 
 give his daughter in marriage to one who did not bear evident 
 signs of being of royal blood. 
 
 The various adventures of this unfortunate prince in many 
 countries, and his alliance with a beautiful and high-born 
 woman, who proved a faithful, loving wife to Tiim, take away 
 the sting from the ignominy which might attach itself to his 
 fate ; and make him, we venture to believe, in spite of the con- 
 tumely later historians have chosen, in the most arbitrary way, 
 to heap upon him, a fitting object of interest — a hero to ennoble 
 the pages of a humble tale.

 He seemed breathless, heartless, faint and wan. 
 And all his armour sprinkled was with blood. 
 And soil'd with dirty gore, that no man can 
 Discern the hue thereof. He never stood, 
 But bent his hasty course towards the idle flood. 
 
 Spenser. 
 
 After a long series of civil dissension — after many battles, 
 wliose issue involved tlie fate of tlioiisands — after the destruction 
 of nearly all the Enf^lish nobility in the contest between the two 
 Eoses, the decisive battle of Bosworth Pield was fought on the 
 22nd of Auijust, 1415, whose result was to entwine, as it was 
 called, the white and red symbols of rivalship, and to restore 
 peace to this unhappy country. 
 
 The day had been sunny and warm : as the evening closed in, 
 a west wind rose, bringing along troops of fleecy clouds, golden 
 at sunset, and then dun and grey, veiling with pervious network 
 the many stars. Three horsemen at this liour passed through 
 the open country between Hinckley and Welford in Leicester- 
 shire. It was broad day when they descended from the elevation 
 on which the former stands, and the villagers crowded to gaze 
 upon the fugitives, and to guess, from the ensigns they bore, to 
 which party they belonged, while the warders from the near 
 castle hastened out to stop them, thus to curry favour with the 
 conqueror ; a design wholly baffled. The good steeds of the 
 knights, for such their golden spurs attested them to be, bore 
 them fast and far along the Eoman road, which still exists in 
 those parts to shame our modern builders. It was dusk when, 
 turning from the direct route to avoid entering Welford, they 
 reached a ford of the Avon. Hitherto silence had prevailed with 
 the party — for until now their anxiety to fly had solely occupied 
 their thoughts. Their appearcince spoke of war, nay, of slaughter. 
 Their cloaks were stained and torn ; their armour was disjointed, 
 and parts of it were wanting ; yet these losses were so arbitrary,

2 THE FLIGHT FROM 
 
 that it was plain that tlie pieces had been hacked from their 
 fastenings. The helm of the foremost was deprived of its crest ; 
 another wore the bonnet of a common soldier, which ill accorded 
 with the rest of his accoutrements ; while the third, bareheaded, 
 his hair fallings on his shoulders, lank and matted from heat and 
 exercise, gave more visible tokens of the haste of flight. As the 
 night grew darker, one of them, and then another, seemed willing 
 to relax somewhat in their endeavours : one alone continued, 
 with unmitigated energy, to keep his horse at the same pace 
 they had all maintained during the broad light of day. 
 
 When they reached the ford, the silence was broken by the 
 hindmost horseman ; he spoke in a petulant voice, saying :— 
 *' Another half mile at this pace, and poor Flceur-de-Luce foun- 
 ders ; if you will not slacken your speed, here we part, my 
 friends. God save you till we meet again ! " 
 
 "Evil betide the hour that separates us, brother! " said the 
 second fugitive, reining in ; " our cause, our peril, our fate shall 
 be the same. You, my good lord, will consult your own safety." 
 
 The third cavalier had already entered the stream : he made a 
 dead halt while his friends spoke, and then replied : — " Let us 
 name some rendezvous where, if we escape, we may again meet. 
 I go on an errand of life and death : my success is doubtful, 
 my danger certain. If I succeed in evading it, where shall I 
 rejoin you ? " 
 
 " Though the event of this day has been fatal to the king," 
 answered the other, " our fortunes are not decided. I propose 
 taking refuge in some sanctuary, till we perceive how far the earl 
 of Richmond is inclined to mercy." 
 
 " I knew the earl when a mere youth, Sir Humphrey Staf- 
 ford," said the foremost rider, " and heard more of him when I 
 visited Brittany, at the time of King Louis's death, two years 
 ago. When mercy knocks at his heart, suspicion and avarice 
 give her a rough reception. We must fly beyond sea, unless we 
 can make further stand. More of this when we meet again. 
 Where shall that be ? " 
 
 " I have many friends near Colchester," replied the elder 
 Stafford, " and St. Mary boasts an asylum there which a crowned 
 head would not dare violate. Thence, if all else fail, we can 
 pass with ease to the Low Countries." 
 
 " In sanctuary at Colchester — I will not fail you. God bless 
 and preserve you the while ! " 
 
 The noble, as he said these words, put spurs to his horse, and 
 without looking back, crossed the stream, and turning on the 
 skirts of a copse, was soon out of sight of his companions. He 
 rode all night, cheering his steed with hand and voice ; looking 
 angrily at the early dawning east, which soon cast from her

 cloudless brow the dimness of night. Yet the morning air was 
 grateful to his heated cheeks. It was a perfect summer's 
 morn. The wheat, golden from ripeness, swayed gracefu.ly to 
 the light breeze ; the slender oats shook their small bells in the 
 air with ceaseless motion ; the birds, twittering, alighted from 
 the ftdl-leaved trees, scattering dew-drops from the bra aches. 
 With the earliest dawn, the cavalier entered a forest, traversing 
 its depths with the hesitation of one unacquainted with the 
 country, and looked frequently at the sky, to be directed by the 
 position of the glowing east. A path more worn than the one he 
 had hitherto followed now presented itself, leading into the 
 heart of the wood. He hesitated for a few seconds, and then, 
 with a word of cheer to his horse, pursued bis way into the 
 embowering thicket. After a short space the path narrowed, 
 the meeting branches of the trees impeded him, and the sudden 
 angle it made from the course he wished to follow, served to 
 perplex him still farther ; but as he vented his impatience by 
 hearty Catholic exclamations, a little tinkling bell spoke of a 
 chapel near, and of the early rising of the priest to perform the 
 matin service at its altar. The horse of the fugitive, a noble 
 "war-steed, had long flagged ; and hunger gnawed at the rider's 
 own heart, for he had not tasted food since the morning of the 
 previous day. These sounds, therefore, heard in so fearless a 
 seclusion, bore with them pleasant tidings of refreshment and 
 repose. He crossed himself in thankfulness ; then throwing 
 himself from his horse (and such change was soothing to his 
 stiffened limbs), he led him through the opening glade to where 
 a humble chapel and a near adjoining hut stood in the bosom of 
 the thicket, emblems of peace and security. 
 
 The cavalier tied his horse to a tree, and entered the chapel. 
 A venerable priest was reading the matin service ; one old woman 
 composed his congregation, and she was diligently employed 
 telling her beads. The bright rays of the newly-risen sun 
 streamed through the eastern window, casting the chequered 
 shadow of its lattice-work on the opposite wall. The chapel 
 was small and rustic ; but it was kept exquisitely clean : the 
 sacred appurtenances of the altar also were richer than was 
 usual, and each shrine was decked with clusters of flowers, 
 chiefly composed of white roses. No high praise, indeed, was 
 due to the rude picture of the Virgin of the Annunciation, or of 
 the Announcing Angel, a representation of whom formed the 
 altar-piece ; but in barbaric England, in those days, piety stood 
 in place of taste, and that which represented Our Lady received 
 honour, however unworthy it might be of the inspiress of 
 Raphael or Correggio. The cavalier took his disornamented 
 casque from his head, placed it on the ground, and knelt reveren-

 tially on the bare earfcli. He had lately escaped from battle and 
 slaughter, and he surely thought that he had especial motive for 
 thanksgiving ; so that if his lips uttered a mere soldier's " Ave," 
 still it had the merit of fervour and sincerity. 
 
 Had he been less occupied by his own feelings, he might have 
 remarked the many glances the priest cast on him, who dis- 
 honoured his learning and piety by frequent mistakes of lan- 
 guage, as his thoughts wandered from his breviary, to observe 
 with deep attention his unexpected visitor. At length the 
 service ended : the old dame rose from her knees, and satisfied 
 her curiosity, which she had excited by many a look askance, by a 
 full and long gaze on the cavalier. His hewn armour, torn cloak, 
 and, unseemly for the sacred spot, the dread stains on his gar- 
 ments and hands, were all minutely scanned. Nor did his per- 
 sonal appearance escape remark. His stature was tall, his person 
 well knit, showing him to be a man of about thirty years of age. 
 His features were finely moulded, his grey eyes full of fire, his 
 step had the dignity of rank, and his look expressed chivalrous 
 courage and frankness. The good woman had not been long 
 engaged in surveying the stranger, when her pastor beckoned 
 her to retire, and himself advanced, replying to the soldier's 
 salute with a benedicite, and then hastily inquiring if he came 
 from the field. 
 
 "Even so, father," said the cavalier ; " I come from the field 
 of the bloody harvest. Has any intelligence of it travelled 
 hither so speedily ? If so, I must have wandered from the right 
 road, and am not so far on my journey as I hoped." 
 
 " I have only heard that a battle was expected," s.iid the 
 priest, " and your appearance tells me that it is over. The for- 
 tunes, nay, perhaps the life of a dear friend are involved in its 
 issue, and I fear that it is adverse — for you fly from pursuit, and 
 methinks, though stained with dust and blood, that emblem on 
 your breast is the White E-ose." 
 
 The warrior looked on the old man, whose dignity and language 
 were at variance with his lowly destination ; he looked partly in 
 wonder, and partly to assure himself of his questioner's sin- 
 cerity. "You are weary, Sir Enight," added the monk, whose 
 experienced eyes had glanced to the golden spurs of his visitant ; 
 "come to my hermitage, there to partake of such refreshment 
 as I can bestow. When your repast is ended, I will, by confi- 
 dence on my part, merit yours." 
 
 This invitation was that of worldly courtesy, rather than the 
 rustic welcome of a recluse monk. The cavalier thanked him 
 cordially, adding, that he must first provide food and water for his 
 horse, and that afterwards he would gratefully accept his host's 
 invitation. The old man entered with the spirit of a soldier into

 Ill's £^uest's anxiety for his steed, and assisted in purveying to its 
 wants, ino-ratiatinij himself meanwhile with its master, bv dis- 
 covering and praising scientifically its points of beauty. The 
 poor animal showed tokens of over fatigue, yet still he did not 
 refuse his food, and the cavalier marked with joy that his eye 
 grew brighter and his knees firmer after feeding. 
 
 They then entered the cottage, and the soldier's eye was at- 
 tracted from more sacred emblems by a sword whichwas suspended 
 over a picture of the Virgin : — " You belong to our Chivalry !" 
 he exclaimed, while his countenance lighted up with joyful 
 recognition. 
 
 "i^ow I belong to the holy order whose badge I wear," the 
 monk replied, pointing to his Benedictine dress. " In former 
 days I followed a brave leader to the field, and, in his service, 
 incurred such guilt, as I now try to expiate by fasting and 
 prayer." 
 
 The monk's features were convulsed by agitation as he spoke, 
 then crossing his arms on his breast, he was absorbed in thought 
 for a few moments, after which he raised his head and resumed 
 the calm and even serene look that characterized him. '•' Sir 
 Knight," said he, motioning to the table novr spread for the 
 repast, *•'! have but poor fare to ofier, but a soldier will not 
 disdain its meagreness. My wine I may praise, as being the 
 produce of a generous vintage ; I have kept it sealed, to open it 
 on occasions like the present, and rejoice that your strength will 
 be recruited by it." 
 
 Bread, fruits, cheese, and a flagon of the wine, which merited 
 the giver's eulogium, composed the fugitive's breakfast, whose 
 fatigue required cordial and repose. As he was occupied by his 
 repast, his host eyed him with evident agitation, eager yet fearful 
 to question him on the subject of the battle. At length he again 
 asked, " You come from the field on which the forces of the 
 king and of the earl of Eichmond met ?" 
 
 "Ido." 
 
 " You fought for the White Eose, and you fly ?" 
 
 " I fought for the White Eose till it was struck to the ground. 
 The king has fallen with his chief nobility around him. Eew 
 Yorkists remain to mourn the success of the Lancastrians." 
 
 Deep grief clouded the old man's countenance, but accustomed 
 to subdue his feelings, as one on whom, being stricken by an 
 overwhelming misery, all subsequent disasters fall blunted, he 
 continued with greater calmness : *' Pardon me, noble gentle- 
 man, if I appear to ask an indiscreet question. You are of 
 lordly bearing, and probably filled a place near the royal person. 
 Did you hear, on the night before last, aught of the arrival of a 
 stranger youth at the king's tent?"

6 THE FLIGHT FBOM 
 
 The knight eyed the old man with a quick glance, asking, in 
 his turn, "Are you, then, the foster-father of Xing Richard's son ? " 
 
 "Did you see my boy?" cried the priest. "Did his father 
 acknowledge him ? — Where is he now ? — Did he enter the ranks 
 to fight and fall for his parent ?" 
 
 ** On the night of which you speak," said the stranger, evading 
 the immediate question, "the king placed his son's hand in 
 mine, as I vowed to protect and guard him if ill befell our party, 
 as it has befallen." 
 
 " Surely some presentiment of evil haunted the king's mind." 
 
 " I do believe it ; for his manner was solemn and affecting. 
 He bade the youth remember that he was a Plantagenet, and 
 spoke proudly of the lineage from which he sprung. The young 
 esquire listened intently, looking at his father with such an 
 ingenuous and thoughtful expression, that he won my heart to 
 love him." 
 
 " JN'ow bless thee, Sir Knight, whoever thou art, for this 
 praise of my poor Edmund. I pray you, hasten to tell me what 
 more passed." 
 
 The cavalier continued his account ; but his manner was 
 serious, as if the conclusion of his tale would afflict his auditor. 
 He related how, on quitting the royal tent, he had led Edmund 
 Plantagenet to his own, thereto converse with him awhile, the 
 better to learn whether his bearing and speech showed promise 
 of future merit. Xing Eichard had enjoined his son to return 
 to his seclusion early on the following morning ; but as soon as 
 he entered his conductor's tent, he knelt to him and asked a 
 boon, while tears gathered in his eyes, and his voice was broken 
 by the fervour of his desire. The noble was moved by his 
 entreaties, and promised to grant his request, if it did not militate 
 against his honour and allegiance. " It is for honour that I 
 speak," said Plantagenet ; "I am older in years than in seeming, 
 for already I number twenty summers ; and, spite of my boyish 
 look, I am familiar with martial exercises, and the glorious 
 promise of war. Let me draw my sword for my father to-mor- 
 row — let me, at your side, prove myself a worthy descendant of 
 the conquerors of France ! Who will fight for King Richard 
 with greater courage, fidelity, and devotion, than his acknowledged 
 and duteous son?" The cavalier yielded to his noble yearnings. 
 Clothed in armour he entered the ranks, and hovered a protec- 
 ting angel near his parent during the bloody contest. And now, 
 as his venerable guardian watched with trembling eagerness the 
 countenance of his guest while he told his tale, and the stranger, 
 with bitter regret, was about to relate that he had seen Plan- 
 tagenet felled to the ground by a battle-axe, quick steps, and 
 then a knocking, was heard at the cottage door. The stranger

 started on his feet, and put his hand upon his sword; but a 
 bright smile illuminated the monk's face, as the very youth of 
 whom they spoke, Edmund Plantagenet, rushed into the apart- 
 ment. His soiled garments and heated brow spoke of travel 
 and fatigue, while his countenance wore an expression of wildness 
 and even of horror. He started when he saw the stranger, but 
 quickly recognized him as his new friend. " Thank God !" he 
 cried, " that you, my dear lord, have not fallen into the hands of , 
 the sacrilegious usurper ! It is my father's spirit that has saved 
 you for his son's sake, that I may not be utterly abandoned and 
 an orphan." 
 
 With milder accost he bent his knee to his holy guardian, and 
 then turned to answer the cavalier's questions of how he had 
 escaped death from the blow he had received, and v, hat new 
 events had occured since he had quitted the field early on the 
 preceding day ? — while the monk chid him for his disobedience 
 to his father's commands, in having mingled with the fray. The 
 eyes of Plantagenet flashed fire at this reproach.— " Could I 
 know that my father's crown and life," he exclaimed impetuously, 
 *' depended on the combat, and not bring to his aid my weak 
 arm ? God of Heaven ! had there been five hundred true as I^, 
 we might all have fallen round him : but never, never, should 1 
 have seen the sight which last night I saw — nor heard the sounds 
 I last night heard !" 
 
 The youth covered his face with his hands, and the boiling 
 tears trickled between his fingers. " Tell me," cried the noble, 
 " what has happened ? — and swiftly tell me, for I loiter here too 
 long." 
 
 Almost suffocated by emotion, Plantagenet related, that when 
 he recovered from the trance into which the fearful blow he had 
 received had thrown him, the earl's camp-followers were busy 
 among the slain : and that he had seen the body of King 
 Eichard — of his father— thrown half-naked across a mule, thus 
 to be borne to be exposed to the pubhc gaze and mockery in 
 Leicester, where, but the day before, he had ridden with the 
 royal crown on his head, the acknowledged sovereign of England. 
 And that crown, base, ill-bartered bauble, having been found in 
 the tent by Lord Stanley, he had brought and placed on Eich- 
 mond's head, while the soldiers, with one acclaim, hailed him 
 Henry the Seventh, King of England. 
 
 The last words more than the others, for the death of his 
 royal master was already known to him, moved the knight : — 
 "Is this the end of our hopes?'' he cried. "Am I then too 
 late ? Farewell, my friends ! Plantagenet, I shall never forget 
 my oath to the king ; I shall become, I fear, an outcast and a 
 soldier of fortune, even if I escape worse fate j but claim when

 vou will, and it shall be yours, whatever protection I can alFord 
 you." 
 
 "Yield, then. Lord Lovel," said the youth, "to my first 
 request. You are in peril, let me share it ; permit me to accom- 
 pany you. If you refuse, my plan is alread}^ formed ; I repair 
 to the earl of Lincoln, whom King E-ichard named his successor, 
 and oiFer myself as a soldier in his attempt to discrown the 
 usurping Henry, and to raise again the White Eose to its right- 
 ful supremacy." 
 
 " To the earl of Lincohi — the successor of Eichard — to him 
 you would repair? It is well — come with me now, and I will 
 present you to that nobleman. If your foster-father consents, 
 bid adieu to this seclusion for a time, and accompany me to 
 Loudon, to new contests — to the combat of right against might 
 — to success and honour, or to defeat and death ! " 
 
 The sun had risen high when, having taken leave of the vene- 
 rable monk, who would not oppose his pupil's gallant spirit of 
 enterprise, Lord Lovel and young Plantagenet threaded the forest 
 paths, which, by a safer and a shorter route than the highway, 
 took them on their road to London. For a time they led their 
 horses with difficulty through the entangled thicket, when at 
 last reaching the open road, they mounted, and Lord Lovel, who 
 was desirous of estimating the abilities and disposition of his 
 companion, entered into conversation with him. They first con- 
 versed on the sad changes which were the work of the eventful 
 day of battle ; afterwards the cavalier led Edmund to speak of 
 himself, his early life, his acquirements, and his hopes. 
 
 When Plantagen.et was but ten years old his mother died, and 
 her last request to the father of her boy, founded on a deep 
 knowledge of the world, was, that her son might be educated far 
 from the court, nor be drawn from the occupations and happier 
 scenes of private life, to become a hanger-on of princes and 
 nobles. There was a man, a gentleman and a knight, who had 
 been a partizan of the AVhite Eose, and who had fought and bled 
 for it in various battles between the duke of York and Henry the 
 Sixth. In one of these, the misery of the times, and horrible 
 consecjuences of civil dissension, caused him unwittingly to lift 
 his armed hand against his twin brother, nor did he discover the 
 mistake till, with his dying voice, that brother called on him to 
 assist him against his slayer. A life of seclusion, penance, and 
 prayer, alone blunted his sense of remorse, and quitting the 
 world, he retired to a monastery, where after due noviciate ho 
 took vows, and then shrinking from commerce with his kind, 
 followed by visions that spoke for ever to him of his unnatural 
 crime, he retreated to the forest of Leicestershire, to dwell alono 
 with his grief and his repentance.

 His retreat was known to many of his friends, and cLanee 
 had brought the duke of Gloucester at one time to visit him ; 
 when the ancient warrior rejoiced with enthusiasm at the 
 exaltation of the party to which he was attached. The death 
 of the mother of Edmund had the effect of softening the duke's 
 heart, of makino^ for a short interval worldly cares and objects 
 distasteful to him, and of filling him with a desire of seclusion 
 and peace. If he was unable to enjoy these himself, he re- 
 solved that at least his child should not be drawn by him into 
 the thorny path of rivalship and ambition. His mother's last 
 injunction strengthened this feeling ; and the duke, visiting 
 a^ain the hermit of the wood, induced him to take charge of 
 Edmund, and bringing him up in ignorance of his real parentage, 
 to bestow such education on him as would enable him to fill 
 with reputation an honourable, if not a distinguished station in 
 society. This order of things was not changed by Richard's 
 exaltation to the crown. On the contrary, the dangers he 
 incurred from his usurpation made him yet more anxious to 
 secure a peaceful existence for his offspring. When, however, 
 his legitimate son, whom he had created prince of Wales, died, 
 paternal affection awoke strong in his heart, and he could not 
 resist his desire of seeing Edmund : a memorable visit for the 
 priest-bred nursling of the forest ! It gave him a link with 
 society, with which before he had felt no connexion : his imagi- 
 nation and curiosity were highly excited. His revered friend, 
 yielding to his eager demands, was easily enticed to recur to the 
 passed scenes of an eventful life. The commencement of the 
 wars of the two Eoses, and their dreadful results, furnished 
 inexhaustible topics of discourse. Plautagenet listened with 
 breathless interest, although it was not till the eve of the battle 
 of Bosworth, that he knew how indissolubly his own fortunes 
 were linked with those of the house of York. 
 
 The events of the few last days had given him a new exist- 
 ence. For the first time, feeling was the parent of action ; and 
 a foregoing event drove him on to the one subsequent. He was 
 excited to meditate on a thousand schemes, while the unknown 
 future inspired him with an awe that thrilled his young heart 
 with mingled pain and pleasure. He uttered his sentiments 
 with the ingenuousness of one who had never been accustomed 
 to converse with any but a friend ; and as he spoke, his dark 
 and thoughtful eyes beamed with a tempered fire, that showed 
 him capable of deep enthusiasm, though utter want of know- 
 ledge of the world must make him rather a follower than a 
 leader. 
 
 They rode on meanwhile, the noble cavalier and gentle squire 
 indulging in short repose. The intense fatigue Edmund at first

 endured, seemed to be subdued by tlie nec::.'ii-y of its. con- 
 tinuance, nor did it prevent liim from conversing with Lord 
 Lovel, He was anxious thoroughly to understand the imme- 
 diate grounds of the earl of Eichmond's invasion, and to 
 ascertain the relative position of the remaining chiefs of the 
 White Eose : " Where," he asked, " are Edward the Fourth's 
 children ? " 
 
 "The elder of these," Loj-d Lovel replied, "the Lady Eliza- 
 beth, is, by direction of her uncle, at Sheriff Hutton, in York- 
 shire." 
 
 _ " And where are the princes ? Edward, who was proclaimed 
 king, and his younger brother? " 
 
 _ " They were long imprisoned in the Tower. Young Edward 
 died there more than a year ago." 
 
 " And the Duke of York ? " 
 
 " He is supposed to have died also : they were both sickly 
 boys." 
 
 Lord Lovel said these words in a grave voice, and suspicion 
 would have been instilled into any but the unsuspecting Ed- 
 mund, of some covert meaning. After a short pause, he 
 continued : — the question of the succession stands thus. Your 
 father, the duke of Gloucester, threw the stigma of illegitimacy 
 on King Edward's children, and thus took from them their 
 right of inheriting the crown. The attainder of the duke 
 of Clarence was considered reason sufficient why his children 
 should be excluded from the throne, and their uncle, in con- 
 sequence, became, by right of birth, king of England : his 
 son he created prince of Wales. We submitted ; for a child 
 like Edward the Fifth could scarcely be supported against an 
 experienced warrior, a man of talent, a sage and just king, but 
 at the expense of much blood. The wounds intiicted by the 
 opposing houses of York and Lancaster were yet, as the late 
 successful rebellion proves, unhealed ; and had the Yorkists 
 contended among themselves, they would yet sooner have lost 
 the supremacy they so hardly acquired: Eichard therefore 
 receiv'ed our oaths of allegiance. When his son died, the 
 question of who was the heir to the crown became agitated ; 
 and the king at first declared the earl of Warwick, the son 
 of the duke of Clarence, to be his successor. It was a dan- 
 gerous step — and the imprudent friends of the young earl 
 made it more so — to name him to succeed, who, if he were 
 permitted at any time to wear the crown, might claim prece- 
 dence of him who possessed it. Poor Warwick paid the 
 penalty of youth and presumption : he is now a prisoner at 
 Sheriff Hutton ; and John de la Poole, carl of Lincoln, son of 
 Eichard's sister, and by the removal of the children of his

 elder brothers, liis heir by law was nominated to succeed his 
 uncJe. I am now proceeding to him. I am ignorant of the 
 conduct he will pursue ; whether he will make head against 
 
 this Lancastrian king, or . Lincoln is a noble cavalier; 
 
 a man whom bright honour clothes ; he is brave, generous, and 
 good. I shall guide myself by his counsels and resolves ; and 
 you, it appears, will follow my example." 
 
 ^ After a pause, Lord Lovel continued : " After the death or 
 disappearance of his princely nephews, the king, wishing to 
 confirm his title, was ready to take the stigma thrown on their 
 'birth from his brother's daughters, and to marry his niece, the 
 Lady Elizabeth. Her mother at first resisted, but the prospect 
 of seeing her children restored to their rights, and herself to her 
 lost dignity, overcame her objections, and the princess yielded a 
 wilHng consent. Meanwhile, the Yorkists, who joined the earl of 
 Richmond, extorted from him a vow that he would make King 
 Edward's daughter his queen ; and even the Lancastrians, 
 thinking thus to secure a king of their own, are eager for this 
 union : yet the earl hates us all so cordially that he was hardly 
 brought to consent. Should he, now that he has declared 
 himself king, evade his promise, the children of Ehzabeth 
 Woodville will suffer the stain of illegitimacy ; but if the 
 marriage has place, and this unhappy race is restored to their 
 honours and rights, our self-named sovereign may find that his 
 own hands have dug the pit into which he will fall." 
 
 A long silence succeeded to these explanations. The last 
 expression used by Lovel inspired Edmund with wonder and 
 curiosity ; but the noble pressing his horse to a swifter pace, 
 did not hear his observations, or hearing them, replied only by 
 saying, " Three hours' good riding will bring us to London. 
 Courage, Plantagenet ! slacken not your speed, my good boy ; 
 soft ease will follow this hard labour." 
 
 The young moon in its first quarter was near its setting when 
 they arrived at London. They approached from Edgware : 
 without entering the town, they skirted its northern extremity, 
 till Lord Lovel, cheeking his horse, remarked to his companion, 
 that he judged it fitting to delay approaching the residence of 
 the earl of Lincoln, until the setting of the moon and subsequent 
 darkness secured them from observation.

 THE CONFEEENCE. 
 
 Yes, my good Lord, 
 It doth contain a king : King Richard lies 
 Witiiin the limits of yon lime and stone. 
 
 SlIAKSFEARE. 
 
 The enrl of Lincoln, declared byHicliard tlie Third, lieir to the 
 crown, did not join the royal forces, nor appear at the battle of 
 Bosworth. This distinguished prince was a man of singular 
 abihties and strength of mind, which chivalrous generosity 
 adorned with a lustre superior even to that which he derived 
 from his high rank. Lord Lovel was possessed of knightly 
 courage, untarnished honour, and gentlemanly accomplishment. 
 To these military and graceful qualities Lincoln added the wis- 
 dom of a statesman and the moral energy resulting from inflexi- 
 ble principle. He felt himself responsible to mankind and 
 to all posterity for his actions. He was brave — that v>'as a vir- 
 tue of the times ; but he was just, in a comprehensive sense of 
 the word, and that exalted him above them. His manly features 
 did not so much wear the stamp of beauty, though, like all the 
 offspring of the House of York, he was handsome, as of the best 
 quality of man, a perception of right, and resolution to achieve 
 that right. 
 
 Lord Lincoln disapproved decidedly of the usurpation of his 
 uncle, Hichard the Third, over the children of Edward the 
 Fourth. He allowed that the evidence was strong in favour of 
 that king's former marriage, and their consequent illegitimacy ; 
 but he said, that Elizabeth Woodville had so long been held 
 queen of England, and her children heirs to the crown, that it 
 was impossible to eradicate the belief of the English people, that 
 their allegiance was due to him who had been proclaimed even 
 by his uncle, Edward the Fifth. Even if they were put aside, 
 the attainder passed against the duke of Clarence was an insuffi- 
 cient reason to deprive his son of his lawful inheritance. He 
 saw England wasted, and her nobility extirpated by civil con- 
 test; and he perceived the seeds of future strife in the assump- 
 tion of the crown by the duke of Gloucester. When the son of 
 Hichard the Third died, and the earl of Warwick was named 
 his successor, the superior right of the nephew before the reign- 
 ing uncle became so eminent a subject of discussion, that the 
 king was obliged to recall his declaration, and to confine the

 young prince in a castle in Yorkshire. The earl of Liacoln, 
 then seven and twenty years of age, was next named. He re- 
 monstrated vrith his uncle privately ; but fear of dividing the 
 House of York against itself, and a disdain to make common 
 cause with the dowager queen's relations, made him outwardly 
 submit; but his plan was formed, and secretly all his efforts 
 tended towards the restoring the children of Edward to their 
 paternal rights. 
 
 The boys were sickly. Edward the Fifth, irritated by the 
 extinction of the hopes which the intrigues of his mother had 
 kept alive in his breast, wasted by imprisonment in the Tower, 
 and brooking with untamed pride the change from a regal to a 
 private station, pined and died. Hichard, duke of York, was 
 between ten and eleven ; a sprightly, ingenuous boy, whose lively 
 spirit wore out his frame, and this, added to confinement and 
 attention to his dying brother, brought him also near the grave. 
 It was on the death of Edward, that the earl of Lincoln visited 
 the Tower, and saw young Eichard. The accounts given by the 
 attendants of his more than a child's devotion to his brother, his 
 replies full of sportive fancy, his beauty, though his cheek was 
 faded and his person grown thin, moved the generous noble to 
 deep compassion. He ventured, under the strong influence of 
 this feeling, to remonstrate warmly with his royal uncle, re*- 
 preaching him with needless cruelty, and telhng him how in 
 fact, though not in appearance, he was the murderer of his 
 nephews, and would be so held by all mankind. Kichard's ambi- 
 tion was satisfied by the success of his measures to obtain the 
 crown; but his fears were awake. The duke of Buckingham 
 was in arms against him — the queen and her surviving relatives 
 were perpetually employed in exciting discontents in the kingdom. 
 !Richard feared that if they obtained the person of his nephew, 
 he would be turned into an engine for his overthrow ; while to 
 obtain possession of him was the constant aim of their endea- 
 vours. He earnestly desired to reconcile himself to the queen, 
 and to draw her from the sanctuary in which she had immured 
 herself — she refused all his offers, unless her son was first placed 
 in her hand?. 
 
 His head, ripe with state plots, now conceived a scheme. He 
 consented that Lincoln should take the duke of York under his 
 charge, if he would first engage to keep his removal from the 
 Tower, and even his existence, a secret from his enemies. 
 Lincoln made the required promise ; the young prince was 
 conveyed to a country seat belonging to the earl, and Eichard, 
 in furtherance of his plan, caused a rumour to go abroad that he 
 also was dead. No one knew with whom this report originated. 
 AYhen, to assure themselves, various nobles visited the Tower,

14 THE CONFERENCE. 
 
 tlie boy was no longer tliere. The queen gave credit to the 
 tale. At this moment, Richard set on foot a negotiation of 
 marriaG:e with the eldest daughter of Edward the Fourth, the 
 Lady Elizabeth. The partizans of the earl of E-ichmond sought 
 to ensure the success of his enterprise by the same means : and 
 while little Eichard grew in health and happiness in his country 
 retreat, his own nearest and most attached relatives were giving 
 away his inheritance — his uncle unwittingly laid the foundation 
 stone of the reputation of cruelty and murder ever after 
 affixed to him ; and his mother, endeavouring to exalt her 
 daughter, and to restore herself to her lost station in the 
 kingdom, sealed the fatal decree that first deprived her son of 
 his rights, and afterwards of his life. 
 
 On the evening that Lord Lovel and Edmund Plantagcnet 
 entered London, the earl of Lincoln remained waitmg intelli- 
 gence from the field, in a palace he inhabited not far from 
 Tottenham Court, a secluded habitation, surrounded by a 
 garden and a high wall. This was an irksome situation for a 
 warrior ; but though his uncle loved, he distrusted him : his 
 projected marriage with the Lady Elizabeth would probably 
 cause him again to be father of an heir to the crown, and 
 knowing that Lincoln possessed, in the young duke of York, a 
 dangerous rival, he refused to allow him to take up arms 
 against Richmond. Lord Lincoln was alone, pacing his large 
 and vaulted hall in deep and anxious meditation. He, who with 
 conscience for his rule, takes, or endeavours to take, the reins 
 of fate into his own hands, must experience frequent misgivings ; 
 and often feel that he wheels near the edge of a giddy pre- 
 cipice, down which the tameless steeds he strives to govern 
 may, in an instant, hurl him and all dependent upon his 
 guidance. The simple feeling of compassion, arising from the 
 seeing childhood lose its buoyancy in undue confinement, had 
 first led the princely noble to take charge of his young cousin. 
 Afterwards, when he beheld the boy grow in health and yeava, 
 developing the while extraordinary quickness of intellect, and a 
 sweet, ingenuous disposition, he began to reflect on the station 
 he held, his rights and his injuries ; and then the design was 
 originated on which he was now called to act. 
 
 If llichard gained the day, all would stand as before. Should 
 he be defeated — and that second sense, that feeling of coming 
 events, which is one of the commonest, though the least acknow- 
 ledged of the secret laws of our nature, whispered the yet 
 unrevealed truth to him — who then would assume England's 
 diadem, and how" could he secure it for its rightful owner, the 
 only surviving son of Edward the Fourth? All these reflections 
 coursed themselves through his brain, while, with the zeal pf a

THE CONFEEENCE. 15 
 
 partizan, and the fervour of one vredded to the justice of his 
 cause, he revolred every probable change of time and fortune. 
 
 At this moment a courier vras announced : he brought tidings 
 from the field. As is usual on the eve of a great event, tliej vrere 
 dubious and contradictory. The armies faced each other, and 
 the battle was impending. The doubts entertained on both 
 sides, as to the part that Lord Stanley would take, gave still a 
 greater uncertainty to the anticipations of each. 
 
 Soon after the arrival of this man, the loud ringing at the 
 outer gate was renewed; and the trampling of horses, as they 
 entered the court, announced a more numerous company. 
 There was something in the movements of his domestics that 
 intimated to the earl that his visitor was of superior rank. 
 Could it be the king, who had fled ; conquered, and a fugitive ? 
 Could such terms be applied to the high-hearted Richard? The 
 doors of the hall were thrown open, and the question answered 
 by the entrance of his visitant : it was a woman ; and her name, 
 " Lady Brampton ! " in a tone of wonder, burst from the noble's 
 lips. 
 
 " Even I, my good lord," said the lady ; " allow me your 
 private ear; I bring intelligence from Leicestershire. All is 
 lost," she continued, when the closing of the door assured her 
 of privacy; "all is lost, and all is gained — Richard is slain. 
 My emissaries brought swift intelligence of this event to me at 
 Northampton, and I have hastened with it hither, that without 
 loss of time you may act." 
 
 There was a quickness and a decision in the lady's manner, 
 that checked rather than encouraged her auditor. She con- 
 tinued: " Yesper hour has long passed — it matters not — • 
 London yet is ours. Command instantly that Richard the 
 Fourth be proclaimed king of England." 
 
 Lord Lincoln started at these words. The death of his uncle 
 and benefactor could not be received by him like tlie loss of a 
 move at chess ; a piece lost, that required the bringing up of 
 other pieces to support a weak place. " The king is slain," 
 were words that rang in his ears : drowning every otlier that 
 the lady uttered with rapidity and agitation. " We will speak 
 of that anon," he replied; and going to the high window of 
 his hall, he threw it open, as if the air oppressed him. The 
 wind sighed in melancholy murmurs among the branches of 
 the elms and limes in the garden : the stars were bright, and the 
 setting moon was leaving the earth to their dim illumination. 
 "Yesternight," thought Lincoln, "he was among us, a part of 
 our conversation, our acts, our lives ; now his glazed eyes 
 behold not these stars. The past is his : with the present and 
 the future he has no participation."

16 THE CONFEEENCE. 
 
 Lady Erampton's impatience did not permit tlie earl lon<T to 
 indulge in that commune with nature, which we eagerly seek 
 when grief and death throws us back on the weakness of our 
 human state, and we feel that we ourselves, our best laid pro- 
 jects and loftiest hopes, are but the playthings of destiny. 
 " Wherefore," cried the lady, *' does De la Poole linger ? Does 
 he hesitate to do his cousin justice P Does he desire to follow 
 in the steps of his usurping predecessor? Wherefore this 
 delay?" 
 
 " To strike the surer," replied Lincoln. " May not .1 ask, 
 wherefore this impatience?" 
 
 Even as he spoke, steps were heard near the apartment; and 
 while the eyes of both were turned with inquietude on the 
 expected intruder, Lord Lovel entered : there was no triumph, 
 no eager anticipation on his brow — he was latfguid from ill 
 success and fatigue. Lincoln met him with the pleasure of one 
 who sees his friend escaped from certain death. He was over- 
 joyed to be assured of his existence ; he was glad to have his 
 assistance on the present emergency. " We know," he said, 
 " all the evil tidings you bring us ; we are now deliberating on 
 the conduct we are to pursue : your presence will facilitate our 
 measures. Tell me what other friends survive to aid us. The 
 duke of Norfolk, the Staffords, Sir Hobert Brakenbury, where 
 are they ? " 
 
 Lovel had seen the duke fall, the Staffords had accompanied 
 his flight ; uncertainty still hung over the fate of many others. 
 This detail of the death of many of their common friends, 
 subdued the impetuosity of the lady, till an account of how 
 ."Richard himself had fought and been slain recalled her to their 
 former topic of discussion ; and, again, she said, " It is strange 
 that you do not perceive the dangers of delay. Why is not the 
 king proclaimed ? " 
 
 *' Do you not know," asked Lord Lovel, " that the king is 
 proclaimed ? " 
 
 Lady Brampton clasped her hands, exclaiming, " Then Richard 
 the Fourth will wear his father's crown ! " 
 
 " Henry the Seventh," said Lovel, " possesses and wears the 
 English crown. Lord Stanley placed the diadem on the head 
 of the earl of E-ichmond, and his soldiers, with one acclaim, 
 acknowledged him as their sovereign." 
 
 " This is mere trifling," said the lady ; " the base-born off- 
 spring of Lancaster ma'y dare aspire so high, but one act of ours 
 dethrones him. The Yorkists are numerous, and will defend 
 their king : London is yet ours." 
 
 "Yes," replied Lincoln, '* it is in our power to deluge the 
 streets of London with bloody, to bring massacre among its

 citizens, and worse disaster on its wives and maidens. I would 
 not buy an eternal crown for myself— I will not strive to place 
 that of England on my kinsman's liead— at this cost. We have 
 had over-much of war : I have seen too many of the noble, 
 young, and gallant, fall by the sword. Brute force has had its 
 day ; now let us try what policy can do." 
 
 The council these friends held together was long and anxious. 
 The lady still insisted on sudden and resolute measures. Lord 
 Lovel, a soldier in all his nature, looked forward to the callino- 
 together the Yorkists from every part of the kingdom. The 
 'earl, with a statesman's experience, saw more of obstacle to their 
 purpose in the elevation of Henry the Seventh than either of 
 his companions would allow ; the extreme youth of the duke of 
 York, the oblivion into which he had sunk, and the stain on his 
 bn-th, which was yet unremoved, would disincline the people to 
 hazard life and fortune in his cause. Henry had taken oath to 
 marry his sister, the Lady Elizabeth, and when thus the progeny 
 of Edward the Fourth were freed from the slur under wTiich 
 they now laboured, the whole country would be alive to the 
 claims of his only son. It was necessary now to place him in 
 safety, and far away from the suspicious eyes of his usurping 
 enemy. That morning Lord Lincoln had brought him up from 
 his rural retreat to the metropolis, and sheltered him for a few 
 hours under safe but strange guardianship. He was left at the 
 house of a Flemish money-lender well known at court. It was 
 agreed that Lord Lovel should take him thence, and make him 
 the companion of his journey to Colchester, where they should 
 remain watching the turn of events, and secretly preparing the 
 insurrection which would place him on the throne. Lady 
 Brampton was obliged to proceed immediately northwards to 
 join her husband ; the north was entirely Yorkist, and her 
 influence would materially assist the cause. The earl remained 
 in London ; he would sound the inclinations of the nobilitv, and 
 even coming in contact with the new king, watch over danger 
 and power at its fountain-head. One more question was dis- 
 cussed: Whether the queen, Elizabeth Woodville, sliould bo 
 made acquainted with the existence of her son. All three, from 
 various reasons, decided in the negative. A personal enmity 
 existed between the widow of Edward the Fourth and Ladv 
 Brampton : her party was detested by the two nobles. It woufd 
 be more popular with the nation, they thought, if her kinsmen, 
 whose upstart pretensions were the object of the derision and • 
 scorn of the old aristocracy, had no part in bestowing the crown 
 on the heir of the House of York. Time wore away durino- 
 these deliberations ; it was past midnight before the fi-iends

 separated. Lord Lovel presented Lis youn^ friend, Edmund 
 Planta,2;euct, to the earl, and recommended him to his protec- 
 tion. Refreshment was also necessary after LoYel's fatiguing 
 journey ; but he was so intent on accomplishing his purpose, 
 that he wasted but a few minutes in this manner, and then being 
 provided with a fresh horse from Lincoln's stables, he left the 
 palace to proceed first to the prsent abode of Richard of York, 
 and afterwards, accompanied by him, on his road to Essex. 
 
 Lord Lovel threaded his way through the dark narrow streets 
 of London towards Lothbury. The habitation of the money- 
 lender was well known to him, but it was not easily entered at 
 past midnight. A promised bribe to the apprentice who hailed 
 him from the lofty garret-window, and his signet-ring sent in to 
 his master, at length procured admission into the bedchamber of 
 Mynheer Jahn Warbeck. The old man sat up in his bed, his 
 red cotton night-cap on his head, his spectacles, with which he 
 had examined the ring, on his nose ; his chamber was narrow 
 and dilapidated, his bed of ill condition. " Who would suppose," 
 thought Lovel, " that this man holds half England in pawn ?" 
 
 When Warbeck heard that the errand of Lovel was to take 
 from him his princely charge, he rose hastily, wrapping a robe 
 round him, and opened a small wainscoat door leading into a 
 little low room, whence he drew the half-sleeping and wondering 
 boy. There was a rush taper in therooi^i, and daylight began to 
 peep through the crevices of the shutters, giving melancholy 
 distinctness to the dirty and disrdantled chamber. One ray fell 
 directly on the red night-cap and spectacles of old Jahn, whose 
 parchment face was filled with wrinkles, yet they were lines of care, 
 not of evil, and there was even benevolence in his close mouth ; 
 for the good humour and vivacity of the boy had won on him. 
 Besides, he had himself a son, for whom he destined all his 
 wealth, of the same age as the little fellow whose plump roseate 
 hand he held in hjs own brown shrivelled palm. The boy came 
 in, rubbing his large blue eyes, the disordered ringlets of his 
 fair hair shading a face replete with vivacity and intelligence. 
 Mynheer Jahn was somewhat loth to part with the little prince, 
 but the latter clapped his hands in ecstacy when he heard that 
 Lord Lovel had come to take him away. 
 
 " I pray you tell me. Sir Knight," said old Warbeck, " whether 
 intelligence hath arrived of the victory of our gracious sovereign, 
 and the defeat of the Welch rebels." 
 
 Richard became grave at these words ; he fixed his, eyes 
 inquiringly on the noble : " Dear Lord Lovel," he cried, " for I 
 remember you well, my very good lord, when you came to the 
 Tower and found me and Robert Clifibrd playing at bowls — tell 
 me, how you have fought, and whether you have won."

 ** Mine are evil tidings," said Lord Lovel ; " all is lost. "We 
 were vaDquished, and 3'oiir royal uncle slain." 
 
 Warbeck's countenance changed at these words ; he lamented 
 the king; he lamented the defeat of the party which he had 
 aided by various advances of money, and his regrets at once 
 -sxpressed sorrow for the death of some, and dread from the con- 
 fiscation of the property of others. Meanwhile, Eichard of York 
 was full of some thought that swelled his little breast ; taking 
 Lovel's hand, he asked again, " My uncle, Eichard the Third, is 
 dead?" 
 
 "Even so," was the reply; "he died nobly on the field of 
 battle." 
 
 The child drew himself up, and his eyes flashed as he said 
 proudly, — " Then I am king of England." 
 
 " Who taught your grace that lesson ?" asked Lovel. 
 
 "[My liege — my brother Edward. Often and often in the long 
 winter nights, and when he was sick in bed, he told me how, 
 after he Lad been proclaimed king, he had been dethroned ; but 
 that when our uncle died he should be king again ; and that if 
 it pleased God to remove him, I should stand in his place; and I 
 should restore my mother's honour, and this he made me swear." 
 
 "Bless the boy!" cried Warbeck, "he speaks most sagely; 
 may the saints incline my lord, the earl of Lincoln, to do his 
 royal cousin justice !" 
 
 "Your grace," said Lovel, "'shall hear more of this as we pro- 
 ceed on our journey. Mynheer Jahn, the earl bade me apply 
 to you ; you are to repair to him before noon ; meanwhile, fill 
 this long empty purse with gold coins. He will be my guarantee." 
 
 "Lend me the money," cried the little duke, "I will repay 
 you. "We will repay you, when we have our crown." 
 
 This was an inducement not to be resisted. AYarberk counted 
 out the gold ; the boy with light steps tripped down the creaking 
 old staircase, and when Lovel had mounted, taking his hand, he 
 sprung in the saddle before him. The fresh morning air was 
 grateful to both, after the close chambers of the Fleming. The 
 noble put his horse to a quick trot, and leaving London by a 
 different road from that by which he had entered, took his way 
 through Eomford and Chelmsford to Colchester. 
 
 The news of the earl of Eichmond's victory and assumption 
 of the crown reached London that night. The citizens heard it 
 on their awakening. The market people from the west related 
 it to those who came in from the east ; but it had not hitherto 
 travelled in that direction. Lovel knew that the storm was 
 behind him, but he outrode it ; on the evening of the second day 
 he was safe in sanctuary at Colchester. His young charge was 
 lodged at a farm-house belonging to a tenant of Sir Humphrey

 CHAPTEE III. 
 
 ELIZABETH OF YORK. 
 
 Small joy have I iii being England's queen. 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 Henry the Seventh was a man of strong sense and sound under- 
 standing. He was prudent, resolute, and valiant ; on the other 
 hand, he was totally devoid of generosity, and was actuated all 
 his life by base and bad passions. At first the ruling feeling of 
 his heart was hatred of the House of York — nor did he wholly 
 give himself up to the avarice that blotted his latter years, till 
 the extinction of that unhappy family satisfied his revenge, so 
 that for want of fuel the flame died away. Most of his relatives 
 and friends had perished in the field or on the scaffold by the 
 hands of the Yorkists — his own existence had been in jeopardy 
 during their exaltation ; and the continuance of his reign, and 
 even of his life, depended on their utter overthrow. Henry had 
 a mind commensurate to the execution of his plans : he had a 
 talent for seizing, as if instinctively, on all the bearings of a 
 question before him ; and a ready perception of the means by 
 which he might obviate difficulties and multiply facilities, was 
 the most prominent part of his character. He never aimed at 
 too much, and felt instantaneously when he had arrived at the 
 enough. More of cruelty would have roused England against 
 him ; less would have given greater hopes to the partizans of his 
 secreted rival. He had that exact portion of callousness of heart 
 which enabled him to extricate himself in the admirable manner 
 he did from all his embarrassments. 
 
 It is impossible to say what his exact views were, when 
 he landed in England, an I made head against Richard the Third. 
 His right of succession, even through the House of Lancaster, 
 was ill-founded, and probably he would scarcely have dared to 
 decorate his brows with the royal circlet but for the happy bold- 
 ness of Stanley, and the enthusiasm felt by his soldiers in the 
 hour of victory, which had bestowed it on him. Once a king, as

 it was impossible, without risk of life, to sink to a private station, 
 he did not hesitate, but bent every energy of his mind to the 
 contriving the means to seat himself firmly on his newlj-acquired 
 throne. 
 
 The illegitimacy of Edward the Fourth's children had removed 
 them from the succession. But though no doubt was entertained 
 as to the fact of Edward having married Lady Eleanor Butler, 
 yet Henry had the taint of illegitimacy on his own race ; and, 
 moreover, Elizabeth Woodville having so long filled the station 
 of queen of England, the public voice went in her favour, and 
 the majority of the English people looked upon the tale which 
 deprived her children of their rights, as a contrivance of their 
 usurping uncle. What then was to become of them ? Edward 
 the Fifth was dead : of this fact there was no doubt. It had 
 been rumoured that the duke of York had not long survived his 
 brother. To ascertain the truth of this report, Henry dispatched 
 one of his most staunch adherents to the Tower. The boy was 
 not there ; but a mystery hung over his fate which did not quite 
 assure the new king of his death. Henry feared that he was in 
 the hands of the Yorkists, and this dread gave fresh vigour to 
 his distrust and abhorrence of the partizans of the White Eose. 
 He formed a scheme to defeat their projects ; he caused it to be 
 disseminated that both the princes had been found dead- 
 murdered — in the Tower. 
 
 The competitors for the crown, whose claims ranked next, 
 were the daughters of Edward the Fourth. Henry immediately 
 saw the necessity of agreeing to the treaty entered into by the 
 countess of Richmond, for his marriage with the eldest of these 
 princesses. He hated to owe his title to the crown to any part 
 of the House of York ; he resolved, if possible, to delay and 
 break the marriage ; but his own friends were urgent with him 
 to comply, and prudence dictated the measure ; he therefore 
 promised to adopt it — thus eflfectually to silence the murmurs of 
 the party of the White Eose. 
 
 But if the young duke of York reappeared meanwhile, it 
 would be necessary not to repeal the Act of Parliament that cast 
 a stigma on his birth. If the children of Elizabeth Woodville 
 and Edward the Fourth were debarred from the crown, the earl 
 of Warwick was the next heir. He was confined, by Eichard 
 the Third, at Sheriff Hutton, in Yorkshire. He was the especial 
 object of Henry's fear, and now he commanded him to be 
 brought from his northern prison to the Tower of London, to be 
 kept a close prisoner in that melancholy and ill-fated place. 
 There was one other rival, the earl of Lincoln, named by Eichard 
 to succeed him; but his pretensions came so far behind the 
 others, and he enjoyed so high a reputation for sagacity and

 virtue, tliat Henry believed it best to let him alone for the pre- 
 sent, only surrounding him with spies ; and resolved, on the tirst 
 note of danger, to destroy him. 
 
 Fortune smiled on the new sovereign. The disappearance of 
 the two children from the Tower caused the Yorkists to settle 
 their affections on the young Elizabeth. She was at SheriiF 
 Hutton, waiting impatiently for her union with her uncle ; now 
 she received commands to proceed to London, as the affianced 
 bride of that uncle's conqueror. Already the common talk ran 
 on the entwining of the two Eoses ; and all the adherents of her 
 family, who could gain access, recommended their cause to her, 
 and entreated her, in the first days of power, not to forget her 
 father's friends, but to incline the heart of her husband to an 
 impartial love for the long rival houses of Lancaster and York. 
 
 Two parties arrived on the same day at SheriflP Hutton, on the 
 different missions of conducting the Lady Elizabeth and the earl 
 of Warwick to London. On the morning of their departure th^y 
 met in the garden of their abode to take leave of each other. 
 Elizabeth was nineteen years old, "Warwick was the exact age 
 of her brother, Edward the Fifth ; he was now sixteen. 
 
 " We are about to travel the same road with far difi'erent 
 expectations," said Warwick. *' I go to be a prisoner ; you, fair 
 cousin, to ascend a throne." 
 
 There was a despondency in the youth's manner that deeply 
 affccced this princess. " Dear Edward," she replied, clasping his 
 hand; " we have been fellow-prisoners long, and sympathy has 
 lightened the burthen of our chains. Can I forget our walks in 
 this beauteous park, and the love and confidence we have felt for 
 each other? My dearest boy, when I am queen, Esther will 
 claim a boon from Ahasuerus, and Warwick shall be the chief 
 noble in my train.'' 
 
 She looked at him with a brilliant smile ; her heart glowed 
 with sisterly afi'ection. She might well entertain high anticipa- 
 tions of future power ; she was in the pride of youth and beauty ; 
 the light spirit of expected triumph lighted up her lovely face. 
 She was about to become the bride of a conqueror, yet one 
 whose laurels would droop without her propping ; she was to be 
 queen of her native land, the pearly clasp to unite the silken 
 bond with which peace now bound long discordant EnglancJ. 
 She was unable to communicate this spirit of hope to her 
 desponding friend ; he gazed on her beauty with admiration and 
 deep grief, asking, with tearful eyes, " Shall we ever meet 
 again ? " 
 
 " Yes ! in London, in the court of Henry, we shall again bo 
 companions — friends." 
 
 **I go to tho Tower, not to the court/' replied Warwick,

ELIZABETH OP YOEB:. 23 
 
 " and when those gloomy gates close on me, I shall pray that ray 
 head may soon repose on the cold stone that pillows my cousin 
 Edward. I shall sleep uneasily till then." 
 
 " Fie, cousin ! " said Elizabeth ; " such thoughts ill beseem 
 the nearest kinsman of the future queen of England. You \\ill 
 remain but a short time in the Tower ; but if you nurse thoughts 
 like these, you will pine there as you did before I shared your 
 prison here, and the roses with which my care has painted your 
 cheeks, will again fade." 
 
 "Wan and colourless will my cheek be ere your bright eyes 
 look on it again. Is it not sufficient grief that I part from you, 
 beloved friend !" 
 
 A gush at once of sorrow, of affection, of long suppressed love, 
 overpowered the youth. "I shall think of you," he added, " in 
 my prison-house ; and while I know that you regret my fate, I 
 cannot be wholly a wretch. Do you not love me ? And will 
 you not, as a proof, give me one of these golden hairs, to soothe 
 poor Warwick's misery? One only," he said, taking from_ her 
 braided locks the small gift he demanded, " I will not diminish 
 the rich beauty of your tresses, yet they will not look lovelier, 
 pressed by the jewelled diadem of England, than under the 
 green chaplet I crowned you with a few months past, my Queen 
 of May!" 
 
 And thus, the eyes of each glistening with tears, they parted. 
 For a moment Warwick looked as if he wished to press his 
 cousin to his heart ; and she, who loved him as a sister, would 
 have yielded to his embrace : but before his arms enfolded her, 
 he started back, bent one knee, pressed her hand to his lips, his 
 eyes, his brow, and bending his head for an instant towards the 
 ground, sprang up, and rushed down the avenue towards the 
 gate at which his guard awaited him. Elizabeth stood motion- 
 less, watching him till out of sight. The sun sparkled brightly 
 on a tuft of wild flowers at her feet. The glittering light caught 
 her eye. " It is noon," she thought ; " the morning dew is dry ; 
 it is Warwick's tears that gem these leaves." She gathered the 
 flowers, and, first kissing them, placed them in her bosom ; with 
 slow steps, and a sorrowing heart, she re-entered the castle. 
 
 The progress of the Lady Elizabeth from Sheriff Hutton to 
 London was attended by every circumstance that could sustain 
 her hopes. She was received with acclamation and enthusiasm 
 in every town through which she passed. She indeed looked 
 forward with girlish vanity to the prospect of sharing the throne 
 with Henry. She had long been taught the royal lesson, that 
 with princes, the inclinations are not to bear any part in a dis- 
 posal of the hand. Her imagination fed on the good she would 
 do for others, when raised to the regal dignity ; the hope of

 libcratlnf:^ Warwict, and of fulfilliDgj her mother's wishes in con- 
 ferriuo^ benefits on various partizaus of the "White Eosc, filled 
 her bosom with the purest joy ; youth, beauty, and the expecta- 
 tion of happiness, caused the measure of her content to overflow. 
 "With a fluttering heart she entered London : small preparation 
 liad been made to receive her, and she was immediately con- 
 ducted to her mother's abode at the Tower Eoyal, in the parish 
 of AYalbrook. The first check her hopes received arose from the 
 clouded brow of the queen, as she embraced her daughter, and 
 welcomed her arrival. Many fears in truth occupied the thoughts 
 of the illustrious v\idow. She could not forget her sons ; and 
 the mystery that hung over the fate of the younger pressed 
 heavily upon her. It was now the eighteenth of October, and 
 the preparations for the coronation of Henry were in great for- 
 wardness ; Parliament had recognized his title without any 
 allusion to the union with the heiress of the House of York. 
 She had endeavoured to fathom his purposes, and to understand 
 his character. She knew that he entertained a settled hatred 
 for the White E-osc, and that his chief pride lay in establishing 
 himself on the throne, independent of the claim he might acquire 
 by his marriage with the Lady Elizabeth. The common people 
 murmured, the Yorkists were discontented, — the neighbour 
 stage before they should break out into open rebellion. Thus 
 dark clouds interposed before the sun of peace, which had been 
 said to have risen on the event of the battle of Bosworth Field. 
 
 Henry the Seventh was crowned on the thirtieth of October. 
 The queen looked on this ceremony as the downfall of her hopes. 
 Housed by this fear, she entered into a sea of intrigue, in which, 
 after all, she had no certain aim, except that of re-animating tlie 
 zeal of the Yorkists, and of exciting such discontent in the public 
 mind, on the postponement of her daughter's marriage, as to 
 force Henry to consent to an immediate union. The gentle 
 Elizabeth had meanwhile submitted patiently to her destiny. 
 She dismissed regality from her thoughts, and devoted herself to 
 her mother ; recreating herself in the society of licr sisters, and 
 now and then contemplating the faded leaves she had brought 
 from Sheriff Hutton, and lamenting the fate of Warwick. She 
 had learned to fear and almost to hate Henry ; and, but for the 
 sake of her suffering party, to rejoice that he had apparently 
 relinquished his intention of marrying her. 
 
 The dissatisfaction manifested by the English people forced 
 Henry to comply with the universal wish entertained of seeing 
 the daughter of Edward the Fourth on the throne ; yet it was 
 not until the beginning of January that the princess received 
 intimation to prepare for her nuptials. This prospect, which had 
 before elated, now visited her coldly j for, without the hope of

 influencing her husband, the state of a queen appeared mere 
 bondage. In her heart she wished to reject her uncourteous 
 bridegroom ; and once she had ventured to express tliis desire 
 to her mother, who, filled with affright, laid aside her intrigues, 
 devoting herself to cultivate a more rational disposition in her 
 daughter. Henry paid the doomed girl one visit, and saw little 
 in her except a bashful child ; while his keener observation was 
 directed towards the dowager queen. She, with smooth brow 
 and winning smiles, did the honours of reception to her future 
 son-in-law — to her bitter foe. The cold courtesy of Henry 
 chilled her ; and a strong desire lurked under her glossy mien, 
 to reproach the usurper with his weak title, to set up her daugh- 
 ter's claim in opposition to his, and to defy him to the field. As 
 soon as Henry departed, her suppressed emotions found vent in 
 tears. Elizabeth was astonished : she knelt before her, caressed 
 her, and asked if all were not well now, since the plighted troth 
 had passed between her and the king. 
 
 " Has it passed ?" murmured the queen ; " and is your hapless 
 fate decided? Why did I not join you at Sheriff Hutton? 
 Why did I not place your hand in that of your noble cousin ? 
 Ah, Warwick ! could I even now inspire you with my energy, 
 you would be free in arms ; and England to a man would rise in 
 the cause of Edward the Sixth, and my sweet Elizabeth!" 
 
 The colour in the princess's cheeks varied during the utter- 
 ance of this speech ; first they flushed deep red, but the pale 
 hue of resolution succeeded quickly to the agitation of doubt. 
 "Mother," she said, "I was your child; plastic clay in your 
 hands ; had you said these words two hours ago, Warwick 
 might have been liberated — I perhaps happy. But you have 
 given me away ; this ring is the symbol of my servitude ; I 
 belong to Henry. Say no word, I beseech you, that can inter- 
 fere with my duty to him. Permit me to retire." 
 
 On the eighteenth of January her nuptials were celebrated. 
 
 The forbidding manners of Henry threw a chill over the 
 marriage festival. He considered that he had been driven to 
 this step by his enemies ; and that the chief among these, 
 influenced by her mother, was Elizabeth herself. The poor girl 
 never raised her eyes from the moment she had encountered at 
 the altar the stern and unkind glance of the king. Her steps 
 were unassured, her voice faltering ; the name of wife was to 
 her synonymous with that of slave, while her sense of duty pre- 
 vented every outward demonstration of the despair that occupied 
 her heart. 
 
 Her mother's indignation was deeper, although not less 
 veiled. She could silence, but not quell, the rage that arose in 
 her breast from her disappointment j and there were many

 present who shared her sentiments. As far as he had been able, 
 Henry had visited the Yorkists with the heaviest penalties. An. 
 act of attainder had been passed against the duke of Norfolk, 
 Lord Lovel, the Staffords, and all indeed of note who had 
 appeared against him. Those with whom he could not proceed 
 to extremities, he wholly discountenanced. The Red Eose 
 flourished brio^ht and free — one single white blossom, doomed 
 to untimely blight, being entwined with the gaudier flowers. 
 
 CHAPTER IV. 
 
 LADY BEAMPTON. 
 
 My noble queen, let former grudges pass, 
 And henceforth I am thy true servitor. 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 Meanwhile the Yorkists were impatient for action. The 
 existence of Prince Richard was a secret to all save Lincoln and 
 Lovel — even the Staffords were kept in ignorance ; their purpose, 
 therefore, was merely to put down the Lancastrians, and to 
 raise their own party, with Warwick or Lincoln at their head ; 
 they cared not which, so that they got a king who would, in his 
 turn, uproot the Red Rose. Lincoln would consent to no 
 decisive step ; but from the day of his cousin's marriage, all his 
 emissaries and friends were on foot to cause insurrectionary 
 movements in the kingdom, rousing in the old Yorkists their 
 ancient party spirit, and inspiring the young with hopes of 
 future aggrandizement and victory. 
 
 As the spring advanced, Henry sent the young queen, with 
 her mother and sisters, and the countess of Richmond, to hold 
 her court at Winchester, while he resolved on a progress through 
 the northern counties of England, the most affected towards the 
 House of York, to endeavour, by the royal presence, to 
 awaken affection towards the reigning sovereign. He passed 
 the festival of Easter at Lincoln, and there he heard that Lord 
 Lovel and the two Staffords had escaped from sanctuary. The 
 sound of insurrection is fearful to a newly-anointed king ; but 
 as no explanation was given to their movements, and no name of 
 import mingled in the tale, he felt less perturbation at this 
 intelligence. As he proceeded on his journey, the affair took a

 more serious aspect. The Staffords advanced to besiege Wor- 
 cester ; and Lovel, with an increasing army of three or four 
 thousand men, was in the neighbourhood of York. 
 
 Sir Edward Brampton joined the forces of Lord Lovel, and 
 he and Lady Brampton again met. The history of this lady 
 was singular. Ten years before the time of which we write, 
 being then eighteen, she married, and attended the court of 
 Edward the Fourth. She had talent and vivacity ; her dark 
 laughing eyes, the animation of her countenance, her gay and 
 naive manners, attracted her sovereign ; and she was soon dis- 
 tinguished as one whose advancement, if so it might be called, 
 to the highest influence over him, depended on her own choice 
 between honour and such preferment. She did not hesitate ; 
 but her rejection won Edward as much as her beauty. A kind 
 of friendship, kept up under the chivalrous phraseology of the 
 day, was established between them, that gave, perhaps, more 
 umbrage to the queen than a less avowed connection would have 
 done. All was open ; and if the good humour of her young 
 rival never permitted her to assume haughtiness, there was 
 something even more revolting in her girlish assumptions of 
 power and consequence. The queen hated and affected to 
 despise Lady Brampton ; Lady Brampton felt that she injured 
 the wife of Edward the Fourth. At first she had earnestly 
 sought to gain her favour, but when rebuffed, she resorted to 
 the weapons of youth, beauty, and wit, and set at defiance the 
 darkened brow of Elizabeth. Ten years had passed since then. 
 
 Edward the Fourth died, and under Eiehard the Third Lady 
 Brampton returned to her natural place in society ; nay, the 
 vivacity of speech with which she defended the rights of his 
 nephews, made him absolutely discountenance her. In her days 
 of pride she had refused every mark of favour from Edward, 
 thus to place their avowed friendship far above the petty intrigues 
 of the courtiers. It might have been thought that the queen 
 and her rival would now, on the grounds of affection for Edward's 
 children, have leagued together ; but, on the contrary, the mother 
 expressed contempt and indignation at the presumption of Lady 
 Brampton in assuming a personal interest in her children, and 
 that lady too \v'ell remembered how often her manner and 
 speech must have offended the queen to make any vain attempt 
 at reconciliation. The earl of Lincoln and Lady "Brampton had 
 always been friends ; her liveliness amused him, her integrity 
 and real goodness of heart won his esteem. Her passionate 
 love for the princes in the Tower had caused him, when he 
 withdrew thence the young Eiehard, whose ill-health demanded 
 constant feminine attentions, to confide him to her charge ; thus 
 she alone became possessed of the secret of his existeace, and

 now with Lord Lovel she debated liow best liis interests could 
 be furthered. 
 
 Lord Lincoln feared by rash measures to endanger the safety 
 of his nephew. He desired to place him on the throne, but he 
 preferred bringing him up in freedom and obscurity to any ill- 
 judged attempt that might throw him into his enemy's hands, 
 and make him prisoner for life. His plans were all laid upon this 
 principle ; he commanded Lord Lovel, who submitted wholly to 
 him, not to breathe the name of the son of Edward till he had 
 gained a decided advantage over the reigning sovereign. If 
 victorious, he might set up the royal standard and proclaim 
 Richard the Fourth, while the earl, still in London, would call 
 together all the Yorkists, and, in the absence of the king, seize, 
 in his nephew's name, upon the capital of the kingdom. If 
 Lord Lovel's attempt proved unsuccessful, it was decided that 
 the prince should escape immediately to the Continent, there to 
 remain till some new insurrection was organized ; for, though 
 cautious, he was resolute, and he had determined never to relin- 
 quish his purpose, but to excite rebellion and discontent against 
 Henry till the rightful heir possessed his own. 
 
 These plans were in contradiction to Lady Brampton's views, 
 but she was obliged to submit. Her quick woman's wit dis- 
 covered her another danger. The absolute silence observed 
 concerning the young prince, then only eleven years of age, 
 might in the end cast a doubt over the justice of his pretensions, 
 and she told Lord Lovel, that if, after a failure, Eichard quitted 
 England, he must first be seen and acknowledged by his mother. 
 She resolved, therefore, on immediately going to Winchester to 
 prepare Elizabeth for the reception of her son ; and Lord Lovel, 
 who agreed in the wisdom of this proposal, promised, at all 
 hazards, that ere leaving the kingdom the duke of York should 
 cross the country to that town, whence, by Southampton, he 
 might escape to France. While, therefore. Lord Lovel increased 
 his army, and marched in high hopes towards York, Lady 
 Brampton proceeded southward, meditating the safest and best 
 manner of introducing herself to the queen. 
 
 There was a man, Eichard Simon, or Symond, who afterwards 
 figured in the chronicles, that had long been secretly concerned 
 in the course of events. He was the son of a tenant of Sir 
 John Gray, and had been the playmate of the Lady Elizabeth 
 Gray's elder children. His love of books, his sedentary habits, 
 and quick wit on matters of learning, led those interested in his 
 fate to consider him fitted for the church, and tlierefore, he took 
 priest's orders. But his mind, though not attuned to action in 
 its noblest sense, was not one that could remain at rest. He 
 loved power j he was sagacious, astute, and intriguing: when

 tLe Lady Gray became queen, lie being still too yonng for high 
 promotion, preferred an unnoticed but influential situation near 
 her person to more lucrative employ, wliicb vrould remove him 
 from the pleasures and dignity of the conrt. When Edward 
 died, he devoted himself to the service of his royal patroness, 
 and hardly escaped being imprisoned for life by liichard, when 
 the latter was most exasperated against the queen-dowager's 
 relations. From that time Richard Simon found full occupation 
 for his plotting head, in endeavouring to bring about the over- 
 throw of the usurping Gloucester, and to raise the hopes of 
 Henry the Seventh, who requited ill his active zeal: and now 
 again he busied himself in exalting the queen's party. He looked 
 the man he was — a prier into secrets— one who conducted the 
 drama of life by back-stairs and tell-tale valets : his small grey 
 eyes were quick to discern the meaning of each smile or frown ; 
 his young brow was already wrinkled through care and thought ; 
 craft lurked in the corners of his lips ; and his whispering voice 
 betokened habitual caution. He continued to hover near the 
 queen ; now despatched to sound some Yorkist, now. closeted to 
 discuss some expression of the king's, in w^hich to find a secret 
 meanins:. Eepose was the thing he hated : and for ever with 
 some plan on foot, some web to weave or unravel, he was seen 
 with brows a little elevated by self-conceit, with a courtly bend 
 of the body, and insinuating address, now assuring a Lancastrian 
 of the perfect satisfaction of the queen, now whispering to a 
 Yorkist a tale of slights and injuries practised by King Henry 
 against his consort and her friends. All the communication that 
 had taken place between Elizabeth Woodville and the earl of 
 Lincoln had been carried on through this man, though each knew 
 not that he communicated to the other what either said. But 
 Lincoln respected his undeviating fidelity towards his patroness, 
 and valued his talents. It was to this man that Lady Brampton 
 addressed herself on her arrival at Winchester, to procure for 
 her a private audience with the queen. Her dark hints respecting 
 the insurrection of Lovel and the Stafibrds excited his curiosity, 
 yet he experienced more difficulty than he expected in bringing 
 the royal dowager to consent to receive her rival. When our 
 days of prosperity are fled we cling fondly to all that reminds us 
 of their brightness, and turn with augmented distaste from 
 everthing that marred their splendour. Elizabeth loved to 
 remember herself as the chosen bride of Edward, and any 
 circumstance that spoke of his inconstancy, or detracted from 
 the entireness of her influence over him, then inspired her with 
 indignation, now with abhorrence. It required all Simon's 
 dexterity to allay her anger, and excite her curiosity, sufficiently 
 to induce her to admit her rival to her presence.

 Ifc was at the hour of vespers that the priest introduced Lady 
 Brampton into the queen's cabinet. Elizabeth was assured that 
 she had secrets of importance to communicate, and she designed 
 by afFabilitj to win her to a full disclosure of them. Yet her 
 heart and manner grew cold as she entered the closet where the 
 ladj and her guide already were, and bending her head slightly, 
 she said, '.* The Lady Brampton desired an audience with me — 
 I grant it." 
 
 \Y\th. all her vivacity and consciousness of the importance of 
 her disclosures, the lady felt herself awed and chilled ; and the 
 memory of Edward came across her, who had before shielded 
 her from such unkindness, and filled her eyes with tears. A long 
 pause ensued ; the queen looked as in expectation, and Hichard 
 Simon, who had retired to an embrasure of a window, was about 
 to come forward, when Lady Brampton, conquering her emotion, 
 said, " Your grace is the happy mother of the queen of England, 
 and the hope of an heir, which you now entertain, may make my 
 inteUigence distasteful." 
 
 "Say on," replied Elizabeth, haughtily ; "I listen to your 
 words." 
 
 The lady felt much inclined not to say another word, but 
 assuming almost equal coldness of manner, she continued, "Would 
 your grace prefer that your fair daughter should still bear the 
 sceptre, or that Richard the Fourth should wrest it from the 
 husband's grasp ?" 
 
 Now indeed the queen started, and cried impetuously, 
 ** I charge you, trifle with me no longer ! Explain your words ; 
 who would supplant my child ? " 
 
 " Her brother," Lady Brampton replied ; and seeing the 
 queen lost in a mixture of amazement and terror, she added, 
 " The Duke of York still lives : he is now, I trust, at the head 
 of forces sufficient to enforce his rights. In a few days 
 England will acknowledge him as sovereign." 
 
 In reply to these words, spoken with rapidity, as if they were 
 pregnant with supreme delight to their audiiress, the queen 
 with an angry look, said, "I shall league with no plotters to 
 establish an impostor." 
 
 "Beware," said Lady Brampton, indignantly; "let your 
 majesty bethink yourself before you consign your son to 
 misery and an early grave. AVill his mother be his chief 
 enemy ? " 
 
 " Who vouches for him ? " 
 
 "Himself! He is the very Edward who once was yours: 
 his young features are but the miniature mirror of his royal 
 father ; his princely grace, his wit, his courage, are all derived 
 from him."

 "I must see the boy," said tlie queen, "to end at once tliis 
 silly masque. How do you pretend that he escaped foHii the 
 Tower?" 
 
 The independence and sensibility of Lady Brampton's dis- 
 position would not permit her to answer a question asked thus 
 ironically. Had she looked at the queen, she might have seen, 
 by her chant^e of countenance, that it was nearly all put on by 
 the jealous instinct that would not permit her to acknowledge 
 herself under so great an obligation to ber rival. Lady Bramp- 
 ton turned to Simon, saying, " I am ready to depart, Sir Priest ; 
 I see her grace sorrows that the same cold bed does not entomb 
 Eichard of York and Edward the Fifth. Poor prince ! My 
 Lord of Lincoln counselled well, and I was to blame in not 
 acting on his advice." 
 
 " Stay," cried Elizabeth, " speak again. Is the earl of Lin- 
 coln a party to this tale ? " 
 
 "Your majesty insults me," said the lady ; "I came here to 
 please a mother's ear by assurances of her son's safety, and to 
 conduct the tempest-tost fortunes of this ill-starred boy into the 
 safe harbour of maternal love. I came with a full heart and an 
 ardent desire to serve you ; no other motive could have led me 
 hither. You receive me with disdain ; you dismiss me with 
 contumely. I fear that so much you hate me, that, for my sake, 
 your heart is steeled against your princely son. But as you 
 already know so much as to make it necessary that you should 
 know all, I will hasten to London, and intreat the noble De la 
 Poole to communicate with you, and to avert a mother's enmity 
 from her child. I take my leave." 
 
 She was about to depart ; but Simon, who knew that a feud 
 between the prince's partizans must ruin his cause, entreated 
 her to remain ; and then addressing the queen, tried to soothe 
 her, for she was pacing the rushes of her chamber in excessive 
 agitation. "Peace, good friend," said she, "I will speak to 
 Lincoln ; I will ask him why I, who was deemed by his honoured 
 uncle fit partaker of his councils, am kept by him in ignorance 
 of the alleged existence of this poor boy ? Even now he might 
 be sitting on the throne, had I been consulted : instead of 
 this, to what has this distrust brought him ? He is a crown- 
 less king, a fugitive prince, branded as an impostor ; a seal is 
 put on his fate, which nothing probably will ever remove. I, 
 even I, have called my son, if such he be, a counterfeit ! " 
 
 Maternal tenderness touched to the quick the royal lady's 
 heart, and she wept. Lady Brampton was all impulse and 
 goodness of disposition: she felt that Elizabeth had wronged 
 her, but in a moment she forgave the offence ; she advanced, 
 and kneeling at her feet, touched her hand gently, as she said,

 ** Let not your grace judge too harslilj of our proccedlnf^s.

 to them, attempts to bring the royal exile to his mother's arms. 
 "Would that my humility could appease your displeasure, and 
 that you would acknowledge me your faithful follower. My life 
 should be at the disposal of you and the princely York." 
 
 Lady Brampton, full of vivacity, energy, and even of iui- 
 periousness, had so much grace in her manner and sweetness in 
 her voice, when she laid these keen weapons aside to assume 
 those of gentleness and love, that she was irresistible. The 
 queen, at once softened, stretched out her hand, which the lady 
 pressed respectfully to her lips ; then, as friends bent on one 
 design, they conversed unreservedly together. Lady Brampton 
 entered into long details concerning the past history of the 
 duke of York, and the schemes then on foot for his advance- 
 ment. This was not their sole interview ; they met again and 
 again, and mutual affection confirming the link which the fate 
 of E-ichard caused to exist between them, the queen named the 
 Lady Brampton one of her ladies, and henceiorth they lived 
 together under the same roof.

 SfliiLLEY. 
 
 The historical account of Lord Lovel's insurrection is contained 
 in a few words. While the two StafFords besieged Worcester, 
 tliis nobleman advanced a^jainst Henry in York. The duke of 
 Bedford was sent against him, -who published a creneral pardon, 
 for ail the rebels -who should submit. The soldiers of Lord 
 Lovel had no powerful watch-word to insure their union ; the 
 existence of Edward the Fourth's son was a profound secret; 
 they were therefore easily induced to abandon an almost nameless 
 cause ; and in three weeks Lord Lovel found himself with only 
 one hundred adherents, or rather personal friends, who at his 
 earnest entreaty disbanded, while he, chiefly bent on saving the 
 life of his princely charge, felt greater security in being left 
 singly with him. 
 
 He had promised to traverse England, and to conduct him to 
 Winchester ; but the hot pursuit on foot forced him to delay 
 this journey. Meanwhile a present refuge was to be sought. 
 He had a stanch friend in a zealous Yorkist, Sir Thomas 
 Broughton, who resided in Lancashire, to whose residence he 
 directed his steps. Still, even during this short journey, great pre- 
 caution was necessary. Lord Lovel and his charge travelled dis- 
 guised, avoiding highroads and great towns. On the second 
 evening, when the red aspect of the setting sun threatened an 
 inclement night, they took shelter in a lone cot, on one of the 
 wild moors of that county. 
 
 A long habit of personal attendance had instilled into Lovel's 
 mind a parental aftection for the little prince. They had jour- 
 neyed far that day, and Richard was overpowered by fatigue ; 
 his friend strewed for him a bed of leaves — he stretched himself 
 on it, and quickly fell into a sound sleep, while the noble kept 
 up the fire he had lighted, and paced the hut, revolving in his 
 mind a thousand schemes. It was a chill February evening ; 
 and, as night came on, a thick sleet beat against the windows,

34 THE INTERVIEW. • 
 
 Tvhile tlie wind, sweeping over tlie wide heatli, howled round the 
 miserable slieplierd's cot. Some time passed thus, and fear in 
 Lovel's mind gave place to the sense of security, inspired by the 
 desolation of the spot and the inclemency of the elements. He 
 needed rest, and as soon as he had thrown himself on the ground, 
 drowsiness overpowered him — the wind sang a wild lullaby to 
 both the sleepers. 
 
 Though still lost to the outer world, a change passed over 
 Lovel's countenance — again his features relaxed into sleep, and 
 again expressed disquietude. The tramp of horses' feet was 
 around the hut — voices mingled alien sounds with the raging 
 blast ; — at last a loud knocking at the door caused the noble at 
 once to start on his feet wide awake. Hichard still slept on. 
 Lord Lovel cautiously withdrew into the shadow behind the 
 door, listening intently to divine the motives of these unwelcome 
 intruders. He felt assured that they were emissaries of Henry, 
 who had traced him hither ; he endeavoured to form in his mind 
 some plan of conduct to save the duke, whom he was about to 
 awaken and put on his guard, when a woman's voice struck upon 
 his ear. The knocking at the door was changed into a violent 
 beating, the rude hinges gave way, and it swung back. The 
 fugitive's heart beat quick ; it was a moment full of fate ; such 
 a one as, when passed, we seem to have concentrated a life into 
 its small space. The man that entered calmed his fears ; low in 
 stature, broadly built, a cloak lined with furs added to his bulk, 
 and a Flemish hat completed his peaceable appearance ; though 
 he was too much muffled to show his face. Glancing at Lovel a 
 look which was, doubtless, intended to convey reproach, he mut- 
 tered some words in a foreign guttural language, and went back 
 to his companions. Two women now entered, both enveloped ia 
 furs. One stepped lightly on, and drew the bench, which had 
 lately pillowed the head of Lovel, closer to the fire, while the 
 other, bending under the burthen in her arms, approached slower, 
 and sitting down on the seat prepared for her, threw back her 
 cloak, and discovered that she bore in her arms a sleeping child, 
 about six years of aije. The first, meanwhile, disencumbered 
 herself of her rich furs, and then leaning over the child, kissed 
 its little hands, and regarded its sleeping form with mingled 
 anxiety and tenderness, speaking to the other in a foreign dialect, 
 evidently about the risk the poor babe had run from exposure to 
 the weather. Lovel remained a mute spectator ; he resolved 
 not to come forward till he should see who their male attend- 
 ants were. After a brief interval the first intruder again entered ; 
 he threw off his cloak, and looking round with keen eyes, the 
 fugitive discovered the well-known features of a friend. His 
 heart now relieved, his countenance lighted up, and he stepped

 forward, sayinj^ : " Mynheer Jalin Warbeck, God be witli you ! 
 you travel on a stormy nigjht." 
 
 " And you, Lord Lovel," replied tbe money-lender, anjrrily, 
 *' are sufficiently discourteous to wanderers at suck a season. 
 Why even vipers are harmless durina^ a storm." 
 
 " But fair weather returns, and they a^^ain find their stingy. I 
 might bare my own breast, but — " he pointed to the bed of 
 leaves, on which, in spite of the tumult, young E-iehard still 
 slept. 
 
 "Warbeck started : but before he could reply, one of his com- 
 panions turned to speak to him, and a conversation ensued, 
 begun in Dutch, and continued in French, concerning the cir- 
 cumstances which had divided them from their attendants, and 
 their fatiguing wanderings during the storm. A small saddle- 
 bag was produced by Warbeck, containing a few provisions. A 
 bed for the sleeping child was formed, and the travellers sat 
 round the fire, enjoying their simple fare. From time to time 
 the fair blue eyes of the younger lady, who was evidently the 
 mistress, and the other an attendant, turned to look on the chi- 
 valric form and manly beauty of Lovel ; a few smiling observa- 
 tions escaped her in her native language, which Warbeck 
 answered drily and succinctly. The bench on which the lady 
 sat was soon sacrificed for firing — the cloaks of the party were 
 dried, and the women, wrapt in them, sought repose on the bare 
 ground, which was the sole flooring of the hut, the younger 
 drawing to her bosom the sleeping child. Lovel and Warbeck 
 kept silence, till the deep breathing of their companions showed 
 that they slept: then, in reply to the Fleming's questions, Lovel 
 related the history of the last months, and at the conclusion 
 frankly asked his advice and assistance in accomplishing his 
 design of conveying the duke of York to Winchester. Warbeck 
 looked thoughtful on this demand, and after a pause said, " I 
 cannot say wherefore this unfortunate prince excites so strong an 
 interest in me ; for in truth my heart yearns towards him as if 
 he were akin to me. Is it because he bore for a time my poor 
 boy's name? " 
 
 Warbeck paused ; his hard features were strongly marked by 
 grief — " I and my sister," he continued, " crossed the country to 
 visit my Peterkin, who was ill — who is lost to me now for ever." 
 
 A pause again ensued : the young soldier respected too much 
 the father's grief to interrupt it. At length the Fleming said, 
 *' Lord Lovel, I will — I trust I can — save Duke E-ichard's life. 
 My sister is kind-hearted ; and the silence you have observed 
 concerning the very existence of King Edward's son makes the 
 task more easy. Madeline is about to return to her own country ; 
 she was to have taken my Peterkin with her. Let the prince

 aj^ain assume that name : it shall be my care to escort him in this 
 character to Winchester; and at Portsmouth they may embark, 
 ■while you follow your own plans, and take refuge with the friends 
 you mention in these parts." 
 
 As AYarbeck spoke, Lovel motioned to him to observe his 
 sister, who, unable to sleep, was observinc^ them with attention. 
 " Madeline does not understand our English," said her brother ; 
 *'but it were well that she joined our counsels, which may con- 
 tinue in French. I have your leave, my lord, to disclose your 
 secret to her? Fear her not : she would die rather than injure 
 one hair of that poor child's head," 
 
 OiiWarbeck's invitation, the lady rose; and he,taking her hand, 
 led her to the low couch of the duke of York. Sleep and gentle 
 dreams spread an irradiation of beauty over him : his glowing 
 cheek, his eyes hardly closed, the masses of rich auburn hair that 
 •clustered on a brow of infantine smoothness and candour, the little 
 hand and arm, which, thrown above his head, gave an air of help- 
 lessness to his attitude, combined to form a picture of childish grace 
 and sweetness, which no woman, and that woman a mother, could 
 look on without emotions of tenderness. "What an angelic 
 child," said the fair sister of Warbeck, as she stooped to kiss his 
 rosy cheek ; " what a noble-looking boy. Who is he ?" 
 
 "One proscribed," said the cavalier; "one whom he who 
 reigns over England would consign to a dungeon. Were he to 
 fall into the hands of his enemies, they might not, indeed, dare 
 not cut him off violently ; but they would consume and crush 
 him, by denying him all that contributes to health and life." 
 
 " Can this sweet boy have enemies?" cried the lady : " Ah ! 
 if he have, has he not friends also to guard him from them?" 
 
 " With our lives !" he replied, emphatically ; " but that is a 
 small sacrifice and a useless one ; for, to preserve him we must 
 preserve ourselves. My life, — such acts deserve no record, — I 
 have, and will again and again expose for him ; but the will to 
 save him is not enough witiiout the power ; and that power you 
 possess, lady, to a far, far greater extent than I." 
 
 " The will I have most certainly," said the fair one, regarding 
 the boy with anxious tenderness. " Command me, sire chevalier; 
 ray power, small as I must believe it to be, and my will, shall 
 unite to preserve this sweet child." 
 
 Warbeck disclosed briefly to his sister the secret of young 
 Hichard's birth, and detailed his plan for his safe journey to 
 Winchester ; nay, and after that, for his crossing the sea, and 
 continuing to personate, in Flanders, the nephew of Madeline, if 
 so his royal mother deemed fitting, till the moment should arrive, 
 when the schemes of his partizans being crowned with success, 
 he could be restored to his country and his birthright. The fair

 Fleming joyfully assented to this proposition, and entered cordi- 
 ally into the details. Lovel was profuse of thanks : so suddenly 
 and so easily to be relieved from his worst fears, appeared like 
 the special interposition of some guardian saint. His heart 
 overflowed with gratitude ; and his glistening eyes gave token of 
 greater thanks than even his emphatic words. Madeline felt 
 all the excitement of being actively employed in a deed of 
 benevolence : her calm features were animated with an angelic 
 expression. The discussion of details demanding the coolest 
 prudence and most vigilant observation, long occupied them : and 
 the lady brought a woman's tact and keen penetration to arrange 
 the crude designs of her brother. All was rendered smooth ; 
 every obstacle foreseen and obviated ; every pass of danger 
 reconnoitered and provided for. When, at last, their plans were 
 perfected, the lady again returned to her hard couch to seek 
 repose : for some time the cavalier and the Fleming kept watch, 
 till they also, in such comfortless posture as they might, stretched 
 on the bare ground, yielded to drowsiness ; and grey morning 
 found all the dwellers in the sheepcot sunk in profound sleep. 
 Fear, charity, hope, and love, might colour their dreams ; but 
 quiet slumber possessed them all, driving care and thought from 
 the heart and brain, to steep both in oblivion of all ill. 
 
 When Madeline awoke in the morning, the first sight that 
 met her eyes was the lovely boy she had promised to protect, 
 playing with her dark-eyed girl, who displayed all the ecstaey of 
 childish glee with her new playmate. Madeline was a blonde 
 Fleming, with light blue eyes and flaxen ringlets — she was about 
 five-and-t^renty years of age ; an expression of angelic goodness 
 animated her features, bestowing on them an appearance of 
 loveliness, which of themselves they did not possess. It could 
 hardly be guessed, that Richard's playmate was the daughter of 
 the fair-haired Fleming : but the husband of Warbeck's sister 
 was a Spaniard, and the child resembled her father in everything 
 except the soft mouth and sweet smile, which was all her mother's : 
 her large full dark eyes gave to her infantine face a look of sen- 
 sibility far beyond her years. The little girl ran to her mother 
 when she awoke ; and Madeline caressed both her and the prince 
 with the greatest tenderness. They stood at the door of the 
 cottage ; the early sun shone brightly on the hoar frost that 
 covered the moor ; the keen air was bracing, though cold ; the 
 morning was cheerful, such as inspires hope and animation, a 
 lively wit to understand, and a roused courage to meet difilculties. 
 
 Madelme turned from the glittering scene to look on her 
 young charge — his eyes were fixed on her face. " How beautiful 
 and good you look," said the boy. 
 
 -•* I am glad that you think me good," replied the lady, smihngj

 " you will have less fear in trusting yourself with me : your 
 noble friend has confided your grace to my care, if, indeed, you 
 will condescend to live with me, and be as a son to me. I have 
 just lost a little nephew whom I fonely loved ; will you supply 
 his place, and take his name ? " 
 
 " Fair cousin," said the prince, caressing his kind friend as he 
 spoke, " I will wait on you, and serve you as no nephew ever 
 served. What name did your lost kinsman bear ? Quickly tell 
 me, that I may know my own, and hereafter call myself by it." 
 
 *' Perkin Warbeck," said Madeline. 
 
 " Now you mock me," cried Richard : "that has long been my 
 name ; but I knew not that it gave me a claim to so pretty a 
 relation." 
 
 " This courtly languao:e," replied the lady, " betrays your 
 grace's princeliness. What will our Flemish boors say, when I 
 present the nursling of royalty as mine? You will shame our 
 homely breeding, Duke Hichard." 
 
 " I beseech you, fair mistress," said Lovel, who now joined 
 them, "to forget, even in private, such high-sounding titles. It 
 is dangerous to play at majesty, unaided by ten thousand armed 
 asserters of our right. Hemember this noble child only as your 
 loving nephew, Perkin Warbeck : he, who well knows the misery 
 of regal claims unallied to regal authority, will shelter himself 
 gladly and gratefully under the shadow of your louly bower." 
 
 And now, as the wintry sun rose higher, the travellers pre- 
 pared for their departure. Warbeck first left them to find and to 
 dismiss his domestics, who would have been aware of the decep- 
 tion practised in the person of Richard. He returned in a few 
 hours for his sister. The duke and Lord Lovel then separated. 
 The intervening time had been employed by the noble in school- 
 ing the boy as to his future behaviour, in recounting to him his 
 plans and hopes, and in instructing him how to conduct himself 
 with his mother, if indeed he saw her ; for Lovel was ignorant 
 how Lady Brampton had succeeded at Winchester, and how far 
 it would be possible to bring about an interview between the 
 queen and her son. At length Warbeck returned ; the travellers 
 mounted, and Lord Lovel, watching from the cottage door, 
 beheld with melancholy regret the prince depart : the long habit 
 of intercourse, the uncertain future, his high pretensions, and 
 his present state, had filled the cavalier with moody thoughts, 
 unlike his usual sanguine anticipations, and energetic resolves. 
 " This is womanly," at last he thought, as the reflection that ho 
 was alone, and had, perhaps, seen his belov^ed charge for the last 
 time, filled his eyes with unwonted tears. " To horse ! To my 
 friends ! — There to plan, scheme, devise — and then again to the 
 field ! "

THE INTERVIEW. 39 
 
 Days and weeks passed, replete M'itli doubt aud anxiety to the 
 queen and her enthusiastic friend at Winchester. Each day, 
 many, many times, Lady Brampton visited the cathedral to 
 observe whether the silver heart was suspended near the altar, 
 which she had ag^reed with Lord Lovel should be the sign of the 
 duke's arrival. The part Elizabeth "VYoodville had to play mean- 
 while was difficult and painful — she lived in constant intercourse 
 with the countess of Richmond ; the wishes and thoughts of all 
 around were occupied by the hope of an heir to the crown, which 
 the young queen would soon bestow on England. The birth of 
 a son, it was prognosticated, would win her husband's affection, 
 and all idea of future disturbance, of further risings and dis- 
 loyalty, through the existence of this joint offspring of the two 
 E-oses, would be for ever at an end. While these hopes and 
 expectations formed, it was supposed, the most flattering and 
 agreeable subject of congratulation for the dowager queen, she 
 remained sleepless and watchful, under the anticipation of seeing 
 her fugitive son, the outcast and discrowned claimant of all that 
 was to become the birthright of the unborn child. 
 
 At length the unwearied cares of Lady Brampton were 
 rewarded ; a small silver heart, bearing the initials of Richard, 
 duke of York, was suspended near the shrine ; and as she 
 turned to look who placed it there, the soft voice of Madeline 
 uttered the word of recognition agreed upon ; joy filled Lady 
 Brampton's heart, as the brief answers to her hurried questions 
 assured her of Richard's safety. The same evening she visited, 
 in disguise, the abode of Warbeck, and embraced, in a transport 
 of delight, the princely boy, in whose fate she interested herself 
 with all the fervour of her warm heart. She now learnt the 
 design Lord Lovel had of placing Richard in safety under 
 Madeline's care in Flanders, until his friends had prepared for 
 him a triumphant return to England. She concerted with her 
 new friends the best mode of introducing Richard into his 
 mother's presence ; and it was agreed that, early on the following 
 morning, Madeline and the duke should seek one of the small 
 chapels of the cathedral of Winchester, and that Elizabeth 
 should there meet her son. With an overflowing heart, Lady 
 Brampton returned to communicate this intelligence to the royal 
 widow, and to pass with her the intervening hours in oft-renewed 
 conjectures and anticipations concerning the duke of York. 
 
 To modern and Protestant England, a cathedral or a church 
 may appear a strange place for private assignations and concealed 
 meetings. It was otherwise in the days of our ancestors, when, 
 through similarity of religion, our manners bore a greater resem- 
 blance than they now do to those of foreign countries. The 
 churches stood always open, ready to receive the penitent, who

 souglit the stillness of the holy asylum the more entirely to con- 
 centrate his thoughts in prayer. As rank did not exempt its 
 possessors from sin nor sorrow, neither did it from acts of 
 penitence, nor from those visitations of anguish, when the sacred 
 temple was sought, as bringing the votarist into more immediate 
 communication with the Deity. The queen dowager excited, 
 therefore, no suspicion, when, with her rosary formed of the 
 blessed wood of Lebanon encased in gold in her hand, with 
 Lady Brampton for her sole afteudant, she sought at five in the 
 morning the dark aisle of the cathedral of "Winchester, there to 
 perform her religious duties. Two figures already knelt near 
 the altar of the chapel designated as the place of meeting ; 
 Elizabeth's breath came thick, her knees bent under her, she 
 leaned against a buttress, while a fair-haired boy turned at the 
 sound. He first looked timidly on her, and then, encouraged 
 by the smile that visited her quivering lips, he sprung forward, 
 and kneeling at her feet, buried his face in her dress, sobbing, 
 while, bending over him, her own tears fell on his glossy hair. 
 Lady Brampton and Madeline retired up the aisle, leaving the 
 mother and child alone. 
 
 " Look up, my Eichard," cried the unfortunate widow ; " look 
 up, son of King Edward, — my noble, my outcast boy ! Thou 
 art much grown — much altered since I last saw thee. Thou art 
 more like thy blessed father than thy infancy promised." She 
 parted his curls on his brow, and looked on him with the very 
 soul of maternal tenderness. " Ah ! were I a cottager," she 
 continued, " though bereft of my husband, I should collect my 
 3'oung ones round me, and forget sorrow. I should toil for 
 them, and they v.ould learn to toil for me. How sweet the food 
 my industry procured for them, how hallowed that winch their 
 maturer strength would bestow on me ! I am the mother of 
 princes. Yain boast ! I am childless ! " 
 
 The queen, lost in thought, scarcely heard the gentle voice of 
 her son who replied by expressions of endearment, nor felt his 
 caresses ; but collecting her ideas, she called to mind how brief 
 tlie interview must be, and how she was losing many preciout 
 moments in vain exclamations and regrets, llecovering that 
 calm majesty which usually characterized her, she said : 
 " Pvichard, arise ! our minutes are counted, and each must be 
 freighted with the warning and wisdom of years. Thou art 
 young, my son ! but Lady Brampton tells me that thy under- 
 standing is even premature; thy experience indeed must be small, 
 but I will try to adapt my admonitions to that experience. 
 Should you fail to understand me, do not on that account aespise 
 my lessons, but treasure them up till thy increased years reveal 
 their meaning to thee, AYe may never meet again ; for onpo

 separated, ten thousand swords, and twice ten thousand dangers 
 divide us perhaps for ever. I feel even now that it is given to 
 me to bless thee for the last time, and I would fain to the last be 
 the cause of good to thee. I have lived, ah I how long; and 
 suffered, methinks, beyond human suffering ; let the words I 
 now utter live in thy soul for ever ; my soul is in them ! Will 
 not my son respect the sacred yearnings of his mother's heart?' 
 
 Touched, penetrated by this exordium, the tearful boy pro- 
 mised attention and obedience. Elizabeth sat on a low tomb, 
 Eichard knelt before her ; one kiss she i.-nprinted on his young 
 brow, while endeavouring to still the beating of her heart, and to 
 command the trembling of her voice. She was silent for a few 
 moments. Eichard looked up to her with mingled love and awe ; 
 wisdom seemed to beam from her eyes, and the agitation that 
 quivered on her lips gave solemnity to the tone with which she 
 addressed her young auditor. 
 
 She spoke of his early prospects, his long imprisonment, and 
 late fortunes. She descanted on the character of Henry 
 Tudor, describing him as wise and crafty, and to be feared. 
 She dwelt on the character of the earl of Lincoln and other 
 chiefs of the house of York, and mentioned how uneasily 
 they bore the downfall of their party. No pains, no artifice, 
 no risk, she said, would be spared by any one of them to 
 elevate an offspring of the AVhite Eose, and to annihilate the 
 pretensions and power of Lancaster. " Still a boy, unmeet 
 for such contest, noble blood will be shed for you, my son," 
 she continued ; " and while you are secluded by those vrho 
 love you from danger, many lives will be spent for your sake. 
 We shall hazard all for you ; and all may prove too little for 
 success. We may fail, and you be thrown upon j^our own 
 guidance, your unformed judgment, and childish indiscretion. 
 Alas ! what will then be your fate ? Your kinsmen and partizans 
 slain — your mother broken-hearted, it may be, dead !— spies will 
 on every side environ you, nets will be spread to ensnare you, 
 daggers sharpened for your destruction. You must oppose pru- 
 dence to craft, nor, until your young hand can wield a man's 
 weapon, dare attempt aught against Henry's power. Never 
 forget that you are a king's son, yet suffer not unquiet ambition 
 to haunt you. Sleep in peace, my love, while others wake for 
 you. The time may come when victory will be granted to our 
 arms. Then we shall meet again, not aa now, like skulking 
 guilt, but in the open sight of day I shall present my son to his 
 loyal subjects. Now we part, my Eichard — again you are lost 
 to me, save in the recollection of this last farewell." 
 
 Her own words fell like a mournful augury on her ear. With 
 a look of agonized affectioa she opened her arms, and then

 enclosed in tlieir circle the stripling form of lier son. She 
 pressed him passionately to her heart, covering him with her 
 kisses, while the poor boy besought her not to weep ; yet, infected 
 by her sorrow, tears streamed froDi his eyes, and his little heart 
 swelled with insupportable emotion. It was at once a sight of 
 pity and of fear to behold his mother's grief. 
 
 Lady Brampton and Madeline now drew near, and this 
 effusion of sorrow passed away. The queen collected herself, 
 and rising, taking Hichard's hand in hers, with dignity and 
 grace she led him up to the fair Fleming, saying " A widowed 
 mother commits to your protection her beloved child. If heaven 
 favour our right, we may soon claim him, to fill the exalted 
 station to which he is heir. If disaster and death follow our 
 attempts, be kind to my orphan son, protect him from the 
 treachery of his enemies ; preserve, I beseech you, his young 
 
 Madeline replied in a tone that showed how deeply she 
 sympathized in the queen's sorrows, while she fervently pro- 
 mised never to desert her charge. " JS^ow depart," said Elizabeth ; 
 "leave me, Hichard, while I have yet courage to say adieu !" 
 
 Elizabeth stood watching, while the forms of the prince and 
 his protectress disappeared down the dark aisle. They reached 
 the door ; it swung back on its hinges, and the sound, made as 
 it closed again, reverberated through the arched cathedral. The 
 unfortunate mother did not speak ; leaning on her friend's arm 
 she quitted the church by another entrance. They returned to 
 the palace in silence ; and when again they conversed, it was 
 concerning their hopes of the future, the schemes to be devised ; 
 nor did the aching heart of Elizabeth reUeve itself in tears and 
 complaints, till the intelligence, received some weeks afterwards 
 of the safe arrival of the travellers in France, took the most 
 bitter sting from her fears, and allowed her again to breathe 
 freely.

 The birth of Arthur, prince of Wales, which took place in the 
 month of September of this same year, served to confirm Henry 
 Tudor ou the throne, and almost to obliterate the memory of a 
 second and resisting party in the kingdom. That party indeed 
 was overthrown, its chiefs scattered, its hopes few. Most of the 
 principal Yorkists had taken refuge in the court of the duchess 
 of Burgundy ; the earl of Lincoln only ventured to remain, 
 preserving the appearance of the greatest privacy, while his 
 secret hours were entirely occupied by planning a rising in the 
 kingdom, whose success would establish his cousin Richard duke 
 of York, the fugitive Perkiu TV;irbeck, on the throne. The 
 chief obstacle that presented itself was the difficulty of exciting 
 the English to any act of rebellion against the king, without 
 bringing forward the young prince as the principal actor on the 
 scene. The confirmed friendship between the queen and Lady 
 Brampton had produced a greater degree of intercourse between 
 the former and the earl ; but their joint counsels had yet failed 
 to originate a plan of action ; when chance, or rather the 
 unforeseen results of former events, determined their course of 
 action, and brought to a crisis sooner than they expected the 
 wavering purposes of each. 
 
 E/ichard Simon had quitted Winchester to fulfil his duties as 
 priest in the town of Oxford. No man was better fitted than 
 Simon to act a prominent part in a state-plot. He was brave ; 
 but the priestly garb having wrested the sword from his hand, 
 circumstances had converted that active courage, which might 
 have signahzed him in the field, to a spirit of restless intrigue ; 
 to boldness in encountering difficulties, and address in surmount- 
 ing them. To form plans, to concoct the various parts of a 
 scheme, wedging one into the other j to raise a whirlwind around

 him, and to kno^r, or to fancy that he knew, the direction the 
 ravao^er would take, and wliat would be destroyed and what 
 saved in its course, had been from youth the atmosphere in which 
 he lived. JSFow absent from the queen, he was yet on the alert 
 to further her views, and he looked forward to the exaltation of 
 her son to the throne as the foundation-stone of his own fortunes. 
 In what way could this be brought about ? After infinite deli- 
 beration with himself, Simon conceived the idea of brinoring 
 forward an impostor, who, taking the name of Eichard of York, 
 whose survival, though unattested, was a current belief in the 
 kingdom, might rouse England in his cause. If unsuccessful, 
 the safety of the rightful prince was not endangered ; if tri- 
 umphant, this counterfeit would dolf his mark at once, and the 
 real York come forward in his place. 
 
 In the true spirit of intrigue, in which Simon was an adept, 
 he resolved to mature his plans and commence his operations 
 before he communicated them to any. He looked round for a 
 likely actor for his new part, and chance brought him in contact 
 with Lambert Simnel, a baker's son at Oxford. There was 
 something in his fair complexion and regular soft features that 
 was akin to York ; his figure was slight, his untaught manners 
 replete with innate grace ; he was clever ; and his beauty having 
 made him a sort of favourite, he had grown indolent and assum- 
 ing. His father died about this time, and he was left a penniless 
 orphan. Simon came forward to protect him, and cautiously to 
 point out the road to fortune without labour. The youth proved 
 an apt scholar. To hear speak of princes, crowns, and kingdoms 
 as objects in which he was to have an interest and a share, 
 dazzled his young eyes. He learnt speedily every lesson the 
 priest taught him, and adopted so readily the new language 
 inculcated, that Simon became more and more enamoured of his 
 scheme, and sanguine as to its results. The next care of Simon 
 was to confirm, in the partizans of the House of York, the 
 suspicion they already entertained of the existence of its noblest 
 scion ; he despatched anonymous letters to the chief nobles, and 
 it became whispered through the country, though none knew the 
 origin of the tale, that the surviving son of Edward the Fourth 
 was about to appear to claim the crown. The peaceful sighed 
 to think that the AYhite and Hed Eoses would again be watered 
 by the best blood of England. The warlike and ambitious, the 
 partizans of Y^'ork, who had languished in obscurity, walked 
 more erect ; they regarded their disused armour with com- 
 placency, for war and tumult was then the favourite pastime of 
 high-born men. 
 
 It was at this period that, through the intervention of Lady 
 Brampton, Sir Thomas Broughtou, a most zealous Yorkist and

 chief friend of Lord Lovel, was introduced to tlie dowager queen's 
 presence, then residing in London. He came full of important 
 intelligence. He had been roused from his usnal repose by one 
 of Simon's anonymous letters, which hinted at the existence of 
 the duke of York, and counselled a drawing together of such 
 forces as would be willing to support him ; Lord Lovel was with 
 him, and at the name of E-ichard at once prepared for action. 
 He was busied in raising adherents in the south, sending Sir 
 Thomas to London, that he might there receive the commands 
 of the prince's mother. Scarcely had he entered the metropolis, 
 when in one of its narrowest alleys he was accosted by Richard 
 Simon, who had earnestly besought him to obtain an audience 
 for Simon himself from the queen ; acknowledging that he was 
 the author of the reports and commotions, and that he had 
 important secrets to disclose. 
 
 All this inspired the queen with the deepest disquietude. She 
 readily arranged with Sir Thomas the desired interview, which, 
 at Simon's request, was to take place that very night, and 
 agreed that he should enter the palace by a private door. Lady 
 Brampton giving him admittance. Broughton departed ; and 
 Elizabeth, disturbed and agitated, counted the hours impatiently 
 which must intervene before the riddle was explained. 
 
 Even this interval was full of wonder. A report was circulated, 
 which soon reached the palace, that the earl of Warwick, in 
 endeavouring to escape from the Tower in a boat, had fallen 
 into the river, and was drowned before assistance could be 
 afforded. Such was the current tale ; but many suspected that 
 the king was privy to a more guilty termination of his unhappy 
 prisoner, of whose death none entertained a doubt. This cir- 
 cumstance added to the queen's impatience — life was bound up 
 in the event of the next few hours. 
 
 The time arrived — all was quiet in the palace (the queen 
 inhabited Tower E-oyal) ; and the royal dowager and her friend 
 prepared for their visitor. At the signal given, the door was 
 opened ; but Simon came not alone ; the earl of Lincoln, Lord 
 Lovel, Sir Thomas Broughton, and an unknown youth — it was 
 Edmund Plantagenet — entered. The tale of the imposture of 
 Lambert Simnel was disclosed, and with it a change of plan, the 
 result of the death of Warwick. Simnel's age and appearance 
 accorded better with this prince than with his younger cousin. 
 It were easy to spread abroad that the report of his death was a 
 fiction contrived by the king ; that he had escaped, in fact, and 
 was in arms. If a more sinister fate had befallen him, guilt 
 would impose silence on his murderer ; if the attempt failed, no 
 evil would occur ; if successful, he would give instant place to 
 the superior claims of the duke of York.

 Lincoln unfolded tliese Bcliemes with sagacity and deliberation, 
 and the queen eagerly adopted his ideas as he disclosed them. It 
 was also tlie earl's suggestion that Simnel should first appear in 
 Ireland. The duke of Clarence had been lieutenant there, and 
 was much beloved throughout the island. Through neglect and 
 forgetfulness all the counsellors and officers appointed by Clarence 
 had been uuremoved by the new government, and might easily be 
 induced to favour his persecuted son. The duchess of Burgundy 
 was also to be applied to; and counsel was held as to who should 
 be informed of the truth — who deceived in this hazardous attempt. 
 I^ight wore away, while still the conspirators were in delibera- 
 tion ; they separated at last, each full of hope — each teeming 
 with gallant resolution. Henceforth the false smile or ill-con- 
 cealed frown of their enemy was indifferent to them ; tlieir good 
 swords were their sure allies ; the very victory gained by Henry 
 at Bosworth raised their expectations ; one other battle might 
 give them again all that then they lost.

 With the consciousness of this plot weighing on her mind, 
 Elizabeth Woodville continued her usual routine of life, and 
 made a part of the court of Henry the Seventh. She had long 
 been accustomed to pass from one evil to the other, and to find 
 that when one cause for unhappiness died away, it gave instant 
 place to another. She felt, with all the poignancy of a mother's 
 disappointed pride, the situation of her daughter. Neglect was 
 the lightest term that could be applied to the systematized and 
 cold-hearted tyranny of Henry towards his wife. For not only 
 he treated her like an unfavoured child, whose duty it was to 
 obey without a murmur, and to endeavour to please, though 
 sure of being repulsed. At the same time that he refused to

 raise lier above tbis state of degradation, lie reproached her with 
 the faults of maturity, and stung her womanly feelings with 
 studied barbarity. He taunted her with her attachment, to her 
 family and its partizans ; spoke with triumph of its overthrow; 
 and detailed with malignant pleasure every severe enactment 
 passed by himself against the vanquished Yorkists. Then, again, 
 he accused her of participating in her parent's intrigues ; and 
 though proud of the son she had given him, as the heir of his 
 crown, he divided, as much as possible, the infant from the 
 mother, under the avowed though ridiculous pretence of pre- 
 venting her from inculcating principles of rebellion towards his 
 lieije and father. 
 
 This last blow sunk deep. She had hitherto borne his harsh- 
 ness meekly, sustained by the hope of overcoming his flinty 
 nature by softness and yielding. She had anticipated that the 
 fresh enmity conceived against her on the event of Lord Lovel's 
 rebellion would be entirely allayed by her pretty Arthur, whose 
 birth was solemnized by many rejoicings. But when she found 
 this last hope fail, every expectation of good died away with it. 
 Among other acts of duty, she had for a long time pursued 
 a system of self-denial, deeming it a breach of duty to complain 
 of her husband, even to her mother. But this mother, acquainted 
 with the secrets of the human heart, and desirous of detaching 
 her entirely from her husband, exerted all the influence that one 
 experienced and firm can exercise over the young and vacil- 
 lating : she brought her to lament her situation, and to complain 
 of each fresh token of the king's disregard. The barrier of self- 
 restraint once broken through, the sympathy and remonstrances 
 of her parent emboldened her to such a change of conduct 
 towards Henr}'', as at first excited his surprise, then his con- 
 tempt. The many rumours afloat concerning the existence of 
 the duke of York served also to rouse his angry mood. If at 
 first he appeared somewhat complaisant towards his mother-in- 
 law, it was from an endeavour to put her off" her guard, and to 
 attract or surprise her confidence on the point which lay nearest 
 his heart ; but when he found that his attacks were vain, his 
 undisguised arrogance and her ill-concealed resentment produced 
 scenes, disgraceful in themselves, and agonizing to the wife and 
 daughter who was their witness. 
 
 At this moment, when suspicion was abroad — the Lancastrians 
 fearful, the Yorkists erect with renewed hopes — like the bursting 
 of a thunderstorm came the intelligence of the appearance of the 
 earl of Warwick in Dublin, his enthusiastic reception there, the 
 rising of the people in his favour, and the menaces held out by 
 him of his intention to wrench the sceptre of England from the 
 hand of him who held it.

48 THE BALTLE OF NEWAE^. 
 
 Henry alone heard tliese momentous tidings witli contempt. 
 The earl of Eildare, lord-lieutenant of tlie kingdom, had 
 received the pretender vrith princely honours ; j'et the very 
 circumstance of a false son of Clarence being supported by the 
 Yorkists "was the occasion of satisfaction to him ; his only fear 
 arose from the probable mystery covered by these designs. He 
 was angry at the disloyalty manifested ; but it was in a distant 
 province, and so came not home to him. There appeared no 
 falling off, no disturbance among his English subjects. Still 
 caution and policy were the weapons he best loved to wield ; 
 and he despatched several spies to Ireland, to endeavour to 
 fathom the extent and nature of the rebellion. The chief among 
 them was his own secretary, Frion, a Frenchman — a crafty and 
 experienced implement. He succeeded in bringing back irre- 
 fragable proof that the dowager queen mingled deeply in the 
 plot. 
 
 Henry hated Elizabeth "Woodville. He considered that it 
 was principally through her restless scheming that he had been 
 forced to marry the portionless (her detested claim to his crown 
 her only dower) daughter of York, instead of forming an union 
 with a foreign princess ; perhaps Mary of Burgundy, or Anne of 
 Britanny, either of whom would have brought gold to his coffers, 
 or extensive domains to his empire. He hated her, because he 
 deeply suspected that she was privy to the existence of a formi- 
 dable rival to his state. He /oieio that the young duke of York 
 had not died in the Tower. In every way she was his enemy ; 
 besides that linked to her ruin was the sweet idea of contisca- 
 tion, one ever entertained with delight by the money-loving 
 king. 
 
 He assembled a council in his palace at Shene, which stood 
 near where Eichmond now stands. The chiefs of the English 
 nobility were his counsellors. The duke of Buckingham, son of 
 hira who first favoured, and then rose against Hichard the Third. 
 The lords Dawbeny and Broke, who had been raised to tlie 
 peerage for their services in the same cause. Lord and Sir 
 William Stanley, men to whom Henry principally owed his 
 crown. Others there were of high rank and note ; but the king 
 paid most attention to two priests : John Morton, bishop of 
 Ely, and Richard Fox, bishop of Exeter, were his private advi- 
 sors and friends, as well as public counsellors. Morton had 
 watched over his interests while in exile ; he first had excited 
 the duke of Buckingham to revolt, and hatched the plot which 
 placed Richmond on the throne. 
 
 The council held was long and solemn, and the results brought 
 about more by insinuation than open argument, were different 
 from those expected by most of the persons present. First it

 was resolved tliat a general pardon sliould be proclaimed to tlie 
 insurgents. No exceptions were to be made ,• those persons then 
 in the very act of setting up his adversary were included ; for as, 
 by the second decree, that the real earl of Warwick should be 
 shown publicly in London, the deception would become mani- 
 fest ; if indeed they were deceived, it was thought more politic 
 to reclaim them by clemency, than by severe measures to drive 
 them to despair. 
 
 The third and last enactment was levelled against the queen 
 dowager. Many of the council were astonished to hear it pro- 
 posed, that she should forfeit all her goods and lands, and be 
 confined for life in a convent, for having consented to the mar- 
 riage of her daughter and Richard the Third, while the ready 
 acquiescence of the king and his chief advisers made them per- 
 ceive that this measure was no new resolve. These three decrees 
 passed, thecouncil separated, and Henryreturned to Westminster, 
 accompanied by Sir William Stanley. To him he spoke openly 
 of the treason of the queen : he even ventured to say, that he 
 was sure that some mystery lurked beneath ; he commissioned 
 Stanley, therefore, to notify the order of council to her majesty ; 
 but at the same time to show her, that disclosure, and reliance 
 on the king, would obtain her pardon. Sir William Stanley was 
 a courtier m the best sense of the term ; a man of gentle man- 
 ners ; desirous of doing right, easily excited to compassion, but 
 ambitious and timid ; one in truth" than whom none could be 
 more dangerous ; for his desire to please those immediately 
 before Lim.led him to assume every appearance of sincerity, and 
 perpetually to sacrifice the absent to the present. 
 
 Elizabeth heard, with utter dismay, the sentence passed against 
 her;— courage was restored only when she found that her free- 
 dom could be purchased by the confession of her son's existence, 
 and place of abode. She repelled Stanley's solicitations with dis- 
 dain; answered his entreaties with an appeal to his own feelings, 
 of how far, if such a secret existed, it were possible that she, a 
 mother, should intrust it to the false and cruel king. Stanley 
 speedily found his whole battery of persuasion exhausted; he 
 withdrew in some wonder as to what the real state of things 
 might be, and full of the deepest compassion. She had indeed 
 scarcely veiled the truth to him ; for, calling to mind the fate of 
 the wretched Margaret of Anjou,. she asked him, whether, like 
 her, she should expose the young orphan York to the fate of the 
 Lancastrian Prince Edward. But Stanley shrunk from being 
 privy to such disclosures, and hastily withdrew. 
 
 Henry had not exhausted all his hopes : glad as he was to 
 wreak his vengeance on the queen, and to secure her possessions 
 to himself, he was not so blind as not to see that the knowledge 
 
 E

 of lier secret were a fur greater prize. His next implement was 
 her eldest son, the marquess of Dorset. Lord Dorset had been 
 so active in his opposition to Sichard the Third, and had done 
 such ^ood service to his adversary, that Henry overlooked his 
 near kindred to the queen dowager, regarding him rather as the 
 representative of his father. Sir John Gray, who had fallen in 
 the cause of Lancaster. He became indeed a sort of favourite 
 with the king. Dorset was proud, self-sufficient, and extrava- 
 gant, but his manners were fascinating, his spirit buoyant, and 
 Henry, who was accustomed to find the storms of party lower- 
 ing like winter over his domestic circle, found relief only when 
 Dorset was present. The present occasion, however, called 
 forth other feelings in the haughty noble ; he might be angry 
 with his mother's plotting, but he was more indignant at the 
 severity exercised against her ; and far from furthering Henry's 
 designs, he applauded her resistance, and so irritated the king, 
 that it ended by his sudden arrest, and being committed to the 
 Tower. 
 
 And now all hope was at an end for the unhappy lady. The 
 various acts of her tragic history were to close in the obscurity 
 and poverty of a convent-prison. Fearful that her despair would 
 lead her to some deed that might at least disturb the quiet and 
 order he loved, Henry had resolved that no delay should have 
 place, but that on the very morrow she should be conveyed to 
 Bermondsey. She was to be torn from her family — her five young 
 daughters, with whom she resided. The heartless tyrant was 
 callous to every pang that he iofiicted, or rejoiced that he had 
 the power to wound so deeply one whom he abhorred. Lady 
 Brampton was with her to the last ; not to sustain and comfort 
 her ; the queen's courage and firmness was far greater than that 
 of her angry friend ; she pointed out the hope, that the cruelties 
 exercised towards her might animate the partisans of York to 
 greater ardour ; and tears forced themselves into her eyes only 
 when she pictured E-ichard, her victorious sovereign and sou, 
 hastening to unbar her prison doors to restore her to liberty and 
 rank. The night was spent in such discourses between the 
 ladies. With early dawn came the fated hour, the guard, the 
 necessity for instant departure. She disdained to show regret 
 before Henry's emissaries ; and with one word only to her friend 
 — "I commit kirn to your guidance," she yielded to her fate ; 
 submitting to be torn from all she loved, and, without an ex- 
 pressed murmur, entered the litter that bore her singly to her 
 living grave. 
 
 The same sun that rose upon the melancholy progress of Eliza- 
 beth Woodville towards Bermondsey, shone on a procession, 
 more gaudy in appearance, yet, if that were possible, more sad

 at heart. This was the visit, ordered by the kingf, of the earl of 
 Warwick to St. Paul's Cathedral; thus to contradict to the eyes 
 of all men the pretender in Ireland. Warwick had spent a year 
 in tlie Tower, in almost solitary imprisonment. Hopeless of 
 freedom, worn in health, dejected from the overthrow of all the 
 wild schemes he had nourished at Sherifi" Hutton, linked with 
 the love he bore his cousin, the Lady Elizabeth, now queen of 
 England, he could hardly be recognized as the same youth who 
 had been her companion during her residence there. He was 
 pale ; he had been wholly neglectful of his person ; carking sor- 
 row had traced lines on his young brow. At first he had con- 
 templated resisting the order of being led out as a show to 
 further his onemies' cause : one futile and vague hope, which 
 could only have sprung up in a lover's heart, made him concede 
 this point. Perhaps the court — the queen would be there. 
 
 He met several noble friends, commanded by Henry to attend 
 him ; for it was the king's policy to surround him with Yorkists, 
 so to prove that he was no counterfeit. Alas ! 
 
 '• These cloudy princes, and heart-sorrowing peers," 
 
 assembled like shadows in the dim abyss, mourning the splendour 
 of the day for ever set. They entered the cathedral, which 
 stood a heavy Grothic pile, on a grassy mound, removed from all 
 minor edifices. There was a vast assemblage of ladies and 
 knights ; all looked compassionately on this son of poor mur- 
 dered Clarence, the luckless flower, brought to bloom for an 
 hour, and then to be cast into perpetual darkness. The solemn 
 religious rites, the pealing organ, the grandeur of the church, 
 and chequered painted light thrown from the windows, for a 
 moment filled with almost childish delight the earl's young 
 heart ; that this scene, adapted to his rank, should be so single 
 and so transient, filled his soul with bitterness. Once or twice 
 he thought to appeal to his noble friends, to call on them to 
 resist the tyrant — Elizabeth's husband. His heart chilled at 
 the idea ; his natural timidity resumed its sway, and he was led 
 back to the prison-fortress, despairing, but unresisting. 
 
 Yet, at this hour, events were in progress which filled many 
 hearts with hope of such change as he would gladly hail. On 
 the news of the queen's arrest. Lord Lincoln had departed with 
 all speed to Flanders, to his aunt, the duchess of Burgundy, to 
 solicit her aid to attack and overcome the enemy of their van- 
 quished family. The Lady Margaret, sister of Edward the 
 Eourth of England, and wife of Charles the E-ash of Burgundy, 
 was a woman distinguished by her wisdom and her goodness.

 domains descended into the hands of his only child, a danghter 
 — and the false Louis the Eleventh of France, on one hand, and 
 the turbulent Flemings on the other, coalesced to rend in pieces, 
 and to prey upon, the orphan's inheritance — her mother-in-law, 
 the Lady Margaret, was her sage and intrepid counsellor ; and 
 when this young lady died, leaving two infant children as co- 
 heirs, the dowager duchess entirely loved, and tenderly brought 
 them up, attending to their affairs with maternal solicitude, and 
 governing the countries subject to them with wisdom and justice. 
 This lady was warmly attached to her family : to her the earl 
 of Lincoln and Lord Lovel resorted, revealing the state of things 
 — how her nephew, young Kichard, was concealed in poor 
 disguise in French Flanders, and how they had consented to 
 E-ichard Simon's plots, and hoped that their result would be to 
 restore her brother's son to the throne of their native land. 
 
 The duchess of Burgundy possessed a proud and high spirit. 
 The abasement in which her niece, the Lady Elizabeth, was held 
 by the earl of Eichmond ; she, the real giver of his crown, not 
 having herself been crowned ; the rigour exercised towards the 
 Yorkist chiefs, many of whom had been her defenders and 
 friends in time of flight and defeat ; the calumnies heaped on 
 the various members of her royal house ; made a prospect of 
 displanting Henry, and of revenge, grateful to her. She acceded 
 to the earl's request, gave him an aid of two thousand Germans, 
 led by Martin Swartz, a man of family and note in Germany, 
 providing them with vessels to take them to Ireland, and blessing 
 their expedition with her best and earnest wishes. 
 
 On their arrival in Dublin, a gay and brilliant scene was 
 acted, which raised the enthusiasm of the Irish, and spread a 
 glory round the impostor they supported. The exhibition of 
 the real earl of Warwick had produced no effect in Ireland ; 
 Thomas Geraldine, earl of Kildare, asserted that Henry had 
 brouiiht forward a counterfeit, and Lambert Simuel lost no 
 credit among them. He was proclaimed king of England ; he 
 was crowned by the bishop of Meath with a diadem taken from 
 an image of the Blessed Virgin ; a parliament was convoked in 
 his name, and every measure taken to insure his power in Ire- 
 land, and to gather together forces wherewith to invade the 
 sister island. 
 
 The English lords felt far more anxiety than their allies in the 
 K^sult of this insurrection. Although it had been disregarded 
 hy the Irish, the effect produced in England by the visit of 
 Warwick to St. Paul's was such as Henry had anticipated, and 
 the counterfeit in Ireland found few supporters among the 
 Yorkists. Still it was necessary to end as they had begun : to 
 acknowledge the imposture, so to bring forward the young son

 of Edward, would have been to all appearance too barefaced a 
 cheat. Lovel, as a gallant soldier, was ready to spend his blood 
 in any enterprise that promised to advance the White Rose ; 
 but he, as well as the earl of Lincoln, mingling sad memories 
 of the past with careful forethought, looked forward to the result 
 of Eichard Simon's contrivance with well-founded dread. Still 
 they entertained no thought of retreat, but mustered their forces, 
 and counselled with their associates for the furtherance of the 
 cause. On the 4th of June, Lambert Simnel, under the name 
 of Edward the Sixth, with his, so called, cousin De la Poole, 
 Lord Lovel, and their constant attendant young Edmund Plan- 
 tagenet, the Lords Thomas and Maurice Geraldine, with their 
 force of savage scarce-armed L'ish, and Martin Swartz, with his 
 German auxiliaries, landed at the pile of Foudray, in Lancashire, 
 where they were soon after joined by Sir Thomas Broughton, 
 who brought some few English to fight and die for this unhappy 
 conspiracy. 
 
 Henry was prepared for their arrival : to gain grace in his 
 subjects' eyes, he first made a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Wal- 
 singham, and then, proceeding to the midland counties, held 
 council to know whether it were best to encounter his foes out 
 of hand, or to let them drag on ; so to weary them by delay. 
 A number of nobles and their followers joined the king, and it 
 was agreed among them to press forward, before the enemy 
 should gather force in England. Henry had a further view in 
 this : he could not tell how far the secret of their plot, which he 
 felt assured was the design to advance the young son of Edward, 
 was divulged among the Yorkists, and how far believed ; as yet 
 the enterprise bore no ill guise for him, having at its head a 
 manifest impostor ; so he hastened onward to crush it utterly, 
 before it assumed a more fearful form. The earl of Lincoln, 
 eager to try the fortune of battle, advanced also on his side, and 
 the rival armies drew nigh each other at jSTewark-upon-Trent. 
 The king pitched his tents three miles beyond the town ; and on 
 the same night the earl encamped at Stoke, but a few miles dis- 
 tant. And now, after a reign of two years, as he had forced 
 Xing Hichard to fight for his crown against him, an adventurer 
 and an invader in his realm, did Henry Tudor find himself in 
 his adversary's position, about to risk life and kingdom on one 
 cast of the die against troops as ill-assorted but as desperate and 
 brave as his had been. Henry felt in his heart's core the 
 thrilling pang, which a conviction that all is in the hands of 
 fortune must ever impart to a human being who is her slave. 
 He felt that his crown was but an usurpation, that his anointed 
 and sacred head claimed no reverence from these enemies ; he 
 was degraded in his own eyes from being a sceptred king upheld

 by the laws, to a vrild adventurer, his f^ood sword his right ; a 
 fierce but disciplined auger filled his heart ; his brows were bent, 
 his voice was attuned to harshness, his thoughts were conversant 
 witli overthrow and death. The hour was come ; he was im- 
 patient for its passing, and he led forth his troops, all well- 
 appointed English soldiery, in such hope as the sight of a noble 
 army might well inspire, in such dread as was the natural 
 offs[)ring of the many chances and changes that had occurred to 
 the sovereigns of England during the late struggles. 
 
 The earl of Lincoln cherished still mightier fears ; yet there 
 was more of calm and dignity in his meditations than in the 
 impatient misgivings of Henry. His heart sickened at the idea 
 of battle and bloodshed : he felt himself responsible for the lives 
 of all : and, while this nerved his heart to courage, it took rest 
 from his eyes, and planted sorrow deep in his manly breast. 
 The morrow ! oh, the morrow ! hours full of fate ! whoso looks 
 forward and sees in the morrow the crown or ruin of the hopes 
 of many, may well pray the swift-pacing hours to lag, and 
 night to remain for ever as a spell to stop the birth of time. 
 
 Biit the morrow came ; a day of slaughter and captivity for 
 the Yorkist party. The battle was hard fought ; the German 
 auxiliaries were veteran soldiers, who spared neither blows nor 
 blood ; their leader, Martin Swartz, for valour, for streniith, 
 and for agility of body, was inferior to none among the warlike 
 captains of those times. The Irish, though half-naked and ill- 
 armed, fought with desperate bravery. In vain ; the valour 
 of Henry's soldiers was equal, their discipline and numbers 
 superior. First the noble Lincoln fell, and his comrades were 
 slaughtered around him, avenging his death. The Lords Geraldine, 
 Swartz, and Sir Thomas Broughton, were found among the 
 slain ; Lord Lovel was never heard of more ; the young Ed- 
 mund Plantagenet, struck in the side by a dart, lay for dead 
 upon the ground. Hichard Simon and his false-seeming pupil 
 were among the prisoners. 
 
 Such was the event of the last attempt of the Yorkists to 
 raise the bruised White E,ose to its old supremacy. All of high 
 rank and power that owned this symbol were gone ; Lincoln, 
 the best column of its fortunes, was destroyed ; nothing re- 
 mained, save the orphan prince, the royal exile, a boy of 
 thirteen years of age, brought up as the child of a Flemish 
 mone3^-lender. To hide himself in safe obscurity was his only 
 wisdom, till time should give strength to his arm, sagacity to 
 his plans, and power to his acts ; happy if he could ^find any 
 concealment sufficiently obscure, to baffle the discernment of 
 Henry, and to save him from the arts of those whom he would 
 employ to discover and seize on him.

 Henry ajrain felt himself secure on liis throne : lie deeply 
 lamented the death of Lincoln, as he had hoped to learn from 
 him the secret of the conspiracy. He found in Lambert Simnel 
 the mere tool of others, and in contempt made him a scullion 
 in his kitchen, so to throw derision on the -attempt whicli had 
 been made to exalt him. He dealt otherwise with Eichard 
 Simon. In the secrecy of his prison, every art was practised 
 to induce him to make a full confession. Simon played a 
 dastardly and a double part, half reveahng, half disguisiufj the 
 truth. Henry became assured that his rival, the duke of York, 
 survived, and he was led in some sort to guess at the place 
 of his abode. He had promised liberty to Simon when the 
 young prince should be in his hands ; meanwhile he was im- 
 prisoned in the monastery in vrhich he was fated to close his 
 existence.

 "Whoevee writes concerning the actions of the men of the 
 olden time, must sadden the reader by details of war, descrip- 
 tions of fields of battle, narrations of torture, imprisonment, 
 and death. But here also we find records of high virtues and 
 exalted deeds. It is at first sight strange that men whose 
 trade was murder, who habitually wore offensive weapons, whose 
 chief happiness was derived from the glory they acquired by 
 inflicting misery on others, should be among those who live 
 in our memories as examples of what is most graceful and 
 excellent in human nature. Too great security destroys the 
 spLnt of manhood, while the habit of hazardous enterprise 
 strengthens and exalts it. It was not because they destroyed 
 others, that the warriors of old y>eve famous for honour, courage,

 and fidelity ; bub because, from some motive springinir from 
 the unselfibb part of our nature, they exposed themselves to 
 danger aad to death. 
 
 It was at times such as these that friendship formed the chief 
 solace of man's life. The thought of his lady-love supported 
 the knight during his wanderings, and rewarded him on his 
 return ; but the society of his brothers in arms shortened the 
 weary hours, and made peril pleasure. Death, the severer of 
 hearts and destroyer of hope, is, in its actual visitation, the 
 great evil of life — the ineffaceable blot, the tarnisher of the 
 imagination's brightest hues ; but if he never came, but only 
 hovered, the anticipation of his advent might be looked upon 
 as the refiner of our nature. To go out under the shadow of 
 his dark banner, hand in hand, to encounter a thousand times 
 his grim likeness ; to travel on through unknown ways, during 
 starless nights, through forests beset with enemies, over moun- 
 tains, whose defiles hid him but to assure his aim ; to meet him 
 arrayed in his full panoply on the field of battle ; to separate 
 in danger ; to meet on the verge of annihilation ; and still, 
 through every change, to reap joy, because every peril was 
 mutual, every emotion shared, was a school for heroic friendship 
 that does not now exist. In those times, also, man was closer 
 linked with nature than now ; and the sublimity of her crea- 
 tions exalted his imagination, and elevated his enthusiasm — 
 dark woods, wild mountains, and the ocean's vast expanse, form 
 a stage on which, when we act our parts, we feel that mightiei? 
 natures than our own witness the scenes we present, and our 
 hearts are subdued by awe to resignation. 
 
 Edmund Plantagenet, the forest-bred son of Hichard the 
 Third, the late companion of the illustrious Lincoln and gallant 
 Lovel, lay long insensible on the field of battle, surrounded by 
 the dead — he awoke from his swoon to the consciousness that 
 they lay strewed around him dead, whom he had worshipped 
 as heroes, loved as friends. Life became a thankless boon ; 
 willingly w'ould he have closed his eyes, and bid his soul also 
 go on her journey to the unknown land, to which almost all 
 those to whom he had been linked during his past existence had 
 preceded him. He was rescued by a charitable friar from this 
 sad state — his wound was dressed — life, and with it liberty, 
 restored to him. After some reflection, the first use he resolved 
 to make of these gifts was to visit the young duke of York at 
 Tournay. 
 
 Edmund's mind, without being enterprising, was full of latent 
 energy, and contemplative enthusiasm. The love of virtue 
 reigned paramount in it ; nor could he conceive happiness un- 
 allied to some pursuit, whose origin was duty, whose aim was

THE DISCOVEET. 57 
 
 the good of others. His father, his ambition and his downfall, 
 were perpetual subjects for reflection ; to atone for the first and 
 redeem the last, in the person of his nephevr, became, in his 
 idea, the only fitting end of his life, Fostering this sentiment, 
 he speedily formed the determination of attaching himself to 
 the exiled "duke of York : first, to devote himself to the pre- 
 serving and educating him during childhood — and secondly, to 
 fight and die for him, when the time was ripe to assert his rights. 
 
 During his hazardous journey to Flanders, Edmund was sup- 
 ported by that glowing sensation which borrows the hues and 
 sometimes the name of happiness ; it was an ecstatic mood that 
 soared above the meaner cares of life, and exalted him by the 
 grandeur of his own ideas. Self-devotion is, while it can keep 
 true to itself, the best source of human enjoyment : there is 
 small alloy when we wholly banish our own wretched chnging 
 individuality, in our entire sacrifice at the worshipped shrine. 
 Edmund became aware of the value of his own life, as he 
 planned how in future he should be the guardian and protector 
 of his unfriended, peril-encircled orphan cousin. A religious 
 sentiment of filial love also influenced him ; for thus he could 
 in some sort repair the wrongs committed by his father. There 
 was much in Edmund's temperament that might have rendered 
 him a mere dreamer. The baser ends of common men possessed 
 no attractions for him ; but a lofty purpose developed the best 
 points of his character. 
 
 It was early dawn, when, a month after the battle of Stoke, 
 Plautagenet, in pursuance of his design, arrived at the cottage of 
 Madeline de Earo, where, under the lowly name of Perkin 
 Warbeck, dwelt the noble scion of the house of York. It was 
 a lovely spot — trees embowered the cot, roses bloomed in the 
 garden, and jessamine and woodbine were twined round the 
 porch. The morning breeze and rising sun filled the atmosphere 
 with sweets. Already the cottagers were enjoying its fragrance, 
 and Edmund, as he alighted, beheld the object of his journey — 
 the fair-haired stripling prince and his protectress Madeline. 
 Edmund was one-and-twenty, but his brow was more bent, 
 his eye more thoughtful, his cheek more pale and sunk 
 than befitted his age ; it was only when he smiled that 
 frankness displayed solemnity, and those who conversed with 
 him were ever eager to call forth those smiles, which, like sun- 
 beams that chase the shadows on a green hill-side, made darkness 
 light. Confidence readily springs up between the open-hearted 
 and good ; and Edmund and the inhabitants of the cottage found 
 no impediment to entire reliance on each other. Madeline was 
 overjoyed that her young charge should find manly guardianship 
 in his cousin, and mentioned how often her fears had been

 awatened on liis account, and how suspicions Lad got abroad 
 concerning him among the citizens of Tournay. 
 
 MadeHne, the sister of the Fleming, John Warbeck, was mar- 
 ried to a Spaniard in the service of PortugaL In those days, 
 just p'reyious to the discovery of America by Columbus, while 
 that illustrious man was offering his unesteemed services at 
 Lisbon, the Portuguese were full of the spirit of enterprise and 
 maritime adventure. Each year new yessels were sent south- 
 ward along the unexplored shores of Africa, to discover beyond 
 the torrid zone a route to India. Hernan de Faro was a mariner 
 — it was during one of his yoyages to Holland that he had seen 
 and married Madeline, and he left her in her native country, 
 while he pursued his fortunes down the Golden Coast as iar as 
 the Cape of Good Hope. He had been absent longer than she 
 had anticipated, and each day might bring the wanderer back, 
 when he purposed taking her with him to his native Spain. 
 What, then, must become of Eichard ? Plantagenet saw at 
 once the necessity of visiting the court of Burgundy, and of 
 placing her nephew at the disposition of the Duchess Margaret. 
 
 The young prince was now fourteen — he had shot up in height 
 beyond his years, beautiful in his boyhood, and of greater promise 
 for the future. His clear blue laughing eyes — his clustering 
 auburn hair — his cheeks, whose rosy hue contrasted with the 
 milk-white of his brow — his tall and slender but agile person, 
 would have introduced him to notice among a crowd of strangers. 
 
 His very youthful yoice was attuned to sweetness. If Edmund 
 found the Lady Margaret lukewarm, he need only lead the noble 
 boy into her presence to interest her in his favour. Eichard 
 heard with tearful eyes of the imprisonment of his mother, and 
 the slaughter of his kinsmen and friends. His heart for the 
 moment desired yengeance ; he would himself seek his aunt of 
 Burgundy, and aided by her, attack the usurper. With difficulty 
 he permitted his cousin to depart alone ; but he was obliged to 
 yield, and Plantagenet set out for Brussels, promising a speedy 
 return. 
 
 About a week after Edmund's departure, another yisitor 
 arrived at the cottage of the exile. A violent storm had over- 
 taken Duke Eichard and his constant companion, Madeline's 
 daughter, in one of their wanderings in the fields near Tournay. 
 As they stood for shelter under a half-ruined building, a traveller 
 came to share the asylum. He was a Frenchman — a Provencal 
 by his accent ; for he immediately entered into conversation with 
 them. As he is a man spoken of in the Chronicles, he shall 
 receive his name at once ; this apparently chance-traveller was 
 Frion, Stephen Frion, King Henry's secretary. He had been 
 employed to search out the young prince by such tokens as

THE DISCOVEEY. 59 
 
 Ki chard Simon had given, and chance had caused him to fall in 
 with Edmund, whom he had before remarked in attendance on 
 the earl of Lincoln. Easily guessing that Edmund's jouruey 
 might have connection with his own, he tracked him toTournay, 
 and then by some untoward chance lost sight of him. The inde- 
 fatigable spy had spent the last week in a particular survey of 
 every spot round the town and in the neighbouring cities, to 
 discover his lost clue. Overtaken by a storm on his return from 
 Lisle, he suddenly found himself under a shed with a youth 
 whose appearance at once excited his strongest curiosity. 
 
 What Frion loved beyond all other things was power and 
 craft. He had been a subject of the poetical King Rene of Pro- 
 vence ; but, despatched on some occasion to Louis the Eleventh, 
 he entered into the service of that monarch, whose subtlety and 
 faithlessness were a school of wisdom to this man. On one sub- 
 ject did he love to dwell — the contrast between Charles of Bur- 
 gundy and Louis of Erance ; the first commencing his reign by 
 combating and vanquishing the latter, and dying miserably at 
 last by a traitor's hand, his armies cut to pieces, his domains the 
 unresisting prey of his rival ; while Louis, by serpent ways, by 
 words — not deeds — gained every point, won every follower, and 
 established his rule at last over the greater part of the wide 
 territories of the fallen duke. In a minor way Frion aimed at 
 imitating Louis ; but he was naturally more fiery and rash. He 
 had visited Italy also, and studied there the wiles and cruelties 
 of the Italian lords ; crossing back to Marseilles, he had been 
 seized by corsairs and carried to Africa : — here he put in practice 
 some of his lessons, and contrived to make himself a favourite 
 with his Mahometan master, who afterwards crossed to Spain to 
 serve under the Moorish king of Granada. Frion was quickly 
 distinguished for his sagacity in the divided counsels of this dis- 
 tracted kingdom, and became the trusty adviser of him called 
 Boabdil el Chico. When this unfortunate sovereign was taken 
 prisoner by the Spaniards, Frion was a chief mediator between 
 them and the Sultana Ayza. At the court of Ferdinand and 
 Isabella he met several Frenchmen, who awakened in his heart 
 a keen desire to revisit his native country. He took advantage 
 of an embassy thither from the court of Spain, to fulfil his wishes, 
 but arrived at Plessis only in time to witness Louis' death. Two 
 years afterwards he was found in the train of the earl of Eieh- 
 mond — the future secretary, spy, and favourite of Henry the 
 Seventh — now travelling by his order to find, seize, or destroy, 
 the last blossom of the uprooted White Eose. 
 
 Frion was rather handsome in appearance, with bright black 
 eyes and dark hair, a complexion embrowned by the sun, a look 
 of gaiety — unless when controlled by the will of a superior, he

 was alvrays iaughing — a quiet kind of sarcastic laugh ; he looked 
 not the man Csesar would have feared, except that his person 
 was rather inclined to leanness ; but he was active and well versed 
 in martial exercises, though better in clerkly accomplishments. 
 His early youth had been chiefly employed in copying poetry 
 for King liene — he wrote beautifully, and his small white hands 
 were the objects of his own very great admiration. Such was 
 his outward look ; he had stores of science and knowledge within, 
 which he seldom displayed, or, when necessary, let appear with 
 all the modesty of one who deemed such acquirements were of 
 little worth — useful sometimes, but fitter for a servitor than his 
 lord. No words could describe his wiliness, his power of being 
 all things to all men, his flattery, his knowledge of human 
 nature, his unparalleled artifice, which, if it could be described, 
 would not have been the perfect thing it was : it was not silken, 
 it was not glossy, but it wound its way unerringly. Could it fail 
 — the rage and vengeance to follow were as certain as dire, for, 
 next to love of power, vanity ruled this man ; all he did was 
 right and good, other pursuits contemptible and useless. 
 
 Such was the serpent-spirited man who contrived to partake 
 Eichard's shelter ; he eyed him keenly, he addressed him, and 
 the prince replied to his questions about an asylum for the night, 
 by a courteous invitation to his home. " The boy speaks not 
 like a cotter : his eye beams with nobleness. What a freak of 
 nature, to make one in appearance a king's son, the plodding 
 oifspring of a rude Fleming 1 " As these thoughts passed through 
 Prion's mind, the truth came not across him ; and he even hesi- 
 tated for a moment whether he should not, now the storm had 
 passed, pursue his way : but his garments were wet, the ways 
 miry, night at hand. At a second thought he accepted the invi- 
 tation, and leading his horse, he accompanied the youthful pair 
 to their cottage home. 
 
 Madeline, unsuspicious of one obviously a Frenchman, 
 received him without fear, and after a fire had dried the visitor's 
 dress, they sat down to a frugal supper. Frion, according to his 
 usual manner, strove to please his hosts. His gay discourse, 
 the laughable, yet interesting accounts he gave of various 
 adventures that had befallen him, made all three — the fair 
 Madeline the ardent princely boy, and the dark-eyed daughter 
 of de Faro — sit in chained attention. When he heard that 
 Madeline was united to a Spaniard, he spoke of Spain, of 
 Granada and the Moorish wars ; Hichard's eyes flashed, and the 
 dark orbs of the girl dilated with wonder and delight. 
 
 At length he spoke of England, and his words implied that 
 he had lately come thence. "How fares the poor island?"

THE DISCOVEEY. 61 
 
 asked the youth ; " such stories of its tyrant reach us here, that 
 methinks its fields must be barren, its people few." 
 
 "Had you been my comrade, younoj master, through merry 
 Kent," said Frion, "you would speak in another strain. Plenty 
 and comfort, thanks to King Harry and the Red Eose, flourish 
 there. The earth is rich in corn, the green fields peopled with 
 fat kine, such as delight yon islanders. ' Give an Englishman 
 beef and mustard,' says our French proverb, 'and he is happy;' 
 they will find dearth of neither, while the sage Henry lives, and 
 is victorious." 
 
 "Yet we are told here," cried the youth, "that this Welsh 
 earl, whom you call king, grinds the poor people he has van- 
 quished to the dust, making them lament him they named Crook- 
 back, who, though an usurper, was a munificent sovereign." 
 
 These words from a Fleming or a Frenchman sounded strange 
 to Frion ; the doubt, which he wondered had not before pre- 
 sented itself, now came full-fledged, and changed at its birth to 
 certainty; yet, as the angler plays with the hooked fish, he 
 replied, "I, a stranger in the land, saw its fair broad fields, and 
 thought their cultivators prosperous ; I heard that the king was 
 victorious over his foes, and deemed his subjects happy. Yet, I 
 bethink me, murmurs were abroad, of taxes and impositions. 
 They spoke, with regret, of the White Eose, and scowled when 
 they said that Elizabeth of York was rather a handmaiden in 
 her husband's palace, than queen of fertile England." 
 
 " iS^ow, were I an English knight, with golden spurs," said 
 the stripling, " I would challenge to mortal combat that recreant 
 Tudor, and force him to raise fair Elizabeth to her fitting 
 elevation : woe the while, all England's good knights are slain, 
 and the noble Lincoln, the last and best of all, has perished ! " 
 
 " You speak unwisely and unknowingly, of things you wot 
 not of," said Madeline, alarmed at the meaning glance of Frion ; 
 " good nephew Perkin, your eyes see not even the English 
 white cliffs, much less can your mind understand its dangerous 
 policy." 
 
 " Nay, dear mother," remarked her little daughter, "you have 
 told me that the noble earl and the good Lord Lovel had been 
 kind guardians to my cousin Peterkin : you chid him not when 
 he wept their death, and you may suffer him to reproach their 
 foe." 
 
 " I know nothing of these lords," said Frion, " whose names 
 are a stumbling-block to a Frenchman's tongue. But methinks 
 it is well for us that they aim at each other's hearts, and make 
 booty of their own provender, no longer desolating the gay 
 fields of France with their iron hoofs."

 And no"!r, since that he bad found him "whom he sou.oht, 
 Frion talked again of other matters, and. as before, his smooth 
 and f^ay discourse gained him pleased auditors. At length, the 
 peaceful cottagers retired to rest, and Frion sunk to sleep under 
 their hospitable roof, after he had thought of various plans by 
 which he might possess himself of the prince's person ; — the 
 readiest and safest way was to entice him to accompany him 
 alone some little space, no matter how short: he trusted to his 
 own skill to draw him still further and further on, till he should 
 be put on board the boat that would ferry him to his own 
 revolted England. 
 
 CHAPTER IX. 
 
 THE DECOY. 
 
 Gilderoy was a bonnie boy, 
 
 Had roses tull his shoone; 
 His stockings were of silken soy, 
 
 With garters hanging doon. 
 
 Old Ballad. 
 
 It was a simple scheme, yet with the simple simplicity succeeds 
 best. A new face and talk of distant lands had excited York 
 beyond his wont. He could not rest during the long night, 
 while the image of his disastrous fortunes haunted him like a 
 ghost. " Were I the son of a falconer or hind," he thought, *' I 
 could don my breastplate, seize my good cross-bow, and away 
 to the fight. Mewed up here with women, the very heart of a 
 Plantagenet will fail, and I shall play the girl at the sight of 
 blood. Wherefore tarries Sir Edmund, our gentle coz ? If he 
 be a true man, he shall lead me to danger and glory, and 
 Eniiland, ere she own her king, shall be proud of her outcast 
 child." 
 
 To a mind thus tempered — heated like iron in a smith's forge 
 — Frion, on the morrow, played the crafty artisan, fashioning it 
 to his will. He and the prince rose early, and the secretary 
 prepared for immediate departure. As he hastily partook of a 
 slight repast, he renewed the conversation of the preceding 
 night, and like the Sultaness Scheherezade (perhaps he had 
 heard of her device among the Moors), he got into the midst of

 the quarrels of El Zagal and El Chico, the kings of Granada, at 
 the moment it \A'as necessary for him to hasten away—" Good 
 youth," said he, " I play the idle prater, w hile mine errand waits 
 for me — lead me to the stable, and help me to saddle my nag ; if 
 you will serve me as a guide to Lisle, you will do a good deed, 
 and I will reward it by finishing the strange history of the 
 Moorish kings." 
 
 The horse was quickly in order for departure. " I will but 
 say good day to ray kinswoman, and go with you," said Eichard. 
 
 •'That were idle," replied the secretary, " the sun has hardly 
 peeped out from his eastern window, and dame Madeline and 
 her dark-eyed daughter sleep ; we kept them waking yester- 
 night ; they will scarce have risen ere you return." 
 
 The duke suffered himself to be persuaded — with his hand on 
 the neck of the horse, he strode beside his tempter, listening to 
 his cunning tales of Moorish ferocity and Christian valour. The 
 walls of Lisle at length appeared — " Here we part," said the 
 duke, who remembered the caution given him, never to enter 
 these border towns, where the English nobles often resided for a 
 space, and the appearance of the gallant stripling, and his close 
 resemblance to other members of the princely house of York, 
 might beget suspicion and danger. 
 
 *' Wherefore this haste. Sir Perkin ? " saidFrion ; "cooped up 
 under a thatched roof from Lent to Shrovetide, methinks you 
 should be glad to stretch your chain. I remain brief space in 
 yonder walls ; leave me not till I depart." 
 
 " Who told you I was cooped up ? " said the prince, hastily ; 
 " if I am chained, the key of my fetters is in my own hand." 
 
 " Put it swiftly in the wards then, and cast away the heavy 
 iron ; come on with me, to where thou shalt ruffle bravely with 
 satin-coated squires." 
 
 Erion judged his prize already won, and almost threw aside 
 his usual caution. Eichard liked not the -expression his sharp 
 black eye assumed, nor the wrinkling of his brow ; he began to 
 wonder what there had been in this man so to allure him into 
 friendly converse ; now that in a familiar tone he invited him to 
 continue his companion, his haughty spirit revolted. " Good sir," 
 said he, " I now have done a host's duty by you. I saved you 
 from a storm, restored you to your road — yonder path, shaded 
 by poplars, leads at once to the town's gate — farewell ! " 
 
 " I am but an unmeet comrade for you, gay gentleman," said 
 Erion ; "pardon me if I have said aught unfitting the cottager 
 of Tournay to hear. I now go to the noble kniglit, tlie Sire de 
 Beverem, and I would fain have shown him what striplings these 
 swamps breed ; methought his gilt palace were fitter dwelling 
 than yonder hut for one, who, if his face lie not, aspires to nobler

 acts than weeding a garden or opening a drain. Come, my lord, 
 — how tript my tongue ? but your eye is so lordly that the word 
 came of itself — gentle youth, trust yourself with one, who loves 
 to see the fiery youngster amid his mates, the gallant boy looked 
 on with love and favour by the noble and valiant." 
 
 Prudence whispered to Richard that this was dangerous sport; 
 pride told him that it were unfit, nameless, and ushered thus, to 
 appear before the high-born ; but thoughtless youth urged him 
 on, and even as Frion spoke, at a quick pace they approached 
 the town-gate. The Sire de Beverem too, whom the wily French- 
 man named, had been favoured by Edward the Fourth, and was 
 his guest in London — " Let the worst come, and it were well to 
 have made such a friend. I will bear myself gallantly," thought 
 York, " and win the good knight's smile ; it may profit me here- 
 after. Now I shall see how the world goes, and if any new 
 device or fashion have sprung up among our chivalry, that I may 
 seem not quite untauo^ht when I lead the sons of my father's 
 friends to the field. Be it as you please," he said to his seducer, 
 " before now my hand has grasped a foil, and I will not shame 
 your introduction." 
 
 Frion went forward conning his part ; he felt that his task was 
 not so easy as he had imagined : the boy was wild as a bird, and 
 so gave in to the lure ; but, like a bird, he might away without 
 warning, and speed back to his nest ere his wings were well 
 limed. It was many miles to the coast : Frion's resolution had 
 been hastily formed. The Lord Fitzwater, a partisan of Henry, 
 ■was then sojourning at Lisle. He had been to Brussels, and on 
 his return towards Calais a sickness had seized hira, which forced 
 him to remain some weeks under the roof of the Sire de Beverem ; 
 he was recovering now, and on the eve of his departure ; without 
 confiding the whole secret to him, the papers and tokens Frion 
 bore must vouch that the king would thank any of his lieges who 
 should aid him in bringing by force or decoy a pretended son of 
 the traitor earl of Lincoln (for thus Frion resolved to name his 
 victim) to the English shores. 
 
 Yet the decoy er had a difficult part to play ; there was a 
 quickness in the prince's manner which made him fear that, if 
 his intentions changed, his acts would not lag behind ; and 
 though he did not betray suspicion, he was so perfectly alive to 
 everything said and done, that any circumstance of doubt would 
 not fail immediately to strike him. Although they had hitherto 
 discoursed in French, yet it was certain that his native English 
 had not been forgotten by him ; nay, the appearance of the Lord 
 Fitzwater's attendants, their livery, their speech, must awaken 
 the prince's fears, and confound the wiles of his enemy. Frion 
 pondered on. all these obstaeles, as he rode gently through the

THE DECOY. 65 
 
 narrow streets of Lisle ; at length they reached the abode of the 
 French noble, and here Frion halted ; while the duke, beginning 
 to be ill-satisfied with the part he played, and his promised pre- 
 sentation by such a roan, almost resolved to break from him here 
 and to return ; shame of appearing feeble of purpose alone pre- 
 vented him. At last, passing through the court-yard up a dark and 
 massy staircase, he found himself in a hall, where several men 
 at arms were assembled, some furbishing pieces of armour, others 
 engaged in talk, one or two stretched along the benches asleep : 
 pride awoke in the youth's breast, he had gone too far to retrace 
 his steps, and he resolved to bear himself gallantly towards the 
 noble to whom he was about to be presented : yet, pausing for a 
 moment, " My memory," he thought, " leads me far a-field, or 
 some of these men bear English badges, and their wearers seem 
 grey-eyed Englishmen." Frion meanwhile, selecting with quick 
 tact one of the followers of the Sire de Beverem who chanced 
 to be among these men, requested an instant introduction to 
 Lord Fitz water, using such golden arguments that the man, half 
 afraid of being called on to divide the spoil, motioned him 
 quickly to follow, and, passing through a suite of rooms, as he 
 approached the last, he said, " He is there, I will call his page." 
 " It needs not," said Frion ; " await me here, Sir Perkin," and 
 pushing forward, to the astonishment of the attendant, entered 
 unannounced to the baron's presence : Kichard thought he heard 
 a "By St. Thomas ! " uttered as the door closed hastily; but 
 some Englishman might be with the French noble, and though 
 a momentary wonder crossed him, no doubt of Frion's integrity 
 was awakened. 
 
 "By Saint Thomas!" exclaimed Lord Fitzwater, as Frion 
 almost burst into his apartment, " what rude varlet is this ? 
 Are serfs so used to enter a baron's chamber in France ?" 
 
 " Most noble sir," said Frion, "if in three words, or, if you 
 refuse me these, if in one eye-glance, I do not satisfy you, bid 
 your men beat me with staves from the door. I am here in 
 Xing Henry's service." 
 
 " God save him ! " said the noble, " and you, sir knave, from 
 the fate you name, which will be yours undoubtedly, if you do 
 not give me good reason for your ill-mannered intrusion." 
 
 Frion looked round. Except the baron there was no one in 
 the room, save a stripling of about sixteen years. The lad, 
 though short in stature, was handsome ; yet there was a look 
 that indicated the early development of qualities, which, even 
 in manhood, detract from beauty. He seemed conversant in the 
 world's least holy ways, vain, reckless, and selfish ; yet the 
 coarser lines drawn by self-indulgence and youthful sensuality,

 "were redeemed in part by the merry twinkling of his eye, and 
 the ready laugh that played upon his lips. " My words are for 
 your ears alone, my lord," said Frion, " and be assured they 
 touch your liege nearly." 
 
 " Go, Bobert," said Fitzwater, " but not further than the 
 ante-chamber." 
 
 "There is one there," said Frion, anxiously: "he must not 
 quit it — he must not escape, nor learn in whose hands he is." 
 
 "Your riddles, sir, ill please me," replied the noble. 
 
 " Look at this paper, my lord, and let it Touch for the heavy 
 import of my business." 
 
 Lord Fitzwater recognized his royal master's signatiire, and 
 with an altered tone he said, " Leave us, Eobert ; tarry not in 
 the ante-chamber, but bear my greeting to my noble host, and 
 ask him, when I may, at his best leisure, pay my thanks to him 
 and my kind lady. I depart to-morrow at dawn j and mark, 
 speak not to the stranger who waits without." 
 
 The youth made obeisance, and departed. Apiece of tapestry 
 hung before the door, which, together with the massy boards 
 themselves, prevented any sound from piercing to the other side; 
 the lad was about to proceed on his errand, when curiosity 
 prompted him to look on the stranger, with whom he was com- 
 manded not to parley. Eichard stood in the embrasure of one 
 of the windows, but turned quickly as the folding-door shut with 
 no gentle sound ; his candid brow, his bright blue eyes, his 
 frank-hearted smile, who that had ever seen could forget them ? 
 nor were the traits of the other's countenance less marked, 
 though less attractive. The words burst at the same instant 
 from either—" My Lord of York ! " " Gentle Eobin Clifford." 
 
 " My prison play-fellow," cried the prince ; " this for me is a 
 dangerous recognition. I pray you be wise, and — as you were 
 ever^kind, and keep my secret close." 
 
 " Alas ! my lord," said E.obert, "you have opened your hand, 
 and let the winged fool fly unwittingly, if you think it has not 
 been discovered by yonder false loon. Know you where you 
 are?" 
 
 " Then I am betrayed ! I see it, feel it. Farewell, Hobin, 
 my fleet legs will outrun their slow pursuit." 
 
 " Nay, an' that were possible," said Clifford ; " but it is not ; 
 let me better advise your highness ; trust me you shall be free ; 
 but hark, they come ; I must not be found here. Show no 
 suspicion ; yield to your fate as if jou knew it not, and conlide 
 in me ; my hand on it, this night you are at liberty." 
 
 Clifford quitted the apartment by the opposite door, while 
 Frion entered from the other, beckoning the duke to approach.

 He took him by the Land, and led him to Lord Fitz water, who 
 started back when he saw him, and was about to exclaim ; but 
 Frion, in French, addressino^ him as the Sire de Beverem, 
 entreated his kind favour for Perkin "Warbeck, the gallant youth 
 before him. The baron evidently was ill-pleased at the part he 
 had consented to play; he said a few words with an ill grace, 
 and bidding Perkin welcome, promised him favour, and permis- 
 sion for the present to remain in his abode. Eichard saw 
 through the flimsy disguise which the Englishman threw over 
 his native speech, though he did not know who his receiver was; 
 but, feeling that it was best to follow his young friend's counsel, 
 he replied, also in French, that, at his guide's invitation, he had 
 eagerly sought an interview with the renowned Sire de Beverem; 
 that the honour done him would be deeply engraven in his heart; 
 that on some future occasion he would gratefully avail himself 
 of Ids offers; but, at the present time, he had left his home 
 without intimating any intention, of a prolonged absence, and 
 that he owed it to a kind kinswoman, not to disquiet her by 
 delaying his return. He prayed the noble to dismiss him there- 
 fore, craving leave only to attend him some other day. 
 
 " Be it so," said Fitzwater ; " to-morrow at dawn you shall 
 depart hence ; but you must not refuse my proffered hospitality. 
 I shall introduce you to my household as one who ere long will 
 be admitted into it, and show my friend. Sir Lalayne, who is 
 now here, what gentle boors our Flanders breeds." 
 
 "I can return to-morrow, my good lord," Eichard began ; but 
 the noble not heeding him, added, " Stay till my return ; I now 
 go to hear mass," and passed hastily from the chamber. 
 
 The prince's first impulse was to reproach Frion's knavery, 
 assert his freedom, and, ere any measures had been taken to 
 secure his person, to quit his new prison. But he did not know 
 how deep-laid the plot might be ; he was inclined to think that 
 all was prepared for his reception and safe custody, so that any 
 open attempt to regain his liberty would be resisted by force ; 
 while, through the assistance of his friend Clifford, he might hope 
 to escape, if, giving in to the stratagem, he took occasion by the 
 curb, and forced it to his purpose. " Are you mad," said Frion, 
 *' my rustic, that you resist the proffers of a high and powerful 
 man of your native land ?" 
 
 Eichard wondered, when he beheld Frion's sneer and crafty 
 glance, how he had not mistrusted him from the moment he 
 beheld him ; the double meaning of his words, and the familiar 
 tone in which they were uttered, grated him like a personal 
 insult. He repressed the angry reply rising to his lips, and 
 said, " It seems I must submit, yet I should be beholden to you 
 
 F 2

68 THE DECOY. 
 
 if you contrived an excuse, and lent me your horse, tliat I might 
 ride back and inform Dame Madeline. To-morrow- I might 
 return." 
 
 Frioii opposed this intention, and led the prince to a chamber 
 at some distance from any other, at the end of a corridor, saying, 
 ** that it had been assijrned to him ;" and after a short conversa- 
 tion left him. Richard heard the shooting of the bolt as the 
 door closed ; " Son of Eing Edward," he thought, " thy folly 
 disgraces thy parentage ; thus at once to have run into the gin. 
 Yet I am of good cheer, and my heart tells me that I shall 
 relate the merry tale of my escape to Madeline and my sweet 
 coz, and dry this night the tears my disappearance has caused 
 them to shed." It soon appeared, by the long absence of his 
 betrayer, that it was not intended to continue the farce longer ; 
 but that, from the moment he had entered that chamber, he was 
 in treatment as well as in fact a prisoner. After several weary 
 hours had elapsed, his blithe spirit began to sink ; he reflected 
 that Clifford had probably promised more than he could perform ; 
 but courage awoke with the sense of danger ; he resolved to bo 
 true to himself, and to effect his escape singly, if he could gain 
 no assistance. " Men have ears and hearts," he thought, " and 
 I can work on these ; or they may be neglectful while I am on 
 the alert, and I can profit by their carelessness. In all forms 
 my fortune may take, I will not fail to myself; and there is 
 small danger in any change for a true man. With my light 
 spirit and resolved will, I could, I doubt not, persuade an armed 
 band to make way for me, or open prison bolts with charming 
 words, though my witchcraft be only that of gentle courtesy, 
 moulding with skilful hand the wax of soft humanity." Pacing 
 the apartment, he continued these meditations, imagining every 
 circumstance that might and would arise, and how he was to 
 turn all to the best advantage. He framed persuasive speeches, 
 wily answers to ensnaring questions, cautious movements, by 
 which he might withdraw himself from the hands of his enemies; 
 and while he thus occupied himself, his eyes gleamed, and his 
 cheeks glowed, as if the moment of action had come, and his 
 life and libert}^ depended on instant deed. 
 
 At two hours past noon the door was unclosed, and a servant 
 entered bearing food ; impatient to begin his plans of escape, 
 Richard was about to speak to him, when, in the doorway, he 
 beheld the slight, stunted figure of Clifford, whose forefinger 
 was pressed on his lips, and who, after exchanging one glance 
 with his friend, cast aside his stealthy expression of countenance, 
 entering with a half-swaggering look, and saying, in French, 
 *• My lord, young sir, has sent me on a pleasant embassage,

 even that of dining \ritli your pagesLip, say in f^, two boys like 
 us were better and merrier tofrether, than in the great hall v.ith 
 the arrogant serving-men." Eichard felt no great appetite ; but 
 taking the tone from his friend, he thanked him, and they fell to 
 on the viands. " Now, kind Thomas," said Clifford, " of your 
 bounty bring us a stoup of wine ; the day is rainy, and we cannot 
 abroad ; so ray gossip and I will tell long stories over our bottle, 
 and lay some plan of merry mischief which you and your fellows 
 may in good time rue." 
 
 The domestic obeyed ; nor till the wine was brought, tlie 
 servant fairly dismissed, and the door closed, did Clifford put 
 aside the character he had assumed of a striplmg page, in a 
 noble master's abode, entertaining a stranger visitant of his own 
 years. At length, when they were quite alone, the merry boy 
 put his hands to his sides and indulged in so gay a peal of 
 laughter, that the prince, who at first stared in wonder, at last 
 caught the infection, and laughed too, while tears from super- 
 abundant glee streamed down their cheeks. Once, twice, and 
 thrice did llichard check himself, and turn seriously to inquire 
 the cause of this merriment ; and Clifford strove to answer ; but 
 laughter bubbling up choked his voice, and both again yielded 
 in accord to the overpowering fit. At last gasping, holding their 
 sides, and by degrees commanding their muscles, the duke said, 
 " I would ask you, friend Eobin, what this means H But at the 
 word, lo you ! your very voice is lost. Now, prithee, feel half 
 as weary as I do of this folly, and you will be as grave as tumble- 
 down Dick. Do you remember the simpering fellow we made 
 good sport of in the Tower? " 
 
 " You have broken the spell, my lord," said Clifford; "that 
 word suffices to make me as grave as Brakenbury himself, when 
 he looked on your brother's corpse. Ah dear, your highness, the 
 name of the Tower is worse than a raven's croak ! God and 
 St. Thomas preserve you from ever getting the other side of its 
 moat ! " 
 
 " Amen, Eobin, with all my heart," said Eichard ; '* a shudder 
 runs through my limbs down to my finger tips, making the skin 
 on my head creep, when I think there is any chance of my 
 passing long years in those dreary cells, with their narrow deep 
 windows ; the court-yards, which the sun seldom visits ; the 
 massy dark walls, whose black stones seemed to frown angrily 
 if our childs' voices were ever heard in sport." 
 
 " There your cousin, my lord of "Warwick, pines out his 
 melancholy days," replied Clifford; "and that is your destined 
 abode. J\ly grandfather was slain by Queen Margaret's side, 
 and stained the Eed Eose with a blood-red dye, falling in its

 cause. Your father and his brothers did many a Clifford much 
 wrong, and woe and mourning possessed my house till the line 
 of Lancaster was restored. I cannot grieve, therefore, for the 
 exaltation of the earl of Richmond ; yet I will not passively see 
 my playmate mewed up in a cage, nor put in danger of having 
 his head laid on that ungentle pillow in Tower Yard. The 
 daughter of Warwick, our Edward's affianced bride, your crook- 
 backed uncle's wife, loved my pranks and nurtured my youth ; 
 and by her good leave, many a mirthful hour I spent in the dark 
 place you name. May neither of us ever see it more ! " 
 
 " You will, then, assist my escape ? " asked Eichard. 
 
 *' As faithfully, gossip Dickon, as God his grace shall await 
 me at the last day ! And now I will tell you a merry tale."

 IToTWiTHSTANDiNG the promise Clifford made of a merry tale, 
 both he and his auditor looked grave as he commenced. Richard 
 expected, with some anxiety, an explanation from his friend, and 
 the other assumed the self-consequence resulting from having 
 achieved a victory. No two beings ever displayed, in their way, 
 a greater contrast than these youths. The prince was many 
 inches taller than his companion, and his slim make promised 
 increase of height. His brow was smooth as infancy, candid as 
 day; his bright blue eyes were lighted up with intelligence, yet 
 there was a liquid lustre in them that betokened tenderness ; nor 
 did his lips, that nest of the heart's best feelings, belie his eyes.

 Tiiey were full, a little curled, can we say in pride, or by wliat 
 more gentle word can we name a feeling of self-elevation and 
 noble purpose, joined to benevolence and sweetness ? His oval 
 cbeeks were rounded by the dimpled chin, and his golden hair 
 clustered on a throat of marble whiteness, which, as the white 
 embroidered collar thrown back over the doublet, permitted the 
 outline to be seen, sustained his head as the Ionic flute rears its 
 graceful capital. Clifford was shorter, but firm set and more 
 manlike in form, his grey eyes were bright or dull as his soul 
 spoke in them ; his brow slightly scowled, pending over, and 
 even thus early, lines were delved in it, hardly seen when he was 
 in repose, but which, as he spoke, showed deep and distorted ; 
 his smile was tinctured by a sneer, his voice attracted no confi- 
 dence, yet Hichard now hung intently on it as he spoke : 
 
 " When I returned from doing my lord's bidding, I found him 
 moving about the room, more like a parched pea than a stately 
 noble ; for now he stood still, and then shot off with a quick 
 step, showing every sign of being ill at ease. Now, boy as I am, 
 for I can number but sixteen summers, my lord more than loves 
 me, he trusts me, and not without cause — for when at hazard-— 
 but my story will be too long — enough that ere now I have done 
 him service. Had I not known the cause of his disquiet I should 
 have asked it, but, believing myself fully aware of wha.t this all 
 meant, I went to my post, and busied myself in making some 
 flies for angling, seeming most intent upon my work. My lord 
 stood over me, and twice or thrice fetched a sigh, and then strode 
 away, and came again, saying, "I am a fool, a dolt — the king 
 can mean no ill to this lad — and yet — " I cannot tell you how long 
 this indecision lasted, while I patiently toiled at a fly of green 
 and gold, bright as those which trouts love to snap at in clear 
 streams during May. At length he asked me, ' Eobin, did you 
 mark the boy that stood in the ante-chamber?' * Aye, my good 
 lord ! ' ' And what thought you of him ? ' ' Thought, my lord ? ' 
 I spoke inquiringly, for it suddenly came across me that he did 
 not know you, and it was not for me to betray your secret. 
 * Aye,' he replied, ' thought ? Does he resemble any one you 
 ever knew ? Of what country do you divine him to be ? ' ' These 
 Flemings are sandy-haired,' I said, ' yet he does not look of 
 Flanders. Methinks he seems English born.' 
 
 " ' You are right,' said he, ' English he is confessedly. This 
 Prion calls him a natural son of De la Poole — of the late Earl of 
 Lincoln. He says that he has knowledge of a secret treasure 
 concealed by his father before this last rebellion, and the king 
 wishes to get him into his hands, thus to secure the gold. The 
 tale is not unlikely, for the Tudor ever loved the glitter — nay,

 the very dust of the precious metal, — and tlie boy resembles 
 strann^ely the House of York. Yet, I care not for the task put 
 upon me of kidnapping a child, and of betraying him into his 
 enemy's hands — perhaps of delivering him up a prisoner for life, 
 
 for the sake of Poor fellow ! if he know aught of a concealed 
 
 treasure, in God's name, let him confess it while on this side the 
 fatal channel that now divides him from tyranny or death.' 
 ' Let me deal with him,' I said, ' let me throw out some toy, such 
 as is this gold and green thread to a silly fish, and learn the 
 truth ; if he discovers the hiding-place of this so coveted coin, 
 we may spare him the trouble of his enforced journey.' ' I know 
 not that,' answered my patron ; * Master Frion is earnest for his 
 safe keeping ; and no one is nearer our liege's inner wishes than 
 this Provengal, who served him in exile, and who followed him 
 in his expedition thence ; and yet there is a noble daring in the 
 boy, a mountain freshness in his cheek, a springy freedom in his 
 gait, that it were a thousand pities to fetter and limit within 
 narrow prison bounds.' Seeing that my lord was thus favour- 
 ably inclined, I used all my poor eloquence to urge him further, 
 and at last brought him to consent that I should converse with 
 you ; learn, if possible, your secret ; inform you of your danger, 
 and advise you to escape. One only difficulty remained : my 
 lord had promised this master secretary that none should be 
 admitted to talk with you ; but when the subtle fiend, the 
 double-dealing Frenchman entered, I told him with a long visage, 
 that our noble host, the Sire de Beverem, had heard that we 
 were carrying ofi* by force a Fleming ; and that, considering his 
 hospitable mansion stained by the act, he had commanded strict 
 watch to be kept on the morrow, that if any of the English suite 
 were unwilling to go, or appeared in durance, Jie should be 
 rescued. It was advisable therefore, that you should be kept 
 in good-humour till fairly beyond the gates of Lisle ; and 
 this my wisdomship offered to do, if admitted to parlance with 
 you. You look grave, sir prince, but had you seen Frion's sage 
 look of hesitation, and heard his many exhortations that I would 
 by no means betray my knowledge of who you really were ; and 
 how I, with a bow, careful as if my curls were white from j-ears, 
 promised discretion, you would laugh as I did, when, the mime 
 over which I played before the servitor, I doffed my page's 
 seeming equality, and in duteous phrase to his highness of York, 
 offer my best services to liberate him." 
 
 " That seems already done," said Richard ; " usher me to the 
 Lord Fitzwater. I will declare myself to him ; his compassion 
 already excited ■" 
 
 "Would then be cool as snow at Christmas. Wise young

 sir, Baron Fitz water wears the blushing Eose ; and for him 
 there is wormwood in the name of York. Now, as a chance 
 offshoot of the white thorn, he only sees in you a harmless boy, 
 whom it were sin to injure; but give yourself a name whose 
 very echo would bring St. Albans, Tewkesbury, Bosworth Field, 
 and a thousand scaffolds streaming with his kinsmen's blood 
 before him, and without remorse he would let Frion have his 
 will of you. Even I, Duke Eichard, I am sprung from those 
 who fell for Lancaster " 
 
 "Enough," replied the prince, haughtily. "I am content to 
 stand alone, to achieve my freedom singly, or to submit to mv 
 fate." 
 
 " Not so, my noble, playmate," said the other. " I will not 
 offer you my knee, my oath, my sword, for my allegiance beloDgs 
 to the anointed King of England ; but, I beseech you, suffer 
 E-obin Clifford to assist high-born Plantageuet to escape from 
 a prison or from death ; permit him to pay, if not the duty of a 
 subject, yet that of a loving friend to the former companion of 
 his childish sports." 
 
 Eichard listened somewhat sullenly to these offers ; he ill 
 brooked the thought that any of English parentage should, 
 knowing who he was, refuse to acknowledge him for his liege : 
 but Clifford would not be refused ; while it was hardly worth 
 while to contend with his light spirit, which appeared incapable 
 of a serious or profound idea. After a shoi't resistance, there- 
 fore, the duke entered willingly into a discussion of the best 
 means of effecting his escape in such a way, that he should have 
 several hours the start of Frion, and be distant from danger 
 before his seducer could discover that he was not still safe in his 
 hands. 
 
 In the midst of this discussion, Frion suddenly entered. The 
 stake for which he played was too momentous to trust it wholly 
 to the stripling page, and distrust of the wily boy entered also 
 into his calculations ; he broke in, therefore, not only unan- 
 nounced, but with such stealthy quiet as showed that he meant 
 to pounce on his victim unawares. The youths sat, their stools 
 drawn close ; Clifford was leaning forward earnestly propound- 
 ing his schemes, and Eichard listened, his whole soul in his 
 countenance. Frion was close upon them before he was per- 
 ceived by either, his eyes glimmering with their usual suspicious 
 look. The artless Eichard started, and would with a conscious 
 mien have drawn back ; but Clifford, more used to the wiles and 
 watchfulness of others, and his own double mode of action, con- 
 tinued to speak in the same tone the same words, without moving 
 a muscle. The prince wondered, and regained his self-posses-

 sion ; not from entering into the deceit of his companion, but 
 from the haughty sentiment of his own dignity, which even in 
 dano:er refused to cower. 
 
 Clifford had been sayiug — "I will hence to the sire: a word 
 to him of whose secretary this Provencal is, and insinuation 
 that he is now on a secret expedition to the Flemish towns, will 
 awaken his curiosity ; he will send for him ; fortunately the 
 good knight speaks so slow that a mass can be said while he is 
 introducing the subject of his inquiries ; as each word expires, 
 he pauses while a requiem might be sung for its death ; our 
 antagonist will writhe and — " and a glance askance informed the 
 speaker that this man was at his side : he continued — " and 
 strive vainly to escape ; the heavy weight will be too much for 
 him, he must submit. Such feints suit well us boys who have 
 not strength nor skill for more declared warfare. To-morrow's 
 dawn I will practise with you in the court of the castle ere you 
 depart. But, indeed, my gossip, you must promise to be at 
 Calais on the sixteenth, when we shall see a combat of good 
 knights fit for royal princesses to look on. And now, fair sir, 
 farewell; here is your friend. The Sire de Beverem com- 
 manded my presence at this hour. If I see you not again 
 to-night, the saints have you in their keeping ! " 
 
 When Clifford, with his pagelike vivacity, ran from the room 
 singing a gay romance, Frion felt himself embarrassed ; and 
 more so when Hichard said, — " My guest, it is hard, after 
 giving you harbourage last night, that I should be forced, 
 whether I will or not, to tarry here, leaving my kinswoman in 
 dread and doubt. Make you my excuse to the chevalier, and 
 delay me no longer, I beseech you." 
 
 Frion, without directly replying, said, " Anon I will speak of 
 that; meanwhile, I have news for you." And he entered into 
 a long account of an expected sedition in Flanders, and how the 
 Sire de Beverem had promised to enlist Perkin Warbeck in his 
 particular troop, when with courage and good fortune, he could 
 not fail to rise. While he was talking, one of the men-at-arms 
 of the noble entered, and notified to Frion that his lord desired 
 an instant interview with him. The secretary hastened to obey ; 
 he thought that good fortune itself provided this excuse for him 
 to escape from his victim, and resolved not again to present 
 himself before him. He was scarcely gone when Clifford re- 
 turned. "Now quick," he cried, "down the back staircase! 
 My own steed stands saddled for you ; ride fast and far — but 
 whither — whither do you intend to go ? " 
 
 " In the first place, to Dame Madeline's cottage." 
 
 " That were midsummer madness," cried Clifford j " Frion

 will never rest till he ensnares his bird again ; nay, though I 
 trust he will not discover your escape till to-morrow morning, 
 that part of my scheme may fail ; and his papers from the king 
 are such, that my lord could not refuse to aid him, I pray you 
 set space and cloudy mystery between you." 
 
 " It shall be so. Probably I shall seek refuge at Brussels ; 
 but I must see my gentle guardian and my sweet cousin, calm 
 their fears, and bid them farewell."' 
 
 They had descended a narrow winding staircase ; Clifford 
 unlocked a postern, opening on a dark alley. A small light- 
 limbed horse stood without, held by a stout, almost gigantic 
 fellow. *' Here, Bryan," said Clifford, " this is the smuggled 
 article of which I spoke. Convey it in safety to the gate ; once 
 without, the road is known. How now, sweeting ! you sit your 
 steed as if you were used to this gear — in truth thou art a false 
 one — yet take care — fold your cloak thus. Not one kiss ere we 
 part ? " He sportively snatched the prince's hand, and pressing 
 it to his lips, continued, " No weeping, lovely : my merry heart 
 hates tears like verjuice. The blessed Virgin protect you ; I 
 must in. Remember, in every ill, Eobert Clifford is your fast, ' 
 your sworn friend. Look at her, Bryan ; one would swear by 
 her bearing it were a beardless page, and not a long-haired girl ; 
 remember, though gamesome, she is gentle, and respect her on 
 your life." 
 
 Laughing at his own deceits, the guileful boy re-entered the 
 mansion ; nor could Hichard avoid smiling at the merry and 
 ready subterfuges which his friend had at command on every 
 occasion. Brian demurely held the rein, and hardly hazarded a 
 look or covert joke, as, with a pace that put the pony to a trot, 
 he led the prince through the narrow streets to the western gate. 
 The youth breathed freely when, after having passed the hollow 
 sounding drawbridge, he saw the dark .wall of the town behind 
 him, and before, the green plain. In his haste he scarcely 
 bestowed a benison on his guide ; but snatching the rein from 
 his hand, and with the other throwing some money at his feet, 
 and exclaiming, " Beware of prating, as thou art willing to save 
 thyself from the whipping-post ! " he impatiently struck his 
 unarmed heel against the horse's sides, and bounded swiftly 
 forward. Bryan picked up the angels, and told them slowly, as 
 he said " I meant to have paid myself in other coin ; but, by St. 
 Julian, she rides more like a trooper than a gentle dame — and 
 her speech — Master Robert has before now entrusted a damsel 
 to my guidance, but they ever spoke me lovingly, with ' fair Sir,' 
 and ' sweet Bryan ! ' Forsooth, Flemish girls ruffle more like 
 pranksome pages than soft-cheeked wenches."

76 THE ESCAPE. 
 
 The thought of his conductor had passed as srviftly from the 
 prince's thoughts, as he made the ground lly from under his 
 horse's hoof. He was aware that he did neither the safest nor 
 best thing in seeking, Hke a hunted hare, the form from which 
 he had been roused in the morning ; but the desire of cahning 
 Madehne's anxiety, and imprinting a farewell kiss on the sweet 
 lips of her daughter, prevented him from altering his first pur- 
 pose. The night was cloudy and very dark, but the road was 
 known to him, and he continued at full speed till a voice, calling 
 aloud, attracted his attention — the words could not be mistaken 
 — his own name, " Perkin Warbeck ! " sounded through the 
 night. His first thought was, that he was pursued, but leflec- 
 tion told him that assuredly his pursuers would not halloo to 
 him, while any sent in search of him by Madeline, might natu- 
 rally so. try to stop him as he rode so fast through the dark. He 
 checked his speed, therefore, and in a few moments a cavalier, a 
 stranger was at his side, mounted on a tall black horse ; his 
 form seemed gigantic, and little else could be discerned ; the 
 stranger spoke to him in French, with a foreign accent. He 
 asked him, " Are you not he they call Perkin Warbeck ? " This 
 address was sufilciently startling ; and the youth haughtily re- 
 plied, " My name imports not to you, while to me this interrup- 
 tion is ur^seasonable." 
 
 • "Enough ; you go towards the cottage of Madeline de Faro : 
 I follow your highness thither." 
 
 Richard grasped the small poniard which hung from his belt ; 
 yet how could he, a child, contend with the tall and muscular 
 form beside him? "Whoever thou art," he cried, "and who- 
 ever I may be, follow me not ; I am no serf to be seized and 
 carried back to his suzerain. Depart in God's name, that the 
 fingers of neither may receive an ill stain ! " 
 
 " Thou art a gallant boy ! " cried the stranger, as placing his 
 hand on the youth's arm, his most gentle touch was felt as an 
 iron vice pressing on his flesh : " Pardon, my lord, the interfer- 
 ence of one unknown to you, though I will not call myself a 
 stranger. I am Hernan de Fero, the husband of Dame Made- 
 line ; now stay not your speed, while we hasten to relieve her 
 thousand fears. I am come in search of you." 
 
 The heart of Eichard warmed towards iiis new friend ; he felt, 
 that with him on his side, he might defy Frion, Fitzwater, and 
 all their followers ; for there was something in De Faro's mien, 
 which spoke of a thousand combats, and as many victories ; his 
 deep voice out-roared the elements ; his hand might arrest a 
 wild horse in mad career. "When they arrived at the wicket 
 entrance to the cot, he lifted the boy from the saddle, as a child

 would handle a toy, and sliouted aloud in his own language, 
 " Viva el Duque de Inglatierra j el Marinero, Hernan de JFaro." 
 
 The dano^ers Eichard had run, and the delight she experienced 
 in seeing him, when again under her roof, stopped all Madeline's 
 reproaches. " Is he not worthy all my fears ? " she said to her 
 husband, who stood eyeing the boy as .he caressed his daughter. 
 De Faro stretched out his hand, saying, " Will you, SeHor Don 
 Ricardo, accept my services, and my vow to protect you till the 
 death, so help me the Blessed Virgin and the Holy Trinity." 
 
 De Faro was a mariner who had sailed in the service of the 
 king of Portugal, along the unsounded shores of Africa, and 
 sought beyond the equator a route to the spicy Indian land. 
 His dark skin was burnt to a nearly negro die ; his black curled 
 hair, his beard and moustachios of the same dusky hue, half hid 
 his face ; his brow somewhat lowered over eyes dark as night ; 
 but, when he smiled, his soft mouth and pearly teeth, softened 
 the harshness of his physiognomy, and he looked gentle and kind. 
 Every nerve, every muscle, had been worn and hardened by long 
 toilsome navigation; his strong limbs had withstood the tempest, 
 his hands held unmoved the cordage, which the whirlwind strove 
 vainly to tear from his grasp. He was a tower of a man ; yet 
 withal one, to whom the timid and endangered would recur for 
 refuge, secure of his generosity and dauntless nature. He heard 
 the story of [Richard's dangers; his plan was formed swiftly: he 
 said, *•' If you choose, Sir Prince, to await your foes here, I am 
 ready, having put these girls in safety, to barricade the doors, 
 and with arquebus and sword to defend 3'^ou to the last : but 
 there is a safer and better way for us all. I am come to claim 
 my Madeline and our child, and to carry them with me to my 
 native Spain. My vessel now rides off Ostend. I had meant 
 to make greater preparation, and to have laid up some weeks 
 here before we went on our home-bound voyage ; but, as it is, 
 let us depart to-night." 
 
 The door suddenly opened as he spoke — Madeline shrieked — 
 Hichard sprang upon his feet, while De Faro rose more slowly, 
 
 Placing himself like a vast buttress of stone before the intruder, 
 t was Clifford. 
 " All is safe for the night," he cried ; *' your grace has a few 
 hours the start, and but a few ; dally not here ! " 
 
 Again the discussion of whither he should fly was renewed, 
 and the duke spoke of Brussels — of his aunt. " Of poison and 
 pit-falls," cried Robert ; " think you, boy as you are, and, under 
 pardon, no conjuror, that the king will not contrive your de- 
 struction ? " 
 
 Probably self-interested motives swayed Clifford; but he

78 THE ESCArE. 
 
 entered warmly into De Faro's idea of liastening to the sea-coast, 
 and of sailiniT direct for Spain. " In a few years you will be a 
 man — in a few years " 
 
 " Forgotten ! Yes — I may go ; but a few months shall mark 
 my return. I go on one condition ; that you, CliiTord, watch 
 for the return of my cousin, Sir Edmund, and direct him where 
 to find me." 
 
 " I will not fail. Sir Mariner, whither are you bound ? " 
 
 " To Malaga." 
 
 And now, urged and quickened by Cliflford, who promised to 
 attend to all that this sudden resolve left incomplete, the few 
 arrangements for their departure were made. Favoured by 
 night, and the prince's perfect knowledge of the country, tliey 
 were speedily on their way to Ostend. Clifford returned to 
 Lisle, to mark and enjoy Frion's rage and Fitzwater'e confusion, 
 when, on the morrow, the quarry was found to have stolen from 
 its lair. Without a moment's delay, the secretary followed, he 
 hoped, upon his track : he directed his steps to Brussels. A 
 letter meanwhile from Ostend, carefully worded, informed Clif- 
 ford of the arrival and embarkation of his friends ; again he was 
 reminded of Pkntagenet; nor had he long to wait before he 
 fulfilled this last commission. 
 
 Edmund had found the Lady Margaret glad to receive tidings 
 of her nephew; eager to ensure his safety and careful bringing- 
 Tip, but dispirited by the late overthrow, and deeply grieved by 
 the death of the noble and beloved Lincoln : no attack could 
 now be made ; it would be doubly dangerous to bring forward 
 the young Eichard at this juncture. She commissioned Plau- 
 tagenet to accompany him to Brussels that she might see him ; 
 and then they could confer upon some fitting plan for the privacy 
 and security of his future life, until maturer age fitted him to 
 enter on his destined struggles. 
 
 Edmund returned with brightened hopes to Tournay, to find 
 the cottage deserted, his friends gone. It may easily be imagined 
 that this unexpected blank was a source of terror, almost of 
 despair to the adventurer. He feared to ask questions, and 
 when he did propound a few, the answers only increased his 
 perplexity and fears. It was not until his third hopeless visit to 
 the empty dwelling, that he met a stripling page, who, with an 
 expression of slyness in his face, spoke the watchword of the 
 friends of York. Edmund gladly exchanged the countersign, 
 and then the boy asked him, whether he called himself cousin to 
 the fugitive duke of York, laughing the while at the consterna- 
 tion his auditor exhibited at the utterance of this hidden and 
 sacred word: "You come to seek your prince," he continued,

THE ESCAPE. 79 
 
 "and wonder wliither he may be flown, and what corner of the 
 earth's wilderness- affords him an abode. He is now, by my 
 calculations, tossing about in a weather-beaten caravel, com- 
 manded by Hernan de Faro, in the Bay of Biscay ; in another 
 month he may anchor in the port of Malaga ; and the dark-eyed 
 girls of Andalusia will inform you in what nook of their sunny 
 land the fair-haired son of England dwells. The king is defeated, 
 Master Frion balked, and Lord Fitzwater gone on a bootless 
 errand : the White Rose floui'ishes free as those that bloom in 
 our Kentish hedges." 
 
 Without waiting for a reply, but with his finger on his lip to 
 repel further speech, the youth vaulted on his horse, and was 
 out of sight in a moment. Edmund doubted for some time 
 whether he should act upon this singular communication. He 
 endeavoured to learn who his informant was, and, at last, became 
 assured that it was Robert Clifford, a young esquire in Lord 
 Fitzwater's train. He was the j^ounger son of the Lord Clifford 
 who fell for Lancaster, at the battle of St. Alban's. By birth, by 
 breeding, he was of the Red Rose, yet it was evident that his 
 knowledge was perfect as to the existence of the duke of York ; 
 and the return of Lord Fitzwater and Xing Henry's secretary 
 to Lisle, disappointed and foiled, served to inspire confidence in 
 the information he had bestowed. After much reflection, Plan- 
 tagenet resolved to visit Paris, where he knew that the brother 
 of Madeline, old John A¥arbeck, then sojourned ; and, if he did 
 not gain surer intelligence from him, to proceed by way of 
 Bordeaux to Spain.

 CHAPTER XI. 
 
 THE EXILES. 
 
 A day will come when York shall claim his own ; 
 Then York be still awhile, till time do serve. 
 
 SnAKSPEARE- 
 
 The further Edmund journeyed from tlie late abode of his lost 
 cousin, the more he felt displeased at the step he had taken ; 
 but on his arrival in Paris his uncertainty ended. Warbeck had 
 received intimation of the hurried embarkation of his sister, 
 and here also he found Lady Brampton, whose husband Lad 
 taken refuge in Paris after the battle of Stoke. Like the quecn- 
 dovras^er, the fate of Margaret of Anjou's son haunted this lady, 
 and she warmly espoused the idea of bringing the duke of York 
 up in safe obscurity-, until his own judgment might lead him to 
 choose another line of action, or the opposing politics of Europe 
 promised some support to his cause. She agreed to repair 
 herself to Brussels, to take counsel with the duchess, to use all 
 her influence and arts, and, as soon as time was ripe, to proceed 
 herself to Spain to announce it to the prince. Meanwhile, 
 Plantagenet, following his former purpose, would take up his 
 abode with Eichard in Spain ; teach him the science of arms, 
 and the more difficult lessons of courage, self-command, and 
 prudent conduct. In pursuance of this plan, Edmund lost no 
 time in going to Bordeaux, whence he embarked for Malaga, and 
 following his friend's steps, arrived shortly after him at the 
 retreat De Faro had chosen among the foldings of the moun- 
 tains on the borders of Andalusia.* 
 
 De Faro's was a singular history. In those days, that park 
 of Andalusia which comprised the kingdom of Granada, was 
 the seat of perpetual wars, and even when armies did not meet 
 
 * I had originally entered more at largre on a description of Andalusia, and the 
 history of the conquest of Granada. The subsequent publication of Mr. Washingr- 
 ton Irvinj^'s very interesting work has superseded the necessity of this deviation 
 from the straigrht path of my story. Events which, in their romantic detail, were 
 before only to be found in old Spanish folios, are now accesi^ible to every English 
 reader, adorned by the elegance of style, and arranged with the exquisite taste, 
 which characterize the very delightful " Chronicle of the Conquest of Gianada."

THE EXILES. 81 
 
 to deluge its fertile plains and valleys with tlieir blood, troops 
 led by noble cavaliers and illustrious commanders overran its 
 districts in search of plunder and glory. During one of these 
 incursions, in the year 1452, some impulse of rehgion or humanity 
 made a Spanish soldier snatch from a couch in the country-liouse 
 of a noble wealthy Moor, already half cohsumed, an infant hardly 
 a year old ; the band was already in full retreat, and, fortunately, 
 tliis incident took place on the very frontiers of Granada, or the 
 benevolence of the soldier would hardly have been proof against 
 the trouble his little charge occasioned him. ToiHng up the 
 mountains on their return to the kingdom of Jaen, they entered 
 the little town of Alcala-la-Heal, where, on the side of the 
 mountainous road, rose the walls of a monastery. "How 
 better," thought the soldier, ** save the soul of this boy than by 
 giving him to the monks?" It was not, perhaps, the present 
 they would most readily have selected, but compassion and 
 piety forbade them to refuse it: the little Moor became a 
 Christian by the name of Hernan, and was brought up within 
 the sacred precincts of the convent. Though the monks were 
 able to make a zealous Catholic of their nursling, they did not 
 succeed so well in taming his fiery spirit, nor could they induce 
 him to devote himself to the inactive and mortifying life of a 
 priest. Yet he was generous and daring, and thus acquired 
 their affection ; next to being a recluse vowed to God, the 
 vocation of a soldier for the faith, in the eyes of these holy men, 
 was to be selected. Hernan advancing in life, and shooting up 
 into strong and premature manhood, was recommended by the 
 abbot to his cousin, the illustrious Don Eodrigo Ponce de Leon, 
 marquess of Cadiz. He fought several times under his banners, 
 and in the year 1471 entered with him the kingdom of Granada, 
 and was wounded at the taking of Cardela. In this last action 
 it was, that a sudden horror of taking up arms against his 
 countrymen sprung up in Hernan's breast. He quitted Spain 
 in consequence ; and, visiting Lisbon, he was led to embrace a 
 sea-faring life, and entered the marine service of the king of 
 Portugal ; at one time, visiting Holland, where he sought and 
 won the hand of Madeline : and afterwards, with Bartholomew 
 Diaz, he made one of the crew that discovered the Cape of Good 
 Hope. He sailed with three vessels, one of which lost company 
 of the others, and its crew underwent various and dreadful perils 
 at sea, and from the blacks on land : after nine months they 
 again fell in with their companions, three sailors only remaining. 
 One of these was Hernan de Faro ; his skill, valour, and forti- 
 tude, had saved the vessel -, he was exalted to its command,

82 THE EXILES. 
 
 and now, in safer voyage over seas more known, lie had frciglited 
 it with the fugitives from Tournay. 
 
 During all his wanderings, even in the gay and rich Portugal, 
 Hernan turned with fond regret to his mountain home. To its 
 rugged peaks, its deep and silent dells ; its torrents, its verdure, 
 its straggling and precipitous paths ; its prospect over the rich 
 and laughing Vega of Granada. He had promised himself, after 
 weary toils, a long repose in this beloved spot ; and hither he 
 now led his wife, resolving to set up his tent for ever in the land 
 of his childhood, his happy childhood. It was a strange place to 
 choose, bordering on Granada, which at that time was as lists in 
 which Death and Havock sat umpires. But the situation of 
 Alcala-la-Keal preserved it secure, notv. ithstanding its dangerous 
 neighbourhood. It was perched high upon the mountain, over- 
 looking a plain which had been for many years the scene of 
 ruthless carnage and devastation, being in itself an asylum for 
 fugitives— a place of rest for the victor — an eagle's nest, unas- 
 sailable by the vultures of the plain. 
 
 Here, then, Plantagenet found his cousin ; here, in lovely and 
 romantic Spain. Though defaced and torn by war, Andalusia 
 presented an aspect of rich and various beauty, intoxicating to 
 one whose life had been spent in the plains of England, or the 
 dull flats of Flanders. The purple vineyards ; the olive planta- 
 tions clothing the burning hill-side ; the groves of mulberry, 
 cork, pomegranate, and citron, that diversified the fertile vegas 
 or plains ; the sweet flowing rivers, with their banks adorned 
 by scarlet geranium or odoriferous myrtle, made this spot 
 Nature's own favoured garden — a paradise unequalled upon 
 earth. On such a scene did the mountain-home of the exiles 
 look down. Alcala, too, had beauties of her own. Ilex and pine 
 woods clothed the defiles of the rugged Sierra, which stretched 
 far and wide, torn by winter torrents into vast ravines ; varia- 
 gated by a thousand intersecting lines, formed by the foldings 
 of the hills ; the clouds found a home on the lofty summits ; the 
 wandering mists crept along the abrupt precipices ; alternate 
 light and shadow, rich in purple and golden hues, arrayed each 
 rocky peak or verdant slope in radiance all their own. 
 
 All this fair land had been under the dominion of the Moors. 
 Now, town by town, stronghold by stronghold, they had lost it ; 
 the riches of the land belonged to the Christians, who still, by 
 military conquest or policy, pressed the realm of the Moorish 
 sovereign into a narrower compass ; while, divided in itself, the 
 unhappy kingdom fell piecemeal into their hands. De Faro was

 bered tliat he was a Moor : whenever he saw a Moslem prisoner 
 in chains, or a cavalgada of hapless women driven from their 
 native towns to slavery, the blood in his veins moved with 
 instinctive horror ; and the idea that among them mi^ht pine 
 and groan his parents, his own relatives, burned like living coal 
 in his breast. He had half forgotten this when he came to 
 Alcala, bringing his wife and child, and resolved to set up here 
 his home ; but when, in the succeeding spring, the Spanish 
 army assembled on the frontiers of Murcia, and swept on 
 towards the south — when deeds of Moorish valour and Moorish 
 suffering reached Alcala — when the triumph of the Chris- 
 tians and their ravages were repeated — the gallant mariner 
 could endure no longer. " It is a fruitless struggle," he said ; 
 " Granada must fall ; and God, who searches hearts, knows that 
 his victory will be dear to me when the cross floats from the 
 towers of the Alhambra. But I cannot behold the dark, blood- 
 staineil advances of the invader. I will go — go where man 
 destroys not his brother, where the wild winds and waves are 
 the armies vs e combat. In a year or two every sword will be 
 sheathed ; the peace of conquest will reign over Andalusia. One 
 other voyage, and I return." 
 
 He went without fear, for Alcala appeared a safe retreat, and 
 left his family spectators of the war. What a school for Hichard ! 
 Edmund rejoiced that he would be accomplished in knightly 
 exercise in the land of chivalry ; but he was not prepared for the 
 warlike enthusiasm that sprung up in his cousin's heart, and even 
 in his own. It was the cause of God that armed the gentlemen 
 of Spain, that put daring into the politic Ferdinand's heart, and 
 inspired with martial ardour the magnanimous Isabella. The 
 veteran cavaliers had lost many relatives and companions in 
 arms, in various defeats under the rocky castles, or uithin 
 the pathless defiles of Andalusia; and holy zeal possessed 
 them to avenge their deaths, or to deliver those who pined in 
 bondage. The younger knights, under the eye of their sove- 
 reigns, emulated each other in gallantry and glory. They 
 painted war with pomp, and adorned it by their virtues. 
 
 Not many months before, the earl of Rivers, with a band of 
 Englishmen, aided at the siege of Loxa, and distinguished 
 himself by his undaunted bravery ; his blunt but gay humour ; 
 his eager emulation with the Spanish commanders. The duke of 
 York heard, with a leaping heart, his mother's brother's name. 
 Had he still been there ; but no, he had returned to fall in 
 affray in Britany, the victim of Tudor's heartless desertion — 
 this circumstance had given distinction and honour to the name 
 of Englishmen ; nor did Edmund feel inclined to lower the

 national character by keeping away from tlie scene of glory. 
 What was to be done ? York was a mere boy ; yet when Plan- 
 tagenet spoke of servinfi: under one of the illustrious Catholic 
 chieftains, York said, " I follow you ; I will be your squire, 
 your pao^e, your stirrup-boy ; but I follow ! " 
 
 In 1489 the siege of Baza was formed. It was defended with 
 desperate valour by the Moors, while every noble Spaniard 
 capable of bearing arms assembled in Ferdinand's camp, which 
 glittered in silks and gay caparisons ; yet the very luxury of the 
 warriors was ennobled by their valour. The sallies on the part 
 of the besieged were furious ; the repulse they sustained, deter- 
 mined and successful. When closely hemmed in, the Moors 
 relaxed in their desperate efforts. The younger Christian 
 cavaliers used the leisure so afforded them to unite in making 
 incursions in the surrounding country, to cut off supplies, and 
 to surprise the foraging-parties of the enemy. Two youths 
 became conspicuous in these exploits ; both proclaimed their 
 English origin. One bore a knight's golden spurs (Edmund had 
 been knighted on the eve of the battle of Stoke by the earl of 
 Lincoln), and boasted of his royal, though illegitimate, descent ; 
 the other, a beardless, fair-haired, blooming boy, was nameless, 
 save by the Christian appellation of Eicardo, to which was added 
 the further designation of El Muchacho, from his extreme youth. 
 It was a lovely yet an awful sight to behold this pair. The elder, 
 whose dark eyes and dun complexion gave him a greater resem- 
 blance to his southern comrades, never lost sight of his young 
 friend ; side by side, his shield before Eichard's breast, they 
 went to the field. When Edmund would otherwise have pressed 
 forward, he hung back to guard his cousin ; and when the boy 
 was hurried forward in the ardour of fight, still his kinsman's 
 gaze was on him — his sword protecting him in every aspect of 
 danger. If the stripling were attacked, Edmund's eyes flashed 
 fire, and mortal vengeance fell upon his foe. They became the 
 discourse of the camp ; and Plantagenet's modesty, and Eichard's 
 docility in all, save avoiding peril, advanced them still further in 
 the favour of the grave, courteous Spaniards. " Art thou, then, 
 motherless ? " Isabel asked ; " if thou art not, thy gentle parent 
 must pass many wakeful nights for thee ! " At length, in one 
 skirmish, both the youths got surrounded by the foe. Eichard's 
 young arm, wearied by the very sword he bore, gave ineffectual 
 blows. Forgetting that he left himself unguarded, Edmund 
 rushed between him and his assailant ; others came to their 
 assistance ; but Plantagenet was already struck to the ground ; 
 and for many weeks York forgot even the glorious emulation of 
 arms, while watching over his best and dearest friend. Mean-

 while Baza surrendered ; and the cousins returned to Alcala, to 
 Madeline and her fair child ; and domestic peace succeeded to 
 the storms of war. Richard loved Madeline as his mother ; her 
 daughter was his sister, his angel sister, whose tenderness and 
 heroism of character commanded deep affection. 
 
 Monina de Faro was, even in childhood, a being to worship 
 and to love. There was a dreamy sweetness in her countenance, 
 a mystery in the profound sensibility of her nature, that fasci- 
 nated beyond all compare. Her characteristic was not so much 
 the facility of being impressed, as the excess of the emotion pro- 
 duced by every new idea or feeling. Was she gay ? — her large 
 eyes laughed in their own brightness, her lovely countenance 
 became radiant with smiles, her thrilling voice was attuned 
 to lightest mirth, while the gladness that filled her heart over- 
 flowed from her as light does from the sun, imparting to all 
 around a share of its own essence. Did sorrow oppress her ?-— 
 dark night fell upon her mind, clouding her face, oppressing 
 her whole person, which staggered and bent beneath the freight. 
 Had she been susceptible of the stormier passions, her subtle 
 and yielding soul would have been their unresisting victim— 
 but though impetuous — wild — the slave of her own sensations, 
 her soft bosom could harbour no emotion unallied to goodness : 
 and the devouring appetite of her soul, was the desire of benefit- 
 ing all around her. Her countenance was the mirror of her 
 mind. Its outline resembled those we see in Spanish pictures, 
 not being quite oval enough for a northern beauty. It seemed 
 widened at the forehead, to give space for her large, long eyes, 
 and the canopy of the darkly fringed and veined lid :.her hair 
 was not black, but of a rich sunny chesnut, finer than carded 
 silk, and more glossy ; her skin was delicate, somewhat pale, 
 except when emotion suffused it with a deep pink. In person, 
 she was not tall, but softly rounded ; and her taper, rosy-tipped 
 fingers, and little feet, bespoke the delicate proportion that 
 moulded her form to a beauty, whose every motion awakened 
 admiration and love. 
 
 With these companions Richard passed the winter. The 
 following spring brought war still nearer to the English exiles — • 
 Baza had fallen ; one of tt^e kings of Granada, surnamed El 
 Zagal, the Valiant, had submitted to the Spaniards : and now 
 Ferdinand commanded his former ally, Boabdil el Chico, to 
 deliver up to him proud Granada, the loved city of the Moors. 
 Poor Boabdil, whose misfortunes had been prophesied at his 
 birth, and whose whole career had been such as to affix to him 
 the surname of el Zogoybi, or the Unfortunate, was roused from 
 his state of opprobrious vassalage by this demand, and followed

 Tip his refusal by an Inroad into tlie Christian country, near 
 Jaen. Count de Tendilla, a veteran vrarrior of high reputation 
 and brilliant exploits, commanded this district. His head- 
 quarters were in the impregnable fortress of Alcala-la-Eeal 
 itself; and when the cry came, that the Moors had passed his 
 border, he resolved to stoop from his eagle's eyrie, and to pounce 
 upon the insolent foe, as they returned from their incursion. He 
 chose one hundred and fifty men, and lay in ambush for them. 
 Plantagcnet was of the number, and our young warrior also ; 
 though with sage entreaties Edmund, and with tears Madeline, 
 had besought him to stay. The count succeeded to his wish — 
 the Moors fell into his toils — few escaped slaughter or capture.: 
 but while the Christian hero exulted in victory, a messenger, 
 pale with horror, spent with weariness, came to tell that a band 
 of Moors had taken advantage of his absence, to fall upon Alcala. 
 Indignation and fury possessed the noble captain ; he left half 
 his troop to protect his spoil, and with the rest, all weary as they 
 were, he hurried back to Alcala, eager to fall upon the marauders 
 before they should have secured their prey in a neighbouring for- 
 tress. Edmund and Richard were among the foremost ; their rage 
 could only be calmed by the swiftness with which they returned 
 to deliver or avenge their friends. The sun was sinking in the 
 west when they arrived at the foot of the Sierra. At first 
 Tendilladesiredthathis wearied troop should repose; but several 
 stragglers among the enemy, perceiving them, gave the alarm to 
 their comrades, who, laden with booty, were preparing to depart. 
 Harassed as the Christians were, they had no choice, while 
 their position, on the lower ground, rendered their attack very 
 disadvantageous. But nothing could cheek their fury : with 
 loud cries and flashing weapons they fell upon the enemy, who, 
 burthened by their prey and wearied by their very outrages, 
 could ill resist men fighting to avenge their desolated hearths. 
 Still, so accustomed to war, so innately brave was every soldier 
 on either side, that the combat was long and sanguinary. Night, 
 the swift-walking darkness of the nights of the .south, came sud- 
 demy upon the combatants : the casques of one party, and the 
 turbans of the other, were scarce perceptible, to guide the 
 scimitar, or to serve as an aim for the arquebus. The discomfited 
 Moors, leaving their booty, dispersed along the defiles, and, 
 forgetful of their prisoners, availed themselves of the obscurity 
 to make good their flight. Alcala was retaken ; and through the 
 shadows of night, husbands and fathers called aloud on their 
 wives and children to tell them if they were safe, while many a 
 sound of woman's wail arose over the corpse of him who had 
 died to save her.

 The troop, diminislied in number, was drawn up the following 
 morning in the square of Alcala. " Where," asked the count, 
 " are my two English soldiers ? I saw the* elder leading five 
 others across a steep mountain-path, so as to fall on the enemy's 
 rear ; it was a sage measure, and succeeded well. Eicardo I 
 beheld contending with two bearded Moors, who held in their 
 fierce grasp a young and fainting girl. I sent Diego to his 
 rescue : Diego, they say, was slain : night prevented me from 
 knowing more : have both these strangers fallen ? I would pay 
 them a Spaniard's thanks for their aid — a knight's praise for 
 their gallantry." 
 
 Alas ! botli thanks and praise would have visited their ears 
 coldly. They had forgotten Tendilla, his troop, the very Cliris- 
 tian cause, in the overwhelming calamity that had befallen them. 
 Assisted by Diego, who was cut down in the conflict, Eichard 
 had delivered Monina ; and, forcing his way through the enemy, 
 now already scattered, clambered with her in his arms to their 
 mountain abode : he was guided towards it by the glaring light 
 of the flames that destroyed it. Meanwhile, the fight still 
 raged ; York placed Monina in safety, and returned to share its 
 perils. 
 
 The peace of desolation that came with the morning united 
 the cousins ; and they sought the ruins of their home, and their 
 miserable friend, whose broken and harrowing tale recorded how 
 Madeline had fallen a victim to the savage cruelty of the enemy, 
 as she strove to defend her daughter from impending slavery. 
 
 This was the result of Moorish wars — death and misery. 
 Eichard's young heart had bounded to the sound of trump and 
 clarion ; and he returned to hear the melancholy bell that tolled 
 for death. Their very home was in ruins ; but it was long before, 
 amidst deeper woe, they remembered to lament the destruction 
 of many papers and hoarded objects, the relics and the testi- 
 monies of Eichard's royal descent.

 This was a gloomy lesson for these young and affectionate 
 beings ; they consoled one another, and wept as they consoled. 
 At first Monina despaired ; her ceaseless laments and nnassuaged 
 grief appeared to undermine her very life ; but, when she marked 
 the sorrow she communicated, when she heard Eichard exclaim, 
 *' Oh ! for spring and battle, when I may avenge Monina's grief, 
 or die ! Death is a thousand times preferable to the sight of her 
 ■woe !" and felt that the fate and happiness of those about her 
 depended on her fortitude : she forced smiles back to her lips, 
 and again her sweet eyes beamed, undimmed by tears. 
 
 Spring came at last, and with it busy preparation for the siege 
 of Granada ; troop after troop defiled through Alcala, bearing 
 the various ensigns of the noble commanders ; the Count Tendilla, 
 leaving his mountain nest, united himself to the regal camp 
 before the devoted city ; Isabella joined her royal husband 
 accompanied by her children. "Where women looked on the 
 near face of war, even the timid were inspired to bear arms. 
 The reputation the English warrior youths had gained forbade 
 inglorious ease, even had they not aspired with their whole hearts 
 for renown ; yet Plantagenet looked forward with reluctance to 
 the leading forth his brave, dear cousin to new dangers ; divided 
 between pride in his valour, satisfaction at his thus being 
 schooled to arms, and terror from the perils to which he would 
 be exposed in a war, on the side of the enemy, of despair and 
 fury — his thouirhtful eyes rested on the young prince's glowing 
 cheek, his unsullied youth j if wound or fatal hurt maimed his

 fair proportion, how should he reply to his widowed mother's 
 agony ? If, snapt like a poor flowret, he fell upon the dealh- 
 strewn Vega, what tale should he report to the ardent Yorkists ? 
 None ! At least he should be pierced only through him, and 
 Edmund's corse would rampart his heart, even when he had 
 died to save him. 
 
 Thus they again appeared in the Spanish army, and were 
 hailed as among its ornaments. Whatever desperate enterprise 
 kindled the young Spaniards to heroic frenzy, found the English 
 pair among their numbers. At the beginning of the siege, the 
 Moors, few in numbers, and often defeated, cheated victory of 
 its triumph by various challenges to single combat, where many 
 a Spaniard fell : their frays resembled, in the splendour of their 
 armour and their equipments, the stately ceremonial of the 
 tournaments, but they were deadly in the event. Ferdinand, 
 sure of victory, and reluctant to expose the noble youth of his 
 kingdom to needless peril, forbade these duels ; and the Moors 
 enraged, multiplied their insults and their bravadoes, to draw 
 their enemies to the field ; nor lost any opportunity of commit- 
 ing the defence of their beloved city to the risk of battle, rather 
 than the slow progress of famine. One memorable engagement 
 took place on occasion of the visit of Queen Isabella to the ham- 
 let of Zubia, there to obtain a nearer view of beautiful Granada. 
 The Moors seeing the Spanish troops in array before their walls, 
 came out to attack them ; a battle was fought under the very eyes 
 of the queen, wherein it was the good fortune of Eichard to make 
 so gallant a figure, that on the very spot the Count Tendilla 
 conferred on him the honour of knighthood. 
 
 Proud was the young duke of York, and eager to paint his 
 maiden shield with worthy device ; he was now nearly eighteen, 
 boyish in aspect, yet well-knit in person, and accustomed to the 
 fatigue of arms. He no longer burst on his foes, like an 
 untrained dog, seeking only to slay : there was forethought in 
 his eye, and a most careful selection of worthy and valorous 
 opponents. Edmund still was to be found within a javelin's 
 throw of him ; but he no longer feared his untaught rashness, as 
 before he had done. 
 
 In July occurred the conflagration of the Christian camp. The 
 day following, Eerdina-nd led forth his troops to make a last 
 ravage among the gardens and orchards, the emerald girdle of 
 Granada. During the fray, it was the young duke's chance to 
 throw his javelin so as to slay on the spoib a veteran Moor, whose 
 turban having fallen off, exposed him thus. His companion in 
 arms, a tall fierce Moslem, rushed forward to fell the insolent 
 youth ; others interposed. Still the Moor kept his eye upon his

 boyish foe ; a tliousand times he threw his dart ; twice or thrice 
 he rushed on him with uplifted scimitar : the battle racked among 
 the orchard-paths and flowery hedges of the thickly-planted 
 gardens, and erer some obstruction thwarted the infidel. Plan- 
 tagenet had marked his rage and his purpose ; he watched him 
 keenly, and the fierce Gomelez boiled with impatient indignation, 
 as some impediment for ever baffled his design. His last effort 
 was to fling an arrow, which stuck in the ground quivering at 
 Richard's feet : a label was aflBxed — " Dog and infidel," thus was 
 the cartel worded — "if thou hast courage, meet me at dawn at 
 the Fountain of Myrtles." 
 
 The following morning, at the hour when Plantagenet was 
 wont to see his cousin, the prince was absent. Noon ap- 
 proached ; the troops reposed after the battle of the day before, 
 or were employed in clearing the dark ruins of the camp : some 
 thoughtless project might occupy the duke : some excursion to 
 the other side of Granada. The shades of evening gathered 
 round the lofty towers, and dimmed the prospect of its Vega : 
 still Richard came not. Sad, anxious night drew near. Edmund 
 roved through the camp, questioning, seeking ; at last, on the 
 morrow he heard the report, that the previous evening a cava- 
 lier had seen Almoradi Gomelez issue from a little wood half 
 a league from the city, and ride towards a postern ; that he was 
 galloping up to him, when he saw the Moor totter in his saddle, 
 and at last fall from his horse ; before succour could come, he 
 died. His last words only spoke of the Fountain of Myrtles ; 
 in agony of spirit, for Gomelez had surely stricken to death 
 his stripling foe, ere he left the place of combat, Edmund 
 hurried to the spot ; the herbage round the fountain was tram- 
 pled and torn, as by horses' hoofs. It was moistened, but not 
 with water ; a bank, thickly overgrown with geraniums, bore 
 the print of a man's form, but none was there. 
 
 Monina had been left in Alcala-la-Real, a prey to fear, to 
 gaze from the steep summit on the plain, whereon, beyond her 
 sight, was acted the real drama of her life ; to question 
 the wounded, or the messengers that visited Alcala, and to ad- 
 dress prayers to the Virgin, were the sad varieties! of her day. 
 In the midst of this suspense, two unexpected guests visited 
 her abode — her father, and an Irish chieftain ; a Yorkist, who 
 came to lead the duke from his Spanish abode, to where he 
 might combat for his lost crown. De Faro had not heard of 
 the death of Madeline ; and with awe his child beheld the tears 
 that bedewed his rugged checks at this sad termination of his 
 ocean-haunting vision. He embraced his daughter — " Thou 
 wilt not desert me; we will leave this fated spot: and thou,

 Monina, will sail for ever witli thy father on the less barbarous 
 sea." 
 
 De Faro's companion vras named Lord Barry. He was 
 baron of Buttevant, in the county of Cort, and allied to the 
 Geraldines, chiefs of that soil. He had fought at Stoke, and 
 been attainted by Henry ; so that he was forced to wander a 
 banished man. Eager to reinstate himself, every Yorkist plot 
 numbered him among its warmest partizans. He had for some 
 time resided either at Paris or at Brussels, where he often held 
 counsel with Lady Brampton. Weary of delay, he at last 
 stole back to Ireland, to see whether his noble kinsmen there 
 would abet and rise in favour of the duke of York. He came 
 away, proud and delighted with his success ; promises of service 
 for the White Eose had been showered on him — his eloquence 
 and enthusiasm conquered even Lady Brampton. War also 
 seemed impending between France and Enofland ; if that were 
 once declared, every objection would be obviated. At any rate, 
 the times seemed so fair, that she agreed with Lord Barry to 
 visit the present home of the young English prince ; and, as 
 if to further their designs. Sir Edward Brampton was at that 
 moment requested by the Archduke Maximilian to undertake a 
 private embassy to Lisbon. Thither they had sailed, and now, 
 leaving this lady in Portugal, Lord Barry had continued his 
 voyage to Andalusia, with the intention of returning again to 
 Lisbon, accompanied by the promise and hope of the house of 
 York. He met De Faro in the port of Malaga: the name 
 was famihar to him. They journeyed together to Alcala-la- 
 Real. 
 
 Lord Barry was all eagerness that the English prince should 
 immediately join Lady Brampton at Lisbon. It was agreed 
 that they should proceed thither in De Faro's caravel. The 
 mariner abhorred the name of warfare betwen Spaniard and 
 Moor ; and Madeline's death only added poignancy to this sen- 
 sation. He would not look on the siege of Granada. While 
 tlie L*ish noble and Monina proceeded to the camp to prepare 
 the cousins, he returned to Malaga to bring round his vessel to 
 the nearer port of Almeria. Lord Barry and the fair Moor 
 commenced their journey on the morning of a most burning 
 day ; they wound down the steep declivities of the Sierra, and 
 entered upon the bright blooming plain. jSToon with all its heat 
 approached. They rested under a grove of mulberries, reposing 
 by a brook, while Lord Barry's horse. and Monina's mule were 
 tied to the nearest shrubs. Slight accidents are the wires and 
 pullies on which the machinery of our lives hang. Stung by 
 flies, the noble horse grew restive, broke his rein, and galloped

 away ; tlirougli the tliick shade his master pursued, till tramp of 
 feet and crackling of branches died on Monina's ear. A quarter 
 of an hour, half an hour passed, when on her solitude came 
 a Moorish voice, an exclamation in the name of Allah, and the 
 approach of several men whom already she painted as enemies. 
 To take to her mule, to ride swiftly through the grove, was the 
 impulse of her fear ; and, when again silence gave her token 
 of security, she found that she had lost her way. It was only 
 after many vain attempts that she extricated herself from the 
 wood, and then perceived that she had wandered from the direct 
 road to Granada, whose high towers were visible at a distance. 
 The burning July noonday sun scorched her. Her mule lagged 
 in his pace. As a last effort, she sought a plantation of elms, 
 not far distant. The grateful murmur of flowing waters saluted 
 her ears as she approached. Por a few minutes more she was 
 expose^ to the glaring sunshine, and then entered the cool 
 umbrage of the trees — the soft twilight of woven leaves and 
 branches ; a fountain rose in the midst, and she hastened to 
 refresh herself by sprinkling herself with cool waters. Thus 
 occupied, she thought she was alone in this sequestered nook, 
 when a crash among the underwood startled her : the mule 
 snorted aloud, and from the brake issued a mare caparisoned 
 with saddle and bridle. She had lost her rider ; vet her dis- 
 tended nostrils, the foam that flaked her sides, the shiver that 
 made her polished skin quiver, spoke of recent contest or flight. 
 She looked on her — could it be ? She called her " Daraxa," 
 and the animal recognized her voice ; while, in answer to the 
 dreadful surmises that awoke in her heart, a low groan was 
 heard from the near bank. Turning, she beheld the form of 
 a man lying on the herbage ; not dead, for he groaned again, 
 and then stirred, as if with returning sense. Quick as light- 
 ning, she was at his side ; she unlaced his helmet, nor did she 
 need to look at his pallid countenance to be assured of what 
 she already knew, that Eichard of England lay there, but for 
 her help, expiring. She filled his helm with water, and sprink- 
 ling it over him, he opened his eyes, and groaning again, strove 
 to clasp his head with his unnerved hand. With light fairy 
 fingers she released him from his coat of mail, and saw on his 
 right sight side a mass of congealed blood, which his faintness 
 had made cease to flow from his wound, bearing that it would 
 bleed again as he revived, she bound it with his scarf and her 
 own veil, and then gave him water to drink ; after which he 
 showed still more certain signs of recovery. 
 
 It was wonder to him to find himself alive, when already he 
 had believed the bitterness of death to be passed j still greater

THE CHALLENGE. 93 
 
 wonder was it to behold Lis own sweet Monina, like a spirit of 
 good, hovering over to recover him. He tried to raise himself, 
 and she bent down to support him, resting his head on her gentle 
 heart ; he felt its beating, and blest her with a thousand soft 
 thanks and endearing names. Though the wound in his side 
 was deep, yet now that the blood was staunched, it did not seem 
 dangerous. The immediate cause of his swoon was a stunning 
 blow on his head, which had beat in the iron of his helm, but 
 inflicted no further injury. It was long, however, before he 
 could move ; and the evening shades had made it almost night, 
 before he could sit his horse and slowly quit the wood. Wishing 
 to conduct him to where they might find succour, Monina 
 directed his steps to a village, east of the grove. They had 
 hardly ridden half a mile, when Eichard felt dizzy ; he faintly 
 called her to his side — she received him as he fell, and, support- 
 ing him to a bank, called aloud in agony, in hopes that some 
 wandering soldier or peasant might be near to aid them. It 
 happened to her wish ; several countrymen, who had been 
 carrying fruit to the Christian camp, passed them — she conjured 
 them, in the Virgin's name, to assist a soldier of the faith, a 
 crusader in their cause. Such an appeal was sacred in their 
 ears ; they contrived, with the poles and baskets in which they 
 had carried their fruit, covering them with a part of their habili- 
 ments and the saddle-cloths of the animals, to form a sort of 
 litter, on which they placed Richard. Monina followed on foot, 
 clasping his hand ; the men led the horses : and thus they pro- 
 ceeded up the mountains to a village about two leagues from 
 Granada, where every house was open to them. The prince was 
 permitted to repose in the habitation of the Alcalde, and the 
 deep sleep into which he soon fell was a dear assurance to his 
 friend's anxious heart, of the absence of danger, and a promise 
 of speedy recovery. 
 
 Yet tiie night that began so well with the patient, wore a less 
 prosperous appearance towards the conclusion. Monina sat 
 beside his couch, and perceived with alarm symptoms of pain 
 and fever. According to the custom of the time, she had 
 acquired some little skill in surgery ; this, when the wound 
 came to be dressed, made her acquainted with its irritated and 
 dangerous appearance. As the heat of the day came on, the 
 prince's sufferings increased. In this little village there was 
 neither physician nor medicaments necessary for the emergency; 
 and the place itself, low-built, hedged in by mountains, and 
 inhabited by peasants only, was ill suited for the patient. She 
 resolved that he should that night be removed to a town on the 
 eastern side of the mountains, overlooking the plain bordering

 the sea. A litter was prepared ; and she, fatigued by her 
 journey, and by lonnj and painful solicitude, yet walked beside 
 it, listening to his low breathin^^, catching the smallest sound 
 he made in complaint or questioning. Before she quitted the 
 A'illage, she employed a peasant to seek Plantagenet, and convey 
 to him intelligence of the actual state of his friends. 
 
 After three days of fear and anxious care, the wound began 
 to heal, and Eiehard became convalescent. Who could tell, 
 during the long hours that composed those days and nights, the 
 varying emotions that agitated poor Monina? That he should 
 die, was a thought in which, in its extent and reality, she never 
 indulged : but an awful fear of what of sufferincj the cominir 
 hours might produce, never for a moment slept within her. She 
 spent long intervals of time kneeling by his couch — her soft 
 fingers on his pulse, counting the rapid vibration — her cool hand 
 alon€ tempered the burning of his brow ; and often, supported 
 by her, he slept, while she remained in the same position, im- 
 movable. The very pain this produced was a pleasure to her, 
 since it was endured for him who was the idol of her innocent 
 and pure thoughts ; she almost lamented Avhen he no longer 
 needed her undivided attention : the hours she gave to repose 
 came like beggars following in a procession of crowned heads ; 
 they were no longer exalted by being devoted to him. 
 
 After the lapse of three anxious days he grew rapidly better, 
 and at evening-tide enjoyed at the open casement the thrilling 
 sweetness of the mountain air. How transporting and ineffable 
 are the joys of convalescence ! — the calm of mind — the volup- 
 tuous langour — the unrebuked abandonment to mere pleasurable 
 sensation — the delight that every natural object imparts, fill 
 those hours with a dream-like, faint ecstasy, more dear to 
 memory than tumultuous joy. Monina sat near him, and it was 
 dangerous for their young hearts thus to be united and alone in 
 a fairy scene of beauty and seclusion. Monina's ardent spirit 
 was entranced by delight at his recovery : no thought of self 
 mingled with the single idea that he was saved — saved for youth, 
 for happiness, and for his long-lost -rights. Darkness crept 
 around them, the clumps of chesnut trees grew more massy and 
 indistinct — the fire-fly was alive among the defiles of the hills — 
 the bat wheeled round their humble dwelling — the heavy-winged 
 owl swept with huge flapping wings out of the copse. " Are ye 
 here ? " were the first sounds that broke the silence ; it was the 
 voice of Edmund. Monina sprung up, and glad to disburthen 
 her full heart, welcomed with an embrace this beloved friend. 
 *' Guardian angel of our lives," he cried ; ** you are destined at 
 all times to save us ! " Dear, soothing expressions, which then,

 formed the joy, long afterwards tlie master-impulse of licr fervent 
 and devoted spirit. 
 
 Each told their tale ; the one of hazard and mischance, the 
 other of agonizing inquietude. For Eichard, Edmund had 
 feared; but when, wearied, terrified, and in despair, Lord Barry 
 had brought intelligence of Monina's disappearance from the 
 streamlet's side where he had left her, and of a distant view he 
 had caught of Moorish horsemen who took refuge in Granada — 
 heaven seemed at once to empty on him its direst curses, and his 
 fate was sealed with misery for ever. 
 
 The peasant dispatched by Monina had delayed ; not for 
 three days did he deliver her letter to Plantagenet, who still, 
 trembling in recollection of his past terror, and what might 
 have been the ultimate event of the prince's wound, departed on 
 the moment for . 
 
 And now farewell to Spain ! to romantic Spain, to Moorish 
 and Christian combat, to the gay fields of the Vega, to the 
 sunny mountains of Andalusia ! De Faro's caravel, true to its 
 appointment, arrived at Almeria. They embarked ; their imme- 
 diate destination was Lisbon ; but their thoughts were fixed on 
 the promised termination of their wanderings. Soon they 
 would. bend their course far away to the islands of the turbid 
 Northern sea, where nature veils herself in clouds, where war 
 assumes a sterner aspect, and the very virtues of the inhabit- 
 ants grow stubborn and harsh from the struggle they make to 
 be enabled to bear the physical ills of existence. 
 
 Farewell to Spain ! to boyhood's feats, to the light coursing 
 of shadows as he ran a race with the swift-footed hours. A 
 kingdom calls for Pachard ! the trials of life attend him, the 
 hope of victory, the fortitude of well-endured defeat.

 A THOUSAND recollections and forgotten tliou^jhts revived in 
 Ivichard's bosom when he saw his childhood's friend, the Lady 
 Brampton. He was reminded of his sufferings in the Tower, 
 of his noble cousin Lincoln, of her maternal tenderness, when 
 under her care he quitted the gloomy fortress, his brother 
 Edward's tomb. His mother's last embrace again thrilled 
 through his frame, and Lovel's parting blessing ; what sad 
 changes had chanced since last he saw her ! Sad in all, but 
 that he, then a boy, had sprung up into the riper age of youth- 
 ful prowess. 
 
 Even with the banished prince we must recur to the state of 
 affairs in the north of Europe. The French king, Charles the 
 Eighth, had directed all his attempts to the subjugation of 
 Britany, w^hich was now under the dominion of the youthful 
 Anne, its orphan duchess. The English nation espoused her 
 cause, watched with jealousy and indignation the progress of the 
 French arms, and clamoured loudly for war in her support. 
 Henry, on the contrary, was obstinately bent upon peace, 
 though he took advantage of his subjects' appetite for war, to 
 foist subsidies upon them, which were no sooner collected than 
 his armaments were disbanded, and an ambassador, sent on a 
 mission of peace, was substituted for the herald ready apparelled 
 for defiance. This could not last for ever. French policy 
 triumphed in the marriage of Charles the Eighth with Anne of 
 Britany ; and that duchy became finally annexed to the crown 
 of France. England was roused to indignation ; thekinij, forced 
 to listen to their murmurs, promised to invade the rival kingdom 
 the following spring ; a benevolence was granted him ; all his acts 
 tended to the formation of an expedition, which was the best 
 hope of York. 
 
 Lord Barry was urgent against delay, while the English

 partisans wished that E-ichard's landing in Ireland, and Henry's 
 ill France, shoukl be consentaneous. Na}^ they had deeper 
 vie\TS. Ireland, since Simnel's defeat, appeared but a forlorn 
 hope, and they fostered the expectation of being able to make 
 England itself the scene of their first attempt, so soon as its 
 king should be fairly engaged in hostilities on the other side of 
 the Channel. The d.uke himself, eager as he was to begin his 
 career, warmly supported this project; communication with the 
 North was slow meanwhile, and months wore away — not fruit- 
 lessly. Hichard gained in every way by the delay ; his know- 
 ledge of English aflfairs grew clearer; his judgment formed ; his 
 strength, weakened by the events of the summer, was restored 
 during the repose and salubrious coolness of the winter months. 
 
 Accident furthered their designs ; a visitor arrived from 
 England, who brought with him accounts so encouraging, that 
 hope blossomed into certainty in the hearts of the warm-hearted 
 followers of York. But ere we introduce this new and seemingly 
 important personage, we must return awhile to England, to speak 
 of Henry's suspicions, his fears, his artful policy. 
 
 All that Frion had achieved through his abortive attempt, had 
 been but to ascertain the existence of the duke of York, and to 
 spread still wider the momentous secret ; so that Henry, sus- 
 picious and irritated, received him on his return with anger, 
 resenting his failure as the result of treachery. Frion had been 
 dismissed ; and now years passed over, without the occurrence 
 of any circumstances that spoke of the orphan heir of the 
 English crown. The king brooded over the secret, but spoke of 
 it to no one. The royal youth grew to his imagination, as in 
 reality he did, passing from boyhood to almost man's estate. 
 Yet, when Henry reflected on the undisturbed state he had 
 enjoyed for years, on the firmness with which he was seated on 
 the throne, and the strong hold he had acquired through the 
 lapse of time on his subjects' minds, he sometimes thought that 
 even !Ri chard's friends would advise him to continue in an 
 obscurity, which was, at least, void of danger. Nevertheless, 
 whenever there had been a question of attacking France, the 
 feeling that his rival was ready to come forward, and that, 
 instead of a war of invasion, he might have to fight for his own 
 crown, increased his unwillingness to enter on the contest. 
 
 Now rumours were afloat — none knew whence they came, 
 from France or Ireland — of the existence of King Edward's 
 younger son, and that he would speedily appear to claim his suc- 
 cession. Henry, who was accustomed to tamper with spies and 
 informers, was yet the last to hear of a circumstance so nearly

 affecting liis interests. The name of Lady Brampton at lenoftli 
 reached him, as being abroad on a secret and momentous expedi- 
 tion. This namehadmade a considerable figure in Richard Simon's 
 confessions ; it was connected with Lincoln, Lovel, the dowager 
 queen, all whom the Tudor feared and hated. Yet he paused 
 before he acted ; his smallest movement might rouse a torpid 
 foe ; he only increased his vigilance ; and, from past experience 
 knowing that to be the weak point, he dispatched emissaries to 
 Ireland^ to learn if any commotion was threatened, any tale rife 
 there, that required his interference. As the time approached 
 when it was expected that the English prince would declare 
 himself, the policy of his friends greatly changed ; and, far from 
 maintaining their former mysterious silence, the circumstance of 
 his abode in Spain, and the expectation of his speedy appearance 
 in Ireland, made, during the winter of 1491-92, a principal topic 
 among such of the native nobility as the earl of Desmond had 
 interested in his cause. Henry's spies brought him tidings 
 beyond his fears ; and he saw that the struggle was at hand, 
 unless he could arrest the progress of events. Meanwhile, he 
 continued to defer his war with France ; he felt that that would 
 be the signal for his enemy's attack. 
 
 As he reflected on these things, a scheme developed itself in 
 his mind, on which he resolved to act. The enemy was distant, 
 obscure, almost unknown ; were it possible to seize upon his 
 person where he then was, to prevent his proposed journey to 
 Ireland, to prepare for him an unsuspected but secure prison — no 
 cloud would remain to mar his prospect; and, as to the boy 
 himself, he could hope for nothing better than his cousin War- 
 wick's fate, unless he had preferred, to the hazardous endeavour 
 of dethroning his rival, a private and innocuous life in the distant 
 clime where chance had thrown him. This was to be thought of 
 no more: already he was preparing for the bound, but ere he 
 made it, he must be crushed for ever. 
 
 In those times, when recent civil war had exasperated tlie 
 minds of men one against the other, it was no difficult thing 
 for a Lancastrian king to find an instrument willing and fitting 
 to work injury against a Yorkist. During Henry's exile in 
 Brittany, he had become acquainted with a man, who had 
 resorted to him there for the sole purpose of exciting him against 
 Hichard the Third ! he had been a favourite page of Henry the 
 SLxth, he had waited on his son, Edward, prince of Wales, that 
 noble youth whose early years promised every talent and virtue; 
 he had idolized the heroic and unhappy Queen Margaret. Henry 
 died a foul death in the Tower; the gracious Edward was

 stabbed at Tewkesbury ; tbe royal Margaret bad given place to 
 the widow Woodville ; while, through the broad lands of Eng- 
 land, the sons of York rioted in the full possession of her wealth. 
 Meiler Trangmar felt every success of theirs as a poisoned arrow 
 in his flesh — he hated them, as the mother may hate the tiger 
 whose tusks are red with the life-blood of her first-born — he 
 hated them, not with the measured aversion of a warlike foe, but 
 the dark frantic vehemence of a wild beast deprived of its young. 
 He had been the father of three sons ; the first had died at 
 Prince Edward's feet, ere he was taken prisoner ; another lost 
 his head on the scaffold ; the third — the boy had been nurtured 
 in hate, bred amid dire curses and bitter imprecations, all levelled 
 against Edward the Fourth and his brothers — his mind had 
 become distorted by the ill food that nurtured it — he brooded 
 over the crimes of these men, till he believed that he should do 
 a good deed in immolating them to the ghosts of the murdered 
 Lancastrians. He attempted the life of the king — was seized — 
 tortured to discover his accomplices : he was tortured, and the 
 father heard his cries beneath the dread instrument, to which 
 death came as a sweet release. Keal madness for a time possessed 
 the unhappy man, and when reason returned, it was only the 
 dawn of a tempestuous day, which rises on the wrecks of a gallant 
 fleet and its crew, strewn on the dashing waves of a stormy sea. 
 He dedicated himself to revenge ; he had sought Henry in 
 Brittany ; he had fought at Bosworth, and at Stoke. The 
 success of his cause, and the peace that followed, was at first a 
 triumph, at last almost a pain to him. He was haunted by 
 memories which pursued him like the hell-born Eumenides ; 
 often he uttered piercing shrieks, as the scenes, so pregnant with 
 horror, recurred too vividly to his mind. The priests, to whom 
 he had recourse as his soul's physicians, counselled him the 
 church's discipline ; he assumed the Franciscan habit, but found 
 sackcloth and ashes no refuge from the greater torture of his 
 mind. This man, in various ways, had been recalled to Henry's 
 mind, and now he selected him to effect his purpose. 
 
 To any other he would have feared to intrust the whole 
 secret ; but the knowledge that the destined victim was the son 
 and rightful heir of King Edward, would add to his zealous 
 endeavours to crush him. Besides that Trangmar had a know- 
 ledge of the fact, from having been before employed to extract in 
 his priestly character this secret from a Yorkist, Sir George 
 Nevil, who had been intrusted by Sir Thomas Broughton. Every- 
 thing yielded in this wretch's mind to his hatred of York ; and 
 lie scrupled not to hazard his soul, and betray the secrets of the

 confessional. ]S"eTil fortunately was informed in time of the 
 danger that menaced him, and had fled ; while Trangmar, 
 thunderstruck by the magnitude of his discovery, hastened to 
 reveal it to the king. It were long to detail each act of the crafty 
 sovereign, and his scarcely human tool. By his order, the friar 
 introduced himself to the dowager queen, at Bermondsey, with 
 a plausible tale, to which she, in spite of her caution, was induced 
 to give ear, and intrusted a message by him, as he said that he 
 was on his way to Spain, to seek and exhort to action the dilatory 
 prince. He then departed. Henry had rather to restrain than 
 urge his furious zeal. The scheme projected was, that Richard 
 should be entrapped on board a vessel, and brought with secrecy 
 and speed to England, where he might be immured for life in 
 some obscure castle in Wales. Trangmar promised that either 
 he would accomplish this, or that the boy should find a still more 
 secret prison, whence he could never emerge to disturb the reign 
 of Henry, or put in jeopardy the inheritance of his son. 
 
 Such was the man who, in the month of April, 1492, following 
 Lady Brampton's steps, arrived at Lisbon, and found to his wish 
 the prince there also, and easy access afibrded him to his most 
 secret counsels. He brought letters from the dowager queen, 
 and some forged ones from other partisans of York, inviting 
 the prince, without application to any foreign sovereigns, or aid 
 from distant provinces, at once to repair to England, and to set 
 up his standard in the midst of his native land, where, so these 
 letters asserted, the earl of Surrey and many other powerful 
 lords anxiously awaited him. All this accorded too well with 
 the wishes of the little conclave not to insure assent ; nay, more, 
 when Trangmar urged the inexpediency of the duke's being 
 accompanied by such notorious Yorkists as Plantagenet and Lady 
 Brampton, it was suddenly agreed that Bichard should embark 
 on board a merchantman, to sail with the next fair wind for 
 England, while his friends dispersed themselves variously for his 
 benefit. De Faro, in his caravel, was to convey Lord Barry to 
 Cork. Plantagenet resolved to visit the duchess of Burgundy, 
 at Brussels. Lady Brampton departed for the court of France, 
 to engage the king at once to admit young Eichard's claim, and 
 aid him to make it good. *' You, sweet, will bear me company;" 
 and Monina, her whole soul — and her eyes expressed that soul's 
 devotion to Eichard's success — remembered, starting, that the 
 result of these consultations was to separate her from her child- 
 hood's companion, perhaps, for ever. As if she had tottered on 
 the brink of a precipice, she shuddered ; but all was well again. 
 It WU3 not to be divided from the prince, to remain with Lady

 Brampton, to proceed to Paris with her ; on his earliest triumph 
 to make a part of it, and to join his court in London. All these 
 words, kin.i^, victory, and court, wove a golden tissue before the 
 ardent girl's eyes ; she had not yet 
 
 •' Lifted the painted veil which men call life ; " 
 
 as a child who chases the glories of the west, she knew not that 
 nii^ht was falling upon her, while still she fancied that she 
 advanced towards the ever-retreating splendour of the sky. 
 
 Lady Brampton and Plantagenet trembled, as they committed 
 their beloved charge to other hands ; they importuned Trangmar 
 with their injunctions — their entreaties, their thousand last 
 words of care and love — the friar heard, and smiled assent to 
 all. Moniua had need of all her courage for the hour, which 
 she knew not that she dreaded till it came. He was going ; the 
 truth flashed suddenly upon her — he, from whom since childhood 
 she had scarcely been absent for a day. So blind had she been 
 to her own sensations, that it was not until he leaped into the 
 boat, and put off from shore, that she became aware of the 
 overwhelming tide of grief, disquiet, almost of despair, that 
 inundated her heart. "Where was her gaiety, her light, ethereal 
 spirit flown ? Why lagged the hours thus ? Why did ceaseless 
 reverie seem her only refuge from intolerable wretchedness ? 
 
 She had one other solace ; she was still with his friends, 
 whose whole thoughts were spent upon him ; his name enriched 
 their discourse ; the chances of his voyage occupied their atten- 
 tion. Little knew they the strange and tragic drama that was 
 acting on board the skiff that bore afar the idol of their hopes.

 EiCHAED meanwliile sailed fearlessly, with treachery for his 
 nearest mate. Trangmar had at once exhibited audacity and 
 prudence in the arrangement of his plan. He had made no great 
 preparation, nor confided to any the real object of bis intents. 
 His only care had been, that the duke should sail on board an 
 English vessel ; and chance had brought into the Tagus one 
 whose captain was inclined to the party of Lancaster. He also 
 contrived to have two hirelings of his own engaged on board as 
 part of the crew, who knew that it was their employer's design 
 to carry to England a prisoner for the king. He was besides 
 provided with a warrant from Henry, empowering him to seize 
 on his rebel subject — the name a blank, for the monk to fill up — 
 alive or dead. The paper ran thus ; so, in case of struggle, to 
 afford warranty for his darker purpose. 
 
 E,ichard was now a prisoner. The vessel belonging to any 
 country is a portion of that country ; and the deck of this 
 merchantman was virtually a part of the British soil. The 
 prince, not heeding his position, was so far from fearing his 
 enemy's power, that he felt glad to find himself among his 
 countrymen. He looked on the weather-beaten countenances 
 of the honest sailors, and believed that he should find friends 
 and partisans in all. He spoke to Trangmar of his purpose of 
 declaring himself, and gaining them over ; making this tiny 
 offshoot of wide England his first conquest. Trangmar had not 
 anticipated this. He was ignorant of the versatile and active 
 spirit of the youth with whom he had to deal ; nor had he, by 
 putting himself in imagination in the prince's place, become 
 aware how the project of acquiring his own was his sleepless 
 incentive to every action, and how he saw in every event a

 stepping-stone in the prosecution of his enterprise. He started 
 at the proposal, and in his own heart said, '* I must lose no 
 time ; that which I thought to do next week, were better done 
 to-morrow." With Richard he argued against this measure: 
 he showed how the captain was bound to the present English 
 government by his fortunes ; how far more likely it was that, 
 instead of gaining him and his crew, he would be made a 
 prisoner by them, and delivered up to his enemy. Hichard lent 
 no great credence to this, but he yielded to the authority of the 
 elder and the priest. 
 
 . It was not in the power of his wily adversary to prevent him 
 from ingratiating himself in the hearts of all around him. 
 Besides his gentleness, his unaflfected sympathy, and noble 
 demeanour, his gay and buoyant spirit was congenial to the 
 reckless sailors, who, during the dead calm that succeeded their 
 first day's sail after quitting the Tagus, were glad of amusement 
 to diversify their monotonous lives. He interceded with their 
 captain when any fault was committed ; he learned their private 
 histories, promised his assistance, and scattered money among 
 them. Sometimes he called them around him to teach him their 
 art, discoursing about the stars, the magnet, the signs of the 
 weather ; he climbed the shrouds, handled the ropes, became an 
 adept in their nautical language. At other times he listened to 
 tales of dreadful shipwrecks and sailors' hardships, and recounted 
 in turn De Faro's adventures. This made them talk of the new 
 African discoveries, and descant on the wild chimeras or sage 
 conclusions of Columbus, who at last, it was said, was to be sent 
 by the sovereigns of Spain in quest of the western passage to 
 India, over the slant and boundless Atlantic. All this time, 
 with flapping sails, they lay but a short distance off the moutli 
 of the Tagus ; and Trangmar, impatient of delay, yet found it 
 prudent to postpone his nefarious purpose. 
 
 After the calm had continued for nearly a week, signs of bad 
 weather manifested themselves ; squalls assailed the ship, settling 
 at last in a gale, which grew into a tempest. Their little vessel 
 was decked, yet hardly able to resist the lashing waves of the 
 Bay of Biscay. A leak, which had shown itself even during the 
 calm, increased frightfully ; the men were day and night em- 
 ployed at the pumps, exposed to the beating rain, and to the 
 waves, which perpetually washed the deck, drenching their 
 clothes and bedding ; each hour the wind became more furious, 
 dark water-spouts dipping into the boiling sea, and churning it 
 to fury, swept past them, and the steep sides of the mountain- 
 high billows were ready at every moment to overwhelm them. 
 Their tiny bark, which in these days would scarcely receive a

 more dignified name than a skifF, was borne as a leaf on the stream 
 of the wind, its only safety consistinj^ in yielding to its violence. 
 Often at the worst the men despaired. The captain himself, 
 frightened at the danger — and, strange inconsistency, still more 
 fearful of the ruin that must attend him if his vessel were 
 wrecked — lost all presence of mind. The prince displayed, 
 meanwhile, all his native energy ; he commanded the men, and 
 they obeyed him, looking on him as a superior being ; when, by 
 following his orders, the progress of the leak was checked, and 
 the tossed bark laboured less among the surges. " Sailors have 
 short prayers," he said; "but if they are sincere ones, the saints 
 will not the less intercede for us before God. Join me, my men, 
 in a pious vow. I swear, by our Lady's precious name, to walk 
 barefoot to her nearest shrine the first land we touch, and there 
 to make a gift of incense and candles at her altar. This, if we 
 escape ; if not, here is Father Meiler, a holy Franciscan, to give 
 XLS short shrift; so that, like devout Catholics, we may recom- 
 mend our souls to the mercy of Jesus. And now to the pump, 
 the ropes ; bring me a hatchet — our mast must overboard." 
 
 Three days and nights they worked unremittingly ; the lull 
 that then succeeded was followed by another tempest, and the 
 exhausted mariners grew desperate. They had been borne far 
 into the Atlantic, and now the wind shifting, drove them with 
 the same fury into the Bay of Biscay. Every moment in 
 expectation of death, the heart of Trangmar softened towards 
 his victim in spite of himself; he was forced to admire his 
 presence of mind, his unvauquishable courage ; his light, yet 
 gentle spirit, which made him bear up under every difficulty, yet 
 pity those who sunk beneath, cheering them with accents at once 
 replete with kindness and fearless submission to the decree of 
 Providence. Feeling the crew bound to him as his natural 
 subjects, he extended towards them a paternal love, and felt 
 called upon to guard and save them. After, for a fortnight, they 
 had thus been the sport of the elements, the gale decreased ; the 
 violent breakers subsided into one long swell, which bore them 
 into a sheltered cove, in the wild coast that surrounds the Bay 
 of Biscay. The men disembarked, the vessel was drawn up ; all 
 hands were employed in unlading and repairing her. " Ye do 
 ill," said Kichard ; " do you not remember our vow ? Doubtless 
 some village is near which contains a shrine where we may pny

 This piety was in accord with the spirit of the times ; and tlie 
 men, rebuked, revered still more the j^outh who had saved them 
 in danger, and who now in safety paid, with religious zeal, the 
 debt inf^urred towards their heavenly patroness. A little village

 lay secluded near tlie creek, and above it, on a liigh rock, was a 
 chapel dedicated to Saint Mary of the Ascension, erected by a 
 noble, vrho had vowed such offering on escaping, as the prince of 
 England had, from death on those perilous seas. Bareheaded, 
 barefooted, bearing lights, following the Franciscan who led the 
 way, the crew of the St. George proceeded towards the shrine. 
 Next to the Blessed Virgin, Kichard claimed their gratitude; and 
 after due Aves had been said at the altar, still in the sacred place 
 they gathered round him, oflfering their property and their lives, 
 imploring him to accept from them some pledge of their thank- 
 fulness. The heart of the outcast sovereign swelled within him. 
 " I reign here, in their breasts I reign," was the thought that 
 filled his bright eyes with a dew springing from the fulness of 
 his soul. With a smile of triumph he looked towards Father 
 Meiler, as if to appeal to his judgment, whether now he might 
 not declare himself, and claim these men's allegiance. He was 
 startled by the dark and even ferocious expression of Trangmar's 
 countenance. His coarse brown Franciscan dress, belted in by a 
 rope ; the cowl thrown back, displaying the monkish tonsure ; 
 the naked feet : these were symbols of humility and Christian 
 virtue, in strong contrast with the deep lines of his face, and the 
 glare of his savage eyes. He met the glance of his victim, and 
 became confused, while the prince in wonder hastened to ask 
 what strange thoughts occupied him, painting his visage with 
 every sign of fierce passion. 
 
 *' I was thinking," said Trangmar, hesitating ; " I was de- 
 liberating, since God has cast us back on the land, whether it 
 were not wiser to continue our journey through France, bidding 
 farewell to the perils of the ocean sea ? " 
 
 " That will I not," cried the prince. " Father Meiler, I 
 watched you during the storm; you acted no coward's part 
 then ; why do you now ? " 
 
 " When danger is near, I can meet it as a man of courage," 
 said Trangmar; "when it is far, I can avoid it like a prudent 
 one." 
 
 "A good clerical distinction, fit for a monk," replied the 
 duke ; " but I, who am a cavalier, father, love rather to meet 
 danger, than to avoid it like a woman or a priest." 
 
 "Insulting boy ! " cried Meiler; "dare you taunt me with 
 cowardice ? That I was a soldier ere I was a monk, some of 
 your race dearly rued ! " 
 
 Before these words were fully uttered, Trangmar recollected 
 himself; his voice died away, so that his last expression was 
 inaudible. The duke only beheld his burst of passion and sudden 
 suppression of it, and said gently, " Pardon me, father ; it is my

 fault that you forgot tlie respect due to me. I forgot the 
 reverence meet from youth to age — most meet from a sinful boy 
 to a holy monk." 
 
 "I thank your highness," said the friar, "for recalling to my 
 memory a truth that had half escaped it. Henceforth be assured 
 that I -will not forget that you are the undoubted offspring of the 
 earl of March — of Edward of England." 
 
 Eate thus urged this wicked and miserable man to his fiend- 
 like purpose. Awakened again to deadly vengeance, he resolved 
 to delay no longer ; to trust no more to chance : he saw now all 
 the difficulties of his former scheme of taking his enemy a pri- 
 soner to England ; and this soothed his conscience as he recurred 
 to more fatal designs. During the short delay that intervened 
 before they again put out to sea, he watched an opportunity, 
 but found none. At length they weighed anchor ; and with a 
 favourable wind, bore down the coast of France. The time was 
 come, he surely thought : for during this long voyage he could 
 frame an opportunity ; during some dark night, when the ship 
 sailed cheerily before a fair breeze, he would engage the prince 
 in engrossing talk concerning the conduct he should pursue 
 when in England, taking advantage of his victim's incautious- 
 ness to allure him near the brink, and then push him overboard. 
 His single strength was more than a match for his slight adver- 
 sary ; but to render his scheme doubly sure, he would have the 
 two men in his pay near him, to assist, in the case of struggle, 
 and vouch for his innocence if he were accused of foul play. 
 
 It is the fortune of those hurried into crime by violent passion, 
 that they can seldom find accomplices as wicked as themselves. 
 Thus was it with Trangmar. The men whose assistance he relied 
 upon, the enthusiasm of their fellow-sailors for their noble pas- 
 senger. After they had again set sail, the wind blowing gently 
 from the south, bore them onwards with a favourable navigation, 
 till, shifting a few points eastward, it began to freshen. It was 
 then that the Franciscan, not wholly betraying his purpose, but 
 hinting that their presence would be necessary, ordered his men 
 to contrive that the rest of the crew should be below, and they 
 near at hand, while he that night should be alone with Eichard 
 upon deck. One of the men replied by stoutly declaring that if 
 any evil was threatened the prince, he would not be a party in 
 it. " You possess Xing Henry's warrant," he said, " to make 
 this Fitzroy a prisoner. I will not oppose his majesty's com- 
 mand. You have him safely ; what would you more ? " 
 
 The , other apparently yielded an assent to his employer's 
 commands, and then found a speedy opportunity to warn 
 Bichard of his danger A veil fell from the prince's eyes.

 *' Surely I knew this before," he thought ; *' ever since I was in 
 Saint Mary's Chapel, I must have known that this dastard 
 monk was my enemy. I am indeed betrayed, alone, friendless, 
 on board an English vessel, surrounded by an English crew. 
 Now let the trial be made, whether simple honesty be not of 
 more avail than cruelty and craft. But first let me fathom the 
 full intention of this man, and learn whether he have a worse 
 design than that of delivering me over defenceless to my adver- 
 sary. It cannot be that he would really murder me." 
 
 The breeze had rather sunk towards sunset, but it arose again 
 with the stars ; the vessel's prow struck against the light waves, 
 and danced gaily on through the sea. One man stood at the 
 helm; another, one of the friar's hirelings, loitered near; the 
 other kept out of the way. Still, beneath the thousand stars of 
 cloudless night, the little bark hurried on, feeling the freshening 
 of the wind ; her larboard beam was deep in the water, and 
 close at the deck's leeward edge, Meiler and his intended victim 
 paced. One thoughtless boy, high among the shrouds, whistled 
 in answer to the winds. There was at once solitude and activity 
 in the scene. " This is the hour," thought Hichard ; " surely if 
 man's sinful heart was ever touched with remorse, this man's may 
 now. God's throne, visible in all its beauty above us — beneath, 
 around, the awful roaring waters, from which we lately so mira- 
 culously escaped." He began to speak of England, of his 
 mother, of the hopes held out to him by his companion ; eager 
 in his desire of winning a traitor to the cause of truth, he 
 half forgot himself, and then started to find that, ever as he 
 walked, his companion got him nearer to the brink of the slant, 
 slippery deck. Seized with horror at this manifestation of the 
 worst designs, yet scarcely daring to credit his suspicions, he 
 suddenly stopped, seizing a rope that swung near, and steadying 
 himself by winding his arm round it, an act that escaped his 
 enemy's observation, for, as he did it, he spoke : " Do you know, 
 Father Meiler, that I suspect and fear you ? I am au inexpe- 
 rienced youth, and if I am wrong, forgive me ; but you have 
 changed towards me of late, from the kind friend you once were. 
 Strange doubts have been whispered : do you reply to them. 
 Are you my friend, or are you a treacherous spy ? — the agent of 
 the noble Yorkists, or Henry Tudor's hireling murderer? " 
 
 As he spoke, the friar drew still nearer, and the prince recoiled 
 farther from him : he got on the sheer edge of the deck. " Eash 
 boy ! " cried Trangmar, " know that I am no hireling : sacred 
 vengeance pricks me on ! Son of the murderer ! tell me, where 
 is sainted Henry ? where Prince Edward ? where all the noble 
 martyrs of his cause ? where my brave and lost sons ? There,

 even vrliere tlioii slialt be : quick, look back, thy grave yawns 
 for thee ! " 
 
 Witli the words he threw liimself furiously on the prince: the 
 stripling sprung back with all the force lent him by the rope he 
 held, and pushed at the same time Trangmar violently from him, 
 as he cried aloud on the sailors, " What, ho ! treason is among 
 us ! " A heavy splash of the falling Meiler answered his call : 
 the strong man was cast down in his very pride ; the waters 
 divided, and sucked him in. In a moment the crew were on 
 deck ; Trangmar's hireling, scared, cried out, *' He is King 
 Henry's prisoner ! seize him ! " thus increasing the confusion. 
 The friar, his garments floating, now appeared struggling among 
 the waves ; a rope was thrown to him ; the vessel sped on mean- 
 while, and it fell far short; Eichard, horror-struck, would have 
 leapt in to save his enemy ; but the time was gone. One loud 
 shriek burst on the ear of night, and all was still ; Trangmar, his 
 misery, his vengeance, and his crimes, lay buried in the ocean's 
 hoary caves. 
 
 What explanation could follow this tremendous incident? 
 The prince spoke of his life attacked ; the men of the warrant 
 their master had for his seizure : what was his crime none knew. 
 "That willldeclare freely, "'said the royal youth ; "that unhappy 
 man has sealed my truth by his death. In my childhood I was 
 nurtured in a palace, and bore the title of the duke of York. 
 Edward the Fourth was my father, Edward the Eifth my 
 brother." 
 
 " Why this is foulest treason," cried the trembling captain. 
 
 " Ay, or fairest loyalty ; speak, my friends ; which of you 
 will lay hands on your liege, on Hichard the Fourth of England ? " 
 
 The reckless and ignorant sailors, riotously and with one 
 acclaim, swore to die for him ; but their commander shuddered 
 at the peril that beset him : while his men were hanging round 
 their idolized prince, he retired with his mate to lament the ugly 
 chance of Trangmar's death, and to express terror at the very 
 name of York. If the captain was a coward-friend of Tudor, 
 the mate was a sturdy Lancastrian ; he recommended his chief 
 to seize the boy, and convey him a welcome gift to his sovereign ; 
 the clamours of the delighted crew showed that this was vain 
 advice. He had said to them, with all the ingenuousness of youth, 
 " My life is in your hands, and I know that it is safe." Yet, 
 when they spoke of seizing their unwilling commander, and of 
 delivering the vessel in his hands, he said, " My good friends, I 
 will not make lawless acts the stepping-stones to my throne ; it 
 is grief enough for me that my young hands have unwittingly 
 destroyed the life of one who, not as an armed knight, but in

 Iloly p;arb set himself against me. I mj'self T^-ill persuade your 
 captain to do me all the service I require." 
 
 This poor man was willinf^ enough to hear what he called rea- 
 son ; at first he would fain have entreated Richard to suffer 
 himself to be carried a prisoner to England ; and, when he found 
 his discourse vain, he yielded timid obedience to York's wishes, 
 in spite of the lowering brow of his mate : thus, at least, his 
 cargo would be saved, and liis crew preserved from mutiny. 
 Richard simply requested to be set on shore in Cork harbour, 
 suddenly relinquishing every thought of England, now that he 
 saw the treachery that awaited him there, and recurring to the 
 former plans of Lord Barry. In Ireland, in the county of the 
 Desmonds, he should find friends, adherents, almost prepared 
 for his arrival ; and there also, if Barry forgot not his promise, 
 this stanch partisan would speedily join him : the captain 
 gladly assented to any project that did not force him to land 
 this dangerous pretender on the English shores. 
 
 For one week they ran before the wind ; and Ireland, far and 
 low, was discernible on the horizon ; the dear land of promise to 
 the weary exile, the betrayed, but high-hearted prince : during 
 this short navigation it had required all his fortitude to banish 
 from his mind the image of the friar struggling in the waves, of 
 a man precipitated in the very act of crime " unhouseled, \in- 
 anointed, unannealed," into the life-quenching waters. Besides 
 all other expectations, Eichard longed to get on shore, that in a 
 confessional he might lift this burthen of involuntary guilt from 
 his soul. 
 
 At length the iron-bound coast was right ahead; the pon- 
 derous rocky jaws of the creek were open, and they sailed up 
 Passage, past beautiful and woody islands, under forest-crowned 
 hills, till they cast anchor before the picturesque and hill-set city 
 of Cork, whose quay was crowded by multitudes, gazing on the 
 newly-arrived vessel. 
 
 The duke of York stood on the prow of his skiff, reflecting on 
 the first step he ought to take. He knew little of- Ireland, and 
 that little had been gleaned from Lord Barry : he heard from 
 him of its warlike chiefs, its uncivilized septs, and English 
 settlers, scarce less wild, and quite as warlike as its aboriginal 
 inhabitants. He called to mind the names most famihar to him — 
 the earl of Kildare, abettor of Simnel, pardoned by Henry, and 
 continued in his ofiice of Lord Deputy ; the earl of Desmond, 
 whom Lord Barry had particularly interested in his favour, wha 
 affected the state of an Irish chieftain, or rather king, and who, 
 in his remote abode in Munster, disdained to attend the Dubhn 
 parhament, or to make one of the lawful governors of the land,

 Other names he remembered of less note : Plunket, the lord 
 chief justice, -whom, with infinite rehictance, Henry had 
 pardoned ; Keatinj^, prior of Kilmainham, who had been 
 constable of Dublin Castle, and who, ejected from his office after 
 the battle of Stoke, had saved himself by flight, and was now 
 concealed in an abbey near Buttevant. Much, however, of 
 what he had heard, escaped his memory ; and he stood on tlie 
 threshold of this unknown land, vainly seeking in his recollection 
 for the dim and shadowy forms which were to guide him in the 
 new and unexplored world before him. Another reflection also 
 presented itself: Lord Barry had quitted Ireland the year before, 
 and communication there had been none since then — Was Kildare 
 still deputy ? did incursions of the natives, or turbulence among 
 themselves, occupy the lords of the Pale ? Should he find a 
 band of nobles and their followers ready to assist him, or the 
 motley population of a barbarous wild, whose sole ideas were 
 internal struggles for power, whose watchwords for enterprise 
 were names and things in which he had no portion ? 
 
 In a hurried manner, York resolved on his plan of action. He 
 had, on their approach to land, arrayed himself in gay and rich 
 apparel. The Spain from which he came was parent of this act: 
 there embroidery, housings inlaid with gold, and arms encrusted 
 with jewels, formed the pride of the high-born cavaliers. He 
 stood prepared to land ; he thanked the captain for his enforced 
 courtesy ; he held out his hand to the crew, who gathered round 
 him with their prayers and blessings. " My own ! " was his 
 first thought as he set his foot on shore : " Hail, realm of my 
 fathers ! Hear the vow of the fugitive who claims your sway ! 
 Justice, mercy, and paternal love, are the gifts with which I 
 will repay your obedience to my call ; your submission to my 
 rule." 
 
 " Heave the anchor, and away ! " thus spoke the captain of 
 the craft he had left. 
 
 " For England ; to warn our king of this springal's insolent 
 presumption," said the mate. 
 
 " To ,'\ny quarter of the wide world, save England," replied 
 the timid captain : " "Would you have me run my neck into the 
 noose for not having clapped under hatches this mercurial spark ? 
 Master mate, learn from an old sailor, that the best you can do 
 with kings and grandees, is to have nought to do with them."

 Cork was an asylum for civilization in the centre of a savage 
 district. The cautious burghers, made wealthy by trade, and 
 ever in fear of incursions from the surrounding septs, kept the 
 strictest guard upon their city, as if they had a continual siege 
 laid to it. They forbade all intercourse or intermarriage between 
 those within and without the walls, till every citizen became 
 linked together by some sort of kindred. It is true, that the 
 country around was peopled to a great degree by English lords ; 
 but they were the degenerate English, as they were styled, who 
 imitated the state and. independence of the native chiefs. Such 
 was the earl of Desmond, of the family of the Geraldines, who 
 ruled as a king over Munster, and with whom the Barrys, the 
 De Courcys, the Barrets, and the Mac Carthys, Mac Swineys, 
 and other native chiefs, were connected by marriage, or struggling 
 with him for " chieferie " in the mutable chance of war. 
 
 There was no appearance of timidity in the frank and assured 
 aspect of the unfriended adventurer, as, without entering the city, 
 but merely passing through its suburbs, he proceeded to the 
 cathedral church. It was twelve o'clock on the 24th of June, 
 the feast of Saint John the Baptist ; and high mass was cele- 
 brating. The duke of York entered the church — his soul was 
 filled with pious gratitude for his escape from the dangers of the 
 sea, and the craft of his enemies ; and, as he knelt, he made a 
 vow to his sainted patroness, the Virgin, to erect a church on 
 the height which first met his eyes as he approached shore, and 
 to endow a foundation of Franciscans — partly, because of all 
 monkish orders they chiefly venerate her name, partly to atone 
 for his involuntary crime in the death of Meiler Trangmar, who 
 wore that habit. The appearance of this young, silken-suited,

 and Laudsome cavalier, drew the eyes of Erin's blue-eyed 
 daughters : — tlie men whispered together that he must be some 
 Spanish grandee or English noble ; but wherefore, unannounced 
 and unattended, he came and knelt in their charch before the 
 shrine of Saint Finbar, was matter of vague conjecture. The 
 congregation passed out ; then, impelled by curiosity, formed a 
 wide semicircle round the gates of the cathedral, watching the 
 motions of the graceful stranger. Master John Lavallan, the 
 mayor, John O'Water, the wealthiest citizen, and former mayor 
 of the town, and other rich burghers, stood close to the Eound 
 Tower within the walls of the Garth, in expectation of being 
 addressed by their distinguished visitor. The duke of York 
 cast a quick glance around ; and then, as the mayor advanced, 
 tlie youth stepped forward to meet him. The citizen, as one 
 habituated to exercise hospitality, bade the knight welcome, 
 beseeching him to honour his abode with his presence, and to 
 command his services. The duke frankly accepted the invitation, 
 and descended with the mayor into the main street, where that 
 officer resided ; and here again Bichard was made welcome to 
 the city of Cork. 
 
 It was a gala day at the mayor's ; and now, at the dinner hour, 
 twelve o'clock, the long tables groaned under the weight of 
 viands, and round the hospitable board were seated the principal 
 families of the town. No questions were asked the visitor — his 
 golden spurs bespoke his honourable rank ; he was placed at the 
 right hand of Lavallan ; and, while the clatter of knives and 
 trenchers went on, he was only remarked by the younger guests, 
 wjio gazed, even to the injury of their appetites, on his burnished 
 ringlets, his fair open brow, his bright blue eyes, and smile of 
 courteous affability : but time went on ; the dishes were carried 
 away, the goblets placed ; when the mayor, rising, drank welcome 
 to the stranger, and asked, if no reason forbade him to reply, his 
 name and mission. Already Richard had become acquainted 
 with most of the countenances of his entertainers — that is, of 
 those nearest him ; for, far through the long hall, almost out of 
 sight, the table extended, crowded by city retainers, and a few 
 of the mere " Irishry," whose long hair and loose saffron- 
 coloured mantles contrasted with the doublet, hose, and trimmed 
 locks of the townsmen. Those near him bore the latter character, 
 though their vivacious glances and quick gestures were more 
 akin to the inhabitants of the south, among whom he had been 
 accustomed to live, than to the steady, dull demeanour of 
 English traders. 
 
 When Lavallan drank to the stranger, every eye turned to the 
 object of the toast, Bichard arose— his plumed cap was doffed j

 his sliining hair, parted on Lis brow, clustered round his throat ; 
 his sunny countenance was full of confidence and courage — " Sir 
 Mayor," he said, " my most kind entertainer, and you, my 
 friends, men of Cork, may the grateful thanks of the homeless 
 adventurer be as kindly received by you, as they are gladly paid 
 by him. Who am I? you ask. Wherefore do I comeP My 
 name is the best in the land ; my coming is to claim your aid, to 
 elevate it to its rightful place of pride and honour. Were I 
 craven-hearted, or you less generous, I might dread to declare 
 myself ; but fear never entered the heart of a Plantagenet ; and, 
 when, unreservedly, I place my life in your hands, will you 
 betray the trust ? " 
 
 A murmur quickly hushed, the sound of suppressed emotion, 
 as the winds of thought passed over the minds of those around, 
 for an instant interrupted the speaker — 
 
 *' Neither is my name nor lineage unknown to you," he con- 
 tinued : " you honour both and have obeyed them ; will you 
 refuse to submit to me, their descendant and representative ? 
 Did you not vow fealty to Riichard duke of York, who, driven 
 from his own England by false Lancaster, found refuge and 
 succour here? Was not Clarence your ruler, and Edward of 
 England monarch of your isle ? In the name of these, in the 
 name of the White E-ose and Mortimer and Plantagenet — I, the 
 son of Edward the Fourth, the victim of my uncle Gloster's 
 treachery, and low-born Tudor's usurpation ; I, named in my 
 childhood duke of York and lord of Ireland, now, if rightly 
 styled, Eichard the Fourth of England, demand my lieges of 
 Cork to acknowledge my rights, to rise in my cause. I, a 
 prince and an outcast, place myself in their hands, through them 
 to be a fugitive for ever, or a king." 
 
 Had Eichard planted this scene, with deep insight into the 
 dispositions of those with whom he had to deal, he could not 
 have projected a better arrangement. They had learned of his 
 existence from Lord Barry, and were prepossessed in his favour. 
 Their fiery hearts were lighted at the word — his name, with 
 a thousand blessings attached to it, rang through the hall : by 
 means of the servants and followers at the lower end of the 
 table, it reached the outer apartments and avenues of the 
 mansion-house ; while, with a kind of exalted rapture, the 
 mayor and his guests hung over their new-found prince. The 
 citizens began to gather without, and to call aloud for the White 
 Eose of England ; the day was finished in festal tumult ; the 
 mayor led forth his princely visitor — he was hailed lord of 
 Ireland with one acclaim. Some elders, who had known his 
 grandfather, or had been followers of the duke of Clarence, and

 others wlio, visiting England, had seen Edward the If JrL^th 
 were struck by tlie likeness he bore to his. progenitors, and 
 entlnisiastieally Touched for his truth. To see and hear the mad 
 exultation of the moment, an uninterested spectator must have 
 thought that a messenger from heaven had arrived, to bestow 
 liberty on the groaning slaves of some blood-nurtured tyrant. 
 The duke was installed in the castle with princely state, a town- 
 guard appointed him, and the night was far advanced, before he 
 was permitted to repose, and wondering to collect his thoughts, 
 and feel himself an acknowledged sovereign in the first town of 
 his alienated dominions in which he had set foot. 
 
 The morrow brought no diminution to the zeal of his partizans. 
 The first measure of the day was his attending high mass, sur- 
 rounded by the mayor and citizens ; when the holy ceremony was 
 finished, he took oath on the Gospels, that he was the man he had 
 declared himself. The eager people clamoured for him to assume 
 the name of king ; but that he said he would win with his good 
 sword, nor, till he possessed its appanage, assume a barren title: 
 he was the duke of York, until at Westminster he received his 
 paternal crown. 
 
 Erom the church the mayor and citizens attended liis council 
 at the Castle, and here Eicbard more fully explained to them the 
 projects of Lord Bariy, his hopes from the earl of Desmond, and 
 his wish to attach to his cause the earl of Kildare, Lord Deputy 
 of Ireland. He learned the changes that had taken place 
 but a month or two before : some suspicion having entered 
 Henry's mind, the earl of Kildare had been dismissed from his 
 high oflice, and Walter, archbishop of Dublin, substituted in his 
 room. The baron of Portlester, who had been treasurer for 
 forty years, was obliged to resign in favour of a Butler, heredi- 
 tary and bitter enemies of the G-eraldines, while the exaltation of 
 Plunket, from the ofiice of chief justice to that of chancellor, only 
 proved that he was entirely gained over to the Lancastrians. 
 The acts of this new government tended to mortify the late 
 deputy, who bore ill his own degradation and the triumph of his 
 enemies. On various occasions brawls had ensued ; and when 
 Sir James of Ormond wished to place a creature of his own in a 
 castle over which Kildare claimed seignory, the latter defended 
 it by arms. This turbulent state of things promised fair for the 
 adventurer: and his first deed was to despatch letters to the 
 earls of Kildare and Desmond, sohciting their assistance, setting 
 forth the ready zeal of the city of Cork, and the promises 
 and attachment of Lord Barry, whom he daily expected to see 
 arrive. 
 
 In all that the English prince did, nothing spoke louder for

 him to Lis Irish friends than his fearless confidence, and 
 artless, yet not undignified reliance on their counsels. He had 
 gained a warm friend in the former mayor, O'Water, a man 
 reverenced throughout Munster. In his youth he had served in 
 the army, and his spirit was hardly yet tamed to the pacific 
 habits of a burgher. He was sixty years of age ; but he bore 
 his years lightly, and remembered but as the occurrence of 
 yesterday the time when the duke of York, grandfather of 
 young Kichard, was lord of Ireland. He had attached himself 
 particularly to his person, and followed him to England, return- 
 ing to his own country after his patron's death. He saw in the 
 descendant of his chief, his rightful lord, to refuse obedience to 
 whom was a sin against the laws of God and man. He fervently 
 swore never to desert him, and despatched emissaries on all sides 
 to spread the tidings of his arrival, and excite the partizans of 
 the White Eose to his active assistance. 
 
 When the letters were written, council held, and a course of 
 conduct determined, on, still the caravel of De Faro did not 
 appear, and Eichard grew weary of his state of indolence. A 
 week passed ; and during the second, at the conclusion of which, 
 the answers from the noble chieftains were expected, the duke of 
 York announced to O'Water his intention of visiting Buttevant, 
 the seat of Lord Barry, where, in the Abbey of Ballybeg, he 
 hoped to find the abbot of Kilmainham ; a man who, in exile 
 and poverty, exercised great influence over the Irish Yorkists. 
 He had been insolent and cruel towards his enemies when in 
 power, but he was endowed with popular qualities for his fol- 
 lowers ; while among his friends, he was valued for his boldness, 
 sagacity, and undaunted courage. His career had been turbulent; 
 he had supported himself against his sovereign by acts of lawless 
 violence, till, obliged at last to yield, he found himself, in his old 
 age, a poor brother in a distant monastery, obliged, for safety's 
 sake, to veil his lofty pretensions in the obscurest guise. Lord 
 Barry had offered him an asylum in the Abbey of Ballybeg ; 
 venerating, with the blind admiration of a soldier, the learning 
 and craft of the priest, conjoined, as it here was, to dauntless 
 courage. O'Water, on the contrary, disliked the subtle prior, 
 and endeavoured to dissuade the prince from the journey ; but 
 he spurned the city laziness, and in spite of his friends' entreaties, 
 and their fears for his safety among the followers of Desmond, 
 Barry, and Macarthy, departed on his intended visit, attended 
 only by Hubert Burgh, the foster-brother of Lord Barry. 
 
 The way from Cork to Buttevant was not far, but more 
 desolate than Granada during the Moorish .war. Summer and 
 the sun adorned that smiling land, casting a verdurous mantle

 over her deep wounds, painting the rude visage of war with 
 brilliant hues. The forests, dark hills, and uncultivated wilds of 
 Munster, showed nakedly the deep traces of the sovereign ill. But 
 lately this neighbourhood had been the seat of war between the 
 earl of Desmond and the chief of the Macarthys : the latter had 
 iallen in battle, but his brother and Tanist had succeeded to him, 
 and was already gathering together his sept for a more desperate 
 struggle. Never in Spain had Kichard seen such wild, strange 
 figures, as crossed his path during this short journey ; whether 
 it were the native kern, wrapt in his mantle, disguised by his 
 glibh, or long shaggy hair, or the adherents of Desmond, who 
 afiected the state of an Irish chieftain, whose leather-quilted 
 jackets, long saflfron-coloured shirts, cloaks and shaggy mustachios, 
 riding without stirrups, bearing spears, formed objects not less 
 uncouth and savage ; the very women bore a similar appearance 
 of incivilization. And as a comment on such text, Burgh told, 
 as they rode, the history of the late wars of Desmond with 
 O 'Carrol, prince of Ely, and with Macarthy ; and, a still more 
 dread tale, the incursion of Murrogh-en-Eanagh, an O'Brien ; 
 who, rising first in Clare, spread through the country, over- 
 running Munster, and bold from success, advanced into eastern 
 Leinster. All these accounts of battle were interwoven with 
 tales of feuds, handed down from father to son, of the natural 
 hatred of the native chiefs to the lords of English origin ; 
 interspersed with such strange wild tales, where the avowedly 
 supernatural was intermingled with deeds of superhuman prowess 
 and barbarity, that the English-born prince, nursling of romantic 
 Spain, felt as if he were transplanted into a new planet, and 
 stopped the speaker at each moment, to obtain some clearer 
 explanation, or to have interpreted words he had never before 
 heard, the names of customs and things found only in this land. 
 Thus entertained, the way to Buttevant, or as the Irish called 
 it, Kilnemullagh, which was about twenty miles, seemed short. 
 One thing was evident in all these details, that it was easy to 
 rouse the English lords in Ireland to any act of turbulence and 
 revolt ; biit that it would be difiicult nevertheless for their ill- 
 armed followers, and undisciplined bands, to compete with the 
 soldiery of England.

 Sisters, I from Ireland came. 
 
 Coleridge. 
 
 The duke, immediately on his arrival at the Castle of Buttevant, 
 despatched Hubert Burgh to the prior of Kilmainham, with a 
 message from himself and a token from Lord Barry, announcing 
 his intention of visiting him at the abbey the next day. But 
 Keating feared thus to draw the eyes of some enemy upon him, 
 and appointed a meeting in a secluded dell, near the bank of the 
 Mullagh, or Awbeg, the river which Spenser loves to praise. 
 Early in the morning Eichard repaired alone to this rural 
 presence-chamber, and found Xeating already there. Hearing 
 of the priest's haughty pride, Richard, with a sensation of 
 disgust, had figured a man something like the wretched Trang- 
 mar, strong of limb, and with a ferocious expression of coun- 
 tenance. Keating appeared in his monk's humble guise ; his 
 light eyes were still lively, though his hair and beard were 
 snowy white ; his brow was deeply delved by a thousand lines ; 
 his person short, slender, bent ; his step infirm ; his voice was 
 silver-toned ; he was pale, and his aspect in its lower part sweetly 
 serene. Richard looked with wonder on this white, withered 
 leaf — a comparison suggested by his frail tenuity ; and again 
 he almost quailed before the eager scrutiny of the prior's eye. 
 A merchant at a Moorish mart he had seen thus scan a slave he 
 was about to purchase. At length, with a look of great satisfac- 
 tion, the monk said, " This fits exactly ; our friends will not 
 hesitate to serve so goodly a gentleman. The daughter of 
 York might in sooth mistake thee for a near kinsman. Thou 
 comest from Portugal, yet that could not have been thy native 
 place?" 
 
 Richard started. This was the first time he had heard an 
 expression of doubt of his veracity. How could he reply ? His 
 word alone must support his honour ; his sword must remain 
 sheathed, for his injurer was a priest. Keating caught his

118 NEW ^IllENDS. 
 
 haughty glance, and perceived his mistalre. It was with an 
 effort that he altered his manner, for he exchanged with pain a 
 puppet subject to his will, for a man (prince or pretender) who 
 had objects and a state of his own to maintain. " Pardon the 
 obscure vision of an old man," he said ; *' my eyes were indeed 
 dim not to see the true marlrs of a Plantagenet in your appearance. 
 I was but a boy when your princely grandsire fell ; nor has it 
 been my fortune to visit England or to see your royal father. 
 But the duke of Clarence honoured me with his friendship, and 
 your cousin De la Poole ackowledged my zeal in furthering 
 his projects. I am now neither prior nor commander ; but, 
 poor monk as I am become, I beseech your highness to com- 
 mand my services." 
 
 This swift change of language but ill satisfied the pri.le of 
 Eichard, and in reply, he briefly recounted such facts as estab- 
 lished his right to the name he claimed. The noble artlessness 
 of his tone conquered the priest's lurking suspicions : in a more 
 earnest manner he besought the duke's pardon ; and a cordial 
 intercourse was established between them. 
 
 The place where they met was secluded and wild ; a bower 
 of trees hid it from the view of the river, and an abrupt rock 
 sheltered it behind. It was apparently accessible by the river 
 only, and it was by its bank that the duke and prior had arrived. 
 Nothing could equal the picturesque solitude around them. The 
 waving of the leafy boughs, the scream of the water-fowl, or the 
 splashing they made as they sprung from among the sedge and 
 darted across the stream, alone interrupted the voiceless calm ; 
 yet, at every moment, in his speech, Keating stopped, as if 
 listening, and cast his keen eyes, which he libelled much in calling 
 dim, up the steep crag, as if among its herbage and shrubs some 
 dreaded spy or expected messenger might appear. Then again 
 he apologized to the duke for having selected this wild spot for 
 their interview. A price, he observed, had been set upon his 
 head, and his only safety lay in perpetual watchfulness and 
 never-sleeping caution. " My zeal in your highness's cause," 
 he added, with a courtier smile, " cannot be deem.ed a strange 
 frenzy, since your success will not only assure my restoration to 
 the dignity of which I have been unjustly deprived, but prevent 
 an old man from perpetually dreaming of the sword of the slayer, 
 or the more frightful executioner's axe." 
 
 Again the prior fixed his eyes on a fissure in the rock, adding, 
 ** I had oppointed to meet one in this place before your message 
 was communicated to me — and in good time ; for, methinks, the 
 object of your visit may be furthered by the intelligence I hope 
 soon to receive. Your highness must have heard at Cork of the

 Trar carried on by the ^reat earl of r>esraond and a native se<pfc 
 of this region. Macarthy, their chief, fell duriuor the struggle, 
 but his successor and Tanist mustered his broken forces to 
 avenge him. The earl is impatient of this resistance, for his 
 presence is necessary in Thomond to drive the O'Carrols from 
 that district. At his invitation he and Macarthy meet this day 
 to parley but a few miles hence. I was to have made one among 
 them ; but a boding raven told me that danger was abroad." 
 
 The tidings of the near presence of the earl of Desmond were 
 unexpected, and most welcome to the duke. He immediately 
 resolved not to lose the golden hour. He eagerly asked where 
 the meeting was to be, and how speedily he might reach the 
 spot. 
 
 As he was thus earnestly expressing his desire, a slight rustling' 
 caught the prior's eaT : he looked up ; a human form hovered as 
 in mid-air, scarcely, as it were, alighting on the precipitous rock ; 
 quickly, but cautiously, it threaded its steep and tortuous path. 
 A large mantle was wrapt round the mountaineer, a large white 
 kerchief enveloped the head in the manner of a turban, yet the 
 prince caught the outline of a female figure, which soon des- 
 cended to the little plain on which they stood, and advanced 
 towards them ; she was evidently very young, but weather-worn 
 even in youth : her wild, picturesque dress concealed the pro- 
 portions of her form ; her large white sleeves hid her arm, but 
 the emaciated appearance of her face and hands, and bare feet, 
 struck Hichard with pity. She seemed astonished at seeing 
 him, and spoke to his companion in the language of the country, 
 which he did not understand : the prior's face darkened as she 
 spoke : there dwelt on it a mixture of disappointment and 
 ferocity, of which it could hardly have been deemed capable by 
 one who had hitherto seen it only bland and smiling ; swiftly, 
 however, he dismissed these indications of passion, and addressed 
 the prince calmly. " I cannot go," he said ; " my time is still to 
 be deferred, though it shall not be for ever lost. How does vour 
 courage hold ? if you are not afraid of going alone with a guide 
 whose very dialect is a mystery to you, through a country torn 
 by opposing factions ; if you do not fear presenting yourself 
 friendless to a haughty noble, who deems himself sovereign in 
 this domain, I will contrive that, ere four hours elapse, you shall 
 find yourself in Desmond's presence." 
 
 " Fear ! " the prince repeated. His eye glanced with some 
 contempt on the priest's cowl, which alone could suggest pardon 
 for such a thought ; yet he checked himself from any angry 
 disclaiming of the accusation, as he said, " Whatever in my 
 presumption I may hope, sage forethought tells me that I walk

 a road strewn with a thousand dangers, leading, it may be, to an 
 early death. Not for that will I deviate one furlong from my 
 'path. Sir Prior, where is the guide you promise ? " 
 
 Xeating, after a few minutes' reflection, instead of replying, 
 conversed again with the girl, and then addressed the duke : 
 *' This hapless child is a victim of the wars ; she was born far 
 hence, and is the last surviving of my foster-sister's once bloom- 
 ing family. Her mother saved my life. This child, barefoot as 
 she is, guided me hither. Is not a Keating fallen, when he 
 cannot give succour to an offspring of his fosterer's house? 
 Ind she, poor girl ! she has walked' far for me to-day ; but she 
 
 ill not slacken in her toil when I bid her proceed. She shall 
 o your guide, and your grace may rely upon her ; the dog you 
 led from its birth were less faithful. Now, at the hour of noon, 
 Desmond meets Macarthy of Muskerry, on Ballahourah. But 
 for the bogs and streams that cross your path, it is not far ; at 
 the worst, you can reach Mallow, where the earl will lie to-night. 
 It is best not to delay ; for, if there is peace in Munster, very 
 speedily Desmond will be on his way to Thomond." 
 
 This was a fresh spur to Eichard. He accepted the proffered 
 guide, who listened attentively to Keating's instructions given in 
 her native tongue. He followed the girl but a short distance ere 
 he looked back; the prior was gone; the solitude of the wild 
 crags and shrubs alone met his eye. Meanwhile his companion 
 stepped forward, motioning him to follow. They plunged into 
 the brake ; the sun rose high ; the birds winged their glad flight 
 among the trees. Now toiling up a steep, now wading a stream, 
 now entangled in a thicket, now stepping lightly over boggy 
 earth : now meditating on Andalusia, and now wondering at his 
 present position, Eichard followed his swift and silent guide 
 through the wild country between Buttevant and Mallow. 
 
 Already the meeting between the earl of Desmond and 
 Macarthy, the chief of Muskerry, was at an end. They parted 
 with fair words and exasperated thoughts. The native lord 
 could ill brook the settler's haughty assumptions ; nor Geraldine 
 endure the obstinate pride of the conquered native. Still their 
 relative positions enforced a peace. 
 
 They had separated, and after a hasty repast, spread on the 
 heathy side of Ballahourah, the earl proceeded towards Mallow. 
 He was surrounded by warriors, who all claimed the Geraldine 
 name, and who variously distinguished themselves as the White 
 Kniglit, the Knight of Kerry, and the Knight of the Glen. 
 There was Lord Fermoy, his father-in-law, and others of the 
 Eoches. Nor did all the native chiefs absent themselves. One 
 sister of the earl had married Macarthy Eeagh j another, an

 O'Brien, whose daughter liad intermarried with an O'CarroU — 
 all this in defiance of the English law, which forbade such 
 alHances, through which, the father of the present earl was 
 beheaded in the year 1467. Their antique costume, tight truise, 
 saffron tunics, and flowing robes, distinguished them froni the 
 Saxons ; yet these had not followed the fashions of the times, 
 but dressed in the garb used by the courtiers of Edward the 
 Third. 
 
 Maurice, tenth earl of Desmond, was brave even to a proverb. 
 He loved war, and deemed himself rather king of Desmond, 
 than a chief of English descent. To extend and secure his 
 possessions, rendering them at once independent of his sove- 
 reign and of the native chieftains, was the aim of his life. He 
 now meditated the invasion of Thomond ; but Macarthy's angry 
 demeanour showed that he must not be left unchecked in his 
 rear. " Where is my cousin Barry — where the lord of But- 
 tevant — the chief of the Barrymores ? Elying before a slip of 
 parchment indited in far London, as if my s\rord held not better 
 sway in these regions than a Parliament attainder ! Were he 
 here, the O'CarroUs should hear the thunder of my arrps ere 
 this moon waned. Muskerry could make no gathering in the 
 vales, while Barry sat on his perch at Buttevant." 
 
 The earl had time to waste in thought, as he was borne along 
 — at the age of fifteen, pushing rashly forward in an assault, he 
 received a wound in his leg, which lamed him for life, so that 
 he was carried about in a litter, and went by the name of 
 Claudus ; yet he was not deemed the less an experienced and 
 gallant warrior. With the virtues of a chieftain he possessed 
 the defects : Munster was his world ; his universe was peopled 
 by the Geraldines, the Macarthys, the Barrys, Donegans, Bar- 
 retts, Eoches, O'Briens, O'Carrolls, and the rest ; he disdained 
 his noble brethren of the pale. He considered it a mark of 
 distinction to be exempted by a law from attendance of Par- 
 liament and the government of the land ; he saw in the king of 
 England, not his monarch, but the partizan of Ormond, and 
 therefore an enemy. This, and an ancient alliance, linked him to 
 the cause of the English outcast prince, who solicited his aid ; 
 he had replied favourably to his request ; but his interests and 
 the conquest of a kingdom must be delayed, while he subdued 
 the half-naked septs who insulted his power. 
 
 While thus busied, reflecting upon the events of the day, the 
 earl sat silent and thoughtful. Suddenly, at a turn in the road, 
 he called on his followers to stop ; his eye lii^hted up, — he saw 
 two horsemen swiftly approaching — Lord Barry was the fore- 
 most rider. Forgetting his lameness in his joy, the noble

 warrior almost threw himself from the litter, as he cried, " Jesu 
 speed you, my loving cousin ! spur on ! spur on ! remember 
 your badge, Boutez en avant ! JNo enemy ever turned his back 
 on your sword to avoid, so eagerly as my arms will open to 
 receive you ! "Were you bound for Mallow ?" 
 
 " jN^o, my noble coz," replied Lord Barry, " I am for Kilne- 
 mullagh ; an eaglet I have nursed has winged its way thither, 
 and I fear may suffer injury in my absence ; for he is young, 
 ai^ his pinions all untried." 
 
 "Leave him to his fate, my lord," said the earl; "if he be 
 a faithful bird he will find his way back to his fosterer ; mean- 
 while the king of eagles, thy cousin Desmond himself, has need 
 of thee." 
 
 " One word, dear Maurice, will explain the greater duty that 
 I owe my princely fowl. The White Hose of England, missing 
 him, loses all ; you, I, each, and every one of us, are his servants 
 and must become his soldiers." 
 
 " Cousin," replied Desmond, " one son of York made my 
 father, whose soul God assoilzie ! Lord Deputy ; another 
 chopped off his head — so much for the White liose ! Still 
 I allow this new Lancastrian king is a bitterer enemy : he is 
 a friend of the Butlers, whom the fiend confound. We will first 
 subdue the O'Carrolls, humble the Macarthys, take Coollong 
 from Clan Cartie E.eagh, and root out the Desies ; and then, 
 when we are kings of Munster, in good hour let us march with 
 your duke of York, and set our foot on the necks of the Butlers 
 in Dublin." 
 
 The earl spoke with rapidity and energy ; all Munster 
 spread before Lord Barry's mind — city, town, stronghold, held 
 by ancestral enemies ; and it was wonderful what a change was 
 wrought in his mind by his cousin's eloquence, and the names 
 of all these sons of Erin, with each of whom he had a mortal 
 quarrel. He agreed, therefore, to go with the earl to Mallow 
 that evening, postponing his visit to Buttevant till the following 
 day. 
 
 Such were the wise counsels that stayed the mighty power 
 Barry had promised York should rise at his name to vanquish 
 England. It was better thus ; so the royal boy thought himself, 
 w hen, welcomed by Desmond at Mallow, he looked round on 
 kern and gallowglass, hearing a language that was not English, 
 viewing their strange attire and savage countenances. " It is 
 not thus, my England, that I will seize on you. Your own 
 ]ioblos shall place the crown on my head ; your people wield 
 the sword that will injure only our common enemy. Shall I

 make a Granada of my native land, and slied Christian blood, 
 better spilt in the cause of God against infidel do^s ?" 
 
 When the earl of Desmond found that the prince, whom he 
 regretted to receive "with such cold hopes, was well content, 
 nothing doubting that the good-will of the English would prove 
 a better ally than the spears of the Irish, he conceived a sudden 
 affection for him. It was no wonder ; for the ingenuousness of 
 untarnished youth is ineffably winning ; and here it was added 
 to a quick wit, a grace and gallantry, that shone as a vision of 
 light in this wild region. 
 
 A few days brought still greater satisfaction to all parties. 
 An embassy had arrived in Cork from the king of France to the 
 duke of York to invite him to Paris. Desmond would not 
 relinquish his guest : he carried him to his noble seat at Ard- 
 fiunin ; and thither repaired in due time the messengers from 
 Charles the Eighth. 
 
 The chief of these was our old friend Frion, besides a French- 
 man called Lucas, and two Englishmen, Stephen Poytron and 
 John Tiler. The duke was not well pleased with the selection of 
 Frion ; but, while this man by his singular arts of insinuation 
 made good his cause, Barry showed how in two points his cause 
 was benefitted by him. First, that having been secretary to 
 Henry, he knew many secrets, and was acquainted with many 
 circumstances that might be turned to use ; and, secondly, that 
 his very attempt to entrap the prince was a proof that he was 
 fully aware of who he was ; that he would prove a useful link 
 between Perkin Warbeck,Ilichard Fitzroy,and the duke of York; 
 that he need be no more trusted than was deemed expedient ; 
 but that meanwhile it were good to entertain him with fair 
 words. Hichard yielded ; and Frion made good use of this 
 standing-room by which he meant to move the world. Master 
 of the arts of flattery, cunning and wise, he so ingratiated him- 
 self with the duke, and afterwards with his other friends, that 
 by degrees he was admitted to their confidence ; and at last 
 succeeded in his chief wish, of becoming follower, secretary, 
 counsellor, he called himself friend, of the English prince. 
 
 Urged by the earl of Desmond and Lord Barry, and suf- 
 ficiently inclined in his own mind, the duke accepted the French 
 king's invitation, and prepared to cross to France. On the very 
 eve of his departure, he was surprised by a visit from John 
 O'Water, of Cork. This warm-hearted old man had conceived 
 a paternal love for the royal youth. He came to recommend 
 his return to Cork — his taking up a kind of regal residence 
 there — the not deserting a nook of his kingdom which acknow-

 ledged him. He came too late : — already the prince was on 
 board the vessel in You^hall Harbour which was to convey him 
 away. " One day you will return to us, my lord," said O'Water ; 
 " a future day will afford us opportunity to prove our zeal. I 
 am old ; I had ^iven up public life : but I will take to the oar 
 again. John O'Water will once more be mayor of Cork, and 
 his right beloved Sovereign shall command him in his service." 
 The good man departed ; with blessings, thanks, and glad 
 prognostics, Desmond and Barry also took leave of him. The 
 wind was fair, the sea smooth : before morning they lost sight 
 of the hospitable shores of Ireland, and turned their thoughts 
 from its quarrels, its chieftains, its warm hearts, and kind 
 reception, to the civilized land of France, and the more in- 
 fluential protection promised by its king to the royal adventurer.

 The voyage of the duke of York was easy and auspicious. He 
 repaired to Paris ; and all the exiled Yorkists, to the number of 
 one hundred gentlemen, instantly gathered round him, offering 
 him their services, and forming his court, Chatles assigned him 
 magnificent apartments in the Tuileries, and appointed a guard 
 of honour, under the command of the lord of Concressault, 
 who, as was the case with every one who approached him, soon 
 became warmly attached to the princely youth. Having just 
 concluded a peace with Britanny by marrying its young duchess, 
 the king of France found himself in so prosperous a state at 
 home, that he began to look abroad for wars, and resolved to 
 invade Naples, to whose crown he had a claim. Meanwhile, the 
 utmost splendour and gaiety reigned in Paris : — balls, tourna- 
 ments, and hunting-parties, succeeded one to the other j now to

 celebrate a marriage — now to grace the entrance of some noble 
 gentleman into the order of knighthood. Charles was an amiable 
 prince — his queen a beautiful and spirited lady — the duke of 
 Orleans an accomplished and adventurous cavalier. They all 
 vied in acts of courtesy and kindness towards their royal visitor. 
 There was an innocence in Kichard's vivacity, an ingenuousness 
 in his reliance on their protection, that particularly captivated the 
 chivalrous Orleans and the fair Queen Anne. How changed 
 the scene from the wilds of Ireland and the semi-barbarous halls 
 of the Desmond ! The courtly and soft grace of the French, 
 different from the dignity of the Spaniard, was irresistible to the 
 inexperienced youth. It seemed to him that his standard was 
 set up here for ever. No change could sully the fair favour of 
 these illustrious friends. All young as he vvas, to be treated as 
 rightful king of England by this potent government satisfied for 
 the moment his ambition. He and his English friends welcome 
 everywhere, all honoured — himself beloved — were the ascendant 
 star in Paris. O'Maurice of Desmond ! O'Barry, and good, 
 honest-hearted O'Water ! — though still he acknowledged your 
 kindness, how did your uncivilized hospitalities fade before the 
 golden splendour of King Charles's court ! 
 
 York might by the sober be blamed for yielding to the current, 
 for setting his swelling canvas with the favouring wind — exulting. 
 It was a boy's blindness ; the unsuspiciousness of inexperience ; 
 the fault lay in the falsehood ; and that was not his. 
 
 On the sixth of October Henry the Seventh landed at Calais ; 
 on the nineteenth he sat down before Boulogne, with sixteen 
 hundred men-at-arms, and twenty-five thousand infantry. Charles 
 could not much fear the tardy operations of his foe ; but the 
 name of an English invasion, so associated with defeat and 
 disaster, was portentous to the French : besides, Charles was 
 eager to prepare for his Italian wars. Thus disposed, peace was 
 easily brought about. One only obstable presented itself. 
 Henry insisted that the newly-arrived duke of York should be 
 delivered up to him ; Charles rejected the proposition with dis- 
 dain : the negotiations were suspended, and the French king 
 grew uneasy : it was no pleasant thing to have thirty or forty 
 thousand of those English in the kingdom, who had disputed it 
 inch by inch, at the expense of so much misery and slaughter, 
 with his grandfather. Their king was averse to war; but the 
 body of the army, the nobles, and leaders, ardently desired it : 
 some intrigue, some accident, might light up a train to be 
 quenched only by seas of blood ; and all this for a prince, in 
 whom, except that he was gallant and unfortunate, Charles took 
 no concern.

126 THE FRENCH COtTET. 
 
 Richard, basking in the noon-day of regal favour, of a sudden 
 felt a cloud spread athwart his sunshine, and a chill take place 
 of the glowing warmth. The comphiints of his followers, prin- 
 cipally of Lady Brampton, opened his eyes ; for the king and 
 princes, on the eve of betraying him, were in manner kinder than 
 ever. First, Queen Anne asked this lady, if it were not the 
 duke's intention to repair to Flanders, to claim the support of the 
 Lady Margaret. It seemed as if nothing was to be spoken of but 
 Brussels, the Low Countries, Maximilian of xiustria, and, above 
 all, the virtues and sagacity of the illustrious widow of Charles 
 the Hash. In youth we are slow to understand the covert 
 lang^uage of duplicity. Frion was next put in requisition ; he 
 arrived in Paris after ten days' absence, with an invitation to her 
 so-named nephew from the duchess of Burgundy ; and when, 
 from the disinclination of the French to an act of glaring inhos- 
 pitality, and of the English so to pain the confiding spirit of their 
 prince, he was still kept darkling, suddenly one night his friend, 
 the sire de Concressault, visited him. He brought many sugared 
 words from his sovereigns ; but the end was, that their ever dear 
 friend, and most honoured guest, the duke of York, would render 
 them special pleasure, if, for some short time, he would visit 
 Brussels. The fiery spirit of youth blazed forth at a dismission, 
 still more when Concressault added, that horses were already 
 prepared, and everything arranged for his immediate departure. 
 To qualify this insult, Concressault could best bring his own 
 warm, afi'ectionate feelings. He loved the English prince, and 
 by the frankness of his explanations, soothed him, while he made 
 the wound deeper, by showing whence it was directed, and that 
 Henry Tudor's was the the master-hand. 
 
 This name calmed York by elevating his thoughts above the 
 actual evil. " It is well, my lord : I shall obey," he said ; " I 
 had forgotten myself; and your monarch's kindness was an 
 opiate to m}' unripened purpose. I might have lived his happy 
 truest ; reigning over the English hearts around me, forgetful, 
 like Dan "Ulysse of old in the Lotus land, of my native isle, and 
 rightful kingdom, I thank my enemy he has not permitted this: 
 his insults rouse me ; his injuries place the sword in my hand ; 
 on him fall the harm." 
 
 The French sovereigns did all they could to salve this ill- 
 favoured wound. The duke of Orleans visited York at the 
 moment of his departure ; his English partizans were loaded 
 with presents ; he quitted France ; and, on the day following, 
 the treaty of peace with England was signed. 
 
 Pride, indignation, and heroic resolve sustained the duke under 
 this insult; but violent, angry emotion was foreign to his dispo-

 sition, and only kept alive in his bosom at tlie expense of much 
 suffering, Ho^ gladly he took refuge from these painful sensa- 
 tions in the gratitude and affection inspired by his noble a::nt. 
 Margaret had never seen him ; the earl of Lincoln, Lady 
 Brampton, Lovel, Plantagenet, and others were vouchers for his 
 truth ; still his first unsupported appearance in L'eland, and his 
 long absence in Spain, engendered doubts, not in her mind, but 
 in Maximilian and other nobles and counsellors around her. 
 She replied to their arguments, but they remained unconvinced ; 
 at once, therefore, to justify her acknowledgment of him in their 
 eyes, and to force them to the same credence as herself, she 
 caused his first audience to be a solemn one, nor gave him a 
 kinswoman's reception until he had proved his right to it. 
 
 He, who has heard some one falsely traduced and vilely calum- 
 niated, and, if not quite believing the detraction, yet impelled by 
 it to some distaste of its object, and when that object appeared, 
 radiant in innocence, attended by the dignity of truth and con- 
 scious worth, at once has yielded to the evidence of sense, will 
 have some understanding of what passed in the mind of jMarga- 
 ret of Burgundy. None could resist the frank, blue, unclouded 
 eye of the prince ; that voice and manner, replete with simplicity 
 and native honour. He replied to the duchess's questions briefly 
 or otherwise, as appeared most pertinent, but in a way that van- 
 quished the most sceptical person present. The warm-hearted 
 duchess had hardly contained herself from the moment she 
 beheld this youthful image of her dead brother. As the tones 
 of a remembered melody awaken from sweet and bitter associa- 
 tion unbidden tears, so did his voice, his gestures, the very 
 waving of his glossy curls, strike the mute chords of many a for- 
 gotten memory. As soon as she saw belief and satisfaction in 
 the countenances of those around her, she no longer restrained 
 herself; with tears she embraced him ; with a broken voice she 
 presented her nephew to all around. IMow to heap favours on 
 him was her dear delight : she loved not the name of the duke 
 of York, because, his pretensions admitted, he was something 
 more ; but he objected firmly to the empty title of king, and 
 reiterated his determination to assume that only at Westminster. 
 So she invented other names ; the prince of England, and the 
 "White Rose of England, were those he went by; she appointed 
 him a guard of thirty halberdiers in addition to that formed by 
 his English followers. Nor did she rest here ; it was her ardent 
 wisii to place Lim on the throne of his father. The glad welcome 
 she gave to the Yorkists, as, from far exile in distant lands, or 
 obscure hiding in England, they repaired to her nephew's court, 
 her discourse of succour, armies, plots quickly raised a spirit

 that spread to the near island; and the rumour of this new 
 White Rose became a watch-word of hope for York, of fear for 
 Lancaster. 
 
 The riches and magnificence of the now extinguished house of 
 Burgundy, almost equalled that of Paris ; their cavaliers were as 
 noble and as gallant ; their tournaments and feasts as gay and 
 pompous. The prince felt his situation much changed for the 
 better. His aunt's warm affection was more worth than Charles's 
 politic and courteous protection. There he was an honoured 
 visitor, here one of the family — his interests apparently bound up 
 with theirs. His long-tried friends exulted in his position ; 
 Piantagenet and Lady Brampton congratulated each other. The 
 English exiles, Sir George Neville and Sir John Taylor, the one 
 proud and discontented, the other extravagant and poor, blessed 
 the day which gave them dignity and station, as chief attendants 
 and counsellors of the noble York. One friend he missed : his 
 childhood's companion, his gentle nurse, his beloved Monina. 
 
 She had accompanied Lady Brampton to Paris, when intelli- 
 gence came of Trangmar's treachery, of the falsehood of his pre- 
 tensions ; and, at the same time, letters were covertly conveyed 
 to Lady Brampton from the dowager queen, in which mention 
 was made of this man as a trustworthy agent : the Yorkists 
 desired much to fathom this mystery, and to have some explicit 
 elucidation from the imprisoned Elizabeth. As they canvassed 
 the various modes by which this might be accomplished — the 
 disguises that might be assumed — Monina preferred an earnest 
 prayer, that she might be permitted to undertake the task ; a 
 thousand circumstances rendered this desirable — she would be 
 entirely unsuspected, and she was fully acquainted with the cir- 
 cumstances of the case. Three days before Eichard landed in 
 France from Ireland, Monina crossed to England — she assumed 
 a pilgrim's garb, and without danger or much difficulty, arrived 
 at London from the seacoast. 
 
 The sudden apparition of Eichard, first in Ireland, and after- 
 wards in Paris, was a stunning blow to Henry. No Trangmar 
 arrived to explain the riddle ; and, in spite of his caution and his 
 cruelty, he had beenunable to avert the event he dreaded — nothing 
 could he do now better than to scoff* at his rival, and to oppose 
 his statements with counter declarations ; spreading around his 
 spies to stop at its very outset any symptom of rebellion in 
 England. He caused stricter watch than ever to be set on the 
 unfortunate Elizabeth Woodville, who had been for six years the 
 melancholy inmate of her convent prison. All necessity of caution 
 there was soon to be at an end ; her health had long declined — • 
 latterly she had wasted to a mere shadow, so that the continuance

 of life in her attenuated frame appeared a miracle : a feeling 
 of suffocation prevented her from lying down ; she sat propped 
 by pillows : her fleshless hands incapable of any office, her 
 cheeks fallen in; her eyes alone — last retreat of the spirit of life 
 —gleamed brightly amid the human ruin. So long had she been 
 thus, that her death, apparently so near, was hardly feared by 
 those around. Henry almost considered her danger as a new 
 artifice, and absolutely refused her last request, to be permitted 
 to see her daughter and grand -children once again. Her last 
 hour approached ; and none were near save the nuns of the 
 convent, who almost revered her as a saint. 
 
 There arrived at the monastery a pilgrim, with relics collected 
 in Araby and Spain. She was admitted into the parlour ; and 
 one simple sister asked for some wonder-working relic that 
 might give health to the dying. The pilgrim heard of Eliza- 
 beth's hopeless state : she begged to be admitted to her presence, 
 that she might try the virtues of a precious balsam given her by 
 the monks of Alcala-la-Heal in Spain. Elizabeth was informed 
 of her request : when last she had heard of her son, he was at 
 Alcala — all the strength that had prolonged her life now roused 
 itself; with earnestness she desired that the Spanish maiden 
 might be admitted to her presence. It was Henry's express 
 Qomm.and that none should see her ; but she was dying ; his 
 power, so soon to be at end, might well slacken in its rigour at 
 the very verge of its annihilation. 
 
 The pilgrim knelt beside the queen's couch — the nuns, 
 commanded to retreat, observed a miracle — the dying appeared 
 again to live ; the grim spectre, who had planted his banner in 
 the chamber, retreated for a moment, as Elizabeth listened to 
 Monina's whispered words, " Oh, for one hour more," she cried, 
 " I have so much to say. He comes then, my son comes ! Oh, 
 rouse England with the tale — Sir AVilliam Stanle}'', you must 
 visit him — bid him not draw his sword against my Edward's 
 son. Say to the dean of St, Paul's — I feel famt," she continued, 
 " my voice fails me — I must leave all unsaid, save this — His 
 sister must not doubt his truth ; Henry must not shed the blood 
 of his wife's brother." 
 
 " Madam," said Monina, " let me bear some token to my lady 
 the queen." 
 
 " A token — no words can these weak fingers trace. Yet stay ; 
 in the missal there is a prayer which each day I addressed to 
 heaven to preserve my sou. Bear the missal to my Elizabeth, bid 
 her listen to you, and believe." 
 
 With trembling hands the young girl took the small, but 
 splendid volume. The queen then dismissed her with a faintly

 Bpoken blessint^ and a prayer. Before nifrlit all was over — the 
 cause of her son moved her no more — her sorrowing heart 
 reposed from every strife — she died. The vase replete with so 
 much anguish was broken — the "silver cord," that bound 
 together a whole life of pain, loosened. Her existence had been 
 woe ; her death was the dearest blessing she could receive from 
 heaven.

 Coleridge. 
 
 While in attendance on the king at his palace of Shene, the 
 the lord chamberlain, Sir William Stanley, was informed that a 
 young and foreign lady requested an audience with him. Monina 
 was ushered in — her extraordinary beauty — her large soft eyes 
 — the fascinating sweetness of her manner, at once charmed the 
 worthy gentleman. She spoke in good but accentuated English, 
 and informed Sir William that she came from the death-bed of 
 the queen of En^jland. 
 
 •' 1 know," said Stanley, "that her grace has long been ill, 
 but " 
 
 " God take her to his mercy," interrupted Monina, " she died 
 last night." 
 
 " Is his majesty informed of this event?" Sir William asked. 
 
 " It is not yet noon," replied the maiden ; " by that hour the 
 messengers from the convent will arrive. I have reasons for 
 greater speed. I bear the royal lady's last words to her 
 daughter, the queen Elizabeth ; you, my lord, will favour me 
 by procuring an immediate interview with her majesty." 
 
 Stanley knew the aversion the king had to any private inter- 
 course between Elizabeth and her mother. He informed his 
 visitor that she must first obtain the king's permission for this 
 audience, which he did not believe would be granted ; but 
 Monina, without hesitation, declared that she would apply for 
 it to the king, and requested the chamberlain to introduce her.

 Stanley, ^ood-natured but timid, hesitated — she would not be 
 denied — at last he hit upon an expedient. Henry had ^one out 
 hawkinf]^ in the park : if she would place herself at the gate on 
 his return, she might prefer her prayer — he would be near to 
 insure her being heard. 
 
 ISToontide was approached. The sport was over, and the royal 
 party on their return. Henry rode foremost with Morton, 
 while his retinue followed at a slower pace, conversing gaily 
 about the birds ; now and then hazarding a remark on the war, 
 so oft delayed, at last declared. They were interrupted by the 
 arrival of Sir William Stanley, who communicated to the king 
 the tidings of the dowager queen's death. Six long years had 
 passed since the battle of Stoke, and the commencement of 
 Elizabeth Woodville's imprisonment. She was forgotten at 
 court. Many there had never seen her ; few remembered her 
 as the reigning queen of England. Her history was almost 
 like a romance of the olden time ; yet, forgotten during life, her 
 death clouded the hilarity of those who heard it. Among those 
 most affected by these tiaings, as was natural, was her son, the 
 marquess of Dorset ; he hastily rode up to receive from 
 Stanley's own lips confirmation of the news. Feeling that of late 
 he had almost forgotten and wholly neglected his mother, a 
 sudden visitation of remorse was blended with the grief that 
 choked his voice, and blinded his eyes with tears. Henry, who 
 was attached to him, viewed with pity the bitter regret of his 
 g&j, unheeding kinsman, and bade him, ere ruder tongues 
 proclaimed it, bear the melancholy tidings to his royal sister. 
 Dorset, gladly escaping from the throng, rode swiftly forward. 
 Meanwhile the order of the ride was disturbed. The nobles 
 conversed earnestly together. After a few questions, Henry 
 remained lost in thought : eager perhaps to know whether her 
 secret had died with her ; and viewing in her demise one master 
 testimony the less in favour of his young competitor. Stanley 
 awaited with some inquietude for the moment when they should 
 encounter Monina. They passed the park gate. She was not 
 there. Henry pursued his way, and entered the palace. Still 
 she did not appear. 
 
 Lord Dorset had ridden on with the speed of a man who seeks 
 to escape from himself. Death has more power in its mere 
 sound, than the enchanting touch of a wizard's rod. She was 
 dead — how awful was that word ! — the unfailing friend, his 
 mother ! All his remissiiess towards her took a monstrous 
 form : he felt that if he had wearied Henry with prayers, he 
 might have extorted some mitigation of her suffering ; and it 
 would have consoled her in her solitude, to have received the

 balmy medicine of filial tenderness, wliich he had neglected to 
 pay. At that moment he would have given his marquisate to 
 a beggar, to have purchased the memory of one action done to 
 soothe her woful end. The pomp of a funeral — masses for her 
 soul — tliese were small compensations, which her arch enemy, 
 even Henry himself, could, and probably would concede. The 
 voice of affection — the duteous affection of a child — he only 
 could have afforded ; and he had withheld it. 
 
 Monina stood at the park gate, attended by her Spanish 
 domestic, whose singular costume alone must attract regard. 
 "What do you here, maiden?" cried Dorset; " the king and 
 his court will speedily pass this way : this is no fitting place 
 for you." 
 
 " I am here," she replied, " to see and speak to your king. I 
 come to prefer a request in the name of one whom God take to 
 his place ; she can disturb him no more." 
 
 " You are from Bermondsey — from " The words choked 
 
 Dorset. Monina continued : — " I come from the death-bed of 
 the Lady Elizabeth of England." 
 
 " What demand would you make on his majesty ? " said the 
 marquess ; do you seek a guerdon for your pains ? Speak, then, 
 to me — I am her son." 
 
 He was about to draw forth his purse ; but her look, which 
 grew animated, prevented him, as she said, "I come on a holy 
 errand. The dying lady commanded me to convey her last 
 words to her royal daughter. I seek permission from your king 
 to fulfil her wish." 
 
 Dorset was thoughtless and eager. He saw no objection that 
 Henry could have that his sister should have the last message 
 from her now dead parent; so without hesitation he told the 
 maiden that by Henry's permission he was now about to com- 
 municate the sad intelligence to the queen, and that she might 
 accompany him. 
 
 It is thus by small invisible threads that Fate weaves the 
 intricate web of our lives. All hung by the slenderest tissue : 
 had Monina seen Henry, most , assuredly he would have pre- 
 vented the interview she sought, and have used his utmost craft 
 to discover whether the fatal secret made a part of the queen's 
 message. Now his sagacity, his caution, his severity were of no 
 avail. Monina stood in the presence of his wife. 
 
 Six years had considerably altered Elizabeth ; habitual fear 
 had engendered a moral timidity, which was not natural to her, 
 for she was the daughter of a proud race : her sweetness, her 
 affectionate disposition still remained ; but her soul was sad, 
 and she looked pale and inanimate. The news of her mother's

 clcatli moved her to tears. One expression of bitter ret^ret 
 burst from her lips ; it was mingled with blame of her consort ; 
 and she checked herself, while she wept still more abundantly. 
 Dorset felt 'uneasy at the sight of female tears ; he longed to 
 escape. Monina's request for a private interview came to 
 liberate him ; he presented her to his sister, and hurried away. 
 
 Elizabeth eagerly asked many questions concerning her 
 mother's dying moments. The Spanish maiden, wondering at 
 her own success, fearful of interruption, presented the missal, 
 and then hastened to declare the motive for which it was sent. 
 She opened the jewelled clasps, and showed the queen the prayer 
 written in her mother's hand on a blank leaf of the brilliantly- 
 illuminated pages. Hapidly the enthusiastic girl detailed the 
 escape, the exile of the duke of York, while Elizabeth, not 
 daring to believe her own senses, astounded, terrified, looked 
 with largo open eyes on the animated eountenanc'e of her lovely 
 visitant. Before Monina paused, or gave time for an answer, 
 they were interrupted by the entrance of Sir William Stanley. 
 He started when he saw Monina, nor did the confused look of 
 his queen, as she hastily closed the fatal volume, tend to re -assure 
 him. He came to announce a visit from Henry to Elizabeth. 
 Frightened at what he saw, he hardly permitted a slight inter- 
 change of greeting, but hurried Monina away, through a door 
 hid by the tapestry, down a narrow staircase into a garden, 
 and then by a small gate that opened on a court. In this 
 court was placed the entrance to the apartments of the pages 
 and esquires of the king. Stanley unlocked the gate cautiously, 
 hesitating before he permitted his fair companion to pass on, in 
 the fear that some mischievous boy or prying servitor might be 
 there to wonder at and question wherefore he led the maiden 
 from the queen's garden through a door, sacred, and never opened, 
 into the resort of wild and dissolute youth. As he unclosed the 
 wipket, at its very entrance, standing so that in spite of every 
 caution a full view of Monina was at once afforded, stood a 
 young man, whose countenance bespoke him to be ever on the 
 alert for gamesome tricks or worse mischief. His first aspect 
 vras that of recklessness ; his second spoke of baser habits ; and 
 athwart both broke gleams now of better feelings, now of 
 desperate passion. He had heard the rusty bolts move, and 
 perceived the slow opening of the door. Knowing how sacred 
 was the respect enforced towards this ingress to the queen's 
 retirement, he stood close to discover and shame any intruder. 
 ** In good season, my Lord Chamberlain ! " he at first exclaimed, 
 vexed to find no cause for taunt, till perceiving his fair com- 
 panion, the expression of his countenance changed to ii'ony, as

 he cried, " AVliither so fast and fearfully, my good lord ? Does 
 her grace deal in contraband ; and art thou the huckster? " 
 
 " As ill luck will have it, wild Eobiu CHfford ! " cried Stanley, 
 angrily, 
 
 *' Nay, we are brothers in wildness now, fair sir," retorted the 
 other ; '" and I claim my part here." 
 
 Clifford approached Monina ; but Stanley interposed. "Waste 
 your ribaldry on me, good knight, but spare this child. Let us 
 pass in all speed, I pray you." 
 
 Monina drew back ; but CHfford still followed. " Child ! In 
 good hour she is young ; and but that burning suns have made 
 her cheek tawny, I might call her fair. She is well worth your 
 pains, and I praise them. Sweet mistress, I am beholden to my 
 Lord Chamberlain for making us friends." 
 
 He was running on thus ; but Monina, collecting her spirits, 
 raised her large eyes on him. His name had caught her ear ; she 
 remembered partly having seen him on the night of their flight 
 from Tournay ; and frequent mention had subsequently been 
 made of him by the cousms. She began—" Sir Kobert Clifford, 
 I know you will not harm me." 
 
 *' Thanks for that knowledge, pretty one," cried the youth ; 
 " old grey-beards only, with frozen hearts (pardon me, Sir 
 "William !), could injure thee ; thou art sure of good from tall 
 fellows (though in troth tall I am not) like me." 
 
 Sir William writhed with impatience ; again and again he 
 would have interrupted the intruder. Monina replied : — " We 
 have met before — when you served him I now serve. I speak in 
 his name : for the sake of Peekin Warbeck, detain me no 
 longer. Noble sir, I attend you. Sir Clifford yields respect to 
 the words I have spoken." 
 
 *' They are strange indeed, maiden," he replied, ** and I must 
 hear more of this. We have met before, I now believe ; and 
 we must meet again. Meanwhile, I will keep off birdcatchers 
 till you and his reverence get clear of these limed twigs. Ah ! 
 I see a gallant ; I will go draw William d'Aubigny aside while 
 you pass forth." 
 
 And now again Sir William proceeded on his expedition, and 
 conducted his gentle companion beyond the precincts of the 
 palace. As they parted one from the other, Monina, in a brief, 
 energetic manner, delivered the message of the departed queen 
 to the good chamberlain : he was more disconcerted than sur- 
 prised, and the reflection that Clifford was a party to the secret, 
 added to his consternation. He felt how far he was compro- 
 mised by the introduction of Monina to the young queen ; fear 
 for a while palsied his better feelings : he replied only by

 entreatinof her not to remain lono^er in London, but to embark in 
 all haste for France : he then quitted her, yet aj^ain came back 
 to ask where she sojourned in town, and turned away a second 
 time, as if to escape from his better self, and from the interest 
 he felt in King Edward's son, which impelled him to ask a 
 thousand questions. 
 
 He returned to the courtyard of the palace, and found Clif- 
 ford pacing its length in deep thought. Monina's words had 
 awakened a thousand ideas in his unquiet bosom. Since the 
 event to which she referred, when he delivered Eichard from 
 Prion's hands, he had run a headlong, ruinous course. No 
 character can be wholly evil ; and Clifford's was not destitute 
 of good, though overgrown and choked up by weedy vices, so 
 that his better nature too often served but as a spur and in- 
 centive to folly and crime. He was generous ; but that led to 
 rapacity ; since, unable to deny himself or others, if he de- 
 spoiled himself one day, on the next he engaged in the most 
 desperate enterprises to refill the void. He was bold — that made 
 him fearless in doing wrong ; and to drown the gentle spirit 
 of humanity, which, too often for his own peace, sprung up in 
 -his heart, he hardened himself in selfishness ; then, as his sen- 
 sitive, undisciplined nature received new impressions, he was 
 cowardly, cruel, and remorseless. He had never forgotten the 
 princely boy he had saved : he turned to that recollection as to 
 one of the few oases of virtue in the far extended desert of ill, 
 over which, in hours of satiety or despondency, his sickening 
 memory wandered. Indeed, he was yet too young to be decidedly 
 vicious : for at one-and-twenty a thousand mere human impulses, 
 imrepressed by worldly wisdom, occasion sallies of kindly sym- 
 pathy. The worst was, that Clifford was a ruined man : his 
 fortunes were nought, his reputation shaken on its base ; he 
 veiled, by an appearance of hilarity and recklessness, the real 
 despair that gnawed at his heart, when he considered all that 
 he might have been — the worse than nothing that he was. 
 Hitherto he had, to a great degree, blinded the world, and he 
 longed for some adventure, some commotion, either public or 
 private, that should refill his emptied money-bags, and paint 
 him fair in men's eye's : all these considerations mingled incon- 
 gruously to make him wish to know more of the outcast duke. 
 He awaited the return of Stanley — he learned the name of the 
 Spanish girl : as they spoke, both became aware that the other 
 possessed a secret each dreaded to avow. Clifford first dashed 
 through the flimsy barrier of useless discretion, and related his 
 adventure at Lisle ; meantime Sir William broke forth in 
 lamentation, that young Eichard should have been induced to

 quit the security of private life, to enter on an unequal and 
 bloody contest, which could only end in destruction to himself 
 and his partizans, while England would again be made the tomb 
 of the Irish (the landing of Eichard at Cork was all that was 
 then known), whom he might allure from their woods and bogs 
 to ravage the more gifted sister isle. A new light was let in 
 on Clifford at these words. "Was the game already playing — 
 the box shaken — the die about to fall ? This required his atten- 
 tion, and determined his half-formed purpose of visiting, that 
 same night, the daughter of de Paro.

 It had been Monina's design to return to the protection of 
 Lady Brampton, immediately on the fulfilment of her task in 
 England. The appearance of Clifford suggested other ideas. 
 It was the duty of every friend of York to declare his existence, 
 and claim the allegiance of his subjects. It might seem a hope- 
 less enterprise for her, a young foreign girl, to do this in the 
 heart of the usurper's power ; and yet she fancied that she might 
 attempt it with success. The most distant prospect of serving 
 her beloved friend was hailed by her with romantic ardour ; 
 ■while the knowledge possessed by Stanley and Clifford promised 
 to render her undertaking less nugatory in its effects. Her 
 purpose was quickly formed. She resolved to postpone her 
 departure, and to busy herself in replanting, in Tudor's own 
 city of London, the uprooted rose-bush, parent of the spotless 
 flower. None but a woman's fond enthusiastic heart can tell the

 glow of joy, tlie thrilling gladness, that diffused itself through her 
 frame, as this plain spread itself, clear as a map, beautiful as a 
 champagne country viewed from some overtopping mountain 
 peak, to her keen mind's eye. She rode to London occupied by 
 these thoughts, and on her arrival, announced to the merchant 
 friend, at whose house she resided, her intention of remaining in 
 England : the vessel that was on the morrow to have conveyed 
 her away would bear instead a letter to Lady Brampton, explana- 
 tory of her hopes and intentions : that very night, in the seclusion 
 of her chamber, she robbed some hours from sleep to write 
 it ; her enthusiasm animated her expressions ; her cheeks glowed 
 as she wrote, for she spoke of services she might render to him 
 who was the. idol of her thoughts; though with his idea she 
 consciously mingled no feeling save that of devoted friendship 
 and an intense desire to benefit. The weariness of spirit that 
 oppressed her in his absence, she did not attribute to him. 
 
 Thus intently occupied, she was unaware of a parley in the 
 room beneath growing into a loud contention, till steps upon 
 the stairs recalled her wandering thoughts ; she looked up from 
 her task ; but her gaze of inquiry was changed to an expression 
 of heartfelt pleasure, when Sir Bobert Clifford entered the 
 apartment. Here then her enterprise commenced. There was 
 something that did not quite please her in the manners of her 
 visitant, but this was secondary to the great good she might 
 achieve through him. Her eyes danced in their own joy, as 
 she cried, " Welcome, gallant gentleman ! you are here to my 
 wish : you come to learn how best you may prove your alle- 
 giance to your rightful sovereign, your zeal in his cause." 
 
 These words grated somewhat on the ear of a man who had 
 hitherto worn the Red Hose in his cap, and whose ancestors had 
 died for Lancaster. He did not, therefore, reply in the spirit 
 of her wish when he said, "We will not quarrel, pretty one, 
 about names ; sooth is it, that T came to learn tidings of my 
 princely gossip, and I am right glad that fortune makes thee 
 the tale-bearer. Prolong as thou wilt, I shall never cry hold 
 while my eyes serve to make true harmony to the sound of your 
 sweet voice." 
 
 Much more he said in the same strain of gallantry, as he 
 placed himself beside the maiden, with the air of one whose 
 soft speeches ever found ready hearing. Monina drew back, 
 replying, gently, " I am the partizan, the vowed conspirator 
 for a cause, whose adherents walk as over the thread-broad 
 ridge spanning an unfathomable gulph, which I have heard 
 spoken of by the Moors in my own G-ranada ; I beseech you, as 
 you are a gentleman, reserve your fair speeches for the fortu-

 nate ladies of your native land. I will be a beacon light to 
 guide you, a clue for your use through a maze, a landmark to 
 point your way ; meanwhile, forget me as I am ; let me be a 
 voice only." 
 
 " As soon forget sunshine or moonshine, or the chance of play 
 when the dice-box rattles," thought Clifford, as she clasped her 
 little fingers in the fervour of her wish, and raised on him her 
 soft, full eyes : but though he gazed with unrepressed admiration, 
 he said nothing as she told the story of Duke E-ichard's Spanish 
 adventures, and last of his attempt in Ireland and the embassy 
 sent to him by King Charles. How eloquently and well she told 
 his tale ! speaking of him with unfeigned admiration, nothing 
 disguising her zealous devotion. " Sir Clifford," she continued, 
 '•' you are his friend. His cause will sanctify your sword ; it will 
 call you from the paltry arts of peace to the nobler deeds of 
 chivalry ; it will give you grace in the eyes of her you love, 
 defending and asserting your king." 
 
 She paused, breathless from her own agitation ; she looked up 
 into his thoughtful face and placed her hands on his ; the soft 
 touch awoke him from a reverie in which he had lost himself. 
 
 " Maiden," he replied, " you plead your cause even too well ; 
 you have cast a spell upon me ; so that at this moment I would 
 readily swear to perform your bidding, but that, when I do not 
 see your witch's eyes, nor hear your matzic voice, another wind 
 may blow me right to the other side. Do not call this courtly 
 gallantry, would by Saint Cupid that it were ! for I am not pleased 
 to behold my snge self fined down into a woman's tool : nor is it 
 love ; — Thor's hammer could not knock a spHnter from my hard 
 heart, nor the Spanish sun thaw its seven-fold coat of ice. I 
 never have loved ; I never shall : but there is some strange 
 sorcery about you. When I next see you, I will draw a circle 
 round, knock my head tliree times on the eastern floor, and call 
 out 'aroint!' This twinkling light too, and darkling hour — I 
 must away : — sunshine shall, when next we meet, protect me 
 from your incantations. Will you trust yourself ? At to- 
 morrow's noon a servitor of mine shall await you at the gate of 
 St. Paul's: dare you commit yourself to one in the devil's pay?" 
 
 All this incoherent talk was spoken at intervals ; he rose, sat 
 down, stood over her as she patiently let him run his tether's 
 length : his last words were said in an insinuating, and, as well 
 as he could command, a soft voice, as he pressed her hand in his. 
 She crossed herself, as she replied, " Our Lady and my cause 
 shall protect me, while I adventure life fearlessly for its sake ! 
 Adieu till then, sir knight : the saints guard you, and give you 
 better thoughts."

 The cavalier proceeded homewards, considering deeply the 
 part he was to act. He thought of what he might gain or lose 
 by siding with the duke ; and he was angry to find that the 
 image of Monina presented itself even more vividly, than his 
 ambitious dreams. "God assoil me," thought he. "I will 
 repeat a paternoster backwards, and so unsay her sorceries. She 
 has persuaded me, even as my own soul did before, that the best 
 mode to mend my broken fortunes, and better still to regild my 
 faded escutcheon, is to join Duke Eichard. Yet, after all, this 
 may be mere magic ; for once I will act a wise man's part, and 
 seek old gray-beard, my Lord Fitzwater." 
 
 Lord Fitzwater endured impatiently the harsh countenance 
 Henry bore to him, ever since he had permitted his young rival 
 to escape. Some question of right and law, which implicated a 
 large portion of his possessions, had, as he believed, been unjustly 
 decided against him through the interposition of the king, who, 
 on every occasion, sought to mortify and injure the old man. 
 He lived as the disgraced and impoverished servants of a court 
 are wont to live, neglected and forgotten. He had no family. 
 He loved Robert Clifford better than any other in the world ; 
 and he, when suffering from disappointment or loss, when his 
 own pain reminded him of that of others, sought his ancient 
 friend — too seldom to please him with a show of reverence, often 
 enough to keep alive his affection. 
 
 If it were good for him to aid in the replanting of the White 
 Eose, so also were it well that Lord Fitzwater joined the same 
 party. He talked even to himself of asking his experienced 
 friend's advice ; he really meant to endeavour to seduce him into 
 a companionship in the projected rebellion against Henry Tudor. 
 In this spirit he paid his visit ; nearly three months had elapsed 
 since his preceding one. The noble received him coldly; so ab 
 once to break through the ceremony that fettered their discourse, 
 he cried, " I hear from soft Sir William Stanley, that his majesty 
 has again said that he will find a way to thank you for a service 
 you rendered him some six years ago." 
 
 " I have long had knowledge of his grace's good memory on 
 that point," answered his lordship, angrily ; " and yours, 
 methinks, might remind you of the part you played. By St. 
 Thomas, Eobin, I believe you saw further in the game than I. 
 But what makes the king harp on this out-worn tale ?" _ 
 
 " Few know — we may guess. Have you not heard him tell of 
 a new king of kerns and gallow-glasses ? a phantom duke, whose 
 duchy lies without the English pale in Ireland ? a ghost whose 
 very name makes the king's knees knock together as he sits on 
 the throne ? This ruffler, who calls himself son of Edward the

 Fourth, the Pi-ince Eicliard of York, escaped from the Tower, 
 bears a strange resemblance to the hero of Lisle. Perkia 
 Warbeck." 
 
 "Would, by St. George, lie were the same!" exclaimed the 
 noble ; " my dagger should sever the entwined roses, our armed 
 liecls tread to dust the cankered red blossom." 
 
 " You speak treason, my lord," said Clifford ; " but you speak 
 to a friend. Let us talk more calmly. I, the playmate of the 
 imprisoned prince, knovrthat he, Perkin Warbeck, and the Irish 
 hero are the same — this I can prove : so much for the justice of 
 our cause ; as to the expediency, — we, my good lord, are styled 
 Lancastrians, but our meed therefore is small. Tudor is a nigujard 
 king ; Plantageuet, a young and generous adventurer. What 
 shall vre say? Shall Fitzwater and Clifford place the sacred 
 diadem on this boy's head, and become chiefs in the land -where 
 they now pine obscurely ? " 
 
 Lord Fitzwater fastened his keen eyes on his companion, while 
 his hand involuntary grasped his dagger's hilt. " I am not an 
 old man," he cried j "fifty-seven winters have shed no snows 
 upon my head. I remember when, at Tewkesbury, I smote an 
 iron-capped yeoman who raised his battle-axe against our young 
 Edward, and clove the villain to the throat. I can wield the 
 same weapon — do the same deed now ; and I am thrown like a 
 rusty sword among old armour — refused permission to lead my 
 followers to Calais. War in France ! — it will never be : the word 
 is grown obsolete in England. Ambassadors thrive instead of 
 valiant captains ; crafty penmanship in lieu of straightforward 
 blows. Art sure, Robin, that this youth is King Edward's 
 son?". 
 
 This was the first step Clifford took ; and the eagerness of 
 Fitzwater quickly impelled him to spread wider the narrow circle 
 of conspirators. The intelligence, meanwhile, that the king 
 of France had received in Paris with meet honour a Yorkist 
 pretender to the crown burst at once over England, spreading 
 wonder and alarm. Some few despised the pretensions of the 
 youth ; the greater number gave to them full and zealous cre- 
 dence. Many, dreading Henry's sagacity and harshness, re- 
 coiled from every thought rebellious to him ; others hailed with 
 joy the appearance of a rival who would shake his throne, and 
 hold forth hope of disturbance and change. As yet this was talk 
 merely ; nay, there was more thought, than spoken. Men ex- 
 pected that some other would make the first move, which would 
 put in play the menacing forces mustered on either eide. Mo- 
 nima saw with joy the work well begun. She remembered the 
 queen's injunction to seek the Dean of St. Paul's : in acquiring

 him, many reverent and powerful partizans were secured. Her 
 presence added to the mterest which the mere name of Eichard 
 of York excited. Many who disbelieved his tale were eager to 
 behold his lovely advocate : they listened to her syren eloquence, 
 and ranged themselves on her side. Clifford watched jealously 
 the influence she acquired. When he first saw her, she had 
 been an untaught girl in comparison with the graceful, self-pos- 
 sessed being who now moved among them. One feeling in 
 her heart separated her indeed from the crowd — but this was 
 veiled, even to herself; and she appeared courteous, benign to 
 all. Clifford often flattered himself that when she spoke to him 
 her expressions were more significant, her voice sweeter. He 
 did not love — no, no — his heart could not entertain the effeminate 
 devotion ; but if she loved him, could saints in heaven reap 
 higher glory ? Prompted by vanity, and by an unavowed im- 
 pulse, he watched, hung over her, fed upon her words, and felt 
 that in pleasing her he was for the present repaid for the zeal he 
 manifested for the duke her friend. Strange he never suspected 
 that she was animated towards the prince by a deeper feeling. 
 They had lived like near relations from their childhood ; that 
 were sufficient to raise the flame that shed so bright a light over 
 her soul : that he was a prince, and she the daughter of a Spanish 
 mariner, forbade their union; and he paid the just tribute to 
 innocent youth, in not judging of its upright purity by the dis- 
 torted reflection his depraved heart presented, whenever he 
 dared turn his eyes inward. 
 
 Foundation was thus laid in England for a momentous com- 
 bination. Intelligence from the continent was gathered with 
 keen interest. Early in December the army of Henry recrossed 
 the Channel : they brought word of the favour and esteem 
 Eichard enjoyed at the French court, of the zeal of the exiled 
 Yorkists, of their satisfied assurance of his truth. Next was 
 spread abroad the news of his reception by the dowager duchess 
 of Burgundy, and the brilliant figure he made at Brussels. 
 What step would be taken next to advance his cause? 
 
 This was a fearful question for the actual king of England. 
 He redoubled his artful policy, while he wore a mask of mere 
 indifference. The Yorkists, not yet considerable enough to act 
 openly, or even covertly to combine for any great attempt, felt 
 fresh bonds thrown over, new and vexatious tyrannies in exercise 
 against them. This served to unite and animate their chiefs ; 
 they each and all resolved that, when fit opportunity armed their 
 prince, their swords should at the same moment leap from the 
 scabbards, darkly to be dyed ere resheathed, or struck useless 
 from their lifeless hands. The days of St. Alban's and Tewkes-

 bury passed in all tlieir grim conclusions before tlieir eyes, but 
 the event was worth the risk : defeated, they lost nothing ; vic- 
 torious, they exchanged a narrow-hearted, suspicious, exacting 
 tyrant for a chivalrous and munificent sovereign ; Henry Tudor, 
 the abhorred Lancastrian, for the grandson of York, the lineal 
 heir of Edward the Third — the true representative of the kings 
 of the glorious and long line of the Plantaganets.

 Shakespeare. 
 
 In the days of our earlier history, our commerce led us to have 
 more intercourse with Flanders than with France. That which 
 journeyed slowly and doubtfully from Paris came in all the heat 
 of a first impression from the Low Countries. A train had been 
 laid before, which now took light and blazed through the king- 
 dom. The duchess of Burgundy's reception of the duke of York, 
 the honours rendered him at her court, the glad gathering together 
 of the fugitive English, gave pledge of his truth, and promise 
 of glorious results. Sedition began to spring up in England on 
 every side ; even as, after a mild rain in the birth of the year, a 
 black, ploughed field is suddenly verdant with the young blades 
 of wheat. All who had, since the battles of Bosworth and of 
 Stoke, lived in seclusion or fear ; all who from whatever reason 
 had taken sanctuary ; men of ruined fortunes, who desired to 
 escape bondage ; came singly or in small companies to the coast, 
 embarked for the continent, and hastened to the court of the 
 dowager of Burgundy. All discontented men, who felt them- 
 selves looked coldly on by Tudor, to whom they had yielded the 
 throne of their native land ; many, whom it grieved and vexed 
 to see the world stagnate in changeless peace, desirous of novelty 
 and glad of any pretence that called them into activity, dashed

 headlong into revolt; nor were there few, chiefly indeed amonoj 
 the nobility, who had lamented the fall of the House of York, 
 and hailed gladly this promise of its resuscitation. The common 
 adventurers and soldiers of fortune acted on their single separate 
 resolves ; the noble adherents of the White Eose drew together, 
 that there might be plan and strength in their schemes. They 
 were cautious, for their enemy was crafty and powerful j they 
 were resolute, for they hated him. 
 
 Out, far in the low flats bordering the river Lea, there stood, 
 in a marshy hollow, a straggling village, now effaced from the 
 landscape. At its extremity was a solid, but gloomy, square 
 brick house, surrounded by a moat, which the low watery soil 
 easily filled, even to overflow ; and the superfluity was received 
 in a deep stagnant pool at the back of the mansion. The damp 
 atmosphere had darkened the structure, and thrown a mantle of 
 green moss and speckled lichen over the bricks. Its fantastically 
 carved and heavy portal yawned like a black cavern's mouth, and 
 added to the singularly desolate appearance of the mansion. 
 The village was but half inhabited, and looked as struck by 
 poverty and discomfort. The house belonged to the Clifford 
 family. It had been built, it was said, in Henry the Fifth's 
 time, when Sir Eoger Clifford, a stern old man, following his 
 sovereign to the wars, shut up here his beautiful young wife, so 
 to insure her fidelity during his absence. Among her peers and 
 gentle companions, the Lady Clifford had doubtless been true to 
 the bond that linked her to her lord ; but, alone in this solitary 
 mansion, surrounded by ill-natured peasants, pining for her 
 father's pleasant halls, and her girHsh enjoyments, no wonder 
 that she found her state intolerable. Age and jealousy are ill 
 mates for youth and sprightliness, and suspicion easily begets 
 that which it abhors even to imagine. One who had loved her 
 in her virgin days introduced himself into her suite ; the brief 
 months of stolen happiness passed by, and the green stagnant 
 pool was, they said, the cold sepulchre of the betrayed lovers. 
 Since then, during the wars of York and Lancaster, this house 
 had been the resort of Clifford's followers : and, when the White 
 Eoseljecame supreme, that alone of the family possessions had 
 not been forfeited to the crown : it was the last relic of Sir 
 Eobert's fortunes. His few tenantry, hard pressed for rent to 
 satisfy his necessities, had deserted their abodes ; the green 
 acres had passed into other hands ; a band of poor cotters alone 
 remained, and this old house haunted by the ghosts of those who 
 slept beneath the waveless pool, dilapidated, disfurnished. l^et 
 here the wild knight had held lawless carousals ; hither he some- 
 times fled to hide after some ruinous loss, or when he was pursued

 by those Tvho souglit to avenge insults committed durmg drunken 
 brawls. 
 
 Xow it would seem some orgie was meditated : liveried ser- 
 vants, one or two only bearing Clifford's coat, the rest wearing 
 different badges, as beloDging to different masters, had arrived 
 during the previous day. Some of the ruined huts were pulled 
 down to supply firewood, and the old chimnies sent out volumes 
 of smoke ; various carts, .laden, some with eatables, fat bucks, 
 young calves, pheasants, hares, and partridges, piles of bread, 
 seven hooped casks of wine, were unladen in the mildew-stained 
 hall. Other carts followed the first, bearing bedding, apparel, 
 furniture, and, it was whispered by the idHng villagers, arms. 
 Several apartments were strewed thick with rushes, and the 
 blazing fires, in spite of the tattered plaster and stained ceilings, 
 imparted cheerfulness to the rooms. There was need of internal 
 warmth ; a thick snow-storm fell, sheeting the low fields, which, 
 uninterspersed by trees, now looked doubly wild and drear. The 
 waters of the moat and pool were frozen ; a sharp north wind 
 whistled round the house. For the first time for many years its 
 poor dependents were cheered during the severe season by the 
 crumbs, or rather large portions of superfluous food, from the 
 mansion of their landlord. 
 
 The first guest that arrived came in a close litter, attended by 
 a Moorish servant, and Clifford himself on horseback. Moniua 
 had forgotten her Flemish home : bright Andalusia — its orange 
 groves, myrtle and geranium hedges, the evergreen forests which 
 embowered Alcala, and the fertile laughing Vega of Granada, 
 formed her image of such portions of fair earth, as, unencum- 
 bered by houses, afforded on its green and various surface 
 sustenance to his inhabitants. She shivered before the northern 
 blast, and gazed appalled on the white plain, where the drifting 
 snow shifted in whole showers as the wind passed over it. The 
 looks of the people, sallow, ill-clothed, and stupid, made her turn 
 from contemplating them, as she yet ansv/ercd the contemptuous 
 and plaintive remarks of her Spanish attendant in a cheerful, 
 deprecating voice. 
 
 For two successive days other guests continued to arrive. 
 They were chiefly men of note, yet came attended by few domes- 
 tics. There was Lord Fitzwater, dissatisfied at the part of rebel 
 he was forced, he thought, to play ; and on that account he was 
 louder than any against King Henry. Sir Simon Mountford 
 was a Yorkist of the days of Edward the Fourth ; he personally 
 bated Eichmond, and looked on Eichard's as a sacred cause. 
 Sir Thomas Thwaites had been a friend of the earl of Elvers, 
 and gladly seized this occasion to avenge his death, attributable

 to the dastardly policy of Henry. William Daubeny was 
 attached to the earl of Warwick, and entered warmly into 
 projects whose success crowned his freedom. Sir Eobert Rat- 
 cliffe, cousin of Lord Fitz water, had lived in poor disguise since 
 the battle of Stoke, and gladly threw off his peasant's attire 
 to act the soldier again in a new war of tlie Roses. Sir Richard 
 Lessey had been chaplain to the household of Edward the 
 Fourth. Sir William Worseley, dean of St. Paul's, was a rare 
 instance of gratitude outliving the period of receiving benefits ; 
 he had been a creature, and was a sincere mourner, of the late 
 queen. Many others, clergy and laity, entered the plot; a 
 thousand different motives impelled them to one line of conduct, 
 and brought them to Clifford's moated house, to conspire the 
 overthrow of Tudor, and the exaltation of the duke of York to 
 the throne. One only person invited to this assembly failed. 
 Sir William Stanley ; each voice was loud against his tergiver- 
 sation, and Clifford's whispered sarcasm cut deeper than all. 
 
 The debates and consultations lasted three days. After infinite 
 confusion and uncertainty, the deliberations brought forth 
 conclusions that were resolved upon unanimously. First, the 
 house they then occupied, and the village, was to be a repository 
 for arms, a rendezvous for the recruits of the cause. The con- 
 spirators levied a tax on themselves, and collected some thousand 
 pounds to be remitted to the prince. They regulated a system, 
 whose object was to re-awaken party-spirit in England, and to 
 quicken into speedy growth the seeds of discontent and sedition, 
 which Henry's avarice and extortion had sown throughout the 
 land. Those who possessed estates and followers were to organize 
 troops. At last, they deputed two of their number to go over 
 to the duchess of Burgundy, and to carry their offers of service 
 to her royal nephew. The two selected for this purpose were, 
 first, Sir Robert Clifford, who had known the duke formerly, and 
 who, it was supposed, would be peculiarly welcome to him ; and 
 secondly. Master William Barley, a man advanced in years ; he 
 had combated in nearly all the twelve pitched and sanguinary 
 battles that were fought between York and Lancaster. He had 
 been a boy-servitor to the old duke of York, a yeoman ot 
 Edward's guard, a halberdier in Richard the Third's time. 
 He had been left for dead on the field of Bosworth, but came to 
 life again to appear at the battle of Stoke. He had risen in the 
 world, and was a man of substance and reputation : he was not 
 noble ; but he was rich, zealous, and honest. 
 
 The meeting lasted three days, and then gradually dispersed. 
 All had gone well. An assembly, whoso individuals were noble, 
 wealthy, or influential, united to acknowledge Richard as their

 liege. roreJ<^n potentates declai'ed for him ; and hope was high 
 in ercry bosom at all these forerunners of success. Monina'a 
 enthusiastic heart beat with ecstasy. Young, the innocent child 
 of unsophisticated impulse, her gladness showed itself in wild 
 spirits and unconstrained expressions of exultation. She and 
 Cliflbrd returned to London together, for he contrived tacitly 
 and unsuspected by her, to install himself as her habitual escort. 
 Happy in expectation of her beloved friend's success, she talked 
 without reserve ; and the genius, which was her soul's essence, 
 gave power and fascination to everything she said. She spoke 
 of Spain, of Hichard's adventures there, of her father and his 
 voyages. The name of Columbus was mentioned ; and the JS^ew 
 World — source of wondrous conjecture. They spoke of the 
 desolate waste of waters that hems in the stable earth — of the 
 golden isles beyond : to all these subjects Monina brought vivid 
 imagery, and bright painting, creations of her own quick fancy. 
 Clifford had never before held such discourse. In hours of sick- 
 ness or distaste, at moments of wild exhilaration, when careeriug 
 on a high-mettled horse beneath the stars of night, fanned by a 
 strong but balmy wind, he had conceived ideas allied to the lofty 
 aspirations of our nature ; but he cast them off as dreams, un- 
 worthy of a wise man's attention. The melodious voice of 
 jMonina, attuned by the divine impulses of her spirit, as the 
 harp of the winds by celestial breezes, raised a commotion in 
 his mind, such as a prophetess of Delphi felt when the oracular 
 vapour rose up to fill her with sacred fury. A word, a single 
 word, was a potent northern blast to dash aside the mist, and to 
 re-apparel the world iu its, to him, naked, barren truth. So fer- 
 vently, and so sweetly did she speak of [Richard, that Clifford's 
 burning heart was in a moment alight with jealousy ; and the 
 love he despised, and thought he mastered, became his tyrant, 
 when it allied itself to his evil passions. He looked angry, he 
 spoke sharply — Monina was astonished; but his libellous insinu- 
 ations fell innocuous on her pure mind : she only felt that she 
 feared him, half-disliked him, and, trembling and laughing as she 
 spoke, said, "Well, well; I will not care for your angry mood. 
 You are going soon : ere you return, our prince will, by his own 
 bright example, have taught you better things. Learn from him 
 diligently, sir knight, for he is all courtesy and nobleness." 
 
 Clifford laughed bitterly, and a base resolve of lowering the 
 high-hearted York to his own degrading level arose in his breast : 
 it was all chaos there as yet ; Ibut the element, which so lately 
 yielded to a regular master-wind of ambition, was tossed in wild 
 and hideous waves by — we will not call the passion love — by 
 jealousy, envy, and growing hate. Short interval was allowed

THE CONSPIENCT. 14-7 
 
 for tlie efatliering of tlie storm ; lie was soon called upon to fiilfil 
 liis commission, and to accompany Z^Iaster William Barley on 
 their important embassy to Brussels. 
 
 The scene here presented, operated a considerable change on 
 these personages ; arriving from England, where the name of the 
 White Eose was whispered, and every act in his favour was hid 
 in the darkness of skulking conspiracy, to his court at Brussels, 
 wliere noble followers clustered round him, and the duchess, 
 with a woman's tact and a woman's zeal, studied how best to 
 give importance and splendour to his person and pretensions. 
 The spirit of the Yorkist party, in spite of her natural mild- 
 ness, still glowed in the bosom of this daughter of Henry the 
 Sixth's unhappy rival, — the child of disaster, and bride of frantic 
 turbulence. Opposed to the remorseless Louis the Eleventh, 
 struggling with the contentious insolence of the free towns of 
 Elanders, war appeared to her the natural destiny of man, and 
 she viLlJcd to its necessitv, while her gentle heart sorrowed 
 
 *' . ..".-1 
 
 over the misery which it vpccasioned. 
 
 She first received Clifford and Barley ; and with the winning 
 grace of a sovereign, solicited for her nephew their affection and 
 support : then she presented them to him — this was the fair- 
 haired, blue-eyed boy, whom Clifford saved, the gentle, noble- 
 looking being, whose simplicity awed him ; whose bright smile 
 said, " I reign over every heart." The knight shrunk into him- 
 self : how had he dyed his soul in a worldliness which painted 
 his countenance in far other colours. — He was not deficient in 
 grace : his dark-grey eyes, veiled by long lashes, were in them- 
 selves exceedingly handsome : the variableness of his face, traced 
 with many unseasonable lines, yet gave him the power of assum- 
 ing a pleasing expression ; and his person, though diminutive, 
 was eminently elegant, while his self-possession and easy address, 
 covered a multitude of faults. Now, his first resolve was to 
 insinuate himself into Eichard's affections; to become a favourite; 
 and consequently to lead him blindly on the path he desired he 
 should tread. 
 
 The prince's spirits were high ; his soul exulted in the attach- 
 ment of others, in the gratitude that animated him. Until 
 Clifford's arrival (Edmund was for the time in England), Sir 
 George Neville, among his new friends, held the first place. He 
 was proud and reserved ; but his aristocracy was so blended with 
 honour, his reserve with perfect attention and deference to the 
 feeling of others, that it was impossible not to esteem him, and 
 find pleasure in his society. Clifford and Neville made harsh 
 discoixi together. Hichard, inexperienced in the world, sought

148 THE CONSPIRACY. 
 
 to liarmonize that "wliicli never could accord : Tfeville drew 
 back ; and Clifford's good liumoiir, and apparent forbearance, 
 made him appear to advantage. 
 
 At this period ambassadors from Henry arrived at Brussels : 
 they had been expected ; and as a measure of precaution, Eichard 
 left that place before their arrival, and took up his temporary 
 abode at Audenarde, a town which made part of the dowry of 
 the Duchess Margaret. All the English, save Lady Brampton, 
 attended him to his retreat. The ambassadors, in their audience 
 with the archduke, demanded the expulsion of Eichard from the 
 Low Countries, taunting the duchess with her support of the 
 notorious impostor, Lambert Simnel, and speaking of the duke 
 of York as a fresh puppet of her own making. They received 
 the concise reply — that the gentleman she recognized as her 
 nephew, inhabited the territory of her dowry, of which she was 
 sovereign, and over which the archduke had no jurisdiction : 
 however, that no disturbance might occur in their commercial 
 relations, which would have roused all Flanders to rebellion, 
 Maximilian was obliged to temporize, and to promise to afford 
 no aid to the illustrious exile. 
 
 Their audience accomplished, the ambassadors had only to 
 return. They remained but one night at Brussels : on this 
 night. Sir Edward Poynings and Doctor Wattam, who fulfilled 
 this mission, were seated over a cup of spiced wine, in discourse 
 concerning these strange events, the Lady Margaret's majestic 
 demeanour, and the strangeness of her supporting this young 
 man, if indeed he were an impostor ; when a cavalier, whose 
 soiled dress and heated appearance bespoke fatigue and haste, 
 entered the room. It was Sir Eobert Clifford : they received 
 him as liege subjects may receive a traitor, with darkened brows 
 and serious looks. Clifford addressed them in his usual careless 
 style : — " Saint Thomas shield me, my masters ; can you not 
 afford one benison to your gossip ! Good Sir Edward, we have 
 ruffled together, when we wore both white and red in our caps ; 
 and does the loss of a blood-stained rag degrade me from your 
 friendship ? " 
 
 The bitter accusations of the knight, and the doctor's sarcasms, 
 which were urged in reply, awoke a haughty smile. " Oh, yes ! " 
 he cried, "ye are true men, faithful liege subjects! I, an 
 inheritance of the block, already marked for quartering, because 
 I am for the weak right, you for the strong might. Eight, I 
 say — start not — the mother of God be my witness ! Duke 
 Eichard is Duke Eichard — is lord of us all — true son of the true 
 king, Ned of the White Eosc, M'hom you swore 'to protect, 
 cherish, and exalt j you, yes, even you, sir knight. Where is

 now your oatli ? cast from lieaven, to pave tlie liell wliere you 
 will reap the meed of your lying treachery ! " 
 
 CiifFord, alvrays insolent, was doubly so now that he felt 
 accused of crimes of which he did not deem himself guilty ; but 
 which would (so an obscure presentiment told him) hereafter 
 stain his soul. Doctor Wattam interposed before Poyning's 
 rising indignation : " Wherefore come you here, Sir E-obert ? " 
 he asked. " Though we are envoys of the king you have 
 betrayed, we may claim respect : Sir Edward, as a gentleman 
 and a cavaher — I as an humble servitor of the Lord Jesus, in 
 whose name I command you not to provoke to a bloody deed 
 the messengers of peace." 
 
 " Cease to taunt me with a traitor's name," replied Sir 
 Eobert, " and I will chafe no further the kindling blood of my 
 sometime friend. Let us rather leave all idle recrimination. I 
 came hither to learn how wagged the world in London town, 
 and, as a piece of secret intelHgence, to assure you that you 
 wrongfully brand this stripling for an impostor. Be he sovereign 
 of our land or not — be it right or wrong to side with York 
 against Lancaster — York he is, the son of Edward and Eliza- 
 beth, so never fail me my good sword or my ready wits ! " 
 
 The best of us are inclined to curiosity. A little fearful of 
 each other, the ambassadors exchanged looks, to know whether 
 either would accuse the other of treachery if they heard further. 
 " Good sir," said the doctor, gravely, " methinks we do our liege 
 service in listening to this gentleman. We can the better 
 report to his majesty on what grounds the diabolic machination 
 is founded." 
 
 So, over another goblet, Clifford sat telling them how Eichard 
 had long lived as Perkin Warbeck in the neighbourhood of 
 Tournay, under the guardianship of Madeline de Faro; and lie 
 recounted the history of his escape from the hands of Erion. 
 Doctor Wattam carefully conned these names ; and then, in 
 reply, he set forth how unworthy it was of a Clifford to desert 
 from Lancaster ; how unlikely, even if it were true, which, after 
 all his tale hardly proved it was, that the outcast boy could 
 compete with success with the sage possessor of England's 
 throne. Poynings asked him how it pleased him to find himself 
 at the same board with a Nevill and a Taylor, and hinted that 
 an exile from his country and a traitor to his sovereign, this was 
 hardly the way to replenish his purse, or to gain anew the broad 
 lands"^he had lost. The service he might do Henry by a return 
 to his duty, gratitude and reward, were then urged by the 
 priest, while Clifford listened in dodged silence. His brow 
 became flushed ; his lips worked with internal commotion. He

 felt, he knovr, that he hated the very man \\hose cause he 
 espoused ; but he was p]cd<j[cd ,to so many, a -vrhole array of 
 noble and respected names came before him. — Could he, in the 
 eyes of these, become a false foul traitor? He refilled, and 
 quaffed aj^ain and attain his cup ; and at last so wound himself 
 up, as to begin, "My friends, you speak sooth, though I may 
 not listen ; yet, if you name one so humble and distasteful, say 
 to my liege — " 
 
 A page in green and Trhitc — the colours of Lady Brampton — 
 entered, announcing her speedy arrival. ChfFord's wits were 
 already disturbed by wine ; instinct made him fear in such a 
 state to come in contact with the subtle lady ; he drew his cap 
 over his eyes, his cloak around his person, and vanished from 
 the hall, ere his friends were aware of his intention. 
 
 The interview between Lady Brampton and the gentlemen 
 was of another sort. Sir Edward had in her younger days worn 
 her colours. She was changed in person since then : but, when, 
 after a short interval, he got over the shock consequent on 
 the first perception of the sad traces of time on the cheek of 
 beauty, he found that her eyes possessed the same fire, her voice 
 the same thrilling tone, her smile the same enchantment. "While 
 the doctor, who had loved her as a daughter, and she regarded 
 him with filial reverence, rebuked her for what he termed her 
 misdeeds ; she replied with vivacity, and such true and zealous 
 love for him whose cause she upheld, that they were both moved 
 to listen with respect, if not conviction, to her asseverations. 
 She could not gain her point, nor win them over to her side ; 
 but, when she departed, neither spoke of young Eichard's 
 rights, unwilling to confess to one another that they were 
 converts to his truth. She went. The next day they departed 
 from Brussels, and it became subject of discussion, what step 
 Henry would now take, and whether, by any new measure, he 
 could disturb the ripening conspiracy against his throne.

 TREASON. 
 
 Oh, what excuse can my invention make ? 
 
 I do aiTcst j'e of high treason here ! 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 Henry's ambassadors liacl ^vroiiglit little cliange on an}'^ except 
 ClifFord. His AA'ords had been interrupted ; they 'oerc nothing 
 in themselves ; but their spirit, the spirit of treason, was in his 
 heart. He made up his mind to nothing ; he looked forward to 
 no certain project; but he felt that hereafter he might betray his 
 present associates to their arch-enemy. As yet his conscience 
 was not seared ; the very anticipation of guilt tortured ]iim, and 
 lie longed to fly from thought. Another blind impulse drove 
 him on. He hated the prince, because he was his opposite ; 
 because, while he was a cankered bloom, his heart a waste, his 
 soul crusted over by deceit, his very person sullied by evil deeds 
 and thoughts, Duke Eichard stood in all the pride of innocence. 
 Could he degrade him to his own level, there would be a pang 
 the less in his bosom; could he injure him in the eyes of his 
 friends, render him, as he himself had ever been, an object of 
 censure, he would satisfy the ill-cravings of his nature, and do 
 Henry a wondrous benefit by tarnishing the high character his 
 rival bore, causing liim whom his adherents set up as an idol, to 
 become a reproach to them. 
 
 Clifford thought that it would be an easy task to entice a gay 
 young stripling into vice. Eichard loved hawking, hunting, and 
 jousting in the lists, almost more, some of his elder friends 
 thought, than befitted one on the eve of a perilous enterprise. 
 Governed by Edmund, attended by Neville, watched by the 
 noble duchess and vigilant Lady Brampton, it was no great 
 wonder that he had hitherto escaped error ; but Clifford went 
 wilily to work, and hoped in some brief luckless hour to undo 
 the work of years. Eichard was glad to find in him a defender 
 of his inclination for manly sports ; an intimacy sprung up

 between tbem, whicli it would not be the Icniglit's fault, if it did 
 not brinor about the catastrophe he desired. 
 
 What then perpetually opposed all his measures? "What, 
 when he thought he had caused the tide of temptation to flow, 
 suddenly made it ebb and retreat back to its former banks ? 
 Clifford, an adept in every art, moulded himself to every needful 
 form, and at last won the secret from the deep recess of Eichard's 
 heart ; he loved — he loved Monina, that living emblem of 
 innocent affection ; never, he had vowed, would he disturb the 
 sacred calm that reigned in her young heart, nor gift ignorance 
 with fatal knowledge. She knew not the nature of her own 
 feelings, and he would not withdraw the veil ; but he was him- 
 self conscious of being swayed by the tenderest love. He could 
 not marry her ; his own misfortunes had arisen from the mis- 
 alliance of his father ; she herself would have refused to injure 
 thus his cause, and have disdained him, if for her sake he had 
 been inclined to abdicate his rights ; he would be her friend, her 
 brother. With passion came sorrrow ; he fled from sad reflec- 
 tion to the chase, to the exercise of arms. But other tempta- 
 tion became blunted by this very sentiment ; his love grew more 
 ardent by restraint ; if he yielded in her absence to the contem- 
 plation of her image, his soul was filled with a voluptuous 
 languor, . from which he roused himself by attention to his 
 duties or hardy pastimes ; but to every other form of pleasure 
 he was cold. This was a strange, incomprehensible picture to 
 present to the world-worn Clifford ; he fancied that it must be a 
 delusion, but he found all the resistance of firm reality. To 
 embitter his defeat came his own fierce passions, and the know- 
 ledge that Monina loved his rival ; they would see each other, 
 be happy in each other, and laugh him to scorn ! He concealed 
 his jealousy, his disappointment ; but double treble rage gnawed 
 at his heart ; hatred awoke in her most viperous shape, fanged 
 by a sense of inferiority, envenomed by envy, sharpened by the 
 torture of defeat. How little did any know — above all, how 
 not at all did his innocent victim suspect — the storm that brooded 
 in his heart ! There was something in the very slightness and 
 grace of his figure that was at variance with the idea of violence 
 and crime ; and his glossing tongue added to the deceit. Lady 
 Brampton feared him a little ; Frion saw something in him, that 
 made him pay greater court to him than to any other — these were 
 the only indications. Sunshine and calm brooded over the earth- 
 quake's birth. 
 
 Meanwhile, Henry was not sleeping at his post. He saw the 
 full extent of his danger, and exerted all liis energy to provide 
 against it. His immediate attention was chiefly directed to two

 points." In the first place it was desirable to foro^e some tale, to 
 a&count for the circumstances that spoke so loudly for the truth 
 of York's story, and thus to degrade him from the high esteem 
 in which he was universally held ; secondly, it became necessary 
 to certify to the public the death of Edward the Fifth and his 
 brother in the Tower. We may well wonder at his ill success as 
 to the first point; — there never was concocted so ill-fangled, so 
 incongruous, and so contradictory a fable, as that put together 
 by Henry, purporting to be the history of the pretender. He 
 was himself ashamed of it, and tried to call it in. History has 
 in its caprice given more credence to this composition, than its 
 contemporaries gave ; it was ridiculed and despised at the time 
 even by the partisans of Lancaster. 
 
 He was equally unfortunate in his second efi'ort. To explain 
 his attempts we must go back to the time of Eichard the Third. 
 On repeated reports being made to him of his unhappy imprisoned 
 nephew's illness, this monarch had commissioned Sir James 
 Tirrel to visit him. The young prince had languished without 
 any appearance of immediate danger, and then suddenly drooped 
 even to the grave. Tirrel arrived at the Tower late in the even- 
 ing, and the first intelligence he received was, that the Lord 
 Edward was dying. At the midnight hour he was admitted 
 into his sick-room ; his two attendants followed him no further 
 than the antechamber. He entered. The glazed eye and death- 
 pale cheek of the victim spoke of instant dissolution; a few- 
 slight convulsions, and it was over — Edward was no more! 
 With wild, loud cries poor little York threw himself on his 
 brother's body. Tirrel's servants, affrighted, entered; they 
 found one of the princes, whose illness had been represented as 
 trivial, dead ; the other was carried off, struggling and screaming, 
 by their master and an attendant priest, the only two persons m 
 the chamber. They departed two hours afterwards from the 
 Tovrer. Tirrel seemed disturbed, and was silent. They would 
 perhaps have thought less about it ; but hearing subsequently 
 of the disappearance and supposed death of the young duke, 
 wonder grew into suspicion, and in thoughtless talk they laid the 
 foundation of a dire tale out of these fragments. Henry had 
 heard it before; now he endeavoured to trace its origin. Tirrel, 
 who for some time had lived obscurely in the country, came to 
 London — he was immediately seized, and thrown into prison. 
 Emissaries were set to work to find the three others, the priest 
 and Sir James's two servants. Only one was to be found; and 
 when Tirrel was asked concerning this man, by nam.e John 
 Dightou, he told a tale of ingratitude punished by him, which 
 was soothing sweet to King Henry's ear; he was speedily

 discovered and imprisoned. Bolk master and follower under- 
 went many examinations : and it was sufigcsted to each, that 
 reward would follow their giving countenance to a tale of mid- 
 night murder. Tirrel was indignant at the proposal ; Dighton, 
 on the contrary — a needy, bad man — while he told the story so 
 as to gloss his own conduct, was very ready to inculpate his 
 master ; and it grew finely under his fosterage. Henry saw 
 that without Tirrel's connivance he could not authenticate any 
 account ; but he gave all the weight he could to these reports. 
 Pew persons believed them, yet it served to confuse and compli- 
 cate events ; and, while peoiple argued, some at least would take 
 his side of the question, and these would be interested to spread 
 their belief abroad j— Duke Eichard must be the loser in every 
 way. 
 
 The spies, the traitor-emissaries of the fear-struck monarch, 
 were all busy ; there was a whole army of them dispersed in 
 England and Flanders — none could know the false man from the 
 true. To obviate every suspicion, he caused his own hirelings 
 to be proclaimed traitors, and cursed at St. Paul's cross. 
 
 The priests, ever his friends, were impiously permitted to 
 violate the sacrament of confession ; and thus several unsus- 
 pecting men betrayed their lives, while they fancied that they 
 performed a religious duty. A few names still escaped him — he 
 tampered with Clifford and Frion for them : the former was not 
 yet quite a villain; the latter found that he enjoyed more 
 credit, honour, and power as the duke's secretary than he could 
 do as Henry's spy ; besides, his vanity was hurt — he wished to 
 revenge himself on the master who had discarded him. 
 
 In nothing did Henry succeed better than in throwing an 
 impenetrable veil over his manoeuvres. Most people thought, 
 so tranquil and unconcerned he seemed, that he did not suspect 
 the existence of an actual conspiracy, fostered in England itself, 
 containing many influential persons among its numbers. All 
 were sure that he was entirely ignorant of their names and actual 
 purposes. The many months which intervened while he waited 
 patiently, corroborated this belief, and the conspirators slept in 
 security. The winter passed, and they continued to scheme, 
 apparently unobserved ; spring came — they prepared for York's 
 landing — for a general rising — for a sudden seizing on many 
 walled towns and fortresses — for the occupation of London itself. 
 A few brief weeks, and Henry's prosperity would be shaken to 
 its centre — his power uprooted — he and his children would 
 wander exiles in a foreign land ; and another king, the gallant 
 descendant of the true Plantagenets, reifjn in his stead. 
 
 ihus occupied, thus prepared, were the Yorkists in England;

 at Brussels, things were carried on more openly, and wore a 
 more promising appearance. The duchess, Lady Brampton, 
 Plantagenet, triumphed. Sir George ^Neville anticipated with 
 proud joy a restoration of the fallen race of Warwick, and 
 regarded himself already as another king-maker of that house. 
 Every exile looked northward, and grew joyful with the thought 
 of home. Frion became more busy and important than ever; 
 he had lately gone disguised to England, in pursuance of some 
 project. In another week they expected Lord Barry to join 
 them from Ireland : ClilFord was amazed, vacillating, terrified. 
 He kn«w that Henry was far from idle ; he was aware that some 
 of the loudest speakers in Eichard's favour in Brussels were his 
 hirelings, whom he would not betray, because he half felt him- 
 self one among them, though he could not quite prevail on him- 
 self to join their ranks. He believed that the king was in eager 
 expectation of his decision in his fa.vour ; that nothing could be 
 done till he said the word ; he proposed conditions ; wished to 
 conceal some names ; exempt others from punishment. Mes- 
 sengers passed continually between him and bishop Morton, 
 Henry's chief counsellor and friend, and yet he could not deter- 
 mine to be altogether a traitor. 
 
 Thus stood affairs ; a consummation all thought to be nigh 
 at hand. It was the spring of 1494, and the coming summer 
 was to decide the fate of York. A ball was given by the duchess, 
 in honour of her nephew ; it was splendidly and gaily attended. 
 Clifford had been conversing with the prince, when suddenly ho 
 left the apartment : it was long ere he came back, and slowl}'- 
 joined the principal group in the room, consisting of the duchess, 
 the prince. Lady Brampton, Neville, Plantagenet, Taylor, and 
 several others. Clifford's countenance was marked by horror 
 and surprise ; so much so, that Lady Brampton looked at him a 
 moment without knowing him. Suddenly she started up and 
 seized his arm — " Holy Virgin ! " she cried, " what had dressed 
 your face, Sir Eobert, in this pale livery ? what tale of death 
 have you heard ? " 
 
 The brow of Clifford became flushed, his lips grew whiter, as 
 quivering they refused to form the words he attempted to utter. 
 Barley had bef^ore this quitted the apartment : he rushed in now, 
 crying aloud, " Treason ! " 
 
 " Treason ! " Neville repeated, laying his hand heavily on 
 Clifford's shoulder; '"'hear you that word, sir knight? Where 
 is the traitor ? " 
 
 Clifford in a moment recovered himself, answering, com- 
 posedly, " A}^ would I could point out the man — would that I 
 could drag him forth, the mark, the very target for the shafts of

 vengeance. We are lost; the cause is lost; our friends; the 
 good Lord Fitzwater. I would have hid his name in the bowels 
 of the earth ! " 
 
 Already the festal hall was deserted ; already the guests were 
 dispersed, to learn how wide the destruction had spread. By 
 the prince's orders, the messenger from England was introduced 
 before himself and his principal friends : it was Adam Floyer, 
 Sir Simon Mountford's chaplain ; escaped himself, he was the 
 bearer of a frightful tale. On one day, almost at the same hour, 
 the Yorkist conspirators were arrested. Lord Fitzwater, Sir 
 Simon Mountford, Sir Thomas Thwaites, Eobert Ea.tcliffe, 
 William Daubeny, Thomas Cressenor, Thomas Astwood, two 
 dominicans, by name William Eichford and Thomas Poyns, 
 Doctor William Sutton, Worseley the dean of Saint Paul's, 
 Bobert Langborne, and Sir William Lessey, were all seized and 
 cast into prison. Others had escaped : young Gilbert Daubeny, 
 brother of Wilham, and Sir Edward Lisle, had arrived in Flan- 
 ders. Others made good speed and had fled to Ireland.

 ''Where is the traitor ?" Neville's question resounded through 
 Flanders, and was re-echoed in groans from the English shores. 
 Each man feared the other, and saw the mark of Henry's malice 
 on the brow of all. It was a worse scene in England : execu- 
 tions followed imprisonment ; the scaffolds flowed with blood ; 
 and suspicion was still greedy of prey. Among the papers seized 
 by the king there was found a letter from Clifford to Lord Fitz- 
 water, containing these words : " I do protest, my lord, that the 
 proof of York's truth is most pertinent. You know this ; and 
 yet he who cut the crooked rose-bush to the roots still doubts ;

 forsooth, he is still at his ' ifs' — ' if he were sure that that young 
 man were King Edward's son, he would never bear arms against 
 him.' Pray deprive my lord of his ' if ;' for arms he must never 
 bear : he is too principal to any cause." 
 
 Henry tormented himself to find who this doubter might be : 
 again he sought to bribe Clifford, who was at first dogged that 
 so much was done without him, and then tried to barter his 
 intelligence for Lord Fitzwater's life. Such grace had he left, 
 that- he was ready to exert his wits to save his former patron ; 
 this was granted. This noble alone of the conspirators who were 
 laymen was spared : he was sent prisoner to Calais. 
 
 At the first word of discovery, Monina's friends had endea- 
 voured to insure her escape to Flanders ; but her name was 
 known to Henry, and there was none whom he was more 
 desirous to get into his power. She remained concealed at 
 a little distance from London. She grew mad in inaction : 
 the work of death and misery around wound up her tender 
 spirit to torture ; and the execution of her former friends filled 
 her with such horror as made day hateful, night the parent of 
 frightful visions. After several weeks' seclusion, she all at once 
 resolved to visit London, to seek some one of her former friends 
 — to learn whether the tragedy was over, and what further 
 mischiefs despair might have engendered. She inhabited a 
 solitary mansion, with one old woman, who opposed her going, 
 but vainly. Monina was too young to bear uncertainty with any 
 degree of patience. Some slight joy visited her as she found 
 herself on her road to London. Before she arrived a heavy rain 
 fell ; but she was not to be discouraged. Sir Edward Lisle, she 
 knew, had not been arrested : she was unaware of his escape, 
 and thought perhaps that he had not been discovered ; she 
 might get intelligence from him. His house was deserted and 
 empty. Another hope remained — Sir William Stanley. She 
 knew his timidity, and resolved to be cautious as to the manner 
 of her visit. Sir "vYilliam had ever been peculiarly kind to the 
 gentle maiden ; fearing to see her openly, she had often come to 
 him by water : his mansion, near the palace at Westminster, had 
 a garden upon the Thames. Without exciting any remark, she 
 could land here. It was already night, and this favoured secrecy. 
 With some difficulty, in the city, where she then was, she con- 
 trived to find her way to an obscure wharf, and embarked in a 
 wherry. Fortunately it was high water, and she landed without 
 difficulty in the garden, and dismissed the men. Kow she began, 
 to be puzzled as to how she should make her way, dripping with 
 rain, unexpected, to Sir WiUiam's presence. She had been 
 accustomed to be admitted by a little door opening on stairs

 whicli led her to her old friend's library : this was shut noTV. 
 Suddenly she thoun^ht she heard voices, and then perceive'd a 
 thread of light that streamed through the key-hole of the 
 summcr-hoiiso in the garden. There was a noise on the water, 
 too : and a boat was paddled to the landing-place. Bewildered, 
 yet believing that all this secrecy was connected with the grand 
 conspiracy, she moved towards the summer-house : the door was 
 opened, and the light falling full upon her, she saw several figures 
 within, and a female shriek burst upon her ear. Quick steps 
 were heard behind : to retreat or go forward equally terrified 
 her ; when one of the persons in the summer-house, a man in an 
 uncouth foreign garb, cried, " Thou here, Monina ! "What 
 miracle is this ? Come, come in ; there is danger in all we 
 do!" 
 
 Monina recognized the voice of Frion, and entered : there 
 she saw one, a lady richly attired, yet half disguised in a large 
 black cloak. Fear was painted on her cheek ; her blue eyes 
 were cast up to Heaven. A female attendant with her seemed 
 yet more terrified. About the room were scattered globes and 
 astrolabes, and all the gear of an astrologer. In tlie lady, 
 Monina recognized York's sister, Tudor's queen, the fair Eliza- 
 beth of England. At once compassion and respect entered her 
 heart : she addressed the royal lady with reverence, and all that 
 touching grace that was her sweetest charm ; siie assured her of 
 inviolable secrecy ; she reminded her of their former interview. 
 Elizabeth grew calmer as she recognized her visitor at Shene : 
 she stretched out her hand to the Spaniard, saying, " I do 
 indeed believe and trust thee ; thou shalt hear again from me." 
 Then folding her mantle round her, and leaning on her attendant, 
 she quitted the house, and with trembling haste embarked. 
 
 For many weeks after this scene, Monina continued concealed 
 in Sir William Stanley's mansion. When the arrest of the con- 
 spirators had taken place, Frion, balked in an attempt to escape, 
 for safety's sake had assumed the habit and character of au 
 astrologer, and so far worked upon Stanley's fears, and won him 
 by his flattery, that he permitted him to take up his residence in 
 his summer-house. Frion was a clever prophet, and too restless 
 not to become notorious. It was a good mode, he averred, to 
 put hope in the hearts of the Yorkists, by prognosticating all 
 manner of success to them. His fame spread. The queen ques- 
 tioned Stanley about his new astrologer ; and the confusion the 
 poor chamberlain evinced, served only to excite her curiosity. 
 She sent one of her attendants to see what manner of man he 
 might be ; and the subtle Frion jorofited by this little artifice, 
 which Sir William in his terror divulged, to entice the queeu

 herself to his cell. She came, and the result of her visit was to 
 bring Moniua again before her. 
 
 Such were the agents still at work for York in London. Such 
 the materials Clifford strove to mould into a purpose of his own. 
 There was no reason, so many of the White Eose thought, to 
 forego all their plans because one had come to a fatal end. Still 
 Eichard might land in England, and make head against Tudor. 
 On a smaller scale, with lessened hopes and diminished ardour, 
 a scheme of this kind was canvassed. Clifford appeared its chief 
 abettor, and encouraged it by every means in his power ; none 
 were averse. It was not an enterprise of such high expectation 
 as the discovered one ; but, undertaken with speed, and prose- 
 cuted with energy, it might turn out as well. England was by 
 no means tranquil ; the metropolis itself was the scene of 
 tumults : these were raised to a ferment by the embargo Henry 
 had found it necessary to place on all communication with 
 Holland-^a measure fraught with ruin to many of the richest 
 merchants in London. 
 
 At this time, towards the end of the summer, the king camo 
 up from his palace at Shene, and held a court at Westminster. 
 One of the immediate subjects that brought him up, was a 
 tumult in the city, to which the embargo had given rise. A 
 vast number of apprentices and journeymen belonging to the 
 ruined merchants were out of employ, while the traders from 
 Hans, and other free German towns, who went among us by 
 the name of the Easterlings, got the commerce into their own. 
 hands, and grew rich upon it. The sight of their prosperity 
 was, to the starving Londoners, as the pressed rowel of a spur 
 in a horse's side ; with the usual barbarism of the untaught and 
 rude, they visited on these men the fault of their governors — 
 the discontent augmented till it became loud, furious, and 
 armed. Multitudes of those deprived of their usual means, met, 
 and, in a moment of rage, proceeded from words to acts. They 
 endeavoured to force and rifle the warehouses of the Easterlings, 
 •who repulsed them with difficulty ; nor did they disperse, till 
 the mayor arrived with men and weapons, from whom they fled 
 like a flock of sheep. When tidings of this event were brought 
 to Henry, he, who saw in all things the multiplied image of the 
 abhorred White Eose, believed the Yorkists to be its secret 
 cause. The day after his arrival he gave audience to the mayor, 
 who reported that, from every examination made, none 
 appeared to have a part in it, except servants and appren- 
 tices, nearly a hundred of whom were imprisoned in the 
 Tower. 
 
 In giving a detail of this circumstance, the mayor related that

 the Easterlings declared, tliat at the first onset their richest 
 store-chambers must have become the prey of the rioters, but 
 for the interposition of one man. He was a sea-captain, and 
 had arrived but the day before with his caravel from Spain — 
 they represented him as a person of gigantic stature and super- 
 human strength. Entangled by the mob in his progress through 
 the city, he had no sooner discovered their intent, than he con- 
 trived to make his way into the stilyard ; and there combining 
 the forces of the defenders, more by his personal prowess than 
 any other means, he beat back the invaders, and succeeded in 
 closing the gates. At the representation of the mayor, Henry 
 commanded that this man should be brought before him, partly 
 that he might thank him for his services, and partly, for Henry 
 was curious on such points, to learn from him the news from 
 Spain, and if more had been heard of the wild visionary 
 Columbus and his devoted crew, since they had deserted the 
 stable continent, to invade the hidden chambers of the secret 
 western ocean. 
 
 The king received the mariner in his closet. ISTone were in 
 attendance save Urswick. There was something grand in the 
 contrast between these men. The courtier-priest — the sove- 
 reign, whose colourless face was deep-lined with careful thought, 
 whose eyes were skilled in reading the thoughts of men, and 
 whose soul was perpetually alive to everything that was passing 
 around him — and the ocean rock, the man of tempests and hard- 
 ships, whose complexion was darkened and puckered by exposure 
 to sun and wind, whose every muscle was hardened by labour, 
 but whose imservile mien bespoke no cringing to any power, 
 save nature's osVn. He received Henry's thanks with respect, 
 and replied simply : he ansv.-ered also several questions put to 
 him concerning his voyages ; it appeared that he had but lately 
 arrived from Spain — that he came to seek a relative who resided 
 in England. During this interview a thought flashed on Henry's 
 mind. In his late transactions ■v^•ith Clifford, the base purpose 
 had been formed of enticing the duke and his principal ad- 
 herents to England, and of delivering them up to their enemy ; 
 there had been some discussion as to providing, at least, one 
 vessel in Henry's pay, to make part of the little fleet which 
 would bring the duke of York over. This was difficult, as 
 suspicion might attach itself to any English vessel; but here 
 was one, with a stranger captain, and a foreign crew, a man who 
 knew njothing of White or Red Kose, who would merely fulfil

 appointed another interview with the stranger.

 Spanish captain had penetrated to the queen's apartments ; and 
 little Arthur, her gentle and darling son, was desirous to see 
 the countrymen of Columbus, whose promised discoveries were 
 the parent of such wonder and delight throughout the world. 
 The prince of Wales must not be denied this pleasure, and the 
 Spaniard was ushered into the queen's presence. An enthusiast 
 in his art, his energetic, though simple expressions enchanted 
 the intelligent prince, and even compelled the attention of his 
 little sturdy brother Henry. He spoke in words, borrowed 
 from Columbus's own lips, of translucent seas, of an atmosphere 
 more softly serene than ours, of shores of supernal beauty, of 
 the happy natives, of stores of treasure, and the bright hopes 
 entertained concerning the further quest to be made in these 
 regions. Elizabeth forgot herself to listen, and regretted the 
 necessity of so soon dismissing him. She asked a few questions 
 relative to himself, his vessel ; " She was a gallant thing once," 
 replied her commander, " when I took her from the Algerines, 
 and new-christened her the Adalid; because, like her owner, 
 being of Moorish origin she embraced the true faith. My own 
 name, please your grace, is Hernan de Faro, otherwise called 
 the Captain of the Wreck, in memory of a sad tedious adven- 
 ture, many years old." 
 
 " De Faro — had he not a daughter ? " 
 
 Anxiety and joy showed itself at once in the mariner's 
 countenance. Monina ! — Where was she? How eagerly and 
 vainly had he sought her — faltering, the queen had only power 
 to say, that Sir William Stanley, the lord chamberlain, could 
 inform him, and, terrified, put an end to the interview. 
 
 Two days after — already had De Faro found and fondly 
 embraced his beloved child — Urswick, at the king's command, 
 sent for the hero of the stilyard, and, after some questioning, 
 disclosed his commission to him ; it was such, that, had de Faro 
 been in ignorance, would have led him to suspect nothing — he 
 was simply to sail for Ostend ; where he would seek Sir 
 [Robert Clifford, and deliver a letter : he was further told that 
 he was to remain at Sir Robert's command, to receive on board 
 his vessel whoever the knight should cause to embark in her, 
 and to bring them safely to England. To all this De Faro, 
 aware of the dread nature of these orders, assented ; and, in 
 Stanley's summer-house, with the lord chamberlain, Monina, 
 and Frion, it was discussed how this web of treason could best 
 be destroyed. There was little room for doubt ; Monina 
 resolved to sail with her father, to denounce Clifford to the 
 prince, and so save him and his friends from the frightful

 snare. Frion still remained in Enorland,. to try to fathom the 
 ■whole extent of the mischief intended ; though now, fearful of 
 discovery, he quitted his present abode, and sought a new 
 disguise. Stanley trembled at Clifford's name, but he saw no 
 suspicion in his sovereign's eye, and was reassured. 
 
 The Adalid sailed, bearing the king's letters to Clifford, and 
 having Monina on board, who was to unfold to the deceived 
 prince and his followers the dangers that menaced them. 
 
 Already, as the appointed time drew near, most of Richard's 
 partizans were assembled at Ostend ; a fleet of three vessels was 
 anchored in the port to convey them to England to fated death ; 
 the prince himself, with Clifford, sojourned in a castle at no great 
 distance. Sir Eobert insinuated himself each day more and more 
 into his royal friend's confidence ; each day his hatred grew, and 
 he fed himself with it to keep true to his base purpose ; among 
 the partizans of York sometimes he felt remorse ; beside the 
 brijjht contrast of his own dark self, never. 
 
 Monina landed ; and, the prince being absent, first she sought 
 Lady Brampton — she was at Brussels ; then Plantagenet, — he 
 was expected, but not arrived from Paris ; then she asked for 
 Sir George Neville, as the chief of the English exiles ; to him 
 she communicated her strange, her horrid tidings, to him she 
 showed Henry's still sealed letter to Clifford. What visible 
 Providence was here, laying its finger on the headlong machinery 
 that was bearing them to destruction ! Neville was all aghast : 
 he, who did not like, had ceased to suspect Clifford, seeing that 
 he adhered to them at their worst. He lost no time in bringing 
 Monina to the castle, but ten miles distant, where York then 
 •was ; he introduced her privately, and, wishing that she should 
 tell her tale herself, went about to contrive that, without Clif- 
 ford's knowledge or suspicion, the prince should have an inter- 
 view with her. 
 
 Monina did not wonder that her bosom throbbed wildly, as 
 she remained in expectation of seeing her childhood's playfellow, 
 from whom she had been so long absent. Nor did she check 
 her emotion of intense pleasure when she saw himrand heard 
 him in her native Spanish utter expressions of glad delight at so 
 unexpectedly beholding her. Time had changed him very little ; 
 his aspect was still boyish ; and, if more thought was seated in 
 his eye, his smile was not the less frank and sweet ; she was 
 more altered ; her but little feminine form had acquired grace ; 
 the girl was verging into the woman — blooming as the one, tender 
 and impassioned as the other ; her full dark eyes, which none 
 could behold and not feel the very inner depths of their nature 
 stirred, were the home of sensibility and love. A few moments

 were given to an intercliange of affectionate greeting, and then 
 York, recurring to the mysterious mode in which Neville had 
 expressed himself, asked if anything save a kind wish to visit 
 the brother of her childhood had brought her hither ; she re- 
 plied^ by relating to him the circumstances of her father's com- 
 mission from Henry, and delivering to him the letter for Sir 
 Robert. The whole wide world of misery contains no pang so 
 great as the discovery of treachery where we pictured truth ; 
 death is less in the comparison, for both destroy the future, and 
 one, with Gorgon countenance, transforms the past. The world 
 appeared to slide from beneath the prince, as he became aware 
 that Clifford's smiles were false ; his seeming honesty, his dis- 
 course of honour, the sympathy apparent between them, a lie, a 
 painted lie, alluring him by fair colours to embrace foulest defor- 
 mity. The exceeding openness and confidence of his own nature, 
 rendered the blow doubly unnatural and frightful ; and Monina, 
 who had half disliked, and latterly had almost forgotten Clifford, 
 was full of surprise and pain to mark the affliction her friend's 
 countenance expressed. 
 
 There was no time for regret. Neville interrupted them, and 
 it became necessary to act. Hichard held in his hand the sealed 
 proof of his associate's falsehood ; Sir George urged him to open 
 it, so as to discover the whole extent of the treason. The prince's 
 eyes were at once lighted up by the suggestion : no, no, because 
 Clifford had been base, he would violate no law of honour — there 
 was no need for the sake of others ; his treachery discovered, 
 was fangless ; nor would he even undertake the dark office of 
 ppenly convicting and punishing : his conscience and remorse 
 should be judge and executioner. 
 
 Monina and Neville returned to Ostend. The prince sent a 
 message to Clifford with some trifling commission to execute in 
 the same town ; and Sir Robert, who had heard of the arrival of 
 a stranger caravel from England, was glad of an opportunity, to 
 ride over to learn its character. His feet were in the stirrups, 
 when a page brought him a letter from the duke, which he was 
 bid not to open till he had departed. A sense of a mysterious 
 meaning came over him. Was he discovered ? At the first dawn 
 of this suspicion he clapped spurs to his horse, and was already 
 far away j then, impatient of uncertainty, as soon as half the 
 brief space to Ostend was measured, he took out the packet, 
 eyed it curiously, and, after many qualms and revolutions of 
 feeling, suddenly tore it open. King Henry's despatch, written 
 in Urswick's well-known hand, first met his eye. Worse in 
 action than in thought, a cold dew mantled on his brow; and,

 while his heart stood still in his labouring breast, he cast his 
 eyes over a few lines, written in Eichard's fair clear Spanish 
 hand : — 
 
 " This paper, joined to the mode in which it fell into my 
 hands, accuses you of treason. If wrongfully, accord permission 
 that the seal may be broken, and your innocence proved. 
 
 "Even it the mystery which this letter contains cannot be 
 divulged nor exculpated, all is not lost. Perhaps you are rather 
 weak than guilty ; erring, but not wicked. If so, return imme- 
 diately on your steps ; by a frank confession merit my confidence. 
 I were unworthy of the mediation of the Blessed Saints, whom 
 each night I solicit to intercede for me before our Heavenly 
 Father, were I not ready to pardon one who has sinned, but 
 who repents. 
 
 " If your crime be of a deeper dye, and you are allied in soul 
 to my enemy, depart. It is enough for me that I never see you 
 more. If I remain a fugitive for ever, you will lose nothing by 
 deserting my ruined fortunes ; if I win the day, my first exercise 
 of the dearest prerogative of kings, will be to pardon you.

 One of the surest results of guilt is to deprive the criminal of 
 belief in the goodness of others. Clifford was discovered. Even, 
 if Eichard continued true to his promise of pardon, his adherents 
 and counsellors might force him to another line of conduct. A 
 dunjj^eon and death floated terribly before his confused vision. 
 Plight, instant flight to England, where, by a full confession of

 many things he had reserved, and the disclosure of an important 
 unsuspected name, he might still receive welcome and reward 
 from Henry, was the only course left him to pursue. 
 
 His thoughts were chaos. Shame and indignation raged in 
 his heart. He was a convicted traitor, a dishonoured man. 
 ** Ob, my envied father ! " in his wretchedness he exclaimed, 
 " you died gloriously for Lancaster. I live, steeped in obloquy, 
 for the same cause. Abhorred Plantagenet ! what misery has 
 been mine since first your name came to druf? me with rackin"- 
 poison ! What have I not endured while I cringed to the fair- 
 haired boy! Thank the powers of hell, that time is past! 
 Devil as I have stamped myself, his arch crime, lying, is no 
 more my attribute. To the winds and men's thirsty ears I may 
 cry aloud — I hate Plantagenet ! " 
 
 It was some relief to this miserable man to array his thoughts 
 in tlieir darkest garb, soothing his evil passions with words, 
 which acted on them as a nurse's fondling talk to a querulous 
 child. His line of conduct was fixed : he remembered Neville's 
 sudden appearance and departure the night before ; he had 
 brought the letter ; he was waiting for him at Ostend to seize on 
 him, to turn to mockery the prince's promised pardon. Those 
 were days of violence and sudden bloodshed : the enemy a man • 
 could not visit with legal punishment, he thought himself 
 justified in destroying with his own hand ; the passions of the 
 Yorkists, who found they had been driven into shambles instead 
 of a fold, must be fierce and dangerous. Without delay, he 
 resolved to embark in one of the vessels then in the roads ; 
 he hurried to the beach ; the wind seemed fair ; there was a poor 
 kind of hostelry, the common resort of sailors near, from whence 
 a signal could be given for a boat to be sent off for him. While 
 waiting for it, he quitted the noisy vulgarity of the inn, and 
 walked towards a kind of ruined tower, that once perhaps had 
 served as a lighthouse. In all the panic of guilt, a roof, how- 
 ever desolate, appeared a shelter, and he sought it : it was 
 dilapidated and dark ; there were some rude, narrow stairs 
 leading to the upper story,— these he ascended, and entered what 
 had been a kind of guard-room, and started at the vision he 
 beheld : leaning against the aperture that had served for a 
 casement, looking on the wide green sea, was Moniua. Her 
 lustrous eyes turned on him — eyes before whose full softness his 
 violence, his insolence quailed ; till shame, despair, and rage, and 
 the deep-seated arrogance of his nature, conquered his better 
 feelings. She knew his crime, witnessed his disgrace ; there was 
 no more to lose in the world. What more could he win ? His 
 presence occasioned her much emotion. She had just quitted

166 THE TEAITOE UNMASKED. 
 
 Neville, who somewhat angrily remarked upon the prince's ill- 
 timed lenity, and spoke bitterly of all the ill Clifford, thus let 
 loose, might do in England. And here he was, about to embark 
 for that very island, where one at least, Sir William Stanley, was 
 at his mercy. Gladly Monina seized on this opportunity to dive 
 into his projects, and to inspire by her energetic words the 
 traitor's bosom with some sense of right. She, alas ! inspired 
 passion only, and jealousy, that now at last his rival would see 
 her love-lighted eyes turned affectionately on him ; while all the 
 reproach of which they were capable was his meed. What such 
 men as Clifford feel is not love : he had no real friendship for the 
 innocent girl ; each feeling that expresses the sympathy of our 
 intellectual nature was never associated to him with the name of 
 woman. As she spoke therefore of his duties to God and man, 
 violated, but not irretrievably, and with soft persuasion entreated 
 him to spare those whose lives hung upon his word, he recovered 
 his obduracy, and replied in a tone whose hollow vaunting was at 
 discord with the music that fell from her lips — "My pretty 
 maiden, I thank thee for thy good intentions, and if thou wilt 
 wholly undertake my instruction, will prove an apt scholar. 
 Honesty and I are too poor to be messmates ; but if thou wilt 
 join us— by God, Mbniua, I mean what I say — the priest shall 
 say grace for us, and we will partake life's feast or fast together. 
 I will sail with thee to thy Spain, to the Indies of the West. 
 England shall be a forgotten name ; the White or Eed Eoso, 
 neither worse nor better in our eyes than any blooms that smell 
 as sweet: if thou refusest this, here ends the last chance for 
 honesty ; and be the victim who it may, I care not so my fortunes 
 thrive." 
 
 " Unworthy man ! " cried Monina ; " farewell ! I go to Eng- 
 land also : I to save, you to destroy. Bounteous Heaven will 
 look on our several intentions, and shape our course accordingly. 
 Henry will visit with poor thanks your blighted purpose, barren 
 now of its ill fruit. Mine will be the harvest; yours the 
 unlamented loss." 
 
 She would have passed him, but he seized her slender wrist. 
 ** We will run no race," he cried ; " if we go to England, it will 
 be together : listen to the splash of oars, it is my boat among the 
 breakers. We enter it together ; it is vain for you to resist ; you 
 are my prisoner." 
 
 Monina trembled in every joint : she felt that in very truth 
 she was in Clifford's power. There rode her father's caravel ; but 
 he could not guess her pressing danger : he would behold her 
 depart, ignorant of the violence she was suffering, ignorant that 
 she was there. JN'o help ! — no form of words was there, that

 mi^ht persuade the ill-minded knight to free her: her proud 
 spirit disdained to bend ; her cheek was flushed ; she strove to 
 withdraw her hand. " Pardon me," said Clifford ; " if my fingers 
 press too roughly ; the slight pain you endure will hardly coun- 
 terbalance the fierce torture your words inflicted. Be patient, 
 my fellows are already here. Let us not act a silly mime before 
 them ; do not oblige me to demonstrate too unkindly, that you 
 are wholly in my power." 
 
 Hardly had he spoken the words when with a scream she 
 sprang from him. He turned ; but before even he could see the 
 gigantic form of De Earo, a blow was struck which made him 
 reel against the wall. It would have been instantly followed by 
 another, but that Monina had flung herself on her father's breast, 
 and he, supporting her, forgot his enemy, who recovered himself, 
 and drew his sword. He met the fi.erce glare of the injured 
 parent's eye, and shook. " We meet again, recreant ! " were the 
 only words spoken by De Faro ; and, as an elephant might snatch 
 a youngling antelope from the pursuit of a tiger, he took his 
 daughter in his armg, descended the steps with her, and, as Clifford 
 stood gazing on the sea, in such bitter mood as is the fruit of 
 baffled malice, he saw the mariner lift his daughter into the boat. 
 It pushed from the shore ; and, with long, measured strokes, it 
 swept the waves towards the caravel, whose sails were again 
 unfurled, while everything bespoke the readiness and anxiety of 
 the crew to depart. 
 
 Ere the Adalid had reached the open sea, Clifford in his vessel 
 was but little astern. It was a race they ran. The caravel at 
 first had the best. Night concealed them from each other's 
 view ; and, in the morning, already on the tranquil bosom of the 
 Thames Sir Robert's vessel was sailing alone towards London. 
 By one of those strange turns of fortune by which our purposes 
 swim or are wrecked, De Faro, without a pilot, unacquainted 
 with the coast, missed the channel ; he grounded on a sand-bank 
 at the river's mouth ; and the tide which carried Clifford so 
 swiftly towards London had several hours to run before it 
 reached a height sufficient to float the other's vessel ; the situation 
 was not without peril, and no boat even could be lowered to carry 
 the anxious Monina to shore. 
 
 The very day (it was now the month of January) that Henry 
 heard of Clifford's arrival in London, he removed his court from 
 Westminster to the Tower. Already he divined that his Lord 
 Chamberlain was to be criminated by Sir Robert; and, as Stanley 
 possessed considerable influence in the state, he wished to make 
 his arrest as unexpected as possible. Another motive worked 
 upon the avaricious sovereign j seized thus, without preparation

 or forethouglit, his jewels, bis rich plate, his valuable moveables, 
 which might otherwise be secreted, now fell the indiscriminate 
 prey of confiscation ; the Tower, at once a palace and a prison, 
 favoured this purpose. Here he received Clifford ; Urswick had 
 already conversed with the traitor knight, and represented to 
 him the necessity of ample confession. There was something in 
 the priest's manner that, like iron, entered Clifford's soul; he 
 felt himself, too truly, to be the abject slave, the despised tool of 
 power; there was but little need to use cajoleries or bribes with 
 him now ; he was there, to be executed as a felon or pardoned 
 as a spy, according as his disclosures satisfied or not the callous- 
 hearted king. 
 
 For his greater punishment, there clung to this unfortunate 
 man a sense of what he ought to and might have been, and a 
 burning consciousness of what he was. Hitherto he had fancied 
 that he loved honour, and had been withheld, as by a hair, from 
 overstepping the demarcation between the merely reprehensible 
 and the disgraceful. The good had blamed him ; the reckless 
 wondered at his proficiency in their own bad lessons ; but hitherto 
 he had lifted his head haughtily among them, and challenged any 
 man to accuse him of worse than greater daring in a career all 
 travelled at a slower and more timid pace. 
 
 But that time was gone by. He was now tainted by leprous 
 treachery ; his hands were stained by the blood of his deceived 
 confederates ; honour disowned him for her son ; men looked 
 askance on him as belonging to a pariah race. He felt this ; and 
 even Monina, who had last conversed with him in the summer- 
 house of the inn at Ostend, would hardly have recognized him. 
 He was then a bold-faced villain ; his step was haughty ; his 
 manner insolent. Now his gait was shuffling, his appearance 
 mean, his speech hesitating and confused. Urswick had known 
 him a gay ruffler ; he started back : was this Sir Robert Clifford ? 
 He was obliged to use with him the usual style of speech adopted 
 towards men in his situation ; to speak of his duty towards his 
 liege ; the propriety of delivering up the guilty to condign 
 punishment : hackneyed phrases, which sounded cold to the 
 unhappy man. 
 
 There was no resource. At Henry's feet, kneeling before a 
 king -^ho used him as a tool, but who hated him as the abettor 
 of his rival, and despised him as the betrayer of his friend, Clifford 
 spoke the fatal word which doomed the confiding Stanley to 
 instant death, himself to the horrors of conscious guilt, or, Avhat 
 as yet was more bitter to the worldling, relentless outlawry from 
 the society and speech of all, however depraved, who yet termed 
 themselves men of honour,

 Henry Leard him with feigned amazement ; and with grating 
 words of insulting unbelief, demanded evidence of his chamber- 
 lain's treason : these were easily furnished, yet such as they were, 
 they comprised such irrefragable proof of the identity of the out- 
 cast duke, that Henry found, that while they confirmed him 
 more than ever in his resolve that Stanley should suffer the 
 severest penalty of his crime, it made it difficult to bring forward 
 the testimonials of his guilt. This was for after consideration : 
 Chfford was dismissed with cold thanks, with promise of pardon 
 and reward, and a haughty command neither to obtrude himself 
 again into the royal presence, nor to depart from London without 
 especial leave. 
 
 Henry's first act was to command Stanley not to quit his 
 chamber in the Tower. The next day before the hour of noon, 
 the Bishop of Durham, Lord Oxford, Lord Surrey, Urswick, and 
 Lord Dawbeny, met in the fallen chamberlain's apartment, for 
 the purpose of examining him. A thousand opposing feelings 
 operated upon Stanley: accustomed to pay deference to the king, 
 even now he said nothing to displease him" ; and his expressions 
 rather spoke of compassion for him who very possibly was duke 
 of York, than any falling off from his aillegiance to the then kino- 
 of England. 
 
 This monarch was tormented by no doubts, — to be actuated 
 by no pity. Stanley's acknowledgment of the truth of the 
 Burgundian pretender roused his bitterest feelings. In addition, 
 he was rich booty — which weighed heavily against him ; so that, 
 when Bishop Fox remarked on the villany and extent of his 
 treason, Henry, off his guard, exclaimed — " I am glad of it ; the 
 worse the better : none can speak of mercy now, and confisca- 
 tion is assured j" — nor did he in the interval before his trial, nor 
 after it, express one regret that the man was about to forfeit his 
 head, who had encircled his own with the regal diadem. 
 
 Tried, condemned ; but a few days remained before on the 
 fatal block the rich, noble, prudent, royally-connected Sir William 
 Stanley would expiate his guilt to Henry. All wondered : many 
 pitied ; few thought of soliciting for or aiding the fallen man ; 
 yet one or two there were, whom this last blow against York 
 filled with bitter regret. In a secluded part of London Lord 
 Barry, who had just arrived, Frion, and Monina met. Barry 
 came with intelligence that there had appeared in Ireland a 
 gentleman from Scotland, commissioned by its young monarch to 
 inquire into the truth of Eichard's story; and, if indubitably he 
 were the man he pretended, to counsel him to visit Scotland, 
 where he would find friendship and^aid. The Earl of Desmond 
 also had just arrived in London, and Lord Barry was in hia

 company. This downfall of Stanley called their minds from 
 every other consideration. Monina was peculiarly agitated and 
 thoughtful. One evening she joined them late : she was full of 
 some project. " I can, I do believe, save our friend," she said : 
 "the assistance I need is small — you, Master Stephen, will 
 hasten on board the Adalid, and bid my father have all in readi- 
 ness, for sailing, and to drop down the river as far as Greenwich : 
 you, my dear lord, must also take a part in my scheme — keep 
 watch on the river, right opposite the Tower, during the coming 
 night and the following : if you see a light upon the shore beneath 
 its dark walls, come towards it with a boat ; the blessed Virgin 
 aiding my design, it shall be freighted with disappointment to 
 the Tudor, joy to us." 
 
 Lord Barry and Frion promised obedience, though they would 
 have dissuaded her from the risk ; but she was devoted, enthusi- 
 astic, firm : she left them, nor did they delay to execute her 
 commission, and both went down the river to De Faro's caravel. 
 Here a new surprise awaited them. The duke of York and his 
 friends had not been idle in the interim. Each design, as it 
 failed, gave place to another. They were diminished in numbers, 
 but now no traitors were among them. Their hopes were few ; 
 but, unless the present time were seized, there would be none. 
 The false expectations Clifford had held out to them of coalition 
 and succour in England were lost, but attachment to York was 
 alive in many an English bosom : the preparations of arms they 
 had made still existed ; it was resolved therefore in early spring 
 to descend on the English shores. 
 
 The duke of York, deeply grieved by the ruin that visited his 
 friends, stung to the heart by Clifford's treachery, resolved 
 meanwhile to seek relief in action. Could not his presence do 
 much ? Unknown in England, he might visit the Yorkists, rouse 
 their affection, and form such a union, as, assisted afterwards by 
 his friends and their little fleet, would contribute to insure 
 success. His friends did not approve of the hazard to which 
 he exposed himself ; but everything they alleged on this score, 
 only conftrmed his purpose. " All endanger themselves — all die 
 forme," he cried ; "shall I alone be ingloriously safe ?" The 
 first sight therefore that presented itself to Lord Barry and Frion 
 on the deck of the Adalid, was Prince Eichard and Edmund 
 Plantagenet. 
 
 The duke's presence did not change the purpose of Frion'a 
 visit. De Faro got his vessel in readiness for the voyage ; and 
 Lord Barry, as evening closed in, prepared to take his stand- 
 not singly : Richard insisted on sharing his watch ; docile as he 
 usually was, remonstrance had now no effect ; hitherto he had

 given himself up to guarded safety, now he seemed in love with 
 peril, resolved to court her at every opportunity. The risk to 
 which Monina exposed herself, made him obstinate. He would 
 have thoucrht himself untrue to the laws of chivalry, a recreant 
 knight, had he not hastened to protect her ; and, more than this — 
 for the inborn impulses of the heart are more peremptory than 
 men's most sacred laws — he loved ; and a mother draws not more 
 instinctively her first-born to her bosom, than does the true and 
 passionate lover feel impelled to hazard even life for the sake of 
 her he loves, to shield her from every danger, or to share them 
 gladly with her. 
 
 CHAPTER XXIV. 
 
 THE TOWEK. 
 
 I do not like the Tower of any place. 
 
 ' Shakspeare. 
 
 At nine o'clock in the evening, York and Lord Barry took their 
 station on the Thames, at the appointed place. The boat was 
 tethered to the shore ; and the rising tide brought them nearer 
 to the banks. All was dark during the cold night of early 
 February ; to the right and left, nothing was apparent save the 
 glimmering water, and the only sound was the rushing and 
 rippling of the Thames, as it sped downward in its course. 
 
 " My mother greets me with a cold kiss," said the prince ; 
 " in truth she has wedded mine enemy, and cast me out from 
 my inheritance." 
 
 A brief pause ensued — a few minutes, which were freighted 
 with tne cares and sorrows of years. Back, back, young Richard 
 threw his eye over the skeleton shapes of the dead years ; and 
 again he sought to penetrate the future. Dark as the starless 
 sky, not one gleam of comfort presented itself to the outcast's 
 hope. But such state of mind was unnatural to the ardent boy, 
 and he sprang from it ; 
 
 " Like to a lark at break of day, iiprising 
 From sullen earth, to sing' at heaven's gate,"

 he soared from grovelling despondency into recollections of the 
 labour and love that had been expended on him. His harvest 
 might never be the crown at which he aimed ; but, better still, 
 the ambrosial food of affection and devoted attachment, that 
 filled him even to sweet satiety. 
 
 '• A litjht ! our beacon ! " cried Lord Barry. 
 
 A small gleam appeared on the opposite bank. It moved ; 
 then returned to its former place, and was stationary. They 
 watched it, till they became satisfied that it was the guide for 
 which they were waiting. The early matin service rung from 
 several convents, and came pealing faintly across the water. It 
 was the dead of night, and the gentlemen gladly exchanged their 
 inert a^ atch for the labour of contending with the tide and float- 
 ing ice, which impeded their way as they rowed across the 
 Thames to where the light was now fixed. 
 
 The drear bank of the Tower-moat rose abruptly from the 
 •water-side, and the waves lay murky dark beneath the arch of 
 the Traitor's Gate. The tide, which was setting in, carried them 
 above the point were the light was, to this spot. Their beacon 
 indeed had disappeared ; and, as they waited its return, they 
 floated idly on the river, merely giving now and then a few 
 strokes, to keep the wherry stationary. They did not perceive 
 that, while they thus curbed the tide, they had drifted into an 
 eddy which carried them fast down, till jamming them between 
 the wall of the Tower and a near pile, their boat lurched, partly 
 filled with water, and resisted every attempt they made to extri- 
 cate it. The clouds were getting thinner before the pale waning 
 moon ; but their fancied beacon-light had vanished. 
 
 Their situation was sufficiently dreary. The cold was piercing. 
 They had difficulty in keeping themselves out of the water that 
 lay at the bottom of the boat. Lord Barry was a soldier, accus- 
 tomed to hair- breadth escapes and dangerous attempts ; Richard 
 a bold youth, who thought that his best safety depended on his 
 own e:xertions. They were neither of them inclined to linger 
 tamely in their present situation. 
 
 " Before our limbs get numbed with this biting breeze, we 
 must use them to our own benefit. Your highness can swrm? " 
 
 " So say the streams of the Vega," replied Eichard : " but 
 the very remembrance of those sweet brooks makes me shudder 
 at the chilly bath this ice-nourished river affords. I will recon- 
 noitre the laud before I attempt the freezing wave." With 
 lithe, sinuous limbs he coiled about the pile, and continued to 
 raise himself to where a beam rested on the upright post, and 
 again was fixed in the turret, which spans and guards the en- 
 trance to the Tovrcr by water. He had hardly gained this place,

THE TOWEE. 173 
 
 and he felt little cold as with nervous fingers he kept fast in the 
 position he had attained, when a ray of light fell upon the water, 
 streaming from out a window of the turret. It was but for a 
 moment, and it disappeared ; but Richard's eyes had glanced 
 keenly on the illuminated spot. The transverse beam he had 
 attained was but little below the window ; it had been grated, 
 but two of the stancheons were broken. This, to our adventurer, 
 suspended between the unattainable sky and the icy wave, seemed 
 a place of refuge. Carefully and slowly, he with clinging knees 
 and hands contrived to get along the beam, to raise himself on 
 his feet on it, and then to clutch the broken iron bar, and hoist 
 himself into a chamber of the Tower of London. 
 
 The immediate physical dangers that beset our adventurers 
 were so great (the least horrific of which was spending the night 
 exposed to freezing blasts, which Barry already felt chilling his 
 very heart's blood), that they both forgot the dangerous nature 
 of the asylum they were seeking. The Irish noble had, as well 
 as darkness permitted, followed the movements of his young 
 companion ; the same ray which guided Richard to temporary 
 safety, had showed to Barry the mode of following him. He 
 made the attempt ; but, though stronger, he was not so agile as 
 his friend ; besides, the minutes which had elapsed during 
 Richard's exertions, had enfeebled by numbing the other's 
 powers ; he got nearly to the top of the pile — he felt his fingers 
 slip, and that he could hold on no longer. One desperate struggle 
 he made to cling closer ; his grasp seemed rather to relax, than 
 tighten, in the attempt ; and Richard, after a second, heard 
 with horror his heavy fall into the water. But Barry was more 
 at his ease in the yielding wave ; and the very intensity of the 
 cold, burning his skin, set his blood in motion ; the tide also 
 had arrived at its height during this interval, and had turned : 
 without great difficulty the noble cleared, after a few strokes, 
 the abrupt banks that fence the Tower, and landed on a quay 
 below. 
 
 Richard heard the waters splash from under his strokes. The 
 silence was so entire, that he thought he could distinguish the 
 change of sound when the swimmer emerged, and plainly heard 
 Lord Barry's shout, in his own native Irish, of thanksgiving 
 and good cheer. Por a moment, like lightning, it flashed into 
 his mind, the thought of the ominous refuge he had found ; and 
 he was tempted to leap into the water, and to rejoin his friend. 
 But by tliis time the alarm of some one having plunged into the 
 river had been spread by the sentinels. The court became 
 thronged ; some hastened to the wall, others loosened the boats 
 tethered beneath the gate, and issued in them from under the

 dark arch, over which Duke Eichard had found refuge. By 
 the glare of many torches, they discovered the wherry wedgecl 
 in, as has been described. The splash attested that some one 
 had fallen into the water : that some one should escape from 
 the fortress, was more readily present to their imaginations 
 than that any should enter. They called to each other, com- 
 municating their surmises and intentions : then one boat re- 
 mained in guard close at the gate, while the other rowed down 
 the stream. Their exertions must end in nothing, for Lord 
 Barry had had full time to insure his escape. 
 
 Eichard attended to all their motions : several of the men in 
 pursuit had issued from the lower chambers of the turret in 
 which he was : it was not thus cooped up that he chose to be 
 found ; all seemed still ; the only sounds came from the men in 
 the boat ; he descended the stairs ; he came out upon the court of 
 the Tower; the dark fortress frowned above, casting, in spite 
 of the dull moon, a shadow dark enough to h^de him. Steps 
 were heard approaching ; he turned under a dim archway ; he 
 ascended a narrow, steep staircase ; the steps still followed ; 
 hurriedly he opened a door, and entered a chamber ; the men, 
 whoever they might be, were unaware of his presence ; they 
 passed the door, turned down another gallery j the very echo 
 of their steps died away. 
 
 Did he recognize the spot where he then stood ? Well !— 
 far too well ! — with a sickening feeling, an irresistible impulse 
 to penetrate into the very heart of the horror that made his 
 pulses faint, he gazed on the walls around. Was he then alone 
 changed ? Had he sprung up into manhood, thought, expe- 
 rienced, suffered ; and had the material universe stood still the 
 while ? He saw before him a small chamber, enlightened by 
 one deep-set window, half blocked up by projecting buttresses 
 outside : there was the pallet-bed, the prie-Dieu, the little 
 crucifix ; his infant limbs had reposed there ; on that couch his 
 brother had died. 
 
 This was the Tower ! Ten years before he had escaped from its 
 gloomy walls ; and had he done this only to return again, when 
 maturer years gave him a bitterer feeling of the ills he must 
 endure ? He had visited England, guided by the traitor-spirit 
 of Clifford, it seemed ; for he had returned but to render him- 
 self a prisoner ; yet at first these thoughts were hardly so 
 painful as the memory of his childhood. The superstitious 
 fears of the Tower, which haunted poor Edward, had made it 
 an abode of terror for both: how often had they lain in that 
 bed, curdlmg each other's young blood with frightful tales ! 
 His brother had pined, and died. Now, true to the pious

THE TOWEE. 175 
 
 usages of the times, he knelt to say a paternoster for his soul ; 
 he said another for his own perilous state ; and then, havini^, 
 with entire faith committed himself to the protection of his 
 Father in Heaven, he rose with a cheered heart and sustained 
 couraj^e. 
 
 What was he to do ? He was in the Tower ; a fortress so 
 well guarded, that of the unhappy beinofs confined there for 
 life, none had ever made their escape; high walls, numerous 
 courts, and grated windows, opposed his egress. The clock 
 chimed one. It were as well to remain where he was, as to go 
 on. But it were better still to turn back ; quiet would soon be 
 restored ; he might attain the same room, the same window, and 
 leap thence into the waters below. He remembered wherefore 
 he had come ; the hazardous enterprise of Monina, and the 
 imprisonment of Stanley. Now that he had attained this 
 chamber, the whole Tower presented itself, as in a map, to his 
 memory : he knew where the rooms allotted to state prisoners 
 were situated : confident in his knowledge, his feelings under- 
 went an entire change ; instead of considering himself a prisoner 
 in the Tower, he felt lord of its labyrinths. Darkness was his 
 wand of office ; the ignorance of all that he was there, was his 
 guard ; and his knowledge of the place, better than the jailor's 
 key, might aid him to liberate the victims of his enemy. 
 
 In this temper of mind he rejoiced that he had been unable 
 to follow his first impulse in leaping from the window ; and he 
 resolved on making his way immediately to the part of the 
 fortress inhabited by the state prisoners. Blindfold, setting 
 out from the point where he was, he could have found his way ; 
 yet several images of barred and locked doors presented them- 
 selves to his recollection, as intervening between the spot where 
 he then was, and that which he desired to visit. He descended 
 again into the court — he skirted the edifice, keeping close to the 
 shadowy wall — he saw the door but a few paces distant, which 
 led to the prison-chambers. At dead of night it must be locked 
 and barred, guarded by a sentinel, quite inaccessible to him. 
 He paused — he saw no soldier near — he walked on a few steps 
 quickly ; the door was wide open — this looked like success — he 
 sprang up the steps; a man below cried, "Who goes there?" 
 adding, " Is it you, sir ? My fioht is puffed out ; I will bring 
 one anon." Above he heard another voice — there was no re- 
 treat — he went on, relying on some chance that might afibrd 
 him a refuge under cover of murky night from the twofold 
 danger that beset him. A man stood at the doorway of the 
 nearest chamber : it was not possible to pass him — as he hesi- 
 tated he heard the words, " Good rest visit your lordship-=^I

176 THE TOWEE. 
 
 grieve to liare disturbed you." Hichard retired a few steps — 
 the man closed, locked the door — "A light, ho! " he exclaimed, 
 and the prince feared to see the servitor ascend the stairs. The 
 moon, just beginning to show its clouded rays, threw a brief 
 ray upon the landing where Eichard stood, and he moved out 
 of the partial radiance ; the slight movement he made attracted 
 notice, which was announced by a challenge of " Who goes 
 there ? is it you, Fitzwilliam ? How is this ? the word, sir ! " 
 
 The duke knew that, among the numerous and various inha- 
 bitants of the Tower, many were personally unknown to each 
 other ; and that any stranger visitor was not intrusted with the 
 word — so he replied immediately, as his best safeguard : " I 
 was roused by the calling of the guard. I knew not that such, 
 reveilles were usual ; good night, sir." 
 
 Those pay little attention to the impression of their senses, 
 who are not aware that family i:esemblance develops itself in 
 nothing so much as the voice ; and that it is difficult in the dark 
 to distinguish relatives. In confirmation of this I heard a 
 sagacious observer remark, and have proved the observation 
 true, that the formation of the jaw, and setting of the teeth is 
 peculiar, and the same in families. But this is foreign — enough 
 that, caught by the voice, hardly able to distinguish the obscure 
 outline of the speaker in the almost blackness of night — the 
 man replied, '*' I crave pardon, my good lord, you forget your- 
 self; this way is your chamber. \Vhat, ho ! a light ! " 
 
 "It needs not," said the prince; "the glare would ofiend 
 mine eyes — I shall find the door." 
 
 " Permit me," said the other, going forward, " I will wait on 
 your lordship so far. I wonder not you were roused ; there 
 was an alarm at the river postern, and the whole guard roused. 
 Sir John thought it might concern poor Sir William ; and I 
 was fain to see all right with him. It irked me truly to break 
 in on his repose ; the last he may ever have." 
 
 They approached a door ; the man's hand was on the lock — 
 Richard's heart beat so loud and fast, that it seemed to him that 
 that alone must be perceived and excite suspicion — if the door 
 were fastened on the inside he were lost ; but the man was in 
 no hurry to try — he talked on : — 
 
 " The lieutenant was the more suspicious, because he gave 
 credit and easy entrance to his pretended stripling son, wlio 
 craved for it even with tears : yet when they met, we all 
 thought that the Lord Chamberlain did not greet him as a 
 parent would a child at such a time ; the truth, indeed, we saw 
 with half an eye, be she his daughter, or his light of love ; yet 
 not the last, methinks, for she seemed right glad to bo accom-

 modafced for the night in a separate chamber— slie is a mere 
 girl beside, and in spite of her unmeet garb, modest withal." 
 
 " When goes she ? With the dawn ? " Richard hazarded 
 these questions, for his silence might be more suspected tlian 
 his speech ; and the information he sought, imported to him. 
 
 "Nay, she will stay to the end for me," said the man: " Sir 
 William was a kind gentleman, as I can testify, in his prosperity ; 
 and it is little to let him have the comfort of this poor child's 
 company for a day longer : he dies on the morrow." 
 
 " Could 1 see this fair one ? " 
 
 *' By my troth, fair she is not, though lovely to look on, but 
 somewhat burnt, as if her mother had been a dweller in the 
 south. If you visit and take leave of Sir Stanley to-morrow, 
 you may chance to behold her : but I detain you, my Lord ; a 
 good night, rather, a good morning to your lordship." 
 
 He unclosed the door; all was dark within, save that the 
 chamber opened into another at the further end, in which evi- 
 dently a lamp was burning. Kind thanks and a benison passed ; 
 Kichard stepped within the apartment, and the door shut on him. 
 
 What coufd this mean ? ' G-lad, confused, yet slill fearful, the 
 prince was almost deprived of the power of motion. Kecoveriug 
 himself with a strong effort, he passed on to the inner chamber : 
 it was a bedroom, tapestried, strewed thick with rushes, a silver 
 lamp suspended by a silver chain to the grim claws of a gilt 
 eagle, which was fixed in the ceiling, gave token of rank, as well 
 as the rich damask of the bed-furniture and the curious carving 
 of the couch and seats; the articles of dress also strewed about 
 belonged to the noble born : strange, as yet Eichard had not 
 conjectured for whom he had been mistaken ! He drew near the 
 bed, and gazed fixedly on its occupier. The short, clustering, 
 auburn curls were tinged with grey, yet the sleeper was young, 
 though made untimely old by suffering ; his cheeks were wasted 
 and fallen in ; the blue veins on liis brow were conspicuous, lift- 
 ing the clear skin which clung almost to the bones ; he was as 
 pale as marble, and the heavy eyelids were partly raised even in 
 sleep by the large blue ball that showed itself beneath ; one hand 
 lay on the coverlid, thin to emaciation. What manner of victim 
 ■was this to Henry's tyranny ? nay, the enigma was easily solved : 
 it must be the earl of Warwick. " And such, but for my cousin 
 Lincoln, would have been my fate," thought Eichard. He 
 remembered his childhood's imprisonment ; he thought of the 
 loua- days and nights of confinement, the utter hopelessness, the 
 freezing despair, blighting the budding hopes of youth, the throes 
 of intolerable, struggling agony, which had reduced poor War- 
 wick to this shadow of humanity ; he felt a choking sensation in

 his throat as he bent over him ; large drops gathered in his eyes ; 
 they fell, ere he was aware, on the sleeper's wan check. 
 
 Warwick turned uneasily, opened his eyes, and half-started 
 up : " Whom have we here ?" he cried : " why am I disturbed ?" 
 
 "Your pardon, fair gentleman," Eichard began 
 
 **My pardon!" repeated Warwick, bitterly; "were that 
 needed, you were not here. What means this intrusion — tell 
 rae, and be gone ?" 
 
 "I am not what you take me for, cousin Edward," said the 
 prince. 
 
 'Now, indeed, did Warwick start ; shading his eyes from the 
 lamp, he gazed earnestly on the speaker, murmuring, " That 
 voice, that name — it cannot be ! In the name of sweet charity 
 speak again ; tell me what this means, and if you are — why this 
 visit, why that garb ? " 
 
 " My dear lord of Warwick," said the prince, '' dismiss this 
 inquietude, and if you will listen with patience to the story of an 
 ■unhappy kinsman, you shall know all. I am Eichard of York ; 
 those whose blood is akin to yours as well as mine, have ycleped 
 me the White Eose of England." 
 
 - The earl of Warwick had heard of the Pretender set up by his 
 aunt, the duchess of Burgundy ; he had often pondered over the 
 likelihood of his really being his cousin, and the alteration it 
 would occasion in his fortunes, if he were to succeed. Shut out 
 from the world, as he had been so long, the victim of mere 
 despair, he could not even imagine that good could betide to any 
 one, save to the oppressor of his race ; to see Perkin, for so he 
 had been taught to call him, within the walls of the ill-fated 
 Tower, appeared to disclose at once his defeat. Even when the 
 duke rapidly and briefly narrated the accidents that had brought 
 him thither, and his strange position. Prince Edward believed 
 only that he had been decoyed into the trap, which had closed on 
 him for ever. 
 
 Still Eichard talked on ; his ardour, liis confidence in his own 
 measures, his vivacious anxiety already to put them into practice, 
 his utter fearlessness, were not lost upon one who had been dead 
 to outward impressions, not from want of sensibility, but from 
 the annihilation of hope. Some of his cousin's spirit overflowed 
 into Warwick's heart ; and, in conclusion, he assented to all he 
 said, promising to do whatever was required of him, though after 
 ten years of lone imprisonment he almost shrunk from emerging 
 from his hstless state.

 A mile hence. 
 
 Two KoBLE Kinsmen. 
 
 MoENiXG, cold and wintry, dawned upon the gloomy cliambers 
 of the Tower. York became eager to put in execution some 
 plan of escape in wliich Warwick should share ; but Warwick 
 was full of timidity and fear. His prison was a frightful den ; 
 yet all without was a wide, pathless, tiger-infested jungle. He 
 besought his cousin to regard his own safety only. Eichard 
 refused ; yet the more he meditated, the more did obstacles 
 crowd upon him. After the lapse of an hour, Warwick was 
 called upon to attend early mass, as usual, in the chapel of the 
 fortress. Here hs saw Stanley and the disguised shrinking 
 Monina ; and, the service ended, attended them to the prison- 
 chamber of the chamberlain, relating as he went, in quick low 
 whispers, the history of the preceding night. Both his hearers 
 grew pale: one feared for her friend, the other for himself; 
 though on that score all cause of dread was well ni^h at an end. 
 All three entered Stanley's cell, and found there Prince Eichard 
 himself, whose active mind had led him to watch his opportunity 
 to pass hither unseen from Warwick's apartment. 
 
 The young earl of March, arming for the battle of jN'orthamp- 
 ton, looked not so young, so blooming, and so frankly erect, as 
 his uncrowned son. Stanley saw at once who was before him, 
 and, never forgetting the courtier, addressed his prince with a 
 subject's respect. York was struck by the placid, though some- 
 what worldly physiognomy of the man, devoted to die, at the age 
 when human beings are most apt to cling to life ; when, having 
 weathered the storms and passions of youth, they desire to repose 
 awhile on the sun-enlightened earth, before they enter the 
 gloomy gates of the tomb. 
 
 The prince spoke eagerly of escape — of safety — of life : War-

 wick, even timid Warwick, urged an attempt at flight ; while 
 Monina kissed her aged friend's hand, and turned her sweet eyes 
 on him, saying : " You will listen to him, though you were deaf 
 to me." 
 
 Stanley alone was unmoved — " A thousand heartfelt, useless 
 thanks, my dear and honoured Lord, your poor servant renders ; 
 and even when prayer for himself is most needed, earnestly he 
 prays that harm to you arise not from your unexampled gene- 
 rosity. I cannot fly ; I do believe that I would not, if I could : 
 and I will spare myself the disgrace of further endangering you, 
 and of being seized myself in the coward's act. Ask me not, 
 with your beseeching eyes, my gentle, venturous child, for it 
 must not be. I die to-morrow ; and this fate you would have 
 me avoid. Whither would you drag me from the block ? To 
 poverty ? to an unhonoured old age ? a traitor's reputation, and 
 miserable dependence ? I am a sinful man ; but I trust in God's 
 mercy, and he holds out better hopes after the brief spasm of 
 death, than you after the torture of difficult escape." 
 
 More he would have said ; but they were interrupted. They 
 had not been aware of any one's approach ; and suddenly Sir 
 John Digby, lieutenant of the Tower, entered. He was aghast 
 to see one more than he expected — one whose demeanour spoke 
 nobility. Silence followed his entrance ; nor did words readily 
 present themselves to the blunt soldier. At length, addressing 
 the cause of this wonder, he, in an ironical tone of voice, asked, 
 " May I, lieutenant of this fortress, delegated by his majesty to 
 its keeping, be permitted to ask, fair sir, the name, station, and 
 designs of my unbidden guest ? " 
 
 " My answer to your two first questions," replied York, 
 "would little satisfy you. My design was to facilitate the 
 escape of this virtuous and unhappy gentleman." 
 
 *' The king is infinitely your debtor ; and I shall prove unman- 
 nered in marring your intent." 
 
 " You do not mar it. Sir John," said the prince. " My Lord 
 Chamberlain is a true man, and would rather lay his head on 
 the block, at his liege's bidding, than carry it in security at the 
 prayer of any other. Sir William has refused to fly ; and, my 
 mission ended, I was about to take my leave." 
 
 " Do so, y ■ ang man ; take leave — an eternal one — of Sir 
 William, and follow me. My lord of Warwick, this is an 
 unmeet scene for you to be present at. This holy man comes 
 to bestow the last words of pious comfort my noble prisoner can 
 receive in this world : please your lordship to leave them together 
 uninterrupted. I am sorry," continued the lieutenant, address- 
 ing Monina, " to retract the permission I gave you yesterday ;

 but this strange incident must be my excuse. Say a last 
 farewell to liim you have named your father." 
 
 Monina dreaded too much the fate that might befall her 
 friend to entreat for any change in this decree. Soon poor Sir 
 William found himself separated from the busy scene of life, 
 shut up with the chaplain. He was bid to remember and 
 repent, ^nd to prepare to die. A dark veil fell before the vista 
 of coming years, which was apparent to the eyes of his late 
 companions. He saw in the present hour — one only, almost 
 superfluous, added to the closing account. They beheld in it 
 the arbiter of their undivineil destinies. 
 
 It is an awful emotion ^Uen we feel that the "very shoal 
 of time " on which we stand is freighted with the good and ill 
 of futurity — that the instant birth of tlie hour inherits our 
 entire fortunes. Yet Eichard was proof against this rough 
 testimony of our powerless mortalit3^ The ill had not yet 
 arrived with which he did not believe he could cope ; and more 
 — now he was bent upon endeavouring to save Stanley ; for his 
 own fate, though about to expose it to the most unquestioned 
 shape of peril, he had no fears. 
 
 Sir John Digby, followed by his new pri >oners, paced back to his 
 own chamber, and then addressed his uninvited guest. " Fair 
 gentleman," he said, " again I crave to be informed of your 
 name and degree, that his majesty may be duly made acquainted 
 on whom to bestow his thanks. Your speech and appearance 
 are English ? " 
 
 "Whoever I may be," replied York, "I will reveal nothing 
 except to your king. If he is willing to listen to disclosures 
 nearly touching his throne and safety, I will rouse him by a 
 tale to shake sleep from one who has steeped his eyes in poppy- 
 juice. To no other will I vouchsafe a word." 
 
 Monina listened in terror. She would have given her life to 
 beseech her friend to retract that foolish word : but it was too 
 late ; while his questioner, startled by his unforeseen reply, 
 said, " You make a bold demand. Think you that his grace is 
 of such common use, that it is an easy matter to attain his 
 presence ? " *^ 
 
 " I have said it, Sir John," answered York. " Your liege may 
 hereafter visit with poor thanks the denial you give me." 
 
 The lieutenant fixed his eyes on him : his youth and dignity 
 impressed him favourably ; but he hesitated, confused by doubts 
 of who and what he might be. At last he said, " His majesty 
 is at present at his palace of Shene, ten miles hence. 
 
 " The less reason, Sir Lieutenant," replied Richard, " that 
 you should dally in the execution of your duty. The life of

182 THE RESCUE. 
 
 your prisoner, the fortunes of your kiug, depend upon this 
 interview." 
 
 This was a riddle difficult for Sir John to solve ; and he was 
 about to order his enigmatical visitant to the guard-room, while 
 he should consult upon the fittinfj conduct to pursue ; when 
 a beating at the gates, the letting down of the drawbridge, and 
 the clatter of hoofs announced fresh arrivals at the fortress. 
 
 The attention of every one was suspended, till, the usher 
 announcing the excellent prince, the earl of Desmond, that noble, 
 attended by followers, almost with regal pomp, entered. He 
 cast his penetrating glance around, and then unbonnetting to the 
 duke, he said respectfully, " Your highness will believe that as 
 soon as I heard of the position into which, pardon me, your 
 generous rashness has betrayed you, I hastened hither to vouch 
 for you, and deliver you from it." 
 
 To such a speech, so unexpected, so portentous, what answer ? 
 [Richard felt inclined to laugh, as he heard himself spoken to, in 
 terms which seemed to say that the discovery of who he really 
 was, would occasion his release ; but he quickly discerned a 
 hidden meaning beneatli this incomprehensible language, and he 
 contented himself with graciously thanking the earl for his inter- 
 ference, while this noble turned to address the wondering Sir 
 John. 
 
 " Sir Lieutenant," said he, *' I have a strange story to tell, 
 fitter for his majesty's ears than those of a subject ; but his grace 
 is absent, and it were not well that this noble gentleman should 
 be kept in durance while messengers go to and fro. [Rather 
 dismiss your followers, and I will confide a weighty secret to 
 you, and bring such arguments as will induce you to intrust the 
 high-born youth to my care and escort." 
 
 Digby was not much of a statesman ; he had a simple heart, 
 and considerable veneration for rank. He knew that the earl of 
 Desmond had been well received at court, and complied with his 
 desire. The noble then began a long explanation of parties and 
 tumults in Scotland ; of the frightful death of James the Third ; 
 the accession of James the Fourth ; the discontent of several 
 chief nobles, who wished to set up th^ younger brother of the 
 new king in opposition to him. " Your highness," continued 
 Desmond, addressing Richard, " will pardon me for thus intro- 
 ducing your name — this, Sir Lieutenant, is the duke of Eosse, who 
 has come, and not vainly, to seek the assistance of our liege." 
 
 Sir John bowed low and looked puzzled, while Desmond con- 
 tinued to speak of disguise and secresy, of friendship for Stanley, 
 and of the rash design of Lord Barry of Buttevant and tlie young 
 duke to liberate him, chiefly under the idea that thus they should

 Ijesfc serve Kinp^ Henry, \vlio must in liis lieart be loth to liave 
 liis zealous friend put to death throujj[h the falsehood of faction. 
 " And now, gentle sir," he continued, " be guided by me ; the 
 king loves peace ; he loves state privacy ; the very presence of 
 the duke in this country is a mystery ; you vrill do agreeable 
 service by hushing up this youthful frolic. Permit his highness 
 to accompany me ; I will make fitting report to his majesty, who 
 will be grateful withal." 
 
 Tliere was a kind of confused tallying in the story ; for 
 Richard's mysterious words were at no discord with Desmond's 
 explanations ; and his excessively youthful and perfectly noble 
 appearance were further corroboration. Digby liked not the 
 rosponsibility of keeping him: he spoke of sending for the bishop 
 of Durham. Desmond exclaimed, " A soldier have recourse to a 
 priest — tliis England is a strange country ! Do as you will ; 
 only until the thumber of missals arrive, this is no place of 
 entertainment fur the prince. We will receive you and your 
 clericus at Walbrook ; and I will entertain the royal gentleman 
 till you come." 
 
 Digby still looked blank and uncertain. Hichard, who had 
 remained silent, now spoke : " Farewell, good sir : in truth, I 
 need your excuse for ^ny impertinent visit ; but here it ends. 
 When I travel to Scotland, I will report the favour I met at 
 your hands," 
 
 This sufficed. Sir John sullenly yielded : with a mixture of 
 fear and deference, he attended his visitors to the court ; they 
 crossed the drawbridge ; and ere the Tower-gates closed behind 
 them, they heard the lieutenant order out a guard and his own 
 horse, that without loss of time he might communicate with the 
 bi.-^hop. 
 
 The duke and his preserver rode gently enough down Tower 
 Hill : scarce had they reached the foot, before the earl gave a 
 sudden command to his followers, who turned one way, as he, 
 York, and Monina, who had left the Tower at the same time, 
 and was mounted on one of Desmond's attendant's horses, went 
 another. " Aio galoppe, dear my lord!" cried the earl, ''we 
 have but a short hour's grace — this way — still the river to our 
 left." 
 
 They galloped along with loosened reins. Arriving at the 
 Vale of Holboru, they followed the upward course of the Fleet, 
 so as to reach the open country ; and many a wild field they 
 crossed, and briary lane they threaded — the country was flat, 
 marshy, wild ; skirted in various directions by brown wintry 
 -\^■oods, rarely interspersed by hamlets. The river was their 
 only guide ; they followed its course for several miles, till they

 reached the shelter of Caen Wood. ''Thank St. Patrick for 
 this cover ! " cried the Irish chieftain ; " may my cousin Barry 
 find no let nor hindrance — yon troubled stream will guide him 
 ■well. We have done a daring deed : for me, I have not ridden 
 so far, since my father, God sain him ! died — I am well nigh 
 Jiors de combat." 
 
 The prince assisted both his companions to dismount. 
 Lord Desmond's tale was soon told, of how Lord Barry had 
 souglit him and suggested this mode of effecting York's escape. 
 " With the help of your Moorish friend," said the earl, "no ill 
 wind betide me — I shall be in Munster before the riddle be half 
 told ; that is, if ever we reach the vessel. By my faith ! I would 
 rather be knee-deep in a bog in Thomond, than dry-shod where 
 I am ! " 
 
 As day advanced, the situation of the fugitives became still 
 more disquieting. All was tranquil in the leafless wood ; but, in 
 spite of the sun, it was very cold. Besides, they were in an 
 unknown spot, without guide ; their sole hope being, that each 
 passing minute would bring Lord Barry to their assistance. 
 Earl Maurice was thoroughly disabled ; he grumbled at first, 
 and at last, weai'ied out, lay on the cold ground, and fell into 
 a slumber. Monina, serious, timid, and yet, in spite of herself, 
 happy in her friend's safety, and in her own being near him, 
 was silent ; while Richard, to escape from his own thoughts, 
 talked to her. When, for a moment, his conversation languished, 
 his eyes were fondly fixed upon her downcast face, and a strife 
 of sentiment, of ardent, long-restrained love, and a tortuous, but 
 severe resolve to protect her, even from himself, battled in his 
 heart ; so that, in all-engrossing love, every sense of danger 
 was lost. 
 
 Desmond at last roused himself : *' The shadows grow long ; 
 herbage there is little for our horses, pasture for ourselves there 
 is none — if we stay, we starve ; if we stir, we " 
 
 He was interrupted ; strange voices came upon the wind ; then 
 the cracking of boughs, and the sound of steps. Through the vista 
 of bare trees the intruders at length appeared, in strange array. 
 There was a band of ill-attired, ruffian-looking men, followed by 
 women and children ; their swart visages, their picturesque, but 
 scant and ragged garb, their black hair, and dark flashing eyes, 
 were not English. Some were on foot, some on asses, some in 
 a cart drawn by two rough ill-assorted colts — their very language 
 was foreign. Eichard and Monina recognized a horde of Gitani, 
 Bohemians, or Gipsies ; while Desmond looked in wonder on 
 something almost wilder than the Irish kern.

THE EESCPE. 185 
 
 The savao;e wanderers were surprised to perceive tlie previous 
 guests tlie barren woods had received — they paused and looked 
 round in some fear ; for the noble appearance of the gentlemen 
 made them imao^ine that they must be accompanied by numerous 
 attendants. York's quick wit suggested to him in a moment of 
 what good use such humble friends might be. He addressed 
 them ; told them that they were travellers who had lost their 
 way, "And so we have encroached on your rightful domain; 
 but, like courteous hosts, I beseech you, gentlemen, welcome us 
 to your greenwood palace, and make happy as you will grateful 
 guests of us." 
 
 Thus invited, the whole horde gathered round— the women, 
 fancying all three of an opposite sex, were forward with their 
 prophetic art. 
 
 " My fortune," cries Desmond, " shall not be told before 
 supper ; it is an ill one, by the rood ! at this hour. I have fasted 
 since yesternight." 
 
 Preparations were speedily made for a repast, while Eichard, 
 alive to his situation, looked around for the most fitting object to 
 address ; whose charity and aid he could hope to solicit with the 
 greatest success. One laughing-eyed girl glanced at him with 
 peculiar favour ; but near her stood and scowled a tall handsome 
 countryman of her own. York turned to another, fairer, who 
 sat retired apart ; she looked more gentle and even refined than 
 the rest. He addressed her in courtly phrase, and her reply, 
 though ready, was modest. The acquaintance was a little in pro- 
 gress, when one of the oldest dmong the sibyls, with white hair, 
 and a face of wrinkled parchment, hobbled up, muttering, "Ay, 
 ay, the fairest flower is aye the dearest to pluck ; any of those 
 gaudy weeds might serve his turn ; but no, my young master 
 must needs handle the daintiest bloom of the garden." Notwith- 
 standing this interruption, Eichard still stood his ground, bandy- 
 ing pretty speeches with one not the less pleased, because, 
 strictly guarded by her duenna, she was unaccustomed to the 
 language of flattery. 
 
 '• Hast never a word for me, fair sir," said the crone, at last ; 
 *' no comparison of star and gems for one, who in her day has 
 flaunted with sillc-clad dames — whose lips have been pressed 
 even by a king ? " 
 
 His father's reputation for gallantry, thus alluded to, brought 
 the blood into York's cheeks ; forgetful of what import his 
 words bore, he replied lastly, " Sleep King Edward's faults with 
 him, mother ; it is neither wise nor well to speak irreverently 
 of those gone to their doom — may God assoilzie him ! " .

 " What voice is that?" cried the old woman ; *' if I boast, 
 Heaven foi-t^ive me, of his grace's slight favour, your mother 
 may take shame " 
 
 " Your words are naught," cried York, interrupting her, "my 
 mother's is a sacred name — yet, tell me in very truth, and give 
 me some sign that, indeed, you knew my father." 
 
 The word passed his lips before he was aware, but being 
 spoken, he felt that it were best not to recede. Seizing the old 
 woman's shrivelled hand, he said, "Look — use thy art — read my 
 palm : read rather my features, and learn indeed who I am : I 
 am in danger ; you may betray, or you may save me : choose 
 which you will — I am the duke of York." 
 
 An exclamation checked, a look of boundless surprise changed 
 into a cautious glance around, attested the gipsy's wish to serve 
 the venturous youth. "Eash boy," she answered, in a low 
 voice, '* what idle, or what mortal words are these ! How art 
 thou here ? "With what hope — what aid ? " 
 
 *' Frankly, none but what I derive from your bounty. I have 
 escaped worse peril, so do not fear but tliat God will protect me, 
 and even turn to profit my parent's sin, if his kiss purchase his 
 son's life." 
 
 "Young sir," said the gipsy, with great seriousness, "the 
 flower of love is gay — its fruit too often bitter. So does she 
 know on whose account I wickedly and shamelessly did the foul 
 fiend's bidding, and ruined a sinless soul to gratify the pleasure- 
 loving king. But thou hast paid the penalty : thou and thine, 
 who have been called by the ill-word, thrust from thy place by 
 thy crook-back uncle ; and now art nearer a dungeon than a 
 throne through thy father's fault. I will serve and save thee j 
 tell me quickly, who are thy companions — whither thou wouldst 
 go — that I may judge the best to be done." 
 
 It is to be observed, that at the very beginning of this colloquy, 
 the young girl, whom York had first addressed, had stolen away. 
 Now he replied by mentioning the lameness of his elder friend, 
 and his resolve not to be divided from the other. He spoke of 
 the Adalid, and of his further wish to be awhile concealed in 
 England. The old woman continued silent, wrapped in thought. 
 At length she raised her head — " It can be done, and it shall," 
 she said, half to herself. " Come now, they are serving our 
 homely fare. You, who are young, and ill-apt for penance, 
 must eat before you go." 
 
 The savoury steams of the well-filled and rustic marmife, 
 gave force to her words, and to Eichard's appetite. The repast 
 was plentiful and gay, and even too long. Evening was far 
 advanced, the fire grew light in the dusk, and threw its fitful

 rays upon tlio strano-e and inconcijruous fcasterf!. Monina liad 
 cosvered close to llieliard ; the cup vieut round; scarcely did 
 she put it to her lips ; a rude companion of the crew made some 
 ron^h jest on her sobriety. Eichard's face lighted up with 
 anger : his watchful old friend stepped forward, in her own jargon 
 she made some communication to Jier associates, which caused a 
 universal pause, and then a stir : it was evident some movement 
 was intended. She meanwhile drew the three fugitives aside : 
 "In a few minutes," she said, "we shall all be on our way 
 hence ; listen how I would provide for your safeties." She then 
 proposed that Desmond should assume the disguise of one of the 
 horde, and so be conveyed in safety to the banks of the Thames, 
 and on board the Adalid. She promised herself to conduct the 
 prince and his young friend to a secure refuge. The earl, 
 accustomed to find fidelity and rags near mates, readily acceded 
 to this proposal. In the solitary unknown spot to which, chance 
 had directed ihem, environed by every danger, no step was 
 more perilous than the remaining where they were. York and 
 Monina were familiar with the reports of the gipsy character 
 ■ — its savage honour and untractable constancy. The season 
 was such, though the day had been unusally sunny and warm, 
 as to make a night in the open air no agreeable anticipation ; 
 and Eichard had a thousand fears on his lovely friend's account. 
 They all readily acceded to the old woman's plan. Desmond 
 was quickly disguised, his visage stained deep brown, his whole 
 person transformed ; he was placed in the caravan, and the 
 horde was speedily in movement ; the sound of their departing 
 steps died away. They had left a rude cart, to which York's 
 horse, a strong hack, was harnessed. The sibvl undertook to 
 guide it. Ivichard and Monina ascended the jumbling fabric. 
 Soon they were on their journey, none but their conductress 
 knew in what direction ; but they submitted to her, and through 
 copse and over field they wound their darkling ■^ ay.

 CHAPTEE XXVI. 
 
 THE EAEL OF SUEEEY. 
 
 So love did vanish with my state. 
 Which now my soul repents too late; 
 Then, maids and wives, in time amend, 
 For love and beauty will have end. 
 
 Ballad of Jane Shore. 
 
 Oh, it grieves my soul » 
 That I must draw this metal from my side 
 To be a widow maker ! 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 Seated in tlie rude gipsy-cart, guided, protected, by the 
 uncouth being into whose hands he had so strangely fallen, 
 Hichard, for the first time, felt the degradation and low fortune 
 to which his aspirations, at variance with his means, made him 
 liable. With a strong effort he dismissed these painful ideas, 
 and fixed his contemplation on mightier objects, which gilded 
 his mean estate, or were rather the " gold o'erdusted" by such 
 extraneous poverty. To rise from this lowliness to a throne 
 were an emprise worthy his ambition. Was he not a few hours 
 ago a prisoner in the terror-striking tower ? And now he was 
 free — free in his England; which, when the battle-day was 
 come and past, would claim him for her own. A few words 
 from Monina interrupted the silence : she sat at his feet, and 
 they conversed in whispers in Spanish. Night had gathered 
 round them ; Monina, in all the innocence of her pure heart was 
 supremely happy : to be near her friend in his disasters, united 
 to him in his peril, was a more rapturous destiny to her than 
 the world's best pomp, and he absent. No busy conscience, no 
 untoward thought disturbed in her soul the calm of perfect 
 bliss. She grew weary at last ; her head sank on Richard's 
 knee, and, overworn with watching, she fell into a deep sleep. 
 Hichard heard her regular breathing ; once or twice his fingers 
 played among her dishevelled ringlets, while his heart whispered 
 to him what a wondrous creation woman was — weak, frail, 
 complaining when she suffers for herself j heroic fortitude and

 untired self-devotion are hers, when she sacrifices herself for him 
 she loves. 
 
 The cart moved on, Eichard saw not whither ; they almost 
 stuck in some flat, low fields, and at last arrived at a solitary, 
 miserable hut. Monina awoke, when they stopped, and the gipsy 
 told them that this wretched dwelling was to be their asylum : 
 the apartment they entered was poor beyond meanness — a bed 
 of straw piled in one corner, a rude bench, formed the furniture ; 
 the walls were ragged and weather-stained, and the outer crumb- 
 ling rafters were visible through the broken ceiling : there 
 appeared to be neither food nor fire. The inhabitant of the 
 hovel alone was there, — a white-looking, emaciated female ; yet 
 with a look of such sweetness and patience, that she aeemed the 
 very enshrinement of Christian resignation, the type of sorrow 
 and sufiering, married to meek obedience to the supreme will. 
 She had roused herself from slumber at the voice of the gipsy, 
 and gathered her scant garments around her — scant and poor 
 they were ; her coarse woollen dress was tied by a girdle of rope 
 round her slender waist ; her head was wrapped in a kerchief j her 
 feet were bare. 
 
 " Jane," said the old woman, "yon will not refuse the shelter 
 of your roof to these poor wanderers ? " 
 
 Such an address seemed strange, for the rich attire of her 
 guests ill-accorded with her poverty-stricken home ; but she 
 turned with a smile — she spoke — and then a throb of agony 
 seemed to convulse her frame — her head swam ; Eichard rushed 
 forward to prevent her falling, but she shrunk from him, and 
 leaned on the old woman, who said with a look of triumph, " I 
 knew how it would be ; it is vain to hide a bright light behind a 
 veil of gauze ! Yes, Jane, this is his son ; and you may save 
 him from danger and death." 
 
 Jane Shore, the once lovely mistress of King Edward, now 
 the miserable outcast of the world's scorn, heard these words, 
 as if they had been spoken to her in a dream. After the death 
 of her royal lover, she had obeyed ihe impulse that made her 
 cling to the soft luxuries of life, and yielded to solicitations 
 which tended to guard her from the sharp visitation of the 
 world. She had become the mistress of the marquess of Dorset ; 
 but sorrow and penury were destined to pursue her in their 
 worst shape — and wherefore ? She had been good and humane ; 
 and in spite of her error, even the sternest moralist might have 
 pitied her. But she was all woman, — fearful of repulse, dreading 
 insult ; more willing to lie down and die, than, fallen and naiser- 
 able, to solicit uncertain relief: squalid poverty, famine, and 
 lonely suffering, were hers j yet in all she preserved an unalter-

 able sweetness of dispcsition, wliicli painted her wan face with, 
 its own soft colouring. 
 
 The old woman went forth to seek for food, and the two friends 
 were left for several hours alone with Jane. She gazed affec- 
 tionately on the youthful duke ; she looked more timidly on 
 Monina, whose sex could not be said to be disguised by her 
 page's dress : the fallen woman fears women, their self-sufficient 
 virtues and cold reprobation ; yet the sensibility of Monina's 
 countenance, and the soft expression of her eyes, so all-powerful 
 in their sweetness, could not be mistaken ; and her first shrinking 
 from censure was exchanged for even a more painful feeling. 
 They were a lovely pair, these lone guests of poverty ; innocence 
 sat on the brow of each, yet love beamed in their aspect : — love ! 
 the two-edged sword, the flower-strewn poison, the dread cause 
 of every misery ! More than famine and sickness Jane feared 
 love ; for with it in her mind were linked shame and guilt, and 
 the world's unkindness, hard to bear to one, whose heart was 
 " open as day to melting charity ; " and she feared that she saw 
 in this sweet girl a bright reflex of her early days. Oh, might 
 the blotted mirror ne'er pourtray a change like hers ! "I am a 
 living lesson of the woes of love," thought poor Jane ; " may 
 this chance-visit to my hut, which saves young Richard's life, 
 insure her innocence ! " Thus impelled, she spoke : she spoke 
 of the danger of their solitary companionship ; she adjured York 
 to fl}"- the delusive charm — for love's own sake he ought to fly ; 
 for if he made her his victim, afl"ection would be married to hate 
 ■ — _]oy to woe — her he prized to a skeleton, more grim than death. 
 Kichard strove to interrupt her, but she misunderstood his 
 meaning ; while Monina, somewhat bewildered, fancied that she 
 only alluded to the dangers she incurred in his cause, and with 
 her own beaming look cried, *' Oh, mother, is it not better to 
 suffer for one so noble, than to live in the cold security of 
 prosperity ? " 
 
 " No, no," said Jane, " Oh, does my miserable fate cry aloud, 
 no ! Edward, his father, was bright as he. Libertine he was 
 called — I know not if truly ; but sincere was the aflection he 
 bore to me. He never changed or faltered in the faith he pro- 
 mised, when he led me from the dull abode of connubial strife 
 to the bright home of love. Hiches and the world's pleasures 
 were the least of his gifts, for he gave me himself and happiness. 
 Behold me now : tM-elve long 3'ears have passed, and I waste 
 and decay ; the wedded wife of shame ; famine, sorrow, and re- 
 morse, my sole companions." 
 
 This language was too plain. The blood rushed into Monina's 
 face. *' Oh, love him not," continued the hapless penitent ; " fly

THE EAEL OF SUEEEY. 191 
 
 his love, because he is beautiful, good, noble, worthy — fly from 
 him, and thus preserve him yours for ever." 
 
 Monina quickly recovered herself; she interrupted her im- 
 prudent monitress, and calmly assured her that her admonition, 
 thougli unnecessary, should not prove vain ; and then both she 
 and York exerted themselves to engage Jane's attention on 
 topics relative to his cause, his hopes, his partizans, thus exciting 
 her curiosity and interest. 
 
 Richard passed the whole of the following day in this abode 
 
 ' of penury and desolation. That day, indeed, was big with dire 
 event. The morning rose upon Stanley's death. In Jane's hut 
 
 ' the hollow bell was heard that tolled the fatal hour. The ear is 
 sometimes the parent of a livelier sense than any other of the 
 
 ■ soul's apprehensive portals. In Italy, for three days in Passion 
 week, the sound of every bell and of every clock is suspended. 
 On the noon of the day when the mystery of the Eesurrection is 
 solemnized, they all burst forth in one glad peel. Every Catho- 
 lic kneels in prayer, and even the unimaginative Pretestant feels 
 the influence of a religion which speaks so audibl}'. And, in 
 this more sombre land, the sad bell that tolls for death strikes 
 more melancholy to the heart than the plumed hearse or any 
 other pageantry of woe. In silence and fear the fugitives heard 
 the funereal knell sweep across the desolate fields, telling them 
 that at that moment Stanley died. 
 
 Women nurse grief — dwell with it. Like poor Constance, 
 they dress their past joys in mourning raiment, and so abide 
 with them. But the masculine spirit struggles with sufiering. 
 How gladly, that very evening, did the duke hail Prion's arrival, 
 who, in the garb of a saintly pardoner, came to lead him from 
 Jane's dim abode. In spite of his remonstrances, Monina re- 
 fused to accompany him : she should endanger him, she said ; 
 besides that, his occupation would be to rouse a martial spirit 
 among the Yorkists — hers to seek the Adalid and her dear 
 father's protection. 
 
 Prion procured a safe asylum for the prince : and here, no 
 longer pressed by the sense of immediate danger, his head was rife 
 with projects, his spirit burning to show himself first to the York- 
 ists, in a manner worthy of his pretensions. The choice was 
 hazardous and difficult : but it so happened that it was notified 
 that in a few weeks Lord Surrey's eldest sister was to marry the 
 Lord de Walden, and the ceremony was to be graced with much 
 feasting and a solemn tournament. 
 
 There was magic in all the associations with this family for 
 Hichard. In his early infancy, Thomas Movrbray, the last of 
 the dukes of Isorfolk of that name, died. It almost was beyond

192 THE EAEL OP SUEBEY. 
 
 his recollection that he had been married to the little Lady 
 Anne, the duke's only child and heiress. She died soon after ; 
 and the representative of the female branch of the Mowbrays, 
 John Howard was created duke of iSTorfolk by Eichard the Third. 
 He fell at Bosworth ; and his son, the earl of Surrey, though 
 attaching himself to Henry the Seventh, and pardoned and 
 taken into favour, was not permitted to assume his father's 
 attainted title. 
 
 At this marriage-feast the mother of his Anne, the dowager 
 duchess of Norfolk, daughter of Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, so 
 famous in the French wars, would be present ; and others of the 
 Howard and Berkeley families, all Yorkists once. The prince 
 could not resist the temptation of appearing on the lists that 
 day, where, if success crowned him, as surely it would, he could 
 •with prouder hopes call on Surrey to maintain his claims. Friou 
 got gallant armour for him, and contrived to have him, under 
 another name, inserted in the list of combatants. 
 
 York's bosom swelled with pride and exultation when he 
 saw himself among his countrymen — his subjects — with lance 
 in rest and bright shield upon his arm, about to tilt with 
 England's noblest cavaliers. It seemed to him as if he had 
 never asked more of fortune — and the herald's voice, the clarion's 
 sound, the neigh of steeds, the gallant bearing of the knights, 
 and charmed circle of joyous beauty around, were like a voice 
 from beyond life, speaking of a Paradise he had left,— his own 
 native home. But one emotion of disquiet crossed him : as 
 about to pass the barrier, Frion put his hand on his rein, and 
 whispered, " Beware of Clifford ! " The duke threw his eyes 
 round the vizored throng. With what gladness would he have 
 singled him out, and met him in fierce, mortal combat ! A 
 second thought told him that the dishonoured man could not 
 find place in this gallant company. 
 
 We will not dwell on the tilt, the thrust, and the parry, the 
 overthrowing of horses, and defeat of knights. Eichard gloried 
 in the recollection of his Spanish combats, and the love he bore 
 for martial exercises, which made him, so boyish in figure, emu- 
 late the strong acts of men. Fortune had varied : but, when at 
 noon the pastime of that day ended, the prince remained victor 
 in the field. From the hand of the queen of the feast he was 
 receiving his reward, when Surrey, who had led him to her 
 throne, was suddenly called away. The assembly broke up ; 
 and Eichard was half occupied by polite attention to the coun- 
 tess, and half by recollecting his peculiar situation, when the 
 marshal of the lists whispered him to follow — he led him to a 
 gallery, where Surrey alone was pacing backwards and forwards

 in great agitation. He stopped when tlie prince entered — mo- 
 tioned the marshal to leave them, and then, in a voice of sup- 
 pressed passion, said, "I will not ask thee wliy "v^ith a false 
 appellation thou hast insulted the feast of nobles ? — but well 
 may I ask, what fiend possessed thee to do a deed that aihxes 
 the taint of disloyalty to King Henry's liege subject ? " 
 
 " My good sword, my lord," said Kichard, colouring, " were 
 eloquent to answer your questioning, but that you are much 
 deceived; I am not indeed that which I called myself; but 
 honour, not disgrace, attaches itself to my presence. I came to 
 tell you this, to rouse the old fidelity of the Howards ; to bid 
 Lord Surrey arm for the last of tlie true Plantagenets." 
 
 *' Saint Thomas speed me ! Clifford then spoke true — thou art 
 Perkin Warbeck ? " 
 
 " I would fain," said the duke haughtily, " ask a revered lady, 
 who claims kindred with thee, what name she would give to her 
 sainted daughter's affianced husband F " 
 
 The language of truth is too clear, too complete, for the blots 
 and flaws of incredulity ; the very anger Lord Surrey had mani- 
 fested, now turned to his confusion ; the insult he had offered 
 demanded reparation ; he could not refuse his visitant's earnest 
 demand to be led to the widow of Mowbray, duke of j^Torfclk. 
 
 Elizabeth, daughter of the gallant Talbot, was proud of her 
 ancestry, and disappointed in the diminution of her house. 
 When her Anne was affianced to the little duke of York, and tho 
 nobility of Norfolk was merged in the royal style of England, 
 she had gloried ; since then, attainder and defeat had eclipsed 
 the ducal honours of her race ; nor could she forgive the alle- 
 giance of its heirs to Lancaster. Often had she pondered on the 
 reports concerning Margaret of Burgundy's White Rose; it was 
 with agitation therefore that she heard that he was to be brought 
 for her to decide on his truth. 
 
 The duke liad doffed his helm : his golden hair clustered on 
 the almost infantine candour of his brow, and shaded to softer 
 meaning the frank aspect of his clear blue eyes. The aged 
 duchess fixed her dimmed but steady gaze upon him, and at once 
 became aware that this was no ignoble pretender who stood 
 before her. His dignity inspired Surrey with respect : he hesi- 
 tated as he introduced the subject of his identity with Edward 
 the Fourth's youngest son. The duke, with a half-smile, becjan 
 to speak of his boyish recollections, and his little pretty play- 
 fellow, and of one Mistress ]Margery, her governante ; he spoke 
 of a cjuarrel with his infant bride on the very wedding-day, and 
 how nothing would bribe him to the ceremony, save the gift of 
 a pretty foal, White Surrey, which afterwards bore his uncle

 Gloucester in the battle of Bosworth. As lie spoke, he saw a 
 smile mantle over the as^cd lady's countenance ; and then he 
 alluded to his poor wife's death, and reminded the duchess, that 
 ■when clad in black, an infant widower, he had visited her in 
 condolence ; and how the sad lady had taken a jewel-encircled 
 portrait of her lost child, garnished with the blended arms of 
 Plantagenet and Mowbray, from his neck, promising to restore 
 it on an after-day, which day had never come. Tears now rushed, 
 into the duchess's eyes ; she drew the miniature from her bosom, 
 and neither she nor Lord Surrey could longer doubt, that the 
 affianced husband of the noble Anne stood before them. 
 
 Much confusion painted the earl's countenance. The duke of 
 York's first involuntary act had been to stretch out his hand ; but 
 the noble hesitated ere he could bestow on it the kiss of allegi- 
 ance. Richard marked his reluctance, and spoke with gallant 
 frankness : " I am an outcast," he said, " the victim of lukewarm 
 faith and ill-nurtured treason : I am weak, my adversary strong. 
 My lord, I will ask nothing of you ; I will not fancy that you 
 would revive the ancient bond of union between York and 
 JSTorfolk ; and yet, were it not a worthy act to pull down a base- 
 minded usurper, and seat upon his father's throne an injured 
 prince ? " 
 
 The duchess answered for him. " Oh, surely, my noble 
 cousin will be no recreant in this cause, the cause of our own so 
 exalted lineage." 
 
 But Lord Surrey had different thoughts : it cost him much to 
 express them ; for he had loved the House of York, and honoured 
 and pitied its apparent offspring. At length he overcame his 
 feelings, and said, " And, if I do not this, if I do not assist to 
 replant a standard whose staff was broken on the graves of our 
 slaughtered fathers, will your highness yet bear with me, while 
 I say a few words in my defence ? " 
 
 " It needs not, gallant Surrey," interrupted York. 
 
 *' Under favour, it does need," replied the earl ; "and withal 
 touches mine honour nearly, that it stand clear in this question. 
 My lord, the Eoses contended in a long and sanguinary war, and 
 many thousand of our countrymen fell in the sad conflict. The 
 executioner's axe accomplished what the murderous aword 
 spared, and poor England became a wide, wide grave. The 
 green-wood glade, the cultivated fields, noble castles, and smiling 
 villages were changed to churchyard and tomb : want, fjimine, 
 and hate ravaged the fated laud. My lord, 1 love not Tudor, but 
 I love my country : and now that I see plenty and peace reign 
 over this fair isle, even though Lancaster be their unworthy 
 viceregent, shall I cast forth these friends of man, to bring back

 the deadly horrors of unholy civil war? By the God that made 
 me, I cannot P I have a dear wife and lovely children, sisters, 
 friends, and all the sacred ties of humanity, that clinj^ round my 
 heart, and feed it with delight ; these I might sacrifice at the call 
 of honour, but the misery I must tlien endure I will not inflict 
 on others ; I will not people my country with widows and orphans ; 
 nor -spread the plague of death from the eastern to the western 
 sea." 
 
 Surrey spoke eloquently well ; for his heart was upon his lips. 
 Prince Ei chard heard with burning emotion. " By my fay ! " he 
 cried, " thou wouldst teach me to turn spinster, my lord : but oh, 
 cousin Howard ! did you know what it is to be an exiled man, 
 dependent on the bounty of others ; though your patrimony were 
 but a shepherd's hut on a wild nameless common, you would 
 think it well done to waste life to dispossess the usurper of your 
 right." 
 
 CHAPTER XXYII.

 Farewell, kind lord, fight valiantly to-day. 
 And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,

 The duke of York was not of a temperament to sink supinely 
 before the first obstacles. Lord Surrey's deep-felt abjuration of 
 war influenced him to sadness, but the usual habit of his mind 
 returned. He had been educated to believe that his honour 
 called on him to maintain his claims. Honour, always a magic 
 word with the good and brave, was then a part of the religion 
 of every pious heart. He had been nursed in war — the javelin 
 and the sword were as familiar to his hand as the distaflf and 
 spindle to the old Tuscan crone. In addition, the present 
 occasion called for activity. The fleet, armed for invasion, pre- 
 pared by his noble aunt — manned by his exiled zealous friends — 
 would soon appear on the English coast, giving form and force 
 to, while it necessitated hia purposed attempt. 
 
 He possessed in his secretary Frion, a counsellor, friend, and

 servant, admirably calculated to prevent all wavering. This 
 man's vanity, lion-strong, was alive to insure liis new master's 
 success, and to overthrow him by whom he had been discarded. 
 He was an adept in intrigue ; an oily flatterer ; a man of 
 unwearied activity, both of mind and body. It was his care to 
 prevent York from suffering any of the humiliations incident to 
 his position. He obtained supplies of money for him — he sufiered 
 none to approach who were not already full of zeal — when he. 
 met with any failure, he proved logically that it was a success, 
 and magnified an escape into a victory — he worked day and night 
 to insure that nothing came near the prince, except through his 
 medium, which was one sugared and drugged to please. When 
 lie saw llichard's clear spirit clouded by Lord Surrey, he demon- 
 strated that England could not suffer through him ; for that in 
 the battle it was a struggle between partizans ready to lay down 
 their lives in their respective causes, so that, for their own sakes 
 and pleasure, he ought to call on them to make the sacrifice. As 
 to the ruin and misery of the land — he bade him mark the 
 exactions o^ Henry ; the penury of the peasant, drained to his 
 last stiver — this was real wretchedness ; devastating the country, 
 and leaving it barren, as if sown with salt. ^Fertility and plenty 
 would speedily efface the light wound he must inflict — nay, 
 England would be restored to youth, and laugh through all her 
 shores and plains, when grasping Tudor was exchanged for the 
 munificient Plantagenet. 
 
 In one circumstance Frion had been peculiarly fortunate. The 
 part he had played of astrologer during the foregoing summer 
 had brought him acquainted with a young nobleman zealous in 
 the cause of York, and well able to afford it assistance. Lord 
 Audley was of the west country, but his maternal relations were 
 Kentish, and he possessed a mansion and a small estate not far 
 from Hythe in Kent. Lord Audley was of a class of men com- 
 mon all over the world. He had inherited his title and fortune 
 early in life, and was still a very young man. He loved action, and 
 desired distinction, and was disposed to enter readily into all the 
 turmoil and risk of conspiracy and revolt. His aim was to 
 become a leader : he was vain, but generous ; zealous, but defi- 
 cient m judgment. He was a Yorkist by birth and a soldier by 
 profession — all combined to render him, lieart and soul, tlie 
 friend of the wandering Plantagenet. 
 
 Erion led York to the mansion of this noble, and it became the 
 focus of the spirit of sedition and discontent to the country round. 
 The immediate presence of the duke was concealed ; but ihc 
 activity of his friends was not the less great to collect a band of 
 partizans, to which, when prepared and disciplined, they might

 present tlieir royal leader. Their chief purpose was to collect 
 such a body of men as might give one impetus to the comity, 
 when the invading fleet should arrive on these coasts from Bur- 
 gundy. Time was wanting for the complete organization of their 
 plan ; for each day they expected the vessels, and their operations 
 in consequence were a little abrupt. Still they were in hopes 
 that they should be enabled to assemble an armed force sufficient 
 to facilitate the landing and to insure the success of the expected 
 troops. Day and night these men were occupied in gathering 
 together followers. It was not long, however, before the wily 
 secretary discovered that some one was at work to counteract 
 their schemes. Those he had left transported with zeal for the 
 cause yesterday, to-day he found lukewarm or icy cold. Their 
 enemy, whoever it might be, observed great mystery in his pro- 
 ceedings ; yet he appeared to have intuitive knowledge of theirs. 
 Prion exerted himself to discover the secret cause of all the mis- 
 chief — he was liberal of promises and bribes. One day he had 
 appointed a rendezvous for a party of recruits, about a hundred 
 men, who had been exercised for the last fortnight, and promised 
 well — none arrived at the appointed spot. Prion rode sorrow- 
 fully through the dusk of the evening towards Lord Audley's 
 dweHing. He was overtaken by a horseman, with a slouched 
 hat, and otherwise muffled up : he rode at his side for a little 
 way, quite mute to all Prion's courteous salutations ; and then 
 he suddenly put spurs to his horse, and was out of sight in a 
 moment. Night grew darker; and at the mirk-embowered 
 entrance of a shady lane, Prion was startled by the tramp of a 
 horse — it was the same man : — "Maitre Prion !" he cried. 
 
 " Sir Eobert Clifford!" 
 
 " The same — I knew not that my voice was so treacherous," 
 Clifford began : he went on abruptly to declare that he was the 
 counterminer ; he, the secret marplot of the sagacious French- 
 man's schemes. He displayed in all that he said a perfect 
 knowledge of every transaction, and of the prince's present resi- 
 dence. By'r Lady's grace, he might have brought King Henry's 
 archers to Lord Audley's very door! Wherefore he had not 
 done this seemed strange ; his own account perplexed. In truth, 
 this wretched man, at war with guilt and with himself, loathed the 
 dishonour he had acquired. Like all evil-disposed persons, he 
 had no idea of purging himself from the foul stain by frank con- 
 fession and reformation : his project was to begin a new career in 
 a new country : to go where his own tarnished reputation was 
 unknown, where the cankerous name of York would poison no 
 more his native language by its perpetual recurrence. His 
 ■violent passions led Lim also to other conclusions j he hated

 Hichard, and loved Monina; his desire to satisfy botli these 
 sentiments sutrji^ested a project on whicli he no^Y acted, and which 
 dictated his discourse v»ith Frion. He showed how from that 
 very spot he might ride to London, and make disclosures to the 
 king ; his knowledge of every detail of the Yorkist plans was 
 startling — ruinous ; — his offer was simply this : — That the duchess 
 of Burgundy should pay him a thousand golden crowns ; that the 
 Spanish maiden, Monina, should consent to wed him ; and that 
 they should seek together the golden isles of the western ocean, 
 leaving the old world for York to ruffle in. 
 
 Prion desired time : it was necessary to consult Eichard, and 
 also Monina ; where should they meet again ? Clifford would 
 appoint neither time nor place : — " I shall find you," he said : 
 *' I may draw your curtain at dead of night ; come on you with 
 an armed band of men, whom you think all your own. I will 
 choose my own hour, my own audience-chamber. You have but 
 to get the damsel's consent, and to tell her, an' you list, that she 
 were better as Robin Clifford's wife, than as the light-of-love of 
 the son of Jane Shore's gallant." With these words the knight 
 rode off; and being much better mounted than the secretary, 
 put all pursuit to defiance. 
 
 Frion was full of thought. He said nothing to the duke or 
 Lord Audley ; but the following day hastened to visit Monina at 
 Canterbury, where she had resided latterly, in the character of a 
 pilgrim to St. Thomas a Becket's shrine. Frion had flattered 
 himself that he could easily persuade the young, inexperienced 
 girl, whose ardour for York he had often admired. Yet he felt 
 uncomfortable when he saw her. Monina looked a little pale, 
 and her dark religious garb gave no adornment to her beauty ; 
 but there was in the innocence and tenderness of her full dark 
 eye, in the soft moulding of the cheek which harmonized with 
 the beautiful lids, and in her 
 
 " sweet lips, like roses, 
 With their own fragrance pale, which Spring but half uncloses." 
 
 —there was in all this a purity and soft appeal which even the 
 politician felt, who looked on mankind as mere agents in the 
 drama he caused to be acted. With some hesitation he brought 
 out his story, but of course grew bolder as he proceeded. 
 Monina looked pained, but said — " Double the number of 
 crowns, and Sir Robert will content him. My father will make 
 my ransom good." 
 
 Clifford's speech and manner had convinced Frion that this 
 would not be the case ; he tried to persuade Monina, and even 
 repeated the knight's insolent message. Her large eyes grew

 larger, dilating with surprise and indignation. He little knows 
 woman, who thinks to govern the timid thing by threats. 
 " Answer that bad man," she said, " thus : Monina will wed 
 death, rather than crime and treason. Good Master Prion, you 
 have done wrong by so insulting mine ears ; it were enough to 
 drive a poor girl to eternal vows and a convjsnt, to dream that 
 such words are spoken of her ; and if I do not take that refuge, 
 it is because I will not desert my dear, fond, bereaved father — as 
 soon I shall prove ; meanwhile we must not delay to secure 
 our prince from his enemy's machinations. You know Astley, 
 the poor scrivener in this town ? I defy Cliflford to win him. 
 Bring his highness there, I will prepare him. We must show a 
 boldness to Clifford matching his own ; let us be fearless for our- 
 selves ; and for the White Eose we need not fear. Stay; 
 Cliflford watches you ; I will provide for the duke's safety." 
 
 That very night, by secret, unknown means (it miglit be 
 through her gipsy friend), Monina had communicated with York, 
 and induced him to take refuge with the man she named. 
 Astley's father had been a soldier in the cause of York, and had 
 died on Bosworth Field, leaving an unprovided widow and five 
 children, one only among them being a son. From his youth 
 upward, the boy had struggled, not with privation on his own 
 account, to that he submitted without a murmur, but for the 
 sake of his mother and sisters, whom he loved with an ardour 
 peculiar to his sensitive and affectionate disposition. Weak in 
 health and strength, he had betaken himself to the occupation of 
 a scrivener, so meagrely to support them. It is probable that, 
 in the frame of all, there was a delicacy of organization that 
 unfitted them for penury. One by one they died. That spring 
 had left Astley comparatively rich, because he could well sup- 
 port himself, but miserable beyond words, for he idolized all and 
 every one of his lost relatives. Frion had, with unwearied care, 
 made an accurate enumeration of all in Canterbury who had 
 ever favoured the White Eose. Astley was on this fist ; he saw 
 him, and passed him over as useless. Chance brought him and 
 Monina together, who instantly detected his latent, unpractised 
 talents, his integrity and enthusiasm; now his habitation 
 occurred as an unsuspected and faithful asylum for her perse- 
 cuted friend. 
 
 Frion was still at work ; Clifford came on him suddenly, and 
 heard with unrepressed rage his rejection by Monina ; his threats 
 were unmeasured ; but the moment for putting them into execu- 
 tion to their full extent had gone by. On the very day that 
 York arrived in safety at Canterbury, his fleet was seen off 
 Hythe. In the morning the vessels hoye in sight j towards

 eveninfT they bore down upon land, and anchored in the offinnf. 
 The land-breeze rising at evening tide secured them from the 
 dangers of a lee shore. 
 
 Hythe is situated at the water's edge. The cliffs, which at 
 Dover beetle so fearfully over the tremendous deep, have by 
 degrees receded from their apparent task of paling in the ocean, 
 and as they retire inland, lose their barren, precipitous aspect, 
 and become green, wooded hills, overlooking a grassy plain, 
 which extends from their feet to the sands, a distance of about 
 half a mile. In the neighbourhood of Hythe a ravine, the bed 
 of a stream, divides these acclivities, which on one side are abrupt, 
 on the other softly rounded as they gradually disappear. Arcadia 
 seems to breathe from the fertile landscape ; the sunny uplands, 
 the fringed banks of the rivulet, the darker shadows of the 
 wooded hills, are contrasted with the verdant meadows, on which 
 cattle and sheep graze. But the sea, the dark, dangerous sea, 
 with barking waves and vast encircling barrenness, suddenly 
 cheeks the beauty of the earth, adding magnificence to the 
 pastoral prospect. 
 
 A few days before, some gipsies had pitched their tents near 
 the stream : some of the wanderers had strolled down to Hythe ; 
 but they were looked on for the most part with suspicion and 
 fear. Now, while at the close of day most of the inhabitants of 
 the little town were collected on the beach, gazing on the 
 anchored vessels, two stout-looking gipsy-men, with one old 
 woman of their tribe, were lying on the sands, occupied, in their 
 lazy way, by the same object, the vessels in sight. The people 
 of Hythe, fishers, or such poor traders as supplied the fishermen 
 with a few coarse necessaries, were roused from the usual mono- 
 tony of their lives by the aspect of this fleet. Added to these, 
 there were three or four mendicant friars ; an old soldier or two, 
 disabled in the wars of the two Koses, and a few dependents on 
 neighbouring nobles or Franklins ; while women and children of 
 various ages filled up the group. They all spoke of the fleet : it 
 consisted of five armed vessels ; two of these were weather- 
 beaten caravels, two were low-decked Flemish smacks, but the 
 fifth was one of prouder build, and it bore a flag of pretension on 
 its mizen. The French king and the Spaniard were spoken of 
 first ; some thought it was a fleet which had sought the unknown, 
 golden lands, driven back upon the old world by the continuous 
 west winds of the last month ; some said, they belonged to the 
 duchy of Burgundy ; there was a spell in tfiat word ; no one 
 knew who first whispered the name ; none could guess whence 
 or wherefore the conjecture arose, but the crowd broke into 
 smaller groups j their talk declined into whispers as " York,"

 ''Duke Perkln," "The White Kose," "The dnchess of Eur- 
 gundy," were mentioned ; and the fleet grew as they spoke into 
 a mighty armada, freighted with invasion, ready to disembark an 
 army, to ravage and conquer the island. 
 
 As soon as the appearance and nature of these vessels became 
 confirmed, the gipsies arose from their indolent posture and re- 
 treated to their encampment. A few minutes afterwards, a wild- 
 looking youth on a shaggy horse, without a saddle, trotted off at 
 a quick pace through the ravine to the inland country. Lord 
 Audley and Friou heard from him of the arrival of their friends, 
 who they had expected would have been delayed for another 
 month. Prion instantly set off for Canterbury to apprise the 
 prince ; and the noble lost no time in collecting his retainers and 
 hastening' to Hythe. Clifford's spies brought him word also of 
 the arrival of the fleet. Ill-luck attended his guiles.^ Zing 
 Henry was in the north : there was no time to apprise him, and 
 Clifford's underhand proceedings might turn out bitterly to his 
 disadvantage. He had nothing for it but to endeavour to be the 
 first to convey the already -blown news to Sir John Peachy, 
 sheriff for Kent : his pains were rewarded by his being detained 
 prisoner as a suspected person, while Sir John mustered his 
 yeomanry, and, together with the neighbouring gentry and their 
 retainers, marched towards Hythe. The wavering people, awed 
 by this show of legal and military power, grew cool towards the 
 White Eose, whose name, linked to change and a diminution of 
 taxation, had for a moment excited their enthusiasm. Some had 
 assumed the snowy badge, and collected in groups ; but they 
 tore it off when the magistrate appeared ; he thanked them for 
 arming for their king, and they, in much fear and some wonder, 
 joined his standard. 
 
 Sir John advanced with his increasing troop towards the 
 village in question. He was informed that a band of the 
 prince's friends was there before him, consisting of a few Yorkist 
 gentlemen and their retainers. His first idea was to disperse 
 them ; his second, " No ; this will serve as a decoy ; every 
 coast may not be prepared ; driven too speedily hence, the 
 armament may make good their landing elsewhere : if we 
 appear unguarded, they will disembark, and fall into our 
 hands." This policy had good effect ; the two smaller Dutch 
 vessels and one of the caravels ran as close in shore as their 
 soundings permitted, and hastily landed a part of the 
 troops. The commanders of the expedition on board the fleet 
 had been in considerable anxiety ; they had hoped to find the 
 country raised to receive them ; they saw but a handful of 
 men j "still signs were made to them to disembark -, and, eager

 to insure the safety of their prince, they in part obeyed, landing 
 about two hundred and fifty men, ■with Mountford, Corbet, and 
 some other distinguished exiles, at their head. York and 
 Frion had not yet had time to arrive from Canterbury ; Lord 
 Audley and his friends received the troops, and held consulta- 
 tion with their chiefs. It was resolved to go forward, and pene- 
 trate into the country, to raise it if possible ; and, as they had 
 not yet heard of Sir John Peachy's advance, to forestall re- 
 sistance by their speed. 
 
 They marched forward in good order for nearly ten miles, 
 when they halted ; their scouts here brought intelligence of 
 a regular force of at least two thousand men who were near at 
 hand, advancing against them. Audley advised a deviation 
 from their line of march, so as to enter the county in a different 
 direction ; Mountford proposed to fortify themselves in Hythe ; 
 Corbet to re-embark with all speed on board their vessels. 
 While they deliberated, it was reported that another troop of 
 the king's men were posted in their rear, while a herald from 
 the sheriff called on them to lay down their arms and to 
 submit. Already a panic ran through this knot of men ; already 
 their coward hands dropped their weapons, ready to be held out 
 for servile cords, signs of terror increased by the near tramp 
 of Peachy's soldiers and the sound of martial music. 
 
 At this moment of irresolution, four persons were seen at 
 the top of a neighbouring eminence ; one was a knight in 
 complete armour, the others were more peacefully attired ; they 
 paused a moment gazing on the scene below ; then the three 
 pursued their way over the hills towards the sea ; the cavalier 
 came riding down at a furious pace ; Lord Audley advanced 
 towards him. " All is lost ! " he cried. 
 
 ** Or won ! " exclaimed the prince ; " surely Neville and my 
 good cousin will send us reinforcements. How strong are ye 
 on board, Mountford ? " 
 
 " About six hundred ; two of which are German well-trained 
 auxiliaries ; but we hoped to find an ally army." 
 
 *' Treason, Sir John, is stronger to break, than truth to bind. 
 Ye are mad ; better not have landed at all than thus." 
 
 A few scattered shot from Peachy's advanced guard broke 
 in upon these regrets ; Richard in a moment recollected that 
 this was a time for action, not for words. He issued a few- 
 commands as to the position of his troops, and riding to their 
 front addressed them : " My merry men, and very good friends," 
 he cried, " let us recollect that we are soldiers ; our lives depend 
 upon our swords ; draw them for the right, and be strong in 
 it. Our enemies are chiefly raw recruits j cold friends of a

 tyrant-usurper ; but they are many, and deatli is before us ; 
 behind our vessels, the wide ocean, safet}^ and freedom ; we 
 must retreat, not as cowardly fugitives, but as men who, while 
 they see, fear not their danger." 
 
 The order of the march was speedily established. While the 
 rear retrograded, Eichard, with a hundred chosen men, made 
 a stand, receiving so well the first onset of their assailants, that 
 they were staggered and driven back. 
 
 *' In good hour, spare neither whip nor spur," cried York ; 
 and turning his horse's head, he galloped towards his retreating 
 friends. Peachy, who believed that he had them in his toils, 
 followed slowly and in good order. For the first five miles all 
 went well ; but when the hills approached and grew more abrupt, 
 forming by degrees a narrow ravine, they found this post 
 guarded by the enemy. "Betrayed!" cried Audley ; "w^e 
 ought to have traversed the hills ; now we are between two 
 fires." 
 
 " Silence !" said Eichard, sternly ; "we must give courage to 
 these poor fellows, not deprive them of it — fear you for your 
 life, baron ? By my fay, I had rather mine were spilt, than 
 that of the meanest of our men ! " 
 
 Combat like this York had shared in the ravines of Anda- 
 lusia: he remembered that warfare, and founded his present 
 operations upon it. His onset was impetuous ; the enemy re- 
 coiled, but formed again. The horsemen dismounted, and pre- 
 sented a frightful bulwark of iron-headed lances to the horses 
 of the little troop ; while, from the intervals in the ranks, the 
 archers and men armed with matchlocks kept up a rain of 
 arrows and bullets, that spread consternation among his troop. 
 It was necessary to break through this formidable defence ; 
 thrice the prince charged in vain ; the third time his standard- 
 bearer fell ; he wore a white scarf; he fixed it to his lance, and 
 drawing his sword, he waved this emblem of his cause as again 
 he dashed forwards, and with greater success ; yet, as he drove 
 the enemy before him, the whiz of bullets and arrows from 
 behind showed that their previous resistance had given Sir John 
 Peachy time to come up. York grasped Audley's hand : " Fare- 
 well," he cried, " forgive my hasty speech, my valiant friend ; 
 may we meet in paradise, where surely, through G-od's grace, 
 we shall sup 'this night." 
 
 With the words he charged again, and overcame the last 
 faint resistance. Followed by all his troop, pursuing the flying, 
 Eichard dashed through the defile : soon the open plain was 
 before them, and he saw the wide, calm, free ocean, with his 
 vessels riding at anchor. The decks were crowded with men,

 and tlie water covered with boats, hovering near shore, as they 
 waited to reeeive tidings of their friends. 
 
 Before in the van, Eichard now hnng back to secure the 
 retreat of those behind. Audley urged him to embark ; but he 
 moved slowly towards the beach, now callinf' his men to form 
 and gather round him, now markinsr the motions of those 
 behmd, ready to ride back to their aid. At length Peachy 'a 
 troops poured through the defile ; the plain was covered by 
 flying Yorkists : it only remained for him to assemble as many 
 as he could, to protect and insure the embarkation of all. 
 
 " One word," cried Audley ; " whither do you propose to sail?" 
 
 " It is doubtful ; if Barry still be true, and my voice be heard, 
 not to Burgundy and dependence, but rather to Ireland, to Cork 
 and Desmond." 
 
 " Meanwhile, dear your highness," said the noble, " I will not 
 believe that all is lost in England. I shall make good spee'd to 
 the West, and gather my friends together ; we shall not be distant 
 neighbours ; and if I succeed to my wish, Audley will call you 
 from your Irish fastnesses to your own native England. Our 
 Lady preserve you meanwhile — farewell ! " 
 
 Audley, swift in all his proceedings, put spurs to his horse, 
 and was away. A few minutes brought Eichard to the sands ; 
 he guarded the embarkation of his diminished numbers ; nor, 
 till Peachy 's troop was within bowshot, and the last straggler 
 that arrived was in the last boat, did he throw himself from his 
 horse and leap in ; he was rowed to the chief vessel. He cast 
 an anxious glance at the Adalid, just under weigh ; a green and 
 white flag was hoisted; Moniua was on board. Further to 
 reassure him of his friends' safety, Frion received him as he 
 mounted on his own deck. Evening was at hand — the late 
 balmy summer evening ; a land breeze sprung up; the vessels 
 had already weighed their anchors, and swiftly, with swelling 
 sails, they gained the oflSng. How tranquil and sweet seemed 
 the wide-spread waters ; how welcome these arks of refuge, 
 sailing placidly over them, after the strife, the blood, the shouts, 
 the groans of battle. "Farewell, England," said the royal 
 exile; "I have no country, save these decks trodden by my 
 friends — where they are, there is my kingdom and my home ! "

 CHAPTER XXVIII. 
 
 THE PAETING. 
 
 Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot : 
 And then the power of Scotland and of York 
 
 To join 
 
 In laith it is exceedingly well aimed ! 
 
 Shassfearb. 
 
 The dute of York found Lord Barry, Sir George Neville, 
 Plantagenet, and several other distinguished friends, on board 
 his vessel. In consultation vrith them, it was agreed to sail 
 immediately for Cork. The loss of many brave friends, killed 
 or prisoners, on the Kentish coast, saddened them : while the 
 diminution of their numbers forbade the idea of a second descent 
 upon England. Towards Ireland they sailed, with such alterna- 
 tion of calm and contrary winds as made them linger for several 
 weeks upon their way. Here, for the first time, Eichard heard 
 from Erion of Clifford's machinations, and of his message and 
 insolent threat to Monina. Every drop of blood in his veins 
 ■was alive with indignation : before, he had despised Sir Eobert 
 as a traitor ; and, while he looked on him as the cause of all his 
 disasters, and of the death of so many of his noble and gallant 
 adherents, his abhorrence was mingled with contemptuous pity. 
 The unchivalrous wrong offered to a woman, that woman his 
 sweet sister-friend, animated him with other feelings : to avenge 
 her, and chastise the arrogant braggart, was his knightly duty, 
 his fervent, impatient wish. He saw her not meanwhile ; she 
 was in one of those dark hulls, among which love alone taught 
 him to discern the lighter build and more sea-worn frame of the 
 Ad alt d. 
 
 Ireland was at this time very differently situated from when 
 the prince first landed on her shores. After Lambert Simnel's 
 success there, still the king of England had neglected its internal 
 policy. A more terrible name awakened his cafition ; and he 
 sent Sir Edward Poynings, as the deputy of his inftint son Henr}'-, 
 whom he had nominally appointed to the government. Poynings

 ■vras resolute and snccessfu]. He defeated the natives, quelled 
 the earl of Kildare, and forced the earl of Desmond to renew his 
 oaths of allej^iance. A free pardon was afterwards granted to all, 
 with the exception of Lord Barry. 
 
 York was received at Cork most cordially by his old friend 
 O'Water, and immediately, at the earl of Desmond's invitation, 
 repaired to Ardfinnin. The earl had found no great difficulty 
 in escaping from England, and returnin? to his native island. 
 The timely assistance he had aflPorded Henry's enemv in the 
 Tower was an impenetrable mystery, though the consciousness 
 of it had made him more vieldine: than he would otherwise have 
 been in his concessions to Poynings, He received York with 
 the hospitality of an Irish chieftain, and the kindness of a friend. 
 But he held out no inducement for him to remain : on the con- 
 trary, he was the first to counsel him to turn his eyes, where a 
 new and brighter prospect presented itself. Sir Patrick Hamil- 
 ton had left Munster a few months before, with a firm belief in 
 [Richard's truth ; he had assured the earl of the favourable 
 reception his adventurous friend would obtain from his royal 
 master, and had declared his intention of proceeding to Brussels 
 to see the prince, and personally to enforce his invitation. York 
 was absent; but the duchess gave a cordial reception to the 
 renowned Scottish cavalier. He had been present at the sailing 
 of the fleet ; and his last words were wishes for their success, 
 and an offer of secure and honourable refuge in Edinburgh, in 
 case of failure. It had been agreed, that on his own return 
 thither, he should be accompanied by messengers from the 
 duchess, to thank the king of Scotland for the interest he mani- 
 fested towards her beloved nephew. Sir Edward Brampton wag 
 chosen as the chief of these, accompanied, of course, by his lady, 
 York's long-tried and zealous friend. 
 
 All these circumstances were decisive of the course it became 
 the exile to pursue. He was at that moment in a condition to 
 appear under advantageous circumstances at the Scottish court. 
 He had lost several valued friends during the late attempt ; but 
 many remained of noble birth and good renown. Above a 
 hundred knights graced his train. The treasure his aunt had 
 bestowed for his English struggle remained, besides a con- 
 siderable sum of money, services of valuable plate and valuable 
 jewels, the munificent gift of the dowager duchess of Norfolk. 
 In tine, not a dissentient voice was raised ; and the attention of 
 every one was turned towards preparations for the voyage. York 
 continued to be the earl of Desmond's guest : in his princely 
 halls he received all the honour due to his rank and pretensions. 
 The countess, a lady of the noble family of Eoche, distinguished

 him by her kindness, and conceived a peculiar friendship for the 
 Spanish maiden, Monina. 
 
 The moment arrived for York's embarkation. He had visited 
 his vessels, and seen that all was in readiness; but his surprise 
 was excited by perceiving that no preparations were made for 
 sailing on board the Adalid. This was explained on his return, 
 by the countess telling him that a friend of his desired to take 
 leave of him before he sailed, and that she had been besought by 
 her to explain in some measure the reasons of their separation. 
 De Faro's whole soul was set upon becoming one of those im- 
 mortal pioneers who opened new paths across the unexplored 
 west. He could be of no use to Kichard in Scotland ; but he 
 could not prevail on himself to leave his lovely, unprotected girl 
 behind. She had at last consented to accompany him in his far 
 and dangerous voyage. 
 
 Many had been this poor child's struggles, sad her reflections, 
 ere she wrought herself to this purpose. " Alas ! " such were 
 her reveries, " that innocence should be no safeguard in this ill 
 world ! If indeed I loved him sinfully, or he sought me wrong- 
 fully, I should simply obey the laws of God in flying him ; but 
 he is noble, and I know my own heart. Spotless Mother of God, 
 thou knowest it ! — there is no single feeling in my woman's soul 
 that I dare not avouch to thy all-blessed gentleness ! I ask only 
 to live in the same land, to breathe the same air, to serve him 
 at his need, to associate with his friends ; so that when I see him 
 not, I may feed upon discourse of him. This is all I ask — all ! 
 — and this must not be ! I cannot bear a tainted name ; I can- 
 not endure that, linked with any slightest stain of calumny, my 
 image should haunt his dreams ; nor that he or any human being 
 should suffer through me, which may so easily happen : for if 
 words like those Frion reported should reach my father's ears, 
 he would clothe his tempest-shaken limbs in arms, and expose 
 his breast to the sharp sword's point, to vindicate my hoiiour. 
 No ! — no tragedy shall be associated with poor Monina's name ; 
 nor agony nor woe shall visit those I love, through me : they 
 shall not even commiserate my sufferings ; these shall be garnered 
 up in my own heart, watched with a miser's care. 1 will not 
 enrich the tell-tale air by one sigh ; nor through my broken 
 heart shall the gloom of my despair appear. I will paint my 
 face with joy's own hue ; put sunshine in my eyes : my hapless 
 love shall be no tale of pity for any, save my own desolate 
 thoughts. Nor let me forget every lesson of resignation, nor 
 the dear belief I cherish in the protection and goodness of my 
 sainted guardianess. Let me rejoice at much that exalts my 
 destiny in my own eyes. The prince's friendship, affection,

 gratitude, and esteem are mine : I have been able to serve liim 
 I love — am I not sufficiently fortunate ? He needs me no more ; 
 but I am no alien upon eartli. I shall give delight to my dear 
 father by accompanying him over the untrod watery deserts : 
 through me — for, if I went not, he would remain behind — the 
 name of De Faro will be added to the list of those who be- 
 stow a new creation of supernal beauty on our out-worn world. 
 He will call me the partner of his glory ; and, though that be a 
 vain word, his dark eyes will flash with joy. My dear, dear 
 father I Should the prince succeed and ascend his rightful 
 throne, more impassable than that wide sea would be the gulph 
 which ceremony would place between us ; and if he fall — ah ! 
 mine is no summer's day voyage ; the tornados of that wild 
 region may wreck me ; the cold sea receive me in her bosom ; 
 and I shall never hear of Hichard's overthrow, nor endure the 
 intolerable pang of knowing that he dies." 
 
 Fortified in some degree by such thoughts, anxious to conceal 
 her sorrows from one who might compassionate, yet not wholly 
 share them, Monina met Eichard with an air of gaiety : glad, in 
 spite of his involuntary mortification, that she should be spared 
 any pain, he copied her manner ; and a spectator would have 
 thought, that either they parted for a few hours, or were indif- 
 ferent to each other. He could not help betraying some anxiety 
 however, when Lady Desmond, who was present, solicited him 
 to make his friend change her purpose, and drew a frightful 
 picture of the hazardous voj'age, the storms, the likelihood that 
 they might be driven far, far away, Mhere no land was, where 
 they would perish of famine on the barren, desolate ocean. 
 Monina laughed — she endeavoured thus to put aside her friend's 
 serious entreaties ; and, when she found that she failed, she 
 spoke of the Providence that could protect her even on the 
 wastes of innavigable ocean ; and proudly reminded him, that 
 she would trust her father, whose reputation as a mariner stood 
 foremost among those in the king of Portugal's employ. Hichard 
 looked perplexed — sorrow and pain spoke in his own coun- 
 tenance ; while she, true to herself to the last, said, "I have 
 now told you my purpose — but this is no farewell ; to-morrow 
 we meet again ; and another to-morrow will come also, when I 
 bring treasure from my Indian isle to dazzle the monarch of 
 fair, happy England." 
 
 ■ On that morrow Eichard sought in vain among the countess 
 of Desmond's companions for his sweet Spaniard ; he imaged 
 her as he last saw her, light, laughing, her soft-beaming eyes 
 hardly daring to glance towards him, while he fancied that ii 
 shower of precious drops was shaken from their fringed lids.

 He Iiad mennt to say, " All ! weep, Monina, weep for Aucla- 
 liisia — for our liappy childhood — for the hopes that leaves us : 
 thy tears will seem to me more glad than thy untrue smile." 
 But she was not there. Could he have seen her from the deck 
 of his vessel, markinp^ its proo-ress from the watch-tower of 
 Yon<ihall, he had been satisfied. The anf^uish of bitter tears, 
 the heart's agonizintj p^aspings, were hers, to be succeeded by 
 the dull starless uij^ht of despair, when his sail vanished on the 
 glittering plains of the sunny sea. 
 
 Farewell to her who mourned ; to her who saw neither day 
 nor joy, whose heart lived with him, while she prepared for her 
 melancholy separation from the very world which he inhabited. 
 
 The scene shifts to Scotland ; and hither, to a new country, a 
 new people, almost to a new language, our royal adventurer is 
 transported. Dark, tumultuous, stained with blood, and ren- 
 dered foul by treason, are the .pages of early Scottish history. 
 A wild and warlike people inhabited its mountainous districts, 
 whose occupation was strife, whose religion was power and 
 revenge. The Lowlanders, a wealthier race, were hardly more 
 cultivated or less savage. One course of rebellion against the 
 sovereign, and discord among themselves, flows, a sanguinary 
 stream from the hidden sources of things, threading a long track 
 of years, or overflowing it with its pernicious waves. Discord, 
 hate, and murder were the animating spirits of the scene. 
 
 James the Third was a weak, unhappy man. A prophecy had 
 induced him to distrust all the princes of his house — he extended 
 this distrust to his son, who was brought up consequently in a 
 kind of honourable and obscure imprisonment. He fostered 
 unworthy favourites ; and many bold and sanguinary revolts 
 had been the consequence. Oa one occasion, while encamped 
 during a foray into England, his nobles had seized on all his 
 personal friends and adherents, and hanged them over Loudon 
 Bridge. The last rebellion cost him his life. The insurgents 
 seized on, and placed at their head, his eldest son, then only 
 sixteen years of age — they met their sovereign in the field — he 
 fled before them ; and his death was as miserable and dastardly 
 as his life. 
 
 James the Fourth succeeded to the throne. The mean 
 jealousy of his father had caused him to be untutored ; but he 
 was one of those beings, who by nature inherit magnauimit}^ 
 refinement, and generosity. His faults were those that belong to 
 such a character. His imagination was active, his impulses warm 
 but capricious. He was benignant to every other, severe only 
 in his judgment of himself. His father's death, to which he 
 had been an unwilling accessary, weighed like parricide on his 
 
 p

 conscicnco. To expiate it, in the spirit of those times, he wore 
 perpetually an iron girdle, augmenting the weight each year, as 
 habit or increasing strength lightened the former one. He 
 devoted much of his life to penance and prayer. Here ended, 
 however, all of the ascetic in his disposition. He was a gallant 
 knight and an accomxjlished gentleman. He encouraged 
 tourneys and passages of arms, raising the reputation of the 
 Scottish cavaliers all over Europe, so that many noble foreigners 
 repaired to Edinburgh, to gain new trophies in contests with 
 the heroes of the north. He passed edicts to enforce the 
 schooling of the children of the nobles and lairds. Plis general 
 love of justice, a little impaired it is true by feudal prejudices, 
 often led him to wander in disguise over his kingdom ; seeking 
 hospitality from the poor, and listeiiing with a candid and 
 generous mind to every remark upon himself and his govern- 
 ment. 
 
 He was singularly handsome, graceful, prepossessing, and yet 
 dignified in his manners. He loved pleasure, and was the slave 
 of the sex, which gives to pleasure all its elegance and refine- 
 ment ; he partook his fam^ily's love for the arts, and was 
 himself a poet and a musician ; nay more, to emulate the divine 
 patron of these accomplishments, he was well-skilled in surgery, 
 and the science of healing. He was ambitious, active, energetic, 
 He ruminated many a project of future glory ; meanwhile his 
 chief aim was to reconcile the minds of the alienated nobles — 
 his murdered father's friends — to himself; and, succeeding in 
 this, to abolish the feuds that raged among the peers of Scot- 
 land, and civilize their barbarous propensities. He succeeded 
 to a miracle. His personal advantages attracted the affection 
 of his subjects ; they were proud of him, and felt exalted by his 
 virtues. His excellent government and amiable disposition, 
 both united to make his reign peaceful in its internal policy, and 
 beneficial to the kingdom. The court of Holyrood vied v»ith 
 those of Paris, London, aud Brussels ; to which capitals niany of 
 his high-born subjects, no longer engaged in the struggles of 
 party, travelled ; bringing back with them the refinements of 
 gallantry, the poetry, learning, and science of the south of 
 Europe. The feuds, last flickerings of the dying torch of 
 discord, which lately spread a fatal glare through the land, 
 ceased ; if every noble did not love, they all obeyed their 
 sovereign — thus a new golden age might be said to have 
 dawned upon this eyrie of Boreas, this tempestuous Thule of the 
 world. 
 
 "VVe must remember that this was the age of chivalry; the, 
 spirit of Edward the Third and the princely dukes of Burgundy

 yet survived. Louis the Eleventli, in France, h.id done much 
 to quench it ; it burnt bright again under the auspices of his 
 son. Henry the Seventh was its bitter enemy ; but we are still 
 at the beginning of his reign, while war and arms were uuex- 
 tinguisiied by his cold avaricious policy. James of Scotland 
 laboured, and successfully, to pacify his subjects, children of one 
 common parent ; but he, as well as they, disdained the ignoble 
 arts of peace. England formed the lists where they desired to 
 display their courage ; war with England was a word to animate 
 every heart to dreadful joy : in the end, it caused the destruction 
 of him and all his chivalry in Flodden Field ; now it made him 
 zealous to upraise a disinherited prince ; so that under the idea 
 of restoring the rightful sovereign to the English throne, he 
 might have fair pretext for invading the neighbour kingdom. 
 At the hope, the soldiers of Scotland — in other words, its whole 
 population — awakened, as an unhooded hawk, ready to soar at 
 its accK?Lomed quarry. 
 
 Sir Patrick Hamilton, the most accomplished and renowned 
 of the Scottish cavaliers, and kinsman of the royal house, had 
 returned laden with every testimony of the White Eose's truth, 
 and a thousand proofs of his nobleness and virtue. Sir Edward 
 Brampton delivered the duchess's message of thanks ; and his 
 lady had already awakened the zeal of many a gentleman, and 
 the curiosity and interest of many a lady, for the pride of York, 
 the noble, valiant Plantagenet. Woman's sway was great at 
 Holyrood ; as the bachelor king, notwithstanding his iron girdle, 
 and his strict attention to his religious duties, was a devout votary 
 at the shrine of feminine beauty. 
 
 There was a hawking party assembled in the neighbourhood 
 of Stirling, which he graced by his presence. All was, appa- 
 rently, light-heartedness and joy, till a dispute arose between 
 two damsels upon the merits of their respective falcons. One 
 of these was fair Mary Boyd, daughter of the laird of Bonshaw. 
 IMary Boyd was the first-love of the young sovereign, and the 
 report went, that he was no unsuccessful suitor ; it spoke of 
 offspring carefully concealed in a village of Fife, whom James 
 often visited. When, afterwards, this young lady's example was 
 imitated by others nobly born, this became no secret, and of her 
 children, one became archbishop of St. Andrew's — the other, a 
 daughter, married the earl of Morton. 
 
 But tiiese were days of youthful bashfiduess and reserve ; the 
 mind of Mary Boyd balanced between pride in her lover, and 
 shame for her fault ; a state of feeling that ill brooked the loss 
 of what gilded her too apparent frailty — the exclusive attention 
 of the king. Mary was older than the king ; the dignity which

 had captivated tlie boy's imao;ination, lost its cliarm wlien the 
 tyranny of assumed right took the place of that of tenderness. He 
 grew cold, then absent, and at last, ventured to fix a regard of 
 admiration on another, sliding easily from the restraint to which he 
 at first submitted, into all of devotion, and soft, gallant courtesy, 
 by which kings win ladies' love, and in which none grew to be a 
 greater adept than James. The new object that attracted him 
 was, the young, gay, and lovely Lady Jane Kennedy, daughter 
 of the earl of Cassils. Her sparkling eyes, her '* bonny brent 
 brow," her dark, clustering hair, contrasted with the transparency 
 of her complexion — her perfect good-humour, her vivacity, and 
 her wit — made her a chief beauty in the Scottish court, and in 
 all this she was the reverse of the fair, light-haired, sleepy-eyed 
 Mary. Lady Jane saw and gloried in her triumph over the 
 king. Innocent then, she only desired the reputation of such a 
 conquest, fully resolved not to tread in the steps of her rival. 
 It is something of fool's play to strive to enchain fire by links of 
 straw, to throw silken fetters on abounding torrent, to sport with 
 the strong lion, Love, as he were a playful whelp : some, secure 
 in innocence and principle, may at last discover their mistake 
 and remain uninjured ; but not the vain, heedless, self-willed, 
 Lady Jane. The courtiers were divided in their attentions ; 
 some for shame would not forsake Mary Boyd ; some thought 
 that still she would regain her power; one or two imagined that 
 Lady Jane's resistance would restore the king to her rival ; but 
 the greater number caught the light spirit of the hour, and 
 gathered round the laughing, happy girl. 
 
 The contention between these ladies made many smile. The 
 king betted a diamond against a Scotch pebble on Lady Jane's 
 bird. Mary had thwarted him, and forced him to her side during 
 the first part of the day — now he took his revenge. A heron 
 rose from the river banks. The birds were unhooded, and up 
 soared Lady Jane's in one equal flight through the blue air, 
 cleaving the atmosphere with noiseless wing. Mary's followed 
 slower ; but, when Lady Jane's pounced on the quarry, and 
 brought it screaming and flapping to the ground, the rival bird 
 darted on the conqueror, and a sharp struggle ensued. It was 
 unequal ; for the Lady Jane's hawk would not quit its prey. 
 "Let them fight it ou';," said Mary, "and the survivor is 
 surely the victor." 
 
 But the spectators cried shame — while Lady Jane, with a 
 scream, hastened to save her favourite. The other, fiery as a 
 borderer, attacked even her; and, in spite of her gloves, drops 
 of libod from her fiiir hand, stained her silken robe. James 
 came to her rescue, and with one blow put an end to the ofl'ender's

 life. Jane caressed lier "tassel gentle," while Mary looted on 
 her " false carrion's " extinction with nnrepressed indignation. 
 They returned to Stirling : immediately on their arrival, they 
 received tidings that the duke of York's fleet had been descried, 
 and was expected to enter the Frith on the following day. None 
 heard the words without emotion; the general sentiment was 
 ■joy ; for Eichard's landing was to be the signal of invasion. 
 Xing Henry had one or two friends among the Scottish nobles, 
 and these alone smiled contemptuously. 
 
 " We must have feasts and tourneys, fair mistress," said the 
 king, " to honour our royal visitor. Will your servant intrude 
 unseemingly if, while his arms extol your beauty, he wears your 
 colours ? " 
 
 Lady Jane smiled a reply, as she followed her father towards 
 his mansion. She smiled, while feminine triumph beamed in her 
 eye, and girlish bashfulness blushed in her cheek. " Has she 
 not a bonny ee? " cried James, to him who rode near him. It 
 was Sir Patrick Hamilton, his dear cousin and friend, to whom 
 James often deferred, and respected, while he loved. His serious 
 look recalled the king. " This is not the time, good sooth ! " he 
 continued, " for such sweet gauds — but for lance, and broad- 
 sword : — the coming of this prince of Roses will bring our arms 
 into play, all rusty as they are. I wonder what presence our 
 guest may have ! " 
 
 The friends then conversed concerning the projected war, 
 which both agreed would be well-timed. It would at once give 
 vent to the fiery impulses of the Scotch lords, otherwise apt to 
 prey upon each other. But lately a band of the Drummonds 
 had burnt the kirk of Moulward, in which were six-score 
 Murrays, with their wives and children, all of whom wer^ 
 victims. But foray in England — war with the land of their 
 hate — the defiance would be echoed in glad shouts from Tweed 
 to Tay, from the Lothians to the Carse of Gowrie ; while it 
 should be repeated in groans from the Northumberland wilds.

 The clulce of York arriyed off Leitb. While tlie messengers 
 were goiDg to and fro, and preparation was made to dis- 
 embark, lie and his principal friends were assembled on the 
 deck of their vessel, regardinfj; this strange northern coast with 
 curiosity, wonder, and some contempt. 
 
 " I see horses," cried Lord Barry ; " b^^'r Lord's grace, grass 
 grows hitherward — that is much ! " 
 
 " I see kye," exclaimed Frion, " so we may hope for buttered 
 sowans at least, if not beef, at the palace of feasts." 
 
 "Ay," cried Sir Edward Brampton, who had come on board, 
 " you may hope for choice cheer. I promise ye shall live well, 
 ye that are noble — these unclad rocks and desert moors are the 
 home of many an earl and belted knight, whose gorgeousness 
 may vie with the cavaliers of France or Burgundy. In this it 
 differs from England, ye will not find stout franklins or fat 
 burgesses ; there are no men of Ghent, nor London aldermen : 
 the half-naked kern tills the stony soil. I^ext to the palace is 
 the hearthless hovel. Wealth and penury, if not mates, arc 
 joint masters of tlie land." 
 
 " I have heard,^' said York, " that there is much paternal love 
 and filial duty between tlie rich and poor in this country." 
 
 " Among the northern moimtains thus it is," said Brampton ; 
 *' a strange and savage race, which, my good Lord Barry, some 
 name Irish, dwell on the barren heights, along the impassable 
 dciiles, beside their vast stormy lakes ; but the Lowlander 
 looks askance on the Highland clanship. List ye, gentlemen ; 
 all bears a different aspect here from the gentle southern 
 kingdoms ; l:uit they are men, proud, valiant, warlike men, as

 sucli tliey claim our respect. _ His majesty and a few others arc 
 moreover right gallant cavaliers." 
 
 " ]\Iark these words," said York, earnestly, " and remember, 
 dear friends, that we, the world's wanderers, seek refuge here 
 of our o^vn will, which if we find, we must not disdain our hosts. 
 'Eemember, too, the easy rage of the fiery Scot; and that we 
 boast gentler customs : sufifer no brawling to mar our concord ; 
 let not Eichard of York, who of all his wide realm possesses 
 yoiir hearts only, find his dominions narrowed, or violently 
 disturbed by your petulance and pride." 
 
 The duke's"' associates listened with respect. Hitherto the 
 spirited boy had been led by a Barry, a CHfford, a Neville, or a 
 Plautagenet. They had counselled, spoken for him; his sword 
 only had been as active as theirs. A new light seemed to have 
 broken in upon his soul ; it assumed a seriousness and power 
 that exalted him in their eyes, while it took nothing from the 
 candour and sing] e-hearted"^ reliance on their loves, which was 
 his dearest charm. 
 
 On landing, the duke of York was escorted to Edinburgh by 
 the earl of Errol, Sir Patrick Hamilton, and others. The attire, 
 arms, and horses, with their caparisons, of these gentlemen, were 
 little inferior to those displayed at Paris. King James awaited 
 him at the castle of Edinburgh. The monarch received his 
 guest in state on his throne. The prince was struck at once by 
 his elegance, his majesty, and sweet animated aspect : his black 
 bonnet, looped up by a large ruby, sat lightly on his brow, his 
 glossy black curly hair escaping in ringlets from underneath ; 
 his embroidered shirt-collar, thrown back, displayed his throat, 
 and the noble expression of his head ; his dark grey eyes, his 
 manly sun-burnt complexion, the look of thought, combined 
 with goodness, mingled with dignity, gave an air of distinction 
 to his whole person. Various were the physiognomies, various 
 the guises, of those around him. The swart, gaunt Highlander, 
 in his singular costume ; the blue-eyed, red-haired sous of the 
 Lowlands were there ; and in each and all were remarkable a 
 martial, sometimes a ferocious, expression. 
 
 The prince of England entered, surrounded by his (to the 
 Scotch) foreign-looking knights. 
 
 James descended from his throne to embrace his visitant, and 
 then re-assumed it, while all eyes were turned upon the royal 
 adventurer, whose voice and mien won every heart, before his 
 eloquence had time to move them. " High and mighty king," 
 said Eichard, "your grace, and these your nobles present, be 
 pleased to hear the tragedy of one, who, born a prince, comes 
 even as a beggar to your court. My lords, sorrow and I were

 not twins : I am tlie elder, and for nine years I beheld not the 
 ill-visage of that latest birth of my poor but royal mother's 
 fortunes. It were a long tale to tell, what rumour has made 
 familiar to every ear: my uncle Gloucester's usurpation; my 
 brother's death; and the sorrows of our race. I lost my king-* 
 dom ere I possessed it ; and while jet my young hands were 
 too feeble to grasp the sceptre of my ancestors, and, with it, 
 the sword needful to defend the same, capricious fate bestowed 
 it on Henry of Richmond ; a base-born descendant of ill-nur- 
 tured Bolingbroke ; a scion of that Eed Rose that so long ana 
 so rightfully had been uprooted in the land, which they had 
 bought with its children's dearest blood. 
 
 " Good, my lords, I might move you to pity did I relate how, 
 in my tender years, that usurer king sought my life, buying the 
 the blood of the orphan at the hands of traitors. How, when 
 these cruelties failed him, he used subtler arts ; giving me nick- 
 names ; meeting my gallant arra}^ of partizaus, not with an army 
 of their peers, but with a base rout of deceits, treasons, spies, 
 and blood-stained decoyers. It would suit me better to excite 
 your admirations by speaking of the nobleness and fidelity of 
 my friends ; the generosity of the sovereigns who have shed 
 invaluable dews upon the fading White Rose, so to refresh and 
 restore it. 
 
 " But not to waste my tediousness on you, let this be the 
 sum. I am here, the friend of France, the kinsman of Bur- 
 gundy ; the acknowledged lord of Ireland ; pursued by my 
 powerful foe, I am here, king of Scotland, to claim your friend- 
 ship and your aid. Here lies the accomplishment of my des- 
 tiny ! The universal justice to be rendered me, which I dreamed 
 of in my childhood, the eagle hopes of my youth, my better 
 fortunes, and future greatness, have fled me. But here they 
 have found a home ; here they are garnered up ; render them 
 back to me, my lord ; unlock with the iron key of fatal battle 
 the entrance to those treasures, all mine own, whose absence 
 renders me so poor. Arm for me Scotland ; arm for the right ! 
 Never for a juster cause could you buckle breast-plate, or poize 
 your lance. Be my captain, and these ypur peers, my fellow- 
 soldiers. Fear not, but that we vanquish ; that I gain a king- 
 dom ; you eternal glory from your regal gift. Alas ! I am as 
 a helmless vessel drifting towards the murderous rock ; but 
 you, as the strong north-wind, may fill the flapping sails, 
 and carry me on my way with victory and gladness."

 his sword ; Hamilton's eyes glanced lightnings ; not one there 
 but felt his heart beat with desire to enforce the illustrious

 exile's riglit. The tide of risinn^ enthusiasm paused as James 
 arose ; and deep attention held them all. He descended from 
 his throne. "My royal brother," he said, "were I a mere 
 errant knight, so good and high I esteem your cause, without 
 more ado 1 would don my armour, and betake me to the field. 
 The same power which enables me to afford you far better 
 succour than the strength of one arm, obliges me to pause and 
 take council, ere I speak what it is in my heart to promise. But 
 your highness has made good your interests among my coun- 
 sellors ; and I read in their gestures the desire of war and 
 adventure for your sake. Deem yourself an exile no more. 
 Fancy that you have come from merry England to feast with 
 your brother in the north, and we will escort you back to your 
 'capital in triumphant procession, showing the gaping world how 
 slighter than silky cobwebs are the obstacles that oppose the 
 united strength of Plantagenet and Stuart. Welcome — thrice 
 welcome to the Scottish land — kinsmen, nobles, valiant gentle- 
 men, bid dear welcome to my brother England ! "

 A FEW days made it apparent that York acquired a stronger 
 power over the generous and amiable king of Scotland, than 
 could be given by motives of state policy. • He became his 
 friend ; no empty name with James, whose ardent soul poured 
 itself headlong into this new channel, and revelled in a kind of 
 ecstasy in the virtues and accomplishments of his favoured 
 guest. Both these princes were magnanimous and honourable, 
 full of grandeur of purpose, and gentleness of manner ; united 
 by these main qualities, the diversities of their dispositions 
 served rather to draw them closer. Though Richard's adven- 
 tures and disasters had been so many, his countenance, his

 very mind was less careworn tlian tliat of James. The "White 
 Eose, even in adversity, was the niirslin;^ of love ; the Scottish 
 prince, in his palace -fostered childhood, had been the object 
 of his father's hatred and suspicion : cabal, violence, and du- 
 plicity had waited on him. James governed those around him 
 by demonstrating to them, that it was their interest to obey 
 a watchful, loving, generous monarch : Richard's power was 
 addressed to the most exalted emotions of the human heart, 
 to the fidelity, self-devotion, and chivalric attachment of his 
 adherents. James drew towards himself the confidence of 
 men ; Richard bestowed his own upon them. James vras 
 winning from his courtesy, Eichard from his ingenuousness. 
 Eemorse had printed a fadeless stamp of thought and pain on 
 the king's countenance ; an internal self-communion and self- 
 rebuke were seated in the deep shadows of his thoughtful eyes. 
 Richard's sorrow for the disasters he might be said to have 
 occasioned his friends, his disdain of his own vagabond position, 
 his sadness when his winged thoughts flew after the Adalid, 
 to hover over his sweet Monina ; all these emotions were 
 tinged by respect for the virtues of those around him, con- 
 scious rectitude, pious resignation to Providence, gratitude to 
 his friends, and a tender admiration of the virgin virtues of her 
 he loved : so that there arose thence only a softer expression 
 for his features, a sweetness in the candour of his smile, a gentle 
 fascination in his frank address, that gave at once the stamp 
 of elevated feeling and goodness to his mien. He looked inno- 
 cent, while James's aspect gave token, that in his heart good 
 and ill had waged war : the better side had conquered, yet had 
 not come off scathless from the fight. 
 
 In the first enthusiasm of his new attachment, James was 
 eager to lavish on his friend every mark of his favour and 
 interest ; he was obliged to check his impatience, and to submit 
 to the neccssitv of consulting with and deferring to others. His 
 promises, though large, continued therefore to be vague ; and 
 York knew that he had several enemies at the council-board. 
 The intimacy between him and the king prevented him from 
 entertaining any doubts as to the result; but he had a dilTicult 
 task in communicating this spirit of patient forbearance to his 
 friends. Sometimes they took sudden fright, lest they should 
 all at once meet a denial to their desires ; sometimes they were 
 indignant at the delays that were interposed. None was more 
 open in his expressions of discontent than Master Secretary 
 Frion. He ^vho had been the soul of every enterprise until 
 now, who had fancied that his talents for negotiation would be 
 of infinite avail in the Scottish coui-t. found that the friendship

 "between the princes, and Hicliard's disdain of artfully enticiuj^ 
 to Lis side his host's noble subjects, destroyed at once his 
 diplomatic weaving. He craftily incrcEised the discontent of 
 the proud Keville, the disquietude of the zealous Lady Bramp- 
 ton, and the turbulent intolerance of repose of Lord Barry ; 
 while Hichard, on the other hand, exerted himself to tranquillize 
 and reduce them to reason : he was sanf^uine in his expecta- 
 tions, and above all, confident in his friend's sincere intention to 
 do more than merely assist him by force of arms. He saw a 
 thousand projects at work in James's generous heart, every one 
 tending to exalt him in the eyes of the world, and to rescue 
 him for ever from the nameless, fugitive position he occupied. 
 JN^or was his constant intercourse with the king of small influ- 
 ence over his happiness ; the genius, the versatile talents, the 
 grace and accomplishments of this sovereign, the equality and 
 sympathy that reigned between them, was an exhaustlcss source 
 of more than amusement, of interest and delight. The friends 
 of James became his friends : Sir Patrick Hamilton was chief 
 among these, and warmly attached to the English prince : 
 another, whom at first ceremony had placed at a greater distance 
 from him, grew into an object of intense interest and continual 
 excitation. 
 
 " This evening," said the king to him, soon after his arrival, 
 "you will see the flower of our Scottish damsels, the flower of 
 the world well may I call her ; for assuredly, when you see the 
 Lady Katherine Gordon, you will allow that she is matchless 
 
 among women." 
 
 Eichard was surprised : did James's devotion to Lady Jane 
 Kennedy, nay, his conscious look whenever he mentioned her, 
 mean nothing ? Besides, on this appeal to his own judgment, he 
 pictured his soft-eyed Spaniard, with all her vivacity and all her 
 tenderness, and he revolted from the idea of being the slave of 
 any other beauty. " Speak to our guest, Sir Patrick," continued 
 the king, "and describe the fair earthly a,ngel who makes a 
 heaven of our bleak wilds ; or rather, for his highness might 
 suspect you, let me, not her lover, but her cousin, her admirer, 
 her friend, tell half the charms, half the virtues of the daughter 
 of Huntley. Is it not strange that I, who have seen her each day 
 since childhood, and who still gaze with wonder on her beaut}', 
 should 3^et find that words fail me when I would paint itP I 
 am apt to see, and ready to praise, the delicate arch of this lady's 
 brow, the fire of another's eyes, another's pouting lip and fair 
 complexion, the gay animation of one, the chiselled symmetry 
 of a second. Often, when our dear Lady Kate has sat, as is often 
 her wont, retired from sight, conversing with some travelled

 greybeard, or pajang the homage of attention to some ancient 
 dame (of late I have remarked her often in discourse with Lady 
 Brampton), I have studied her face and person to dscover where 
 the overpowering charm exists, which, like a strain of impassioned 
 music, electrifies the senses, and touches the hearts of all near 
 her. Is it in her eyes ? A poet might dream of dark blue orbs 
 like hers, and that he had kissed eyelids soft as those, when he 
 came unawares on the repose of young Aurora, and go mad for 
 ever after, because it was only a dream: yet I have seen brighter; 
 nor are they languishing. Her lips, yes, the soul of beauty is 
 there, and so is it in her dimpled chin. In the delicate rounding 
 of her cheeks, and the swanlike loveliness of her throat, in the 
 soft ringlets of her glossy hair, down to the very tips of her 
 roseate-tinged fingers, there is proportion, expression, and grace. 
 You will hardly see all this : at first you will be struck ; extreme 
 beauty must strike ; but your second thought will be, to wonder 
 what struck you, and then you will look around, and see twenty 
 prettier and more attractive ; and then, why, at the first words 
 she speaks, you will fancy it an easy thing to die upon the mere 
 thought of her : her voice alone will take you out of yourself, and 
 carry you into another state of being. She is simple as a child, 
 straightforward, direct : falsehood — pah ! Katherine is Truth. 
 This simplicity, which knows neither colouring nor deviation, 
 might almost make you fear, while you adore her, but that her 
 goodness brings you back to love. She is good, almost beyond the 
 consc-iousness of being so : she is good because she gives herself 
 entirely up to sympathy ; and, beyond every other, she dives 
 into the sources of your pleasures and pains, and takes a part in 
 them. The better part of yourself will, when she speaks, appear 
 to leap out, as if, for the first time, it found its other half ; while 
 the worse is mute, like a stricken dog, before her. She is gay, 
 more eager to create pleasure than to please ; for to please, we 
 must think of ourselves, and be ourselves the hero of the story, 
 and Katherine is ever forgetful of self: she is guileless and gall- 
 less ; all love her ; her proud father, and fiery, contentious 
 Highland brothers, defer to her; yet, to look at her, it is as if 
 the youngest and most innocent of the graces read a page of 
 wisdom's book, scarce understanding what it meant, but feeling 
 that it was right." 
 
 It was dangerous to provoke the spirit of criticism by excessive 
 praise ; Eichard felt half inclined to assert that there was some- 
 thing in the style of the king's painting that showed he should 
 not like this lauded lady ; but she was his cousin, he was proud 
 of her, and so he was silent. There was a ball at court that 
 night ; and he would see many he had never seen before j James

 made it a point tliat lie should discover wliicli was his cousin. 
 He could not mistake. " She is loveliness itself!" burst from 
 his lips ; and from that moment he felt what James had said, 
 that there was a " music breathing from her face," an unearthly, 
 spirit-stirring beauty, that inspired awe, had not her perfect 
 want of pretension, her quite, unassuming simplicity, at once led 
 him back to every thought associated with the charms and virtues 
 of woman. Lady Brampton was already a link between them ; 
 and, in a few minutes, he found himself conversing with more 
 unreserve and pleasure than he had ever done. There are two 
 pleasures in our intercourse in society, one is to listen, another 
 to speak. We may frequently meet agreeable, entertaining 
 people, and even sometimes individuals, whose conversation, 
 either by its wit, its profundity, or its variety, commands our 
 whole rapt attention : but very seldem during the course of our 
 lives do we meet those who tliaw every lingering particle of ice, 
 who set the warm life-springs flowing, and entice us, with our 
 hearts upon our lips, to give utterance to its most secret mys- 
 teries ; to disentangle every knot and fold of thought, and, like 
 sea-weed in the wave, to spread the disregarded herbage, as a 
 tracery matchlessly fair before another's eyes. Such pleasure 
 Eichard felt with Eatherine ; and, ever and anon, her melodious 
 voice interposed with some remark, some explanation of his own 
 feelings, at once brilliant and true. 
 
 Eichard knew that Sir Patrick Hamilton loved the Lady Eath- 
 erine Gordon; he also was related to the royal family. Hamilton, 
 in the eyes of all, fair ladies and sage counsellors, was acknow- 
 ledged to be the most perfect knight of Scotland ; what obstacle 
 could there be to their union ? Probably it was already projected, 
 and acceded to. Eichard did not derogate from the faiih that 
 he told himself he owed to Monina, by cultivating a friend- 
 ship for the promised bride of another, and moreover one whom, 
 after the interval of a few short months, he would never see 
 again. Satisfied with this reasoning, York lost no opportunity 
 of devoting himself to the Lady Katherine. 
 
 His interests were the contmual subject of discussion in the 
 royal counsel-chamber. There were a few who did not speak in 
 his favour. The principal of these was the earl of Moray, the 
 king's uncle: the least in consideration, for he was not of the 
 council, though he influenced it : but the bitterest in feeling, was 
 Sir John Earascy, laird of Balmayne, who styled himself Lord 
 Bothwell. He had been a favourite of James the Third. His 
 dark, fierce temper was exasperated by his master's death, and 
 he brooded perpetually for revenge. He had once, with several 
 other nobles, entered into a conspiracy to deliver up the present

 ]i\r](T to Ilcnry tlic Sevenlh ; and tlic traitorous intent was 
 defeated, not from vrant of will, but want of povrer in bis abettors. 
 Since tlien, Lord Bothwell, tlioutrh nominally banished and 
 attainted, was suffered to live in Edinburgh, nay, to have access 
 to the royal person. James, whose conscience suffered so dearly 
 by the death of his father, had no desire to display severity 
 towards his ancient faithful servant; besides, one who was really 
 so insignificant as Sir John Ramsey. This man was turbulent, 
 dissatisfied : he was sold to Henry of England, and had long 
 acted as a spy; the appearance of York at Edinburgh gave 
 activity and importance to his function: his secret influence and 
 covert intrigues retarded somewhat the projects and desires of 
 the king. 
 
 AVlien the first opposition madeto acknowledging this pretender 
 to the l^iiglish crown was set aside, other diiSculties ensued. 
 Some of the counsellors were for making hard conditions with 
 the young duke, saying, that half a kingdom were gift enougli to 
 a Prince Lackland: a golden opportunity was this, they averred, 
 to slice away a bonny county or two from wide England ; he 
 whom they gifted with the rest could hardly say them nay. But 
 James was indignant at the base proposal, and felt mortified and 
 vexed when obfiged to concede in part, and to make conditions 
 which he thought hard with his guest. After a noisy debate, 
 these propositions were drawn out, and York was invited 
 to attend the council, where they were submitted for his 
 assent. 
 
 These conditions principally consisted in the surrender of 
 Berwick, and the promised payment of one hundred thousand 
 marks. They were hard ; for it would touch the new monarch's 
 honour not to dismember his kingdom ; and it were his policy 
 not to burden himself with a debt which his already, oppressed 
 subjects must be drawn on to pay. The duke asked for a day 
 for consideration, which was readily granted. 
 
 With real zeal for his cause on one side, and perfect conlidence 
 in his friends' inte^ritv on the other, these diificullies became 
 merely nominal, and the treaty was speedily arranged. But the 
 month of September was near its close ; a winter campaign would 
 be of small avail : monc)'', arms, and trained men, were wanting. 
 The winter was to be devoted to preparation ; with the spring 
 the Scottisli army was to pass the English border. In every 
 discussion, in every- act, James acted as his guest's brother, the 
 sharer of his risks and fortunes : one will, one desire, was theirs. 
 Sir Patrick Hamilton went into the west to raise levies : no, 
 third person interposed between them. It was the king's dispo- 
 sition to yield himself wholly up to the passion of the hour,. He

 saw in IvicLnrd, not only a prince deprived of his own, and driven 
 into exile, but a youth of royal lineage, exposed to the oppro- 
 bium of nick-names and the accusation of imposture. The kin^r 
 of France acknowledired, but he had deserted him : the archduke 
 had done the same : how could James prove that he would not 
 follow in these steps ? He levied the armies of his kingdom in 
 his favour ; he was to fight and conquer for him next spring. 
 The intervening months were intolerable to the fervent spirit of 
 the Stuart — something speedy, something now, he longed, he 
 resolved to do ; which, with a trumpet-note, should to all corners 
 of the world declare, that he upheld Eichard of York's right — • 
 that he was his defender, his champion. Once he penned a 
 universal challenge, then another especially addressed to Henry 
 Tudor ; but his invasion were a better mode than this. Should 
 he give him rank in Scotland ? — that would ill beseem one who 
 aspired to the English crown. Should he proclaim him Eichard 
 the Fourth in Edinburgh? — York strongly objected to this. 
 Money ? — it were a base gilding ; besides, James was very poor, 
 and had melted down his plate, and put his jewels to pawn, 
 to furnish forth the intended expedition. Yet there was one 
 way, — the idea was as lightning — James felt satisfied and proud; 
 and then devoted all his sagacity, all his influence, all his ardent 
 soul, to the accomplishment of a plan, which, while it insured 
 young Kichard's happiness, stamped him indelibly as being no 
 vagabond impostor, but the honoured prince, the kinsman and 
 ally of Scotland's royal house. 
 
 King James and the duke of York had ridden out to inspect a 
 Lowland regiment, which the earl of Angus proudly displayed as 
 the force of the Douglas. As they returned, James was melan- 
 choly and meditative. "It is strange and hard to endure," he 
 said at last, fixing on his companion his eyes at once so full of 
 fire and thought, " when two spirits contend within the little 
 microcosm of man. I felt joy at sight of those bold followers of 
 the Douglas, to think that your enemy could not resist them ; 
 but I do myself foolish service, when I place you on the English 
 throne. You will leave us, my lord : you will learn in your 
 bonny realm to despise our barren wilds : it will be irksome 
 to you in prosperity, to think of your friends of the dark hour." 
 
 There was sincerity in these expressions, but exaggeration in 
 the feelings that dictated them. Eichard felt half-embarrassed, 
 in spite of gratitude and friendship. The king, following the 
 bent of his own thoughts, not those of others, suddenly con- 
 tinued : " Our cousin Kate at last, finds grace in your eyes ; 
 is she not good and beautiful, all cold and passionless as 
 she is ? "

 " Cold ! " tlie Lady Katlierine, wliose heartfelt sympathy, was 
 a sunny clime in which he basked — whose sensibility perpetually 
 varied the bright expression of her features — York repeated the 
 word in astonishment. 
 
 " Thou flndest her wax ? " inquired James, smiling ; " by my 
 troth, she has proved but marble before." 
 
 " I cannot guess even at your meaning," replied York, with all 
 the warmth of a champion ; " tlie lady is in the estimation of all, 
 in your own account, the best daughter, the most devoted friend, 
 the kindest mistress in the world. How can we call that spirit 
 cold, which animates her to these acts ? It is not easy to per- 
 form, as she does, our simplest duties. How much of self-will, 
 of engrossing humour, even of our innocent desires and cherished 
 tastes, must we not sacrifice, when we devote ourselves to the 
 pleasure and service of others ? How much attention does it not 
 require, how sleepless a feeling of interest, merely to perceive 
 and understand the moods and wishes of those around us ! An 
 inert, sluggish nature, half ice, half rock, cannot do this. To 
 achieve it, as m.ethinks your fair kinswoman does, requires all 
 her understanding, all her sweetness, all that exquisite tact and 
 penetrative feeling I never saw but in her." 
 
 "I am glad you say this," said James. "Y"es, Xate has a 
 warm heart : none has a better right to say so than I. There are 
 — there were times, for the gloom of the dark hour is somewhat 
 mitigated^ — when no priest, no penance, had such power over me 
 as my cousin liatherine's sweet voice. Like a witch she dived 
 into the recesses of my heart, plucking thence my unholy distrust 
 in God's mercy. By St. Andrew ! when I look at her, all simple 
 and gentle as she is, I wonder in what part of her resides the 
 wisdom and the eloquence I have heard fall from her lips ; nor 
 have I had the heart to reprove her, when I have been angered 
 to see our cousin Sir Patrick driven mad by her sugared 
 courtesies." 
 
 " Does she not affect Sir Patrick? " asked Eichard, while he 
 wondered at the thrilling sensation of fear that accompanied his 
 words. 
 
 *' 'Yea, heartily,' she will reply," replied the king ; " 'Would 
 you have me disdain our kinsman ? ' she asks when I rail ; 
 but you, who are of gender masculine, though, by the mass ! 
 a smooth specimen of our rough kind, know full well that pride 
 and impertinence are better than equable, smiling, impenetrable 
 sweetness. Did the lady of my love treat me thus, 'sdeath, 
 I think I should order myself the rack for pastime. But we 
 forget ourselves ; push on, dear prince. It is the hour, when the 
 hawks and their fair mistresses are to meet us on the hill's side.

 I serve no sucli glassy damsel ; nor would I tliat little Kennedy's 
 eye darted fires on me in scorn of ray delay. Are not my pretty 
 Lady Jane's eyes bright, Sir Duke ? " 
 
 *' As a fire-fly among dark-leaved myrtles." 
 
 " Or a de^-drop on the heather, -when the morning sun glances 
 on it, as we take our mountain morning-way to the chase. You 
 look grave, my friend ; surely her eyes are nought save as 
 nature's miracle to you ? " 
 
 *' Assuredly not," replied York ; ** are they other to your 
 majesty — you do not love the lady ? " 
 
 " Oh, no ! " reiterated James, with a meaning glance, " I do 
 not love the Lady Jane ; only I would bathe in fire, bask in ice, 
 do each and every impossibility woman's caprice could frame 
 for trials to gain — but I talk wildly to a youthful sage. Say, 
 most revered anchorite, wherefore doubt you my love to my 
 pretty mistress ? " 
 
 "Love ! " exclaimed Eichard ; his eyes grew lustrous in their 
 own soft dew as he spoke. *' Oh, what profanation is this ! And 
 this you think is love ! to select a young, innocent, and beauteous 
 girl — who, did she wed her equal, would become an honoured 
 wife and happy mother — to select her, the more entirely to 
 deprive her of these blessings — to bar her out for ever from a 
 woman's paradise, a happy home ; you, who even now are in 
 treaty for a princess-bride, would entice this young thing to give 
 up her heart, her all, into your hands, who will crush it, as boys 
 a gaudy butterfly, when the chase is over. Dear my lord, spare 
 her the pain — yourself remorse ; you are too good, too wise, too 
 generous, to commit this deed and not to suflTer bitterly," 
 
 A cloud came over James's features. The very word " remorse" 
 was a sound of terror to him. He smote his right hand against 
 his side, where dwelt his heart, in sore neighbourhood to the 
 iron of his penance. 
 
 At this moment, sweeping down the near hill-side, came a 
 gallant array of ladies and courtiers. The king even lagged 
 behind ; when near, he accosted Katherine, he spoke to the earl 
 of Angus, to Mary Boyd, to all save the Lady Jane, who first 
 looked disdainful, then hurt, and, at last, unable to straggle 
 with her pain, rode sorrowfully apart. James tried to see, to 
 feel nothing. Her pride he resisted, her anger he strove to 
 contemn, her dejection he could not endure : and, when riding 
 up to her unaware, he saw the traces of tears on her cheek, 
 usually so sunny bright with smiles, he forgot everything save 
 his wish to console, to mollify, to cheer her. As they returned, 
 his hand was on her saddle-bow, his head bent down, his eyes 
 looking into hers, and she was smiling, though less gay than

 usual. From that hour James less coveted the prince's society. 
 He beojan a little to fear him : not the less did he love and 
 esteem him ; and more, far more, did he deem him worthy of the 
 honour, the happiness he intended to bestow upon him.

 The threads were spun, warp and woof laid on, and Fate busily 
 . took up the shuttle, which was to entwine the histories of two 
 beings, at whose birth pomp and royalty stood sponsors, whose 
 career was marked by every circumstance that least accorded 
 with such a nativity. A thousand obstacles stood in the way ; 
 the king, with all his fervour, hesitated before he proposed to 
 the earl of Huntley to bestow his daughter, of whom he was 
 justly proud, on a fugitive sovereign, without a kingdom, almost 
 without a name. Fortune, superstition, ten thousand of those 
 imperceptible threads which fate uses when she weaves her most 
 indissoluble webs, all served to bring about the apparently 
 impossible. 
 
 The earl of Huntley was a man of a plain, straightforward, 
 resolved ambition. His head was warm, his heart cold, his 
 purpose one — to advance his house, and himself at the head of 
 it, to as high a situation as the position of subject would permit. 
 In the rebellion which occasioned the death of James the Third, 
 he had vacillated, unable quite to ascertain which party would 
 prove triumphant ; and when the rebels, rebels then no more, but 
 lieges to James the Fourth, won the day, they looked coldly on 
 their lukewarm partizan. Huntley grew discontented : though 
 Btill permitted to hold the baton of Earl Marshal, he saw a cloud 
 of royal disfavour darkening his fortunes ; in high indignation he 
 joined in the nefarious plot of Buchan, Bothwell; and Sir Thomas

 Todd, to deliver his sovereign into the hands of Henry of 
 England, a project after vrards abandoned. 
 
 Time had softened the bitter animosities which attended 
 James at the beginning of his reign. He extended his favour to 
 all parties, and reconciled them to each other. A wonder it was, 
 to see the Douglases, Hamiltous, Gordons, Homes, the Murrays, 
 and Lennoxes, and a thousand others, at peace with each other, 
 and obedient to their sovereign. The earl of Huntley, a man 
 advanced in life, prudent, resolute, and politic, grew into favour. 
 He was among the principal of the Scottish peers ; he had sons, 
 to vrhom the honours of his race would descend, and this one 
 daughter, whom he loved as vrell as he could love anything, and 
 respected from the extent of her influence, and the perfect pru- 
 dence of her conduct ; she was his friend and counsellor, the 
 mediator between him and her brothers ; the kind mistress to his 
 vassals, a gentle, but all-powerful link between him and his king, 
 whose value he duly appreciated. 
 
 Her marriage was often the subject of his meditation. Super- 
 stition was ever rife in Scotland. James the Third had driven 
 all his brothers from him, because he had been told to beware of 
 one near of kin ; and his death, of which his sou was the osten- 
 sible agent, fulfilled the prophecy. Second-sight, in the High- 
 lands, was of more avail than the predictions of a Lowland sibyl. 
 The seer of the house of Gordon had, on the day of her birth, 
 seen the Lady Katherine receive homage as a queen, and standing 
 at the altar with one, ou whose young brow he perceived, all dim 
 and shadowy, " the likeness of a kingly "crown." True, this eleva- 
 tion vras succeeded by disasters : he had beheld her a fugitive j 
 he saw her stand on the brow of a cliff that overlooked the sea, 
 while the wild clouds careered over the pale moon, alone, de- 
 serted ; he saw her a prisoner ; he saw her stand desolate beside 
 the corpse of him she had wedded— the diadem was still there, 
 dimly seen amid the disarray of his golden curls. These images 
 haunted the earl's imagination, and made him turn a slighting 
 ear to Sir Patrick Hamilton, and other noble suitors of his lovely 
 child. Sometimes he thought of the king, her cousin, or one of 
 his brothers: flight, desolation, and death, were no strange 
 attendants on the state of the king of Scotland, and these 
 miseries he regarded as necessary and predestined ; he could not 
 avert, and so he hardly regarded them, while his proud bosom 
 swelled at the anticipation of the thorny diadem, which was to 
 press the brow of a daughter of the Gordon. 
 
 Lord Huntley had looked coldly on the English prince. Lord 
 Bothwell, as he called himself, otherwise Sir John Eamsay, of 
 Balmayne, his former accomplice, tampered with him ou the part

 of Henry tlie Seventh, to induce Lira to oppose warmly tlie 
 reception of this " feigned boy," and to negative every proposi- 
 tion to advance his claims. King Henry's urgent letters, and 
 Hamsay's zeal, awakened the earl's suspicions ; a manifest im- 
 postor could hardly engender such fears, such hate ; and, when 
 midnight assassination, or the poisoned bowl, were plainly hinted 
 at by the monarch of wide England, Huntley felt assured that 
 the enemy he so bitterly pursued was no pretender, but the 
 rightful heir of the sceptre Henry held. He did not quite refuse 
 to join with Bothwell, especially when he heard that he was 
 listened to by the bishop of Moray and the earl of Buchan ; but 
 involuntarily he assumed a different language with regard to 
 York, became more respectful to him, and by his demeanour 
 crushed at once the little party who had hitherto spokeu of him 
 with contempt. The king perceived this change ; it was the 
 foundation-stone of his project. " Tell me, you who are wise, 
 my lord," said the monarch to his earl marshal, "how I may 
 raise our English prince in the eyes of Scotland. We fight for 
 him in the spring — for him, we say — but few of ours echo the 
 word ; they disdain to fight for any not akin to them." 
 
 *' They would fight for the Foul Fiend," said Huntley, " whom 
 they would be ill-pleased to call cousin, if he led them over the 
 English border." 
 
 " Ay, if he took them there to foray ; but the duke of York 
 will look on England as his own, and when the nobles of the 
 land gather round him, it will be chauncy work to keep them 
 and our Scots from shedding each other's blood ; they would 
 spill Duke Eichard's like water, if uo drop of it can be deemed 
 Scotch." 
 
 "It were giving him a new father and mother," replied the 
 earl, " to call him thus." 
 
 " When two even of hostile houses intermarry, our heralds 
 pale their arms ; the offspring pale their blood." 
 
 " But what Scottish lady would your grace bestow on him 
 whose rank were a match for royalty ? There is no princess of 
 the Stuarts." 
 
 "And were there," asked James, quickly, "would it beseem 
 us to bestow our sister on a King Lackland?" 
 
 "Or would your majesty wait till he were king of England, 
 when France, Burgundy, and Spain would compete with you? I 
 do believe that this noble gentleman has fair right to his father's 
 crown ; he is gallant and generous, so is not King Henry ; he 
 is mnde to be the idol of a warlike people, such as the English, 
 so is not his rival'. Do you strike one stroke, the whole realm 
 rises for him, and he becomes its sovereign : then it were a pride

 and a glory for ns, for liim a tie to bind liim for ever, did he 
 place his diadem on the head of a Scottish damseh" 
 
 " You are sanguine and speak warmly," replied ' the king : 
 " see you beyond your own words ? to me they suggest a thought 
 which I entertain, or not, as is your pleasure : there is but one 
 lady in our kingdom fitting mate for him, and she is more 
 Gordon than Stuart. Did your lordship glance at the Lady 
 Catherine in your speech P " 
 
 Lord Huntley changed colour : a sudden rush of thought 
 palsied the beatings of his heart. Was he called upon to give 
 his child, his throne-destined daughter, to this king-errant? 
 Kay, nay, thus did fortune blindly work ; her hand would insure 
 to him the crown, and so fulfil to her the dark meaning of the 
 seer : hesitating, lost to his wonted presence of mind, Huntley 
 could only find words to ask for a day for reflection. James 
 wondered at this show of emotion ; he could not read its full 
 meaning : " At your pleasure, my lord," he said, " but if you 
 decide against my "honoured, royal friend, remember that this 
 question dies without record — you will preserve our secret." 
 
 Every reflection that could most disquiet an ambitious man 
 possessed the earl marshal. That his daughter should be queen 
 of England was beyond his hopes ; that she should be the errant 
 wife of a pretender, who passed his life in seeking ineffectual aid 
 at foreign courts, was far beneath them. He canvassed every 
 likelihood of York's success ; now they dwindled like summer- 
 snow on the southern mountain's side — now they strode high 
 and triumphant over every obstacle ; the clinging feeling was — 
 destiny had decreed it — she being his wife, both would succeed 
 and reign. " There is fate in it," was his last reflection, " and I 
 will not gainsay the fulfilment. Andrew of the Shawe was the 
 prince of seers, as I have good proof. Still to a monarch alone 
 shall she give her hand, and I must make one condition." 
 
 This one condition Lord Huntley communicated to his royal 
 master. It was that York should, as of right lie might, assume 
 the style and title of king. James smiled at his earl marshal's 
 childish love of gauds, and did not doubt that the duke would 
 pay so easy price for a jewel invaluable as Catherine. But 
 granting this, the king, knowing the noble's despotic character, 
 required one condition also on his part, that he should first 
 announce the intended union to the lady, and that it should not 
 have place without her free and entire consent. Huntley was 
 surprised : " Surely, my liege," he began, " if your majesty and 
 I command " 
 
 ** Our sweet Kate will obey," interrupted James ; " but this 
 is no mere marriage of policy ; hazards, fearful hazards may

 attend it. Did I not believe that all would end well, by tbe 
 Holy Rood he should not have her ; but she may see things with 
 different eyes — slie may shrink from becomincj the wife of an 
 exile, a wanderer without a home : yet that need never be." 
 
 York little guessed the projects of his royal friend. Love, in 
 its most subtle guise, had insinuated itself into his soul, becoming 
 a very portion of himself. That part of our nature, which to our 
 reflections appears the most human, and yet which forms the 
 best part of humanity, is our desire of sympathy ; the intense 
 essence of sympathy is love. Love has been called selfish, 
 engrossing, tyrannic — as the root, so the green leaf that shoots 
 from it — love is a part of us — it is our manifestation of life ; 
 and poisonous or sweet will be the foliage, according to the 
 stock. When we love, it is our aim and conclusion to make the 
 cbject a part of ourselves — if we are self-willed and evilly in- 
 clined, little good can arise ; but deep is the fount of generous, 
 devoted, godlike feeling, which this silver key unlocks in gentle 
 hearts. Kichard had found in the Lady Catherine a magic 
 mirror, which gave him back himself, arrayed with a thousand 
 alien virtues ; his soul was in her hands, plastic to her fairy 
 touch, and tenderness and worship and wonder took his heart, 
 ere passion woke, and threw a chain over these bosom guests, so 
 that they could never depart. A mild, yet golden light dawned 
 upon his soul, and beamed from it, lighting up creation with 
 splendour — filling his mind with mute, yet entrancing melody. 
 He walked in a dream ; but fcir from being rendered by his 
 abstraction morose or inattentive to others, never had he been 
 so gay, never so considerate and amiable. He felt that, beneath 
 the surface of his life, there was the calm and even the bliss of 
 Paradise ; and his lightest word or act must be, by its grace and 
 benevolence, in concord with the tranquil spirit that brooded 
 over his deeper-hidden self. All loved him the better for the 
 change, save Frion ; there was something in him that the wily 
 Frenchman did not understand ; he went about and about, but 
 how could this man of " low-thoughted care" understand the 
 holy mysteries of love. 
 
 Katherine accompanied her father to Gordon Castle, in Aber- 
 deenshire. Where was the light now, that had made a summer 
 noon in Richard's soul ? There was memory : it brought before 
 him her cherub-face, her voice, the hours when at her side lie had 
 poured out his overbrimming soul in talk — not of love, but of 
 ideas, feelings, imaginations he had never spoken before. Two 
 days passed, and by that time he had collected a whole volume of 
 things he wished to say — and she was far : then hope claimed 
 entrance to his heart, and with her came a train he dreamt not

THE MAREIAGE. 231 
 
 of — of fears, anticipations, terror, despair ; and then a tenfold 
 ardour for his enterprise. Should he not win Katherine and a 
 kino^dom ? 
 
 On the third day after her departure, King James informed 
 the prince, that Lord Huntley had invited them to visit him at 
 his castle, " Will your grace venture," he asked, " so far into 
 the frozen circles of the icy north ? You will traverse many a 
 savage defile and wild mountain-top ; torrents and dark pine 
 forests bar the way, and barrenness spreads her hag's arms to 
 scare the intruder. I speak your language, the effeminate 
 language of an Andalusian, who loves the craggy heights, only 
 when summer basks upon them ; and the deep sunless dell, when 
 myrtles and geranium impregnate the air with sweets. I love 
 the mist and snow, the tameless winds and howling torrent, the 
 bleak unadorned precipice, the giant pines where the north makes 
 music. The grassy upland and the corn-field, these belong to 
 man, and to her they call Nature, the fair, gaudy dame ; but 
 God takes to himself, and lives among, these sublime rocks, 
 where power, majesty and eternity are shaped forth, and the 
 grandeur of heaven-piercing cliffs allies us to a simple but 
 elevating image of the Creator." 
 
 King James was a poet, and could feel thus — York might 
 smile at liis enthusiasm for the bleak and horrific. But had the 
 path to Gordon Castle been ten times more frightful, the thoughts 
 of love were roses, the hopes of love vernal breezes, to adorn it 
 with beauty. " Say, my lord," continued James, " sliall we go 
 throwing aside the cumbrous burthen of pomp? We are here 
 in Perth. Yonder, over those peaks, lies our direct path. Shall 
 we, two woodland rovers, with bows in our hand and quivers at 
 our back, take our solitary way through the wild region ? It is 
 my pastime ofttimes so to do ; and well I know the path that 
 leads me to the abode of my cousin Kate. We will send our 
 attendants by the easier path to the eastern sea-shore, at once 
 to announce our approach, and bear such gear as we may need, 
 not to play too humble a part in Huntley's eyes." 
 
 A thousand motives of policy and pride had induced the earl 
 to desire that tlais marriage should be celebrated in the High- 
 lands. Here he would appear almost a sovereign to his royal 
 son-in-law ; here also he should avoid the sarcasms of the Tudor 
 party, and the anger of those who had pretended to fair Kathe- 
 rine's hand. James consented to his wish, and now led his 
 friend and guest, through the very heart of his craggy kingdom 
 over the Grampians, towards Aberdeen. It was the end of 
 October ; a few sweet autumnal days still lingered among these 
 northern, hills, as if to light on their way the last feathered

 migrators hastening towards the south ; but dark mists invested 
 their morning progress. The rivers were swollen ; and the 
 mountain peaks often saluted the rising sun, garmented in 
 radiant snow. It was a little drear, yet grand, sublime, 
 wondrous. York suppressed his chilling distaste, till it grew 
 into admiration ; the king played the guide featly ; and the 
 honoured name of the Bruce, which peopled this region with 
 proud memories, was the burthen of many a tale ; nor was his 
 account of the fierce people of these wilds unwelcome to a 
 warrior. York remarked that the king was generally known to 
 them, not, indeed, as a monarch, but as a hunter, a traveller, 
 sometimes as a skilful mediciner, or as a bard, and always 
 hospitably received. 
 
 After three days they drew near their journey's end : curiosity 
 as fo the cause of their visit, anxiety concerning his reception, 
 all faded in Kichard's heart ; dimmed by the glad expectation 
 of seeing her again, who had dawned the glowing orient of his 
 darkened heart. They had departed from their rude shelter 
 before the sun rose : the mountain peaks were awake with day, 
 wliile night still slumbered in the plain below : some natural 
 sights speak to the heart more than others, wherefore we know 
 not : the most eloquent is that of the birth of day on the 
 untrodden hill-tops, while we, who behold it, are encompassed 
 by shadows. York paused : the scene appeared to close in on 
 him, and to fill him, even to overflowing, with its imagery. 
 They were toiling up the mountain's side : below, above, the dark 
 pines, in many a tortuous shape, clung to the rifted rocks ; the 
 fern clustered round some solitary old oak ; while, beetling over, 
 were dark frowning crags, or the foldings of the mountains, 
 softened into upland, painted by the many coloured heather. 
 With the steady pace of a mountaineer, King James breasted 
 the hill-side ; nor did York bely his rugged Spanish home. As 
 a bravado, the king, in the very sheer ascent, trolled a ballad, a 
 wild Scottish song, and Richard answered by a few notes of 
 a Moorish air. A voice seemed to answer him, not an echo, for 
 it was not his own, but taking the thrilling sweetness of 
 Monina's tones. Ah ! ungentle waves, and untaught winds, 
 whither bear ye now the soft nursling of Andalusia? Such 
 a thought darkened York's brow ; when the king, pausing in 
 his toil, leaned against a jutting crag — both young, both gallant, 
 both so noble and so beautiful ; of what could they think — of 
 what speak ? Not of the well-governed realm of the one, nor 
 the yet unconquered kingdom of the other; of such they might 
 have spoken among statesmen and warriors, in palaces or on the 
 tattle plain J but here, in this wild solitude, the vast theatro

 rliose shifting scenes and splendid decorations were tlie clouds, 
 the mountain, tlie forest, and the vrave, where man stood, not as 
 one of the links of society, forced bj his relative position to 
 consider his station and his rank, but as a human beinti:, ani- 
 mated only by such emotions as were the growth of his own 
 nature — of what should they speak — the young, the beautiful — > 
 but love ! 
 
 ** Tell me, gentle cavalier," cried James, suddenly ; " hast thou 
 ever been in love? Now would I give my jewel-hiltcd dagger 
 to tear thy secret from thee," continued the king, laughing ; for 
 York's eyes had flashed with sudden light, and then fell down- 
 cast. Where were his thoughts ? at his journey's goal, or on 
 the ocean sea ? If he smiled, it was for Kate ; but the tear that 
 glittered on his long eyelashes, spoke of his Spanish maid. Yet 
 it was not the passion of love that he now felt for his childhood 
 companion ; it was tenderness, a brother's care, a friend's watch- 
 fulness, all that man can feel for woman, unblended with the 
 desire of making her his ; but gratitude and distance had so 
 blended and mingled his emotions, that, thus addressed, he 
 almost felt as if he had been detected in a crime. 
 
 ** Now, by the Holy Rood, thou blushest," said James, much 
 amused ; " not more deeply was fair Eatherine's cheek bedyed, 
 when I put the self-same question to her. Does your grace 
 guess, wherefore we journey northwards?" 
 
 Richard turned an inquiring and unquiet look upon his royal 
 companion. A kind of doubt was communicated to James's 
 mind ; he knew little of his friend's former life : was it not 
 possible that engagements were already formed, incompatible 
 with his plans ? With some haughtiness, for his impetuous - 
 spirit ill brooked the slightest check, he disclosed the object 
 of their visit to Castle Gordon, and the proposal he had made to 
 the earl to unite him in marriage to the Scottish princess. 
 
 " When I shall possess my kingdom — when I may name 
 my wife, that which she is, or nothing — queen ! " llichard 
 exclaimed. 
 
 " Nay, I speak of no millenium, but of the present hour," 
 said James. 
 
 The enthusiastic king, bent upon his purpose, went on to 
 speak of all the advantages that would result from tliis union. 
 York's silence nettled him : the prince's thoughts were, indeed, 
 opposed to the exultation and delight which his friend had 
 expected to see painted on his face. The first glad thought of a 
 lover is to protect and exalt her he loves. Katherine was 
 a princess in her native land ; — and what was he? — an outcast 
 and a beggar — a vagabond upon the earth — a man allied to all

234 THE MAEEIAGE. 
 
 that was majSfnificent in hope — to all that ima^nation could 
 paint of gallant and true in himself, and devoted and noble in Ms 
 friends. But these were idealities to the vulgar eye ; and he 
 had only a title as unreal as these, and a mere shadowy right, 
 to bestow. It had been sinful even to ally Monina to his 
 broken fortunes ; but this high offspring of a palace — the very 
 offer, generous as it was, humbled him. A few minutes' silence 
 intervened ; and, in a colder tone James was about to address 
 him, when York gave words to all the conflicting emotions in 
 his breast— speaking such gratitude, love, hope, and despair, as 
 reassured his friend, and made him the more resolved to conquer 
 the difficulties unexpectedly given birth to by the disinterested- 
 ness of his guest. 
 
 A contest ensued ; Eichard deprecating the rich gift offered to 
 him — the king warmly asserting that he must accept it. The 
 words vagabond and outcast were treason to his friendship : if, 
 which was impossible, they did not succeed in enforcing the 
 rights to his ancestral kingdom, was not Scotland his home — for 
 ever his-home — if he married Katherine? And the monarch 
 went on to describe the happiness of their future lives — a trio 
 bound by the, ties of kindred — by affection — by the virtues, nay, 
 even by the faults of each. He spoke also of the disturbances 
 that so often had wrecked the fortunes of the proudest Scottish 
 nobles, and said, that a princess of that land, united, it might 
 be, to one of its chiefs, trimmed her bark for no summer sea. 
 *' Like these wild Highlands are our storm-nursed lives," 
 continued James. " By our ruder thanes the beautiful and 
 weak are not respected ; and tempest and ruin visit ever the 
 topmost places. Eate is familiar to such fears, or rather to the 
 resignation and courage such prospects may inspire. Look 
 around on these crags ! listen ! the storm is rising on the hills- 
 howling among the pines. Such has been my cousin's nursery 
 — such the school which has made her no slave of luxury ; no 
 frail floweret, to be scared when the rough wind visits her 
 cheek." 
 
 In such discussions the travellers beguiled the time. The 
 day was stormy ; but, eager to arrive, they did not heed its 
 pelting. York had a^sun in his own heart, that beamed on him 
 in spite of the clouds overhead. Notwithstanding his first keen 
 emotion of pain at the idea of linking one so lovely to his dark 
 fate, the entrancing thought of possessing Katherine — that she 
 had already consented to be his — animated him with delight, 
 vague indeed ; for yet he struggled against the flattering illusion. 
 
 After battling the whole day against a succession of steep 
 acclivities, as evening drew near, the friends gained the last hill-

 top, and stood on its brow, overlooking a fertile plain or strath, 
 -—an island of verdurj amidst the black, precipitous mountains 
 that frircled it. The sun was ^'dden by the western mountains, 
 which cast their shadow into the vaUey ; but the clouds were 
 dispersed, and the round full silvery moon was pacing up the 
 eastern heaven. The plain at their feet was studded by villages, 
 adorned by groves, and threaded by two rivers, whose high, 
 romantic banks varied the scene. An extensive, strongly-built 
 castle stood on the hill that overhung one of the streams, 
 looking proudly down on this strath, which contained nearly 
 thirty-six square miles of fertile ground. " Behold," said James, 
 *' the kingdom of Lord Huntley, where he is far more absolute 
 than I in my bonny Edinburgh. The Gordon fought for the 
 Bruce ; and the monarch bestowed on him this fair, wide plain 
 as his reward. Bruce flying before his enemies, on foot, almost 
 alone, among these savage Grampians, then looked upon it as 
 now we do." 
 
 King James's thoughts were full of that wild exhilaration of 
 spirit, which none, save the inhabitant of a mountainous country, 
 knows, when desolation is around — a desolation which is to him 
 the pledge of freedom and of power. But York had other ideas : 
 lie had been told that the Lady Katherine had yielded a willing 
 consent to the proposal made ; and she whom he had before 
 conversed with only as a gentle friend — she, the lovely and the 
 good — his young heart beat thick, — it had no imagery, far less 
 words, expressive of the rapture of love, tortured by the belief 
 that such a prize he ought to — he must — resign. 
 
 The petty tyranny of trivial circumstance often has more 
 power over our best-judged designs, than our pride permits us 
 to confess. From the moment York entered Castle Gordon, he 
 found an almost invisible, but all-conquering net thrown over 
 him, The Gordon, for thus the earl of Huntley preferred being 
 called, when surrounded by his clan in his northern fastness, 
 received the princes with barbaric, but extreme magnificence : 
 his dress was resplendent ; his followers numerous, and richly 
 clad according to Highland ideas of pomp. But no Lady 
 Katherine was there, and it soon became apparent that Richard 
 was first to see her at the altar. Sounds of nuptial festivity 
 rang through the castle ; instead of grace or generosity attend- 
 ing his meditated declining of the honour, it would have borne 
 the guise of an arrogant refusal. There was also something in 
 the savage look of the clansmen, in the rude uncivilization of 
 her native halls, where defence and attack formed the creed and 
 practice of all, that reconciled him to the idea of leading her 
 from the wild north to softer, milder scenes ; where every

 disaster wears a gentler shape ; soothed, not exasperated by the 
 ministrations of nature. 
 
 At midnight, but a very few hours after his arrival, he stood, 
 beside her in the chapel to interchange their vows. The earl 
 had decorated the holy place with every emblem that spoke of 
 his own greatness, and that of his son-in-law. The stylo of 
 royalty was applied to him, and the ambitious noble, *' over- 
 leaping" himself, grasped with childish or savage impetuosity at 
 the shadowy sceptre, and obscure cloud-wrapt crown of 'the 
 royal exile. York, when he saw the princess, summoned all his 
 discernment to read content or dissatisfaction in her eyes ; if 
 any of the latter should appear, even there he would renounce 
 his hopes. All was calm, celestially serene. Nay, something 
 almost of exultation struggled through the placid expression of 
 her features, as she cast her eyes up to heaven, till modest 
 gentleness veiled them again, and they were bent to earth. 
 
 The generosity and pride of woman had kindled these sen- 
 timents. The Lady Katheriue, a princess by birth, would 
 scarcely have dreamed of resisting her father's behests, even 
 if they had been in opposition to her desires ; but here she was 
 to sacrifice no inclination, nothing but prosperity ; that must 
 depart for ever, she felt she knew, when she became the bride 
 of England's outcast prince. Yet should aught of good and 
 great cling to him, it was her gift ; and to bestow was the 
 passion of her guileless heart. It was not reason ; it was 
 feeling, perhaps superstition, that inspired these ideas. The 
 seer who foretold her fortunes, had been her tutor and her 
 poet ; she believed in him, and believed that all would be accom- 
 plished ; even to the death of the beautiful and beloved being 
 who stood in the pride and strength of youth at her side. All 
 must be endured ; for it was the will of Heaven. Meanwhile, 
 that lie should be happy during his mortal career was to be her 
 study, her gift, the aim of her life. In consenting to be his, 
 she also had made a condition, that, if defeat awaited his arras, 
 and that again a wanderer he was obliged to fly before his 
 enemies, she was not to be divided from him; if no longer here, 
 she was to be permitted to join him ; if he departed, she should 
 accompany him. 
 
 As the priest bestowed his benediction on the illustrious and 
 beauteous pair, a silent vow was formed in the heart of either. 
 Doomed by his ill-fate to hardship and dependence, he would 
 find in her a medicine for all his woes, a wife, even the better, 
 purer part of himself, who would never sufler him to despair ; 
 but who would take the bitterer portion of his sorrow on her- 
 self, giving in return the heroism, the piety, the serene content

 wkicli was tlie essence of licr beinor. His vow, it depended not 
 on himself, poor fellow ! " Never throiij]:h me shall she suffer," 
 was the fervent resolve. Alas ! as if weak mortal hands could 
 hold back giant Calamity, when he seizes the heart, and rends 
 it at his pleasure.

 The royal party returned to Edinburgh, where the nuptials 
 of Eichard of England and the Lady Katherine were celebrated 
 with splendour. Festivities of all kinds, tournaments, hunting 
 parties, balls, succeeded to each other ; but far beyond every 
 outward demonstration was the real happiness insured by this 
 marriage. Graced by Katherine, the Kttle English court became 
 a paradise. The princess assumed her new character among 
 the exiles with facility ; yet the phrase is bad, for Katherine 
 could assume nothing, not even a virtue, if she had it not. In 
 every position she was not princess, queen, patroness, or mis- 
 tress ; but woman merely — a true-hearted, gentle, refined 
 woman. She was too young for the maternal character to be 
 appropriate to her, yet the watchfulness and care she had for 
 all resembled it. Her new subjects felt as if before they had 
 been a disconnected, vagabond troop, and that dignity and 
 station were assigned to them through her ; through her the 
 charities and elegances of life hallowed and adorned them. The 
 quality most peculiarly her own was the divine simplicity Avhich 
 animated her look, her manners, her acts. Taintless simplicity, 
 that best of fascinations, whose power is not imperious and 
 sudden, but gradual and changeless, where every word spoken 
 is but the genuine interpreter of the feelings of the heart, to 
 which not only falsehood, but even the slightest disguise or 
 affectation, is wholly foreign j and which is the more dehcate,

 ■winninof and kind, from being spontaneous — so that, as in de- 
 scribinij her, her royal cousin had said, "you almost questioned 
 her authority from its want of pretension, yet yielded to it in 
 all its extent." 
 
 Eichard's political position stood higher than ever. The 
 ever-watchful duchess of Burgundy had sent a renowned Bur- 
 gundian captain. Sir Koderick-de-Lalayne, with two hundred 
 German mercenaries. The king of France, at the request of 
 Henry the Seventh, had despatched an embassy to King James, 
 to advise a peace between England and Scotland. The am- 
 bassador was the Sire de Concressault, York's ancient friend, 
 who continued to espouse his cause warmly, and gave it all the 
 grace and honour of his high influence. King James was eager 
 to collect his army, and to prepare for an invasion. If Hichard 
 had lost any part of his open-hearted confidence and personal 
 friendship, he had gained in his esteem and consideration. The 
 change that had been operating was imperceptible to York, who 
 naturally found in his marriage a barrier to the hourly inter- 
 course they had formerly had, when both were free. Yet change 
 there was, greater even than the king himself suspected ; the 
 causes were easily traced. 
 
 The Tudor party in Scotland, instigated by bribes and large 
 promises, were very active m their enmity to the White Rose. 
 They had been obliged to let the torrent of royal favour force 
 its headlong way, but they watched the slightest pause in its 
 flow, to throw impediments in the way of the abundant stream. 
 Soon after his return from the ]N"orth, it became apparent that 
 the king continued no unsuccessful suitor to the Lady Jane 
 Kennedy. This a good deal estranged him from his English 
 friend, who no longer reproved, but whose tacit condemnation 
 he feared, as well as that of his fair cousin. Nay, more, Lady 
 Jane had drawn from him the cause of their transient quarrel, 
 and, now that she had yielded, felt angry and disdainful at the 
 attempt made to estrange her lover. One of those lower eddies 
 or currents of intelligence, so in use at courts, had reported an 
 angry expression of hers to the earl of Buchan, one of York's 
 most active enemies. This grasping-place in their difficult way 
 was eagerly laid hold of by the conspirators. A coalition was 
 formed between Lady Jane and this party, which insured the 
 aggravation of any ill-feeling thnt might arise between the late 
 brothers in heart. Soon after another agent or tool was added 
 to their number. 
 
 The most subtle, the most politic, the most wily, are some- 
 times the slaves of impulse ; nay, very often those who fancy 
 that they measure their actions the most narrowly by the rules,

 either of self-interest or ambition, are more easily influenced to 
 unwise passion by any obstacle thrown in their path. The 
 Secretary Frion had hitherto considered himself of primal im- 
 port to the English prince : no project was conceived, that was 
 not first concocted in his brain, and insinuated by him ; every 
 new partizan had been enticed by his silvery speeches ; what- 
 ever of difficult, crooked, and hidden was to be done, Frion was 
 consulted, and employed, and deeply trusted in its accomplish- 
 ment. On his first arrival in Scotland, the intimacy between 
 the king and York destroyed half his influence. James's dis- 
 cernment and experience was not duped by the insinuating 
 flatteries of Frion : as a proud man he disdained, as a con- 
 scientious and pious one, he dishked him. It was worse when 
 Katherine's influence became paramount ; she put him exactly 
 in his right place, yet was so kind that there was no room for 
 complaint : all his former patrons were her worshippers ; her 
 praises were re-echoed from all ; and assuredly no intrigue 
 could exist where she was. Yet it was neither comprehensible, 
 nor to be endured, that this banished prince and his friends 
 should walk straight forward in their allotted route, unaided by 
 plot or manoeuvre. The subtlety of the man quickly revealed to 
 him the existence of the opposing party ; he was ready to 
 foment it, were it only to gain reputation afterwards by its 
 destruction. He made one step, and became the confidant of 
 Balmayne, and apparently the tool of the higher confederates : 
 at first he rather perplexed than served them, spinning spiders' 
 webs in their way, and elevating himself in their eyes by brushing 
 them ofi'at his pleasure. He was exactly the man to shine in a 
 dark conspiracy : soon nothing could be done but by his advice, 
 nothing known but as he informed them, nothing said but as he 
 dictated. Balmayne, who, fierce and moody, entered more zeal- 
 ously into these discontents than any other, yet took his counsel 
 — little knew they Maitre Etienne Frion : he only watched the 
 while, sage fisher of men as he- was, for the best opportunity of 
 betraying them for his own advantage. In the midst of festivity, 
 of gallant, warlike preparation, Frion had, like a witch gathering 
 poisonous herbs by the silvery light of the quiet moon, sought 
 to extract all that was baleful in what, but for the uses to which 
 he strove to put it, had died innocuous. 
 
 The winter grew into spring : these were the happiest months 
 of young Eichard's life. He had traversed many a pass of 
 danger and tract of sorrow — falsehood had blotted — loss of 
 friends, who had died for him, had darkened the past years : 
 often during their course he had believed that he gave himself 
 up to despair J he had fancied that he had doubted every one

 and every thing ; he imagined that he was tired of existence- 
 vain ideas ! Sanguine, confiding, full to the very brim of that 
 spirit of life -vrhich is the happiness of the young, he sprang up 
 a fresh Antaeus, each time that Fortune with Herculean power 
 had thrown him to the earth. And now he congratulated him- 
 self even on every misery, every reverse, every sentiment of 
 despondency that he experienced : they were so many links of 
 the chain that made him what he was — the friend of James, the 
 husband of Katherine. It was this best attribute of sunny- 
 hearted youth, this greenness of the soul, that made Richard 
 so frank, so noble, so generous ; care and time had laboured in 
 vain — no wrinkle, no deforming line marked his mind, or, that 
 mind's interpreter, his open, candid brow. 
 
 With the spring the Scottish troops drew together, and 
 encamped near Edinburgh. The occasion seemed seasonable ; 
 for news arrived of disturbances which had taken place in 
 England, and which had caused Henry the Seventh to recall the 
 earl of Surrey (who was conducting an army northward to 
 oppose the expected attack from Scotland), to check and defeat 
 enemies which had arisen in the west of his kingdom. The 
 inhabitants of Cornwall, vexed by increasing taxes, had long been 
 in a state of turbulence ; and now, instigated by two ringleaders 
 from among themselves, combined together, and rose in open and 
 regulated rebellion — sedition, it might have been called ; and 
 had perhaps been easily crushed, but for the interference of one, 
 who acted from designs and views which at first had made no 
 part of the projects of the insurgents. 
 
 Lord Audley had not forgotten the "White Hose. On his return 
 westward, however, he found all so quiet, that no effort of his 
 could rouse the rich and satisfied men of Devon, from their 
 inglorious repose. His imprudence attracted attention ; he had 
 notice of the danger of an arrest, and suddenly resolved to quit 
 the post he had chosen, and to join the duke of York in Ireland. 
 He came too late ; the English squadron had sailed ; and he, 
 changeful as the winds and as impetuous, despising a danger 
 now remote, resolved to return to England, and to Devonshire. 
 His voyage from Cork to Bristol was sufficiently disastrous; 
 contrary and violent winds drove him from his course into the 
 Atlantic ; here he beat about for several days, till the wind, 
 shifting a point or two to the west, he began to make what sail 
 he could in the opposite direction. Still the weather was tem- 
 pestuous, and his skiff laboured frightfully amidst the stormy 
 waves ; not far from them, during the greatest fury of the gale, 
 was a larger vessel, if such might be called the helmless, dismasted 
 hull, tossed by the billows, the sport of the winds, as it rose and

 fell in the trongli of the sea. At leno;th the wind lulled ; and the 
 captain of tlic caravel, which indeed mi^rht be called a wreck, 
 lowered a boat, andcnme alongside Lord Audlcj's vessel, asking 
 whither he was bound? To England, was the answer; and the vast 
 reef of clouds lifted on the southern horizon, and showing beyond 
 a streak of azure, gave promise of success in their voyage. The 
 questioner, who spoke English imperfectly, went on to say, that 
 in spite of the miserable state of the caravel, he was resolved not 
 to desert her, but to carry her, God willing, into the nearest 
 Erench port he could make. But there was on board one sick, a 
 woman, whom he wished to spare the dangers and privations of 
 the voyage. Would the commander take her to England, and 
 bestow her in some convent, where she might be tended and 
 kept in honourable safety P Lord Audley gave a willing consent, 
 and the boat went off speedily, returning again with their stranger 
 passenger. She was in the extremity of illness, even of danger, 
 and lay, like a child, in the arms of the dark, tall, weather-beaten 
 mariner, who, though squalid in his appearance from fatigue and 
 want, stood as a rock that has braved a thousand storms ; his 
 muscles seemed iron — his countenance not stern, but calm and 
 resolved — yet tenderness and softness were in the expression of 
 his lips, as he gazed on his fragile charge, and placed her with 
 feminine gentleness on such rude couch as could be afforded ; 
 then addressing Lord Audley, "You are an Englishman," he said, 
 " perhaps a father?" 
 
 "I am an English noble," replied the other; "confide in my 
 care, my honour ; but, to be doubly sure, if you feel distrust, 
 remain with us ; yonder wreck will not weather another 
 night." 
 
 " She has seen the suns of two worlds," said the sailor, proudly, 
 " and the blessed Virgin has saved her at a worse hazard. If^she 
 perish now, it were little worth that her old captain survived : 
 better both go down, as, if not now, some day we shall, together. 
 I will confide my poor child to you, my lord. If she recover, 
 ehe has friends in England ; she would gain them, even if she 
 had them not. Not one among your boasted island-women is 
 more lovely or more virtuous, than my poor, my much-suffering 
 Monina." 
 
 Lord Audley renewed his protestations. De Earo listened 
 with the ingenuous confidence of a sailor; he placed several 
 caskets and a well-filled bag of gold in the noble's hand, saying, 
 " The Adalid fills a-pace. You but rob the ocean. If my child 
 survives, you can give her the treasure you disdain. If she does " 
 — and he bent over her ; she almost seemed to sleep, so oppressed 
 was she by feebleness and fever. A tear fell from her father's

 eye upon lier brow : " And slie will : Saint Mary guide us, we 
 shall attain." 
 
 Suck was the stranj^c drama acted on tlie wide boundless sea. 
 Such the chances that restored the hiofh-minded Andalusian to 
 England, to the White Eose, to all the scenes, to every hope and 
 fear which she had resolved to abandon for ever, lor good or 
 ill, we are in the hands of a superior power : 
 
 " There 's a divinity that shapes our ends. 
 Rough-hew them how we will." 
 
 We can only resolve, or rather endeavour, to act our parts well, 
 such as they are allotted to us. Little choice have we to seek or 
 to eschew our several destinations. 
 
 With Monina at his side, and his own restless ambition as a 
 spur, it may be easily imagined what Lord Audley's projects were 
 in joining the Cornish insurgents. He led them I'rom the western 
 extremity of the island towards Kent, where he hoped to find 
 the seeds of rebellion to Lancaster, which he had sown the year 
 before, ripened into harvest. News of the unimpeded marcii of 
 the insurgents from Cornwall to the neighbourhood of Lojidon 
 ■was brought to Edinburgh, freshening the zeal and animating 
 the preparations for war. 
 
 Already the Scottish army was encamped south of Edinburgh. 
 The English troops set up their tents among them. The day 
 was fixed for the departure of the king, the prince, and the 
 noble leaders. They quitted Edinburgh in all the pompous 
 array of men assured of victorj-. James loved the hopes and 
 stirring delights of war: Ilichard saw his every good in life 
 dependent on this expedition, and fostered sanguine expectation 
 of triumph. The burning desire of asserting himself, of re- 
 warding his faithful friends, of decorating Katheriue with the 
 rank and honours due to her — tlie belief that he slioukl achieve 
 all this — gave dignity and even gladness, to his last adieu to 
 his lovely wife. Her heart mirrored his hopes; not that she 
 entertained them for her o^n, but for his sake : yet the quicker 
 sensibilities of a woman imparted fears unknown to him. She 
 concealed them, till when, as her last office and duty, she had 
 fastened an embroidered scarf around him. Softly, whisperingl}", 
 as fearful of paining him, she said, " You will return — you 
 have a kingdom here : though England prove false, you must 
 not disdain to be sole monarch of Katherine." 
 
 These words had been spoken — earl, baron, and gallant knight 
 thronged tlie courts of Holyrood. There was the sound of war- 
 like trump and the streaming of painted banners, among which, 
 that of the White Bose waved conspicuous. 'J'lie king vaulted

 on his saddle ; the prince of England rode at his side. He was 
 surrounded by the rude northern warlike chiefs, ancient ene- 
 mies of his native land, whose fierce eyes were li^^hted up by the 
 expectation of meetin<^ their old adversaries in the field. Could 
 he fancy that, through such aid, he might win back the crown 
 usurped from him ? 
 
 King James and Eichard rode side by side. At this moment, 
 when the one was spending the riches of his kingdom and the 
 lives of his subjects for the other's sake, while the hearts of both 
 were softened by regret for their abandoned home, and both 
 anticipated the joys of victory or perils of defeat to be shared 
 between them, the sentiment of friendship was rekindled. IN'ever 
 had they been more cordial, more confidential, more happy in 
 each other's society. After several hours' ride, the short spring 
 day declined to evening, which was accompanied by a drizzling 
 rain : the bad roads and the darkness impeded their progress ; 
 and it was night before the twinkling camp-lights appeared in 
 the distance and the hum of men was heard. To the right of 
 the camp, surrounded by the tents of his nobles, the royal pavi- 
 lion was pitched. On their arrival, the earl of Euchan v.as in 
 readiness to hold the king's stirrup. "JN'ay," said James, "first 
 we will see our royal guest lodged ; where is the tent of his 
 grace of England ? we commanded it to be pitched in close 
 neighbourhood to our own ? " 
 
 *' Please you, my liege," said Buchan, " Lord Mora^^, gave 
 direction it should be placed out of our line ; it is set up a mile 
 eastward of us." 
 
 " My uncle forgot himself; and you also, sir earl, were bound 
 rather to obey our order," said the king. 
 
 " There vrcre reasons," returned Buchan : " your majesty, I 
 dare aver, will approve the change, and his highness of England 
 also. There was a brawl between the Scottish borderers and 
 the English; blood has been shed. We feared that the peace 
 of the encampment, not to say the life of his highness, would 
 be endangered if he were in the midst of our savage Southrons." 
 
 " I like not this," said James, moodily, '•' but it is too late to 
 change to-night. The rain-drops begin to freeze upon my hair ; 
 your highness would rather be in year tent, far though it be 
 from mine, than quarrel about its position at this inclement 
 hour. Lord Buchan, you will attend him thither. Prince, good- 
 night; to-morrow we will be more brotherly in our fashion ; now 
 the fiat of my lord of Moray must be obeyed." 
 
 The king dismounted, and entered his pavilion : as the cloth 
 was raised, a blazing fire, the apparel of silver flagons and 
 golden cups, the trim appearance of siiken-suited pages were

 visible, making strong contrast with tlie cheerless blank without. 
 One slight glimpse revealed the cause, and partly excused the 
 inhospitality of James, in not inviting his guest to partake his 
 warm cheer. One in a kirtle sat somewhat retired from view ; 
 the quick motion of her head, the glance of her dark eye, 
 showed that the monarch had been impatiently expected, and 
 was gladly welcomed by the lovely daughter of the earl of 
 Cassils. 
 
 Lord Buchan accompanied Eichard, Lord Barry, and Plan- 
 tagenet to their quarters ; talking, as he went, of the contention, 
 which had terminated fatally to several. They rode down the 
 elevated ground on which the king's tent was placed, over a 
 plashy, low plain, through a little wood of stunted larch, across a 
 narrow dell, in whose bottom a brook struggled and murmured, 
 to the acclivity on the other side, on which the tents of the 
 English troops were pitched ; considerably apart from the rest 
 was Richard's own pavilion: all looked tranquil and even deso- 
 late, compared to the stirring liveliness of the Scotch camp, 
 llichard was received by Sir George I^eville, who looked more 
 than usually cold and haughty as he bent to Lord Buchan'a 
 salutation : the Scotchman uttered a hasty good night, galloped 
 down the upland and across the dell, and was lost to sight in the 
 wood. 
 
 " What means this, Sir George ? " was the prince's first 
 remark : " what discipline is yours — brawling and bloodshed 
 with our allies .f' " 
 
 " Did your highness name them our enemies," said Neville, 
 " it were more appropriate. Suspend your displeasure, I beseech 
 you, until I can lay before you the reality of what you name a 
 brawl ; my honour, and I fear all our safeties are concerned in 
 the discovery. Now, your grace is wet and fatigued ; you will 
 repose ? " 
 
 Richard desired solitude, not rest : he wished to be alone ; for 
 a thousand intricate ideas possessed him, clamouring to be 
 attended to. He dismissed his friends. Prion only remained — 
 Prion, who lately had almost become surly, but who was now- 
 smooth, supple as ever ; his eye twinkling as of yore, and his 
 ready laugh — that most characteristic part of him — again show- 
 ing the old secretary returned. To the prince's warm heart, the 
 appearance of discontent and moodiness was peculiarly grating ; 
 the smile or frown even of Frion had power over him ; and he 
 felt grateful to the man for his glossy and satisfactory speeches, 
 now that, spite of himself, a feeling — it was not fear, but an 
 anticipation of evil — disturbed his mind. 
 
 At length, he dismissed him j yet still he felt utterly disin-

 clined for sleep. For some time lie paced his tent ; images of 
 war and battle floated before liim — and tben the vision of an 
 angel with golden hair, came, not to calm, but to trouble him 
 with unquiet regret. In vain he strove to awaken the flock of 
 gentle thoughts that usually occupied him ; his ideas seemed 
 wolf-visaged ; unreal bowlings and cries rung in his ears. This 
 unusual state of mind was intolerable : he folded his cloak round 
 him, and stepped into his outer tent. Frion, two pages, and his 
 esquire, were to occupy it; but he found it solitary. This 
 seemed a little strange ; but it was early yet. He lifted the 
 outer cloth ; a sentinel was duly at his post ; the prince saluted 
 him and passed on. The fitful winds of spring had dispersed the 
 storm : the scarcely waning moon, encircled by the dark clear 
 ether, was in the east ; her yellow light filled the atmosphere, 
 and lay glowing on the trees and little hill-side. The prince 
 stepped onwards, down the declivity, across the dell, into the 
 wood. He thought he heard voices ; or was it only the swinging 
 branches of the pines ? The breeze raised his hair and freshened 
 his brow. Still he walked on, till now he came in view of the 
 Scottish camp, which lay tranquil as sheep in a fold, the moon's 
 bright eye gazing on it. The sight brought proud Granada and 
 all its towers, with the Christian camp sleeping at her feet, 
 before his mind ; and he still lingered. Now the tramp of horses 
 became audible : a troop wound down the hill : the leader stopped 
 exclaiming in some wonder, " My lord of York ! does your 
 highness need any service ? do you bend your steps to the royal 
 tent ? " 
 
 " I blush to answer. Sir Patrick," replied the prince ; " for you 
 will scoff at me as the moon's minion : I came out but to visit 
 her. Yet a knight need not feel shame at loitering beneath her 
 rav, dreaming of his lady-love. You are more actively em- 
 ployed F " 
 
 " I was on my way to your highness's encampment," replied 
 the knight. " His majesty is not quite satisfied with Lord 
 Buchan's report, and sent but now his esquire to me, to bid me 
 visit it. With your good leave, I will escort you thither."

 THE ASSASSIN. 
 
 Traitor, what hast thou done? how ever may 
 I'hy cursed hand so cruelly have swayed 
 Against that kuij^ht ? I J arrow and weal-away ? 
 After so wicked deed, why liv'st thou longer da.y ! 
 
 Sfe.vser. 
 
 When he bad been dismissed by Lis royal mastei', Prion called 
 aside the esquire, and sent him on an errand, it would seem of 
 some import and distance ; for the youth uttered a few forcible 
 interjections, and with a lowering brow drew on the riding-boots 
 lie had just doffed, muttering, "I must treat my horse better 
 than my lord treats me; so, master, seek a fresh steed. By my 
 fay ! this is to become a squire of dames — a love-token to the 
 duchess, in good hour ! " 
 
 Having got rid of this young gentleman, Prion's next care wag 
 to give distant employment to the pages, saying he would wait 
 their return. But scarcely had the}^ entered the most crowded 
 part of the camp, before with quick cautious steps the secretary 
 took the same path which the prince trod half an hour later — he 
 crossed the dell, and arriving- at the little wood of larches, 
 instead of traversing, he skirted it, till the gentle eminence on 
 which the English camp was pitched, grew higher and more 
 abrupt, the murmuring brook took the guise of a brawling tor- 
 rent, grey rocks peeped out from the soil, and the scene became 
 wilder and more mountainous : he walked on, till he arrived 
 where a rustic bridge spanned the stream ; under its shadow 
 were three horsemen, two of whom dismounted, and a tall servi- 
 tor held the bridles. One of these men Frion knew at once to 
 be him who called himself Lord Bothwell, King Henry's spy, 
 and liichard's fierce, motiveless, but ruthless enemy ; the other 
 — his bonnet was drawn over his brow — a cloak obscured his 
 person. Frion's quick eyes scrutinized it vainly, for the moon, 
 cloudy at intervals, gave uncertain light ; besides, the man had 
 stationed himself within the deepest shadow of the bridge/

 *'(5-ood befall your watch," said Frion ; "your worsliip is 
 before your time." 
 
 *' Is not all ready? " asked Ealmayne. 
 
 "That question is raine," replied the other. "You know 
 our treaty — not a hair of my lord's head must be injured." 
 
 " Tush ! tush ! fear not, good conscience-stickier," replied 
 Bothwcll, with a contemptuous laugh ; " no ill will befall the 
 boy ; we but ferry him over the Tweed a few hours earlier than. 
 he dreamed of, and land him all gently on the shore he seeks. 
 As for thy reward, I have said, name it thyself." 
 
 "Fair words are these, Sir John Eamsay," said Frion ; "but 
 I said before, I must have surer pledge, both for mj^ rev\ ard and 
 my lord's safety. King Henry will haggle about payment 
 when the work is done, and the steel you wear is a toper in its 
 way." 
 
 " How now, sir knave?" cried Balmayue; "thinkest thou that I 
 will turn midnight stabber ? " 
 
 The man in the cloak started at these words. He uttered 
 some sound, but again drew back ; while the person who con- 
 tinued on horseback said, and his voice was that of the bishop 
 of Moray, King James's uncle, " A truce to this contention, 
 Master Good-fellow — whatever thy name be : I will answer for 
 thy pay, and here is earnest of my truth." He threw a purse at 
 Frion's feet. " The peace of two kingdoms — the honour of a 
 royal, too long dishonoured house are at stake. No time is this 
 to squabble for marks, or the paltry life of a base impostor. T, 
 a prince of Scotland, avouch the deed. It were more friendly, 
 methinks; to unlock his life with the steel key of our friend 
 Wiatt, than to devote him to the gallows. Let Scotland be rid 
 of him, I reck not how." 
 
 Again Frion fixed his eyes .on the other;— the clouds had 
 fallen low in the sky ; the moon was clear ; the western breeze 
 murmured among the bushes and the trees, and the beams of 
 the silvery planet played upon the unquiet waters. "We have 
 no time for delay. Sir John," said Frion, " prithee introduce me 
 to our fellow-labourer — this is the king's emissary ? You call 
 yourself Wiatt, Master Black Cloak ?" 
 
 The other made a gesture of impatience as he stepped aside. 
 Calmayne and Moray discoursed aside, till the former bade the 
 secretary lead on ; as they went, the Scotchman and Frion con- 
 versed in whispers concerning their plans, while their companion 
 followed as if doggedly. Once he cast an impatient glance at 
 the moon — Frion caught that look. " Have I found you, good 
 friend," he thought; "then by our lady of Embrun, you shall 
 acquit you of the debt I claim this night."

248 THE ASSASSIN. 
 
 Witli quicker steps the ProTencal proceeded, till they readied 
 the opening of the valley, and came opposite the slope on which 
 the English camp was pitched. Furthest off and far apart was 
 the royal pavilion, the banner of England flapping in the breeze, 
 and this the only sign of life ; but for this, the white silent tents 
 looked like vast Druidical stones piled upon a wild moor. They 
 paused. " I must go first," said Frion ; " we have wasted 
 more time than I counted for — you will await me here." 
 
 "Listen, Master Frion," said Balmayne. "I would hardly 
 trust you, but that I think you are a wise man ; silver angels 
 and golden marks, as a wise man, you will love : one thing you 
 will hardly seek, a shroud of moonbeams, a grave in the vulture's 
 maw. Look ye, one soars above even now; he scents dainty fare: 
 twenty true men are vowed that he shall sup on thee, if thou art 
 foresworn : thou wilt give some signal, when all is ready." 
 
 "That were difficult," said Frion; "I will return anon if 
 there be any let to your enterprise ; else, v.hen the shadow of 
 that tall larch blackens the white stone at your feet, come up 
 without fear : have ye bonds ready for your prisoner ? " 
 
 "An adamantine chain — away !" Frion cast one more glance 
 at him called "Wiatt. " It is even he, I know him, by that trick 
 of his neck ; his face was ever looking sideways :" thus assured, 
 the Frenchman ascended the hill. Balmayne watched him, 
 now visible, and now half-hid by the deceptive light, till he 
 entered the folds of the pavilion ; and then he glanced his eyes 
 upon the shadow of the tree, yet far from the white stone ; and 
 then paced the sward, as if disdaining to hold commune with 
 Wiatt. "Whatever thoughts possessed this hireling's .breast he 
 made no sign, but stood motionless as a statue ; his arms folded, 
 his head declined upon his breast. He was short, even slight in 
 make, his motionless, half-shrinking attitude contrasted with the 
 striding pace and the huge, erect form of the borderer. Who 
 that had looked down upon these two figures, sole animations 
 visible on the green earth beneath the moon's bright eye, would 
 have read villany and murder in their appearance ; the soft 
 sweet night seemed an antidote to savageness, yet neither moon 
 nor the sleeping face of beauteous earth imparted any gentleness 
 to the Scot ; he saw neither, except when impatiently he glanced 
 at the slow-crawling shadow, and the moonlight sleeping on the 
 signal-stone. Many minutes passed — Bothwell gave one impatient 
 look more — how slowly the dusky line proceeded ! He walked 
 to the edge of the brook ; there was no movement about the 
 pavilion : tranquil as an infant's sleep was the whole encamp- 
 ment. Suddenly a cry made him start, it was from Wiatt ; the 
 man, heretofore so statue-like, had thrown his arms upward with

 a passionate gesture, and then recalled by Botliwell's impreca- 
 tion, shrunk back into his former quiet, pointing only with a 
 trembling finger to the stone, now deep imbedded in the black 
 shadow of the larch. The Scot gave a short shrill laugh, and 
 crying "Follow !" began the ascent, taking advantage of such 
 broken ground and shrubs, as blotted the brightness of the rays 
 that lit up the acclivity. Bothwell strode on with the activity of 
 a mosstrooper ; Wiatt was scarce able to walk ; he stumbled 
 several times. At length they reached the pavihon ; the French- 
 ! man stood just within, lifting the heavy cloth ; they entered. 
 Frion whispered, " I have cleared the coast ; my lord sleeps ; we 
 need but cast a cloak around him, to blind him, and so bear him 
 off without more ado on his forced journey." 
 
 "There is wisdom in your speech," said Balmayne, with some- 
 thing of a grin. " My friend Wiatt has a cloak large and dark 
 enough for the nonce." 
 
 Frion drew back the silken lining of the inner tent, saying, 
 " Tread soft, my lord ever sleeps lightly; he must not be waked 
 too soon," 
 
 '^ Never were the bett-er word," muttered Bothwell: the dim- 
 mest twilight reigned in the tent. The prince's couch was iu 
 shadow ; the men drew near ; the sleeper was wrapt in his silken 
 coverlid, with his face buried in his pillow : his light-brown 
 hair, lying in large clusters on his cheek, veiled him completely. 
 Hamsay bent over him ; his breathing was heavy and regular ; 
 he put out his large bony hand, and, as gently as he might, 
 removed the quilt, uncovering the sleeper's right side ; then 
 turning to Wiatt, who had not yet advanced, he pointed to 
 the heaving heart of his victim with such a glance of murder- 
 ous callousness, that the very assassin shrunk beneath it ; yet 
 he approached ; his hand held an unsheathed dagger, but it 
 shook even to impotence ; he raised it over his prey, but had 
 no power to strike. Frion had crept round behind ; a sound 
 just then, and tramp of feet was heard in the outer tent ; as by 
 magic, in one brief second of time the mute dread scene changed 
 its every cha,racteristic. The assassin cried aloud, "It is not 
 he ! " Frion had seized his arm — the dagger fell — the pretended 
 sleeper (one of York's pages) leaped from the couch ; and the 
 muffling cloak, dropp^ig from the murderer's shoulders, disclosed 
 the wretched, degraded Clifford. Eamsay drew his sword, and 
 rushed towards the outer tent, wlien at the same moment Richard 
 of York and Sir Patrick Hamilton showed themselves from 
 beneath the hangings, which their attendants had raised. This 
 sight startled Frion, and Clifford, restored to life and energy, 
 tore himself from his grasp, and in a moaient had rushed from

 beno.atli the pavilion ; he was forgotten; all eyes were turned on 
 Eothwell ; the dagger at his feet, his drawn sword, his appear- 
 ance in the retirement of the prince of England, all accused him. 
 He saw at once his danger, drew himself proudly up, and 
 returned Hamilton's look with a fierce, haughty glare. 
 
 " Thy act is worse than thy enemies' speech," said Sir Patrick, 
 sternly ; " thou wilt answer this, recreant, to thy royal ninster." 
 
 "To him, to any, to you," said Balmayne; "there is my 
 glove. Now, on the hill's side, or in the lists anon, I will avouch 
 my deed." 
 
 Hamilton answered with a look of sovereign contempt ; he 
 bade his men seize the traitor. " Before I sleep," he cried, " the 
 king hears this treason." 
 
 Eichard had looked on in silence and wonder ; he placed his 
 hand on Hamilton's arm, stopping him, '• Pardon me, valiant 
 knight," he said ; " but, I do beseech you, disturb not the king 
 to-niglit, nor ever, with this ill tale. Too roughly already has the 
 English prince broken Scotland's rest. No blood is shed ; and, 
 strange as appearances are, I take Sir John Pamsay's word, and 
 believe that, as a cavalier, he may maintain his cause, nor stain 
 by it his knightly cognizance. I take up your glove, fair sir, but 
 only to restore it; without one slightest accusation attaching 
 itself to you therewith. Na}^ myself will take up the quarrel, 
 if any blame you. Sir Patrick will not call me to the trial, I 
 am sure. Prion, conduct the gallant gentleman beyond our 
 lines." 
 
 Shame for the first time flushed Pamsay's brow as he left the 
 tent. The prince drew up to let him pass, with a mien so digni- 
 fied and yet so tranquil, with a smile so bland, that thus it 
 seemed an angelic essence, incapable of wound, might have gazed 
 on a mere mortal, armed to injure him. 
 
 " Is this recklessness or nobility of soul ? " Sir Patrick thought. 
 He did not doubt, when" Pichard, changing his look to one of 
 anxious appeal, besought him to omit utterly to report this 
 strange scene. " I much fear," he said, " my wily secretary to 
 be most in fault ; and I caught a glance of one, whose appear- 
 ance here proves that Pamsay is not alone guilty. Let me 
 inquire, let me learn — punish, if need be. English gold and 
 English steel were the weapons here, and I alone have power 
 over England. You will pledge me your word. Sir Patrick, not 
 to disquiet our ro3'-al cousin by our domestic brawls. We must 
 not put in opposing scales our paltry anger against ruffians like 
 these, and the disquiet of the generous-hearted James. Pamsay 
 was his father's favourite ; for his sake he bears with him ; and 
 more easily may I. I indeed, who am most in fault, for spending

 , the precious minufces wandering, like a slieplierd of Arcadia, in 
 ' a listless foolishness, instead of actinjr the general, and guarding 
 \ my tents from such visitors. The brawl last night might have 
 i forewarned me." 
 
 I " Does it not shame Scotland," cried Hamilton, warmly, " that 
 you should need any guard but our true hearts, while you tread 
 our soil? " 
 
 "Were this true," answered York, yet more earnestly, 
 "remember, wliat shames Scotland, shames her king. Be assured, 
 dear cousin, I speak advisedly. Were this examined, worse 
 might appear; and I and your liege must be the sufferers : I to 
 excite this treason in his subjects' hearts ; he to prove that some 
 near him are not true as they seem." 
 
 Hamilton yielded to these many pleas ; but his heart warmed 
 with admiration and love for the noble being who urged the 
 cause Ol pardon for his enemies. " Be it as your highness 
 pleases," he exclaimed. " This I the more readily yield, since 
 any new attempt kills Hamilton ere it reach you. I will be your 
 guard, your sentinel, your wide, invulnerable shield; you will 
 not refuse me this post of lionour." 
 
 " Or let us both fulfil it," cried York, '"'one to the other; let 
 us be brothers in arms, noble Hamilton. And yet, how can I, a 
 fugitive, almost a tainted man, seek the alliance of one who 
 stands as you do, liiir and free in all men's eyes ? " 
 
 As he spoke, the prince held out his hand ; the Scottish knight 
 raised it respectfully to his lips. But now Frion returned ; and 
 the clash of arms and trumpets' sound spoke of the advance of 
 niijht, and change of guard: the noble friends took leave of each 
 other, and Sir Patrick departed. As soon as they were private, 
 the prince questioned his secretary closely and sternly as to the 
 events of the night. Frion had a plausible and ready tale, of 
 artifice and guile, of how he had a pledge even from the king's 
 uncle that York's life was not to be attempted ; and that he had 
 but Avished to balk and vex them, by causing the page to be 
 carried off: the discovery of their mistake would shame them 
 from any second enterprize against the prince of England. 
 
 York was but half satisfied ; lie had caught a transient glimpse 
 of the fugitive. Was it indeed Clifford, who came a hired 
 murderer to his bedside ? A man wlio had partaken his heart's 
 counsels, long his companion, once his friend? It was frightful, 
 it was humiliating but to imagine how deep the man may fall, 
 who once gives himself over to evil thoughts, and unlawful 
 deeds. Frion here protested his ignorance and surprise. It 
 was almost day before his master dismissed him : and even then, 
 how could Eichard repose ? That couch, Clifford had marked as

 Lis bier — it were a bed of tliorna ; lie threw himself on the bare 
 hard ground, and innocence had more power than his angelic 
 pitv for the vice of others ; it shed poppy influence on his lids ; 
 and the beams of the morning sun stole softly oyer, but did not 
 disturb his slumbers.

 Faster than the airy slave quicksilver is influenced by the 
 changes of the atmosphere, does the subtle essence of the mind 
 of one, who from love or gratitude hangs upon the smile or 
 frown of another, feel the sunshine'or frost of that other's coun- 
 tenance ; and an independent disposition speedily revolts from 
 servile obedience to such alteration. On the following day, and 
 afterwards on the succeeding ones, Eichard felt that the heart 
 of James was no longer the same. He was courteous, kind — 
 his friend's interests formed the sole topic of their conversations 
 ■ — but York could neither say the thing he wished, nor do tliat 
 which he desired ; the same objects were before him, apparently 
 the same colouring was upon them ; yet a pale sickly hue wag 
 cast over the before glowing picture ; a chill had penetrated the 
 summer warmth in which he basked ; the wave was yet calm, 
 but it was clouded, and no longer showed in its limpid depths 
 that sympathy and affection which made the White Eose's 
 fortunes seem truly and intrinsically Scotland's own. 
 
 Friendship M'as now professed, service tendered ; before words 
 had seemed superfluous — the thing was there. James assured 
 his guest that he would not turn back, nor give ear to Henry's 
 propositions ; and York felt, with a start, that ear had been, 
 given to them, or this conclusion had not been noted. The dis- 
 union and continued separation of the camps was another 
 circumstance that spoke' loudly of division of thought and 
 counBel.

 JFrion believed that he should now resume his ancient position 
 with his royal roaster : he bore his reproofs humbly, and strove 
 to regain his favour by the importance o^ his services. The 
 arcana of the Tudor party were, to a great degree, revealed to 
 York ; and it was easy to mark the ascendancy it was gaining. 
 The presence of Lady Jane Kennedy might explain the cere- 
 mony and regulations observed in the intercourse between the 
 king and his friend ; but it was Frion's part to disclose the 
 enmity this lady entertained for the White Hose, and the 
 influence slie exerted to its detriment. Moray and Lord Buchan 
 ! were her friends, and they were frequent visitors in the royal 
 pavilion. 
 
 A short time somewhat changed this state of things. The 
 army drew near the frontier ; and the king separated himself 
 from the fair mistress of his heart. On the third day they 
 arrived on the banks of the Tweed. It was but crossing a little 
 river — but- stepping from one stone to another, and Eichard 
 would stand on English ground. 
 
 The troops had passed the day before ; some had proceeded 
 southward ; others were even now to be seen defiling in long 
 lines on the distant plain. The sun was up cheerily ; the fresh 
 pleasant green of spring had stolen, more like a tinted atmo- 
 sphere, than in the guise of foliage, over tree and bush ; field 
 flowers and crocusses peeped from under the mossy turf. The 
 scene was a wide moor, varied by broken ground ; clumps of 
 trees, where many a bird nestled; and here and there thick 
 underwood, where the wild deer made his lair ; this had bsen 
 the scene of a thousand conflicts, and of mortal carnage between 
 Scot and Englishman, but the skylark above sang of nature's 
 bounty and nature's loveliness, an immemorial and perennial 
 hymn, while nothing spoke of the butchery and wretchedness 
 which once had made the landscape a tragic corpse-strewn 
 stage. 
 
 Heining in his pawing courser, King James, in all the gay 
 array of a high-born knight, paused on the Scottish bank — his 
 lips, proud as the Apollo's — spoke of struggle and victory, 
 
 " In his eye 
 And nostril, beautiful disdain and might 
 And majesty flashed their f ull hghtnings by." 
 
 Here was he who, in a later day, led the flower of Scotland to 
 die on the English plains ; who himself was doomed to lie with 
 mangled limbs, and in blank, cold extinction, a trophy of victory 
 to his enemy, on Elodden Field : he was alive now, and in his 
 strength ; he drank in with buoyant spirit every glorious antici-

 pation, and lau|;lied with fond deliplit ; spurring on his horse, 
 he crossed the ford, and entered England. 
 
 In a moment, as by impulse, York, wlio had lingered, dashed 
 afcer him ; allies they were ; friends in seeming, nay, in truth ; 
 for the glance of proud enmity Hiehard cast on the Scot was 
 perhaps the more factitious feeling : it sprang from patriotism, 
 but its energy was borrowed from the deadly feuds of their 
 ancestors, that natural hate which is said to exist now between 
 the French and English, and which was far more envenomed 
 between the near-rival people. Notwithstanding James's change 
 towards him, York felt in the core of his affectionate heart, all 
 that was due to him who had raised him v. heu he was fallen ; 
 given him state, power — Katherine ; he saw in him his kinsman 
 — his benefactor. But the pride of a son of England rose in his 
 breast, when he beheld the haughty Scot caracol in arrogant 
 triumph on her soil. ~\Yhat was he ? What had he done ? He 
 was born king and father of this realm : because he was despoiled 
 of his high riglits, was he to abjure his natural duty to her, as 
 her child ? Yet here he was an invader ; not arming one division 
 of her sons against the other, but girt with foreigners, aided by 
 the ancient ravagers of her smiling villages and plenteous har- 
 vests. He looked on each individual Scot, and on their gallant 
 king, and felt his bosom swell with rage and hate. These were 
 unwise, nay, ungrateful sentiments ; but he could not repel 
 them. His first commands were to his cousin, to hasten to 
 liandal of Dacre, to learn what Yorkists had gathered together 
 to receive him. " If there be any large company," he said, 
 " without more ado we will thank our kind cousin, invite him to 
 recross the Tweed, and leave us to fight our battles by our- 
 selves." 
 
 The satisfaction and triumph James felt made him, so far 
 from participating in York's feelings, turn with renewed cor- 
 diality towards him. It was his first care to have the standard 
 of the White E-ose sot up with martial pomp, to disperse his 
 proclamations, and to" invite, by his own manner, the Scottish 
 nobles to increase in observance towards the prince. Lord 
 Huntley, believing that the prophecy of his daughter's elevation 
 was on the eve of its accomplishment, was prodigal of his shows 
 of honour and service to his son-in-law. For some days the 
 pavilions of the brother kings were pitched side by side, and 
 James each hour thought to hear of the arrival of the Yorkist 
 nobility of England : he had expected so many that he had 
 given orders that care should be taken to recall his own troops, 
 when the English visitants outnumbered his own guard. Day 
 after day passed, and not one came — not one : even Eaudal of

 Dacre, Lord Dacre's brother, who had visited Eichard iu Scot- 
 land, seized with panic, had gone southward. Nothing came, 
 save intelligence that the Cornish insurgents had been defeated 
 on Blackheatb, their ringleaders taken and executed ; amoug 
 them Lord Audley perished. 
 
 Another life ! — how many more to complete the sad hecatomb, 
 a useless offering to obdurate fate in Kichard's favour ! Sir 
 George Neville, gathered up in all the cold pride of disappointed 
 ambition, disdained to regret. Piantagenet saw the hopes and 
 purpose of his life crushed, but dared not give words to his 
 despair ; Sir Roderick sneered ; Lord Barry was loud in his 
 laments ; while the Scots grew taller and prouder, and ceased 
 to frequent the tents of the English exiles. Councils were held 
 by James, in which York had no part ; it was only afterwards, 
 that he learnt it had been commanded to the Scotch army to 
 lay waste the country. Now indeed all the Englishman was 
 alive in his heart — he gave sudden orders to raise his camp, and 
 to march forward ; he had sat still too long ; he would enter 
 the kingdom he claimed ; discover for himself his chance of suc- 
 cess — and, if there were none, his rights should not be made 
 the pretence of a Scotch invasion. 
 
 None cried, "Long live King Pachard !" as he passed along. 
 How did his noble, youthful spirit droop at finding that not 
 only he did not meet with, but was judged not to deserve success. 
 It ranks among the most painful of our young feelings, to find 
 that we are justly accused of acting wrong. Our motives — we 
 believed them disinterested or justifiable ; we have advanced a 
 wondrous step in life before we can concede even to ourselves 
 that alloy may be mingled with what we deemed pure gold : 
 ignorant of the soil and culture of our own hearts, we feel sure 
 that no base mixture can form a part of what we fancy to be 
 a mine of virgin ore, Eichard would have stood erect and chal- 
 lenged the world to accuse him — God and his right, was his 
 defence. His right ! Ob, narrow and selfish was that sentiment 
 that could see, in any right appertaining to one man the excuse 
 for the misery of thousands. 
 
 War, held in leash during the army's march from Edinburgh, 
 was now let loose ; swift and barbarous he tore forward on his 
 way ; a thousand destructions waited on him ; his track was 
 marked by ruin : the words of Lord Surrey were fulfilled. 
 What a sight for one, whoso best hope in acquiring his kingdom, 
 was to bestow the happiness of which the usurper deprived it. 
 The English troops, about five hundred men, crossed the 
 wide-spread plains in the immediate vicinity of Scotland ; they 
 entered a beaten track, where the traces of cultivation spoke of

 man ; a villacre peeped from among the bedjre-row trees — York's 
 heart beat high. Would the simple inhabitants refuse to ac- 
 knowledge him ? A few steps disclosed the truth — the village 
 had been sacked bj the Scotch : it was half burnt, and quite 
 deserted ; one woman alone remained — she sat on a pile of ashes 
 wailing aloud. The exiles dared not read in each other's eyes 
 the expression of their horror ; they walked on like men re- 
 buked. This was England, their country, their native home ; 
 and they had brought the fierce Scot upon her. Passing for- 
 ward, they met trains of waggons laden with spoil, droves of 
 cattle and sheep. They overtook a troop roasting an ox by the 
 burning rafters of a farm-house, whose green palings, trim 
 orchard, and shaved grass-plat, spoke of domestic comfort ; the 
 house-dog barked fearfully — a Lowland archer transfixed him 
 with his arrow. 
 
 The English marched on ; they dared not eye the ravagers ; 
 shame and hate contended — these were their allies; while the 
 sarcasm and scornful laugh which followed them, drugged with 
 wormwood the bitter draught. In vain, west or east or south, 
 did they turn their eyes, a sad variety of the same misery pre- 
 sented itself on every side. A stout yeoman, gashed by an 
 Highlander's claymore, was sometimes the ghastly stepping- 
 stone passed over to enter his own abode ; women and children 
 had not been spared, or were only left to perish for want. 
 Often during apparent silence, a fearful shriek, or the voice of 
 lamentation, burst upon the air : now it was a woman's cry, 
 now the shrill plaint of infancy. With the exception of these 
 sufferers, the landscape was a blank. Where were the troops 
 of friends Eichard had hoped would hail him? Where the 
 ancient Yorkists? Gone to augment the army which Surrey 
 was bringing against the Scot; attached to these ill-omened 
 allies, how could the prince hope to be met by his partizans ? 
 He had lost them all ; the first North Briton who crossed the 
 Tweed trampled on and destroyed for ever the fallen White 
 Hose. 
 
 Kesolutely bent on going forward till he should have advanced 
 beyond the Scotch, on the following day York continued his 
 march. They entered the ruins of another village ; the desola- 
 tion here was even more complete, although more recent ; the 
 fiame was hardly spent upon the blackened rafters ; the piles 
 which the day before had been smiling dwellings, still smoked ; 
 a few domestic animals were skulking about. There was a 
 church at the end of what had been a street ; this was not 
 spared. The English entered the desecrated aisle ; an aged 
 bleeding monk was lying at the altar's foot, who scowled even

 in death upon the soldiery ; suddenly he recognized his country- 
 men; pleasure gleamed in his sunken eyes, "Ye ^vill avenge 
 us ! Deliver the land ! — The hand of God will lead ye on ! " 
 
 Plantagenet rushed forward — " Father I" he cried, " do I find 
 you here ?" 
 
 The old man spoke, looked faintly ; Edmund bent over him : 
 " My father, it is I, Edmund, your boy, your murde " 
 
 " My son," said the monk, " I behold you again, and die 
 content ! You are in arms, but by the blessing of the saints 
 your sword's point is turned against the cruel invader. ISTot 
 one, oh ! not one Englishman will fall by his brother's hand, for 
 not one will fight for that base deceit, the ill-nurtured Perkin, 
 to whom God in his wrath has given such show of right as brings 
 the Scot upon us. Once I thought — but no son of York would 
 ally himself to these cruel border-robbers. God of my country, 
 oh curse, curse him and his cause !" 
 
 The dying man spoke with difficulty ; a few moments more, a 
 spasm crossed his features, and they settled into stony insen- 
 sibility. Edmund threw himself on the body ; a deathlike 
 silence reigned in the building ; every heart beat with breathless 
 horror ; the curse uttered by the murdered man was even then 
 breathed before God, and accepted. York spoke first with a 
 calm, firm voice, "Arise, my cousin," he said; "do not thou 
 fix yet more deeply the barbed arrow, which has entered my 
 heart." 
 
 There are periods when remorse and horror conquer by their 
 intensity every lesser impulse, and reign kings of the waste ; 
 this was no time for words or tears. Oh ! welcome the grief or 
 crime, which the bitterest of these could express or extenuate ; 
 it would insult this sad effiszy of death to imagine that the im- 
 piety could be expiated. In silence they bore the reverend 
 corpse to the vaults of the church, and then continued their 
 way ; some of the under-officers and men whispered together ; 
 but when again the chiefs conversed, they did not allude to this 
 frightful scene, or to the awful imprecation which they felt sus- 
 pended over their heads, shadowing their souls with unknown 
 horror. 
 
 This was but the opening scene to worse wretchedness ; 
 hitherto they had seen the waste of war, now they came upon 
 its active atrocities. A dense smoke, the flickering of pale 
 flames, marked the progress of devastation ; fierceness gleamed 
 in the open blue eyes of Eichard; he bit his hps, and at a 
 quicker pace went forward ; screams and horrid shrieks, mixed 
 with shouts — oh ! may not a veil be drawn over such horrors — 
 flying children, mothers who stayed to die, fathers who unarmed

 ruslied upon tlie weapons of the foe ; fire and sword, animated 
 by man's fellest spirit, were there to destroy. Eindled to fur}^, 
 ifork and his chief friends had outspeeded their troops : they 
 came to save ; they called on the fierce Scot to spare ; and, 
 when their words were unheeded, they drew their swords to 
 beat back their allies. A fresh troop of Borderers, headed by 
 Sir John Ramsay, at this moment poured into the village. The 
 grey eye of the Scot was lighted up to the fiercest rage ; but 
 when he saw who and how few were they who had assailed his 
 men, a demoniac expression, half exultation and joy, half deadly 
 hate, animated him. Kichard was driving before him a whole 
 troop of camp-followers, cowardly and cruel fellows. Balmayne's 
 hand was on his arm. "Your Highness forgets yourself," ho 
 said ; " or is the fable ended, and you turned friend of Tudor?" 
 
 York's blood was up ; his cheek, his brow were flushed ; the 
 word " assassin " burst from his lips, as he wheeled round and 
 assailed his midnight foe. Thus a natural war began ; English 
 and Scotchmen, bent on mutual destruction, spurred on by 
 every feeling of revenge, abhorrence, and national rivalship, 
 dealt cruel blows one on the other. Richard's troops began to 
 arrive in greater numbers ; they far out-told their adversaries. 
 Lord Bothwell, with his marauders, was obhged to retreat, and 
 Y^ork was left in possession of his strange conquest. The 
 peasantry gathered round him : they did not recognize the 
 White Eose, they but blessed him as their deliverer : yet the 
 sufferers were many, and the flames still raged One woman 
 with a wild shriek for her children, threw herself into the very 
 heart of her burning cot; while, statue-like, amidst a little 
 helpless brood, his wife at his feet a corpse, his dwelling in 
 ashes, a stout yeoman stood ; tears unheeded flowing down his 
 weather-beaten cheeks. During the whole day Eichard had 
 striven against his own emotions, trying to dispel by pride, and 
 indignation, and enforced fortitude, the softness that invaded 
 his heart and rose to his eyes, blinding them ; but the sight of 
 these miserable beings, victims of his right, grew into a tragedy 
 too sad to endure. One young mother laid her infant offspring 
 at his feet, crying, " Bless thee ; thou hast saved her ! " and 
 then sunk in insensibility before him ; her stained dress and 
 pallid cheeks speaking too plainly of wounds and death. Eichard 
 burst into tears, " Oh ray stony and hard-frozen heart ! " he 
 cried, *' which breakest not to see the loss and slaughter of so 
 many of thy natural- born subjects and vassals ! " 
 
 He spoke — he looked : Plantagenet was there, grief and 
 borror seated in his dark, expressive eyes ; JN'eville, who had 
 lost his lofty pride j it was shame and self-abhorrence that

 they but quit one carcase, to pounce upon another." 
 
 " Do we fight the king of England's battles ? " cried the 
 Burgundian Lalayne, in unfeigned astonishment : " this will be 
 strange intelligence for James of Scotland," 
 
 " So strange, Sir Eoderick," said Hichard, " that we will be 
 the bearers of it ourselves. Give orders for the retreat, gentle- 
 men. His majesty is engaged in the siege- of Norham Castle. 
 We will present us before him, and demand mercy for our un- 
 happy subjects."

 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, 
 And make me travel forth without my cloak,

 It was York's characteristic to be sanguine beyond all men. 
 Pain impressed him more deeply and sorely, than could be 
 imagined by the cold of spirit ; but show him the remedy, teach 
 him the path to redress, and he threw oiF the clogging weight 
 of care, and rose free and bright as in earliest vouth. His im- 
 patience to behold his royal friend, to speak the little word, 
 which he felt assured would recall the Scots from their ravages, 
 and take from him the guilt of his subjects' blood, grew like a 
 torrent in the spring : — he outspeeded his main troop ; he left 
 all but his chiefest friends behind ; one by one even these grew 
 fewer ; he mounted a fresh horse, it was the third that day — 
 " May-flower is worse than blown," said ]>J^eville ; " will not 
 your highness repose till to-morrow ? " 
 
 " Repose ! " — this echo was his only answer, and already he 
 was far and alone upon his way. 
 
 The Scottish lines were passed, and the embattled walls of 
 Norham, grey and impenetrable as rock, were before him ; the 
 royal pavilion occupied the centre of the camp. The wearied 
 steed that bore York dropt on one knee as he reined him up

 before it, flushed, with, every mark of travel and haste — he threw 
 himself from his saddle, and entered the tent : it was thronged ; 
 he saw not one face, save that of the monarch himself, who was 
 conversing with a churchman, whose dark foreign countenance 
 Eichard had seen before ; now it was like a vision before him. 
 James, in an accent of surprise, cried, " My lord, this is an un- 
 expected visit." 
 
 " Excuse ceremony, my dear cousin," said York ; " I come 
 not to speak to the majesty of Scotland : man to man — a friend 
 to his dearest friend — I have a suit to urge." 
 • James, who was aware that his actual occupation of listening 
 and even acceding to the suggestions of his foreign visitant, in 
 favour of peace with Henry, was treason to York's cause, thought 
 that news of Don Pedro D'Ayala's arrival was the secret of 
 these words : he blushed as he replied, " As friend to friend, we 
 will hear anon — to-morrow." 
 
 " There is no anon to my dear plea," said York ; " even now 
 the hellish work is about which you must check. Oh, what am 
 I, king of Scotland, that I am to be made the curse and scourge 
 of my own people? The name of Hichard is the bye-word of 
 hate and terror, there, where I seek for blessings and filial love. 
 You know not the mischief your fierce Borderers achieve — it is 
 not yet too late ; recall your men ; bid them spare my people ; 
 let not the blood of my subjects plead against my right ; rather 
 would I pine in exile for ever, than occasion the slaughter and 
 misery of my countrymen, my children." 
 
 Eichard spoke impetuously ; his eyes filled with tears, his 
 accents were fraught with passionate entreaty, and yet with a 
 firm persuasion that he spoke not in vain : but his address had 
 the very worst efiect. James believed that, hearing that he was 
 in treaty with his foe, he had come to re-urge his suit, to enforce 
 the many promises given, to demand a continuation of the war. 
 James, a Scotchman, bred in civil strife among fierce Highlanders 
 and ruthless Borderers, saw something contemptible in this pity 
 and supplication for cottagers and villains : the shame he had 
 felt, or feared to feel, at the idea of being accused of treachery 
 by his guest, was lightened ; his lips were curled even to scorn, 
 as in a cold tone he replied, " Sir, methinketh you take much 
 pains, and very much strive to preserve the realm of another 
 prince, which, I do believe, never will be yours." 
 
 A momentary surprise set open wide York's eyes ; he glanced 
 round him ; the earl of Huntley's brow was clouded ; a smile 
 curled Lord Buchan's lips ; the emotion that had convulsed the 
 prince's features, gave place to the calmest dignity. " If not 
 mine," he said, "let me yield the sway to the lady Peace : the

 name and presence of a Plantagenet sliall no longer sanction tlie 
 devastation of his country. I would rather be a cotter on your 
 vrild Highlands, than buy the sovereignty of my fair England 
 by the blood of her inhabitants." 
 
 The warm, though capricious heart of James, was quietly re- 
 called by the look and voice of his once dearest friend, to a sense 
 of the ungraciousness of his proceeding : he frankly stretched 
 out his hand; "I was wrong, cousin, forgive me, we will confer 
 anon. Even now, orders have been issued to recall the troops ; 
 a few words will explain everything." 
 
 York bent his head in acquiescence. The king dismissed his 
 nobles, and committed to the care of one among them the 
 reverend D'Ayala. With a strong sentiment of self-defence, 
 which was self-accusation — a half return of his ancient affection, 
 which acted like remorse — James set himself to explain his pro- 
 ceedings. Fearful, unaided by any of the natives, of proceeding 
 with an inadequate force farther into the heart of the country, 
 he had set down before the castle of Norham, which was de- 
 fended undauntedly by the bishop of Durham. He had wasted 
 much time here ; and now the Cornish insurgents being quelled, 
 the earl of Surrey was marching northwards, at the head of 
 forty thousand men. Surrey, Howard, might he not be a masked 
 friend ? *• who," continued James, " has surely some personal 
 enmity to your highness ; for the reverend Father D'Ayala, an 
 ambassador from Spain, visited him on his journey northward, 
 and it seems the noble indulged in despiteful language ; saying, 
 that he who could bring the fell Scot (I thank him) into Eng- 
 land, wore manifest signs of — I will not say — I remember not 
 his words ; they are of no import. The sum is, my dear lord, 
 I cannot meet the EngHsh army in the open field ; walled town 
 — even those paltry towers — I cannot win : with what shame 
 and haste I may, I must retreat over the border." 
 
 Many more words James, in the heat of repentant affection, 
 said to soothe his English friend. York's blood boiled in his 
 veins ; his mind was a chaos of scorn, mortification, and worse 
 anger against himself. The insult inflicted by James before his 
 assembled lords, the bitter speech of Surrey ; he almost feared 
 that he deserved the one, while he disdained to resent the other ; 
 and both held him silent. As speedily as he might, he took 
 leave of the king : he saw signs in the encampment of the return 
 of the foragers ; they were laden with booty : his heart was 
 sick ; to ease his pent-up burning spirit, when night brought soli- 
 tude, though not repose, he wrote thus to the Lady Catherine :— 
 
 " Wilt thou, dear lady of my heart, descend from thy lofty

 state, and accept an errant kniglit, instead of a sceptered kinp;, 
 for tliy mate ? Alas ! sweet Kate, if thou wilt not, I may never 
 see thee more : for not thus, oh not thus, my God, will Eichard 
 win a kingdom ! Poor England bleeds : our over-zealous 
 cousin has pierced her with dismal wounds ; and thou wouldst 
 in thy gentleness shed a thousand tears, hadst thou beheld 
 the misery that even now, grim and ghastly, floats before my 
 sight. What ana I, that I should be the parent of evil 
 merely? Oh, my mother, my too kind friends, why did ye not 
 conceal me from myself? Teaching me lessons of humbleness, 
 rearing me as a peasant, consigning me to a cloister, my 
 injuries would have died with me ; and the good, the brave, the 
 innocent, who have perished for me, or through me, had been 
 spared ! 
 
 " I fondly thought that mine was no vulgar ambition. I 
 desired the good of others ; the raising up and prosperity of ray 
 country. I saw my father's realm sold to a huckster — his 
 subjects the victims of low-souled avarice. What more apparent 
 duty, than to redeem his crown from Jew-hearted Tudor, and to 
 set the bright jewels, pure and sparkling as when they graced 
 his brow, on the head of his only son ? Even now I think the 
 day will come when I shall repair the losses of this sad hour — is 
 it the restless ambitious spirit of youth that whispers future 
 good, or true forebodings of the final triumph of the right ? 
 
 " Now, O sweetest Kate, I forget disgrace, I forget remorse ; 
 I bury every sorrow in thought of thee. Thy idea is as a windless 
 haven to some way-worn vessel — its nest in a vast oak-tree to a 
 tempest-baffled bird — hope of Paradise to the martyr who 
 expires in pain. Wilt thou receive me with thine own dear 
 smile ? My divine love, I am not worthy of thee ; yet thou 
 art mine — Lackland Richard's single treasure. The stars play 
 strange gambols with us — I am richer than Tudor, and but that 
 tliy husband must leave no questioned name, I would sign a 
 bond with fate — let him take England, give me Katherine. But 
 a prince may not palter with the holy seal God affixes to him — 
 nor one espoused to tliee be less than king j fear not, therefore, 
 that I waver though I pause— Adieu !"

 FOBD. 
 
 Pedeo D'Ayala was ambassador from Ferdinand and Isabella to 
 the kinor of England. There was something congenial in the 
 craft and gravity of this man with the cautious policy of Henry. 
 When the latter complained of the vexation occasioned him by 
 the counterfeit Plantagenet, and the favour he met with in 
 Scotland, D'Ayala offered to use his influence and counsel to 
 terminate these feuds. He found James out of humour with 
 York's ill success among the English, weary of a siege, where 
 impregnable stone walls were his only enemies, uneasy at the 
 advance of Surrey ; pliable, therefore, to all his arguments. 
 A week after D'Ayala's arrival, the Scots had recrossed the 
 Tweed, the king and his nobles had returned to Edinburgh, and 
 York to Katherine. 
 
 Eichard's northern sun was set, and but for this fair star he 
 had been left darkling. "When the English general in his turn 
 crossed the Tweed, and ravaged Scotland, lie was looked on by 
 its inhabitants as the cause of their disasters ; and, but that 
 some loving friends were still true to him, he had been deserted 
 in the land which so lately was a temple of refuge to him. The 
 earl of Huntley exerted himself to prevent his falling into too 
 deep disgrace in the eyes of Scotland, and was present at the 
 consultations of the exiles to urge some new attempt in some 
 other part of King Henry's dominions. York was anxious to 
 wash out the memory of his overthrow ; so that this check, 
 which seemed so final to his hopes, but operated as an incentive 
 to further exertions. Yet whither should he go ? the whole 
 earth was closed upon him. The territory of Burgundy, which 
 had so long been his home, was forbidden. France — Concres- 
 saulfc, who was his attached friend, dissuaded him from encoun-

 tering a mortifjdng repulse there. Even his ow^n Spain would 
 refuse to receive him, now that D'Ayala had shovrn himself his 
 enemy ; but, no, he was not so far reduced to beg a refuge at 
 the limits of civilization ; still he had his sword, his cause, his 
 friends. 
 
 A stranger came, an unexpected visitant from over the sea, to 
 decide his vacillating counsels. The man was aged and silver- 
 haired, smooth in his manners, soft-voiced, yet with quick grey 
 eyes and compressed lips, indications of talent and resolution 
 and subtlety. Frion saw him first, and, deceived by his almost 
 fawning manners into an idea of his insignificance, asked his 
 purpose and name. The stranger with the utmost gentleness 
 refused to disclose his object to any but the prince ; and Frion, 
 with great show of insolence, refused to introduce him to his 
 presence. " Then without thy leave, sir knave,'"' said the old 
 man calmly, " I must force my way." 
 
 Astley, the poor scrivener of Canterbury, was present. This 
 honest, simple-hearted fellow, had shown so much worth, so 
 much zeal, so much humbleness with such fidelity, that he had 
 become a favourite in York's court, and principally with the 
 Lady Catherine. Frion hated him, for he was his opposite, but 
 pretended to despise him, and to use him as an underling. 
 Astley meekly submitted, and at last gained a kind of favour in 
 the Frenchman's eyes by the deference and respect of his 
 manner. The stranger, with the readiness of one accustomed 
 to select agents for his will, addressed him, bidding him an- 
 nounce to his highness a gentleman from Ireland. " And be 
 assured," he said, " the duke will ill-requite any tardiness on 
 thy part." 
 
 An angry burst from Frion interrupted him. This man, 
 rarely off his guard, but roused now by recent mortifications, 
 forgot himself in the violence he displayed, which strangely con- 
 trasted with the soft tranquillity of the stranger, and Astley's 
 modest, but very determined annunciation of his resolve to 
 convey the message to the prince. Frion, from loud words, 
 was about to proceed to acts, when Lord Barry entered — Barry, 
 who felt Scotland as a limbo of despair, who was for ever urging 
 Hichard to visit Ireland, to whom the court life of the English 
 was something like a trim-fenced park to a new caught lion. 
 Barry saw the stranger — his eyes lighted up, nay, danced with 
 sudden joy : with no gentle hand he thrust Frion away, and then 
 bent his knee, asking a blessing of the prior of Kilmainham ; 
 and in the same breath eagerly demanded what had brought the 
 venerable man from Buttevant across the dangerous seas. 
 
 Keating's presence gave newlife to York's councils : he brought

 an invitation from Maurice of Desmond to tlie duke. The 
 earl had, since Eichard's departure, been occupied in trainino^ 
 troops, and so fortifying himself as to enable him to rise against 
 Poynings, whose reg^ular government, and above all, whose pre- 
 dilection for the Butlers, caused him to be detested by the 
 Geraldines. Hurried on by hatred and revenge, Desmond re- 
 solved to do that which would be most dreaded and abhorred of 
 Henry — to assume the badge of the White E-ose, and to set up 
 the pretensions of young Eichard. The tidings were that York 
 was a loved and honoured guest in Edinburgh ; and the im- 
 petuous Desmond feared that he would hardly be induced to 
 abandon King James's powerful alliance, for the friendship of a 
 wild Irish chieftain. The very invitation must be committed to 
 no mean or witless hands : the diiEculties appeared so great, 
 that the measure was on the point of being abandoned, when the 
 prior of Kilmainham, who, in the extreme of age, awoke to 
 fresh life at a prospect of regaining his lost consequence, offered 
 himself to undertake the arduous task. His views went far 
 beyond the earl's : he hoped to make the king of Scotland an 
 active party in his plots, and to contrive a simultaneous invasion 
 of England from the north and from the west. Already his 
 turbulent and grasping spirit saw Irish and Scotch meeting 
 midway in England, and with conjoined forces dethroning 
 Tudor, and dictating terms to his successor. He came too late : 
 he came to find a peace nearly concluded between James and 
 Henry ; the White Eose fallen into disregard ; and his arrival 
 looked, upon as the best hope, the last refuge of his fallen 
 party. 
 
 Eichard on the instant accepted his invitation. To a generous 
 heart the feeling of enforced kindness succeeding to spontaneous 
 affection, is intolerable. The very generosity of his own dis- 
 position made him recoil from exacting a reluctant boon from 
 his sometime friend. To live a pensioner among the turbulent, 
 arrogant Scots, was not to be thought of. The earl of 
 Huntley, in fond expectation of his daughter's greatness, would 
 have despised him had he remained inactive. Even Katherine 
 was solicitous to leave Scotland — she knew her countrymen ; 
 and, ready as she was to give up every exalted aim, and to make 
 her husband's happiness in the retired quiet of private life, she 
 knew that insult and feud would attend his further tarrying 
 among the Scotch. 
 
 York had been for nearly a year the guest of King James ; 
 twelve months, in all their long-drawn train of weeks and days, 
 had paced over the wide earth, marking it with change : each 
 one had left its trace in the soul of Eichard. There is some-

 tiling friglitfal, to a spirit partly tired of the world, to find that 
 their life is to be acquainted with no durable prosperity ; that 
 happiness is but a modification of a train of events, which, like 
 the fleeting birth of flowers, varies the year with different hues. 
 But York was still too young to be aweary even of disappoint- 
 ment ; he met the winter of his fortunes with cheerful fortitude, 
 so that a kind of shame visited James, inspired by the respect 
 his injured friend so well merited. 
 
 The capricious, but really noble heart of the Scottish king was 
 at this time put to a hard trial. One of the preliminaries of 
 peace, most insisted upon by Henry, was, that his rival should 
 be given up to him : — this was, at the word, refused. But even 
 to dismiss him from his kingdom, seemed so dastardly an act 
 towards one allied to him by his own choice, that the swelling 
 heart of the cavalier could not yet tame itself to the statesman's 
 necessity. Some of his subjects, meanwhile, were ready enough 
 to cut the Gordian knot by which he was entangled. Tudor 
 had many emissaries in Edinburgh ; and Lord Moray, Lord 
 Buchan, and the dark Both well, whose enmity had become fierce 
 personal hate, were still egged on by various letters and messages 
 from England to some deed of sanguinary violence. 
 
 Sir John Eamsay was sought out by Frion. That goodly 
 diplomatist must have entertained a high opinion of his molli- 
 fying eloquence, when he dared encounter the hot temper of 
 him he had dishonoured in the eyes of the English prince, and of 
 his own countryman Hamilton. But Erion knew that in oflfering 
 revenge he bought pardon : he was of little mark in Hamsay's 
 eyes, while the man he had injured, and whom he consequently 
 detested beyond every other, survived to tell the grating tale of 
 the defeated villany of the assassin, and the godlike magna- 
 nimity of him who pardoned. 
 
 Erion's own feelings, which had vacillated, were now fixed to 
 betray the prince. He had wavered, because he had a kind 
 of personal affection for the noble adventurer. Somehow he 
 managed to fancy him a creature of his own : he had worked 
 so long, and at one time so well for him, that he had fostered 
 the vain belief that his dearest hopes, and best pretensions, 
 would vanish like morning mist, if he blew unkindly on them. 
 It was not so : James had been his friend ; Huntley had given 
 him his daughter without his interference ; and the Irish 
 project, with Keating at its head, who treated Erion with 
 galling contempt, filled up the measure of his discontents. If 
 anything else had been needed, the Lady Katheriue's favour to 
 Astley, and some offices of trust, in which York himself had 
 used him, sufficed to add the last sting to mahce. " If they wil

 not let me make, they sliall rue the day when I sliall mar ; learn 
 shall they, that Frion can clip an eagle's Tvings even in its pride 
 of flight:" 
 
 It is common to say that there is honour among thieves and 
 villains. It is not honour ; but an acknowledged loss of shame 
 and conscience, and a mutual trust in the instinctive hatred the 
 bad must bear the good, which strongly unites them. In spite 
 of the Frenchman's former treachery, Balmayne felt that he 
 could now confide, that his guilt would stretch far enough to 
 encircle in its embrace the very act he desired ; and he again 
 trusted, and used him as the chief agent of his plots. 
 
 The earl of Surrey was ravaging Scotland ; and King James, 
 with the chivalrous spirit of the times, challenged him to single 
 combat. The earl, in answer, refused to place his master's 
 interests at the hazard of his single prowess, though ready for 
 any other cause to accept the honour tendered him. The herahl 
 that brought this reply, Frion reported to Eichard to be charged 
 with a letter to him. Its purpose was to declare, that though, 
 \vhile aided and comforted by the enemies of England, the earl 
 warred against him, yet the Howard remembered the ancient 
 attachments of his house ; and that, if the White Rose, wholly 
 renouncing the Scotch, would trust to the honour of the repre- 
 sentative of a race of nobles, the army now in the field to his 
 detriment should be turned to an engine of advantage. " Time 
 pressed," the letter concluded b}^ saying — " and if the duke of 
 York were willing to give his sails to the favouring wind, let 
 him repair with a small company to Greenock, where he would 
 find zealous and powerful friends." 
 
 At first this intimation filled the prince with exultation and 
 delight. The time was at last come when he should lead the 
 native nobility of England to the field, and meet his enemy in 
 worthy guise. There was but one check ; he could not join 
 Surrey, while Surrey was in arms against his once generous 
 friend ; so that, by a strange shifting of events, he now became 
 anxious for peace between Scotland and England ; eager that 
 the seal should be set that destroyed the alliance and amity 
 which had so lately been the sole hope of his life. Neville and 
 Plantagenet entered into his views ; and while, seemingly at the 
 bottom of Fortune's scale, a new spirit of gladness animated 
 this little knot of Englishmen. 
 
 For one thing young Richard was not prepared : the prelimi- 
 naries of peace he knew were arranged, and he was aware that 
 its conclusion would take the sword out of James's hand. They 
 had rarely met lately ; and this, while it lessened the familiarity, 
 rather added to the apparent kindness of their interviews.

268 TIDINGS FROM IRELAND. 
 
 There was in both these young princes a genuine warmth of 
 heart, and brightness of spirit, that drew them close whenever 
 they did meet. James honoured the integrity and the uncon- 
 quered soul of the outcast monarch, while his own genius, his 
 vivacity, and polished courtesy, in spite of his caprice and late 
 falling off, spread a charm around that forced admiration and 
 affection even from him he injured. It was at this period, that, 
 notwithstanding their real disunion, Richard felt it as strange 
 to find his royal host confused in manner, and backward of 
 speech. They had been at a hunting party, where Lord Moray's 
 haughty glance of triumph, and the sneer that curled the earl 
 of Buchan's lip, would have disclosed some victory gained by 
 them, had York deigned to regard their aspects. At length, 
 after much hesitation, while riding apart from his peers, James 
 asked — " If there were any news from the Lady Margaret of 
 Burgundy ?" 
 
 " Sir E-oderick Lalayne returned to her a month ago," replied 
 York, " and with him went my dear and zealous Lady Brampton, 
 to urge fresh succour for one, to whom fortune has so long 
 shown a wintry face, that methinks spring must at last be nigh 
 at hand, herald of bright, blossoming summer." 
 
 "What promises then my lady duchess?" said the king, 
 eagerly. 
 
 *•' Alas ! her promises are as blank as her power," replied 
 Richard. " Even when the old dukes of Burgundy were as 
 emperors in Christendom, they were but as provosts and city- 
 magistrates in the free towns of Planders ; and these towns 
 resolve on peace with England." 
 
 " It is the cry of the world," said James, with a sigh ; " this 
 Tudor is a mighty man. Why, even I, a Scot, a warrior, and a 
 king, am forced to join the universal voice, and exclaim, ' Peace 
 with England,' even though my honour is the sacrifice." 
 
 " Your majest}^ imparts no strange truth to me," said York. 
 ** I have long known that this must be ; but surely you speak 
 in soreness of spirit, when you speak of the sacrifice of 
 honour. I thought the terms agreed on were favourable to 
 Scotland?" 
 
 " King Henry demanded, in the first place, the delivery of 
 your highness into his hands." James blushed deeply as he 
 said these words. 
 
 " Or he will come seize me," rejoined the duke, with a laugh. 
 " In good hour I will deliver myself, if he will walk through the 
 bristling lances, and set at naught the wide-mouthed cannon 
 that will bellow in his path." 
 
 "Have you then new hopes?" cried the kingj "oh! say

 but SO ; and half my shame, and all my sorrow vanishes. Say 
 that you have hope of speedy good in some other country ; for 
 "I have sworn, ere April wear into May, Scotland shall be made 
 poor by your highness's absence." 
 
 A long pause followed these words. James felt as if he had 
 given words to his own concealed dishonour, and struck his 
 iron-girdled side with the bitter thought. " O ! spirit of my 
 father, this may not atone ; but I must pay also in shame and 
 torturous self-contempt for my heavy guilt." A sudden blow, a 
 precipitous fall when unaware his feet had reached the crumbling 
 brink of a beetling precipice, would not have made such commo- 
 tion in Hichard's heart, as the forced and frightful conviction 
 that the friend he had trusted heaped this insult on him. For 
 the first time in his life, perhaps, pride conquered every other 
 feeling; for reproach had been more friendly; than the spirit 
 that impelled him, with a placid voice, and a glance of haughty 
 condescension, to reply: — "Now that your majesty dismisses 
 me, I find it fittest season to thank you heartily for your many 
 favours. That you deny me to the suit of your new ally, and 
 send me forth scathless from your kingdom, is the very least of 
 these. Shall I forget that, when, a wanderer and a stranger, I 
 came hither, you were a brother to me ? That when an outcast 
 from the world, Scotland became a home of smiles, and its king 
 my dearest friend ? These are lesser favours ; for your love was 
 of more value to me than your power, though you used it for 
 m.y benefit ; and, when you gave me the Lady Katherine, I 
 incurred such a debt of gratitude, that it were uncancelled, 
 though you cast me, bound hand and foot, at Tudor 's footstool. 
 That I am bankrupt even in thanks, is my worst misery ; yet, if 
 the eye of favour, which I believe Fortune is now opening on 
 me, brighten into noon-day splendour, let James of Scotland ask,

 " Gentle cousin," replied the king, " you gloss with horrid 
 words a bitter pill to both ; for though the scath seem yours, 
 mine is the punishment. I lose what I can ill spare, a kinsman 
 and a friend." 
 
 " ISTever ! " cried York ; " Scotland bids a realmless monarch, 
 a beggar prince, depart : the king of Scotland, moved by strong 
 state necessity, is no longer the ally of the disinherited orphan 
 of Edward the Fourth : but James is Richard's friend ; he will 
 rejoice, when he sees him, borne with the flowing tide, rise from 
 lowness to the highest top at which he aims. And now, dear 
 my lord, grant me one other boon. I am about to depart, even 
 of my own will ; dismiss then every rankling feeling ; lay no

 Feign believed that he held the strings, which commanded 
 the movements of all the puppets about him. The intrigues of 
 party, the habitual use of ill means to what those around him 
 deemed a good end, had so accustomed him to lying and forgery, 
 that his conscience was quite seared to the iniquity of these acts; 
 truth to him was an accident, to be welcomed or not according 
 as it was or was not advantageous to his plots. 
 
 Xing James prepared a fleet for the conveyance of the prince ; 
 and the earl of Huntley, as a matter of course, promised to en- 
 tertain his daughter royally, until, in a palace in Westminster, 
 she should find her destined title and fit abode. The Lady 
 Xatherine thanked him, but declared that she was nothing 
 moved from her bridal vovr, and that she never would desert 
 Richard's side. All that her father urged was of no avail. State 
 and dignity, or their contraries, humiliation and disgrace, could 
 only touch her through her husband ; he was her exalter or 
 debaser, even as he rose or fell ; it was too late now to repine at 
 deiiradation, which it ill beseemed the daughter of a Gordon to 
 encoiyiter ; it was incurred when she plighted her faith at the 
 altar ; wherever she was it must be hers. As a princess, she 
 was lost or redeemed by her husband's fortunes. As a woman, 
 her glory and all her honour must consist in never deviating

 from the straight line of duty, 'which forbade her absence from 
 his side. 
 
 The earl disdained to reason with a fond doting girl, as he 
 called the constant-minded lady, but applied to the king, repre- 
 senting how it would redound to his discredit, should a princess 
 of his blood wander a vagrant beggar over sea and land. James 
 had passed his royal word to Xatherine, that she should have 
 her will on this point ; and when, at her father's suit he tried to 
 dissuade her, he was at once silenced by her simple earnest 
 words; " Ask me not," she said, " to place myself on the list 
 of unworthy women : for your own honour's sake, royal cousin, 
 permit your kinswoman to perform a wife's part unopposed. You 
 and ray father bestowed me, a dutiful subject, an obedient 
 daughter, according to your will ; you transferred my duty and 
 obedience ; and truly as I paid it to you, so will I keep it for 
 my lord." 
 
 " What can we reply, my good earl marshal," said James, 
 turning to Huntley, '* I rebelled against the religion through 
 which I reign, did I deny our sweet Kate free allowance to follow 
 the dictates of her generous heart. Kor let us grudge the White 
 Eose this one fair bloom. Love, such as Katherine feels, love, 
 and the dearest, best gift of God — alas ! too oft denied to poor 
 humanity, and most to me — self-complacency, arising from a 
 good conscience, will repay her every sacrifice." 
 
 Huntley retired in high indignation ; his will was opposed ; 
 his v.-ord, which he deem^ed a law, had but a feather's weight. 
 The blood of the Gordon was stirred to rage ; and he broke 
 forth in fierce and cruel expressions of auger, calling his daugh- 
 ter ingrate — her lord base, and a traitor. Such muttered curses 
 were reported to Lord Buchan : in the scheme on foot, they had 
 somewhat dreaded to incur Huntley's displeasure and revenge, 
 knowing how dearly he prized the hope of royalty for his daugh- 
 ter; but now they fancied that they might draw him in ere he 
 was aware to approve their deed. The crafty Frion was set 
 on to sound him ; the iron was hot, most easily to theii' eyes, 
 it took the desired form. 
 
 Huntley was a Scot, cunning even when angry — cautious 
 when most passionate. The first intimations of the conspiracy 
 were greedily received by him. He learnt the falsehood of the 
 letter pretending to come from the earl of Surrey ; and the use 
 that was to be made of this decoy to seize on the duke of York's 
 person. He did not scruple to promise his assistance ; he reite- 
 rated his angry imprecations against his unworthy son-in-lavr ; 
 he thanked Frion with cordial warmth for aflibrding him this 
 opportunity for revenge ; he declared his gratitude towards the

 confederate nobles ; and tlie Frenchman left him, with the full 
 belief that he was ready to lend his best aid to deliver over the 
 English prince to ignominy and death. 
 
 Such was the end of King Henry's last scheme to obtain pos- 
 session of his too noble, too excelling rival, by means of Scottish 
 fraud, and the treason of York's dependants. The earl of 
 Huntley conducted the whole affair with the utmost secrecy. 
 Apparently he acted the part designed for him by the conspira- 
 tors. He reconciled himself to the prince ; he urged an instant 
 compliance with Surrey's invitation. The Englisli had asked for 
 some guarantee of Surrey's truth. Huntley obviated this diffi- 
 culty. Through his intervention a new and?sufficing impulse 
 was given. Richard appointed the day when he should repair 
 to Greenock, there to meet the envoy who was to lead him to 
 Lord Surrey's presence. In the harbour of Greenock rode the 
 bark which was to convey him to his English prison. King 
 Henry's hirelings were already there : Frion conducted the vic- 
 tims blindfold into the net : they had meant to have gathered 
 together a troop of ruffian borderers to prevent all resistance ; 
 but Huntley promised to be there himself with a band of 
 Highlanders. The whole thing only seemed too easy, too 
 secure. 
 
 The wily secretary had overshot his mark in taking so readily 
 fr>v granted Huntley's assent to the ruin of the duke of York. 
 He had come upon him in his angry hour : his honied words 
 were a dew of poison ; his adjurations for peace, oil to fire. 
 Then, as the noble strode through the hall, imprecating ven- 
 geance, he slid in words that made him stop in full career. Men 
 are apt to see their wishes mirrored in the object before them ; 
 and, when the earl bent his grey eyes upon the Provencal and 
 knit his time-furrowed brow in attention and interest, Frion saw 
 the satisfaction of a man on the brink of dear revenge. He was 
 far a-field. The very rage in which the earl had indulged, by a 
 natural reaction, softened him towards his children ; and when 
 the traitor spoke of schemes ripe to deliver York into his adver- 
 sary's hands, he recoiled at once from the path of vengeance 
 opened before him, and listened with horror to the detail of a 
 conspiracy which would tear the very shadow of a diadem from 
 his daughter's brow; yet he listened, and his words still enticed 
 the over-wily Frion. " Balmayne," said the earl, " all must 
 succeed even to the death. Where he intermeddles, he is ruth- 
 less ;" thus ran his comments : " My good Lord Buchan, what 
 the foul fiend makes him so busy ? Englisli gold ! Yes : 
 Buchan loves the gilding better than the strong iron that it 
 hides. The honour of the royal house, my most reverend uncle !

 Is his animosity so stirring ? Oh ! priests are your only haters. 
 So Richard's tale is told. The chroniclers will speak of Duke 
 Perkin, of the canker that ate out the heart of Gordon's fair 
 rose, the gibbet, instead of a throne, to which she was wed; a 
 fair eminence ! My Kate will hardl}' ascend it with him : she 
 must halt at the gallows' foot." These words, said with bitter- 
 ness, seemed to Frion the boiling sarcasm of an exasperated 
 parent. The man's vanity was the trap in which he was caught: 
 he could not believe that a savage Scot, an untaught Highlander, 
 could enter the lists with one nurtured in the subtle atmosphere 
 of Provence, with the pupil of Louis the Eleventh ; a man 
 schooled in eastern lore, who had passed a whole life of contri- 
 vance and deceit. 
 
 The Scottish nobles, Moray, Buchan, and Both well, were 
 satisfied in having given their countenance to the English hire- 
 lings ; and now that the more powerful Huntley promised to 
 watch over the execution of their designs, they were plad enouo^h 
 to withdraw from the rude and inhospitable "act. Huntley had 
 everything in his own hands. He, with a party of Highlanders, 
 escorted the duke and duchess of York, with their friends and 
 attendants, to Greenock. Prion had never shown himself so 
 humble or so courteous ; he seemed afraid that any one of his 
 victims should escape : he was particularly anxious to entice his 
 old enemy, the prior of Kilmainham, into the snare. His readi- 
 ness and vivacity were remarked by all : it was attributed to the 
 high hopes he entertained of his royal master's success through 
 the alliance of the earl of Surrey ; and, while York expressed 
 his affectionate approbation, he smiled blandly, and painted every 
 feature in the very colouring he wished it to wear. 
 
 The vessel rode at anchor ; the English sailors, on the 
 arrival of York, went on board, got her under weigh, and 
 dropped down the coast. With the dawn Lord Howard of Effing- 
 ham, with a chosen troop, was, according to the false hopes 
 of Richard, to arrive at the rendezvous, a wood about two 
 miles south of the town, bordering the sands of the sea. Here 
 the English emissaries were congregated, and here a score of 
 Highlanders were in ambush, to assist in the capture of the 
 White Eose. Hither, even before dawn, the wakeful Prion 
 came, to announce the speedy arrival of his lord. He found his 
 English friends in some anxiety. Clifford, who, under the 
 name of Wiatt, had been chief among them, was seized with 
 panic or remorse, and had gone on board the vessel, which had 
 east anchor but a few furlongs from the shore. The others 
 were mean underlings : Prion's presence gave them courage ; he 
 was elated j his laugh was free ; he had neither doubt nor

 scruple ; no, not even wlicn he turned from the vulgar, brutalized 
 countenances of these ruffians, to behold the princely victim in 
 all the splendour of innocence, with one beside him so lovely, 
 that the spirit of good itself had selected her form for its best 
 earthly bower ; or to see Edmund, whose dark eyes beamed 
 ■with unknown joy, and Neville, whose haughty glance vfas 
 exchanged for a glad smile. The man's sole thought was 
 exultation at his own cleverness and success, in having inveigled 
 so many of the noble and the brave to this dark fate. 
 
 " What tidings of Effingham ?" asked York. 
 
 ** Are ye ready ? " cried Huntley. 
 
 "All!" replied Prion; "all save him ye name Wiatt. Sir 
 Hobert, forsooth, is but half a man, and never does more than 
 half deed, though that half makes a^hole crime. All is ready. 
 I hear the sound of oars ; the boat nears the shore." 
 
 Through the tall bare trunks of the trees, a glimpse of the 
 beach might be gained ; the roaring of the surges was distinct, 
 now mingled with the cry of sailors. 
 
 " Then lose we no time," said Huntley. *'My lord of York, 
 these words sound strange. You expected a noble countryman 
 to lead you to victory ; you find nameless fellows, and the 
 prince of knaves, most ready and willing to lead you to ever- 
 lasting prison. Lo, the scene shifts again ! Never be cast 
 down, Master Prion ; you are as subtle as any of your race- 
 only to be outwitted by a niggard Scotchman, who can ill read, 
 and worse write ; except when villany is blazoned in a man's 
 face, and his sword indites a traitor's fate. Your clerkship will 
 find none among us learned enough to affi^rd you benefit of 
 clergy." 
 
 Huntley drew his sword ; and at the signal his Highlanders 
 arose from their ambush. Prion was seized and bound. None, 
 who even a moment before had seen the smooth-faced villain, 
 could have recognized him ; he was pale as the snow on Ben 
 Nevis. A Highlander, an adept in such acts, dexterously threw 
 a knotted rope over his head, and cast his eye up to the trees 
 for a convenient branch. Such had been the orders ; such the 
 summary justice of the earl. 
 
 Eichard meanwhile looked on the blanched visage and quail- 
 ing form of his betrayer in mere compassion. "Is it even so, 
 Etienne ! " he said ; " and after long companionship we part 
 thus." 
 
 The trembling craven fell on his knees, though he tightened 
 the halter by the movement, so that when E-ichard turned away, 
 saying,)" I had thought better of thee : Jesu pardon thee as 
 readily as I — farewell ! " he had scarce voice to cry for mercy.

 " Aye," cried the Gordon ; " such mercy as we grant the 
 wolf and thievish fox. Short shrift be thine, Master Secretary !" 
 
 " By Our Lady's grace, stay ! " said Katherine ; *' do not kill 
 the false-hearted knave. He is a coward, and dares survive his 
 honour ; let him live." 
 
 Eichard looked sternly on the kneeling slave. To the good 
 there is something awful in the sight of a guilty man. It is a 
 mystery to them how the human heart can be so perverted. Is 
 it a spirit from hell that incorporates itself with the pulsations 
 of our mortal bosom ; a darkness that overshadows ; a fiendish 
 essence that mingles with the breath God gave to his own 
 image ? York felt a shrinking horror. " Thou hast pursued 
 me since my youth," he said, " forcing thyself into my councils j 
 sometimes as a wily enemy ; at others befriending me in seem- 
 ing, raising my soul, that flagged beneath the world's unkind 
 ministry ; dropping balm by thy words into a wounded heart ; 
 to end thy office thus ! Was this thy purpose ever ; or what 
 demon whispered thee to betray ? Die ! oh no ! too many, the 
 good, the great, the true, have died for me ; live thou a 
 monument — a mark to tell the world that York can pardon, 
 York can despise — not so base a thing as thee — that were little, 
 but even thy employer. Go, tell my sister's husband that I bear 
 a charmed life ; that love and valour are my guards. Bid him 
 bribe those, nor waste his ill-got crowns on such as thee. 
 Unbind him, sirs ; make signal to the boat ; let him on board ; 
 the wind stands fair for England." 
 
 The fall of many a hope, roused by the forgery on Surrey's 
 name, was forgotten by Richard, as he sickened at this other 
 mark of man's wickedness and folly. He was surely the dear 
 sport of fortune, a tale to chronicle how faithless friends may 
 be. If such thoughts, like summer clouds, darkened his mind, 
 they vanished, driven by the winds of life that bore him onward. 
 This was no time* for mere gloomy meditation. Though he was 
 obliged to return to his forgotten Irish scheme, and to dismiss 
 the glorious anticipation in which he had indulged, of leading 
 the chivalry of England to the field ; though no real defeat had 
 ever visited him so keenly as this mockery of one ; yet he was 
 forced to forget himself, and to apply himself to console and 
 rouse his downcast friends ; but his skill was well repaid, and 
 soon he again awoke to those feelings of buoyant hope, 
 unwearied energy, and unshaken confidence which were the 
 essence of his character. 
 
 In this last trial he felt how much good he might derive from 
 the sweetness and constant spirit of the Lady Katherine. She 
 hoped for none of the world's blessings, except they came in the

 sbape of loves from him to whom she was united ; happiness — 
 all hers as centred in her blameless affections ; and her con- 
 fidence was placed in the belief and knowledge, that by devoting 
 herself to her lord, to the wandering outcast who so dearly 
 needed her sacrifice, she fulfilled her destiny upon earth, "and 
 pleased " the great Task Master," who for happiness or misery, 
 but certainly for good, had given her life. All her gentle 
 eloquence was spent in dissuading llichard from those unkind 
 thoughts towards his species, which the treason of these base 
 men, the caprice of James, the harsh sentence (for this was 
 ao-ain brought home to him by disappointment) of Surrey, 
 awakened in his bosom. It proved no hard task ; soon the 
 princely adventurer, with eagle flight, soared from the sad 
 prostration of spirit, the birth of his disasters, to fresh hopes 
 and lofty resolves. 
 
 It was necessary immediately to prepare for his departure. 
 The earl of Huntley, struck by his magnanimity, no longer 
 opposed his daughter's wish. The English exiles were eager 
 for a new, and, they believed (for untired is hope in man), for 
 a prosperous career. Scotland grew rude, confined, and remote 
 in their eyes. In Ireland were placed for them the portals of 
 the world, to be opened by their swords ; the dancing sea-waves 
 invited them ; the winds of heaven lent themselves to their 
 service. " My friends," said Eichard, " dear and faithful 
 partners of my wayward fortunes, I would fondly believe that 
 we are favoured of Heaven. We are few ; but the evil and 
 the treacherous are no longer among us. And does old Time in 
 all his outworn tales tell any truer, than that the many, being 
 disunited, and so false, have ever been vanquished by the loving, 
 bold, and heroic few ? That a child may scan with its fingers 
 our bare arithmetic, will therefore be to us the source of success, 
 as assuredly it will be of glory. The English were few when 
 they mowed down thickly-planted French at Cressy and 
 Poictiers. Which among us, armed as we are in the mail of 
 valour, but would encounter ten of Tudor's scant-paid mer- 
 cenaries ? For me ! I do believe that God is on my side, as 
 surely as I know that justice and faith are ; and I fear no 
 
 defeat." 
 
 It is thus that man, with fervent imagination, can endue the 
 rouo-h stone with loveliness, forge the misshapen metal into a 
 likeness of all that wins our hearts by exceeding beauty, and 
 breathe into a dissonant trump soul-melting harmonies. The 
 mind of man — that mystery, which may lend arms against itself, 
 teaching vain lessons of material philosophy, but which, in the 
 very act, shows its power to play with all created things, adding

 the sweetness of its own essence to the sweetest, taking its ugli- 
 ness from the deformed. The creative faculty of man's soul — 
 which, animating 'E-ichard, made him see victory in defeat, suc- 
 cess and glory in the dark, the tortuous, the thorny path, which 
 it was his destiny to walk from the cradle to the tomb. 
 
 Oh, had I, weak and faint of speech, words to teach my fellow- 
 creatures the beauty and capabilities of man's mind ; could I, or 
 could one more fortunate, breathe the magic word which would 
 reveal to all the power, which we all possess, to turn evil to 
 good, foul to fair ; then vice and pain would desert the new- 
 born world ! 
 
 It is not thus : the wise have taught, the good suffered for us ; 
 we are still the same ; and still our own bitter experience and 
 heart-breaking regrets teach us to sympathize too feelingly with 
 a tale like this ; which records the various fortunes of one who 
 at his birth received every gift which most we covet ; whose 
 strange story is replete with every change of happiness and 
 misery ; with every contrast of glorious and disgraceful ; who 
 was the noble object of godlike fidelity, and the sad victim of 
 demoniac treason ; the mark of man's hate and woman's love ; 
 spending thus a short eventful life. It is not spent ; he yet 
 breathes : he is on the world of waters. \Vhat new scene unfolds 
 itself.^ Where are they who were false, where those who were 
 true ! They congregate around him, and the car of life bears 
 him on, attended by many frightful, many lovely shapes, to his 
 destined end. He has yet much to suffer ; and, human as he is, 
 much to enjoy.

278 DEPRESSION. 
 
 She grew pale, wlien for the last time she saw the friend of her 
 youth. But Katherine looked upon life in a mode very diflferent 
 from the usual one : the luxuries and dignities of the world 
 never in her mind for a moment came in competition with her 
 affections and her duty ; she saw the plain path before her ; 
 whatever her father's or her royal cousin's idea had been in 
 giving her to the duke of York, she knew that, being his, her 
 destiny upon earth was to share his fortunes, and soothe his 
 sorrows. This constant looking on, giving herself up to, and 
 delighting in one aim, one object, one occupation, elevated her 
 far above the common cares of existence. She left 
 
 -" All meaner things, 
 
 The low ambition and tlie pride of kings," 
 
 — to shroud herself in love ; to take on herself the hallowed 
 state of one devoting herself to another's happiness. Cleopatra, 
 basking in sunny pomp-, borne, the wonder of the world, in her 
 gilded bark, amidst all the aroma of the east, upon the gently- 
 rippling Cydnus, felt neither the pride nor joy of Katherine, as, 
 on the poor deck of their dark weather-beaten skiff, she felt 
 pillowed by the downy spirit of love, fanned by its gentle breath. 
 
 The duke of York was more depressed ; he thought of how, 
 since his miserable childhood, he had been the sport of Fortune 
 and her scorn. He thought of the false, the cold, the perished : 
 a dark wall seemed to rise around him ; a murky vault to close 
 over him : success, glory, honour, the world's treasures, which 
 he had been brought up to aspire to as his dearest aim, his right, 
 were unattainable ; he was the defeated, the outcast ; there was 
 a clog in his way for ever ; a foul taint upon his name. Thus 
 seated on the deck, his arm coiled round a rope, his head leaniug 
 on his arm, while the stars showered a dim silvery radiance, and 
 the sparkling sea mocked their lustre with brighter fires ; while 
 the breeze, that swelled his sail, and drove him merrily along, 
 spent its cold breath on him ; he, painting all natural objects 
 with the obscure colouring suggested by his then gloomy spirit, 
 distorting the very scenery of heaven and vast ocean into 
 symbols of his evil fate, gave himself up to the very luxury of 
 woe, — meanwhile the shadow of a lovely form fell on him, soft 
 fingers pressed the curls of his hair, and Katherine asked, '* Are 
 the nights of Andalusia more glorious than this ? " 
 
 At the voice of the charmer the demon fled ; sky and sea cast 
 off the dim veil his grief had woven, and creation was restored 
 its native beauty. Hitherto the halls of palaces, the gaiety of a 
 court, the council-chamber, had been the scenes in which the 
 princely pair had lived together ; linked to an engrossing state

 of things, surrounded by their partisans, tliey had been friends, 
 nay lovers, according to the love of the many. But solitary 
 Nature is the true temple of Love, where he is not an adjunct, 
 but an essence ; and now she alone was around them, to fill 
 them with sublime awe, and the softest tenderness. In Eichard's 
 eyes, the kingdom of his inheritance dwindled into a mere 
 speck ; the land of her nativity became but a name to Katherine. 
 It sufficed for their two full hearts that they were together on 
 the dark wide sea ; the bright sky above, and calm upon the 
 bosom of the deep. They could ill discern each other in the 
 shadowy twilight ; a dream-like veil was cast over their features, 
 as sleep curtains out tlie soul, so that we look on the beloved 
 slumberer, and say, " He is there, though the mystery of repose 
 wraps me from him ; " so now darkness blinded and divided 
 them : but hand clasped hand ; he felt that one existed who was 
 his own, his faithful ; and she rejoiced in the accomplishment of 
 the master-sentiment of her soul, the desire of self-devotion, 
 self-annihilation, for one who loved her. The passion that 
 warmed their hearts had no fears, no tumult, no doubt. One 
 to the other they sufficed ; and, but that the trance is fleeting, 
 Happiness, the lost child of the world, would have found here 
 her home ; for when love, which is the necessity of affectionate 
 hearts, and the sense of duty, which is the mystery and the law 
 of our souls, blend into one feeling, Paradise has little to promise 
 save immortality. 
 
 For many days this state of forgetful ecstasy lasted. Pian- 
 tagenet and Keville spoke of wars in England ; Lord Barry and 
 Keating of their Irish schemes — the prince listened and replied ; 
 but his soul was far away — Oh, that for ever they might sail 
 thus on the pathless, shoreless sea ! — Nothing mean or trivial or 
 ignoble could visit them ; no hate, no care, no fear — this might 
 not be, but to have felt, to have lived thus for a few short days, 
 suffices to separate mortal man from the groveling part of his 
 nature — no disgrace, no despair can so bring him back to the 
 low-minded world, as to destroy the sense of having once so 
 existed. And Bichard, marked for misery and defeat, acknow- 
 ledged that power which sentiment possesses to exalt us — to 
 convince us that our minds, endowed with a soaring, restless 
 aspiration, can find no repose on earth except in love.

 SIECrE OF -WATERFOED. 
 
 "Now for oiir Irish wars ! " 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 Ag-ain the duke of York approached the rocky entrance of tho 
 Cove of Cork, again he passed through the narrow passage, 
 which opening, displayed a lovely sheet of tranquil water, 
 decked with islands. The arrival of his fleet in the harbour was 
 hailed with joy. Old John O'Water had returned to his civio 
 labours, and had contrived to get himself chosen mayor for this 
 year, that he might be of greater assistance to the White Eose 
 in his enterprise. 
 
 As soon as the arrival of his ships off the coast was known, 
 O'Water despatched messengers] to the earl of Desmond, and 
 busied himself to give splendour to Eichard's entrance into 
 Cork. Tapestry and gay-coloured silks were hung from tho 
 windows ; the street was strewn with flowers — citizens and 
 soldiers intermixed crowded to the landing-place. York's heart 
 palpitated with joy. It was not that thence he much hoped for 
 success to his adventure, which required more than the enthu- 
 siasm of the remote inhabitants of the south of Ireland to 
 achieve it: but Cork was a sort of home to him ; here he had 
 found safety when he' landed, barely escaped from Trangmar's 
 machinations — here he first assumed his rightful name and title 
 — here, a mere boy, ardent, credulous, and bold — he had seen 
 strangers adopt his badge and avouch his cause. Five years had 
 elapsed since then — the acclaim of a few kind voices, the display 
 of zeal, could no longer influence his hopes as then they had 
 done, but they gladdened his heart, and took from it that painful 
 feeling which we all too often experience — that we are cast away 
 on the inhospitable earth, useless and neglected. 
 
 He was glad also in the very first spot of his claimed domi- 
 nions whereon he set foot, to see the Lady Xatherine received 
 with the honours due to her rank. Her beauty and affability 
 won the hearts of all around, and O'Water, with the tenderness

 that an old man is so apt to feel towards a young and lovely 
 woman, extended to her a paternal affection, the simplicity and 
 warmth of which touched her, thrown as she was among strangers, 
 with gratitude. 
 
 Lord Desmond arrived — he was struck by the improvement 
 in York's manner, still ingenuous and open-hearted : he was 
 more dignified, more confident in himself than before — the hus- 
 band of Katherine also acquired consideration ; as an adven- 
 turous boy, he might be used according to the commodity of the 
 hour — now he had place — station in the world, and Desmond 
 paid him greater deference, almost unawares. 
 
 But the earl was sorely disappointed ; " Eeverend Father," 
 said he to Keating, "what aid does Scotland promise? Will 
 they draw Tudor with his archers and harquebussiers, and well- 
 horsed knights, to the north, giving our Irish kern some chance 
 of safe landing in the west ? " 
 
 " Peace is concluded between Scotland and England," replied 
 Keating. 
 
 Desmond looked moody. " How thrives the White Eose 
 over the water ? How sped the duke, when he entered Eng- 
 land ? Some aid somewhere we must have, besides yonder 
 knot of wanderers, and our own hungry, naked kerns." 
 
 " By my fay ! " replied Keating, " every budding blossom on 
 the Eose-bush was nipped, as by a north-east wind. When 
 Duke ^Richard sowed his hopes there, like the dragon's teeth of 
 Dan Cadmus, they turned into so many armed men to attack 
 him." 
 
 " Sooth, good prior," said the earl, with a sharp laugh, "we 
 shall speed well thereby : would you a re-acting of the gleeful 
 mime at Stowe ? " 
 
 " Wherefore," said Keating, " fix your thoughts on England .P 
 The dark sea rolls between us, and even the giants of old broke 
 their causeway, which in the north 'tis said they built, ere it 
 laid its long arm on the English shore. The name of Ireland 
 reads as fair as England ; its sons are as brave and politic, able 
 to defend, to rule themselves : blot England from the world, and 
 Ireland stands free and glorious, sufficing to herself. This 
 springal, valorous though he be, can never upset Tudor's throne 
 in London ; but he can do more for us by his very impotence. 
 He is the true lord of Ireland : we are liegemen in maintaining 
 his right. Plant his banner, rally round it all men who wish well 
 to their country ; drive out the good man Poynings ; crush the 
 Butlers — aye, down with them ; and when Eichard is crowned 
 King of Erin, and the G-eraldines rule under him, our native land 
 will stand singly, nor want England for a crutch — or, by'r Lady !

 for a spear to enter her heart, while she leaneth on it ; so the wars 
 of York and Lancaster may free us from the proud, imperious 
 English ; and the Irish, like the Scotch, have a king and a state 
 of their own." 
 
 Desmond's eyes flashed for a moment, as Keating thus pre- 
 sented before them the picture he most desired to behold ; but 
 they grew cold again. "The means, reverend prior, the arms, 
 the money, the soldiers ? " 
 
 " A bold stroke brings all : strike one blow, and Ireland is at 
 our feet. "We must not tarry ; now the Butlers and their party 
 are asleep in their security ; gather men together ; march forward 
 boldly ; strike at the highest, Dublin herself." 
 
 " Father," replied the earl, " long before I were half way 
 there, my litter would be abandoned even by its bearers, and we 
 left alone among the bogs and mountains, to feed as we may, or 
 die. If there be any sooth in your scheme, it can only prove 
 good, inasmuch as we secure Connaught to ourselves, and turn 
 this corner of the island into a kingdom ; but neither one word, 
 nor one blow, will gain Dublin. You are right so far, — something 
 must be done, and speedily ; and, if it be well done, we may do 
 more, till by the aid of the blessed St. Patrick and white-tooth'd 
 Bridget ! we tread upon the necks of the Butlers." 
 
 This one thing to be undertaken, after much consultation among 
 the chieftains, was the siege of Waterford : it had been sum- 
 moned to acknowledge Duke Richard as its lord, and had refused: 
 Keating was very averse to spending time before a fortified town. 
 "On, on, houtez en avant! " He reminded Lord Barry of his device, 
 and strove to awaken ambition in him. The prior of Kilmainham 
 had spent all his life in Dublin, a chief member of the govern- 
 ment, a seditious, factious but influential man : the capital to 
 him was all that was worth having, while, to these lords of 
 Munster, the smallest victory over their particular rivals, or the 
 gaining a chief city in a district, which was their world, appeared 
 more glorious than entering Loudon itself victoriously, if mean- 
 while Waterford, or any one of the many towns of Ireland, held 
 out against them. 
 
 On the fifteenth of July, 1497, the duke of York, the earl of 
 Desmond, and the other many chief of manj'" names, some 
 Geraldines, all allied to, or subject to them, as the O'Briens, the 
 Koches, the Macarthys, the Barrys, and others, assembled at 
 Youghall, a town subject to the earl of Desmond, and situated 
 about midway between Cork and Waterford, at the mouth of the 
 river Blackwater. 
 
 On the twenty-second of July the army was in movement, 
 and entered the county of Waterford ; the chiefs, at tho

 head of their respective followers, proceeded to the shrine of 
 St. Declan at Ardmore, to make their vows for the success of 
 their expedition. The church at Ardmore, the round tower, 
 the shrine, and healing-rock, were all objects of peculiar sanctity. 
 The countess of Desmond, and her young son, and the fair 
 duchess of York, accompanied this procession from Youghall. 
 After the celebration of mass, the illustrious throng congregated 
 on the rocky eminence, on which the mysterious tower is built, 
 overlooking the little bay, where the calm waters broke gently on 
 the pebblj'' beach. It was a beauteous summer-day ; the noon-day 
 heat was tempered by the sea breeze, and relieved by the 
 regular plash of the billows, as they spent themselves on the 
 shore. A kind of silence — such silence as there can be among 
 a multitude, such a silence as is preserved when the winds sing 
 among the pines — possessed the crowd : they stood in security, 
 in peace, surrounded by such objects as excited piety and awe ; 
 and yet the hopes of the warrior, and, if such a word may be 
 used, a warrior's fears, possessed them ; it was such a pause as 
 the mountain-goat makes ere he commits himself to the pre- 
 cipice. A moment afterwards all was in motion ; to the sound 
 of warlike instruments the troops wound up the Ardmore moun- 
 tains, looking down on the little fleet that stemmed its slow 
 way towards the harbour of Waterford. The ladies were left 
 alone with few attendants. The young duchess gazed on that 
 band of departing warriors, whose sole standard was the spotless 
 rose ; they were soon lost in the foldings of the hills ; again 
 they emerged ; her straining eye caught them. That little 
 speck upou the mountain-side contained the sole hope and joy 
 of her life, exposed to danger for the sake of a little good ; for 
 Katherine, accustomed to the sight of armies, and to the com- 
 panionship of chiefs and rulers, detected at once the small chance 
 there was, that these men could bring to terms a strongly fortified 
 city ; but resignation supplied the place of hope ; she believed 
 that Eichard would be spared ; and, but for his own sake, she 
 cared little whether a remote home in Ireland, or a palace in 
 England received them. She looked again on the mountain 
 path ; no smallest moving object gave sign of life ; the sun- 
 light slept upon the heathy uplands ; the grey rocks stood in 
 shadowy grandeur; Katherine sighed and turned again to the 
 chapel, to offer still more fervent prayers, that on this beauteous 
 earth, beneath this bright genial heaven, she might not be left 
 desolate : whatever else her fortune, that Richard might be hers. 
 The army which the earl of Desmond led against Waterford, 
 did not consist of more than two thousand men. With these he 
 invested the western division of the city. Eichard, with his

 peculiar troop, took Lis position at the extremity of tliis line, 
 nearest Passage, close to Lumbard's Marsh, there to protect the 
 disembarkment of troops from the fleet. 
 
 Neither party failed in zeal or activity. The first days were 
 actively employed in erecting works and bringing the cannon to 
 play upon the town. On the third, in the very midst of their 
 labours, while the earl in his litter was carried close under the 
 walls among the pioneers, and Lord Barry in his eagerness 
 seized a spade and began to work, signals of attack were made 
 from the town, and the troops poured out from the nearest gate. 
 The advanced guard were too few to contend with them ; they 
 were driven back on the entrenchments. The citizens were full 
 of fury and indignation ; they rushed forward with loud cries, 
 and created a confusion, which Desmond and Lord Barry were 
 not slow to encounter ; they brought a few regular troops to 
 stand the assault ; a well pointed cannon from the town swept 
 the thin lines ; they fell back ; a yell of victory was raised by the 
 men of Waterford ; it reached the outpost of Duke Bichard : 
 he, with a score of men, five among them, with himself, being 
 cavaliers armed at all points, were viewing a portion of the walls 
 that seemed most open to assault ; the roar of cannon and the 
 clash of arms called him to more perilous occupation ; he 
 galloped towards the scene of action ; and, while still the 
 faltering men of Desmond were ashamed to fly, yet dared not 
 stand, he, with his little troop, attacked the enemy on their 
 flank. The white steed, the nodding plume, the flashing sword 
 of York were foremost in the fray ; Neville and Plantaganet 
 were close behind ; these knights in their iron armour seemed 
 to the half-disciplined Irish like invulnerable statues, machines 
 to ofiend, impregnable to offence ; twenty such might have 
 turned the fortunes of a more desperate day : their antiigonists 
 fell back. The knight of Kerry led on at this moment a re- 
 inforcement of Geraldines, and a cannon, which hitherto had 
 been rebel to the cannoneer's art, opened its fiery mouth with 
 such loud injurious speech, that for many moments the dread 
 line it traced remained a blank. Bichard saw the post of 
 advantage, and endeavoured to throw himself between the 
 enemy and the city : he did not succeed ; but, on the contrary, 
 was nearly cut off" himself by a reinforcement of townsmen, sent 
 to secure the retreat of their fellows. Those who saw him fight 
 that day spoke of him as a wonder : the heart that had ani- 
 mated him in Andalusia was awake ; as there he smote to death 
 the turbaned Moor, so now he dealt mortal blows on all 
 around, fearless of the pressing throng and still increasing 
 numbers. While thus hurried away by martial enthusiasm,

 tlie sound of a distant trumpet caught his ear, and the echo of 
 lire-arms followed ; it came from the east — his own post was 
 attacked : now, when he wished to retreat, he first discerned 
 how alone and how surrounded he was ; yet, looking on his foes 
 he saw, but for their numbers, how despicable they were ; to a 
 knight, what was this throng of half-armed burghers and naked 
 kerns, who pell-mell aimed at him, every blow ineffectual? But 
 again the loud bellow of distant cannon called him, and he 
 turned to retreat — a cloud of missiles rattled against him ; his 
 shield was struck through ; the bullets rebounded from his case 
 of iron, while his sword felled' au enemy at every stroke ; and 
 now, breaking through the opposing rank on the other side, his 
 friends joined him — the citizens recoiled. " Old Reginald's 
 tower," they averred, " would have bled sooner than these Sir 
 Tristans — they were charmed men, and lead and good arrow- 
 heads were softer than paper-pellets on their sides." The first 
 movement of panic was enough ; before their leaders could rally 
 tliem again to the attack, the English knights were far, riding 
 at full speed towards the eastern gate. 
 
 Here Richard's presence was enough to restore victory to his 
 standard — flushed, panting, yet firm in his seat, his hand true 
 and dangerous in its blows, there was something superhuman in 
 his strength and courage, yet more fearful than his sharp sword. 
 The excess of chivalrous ardour, the burning desire to mingle in 
 the thickest fight, made danger happiness, and all the terrible 
 shows of war entrancing joys to York. When reproached for 
 rashness by his cousin, his bright eye was brighter for a tear, as 
 he cried, " Cousin, I must have some part of my inheritance : 
 my kingdom I shall never gain — glory — a deathless name — oh, 
 must not these belong to him who possesses Xatherine ? The 
 proud Scots, who looked askance at my nuptials, shall avow at 
 least that she wedded no craven-hearted loon." 
 
 With the morrow came a new task. Their little fleet had' 
 made its way up Waterford Harbour into the river Suir ; and 
 the troops destined to join his were partly disembarked. To 
 protect the landing, he and Neville rode across the marsh to the 
 strand. On their return a fresh sight presented itself — the 
 ponds of Kilbarry were filled, the besieged having raised a 
 mound of earth to stop the course of the river which flows from 
 Kilbarry into the Suir ; an(J the road back to their camp was 
 completely cut off*. There was no mode of getting round save 
 by the road to Tramore ; yet to the active mind of Eichard, it 
 seemed that even this disaster might be turned into a benefit. 
 He re-embarked the troops ; he himself went on board the prin- 
 cipal vessel ; he called to secret council the captains : — the con-

 elusion was not immediately divulged, but some adventure of 
 peril was assuredly planned among them. 
 
 The long summer day went slowly down ; the hum of men 
 from Waterford reached the ships ; the quay was thronged with 
 soldiers : several vessels were anchored in the advance, and 
 manned with troops ; but the English fleet, their anchors cast, 
 their sails furled, seemed peacefully inclined. As night came 
 on, the quay became a desert ; the ships were worked back to 
 their former stations. It grew darker ; the city, with its old 
 rough tower and spires, was mirrored indistinctly in the twilight 
 tide ; the walls grew dim and gigantic ; the sound of fire-arms 
 ceased ; the last roll of the drum died away ; the city slept, fear- 
 less of its invaders. At this moment, the ebbing tide began to 
 flow. Assisted by the rising waters, E-ichard and Neville ran a 
 small boat under the cover of the opposite bank of the river, to 
 observe what defences the quay might possess. The low tide at 
 that hour was its best defence ; a watch-tower or two with their 
 sentinels, completed the guard of a part of the town, whose 
 defence on that side was neglected ; by midnight also the tide 
 would have risen, but it was necessary to wait for the following 
 night ; for first he must communicate with Desmond, that a 
 night attack in the opposite direction might efiectually leave the 
 water-side deserted. The vessels meanwhile dropped down below 
 Little Island, at once to get out of shot of Eegiuald's Tower, 
 which commands the harbour, and to remove from the citizens 
 any apprehensions they might entertain of attack. The winding 
 of the river concealed them entirely from the town. 
 
 The next day, a burning August day, declined into a dewy 
 night ; imperceptibly during the dark the vessels were nearer 
 the city ; and while the warders of the city fancied that the 
 troops on board the fleet were finding a circuitous path over 
 land to Desmond's camp, the stars of night twinkled through 
 the shrouds upon decks crowded with men, arming themselves 
 in busy silence. Suddenly it was reported to Richard that a 
 stranger caravel was among them; she was the only vessel 
 with set sails, and these were enlarged by night, till as she 
 neared, she seemed a giant, a living thing stalking between 
 heaven and the element beneath. A sudden shiver convulsed 
 the prince ; to his eye it was the likeness of that vessel which 
 long ere this had traversed, he hoped in safety, the western 
 sea, stemming its mountainous waves towards the beauteous 
 Indian Isles. Had it been wrecked, and this the spectre? 
 It was the illusion of a moment ; but it was necessary to ascer- 
 tain the nature and intentions of the stranger, who was now 
 close among them. York's vessel, at his command, got alongside

 of lier ; he leapt upon the deck, and saw at once liim whom the 
 dim night had concealed before, Hernan de Faro upon the deck. 
 
 A thousand emotions — wonder, fear, delight — rushed into the 
 youth's heart ; while the mariner, yet more weather-beaten, thin 
 to emaciation, but still erect, still breathing the same spirit of 
 fortitude and kindliness, grasped his hand, and blessed the 
 Virgin for the meeting. The questions, the anxiety of E-ichard, 
 could not be uttered in this hour of action ; he only said, " You 
 will join us, and we will be doubly strong ; or must you remain 
 to guard your daughter ? " 
 
 " I come from her — she is not with me — more of this anon." 
 
 Eapidly he asked and obtained information of the meditated 
 attack ; in part he disapproved, and, with all the sagacity of a 
 veteran in such enterprises, suggested alterations. Now every 
 boat was lowered with silent expedition, each received its freight 
 of troops, and was rowed with the tide up the Suir. One skiff 
 contained York and the Moor. The prince, in the anticipation 
 of the hazardous contest, looked serious ; while every feature of 
 De Faro's face was bright, his animated, glad smile, his flashing 
 eyes — all spoke the exhilaration of one engaged in his elected 
 pleasure. !Richard had never seen him thus before : usually he 
 appeared kind, almost deferential ; yet, except when he talked 
 of the sea, heavy and silent, and speaking of that in a subdued 
 tone. He now stood the picture of a veteran hero, self-possessed 
 and calm, but for the joyousness that the very feeling of his 
 sword's weight, as his right hand grasped the hilt, imparted^to 
 his warlike spirit. 
 
 Had an angel, on poised wings of heavenly grain, hovered 
 over the city of Waterford, gazing on its star-pointing spires, 
 the reflecting waters of the-|Suir, the tranquil hills and woods 
 that gathered round the river, he would have believed such quiet 
 inviolate, and blessed the sleep that hushed the miserable pas- 
 sions of humanity to repose. Anon there came the splash of 
 waters, the shout of men, the sentinels' startled cry, the sudden 
 rush of the guard, the clash of swords, the scream, the low 
 groan, the protracted howl, and the fierce bark of the watch-dog 
 joining in. The celestial angel has soared to heaven, scared ; 
 and yet honour, fmagnanimity, devotion, filled the hearts of those 
 who thus turned to hell a seeming paradise. Led by Eichard 
 and De Faro, while a party was left behind to insure retreat, 
 another rushed forward right through the town, to throw open 
 the western gate, and admit Desmond, before the terrified citi- 
 zens had exchanged their nightcaps for helmets ; in vain : 
 already the market-place was filled with soldiers ready for the 
 eLCOunterj guided by a native, they endeavoured to find a

 way throufrli tlie bye-streets ; they lost themselves ; tliey got 
 cntano^led in narrow alleys ; the awakened citizens cast upon 
 their heads tiles, blocks of wood, — all they could lay hands 
 upon. To get back to the square was their only salvation ; 
 although the storm and yell that rose behind, assured 
 them that Desmond had commenced the attack. With dimin- 
 ished numbers York regained the market-place ; here he was 
 furiously attacked : the crowd still increased, until the knot of 
 assailants might have been crushed, it seemed, by mere num- 
 bers ; day, bright day, with its golden clouds and swift-pacing 
 sun, dawned upon the scene. In one of those pauses which 
 sometimes occur in the most chaotic roar, a trumpet was heard, 
 soundinor as it seemed Desmond's retreat from the walls. 
 Kichard felt that he was deserted, that all hope was over ; and 
 to secure the retreat of his men was a work of sufficient diffi- 
 culty. Foot to foot the young hero and the veteran mariner 
 fought ; one by the quickness of his blows, the other by his 
 tower-like strength, keeping back the enemy ; while retreating 
 slowly, their faces to the foe, they called on their men to make 
 good their escape. They reached the quay — they saw the wide 
 river, their refuge ; their vessels near at hand, the boats hover- 
 ing close, their safety was in sight, and yet hope of safety died 
 in theif hearts, so many and so fierce were those who pressed on 
 them, Eichard was wounded, weary, faint ; De Faro alone — • 
 ^Reginald's old tower, which, dark and scathless, frowned on 
 them, seemed his type. They were at the water's edge, and the 
 high tide kissed with its waves the very footway of the quay : 
 " Courage, my lord, — a few more blows and we are safe : " the 
 mariner spoke thus, for he saw Hichard totter ; and his arm, 
 raised feebly, fell again without a stroke. At that moment, a ' 
 flame, and then a bellowing roar, announced that the tardy can- 
 noneer had at last opened his battery on the fleet, from the 
 tower. One glance De Faro cast on his caravel ; the bolt had 
 struck and damaged one of the vessels, but the Adalid escaped, 
 "Courage, my lord ! " again he shouted ; and at that moment a 
 blow was struck at Eichard which felled him ; he lay stretched 
 at De Faro's feet. Ere it could be repeated, the head of the 
 assailant was cleft by a Moorish scimitar. With furious strength, 
 De Faro then hurled his weapon among the soldiers ; the unex- 
 pected act made them recoil ; he lifted up the insensible form of 
 llichard with the power of an elephant ; he cast him into the 
 near waves, and leapt in after : raising him with one hand, he 
 cut the waters with the other, and swam thus towards his vessel, 
 pursued by a rain of missiles ; one arrow glanced on Richard's 
 unstrung helmet, another fixed itself in the joint at the neck ;

 but De Y-dto was unhurt. He passed, swimming thus, the near- 
 est vessels : the sailors crowded to the sides, imploring him to 
 enter: as if it had been schoolboy's sport, he refused, till he 
 reached the Adalid, till his own men raised Kichard, revived 
 now, but feeble, to her worn deck : and he, on board her well- 
 known planks, felt superior to every sovereign in the world.

 MoOre. 
 
 On the height of the tower of Ardmore, the White Eose of 
 young Eichard kept her vigils, and looked across the calm sea, 
 and along the passes of the mountains of Drum, in anxious 
 expectation of the event of the expedition. Sad forebodings 
 oppressed her ; the sentiment that mastered every other, was 
 that her lord should require her presence, her assistance, while 
 she was far. He had promised to send a post each day ; when 
 these failed, her heart sank within her. The only change that 
 occurred, was when she saw the Adalid proceed slowly in the 
 calm towards Waterford. 
 
 One sunny morn she from her watch - tower perceived 
 several stracrglinor orpoups descending the mountains. She 
 strained her eyes : no banners waved ; no martial music spoke 
 of victory. That was secondary in her eyes ; it was for 
 Eiehard's safety that she was solicitous ; yet -she would not, did 
 not fear ; for there is an instinctive sense in human nature which, 
 in time of doubt, sallies forth from the ark of refuge, and 
 brings .back tidings of peace or sorrow to the expectant on the 
 perilous flood; a prophetic spirit which, when it despairs — 
 woe the while ! — the omen proves not false. The Lady Cathe- 
 rine watched anxiously but not in despair. At length heavy 
 footsteps ascended the tower-stairs ; and to answer the beat- 
 ings of her heart, Edmund Plantagenet and the mayor of 
 Cork presented themselves ; they eagerly asked, "Is he not 
 here ? "

 " Nay, he lias not fled ? " she replied, while for the first 
 time she grew pale. 
 
 " Weigh our words as mere air," said O'Water ; " for we 
 know nothing, gentle dame, but that I must to Cork, to bar 
 out the men of Waterford. His highness left us for the fleet ; 
 and the filling up of those cursed ponds of Kilbarry — ill luck to 
 them ! — cut off his return. Last night — Saint Patrick knows the 
 deeds of the last night ! — weary from our labour the day before, 
 we were all too carelessly asleep, when our camp was assaulted. 
 Earl Maurice had ridden to Lismore to hasten his cousin, the 
 Knight of the Valley. There was some report of 'an attack 
 upon the town from the ships. Havoc was the cry that roused 
 the welkin from east to west. The sum I know not, save that 
 we are runaways — the siege of Waterford is raised." 
 
 " What skiff is that ? " interrupted the duchess. Eound 
 the point of Minehead first peeped the bowsprit, then the prow ; 
 and last the complete form of a vessel in full sail, yet scarcely 
 touched by the wind, weathered the promontory. " Haste we, 
 my friends," she continued ; " the duke may be on board ; at 
 least we shall have intelliijence." 
 
 " I know that craft full well," said O'Water ; " her captain is 
 a converted Moorish pagan." 
 
 " The White Rose waves from her mast-top," cried Xathcrine ; 
 " oh, he is there ! " 
 
 " Holy angels ! " exclaimed Edmund ; " it is the Adalid ! I 
 will on board on the instant." 
 
 Already the duchess was descending the steep narrow stairs ; 
 the villagers of Ardmore, with many of the soldiers who had 
 fled from Waterford, were on the shingles, watching the cara- 
 vel, now full in sight, yet fearful to venture too near the 
 shelving shore. " They are bound for Cork," cried a man. 
 
 " Oh, not till I first "speak to them," said Katherine ; " the 
 day is fair, the sea calm, put off a boat. Ah, my cousin Ed- 
 mund, take me with thee." 
 
 Plantagenet had already got a boat from its moorings. 
 O'Water was beside the princess to beseech vainly that she 
 would be patient; and poor Astley, who had been left in 
 special attendance on her, waited near with blanched- cheeks. 
 Accompanied by these dear or humble friends, the White Eose 
 was borne with the speed of ten oars towards the Adahd. Ou 
 the deck, half reclining on a rude bed, very pale, yet with 
 lively, wakeful eyes, lay the prince of England. In a moment 
 Katherine was assisted on board. There was no death for 
 Eichard ; she was there, life of his life ; so young, so beautiful, 
 and true ; the celestial goodness that beamed in her eyes, and

 dimpled her clierub countenance, was not like that of an inha- 
 lant of this sad planet ; except that spirits of beauty and love 
 ever and anon do animate the frames of the earth-born; so that 
 we behold in the aspects of our fellow-beings glances and smiles 
 brifrht as those of ano^els. De Faro himself looked with admi- 
 ration on the bending form of this lovely one, till accosted by 
 Edmund, whose first question was, *' Don Hernau here — where 
 then is " 
 
 " My beloved Monina you would ask for," said De Faro ; 
 " she, who to please her vagrant father would have crossed the 
 wild Atlantic to visit the savage Western Isles. Poor child, 
 even at the threshold of this adventure we were nearly wrecked. 
 She is now in England ; she sent me. here — to tell of rebel- 
 lion against King Henry ; to invite Duke Hichard to his 
 kingdom." 
 
 Thus they were occupied on the sunny deck ; the sea was 
 calm, the keel almost stationary in the water ; they were bound 
 for Cork ; Plantageuet and the mayor gathered eagerly from De 
 Earo the history of the combat. They learned that it had been 
 expected that Desmond would have assaulted from land, while 
 York invaded the city from the river ; but the fellow sent with 
 [Richard's missive had been taken, the city put on her guard. 
 Nothing but the desire of the citizens to do too much, and his 
 own desperate valour, had saved Eichard ; they resolved at 
 once to receive and destroy him, and to sally unawares on the 
 earl's camp : they hoped to make prisoners of all the chiefs. 
 They failed in this, but succeeded in raising the siege of their 
 city. 
 
 Towards evening a land-breeze sprung up, and two others of 
 York's vessels hove in sight, and passed them quickly ; for the 
 Adalid was much disabled, and made slow way. Soon in pur- 
 suit appeared a ship and two corvettes, which O'Water recog- 
 nized as belonging to Waterford. The corvettes proceeded on 
 their way ; but the larger vessel spied out the Adalid, and, 
 being now in advance of her, hove to, with the manifest resolve 
 of attacking her on her watery way towards Cork. De Earo, 
 with his keen eyes fixed on the enemy's movements, stood on the 
 forecastle in silence; while Plantageuet and O' Water eagerly de- 
 manded arms, and exhorted the sailors to a most vain resistance. 
 Erom the vessel of the foe the Moorish mariner cast his eyes 
 upwards ; the wind was shifting to the west. With a loud voice 
 he shouted to his crew to man the yards ; then, seizing the 
 rudder, gave the swift orders that made the caravel go about. 
 Sailing near the wind, her canvass had flapped lazily, now it 
 filled ; the keel felt the impulse, and dashed merrily along,

 boundiuf^ forward like a courser in the race ; the sbip, which 
 had furled its sails in expectation of the combat, was in an 
 instant left far behind ; the other vessels from Waterford were 
 still further to the west, towards Cork. 
 
 All these manoeuvres were mysteries to the landsmen : they 
 gladly hailed the distance placed between them and a superior 
 enemy ; but as with a freshening gale the Adalid still held her 
 swift course towards the east, and the land began to sink on the 
 horizon, O'Water asked with some eagerness whither they were 
 bound. 
 
 " To safety," De Faro replied, laconically. 
 
 " An idle answer," said Edmund ; " we must judge where our 
 safety lies ? " 
 
 " I have ever found best safety on the wide ocean sea," cried 
 the mariner, looking round proudly on his beloved clement. 
 " Your safeties and your lords are, methiuks, English born ; 
 if this wind hold, on the third morning we shall see the coast of 
 Cornwall." 
 
 The mayor was aghast, exclaiming — " Cornwall ! England ! 
 we are betrayed ? " 
 
 De Faro looked on him with contempt : — " I do not command 
 here," he continued, " I obey the prince of England ; let him 
 decide. Shall we engage superior force ; be boarded ; taken by 
 the enemy : or land, be wrecked, perchance, upon this savage 
 coast ; alive with vengeful kerns — defeated men among a victo- 
 rious angry people ? Or go where we are called by your leader's 
 cause, where thousands of men are up in arms to receive you 
 like brothers, to fight for you, with you ; where England, the 
 long-desired kingdom, makes you welcome to her green, sunny 
 shores ? Ask ye your prince this question ; let his word be 
 law." 
 
 This statement, upheld by York, brought conviction to the 
 minds of Plautagenet and O'Water. The latter was aware of 
 the risk he ran from the awakened vengeance of Henry, to 
 pursue his having fostered rebellion in the city of which he was 
 magistrate ; and a moment's reflection showed him that there 
 was no security for him, except in flight from Ireland. Mean- 
 while the wind, increasing in its strength, and right astern, 
 carried them over the foaming waters. The early dawn showed 
 them far at sea : they had outrun or baffled their pursuers ; 
 and though, now and then, with anxious thought, they reflected 
 on the comrades left behind, on the poor equipage, and 
 diminished numbers with which they were about to land in 
 England, still there was something so miraculous in their 
 escape, 80 unforeseen in the destiny that cut them off, and

 carried them, a remnant merely of tlie war, away from its 
 dangers, that they felt as if they were under the immediate 
 direction of a ruling Providence, and so resigned themselves ; 
 greedily drinking in the while the highly coloured picture De 
 Faro painted of the Yorkist army which awaited them in 
 Cornwall. 
 
 Again upon the sea — again impelled by winds and waves to 
 new scenes — new hopes, tossed here and there by Fortune, it was 
 Eichard's fate to see one frustrated expectation give place to 
 another, which, in its turn, faded and died. This constant 
 succession of projects kept alive within him that sanguine spirit 
 which never could be vanquished. Eagerly he passed from one 
 idea to another, and almost welcomed the last disaster, which 
 appeared but to pioneer the way to future success. During this 
 voyage, weak as his wounds had made him, he talked of 
 England as his own — the dearer because he must spend his 
 blood to win it. Circumstances had an exactly contrary effect 
 upon Katherine. The continual change of schemes convinced 
 her of the futility of all. She felt that, if the first appearance 
 of the duke of York, acknowledged and upheld by various 
 sovereigns and dear high-born relatives, had not animated the 
 party of the White Hose in his favour, it was not now, after 
 many defeats and humiliations on his side, and after triumphs 
 and arrogant assumptions on that of his enemy, that brilliant 
 success could be expected. This conviction must soon become 
 general among the Yorkists, Richard would learn the sad lesson, 
 but she was there to deprive it of its sting ; to prove to him, 
 that tranquillity and Ivatherine were of more worth than 
 struggles, even if they proved successful, for vain power. 
 
 It was strange that a girl of royal birth, bred in a palace, 
 accustomed to a queen-like sovereignty over her father's nu- 
 merous vassals in the Highlands, should aim at restricting the 
 ambitious York to mere privacy; while Monina, the humble 
 daughter of a Moorish mariner, would have felt honour, repu- 
 tation, all that is dear to man, at stake, if her friend had 
 dreamed of renouncing his claims to the English crown. His 
 cause was her life ; his royalty the main spring of all her 
 actions and thoughts. She had sacrificed love to it — she 
 taught her woman's soul to rejoice in his marriage with 
 another, because his union with a princess was pledge to the 
 world of his truth. Perhaps, had the time ever come when he 
 renounced his struggles, she had felt with a pang that his lowly 
 fortunes might not incongruously be shared by her, and self 
 had mingled in the religion of her heart, which was virtuous 
 devotion to him ; but as it was, the idea never presented itself.

 He must ^vin or die. Did lie win, her happiness would result 
 from the contemplation of his glorj ; were he to die, the young 
 hero's grave would not be watered by her tears : she believed 
 that in that hour her life would cease. 
 
 The Lady Katherine saw a vain mask in all the common-place 
 pomp of palaces ; she perceived that power failed most when its 
 end was good ; she saw that in accomplishing its purpose in the 
 cottage, or in halls of state, felicity resulted from the affections 
 only. It was but being an actor in different scenes, to be a 
 potentate or a peasant ; the outward garb is not the livery of 
 the mind : the refinement of taste which enables us to gather 
 pleasure from simple objects ; the warmth of heart which neces- 
 sitates the exercise of our affections, but which is content when 
 they are satisfied ; these, to her mind, were the only, but they 
 were the complete ingredients of happiness ; and it was rarer 
 to find and more difficult to retain them, among false-hearted, 
 ambitious courtiers, and the luxury of palaces, than among 
 simple-minded peasantry and a plain natural style of living. 
 There was some romance in this idea ; Katherine felt that there 
 was, and subdued herself not to lay too much store by any 
 change or guise of outward circumstance. She taught herself 
 to feel -and know, that in the tumult of camps and war, in the 
 anxieties of her present vagrant life, on the throne which she 
 might possess, or in the prison she might share, by devoting 
 herself to the happiness of him to whom she was united, 
 whose heroism, goodness and love merited all her affection, 
 she was performing the part assigned to her on earth, and 
 securing a portion of happiness, far beyond the common lot of 
 those whose colder, harder natures require something beyond 
 sympathy to constitute their misnamed felicity.

 On tlie deck of the sea-worn Adalid, Tvatcliing the renovated 
 strength, and attending on the still remaining weakness of her 
 lord, the soft heart of the princess possessed to fulness all its 
 desires ; while Monina, among the wild rude Cornish rebels, 
 exerted herself to inspire zeal for his cause, and to increase the 
 number of his partisans, winning them by her thrilling 
 eloquence, ruling them by her beauty and enthusiasm. She had 
 found the whole population ready to second him ; but fitting 
 leaders, noble and influential men, were absolutely wanting. 
 She sent her father to urge Hichard to this new attempt, and 
 when he should appear, attended, as she fondly hoped, by a 
 train of high-born Irish lords, of gallant Scotch cavaliers, and 
 devoted English warriors ; he would be able to give a martial 
 form to the rout of Cornish insurgents, to discipline their wild, 
 untamed valour, to attract others by name and rank, and Tudor 
 at last must grow pale upon his throne. With eagerness she 
 awaited the fleet that was to bring the chosen band of heroes ; 
 when, after a long and calm voyage, on the third of September, 
 the Adalid ran into White Sand Bay, on the western coast of 
 Cornwall, and Plantagenet, at Eichard's command, disembarked 
 and proceeded forthwith to Bodmin. 
 
 It was strange that the chief partizan of the White Eose 
 should, on his invasion of the island, find a Spanish girl the main 
 source of information — the chief mover of the reb.ellion by 
 which he was to profit. Yet Plantagenet almost forgot his 
 mortal struggle for a kingdom, in the anticipation of seeing 
 Monina. Plantagenet, prouder, more ambitious for his cousin 
 than Eichard for himself — Plantagenet, who had but one object, 
 to be the guardian, supporter, defender of York, now wandered 
 in thought far back through many years to their Spanish home ;

 to bis tenderness for the sweet cliild of Madeline ; to the 
 development of the beauty and virtues of the lovely Moor. 
 ThroTvn apart by their several destinies, he had scarcely seen 
 her since then ; and now, in place of the dark, laughing-eyed 
 girl, he beheld a woman, bright with intelligence and sensibility ; 
 whose brow wore somewhat th« sad trace of suffering, whose 
 cheek was a little sunk, but in whose eyes there was a soul, in 
 whose smile an enchantment not to be resisted. She was all 
 life, vivacity, and yet softness : all passion, yet yielding and 
 docile. Her purpose was steady, stubborn ; but the mode of 
 its attainment, her conduct, she easil}^ permitted to be guided. 
 Edmund scarcely recognized her, but she instantly knew him ; 
 her elder brother, her kind but serious guardian, whom she 
 had loved with awe, as the wisest and best of men. Now he 
 bore a dearer name, as the unfailing friend of him she loved. 
 To both their hearts this meetiug was an unexpected joy. 
 Monina had thought too much of Eichard to remember his 
 cousin. He had half forgotten his own sensations ; or, at 
 least, was quite unprepared for the power and effect of her 
 surpassing beauty. 
 
 After the first overflowing of affection, Monina eagerly 
 detailed the forces raised, and dwelt on the spirit and courage 
 of the insurgents. " They are poor fellows," she said, "but 
 true; burning with zeal to right themselves, and to avenge 
 their losses at Blackheath. They are gathered together by 
 thousands. They want merely leaders, discipline, arms, money, 
 ammunition, and a few regular troops to show them the way : 
 these, of course, you bring." 
 
 " Alas ! no," said Edmund, " we bring merely ourselves." 
 
 *' Could Ireland, then, furnish no warlike stores ? " con- 
 tinued the zealous girl, "But this can be remedied, doubtless. 
 Yourself, your leader, Lord Desmond, Lord Barry, the gallant 
 Neville ; tell me who else — who from Burgundy — what Irish, 
 "what Scottish knights ? " 
 
 The last word was said with diflSculty : it made a pause in her 
 rapid utterance ; while Edmund, aghast, replied, " Indeed ! 
 none of all these, or very few : in a word, we have fled from 
 Waterford in the Adalid. His highness and myself are the 
 sole English knights. The good old mayor of Cork must 
 represent all Ireland, gentle and simple, to your eyes— ^our fair 
 duchess, Scotland : her attendants will follow in due time, but 
 these are but needy servitors." Monina laughed. " We came 
 to seek, not bring aid," continued Plantagenet, gravely. 
 
 " Do not be angry," replied Monina. " There is more bitter- 
 ness and sorrow in my laugh, than in, piethiuks, a widow's tears,

 My dear friend, God send vre are not utterly lost. Yet his 
 highness and yourself may work wonders. Only report truly 
 our state, that the duke be not too dissatisfied with our appear- 
 ance. Tell him Lord Audley headed a worse organized troop : 
 tell him that Master Heron, the mercer, has no silken soul — that 
 Master Skelton, the tailor, disdains a smaller needle than a 
 cloth-yard shaft." 
 
 *' And is it to head men like these we have been drawn from 
 our Irish friends ?" cried Edmund ; " better return. Alas ! our 
 path is besieged ; the very sea is subject to our enemy ; in the 
 wide world the king of England has no refuge." 
 
 " That he is king of England," said Monina, "let not him, 
 let none of us forget. The very name is powerful : let him, 
 on his native shores, assume it. Surely, if their liege king 
 stand singly in the land of his forefathers, at his sacred name 
 thousands will congregate. He has dared too little, when he 
 had power : at the worst, even now, let him dare all, and 
 triumph." 
 
 Her bold, impetuous language had its effects on Edmund; it 
 eclioed his own master passion, which ever cried aloud, " He is 
 a king ! and, once give himself that sacred name, submission 
 and allegiance from his subjects must follow." Buoyed up by 
 these thoughts, his report on board the Adadid was free from 
 those humiliating details, which, even if he had wished, he 
 would have found no voice to communicate to his royal cousin. 
 
 Monina's task .of imparting to her friends the destitute con- 
 dition in which their sovereign arrived, was even easier. " He 
 is come among tall men," said the pompous Heron, **who 
 can uphold him for the better king, even to the satin of his 
 doublet." 
 
 " And fight for him, even to the rending of our own," cried 
 Skelton. 
 
 " And die for him, as he must too, when all's done," said 
 Trcreife. "A soldier's death is better than a dastard's life." 
 
 " We will have our men in goodly array," said Heron. 
 " Master Skelton, are the doublets cut from that piece of 
 sad-coloured velvet, last of my wares, slashed with white, as I 
 directed?" 
 
 " Slash me no doublets but with a Spanish rapier," squeaked 
 Skelton, " Have I not cast away the shears ? Yet, look you 
 now, good lack ! I lie. Here in my pouch be a sharp pair, to 
 clip Master Walter of Horneck's ears — if, by the help of the 
 saints, we can lay him as flat on the field as Jiis own grey suit 
 was en my board when a shaping ; by the same token that he 
 never paid for it,"

 "In good hour, Sir Taylor," said Monina : "but tlie talk 
 now is, how duly to receive his grace, how induce him to accept 
 your aid." 
 
 " Ay, by Saint Dunstan!," cried Trereife, "he has ruffled in 
 France] and Burgundy, my masters, and will look on you as 
 clowns and base-born burghers ; but no man has more to give 
 than his life, and if he waste that heartily, time was, and time 
 may be, when villains trod on the necks of knights, as the ghost 
 of Charles of Burgundy could tell us. Courage is the beginning 
 and end of a soldier's catechism." 
 
 Such were the chiefs Monina found desirous, and in their own 
 conceit capable, of placing England's diadem on Duke Richard's 
 head. Heron, the bankrupt mercer, who fancied himself the 
 base-born offspring of the late earl of Devonshire, and whose 
 first deed of arms would find him Heron no more, but Sir John 
 Courtney ; Skelton, a luckless wight, whose shears ever went 
 astray (the true cause why Walter of Hornbeck paid not for his 
 misshapen suit), and who, therefore, believed himself born for 
 greater things ; and Trereife, the younger prodigal son of a 
 rural Franklin, who, cast off and disinherited, had served in the 
 wars. in Flanders, gaining in that country no small reverence for 
 the good Duchess Margaret, and ready therefore to right her 
 nephew ; besides, like a true hero, he abhorred this silken time 
 of peace, and hoped to gather spoil, if not laurels, in the 
 meditated insurrection. 
 
 The noble passengers disembarked from the Adadid. " Wel- 
 come to England, sweet Kate ! welcome to the country of 
 which thou art queen," said York ; " and even if her reception 
 be cold or rough, love her for my sake, for she is my mother." 
 
 " A stepmother I will not call her, dear my lord," replied the 
 princess, " but the maternal embrace is strangely wanting on 
 these deserted sands : the narrow deck of yonder caravel, were, 
 methinks, a kindlier home : may we go on and prosper ; but, if 
 we fail, my lord will pardon me, if I welcome the day when I 
 embark again on board the Adadid ; to find, when the wide 
 earth proves false, safety and happiness on the free waves of 
 ocean."

 These dougbty leaders drew out their followers in a plain just 
 without Bodmin. There were about two hundred men decently 
 clad from the remnants of the mercer's wares, tolerably well 
 armed and disciplined by Trereife ; this troop obtained the 
 distinction of being selected as King E-ichard's body-guard. 
 Skelton was their captain, a rare commander, whose real merit 
 was that he felt happiest when stuck close as a burr to Trereife ; 
 for at heart he was an arrant coward, though a loud braoriiart, 
 and talked of slaying his thousands, while the very wounding of 
 his doublet had made him wince. 
 
 Heron was brave in his way ; a true Cornishman, he could 
 wrestle and cast his antagonist with the strength of a lion ; he 
 loved better, it is true, to trust to his arm than to his sword, 
 which, in spite of his strength, Trereife always made fly from 
 liis hand in their fencing lessons ; not the less did he consider 
 himself a gallant knight, and had cut up many a yard of crimson 
 cramoisy to make a rich suit for himself. He wore Monina's 
 glove in his cap and large yellow roses at his knees ; he called 
 himself generalissimo, and marshalled under him full three 
 thousand men, who in truth had

 wortli, whicli was even nothing to them, who had laboured with 
 all their hearts, till labour was of no avail, and who then left the 
 mine and the furrow to carry their loud complaints to the foot 
 of Henry's throne — they were better pleased with the prospect 
 of overthrowing it. 
 
 *' Now, ray masters, make yourselves heard," cried Heron, as 
 he shuffled down a little eminence on a short-legged TV'elsh 
 pony, the only steed he found he could back in safety. " His 
 grace is within ear-shot, so you be loud. Long life to King 
 llichard I — down with the taxes — Saint Michael and Cornwall 
 for ever !" 
 
 The din was prolonged, ended, began, went on, as the prince 
 arrived at the summit of the hill with his little train — fair 
 Katherine was at his side — Plantaganet, O' Water, De Faro, 
 with some dozen soldiers who fled from Waterford ; sure never 
 invader came so ill equipped. On the hill-top the illustrious 
 wanderers paused, llichard hastily scanned the rough-suited 
 multitude — then, turning to Plantagenet, " Cousin," he said, 
 " you told me that the insurgent army would be drawn out for 
 my view ; is it not strange that yonder rabble should hide it 
 from us ? As far as my eye can reach, I see no martial dis- 
 cipline, no banners, no lordly crest ; fie on those drums ! they 
 have no touch of military concord. What makes our army so 
 slack of duty, cousin ?" 
 
 Though no fault of his, Edmund blushed deeply in very 
 shame — the approach of Heron, Skelton, Trereife, and three or 
 four other principal rebels, cut off his reply. It had been 
 agreed that Skelton, who had a gift of eloquence, should speak, 
 and many words he used to welcome his liege. " We will have 
 every man with a red rose in his cap, in a drag chain, please 
 your grace, and give a sound lesson to the saucy burghers of 
 Exeter withal. Not a knight shall live in the land, but of your 
 majesty's dubbing. AVe have but to put to rout King Henry's 
 army, to hang the false loon for a traitor, and to set fire to 
 London and the Parliament. Such nobles as please to doff 
 their silken cloaks, and don miners' jackets, may work, the rest 
 shall hancr. Their mere wardrobes, bless the dav ! will find us 
 and your grace in cloth of gold, embroidery, and other rich 
 garniture to the end of our lives." 
 
 " We thank your zeal, my worthy master," said Richard, 
 courteously ; *' if our good troops do half your saying, King 
 Henry must look- to it." 
 
 " Are those men to be worse than their word ?" cried Skelton. 
 " There is not one among us but has the arms of ten. We 
 are of a race of giantSj please your majesty, and could knock

 the walls of Exeter down with, our fists. Please you to enter 
 Bodmin, whose very stones will cry for King Richard louder 
 than King Hal's cannon ; — to-morrow, God willing, we are for 
 the wars." 
 
 The royal party passed on — the dark ferocity or sturdy 
 obstinacy painted on the faces of the ill-armed rout, struck 
 Richard as he passed — he became meditative, while Edmund, 
 shamed and angry, his cheeks burning, his eyes on the ground, 
 listened in indignant silence to Master Skelton, who fastened on 
 him with such talk, that whether a soldier spoke of killing 
 doublets, or a tailor prattled of fashioning a field of slaughter, 
 was a riddle ill to be devised. At length they passed the gates 
 of Bodmin ; and here was a louder cry of welcome from the 
 shrill voices of women, who held up their thin hands and half- 
 starved children, crying for vengeance on Tudor, blessing the 
 sweet faces of Richard and his lovely wife. York's eyes flashed 
 again with their wonted fires ; his creative spirit had found 
 materials here to work some project, all poor and rude as they 
 might seem. 
 
 They entered the town-hall ; when, by some sudden revulsion, 
 in the tide of the crowd, every Cornishman fell back, closed the 
 doors, and left the wanderers alone. Something was forgotten 
 surely ; for Heron had paced pompously up to Richard, when 
 suddenly he turned on his heel, 'crying, " A word, my masters ! " 
 and all were gone. The Lady Katherine had marked their 
 backing and hurrying with becoming gravity ; but, when the 
 door was fairly shut, she could restrain no longer a heart-felt 
 laugh. Richard joined in her mirth, while Plantagenet strode 
 through the hall angrily ; muttering, " an army, a rout of 
 shirtless beggars ; is this England's reception for her king ? " 
 
 " It were fine mumming," said Richard, " under a hedge with 
 the green sward for a stage." 
 
 " By our Lady, this passes patience ! " reiterated Edmund ; 
 " where are the gentlemen of England ? Where the sons of 
 those who fell for York? Are we to oppose these half-naked 
 knaves to the chivalry of Henry ? " 
 
 " It would seem that such is expected," replied the prince ; 
 " and, verily, cousin, we might do worse. I pray you, treat the 
 honest rogues well ; better may come of it ; keep we our secret, 
 and have we not an array ? " 
 
 " My lord ! " cried Plantagenet, in wonder. 
 
 " Patience, dear friend," said York ; " I have not been appren- 
 tice to adversity so many long years, without becoming an adept 
 in my calling. I say, I have an army ; bold, though poor — 
 ragged truly, but exceeding faithful. Methinks it were more

 glorious to put Tudor down -with such suiall means, than to 
 meet him in equal terms, like a vulc^ar conqueror. I do beseech 
 you, Edmund, put a good face on it ; speak to our Cornish 
 giants, as if they had souls of mettle, and bodies decked like 
 Ponce de Leon and his peers, when they welcomed Queen Isabel 
 to the Spanish camp. You remember the golden array of the 
 knights, cousin P " 
 
 Edmund was impatient of the prince's gay humour ; while 
 Catherine, seeing in his bright eyes heroism and lofty resolve, 
 felt a dewy moisture gather in her own : there is something at 
 once awful and affecting, when a man, the sport of fortune, 
 meets her rudest blow unshrinking, and turns her very spite 
 into arms against herself. The whole secret of Richard's pre- 
 sent thoughts she could not divine, but she saw that their scope 
 was worthy of his birth, his aim : her respect — her love aug- 
 mented ; and her gentle heart at that moment renewed its vow 
 to devote herself to him entirely and for ever. 
 
 In the same spirit, York answered the deputation that waited 
 on him. He commanded a proclamation to be made, in which 
 he assumed the title of Eichard the Fourth. He announced 
 his intention of immediately penetrating England, and seizing 
 on some walled town or city, before Henry could be aware of 
 his having landed. Nor did he coDfine his energy to words ; he 
 examined the state of his men ; their arms and furniture ; he 
 provided for their better discipline, and animated his cousin to 
 take an active part in marshalling them to order. He went 
 among them, learned the causes of their dissatisfaction, pro- 
 mised them better days, and so raised a glad spirit in them, that 
 their hearts, overleaping both time and circumstance, paid him the 
 honour and the love he might have claimed, had he already led 
 them through fertile England, and planted his victorous standard 
 on the Tower of London. Trereife swore by his beard, he was 
 a proper youth ; the old soldier awoke to the remembrance 
 of harvests of spoil he had gathered in the Netherlands, the 
 stern encounters and the joys of success ; he gazed on the rough 
 Cornish men, and wondered how they should withstand the 
 nobility of England : but, when Eichard glanced hope and 
 triumph from his bright eyes, when he spoke of the omnipotence 
 of resolved valour, when he drew a picture of their ghastly 
 poverty, and showed them how, by standing firm merely, they 
 might redeem themselves ; — -ohile the poor fellows answered 
 with a prolonged shout, or better still, grasped their arms more 
 fiercely, and trod the earth with free and decided steps ; — a 
 thousand facilities seemed to be discovered ; a thousand resources 
 for the war displayed, undreamt of before. Were these mere

 TTords ? or at his voice did soldiers rise from the clods, and 
 victory obey the sound ? 
 
 Plantagenet, seeing his royal cousin's resolve, strove to second 
 it. With a party of men he assaulted a near fortress, carried it, 
 and seized on a store of arms. This success looked like a mighty 
 victory ; Richard exalted it as such ; and the very fellows who 
 handled awkwardly their booty, fancied themselves heroes at the 
 mere sight of it. 
 
 On the third day they were to proceed to Exeter, it being 
 determined that they should besiege this city. De Faro offered 
 to sail to Cork to invite the warlike chieftains of Munster to 
 come over with their power ; and at least himself to bring back 
 in the Adalid, JSTeville, and the rest of the English exiles. While 
 Edmund, who looked glad at the thought, counselled that they 
 should entrench themselves in this corner of England, which was 
 so entirely devoted to them, till these forces were added to their 
 number, and till by discipline, they should have made regular 
 troops of the rabble, by courtesy y'cleped an army. 
 
 "Wherefore, cousin," asked Richard, " do you desire others 
 to share in our disasters ? " 
 
 " My lord ! " cried Edmund, astounded. 
 
 "I have but one wish," continued the prince, " that you and 
 my good O'Water were even now in Ireland ; so that I might 
 stand the brunt of this war alone. You look amazed. Yet it 
 were more amazing if I expected to do battle against the Veres, 
 the Howards, the Berkeleys, the Courtneys, and ten thousand 
 other names of high renown, backed by their train of martial 
 adherents, with ragged regiments like those we are about to 
 lead to the field ; — even though the kerns of Ireland made 
 their number double, and the Geraldines, Barry and Neville 
 added by their nobleness dignity to our victor's conquest. 
 Remember Stoke, my cousin Edmund ; you may well remember 
 it. Remember my honoured kinsman the earl of Lincoln and 
 my lamented Lovel. Ah ! that I did not now peril your life, 
 then spared ! " 
 
 " Yet, if your grace fight at all," said O'Water, bluntly ; 
 "methinks we were not the worse for being better appointed 
 for the fray. For victims, even those poor honest varlets are 
 too many." 
 
 " That one other life should be wasted for me," replied 
 Richard, fervently, " is my saddest thought. I fear it must be 
 so ; some few lives, each as dear to him that spends it, as is the 
 life-blood to our own hearts, I can say no more. I have a 
 secret purpose, I confess, in all I do. To accomplish it — and 
 I do believe it to be a just one — I must strike one blow -, nor

 fail. Tudor is yet unprepared ; Exeter vacant of garrisoil ; with 
 stout hearts for the work, I trust to be able to seize that city. 
 Tiiere the wars of York shall end. So far I confide in your 
 discretions, that you may not deem me mad. More is the sinj^le 
 property of my own soul. Will you help me so far, dear friends — 
 so far hazard life — not to conquer a kingdom for Eichard, but to 
 redeem his honour? " 
 
 The warm-hearted, grey-headed Irish O'Water, with gushing 
 eyes, swore to adhere to him the last. 
 
 Edmund replied, " I am but a bit of thee ; deal with me as 
 with thyself ; and I know thou wilt be no niggard in giving me 
 away to danger." 
 
 De Earo cried, '* I am a sailor, and know better how to face 
 death on the waves than victory on shore ; but, Santiago ! may 
 our blessed Lady herself look shy on me at the great day, if the 
 mariner of the wreck prove false to your grace." 
 
 " Now then to our work," cried York, " to speak fair to my 
 faithful fellows and their braggart leaders. They at least shall 
 be winners in our game ; for my hand is on my prize ; a spirit 
 has whispered success to me ; my hope and its consummation 
 are married even at their birth."

 lliCHAUD was obliged to plead his cause yet once again. 
 Katherine had watched all his movements ; she had eyed 
 curiously the army he mustered to the field : she talked to its 
 leaders, and while they vaunted her affability, she was diving 
 with earnest mind, into the truth of things. No fear that it 
 could be hid from her ; love for Hichard was the bright light 
 that dispelled every deceptive shadow from the scene. She saw

 clianics, vrliose swords were more apt to cut tliemselves than 
 strike the enemy, were arrayed against the whole power and 
 majesty of England. On the morrow they were to set forward. 
 That night, while at the casement of his rude chamber, Eichard 
 gazed upon the congregated stars, trying to decipher in their 
 intricate bright tracery the sure omen of the good he was told 
 they charactered for him, Eatherine, after a moment's hesitation, 
 with a quivering voice, and hand that shook as it pressed his, 
 knelt on a cushion at his feet, saying, " My sweet Richard, hear 
 me ; hear your faithful friend — your true wife ; call not my 
 councils weak and feminine, but weigh them sagely ere you 
 resolve. May I speak ?" 
 
 " Lady of my heart, arise," said Eichard ; " speak, my soft- 
 voiced Katherine — my White Eose of beauty — fair flower, crown- 
 ing York's withered tree. Has not God done all in giving you 
 to me ? yet we must part, love, for a while. Your soldier is for 
 the wars, Kate, while you sit in your bower, weaving victorious 
 garlands for his return." 
 
 *• My ever dear lord," said Katherine, " I speak with fear, 
 because I feel that I shall not address myself to your concealed 
 thought. I do not Avish to penetrate your secrets, and yet I 
 tremble at their event. You have not so far deceived yourself 
 as to imagine, that with these unfortunate men you can ride 
 over the prfde and the power of this island ; did I see on what 
 else you founded the lofty hope, that has, since we came here, 
 beamed in your eyes, I would resign myself to your better 
 wisdom. But, wherever I turn my view, there is a blank. You 
 do not dream of conquest, though you feel secure of victory. 
 What can this mean, save that you see glory in death .P" 
 
 " You are too quick-sighted, sweet Kate," said Eichard, "and 
 see beyond the mark. I do not set my cast upon falling in this 
 fray ; though it may well happen that I should : but I have 
 another aim." 
 
 " Without guessing at what that may be," replied the lady, 
 "since you seem desirous to withhold the knowledge, permit 
 me to present another object to your choice ; decide between 
 them, and I submit : but do not carelessly turn from mine. 
 There is all to lose, nought to win, in what you now do. Death 
 may blot the future page, so that we read neither disgrace nor 
 prison in its sad lines ; but wherefore risk to die. While yet, 
 dear love, we are young, life has a thousand charms, and one 
 may be the miserable sui'vivor, whose heart now bleeds at the 
 mere surmise." 
 
 She faltered ; he kissed her soft cheek, and pressed her to his 
 heart. "Why may^we not — why should we not live?" con-

 tinued Katlierine ; " what is there in the name or state of king 
 that should so take captive our thoughts, that we can imagine 
 no life but on a throne? Believe me, careful nights and thorny- 
 days are the portion of a monarch : he is lifted to that awful 
 height only to view more clearly destruction beneath ; around, 
 fear, hate, disloyalt}'-, all yelling at him. The cold, heartless 
 Tudor may well desire the prize, for he has nothing save the 
 gilt crown to ennoble him ; nothing but the supple knees of 
 courtiers to present to him the show of love. But — ah ! could 
 I put fire into my weak words — my heart's zeal into my suppli- 
 catory voice — persuasion would attend upon me, and you would 
 feel that to the young, to two united as w^e are, our best kicgdom 
 is each other's hearts ; our dearest power that which each, 
 without let or envy, exercises over the other. Though our 
 palace-roof be the rafters of a lowly cot, our state, the dear 
 affection we bear each other, our attendants the duty and ob- 
 servance of one to the other — I, so served by King Edward's 
 son — you, by the rightful queen of this fair island — were better 
 waited on than Henry and Elizabeth, by their less noble ser- 
 vitors. I almost think that, with words like these, I might 
 draw you from the uneasy throne to the downy paradise of love ; 
 and can I not from this hard struggle, while death yet guards 
 the palace-gate, and you will be pierced through and through 
 long ere you can enter." 
 
 "Thus, my gentle love," said E^ichard, "you would have me 
 renounce my birth and name ; you desire that we become the 
 scorn of the world, and would be content that, so dishonoured, 
 the braggart impostor, and his dame Katherine, should spend 
 their shameful days in an ignominious sloth, misnamed tran- 
 quillity. I am a king, lady, though no holy oil nor jewelled 
 crown has touched this head ; and such I must prove myself." 
 
 "Oh, doubt it not," she replied, "it is proved by your own 
 speech and your own nobleness ; my heart approves you such ; J 
 the whole earth, till its latest day, will avouch that the lord 
 of Katherine is no deceiver ; but my words avail not with 
 
 " They do avail, my best, my angel girl, to show me that the 
 world's treasure is mere dross compared with thee : one only J 
 thing I prize, not as thy equal, but as that without which, I ~ 
 were a casket not even worthy to encase this jewel of the earth 
 — my honour ! A word taught me by my victim brother, by 
 my noble cousin Lincoln, by the generous PJantagenet; I learnt 
 its meaning among a race of heroes — the Christian cavaliers — 
 the Moorish chivalry of Spain ; dear is it to me, since without 
 it I would not partake your home of love — a home, more

 glorious and more blessed than the throne of the universe. It 
 is for that I novr fight, Katherine, not for a kingdom ; -which, 
 as thy royal cousin truly said, never will be mine. If I fall, 
 that cousin, the great, the munifi.cent James, will be your, 
 refuge." 
 
 " Never," interrupted the lady. " Scotland I shall never see 
 again; never show myself a queen and no queen, the mock of 
 their rude speech ; never put myself into my dear, but ambitious 
 father's hands, to be bartered away to another than my Richard ; 
 rather with your aunt of Burgundy, rather in Tudor's own 
 court, with your fair sister. Iloly angels ! of what do I speak ? 
 how frightfully distinct has the bereft world spread itself out as 
 m}'' widowed abode !" 
 
 A gush of tears closed her speech. " Think of brighter days, 
 my love," said Eichard, " they will be ours. You spoke erewhile 
 of the difficulty of giving true imagery to the living thought; 
 thus, I know not how to shape an appropriate garb (to use a 
 trope of my friend Skelton) for my inmost thoughts. I feel 
 sure of success. I feel, that in giving up every prospect of 
 acquiring my birthright, I make the due oblation to Fortune, 
 and that she will bestow the rest — that rest is to rescue my 
 name from the foul slur Henry has cast on it ; to establish my- 
 self as myself in the eyes of England ; and then to solicit your 
 patience in our calamity — your truth and love as the only sceptre 
 and globe this hand will ever grasp. In my own Spain, among 
 the orange and myrtle groves, the flowery plains and sun-lit: 
 hills of Andalusia, we will live unambitious, yet more fortunate 
 than crowned emperors." 
 
 With such words and promises he soothed her fears ; to the 
 word honour she had no reply. Yet it was a mere word here ; 
 in this case, a barren word, on which her life and happiness 
 were to be wrecked. 
 
 The prince and Monina had met with undisguised delight. 
 "No Cliftbrd would now dare traduce her ; she need not banish 
 herself from countries where his name enriched the speech of all 
 men ; nor even from that which, invited by her, he had come to 
 conquer. He was glad to be able to extend his zealous fraternal 
 protection over her, to feel that he might guard her through 
 life, despite of the fortune that divided them. He obtained for 
 her the Lady Katheriue's regard, which she sought opportu- 
 nities to demonstrate, while they were avoided by Monina, who 
 honoured and loved her as Eichard's wife and dearest friend, 
 5^et made occasion to absent herself from both. Nothing beauti- 
 ful could be so unlike as these two fair ones. Katherine was 
 the incarnate image of loveliness, such as it might have been

 conceived by an anp^elic nature ; noble, soft, equable from her 
 tender care not to displease others ; in spite of the ills of fate, 
 gay, because self-satisfied and resigned ; the brijjht side of 
 'things was that which she contemplated : the bright and the 
 tranquil' — although the hazards run by him she loved, at this 
 period informed her thoughts with terror. Monina — no, there 
 was no evil in Monina ; if too much self-devotion, too passion- 
 ate an attachment to one dear idea, too enthusiastic an adoration 
 of one exalted being, could be called aught but virtue. The full 
 orbs of her dark eyes, once flashing bright, were now more 
 serious, more melancholy ; her very smile would make you 
 weep ; her vivacity, all concentred in one object, forgot to 
 spend itself on trifles ; yet, while the princess wept that Eichard 
 should encounter fruitless danger for a mistaken aim, gladness 
 sat on Monina's brow : " He goes to conquer ; God will give 
 victory to the right : as a warrior he treads his native land ; as 
 a monarch he will rule over her. The very name of king he 
 bears will shame the lukewarm English; they will gather round 
 the apparent sun, now that he shows himself unclouded, leaving 
 the false light, Tudor, to flicker into its native nothingness." 
 
 "Monina," said the prince, "you in the wide world can 
 bestow richest largess on the beggar. King Eichard." She 
 looked on him in wonder. " I go to conquer or to die : this, 
 lovely one, is no new language for you ; a warrior's friend 
 must hear such words unflinching. I die without a fear if jou 
 take one charge upon you." Her beaming, expressive eyes 
 replied to him. He continued : " The Adalid and safety are 
 images most firmly united in my mind ; if I cannot find security 
 on board of her myself, let those dear to me inherit my posses- 
 sion there. The hardest thought that I bear with me, is that 
 my fair queen should become captive to my base-minded foe. 
 May I not trust that if I fall, the Adalid will be her home and 
 refuge to convey her to her native country, or any whither she 
 may direct? I intrust this charge to you, my sister, my far 
 more than sister, my own kind Monina. You will forget 
 yourself in that fateful hour, to fulfil my latest wish? " 
 
 " My prince," she replied, " your words were cruel, did I not 
 know that you speak in over-care, and not from the impulse of 
 your heart. In the same spirit, I promise that your desire shall 
 be accomplished : if you fall, my father will protect — die for my 
 lady the queen. But why speak these ill-omened words? You 
 will succeed ; you will hasten tlie lagging hand of Fate, and 
 dethrone one never born to reign, to bestow on England its 
 rightful king. The stars promise this in their resplendent, un- 
 failing scrowl — the time-worn student in his lore has proclaimed

 it — the sacred name of monareli which you bear is the pledge 
 and assurance of predestined victory." 
 
 " And you, meanwhile, will stay, and assure Katherine's 
 destiny ? " 
 
 " My dear lord, I have a task to accomplish. If I leave her 
 grace, it is because all spirits of good and power watch over 
 her, and my weak support is needed elsewhere. I am bound 
 for London." 
 
 They parted thus. The temerity of their designs sometimes 
 inspired them with awe ; but more usually animated them to 
 loftier hopes. When the thickening shadows of •' coming 
 events " clouded their spirits, they took refuge in the sun- 
 bright imaginations which painted to each the accomplishment 
 of their several hopes. Monina felt assured that the hour of 
 victory was at hand. Kichard looked forward to a mortal 
 struggle, to be crowned with success : a few short weeks or 
 briefer days would close the long account : his word redeemed, 
 his honour avenged, he looked forward to his dear reward : not 
 a sceptre — that was a plaything fit for Henry's hand ; but to a 
 life of peace and love ; a very eternity of sober, waking bliss, 
 to be passed with her he idolized, in the sunny clime of his 
 regretted Spain.

 The lapse of years had confirmed Henry on his throne. He 
 was extortionate and severe, it is true ; and thus revolts had 
 been frequent during the earlier portion of his reign ; but they 
 took their rise in a class which, even in modern days, it is 
 difficult to keep within the boundaries of law. The peasantry, 
 scattered and dependent on the nobles, were tranquil :^ but arti-

 ficers, such as the miners of Cornwall, who met in numbers, and 
 could ask each other, " Why, while there is plenty in the land, 
 should we and our children starve? Why pay our liard 
 earnings into the regal coffers?" and, still increasing in bold- 
 ness, demand at last, " Why should these men govern us ? 
 
 " We are many — they are few ! " 
 
 Thus sedition sprung from despair, and assumed arms ; to which 
 Henry had many engines to oppose, bulwarks of his power. A 
 commercial spirit had sprung up during his reign, partly arising 
 from the progress of civilization, and partly from so large a 
 portion of the ancient nobility having perished in the civil wars. 
 'J'he spirit of chivalry, which isolates men, had given place to 
 that of trade, which unites them in bodies. 
 
 Among these tlie White Eose of England had not a single 
 partizan — the nobles who once had upheld the house of York 
 were few ; they had for the last eight years been intent upon 
 restoring their fortunes, and were wholly disinclined to the en- 
 dangering them afresh for a stranger youth. When Fitzwater, 
 Stanley, and their numerous fellow-conspirators and fellov>-- 
 victims, sided with the duke of York, nearly all England enter- 
 tained a timid belief in his identity with lung Edward's lost son 
 — but those times were changed. Many were glad to soothe 
 their consciences by declaring him an impostor ; many so desired 
 to curry favour with Henry ; a still greater number either feared 
 to j5ay their thought, or were averse to disturb the tranquillity 
 of their country by a contest which could benefit one man alone, 
 and which must entail on them another war like that so lately 
 ended. Abroad, in France, Burgundy, and Scotland, the prince 
 might be discountenanced from political motives ; but he was 
 treated with respect, and spoken of as being the man he named 
 himself: in England it was otherwise — contempt followed hard 
 upon fear, giving birth to derision, the best weapon against the 
 unhappy, which Henry well knew how to wield. He had two 
 motives in this — one was, that by affixing disgrace and scorn to 
 his adversary, he took away the glitter of his cause, and deterred 
 the young and ambitious from any desire to share in his obloquy. 
 The other was a feeling deeper-rooted in his mind — an intense 
 hatred of the house of York — an exultation in its overthrow 
 and disgrace — a gloating over every circumstance that blotted it 
 with ignominy. If Eichard had really been an impostor, Henry 
 had not used half the pains to stigmatize him as low-born — to 
 blast his pride with nicknames, nor have looked forward with 
 the joy he nowdid, to having him in his power — to the degra-

 datiun — tlic mortal staia of iufamy lie intended to taint him 
 with for ever. 
 
 Secure in power — fearless of the result, Henry heard with 
 unfeif^ned joy that his young rival had landed in England, and 
 was advancing into the interior of the island, at the head of the 
 Cornish insurgents. He himself announced the rising io his 
 nobles. Laughing, he said, " I have tidings for you, gentlemen, 
 a flight of wild geese clad in eagles' feathers, are ready to pounce 
 upon us. Even now they hover over our good city of Exeter, 
 frigliting the honest burghers with their dissonance." 
 
 " Biackheath will witness another victory," said Lord Oxford. 
 
 " And my kitchen receive a new scullion," replied the king ; 
 •' since Lambert Simncl became falconer, our roast meat thinks 
 itself dishonoured at not being spitted by a pretender to my 
 crown ; for no Audley heads these fellows, but the king of 
 Eakehells himself, the most noble Perkin, who, to grace the 
 more the unwashed rogues, calls himself Eichard the Fourth 
 for the nonce. I have fair hope to see his majesty this bout, if 
 he whiz not away in a fog, or sink underground like Lord Lovel, 
 to the disappointment of all merry fellows wLo love new masks 
 and gaudy mumming." 
 
 " JPlease your majesty," said the young Lord William Court- 
 ney, " it is for the honour of our house that not a stone of 
 Exeter be harmed. With your good leave, my father and 
 myself will gather in haste what force we may : if fortune aid 
 us, we may present your grace with your new servitor." 
 
 " Be it so, my lord," replied the king, " and use good dispatch. 
 AYe ourselves will not tarry : so that, with less harm to all, we 
 may tread out these hasty lighted embers. Above all, let not 
 Duke Perkin escape ; it is my dearest wish that he partake 
 our hospitality." 
 
 " Yes," so ran Henry's private thoughts ; "he must be mine,- 
 mine alive, mine to deal with as I list." With even more care 
 than he put in the mustering his army, he ordered that the whole 
 of the southern sea-coast of England should be guarded ; every 
 paltry fishing village had its garrison, which permitted no boat 
 to put off to sea, nor any to land, without the strictest investi- 
 gation ; not content with this, he committed it to the care of his 
 baser favourites to forge some plot which might betray his enemy 
 without a blow into his hands. 
 
 *' Give me your benison, good Bess," said the monarch, with 
 . unwonted gaiety of manner ; "with daylight I depart on the 
 ungentle errand of encountering your brother Perkin." 
 
 Elizabeth, not less timid than she had ever been, was alarmed 
 by his show of mirth, and by this appellation bestowed on one

 she knew to be so near of kin. That very morning she had seen 
 Monina — the enthusiastic Monina, who, confiding in her royal 
 friend's success, visited London to watch over the fate of Ehza- 
 beth and her children. The queen smiled at her offers of ser- 
 vice ; she felt that no such army could endanger Henry's reign ; 
 but she feared for Richard, for her ill-fated brother, who had 
 now entered the net, for whom she felt assured there was no 
 escape. Trembling at her own boldness, she answered the 
 king, " Whoever he may be, you will not destroy him in cold 
 blood ? " 
 
 "You would have me spare the impostor?" asked Henry. 
 *' Spare him who claims your son's throne ? By Our Lady of 
 Walsingham, the maternal virtues of the daughter of York 
 deserve high praise." 
 
 Elizabeth, dreading more to offend, horror-struck at the idea 
 that her husband should shed her brother's blood, burst into 
 tears. " Silly girl," said Henry, " I am not angry ; nay, more, 
 I grant your prayer. Perkin, if not slain by a chance blow, 
 shall live. My word is passed, trust to it ; I neither inquire nor 
 care whether he be the godson or the base brat of the libertine 
 Edward. In either case, my revenge stoops not so low as his 
 paltry life : does this content you ? " 
 
 " May the saints bless your grace," said Elizabeth, " you 
 have eased my every fear." 
 
 " Remember then that you prove no ingrate," continued the 
 king, " no dupe of report, no traducer of your children's birth. 
 Betray no interest in the knave's downfall, save as he is my 
 enemy. If you display any emotion that awakens a doubt that 
 this canker rose be aught in your eyes except a base pretender — 
 if you mark any feeling but stern contempt for one so vile — 
 tremble. My vengeance will fall on him ; and his blood be on 
 ■your head." 
 
 *' Magnanimous prince ! " thought Elizabeth, in bitter scorn, 
 when he had left her : " this is your mercy. You fear ! My 
 poor Eichard — your sister, a monarch's daughter, is finely 
 taught by this earl's son. But you will live ; then let him do 
 his worst : the queen of England is not quite a slave ; if Henry 
 can bind, Elizabeth may loose ; and the duke of York laugh in 
 another land at the malice of his enemy." 
 
 We return to this prince, whose lofty spirit was sustained by 
 an aim, an object dearer than a kingdom in his eyes. He 
 arrived before Exeter at the head of seven thousand men. AU 
 the discontented in Cornwall and Devonshire joined him. Some 
 of these were younger brothers ; some men-at-arms who repined 
 at peace j chiefly they were needy, oppressed men, roused by a

 sense of wrong, as destitute, but not so hardy as the kerns of 
 Ireland. Still they were many, they were valiant ; Exeter was 
 ungarrisoned, unprepared for defence, and there was a pos- 
 sibility that by sudden assault, he might possess himself of the 
 town. With this intent he did not allow his troops time to 
 repose, but at once set on for the attack, endeavouring to scale 
 the lofty walls ; unaided by any fitting machinery, scarcely pos- 
 sessed of a single scaling ladder, he was driven back with loss. 
 Foiled, but not vanquished, for his heart was set upon this 
 prize, for three days, though unpossessed of artillery or any 
 warlike engine, he exerted his utmost force to win the city ; he 
 contrived rude machinery to cast stones, he planted the ladders 
 himself, he multiplied himself to appear everywhere, flattering, 
 encouraging, leading his troops again and again to the assault. 
 When they found the walls impregnable, he made an attempt 
 on the gates ; with fascines and hewed trees he set one of them 
 on fire ; his men shouted as they heard the stout oak crackle, 
 and saw it split and crumble, offering a large opening ; but the 
 citizens, made desperate, fearful of the ravages this untamed 
 multitude might commit, were true to themselves ; they resisted 
 fire by fire, keeping up a fierce blaze within, till with piles of 
 brick and rubbish they had blocked the passage. Eichard saw 
 his last hope fail. " This is not the work of the burghers," he 
 cried, " a soldier's skill is here." 
 
 " True as my old yard measure !" cried Heron. " It was but 
 last night that my cousin, the earl of Devon, clambered into the 
 city ; he came to the northern wall, where Skelton keeps watch ; 
 when my valiant tailor heard the noise, he ran to look for Master 
 Trereife, who, poor fellow, lies cold within the moat. The 
 citizens heard and answered my cousin the earl's call ; but they 
 were too frightened to let light through the keyhole of a 
 postern ; and his lordship, God save him ! was obliged to climb 
 the battlements." 
 
 " Climb the battlements, noble captain?" said Eichard ; "that 
 is, a ladder was let down !" 
 
 " It was a stone ladder he scaled, my liege," said Heron ; 
 " your grace may walk up the same. It will scarce budge, seeing 
 that it is the old part of the wall itself." 
 
 *' Who knows more of this ?" asked the prince. 
 
 " I saw the whole," said Skelton ; " That is the end. Master 
 Trereife was dead for the nonce, so I came back to lead my men 
 to the fray. There was the earl, perched like a crow, on the 
 boughs of an old thorn-bush that grows at the top of the wall. 
 Surely he must have torn his cloak, for the place is thick with 
 all manner of weeds, and rough stones, and brambles. But

 more tlian his broadcloth gfot a hole ; for Clim of Tregothius 
 handled his bow, and let fly a cloth-yard shaft, which was 
 stickino^ in his shoulder as he got down the other side." 
 
 While the tailor talked, Hichard was proceeding hastily to the 
 ppot. It looked tranquil. The old crumbling wall was green 
 with rank grass and tangled weeds. He drew nearer, and then 
 a whole shower of arrows was discharged against him. The earl 
 had expected that his success would excite their curiosity, and 
 prepared for them, with not the less zeal on account of his own 
 wound. Eichard escaped unhurt ; but Edmund, who was 
 scantily armed, received an arrow iu his side — he fell. That 
 same hour tidings came of the advance of King Henry at the 
 ]iead of a formidable army. 
 
 Plantaganet's wound was dressed ; it showed signs of danger, 
 and quite disabled him. " My faithful fellows swear to pre- 
 serve you in safety, cousin," said Richard ; *' I must leave 
 you." 
 
 " Do you retreat ?" asked Edmund. 
 
 " 'No, by my soul ! Truly, my hopes have somewhat quailed ; 
 yet it is but a lucky blow, and I gain all. I leave you, my 
 friend ; but I will not leave you in doubt and ignorance. Bead 
 this paper : it is to enforce its contents — to oblige my haughty 
 foe to lay aside his worst weapon, detraction, that I, against all 
 probability and wisdom, will urge my cause to the last. My 
 kingdom, it is his ; my honour he must restore, and I cry him 
 quits. JNTow you have my secret. Pardon for my poor fellows ; 
 pardon, and some alleviation of their cruel lot. For myself, as 
 you will find, I ask little, but I must show no fear, no retreating, 
 to obtain even that. I march forwards, then, towards Taunton : 
 it is a less place than Exeter. The smallest secure port gained, 
 and Henry may grant my boon." 
 
 Plantaganet unfolded the paper, and read these words : — 
 
 *' Richard, legitimate and true son of Edward the Fourth, 
 king of England and France, and lord of Ireland, to Henry, the 
 reigning sovereign of these realms. In my infancy I was made 
 a prisoner by a usurping uncle, escaping from his thrall by 
 aid of the most noble earl of Lincoln. This uncle, this usurper, 
 you conquered, and seized upon his crown. You claim the 
 same by right of Bolingbroke, and strengthen your title through 
 your union with my sister, the Lady Elizabeth. I am poor, and 
 an outcast — you a king. God has destroyed my house, and I 
 submit. But I will not submit to the vile slander that takes 
 from me my name, and brands me a dishonoured man.

 claim to the crown. Lancaster lias many partisans, and the 
 victory is yours. But as duke of York, I challenge and defy 
 you. I call on you, either by person or by champion, to meet 
 me in the lists, that I may defend my honour and maintain the 
 right. Let us spare the people's blood. In single combat let 
 my pretensions be set at issue ; and my good sword shall cut to 
 pieces the wicked lies and base traditions you have calumniously 
 and falsely forged to my disgrace. 
 
 " Body to body, I will meet you or your champion. ]S^ame 
 tlie day, the hour, and the place. With my lance and my sword, 
 to the death I will maintain my birth. If I fall, T ask that my 
 Mife, the Lady Katherine Grordon, be permitted to return to her 
 royal cousin, James of Scotland ; that such of my followers as 
 desire it, may be allowed to go beyond seas ; th^t those of your 
 subjects, who, goaded into rebellion by your exactions, have 
 taken up arms, receive free pardon and remission of their 
 imposts. If I conquer, I add but one other demand — that you 
 confess to the wide world how foully you have slandered me ; 
 revoke the lies you have published, and acknowledge me to all 
 men, the rightful duke of York. 
 
 *' If you -deny my just demands, be the blood spilt in defence 
 of my honour on your head ; England ravaged, your towns 
 destroyed, your realm subject to all the calamities of war ; these 
 evils rest with you. I will not sheathe my sword, nor tread one 
 backward step in my undertaking ; but as in the lists, so on the 
 dread battle-field, meet your abettors, and conquer or die in 
 defence of my name. Expecting a fitting answer to this just 
 defiance, I bid you heartily farewell. 
 
 " Etchasd. 
 
 " "Written under the walls of Exeter, this twelfth day of 
 September, in the year of our Blessed Lord, 1497." 
 
 Plantagenet was deeply affected by his cousin's gallantry. 
 He sighed, saying, " Tudor has not, will not reply to your 
 challenge ? " 
 
 " He has not, but he may," replied Eichard. '*' I have, I 
 know not whv, a firm belief that good will come from it. If 
 not, m a few days all will be over. In a very few days you can 
 be conveyed to St. Michael's Mount, where the queen now is. 
 The Adalid hovers near. Save her, save yourself: save one 
 other, less helpful than my Katherine — be a brother to Monina." 
 
 Eichard, erring in his mark, was animated by the most san- 
 guine hopes, to which he was seduced by a constant belief that 
 his life was not near its close, and therefore that his claims

 would be admitted : as otlierwise lie liad resolved to fall in the 
 assertion of tliem. Leaving the sick-couch of his cousin, he pre- 
 pared to advance to Taunton. A conversation meanwhile which 
 he dreamt not of, and would have scorned, had taken place in an 
 obscure and gloomy spot in London, fraught with fate to him. 
 
 After the base desertion of his royal master, Frion had sailed 
 to England with the other hirelings of Henry ; among these was 
 Clifford— Clifford, whose need and whose malice armed him 
 against York's life, but who tried to hide his shame under an 
 assumed appellation. There had always been a false fellowship 
 and a real enmity between Frion and the knight. On his first 
 arrival in Brussels, the secretary looked on him as an interloper ; 
 and Clifford, while he used the other, tried to force him into his 
 place as an underling, and to blind him to his own designs. 
 When he betrayed his party, spreading death among the partizans 
 of York, and annihilating the cause, Frion, whose fortunes 
 depended on its success, was unmeasured in his expressions of 
 indignation and contempt. They had worked in direct oppo- 
 sition the year before in Kent : and, when Frion saw the hand 
 of this reprobated man uplifted in midnight assassination, he 
 triumphed in the lowness of his fall. Both were traitors now, 
 both baffled : Frion looked on Clifford as the worse villain ; and 
 Clifford writhed under the familiar impertinence of a menial. 
 They arrived in London ; Sir E-obert was dismissed with barren 
 thanks, Frion thrown into prison ; how far the knight's account 
 gave intimation of the Frenchman's double-dealing, and so 
 brought this severity upon him was not known, but for three 
 ' months this mercurial spirit had languished in confinement. 
 
 Addicted to scheming, he had now full leisure to spend his 
 whole thoughts that way ; a single, simple plot was too plain for 
 his industrious soul ; he wore a whole web of them so intricate, 
 that he sometimes lost the clue himself; not the less did he do 
 his endeavour to put them in action. He intended either to 
 lose Richard or make him ; either to be the cause of his over- 
 throwing Henry, or of being overthrown by him ; in either case, 
 to reap favour and advantage from the triumphant party. 
 
 Sad as is ever a prison-house, it was worse in those days of 
 incivilization : this pen could ill describe the squalid figures and 
 dire visages that crowded its tumultuous court. Even here 
 Frion reigned umpire ; but he broke from a knot of noisy squab- 
 blers, who held tattered cards, and appealed to him on a 
 question of fair-play, as he saw one enter. Even he a wretch, 
 yet many degrees better than the best of his miserable com- 
 panions ; a scarlet suit, trimmed with gold lace, somewhat 
 tarnished, a cloak of ample folds, but threadbare, a dark plumed

 bonnet, drawn over his brow, above all, a rapier at his side, dis- 
 tinguished him from the prisoners. " This is kind, Sir Eobert," 
 said . Frion in his softest manner, " I half feared you were too 
 proud or politic to visit a disgraced man ; for these last three 
 days I have despaired of your worship ; by my fay ! you are 
 riffht welcome." 
 
 Clifford cast a shuddering look around the walls ; his eyes 
 were hollow ; his cheek sunk ; he was the mere shadow of bold 
 Eobert. "Few words are best thanks, Master Stephen," he 
 replied ; " I am kind to you because the dice are cruel to me ; 
 you promise largely, and my wants are no dwarfs. AVhat are 
 your designs ? " 
 
 " This is no place for parley," said Frion ; "follow me." He 
 led the way through several narrow passages to a miserable cell ; 
 straw was heaped in one corner for a bed ; the walls were dank 
 and tattered; the floor^broken and filthy. " Welcome to my 
 domicile, sir knight," said Frion : whether it were compunction 
 that he had brought him to this, or distrust tbat the injury 
 would be revenged, Clifford shrunk back and bis lips grew livid. 
 "One would not live here from choice," said Frion, "I allow j 
 yet do not grudge me a few moments, it may stead us both." 
 
 " To the point then," said the knight ; " it is not the place, 
 Master Frion ; but at the hour of noon — " 
 
 " No excuses, you like the place as ill as I," said the French- 
 man, with a bland smile; "but you are more generous, fori 
 would not dwell an instant's space here of my own will to gain 
 any man's salvation. ISTow, what news from the west ? Is it 
 true that the duke of York is slain ? or Exeter taken ? both 
 reports are rife. Adam Wicherly and Mat Oldcraft made their 
 escape two days ago, to join the gallant. Mat was seized again, 
 and savs that there were bonfires in Southwark for Eichard the 
 Fourth." 
 
 Clifford, by a brief detail, answered, and then after some hesi- 
 tation said, " He is not so low but that the king desires him to 
 be lower : he who could bring him, bound hand and foot, to 
 London, would be made a man. Empson saw G-arthe yesterday ; 
 and he, who calls me Wiatt, came post to consult with me ; but 
 it were hazardous to attempt him ; he is ten thousand strong." 
 
 _" You know me, Sir Eobert," said Frion ; " there are few 
 things I cannot bring about, so that I have room to ruflie in. I 
 have a plot, King Eichard is ours in three days, so one word be 
 said ; that word is liberty to me. Take you the reward ; I ask 
 no further share in your gains than free leave to set the channel 
 between me and this dingy island."

 spired for the prince's fall: like "mousing owls " tliey hawked 
 at an eagle with too true an aim. York's thoughts were of 
 honour ; but through them they were to be drugged with 
 ignominy and despair. It is melancholy that circumstance and 
 fortune should have power to reach the very shrine of our 
 dearest thoughts ; degrading them from their original brightness 
 to a likeness of the foul aspect of the outer world. Eichard's 
 free and noble spirit was to become plastic to the touch of such 
 men as the fallen Clifford and crafty Prion. Men, whom he had 
 cast from him as unworthy his regard, could besiege the citadel 
 of his hopes, and garrison it with disgrace ; forcing him to occupy 
 himself with ideas as base as those which possessed their own 
 minds. It is the high heart's curse to be obliged to expend its 
 deep and sacred emotions in hatred of, or struggle with things so 
 mean, so very alien to its own aspiring nature.

 KiCHAED proceeded towards Taunton. Although this was in 
 appearance an advance, his ill-success before Exeter, and report 
 of the large force already brought against them by Sir John 
 Cheney, King Henry's cliamberlain, had so far discouraged his 
 followers as to occasion the desertion of many, so that of the seven 
 thousand he had with him in Devonshire, he retained but three on 
 his arrival near Taunton. These consisted of the original body of 
 insurgents, Cornishmen, wlio had proceeded too far to go back, 
 and who, partly in affection for their leader, partly from natural 
 stubbornness, swore to die in the cause. Poor fellows ! rusty 
 rapiers, and misshapen lances were their chief arms ; a few had 
 bows ; others slings ; a still greater number their ponderous tools, 
 implements of labour and of peace, to be used now in slaughter. 
 Their very dress displayed at once their unmartial and poverty- 
 stricken state. In all these might be gathered a troop of three

 hundred foot, not wholly destitute of arms and discipline. The 
 horse were not less at fault; yet among them there were about one 
 hundred tolerably mounted, the riders, indeed, but too frequently 
 disgracing their steeds. 
 
 It required all Eichard's energy of purpose to hold him back 
 from despair. The bitter sense of degradation visited him in 
 s])ite of every effort. Had he ever made one of the chivalry of 
 France and Burgundy ? Had he run a tilt with James of Scot- 
 land, or grasped in knightly brotherhood the mailed hand of Sir 
 Patrick Hamilton ? And were these his comrades ? unwashed 
 artificers ; ragged and rude peasants ; vulgar-tongued traders ? 
 He felt " in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes ; " and now to 
 obtain pardon for them, to send them back scathless to their 
 own homes, was his chief desire, even to the buying of their 
 safety with his own downfall. 
 
 After a two days' march he arrived near Taunton. On recon- 
 noitring the town, its position and weakness gave him hope that 
 he might carry it, even with his sorry soldiery. To check these 
 thoughts, tidings came, that Sir John Cheney was in close neigh- 
 bourhood, and Henry himself advancing with a chosen body of 
 men. On the evening of their arrival before the town, a detach- 
 ment of the enemy entered it, cutting off the last hope of 
 Eichard. 
 
 The next morning it became evident that the crisis of his for- 
 tunes was at hand. The whole country teemed with soldiery. 
 As the troops poured towards a common centre, the array and 
 order of a battle-field became apparent in their operations. A 
 battle, between a very myriad of golden-spurred knights, armed 
 at all points, and the naked inhabitants of Eichard's camp ! call 
 it rather a harvest ; there were the reapers, here the bending 
 corn. TVhen in the north Eichard wept over the devastation of 
 the land, he felt that a word of his could counteract the harm — 
 but now, his challenge had proved an airy dagger — substance- 
 less — his resolve to encounter his foe, bringing the unarmed 
 against these iron-suited warriors, grew in his eyes into pre- 
 meditated murder : his heart heaved in his overcharged breast. 
 To add bitterness to his thoughts there were his companions — 
 O 'Water brave in despair ; Astley pale with fear for his lord ; 
 Heron foolish in his unmeaning boasting ; Skelton trembling in 
 every joint, and talking incessantly, apparently to deafen him- 
 self to " the small still voice" that whispered terror to his 
 heart. 
 
 Eichard spent the day among his men. They were prepared 
 to fight ; if needs must, to fall : protestations of sturdy devotion, 
 the overflowing of the rude, manly heart, always affecting, met

 him at every turn. He was beloved, for he was generous and 
 Ifind. Often he had exposed his hfe, when before Exeter, to 
 save some one amon^ them : when dismayed, he had cheered, 
 when defeated, he had comforted them ; nor did he leave the 
 body of the meanest camp-follower uninterred ; for one of 
 Hichard's characteristics was a quick sympathy with his species, 
 and a reverence for all that bore the shape of man. But, while 
 these qualities rendered him dear to all, they inspired him with 
 a severe sense of his duties towards others, and a quick insight 
 into their feelings ; thus increasing to anguish the disquietude 
 that agitated him. 
 
 Towards evening he was alone in his tent. At first he was 
 confused by the various aspects, all terrible, that his fortunes 
 assumed. By the caprice of destiny, he, who was descended 
 from a line of kings, who had so long been the inhabitant of 
 courts, a cavalier, honourable in his degree, renowned for his 
 prowess, had not one noble-born partizan near him : not one of 
 his ancient counsellors, to whom he had been used to defer, 
 remained ; he was absolutely alone ; the sense of right and jus- 
 tice in his own heart was all he possessed, to be a beacon-light 
 in this awful hour, when thousands depended upon his word- 
 yet had he the power to save ? 
 
 An idea, dim at first as a star on the horizon's verge, 
 struggling through vapours, but growing each second brighter 
 and clearer, dawned upon his mind. All then was over ! his 
 prophetic soul had proved false in its presumed foreknowledge ; 
 defeat, dishonour, disgrace tracked his steps. To lead his troops 
 forth, and then to redeem them at Henry's hand, by the con- 
 ditionless surrender of himself, was the thought, child of despair 
 and self-devotion, that, still struggling with the affections and 
 weaknesses of his nature, presented itself, not yet full fledged, 
 but about to become so. 
 
 He had been several times interrupted during his meditations 
 by the arrival of scouts, with various reports of the situation and 
 proceedings of the enemy : Richard, better than these untaught 
 recruits, knew the meaning of the various operations. As if on 
 a map, he saw the stationing of a large and powerful army in 
 expectation of battle ; and was aware how incapable he was to 
 cope with their numbers and force. At last Astley announced 
 the arrival of two men : one was a Fleming, known to Eichard 
 as one of Lalayne's men, but the fellow was stupidly drunk ; the 
 other was an English peasant. " Please your worship," he said, 
 " I am this man's guide, and must act as his interpreter besides ; 
 nothing would serve the spungy fellow but he must swallow ale 
 at every^tavern on the way."^

 "Speak, then," said Eichard ; "what is the purport of his 
 journey ? " 
 
 " Please you, sir, last night three hundred of them came right 
 pop upon us afore we were aware : sore afraid they made us 
 with their tall iron-shafted poles, steel caps, and short swords, 
 calling each one for bread and beer." 
 
 " Do you mean," cried the prince, his e3'e brightening as he 
 spoke, " that three hundred men, soldiers, armed like yonder 
 fellow, are landed in England? " 
 
 So the countryman averred ; and that even now they were but 
 at the distance of twenty miles from Eichard's encampment. 
 They were still advancing, when the report was spread that the 
 prince's forces were dispersed, himself taken priaoner. The 
 rustic drew from the Fleming's pocket a letter, in French, signed 
 by Schwartz, a son of him who fell at Stoke, a man in high favour 
 with the Lady Margaret of Burgundy. It said how he had been 
 despatched by her grace to his succour ; how intelligence of the 
 large army of Henry, and his defeat, had so terrified his men, 
 that they refused to proceed, nay, by the next morning would 
 take their way back to Poole, where they had landed, unless 
 Eichard himself came to reassure them, and to lead them on. 
 Every word of the letter lighted up to forgotten joy young 
 Eichard's elastic spirit. With these men to aid him, giving 
 weight and respectability to his powers, he might hope to enforce 
 the conditions of his challenge. All must be decided on the 
 morrow ; that very hour he Avould set forth, to return before 
 morning with these welcome succours. 
 
 It was near midnight ; his camp was still : the men, in expect- 
 ation of the morrow's struggle, had retired to repose ; their 
 leaders had orders to visit their commander in his tent at the 
 hour which now the empty hour-glass told was come. Hastilj', 
 eagerly, Eichard aimounced the arrival of these German merce- 
 naries ; he directed them to accompany him, that with some 
 show of attendance he might present himself to Schwartz. The 
 camp was not to be disturbed ; two or three men alone among 
 them were awakened, and ordered to keep guard — in five hours 
 assuredly he must return. In a brief space of time, the troop 
 who were to accompany him, Heron, Skelton, O'Water, and 
 Astley, with some forty more, led their horses to his tent in 
 silence : — there were few lights through all the camp ; their 
 honest hearts which beat within slept, while he was awake to 
 succour and save them. This was Eichard's last thought, as, 
 mounted on his good steed, he led the way across the d:m heath 
 towards Yeovil. 
 
 It was such a night as is frequent at the end of September ; a

 warm but furious west-wind tore alono^ tlie sky, shaking the 
 dark tresses of tlie tress, and chasing the broad shadows of the 
 clouds across the plains. The moon, at the beginning of her 
 third quarter, sped through the sky with rapid silvery wings ; 
 now cutting the dark, sea-like ether ; now plunging deep amidst 
 the clouds ; now buried in utter darkness ; anon spreading a 
 broad halo among the thinner woof of vapours. The guide was 
 at the prince's side ; Heron, upon his short, sturdy pony, was 
 just behind ; Skelton tried to get his tall mare to an even pace 
 with Richard's horse, but she fell back continually : the rushing, 
 howling wind and rustling trees drowned the clatter of the hoofs,. 
 They reached the extreme edge of the common ; Eichard turned 
 his head — the lights of his little camp burnt dim in the moon- 
 shine, its poor apparel of tents was lost in the distance : they 
 entered a dark lane, and lost sight of every trace of it ; still they 
 rode fleetly on. I^ight, and the obscure shapes of night around 
 — holy, blinding, all-seeing night ! when we feel the power of 
 the Omnipotent as if immediately in contact with us ; when 
 religion fills the soul, and our very fears are unearthly ; when 
 familiar images assume an unknown power to thrill our hearts ; 
 and the winds and trees and shapeless clouds have a voice not 
 their own, to speak of all that we dream or imagine beyond our 
 actual life. Through embowered lanes, whose darkness seemed 
 thick and palpable — over open, moonshiny fields, where the airy 
 chase of clouds careered in dimmer shapes upon the earth — 
 Richard rode forward, fostering newly-awakened hope ; glad in 
 the belief that while he saved all who depended on him, he 
 would not prove a mere victim led in tame submission, an 
 unrighteous sacrifice to the Evil Spirit of tlie World.

 Of these poor folk ; whose souls \vith black dishonom'

 SoiiE miles to the east of Yeovil there was a deep stream, whose 
 precipitous banks were covered by a thick underwood that 
 almost concealed the turbid waters, which undermined and 
 bared the twisted and gnarled roots of the various overhanging 
 trees or shrubs. The left side of the stream was bounded by an 
 abrupt hill, at the foot of which was a narrow pathway ; on the 
 green acclivity flourished a beech grove, whose roots were 
 spread in many directions to catch the soil, while their trunks, 
 some almost horizontal, were all fantastically grown, and the 
 fairy tracery of the foliage shed such soft, mellowed, chequered 
 light as must incline the heart of the wanderer beneath the 
 leafy bower to delicious musings. 
 
 ]S"ow the moon silvered the trees, and sometimes glimmered 
 on the waters, whose murmurs contended with the wind that 
 sung among the boughs : and was this all ? A straggling moon- 
 beam fell on something bright amid the bushes, and a deep 
 voice cried, " Jack of tlie Wynd, if thou can'st not get to thicker 
 cover, pluck darnels to cover that cursed steel cap of thine." 
 
 "Hush!" repeated another lower voice, "your bawling is 
 worse than his head-piece ; you outroar the wind. How high the 
 moon is, and our friends not come ; — he will be here before them."

 Sickness, and faintness, and throbbing pain were the first 
 tokens of life that visited his still failing sense ; sight and the 
 power of motion seemed to have deserted him, but memory 
 reviving told him that he was a prisoner. Moments were 
 stretched to ages while he strove to collect his sensations ; still 
 it was night ; the view of fields and uplands and of the varied 
 moon-lit sky grew upon his languid senses ; he was still on 
 horseback, bound to the animal, and supported on either side by 
 men. As his movements communicated his returning strength, 
 one of these fellows rode to impart the tidings to their leader, 
 while the other stayed to guide his horse ; the word "gallop! " 
 was called aloud, and he was urged alono^ at full speed, while 
 the sudden motion almost threw him back into his swoon. 
 
 Dawn, which at first seemed to add to the dimness and indis- 
 tinctness of the landscape, struggling through the clouds, and 
 paling the moon, slowly stole upon them. The prince became 
 suflBciently alive to make observations ; he and his fellow- 
 prisoners were five in number only, their guards were ten ; 
 foremost among them was one whom, in whatever guise, he 
 could not mistake. Each feeling: in Richard's heart stimulated 
 him to abhor that man, yet he pitied him more. Gallant, bold 
 Robin, the frolicksome page, the merry- witted sharer of a 
 thousand pleasures. Time, thou art a thief; how base a thief — 
 when thou stealest not only our friends, our youth, our hopes, 
 but, besides, our innocence ; giving us in the place of light- 
 hearted confidence — guile, distrust, the consciousness of evil 
 deeds. In these thoughts, Richard drew the colouring of the 
 picture, from the fresh and vivid tints that painted his own 
 soul. Clifibrd's breast had perhaps never been free from the 
 cares of guilt : he had desired honour ; he had loved renown ; 
 but the early development of passion and of talent had ren- 
 dered him, even in boyhood, less single-hearted than Richard 
 now. 
 
 Clifford was triumphant ; he possessed Monina's beloved — - 
 the cause of his disgrace — bound, a prisoner, and wounded. 
 Why then did pain distort his features, and passion flush his 
 brow ? No triumph laughed in his eye, or sat upon his lip. He 
 hated the prince ; but he hated and despised himself. He 
 played a dastardly and a villain's part ; and shame awaited 
 even success. The notoriety and infamy that attended on him 
 (exaggerated as those things usually are, in his own eyes), 
 made him fear to meet, in the neighbouring villages or towns, 
 any noble cavalier who might recognise him ; even if he saw a 
 party of horsemen on the road he turned out of it, and thus 
 got entangled among by-paths in an unfrequented part of the

 country. They continued the same fast career for several 
 hours, till they entered a wild dark forest, where the inter- 
 minable branches of the old oaks met high-arched over-head, 
 and the paths were beset with fern and underwood. The road 
 they took was at first a clear and open glade, but it quickly 
 narrowed, and branched off in various directions ; they followed 
 one of its windings till it abruptly closed : the leader then 
 reined in, and Clifford's voice was heard. Years had elapsed 
 since it had met Eichard's ear ; the mere, as it were, abstract 
 idea of Clifford was mingled with crime and hate ; his voice, his 
 manner, his look were associated with protestations of fidelity ; 
 or, dearer still, the intercourse of friendship and youthful gaiety ; 
 no wonder that it seemed a voice from the grave to betrayed 
 York. "Halloo!" cried Clifford, " Clim of the Lyn, my 
 merry man, thou art to track us through the New Forest to 
 Southampton." 
 
 " Please your knightshlp," said a shaggy-headed fellow, " our 
 way is clear, I am at home now : but, by Saint George, we 
 must halt ; a thirty miles' ride since matins, his fast unbroken, 
 would have made Ilobin Hood a laggard." 
 
 ""What would you eat here ?" cried Clifford; "a etoup of 
 canary and beef were blessings for the nonce ; but we must get 
 out of this accursed wilderness into more Christian neighbour- 
 hood before we find our hostelry." 
 
 Clim of the Lyn grinned. " To a poor forester," said he, 
 "the green-wood is a royal inn; vert and venison, your 
 worship, sound more savoury than four smoky walls, and a 
 platter of beef brought in mine host's left hand, while his right 
 already says — 'Pay ! ' " 
 
 " They would feed me with mine own venison in way of 
 courtesy, even as the Lion Heart, my namesake and ancestor, 
 was feasted of old ; mine — each acre, each rood, and every 
 noble stag that pastures thereon ; but I am not so free as they ; 
 and, mine though this wild wood be, I must thank an outlaw 
 ere I dine upon my own." 
 
 Thus thought Eichard ; and at that moment, with his limbs 
 aching through their bondage, and with throbbing temples, 
 liberty in the free forest seemed worth more than a kingdom. 
 The bright sun was high — the sky serene — the merry birds 
 were carolling in the brake — the forest basked in noon-day, 
 while the party wound along the shady path beneath. The 
 languid frame of York revived ; at first to pain alone, for 
 memory was serpent-fanged. What bird-lime was this to 
 ensnare the royal eagle ! but soon Despair, which had flapped 
 her harpy wings across his face, blinding him, fled away ; Hope

 a^oke, and in lier train, scliemes of escape, freedom, and a 
 renewal of tlie struggle. 
 
 Meanwhile they threaded many a green pathway, and, after 
 another hour's ride, arrived at the opening of a wide grassy 
 dell; a deer, "a stag of ten," leaped from his ferny bed and 
 bounded away ; a herd of timid fawns, just visible in the dis- 
 tance, hurried into the thicket ; while many a bird flew from 
 the near sprays. Hero the party halted ; first they unbitted 
 their steeds, and then dismounted the prisoners, binding them 
 for security's sake to a tree. Richard was spared this degrada- 
 tion, for still he was a prince in Clifford's eyes ; and his extreme 
 physical weakness, caused by his blow, made even the close 
 watching him superfluous. He was lifted from his horse, and 
 placed upon the turf, and there left. While some of his guards 
 went to seek and slay their repast, others led their animals to a 
 brook which murmured near; all were variously and busily em- 
 ployed. Clifford alone remained ; he called for water ; evidently 
 he was more weary than he chose to own ; he took off his 
 casque : his features were ghastly : there was a red streak upon 
 his brow, which was knit as if to endurance, and his lips were 
 •white and quivering. Never had crime visited with such 
 torment ill-fated man ; he looked a Cain after the murder ; the 
 Abel he had killed was his own fair fame — the ancestral honour 
 of his race. How changed from when E-ichard last saw him, 
 but two years before ; his hair was nearly grey, his eyes hollow, 
 his cheeks fallen in ; yet, though thin to emaciation, he had lost 
 that delicacy and elegance of feature that had characterized 
 him. Almost without reflection, forgetting his own position in 
 painful compassion, the prince exclaimed, *' Thou art an unhappy 
 man. Sir Robert?" The knight replied with a ghastly smile, 
 which he meant to be disdainful. "But now," continued 
 Hichard, " while thy visor screened thy face, I was on the point 
 of taunting thee as a coward, of defying thee to mortal combat ; 
 but thou art miserable, and broken-hearted, and no match 
 for me." 
 
 Clifibrd's eyes glared, his hand was upon his sword's hilt : he 
 recollected himself, replying, " You cannot provoke me, sir, you 
 are my prisoner." 
 
 •'' Thy victim, E.obin ; though once saved by thee : but that is 
 past, and there is no return. The blood of Stanley, and of a 
 hundred other martyrs, rolls between us : I conquer my own 
 nature, when even for a moment I look upon their murderer." 
 
 The weakness of the prince gave a melancholy softness to his 
 voice and manner ; the deep pity he felt for his fallen friend 
 imparted a seraphic expression to his clear open countenance.

328 A PRISONEE. 
 
 Clififoi'd writhed with pain. Clifford, who, though not quick to 
 feel for others, was all sense and sensitiveness for himself : and 
 how often in the world do we see sensibility attributed to indi- 
 viduals, whose show of feeling arises from excessive susceptibility 
 to their own sorrows and injuries ! Clifford wished to" answer — 
 — to go away — he was spell-bound ; his cowering look first 
 animated Richard to an effort, which a moment before he would 
 have ridiculed. " Wherefore," said he, " have you earned all 
 men's hate, and your own to boot ? Are you more honoured 
 and loved than in Brussels ? Scorn tracks you in your new 
 career, and worst of all, you despise yourself." 
 
 " By St. Sathanas and his brood!" fiercely burst from the 
 knight. Then he bit his lip, and was silent. 
 
 " Yet, Clifford, son of a noble father, spare yourself this 
 crowning sin. I have heard from travelled men, that in 
 Heathenesse the unbaptized miscreant is true to him whose 
 hospitality he has shared. There was a time when my eyes 
 brightened when I saw you ; when the name of Eobin was a 
 benediction to be. You have changed it for the direst curse. 
 Yours are no common crimes. Poremost in the chronicles, your 
 name will stand as a type and symbol of ingratitude and treason, 
 written with the blood of Fitzwater and Stanley. But this is 
 not all. The young and defenceless you destroy : you have 
 stood with uplifted dagger over the couch of a sleeping man." 
 
 Clifford had fostered the belief that this vilest act of his life, 
 to which he had been driven rather by fierce revenge than hope 
 of reward, was a secret. A moment before he had advanced 
 with hasty and furious glances towards his enemy. Scarcely 
 had the words passed York's lips, than a kind of paralysis came 
 over him. His knees knocked together : his arms fell nerveless 
 to his side. 
 
 " O, man !" continued York, "arouse thy sleeping faculties. 
 Bid the fiend who tortures thee avaunt ! Even now, at the 
 word, he feels his power over thy miserable soul waver. By 
 Him who died on the Cross, I conjure him to leave thee. Say 
 thou ' amen ' to my adjuration, and he departs. Cast off' the 
 huge burthen of guilt : deliver thy soul into the care of holy 
 men. As thy first act, depart this spot : leave me. It is I 
 who command — Richard of York, thy sovereign. Begone ; 
 or kneeling at my feet, seek the grace thou hasfc so dearly 
 forfeited." 
 
 For a moment it almost seemed as if the wretched man were 
 about to obey ; but at the moment his groom came from the 
 spring, where he had been watering his horse. The sight of 
 another human being, to witness his degradation, awoke him to

 frenzy. H^e called aloud, *' How now, sirrali ! Why, unbit 
 Drair'on? Brinj^ liim here. I must begone." 
 
 " He can't carry your honour a mile," said the fellow. 
 
 " A miracle," cried Eichard ; " you repent, Sir Robert." 
 
 " As Lucifer in hell ! Look to the prisoner." Clifford vaulted 
 on his horse : his head was bare, his eyes wild and bloodshot. 
 Clapping spurs to the jaded animal's side, he put him to his 
 speed, and was gone. 
 
 " His fit is on him ! " cried his attendant, " and what are we 
 to do? He rides a race with the fiend, leaving us to do both 
 their works." More whisperingly he muttered, " Hold Duke 
 Eichard in bonds against his will may I not. He gave me gold 
 in Flanders ; he is a king's son and a belted knight, and I a 
 poor servitor." 
 
 Eichard had conceived a faint hope of working on Clifford's 
 manifest remorse, and enlisting him again under the banner of 
 the White Eose. His wonder was great when he saw him flying 
 through the forest with uncovered head and dishevelled hair ; 
 the bridle of his horse in the groom's hand, while the wearied 
 animal, spurred to speed, threw up his head, snorting with fear. 
 Not a moment was to be lost, the prince flew to his comrades in 
 captivity. Already Heron and O'Water had their bonds cut by 
 the sword of which he possessed himself. Heron, in whose 
 two arms lay his chief strength, and O'Water, at home in a 
 fray, fired with the desire of liberty and life, got speedy hold of 
 battle-axes, and stood at bay. Skelton, the next made free, 
 began to run ; but finding his flight was solitary, he secured a 
 bow and arrows, and betook himself to a short, sure aim from 
 behind a tree, while he offered up another sigh to the memory 
 of Trereife. Astley threw himself foremost before his master, 
 unarmed. The weapons of their guard were chiefly in a heap, 
 and these, defended by the enfranchised prisoners, were useless 
 to them. Headed by Clifford's groom, who stood in salutary 
 awe of shedding royal blood, a parley commenced. He en- 
 treated Eichard to submit ; he told him that the whole country 
 was in arms against him, his way back to his army beset, the 
 sea-coasts strictly guarded. What then could he do ? 
 
 " Die, in arms and at liberty. Stand back, sirs ; what would 
 you do with me ? Your guilty captain has deserted you ; is 
 there one of your number who will raise his accursed weapon 
 against a king and a knight ?" 
 
 Clym of the Lyn, and another outlawed forester (Chfford in 
 mustering a troop had gathered together all manner of wild 
 companions), now appeared dragging in a fat buck. Clym 
 grinned when he saw the altered state of things : ''Come, my

 men," be said, " it is not for us to fight King IT^nry's battles ; 
 the more majesties tbere be in England, tbe merrier for us, I 
 trovr : and the wider and freer the range of the kino; of the New 
 Forest. Pat up your rapiers, and let us feast like brethren ; ye 
 may fall to with your weapons afterwards. Or, if it please your 
 grace to trust to me, I will lead you where none of the king's 
 men will follow." 
 
 " Wilt thou guide me back to Taunton ?" asked the prince. 
 
 *' Not for my cap full of rose nobles," replied the outlaw ; 
 " the way is beset : and trust me your worship's men are scat- 
 tered far and wide ere this. You are a tall fellow, and I should 
 ill like to see you in their gripe. Be one of us ; you shall -be 
 king of the Greenwood-shade ; and a merrier, freer m.onarch than 
 he who lives at Westminster." 
 
 "Hark!" the word, spoken in a voice of alarm, made the 
 party all ear. There was a distaat tramp — every now and then 
 a breaking of bushes — and a whole herd of deer came bounding 
 up the glade in flight. A forester who had rambled further than 
 the rest, rushed back, saying, " Sixty yeomen of the royal guard ! 
 They are coming hitherward. Sir Harry de Vere leads them — I 
 know his bright bay horse."

 It had been the policy of Richard's captors to have remained to 
 deliver up their prisoners to a stronger force. But most of them 
 were outlaws by profession, who held the king's men in instinc- 
 tive horror : these were the first to fly ; the panic spread ; those 
 who had no cause to fear fled because they saw others do so. 
 In a moment the sward was cleared of all save the prisoners, 
 who hastily bridled their horses, and followed York down a 
 narrow path into a glen, in an opposite direction from the

 approacLing troop. With vrbat speed they might they made 
 their way through the forest, penetrating its depths, till they 
 got completely entangled in its intricacies. They proceeded for 
 several hours, but their jaded horses one by one foundered : they 
 ■were in the most savage part of the wood*^: there was no begin- 
 ning nor end to the prospect of knotted trunks, which lifted their 
 vast leafv burthen into the air; here wns safety and needful 
 repose. Eichard, animated to a sudden effort, could now hardly 
 keep his seat : the state of their animals was imperative for a 
 halt ; so here, in a wild brake, they alighted near a running 
 brook ; and here O'Water slew a buck, while Astley and Skelton 
 unbridled their horses, and all set about preparing a most need- 
 ful repast. Evening stole upon them before it was concluded ; 
 the slant sun-beams lay in golden glory on the twisted ivy-grown 
 trunks, and bathed the higher foliage"'in radiance. By the time 
 their appetites were satisfied, Heron and Skelton were discovered 
 to be in a sound sleep ; it were as well to follow their example ; 
 neither men nor horses could proceed without repose ; darkness 
 also afforded best safety for travelling. It was agreed that they 
 should pursue their way at midnight ; and so, stretched on tho 
 grassy soil, peace and the beauty of nature around them, each 
 gave himself up to a slumber which, at that extremity of fatigue, 
 needed no courting. 
 
 All slept, save the prince ; he lay in a state of feverish dis- 
 quietude, looking at the sky through tlie leafy tracery overhead, 
 till night massed and confused every object. Darkest thoughts 
 thronged his mind ; loss of honour, desertion of friends, the fate 
 of his poor men : he was to have devoted himself to them, but a 
 stream, driven by a thundering avalanche from its course, had 
 as much power as he to oppose the circumstances that had 
 brought him from his camp near Taunton, to this secluded spot. 
 For an interval he gave himself up to a tumult of miserable 
 ideas, till from the grim troop some assumed a milder aspect, 
 some a brighter hue ; and, after long and painful consideration, 
 he arranged such a plan as promised at least to vindicate his own 
 name, and to save the lives of his adherents. Calmed by these 
 thonghts, soothed to repose by the gentle influence of a south 
 wind, and the sweet monotony of rustling leaves and runnino- 
 water, he sank at last into a dreamless sleep. ^ 
 
 A whispering of voices was the first thing that struck his 
 wakening sense : it was quite dark. " Is Master O' Water come 
 back ? " asked Heron. 
 
 " I am here," replied the Irishman. 
 
 " Hast discovered aught? " 
 
 "That the night is dark, and the forest wide," replied

 O'Water ; ** bad we a planet to guide us we miglit hope to 
 reach its skirts. We are Tvorse off than the Spanish Admiral 
 on the western sea, for the compass was a star without a cloud 
 to him." 
 
 " Saint Mary save us ! " said, or rather whined poor Skelton, 
 "our fortunes are slit from top to toe, and no patch-work will 
 make them whole." 
 
 " There is hope at the mouth of a culverin," said O'Water, 
 " or at the foot of the gallows, so that a man be true to himself. 
 I have weathered a worse day, when the Macarthys swore to 
 revenge themselves on the Hoches." 
 
 " And by our Lady's grace," interrupted Eichard, " shall again, 
 worthy mayor. My good fellows, fear nothing, I will save you; 
 the ocean cannot be many miles off, for the sun set at our right 
 hand, and blinded our eyes through the day ; the wind by its 
 mildness is southerly ; we will face it. When once we reach the 
 seaside, the shore of the free, wide ocean, Tudor's power stops 
 short, and ye are safe ; of myself there will then be time to 
 think. Say, shall we proceed now, or give another hour to 
 repose ? " 
 
 All were eager to start, slowly leading their horses through 
 the tangled paths they could find, the quarter whence the wind 
 blew, their only guide ; morning found them toiling on, but 
 morning diminished half their labours ; and, as the birds twit- 
 tered, and the east gleamed, their spirits rose to meet and con- 
 quer danger. O'Water was in his native element, that of hair- 
 breadth escape and peril. As to Heron and Skelton, they might 
 have flagged, but for Eichard ; he flattered their pride, raised 
 their hopes, making weariness and danger a plaything and a jest. 
 As the sun mounted in the sky, their horses showed many a sign 
 of weariness ; and in spite of a store of venison, which the care- 
 ful Skelton had brought away with him, they needed refresh- 
 ment ; each mile lengthened to ten ; each glade grew intermin- 
 able in their eyes ; and the wide forest seemed to possess all 
 England in its extent. Could the prince's body have conquered 
 his mind, the White Eose had indeed drooped ; he was parched 
 with fever, and this, preying on his brain, made him the victim 
 of conflicting thoughts : his heart, his imagination, were in his 
 deserted camp ; even fair Xatherine, awaiting tidings of him in 
 her far retreat, had not such power to awaken anguish in his 
 heart, as the idea of Henry's vengeance exercised on his faithful, 
 humble friends, whose father and protector he had called him- 
 self. There was disease in the fire and rapidity with which these 
 ideas coursed through his mind ; with a strong will he overcame 
 them, bent on accomplishing his present purpose, and rescuing

 these chief rebels, Avhose lives were most endangered, before he 
 occupied himself with the safety of the rest. 
 
 At length, at noon, his quick ear caught a heavy, distant roar. 
 The trees had begun to be more scattered : they reached the 
 verge of the forest ; they were too weary to congratulate each 
 other ; before them was a rising ground which bounded their 
 view ; some straggling cottages crowned the height ; slowly 
 they reached the hill-top, and there beheld stormy ocean, clip- 
 ping in the circular coast with watery girdle ; at a crow's flight 
 it might be a mile distant. A few huts and a single black boat 
 spotted in one place the'else desert beach ; a south wind swept 
 the sea, and vast surges broke upon the sands ; all looked bleak 
 and deserted. 
 
 They stopped at a cottage-door, inquiring the road ; they heard 
 there was one, which went three miles about, but that the plain 
 at their feet was intersected bv wide ditches, which their fagged 
 animals could not leap. Moreover, what hope of putting out to 
 sea, in opposition to the big noisy waves which the wind was 
 hurrying towards shore ! It were safest and best to take a short 
 repose in this obscure village. Heron and Skelton entered the 
 poor inn, while Richard waited on his horse, striving to win him 
 by caresses to taste the food he at first refused. Heron, who 
 was warm-hearfred with all his bluster, brought the prince out a 
 flagon of excellent wine, such as by some chance — it might be a 
 wreck — the tide had wafted from the opposite coast : Eichard 
 v.as too ill to drink ; but, as he stood, his arm on his poor steed's 
 neck, the creature looked wistfully up in his face, averting his 
 mouth from the proffered grain ; half-play fully his master held 
 out to him the wide-mouthed flagon, and he drank with such 
 eagerness, that Eichard vowed he should have another bottle, 
 and, buying the host's consent with gold, filled a large can from 
 the wine-cask ; the beast drank, and, had he been a Christian 
 man, could not have appeared more refreshed. The prince, for- 
 getful of his pains, was amusing himself thus, when Skelton, pale 
 and gasping, came from the house, and voiceless through fear, laid 
 one hand on his leader's arm, and with the other pointed : too 
 soon the hapless fugitive saw to what he called his attention, 
 xilong the shore of the sea a moving body was perceptible, 
 approaching towards them from west to east, which soon showed 
 itself to be a troop of horse soldiers. Eichard gave speedy order 
 that his friends should assemble and mount, while he continued 
 to watch the proceedings of the enemy. 
 
 They were about two hundred strong — they arrived at the 
 huts on the beach, and the prince perceived that they were 
 making dispositions to leave a part of their number behind.

334 A DILEMMA. 
 
 Fifty men -were selected, and posted as patrol — the rest then, 
 moved forward, still towards the east. By this time the remain- 
 ing fugitives had mounted, and gathered in one spot — the vil- 
 lagers also were collecting — Skelton's teeth chattered — he asked 
 an old woman if there were any sanctuary near. 
 
 " Ay, by our Lady, is there," replied the dame, " sixteen miles 
 along the coast is the monastery of Beanlieu. A sanctuary for 
 princes ; by the same token that the Lady Margaret, Saint 
 Henry's queen, lived safely therein spite of the wicked Yorkists, 
 who would have taken her precious life." 
 
 Kichard turned quickly round as the woman spoke and heard 
 her words, but again his eyes were attracted to the coast. As 
 the troop were proceeding along the sands, the little knot of 
 horsemen perched upon the hill caught the attention of a 
 soldier. He rode along the lines, and spoke to the commanding 
 oiScer ; a halt ensued, "We are lost," cried Skeltou, ""we are 
 taken, Lord ! Lord ! "will they grant us our lives ? " 
 
 " These trees are tempting, and apt for hanging," said 
 O'Water, with the air of a connoisseur. 
 
 " Oh, for Bewley, — for Bewley, let us ride ! " exclaimed 
 Skelton, longing to go, yet afraid of separating himself from his 
 companions. 
 
 Still the prince watched the movements of the adverse part}^. 
 Ten men were detached, and began to advance inland — " Oh, 
 dear, my lord," cried Astley, " betake yourself to the forest — 
 there are a thousand ways of baffling these men. I will meet 
 tliem, and put them to fault. Hide, for my Lady's sake, ride ! " 
 
 " Master Astley is a cunning gentleman," said Skelton ; '* our 
 horses are a-weary, and a little craft would help us mightily." 
 
 Still Eichard's eyes were fixed on the troopers — the men 
 advanced as far as a broad, deep stream, which intersected the 
 plain ; here they hesitated ; one of the best mounted leaped 
 across, the others drew back, seeking along the steep, shelving 
 banks for a ford, or a narrowing of the stream. The eyes of the 
 troop on the shore were now turned upon their comrades. " Our 
 time is come," cried Eichard ; " back to the forest." One step 
 took them down the other side of the hill, hiding sea and beach 
 and enemj" from their ej'-es, and screening them also from observ- 
 ation. They soon reached the forest, and entered its shade ; 
 and then proceeded along just within its skirts. "Whither? " 
 respectfully O'Water asked, after Skelton had for some time 
 been muttering many a hint concerning sanctuar3^ 
 
 "To Beaulieu," said the prince. "We are barred out from 
 the ocean — we are beset at land — the little island ycleped sanc- 
 tuary is all that is left to ye. God speed us safely hither."

 Eicliard's horse ^vas lively and refreslied after liis generous 
 draught, but these of the others flagged. The prince exerted 
 himself to keep up the spirits of all ; he rallied Skelton, spoke 
 comfort to Astley, and* good hope to Heron. The sturdy 
 apprentice of danger, flight, and trouble, O'Water, treated it all 
 as a matter of course — even hanging, if it so chanced, was but a 
 likely accident — the others needed more encouragement. Astley 
 feared for his lord, even to an appearance of timidity, whicli, 
 though disinterested, had a bad efiect on the others. Heron 
 complained bitterly that his dinner had been left unfinished ; 
 vt^hile the poor tailor, now fancying that he would run away 
 from all, now fearful of solitary misadventure, kept up a garru- 
 lous harangue, of which terror was the burthen and the sum, 
 Bichard's voice was cheerful, his manner gay ; but, placing his 
 hand on Astley, it felt scorching ; every moment it required 
 more energy to throw ofi' the clinging lethargy that fell upon 
 him. It was again evenino^ — a circumstance that had caused 
 them to enter deeper into the forest ; and it was to be feared 
 they had lost their way. All were weary — all, save Richard, 
 hungry. The breeze had died away ; the air was oppressive, 
 and more and more it felt like a load intolerable to the prince's 
 burning brow. IS[ight began to close in so very dark, that the 
 horses refused to go forward. Suddenly a roaring sound arose, 
 which was not the sea; and, but that the atmosphere was so 
 still, the wanderers would have said that it was a fierce wind 
 among the trees. Such must it be, for now it came nearer ; like 
 living things, the vast giants of the forest tossed their branches 
 furiously ; and entire darkness and sudden pouring rain revealed 
 the tempest, which their leafy prison had before hidden — all was 
 so instantaneous, that it would seem that nature was undergoing 
 some great revulsion in her laws. The prince's horse snorted 
 and reared, while O'Water's dashed furiously on, striking against 
 a tree, and throwing his rider, from whose lips there escaped a 
 shriek. What would have been the last overflowing drop in the 
 bitter cup to a weak mind, restored Eichard — lassitude and 
 despondency vanished. In an instant he was off" his horse at 
 O'Water's side, speaking in his own cheerful, kind voice. 
 " Waste no moment on me," cried the generous mayor. "My 
 leg is broken — I can go no further — speed you, your highness, 
 to the sanctuary." 
 
 This was the end of hope — the raging storm, the disabled 
 man, dark night, and Eichard's resolve not to desert his follower, 
 all were causes of terror and of despair. 
 
 A voice in the wood was heard calling aloud ; no answer could 
 be returned ; it was repeated, and Astley went forward to recon-

 noitre — even an enemy were help in such disaster, yet Heron 
 and Skelton implored him to remain. Another halloo llichard 
 answered ; for he recognized Astley's voice, who in the dark 
 could not find his way back. He cam£ at last, accompanied by 
 a monk — this was heaven's favour revealed ; for the holy man 
 was a hermit, and his poor cell was near : poor indeed was it, 
 built with logs, the interstices filled with mud ; a bed of dried 
 leaves was nearly all the furniture. The hermit had gone on 
 first, and lit a torch ; as they might, they bore4 along poor 
 O'Water, and placed him in his agony on the low couch. The 
 hermit looked inquisitively on all the party, neglecting to answer 
 Skelton, who asked for the hundredth time the distance to 
 Beaulieu. 
 
 Eichard still occupied himself with the mayor, endeavouring 
 to discover if the limb were broken. " By your leave, your 
 grace," said the hermit, " I am somewhat of a chirurgeon ; I 
 boast of my cures of horses, and have saved a Christian man ere 
 now." 
 
 Scarcely did the prince remember to wonder at the title by 
 .which the unknovsn addressed him. By our Lady's love he 
 besought him to attend to his friend. " Trust me," said the 
 hermit, "I will not fail ; but you, my lord, must not tarry here ; 
 t]ie forest is beset with troops; but for night and storm, you 
 would hardly attain Beaulieu in safety. It is but two miles dis- 
 tant : I will guide your highness thither ; and then return to 
 your follower. Have faith in me, my lord ; I have served your 
 royal uncle, and was enlisted under your banner last year in 
 Xent. I made a shift to escape, and took sanctuary ; but the 
 stone walls of a monastery are little better than those of a 
 prison ; so I betook me to the woods. Oh, I beseech you, waste 
 no time : I will return to your follower: he is safe till then." 
 
 " Direct us, and I will thank you," replied Eichard; "but you 
 shall not desert your patient even for a moment." 
 
 There was no alternative but to comply : the man gave as 
 clear instructions as he might, and Eichard again set forward 
 with his dmiinished party. They were long entangled by trees ; 
 and it was now quite night : the excitement over, the prince had 
 drooped again. Even this interval was full of peril — a tramp of 
 steeds was heard : they drew up among the trees ; a party of 
 horsemen passed ; one — could it be the voice of the subtle Frion ? 
 — said, "At the end of this glade we shall see the abbey spires. 
 Well I know the same ; for Avhen Queen Margaret " 
 
 This speaker was succeeded by a woman's voice : yet greater 
 wonder, she spoke in Spanish, in unforgotten accents — Eichard's 
 heart stood still, as he heard them ; but soon both voice and

A DILEMMA. 337 
 
 tramp of steeds grew faiut ; and his brain, becoming more and 
 more bewildered, allowed no thought to enter, save the one fixed 
 there even in delirium. The fugitives continued to linger in this 
 spot until it was probable that the travellers should have arrived. 
 True to the information they had overheard, the forest opened 
 at the end of the glade into a leafy amphitheatre ; an avenue was 
 opposite, which led to the abbey gates, whose Gothic spires, 
 buttresses and carved arches, rose above the tufted trees in dark 
 masses. One end of the building was illuminated — that was 
 the church, and the pealing organ stole mournfully on the night, 
 sounding a Miserere ; the chaunting of the monks mingled with 
 the harmonious swell, adding that pathos, that touch of solemn, 
 unutterable sentiment, which perhaps no music, save that of 
 the human voice, possesses. Richard's companions were rough- 
 suited, vulgar-minded ; but they were Catholic and religious 
 men, and were awe-struck by this voice from heaven reaching 
 them thus in their desolation; a voice promising safety and 
 repose to their harassed, vrearied bodies. 
 
 A few steps carried them to the very spot ; the bell was 
 rung, the gate was opened, sanctuary was claimed and afforded. 
 Skeiton sprang forward; the other two hung back; but, on 
 a sign from Eichard, they also passed the sacred threshold 
 *' Farewell, my friends," he said, " a short farewell. Astley, I 
 charge you wait for me. Sir priest, close the gate." 
 
 The word was said, the order obeyed, Eichard was left alone 
 in darkness. " Now for my task — for my poor trusty fellows. 
 The work of murder cannot yet have begun : my life pays for 
 all. Yet awhile bear me up, thou fainting spirit ; desert not 
 Eichard's breast till his honour be redeemed ! " 
 
 Vain prayer!— "I must repose," he thought; "it is of no 
 avail to urge nature beyond herself; a few minutes, and I am 
 strong." He dismounted, and, with a sensation of deHcious 
 relief, threw himself at his length on the wet grass, pressing the 
 dank herbage to his fevered brow. At first he felt recovered ; 
 but in a few minutes strong spasms shot through his frame ; and 
 these yielded to a feebleness, that forced him to sink to the 
 ground, when he endeavoured to rise : he forgot his situation, 
 the near abbey, his friends ; he forgot wherefore, but he remem- 
 bered that his presence was required somewhere, and with 
 a resolved effort he rose and staggered towards his horse— he 
 fell. " A little sleep, and I shall be well." This was his last 
 thought, and he lay in a state between slumber and stupor upon 
 the earth.

 CHAPTEE XLVIII. 
 
 CAPTUEE OF KATHEBINE. 
 
 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, 
 Injurious distance should not stop my way ; 
 For then, despite of space, I would be brought 
 To limits far remote, where thou dost stay. 
 
 Shakspeare, 
 
 There is a terror whose cause is unrevealed even to its victim, 
 which makes the heart beat wildly, and we ask the voiceless 
 thing wherefore ; when the beauty of the visible universe 
 sickens the aching sense ; when we beseech the winds to com- 
 fort us, and we implore the Invisible for relief, which is to speed 
 to us from afar. We endeavour, in our impotent struggle with 
 the sense of coming evil, to soar beyond the imprisoning atmo- 
 sphere of our own identity ; we call upon the stars to speak to 
 us, and would fain believe that mother earth, with inorganic 
 voice, prophesies. Driven on by the mad imaginings of a heart 
 hovering between life and death, we fancy that the visible frame 
 of things is replete with oracles. Or is it true ; and do air 
 and earth, divined by the sorrow-tutored spirit, possess true 
 auguries? At such dread hour we are forced to listen and 
 believe : nor can we ever afterwards, in common life, forget our 
 miserable initiation into the mysteries of the unexplained laws 
 of our nature. To one thus aware of the misfortune that awaits 
 her, the voice of consolation is a mockery. Yet, even while she 
 knows that the die is cast, she will not acknowledge her intimate 
 persuasion of ill ; but sits smiling on any hope brought to her, 
 as a mother on the physician who talks of recovery while her 
 child dies. 
 
 The Lady Catherine had yielded to [Richard's wishes, because 
 ehe saw that he really desired her absence. Alone in a monas- 
 tery, in a distant part of Cornwall, she awaited the fatal tidings, 
 'wjiich she knew must come at last She was too clear-sighted 
 mot to be aware, that the armed power of a mighty kingdom, 
 «uch as England, must crush at once his ill-organized revolt. 
 ;She was prepared for, and ready to meet, all the disasters and

 miraillations of defeat ; but not to be absent from lier liusband at 
 this crisis. She ordered horses to be kept perpetually in readi- 
 ness, that she might proceed towards him on the first intimation 
 of change and downfall. She watched from the highest tower of 
 her abode, the arrival of messengers : before she dared open her 
 letters, she read in their faces, what news of Eichard ? It was 
 a bitter pang to hear that Plantagenet was dangerously wounded ; 
 that the prince had advanced further forward, at the head of 
 his rabble soldiers. 
 
 She had no friends, save humble ones, and very few of these : 
 they borrowed their looks from her, yet hoped more than she 
 did. Qaickly she was aware of a change in them : they spoke 
 in a low, subdued voice, as if awe-struck by some visitation of 
 destiny. That very day letters arrived from the prince : they 
 ■were of ancient date, nor could she lay his terms of endearment 
 and cheering to her heart and be consoled. In the afternoon a 
 torn, soiled billet was brought her from Edmund. In spite of 
 his wound, he had dragged himself as far as Lauuceston, on his 
 way to her. Forced to stop, he sent her tidings of all he knew 
 — Eichard's mysterious flight, Henry's bloodless victory, the 
 eagerness the king expressed to learn where she was, and the 
 despatching of troops in search of her. He besought her to fly. 
 It might be hoped that the prince had escaped beyond sea, whi- 
 ther she must hasten ; or falling into his enemy's hands, she 
 would never see him more. 
 
 Perplexed and agitated, knowing that dishonour would result 
 from Richard's strange disappearance, yet persuaded that he had 
 some ulterior view which it behoved her not to thwart, she hesi- 
 tated what step to take. 
 
 An incident occurred to end her uncertainty. Suddenly, in 
 the evening, Monina stood before her. Monina came with the 
 safety -laden Adalid, to bear her to the shores of Burgundy. 
 She brought the history of the fraud practised upon York, of 
 the ambush laid for his life, of his escape, and the arrival, " 
 immediately succeeding to hers, of his followers at the Abbey of 
 Beaulieu ; how the pawing and trampling of a horse at the 
 gates had brought out the monks, who discovered the hapless 
 prince senseless on the dark sod. He was carried in, and 
 through her care his name was entered in the sanctuary. She 
 had attended on his sick couch two days and nights, when his 
 first return to reason was to implore her to seek Katherine, to 
 carry her beyond Tudor's power, out of the island prison. Her 
 father's caravel was hovering on the coast. A favouring south- 
 east wind bore her to these shores : she came at his desire : the 
 Adalid was there, and she might sail, not to Burgundy, but eyea

 to the spot wliich harboured Eichard. She also could take sanc- 
 tuary in Beaulieu. 
 
 The monastery in which the duchess of York had taken refuge 
 ■vras situated on St. Michael's Mount, not far from the Land's 
 End. The land projects romantically into the sea, forming a 
 little harbour called Mount's Bay. Towards the land the accli- 
 vity is at first frradual, becoming precipitous towards the sum- 
 mit : now, at hij^h water, the tide flows between the rock and 
 the land, but it was in those days connected by a kind of natural, 
 rocky causeway. Towards the sea it is nearly perpendicular. 
 A strong fortress was connected with the church ; and a stone 
 lantern was attached to one of the towers of the church. Not 
 far from the castle, in a cragp^y and almost inaccessible part of 
 the cliff, is situated Saint Michael's Chair, which, on account of 
 its dangerous approach, and the traditions attached to it, became 
 the resort of the pious. Many a legend belonged to this spot. 
 Its thick woods, the hoar appearance of the crags, the wide- 
 spread sea, for ever warring against the land, which had thrust 
 itself out into the watery space, usurping a part of its empire, 
 made it singularly grand ; while the placid beauty of the little 
 bay formed by the rock, and the picturesque grouping of the 
 trees, the straggling paths, and numerous birds, added every 
 softer beauty to the scene. 
 
 Often did Katherine watch the changeful ocean, or turn her 
 eyes to the more grateful spectacle of umbrageous woods, and 
 rifted rock, and seek for peace in the sight of earth's loveliness. 
 All weighed with tenfold heaviness on her foreboding soul. For 
 the first time, they wore to her the aspect of beauty, when now 
 she hoped to leave them. Hopes so soon to fail. A south 
 wind had borne the caravel swiftly into the bay, but the breeze 
 increased to a gale, and even while the ladies were making a 
 few hasty preparations, De Faro had been obliged to slip his 
 moorings, and run out to sea, to escape the danger of being 
 wrecked on a lee shore. With a pang of intense misery, Ka- 
 therine saw its little hull hurry over the blackening waters, 
 and its single sail lose itself amidst the sea-foam. The mariner 
 had even, on anchoring, anticipated a storm ; he had informed 
 his daughter of the probability there was, that he should be 
 driven to seek for safety in the open sea ; l^ut he promised with 
 the first favourable change of wind to return. When would this 
 come ? Fate was in the hour, nor could even Katherine school 
 herself to patience. 
 
 Evening shades gathering round them ; the princess, growing 
 each minute more unquiet and miserable, sought in some kind 
 of activity for relief to her sufferings. ** I will go to Saint

 Michael's Chair," she said ; good spirits for ever hover near the 
 sainted spot ; they will hear and carry a fond wife's prayer to 
 the throne of the Eternal." 
 
 In silence Monina followed the lady. They were both moun- 
 tain-bred, and trod lightly along paths which seemed scarcely to 
 afford footing to a goat. They reached the seat of the rock ; they 
 looked over the sea, whose dark surface was made visible by 
 the sheets of foam that covered it ; the roar of waves was at their 
 feet. The sun went down blood-red, and, in its dying glories, 
 the crescent moon showed first pale, then glowing ; the thou- 
 sand stars rushed from among the vast clouds that blotted the 
 sky ; and the wind tore fiercely round the crag, and howled 
 among the trees. O earth, and sea, and sky ! strange myste- 
 ries ! that look and are so beautiful even in tumult and in storm ; 
 did ye feel pain then, when the elements of which ye are com- 
 posed battled together ? Were ye tortured by the strife of 
 wind and wave, even as the soul of man when it is the prey of 
 passion ? Or were ye unmoved, pain only being the portion of 
 the hearts of the two human beings, who, looking on the 
 commotion, found your wildest rage calm in comparison with 
 the tempest of fear and grief which had mastery over them. 
 
 Sickened by disappointment, impatient of despair, each re- 
 mained, brooding mutely over their several thoughts. 
 
 Poor Katherine ; her dearest wish was set upon sharing in all 
 its drear minutiae the fortune of her lord, her gallant knight, her 
 most sweet Eichard. He was her husband ; he had taken her, 
 timid yet confiding, from the shelter of her father's roof; they 
 had entered the young world of hope and hazard together. 
 Custom, the gentle weaver of soft woman's tenderness, had 
 thrown its silken net over her ; his disasters became hers ; his 
 M'ishes, and their defeat, were also hers. She only existed as 
 a part of him ; while enthusiastic love made her fondly cling 
 even to the worst that betided, as better in its direst shape 
 than any misnamed good fortune that unlinked them. 
 
 " My love, my altar-plighted love ! must I then wake and 
 say no good day to thee ; and sleep, my rest unbenisoned 
 by thy good night ! The simple word, the we, that symbolized 
 our common fate, cut in two, each half a nothing so disjoined." 
 
 While Katherine thus struggled with necessity, Monina was 
 given up to patience. The present hour had fulfilled its fear ; 
 her busy thoughts fashioned a thousand plans for his escape, or 
 tremblingly painted a dark futurity. He was a part of her 
 being, though no portion of herself was claimed by him. She 
 was not his, as a lover or a wife, but as a sister might be ; if in 
 this ill world such heart's concord could exist : a sharing of fate

 and of affection, combined -witli angelic purity. As easily mi^^lit 
 she fancy animal life to survive in her body after the soul had 
 fled, as soon imagine that the beating of her heart could con- 
 tinue -when the living impulse which quickened its palpitations 
 was still, as that he, her childhood's playfellow, the golden 
 dream of her youth, the shrine at which she had sacrificed 
 that youth, should die, and she live on in the widowed world 
 without him. 
 
 The stars glittered over their gentle heads, and the moon 
 went down in the west ; fitful, thread-like rays were shed upon 
 the raging sea, whose heady billows foamed and roared at their 
 feet : both these fair, gentle creatures remained, careless of the 
 wild wind that swept their limbs, or the spray which, high as 
 they stood, besprent their hair : both young, both lovely, both 
 devoted to one, yet confiding in the reality of virtue and purity, 
 trusting fully each other, the one accepting the 'heart's sacrifice 
 which the other unreservedly made, they watched for the 
 Adalid, which, a plaything of the waves, was carried afar. Day 
 dawned before they could resolve to quit this spot ; then they 
 took refuge in the near monastery, and from its towers looked 
 out over the sea. 
 
 A few anxious hours brought the dreaded consummation of 
 their fears. The ascent of a troop of horse up the steep, told 
 Katherine that she was discovered. Their sudden appearance 
 before her proved that she was a prisoner. For the first time 
 she saw the White and Red Rose entwined ; the earl of Oxford 
 was announced to her as their leader, and he soon appeared to 
 claim his prize. 
 
 Katherine received him with dignified sweetness ; she con- 
 quered her ill fate by smiling at its blows, and looked a queen, 
 as she yielded herself a slave. The watching of the night had 
 all disordered her dress, and deranged her golden tresses ; but 
 her wondrous fairness, the soft moulding of her face, her regal 
 throat, and arched open brow, bending over her intelligent, yet 
 soft, blue eyes ; her person majestic, even in its slim beauty, 
 were tokens of a spirit, that in destitution must reign over all 
 who approached it. 
 
 Her first words, to ease the awe-struck earl, were an entreaty 
 to be conducted to the king. She showed more earnest desire 
 than he to present herself to her royal victor. In a very few 
 hours they had descended the Mount, and hastened out of 
 hearing of the roar of the ocean, which had so cruelly deceived 
 her hopes. In her eyes could only be read the mastery she had 
 obtained over her thoughts ; no lurking weakness betrayed fear, 
 or even disappointment, Surely yet she cherished some dear

 expectation ; yet how, lost to liberty, could slie hope to attain 
 it? 
 
 But thus we are, while untamed by years. Youth, elastic and 
 bright, disdains to be compelled. When conquered, from its 
 very chains it forges implements for freedom ; it alights from 
 one baffled flight, only again to soar on untired wing towards 
 some other aim. Previous defeat is made the bridge to pass the 
 tide to another shore ; and, if that break down, its fragments 
 become stepping-stones. It will feed upon despair, and call it a 
 medicine which is to renovate its dying hopes. 
 
 CHAPTEE XLIX. 
 
 RICHARD SURRENDERS. 
 
 For, when Cymocles saw the foul reproach 
 Which him appeached, prick 'd with noble shame 
 And inward grief, he fiercely 'gan approach; 
 Resolved to put away that loathly blame. 
 Or die with honour and desert of fame. 
 
 Spenser. 
 
 After the prince, by the voyage of Monina, had, as he hoped, 
 provided for the escape and safety of the Lady Xatherine, he 
 could not, all weak as he was, remain in repose. 
 
 Prom his early childhood he had been nurtured in the idea 
 that it was his first, chief duty to regain his kingdom ; his 
 friends lived for that single object ; all other occupation was 
 regarded as impertinent or trifling. On the table of his ductile 
 boyish mind, that sole intent was deeply engraved by every hand 
 or circumstance. The base-minded disposition of his rival king 
 adorned his cause with a show of use and the name of virtue. 
 
 Those were days when every noble-born youth carved honour 
 for himself with his sword ; when passes at arms where resorted 
 to whenever real wars did not put weapons in their hands, and 
 men exposed their breasts to shatp-biting steel in wanton sport. 
 Often during his green and budding youth Eichard had gloried 
 in the very obstacles set before him ; to be cast out and forced 
 to redeem his state, was a brighter destiny than to be lapped in 
 the bosom of guarded royalty. The treason of Clifford and the 
 sacrifice of devoted friends but whetted his ambition ; ven-

 geance, the religion of that age, being a sacred duty in his eyes. 
 He had been shaken by Lord Surrey's appeal, but cast the 
 awakened pity off as a debasing weakness. 
 
 The painted veil of life was torn. His name had not armed 
 the nobles of his native land, his cause had not been trumpeted 
 with praise nor crowned by victory ; deserted by foreign allies, 
 unsuccessful in Ireland, he had appeared at the head of a rabble 
 army strong only in wrongs and in revenge. Even these he 
 had abandoned, and with nameless hinds taken sanctuary ; his 
 story was a fable, his name a jeer; he no longer, sq it seemed, 
 existed ; for the appellation of duke of York was to be lost 
 and merged in the disgraceful misnomer affixed to him by the 
 Usurper. 
 
 Eichard was no whining monk to lament the inevitable, and 
 tamely to await the result. To see an evil was to spur him to 
 seek a remedy : he had given up every expectation of reigning, 
 except such as sprung from his right, and faith in the justice of 
 God. But honour was a more valued treasure ; and to his 
 warm heart dearer still was the safety of the poor fellows aban- 
 doned by him. On the third day after his arrival at Beaulieu, 
 he arose from his sick coucb, donned his armour, and, yet pale 
 and feeble, sent to speak with the cavalier who commanded the 
 party that guarded all egress from the abbey. With him he 
 held long parley, in conclusion of which Sir Hugh Luttrel 
 directed three of his followers to be in readiness, and two of his 
 chosen horses to be led to the abbey gates. Eichard took leave 
 of the abbot ; he recommended his poor followers to him, and 
 lightly answered the remonstrance of the holy man, who thought 
 that delirium alone could urge the fugitive to quit the tranquil, 
 sacred spot, where he himself passed his days in quiet, and 
 which held out so secure a protection to the vanquished. His 
 remonstrance was vain ; one word weighed more with Eichard 
 than a paradise of peace. Infamy, dishonour ! No ; even if 
 his people were safe — by throwing himself in the self-same peril 
 to which he had apparently exposed them, that stain were 
 effaced. The very gentleman to whom he had surrendered 
 himself had trespassed on his allegiance to Henry to dissuade 
 him from the fool-hardihood of his adventure. It was a sight 
 of pity to see one so very young walk voluntarily to the sacri- 
 fice ; and the princely mien and youthful appearance of the 
 self-constituted prisoner wrought all to compassion and respect. 
 Por still this fair White Hose was in the very opening flower of 
 manhood : he looked, after such variety of fortune, as if evil not 
 only never had, but never could tarnish the brightness of his 
 spirit or of his aspect j illness had a little enfeebled him, without

 detracting from his youthful beauty, giving rather that softness 
 Avhich made it loveliness, yet painted fairer by his self-immo- 
 lating resolve. 
 
 ' A sweet regard and amiable grace, 
 Mixed with manly sternness did appear,' 
 
 and eagerness withal : for eager he was, even to almost foolish 
 haste, to redeem the lost hours, and establish himself again no 
 runaway. 
 
 With fresh joy he addressed himself to retrace his steps to 
 Taunton. Sanctuary and refuge from death — oh ! how he 
 trampled on the slavish thought. Death was to him a word, a 
 shadow, a phantom to deride and scorn, not arw enemy to grapple 
 with ; disgrace was his abhorred foe, and him he thus over- 
 threw. His resolves, inspired by disdain of permitting one 
 taint to blemish his career, were not the expedients of prudence, 
 but the headlong exploit of daring youth. The iron must indeed 
 have entered our souls, and we be tamed from dear, youthful 
 freedom to age's humble concessions to necessity, before we can 
 bow our head to calumny, smile at the shafts as they rankle in 
 our flesh, and calmly feel that, among the many visitations of 
 evil we undergo, this is one we are compelled to endure. 
 
 Thus he, his gentle guide and followers, travelled towards 
 Taunton. In all prudence, from the moment they left sanctuary, 
 Sir Hugh Luttrel ought to have guarded him closely. But even 
 the staid Sir Hugh forgot this duty ; rather was Richard the 
 enforcer of this journey, than his guard, liichard it was who 
 at night halted unwillingly ; Richard who first cried to horse at 
 morning's dawn ; who, in spite of ill-weather, resisted every 
 delay. As they drew near their bourne, the appellation of 
 Perkin first met the prince's ear ; he was unaware that it had 
 ever been applied to him except by Henry's written proclama- 
 tions. It acted as a galling spur ; for he believed, with youth's 
 incapacity of understanding systematized falsehood, that his 
 presence would put to flight the many-coloured web of invention, 
 which his rival had cast over him to mar his truth and obscure 
 his nobility. 
 
 After three days they drew near Taunton. The stubble fields, 
 the flowery hedges, the plenteous orchards were passed. From 
 a rising ground they looked upon the walls of the town, and the 
 vacant moor where his camp had stood. Richard halted, saying 
 — " Sir knight, I will await you here — do you seek your king : 
 say, I come a voluntary sacrifice, to purchase with drops of my 
 royal blood the baser tide of my poor followers. I demand no 
 more — bid him rear the scaflfold ; let the headsman sharpen the

 axe, to lop off the topmost bough of Plantagenet. The price I 
 ask, is the despised lives of men, who, but that they loved me, 
 vcere incapable of merit or of crime in his eyes. For their 
 humble sakes, like my grandfather York, I am prepared to die. 
 If pledge of this be denied me, I still am free. I wear a sword 
 and will sell my life dearly, though alone." 
 
 Sir Hugh Luttrel was perplexed. He knew the stern nature 
 of his royal master, and how heavily he would visit on him any 
 disappointment in his dearest wish of obtaining possession of his 
 rival's person. The prince had, during their three days' com- 
 panionship, gained great power over him : he felt that he was 
 in truth the son of Edward the Fourth, a man he had never 
 loved (for Sir Hugh was a Lancastrian), but one whom he had 
 feared and obeyed as his sovereign. How could he put slavish 
 force upon his gallant offspring ? He hesitated, till the prince 
 demanded — "Wherefore delay — is there aught else that you 
 ■desire?" 
 
 " You pledge your knightly word," said Sir Hugh, " not to 
 desert this spot ? " 
 
 *' Else wherefore am I here ? — this is idle. Yet, so to content 
 you, I swear by my vow made under the walls of Granada, by 
 our Lady, and by the blessed saints, I will abide here, i 
 
 The knight rode into the town with his followers, leaving 
 young Richard impatient for the hour that was to deliver him to 
 servitude. 
 
 Sir Hugh first sought Lord Dawbeny, requesting him to 
 obtain for him instant audience of the king. " His grace," said 
 the noble, " is at vespers, or about to attend them." 
 
 "I dare not wait till they are said," replied Luttrel, who 
 every minute felt the burthen of responsibility weighing heavier 
 on him. 
 
 *' JSTor I interrupt his majesty — even now he enters the 
 church." 
 
 In haste Sir Hugh crossed the street ; and, as the king took 
 the holy water from the chalice, he knelt before him. The few 
 words he spoke painted Henry's face with exulting gladness. 
 " We thank thee, good Sir Hugh," he said, " and will make our 
 thanks apparent. By the mass, thou hast deserved well of us 
 this day ! Where hast thou bestowed our counterfeit ?" 
 
 "Please your majesty, he awaits your highness's acceptance ot 
 his conditions without the eastern gate." 
 
 " You have placed strong guard over him ?" 
 
 " He pledged his oatli to await my return. He is alone." 
 
 A dark, angry frown chased all glee from Tudor's brow ; 
 bending a stern glance on his erewhile welcome messenger, he

 commanded Lord Wells, liis cousin, to take a strong force and 
 to seize this duke of Runaways. Sir Hugh, timid as he was, in- 
 terfered : driven by respect for his prisoner, and fear of what 
 might ensue, he tried- to enforce York's stipulation. Henry 
 looked on him with scorn, then said, " Truly, cousin, I have 
 vaunted of a bloodless conquest ; so let not the blood of the 
 misborn traitor stain our laurels, nor Sir Luttrel's Duke Perkin 
 shed one precious ruby drop. Say ay to all he asks ; for, as it 
 seems, his demands are as foolish as himself, and need no 
 chaffering. Tell him that his life is safe, but bring him here ; 
 set him within our ward and limitation : do this, while we with a 
 Te Dcum thank our Heavenly Father for his watchful mercies. 
 Sir Hugh, accompany our cousin, and then wend your way whither 
 it please you. We have no pleasure in your presence." 
 
 Thus duped, even by his own generous, proud spirit, the duke 
 of York became a prisoner — delivering up his sword, and yield- 
 ing himself an easy prey to his glad victor. Once, twice, thrice, 
 as he waited the return of Luttrel, it had crossed his mind, not 
 to fly, his vow being pledged, but to remember that he was now 
 free and unconstrained, and would soon be in other's thrall — ■ 
 when farewell to the aspiring thought, the deed of arms, and to 
 the star of his life, to whose idea, now his purpose was accom- 
 plished, he fondly turned. ! — " Poor Katherine," he whispered, 
 " this is the crown, the fated, fallen youth, the seer foretold." 
 In after-times that scene dwelt on his memory ; he called to 
 mind the evening-tide, for the sun was down, and the clouds, 
 lately gold besprent, waxing dun, as the town walls grew high 
 and dark, and the few trees about him waved fitfully in a soft 
 breeze ; that wind was free, and could career over the plain ; 
 what spell bound the noble knight and stalwart steed, that they 
 coursed not also free as it ? 
 
 In a few minutes he was a prisoner — and led within those 
 darksome walls. At first, treated with some observance, he was 
 unaware, as is the case in any new position, with whose circum- 
 stances and adjuncts we are unacquainted, how utterly he had 
 fallen. He was led to no barred prison ; and, for a time, the 
 nobles and knights who flocked, to see him were no bad 
 exchange for the motley crew he had quitted. But, as if in a 
 dream, he felt gather round him impalpable but adamantine 
 walls — chains hung upon his limbs, not the less heavy, because 
 the iron pierced his soul rather than his flesh. He had been a 
 free man ; his name was attended with love and. respect, and 
 his aspect commanded the obedience of men. Now, the very 
 appellation given to him was a mortal insult ; a stranger 
 seemed to be spoken to when he was addressed, and yet he must

 ansvrer. He was never alone ; and night was the sole suspen- 
 sion from the insulting curiosity of the crowd. He must forego 
 himself; grow an impostor in his own eyes ; take on him the 
 shameful name of Perkin : all which native honour, and memory 
 of his princess bride, made trebly stinging. 
 
 To barb the dart came intelligence that the Lady Katherine 
 was a prisoner. King Henry had quitted Taunton, and gone 
 towards Exeter, when, on his arrival there, the earl of Oxford 
 presented the Scottish princess to him. Praises of her won- 
 drous beauty became rife, brought by some of the king's train, 
 returned to Taunton ; praises so excessive and warm as could not 
 have been inspired by celestial beauty in adversity, if not egged 
 on by some adventitious stimulant. It was the fashion to speak 
 of her as the Queen of Loveliness ; as (for beauty's sake the 
 name belonged to her) the fairest White Eose that ever grew 
 on thorny bush. By this name she was mentioned to York ; 
 and it visited his heart as the first gleam of sunshine on his 
 enshadowed misery ; dear was the name of the White Hose to 
 the fallen one. It had been his own in fresh and happy days, 
 when first he showed his prowess among the knights of 
 France and Burgundy. Still louder grew the echo of some 
 mighty voice, that gave forth encomium of the prisoner's bride ; 
 and the smiles with which some spoke, smiles half of wonder 
 half of mockery, told of some secret charm, which at last was 
 openly commented upon. " Again the king saw the fair one 
 yestermorn ; and dallied ere he granted the earnest suit she 
 made, as if he loved to be entreated." 
 
 '* The grave King Henry caught in the net of the wanton 
 boy ! Oh, this were subject for a ballad for the nonce." 
 
 " Blythe news for gentle Perkin ; his wife thrives at court. 
 She takes occasion by too slender a hold, if she raise not her 
 husband from the kitchen to a higher place at court." 
 
 " Now we shall see our the lady the queen jealous of her 
 liege." 
 
 " Our queen? what midsummer's dream is this ? The White 
 Eose will never flower in our court garden." 
 
 To falsify this assertion came the next day a messenger, with 
 command to convey the noble prisoner with all speed to London ; 
 and for the attendance of the Lady Cheney, and the Lady 
 Howard, two noble matrons, to wait on the Lady Katherine, 
 who was about to proceed to Westminster. Smiles and whispers 
 were interchanged ; and, when to this was added, that as much 
 courtesy should be shown the counterfeit youth as might 
 not endanger his safe keeping, the light laugh followed ; though, 
 as if to meet and overthrow the raillery, it was added, this

 was ordered for his royal wife's sake, who was cousin to Eng- 
 land's dear ally, the king of Scotland. These idle tales did not 
 reach York's ear : wherever he showed himself, he enforced 
 such personal respect, that there was no likelihood that any 
 conjecture, linked with his lady's name, would be hazarded 
 before him. He was told that the king entertained her royally ; 
 and when he heard that she was to be presented to his sister, 
 the Queen Elizabeth, a thrill of joy passed into his heart. His 
 sister ! as a boy, he remembered the fair, kind girl, whom he 
 had called his loved and most sweet sister: he knew that she 
 was conscious of his truth, and, though wedded to his rival, 
 loved not her lord. It was a pleasing dream, to fancy these 
 gentle ladies together; to know that, while the one spoke her 
 affection and praise, the other must feel the kindred blood warm 
 in her heart, and proudly, though sadly, acknowledge him her 
 worthy brother.

 The vulgar rabble, fond of any sort of show, were greedy of 
 this new one. In all parts the name of the duke of York, of the 
 counterfeit Perkin, drew a concourse of gazers. The appetite 
 was keenest in London ; and many a tawdry masque and mime 
 was put in motion, to deck the streets through which the de- 
 feated youth was to pass. Yainly ; he entered London at night, 
 and was conducted privately to Westminster. What strange 
 thing was this ? What mark of reality did his very forehead 
 wear, that Henry, so prodigal of contumely on his foes, dared 
 not bring him forward for the public gaze ? One man was put in 
 the stocks for a similar remark ; and on the following day it was 
 suddenly proclaimed, that Perkin would go in procession from 
 Westminster to Saint Paul's, and back again. A troop of horse 
 at the appointed hour left the palace : in the midst of them rode 
 a fair young gentleman, whose noble mien and gallant bearing

 gave lustre to his escort : liis sweet aspect, bis frank soft smile 
 and lively but calm manner, had no trace of constraint or de- 
 basement, " He is unarmed — is that Perkin ? No, the earl of 
 Warwick — he is a prince sure — yet that is he ! " Such murmurs 
 sped around ; at some little distance followed another burlesque 
 procession ; a poor fellow, a Cornishman, was tied to an ass, his 
 face to the tail, and the beast now proceeding lazily, now driven. ^ 
 by sticks, now kicking, now galloping, made an ill-fashioned 
 mirth for the multitude. Whether, as York was not to be dis- 
 graced in his own person, the contumely was to reach him 
 tlirough this poor rogue, or whether the eyes of men were to be 
 drawn from him to the rude mummery which followed, could 
 only be guessed : the last was the effect produced. Hichard 
 heard mass at Saint Paul's, and returned to Westminster un- 
 molested by insult. It seemed but as if some young noble made 
 short pilgrimage from one city to the other, to accomplish a 
 vow. The visit of ill-fated Warwick to the cathedral, before 
 the battle of Stoke, had more in it of humiliating ostentation. 
 
 He returned to the palace of Westminster. A few weeks he 
 spent in mingled curiosity and anxiety concerning his future 
 destiny. It was already accomplished. Modern times could 
 not present anything more regular and monotonous than the 
 way of life imposed upon him. It was like the keeping of a 
 lunatic, who, though now sane, might be momentarily expected 
 to break out in some dangerous explosion, rather than the con- 
 fining of a state-prisoner. Four armed attendants, changed every 
 eight hours, constantly guarded him, never moving, according 
 to the emphatic language of the old chroniclers, the breadth of • 
 a nail from his side. He attended early mass each morning : 
 he was permitted to take one hour's ride on every evening that 
 was not a festival. Two large gloomy chambers, with barred 
 •windows, were allotted him. Among his guards, he quickly per- 
 ceived that the same faces seldom appeared ; and the most 
 rigorous silence, or monosyllabic discourse, was imposed upon 
 them. Harsher measures were perhaps spared, from respect to 
 his real birth, or his alliance with the king of Scotland : yet 
 greater severity had been less tantalizing. As it was, the corpse 
 in the grass-grown grave was not more bereft of intercourse with 
 the sunny world, than the caged duke of York. From his 
 windows, he looked upon a deserted court-yard ; in his rides, 
 purposely directed to unfrequented spots, he now and then saw 
 a few human beings — such name could be hardly bestowed on 
 his stony-faced, stony-hearted guards. 
 
 Hichard was the very soul of sympathy ; he could muse for 
 Jiours in solitude, but it must be upon dear argument, that had

 for its subject tlie pleasures, interests or affections of others. 
 He could not entertain a heartless intercourse. Wherever he 
 saw the human countenance, he beheld a fellow- creature ; and, 
 duped a thousand times, and a thousand times deceived, " still 
 lie must love." To spend the hour in sportive talk ; fondly to 
 interchange the gentle offices of domestic life ; to meet peril and 
 endure misery with others ; to give away himself, and then re- 
 turn to his inner being, laden like a bee with gathered sweets : 
 to pile up in his store-house, memory, the treasured honey of 
 friendship and love, and then away to nestle in the bosom of 
 his own dear flower, and drink up more, or gaily to career the 
 golden fields ; such was his nature : and now — this was worse 
 loneliness ; this commune with the mutes of office ; to be 
 checked by low-born men ; to feel that he must obey the beck 
 of an hireling. A month, interspersed with hopes of change, he 
 had endured the degradation ; now he began to meditate escape. 
 Yet he paused. Where was Katherine ? where his many zealous 
 friends ? 
 
 The Lady Katherine was in an apartment of the palace, whoso 
 arched and fretted roof, and thick buttresses, were well adapted 
 to impart a feeling of comfortable seclusion from the rough 
 elements without. The dulness of dark November was gladdened 
 by a huge wood fire. The little prince of Wales was narrating 
 some strange story of fairyland ; and bluff Harry was setting 
 two dogs to quarrel, and then beating his favourite for not con- 
 quering, which seeing, his sister Margaret drew the animal from 
 him to console and caress it. The gentle queen bent over her 
 embroidery. Listening she was to her favourite Arthur, inter- 
 rupting him with playful questions and exclamations, while Ka- 
 therine now kindly attended to the boy, now turned anxiously 
 at every sound. She rose at last : " Surely vespers are ringing 
 from the abbey. My lord the king promised to see me before 
 vespers." 
 
 " My lord the king is very graciousto you, sweet one," said 
 Elizabeth, i 
 
 " Methinks by nature he is gracious," replied the princess ; 
 •* at least, I have ever found him so. Surely the shackles of 
 state are very heavy, or ere this he would have granted my 
 prayer, which he has listened to so oft indulgently." 
 
 The queen smiled faintly, and again pursued her work with 
 seeming earnestness. Was it jealousy that dimmed the 8!Tk of 
 her growing rosebud by a tear — or what name shall we give to 
 the feeling ? — envy we may not call it, she was too sweetly good 
 — which now whispered, "..Even he, the cold, the stern, is kind 
 to her ; my brother loves her passionately j and many a lance

 lias been broken for lier. Happy girl ; happy in adversity ; 
 ^vhile I, England's miserable queen, am forgotten even by my 
 fellow-prisoner of Sheriff Hutton, poor Warwick ! he might 
 have been my refuge : for the rest, how hard and rocky seem all 
 human hearts to me." Her tears now flowed fast. Katherine 
 saw them : she approached her, saying, " Dear and royal lady, 
 none diould weep, methinks, but only I, whose mate is caged 
 and kept away ; none sigh but poor Kate, whose more than life 
 hangs on state policy ; or is it for him these tears are shed?" 
 
 Still Elizabeth wept. Accustomed to the excess of self- 
 restraint, timid, schooled to patience, but with the proud, fiery 
 spirit of a Plantaganet, tamed, not dead within her, she could be 
 silent, but not speak by halves. The very natural vivacity of 
 her nature made her disdain not to have her will, when once it 
 was awaked. She struggled against her rising feeling; she 
 strove to suppress her emotion ; but at last she spoke ; and 
 once again, after the ten years that had elapsed since her 
 mother's imprisonment, truth was imaged by her words. To 
 none could she have addressed herself better. The life of the 
 Scottish princess had been spent in administering balm to 
 wounded minds : the same soft eloquence, the same persuasive 
 counsels, that took the sting of remorse from her royal cousin's 
 conscience, was spent upon the long-hidden sorrows of the 
 neglected wife, the humbled woman. From her own sensitive 
 mind she culled the knowledge which taught her where and how 
 peace and resignation were to be found. The piety that mingled 
 with her talk was the religion of love ; her philosophy was mere 
 love ; and it was the spirit of love, now kindling the balmy 
 atmosphere of charity to many, now concentred in one point, 
 but ever readv to soothe human suffering with its soft influence, 
 that dwelt upon her lips, and modulated her silver voice. 
 Elizabeth felt as if she had wandered long in a wolf-haunted 
 wild, now suddenly changed to a fairy demesne, fresh and beau- 
 tiful as poet's dream. Timidly she feared to set her untaught 
 feet within the angel-guarded precincts. The first effect of her 
 new friend's eloquence was to make her speak. After years of 
 silence, to utter her very inner thoughts, her woman's fears, her 
 repinings, her aversions, her lost hopes and affections crushed : 
 she spent her bitterest words ; but thus it was as if she emptied 
 a silver chalice of its gall, to be refilled by Katherine with 
 heavenly dew. 
 
 The "weeks of baffled expectation grew into months. It is a 
 dreary portion of our existence, when we set our hearts upon an 
 object which recedes as we approach, and yet entices us on. The 
 kings courtesy and smiles, and evident pleasure in her society,

 gave birth to warm hopes in the bosom of the princess. She 
 had asked to share her husband's prison ; she had besought to 
 be permitted to see him ; it seemed, from Henry's vague but 
 consolatory answers, that to-morrow she would receive even 
 more than her desires. The disappointment of the morrow, 
 which she lamented bitterly at first, then grew into the root 
 whence fresh hopes sprang again, to be felled by the cruel axe, 
 again to shoot forth : the sickening sensation of despair crept 
 over her sometimes ; her very struggles to master it enfeebled 
 her ; and yet she did conquer all but the hard purposes of the 
 tyrant. Now a messenger was to be despatched to Scotland ; 
 now he expected one thence ; now an embassy from Burgundy : 
 he implored her patience, and talked back the smiles into her 
 saddened countenance. He was almost sincere at first, not in 
 his excuses, but in his desire to pleas6 her at any sacrifice ; but 
 this disinterested wish grew soon into a mere grasping at self- 
 gratification. In a little while he hoped she would be per- 
 suaded how vain it was to expect that he should set free so 
 dangerous a rival : and vet he did not choose to extinguish all 
 her anticipations ; for perhaps then she would desire to return 
 to her native country ; and Henry would have sacrificed much 
 to keep her where he could command her society. Thus he 
 encouraged her friendship with the queen, though he wondered 
 how one so wise, so full of reflection and reason as Katherine, 
 could love his feeble-minded wife. 
 
 The king underrated the talents of Elizabeth. This hapless 
 woman had perceived that contention was useless ; she there- 
 fore conceded everything without a struggle. Her energies, 
 spent upon endurance, made her real strength of mind seem 
 tameness ; but Katherine read with clearer eyes. We are all 
 and each of us riddles, when unknown one to the other. The 
 plain map of human powers and purposes, helps us not at all to 
 thread the labyrinth each individual presents in his involution 
 of feelings, desires, and capacities ; and we must resemble, in 
 quickness of feeling, instinctive sympathy, and warm bene- 
 volence, the lovely daughter of Huntley, before we can hope to 
 judge rightly of the good and virtuous among our fellow- 
 creatures. 
 
 The strangest sight of all was to see Henry act a lover's part. 
 At first he was wholly subdued, 
 
 " So easy is t' appease the stormy wind 
 Of malice, in the calm of pleasant womankind." 
 
 Even generosity and magnanimity, disguises he sometimes wore 
 the better to conceal his inborn littleness of soul, almost pos-

 aessed him ; for a moment lie forg^ot liis base exultation in 
 crushing a foe, and for a moment dwelt with genuine pleasure on. 
 the reflection, that it was in his power to gratify her every wish, 
 and to heap benefits on one so lovely and so true. When first 
 she was presented to him, in all the calm majesty of her self- 
 conquering mood, her stainless loveliness had such eflfect, that 
 surely he could deny her nothing ; and when she asked that no 
 foul dishonour should be put upon her lord, he granted almost 
 before she asked : his expressions of service and care were 
 heartfelt ; and she lost every fear as she listened. When 
 custom, which, with man, is the devourer of holy enthusiasm, 
 changed his purer feelings into something he dared not name, 
 he continued to manifest the same feelings, which had bested 
 him so well at first, and to angle with his prey. Though he 
 scarcely knew what he wished, for a thousand worldly motives 
 sufficed to check any dishonourable approach, it was enough that 
 she was there ; that, when she saw him, her countenance lighted 
 up with pleasure ; that with the sweetest grace she addressed 
 her entreaties to his ear ; not in abrupt demands, but in such 
 earnest prayer, such yielding again, to return with another and 
 another argument ; that often he thought, even if he had wished 
 to concede, he would hold out a little longer, that still her sweet 
 voice might address him, still her stately neck be bent imploring 
 as she fixed her blue eyes on him. 
 
 It was very long before the artless girl suspected that he had 
 any other intent but to consent at last to her supplications. As 
 it was as easy to him to lure her on with a greater as a lesser 
 hope, she even fancied that, under certain restrictions, York's 
 freedom might be restored ; and that with him, in some remote 
 country, she might bless Tudor as a generous adversary. 
 Elizabeth was afraid to discover the truth to her, for she also 
 dreaded to lose her, and was afraid that, on the failure of her 
 hopes, she would seek to return to Scotland ; or at least seclude 
 herself from her husband's jailer. Monina first awoke her to 
 the truth. Monina, who had been to Brussels, to consult with 
 the Duchess Margaret and Lady Brampton, and who came back 
 full of projects for her friend's escape, heard with amazement 
 and scorn the false lures held out by Henry ; she impatiently 
 put aside every inducement for delay, and with rash, but 
 determined zeal, framed many a scheme for communicating with 
 him, and contriving means for his flight. 
 
 He himself — the chained eagle — was sick at heart. No word 
 ' — no breath — no hope ! Had all forgotten him ? Was he, yet 
 living, erased from the lists of memory ? Cut off" from the beloved 
 beings in whom he had confided, through their own act — no

 longer a part of their thoughts, their lives, themselves ? Stood 
 he alone in this miserable world, allied to it by hate only — the 
 hate borne to him by his foe ? Such gloomy misgivings were 
 so alien to his nature, that they visited him as cruel iron torture 
 visits soft human flesh. That she — the life of his life, should be 
 false and cold ! Each friend forgetful — Monina — Plantagenet 
 — all — all! Oh, to stretch his quivering frame upon burning 
 coals, had been to slumber on a bed of roses, in comparison with 
 the agony these thoughts administered. His calmer moods, 
 when he believed that, though tardy, they were true, were 
 scarcely less painful. Then the real state of things grew more 
 galling : the bluntness or silence of his keepers ; their imper- 
 turbable or rude resistance to his questions ; the certainty that 
 if one answered graciously — that one he should see no more. 
 Often he felt as if he could not endure his present position one 
 hour longer. Fits of hope, meditations on escape, chequered 
 his days ; so that all was not so dark — but the transition from 
 one emotion to another, each to end in blank despair, tasked his 
 mercurial soul. Patience died within him — he might perish in 
 the attempt, but he would be free. 
 
 Urged by Monina, by her own awakening fears, and above all 
 by the keen burning desire of her heart, the Lady Katherine 
 became very importunate with the crafty monarch to be per- 
 mitted an interview with her lord. Henry was in no mood to 
 grant her request : the thousand designs he had meditated to 
 disgrace his victim, he had given up for her sake, because he 
 would not refuse himself the pleasure of seeing her, and feared 
 to behold aversion and horror mark an aspect hitherto all 
 smiles towards him. The same fear, nurtured by the expres- 
 sions of her tender affection, made him hesitate, ere he should 
 endeavour to convince her that she had misallied herself to an 
 impostor. Indeed, when at last he ventured to frame a speech 
 bearing such a meaning, her answer told him, that if he could 
 have changed the E-oyal York into base-born Perkin, the young 
 and innocent wife would still cling to him to whom she had 
 pledged her rows; to whom she had given himself; whose 
 own, in Heaven's and her own eyes, she unalienably was. But 
 now Henry, grown more callous as time elapsed, coined a new 
 scheme, vile as his own soul : he resolved, by acting on her 
 woman's fears, tenderness, and weakness, to make her the 
 instrument of persuading her lord to some damning confession, 
 that must stamp him as a deceiver for ever. This bright project 
 animated him to fresh endeavours to please, and her with fresh 
 hopes ; yet he paused a little before he sought to execute it. 
 
 Winter crept on into spring, and spring ripened into summer,

 and still the various actors in this tragic drama were spending 
 their lives, their every thought and heart's pulsation on one 
 object. Richard had latterly received intimation that he would 
 be permitted an interview with his beloved White Eose ; and a 
 week or two more were patiently endured with this expectation. 
 Katherine each day believed, that en the morrow she should see 
 him, whom now she conversed with only in her nightly dreams, 
 and woke each morning to find him fled with them. Some 
 change approached : Henry's promises became more clear in 
 their expression ; his assertions more pereniptory : he would at 
 last name his conditions, which she was to communicate to her 
 lord ; even Elizabeth almost dared to hope. Monina alone, 
 deeply impressed with a belief in the malice of Tudor, was 
 incredulous, and reluctantly yielded to Katherine's request to 
 suspend yet a little while her plots. 
 
 Whitsuntide arrived, and Henry at last would decide. This 
 estival was to be spent at Shene : thither the royal family went, 
 accompanied by the princess, who vanquished her disappoint- 
 ment at further delay, not to appear an ingrate to the fair- 
 promising king. Indeed, in the secure hope she cherished of 
 again seeing him who was her earthly paradise, she smiled 
 through the very heart-gushing tears expectation caused to flow. 
 On Whit Sunday she awoke, resolving to discard the heavy 
 load of anticipated evil that involuntarily weighed at her heart. 
 She knelt at mass, and fervently strove to resign her dearest 
 wishes to the direction of her God ; and yet that she should see 
 him again soon — oh ! how very soon, — filled her with such dizzy 
 rapture, that her orisons were forgot midway — remembered, and 
 turned to thanksgivings — till she recollected that still her hope 
 was unfulfilled ; and fear awoke, and with tears and prayer she 
 again strove to ease her agitated heart. 
 
 That very night a thunder-storm roused her from slumber : 
 with those unexplained emotions, which, in fateful periods, make 
 so large a portion of our lives, she felt as if every clap spoke 
 audibly some annunciation which she could not interpret : as if 
 every lurid flash were sent to disclose a sight which yet she 
 could not see. At length the rain ceased, the thunder grew 
 distant, the lightning faint ; a load was lifted from her soul ; she 
 slept, with the firm belief that on the morrow tidings, not all 
 evil, would be brought from London. 
 
 Some tidings surely came. What they were she was not per- 
 mitted to know. For the first time Henry made her a real 
 priponer ; she was carefully guarded, and none were allowed to 
 spi uk to her. Overwrought by her expectations, this seemed a 
 frightful cruelty ; and yet, where caution was used, there must

 be fear : lier — hiS enemy feared — then good had occuiTed. She 
 dared not permit her imagination to picture forth the thing 
 which yet was for ever present to it ; and, while all else were 
 amazed to hear that York had escaped and fled, his lovely, 
 anxious wife, cut off from communication with all, knew only 
 that she alone was ignorant of what she would have given her 
 life to learn.

 DuEiNG the winter and the untoward late spring, Eichard had 
 endured his captivity. The warm happy summer season, calling 
 all nature to a jubilee, at first saddened, then animated him to 
 contrive new projects of escape. The promised interview with 
 his White Eose tempted him to delay ; while an inner spirit 
 rebelled even against thjs dear enticement, and bade him fly. 
 
 On the evening of the ninth of June, he was permitted to 
 attend vespers in a secluded chapel of Westminster Abbey. 
 During the short passage from the palace to the cathedral, it 
 seemed to him as if a new life were awake everywhere ; an 
 unknown power, on the eve of liberating him. Never before 
 had he prayed so fervently for freedom : the pealing organ, the 
 dim arched venerable vault above, acted as stimulants to his 
 roused and eager soul ; he stood tiptoe, as on the eve of the 
 accomplishment of his desire. 
 
 A deep and awful sound suddenly shook the building ; a 
 glaring, lurid flash, filled with strange brilliancy the long, dark 
 aisle. A clap of thunder, loud, and swiftly repeated, rever- 
 berated along the heavens ; the shrill scream of women answered 
 the mighty voice. The priest who read the service, saw his 
 sacred book glared on by so keen a flash, as blinded him to the 
 dimmer light that succeeded. Every being in the church sank 
 on their knees, crossing themselves, and striving to repeat their

 Paternosters and Aves; vrliile Eicliard stood fearless, enjoying the 
 elemental roar, exulting in the peal, the flash, the tempestuous 
 havoek, as powers yet rebellious to his conqueror. Freedom 
 was victorious in the skyey plains ; there was freedom in the 
 careering clouds, freedom in the sheeted lightning, freedom in 
 the cataract of sound that tore its way along. On his poor 
 heart, sick of captivity, and enforced obedience, the sweet word 
 liberty hung as a spell : every bird and tiny fly he had envied as 
 being free ; how much more thino^s more powerful, the chainless 
 destructions of nature. The voice of God speaking in his own 
 consecrated abode was terrible to all ; soothing to himself alone. 
 He walked to the southern entrance of the edifice to mark the 
 splashing shower, as it ploughed the stones : two of his keepers 
 remained on their knees, paralyzed by terror ; the two others 
 followed trembling. At that moment a louder, a far, far louder 
 clap burst right above them, succeeding so instantaneously the 
 blinding flash, that, while every object was wrapped inflame, the 
 pavement and fretted roof of the abbey shook with the sound. 
 A bolt had fallen ; the priest at the altar was struck ; with 
 mingled horror and curiosity one of York's remaining guards 
 rushed towards the spot ; the only remaining one was kneeling 
 in an agony of terror. York stood on the threshold of the 
 porch ; he advanced a few steps beyond ; a new fear possessed 
 the fellow. " He will escape !— halloo !— James !— Martin ! " 
 The very words imparted the thought to the prince, who filled 
 erewhile with wonder and religious awe, had forgotten his own 
 sad plight. He turned to the man, who was doubtful whether to 
 rush into the chapel for his comrades, or singly to seize his 
 prisoner — his dagger was drawn. " Put up that foolish steel," 
 said York, " it cannot harm one whom God calls to freedom- 
 listen, He speaks ;— farewell ! " The lightning again flashed ; 
 with blue and forked flame it ran along the blade of the Aveapon 
 raised against him ; with a shriek the man dashed it to the 
 earth. Eichard was already out of sight. 
 
 The rain poured in torrents : it came down in continuous 
 cataracts from the eaves of the houses. On this sunny festival 
 few ha^d remained at home ; and those, terror-stricken now, were 
 on their knees ; no creature was in tlie streets as the fugitive 
 sped on, ignorant whither he should go. London was a vast, 
 imknown labyrinth to him : as well as he could divine, he directed 
 his flight eastward, and that with such velocity, that he might 
 compete with a horse in full career. If any saw him, as thus 
 with winged heels he flew along, they did not wonder that a 
 person should hasten to shelter out of the storm. It was of 
 slight regard to him that rain and hail ploughed the earth, and

 continued thunder echoed through the sky ; that alone and 
 friendless he fled through the streets of his victor's chief city. 
 His exulting heart, his light, glad spirit told him that he was 
 free ; if for a few minutes only, he would joyfully purchase with 
 his life those few minutes' emancipation from his frightful 
 thraldom. No words could speak, no thought image the supreme 
 gladness of that moment. 
 
 Meanwhile, dark night, aided by the thick clouds which still 
 poured down torrents of rain, had crept over the dim twilight, 
 and began to imbarrier with doubt the path of the rejoicing 
 fugitive. He found at last that the lines of houses receded, and 
 that he was in an open space, in the midst of which rose a 
 gigantic shadow, stretching itself in stillness and vastness on the 
 summit of the rising ground before him ; — it was the cathedral 
 of St, Paul's. Now, cloaked by the dark and inclement night, 
 he began to reflect on his actual situation : London might swarm 
 with his partizans, but he knew not where to find one. Proba- 
 bly all those who were occupied by his fate resided in West- 
 minster, whence he had precipitately fled ; whither assuredly he 
 would not return. These reflections perplexed him, but in no 
 way allayed his transport at finding himself free ; he felt that if 
 he wandered to the wide fields, and died of hunger there, it were 
 bliss enough to see the sky "unclouded by his dungeon roof; " 
 to behold the woods, the flowers, and the dancing waves ; nor 
 be mocked with man's shape, when those who wore it had sold 
 man's dearest privilege — that of allowing his actions to wait 
 upon the free impulses of his heart. 
 
 Still, therefore, he hurried along, and finally became com- 
 pletely bewildered in some swampy, low fields, intersected by 
 wide ditches. The night was pitchy dark ; nor was there any 
 clue afforded him by which he could even guess whether he 
 might not be returning on his path. Suddenly a small ray of 
 light threaded the gloom ; it went and came, and at last remained 
 stationary. With wavering will and irregular steps the prince 
 proceeded towards it ; for he would rather have died where he 
 stood, than discover himself, so to fall again into captivity. Once 
 or twice he lost sight of this tiny earth-star, which evidently 
 shone through some low casement ; and, as at last he caught 
 sight of the solitary miserable hut where it was sphered, the 
 recollection of his former asylum, of ill-fated Jane Shore's penu- 
 rious dwelling, flashed across him : with speedy, reassured 
 pace he hurried on, leaping a ditch that obstructed his path, 
 careless of every physical obstacle, when the malice of man 
 was no longer to be apprehended. " Poor Jane ! " he ejacu- 
 lated : and again he reflected with some wonder that, in every

 adversity, Avomen had been his resource and support; their 
 energies, their undying devotion and enthusiasm, were the 
 armour and weapons with which he had defended himself from 
 and attacked fortune. Even one so fallen and so low as poor 
 Jane Shore, was, through the might of fidelity and affection, of 
 more avail than all his doughty partizans, who, in the hour of 
 need, were scattered and forgetful. 
 
 The low-roofed cot was before him unmistaken. The crevice 
 whence the light emanated was too small to admit his inquiring 
 glance ; amid the driving, pattering rain he fancied that he dis- 
 tinguished voices within ; but, with a boldness which bade him 
 fear nothing, he lifted the latch, and beheld in truth a sight of 
 wonder ; — Monina, with a shriek started from her seat ; she 
 folded him with wild joy in her fair arms, and then, blushing 
 and trembling, threw herself on the neck of Lady Brampton ; 
 and Jane herself rose from her couch of straw, more wan, more 
 emaciated than ever ; — yet even over her sad pale face a smile 
 wandered, showing in yet more ghastly hues the ruin it 
 illumined. 
 
 Questions, ejaculations, wonder and delight, burst from every 
 lip : " He is here to our wish ; the means of escape are secured, 
 and he is here ! Oh, dearest Lady Brampton, do not the blessed 
 angels guard him ? " Monina spoke, and her soft luminous eyes 
 were fixed on him, as if not daring to believe the vision ; it was 
 not the chastened delight of age, but the burning, ardent joy of 
 a young heart, who had but one thought, one desire, and that 
 about to be accomplished ; her flushed cheeks betokened her 
 rapture : " I have repined, despaired, almost blasphemed ; yet 
 he is here : how good is Almighty God ! Listen, dear my lord, 
 how wondrously opportune your arrival is : Lady Brampton will 
 tell you all. Oh, this new miracle is the blessed Virgin's own 
 achievement — you are free ! " 
 
 Scarcely less animated, the zealous lady detailed the circum- 
 stances that united so favourably for him. She had been for 
 some time at Brussels with the Duchess Margaret, who was 
 more grieved than could be imagined at the capture of her 
 beloved nephew. She lived in a state of terror on his account. 
 That his life was awhile spared, availed little to pacify her ; the 
 midnight murders and prison-assassinations, so rife during the 
 wars of York and Lancaster were present to her imagination. 
 She exhausted every device, every bribe, to gain partizans for 
 him to achieve his freedom. Among others, most liberal of pro- 
 mises, was the false Clifford. After Eichard liad escaped from 
 him in the New Forest, he fell in with Frion, whose double plot 
 being defeated, he strove to capture and accuse the accomplice

AN ESCAPE. 361 
 
 whom, in fact, lie had deceived. The knight fled ; he escaped 
 to the Low Countries ; and by a glozing tale easily gained the 
 ear of the duchess. Lost in England, perhaps he wished to 
 rebuild his fallen fortunes ; aided by her munificence, perhaps 
 he prepared some new treachery ; however it might be, he was 
 trusted, and was the soul of the present enterprise. De Faro's 
 vessel, refitted and well manned, was now anchored in the mouth 
 of the Thames. Clifford undertook the task of foisting some 
 creature of his own, or even himself, disguised, of undertaking 
 the part of one of Eichard's keepers, when he doubted not to be 
 able to secure his flight. 
 
 With her usual vivacity Lady Brampton gave this account ; 
 but no explanations on her part could dissipate the horror York 
 felt at the name of Clifford, or inspire him with anything but 
 distrust of his intentions. Monina, before silenced by her san- 
 guine associates, now gave expression to the terror and abhor- 
 rence his interference occasioned ; she had come, exposing 
 herself to a thousand perils and pains, merely that she might 
 watch over his acts, and awaken her too credulous friends to a 
 knowledge of his duplicity. But the danger was past; before 
 Clifford could know that he had escaped, York might reach 
 the Adalid. 
 
 Almost as an answering echo to these words there was a sound 
 of hurrying steps. " It is he : the traitor comes. Oh, bar the 
 door! " There was no bar, no mode of securing this dwelling 
 of penury ; three women alone were his guard : Monina, pale 
 and trembling ; Lady Brampton, endeavouring to reassure her ; 
 while E-ichard stood forward, his gaze fixed on the opening door, 
 whose latch was already touched, resolved to meet, with perfect 
 show of frank reliance and intrepidity, the intruders. 
 
 Sir Robert Clifford entered. Confusion, attempted boldness, 
 and, last, sullen malice painted his aspect when he beheld the 
 prince. He was much changed, and looked almost an old man ; 
 his dark and profuse hair was grizzled ; his grey eyes hollow : 
 and his dress, though that of a cavalier, exhibited signs of 
 habitual neglect. His person, always slight, had been redeemed 
 from insignificance by its exquisite grace and elegance ; every 
 trace of this was flown ; and his haggard countenance and dimi- 
 nutive size made even York scarcely credit that this was indeed 
 the gay, reckless Eobin. His resolve had been already made ; 
 he addressed him kindly, saying, " Sir Robert, I hear that you 
 are willing to renew to me your broken vows : may you here- 
 after keep them more faithfully." 
 
 Clifford muttered a few words ; he looked towards the door, 
 as if desirous of escape j he struggled with shame, guilt, and

 some other emotion. As soon as a consultation began as to the 
 means to be adopted for the prince to reach the sea in safety, he 
 conquered himself, enterinj; into it with spirit and zeal. The 
 plan he proposed was crafty, his own part in it the principal. 
 He spoke of disguising^ the prince as a female attendant on 
 Monina ; of his and O'Water's accompanying them along the 
 river banks as soon as daylight. 
 
 " And wherefore not now ? Or rather, wherefore even now 
 do we not hasten to the Thames, and seize a boat? " 
 
 " Because," said Clifford, interrupting Monina, *' his hishness's 
 flight is already known ; a line of boats intersects the Thames 
 below London Bridge ; and lower still every craft is on the 
 alert." 
 
 Each one exchanged looks ; the knight continued : *' You all 
 distrust me, and I wonder not. I am in your power now ; here 
 are my unarmed hands ; even a woman may bind them. Go 
 forth yourselves : seek the path to the sea : before an hour 
 elapses the duke will be again a prisoner. You may in this wild 
 spot plant your daggers in my heart to avenge, but that will not 
 save him ; for I have no power here. But set me free, confide 
 to my care, and, by the God that made me, he walks the deck of 
 the Adalid ere the setting sun. I could tell you how this can 
 be, and ye would not the more trust me, if I spoke of such alli- 
 ance with, such power over, the rogues and vagabonds of this 
 saintly city, as enables me to move strange engines to execute 
 my will ; even if you credited me you would disdain that your 
 hero should owe his life to such base means. Be it as you will : 
 believe me ; and I pledge my life that his grace will ride the 
 dancing waves beyond King Henry's reach to-morrow night." 
 
 *' I accept the pledge," replied York, who had eyed him ear- 
 nestly as he spoke. " I commit myself to your care ; act 
 speedily, without fear of balk or suspicion on my part." 
 
 Clifford's lips curled into a triumphant smile ; because again 
 he was trusted, or because again he would betray, it was hard to 
 divine. " I must beseech your patience in the first place," said 
 Sir Robert : ** I cannot get the fitting disguises during the 
 night." 
 
 " Night is no more," replied Eichard, throwing open the case- 
 ment ; and the dusky room was illuminated by the day. In the 
 east there was a very fountain of light, which, welling up, 
 flooded the flecked and broken clouds with rosy hues : the stars 
 were gone ; a soft azure peeped between the breaking vapours ; 
 the morning air was deliciously fresh ; the birds chirped ; a dis- 
 tant watch-dog barked. Otherwise all was silent j and security 
 seemed to walk the earth.

AN ESCAPE. 363 
 
 " I will go seek the needful dresses," said Clifford. " Your 
 Grace will await my return, even though my stay, lengthened 
 beyond my expectation, give some reason for the distrust I read 
 n every eye." 
 
 " It is but too natural," said the prince, '* that my kind 
 friends should suspect you ; for myself, I have said the word ; 
 I place myself in your hands : half measures were of no avaiL 
 If indeed you are a traitor, bring Tudor's hirelings here to seize 
 their prey. I cannot fear ; I will not doubt ; and, if in my 
 soul any suspicion lurk, my actions shall not be guided by it. 
 Go ; let your return be speedy or otherwise, I await you here." 
 
 Scarcely had the door closed, when Monina, whose eyes had 
 been fixed on Clifford's countenance during the whole scene, 
 exclaimed : — " This moment is our own ! Fly, my prince ; 
 trust me — I know that bad man ; if he find you here when he 
 returns, you are lost." 
 
 " Hist ! " Jane spoke the word, and a dead silence fell upon 
 the anxious band. The steps of a horse were heard : Monina 
 flew to the casement. " It is our faithful Irish friend, my lord ; it 
 is O'Water." The door was opened ; and each one crowded 
 round the visitant. He uttered a "By the mischief !" which 
 sounded like a benediction, when he saw the duke of York, 
 adding, " All is well, all in readiness ; I left the Adalid, after 
 the storm yester evening, in safe anchorage." 
 
 " Oh yes, safety," cried the enthusiastic Spaniard ; " safety oi^ 
 death ! Trust not false Clifford — seize the fleeting, precious 
 opportunity, — O' Water's horse " 
 
 " Is blown," said Richard ; " he cannot carry me." 
 
 " And the ways strangely beset," said the mayor. " Just 
 now I saw a young gentleman seized, much to his annoyance, 
 by some patrol. He bribed dearly, but they would not listen — ' 
 the whole country is alarmed." 
 
 " I will wait for Clifford," continued York ; " and trust in 
 Providence. Some kind friend only bestow a dagger on me : I 
 would not be taken like an unarmed girl." 
 
 " A tramp of steeds — they are coming, Clifford guides them 
 hither ; we are lost !" cried Lady Brampton. 
 
 " Oh, fly — fly — my liege," said O'Water, " expose not these 
 women to the assault. Poor Eose Blanche can yet bear you 
 fast and far." 
 
 The sound as of a troop of horse neared. The prince saw 
 O'Water blocking up the casement, and then draw his sword. 
 Monina, wild with agony, fell at his feet : — " Fly, my lord, fly 
 for the Lady Xatherine's sake : fly for mine own : must I see 
 you die ? X who have lived — alas ! how vainly. Lady Bramp-

 ton — beseecli — command — he must flj. O, they will be here- 
 to seize, to murder him ! " 
 
 " Here is my dagger, my lord," said O'Water, coolly ! — 
 *' Defend yourself — meanwhile — now at our last hour — for surely 
 it is come, Our Lady recommend us to God's holy grace." 
 
 The gallop of a troop grew yet more distinct ; Richard looked 
 round : Jane was kneeling, her face buried in her hands : 
 Lady Brampton pale, but resolved, was ready to sacrifice the 
 life she had spent for him. O'Water had resigned himself to 
 the final act of a life of peril, sealed in his blood. The lovely 
 Spaniard alone lost all her self-possession ; tears streaming 
 from her uplifted eyes ; her arms twined round his knees : to 
 fly — fly ! was the only thought she could express. " I yield," 
 said York ; " throw open the door." O'Water's horse had been 
 led within the hut ; he vaulted on his back ; he placed tlie 
 dagger in his belt. " That way," Lady Brampton cried, *' it 
 leads to the river's side below." 
 
 A scream from Monina followed his swift departure. " He 
 perishes — he betrays us !" cried O'Water. E-ichard galloped on 
 not across the field away from town, but right into danger ; 
 there, whence the troop was certainly approaching. He was 
 lost to view on the instant, in a straggling lane which stretched 
 out half across the field. A moment after coming from the 
 other side, unobserved till in the hut, Clifibrd entered alone. 
 He bore a large bundle ; his steps were cautious and swift ; his 
 look told that he was intent only on the object of his errand. 
 " I have succeeded beyond my hope. My life on it all is safe. 
 Where have ye hid the prince? Oh, prithee, fear not, nor 
 trifle : each second is precious." 
 
 The confused wondering looks of all present replied to him. 
 Cliflbrd laughed, a short, sarcastic, bitter laugh : and then, 
 with a fiendUke expression of face, he said, " The prince has 
 done well ; and ye have all done well : and his Grace will thank- 
 you anon. Ye grudge me, maybe, the Duchess Margaret's 
 bounty. She promised largely ; 'twere pity to share the boon 
 among so many. Now mark the event ! " 
 
 These words displayed the baseness of his motive, yet 
 vouched for his sincerity. He threw a menacing glance around, 
 and then quitted the hut; and with hurried pace hastened 
 across the field towards the town.

 Full many a glorious morning: have I seen,

 Anon, permit the basest clouds to ride 
 With ugly rack on his celestisd face. 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 The duke of York, ur^ed so earnestly to fly, felt that to do 
 so ■was to save himself at the expense of his friends, on Trhom 
 Henry's vengeance would severely fall, when he found himself 
 balked of his victim. He consented to leave Jane Shore's 
 abode, with the resolve not of effectino^ his escape, but of 
 securinf^, by surrendering himself, the safety of his defenceless 
 adherents united under her lowly roof. He directed his course 
 as he believed into the very centre of danger, entering the 
 narrow straggling street whence the sound of the advance of 
 the troop of horse had been heard. He entered the lane ; it 
 was empty. The ominous sounds were still sharp and near ; it 
 seemed as if they were in some street parallel to the one which 
 he threaded. He turned at right angles into another, to reach 
 the spot : again he turned, led by the baffling noise, in another 
 direction. It was just four in the morning ; there were but 
 few abroad so early : he saw a monk gliding stealthily from 
 nnSer a dark archway, and a poor fellow, who looked as if he 
 had slept beneath heaven's roof, and had not wherewithal to 
 break his fast. True to the kindly instincts of his nature, 
 Eichard felt at his girdle for his purse ; it was long since he had 
 possessed the smallest coin of his adversary's realm. " I, a 
 prince ! " his feeling had been more bitter, but that his fingers 
 came in contact with his dagger's hilt, and the conviction of 
 freedom burst with fresh delight upon him. Free, even in 
 spite of its intents ; for the tramp which had gradually grown 
 fainter, was dying absolutely away. 
 
 They had probably reached the hut : thither he must return. 
 It was no easy thing to find his way to it, he had so entangled

 himself in the narrow lanes, and wretched assemblages of 
 dwellings huddled together on the outskirts of London. At 
 length they opened before him : there was the dingy field, there 
 the hut, standing in quiet beneath the rays of the morning sun, 
 of the opening, summer, soft, sweet day. He was quickly at 
 its threshold ; he entered. Jane was within, alone, seated in 
 her wooden chair ; her hands clasped ; her pale face sunk on 
 her bosom : big tears were gathering in her eyes, and rolling 
 down her faded cheeks unheeded. Jane's aspect was usually so 
 marble (a miraculous chiselling of resigned hopelessness), her 
 mien so unbending, that these signs of emotion struck the prince 
 with wonder and compassion. 
 
 He knelt at her feet and pressed her thin, but little hand to 
 his lips, saying, "Mother, where are my friends? Mother, 
 bless me before I go." ' 
 
 She dried the drops raining from her eyes, saying in a voice 
 that expressed how occupied she was by her own emotion, " I 
 am a sinful woman ; well do these tones remind me of the same : 
 those days are quite, quite gone, even from the memory of all ; 
 but once they were as the present hour, when so he spoke, and 
 I was lost, and still am lost ; for, through hunger and cold and 
 shame, I love, and cannot quite repent. Will the hour ever 
 pome when I can regret that once I was happy ? " 
 
 Many, many sad years had passed since words like these had 
 dropped from poor Jane's lips ; her feelings fed on her, possessed 
 Jier, but she had been mute ; overflowing now, her accent was 
 calm ; she spoke as if she was unaware that her thoughts framed 
 speech, and that she had an auditor. 
 
 " You have paid a dear penalty, and are surely forgiven," 
 said York, striving in his compassion to find the words that 
 might be balm to her. 
 
 " Prince," she continued, " some time ago, — I have lost all 
 date ; now the chasm seems nought, now a long eternity ; it was 
 when my poor heart knew nothing of love, save its str^g 
 necessity and its delight ; methought I would see your father's 
 fair offspring, for I loved them for his sake. At the festival of 
 Easter I placed myself near the gate of the royal chapel : I 
 thought to be unseen. The happy queen held her sons each by 
 the hand ; you were then, as now, his image, a little sportive 
 blue-eyed cherub. The prince of Wales had his mother's look : 
 her large, dark eye, her soft, rosy mouth, her queenlike brow ; 
 her beauty which had won Edward, her chaste sweetness, which 
 had made her his wife ; my presence — I thought to conceal it 
 better — was revealed. The queen turned her face away ; there 
 was anguish surely written there, for the prince darted on me

TEEASON. 367 
 
 a look of such witlierino^ scorn — yes, even he — his stainless, fair 
 brow was knit, his bright angel's face clouded : the look sank in 
 my heart. Edward's beautiful, pure child reproved me, hated 
 me : for three days I felt that 1 would never see the deluder 
 more : you do not share his abhorrence ; you do not hate the 
 pale ghost of Shore's wife ?" 
 
 Such clinging to the past, such living memory of what was so 
 absolutely dead to all except herself, awe-struck the prince : 
 " We are all sinners in the eye of God," he said, " but thy 
 faults are surely forgiven thee, gentle one : thy tears have 
 washed every trace away, and my brother, my poor murdered 
 Edward, now blesses thee. Alas ! would that I could soften 
 this last stage of your suffering earthly life." 
 
 " 'Tis better as it is," she answered hastily, " once I felt dis- 
 grace and privation keenly ; perhaps that may atone. Now, 
 would it were more bitter, that so I might wean myself from 
 him whose very memory will lose my soul. You are good, and 
 Our Lady will requite you. Now, listen : the damsel Monina 
 and Master O'Water have gone towards Southend : your re- 
 maining friends watch for you here. I shall see them again to- 
 night : meanwhile it is to be feared that Clifford plots vengeance, 
 and you must fly ; you must at every hazard go towards South- 
 end. Beyond the town, on the lone sands, there is a wooden 
 cross, telling where one escaped dreadful peril through the 
 might of Him who died on it for us ; the smallest sign, the 
 waving of your cap, will be watched for by the Adalid, they will 
 send a boat to take you on board. Now swiftly depart : your 
 life hangs on the hour ; this purse will furnish you with means 
 Lady Brampton left it for you." 
 
 " Bless me, mother, ere I go." 
 
 " Can a sinner's blessing avail ? fear rather that God punish 
 me through you, where my heart is garnered. Oh, may He 
 indeed bless and save you ; and I shall die in peace." 
 
 He kissed her withered hand and was gone ; she dragged her 
 failing limbs to the casement ; he was already lost among the 
 straggling tenements that bounded her field. 
 
 Again York was flying from his foe ; again studying to elude 
 pursuit, with how different feelings. Before, his flight was 
 peremptory, for the preservation of others, while he blindly 
 longed to deliver himself to slavery. Now liberty, for its own 
 dear sake, was worth the world to him. He had tasted to its 
 dregs the misery of captivity, and loathed the very name; 
 whatever might betide, he would never submit willingly again to 
 one hour's thraldom. He felt his dagger's hilt ; he drew it from 
 the sheath, and eyed its polished blade with gladness j for eight

 months lie had been living unarmed, under the perpetual keep- 
 ing of armed jailors ; what wonder that he looked on this sharp 
 steel as the key to set him free from every ill. 
 
 He got clear of the town : the open sky, the expanse of 
 summer — adorned earth was before him. It was the "leafy 
 month of June ;" the far-spread corn-fields were getting yellow; 
 and on their weltering surface played the shadows of a few 
 clouds, relics of the last night's storm : the sun was bright, the 
 breeze balmy, already the very foot-paths were dry, and scarcely 
 from its inmost leaves did any tree shake moisture : yet there 
 was a freshness in the scene, a lightness in the air, the gift of 
 tempest. The dazzling sun rose higher, and each island-vapour 
 sank on the horizon ; the garish light clothed all things ; the 
 lazy shadows crept up around the objects which occasioned 
 them, while both object and its shade seemed to bask in the 
 sunshine. Now overhead the meeting boughs of trees scarce 
 sufficed to shield him from the penetrating glare ; now in the 
 open path he was wholly exposed to it, as his diminished 
 shadow clung almost to the horse's hoofs. The birds twittered 
 above ; the lazy mare was stretched basking, while her colt 
 gambolled around ; each slight thing spoke of the voluptuous 
 indolence of summer, and the wafted scent of hay, or gummy 
 exhalation of evergrcens, distilled by the warm noon, fed with 
 languid sweets every delighted sense. If paradise be ever of 
 this world it now embowered Richard. All was yet insecure ; 
 his White Hose was far : but nature showered such ecstasy on 
 him that his whole being was given up to her influence. Latterly 
 tlie form of man had been ever before his aching sight under the 
 aspect of an enemy ; the absence of every fellow-creature he 
 hailed with gladness — free and alone, alone and free ! With the 
 pertinacious dwelling on one idea, which is characteristic of 
 overpowering feeling, this combination of words and ideas 
 haunted his thoughts, fell from his lips, and made a part of the 
 soul-subduing rapture now his portion. 
 
 May it be added — we must address the unhappy and imagina- 
 tive, who know that the future is so linked with the present as 
 to have an influence over that present, when we add — that the 
 intensity of the liberated prince's feelings was wrought even to 
 pain, by its being the last time that unalloyed delight would 
 ever be his — the last when he might feel himself the nursling of 
 nature, allied by the bond of enjoyment to all her offspring. He 
 knew not this himself. Immersed in the sense of all that ho 
 now possessed, he did not pause to reflect whether this were the 
 last time, that he, the victim of chance and change, might ever 
 see the waving corn or shadowy trees, or hear the carolling

 birds, or the murmurs of tlie fresh free brooks gur^^ling round 
 some pendant bough or jutting stone ; but that so it was to 
 be, gave poignancy to his pleasure, a dreamy halo to the whole 
 scene. 
 
 It would appear, in spite of the precautions taken by his 
 enemy, that the north bank of the Thames had been neglected. 
 Sichard met with no impediment in his progress. Whenever 
 he caught a sight of the river, he perceived unusual signs of 
 activity. Little wherries shot hither and thither on its surface, 
 revealing to him that keen and vigilant search was being made. 
 Meanwhile he rode on, the broad stream for his guide, avoiding 
 towns and villages. He ventured to purchase bread at a lone 
 farmhouse — he alighted in a little grove beside a rivulet, to rest 
 his tired horse, and to refresh himself. The summer heat re- 
 called Andalusia to his mind; and scenes and objects, quite 
 forgotten, wandered from their oblivious recesses back into his 
 recollection. " My happy boyhood ! My beloved Spain ! Why 
 
 did I leave the land of beauty, where with Monina ?" The 
 
 idea of her whose fate was so inextricably linked with his, of his 
 bride, who had quitted her palace home to share his adversity, 
 reproached him. But his imagination could not fix itself on 
 bleak Scotland, its wild haunts, its capricious king : it could 
 only build another bower among the folds of the mountains of 
 Andalusia, and place his White Rose therein. 
 
 Again he pursued his way. The slant beams of the descend- 
 ing sun were yet more sultry, but it sank swiftly down ; now 
 casting gigantic shadows, bathing the tree-tops in golden dew, 
 and flooding the clouds with splendour ; now it was gone, and 
 the landscape faded into a brown mellow tint. The birds' last 
 chirp was given, the beetle winged her noisy flight, the congre- 
 gated rooks had flown to the belfry of the church, or to their 
 nests in the churchyard trees ; silence and twilight crept up 
 from the sedgy banks of the river, leaving the pale water alone 
 to reflect the struggling farewell of day. In a little time the 
 banks shelved away, giving place to broad yellow sand. Richard 
 ventured to bend his course alon^ the beach. There was a bark 
 upon the dim tide, whose progress he had watched since noon, 
 whose flapping or full sails were the signs by which he foretold 
 the prosperity of his destined voyage. Now with swelling canvas 
 it walked swiftly over the water. 
 
 He passed Southend. He perceived the tall rough-hewn 
 cross. Two figures were seated at its foot. He hesitated, but 
 quickly perceiving that one was a woman, he proceeded onwards. 
 The stars were out ; the very west was dim ; in the offing there 
 was a vessel, whose build and tall slender masts he thought he

 recognized. The broad expanse of calm ocean was there, whose 
 waves broke in tiny ripplets on the beach. He reached the cross. 
 O'Water and Monina saw his approach. The Irishman wel- 
 comed him boisterously, in his own language. Monina uttered a 
 benediction in Spanish. The scene was solitary and secure. 
 Every danger was past. There floated the caravel which insured 
 escape, and the stars alone witnessed their flight. Monina gave 
 her white veil to O'Water, who contrived to elevate it on the 
 cross. In a few moments the splash of oars was heard, and a 
 dark speck floated towards them on the waves, from the direc- 
 tion of the Adalid. " They come ; you are safe," murmured 
 his lovely friend ; *' this hour repays for all." The boat was 
 already on the beach : a seaman leaped on shore. " The White 
 English Hose," he said : such was the word agreed upon ; and, 
 hailing it, Monina hurried to embark with her companions. The 
 little boat was pushed from shore. O'Water gave vent to his 
 delight in a shout that resembled a yell. Monina crept close to 
 the duke of York : that he was safe was a truth so dear, so new, 
 that she forgot everything, save her wish to assure herself again 
 and again that so it was. At that moment of triumph, some- 
 thing like sadness invaded Eichard : he had quitted the land for 
 which his friends had bled, and he had suffered — for ever : he 
 had left his Katherine there, where all was arrayed against 
 him for his destruction. This was safety ; but it was the 
 overthrow of every childish dream, every youthful vision ; it 
 put the seal of ineffectual nothingness on his every manhood's 
 act. 
 
 While each, occupied by their peculiar reveries, were aware 
 only that they were being borne onwards on the waves, a smaller 
 boat shot athwart their bows, and a voice exclaimed in Spanish, ; 
 ** Desdichados, estais alia ? " 
 
 "My father — we are betrayed," Monina cried: and she! 
 threw her arms round Hichard, as if by such frail guard to 
 shelter him — another stronger grasp was upon his arm as ho 
 endeavoured to rise — a voice, husky from passion, yet still j 
 Clifford's voice, muttered, " The day is mine — you — she — allj 
 are mine ! " 
 
 " Thou fell traitor ! What ho ! De Faro, to the rescue ! " 
 already the mariner had thrown a grappling iron — already the 
 Adalid was in motion towards them. Clifford strove to draw; 
 his sword. York was upon him in mortal struggle ; his keen 
 dagger, unsheathed, uplifted ; the boat lurched — his arm de- 
 scended, but half the force of the intended blow was lost, while 
 both fell overboard. The crew rushed to the boat's side to 
 loosen the grappling iron, which concluded its upset. De Faro,

 ^vllO stood liigli on the bows of Lis own boat, had seized Moniua. 
 Now another larger skiff was seen approaching, " To your oars ! " 
 cried the Moor : they shot swiftly towards the Adalid, and 
 vrhile the sea became alive with craft, they reached the little 
 caravel, who, turning her canvas to the wind, dropped down 
 the tide. ■

 DEATH OF CLIFFOKD. 
 
 Your love and pity doth the irapi'ession fill,

 On the fourth day of her restraint, imprisonment it could hardly 
 be called. Lady Katherine was brought up to Westminster ; she 
 was carried in a close litter, and no familiar face or accustomed 
 attendant came near. Her anxiety, her anguish weighed into- 
 lerably upon her — sleep had not visited her eyes ; she lived in 
 perpetual terror that each sound was freighted with fatal tidings. 
 It was in vain that even reason bade her nourish hope — a 
 stronger power than reason dwelt in her heart, turning all its 
 yearnings to despair. 
 
 As she approached the city, she thought each step must reveal 
 the truth of what she was to suffer. Lo ! the palace was entered 
 — her habitual chamber — silence and solitude alone manifested 
 that some change was even now in its effect ; she had no tear? 
 to spend upon her grief ; her changing colour, her quickened 
 respiration showed that every faculty was possessed by terror. 
 Two hours, each minute stretched to a long, long century, — two 
 hours passed, when a little scroll was delivered to her ; it came 
 from tlie queen, and contained these words, " My White Eosc ! 
 the tempest has past — leaving, alas! devastation: we yet 
 remain to each other — come " 
 
 These expressions spoke the worst to her fear-stricken mind 
 — no subsequent agony might ever compare to the pang that 
 made her very life-blood pause in her failing heart at that 
 moment. Had the present and the future become void for him, 
 to whom she was wedded heart and soul ? — wedded in youth,

 ■wlien our hopes stretcli themselves not merely to to-day and to- 
 morrow, but even to eternity. In this state of human woe, we do 
 not describe the disheartening and carking sorrows of those who 
 lag on life's highway — but the swift, poignant, intolerable ago- 
 ]iies of the young, to whom the aspiration for happiness is a 
 condition of being. The queen had been accustomed to witness 
 and admire Katherine's self-command and quiet fortitude ; she 
 was awe-struck on beholding the devastation of the last four 
 days, and the expression of wild horror on her soft features. 
 With feminine instinct she read her heart, her first words were, 
 " Sweet love, he lives — and he will live — his life is spared, and 
 we may still hope." 
 
 Tears at last flowed from the mourner's eyes, as she asked, 
 " What then will be his fate ? — Shall I ever see him more ? " 
 
 " How can we guess the hidden purposes of the king? By 
 your enforced solitude you have escaped his scowling brow, his 
 violence, his sarcasms ; again he smiles. My gentle Kate, my 
 sweet, courageous sufferer, hitherto we have played with the 
 lion's fangs — they are unsheathed in anger now — let us prepare : 
 he will be here anon." 
 
 The princess desired not to exhibit too humiliating a spectacle 
 of misery to her cruel foe — she checked her weeping — she en- 
 deavoured to forget the burning agony that tortured her beating 
 heart. " Let him but live ; let me but once more see him ;" and 
 the unbidden tears flowed again. The king soon broke in upon 
 them ; his look was haughty even to insolence : an expression 
 of vulgar triumph was in his eyes, that baffled the eay;er scan- 
 ning gaze of the hapless princess. He said, scofiingly (and was 
 it in man's nature, or only in Henry's, to look on the sad, but 
 lovely countenance of his victim, and to mock her woeF), "We 
 congratulate you, lady, on the return of the gentle Pcrkin to 
 our good city of Westminster — do not weep — he is in safe 
 keeping now, very safe — it is no feathered shoe our Mercury 
 wears this day." 
 
 " Holy Virgin ! " cried Katherine, " your grace does not 
 surely mean " 
 
 '• Fear not — he lives," continued Henry, his scorn growing 
 more bitter as he spoke ; " he lives, and shall live, till the AYhite 
 Eose acknowledge on what base stock she is grafted, or he 
 twist the rope by some new sleight. Is Perkin's honoured 
 dame satisfied? " 
 
 " Oh, no, no, no ; some covert meaning you have ; in pity for 
 a woman, speak." The agony her countenance expressed was 
 the mute echo of the frightful idea that convulsed her frame. 
 ** Oh, let me see him ! you have tormented me too cruelly ; even

 if my worst fears prove true, he suffers not more tlian I ; and can 
 it be tliat the young limbs of my own loved Eichard are put to 
 torture ! " 
 
 Elizabeth, grew ashy white ; the king listened with a sarcastic 
 smile, saying, " I had not thought of that ; you are a silly girl to 
 mention such things." 
 
 "I do not believe you," exclaimed the princess, "your looks 
 belie your words ; let me but see him afar off, let me catch a 
 glimpse of my princely love — is he in the Tower ? " 
 
 " Neither the Tower, nor any royal palace, detains your lord ; 
 he is taking the air, pleasantly I hope, in the high places of our 
 town. To finish this war of words, and your incredulity, will 
 you visit your prince of plotters, and behold him on whom tlie 
 king of Scotland bestowed your virgin hand ? " 
 
 " See him ! Oh, even in death to clasp his decaying limbs 
 were better than this absence ! " 
 
 An indefinable expression passed over Henry's countenance as 
 he replied, " Be it as you wish ; you must hasten, for in an hour 
 the occasion will be past ; it is but a few steps ; you shall be 
 attended." 
 
 At last she was to see him ; this assurance filled and satisfied 
 her ; there was no place in her heart for any other thought, 
 sinister as were her torturer's looks. Her eyes grew bright, her 
 cheek resumed its vermeil tint, never had she looked more 
 lovely ; it was a dazzling beauty ; one of those ineffable expres- 
 sions, which, unless language could express music, or painting 
 image fire, it is in "vain to attempt to describe : an irradiation of 
 love passed over her countenance ; her form ; something like it 
 dwells in E/aphael's Madonnas and Guido's Angel of Annuncia- 
 tion, — Henry was awestruck, yet did not falter in his purpose ; 
 he let the bright angel go forth on her mission of good and love, 
 to meet on her way a sight fiends might rejoice over. Human 
 life and human nature are, alas ! a dread, inexplicable web of 
 suffering and of infliction. 
 
 In Westminster, in sight of the abbey where his ancestors 
 had been crowned kings, the spectacle, intended to be so oppro- 
 brious, was set forth. Henry, in his angry fear on his escape, 
 in his exultation at his re-capture, forgot the soft tyranny of 
 Catherine's looks ; or rather he despised himself for the obedi- 
 ence he had yielded to them ; and, in the true spirit of baseness, 
 was glad to revenge on her the ill effects that had resulted to 
 him through his involuntary enslavement. It was a triumph to 
 him to disgrace the object of her care, for he was ill-read, his 
 understanding affording him no key to the unknown language, 
 in that illuminated page of the history of feminine excellence,

 yrhicli tells the deli^jlit she feels in exhausting her treasures ot 
 dcYoted love on the fallen, because they need it most : he believed, 
 that to present her husband to her, under the very infliction ot 
 iouoniiny, -would turn her affection to cold disdain — he permitted 
 her to go. Attended by some of the body-guard and a gentle- 
 man usher, she hastened through the courts of the palace into 
 the open square : there was assembled a crowd of common 
 people, hushed to universal silence : at a distance from the centre 
 some were talking aloud, and the name of " Perkin " was the 
 burthen of their speech ; but pity stilled those nearest to the 
 spot, towards which, to the surprise and horror of all, she 
 hastened. The crowd instinctively closed to bar her advance ; 
 and, when forced to make way, in spite of the despotism of the 
 times, the word '•' Shame " burst from the lips of many, especially 
 the women. She was agitated by the obstacles, by the numerous 
 UDCOurtly eyes turned on her ; still she went on, and soon saw — 
 
 She understood not what — a kind of wooden machine, in which 
 the lord of her heart sat. There had been a time when pride 
 and royal majesty of soul had shed such grandeur over York, 
 that, when exposed as a shoM', he had excited reverence, not 
 scoffing. Now he was evidently labouring under great physical 
 suffering; his brow was streaked with mortal paleness, his 
 cheeks were colourless ; his fair hair fell in disordered ringlets 
 round his youthful but wan countenance ; he leaned his head 
 against the side of the machine : his eyes were half shut ; it was 
 not shame, but suffering, that weighed upon their lids, and 
 diffused an air of languor and pain over his whole person. 
 Katherine hastened towards him, she knelt on the unworthy 
 earth at his side, she kissed his chained hands. " You are ill, 
 my love ; my ever dear Richard, what has happened ? for you are 
 very ill. 
 
 lioused by such music from the lethargy that oppressed him, 
 yet still overcome, he replied, " Yes ; and I do believe that all 
 ■\rt ill soon end, and that I am stricken to the death." 
 
 She grew pale ; she called him cruel ; asking him how he could 
 dream of leaving her, who was a part of him, alone in the deso- 
 late world. " Because," he answered with a faint smile, '* the 
 world is kind to all, save me. No taint, dear love, attaches 
 itself to your name ; no ill will mark your fate, when you are no 
 longer linked to such a thing as I. God has spoken, and told 
 me that this earth is no dwelling for one, who, from his cradle to 
 this last shame, has been fortune's step-child, and her despised 
 toy. How often have I been dragged to the utmost verge of 
 life : I have felt indignation, anger, despair ; now I am resigned ; 
 I feel the hand of the Mighty One on rae, and I bow to it. In

DEATH OF CLIFFORD. 375 
 
 very truth, I am subdued ; I sleep away the weary hours, and 
 death will end them all," 
 
 With every expression of tenderness, Katherine endeavoured 
 to recall him to life and to herself. She spoke of another escape, 
 which it would be her care to achieve, of the solitude, of the 
 paradise of love they would enjoy together. " My poor girl," 
 he replied, " teach your young heart to seek these blessings 
 apart from me ; I were the very wretch Tudor stigmatises me, 
 could I live under a memory like this. Forget me, my White 
 Eose ; paint with gaudier colours the sickly emblem of my 
 fortunes ; forget that, duped by some strange forgery, you were 
 wedded to — Perkin Warbeck." 
 
 In spite of himself, large drops gathered in his eyes, swelling 
 the downcast lids, and then stealing down. Catherine kissed 
 them from his cheek ; a thousand times more noble, royal, god- 
 like, she called him ; had not the best and worthiest suffered 
 ignominious punishment ; even our blessed Lord himself ? His 
 own acknowledgment alone could disgrace him ; he must recall 
 the false words wrung from his agony ; this last vile act of his 
 enemy must awaken each sovereign on his throne to indignation ; 
 each would see in him a mirror of what might befall themselves, 
 if fallen. James, her royal cousin, roused by her, should resent 
 the stigma affixed to his kinsman. 
 
 " For your own sake, sweet, do so ; my soul dying within me 
 is alive again with indignation, to think that your plighted 
 wedded love is he, who is exposed to contumely ; but for that, 
 methinks I would call myself by that wretched name I dared 
 pronounce, so that the annals of the House of York escaped this 
 stain : yet even thus I seem more closely allied to them ; for 
 violent death, treachery, and ill have waited on each descendant 
 of Mortimer ; my grandfather bore a paper crown in shame upon 
 his kingly brow." 
 
 He was interrupted by the officer, who unclosed the instru- 
 ment of disgrace. Eichard, ^eak and failing, was assisted to 
 rise ; Katherine supported him as a young mother her feeble 
 offspring ; she twined her arms round him as his prop, and, in 
 spite of misery, was enraptured once again to see, to hear, to 
 touch him from whom she had been absent so long. " This is 
 not well ; it must not be ; his majesty will be much displeased," 
 said the chief of the guard, witnessing the compassion her tender 
 care inspired. " You must return to the palace, lady." 
 
 " One little step," pleaded Katherine ; " if I should never see 
 him more, how should I curse your cruelty ! I will not speak, 
 as I half thought I would to these good people, to tell them that 
 they may well honour him a princess loves : drag me not away

376 DEATH OF CLIFFORD. 
 
 yet — one more good-bye ! — farewell, noble York, Kate's only 
 love ; — we meet again ; this parting is but mockery." 
 
 She wept on his bosom ; the sound of wailing arose in the 
 crowd ; the prince's eyes alone were dry ; he whispered comfort 
 to her ; he promised to live, to baffle his foe again for her sake ; 
 the words revived her, and she saw him depart with hope, with 
 new joy kindled in her bosom. 
 
 There had been another, the public gaze, till Katherine came 
 to draw all eyes to a newer wonder. An emaciated, pale woman, 
 in a garb of penury, who knelt, telling her beads, beside York's 
 prison ; her face was hid ; but her hands were thin and white to 
 ghastliness ; during the last scene she had sobbed to agony, and 
 now, as the place cleared, went her way silently, with slow, feeble 
 steps. Many marked her with surprise and curiosity ; few 
 knew that she was the Jane Shore, whose broken heart whis- 
 pered misery, as she thought that she beheld King Edward's 
 guilt, in which she had shared, visited on his son. This cruel 
 lesson of religion was a canker in her heart, and most true it 
 was, as far as regarded her royal lover, that his light loves, and 
 careless playing with sacred ties, had caused the blot of base 
 birth to be aiSxed to his legitimate offspring, and so strewed the 
 sad way that led them to untimely death. 
 
 Henry, cruel as he was, had not the courage to encounter his 
 insulted prisoner on her return. Katherine's feelings were 
 wrought too high for any display of passion ; her anxiety was 
 spent on how she could sooth York's wounded feelings, and 
 restore his health : it were vain to ask, she feared ; yet, if the 
 king would permit her to attend on him, under whatever restric- 
 tions, they should be obeyed ; and this while poor Elizabeth 
 besought her pardon with tears, for being the wife of her inso- 
 lent adversary. She, a proud Plantagenet, was more sorely 
 stung than the White Eose, by the indignity offered to her 
 house ; and she entreated her not to love her brother less because 
 of this foul disgrace. " So doing," said the quick-sighted queen, 
 "you fulfil his dearest wish. While you are Richard's loving 
 wife, he, even he, the fallen and humiliated, is an object of envy 
 to his majesty, who sought, by making you witness his ignominy, 
 to detach you from him." 
 
 " How strange a mistake," replied Katherine, " for one so sage 
 as the king : the lower my sweet Richard falls, the more need 
 he surely has of me. But that love, such as ours, knits us too 
 indivisibly to admit a reciprocity of benefit, I should say that it 
 is to make me rich indeed, to enable me to bestow, to lavish good 
 on my lord ; but we are one, and I but give to mj'self, and 
 myself receive, if my weakness is of any strength to him. Dear

DEATH OP CLIFFOED. 377 
 
 sister mine, your liege, wise as he may be, is a tyro in our 
 woman's lore — in the mysteries of devoted love ; he never felt 
 one inspiration of the mighty sprite." 
 
 This was not quite true. For some few days Henry had been 
 so inspired ; but love, an exotic in his heart, degenerated from 
 being a fair, fragrant flower, into a wild, poisonous weed. Love, 
 whose essence is the excess of sympathy, and consequently of 
 self-abandonment and generosity, when it alights on an unworthy 
 soil, appears there at first in all its native bloom, a very wonder 
 even to the heart in which it has taken root. The cold, selfish, 
 narrow-hearted Richmond was lulled to some slight forgetfulness 
 of self, when first he was fascinated by Katherine, and he decked 
 himself with ill-assorted virtues to merit her approbation. This 
 lasted but a brief interval ; the uncongenial clime in which the 
 new plant grew, impregnated it with its own poison. Envy, 
 arrogance, base desire to crush the fallen, were his natural pro- 
 pensities ; and, when love refused to minister to these, it changed 
 to something like hate in his bosom ; it excited his desire to have 
 power over her, if not for her good, then for her bane. 
 
 The duke of York was imprisoned in the Tower. ISo further 
 measures were apparently in action against him. Katherine no 
 longer hoped anything from her foe ; and day and night there 
 lay beneath her eyelids the image of Ilichard, wasting and dying 
 in captivity. Something must be done, some aid afforded him ; 
 she was anxious also to learn the details of his flight, and how 
 again he fell into the hands of his foe. Monina, who in a thou- 
 sand disguises had been used to penetrate everywhere, was seen 
 no more. Still public report informed her of many things. 
 
 It was known, that Sir Robert Clifford, the old spy and traitor 
 of the White Eose, had become fware of the measures taken by 
 York's adherents to insure his escape from England. He had 
 followed him down the river, and by a knowledge of the signs 
 and countersigns of the party, decoyed him into a boat that was 
 to convey his victim back to his prison-house. The deceit was 
 discovered, and a mortal struggle ensued on board the tiny bark; 
 it sunk, and many perished, Clifford among the rest. On the 
 morrow his body was found upon the beach, stiff and stark ; a 
 gaping wound in his neck showed that the waters alone had not 
 been his foe ; in his clenched hand he grasped a mass of golden 
 hairs, severed by some sharp implement from the head to which 
 they grew : as if nought else could liberate his enemy from his 
 hold. There he lay, bold Robin Clifford, the dauntless, wily 
 boy, hunted through life by his own fell passions, envy, cupidity, 
 and libertinism ; they had tracked him to this death ; his false- 
 hoods were now mute, his deceptions passed away ; he could

378 DEATH OF CLIFFORD. 
 
 never more win by his smiles, or stab by his lying words ; death 
 alone had a share in him, death and the cold sands beneath which 
 ho was interred, leaving a name, the mark of scorn, the symbol 
 of treachery. 
 
 They had struggled beneath the strangling waves, Richard 
 and his adversary. The prince was wounded in the scuffle, and 
 became enfeebled almost to insensibility before he could sever 
 from his enemy's grasp the fair locks he clutched — he swam 
 jiway, as well as he might, and, with the instinct of self-preserva- 
 tion, made for the shore — he forgot that England was a wide 
 prison — he only strove to master the fate which beat him to the 
 ground. He reached the sands — he sought the covert of some 
 near underwood, and threw himself upon the earth in blind 
 tliankfulness ; exhausted, almost inanimate, he lay there, given 
 up only to the sense of repose, and safety from death, which 
 visited his failing heart with a strange sense of pleasure. 
 
 The following morning was far advanced, before he could rouse 
 himself from this lethargy. He looked upon the waters ; but 
 the Adalid was no more to be seen — he was quite alone ; he needed 
 succour, and none was afforded him. AVell he knew that every 
 field, lane, dingle, and copse swarmed with enemies, and he 
 shuddered at the likelihood that unarmed, and weak as he was, 
 he should fall into their hands. He desired to reach London 
 again as his sole refuge ; and he journeyed, as he hoped, towards 
 it, all unknowing of the route. Noway-worn traveller in savage 
 lands, pursued by barbarous enemies, ever suffered more than 
 the offspring of Edward the Fourth amidst the alienated fields 
 of his paternal kingdom. Cold and rain succeeded to the plea- 
 sant summer weather : — during night he lay exposed to the tem- 
 pests — during day he toiled on", his limbs benumbed, his heart 
 wasted by hunger and fatigue ; yet never, at the head of the 
 Scottish chivalry, never in Burgundy or in England, did he feel 
 more resolute not to submit, but, baffling fortune and his enemy's 
 power, to save himself in spite of fate. He had wandered far 
 inland, and knew not where he was — he had indeed passed 
 beyond London, and got up as high as Barnes. It was the fourth 
 day from that of his escape — he had tasted little food, and no 
 strength remained in him, except that which gave energy to his 
 purpose. He found himself on a wide, heathy common, studded 
 with trees, or desolately open — the rainy day closed, and a bleak 
 east wind swept over the plain, and curled the leaden-coloured 
 waters of the river — his love of life, his determination not to

 few moments, he thought that he would lie down and die. 
 
 At this time another human figure appeared upon the scene.

DEATH OF CLIFFORD. 379 
 
 A Benedictine lay-brotlier, irlio, in the freedom of solitude, in 
 defiance of wind and rain, trolled a ditty, fitter for a rufiling 
 swaofgerer's bonnet, than anionic's cowl. He started not a little, 
 on perceiving our wanderer leaning against the scathed trunk of 
 a solitary tree ; nor less did he wonder when he recognized the 
 fallen prince. It was Heron himself, the magnanimous mercer, 
 who having effected his escape with a well-hoarded purse, con- 
 trived to introduce himself into the house of Bethlem, at Shene, 
 which was called the Priory. He was a little frightened to per- 
 ceive his ancient leader ; but pity succeeded to fear ; and with 
 many fair words and persuasions he induced him to permit him- 
 self to be conducted to the Priory. There, since he believed 
 himself to be dying, he might receive the last sacraments — there 
 perhaps, for, some few minutes, he might again behold his 
 Katherine. 
 
 Thus was the fugitive again led within the pale of his enemy's 
 power. The prior, a man esteemed for holiness, did not delay 
 to make his sovereign acquainted with the capture of his rival. 
 His awe of Katherine having vanished, Henry was left at 
 liberty to follow the ungenerous dictates of his grovelling spirit. 
 Many a courtier, true man or false, counselled the death of the 
 aspiring youth ; and they praised their master's magnanimity, 
 when he rejected this advice, and in lieu exposed him, whom he 
 knew to be the descendant of a line of kings, to beggarly dis- 
 grace. Thus worn and weak, the ill-fated son of York was 
 made a public spectacle of infamy. But Henry went a step too 
 far ; and, when he thrust the Scottish princess forward on the 
 scene, he turned deafeat to triumph. 
 
 He was not to die — but rather to pine out a miserable ex- 
 istence — or had the sage monarch any other scheme ? The 
 high-spirited prince was to be cooped up within' the Tower — 
 there, where the earl of Warwick wasted his wretched life. 
 Did he imagine that the resolved and ardent soul of Richard 
 would, on its revival, communicate a part of its energy to the 
 son of Clarence, and that ere long they would be enveloped in 
 one ruin? Some words had transpired that appeared to reveal 
 such an intention ; and his order to the lieutenant of the Tower, 
 that, without permitting, he should connive at any covert inter- 
 course between the two — his recommendation of a noted spy 
 and hireling to a high trust, and the order this fellow had to 
 bring each day intelligence to the palace from the prison — spoke 
 loudly of some design ; for Henry never did aught in vain. It 
 was in circulation also among the lower officers in the fortress, 
 that an attempt to escape was expected on the part of the pri- 
 soners, and that rich reward would attend its discovery.

 ■The Lady KatKerine, no longer trusting tlie good intentions of 
 the insolent tyrant, was eager to communicate with her royal 
 cousin of Scotland, to urge him to save from death or disgrace, 
 if not to eflect the liberation of him to whom he had given 
 her hand. The diiBculty of finding a messenger was great. 
 The queen, all amiable and sorrowing as she was, shrunk from 
 any act, which, if discovered, would enrage the king. Where 
 did Monina tarry while her friend was in this strait ? Of all 
 his sometime associates was there not one who would risk all to 
 retard the last steps of fate. Since York's escape she had 
 been so vigilantly guarded, that a thousand schemes she had 
 formed for her own evasion proved abortive at their very outset. 
 
 Help was at length afforded her unexpectedly, when most 
 depairmg. Edmund Plautagenet stood before her — changed 
 indeed from what he had been ; she had not seen him since the 
 siege of Exeter, where he was wounded ; but slight was his 
 bodily hurt in comparison to the death-blow his mind received. 
 
 Plantagenet was one of those concentrated characters, whose 
 very outward show of softness and gentleness serves the more 
 to force the texture of their souls to receive one indelible 
 impression. He had passed a boyhood of visions, given up to 
 might}'' aspirations and engrossing reverie. His thoughts were 
 stirring as the acts of others ; his forest-school had so tutored 
 him, that he could live in bodily repose, while his mind 
 ruminated : he could be quickened to hope and fear, to lofty 
 ambition, to generosity, and devoted courage, feeling in his 
 heart the keenest impulses — while around him were the mute 
 trees of the wild wood and pathless glades. He could be satis- 
 fied with such dreamy illusions ; so that action with him was

 never the result of physical restlessness, nor of youthful 
 emulation, nor of that stirring spirit of life which forces us to 
 abhor repose. It flowed from an imperious sense of duty ; it 
 welled up from the very sources of his soul. Other men 
 perform the various parts allotted to them, and yet are some- 
 thinor else the while ; as is the actor, even while he struts in 
 the garb of royalty : but Edmund yielded himself wholly up, 
 and was the mere creature of the thought within. 
 
 To be great and good— great from the good he should effect, 
 was his boyhood's aspiration. It is probable that, if he had not 
 been subjected to extraneous influence, he would have devoted 
 himself to religion, and become a saint or martyr ; for his all, 
 his understanding, heart, and person, would have been given 
 up to the holy cause he espoused. His beinor led to King 
 Eichard's tent^ the night before the battle of Bosworth Field, 
 gave a new and inextinguishable law to his life. Unknown 
 duties were imposed. The first and dearest was, to redeem his 
 father's soul from the guilt of murderous ambition, by elevating 
 his injured nephew to his original greatness. He devoted 
 himself to his cousin. Soon he learned to love Richard as the 
 work of his own hands. He had reared his tender infancy ; he 
 had been his tutor in martial exercises, teaching him to curb 
 the fiery steed, to wield the lance, and, more than all, to meet 
 danger in the field fearlessly : to be honourable, brave, and 
 kind. He had led him to war, and shielded him with his own 
 body from the cruel Moor. If ever they were divided, his 
 thoughts dwelt only the more carefully with him. Last, he had 
 brought him from glorious combats in Spain, to conquer his 
 ancestral kingdom, and set him up the rival of a powerful king 
 — the mark of his vengeance. 
 
 It was all over. Edmund possessed no innate strength to rise 
 from the blow ; he was a mariner on the wide ocean, without 
 compass or rudder. The universe had one central point for him ; 
 that was destroyed, and a total blank remained. York's first 
 surrender visited him as a death-stroke ; he struggled against it. 
 Enfeebled by his wound, more by despair, he passed over to 
 Ireland ; there he expected to find friends of the White Rose ; 
 he found only enemies of Duke Perkin : men eager to exculpate 
 themselves from the charges of ill faith or ingratitude, gladly 
 adopted a phraseology, or a belief, that reduced to dust the 
 golden glories of poor Edmund's idol. Perkin Warbeck ! Oh 
 thou flower of York ! thou nursling of love, though child of 
 calamity, is even thy bright name so to be tainted ? IS"ot by 
 those immediately arrayed by self-interest against thee ; but by, 
 the vulgar crew, ever eager to crush the fallen. There was^no

 Lope in Ireland. Keating, the Prior of Kilmainliam, was 
 dead. Tiie earl of Desmond was reconciled to the English 
 government. Lord Barry had fled to Spain. The citizens of 
 Cork were busy redeeming, by eager servility, their mayor's 
 disloyalty. 
 
 Overcome by these sad changes, a malignant feverl seized on 
 Edmund : in addition to every other disappointment, he had 
 the consciousness that his aid was necessary to his cousin : that 
 his absence was probably misinterpreted by his friends as 
 cowardly dereliction. York was calling on him in'vain. Monina 
 perhaps suspected his truth. ISext to the sun of his life, the 
 noble Eichard, Monina lay nearest his heart. It was a mixture 
 of many feelings; and even love, subdued by hopelessness, 
 quickened them to greater intensity. As soon as he could rise 
 from his couch, he directed his course to England. He arrived 
 in London on the day of the duke of York's worst disgrace. 
 It was reported to him aa the gossip of the town : at the fatal 
 word a mortal change seized upon his frame : his limbs were as 
 if struck by palsy ; his cheeks fell in ; his hair grew white. On 
 his arrival he had taken up his abode in a monastery in the habit 
 of a poor pilgrim : the sage monks, who beheld his state, pos- 
 sessed no leech-craft to administer his cure : he lay with 
 beating pulses and open eyes, while the work of the grave 
 appeared already in operation against him : he wasted into a 
 fleshless skeleton. And then another secret change came over 
 him ; he conquered death, and crawled forth, the ghost of what 
 he was, into the hopeless world. 
 
 He contrived to gain admission to the princess. She did not 
 recognize him, such was the pale disguise disease had put upon 
 him. His voice, hollow as from a tomb, was altered ; his 
 dark, melancholy eyes, occupying too large a portion of his face, 
 gleamed from under his streaked and wan brow. Yet his was a 
 visit of comfort, for he could do her mission to Scotland, and 
 invite the forgetful James to succour his friend and kinsman. 
 Edmund listened eagerly to this proposal : a draught of sooth- 
 ing balm descended into his frame, with the thought that yet 
 all was not lost. His physical energy almost returned : ho 
 hurried to depart — "How will you traverse this wide king- 
 dom ? " asked the lady. ** Cannot the Adalid come as before, to 
 aid and speed you on your way ? " 
 
 " The Adalid is saiHug on the far ocean sea," replied Plan- 
 tagenet ; " we are all as dead, in the eyes of De Faro and our 
 Monina."

 entered upon the gentle maiden's exculpation. He related that 
 a poor fellow lay on the bed next his in the convent hospital, 
 whom he recofrnized to be an Irishman, who had escaped from 
 Waterford, and sailed with them in the Adalid to Cornwall. 
 From him he heard the tale of what had befallen De Faro and 
 his child. He heard how the mariner had long haunted the 
 English coast waiting for an opportunity to carry off the prince ; 
 of the fatal night, when snatching his daughter from the watery 
 peril, he saw Eichard, as he believed, perish in the waves. 
 ^Yhat more had the Moorish mariner and his daughter to do 
 with this miserable, guilty island ? He called his men together ; 
 he told them his resolve finally to quit the eastern world for the 
 golden islands of the west, inviting those who were averse to 
 the voyage to go on shore at once, before the fair wind that was 
 rising should hurry them into the open sea. The poor Irishman 
 alone desired to land : before he went he saw the Spanish 
 damsel ; he described her as calm and mild, though there was 
 something unearthly in her gleaming eyes and in the solemn 
 tone of her voice. " If," she said, " you meet any of our friends, 
 any who ask for De Faro and his daughter, if you see Lady 
 Brampton, Lord Barry, or Sir Edmund Plantagenet, tell them 
 that Monina lives, that she tarries with her father, and tasks 
 herself to be his comfort and support. We seek the Western 
 Indies ; well may it betide us that we never reach the unknown 
 strand ; or we may be cast away in an uninhabited solitude, 
 where my care and companionship may stead my dear father 
 much; or I may teach the sacred truths of our religion to the 
 wild Indians, and speak the dear name of Christ to the unbap- 
 tized of those wilds ; or soften, as best I may, the cruel 
 Spaniard, and save the devoted people from their barbarity'. 
 Tell them, whichever way I look, I perceive a thousand duties 
 to which our great Taskmaster calls me, and these I live lo 
 fulfil, if so my feeble body will permit ; tell them that my only 
 hope is death ; that, and that by my obedience to the Almighty 
 will, I may partly merit to join in Paradise the earthly angel 
 who now survives there." 
 
 Tears choked further speech ; she imprinted her words by a 
 gift of gold. The boat which had been hailed, came alongside. 
 The man on board, the sails of the Adalid swelled proudly in 
 the gale ; the little caravel ran lightly along on the top of the 
 roughening waters. In less than two hours she was out of 
 sight, speeding swiftly over the sea towards the wild western 
 ocean. 
 
 Plantagenet departed ; and the princess was yet more cheered 
 when she found that no further injury 'was meditated against

 her lord. Imprisonment in the Tower was his sole punishment. 
 Her pure, g^entle mind could not divine the full extent of King 
 Henry's villany, nor gfuess how he undermined the edifice he 
 claimed praise for not levelling with the ground. 
 
 JS^or could her resigned, patient, feminine spirit conceive the 
 cruel, biting impatience of his lot that York endured. He had 
 yielded at first to the overwhelming sense of disgrace, and felt 
 that last, worst emotion of the injured, which answers the in- 
 ternal question, "What have I done so to be visited?" in the 
 poet's words, — 
 
 " I cannot charge 
 My memory with much save sorrow — but 
 I have been so beyond the common lot 
 Chastened and visited, I needs must think 
 Tliat I was wicked." 
 
 But soon his eager, eagle spirit spurned the tame debasing 
 thought : he resolved again to struggle, and at last to conquer ; 
 the fire burned brighter for its short smouldering ; almost with 
 a light heart he laughed, as he resolved again to endeavour. 
 
 His prison life was more than irksome ; it was unendurable. 
 No change, which is the soul of enjoyment, varied it. 'No sym- 
 pathy, the parent of content, came anear. In his young days 
 he had trod on the verge of life's wave, watching it recede, and 
 fancying that it would discover glittering treasures as it re- 
 treated into the ocean of eternity : now the tide ebbed sullenly ; 
 the barren sands grew dark ; and the expanse before aff'orded 
 no hope — what was to be done ? 
 
 He was in the Tower, whence he had twice escaped ; where 
 the earl of Warwick was immured, pining in fruitless vegetation, 
 rather than living. Should he do as he had done, and become 
 a cipher, a forgotten prisoner, a mere thing to wake and sleep, 
 and be as nothing ? The very dog that guards a cottage-door 
 from nightly harm had more dignity and purpose in his life 
 than this victim of ambition. The bird that alighted on the sill 
 of his iron-barred casement, and carried off a crumb for her 
 nestlings, was an emblem of utility and freedom in comparison, 
 which Warwick, cut off from all, must weep to mark. How 
 different was Kichard's fate ; he had dear friends i*eady to risk 
 all for him, whose life's sacrifice he could repay only by being 
 true to himself; he had a wife, wedded to him in youth's early 
 flower, whose happiness was unalterably linked to his. He had 
 courage, fortitude, energy ; he would not cast these gifts away, 
 a thankless boon : he valued them at their price : if death 
 crowned his efforts, it were well ; he was a mere toy in the 
 hands of God, and he submitted ; but as a man, he was ready 
 to cope with men, and though defeated never to be vanquished.

THE TOWEB. 385 
 
 Not a montli after his removal to the Tower he had observed 
 his facilities, marked his instruments, and resolved to enter on. 
 his schemes : they were quickened by other circumstances. 
 
 Warwick heard of his cousin's arrival ; and he believed this 
 to be the signal of his own deliverance. His first chief desire 
 was to have communication with him. Among his attendants 
 there was one to whom he could apply ; he was a lank, tall 
 fellow, with little understanding and but one idea — gratitude to 
 the duke of Clarence. This man, called Roger, and nicknamed 
 Long Roger, his length being his chief distinction, had been 
 very poor, and burthened besides with several infant children : 
 accidents and a bad season brought them to the verge of starva- 
 tion, when a chance threw him in the way of the duke of Cla- 
 rence, who got him made servitor in the Tower. When this 
 unfortunate prince was imprisoned within its fatal walls. Long 
 Roger underwent a thousand perils to wait on him by stealth, 
 and to do what service he might. Long Roger had a prodigious 
 appetite, and his chief delight was to smuggle dainties, cooked 
 by his Madge, into the prison chamber of the'duke. The manner 
 of Clarence's death, which Roger affirmed to accord with the 
 popular tradition, alone consoled the faithful sympathizing 
 fellow. 'Now he had turned the key for thirteen years on the 
 duke's hapless son : in spite of his watchful care and proffered 
 cates, he had seen the poor youth dwindle to a skeleton, when 
 suddenly the progress of delay was checked by Our Lady : it 
 was a miracle to see Lord Edward grow fat and comely to look 
 upon, changing his woe-begone looks into gracious smiles : by 
 the mass, there was witchcraft in it ! Warwick often thanked 
 Long Roger, and told him what he would do when restored to 
 freedom and rank : which will never be, Roger said, except 
 among the saints in Paradise ; unless it pleased God to remove 
 his majesty, when my lady the queen should fully know how 
 fervently her cousin prayed for her ; and, forsooth, with sweet 
 prince Arthur, his royal mother would be all powerful. Long 
 Roger's visions went not beyond. He never imagined the pos- 
 sibility of effecting the earl's escape ; his limited understanding 
 suggested no relief, save a bottle of Canary, or bunches of white 
 roses in June, which in fact was Dame Madge's feminine idea ; 
 and often had the simple flowers soothed Warwick's care. To 
 this man the poor prisoner applied, to enable him to see and 
 converse with the newly arrived Richard : two are better than 
 one to a feast ; and, the next time Roger meditated a dainty 
 supper for his lord, he resolved to endeavour that York should 
 partake it with him as a guest. 
 
 In his own guileless way, the simple-hearted man began to

386 IMPRISONMENT IN THE TOWEE. 
 
 practise on and bribe one of his fellows, without ■whom it had 
 been difficult to accomplish his desire. Abel Blewet had lately- 
 been appointed to his service : he was nearly a dwarf,, with 
 bushy eyebrows and red hair : there was something of ill omen 
 in his physiognomy, but as the tall yeoman looked over the 
 bead of his coinrade, his courage rose : " The whipper-snapper 
 could not rebuff me," he thought, as he drew himself up to his 
 full height, and began to propound the mighty deed of con- 
 ducting Perkin by mistake to the Lord Edward's chamber, on 
 his return from vespers. Roger paused suddenly ; for, in spite 
 of his stature, he was appalled by the glance Blewet shot up 
 from under his penthouses of brows : still he gave a wiUing 
 assent, and even took upon himself the chief risk of the under- 
 taking. 
 
 The following evening, while Eichard was yet pondering how 
 to commence his machinations, undecided, though resolved ; and 
 while he made up his mind not to betray his thoughts to the 
 sinister-looking being before him, he was surprised to find 
 that he was led through an unaccustomed gallery ; and still 
 more on entering the chamber into which he was introduced, to 
 recognise it as that where he had unexpectedly found refuge 
 during his last visit to the Tower, and to perceive that Warwick 
 himself was there expecting him. 
 
 Was this the thin, wasted being he had seen three years be- 
 fore ? Had AVarwick been then set free to hunt upon the hills, 
 he had not regained more flesh and bloom than now that hope 
 had been his only medicine. His cousin York had inspired him 
 with marvellous confidence ; his last entrance into the formi- 
 dable Tower, and his speedy exit, had appeared a miracle to the 
 poor earl, to whom these high walls and sad chambers formed a 
 world, from which, as from the larger one, death only promised 
 egress. He had pined and wasted in his appetite to be free, to be 
 without those gates, beyond that fosse and giant battlements that 
 girded him in : these portentous, insuperable obstacles were mere 
 cobweb chains to Eichard. He had come in, he had departed, 
 and all as easily, so Warwick thought, as the unregarded liy, that 
 had perhaps flown from Westminster, from Elizabeth's chamber, 
 to light upon his cheek. In all the subsequent tales of York's 
 checks and overthrow, he smiled at the idea that one born to 
 victory could be thus overcome. He laughed at the chains 
 Henry had thrown over him ; and his transfer to the Tower 
 elated him with a firm belief that liberty was at hand. Dwell- 
 ing on these thoughts, Warwick ceased to be the dead alive ; he 
 was cheerful, erect, elastic in his gait, his complexion glowed 
 with health, while sickness lingered still on the cheek of the

 younger Plantagenet, and a more subdued spirit dwelt in his 
 heart. 
 
 Long Koger belield tlie cousins embrace : he heard the earl 
 call him, named Perkin, his liege, and most dear kinsman : from 
 that moment the opprobrious name was banished from Roger's 
 lips : he was convinced of York's truth, and the Lord Edward's 
 friend became an object of reverence and of love. 
 
 CHAPTER LY. 
 
 ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. 
 
 Gentle cousin, 
 If you be seen, you perish instantly 
 For breaking prison. . ■ 
 
 No, no, cousin, 
 I will no more be hidden, nor put off 
 This great adventure to a second trial. 
 
 Two Noble Kivsmex. 
 
 QuiCE on the first greeting followed "Warwick's question. 
 " And, noble cousin, what have you projected ? when shall we 
 escape ? " 
 
 Richard's being in durance with him, seemed sufficient pledge, 
 that without delay they should both be free. While York, 
 wearied by opposition to his mighty foe, just foiled in his endea- 
 vours to preserve his freedom, even when he had attained it, saw 
 giant obstacles in his path ; and, although resolved to endeavour 
 all, was fully conscious of the fatal end that must' wait upon his 
 too probable failure. His reply was dictated by these feelings ; 
 he was averse to drag one so inexperienced, and so unhappy, into 
 the pit he believed that he was digging for himself. He besought 
 the earl well to weigh the value he set upon life ; to place the 
 fatal scaffold in prospect ; to teach himself to know what death 
 was, and to be ready to meet it, before he planned escape from 
 the wily Tudor. Warwick listened with impatient wonder ; but 
 when Richard concluded with affirming, that he himself, in sober 
 sadness, preferred hazarding all to the remaining in prison, 
 and that he would be free, the earl's countenance again grew 
 light and gladsome. " But when, coz — when ? " was still his 
 eager question.

388 ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. 
 
 Thus they had changed characters. Warwick, so many years 
 secluded from the world, was in total ignorance of its ways. 
 Had the Tower-gates been opened to him, he had trembled to 
 walk forth alone ; but restraint had made him feminine ; and 
 with his cousin he would have rushed upon an army of spears, 
 in sure belief that some unseen aegis would protect him. His 
 position rendered him timid, indolent, and dependent ; but he 
 relied on Richard, as a woman on her lover. York beheld all 
 things in their clear, true light ; he was aware of every difl&- 
 culty ; of the means he possessed for overcoming them, and of 
 the hazards he ran in using these means. A sentiment, born of 
 the highest generosity made him hesitate before he concerted 
 any plan with Warwick. It was not alone that he was averse 
 to risking another life ; but he felt that his cause would receive 
 advantage from this link with an undoubted Plantagenet ; nay, 
 that, in the prison itself, the attachment and respect felt towards 
 the son of Clarence, by some of the very men he meant to use, 
 would serve him. That he should reap benefit from exposing the 
 ill-fated prince to untried dangers, revolted his high and inde- 
 pendent nature. Warwick had recourse to many an entreaty 
 and persuasion, ere he brought Richard to consent that their 
 fortunes should be joined, and that, last of the White Rose, they 
 ■would rise or fall together. Still York was obliged to check his 
 cousin's impatience, and to show that they must slowly work out 
 the end they had in view. 
 
 To gratify the earl's greedy curiosity, York related his adven- 
 tures ; they afforded him an inexhaustible fund of surprise and 
 delight. He sighed over his tale of wedded happiness ; and 
 half wondered that angelic woman, seated high on the throne 
 of loveliness and love, should deign to devote herself for man. 
 A pang, not of envy, but of regret, on comparing their fates, 
 shot across him ; soon the usual current of feeling returned ; 
 and when he heard that his idolized, lost Elizabeth, was the 
 friend and companion of the devoted wife of York, his affec- 
 tion for Richard was increased. Night was far advanced 
 before they separated, and then only in certain expectation of 
 meeting again. 
 
 York's hopes grew brighter, and he indulged in visions of 
 the future, which lately had been so blank. He verily believed 
 that he might escape, though still he doubted whether he 
 should. He remembered the fondness of the duchess of Bur- 
 gundy for her brother Clarence, and how she had deplored the 
 hard destiny of his offspring ; he would present that son, libe- 
 Tated by him, to her. His junction with the prince must revive 
 the old Yorkists in his favour; this worst blast of fortune

 might be the gale to speed him to the harbour of his hopes. 
 The royal cousins met again and again ; nor was it long before 
 their own desires, and Henry's craft, began to weave that fatal 
 web which entangled them even in the very mode the hard- 
 hearted king devised. » j 
 
 Summer was gone : quicker than he was wont, the sun with- 
 drew his embattled array of light and heat ; and cold and 
 tempest, erewhile driven to mountain fastnesses, or to their owe. 
 frozen kingdoms in the north, took courage and force, and broke 
 with wild fury upon the defenceless world : the bleak winde 
 were their coursers ; savagely they yelled and howled over the 
 land they desolated. First, the growth of flowers was their 
 prey ; the fruits, and then the verdure of the earth, while 
 the sun, each day retreating, afforded further scope to their 
 inroads. York resolved not to pass another winter in prisoHc 
 He had quickly perceived that his purpose could only be effected 
 by corrupting their guards, and then all would depend upon the 
 fidelity of these men. His first attempts were followed by an 
 almost too easy success : good-hearted, dull-headed Long Hoger 
 heard with unreplyiug credulity the assertions of Warwick, that 
 Richard must succeed in all he undertook, and readily promised 
 his aid. Abel Blewet, in spite of hi3 dogged, sinister aspects 
 yielded at once to the seduction of a promised bribe. Two 
 others, by his advice, were associated as necessary to their suc- 
 cess. Strangeways, a ruffling drunken fellow, who had been 
 thrice dismissed, but whose pretty wife each time procured his 
 reappointment ; and Astwood, a saving miser, who lent money 
 to his fellow- servitors on usury. With these instruments the 
 cousins went to work. Warwick in full belief of success x 
 York, perceiving treason and discovery close to them, but ready 
 to defy these bloodhounds to their worst. 
 
 " And now, coz," said Warwick, "in very truth there needs 
 no further delay. Methinks were the drawbridge down, you 
 would mistrust some gin, and wait to throw an arch of your 
 own across the moat. Sooth, my lord, I am a weary of your 
 sloth." 
 
 There was a caressing sweetness in Warwick's voice and 
 manner : an ignorant, indolent, confiding enthusiasm, so unlike 
 quick-witted Clifford, or au}^ of Duke Richard's former friends, 
 that he felt a new emotion towards him — hitherto he had been the 
 protected, served, and waited on, of his associates, now he played 
 the protector and the guardian, 
 
 " My gentle cousin," he replied, '•' even as you trust, so you 
 shall find me — wait but a little, and all will be past. Yet I 
 grieve to say, where you see escape, I perceive an ambushment

 of deatli ; and, thougli ready to face the grim skeleton, we must 
 arm ourselves against him. I wish I could show you even as I 
 see, the dangers that environ us— perhaps you would shrink ; 
 and it is yet time. What do you do ? Not only plan escape, 
 hut ally yourself, and give the sanction of your untarnished 
 name, to one whom Tudor brands as an impostor, and abhors as 
 a rival. His vengeance will fall heavily for this deed, if he 
 reach yon. While a few years, like the many already gone by, 
 may lead him to his grave, and you to liberty. I have too often 
 met danger to be frightened by him : and I endure worse than 
 death, each day I pass of youth, apart my sweet White Eose. 
 You have no lady-love to beckon you across the path of peril. 
 Bethink you well, my ever dear lord, will you not regret this 
 prison, when the cruel axe glitters before your eyes?" 
 
 " Do you refuse then to take me with you?" said Warwick, 
 mournfully. 
 
 " Be the choice yours ; to go with me is fraught with danger 
 —to stay — " 
 
 " Hush, cousin I" cried the earl, eagerly, " speak not the ill- 
 omened word. Stay, — to endure days and nights of guarded 
 doors ; to eat viands served up poisoned by the jailor's touch ; 
 to see the sky but through those iron bars ; alas ! in my dreams, 
 when heaven and its stars are before me, they are crossed and 
 paled by those accursed hnes. Give me but an hour to tread 
 earth a free man — or, mark, cousin; sometimes I win good 
 [Roger to lead me to the roof of the White Tower ; it is high, 
 and overhangs the deep, dangerous river — the day you quit my 
 side, I seek that tower, I leap from its height, and the cold 
 waters shall drink up my being, rather than I endure another 
 hour my prison-life." 
 
 *' My dear, dear cousin," said York, "it is written by the 
 Fates, and I yield — our fortunes shall be one. A few days now 
 brings the hour ; it will move along the dial ; it will become a 
 portion of past time — what it will leave us, is in the hands of God." 
 
 That hour came — full soon it came — the evening hour which 
 preceded their escape. Long Eoger served supper to the kins- 
 men, the last they were to partake within the fated walls. The 
 poor fellow heaved a bitter sigh, as he waited by his lord's chair. 
 ** Thou art downcast, good Roger," said the earl, " pledge me, 
 my man, in this ruby wine of Burgundy — think of to-mon-ow, 
 not of to-night — to-morrow the deed will be done." 
 
 Hoger quaffed the proffered bowl — he set it down with 
 another sigh, almost a groan, adding, "Better drown reason 
 than hfe in the vat!" Then recollecting to what he alluded, 
 and before whom, he blushed scarlet to his very ears, and like a

 bashful man he made it worse by going on blunderingly, " I was 
 never handy at these sort of things ; it is for all the world like 
 turning out of a warm bed on a cold snowy morning, only to think 
 of them — and Ajhen they are about, — by the Cross, I thought no 
 hole far enough or dark enough, when my lord your father—" 
 
 " JRoger ! " exclaimed Warwick. 
 
 The wine had not decreased the man's terror, but it had 
 opened his mouth, and taken away his discretion ; he con- 
 tinued : "It was an awful night. We all knew what was going 
 to be done. I am sure, as Thomas Paulet said, we heard our 
 very hearts beat. Then there was grim-faced Hobler, who at 
 the judgment might be taken for the born twin of Master Abel, 
 only he was taller by a span — even he looked uglier, nor spoke 
 above his breath — ' Is he at his prayers ? ' asked he, and Sir 
 Brakenbury was as white as the earth itself — it was the beginning 
 of Lent ; and the snow lay three feet deep on it." 
 
 By no uncommon law of our nature, the dread design of the 
 present night awoke keen recollection in the usually drowsy 
 mind of this man. At first, with thrilling horror, Warwick in- 
 terrupted him, but now the very terrors of the theme he chose 
 assumed an awful charm — he was fascinated to listen, while his 
 knees knocked together. Hichard felt also the magic of such 
 perilous excitement. 
 
 " Oh, Lord Edward," continued lloger, "these walls have 
 seen fiendly sights — the blood of many a Plantagenet, York, or 
 Lancaster, is on its pavement. Was it not in this room that the 
 pious king Saint Henry, as Father Piers calls him — you will 
 not sleep another night in it, so there is no harm now, telling 
 you that his poor ghost has been seen on the battlements coming 
 from this very chamber, where he was murthered." 
 
 The night wind rushed round the massy walls, the autumnal 
 wind, fierce and howling — York started up. "No more of this 
 unreason, while we need all our strength, and God's grace to 
 boot, to nerve us to our task. Oh, ghost of Lancaster ! if 
 indeed thou hauntest this spot, where those akin to me did the 
 foul deed, be thy pious soul propitiated now; many a mass shall 
 be told for thy repose ? " 
 
 Hoger crossed himself, and said an Ave ; then in his usual 
 voice he rejoined, " Would the thing did not require blood. 
 Master Abel vows by the saints — 'twere better when men make 
 bad oaths to swear by the fiends — that Sir John must die ; old 
 wrinkled Astwood squeaks out, " By'r Lady, it were not worth 
 while, with only promises for reward, if we have not the rifling 
 of the lieutenant's private chamber. They are bloody-minded 
 men, my lord ; Mat Strangeways, when he is sober, and I, fast-

 ing or feasting, hold out that we might bind him, and get the 
 keys.' * Blocihead,' says Master Blewet, saving your presence, 
 ' thou goest the -vray to hang us all.' " 
 
 Another goblet had set Roger talking. Warwick had quitted 
 the table. He threw open the casement : it was very dark, and 
 the wind howled fearfully — " Oh, iron bars of my prison-house," 
 cried the ill-fated prince, " can only midnight-murder wrench ye 
 asunder ? It is a dread act to disobey God's word, and lay the 
 soul under mortal sin — must it be done ? " 
 
 *' My dear cousin," said York, " do not mistake — a month ago 
 the choice was yours ; now there is no going back. We have no 
 right to draw these poor men into peril, and then to quarrel at 
 the precaution they take for their safeties. We said, ay, when 
 the matter was proposed. Again I repeat the word ; they must 
 look to it, who so savagely have driven us to the fatal pass. 
 When Digby undertook the ungentle task of jailor, he knew that 
 he must hold it at the hazard of his life." 
 
 " Sir John has ever been kind tome," said Warwick, "forgive 
 the word, my lord, I am firm now — away with mercy ! To win 
 an easy egress from these murderous walls, I could myself plant 
 the dagger." 
 
 " We are not executioners," interrupted the duke, who felt 
 nor.e of Warwick's vacillations, now sinking beneath the required 
 tone, now wound up far above it, and was perfectly calm, though 
 his heart, he scarce knew why, entertained no hope of success. 
 Warwick believed that he should win, and mourned the losers in 
 the frightful game. E-ichard knew that he might fail, and 
 assuredly would, did he not meet each necessity and hazard with 
 a dauntless spirit. 
 
 The sound of a bell from a neighbouring convent was brought 
 fitfully by the wind-—" They are ringing matins — there is our 
 signal," cried E-oger. 
 
 " And Digby's knell." The door of the chamber opened as 
 Warwick said these words, and Blewet, with his usual catlike 
 pace, slid in ; he walked straight up to Hoger, and casting on him 
 a glance from under his brows, said only, " Come." 
 
 "Are all at rest ? " asked the earl. 
 
 " Two hours agone," said Master Abel, " I have kept myself 
 awake sharpening my steel:" he touched the handle of a huge 
 butcher's knife stuck in his girdle, whose glittering blade did 
 credit to his care. Warwick turned pale and sick. *\It will be 
 dulled anon," continued Blewet. 
 
 " Where are thy comrades ? " Richard asked. 
 
 "They wait at the end of the corridor — Master Astwood 
 is counting his gains. Come, Long Roger."

ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. 393 
 
 Poor Eoger followed liim to the door, then turning to the 
 princes ; " My royal masters," said he, " if this deed goes ill, 
 and I never see ye more, by Christ and his Cross, I pray a 
 blessing on ye ; if I may pray, but by the mass I fear I shall 
 never pray, nor sup more." 
 
 They were gone — Warwick strove to look, to be firm, but he 
 grew ashy white — a door clapped to at a distance made him 
 almost faint. Richard was pale also ; but his hand shook not in 
 the least, as he presented a cup of wine to his cousin. " Give 
 me water rather," said the earl, shuddering, " that cup is red 
 — hark — it is his groans ! " 
 
 " It is the wind around the turret, where my liege and brother 
 died," said York, endeavouring to give other thoughts to the 
 poor prince, who cried, — 
 
 *' It is the hell-born laugh of fiends viewing the deed." With 
 the breeze indeed came a sound of laughter. " Are we betrayed ! " 
 cried York : but the sound passed away in wailing. Warwick 
 was on his knees— "I cannot pray," he cried, " a sea of blood is 
 before me." 
 
 " Hush ! " 
 
 Steps now approached along the corridor, and Blewet, his 
 stained, half-wiped knife in his hand, appeared — Again the 
 monosyllable " Come," was pronounced — fraught with how 
 different a meaning. A life had been torn from an innocent 
 breast since then by that fell instrument. The princes, awe- 
 struck, one trembling with dread, the other striving to quell his 
 horror for a murderer, followed him, as he led through the 
 gallery — at the end stood Astwood with a bunch of keys — there 
 were no stains on his hands ; he looked anxious, but brightened 
 up when he saw the prisoners. 
 
 They trod stealthily along. Warwick's faltering steps scarce 
 kept pace with their conductor's. After passing through many 
 narrow high passages, they reached a low postern door. Astwood 
 put the key in the lock — the sound was magical to the fearful 
 earl. " Farewell, old frightful walls," he cried ; " farewell, dark 
 murderous prison-house,; the Foul Fiend possess thee ! such is 
 my benison." 
 
 Blewet looked at him — York marked the sarcasm, the scorn 
 of his glance — the gate meanwhile was opened ; at that moment 
 a clash of arms was heard. " The sentinels at the eastern gate," 
 remarked Abel. 
 
 " God grant it ! " cried Warwick, " God grant— yet can it be 1 
 and am I free ? " 
 
 He rushed through the open door, intent to seize upon liberty, 
 as Tantalus on his forbidden feast— his first step beyond the

394 THE TEIAL. 
 
 threshold of his prison was followed by a shriek — almost a 
 woman's shriek, it was so shrill and piercing. What he quailed 
 before, gave presence of mind to York — experienced in ills. 
 Whatever the new evil might be, he went out to meet it calmly. 
 A party of archers and yeomen were drawn up in the court- 
 yard. " This truly is a mime," he said, " in which one at least 
 wins. Our good lieutenant is safe ; we are lost." 
 
 Grim Sir John had much disliked even this masque of murder. 
 He saw their seizure with a grin of delight. He abhorred 
 [Richard, as the prime mover of the meditated assassination ; but 
 he hated Warwick more, who thus could lay in ambush for the 
 life of one, who he believed had been a most courteous and soft- 
 hearted jailor to him — he commanded his myrmidons to lead the 
 royal kinsmen to the strongest ward-rooms of the Tower, with 
 dogged, savage joy. 
 
 In dark and separate cells, in solitude and night, these ill-fated 
 victims of craft and ambition were consigned to biting reflection 
 and sinister anticipation. Warwick, worn out by the unusual 
 excitement of the last weeks, by his eager hopes, and over- 
 whelming despair, had no one thought, but ten thousand 
 thoughts, making a chaos and hell of his poor heart. E,ichard 
 felt more for his cousin than for himself. "But for me," he 
 repeated internally, "he had still been a patient prisoner. Yet 
 to break prison is not crime capital — he may yet be saved. 
 Elizabeth will intercede ; Tudor, for very shame, cannot do fur- 
 ther wrong to one so near akin, so powerless and unfortunate. 
 Por myself: — I am dead already : the duke of York died, when 
 first I became a slave. So that my memory survive in my own 
 White Rose's heart — let the victor dispose at his pleasure of this 
 mere shell of Richard."

 The morning of the first of November dawned : a cheery day. 
 Men went to their usual works : the earth, despoiled of her 
 summer garniture, yet bore the change with sober content ; for

 the sun shone, and soft airs, despite the coming winter, lightly 
 shook the scant and altered foliage^of the woods : — 
 
 All rose to do the task He set to each. 
 
 Who shaped us to His ends, and not our own. 
 
 And many rose 
 Whose woe was such, that fear became desire. 
 
 Among such fate-hunted victims was tha duke of York, Hope 
 had died in his heart ; and his few remaining days were only to 
 be spent in celebrating her dark funeral. Morning opened its 
 eyes on Prince Eichard's dungeon, showing him vanquished by 
 grievous overthrow and change. To look back through his 
 tumultuous life, to dwell upon its chances, to think of the many 
 who had suffered for him, were sad but fitting thoughts, to which 
 he betook himself, till death became lovely in his eyes. But 
 intermingled with such retrospection were other memories : his 
 own sweet love was before him, in her tears or smiles ; he looked 
 into her dear eyes, he closed his own, and thrilling kisses pressed 
 his burning lips, and soft, white arms were round him ; at 
 thought of such he grew impatient of his chains, and the fearful 
 cutting off from all that awaited him. He began to calculate on 
 the probability that his life would be spared, and grew cowardly 
 the while ; to feed upon those roseate lips, to drink life from 
 those eyes, to clasp his beautiful, fond wife, feeling that beyond 
 the circle of his arms nought existed worthy his desires, became 
 a fierce, impatient hunger, to gratify which he would call him- 
 self impostor, give up fame and reputation, and become Perkin 
 Warbeck in all men's eyes. 
 
 There was but one refuge from this battle of youth and life 
 with the grim skeleton. With a strong effort he endeavoured to 
 turn his attention from earth, its victor woes, and still more 
 tyrant joys, to the heaven where alone his future lay. The 
 struggle was difficult, but he effected it : prayer brought resig- 
 nation, calm ; so when his soul, still linked to his mortal frame, 
 and slave to its instincts, again returned to earth, it was with 
 milder wishes and subdued regrets. Monina's lovely form wan- 
 dered into his mind ; she was an angel now, a blessed spirit, he 
 believed ; for, what deceived her, deceived him ; and he fancied 
 that he alone had escaped from the watery perils of that night : 
 she had arrived there, where he soon should be, in the serene 
 immutability of eternal life ; he began, in the revulsion of his 
 thoughts, to pity those destined still to exist. Earth was a 
 scathed planet, a roofless, shelterless home ; a wild where the 
 human soul wandered a little interval, tortured by sharp, cruel 
 storms ; lost in thorny, entangled brakes ; weary repining, till

 the hour came when it could soar to its native birthplace, and 
 find refuge from its ills in promised Paradise. 
 
 His cell was indeed the haven of peace, compared to the tur- 
 bid, frightful atmosphere in which his Katherine Hved. Edmund 
 had not returned ; every attempt she made to communicate with 
 Scotland or Burgundy failed. She had passed a summer of 
 wretchedness, nor could the tender attention of Elizabeth soothe 
 her. In spite of all, the poor queen was almost happier than 
 she had ever been ; for many years she had been " the cannibal 
 of her own heart," devouring her griefs in voiceless, friendless, 
 solitude ; her very joys, and they were those of maternity, were 
 locked up in her own bosom. It was the birth of happiness to 
 share her griefs with another ; that other being so gentle, so 
 wise, and yet so sensitive, as the fair White E-ose, who con- 
 cealed her own worst pains, to soothe those of one possessing less 
 fortitude and fewer internal resources than herself. Yet, while 
 thus she forgot herself, she never quitted in thought her 
 Eichard's side ; since the day she had seen him delivered over 
 to ignominious punishment, pale and ill, he was as it were 
 stamped on every outward object, an image placed between her 
 and her thoughts ; for, while those were employed apparently on. 
 many things, he, in truth, was their first, last, all-possessing 
 idea, more engrossing than her own identity. At one time she 
 spent every efi'ort to obtain an interview with him in prison ; and 
 then she learned, through covert means, of the plots carrying on 
 in the Tower for his escape, while the name of Warwick, min- 
 gling in the tale, roused the latent feehngs of Elizabeth. When 
 the last, worst hour came, it was less replete with pain than these 
 miserable, unquiet days, and sleepless, tearful nights ; the never- 
 ending, still-beginning round of hours, spent in fear, doubt, and 
 agonizing prayer. 
 
 After a restless night, the princess opened her eyes upon the 
 day, and felt even the usual weight at her heavy foreboding 
 heart increased. The tale was soon told of Eichard's attempted 
 escape and failure: "What can be done?" "Nothing; God 
 has delivered the innocent into the hands of the cruel ; the cruel, 
 to whom mercy is as unknown as, methinks, it is even to the 
 awful Power who rules our miserable lives." Such words, with 
 a passionate burst of tears, burst from the timid Elizabeth, whose 
 crushed and burning heart even arraigned the Deity for the 
 agony she endured. 
 
 Eatheriue looked on her with sweet compassion, " Gentle 
 one," she said, " what new spirit puts such strange speech into 
 your mouth, whose murmurings heretofore were those of 
 piety ? "

 " It is a bad world," continued the queen ; " and, if I become 
 bad in it, perchance I shall prosper, and have power to save : I 
 have been too mild, too self-communing and self-condemning ; 
 and the frightful result is, that the sole being that ever loved me, 
 perishes on the scaffold. Both will perish, my White Rose, doubt 
 it not. Your own York, and my devoted only loved Edward. In 
 his prison I have been his dream ; he breaks it, not to find liberty 
 again, but Elizabeth. Wretched boy ! knows he not that he 
 shall never again find her, who roamed with a free spirit the 
 woodland glades, talking to him of the future, as of a scene 
 painted to my will ; faded, outworn, a degraded slave — I am 
 not Elizabeth." 
 
 "Did you know the dearest truth of religion," replied Xathe- 
 rine, " you would feel that she, who has been tried, and come 
 out pure, is a far nobler being than — " 
 
 " I am not pure, not innocent ; much you mistake me," said 
 the queen : " wicked, impious thoughts harbour in my heart, 
 and pollute my soul, even beyond the hope of mediation. Some- 
 times I hate my beautiful children because they are his ; some- 
 times in the dark hour of night, I renounce my nuptial vow, 
 and lend ready, willing ear to fiendish whisperings which borrow 
 Edward's voice. I court sleep, because he wanders into my 
 dreams: and — what do I say, what am I revealing? Lady, 
 judge me not : you married him you loved, fulfilling thus the 
 best destiny that can be given in this hard world to woman, 
 whose life is merely love. Though he perish in his youth, and 
 you weep for him for ever, hug yourself in the blessed know- 
 ledge that your fate is bright as angels : for we reap celestial 
 joys, when love and duty, twined in sisterly embrace, take up 
 their abode together within us : and I — but Katherine, did you 
 hear me ? — They perish even as I speak : his cruel heart knows 
 no touch of mercy, and they perish." 
 
 *' They shall not, dearest," said York's White Rose ; " it cannot 
 be, that so foul a blot darken our whole lives. No; there are 
 words and looks and tones that may persuade. Alas ! were we 
 more holy, surely a miracle might be vouchsafed, nor this 
 Pharaoh harden his heart for ever." 
 
 All her love-iaden soul beaming in her eyes, with a voice that 
 even thrilled him, though it moved him not, the White Rose 
 addressed Henry. She had yet to learn that a tyrant's smile is 
 more fatal than his frown : he was all courtesy, for he was re- 
 solved, implacable ; and she gathered hope from what proved to 
 be the parent of despair. She spoke with so much energy, yet 
 simplicity, in the cause of goodness, and urged so sweetly her 
 debt of gratitude; telling him, how from the altar of their

 hearts, prayers would rise to the Eternal, fraught with blessings 
 to him, that he encouracred her to go on, that still he might 
 gaze on lineaments, which nobility of soul, the softest tender- 
 ness, and exalted belief in good, painted with angelic hues. At 
 length he replied that his council were examining witnesses, 
 that her cause depended on facts, on its own justice ; that he 
 hoped report had blackened the crimes of these rash men ; for 
 her sake he sincerely hoped their guilt, as it was detailed to 
 him, had been exaggerated. 
 
 Por a moment the princess was unaware what all this jargon 
 might mean ; his next words were more perspicuous. " Indeed, 
 fair dame, you must forget this coil : if I consent, for the wel- 
 fare of my kingdom, to sacrifice the queen's nearest relative, 
 you also must resign yourself to a necessity from which there 
 is no appeal. Hereafter you will perceive that you gain, instead 
 of losing by an act of justice which you passionately call cruelty : 
 it is mercy, heaven's mercy doubtless, that breaks the link be- 
 tween a royal princess and a baseborn impostor." 
 
 A sudden fear thrilled Katherine : " You cannot mean that 
 he should die," she cried; "for your own sake, for your chil- 
 dren's sake, on whom your sins will be visited, you cannot intend 
 such murder : vou dare not ; for the whole world would rise 
 against the unchristian king who sheds his kinsman's blood. 
 All Europe, the secret hearts of those nearest to you, your own 
 knowledge, all proclaim your victim, your rival — to be your 
 brother, and will brand you a fratricide. You are Lancaster, 
 your ancestors were kings, you conquered this realm in their 
 name, and may reign over it in peace of conscience ; but not so 
 may you destroy the duke of York. His mother avouched him, 
 the duchess of Burgundy acknowledges him ; I was given to him 
 by my royal cousin, as to one of equal rank, and he upholds 
 him. More than all, his princely self declares the truth ; nor 
 can evil counsellors, nor false chroniclers, stand between you 
 and heaven and the avenging world. You vainly seek to heap 
 accusation on him you term Crookback's head : time will affix 
 the worst indelible stain upon you. You cannot, will not slay 
 him." 
 
 What were words to the fi^xed mind of Henry ? A summer 
 breeze, whispering round a tempest-withstanding watch-towers- 
 he might grow chill at this echo of the fears his own heart 
 spoke : but still he smiled, and his purpose was unshaken. 
 
 It became known that the princes were to be arraigned for 
 treason : first the unhappy, misnamed Perkin was tried, by the 
 common courts, in Westminster Hall. When a despot gives up 
 the execution of his revenge to the course of law, it is only

 because he wishes to get rid of passing the sentence of death 
 upon his single authority, and to make the dread voice of 
 misnamed justice, and its executors, the abettors of his 
 crime. 
 
 When tragedy arrays itself in the formal robes of law, it 
 becomes more heart-rending, more odious, than in any other 
 guise. When sickness threatens to deprive us of one, round 
 whom our heart-strings have twined — we think inextricably — 
 the skill of man is our friend : if merciless tempest be the mur- 
 derer, we feel that it obeys One whose ways are inscrutable, 
 while we strive to believe that they are good. Groping in dark- 
 ness, we teach our hearts the bitter lesson of resignation. Nor 
 do we hate nor blame the wild winds and murderous waves, 
 though they have drunk up a life more precious and more be- 
 loved than words have power to speak. But that man's autho- 
 rity should destroy the life of his fellow-man ; that he who is 
 powerful, should, for his own security and benefit, drive into 
 the darksome void of the tomb one united to our sun- visited 
 earth by ties of tenderness and love — one whose mind was the 
 abode of honour and virtue ; to know that the word of man 
 could still bind to its earthly tabernacle the being, voice, looks, 
 thoughts, afiections of our all ; and yet that the man of power 
 unlocks the secret chamber, rifles it of all its treasures, and 
 gives us, for the living mansion of the soul, a low, voiceless 
 grave : — against such tyranny, the softest heart must rebel ; 
 nor scarcely could religion in its most powerful guise, the Ca- 
 tholic religion, vrhich almost tore aside for its votaries the veil 
 between time and eternity, teach submission to the victims. 
 
 Days flowed on. However replete with event, the past is but 
 a point to us ; however empty, the present pervades all things. 
 And when that present is freighted with our whole futurity, it 
 is as an adamantine chain binding us to the hour ; there is no 
 escape from its omnipotence and omnipresence ; it is as the all- 
 covering sky. We shut our eyes ; the monster's hollow breath 
 is on our cheek ; we look on all sides : from each his horrid 
 eyes glare on us ; we would sleep ; he whispers dreams. Are 
 we intelligible ? Will those possessed by present tell us 
 whether any bondage, any Bastille, can suggest ideas of more 
 frightful tyranny, misery, than the cruel present, which clings 
 to us, and cannot be removed. 
 
 " It is 80 ; he attempted to escape, and was discovered ; he is 
 low in his dungeon; his dear eyes are faint from disappointed 
 hope. He will be tried. Tyranny will go forth in a masque, 
 and with hideous antics fancy that she mantles with a decorous 
 garb her blood-thirsty acts. He will be condemned ; but he will

 not die ! not die ! Oh no, my Richard is immorfcal — he cannot 
 DIE ! " 
 
 " My royal cousin, when you gave me to my sweet love, and 
 pledged your word that in weal or woe I should be his ; and I 
 promised myself still dearer things, to be the guardian angel 
 and tutelar genius of his life ; and took pleasure, fond, foolish 
 girl that I was, in the anticipation of misfortunes that I should 
 rob of all power to hurt ; no tliought, among the many that 
 strayed into futurity, told me of this desertion, this impotence 
 of effecting good. Alas ! how deaf and cruel man is : I could 
 more easily tear asunder his prison-walls with my hands, and 
 break with my weak fingers his iron chains, than move one, as 
 liable to suffer and to die as even his victim, to pity ! " 
 
 Elizabeth listened pale and silent to these complaints — bitter 
 as they were, they were hushed to more heart-rending silence 
 when the hour of trial came — she should only pray to die, 
 before the word that spoke his condemnation met her ea^. 
 Accustomed as a princess — a high-born and respected daughter 
 of one most powerful, to be obeyed and served -, to find herself 
 destitute of all influence, seemed to place her in another planet 
 —it was not men — not her fellow-creatures that were around 
 her ; but fiends who wore the mask of humanity. An unin- 
 habited desert had not been more solitary than this populous 
 land, whose language she possessed not ; for what is language, 
 if it reach not the heart and move it ? 
 
 Eichard, the wonder of the time, gathered courage as ill- 
 fortune pressed more hardly upon him ; in the hour of trial he 
 did not quail, but stood in bold, fearless innocence before the 
 men, whose thoughts were armed against his life. He was not 
 guilty, he said, for he could not be guilty of treason. When 
 the indictment was read which treated him as a foreigner and 
 an alien, the spirit of the Plantagenet flashed from his eyes, 
 and the very stony-hearted clerk, who read, casting his regards 
 on him, faltered and stammered, overawed by a blaze of dignity, 
 which, did we foster antique creeds, we might believe was shed 
 over him by some such spirit as imparted divine majesty to the 
 person of the king of Ithaca. Proudly and silently Eichard 
 listened to the evidence on his trial. It touched only on such 
 points as would afterwards be most material for inculpation of 
 poor Warwick. In the end he was asked what he had to 
 plead, wherefore judgment should not pass upon him — but he 
 was bid to be brief, and to beware not to use any language 
 derogatory to the high and mighty prince Henry king of 
 these realms. A smile curled his lips at this admonition, and 
 with even a playfiU air he said, ** My very good lord, I ask for

 nothing, save that a little mercy be extended to the memory of 
 my gracious uncle, my lord of Gloucester, who was no child- 
 murderer.''' 
 
 At the word he was interrupted, and sentence pronounced. 
 As the ignominious words were said, E-ichard, who from the 
 beginning had abstracted himself in prayer, so that his ears 
 might be as little wounded as possible, by an unconquerable 
 impulse put his hand where his sword might have been. Its 
 absence and the clanking of his chains recalled him to the 
 truth, and he muttered the words, " O basely murdered York ! " 
 in recollection of his unhappy grandfather, to whose miserable 
 fate he often recurred, as an example of suffering and patience. 
 
 Thus ended the bitter scene ; one he had long expected, for 
 which he had nerved himself. During nearly the whole, his 
 look was as if he were absent from it. But who could read the 
 secrets of his heart, while his impassive eyes and lips were no 
 index to the agonies that tortured it ? 
 
 CHAPTER LVII. 
 
 THE PEISON OF LUDGATE. 
 
 So young to go 
 Under the obscure, cold, rotting, wormy ground ! 
 To be nailed down into a narrow place ; 
 To see no more sweet sunshine ; hear no more 
 Blithe voice of living tiling ; muse not again 
 Upon familiar thoughts, sad, yet thus lost — 
 How fearful ! 
 
 Shellet. 
 
 " Speak to me, lady, sister, speak ! your frozen glances frighten 
 me ; your fingers, as I touch them, have no resistance or life. 
 Dearest and best, do not desert me — speak but one word, my 
 own White Eose." 
 
 Katherine raised her blue eyes heavenward : as if the effort 
 were too great, they fell again on the ground, as she said, in a 
 voice so low th^t Elizabeth could hardly catch the sound : ** I 
 must see him once again before he dies." 
 
 ** And you shall, dearest, I promise you. ' Cheer up, my love, 
 not to affright him by looks like these. Indeed you shall see 
 him, and I will also ; he shall know that he has a sister's

 prayers, a sister's love. Patience, sweet Kate, but a little 
 patience." 
 
 " Would I could sleep till then ! " replied the miserable wife t 
 and she covered her face with her hands, as if to shut out the 
 light of day, and sighed bitterly. 
 
 When our purposes are inflexible, how do insurmountable 
 obstacles break before our strong will ; so that often it seems- 
 that we are more inconstant than fortune, and that with per- 
 severance we might attain the sum of our desires. The queen, 
 the weak, despised, powerless queen, resolved to gratify this one 
 last wish of her beloved friend. Many a motive urged her to it ; 
 compassion, love, and even self-interest. At first she almost 
 despaired ; while Eichard continued in the Tower it was impos- 
 sible ; but on the twenty -third of November, two days before 
 the destined termination of his fatal tragedy, on the day of the 
 trial of poor Warwick, he was removed to the prison of Ludgate. 
 And here, at dead of night, Henry, being absent inspecting his 
 new palace at Eichmond, Elizabeth, timid, trembling, shrinking 
 now at the last — and Katherine, far too absorbed in one thought 
 to dream of fear, took boat at Westminster, and were rowed 
 along the dark, cold tide to Blackfriars. They were silent ; the 
 queen clasped her friend's hand, which was chill and deathlike. 
 Elizabeth trembled, accustomed to hope for, to seek refuge in 
 her stronger mind, she felt deserted, now that she, engrossed by 
 passion, silent and still, the wife of the near prey of death, could 
 remember only that yet for a little while he was alive. Their 
 short voyage seemed endless ; still the oars splashed, still the 
 boat glided, and yet they arrived not. Could it last for ever — 
 with one hope ever in view, never to know that he was dead 1 
 The thought passed into Katherine's mind with the sluggish but 
 absorbing tenacity of intense grief, and at last possessed it so 
 wholly, that it was with a scream of fear that she found herself 
 close \o shore. 
 
 The necessity of motion restored Katherine to her presence of 
 mind, while it deprived the queen of the little courage she pos- 
 sessed. Something was to be said and done : Elizabeth forgot 
 what ; but Katherine spoke in a clear, though unnatural voice, 
 and followed their conductors with a firm step, supporting the 
 faltering queen. Yet she addressed her not j her energies were 
 wound up to achieve one thing ; more than that it would have 
 cost her her life to attempt. They reached the dark walls of 
 the prison ; a door was unbarred, and tliey were admitted. The 
 Ijrincess passed the threshold with a quick step, as if overjoyed 
 thus to be nearer her wish. Elizabeth paused., trembled, and 
 almost wished to turn back.

 They crossed the high-walled court, and passed through 
 several dark galleries : it seemed as if they would never arrive j 
 and yet both started when they stopped at the door of a cell. . 
 
 " Does his grace expect us?" asked Katherine. 
 
 The turnkey looked as not understanding ; but their guides 
 who was the chaplain of the jail, answerd, — t 
 
 " He does not. Fearful that some impediment might inter- 
 vene, unwilling to disturb by a disappointed hope a soul so near 
 its heavenly home, I have told him nothing." 
 
 " Grently then," said Eatherine, "let our speech be low." " 
 
 The door opened, and displayed the sou of the proud, luxurious 
 Edward, sleeping on a wretched mattress, chained to the pave- 
 ment. The ladies entered alone. Katherine glided noiselessly 
 to his side ; her first act was to bend down her cheek, tiU his 
 breath disturbed the ringlet that rested on it ; thus to assure 
 herself that life was within his lips. Elizabeth fixed her earnest 
 gaze on him, to discover if in aught he reminded her of the blue- 
 eyed, flaxen-haired bridegroom of Anne Mowbray : he more re- 
 sembled a picture of her father in his early manhood ; and then 
 again her aunt the duchess of Burgundy, whom she had seen 
 just before king Edward's death. He lay there in placid sleep i 
 thought and feeling absent : yet in that form resided the soul of 
 B/ichard ; a bright casket containing a priceless gem : no flaw- 
 no token of weakness or decay. He lived — and at a word would 
 come back from oblivion to her world of love. A few days and 
 that form would still exist in all its fair proportion. But veil it 
 quick ; he is not there ; unholy and false is the philosophy that 
 teaches us that that lurid mockery was the thing we loved. 
 
 And now he woke, almost to joy; yet sadness succeeded 
 quickly to rapture. " M}'- poor girl,"^ he 'said, " weep not for 
 me ; weep for thyself rather ; a rose grafted on a thorn. The 
 degraded and disgraced claims no such sorrow." 
 
 Katherine replied by an embrace ; by laying her beautiful 
 head on his bosom, and listening with forgetful, delicious 
 ecstasy to the throbbings of his beating heart. 
 
 " Be not unjust to thyself," said a soft, unknown voice, 
 breaking the silence of the lovers ; " be not false to thy 
 house. We are a devoted race, my brother ; but we are proud 
 even to the last." 
 
 " This is a new miracle," cried the prince. " Who, except 
 this sainted one, will claim kindred with Tudor's enemy ? " 
 
 " Tudor's wife ; your sister. Do you not remember Eliza- 
 beth?" 
 
 As these words were said, Katherine, who appeard to have 
 accomplished her utmost wish, sat beside him, her arms around

 him, her sweet head reposing, her eyes closed. Kissing her soft 
 hair and fair brow, York disent wined her clasped hands, and 
 rose, addressing the trembling queen : — 
 
 " My sister," he said, " you do a deed which calls for blessings 
 from heaven upon you and yours. Till now, such, was my un- 
 manly spirit, the stigma affixed to my name, the disgrace of my 
 ignominious death, made me odious to myself. The weakness 
 of that thought is past ; the love of this sweetest sweet, and 
 your kindness restore me. Indeed, my sister, I am York — I 
 am Plantagenet." 
 
 " As such," replied the queen, " I ask a boon, for which, 
 selfish as I am, I chiefly came ; my brother will not deny me? " 
 
 *' Trifler, this is vanity. I can give nothing." 
 
 ** Oh, everything," exclaimed the lady ; " years of peace, 
 almost of happiness, in exchange for a life of bitter loneliness 
 and suffering. You, my dearest lord, know the celestial good- 
 ness of that fair "White Eose ; in adversity and peril you have 
 known it ; — I, amidst the cold deceits of a court. She has vowed 
 never to return to her native land, to bear a questioned name 
 among her peers ; or perhaps to be forced by her father to change 
 it for one abhorred. Though she must hate me as the wife of 
 her injurer, yet where can she better be than with your sister F 
 She would leave me, for I am Tudor's queen ; bid her stay with, 
 her lord's nearest kinswoman ; tell her that we will beguile the 
 long years of our too young life with talk of you ; tell her that 
 nowhere will she find one so ready to bless your name as poor 
 Elizabeth ; implore her, ah ! on ray knees do I implore you to 
 bid her not to leave me, a dead-alive, a miserable, bereft crea- 
 ture, such, as I was ere I knew her love." 
 
 fe " What say'st thou, ^weet ? " asked Richard ; " am I yet 
 monarch of that soft heart? Will my single subject obey the 
 crownless Richard ? " 
 
 Katherine stretched out her hand to the queen, who was at 
 York's feet, in token of compliance : she could not speak ; it 
 was a mighty effort to press the fingers of Elizabeth slightly ; 
 who said, — 
 
 " Before heaven and your dear lord, I claim your promise ; 
 you are mine for ever." 
 
 "A precious gift, my Bess; was it not thus my infant lips 
 called you ? I trust her to you ; and so the sting of death is 
 blunted. Yet let not too fond a lingering on one passed away, 
 tarnish the bright hours that may" yet be in store for her. Forget 
 me, sweet ones ; I am nought ; a vapour which death and dark- 
 ness inhales — iDcst unremembered. Yet while I live I would 
 ask one question — our victim-cousin, Edward of Warwick ? "

CONCLUSION. 405 
 
 Elizabeth could no longer restrain her tears as she related, that 
 however weak Warwick might heretofore have seemed, he ap- 
 peared a Plantagenet on his trial. He disdained the insulting 
 formalities of law, where the bitter Lancastrian, Lord Oxford, 
 was the interpreter of justice ; he at once declared himself 
 guilty of plotting to put the English crown on the head of his 
 cousin, the duke of York. He was quickly interrupted, and 
 condemned to be beheaded. 
 
 " Generous, unhappy Warwick. Ah ! is not life a misery, 
 when all of good, except ye two angelic creatures, die ? " 
 
 The signal was now given that the interview must end. Eliza- 
 beth wept. Katherine, still voiceless, clung closer to her hus- 
 band ; while he nerved himself to support these gentle spirits 
 with manly fortitude. One long, affectionate kiss he pressed on 
 the mouth of Katherine ; and as her roseate lips yet asked an- 
 other, another and another followed ; their lives mingled with 
 their breath. 
 
 " We meet in Paradise, mine only one," whispered York : 
 "through our Lord's mercy assuredly we meet there." 
 
 He unwound her arms ; he placed h^r in those of Elizabeth, 
 " Cherish, preserve her. Bless thee, my sist^-r ; thee, and thy 
 children. They at least will, by my death, reign rightfully over 
 this kingdom. Farewell." 
 
 He kissed her hand, and then again the lifeless hand of his 
 wife, who stood a breathing statue. She had not spoken ; no 
 words could utter her despaii*. Another moment, and their fair 
 forms were gone ; the door of his cell was closed ; and, but for 
 the presence of the God he worshipped, Richard was left alone 
 to solitude and ni^ht.

 we exist. Those who have met withoue, with ■\Those every feel-

 There was no consolation for Catherine, which could make 
 her for a moment forget that her present existence was but the 
 lees of life, the spiritless remnants of a nectareous draught. 
 But Katherine was gentle, good, and resigned ; she lived on, 
 dispensing pleasure, adored by all who approached her, and 
 gladly hailing any visitation of happiness which might reach 
 one whose affections were too fondly linked to the grave. 
 
 Years had passed since the last act of the sad tragedy which 
 destroyed her dearest hopes. She accompanied the queen of 
 England on a progress made by her, and they remained one 
 night at Eastwell Place, the seat of Sir Thomas Moyle. There 
 was a park, and stately pleasure-grounds belonging to the house, 
 undulating uplands, shady copses, and sweet running brooks to 
 diversify the scene. A crowd of the noble and the gay were 
 there, and the royal party was unusually mirthful ; fireworks, 
 masks, and dances were employed ; and ail joyously gave them- 
 selves up to the spirit of the hour. The chords of a harp, a 
 well-known air, first awoke in the bosom of the White Eose 
 that languid melancholy, so near allied to pleasure, so close a 
 neighbour to pain. By degrees memory grew busy in her brain ; 
 she could no longer endure the laughter of her companions, 
 their sallies, nay, nor their kindness ; for Elizabeth perceived 
 her dear friend's change of countenance, and was approaching, 
 when Katherine, making her a sign not to remark her, stole 
 away, and entering a straggling path, wandered on, struggling 
 with the tears, which the beauty of the evening, and the very 
 hilarity which just before she had shared, caused to gush warm 
 and fast from her eyes. 
 
 She reached a little streamlet, and was passing forward, 
 when she became aware of the presence of another in the scene. 
 A labouring man, of middle age (but his hair was grey and 
 flowed on his shoulders) was seated on the rustic masonry of a 
 rude fountain, reading ; he rose when he saw the lady, and 
 doffed his hat; she, with the cordial sweetness that accom- 
 
 the character of the Lady Katherine Gordon is a favourite of mme, and yet many 
 will be inclined to censure her abode in Heni'y the Seventh's court, and other acts 
 of her after-life. I desired therefore that she should speak for herself, and show 
 how her conduct, subsequent to lier husband's death, was in accordance vrith the 
 devotion and fidelity with which she attended his fortunes during his life.

 paniecl her slightest acts, gave him an evening benison. Her 
 voice, her look, her cordial manner moved to its depths a heart 
 lately hardened against her. As she passed on, the man followed 
 hastily, "Lady ! " he cried. 
 
 It struck the princess that this poor fellow had some request 
 to prefer to his master, and that he wished to do it through her 
 medium ; she turned with a benevolent smile : " Can I do aught 
 for you, good friend ? " 
 
 His voice failed him ; he stretched out his hand, which held 
 his book, she took it : the tiny volume was no stranger to her 
 eyes ; as if a ghost had looked on her lonely watching, she 
 trembled and grew pale, when she opened it, and saw written 
 in fair characters, by a hand now dust, " La Eosa Blanca." The 
 rustic knelt before her. 
 
 "Lady, cjueen! " he cried, " Sole relic of the unforgotten ! is 
 it thus that we meet ? " 
 
 " My cousin Edmund ! " 
 
 " Hush ! breathe not even to the silent woods the unknown 
 word. Fancy not that I am Plantagenet : for all that was of 
 worth in him you name, died when the White Rose scattered 
 its leaves upon the unworthy earth." 
 
 "Ah ! would that we had all died in that hour," cried Kathe- 
 rine : " why, when the ungrateful world lost him, did not all 
 the good and true die also, so that they might no longer 
 suffer ! " 
 
 Plantagenet cast a reproachful glance on her, as he said, 
 " Happy indeed are those who die. O God ! vrhen I think of 
 the many and the beloved, who, a few years ago, were alive 
 around me, and among whose low silent graves I now walk 
 alone, methinks I am dead; it is but the ghost of him you knew 
 that lingers upon earth." 
 
 ■ I " Yes, they are all gone," said the princess ; " all who linked 
 me to the past, and were portions of my Hichard's being. They 
 are gone from before me. But are they truly no more, or do 
 they live., like you, brooding over the lost, disdaining to com- 
 municate with one who lives but to remember them ? Of the 
 death of several I have heard ; but often I have longed with 
 bitterness to hear of you, and of the Spanish maiden, Monina 
 de Faro." 
 
 " Her gentle soul," replied Edmund; "has flown to join him 
 for whom she lived and died. It is now two years since I was 
 assured of this. A friar, whom I had formerly well known, 
 visited Lisbon ; and I entreated him to inquire for De Faro and 
 his child. The commander of the Adalid was almost forgotten ; 
 at last, an old sailor was found, who remembered that, some

 years before, lie had sailed for the Western Indies, and was 
 never heard of more." 
 
 " His daughter accompanied him?" 
 
 *' In the churchyard of a convent, placed high among the 
 foldings of those lovely hills which overlook Lisbon, he was 
 shown an humble tomb, half defaced ; her dear, sacred name is 
 carved upon it, and half the date, the 14 — , which showed that 
 she died before the century began, in which we now live.* She 
 could not have survived our prince many months ; probably she 
 died before him, nor ever knew the worst pang of all, the igno- 
 miny linked with his beloved memory." 
 
 " And you, my kinsman, how long have you wedded penury 
 and labour inthis obscure disguise?" 
 
 " Penury and labour," said Plantagenet, **are not confined to 
 the humble occupation I have adopted. I was made poor by 
 tjie death-blow of my hopes ; and my chief labour is to tame 
 my heart to resignation to the will of God. Obscure you may 
 indeed call my destination. Would I could shroud it in tenfold 
 night ! Dearer to me is the silence and loneliness of this spot, 
 where I can for ever commune undisturbed with the past, than 
 a pomp which is stained by the blood of him whom once I 
 thought we all loved so well. 
 
 " When — oh, let me name not the frightful thing ! — when he 
 was gone for ever, the \^'hole world was to me but one miserable 
 tomb. I groped in darkness, misery my mate, eternal lamenta- 
 tion my sole delight. The first thing that brought peace to my 
 soul, was the beauty of this visible universe. When God per- 
 mitted, for some inscrutable purpose, moral evil to be showered 
 so plentifully over us, he gave us a thousand resources out of 
 ourselves in compensation. If I mingled with my fellow- 
 creatures, how dearly should I miss him, who was single among 
 men for goodness, wisdom, and heaven-born nobility of soul. 
 My heart sickens at the evil things that usurp the shape of 
 humanity, and dare deem themselves of the same species : I 
 turn from all, loathing. But here there is no change, no falling- 
 ofi", no loss of beauty and of good : these glades, these copses, 
 the seasons' change and elemental ministrations, are for ever the 
 same — the type of their Maker in glory and in good. The 
 loveliness of earth saves me from despair: the Majesty of 
 Heaven imparts aspiring hope. I bare my bosom to the breeze, 
 and my wretched heart throbs less wildly. I drink in the balmy 
 sweetness of the hour, and repose again on the goodness of my 
 Creator. 
 
 " Yours is another existence, lady ; you need the adulation

 of the crowd — the h.ixury of palaces ; you purchase these, even 
 by communing with the murderer of him who deserved a dearer 
 recompense at your hands." 
 
 Katherine smiled sadly at these last words, which betrayed 
 the thought that rankled in her kinsman's mind. " I thank you," 
 she replied, " for your details. I will not blame you for the 
 false judgment you pass on me. When years and quiet thought 
 have brought you back from the tempest of emotion that shakes 
 you, you will read my heart better, and know that it is still 
 faithfully devoted to him I have lost." 
 
 " Ah ! say those words again," cried Plantagenet, " and teach 
 me to believe them. I would give my right hand to approve 
 your conduct, to love and reverence you once again." 
 
 " Will you have patience with me then, while I strive to 
 justify myself .P" 
 
 " Oh, speak ! My life, my soul's salvation, to hang upon 
 your words." 
 
 Katherine raised her blue eyes to the now starry sky, as if to 
 adjure that to be the witness of her innocent thoughts ; and then 
 she said, " We are all, dear cousin, impelled by our nature to make 
 ourselves the central point of the universe. Even those, who as 
 they fancy, sacrifice themselves for the love of God, do it more 
 truly for Tove of themselves ; and the followers of virtue too often 
 see their duties through the obscure and deceptive medium 
 which their own single, individual feelings create. Yet we have 
 one unerring guide ; one given us at our birth, and which He 
 who died on the Cross for us, taught us to understand and to 
 appreciate, commanding us to make it the master-law of our lives. 
 Call it love, charity, or sympathy ; it is the best, the angelic por- 
 tion of us. It teaches us to feel pain at others' pain, joy in their 
 joy. The more entirely we mingle our emotions with those of 
 others, making our well or ill being depend on theirs, the more 
 completely do we cast away selfishness, and approach the per- 
 fection of our nature. 
 
 " You are going to answer, perhaps to refute me — do not 
 Eemember I am a woman, with a woman's tutelage in my early 
 years, a woman's education in the world, which is that of the 
 heart — alas ! for us — not of the head. I have no school-learning, 
 no logic — but simply the voice of my own soul which speaks 
 within me. 
 
 " I try to forget ; you force me back upon myself. You 
 attack ; and you beseech me to defend myself. So to do, I 
 must dwell upon the sentiments of a heart, which is human, and 
 therefore faulty, but which has neither guile nor malice in it.

 beloved outcast, I had no difficulty in perceiving, nor — G-od was 
 so gracious to me — in fulfilling my duties. For in childhood I 
 was cherished and favoured by all ; and when I became a wife, 
 it was no wonder that I should love and idolize the most single- 
 hearted, generous, and kindly being that ever trod the earth. 
 To give myself away to him — to be a part of him — to feel that 
 we were an harmonious one in this discordant world, was a hap- 
 piness that falls to the lot of few :— defeat, chains, imprison- 
 ment — all these were but shows ; the reality was deep in our 
 hearts, invulnerable by any tyrant less remorseless than death. 
 If this life were the sum and boundary our being, I had pos- 
 sessed the consummation and fulfilment of happiness. 
 
 *' But we are taught to believe that our existence here is but 
 the stepping-stone to another beyond, and that 'death is the 
 beginning of life.' When we reach the summit of our desires, 
 then we fall, and death comes to destroy. He was lost to me, 
 my glory, and my good ! Little could I avail to him now. The 
 caresses, love, and watchful care, the obedience and the heart's 
 sacrifice, of a poor thing who groped darkling upon earth, could 
 avail nought to a spirit in Paradise. I was forced to feel that 
 I was alone : and as to me, to love is toexist ; so in that dark 
 hour, in the gaspings of my agony, I felt that I must die, if for 
 ever divided from him who possessed my affections. 
 
 " Years have passed since then. If grief kills us not, we kill 
 it. Not that I cease to grieve ; for each hour, revealing to me 
 liow excelling and matchless the being was who once was mine, 
 but renews the pang with which I deplore my alien state upon 
 earth. But such is God's will ; I am doomed to a divided 
 existence, and I submit. Meanwhile I am human ; and human 
 affections are the native, luxuriant growth of a heart whose 
 weakness it is, too eagerly and too fondly, to seek objects on 
 whom to expend its yearnings. My Ei chard's last act was to 
 bestow me on his sister : it were impious to retract a gift made 
 by thj dying. We wept together — how long, and how bitterly ! 
 — the loss of our loved one ; and then together we turned to 
 fulfil our duties. She had children ; they became as dear to me 
 as to her. Margaret I cherish as the betrothed bride of my 
 ever dear cousin, the king of Scotland ; and, when I endeavour 
 to foster the many virtues nature has implanted in the noble 
 mind of Prince Arthur, I am fulfilling, methinks, a task grateful 
 in the eyes of Hichard, thus doing my part to bestow on the 
 England he loved a sovereign who will repair the usurper's 
 crimes, and bestow happiness on the realm. 
 
 '' Nor is this all — despise me if you will, but I confess that I

 ing affection tliat forbids me to separate myself from them. Did 
 I not love the noble and good, even as he did, while E-ichard 
 lived ? Does he not now, in his heavenly abode, love them ? 
 and must my living heart be stone, because that dear form is 
 dust which was the medium of my communication with his 
 spirit ? Where I see suffering, there I must bring my mite for 
 its relief. We are not deities to bestow in impassive benevolence. 
 We give, because we love — and the meshes of that s weet web, 
 whick mutual good offices and sympathy weave, entangle and 
 enthral me, and force me to pain and pleasure, and to every 
 variety of emotion which is the portion of those whom it holds 
 withiii its folds.

 benovolent, and yet keep their hearts to themselves, the shrine 
 of worship for God, a haven which no wind can enter. I^am 
 not one of these, and yet take no shame therefore : I feel my 
 many weaknesses, and know that some of these form a part of 
 my strength ; the reviled part of our nature being a portion of 
 that which elevates us to the godlike. My reason, my sense of 
 duty, my conscientious observance of its dictates, you will set 
 up as the better part ; but I venerate also the freer impulses of 
 our souls. My passions, my susceptible imagination, my falter- 
 ing dependence on others, my clinging to the sense of joy — 
 this makes an integral part of Katheriue, nor the worst part of 
 her. When my soul quits this ' bower of flesh,' these leaves and 
 flowers, which are perhaps the growth of it, may decay and die. 
 I know not ; as it is, I am content to be an imperfect creature, 
 so that I never lose the ennobling attribute of my species, the 
 constant endeavour to be more perfect. 
 
 "I do not blame you, my cousin, for seeking repose in soli- 
 tude after much endurance. But unquiet should I feel in the 
 unreplying loneliness which forms your peace. I must love and 
 be loved. I must feel that my dear and chosen friends are 
 happier through me. When I have wandered out of myself in 
 my endeavour to shed pleasure around, I must again return 
 laden with the gathered sweets on which I feed and live. Permit 
 this to be, unblamed — permit a heart whose sufferings have been, 
 and are, so many and so bitter, to reap what joy it can from the 
 strong necessity it feels to be sympathized with — to love."
