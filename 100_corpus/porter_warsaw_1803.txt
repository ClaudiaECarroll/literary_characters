 CRITIQUES ON THIS WORK. 
 
 " Miss Porter has availed herself of a very interesting period 
 in history for the foundation of her tale. Often have we felt 
 our heart rent by indignation and pity, at the dismemberment of 
 Poland and the cruel fate of Stanislaus. Truth and fiction are 
 blended with much propriety in these Volumes ; and we have 
 turned with sincere pleasure the pages that praise the valour of 
 Kosciuszko ; and recount, though but as a novel, the adventures 
 of Sobieski," — Critical Review, Sejyt. 1803. 
 
 " Thaddeus is a work of genius, and has nothing to fear at 
 the candid bar of taste : he has to receive the precious meed of 
 sympathy from every reader of unsophisticated sentiment and 
 genuine feeling." — Imperial Review, Feb. 1804.

 DEDICATION TO THE FIRST EDITION 
 
 THADDEUS OF WARSAW 
 
 IS INSCRIBED TO 
 
 SIR SIDNEY SMITH; 
 
 IN THE HOPE THAT AS 
 
 SIR PHILIP SIDNEY 
 
 DID NOT DISDAIN TO WRITE A ROMANCE, 
 
 SIR SIDNEY SMITH 
 
 WILL NOT REFUSE TO READ ONE. 
 
 Sir Philip Sidney consigned his excellent Work, 
 
 to the Affection of a Sister. 
 
 I, confide my aspiring Attempt, to the 
 
 Urbanity of the Brave : to the Man of Taste, 
 
 of Feeling, and of Candour ; 
 
 To him, whose Friendship will bestow 
 
 That Indulgence on the Author, which his Judgment 
 
 might have denied to the Book ; 
 
 To him, of whom future Ages will speak with Honour, 
 
 and the present Times boast as their Glory ! 
 
 TO 
 
 Sir Sidney Smith, 
 
 I submit this humble Tribute of the highest Respect, 
 
 Which can be offered by a Briton,

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW, 
 
 THE 
 
 TENTH EDITION, 
 
 IS HUMBLY AND AFFECTIONATELY 
 
 INSCRIBED BY ITS AUTHOR, 
 
 TO THE MEMORY 
 OF THE LATE 
 
 GENERAL THADDEUS KOSCIUSZKO. 
 
 One view, in the original design of this 
 work, having been to draw a distinguish- 
 ing line between the spirit of patriotism, 
 and that of ambitious public disturbance ; 
 between the disinterested brave man, 
 and a military plunderer ; between true 
 glory, which arises from benefits be- 
 stowed, and the false fame which a cap- 
 
 A ^

 tain of banditti has as much right ta 
 arrogate, as the invader of kingdoms ; to 
 exhibit this radical difference between the 
 hero, and the mere soldier of fortune^ 
 the character of General Kosciuszko 
 presented itaelf as the completest exist- 
 ing exemplar for such a picture. En- 
 thusiasm supplied the pencil of adequate 
 genius. Though the written portraiture 
 be imperfectly sketched, yet its author 
 has been gratified by the sympathy of 
 readers, not only of her own country, 
 but of that of her hero. The work 
 having gone through so many editions, 
 proves that she did not aspire quite in 
 vain ; and that the principles of heroic 
 virtue, which she sought to inculcate in 
 her story of Poland, have been pro- 
 nounced by the great patriot of Poland, 
 as not unworthy his approbation, seem,N 
 now that he is removed from all earthly 
 influences, to sanction her paying that 
 tribute to his memory, which delicacy 
 forbade during his life.

 The first publication of this work, was 
 inscribed to a British hero, whose noble 
 nature well deserves the title bestowed 
 upon it by his venerable sovereign — 
 Cceiir de Lion ! He fully appreciated 
 the character of Thaddeus Kosciuszko ; 
 and the author of this sketch feels that 
 she deepens the tints of honour on each 
 name, by thus associating them togetlier. 
 May the tomb of the British hero be 
 long of finding its place ! That of Kos- 
 ciuszko has already received its sacred 
 d'^eposit ; and, with emotions far from a 
 stranger's heart, this poor offering is laid 
 x)n the grave of him who fought for 
 freedom under the banner of a patriot 
 king; who, when riches and a crown 
 were proffered to himself, declined both, 
 because no price could buy the inde- 
 pendence of an honest man ! Such was 
 General Kosciuszko ! — Such was the 
 model of disinterestedness, valour, and 
 of public virtue, which I set before me 
 in these pages ! — Such was the man who

 honoured the writer of them with his 
 esteem ; and, in that one word, she feels 
 a sufficient privilege to dedicate, with 
 humble and affectionate devotion, these 
 few inadequate pages to his memory ! — 
 Daring to catch at some memorial of 
 herself to after-times, by thus uniting to 
 the name of Thaddeus Kosciuszko, that

 PREFACE 
 
 THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS WORK. 
 
 Having attempted a work of Four 
 Volumes, it is natural that the consider- 
 ation of so much time and thought as 
 must have been spent in its execution, 
 should occasion to the Author some 
 anxiety respecting its fate ; therefore, 
 before the Reader favours the tale itself 
 with hiu attention, I beg leave to offer 
 him an account of its design. 
 
 Agreeably to the constant verdict of 
 good taste, I have ever held the novels 
 of Richardson in the greatest reverence. 
 — Their pure morality, and their unity 
 of plan, which might well entitle them 
 to be called Epic Poems in prose, have

 XIV PREFACE, 
 
 equally been the objects of my respect 
 and admiration. I see the trials and 
 triumph of Chastity manifested in the 
 person of Pamela. With the same trials 
 and triumphs, Piety, in her brightest 
 garb, is exhibited in the character of 
 Clarissa. And in Sir Charles Grandison, 
 we have a most attractive and charming 
 example of every Christian virtue. 
 
 The contemplation of such a model, 
 inspired me with emulation, while 1 
 remarked, with concern, that these good 
 novels themselves had given place on 
 the family reading-table, to light and 
 often dangerous tales, from the French 
 school, of false sentiment, and headlong 
 passion. Observing also the mistakes 
 which my young contemporaries make 
 in their estimates of character and of 
 life; how much they require that the 
 difference between certain splendid vices, 
 and the brilliant order of virtues, should 
 be distinctly marked, with perhaps a too 
 daring hand 1 here venture to sketch the 
 sacred Hne.

 PREFACE. XV 
 
 Wishing to portray a character which 
 prosperity could not inflate, nor adver- 
 sity depress, I chose Magnanimity as the 
 subject of my story. I found the original 
 of my portrait in Poland. — There is a 
 powerful ray of the Almighty in truly 
 great minds : it burns with equal splen- 
 dour in prosperity and in adversity ; its 
 purity as well as its ardour, declares its 
 divine origin. — This is the talisman of 
 those achievements, which amaze every 
 one but their accomplisher. — When the 
 eye is fixed on Heaven, «« Ossa seems a 
 wart." 
 
 What flattered Alexander into a mad- 
 man, and degraded the high-souled 
 Cagsar into a tyrant, I have selected as 
 the first ordeal of Thaddeus Sobieski. — 
 Placed at the summit of mortal ambition, 
 surrounded with greatness and glory, he 
 shows neither pride nor vanity. And 
 when, in the progress of his second trial, 
 he is plunged into the depths of sorrow ; 
 the weakness of passion never sinks the 
 dignity of his fortitude ^ neither does the

 XVI PREFACE. 
 
 firmness of that virtue blunt the amiable 
 sensibility of his heart. 
 
 This being the aim to which every in- 
 cident in the story ought to tend, it be- 
 came necessary to station my hero amidst 
 scenes, where events might probably 
 arise that were proper to excite his 
 valour and generosity, and to put his 
 moderation to the test. — Poland seemed 
 the country best calculated to promote 
 my intention. Her struggles for inde- 
 pendence, and her misfortunes, afforded 
 me situations exactly fitted to my plan : 
 — and, preferring a series of incidents, 
 which are true and interesting, before a 
 legend of war fabricated by my own hand, 
 I have made no hesitation to accept truth 
 as the helpmate of fiction. 
 
 I have now described my plan ; if 
 it be disapproved, let the Work be 
 neglected : but, should the Reader be 
 so candid as to wish to proceed, I must 
 beg him to peruse the "whole of the 
 First volume. Aware that war and 
 politics are not promising subjects of

 amusement, it is requisite to assure 
 him that he needs not to be alarmed at its 
 battles ; they are neither frequent, nor do 
 they last long : and, 1 request him, not 
 to pass over any scene as extraneous, 
 which, though it begin like a state-paper 
 or a sermon, always terminates by cast- 
 ing some new light on the portrait of the 
 hero. — As the three remaining volumes 
 are totally confined to domestic events, 
 they have none of these prejudices to 
 encounter ; but if the Reader do not ap- 
 proach them regularly through all the 
 developement of character opened in the 
 First volume, what they exhibit will seem 
 a mere wilderness of incidents, without 
 interest or end. — Indeed, I have design- 
 ed nothing in the personages of this story 
 beyond the sphere of living evidence. I 
 have sketched no virtue that I have not 
 seen, nor painted any folly from imagin- 
 ation. I have endeavoured to be as faith- 
 ful to reality in my pictures of domestic 
 morals, and of heroic life, as a just 
 painter is to the existing and engaging

 objects of nature ; and, on these grounds, 
 I have attempted steadily to inculcate, 
 *« That virtue is the highest proof of 
 understanding, and the only solid basis 
 of greatness ; and that vice is the natural 
 consequence of narrow thoughts ; which 
 begin in mistake, and end in ignominy."

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 CHAP. L 
 
 Ihe large and magnificent palace of 
 Villanow, whose vast domains stretch 
 along the northern bank of the Vistula, 
 was the favourite residence of John So- 
 bieski, King of Poland. That monarch, 
 after having delivered his country from 
 innumerable enemies, rescued Vienna, 
 and subdued the Turks, retired to this 
 place at certain seasons, and thence dis- 
 pensed those acts of his luminous and 
 benevolent mind, which rendered his 
 name great, and his people happy. 
 
 When Charles the Twelfth of Sweden 
 visited the tomb of Sobieski, at Cracow, 
 he exclaimed, <« What a pity that so great 
 a man should ever die !" Another gene- 
 ration saw the spirit of this lamented hero

 revive in the person of his descendant, 
 Constantine, Count Sobieski ; who, in a 
 comparatively private station, as Palatine 
 of Masovia, and the friend, rather than 
 the lord, of his vassals, evinced by his 
 actions, that he was the inheritor of his 
 forefather's virtue, as wxll as of his blood. 
 
 He was the first Polish nobleman, who 
 granted freedom to his peasants. He 
 threw down their mud hovels, and built 
 comfortable villages ; he furnished them 
 with seed, cattle, and implements of 
 husbandry 5 and calling their families to- 
 gether, laid before them the deed of their 
 enfranchisement : But, before he signed 
 it, he expressed a fear, that they would 
 abuse this Uberty, of which they had not 
 had experience, and become licentious. 
 
 " No ;" returned a venerable peasant, 
 " when we possessed no other property 
 than the staffs which we hold in our hands, 
 we were destitute of all worldly motive for 
 discreet conduct : not having any thing to 
 lose, we acted in too many occasions in

 an intemperate manner. But now that 
 the fruits of our labours are absolutely 
 our own, the care of protecting them will 
 be a sufficient restraint upon our actions." 
 
 The good sense and truth of this answer 
 were manifested in the event. On the 
 emancipation of these people, they be- 
 came so prosperous in business, and cor- 
 rect in behaviour, that the example of the 
 Palatine was speedily followed by several 
 of the principal nobility. The king's re- 
 form hig spirit moved in unison with that 
 of Sobieski ; and a constitution was given 
 to Poland, to place her in the first rank 
 of free nations. 
 
 Encircled by his happy tenantry, and 
 within the bosom of his family, this illus- 
 trious man educated Thaddeus, the only 
 male heir of his name, to the exercise of 
 all the virtues which ennoble and endear 
 the possessor. 
 
 But this reign of public and domestic 
 peace was not to continue. A formida- 
 ble, and apparently friendly, state, envied

 the effects of a patriotism it would not 
 imitate ; and in the beginning of the year 
 1792, regardless of existing treaties, broke 
 in upon the unguarded frontiers of Po- 
 land ; threatening, with all the horrors of 
 a merciless war, the properties, lives, and 
 liberty, of the people. 
 
 The family of Sobieski had ever been 
 foremost in the ranks of his country ; and 
 at the present crisis, its venerable head 
 did not hang behind the youngest war- 
 rior in preparations for the field. 
 
 On the evening of an anniversary of 
 the birth-day of his grandson, the Palatine 
 rode abroad with a party of friends who 
 had been celebrating the festival with 
 their presence. The Countess his daugh- 
 ter, and Thaddeus, were left alone in the 
 saloon. She sighed as she gazed on her 
 son, who stood at some distance, fitting 
 to his youthful thigh a variety of sabres, 
 which his servant, a little time before, had 
 laid upon the table. She observed with 
 anxiety the eagerness of his motion, and

 the ardour that was flashing from his 
 eyes. 
 
 " Thaddeus," said she, " lay down that 
 sword ; I wish to speak with you.^' Thad- 
 deus looked gaily up. " My dear Thad- 
 deus !" cried his mother, and tears started 
 to her eyes. The blush of enthusiasm 
 faded from his face ; he threw the sabre 
 from him, and drew near the Countess. 
 
 " Why, my dear mother, do you distress 
 yourself? When I am in battle, shall I not 
 have my grandfather near me ; and be as 
 much under, the protection of God as at 
 this moment ?" 
 
 « Yes, my child," answered she, " God 
 will protect you. He is the protector of 
 the orphan, and you are fatherless.*' 
 The Countess paused — " Here, my son," 
 said she, giving him a sealed packet, 
 ** take this : it will reveal to you the his- 
 tory of your birth, and the name of your 
 father. It is necessary that you should 
 know the truth, and all the goodness of 
 your grandfather. Thaddeus received it,

 and stood silent with surprise. Read it, 
 my love," continued she, ** but go to your 
 own apartments : here you may be inter- 
 rupted." 
 
 Bewildered by the manner of the Coun- 
 tess, Thaddeus, without answering, in- 
 stantly obeyed. Shutting himself within 
 his study, he impatiently opened the pa- 
 pers ; and soon found his whole attention 
 absorbed in the following recital. 
 
 To my dear Son^ Thaddeus Constantine 
 SobieskL — 
 
 " You are now, my Thaddeus ! at the 
 early age of nineteen, going to engage 
 the enemies of your country. Ere I re- 
 sign my greatest comfort to the casualties 
 of war, ere I part with you, perhaps for 
 ever, I would inform you, who your fa- 
 ther really was : that father whose exist- 
 ence you have hardly known ; and whose 
 name you have never heard. You be- 
 lieve yourself an orphan ; your mother a 
 widow: but, alas! I have now to tell

 you, that you were made fatherless by 
 the cruelty of man, not by the dispens- 
 ation of heaven, 
 
 ** Twenty years ago I accompanied 
 my father in a tour through Germany 
 into Italy, Grief for the death of my 
 mother had impaired his health ^ and 
 the physicians ordered him to reside in 
 a warmer climate : accordingly we fixed 
 ourselves near the Arno. During several 
 visits to Florence, my father met, in that 
 city, witii a young Englishman of the 
 name of Sackville. These frequent meet- 
 ings opened into intimacy, and he was 
 invited to our house. 
 
 " Mr. Sackville was not only the hand- 
 somest man I had ever beheld, but the 
 most accomplished ; and his heart seemed 
 the seat of every graceful feeling. He 
 was the first man for whose society I 
 found a lively preference. I used to smile 
 at this strange delight, or sometimes 
 weep : for the emotions which agitated me 
 were undefinable : but they were enchant-

 ing; and unheedingly I gave them in- 
 dulgence. The hours which we passed 
 together in the interchange of reciprocal 
 sentiments; the kind beaming of his looks; 
 the thousand sighs that he breathed; the 
 half-uttered sentences ; all conspired to 
 rob me of myself. 
 
 " Eight months were spent in these 
 delusions. — During the last three, doubts 
 and anguish displaced the blissful reveries 
 of an infant tenderness. The attentions of 
 Mr. Sackville died away. From being the 
 object of his constant search, he now se- 
 dulously sought to avoid me. When my 
 father withdrew to his closet, he would 
 take his leave, and allow me to walk alone. 
 Solitary and wretched were my rambles. 
 I had full leisure to compare my then dis- 
 turbed state of mind, with the comparative 
 peace I had enjoyed in my own country. 
 Immured within the palace of Villanow, 
 watching the declining health of my mo- 
 ther, I knew nothing of the real world ; 
 the little I had learnt of society, being 
 drawn from books, and uncorrected by ex-

 perience, I was taught to believe a perfec- 
 tion in man, which to my affliction, I since 
 found to be but a poet's dream. When I 
 came to Italy, I continued averse to public 
 company. In such seclusion, the presence 
 of Sackville being almost my only plea^ 
 sure, chased from my mind its usual re- 
 serve ; and gradually, and surely, won 
 upon the awakened afiections of my heart. 
 Artless and unwarned, I knew not the 
 nature of the passion which I cherished, 
 until it had gained an ascendency that 
 menaced my life. 
 
 ** On the evening of one of those days 
 in which I had not seen this too dearly- 
 beloved friend, I strolled out, and hardly 
 conscious of my actions, threw myself 
 along the summit of a flight of steps that 
 led down to the Arno. My head rested 
 against the base of a statue, which, be- 
 cause of its resemblance to me, Sackville 
 had presented to my father. Every re- 
 collected kindness of his now gave me 
 additional torment ; and, clinging to the

 pedestal, as to the altar of my adoration, 
 in the bitterness of disappointment, I ad- 
 dressed the insensible stone ; ' O ! were 
 I pale as thou art, and this breast as cold 
 and still, would Sackville, when he looked 
 on me, give one sigh to the creature he 
 had destroyed ?' My sobs followed this 
 adjuration, and the next moment I felt 
 myself encircled in his arms. I struggled, 
 and, almost fainting, begged to be re- 
 leased. He did release me, and, falling 
 on his knees, implored my pardon for the 
 misery which I had endured. * Now, 
 Therese,* cried he, * all is as it ought to 
 be ! you are my only hope. Consent to 
 be mine, or the world has no hold on 
 me !' His voice was hurried and incohe- 
 rent. Raising my eyes to his, I beheld 
 
 them wild and bloodshot. Terrified at his 
 look, and overcome by my own emotions, 
 my head sunk on the marble. With in- 
 creased violence, he exclaimed, * Have I 
 deceived myself here too ? Therese, did 
 you not prefer me ? Did you not love me ? 
 — Speak now, I conjure you, by your

 own happiness and mine ! Do you reject 
 me ?' He clenched my hands with a force 
 that made me tremble, and I hardly arti- 
 culated, * I will be yours/ At these 
 words he hurried me down a dark vista, 
 which led out of the gardens to the 
 open country. A carriage stood at the 
 gate. I fearfully asked what he intended. 
 * You have given yourself to me,' cried 
 he, ' and by the Great Lord of Heaven, 
 no power shall separate us until you are 
 mine beyond the reach of man !' Un- 
 nerved in body, and weak in mind, I 
 yielded to his impetuosity ; and, suffering 
 him to lift me into the chariot, was carried 
 to the door of the nearest monastery, 
 where in a few minutes we were married, 
 " I am thus particular in the relation 
 of every incident, in the hope that you 
 will, my dear son, see some excuse for 
 my great imprudence, — in the circum- 
 stances of my youth ; and in the influ- 
 ence, which a man who seemed all ex- 
 cellence, had over my heart. However, 
 my fault went not long unpunished.

 " The ceremony passed, my husband 
 conducted me in silence back to the car- 
 riage. My full bosom discharged itself in 
 abundance of tears, while Sackville sat by 
 me, unmoved and mute. Two or three 
 times I raised my eyes, in hopes of dis- 
 cerning in his, some consolation for my 
 hasty acquiescence. But no j his gaze, 
 vacant and glaring, was fixed on the win- 
 dow ; and his brow scowled, as if he had 
 been forced into an alliance with one he 
 hated, rather than had just made a volun- 
 tary engagement with the woman he 
 loved. My soul shuddered at this com- 
 mencement of a contract which I had 
 dared to make unsanctioned by my fa- 
 ther's consent. At length my sighs 
 seemed to startle my husband ; and, turn- 
 ing suddenly round, * Therese,' cried 
 he, 'this marriage must not be told to 
 
 the Palatine.' 1 demanded a reason 
 
 for so unexpected a prohibition. * Be- 
 cause I have been precipitate. It would 
 ruin me with my family. Wait, only for 
 one month j and then I will publicly ac-

 knowledge you/ The agitation of his 
 features, the sternness of his voice, and 
 the feverish burning of his hand, which 
 held mine, alarmed me. Trembling from 
 head to foot, I answered, * Sackville ! I 
 have already erred enough in consenting 
 to this stolen union. I will not transgress 
 further, by concealing it. I will in- 
 stantly throw myself at my father's feet, 
 and confess all.' His countenance dark- 
 ened. * Therese,' said he, ' I am your 
 husband. You have sworn to obey me, 
 and I command your silence. Till I 
 allow you, divulge this marriage at your 
 peril.' This last cruel sentence, and the 
 more cruel look that accompained it, 
 pierced me to the heart, and I fell sense- 
 less on the seat. 
 
 " When I recovered, I found myself at 
 the foot of that statue, beneath which my 
 unfortunate destiny had been fixed. My 
 husband was leaning over me. He raised 
 me with tenderness from the ground ; and 
 conjured me, in the mildest accents, to be 
 comforted ; to pardon the severity of those

 words which had arisen from a fear that, 
 by an imprudent avowal on my part, I 
 should risk both his happiness and my 
 own. He informed me, that he was heir 
 to one of the first fortunes in England ; 
 he had pledged his honour with his fa- 
 ther never to enter into any matrimonial 
 engagement, without first acquainting 
 him with the particulars of the lady and 
 her family. Should he omit this duty, his 
 father declared, that though she were a 
 princess, he would disinherit him, and 
 never again admit him to his presence. 
 
 " ' Consider this, my dear Therese,' 
 continued he ; * could you endure to be- 
 hold me a beggar, and stigmatized with 
 a parent's curse, when a little forbearance 
 on your part would make all right ? I 
 know I have been hasty in acting as I 
 have done, but now I cannot remedy my 
 error. To-morrow I will write to my 
 father, describe your rank and merits, 
 and request his consent to our immediate 
 marriage. The moment his permission

 arrives, I will cast myself on the Palatine's 
 friendship, and reveal what has passed.' 
 The tenderness of my husband blinded 
 my reason ; and with many tears, I sealed 
 his forgiveness, and pledged my faith on 
 his word. 
 
 " My dear deceived parent little sus- 
 pected the perfidy of his guest. He de- 
 tained him as his visitor : and often ral- 
 lied himself, on the hold which his distin- 
 guished accomplishments had taken on 
 his esteem. Sackville's manner to me in 
 public was obliging and free ; it was in 
 private only, that I found the tender, 
 the capricious, the, unfeeling husband. 
 Night after night I have washed the me- 
 mory of my want of duty to my father, 
 with bitter tears : but my husband was 
 dear to me, was more precious than my 
 life : one kind look from him, one fond 
 word, would solace every pain, and make 
 me w^ait the arrival of his father's letter 
 with all the gay anticipations of youth 
 and love.

 " A fortnight passed away. A montli, 
 a long and lingering month. Another 
 month, and a packet of letters was pre- 
 sented to Sackville. He was at breakfast 
 with us. At sight of the superscription, he 
 coloured, tore open the paper, ran his eyes 
 over a few lines, and then, pale and trem- 
 bling, rose from his seat, and left the 
 room. My emotions were almost uncon- 
 trollable. I had already half risen from 
 my chair to follow him, when the Palatine 
 exclaimed, < What can be in that letter ? 
 Too plainly I see some afflicting tidings.' 
 And without observing me, or waiting for 
 a reply, he hurried out after him. I stole 
 to my chamber, where, throwing myself 
 on my bed, I tried, by all the delusions 
 of hope to obtain some alleviation from 
 the pangs of suspense. 
 
 " The dinner bell roused me from my 
 reverie. Dreading to excite suspicion, and 
 anxious to read in the countenance of my 
 husband the denunciation of our fate, I 
 obeyed the summons, and descended to 
 the dining-room. On entering it, my eyes

 irresistibly wandered round to fix them- 
 selves on Sackville. He was leaning 
 against a pillar, his face pale as death. 
 My father looked grave, but immediately 
 took his seat, and tenderly placed his 
 friend beside him. 1 sat down in silence. 
 Little dinner was eaten, and few words 
 spoken. — As for myself, my agitations 
 almost choked me. I felt that the first 
 word I should attempt to pronounce, 
 must give them utterance, and that their 
 vehemence would betray our fatal secret. 
 <* When the servants withdrew, Sack- 
 ville rose, and taking my father's hand, 
 said, in a faultering voice, ' Count, I must 
 leave you.' — * It is a wet evening,' re- 
 plied the Palatine ; * you are unwell — 
 disturbed — stay till tOrmorrow !' — * I 
 thank your Excellency,' answered he, 
 * but I must go to Florence to-night. You 
 shall see me again before to morrow after- 
 noon : all will then, I hope, be settled to 
 my wish.' Sackville took his hat. Mo- 
 tionless, and incapable of speaking, I sat

 fixed to my chair, in the direct way that 
 he must pass. His eye met mine. He 
 stoppedj and looked at me, abruptly 
 caught my hand ; then as abruptly quit- 
 ting it, darted out of the room. I never 
 saw him more. 
 
 " I had not the power to dissemble 
 another moment. I fell back, weeping, 
 into the arms of my father. He did not, 
 even by this imprudence, read what I 
 almost wished him to guess ; but with all 
 the indulgence of perfect confidence, 
 lamented the distress of Sackville, and 
 the sensibility of my nature, which sympa- 
 thized so painfully with his friend. I durst 
 not ask what was the distress of his friend j 
 abashed at my duplicity to him, and over- 
 whelmed with a thousand dreads, I obtain- 
 ed his permission to retire to my chamber. 
 
 *' The next day, I met him with a se- 
 rene air ; for I had schooled my heart to 
 endure the sufferings it had deserved. The 
 Palatine did not remark my recovered 
 tranquillity J neither did he appear to

 think any more of my tears ; so entirely 
 was he occupied in conjecturing the cause 
 of Sackville's grief; who had acknow- 
 ledged having received a great shock, but 
 would not reveal the occasion. This ig- 
 norance of my father surprised me ; and 
 to all his suppositions I said little. My 
 soul was too deeply interested in the sub- 
 ject, to trust to the faithfulness of my lips. 
 
 " The morning crept slowly on, and the 
 noon appeared to stand still. I anxiously 
 watched the declining sun, as the signal 
 for mv husband's return. Two hours had 
 elapsed since his promised time, and my 
 father grew so impatient, that he went out 
 to meet him. I eagerly wished that they 
 might miss each other. I should then see 
 SackviUe a few minutes alone ; and by one 
 word, be comforted, or driven to despair. 
 
 " I was listening to every footstep that 
 sounded under the colonnade, when my 
 servant brought me a letter which had just 
 been left by one of Mr. Sackville's grooms.

 contents — " 
 
 Thaddeus, with a burning cheek, and a 
 heart all at once robbed of that elastic 
 spring, which till now had ever made him 
 the happiest of the happy, took up the 
 letter of his father. The paper was worn 
 and blistered with his mother's tears. 
 His head seemed to swim as he contem- 
 plated the hand-writing, and he said to 
 himself, " Am I to respect or to abhor 
 him ?" He proceeded in the perusal. 
 
 " To Therese^ Couiitess SoUeski,

 But an attempt at palliating my conduct, 
 would be to no purpose ; indeed it is im- 
 possible. You cannot conceive a viler 
 opinion of me, than I have of myself. I 
 know that I forfeit all claim to honour j 
 that I have sacrificed your tenderness to 
 my distracted passions : But you shall no 
 more be subject to the caprices of a man, 
 who cannot repay your love with his own.

 you possess virtues which will render you 
 tranquil under every calamity. I leave 
 you to your own innocence. Forget the 
 ceremony which has passed between us : 
 my wretched heart disclaims it for ever. 
 Your father is happily ignorant of it; 
 pray spare him the anguish of knowing 
 that I was so completely unworthy of his 
 kindness ; I feel that I am more than 
 ungrateful to you and to him. Therese, 
 your most inveterate hate cannot more 
 strongly tell me, than I tell myself, that I 
 have treated you like a villain. But I 
 cannot retract. I am going where all 
 search will be vain ; and I now bid you 
 an eternal farewell. May you be happier 
 than ever can be the wretched, self-

 Thaddeus went on with his mother's 
 narrative.

 on the ground, holding the half-perused 
 paper in my hand. Grief and horror 
 locked up the avenues of complaint, and I

 sat as one petrified to stone. My father 
 entered. At the sight of me, he started as 
 if he had seen a spectre. His well-known 
 features opened at once my agonized 
 heart. With fearful cries, I cast myself at 
 his feet, and putting the letter into his 
 hand, clung, almost expiring, to his knees. 
 " When he had read it, he flung it from 
 him, and dropping into a chair, covered 
 his face with his hands. I looked up im- 
 ploringly, for I could not speak. My 
 father stooped forward, and raising me in 
 his arms pressed me to his bosom. * My 
 Therese,' said he, ' it is I who have done 
 this. Had I not harboured this villain, he 
 never could have had an opportunity of 
 ruining the peace of my child.' In return, 
 for the unexampled indulgence of this 
 speech ; and his repeated assurances of 
 forgiveness ; I promised to forget a man, 
 who could have so little respect for grati- 
 tude, or his own honour. The Palatine re- 
 plied, that he expected such a resolution, 
 in consequence of the principles which he 
 had taught me j and to show me how far

 dearer to him was my real tranquillity than 
 any false idea of impossible restitution, he 
 would not remove, even from one princi- 
 pality to another, were he sure by that 
 means, to discover Mr. Sackville, and to 
 avenge my wrongs. My understanding 
 assented to the justice of all his reasoning; 
 but long and severe were the struggles, 
 before I could erase from my soul, the 
 image of that being wlio had been the 
 lord of all its joys and sorrows. 
 
 " It was not until you, my dear Thad- 
 deus, were born, that I could repay the 
 goodness of my father with the smiles of 
 cheerfulness. — He would not permit me 
 to give you any name, which could remind 
 him, or myselfi of the cruel parent who 
 gave you being ; and by his desire I chris- 
 tened you Thaddeus Constantine, after 
 himself, and his best-beloved friend Ge- 
 neral Kosciuszko. — You have not yet seen 
 that illustrious Polander, whose prescient 
 watchfulness for his coiuitry has always 
 kept him on the frontiers. He is now with

 Sobieski. In him, you may study one 
 of the brightest models of patriotic and 
 martial virtue, that ever was presented to 
 mankind. It may well be said of him, — 
 * That he would have shone with dis- 
 tinguished lustre in the ages of chivalry.' 
 Gallant, generous, and strictly just ; he 
 commands obedience by the reverence in 
 which he is held ; and attaches the troops 
 to his person, by the affability of his man- 
 ners, and the purity of his life. He teaches 
 them discipline, endurance of fatigue, 
 and contempt of danger, by his dauntless 
 example : and inspires them with confi- 
 dence, by his tranquillity in the tumult of 
 action, and the invincible fortitude with 
 which he meets the most adverse strokes 
 of misfortune. His modesty in victory, 
 shows him to be one of the greatest among 
 men ; and his magnanimity under defeat, 
 confirms him to be little less than a god.

 bear : How bitterly do I lament that the

 one, to which nature gave you a claim, 
 was so unworthy to be united with it, 
 and that of my no less heroic father ! — 
 
 " On our return to Poland, the story 
 which the Palatine related, when ques- 
 tioned about my apparently forlorn state, 
 was simply this; — "My daughter was 
 married, and widowed in the course of 
 two months. — Since then, to root from 
 her memory, as much as possible, all 
 recollection of a husband who was only 
 given to be taken away, she still retains 
 my name ; and her son, as my sole heir, 
 shall bear no other," This reply satisfied 
 every one : the King, who was my father's 
 only confidant, gave his sanction to it, 
 and no further enquiries were started. 
 
 ** You are now, my beloved child, en- 
 tering on the eventful career of life. God 
 only knows when the venerable head of

 your youth, my Thaddeus, with the draught 
 that has poisoned mine ; not to implant 
 in your breast, hatred of a parent whom 
 you may never behold, have I written 
 this : but to inform you in fact from 
 whom you sprung. My history is made 
 plain to you, that no unexpected events 
 may hereafter perplex your opinion of 
 your mother ; or cause a blush to rise on 
 that cheek for her, v/hich from your 
 grandfather can derive no stain. For his 
 sake as well as for mine, whether in 
 peace or in war, may the angels of 
 Heaven guard my boy ! This is the

 ' When he finished reading, Thaddeus 
 held the papers in his hand ; but unable 
 to recover from the shock of their con- 
 tents, he read them a second time to the 
 end: then laying them on the table, 
 against which he rested his now aching 
 head, he gave vent to the fulness of his 
 heart. 
 
 The Countess, anxious for the effect 
 which her history might have on her son, 
 at this instant entered the room. Seeing 
 him in so dejected an attitude, she ap- 
 proached, and pressing him to her bosom 
 mingled her tears with his. Thaddeus, 
 ashamed of his emotions, yet incapable 
 of dissembling them, struggled a few 
 moments to release himself from her 
 arms. The Countess, mistaking his mo- 
 tive, said in a melancholy voice, " And 
 do you, my son, despise your mother for 
 the weakness which she has revealed ? Is 
 this the reception that I expected from a 
 child, on whose affection I reposed ray 
 confidence and my comfort ?"

 " No, my mother/' replied Thaddeus ; 
 " it is your afflictions which have dis- 
 tressed me. This is the first unhappy 
 hour I ever knew, and can you wonder 
 I should be affected ? Oh ! mother," con- 
 tinued he, laying his hand on his father's 
 letter, " whatever were his rank, had my 
 father been but noble in mind, I would 
 have gloried in bearing his name; but 
 now, I put up my prayers never to hear 
 it more." 
 
 "'Forget him," cried the Countess, 
 hiding her eyes with her handkerchief. 
 
 " I will !" answered Thaddeus, " and 
 allow my memory, to dwell only on the 
 virtues of my mother." 
 
 It was impossible for the Countess or 
 her son, to conceal their agitation from 
 the Palatine, who now opened the door. 
 On his expressing alarm at a sight so 
 unusual, his daughter finding herself in- 
 capable of speaking, put into his hand 
 the letter which Thaddeus had just read. 
 Sobieski cast his eye over the first lines ;

 he comprehended their tendency, and 
 seeing the Countess had withdrawn, he 
 looked towards his grandson. Thaddeus 
 was walking up and down the roonj, 
 striving to command himself for the con- 
 versation he anticipated with his grand- 
 father. 
 
 " I am sorry, Thaddeus," said Sobieski, 
 " that your mother has so abruptly im- 
 parted to you the real name and cha- 
 racter of your father. I see that his 
 villany has distressed a heart, which 
 heaven has made alive to the slightest 
 dishonour. But be consoled, my son ! I 
 have prevented the publicity of his con- 
 duct, by an ambiguous story of your 
 mother's widowhood. Notwithstanding 
 this arrangement, she judged it proper^ 
 that you should not enter general society 
 without being made acquainted with the 
 true events of your birth. I believe 
 my daughter is right. But cheer your- 
 self, my child! you will imbitter the 
 remainder of my days, if you suffer the

 " No, my lord," answered his grand- 
 son ; *' you have been more than a parent 
 to me j and henceforward, for your sake 
 as well as my own, I shall hold it my 
 duty, to forget that I drew my being 
 from any other source than that of the 
 house of Sobieski." 
 
 " You are right," cried the Palatine, 
 with an exulting emotion, ** you have the 
 spirit of your ancestors ; and I shall live 
 to see you add glory to the name !" 
 
 The beaming eyes and smiling lips of 
 the young Count, declared that he had 
 shaken sorrow from his heart. His grand- 
 father pressed his hand with delight; 
 and saw in his recovered serenity the 
 sure promise of his fond prophecy.

 The fearful day arrived, when Sobieski 
 and his grandson were to bid adieu to 
 Villanow and its peaceful scenes. 
 
 The well-poised mind of the veteran, 
 bade his daughter farewell, with a forti- 
 tude which imparted some of its strength 
 even to her. But when Thaddeus, ready 
 habited for his journey, entered the room, 
 at the sight of his military accoutre- 
 ments she shuddered ; and when, with a 
 glowing countenance, he advanced smil- 
 ing through his tears, towards her, she 
 clasped him in her arms ; and ri vetted her 
 lips to that face, the very loveliness of 
 which, added to her affliction. She gazed 
 at him, she wept on his neck, she pressed 
 him to her bosom. <* O ! how soon might 
 all that beauty be mingled with the dust !

 how soon might that warm heart, which 
 then beat against hers, be pierced by the 
 sword! be laid on the ground, mangled 
 and bleeding, exposed, and trampled on !'* 
 These thoughts thronged upon her soul, 
 and deprived her of sense. She was car- 
 ried away lifeless by her maids, while the 
 Palatine compelled Thaddeus to quit the 
 spot. 
 
 It was not until the lofty battlements of 
 Villanow blended with the clouds, that 
 Thaddeus could throw off his melancholy. 
 The parting agony of his mother hung on 
 his spirits ; and heavy and frequent were 
 his sighs; as he gazed on the rustic cottages 
 and fertile fields, which reminded him that 
 he was yet passing through the territories 
 of his grandfather. The picturesque mill 
 of Mariemont was the last spot on which 
 his sight lingered. The ivy that mantled 
 its sides, sparkled with the brightness of 
 a shower which had just fallen : and the 
 rays of the setting sun, gleaming on its 
 shattered wall, made it an object of such

 romantic beauty, that he could not help 
 pointing it out to his fellow-travellers. 
 
 Whilst the eyes of General Butzou, who 
 was in the carriage, followed the direction 
 of Thaddeus, the Palatine observed the 
 heightening animation of his features ; and 
 recollecting at the same time, the trans- 
 ports which he himself had enjoyed, when 
 he visited that place one- and- twenty 
 years ago, he put his hand on the shoulder 
 of the veteran, and exclaimed, " General, 
 did you ever relate to my boy the par- 
 ticulars of that mill ?" 
 
 "No, my Lord." 
 
 ** I suppose,'* continued the Palatine, 
 ** the same reason deterred you from 
 speaking of it uncalled for, as lessened 
 my wish to tell the story ? We are both 
 too much the heroes of the tale, to have 
 volunteered the recital." 
 
 ** Does your Excellency mean," asked 
 Thaddeus, " the rescue of our King from 
 this place?" 
 
 ** I do."

 " I have a very indistinct knowledge 
 of the affair. I remember that it was told 
 me many years ago ; but I have almost 
 forgotten it ; and can only account for 
 my apparent insensibility in never having 
 enquired further, by pleading the happy 
 thoughtlessness in which you have hither- 
 to permitted me to live.'* 
 
 ** But/' said the Palatine, whose object 
 was to draw his grandson from melan- 
 choly reflections ; " what will you say 
 to me turning egotist ?" 
 
 " I now ask the story of you," returned 
 Thaddeus, smiling ; " besides, as soldiers 
 are permitted by the fire-side to ^Jight 
 their battles o'er again f your modesty, 
 my dear grandfather, cannot object to re- 
 peat it to me on the way to more." 
 
 " As a preliminary," said the Palatine, 
 " I must suppose it is unnecessary to tell 
 you, that General Butzou was the brave 
 soldier who, at the imminent risk of his 
 life, saved our sovereign." 
 
 " Of course, I know that," replied the

 young Count ; " and that you, too, had 
 a share in the honour; for when I was 
 yesterday presented to His Majesty, 
 amongst other things which he said, he 
 told me, that he beheved, under heaven, 
 he owed his present existence to General 
 Butzou and yourself." 
 ^ " So very little to me," resumed So- 
 bieski, " that I will, to the best of my 
 recollection, repeat every circumstance 
 of the affair. Should I err, I must beg of 
 you. General," turning to the veteran, 
 ** to put me right ." 
 
 Butzou, with a glow of honest exulta- 
 tion still painting his face, nodded assent ; 
 and Thaddeus bowing in sign of atten- 
 tion, the Palatine began. 
 
 " It was on a Sunday night, the third of 
 September, in the year 1771> that this event 
 took place. At that time, instigated by the 
 courts of Vienna and Constantinople, a 
 band of disloyal and confederate Lords of 
 Poland were laying waste their country, 
 and perpetrating all kinds of outrage on

 their fellow subjects who adhered to the 
 King. 
 
 " Amongst their numerous crimes, a 
 plan was laid for surprising, and taking 
 the royal person. Pulaski was one of the 
 most daring of their leaders ; and assisted 
 by Lukawski, Strawenski, and Kosinski, 
 three Poles of distinction, he resolved to 
 accomplish this design or perish. Ac- 
 cordingly, the three latter, in obedience 
 to his orders, with forty other conspira- 
 tors, met at Czetschokow, and in the 
 presence of their commander, swore with 
 the most horrid oaths, to deliver Stanislaus 
 alive or dead into his hands. 
 
 " About a month after this meeting, 
 these noblemen, at the head of a band of 
 assassins, disguised themselves as pea- 
 sants ; and concealing their arms in wag- 
 gons of hay, which they drove before 
 them, they entered Warsaw unsuspected.

 scheme. They placed themselves under 
 cover of the night in those avenues of the 
 city through which they knew His Ma- 
 jesty must pass in his way from Villanow, 
 where he had been dining with me. His 
 carriage was escorted by four of his own 
 attendants, myself and twelve of my 
 guards. We had scarcely lost sight of 
 Villanow when the conspirators rushed 
 out and surrounded us, commanding the 
 coachmen to stop, and beating down the 
 men, with the butt end of their musquets. 
 Several shot were fired into the coach. 
 One passed through my hat, as I was get- 
 ting out sword in hand, the better to re- 
 pel an attack the motive of which 1 could 
 not divine. A cut across my right leg 
 with a sabre laid me under the wheels ; 
 and whilst in that situation, I heard the 
 shot pouring into the coach like hail, and 
 felt the villains stepping over my body to 
 finish the murder of the King. 
 
 ** It was then that our friend Butzou 
 (who at that period was a private soldier

 in my service) stood between his sovereign 
 and the rebels. In one instant he received 
 several balls through his limbs, and a 
 thrust from a bayonet in his breast, which 
 cast him weltering in his blood upon me. 
 By this time all the persons who had 
 formed the escort, were either wounded or 
 dispersed. Secure of their prey, one of 
 the assassins opened the carriage door, 
 and with shocking imprecations, seizing 
 the King by the hair, discharged liis pistol 
 so near His Majesty's face, that he felt 
 the heat of the flash. A second villain cut 
 him on the forehead with a sword ; whilst 
 a third, who was on horseback, laying hold 
 of his collar, dragged him along the 
 ground through the suburbs of the city. 
 
 " During the latter part of this outra- 
 geous scene, some of our frighted people 
 returned with a detachment, and seeing 
 Butzou and me apparently lifeless, carried 
 us to the royal palace, where all was com- 
 motion and distraction. The foot guards 
 followed the track which the conspirators 
 had taken. In one of the streets they

 found the King's hat dyed in blood, and 
 his peUsse perfectly reticulated with bul- 
 let holes. This confirmed their apprehen- 
 sions of his death ; and they came back, 
 filling all Warsaw with dismay. 
 
 *' The assassins, meanwhile, got clear 
 of the town. Finding, however, that the 
 King, by loss of blood, was not Ukely to 
 exist much longer, if they continued their 
 manner of dragging him towards their em- 
 ployer ; and that delay might even lose 
 them his dead body ; they mounted him, 
 and redoubled their speed. When they 
 came to the moat which surrounds War- 
 saw, they compelled him to leap his horse 
 across it. In the attempt, the horse fell, 
 and broke its leg. They then ordered 
 His Majesty, fainting as he was, to mount 
 another and spur it over. The conspi- 
 rators had no sooner passed the ditch, and 
 saw their king fall insensible on the neck 
 of his horse, than they tore from his breast 
 the ribbon of the black eagle, and its dia- 
 mond cross. Lukawski was so foolishly 
 sure of his prisoner, dead or alive, that

 he quitted his charge, and repaired with 
 these spoils to Pulaski : meaning to show 
 them as proofs of his success. Many of 
 the other plunderers, concluding that 
 they could not do better than follow their 
 leader's example, fled also ; and left only 
 seven of the party, with Kosinski at their 
 head, to remain over the unfortunate 
 Stanislaus, who shortly after recovered 
 from his swoon. 
 
 " The night was now grown so dark, 
 they could not be sure of their way ; and 
 their horses stumbling at every step over 
 stumps of trees and hollows in the earth, 
 increased their apprehensions to such a 
 degree, that they obliged the King to 
 keep up with them on foot. He literally 
 marked his path with his blood j his shoes 
 having been torn off in the struggle at the 
 carriage. Thus they continued wander- 
 ing backwards and forwards, and round 
 the outskirts of Warsaw, without any ex- 
 act knowledge of their situation. The 
 men who guarded him, at last became so 
 afraid of their prisoner's taking advantage

 of these circumstances to escape, that 
 they repeatedly called on Kosinski for 
 orders to put him to death. Kosinski re- 
 fused y but their demands growing more 
 imperious, as the intricacies of the forest 
 involved them completely, the King ex- 
 pected every moment to find their bayo- 
 nets in his breast. 
 
 <' When I recovered from my swoon, 
 my leg was bound up, and I was able to 
 stir. Questioning the officers who stood 
 about my couch, I found that a general 
 panic had seized them. They knew not 
 how to proceed ; they shuddered at leav- 
 ing the King to the mercy of the confe- 
 derates ; and yet were fearful by pursuing 
 him farther to incense them through ter- 
 ror or revenge to massacre their prisoner, 
 if he were still alive. I did all that was 
 in my power to dispel this last dread. 
 Anxious at any rate to make another 
 attempt to preserve him, though I could 
 not ride myself, I strenuously advised an 
 immediate pursuit on horseback ; and in* 
 sisted that neither darkness nor danger

 should be permitted to impede their 
 course. Recovered presence of mind in 
 the nobles restored hope and animation to 
 the terrified soldiers ; and my orders were 
 obeyed. But I must add, they were 
 soon disappointed : for in less than half 
 an hour the detachment returned in des- 
 pair, showing me His Majesty's coat, 
 which they had found in the fosse. I 
 suppose the ruffians tore it off when they 
 rifled him. It was rent in several places, 
 and so wet with blood, that the officer 
 who presented it to me thought they had 
 murdered the King there, and had drawn 
 away his body ; for by the light of the 
 torches, the soldiers could trace drops of 
 blood to a considerable distance. 
 
 " Whilst I was attempting to invalidate 
 this new evidence of His Majesty's being 
 beyond the reach of succour or of insult, 
 he was driven before the seven conspi- 
 rators so far into the wood of Bielany that 
 not knowing whither they went, they 
 came up with one of the guard-houses, 
 and to their extreme terror were accosted

 by a patrole. Four of the banditti imme- 
 diately disappeared, leaving two only with 
 Kosinski ; who, much alarmed, forced his 
 prisoner to walk faster and keep a pro- 
 found silence. Notwithstanding all this 
 precaution, scarce a quarter of an hour 
 afterwards, they were challenged by a 
 second watch ; and the other two men 
 taking to flight, Kosinski, full of dismay, 
 was left alon e with the Xing. His Maj esty, 
 sinking with pain and fatigue, beseeched 
 permission to rest for a moment; but 
 Kosinski refused, and pointing his sword 
 towards the King, compelled him to 
 proceed. 
 
 " As they walked on, the unfortunate 
 Stanislaus, who was hardly able to drag 
 one limb after the other, observed that 
 his conductor gradually forgot his vigi- 
 lance, until he was thoroughly given up 
 to thought. The King conceived some 
 hope from this change, and ventured to 
 say, * I see, that you know not how to pro- 
 ceed. You cannot but be aware that the 
 enterprise in which you are engaged, how*

 ever it may end, is full of peril to you. 
 Successful conspirators are always jealous 
 of each other : Pulaski will find it as easy 
 to rid himself of your life, as it is to take 
 mine. Avoid that danger ; and I will pro- 
 mise you none on my account. Suffer me 
 to enter the convent of Bielany ; we can- 
 not be far from it ; and then, do you pro- 
 vide for your own safety.' Kosinski, 
 rendered desperate by the circumstances 
 in which he was involved, replied, * No ; 
 I have sworn ; and I would rather sacri- 
 fice my life than my honour.' 
 
 " The King had neither strength nor 
 spirits to make an answer. They conti- 
 nued to break their way through the un- 
 derwood, until they approached Marie- 
 mont. Here Stanislaus, unable to stir 
 another step, sunk down at the foot of 
 the old yew-tree, and again implored for 
 one moment's rest. Kosinski no longer 
 refused. This unexpected humanity en- 
 couraged His Majesty to employ the 
 minutes they sat together in another 
 attempt to soften his heart j and to con-

 vince him, that the oath which he had 
 taken was atrocious, and by no means 
 binding to a brave and virtuous man* 
 
 " Kosinski heard him with attention ; 
 and even showed he was affected. * But/ 
 said he, * if I should assent to what you 
 propose, and reconduct you to Warsaw, 
 what will be the consequence to me ? I 
 shall be taken and executed.' — * I 
 give you my word,' answered the King, 
 * that you shall not suffer any injury. 
 But if you doubt my honour, escape 
 while you can. I shall find some place 
 of shelter ; and will direct your pursuers 
 to take the opposite road to that which 
 you may choose.' Kosinski, entirely over- 
 come, threw himself on his knees before 
 His Majesty ; and, imploring pardon for 
 what he had done, swore, that from this 
 hour he would defend his King against 
 all the conspirators ; and would trust 
 confidently in his word for future pre- 
 servation. Stanislaus repeated his pro- 
 mise of forgiveness and protection ; and

 directed him to seek refuge for them 
 both in the mill near which they 
 were discoursing. Kosinski obeyed, and 
 knocked ; but no one gave answer. He 
 then broke a pane of glass in the window, 
 and through it, begged succour for a no- 
 bleman who had been way-laid by rob- 
 bers. The miller refused to come out, 
 or to let them in ; telling them it 
 was his belief, that they were robbers 
 themselves ; and if they did not go away, 
 he would fire on them. 
 
 <* This dispute had continued for 
 nearly an hour, when the King contrived 
 to crawl up close to the windows, and 
 said, * My good friend, if we were ban- 
 ditti as you suppose, it would be as easy 
 for us, without all this parley, to break 
 into your house, as to break this pane of 
 glass ; therefore if you would not incur 
 the shame of suffering a fellow- creature 
 to perish for want of assistance, give us 
 admittance.' This argument had its 
 weight with the man, and opening the

 door he desired them to enter. After 
 some trouble, his Majesty procured pen 
 and ink ; and addressing a few hues to 
 me at the palace, with difficulty pre- 
 vailed on one of the miller's sons to 
 carry it ; so fearful were they of falling 
 in w^ith any of the troop, who, they un- 
 derstood, had plundered their guests. 
 
 " My joy at sight of this note, I can- 
 not describe. I well remember the con- 
 tents ; they were literally these : 
 
 " ' By the miraculous hand of Provi- 
 dence I have escaped from the hands of 
 assassins, I am now at the mill of Marie- 
 mont. Send immediately, and take me 
 hence. I am wounded, but not danger- 
 ously.' 
 
 " Regardless of my own condition, I 
 instantly got into a carriage, and, fol- 
 lowed by a detachment of horse, arrived 
 at the mill. I met Kosinski at the door, 
 keeping guard with his sword drawn. 
 As he knew my person, he admitted me 
 directly. The King had fallen into a 
 sleep ; and lay in one corner of the

 hovel on the ground, covered with the 
 miller's cloak. To see the most vir- 
 tuous monarch in the world, thus abused 
 by his ungrateful subjects, pierced me to 
 the heart ; and kneeling down by his side, 
 I took hold of his hand, and in a paroxysm 
 of tears, which I am not ashamed to con- 
 fess, I exclaimed, * I thank thee. Al- 
 mighty God, that I again see my sove- 
 reign alive !' It is not easy to say how 
 these words struck the simple family. 
 They dropped on their knees before the 
 King, whom my voice had awakened, and 
 beseeched his pardon for all their ill-man- 
 ners. The good Stanislaus soon quieted 
 their fears ; and graciously thanking them 
 for their kindness, told the miller to come 
 to the palace the next day, when he would 
 show him his gratitude in a better way 
 than by promises. 
 
 The officers of the detachment then 
 assisted His Majesty and myself into the 
 carriage ; and, accompanied by Kosinski, 
 we reached Warsaw about six in the 
 morning."

 « Yes," interrupted Butzou, ** I re- 
 member my tumultuous joy, when the 
 news was brought to me, in my bed, that 
 I had not in vain received the wounds in- 
 tended for my sovereign ; it ahuost de- 
 prived me of my senses : — and besides, 
 His Majesty visited his poor soldier in his 
 chamber. Does not your Excellency 
 recollect, how he was brought into my 
 room in a chair, between two men ? and 
 how he thanked me, and shook hands 
 with me ? It made me weep like a child." 
 
 " But," enquired Thaddeus, hardly re- 
 covering from the deep attention with 
 which he had listened to this recital ; 
 " what became of Kosinski ? I suppose 
 the King kept his word." 
 
 " He did indeed," replied Sobieski ; 
 <* his word is at all times sacred. Yet I 
 believe Kosinski entertained fears tliat 
 he would not be so generous ; for I per- 
 ceived him change colour very often, 
 while we were in the coach. However 
 he was tranquillised, when His Majesty,

 on alighting at the palace in the midst of 
 the joyous cries of the people, leaned 
 upon his arm, and presented him to the 
 populace as his preserver. The great gate 
 was ordered to be left open ; and never, 
 whilst I live, shall I again behold such a 
 scene ! Every soul in Warsaw, from the 
 highest to the lowest, came to catch a 
 glimpse of their rescued sovereign. See- 
 ing the doors free, they entered without 
 ceremony ; and thronged forwards in 
 crowds to get near enough to kiss his 
 hand, or to touch his clothes ; then, elated 
 with joy, they turned to Kosinski, and 
 loaded him with demonstrations of grati- 
 tude, calling him the ' Saviour of their 
 KingJ Kosinski bore all this with sur- 
 prising firmness ; but in a day or two, 
 when the facts became known, he guessed 
 he might meet with different treatment 
 from the people, and therefore petitioned 
 His Majesty for leave to depart. Stanis- 
 laus consented ; and he retired to Semi- 
 gallia, where he now lives, on a handsome 
 pension from the King."

 " Generous Stanislaus !" exclaimed 
 the General ; " you see, my dear young 
 Count, how he has rewarded me, for do- 
 ing that which was merely my duty. He 
 put it at my option, to become what I 
 pleased about his person, or to hold what 
 rank I liked in the army. Love enno- 
 bles servitude ; and, attached as I have 
 ever been to your family, under whom 
 all my ancestors have lived and fought, 
 I vowed in my own mind never to quit 
 it; and accordingly, begged permission 
 of my sovereign to remain with the 
 Count Sobieski. I did remain : but 
 see," cried he, his voice faltering, 
 ** what my benefactors have made of 
 me ! I command those troops, amongst 
 whom, it was once my greatest glory to 
 be a private soldier." 
 
 Thaddeus pressed the hand of the ve- 
 teran between both his; and regarded 
 him with respect and affection, whilst 
 the grateful old man wiped away a tear 
 from his face.

 " How happy ought it to make yoLT, 
 my son," observed Sobieski : " that you 
 are called out to support such a sovereign I 
 He is not merely a King, whom you fol- 
 low to battle, because he will lead you to 
 honour. The hearts of his people ac- 
 knowledge him in a superior light ; they 
 look on him as their Patriarchal head ; 
 as a being delegated by God, to study 
 what is their greatest good ; to bestow it ; 
 and, when it is attacked, to defend it. 
 To preserve the life of such a sovereign, 
 who would not sacrifice his own ? 
 
 *« Yes," cried Butzou ; ** and how 
 ou'oht we to abhor them who threaten his 
 life ! How ought we to estimate those 
 crowned heads, who, under the mask of 
 amity, have, from the year sixty-four 
 when he ascended the throne, until now% 
 been plotting his overthrow or death ! 
 Either calamity, O Heaven, avert ! But 
 his death, I fear, will be a prelude to the 
 certain ruin of our country !" 
 
 <* Not so/' interrupted Thaddeus, with

 eagerness ; " not whilst a Polander has 
 power to lift an arm, shall it be quite lost." 
 Butzou applauded his spirit ; and was 
 warmly seconded by the Palatine, who, 
 (never weary of infusing into every feeling 
 of his grandson an interest for his coun- 
 try,) pursued the discourse ; and dwelt 
 minutely on the happy tendency of the 
 glorious constitution of 1791, in defence 
 of which they were now going to hazard 
 their lives. As Sobieski pointed out its 
 several excellencies, and expatiated on 
 the pure spirit of freedom which animated 
 its laws, the soul of Thaddeus followed 
 his eloquence ; and with the unrestrained 
 fervour of youth, he branded the names 
 of Catherine, and the faithless Frederick, 
 with some of those epithets, which pos- 
 terity will affix to them for ever. During 
 these conversations, Thaddeus forgot his 
 regrets ; and at noon, on the third day, 
 lie saw his grandfather put himself at the 
 head of his men, and commence a regu- 
 lar march.

 The little army of the Palatine passed 
 by the battlements of Chelm ; crossed 
 the Bug into the plains of Volhinia ; and 
 impatiently counted the leagues over 
 those vast tracts, until it reached the 
 borders of Kiovia. 
 
 When the column, at the head of which 
 Thaddeus was stationed, descended the 
 heights of Lininy, and the broad camp of 
 his countrymen burst upon his sight, his 
 heart heaved with an emotion quite new 
 to him. He beheld with admiration the 
 regular disposition of the entrenchments, 
 the long intersected streets, and the war- 
 like appearance of the soldiers, whom he 
 could descry, even at that distance, by 
 the beams of a bright evening sun which 
 shone upon their arms.

 In half an hour, his troops descended 
 
 into the plain ; where, meeting those of 
 
 the Palatine, and the General, the three 
 
 columns again united ; and Thaddeus 
 
 joined his grandfather in the van. 
 
 " My Lord," cried he, as they met, 
 " can I behold such a sight, and despair 
 of the freedom of Poland !'* 
 
 Sobieski made no reply ; but giving 
 him one of those expressive looks of ap- 
 probation, which immediately makes its 
 way to the soul, commanded the troops 
 to advance with greater speed. In a few 
 minutes they reached the outworks of the 
 camp, and entered the lines. The eager 
 eye of Thaddeus wandered from object 
 to object. Thrilling with that delight, 
 with which youth beholds wonders, and 
 anticipates more, he stopped with the rest 
 of the party before a tent, which General 
 Butzou informed him belonged to the 
 commander in chief. They were met in 
 the vestibule, by an hussar officer of a 
 most commanding appearance. Sobieski,

 and he, having accosted each other 
 with mutual congratulations, the Pala- 
 tine turned to Thaddeus, took him by 
 tiie hand, and presenting him to his 
 friend, said with a smile, 
 
 " Here, my dear Kosciuszko, this 
 young man is my grandson ; he is called 
 Thaddeus Sobieski ; and I trust, that he 
 will not disgrace either of our names !" 
 
 Kosciuszko embraced the young Count ; 
 and, with a hearty pressure of his hand, 
 replied, " Thaddeus! if you resemble your 
 grandfather, you can never forget, tiiat 
 tiie only King of Poland who equalled Sta- 
 nislaus, was a Sobieski ; and, as becomes 
 liis descendant, you will not spare your best 
 blood in tiie service of your country." 
 
 As Kosciuszko finished speaking, an 
 aide-de-camp came forward to lead the 
 party into tiie room of audience. Prince 
 Poniatowski welcomed the Palatine and 
 his suite with the most lively expressions 
 of pleasure. He gave Thaddeus, whose 
 figure and manner instantiy charmed him.

 many flattering assurances of friendship ; 
 and promised, that he would appoint him 
 to the first post of honour which should 
 offer. After detaining the Palatine and 
 his grandson half an hour, His Highness 
 withdrew ; and they rejoined Kosciuszko, 
 who conducted them to the quarter where 
 the Masovian soldiers had already pitched 
 their tents. 
 
 The officers who supped with Sobieski, 
 left him at an early hour, that he might 
 retire to rest ; but Thaddeus was neither 
 able nor inclined to benefit by their con- 
 sideration. He laid liimself on the bed, 
 shut his eyes, and tried to sleep ; but the 
 attempt was without success ; in vain he 
 turned from side to side ; in vain he at- 
 tempted to restrict his thoughts to one 
 thing at once : his imagination was so 
 roused by anticipating the scenes in which 
 he w^as to become an actor, that he found 
 it impossible even to lie stilL His spirits 
 being quite awake, lie determined to rise, 
 and to walk himself drowsy. 
 
 Seeing his grandfather sound asleep, he

 got Up and dressed himself quietly ; then 
 stealing gently from the marquee, he gave 
 the word in a low whisper to the guard at 
 the door, and proceeded down the lines. 
 The pitying moon seemed to stand in the 
 heavens, watching the awaking of those 
 heroes who the next day might sleep to 
 rise no more. At another time, and in 
 another mood, such might have been his 
 reflections ; but now he pursued his walk 
 with different thoughts : no meditations 
 but those of pleasure possessed his breast. 
 He looked on the moon with transport : 
 he beheld the light of that beautiful pla- 
 net, trailing its long stream of glory across 
 the entrenchments. He perceived a so- 
 litary candle here and there, glimmering 
 through the curtained entrance of the 
 tents ; and thought that their inmates 
 were probably longing, with the same 
 anxiety as himself, for the morning's dawn. 
 Thaddeus walked slowly on ; some- 
 times pausing at the lonely footfall of the 
 centinel, or answering with a start to the 
 sudden challenge for the parole; then

 lingering at the doo'r of some of these 
 canvas dwellings, he offered up a prayer 
 for the brave inhabitant, who, like him- 
 self, had quitted the endearments of home, 
 to expose his life on this spot, a bulwark 
 of liberty. Thaddeus knew not what it 
 was to be a soldier by profession ; he had 
 no idea of making war a trade, by which 
 a man is at any rate to acquire subsist- 
 ence and wealth : he had but one motive 
 for appearing in the field, and one for 
 leaving it : To repel invasion, and to es- 
 tablish peace. — The first energy of his 
 mind, was a desire to assert the rights of 
 his country : It had been inculcated into 
 him, when an infant; it had been the 
 subject of his morning thoughts and 
 nightly dreams ; it was now the passion 
 which beat in every artery of his heart; 
 yet he knew no honour in slaughter ; his 
 glory lay in defence ; and, when that was 
 accomplished, his sword would return to 
 its scabbard, unstained by the blood of a 
 vanquished, or an invaded people. On 
 these principles, he was at this hour full 
 D 6

 of enthusiasm : a glow of triumph flitted 
 over his cheek, for he had left the indul- 
 gences of his mother's palace, had left 
 her maternal arms, to take upon him the 
 toils of war, and risk an existence just 
 blown into enjoyment. A noble satisfac- 
 tion rose in his mind ; and with all the 
 animation which an inexperienced and 
 raised fancy imparts to that age when boy- 
 hood breaks into man, his soul grasped at 
 every show of creation with the confidence 
 of belief. Pressing the sabre which he 
 held in his hand, to his lips, he half ut- 
 tered, " Never shall this sword leave my 
 arm, but at the command of mercy, or 
 when death deprives my nerves of their 
 strength." 
 
 Morning was tinging the hills which 
 bound the eastern horizon of Winnica, be- 
 fore Thaddeus found that his pelisse was 
 wet with dew, and that he ought to return 
 to his tent. Hardly had he laid his head 
 upon the pillow, and * lulled his senses in 
 forgetfulnesSy when he was disturbed by 
 the drum beating to arms. He opened his

 eyes ; and seeing the Palatine out of bed, 
 lie sprung from his own, and eagerly en- 
 quired the cause of the alarm. 
 
 " Only follow me directly," answered 
 his grandfather, and quitted the tent. 
 
 Whilst Thaddeus was putting on his 
 clothes; and buckling on his arms with 
 a trembling eagerness which almost de- 
 feated his haste, an aide-de-camp of the 
 Prince entered. He brought information 
 tliat an advanced guard of the Russians 
 had attacked a Polish out-post, under the 
 command of Colonel Lomza ; and that 
 His Highness had ordered a detachment 
 from the Palatine's brigade to march to 
 its relief. Before Thaddeus could reply, 
 Sobieski sent to apprise his grandson, the 
 Prince had appointed him to be second in 
 command over the troops which were 
 turning out to assist the Colonel. 
 
 Thaddeus heard this message with de- 
 light: yet fearful in what manner the 
 event might answer the expectations 
 which this high distinction declared, he

 issued from his tent like a youthful Mars ; 
 or rather like the Spartan Isadas, trem- 
 bling at the dazzling effects of his temerity ; 
 and hiding his valour and his blushes be- 
 neath the waving plumes of his helmet. 
 Kosciuszko, who was to head the party, 
 observed this modesty with pleasure, and 
 shaking him warmly by the hand, " Go, 
 Thaddeus," said he, " take your station 
 on the left flank ; I shall require your 
 fresh spirits to lead the charge I intend 
 it to make, and to ensure its success." 
 Thaddeus bowed to these encouraging 
 words, and took his place according to 
 order. 
 
 Every thing being ready, the detach- 
 ment quitted the camp ; and dashing 
 through the dews of a sweet morning, for 
 it was yet May, in a few hours arrived in 
 view of the Russian battalions. Lomza, 
 who from the only redoubt now in his 
 possession, caught a glimpse of this wel- 
 come reinforcement, rallied his few re- 
 maining men, and by the time that Kos-

 ciuszko came up, contrived to join him 
 in the van. The fight re-commenced. 
 Thaddeus at the head of his hussars, in 
 full gallop, bore down upon the enemy. 
 They received the charge with firmness ; 
 but their young adversary, perceiving 
 that extraordinary means were necessary, 
 exerted his voice to the utmost ; calling 
 on his men to follow him, he put spurs to 
 his horse, and rushed into the thickest 
 of the battle. His soldiers did not shrink : 
 they pressed on, mowing down the fore- 
 most ranks : whilst he, by a lucky stroke 
 of his sabre, disabled the sword-arm of 
 the Russian standard-bearer, and seized 
 the colours. His own troops seeing the 
 standard in his hand, with one accord, in 
 loud and repeated cries shouted victory. 
 The reserve of the enemy alarmed at this 
 outcry, instantly gave way j and retreating 
 with precipitation, was soon followed by 
 the rear ranks of the centre ; where Kos- 
 ciuszko had already slain the commander 
 of the attack. The flanks next gave 
 ground 5 and after holding a short stand

 at intervals, at length fairly turned about, 
 and fled, panic-struck, across the country. 
 The conquerors, elated with so sudden 
 a success, put their horses on full speed ; 
 and without order or attention, pursued 
 the fugitives, until they were lost amidst 
 the trees of a distant wood. Kosciuszko 
 called on his men to stop ; but he called 
 in vain : they continued their career, ani- 
 mating each other; and with redoubled 
 shouts, drowned the voice of Thaddeus, 
 who was galloping forwards, repeating the 
 command. At the entrance of the wood 
 they were stopped by a few stragglers, 
 who had formed themselves into a body. 
 These men withstood the first onset of 
 the Poles with considerable steadiness ; 
 but after a short skirmish, they fled a 
 second time, and took refuge in the 
 bushes, where, still regardless of orders, 
 their enemies followed. Kosciuszko, 
 foreseeing the consequence of this rash- 
 ness, ordered Thaddeus to dismount part 
 of his squadron, and march after these 
 headstrong men, into the forest. He came

 up with them on the edge of a heathy 
 tract of land, just as they were closmg in 
 with a band of arquebusiers, who, having 
 kept up a quick running fire as they re- 
 treated, had drawn their pursuers thus far 
 into the thickets. Heedless of any thing 
 but giving their enemy a complete defeat, 
 tlie Polanders went on, never looking to 
 the left nor to the right, till all at once 
 they found themselves encompassed by 
 two thousand Muscovite horse, several 
 battalions of chasseurs, and in front of 
 fourteen pieces of cannon, which tliis 
 dreadful ambuscade opened upon them. 
 
 Thaddeus threw himself into the midst 
 of his countrymen, and taking the place 
 of their unfortunate conductor, who had 
 been killed in the first sweep of the artil- 
 lery, prepared the men for a desperate 
 stand. He gave his orders with intrepi- 
 dity and coolness, though under a heavy 
 shower of musquetry, and a cannonade, 
 which carried death in every round. For 
 liimself he had no care 5 how to relieve

 the brave Poles from the dilemma into 
 which they had plunged themselves, was 
 the only thought that occupied his mind. 
 In a few minutes, the scattered soldiers 
 were consolidated into a close body, 
 flanked and reared with pikemen ; who 
 stood, like a grove of pines in a day of 
 tempest, only moving their heads and 
 arms. Many of the Russian horse, im- 
 paled themselves on the sides of this little 
 phalanx, which they vainly attempted to 
 shake, although the ordnance was rapidly 
 weakening its strength. File after file, 
 the men were swept down j their bodies 
 making a horrid rampart for their brave 
 comrades, who, rendered desperate, at 
 last threw away their most cumbrous ac- 
 coutrements, and crying to their leader, 
 " Escape or death !" followed him sword 
 in hand; and bearing like a torrent upon 
 the enemy's ranks, cut their way through 
 the forest. The Russians, exasperated 
 that their prey should not only escape, 
 but escape by such dauntless valour.

 hung closely on their rear, goading them 
 with musquetry ; whilst they, (like a 
 wounded lion, hardly pressed by the 
 hunters, who retreats, and yet stands 
 proudly at bay,) gradually retired towards 
 the camp with a backward step, their 
 faces towards the foe. 
 
 Meanwhile, Sobieski, anxious for the 
 fate of the day, mounted the dyke, and 
 looked eagerly around for the arrival of 
 some messenger from the little army. As 
 the wind blew strongly from the south, a 
 cloud of dust precluded his view ; but 
 from the approach of firing, and the 
 clashing of arms, he was led to fear that 
 his friends had been defeated, and were 
 retreating towards the camp. He in- 
 stantly quitted the lines to call out a re- 
 inforcement j but before he could advance, 
 Koscluszko and his squadron on the full 
 charge, appeared in flank of the enemy ; 
 who suddenly halted, and wheeling round, 
 left the harassed Polanders to enter the 
 trenches unmolested.

 Thaddeus, covered with dust and 
 blood, flung himself into his grandfather's 
 arms. In the heat of action, his left arm 
 had been wounded by a Cossac. Aware 
 that loss of blood might disable him from 
 further service, at the moment it happen- 
 ed he bound it up in his sash, and had 
 thought no more of the accident until 
 the Palatine remarked blood on his cloak. 
 
 " My injury is slight, my dear sir ;" said 
 he, " I wish to heaven, that it were all the 
 evil which has befallen us to-day ! Look 
 at the remnant of our brave comrades." 
 
 Sobieski turned his eyes on the panting 
 soldiers, and on Kosciuszko, who was in- 
 specting them. Some of them, no longer 
 upheld by desperation, were sinking with 
 wounds and fatigues ; these, the good 
 General sent off in litters to the medical 
 department ; and others, who had sus- 
 tained unharmed the conflict of the day, 
 after having received the praise and ad- 
 monition of their commander, were dis« 
 missed to their quarters.

 Before this inspection was over, the 
 Palatine had to assist Thaddeus to his 
 tent ; who, in spite of his exertions to 
 the contrary, became so faint that it was 
 necessary to lead him off the ground. 
 
 A short time restored him. With his 
 arm in a sling, he joined his brother 
 officers on the fourth day. After the duty 
 of the morning, he heard with concern 
 that during his confinement the Russians 
 had augmented their force to so tremen- 
 dous a strength, it was impossible for the 
 comparatively slender force of the Poles 
 to remain longer at Winnica. In conse- 
 quence of this report, the Prince had 
 convened a council late the preceding 
 night, in which it was determined that 
 the camp should immediately be razed, 
 and removed towards Zieleme. 
 
 This information displeased Thaddeus, 
 who in his fairy dreams of war, had 
 always made conquest the sure end of 
 his battles ; — and many were the sighs 
 he drew, when, at an hour before dawn

 on the following day, he witnessed the 
 striking of the tents, which, he thought, 
 was only the prelude to a shameful flight 
 from the enemy. While he was standing 
 by the busy people, and musing on the 
 nice line which divides prudence from 
 pusillanimity, his grandfather came up. 
 He desired him to mount his horse ; and 
 told him, that owing to the unhealed 
 state of his wound, he was removed from 
 the van guard, and ordered to march 
 in the centre, along with the Prince. 
 Thaddeus remonstrated against this ar- 
 rangement ; and almost reproached the 
 Palatine, for forfeiting his promise, that 
 he should always be stationed near his 
 person. Sobieski would not be moved, 
 either by argument or entreaty ; and 
 Thaddeus, finding that he neither could, 
 nor ought oppose him, obeyed, and fol- 
 lowed an aid-de-camp to His Highness.

 CHAP. IV. 
 
 After a march of three hours, the army 
 came in sight of Volunna, where the 
 advanced column suddenly halted. Thad- 
 deus, who was about half a mile to its 
 rear, with a throbbing heart, heard that a 
 momentous pass must be disputed before 
 they could proceed. He curbed his 
 horse, then gave it the spur ; so eagerly 
 did he wish to penetrate the cloud of 
 smoke which rose in volumes from the 
 discharge of musquetry, on whose wing, 
 at every round, he dreaded might be 
 carried the fate of his grandfather. At 
 last the firing ceased, and the troops 
 were commanded to go forward. On 
 entering the contested defile, Thaddeus 
 shuddered ; for at every step the heels of 
 his charger struck upon the wounded or 
 the dead. There lay his enemies, here

 lay his friends ! his respiration was nearly 
 suspended ; and his eyes clung to the 
 ground, expecting at each moment, to 
 fasten on the breathless body of his 
 grandfather. 
 
 Again the tumult of battle presented 
 itself. About an hundred soldiers, in one 
 firm rank, stood at the end of the pass, 
 firing on the rear guard of the Russians. 
 Thaddeus checked his horse. Five hun- 
 dred had been detached to this post; 
 how few remained ! Could he hope So- 
 bieski had escaped so desperate a ren- 
 contre ? Fearing the worst, and dreading 
 to have those fears confirmed, his heart 
 sickened when he received orders from 
 Poniatowski to examine the extent of the 
 loss. He rode to the mouth of the defile. 
 He could no where see the Palatine. A 
 few of his hussars, a little in advance, 
 were engaged over a heap of the killed, 
 defending it from a troop of chasseurs, 
 who appeared fighting for the barbarous 
 privilege of trampling on the bodies,

 Thaddeus at this sight, and impelled by 
 despair, called out, *' Courage, soldiers ; 
 the Prince is here." The chasseurs 
 looking forward, saw the information was 
 true, and took to flight. Poniatowski, 
 almost at the word, was by the side of 
 his young friend, who, unconscious of any 
 idea but that of filial solicitude had dis- 
 mounted. 
 
 " Where is the Palatine ?" was his im- 
 mediate enquiry to a soldier who was 
 stooping towards the slain. The man 
 made no answer, but lifted from the 
 heap the bodies of two soldiers ; beneath, 
 Thaddeus saw the pale and deadly fea- 
 tures of his grandfather. He staggered 
 a few paces back : and the Prince thinking 
 he was falling, hastened to support him ; 
 but he recovered himseifi and flew for- 
 wards to assist Kosciuszko, who had 
 raised the head of the Palatine upon hi 
 knee. 
 
 " Is he alive ?" enquired Thaddeus. 
 
 *« He breathes."

 Hope was now warm in his breast. The 
 soldiers soon released Sobieski from the 
 surrounding dead ; but his swoon continu- 
 ing, the Prince desired that he might be 
 laid on a bank, until a litter could be 
 brought from the rear ranks to convey 
 him to a place of security. Meantime, 
 Thaddeus and the General bound up his 
 wounds, and poured some water into his 
 lips. The effusion of blood being stopped, 
 the brave veteran opened his eyes ; and 
 in a few minutes, whilst he leaned on the 
 bosom of his grandson, was so far re- 
 stored as to receive, with his usual 
 modest dignity, the thanks of His High- 
 ness for the intrepidity with which he 
 had preserved a passage, which ensured 
 the safety of the whole army. 
 
 Two surgeons who arrived with the 
 litter, relieved the anxiety of the by- 
 standers, by an assurance that the wounds, 
 which they re-examined, were not dan- 
 gerous. Having laid their patient on the 
 vehicle, they were preparing to retire

 with it into the rear, when Thaddeus 
 petitioned the Prince to grant him per- 
 mission to take the command of the 
 guard which was appointed to attend his 
 grandfather. His Highness consented ; 
 but Sobieski positively refused. 
 
 " No, Thaddeus,'' said he ; *' you 
 forget the effect which this soUcitude 
 about so trifling a matter might have on 
 the men. Remember, that he who goes 
 into battle, only puts his own life to the 
 hazard ; but he that abandons the field, 
 sports with the lives of his soldiers. Do 
 not give them leave to suppose, that even 
 your dearest interest could tempt you 
 from the front of danger, when it is 
 your duty to remain there." Thaddeus 
 obeyed his grandfather in silence ; and 
 at seven o'clock the army resumed its 
 march. 
 
 Near Zielime, the Prince was saluted 
 by a re-inforcement. It appeared very 
 seasonably ; for scouts had brought in- 
 formation that directly across the plain the 
 Russians, under General Branicki, were 
 E 2

 drawn up in order of battle, to dispute 
 his progress. 
 
 Thaddeus, for the first time, shuddered 
 at the sight of the enemy. Should his 
 friends be defeated, what might be the 
 fate of his grandfather, now rendered 
 helpless by many wounds ! Occupied by 
 these fears, with anxiety in his heart, he 
 kept his place at the head of the light 
 horse, close to the hill. 
 
 Prince Poniatowski ordered the lines 
 to extend themselves, that the right 
 should reach to the river ; and the left 
 he covered by a rising ground, on which 
 were mounted seven pieces of ordnance. 
 Immediately after these dispositions, the 
 battle commenced. It continued with 
 violence and unabated fury from eight in 
 the morning until sunset. Several times 
 the Poles were driven from their ground ; 
 but as often recovering themselves, and 
 animated by their commanders, they pro- 
 secuted the fight with advantage. Ge- 
 neral Branicki perceiving that the fortune 
 of the day was going against him, ordered

 up the body of reserve ; which consisted 
 of four thousand men and several cannon. 
 He erected temporary batteries in a few 
 minutes ; — and with these new forces 
 opened a rapid and destructive fire on 
 the Polanders. Kosciuszko, alarmed at 
 perceiving a retrograde motion in his 
 troops, gave orders for a close attack on 
 the enemy in front, whilst Thaddeus, at 
 the head of his hussars, should wheel 
 round the hill of artillery, and with loud 
 cries, charge the opposite flank. This 
 stratagem succeeded. The cossacks who 
 were posted on that spot, seeing the im- 
 petuosity of the Poles, and the quarter 
 whence they came, supposed them to be 
 a fresh squadron ; gave ground, and 
 opening in all directions, threw their own 
 people into a confusion that completed 
 the defeat. Kosciuszko and the Prince 
 were equally successful ; and a general 
 panic amongst their adversaries was the 
 consequence. The whole of the Russian 
 army now took to flight, except a few

 regiments of carabiniers, which were en- 
 tangled between the river and the Poles. 
 These were immediately surrounded by 
 a battalion of Masovian infantry 5 who, 
 enraged at the loss their body had sus- 
 tained the preceding day, answered a 
 cry for quarter, with reproach and de- 
 rision. At this instant, the Sobieski 
 squadron came up 5 and Thaddeus, who 
 saw the perilous situation of these regi- 
 ments, ordered the slaughter to cease, 
 and the men to be taken prisoners. The 
 Masovians exhibited strong signs of dis- 
 satisfaction at such commands ; but the 
 young Count, charging through them, 
 ranged his troops before the Russians, 
 and declared that the first man who 
 should dare to lift a sword against his 
 orders should be shot. The Poles dropped 
 their arms. The poor carabiniers fell 
 on their knees to thank his mercy ; whilst 
 their officers, in a sullen silence, which 
 seemed ashamed of gratitude, surren- 
 dered their swords into the hands of 
 their deliverers.

 During this scene, only one very young 
 Russian, appeared wholly refractory. He 
 held up his sword in a menacing pos- 
 ture, when Thaddeus drew near ; and 
 before he had time to speak, the young 
 man made a cut at his head, which a hussar 
 parried, by striking him to the earth, 
 and would have killed him on the spot, 
 had not Thaddeus caught the blow on his 
 own sword : then instantly dismounting, 
 he raised the officer from the ground, and 
 apologised for the too hasty zeal of his 
 soldier. The youth blushed, and bowing 
 presented his sword ; which was received, 
 and as directly returned. 
 
 " Brave Sir," said Thaddeus, " I con- 
 sider myself ennobled in restoring this 
 sword to him who has so courageously 
 defended it." 
 
 The Russian made no reply, but by a 
 second bow ; and put his hand on his 
 breast, which was wet with blood. Cere- 
 mony was now at an end. Thaddeus 
 never looked upon the unfortunate as

 Strangers, much less as enemies. Ac- 
 costing the wounded officer with a friend- 
 ly voice, he assured him of his services, 
 and made him lean on his shoulder. 
 The young man, incapable of speaking, 
 accepted his assistance ; but before a 
 conveyance could arrive, for which two 
 men were dispatched, he fainted in 
 his arms. Thaddeus being obliged to 
 join the Prince with his prisoners, un- 
 willingly left the young Russian in this 
 situation ; but before he did so, he di- 
 rected one of his lieutenants to take 
 care that the surgeons should pay at- 
 tention to the officer, and have his litter 
 carried next to the Palatine's during the 
 remainder of the march. 
 
 When the army halted at nine o'clock, 
 preparations were made to fix the camp ; 
 and in case of a surprisal from any part 
 of the dispersed enemy, which might 
 have rallied, orders were delivered for 
 throwing up a dyke. Tiiaddeus, having 
 been assured that his grandfather and

 the wounded Russian, were comfortably 
 stationed near each other, did not hesitate 
 to accept the command of the entrench- 
 ing party. To that end, he wrapped 
 himself loosely in his pelisse, and pre- 
 pared for a long watch. The night was 
 beautiful. It being the month of June, 
 a softening warmth still floated through 
 the air, as if the moon, which shone over 
 his head, emitted heat as well as splen- 
 dour. His mind was in unison with the 
 season. He rode slowly round, from 
 bank to bank ; sometimes speaking to 
 the workers in the fosse : sometimes 
 lingering for a few minutes looking on 
 the ground, he thought on the element 
 of which he was composed, to which he 
 might so soon return ; then gazing up- 
 wards, he observed the silent march of 
 the stars, and the moving scene of the 
 heavens. On whatever object he cast 
 his eyes, his soul, which the recent 
 events had dissolved into a temper not 
 the less delightful for being tinged with

 melancholy, meditated with intense com- 
 passion ; and dwelt with wonder on the 
 mind of man ; which, whilst it adores the 
 Creator of the universe, and measures the 
 immensity of space with an expansion of 
 intellect almost divine, can devote itself 
 to the narrow limits of sublunary posses- 
 sions ; and exchange the boundless para- 
 dise above, for the low enjoyments of 
 human pride. He looked with pity over 
 that wide tract of land, which now lay 
 betwixt him and the remains of those 
 four thousand Russians who had fallen 
 victims to the insatiate desires of am- 
 bition. He well knew the difference be- 
 tween a defender of his own country, and 
 the invader of another's. His heart beat, 
 his soul expanded, at the prospect of se- 
 curing liberty, and life, to a virtuous 
 people. He felt all the happiness of such 
 an achievement; while he could only 
 imagme, how that spirit must shrink from 
 reflection, which animates the self-con- 
 demned slave to fight, not merely to

 fasten chains on others, but to rivet his 
 own the closer. The best affections of 
 man having put the sword into the hand 
 of Thaddeus, his principles as a Chris* 
 tian, did not remonstrate against his 
 passion for arms* 
 
 When he was told the fortifications 
 were finished, he retired with a tranquil 
 step towards the Masovian quarters. He 
 found the Palatine awake, and eager to 
 welcome him with the joyful information 
 that his wounds were so slight as to pro- 
 mise a speedy amendment. Thaddeus 
 asked for his prisoner. The Palatine 
 answered, he was in the next tent, where 
 a surgeon closely attended him ; and who 
 had given a very favourable opinion of 
 the wound, which was in the muscles of 
 the breast, 
 
 *' Have you seen him, my dear Sir ?" 
 enquired Thaddeus. "Does he appear 
 to think himself well treated ?" 
 
 "Yes," replied the Palatine; " I was 
 supported into his marquee, before I re»

 tired to my own. I told him who I was, 
 and repeated your offers of service. He 
 received my proffer with expressions of 
 gratitude ; and at the same time de- 
 clared he had nothing to blame but his 
 own folly, for bringing him to the state 
 in which he now lies/* 
 
 "How, my Lord !" rejoined Thaddeus. 
 ** Does he repent of being a soldier ? or 
 is he ashamed of the cause for which he 
 fought ?" 
 
 "Both, Thaddeus ; he is not a Russian, 
 but a young Englishman.*' 
 
 " An Englishman ! and raise his arm 
 against a country struggling for liberty !" 
 
 " It is very true," returned the Pala- 
 tine : " but as he confesses it was his 
 folly, and the persuasions of others ^\hich 
 impelled him, he may be pardoned. He 
 is a mere youth: 1 think hardly your 
 age. I understand that he is of rank j

 Europe under the direction of a travel- 
 ling governor, he took Russia in his

 route. At Petersburg!!, he became in- 
 timate with many of the nobiUty ; par- 
 ticularly with Count Branicki, at whose 
 house he resided : and when the Count 
 was named to the command of the army 
 in Poland, Mr. Somerset, (for that is your 
 prisoner's name,) instigated by his own 
 volatility, and the arguments of his host, 
 volunteered with him ; and so followed his 
 friend to oppose that freedom here, which 
 he would have asserted in his own na- 
 tion." 
 
 Thaddeus thanked his grandfather for 
 this information ; and pleased that the 
 young man, who had so much interested 
 him, was any thing but a Muscovite, he 
 gaily, and instantly repaired to his tent. 
 
 A generous heart is as eloquent in ac- 
 knowledging benefits, as it is bounteous 
 in bestowing them ; and Mr. Somerset 
 received his preserver with the warmest 
 demonstrations of gratitude. Thaddeus 
 begged him not to consider himself as 
 particularly obliged, by a conduct whicli

 every soldier of honour has a right to 
 expect from another. The EngUshman 
 bowed his head ; and Thaddeus took a 
 seat by his bed-side. 
 
 Whilst he gathered from his own lips, 
 a corroboration of the narrative of the 
 Palatine, he could not forbear enquiring 
 how a person of his apparent candour ; 
 and who was also the native of a soil, 
 where liberty had so long been the pal- 
 ladium of its happiness, could volunteer 
 in a cause, the object of which was to 
 make a brave people slaves ? 
 
 Somerset listened to these questions 
 with blushes ; and they did not leave his 
 face when he confessed, that all he could 
 say in extenuation of what he had done 
 was to plead his youth, and having 
 thought little on the subject. 
 
 " I was wrought upon,'^ continued he, 
 ** by a variety of circumstances ; first, the 
 principles of Mr. Loftus, my governor, 
 are strongly in favour of the court of Pe- 
 tersburgh : secondly, my father disliked

 the army, and I am enthusiastically fond 
 of it j this was the only opportunity in 
 which I might ever satisfy my passion : 
 and lastly, I believe that I was dazzled 
 by the picture which the young men 
 about me, drew of the campaign. I 
 longed to be a soldier ; they persuaded 
 me ; and I followed them to the field as 
 I would have done to a ball-room, heed- 
 less of the consequence.'* 
 
 *' Yet," replied Thaddeus, smiling, 
 *< from the intrepidity with which you 
 maintained your ground, when your arms 
 were demanded, any one might have 
 thought that your whole soul as well as 
 your body, was engaged in the cause." 
 
 ** To be sure," returned Somerset, " I 
 was a blockhead to be there ; but when 
 there, I should have despised myself for 
 ever, had I given up my honour to the 
 ruffians who would have wrested my sword 
 from me ! But when i/ou came, noble So- 
 bieski, it was the fate of war, and I con- 
 tided myself to a brave man."

 Each succeeding morning, not only 
 brought fresh symptoms of recovery to

 mutual admiration of the young men, 
 into a solid and ardent esteem. 
 
 It is not the disposition of youthful 
 minds, to weigh for months and years, the 
 sterling value of those qualities which at- 
 tract them. As soon as they see virtue, 
 they respect it ; as soon as they meet 
 kindness, they believe it ; and as soon 
 as a union of both presents itselfi they 
 love it. Not having passed through the 
 disappointments of a delusive world, they 
 grasp for reality every pageant w^hich ap- 
 pears. They have not yet admitted that 
 cruel doctrine, which, when it takes ef- 
 fect, creates and extends the misery it

 affects to cure. Whilst we give up our 
 souls to suspicion, we gradually learn to 
 deceive ; whilst we repress the fervours of 
 our own hearts, we freeze those which ap- 
 proach us ; whilst we cautiously avoid oc- 
 casions of receiving pain, at every remove 
 we acquire an unconscious influence to 
 inflict it on those who follow us. They 
 again, meet from our conduct and lips 
 the reason and the lesson to destroy the 
 expanding sensibilities of their nature j. 
 and thus the tormenting chain of deceived 
 and deceiving characters is lengthened to 
 infinitude. 
 
 About the latter end of the month, So- 
 bieski received a summons to court, where 
 a Diet was to be held in consequence of 
 the victory at Zielime, to consider of fu- 
 ture proceedings. In the same packet 
 His Majesty enclosed a collar and inves- 
 titure of the order of St. Stanislaus, as an 
 acknowledgment of service to the young 
 Thaddeus ; and he accompanied it with 
 a note from himselfj expressing his com- 
 mands that the young knight should re-

 turn with the Palatine and other generals, 
 to receive thanks from the throne. 
 
 Thaddeus, half wild with delight, at 
 the thoughts of so soon meeting his mo- 
 ther, ran to the tent of his British friend 
 to communicate the tidings. Somerset 
 participated in his pleasure ; and with re- 
 ciprocal warmth accepted the invitation 
 to accompany him to Villanow. 
 
 " I would follow you, my friend," said 
 he, pressing the hand of Thaddeus, <* all 
 over the world." 
 
 "Then I will take you to the most 
 charming spot in it!" cried he. "Vil- 
 lanow is an Eden ; and my mother, the 
 dear angel, who would make a desert 
 so to me." 
 
 "You speak so rapturously of your 
 enchanted castle, Thaddeus," returned 
 his friend, " I believe, I shall consider 
 my knight-errantry in being fool enough 
 to trust myself amidst a fray in which I 
 had no business, as one of the wisest 
 acts of my life !"

 " I consider it," replied Thaddeus, 
 "as one of the luckiest events in mine." 
 
 Before the Palatine quitted the camp, 
 Somerset thought it proper to acquaint 
 Mr. Loftus, who was yet at Petersburgh, 
 of the particulars of his late danger ; and 
 that he was going to Warsaw wdth his 
 new friends, where he should remain for 
 several weeks. He added, that as the 
 court of Poland, through the intercession 
 of the Palatine, had generously given 
 him his liberty, he should be able to see 
 every thing in that country worthy of in- 
 vestigation ; and that he would write to 
 him again, enclosing letters for England, 
 soon after his arrival at the Polish capital. 
 
 The weather continuing fine, in a few 
 days the party left Zielime ; and the Pala- 
 tine and Somerset being so far restored 
 from their wounds, that they could walk, 
 the one with a crutch, and the other by 
 the support of his friend's arm, they 
 went through the journey with animation 
 and pleasure. The benign wisdom of

 Sobieski; the intelligent enthusiasm of 
 Thaddeus ; and the playful vivacity of 
 Somerset; mingling their different na- 
 tures, produced such a beautiful union, 
 that the minutes flew fast as their wishes. 
 A week more carried them into the pala- 
 tinate of Masovia ; and soon afterwards 
 within the walls of Villanow. 
 
 Every thing that presented itself to 
 Mr. Somerset was new and fascinating. 
 He saw, in the domestic felicity of his 
 friend, scenes which reminded him of the 
 social harmony of his own home. He 
 beheld in the palace and retinue of So- 
 bieski, all the magnificence which be- 
 spoke the descendant of a great King ; 
 and a power which wanted nothing of 
 royal grandeur, but the crown, which he 
 had the magnanimity to think and to 
 declare, was then placed upon a more 
 worthy brow. Whilst Somerset venerated 
 this true patriot, the high tone his mind 
 acquired, was not lowered by associat- 
 ing with characters nearer the common 
 standard. The friends of Sobieski were

 men of tried probity : Men, who, at all 
 times preferred their country's welfare, 
 before their own peculiar interest. Mr. 
 Somerset, day after day, listened with 
 deep attention to these virtuous and ener- 
 getic noblemen. He saw them full of fire 
 and personal courage when the affairs of 
 Poland were discussed ; and he beheld 
 with admiration, their perfect forgetful- 
 ness of themselves in their passion for the 
 general good. In these moments, his 
 heart bowed down before them ; and all 
 the pride of a Briton distended his breast, 
 when he thought that such as these men 
 are, his ancestors were. He remembered, 
 how often their chivalric virtues used to 
 occupy his reflections in the picture gal- 
 lery at Somerset Castle ; and his doubts, 
 when he compared what is, with what 
 was, that history had glossed over the ac- 
 tions of past centuries ; or that a differ- 
 ent order of men lived then, from those 
 which now inhabit the world. Thus, 
 studying the sublime characters of So- 
 bieski and his friends ; and enjoying the

 endearing kindness of Thaddeus and his 
 mother, did a fortnight pass away, with- 
 out his even recollecting the promise of 
 writing to his governor. At the end of 
 that period, he stole an hour from the 
 Countess's society ; and inclosed in a 
 short letter to Mr. Loflus the following 
 epistle to his mother : — 
 
 " To Lady Somerset ^ Somerset- 
 Castle, Leicestershire, 
 
 " Many weeks ago, my dearest mother, 
 I wrote a letter of seven sheets from Pe- 
 tersburgh"; which long ere this time, you 
 and my dear father must have received. 
 I attempted to give you some idea of the 
 manners of Russia ; and my vanity whis- 
 pers, that I succeeded tolerably well. The 
 court of the famous Catherine ; and the 
 attentions of the hospitable Count Bra- 
 nicki ; were then the subjects of my pen. 
 
 " But, how shall I account for my 
 being here ? How shall I allay your sur- 
 prise and displeasure, on seeing that this

 letter is dated from Warsaw ! I know 
 that I have acted against the wish of my 
 father, in visiting one of the countries he 
 proscribed. I know that I have dis- 
 obeyed your commands, in ever having 
 at any period of my Hfe taken up arms 
 without an indispensable necessity ; and 
 I have nothing to allege in my defence. 
 I fell in the way of temptation, and I 
 yielded to it. I really cannot enumerate 
 all the things which induced me to vo- 
 lunteer with the Russians ; suffice it to 
 say, that I did so ; and that we were de- 
 feated by the Poles at Zielime : and as 
 Heaven has rather rewarded your prayers, 
 than punished my imprudence, I trust 
 you will do the same, and pardon an in- 
 discretion I vow never to repeat. 
 
 " Notwithstanding all this, I must have 
 lost my life through my folly, had I not 
 been preserved, even in the moment when 
 death was pending over me, by a young 
 officer with whose family I now am. The

 virtue is hereditary ; and in this instance 
 our creed ii> duly honoured. The title is 
 Sobieski : the family which bears it, is the 
 only remaining posterity of the great mo- 
 narch of that name ; and the Count, who 
 is at its head, is Palatine of Masovia; 
 which, next to the throne, is the first dig- 
 nity m the state. He is one of the warm- 
 est champions of his country*s rights : 
 and though born to command, has so far 
 transgressed the golden adage of despots, 
 * Ignorance and subjection,^ that through- 
 out his territories, every man is taught to 
 worship his God with his heart as well as 
 with his knees. The understandings of 
 his peasants are opened to all useful know- 
 ledge. He does not put books of science 
 and speculations into their hands, to con- 
 sume their time in vain pursuits ; he gives 
 them the Bible ; and implements of indus- 
 try \ to afford them the means of know- 
 ing, and of practising their duty. All

 Masovia, around his palace, blooms like 
 a garden. The cheerful faces of the 
 farmers ; and the blessings which I hear 
 them implore on the family, when I am 
 walking in the fields with the young 
 Count, (for in this country, the sons bear 
 the same title with their fathers,) have 
 even drawn a few delighted drops from 
 the eyes of your thoughtless son! I know 
 that you think I have nothing senti- 
 mental about me ; else you would not so 
 often have poured into my 7iot inattentive 
 earSy * that to estimate the pleasures of 
 earth and heaven, we must cultivate the 
 sensibilities of the heart. Shut our eyes 
 against them, and we are merely nicely 
 constructed speculums, which reflect the 
 beauties of nature, but enjoy none.' 
 You see, mamma, that I both remember 
 and adopt your lessons.

 and much of my happiness since ; for he 
 is not only the bravest, but the most 
 amiable young man in the kingdom ; 
 and he is my friend. Indeed, as things 
 have happened, you must think that out 
 of evil has come good. Though I have 
 been disobedient, my fault has intro- 
 duced me to the affection of people 
 whose friendship will hence forward con- 
 stitute the greatest pleasure of my days. 
 The mother of Thaddeus is the only 
 daughter of the Palatine ; and of her, I 
 can say no more, than that nothing on 
 earth can more remind me of you ; she 
 is equally charming; equally tender to 
 your son. 
 
 " Whilst the Palatine is engaged at the 
 Diet, Her Excellency, Thaddeus, and 
 myself, with now and then a few visitors 
 from Warsaw, form the most agreeable 
 parties you can suppose. We walk to- 
 gether, we read together, we converse 
 together, we sing together : at least, the 
 Countess sings to us ; which is all the

 same: and you know, that time flies 
 swiftly on the wings of harmony. She 
 has an uncommonly sweet voice ; and a 
 taste which I never heard paralleled. 
 By the way, you cannot imagine any 
 thing more beautiful than the Polish 
 music. It partakes of that delicious 
 languor so distinguished in the Turkish 
 airs ; with a mingling of those wander- 
 ing melodies, which the now-forgotten 
 composers must have caught from the 
 Tartars. In short, whilst the Countess is 
 singing, I hardly suffer myself to breathe ; 
 and I feel, just what our poetical friend 
 William Scarsdale said a twelvemonth ago 
 at a concert of yours, * I feel as if love 
 sat upon my heart, and flapped it with 
 his wings.'

 that, in short, you and my father will re-

 repeated my entreaties both to the Coun-

 if I begin in the usual descriptive style ! 
 You know, there is only one way to de-

 no blame can be thrown on me for tak-

 *« When we left Zielime, and advanced 
 into the province of Masovia, the coun- 
 try around Prague rose at every step in 
 fresh beauty. The numberless chains of 
 gently swelling hills, which encompass 
 it on each side of the Vistula, were in 
 some parts chequered with corn field^S 
 meadows, and green pastures covered 
 with sheep, whose soft bleatings thrilled 
 in my ears, and transported my senses 
 into new regions ; so different was my 
 charmed and tranquillized mind, from 
 the tossing anxieties attendant on the 
 horrors I had recently witnessed. Surely 
 there is nothing in the world, short of 
 the most undivided reciprocal attach- 
 ment, that has such power over the

 workings of the human heart, as the mild 
 sweetness of nature. The most ruffled 
 temper, when emerging from the town, 
 will subside into a calm at the sight of a 
 wide stretch of landscape reposing in 
 the twilight of a fine evening. It is then 
 that the spirit of peace settles upon the 
 heart, unfetters the thoughts, and elevates 
 the soul to the Creator. It is then that 
 we behold the Parent of the universe in 
 his works ; we see his grandeur, in earth, 
 sea, and sky ; we feel his affection, in the 
 emotions which they raise 5 and, half 
 :/i.ortal, half etherealized, forget where 
 we are, in the anticipation of what that 
 world must be, of which this lovely earth 
 is merely the shadow. 
 
 «< Autumn seemed to be unfolding all 
 her beauties, to greet the return of the 
 Palatine. In one part, the hay-makers 
 were mowing the hay, and heaping it 
 into stacks ; in another, the reapers were 
 gathering up the wheat ; with a troop 
 of rosy little gleaners behind them, each

 of whom might have tempted the proud- 
 est Palemon in Christendom, to have 
 changed her toil into * a gentler duty? 
 Such a landscape, intermingled with the 
 little farms of these honest people, whom 
 the philanthropy of Sobieski has rendered 
 free, (for it is a tract of his extensive 
 domains I am describing,) reminded me 
 of Somerset. Villages repose in the green 
 hollows of the vales j and cottages are 
 seen peeping from amidst the thick 
 umbrage of the woods, which cover 
 the face of the hills. The irregular 
 forms and thatched roofs of these simple 
 habitations, with their infant inhabitants 
 playing at the doors, composed such 
 lovely groups, that I wished for our dear 
 Mary's pencil and fingers, (for alas ! that 
 way mine are motionless !) to transport 
 them to your eyes.

 castellated, and stands in the midst of a 
 fortress, now burst upon my view. It

 mit of a hill that gradually slopes down 
 towards the Vistula, and borders to the 
 south the plain of Vola ; a spot long fa- 
 mous for the election of the kings of 
 Poland. On the north of the building 
 the earth is cut into natural ramparts, 
 which, rise in high succession, until they 
 reach the foundations of the palace, where 
 they terminate in a noble terrace. These 
 ramparts, covered with grass, overlook 
 the stone-outworks, and spread down 
 to the bottom of the hill j which being 
 clothed with fine trees and luxurant 
 underwood, forms such a rich and ver- 
 dant base to the fortress as I have not 
 language to describe ; were I privileged 
 to be poetical, I would say, it reminds 
 me of the god of war, sleeping amid 
 roses in the bower of love. Here, the 
 eye may wander over the gifts of boun- 
 teous nature, arraying hill and dale in all 
 the united treasures of spring and au- 
 tumn. The forest stretches its yet un- 
 seared arms to the breeze ; whilst that

 breeze comes laden with the fragrance 
 of the tented hay, and the thousand 
 sweets breathed from flowers, which, in 
 this deHcious country, weep honey. 
 
 " A magnificent flight of steps led us 
 from the foot of the ramparts, up to the 
 gate of the palace. We entered it ; and 
 were presently surrounded by a train of 
 attendants in such sumptuous liveries, 
 that I found myself all at once carried 
 back into the fifteenth century ; and 
 might have fancied myself within the 
 courtly halls of our Tudors and Planta- 
 genets. You can better conceive, than 
 I can paint, the scene which took place 
 between the Palatine, the Countess, and 
 her son. I can only repeat, that from 
 that hour I have known no want of 
 happiness ; but what arises from regret 
 that my dear family are not partakers 
 with me. 
 
 " You know that this stupendous 
 building was the favourite residence of 
 John Sobieski j and that he erected it

 as a resting place from the labours of 
 his long and glorious reign. I cannot 
 move without meeting some vestige of 
 that truly great monarch. I sleep in his 
 bed-chamber : there hangs his portrait, 
 dressed in the robes of sovereignty ; 
 here, are suspended the arms with which 
 he saved the very kingdoms which have 
 now met together to destroy his country. 
 On one side, is his library ; on the other, 
 the little chapel in which he used to 
 pay his morning and evening devotions. 
 Wherever I look, my eye finds some ob- 
 ject to exite my reflections and emula- 
 tion. The noble dead seem to address 
 me from their graves ; and I blush at the 
 inglorious life I might have pursued, had 
 I never visited this house and its inhabit- 
 ants. Yet, my dearest mother, I do not 
 mean to reproach you ; nor to insinuate 
 that my revered father, and brave ances- 
 tors, have not set me examples as bright 
 as man need follow ; but human nature

 mulated by what is always in our view, 
 as with sights, which rising up when we 
 are removed from our customary asso- 
 ciations, surprise and captivate our at- 
 tention. Villanow has only awakened 
 me to the lesson, which I conned over 
 in drowsy carelessness at home. Thad- 
 deus Sobieski is hardly one year my se- 
 nior ! but, good heaven ! what has he not 
 done ? What has he not acquired ? Whilst 
 I abused the indulgence of my parents, 
 and wasted my days in riding, shooting, 
 and walking the streets, he was learning 
 to act as became a man of rank and 
 virtue ; and by seizing every opportunity 
 to serve the state, he has obtained a rich 
 reward in the respect and admiration of 
 his country. I am not envious, but I 
 now feel the truth of Caesar's speech, 
 when he declared, * the reputation of 
 Alexander would not let him sleep.* 
 Nevertheless, I dearly love my friend. 
 I murmur at my own demerits, not at his 
 worth.

 Palatine presented himself, and told me,

 and fit for nothing better than to hold 
 pins at my lady's toilet. Well, it is now 
 made evident to me, that we never know 
 the blessings of existence until we are 
 separated from the possession of them. 
 Absence tightens the string which unites 
 friends, as well as lovers ; at least, I find 
 it so ; and though I am in the fruition of 
 every good on this side the ocean, yet 
 my happiness renders me ungrateful ; 
 and I repine, because I enjoy it alone.

 his frank and glowing conversation is 
 directed to every rank of people. They 
 imbibe it with an avidity and love, which 
 makes its way to his heart without awaken- 
 ing his vanity. Thus, whilst his fine per-

 the interest he excites.

 her, I would die ; for her only, I would 
 wish to live.' Whilst he spoke, the 
 energy of his soul blazed in his eyes : I 
 smiled. 
 
 ** * You are an enthusiast, Thaddeus.' 
 
 " * Pembroke!' returned he, in a sur- 
 prised and reproachful tone. 
 
 " ' I do not give you^that name, oppro- 
 briously,' resumed I, laughing; * but 
 there are many in my country, who, 
 hearing these sentiments, would not 
 scruple to call you mad.'

 " * Then I pity them,' returned Thad- 
 deus. * Men who cannot ardently feel, 
 cannot taste supreme happiness. My 
 grandfather educated me at the feet of 
 patriotism ; and when I forget his pre- 
 cepts and example, may my guardian 
 angel forget me !' 
 
 " ' Happy, glorious, Thaddeus !' cried 
 I, grasping his hand ; « how I envy you 
 your destiny ! — To live as you do, in the 
 lap of honour ; virtue and glory, the aim 
 and end of your existence !' 
 
 *' The animated countenance of my 
 friend changed at these words, and laying 
 his hand on my arm, he said, * Do not 
 envy me my destiny. Pembroke, you are

 to invade its rights. Your King, in 
 happy security, reigns in the hearts of 
 his people; whilst our anointed Sta- 
 nislaus is baited and insulted, by oppres- 
 sion from without, and ingratitude with- 
 in. Do not envy me : I would rather

 live in obscurity all my days, than have 
 the means which calamity has bestowed, 
 of acquiring celebrity over the ruins of 
 Poland. O ! my friend, the wreath that 
 crowns the head of conquest is thick and 
 bright ; but that which binds the olive of 
 peace on the bleeding wounds of my 
 country will be the dearest to me.' 
 
 "Such sentiments, my dear madam, 
 have opened new lights upon my poor 
 mistaken faculties. I did not consider 
 the subject so maturely as my friend has 
 done ; victory and glory were with me 
 synonymous words. I had not learnt, until 
 frequent conversations with the young, 
 ardent, and pious Sobieski taught me, 
 how to discriminate between ferocity and 
 valour ; between the patriot and the 
 assassin ; between the defender of his 
 country, and the ravager of other states. 
 In short, I see in Thaddeus Sobieski all 
 that my fancy hath ever pictured of the 
 heroic character. Whilst I contemplate 
 the subUmity of his sentiments, and the

 tenderness of his soul, I cannot help 
 thinking, how few would believe that so 
 many admirable qualities could belong 
 to one mind ; and yet that mind remain 
 unacquainted with the throes of ambition 
 or the throbs of vanity." 
 
 Pembroke judged rightly of his friend ; 
 for if ever the real, disinterested amor 
 patrice glowed in the breast of a man, it 
 animated the heart of the young Sobieski. 
 At the termination of the foregoing sen- 
 tence in the letter to his mother, Pem- 
 broke was interrupted by the entrance of 
 a servant, who presented him a packet, 
 which had that moment arrived from 
 Petersburgh. He took it, and laying his 
 writing materials into a desk, read the 
 following epistle from his governor. 
 
 ** To Pembroke Somerset, Esq, 
 
 ** My dear Sir, 
 " I have this day received your letter, 
 enclosing one for Lady Somerset. You 
 must pardon me, that I have detained it ;

 and will continue to do so until I am 
 favoured with your answer to this ; for 
 which I shall most anxiously wait. 
 
 " You know, Mr. Somerset, my repu- 
 tation in the sciences j you know my 
 depth in the languages ; and besides, the 
 Marquis of Inverary, with whom I tra- 
 veiled over the Continent, offered you 
 sufficient credentials respecting my know- 
 ledge of the world, and the honourable 
 manner in which I treat my pupils. Sir 
 Robert Somei^set, and your lady mother, 
 were amply satisfied with the account, 
 which His Lordship gave of my character ; 
 but with all this, in one point every man 
 is vulnerable. No scholar can forget 
 those lines of the poet, 
 
 Felices ter, et amplius, 
 
 Quos irrupta tenet copula ; nee malis 
 Divulsus quaerimoniis, 
 
 Suprema citius solvet amor die. 
 
 It has been my misfortune that I have 
 felt them. 
 
 " You are not ignorant, that I was 
 known to the Branicki family, when I

 had the honour of conducting the Mar- 
 quis through Russia. The Count's ac- 
 compHshed kinswoman, the amiable and 
 learned widow of Baron SurowkofF, even 
 then took particular notice of me : and 
 when I returned with you to St. Peters- 
 burgh, I did not find that my short ab- 
 sence had obliterated me from her me- 
 mory. 
 
 " You are well acquainted with the 
 dignity of that lady's opinions, on political 
 subjects. She and I coincided in ardour 
 for the cause of insulted Russia ; and in 
 hatred of that leveUing power which per- 
 vades all Europe. Many have been the 
 long and interesting conversations we 
 have held on the prosecution of those 
 schemes, which her late husband had so 
 principal a hand in laying, for the sub- 
 version of the miserable kingdom in 
 which you now are. 
 
 " The Baroness, I need not observe, is 
 as handsome as she is ingenious ; her un- 
 derstanding is as masculine, as her person

 is desirable ; and I had been more, or less 
 than man, if I had not understood that 
 my figure and talents were agreeable to 
 her. I cannot say that she absolutely 
 promised me her hand, but she went as 
 far that way as delicacy would permit. I 
 am thus circumstantial, Mr. Somerset, to 
 show you that I do not proceed without 
 proof. She has repeatedly said in my 
 presence that she would never marry any 
 man, unless he were not only well-look- 
 ing, but of the profoundest erudition, 
 united with an acquaintance with men 
 and manners, which none could dispute. 
 * Besides,' added she, ' he must not 
 differ with me one tittle in politics ; for 
 on that head I hold myself second to no 
 m.an or woman in Europe.' And then 
 she has complimented me, by declaring, 
 that I possessed more judicious senti- 
 ments on government, than any man in 
 St. Petersburgh ; and that she should 
 consider herself happy on the first vacancy 
 in the Imperial College, to introduce me

 at court ; where she was sure the Empress 
 would at once discover the value of my 
 talents : ' but/ she continued, * in such 
 a case, I will not allow, that even Her 
 Majesty shall rival me in your esteem.' 
 The modesty natural to my character, 
 told me these praises must have some 
 other source than my comparatively une- 
 qual abilities ; and I unequivocally found 
 it in the partiality with which Her Lady- 
 ship condescended to regard me. 
 
 " Was I to blame, Mr. Somerset? Would 
 not any man of sensibility and honour 
 have comprehended such advances from 
 a woman of her rank and reputation ? I 
 could not be mistaken, her looks and 
 words needed no explanation, which my 
 judgment could not pronounce. Though 
 I am aware, that I do not possess that 
 lumen purpureum juventce which attracts 
 very young, uneducated women, yet I 
 am not much turned of fifty ; and from 
 the Baroness's singular behaviour, I had 
 every reason to expect handsomer treat-

 raent than she has been pleased to dis- 
 pense to me since my return. 
 
 " But to proceed regularly ; (I must 
 beg your pardon for the warmth which has 
 hurried me to this digression,) you know. 
 Sir, that from the hour in which I had the 
 honour of taking leave of your noble 
 family in England, I strove to impress 
 upon your rather volatile mind, a just 
 and accurate conception of the people 
 amongst whom I was to conduct you. 
 When I brought you into this extensive 
 empire, I left no means unexerted to 
 heighten your respect, not only for its 
 amiable sovereign, but for all regal 
 powers. It is the characteristic of genius 
 to be zealous : I was so, in favour of the 
 pretensions of the great Catharine, to 
 that paltry country in which you now are, 
 and to which she deigned to offer her 
 protection. To this zeal, and my unfor- 
 tunate, though honourable devotion to 
 the wishes of the Baroness, I am con- 
 strained to date my present dilemma.

 ** When Poland had the insolence to 
 rebel against its illustrious mistress, you 
 remember, that every man of rank in St. 
 Petersburgh was highly incensed. The 
 Baroness Surowkoff declared herself fre- 
 quently, and with vehemence ; she ap- 
 pealed to me ; my veracity and my prin- 
 ciples were called forth, and I confessed, 
 that I thought every friend to the Tza- 
 ritza ought to take up arms against that 
 ungrateful people. The Count Branicki 
 was then appointed to command the 
 Russian forces ; and Her Ladyship, very 
 unexpectedly on my part, answered me, 
 by approving what I said ; and saying, 
 that of course I meant to follow her 
 cousin into Poland ; for that even she, 
 as a woman, was so earnest in the cause, 
 she would accompany him to the fron- 
 tiers, and there await the result. 
 
 " What could I do ? How could I 
 withstand the expectations of a lady of 
 her quality, and one who, I believed, 
 loved me? However, for some time I

 did oppose my wish to oblige her ; I 
 urged my cloth ; and the impossibility 
 of accounting for such a line of con- 
 duct to the father of my pupil? The 
 Baroness ridiculed all these arguments, 
 as mere excuses : and ended with say- 
 ing, ' Do as you please, Mr. Loftus. I 
 have been deceived in your character ; 
 the friend of the Baroness SurowkofF 
 must be consistent ; he must be as will- 
 ing to fight for the cause he espouses 
 as to speak for it ; in this case, the sword 
 must follow the oration, else we sjiall see 
 Poland in the hands of a rabble.' 
 
 " This decided me. I offered my ser- 
 vices to the Count, to attend him to the 
 field. He, and the young lords, per- 
 suaded you to do the same; and as I 
 could not think of leaving you, when 
 your father had placed you under my 
 charge, I was pleased to find that my 
 approval confirmed your wish to turn 
 soldier. I was not then acquainted, 
 Mr. Somerset, (for you did not tell me of

 it until we were far advanced into Po- 
 land,) with Sir Robert's and my Lady's 
 dislike of the army. This has been a 
 prime source of my error 5 had I known 
 their repugnance to your taking up 
 arms, my duty would have triumphed 
 over even my devotion to the Baroness : 
 but I was born under a melancholy horo- 
 scope ; nothing happens as any one of 
 my humblest wishes might warrant. 
 
 " At the first onset of the battle, I 
 became so suddenly ill, I was obliged to 
 retire; and on this unfortunate event, 
 which was completely unwilled on my 
 part, (for no man can command the pe- 
 riods of sickness,) the Baroness founds 
 a contempt which has disconcerted all 
 my schemes. Besides, when I attempted 
 to remonstrate with Her Ladyship on the 
 promise which, if not directly given, was 
 implied, she laughed at me j and when I 
 persisted in my suit, all at once, like the 
 rest of her ungrateful, undistinguishing 
 sex, she burst into a tempest of invec- 
 tives, and forbade me her house.

 " What am I now to do, Mr. Somer- 
 set? This inconsistent woman has be- 
 trayed me into a conduct diametrically 
 opposite to the commands of your fa- 
 mily. Your father particularly desired 
 that I would not suffer you to go either 
 into Hungary or Poland. In the last 
 instance I have permitted you to disobey 
 him. And my Lady Somerset, (who lost 
 both her father and brother in diiSferent 
 engagements,) you tell me, hath declared 
 that she never would pardon the man who 
 should put mihtary ideas into your head. 
 " Therefore, Sir, though you are my 
 pupil, I throw myself on your generosity. 
 If you persist in acquainting your family 
 with the late transactions at Zielime, and 
 your present residence in Poland, I shall 
 finally be ruined. I shall not only for- 
 feit the good opinion of your father and 
 mother, but lose all prospect of the liv-

 so gracious as to promise should be mine

 support depends on my success in life ; 
 if my preferment be stopped now, they 
 must necessarily be involved in a distress 
 which makes me shudder. 
 
 " I cannot add more, Sir ; I know 
 your generosity ; and I therefore rest 
 upon it. I shall detain the letter, which 
 you did me the honour to inclose for my 
 Lady Somerset, till I receive your deci- 
 sion ; and ever, whilst I live, will I hence- 
 forth remain firm to my old and favourite 
 maxim, which I adopted from the glo- 
 rious epistle of Horace to Numicius. 
 Perhaps you may not recollect the lines ? 
 They run thus :

 "P. S. Just as I was sealing this 
 packet, the EngUsh ambassador for- 
 warded to me a short letter from your 
 father, in which he desires us to quit 
 Russia ; and to make the best of our 
 way to England, where you are wanted 
 on a most urgent occasion. He explains 
 himself no farther ; only repeating his 
 orders in express commands that we set 
 off instantly. I wait your directions." 
 
 This epistle disconcerted Mr. Somer- 
 set. He always guessed the Baroness 
 SurowkofF was amusing herself with his 
 vain and pedantic preceptor ; but he 
 never entertained a suspicion that Her 
 Ladyship would carry her pleasantry to 
 so cruel an excess. He clearly saw that 
 the fears of Mr. Loftus, with regard to 
 the displeasure of his parents, were far 
 from groundless ; and therefore, as there 
 was a probability from the age of Dr. 
 Manners, that the rectory of Somerset 
 would soon become vacant, he thought 
 it better to oblige his poor governor, and

 than to give him up to the indignation 
 of Sir Robert On these grounds, Pem- 
 broke resolved to write to Mr. Loftus, 
 and ease the anxiety of his heart. Al- 
 tJiough he ridiculed his vanity, he could 
 not help respecting the affectionate soli- 
 citude of a son and a brother ; and, as 
 that plea had won him, half angry, half 
 grieved, and half laughing, he dispatched 
 a few hasty lines.

 withheld the letter which I sent to you 
 to forward to my mother ! You offer far- 
 fetched, and precious excuses, for having 
 betrayed your own wisdom, and your 
 pupil's innocence, into so mortal an 
 offence. One cause of my being here 
 you say was your * ardour in the cause

 " Well, I grant it. I understood from 
 you and Branicki, that you were leading 
 me against a set of violent, discontented 
 men of rank, who, in proportion as they 
 were inflated with personal pride and in- 
 solence, despised their own order ; and 
 under the name of freedom, were intro- 
 ducing anarchy throughout a country 
 which Catharine would graciously have 
 protected. All this I find is false. But 
 both of you may have been misled ; the 
 Count by partiality ; and you by misre-

 mands of his father, an immediate change

 was produced in the spirits of the party. 
 During the lamentations of the ladies 
 and the murmurs of the young men, the 
 Countess tried to dispel the effects of 
 the information, by addressing Pem- 
 broke with a smile, and saying, " But 
 we hope that you have seen enough at 
 Villanow, to tempt you back again at 
 no very distant period ? Tell Lady So- 
 merset you have left a second mother 
 in Poland, who will long to receive an- 
 other visit from her adopted son." 
 
 " Yes, my dear Madam," returned 
 he ; " and I shall hope before a very dis- 
 tant period to see those two kind mo- 
 thers united as intimately by friendship, 
 as they are in my heart." 
 
 Thaddeus listened with a saddened coun- 
 tenance. He had not been accustomed 
 to disappointment ; and when he met it 
 now, he hardly knew how to proportion 
 his uneasiness to the privation. Hope 
 and all the hilarities of youth flourislied 
 in his soul ; his features continually

 glowed with animation, whilst the gay 
 beaming of his eyes ever answered to 
 the smile on his lips. Hence the slight- 
 est veering of his mind was perceptible 
 to the Countess, who turning round, saw 
 him leaning thoughtfully in his chair; 
 whilst Pembroke, with increasing ve- 
 hemence, was running through various 
 invectives against the hastiness of his 
 recall. 
 
 " Come, come, Thaddeus !" cried 
 she, " let us think no more of this 
 separation until it arrives. You know 
 that anticipation of evil is the death 
 of happiness ; and it will be a kind of 
 suicide, should we destroy the hours 
 we may yet enjoy together, in vain 
 complainings they are so soon to ter- 
 minate.'* 
 
 A little exhortation from the Coun- 
 tess, and a maternal kiss which she im- 
 printed on his cheek, restored him to 
 cheerfulness ; and the evening past away 
 pleasanter than it had portended.

 Much as the Palatine esteemed Pem- 
 broke Somerset, his mind was too deeply 
 absorbed in the losses of his country, to 
 attend to less considerable cares. He 
 beheld his country, even on the verge of 
 destruction, awaiting with firmness the 
 approach of the earthquake which was 
 to ingulph it in the neighbouring nations. 
 He saw the storm lowering ; but he de- 
 termined, whilst there remained one spot 
 of vantage ground above the general 
 wreck, that Poland should yet have a name 
 and a defender. These thoughts pos- 
 sessed him ; these plans engaged him 5 
 and he had not leisure to regret pleasure, 
 when he was struggling for existence. 
 
 The Empress continued to pour her 
 armies into the heart of the kingdom. 
 The King of Prussia, boldly flying from 
 his treaties, refused it his succour ; and 
 the Emperor of Germany, following the 
 example of so great a Prince, did not 
 blush to show that his word was equally 
 contemptible.

 Dispatches daily arrived, of the villages 
 being laid waste : that neither age, sex, 
 nor situation prevented their unfortu- 
 nate inhabitants becoming the victims of 
 cruelty; and that all the frontier pro- 
 vinces were in flames. 
 
 The Diet was called, and the debates 
 agitated with the anxiety of men,^ who 
 were met to decide on their dearest in- 
 terests. The bosom of the benevolent 
 Stanislaus bled at the dreadful picture of 
 his people's sufferings ; and hardly able 
 to restrain his tears, he answered the 
 animated exordiums of Sobieski for re- 
 sistance to the last, with an appeal im- 
 mediately to his heart. 
 
 " What is it that you urge me to do, 
 my Lord ?" said he. " Was it not to 
 secure the happiness of my subjects, that 
 I laboured ? and finding my design im- 
 practicable, what advantage would it be 
 to them, should I pertinaciously oppose 
 their small numbers, to the accumulated 
 hordes of the north? What is my kingdom,

 but the comfort of my people? What 
 will it avail me, to see them fall around 
 me, man by man ; and the few who re- 
 main, hanging in speechless sorrow over 
 their graves ? Such a sight would break 
 my heart. Poland without its people, 
 would be a desart ; and I a hermit rather 
 than a King." 
 
 In vain the Palatine combated this 
 argument, and the quiet which a peace 
 would aftbrd, by declaring it could only 
 be temporary. In vain he told His 
 Majesty, that he would purchase safety 
 for the present race, at the vast expense 
 of not only the liberty of posterity, but 
 of its probity and happiness. 
 
 ** However you disguise slavery," cried 
 he, " it is slavery still. Its chains, though 
 wreathed with roses, not only fasten on 
 the body but rivet on the mind. They 
 bend it from the loftiest virtue, to a de- 
 basement beneath calculation. They dis- 
 grace honour ; they trample upon justice. 
 They transform the legions of Rome

 into a band of singers. They prostrate 
 the sons of Athens and of Sparta at 
 the feet of cowards. They make man 
 abjure his birthright, bind himself to 
 another's will, and give that into a 
 tyrant's hands, which he received as a 
 deposit from heaven — his reason, his 
 conscience, and his soul. Think on this, 
 and then, if you can, subjugate Poland 
 to her enemies." 
 
 Stanislaus, weakened by years, and sub- 
 dued by disappointment, now retained no 
 higher wish than to save his subjects from 
 immediate outrage. He did not answer 
 the Palatine ; but with streaming eyes, 
 bent over the table, and annulled the 
 glorious constitution of 1791. Then with 
 emotions hardly short of agony, he signed 
 an order presented by a Russian officer, 
 which directed Prince Poniatowski to 
 deliver the army under his command into 
 the hands of General Branicki. 
 
 As the King put his signature to these 
 papers, Sobieski, who had strenuously 
 withstood each decision, started from his

 chair, bowed to his sovereign, and in 
 silence left the apartment. Several no- 
 blemen followed him. 
 
 These pacific measures did not meet 
 with better treatment from without. 
 When they were noised abroad, an alarm- 
 ing commotion arose amongst the inha- 
 bitants of Warsaw ; and nearly four thou- 
 sand men of the first families in the king- 
 dom assembled themselves in the park of 
 Villanow, and with tumultuous eagerness, 
 declared their resolution to resist the 
 power of their combined ravagers to the 
 utmost. The Prince Sapieha, Kosciuszko, 
 and Sobieski, were the first who took the 
 oath of eternal fidelity to Poland ; and 
 they administered it to Thaddeus, who 
 kneeling down, called on heaven to hear 
 him, as he swore to assert the freedom 
 of his country to the last gasp of its 
 existence. 
 
 In the midst of these momentous af- 
 fairs, Pembroke Somerset bade adieu to 
 his friends; and set sail with his go- 
 vernor from Dantzic for England.

 cheerfulness and festivity, now rolled 
 away in the sad pomp of national debates 
 and military assemblies. 
 
 Prussia usurped the best part of Pome- 
 relia, and garrisoned it with troops ; 
 Catharine declared her dominion over 
 the vast tract of land which lies between 
 the Dwina and Borystenes ; and Frederic 
 William marked down another sweep of 
 Poland, to follow the fate of Dantzic and 
 of Thorn. 
 
 Calamities, insults, and robberies, were 
 heaped, day after day, on the defenceless 
 Poles. The Deputies of the provinces 
 were put into prison ; and the Russian 
 ambassador had the insolence, even to

 interrupt provisions intended for the 
 King's table, and appropriate them to 
 his own. Sobieski remonstrated on this 
 outrage; but incensed at reproof, and 
 irritated at the sway which the Palatine 
 still held at court, he issued an order 
 for all the Sobieski estates in Lithuania 
 and Podolia to be sequestrated, and di- 
 vided between four of the Russian ge- 
 nerals. 
 
 In vain the Villanow confederation en- 
 deavoured to remonstrate with the Em- 
 press. Her ambassador, not only refused 
 to forward the dispatches, but threatened 
 the nobles, *' if they did not comply with 
 every one of his demands, he would lay all 
 the estates, possessions, and habitations, 
 of the members of the Diet under an 
 immediate military execution. Nay, 
 punishment should not stop there ; for if 
 the King joined the Sobieski party, (to 
 which he now appeared inclined,) the 
 royal domains should not only meet the 
 same fate, but harsher treatment should

 follow, until both the people, and their 
 proud Sovereign, were brought into sub- 
 jection." 
 
 These menaces were too arrogant, to 
 have any other effect upon the Poles, than 
 that of giving a new spur to their resolu- 
 tion. With the same firmness, they re- 
 pulsed similar fulminations from the 
 Prussian ambassador ; and with a cool- 
 ness which was only equalled by their 
 intrepidity, they prepared to resume 
 their arms. 
 
 Hearing by private information that 
 his threats were despised, next morning 
 before day-break the insolent Russian 
 surrounded the building were the con- 
 federation was sitting, with two battalions 
 of grenadiers and four pieces of cannon ; 
 and then issued orders, that no Pole 
 should pass the gates without being fired 
 on. General Rautenfeld, who was set 
 over the person of the King, declared 
 that not even His Majesty should stir, 
 until the Diet had given an unanimous

 and full consent to the Empress's com- 
 mands. 
 
 The Diet set forth the unlawfulness of 
 signing any treaty, whilst thus withheld 
 from the freedom of will and debate. 
 They urged that it was not legal to enter 
 into deliberation, when violence had re- 
 cently been exerted against any individual 
 of their body ; and how could they do it 
 now, deprived as they were of five of 
 their principal members, whom the am- 
 bassador well knew he had arrested in 
 their way to the senate ? Sobieski and 
 four of his friends, being the members 
 most inimical to the wishes of Russia, 
 were these five. In vain their liberation 
 was required; and enraged at the per- 
 tinacity of this opposition, Rautenfeld 
 repeated his former threatenings with the 
 addition of more ; swearing they should 
 take place without appeal, if the Diet 
 did not, directly and unconditionally, sign 
 the pretensions both of his court, and 
 that of Prussia.

 After a hard contention of many hour^, 
 at last the members agreed amongst them- 
 selves, to make a solemn public protest 
 against the present tyrannous measures of 
 the Russian ambassador 5 and seeing that 
 any attempt to inspire him even with 
 decency was useless, they determined to 
 cease all debate, and keep a profound 
 silence when the marshal should propose 
 the project in demand. 
 
 This sorrowful silence was commenced 
 in resentment, and retained through des- 
 pair ; this sorrowful silence was called 
 by their usurpers a consent ; this sorrow- 
 ful silence is held up to the world, and to 
 posterity, as a free cession of the Poles, 
 of all those rights, which they had re- 
 ceived from nature, and defended with 
 their blood. 
 
 The morning after this dreadful day 
 the senate met at one of the private 
 palaces : and indignant, and broken- 
 hearted, they delivered the following de- 
 claration to the people :

## p. 145 (#167) ############################################


 
 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. ] 45 
 
 " The Diet of Poland, hemmed in by 
 foreign troops, menaced with an invasion, 
 which would be attended by universal 
 ruin, and finally insulted by a thousand 
 outrages, have been forced to witness 
 the signing of a treaty with Prussia. 
 
 ** They strenuously endeavoured to 
 add to that treaty, some conditions to 
 which they supposed the lamentable 
 state of this country would have ex- 
 torted an acquiescence, even from the 
 heart of power. But the Diet were de- 
 ceived : they found, that power was un- 
 accompanied by humanity : they found, 
 that Prussia, having thrown his victim 
 to the ground, would not refrain from 
 exulting in the barbarous triumph of 
 trampling upon her neck. 
 
 " The Diet rely on the justice of Po- 
 land ; rely on her beUef, that they would 
 not betray the citadel she confided to 
 their keeping ; her preservation is dearer 
 to them than their lives ; but fate seems 
 to be on the side of their destroyer.

 Fresh insults have been heaped upon 
 their heads, and new hardships have 
 been imposed upon them. To prevent 
 all deliberations on this debasing treaty, 
 they are not only surrounded by foreign 
 troops, and dared with hostile messages, 
 but they have been violated by the arrest 
 of their prime members; whilst those 
 who are still suffered to possess a per- 
 sonal freedom, have the most galling 
 shackles laid upon theu' minds. 
 
 " Therefore, I, the King of Poland, 
 enervated by age, and sinking under the 
 accumulated weight of afflictions ; — and 
 also, we, the members of the Diet, — de- 
 clare, that being unable, even by the sa- 
 crifice of our lives, to relieve our country 
 from the yoke of its oppressors, we con- 
 sign it to posterity. 
 
 " In another age, means may be 
 found to rescue it from chains and mi- 
 sery ; but such means are not in our 
 power. Other countries neglect us ; 
 whilst they reprobate the violations

 which a neighbouring nation is alleged 
 to have committed against rational li- 
 berty, they behold not only with apathy 
 but with approbation, the ravages which 
 are desolating Poland. Posterity must 
 avenge it ; we have done. We accede, 
 for the reasons above mentioned, to the 
 treaty laid before us ; though we declare, 
 that it is contrary to our wishes, to our 
 sentiments, and to our rights." 
 
 Thus, in November, 1793, — compress- 
 ed to one-fourth of her dimensions, 
 within the lines of demarcation drawn 
 by her enemies, — Poland was stripped 
 of her rank in Europe : the lands of her 
 nobles given to strangers ; and her citi- 
 zens left to perish in chains. Ill-fated 
 nation ! Posterity will weep over thy 
 wrongs ; whilst the burning blush of 
 shame, that their fathers witnessed such 
 wrongs unmoved, shall cause the tears 
 to blister as they fall. 
 
 During these transactions, the Coun- 
 tess Sobieski continued in solitude at

 Villanow, awaiting with awful anxiety 
 the termination of those portentous 
 events, which so deeply involved her 
 own comforts with those of her country. 
 Her father was in prison, her son at a 
 distance with the army. Sick at heart, 
 she saw the opening of that spring, 
 which might be the commencement 
 only, of a new season of injuries : and 
 her fears were prophetic. 
 
 Those soldiers who had dared to retain 
 their arms in their hands, were again or- 
 dered by the Russian ambassador to lay 
 them down. Some few^ thinking denial 
 vain, obeyed ; but bolder spirits followed 
 Thaddeus Sobieski into South Prussia; 
 whither he had directed his steps on the 
 arrest of his grandfather ; and where he 
 had gathered, and kept together, a 
 handful of brave men still faithful to 
 their liberties. His name alone collected 
 numbers in every district through which 
 he marched. Persecution from their 
 advei^ary, as well as admiration of

 Thaddeus, gave a resistless power to his 
 appearance, look, and voice ; all which 
 had such an effect on the people, they 
 crowded to his standard by hundreds ^ 
 whilst their lords, having caught a simi- 
 lar fire from the ardour of the young 
 Count, committed themselves without 
 reserve to his sole judgment and com- 
 mand. The Empress, hearing of this, 
 ordered Stanislaus to command him to 
 disband his troops. But the King re- 
 fusing, she augmented the strength of 
 her own forces ; and enraged at so stub- 
 born a resistance, renewed the war witli 
 redoubled horrors. 
 
 The Palatine remained in confinement, 
 hopeless of obtaining release without the 
 aid of stratagem. The emissaries of 
 Catharine were too well aware of their 
 interest to give freedom to so active an 
 opponent. They loaded him with irons 
 and insult ; — but in spite of their arts 
 this patriotic victim to vindictive tyranny 
 received every consolation which can

 soothe a brave man, (his own arms being 
 tied from serving his- country,) in the in- 
 formation which the bKnd maHce of his 
 jailors hourly brought to his ears. They 
 told him, " that his grandson continued 
 to carry himself with such insolent op- 
 position in the south, it would be well if 
 the Empress, at the termination of the 
 war, allowed him to escape with eternal 
 banishment to Siberia." Every reproach 
 which was levelled at the Palatine, he 
 found had been bought by some new 
 conquest of Thaddeus ; and instead of 
 permitting their malignity to intimidate 
 his age, or alarm his affection, he told 
 the officer, (whose daily office was to at- 
 tend and to torment him,) that — if his 
 grandson were to lose his head for fide- 
 lity to Poland, he should behold him, 
 with as proud an eye, mounting the 
 scaffiDld, as entering the streets of War- 
 saw with Russia at his chariot wheels. 
 " The only difference would be,'' con- 
 tinued Sobieski, " that, as the first can-

 not happen until all virtue be dead in 
 this land, I should regard his last gasp 
 as the expiring sigh of that virtue, which, 
 by him, had found a triumph even under 
 the axe. And for the second, — it would 
 be joy unutterable, to behold the victory 
 of justice over rapine and murder! But, 
 either way, Thaddeus Sobieski is still the 
 same ; ready to die, or ready to live, for 
 his country — and equally worthy of the 
 eternal halo, with which posterity will 
 encircle his name." 
 
 Indeed the accounts which arrived 
 from this young soldier, who had formed 
 a junction with General Kosciuszko, were 
 in the highest degree formidable to the 
 coalesced powers. Having gained seve- 
 ral advantages over the Prussians, his 
 troops were advancing towards Inow- 
 lotz, when a large and fresh body of the 
 enemy appeared closely on their rear. 
 The fugitives on the opposite bank of 
 the river, (whom the Poles were driving 
 before them,) at sight of this reinforce-

 ment suddenly rallied; and to retard 
 the approach of their pursuers, and en- 
 sure their defeat from the army in view, 
 they broke down the wooden bridge by 
 which they might have escaped. The 
 Poles were at a stand. Kosciuszko pro- 
 posed swimming across ; but owing to 
 the recent heavy rains the river was so 
 swoln and rapid that the young men to 
 whom he mentioned the project, terrified 
 by the blackness and dashing of the 
 water, drew back. The General per- 
 ceiving their panic, called Thaddeus to 
 him, and both plunged into the stream. 
 Ashamed of hesitation, the others now 
 tried who could first follow their exam- 
 ple ; and after hard buffeting with the 
 waves the whole army gained the oppo- 
 site shore. The Prussians who were in 
 the rear, incapable of the like intrepidity, 
 halted ; and those in the van, intimi- 
 "Sated at the daring courage of their ad- 
 versaries, concealed themselves amidst 
 the thickets of an adjoining valley.

 The two friends proceeded towards 
 Cracow, carrying redress and protection 
 to the provinces through which they 
 marched. But they had hardly rested 
 two days in that city before dispatches 
 were received, that Warsaw was lying at 
 the mercy of General Branicki. No 
 time could be lost, officers and men had 
 set their lives on the cause ; and they re- 
 commenced their toils, with a persever- 
 ance which brought them before the ca- 
 pital on the I6th of April. 
 
 Things were in a worse state than 
 even was expected. The Russian am. 
 bassador, with his usual arrogance, had 
 not only demanded the surrender of the 
 national arsenal ; but subscribed his or- 
 ders with a threat, that whoever of the 
 nobles presumed to dispute his authority 
 should be arrested and put to death ; 
 and if the people should dare to murmur, 
 he would immediately command General 
 Branicki to lay the city in ashes.

 The King remonstrated against such 
 oppression ; and to " punish his pre- 
 sumption,''^ this proper representative of 
 the Imperial Catharine, ordered that His 
 Majesty's garrison and guards should be 
 instantly broken and dispersed. At the 
 first attempt to execute this mandate, 
 the people flew in crowds to the palace ; 
 and falling on their knees, implored 
 Stanislaus for permission to avenge the 
 insult offered to his troops. His Ma- 
 jesty looked at them with pity, gratitude, 
 and anguish ; for some time his emotions 
 were too strong to allow him to speak ; 
 at last in a voice of agony, which was 
 wrung from his tortured heart, he an- 
 swered, " Go, and defend your honour 1" 
 
 The army of Kosciuszko marched into 
 the town at this critical moment ; they 
 joined the armed citizens ; and that day, 
 after a dreadful conflict, Warsaw was 
 rescued from the immediate grasp of 
 Russia. During the fight, the King,

 who was alone in one of the rooms of 
 his palace, sunk almost fainting on the 
 floor ; he heard the mingling clash of 
 arms, the roar of musquetry, and the 
 cries and groans of the combatants ; 
 ruin seemed no longer to hover over his 
 kingdom, but to have pounced at once 
 upon her prey. At every renewed vol- 
 ley, which followed each pause in the fir- 
 ing, he expected to see his palace-gates 
 burst open, and himself^ then indeed 
 made a willing sacrifice to the fury of his 
 enemies. 
 
 Whilst he was yet upon his knees, pe- 
 titioning the God of battles for a little 
 longer respite from that doom, which was 
 to overwhelm devoted Poland — Thad- 
 deus Sobieski, panting with heat and toil, 
 flew into the room ; and before he could 
 speak a word, was clasped in the arms of 
 the agitated Stanislaus. 
 
 " Are my people safe ?" asked the 
 King.

 " And victorious !" returned Thad- 
 deus. " The foreign guards are beaten 
 from the palace ; — your own have re- 
 sumed their station at the gates." 
 
 At this assurance tears of joy ran over 
 the venerable cheeks of His Majesty ; 
 and again embracing his young deliverer, 
 he exclaimed, " I thank Heaven, my un- 
 happy country is not bereft of all hope ! 
 Whilst Kosciuszko and a Sobieski live, 
 she will not quite despair."

 Thaddeus was not less eager to release 
 his grandfather, than he had been to 
 relieve the anxiety of his sovereign. 
 He hastened at the head of a few troops 
 to the prison of Sobieski, and gave him 
 liberty amidst the acclamations of his 
 soldiers. 
 
 The universal joy at these prosperous 
 events did not last many days : it was 
 speedily terminated by information, that 
 Cracow had surrendered to a Prussian 
 force ; the King of Prussia was advanc- 
 ing towards the capital ; and that the 
 Russians, more implacable, in conse- 
 quence of the late treatment their gar- 
 rison had received at Warsaw, were 
 pouring into the country like a deluge.

 At this intelligence, the consternation 
 became dreadful. The Polonese army, 
 worn with fatigue and long services, and 
 without clothing or ammunition, were 
 not in any way, excepting courage, fitted 
 for the field. 
 
 The treasury was exhausted ; and 
 means of raising a supply, seemed im- 
 practicable. The provinces vere laid 
 waste, and the city had already been 
 drained of its last ducat. In this exigency, 
 a council met in His Majesty's cabinet, 
 to devise some expedient for obtaining 
 resources. The consultation was as de- 
 sponding as their situation, until Thad- 
 deus Sobieski, who had been a silent 
 observer, rose from his seat. Sudden in- 
 disposition had prevented the Palatine 
 attending, but his grandson knew well 
 how to be his substitute. Whilst blushes 
 of awe and eagerness crimsoned his 
 cheek, he advanced towards Stanislaus ; 
 and taking from his neck, and other 
 parts of his dress, those magnificent

 jewels it was customary to wear in the 
 presence of the King, he knelt down, 
 and laying them at the feet of His Ma- 
 jesty, said in a suppressed voice, " These 
 are trifles ; but such as they are, and all 
 of the like kind which I possess, I be- 
 seech Your Majesty to appropriate to the 
 public service/' 
 
 " Noble young man!" cried the King, 
 raising him from the ground ; " you have 
 indeed taught me a lesson : I accept these 
 jewels with gratitude. Here," said he, 
 turning to the treasurer, «« put them 
 into the national fund; and let them be 
 followed by my own, with my plate ; 
 which latter, I desire may be instantly 
 sent to the mint. One half, the army 
 shall have ; the other w^e must expend 
 in giving some little support to the 
 surviving families of the brave men who 
 have fallen in our defence." The Pa- 
 latine readily united with his grandson, 
 in the surrender of all their personal 
 property, for the benefit of their country:

 and according to their example, the 
 treasury was soon filled with gratuities 
 from the nobles. The very artisans 
 offered their services gratis ; and, all 
 hands being employed to forward the 
 preparations, the army was soon enabled 
 to take the field, newly equipped, and in 
 high spirits. 
 
 The Countess had again to bid adieu 
 to a son, who was now become as much 
 the object of her admiration, as of her 
 love. In proportion as glory surrounded 
 him, and danger courted his steps, the 
 strings of affection drew him closer to 
 her soul : the " aspiring blood" of the 
 Sobieskis, which beat in her veins, could 
 not drown the feelings of a parent; could 
 not cause her to forget, that the spring 
 of her existence now flowed from the 
 fountain, which had taken its source from 
 her. Her anxious and waiting heart paid 
 dearly in tears and sleepless nights, for 
 the honour with which she was saluted at; 
 every turning, as the mother of Thaddeus :

 that Thaddeus, who was not more the 
 spirit of enterprise, and the rallying 
 point of resistance, than he was to her, 
 the gentlest, the dearest, the most amia- 
 ble of sons. It matters not to the un- 
 <listinguishing bolt of carnage, whether 
 it strike common breasts, or those rare 
 hearts, w^hose lives are usually as brief 
 as they are dazzling j this leaden mes- 
 senger of death, banquets as greedily on 
 the bosom of a hero, as if it had lit 
 upon more vulgar prey : all is levelled 
 to the chance of war j which comes like 
 a whirlwind of the desert, scattering man 
 and beast in one wide ruin. 
 
 Such thoughts as these possessed the 
 melancholy reveries of the Countess So- 
 bieski, from the hour in which she saw 
 Thaddeus and his grandfather depart for 
 Cracow, until she heard that it was re- 
 taken, and that the enemy were defeated 
 in many battles.

 again Kosciuszko, with the Palatine, and

 Thaddeus, preserved it from destruction. 
 In short, wherever they moved, this 
 dauntless httle army carried terror to 
 their adversaries ; and diffused hope 
 through the homes and hearts of their 
 countrymen. 
 
 They next turned their course to the 
 rehef of Lithuania ; but whilst they were 
 on their route thither, they received in- 
 telligence that a detachment from their 
 body having been beaten by the Russians 
 under Suwarrow, that General, elated 
 with success, was hastening forwards, to 
 re-attack the capital. 
 
 Kosciuszko, resolved to prevent him, 
 prepared to give immediate battle to 
 Ferfen, another Russian commander, 
 who was on his march to form a junction 
 with his victorious countrymen. To this 
 effect, Kosciuszko divided his forces: 
 half of them, under the command of 
 Prince Poniatowski, were to pursue 
 Suwarrow, and keep a watchful eye over 
 his motions ; whilst Kosciuszko, accom-

 panied by the two Sobieskis, would pro- 
 ceed with the remainder towards Brzesc. 
 
 It was the tenth of October. The 
 weather being fine, a cloudless sun dif- 
 fused life and brilliancy through the pure 
 air of a keen morning. The vast green 
 plain before them glittered with the 
 troops of General Ferfen, who had al- 
 ready arranged them in order of battle. 
 
 The word was given. Thaddeus, as 
 he drew his sabre from his scabbard, 
 raised his eyes to implore the justice of 
 Heaven on that day's events. The attack 
 was made. The Poles kept their station 
 on the heights. Twice the Russians 
 rushed on them like wolves, and twice 
 they repulsed them by their steadiness. 
 Conquest declared for Poland. Thad- 
 deus was seen in every part of the field. 
 But reinforcements poured in to the 
 support of Ferfen, and war raged in new 
 liorrors. Still the courage of the Poles 
 was unabated. Sobieski, fighting at the 
 head of the infantry, would not recede

 one foot : and Kosciuszko, exhorting his 
 men to be resolute, appeared in the hot- 
 test places of the battle. 
 
 At one of these portentous moments, 
 the commander-in-chief was seen strug- 
 gling with the third charger, which had 
 been shot under him that day. Thaddeus 
 galloped to his assistance, and giving him 
 his horse, mounted another which was 
 offered by a soldier ; and remained fight- 
 ing by his side, till on the next charge, 
 Kosciuszko himself fell on the neck of 
 his horse. Thaddeus caught him in his 
 arms ; and finding that his breast was 
 immediately covered with blood (a Cossac 
 having stabbed the General in the back), 
 he unconsciously uttered a groan of hor- 
 ror. The surrounding soldiers took the 
 alarm, and " Kosciuszko, our General, is 
 killed !" was echoed from rank to rank 
 with such piercing shrieks, that the 
 wounded hero started from the breast of 
 his young friend, just as two Russian 
 chasseurs, in the same moment, made a

 cut at them both. The sabre struck the 
 exposed head of Kosciuszko, who fell 
 senseless to the ground ; and Thaddeus 
 received a gash in his shoulder that laid 
 him by his side. 
 
 The consternation became universal ; 
 groans of despair seemed to issue from 
 the whole army, whilst the few resolute 
 Poles who had been stationed near the 
 fallen General, fell in mangled heaps 
 upon his breast. Thaddeus with diffi- 
 culty extricated himself from the bodies 
 of the slain ; and fighting his way through 
 the triumphant troops which pressed 
 around him, he joined his terror-stricken 
 comrades ; who, in the wildest confusion, 
 were dispersing under a heavy fire, and 
 flying like frighted deer. In vain he 
 called to them ; in vain he urged them 
 to avenge Kosciuszko ; the panic was 
 complete, and they fled. 
 
 Almost alone, in the rear of his soldiers, 
 he opposed with his single and desperate 
 arm, party after party of the enemy, until

 a narrow stream of the Muchavez stopped 
 his retreat. The waters were crimsoned 
 with blood. He plunged in, and beating 
 the blushing wave with his left arm, in a 
 few seconds gained the opposite bank ; 
 where, fainting from fatigue and loss of 
 blood, he sunk, almost deprived of sense, 
 amidst a heap of the killed. 
 
 When the pursuing squadrons had 
 galloped by him, he again summoned 
 strength to look around. He raised him- 
 self from the ground, and by the help of 
 his sword, supported his steps a few 
 paces farther : but, good God ! what was 
 the shock he received, when the bleed- 
 ing and lifeless body of his grandfather 
 lay before him ? He stood for a few mo- 
 ments, motionless, and without sensation ; 
 then, kneeling down by his side, whilst 
 he felt as if his own heart were palsied 
 with death, he searched for the wounds 
 of the Palatine. They were numerous 
 and deep. He would have torn away the 
 handkerchief with which he had staunch-

 ed his own blood to have appUed it to 
 that of his grandfather, but by so 
 doing he must have disabled himself from 
 giving him farther assistance. He took 
 his sash and neck-cloth, and when they 
 were insufficient, he rent the linen from 
 his breast ; then hastening to the river, 
 he brought a little water in his cap, and 
 threw some of its stained drops on the 
 pale features of Sobieski. 
 
 The venerable hero opened his eyes : 
 in a minute afterwards he recognized, 
 that it was his grandson who knelt by 
 him. The Palatine pressed his hand, 
 which was cold as ice : the marble lips of 
 Thaddeus could not move. 
 
 *« My son," said the veteran in a low 
 voice, " Heaven hath led you hither, to 
 receive the last sigh of your grandfather." 
 Thaddeus trembled ; the Palatine con- 
 tinued, " Carry my blessing to your 
 mother ; and bid her seek comfort in the 
 consolations of her God. May that God 
 preserve you ! ever remember that you

 are his servant ; be obedient to him ; 
 and as I have been, be faithful to your 
 country." 
 
 " May God so bless me !" cried Thad- 
 deus, looking up to Heaven. 
 
 ** And ever remember," said the Pala- 
 tine, raising his head, which had dropt 
 on the bosom of his grandson, " that you 
 are a Sobieski ! it is my dying command, 
 that you never take any other name." 
 
 *' I promise." 
 
 Thaddeus could say no more, for the 
 countenance of his grandfather became 
 altered ; his eyes closed. Thaddeus 
 caught him to his breast. No heart beat 
 against his ; all was still and cold. The 
 body dropped from his arms, and he sunk 
 senseless by its side. 
 
 When sensation returned to him, he 
 looked up. The sky was shrouded in 
 clouds, which a driving wind was blow- 
 ing from the orb of the moon, as a few 
 of her white rays here and there gleamed

 on the weapons of the slaughtered sol- 
 diers. 
 
 The scattered senses of Thaddeus 
 slowly recollected themselves. He was 
 now lying, the only living creature, 
 amidst thousands of the dead, who, the 
 preceding night, had been like himself, 
 alive to all the consciousness of existence ! 
 His right hand rested on the chilled face 
 of his grandfather, it was wet with dew; 
 he shuddered ; and taking his own cloak 
 from his shoulders, laid it over the body. 
 He would have said as he did it, " So, 
 my father, I would have sheltered thy 
 life, with my own!" but the words 
 choked in his throat, and he sat watching 
 by the corpse, until the day dawned, and 
 the Poles returned to bury their slain. 
 
 The wretched Thaddeus was discovered 
 by a party of his own hussars, seated on 
 a little mound of earth, with the cold 
 hand of Sobieski grasped in his. At this 
 sight the soldiers uttered a cry of horror. 
 Thaddeus rose up : ** My friends," said

 he, " I thank God that you are come ! 
 Assist me to bear my dear grandfather 
 to the camp." 
 
 Astonished at this composure, but dis- 
 tressed at the deathful hue of his coun- 
 tenance, they obeyed him in mournful 
 silence ; and laid the remains of the 
 Palatine upon a bier, which they fonned 
 with their sheathed sabres ; then gently 
 raising it, they retrod their steps to the 
 camp ; leaving a detachment to accom- 
 plish the duty for w^iich they had quitted 
 it. Thaddeus, hardly able to support his 
 weakened frame, mounted a horse, and 
 fbllow^ed the melancholy procession. 
 
 General Wawrzecki, on whom the 
 command had devolved, seeing the party 
 returning so soon, and in such an order, 
 sent an aid-de-camp to enquire the reason. 
 He came back with dejection in his face; 
 and informed the commander, that the 
 brave Palatine of Masovia, whom they 
 supposed had been taken prisoner with 
 his grandson and Kosciuszko, was the

 occasion of this sudden return ; that he 
 had been killed, and was now approach- 
 ing the lines on the arms of his soldiers. 
 Wawrzecki, though glad to hear that 
 Thaddeus was alive and at liberty, turned 
 to conceal his tears ; then calling out a 
 guard, he marched at their head to meet 
 the corpse of his illustrious friend. 
 
 The bier was carried into the General's 
 tent. An aid-de-camp and some gentle- 
 men of the faculty, were ordered to 
 attend Thaddeus to his quarters; but the 
 young Count, though scarcely able to 
 stand, appeared to linger ; and holding 
 fast by the arm of an officer, he looked 
 stedfastly on the body. Wawrzecki un- 
 derstood his hesitation. He pressed his 
 hand; "Fear not, my dear Sir," said he; 
 <* every honour shall be paid to the re- 
 mains of your noble grandfather." Thad- 
 deus bowed his head, and was supported 
 out of the tent to his own. 
 
 His wounds, of whicli he had received 
 several, were not deep ; and might have

 been of little consequence, had not his 
 thoughts continually hovered about his 
 mother, and painted her affliction, when 
 she should be informed of the lamentable 
 events of the last day's battle. These 
 reflections, awake, or in a slumber (for 
 he never slept), possessed his mind ; and 
 even whilst his wounds were healing, 
 produced such an irritation in his blood, 
 as hourly threatened a fever. 
 
 Things were in this situation, when 
 the surgeon put a letter from the Coun- 
 tess into his hand. He opened it, and 
 read with breathless anxiety, these lines : 
 
 ** To TJiaddeuSy Count SohiesM. 
 " Console yourself my most precious 
 son, console yourself for my sake. I 
 have seen Colonel Lomza; and I have 
 heard all the horrors which took place 
 on the tenth of this month. I have 
 heard them, and I am yet alive ; I am re- 
 signed ; but he tells me you are wounded.

 sainted father's darUng : remember, that 
 as his representative, you are to be my 
 consolation : in pity to me, if not to our 
 suffering country, preserve yourself^ to 
 be at least the last comfort which Hea- 
 ven will spare to me. I find, that all is 
 lost to Poland, as well as to myself; 
 that when my glorious father fell, and 
 his friend with him, the republic became 
 extinct. The Russian army is now on 
 its march towards Masovia ; and I am 
 too weak to come to you. Let me see 
 you soon, very soon, my beloved son ; 
 I beseech you come to me. You will 
 find me feebler in body, than in mind ; 
 for there is a holy comforter that de- 
 scends on the bruised heart, which none 
 other than the unhappy have conceived 
 or felt. Farewell, my dear, dear Thad- 
 deus ! Let the memory, that you have a 
 mother, check your too ardent courage.

 mother ; who has no stronger words to

 she is thy mother ; — thy 
 
 " Therese C. Sobieski." 
 «* VillanoWj 
 October, 1794.'-' 
 
 This letter was indeed a balm to the 
 soul of Thaddeus. That his mother had 
 received intelligence of the cruel event 
 with such resignation, was the best me- 
 dicine that could now be applied to his 
 wounds, both of mind and body ; — and 
 when he was told, that on the succeed- 
 ing morning the body of his grandfather 
 w^ould be removed to the convent near 
 Biala, he declared his resolution to 
 attend it to the grave. 
 
 In vain his surgeons and General 
 Wawrzecki remonstrated against the 
 danger of this project ; for once the 
 gentle and yielding spirit of Thaddeus 
 was inflexible. He had fixed his deter- 
 mination, and it was not to be shaken. 
 
 Next day, being the seventh from

 that in which the fatal battle had been 
 decided, Thaddeus, at the first beat of 
 the drum, rose from his bed, and almost 
 unassisted put on his clothes. His uni- 
 form being black, he needed no other 
 index than his pale and mournful coun- 
 tenance, to announce that he was chief 
 mourner. 
 
 The procession began to form, and 
 he walked from his tent. It was a fine 
 morning : Thaddeus looked up, as if to 
 upbraid the sun for shining so brightly. 
 Lengthened and repeated rounds of can- 
 non rolled along the air. The solemn 
 march of the dead was moaning fi'om the 
 muffled drum, interrupted at measured 
 pauses by the shrill tremor of the M^. 
 The troops, preceded by their General, 
 moved forward with a decent and me- 
 lancholy step. The Bishop of Warsaw 
 followed, bearing the sacred volume in 
 his hands ; and next, borne upon the 
 crossed pikes of his soldiers, and sup- 
 ported by twelve of his veteran compa-

 nions, appeared the body of the brave 
 Sobieski. A velvet pall covered it, on 
 which were laid those arms, with which 
 for fifty years he had asserted the liber- 
 ties of his country. At this sight, the 
 sobs of the men became audible. Thad- 
 deus followed with a slow but firm step, 
 his eyes bent to the ground, and his 
 arms wrapped in his cloak : it was the 
 same which had shaded his beloved 
 grandfather from the dews of that dread- 
 ful night. Another train of solemn mu- 
 sic succeeded ; and then the squadrons, 
 which the deceased had commanded, 
 dismounted, and leading their horses, 
 closed the procession. 
 
 On the verge of the plain that borders 
 Biala, and within a few paces of the con- 
 vent gate of St. Francis, the bier stopped. 
 The monks saluted its appearance with 
 a requiem, which they continued to 
 chant till the coffin was lowered into the 
 ground. The earth received its sacred 
 deposit. The anthems ceased : and the

 soldiers kneeling down, discharged their 
 muskets over it ; then, with stream- 
 ing cheeks, rose, and gave place to 
 others. Nine vollies were fired, and 
 the ranks fell back. The Bishop ad- 
 vanced to the head of the grave ; all 
 was hushed ; he raised his eyes to 
 Heaven ; then, after a pause, in which 
 he seemed to be communing with the 
 regions above him, he turned to the 
 silent assembly, and in a voice, collected 
 and impressive, addressed them in a short, 
 but affecting oration, in which he set 
 forth the brightness of Sobieski's life ; 
 his noble forgetfulness of selfi in the in- 
 terests of his country ; and the dauntless 
 bravery, which had laid him in the dust. 
 — A general discharge of cannon and 
 of musquetry, was the awful response to 
 this appeal. Wawrzecki took the sword 
 of the Palatine, and breaking it, dropt it 
 into the grave. The aides-de-camp of 
 the deceased did the same by theirs ; 
 showing, that by so doing, they resigned

 their offices ; and then covering theii' 
 faces with their handkerchiefs, they 
 turned away with the soldiers who filed 
 off. Thaddeus sunk on his knees : his 
 hands were clasped, and his eyes for a 
 few minutes fixed themselves on the 
 coffin of his grandfather; then rising, 
 he leaned on the arm of Wawrzecki, and 
 with a tottering step and pallid counte- 
 nance mounted his horse, which had been 
 led to the spot ; and returned with the 
 scattered procession to the camp. 
 
 The cause for exertion being over, his 
 spirits fell with the rapidity of a spring 
 too highly wound up, which snaps, and 
 runs down to immobility. He entered 
 his tent, and threw himself on the bed, 
 from which he did not arise, for the ^ve 
 following days.

 CHAP. IX. 
 
 At a time when the effects of these 
 sufferings and fatigues had brought him 
 very low, the young Count Sobieski was 
 aroused by information that the Russians 
 had planted themselves before Prague, 
 and were preparing to bombard the 
 town. This intelligence rallied the spi- 
 rits of the depressed soldiers, who readily 
 obeyed their commander, to put them- 
 selves in order of march the next day. 
 Thaddeus saw the decisive blow was 
 pending ; and though hardly able to sit 
 his horse, he refused the indulgence of a 
 litter ; determining that no illness, w^hile 
 he had power to master its effects, should 
 make him recede one hour from the 
 active exercise of his duty. 
 
 Devastation was spread over the face 
 of the country. As the troops moved,

 the unhappy and houseless villagers, pre- 
 sented an agonizing picture to their view. 
 Old men stood amongst the ashes of their 
 homes, deploring the cruelty of power ; 
 children and women sat by the way-side, 
 weeping over the last sustenance, which 
 the wretched infant drew from the breast 
 of its perishing mother. 
 
 Thaddeus shut his eyes on the scene. 
 
 «* O, my country ! my country !" ex- 
 claimed he, " what are my personal 
 griefs to thine ? It is your wretchedness 
 that barbs me to the heart! Look there," 
 cried he, to the soldiers, pointing to the 
 miserable spectacles before him, " look 
 there, and carry vengeance into the breasts 
 of their destroyers. Let Prague be the 
 last act of this tragedy !" 
 
 Unhappy young man, unfortunate 
 country ! It was indeed the last act of 
 a tragedy, to which all Europe were 
 spectators ; a tragedy, which the nations 
 witnessed without one attempt to stop 
 or to delay its dreadful catastrophe ! O !

 how must virtue be lost, when it is no 
 longer an article of policy, even to as- 
 sume it ! 
 
 After a long march through a dark 
 and dismal night, the morning began to 
 break : and Thaddeus found himself on 
 the southern side of that little river 
 which divides the territories of Sobieski 
 from the woods of Kobylka. Here, for 
 the first time, he endured all the tortur- 
 ing varieties of despair. 
 
 The once fertile fields were burnt to 
 stubble ; the cottages were yet smoking 
 from the ravages of the fire; and in 
 place of smiUng eyes and thankful lips, 
 he beheld the dead bodies of his pea- 
 sants, stretched on the high roads, 
 mangled, bleeding, -and stripped of that 
 decent covering, which humanity would 
 not deny to the vUest criminal. 
 
 Thaddeus could bear the sight no 
 longer ; but setting spurs to his horse, 
 fled from the contemplation of scenes 
 which harrowed up his heart.

 182 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 At night-fall, the army halted under 
 the walls of Villanow. The Count 
 looked towards the windows of the pa- 
 lace, and by a light shining through the 
 half-drawn curtains, distinguished his 
 mother's room. He then turned his 
 eyes on that sweep of building which 
 contained the Palatine's apartments ; 
 but not one solitary lamp illumined its 
 gloom ; the moon alone glimmered on 
 the battlements; silvering the painted 
 glass of the study window, where, with 
 that beloved parent, he had so lately 
 gazed upon the stars ; and anticipated a 
 campaign, which had now so fatally ter- 
 minated. 
 
 These thoughts, with his grief) and 
 his forebodings, were buried in the 
 depths of his soul. Addressing General 
 Wawrzecki, he bade him welcome to 
 Villanow ; requesting at the same time, 
 that the men might be directed to rest 
 till the morning; and that he, and the

 officers, would partake of refreshment 
 within the palace. 
 
 As soon as Thaddeus saw his guests 
 seated at different tables in the eating- 
 hall, and had given orders for the sol- 
 diers to be served from the cellars, he 
 withdrew to seek the Countess. He 
 found her in her dressing-room, sur- 
 rounded by the attendants who had just 
 informed her of his arrival. The mo- 
 ment he appeared at the door, the wo- 
 men went out at an opposite passage, 
 and Thaddeus with an anguished heart 
 threw himself on the bosom of his mo- 
 ther. They were silent for some time. 
 Poignant recollection stopped their ut- 
 terance : but neither tears nor sighs 
 filled its place, until the Countess — on 
 whose soul the full tide of maternal affec- 
 tion pressed, and mingled with her grief, 
 — raised her head from her son's neck, 
 and said, whilst she strained him in her 
 arms ; *« Receive my thanks, O ! Father

 of Mercy, for having spared to me this 
 blessing !" 
 
 Sobieski breathed a response to the 
 address of his mother : and drying her 
 tears with his kisses, dwelt upon the 
 never-dying fame of his beloved grand- 
 father; upon his preferable lot to that 
 of their brave friend Kosciuszko, who 
 was doomed, not only to survive the 
 liberty of his country, but to pass the 
 residue of his life within the dungeons of 
 a Russian prison. He then tried to re- 
 animate her spirits with hope. He spoke 
 of the approaching battle, without ex- 
 pressing any doubt of the valour and 
 desperation of the Poles rendering it 
 successful. He talked of the firmness 
 of the King ; of the courage of the Ge- 
 neral; of his own resolution. His dis- 
 course began in a wish to cheat her into 
 tranquillity ; but as he advanced on the 
 subject, his soul took fire at its own 
 warmth, and he half believed the proba- 
 bility of his anticipations.

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 185 
 
 The Countess looked on the honour- 
 able glow which crimsoned his harassed 
 features, with a pang at her heart. 
 
 " My heroic son !" cried she, " my 
 darling Thaddeus ! what a vast price do I 
 pay for all this excellence ! I could not 
 love you, were you otherwise than what 
 you are ; and being what you are, O ! 
 how soon may I lose you ! Already has 
 your noble grandfather paid the debt 
 which he owed to his glory : he promised 
 to fall with Poland; he has kept his 
 word ; and now, all that I love on earth 
 is concentrated in you.'' The Countess 
 paused, and pressing his hand almost 
 wildly on her heart, she continued in a 
 hurried voice ; " The same spirit is in 
 your breast; the same principle binds 
 you; and I may at last be left alone. 
 Heaven have pity on me !" 
 
 She cast her eyes upwards as she ended. 
 Thaddeus, sinking on his knees by her 
 side, implored her with all the earnestness 
 of piety and confidence, to take comfort.

## p. 186 (#208) ############################################


 
 186 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 The Countess embraced him with a forced 
 smile; "You must forgive me, Thad- 
 deus, I have nothing of the soldier in 
 my heart ; it is all woman. But I will 
 not detain you longer from the rest you 
 require ; go to your room, and try to 
 recruit yourself for the dangers to- 
 morrow will bring forth. I shall employ 
 the night in prayers for your safety." 
 
 Consoled to see any composure in his 
 mother, he withdrew, and after having 
 heard that his numerous guests were pro- 
 perly lodged, went to his own chamber. 
 
 Next morning at sun-rise the troops 
 prepared to march. General Wawrzecki 
 with his officers, begged permission to pay 
 their personal gratitude to the Countess, 
 for the hospitality of her reception ; but 
 she declined the honour, on the plea of 
 indisposition ; and in the course of an 
 hour the Count appeared from her apart- 
 ment, and joined the General. 
 
 The soldiers filed off through the 
 gates J crossed the bridge; and halted

 under the walls of Prague. The lines of 
 tlie camp were drawn, and fortified, be- 
 fore the evening ; at which time they 
 found leisure to observe the enemy's 
 strength. 
 
 Russia seemed to have exhausted her 
 wide regions to people the narrow shores 
 of the Vistula ; from east to west, as far 
 as the eye could reach, her armies were 
 stretched to the horizon. Sobieski looked 
 at them, and then on the handful of in- 
 trepid hearts contained in the small cir- 
 cumference of the Polish camp. Sighing 
 heavily, he retired into his tent ; and 
 vainly seeking repose, mixed his short 
 and startled slumbers, with frequent 
 prayers for the preservation of these last 
 victims to their country. 
 
 The hours appeared to stand still. 
 Several times he rose from his bed, and 
 went to the door, to see whether the 
 clouds were tinged with any appearance 
 of dawn. All continued dark. He again 
 returned to his marquee, and standing by

 the lamp, which was nearly exhausted, 
 took out his watch, and tried to dis- 
 tinguish the points ; but finding that the 
 light burnt too feebly, he was presshig 
 the repeating spring, which struck five, 
 when the report of a single musket made 
 him start. 
 
 He flew to his tent door, and looking 
 around, saw that all in that quarter was 
 at rest. Suspecting it to be a signal of 
 the enemy, he hurried towards the en- 
 trenchments ; but found the centinels in 
 perfect security from any fears respect- 
 ing the sound, as they supposed it to 
 have proceeded from the town. 
 
 Sobieski paid little attention to their 
 opinions, but ascending the nearest bas- 
 tion to take a wider survey, in a few 
 minutes he discerned, though obscurely 
 through the gleams of morning, the 
 whole host of Russia advancing in pro- 
 found silence towards the Polish lines. 
 The instant he made this discovery, he 
 came down, and lost no time in giving

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 189 
 
 orders for a defence; then flying to 
 other parts of the camp, he awakened 
 the commander-m-chief, encouraged the 
 men, and saw that the whole encamp- 
 ment was not only in motion, but pre- 
 pared for the assault. 
 
 In consequence of these prompt arrange- 
 ments, the Russians were received with 
 the cross-fire of the batteries ; and case 
 shot and musketry from several redoubts, 
 which raked their flanks as they ap- 
 proached. But, in defiance of this shower 
 of bullets, they pressed on with an in- 
 trepidity worthy of a better cause ; and 
 overleaping the ditch by squadrons en- 
 tered the camp. A passage once secured, 
 the Cossacs rushed in by thousands ; and 
 spreading themselves in front of the 
 storming party, put every soul to the 
 bayonet who opposed their way. 
 
 The Polish works being gained, the 
 Russians turned the cannon on its former 
 masters; and as they rallied to the de- 
 fence of what remained, swept them

 down by whole regiments. The noise of 
 artillery thundered from all sides of the 
 camp : the smoke was so great, that it 
 was hardly possible to distinguish friends 
 from foes ; nevertheless, the spirits of 
 the Poles flagged not a moment : as fast 
 as one rampart was wrested from them, 
 they threw themselves within another ; 
 which was as speedily taken, by the help 
 of hurdles, fascines, ladders, and a 
 courage as resistless, as it was ferocious, 
 merciless, and sanguinary. Every spot of 
 vantage ground was at length lost ; and 
 yet the Poles fought like lions ; quarter 
 was neither offered to them nor required ; 
 they disputed every inch of way, until 
 they fell upon it in heaps ; some, lying 
 before the parapets ; others, filling the 
 ditches; and the rest covering the ground, 
 for the enemy to tread on, as they cut 
 their passage to the heart of the camp. 
 
 Sobieski, almost maddened by the 
 scene, dripping with his own blood, and 
 that of his brave friends, was seen in

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 191 
 
 every part of the action ; he was in the 
 fosse, defending the trampled bodies of 
 the dying; he was on the dyke, animating 
 the few who survived. Wawrzecki was 
 slain and every hope hung upon Thad- 
 deus ; his presence and voice infused 
 new energy into the arms of his fainting 
 countrymen : they kept close to his side, 
 until the Russians, enraged at the daunt- 
 less intrepidity of this young hero, 
 uttered the most unmanly imprecations, 
 and rushing on his little phalanx, at- 
 tacked it with redoubled numbers and 
 fury. 
 
 Sobieski sustained the shock with firm- 
 ness ; but wherever he turned his eyes, 
 they were blasted with some object 
 which made them recoil ; he beheld his 
 companions, and his soldiers, strewing 
 the earth ; and their barbarous adver- 
 saries mounting their dying bodies, as 
 they hastened with loud huzzas, to the 
 destruction of Prague, whose gates were 
 now burst open. His eyes grew dim at

 the sight; and at the very moment in 
 which he tore them from spectacles so 
 deadly to his heart, a Lavonian officer 
 struck him with a sabre, to all appearance 
 dead upon the field. 
 
 When Thaddeus recovered from the 
 blow, which, having lit on the steel of his 
 cap, had only stunned him, he looked 
 around, and found that all near him was 
 quiet ; but a far different scene presented 
 itself from the town. The roar of cannon, 
 and the bursting of bombs, thundered 
 through the air ; which was rendered 
 livid and tremendous by long spires of 
 fire, streaming from the burning houses, 
 and mingling with the volumes of smoke, 
 which rolled from the guns. The dread- 
 ful tocsin, and the hurras of the victors, 
 pierced the soul of the Count. Spring- 
 ing from the ground, he was preparing 
 to rush towards the gates, when loud 
 cries of distress issued from the interior 
 of the place, — and a moment after, the

 grand magazine blew up with a horrible 
 explosion. 
 
 In an instant the field before Prague 
 was filled with women and children, 
 flying in all directions, and rending the 
 sky with their shrieks. " Father Al- 
 mighty !" cried Thaddeus, wringing his 
 hands, " canst thou suffer this ?" Whilst 
 he yet spake, some straggling Cossacs, 
 from the town, who were prowling about, 
 glutted, but not sated with blood, seized 
 the poor fugitives, and with a ferocity as 
 wanton as unmanly, released them at 
 once from life and affliction. 
 
 This hideous spectacle brought his 
 mother's defenceless state before the 
 eyes of Sobieski. Her palace was only 
 four miles distant ; and whilst the barba- 
 rous avidity of the Russians was too 
 busily engaged in sacking the place, to 
 permit them to perceive a solitary in- 
 dividual hurrying away amidst heaps of 
 dead bodies, he flew across the deso-

 lated meadows which intervened between 
 Prague and Villanow. 
 
 Thaddeus was met at the gate of the 
 palace by General Butzou ; who having 
 learnt the fate of Prague from the noise 
 and flames in that quarter, anticipated 
 the arrival of some part of the victorious 
 army before the walls of Villanow. When 
 the Count crossed the draw-bridge, he 
 saw that the worthy veteran had pre- 
 pared every thing for a stout resistance ; 
 the ramparts were lined with soldiers, 
 and well mounted with artillery. 
 
 " Here, my dear Lord," cried he, as 
 he conducted the Count to the keep, 
 *« let the worst happen, here I am re- 
 solved to dispute the possession of your 
 grandfather's palace, until I have not a 
 man to stand by me !" 
 
 Thaddeus strained him in silence to 
 his breast ; and after examining the force 
 and dispositions, he approved all, with a 
 cold despair of their being of any effec-

 taal use ; and went to the apartments of 
 his mother. 
 
 The Countess's women, who met him 
 in the vestibule, begged him to be care- 
 ful how he entered Her Excellency's 
 room ; for she had only just recovered 
 from a swoon, occasioned by alarm at 
 hearing the cannonade against the Polish 
 camp. Thaddeus waited for no more ; 
 but regardless of their caution, threw 
 open the door of the chamber ; and 
 hastening to his mother's couch, cast 
 himself into her arms. She clung round 
 his neck : and for a while joy stopped 
 her respiration, till bursting into tears 
 she wept over him, incapable of express- 
 ing by w^ords her tumultuous gratitude of 
 again beholding him alive. He looked 
 on her altered and pallid features. 
 
 ** O ! my mother," cried he, clasping 
 her to his breast, " you are ill; and what 
 will become of you ?" 
 
 ** My beloved son," replied she, kissing 
 his forehead through the clotted blood

 which oozed from a cut on his temple; 
 " my beloved son, before our cruel mur- 
 derers can arrive, I shall have found a 
 refuge in the bosom of my God." 
 
 Thaddeus could only answer with a 
 groan. She resumed. " Give me your 
 hand. I must not witness the grandson 
 of Sobieski, given up to despair : let 
 your mother incite you to resignation. 
 You see, I have not breathed a com- 
 plaining word, although I behold you 
 covered with wounds." As she spoke, 
 her eye pointed to the sash and hand- 
 kerchief which were bound round his 
 thigh and arm, " Our separation will 
 not be long ; a few short years, perhaps 
 hours, may unite us for ever in a better 
 world." 
 
 The Count was still speechless ; he 
 could only press her hand to his lips. 
 After a pause, she proceeded. — 
 
 " Look up, my dear boy ! and attend 
 to me. Should Poland become the pro- 
 perty of other nations, I conjure you, if

 you survive its fall, to leave it. When 
 reduced to slavery, it will no longer be 
 an asylum for a man of honour. I be- 
 seech you, should this happen, go that 
 very hour to England : That is a free 
 country : and I have been told, the peo- 
 ple are kind to the unfortunate. Thad- 
 deus ! Why do you delay to answer me ? 
 Remember, these are your mother's 
 dying prayers." 
 
 " 1 will obey you." 
 
 " Then," continued she, taking from 
 her bosom a picture, " let me tie this 
 round your neck. It is the portrait of 
 your father." Thaddeus bent his head, 
 and the Countess fastened it under his 
 neckcloth : " Prize this gift, my child ; 
 it is likely to be all that you will now 
 inherit either from me, or that father. 
 Try to forget his injustice, my dear son ; 
 and in memory of me never part with it. 
 O, Thaddeus ! since the moment in 
 which I first received it, until this in- 
 stant, it has never been from my heart !"

 " And it shall never leave mine," an- 
 swered he, in a stifled voice, " whilst I 
 have being." 
 
 The Countess was preparing to reply, 
 when a sudden volley of fire-arms made 
 Thaddeus spring upon his feet. Loud 
 cries succeeded. Women rushed into 
 the apartment, screaming, " The ram- 
 parts are stormed !" and the next mo- 
 ment that quarter of the building rocked 
 to its foundation. The Countess clung 
 to the bosom of her son ; Thaddeus 
 clasped her close to his breast, and cast- 
 ing up his petitioning eyes to Heaven, 
 *< O God !" cried he, " can I not find 
 shelter for my mother !" 
 
 Another burst of cannon was followed 
 by a heavy crash, and the most piercing 
 shrieks echoed through the palace. ** All 
 is lost!" cried a soldier, who appeared 
 for an instant at the room door, and 
 vanished. 
 
 Thaddeus, overwhelmed with despair, 
 grasped his sword, which had fallen to

 the ground, and crying, " Mother, we 
 will die together!" would have given her 
 one last and assuring embrace, when his 
 eyes met the dreadful sight of her before 
 agitated features, now tranquillized in 
 death. She fell from his palsied arms 
 back on the sofa, and he stood gazing on 
 her, as if struck by a power which had 
 benumbed all his faculties. 
 
 The tumult in the palace encreased 
 every moment ; but he heard it not, until 
 Butzou, followed by two or three of his 
 soldiers, ran into the apartment, calling 
 out, ** Count, save yourself!'* 
 
 Sobieski still remained motionless. The 
 General caught him by the arm, and 
 covering the body of the deceased Coun- 
 tess with the mantle of her son, hurried 
 his unconscious steps, by an opposite 
 door, through the state chambers into the 
 gardens. 
 
 Thaddeus did not recover his recollec- 
 tion until he reached the outward gate ; 
 then breaking from the hold of his friend,

 was returning to the sorrowful scene he 
 had left, when Butzou, aware of his in- 
 tentions, just stopped him time enough 
 to prevent his rushing on the bayonets of 
 a party of Russian infantry who were 
 pursuing them at full speed. 
 
 The Count now rallied his distracted 
 faculties ; and making a stand with the Ge- 
 neral and his three Poles, they compelled 
 this merciless detachment to seek refuge 
 among the arcades of the building. 
 
 Butzou would not allow his young Lord 
 to pursue the wretches, but hurried him 
 across the park. He looked behind him ; 
 a column of fire issued from the south 
 towers. Thaddeus sighed as if his life 
 were in that sigh ; ** All is indeed over ;" 
 and pressing his hand to his forehead, in 
 that attitude followed the steps of the 
 General towards the Vistula. 
 
 From the wind's being very high, the 
 flame spread itself over the roof of the 
 palace ; and catching at every combusti- 
 ble in its way, the Russians became so

 terrified at the quick progress of a fire 
 wliich threatened to consume themselves 
 as well as their plunder, that they quitted 
 it with precipitation ; and descrying the 
 Count and his soldiers at a little distance, 
 directed all their malice to that point. 
 Speedily overtaking the brave fugitives, 
 they blocked up the bridge by a file of 
 men with fixed pikes ; and not only me- 
 naced the Polanders as they advanced, 
 but derided their means of resistance. 
 
 Sobieski, indifferent alike to danger 
 and to insults, stopped short to the left, 
 and follow^ed by his friends, plunged into 
 the stream amidst a shower of musket 
 balls from the enemy. After hard buffet- 
 ing with the torrent, lie at last reached 
 the opposite bank ; and was assisted from 
 the river by some of the weeping inha- 
 bitants of Warsaw ; who had been watch- 
 ing the expiring ashes of Prague, and 
 the flames which were feeding on the 
 boasted towers of Villanow.

 Emerged from the water, Thaddeus 
 stood to regain his breath 5 and leaning 
 on the shoulder of Butzou, he pointed to 
 his burning palace with a smile of agony, 
 "See what a funeral pile. Heaven has 
 given to the manes of my dear mother !" 
 
 The General did not speak, for grief 
 stopped his utterance; but motioning 
 the two soldiers to proceed, he supported 
 the Count into the citadel.

 CHAP. X. 
 
 TROM the termination of this awful day, 
 in which a brave and virtuous people 
 were consigned to slavery, Thaddeus was 
 confined to his apartment in the garrison. 
 
 It was now the latter end of November. 
 General Butzou supposing that the illness 
 of his lord might continue some weeks, 
 and aware that no time ought to be lost 
 in maintaining all that was yet left of 
 the kingdom of Poland, obtained his per- 
 mission ; and quitting Warsaw, joined 
 Prince Poniatowski, who was yet at the 
 head of a few troops near Sachoryn. 
 
 Not long afterwards, the young Count 
 finding himself tolerably restored, ex- 
 cept in those wounds of the heart, which 
 time only can heal, was enabled to leave 
 his room, and breathe the fresh air on the

 ramparts. His appearance was greeted 
 by the officers, with melancholy congra- 
 tulations ; but their replies to his eager 
 questions, displaced the faint smile which 
 he tried to spread over his countenance ; 
 and with a contracted brow, he listened 
 to the following information. 
 
 Prague was not only razed to the 
 ground : but upwards of thirty thousand 
 persons, besides old men, women, and 
 defenceless infants, had perished by the 
 sword, the river, and the flames. All 
 the horrors of Ismail were re-acted by 
 Suwarrow on the banks of the Vistula. 
 The citizens of Warsaw, intimidated bv 
 such a spectacle, assembled in a body, 
 and driven to desperation, repaired to 
 the foot of the throne. On their knees 
 they implored His Majesty to forget the 
 contested rights of his subjects ; and in 
 pity to their wives and children, allow 
 them by a timely submission, to save 
 those dear relatives from the ignominy 
 and cruelty which had been wreaked

 upon the inhabitants of Prague. Sta- 
 nislaus saw that opposition would be 
 fruitless. The walls of his capital were 
 already surrounded by a train of artillery, 
 ready to blow the town to atoms ; the fate 
 of Poland seemed inevitable : and with a 
 deep sigh the King assented to the pe- 
 tition, and sent deputies to the enemy's 
 camp.- 
 
 "Suwarrow," continued the officer, 
 ** demands that every man in Poland 
 shall not only surrender his arms, but sue 
 for pardon for the past. This is his re- 
 ply to the submission of the King, and 
 these hard conditions are accepted." 
 
 " They never shall be by me," said 
 Sobieski ; and turning from his informer, 
 hardly knowing what were his intentions, 
 he walked towards the royal palace. 
 
 When His Majesty was apprized that 
 the young Count Sobieski aw^aited his 
 commands in the audience chamber, he 
 left his closet, and entered the room. 
 Thaddeus with a swelling heart would

 have thrown himself on his knee, but 
 the King prevented him and pressed him 
 with emotion in his arms. 
 
 " Brave young man !" cried he, " I 
 embrace in you the last of those Polish 
 youth, who were so lately the brightest 
 jewels in my crown." 
 
 Tears stood in the monarch's eyes, as 
 he spoke; and Sobieski, with hardly a 
 steadier utterance, answered, " I come 
 to receive Your Majesty's commands. I 
 will obey them in all things, but in sur- 
 rendering this sword (which was my 
 grandfather's) into the hands of your 
 enemies." 
 
 " I will not desire you, my noble 
 friend," replied Stanislaus ; "by my ac- 
 quiescence with the terms of Russia, I 
 comply only, with the earnest prayers of 
 my people; I do not wish them to be 
 slaves. I shall not ask you to betray 
 your country; but alas! you must not 
 throw away your life in a now hopeless 
 cause. Fate has consigned Poland to sub-

 jection ; and when Heaven in its all-wise 
 though mysterious decrees confirms the 
 destruction of kingdoms, man's duty 
 is resignation. For myself, I am ordered 
 by our conqueror to bury my griefs and 
 indignities in the castle of Grodno." 
 
 The blood rushed over the cheek of 
 Thaddeus at this meek declaration, to 
 which the proud indignation of his soul 
 could in no way subscribe ; with a heated 
 and agitated voice, he exclaimed, " If my 
 Sovereign be already at the command of 
 our oppressors, then indeed is Poland no 
 more ! and I have nothing to do, but to 
 perform the dying will of my mother. 
 Will Your Majesty grant me permission 
 to set off for England, before I can be 
 obliged to witness the last calamity of 
 my wretched country ?" 
 
 " I would to Heaven," replied the 
 King, " that I, too, might repose my age 
 and sorrows in that happy kingdom ! Go, 
 Sobieski j my prayers and blessings shall 
 follow you."

 208 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 Thaddeus pressed His Majesty's hand 
 to his lips. 
 
 " Beheve me, my dear Count," con- 
 tinued Stanislaus, "my soul bleeds at 
 this parting. I know the treasure which 
 your family has always been to this na- 
 tion : I know your own individual merit : 
 I know the wealth which you have 
 sacrificed for me, and my subjects : and 
 I am powerless to express my gratitude." 
 
 ** Had I done any thing more than my 
 duty," replied he, "such words from 
 Your Majesty's lips, would have been a 
 reward adequate to every privation : but, 
 alas, no ! I have perhaps performed less 
 than my duty ; the blood of Sobieski 
 ought not to have been spared one drop, 
 when the liberties of his country pe- 
 rished!" Thaddeus blushed whilst he 
 spoke ; and almost repented the too ready 
 zeal of his friends, in having saved him 
 from the general slaughter at Villanow. 
 
 The voice of the venerable Stanislaus 
 became fainter, as he resumed —

 "Perhaps, had a Sobieski reigned at 
 this tune, these horrors might not have been 
 accompHshed! That tyrannous power, 
 which has crushed my people, I cannot 
 forget is the same which put the sceptre 
 into my hand. Catharine misunderstood 
 my principles : She calculated on giving 
 a traitor to the Poles ; but when she 
 made me a King, she could not oblite- 
 rate the stamp which the King of Kings 
 had graved upon my heart : I believed 
 myself to be his vicegerent ; and to the 
 utmost, I have struggled to fulfil my 
 trust." 
 
 ** Yes, my sovereign !" cried Thad- 
 deus, " and whilst there remains one 
 man on earth, who has drawn his first 
 breath in Poland, he will bear witness 
 in all the lands through which he may 
 be doomed to wander, that he has re- 
 ceived from you the care and affection 
 of a father. O ! Sire, how will future 
 ages believe, that in the midst of civi- 
 lized Europe, a brave people and a vir-

 tuous monarch, were suffered unaided, 
 undeplored, to fall into the grasp of 
 usurpation and murder?" 
 
 Stanislaus laid his hand on the arm of 
 the Count. 
 
 ** Man's ambition and baseness," said 
 he, "are monstrous to the contempla- 
 tion of youth only. You are learning 
 your lesson early : I have studied mine 
 for many years, and with a bitterness of 
 soul, which in some measure prepared 
 me for the completion. My kingdom 
 has passed from me, at the moment you 
 have lost your country. Before we part 
 for ever, my dear Sobieski, take with 
 you this assurance ! — You have served 
 the unfortunate Stanislaus, to the latest 
 hour in which you beheld him. That 
 which you have just said, expressive of 
 the sentiments of those who were my 
 subjects, is indeed a balm to my heart 5 
 and I wdll carry its consolations to my 
 prison." 
 
 The King paused j Sobieski, agitated

 and incapable of speaking, threw himself 
 at His Majesty's feet, and pressed his 
 hand with fervency and anguish to his 
 lips. The King looked down on his 
 graceful figure; and pierced to tlie soul, 
 by the more graceful feelings which dic- 
 tated the action, the tear which stood on 
 his eye-lid rolled over his cheek, and 
 was fbllow^ed by another, before he could 
 add, 
 
 " Rise, my young friend, and take 
 this ring. It contains my picture ; wear 
 it in remembrance of a man who loves 
 you; and who never can forget your 
 worth, or the loyalty and patriotism of 
 your house." 
 
 The Chancellor at that moment be- 
 ing announced, Thaddeus rose from his 
 knee ; and was preparing to leave the 
 room, when His Majesty perceiving his 
 intention, desired him to stop. 
 
 « Stay, Count !" cried he, " I will bur- 
 then you with one request. I am now 
 a King without a crown, without sub-

 jects, without a foot of land, in which 
 to bury me when I die ; I cannot reward 
 the fidehty of any one of the few friends 
 of whom my enemies have not deprived 
 me ; but you are young, and Heaven 
 may yet smile upon you in some distant 
 nation. Will you pay a debt of gratitude 
 for your poor Sovereign? Should you 
 ever again meet with the good old But- 
 zou, who rescued me when my preserv- 
 ation lay on the fortune of a moment, 
 remember, that I regard him as the sa- 
 viour of my life ! I was told to-day, that 
 on the destruction of Prague, this brave 
 man joined the army of my brother. It 
 is now disbanded ; — and he, with the 
 rest of my faithful soldiers, is cast forth 
 in his old age on the bounty of a pityless 
 world. Should you ever meet him, So- 
 bieski, succour him for my sake.'* 
 
 " As Heaven may succour me !" cried 
 Thaddeus ; and putting His Majesty's 
 hand a second time to his lips, he bowed

 to the Chancellor, and passed into the 
 street. 
 
 When the Count returned to the cita- 
 del, he found that all was as the King 
 had represented. The soldiers in the 
 garrison were reluctantly preparing to 
 give up their arms : and the nobles, in 
 compassion to the cries of the people, 
 were trying to humble their necks to 
 the yoke of the ravager. The magis- 
 trates lingered, as they went to take the 
 city keys from the hands of their good 
 King ; and with bitter sighs anticipated 
 the moment in which they must surrender 
 them and their rights into the power of 
 Suwarrow, and that ^foul woman of the 
 Northy^ who exulted in nothing more 
 than devastation. 
 
 Poland was now no place for Sobi- 
 eski. He had survived all his kindred. 
 He had survived the liberties of his 
 country. He had seen the King a pri- 
 soner; and his countrymen trampled on 
 by deceit and cruelty. As he walked

 on, musing over these circumstances, 
 he met with Httle interruption j for the 
 streets were deserted. Here and there 
 a poor miserable wretch passed him, who 
 seemed by his wan cheeks and haggard 
 eyes, already to repent the too success* 
 ful prayers of the deputation. The 
 shops were shut. Thaddeus stopped a 
 few minutes in the great square, which 
 used to be crowded with happy citizens, 
 but now, not one man was to be seen. 
 An awful and expecting silence reigned 
 over all. He sighed ; and walking down 
 the east street, ascended that part of the 
 ramparts which covered the Vistula. 
 
 He turned his eyes to the spot, where 
 once stood the magnificent towers of his 
 paternal palace. 
 
 ** Yes," cried he, ** it is now time for 
 me to obey the last command of my /mo- 
 ther! Nothing remains of Poland, but 
 its soil; nothing of my home but its 
 ashes !" 
 
 The Russians had pitched a detach-

 ment of tents amidst the ruins of Villa- 
 no w ; and were at this moment busying 
 themselves in searching amongst the 
 stupendous fragments for what plunder 
 the fire might liave spared. 
 
 ** Insatiate robbers !" exclaimed Thad- 
 deus, " Heaven will requite this sacri- 
 lege." He thought on the Countess, 
 who lay beneath the ruins, and tore him- 
 self from the sight, whilst, he added, 
 *vFarewell for everj farewell, tliou be- 
 loved Villanow, in which I have spent 
 so many blissful years ! I quit thee, and 
 my country for ever!" As he spoke, he 
 raised his hands and eyes to Heaven, 
 and pressing the picture of his mother 
 to his lips and bosom, turned from the 
 parapet; determining to prepare that 
 night, for his departure the next morning. 
 
 He arose by day-break: and having 
 gathered together all his little wealth ; 
 the whole of which was compressed with*

 his horse; precisely two hours before

 the triiimplial car of General Suwarrow 
 entered Warsaw, Sobieski left it ; and as 
 he rode along the streets, he bedewed 
 its stones with his tears. They were the 
 first that he had shed, during the long 
 series of his misfortunes ; and they now 
 flowed so fast from his eyes he could 
 hardly discern his way out of the city. 
 
 At the great gate his horse stopped. 
 
 " Poor Saladine !" said Thaddeus, 
 stroking his neck, " are you so sorry at 
 leaving Warsaw, that like your unhappy 
 master you linger to take a last look !" 
 
 His tears redoubled ; and the warder, 
 as he closed the gate after him, implored 
 permission to kiss the hand of the noble 
 Count Sobieski ere he should turn his 
 back on Poland never to return. Thad- 
 deus looked kindly round, and shaking 
 hands with the honest man, after saying 
 a few friendly words to him, rode on with 
 a loitering pace till he reached that part 
 of the river which divides Masovia from 
 the Prussian dominions.

 Here he flung himself off his horse ^ 
 and standing for a moment on the hill 
 that rises near the bridge, retraced with 
 his almost blinded eyes the long and 
 desolated lands throiigli which he had 
 passed; then involuntarily dropping on 
 his knees, he plucked a tuft of grass, 
 and pressing it to his lips, exclaimed, 
 " Farewell, Poland ! Farewell all my 
 earthly happiness !" 
 
 Almost stifled by emotion, he put this 
 poor relict of his country into his bosom ; 
 and remounting his horse, crossed the 
 bridge. 
 
 As one, who flying from any particu^ 
 lar object, thinks to lose himself and his 
 sorrows, when it lessens to his view, 
 Sobieski pursued the remainder of his 
 journey with a speed which soon brought 
 him to Dantzic. 
 
 Here he remained a few days, and 
 during that interval the firmness of his 
 mind was restored. He felt a calm aris- 
 ing from the conviction, that his affiic'.

 tions had gained their summit ; and that, 
 however heavy they were, Heaven had 
 laid them on him as a trial of faith and 
 virtue. Under this belief he ceased to 
 weep ; but he never was seen to smile. 
 
 Having entered into an agreement 
 with the master of a vessel to carry him 
 across the sea, he found the strength of 
 his finances would barely defray the 
 charges of the voyage. Considering 
 this circumstance, he saw the impossi- 
 bility of taking his horse to England. 
 
 The first time this idea presented it- 
 self, it almost overset his determined re- 
 signation. Tears would have started 
 into his eyes, had he not by force with- 
 held them. 
 
 ** To part from my faithful Saladine,'^ 
 said he to himself, *'that has borne me 
 since I first could use a sword ; that has 
 carried me through so many dangers; 
 and has come with me, even into exile ; 
 it is painful, it is ungrateful !" He was

 him ; and as the reflections followed 
 each other, he again turned to the stall ; 
 ** But, my poor fellow, I will not barter 
 your services for gold. I will seek for 
 some master who may be kind to you, 
 in pity to my misfortunes." 
 
 He re-entered the hotel where he 
 lodged, and calling a waiter, enquired 
 who occupied the fine mansion and park 
 on the east of the town. The man re- 
 plied, *'Mr. Hopetown, an eminent Bri- 
 tish merchant, who has been settled at 
 Dantzic above forty years." 
 
 ** I am glad he is a Briton!'' was 
 the sentiment which succeeded this in- 
 formation, in the Count's mind. He 
 immediately took his resolution, but 
 hardly had prepared to put into exe- 
 cution, when he received a summons 
 from the captain to be on board in half 
 an hour, as the wind was set fair. 
 
 Thaddeus, rather disconcerted by this 
 hasty call, with a depressed heart wrote 
 the following letter: —

 The Count having sealed and directed 
 this letter, went to the hotel-yard, and 
 ordered that his horse might be brought 
 out A few days of rest had restored him 
 to his former mettle; and he appeared 
 from the stable, prancing, and pawing 
 the earth, as he used to do when Thad- 
 deus was to mount him for the field. 
 
 The groom was striving in vain to re- 
 strain the spirit of the horse, when the 
 Count took hold of his bridle. The 
 noble animal knew his master, and be- 
 came gentle as a lamb. After stroking 
 him two or three times, with a bursting 
 heart he returned the reins to the man's 
 hand, and at the same time gave him 
 the letter. 
 
 ** There," said he, " take that note, and 
 the horse, directly, to the house of Mr. 
 Hopetown. Leave them ; for the letter 
 requires no answer.'* 
 
 This last pang mastered, he walked 
 out of the yard towards the quay. The 
 wind continuing fair, he entered the ship, 
 and within an hour set sail for England*

 SoBiESKi passed the greater part of each- 
 day, and the whole of every night, on the 
 deck of the vessel. He was too much 
 absorbed in himself to receive any amuse- 
 ment from the passengers ; who observ- 
 ing his melancholy, thought to dispel it 
 by their company and conversation. 
 
 When any of these people came upon: 
 deck, he walked to the head of the ship, 
 took his seat upon the cable which bound 
 the anchor to the forecastle ; and while 
 their fears rendered him safe from their 
 well-meant persecution, he gained some 
 respite from vexation, though none from 
 misery. 
 
 The ship having passed through the 
 Baltic, and entered on the British sea, 
 the passengers running from side to side 
 of the vessel pointed out to Thaddeus

 the distant shore of England lying like a 
 hazy ridge along the horizon. The happy 
 people, whilst they strained their eyes 
 through glasses, desired him to observe 
 different spots on the hardly perceptible 
 line, which they called Flamborough 
 Head, and the hills of Yorkshire. His 
 heart turned sick at these objects of 
 pleasure, for not one of them raised a 
 corresponding feeling in his breast. Eng- 
 land could be nothing to him ; if any 
 thing, it would prove a desart, which con- 
 tained no one object for his regrets or 
 wishes. 
 
 The image of Pembroke Somerset rose 
 in his mind, like the dim recollection of 
 one who has been a long time dead. 
 Whilst they were together at Villanow, 
 they loved each other warmly j and when 
 they parted, they promised to correspond. 
 One day, in pursuit of the enemy, Thad- 
 deus was so unlucky as to lose the 
 pocket-book which contained his friend's 
 address 5 but yet, uneasy at his silence,

 he ventured two letters to him, directed 
 merely to Sir Robert Somerset's, Eng- 
 land. To these he received no answer ; 
 and the Palatine evinced so much dis- 
 pleasure at Pembroke's neglect and in- 
 gratitude, that he would not suffer him 
 to be mentioned in his presence ; and 
 indeed Thaddeus, from disappointment 
 and regret, felt no inclination to trans- 
 gress the command. 
 
 When the Count remembered these 
 things, he found little comfort in re- 
 collecting the name of that young Eng- 
 lishman: and now that he was visiting 
 England as a poor exile, with indignation 
 and grief he gave up the wish with the 
 hope of meeting Mr. Somerset. Sensible 
 that Somerset had not acted as became the 
 man to whom he could apply in his dis- 
 tress ; he resolved, unfriended as he was, 
 to wipe him at once from his memory. 
 With a bitter sigh he turned his back on 
 the land to which he was going, and 
 fixed his eyes on the tract of sea which

 divided him from all that ever had given 
 him delight. 
 
 " Father of Heaven !'* murmured he, 
 in a suppressed voice, "what have I 
 done to deserve this misery ? Why have 
 I been, at one stroke, deprived of all 
 that rendered existence estimable ? Two 
 months ago, I had a mother, a more than 
 father, to love and cherish me ; I had a 
 country, that looked up to them and to 
 me, with veneration and confidence j 
 now, I am bereft of all j I have neither 
 father, mother, nor country, but am 
 going to a land of strangers." 
 
 Such impatient adjurations were never 
 wrung from Sobieski by the anguish of 
 sudden torture, without his ingenuous 
 and pious mind reproachmg itself for 
 repining. His soul was soft as a woman's ; 
 but it knew neither effeminacy nor de- 
 spair. Whilst his heart bled, his coun- 
 tenance retained its serenity. Whilst 
 affliction crushed him to the earth, and 
 nature paid a few hard wrung drops to

 her expected dissolution, he contemned 
 his tears, and raised his fixed and con- 
 fiding eye to that power which poured 
 down its tempests on his head. Thad- 
 deus felt as a man, but received conso- 
 lation as a Christian. 
 
 When the ship arrived at the mouth of 
 the Thames, the eagerness of the passen- 
 gers increased to such an excess, that 
 they would not stand still, nor be silent 
 a moment; and when the vessel, under 
 full sail, passed Sheerness, and the dome 
 of St. Paul's appeared before them, their 
 exclamations were loud and incessant. 
 " My home ! my parents ! my wife ! my 
 friends!" were the burthen of every 
 tongue. 
 
 Thaddeus found his irritable spirits 
 again disturbed ; and rising from his seat 
 he retired unobserved by the people, who 
 were too happy to attend to any thing 
 which did not agree with their own trans- 
 ports. The cabin was as deserted as him- 
 self. Feeling that there is no solitude

 like that of the heart, when it looks 
 around and sees in the vast concourse of 
 human beings, not one to whom it can 
 pour forth its sorrows ; and in return re- 
 ceive the answering sigh of sympathy ; 
 he threw himself on one of the lockers, 
 and with difficulty restrained the tears 
 from gushing from his eyes. He held 
 his hand over them, while he contemned 
 himself for a weakness so unbecoming 
 his character. 
 
 He despised himself: but let not others 
 despise him. It is difficult for those who 
 are in prosperity ; who lie morning and 
 evening in the lap of indulgence j to con- 
 ceive the misery of being thrown out into 
 a bleak and merciless world : it is im- 
 possible for the happy man, surrounded 
 by luxury and gay companions, to figure 
 to himself the reflections of a fellow- 
 creature, who, having been fostered in the 
 bosom of affection and elegance, is cast 
 at once from society, bereft of home, of 
 comfort, of ^^ every stay^ save innocetice and

 Heaven,^ ^ None but the wretched can 
 imagine what the wretched endure, from 
 actual distress; from apprehended mis- 
 fortune ; from outraged feelings ; and 
 ten thousand nameless sensibilities to in- 
 jury, which only the unfortunate can 
 conceive, dread, and experience. 
 
 Such were the anticipating fears of the 
 Count. Books, and report, led him to 
 respect the English : Pembroke Somer- 
 set, at one time, would have taught him 
 to love them : but the nearer he ad- 
 vanced towards the shore, the remem- 
 brance that it was from this country his 
 father came, made him doubt the hu- 
 manity of a people, of which his own 
 parent and forgetful friend were such 
 detestable specimens. 
 
 The noise redoubled above his head ; 
 and in a few minutes afterwards, one of 
 the sailors came rumbling down the 
 stairs. 
 
 " Will it please Your Honour,'' said he, 
 " to get up ? That be my chest, and I

 want my clothes to clean myself before 
 I go on shore ; mother, I know, be wait- 
 ing me at Blackwall." 
 
 Thaddeus rose, and seeing that quiet 
 was not to be found any where, again 
 ascended to the deck. 
 
 On coming up the hatchway, he saw 
 that the ship was moored in the midst of 
 a large city ; and was surrounded by 
 myriads of vessels, from every quarter of 
 the globe. Sobieski leaned over the 
 railing, and in silence looked down on 
 the other passengers, who were bearing 
 off in boats, and shaking hands with the 
 people who came to receive them. 
 
 " It is near dark. Sir,'' said the captain j 
 " mayhap you would like to go on shore ? 
 There is a boat just come round, and 
 the tide won't serve much longer ; and 
 as your friends don't seem to be coming 
 for you, you are welcome to a place in it 
 with me." 
 
 The Count thanked him ; and after de- 
 fraying the expenses of the voyage, and

 giving money amongst the seamen, he 
 desired that his portmanteau might be 
 put into the wherry. The honest fellows, 
 in gratitude to the bounty of their pas- 
 senger, struggled who should obey his 
 commands ; when the captain, angry 
 at being detained, snatched away the 
 baggage, and flinging it into the boat, 
 leaped in after it, and was followed by 
 Thaddeus. 
 
 The taciturnity of the sailor, and the 
 deep melancholy of his guest, did not 
 break silence, until they reached the 
 Tower-Stairs. 
 
 " Go, Ben, fetch the gentleman a 
 coach." 
 
 The Count bowed to the captain, who 
 gave the order; and in a few minutes 
 the boy returned, saying there was one 
 in waiting. He took up the portmanteau, 
 and Thaddeus followed him to the Tower- 
 Gate, where the carriage stood. Ben 
 threw in the baggage : the Count put his 
 foot on the step.

 " Where must the man drive to ?" 
 
 Thaddeus drew it back again. 
 
 ** Yes, Sir/' continued the lad ; " where 
 is Your Honour's home ?" 
 
 " In my grave," was the response his 
 aching heart made to this question. He 
 hesitated before he spoke. ** An hotel," 
 said he, flinging himself on the seat, and 
 throwing some silver into the sailor's 
 hat. 
 
 « What hotel, Sir ?" asked the coach- 
 man, 
 
 " Any." 
 
 The man closed the door, mounted his 
 box, and drove off. 
 
 It was now near seven o'clock, of a 
 dark December evening. The lamps 
 were lighted ; and it being Saturday 
 night, the streets were crowded with 
 people. Thaddeus looked at them as he 
 was driven along : " Happy creatures !" 
 thought he, ** you have each a home to 
 go to ; you have each expecting friends 
 to welcome youj every one of you knows

 some being in the world, who will smile 
 when you enter ; whilst I, unhappy man ! 
 am shut out from every social comfort. 
 Wretched, wretched Sobieski ! where are 
 now all thy highly prized treasures ; thy 
 boasted glory; and those beloved friends 
 who rendered that glory most precious to 
 thee ? Alas ! all are withdrawn ; vanished 
 like a dream of enchantment ; from which 
 I have indeed awakened, to a frightful 
 solitude." 
 
 His reflections were broken by the 
 stopping of the carriage. The man 
 opened the door. 
 
 " Sir, I have brought you to the Hum- 
 mums, Covent Garden : it has as good 
 accommodations as any in town. My 
 fare is five shillings." 
 
 Thaddeus gave the demand ; and fol- 
 lowed him, and his baggage, into the 
 coffee-room. At the entrance of a man 
 of his figure, several waiters presented 
 themselves, begging to know his com- 
 mands.

 " I want a chamber." 
 
 He was ushered into a very handsome 
 dining-room, where one of them laid down 
 the portmanteau, and then bowing low, 
 enquired whether he had dined. 
 
 The waiter having received his orders, 
 (for the Count saw that it was necessary 
 to call for something,) hastened into the 
 kitchen to communicate them to the 
 cook. 
 
 " Upon my soul, Betty," cried he, 
 " you must do your best to-night, for 
 the chicken is for the finest looking fel- 
 low you ever set eyes on. By heaven, I 
 believe him to be some Russian noble- 
 man ; perhaps the great Suwarrow him- 
 self." 
 
 " A prince you mean, Jenkins !" said 
 a pretty girl, who entered at that mo- 
 ment: *' since I was born I never see'd 
 any English lord walk up and down a 
 room with such an air ; he looks like a 
 king. For my pai't, I should not wonder 
 if he was one of them there emigrant

 kings ; for they say there is a power of 
 them now wandering about the world." 
 
 " You talk like a fool, Sally,'* cried 
 the sapient waiter. " Don't you see that 
 his dress is military ? Look at his black 
 cap, with its long bag and great feather, 
 and the monstrous sabre at his side ; 
 look at them, and then if you can, say I 
 am mistaken in pronouncing that he is 
 some great Russian commander, — most 
 likely come over as ambassador !" 
 
 " But he came in a hackney coach,'* 
 cried a little dirty boy in the corner. 
 " As I was running up stairs with Colonel 
 Leeson's shoes, I see'd the coachman 
 bring in his portmanteau." 
 
 " Well, Jack-a-napes, what of that ?" 
 cried Jenkins : " Is a nobleman always 
 to carry his equipage about him, like a 
 snail with its shell on its back ? To be 
 sure, this foreign lord, or prince, is 
 only come to stay here, till his own 
 house is fit for him. I will be civil to 
 him."

 " And so will I, Jenkins,'* rejoined 
 Sally, smiling ; "for I never see'd such 
 handsome blue eyes in my born days ; 
 and they turned so sweet on me, and he 
 spoke so kindly when he bade me stir 
 the fire ; and when he sat down by it, 
 and throw' d off his great fur cloak, he 
 showed a glittering star ; and a figure 
 so noble, that indeed, cook, I do verily 
 believe he is, as Jenkins says, an en- 
 throned king !" 
 
 " You and Jenkins be a pair of fools,'* 
 cried the cook, who, without noticing 
 their description, had been sulkily bast- 
 ing the fowl : " I will be sworn he'a 
 just such another king, as that palaver- 
 ing rogue was a French duke, who got 
 my master's watch, and pawned it 1 As 
 for you, Sally, you had better beware of 
 hunting after foreign men-folk : it's not 
 seemly for a young woman, and you may 
 chance to rue it." 
 
 The moralizing cook had now brought 
 the whole kitchen on her shoulders^

 236 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 The men abused her for a surly old 
 maid ; and the women tittered, whilst 
 they seconded her censure, by cutting 
 sly jokes on the blushing face of poor 
 Sally, who stood almost crying, by the 
 side of her champion Jenkins. 
 
 Whilst this hubbub was going forward 
 below stairs, its unconscious subject was, 
 as Sally had described, sitting in a chair 
 close to the fire, with his feet on the 
 fender, his arms folded, and his eyes 
 bent on the flames. He mused j but his 
 ideas followed each other in such quick 
 and confused succession, that it hardly 
 could be said he thought of any thing. 
 
 The entrance of dinner roused him 
 from his reverie. It was carried in by 
 at least half a dozen waiters. The 
 Count had been so accustomed to a nu- 
 merous suite of attendants, he did not 
 observe the parcelling out of his tem- 
 perate meal ; one bringing in the fowl, 
 another the bread, his neighbour the so- 
 litary plate ; and the rest in like order :

 SO solicitous were the male listeners in 
 the kitchen, to see this wonderful Rus- 
 sian. 
 
 Thaddeus partook but lightly of the 
 refreshment. Being already fatigued in 
 body, and dizzy with the motion of the 
 vessel, as soon as the cloth was with- 
 drawn he ordered a night-candle, and 
 desired to be shown to his chamber. 
 
 Jenkins, whom the sight of the em- 
 broidered star, confirmed in his decision 
 that the foreigner must be a person of 
 consequence, with increased agility 
 whipped up the portmanteau, and led 
 the way to the sleeping-rooms. Here, 
 curiosity put on a new form ; the women- 
 servants, determined to have their wishes 
 gratified as well as the men, had ar- 
 ranged themselves on each side of the 
 passage through which the Count must 
 pass. At so strange an appearance, 
 Thaddeus drew back ; but supposing 
 that it might be a custom of the coun- 
 try, he proceeded through this fair bevy ;

 and bowed as he walked ak)ng, to the 
 low curtsies, which they continued to 
 make until he entered his apartment and 
 closed the door. 
 
 The unhappy are ever restless : they 
 hope in every change of situation to ob- 
 tain some alteration in their feelings. 
 Thaddeus was too miserable awake, not 
 to view with eagerness, the bed on 
 which he trusted that for a few hours at 
 least, he might lose his consciousness of 
 suffering, with its remembrance.

 When he awoke in the morning, his 
 head ached, and he felt as un refreshed 
 as when he had lain down ; he undrew 
 the curtain, and saw from the strength 
 of the Hght, it must be mid-day. He 
 got up ; and having dressed himself, de- 
 scended to the sitting-room 5 where he 
 found a good fire, and the breakfast al- 
 ready placed. He rang the bell ; and 
 walked to the window, to observe the 
 appearance of the morning. A heavy 
 snow had fallen during the night; and 
 the sun, ascended to its meridian^ shone 
 through the thick atmosphere, like a ball 
 of fire. All seemed comfortless v/ithout; 
 and turning back to the warm hearth, 
 which was blazing at the other end of the

 room, he was reseating himself when 
 Jenkins brought in the tea-urn. 
 
 «' I hope, my Lord,'* said the waiter, 
 <« that Your Lordship slept well last 
 night ?" 
 
 " Perfectly, I thank you," replied the 
 Count, unmindful that the man addressed 
 him according to his rank ; ** when you 
 come to remove these things, bring me 
 my bill." 
 
 Jenkins bowed and withdrew ; congra- 
 tulating himself on his dexterity in hav- 
 ing saluted the stranger with his title. 
 
 During the absence of the waiter, 
 Thaddeus thought it time to examine 
 the state of his purse : he well recol- 
 lected how he had paid at Dantzic ; and 
 from the style in which he was served 
 here, he did not doubt but that to defray 
 what he had contracted, would nearly ex- 
 haust his all. He emptied the contents 
 of his pocket, into his hand ; a guinea, 
 and some silver, was all that he possessed. 
 A flush of terror suffused itself over his

 face ; h^ had never known the want of 
 money before, and he trembled now, 
 lest the charge should exceed his means 
 of payment. 
 
 Jenkins entered with the bill. On the 
 Count's examining it, he was pleased to 
 to find it amounted to no more than the 
 only piece of gold his purse contained. 
 He laid it upon the tea-board, and put- 
 ting half-a-crown into the hand of Jen- 
 kins, who appeared waiting for some- 
 thing, ^wrapped his cloak round him, and 
 was walking out of the room. 
 
 " I suppose, my Lord," cried Jenkins, 
 pocketing the money with a smirk, and 
 bowing with the things in his hands, 
 " we are to have the honour of seeing 
 Your Lordship again, as you leave your 
 portmanteau behind you ?" 
 
 Thaddeus hesitated a few seconds, 
 then again moving towards the door, 
 said, " I will send for it." 
 
 " By what name, my Lord ?" 
 
 " The Count Sobieski."

 Jenkins immediately set down the tea- 
 board, and hurrying after Thaddeus 
 along the passage and through the 
 coffee-room; darted before him, and 
 opening the door for him to go out, ex- 
 claimed loud enough for every body to 
 hear, " Depend upon it. Count Sobi- 
 eski, I will take care of Your Lordship^s 
 baggage." 
 
 Thaddeus, rather displeased at his 
 noisy officiousness, only bent his head, 
 and proceeded into the street. 
 
 The air was piercing cold ; and on his 
 looking around, he perceived by the dis- 
 position of the square in which he was, 
 that it must be a market-place. The 
 booths and stands were covered with 
 snow ; whilst parts of the pavement were 
 rendered nearly impassable by heaps of 
 black ice which the market-people of the 
 preceding day had shovelled up out of 
 their way. He now recollected that it 
 was Sunday, and consequently the im-

 probability of finding any lodgings on 
 that day. 
 
 He stood under the piazzas for two or 
 three minutes, bewildered on the plan he 
 should adopt ; to return to the hotel for 
 any purpose but to sleep, in the present 
 state of his finances, would be impos- 
 sible : he therefore gave himself up, in- 
 clement as the season was, to walk the 
 streets until night. He might then go 
 back to the Hummums to his bed-cham- 
 ber ; but he resolved to quit it in the 
 morning, for a residence more suitable 
 to the reduction of his fortunes. 
 
 The wind blew a keen north-east, ac- 
 companied with a violent shower of sleet 
 and rain ; yet such was the abstraction of 
 his mind, that he hardly observed its bit- 
 terness, but walked on, careless whither 
 his feet led him, until he stopped oppo- 
 site to St. Martin's church. 
 
 " God is my only friend,'* said he to 
 liimself ; *' and in his house, I shall surely 
 find shelter !"

 He turned up the steps, and was en- 
 tering the porch, when he met the con- 
 gregation thronging out of it. 
 
 "Is the service over?" he enquired 
 of a decent old woman, who was passing 
 him down the stairs. The woman started 
 at this question, asked her in English by 
 a person whose dress was so completely 
 foreign. He repeated it; and smiling 
 and curtseying, she replied — 
 
 " Yes, Sir ; and I am sorry for it. Lord 
 bless your handsome face, though you be 
 a stranger gentleman, it does one's heart 
 good to see you so devoutly given !" 
 
 Thaddeus blushed at this personal 
 compliment, though it came from the 
 lips of a wrinkled old woman ; and beg- 
 ging permission to assist her down the 
 stairs, he asked when service would be- 
 gin again. 
 
 «« At three o'clock, Sir, and may 
 Heaven bless the mother who bore so 
 pious a son !" 
 
 As the poor woman spoke, she raised

 her eyes with a melancholy resignation. 
 The Count touched with her words and 
 manner, almost unconsciously to himself, 
 continued by her side as she hobbled 
 down the street. 
 
 His eyes were fixed on the ground, 
 until, as he walked forward, somebody 
 pressing against him, made him look 
 round. He saw that his aged companion 
 had just knocked at the door of a mean- 
 looking house ; and that his new ac- 
 quaintance and himself were surrounded 
 by nearly a dozen people, besides boys, 
 who through curiosity had followed them 
 from the church porch. 
 
 << Ah ! sweet Sir," cried she ; " these 
 folks are staring at so fine a gentleman 
 taking notice of age and poverty.'* 
 
 Thaddeus was uneasy at the inquisi- 
 tive gaze of the bye-standers ; and his 
 companion observing the fluctuations of 
 his countenance, added, as the door was 
 opened by a little girl ;

 the rain, and warm yourself by my poor 
 fire?" 
 
 He hesitated a moment ; then, ac- 
 cepting her invitation, bent his head to 
 get under the humble door-way ; and 
 following through a neatly-sanded pas- 
 sage, entered a small but clean kichen. 
 A little boy, who was sitting on a stool 
 near the fire, uttered a scream at the 
 sight of a stranger ; and running up to 
 his grandmother, rolled himself in her 
 cloak, crying out ; 
 
 " Mammy, mammy, take away that 
 black man !" 
 
 " Be quiet, William ; it is a gentleman, 
 and no black man. I am so ashamed. 
 Sir ; but he is only three years old." 
 
 ** I should apologise to you," returned 
 the Count, smiling, <* for introducing a 
 person so hideous as to frighten your 
 family." 
 
 By the time he finished speaking, the 
 good dame had pacified the screaming 
 child y who stood trembling, and looking

 askance, at the tremendous black gentle- 
 man stroking the head of his pretty sister. 
 
 " Come here, my dear !'' said Thad- 
 deus, seating himself by the iire, and 
 stretching out his hand to the child. It 
 instantly buried its head in its grand- 
 mother's apron. 
 
 " William ! William !" cried his sister, 
 pulling him by the arm, «« the gentleman 
 will not hurt you." 
 
 The boy again lifted up his head. 
 Thaddeus threw back his long sable 
 cloak, and taking offhis cap, whose hearse- 
 like plumes, he thought, might have 
 terrified the child, he laid it on the 
 ground ; and again stretching forth his 
 arms, called the boy to approach him. 
 Little William now looked stedfastly in 
 his face, and then on the cap, which he 
 had laid beside him ; and then, whilst he 
 grasped his grandmother's apron with 
 one hand, he held out the other, half 
 assured, towards the Count. Thaddeus 
 took it, and pressing it softly, pulled

 him gently to him, and placing him 
 on his knee, " My little fellow,'* said 
 he, kissing him, *' you are not frightened 
 now ?'' 
 
 *' No," said the child ; " I see you are 
 not the ugly black man, who takes away 
 naughty boys. The ugly black man has a 
 black face, and snakes on his head ; but 
 these are pretty curls !*' added he, laugh- 
 ing, and putting his little fingers through 
 the thick auburn hair, which hung in 
 neglected masses over the forehead of the 
 Count. 
 
 ** I am ashamed Your Honour should 
 sit in a kitchen," rejoined the old lady 5 
 ** but I have not a fire in any other 
 room." 
 
 " Yes," said her grand-daughter, who 
 was about twelve years old, " grand- 
 mother has a nice first floor up stairs; 
 but because we have no lodgers, there be 
 no fire there." 
 
 " Be silent, Nanny Robson," said the 
 dame : ** your pertness teases the gentle-

 ** O, not at all/' cried Thaddeus ; '* I 
 ought to thank her, for she informs me 
 you have lodgings to let ; will you allow 
 me to engage them ?" 
 
 " You, Sir," cried Mrs. Robson, thun- 
 derstruck, "for what purpose? Surely 
 so noble a gentleman would not live in 
 such a place as this." 
 
 *< I would, Mrs. Robson : I know not 
 where I could live with more comfort; 
 and where comfort is, my good madam, 
 what signifies the costliness or plainness 
 of the dwelling ?" 
 
 " Well, Sir, if you be indeed serious ; 
 but I cannot think you so : you are cer- 
 tainly making a joke of me, for my 
 boldness in asking you into my poor 
 house." 
 
 <« Upon my honour, I am not, Mrs. 
 Robson. I would gladly be your lodger, 
 if you will admit me ; and to convince 
 you that I am in earnest, my portmanteau 
 shall this moment be brought here." 
 
 *< Well, Sir," resumed she, " I shall be 
 honoured in having you in my house ;

 yourself, not even for a servant." 
 
 " I have no servant." 
 
 " Then I will wait on him, grandmo- 
 ther," cried the little Nanny ; " do let 
 the gentleman have them, I am sure he 
 looks honest." 
 
 The old woman coloured at this last ob- 
 servation of the child, and proceeded. 
 
 " Then, Sir, if you should not disdain 
 the rooms when you see them, I shall be 
 too happy in having so good a gentleman 
 under my roof. Pardon my boldness. 
 Sir ; but may I ask ? I think by your 
 dress, you are a foreigner ?" 
 
 " I am," replied Thaddeus, the ra- 
 diance which played over his features 
 contracting into a gloom ; " if you have 
 no objection to take a stranger within 
 your doors, from this hour I shall con- 
 sider your house as my home ?" 
 
 " As Your Honour pleases," said Mrs. 
 Robson ; ** my terms are half a-guinea a 
 week ; and I will attend on you, as

 though you were my own son ! for I can- 
 not forget, excellent young gentleman, 
 the way in which we first met." 
 
 " Then I will leave you for the pre- 
 sent," returned he, rising, and putting 
 down the little William ; who had been 
 amusing himself with examining the sil- 
 ver points of the star of St. Stanislaus, 
 which the Count wore on his breast : 
 " In the mean while," said he, *' my 
 pretty friend," stooping to the child, 
 " let this bit of silver," was just mount- 
 ing to his tongue, as he put his hand into 
 his pocket to take out half-a-crown ; but 
 he recollected that his necessities would 
 no longer admit of such gifts ; and draw- 
 ing his hand back, with a deep and bitter 
 sigh, he touched the boy's cheek with 
 his lips, and added, '' let this kiss remind 
 you of your new friend." 
 
 This was the first time the generous 
 
 spirit of Sobieski had been restrained ; 
 
 and he suffered a pang, for the poignancy 
 
 of which he could not account. His had

 been a life accustomed to acts of munifi- 
 cence. His grandfather's palace, was 
 the asylum of the unhappy ; his grand- 
 father's purse, a treasury for the unfor- 
 tunate. The soul of Thaddeus did not 
 degenerate from his noble relative : his 
 generosity, begun in inclination, was 
 nurtured by reflection, and strengthened 
 with a daily exercise, which rendered it 
 a habit of his nature. Want never ap- 
 peared before him, without exciting a 
 sympathetic emotion in his heart, which 
 never rested until he had administered 
 every comfort in the power of wealth to 
 bestow. His compassion and his purse 
 were the substance and shadow of each 
 other. The poor of his country thronged 
 from every part of the kingdom, to re- 
 ceive pity and reUef at his hands. With 
 these houseless wanderers, he peopled 
 the new villages, his grandfather had 
 erected in the midst of lands, which in 
 former times were the haunts of wild 
 beasts. Thaddeus participated in the hap- 
 14

 piness of his grateful tenants ; and many 
 were the old men, whose eyes he had closed 
 in thankfulness and peace. These honest 
 peasants, even in their dying moments, 
 wished to give up that life in his arms, 
 which he had rescued from misery. He 
 visited their cottage ; he smoothed their 
 pillow ; he joined in their prayers : and 
 when their last sigh came to his ear, he 
 raised the weeping family from the dust ; 
 and cheered them with pious exhort- 
 ations, and his kindest assurances of pro- 
 tection. How often has the Countess 
 clasped her godlike son to her breast, 
 when after a scene like this, he had re- 
 turned home, the tears of the dying man 
 and his children yet wet upon his hand ! 
 how often has she strained him to her 
 heart, whilst floods of rapture have 
 poured from her own eyes ! Heir to the 
 first fortune in Poland, he scarcely knew 
 the means by which he bestowed all 
 these benefits ; and with a soul as boun- 
 teous to others, as Heaven had been

 munificent to him, wherever he moved, 
 he shed smiles and gifts around him. 
 How frequently has he said to the Pala- 
 tine, when his carriage- wheels were chased 
 bythe thankful multitude; "O, my father! 
 how can I ever be sufficiently grateful 
 to God, for the happiness he hath allotted 
 to me, in making me the dispenser of so 
 many blessings ! The gratitude of these 
 people overpowers and humbles me in 
 my own eyes ; what have I done to be 
 so eminently favoured of Heaven ? I 
 tremble, when I ask myself the ques- 
 tion." — *'You may tremble, my dear 
 boy," replied his grandfather, " for in- 
 deed the trial is a severe one: prosperity, 
 like adversity, is an ordeal of conduct. 
 Two roads are before the rich man; 
 vanity or virtue : You have chosen the 
 latter, and the best : and may Heaven 
 ever hold you in it ! May Heaven ever 
 keep your heart generous and pure ! Go 
 on, my dear Thaddeus, as you have com- 
 menced ; and you will find, that your

 Creator hath bestowed wealth upon you, 
 not for what you have done, but as the 
 means of evincing how well you would 
 prove yourself His faithful steward." 
 
 This "was the fortune of Thaddeus ; and 
 now, he who had scattered thousands 
 without counting them, drew back his 
 hand with something like horror at his 
 own injustice;pwhen he was going to give 
 away one little piece of silver — which he 
 might want in a day or two, to defray 
 some indispensable debt. 
 
 «< Mrs. Robson," said he, as he replaced 
 his cap upon his head, ** I shall return 
 before it is dark." 
 
 '' Very well, Sir ;" and opening the 
 door, he went out into the lane. 
 
 Ignorant of the town, and thanking 
 Providence for having prepared him an 
 asylum, he directed his course towards 
 Charing Cross. He looked about him 
 with deepened sadness ; the wet and 
 plash y state of the streets gave to every 
 object so comfortless an appearance he

 256 THADBEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 could scarcely believe himself to be in 
 that London, of which he had read with 
 so much delight. Where were the mag- 
 nificent buildings, he expected to see in 
 the emporium of the world ? Where that 
 cleanliness ; and those tokens of great- 
 ness and splendour, which had been the 
 admiration and boast of travellers ? He 
 could no where discover thelti ; all seemed 
 parts of a dark, gloomy, mean-looking 
 city. 
 
 Hardly heeding whither he went, he 
 approached the Horse-Guards ; a view of 
 the Park, as it appears through the wide 
 porch, promised him less unpleasantness 
 than the dirty pavement, and he turned 
 in, taking his way along the Bird- Cage 
 Walk. 
 
 The trees, stripped of their leaves, stood 
 naked, and dripping with melted snow. 
 The season was in unison with the Count's 
 fate. He was taking the bitter wind for 
 his repast ; and quenching his thirst with 
 the rain that fell on his pale and feverish

 lip : he felt the cutting blast enter his 
 breast ; and shutting his eye-lids, to 
 repel the tears which were rising from 
 his heart, he walked faster ; but in spite 
 of himselfi their drops mingled with the 
 wet that trickled from his cap upon his 
 face. One melancholy thought intro- 
 duced another, until his agitated soul 
 lived over again, in memory, every cala- 
 mity which had reduced him from hap- 
 piness to misery. Two or three heavy 
 convulsive sighs followed these reflec- 
 tions; and quickening his pace, he walked 
 once or twice quite round the Park. The 
 rain ceased. Hardly observing the peo- 
 ple who passed, he threw himself down 
 upon one of the chairs ; and sat in a 
 musing posture, with his eyes fixed on 
 the opposite tree. 
 
 A sound of voices approaching, roused 
 him ; turning his eyes, he saw the speak- 
 ers were two young men, and by their 
 dress, he judged they must belong to the

 regiment of the centinel who was patrol- 
 Hng at the end of the Mall. 
 
 '^ By Heavens, Berrington," cried 
 one, " it is the best shaped boot I ever 
 beheld ! I have a good mind to ask him, 
 whether it be English make!" 
 
 " And if it be," replied the other with 
 a sneer, " you must ask him who made 
 his legs ; that you may send yours to be 
 mended." 
 
 " Who the devil can see my legs through 
 that boot ?" 
 
 " Oh, if to hide them be your reason, 
 pray ask him immediately." 
 
 *« And so I will, for I think the boot 
 damned handsome." 
 
 At these words, he was making to- 
 wards Sobieski with two or three long 
 strides, when his companion pulled him 
 back. 
 
 " Surely, Harwold, you will not act 
 so ridiculously ? He appears to be a fo- 
 reigner of rank : and he may take offence, 
 and knock you down."

 " Curse him and his rank too ; he is 
 some paltry emigrant, I wan-ant ; and 
 may the devil fly away with my legs, if I 
 don't ask him who made his boots !'' 
 
 As he spoke, he would have dragged 
 his companion along with him, but Ber- 
 rington broke from his arm ; and the 
 fool, who now thought himself dared to 
 it, strode up close to the chair, and bowed 
 to Thaddeus, who (hardly crediting that 
 he could be the subject of this dialogue) 
 returned the salutation with a cold bend 
 of his head. 
 
 Harwold looked a little confounded .at 
 this haughty demeanour ; and once in 
 his life blushing at his own insolence, he 
 roared out, as in defiance of shame : 
 
 ** Pray, Sir, where did you get your 
 boots?" 
 
 " Where I got my sword, Sir,'* replied 
 Thaddeus, calmly : and, rising from his 
 seat, he darted his eyes disdainfully on 
 the coxcomb, and walked slowly down 
 the Mall. Surprised and shocked at

 such' behaviour in a British officer, as 
 he moved away, he distinctly heard Ber- 
 rington laughing aloud, and ridiculing 
 the astonishment, and set-down air, of 
 h^'s impudent associate. 
 
 This incident did not so much ruffle 
 the temper of Thaddeus, as it amazed 
 and perplexed him. 
 
 " Is this a specimen,'' thought he, 
 ** of a nation which on the Continent is 
 venerated for courage, manliness, and 
 generosity ? Well, I find I have much to 
 learn. I must go through the ills of 
 life, to estimate myself thoroughly ; and 
 I must study mankind in themselves, 
 and not in their history, to have a true 
 knowledge of what they are.'* 
 
 This strange rencontre was of service 
 to him, by diverting his mind from the 
 intense contemplation of his situation ; 
 and as the dusk drew on, he turned his 
 steps towards the Hummums. 
 
 On entering the coffee-room he was 
 met by the obsequious Jenkins ; who

 being told by Thaddeus, that he wanted 
 his baggage, and a carriage, went for 
 the things himself, and sent a boy for a 
 coach. 
 
 A man drest in black was standing 
 by the chimney, and seemed to be eye- 
 ing Thaddeus, as he walked up and 
 down, with great attention. Just as he 
 had taken another turn, and drew near 
 him, the stranger accosted him rather 
 abruptly. 
 
 ** Pray, Sir, are there any news stirring 
 abroad ? you seem. Sir, to be come from 
 abroad." 
 
 *« None, that I know of; Sir." 
 
 " Bless me, that's strange. I thought, 
 Sir, you came from abroad, Sir ; from the 
 Continent, from Poland, Sir ? at least the 
 waiter said so. Sir." 
 
 Thaddeus coloured : " The waiter. 
 Sir ?" 
 
 *« I mean, Sir," continued the gentle- 
 man, visibly confused at the dilemma 
 into which he had brought himself.

 ^262 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 " the waiter said that you were a Count, 
 Sir ; a Polish Count ; indeed the Count 
 Sobieski ! Hence I concluded that you 
 are from Poland. If I have offended, I 
 beg pardon, Sir ; but in these times we 
 are anxious for every intelligence." 
 
 Thaddeus made no other reply, than 
 a slight inclination of his head ; and 
 w^alking forward, to see whether the 
 coach were arrived, he thought, — what- 
 ever travellers had related of the Eng- 
 lish, they were the most impertinent 
 people in the world. 
 
 The stranger would not be contented 
 with what he had already said, but 
 plucking up new courage, pursued the 
 Count to the glass-door through which 
 he was looking, and resumed. 
 
 " I believe. Sir, I am not wrong ? you 
 are the Count Sobieski ; and I have the 
 honour to be now speaking with the 
 bravest champion of Polish liberty !" 
 
 Thaddeus again bowed ; " I thank you. 
 Sir, for the compliment you intend me ;

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. ^63 
 
 but I cannot take it to myself; all the 
 men of Poland, old and young, nobles 
 and peasants, were her champions, 
 equally sincere, equally brave." 
 
 Nothing could silence the inquisitive 
 stranger : the coach drew up, but he 
 went on. 
 
 ''Then I hope, that many of these 
 patriots, besides Your Excellency, have 
 taken care to bring away their wealth 
 from a land which is now abandoned to 
 destruction ?" 
 
 For a moment Thaddeus forgot him- 
 self in his country j and all her rights, 
 and all her sufferings, rose in his counte- 
 nance. 
 
 *' No, Sir! Not one of those men; 
 and least of all, would I have drawn 
 one vital drop from her heart! I left in 
 her bosom all that was dear to me ; 
 all that I possessed ; and not until I saw 
 the chains brought before my eyes, that 
 were to lay her in irons, did I turn my

 back on calamities, I could no longer 
 avert or alleviate." 
 
 The ardour of his manner, and the 
 elevation of voice, had drawn the atten- 
 tion of every person in the room upon 
 him, when Jenkins entered with his bag- 
 gage. The door being opened, Sobi- 
 eski got into the coach, and gladly has- 
 tened from a conversation which had 
 awakened all his griefs. 
 
 " Ah, poor enthusiast !" exclaimed 
 his inquisitor, as the carriage drove off: 
 " It is a pity that so fine a young man 
 should have made so ill a use of his 
 buth, and other advantages !" 
 
 " He appears to me," observed an 
 old clergyman, who sat in an adjoining- 
 box, " to have made the best possible 
 use of his natural advantages ; and had 
 I a son, I would rather hear him utter 
 such a sentiment as that with which he 
 quitted the room, than see him master 
 of millions."

 " May be so," cried the questioner, 
 with a disdainful glance, " * different minds 
 incline to different objects /' His, has de- 
 cided for ' the W07iderful, the wild ;' and

 ** Why to be sure," observed another 
 spectator, " young people should be 
 brought up with reasonable ideas of right 
 and wrong, and prudence : neverthe- 
 less, I should not like a son of mine, to 
 run harum scarum, through my property, 
 and his own life ; and vet one cannot 
 help, when one hears such a brave 
 speech, as that from yon Frenchman, 
 just gone out, — I say, one cannot help 
 thinking it very fine." 
 
 " True, true," cried the inquisitor, 
 ** you are right, Sir ; very fine, indeed, 
 but too fine to wear ; it would soon leave 
 us naked, as it has done him ; for it 
 seems by his own confession, he is penny- 
 less ; and I know, a twelvemonth ago, 
 he was a master of a fortune which, how- 
 ever incalculable, he has managed with 
 all his talents to see the end of."

 " Then he is in distress!" exclaimed 
 he clergyman, " and you know him : 
 What is his name ?" 
 
 The man coloured at this unexpected 
 inference ; and glad the company had 
 not attended to the part of the dialogue 
 in which the name of Sobieski was men- 
 tioned, — he stammered some indistinct 
 words ; took up his hat ; and looking at 
 his watch, begged pardon for having an 
 appointment; — and hurried out of the 
 room without speaking farther ; although 
 the good clergyman, whose name was 
 Blackmore, hastened after him, request- 
 ing to know where the young foreigner 
 lived. 
 
 " Who is that coxcomb ?" cried the 
 disconcerted doctor, as he returned from 
 his unavailing application. 
 
 " I don't know, Sir," replied the 
 waiter : " I never saw him in this house 
 before last night, when he came in late 
 to sleep ; and this morning he was in the 
 coffee-room at breakfast, just as that fo-

 reign gentleman walked througli ; and 
 Jenkins, bawling his name out very loud, 
 as soon as he was gone, this here gentle- 
 man asked him, who that Count was. I 
 heard Jenkins say some Russian name ; 
 and tell him, he came last night, and 
 likely would come back again ; and so, 
 that there gentleman has been loitering 
 about all day till now when the foreign 
 gentleman coming in, he spoke to him." 
 
 " And don't you know any thing 
 further of this foreigner ?'' 
 
 " No, Sir ; I forget what he is called ; 
 — but I see Jenkins going across the 
 street ; shall I run after him and ask 
 him ?" 
 
 " You are very obliging,'* returned 
 the old man ; " but does Jenkins know 
 where the stranger lives ?** 
 
 " No, Sir ; I am sure he don't.'* 
 
 " I am sorry for it," sighed the kind 
 questioner : " then your enquiry would 
 be of no use ; his name will not do, with- 
 out his direction. — Poor fellow ! He has

 been unfortunate, and I might have be- 
 friended him." 
 
 " Yes, to be sure, Doctor,'' cried the 
 first speaker, who now rose to accompany 
 him out : " it is our duty to befriend the 
 unfortunate ; but charity begins at home ; 
 and as all's for the best, perhaps it is 
 lucky we did not hear any more about 
 this young fellow. We might have in- 
 volved ourselves in a vast deal of unne- 
 cessary trouble ; and you know people 
 from outlandish parts have no claims 
 upon us." 
 
 ** Certainly," replied the Doctor, 
 <* none in the world, excepting those 
 which no human creature can dispute ; 
 the claims of nature. All mankind are 
 born heirs of suffering ; and as joint in- 
 heritors, if we do not wipe away each 
 other's tears, it will prove but a comfort- 
 less portion." 
 
 ** Ah ! Doctor," cried his companion, 
 as they separated at the end of Charles- 
 street, " you have always the best of

 the argument : you have logic and Aris- 
 to tie at your finger ends." 
 
 ** No, my friend ; my arguments are 
 purely Christian. Nature is my logic, 
 and the Bible my teacher." 
 
 ** Ah, there you have me again. You 
 parsons are as bad as the lawyers ; when 
 once you get a poor sinner amongst you, 
 he finds it as hard to get out of the church 
 as out of the chancery. However, have 
 it your own way ; charity is your trade, 
 and I won't be in a hurry to dispute the 
 monopoly. Good day. If I stay much 
 longer, you'll make me believe that black 
 is white." 
 
 Dr. Blackmore shook him by the hand, 
 and wishing him a good evening, re- 
 turned home, pitying the worldliness of 
 his friend's mind ; and musing on the 
 interesting stranger, whom he admired, 
 and compassionated with a lively sorrow, 
 for he believed him to be virtuous, un- 
 happy, and unfortunate. Had he known 
 that the object of his solicitude was the

 would have been his regret ; — that he 
 had seen the Count Sobieski ; that he had 
 seen him in distress ; and that he had 
 suffered him to pass from the reach of 
 his services !

 CHAP. XIII. 
 
 1 HE Count Sobieski was cordially re- 
 ceived by his worthy landlady ; indeed 
 he never stood in more need of kindness. 
 A slow fever, which had been gradually 
 creeping over him since he quitted Po- 
 land, settled on his nerves ; and reduced 
 him to such weakness, that he pos- 
 sessed neither strengtli nor spirits to stir 
 abroad. 
 
 Mrs. Robson was greatly distressed at 
 the illness of her guest : her own son, 
 the father of the orphans she protected, 
 had died of a consumption ; and any ap- 
 pearance of that cruel disorder, was a 
 certain call upon her compassion. 
 
 Thaddeus gave himself up to her 
 management : he had no money for

 medical assistance ; and, to please her, 
 he took what little medicines she pre- 
 pared. According to her advice, he re- 
 mained for several days shut up in his 
 chamber, with a large lire, and the shut- 
 ters closed, to exclude the smallest por- 
 tion of that air, which the good woman 
 thought had already stricken him with 
 death. 
 
 But all would not do ; her patient be- 
 came worse and worse. Frightened at 
 the symptoms, Mrs. Robson begged leave 
 to send for the apothecary who had at- 
 tended her deceased son. In this in- 
 stance only, she found the Count obsti- 
 nate : no arguments, nor even her tears, 
 could move him. When she stood weep- 
 ing, and holding his burning hand, his 
 answer was constantly the same. 
 
 ** My excellent Mrs. Robson, do not 
 grieve on my account ; I am not in the

 Can I feel this hand, and see that hectic 
 cheek, without beholding your grave, as 
 it were, opening before me ?" 
 
 She was not much mistaken ; for dur- 
 ing the night after this debate Thaddeus 
 grew so delirious, that no longer able to 
 subdue her terrors, she sent for the apo- 
 thecary to come instantly to her house. 
 
 " O ! Doctor," cried she, as he as- 
 cended the stairs, " I have the best 
 young gentleman ever the sun shone on, 
 dying in that room ! He would not let 
 me send for you ; and now he is raving 
 like a mad creature.'' 
 
 Mr. Vincent entered the Count's hum- 
 ble apartment, and undrew the curtains 
 of the bed. Exhausted by delirium, 
 Thaddeus had sunk senseless on the 
 pillow. At this sight, supposing him 
 dead, Mrs. Robson uttered a shriek, 
 which was echoed by the cries of the 
 little William, who stood near his grand- 
 mother. 
 
 ** Hush, my good woman," said the

 doctor, " the gentleman is not dead ; 
 leave the room till you have recovered 
 yourself, and I will engage that you 
 shall see him alive when you return." 
 
 Considering his words as oracles, she 
 quitted the room with her grandson. 
 
 On entering the chamber, Mr. Vin- 
 cent had felt that the hot and stifling 
 state of the room must augment the 
 fever of his patient ; and, before he at- 
 tempted to disturb him from the tempo- 
 rary rest of insensibility, he opened the 
 window-shutters, unclosed the room-door 
 wide enough to admit the air from the 
 adjoining apartment, and pulling the 
 heavy clothes from the Count's bosom, 
 raised his head on his arm, and poured 
 some drops into his mouth. Sobieski 
 opened his eyes, and uttered a few inco- 
 herent words : but he did not rave, he 
 only wandered ; and appeared to know 
 that he did so ; for he several times 
 stopped in the midst of some confused

 speech, and laying his hand on his fore- 
 head, strove to recollect himself. 
 
 Mrs. Robson soon after entered the 
 room, and poured out her thanks to the 
 apothecary, whom she revered as almost 
 a worker of miracles. 
 
 <* I must bleed him, Mrs. Robson," 
 continued he ; " and for that purpose 
 shall go home for my assistant and lan- 
 cets ; but, in the meanwhile, I charge 
 you to let every thing remain in the 
 state I have left it. The heat alone 
 would have given a fever to a man in 
 health." 
 
 When the apothecary returned he saw 
 that his commands had been strictly 
 obeyed ; and finding that the change of 
 atmosphere had wrought some alteration 
 in his patient, he took his arm without 
 any difficulty, and bled him. At the 
 end of the operation Thaddeus again 
 fainted. 
 
 " Poor gentleman !" cried Mr. Vin- 
 cent, binding up the arm : ** look here,

 Tom," pointing to the scars on the 
 Count's shoulder and breast ; ** see what 
 terrible cuts have been here ! This has 
 not been playing at soldiers! Who is 
 your lodger, Mrs. Robson ?" 
 
 " His name is Constantine, Mr. Vin- 
 cent. But, for Heaven's sake, recover 
 him from that swoon." 
 
 Mr. Vincent poured more drops into 
 his mouth ; and a minute afterwards, he 
 opened his eyes, divested of their fever- 
 ish glare, but still dull and heavy. He 
 spoke to Mrs. Robson by her name ; 
 which gave her such delight, that she 
 caught his hand to her lips, and burst 
 into tears. The action was so instanta- 
 neous and violent, that it made him feel 
 the stiffness of his arm ; and, casting his 
 eyes towards the surgeons, he conjec- 
 tured what had been his state, and what 
 the consequence. 
 
 ** Come, Mrs. Robson," said the apo- 
 thecary, " you must not disturb the gen- 
 tleman. How do you find yourself, Sir ?"

 As the deed could not be recalled, 
 Thaddeus thanked the doctor for the 
 service he had received ; and said a few 
 kind and grateful words to his good 
 hostess. 
 
 Mr. Vincent was glad to see so promis- 
 ing an issue to his proceedings, and 
 soon after retired with his assistant and 
 Mrs. Robson, to give further directions. 
 
 On entering the kitchen, she threw 
 herself into a chair, and broke into a 
 paroxysm of lamentations. 
 
 << My good woman, what is all this 
 about ?" enquired the Doctor. " Is not 
 my patient better ?" 
 
 " Yes," cried she, drying her eyes ; 
 *' but the whole scene puts me so in 
 mind of the last moments of my poor 
 misguided son, that the very sight of it 
 goes through my heart like a knife. 
 Oh ! had my boy been as good as that 
 dear gentleman, had he been as well 
 prepared to die, I think I would scarcely

 have grieved ! Yet Heaven spare Mr. 
 Constantine. Will he Hve ?" 
 
 " I hope so, Mrs. Robson ; his fever 
 is high ; but he is young, and with ex- 
 treme care we may preserve him." 
 
 " The Lord grant it !" cried she, 
 *« for he is the best gentleman I ever 
 beheld. He has been above a week with 
 me ; and till this night, in which he lost 
 his senses, though hardly able to breathe 
 or see, he has read out of books which 
 he brought with him ; and good books 
 too : for it was but yesterday morning 
 that I saw the dear soul sitting by the 
 fire with a book on the table, which he 
 had been studying for an hour : as I was 
 dusting about, I saw him lay his head 
 down on it, and put his hand to his 
 temples. ' Alas ! Sir,' said I, * you tease 
 your brains with these books of learning, 
 when you ought to be taking rest.' — 
 ' No, Mrs. Robson,' returned he, with 
 a sweet smile, ' it is this book which 
 affords me rest — I may amuse myself

 with Others ; but this alone contains per- 
 feet beauty, perfect wisdom, and perfect 
 peace. It is the only infallible soother 
 of human sorrows.' He closed it, and 
 put it on the chimney-piece ; and when 
 I looked at it afterwards, I found it was 
 the Scriptures. — Can you wonder that I 
 should love so excellent a gentleman?'* 
 
 " You have given a strange account 
 of him," replied Vincent : " I hope he 
 is not a methodist ; if so, I shall despair 
 of his cure, and think his delirium had 
 another cause besides fever." 
 
 ** A methodist ! No, Sir : he is a Chris- 
 tian; and as good a reasonable sweet- 
 tempered gentleman, as ever came into 
 a house. Alas ! I believe he is more like 
 a papist ; though they say papists don't 
 read the Bible, but worship images." 
 
 " Why, what reason have you to sup- 
 pose that ? He's an Englishman, is he 
 not?" 
 
 ** No, he is an emigrant." 
 
 **An emigrant ! O, ho!" cried Vincent,

 with a discontented and contemptuous 
 raise of his eye-brows ; what, a poor 
 Frenchman ! Good Lord, how this town 
 is overrun with these fellows !" 
 
 " No, Doctor," exclaimed Mrs. Rob- 
 son, much hurt at this affront to her 
 lodger, whom she really loved, " whatever 
 he be, he is not poor^ for he has a power 
 of fine things : he has got a watch all 
 over diamonds, and diamond rings, and 
 diamond pictures without number. So, 
 Doctor, you need not fear you are at- 
 tending him for charity j no, I would sell 
 my gown first." 
 
 " Nay, don't be offended, Mrs. Rob- 
 son ! I meant no offence," returned he, 
 much mollified by this explanation ; 
 " but really, when we see the bread that 
 should feed our children, and our own 
 poor, eaten up by a parcel of lazy French 
 drones, who cover our land and destroy 
 its produce like a swarm of filthy locusts, 
 we should be fools not to murmur. But,

 Mrs. Robson ? is a different sort of a 
 body." 
 
 ** Mr. Constantine/' replied she, " and 
 indeed he is ; and no doubt, when you 
 recover him, he wdll pay you as though 
 he were in his own country." 
 
 This last assertion banished all remain- 
 ing suspicion from the apothecary ; and, 
 after giving the good w^oman what orders 
 he thought requisite, he returned home, 
 promising to call in the evening. 
 
 Mrs. Robson went up stairs to the 
 Count's chamber, with other sentiments 
 towards her sapient doctor than those 
 with which she came down. She well 
 recollected the substance of his dis- 
 course ; and she gathered from it, that 
 however clever he might be in his pro- 
 fession, he was a hard-hearted man, who 
 would rather see a fellow-creature perish, 
 than administer relief to him without a 
 reward. 
 
 But here Mrs. Robson was mistaken. 
 She did him justice in esteeming his me-

 dical abilities, which were great : he had 
 made medicine the study of his Hfe ; and, 
 not allowing any other occupation to dis- 
 turb his attention, he became master of 
 that science, but remained ignorant of 
 every other with which it had no con- 
 nection. He was the father of a family j 
 and, in the usual acceptation of the term, 
 a very good sort of a man ; he preferred 
 his country to every other, because it was 
 his country : he loved his wife and his 
 children : he was kind to the poor, to 
 whom he gave his advice gratis, and let- 
 ters to the Dispensary for drugs; and 
 when he had any broken victuals to spare, 
 he desired that it might be divided 
 amongst them ; but he seldom caught 
 his maid obeying this part of his com- 
 mands, without reprimanding her for her 
 extravagance in giving away what ought 
 to be eaten in the kitchen : — "in these 
 times it was a shame to waste a crumb ; 
 and the careless hussey would come to

 want, for thinking so lightly of other 
 people's property." 
 
 Thus, like many in the world, he was 
 a loyal citizen by habit, an affectionate 
 father from nature, and a man of charity, 
 because he now and then felt pity, and 
 now and then heard it preached from the 
 pulpit. He was exhorted to be pious, 
 and to pour wine and oil into the wounds 
 of his neighbour ; but it never once 
 struck him, that piety extended farther 
 than going to church, mumbling his 
 prayers, and forgetting the sermon, 
 through most of which he generally 
 slept : and his commentaries on the 
 Good Samaritan were not more exten- 
 sive ; for it was so difficult to make him 
 comprehend who was his neighbour, that 
 the object of the argument might have 
 been sick, dead, and buried before he 
 could be persuaded that he had any 
 claims on his care. Indeed, his " cha- 
 rity began at home ;'' and it was so fond 
 of its residence, that it ** stopped there."

 any man be mad enough to take the

 favourite metaphors, when he spoke of 
 the unhappy French, or of any other 
 pennyless foreigners that came in his 
 way. 
 
 After this explanation, it will appear 
 paradoxical to mention an inconsistency 
 in the mind of Mr. Vincent, which never 
 permitted him to discover the above 
 Cainish mark of outlawry, upon the 
 wealthy stranger of whatever country. 
 In fact, it was with him as with many :

 away, and probably the poor stripped 
 wretch would be treated worse than a 
 criminal. 
 
 That his new patient possessed some 
 property, was sufficient to ensure the re- 
 spect and medical skill of Mr. Vincent ; 
 and when he entered his own house, he 
 told his wife he had found " a very good 
 job at Mrs. Robson's, in the illness of 
 her lodger." 
 
 When the Count Sobieski quitted the 
 Hummums on the evening in which he 
 brought away his baggage, he was so dis- 
 concerted by the impertinence of the man 
 who accosted him there, that he deter- 
 mined not to expose himself to a similar 
 insult by retaining a title which might 
 subject him to the curiosity of the insolent 
 and insensible ; and, therefore, when Mrs. 
 Robson asked him how she should address 
 him, as he was averse to assume a feigned 
 name, he merely said Mr, Constantine, 
 
 Under that unobtrusive character, he 
 hoped in time to accommodate his ^qqU

 iiigs to the change of fortune which Pro- 
 vidence had allotted to him. He must 
 forget his nobility, his pride, and his sen- 
 sibility; he must earn his subsistence. 
 But by what means ? He was ignorant of 
 business ; and he knew not how to turn 
 his accomplishments to account. — Such 
 were his meditations, until illness and 
 delirium deprived him of them and of 
 reason together. 
 
 At the expiration of a week, in which 
 Mr, Vincent attended his patient very 
 regularly, Sobieski was able to remove 
 into the front room ; but uneasiness 
 about the debts he had so unintentionally 
 incurred, retarded his recovery ; and 
 made his hours pass away in cheerless 
 meditation on the means of repaying the 
 good widow, and of satisfying the avidity 
 of the apothecary. Pecuniary obligation 
 was a load to which he was unaccustomed ; 
 and once or twice the wish almost escaped 
 his heart, that he had died.

 Whenever he was left to think, such 
 were his reflections. Mrs. Robson dis- 
 covered that he appeared more feverish 
 and had worse nights after being much 
 alone during the day, and therefore con- 
 trived, though she was obliged to be in 
 her little shop, to leave either Nanny to 
 attend his wants, or little WiUiam to 
 amuse him. 
 
 This child, by its uncommon quick- 
 ness, and artless manner, gained upon the 
 Count, who was ever alive to helplessness 
 and innocence. Children and animals 
 had always found a friend and protector 
 in him. From the ^^ majestic war-horse, 
 with his neck clothed in thunder ," to 
 " the poor beetle that we tread upon ;" 
 every creature of creation, met an ad- 
 vocate of mercy in his breast: and as 
 human nature is prone to love what it 
 has been kind to, Thaddeus never saw 
 either children, dogs, or even that poor 
 .slandered and abused animal, the cat,

 without showing them some spontaneous 
 act of attention. 
 
 Whatever of his affection he could spare 
 from memory, the Count lavished upon 
 the little William. He hardly ever left 
 his side, where he sat on a stool, prattling 
 about any thing that came into his head ; 
 or, seated on his knee, followed with his 
 eyes and playful fingers the hand of 
 Thaddeus, as he sketched a horse or a 
 soldier for his pretty companion.

 JDY these means Thaddeus slowly ac- 
 quired sufficient strength to allow hun to 
 quit his dressing-gown, and prepare for 
 a walk. 
 
 A hard frost succeeded to the chilling 
 damps of November ; and looking out of 
 tlie window, he longed, almost eagerly, 
 again to inhale the fresh air. After some 
 tender altercations with Mrs. Robson, 
 who feared to trust him even down stairs, 
 he at length conquered ; and taking the 
 little William in his hand, folded his 
 pelisse round him, and promising to 
 venture no farther than the King's Mews, 
 was suffered to go out. 
 
 As he expected, he found the keen 
 breeze act like a charm on his debilitated 
 frame ; and with braced nerves and ex- 
 hilarated spirits he walked twice up and 
 down the place, whilst his companion

 played before him, throwing stones and 
 running to pick them up. At this mo- 
 ment one of the King's carriages, pur- 
 sued by a concourse of people, suddenly 
 drove in at the Charing-cross gate. 
 The frightened child screamed and fell. 
 Thaddeus darted forward, and seizing 
 the heads of the horses, which were 
 within a yard of the boy, stopped them ; 
 meanwhile, the mob gathering about, 
 one of them raised William, who con- 
 tinued his cries. The Count now let 
 go the reins, and for a few minutes tried 
 to pacify his little charge ; but finding 
 that his alarm and shrieks were not to 
 be quelled, and that his own figure, 
 from its singularity of dress, (his high 
 cap and feathers adding to his height,) 
 drew on him the whole attention of the 
 people, he took the trembling child in 
 his arms, and walking through the 
 Mews, was followed by some of the bye- 
 standers to the very door of Mrs. Rob- 
 son's shop.

 Seeing the people, and her grandson 
 sobbing on the breast of her guest, she 
 ran out, and hastily asked what had 
 happened. Thaddeus simply answered, 
 the child had been frightened. But 
 when they entered the house, and he 
 had thrown himself exhausted on a seat, 
 William, as he stood by his knee, told 
 his grandmother, that if Mr. Constantine 
 had not stopped the horses, he must have 
 been run over. The Count was now 
 obliged to relate the whole story; which 
 ended with the blessings of the poor 
 woman, for his goodness in risking his 
 own life for the preservation of her dar- 
 ling child. 
 
 Thaddeus in vain assured her the ac* 
 tion deserved no thanks. 
 
 " Well," cried she, " it is like your- 
 self, Mr. Constantine : you think all your 
 good deeds nothing ; and yet any little 
 odd thing that I can do out of pure love 
 to serve you, you cry up to the skies.

 Has your walk refreshed you? But I need 
 not ask ; you have got a fine colour." 
 
 " Yes," returned he, rising and taking 
 off his cap and cloak, ** it has put me 
 in a glow, and made me quite another 
 creature." As he finished speaking, he 
 dropped the things from the hand that 
 held them, and staggered back a few 
 paces against the wall. 
 
 **Good Lord! what is the matter?" 
 cried Mrs. Robson, looking in his face, 
 which was now as pale as death ; « what 
 is the matter ?" 
 
 "Nothing, nothing," returned he, re- 
 covering himselfj and gathering up the 
 cloak he had let fall, " don't mind me, 
 Mrs. Robson ; nothing :" and he was 
 leaving the kitchen, but she followed 
 him, terrified at his look and manner. 
 
 " Pray, Mr. Constantine !" 
 
 "Nay, my dear madam," said he, lead- 
 ing her back, "I am not well; I believe 
 my walk has overcome me. Let me be

 myself. It will oblige me." 
 
 •* Well, Sir, as you please !" and 
 then, laying her withered hand fearfully 
 upon his arm, "forgive me, dear Sir,'* 
 said she, " if my attentions are trouble- 
 some. Indeed, I fear, that sometimes 
 great love appears like great imperti- 
 nence ; I would always be serving you, 
 and therefore I often forget the wide 
 difference between Your Honour's station 
 and mine." 
 
 The Count could only press her hand 
 gratefully, and with an emotion that 
 made him hurry up stairs. When in his 
 own room, he shut the door, and cast a 
 wild and inquisitive gaze around the 
 apartment ; then throwing himself into 
 a chair, he struck his head with his hand, 
 and exclaimed, ** It is gone ! What will 
 become of me? Of this poor woman, 
 whose substance I have consumed?" 
 
 It was true, the watch, by the sale of

 charges of his illness, was indeed lost. 
 A villain, in the crowd, having perceived 
 the sparkling of the chain, had taken it 
 unobserved from his side; and he knew 
 nothing of his loss, until feeling for his 
 watch to see the hour, he discovered his 
 misfortune. 
 
 The shock went like a stroke of elec- 
 tricity through his frame; but it was not 
 until the last glimmering of hope was ex- 
 tinguished, on examining his room where 
 he thought he might have left it, that he 
 saw the full horror of his situation. 
 
 He sat for some minutes, absorbed, and 
 almost afraid to think. It was not his 
 own, but the necessities of the poor 
 woman, who had, perhaps, incurred 
 debts on herself to afford him comforts, 
 which bore so hard upon him. At last, 
 rising from his seat, he exclaimed, 
 
 " I must determine on something. 
 Since this is gone, I must seek what else 
 I have to part with, for 1 cannot long 
 bear my present feelings."

 He opened the drawer which contained 
 his few valuables. 
 
 With a trembling hand he took them out 
 one by one. There were several trinkets 
 which had been given to him by his mo- 
 ther ; and a pair of inlaid pistols, which 
 his grandfather put into his belt on the 
 morning of the dreadful tenth of October ; 
 his miniature lay beneath them : the mild 
 eyes of the Palatine seemed beaming with 
 affection upon his grandson : Thaddeus 
 snatched it up, kissed it fervently, and 
 then laid it back into the drawer, whilst 
 he hid his face with his hands. 
 
 When he recovered himself, he replaced 
 the pistols, believing that it would be sa- 
 crilege to part with them. Without al- 
 lowing himself time to think, he put a 
 gold pencil-case and a pair of brilliant 
 sleeve-buttons into his waistcoat-pocket. 
 
 He descended the stairs with a soft 
 
 step, and passing the kitchen-door un- 
 
 perceived by his landlady, crossed through 
 
 a little court j and then anxiously look-

 ing from right to left, to find any place 
 in which he might probably dispose of 
 the trinkets, he took his way up Castle- 
 street, and along Leicester-square. 
 
 When he turned up the first street to 
 his right, he was impeded by two persons 
 who stood in his path, the one selling, 
 the other buying a hat. The thought 
 immediately struck Thaddeus of asking 
 one of these men (who appeared to be 
 a Jew and a vender of clothes) to pur- 
 chase his pelisse. By parting with a 
 thing to which he annexed no more value 
 than the warmth it afforded him, he 
 should possibly spare himself the pain, 
 for this time at least, of sacrificing those 
 gifts of his mother which had been be- 
 stowed upon him in happier days, and 
 hallowed by her caresses. 
 
 He did not permit himself to hesitate, 
 but desired the Jew to follow him into a 
 neighbouring court. The man obeyed ; 
 and having no ideas independent of his 
 trade, asked the Count what he wanted 
 to buy ?

 " Nothing : I want to sell this pe- 
 lisse,'* returned he, opening it. The 
 Jew, without any ceremony, inspected 
 the covering and the fur. 
 
 " Aye, I see it is black cloth, lined 
 with sable; but who would buy it of me? 
 It is embroidered, and nobody wears 
 such things here." 
 
 ** Then I am answered," replied Thad- 
 deus. 
 
 "Stop, Sir," cried the Jew, pursuing 
 him ; ** what will you take for it ?" 
 
 " What would you give me ?" 
 
 ** Let me see. It is very long and wide. 
 At the utmost I cannot offer you more 
 than five guineas." 
 
 A few months ago, it had cost the 
 Count a hundred ; but glad to get any 
 money, however small, he readily closed 
 with the man's price y and, taking off the 
 cloak, gave it to him, and put the guineas 
 into his pocket. 
 
 He had not walked much farther, be- 
 fore the piercing cold of the evening,

 and a shower of snow, which began to 
 fall, made him feel the effects of his loss ; 
 however that did not annoy him ; he had 
 been too heavily assailed by the pityless 
 rigours of misfortune, to regard the 
 pelting of the elements. Whilst the 
 wind blew in his face, and the sleet fall- 
 ing on his dress, lodged in its embroi- 
 dered lappels, he went forward, calcu- 
 lating whether it were likely that this 
 money, with the few shillings he yet pos- 
 sessed, would be sufficient to discharge 
 what he owed. Unused as he had been 
 to all kinds of expenditure which re- 
 quired attention, he supposed from what 
 he had already seen of a commerce with 
 the world, that the sum he had received 
 from the Jew was not above half what he 
 wanted; and with a beating heart he 
 walked towards, one of those shops, 
 which Mrs. Robson had described, when 
 speaking of the irregularities of her son, 
 who had nearly reduced her to beggary,. 
 The candles were lit. And, as he ho-

 vered about the door, he distinctly saw 
 the master through the glass, assorting 
 some parcels on the counter. He was a 
 gentleman-like man ; and the Count's 
 feelings took quite a different turn from 
 those with which he had accosted the 
 Jew J who, being a low sordid wretch, 
 looked upon the people with whom he 
 trafficked as pieces of wood. Thaddeus 
 felt little repugnance at bargaining with 
 him : but the sight of a respectable per- 
 son, before whom he was to present him- 
 self as a man in poverty, as one who in a 
 manner appealed to charity, all at once 
 overcame the resolution of Sobieski, and 
 he debated whether or not he should re- 
 turn. Mrs. Robson, and her probable 
 distresses, rose before him j and, fearful 
 of trusting his pride any farther, he pulled 
 his cap over his face, and entered the 
 shop. 
 
 The man bowed very civilly on his eii- 
 trance, and requested to be honoured 
 with his commands. Thaddeus felt his

 face glow; but indignant at his own 
 weakness, he laid the gold case on the 
 counter, and said, in a voice which, not- 
 withstanding his emotion, he compelled 
 to be without appearance of confusion, 
 "I want to part with this.'* 
 
 Astonished at the dignity of his air, 
 and the nobility of his dress, for the star 
 did not escape the shopkeeper's eye, he 
 looked at him for a moment, holding the 
 case in his hand. Hurt by the steadiness 
 of his gaze, the Count rather haughtily 
 repeated what he had said. The man 
 hesitated no longer. He had been ac- 
 customed to similar requests from the 
 emigrant French noblesse : but there was 
 a loftiness, and an air of authority in the 
 countenance and mien of this person, 
 which surprised and awed him ; and with 
 a respect which even the application 
 could not counteract, he opened the case, 
 and inquired of Thaddeus, what was the 
 price he affixed to it. 
 
 '< I leave that to you," replied he.

 " The gold is solid," returned the 
 man, " but it is very thin ; I cannot give 
 more than three guineas. Though the 
 workmanship is tine, it is not in the 
 fashion of England, and will be of no 
 benefit to me till it is melted. 
 
 " You may have it," said Thaddeus, 
 hardly able to articulate, as he saw the 
 gift of his mother pass into a stranger's 
 hand. 
 
 The man directly paid him down the 
 money, and the Count with a bursting 
 heart darted out of the shop. 
 
 Mrs. Robson was shutting up the win- 
 dows of her little parlour, when he hastily 
 passed her, and glided up the stairs. 
 Hardly believing her senses, she hastened 
 after him, and just got into the room as 
 he drank off a glass of water. 
 
 ** Good Lord, Sir," cried she; 
 ** where has Your Honour been? I 
 thought you were all the while in the 
 house, and I would not come near, 
 though I was very uneasy ; and there

 has been poor William crying himself 
 blind, because you desired to be left 
 alone." 
 
 Thaddeus was unprepared to make an 
 answer. He was in hopes to have gotten 
 in as he had stolen out, undiscovered ; 
 for he determined not to agitate her good 
 mind, by the history of his loss. He would 
 not allow her to know any thing of his 
 embarrassments, from a sentiment of jus- 
 tice, as well as from that pride, which all 
 his sufferings and philosophy could not 
 wholly subdue. 
 
 " I have been taking a walk, Mrs. 
 Robson." 
 
 " Dear heart! I thought when you 
 staggered back, and looked so ill, after 
 you brought in William, you had over- 
 walked yourself!'* 
 
 " No; I fancy my fears had a little 
 discomposed me j and I hoped that more 
 air might do me good ; I tried it, and it 
 has : but I am grieved for having alarmed

 This ambiguous speech satisfied his 
 kind landlady ; and, fatigued by a bodily 
 exertion, which, in the present feeble 
 state of his frame, nothing less than the 
 perturbation of his mind could have car- 
 ried him through, Thaddeus went di- 
 rectly to bed ; where tired nature soon 
 found temporary repose in a profound 
 sleep.

 1\ext morning, Sobieski found himself 
 rather better than worse by the exertions 
 of the preceding day. When Nanny ap- 
 peared as usual with his breakfast, and 
 little William, (who always sat on his 
 knee, and shared his bread and butter,) 
 he desired her to request her grand- 
 mother to send to Mr. Vincent with his 
 compliments, and to tell him, he was so 
 well at present as to decline any farther 
 medical aid, and therefore wished to 
 have his bill. 
 
 Mrs. Robson, who could not forget the 
 behaviour of the apothecary, undertook 
 to deliver the message herself, happy in 
 the triumphs she should enjoy over the 
 littleness of Mr. Vincent's suspicions. 
 
 After the lapse of a quarter of an hour,

 she re-appeared in the Count's rooms 
 with the apothecary's assistant ; who, 
 with many thanks, received the sum total 
 of his accompt, which amounted to three 
 guineas for ten days' attendance. 
 
 The man having withdrawn, Thaddeus 
 told Mrs. Robson, he should next defray 
 the smallest part of the vast debt, he 
 must ever owe to her parental care. 
 
 " O, bless your Honour ; it goes to my 
 heart to take a farthing of you ! but 
 •these poor children," cried she, laying a 
 hand on each, and her eyes glistening ; 
 " they look up to me as their all here j 
 and my quarter-day was yesterday, else, 
 dear Sir, I should scorn to be like Doctor 
 Vincent, and take your money the moment 
 you offer it." 
 
 « My good madam," returned Sobieski, 
 giving her a chair, "I am sensible of 
 your kindness : but it is your just due j 
 and the payment of it can never lessen 
 my gratitude for the friendship which you 
 have shown to me, a poor stranger,"

 " Then, there, Sir," said she, look- 
 ing almost as ashamed as if she were 
 robbing him, when she laid it on the 
 table ; " there is my bill. I have regu^ 
 larly set down every thing. Nanny will 
 bring it to me." And quite disconcerted, 
 the good woman hurried out of the 
 room. 
 
 Thaddeus looked after her with admir- 
 ation and reverence. 
 
 " There goes," thought he, " in that 
 lowly and feeble frame, as generous and 
 noble a spirit as ever animated the breast 
 of a princess ! — Here, Nanny," said he, 
 glancing his eye over the paper, «« there 
 is the gold, with my thanks ; and tell 
 your grandmother I am astonished at her 
 economy." 
 
 This affair over, the Count was re- 
 lieved of a grievous load 5 and turning 
 the remaining money in his hand, how 
 he might replenish the little stock before 
 it were expended, next occupied his 
 attention. Notwithstanding the pawn*

 broker's civil treatment, he recoiled at 
 again presenting himself at his shop. Be- 
 sides, should he dispose of all that he pos- 
 sessed, it would not be of sufficient value 
 to subsist him for a month. He must think 
 of some source within himself that was 
 not likely to be so soon exhausted. To 
 be reduced a second time to the misery 
 which he had endured yesterday, from 
 suspense and wretchedness, appeared too 
 dreadful to be hazarded, and he ran 
 over in his memory the different merits 
 of his several accomplishments. 
 
 He could not make any use of his mu- 
 sical talents, for at public exhibitions of 
 himself, his soul revolted ; and as to his 
 literary acquirements, his youth, and be- 
 ing a foreigner, precluded all hopes on 
 that head. At length he found that his 
 sole dependence must rest on his talents 
 for painting. Of this art he had always 
 been remarkably fond ; and his taste 
 easily perceived that there were many 
 drawings exhibited for sale, much in^

 ferior to those which he had executed for 
 mere amusement. 
 
 He decided at once ; and purchasing, 
 by the means of Nanny, pencils and In- 
 dian ink, he set to work. 
 
 When he had finished half-a-dozen 
 drawings, and was considering how he 
 might find the street in which he had 
 seen the print-shops, the recollection oc- 
 curred to him of the impression his ap- 
 pearance had made on the pawnbroker. 
 He perceived the wide difference between 
 his apparel and the fashion of England ; 
 and seeing with what security from im- 
 pertinence he might walk about, could 
 he so far cast off the relics of his former 
 rank as to change his dress, he got up 
 with an intention to go out and purchase 
 a surtout coat and hat, for that purpose; 
 but catching an accidental view of his 
 figure and the star of St. Stanislaus, as 
 he passed the glass to the door, he no 
 longer wondered at the curiosity which 
 such an appendage, united with poverty^

 had attracted. Rather than again sub- 
 ject himself to a similar situation, he 
 summoned his young messenger ; and, 
 by her assistance, furnished himself with 
 an English hat and coat, whilst, with his 
 penknife, he cut away the embroidery of 
 the order, from the cloth to which it was 
 affixed. 
 
 Thus accoutred with his hat flapped 
 over his face, and his great coat wrapped 
 round him, he put his drawings into his 
 bosom, and about eight o'clock walked 
 out on his disagreeable errand. After 
 some wearying search, he at last found 
 Great Newport-street, the place he 
 wanted ; but as he advanced, his hopes 
 died away, and his fears and reluctance 
 awakened. 
 
 He stopped at the door of the nearest 
 print-shop. All that he had suffered at 
 the pawnbroker's re-assailed him with 
 redoubled violence. What he presented 
 there possessed a fixed value, and was at 
 once to be taken or refused ; but now he

 310 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 was going to offer things of mere taste, 
 and he might meet not only with a denial, 
 but affronting remarks. 
 
 He walked to the threshold of the door, 
 then as hastily withdrew, and hurried two 
 or three paces down the street. 
 
 «* Weak, contemptible that I am!" said 
 he to himself, as he again turned round, 
 " where is all my reason and rectitude of 
 principle, that I would rather endure the 
 misery of dependence and self-reproach, 
 than dare the attempt to seek support 
 from the fruits of my own industry ?" 
 
 He quickened his step, and started into 
 the shop, almost fearful of his former 
 irresolution. He threw his drawings in- 
 stantly upon the counter. 
 
 " Sir, you purchase drawings. I have 
 these to sell. Will they suit you ?'* 
 
 The man took them up without deign- 
 ing to look at the person who accosted 
 him, and turning them over in his hand, 
 " One, two, three, hum ! there is half-a- 
 dozen. What do you expect for them?'*

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 311 
 
 "I am not acquainted with the prices 
 of these things." 
 
 The printseller, hearing this, thought, 
 by managing well, to get them for what 
 he liked, and throwing them over with an 
 air of contempt, resumed, 
 
 " And pray, where may the views be 
 taken ?" 
 
 " They are recollections of scenes in 
 Germany." 
 
 " Ah," replied the man, "mere drugs] 
 I wish, honest friend, you could have 
 brought subjects not quite so threadbare, 
 and a little better executed ; they are 
 but poor things ! But every dauber, now- 
 a-days, sets up for a fine artist ; and 
 thinks tjoe are to ^ay him for idleness and 
 conceit." 
 
 Insulted by this speech, and, above all, 
 by the manner of the printseller, Thad- 
 deus was snatching up the drawings to 
 leave the shop without a word, when the 
 man observing his design, and afraid to

 31^ THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 lose them, laid his hand on the heap, ex- 
 claiming, 
 
 ** Let me tell you, young man, it does 
 not become a person in your situation to 
 be so huffy to their employers. I will 
 give you a guinea for the six, and you 
 may think yourself well paid." 
 
 Without further hesitation, whilst the 
 Count was striving to subdue the choler 
 w^hich urged him to knock him down, 
 tlie man laid the gold on the counter, 
 and was slipping the drawings into a 
 drawer ; but Thaddeus snatching them 
 out again, suddenly rolled them up, and 
 walked out of the shop as he said : 
 
 " Not all the money, of all your tribe, 
 would tempt an honest man to pollute 
 himself by exchanging a second word 
 with one so contemptible." 
 
 Irritated at this unfeeling treatment, 
 he returned home too much provoked to 
 think of the consequences which might 
 Ibllow a similar disappointment.

 Having become used to the fluctu- 
 ations of his looks and behaviour, the 
 widow ceased altogether to tease him 
 with enquiries she saw he was loth to 
 answer. She now allowed him to walk in 
 and out without a remark ; and silently 
 contemplated his pale and melancholy 
 countenance, when, after a ramble of 
 the greatest part of the day, he returned 
 home exhausted and dispirited. 
 
 William was always the first to welcome 
 his friend at the threshold, by running to 
 him, taking hold of his coat, and asking 
 to go with him up stairs. The Count 
 usually gratified him ; and brightened 
 many dull hours, with his innocent 
 caresses. 
 
 This child was literally his only earthly 
 comfort ; for he saw that in him, he 
 could still excite those emotions of hap- 
 piness which had once afforded him his 
 sweetest joy. William ever greeted him 
 with smiles ; and when he entered the 
 kitchen, sprang to his bosom, as if that

 were the seat of peace, as it was of 
 virtue. But, alas ! fate seemed averse to 
 lend any thing long to the unhappy 
 Thaddeus, which might render his deso^ 
 late state more tolerable. 
 
 Just risen from the bed of sickness, he 
 required the hand of some tender nurse 
 to restore his wasted vigour, instead of 
 being reduced to the hard vigils of 
 poverty and want. His recent disap* 
 pointment, added to a cold which he 
 caught, increased his fever and debility ; 
 yet he adhered to the determination, not 
 to appropriate to his own subsistence, 
 the few valuables he had assigned as a 
 deposit for the charges of his rent* 
 During a fortnight he never tasted any 
 thing better than bread and water ; but 
 this hermit's fare was accompanied by 
 the thought, that if it ended in death, 
 his sufferings would then be over ; and 
 the widow amply remunerated by what 
 little of his property remained. 
 
 In this state of body and mind he re*

 ceived a most painful shock, when one 
 evening returning from a walk of many 
 hours, in the place of his little favourite, 
 he met Mrs. Robson in tears at the door. 
 She told him William had been sickening 
 all the day, and was now so delirious, that 
 neither she nor his sister could hold him 
 quiet. 
 
 Thaddeus went to the side of the child's 
 bed, where he lay gasping on the pillow, 
 held down by the crying Nanny. The 
 Count touched his cheek. 
 
 " Poor child," exclaimed he, " he is in 
 a high fever. Have you sent for Mr, 
 Vincent ?" 
 
 " O, no J I had not the heart to leave 
 him," 
 
 " Then I will go directly," returned 
 Thaddeus ; *' there is not a moment to 
 be lost." 
 
 The poor woman thanked him. Hasten- 
 ing through the streets with an eagerness 
 which nearly overset several of the foot- 
 passengers, he arrived at Lincoln's Inn

 316 THADDEUS OF WARSAW, 
 
 Fields J and in less than five minutes 
 after he had quitted Mrs. Robson's door, 
 he returned with the apothecary. 
 
 On Mr. Vincent's examining the pulse 
 and countenance of his little patient, he 
 declared the symptoms to be the small- 
 pox, which some casualty had repelled. 
 
 In a paroxysm of distress, Mrs. Robson 
 recollected that a girl had been brought 
 into her shop three days ago, just re* 
 covered from that frightful malady. 
 
 Thaddeus tried to subdue the fears of 
 the grandmother ; and at last succeeded 
 in persuading her to go to bed, whilst h€5. 
 and Nanny would watch by the pillow of 
 the invalid. 
 
 Towards morning the disorder broke 
 out in tlie child's face, and he recovered 
 his recollection. The moment he fixed 
 his eyes on the Count, who was leaning 
 over him, he stretched out his little arms 
 and begged to lie on his breast. Thad- 
 deus refused him gently, fearing that by 
 any change of position, he might catch

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 31^' 
 
 cold, and so again retard what had now 
 so fortunately appeared ; but the poor 
 child thought the denial unkind, and 
 began to weep so violently, that his 
 anxious friend believed it better to gra- 
 tify him than hazard the irritation of his 
 fever by agitation and crying. 
 
 Thaddeus took him out of bed, and, 
 rolling him in one of the blankets, laid 
 him in his bosom, and drawing his dress- 
 ing gown, to shield his little face from 
 the fire, held him in that situation asleep 
 &r nearly two hours. 
 
 When Mrs. Robson came down stairs 
 at six o*clock in the morning, she kissed 
 the hand of the Count as he sustained 
 her grandson in his arms; and, almost 
 speechless with gratitude to him, and so- 
 licitude for the child, waited the arrival 
 of the apothecary. 
 
 On his second visit, he said a few words 
 to her of comfort ; but whispered to the 
 Count, as he was feeling William's pulse, 
 P 3

 318 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 that nothing short of the strictest care 
 could save the boy, the infection he had 
 received having been of the most malig- 
 nant kind. 
 
 These words fell like an unrepealable 
 sentence on the heart of Thaddeus. 
 Looking on the discoloured features of 
 the patient infant, he fancied that he al- 
 ready beheld his clay-cold face, and its 
 little limb stretched in death. The idea 
 was bitterness to him ; and pressing the 
 boy to his breast, he resolved that no at* 
 tention should be wanting on his part, to 
 preserve him from the grave. And he 
 kept his- promise. 
 
 From that hour until the day in which 
 the poor babe expired in his arms, he 
 never laid him out of them for ten mi- 
 nutes together : and when he did breathe 
 his last sigh, and raised up his little eyes, 
 Thaddeus met their dying glance with a 
 pang, which he thought his soul had long 
 lost the power to feel. His heart seemed 
 to stop ; and covering the motionless face

 of the dead child with his hand, he made 
 a sign to Nanny to leave the room. 
 
 The girl, who from respect had been 
 accustomed to obey his slightest nod, 
 went to her grandmother in the shop. 
 
 The instant the girl quitted the room, 
 with mingled awe and grief the Count 
 lifted the Httle corpse from his knee; 
 and without allowing himself to cast 
 another glance on the face of the poor 
 infant now released from suffering, he 
 put it on the bed, and throwing the 
 sheet over it, sunk into a chair and burst 
 into tears. 
 
 The entrance of Mrs. Robson in some 
 measure restored him ; for the moment 
 she perceived her guest with his handker- 
 chief over his eyes, she judged what had 
 happened, and with a piercing scream 
 flew forward to the bed, where pulling 
 down the covering, she uttered another 
 shriek, and must have fallen on the floor 
 had not Thaddeus and little Nanny, who

 ran in at her cries, caught her in their 
 arms and bore her to a chair. 
 
 Her soul was too much agitated to 
 allow her to continue long in a state of 
 insensibility ; and when she recovered, 
 she would again have approached the 
 deceased child, but the Count withheld 
 her, and, trying by every means in his 
 power to soothe her, so far succeeded as 
 to melt her agonies into tears. 
 
 Whilst she concealed her venerable 
 head in the bosom of her grand-daughter, 
 he once more lifted the remains of the 
 little William j and thinking it best, for the 
 tranquillity of the unhappy grandmother, 
 to take him out of her sight, carried him 
 up stairs and laid him on his own bed. 
 
 By tlie time he returned to the humble 
 parlour, one of the female neighbours 
 having heard an unusual outcry, and sus- 
 pecting the cause, kindly stepped in to 
 offer her consolation and services. Mrs. 
 Robson could only reply by sobs, which 
 were answered by the loud weeping of

 poor Nanny, who lay with her head 
 against the table. ^ 
 
 When the Count came down he 
 thanked the good woman for her bene- 
 volent intentions, and took her up stairs 
 into his apartments. Pointing to the 
 open door of the bed-room, '« There^ 
 Madam," said he, " you will find the 
 remains of my dear little friend. I beg 
 you will direct every thing for his inter- 
 ment, as you think will give satisfaction 
 to Mi's. Robson. I would spare that ex- 
 cellent woman every pang in my power." 
 
 All was done according to his desire j 
 and Mrs. Watts, the charitable neighbour, 
 excited by a good disposition and rever- 
 ence for " the extraordinary young gen- 
 tleman who lodged with her friend," 
 performed her task with kindness and 
 activity. 
 
 <* O ! Sir," cried Mrs. Robson, weep- 
 ing afresh as she entered the Count's 
 room, " O ! Sir, how shall I ever repay 
 all your goodness ? and Mrs. Watts ? She

 has acted like a sister to me. But in- 
 deed, indeed, I am yet the most miser- 
 able woman that lives. I have lost my 
 dearest child, and must strip his poor 
 sister and myself to bury him. That 
 cruel Dr. Vincent, though he might have 
 imagined my distress, sent his accompt 
 late last night, saying he wanted to make 
 up a large bill, and he wished I would let 
 him have all or part of the payment. 
 Heaven knows, I have not a farthing in 
 the house ; but I will send poor little 
 Nanny to pawn my silver spoons ; for, 
 alas ! I have no other means of satisfying 
 the cruel man." 
 
 " Rapacious wretch !" cried Thad- 
 deus, rising indignantly from his chair, 
 and for a moment forgetting how inca- 
 pable he was to afford relief: " you shall 
 not be indebted one instant to his mercy. 
 I will pay him." 
 
 The words had passed his lips : he 
 could not retract, though conviction im- 
 mediately followed, that he had not the

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 3Q3 
 
 means ; and he would not have retracted 
 even should he be necessitated to part 
 with every thing he most valued. 
 
 Mrs. Robson was overwhelmed by this 
 generous promise, which indeed saved 
 her from ruin. Had her little plate been 
 pledged, it could not have covered one 
 half of Mr. Vincent's demaud, who, to 
 do him justice, did not mean to cause 
 any distress. But having been so readily 
 paid by Thaddeus for his own illness, 
 and observing his great care and affec* 
 tion for the deceased child, he did not 
 doubt, that rather than allow Mrs. Rob- 
 son a minute's uneasiness, her lodger 
 would defray his bill. So far he calcu- 
 lated right ; but he had not sufficient 
 sagacity to foresee, that in getting his 
 money this way, he should lose the future 
 business of Mrs. Robson and her friend. 
 
 The child was to be buried on the mor- 
 row ; the expenses of which event, Thad- 
 deus saw he must discharge also ; — and 
 he had engaged to pay Mr. Vincent that

 night. He had not a shilling in his purse. 
 Over and over, he contemplated the im- 
 practicability of answering these debts 5 
 yet he could not for an instant repent 
 of what he had undertaken : he thought 
 he was amply recompensed for bearing 
 so heavy a load, in knowing that he had 
 taken it off the worn- down heart of an- 
 other.

 feiNCE the Count's unmannerly treatment 
 at the printseller's, he had not sufficiently 
 conquered his pride, to attempt an appli- 
 cation to another. Therefore, he had no 
 prospect of collecting the money he had 
 pledged himself to Mrs. Robson to pay, 
 but by selling some more of his valuables 
 to the pawnbroker. 
 
 For this purpose he took his sabre, his 
 pistols, and the fated brilhants he had 
 brought back on a similar errand. — He 
 drew them from their deposit with less 
 reluctance than before. They were now 
 going to be devoted to gratitude and 
 benevolence ; an act which he knew his 
 parents, were they alive, would warmly 
 approve ; and here he allowed the end 
 to sanctify the means. 
 
 About half after six in the evening, he

 prepared himself for his task. Whether 
 it be congenial with melancholy to seek 
 the gloom, or whether the Count found 
 himself less observed under the shades 
 of night, is not evident ; but since his 
 exile, he preferred the dusk to any other 
 part of the day. 
 
 Before he went out, he asked Mrs, 
 Robson for Mr. Vincent's bill. Sinking 
 with obligation and shame, she put it in- 
 to his hand, and he left the house. When 
 he approached a lighted lamp, he opened 
 the paper to see the amount ; and find- 
 ing it was almost two pounds, he has- 
 tened forwards to the pawnbroker's. 
 
 The man was in the shop alone. Thad- 
 deus thought himself fortunate ; and, 
 after subduing a few qualms, entered 
 the door. The moment he laid his 
 sword and pistols on the counter, 
 and declared his wish, the man, even 
 through the disguise of a large coat and 
 slouched hat, recollected him. — This 
 honest money-lender carried sentiments

 in his breast above his occupation. He 
 did not commiserate all who presented 
 themselves before him, because many ex- 
 hibited, too evidently, the excesses which 
 brought them to his shop. — But there 
 was something in the figure and manner 
 of the Count Sobieski, whick struck him 
 at first sight ; and by continuing to pos- 
 sess his thoughts, excited such an inter- 
 est in his mind, as to produce pleasure 
 when he discerned the noble foreigner 
 in the person before him. 
 
 Mr. Burket (for so this money-lender 
 was called) asked him what he demanded 
 for the arms. 
 
 " Perhaps more than you would give. 
 But I have something else here," laying 
 down the diamonds 5 "I want eight 
 guineas." 
 
 Mr. Burket looked at them, and then 
 at their owner, hesitated, and then spoke. 
 
 " I beg your pardon. Sir ; I hope I 
 shall not offend you, but these things 
 appear to have a value independent of

 their price — they are inlaid with crests 
 and cyphers." 
 
 The blood flushed over the cheeks of 
 the Count. He had forgotten this cir- 
 cum stance ; — unable to answer, he 
 waited to hear what the man would say 
 further. 
 
 " I repeat, Sir, I mean not to offend, 
 but you appear a stranger to these trans- 
 actions. I only wish to suggest, that, in 
 case you should ever like to repossess 
 these things, had you not better pledge 
 them?" 
 
 " How ?'* asked Thaddeus, irresolutely, 
 and not knowing what to think of the 
 man's manner. 
 
 At that instant some other people 
 came into the shop ; and Mr. Burket, 
 gathering up the diamonds and the arms 
 in his hands, said, " If you do not object, 
 Sir, we will settle this business in my 
 back parlour ?" 
 
 The delicacy of this behaviour pene- 
 trated the mind of Thaddeus ; and, 
 16

 without demurring, he followed him into 
 a room. As Mr. Burket offered his guest 
 a chair, the Count took off his hat, and 
 laid it on the table. Burket contem- 
 plated the saddened dignity of his coun- 
 tenance, with renewed interest and re- 
 spect ; and, entreating him to be seated, 
 resumed the conversation. 
 
 " I see, Sir, you do not understand 
 the meaning of pledging, or pawning, 
 for it is one and the same thing ; but I 
 will explain it in two words. If you 
 leave these things with me, I will give 
 you a paper in acknowledgment, and 
 lend on them the guineas you request ; 
 which, when you return to me with a 
 stated interest, you shall have your de- 
 posit in exchange." 
 
 Sobieski received this offer with plea- 
 sure and thanks. He had entertained 
 no idea of any thing more being meant 
 by the trade of a pawnbroker, than a 
 man who bought what others wished to 
 sell.

 " Then, Sir," continued Burket, open- 
 ing an escrutoire, " I will give you 
 the money, and write the paper I spoke 
 of/* 
 
 As he put his hand to a drawer, he 
 heard voices in an adjoining passage; 
 and instantly shutting the desk, caught 
 up the things on the table, threw them 
 behind a curtain, and hastily taking the 
 Count by the hand, " My dear Sir," 
 cried he, *' do oblige me, and step into 
 that closet! you will find a chair. A 
 person is coming, whom I will dispatch 
 in a few seconds." 
 
 Thaddeus, rather surprised at such 
 hurry, did as he was desired j and the 
 door was closed on him just as the par- 
 lour door opened. Being aware from 
 such concealment that the visitor came 
 on secret business, he found his situation 
 not a little awkward. Seated behind a 
 curtained window, which the lights in 
 the room made transparent, he could not

 avoid seeing, as well as hearing, every 
 thing that passed. 
 
 " My dear Mr. Burket,'* cried an ele- 
 gant young creature, who ran into the 
 apartment, " positively without your as- 
 sistance I shall be undone." 
 
 " Any thing in my power. Madam,'* 
 returned Mr. Burket, with a distant, re- 
 spectful voice : " will Your Ladyship sit 
 down ?** 
 
 " Yes ; give me a chair : I am half 
 dead with distraction. Mr. Burket, I 
 must have another hundred upon those 
 jewels." 
 
 " Indeed, My Lady, it is not in my 
 power ; you have already had twelve 
 hundred ; and, upon my honour, that is a 
 hundred and fifty more than I ought to 
 have given." 
 
 <* Pugh, who minds the honour of a 
 pawnbroker !" cried the lady, laughing : 
 <* you know very well you live by cheat* 
 jng."

 33^ THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 
 
 " Well, Ma'am," returned he, with a 
 good-natured smile, " as Your Ladyship 
 pleases." 
 
 " Then I please that you let me have 
 another hundred. Why, man, you know 
 you lent Mrs. Hinchinbroke two thousand 
 upon a case of diamonds not a quarter so 
 many as mine." 
 
 " But consider. Madam, Mrs. Hinch- 
 inbroke's were of the best water." 
 
 ** Positively, Mr. Burnet," exclaimed 
 Her Ladyship, purposely miscalling his 
 name, " not better than mine ! The King 
 of Sardinia gave them to Sir Charles 
 when he knighted him. I know mine 
 are the best, and I must have another 
 hundred. Upon my soul, my servants have 
 not had a guinea of board wages these 
 four months, and they tell me they are 
 starving. Come, make haste, Mr. Bur- 
 net, you cannot expect me to stay here 
 all night ; give me the money." 
 
 *« Indeed, My Lady, I cannot." 
 
 " Heavens, what a brute of a man you

 are ! There," cried she, taking a string 
 of pearls from her neck and throwing it 
 on the table, ** lend me some of your 
 trumpery out of your shop, for I am go- 
 ing immediately from hence to take up 
 the Misses Dundas to the play ; and so 
 give me the hundred on that, and let me 
 go." 
 
 ** This is not worth a hundred.'* 
 " What a teasing man you are !'* cried 
 Her Ladyship angrily. " Well, let me 
 have the money now, and I will send 
 you the bracelets which belong to the 
 necklace to-morrow.'' 
 
 " Upon those conditions I will give 
 Your Ladyship another hundred." 
 
 " O, do ; you are the veriest miser I 
 ever met with. You are worse than 
 Shylock, or, — Good Lord ! what is 
 this," exclaimed she, interrupting her- 
 self, and taking up the draft he had laid 
 before her ; "and have you the conscience 
 to think, Mr. Pawnbroker, that I will 
 offer this at your banker's? that I will

 expose myself so far ? No, no ; take it 
 back, and give me gold. Come, dis- 
 patch ! else I cannot go to the play. 
 Look, there is my purse," added she^ 
 showing it, " make haste and fill it." 
 
 After satisfying her demands, Mn 
 Burket handed Her Ladyship out the 
 way she came in, which was by a private 
 passage ; and, having seated her in her 
 carriage, made his bow. 
 
 Meanwhile the Count Sobieski, wrap- 
 ped in astonishment at the profligacy 
 which the scene he had witnessed im- 
 plied, remained in concealment until the 
 pawnbroker returned and opened the 
 closet-door. 
 
 " Sir," said he, colouring, ** you have 
 undesignedly, on your part, been privy 
 to a very delicate affair ; but my credit, 
 Sir, and your honour " 
 
 " Shall both be sacred," replied the 
 Count, anxious to relieve the poor man 
 from his perplexity, and forbearing to 
 express surprise : — but Burket per-

 ceived it in his look ; and before he pro- 
 ceeded to fulfil his engagement with him, 
 stepped half way to the escrutoire, and 
 resumed. 
 
 " You appear amazed, Sir> at what you 
 have seen. And, if I am not mistaken, 
 you are from abroad?'* 
 
 ** Indeed I am amazed,'* replied So- 
 bieski ; " and I am from a country, where 
 the slightest suspicion of a transaction 
 such as this, would brand the woman 
 with infamy." 
 
 '' And so it ought," answered Burket : 
 " though by that assertion I speak against 
 my own interest; for it is by such as 
 Lady Villiers we make our money. Now, 
 Sir," continued he, drawing nearer to 
 the table, *' perhaps, after what you have 
 just beheld, you will not hesitate to credit 
 what I am going to tell you. I have now 
 in my hands, the jewels of one duchess, 
 of three countesses, and of women of 
 fashion without number. When these 
 ladies have an ill run at playi they apply

 to me ill their exigencies ; they bring 
 their diamonds here, and, as their occa- 
 sions require, on this deposit I lend them 
 money ; for which they make me a hand- 
 some present when the jewels are re- 
 leased." 
 
 ** Gracious Heaven 1'* exclaimed Thad- 
 deus, " what a degrading system of de- 
 ceit must govern the lives of these 
 women !" 
 
 " It is very lamentable," returned 
 Burket, " but so it is. And they con- 
 tinue to manage matters very cleverly. 
 By giving me their note or word of ho- 
 nour, (for if these ladies are not honour- 
 able with me, I know by what hints to 
 keep them in order,) I allow them to 
 have the jewels out for the birth-days, 
 and receive them again when their exhi- 
 bition is over. As a compensation for 
 these little indulgencies, I expect con- 
 siderable additions to the present at the 
 end." 
 
 Thaddeus could hardly believe such a

 liistory of those women, whom travellers 
 mentioned as not only the most lovely, 
 but the most amiable creatures in the 
 world. 
 
 *« Surely, Mr. Burkef cried he, "these 
 women must despise each other, and be- 
 come contemptible even to our sex.*' 
 
 ** O, no,'' rejoined the pawnbroker, 
 " they seldom trust each other in these 
 aflairs. All my fair customers are not so 
 silly as that pretty little lady who just 
 now left us. She and another woman of 
 quality, have made each other confidants 
 in this business. And Lord have mercy 
 upon me when they come together ! 
 They are as ravenous of my money as if 
 it had no other use but to supply them. 
 As to their husbands, brothers, and 
 fathers, they are usually the last people 
 who suspect or hear of these matters : 
 their applications, when they run out, 
 are made to Jews and professed usurers, 
 a race completely out of our line.'*

 " But are all English women of quality 
 of this disgraceful stamp ?" 
 
 " No, Heaven forbid !'* cried Burket : 
 ** if these female spendthrifts were not 
 held in awe by the dread of superior 
 characters, we could have no dependence 
 on their promises. O, no ; there are 
 ladies about the court, whose virtues are 
 as eminent as their rank : women, whose 
 actions might all be performed in mid- 
 day, before the world 5 and them, I never 
 see within my doors.' ' 
 
 " Well, Mr. Burket," rejoined Thad- 
 deus, smiling, " I am glad to hear that. 
 Yet I cannot forget the unexpected view 
 of the so famous British fair, which this 
 night has offered to my eyes. It is 
 strange \" 
 
 ** It is very bad, indeed, Sir," returned 
 the man, giving him the money and the 
 paper he had been preparing ; " but if 
 you should have occasion to call again 
 upon me, perhaps you may be astonished 
 still farther."

 The Count bowed ; and, thanking him 
 for his kindness, wished him a good 
 evening, and left the shop. 
 
 It was about seven o'clock when Thad- 
 deus arrived at the apothecary's. Mr. 
 Vincent was from home. To say the 
 truth, he had purposely gone out of the 
 way. For though he did not hesitate to 
 commit a shabby action, he wanted cou- 
 rage to face its consequence ; and to 
 avoid the probable remonstrances of Mrs. 
 Robson, he commissioned his assistant to 
 receive the amount of the bill. Without 
 making an observation, the Count paid 
 the man ; and was returning homeward 
 along Duke-Street and the Piazzas of 
 Drury-Lane Theatre, when the crowd 
 pressing round the doors constrained him 
 to stop. 
 
 After two or three ineffectual attempts 
 to get through the bustle, he retreated 
 a little behind the mob at the moment 
 when a chariot drew up, and a gentleman 
 stepping out with two ladies, darted with

 them into the house. One glance was 
 sufficient for Sobieski, who recognized 
 his friend Pembroke Somerset, in high 
 dress, gay, and laughing. The heart of 
 Thaddeus sprang to him at the sight ; 
 and forgetting his neglect, and his own 
 misfortunes, he ejaculated, 
 
 " Somerset !" 
 
 Trembling with eagerness and pleasure, 
 he pressed through the crowd, and en- 
 tered the'^ passage at the instant a green 
 door within shut upon his friend. 
 
 His disappointment was dreadful. To 
 be so near Somerset, and to lose him, 
 was more than he could sustain. His 
 bounding heart recoiled ; and the chill 
 of despair running through his veins, 
 turned him faint. Leaning against the 
 door, he took his hat off to give himself 
 air. He scarcely had stood a minute in 
 this situation revolving whether he 
 should follow his friend into the house, 
 or wait until he came out again, when a 
 gentleman begged him to make way for

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 341 
 
 a party of ladies that were entering. 
 Thaddeus moved on one side ; but the 
 opening of the green door casting a 
 strong light both on his face and the 
 group behind, his eyes and those of the 
 impertinent inquisitor of the Hummums 
 met each other. 
 
 Whether the man were conscious that 
 he deserved chastisement for his former 
 insolence, and dreaded to meet it now, 
 cannot be explained ; but he turned pale, 
 and shuffled by Thaddeus, as if he were 
 fearful to trust himself within reach of 
 his grasp. For the Count, he was too 
 deeply interested in his own pursuit, to 
 waste one surmise upon him. 
 
 He continued to muse on the sight of 
 Pembroke Somerset, which had conjured 
 up ten thousand fond and distressing re- 
 collections ; and with impatient anxiety, 
 determining to watch till the perform- 
 ance was over, he thought of enquiring 
 his friend's address of the servants ; but

 on looking round for that purpose, he 
 perceived the chariot had driven away. 
 
 Thus foiled, he returned to his post 
 near the green door ; which was opened 
 at intervals, by footmen, passing and re- 
 passing. Seeing the chamber within was 
 a lobby, in which it would be less likely 
 he should miss his object, than if he 
 stood without, he entered with the next 
 person that approached ; and finding 
 seats along the sides, sat down on the 
 one nearest to the stairs. 
 
 His first idea was to proceed into the 
 play-house. But he considered the little 
 chance of discovering any particular in- 
 dividual in so vast a building, as not 
 equal to the expense he must incur. 
 Besides, from the dress of the gentlemen 
 who entered the box-door, he was sensi- 
 ble his great coat and hat were not ad- 
 missible. 
 
 Having remained above an hour with 
 his eyes invariably fixed on the stairs, he 
 observed that same curious person who

 THADDEUS OF WARSAW. 343 
 
 had passed almost directly after his friend, 
 come down the steps and walk out of the 
 door. In two minutes he was returning 
 with a smirking countenance, when his 
 eyes accidentally falling on the Count, 
 (wlio sat with his arms folded, and almost 
 hidden by the shadow of the wall,) he 
 faltered in his walk ; and stretching out 
 his neck towards him, the gay grin left 
 his features -, and exclaiming in an 
 impatient voice, " Confound him !" he 
 hastened once more into the house. 
 
 This rencontre with his Hummums ac- 
 quaintance, affected Thaddeus as slightly 
 as the former; and, without annexing 
 even a thought to his figure as it flitted 
 by him, he remained watching in the 
 passage until half after eleven. At that 
 hour, the doors were thrown open, and 
 the company began to pour forth. 
 
 The Count's hopes were again on his 
 lips and in his eyes. With the first 
 party who came down the steps, he rose ; 
 and planting himself close to the bottom 
 stair drew his hat over his face, and

 narrowly examined each group as it 
 descended. Every set that approached, 
 made his heart palpitate : how often did 
 it rise and fall, during the long succes- 
 sion which continued moving for near 
 half an hour ! 
 
 By twelve, the house was cleared. He 
 saw the middle door locked ; and motion- 
 less with disappointment, did not attempt 
 to stir, until the man who held the keys 
 told him to go, as he was about to fasten 
 the other doors. 
 
 This roused Thaddeus ; and as he was 
 preparing to obey, he asked the man, if 
 there were any other passage from the 
 boxes. 
 
 " Yes," cried he, " there is one into 
 Drury-Lane." 
 
 " Then, by that I have lost him !" was 
 the reply which he made to himself. And 
 returning homewards, he arrived there a 
 few minutes after twelve.
