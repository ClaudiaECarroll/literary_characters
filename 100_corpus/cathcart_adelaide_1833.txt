 Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits." 
 
 Shakspea 
 
 It was in the autumn of 1817, that Mr. Shirley re- 
 turned home from a foreign tour. He had heen absent 
 nearly three years ; during that time he had travelled 
 through many countries, he had seen most of those 
 monuments of art which excite the curiosity and ad- 
 miration of the historian and antiquary ; and, he had 
 visited many of those scenes which recent and extra- 
 ordinary events had rendered peculiarly interesting. 
 
 The beginning of his tour was quite a party of plea- 
 sure. He set out with his father and his two sisters 
 for Paris, which was at that period the first object of 
 curiosity to English travellers. He was there joined 
 by a friend some years older than himself, who had 
 been his tutor at college, and who was now selected 
 by Sir Wilham Shirley, and chosen by himself, as 
 the companion of his travels.

 Six weeks passed away very agreeably in seeing 
 the curiosities of Paris. The Louvre, the Buildings, 
 the Public Places, furnished successive sources of in- 
 terest and amusement; and it was with regret that 
 Mr. Shirley took leave of the capital of France, to 
 proceed on his tour. He parted with his family, and 
 he and Mr. Montague went on towards Germany. 
 
 The travellers did not stay above a few days in any 
 place until they reached Vienna, where they made a 
 long pause. The next object of their interest was 
 Greece. They had been nearly a year in that coun- 
 try when Mr. Montague fell a victim to a low fever. 
 His death was more than a loss, — it was a serious 
 misfortune to Mr. Shirley, who was left to pursue his 
 travels without a guide and even without a compa- 
 nion. He could not bear to stay in Greece, where 
 every thing reminded him of his friend, so he em- 
 barked immediately for Italy, where he remained 
 more than a twelvemonth. 
 
 Unfortunately during his residence at Rome, he 
 formed an intimacy with several young Foreigners 
 and Englishmen who were very unworthy of his

 friendship, and who induced him to mix in the worst 
 society. Even the strength of his religious principles 
 was in some degree shaken, hy the false arguments, 
 the scepticism, and the ridicule of one of the most 
 dangerous and profligate of his companions. 
 
 The time that had been allotted for his tour, was 
 now nearly expired. Sir William Shirley had heard 
 rumours of his son's conduct and associates that gave 
 him great uneasiness, and increased his natural im- 
 patience to see him at home ; and Mr. Shirley him- 
 self began to think of returning to England. He 
 crossed the Alps, lingered a little while in Switzer- 
 land, and then proceeded towards his native country. 
 
 His return had been anxiously expected by his fa- 
 mily, and his arrival was an event that gave the most 
 heartfelt delight to his father and his sisters. 
 
 Sir William Shirley, was a baronet of large for- 
 tune, whose estates were situated in the north of Eng- 
 land. He was a man of considerable talent, a mem- 
 ber of parliament, and a warm partizan of the whig 
 interest. His domestic happiness had received a se- 
 vere blow from the death of his wife. His children

 were then so young, that they were sources of anxiety 
 rather than of comfort to him. He devoted, how- 
 ever, much of his attention to their education, and he 
 looked forward to their becoming in time his most 
 delightful companions. In the mean while, his home 
 was melancholy, and when the first poignancy of his 
 grief had abated,' he sought relief and consolation in 
 the society of his friends, and began, by degrees, to 
 mix again in the world. 
 
 Years [crept on, and his children grew up. His 
 son left college, and his daughters were of an age 
 to be taken out into the world. Emily, the eldest, 
 was extremely handsome, and considered herself pri- 
 vileged to assume the airs of a beauty. She was af- 
 fected and indolent, but her disposition was naturally 
 amiable. Julia, was in appearance, far less striking 
 than her sister, but though her features were not re- 
 gularly pretty, her countenance was animated and in- 
 telligent. She possessed a good deal of ready wit, 
 was much inclined to be satirical, and had no objec- 
 tion to amuse herself at the expense of her neigh- 
 bours. In short, she was that kind of person, who

 was reckoned very agreeable by all those who did not 
 discover that they had become, in their turn, the ob- 
 jects of her criticism. 
 
 Though Sir William shewed no outward partiality, 
 Emily was decidedly his favorite daughter, and he 
 was in a great measure blind to her foibles. The 
 more apparent imperfections of Julia's character fre- 
 quently distressed him, and he had endeavoured in 
 vain to correct them. 
 
 At the time of their brother's arrival in England, 
 Emily was just two and twenty, and Julia was one 
 year younger. 
 
 The morning after his return to Greyfield, Mr. 
 Shirley set out upon a long ramble with his father, 
 who took a pride and pleasure in shewing him the 
 improvements that had been made in the grounds dur- 
 ing his absence, and in pointing out the future altera- 
 tions he had planned. Sir William was afraid that 
 a long residence abroad might have weakened his 
 son's attachment to his native country, and he wished 
 to inspire him with an interest in the fine estate he 
 was one day to inherit.

 In the afternoon, the traveller was invited by his 
 sisters to walk with them to their flower-garden, which 
 was very pretty, and kept in excellent order. It had 
 been laid out by their mother, and, in their earlier 
 days, a part of it had been allotted to each of the 
 children, whose favorite amusement it was to culti- 
 vate these borders of their own. The young ladies 
 still retained a taste for gardening, and, as they pass- 
 ed from one blooming parterre to another, Julia, ex- 
 ultingly, asked her brother, c if he had ever seen finer 
 flowers in any of the countries he had visited ?' 
 
 The happy party sat down in an arbour, which Mr. 
 Shirley had himself assisted in constructing, and which 
 was now completely overgrown with creeping plants. 
 
 In his ramble with his father, William had expe- 
 rienced a proud sentiment of satisfaction and self-im- 
 portance. He had reflected with complacency upon 
 the idea that he was heir to such a property. But his 
 walk with his sisters awakened softer feelings, and 
 more tender recollections. He could not revisit the 
 scenes of all his youthful pleasures without interest 
 and emotion, and at that moment he experienced, most

 forcibly, the indescribable delight of being, (after a 
 long absence) returned to his native country, and sur- 
 rounded by his nearest and dearest relations. He 
 felt, that after all, there is no place in the world that 
 can be compared with Home. 
 
 The recollection of the life be had been leading in 
 Italy, stung him with shame and remorse — he sicken- 
 ed at the consciousness of the change that had taken 
 place in his own mind — he shuddered at his miser- 
 able irreligious doubts, and he turned with disgust 
 from the remembrance of his mis-spent time, and of 
 those companions, whose society and example, had 
 contributed to effect this unfortunate alteration in his 
 character. 
 
 While these sentiments were passing in his mind, 
 and while he was endeavouring to banish more recent 
 impressions, and to retrace, in imagination, days that 
 he acknowleged to himself had been the happiest of his 
 life, he could not fail to remember a little girl, who, 
 though rather younger than his sisters, had always been 
 invited by them to join in their parties of pleasure, and 
 who thus seemed associated with all his recollections :

 and he asked what was hecome of his pretty little 
 Adelaide ? " Your pretty little Adelaide/' answered 
 Julia, " is grown up into the beautiful and accom- 
 plished Miss Fauconberg. (I borrow the sublime 
 phraseology of the Morning Post.) You forget that 
 she is now seventeen." 
 
 " I was indeed thinking of her/' said William, " as 
 if she was still just the same as when I left her. She 
 was so lovely and engaging a child, that I can hardly 
 fancy any alteration has improved her." 
 
 u You will think differently when you have seen 
 her," rejoined Emily. 
 
 " I am not sure of that. Julia pronounces her 
 beautiful, but, I confess, I am rather fastidious about 
 beauty.'' 
 
 " Oh," exclaimed Julia, " I am certain you will ad- 
 mire her. And" — looking archly at her sister, " you 
 need not be afraid of her giving herself airs, or ex- 
 pecting you to be captivated with her charms ; for 
 she does not seem to know, at least to recollect, that 
 she is handsome."

 she continues free from that failing", I must forgive 
 her for being a Beauty. But to proceed to her ac- 
 complishments : — is she a fine musician, does she draw 
 like an artist, is she a graceful dancer?'' 
 
 u You are really too conceited," replied Julia, t6 and 
 may therefore undervalue Adelaide's accomplishments, 
 particularly as she makes no display of them. — In an- 
 swer to your interrogations, I shall only say, that she 
 plays and sings well, she draws prettily, and she is a 
 good dancer. What is still more extraordinary, is, 
 that she does not pride herself the least upon any of 
 these acquirements, and she never desires to shew them 
 
 off." 
 
 M No," continued Emily, u she values herself much 
 
 more upon her mental attainments." 
 
 " I hope she does not affect to be blue" said Mr. 
 Shirley, a there is no person so insufferably disgusting, 
 as a pedantic young lady, who has gained a little smat- 
 tering of every thing, and who really knows nothing ; 
 who attends lectures, and uses scientific phrases. If 
 Miss Fauconberg is one of these Precieuses Ridicules, 
 I shall not wish to renew my acquaintance with her." 
 
 " Truly, William, you might have spared your

 tirade againt pedantry," observed Emily, li for, I can 
 assure you, Adelaide is not the least pedantic. You 
 may discover from her conversation, that she is sensi- 
 ble and well informed ; but I should say, that she ra- 
 ther endeavours to conceal, than to bring forward all 
 she knows." 
 
 " If she answers your description of her, she must 
 be a very charming" person; but, tell me, Julia, has 
 she no little imperfections to counterbalance all these 
 natural and acquired excellencies ?" 
 
 " She is certainly not exempt from mortal failings, 
 but, to do her justice, she has fewer faults than most 
 people — she is almost too good. I sometimes feel afraid 
 of her, I know not why. Her ideas are too old for her 
 age ; she is apt to look rather grave and formal, and, 
 worst of all, she never laughs at any of the clever things 
 J say! But, it is growing late, — let us return to the 
 house, where my father must, by this time, be expect- 
 ing us. We shall find plenty other opportunities of 
 talking of Adelaide, and en attendant, I want to hear 
 more about your travels." 
 
 The trio rose to leave the arbour, and other subjects 
 of conversation occupied them during the evening.

 Mr. Shirley's interest had been awakened, and his 
 curiosity excited, by the account his sisters had given 
 of his former little favorite, Adelaide Fauconberg, 
 and he determined to ride over to her father's, and con- 
 vince himself if she was really as amiable as they had 
 represented her to be. 
 
 Sir George Fauconberg, was one of Sir William 
 Shirley's nearest neighbours. He possessed a large 
 fortune, resided the greatest part of the year upon his 
 own estate, and was anxious to promote the welfare 
 and happiness of his tenants and dependants. He was 
 a tory by education, but he did not interest himself 
 much in party politics. He found constant occupation 
 out of doors, in superintending the management of

 his farm. He delighted also in field sports ; and, on a 
 rainy day, he could always have recourse to his hooks, 
 for his mind was cultivated as well as benevolent. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was a vain-glorious, artful, nar- 
 row-minded woman, who valued herself upon her 
 knowledge of the world, and her own superior talents. 
 Her good opinion of herself, led her to under-rate the 
 abilities of her husband, to profess her admiration 
 of a line of politics opposed to his ; and so much did 
 she pique herself upon her finesse and delicate ma- 
 nagement, (anglice spirit of intrigue,) that she inter- 
 nally despised his open hearted sincerity, and honest 
 plain dealing. 
 
 Adelaide was the only child of this ill- matched pair. 
 Her father had anxiously attended to the cultivation 
 of her mind, while her mother had no less carefully 
 watched over the progress of her accomplishments. 
 These Adelaide considered as intended to please others, 
 rather than to amuse herself, and her great delight con- 
 sisted in reading and more improving studies. She 
 was free from affectation, — still more from pedan- 
 try ; but, from having lived constantly with people

 much older than herself, her manners were a little se- 
 date, and she sometimes appeared too pose for her 
 age. Her affections were strong, she possessed ex- 
 cellent sense, and her disposition was peculiarly cheer- 
 ful. Bred up in luxury and comfort, she had always 
 been encouraged to feel for the distresses of the poor, 
 and to visit and relieve them herself. This practice 
 afforded her one of her greatest pleasures ; but her 
 charities were carefully concealed from the world. 
 
 As, in addition to her prepossessing appearance and 
 amiable qualities, Adelaide was heiress to a large for- 
 tune, she did not fail to meet with many admirers ; but, 
 even during her infancy, her provident mother had 
 formed a scheme for her establishment, and had fixed 
 upon the son of Sir William Shirley, as the future 
 husband of her daughter. This union appeared like- 
 ly, in many respects, to be advantageous to both fa- 
 milies, and it required nothing but the mutual consent 
 and attachment of the parties themselves, to make it 
 completely desirable. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg had looked anxiously forward to 
 Mr. Shirley's return from abroad. Circumstances,

 too, had lately occurred, which made her desire this 
 event with almost feverish impatience. She dreaded 
 the possibility of his forming some attachment that 
 might ruin her projects, and she felt assured, that if 
 his affections were disengaged when he saw her daugh- 
 ter, he would inevitably fall in love with her. She, 
 therefore, experienced the most unfeigned satisfac- 
 tion, when she heard that he was actually arrived at 
 Greyfield. 
 
 Mr. Shirley, who feared Julia's raillery, was half 
 ashamed to say that he was going to ride over to 
 Fauconberg Manor, till his sister opened the subject 
 herself, by telling him that Emily had received a note 
 from Lady Fauconberg. 
 
 " And what says her ladyship ?" replied he, " is she 
 as high and mighty and hypocritical as ever ; or has 
 she too undergone a metamorphosis during my ab- 
 sence, and become condescending, gentle, and sin- 
 
 cere f 
 
 ?»> 
 
 " I believe you will find her no changeling," an- 
 swered Julia, " and yet her note is most condescend- 
 ing, amiable, and affectionate. She writes to con-

 gratulaie us upon your return, which, she assures us, 
 is an event that also gives very great pleasure to her- 
 self, — and in so saying, I allow her the merit of be- 
 ing perfectly sincere." 
 
 " In return for all this attention and kindness, the 
 least I can do, is to fly over upon the wings of gra- 
 titude, and pay her a visit." 
 
 i( You can devise nothing that will please her better, 
 and I will ensure you a cordial reception — so adieu- 
 give my love to Adelaide.'' 
 
 And so saying, Julia ran out of the room. 
 
 Mr. Shirley found Lady Fauconberg alone, and, as 
 Julia had predicted, she received him with marked 
 cordiality and kindness. She was a very agreeable 
 woman when she thought it worth her while to be so, 
 and even those who disliked her, and were aware of 
 her duplicity, — owned that her manner towards per- 
 sons whom she wished to prepossess in her favour, 
 was extremely fascinating. Mr. Shirley had a large 
 share of vanity, and though he disliked and despised 
 Lady Fauconberg, and was well aware of her motive 
 in flattering him, he felt secretly gratified by her

 16 ADELAIDE. 
 
 professions of interest, and by the indirect praise 
 which she artfully introduced in her conversation; and 
 he was beginning to repay her admiration in kind, 
 when Adelaide entered the room. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg was not strikingly beautiful, but 
 her countenance was extremely interesting, and there 
 was something peculiarly amiable in the expression of 
 her features. She had large blue eyes, a profusion of 
 auburn hair, and an uncommonly fine complexion. 
 On seeing Mr. Shirley, her natural bloom was height- 
 ened by a blush of surprise, and he certainly did not 
 at that moment regret the change that had taken place 
 in her appearance. 
 
 66 Adelaide," said Lady Fauconberg, " I have a 
 delightful surprise for you. Your old friend Wil- 
 liam, Mr. Shirley , I ought now to call him, is come 
 over to see us." Then turning to her guest, u she is 
 uncommonly grown, is she not ?" continued her lady- 
 ship, casting towards her daughter a glance of maternal 
 pride, and observing, at the same time, the impression 
 Adelaide's beauty had made upon Mr. Shirley. 
 
 He was, indeed, much charmed with the appear-

 ance of his former favorite, and the compliment he 
 addressed to Lady Fauconberg upon her improvement, 
 was far more sincere than such compliments usually 
 are. 
 
 Adelaide's manner, though perfectly free from af- 
 fectation, was not quite unembarrassed. She receiv- 
 ed Mr. Shirley as an old friend, and seemed pleased 
 to see him, but he thought there was a degree of re- 
 serve and diffidence about her, which he had not ex- 
 actly expected. He prolonged his visit as much as 
 possible, under a pretence of anxiety to see Sir George 
 Fauconberg, and returned home more fascinated with 
 Adelaide than he choose to confess to his sisters, or 
 perhaps even to himself.

 On his first return, Mr. Shirley seemed pleased to 
 find himself again with his family, and to be extreme- 
 ly happy at home ; but there was a restlessness in his 
 disposition, which soon made him tire of the uniformi- 
 ty of a country life. His father perceived, with pain, 
 that he was not likely to be satisfied for any length of 
 time, in his own domestic circle. He had anxiously 
 and attentively studied his character, and had dis- 
 covered imperfections in his temper, and unamiable 
 points in his conduct, which gave him considerable 
 uneasiness. These, however, might not have been

 ADELAIDE. 19 
 
 remarked by a more superficial, or a less interested 
 observer ; for, to the world in general, he appeared a 
 young* man of much promise. He was naturally has- 
 ty an 1 violent, but he had acquired so much control 
 over his passions, that, unless he was thrown off his 
 guard by any very extraordinary excitement, he was 
 never betrayed into outward demonstrations of ill-tem- 
 per. He possessed that sort of dissimulation, which 
 enabled him in a great measure to conceal his feel- 
 ings ; and his vanity led him to wish that every body 
 should think more highly of him than he deserved. 
 His pride was excessive, and he considered any oppo- 
 sition to his will, as an obstacle which it was a sort of 
 duty to overcome. This feeling was so strong, that 
 it even influenced his manner, which was haughty to 
 his equals, and overbearing towards his inferiors. 
 
 Yet, with a strange sort of contradiction, which is 
 frequently seen in the same character, he liked the 
 society of low people, or, in other words, he had no 
 objection to finding himself the head of his company. 
 
 His talents were by no means of a superior order ; 
 and during his abode abroad, he had acquired more 
 
 b2

 20 ADELAIDE. 
 
 superficial knowledge than real information. He had 
 great conversational powers, and could render himself 
 so entertaining in society, that other people were 
 often inclined to agree with him in his good opinion 
 of his own abilities, taste, and judgment. To a happy 
 degree of quickness, that enabled him to catch at 
 once the outline of any subject, he added a tact that 
 prevented his trusting himself beyond his depth, in 
 whatever discussion he might be engaged ; and to this 
 enviable discretion, he perhaps owed more of the ad- 
 miration that was entertained for his acquirements, 
 than he would have been at all willing to allow. Cer- 
 tain it is, that he was expected by his friends to make a 
 brilliant figure in the world, and it was thought, that 
 his father would endeavour to bring him into parlia- 
 ment, where his abilities might find a fair field to dis- 
 play themelves to public admiration. 
 
 But Sir William's own more accurate discernment, 
 had taught him to fear that his son, with all his daz- 
 zling command of language, was very ill fitted to 
 shine in the House of Commons. He was painfully 
 aware, that during his sejour upon the continent, he had

 ADELAIDE. 21 
 
 acquired wild ideas of freedom and independence, 
 which might lead him to express extravagant opinions, 
 and to advocate dangerous and seditious measures. 
 He, therefore, checked rather than encouraged his 
 evident inclination to enter warmly into politics. 
 
 Mr. Shirley's growing passion for Miss Fauconberg, 
 was a circumstance that gave much satisfaction to his 
 father, who had a high opinion of Adelaide's good 
 sense, and a perfect conviction of the amiability of 
 her disposition. He hoped, that if she were united 
 to his son, she might obtam sufficient influence over 
 him, to soften and smooth away the defects of his 
 character, and to attach him to his home and his coun- 
 try. Without appearing, therefore, to notice Wil- 
 liam's preference, he took every opportunity of prais- 
 ing its object when she was absent, and of drawing 
 forth her talents when she was present. The two fa- 
 milies met often, and the more Mr. Shirley saw of 
 Adelaide, the more he became charmed with her. 
 Lady Fauconberg was proud and happy to see the 
 success that seemed likely to crown her favorite 
 scheme, and secretly applauded her own excellent

 management. She had private reasons, too, for wish- 
 ing to lead on her protege to declare his sentiments 
 as speedily as possible. 
 
 If Sir George was not equally elated with Mr. 
 Shirley's evident admiration of his daughter, it was 
 a circumstance he could assign no good reason to him- 
 self for regretting. Still, there was something about 
 Mr. Shirley, (he could not precisely define what it was,) 
 that did not quite please him. Perhaps he found him 
 deficient in that open-hearted sincerity, which was 
 most congenial to his own character — perhaps at times 
 he fancied him presuming and self-sufficient — per- 
 haps, after all, it was a prejudice — the very contradic- 
 tion of human nature — that prepossessed him against 
 him, because his cause had been so warmly advo- 
 cated by Lady Fauconberg, long before he had ever 
 appeared likely to plead it himself. 
 
 These doubts passed frequently through Sir George's 
 mind ; and, on the other hand, he considered that the 
 person they affected, was a young man who stood high 
 in the good opinion of the world, whose abilities and 
 acquirements were the theme of universal praise — who

 ADELAIDE. 23 
 
 was the son of one of his oldest friends, and nearest 
 neighbours, and who, with all these advantages, was 
 in every point of view, a very desirable Partie for his 
 daughter. 
 
 He had heard rumours of William's conduct during" 
 his absence, that were highly prejudicial to his cha- 
 racter, but the fact of his having returned to Grey- 
 field, and become quietly and happily domesticated 
 there, formed the best refutation of these. At all 
 events, the worthy Baronet was too liberal minded, to 
 judge very harshly of a young man of Mr. Shirley's 
 age, for having been led into temporary errors, which 
 might prove a salutary warning to him through after- 
 life. 
 
 Far from entering into Lady Fauconberg's desire 
 to precipitate matters, Sir George was in no hurry to 
 form a decision. He wished to see more of Mr. Shir- 
 ley, to know him batter, before he could trust him 
 with the future guardianship of Adelaide's happiness. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg, herself, received the attentions 
 of Mr. Shirley with an indifference that almost 
 amounted to coldness. Her manner was perfectly

 24 ADELAIDE. 
 
 civil, but she seemed to shun rather than to invite 
 any approach to greater intimacy, or more unreserved 
 communication with a person, in whose eyes she 
 evidently took no pains to appear particularly capti- 
 vating. 
 
 Was Adelaide's heart composed of such frigid ma- 
 terials, that it was impossible to inspire it with feel- 
 ings of tenderness ? or had some previous attachment 
 rendered it insensible to any secondary impression ? 
 
 These were questions that Mr. Shirley often asked 
 himself. The first, was answered at once, by the 
 slightest acquaintance with Miss Fauconberg's ami- 
 able and affectionate character. The second, was 
 a point less easily decided. Yet Adelaide was only 
 seventeen, he had never heard of her having had any 
 other admirer, nor had he seen or known of any per- 
 son staying at Fauconberg Manor, whom he could 
 consider as bearing the slightest semblance of a Rival. 
 He well knew that if he had a Rival, his sisters must 
 be aware of the circumstance, yet his pride would not 
 allow him to make any direct enquiries upon the sub- 
 ject. When he endeavoured to obtain from them, in

 ADELAIDE. 25 
 
 a round about way, the information he desired, Emily, 
 either did not understand, or affected not to under- 
 stand what he meant, and he felt half inclined to be 
 angry with her, for her evident determination to keep 
 him in the dark. 
 
 Julia perfectly comprehended what was passing in 
 her brother's mind, and often assured him with a 
 serio-comic expression of countenance, " that to the 
 best of her knowledge, Adelaide, commonly called 
 Miss Fauconberg, did not at that moment possess any 
 other Lover than himself; and it was, moreover, her 
 solemn belief, that she never had had any other seri- 
 ous Admirer, or, in other words, any Admirer who 
 had ever seriously thought of marrying her." 
 
 Julia frequently amused herself with teasing him 
 about his devotion to his u Lady Love" and warning 
 him to beware of growing jealous of his own shadow. 
 And she earnestly exhorted him, if ever he was anx-

 by invitation to dine and sleep at Fauconberg Manor. 
 His Father and Sisters had been asked also, but were 
 previously engaged by expected Guests at home. Wil- 
 liam, who always considered himself independent of 
 his family, told Emily and Julia they must make his 
 excuses to their good friends, whom, he had no doubt, 
 they would be very well able to entertain in his ab- 
 sence; for, he was sure, poor Lady Fauconberg would 
 break her heart, if he did not obey her summons. 
 " And would Adelaide break her's too?" said Julia. 
 The question stung Mr. Shirley ; he darted an angry 
 look towards his sister, and left the room. 
 
 " How can you like to vex William in that way ?" 
 observed Emily reproachfully. 
 
 " I am sorry I have vexed him, but I have no pa- 
 tience with the sort of diplomatic reserve he maintains 
 towards us. He well knows how deeply interested 
 we feel in his success ; why can he not, therefore, 
 when he is going to Fauconberg Manor, say at once, 
 6 I am going to see Adelaide,' — instead of beginning 
 a set speech, and talking all that nonsense about Lady 
 Fauconbero- ?"

 " All this is very true," continued Emily, laugh- 
 ing, a but remember, Julia, we must make some al- 
 lowance for a person who is in love." And, so say- 
 ing-, she took up a book which she had been studying 
 attentively before her brother came into the room. 
 
 It was the first week in April, and most of the fa- 
 milies in the neighbourhood of Greyfield, were mov- 
 ing towards London. Sir William Shirley had been 
 detained in the country by business much later than 
 usual. Sir George and Lady Fauconberg never went 
 to town very early, but they were now all to depart 
 in about a fortnight. Mr. Shirley much wished to 
 plead his suit with Adelaide, before she became en- 
 gaged in another round of London gaieties. Hitherto, 
 her coldness had always checked him, when he had 
 attempted to give any thing like an unusual interest 
 to his conversation ; but he was at length determined 
 to make one bold effort to ascertain the real state of 
 her sentiments. 
 
 The day was remarkably fine, and, as he rode to- 
 wards Fauconberg Manor, he contrived to skirt the 
 pleasure ground, in hopes of finding Adelaide in her

 garden ; but she was not visible there — and when he 
 arrived at the house, Lady Fauconberg was alone in 
 the library waiting to receive her company. 
 
 Her greeting was even more than commonly kind 
 and flattering, but he thought she looked fussed. He 
 enquired after Miss Fauconberg, and was told she was 
 out riding with her father. 
 
 '' I wonder they are not returned !" continued her 
 ladyship, " Sir George promised me he would not 
 keep her out long, she will be sadly tired ; and I want 
 her to help me to entertain the young Ladies who are 
 coming here. It will be very uncivil if she is not at 
 home to welcome the Miss Coopers." All this was 
 spoken in a sort of soliloquy. Addressing her guest 
 more directly, she said, u we expect Mr. and Mrs. 
 Cooper, and their two Daughters, to stop here for one 
 day, in their way to town." Lady Fauconberg then 
 enumerated several other people who were to com- 
 pose the party, and who w r ere all well known to Mr. 
 Shirley. 
 
 He enquired if the Miss Coopers were pretty ? he 
 had remembered them as children.

 " Yes, indeed," replied Lady Fauconberg, " they 
 are very nice looking girls, and there is a great air of 
 fashion about them ; but they are terribly silly and 
 insipid. They can talk about balls and dress, and, I 
 dare say, about flirtations, but they do not seem to me 
 to have one other idea in the world." 
 
 " It is not extraordinary," observed Mr. Shirley, 
 with a smile, M that Miss Fauconberg should not be 
 impatient to return to such companions." 
 
 Here the conversation was interrupted by the en- 
 trance of a servant who brought a note to Lady Fau- 
 conberg. It contained an excuse from one of her ex- 
 pected visitors. She commented upon it, expressed 
 her regret, and then changed the subject, by asking, 
 if Mr. Shirley happened to know Colonel Algernon ? 
 " Which Algernon ?" said he, "Horace or Henry?" 
 u Henry is, I believe, the name of the person I mean, 
 but I really know very little about him." 
 
 61 No," replied Mr. Shirley, " I am not at all ac- 
 quainted with Henry ; I met Horace at Rome. — But 
 why did you ask me about Colonel Algernon? has 
 any thing particular happened to him, is he, par ex- 
 em pie, going to be married ?"

 Lady Fauconberg's face grew crimson, and she 
 hastily exclaimed, u Oh dear, no, I should think that 
 very unlikely." Then, in a calmer tone of voice, she 
 continued, " I was merely going" to observe, that you 
 would meet him here to-day." 
 
 Mr. Shirley started I (i Is Henry Algernon com- 
 ing here, to-day?" 
 
 " Yes," replied Lady Fauconberg, with affected 
 indifference : a It seems he came down into this neigh- 
 bourhood last week, with Colonel Harcourt. We used 
 to see him sometimes in London, so he rode over here 
 yesterday, and Sir George invited him to return, and 
 dine here to-day. Entre nous he is not quite a sort 
 of person I wish to see a great deal of ; Sir George 
 thinks him very agreeable, and so will You I dare 
 say; — Gentlemen's tastes are a]ways so different in 
 these matters from ladies'." 
 
 " I have no doubt he is entertaining enough," an- 
 swered Mr. Shirley. " Horace can be the most 
 amusing companion in the world ; but then, he is such 
 a wild unprincipled fellow, that one is almost ashamed 
 of being seen much in his society. He and his Cou- 
 sin were brought up together ; they were put into the

 same regiment of Guards; they served together, and 
 are, therefore, probably much alike in many respects.'' 
 
 All further discussion was cut short by the arrival 
 of the Cooper Family. Other people dropped in by 
 degrees, and nearly the whole party was assembled, 
 before Sir George and Adelaide came in from their 
 ride. When they did at length make their appearance, 
 they were accompanied by a tall handsome young 
 man, whose strong family likeness to his cousin, at 
 once enabled Mr. Shirley to recognise as Colonel 
 Algernon. 
 
 After the first greetings and introductions were over, 
 Sir George apologized to Mr. Cooper for not having 
 been at home to receive him when he arrived. u I 
 intended to have come in early," said he, "but just as 
 Adelaide and I were turning our horses' heads home- 
 wards, we were overtaken by Colonel Algernon, who 
 is a stranger in those parts ; and, as I am sorry to say, 
 he leaves us to-morrow, I could not lose the opportu- 
 nity of showing him some points of the country. 
 We made a little circuit, and were astonished to find 
 how late it was when we got back here."

 Not a word of this explanation was lost upon Mr. 
 Shirley, though he was engaged in conversation with 
 the young Ladies. He drew a chair heside Adelaide's, 
 and, late as it was, Lady Fauconberg seemed in no 
 hurry to propose going up stairs to dress. 
 
 She smiled almost graciously upon Colonel Alger- 
 non, who was admiring the natural beauty of Sir 
 George's grounds, and the singular neatness of his 
 roads and hedges. 
 
 If the Colonel continued talking to his Hostess, it 
 was evident that he was attentively observing what 
 was passing opposite to him. His eyes were directed 
 towards Adelaide, and he and Mr. Shirley very much 
 resembled two angry mastiffs, watching one another 
 from a distance, as if mutually unwilling to begin the 
 fight, yet anxious to find some excuse for flying at each 
 other's throat.

 SH AKSPE ARE, 
 
 Horace and Henry Algernon, were the grandsons 
 of Lord Altamont — they had both been left orphans 
 at a very early age, and had been brought up toge- 
 ther by him. Henry's father, who was the younger 
 brother, had been in the army, and had unfortunately 
 disobliged Lord Altamont, by making an imprudent 
 marriage. The haughty Peer, consented indeed, to 
 see him afterwards, but he never cordially forgave 
 him. Captain Algernon went abroad with his regi- 
 ment, and fell gloriously in an action with the enemy. 
 
 His unhappy Widow did not long survive him. Even 
 during his life time, the divisions she had caused in 
 the family she had married into, had preyed much 
 upon her mind ; her constitution was naturally deli-

 cate, and she never entirely recovered the shock of 
 her husband's death. Her greatest anxiety at the 
 prospect of leaving the world, was occasioned by the 
 consciousness of the forlorn and friendless situation of 
 her infant son ; but this had been, in a great measure, 
 relieved by a communication from Lord Altamont. 
 His heart had become softened towards her since their 
 mutual affliction, and he wrote her a very kind let- 
 ter, expressing his concern at her declining health, 
 and his good wishes for her recovery. At the same 
 time, giving her a solemn assurance, that if his grand- 
 son should ever be so unfortunate as to need a protec- 
 tor, he would consider him as his own child, and bring 
 him up under his own roof. This promise, Lord Al- 
 tamont faithfully performed. Upon his daughter-in- 
 law's death, he took home little Henry, and spared 
 no pains or attention in promoting his education. He 
 was a particularly engaging, intelligent child. Yet 
 Lord Altamont's friends remarked, that his grandfa- 
 ther always seemed to consider him rather as an ob- 
 ject of compassion and solicitude, than of affection 
 and delight.

 ADELAIDE. 35 
 
 Lord Altamont's former harsh and unforgiving con- 
 duct towards his younger son, seemed destined to 
 draw down upon him a yet more afflicting punish- 
 ment. His eldest son and favorite child, had mar- 
 ried with his entire approbation, and was settled near 
 him. He had also a son, a few months older than lit- 
 tle Henry, and the birth of this heir, appeared to 
 gratify every wish of his heart. 
 
 But the old Lord's happiness was not of long dura- 
 tion. Horace was scarcely six years old, when Mr. 
 Algernon was suddenly earned off by a fever. This 
 blow was nearly too much for poor Lord Altamont ; 
 his spirit was entirely broken, and he seemed to 
 find consolation in nothing but caressing his darling 
 Horace. He could not bear the child to be out of 
 his sight, he declared he could never part with him, 
 and he persuaded his daughter-in-law to take up her 
 abode in his house. 
 
 Henry was still treated with great kindness, but, 
 young as he was, he could not fail to discover his 
 grandfather's partiality for his cousin. As he grew 
 up, he felt this to be the more mortifying", but he

 was too generous to be capable of jealous}', and too 
 spirited to allow himself to be imposed upon by the 
 favorite. He had the admirable art of teaching Horace 
 at once to respect and to love him. 
 
 To Horace, the early loss of a father, was a calami- 
 ty that fatally influenced his future character. His 
 mother, with mistaken kindness, spoilt him to a de- 
 gree that was deplorable. Lord Altamont carried his 
 ill-judged indulgence towards him, if possible, still 
 further- — he was quite blind to his faults, and never 
 allowed him to be contradicted in any thing. 
 
 Mrs. Algernon had a horror of sending her son to 
 school, but even Lord Altamont began to perceive, 
 that Horace was growing rather ungovernable, and he 
 insisted upon placing both his grandsons at Eton. 
 To Henry, it was a great happiness, to feel himself 
 in a situation where he could make his own way 
 among his companions. And, to Horace, the mortifi- 
 cation he experienced at first, at finding himself one 
 among a crowd, and no peculiar object of interest to 
 any body, was more than compensated by the advan- 
 tage he gained in discovering his own proper level, 
 and being obliged to exert the talents he possessed.

 ADELAIDE. 37 
 
 The characters of the cousins when they left school, 
 were widely different. Both were highly gifted by 
 nature, but Horace was a fiery, hot-headed youth, 
 whose ungoverned passions would submit to no con- 
 trol, and whose haughty temper scorned to conciliate 
 affection. While Henry, though high spirited and 
 ardent, was amiable and well disposed, and had the 
 happy secret of rendering himself beloved by all who 
 knew him. 
 
 Lord Altamont's views for his grandsons, were as 
 dissimilar as their prospects in life. For Horace, whom 
 he looked upon as the future representative of his fa- 
 mily, the heir to a peerage, and a large landed pro- 
 perty, — he thought it would be unnecessary to enter 
 into any profession, and he hoped to persuade him 
 still to consider his house as his home. 
 
 Henry had very early expressed a desire to follow 
 his father's footsteps in the army. This was not the 
 line Lord Altamont would have selected for him, 
 but, as he was to make his own way in the world, he 
 yielded to his wishes, and purchased him a commis- 
 sion in the guards.

 Horace had no sooner seen his cousin equipped in 
 his uniform, than he was struck with the idea, how 
 becoming such a dress would be to himself, and he re- 
 quested his grandfather to allow him also to go into the 
 army. The poor old Peer was thunderstruck at such 
 a proposal, but he was doomed to feel the bitter con- 
 sequence of his own system of indulgence. Horace 
 declared, in no very respectful terms, his firm resolu- 
 tion of becoming a soldier, and, in spite of the tears of 
 his mother, and the earnest and pathetic entreaties of 
 Lord Altamont, he carried his point. He was placed 
 in the same regiment with Henry, and they were al- 
 most immediately sent out to join Lord Wellington's 
 army in Spain. 
 
 During the Peninsular war, the two cousins behav- 
 ed with distinguished gallantry ; they had the good 
 fortune of attracting more than once the observation 
 of their great Commander, and of being noticed with 
 approbation. Lord Altamont was deeply gratified 
 by the honorable testimony that was borne by every 
 one, to the military glory of his grandsons ; he was 
 proud of the Laurels they had won : and the distinction

 which his beloved Horace had acquired, almost con- 
 soled him for the loss of his society. 
 
 a Horace was quite right," he often observed, " to 
 go into the army ; he felt that he had talents to shine 
 in the field, and, had he staid at home with his mother 
 and me, as we were foolish enough to wish him to do, 
 his superiority would have been useless to himself, 
 and unknown to the world. As it is, the merit of 
 having distinguished himself, is all his own." 
 
 The battle of Waterloo concluded the active mili- 
 tary career of the two Algernons. Henry was slight- 
 ly wounded there, and both remained for some time in 
 France with the Army of Occupation, during which 
 period, it may be imagined that they contrived to ob- 
 tain leave of absence to visit Paris. Horace always 
 liked high play, and there his taste for gambling was 
 fatally indulged. He lost large sums of money, and 
 got into embarrassments which he dared not fully con- 
 fess even to his indulgent Grandfather. He returned 
 in despair to his quarters, and growing tired of the 
 monotony of his life there, he quitted the Army in 
 disgust, and went upon half pay.

## p. 40 (#62) ##############################################


 
 40 ADELAIDE. 
 
 This step at first surprised and mortified Lord Al- 
 tamont. Horace persuaded him that he had good rea- 
 sons for what he had done. The old Peer was how- 
 ever grieved to find, that instead of coming home to 
 remain with him after his long absence, his Grandson 
 had decided to make a tour in Italy ; and he actually 
 set out for that country very shortly after he returned 
 from France. 
 
 Henry, who really liked the Army as a Profession, 
 was very well contented to remain with his Regiment 
 abroad, till a step of promotion brought him back to 
 England the winter before our narrative commences. 
 
 From their near relationship, and still more from 
 the very peculiar circumstances of their situation, it 
 was natural that Horace and Henry Algernon should 
 always have regarded each other as brothers. At school 
 they certainly did so, and, after their return from Spain, 
 no casual observer would have remarked any outward 
 diminution of their friendship and affection ; but to 
 those who knew them most intimately after that time, 
 it might have been perceptible that something had 
 occurred, — perhaps at no recent period ; which had

 ADELAIDE. 41 
 
 interrupted the feeling of perfect confidence and cor- 
 diality which had once existed between them. They 
 were no longer inseparable companions. — On the con- 
 trary, the absence of the one, seemed to afford a sort 
 of relief to the other, and they evidently felt happier 
 when they were apart. 
 
 Henry Algernon's life in London, was a very plea- 
 sant one ; his birth and situation in the world, entitled 
 him to gain admittance at once to the highest society, 
 and his talents and accomplishments rendered him the 
 ornament of every circle. Handsome and agreable, 
 as he was universally allowed to be, he possessed a de- 
 gree of popularity that few people can hope to at- 
 tain. Courted by the crowd, and admired by. those 
 whose approbation bestowed the stamp of fashion, no 
 party was reckoned perfectly agreable without Colonel 
 Algernon. Henry was far from being insensible to 
 the gratifying and advantageous position in which he 
 found himself placed, yet the tide of favour that 
 flowed so strongly towards him, had no power to turn 
 his head, and he continued as unassuming and as free 
 from affectation as he had ever been.

 Before we return to the party we left assembled ed 
 Fauconberg Manor, it will be as well to trace the be- 
 ginning' and progress of Colonel Henry Algernon's 
 acquaintance with the Fauconberg Family. He first 
 met them at a great dinner in London, early in the 
 spring after his return from abroad, and was much 
 struck with Adelaide's beauty, and with the unaffected 
 modesty of her manner : He sat next to her at din- 
 ner, and was still more charmed with the artless gaiety 
 of her conversation, and the unpretending good sense 
 of her remarks. In short, her natural and amiable 
 character, appeared to him the more delightful, from 
 the strong contrast it formed to those of most of the 
 young Ladies he had lately seen at Paris, and in Lon- 
 don, whose greatest merit seemed to consist in fashion- 
 able accomplishments, and whose whole attention 
 seemed directed to attract admiration. 
 
 The party where he met Adelaide, was one of the 
 first of the kind which she had seen; and when Colonel 
 Algernon discovered that most of the company were 
 strangers to her, he amused her much by telling her 
 who they were, and giving her a little account of the

 ADELAIDE. 43 
 
 private history of each. In the evening, the Guests 
 did not disperse so early as such assemblages usually 
 do; the conversation turned upon Spain, and Ade- 
 laide listened with much interest to the animated de- 
 tails Colonel Algernon gave her of a Country with 
 which he had had an opportunity of becoming so well 
 acquainted. When she returned home, she artlessly 
 observed, u that she had rather dreaded the day ; 
 She had had no idea that a great dinner could be 
 such a very pleasant thing." 
 
 The following evening Miss Fauconberg met 
 Colonel Algernon at a ball ; he danced with her and 
 talked to her for so long a time, that Lady Fauconberg 
 deemed it expedient to enquire more particularly who 
 he was, and what were his expectations ? The result 
 of this investigation, though even more than satisfac- 
 tory as to the first point, did not place his prospects 
 in life in so brilliant a perspective, as to induce her to 
 wish to give up her favorite project of marrying Ade- 
 laide to Mr. Shirley. It was evident Colonel Algernon 
 was much epris with her daughter ; the prudent mother, 
 therefore, determined not to improve the impression

 by too much encouragement; and she was extremely- 
 provoked when she discovered that Sir George, (who 
 thought Henry a very agreable, intelligent young 
 man,) had, without asking her advice, invited him to 
 dinner. 
 
 " I am not sure T am glad that you have done so," 
 was her answer to this communication. 
 
 " I cannot imagine why you should object to see 
 him?" said Sir George, " he is very entertaining, 
 very much the fashion, and very civil in dancing with 
 Adelaide." 
 
 " That is just the reason of my not wishing to see 
 too much of him, he is more than half in love with her 
 already." 
 
 Sir George burst out laughing. " Really your 
 reason amuses me," replied he. " Colonel Algernon 
 certainly likes talking to Adelaide, but his being in 
 love with her is quite another thing; we have scarcely 
 known him a fortnight. If we are to exclude from 
 our parties all those who admire our Daughter, and 
 may consequently fall in love with her, we must con- 
 fine our invitations to married Men and old Bachelors;

 ADELAIDE. 45 
 
 — and in that case I imagine our dinners will not be 
 very popular. But to conclude our argument, — I 
 have asked Colonel Algernon to dine here, and there- 
 fore he must come." 
 
 " Oh undoubtedly," answered Lady Fauconberg, 
 in an offended tone. — u I only wished to give you 
 a hint which might have been attended to with ad- 
 vantage noWj but which will be quite useless later, — 
 when Adelaide's happiness may be at stake. — Yet 
 perhaps you wish to encourage Colonel Algernon's 
 advances ?" 
 
 66 Now Lady Fauconberg this is too absurd. It 
 would never have entered my brain to imagine that 
 Colonel Algernon seriously admired Adelaide, had 
 you not suggested the idea to me ; and I am not even 
 now convinced of the great probability of such a mis- 
 fortune. At all events, you must be aware that no 
 suggestion of yours concerning the interest of our be- 
 loved Child can ever be neglected by me. — But tell 
 me, should your predictions be verified to the fullest 
 extent, why need we consider the prospect of an 
 alliance with a young Man of a noble family, agre-

 able manners, and, as far as I know, of amiable cha- 
 racter, — as a great calamity ?" 
 
 " I have no personal dislike to Colonel Algernon," 
 said Lady Fauconberg, " but I thought you had 
 always wished and intended that Adelaide should 
 marry William Shirley." 
 
 " We certainly did talk of such a possibility before 
 he went abroad, but he does not seem inclined to re- 
 turn to England, and from what we have heard of 
 him lately, I do not imagine I should much like him 
 as a Son-in-law. At any rate, Adelaide cannot be 
 shut up, as in ancient times we are told the young 
 Ladies were upon the fourteenth of February, — until 
 her favored Admirer, Mr. Shirley, condescends to 
 come and knock at the door, and claim her as his 
 destined Valentine." 
 
 The conversation dropped here ; Lady Fauconberg 
 thought she had pressed her point far enough. She 
 saw that in spite of the ridicule Sir George had ex- 
 pressed at her fears, her hints had not failed to awaken 
 his attention ; and it was by no means her desire to 
 give up entirely such an acquaintance as Colonel Al- 
 gernon.

 Sir George Fauconberg, as an independent Country 
 Gentleman of good family, large fortune, and superior 
 information, — was respected and beloved by a very 
 large circle of friends and acquaintance ; he filled an 
 important place in his own county and neighbour- 
 hood — he had always lived in the best society — his 
 connections had brought him into habits of intimacy 
 with persons of the highest rank — and his popularity 
 was as universal as it was merited. His temper was 
 not ambitious ; he had always chosen his particular 
 friends and associates from his own class in life, whose 
 tastes and habits were more congenial to his own, than 
 those of persons in a more elevated station would have 
 been ; and thus he was happy in himself, and con- 
 tented with every thing around him. During the 
 first years of their marriage, Lady Fauconberg had 
 vainly endeavoured to persuade him to come into 
 Parliament, and to take some part in public affairs, 
 for which she assured him he was qualified to make 
 a very respectable if not a distinguished figure ; but 
 this attempt she had long since given up as hopeless. 
 Her own vanity, however, remained uncorrected by 
 her Husband's better sense. She courted great people,

 48 ADELAIDE. 
 
 and fine people, and leaders of fashion, — and talked 
 much of her titled acquaintance who cared little about 
 her. 
 
 As her daughter grew up, she endeavoured to ex- 
 tend her acquaintance, and looked forward with fe- 
 verish anxiety to the sensation she expected her to 
 make in the London World. Adelaide's beauty was 
 highly gratifying to her pride as well as to her affec- 
 tion, yet it was a style of beauty not particularly cal- 
 culated to strike in a ball room. Her features were 
 indeed extremely pretty, but her great charm was 
 expression; those who saw her often and knew her 
 best, generally admired her much more than stran- 
 gers. She was highly accomplished, and that seemed 
 a sure passport to admiration; yet, as Ave have before 
 mentioned, she was so averse to display, that she never 
 brought her accomplishments forward to public ob- 
 servation, when she was not absolutely obliged to do so. 
 In short, she was one of those amiable and inte- 
 resting characters, who never appear to so much ad- 
 vantage as at home and in their own family; and 
 Lady Fauconberg, fond and proud as she justly was 
 of such a daughter, could not help regretting that

 ADELAIDE. 49 
 
 she was not gifted with a more aspiring mind, and 
 that she seemed to feel so little inclination to make 
 the most of the many natural and acquired advan- 
 tages she possessed. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg gave a Ball to introduce Adelaide 
 to her acquaintance, and Sir George was much pleased 
 with the civil things that were said to him about her 
 appearance. Lady Fauconberg, however, had soon 
 the mortification to perceive that there was a certain 
 Set of fine people, the very elite of London Society, 
 from which she and Adelaide were likely to remain 
 for ever excluded. 
 
 This was the more provoking, as many, who from 
 some accidental advantage, or perhaps from assurance 
 alone, were admitted into this privileged Circle, — had 
 no better pretensions to be so than themselves. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg declaimed against the bad taste 
 and impertinence of the age, and confessed to herself 
 with bitter disappointment, (what every body feels, 
 but few people choose to allow,) that a London Life is 
 after all one continued scene of " vanity and vexation 
 of spirit."

 Lord Byron 
 
 The day that Colonel Algernon dined with Sir 
 George Fauconberg, he asked Adelaide if he should 
 have the pleasure of meeting her the following night 
 at Almacks ? She told him she should like to go there 
 very much, but that Lady Fauconberg could not obtain 
 tickets. 
 
 " That is a pity," replied he, — and then, after a few 
 minutes consideration, he added, — " If Lady Faucon- 
 berg would allow me to try what I could do for you in 
 that way, I think I could almost promise to be suc- 
 cessful. I have some interest with more than one of 
 the all-powerful Lady Patronesses."

 Adelaide thankfully accepted this offer, and referred 
 him at the same time to her Mother. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg smiled upon Colonel Algernon 
 more graciously than she had ever yet done, and in 
 her anxiety to obtain the prize he held out, she was 
 willing to overlook the motive by which she was well 
 aware he was actuated in offering it. It was settled 
 between them that he should call irpon her the next 
 day to report the success of his attempt. 
 
 The morning came, — four — five o'clock struck, and 
 still no Colonel Algernon appeared. Adelaide's anx- 
 iety became great, and she observed, iC that as he 
 did not call, she was afraid his application had failed." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg, who began to be angry, replied, 
 " I am not very much surprised ; I suspected Colonel 
 Algernon's influence was not quite so powerful as he 
 was willing to make us believe, and I suppose he is 
 now ashamed to come and tell us of his ill success." 
 
 " At any rate," said Adelaide, u it was very kind 
 of him to try to get the tickets for us." 
 
 " I wish," muttered Lady Fauconberg, a I had not 
 been foolish enough to stay at home this morning 
 waiting for him, when I had so many things to do.''

 At this moment a loud knock at the door was heard ; 
 Adelaide started up, but her heart sunk when the 
 servant entered, followed by a very dull visitor : she 
 could scarcely conceal her disappointment, which, to 
 her Mother at least, was sufficiently evident. 
 
 Other people came in ; she exerted herself to be 
 civil, but she felt an inexpressible relief when the last 
 carriage had at length driven away from the door. 
 
 It was very late, and she was preparing to go and 
 dress for dinner, when a hasty footstep upon the stair- 
 case arrested her attention ; — an instant afterwards 
 Colonel Algernon was announced. 
 
 The brilliant smile of pleasure that illuminated 
 Adelaide's expressive countenance when she saw him, 
 more than repaid him for all the trouble he had taken 
 for her that morning. He made many excuses for 
 not coming earlier ; assured Lady Fauconberg he 
 had but that moment surmounted the difficulties that 
 had impeded his negociation, and had at one time 
 made success appear more than doubtful ; " But I 
 was determined not to give up my point," said he 
 gaily, — "I would take no refusal; and yet I have 
 made but moderate terms for to-night. A new sub-

 scription begins next Wednesday, and in that I am 
 promised that your name and Miss Fauconberg's shall 
 be included." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg thanked him for having done 
 more for her than in her private opinion she had ex- 
 pected; and Adelaide expressed her gratitude very 
 warmly for the exertion he had made. 
 
 " Oh do not thank me," replied he, " any thing I 
 can do for You is a pleasure conferred upon myself;" 
 then turning to Lady Fauconberg, he continued, 
 u We have yet more business to consider ; here is a 
 ticket for Miss Fauconberg for to-night. I could not 
 possibly obtain another, but I thought you might have 
 some friend to whose care you might not perhaps, for 
 once, be unwilling to trust her." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg put on a face of consideration, — 
 a Adelaide," she said, "had never been out any where 
 without her, — she confessed she was a little particular, 
 some people might think her foolishly so. This was, 
 however, a great temptation, — she believed she must 
 for one evening depart from her general rule, and ask 
 Mrs. Cooper to be kind enough to take Adelaide to

 Almacks. As the time was so short, she would apply 
 to Mrs. Cooper in preference to any of her other 
 friends, because, as she happened to know that she 
 dined at home, she should, from her, be certain of 
 receiving a speedy answer." 
 
 A note was accordingly despatched to Mrs. Cooper, 
 and in due time a satisfactory answer was returned. 
 
 Meanwhile Colonel Algernon took leave of the two 
 ladies, but not without having first engaged Adelaide 
 to dance the first quadrille with him when they met 
 again in the evening. 
 
 The ball did not disappoint the expectations of 
 Miss Fauconberg, and to Colonel Algernon the unu- 
 sual interest it possessed, gave it the advantage of ap- 
 pearing particularly agreable. From that time, his 
 intimacy with the Fauconberg Family received no 
 material check. Lady Fauconberg could not accept 
 a favour from him, without bestowing civility in re- 
 turn. She thought, too, that the evident admiration 
 of so popular a young Man as Colonel Algernon, gave 
 Adelaide an air of fashion; and she was weak enough 
 to imagine she could continue to encourage his atten-

 tions to a certain point, and then contrive to check 
 them again whenever they might assume too serious 
 a character. It was her determination to make him 
 her tool for a season, and then throw him aside, the 
 moment she no longer found him useful. But, like 
 many other cunning people, her Ladyship over-esti- 
 mated her own abilities, — and the calculations which 
 pleased her in theory, were far too nice ever to be 
 put into practice with any chance of success. — Ade- 
 laide's affections became engaged, without her being 
 herself aware that they were so ; and her Mother 
 began to perceive, with regret, that this circumstance 
 must frustrate any other plans she might have formed 
 for her establishment, and thus destroy at once all 
 those cherished castles in the air, which her imagi- 
 nation had been building for her almost ever since her 
 birth. 
 
 Adelaide was a good horsewoman, and in the coun- 
 try she was the constant Companion of her Father's 
 rides. In London she had less time for that sort of 
 exercise, yet she frequently went out with Sir George 
 in the Park ; and after their acquaintance with Colo-

 nel Algernon, it generally happened that he joined 
 them. Indeed, Sir George, who liked his society, 
 encouraged him to do so. Adelaide never concealed 
 any thing from her mother, yet Lady Fauconberg 
 was not quite aware how much she saw of him in 
 this way. 
 
 During one of these rides, the conversation acci- 
 dentally turned upon a murder that had been recently 
 committed abroad. Colonel Algernon had not heard 
 the particulars, and Sir George related them to him 
 as he had read them in the newspaper. It was a 
 shocking story ! A young Man had shot his innocent 
 Wife in a paroxysm of jealousy, and discovering that 
 his suspicions had been unfounded, had afterwards 
 given himself up to justice, his remorse and misery 
 proving so extreme, that he wished at once to termi- 
 nate his wretched existence, and, in some measure, 
 to atone for his crime, by submitting to a disgraceful 
 death. 
 
 Colonel Algernon listened to this recital with a 
 marked attention. His face was turned away from 
 Adelaide ; but during the description of the catas-

 ADELAIDE. 57 
 
 trophe, she thought she could perceive that he actu- 
 ally shuddered. When Sir George had finished his 
 detail, his Auditor exclaimed, with great emotion, 
 " It is most horrible ! too dreadful to dwell upon ! 
 Poor miserable, misguided Wretch ! What must have 
 been the agonies of that man's conscience! From 
 my heart I pity him !" 
 
 There was something in Colonel Algernon's voice 
 and manner, when he said this, that powerfully ar- 
 rested Adelaide's attention, and she looked towards 
 him with anxious, almost fearful curiosity. 
 
 Just then, a Gentleman passed them, a sober-look- 
 ing middle-aged person, who bowed familiarly to 
 Colonel Algernon, and at the same time repeated his 
 name. Colonel Algernon turned, — he was, or Ade- 
 laide fancied he was, extremely pale ; he did not at 
 first seem to be aware who had addressed him, but a 
 minute afterwards, starting, as from a reverie, he 
 cantered on and overtook his Friend. Their meeting 
 was apparently very cordial, and they continued some 
 time in conversation. 
 
 At length Colonel Algernon turned to seek and

 rejoin Sir George and Adelaide. He informed them 
 that his Friend was a neighbour of Lord Altamont's, 
 in the country , and consequently a very old and inti- 
 mate acquaintance of his own. ' They had had,' he 
 said, 'many subjects to talk over,' but, apparently, 
 these had been of no very agreable or inspiring na- 
 ture, for during the rest of the ride, Colonel Algernon 
 remained unusually thoughtful and absent. He and 
 his Companions jmrted at the gate of the Park. Ade- 
 laide rode on in silence. 
 
 " What shall I give you for your thoughts ?" ex- 
 claimed Sir George. 
 
 " They are worth little or nothing," replied she ; 
 then added, with a smile, u You will perhaps laugh 
 at me if I tell you that I was reflecting upon the 
 nature of courage, or rather upon the difference be- 
 tween true and false courage." 
 
 " A very philosophical and profound meditation 
 indeed. And pray, Adelaide, what induced you to 
 entertain it at this moment ?" 
 
 " The dreadful story you told Colonel Algernon 
 this morning. Did you observe how much he was 
 affected by it ?"

 ADELAIDE. 59 
 
 u I did," replied Sir George ; " I thought he 
 shewed much more emotion than I should have ex- 
 pected. I hope you do not argue that the Colonel's 
 sensibility, in this instance, arose from any feeling of 
 cowardice." 
 
 " Very far from it," hastily answered Adelaide ; 
 and she half blushed as she continued, — u It was 
 that very sensibility that I admired ; do you not 
 think it the brightest ornament of true courage ? 
 We know Colonel Algernon is chivalorously brave ; 
 that he has been familiarized with scenes of blood 
 and death, as they occur in honorable warfare ; yet 
 all these horrors have not blunted his naturally hu- 
 mane feelings. I own I was much struck when I 
 saw him shudder at the relation of a murder, — and, 
 while he showed such abhorrence of his crime, ex- 
 press pity too for the wretchedness of the miserable 
 and cowardly assassin, who had bathed his hands in 
 the blood of his own wife." 
 
 " Your eulogium is so eloquent," observed her 
 father, " that if I were not afraid it might turn his 
 head, I could almost regret that Colonel Alger-

 non cannot hear it. You have managed your subject 
 so ingeniously, that, with very little more arrange- 
 ment, it might make its appearance, in the fonn of a 
 very pretty Essay, in the Ladies' Magazine, or some 
 such fugitive publication. But, to speak seriously, 
 my dear Adelaide, you need never be afraid of my 
 laughing at any reflections of yours. It is a rational, 
 as well as an improving amusement, to work out a 
 subject in this way in your own mind, — taking, per- 
 haps, for your text, (as you have done to-day,) some 
 circumstance or example that may have occurred 
 within your immediate observation. I highly approve 
 of such a practice, provided you only indulge it at 
 proper times and seasons : — in other words, in suit- 
 able places, in solitary hours, and not again in my 
 society."

 The London season was now drawing" to a conclu- 
 sion ; Sir George and Lady Fauconberg had this year 
 remained in town longer than usual, to allow their 
 Daughter to enjoy a full share of all the gaieties that 
 had been going on ; but the day of their departure for 
 Fauconberg Manor was at length fixed, and Adelaide 
 could not help looking forward to it with a feeling of 
 regret that she was at a loss to explain to herself. It 
 puzzled and mortified her, for the prospect of return- 
 ing to the Country had always before given her the 
 greatest pleasure. Could her introduction to the 
 world, — and the dissipation of three short months, 
 have completely changed her character and unsettled

 all her former ideas ? She hoped this was impossible, 
 yet as the period of removal drew nearer, her reluc- 
 tance to leave London, sensibly increased. 
 
 She had one morning taken out her drawings that 
 she might pack them up to be sent into the country. 
 This occupation naturally led her thoughts to the sub- 
 ject of her approaching journey ; reflection succeeded 
 reflection, and the drawings remained unheeded upon 
 the sofa beside her, till she was unexpectedly roused 
 from her reverie by the entrance of Colonel Algernon, 
 who was not usually so early a visitor. She started 
 violently when she saw him, and the deep blush that 
 spread itself over her whole face, seemed almost to 
 confess that his apj^earance had suddenly revealed to 
 her mind the secret she had hitherto endeavoured in 
 vain to comprehend. 
 
 Colonel Algernon fixed his eyes for an instant upon 
 Adelaide's countenance with an expression of deep 
 interest and curiosity ; their eyes met, and hers sunk 
 beneath his glance, — but her embarrassment was re- 
 lieved by the approach of Lady Fauconberg, who had 
 been writing at the further end of the room, and who

 ADELAIDE. 63 
 
 now came forward to receive her Guest. Colonel Al- 
 gernon staid with the two Ladies a very long time, he 
 was in high spirits, and Adelaide thought she had 
 never before seen him half so agreable. Since she 
 had known him well, she had observed that in spite 
 of his natural gaiety, he frequently appeared thought- 
 ful, almost melancholy ; but that day there was an air 
 of happiness about him, that communicated itself to 
 every thing around him. 
 
 At length Colonel Algernon got up to go away, 
 declaring that difficult as he found it to tear himself 
 from such society, his conscience would not allow him 
 to encroach longer upon Lady Fauconberg's time ; — 
 and then first perceiving Adelaide's scattered draw- 
 ings and other preparations for departure, he said, u I 
 fear I have interrupted you sadly, you must have a 
 great many things to do." 
 
 " That empty Porte Feuille," replied Miss Faucon- 
 berg, with a smile, " is a shocking evidence of my idle- 
 ness, it ought to have been packed up three hours 
 ago, but it shall not reproach me many moments 
 longer."

 64 ADELAIDE. 
 
 u Those are drawings I suppose that you are car- 
 rying* into the country to copy." And as he spoke, 
 Colonel Algernon took up one of them which hap- 
 pened to be nearest to him. 
 
 " Most of them are," answered Adelaide. " That 
 one," added she with a feeling of almost painful diffi- 
 dence of its merit, U is a thing of my own." 
 
 Colonel Algernon had taken up the drawing care- 
 lessly, probably as an excuse for lingering where he 
 was, he now examined it with the greatest attention, 
 observing, u I did not imagine you could have found 
 time to draw here ; — it is very well done — the colour- 
 ing is soft — the touch beautiful ! Pray shew me some 
 more of your drawings." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg understood nothing about draw- 
 ing herself, but she considered it a necessary accom- 
 plishment for her Daughter, and having given her one 
 of the best Masters London could furnish, and heard 
 him constantly commend her assiduity, and bestow un- 
 qualified praise upon her performances, she had no 
 doubt he had made her a most excellent artist. Ade- 
 laide herself entertained a much more humble opi-

 nion of her proficiency ; she took great pains to pro- 
 fit by the instructions that were given her, but she 
 went on as it were mechanically. She had formed 
 no taste of her own, and she always took up her pen- 
 cil rather as a task than as an amusement. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's pride was much gratified by 
 Colonel Algernon's admiration of Adelaide's works. 
 She placed one of her landscapes by the side of the 
 study from which it had been copied, and observed, 
 that " Adelaide's master had been particularly pleased 
 with that view, — he had said that her copy was even 
 more spirited and better done than the original. 
 
 Adelaide blushed deeply at this exaggerated praise. 
 u It is indeed admirably copied," replied Colonel 
 Algernon ; then turning to Miss Fauconberg, he 
 added, " These I think are all copies. Have you 
 nothing here that is entirely your own ? Surely you 
 sometimes draw from nature." 
 
 " I have frequently tried to do so," said Adelaide, 
 u but my attempts were always failures. I at length 
 became convinced that I had no original genius, and 
 therefore determined to content myself by imitating

 what had already been more ably traced out for me 
 by others." 
 
 " If you will allow me to say so, I believe you 
 were much mistaken in this estimate of your own abi- 
 lities. I am persuaded, from what I have seen this 
 morning, that you might succeed in any style." 
 
 a That is just my opinion," observed Lady Fau- 
 conberg. " I have often told Adelaide, that all she 
 wanted was a little more confidence in her own 
 powers." 
 
 " You would, perhaps," continued Colonel Alger- 
 non, " find drawing from nature rather difficult at 
 first, and you would require somebody to put you in 
 the right way ; but a little perseverance would con- 
 quer all the difficulties, and you would soon find that 
 sort of drawing so much more interesting than copy- 
 ing as you do at present, that you would be amply 
 rewarded for your trouble. I do not pretend to be 
 much of an artist myself, but I have been a good deal 
 in the way of seeing pictures, and have lived much 
 with those who understand them ; I should be parti- 
 cularly happy if any hints of mine could be of use to

 you, or if you would employ me to find some one 
 better qualified to give you assistance and instruction 
 than I am." 
 
 It is unnecessary to detail the long and luminous 
 discussion upon Painting, in all its branches, that fol- 
 lowed this opening*. Lady Fauconberg heard it at 
 first with impatience, but afterwards with less dissatis- 
 faction, for she had acuteness enough to perceive that 
 the Lecture was a very instructive one to her Daughter. 
 
 Adelaide listened to it with the most flattering 
 attention and curiosity. She soon began to discover 
 how much interest she could take in pictures, and 
 how greatly she should like to understand more about 
 them. Colonel Algernon seemed well inclined to 
 give her all the information in his power ; but their 
 conversation was at length suddenly interrupted by 
 the entrance of the two Miss Shirley's. 
 
 Neither the animation of the Colonel's voice and 
 gesture, or Adelaide's look of deep attention, at the 
 moment the door was opened, — had escaped Julia's 
 quick glance ; she had perceived too, the expression 
 of vexation which they were both unable entirely to

 conceal, when she and her sister was announced, and 
 she determined not to lose such an opportunity of 
 tormenting them. While Emily seated herself beside 
 Lady Fauconberg, to talk over some evening engage- 
 ments she wished to arrange with her, Julia therefore 
 advanced towards the table, near which Colonel Al- 
 gernon was still standing, and commenced her attack. 
 " I am terribly afraid," said she, w that we have in- 
 terrupted some very interesting discussion ; do, pray, 
 Colonel Algernon, begin declaiming again, it will be 
 very agreable to me to benefit by your observations." 
 Then, as he did not immediately comply with her 
 request, she continued, u But if your oratory is re- 
 served for Adelaide only, I will go and sit down by 
 my Sister, and promise, like a good Child, neither to 
 speak to you or to listen to what you are saying, till 
 you call me and allow me to do so." 
 
 During this speech, Adelaide's face grew crimson 
 to the very brow ; Colonel Algernon, without appear- 
 ing to notice this circumstance, answered Julia in her 
 own way. u Have you not always remarked, Miss 
 Shirley, that a person who is desired to be entertain-

 ADELAIDE. 69 
 
 ing, instantly loses the power of obeying the com- 
 mand ? This is unfortunately my case just now. If 
 I felt that any observations of mine could prove either 
 agreable or beneficial to you, I need not assure you 
 that I should, at any moment, be too much flattered 
 by your condescending to attend to them." 
 
 Julia was checked, but not silenced; she changed 
 her ground, and, turning to Miss Fauconberg, said to 
 her, — " So you are really going to leave London 
 next Monday, Adelaide ! And, what is more extra- 
 ordinary, I hear you are quite delighted at the 
 thoughts of returning to the country." 
 
 The voice and manner in which Adelaide replied, 
 a I shall indeed be very happy to see Fauconberg 
 again," accorded very ill with her words. 
 
 Julia continued, — u Well, you are the most pro- 
 voking, extraordinary Person in the world. Do you 
 not remember how often last spring, when you used 
 to regret the prospect of leaving your Garden and all 
 your amusements in the Country, I told you, that be- 
 fore you had been in Town three months, as a come 
 out young Lady, you would feel much more reluctant

 to return to these rural pleasures, than you then did 
 to go away from them. I was more than half in- 
 clined to quarrel with you for disputing the truth of 
 my prophecy, but the event has proved that you were 
 right, (as you generally are,) and that I was wrong. 
 This is all praiseworthy, and as it should be, — yet 
 with my feelings, and if I was situated as you are, 
 and had so many admirers to bid adieu to, I should 
 be very apt to think, while I was tying up my roses, 
 how very soon the absent are forgotten or replaced in 
 our affections." 
 
 " Miss Shirley judges of others by herself, I pre- 
 sume," observed Colonel Algernon ; and the remark, 
 though not directly addressed to either of the young 
 Ladies, was heard by both. 
 
 " Julia," said Adelaide, as she bent over her Porte 
 Feuille, " Instead of talking nonsense, I wish you 
 would help me to pack up these drawings." 
 
 Colonel Algernon came also to assist her, and the 
 task proceeded rapidly. 
 
 u This is good practice for me," observed Julia, 
 w since I must in a few days begin to pack up my

 own effects. How much longer shall you remain in 
 town, Colonel Algernon V 
 
 " I hope to be able to get away in about a fort- 
 night." 
 
 6i That will be some time before the Grouse shoot- 
 ing begins," remarked Julia. 
 
 " I am not thinking of the moors. I am going to 
 the West of England, to Lord Altamont's." 
 
 " That is very dutiful and proper," continued 
 Julia, " had you intended to turn your steps towards 
 the northern wilds, I am sure it would have given my 
 Father great pleasure to have seen you at Greyfield. 
 We could perhaps have contrived to amuse you, for I 
 believe my Brother will be home very early in the 
 autumn." 
 
 " Do you expect Mr. Shirley to be back so soon ?" 
 asked Adelaide, with some surprise. 
 
 " Yes, my Father received a letter from him this 
 morning, announcing such a welcome intention. Mr. 
 Shirley did you call him? You are grown very re- 
 spectful, Adelaide. Yet I must confess that if Wil- 
 liam's friends have forgotten him, it is his own fault

 in having staid so long abroad. Every body has 
 ceased to care for him but his own family, and per- 
 haps Lady Fauconberg ; he was always a great fa- 
 vorite of her 's." 
 
 When first Julia mentioned her brother's return, 
 Adelaide started and coloured, and she was aware that 
 Colonel Algernon observed her do so, yet she instant- 
 ly recovered her composure, and looking Julia stead- 
 ily in the face, replied, " Mama I know did, and 
 does think very highly of your Brother, and i" should 
 be extremely ungrateful if I were not to recollect how 
 good natured he used to be to me when I was a Child. 
 I congratulate you with all my heart upon the plea- 
 sure you must all feel at the prospect of his return." 
 
 This frank avowal of her sentiments completely 
 silenced her tormentor, and cleared away the cloud of 
 anxiety that had been gathering upon Colonel Alger- 
 non's brow. The Porte Feuille was finished and tied 
 up, and as he took leave of the young Ladies, he con- 
 trived to whisper to Adelaide, " we shall meet I hope 
 to-night at Lady Wilmington's." 
 
 After the departure of the Miss Shirley's, Lady

 Fauconberg, who had bills to look over and people 
 upon business to speak to, desired that no more visi- 
 tors might be admitted. 
 
 Adelaide retired to her own room to meditate upon 
 the occurrences of the morning. She had much sub- 
 ject for reflection. The secret of her own heart had 
 been revealed to her. She had good reason to think 
 that she was beloved by the object of her preference, 
 that her Father favoured his hopes, and that her Mo- 
 ther did not seem inclined to oppose them. A train 
 of ideas as new as they were delightful, opened upon 
 her mind, and when her Maid came to warn her that 
 it was time to dress, she was quite astonished to find 
 how late it was. 
 
 Adelaide was in general very indifferent about her 
 toilette, but this evening it appeared to give her unu- 
 sual trouble. Every thing she put on looked unbe- 
 coming, her flowers were awkwardly placed, her curls 
 twisted themselves the wrong way, and when her 
 maid went down stairs, she declared, u she could not 
 imagine what had happened to Miss Fauconberg ! 
 she had never seen her so particular, or so hard to 
 please, in her life."

 Lady Wilmington's ball was very pleasant and very 
 crowded. Colonel Algernon was one of the first peo- 
 ple Lady Fauconberg and her Daughter saw when they 
 arrived, and he immediately joined them. The night 
 wore on. The suite of larger rooms was terminated 
 by a Boudoir hung with muslin draperies, and orna- 
 mented by a profusion of flowers. Every body looked 
 into this Fairy Apartment to admire the Roses and 
 Geraniums, and a few of the Dancers had taken their 
 Partners there to find a quiet seat, or to talk over 
 affairs too interesting to be discussed in a crowd. 
 Colonel Algernon led Adelaide to one of the vacant 
 sofas, and when they had duly commented for a few 
 moments upon the wonders of nature and art by 
 which they were surrounded, he said to her, " After 
 I left you this morning, I had the good fortune to fall 
 in with Sir George ; we rode together for some time, 
 and he was kind enough to ask me to come and see 
 him at Fauconberg Manor." 
 
 " And I hope,'' replied Adelaide, " that you in- 
 tend to accept his invitation."

 my Grandfather. It is my duty to pay him this at- 
 tention, and my inclination would at any rate have 
 prompted me to do so ; hut there is at this moment 
 another very powerful reason which makes me parti- 
 cularly desirous to see him as soon as possible." 
 
 The striking peculiarity of Colonel Algernon's tone 
 and manner, expressed even more than his words. 
 Adelaide made no reply. She did not venture to 
 raise her eyes from a bunch of roses that seemed to 
 have particularly attracted her attention, — leaf after 
 leaf was unconsciously pulled off, and at last as she 
 twisted the stalk that supported one of the buds, 
 u She snapped it, — it fell to the ground 1" 
 Colonel Algernon immediately snatched it up, 
 pressed it to his lips, and then placed it close to his 
 heart. 
 
 An awkward sort of a pause ensued till he resumed 
 the broken thread of the conversation by giving Miss 
 Fauconberg a description of Altamont Castle. He 
 then told her the story of his Father's unfortunate 
 marriage, related all the calamities that had befallen 
 his family, expatiated upon the kindness he had re-

 ceived from Lord Altamont since his Mother's death, 
 talked of his childhood and education, and described 
 the happy feeling of independence he had experi- 
 enced when he first joined his Regiment, and was sent 
 upon Foreign Service to fight his own way in the 
 world. 
 
 a And nobly have you done so," exclaimed Ade- 
 laide, " your's has been an honorable and a brilliant 
 career." Then as if half ashamed of the warmth with 
 which she had spoken, she stopped suddenly. 
 
 Colonel Algernon who had felt deeply gratified by 
 the interest she had evidently taken in all his details ; 
 replied with much emotion, " I speak very seriously 
 when I tell you that it would makg me inexpressibly 
 happy if I could feel that I had merited your praise." 
 
 At this moment Lady Fauconberg entered the bou- 
 doir, and addressing her Daughter, said in an angry 
 voice, " I have been looking for you this hour Ade- 
 laide, I could not imagine where you were? I am 
 tired to death. I promised to take home the Miss 
 Shirley's, and they have both been ready to go away 
 some time."

 " I am extremely sorry Mama, that I have kept 
 you waiting-," replied Adelaide, and glancing her 
 eye round the room she perceived that every body but 
 Colonel Algernon and herself had left it. She hastily 
 took his arm, while he offered the other to Lady Fau- 
 conberg, and was too much engrossed with her own 
 thoughts to care for the raillery with which Julia 
 assailed her during their drive home. 
 
 Adelaide went up to bed, but she had been too 
 much excited, and she was still in far too happy a 
 frame of mind to be able to sleep. She could no longer 
 doubt Colonel Algernon's attachment, and she felt 
 almost equally sure that he only delayed declaring it 
 more openly till he had obtained his Grandfather's 
 sanction to do so. The weighty reason that made him 
 so particularly anxious to see Lord Altamont, could be 
 no other than a desire to ascertain his sentiments upon 
 this point. She recalled minutely all the different 
 parts of his narration, and when at length she fell 
 asleep, it was only to trace in disjointed dreams the 
 subject that had so agreably occupied her waking 
 thoughts.

 Lady Fauconberg's restless reflections were of a 
 much less pleasing nature. She had watched with 
 painful anxiety the progress of the growing attach- 
 ment between Colonel Algernon and her Daughter. 
 Having in the first instance been induced by interest- 
 ed motives to sanction his attentions, she could after- 
 wards find no excuse for looking" more coldly upon 
 him; nor had she any good reason to plead to Sir 
 George for objecting to his alliance, even if her worst 
 apprehensions should be realized. 
 
 From Adelaide she had carefully concealed her 
 uneasiness, hoping that she might continue too art- 
 less to understand her own sentiments, and believing 
 her to be too free from vanity to be aware of the ex- 
 tent of Colonel Algernon's admiration. Could she 
 have kept her thus in ignorance till she left Town, 
 she had fancied that all might yet have gone right;— 
 she had ascertained, even before his own family were 
 aware of the circumstance, that Mr. Shirley was likely 
 to return home in a very short time, and she trusted 
 that before she brought her Daughter back to London 
 the following spring, it was not impossible she might 
 be at least his affianced Bride.

 But the observation of the last twelve hours had 
 convinced Lady Fauconberg that things were advan- 
 cing much more rapidly to a crisis than she had ima- 
 gined. Colonel Algernon's devotion to Miss Fau- 
 conberg had become evident to every body. She was 
 too clear-sighted not to have perceived that Adelaide's 
 own eyes had been opened ; and when she entered the 
 Boudoir at Lady Wilmington's, she more than half sus- 
 pected that an explanation had actually taken place. 
 Her Daughter's silence upon her return home, proved 
 that this supposition had been erroneous. Plan after 
 plan she formed and rejected, for none seemed to pro- 
 mise her any chance of averting the impending evil ; 
 and at last she fretted herself almost into a state of 
 despair. 
 
 The next morning, when the Fauconberg family 
 were assembled at breakfast, Sir George said to his 
 daughter, u I met your friend Colonel Algernon yes- 
 terday Adelaide, he told me he had been here and 
 had found you engaged in the odious occupation of 
 packing. He really looked so woe-begone when he 
 talked of the approaching prospect of taking leave of

 us all, that in christian charity I thought I could not 
 do less than ask him to come and see us in the country." 
 
 At this communication both Mother and Daughter 
 changed colour, and while the former with difficulty 
 restrained herself from expressing her vexation, the 
 latter replied, u Colonel Algernon told me last night 
 of the kind invitation you had given him. He intends 
 I believe, to come down to Fauconberg as soon as he 
 returns from a visit to Lord Altamont." 
 
 " I shall be very glad to see him whenever that 
 may be," continued Sir George, " I much admire the 
 motive that takes him in the first instance to visit his 
 Grandfather." 
 
 And as Adelaide's blushes grew deeper and deeper, 
 he continued, with a smile, " I cannot help admiring, 
 too, the brilliancy of your complexion this morning, 
 my Love; I rejoice to find that the late hours you 
 have been keeping lately have not, in any degree, 
 diminished your bloom." 
 
 Adelaide was so overpowered by the consciousness 
 of all that had been passing in her own mind, that 
 she felt quite incapable of attempting to parry her

 Father's attack. Her confusion visibly increased, and 
 at length the tears rose in her eyes. 
 
 " My dear Child, I did not intend to distress you," — 
 said Sir George, very kindly, — u Poor little silly 
 thing! you need not look so guilty. When I find 
 reason to believe Colonel Algernon less worthy of my 
 esteem than I think him at present, you may blush if 
 I mention his name; there is no occasion to do so when 
 I praise him. And, now, go up stairs to the drawing- 
 room and fetch me yesterday's newspaper; there is 
 something in it J want to look back to." 
 
 Adelaide smiled through her tears, as she affec- 
 tionately kissed the hand her Father held out to her, 
 and then darted up stairs to execute his commission, 
 and conceal her own emotion. The instant she closed 
 the door behind her, Lady Fauconberg exclaimed, 
 " Am I to understand, Sir George, that Colonel Al- 
 gernon has proposed for Adelaide ?" 
 
 u I am not aware of his having done so," replied 
 her Husband, " but I have very little doubt that he 
 intends it." 
 
 " That is a very different thing," continued her

 Ladyship, her voice trembling with anger. " I should 
 have thought it would have been quite time enough 
 to have mentioned the subject to your Daughter, when 
 he had actually declared his sentiments. Your talk- 
 ing to her beforehand, in the way you have just been 
 doing, may be the cause of much mischief; of blight- 
 ing her future prospects in life ; perhaps even of 
 breaking her heart." 
 
 " I do not understand what you can possibly mean ? 
 — As to my breaking her heart, — the few words to 
 which you seem to attach such undue importance, 
 were merely spoken with the intention of relieving 
 her from any uneasiness she might have felt about 
 my opinion of her own conduct, or my sentiments in 
 regard to Colonel Algernon." 
 
 "Or, — expressing the case more plainly," observed 
 Lady Fauconberg, " to encourage her in a romantic 
 attachment for a young Man, who, deeply as he 
 appears to he in love with her at this moment, may 
 never perhaps, after all, have entertained any serious 
 intention of marrying her." 
 
 " You do great injustice both to me and to Colonel

 Algernon," replied Sir George. u Had I not believed 
 him to be far too honorable to endeavour to engage 
 Adelaide's affections, without previously wishing and 
 intending to marry her, you may be sure I should 
 not have allowed him to see so much of her as he has 
 done." 
 
 u Since you are so perfectly satisfied that all is 
 just as it should be, i" can have nothing more to say.— 
 Considering that we are both equally interested in 
 Adelaide's happiness, I confess I might have ex- 
 pected that you would have given me some hint of 
 your views, before you made your final decision upon 
 so vitally important a point." 
 
 " Lady Fauconberg," exclaimed Sir George, a this 
 is more than I can bear ! When did I ever fail to 
 consult with you upon any concern that could be of 
 interest or importance to either of us ? And when I 
 have done so, I might also ask, if I have not gene- 
 rally found you inclined to contradict my opinions, 
 and thwart my wishes ? But let that pass. — You 
 cannot have forgotten, that very soon after our arri- 
 val in town, you mentioned to me Colonel Algernon's

 admiration of Adelaide, and urged the expediency of 
 our giving up his acquaintance, hut upon what 
 ground, I could not then, or can I now discover. 
 We talked the matter over pretty freely, and con- 
 cluded our discussion by agreeing that it was not quite 
 possible to recal an invitation to dinner which I had 
 previously given to the object of your apprehension. 
 He came — and so much did the prejudice you had 
 entertained against him, appear to be removed, that 
 the very next day you accepted his assistance in pro- 
 curing you tickets for Almacks. From that time I 
 have seen him constantly in your society, and instead 
 of your disapproving of his attentions to your Daugh- 
 ter, it always seemed to me that you rather encou- 
 raged them. As you had yourself foreseen in the 
 first instance the probability of their leading to an 
 ultimate and mutual attachment, I never should for 
 an instant have imagined it possible that you should 
 afterwards have become blind to what was visible 
 enough to every one else. For my own part, I had 
 liked this young Man from the hour I was introduced 
 to him, and every thing I have seen or heard of him

 since, has confirmed the good opinion I was then 
 inclined to form of him. His character stands very 
 high, his talents are of no common order, — and as 
 for worldly advantages, he possesses every one of them 
 except fortune, and since Miss Fauconberg will here- 
 after be an Heiress, it is not indispensably requisite 
 that her Husband should be very rich. — To cut a long 
 argument short at once, I shall merely observe, that I 
 am persuaded I should never have heard any of these 
 nonsensical objections to Colonel Algernon, if you 
 were not constantly returning to your chimerical plan 
 of marrying Adelaide to William Shirley, who has 
 treated his own Family with so much neglect lately, 
 that I confess I feel little desire to receive him into 
 mine." 
 
 " Well Sir George, I wish you joy of the Son- 
 in-law of your choice, and 1 only hope you may never 
 find reason to repent of the selection you have made." 
 
 The re-entrance of Adelaide put a final stop to 
 this disagreable matrimonial altercation. Sir George 
 and Lady Fauconberg saw but little of each other 
 during the few duys they remained in London ; they

 did not attempt to renew their dispute, but the dif- 
 ference of opinion that existed between them, made 
 them feel far from comfortable as companions in a 
 tete-a-tete. 
 
 Colonel Algernon and Adelaide met several times, 
 and that class of people who make it the business of 
 their lives to observe and report the proceedings of 
 their neighbours, remarked that upon all these occa- 
 sions a most happy understanding seemed to be esta- 
 blished between them. A considerate manoeuvre of 
 Lady Fauconberg's spared them the pain of a regular 
 parting ; but in the course of their last ride together, 
 Colonel Algernon had arranged with Sir George that 
 he should write to him from Altamont Castle as soon 
 as he had ascertained when he should be able to go 
 down to the north ; " I hope," concluded he, " that 
 you will then be kind enough to name the earliest 
 period when it may be convenient to you to receive 
 me. As far as it depends upon myself I trust there 
 can be nothing to prevent my seeing you within a 
 month from this time."

 Julia Shirley had indeed spoken prophetically 
 when she said that Adelaide would feel pleasure in 
 returning to the country. The weight that oppressed 
 her spirits had been removed, and she looked at every 
 thing at Fauconberg with a new interest when she 
 anticipated the satisfaction she should enjoy in showing 
 the place to Colonel Algernon. She had so much to 
 do, and so many people to visit, that a fortnight was 
 speedily gone ; — and she tied up her flowers without

 experiencing any apprehension, though absent, — of 
 being* forgotten. — A month passed away, and she 
 began to wonder that her Father had received no let- 
 ter from Colonel Algernon. Another month succeed- 
 ed, — still he had neither written or appeared; her 
 heart sunk, and deeply and silently she felt the sicken- 
 ing pang of hope deferred. 
 
 Adelaide could not entertain a doubt that at the 
 time Colonel Algernon had received Sir George's 
 invitation, he had been perfectly sincere in his inten- 
 tion and desire to accept it as soon as possible ; and 
 she tormented herself with vain conjectures about the 
 cause of his extraordinary silence. Could he have 
 been ill ? Could he have been unable to get leave of 
 absence? In either case he could have written to 
 her father. — Could Lord Altamont have disapproved 
 of his attachment, and enjoined him to give up the 
 further pursuit of views he had inexorably refused to 
 sanction? — This idea seemed to Adelaide to be but 
 too probable. She did not feel the mortification of 
 supposing that the old Peer could have made any per- 
 sonal objection to herself, since he had never seen her,

 ADELAIDE. 89 
 
 and most likely had not been even aware of her exis- 
 tence. But he might have formed other matrimonial 
 projects for his Grandson; — perhaps he might not 
 wish him to marry at all. — After all that Colonel Al- 
 gernon had told her about his Father and Mother ; — 
 and from the whole tenor of his conversation at Lady 
 Wilmington's, she felt quite sure that he would never 
 contract any engagement in opposition to Lord Alta- 
 mont. She felt too that if she could believe him ca- 
 pable of doing so, the esteem and admiration she en- 
 tertained for his character, would be much diminished. 
 The conviction therefore which daily gained strength 
 in her mind, that his absence had been occasioned by 
 a prohibition from his Grandfather, was extremely 
 painful. — Still it was much less so than supposing it 
 had been caused by any change in his own sentiments ; 
 and such a supposition she never did for one instant 
 allow herself to encourage. 
 
 Sir George Fauconberg was scarcely less surprised 
 than his Daughter at hearing no intelligence of Colonel 
 Algernon, and he had at first expressed this feeling- 
 very freely, sometimes in joke, and sometimes in

 earnest. " If the Colonel," he frequently said, 
 "was a Fine Gentleman, a Youth who could easily 
 forget his Country Friends, I should he much in- 
 clined to think that he had forgotten every body at 
 Fauconberg ; — but He is not that sort of person, — 
 whenever we see or hear from him I am convinced 
 he will be able to give us a satisfactory explanation 
 of conduct that now appears very extraordinary. We 
 will not condemn him until we know what he has to 
 say in his defence. 
 
 Upon these occasions, Lady Fauconberg generally 
 said little, but she seldom failed to direct a glance 
 towards her husband, which expressed a great deal. 
 
 At length the worthy Baronet's patience became 
 exhausted. He perceived, in spite of Adelaide's 
 efforts to conceal her anxiety, that she often looked 
 pensive and thoughtful ; that her gaiety was less na- 
 tural than it used to be, — and he was at no loss to 
 discover whose hand had planted the thorn that was 
 destroying her peace of mind. It appeared to him 
 that the feelings of his beloved Child had been trifled 
 with, — that Colonel Algernon, regardless of the effect

 it might afterwards have upon her happiness, had 
 been heartless enough to engage her in a flirtation, 
 which had no other object than his own amusement; 
 and, under this impression, his indignation against 
 him was unbounded. He ceased to mention or allude 
 to him in Adelaide's presence: he treated her with 
 even more than his accustomed tenderness; and he 
 kindly endeavoured to divert her thoughts from dwel- 
 ling upon painful recollections. In this task Sir George 
 found an able and willing assistant in Lady Faucon- 
 berg, who to his surprise and satisfaction had openly 
 expressed no triumph at the proof she had given of 
 superior discernment, in detecting Colonel Algernon's 
 real character. The truth was, that though she had 
 been both astonished and puzzled by his conduct, she 
 did not view it in the same light as her Husband. She 
 was convinced he had been seriously in love with 
 Adelaide, she knew that his marrying her would 
 have been extremely advantageous to himself, she 
 therefore privately concluded that his absence must 
 have been occasioned by some unforeseen and extra- 
 ordinary obstacle. What that obstacle might be she

 found it impossible to imagine, and she only hoped it 
 would never be removed until her own wishes for 
 Adelaide were accomplished. 
 
 It was at this juncture that Mr. Shirley returned to 
 England. The moment appeared to be propitious. 
 His admiration of Adelaide was sufficiently evident, 
 and every thing seemed to conspire to favor Lady 
 Fauconberg's plans. Sir George had been too much 
 mortified and disgusted with Colonel Algernon, to 
 think with pleasure of any Son-in-law. He could not 
 quite bring himself to like Mr. Shirley, but he fairly 
 told Lady Fauconberg that he was determined not to 
 allow himself to be influenced by any little prejudices 
 of his own. 
 
 " Should William Shirley ever propose for Ade- 
 laide," he said, " and should She wish to accept his 
 proposal, / could not possibly object to their union. 
 After what has happened, I am resolved however to 
 take no steps to promote any alliance ; and you know 
 me well enough, to be sure I will give my consent to 
 none which our Daughter can feel the slightest reluc- 
 tance to enter into."

## p. 93 (#115) #############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 93 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was satisfied with this declaration, 
 but she had the mortification of finding- that neither 
 her own influence or Mr. Shirley's devoted attentions 
 could make the least impression upon Adelaide's heart. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg had been deeply sensible of the 
 kindness her Father and Mother had shewn her 
 after her disappointment. Her gratitude towards 
 them, aided by a higher principle of duty, had led 
 her to strive hard to overcome all feelings of useless 
 regret; and she had so far succeeded that her former 
 cheerfulness of temper seemed to have returned. 
 
 Yet the image of Colonel Algernon was too recent 
 in her recollection, and her preference for him "was 
 still too deeply rooted, to be effaced by any new com- 
 petitor. She could never entirely banish a vague 
 hope that she might meet him again in London in 
 the Spring, and that a satisfactory explanation might 
 take place between them. In this state of her mind, 
 her feelings towards Mr. Shirley could only be those 
 of indifference, and she took every opportunity of en- 
 deavouring to make him understand that she could 
 not return his attachment. She dreaded his visits

 94 ADELAIDE. 
 
 because she perceived how much her Mother encou- 
 raged his attentions, and how determined she was to 
 exert all her influence with Sir George in his favour. 
 
 It is now high time to explain what Colonel Al- 
 gernon had really been doing with himself since we 
 took leave of him in London. 
 
 He went down to Altamont Castle, as he had in- 
 tended, and upon arriving there was much shocked to 
 observe the alteration that had taken place in his 
 Grandfather's appearance. Mrs. Algernon, (his aunt) 
 told him that Lord Altamont had looked very ill for 
 some time, but that he did not like to be considered 
 an Invalid, and that she had been unable to persuade 
 him to consult any medical person. 
 
 A few days' observation convinced Colonel Alger- 
 non that his apprehensions had been too well founded. 
 The poor old Peer, whose malady might have been of 
 little consequence if it had been attended to at first — 
 grew rapidly worse from having been so long neg- 
 lected : and he ceased to make any opposition to the 
 desire his Grandson expressed to send for the most 
 skilful Physician the neighbourhood afforded.

## p. 95 (#117) #############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 95 
 
 When Colonel Algernon followed the Doctor out of 
 his patient's room, the latter shook his head as he ob- 
 served, u This is a very bad case : — I trust it is not 
 quite a hopeless one, but I think it right to inform 
 you that Lord Altamont is in great danger." 
 
 Henry had not been unprepared for this communi- 
 cation, yet he was excessively affected at receiving it. 
 
 For more than a week he watched day and night 
 by Lord Altamont's bed side. At length the violence 
 of the fever began to abate, and he was cheered with 
 a hope that his Grandfather's life might be spared ; 
 he felt a pleasing consciousness, too, that his own un- 
 wearied attentions had, under Providence, been high- 
 ly instrumental in promoting his recovery. During 
 the painful period of his anxiety, Adelaide had been 
 never absent from Colonel Algernon's recollection. 
 The time was now come when he had hoped he 
 might have been at Fauconberg, and he determined to 
 write to Sir George to tell him how impossible he found 
 it to leave his charge at Altamont Castle. His Grand- 
 father, though much better, had not yet been pro- 
 nounced quite out of danger ; he briefly but feelingly

 described his illness, said that the most favorable re- 
 covery he could hope for must be so tardy, that he 
 should endeavour to remain with him as long as he 
 could obtain leave to do so ; and concluded by ex- 
 pressing a hope that he might be allowed to remind 
 Sir George of the kind invitation he had given him to 
 Fauconberg, the first moment he might be able to 
 accept it. 
 
 He sealed this letter with an aching heart, and was 
 surprised to find he had been so long composing it, 
 that the regular letter bag had been gone some time. 
 He resolved to send it by his own Servant to the 
 Post-Office, together with some other less important 
 despatches which he had also neglected to exjDedite. 
 
 When the destined Messenger was summoned to 
 his Master's presence, he was making merry in the 
 Servant's Hall, and doing the honors of Lord Alta- 
 mont's good ale to a Friend who had brought a note 
 of enquiry from a neighbouring family. Colonel 
 Algernon pointed to the letters that lay before him 
 upon the table, and desired the Servant to ride over 
 with them immediately to the post-town. — He still

 ADELAIDE. 97 
 
 held in his hand the one he had just finished, and 
 giving it to the Man, he observed, that " that was a 
 letter of great consequence," and particularly charged 
 him to be sure that it was sent by that very evening's 
 post. 
 
 Having given these directions, the Colonel went to 
 Lord Altarnont's room, and as his servant knew he 
 was likely to remain there some time, he thought he 
 might as well finish his own carouse down stairs be- 
 fore he executed his errand. The mail, he was aware, 
 did not go out till very late in the evening, so he 
 left the despatches where they were for the present, — 
 placed the important one for more security between 
 the first pages of a Novel that happened to be upon 
 the table, and returned to his Companions in the 
 Servant's Hall. Before he set out upon his ride, the 
 strong ale had got so completely into his head, that 
 his recollection was confused ; he feared he was late, 
 and when he hastily snatched up the other letters, 
 he quite forgot every thing about that one which was, 
 in fact, the only object he need have remembered. 
 
 As the book into which he had put it, did not

 chance to be opened for a long while, the interesting 
 epistle remained undisturbed and unsuspected in its 
 hiding place. 
 
 Colonel Algernon waited with anxious impatience 
 for an answer from Sir George Fauconberg, which of 
 course could never arrive. At length he began to 
 imagine that his letter had not been received, and he 
 cross-questioned his Servant very strictly, to ascertain 
 if it had been faithfully put into the post. 
 
 The Man had no distinct remembrance upon the 
 subject ; he recalled a vague idea of some particular 
 charge having been given to him, — and he had a 
 geueral conviction that he had carried all the letters 
 entrusted to him, in time for the mail; — so he did 
 not hesitate most positively to declare that he had 
 done so. He perceived that his Master considered 
 his] having executed his commission accurately, as 
 a matter of serious importance, and he was artful 
 enough to give an air of greater truth to his affirma- 
 tions by hints he had taken from the questions Colo- 
 nel Algernon had just asked him. 
 
 " I am quite certain," said he, " I put that letter

 into the post. I carried several others, but I remem- 
 ber that one particularly, for two reasons ; — first, 
 because you told me it was upon business of great 
 consequence, and next, because I saw it was directed 
 to Sir George Fauconberg. I would not" (with a 
 smile) " have had it not go safe for a hundred pounds."

 letter was directed," replied Colonel Algernon, in a 
 tone that checked at once all further impertinence. 
 u What I desired you to tell me, was, if you had 
 obeyed my orders, and carried it to the post office." 
 
 " I assure you, Sir, I did ; it went by that night's 
 Mail." 
 
 Colonel Algernon, though vexed and angry with 
 the Man, could see no reason to doubt this assurance, 
 and his reflections upon the subject became very 
 uncomfortable. It seemed scarcely possible that so 
 warm-hearted a man as Sir George Fauconberg could 
 be unkind enough to take no notice of a letter written 
 under such distressing circumstances. He felt almost 
 inclined to write to him again, but his pride forbade 
 such a step. ' I have told him my story once,' thought

 he, ' and as he has not paid any attention to my com- 
 munication, I will not condescend, by repeating it, to 
 become a supplicant for his pity ! — Adelaide will, I 
 am sure, feel for me, if she has heard of my distress. 
 I shall not indeed see her at Fauconberg, but I trust 
 we shall meet in London, and if I then find her un- 
 changed, I shall very soon forget all the suspense and 
 anxiety I suffer at present.' 
 
 In spite of this philosophical reasoning, Colonel Al- 
 gernon felt very far from happy. Except a few days 
 spent in London, on regimental business, he remained 
 for nearly three months at Altamont Castle, and when 
 he left his Grandfather at the expiration of that pe- 
 riod, he had the satisfaction of knowing that his health 
 and strength were tolerably well re-established. 
 
 He found very few people in Town when he return- 
 ed there, and none who seemed likely to be able to 
 give him any information about the proceedings of 
 the Fauconberg Family. 
 
 One morning when Colonel Algernon was sitting 
 at the United Service Club, he was both pleased and 
 surprised to see Colonel Harcourt come in. They

 had been great friends abroad, but it was long since 
 they had met, and they had consequently much to 
 talk over. Colonel Harcourt, who belonged to a 
 Light Dragoon Regiment, was to set out for the north 
 the following day to rejoin it; and as Henry Alger- 
 non discovered that the Town in which it was quar- 
 tered was within a few miles of Fauconberg Manor, 
 he asked him if he had ever been staying at that 
 place ? 
 
 " I have dined there several times," replied he, 
 c< Sir George is a very hospitable, excellent man. 
 Lady Fauconberg has not the advantage of ranking 
 quite so highly in my estimation, and to confess the 
 truth, T suspect I never was a favorite of hers." 
 
 " How do you like Miss Fauconberg ? Has she 
 been fortunate enough to please you ?'' 
 
 " Oh the Young Lady," said Colonel Harcourt, 
 " is very pretty, very amiable, and very unaffected. 
 But what makes you so curious about the Fauconberg 
 Family, Henry ? Do you know them ?" 
 
 " I happened to see a good deal of them last 
 spring."

 Colonel Harcourt looked steadfastly at. his Friend, 
 and then exclaimed, " Oh aye, I understand it all 
 now. You happened to fall in love with the fair 
 Adelaide. Nothing could be more natural, — but I 
 hope it has not been a very serious affaire du cceur 
 with you, for I must warn you that rejjort says you 
 have a formidable Rival in her affections." 
 
 Henry Algernon felt as if a dagger had been 
 plunged into his breast ; he made, however, a violent 
 effort to conceal his emotion, and replied, with as much 
 apparent indifference as he could assume, — " There 
 is no occasion to alarm yourself upon my account. 
 My heart is not made of such tender materials as to 
 be easily broken. — I own I admired Miss Fauconberg 
 very much. I sometimes thought it might be no bad 
 speculation for a pennyless Soldier like me, to pay 
 my court in good earnest to a very pretty Heiress, — 
 Voila tout. As you tell me that her affections are 
 otherwise engaged, and as my little plan could conse- 
 quently only end in a Chateau eu Espagne, the sooner 
 I give it up the better." 
 
 " By no means ; why should you not go down

 with me to the north to-morrow, and fairly try your 
 fortune in the lists against your Rival ? I only spoke 
 from report, and you know the old proverb says 
 " that faint heart never won fair Lady." — Now if I 
 were a young Lady, and saw you kneeling on one 
 side of me, and Mr. Shirley kneeling on the other, I 
 should not hesitate a moment in making my election 
 in your favour." 
 
 " Mr. Shirley did you say ? Sir William Shirley's 
 Son. How long has he been returned to England ?" 
 enquired Colonel Algernon. 
 
 u I see you understand something of the Carte du 
 Pays. — I cannot tell you exactly the time of his arri- 
 val, for I was away when he came ; As I hear, he is 
 very constant in his attentions at Fauconberg Manor ; 
 the two Families live a great deal together, and it is 
 said that both are much pleased with the prospect of 
 a nearer union." 
 
 "And does Miss Fauconberg look very interesting, 
 and very — happy in the character of a Promise ?" 
 
 u Yes, she looks very much as most people do under 
 such circumstances."

 104 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " Well I wish her joy. And in spite of your 
 friendly advice, Mr. Shirley need be under no ap- 
 prehension of my ever attempting to cross his path." 
 
 u You know your own feelings Henry, better than 
 I can do, and I really believe your decision is a wise 
 one. But am I to understand that you are disinte- 
 rested enough to wish me to carry your congratula- 
 tions to Miss Fauconberg ?" 
 
 a No thank you. I can give them to her myself 
 the first time I meet her. — But, — " continued he, 
 suddenly starting up, " The pleasure of seeing you 
 Harcourt, has made me forget an appointment I 
 ought to have attended to an hour ago. Good bye, 
 good bye ; I must not positively stay here one instant 
 longer." And so saying, he rushed out of the room. 
 
 When the effort Colonel Algernon had made, was 
 over, and he found himself alone, the anguish of his 
 disappointment returned with redoubled force. The 
 hopes he had so long and fondly cherished seemed 
 destroyed for ever, The cause of the neglect with 
 which Sir George Fauconberg had treated him, was 
 too well explained, and his heart swelled with indig-

 nation at the supposed ill usage he had received. He 
 had, he thought, been encouraged, his hopes had 
 been flattered during the absence of the favored Ad- 
 mirer, — and then he had been unceremoniously dis- 
 carded the moment his presence might have proved 
 inconvenient ! — He felt that he had not deserved such 
 treatment, and he rejoiced that he had not committed 
 himself by making a formal and unavailing declara- 
 tion of his sentiments. 
 
 Could Adelaide herself have forgotten him as easily 
 as her Parents appeared to have wished her to do ? 
 He hoped she could not. — He would have given the 
 world could it have been possible for him to see her 
 alone, even for five minutes. — Yet Colonel Harcourt 
 had described her as consenting not only passively, 
 but happily, to the engagement that had been pro- 
 jected for her. 
 
 There was not one reflection that could afford him 
 any comfort, — not a single circumstance that could 
 soften the bitterness of his mortification. 
 
 Colonel Algernon soon heard the rumour of Miss 
 Fauconberg's approaching marriage repeated from

 so many quarters, that any doubts he might have en- 
 tertained upon its authenticity, were entirely removed, 
 and he determined to make up his mind to regret his 
 disappointment no longer. 
 
 But this wise resolution was more easily formed 
 than kept. He felt spiritless and unhinged, society 
 had lost its charm. He declined some engagements, 
 he scarcely knew why, and accepted others merely 
 because he was tired of living alone. Several people 
 predicted he was becoming too good, and every body 
 observed he had grown absent and melancholy. 
 
 Spring was now advancing, and it was with a feel- 
 ing of disgust that Colonel Algernon remarked the 
 appearance of increasing bustle and gaiety that Lon- 
 don presented. 
 
 He had been arranging his Books, and in so doing, 
 he put his hand accidentally upon the first Volume of 
 a Novel he had taken with him to Altamont Castle. 
 He had read it at that time, perhaps with greater 
 interest than it quite deserved, because he fancied 
 there was a strong resemblance between the cha- 
 racter of the Heroine and that of Miss Fauconberg ; —

 ADELAIDE. 107 
 
 and even now he could not resist the temptation of 
 looking back to one or two of the passages that had 
 particularly pleased him. 
 
 When he opened the book, a sealed paper fell out 
 of it ; he picked it up, and it is impossible to describe 
 his astonishment and dismay, when he discovered it to 
 be the unfortunate letter he had written to Sir George 
 Fauconberg so many months before. He examined 
 it minutely to be quite sure of its identity, — and then 
 striking his forehead, exclaimed in an agony of vexa- 
 tion, " Fool, worse than Fool that I have been !• — 
 I have thrown away my own happiness ! — I have un- 
 justly condemned others when nobody deserved to be 
 blamed but myself. — In spite of that Rascal's assu- 
 rance, I might have felt certain that my letter could 
 not have been received. How extraordinary my con- 
 duct must have appeared to Sir George and Lady 
 Fauconberg. — And Adelaide. — What must Adelaide 
 have thought of me ? — Despising me as deeply as she 
 must have done, I cannot blame her for having lis- 
 tened to the suit of one who was to all appearance a 
 far worthier and more faithful Admirer."

 He paced his room for several minutes with hasty 
 steps, then stopped, as if he had taken some sudden 
 resolution, and muttered ; — " It may not yet be too 
 late. At all events I will explain the truth, and 
 justify myself in the estimation of the whole Family." 
 
 He rang the bell violently, and his first act was to 
 inform his Servant of the discovery he had just made, 
 and to dismiss him from that very hour from his 
 service. 
 
 He next sallied forth to obtain a few days' leave of 
 absence ; returned to pack up his things ; and that 
 same evening he set out in the Mail for Colonel 
 Harcourt's Quarters in the north. 
 
 His arrival surprised his Friend extremely. 
 
 Thoughtless and light-hearted as Colonel Har- 
 court appeared, he had perceived that Miss Faucon- 
 berg's charms had made a much deeper impression 
 upon Henry Algernon than he chose to acknowledge ; 
 and he was much vexed with himself for the pain he 
 had unintentionally given him, by mentioning the 
 report of her approaching marriage. 
 
 When he returned to the Country he endeavoured

 ADELAIDE. 109 
 
 to ascertain if the report was really true, and from all 
 the information he could collect, it seemed to be so 
 well founded, that he considered Colonel Algernon's 
 case quite hopeless, and was very glad that he had 
 been judicious enough to think it so himself. 
 
 After the first greeting between the two young 
 Men was over, Henry Algernon at once opened his 
 mind to Colonel Harcourt. He confessed that during 
 their interview in London, he had attempted to de- 
 ceive him about his real sentiments for Miss Faucon- 
 berg ; and then related every circumstance connected 
 with his attachment to her, and his acquaintance with 
 her Family. 
 
 " And what," said Colonel Harcourt, who had 
 listened with deep interest to his communication, 
 ei do you intend to do ?" 
 
 u In the first place to ask your advice, for I believe 
 I am scarcely capable of directing myself. — But hap- 
 pen what may, I am resolved not to leave this neigh- 
 bourhood till I have given Sir George Fauconberg a 
 true and satisfactory explanation of my conduct." 
 
 " You are perfectly right," replied Colonel Har-

 court, " It is an act of justice you owe to yourself; 
 therefore I think we cannot do better than ride over 
 to Fauconberg Manor to-morrow morning at so early 
 an hour that we may be almost sure of finding Sir 
 George at home. 
 
 We must endeavour too to see Miss Fauconberg if 
 it is possible. — I do not wish to give you false hopes, 
 for I tell you fairly, that although her marriage has 
 not yet been declared, I imagine it is all settled. 
 Sir George would approve, Lady Fauconberg would 
 glory, and Sir William Shirley and his Daughters 
 would be delighted at such an event ; — And yet if 
 the young Lady herself could be induced to retract 
 her consent, and to set her face decidedly against it, 
 I should not even now despair of its being broken off. 
 One little circumstance, added to all you have just 
 told me, inclines me to believe that the fair Adelaide 
 would not look upon you with indifference. 
 
 The first time I dined with Sir George after my 
 return from Town, I took an opportunity of asking 
 Miss Fauconberg if she had not known you very well 
 in London ? She blushed blood-red, — replied that she

 had, — and enquired if I could tell her where you then 
 were ? I said you were in Town, that I had seen 
 you at the United Service Club the day before I came 
 into the Country, — and at this intelligence she grew 
 as pale as death. Her Mother, who always seems 
 watching every body who speaks to her, came up and 
 interrupted our conversation, which I had afterwards 
 no means of renewing ; but I remember that Miss 
 Fauconberg looked unusually grave all the rest of 
 the evening. 
 
 According to Colonel Harcourt's counsel, the two 
 Friends set out in good time the following morning 
 to call upon Sir George Fauconberg. They were 
 shewn into his Library where they found him writing; 
 the table before him was covered with papers, and 
 he did not seem to have expected the interruption of 
 Visitors so early in the day. Adelaide was seated at 
 a Bay Window at the end of the room, busily occu- 
 pied in sket:hing the form and branches of a fine old 
 Oak that formed a picturesque object upon the Lawn. 
 
 Both Father and Daughter looked up when the 
 door opened, and Miss Fauconberg's scarcely sup-

 pressed exclamation, — her look of joyful surprise, — 
 and the bright colour that overspread her whole coun- 
 tenance when she beheld Colonel Algernon, suffici- 
 ently proved that her heart at least, was unchanged. 
 Sir George's reception was far less encouraging. 
 After having shaken hands with Colonel Harcourt, 
 and made a stiff bow to his Companion, he stood as 
 if more than half inclined to take no further notice of 
 the latter. 
 
 Colonel Algernon came forward, and said, u I can- 
 not feel surprised Sir George at your looking coldly 
 upon me. — After the very kind invitation I received 
 from you before you left London, I am conscious that 
 my behaviour must have appeared very extraordi- 
 nary ; but I am come here for the express purpose of 
 explaining to you that I am not really so ungrateful 
 as I fear vou must have long: since believed me 
 to be." 
 
 He then drew from his pocket his own still un- 
 opened letter, — related when and under what circum- 
 stances it had been written, — confessed the mortifica- 
 tion he had felt at having received no answer, — and

 ADELAIDE. 113 
 
 described how and where he had discovered the ill- 
 fated Packet only two days before. 
 
 His explanation was so clearly and naturally given, 
 that it carried a perfect conviction of its accuracy to 
 the mind of him to whom it was addressed. 
 
 " This," replied Sir George, as he took the Letter, 
 " ought certainly to belong to me, but I shall not 
 read it now." — Then very cordially holding out his 
 hand to Colonel Algernon, he continued, — " We 
 have both been very foolish, both very much mis- 
 taken, and both very causelessly angry with each 
 other ; therefore I propose, as the wisest measure we 
 can now adopt, that we instantly pass an Act of Obli- 
 vion of these mutually imagined injuries. And to 
 ratify the Pacification, and make up as far as possible 
 for our past loss of your society, I hope we may be 
 able to persuade You and Colonel Harcourt to give 
 us the pleasure of your company at dinner to-mor- 
 row." 
 
 It is needless to say that this invitation was most 
 joyfully accepted by Henry Algernon. Colonel 
 Harcourt much regretted that a previous engage-

 ment must prevent his doing so likewise. While he 
 was expressing his vexation to the worthy Baronet, 
 Colonel Algernon advanced towards Adelaide, who 
 had been a deeply interested Auditor of all that had 
 passed, — and said to her in a low and agitated voice,— 
 " May I venture to hope Miss Fauconberg that I 
 have been happy enough to justify myself in your 
 estimation ? — That you, like Sir George, have for- 
 given me ?" 
 
 u You have certainly," replied Adelaide, a cleared 
 up a mystery that has for a long time puzzled us all. 
 But I do not know," added she with a smile, u how I 
 am to forgive an offence that never made me very 
 angry." 
 
 " Do you wish me to understand," continued Colo- 
 nel Algernon, in a tone of deep mortification, " that 
 my conduct has been perfectly indifferent to you ?" 
 
 " Oh no, no," exclaimed Adelaide, completely 
 thrown off her guard, " You have quite mistaken my 
 meaning. I intended to say that I always felt per- 
 suaded you must have some very good reason for 
 acting as you did, and that your silence only ap- 
 peared to be wrong because it was incomprehensible."

## p. 115 (#137) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 115 
 
 The expression of Colonel Algernon's countenance 
 changed in an instant. " Miss Fauconberg," cried he, 
 " I have suffered much since 1 saw you, but the kind- 
 ness of that speech has more than repaid me for 
 months of past anxiety and unhappiness." 
 
 Adelaide almost feared she had expressed herself 
 too strongly, yet she could scarcely find in her heart 
 to regret having spoken those words it had evidently 
 given Colonel Algernon so much pleasure to hear. 
 
 The conversation afterwards became general. Nei- 
 ther of the Guests felt particularly sorry when they 
 were informed that Lady Fauconberg was out walk- 
 ing ; what direction she had taken was uncertain, as 
 she had mentioned having more than one object in 
 view. 
 
 The vain hope of seeing her before their departure, 
 was however pleaded as an excuse for prolonging a 
 remarkably pleasant and gratifying visit to a very 
 unusual duration. 
 
 During their ride home, Colonel Algernon felt as 
 if all that had passed had been a dream, and he would 
 perhaps have preferred the uninterrupted indulgence

 of his own happy feelings, even to the conversation of 
 his warm-hearted Companion. 
 
 Colonel Harcourt was in wild spirits. He assured 
 Henry he had never heard so fine an Oration as the 
 one He had made that morning to Sir George Fau- 
 conberg. Congratulated him upon the brilliant effect 
 it had produced. Said he imagined that in point of 
 eloquence and success it could be equalled only by- 
 the tender little appeal he had afterwards whispered 
 to Miss Fauconberg's feelings. — Declared that if this 
 tide of prosperity and praise had not already carried 
 the Colonel's vanity to its greatest possible height, — 
 his head must inevitably be turned by the sort of 
 reception he might expect from Lady Fauconberg 
 the next day ; and lamented bitterly his own ill for- 
 tune in being unable to witness that joyful meeting. 
 
 " Adelaide/' said Sir George Fauconberg to his 
 Daughter, who stood gazing almost unconsciously at 
 the two Gentlemen as they rode away through the 
 Park, Ci My business has been greatly disturbed this 
 morning, — I shall not be able to finish it so soon as I 
 had expected ; yet I cannot regret an interruption

 ADELAIDE. 117 
 
 that has restored a valued Friend to my esteem. I 
 confess it has given me a more pleasing opinion of 
 human nature, to discover that I was not deceived in 
 my original estimate of this Young Man's character ; 
 and it affords also a lesson, never to condemn any one 
 without first hearing his own defence," 
 
 Adelaide's heart was too full to allow her to say 
 'much. Her Father perceived this, and kindly con- 
 tinued, " You had better go out while it is fine, my 
 Love, I shall not now have time to ride with you to- 
 day. We will take a long round together to-morrow, 
 when I shall be more at leisure." 
 
 Miss Fauconberg obeyed the hint Sir George had 
 given. The fresh air soon calmed her excited spirits, 
 her confused ideas began to assume a more connected 
 train, and her joyful agitation subsided into a feeling 
 of quiet and unruffled happiness. 
 
 When Lady Fauconberg returned from her walk, 
 she was surprised to find Sir George still in the Li- 
 brary, and yet more astonished when he gave her a 
 detailed account of Colonel Algernon's visit. 
 
 She at first attempted to represent his Story as

 altogether extremely improbable, and then to invali- 
 date the accuracy of its different parts, — but finding 
 she could not succeed in making any impression upon 
 her Husband, she determined to endeavour to conceal 
 her vexation as well as she could. To Sir George, 
 she did not dare to mention the influence she was too 
 well aware this dreaded e'claircissement would have, 
 in crushing Mr. Shirley's hopes ; but she secretly 
 determined to do every thing in her power to coun- 
 teract, if possible, its effect.

 We must now return to the Party we formerly 
 left assembled at Fauconberg Manor. 
 
 Mr. Shirley's toilette was distracted by the most 
 agonizing reflections. He had at length discovered 
 that those affections he would have given the universe 
 to gain, had been previously engaged. His favored 
 Rival was, except in fortune, — in every respect at 
 least his equal, and appeared to stand very high in 
 Sir George's estimation. That Lady Fauconberg 
 was his own Ally, and had always been a firm well- 
 wisher to his cause, he did not entertain a doubt ; yet 
 his bosom swelled with rage and indignation when 
 he considered how much she had deceived him, — 
 how eagerly she had encouraged hopes she must

 have been aware were not likely to be realized 
 felt very angry with his Sisters too. It was impos- 
 sible they should not have been aware of the mutual 
 attachment that had existed between Colonel Alger- 
 non and Adelaide ; Why had they concealed from him 
 
 so important and interesting a circumstance ? 
 
 What appeared still more incomprehensible, why had 
 not the happy Admirer himself come forward sooner 
 to carry off the Prize from all other Competitors ? 
 
 Mr. Shirley had however little time for considera- 
 tion ; he hurried down stairs, and when he entered 
 the drawing-room he found that one only of the party 
 had come there before him. This person was Mr. 
 Fretwell, an active, busy, little old Man, who had 
 passed the greater part of his life in a small Borough 
 Town not very distant from Fauconberg and Grey- 
 field. Having had nothing better to do, he had taken 
 much pains to make himself acquainted with the 
 affairs of his Neighbours, — he could boast a perfect 
 knowledge of the Party Politics, and petty intrigues 
 of his townsmen, by most of whom he was looked up 
 to as a sort of Leader and Oracle ; — And possessing 
 
 He

 an ample share of vanity, he was much impressed 
 with an idea of his own weight and importance. 
 
 During the time of a General Election, Mr. Fret- 
 well was in his glory. In former days Oldthorpe had 
 always quietly sent one Whig and one Tory Mem- 
 ber to Parliament, but in consequence of the extinc- 
 tion of an ancient and powerful Family, the Tory 
 interest had latterly much declined ; vigorous at- 
 tempts had been made to bring in two Whig Candi- 
 dates, and several very sharp contests had taken place. 
 Upon these occasions Mr. Fretwell's support and as- 
 sistance were considered of great consequence, both 
 from his influence with the Electors and his acquaint- 
 ance with their characters and interests. He had 
 been courted by all parties, and though he disclaimed 
 taking any decided part in the public politics of his 
 Country, he had always favored the Whig Members 
 during the Elections at Oldthorpe. He delighted in 
 the bustle of a contest, and often observed with ex- 
 ultation that t the Candidate He wished for, was pretty 
 sure of success.' 
 
 The moment Sir William Shirley's Son returned to

 122 ADELAIDE. 
 
 England, Mr. Fretwell fixed his eye upon him as a 
 very proper person to represent Oldthorpe after the 
 next dissolution of parliament. And when he subse- 
 quently heard him spoken of as a young" Man of very 
 superior abilities, he thought he should do credit to 
 himself by being instrumental in bringing' him for- 
 ward. He accordingly made some overtures of friend- 
 ship and assistance to Sir William, who received them 
 rather coldly ; and the little Man was so offended with 
 his ingratitude, that he determined never again to 
 volunteer his aid to any body who was not likely to 
 appreciate its value. 
 
 Had his proffers been addressed to the Son instead 
 of the Father, it is probable they would have been 
 treated with much more attention. Mr. Shirley wish- 
 ed to be in Parliament, and the hints Mr. Fretwell 
 had given, induced him to take the interests of Old- 
 thorpe into his consideration. The present Whig 
 Member was pretty sure of being" returned again, 
 but it did not seem improbable that he might success- 
 fully oppose any other Candidate ; and he was de- 
 sirous to make the attempt. As a preliminary to such

 ADELAIDE. 123 
 
 a step, he perceived it was absolutely necessary to 
 conciliate Mr. Fretwell, and obtain his advice and 
 support, — and how this was to be accomplished, he 
 did not exactly know ? 
 
 Lady Fauconberg, with whom he had talked over 
 this matter, and who entered warmly into his views, — 
 occasionally saw Mr. Fretwell, and she undertook to 
 become the Mediatrix between them. She extolled 
 Mr. Shirley's talents, — lamented they should be lost 
 to the public, — hinted that he was only deterred from 
 intending" to present himself at Oldthorpe, by an idea 
 that he should not meet with support from any of the 
 leading People, — mentioned the terms of high respect 
 in which she had always heard him speak of Mr. 
 Fretwell, — and artfully insinuated how much Sir 
 William regretted his own folly in not having pro- 
 fited by advantages that were once most kindly held 
 out to him. 
 
 When Lady Fauconberg thought she had suffi- 
 ciently flattered the little Man's vanity, and worked 
 him round to favour her purpose, she put the finishing' 
 stroke, as she imagined, — to her negociation, by per-

 suading Sir George, with whom he was no great 
 favorite, to invite him to dinner to meet Mr. Shirley. 
 
 To conclude this long but necessary digression ; — 
 When Mr. Shirley found himself tete a tete with 
 Mr. Fretwell in the drawing-room at Fauconberg, it 
 seemed to him as if all the world had that day con- 
 spired to torment him. At any other time such an 
 interview would have delighted him, but in the pre- 
 sent state of his mind, he felt it impossible to fix his 
 attention upon electioneering interests. While he 
 endeavoured, therefore, to treat Mr. Fretwell with 
 marked civility and deference, he determined to put 
 off his intended discussion till a future opportunity. 
 
 The little Man smiled very graciously upon him. 
 Waited impatiently for the communication Lady 
 Fauconberg had led him to expect. Looked im- 
 portant. Wondered Mr. Shirley did not mention 
 Oldthorpe. Fidgetted about. Took up the news- 
 paper, and laid it down again. Imagined his Com- 
 panion's evident embarrassment arose from diffidence ; 
 and charitably resolved to give him encouragement 
 by opening the subject himself, which he was con- 
 vinced was alone engrossing his thoughts.

 Accordingly when Mr. Shirley enquired if there 
 was any news in the paper he had just been affecting 
 to read, he replied, — a Nothing very particular. — 
 I see indeed that a Dissolution is much talked of, and 
 that is a topic upon which I fancy we feel a mutual 
 wish to have some conversation." 
 
 Mr. Shirley perceived that if he now declined this 
 friendly challenge, he should inevitably forfeit Mr. 
 Fretwell's good graces for ever. Secretly wishing 
 Him, Oldthorpe, and every body belonging to it, at 
 
 the d 1, — he therefore prepared to state his own 
 
 plans as distinctly as he could, and to express that he 
 should ground his hopes of success entirely upon Mr. 
 Fretwell's kind counsel and co-operation. 
 
 " I wish you had consulted me sooner," replied his 
 Auditor. "These affairs require long preparation, 
 and an early start is an immense advantage. We 
 must see however what can yet be done for you. — 
 I understand Sir William now approves of your views. 
 You are aware that I am not a sort of person to en- 
 courage a Son in any pursuit that has not been sanc- 
 tioned by his Father."

 Mr. Shirley little liked the tone of this enquiry, 
 yet he hastened to satisfy Mr. Fretwell's scruples, 
 and even to assure him that Sir William had long 
 wished that the cordiality which formerly existed 
 between him and the Family at Greyfield, might be 
 restored. 
 
 " And so in sooth it shall be," cried the little Man, 
 holding out his hand with a beaming smile, — " For- 
 give and Forget, is my motto. — I promise you my 
 hearty good wishes and assistance at Oldthorpe when- 
 ever you may require them." 
 
 While Mr. Shirley was endeavouring to express 
 suitable gratitude and delight at so much kindness, 
 his Tormentor dragged him to a window, and began 
 a discussion upon the complicated concerns and inte- 
 rests of " The Borough" (as he called it,) which 
 seemed never likely to come to a conclusion. He 
 was so wrapped up in his subject, — so impressed with 
 its importance, and with the value of the information 
 he was imparting, that he was not aware Lady Fau- 
 conberg and nearly all her Guests had come into the 
 room.

 Mr. Shirley contrived to conceal his impatience, 
 and to affect to be listening 1 with great attention to 
 Mr. Fretwell's edifying discourse, until Adelaide 
 made her appearance. He had never seen her look 
 half so beautiful ; there was an expression of anima- 
 tion and happiness in her countenance he had upon 
 no former occasion observed it assume, — and he fan- 
 cied that even her dress was more studied and more 
 becoming than usual. The smile with which she 
 turned to speak to Colonel Algernon, who had seated 
 himself beside her, completed the measure of Mr. 
 Shirley's torture ; he entirely lost all self-command, 
 and beinsf unable longer to endure his ffood Friend's 
 prosing details, — he turned abruptly from him, ex- 
 claiming, " You must excuse me, Mr. Fretwell. — 
 I feel a sudden giddiness " 
 
 The wildness of his look and manner, astonished 
 and alarmed the little Man considerably. 
 
 " I fear you are very ill, Sir," said he. " Will you 
 not take something ? — Had you not better send for 
 medical advice :" 
 
 u By no means, I shall soon be quite well ; and in

 the mean time may I request you not to mention the 
 subject of my health to any one." 
 
 Mr. Fretwell was silenced. ' This is very strange/ 
 thought he to himself ; and he could not help appre- 
 hending that his future Member for Oldthorpe had 
 been seized with a sudden fit of insanity. 
 
 The announcement of dinner prevented Mr. Shir- 
 ley's emotion from having been remarked by the rest 
 of the Company. Lady Fauconberg's keen eye had 
 been directed towards him from time to time, and 
 after Colonel Algernon had offered his arm to her 
 Daughter, she called him by name to conduct her to 
 the dining-room. Mr. Shirley felt little inclination 
 to obey the summons, and he absolutely started at 
 her Ladyship's assurance when she observed that 
 c she was afraid he was not well. 
 
 u I have a head ache," replied he. " I believe I 
 may thank that odious Mr. Fretwell for it ; he has 
 been boring me to death for the last hour with illus- 
 trations of the Politics of Oldthorpe, and pompous 
 insinuations of his own consequence. He is far the 
 most insufferable Idiot I ever met with."

 * And yet," observed Lady Fauconberg, " it is 
 worth while to endure his folly for the sake of his 
 utility." 
 
 " Passive endurance never was a leading feature in 
 my character," said Mr. Shirley very drily; and all v 
 the insinuating endeavours of his Neighbour, did not 
 succeed in restoring his good humour during the 
 whole time of dinner. 
 
 Adelaide, who was seated between her Father and 
 Colonel Algernon, was too agreably engaged in con- 
 versation with the latter, to think of Mr. Shirley, or 
 to observe what was going forward at the other end 
 of the table. Other people did not fail to remark 
 that the Stranger's arrival seemed likely to derange 
 their Neighbour's matrimonial plans, and great was 
 the astonishment this circumstance occasioned. 
 
 The Ladies retired early, and as soon as they found 
 themselves in the Drawing-Room, Mrs. Cooper said to 
 her hostess, " I presume I may still venture to con- 
 gratulate you, Lady Fauconberg, upon your Daugh- 
 ter's approaching marriage ; though I confess that 
 until I came here to-day, 1 imagined Mr. Shirley was

 130 ADELAIDE. 
 
 to have been the happy man, instead of Colonel 
 Algernon ." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg concealed her vexation, and 
 answered with a smiling countenance, — " I am very 
 much obliged to you for your kind congratulations, 
 my dear Mrs. Cooper, but to own the truth they are 
 rather premature, for Adelaide is not at present en- 
 gaged to be married to any body." 
 
 Mrs. Cooper made many apologies for the indis- 
 cretion of which she had been guilty. 
 
 " Oh pray do not distress yourself about it," replied 
 Lady Fauconberg. u You are not the first person 
 who has heard reports and has believed them. Wil- 
 liam Shirley lives so much with us that I am not 
 astonished at its being thought He is to marry Ade- 
 laide. — I am a little surprised at your having supposed 
 there could be any thing serious in a flirtation with 
 Colonel Algernon." 
 
 The evening passed much as such evenings usually 
 do in a Country House. There was conversation, 
 music, a whist table for the elders, and a round game 
 for the younger part of the company.

## p. 131 (#153) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 131 
 
 Before he joined the Ladies, Mr. Shirley had re- 
 covered his self-possession. He went up to Miss 
 Fauconberg, and found so much to tell her that it was 
 impossible for any one else to attempt to speak to 
 her. But although he thus contrived to keep his 
 Rival at a distance, his advantage afforded mortifi- 
 cation rather than pleasure to himself. Adelaide's 
 manner was perfectly civil, but his conversation was 
 evidently uninteresting to her; she listened to his 
 brilliant descriptions with an air of absence and indif- 
 ference very unlike the gratifying attention with 
 which she had listened to Colonel Algernon's re- 
 marks at dinner. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg managed to prolong this disa- 
 greable tete a tete by asking the Miss Coopers to 
 sing, — and having once established them at the piano- 
 forte, she appeared to be so delighted with their per- 
 formance that she would not allow them to leave it. 
 
 u Does not Miss Fauconberg sing ?" enquired Colo- 
 nel Algernon. 
 
 U Yes," replied Lady Fauconberg, " but I can 
 hear Adelaide every evening. It is very seldom I 
 have the pleasure of hearing the Miss Coopers." 
 
 i 2

 " You are very kind," said Miss Cooper, * but 
 really my Sister and I must not deprive ourselves and 
 every body else of the gratification of listening to Miss 
 Fauconberg. Do pray Colonel Algernon go and beg 
 her to come and sing to us." 
 
 The Colonel did not wait for a second command, 
 he instantly approached Adelaide, and thus addressed 
 her, — 
 
 " Miss Fauconberg, I am commissioned by the 
 company at the other end of the room, to request you 
 will have the goodness to come and take a part in 
 the Concert." 
 
 Adelaide rose, as she answered in the same playful 
 tone, " I shall be most happy to obey the flattering 
 wishes of the Company." 
 
 " And she might have added, to get rid of my im- 
 portunate society," muttered Mr. Shirley to himself, 
 as he watched her walk away with his Rival. 
 
 Adelaide had naturally a very pretty voice, and 
 having had the advantage of the best possible instruc- 
 tion, she sung extremely well. As her Mother had 
 always accustomed her to exert her talents in that

 ADELAIDE. 133 
 
 way when there was company at Fauconberg, she felt 
 no timidity when she was called upon to do so, — and 
 she was too good natured and unaffected ever to make 
 a difficulty about singing to any person who might 
 express a desire to hear her. Upon this occasion, 
 however, her usual confidence seemed to have for- 
 saken her, her voice trembled, and during her first 
 song Colonel Algernon certainly experienced a feel- 
 ing of disappointment. 
 
 u Adelaide is not in good voice to-night," observed 
 Lady Fauconberg as she left the Piano-Forte. 
 
 "Do you sing any of these ?" asked Colonel Alger- 
 non, while he turned over the leaves of a Book filled 
 with Italian Songs. 
 
 66 I have sung them all, sometimes," — answered 
 Miss Fauconberg, u I will now try any one of them 
 you happen to like best." 
 
 The air he selected chanced to be a particular fa- 
 vorite of her own ; she had got the better of the 
 nervous sensation that had before embarrassed her ; 
 and her second song was performed with a clearness 
 and brilliancy of execution that surprised even Lady

 Fauconberg, and perfectly delighted Colonel Al- 
 gernon. 
 
 " Charming, charming '." exclaimed he. " What 
 a beautiful voice ! — How I wish you would sing that 
 song over again ! I could listen to it for ever !" 
 
 " I rather suspect that you sing yourself," said 
 Adelaide. 
 
 " If any body had taken the trouble of teaching 
 me, I do not know what I might have done. As it 
 is, I do not understand a note of music." 
 
 " But you can sing a second to this, I dare say," 
 continued she, pointing to a popular Duet. 
 
 " Perhaps I could manage to do so, — but I assure 
 you I would much rather hear you sing alone." 
 
 He allowed himself, however, to be persuaded to 
 make the attempt. He was, as he declared, perfectly 
 ignorant of the science of music, but having a fine 
 voice and a good ear, he performed his part very suc- 
 cessfully. Adelaide had many other Duets; but 
 Lady Fauconberg, who was not at all pleased with 
 the turn the evening had taken, suddenly put an end 
 to the Music by proposing a Pool at Commerce.

 Soon after breakfast the following morning, the 
 Party at Fauconberg began to disperse. The Cooper 
 Family proceeded on their Journey South, — Others 
 took their leave of their Host and Hostess, and Mr. 
 Shirley, who had kept his Horses waiting for some 
 time at the door as if he was determined to out-stay 
 Colonel Algernon, at last rode away with Mr. Fret- 
 well. 
 
 The Colonel still lingered with the hope of finding 
 an opportunity of having a few moments private con- 
 versation with Adelaide, but as Lady Fauconberg 
 never left her Daughter's side, even He was at length 
 obliged to take his departure. 
 
 When he rose to go away, Sir George expressed 
 much regret that the Annual Meeting of a Book So- 
 ciety, which was to take place that morning, and to 
 conclude with a Dinner, prevented his endeavouring 
 to detain him another day at Fauconberg. 
 
 " How much longer," enquired he, a do you pro- 
 pose to remain in this Country ?" 
 
 " I am obliged to return to Town to-morrow even- 
 ing," replied Colonel Algernon. " I came away at

 136 ADELAIDE. 
 
 such short notice that I could not expect, indeed I 
 did not ask for a more extended leave of absence at 
 present." 
 
 " Well, I am truly glad," concluded the Baronet, 
 as he shook him cordially by the hand, — <6 that we 
 have seen you here ; and I have much pleasure in 
 thinking that we shall all very soon meet again in 
 London." 
 
 Adelaide said nothing, but Colonel Algernon fan- 
 cied that her looks expressed a great deal. 
 
 It was evident that Lady Fauconberg could not en- 
 dure him, yet as he strongly suspected he had made 
 a happy impression upon her Daughter's heart, — and 
 as he believed he should be supported by Sir George's 
 good will and approbation, — he was willing to natter 
 himself that his hopes would be speedily crowned 
 with success.

 As soon as Sir George was fairly gone to his Meet- 
 ing, Lady Fauconberg observed to her Daughter that 
 she intended to drive over to Greyfield after luncheon. 
 
 " To day, Mama?" said Adelaide. 
 
 " Yes," replied her Ladyship. " Have you any 
 objection to such a plan ?" 
 
 " No, I am sure I can have none." 
 
 Yet somehow it did so happen that Greyfield was 
 the last place Adelaide would at that moment have 
 wished to go to. 
 
 A pause ensued, which was at length broken by 
 Lady Fauconberg. " Adelaide," said she, " I can-

 not say that I was quite satisfied with your conduct 
 yesterday." 
 
 Miss Fauconberg started, but instantly replied, — 
 " I am extremely sorry that I have displeased you, 
 Mama, but indeed till this moment I was not aware 
 of having done so." 
 
 " I think you will not deny that you knew it was 
 wrong- to torment a Person who is seriously attach- 
 ed to you. You must have perceived that you gave 
 William Shirley great pain by flirting so much with 
 Colonel Algernon." 
 
 " I had no intention," answered Adelaide, "of griev- 
 ing Mr. Shirley, and I thought so little about him 
 yesterday that I never observed he was vexed. I own 
 I have frequently suspected that I was not quite in- 
 different to him, but I have always endeavoured to 
 make him understand that it was impossible I could 
 return his preference. Had I therefore guessed that 
 he disapproved of my talking to — any body else, I 
 should not, upon his account, have imagined it ne- 
 cessary to discontinue doing so." 
 
 " This is language Miss Fauconberg, which I do

 ADELAIDE. 139 
 
 not understand, and which I have not been accustom- 
 ed to hear from you. You would not have ventured to 
 have spoken to me in this way, three days ago." 
 
 " My dear Mama/' replied Adelaide, who began 
 to feel quite bewildered, u if I have said any thing 
 disrespectful, I very humbly entreat you to forgive 
 me." 
 
 " I am very willing to do so," said Lady Faucon- 
 berg, " but to prevent any of these unpleasant dis- 
 cussions in future, let us first comprehend each other 
 more plainly. — Considering the footing upon which 
 William Shirley has for some months been received 
 in this family, I wish you to tell me what you meant 
 just now by saying that it was impossible for you to 
 return his preference ?" 
 
 " I fear you will be angry with me," answered 
 Adelaide timidly, " for I can only repeat, that I meant 
 just what my words expressed. — Excepting that he 
 came here much oftener, I did not know that Mr. 
 Shirley was received upon a different footing from 
 any body else." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg looked much displeased, as she

 140 ADELAIDE. 
 
 continued, " These evasions will avail you little, they 
 only oblige me to be more explicit, — to state, — what 
 I should not have supposed it necessary to declare to 
 you in such direct terms ; that your Father and I have 
 for some time regarded William Shirley as our future 
 Son-in-law.'' 
 
 Adelaide grew very pale, as she exclaimed, — " I 
 had no idea of this. If I had imagined that you and 
 Papa had entertained any serious intention of my 
 forming such an Engagement, I should much sooner 
 have implored you to take pity upon me, and to think 
 no more of a plan that would destroy my happiness 
 for life." 
 
 " You have indeed unfortunately made this disco- 
 very rather too late. For, as we have encouraged 
 William Shirley's hopes, we are now bound in honour 
 to use all our influence with you to prevent their be- 
 ing disappointed." 
 
 Adelaide burst into tears, and clasping her hands, 
 " Oh Mama," cried she, " you surely cannot intend 
 to compel me to become the Wife of a Man I can 
 never love !"

## p. 141 (#163) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 141 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was softened by her Daughter's 
 distress, and she felt almost inclined to give up the 
 selfish and cruel scheme she had formed; but the next 
 moment her pride and obstinacy overcame her better 
 feelings. 
 
 u Adelaide," said she in a much kinder tone, " It 
 hurts me to see you distress yourself ill this way. — 
 You must know that neither your Father nor I, much 
 as we may have wished you should accept William 
 Shirley's intended proposal, would ever think of obli- 
 ging you to marry any body contrary to your own 
 inclination ; and were we even disposed to do so, I 
 cannot imagine that poor William himself would de- 
 sire to obtain your hand upon such terms." 
 
 Then as if speaking to herself, she continued, — 
 " Though Parents are not justified in urging their 
 children to contract alliances that are displeasing to 
 them, they certainly have a right to direct their 
 choice. The first interest of their lives is to see them 
 happy, and as they are far better qualified to judge 
 who will be likely to render them so, than they can 
 be themselves, they are deficient in their duty if they

 142 ADELAIDE. 
 
 do not refuse their consent to any connection they 
 have reason to consider decidedly disadvantageous to 
 their welfare ." 
 
 Addressing herself more directly to her Daughter, 
 — she said, 6C I have perhaps expressed myself more 
 strongly than I intended, for I confess that my disap- 
 pointment is a very severe one. I had always indulged 
 a wish that I might some day see you united to Wil- 
 liam Shirley. During his long absence abroad, this 
 hope was much weakened, — but great was my joy on 
 perceiving after his return, the first indications of that 
 attachment for you which he has since confided to me. 
 My imagination anticipated the future, — I fancied 
 you securing your own happiness by promoting that 
 of an amiable and talented young Man, the Son of 
 your father's oldest Friend and nearest Neighbour. — ■ 
 I felt sure you would become as much the pride and 
 delight of all his family as you have hitherto deser- 
 vedly been of your own Parents. — But all these bright 
 visions have been destroyed, just when they appeared 
 upon the eve of being realized! I am too well aware 
 of the cause of this grievous mortification. It does

 ADELAIDE. 143 
 
 not arise from any objection you can make to Wil- 
 liam Shirley himself, — for in character, situation in 
 the world, fortune, age, manners, he is perfectly un- 
 exceptionable. It is simply because you now ima- 
 gine yourself in love with Colonel Algernon, that you 
 fancy it is impossible you should ever like any body 
 else, — and in the true spirit of romance, that you de- 
 sire to throw away the substance, for the shadow of 
 happiness." 
 
 During the whole of this artful appeal to her feel- 
 ings, Adelaide had covered her face with her hands, 
 but the tears trickled through her fingers. At length 
 she raised her head, and with the air of a person who 
 after a struggle has taken a decided resolution, — she 
 said, 
 
 " Mama, I cannot marry Mr. Shirley, — but I am 
 anxious to prove my obedience in any other way 
 you will point out. I will cheerfully submit to what- 
 ever you may dictate, — even should you require me 
 to sacrifice the dearest wishes of my own heart." 
 
 This was exactly the point towards which Lady 
 Fauconberg had been working. She saw her advan-

 144 ADELAIDE. 
 
 tage and she was ungenerous enough instantly to seize 
 it. In short she obtained with the greatest ease, a so- 
 lemn promise from her Daughter, that she would 
 never listen to any proposal from Colonel Algernon 
 without having previously received an unsolicited per- 
 mission from her Father and herself to do so. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg had succeeded in removing one 
 obstacle from her path, — her great anxiety was now 
 to conceal from her Husband the step she had taken. 
 She told Adelaide she would lose no time in explain- 
 ing to Sir George the extreme reluctance she felt to 
 fulfil the engagement that had been projected for her. 
 She undertook to persuade him, in compliance with 
 her wishes, to allow her to decline it. And also to 
 request him to break to Mr. Shirley as delicately and 
 speedily as possible, the disappointment that awaited 
 him. 
 
 When Adelaide said it was her intention to express 
 to her father how deeply it grieved her to act what she 
 feared must appear a very undutiful part ; Lady Fau- 
 conberg observed, it would be far better to leave the 
 business entirely to her management. u I admire,''

 ADELAIDE. 145 
 
 continued she, " the feeling that prompts you to wish 
 to express your sorrow for what has passed, — but as 
 an explanation of this kind between a Father and 
 Daughter, would bring on the discussion of many 
 topics very painful to both, — of circumstances con- 
 nected with Colonel Algernon, unpleasant to You, — 
 it is much more desirable to avoid, than to seek it. 
 You must have observed that Sir George has never 
 mentioned to you in direct terms, the subject of Wil- 
 liam Shirley's attachment. I have little doubt I can 
 prevail upon him to make no allusion to it in future, 
 therefore you need not feel any further uneasiness 
 upon that account. And now, my dear Adelaide, 
 our mutual compliances are fairly balanced. I have 
 engaged for your Father and myself that we will 
 relinquish our cherished scheme for your establish- 
 ment in life, because its completion would have proved 
 disagreable to you ; — and, you have in return promised 
 to give up your own little Romance because it did not 
 meet with our approbation. Let the past be forgotten 
 and forgiven between us, and let us live happily and 
 comfortably together, as we have always hitherto 
 done."

 146 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Poor Adelaide was deeply affected by her Mother's 
 supposed kindness, and she firmly resolved to do every 
 thing in her power to endeavour to deserve it ; but 
 she found it no easy task to recover her usual com- 
 posure. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg and her Daughter had not con- 
 cluded their Luncheon, when a Servant came in to 
 announce that the carriage was at the door. 
 
 " The carriage," exclaimed her Ladyship, " Oh, I 
 quite forgot to send word to the Coachman that I should 
 not want it this morning." Then as the man was leav- 
 ing the room, she called him back, — " As the car- 
 riage is out, it may as well wait ; I may perhaps take 
 a drive after all." 
 
 As soon as the door was closed, she said to Ade- 
 laide, — " It has just occurred to me that there are 
 circumstances which now make it very important to 
 William Shirley that I should see him before the de- 
 parture of to-morrow's post ; I will therefore go over 
 to Greyfield, and try to find an opportunity of pre- 
 paring him for the communication he may so soon 
 expect to receive from Sir George. Of course I do 
 not propose to You to accompany me upon such an

 errand ; and I dare say after the agitation you have 
 experienced, you will not be very sorry to be left for 
 an hour or two alone. As I am so ready immediately 
 to perform my part of our engagement, let me see 
 you look cheerful and contented when I return ." 
 
 Adelaide was at first much surprised when she 
 heard of her Mother's intention ; she felt very grate- 
 ful to her, however, for the promptitude with which 
 she was about to undeceive Mr. Shirley, — and any 
 circumstance that could remove her own apprehen- 
 sion of a further persecution from him, was an inex- 
 pressible relief to her mind. 
 
 The transition from unexpected happiness to sor- 
 row and hopeless disappointment had been so sudden 
 that she felt almost stupified, and was not yet able to 
 comprehend her own sensations or to understand the 
 exact position in which she was placed. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's reflections during her drive, 
 were far from agreable. Her conscience reproached 
 her severely for the cruelty of her conduct towards 
 her Daughter : — She could not help fearing that, in 
 spite of all her precautions, Sir George would disco- 
 ver the deceit she had practised; — And even if she 
 
 k2

 148 ADELAIDE. 
 
 should escape the shame of being detected, there were 
 still so many impediments to be overcome, that it 
 seemed very doubtful if her schemes would after all 
 prove successful. 
 
 When she arrived at Greyfield she was told that the 
 young Ladies were not at home; she was much 
 vexed — but while she was giving a message for them 
 to the Servant, — -just " to her wish, beyond her hope," 
 Mr. Shirley rode up to the door. He had been at 
 Oldthorpe, where, with Mr. Fretwell's assistance, his 
 affairs had been placed in a very hopeful train ; and 
 the satisfaction he felt at the promising success of his 
 first visit to that Town in the avowed character of a 
 future Candidate, had in some measure blunted the 
 poignancy of the mortification he had experienced at 
 Fauconherg. 
 
 Mr. Shirley started at seeing Lady Fauconberg, 
 and his glance towards her carriage was succeeded by 
 a look of disappointment, when he discovered that she 
 was alone. She expressed so much regret at missing 
 his Sisters, who were reported to be gone out walk- 
 ing, that he could not do less than ask her to accom- 
 pany him into the house and await their return. The

 invitation was readily accepted, and he led the way to 
 a Drawing-Room that opened into the Garden. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg did not lose a moment in useless 
 preamble, but came at once to her point, by saying, 
 " that as she was well aware he thought he had cause 
 to be angry with her, she was extremely desirous to 
 give him an explanation that would immediately re- 
 move that impression from his mind.'" 
 
 " Since you have mentioned this subject," replied 
 Mr. Shirley haughtily, u You oblige me to tell you 
 that I consider myself very ill used. You encouraged 
 my attentions to your Daughter. You deceived me 
 into a belief that I should be accepted by Miss Fau- 
 conberg, although you must have known that her 
 affections were otherwise engaged. Had you kindly 
 informed me of this circumstance when I first ex- 
 pressed to you my admiration for her, you would have 
 spared me the bitter disappointment I suffered yes- 
 terday. — But that is now past, — However severe the 
 struggle may have been, — it is over !" 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was not daunted by this declara- 
 tion. 
 
 " Had I behaved to you in the treacherous

 manner you imagine," continued she calmly, " I 
 should deserve the severity of your censure. — I believe 
 the best and easiest justification of my conduct, will 
 be a short detail of the principal facts connected with 
 our accpiaintance with Colonel Algernon ; And when 
 you have heard these, you will I am sure have the 
 candour to confess that you have wronged me. — Colo- 
 nel Algernon was introduced to us last year in Lon- 
 don, and I soon observed that he paid Adelaide much 
 attention : I did not like him, and I felt relieved to 
 think that we should lose si^ht of him when we re- 
 turned to the Country. Sir George, who found him 
 an agreable young Man, and considered nothing fur- 
 ther, asked him to come down to Fauconberg ; the 
 invitation was accepted with avidity, but time passed 
 and we neither saw him or heard any thing of him. 
 I concluded that I had been mistaken in the idea I 
 had formed of his views, or what would have been 
 equally satisfactory to me, that he was volage and 
 had fallen in love elsewhere. I know Adelaide's 
 opinion coincided exactly with mine, and I had long 
 supposed she had entirely forgotten him, when he 
 started up like an Apparition three days ago, and

 ADELAIDE. 151 
 
 appeared amongst us to trouble our peace. As an 
 excuse for his past oblivion, he imposed an impro- 
 bable Story upon Sir George about a Letter that had 
 never arrived, — because it had most likely never been 
 written. I think he suspected that he had not duped 
 me by his flimsy inventions, and he shall soon learn 
 that I have the power to crush any hopes he may 
 have founded upon the favour of others." 
 
 Mr. Shirley was perfectly acquainted with the cha- 
 racter of his Companion, he knew her to be capable of 
 any artifice or misrepresentation, yet the account she 
 had just given him bore the stamp of truth, — it was 
 corroborated too by circumstances, — and he had no 
 hesitation in believing it; he even condescended to 
 apologize to Lady Fauconberg for the personal injus- 
 tice he had clone her. " After all," concluded he, 
 " I may in a great measure blame myself for the 
 pain I have suffered ; I was aware from the first that 
 Miss Fauconberg could never be brought to endure 
 me." 
 
 " Adelaide, with all her superiority," replied Lady 
 Fauconberg, u is not entirely exempt from the weak- 
 ness, perhaps I ought to say the vanity, of a very

 young Girl. Colonel Algernon was the first person 
 who had admired her. — She was flattered, she was 
 pleased by his preference, and she fancied she liked 
 him in return. His visit has now unfortunately re- 
 vived this silly, long* forgotten fancy in her mind. — 
 All this she has confessed to me since his departure ; 
 I have told her that with all his talents, Colonel Al- 
 gernon is a person I could never approve as a Son-in- 
 Law, and she has faithfully promised me that she will 
 think of him no more." 
 
 Mr. Shirley turned away his head, it would have 
 been difficult to decide if disgust at the conduct of the 
 Mother, or admiration for that of the Daughter, at 
 that moment predominated in his mind. Lady Fau- 
 conberg imagined his movement was occasioned by 
 a pang of jealousy, and thus continued her discourse. 
 
 " If after all you have just heard, you can still feel 
 desirous of rivalling Colonel Algernon, I will venture 
 confidently to assure you that your perseverance will 
 not in the end prove unavailing." 
 
 "And do you suppose," replied Mr. Shirley, indig- 
 nantly, " I can wish to obtain Miss Fauconberg's 
 hand when you have yourself informed me that her 
 heart has been long bestowed upon another ?"

## p. 153 (#175) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 153 
 
 a I can only answer that question by asking you in 
 return if you imagine me barbarous enough to com- 
 pel my Daughter to concede the one to any body to 
 whom I believe it impossible she could give the other 
 also. — While her foolish preference for Colonel Al- 
 gernon remained dormant, there was a sort of mystery 
 attached to his conduct that prevented its being en- 
 tirely extinguished. His appearance it is true has 
 revived it, but since romance and hope have ended 
 together, depend upon it the fancy will very soon die 
 away in her mind." 
 
 A silence of some minutes ensued. Mr. Shirley 
 heartily despised Lady Fauconberg, and his proud 
 spirit revolted at the idea of accepting her proffered 
 assistance. Yet he loved Adelaide to distraction, — 
 he had just experienced the agony of supposing that 
 she was lost to him for ever, — and the hope now held 
 out to him, that through the kind offices of her Mo- 
 ther, she might still be his, — was a temptation he had 
 no power to withstand. His first impulse was gene- 
 rally a right and amiable one, but being unsupported 
 by any steady principle, too often yielded to the sug- 
 gestions of interest; In the present case his selfish 
 feelings overcame every other consideration. His

 whole mind had long been bent upon persuading Miss 
 Fauconberg to accept him as her future Husband, and 
 in his endeavours to promote this object, he did not 
 scruple to employ any means but such as the world 
 would have regarded dishonorable and ungentleman- 
 like. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg perceived the impression she had 
 made, even before Mr. Shirley acknowledged to her 
 that * the hope of ever being happy enough to be 
 approved by Adelaide, would be still the dearest aim 
 of his ambition.' — She counselled him to come less 
 frequently to Fauconberg for some little time, than 
 he had lately been in the habit of doing ; — this, she 
 said, would prevent Adelaide's entertaining any suspi- 
 cion of his having been instrumental in influencing 
 her parents against Colonel Algernon ; — and also have 
 the effect of piquing her vanity. — She added, that she 
 should wish the difference in his conduct to her 
 Daughter to be perceptible to her Family alone, since 
 it was highly desirable that the world in general, and 
 more particularly Colonel Algernon, should suppose, 
 as they had hitherto done, that an engagement actu- 
 ally existed between them. — She even ventured to

 ADELAIDE. 155 
 
 advise him to conceal from his Father and his Sisters 
 the mortification he had experienced, — and hinted 
 that J ulia had observed enough of the former flirta- 
 tion in London, to be particularly quick-sighted upon 
 the subject of its renewal. As a contradiction to any 
 surmises that might have been formed by the party 
 the day before, she proposed to take Emily back with 
 her to Fauconberg. She then artfully turned the 
 conversation to Oldthorpe, where she imagined that 
 every thing had been going on prosperously. Mr. 
 Shirley felt that he owed much of his success to Lady 
 Fauconberg's advice and management ; and before 
 his Sisters came in from their walk, she had contrived 
 to talk him into a good humour with herself, and a 
 persuasion that his matrimonial prospects might yet 
 be as hopeful as his electioneering ones. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg assured the Miss Shirley's that 
 Adelaide had been extremely anxious to come with 
 her to Greyfield, but as she had caught a bad cold out 
 riding the day before, she had positively insisted upon 
 her staying at home to take care of it. 
 
 " I much wish, my dear Emily,'' continued her 
 Ladyship, '* that I could persuade your Father to

 156 ADELAIDE. 
 
 allow You to return with me ! It would be such a de- 
 lightful surprise to poor Adelaide, and I owe her some 
 consolation for her disappointment. Do you think Sir 
 William would give his consent to my running away 
 with you ?" 
 
 Some of the Guests who had been assembled at 
 Greyfield were not yet gone, but Mr. Shirley warmly 
 seconded Lady Fauconberg's proposal, and took upon 
 himself to answer for his Father's approbation of 
 Emily's departure. In short the plan was sj^eedily 
 arranged, and Miss Shirley's preparations were soon 
 made. 
 
 " It is really very good and charitable of you," 
 said Lady Fauconberg, as she rang the bell to order 
 her carriage, u to leave your own Visitors to come 
 and sit with Adelaide and me. We have no Beaux 
 to entertain you at Fauconberg, even Sir George 
 dines out to-day. — Bye the way, who do you think 
 dined with us yesterday ? Your old friend Colonel 
 Algernon, Julia!" 
 
 " Colonel Algernon !" — exclaimed both Sisters with 
 evident surprise and dismay. Julia's quick glance 
 wandered towards her Brother, but his countenance

 ADELAIDE. 157 
 
 was turned away from her, — lie seemed looking in- 
 tently at some object out of the window. She soon 
 recovered her self-possession, and enquired * if the 
 Colonel was still in the north ?' 
 
 " He goes to Town to-morrow I believe/' replied 
 Lady Fauconberg. " He has been staying with 
 Colonel Harcourt; they were great allies it seems 
 when they were in Spain." 
 
 Julia did not venture to ask any more questions, 
 and the announcement of Lady Fauconberg's carriage 
 put an end to the conversation. As soon as he had 
 handed the two Ladies into it, Mr Shirley walked 
 away in the direction of the Stable, where he said he 
 had some orders to give. Julia lingered a minute or 
 two upon the steps before the door, muttering to her- 
 self the following broken sentences. 
 
 u So Colonel Algernon has been at Fauconberg ! — 
 Adelaide is reported to have a bad cold. — Emily is 
 the Companion selected to cheer her under this indis- 
 position in preference to me, because I might be more 
 likely to discover the cause that occasioned it. — All 
 this bodes no good to poor William, — alas, alas ! I 
 wonder if he is aware of the disappointment that 
 hangs over him ?"

 158 ADELAIDE. 
 
 During the whole of the evening Julia watched 
 her Brother narrowly, but she could discover nothing 
 from his manner. He had a long discussion with Sir 
 William apart from the rest of the company, yet she 
 could catch enough of it to ascertain that they were 
 only talking about the affairs of Oldthorpe, — a sub- 
 ject extremely uninteresting to her. At length she 
 summoned assurance to ask William 6 if he had ever 
 met Colonel Algernon before, and what he thought of 
 him ?' His answer instead of satisfying her curiosity, 
 only puzzled her still more. He said very coolly, that 
 the Colonel had been a perfect stranger to him till he 
 had seen him at Fauconberg, — that he had not had 
 much conversation with him there, but he thought he 
 appeared to be considered very agreable, and that 
 he almost fancied himself acquainted with him from 
 having known his cousin, Horace Algernon in Italy. 
 " But bye the way," observed he, looking suddenly 
 at his sister, " from a hint Lady Fauconberg gave 
 this morning, I suspect You have some time or other 
 felt a peculiar interest in the Hero we are speak- 
 
 ing of. ; 
 
 Julia assured him with great truth that he was

 completely mistaken in this conjecture. She suppres- 
 sed the quick retort which started involuntarily to her 
 lips; and neither She nor her Brother felt inclined 
 to touch again upon a topic that for different reasons 
 of their own they were mutually afraid of.

 As soon as her Mother left her, Adelaide shut her- 
 self up in her own little Sitting-Room; she drew a 
 chair near the fire, and remained for a long time 
 vacantly gazing upon the expiring embers within the 
 grate, almost as motionless as a Statue. At length she 
 felt the necessity of rousing herself from the sort of 
 reverie into which she had fallen ; she walked to the 
 window, and thinking that the fresh air would relieve 
 her head ache, she went out to her garden. Every 
 thing there had lost its usual interest, she scarcely ob- 
 served the flow r ers that bloomed around her, while her 
 eye involuntarily wandered over the line of country

 she had traversed in returning from her ride the day 
 before, — and rested upon every point in the distance 
 that had been remarked or admired by Colonel Al- 
 gernon. — She did not however allow herself to dwell 
 very long upon recollections which the promise she 
 had made to her Mother, seemed to forbid her to 
 indulge. With this feeling a full consciousness of 
 the painful sacrifice she had consented to, rushed at 
 once upon her mind, and she burst into a violent flood 
 of tears. 
 
 Before Lady Fauconberg returned from her drive, 
 Adelaide had regained sufficient self-command to 
 meet her with a smiling countenance ; but her pale 
 cheeks and swelled eyes betrayed the anguish she had 
 suffered, and even Miss Shirley instantly perceived 
 she had been weeping ; she observed too that there 
 appeared more than an usual degree of kindness and 
 attention in her Mother's manner towards her. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg followed her Daughter to her 
 room before dinner. 
 
 " You did not, I have no doubt," said she, <6 ex- 
 pect to see Emily Shirley come back with me

 to-day. I thought it right to ask her to do 
 so, in order to prove to the world that although the 
 projected alliance between our Families is broken off, 
 that circumstance will occasion no alteration in our 
 friendship. — I found poor William alone when I 
 arrived at Greyfield, and was therefore enabled to 
 communicate to him the result of my conversation 
 with you. The manner in which he bore his disap- 
 pointment, was beyond all praise. I need not describe 
 to you the violence of his distress, but I cannot help 
 mentioning that your happiness was evidently much 
 dearer to him than his own. And that he declared no 
 consideration should ever induce him to consent to pur- 
 chase the one at the expense of the other. He said 
 we must forgive him if he came but seldom to Fau- 
 conberg, since it would be extremely painful to him 
 to visit us until time had accustomed him to view his 
 altered prospects with more indifference than he could 
 pretend to command at present. — But we shall be 
 late," concluded her Ladyship, as if interrupting her- 
 self. a I said when I came up stairs, that we should 
 be ready for dinner in a quarter of an hour; Emily

 will wonder what can be become of us ? — Of course I 
 entered into no explanation this morning with her 
 and Julia, therefore I was obliged to tell them you 
 had a bad cold as an excuse for your not having ac- 
 companied me to Greyfield." 
 
 During the evening Adelaide found Miss Shirley's 
 presence a great relief. Under existing circumstances, 
 a third person removed the embarrassment she would 
 have felt in a tete a tete with her Mother. The con- 
 versation turned upon general subjects, the Ladies 
 insensibly resumed their usual occupations, and before 
 they parted at night, they were perfectly at ease with 
 each other. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg sat up till Sir George's return 
 under a pretence of curiosity to hear what had passed 
 at the Book Society, but in reality to be able to give 
 her own account of her visit to Greyfield, and of the 
 various circumstances connected with it. When Sir 
 George heard that Miss Shirley had come back with 
 her, he observed, ' He should always be happy to see 
 Emily under his roof, but he much wished that She 
 and all the Shirley Family should understand that

 Adelaide could never be more nearly connected with 
 them than she was at present ; — since the occurrences 
 of the last two days had shown that the idea of an 
 Union between her and Mr. Shirley was now quite 
 out of the question.' 
 
 Lady Fauconberg replied c that nobody could have 
 perceived that fact more clearly than she had done, 
 and that she was pretty sure it had been equally evi- 
 dent to William Shirley.' 
 
 u Poor William !'' continued she, " I pity him with 
 all my heart ! You well know what have been my wishes 
 and my sentiments upon this subject, — but as I am now 
 convinced that the accomplishment of my favourite plan 
 is incompatible with our dear Adelaide's happiness, 1 
 cannot longer feel one moment's hesitation in relin- 
 quishing it. — Adelaide is well aware that the Object 
 of her preference has always found favour in your 
 sight, — she has just witnessed the kind reception you 
 have given him here, and as her spirits have of course 
 been much agitated by what has passed, I should 
 strongly recommend you not to mention Colonel Al- 
 gernon's name either directly or indirectly to her.

 These things are always best left to take their own 
 natural course. We shall soon meet the Colonel in 
 London, and he will probably lose no time in declar- 
 ing his attachment.'* 
 
 Sir George was both surprised and delighted with 
 the apparent liberality of Lady Fauconberg's conduct, 
 and he promised implicitly to follow the hints she had 
 thrown out. The warm praise he bestowed upon her 
 generosity of mind and disinterested kindness towards 
 her Daughter, was the keenest punishment he could 
 have inflicted upon her duplicity ; she felt how richly 
 she had deserved it, and she writhed beneath it. 
 
 For the first time in her life, Adelaide was afraid to 
 see her Father. The worthy Baronet attributed her 
 violent agitation when they met, to feelings very dif- 
 ferent from its true cause, and startled her considerably 
 by enquiring very kindly about her cold, and telling 
 her to take care of herself and get rid of it before her 
 journey. 
 
 Miss Shirley remained for some days at Faucon- 
 berg ; during that period the two young Ladies were 
 of course constantly together, Sir George consequently

 166 ADELAIDE. 
 
 saw less of his Daughter than he would have done had 
 they been alone, and had little opportunity of remark- 
 ing the dejection of spirit which she was not able 
 always entirely to conceal. 
 
 As the time of their departure approached, Ade- 
 laide felt every clay more and more unwilling to 
 move. She now dreaded, as much as she had formerly 
 wished to meet Colonel Algernon. And in her pre- 
 sent state of mind, her heart sickened at the very idea 
 of the Balls and Parties she had so much enjoyed the 
 year before. She would have given the world to have 
 been allowed to remain quietly where she was, but she 
 had no choice. 
 
 She had had abundant leisure to meditate upon 
 every syllable of her conversation with her Mother, 
 and as she retraced it calmly in her recollection, the 
 retrospect was far from affording her comfort. Many 
 little circumstances that had almost escaped her ob- 
 servation in the agitation of the moment, returned 
 very forcibly to her memory, and threw a new light 
 upon the view she had at first taken of the past. — Her 
 Father's behaviour too had surprised her not a little,

## p. 167 (#189) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 167 
 
 In his manner towards her she had never perceived 
 the slightest indication of a consciousness of what had 
 transpired between her and Lady Fauconberg, and 
 she was often tempted to think that he knew nothing 
 about it. It was agony to her to suppose it possible 
 that her Mother could in any respect have deceived 
 her, and she rejected such a fancy as if it had been a 
 crime ; but still in spite of all her efforts to banish it, 
 it would frequently present itself to her imagination. 
 She could not bring herself to believe that her Father 
 had ever formally encouraged Mr. Shirley's preten- 
 sions. If he had shown an inclination to sanction the 
 hopes of any Admirer, she had reason to suspect that 
 that Admirer was Colonel Algernon. This persua- 
 sion gave rise to many bitter regrets, and she was 
 haunted with a thousand doubts and fears for the 
 future. 
 
 Distressed and perplexed as she was, Adelaide felt 
 that the promise she had given was sacred and binding ; 
 but she determined that should Mr. Shirley attempt to 
 renew his attentions, she would instantly declare her 
 sentiments upon the subject to Sir George, and re-

 quest him to allow her to explain them also to Mr. 
 Shirley himself. He called once at Fauconberg before 
 the departure of the Family, and his manner towards 
 her was so cold, so distant, and so different from what 
 it used to be, that she afterwards entertained no doubt 
 of Lady Fauconberg's having faithfully performed 
 that part of her engagement which related to him. 
 
 Immediately after Colonel Algernon returned from 
 the North, he went to spend a week at Altamont 
 Castle. He found his Grandfather's health and strength 
 considerably improved, but he looked much broken, 
 and his illness had still left him infirm. Henry en- 
 deavoured to persuade him to remove for a short time 
 to London, but without success, for he declared that he 
 was as comfortable, and much more his own master 
 in his present abode in the country, than he could 
 possibly be any where else, and he was consequently 
 determined not to leave it. 
 
 The old Peer's reception of Colonel Algernon had 
 been most affectionate, he was delighted to have him 
 again with him, and one evening when he was talking to 
 him of his future prospects, Henry revealed to him

 ADELAIDE. 169 
 
 his attachment to Miss Fauconberg. Lord Altamont 
 caught at the idea, and was so much pleased with the 
 description he received of Adelaide, that he told his 
 Grandson, ' if he should succeed in obtaining her affec- 
 tion, He would take care that no pecuniary difficulties 
 should obstruct their Union.' In short he seemed de- 
 sirous by his kindness in promoting Henry's happiness, 
 to make amends for the unrelenting harshness of his 
 conduct towards his Father. 
 
 Colonel Algernon contrived to ascertain the exact 
 moment the Fauconberg Family were expected in 
 London, and he called upon them the very morning 
 after their arrival; but Lady Fauconberg had so suc- 
 cessfully tutored her Servants, that he was told they 
 were not at home. 
 
 The next time he presented himself at their door, 
 he received the same information, and had he not 
 found Sir George's card upon his own table, he would 
 have been strongly inclined to imagine that the ex- 
 clusion had been intentional. 
 
 The first time he met Adelaide was at a large 
 Evening Party : she was sitting beside her Mother

 170 ADELAIDE. 
 
 among a group of Ladies, — he perceived her as he 
 entered the room, and instantly made his way towards 
 her. He thought she looked thin and ill, and the de- 
 light he had felt at seeing her, was chilled at once by 
 the reception she gave him. Instead of the unaffect- 
 ed cordiality, — the flattering smile of pleasure with 
 which she had greeted him on his last appearance at 
 Fauconberg, — her manner was now singularly distant, 
 reserved, and embarrassed. She grew very pale, and 
 seemed scarcely to understand the observations Colo- 
 nel Algernon addressed to her. His astonishment 
 and mortification were extreme. Lady Fauconberg 
 made no attempt to relieve the awkwardness of either 
 Adelaide's or his situation, — And the interview was 
 evidently so painful to both, that after having endured 
 his distress for a few moments, he walked away, 
 threaded back his path to the door, and darted out 
 of the house. 
 
 Adelaide felt as if she could breathe more freely 
 when Colonel Algernon was gone, but she was griev- 
 ed to the heart at the pangs it was too visible she had 
 inflicted, and deeply distressed by the consciousness

 ADELAIDE. 171 
 
 of having appeared ungrateful, capricious, and con- 
 temptible in the eyes of the Person whose good opi- 
 nion she most wished to possess. A sort of faintness 
 came over her. — She told her Mother she did not feel 
 quite well, and requested to be allowed to go home. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg instantly complied with this pro- 
 posal, she said something about the heat of the room, 
 and asked a Young Man who was standing near her, 
 to have the goodness to call her carriage. 
 
 There was one Individual who had watched the 
 scene which has just been described with the deepest 
 interest. This was Mr. Shirley; — He had not at- 
 tempted to speak to either of the Ladies that even- 
 ing, but he had observed them attentively from the 
 moment of their arrival, and while he experienced a 
 malicious sort of satisfaction in the mortification and 
 discomfiture of Colonel Algernon, he obtained also a 
 certainty of Lady Fauconberg's having acted up to 
 her professions, and been a true Friend to his Cause. 
 
 As She and her Daughter passed near him in leav- 
 ing the room, he turned his head in an opposite direc- 
 tion, but not until he had exchanged a significant

 172 ADELATDE. 
 
 glance with the former, which the latter was too much 
 occupied with her own thoughts, to remark. 
 
 When Miss Fauconberg found herself alone, no 
 tears came to her relief, she passed a sleepless night, 
 and when she rose in the morning she was feverish 
 and really ill. 
 
 Sir George was much alarmed, ' he declared she 
 should not go again into hot rooms, — that he had not 
 liked her looks for some time, — And that if she was 
 not much better in a day or two, he should not rest 
 satisfied with the advice of the Apothecary, but should 
 call in the aid of a Physician.' 
 
 Lady Fauconberg herself felt very far from com- 
 fortable about her Daughter, — She had not antici- 
 pated her being so seriously affected : yet she endea- 
 voured to tranquillize Sir George's apprehensions, 
 while she approved the contingent expediency of the 
 measure he had suggested ; for she observed, c that 
 Adelaide's cold had certainly hung a great while upon 
 her.' 
 
 The Apothecary was sent for, he looked grave and 
 important, prescribed Fever Draughts, and ordered

 his Patient not to leave her room. He called again in 
 the evening, and declared her pulse was improved. 
 Indeed so great was the efficacy of his remedies, that 
 when he came to see her the next morning, he pro- 
 nounced her decidedly convalescent, and recommended 
 her to go out in the carnage and take an airing. 
 
 After his interview with Miss Fauconberg, Colonel 
 Algernon reached home in a state of extreme depres- 
 sion ; He threw himself into a chair and endeavoured 
 in vain to account for the extraordinary change that 
 had manifested itself in Adelaide's behaviour towards 
 him. Had her sentiments remained unaltered, he 
 fancied she could never have been barbarous enough 
 to treat him as she had done. Yet he thought she 
 appeared unhappy, it was therefore impossible for 
 him to feel any indignation against her. By degrees 
 he began to suppose she might have acted under the 
 influence of some powerful obligation ; and also to flat- 
 ter himself, in contradiction to her own inclination. 
 Her conduct, he imagined, might be found to accord 
 perfectly well with such a supposition. — Could she 
 have been prevailed upon by her Mother, — for he did

 not suspect Sir George of taking part in such a pro- 
 ceeding ; to give her consent to a marriage with Mr. 
 Shirley ? And had such an Engagement imposed 
 upon her an imperious necessity of extinguishing as 
 quickly and decidedly as possible, his own hopes of 
 obtaining her hand ? — This, he almost confessed to 
 himself, formed the most probable solution of the 
 mystery. But he was unwilling to give it entire cre- 
 dence, and he determined to seek an opportunity of 
 obtaining a more satisfactory explanation from Ade- 
 laide's own lips. 
 
 To call upon Lady Fauconberg again was out of 
 the question, but Colonel Algernon was agreably sur- 
 prised a few days afterwards, by receiving an invita- 
 tion to dinner from Sir George. When the Baronet 
 proposed to her to send this, his Lady did not dare to 
 make any objection to his doing so. She flattered 
 herself, that after what had passed, the invitation 
 would be declined, but in this hope she found herself 
 deceived, for an answer of acceptance was returned. 
 
 Air and exercise had been recommended for Ade- 
 laide, and there was nothing she enjoyed so much as

 her daily rides with her Father. Their excursions 
 had, by her own desire, — been hitherto chiefly con- 
 fined to the Lanes in the environs of London, with 
 which she had been previously little acquainted, — but 
 the afternoon preceding- the day that had been fixed 
 for their dinner party, Sir George proposed to his 
 Companion that they should go into the Park and look 
 at the world, adding i that if they never shewed them- 
 selves in public he was afraid their Friends would 
 forget them.' 
 
 Adelaide immediately assented to her Father's pro- 
 posal. The first Person who overtook them in their 
 Ride was Mr. Shirley, — he shook hands with Sir 
 George, bowed to Miss Fauconberg, and passed on. 
 A few moments afterwards, they met Colonel Alger- 
 non : the greeting he received from Sir George was 
 so frank, so hearty, and so kind, that although Ade- 
 laide's manner was as reserved as it had been before, 
 he turned his Horse's head and joined them. The 
 conversation was at first carried on almost entirely 
 between the two Gentlemen, but as Colonel Algernon 
 was determined to try to lead Miss Fauconberg to

 join in it, he addressed himself to her, and remarked 
 that ' he had not had the pleasure of meeting her any 
 where during the last ten days.' 
 
 She replied, that c with the exception of her rides, 
 she had not gone out.' 
 
 " Adelaide," said Sir George, " has been a great 
 Invalid lately. She went to one Assembly soon after 
 we arrived in Town, and was so much the worse the 
 next day for having done so, that I have been obliged 
 to interdict hot rooms ever since. — She contrived to 
 catch a bad cold," continued the Baronet, " the very 
 morning you left Fauconberg, and she has not yet 
 been able to get rid of it." 
 
 Colonel Algernon looked towards Adelaide while 
 her Father was speaking. She had before been very 
 pale, but the blood now rushed to her face, and she 
 became crimson to the very brow : As she turned 
 aside to conceal her confusion, he fancied he saw her 
 brush away a tear. His curiosity and interest were 
 powerfully excited, and he felt more desirous than 
 ever to ascertain the real state of her sentiments. 
 
 Sir George and his Daughter were recognized and

 ADELAIDE. 177 
 
 accosted by many of their acquaintance as they passed 
 backwards and forwards. At length an old Friend of 
 the Baronet's whom he had not seen for some years 
 rode up to them, the meeting gave great satisfaction 
 to both, they had much to talk over, and were soon 
 very deeply engaged in conversation. 
 
 This chance seemed to offer Colonel Algernon the 
 opportunity he had so ardently wished for, of speak- 
 ing to Adelaide in private, and he did not lose a 
 moment in taking advantage of it. He suddenly 
 called her attention to a Group of people at some dis- 
 tance, — She could not help turning to observe them, 
 and when he had thus induced her to linger a little 
 space behind her Father, he said to her in a low and 
 agitated voice, — 
 
 a Miss Fauconberg, from the mortifying alteration 
 in your manner, I cannot help fearing that I must 
 have been unhappy enough to have given you some 
 offence." 
 
 Adelaide started violently, and seemed much dis- 
 tressed, while she answered, i It is You who have 
 cause to be offended. I have no hesitation in con-

 178 ADELAIDE. 
 
 fessing that you have never given me the slightest 
 reason for offence." 
 
 Colonel Algernon bent forward in an attitude of 
 the deepest attention, as if he expected she would 
 have said more, but as she remained silent, — he thus 
 continued, 
 
 w I am aware you will think me dreadfully imper- 
 tinent, but I can no longer endure the agony of 
 suspense I have suffered since I met you the other 
 evening. Will you permit me to ask you one ques- 
 tion ? The future happiness of my life depends en- 
 tirely upon your answer. Should it be such as I most 
 dread to receive, I have made up my mind to submit 
 to my fate in silence. You may rest assured that you 
 will never hear another word of persecution from 
 me." — He paused, — " Miss Fauconberg, are you en- 
 gaged to be married ?" 
 
 Adelaide was evidently very much surprised, but 
 she immediately replied, — 
 
 u No, indeed I am not. — You have been again 
 mistaken." 
 
 As she uttered these words a gleam of indescribable

 ADELAIDE. 179 
 
 delight illuminated Colonel Algernon's whole coun- 
 tenance. 
 
 64 Thank God!" exclaimed he, "Thank God. You 
 cannot imagine what a horrible weight that assurance 
 has removed from my heart." 
 
 Adelaide gazed at him for a moment. The happi- 
 ness he had so warmly expressed, and that still ani- 
 mated every feature, was most agonizing to her ; — 
 Yet she felt extremely unwilling to deprive him of it. 
 The necessity however of speedily undeceiving him 
 was urgent, and making a great effort to command 
 her feelings, she said, — 
 
 " Colonel Algernon, I have told you that I am not 
 at present engaged to be married. I must also tell 
 you that I have given a solemn promise to a Person 
 who had a right to demand it from me, which will 
 most likely prevent my ever being so." 
 
 She turned away her head, for she could not bear 
 to see the fearful change which her last communica- 
 tion had instantaneously wrought upon his whole ap- 
 pearance ; — but she continued to speak to him. 
 " You are, I am sure, too generous to press me further 
 
 m 2

 180 ADELAIDE. 
 
 upon this painful subject, — And I am persuaded you are 
 equally incapable of wishing to advise me to act in 
 opposition to my duty to a Parent." 
 
 W You do me justice," replied Colonel Algernon, 
 who seemed still completely stunned by the disap- 
 pointment he had experienced. ' 
 
 " I shall be happier," proceeded Adelaide, " Now 
 that I have had this opportunity of explaining to you 
 my conduct. It grieved me deeply to think how 
 capricious, unworthy, and contemptible I must have 
 appeared to you, I hope I have reinstated myself in 
 your good opinion, — And it will be a great satisfac- 
 tion to me to believe that you will always consider me 
 as a Friend. We must both endeavour to forget the 
 past, — And, Oh Colonel Algernon let me implore you 
 never to allow any recollection of me to interfere with 
 the plans, or to cloud the happiness of your future life." 
 
 Strange as it may appear, Colonel Algernon felt 
 hurt, he mistook the composure with which she had 
 spoken for indifference, and he answered ' that it was 
 easy to recommend forgetfulness, but he feared he 
 should find it a very difficult task to practise it."

## p. 181 (#203) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 181 
 
 This was too much ! — the spirit that had hitherto 
 supported Adelaide gave way, and the tears rolled 
 rapidly down her cheeks, as she observed, t that per- 
 haps he was not the only person who had felt that 
 forgetfulness was in some cases both painful and im- 
 possible.' 
 
 Colonel Algernon was stung almost to madness by 
 discovering the cruel injustice of which he had been 
 guilty. He implored Adelaide to forgive him, though 
 he declared he could never forgive himself. He be- 
 sought her to pity, — to make allowance for him, since 
 his mind was in such a state of distraction that he 
 scarcely knew what he said, or what he did. — Then 
 breaking off into a sort of soliloquy, he lamented the 
 evil fortune that seemed constantly to pursue him, and 
 tinally exclaimed, u It is very strange ! — I am not 
 superstitious, yet from that fatal hour a blight has ap- 
 peared to hang over all my hopes and prospects." 
 
 The wildness of his looks, and his incoherent ex- 
 pressions began to alarm Adelaide. 
 
 " It frightens me," said she, u to hear you talk in 
 that strange way. For My sake, as well as for your

 182 ADELAIDE. 
 
 own I entreat you to compose yourself. I have given 
 you the strongest possible proof of the reliance I feel 
 in your discretion as well as in your honour, by the 
 undisguised disclosure I have just made to you. 
 Do not let me have the cruel mortification of finding" 
 that my trust and confidence have been misplaced. 
 That I have done wrong in imparting to you a secret 
 that perhaps ought never to have passed my lips." 
 
 Colonel Algernon's outward agitation was imme- 
 diately tranquillized by this touching appeal, but 
 Adelaide's kind exertions to soothe, and reconcile him 
 to his disappointment, only increased his internal dis- 
 tress. Sir George and his Friend stopped as if they 
 were about to separate. 
 
 " Colonel Algernon," cried Miss Fauconberg, " I 
 have one favour to request of You. It is that you will 
 not let my Father discover or suspect from your man- 
 ner towards him, either now or hereafter, — what has 
 been the nature of our conversation to-day. Much, 
 if not the whole of what I have told you, is I believe 
 unknown to him. I have never before concealed any 
 thing from him, — it is very painful to me to be obli-

 ADELAIDE. 183 
 
 ged to do so, — but indeed he must not learn this from 
 Afe, or through any means of mine." 
 
 Colonel Algernon had just time to assure her that 
 her wishes should be most carefully obeyed, before 
 the Baronet turned round, and observed, c he had 
 been talking over days long past till he almost fancied 
 himself young again.' " But Adelaide," exclaimed 
 he, with a sudden start of alarm, " what is the matter 
 with you my dearest Child ?" 
 
 Miss Fauconberg was much distressed to find that 
 her looks betrayed so strongly the agitation she had 
 suffered, — she stammered something about her being 
 tired, and said ' she thought they had been out rather 
 longer than usual.' 
 
 Sir George did not seem to be quite satisfied with 
 this explanation; he looked towards Colonel Algernon, 
 but the Colonel's bridle had got out of its place, and 
 he was at that moment bending over his horse's neck 
 
 to arrange it. 
 
 " The best thing I can do with you," said Sir George 
 in a tone that went to his Daughter's heart, u is to 
 take you home. Do you feel very ill ?"

## p. 184 (#206) ############################################


 
 H84 ADELAIDE. 
 
 u Oh no, no. A sort of faintness came over me 
 just now, but it is quite gone I assure you." 
 
 " It was the same kind of attack then that you had 
 at the Party the other Evening ?" 
 
 " I do not know exactly what it was," answered 
 Adelaide, with some hesitation. The bright colour 
 had again mounted to her cheeks, and she continued, 
 u I feel already so much better, that I am quite 
 ashamed of having been so silly, and I am still more 
 vexed with myself for the unnecessary alarm I have 
 given you, my dear Papa.'' 
 
 " Say nothing about that," replied Sir George very 
 kindly, " it was foolish of me to be frightened. I 
 might have remembered that as you have been ill 
 lately, it is very natural you should not yet be strong. 
 Colonel Algernon looks very much as if he thought 
 the sin of having assisted in fatiguing you during 
 the last half hour, rested upon his head ; but my dear 
 Colonel if blame attaches to any one, it is to me, for 
 it is I who have kept out my Daughter too long. — I 
 trust very little mischief has been done, and that 
 uhcn we have the pleasure of seeing you at dinner

 to-morrow, you will find that Adelaide has not expe- 
 rienced any permanently bad effects either from your 
 conversation or from her ride." 
 
 Neither of the Parties to whom this speech was 
 addressed, ventured to look at each other during the 
 short time they afterwards remained together. 
 
 Colonel Algernon fancied, hut perhaps it was only 
 fancy, — that Sir George's manner when he took leave 
 of him, was not quite so cordial as it had been when 
 they met. — He ventured to press Adelaide's hand, 
 and as he almost inarticulately whispered a God bless 
 you, Miss Fauconberg ! " he felt that a tear had fallen 
 upon his own.

 When Adelaide arrived at home, Lady Faucon- 
 berg's quick eye discovered that something must have 
 occurred to agitate her violently, even before Sir 
 George told her "he hoped he had not killed his 
 Daughter, but that he saw the necessity of taking 
 better care of her another time, for she had been 
 dreadfully fatigued with the length of her ride." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg asked Adelaide no questions, she 
 merely observed that a dish of tea would revive her if 
 she was tired ; led her up stairs, and drawing the

 curtains across her windows, desired her to lie down 
 upon the Sofa and rest herself till dinner. 
 
 Her Ladyship then rejoined her Husband in the 
 Drawing-Room, and had no difficulty in obtaining 
 from him a minute account of his ride and of every 
 circumstance he knew of, connected with it. — From 
 the superior information She possessed upon many 
 points relating 1 to Colonel Algernon, she was enabled 
 to guess that some explanation had taken place 
 between him and Adelaide, and she determined to act 
 at once upon this suspicion. 
 
 Accordingly as soon as she found herself alone with 
 her Daughter after dinner, she took her hand, and 
 said to her very kindly, 
 
 " You are a very good Girl, Adelaide, and I 
 am desirous of expressing to you that your con- 
 duct this morning has, if possible, endeared you 
 more than ever to your Father and to me. — Sir 
 George has told me every thing. — He did not of course 
 hear one word of your conversation with Colonel Al- 
 gernon, but he was well aware of the Subject of it, 
 and he read the result in your countenances. The

 effort has I know been a painful one upon your part, 
 but it is over; — And your behaviour to-day has effec- 
 tually relieved you from all apprehension of ever being 
 called upon to make such an exertion in future. Had 
 your Father anticipated what happened, he would have 
 endeavoured to have spared you so painful a trial." 
 
 Adelaide gazed at Lady Fauconberg in silent 
 astonishment. Could her Father have recorded all 
 this ? Could he, unconscious as he had appeared, have 
 been really observing her so narrowly ? — She scarcely 
 believed it possible. — If he had done this, a much 
 more dreadful consideration presented itself to her 
 mind. She had wronged her Mother, — she had not 
 only done her injustice in her own imagination, — she 
 had also been wicked enough to communicate her un- 
 founded suspicions to another person. 
 
 She was so overpowered by these reflections that 
 she made no attempt to speak. 
 
 " What can be the meaning of this silence ? Why 
 do you not answer me my dear Child ?'' demanded 
 Lady Fauconberg, who began to fear that she had 
 been mistaken in her conjectures.

 ADELAIDE. 189 
 
 Adelaide looked up, as she asked with much 
 earnestness, " did my Father indeed tell you all 
 this?" 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's eye sunk, and she felt greatly 
 confused, as she replied, 
 
 " To be sure he did. If he had not done so, how 
 else do you suppose I could have known it ?" 
 
 Adelaide had felt much inclined to throw herself at 
 her Mother's feet to confess her former injurious sus- 
 picions, and humbly to implore her forgiveness; hut 
 there was an asperity, a something altogether in the 
 tone in which she had just spoken, that checked that 
 impulse, and she merely related almost word for word, 
 the first part of what Colonel Algernon had said to 
 her. She added, that she had very decidedly inform- 
 ed him that although she was not engaged, there were 
 certain weighty reasons, confirmed by a solemn pro- 
 mise, that would prevent her ever giving the slightest 
 encouragement to his hopes. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was perfectly satisfied with this 
 information, she had no wish to hear any thing more. 
 All communication between her Daughter and Colo-

 nel Algernon, except as common Acquaintance, was 
 cut off; and in a manner, she flattered herself, which 
 would prevent any danger of a renewal of attachment. 
 She endeavoured to soothe the feelings of her Victim, 
 and telling her truly 6 that she must be fatigued both 
 in mind and body,' — she persuaded her to go to bed 
 long before Sir George came up stairs from the Di- 
 ning-Room. 
 
 Adelaide's remorse at her supposed injustice to- 
 wards her Mother, weighed heavily upon her heart, 
 yet she was so completely exhausted, that she soon 
 sunk into a deep sleep. 
 
 Very early the following morning Sir George Fau- 
 conberg received a note from Colonel Algernon, ex- 
 pressing great regret that an unexpected summons to 
 attend Lord Altamont upon business of importance, 
 would deprive him of the pleasure he had promised 
 himself in dining in Berkeley- Square that day. He 
 added, ' that he should be obliged to leave Town at 
 a very early hour, and as it was uncertain how long 
 he might be detained in the Country, he should con- 
 sider it a great favour if Sir George would write him

 ADELAIDE. 191 
 
 a few lines by his Messenger — to tell him how Miss 
 Fauconberg was, since he felt most anxious to know 
 that she had recovered the effects of her fatigue.' 
 
 " Colonel Algernon's Grandfather is a very trouble- 
 some Personage," observed Sir George, as he handed 
 the note to Lady Fauconberg. 
 
 " He seems to wish us to consider him so," replied 
 her Ladyship. 
 
 " I do not quite know what to make of that young 
 Man," continued the Baronet thoughtfully. — " I am 
 very much inclined to think well of him, but there is 
 something about him I cannot exactly understand." 
 
 " J am very much of the same opinion," said Lady 
 Fauconberg, " but as he never was a favorite of mine, 
 I did not chuse to he the first to express it. I own I 
 am tempted to wish that he may never again come 
 across our path. At any rate he appears now to have 
 taken himself out of our way for some time." 
 
 Adelaide was both startled and grieved when she 
 was told that Colonel Algernon had sent an excuse. 
 An instant's reflection convinced her, however, that 
 after what had passed, it wa9 impossible he could have

 192 ADELAIDE. 
 
 done otherwise. The line of conduct he had taken 
 up in avoiding her, was expedient and honorable ; — it 
 was what she would herself have recommended, had 
 he consulted her. But this did not render the con- 
 viction that their separation had been a final one, the 
 less painfully distressing 1 . 
 
 Not one of the Guests who dined that day with Sir 
 George Fauconberg, found the party less agreable 
 because Colonel Algernon happened to be absent. 
 Adelaide alone could not help frequently thinking 
 how very different it would have been to Aer, if he had 
 been there ; and it was with an aching heart that she 
 endeavoured to assist her Mother in the task of enter- 
 taining her company. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg's first wish was to relieve her 
 Father's kind anxiety about her health, and she lost 
 no opportunity of assuring him ' she was much bet- 
 ter, — indeed quite well.' Lady Fauconberg was 
 evidently desirous of taking her again into society ; 
 Invitations became every day more numerous, and 
 her Ladyship observed that c she thought it could now 
 do her no harm to begin to go out a little in the even-

 ADELAIDE. 193 
 
 iiig.' She hinted too that ' if she allowed her to stay at 
 home much longer, it would look very odd ! — People 
 would certainly imagine that she meant to shut her urj.' 
 
 Adelaide partly felt the truth of these arguments ; 
 Had Colonel Algernon remained in Town, she would 
 have dreaded the idea of meeting him. But he was 
 gone, and his departure had removed all apprehen- 
 sions of that kind. — She therefore delighted her Mo- 
 ther by proposing to accompany her to a Party she 
 was aware she would have been particularly unwil- 
 ling to have given up. 
 
 As Sir George saw that his Daughter was not at 
 all the worse for the first trial, he had no objection to 
 her making a second, and she soon became included 
 in a constant round of Engagements. He had long 
 entertained a suspicion that, her illness had been in 
 some way connected with the anxiety of mind she 
 had suffered during the last year, — he therefore 
 thought that amusement and variety might prove 
 beneficial, — And he only exhorted Lady Fauconberg 
 not to keep her out very late, or allow her to over 
 fatigue herself with dancing.

## p. 194 (#216) ############################################


 
 194 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Sir George's expectations were in a great measure 
 realized. Adelaide, it is true, did not find the same 
 enjoyment in Society she had formerly done, — but a 
 succession of gaiety diverted her thoughts and left 
 them no time to dwell upon painful recollections. 
 
 At first she felt that every thing was become per- 
 fectly indifferent to her, but by degrees she began to 
 be amused and interested by what was passing around 
 her. When the violence of the shock her hopes had 
 received, had abated, her mind recovered its natural 
 tone, and if she still felt that she was not happy, she 
 was at least cheerful and contented. 
 
 It was said that Miss Fauconberg had been ill, and 
 her looks seemed to confirm this assertion. She had 
 grown pale and thin, and her countenance had lost 
 the animation which had formed its greatest charm. 
 Many people now wondered how she could have been 
 so very much admired the season she came out. They 
 admitted that she was a pretty, elegant looking Girl, 
 but added that she had decidedly no claims to be con- 
 sidered a Beauty. 
 
 " How very much Miss Fauconberg is altered !"

 observed Colonel Harcourt to Julia Shirley, as he 
 looked at Adelaide who was dancing opposite to them. 
 " I had been told that she was gone off, but I did not 
 believe it till I saw her." 
 
 u She is certainly gone off" replied Julia, who did 
 not seem quite to like the expression, and who still 
 less liked the scrutinizing glance with which it was 
 accompanied. " Your Friend Colonel Algernon, is 
 gone off too." 
 
 Colonel Harcourt's indignation was very apparent 
 in his countenance, but pretending not to understand 
 her insinuation, — he answered, u I have not met him 
 for some time, but it will not be easy to persuade me 
 that he is changed. Few people are so good looking 
 as Henry Algernon, and one thing I will also venture 
 to say for him, — His conduct has invariably been as 
 open and as handsome as his countenance." 
 
 Colonel Harcourt had arrived in London with a full 
 expectation of finding his Friend's matrimonial ar- 
 rangements completely and satisfactorily settled. — 
 Colonel Algernon's extraordinary disappearance, and 
 the dejection he fancied he could trace in Miss Fau-

 conberg's manner, convinced him that things had not 
 gone on quite so smoothly as he had anticipated. He 
 immediately suspected that there had been foul play. 
 — And he had no hesitation in concluding that the 
 separation of two Persons whose attachment seemed 
 evidently mutual, had been effected by some under- 
 hand contrivance of Lady Fauconberg's. 
 
 Since she had been in Town, Adelaide had as usual 
 seen a great deal of the Miss Shirley s ; the visible 
 coolness that subsisted between her and their Brother, 
 did not in any way interfere with her intimacy with 
 them. 
 
 Mr. Shirley himself made no direct attempt to 
 conciliate her favour. He seldom spoke much to her 
 when they met in public, and though he sometimes 
 accompanied them, when she and her Father hap- 
 pened to overtake him in their rides, — his conversa- 
 tion upon these occasions was almost exclusively 
 addressed to Sir George. 
 
 This conduct effectually persuaded her that he had 
 given up all idea of ever again distressing her by 
 pleading an attachment which he had been informed

 ADELAIDE. 197 
 
 it was not in her power to return ; And she no longer 
 experienced that anxious desire to shun his society, 
 which she had felt more or less, from the moment of 
 his arrival in England. If he talked to her Father, 
 Adelaide now listened with an unprejudiced ear ; and 
 she often confessed to herself that her Mother had 
 done him no more than justice when she said that he 
 possessed great conversational talents, and had also 
 the power of being very amusing and agreable. 
 
 Sometimes the subjects he discussed with Sir 
 George, happened to touch upon points that particu- 
 larly interested her, and then instead of keeping aloof 
 as she had done at first, she very naturally took a part 
 in their conversation. Mr. Shirley affected not to 
 observe this, while he secretly exerted every talent he 
 possessed, to please and entertain her. He joined 
 the Baronet and his Daughter much more frequently 
 than he had before ventured to do; — And Adelaide 
 insensibly found herself established upon a footing of 
 far greater cordiality and friendship with her rejected 
 Admirer, than she had a few months ago imagined it 
 possible she ever could have been.

 Had she thought less of Colonel Algernon since 
 this change had taken place in her feelings towards 
 Mr. Shirley ? — Certainly not. His Image was still 
 constantly associated in her mind with all that was 
 most amiable and excellent. Every thing that was 
 connected with any recollection of Him, seemed pecu- 
 liarly endeared to her. She thought it probable, — 
 indeed she almost hoped, — she should never see him 
 again. Yet she felt an ardent curiosity to learn where 
 he was, to know what had been passing in his mind, 
 and when he was likely to return to London ? 
 
 Meanwhile Lady Fauconberg was secretly en- 
 chanted at the progress Mr. Shirley appeared to be 
 making in Adelaide's good graces. His own hopes 
 were equally sanguine; and when a Dissolution of 
 Parliament called him away from London to prepare 
 for the Contest that was approaching at Oldthorpe, he 
 departed with a comfortable conviction of having left 
 his more interesting affairs in Town, in a very happy 
 train. 
 
 Fortune seemed now to smile upon him. His Elec- 
 tion was triumphantly successful ; — The struggle had

 at first promised to be a severe one, but his Supporters 
 were assured of his liberality, the Principles he pro- 
 fessed, made him popular with the Mob, while his 
 eloquence was lauded and admired by the more 
 respectable class of Voters ; — And he was returned 
 by a very large majority. His speeches were re- 
 corded in every Newspaper, and Mr. Fretwell strut- 
 ted about with more than usual importance, asking 
 every body he met if they thought he had over-rated 
 the talents of his young Friend, the new Member for 
 Oldthorpe ? 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was not a little delighted with 
 the celebrity Mr. Shirley had thus attained. His suc- 
 cess had been communicated to her in a Letter from 
 himself enclosed in his first Frank, but of this flatter- 
 ing circumstance she took care not to boast. 
 
 Adelaide felt much satisfaction at hearing he had 
 gained his Election, and that he had won it in a man- 
 ner that did him so much credit. Yet she did not 
 appear to have taken quite as much interest in this 
 event as her Mother had wished her to do, — And 
 when Lady Fauconberg had been expatiating upon

 the brilliant figure he had made upon his first public 
 appearance, — Adelaide very calmly observed, '■ that 
 Mr. Shirley's success must be gratifying to himself as 
 well as to his Family, since she believed he had not 
 done more than he was aware his Friends had always 
 expected of him.' 
 
 Even when he rode over to Fauconberg Manor 
 " with all his blushing honours thick upon him," 
 to pay a morning visit to his Neighbours upon their 
 arrival in the Country, he could not help fancying that 
 Adelaide expressed less pleasure at his triumph than 
 he had flattered himself she would have done. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg perceived what was passing in 
 his thoughts, and contrived indirectly to remove the 
 mortification he was evidently beginning to feel. She 
 described how greatly rejoiced they had ail been at 
 his prosperity and distinction. She artfully soothed 
 his pride by the most delicate and judicious praise, 
 while she worked upon his vanity by happy and insi- 
 nuating flattery. 
 
 He was much gratified too by the warmth and 
 kindness of Sir George's congratulations. — Com-

 mendation from him was doubly valuable because it 
 was always sincere and disinterested ; — And as they 
 thought differently upon political subjects, he had not 
 felt quite sure that the worthy Baronet would have 
 received hirn with so much approbation after reading 
 the sentiments he had expressed in his Election 
 Speeches. 
 
 We have remarked before, that extreme vanity 
 was one of the weak points of Mr. Shirley's character. 
 His recent success at Oldthorpe had exalted him 
 greatly in his own opinion. The adulation of his 
 Friends there, and the encomiums he had since re- 
 ceived upon his talents from other quarters, — had 
 completed his mental intoxication. He had just ob- 
 tained a Victory, where a Person of inferior abilities 
 would probably have suffered a defeat ; — And he fan- 
 cied that no moment could be more propitious for 
 pleading his suit to Miss Fauconberg. 
 
 If he had been able to overcome her prejudices, 
 and render himself agreable to her in London, — 
 which he had no doubt he had done ; he thought his 
 eloquence now, must prove perfectly irresistible.

 And without consulting his best Friend Lady Faucon- 
 berg, or even communicating his intentions to her, 
 he determined to seize the first opportunity he could 
 find, of throwing himself at Adelaide's feet. 
 
 He had been commissioned by his Father to ask 
 the Fauconberg Family to dine and spend the follow- 
 ing day at Greyfield. The invitation was accepted ; 
 Sir George said he was afraid he should not be able 
 to leave home very early, but as summer nights were 
 never dark, he should be in no hurry to order his car- 
 riage in the evening. 
 
 " We are quite alone,'' concluded Mr. Shirley, 
 " you will meet nobody but my Cousin Arthur Ver- 
 non, who is you know one of ourselves." 
 
 As the Reader is not so well acquainted with Cap- 
 tain Arthur Vernon's connection with the Shirley's, 
 as Sir George and Lady Fauconberg seemed to be, 
 it is necessary briefly to explain who he was. 
 
 Sir William Shirley's only Sister had been married 
 very young to an amiable Man of good Family but 
 small fortune. Mr. Vernon's Father had been dread- 
 fully extravagant, and when he at length found him-

 self weighed down by increasing distress and diffi- 
 culty, he persuaded his Son to consent to his cutting 
 off the entail of his property ; and immediately sold 
 an Estate that had descended to him from many gene- 
 rations of Ancestors. With the wreck of his fortune 
 he purchased a very small Place, far distant from his 
 former abode in the North. He did not long sur- 
 vive his removal, and it was at the secluded habita- 
 tion he had chosen for himself, that young Mr. and 
 Mrs. Vernon established themselves upon their mar- 
 riage. 
 
 They had not the means of mixing a great deal in 
 society, but they were so happy in each other that 
 they did not much regret that circumstance ; and it 
 was not until their Children began to grow up that 
 they felt the vexation and discomfort of not being able 
 to give them all the advantages they desired for them. 
 
 Sir William Shirley and his Sister had been warmly 
 attached to each other, and though they did not meet 
 very frequently after her marriage, their mutual affec- 
 tion remained undiminished. Upon the death of 
 Lady Shirley, Mrs. Vernon hastened to Greyfield to

 endeavour to comfort and console her Brother, — and 
 forgetting all her own concerns, remained with him 
 till the first bitterness of his affliction was abated. — 
 She afterwards persuaded him to spend some time 
 with her and Mr. Vernon; Her Nephew was then 
 gone to school, and her Nieces were left at home with 
 their Governess, under the surveilliance of Lady Fau- 
 conberg. 
 
 It was not until the year before the commencement 
 of our Narrative, that Mr. and Mrs. Vernon again 
 visited the North ; their two Daughters, who were 
 rather younger than the Miss Shirleys accompanied 
 them. They were all much struck with Emily's 
 beauty, and if her Aunt had too much discernment 
 not to perceive the failings in her character, she justly 
 attributed them to over indulgence. She was greatly 
 prepossessed in her favour also, by her affectionate 
 manner towards herself and her Cousins, and by the 
 docility with which she attended to any hints that 
 were given her. Julia made a much less agreable 
 impression upon Mrs. Vernon, — her satirical disposi- 
 tion distressed her, and the more she saw of her, the

 A D E L A r D E . 205 
 
 more she became convinced that she had not been 
 mistaken in considering her very wayward and self- 
 willed. 
 
 Julia was aware that she did not please her Rela- 
 tions ; their visit had never given her satisfaction. 
 
 " Her Cousins," she said, " were certainly very 
 good, amiable, well-informed Girls, — far too good to 
 suit her. And her Aunt was no doubt a most excel- 
 lent, exemplary person, — but she was so fearfully ex- 
 cellent, that she could make no allowance for the 
 failings of those who were less perfect than herself. — 
 As far as her own private feelings were concerned, 
 she should be greatly relieved when the whole party 
 were gone.'' 
 
 When Mr. and Mrs.Vernon were at Grey field, their 
 three Sons were dispersed in different parts of the 
 world. Arthur, the eldest, had entered the Army at 
 an early age ; his Father had obtained for him a Com- 
 mission in a marching Regiment which was soon sent 
 upon Foreign Service, and he remained abroad till the 
 termination of the war; having gained the esteem of 
 all his brother Officers, and acquired as much credit

 as it was possible for a young Man in his situation to 
 obtain. Since his return to England he had employ- 
 ed his leisure hours at his Country Quarters, in read- 
 ing and improving his mind by studies he had never 
 before found time to attend to. He possessed great 
 steadiness of character without any affectation of su- 
 periority, — was particularly well informed without 
 being pedantic, — was reckoned handsome by many 
 people, and agreable by almost every body. 
 
 Such was the Nephew who was now come to make 
 acquaintance with his Uncle's Family, and to spend 
 two months of his Long Leave at Greyfield. 
 
 The second Brother was destined for the Church, 
 and the Living of Greyfield was held for him until he 
 was old enough to Take Orders. He was Sir William's 
 God-Son, and the Baronet with delicate kindness had 
 insisted upon placing him at College, since he said 
 the preferment he had to offer him, was so small that 
 it would not otherwise be worth the education that 
 was necessary to enable him to accept it, William 
 Vernon had spent more than one of his Vacations in 
 the North, and was deservedly a great favourite with 
 all his relations there.

 The youngest of Mr. Vernon's Sons was in the Navy. 
 And since he first entered his Profession, very little of 
 his time had been passed with his Family on shore. 
 
 We must now resume the thread of our Story. 
 While the party at Greyfielcl were expecting the arri- 
 val of their neighbours from Fauconberg, Captain Ver- 
 non expressed much curiosity to see Miss Fauconberg. 
 
 " She is so captivating," observed Sir William, 
 " that I must warn you Arthur not to fall in 
 love with her. I hope you will some day find an 
 Heiress equally worthy of you, but I am so much 
 attached to our pretty little Adelaide myself, that I 
 cannot bestow her even upon my Nephew.'' 
 
 Captain Vernon looked considerably disconcerted 
 while he assured his Uncle there was no danger of 
 his losing his heart to Miss Fauconberg. — Emily 
 changed colour, and Julia remarked, " that she was 
 persuaded Arthur was much too honourable, and had 
 learnt his relative duty too well, to be ever guilty of 
 poaching upon another person's Manor, even though 
 the tempting Manor of Fauconberg itself might come 
 in the way."

 The approach of the Visitors put an end to all fur- 
 ther discussion. They were welcomed in the warmest 
 manner by Sir William ; the evident pride he felt in 
 his Son's success, and the pleasure he expressed at 
 having his Nephew with him, seemed to have com- 
 municated themselves to all around him. The whole 
 Family were in high spirits, and even Emily looked 
 more than usually animated. 
 
 Sir George and Lady Fauconberg participated 
 very heartily in their happiness, and Adelaide also 
 witnessed it with feelings of sincere satisfaction. 
 
 The day had been very hot, and after dinner the 
 Ladies wandered out into the Garden, where they 
 were joined indue course of time by the Gentlemen. 
 
 The two Baronets, who probably thought they had 
 had exercise enough in the morning, took quiet pos- 
 session of a rustic seat. The corresponding seat was 
 already occupied by Lady Fauconberg and Julia ; the 
 former was eagerly listening to Election Stories, which 
 her Companion was amusing herself by relating with 
 her own additions and embellishments. Emily and 
 Adelaide who felt little interest in these details, had

 rambled on to look at some intended alterations in the 
 disposition of the flower borders; and they were 
 busily engaged in planning improvements and fancy- 
 ing what would be the effect of different forms, — when 
 they were overtaken by Mr. Shirley and Captain 
 Vernon. 
 
 " I have lived too long abroad," said Mr. Shirley 
 gaily, " to admire the very English fashion of divi- 
 ding the Ladies and Gentlemen into separate parties. 
 I am determined to endeavour to introduce better 
 things here, so pray Miss Fauconberg allow me to 
 offer you my arm, while Arthur will I dare say be 
 able to persuade Emily to accept his." 
 
 As he spoke he drew Adelaide's arm within his 
 own. Captain Vernon immediately followed his ex- 
 ample, he lingered however with Emily to admire her 
 flowers, and did not seem at all inclined to interrupt 
 his Cousin's tete a tete with Miss Fauconberg. 
 
 Mr. Shirley muttered something to his Companion 
 about wishing to show her a beautiful view of the 
 Fauconberg Woods from an opening that had been 
 lately made by the removal of some old trees ; as he

 led her to a pretty Arbour that had been erected at 
 the edge of the plantation. The Moon was rising 
 over the distant landscape, and there was something 
 almost impressive in the tranquil beauty of the scene. 
 Adelaide evidently felt this, and Mr. Shirley pressed 
 her to sit down for a few moments. He placed him- 
 self beside her, and suddenly turning the conversa- 
 tion to the subject that had been for many months 
 nearest to his heart, he poured forth an eloquent 
 and passionate declaration of his devoted and unalter- 
 able attachment. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg was so petrified with astonish- 
 ment and concern, that she was at first unable to 
 make him any answer. He imagined her silence im- 
 plied that she would at length consent to reward his 
 constancy ; and under this impression he was begin- 
 ning to speak of gratitude and happiness, — when 
 Adelaide at once removed the pleasing delusion, by 
 giving him a short explanation of the nature of her 
 sentiments towards him. Her language was kind, 
 and she seemed anxious to wound his feelings as 
 little as possible ; yet her rejection of his suit was so

 decided, that he did not even attempt to press it fur- 
 ther. 
 
 " I hope," concluded she, u that I have not said 
 any thing that can appear harsh or ungrateful. 
 I feel how much reason I have to be flattered by your 
 preference, though it is out of my power to return it. 
 — I had trusted indeed that you would have spared 
 me the painful — the distressing necessity of repeating 
 all this to you myself, since what you have now heard 
 is only a repetition of what my Mother I believe told 
 you from me, several months ago. When I met 
 you after that communication had been made to you, 
 I thought it very natural you should avoid even speak- 
 ing to me ; but when the awkwardness we had both 
 felt at first, had had time to wear off, I imagined there 
 was no cause that need prevent our considering each 
 other as Friends. Many circumstances made it de- 
 sirable we should do so. Your Sisters were my earliest 
 Friends, our Families were near Neighbours in the 
 Country, and I met you constantly in London. I be- 
 lieve too that we understood one another perfectly 
 well. I now regret to find how much I was mistaken.

 If under that persuasion I have unconsciously led you 
 to encourage false hopes, I am sorry for it, — but I 
 can truly assure you that upon my part, the mischief 
 has been unintentional." 
 
 While Adelaide continued speaking, Mr. Shirley 
 made few efforts to interrupt her. Once or twice 
 when she happened to pause, — he rose, paced back- 
 wards and forwards in front of the Arbour with hasty 
 strides, and then sat down again. His surprise, mor- 
 tification, and disappointment were so excessive that 
 he dared not trust himself, — perhaps also he was 
 ashamed, to express his feelings. One moment his 
 attachment to Miss Fauconberg seemed only to be 
 encreased by the repulse he had just received; 
 while the next, his proud Spirit was tempted to resent 
 her coldness, — and he felt more than half inclined to 
 hate her. His former jealousy of Colonel Algernon 
 revived with redoubled force, and so completely did 
 his evil passions gain the ascendancy over every good 
 and generous feeling, that he experienced a savage 
 sort of satisfaction in thinking that if Adelaide would 
 not be persuaded to make him happy, he had at least

 had it in his power to prevent her ever bestowing her 
 hand upon the favoured Rival for whose sake she had 
 so obstinately rejected him. 
 
 MissFauconberg observed 6 that it was growing late,' 
 and proposed they should xejoin the rest of the Party. 
 
 " And upon what footing," asked Mr Shirley, en- 
 deavouring to suppress his emotion, " are we to con- 
 sider ourselves placed, when I may happen to see you 
 again ?" 
 
 " That must depend entirely upon yourself,'' re- 
 plied Adelaide, — " as far as I am concerned, I shall 
 wish to forget every thi ng that has occurred this even- 
 ing. To my Father and Mother it will of course be 
 my duty to mention what has passed, — but no other 
 person will ever receive a hint of it from we, or I will 
 venture to add, from them." 
 
 Mr. Shirley was silent for a few moments. He 
 bitterly repented his own rash folly in having precipi- 
 tately hurried forward an explanation which had com- 
 pletely ruined his hopes for life. And he could not 
 endure the prospect of receiving merited reproaches 
 from such a woman as Lady Fauconberg. 
 
 At length he said, " I am not insensible of your

 kindness and consideration, but I must be blessed 
 with the indifference You feel, before I can conceal 
 rny mortification from the world, by learning to act 
 a part with ease and calmness." 
 
 " Indifferent as you imagine me to be," answered 
 Adelaide, " I assure you the pain I have now given 
 you, has grieved me to the heart. I know you are 
 too generous to feel long unjustly angry with any 
 body. My esteem and regard you will always possess. 
 — Why then, may we not still he Friends ?" 
 
 She held out her hand to him as she spoke. Mr. 
 Shirley was softened ; he felt a severe pang of re- 
 morse, as he exclaimed, 
 
 " This is too much ! I have not deserved such 
 goodness! Oh Adelaide, Miss Fauconberg I mean, 
 — I beseech you to forgive me. I have spoken and 
 behaved like a Madman, — the next time we meet, I 
 will promise to be more rational, to be more worthy 
 of the place you have allowed me to retain in your 
 regard. I always believed you kind and amiable, — 
 but I can never forget the patient gentleness with 
 which you have borne with my wayward violence this 
 evening."

 " Hear me with patience but to speak a word." 
 
 Shakspeare. 
 
 When Adelaide and Mr. Shirley came near the 
 House, they met Lady Fauconberg and Julia, — the 
 latter asked what had become of Emily and Arthur ? 
 
 u I do not know," replied Miss Fauconberg, " we 
 left them in the Flower Garden." 
 
 Mr. Shirley said he would go and look for them. 
 In his present agitated state of mind he was very glad 
 to find an excuse to escape the scrutiny of two such 
 acute Observers as his Sister and her Companion. 
 
 " William is really uncommonly obliging," re- 
 marked Julia, " I never expected he would have 
 flown with so much alacrity to obey a wish of mme." 
 
 The last word was pronounced with emphasis, and 
 she looked at Adelaide as she spoke. Then lowering 
 her voice she added, — " I hope those he is gone

 in search of, will feel as grateful to him as I do, for 
 his kind exertions to bring all our Party together 
 again." 
 
 66 Your Father," said Lady Fauconberg, addressing 
 her Daughter, " begins to think it grows late, and to 
 talk of ordering the carriage, but Sir William with 
 his usual kindness, will not hear of our departing just 
 
 yet." 
 
 Adelaide felt herself placed in so awkward a situa- 
 tion, that she was much relieved when she at length 
 heard the sound of wheels driving up to the door. 
 The visible distraction of Mr. Shirley's manner dis- 
 tressed her extremely. The almost parental kindness 
 of Sir William's behaviour towards herself, convinced 
 her that he had shared and promoted his son's hopes ; 
 and it grieved her much to think how soon the happy 
 gaiety of the whole Family would be clouded by 
 learning that she had rejected the flattering offer that 
 had been made to her. 
 
 While Mr. Shirley was assisting Lady Fauconberg 
 to put on her Cloak, she told him that his Father and 
 Sisters had promised to come to Fauconberg the fol-

 'owing week, and that she hoped he would consider 
 himself included in the Engagement. " If you and 
 Captain Vernon," added she, " have nothing better to 
 do, Why should you not also come over and dine with 
 us the day after to-morrow ?" 
 
 u Arthur would be very happy to do so, I dare 
 say," replied Mr. Shirley with much embarrassment, 
 " but I am afraid it will not be in my power to — have 
 — that pleasure." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg looked at him with great sur- 
 prise. 
 
 He seemed struggling with some powerful feeling, 
 as he continued in a low and hurried tone, — 
 
 " You will soon know every thing from Miss Fau- 
 conberg, therefore any attempt at concealment upon 
 my part would be absurd. Besides it is a debt of 
 gratitude I owe to the kindness you have always 
 shown me, to be myself the first person to inform you 
 that that kindness has unhappily been exerted in vain. 
 — I have been hurried on by circumstances, — mad- 
 ness, — I know not what, — to hazard a declaration of 
 my sentiments. It has been received by Miss Fau-

 218 ADELAIDE. 
 
 conberg as I ought to have known it would have been, 
 that is to say, in a manner that has effectually de- 
 stroyed my hopes for ever." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was so overcome by this unex- 
 pected communication, that she was obliged to take 
 hold of Mr. Shirley's arm to support herself. 
 
 " This," exclaimed she, " is indeed a blow I had 
 not anticipated ! How could you be so imprudent ? — 
 But it is impossible to talk to you here. We shall 
 meet again." 
 
 And both remained silent as he conducted her 
 Ladyship to her Carriage. 
 
 The moment the door was shut, she threw herself 
 back, and so completely was she absorbed in her own 
 reflections, that she made no attempt to enter into 
 conversation with her Companions. It was not her 
 disappointment alone, severe as that was, that dis- 
 tressed her; she was also afraid that Mr. Shirley's 
 rashness must infallibly bring to light her own dupli- 
 city, — And under this apprehension the agony of her 
 mind may be better imagined than described. 
 
 Adelaide did not seem much more inclined to

 speak than her Mother ; — And Sir George at length 
 enquired the cause of this extraordinary silence ? 
 Observing that he could almost fancy himself at a 
 Quaker's Meeting. 
 
 M I have made several efforts to get the better of 
 my embarrassment," said Adelaide, u for I have 
 something to communicate to You and to Mama : but 
 I do not know exactly how to begin. — I am afraid 
 you will be much displeased with me." 
 
 The kind encouragement she received from her 
 Father emboldened her to proceed, and she gave her 
 Parents a minute account of the scene that had taken 
 place between her and Mr. Shirley. She confined 
 her details, however, to the present time, and made 
 no allusion to any circumstances that had occurred at 
 a former period. 
 
 While Adelaide was narrating what had passed, 
 Lady Fauconberg literally gasped for breath ! Sir 
 George listened more calmly but with deep attention, 
 and when her tale was told, he said to her, 
 
 " If you are really persuaded that you could not 
 have been happy with Mr. Shirley, you were quite

 right in acting as you have done. But I must own I 
 am sorry for it. — In an affair of this kind, where You 
 are to be the party principally concerned, I shall ne- 
 ver desire to influence you strongly in favour of any 
 body. I wish you to judge and to decide for yourself." 
 
 Adelaide expressed her gratitude for this kindness 
 very warmly, — and her Father thus continued, 
 
 " I confess I did not much fancy Mr. Shirley my- 
 self, when he first returned to England, but what I 
 have seen of him lately has raised him in my good 
 opinion. I say nothing of his talents or his situation 
 in the world. I believe his attachment to You is 
 very sincere, and could you therefore have returned 
 it, your Union with him, my dear Adelaide, would 
 have made both your Mother and me extremely hap- 
 py. We should have seen you received into a Family 
 by every Member of which you would have been 
 appreciated and beloved, — And in addition to this we 
 should have enjoyed the great comfort of keeping you 
 still in our own neighbourhood. — But I do not intend 
 to reproach you, my Love, and far less to afflict you 
 by any selfish regrets of ours."

 (For at that moment the moonlight fell strongly 
 upon Miss Fauconberg's countenance, every feature 
 of which betrayed how much she was distressed.) 
 
 fi I have only one more observation to make before 
 we take leave of this unpleasant subject. I sincerely 
 hope that your rejection of Mr. Shirley has been in 
 no way connected with any preference you may have 
 formerly felt for Colonel Algernon." 
 
 " I know," replied Adelaide, " that I ought to 
 forget Colonel Algernon, and I can truly assure you 
 that I have endeavoured to do so. — Perhaps it is my 
 duty to add, that if I had never seen him, I am not 
 sure T should have found it quite so impossible to 
 like — to accept — Mr. Shirley." 
 
 u Would to God you never had seen him, my poor 
 Child!" exclaimed Sir George, with great vehemence. 
 a He is one of those people I can least bear to think 
 of, — even to hear mentioned with any degree of pa- 
 tience. — He is far too brilliant and ugreable not to be 
 admired and courted in Society. You know how 
 much I used to admire him. I also imagined he was 
 as amiable as he appeared to be ; and so strongly was

 222 ADELAIDE. 
 
 I prepossessed in his favour, that I could not easily have 
 believed he was in truth as heartless and unprincipled 
 as his conduct towards You has proved him." 
 
 Adelaide was so completely thrown off her guard 
 by hearing Colonel Algernon thus cruelly wronged, 
 that she could not resist attempting to justify him in 
 her Father's estimation. 
 
 " Indeed, indeed Papa," said she, " if you think 
 Colonel Algernon heartless or unprincipled, you are 
 very much deceived. He has been placed in peculiar 
 circumstances, — he may never have an opportunity of 
 explaining to you the motives by which he was in- 
 fluenced, — but you may be assured that his behaviour 
 towards me has always been most strictly honorable, 
 kind, and considerate." 
 
 " If you do not wish to hear me curse him," cried 
 Sir George, and his words, and the tone in which 
 they were spoken, made his Daughter's blood run 
 cold ; u I warn you not to plead again in this way in 
 his behalf; — Unless indeed you are empowered to

 upon which you seem to insinuate that your appro- 
 bation of his proceedings has been founded."

 Lady Fauconberg had not yet taken any part in 
 the discussion, but she now thought it high time to 
 interfere and prevent the danger of a further expla- 
 nation. 
 
 " Adelaide," she said, " You only irritate your 
 Father, and encrease the anger he feels against Co- 
 lonel Algernon, by trying to defend him as you have 
 done. We are none of us perhaps at this moment in 
 a state to judge calmly and dispassionately of any 
 thing; and enough has already transpired about this 
 unfortunate Young Man, to show us that the subject 
 had better have been left entirely at rest." 
 
 " I believe you are very right," observed Sir 
 George, who was evidently softened by Lady Fau- 
 conberg's mediation : — " I have been led too to express 
 myself more strongly than I intended. — But tell me, 
 Adelaide, have you really any cause to suppose that 
 Colonel Algernon is less in fault than I have imagined 
 him to be ? I should be sorry to do him, or any body 
 else, injustice." 
 
 Adelaide had been recalled to her recollection by 
 Lady Fauconberg's expostulation. She could no Ion-

 ger entertain any doubt that her Mother had deceived 
 her, and had also failed to perform a principal article of 
 their agreement, by concealing every circumstance re- 
 lating to it from Sir George. — This painful conviction 
 rendered her, however, only more anxious to bury the 
 whole business in oblivion ; and as she saw the im- 
 possibility of attempting any further justification of 
 Colonel Algernon, she merely said, in reply to her 
 Father's question, — 
 
 " I am firmly persuaded that in every thing re- 
 garding his conduct towards me, he has been perfectly 
 blameless. But as I am unable to bring forward any 
 proofs to support my own belief, I should not have 
 ventured to assert it unless I had been required to do 
 so. You shall never hear his name again from my 
 lips, and I hope you will now forgive me for having 
 spoken so decidedly." 
 
 " I do, I do," replied Sir George. u I also chari- 
 tably wish you may not be mistaken in the favorable 
 judgment you have formed of Colonel Algernon's 
 character. Upon that point we still think very diffe- 
 rently, — And right or wrong, as neither of us seem

 likely to give up our own opinion, — the wisest course 
 we can take is to follow your Mother's advice and say 
 no more about the matter." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg knew Adelaide too well to have 
 any apprehension that she would intentionally betray 
 her duplicity to Sir George, — yet great as was her 
 relief when all clanger of an exposure had passed, it 
 by no means equalled the humiliation she felt at the 
 contemptible light in which she was conscious her be- 
 haviour must appear before her Daughter. 
 
 After they arrived at home, she and her Husband 
 naturally recurred to the subject of Mr. Shirley's dis- 
 appointment, and talked over their own views and 
 feelings regarding it, very fully. 
 
 " It is very strange," at length observed Sir George, 
 " but I will confess to you that the earnest confidence 
 with which Adelaide defended Colonel Algernon, has 
 made an impression upon my mind that I am unable 
 to throw off. I cannot help fancying she knows more 
 about him than she may perhaps be quite at liberty to 
 tell us. — I never could account satisfactorily for her 
 agitation the last time he rode with us in the Park, —

 I always suspected that something more had transpired 
 in their tete k tete that day, than you or I were ex- 
 actly aware of ; — and all that has passed to-night has 
 tended to confirm that idea." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg had changed colour several 
 times. 
 
 (i I cannot," replied she, " attach the same impor- 
 tance to Adelaide's zeal in advocating Colonel Alger- 
 non's cause, that you do. You must remember that 
 every Young Lady of her age, is credulous enough to 
 believe that the Hero of her own Romance can do no 
 wrong. We know that the accomplished Colonel 
 spared no pains to establish himself in her good opi- 
 nion, — we have also reason to know that he has suc- 
 ceeded too well. — It is very probable that during the 
 ride you allude to, he found an opportunity of telling 
 her he was going to leave Town the following morn- 
 ing, and also of making some artful excuse to account 
 for the length of his intended absence. Such a sup- 
 position will sufficiently explain the distress that was 
 so evident to you in her manner. — Had he then made 
 any decided declaration of his sentiments, had he in

 short said any thing" important enough to be repeated 
 to her Parents, — her behaviour this evening* has proved 
 that she would not have concealed it from us." 
 
 "All this may be very true," rejoined Sir George, 
 " but still I would give a great deal to ascertain what 
 is Colonel Algernon's real character, and to be made 
 acquainted with the motives that have regulated his 
 conduct towards Adelaide. If he is as unworthy as I 
 have long considered him, it would make me mise- 
 rable to perceive the strong hold he still maintains 
 upon her affections. — If on the contrary, I have 
 wronged him, I might have it in my power to render 
 him ample reparation." 
 
 u What can you mean, Sir George ?" exclaimed 
 Lady Fauconberg. " Colonel Algernon has deci- 
 dedly shown you that he wishes to decline our ac- 
 quaintance. After such treatment, is it possible for 
 You to make any advances towards a renewal of 
 friendship with him ?" 
 
 " Certainly not. Any direct overtures of that kind 
 upon my part are out of the question. But I am al- 
 together worried and uncomfortable. — If Mr. Shirley

 has been as communicative to his Father, as our deal- 
 Adelaide has been to us, — I imagine poor Sir William 
 is not at this moment in a much happier frame of 
 mind than I am." 
 
 It may easily be supposed that Miss Fauconberg's 
 rest that night was neither very tranquil or refreshing, 
 yet her feelings were enviable compared with those 
 of her Mother, whose conscience reproached her with 
 having- caused her own distress and that of every one 
 connected with her. The favorite project which she 
 had laboured so strenuously and so unworthily to 
 promote, had been entirely defeated. — And she knew 
 that she deserved the disappointment, mortification, 
 and disgrace that this failure had brought upon her. 
 She perceived it was more than probable that an ex- 
 planation must sooner or later take place between Sir 
 George and Colonel Algernon, and she was well 
 aware such an event would most likely lead to his 
 Union with Adelaide. In that case her long train of 
 unsuccessful artifice would have gained her nothing 
 but the odium of having deceived her Husband and 
 opposed her Daughter's happiness.

 The severe lesson she had just received, had not, 
 however, cured her of her love of manoeuvring, — and 
 with the true spirit of intrigue she cletennined to be 
 prepared for whatever turn affairs might take. She 
 had not the generosity to think of promoting the re- 
 conciliation she foresaw ; but she fancied she might 
 contrive to act in such a manner as to gain some share 
 of merit with Adelaide, should it ever occur. Accord- 
 ingly she took an opportunity of telling her Daughter, 
 the next morning, how very much gratified she felt 
 by her whole conduct towards her Father and herself. 
 
 " There is another thing I wish to mention," added 
 she, — " As our former agreement was entered into 
 upon an understanding that the different conditions 
 were to be faithfully observed by both parties, the 
 failure of one naturally dissolves the obligation of the 
 other. You have very strictly conformed to your 
 engagement, but as Mr. Shirley's behaviour last 
 night was a complete infringement of mine, you will 
 now of course consider yourself released from your 
 promise respecting Colonel Algernon." 
 
 An exclamation of surprise and delight burst from

 230 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Adelaide's lips, yet the flush of pleasure faded almost 
 instantly from her cheek as she recollected that the 
 boon which would have been so welcome some months 
 earlier, had now been given too late. She had herself 
 informed Colonel Algernon that an obstacle existed 
 which would probably separate them for life ; and it 
 was impossible he should learn from her that that 
 bar had been removed. — The concession therefore, — 
 coming as it did, — instead of relieving her mind, only 
 served to aggravate her discomfort and regret. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg neither heard or saw any thing 
 of the Shirley Family until the day on which they 
 were all engaged to dine at Fauconberg. To take 
 away the awkwardness of a small Party, several of 
 their Neighbours had been invited to meet them, and 
 the uncomfortable stiffness that was mutually felt 
 during the first moments that succeeded the arrival 
 of the Guests from Greyfield, very soon began to wear 
 off. A few cordial words of explanation and regret 
 put the two Baronets at once at ease and in good 
 humour with each other. 
 
 The Young Ladies seemed anxious to show that 
 they wished their friendship to remain unaltered.

 ADELAIDE. 231 
 
 But when Lady Fauconberg made an attempt to 
 enter into a confidential conversation with Mr. Shir- 
 ley, he abruptly turned the subject, and by this un- 
 gracious treatment put the finishing stroke to her 
 vexation. 
 
 On his entrance, Mr. Shirley had so completely dis- 
 guised his feelings, that he had appeared far the most 
 composed and indifferent person in the whole party. 
 His behaviour had mortified the Mother's vanity, 
 but had had a very different effect upon the Daugh- 
 ter. Adelaide was indeed surprised at his ease and 
 gaiety, but it gave her very sincere satisfaction to 
 believe that his disappointment must have been much 
 less severe than she had been led to imagine it. 
 
 The ice having once been broken, the two Families 
 continued afterwards to meet as usual. Mr. Shirley 
 did not often go to Fauconberg, but in public he 
 seemed to seek rather than to avoid Adelaide's society. 
 Still it was confidently whispered in the world that he 
 had been refused. How such rumours are first cir- 
 culated, it is impossible to discover, — but whenever 
 there is any serious foundation for them they are sure

 to get abroad. Every body agreed that if he had 
 been slighted, he bore his mortification heroically ; 
 And as his attention was much engrossed by political 
 subjects, it was supposed that Ambition would now 
 become the Ruling Passion in his mind, and that he 
 looked forward to the hope of distinguishing himself 
 in Parliament.

 Time wore on, — Mr. Shirley had accepted an 
 invitation to join a Shooting Party in Scotland, and 
 seemed to be so well amused in the Highlands, that 
 he was in no hurry to return home. Captain Vernon 
 still lingered at Greyfield, and every hour encreased 
 the reluctance he felt at the idea of bidding adieu to 
 his Relations there. He had originally intended to 
 make a short visit to his Father and Mother before 
 he rejoined his Regiment, but he had now given up 
 that plan and determined to remain in the North 
 until the expiration of his Leave. Sir William was

 delighted to detain him, and perhaps his Uncle was 
 the only person who had not perceived that his grow- 
 ing attachment for Emily was the Spell that enchain- 
 ed him to Greyfield. He thought it was very natural 
 that Arthur should admire his Cousin, and that they 
 should feel happy in each other's society ; — their near 
 relationship put them almost upon the footing of a 
 Brother and Sister, and he never dreamed of the pos- 
 sibility of their thinking of a more tender connection. 
 He had always expected that his favourite Daughter 
 would make a very brilliant alliance. — He had some 
 reason to believe that that hope would at no very dis- 
 tant period be realized; — and much as he loved his 
 Nephew and admired his character, he could in a 
 worldly point of view consider him only a pennyless 
 Soldier of Fortune. As such, the idea of his aspiring 
 to be Emily's future Husband, seemed perfectly out 
 of the question. 
 
 Arthur had been much prepossessed in his Cousin's 
 favour by the accounts he had heard of her from his 
 Mother and Sisters. Her beauty and gentleness 
 made a deep impression upon his heart, and he was

 ADELAIDE. 235 
 
 extremely flattered by the pleasure she appeared to 
 tind in his society. She was highly accomplished, 
 but he discovered that more pains had been taken with 
 the cultivation of her talents, than the improvement 
 of her mind. It was her conversations with him that 
 made her first aware of her own deficiency in many 
 respects, — she became anxious to make up for lost 
 time, and Captain Vernon's good sense and superior 
 information enabled him to be of much use to her in 
 directing and assisting her studies. He did not quite 
 know how dangerous this agreable task would be to 
 himself, — his whole mind was absorbed in it, and he 
 watched with triumph and delight the benefit and im- 
 provement his amiable Pupil was deriving from his 
 advice and instructions. Indeed it was evident to 
 every one, that Emily's desire to render herself wor- 
 thy of the affection of such a young Man as Arthur, 
 had roused her from her former indolence of mind, 
 and taught her to shake off those foibles and defects 
 which had long shaded her character, and obscured 
 its excellence. 
 
 Julia did not often intrude her company where she

 well knew it was not desired. u Arthurs conversa- 
 tion," she said u was too sensible and learned to 
 please her, it was much better bestowed upon Emily 
 by whom it seemed to be duly appreciated. — Her 
 Cousin was just like the rest of the Vernon Family, — 
 she had a great respect and veneration for them all, 
 — but as Companions she did not particularly fancy 
 any of them." 
 
 Her Sister's free indulgence of her talent for ridi- 
 cule was a subject of deep regret to Emily, she per- 
 ceived how many enemies she made herself in that 
 way, and in what an unamiable point of view it placed 
 her. But remonstrance and admonition were alike 
 disregarded by Julia; and upon one occasion when 
 Emily had been in vain requesting her not to repeat 
 beyond their own circle, a ludicrous but very ill-na- 
 tured Story which she had herself considerably em- 
 bellished, — Arthur observed to his Cousin, 
 
 " My dear Emily, it is of no avail ; there is an old 
 Proverb which tells us that ' the wilful Man will have 
 his way,' and I suppose the Saying applies equally to 
 Young Ladies of that unfortunate disposition. We

 can only hope that as Julia grows older she will also 
 grow wiser and more tractable. In the mean time it 
 will do Her no good, and You a great deal of harm to 
 distress yourself about her." 
 
 Captain Vernon's passion for his Cousin had gained 
 strength so insensibly, — such a variety of circum- 
 stances had combined to heighten the interest he felt 
 in every thing that concerned her, that he was not en- 
 tirely aware of the nature of his own sentiments, 
 until the truth was suddenly revealed to him by an 
 unexpected communication from his Uncle. 
 
 Sir William came in to breakfast one morning with 
 several open Letters in his hand, and had evidently 
 just received some pleasing and important piece of 
 intelligence. Julia's curiosity was instantly excited, 
 and she made many efforts to discover the cause of his 
 satisfaction, but he parried all her questions in her 
 own way, and playfully told her that i he knew her 
 too well to trust her with any of his secrets.' 
 
 When the Young Ladies had left the room, Sir 
 William said to his Nephew, u I expect a Visitor 
 here shortly ; — Lord Stanmore has written to me to

 say that if it suits my convenience to receive him, he 
 proposes himself the pleasure of spending- a few days 
 at Greyfield next week, in his way from Scotland. 
 
 As William is not at home, it will be a great 
 acquisition to me to have You to assist me to enter- 
 tain him. Besides, I want to make you known to 
 each other ; for I will let you into a little confidence 
 my dear Arthur. — Lord Stanmore was very much 
 struck with Emily when he saw her in Town last 
 Spring, and I should not be excessively surprised if 
 he were some day or other to become a Cousin of 
 Yours." 
 
 Captain Vernon was so completely thunderstruck, 
 that he found great difficulty in stammering out any 
 thing like a suitable reply. 
 
 16 1 see that I have surprised You," continued Sir 
 William, " it would certainly be a very great Partie 
 for Emily, — but to You who know her so well, I may 
 venture to say that such a choice would do much 
 credit to the noble Peer's good taste and discern- 
 ment." 
 
 a It would indeed," exclaimed Arthur almost un-

 ADELAIDE. 239 
 
 consciously. " But what sort of person is Lord Stan- 
 more ? for as yet I only know him by name." 
 
 " I really believe he is a very excellent and honor- 
 able man, and I have reason to think him so well 
 principled that I should feel no scruple in trusting 
 him with the guardianship of my Daughter's happi- 
 ness. I have been slightly acquainted with him for 
 a long time, but it never came in my way to see much 
 of him till this year. I invited him to stop here 
 whenever he might happen to be in our neighbour- 
 hood, and I assure you his proposing to accept my 
 invitation in the way he has done, is a singularly gra- 
 cious compliment from him." 
 
 " I am not sufficiently conversant with all parts of the 
 Peerage," observed Captain Vernon, "to be aware what 
 may be Lord Stanmore's age." 
 
 " He is no longer in his premiere jeunesse," re- 
 plied Sir William, " yet he is not old enough to be 
 at all an unsuitable Husband for Emily. He is about 
 forty. He was always considered extremely good 
 looking, and there is a good deal of dignity in his 
 appearance and manner, which many people who do 
 not know him, have unjustly mistaken for hauteur."

 240 ADELAIDE. 
 
 u He has a very large fortune has he not ?" enquired 
 Arthur. 
 
 " Yes, his Estates are princely, — his Country House 
 is one of the finest Places in England, — and the fame 
 of these possessions, with the elegant addition of an 
 old Earldom, have for many years rendered his alli- 
 ance an eager object of ambition to all Fathers and 
 Mothers in a certain rank of society." 
 
 " I do not at all wonder," said Arthur, a that a 
 Person so richly gifted with every other worldly ad- 
 vantage, should wish for the blessing of a Wife ; and 
 still less am I surprised at the selection he now seems 
 likely to make. Circumstanced as he has been, I am 
 only astonished that he has not married sooner." 
 
 " I am not altogether sure," replied Sir William, 
 u that it was a want of susceptibility that has occa- 
 sioned his remaining so long single. I have formerly 
 heard some story of his having had an unhappy 
 attachment, — some early entanglement. I do not 
 exactly recollect the particulars, perhaps the whole 
 was an unfounded fabrication. At any rate it can be 
 of no consequence now, as the liason, if it ever did 
 exist, has for some time been entirely broken off. But

 ADELAIDE. 241 
 
 it grows late, — and 1 need not tell you that it is ne- 
 cessary to answer Lord Stanmore's letter by return of 
 post. When that is done, I think I must take pity 
 upon poor Julia's curiosity by informing her of the 
 approach of our Guest ; and as we must invite a Party 
 to meet him, we should lose no time in considering 
 who it will be most expedient to ask. Of course I 
 shall not even hint to my Daughters the hopes I have 
 been imparting to You. If our noble Visitor wishes 
 to find favour with Emily, he shall receive my joyful 
 consent to plead his own cause. But until I am 
 assured of his intentions, I will upon no account raise 
 expectations in her mind which may possibly never 
 be realized." 
 
 As soon as Sir William had retired to write his let- 
 ter and make his arrangements, Captain Vernon rushed 
 out of the house in a state bordering upon distrac- 
 tion. 
 
 The full consciousness of his unfortunate love for 
 Emily had only burst upon him by his having made 
 the fatal discovery that it was more than hopeless. 
 He shrunk with horror from the idea of having be-

 trayed the confidence reposed in him by his kind and 
 unsuspecting Uncle, and above all he shuddered to 
 think it possible he might have endangered the peace 
 of that beloved Cousin, to secure whose happiness he 
 would willingly have sacrificed his life. — He scarcely 
 ventured to ask himself if Emily returned his passion. 
 He sincerely hoped that she did not. Perhaps She 
 might always have regarded him in the same light 
 her Father had done, and consequently her affection 
 for him was simply that of a very near relation. But 
 a number of little circumstances crowded upon his 
 recollection, and contradicted the probability of such a 
 supposition. — He at once determined to exert every 
 effort he could devise in endeavouring to counteract 
 as far as it might yet be in his power, the mischief he 
 had unintentionally occasioned. 
 
 His first intention was to tear himself away as 
 speedily as possible from Greyfield, where he re- 
 solved that his presence should never again interfere 
 with any of his Uncle's prospects. But it was not 
 easy to know how to manage a retreat in such a way 
 as to avoid awakening Sir William's suspicions, and

 betraying to Emily his attachment. To propose go- 
 ing" away immediately would inevitably do both. 
 After long consideration, he therefore made up his 
 mind, to remain quietly where he was for a few days, 
 and then contrive some excuse for making a very 
 sudden departure, just before Lord Stanmore's ar- 
 rival. 
 
 For several hours he wandered about in the most 
 secluded part of the grounds, meditating upon his 
 wretchedness, and devising plans for his future con- 
 duct, — before he could regain sufficient composure to 
 return to the house and rejoin his Cousins. They 
 had been engaged with their Father, first in talking 
 over, and then in preparing to despatch their invita- 
 tions for the following week, and had consequently 
 missed Arthur much less than they would otherwise 
 have done. When he entered the Drawing Room, 
 Julia exclaimed, 
 
 " So you have come in at last ! What can you 
 have been doing with yourself all this time ?" And 
 he fancied that as she spoke, she regarded him with a 
 look of peculiar curiosity. 
 
 Q 2

## p. 244 (#266) ############################################


 
 244 ADELAIDE, 
 
 We have all been assembled in Council," she con- 
 tinued, " and have much wanted Your sage advice 
 to assist us in our deliberations." She then told him 
 that Lord Stanmore had written to her Father to 
 say that he was coming to Greyfield ; and run over 
 the names of all those who, as she expressed it, u had 
 been considered worthy of the distinguished honour 
 of being asked to meet such a high and mighty Per- 
 sonage as his Lordship." 
 
 Sir William had been half amused by Julia's mode 
 of beginning her description, but he was much more 
 than half angry at the ridicule she had attempted to 
 throw upon Lord Stanmore's character in her con- 
 clusion ; and he reproved her very severely for her evil 
 practice of talking nonsense, and never mentioning 
 any body but in a satirical and unamiable way. 
 
 During this discussion, Emily's colour had varied 
 frequently, but no other difference was perceptible 
 either in her appearance or her mariner. She did 
 not seem at all elated by the prospect of Lord Stan- 
 more's visit, indeed a Stranger might have concluded 
 that She looked forward to it with less interest of any 
 kind than either of the rest of the Party around her.

 The remainder of the time he spent at Greyfield, 
 was a period of constant trial to Captain Vernon, and 
 he could never afterwards recollect those miserable 
 days without a lively sensation of horror. He cau- 
 tiously guarded against making any visible difference 
 in his behaviour towards his Cousins, yet he endea- 
 voured indirectly to avoid finding himself tete a tete 
 with Emily. 
 
 When they happened to be thrown together, he 
 talked to her as usual about her various amusements 
 and pursuits, — but his embarrassment and distress were 
 much encreased by perceiving that she seemed to ob- 
 serve his conduct with a very watchful eye. 
 
 At those hours when the whole Family were as- 
 sembled, their expected Guests formed continually 
 the theme of their conversation. Poor Arthur at no 
 time found it an easy task to maintain that self-com- 
 mand which was requisite to enable him to act the 
 part he had prescribed to himself, with an appearance 
 of cheerfulness, gaiety, and unconcern ; — And there 
 were often moments when he had the greatest diffi- 
 culty in contriving to conceal his emotion.

## p. 246 (#268) ############################################


 
 246 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Two days before Lord Stanmore's arrival, Captain 
 Vernon told his Uncle, that in consequence of the ab- 
 sence of several other Officers, he had just received 
 an unpleasant Summons to rejoin his Regiment with- 
 out delay ; — And that so pressing an invitation would 
 oblige him to leave Grey field ^either that evening or 
 very early the following morning. 
 
 Sir William was very much concerned. " This is 
 the worst news," he said, u that I have heard for a 
 long while. I could very ill spare you, my dear Ar- 
 thur, at any time, but at the present moment I really 
 do not know what I can do without you." 
 
 Captain Vernon attempted to express his gratitude 
 for the kindness he had received since he had been 
 under his Uncle's roof, but Sir William would not 
 listen to any thing of this kind : — 
 
 " Nonsense, nonsense ;" cried he, " Your society 
 has given us all very sincere pleasure. I shall always 
 be delighted to have you with me, — so remember that 
 the best plan you can pursue will be to return here 
 as soon and as frequently as possible." 
 
 Poor Arthur was cut to the heart by this speech,

## p. 247 (#269) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 247 
 
 and was obliged to turn away his head to conceal 
 how much he was affected. 
 
 " Your Cousins," continued Sir William, " parti- 
 cularly your Friend Emily, will be in despair when 
 they hear of your departure." 
 
 " I must request you, my dear Uncle, " replied 
 Arthur, recovering himself, " to have the goodness 
 to tell them how suddenly I have been called away ; 
 for my notice is so short, that it is necessary I should 
 immediately set about the disagreable task of prepa- 
 ring for my journey. 
 
 I must in the first instance ride over to Oldthorpe 
 and endeavour to secure a place in the Coach, for to- 
 morrow morning." 
 
 " Will it not be as well if you send one of my Ser- 
 vants," said Sir William, " to execute that commis- 
 sion for you ?" 
 
 " You are very kind," answered Arthur, u but I 
 am afraid it will not, — for if I fail in my first object, 
 I must devise some other mode of travelling. I can 
 make all the requisite enquiries when I am upon the 
 spot. And if the Coaches do not suit my purpose, I

 You go to bed to-night, J shall set out upon my 
 journey." 
 
 " I believe you are right," concluded Sir William, 
 — u Every body's business is best executed by them- 
 selves. But still I grudge losing so much of your 
 company the last day that you are to be here." 
 
 Captain Vernon's arrangements at Oldthorpe were 
 speedily and satisfactorily accomplished, but he pur- 
 posely delayed his return, and made so long a circuit 
 in his way back, that he did not appear at Greyfield 
 until about an hour before dinner. — He did not dare 
 to look at Emily while She and her Sister were ex- 
 pressing their sorrow at the prospect of his unexpect- 
 ed departure ; But he perceived afterwards that she 
 was unusually pale, and that her eyes appeared as if 
 she had been weeping. 
 
 In the evening he found the two young Ladies 
 seated together at an open Window. Sir William 
 called Julia to remove her work which she had left 
 untidily scattered about upon the sofa : And while 
 she was occupied in collecting it, — Emily turned to-

 wards her Cousin and asked him if he intended to set 
 out very early the next morning ? 
 
 He told her he should probably be gone long be- 
 fore she would be awake. 
 
 Emily paused, as if intending to speak, — At length 
 she said, 
 
 u I have something to say to you, Arthur. — I wish 
 to thank you for all the benefits for which I am in- 
 debted to you. I feel that I am a very different per- 
 son now from what I was before I knew You. You 
 have taught me to discover my failings, and I also 
 hope to correct them ; — to perceive my own defi- 
 ciency, and to make those exertions which have led, I 
 trust, to improvement. For all this I shall have rea- 
 son to be most grateful to you as long as I live." 
 
 Captain Vernon was so completely overpowered, 
 that for a moment he was unable to make any answer. 
 
 " You know I have never nattered you, Emily," 
 replied he, u You will therefore believe me when I 
 tell you that the more I have seen of your character, 
 the more cause I have found to admire it. — When I 
 first came here, I own I observed that you did not do

 yourself justice, — I was anxious to make you under- 
 stand this, — and it will always be my greatest happi- 
 ness to think that you have allowed me to succeed. — 
 I ventured to point out to you the dormant energies 
 of your mind, — but the merit of immediately resolv- 
 ing to call them into action, and of employing them 
 as you have done, is entirely your own." 
 
 " I shall recollect all your advice," continued 
 Emily, " And frequently retrace our agreable con- 
 versations. — I wonder when and where we shall all 
 meet again ?" 
 
 " I fear a very long time must elapse," said Arthur, 
 " before I can return to the North. My next Leave 
 of Absence will of course he spent at home — with my 
 Father and Mother. There is a probability, too, of 
 my Regiment's being sent to the East Indies, but in 
 that case I should contrive to run down and see you 
 before my departure; I am very willing to go any 
 where, yet preparing for such a destination would 
 feel very like bidding adieu to England for a life-time. 
 It will be soon enough, however, to think of all this 
 when I am certain that it is actually to be my fate.

 In the common course of things, 1 may perhaps hope 
 to see you in two years, but even that is doubtful. 
 Many events may in the mean while happen to us 
 all ; — Before I visit Greyfield again, it is most pro- 
 bable that both You and Julia will be married." 
 
 " I do not believe that is very likely," observed 
 Emily, " at least as far as I am concerned." 
 
 And it was in a tone of reproach that she added, — 
 " It seems an ill luck that peculiarly attends our Family 
 to be injudicious and unhappy in our attachments." 
 
 As she concluded these words, she rose and left 
 the room ; When she came back, all traces of grief 
 and displeasure were banished from her countenance, 
 and site had assumed an affectation of gaiety and in- 
 difference that sat very uneasily upon her. 
 
 Out of consideration for his Nephew's rest, Sir Wil- 
 liam proposed that they should not sit up very late. 
 
 " You must frequently let us hear from you, Ar- 
 thur," said he, " I was never famous for being a very 
 good Correspondent myself, but I will promise to 
 write to you as often as I may have any particular 
 intelligence to communicate." 
 
 Julia showed much more feeling at parting with

 her Cousin than he had expected from her. Emily 
 evidently struggled hard to conceal her emotion, but 
 when she attempted to wish him a pleasant journey, 
 the words died upon her lips, and she burst into tears. 
 
 Captain Vernon's distress defied all description ! 
 He believed he had taken a last farewell of the be- 
 loved Object of his affection. He had just disco- 
 vered, (what under other circumstances would have 
 delighted him beyond expression,) that Emily was 
 tenderly attached to him. He had perceived, too, 
 that his conduct that evening had hurt and offended 
 her. This grieved him deeply, and yet thought he, 
 ' is it not the height of selfishness to regret a misun- 
 derstanding that may be the means of reconciling her 
 to the absence of a person she must now consider so 
 ungrateful, — and also of leading her to give a favor- 
 able reception to her Noble Admirer ?' 
 
 The agony of Arthur's feelings would not allow him 
 to sleep, — he heard the clock strike hour after hour, 
 till the night appeared to be perfectly endless, and it 
 was a great relief when the day light began at length 
 to peep through his windows, and his Servant came to 
 warn him that it was time to prepare for his journey.

 CHAP. XIV. 
 
 My Daughter cannot be thy Bride; 
 Not that the blush to Wooer dear, 
 Nor paleness that of maiden fear. 
 It may not be— forgive her, Chief." 
 
 Sir Walter Scott. 
 
 Sir George and Lady Fauconberg and Adelaide 
 were included among the Guests who had been in- 
 vited to Greyfield ; They, as well as many others of 
 the party, were much surprised to learn that Captain 
 Vernon was gone, but their attention was soon direct- 
 ed into another channel by perceiving Lord Stan- 
 more's very evident admiration of Miss Shirley. Sir 
 William's hopes encreased every hour, till they were 
 almost converted into certainty ; — And the day before 
 his Friends were expected to disperse, he was made 
 completely happy by Lord Stanmore's asking him for 
 an audience, and requesting in due form, his permis- 
 sion to make an offer of his hand to Miss Shirley.

## p. 254 (#276) ############################################


 
 254 ADELAIDE. 
 
 The request was granted with much satisfaction, 
 but in the joy and triumph of his heart, Sir William 
 determined to indulge himself in the pleasure of being 
 the first person to announce the good news to Emily. 
 
 He felt no surprise at perceiving she was extreme- 
 ly agitated during so interesting a communication; — 
 but it is impossible to describe his consternation and 
 astonishment, when she told him, after some hesita- 
 tion, that ' grateful as she should always feel to Lord 
 Stanmore for the high compliment he had paid her, 
 — she was not sufficiently dazzled by the brilliancy of 
 the prospect he thus held out to her, to have any wish 
 to accept an elevation, which by removing her from 
 her own natural sphere, could only place her in a 
 situation of splendid misery.' 
 
 Sir William gazed at his Daughter in silence. — 
 He could not believe that he had heard aright, and 
 was at first half tempted to suspect that Lord Stan- 
 more's proposal, by coming suddenly upon her, had 
 so bewildered her brain, that she had spoken without 
 being quite conscious of what she was saying. 
 
 But when Emily more firmly repeated that her

 ADELAIDE. 255 
 
 character had never been an ambitious one ; that she 
 desired no happiness beyond that of living at home 
 with her own Family as she had hitherto done ; and 
 earnestly requested he would allow her to decline the 
 very flattering offer of her Noble Admirer; — her 
 Father completely lost all patience, and could no 
 longer restrain a violent paroxysm of anger and dis- 
 appointment. 
 
 Sir William Shirley's passions were strong, but 
 they were not easily excited, and he permitted few 
 things to ruffle his naturally happy temper : Yet 
 when any extraordinary circumstance chanced to 
 arouse his resentment, the storm was as furious as it 
 was generally transient. — It was peculiarly so upon 
 the present occasion ; and Emily who had never seen 
 her Father so angry before, trembled with grief and 
 dismay when the tempest she had unintentionally 
 caused, burst suddenly upon her. 
 
 " Is this worse than foolish obstinacy," he ex- 
 claimed, " the return I am to receive for all my 
 affection, and solicitude for your welfare ? My anxi- 
 ous days, and sleepless nights! — You, who till this

 moment have been the pride and delight of my heart ; 
 Kow, whose supposed superiority of character, and 
 docility of temper, have consoled me for the wayward 
 failings of my other Children — have also at length 
 cruelly disappointed and deceived me. Wretched 
 Father that I am ! I once little thought it would be 
 my hard fate in my old age, to meet with ingratitude 
 and mortification from those from whom I might 
 have hoped to find support and comfort ! Had Julia 
 with mad perversity opposed herself to my wishes, 
 and shut her eyes against her own interest, it might 
 not perhaps have surprised me, — but from You, Emily, 
 I had expected very different conduct." 
 
 Emily threw herself at her Father's feet in an agony 
 of distress ; but when she attempted to take his hand, 
 he spurned her from him. 
 
 iC Rise, Miss Shirley," said he, " it is but mockery 
 to kneel before me when your undutiful folly is break- 
 ing my heart. I cannot bear to look upon you in my 
 present mood, and I warn you not to attempt again 
 to speak to me, or to force yourself into my presence 
 until the first keenness of my disappointment is abated."

 ADELAIDE. 257 
 
 Then as he was leaving the room, he paused, and 
 said, 
 
 " If you should happen to see Lord Stanmore be- 
 fore we meet again, it may be kind to shorten his 
 suspense, by informing him of your determination to 
 reject his suit. You are the proper person to perform 
 this ungracious task, — I assure you that I feel far too 
 much ashamed of you, and too deeply mortified about 
 the whole concern, to wish to undertake it." 
 
 Emily's eyes remained fixed upon the door, long 
 after her Father had closed it, — she was almost stu- 
 pified by the excess of her grief. She could scarcely 
 understand what had happened, but Sir William's 
 bitter reproaches rung in her ear, and his angry ges- 
 ture and the dreadful expression of his countenance 
 when he repulsed her humble supplications, still flit- 
 ted before her sight. 
 
 As the Baronet crossed the Hall in his way to his 
 own room, he met Lady Fauconberg; She came 
 upon him so suddenly, that it was impossible to avoid 
 her as he would willingly have done. The troubled 
 expression of his countenance, and the agitation of

 258 ADELAIDE. 
 
 his manner betrayed that something" extraordinary 
 had happened to him, and giving way to the impulse 
 of her curiosity, she exclaimed, 
 
 " Good Heavens, Sir William ! What can have 
 distressed You ? Has any thing dreadful occurred ?" 
 
 Sir William had a high opinion of Lady Faucon- 
 berg's sagacity and judgment in all worldly affairs : 
 He felt that he stood much in need of an able Coun- 
 sellor in his present difficulty; and he immediately 
 determined to confide to her what had passed between 
 him and Emily, and to ask her how she would advise 
 him to act under such perplexing circumstances ? 
 
 He therefore drew her ami within his, and request- 
 ed she would have the kindness to accompany him for 
 a few minutes to his Study ; an invitation which it is 
 needless to observe she was very happy to accept. 
 
 Sir William was still too much ruffled to be able to 
 tell his history very distinctly, but his Companion 
 easily understood it ; — and when it was concluded, 
 she assured him that ' nobody could enter more truly 
 into all his feelings than herself, since he was aware 
 that she had lately experienced a similar distress.'

 u You are a bad Comforter," replied Sir William, 
 u to remind me of a circumstance that can only en- 
 crease the measure of my own unhappiness." 
 
 a I mentioned it purposely," said Lady Faucon- 
 berg, " I wished to show you that your disappoint- 
 ment, severe as it is, is not a singular one ; And I 
 hoped to induce you to listen, as I have done, to the 
 pleading's of your own heart, — to relent, and forget 
 your anger against poor Emily. She and Adelaide 
 have both in one instance behaved most perverse- 
 ly and undutifully ; At all other times we have 
 found them every thing that Parents could wish or 
 desire. It is mortifying to discover, that those in 
 whom we have centered our pride and our affection, 
 are not exempt from human frailty ; but when we 
 recollect that we are liable to err ourselves, we should 
 not surely refuse to make some allowance for the 
 faults of our Children." 
 
 a That is all very true, — very just," answered Sir 
 William, thoughtfully, " And I believe I must for- 
 give my refractory Emily. Now that I consider the 
 matter over coolly, I am not sure that I ought to feel 
 
 r 2

 so very angry with her — because she is unwilling to 
 leave me." 
 
 " Yet," — continued he, after a pause, " I should 
 have been so proud and happy in seeing her so bril- 
 liantly married !" 
 
 " Emily's having rejected such an Alliance is 
 certainly a cruel mortification," said Lady Faucon- 
 berg. " She who seems intended by nature, as well 
 as fitted by education, to be an ornament to Society, 
 to adorn a situation of rank and consequence—" 
 
 " Stop, stop," exclaimed Sir William, " if you do 
 not intend to drive me mad again." 
 
 Then looking wildly at Lady Fauconberg, he con- 
 tinued, 
 
 u What can be the reason of Emily's opposing 
 herself so obstinately to this marriage ? She does 
 not pretend to dislike Lord Stanmore. — There must 
 be something in all this that I am unable to compre- 
 hend." 
 
 " You look at me," replied Lady Fauconberg, "as 
 if you fancied I was your Daughter's Confidant, which 
 I can truly assure you I have never been. And yet

 ADELAIDE. 261 
 
 I might perhaps form a shrewd conjecture, — indeed I 
 suspect that all those who have been much at Grey- 
 field lately, might be able to guess the cause of Emily's 
 present objection to Matrimony." 
 
 Sir William started from his seat. " Speak more 
 plainly, for the love of Heaven !" cried he, " Do not 
 let me continue longer in this horrible suspense." 
 
 " The task you impose upon me," answered Lady 
 Fauconberg, with some hesitation, " is both a pain- 
 ful and a thankless one ; yet, after having gone so 
 far, I feel I ought not to shrink from concluding it. — 
 Your Nephew Captain Vernon formed for many 
 weeks a Member of your Family Party, — had he 
 not remained with you so long, do you imagine that 
 your Daughter would have entertained the horror she 
 now expresses at the idea of becoming a Countess ?" 
 
 " What can Arthur's visit have to do with Emily's 
 rejection of Lord Stanmore ?" said the Baronet im- 
 patiently, — then starting violently as if some sudden 
 light had burst upon his mind, he sat down and drew 
 his hand across his brow. It was some time before 
 he spoke, at length he exclaimed, —

 26'2 ADELAIDE. 
 
 u I begin to understand you too well. I see the 
 whole truth now. I perceive, when it is too late, 
 what a blinded fool I have been : And the discovery 
 is in every way so grievous that I could almost wish 
 you had left me in my ignorance. Oh, Lady Fau- 
 conberg, if you were aware of what was going for- 
 ward, why did you not give me a friendly warning ? 
 An earlier hint from You, might have averted the 
 mischief.'' 
 
 " My dear Sir William, an instant's reflection will 
 show you that it was impossible for me to speak to 
 you upon so very delicate a subject. What right had 
 I to pry into your family secrets, or to intrude my 
 advice about your private concerns? I was not in 
 your confidence. I saw you treat your Nephew with 
 the affection of a Father ; I believed him to be a 
 most excellent and amiable Young Man : and though 
 his circumstances and prospects in life did not cer- 
 tainly render him such a Husband as I imagined your 
 wishes would have selected for Emily, — I did not 
 know that you might not after all be induced to re- 
 ceive him as a Son-in-Law."

## p. 263 (#285) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 263 
 
 u Never," said Sir William, resolutely. " I never 
 will allow my Daughter to marry any Man whose 
 fortune does not enable him to maintain her in the 
 style she has been accustomed to live in, and to pro- 
 cure for her, without inconvenience, those luxuries 
 and indulgences which habit has rendered necessary 
 to her comfort; — Even though he might personally 
 possess every virtue under the Sun, and boast the 
 additional merit of being my Nephew." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg could not fail to applaud sentiments 
 so congenial to her own, and the Baronet continued, — 
 
 " The ungrateful Viper whom I have fostered in 
 my bosom, has indeed contrived to frustrate my dear- 
 est hopes, and to destroy my peace ; but he will find 
 himself bitterly disappointed if he expects to persuade 
 me to bestow Emily's hand upon him, as the reward 
 of his treacherous villany.'' 
 
 As Lady Fauconberg had no interest in exaspe- 
 rating Sir William against his Nephew, she kindly 
 and prudently determined to endeavour to moderate 
 those angry feelings towards him which her commu- 
 nication had excited.

 264 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " I am not at all surprised," said she, " that you 
 should at this moment feel great resentment against 
 Captain Vernon; nothing can be more natural; — ■ 
 but are you certain that he has really behaved quite 
 as unworthily as you suppose him to have done ? You 
 would not I am sure willingly condemn him unjustly. 
 — From all I have ever seen and heard of Arthur, I 
 have hitherto considered his character to be pecu- 
 liarly upright and honourable, and though I do not 
 pretend to say that his conduct has not been very 
 blameable, I am still inclined to think him utterly 
 incapable of being guilty of the premeditated treachery 
 you impute to him. During his sejour here, he found 
 himself constantly in the society of his beautiful and 
 charming Cousin, — accident, or perhaps sympathy 
 seemed to bring them always together, and such 
 companionship was naturally dangerous to both. 
 The circumstance of their being so nearly related, 
 might conceal from them that it was so ; and it is 
 very possible that a mutual attachment might grow 
 up between them by such insensible degrees, that 
 neither of them might be aware of the nature of their

 ADELAIDE. 265 
 
 own sentiments. — How far Emily may have learnt 
 to understand her feelings towards Captain Vernon, I 
 am not able to determine ; but that he has somehow 
 discovered the warmth of his passion for her, and also 
 that he looks upon it as hopeless, appears very evi- 
 dent to me from the fact of his having left Greyfield, 
 and if I mistake not, very suddenly ; just before Lord 
 Stanmore's arrival." 
 
 " How very clear every thing is to my apprehension 
 now," observed Sir William, as if talking to himself. 
 
 " I well recollect, though I paid very little attention 
 to it at the time, that when I first told him I expect- 
 ed a visit from Lord Stanmore, and threw out some 
 hints about the Earl's admiration of Emily, Arthur 
 looked extremely agitated; he expressed greater 
 astonishment than I thought the communication quite 
 required, and he contrived to absent himself from the 
 House during the rest of the morning. The pe- 
 remptory Order to join his Regiment, which he after- 
 wards pretended to have received, was evidently an 
 excuse he invented to enable him to get away before 
 
 the approach of his Rival."

 266 ADELAIDE. 
 
 As if addressing himself more directly to Lady 
 Fauconberg, the Baronet after a pause, continued, — 
 
 a I see you are determined not to allow me the 
 poor satisfaction of being" very angry with any body 
 but myself. You have nearly succeeded in proving 
 to me that / am the only person who deserves to be 
 blamed for all the mischief that has occurred. Well, 
 be it so ; the punishment has fallen upon my own 
 head, and I am very willing to discover that I have 
 been a Fool, since it saves me the far more bitter 
 grief and mortification of believing my Nephew to 
 have been a Villain. — But Lord Stanmore must soon 
 be informed that Emily is resolved to decline the hand 
 he has told me it is his intention to offer to her. In what 
 terms do you advise me to convey to him her refusal ?" 
 
 It was several moments before Lady Fauconberg 
 answered this question, she seemed to be revolving 
 something in her mind which she did not quite like 
 to commit herself by expressing; at length she en- 
 quired in a half hesitating manner, c if it was abso- 
 lutely necessary that the refusal should be reported to 
 him at all?'

## p. 267 (#289) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 267 
 
 " Unquestionably it is," replied Sir William. " I 
 feel myself perfectly jus lined in saying that 1 would 
 refuse to allow my Daughter to form an alliance I 
 had reason to think n^ht prove detrimental to her 
 happiness ; but surely you do not imagine me capa- 
 ble of the unprincipled cruelty of compelling her to 
 marry a Man she cannot love, however desirable such 
 a marriage might appear to me." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg coloured, looked confused, and 
 answered hastily, " of course I could not wish to re- 
 commend you to act so harshly. All I intended to 
 insinuate was the possibility of contriving to satisfy 
 Lord Stanmore without giving him a decided answer 
 just at present ; and thus gaining time to overcome 
 Emily's objections, and persuade her freely to consent 
 to make him happy." 
 
 " No," said Sir William, " Lord Stanmore has 
 behaved openly and honourably towards me, and no 
 temptation shall induce me to deceive him." Then 
 perceiving the cloud of shame and anger which Lady 
 Fauconberg was unable to conceal, he feared he had 
 offended her, and added in a softened tone, —

 " Forgive me, Lady Fauconberg. I am just in 
 that unhappy state of mind that renders me inclined 
 to quarrel with the best and kindest advice. You 
 must not desert me when I stand more than ever in 
 need of your friendly counsel and direction." 
 
 Her Ladyship expressed herself propitiated, yet 
 she observed rather dryly, " that since all prospect of 
 the connection with the Earl was at an end, the only 
 course Sir William could pursue, was to break to him 
 as speedily and as delicately as possible, a disappoint- 
 ment he probably very little expected. — His pride 
 will be deeply hurt," continued she, " but I conclude 
 you intend to spare him the mortification of suppo- 
 sing that the repulse he has met with is known or sus- 
 pected by any one out of your own family." 
 
 " Certainly such is my wish, and I am sure it will 
 be Emily's also." 
 
 " Then let me entreat you," said Lady Fauconberg, 
 " to clear your brow, compose your spirits, and pre- 
 pare yourself as soon as may be, to speak pardon and 
 comfort to your Daughter. This will enable you, 
 when your unpleasant interview with Lord Stanmore

 is once over, to rejoin your other Guests with an air 
 of unconcern. Should they perceive any unusual traces 
 of agitation either in your appearance or in Emily's, 
 the whole secret will inevitably be discovered." 
 
 " True," replied SirWilliam, " I had not considered 
 that. I will go immediately to poor Emily." 
 
 " It will be much wiser," pursued her Ladyship, 
 u to conceal from her that you know, or even that you 
 suspect the motive that induces her to reject the alli- 
 ance that has been offered to her. — She will not see 
 her Cousin again for a long time, she will probably 
 hear very little about him, and her attachment if not 
 revived, will in time die a natural death ; — the very 
 absence of all opposition will of itself weaken its force. 
 Do not allow yourself to consider Lord Stanmore, — 
 exalted as he is, as the only great and desirable 
 Partie in the world, — believe me there is no danger 
 of Emily's not having many other eligible Admirers." 
 
 Sir William warmly expressed his obligation to 
 Lady Fauconberg, for the kind interest she had taken 
 in his distress, and also for the excellent advice she 
 had given him. As he was leaving the room, she

 enquired if Julia had been present during his conver- 
 sation with her Sister ? 
 
 The Baronet told her she had not ; and observed, 
 1 that as Julia was so very indiscreet, it was much 
 better she should know nothing of what had passed, — 
 at least not till after Lord Stanmore and the rest of 
 the Party were gone.' 
 
 " I cannot quite agree with you," said Lady Fau- 
 conberg, " indifferent people may indeed easily be 
 blinded, but Julia is far too acute not to perceive that 
 some extraordinary circumstance has been in agita- 
 tion. In my opinion, if you do not seal her lips by 
 confiding to her the truth, she will be most likely to 
 discover herself, and to betray to every body else, all 
 that has been going forward. — Time presses, and you 
 have much upon your hands. Shall I undertake to 
 speak to her upon this subject ? Her being found 
 tete a tete with me could appear remarkable to no- 
 body, but it might seem strange if it was observed 
 that you were closetted for any length of time first 
 with one of your Daughters and then with the other, 
 not to mention your interviews with Lord Stanmore.' ,

 Sir William thankfully accepted Lady Faucon- 
 berg's offer of communicating the events of the morn- 
 ing to Julia, earnestly requesting she would deeply 
 impress upon his giddy Daughter's mind the abso- 
 lute necessity of silence and extreme circumspection, 
 —particularly during the next four and twenty hours. 
 
 Her Ladyship, who was not a little proud of having 
 been selected as Sir William's Confidant upon so in- 
 teresting an occasion, — hurried away to perform a 
 commission very congenial to her intrigueing temper ; 
 — While the Baronet returned to the room where he 
 had left the unhappy Emily. 
 
 He found her still plunged in a state of the deepest 
 grief and distress. She rose at his entrance, and ad- 
 vanced towards him, but she did not venture to look 
 up in his face, while she expressed an anxious hope 
 that he would now permit her to plead to him for 
 forgiveness. As an earnest of the sincerity of her re- 
 pentance for her former unditiful behaviour, she said 
 that i she was ready willingly to give her hand to 
 Lord Stanmore, if her proposed acquiescence was not 
 yet too late.'

 Sir William raised his penitent Daughter, and 
 kissed her affectionately, as he replied, — 
 
 u No, Emily, this is too much. I cannot require 
 from you such a sacrifice, though I feel much obliged 
 to you for proposing to agree to it. I was very angry 
 with you when we parted, but I have now learnt to 
 look more calmly upon a disappointment I shall long 
 regret. — Do not weep so bitterly. I am sorry to 
 perceive that my former harsh expressions have af- 
 fected you much more deeply than I intended them 
 to do. Every thing that has passed, is pardoned and 
 forgotten. This evening I shall speak to Lord Stan- 
 more, — to-morrow morning he leaves Greyfield, — 
 and after his departure I promise you this unpleasant 
 topic shall never be revived." 
 
 Emily's gratitude for her Father's kindness was 
 almost as overpowering as her anguish had before 
 been. Sir William, after having endeavoured in vain 
 to restore her composure, at length determined to try 
 the effect of recalling her thoughts to their former 
 train. 
 
 " My dear Emily," said he, " there is one circum-

 stance I believe I forgot to impress upon your mind. 
 I have allowed you to decline the proposal of an un- 
 exceptionable Admirer, merely because he did not 
 please your fancy ; but I warn you, that should the 
 prospect of a similar Alliance again present itself, you 
 must not expect that I shall consent to humour you a 
 second time as readily as I have done the first." 
 
 This admonition acted powerfully upon Miss Shir- 
 ley ; It appeared to awaken her as if from a dream, 
 but there seemed to be something upon her mind 
 which she was at once desirous and unwilling to dis- 
 close. At last, she said, 
 
 " I should be very unworthy of your great kindness 
 and indulgence, my dear Papa, if I attempted longer 
 to conceal from you an unfortunate secret. I am de- 
 termined to tell you the whole truth, however painful 
 and humiliating the confession may be to myself. — 
 You believe that I refused to listen to Lord Stan- 
 more's proposal from a fancied dislike to the Person 
 who made it. — Alas ! You little suspect that the real 
 cause of my obstinacy this morning, was a foolish, 
 and as I have every reason to think, an unrequited — 
 attachment, to — Arthur Vernon.''

 Sir William's feelings were gratified by the open 
 confidence of this avowal, and it likewise relieved him 
 from any doubts he might still have entertained 
 respecting the integrity of his Nephew's conduct. 
 
 " Emily," replied he, " it has always been my 
 pride to think that You never had any secrets from 
 your Father. You have acted with your usual kind- 
 ness and propriety in confiding to me a circumstance 
 I should not myself have discovered, and I shall not 
 fail to remember with satisfaction and gratitude this 
 proof of your affection ; I am aware that the disclo- 
 sure must have been a painful one to You. It is also 
 grievous to me in very many ways ; And you must 
 be sensible that it cuts off the possibility of our hoping 
 to have any personal intercourse with my Nephew in 
 future. — But let us for the present" continued he, 
 after a pause, u endeavour to banish all disagreable 
 recollections from our minds. Our Guests will won- 
 der what is become of us. I will find some excuse 
 for your not appearing till we assemble before dinner, 
 — but I request of you as a particular favour that 
 you will then join us with an unruffled countenance, 
 and do the honours of the house for the rest of the

 evening with your accustomed attention and cheer- 
 fulness." 
 
 Emily saw the necessity of obeying her Father's 
 injunction, and she promised to make every possible 
 exertion to do so ; but she found that in the present ex- 
 cited state of her feelings, this would be no easy task. 
 
 She had not been very long- alone when she was 
 joined by her Sister. — Julia, with all her wayward 
 follies, was sincerely and tenderly attached to Emily ; 
 and perhaps she could give no stronger proof of this, 
 than her conduct upon the present occasion afforded. 
 Her manner towards her was peculiarly kind and 
 gentle, she had evidently been informed of every 
 thing that had occurred, yet she delicately avoided 
 making any direct allusion to a painful subject, and 
 while she refrained from indulging herself by one 
 satirical remark at the expense of any body, she play- 
 fully endeavoured to divert Emily's thoughts from 
 dwelling upon what had passed. 
 
 Miss Shirley was much touched by an affectionate 
 consideration so foreign to her Sister's usual charac- 
 ter. It was a relief to her to impart and to talk over 
 
 s2

 with Julia the thoughts that occupied her mind ; by 
 degrees the agitation of her Spirits began to subside, 
 and when Adelaide peeped into the room, unconscious 
 of what had been going forward, and asked if either 
 or both of her Friends felt inclined to go out walking ? 
 Emily expressed no reluctance in complying with the 
 invitation which Julia instantly accepted for her as 
 well as for herself. 
 
 Sir William Shirley expected that Lord Stanmore 
 would be deeply offended by his Daughter's refusal, 
 but in this he was mistaken. The Earl was indeed 
 excessively astonished and disappointed at meeting 
 with a repulse he had not imagined it possible he 
 ever could have experienced, — but his pride would 
 not allow him to confess himself sufficiently mortified 
 to be angry. In spite of the pique he felt against 
 Emily, he was much struck with the Spirit, and dis- 
 interested Character she had evinced in resolutely 
 declining an Alliance that had been long and anxious- 
 ly courted by persons of the highest rank and distinc- 
 tion. Perhaps, too, some vague hints which her 
 Father had thrown out about a previous attachment,

 ADELAIDE. 277 
 
 had touched a string connected with former recollec- 
 tions of his own. In short, by a strange species of 
 contradiction, his admiration of Miss Shirley was 
 encreased rather than diminished by Sir William's 
 communication, and he requested him to tell her 
 " that although he had not been fortunate enough to 
 be able to inspire her with a more tender sentiment, 
 he trusted he should at least always have the happi- 
 ness of possessing her regard and esteem." 
 
 The Baronet was much relieved by the way in 
 which Lord Stanmore received his disappointment : 
 He was also glad to find that he might still retain him 
 as a Friend. Lady Fauconberg upon far slighter 
 encouragement would have founded sanguine hopes 
 of the possibility of his yet becoming a Son-in-Law, 
 and her intrigueing spirit would have devised a thou- 
 sand schemes to facilitate and bring about such a 
 connexion. 
 
 But she would not have succeeded. — Lord Stan- 
 more's nature was much too haughty ever to allow 
 him to think of sueing a second time to any young- 
 Lady who had once refused him. His present idea

 of Emily's superiority was heightened by the contrast 
 her conduct formed to that of his other Acquaintance. 
 — Had he supposed that she had acted from no mo- 
 tive but caprice, he would have despised her, — And 
 had he believed her capable of changing her mind 
 and being persuaded to accept him if he proposed to 
 her again, he would have considered her degraded 
 into a very common-place, every day character. 
 
 For some time after the dispersion of the party at 
 Greyfield, no event of any importance occurred there. 
 The constant cheerfulness of Emily's manner and her 
 amiable attentions to her Father, soon reconciled him 
 to the idea of retaining the society of such a Com- 
 panion. 
 
 At first her gaiety was merely assumed, and it 
 often cost her a painful effort : — Yet she felt a happy 
 consciousness that she was doing her duty, and she 
 endeavoured as much as possible to banish all tender 
 recollections of her Cousin from her mind, — to forget 
 what she now considered a culpable weakness, — and 
 to think of him only as a Friend and Relation, whose 
 admonitions and directions she might still be permit-

 ted to look up to with admiration, and to follow with 
 advantage. 
 
 Sir William Shirley received a short and hasty 
 Letter from his Nephew, written immediately upon 
 his rejoining his Regiment; he also heard from him 
 occasionally afterwards, but he complained that his 
 Country Quarters afforded so little news, he was 
 afraid his despatches were scarcely worth their 
 postage. 
 
 They did not indeed appear to be very highly va- 
 lued by the Person to whom they were addressed, for 
 many weeks had elapsed and not one line had been 
 sent him in return, either by his Uncle or by any of 
 his Relations at Greyfield. He had began to give up 
 all hopes of ever hearing from them again, when he 
 was agreably surprised by the sight of a Letter from 
 his Cousin Julia, the last of the Family from whom 
 he would have expected such a mark of favour. It 
 was written in the wild, satirical style that suited her 
 character ; yet, under an affectation of thoughtless- 
 ness and irony, it was so contrived as to satisfy his 
 curiosity upon every point that was most interesting

 to him; and so grateful did he feel to Julia for this 
 kind consideration towards him, that his conscience 
 reproached him for having formerly judged her too 
 severely. 
 
 She told him that ' as her Elders and Betters did 
 not seem inclined to write to him, she thought it 
 would be but charity in her to relieve the anxiety he 
 must naturally feel, by informing him that much as 
 he had been missed by every one at Greyfield, nobody 
 had actually died of grief at his departure.' — She said 
 6 she supposed he would expect her to give him a long 
 description of Lord Stanmore's Visit, the great Event 
 that was so eagerly expected when he left them ; but 
 as that Visit was now an Old Story, and had proved 
 at the time rather a failure, — in other words, had not 
 turned out quite as it had been intended it should 
 have done ; — -She should perhaps be wiser if she men- 
 tioned it as slightly as possible.' — She complained of 
 having led a very hum drum life at home lately ; 
 observed that her Brother was not yet returned from 
 the North : that Emily and Adelaide Fauconberg 
 had become greater Friends than ever; — that they

 had so many resources in themselves, and could al- 
 ways find so much to occupy their minds, — that she 
 believed they could submit, without the least regret, 
 to the loss of what the world called gaiety. But 
 that She, who was more dependent upon Society for 
 amusement, had often felt herself in great danger of 
 being bored to death. That she had even sometimes 
 attempted, incredible as it might sound, — to make 
 serious reflections upon what was passing around her, 
 but that such an effort had generally afforded her 
 mortification rather than entertainment. ' Par exemple? 
 she told him, ' she had that very morning been medi- 
 tating philosophically upon the absurdities and con- 
 tradictions all her wisest Friends had allowed them- 
 selves to be betrayed into in their Love Affairs. — 
 Her Brother William, who was looked up to as to an 
 Oracle of Genius and Information by all the world, — 
 had not possessed sufficient discernment to discover 
 that he was disliked by the Object of his affections. 
 He had consequently, — (if she was not very much 
 mistaken,) subjected himself to the humiliation of 
 being twice rejected by the same fair Lady : and he 
 was now breaking his heart and exiling himself from

 his home because he despaired of being able to per- 
 suade her to lend a more favorable ear to his petition 
 if he were to fall down upon his knees and present it 
 to her a third time. — Adelaide Fauconberg, who was 
 admired by every body who knew her as a pattern 
 of all that was sensible, discreet, and excellent, had 
 obstinately persisted in refusing a Suitor who was 
 devotedly attached to her, because she happened to 
 have taken a fancy to another Person, — a Hero, who 
 seemed to care very little for her in return, — a Man, 
 too, whom she was perfectly aware her Mother would 
 never allow her to marry, even if He wished her to 
 do so. — Her Sister Emily, whom he would perhaps 
 agree with her in considering more perfectly gentle, 
 docile, and amiable than either of the others ; — whose 
 taste and judgment upon all former occasions had 
 been deservedly applauded; — had been foolish and 
 vulgar enough not to appreciate the exalted merits of 
 the brightest ornament of the Peerage, and had actu- 
 ally declined accepting a Coronet, without pretending 
 to assign any reason for doing so. — She added that 
 nothing but the fear of exhausting his patience, pre- 
 vented her from commenting upon similar acts of

 weakness, and led her to spare the rest of her Rela- 
 tions till some future opportunity. She said that Love 
 appeared to her to be so very wayward a passion, 
 that she often wondered how it happened she had 
 never fallen in love herself. But perhaps in her case 
 the effect might be different, she might behave rea- 
 sonably, wisely, and consistently under its influence ; 
 for in all the instances that had come beneath her ob- 
 servation, it had impelled its Victims to act in direct 
 contradiction to their own natural characters.' 
 
 She concluded her Letter by earnestly requesting 
 her Cousin to take no notice of having" received it. 
 6 His attempting to thank her for it,' she said, ' could 
 only bring her into troubled Waters. Her Father 
 might not approve of her writing to a Young Man^ 
 even though he was so near a Relation as a first 
 Cousin. And her Sister, though she had not thought 
 fit to correspond with him herself, might feel a little 
 jealous of her having presumed to do so : — Indeed as 
 she suspected it was not altogether quite a proper 
 proceeding upon her part, she had no intention of 
 ever favouring him with another Epistle.'

 This curious Letter, while it gave Captain Vernon 
 great pain, afforded him at the same time a ray of 
 satisfaction. He was very sincerely sorry to learn 
 that Emily had relinquished a brilliant Alliance for 
 his sake, yet he could not help feeling much gratified 
 by the attachment that had prompted her to make 
 such a sacrifice. And although it grieved him to 
 think he had been instrumental in thwarting any wish 
 of his Uncle's, he found it scarcely possible to regret 
 that Sir William had not succeeded in bestowing his 
 Daughter upon a Husband, who, with all his worldly 
 advantages, seemed a person but little calculated to 
 ensure her happiness. 
 
 Arthur had no desire, circumstanced as he now was, 
 to attempt to renew more than a casual communica- 
 tion with Greyfield. He applied himself more dili- 
 gently than ever to the duties of his Profession, and 
 he endeavoured amid the numerous and constant oc- 
 cupations that engrossed his present hours, at once to 
 banish all distressing recollections of the past, and to 
 shut his eyes against any discouraging anticipations 
 of the future.

 The Friendship between Adelaide and Emily, which 
 recent circumstances had so strongly cemented, proved 
 a source of much pleasure and comfort to them both. 
 It is needless to observe that the change that had been 
 effected in Miss Shirley's character, had rendered her 
 a far more agreable Companion ; and it had also 
 taught her to appreciate the society of such a Friend 
 as Adelaide. Perhaps too, though neither of them 
 ever touched upon so delicate a subject, a sympathy 
 of feeling and a similarity of situation, had contributed 
 to draw them more closely together. Emily was of 
 course well aware that an unfortunate attachment had 
 induced Miss Fauconberg to refuse to become her

 Sister-in-Law. And Adelaide, though she had never 
 been told that Miss Shirley had actually rejected Lord 
 Stanmore, had seen enough of the progress of his at- 
 tentions to her, to be able to guess the cause of their 
 sudden termination : and even had she entertained 
 any doubts upon this point, Julia's broad hints would 
 have entirely removed them. 
 
 Mr. Shirley's return was delayed from time to time, 
 and Adelaide could not help fearing that he staid 
 away from home upon her account. Could she have 
 persuaded herself that he remained in Scotland merely 
 because he was better amused there than he would 
 have been at Greyfield, she would have been inclined 
 personally to rejoice at the length of his absence. 
 
 Of Colonel Algernon she had heard nothing either 
 directly or indirectly ; her Father and Mother never 
 mentioned his name in her presence, though both of 
 them, from different motives, felt extremely curious 
 to know what was become of him. 
 
 There was a small Estate which bordered upon 
 Fauconberg and Greyfield, and from its peculiar si- 
 tuation would have formed a very desirable addition

 ADELAIDE. 287 
 
 to each. Both the Neighbours had formerly been 
 extremely anxious to become possessed of it, and a 
 sort of amicable rivalship had subsisted between them 
 upon the subject, but neither had proved successful 
 enough to obtain the prize. 
 
 The Estate then belonged to Mrs. Algernon's 
 Father, a whimsical old Man, who could never be 
 prevailed upon to part with it, — though it had not 
 been very long in his Family, and was widely sepa- 
 rated from all his other Property. At his death he 
 left all his Lands so strictly tied up, that his successor 
 was unable to alienate any portion of them, and the 
 two Baronets finding their pursuit hopeless, had long- 
 given up even thinking of it. 
 
 When Horace Algernon came of age, however, 
 his Mother had the power of cutting off the Entail. 
 His extravagant habits obliged him to have frequent 
 recourse to Lord Altamont's liberality, and as the old 
 Peer began at length to talk of the necessity of limi- 
 ting his supplies, — Mrs. Algernon proposed to her 
 Son to join with her in a measure that would give her 
 the means of assisting him in his difficulties. Horace

 288 ADELAIDE. 
 
 at first refused to do this, but when his embarrass- 
 ments had encreased and his resources had diminished, 
 the temptation became too great to be resisted. He 
 consented to avail himself of his Mother's kindness, — 
 And just before he last left England, a Deed had been 
 executed in the regular form, which released Mrs. 
 Algernon's Estates from the restrictions her Father 
 had annexed to them, and placed them entirely at her 
 own disposal. Lord Altamont's generosity prevented 
 the necessity of his Daughter-in-Law's making any 
 pecuniary sacrifice at that time ; but multiplied ex- 
 penses and an unusual run of bad luck at play, had 
 latterly reduced Horace to the greatest distress. His 
 Grandfather wrote him word that a specified sum 
 should be immediately transmitted to him, but that 
 beyond that amount he could not conscientiously afford 
 to relieve him. The remittance, large as it was, 
 proving insufficient to discharge even his most pres- 
 sing debts, he was obliged to have recourse to his 
 Mother, and he earnestly requested she would con- 
 trive to advance him, as speedily as possible, a sum of 
 money by way of a Loan, which he hoped it would 
 before very long be in his power to repay.

 ADELAIDE. 289 
 
 Mrs. Algernon instantly determined to sell her 
 Northern Estate, and to despatch part of the money 
 she received for it, abroad ; but as she felt half 
 ashamed of this act of weak indulgence, she told 
 Lord Altamont — " She found property situated at 
 such a distance, so troublesome to manage, that she 
 thought it would answer much better to her to part 
 with it, and to place the sum it might produce, in the 
 Funds." 
 
 Lord Altamont shook his head, as he observed, that 
 ft She was certainly the best judge of what related to 
 the management of her own concerns ; but that had 
 she consulted him upon the subject, he should strenu- 
 ously have advised her to retain her Estate, and upon 
 no consideration to send the produce of her good Eng- 
 lish Acres to be squandered away in a Foreign 
 Land." 
 
 This remonstrance, of course, produced no effect, 
 and the sale of the Lands being decided upon, nothing 
 remained but to take the proper steps to find a pur- 
 chaser. 
 
 It happened that the day Henry Algernon had

 290 ADELAIDE. 
 
 dined at Fauconberg Manor, he had passed close to 
 the Estate in question in the course of the circuit he 
 made in his ride with Sir George and Adelaide. The 
 Baronet had then pointed out to him some Meadows, 
 skirted by a little Wood, and had remarked that 
 ' those Fields were the property of a Relation of his, 
 that they belonged to Mrs. Algernon ;' and he added, 
 in a joking way, ' that if ever she should feel dis- 
 posed to part with them, he hoped the Colonel would 
 use his influence with his Aunt to persuade her to 
 allow him to have the first refusal of them." Henry 
 was not then even aware of the circumstance of Mrs. 
 Algernon's having any property in that neighbour- 
 hood, — but he promised to exert all his eloquence in 
 Sir George's behalf should an opportunity occur to 
 enable him to do so with a prospect of success, — And 
 he did not now forget to fulfil his engagement. 
 
 He wrote to Sir George to remind him of their 
 former conversation, and to tell him that the Estate 
 he had expressed a desire to obtain, was about to be 
 sold. He said that some rumour of Mrs. Algernon's 
 intention having reached the North, she had already

 ADELAIDE. 291 
 
 received a very advantageous offer for the property 
 from a person whom she had reason to believe was 
 an Agent employed by Sir William Shirley ; hut 
 that she had been kind enough, in compliance with 
 a request from himself, to decline giving any decided 
 reply to this application, until after the answer had 
 arrived to the Letter she had now empowered him to 
 despatch to Fauconberg Manor. 
 
 This communication surprised Sir George conside- 
 rably. He had not heard a word of the intended 
 Sale. He had entirely forgotten his conversation 
 with Colonel Algernon until it was thus unexpectedly 
 recalled to his mind. And he could not help thinking 
 it very extraordinary that he should receive such a 
 mark of kind and delicate attention from a Young 
 Man who had for many months appeared desirous to 
 avoid every opportunity of continuing even his ac- 
 quaintance. Indeed this seeming contradiction struck 
 him so forcibly, that it revived the doubts Adelaide's de- 
 fence had before suggested, and led him again to suspect 
 that he had been betrayed a second time into forming 
 an erroneous opinion of Colonel Algernon's character.

 He explained to his Daughter the overture he had 
 received from Mrs. Algernon ; told her to whom he 
 was indebted for it, — and putting the Colonel's Letter 
 into her hands, desired her to read it and give him 
 her opinion of it. 
 
 Adelaide's varying colour and quivering lip be- 
 tra}'ed her emotion during the perusal ; when it was 
 finished, she observed ' that Colonel Algernon's beha- 
 viour in this business had been exactly such as she 
 should have expected from him.' 
 
 u I cannot say the same thing," replied Sir George, 
 u for it has astonished me much. His writing to me 
 in the way he has done, is under all circumstances, 
 either a proof of the most considerate recollection and 
 kindness, or an instance of unparalleled and shame- 
 less assurance. If I believed it to be the latter, I 
 need not add that no consideration of interest or ad- 
 vantage, however alluring, — should induce me to ac- 
 cept any favour through his intercession." 
 
 " Since you have required me to give you my 
 opinion upon this subject," said Adelaide, " I will 
 venture to affirm that if you attribute Colonel Alger-

 disinterested motives, I am convinced you will do him 
 much wrong. It would be a great pity to lose the 
 opportunity of purchasing a desirable Estate, by he- 
 sitating to avail yourself of his good offices ; let me 
 request you to accept them, and I think I dare almost 
 undertake to be your Surety that you will never find 
 reason to repent having done so." 
 
 " Upon my word you speak very confidently, Ade- 
 laide," continued Sir George. u I have no desire to 
 distress you by extorting explanations you may not be 
 at liberty to give, but before I can decide upon the 
 weight I am to attach to your assurances, you must 
 answer me one plain question. Are they founde 1 
 merely upon your own good opinion and general 
 knowledge of Colonel Algernon's character, or are 
 they warranted by an acquaintance with peculiar cir- 
 cumstances which have not been revealed to me ?" 
 
 Miss Fauconberg hesitated an instant between her 
 desire to vindicate Colonel Algernon and her fear of 
 compromising her Mother. She thought there could 
 be no danger of doing the latter if she replied M that

 the persuasion she had expressed of Colonel Alger- 
 non's having always acted honorably and uprightly, 
 did certainly rest upon information it was unfortu- 
 nately impossible for her to communicate." 
 
 She added u that if she possessed the power of 
 doing so, she was convinced her Father would view 
 his character in the same favorable light that she 
 
 did." 
 
 " I am perfectly satisfied," answered Sir George. 
 w And to prove to you the reliance I place in your 
 discretion and judgment, I will follow the counsel 
 you have given me, and decide at once to take ad- 
 vantage of Colonel Algernon's kind offer. — But, my 
 dear Adelaide, as you knew the injustice of my re- 
 rentment against this Young Man, why did you not 
 sooner undeceive me ?" 
 
 Miss Fauconberg was much embarrassed, — at 
 length she said, 
 
 " I did once attempt to do so, but as I was unable 
 to speak clearly, I had little chance of succeeding."

 humiliation at the consciousness of what must now be

 Father, who have always been so kind, and so in- 
 dulgent to me, have too much reason to be hurt and 
 offended at any want of confidence on my part." 
 
 " We have said enough upon this subject," replied 
 Sir George, who was sorry to have distressed his 
 Daughter. " And if we cannot recal what is past, we 
 will at least determine to think no more about it. — So

 here and settle the preliminaries of our Treaty in 
 person. Such an overture would meet your approba- 
 tion, would it not ?" 
 
 " I feel very sensibly all the kindness of this inten- 
 tion," answered Adelaide, u And I may also add that 
 it would give me pleasure to see Colonel Algernon 
 here, — yet I am almost certain that he will not accept 
 your invitation." 
 
 Sir George looked both surprised and mortified. 
 
 a If he has made a decided resolution to avoid our 
 Society,'' said he, " far be it from me to endeavour to 
 persuade him to break it. 1 am glad you have pre- 
 vented my sending him a request which would only 
 have given him the trouble of devising a civil refusal."

 quite mistaken my meaning ; I never intended to 
 convey so ungracious an idea, and I am sure Colonel 
 Algernon would be the last person to undervalue your 
 kindness. I should very much regret if any rash 
 words of mine, deterred you from giving him the 
 invitation you proposed."

 Then taking up the Letter which was still before 
 her, and attentively studying" its conclusion, she said, 
 
 " I perceive that your Correspondent wishes to be 
 kindly remembered to Mama and to me, — and I sup- 
 pose that some compliment of the same sort will be 
 sent him in return. Would there be any impropriety 
 in your likewise telling him that I had requested you 
 to say ' that I hoped he would be able to obey your 
 summons to appear in the North ?' 
 
 Sir George considered for a minute or two before 
 he replied, 
 
 " I believe I may very well write what you pro- 
 pose. I will consult your Mother upon the subject, 
 and if she sees no objection to my giving such a mes- 
 sage, I will certainly do it." 
 
 At this mention of her Mother, Adelaide turned 
 very pale, a circumstance that did not escape her 
 Father's observation. It had more than once occurred 
 to him that some manoeuvre of Lady Fauconberg's 
 might have occasioned the mystery which had so long 
 perplexed him ; and from what had just passed in his 
 conversation with Adelaide, he began to think it was

 not quite impossible that Colonel Algernon had either 
 directly or indirectly proposed to his Daughter, and 
 that Lady Fauconberg had contrived to persuade her 
 to refuse him. At all events, he determined to try 
 the success of the Message Adelaide had suggested, 
 and having written his Letter, he took it into the 
 room where his Wife was sitting." 
 
 u I have been talking to Adelaide," said he, u who 
 seems to know more about this extraordinary Colonel 
 Algernon than any body else, and she still expresses 
 so firm a belief in his being a very meritorious charac- 
 ter, that she has almost converted me to her opinion. 
 Under this persuasion, I have told him that I will 
 thankfully purchase his Aunt's Estate, and I have 
 asked him to come to Fauconberg to settle the terms, 
 &c. &c. &c." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's confusion and uneasiness were 
 painfully evident, though she endeavoured to conceal 
 them by bending over her work. — She had in the 
 first instance attempted to persuade her Husband to 
 decline having any thing to do with the Lands, and 
 also to conceal from his Daughter the offer that had 
 been made to him.

 She now perceived that any arguments she could 
 bring forward against his decision, must prove una- 
 vailing ; perhaps she was afraid of beginning a dan- 
 gerous discussion, — She did not, therefore, venture to 
 make a single objection to a measure adopted in di- 
 rect contradiction to her advice and to her wishes, but 
 merely observed, as she returned him the Letter,— 
 u that the proposed purchase would certainly be a 
 desirable addition to his property, — and that Colonel 
 Algernon must be very ungallant indeed if he de- 
 clined obeying a Summons so flatteringly seconded 
 by a Young Lady." 
 
 " I trust he will accept my invitation," said Sir 
 George, coolly. — Adelaide at that moment entered 
 the room, and her Father turning towards her, re- 
 marked, u that as he had consulted her about what he 
 should say to Colonel Algernon, it would be very proper 
 she should seethe despatch he had prepared for him.'" 
 
 Lady Fauconberg with wonderful assurance, added, 
 " that she had no doubt Adelaide would highly ap- 
 prove of it." 
 
 Neither she or her Daughter dared to look at each

 other, and the accidental arrival of a morning Visi- 
 tor, was indeed a g^eat relief to the whole Party. 
 
 The subject of the communication that had been 
 opened with Colonel Algernon, was not often alluded 
 to by any of the Fauconberg Family for several days 
 after this discussion ; but his answer to Sir George's 
 invitation was expected by each of them with the 
 greatest anxiety. 
 
 The Post generally arrived during the breakfast 
 hour, and in due course of time a Letter franked 
 by Lord Altamont made its appearance. Adelaide 
 caught a glympse of the direction as her Father took 
 it out of the Bag. He did not keep her long in sus- 
 pense, but tearing it hastily open, and glancing his 
 eye over its contents, — which seemed comprised in 
 a very few lines ; he told his Companions " that Co- 
 lonel Algernon informed him his Principal was very 
 impatient for the immediate conclusion of the pro- 
 posed Treaty ; and as her Agent, (the Colonel,) 
 perfectly agreed with him in disliking epistolary Ne- 
 gociations, he should have much pleasure in making 
 a journey to the North to arrange the Preliminaries

 in person." — " He concludes by observing," con- 
 tinued the Baronet, u that he has always been taught 
 to respect the good old Proverb which says ' that 
 despatch is the life of business,' — he therefore hopes 
 to reach Fauconberg Manor very soon after the arri- 
 val of his Letter." 
 
 Adelaide had never quite expected he would come, 
 and in spite of her endeavours to maintain an ap- 
 pearance of composure, the pleasure her Father's 
 intelligence had given her, beamed brightly in her 
 countenance. — Lady Fauconberg's first impulse, on 
 hearing of his approach, was a feeling of extreme 
 vexation, — but as an instant's reflection convinced her 
 that the prospect of his L'nion with her Daughter had 
 now become inevitable, she thought the wisest thing she 
 could do, would be to resign herself quietly to her 
 fate, and make up her mind to receive her future 
 Son-in-Law with the best grace possible. — To Sir 
 George, the expectation of seeing Colonel Algernon 
 again under his own roof, was a subject of sincere 
 satisfaction. He was perfectly convinced that he had 
 condemned him erroneously, and he was impatient to

 have it in his power to make him reparation for the 
 injustice he had done him. 
 
 Henry was as good as his word. The very evening 
 of the day on which his Letter was received by the 
 Baronet, a carriage was heard to drive up to the door, 
 and an instant afterwards Colonel Algernon was an- 
 nounced. — Sir George greeted him with the kindest 
 and most cordial welcome, and even Lady Faucon- 
 berg condescended to smile upon him, — but so great 
 was his anxiety to ascertain what sort of reception he 
 was to meet with from their Daughter, that he scarce- 
 ly noticed any thing else. Adelaide changed colour 
 when he entered, and looked much embarrassed, but 
 there was an expression of pleasure in her counte- 
 nance ; and her manner was perfectly free from that 
 air of coldness and restraint which had so painfully 
 marked it when he had seen her in London. — He 
 hoped that he had reason to be satisfied, but both he 
 and Miss Fauconberg felt a kind of awkwardness that 
 was very uncomfortable. Henry was far from wish- 
 ing this to be apparent to his Host and Hostess. — 
 A Person who has just concluded a long journey, can

 always find subjects to dilate upon, in the roads, the 
 weather, and the country he has passed through ; — And 
 making the most of these upon the present occasion, 
 our Hero did not allow the conversation to languish. 
 
 As Sir George had discovered that Colonel Alger- 
 non had travelled night and day, he kindly hinted 
 that breakfast need not be ordered quite so early as 
 usual the following morning; Yet when Adelaide 
 came down stairs, she found the Colonel already 
 standing in the Hall, and apparently waiting as if he 
 wished to obtain an opportunity of speaking to her. 
 
 " Miss Fauconberg," said he, when their first 
 greeting was over, " I am extremely desirous to 
 have a few moment's conversation with you. I trust 
 you will believe I am perfectly sincere when I tell 
 you that I should never have ventured to intrude 
 myself here, unless I had expressly understood from 
 Sir George, that my presence would no longer prove 
 unwelcome to You" And as Adelaide was silent, 
 he continued, — 
 
 " If I have been so unhappy as to misinterpret the 
 meaning of your Father's Letter, I must request you

 now to undeceive me, — for even certainty of the most 
 dreadful disappointment would be preferable to the 
 suspense I at this moment endure. — All the necessary 
 arrangements relating to my business with Sir George, 
 can I imagine be completed in one day, and by to- 
 morrow morning I may be ready to depart and carry 
 an account of my Stewardship to Mrs. Algernon." 
 
 a And do you really think me so heartless," said 
 Adelaide, much affected, — " As to suppose I would 
 send you such a Message as my Father gave you, 
 merely out of empty compliment, or what would have 
 been far worse — for the purpose of sporting with your 
 feelings ?" 
 
 " Oh no, no !" exclaimed Henry, " to imagine 
 You capable of any unworthy motive was impossi- 
 ble : but I will confess that I have been presumptuous 
 enough to dare to flatter myself that it is not quite 
 improbable the promise you once informed me of, 
 may before this time have been cancelled." 
 
 " It is certainly true," replied Miss Fauconberg, 
 blushing very deeply, " that a considerable alteration 
 has taken place in many circumstances since I saw

 you last. But spare me, I beseech you, any further 
 allusions to that painful and distressing interview. I have 
 too much reason to wish that we could both forget it." 
 
 u There can be no wish of yours that I will obey 
 more readily," answered Colonel Algernon. " May 
 I venture to believe that you have thus given me your 
 permission to open my mind to your Father? — to 
 speak to him in short of the real object of my Jour- 
 ney, for of course you never supposed I came here 
 for the purpose of arranging a transfer of property 
 which would have been much more easily and ably 
 settled by Mrs. Algernon's Steward." 
 
 " I will not pretend to misunderstand you," replied 
 Adelaide in a low, tremulous voice, — " And having 
 said thus much, — the course you suggest is exactly 
 the one I should have myself desired you to pursue. 
 Indeed after all that has passed, I should not feel I 
 was justified in listening to another word until I had 
 received my Father's sanction to do so." 
 
 The sound of Sir George's voice upon the stair, put 
 a sudden conclusion to a tete a tete which had been 
 carried on long enough to relieve the parties con- 
 cerned from the mutual uneasiness they had enter- 
 
 u

 tained respecting each other's present feelings and 
 intentions. — Lady Fauconberg did not make her ap- 
 pearance for some time after the Baronet, and it must 
 be owned that her Guest looked forward to her arri- 
 val with very little impatience. Colonel Algernon 
 was in that enviable frame of mind which seemed to 
 communicate its happy influence to every thing he 
 said and did, and enabled him to render himself pecu- 
 liarly agreable. 
 
 Adelaide soon got the better of her agitation, and 
 being encouraged by her Father, and no longer fear- 
 ing any opposition from her Mother, she began by 
 degrees to regain her natural gaiety and unaffected 
 ease of manner. In short, the conversation was alto- 
 gether so amusing, and was supported with so much 
 animation, that the breakfast was extended to a very 
 unusual period. At length Sir George looked at his 
 Watch, and rising at the same moment from his 
 chair, — observed to Colonel Algernon ' that as they 
 had agreed to devote the morning to business, he was 
 afraid he must be ungallant enough to propose that 
 they should take leave of the Ladies for the present.' 
 The Colonel instantly obeyed his summons.

 ADELAIDE. 307 
 
 When they retired, Lady Fauconberg told her 
 Daughter ' she had so many Letters to write that she 
 must abandon her to her own reflections,' adding-, 
 with a smile, t that she trusted they would prove agre- 
 able ones.' And in this kind expectation, it may not 
 perhaps be presuming too much to believe that her 
 Ladyship was not very likely to be disappointed. 
 
 The conference between the two Gentlemen lasted 
 several hours, and they had been informed that Lun- 
 cheon had been announced, long before they were 
 ready to partake of it. When they did at length re- 
 enter the Dining Room, Lady Fauconberg imme- 
 diately read in the peculiar expression of Sir George's 
 countenance, and the happy importance of his man- 
 ner, that the dreaded explanation had actually taken 
 place; and the first glance of Colonel Algernon's 
 bright eye, as plainly told Adelaide that the confir- 
 mation of his future happiness, was now dependent 
 upon herself alone. 
 
 The beginning of Sir George's interview with his 
 Guest, had indeed related entirely to the Commission 
 with which the latter had been charged by Mi's. Al- 
 gernon, and it was not until every thing relating to

 308 ADELAIDE. 
 
 this, had been satisfactorily concluded, that he ven- 
 tured to introduce the subject which was so much 
 more vitally interesting to himself. In reference to 
 the Estate, he said, ' that he was almost ashamed to 
 mention the price that was demanded by his Relation, 
 but as he understood that the same sum had been 
 offered to her for it by Sir William Shirley, it had not 
 been possible for him to suggest to her that he thought 
 k an unreasonable one.' 
 
 " To be sure it was not," replied Sir George, " as 
 it is a very desirable object to me, I must expect to 
 purchase it rather dearly, and I feel very much obliged 
 to You for your kindness in having enabled me to do 
 so upon any terms." 
 
 Henry did not tell the Baronet how much difficulty 
 he had had in obtaining for him such a permission. 
 
 Colonel Algernon's affectionate attention to Lord 
 Altamont during his dangerous illness, had of course 
 much endeared him to his Grandfather, and ever 
 since that period Mrs. Algernon's fond partiality for 
 her Son had led her to feel a jealousy of her Nephew's 
 visibly encreasing influence with the old Peer. She 
 could not bear to think that he should love him better

 ADELAIDE. 309 
 
 than his former Favorite, Horace. She was painfully- 
 aware that any comparison he might draw between 
 the conduct of the two young men towards himself, 
 must be greatly to Henry's advantage. — And she 
 could not help fearing that Lord Altamont might 
 now be inclined to leave him a considerable portion of 
 that disposable property which she had hitherto con- 
 sidered as her Son's undoubted and rightful inheri- 
 tance. She did not attempt to conceal her jealousy 
 from her Nephew himself, who affected not to per- 
 ceive it, while he was really grieved at the unkind- 
 ness that prompted her to take every opportunity of 
 endeavouring to vex and thwart him about trifles. 
 
 When he heard of her intention to sell her Estate, 
 and asked her as a personal favour, to permit him to 
 offer it to a particular Friend of his own who was 
 very desirous to possess it, — She positively refused to 
 oblige him, though she had not then received Sir 
 William Shirley's Overture. Henry had at the mo- 
 ment no hope that any communication from him could 
 effect an alteration in his situation with respect to 
 Adelaide ; but he was anxious to prove his esteem 
 and gratitude towards Sir George, — and undaunted by

 this first repulse, he followed up his petition to Mrs. 
 Algernon so ably and so earnestly, that at length he 
 succeeded in gaining his point. He suspected that 
 she had taxed her compliance by making a most ex- 
 orbitant demand upon his Friend's purse, — but 
 against this imposition there was no appeal. — Per- 
 haps Mrs. Algernon would have closed at once with 
 Sir William Shirley's offer, whatever it was; had 
 she not been afraid of disobliging Lord Altamont who 
 had powerfully seconded Henry's wishes. Her Fa- 
 ther-in-Law always treated her with the greatest 
 kindness and consideration, but he had not failed to 
 remark her growing dislike to Henry ; he made some 
 allowance for her, as he was well aware of the cause 
 that occasioned it, but he was determined to support 
 his Grandson against her injustice. 
 
 To return from this digression. — The Party at 
 Luncheon at Fauconberg were more silent and em- 
 barrassed than they had been at breakfast; Sir 
 George indeed seemed very well inclined to talk, 
 but he was but feebly supported by his Companions. 
 At length he told Adelaide ' that it had been his 
 intention in the morning to invite her to accompany

 Colonel Algernon and himself in a ride, but as he now 
 found he had many things to talk over with her Mo- 
 ther, he had given up that plan; the Colonel,' he 
 said, i had been kind enough to excuse him, and as 
 he appeared to have no wish to go out on horseback 
 alone, he must depute Her to endeavour to amuse 
 him until they all met again.' He suggested that he 
 might perhaps be prevailed upon to take a walk; 
 and he recommended her to show him her Garden, or 
 whatever else she might think best worth seeing. 
 
 Henry seemed perfectly well satisfied with this 
 arrangement, and Miss Fauconberg, like a dutiful 
 Daughter, went up stairs to put on her shawl and 
 bonnet. 
 
 It is needless to relate minutely the conversation 
 that took place between Colonel Algernon and Ade- 
 laide during their walk. Such scenes, though deeply 
 interesting to the Parties themselves, are generally 
 much less so to every body else ; and as they always 
 lose considerably by being repeated, it is far better to 
 leave them, (after a short sketch,) to be filled up by 
 the imagination. Suffice it therefore to say, that a 
 most satisfactory explanation was entered into be-

 tween our Hero and Heroine, — They talked over all 
 their feelings, their hopes and fears from the first 
 hour they were introduced to each other, — They re- 
 joiced to find that their attachment was now sanc- 
 tioned by every one who had any right to control 
 their choice, — And they exchanged vows of mutual 
 constancy which they hoped soon to ratify at the Altar. 
 When they returned to the House, they found Sir 
 George and Lady Fauconberg walking up and down 
 before the windows to await them, and the affecting 
 Benediction bestowed upon her by her Father, and 
 the cordial kindness of the reception given to her by 
 her Mother, put the finishing touch to Adelaide's 
 happiness.

 Sir Walter Scot' 
 
 It may easily be imagined that Sir George Fau- 
 conbergand Colonel Algernon found abundant subjects 
 of consultation and arrangement, and that their atten- 
 tion was so much engrossed by more interesting and 
 important considerations, that the ostensible object of 
 Henry's journey stood some chance of being forgot- 
 ten. Every thing relating to the transfer had however 
 been nearly settled in the morning, and the same post 
 that conveyed the joyful intelligence of Colonel Al- 
 gernon's happiness, to his Grandfather, carried also 
 to Mrs. Algernon an account of the agreement he 
 had concluded in her name. 
 
 Lord Altamont was sincerely rejoiced at the pros-

 pect of Henry's approaching marriage; he lost no 
 time in congratulating him in the kindest and most 
 affectionate manner, and informed him that he should 
 immediately put him in possession of the very liberal 
 Portion which he had already settled upon him as 
 his fortune, at his own death. He likewise wrote a 
 very handsome letter to Sir George, expressing the 
 pleasure he felt at the proposed alliance between their 
 Families, and his impatience to become acquainted 
 with his future Grand-daughter, whose amiable cha- 
 racter was already well known to him. 
 
 Sir George was extremely gratified with this let- 
 ter : and any unfavourable impression he might have 
 formerly entertained of Lord Altamont's character, 
 in consequence of the reports he had heard of his 
 harshness to his unfortunate Son, — ^was now entirely 
 removed by the kindness and hberality of his conduct 
 towards Henry. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's pride was flattered by finding 
 how graciously Adelaide would be received by her 
 new Relations ; and she was not a little elated at 
 the high compliment thus paid to her Daughter by

 a person of Lord Altamont's rank and consequence, 
 and who had likewise the reputation of being pecu- 
 liarly haughty- 
 
 In a worldly point of view, the connexion Adelaide 
 was about to fonn, was as brilliant and advanta- 
 geous as even a Mother's vanity could desire for her. 
 Colonel Algernon's birth, his talents, and popularity 
 had established him so firmly in the good graces of 
 his fashionable Friends, that he would at once place 
 her in a more distinguished situation in Society, than 
 she could at first have attained as Mrs. Shirley,— 
 Since William with all his abilities was as yet little 
 known in England, Then her Ladyship considered 
 that his Cousin alone stood between Henry Algernon 
 and a Peerage. Horace was unmarried, and from all 
 she had heard of him, likely to continue so ; he led a 
 wild, desperate sort of life, and her active imagination 
 working upon these materials, saw the reversion of a 
 Coronet already suspended over her Daughter's head. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was one of those busy-minded 
 people whose restless brains must always be at work 
 upon some favorite project. Who having formed

 their schemes upon a very sHght foundation, — ^perhaps 
 upon a sudden caprice ; j)ursue them afterwards with 
 the most persevering obstihacy in contempt of all 
 reason and opposition. Yet should they happen to 
 find themselves hopelessly foiled in their endeavours 
 and ex23ectations ; do not allow themselves to he im- 
 moderately depressed by this failure, but soon forget 
 their disappointment by turning their attention to the 
 prosecution of some new plan. 
 
 She had laboured most strenuously to promote an 
 Union between Adelaide and Mr. Shirley, and to 
 prevent the Marriage that was now going to take 
 place; and to forward the one and avert the other, 
 she had not scrupled to have recourse to the most 
 j^erfidious and cruel expedients. But all her endea- 
 vours had proved totally unavailing. She consoled 
 herself by expatiating to her Friends upon the num- 
 berless advantages of the delightful Alliance her 
 Daughter had consented to accept. And she really 
 found great satisfaction in thinking of the Trousseau, 
 and arranging and re-arranging in her imagination 
 all the other preparations for the Wedding.

 Many circumstances had occurred to effect a change 
 in Lady Fauconberg's sentiments and feelings towards 
 Mr. Shirley, and ever since he had disgusted her by 
 his ungracious behaviour after his last disappointment, 
 she had persevered in her opposition to Colonel Al- 
 gernon merely from a dread that any renewal of in- 
 tercourse between him and Sir George, would bring 
 on an exposure of her own shameful duplicity. 
 
 Her Husband's manner when he communicated to 
 her the result of his interview with their Guest, had 
 been so kind as well as firm, that it had entirely re- 
 moved all apprehensions of this nature. She per- 
 ceived that the Colonel had contrived to justify his 
 own conduct to Sir George, without throwing the 
 least blame upon any one else. She could not help 
 admiring his generosity, since she knew he must have 
 been well aware of her open and constant hostility to 
 his views, and she more than suspected that he could 
 not have been quite ignorant of her secret and disho- 
 nourable practices against him. She had hitherto 
 regarded him with a prejudiced eye, but she now be- 
 gan to discover that he had many amiable and agre-

 able qualities, and she was no longer insensible to the 
 fascinating charm of his conversation. His behaviour 
 towards herself was uniformly considerate and atten- 
 tive. And she could not fail contrasting his conduct 
 with that of her former ungrateful Favorite Mr. 
 Shirley. She had had penetration enough to find 
 out that William had paid assiduous Court to her 
 because he hoped to receive assistance from her in 
 return, rather than from any cordial regard he enter- 
 tained for her. 
 
 She had deceived her Husband, afflicted her Daugh- 
 ter, and sacrificed her self-esteem in his Cause ; — and 
 yet when he had destroyed the fruit of all her labours 
 by his own rashness, he had turned his back upon her 
 as if He had been the injured person, and had treat- 
 ed her ever since that time with cold civihty and in- 
 difference. 
 
 She now only thought of him with anger and dis- 
 gust, and so deep was her resentment at the ingra- 
 titude he had shown her, that she felt a secret and 
 malicious satisfaction in reflecting upon the mortifica- 
 tion he would experience when he heard of Adelaide's 
 approaching Union with his Rival.

 Lady Fauconberg had been relieved from any 
 lingering feeling of false pride which might have 
 made her ashamed at once to yield a cheerful acqui- 
 escence to an alliance she had so long and obstinately 
 opposed, by the decided way in which Sir George 
 announced to her the fact of his having given his 
 consent to Colonel Algernon's proposal. — The only 
 difficulty that now remained, was how to devise the 
 most delicate mode of informing the Shirley Family 
 of the event that was about to take place. 
 
 Her Ladyship shrunk from the idea of encounter- 
 ing Julia's satirical congratulations; and both She and 
 Sir George felt an awkwardness in communicating to 
 their good Friend Sir William, a circumstance which 
 they knew he could not hear of without pain, however 
 calculated it might be to afford satisfaction to them- 
 selves. — To delay breaking the News to him much 
 longer, or to allow him to learn it from others, would 
 be equally unkind ; so they detenniiied to drive over 
 together and call at Greyfield. 
 
 The Baronet wrote a Letter, which he intended to 
 leave for Sir William in case he should not find him

 O ADELAIDE. 
 
 at home, and Lady Fauconberg also conveyed a Note 
 from Adelaide to her Friend Emily. 
 
 The Couple were not very sorry to be told when 
 they arrived at Greyfield that all the Party were gone 
 out, but they were considerably startled when the 
 Servant infonned them that Mr. Shirley w^as expected 
 to return from Scotland that Evening, and that his 
 Horses had actually been already despatched to Old- 
 thorpe to meet him. 
 
 " Poor William !" said Sir George, as they drove 
 away from the door, " we have brought but unwel- 
 come intelhgence to greet him ujion his arrival." 
 
 And Lady Fauconberg in spite of her resentment 
 against him, felt a strange sort of sensation, as she re- 
 plied — " He will indeed very soon receive a shock 
 that will stun him severely." 
 
 Sir Wilham Shirley's Agent had of course received 
 a definitive answer from Mi's. Algernon, declining 
 any further communication about the Estate, since 
 the person to whom she had previously offered it, had 
 agreed to purchase it. Sir William consequently 
 knew that his Neighbour had carried off the long-

 contested prize. Rumours at the same time reach- 
 ed Grey field of Colonel Algernon's appearance at 
 Fauconberg, and of his approaching Marriage with 
 Adelaide ; and these at once explained why Sir 
 George had been peculiarly favoured, in preference 
 to himself, by a person who was a Stranger to them 
 both. He naturally felt angry and mortified, but 
 the delicacy and cordial kindness of Sir George's 
 Letter, soothed and gratified him, and he found it 
 impossible to retain any animosity towards so old a 
 Friend. 
 
 Julia listened eagerly to the confirmation of a re- 
 port that had ardently excited her curiosity, but she 
 longed to hear a more minute account of every thing 
 connected with it, and she loudly regretted that she 
 had not been at home to cross-question Lady Faucon- 
 berg upon a subject that must be so very agreable to 
 her. — Emily rejoiced sincerely at Adelaide's happi- 
 ness. She retired to her room to read over her note 
 again, — to answer it, — and perhaps to subdue certain 
 painful feelings of her own which it had involuntarily 
 and powerfully awakened.

 10 ADELAIDE. 
 
 During Sir George and Lady Fauconberg's ab- 
 sence, Adelaide and Colonel Algernon had taken a 
 long ramble to visit a spot from whence the former 
 had made a little Drawing that had particularly 
 pleased Henry's fancy. The chosen position, was a 
 high, wild bank that overhung a narrow road ; it was 
 shaded on the opj)osite side by some stunted trees, 
 and the view that it commanded, though not exten- 
 sive, was peculiarly picturesque. — Colonel Algernon 
 was enchanted with it, he could not resist sketching 
 it himself, his task proceeded rapidly, and his Com- 
 panion was so deeply engaged in watching its pro- 
 gress, that neither of them noticed the footsteps of a 
 Horseman who was approaching at a rapid pace 
 along the road below them. 
 
 At length Henry made a bold flourish with his 
 pencil, and concluded a long string of playful criti- 
 cisms upon his own performance, by observing that 
 ' it would now do very well, — ^he had at least done 
 his best to render it as perfect as possible, — and at 
 any rate the present Sketch would furnish him with 
 materials to work upon hereafter.' — Then looking at

 the setting Sun, — " Adelaide," continued he, " these 
 long shadows warn us that it is time to think of re- 
 turning home. We shall be very late." 
 
 He closed his Drawing Book as he spoke ; Miss 
 Fauconberg took the arm he offered her, and they 
 turned to descend the Bank, and retrace their steps to 
 Fauconberg Manor. 
 
 The advancing Horseman was now so close to them 
 that he distinctly heard the conclusion of Henry's 
 remarks; these, together with the first glance he 
 caught of those features which had hitherto been 
 averted, at once revealed to him the whole of the 
 dreadful truth. A sudden giddiness came over him, 
 he turned deadly pale, and for an instant he reeled in 
 his saddle as if he would have fallen ! But speedily 
 recovering himself, he reined in his Steed, and has- 
 tily accosted Miss Fauconberg and her Companion, 
 who were much surprised at perceiving the Appari- 
 tion that seemed so suddenly to have risen up — below 
 them. 
 
 Adelaide started violently when she recognised 
 Mr. Shirley, — for He it wiis who stood before thcni ;

 And an involuntary impulse impelled her to cling 
 more closely to Henry Algernon's ami, as if she 
 apprehended that he still might have the power of 
 separating her from him. — And then, as if ashamed 
 of her own weakness, she cordially held out her hand 
 to her rejected Admirer ; asked how long he had 
 heen come back, and enquired after her Friends at 
 Greyfield ? 
 
 Wilham told her he could give her no account of 
 his Father and his Sisters, as he was only then upon 
 his way home ; And pleading impatience to see his 
 Family after so protracted an absence, he dashed the 
 spurs into his Horse, and was soon out of sight. 
 
 " Poor Mr. Shirley !" exclaimed Colonel Algernon 
 as he watched his rapid disappearance. " I pity him 
 with all my heart I" 
 
 Adelaide looked distressed. — '' I am sure," said 
 she thoughtfully, " I should be guilty of deep ingra- 
 titude if I did not feel a sincere regard for William 
 Shirley. But as he is well aware I can never feel 
 more than regard for him, it appears very extraordi- 
 nary that he should continue to vex himself thus upon

 my account. I cannot understand why he should 
 cherish a preference for a person who is unable to 
 return it. And it grieves me to perceive that my 
 insensibility can still cast a shade over the happiness 
 of another." 
 
 Colonel Algernon perfectly agi'eed with her in 
 lamenting the weakness that prevented Mr. Shirley 
 from endeavouring to overcome a hopeless passion ; 
 but he looked very much as if he did not consider it 
 quite so astonishing as she did, that he should not be 
 able to succeed in such a difficult undertaking. 
 
 The subject was not a particularly agreahle one to 
 either of them, as it was calculated to recal many 
 painful recollections ; and during the remainder of 
 their walk, Henry Algernon and Adelaide contrived 
 to divert the conversation to other topics.

 The more Henry Algernon saw of Adelaide, the 
 more did he admire the amiable sweetness of her 
 disposition, the playful gaiety of her tem^Der, and the 
 unaffected superiority of her judgment and under- 
 standing. Few young Ladies of her age, possessed 
 so much information, he did not know many who 
 were as highly accomplished ; yet he had never be- 
 fore met with any one who was so perfectly natural, 
 modest, and unj)retending. He found her at all 
 times a most interesting and delightful Companion, 
 and he anticipated with much satisfaction the pride

 and pleasure he should feel in introducing her to Lord 
 Altamont and to all his Friends. He was much 
 struck with the kindness of her manner to her Depen- 
 dents and her poor Xeighbours ; he had requested 
 her to take him to visit some of the Cottagers in the 
 Village of Fauconberg ; and the affection with which 
 they all looked up to her, gave the clearest evidence 
 of those deeds of active goodness and charity which 
 she carefully endeavoured to conceal from all the 
 world. 
 
 In the space of about a fortnight from the period 
 of Colonel Algernon's arrival in the Xorth, every ar- 
 rangement respecting the Marriage Settlements had 
 been agreed upon between the parties themselves, 
 or more properly speaking had been made by Sir 
 George : and nothing now remained but to have 
 them legally drawn up. The Baronet bestowed a 
 very handsome Portion upon his Daughter, which was 
 to be paid down to her immediately: And he also 
 announced to her that the whole of his property had 
 already been settled upon her at his death, — excepting 
 a Provision which he had made for her Mother if she 
 survived him, — and a few inconsiderable Lesracies.

 As Henry was to continue in the Army, it was 
 decided that the Young- Couple should purchase a 
 House in London, and establish themselves directly 
 there: And since Sir George told them he hoped 
 they would contrive to spend as much of their time 
 as possible at Fauconberg, — And as Colonel Alger- 
 non said he trusted he should for many years continue 
 to devote a portion of his Leave to his Grandfather ; — 
 it did not appear necessary that they should at pre- 
 sent have any Abode of their own in the Country. 
 
 Lawyers have very justly acquired the reputation 
 of being extremely tedious people to be concerned 
 with, and those who are placed in Henry Algernon's 
 circumstances are apt to consider them pecuHarly so. 
 Documents that had been speedily sketched out upon 
 paper, took a much longer time when they were to 
 be transferred and fairly drawn up upon parchment : 
 And so many delays seemed likely to occur to retard 
 the completion of the Settlements, that as the Autumn 
 was now very far advanced, Sir George Fauconberg 
 proposed that his Daughter's marriage should not 
 take place until the following Spring.

 Colonel Algernon protested very earnestly against 
 its being deferred to so distant a jDeriodj and he urged; 
 many mighty reasons to prove to his future Father- 
 in-Law the manifest inexpediency of its being post- 
 poned one moment longer than was absolutely 
 necessary. To Adelaide he confessed that he was 
 haunted by a sort of superstitious feeling which made 
 him apprehend that if their Union was delayed for 
 several Months, some unforeseen Obstacle would start 
 up to put it off altogether. 
 
 Miss Fauconherg would not he persuaded to anti-. 
 cipate the probability of such a misfortune ; yet while 
 she endeavoured to combat and remove Henry's vi- 
 sionary fears, she found that they had made an uncom- 
 fortable impression upon her own mind. Colonel 
 Algernon acknowledged his weakness, but pleaded in 
 its excuse, ' that he felt the happiness of his future 
 life now depended so entirely upon the fulfilment of 
 their engagement, — he could not help dreading the 
 possibility that his Evil Genius might still interpose 
 and blight his dearest hopes before they were secured 
 to him.' He told Adelaide ' he believed the peculiar

 circumstances attending his early childliood and edu- 
 cation had had considerable influence upon his cha- 
 racter; And that the unusual train of misfortunes, 
 adverse accidents, and disappointments which had 
 pursued him almost from the hour of his birth : had 
 given rise to the anxiety which made him distrust the 
 continuance of his present felicity, — For distrust was 
 a feeling by no means natural or congenial to his 
 mind. 
 
 He briefly ran over the diffbrent Stages and Events 
 of his Life, and said that before he had the happiness 
 of knowing her^ he had felt himself a solitary and 
 deserted Being : for even his Grandfather did not 
 then seem to regard him with the affectionate kind- 
 ness he had shown towards him since, and though he 
 had numbers of soi-disant Friends, there was no per- 
 son whom he had the least claim to expect to take 
 any particular interest in his weal or woe. 
 
 He had been obliged to fight his own way in the 
 world, and had had many difficulties and mortifica- 
 tions to contend with ; yet it was not till after his 
 return to England that he had become fully sensible

 ADELAIDE. 19 
 
 of his forloni and isolated situation. The years he 
 spent at School had passed happily enough. — ^\Vhen 
 he entered the Army and joined his Regiment 
 Abroad, a new career was opened before him, and 
 the activity, excitement, and enterprize of a Soldier's 
 life, were extremely well calculated to suit his taste. 
 But the Peace had at once cut off all chance of his 
 being again employed upon Foreign Service, and 
 destro3^ed his hopes of acquiring honour and distinc- 
 tion in his profession. Nothing remained to occupy 
 his time and attention, but a monotonous routine of 
 Military Duty. — This brought him back to London, 
 where for want of some better resource, he plunged 
 eagerly into society, and entered with enthusiasm 
 into all that was going forward. In a shorl time lie 
 found he had somehow become a popular and a 
 courted character ; His vanity was gratified, and he 
 was very well inclined to be pleased with those who 
 had shown good taste enough to be pleased with him. 
 But at length he grew tired of being involved day 
 after day in the same continual round of heartless 
 gaiety and amusement. He discovered that his

 Companions were selfish and worldly, many of them 
 were frivolous and insipid; And he sighed for les>s 
 uninteresting pursuits, and more amiable and rational 
 Associates. He knew not, however, where to seek 
 either the one or the other ; the force of habit carried 
 him on in a train of engagements that now afforded 
 him little pleasure. In public he talked and laughed 
 gaily enough, and those who saw him in Society 
 might perceive no alteration in his Spirits, — They 
 little suspected how very wretched and desolate he 
 often felt in private. 
 
 ' It was when his mind was in this unhappy state/ 
 he added, ^ that he first met Her, and from that 
 moment a fresh impulse was given to all his ideas. 
 He had found in her, the amiable and lovely Per- 
 son his fancy had often delighted to picture ; — ^A 
 Being he had hitherto considered rather as the 
 Creature of his own imagination, than as any thing 
 he was ever likely to see realized in actual life. — ^He 
 felt assured that if he could be so fortunate as to suc- 
 ceed in winning her affections, he should secure to 
 himself the blessing of domestic comfort, which had

 ADELAIDE. 21 
 
 long been the object of his ambition. He had ac- 
 quired an inducement and an interest to rouse him to 
 exertion, and amidst all the vicissitudes of hope and 
 fear which had so powerfully agitated him during 
 the last eventful year and a half, — he had at least for- 
 gotten the melancholy and depressing sensation of 
 thinking himself disregarded by his few remaining 
 Relations, and unconnected with, if not indifferent to 
 every body else.* 
 
 It will readily be beUeved that Adelaide listened 
 with the deepest interest to the simple and touching 
 description Henry Algernon thus gave her of his own 
 feelings. She was far from insensible to the happi- 
 ness of supposing she had been instrumental in dis- 
 pelUng the gloom that was beginning to creep over 
 his mind; and her attachment towards him seemed 
 daily to gain additional strength from the observations 
 she was enabled to form of his character, as well as 
 from every circumstance relating to his conduct. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg often talked to Henry of Lord 
 Altamont, and he always appeared pleased and gra- 
 tified by the veneration not unmingled with pity, 
 which she expressed for his Grandfather. — She had

 22 ADELAIDE. 
 
 frequently attempted to lead him to speak of his Cou- 
 sin Colonel Algernon, but the subject never seemed 
 to be an agreable one to him ; and at last he frankly 
 told her ' that as Horace had been his earliest Com- 
 panion and Friend, he did not like to expose his faults 
 and dwell upon his misdeeds. When he mentioned 
 him to Others, it was easy to draw a veil over his 
 failings, but if he spoke of him to Her it could only be 
 exactly as he thought of him.' ' Horace,' he said, 
 ' was a person highly gifted by nature, but ruined 
 by education ; and a long perseverance in evil and 
 disreputable courses, had he feared rendered him as 
 heartless as he was unprincipled. He possessed the 
 power of making himself eminently agreable to any 
 one he wished to please.' " Yet I do not think Ade- 
 laide," continued he, " that You would quite like 
 him, there is a certain tone of insolence in his man- 
 ner that would not suit your taste, and you would I 
 am sure be shocked by the sneering levity of his con- 
 versation ; for I understand he has latterly acquired 
 the habit of turning into ridicule every thing that 
 ought to be considered respectable and sacred." 
 " What a dreadful picture you have drawn of your

 Cousin !" replied Miss Fauconberg, almost shudder- 
 ing". " I believe Colonel Algernon was one of Wil- 
 liam Shirley's Friends abroad. It does not give me 
 a favourable opinion of Him to learn that he should 
 have chosen such an Associate." 
 
 " We will not in this instance," answered Henry, 
 " very harshly enforce the infallible truth of the Pro- 
 verb that says " tell me your Company and I will 
 tell you your manners;" fori have certainly heard 
 that Horace and Mr. Shirley were much together in 
 Italy. — I have had very little communication with 
 my Cousin myself for some time, but I still feel that 
 we are very near Relations ; and if it should ever be in 
 my power to be of any use to him, I would joyfully 
 make any possible exertion, any personal sacrifice in 
 his behalf. He will probably live very little in Eng- 
 land in future, — at any rate we shall meet but seldom ; 
 he well knows my opinion of his conduct and proceed- 
 ings, — and that has passed between us which does not 
 make us feel very comfortable in each others society." 
 
 At length there appeared a probability of the 
 Lavvvers beina, able to conclude their business more

 speedily than had been originally anticipated; and 
 Sir George Fauconberg, yielding to Colonel Alger- 
 non's importunity, consented to promise that the 
 Wedding Day should be settled as soon as all the 
 necessary preparations had been completed. 
 
 As the choice of a future Residence would require 
 much consideration, it was judged expedient that 
 Henry should take a ready-furnished House in Lon- 
 don for some months, where he and Adelaide might 
 estabhsh themselves until they had had time to look 
 around them and select at their leisure a more per- 
 manent Habitation. To put this plan in execution, 
 it was necessary that Colonel Algernon should go up 
 to Town, — he had other business there which was 
 likely to detain him some weeks ; and he hoped that 
 by the expiration of that period, all Sir George's ar- 
 rangements would have advanced to such a state of 
 forwardness, that when he returned to the North no 
 impediment would remain to prevent his claiming 
 the immediate performance of the Baronet's promise. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg looked forward to Henry's de- 
 parture with much regret, yet as she saw nothing to

 ajjprehend iVom their separation, she determined not 
 to allow herself to be depressed by the idea of his 
 absence ; — it could only be considered as an evil be- 
 cause it would deprive her for a time of the pleasure 
 of his Society. 
 
 He was now to set out in a few days, but the Fa- 
 mily Party were not to be left alone^ as two Ladies 
 were previously expected to arrive at Fauconberg 
 Manor, who had long been in the habit of paying* an 
 annual visit there. 
 
 This year indeed they had ventured gently to hint 
 that they feared their company, might under the pre- 
 sent peculiar circumstances, prove troublesome to 
 their Host and Hostess ; but Lady Fauconberg had 
 easily removed their scruples by assuring them that 
 ' it would be a pleasure instead of an inconvenience 
 to Sir George and herself to receive them ;' and she 
 added ' that it would give them much satisfaction to 
 introduce them to their future Son-in-Law.' 
 
 Though the Season was so far advanced, the weather 
 still continued fine, and Henry Algernon and Ade- 
 laide pursued their walks with very httle interruption

 26 ADELAIDE. 
 
 from the elements. — They had staid out longer than 
 usual on the day on which the above mentioned Guests, 
 (namely Mrs. Sutton, a Widow Lady, who had seen 
 full fifty summers, — and Miss Drake, her unmarried 
 Sister of nearly the same age,) had announced their 
 intention of arriving at Fauconberg. 
 
 As they returned home through the Garden, Ade- 
 laide recollected that she wanted some Flowers to 
 make fresh Nosegays for her own little Sitting Room. 
 
 '' Miss Drake," said she, " will I have no doubt 
 propose to come and visit me there to-morrow morn- 
 ing ; she gave me the two China Vases that stand upon 
 the Chimney Piece, — she would think I had forgotten 
 to value her present if she found them empty, and she 
 would be scarcely less shocked at my untidiness if she 
 saw them filled with faded Flowers." 
 
 While Henry was assisting Miss Fauconberg to 
 gather a profusion of Holyhocks, Dalias, Michaelmas 
 Daisies, Carnations, and late blowing Roses, — his 
 Companion observed that ' she was persuaded the two 
 Ladies whom he was so soon to be presented to, were 
 extremely anxious to become acquainted with him.'

 " That idea is so flattering to me," replied the 
 Colonel, " that I feel I ought to be equally impatient 
 to see them^ and as they are Friends of Youi's, 1 may 
 add that I am very much inclined to be pleased with 
 them." 
 
 " They certainly are very old Friends of ours,"' 
 said Adelaide, " and have always sho^\^l great kind- 
 ness to me, — yet I must acknowledge I suspect that 
 you are more likely to be amused than enchanted 
 with them. Mrs. Sutton is a very good humoured 
 Person, but she is the greatest Gossip in the world, 
 and will entertain you wilh the private history of 
 every Family of her Acquaintance, — which is a pretty 
 largfe one. Not to mention Anecdotes of Servants 
 and various domestic arrangements, of which she has 
 an endless collection. It is really extraordinary how 
 she can contrive to obtain all the information of that 
 kind, which she possesses, and curious that she should 
 feel so much interest in doing so. Her principal ob- 
 ject in collecting News seems to be that she may en- 
 joy the pleasure of communicating it to her Friends, 
 and she is never half so proud and so happy as when 
 she is able to be the first to disclose what has hitherto

 been a secret, or to publish a piece of intelligence 
 previously unknown to her Auditors." 
 
 '' Your description is dehghtful," exclaimed Henry, 
 " I must endeavour to work my way into Mrs. Sut- 
 ton's good graces by listening attentively to all her 
 narraions, and affecting never before to have heard 
 one word of any thing she may happen to tell me. 
 I may perhaps manage too to furnish her with a little 
 store of Historiettes that may be retailed with ad van - 
 tage hereafter. — Does Miss Drake concern herself as 
 much about her Neighbours' affairs as her Sister? 
 She is an Old Maid I presume." 
 
 ^* She is/' replied Adelaide, " and though she is 
 very like Mrs. Sutton in some respects, their charac- 
 ters are widely different in others. Miss Drake is ex- 
 tremely quick and penetrating, and nothing ever 
 escapes her observation. She is excessively particular 
 about trifles, and is not generally reckoned very lenient 
 in her opinions of those who do not chance to be her 
 favorites. She will soon give you to understand that 
 she had formerly a number of Admirers, and that 
 it was entirely from choice she remained unmarried.'' 
 
 " Then I have only," obsei'ved Henry, " to treat

 her with the most punctilious civility and attention, 
 to throw out occasional hints about cruelty and hard- 
 ness of heart ; and with a fair spice of present com- 
 pliments to mingle sundry insinuations of the rumours 
 I have heai'd of her numerous conquests in by-gone 
 days." 
 
 " Oh," said Adelaide, laughing, " I can perfectly 
 fancy the terms of praise and admiration in which she 
 will describe you to all her Correspondents. — I have 
 one more little warning to give you; Miss Drake, 
 who is peculiarly studious in the choice of her own 
 Dress, never fails to notice very minutely that of 
 others. She will certainly scrutinize Yours from 
 head to foot, so pray make yourself very smart to 
 appear before her." 
 
 " I am much obliged to you for the hint," replied 
 Colonel Algernon, " And you may depend upon it I 
 will not forget to be particularly assiduous in the ar- 
 rangement of my toilette." 
 
 At this moment the sound of the Dressing Bell 
 was heard. Adelaide started. " I did not think," 
 exclaimed she, " that it had been near so late. We 
 must hasten back to the House as speedily as possible.

 Our worthy Guests would consider it an unpardonable 
 breach of civility and decorum on My part at least, 
 if we kept them waiting for their Dinner on the first 
 day of their arrival ; I am afraid they hardly thought 
 it quite proper that I did not stay at home to w^elcome 
 them upon their entrance." 
 
 Miss Fauconberg's Boudoir looked towards the 
 Garden ; one of the windows opened down to the 
 Ground, and to save time She and her Companion 
 went in that way instead of going round to the Hall 
 Door. Adelaide carefully put aside the small Bou- 
 quet Colonel Algernon had selected for herself, and 
 then taking the larger Nosegay he had carried home 
 for her, she hastily removed the Flowers that had 
 previously filled her Vases, and placing the fresh ones, 
 (just as they happened to be jumbled together, — ) 
 in their room ; she observed, " there was still water 
 enough left to keep them alive during the night, and 
 she would remember to come down before breakfast 
 the next morning, and arrange the poor things more 
 elegantly." — Having again cautioned Henry not to 
 be too late for Dinner, she ran up stairs to dress.

 Miss Fauconberg's toilette was completed before 
 the Second Bell rung ; at the foot of the stair she was 
 hailed by Colonel Algernon, who had bounded down 
 by at least two steps at a time, and who declared it 
 was the most fortunate circumstance for him in the 
 world that he had thus overtaken her, — since after all 
 she had told him of the Strangers, he should have 
 felt quite alarmed at the idea of encountering them 
 without her support. Both he and Adelaide were in 
 high spirits. When they entered the Drawing-Room

 they found the two Guests ah-eady stationed upon a | 
 Sofa, one on each side of Lady Fauconberg. 
 
 Mrs. Sutton was a comely Dame, perhaps rather 
 too much en bon point, with a smihng, good hu- 
 moured countenance, not pecuharly remarkable for 
 its intelligence. Miss Drake was taller and thinner, 
 and had considerable remains of beauty. The ex- 1 
 pression of her features was much more sensible, but 
 far less amiable and prepossessing than her Sister's. 
 Each of the Ladies greeted Adelaide with much 
 affection, and seemed indeed sincerely pleased to 
 
 see her. 
 
 When Colonel Algernon was introduced to them 
 by Lady Fauconberg, he could not help observing a 
 coldness and restraint in her manner which put him 
 disagreably in mind of her deportment towards him 
 in former times, and was widely different from the 
 gracious treatment he had experienced from her 
 lately. Adelaide also was forcibly struck with her 
 Mother's fingidity,— it both surprised and pained her, 
 and she felt perfectly at a loss to account for it. Her 
 dismay was considerably heightened when her Fa-

 tlicr at length made his appearance. Sir George look- 
 ed extremely pale ; his eyes instead of seeking his 
 Daughter as they usually did, seemed studiously 
 averted from her and Henry. He entered at once 
 into an animated conversation with Mrs. Sutton, — he 
 talked faster than he was accustomed to do, — ^his air 
 was much hurried, — and his spirits were evidently 
 forced. Adelaide watched him with the most anxious 
 solicitude, — she had never seen him thus before, — 
 and she felt sure that he was either ill, or that some- 
 thing very dreadful must have happened ! She looked 
 fearfully towards Colonel Algernon, and she read in 
 his countenance that he shared her apprehensions. 
 Dinner was announced, and during their progress to 
 the Dining Room, Mrs. Sutton and her Host con- 
 tinued the discussion that had previously occupied 
 them. As Colonel Algernon insisted upon escorting 
 Miss Drake, Lady Fauconberg advanced towards 
 Adelaide. — 
 
 " You must, I am afraid my Love," said she, '' be 
 contented with My arm ; it is not the first time it 
 has supported you, and I trust it will not be the last."

 These words were spoken in a tone of kindness 
 strangely mingled with comj^assion ; and unimportant 
 as they were in themselves, they contributed, (as the 
 slightest circumstances are apt to do at such a mo- 
 ment,) to strengthen the impression of impending evil 
 that had taken hold of her Daughter's mind. She 
 took Lady Fauconberg's arm without being able to 
 make her any reply. She did not dare either to con- 
 fess her fears or to enquire if they were groundless ; 
 but her anxiety about her Father gave her courage 
 to ask if he was ill ? 
 
 " Not in health," answered Lady Fauconberg in a 
 whisper ; " But he received some unpleasant news 
 this morning, which as you justly remark has affected 
 his appearance. He will tell you all about it to-mor- 
 row, — at least as much as it is proper and necessary 
 for You to know ; and in the mean while, my dear 
 Adelaide, there is no occasion for you to distress 
 yourself. The intelligence may prove incorrect, 
 exaggerated, or even altogether untrue. At any rate 
 it is important that our Visitors should not perceive 
 that any thing unusual has occurred."

 Adelaide was so rejoiced at being relieved from her 
 most painful apprehensions respecting her Father, 
 that she felt she could cheerfully bear any other 
 misfortune. Her Mother's explanation had left her 
 completely in the dark as to the nature of the cala- 
 mity he had not yet been able to find an opportunity 
 of communicating to her; — ^but her concluding hint 
 produced the desired effect, and Miss Faucouberg 
 determined to endeavour to assume an appearance of 
 cheerfulness and unconcern. Placed between Lady 
 Fauconberg and Mrs. Sutton, she was ably supported 
 by the one, while she had nothing to do but occasion- 
 ally to seem to listen with deep attention to the volu- 
 minous histories related for her edification, by the 
 other; And in this way she acted her part much 
 better than she imagined she could have done. 
 
 Though Miss Drake had allowed Colonel Algernon 
 
 to conduct her from the Drawing-Room, she would 
 
 by no means consent to his seating himself beside 
 
 her at table. " It was very right," she said, '' to 
 
 divide Man-ied People upon such occasions, but she 
 
 would never be guilty of the cruelty of separating a 
 
 Promis from his Promise."

 Henry insisted however upon maintaining his posi- 
 tion, and if tlie gaiete de coeur which had animated 
 him half an hour before, had now completely forsaken 
 him, he still contrived to make himself very agreable 
 to his Neighbour. She set him down in her own 
 
 o 
 
 mind as a remarkably well-bred, sensible, entertain- 
 ing Young Man ; and when he now and then looked 
 a little absent, or answered rather a tort, she thought 
 it was very excusable, — indeed very natural in a per- 
 son under his peculiar circumstances. 
 
 The instant the Ladies returned to the Drawing- 
 Room, Miss Fauconberg was overwhelmed with con- 
 gratulations and kind wishes for her future happiness, 
 mingled with compliments upon Colonel Algernon, 
 from both the Sisters. She thanked them very 
 gratefully, but congratulation and hajjpiness sounded 
 very little in unison with her present feelings. Lady 
 Fauconberg fidgetted about the room, as if the sub- 
 ject was any thing but agreable to Aer, and she took 
 advantage of the first pause that occurred, to observe 
 to her Daughter that they must have some Music in 
 the course of the evening.

 '' Oh yes, pray be so good as to sing us some of 
 your charming Songs, Adelaide," exclaimed Mrs. 
 Sutton. 
 
 Miss Drake enquired if Colonel Algernon was 
 musical ? and on being answered in the affinnative, 
 expressed a hope that they should hear his voice also. 
 
 '' He will have much pleasure I dare say," replied 
 Lady Fauconberg, " in accompanying Adelaide in 
 some of her favorite Duets by and bye : In the mean 
 time, my dear," continued she, addressing herself to 
 her Daughter, " You can let us hear one or two of 
 the last new things you received from the circulating 
 Library." 
 
 Adelaide had never felt less inclination either to 
 play or sing, yet at her Mother's desire she went 
 immediately to the Piano-Forte, and in looking for 
 her Music Books she was surprised to find a Manu- 
 script Song she had not recollected to have seen 
 before. It was folded in the form of a Letter ; the 
 words, which were Spanish, had evidently been writ- 
 ten by Colonel Algernon, but the notes seemed to 
 have been added by another and a more delicate hand.

 The paper was much discoloured, and one corner of 
 it was spotted with several broad, dark stains. — She 
 examined it attentively, and concluding it was some 
 old friend Henry had accidentally discovered in his 
 Writing Case, and had placed among her Music, 
 she determined to try it immediately that she might 
 be able to sing it to him without hesitation. The Air 
 was wild and melancholy, and Adelaide had learnt 
 enough of the Spanish Language to understand that 
 the words were the lamentation of an unhappy Lady 
 who imagined herself no longer beloved by the Object 
 of her affection. She had much difficulty in making 
 out the Tune, for the Notes were neither correctly or 
 intelligibly written, but she would not give up the 
 attempt until she had made herself completely mistress 
 of it. 
 
 ' This plaintive Ditty,' thought Miss Fauconberg 
 as she puzzled over it, ' must have been given to 
 Henry by some Spanish Damsel, — one of those fasci- 
 nating dark eyed Beauties whose deep devotion to 
 their Lovers, 1 have frequently heard him so elo- 
 quently describe.' — And it was a kind of jealous sus-

 picion, — though the feeling was unknown to herself; 
 that made her anticipate with much curiosity the 
 train of recollections that might be awakened in his 
 mind by a well known Air which he had not proba- 
 bly heard for several years. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was either so absent or so much 
 engrossed by her own endeavours to entertain her 
 Guests, that it never seemed to occur to her that 
 although it might be extremely improving to her 
 Daughter to practice the same passage and repeat the 
 same Song, over and over again, — it could not be 
 very entertaining to others to hear her do so. And 
 when Miss Drake asked her, in a tone which implied 
 any thing but admiration, * What that Air was taken 
 from ?' she merely said, ' she did not exactly know, 
 Adelaide had had a great deal of New Music lately ; 
 but as the Song in question, appeared to be Spanish, 
 she supposed it was one that Colonel Algernon had 
 brought her.' 
 
 The tete a tete between Sir George and the Colo- 
 nel was of short duration. The latter contrived to 
 draw Adelaide aside for a few moments under the

 pretence of showing her a Hkeness he affected to have 
 discovered for somebody well known to them both, in 
 a Book of Prints : — And as she stooped to examine it, 
 he said to her in a low and anxious voice, — " What 
 can be the matter with your Father? He is quite 
 unlike himself to-day." 
 
 " He has heard some bad news," replied Adelaide, 
 '' which has much distressed him. I do not know 
 what it is; but from the little Mama has told me, 
 and from the caution she gave me not to allow the 
 Strangers to perceive that any thing was wrong, — 
 I susjjcct it must be some misfortune of a pecuniary 
 nature that hangs over us." 
 
 " I hope you are right," answered Henry, fer- 
 vently, '' I trust it may prove to be nothing worse." 
 
 It was impossible to prolong this discussion without 
 attracting the observation of the rest of the Party : 
 and the little that had been said on either side, was 
 very far from having diminished the feeling of uneasi- 
 ness and apprehension that had weighed so heavily 
 upon both. 
 
 As soon as the Tea and Coffee were removed, Mrs.

 Sutton reminded Adelaide that it was time to begin 
 the Second Part of the Concert, and requested her to 
 sing" a popular Ballad of the day, which was, she 
 said, a particular favorite of her own. Colonel Al- 
 gernon did not probably much admire her choice, — 
 he was deeply engag'ed in conversation with Miss 
 Drake, and he seemed to take very little notice of 
 the IVIusic. Miss Fauconherg sung several English 
 Ail's, and then deteiiiiined to attempt her Spanish 
 Song". She placed the Manuscript before her, and 
 had scarcely played three or four bars of the tune, 
 when she observed that Henry's attention was sud- 
 denly and forcibly arrested. For a moment her voice 
 was inclined to tremble, but it regained its power and 
 steadiness, and she executed the first line with so 
 much simplicity and feeling that Colonel Algernon 
 actually started from his chair. 
 
 He listened another instant, and then abniptly 
 leaving Miss Drake in the middle of an unfinished 
 sentence, he rushed up to the Piano-Forte, and ea- 
 gerly glancing his eye over the Manuscript, ex- 
 claimed in a tone of agony, " Where could you

 possibly get that Song, Adelaide ? — For mercy sake 
 do not sing any more of it ! Never sing it again I" 
 
 Miss Fauconberg stopped. She looked at him with 
 astonishment and dismay, for she was literally terri- 
 fied at the wildness of his appearance and manner. 
 
 Without seeming to observe her alarm, he hent 
 down to examine the Music more closely, and then as 
 if scarcely sensible even of her presence, he muttered 
 the following broken incoherent sort of Soliloquy. 
 
 " This is the very Copy I wrote out for her ! — 
 These words were the last she ever sang ! — ^It is most 
 wonderful ! — I always believed that a sure and awful 
 retribution must follow such a desperate deed. — The 
 existence of this Paper in this place, — the sound of 
 this fatal Air sung by Adelaide's voice, — prove too 
 truly that such a secret, however long and carefully 
 concealed, will at last be certainly brought to light." 
 
 Miss Fauconberg listened with speechless horror to 
 language as fearfully incomprehensible as his beha- 
 viour was extraordinary. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg, who knew that her Visitors liked 
 Cards, had just proposed to them to play a Rubber at

 Whist with Sir George and herself, when her curiosity 
 was attracted by the cessation of the Music. She went 
 to ascertain the cause of the interruption, and affect- 
 ing great surprise at perceiving the haggard expres- 
 sion of Colonel Algernon's countenance, and the grief 
 and consternation that were pourtrayed in her Daugh- 
 ter's ; she anxiously enquired what could possibly have 
 happened ? 
 
 If Adelaide understood her Mother's question, she 
 was quite incapable of answering it. But the sound 
 of Lady Fauconberg's voice seemed to recal Henry's 
 recollection. He pleaded having been attacked by a 
 violent paroxysm of pain in his head. Said that he 
 had felt it coming on some time, — that the Music 
 had probably brought it to a crisis, — and that for 
 several moments it had driven him almost distracted. 
 '' I fear/' continued he, turning to Adelaide, " that 
 I frightened you very much, and I perfectly detest 
 myself for having done so. — ^I feel so much better now 
 that I have no doubt the acces is very nearly over. I 
 will go out and take a turn or two upon the flags, — 
 for I always fuid the fresh air does me more good than 
 any thing, when I am affected in this way."

 " I hope it may relieve you now," replied she, 
 attempting to smile ; but as he left the room the tears, 
 in spite of her efforts to restrain them, rolled rapidly 
 down her cheeks. 
 
 Sir George who had followed Lady Fauconberg to 
 the Piano-Forte had of course heard every word that 
 had passed, — her Ladyship looked at him very signi- 
 ficantly, but merely remarked that they had better 
 go and sit down to their Whist. 
 
 " Adelaide, my love," said she, " You do not look 
 quite w^ell yourself, if you feel tired it is not necessary 
 that you should remain here any longer ; your going 
 to bed would be perfectly excusable, so you can do 
 whatever you like best." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg informed Mrs. Sutton and Miss 
 Drake, (who were waiting for her at the Card Table,) 
 that Colonel Algernon had a bad head-ache ; — men- 
 tioning the circumstance carelessly, as if it was no 
 unusual occurrence. Both Ladies immediately sug- 
 gested a variety of infallible remedies, any of which 
 they were certain would speedily cure him ; but their 
 Hostess declined advising him to have recourse to

 ADELAIDE. 45 
 
 nostrums even thus ably recommended. She observed 
 that * he was already greatly better, and as he appear- 
 ed to be very subject to these kind of attacks, he knew 
 perfectly well how to manage them.' 
 
 The Rubber accordingly began; Sir George was 
 reckoned a very good Whist Player, but his perform- 
 ance upon this occasion was little calculated to main- 
 tain that reputation. He could not fix his attention 
 to the game, he frequently trumped his Partner's 
 Cards, he revoked even more than once ; — and what 
 was yet more singular, Lady Fauconberg did not 
 scold him for making these blunders. 
 
 As Adelaide was left to the undisturbed indulgence 
 of her own reflections, she felt no inclination to profit 
 by her Mother's permission to retire to rest. She 
 placed herself at a small table near a window, where 
 she was tolerably screened from the observation of 
 the Card Party, and pretended to employ herself 
 with some work that lay before her; but her eyes 
 never rested upon the muslin she held in her hand, 
 and her needle remained useless and forgotten between 
 her fingers. Her thoughts were entirely and painfully

 absorbed by the late extraordinary scene, which weigh- 
 ed ujjon her imagination like the fearful remembrance 
 of an appalling Dream. — She could no longer enter- 
 tain a doubt that the unfortunate Spanish Song which 
 had caused Henry's violent agitation, had belonged to 
 some Lady he had once loved ; and she reflected with 
 a feeling of agony upon what must have been the for- 
 mer strength of a passion, the recollection of which 
 could still affect him thus powerfully. — She reproach- 
 ed herself for her cruelty in having sung an air she 
 might have suspected would at least have distressed him. 
 — She felt an ardent curiosity to discover by whose 
 agency the fatal Manuscript could have been placed 
 among her Music Books. — Above all she wondered 
 what could possibly have been the meaning of those 
 dreadful and mysterious insinuations which had es- 
 caped as if unconsciously from his lips during the first 
 unguarded instants of his afflicting surprise. 
 
 Nearly an hour elapsed before Colonel Algernon 
 again made his appearance, and throughout that pe- 
 riod Adelaide could at intervals distinctly hear his 
 hasty and unequal footsteps, as he paced up and down

 before the house. He had recovered his composure, 
 but the deadly paleness that still overspread his fea- 
 tures when he returned, gave evidence of the anguish 
 he had suffered during his absence. 
 
 *' Adelaide," said he, as he seated himself beside 
 her without venturing to look up in her face ; — " I 
 know not what to say to you, — and I dare not even 
 fancy what you must have thought of me." 
 
 " Of You I could think nothing that was unworthy," 
 answered Miss Fauconberg, " but I confess that your 
 extraordinary behaviour has both surprised and dis- 
 tressed me." 
 
 " I have indeed acted like a Madman;" continued 
 Henry; '' when I unexpectedly heard you begin that 
 Song, it drove me literally out of my senses. There - 
 are dreadful recollections connected with it that are 
 indelibly impressed upon my memory, and that ren- 
 der it impossible for me ever to Hsten to it without 
 the most agonizing emotion. — The beautiful and un- 
 fortunate Person at whose desire I wrote out the words 
 that are now in your possession, has long been no 
 more ; her fate was a most horrible one ! — But tell

 me, I beseech you, by what unaccountable means did 
 that ManuscrijDt find its way into your hands ?" 
 
 " That is a question/' repHed Adelaide, " that has 
 puzzled me extremely. I found it this evening among 
 my Music, where I imagined You must have i3ut it ; 
 but I am now perfectly unable to conjecture how or 
 by whom it could have been placed there." 
 
 '' It really seems almost miraculous," said Colonel 
 Algernon thoughtfully. 
 
 '' Can it be possible," enquired Miss Fauconberg, 
 " that your Servant may have stumbled upon this 
 paper in looking over your things, and have officiously 
 laid it where he considered it most likely to be useful?" 
 
 " No, it never belonged to me ; I only copied out 
 the words, and I am sure there could not be the least 
 probability of its having afterwards come in contact 
 with any property of mine." 
 
 " As there seems very little hope," said Adelaide, 
 after a pause, " that we shall either of us succeed in 
 our attempts to discover a satisfactory clue to unravel 
 this mystery, let us give ourselves no more uneasiness 
 upon the subject. This unfortunate Song has already

 tormented us too much ; I believe the wisest thing' we 
 can do, will be to banish the Manuscript and every 
 thing connected with it, entirely from our recollec- 
 tion. — And to prevent the possibility of this intrusive 
 Memorial of your handy work's ever rising up again 
 to disquiet us, I will immediately commit it to the 
 flames." 
 
 She rose, as she concluded these words, and re- 
 moving the paper from her Music Desk, walked up 
 to the Chimney Piece, and threw it into the fire. 
 
 Henry Algernon followed her, but he seemed de- 
 prived of the power of speech while he stood anxiously 
 watching the sheet of paper as it curled itself among 
 the embers, and was slowly consumed by the devour- 
 ing element. 
 
 " Adelaide," exclaimed he at length, " Dearest 
 Adelaide, I feel that without mutual and entire confi- 
 dence the firmest security of continued affection and 
 happiness must be destroyed. — ^\Vhen I first perceived 
 that my wild expressions had excited your suspicion,

 truth. During tlio time I was wandering about out of

 doors, I was anxiously revolving in my mind the ex- 
 pediency, — the possibility, — of doing so. And I am 
 now determined to tell you all^ in spite of every fatal 
 consequence that such a confession may bring down 
 upon myself. — ^There is an unfortunate Secret con- 
 nected with the history of my life which I have 
 hitherto carefully concealed from you, but after what 
 has happened this evening I should not be justified 
 in attempting to hide it any longer, even if I pos- 
 sessed the power of still keeping you in ignorance." 
 
 " I place such unbounded reliance upon your ho- 
 nour and integrity," replied Adelaide, " that I should 
 have felt no desire to pry into any former Secrets 
 you might have been unable or reluctant to commu- 
 nicate to me. — Had you simply told me, when you 
 returned a few minutes ago, that the violent emotion 
 which had surprised and alarmed me, had not been 
 occasioned by any cause that need give me serious 
 uneasiness, — ^I should have been perfectly satisfied 
 with such an assurance ; but after what you have just 
 said, I feel that it is now absolutely necessary to my 
 future peace of mind to be informed of the origin 
 of your distress."

 " You shall know every thing," answered Colonel 
 Algernon, " But remember it is only under a promise 
 of inviolable secrecy, that you are to hear the melan- 
 choly Tale I am going to relate. You must arm 
 your g-entle Spirit to bear a severe shock, and also 
 guard yourself against uttering any sudden exclama- 
 tion of distress that may reach the ears of your Visi- 
 tors, — for I warn you that what I shall be incapable 
 of recounting without great emotion, I am sure you 
 will be unable to listen to without horror." 
 
 " If what I am to hear is so very dreadfiil," said 
 Adelaide, " You shall not tell it to me to-night. My 
 feelings have already been so much agitated this 
 evening in various ways, that I am not certain I 
 should retain the power of commanding them under 
 any new and powerful excitement. — You will youi*self 
 be calmer to-morrow. — ^INIiss Drake has seen more 
 since she has entered this house than she can well 
 understand : if I am not mistaken, her curiosity is 
 roused, and no circumstance, however trifling, that 
 takes place in her presence has the least chance of 
 eluding her o1)servation."

 " You are quite right ; you are always kind and 
 considerate," replied Colonel Algernon, who closed 
 with the proposal of a delay, as a Criminal under 
 sentence for execution would catch at the idea of a 
 reprieve. But the next moment assuming the air of 
 a person who has formed a desperate resolution, and 
 is determined not to shrink from it, — he continued, — 
 
 " The state of cruel suspense in which we are at 
 present placed, is so painful to us both, that it cannot 
 be too speedily brought to a conclusion. It is most 
 desirable upon every account that I should be the first 
 person to infonn you of what concerns myself; — I do 
 not now know liow soon you may learn my history 
 from some one else, nor can I be aware how strangely 
 the details may be aggravated and distorted in other 
 hands. If I remember right, you said that you should 
 go down to your Boudoir before breakfast to-morrow 
 morning. May I join you there ? In that Room we 
 need fear neither remark or intrusion." 
 
 He had not quite finished this sentence when the 
 Whist Party, — who had concluded their last Rubber ; 
 rose from the Card Table. Adelaide had merely

 time to answer in a low voice, " To-morrow morning 
 then I shall expect to hear your promised communi- 
 cation ;" — before she joined Mrs. Sutton who was 
 advancing" towards her. She endeavoured to put on 
 an air of indifference, and asked her some common- 
 place questions about the success of the game. 
 
 Miss Drake assailed Colonel Algernon with endless 
 and perplexing enquiries about his head ache : — And 
 both Sisters united in lamenting how very pale and 
 ill it had made him look. Sir George said nothing, 
 — ^Lady Fauconberg very little, — but Henry was 
 painfully conscious that he was subjected to the severe 
 Ordeal of her scrutinizing eye. Adelaide also was so 
 well aware that her Mother's keen glance was from 
 time to time directed towards Aer, that she felt 
 greatly relieved when her Ladyship at length pro- 
 posed to her Guests to retire to rest 
 
 Miss Fauconberg had much need of repose, yet 
 her mind was so greatly harrassed and oppressed with 
 fearful and mysterious apprehensions, that she found 
 it impossible to sleep ; and when she did at last close 
 her eyes, she was haunted by such horrible Dreams,

## p. 54 (#68) ##############################################


 
 54 ADELAIDE. 
 
 that she wakened terrified instead of refreshed, hy 
 her uneasy slumbers. The day was beginning to 
 dawn, and as she had no wish to dream again she 
 rose, dressed herseh', and thinking it much too early 
 to go down Stairs to her Boudoir, — she seated herself 
 at the window to watch the rising Sun. It must be 
 confessed that her object was rather to mark the pro- 
 gress of time, than to admire the Glorious Luminary 
 that was just making its appearance in an unclouded 
 Sky, — ^yet the magnificence of the Spectacle insen- 
 sibly elevated her thoughts, and diverted them from 
 those subjects which had hitherto so painfully en- 
 gi'ossed them. Her mind became tranquillized, and 
 she had fallen into an agreable sort of reverie, when 
 she was startled by hearing some one hastily enter 
 her Sitting Room below. 
 
 At first she imagined it must be the Housemaid, 
 but the rapid footsteps of the person who seemed to 
 be impatiently traversing the Apartment, soon sug- 
 gested another conjecture ; — She fancied it was Henry 
 Algernon, whose eagerness to relieve her suspense 
 and to vindicate himself fi'om all appearance of blame,

 had induced him to leave his Couch at this imusual 
 hour ; and she beUeved he was now fretting and dis- 
 quieting himself at finding it was still so early. 
 
 Adelaide hesitated for a few moments : she did not 
 feel sure if it would be quite right to join even Colo- 
 nel Algernon at such a time, and to meet him in what 
 had very much the air of a clandestine manner; — 
 Yet she considered that her Parents had given the 
 fullest sanction to her Engagement. The circum-: 
 stances she were placed in were peculiar, and she 
 determined not to prolong Henry's anxiety by allows 
 ing herself to be influenced by what was perhaps 
 only an unnecessary scruple. > 
 
 Her resolution was no sooner taken than acted upon. 
 She went down stairs, and when she opened the dooc 
 of her Boudoir she was both surprised and disap- 
 pointed to find nobody there. The shutters of one of 
 the windows had been unclosed, the sash had also 
 been thrown up, and as she entered the Room she 
 fancied she caught a glympse of the departing Sha- 
 dow of a Figure resembling Colonel Algernon's, 
 reflected upon the Lawn.

 56 ADELAIDE. 
 
 She hastened forward with the intention of recal- 
 ling him, but if he had passed that way he must have 
 flown, for when she reached the window he had 
 already disappeared beyond the Angle of the House. 
 She walked out upon the flags, but not the slightest 
 trace of any living Creature was to be seen, — and 
 she began to doubt if the Shadow that had seemed to 
 flit before her eyes, had not been entirely conjured 
 up by her imagination. An instant's reflection con- 
 vinced her, however, that she had not been deceived, 
 and she lingered with a vain hope of beholding Henry 
 very speedily come back. This ex23ectation grew weak- 
 er and weaker by degrees, and at length gave place to a 
 melancholy apprehension that he was gone to return 
 no more. She retraced her steps to her deserted 
 Boudoir, and sat down upon the Sofa; her spirits, 
 which had been shaken by the violent agitation she 
 had suffered the night before, — now entirely gave 
 way, and she burst into tears ! 
 
 Adelaide did not very long allow herself to indulge 
 unavailing sorrow. She was not sure that the cala- 
 mity she dreaded, might not after all prove visionary,

 ADELAIDE. 57 
 
 — and she carefully examined every object around 
 her as if she expected to find something- that might 
 explain the mystery that so fearfully perplexed her. 
 
 Her room remained exactly in the same state in 
 which she had left it the previous day, — every piece 
 of furniture occupied its usual position, — but she ob- 
 served that one of the China Vases had been taken 
 from the Chimney Piece, and the Flowers it con- 
 tained had been either shaken out in the removal or 
 overturned afterwards, for they were lying scattered 
 beside it upon the table. She started up to look at 
 them more closely, and had just ascertained that some 
 of the Roses had been taken away, — when she per- 
 ceived a Letter that was more than half concealed 
 under those that w ere left. Adelaide seized it with 
 trembling eagerness : it was addressed to herself, and 
 the direction though in an altered and agitated hand, 
 had evidently been written by Henry Algernon. She 
 tore open the Seal, but she had not read many words 
 when she staggered back to the Sofa, the paper drop- 
 ped from her powerless grasp, and she fainted. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg did not recover for some time,

## p. 58 (#72) ##############################################


 
 58 ADELAIDE. 
 
 and it was much longer before she distinctly recol- 
 lected where she was, and what had happened to her. 
 When the whole truth at length returned to her mind, 
 she anxiously sought for the unfinished Letter, and 
 it is impossible to describe the feeUngs with which 
 she read the following incomprehensible Lines. 
 
 " My ever dearest Adelaide, 
 
 Though I feel almost incapable of expres- 
 sing myself intelligibly, I cannot depart from Fau-

 Before you discover what I now endeavour to write, 
 you will I have no doubt have been informed that I 
 
 have torn myself away from you -for ever ! 
 
 I have had a long and painful explanation with 
 Sir George : You will hear from him the melancholy 
 Story I intended to have communicated to you, — and 
 it is a consolation to me in my wretchedness to believe 
 that You will pity me. — I am cut to the heart by the 
 view your Father has taken of my misfortune. I 
 cannot help thinking that he has judged me much 
 more severely than the nature of the circumstances

 required him to do, — but as I am persuaded he was 
 only influenced by his anxiety for Your happiness, I 
 must submit to my own fate without murmuring. 
 
 The pang" that at this moment afflicts me most 
 keenly, is the idea of the distress I know you wiH so 
 soon suffer upon my account. I implore you to for- 
 give this, as well as all the former grief and uneasiness 
 I have occasioned you. Could I have foreseen that 
 I should have brought upon You any share of those 
 evils which in various forms have pursued me from 
 the hour of my birth, I can sincerely assure you that 
 I would rather have died than have endeavoured to 
 obtain your affection. Your future destiny is now 
 disunited from mine, and I fervently hope that in the 
 course of time you will regain that comfort and peace 
 of mind with which you were so eminently blessed 
 
 when I first knew you. For myself, — I scarcely 
 
 know where I am going, or what will become of me; 
 and I dare not even think of the long years of despair 
 and misery that may yet be before me. — Adelaide, 
 Adelaide, when I reflect that I have seen you for the 
 last time, I feel as if my rciison was about to forsake

 me ; the bitterness of such a sei3aratioii is ahnost 
 more than I am able to bear. Even the soothing hope 
 of meeting you hereafter in a happier World, cannot 
 yet reconcile me to parting with you in this. I be- 
 seech you to pray that I may be supported under so 
 great a trial, for no one ever needed such support 
 more truly than the miserable and unfortunate 
 
 Henry Algernon." 
 
 Adelaide was completely crushed and bewildered 
 by the severity of the blow that had thus unexpect- 
 edly fallen upon her. While she was vainly endea- 
 vouring to conjecture what could possibly have been 
 the cause that had occasioned Colonel Algernon's ex- 
 traordinary departure, — a dreadful idea suddenly 
 suggested itself to her imagination. Could Henry 
 have been afflicted with a temporary attack of mental 
 derangement .' The wildness of his manner and his 
 expressions the night before, — the dark insinuations 
 thrown out in his incomprehensible Letter, and above 
 all the fancy by which he seemed continually haunt- 
 ed, that some Evil Genius was connnissioned to pur-

 sue him unrelentingly and destroy his happiness, — all 
 tended to confirm the probability of such a supposi- 
 tion. 
 
 When she reflected that the air and words of the 
 unfortunate Spanish Song-, by jarring upon some 
 tender Chord, might perhaps have been instrumental 
 in bringing on a paroxysm of a malady from which 
 she had no means of knowing that he had not suffered 
 at some fonner period, — ^her feelings became almost 
 too painful for endurance. 
 
 She remained in her Boudoir unconscious of the 
 advance of time, and when Lady Fauconberg at length 
 came to look for her, she was inexpressibly shocked 
 at the sad alteration that was visible in her Daughter's 
 whole appearance.

 LadyFauconberg had concluded all her active morn- 
 ing occupations, and liad established herself in the 
 Library to await the arrival of Mrs. Sutton and Miss 
 Drake, when she perceived Sir George returning home 
 from his ride. 
 
 As soon as the Baronet entered the House, his Ser- 
 vant gave him a Sealed Packet which he said had 
 been left for him an hour before by a Stranger who 
 refused to give his name, and hinted that he required 
 no answer. 
 
 Sir George ran his eye hastily over the direc-

 tioii, and upon asking what kind of looking per- 
 son the Stranger was ? the Servant described him as 
 a shabby-genteel sort of Man who appeared much 
 like a Foreigner. He observed that he had advised 
 him, ' if he had any business with his Master to await 
 his return, as he was only gone out riding ;' but this 
 the Stranger had positively refused to do ; adding, 
 '' If Sir George Fauconberg makes any enquiries 
 about me, you may tell him that I am a Stranger 
 who has travelled a very long distance on purpose to 
 convey the Packet I have brought for him, — and that 
 having accomplished my errand, I shall now return 
 to my own place of abode as speedily as possible." 
 The Baronet imagined that the Letter thus left for 
 him contained some Begging Petition or Appeal for 
 assistance ; — there was a degree of mystery connected 
 with the way in which it had been delivered that ra- 
 ther excited his curiosity ^ and he lost no time in break- 
 ing the Seal. The Enveloppe contained two large- 
 sized sheets of paper folded up together, and closely 
 covered with wiiting in a neat, cramped, foreign- 
 looking hand ; — and also several other Enclosures

 apparently of diiferent dates and descriptions. In the 
 first he had Uttle doubt he should find a touching Tale 
 of Misfortune, or piteous Case of Distress ; while its 
 companions had very much the air of Testimonials of 
 Character, and Attestations of the Narrator's veracity. 
 
 Sir George examined the principal Document with 
 the manner of a person who had more inclination to 
 skim its contents than to read it regularly to the end ; 
 but before he had had time to get half way down the 
 first page, it was evident he had found something that 
 interested him in no common degree,— -the expres- 
 sion of his countenance was completely changed, and 
 he pursued his study with deep and apparently pain- 
 ful attention. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg who had sat watching her Hus- 
 band with eager curiosity, could not at length resist 
 asking him what Papers those were that he was read- 
 ing so carefully ? Observing, that if she were to judge 
 from the cloud that hung upon his brow, their con- 
 tents could not be of a very agreable nature ; and 
 concluding with a hope that the Lawyers had not 
 started any new difficulties or delays in completing 
 the adjustment of the Marriage Settlements.

 Sir George, who scarcely seemed to have heard the 
 commenceineut of this address, raised his head as she 
 spoke the last words, and replied in a tone of unusual 
 impatience, , 
 
 "Do not talk to me of MaiTiage Settlements at 
 this moment. And let me request you to ask me no 
 more questions, for I am much too deeply engaged 
 just now to be able to attend to them." 
 
 Her Ladyship was never very easily silenced, and 
 as she immediately commenced another attack. Sir 
 George rose from his chair. 
 
 " Lady Fauconberg," said he, '' I have already 
 told you that I will not be interrupted. You will 
 know the contents of these Papers soon enough, and 
 since you will not allow me to study them quietly 
 here, I must retire to my own Room where I shall at 
 least be secure from disturbance." 
 
 A long time elapsed before the Baronet returned ; 
 when he did come, he still looked sorrowful, but his 
 manner was completely softened. He requested Lady 
 Fauconberg to forgive the harshness with which he 
 had spoken when he left her ; and after a short ex-

 planation of the circumstances connected with the 
 arrival of the mysterious Packet, — He put the follow- 
 ing extraordinary Narrative into her hands. 
 
 ''' Sir George Fauconberg will I apprehend feel 
 considerably surprised at being addressed by a perfect 
 Stranger upon a subject so delicate as his own private 
 and domestic connections ; but I trust he will give me 
 credit for sincerity when I say that nothing could 
 have tempted me to venture upon the liberty I am 
 about to take, but an ardent desire to avert if possible 
 from another the danger of suffering misfortunes simi- 
 lar to those I have long endured, and which must 
 continue to embitter the remaining years of my 
 wretched life. 
 
 My unhappy Story may be briefly told. — I am by 
 birth a Spaniard, my name is Antonio de Lerma, 
 and before the fiend-like ambition of Napoleon spread 
 destruction and misery over my devoted Country, I 
 was one of the wealthiest and most respected Mer- 
 chants of my native City. 
 
 I had lost my Wife very soon after our marriage,

 but her place in 1113^ affections had in time been sup- 
 plied by our only Daughter, — my beautiful, charm- 
 ing", and accomplished Basilia. All my leisure hours 
 were spent in her society, and while it gratified my 
 pride to see her surrounded b}- a crowd of Admirers, 
 — so great was my horror at the idea of parting with 
 her, that I could not help feeling a selfish sort of plea- 
 sure at perceiving that no one of her most devoted 
 Suitors had yet been able to make the slightest im- 
 pression upon her heart. 
 
 The rumours of an approaching French Invasion 
 gave me great uneasiness, and the subsequent ac- 
 counts of its actual commencement and progress, filled 
 my mind with grief and alarm; — but no language 
 can express my consternation and dismay, when I 
 learnt that a large Body of the Enemy's Force had 
 arrived within a few leagues of my hitherto peace- 
 ful home, and was in full march towards our Town. 
 
 The dangers that menaced my Daughter, did not 
 permit me to hesitate one moment; I contrived to 
 conceal some part of my most valuable property, — 
 packed up my jewels and my money, — and leaving

 the rest of my possessions to their fate, — escaped witli 
 my greatest treasure, my beloved Child, to a secure 
 hiding- place in the Mountains. 
 
 We did not venture to leave our Retreat till we 
 received certain and repeated information that our 
 ruthless Invaders had removed to a distant part of the 
 Country. 
 
 I need scarcely describe the scene of ruin and deso- 
 lation that presented itself to our view when we re- 
 turned to our deserted Dwelling. The walls of my 
 House remained indeed entire, but every room w^as 
 discoloured with smoke and dirt, the furniture was 
 all either carried awa}^ or destroyed, the Cellars had 
 been broken open and emptied, and every corner had 
 been explored in search of plunder. Still when I 
 looked around me and compared my losses with those 
 of very many of my neighbours, I felt I had abundant 
 reason to be thankful ; and as my secreted property 
 had been undiscovered by the Spoilers, I soon con- 
 trived, with Basilia's assistance, to restore my Abode 
 to a comj^arative state of elegance. 
 
 Some months after this first destructive visitation,

 we received iiitelUgence of the approach of a part of 
 the Army of our English Allies; and it appeared 
 probable that they might remain with us for a longer 
 period than the savage Frenchmen had done. Such 
 news occasioned no terror ; we did not abandon our 
 Abodes, but staid at home to welcome the brave Sol- 
 diers who were coming to aid us to avenge our 
 wrongs, and drive our common Enemy with igno- 
 miny fi'om our soil. 
 
 My beautiful BasiHa was at that time just seven- 
 teen; like all her Countrywomen she detested the 
 Invaders, and in proportion as this feeling had been 
 heightened by her own recent hardships and the 
 sufferings of her Friends, her admiration for the 
 character of the English had been augmented. 
 
 The British Force arrived, and we learnt that a 
 part of it was composed of the King of England's 
 Royal Guard. In the distribution of Quarters, several 
 of the foreign Officers became my Guests. Among 
 these were two Cousins whose family appellation was 
 Algernon, and who were as perfectly ahke in appear- 
 ance, as they were dissimilar in disposition and cha-

 racier. Horace, whom we termed the Fiery, — was 
 violent, impetuous, vindictive, and unprincipled ; — 
 while Henry, who was distinguished by the title of the 
 Engaging — was brave, gentle, insinuating and amiable. 
 
 The circumstance seemed so natural, and was of 
 such common occurrence, that it gave me no surprise 
 very speedily to discover that both the Cousins were 
 desperately in love with my Daughter. If I some- 
 times observed her smile more graciously upon the 
 attentions of the Engaging English Youth, than she 
 was wont to do upon those of her own Countrymen ; 
 I attributed such marks of favour merely to the poli- 
 tical enthusiasm of the moment : — I was far from sus- 
 pecting the danger that was preparing to burst upon 
 me and destroy my domestic happiness ! 
 
 It appears that the handsome and accomplished 
 Stranger had very soon contrived to win Basilia's 
 affections ; and justly apprehending that he should 
 never be able to obtain my consent to her Union with 
 a Foreigner, he had also, in an evil hour persuaded 
 my poor misguided Child to agree to the celebration 
 of a private marriage. He told her that such a step

 alone, could prevent their being separated for ever, — 
 and that it would likewise at once relieve her from the 
 persecution she had been obliged to endure from his 
 Cousin. What might have been his ultimate plans 
 anl intentions I shall never know ? I can scarcely 
 think he could have been so heartless a Villain as to 
 dream of abandoning my Daughter to her fate, when- 
 ever his military duty called him away from her 
 Father's house. — The fatal Tragedy that speedily 
 followed their ill-starred Union, has left all this in 
 doubt and obscurity. 
 
 Basilia did not dare to confess to me the clandestine 
 engagement she had contracted, but the sense of her 
 undutiful conduct and of the deception she was prac- 
 tising towards me, preyed heavily upon her Spirits. 
 This was not the only distress she was doomed to 
 suflfer : Her Fiery Admirer was rendered furious by 
 his disappointment, and vowed vengeance loud and 
 deep, both against her and his successful and now 
 detested Rival. 
 
 Whenever the latter was not present, he tormented 
 her with assiduities which her dread of exasperating

 him still fuilher, prevented her receiving with out- 
 ward disdain. 
 
 He lost no opportunity of endeavouring to sow the 
 seeds of distrust and jealousy towards her in her Hus- 
 band's mind,— and unfortunately his wicked arts were 
 not entirely exerted without effect. In short, her 
 situation became altogether so painful and emban-as- 
 sing, that she was sometimes scarcely able to conceal 
 the grief and anxiety that constantly depressed her. 
 
 Basilia played extremely well upon the Guitar. 
 She had a clear, beautiful voice, and when this ac^ 
 companied the Instrument, it was delightful to listen 
 to her Singing. 
 
 The Engaging Algernon had a taste for Music, and 
 seemed as if he never could be tired of hearing hers ; 
 he often sung with her, and took great pleasure in 
 learning all her National Airs. There was one in 
 particular, — a plaintive, melancholy Tune, to which 
 he had assisted her in adapting some Original Words; 
 which was so decidedly his favorite, that had she only 
 remembered tliat^ I believe he would have been satis- 
 fied to allow her to forget all other Songs. Owing

 to some jealous misunderstanding between him and 
 his Cousin, he had requested and obtained from her 
 a promise, very early in their acquaintance, that she 
 would never sing his favorite air to any one but him- 
 self, or at his desire. 
 
 I happened to be talking to my Daughter one 
 morning, when the Fiery Englishman entered the 
 room ; He told us that he was going into the Country 
 upon JNlilitary business which would probably detain 
 him for some days, and that he now presented him- 
 self, to take leave of us before his departure. Perhaps 
 my poor Basilia's expressive countenance betrayed 
 that this intelligence gave her any thing but displea- 
 sure ; for his manner suddenly changed, he stopped 
 short in his unfinished compliment, and a withering 
 and malicious smile played for an instant upon his 
 proud and handsome lip. 
 
 I saw little more of my beloved and unhappy Child 
 that day. I had been invited by one of my Friends 
 and Neighbours to an Entertainment given to some 
 of the Foreign Officers, among the number of whom 
 the two Al'-ernons had been included.

 Basilia, as I afterwards learnt, spent the early part 
 of the evening- alone ; the weather was fine, and she 
 had just seated herself in the Verandah and taken up 
 her Guitar to beguile the tedious hours, — when the 
 door of the Apartment opened gently, and she was 
 agreably surprised at seeing" her Husband make his 
 aj^pearance. 
 
 He was wrapped in his Military Cloak, and his air 
 seemed more serious and thoughtful than might have 
 been expected in a person who had just left a scene 
 of festivity. 
 
 She rose to greet him, but as he approached the 
 Verandah, he told her ' he was not come to interrupt, 
 but to listen to her Music,' and requested she would 
 indulge him by singing his own beautiful favorite Air, 
 
 His wish was instantly complied with. Basilia was 
 conscious that she sung with moro than usual feeling 
 and pathos, and her Companion hung over her in 
 deep and silent admiration. When the Song was 
 concluded he seated himself beside her, — ^his arm had 
 encircled her waist, — when she was suddenly startled 
 by observing the shadow of another Military Figure

 ill the moonlight. She turned to discover who the 
 Intruder could he ? And in so doing she caught a 
 full view of the features of him whom she had sup- 
 jiosed to he the Engaging Algernon. 
 
 She became nearly jDetrified with astonishment and 
 dismay when she perceived that the partial darkness, 
 the similarity of voice and manner, and above all the 
 very strong family likeness had deceived her ; and 
 that it was her Fiery Tormentor who had dared to 
 invade her solitude, and had been treacherously lis- 
 tening to Strains which he was well aware were not 
 intended for his ear. 
 
 To complete her distress, she saw her Husband, 
 (who had entered the room unheard,) standing at a 
 little distance attentively watching her and her Com- 
 panion ; his arms were folded, and his countenance 
 was actually distorted with rage. 
 
 Poor Basilia uttered a funt shriek, and started 
 from her seat. Unhappily her first Visitor had placed 
 his Pistols upon a table close to the position his Cousin 
 had chosen; Henry's eye glanced upon them, and 
 giving way to a furious paroxysm of jealousy, he

 snatched up one of the weapons an.l discharged it with 
 too fatally sure an aim. The hall just grazed his 
 unprhicipled Relation and mortally wounded his in- 
 nocent and injured Wife. 
 
 The instant the deed was done, the Wretched Man 
 was seized with all the agonies of remorse and hor- 
 ror. Even the Fiend whose malicious arts had driven 
 him to desperation, was shocked at a catastrophe so 
 much more dreadful than any thing he had antici- 
 pated, — and he aggravated his Cousin's despair by 
 confessing his own villainy and completely exone- 
 rating his Victim from hlame. 
 
 As my ill-fated Basilia had swooned, they imagined 
 her to be dead ; but when they raised her from the 
 ground, they perceived faint symptoms of returning 
 animation. Neither of her Companions were in a 
 state to render her very judicious assistance, they 
 contrived, however, to place her upon a Sofa, anl to 
 stop the effusion of blood. 
 
 As soon as she became sensible of what had passed, 
 she assured them both of her forgiveness, — and en- 
 deavoured with angelic composure to soothe and

 comfort her frantic Husband. She said ' she felt 
 tliat her untimely fate was a punishment she had 
 brought uiDon herself by her undutiful behaviom* to 
 her Father;' And she earnestly requested I might 
 immediately be sent for, as she could not leave the 
 world in peace until she had made me a fidl confes- 
 sion of her Marriage, and implored me to grant her 
 my pardon and my blessing. — She protested that it 
 was in vain to think of calling in Medical Aid, as she 
 knew it was beyond the power of human skill to save 
 her ; and she only desired that she might be allowed 
 to remain where she was during the very few hours 
 she could expect to live. 
 
 I cannot attempt to describe the scene that took 
 place after I was summoned to attend the death-bed 
 of my dear and only Child, my tenderly beloved 
 Basilia ! 
 
 Every look of hers, every word that she spoke, arc 
 indelibly stamped upon my recollection, they haunt 
 me sleeping, and awake, and I can never think of 
 them without agony ! 
 
 She gave me a circumstantial account of all the

 circumstances that had preceded and followed her 
 unhappy Marriage, — And she succeeded in prevailing 
 upon me to extend to her miserable Husband the 
 pardon I had readily accorded to herself. She even 
 extorted from me a promise that I would not only 
 forgive the injuries I had received from him, but that 
 I would also endeavour for her sake to regard him 
 with kindness and compassion. 
 
 When all was over, I caused a report to be circu- 
 lated that my unfortunate Daughter had accidentally 
 received a death wound from the Engaging Alger- 
 non while he was amusing himself by firing Pistols at 
 a Mark ; and improbable as this Story may appear, it 
 was at the time very easily believed by all my Neigh- 
 bours. 
 
 After what had happened it was of course impos- 
 sible for either of the Cousins to remain longer under 
 my roof. 
 
 The wretched Widower was removed to another 
 habitation in a state of furious and passionate despair. 
 The violence of his mental anguish brought on a 
 brain fever, — and for some time his life was consi-

 dered in the greatest danger. The disease at lengtli 
 began to give way, but he still continued to be so 
 heavil}' oppressed with misery and despondency, that 
 his recovery seemed almost a misfortune to himself. 
 
 During the period when his illness was thought dan- 
 gerous, his conscience-stricken Cousin had watched 
 over him with the utmost attention. An appearance 
 of outward civility and kindness was afterwards re- 
 established between them, but their Friends observed 
 that thev contrived to find themselves as little toofe- 
 ther as possible. 
 
 In compliance with the promise I had given to my 
 Child, I paid the poor Invalid several visits as soon 
 as I had ascertained that he was sufiiciently convales- 
 cent to be able to see me with safety. I bore him no 
 malice, but I could not look upon him without feeling 
 a bitter renewal of affliction ; and I experienced a 
 great relief when the Regiment he belonged to, was 
 ordered to advance against the Enemy. All the 
 English Troops were withdrawn from our Town, and 
 during the varied chances of the War I had not once 
 the curiosity to enquire what had been the fate of a

 Person whose very name I ardently wished that I 
 possessed the power of obhterating from my memory. 
 
 It was so painful to me to continue to inhabit an 
 Abode where every object reminded me of my former 
 happiness, and recalled in a thousand forms the image 
 of my dear lamented Basilia ; — that I disposed of my 
 house and furniture, and established myself at a small 
 Villa I had purchased in the Country. I was too 
 completely broken-hearted ever to wish to engage 
 again in any Commercial concerns upon my own ac- 
 count, but some months ago I was tempted to think 
 of leaving my solitude once more, — and even to un- 
 dertake a voyage to England to assist in settling some 
 Mercantile affairs of great importance to one of my , 
 oldest and dearest Friends. 
 
 While 1 was in London I chanced to hear a Stranger 
 mention the name of Colonel Henry Algernon ; an 
 instinctive curiosity led me to listen attentively to the 
 conversation that followed, and I soon learnt that the 
 Youth whom it had been my misfortune to receive as 
 my Guest, had risen to honour and distinction in the 
 world, and was upon the point of being united to a

 . beautiful young Heiress, the only Child of a Gentle- 
 man of rank and consequence. 
 
 This intelligence gave me an indescribable and 
 sickening sensation! Was it possible that Colonel 
 Algernon could have succeeded in lulling the pangs 
 of remorse, — in silencing the voice of self-reproach, 
 — and in regaining that happiness and peace of mind 
 which I had believed he never could again expe- 
 rience ? — Could he have so completely forgotten the 
 first dear Object of his affection, — She who had loved 
 him with so much devotion, — who had sacrificed every 
 thing for his sake, — and who had fallen an early Vic- 
 tim to his rash and groundless suspicions; — as to 
 think of marrying another ? — All this seemed so ex- 
 traordinary, so incomprehensible, — that I could scarce-^ 
 ly bring myself to credit its being actually true. 
 
 I began to wonder what sort of Person the future 
 Bride might be whom he had selected to supply the 
 blank which the loss of my poor Daughter had left in 
 his heart ? — I imaghied her beautiful, amiable, inno- 
 cent, and confiding as my own charming Basilia was 
 when first he saw her. — I fancied the reluctance and

 sorrow her Parents must feel at the prosjiect of part- 
 ing with such a Treasure ; but I did not allow my 
 
 anticipations to go further, I dared not picture 
 
 the anguish and despair her Father and her Mother 
 must endure if they should discover when it was too 
 late, that the early errors and misfortunes of Him 
 upon whom they had bestowed their jDrecious Child, 
 had completely blighted all her hopes of happiness. 
 
 Colonel Algernon was intended by Nature to be all 
 that is excellent. His misfortunes render him every 
 way deserving of pity ; but the Curse of Cain is upon 
 his brow, that Malediction must extend its baneful 
 and withering influence to every body connected with 
 him ; and with this consciousness upon his mind, his 
 conduct has been neither generous or honorable if he 
 has sought to gain the affections and to obtain the 
 hand of a Second Wife, without having previously 
 communicated to Her and to her Family, the melan- 
 choly and disastrous Story of his First Marriage. 
 
 Should he have acted a more open and candid part 
 than the one I have been led to attribute to him, my

 cannot prove in the slightest degree prejudicial to him. 
 Nor would any Young Lady who had brought her- 
 self to consent to accept as her future Husband a man 
 whose right hand had been stained, however unhap- 
 pily, — with the life-blood of an unoffending former 
 Wife, find any thing to agitate her spirits or to shake 
 her resolution, in the perusal of such a Narrative as 
 mine. 
 
 If, as I strongly suspect. Miss Fauconberg and her 
 Parents have been kept in ignorance of the circum- 
 stances I have related, I shall at least have given 
 them timely warning of the danger that may be 
 apprehended from an Alliance with Colonel Alger- 
 non. I feel that it is my imperative duty to do so, 
 and whatever construction may be put upon my mo- 
 tives, I will not shrink from perfonning it. How 
 they may be influenced by my communication I 
 know not ? The effect it may produce upon their 
 feelings,— or in what manner they may be inclined 
 to act in consequence of receiving it, I shall probably 
 never learn ; and at all events it must be a considera- 
 tion of the most perfect indifference to Me.

 In disclosing my own son-ows I can only be desi- 
 rous of guarding- others from calamity ; and I am so 
 anxious that what I have written should reach Sir 
 George Fauconberg with speed and safety, that as 1 
 am not exactly aware of the nature and security of 
 the English Posts, I have determined to make a 
 journey into the Province where I am told he re- 
 sides, that I may convey my Packet to his House 
 with my own hands. 
 
 The arrangement of the transactions that brought 
 me to England, is now concluded, and the moment 
 I have accomplished this last Object, I shall set sail 
 for my Native Land, and hasten to re-establish my- 
 self in my solitude, where I trust I shall be permitted 
 to remain undisturbed during the rest of my joyless 
 days. 
 
 As the circumstances I have related, rest entirely 
 upon mj' own testimony, — ^I have enclosed two short 
 Notes which I found among my poor Daughter's 
 treasured possessions. They were written to her by 
 the too Engaging Algernon just after their fatal mar- 
 riage ; the Spanish is not very correct, but whoever

 reads them will perceive that he addresses Basilia as 
 his Wife. I have also added with these, her own 
 Copy of that favorite Air I have so particularly 
 alluded to, the words of which were transcribed for her 
 by her Husband. Should he happen accidentally 
 to hear any one sing^ that Song, I will venture to 
 affinn that the recollections it would recal, and the 
 agonizing sensations it would occasion him to betray, 
 — would aftbrd a stronger confirmation of the horrible 
 Catastrophe it was instrumental in bringing on, than 
 any other proof I could possibly attempt to produce. 
 
 My Story is concluded. IMy painful and unwel- 
 come task will soon be performed. And it now only 
 remains for me to wish very sincerely, a restoration 
 and continuance of prosperity and happiness to those 
 to whom I much fear I must occasion uneasiness and 
 distress."

 During the time Lady Fauconberg was reading 
 Don Antonio de Lerma's Letter, Sir George had 
 remained perfectly silent, but as soon as she had 
 finished it, gone back to it, taken it up, and finally 
 laid it down again, — he asked her what she thought 
 of that very extraordinary communication ? 
 
 '' It is a most horrible Story ?" replied her Lady- 
 ship, shuddering as she spoke, " and I feel we can 
 never be sufficiently grateful for the escape our dear 
 Adelaide has made. It freezes my blood when I 
 consider that if any accident had delayed the arrival

 of this packet a few weeks longer, she would have 
 been indissolubly united to a Murderer / " 
 
 " Poor dear Child," said Sir Geors-e in a voice of 
 deep anguish, " how will she be able to support the 
 dreadful, the unexpected shock that awaits her ?" 
 
 Then suddenly changing his tone, he enquired, — 
 '' You consider the Spaniard's History then entirely 
 worthy of belief?" 
 
 " I wish I could do otherwise, but it is so naturally 
 and circumstantially told that I can discover no pos- 
 sible reason to doubt its truth." — After a pause her 
 Ladyship added; — " The unhappy Father is evi- 
 dently determined to avoid all further intercourse 
 with us upon a subject that must be so painful to 
 himself; but since you do not seem to be satisfied 
 about the veracity of the information he has given 
 us, it appears to me that it would not be very difficult 
 to obtain testimony to confirm or invalidate it from 
 other sources. Any of the Officers who were in the 
 same Regiment of Guards with the two Algernons, 
 and served with them Abroad at the precise period 
 alluded to, might surely bo able to recollect if such

 remarkable circumstances as the beautiful Spanish 
 Lady's unfortunate death, and Henry Algernon's 
 consequent and desperate illness ever actually took 
 place." 
 
 " Certainly they might," replied Sir George, " I 
 am resolved to use every means in my power to in- 
 vestigate this matter carefully and impartially. Don 
 Antonio states that he has been deeply injured, his 
 evidence cannot therefore be unprejudiced. He may 
 deceive himself ^ but it is very plain to me that if he 
 had not been actuated by feelings of revenge and 
 anger, he would not have taken so much trouble to 
 convey his Packet to Fauconberg. I confess that I 
 know not how to discredit his Narrative ; during the 
 last ten minutes, various little incidents connected 
 with Henry's conduct have occurred to my memory 
 to strengthen its probability. — One dreadfully con- 
 clusive circumstance in particular, has just flashed 
 across my mind, which seems to place Colonel Al- 
 gernon's having really perpetrated the horrible deed 
 ascribed to him, almost beyond a doubt. — I allude to 
 the very extraoi'dinary emotion he betrayed when he

 was once litling with us in the Park, on iiearing" me 
 accidentally relate the history of an unfortunate 
 Young Man who had killed his innocent Wife in a 
 fit of jealousy. He was so violently affected that 
 both Adelaide and I were much struck with his be- 
 haviour at the moment, and we talked it over after- 
 wards in our way home. At the same time we must 
 recollect that we are yet only acquainted with one 
 side of the question, and that we ought not to con- 
 demn any person without having first heard what he 
 has to say in his own defence. On a former occa- 
 sion, and when the supposed offence was of a much 
 less serious nature, I judged Colonel Algernon to be 
 guilty because the strongest and most suspicious ap- 
 pearances led me to imagine that he was so. But I 
 was then mistaken, — and I am determined that I will 
 
 not now do him similar injustice." 
 
 " What steps do you intend to take ?" asked Lady 
 
 Fauconberg, " For of course it will be both desirable 
 
 and necessary to clear up this business as speedily 
 
 as possible." 
 
 " In the first place I shall shew the contents of

 the Packet I have received to Henry Algernon, — and 
 require him upon his honour to tell me how much, or 
 if any part of Antonio de Lerma's statement is cor- 
 rect." 
 
 " Surely Sir George," exclaimed her Ladyship, 
 " You cannot seriously think of doing any thing so 
 injudicious. Colonel Algernon would have no scru- 
 ple in denying what his honour has not forbidden him 
 to conceal, — or at least he would only confess just as 
 much as he was aware you might be able to prove 
 against him. Remember that although the fact of 
 poor Basilia's death was obliged to be published, the 
 real circumstances that occasioned her untimely end 
 were never known by any body but her Father and 
 the two x\lgernons. They have been revealed to us 
 by the former, but we can scarcely expect to obtain a 
 decided acknowledgment of them from either of the 
 latter. If you bring an open accusation at once be- 
 fore Henry, he may easily contrive to evade it and to 
 avoid criminating himself ; any information you can 
 hope to gain, must be drawn from him more indi- 
 rectly, and when he is thrown off his guard. Why

 should we not for instance tiy the experiment sug- 
 gested by the Spaniard, and see what effect would be 
 produced upon him by hearing the Song he had for- 
 merly so much pleasure in listening to P" 
 
 " No," replied the Baronet, " that would be an 
 unfeeling trick that shall never be resorted to with 
 my approbation or consent. I will, as you advise, 
 commence my attack by leading Henry to talk of his 
 Spanish Campaigns, and endeavouring to make him 
 give me an account of his acquaintance and connec- 
 tion with the de Lerma Family, before I demand of 
 him a more direct explanation of the heavy charges 
 that have been prefen-ed against him. — But," con- 
 cluded Sir George, with a sigh, " it will be no easy 
 or agreable task to set about so delicate a business ; 
 or to know how to persuade a Man in civil terms to 
 be kind enough to inform me if he has murdered his 
 own Wife/' 
 
 Belbre Lady Fauconberg had time to make any 
 rejoinder, she descried a carriage driving up to the 
 door ; She gave her Husband warning of the imme- 
 diate approach of Mrs. Sutton and Miss Drake, and

 Sir George who felt at that moment quite incapable 
 of encountering them, — hastily snatched up his papers 
 and made his escape, leaving his Lady to entertain 
 their Guests. 
 
 She had been so much affected by all she had just 
 learnt, that she did not find it easy to regain her 
 usual self-possession, — but having pleaded a stupi- 
 fying head-ache as an excuse for the evident opjn'es- 
 sion under which she laboured, she contrived to carry 
 off appearances tolerably well. 
 
 The dinner and evening that followed have been 
 already described. Sir George in his hurry to get 
 away before the first entrance of the Visitors, had 
 not perceived that Lady Fauconberg had retained 
 possession of the Spanish Song, — and he was after- 
 wards both distressed and angry with her when he 
 discovered the purpose for which she had purloined it. 
 
 While his worst suspicions of Colonel Algernon 
 were painfully confirmed by the result of the trial to 
 which he had been subjected ; he felt that he should 
 now find less difficulty in opening his meditated train 
 of enquiries, since such strange conduct as Henry's 
 naturally called for explanation.

 When the Ladies retired at night, the two Gen- 
 tlemen seemed to feel a mutual awkwardness which 
 kept them silent for some moments. 
 
 The Baronet was the first who spoke. " Colonel 
 Algernon," said he, " Considering the relative posi- 
 tion in which we have baen placed, all idea of cere- 
 mony between us has long been at an end. It will 
 be extremely painful to me if I distress you, but it is 
 absolutely necessary I should have some serious con- 
 versation with you, and that I should express myself 
 very plainly. — Before I enter upon any other topic, 
 however, T think it right to observe that as you must 
 be aware of my having noticed how dreadfully you 
 were overcome by Adelaide's last Song ; it was with- 
 out my connivance, and contrary to my permission 
 that you happened to hear her sing it." 
 
 Henry's lip quivered, and his face grew a degree 
 paler than it had been before, as he replied with 
 some hesitation, 
 
 " Sir George, it will be a great relief to my mind 
 if you will have the kindness to tell me by what 
 means that Manuscript Song found its way into your 
 possession ?"

 " Before I clear up that mystery," answered Sir 
 George, looking steadily in his Companion's face, 
 '' I have some important questions to ask you, and 
 I must request you upon the honour of a Gentleman, 
 to answer them clearly and without evasion." 
 
 " That I will readily promise to do, whatever they 
 may be ;" said Colonel Algernon firmly, " provided 
 they concern myself alone, and do not implicate the 
 reputation, or oblige me to betray the secrets of 
 others." 
 
 " You need not apprehend my requiring any thing 
 base or unworthy, of you," observed the Baronet 
 scornfully. — " Perhaps you ma}^ be able to guess 
 the subject of my curiosity." 
 
 '' I believe I can," replied Henry, " I am not at all 
 surprised at your desire to investigate circumstances 
 that in any shape must appear very extraordinary, — 
 that may too have been strangely misrepresented ; but I 
 own I am perfectly astonished at your having become 
 acquainted with what I had hitherto imagined un- 
 known to every person now in England, but myself." 
 " There are certain things," said Sir George, 
 '' that are not allowed to remain verv lono- undis-

 covered ; — that in spite of all our endeavours to 
 conceal them, will sooner or later surely come out." 
 
 " That is indeed too true !" muttered Colonel Al- 
 gernon, as he drew his hand across his forehead to 
 hide the ang-uish he found it imjDossible to repress. 
 
 A pause ensued, which both parties seemed afraid 
 to inteiTupt. At length Sir George resumed the 
 discourse which had been broken off as if by com- 
 mon consent. 
 
 " After what you have already admitted," con- 
 tinued he, " it is quite needless to ask you if you 
 knew Basilia de Lerma." 
 
 At the sound of that name Henry started. 
 
 " For her misfortune, and for my own," replied 
 he, " I did." 
 
 " She had a number of Admirers, had she not, be- 
 fore she became Mrs. Algernon .^" 
 
 A slight flush passed over Colonel Algernon's jjale 
 features. 
 
 " Yes," said he, " many of her own Countrymen 
 and several of our English Officers were in love with 
 her. She was an uncommonly beautiful, fascinating 
 Creature."

 " And your Cousin," pursued the Baronet, " ap- 
 peared, as I am led to believe, almost as much devo- 
 ted to her after her marriage as he had been before it 
 took place." 
 
 " I had hoped," replied Henry, " that you would 
 have spared me any questions upon those points 
 where Horace was personally concerned. You must 
 be aware how painful, how impossible it is for me to 
 answer them! — / am perhaps the last Person," he 
 added after a few minutes silence, " who can be ex- 
 pected to plead in his excuse ; yet nobody can be so 
 conscious as myself how much he is an Object of pity 
 and commiseration. From the hour of his birth he 
 was ruined by over indulgence, he was never taught 
 to control his unruly passions, and the consequence 
 of giving way to them has proved dreadful ! — I should 
 be worse than vindictive if I refused to pardon the 
 injuries I received fi'om him ; since his innocent 
 Victim exhorted me to do so with her dying breath, 
 after she had herself forgiven him all her wrongs. — 
 That scene is too horrible to think of ! I know that 
 the recollection of it preyed constantly, — (for a time

 at least,) upon Horace's mind, and that his remorse 
 was as deep as it was unavailing." 
 
 Sir George gazed at his Companion with feelings 
 of astonishment and horror. 
 
 " Your defence of your Cousin is at least gene- 
 rous," observed he, " My interrogations are now 
 come to an end, and it must be a great relief to us 
 both when such a discussion as this, is concluded. — 
 To prevent the possibility of any misunderstanding 
 between us, — or of my falling into the least mistake 
 prejudicial to you ; I deem it necessary, however re- 
 pugnant it may be to my wishes to do so ; — to tell 
 you clearly, I assume from your own confession that 
 the unfortunate Spanish Lady fell a sacrifice to her 
 Husband's jealousy, and that she met her untimely 
 and violent fate from his hands." 
 
 " I cannot deny that she did," groaned Colonel 
 Algernon in a suffocated voice, as he threw himself 
 back in his chair and covered his face with both his 
 hands, as if he expected to see the Ghost of the mur- 
 dered Basilia rise up before him. 
 
 Sir George walked up and down the room for some

 time in great agitation. At length he felt the neces- 
 sity of again addressing his miserable and guilty 
 Companion. 
 
 " I am much obliged to you Colonel Algernon," 
 he said, '' for the candid manner in which you have 
 replied to all those questions which my anxiety for 
 my Daughter's happiness rendered it my imperative 
 duty to press upon you. It may prove a satisfaction 
 to you to know that your having spoken thus openly, 
 can never be in any way disadvantageous to Your- 
 self; since I had previously been informed of every 
 circumstance relating to your Spanish Connection, 
 and I only delayed naming to you the steps I pro- 
 230se to take in consequence of the new light that has 
 burst upon me, until I had obtained an avowal of the 
 facts from your own lips. 
 
 " In the first place however I must relieve Your 
 curiosity, by telling you from what source I derived 
 my intelligence. It seems that Basilia de Lerma's 
 Father came to London upon business a short time 
 ago; I received a Packet from him this morning, 
 giving me a minute detail of his Daughter's melan-

 choly history, and also enclosing the Manuscript 
 Song which Adelaide unconsciously attempted to 
 sing to you." 
 
 As he concluded these words, the Baronet drew 
 the Letter from his pocket with the intention of 
 offering to show it to Colonel Algernon, who without 
 appearing to perceive it, exclaimed in an accent of 
 great surprise, 
 
 " Can it be possible that poor old Antonio de 
 Lerma is in England ?" 
 
 " I have reason to believe that he brought his 
 Packet here himself," answered Sir George, " but 
 according to his own statement he is firmly resolved 
 to return immediately to Spain." 
 
 " And has he communicated to you," enquired 
 Henry, " if it is his intention to make a public dis- 
 closure of all the particulars connected with his 
 Daughter's dreadful fate, to the world in general ; 
 or has he only revealed them in confidence, to You 
 and to your Family ? — I must endeavour to see him 
 before his departure and to ascertain his purpose." 
 
 " I imagine," said Sir George very contemptu-

 ously, " that you may set your mind at ease upon 
 that point. Don Antonio de Lerma has informed 
 me that / am the only person to whom he has con- 
 fided the real story of his own injuries and his un- 
 happy Daughter's wrong's ; and you may rest assu- 
 red that from me or mine, no living Creature will 
 ever hear one word that can betray the knowledge 
 of such a secret." 
 
 " I thank you for this kindness," replied Colonel 
 Algernon, " and you must allow me to add that it 
 is not more than I had expected from you." 
 
 Sir George turned away from him with great dis- 
 gust, as he observed, " It is useless now to reproach 
 you for not having sooner disclosed to me the very 
 important circumstances of your former Spanish Con- 
 nection. Had you been as open and confiding in 
 the earlier period of our acquaintance, as I have 
 found you to-night, — you would have spared us all 
 much present and future pain. — Your views upon 
 every subject may probably be widely different from 
 those I take, but according to my old fashioned ideas 
 of right and wrong, your conduct has been such as

 oblig'es me to announce to you that I must pe- 
 remptorily withdraw my consent to your intended 
 marriage with my Daughter. — ^It will be my painful 
 task, or that of her Mother, to break as gently as pos- 
 sible to Adelaide, a decision which will shock and 
 afflict her deeply. Her fortitude and strength of 
 mind, will I have no doubt enable her to bear the 
 trial that awaits her, and also in time to regain her 
 natural composure and cheerfulness. You will not 
 of course attempt to see her again ; a parting inter- 
 view could only give her unnecessary distress, and 
 add greater poignancy to those feelings of regret 
 which I fear will prove sufficiently bitter without such 
 excitement. To yourself too, a Meeting under your 
 present circumstances, would merely occasion more 
 aggravated giief, mortification and disappointment." 
 
 Colonel Algernon who had appeared almost stupi- 
 fied while Sir George continued speaking, roused 
 himself as soon as he paused, — and exclaimed with 
 great emotion, 
 
 " Do you intend to s])urn me from your door, like a 
 Malefactor at an instant's warning, after having long

 cherished me under your roof and introduced me to 
 your Friends as the future Husband of Miss Faucon- 
 berg ? — Am I not even to be allowed the poor con- 
 solation of endeavouring- to vindicate my conduct in 
 Her opinion, before I bid her farewell for ever ? — Sir 
 George I do not pretend to assert that you may not 
 with justice consider me deserving of great blame, 
 but I feel I have not merited such treatment as this." 
 
 " Beware how you push me too far, — how you ex- 
 asperate me beyond all patience 1" — replied the Ba- 
 ronet sternly. 
 
 " When I consented to accept you as my future 
 Son-in-Law, I believed you worthy of being entrusted 
 with the happiness of my Child. I have now found 
 reason to think otherwise ; I am therefore perfectly 
 justified in retracting my agreement to an engage- 
 ment I entered into under a mistaken impression of 
 the character of one of the parties principally con- 
 cerned. I have no doubt that any person who was 
 acquainted with the facts, and who considered the 
 case impartially, would be of opinion that I could not 
 act difTerently. — I am very far from wishing to deal

 harshly by you, or of intending to relate your melan- 
 choly history to Adelaide without softening its horrors, 
 and representing- in the strongest light every possible 
 extenuation of your conduct. At the same time I 
 must repeat that my determination to put an imme- 
 diate and final conclusion to all intercourse between 
 yourself and all the Members of my Family, — is ine- 
 vocable." 
 
 " I am not inclined," said Henry, with an air of 
 real or assumed pride, " to demean myself by re- 
 questing you to revoke the bitter sentence you have 
 been pleased to pronounce against me ; though I am 
 conscious that it must completely destroy all my 
 hopes of happiness, and blight every prospect of my 
 future life. — From no other person than the Father 
 of Miss Fauconberg, would I have borne to hear the 
 injurious construction that has been put upon my ac- 
 tions and motives, or submitted to the severity with 
 which my wounded feelings have been disregarded. 
 For Her sake alone I have patiently endured re- 
 proaches which have made my blood boil indignantly 
 in my veins. But that Ordeal is now over. I shall

 leave this place to-morrow morning with the earliest 
 dawn, and I do not wish to depart for the last time 
 from Fauconherg Manor with sentiments of ill-will or 
 resentment towards any of its Inhabitants." 
 
 Sir George scarcely knew whether to be softened 
 by Colonel Algernon's appeal, or indignant at the 
 assm-ance that emboldened him to make it. After 
 a moment's consideration, he observed, 
 
 " If I have said any thing" that has hurt or offend- 
 ed you, it was unintentionally, and I much regret 
 my having done so. — T should be extremely sorry if 
 we did not part in charity with each other." 
 
 And he held out his hand to Henry who pressed it 
 convulsively, but seemed too much agitated by con- 
 tending emotions to be able to speak. 
 
 As he was leaving the room, the Baronet, as if sud- 
 denly recollecting himself; called him back again to 
 tell him, ' he should inform his Guests when he met 
 them at breakfast the next morning, that Colonel Al- 
 gernon had been unexpectedly summoned to Town 
 by pressing business of great importance to his Fa- 
 mily. That it would probably detain him some

 time, and must at least delay his intended marriag-e, 
 if it did not ultimately prove an obstacle to prevent 
 its taking place altogether.' ' Such an announce- 
 ment,' he added, ' would form a perfect excuse for 
 his hurried departure, and would also account for 
 Adelaide's consequent distress of mind. It would be 
 a means too of preparing all their Friends to learn 
 hereafter without much surprise, that an Engage- 
 ment thus rendered uncertain, had been broken off 
 entirely by the mutual consent of the Parties.' 
 
 Colonel Algernon hastily thanked Sir George for 
 his kind consideration, and retired to his own apart- 
 ment in a state bordering upon distraction.

 gone very early to her Daughter's Room with the

 at discovering that she was already dressed and gone 
 down stairs. She immediately proceeded to her Bou- 
 doir, and when she found her in the pitiable state of 
 grief and stupor already described, she very naturally 
 imagined that in defiance of Sir George's prohibition, 
 Henry had contrived to persuade her to listen to his 
 own version of his Story, and had obtained an inter- 
 view with her before he left the House. Under this 
 impression her Ladyship enquired,

 " If she had not seen Colonel Algernon that morn- 
 hig?" 
 
 " No," replied Adelaide, in a mournful voice. 
 Then giving her jSJother the paper she still held in 
 her hand, and speaking slowly and with effort, — she 
 continued, "And if I am to judge from this Letter, I 
 am never likely to see him again." 
 
 " Oh Mama!" she added, when Lady Fauconberg 
 had finished reading the incomprehensible Manuscript, 
 " I am sure Vou know the meaning of all this. You 
 must be acquainted with Henry's dreadful secret." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's feelings did not often overcome 
 her, but there was something so affecting in poor 
 Adelaide's voice and manner, that she was for several 
 minutes quite unable to give her any answer, or even 
 to decide how much it might be judicious to tell her 
 during her present agony of mind. 
 
 " Your Father," she at length observed, " is much 
 more capable than I am, of explaining all that you 
 desire to understand ; I will therefore go immediately 
 and fetch him." 
 
 Though Sir George had been prepared to find his

 Daughter looking an image of woe, he was extremely 
 shocked when he saw her. He sat down beside her, 
 and affectionately taking her hand, 
 
 " My dear Child," said he, " I am aware that you 
 are not now to learn for the first time, that we live in 
 a world of disappointment and soitow. Young as 
 you are, you have already experienced your share of 
 anxieties and crosses ; and if your present grief is a 
 more sevei-e one than any you have hitherto been 
 called upon to endure, — ^I trust that you will not 
 allow your fortitude to desert you, and that you will 
 be supported under it by that religious strength which 
 can alone enable us to bear such trials." 
 
 " I will endeavour to be resigned," replied Ade- 
 laide, meekly, " to submit patiently to whatever may 
 await me. — I fear," continued she, " yet I should like 
 to know the worst. — ^You need have no apprehension

 thing, for I assure you I cannot possibly hear any

 tempt to soothe or comfort her until her curiosity had 
 been gratified ; he therefore began to relate with much 
 caution and delicacy the principal circumstances of 
 Basilia de Lerma's history, — touchiDg- slightly upon 
 those points he thought most likely to distress her, 
 and dwelling chiefly upon the general details. 
 
 Adelaide listened with silent hut earnest attention. 
 — When her Father mentioned the fact of Henry's 
 man'iage, she became so violently agitated that he 
 was obliged to suspend his narration ; and it was 
 some time before she could gain sufficient composure 
 to request him to proceed, or to enable her to under- 
 stand the sequel. 
 
 He expatiated largely upon Horace Algernon's 
 cruel and unprincipled conduct, lamented the fatal 
 effect it had produced upon Henry's mind, and the 
 consequent destruction of his own and Basilia's hap- 
 piness; — And contriving to omit entirely all the hor- 
 rors that had attended her fate, — he described her 
 as having died of a broken heart occasioned by the 
 unfounded jealousy of her Husband. 
 
 Adelaide looked up in Sir George's face when he

 ceased speaking, with an air of vacant incredulity, 
 which seemed to imply that she had either not exact- 
 ly comprehended, or did not quite believe the con- 
 cluding part of his detail. At length an expression of 
 wild intelligence flashed suddenly across her features. 
 
 " I see it all now," she exclaimed ; " You have 
 kindly endeavoured to draw a veil over the truth, but 
 it cannot remain concealed from my discovery. — 
 Basilia de Lerma did not die a natural death. I sus- 
 pect, — I know, — that — ^lie murdered her !" 
 
 These last words were uttered distinctly, but in a 
 low hollow tone, — almost a whisper. Adelaide had 
 continued gazing at her Father, but her eyes were 
 now fixed upon his countenance with such intense 
 eagerness, that it appeared as if her very life de- 
 pended upon his confirmation or denial of her asserted 
 conjecture. His silence completely extinguished every 
 glimmering of hope, her brain grew dizzy under the 
 weight of horror that oppressed her, a piercing shriek 
 burst from her lips, and she fell back into Sir George's 
 arms in strong hysterics. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg, terrified out of her senses, rush-

 ed towards the door to call for assistance ; but her 
 Husband, distressed and alarmed as he was himself, 
 had the presence of mind to detain her and attempt 
 to quiet her apprehensions. He assured her ' that 
 the violence of their poor Child's attack would proba- 
 bly shorten its duration, — that until it beg-an to abate, 
 nothing they could do for her would afford her any 
 relief, — ^but that he trusted she would afterwards be 
 the better for having given vent to her feelings in 
 that way.' And he added, ' that peculiarly circum- 
 stanced as she was, it was very desirable that her 
 Parents should be the only Spectators of her suf- 
 ferings.' 
 
 Sir George's predictions were verified, for although 
 Adelaide's afflicting acces lasted much longer than 
 he had anticipated, her agitation at length subsided 
 by slow degrees, and she became restored to a state 
 of comparative composure and recollection. Still 
 from time to time she had slight returns of hyste- 
 rical affection whenever the horrors of Basilia's fate 
 recurred more vividly to her imagination. Lady 
 Fauconberg perceived the necessity of keeping her

 perfectly quiet ; and as she appeared exti emely weak 
 and exhausted, she suggested the expediency of her 
 going to her own room, and lying down for a few 
 hours, — observing ' that as she had had very little 
 rest during the night, she might perhaps fall asleep.' 
 
 Adelaide shook her head mournfully ; she did not 
 attempt to speak, but she rose immediately, and sup- 
 ported by her Mother she walked up stairs. Lady 
 Fauconberg rang for her Maid, — and having remark- 
 ed ' that Miss Fauconberg was not well,' desired 
 her to assist in undressing her. She then ordered 
 her to close the shutters, and seating herself by the 
 bed side, she dismissed her astonished Attendant. 
 
 Adelaide meanwhile had remained entirely pas- 
 sive, and she seemed to take no notice of any thing 
 around her until she was roused by the sound of the 
 Breakfast Bell; starting as if from a dream, she 
 drew aside the curtain, and after endeavouring to 
 collect her ideas, she enquired ' if Mrs. Sutton and 
 Miss Drake were not staying at Fauconberg?' 
 
 On being answered in the affirmative, she said, 
 " Then you will go down Stairs now Mama, will you 
 not ?"

 ADELAIDE. 113 
 
 " No, my dear," replied Lady Fauconberg, " they 
 will I am sure excuse my absence when they hear 
 that you are ill." 
 
 " I am not ill," continued Adelaide, raising herself 
 in her bed, " I have only been distressed and over- 
 come just now, — but I must get the better of that; 
 and if I cannot at first completely subdue my feel- 
 ings, I will at least conti'ive to conceal them. — Our 
 Visitors will form all sorts of strange conjectures if 
 they do not see you at breakfast ! — ^There is no say- 
 ing what they may suspect! — I should be much 
 easier if you would go and join them. You need not 
 be afraid of leaving me, indeed you need not ; but if 
 you have any objection to my being alone, Maria 
 can bring her work into this Room. She will think 
 I am asleep." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg saw that agitated as her Daugh- 
 ter's nerves had been, any opposition to her wishes 
 would cause an excitement which might prove ex- 
 tremely bad for her. She was also aware of the 
 necessity of keeping her Guests as much in igno- 
 rance as possible of all that had transpired; she

 therefore told Adelaide that she would immediately 
 comply with her desire, — and having summoned her 
 Maid to remain in the room during her absence, she 
 went down stairs to seek Sir George. 
 
 When the Baronet and his Lady entered the Break- 
 fast Room, they found Mrs. Sutton and Miss Drake 
 sitting in deep divan, talking over the probable and 
 improbable reasons of so extraordinary a circum- 
 stance as the non-appearance of any of the Faucon- 
 berg Family at so late an hour, — and trying to re- 
 concile and connect their absence with certain vague 
 rumours Mrs. Sutton had heard from her Maid during 
 her toilette. The two Ladies were far from being 
 satisfied with the explanation given them by their 
 Host and Hostess of Colonel Algernon's sudden de- 
 parture and Adelaide's equally sudden indisposition. 
 They plainly saw that there was something much 
 more seriously wrong and unpleasant in all this, than 
 their Friends chose to confess ; they had little doubt 
 that the Marriage had been entirely broken off; and 
 their curiosity to discover the real truth of the Story, 
 was unbounded.

 Wlien the breakfast was concluded. Lady Faucon- 
 berg told her Visitors that if they liked to take a 
 drive, the Carriage was very much at their service, 
 but she was afraid she should not be able to accom- 
 pany them, as she should feel uncomfortable at leaving 
 Adelaide. 
 
 Mrs. Sutton thanked her, declared she should be 
 miserable if she thought of doing such a thing upon 
 Aer account, but accepted the oifer of the Carriage, as 
 she said that ' She and her Sister very much wished 
 to go and call upon their good Friends at Greyfield.' 
 
 Lady Fauconberg would willingly have proposed 
 any other drive, as she well knew that JNIrs. Sutton's 
 chief object in wishing to see the Shirleys arose from 
 her desire to be the first person to inform them that 
 something extraordinary had happened at Faucon- 
 berg, and also to induce them to assist her in making 
 out what it could possibly be ? 
 
 ' They must hear of Adelaide's disappointment 
 sooner or later,' thought her liadyship, ' so it does 
 not much signify ; — but I should have preferred 
 breaking it to them myself and in my own way. It

 is out of the question for me to attempt to make any 
 objection to the visit, I must therefore console mj^self 
 by being left at liberty during the rest of the morning, 
 and surely it will be no little comfort to be relieved 
 from the presence of such inquisitive Observers.' 
 
 Having arrived at this philosophical conclusion, 
 Lady Fauconberg rang the bell and ordered the Car- 
 riage for her Guests. 
 
 Adelaide had regained much more self-possession 
 before her Mother returned to her room ; she re- 
 quested to see her Father, and begged so earnestly 
 that he w^ould repeat to her once again every circum- 
 stance connected with Basilia de Lerma's mamage 
 and death, and also of his last interview with Henry 
 Algernon, — that much as Sir George apprehended 
 his compliance might occasion a recurrence of the 
 agonizing scene he had already witnessed ; he found 
 it impossible to refuse his Daughter a boon she en- 
 treated him with such importunity to grant. He 
 described to her the old Spaniard's Visit, the j3acket 
 he had left, even read to her the Letter it had con- 
 tained, and finally recorded almost every word that 
 had afterwards passed between Henry and himself.

 Poor Adelaide was evidently agitated during this 
 recital, but when it was over she said ' she felt much 
 better satisfied now she had heard it, and was con- 
 vinced that nothing was hid from her.' 
 
 Perhaps too, in Antonio de Lenna*s Narrative, she 
 found excuses for Henry Algernon's conduct, and 
 palliations of his guilt which in some degree miti- 
 gated its horrors ; and by allowing her to consider 
 him less criminal, than misguided and unfortunate, — 
 did not forbid her pitying him and cherishing a favor- 
 able opinion of his general character. — At all events 
 her spirits seemel tranquillized after her conference 
 with her Father, — a weariness and languor gradually 
 succeeded the restless irritability which had previously 
 alarmed Lady Fauconberg ; she remained long silent, 
 and at last sunk into a quiet slumber. 
 
 INIrs. Sutton and her Sister had timed their drive 
 so judiciously that they reached Grey field just at the 
 hour when the whole Shirley Family were assembled 
 at Luncheon. When the two Ladies were announced, 
 ther^' was an expression of importan -e in the counte- 
 nance of the former. Vi\\(\ of mysterv in that of the

 latter, which did not escape the ohservation of their 
 Friends. They had scarcely seated themselves, be- 
 fore Mrs. Sutton remarked, " That as they had only 
 arrived at Fauconberg Manor the preceding day, the 
 Miss Shirleys must doubtless be surprised at seeing 
 them unaccompanied either by their Hostess or by 
 Adelaide." 
 
 Sir William replied, " that such an addition to the 
 party would certainly have been both welcome and 
 agreable, but he was delighted to see his present 
 Visitors, — and his Daughters ought to feel the more 
 obliged to them for having so soon left Lady Faucon- 
 berg to call upon them." 
 
 " We had intended," pursued Mrs. Sutton, " to 
 remain only a very short time at Fauconberg, as we 
 imagined we might have been in the way there, — 
 that our company might have been inconvenient at 
 this peculiar moment; but I am not now quite sure 
 what alteration we may be inclined to make in our 
 plans." 
 
 " Have you been invited to stay till after the 
 Wedding i'" said Julia.

 " No," replied Miss Drake, " Indeed we have not. 
 We may consider ourselves fortunate in having heen 
 even introduced to the Bridegroom, since he set out 
 unexpectedly for London by day-break this morning." 
 
 There was a general exclamation of surprise ! 
 
 Mrs. Sutton shook her head and lowered her voice 
 as she observed, " that she feared all was not exactly 
 right. That she would not for the world hint her 
 suspicions to any living Creature but Sir William and 
 his Family ; She felt sure of their discretion, and was 
 also aware of the great interest they took in every 
 thing relating to the parties concerned." 
 
 " We do indeed," answered Emily warmly. 
 
 " And you must be certain," continued Julia, " that 
 it will make every one of us perfectly miserable if 
 we hear that any misunderstanding has taken place 
 between Colonel Algernon and La Fiancee, which is 
 likely to derange their projected Union." 
 
 She turned her eye towards her Brother as she 
 spoke, but the fierceness of the look with which he 
 met her glance, at once checked her curiosity and 
 prevented her daring to repeat her oftence. Perhaps

 Mr. Shirley did not wish to be subjected to the scru- 
 tiny of Miss Drake's observation, for he rose, and 
 walking- round the table, apparently to listen to Mrs. 
 Sutton's news, he placed himself exactly behind her 
 Sister's chair. 
 
 " Come, my good Ladies," said Sir William, " You 
 keep us too long in suspense. You really must tell 
 us, without further preface or preamble, what has 
 happened to our Friends." 
 
 " That is what we do not exactly know ourselves," 
 replied Mrs. Sutton. " Our own observation enabled 
 us to discover very clearly last night that there had 
 been a very serious quarrel between Adelaide and 
 her Lover, and that her Parents treated him and 
 looked upon him very coldly. — We learnt from Sir 
 George and Lady Fauconberg this morning that the 
 Gentleman was suddenly gone away, and the Young- 
 Lady was too ill, (no doubt in consequence of his 
 departure,) to come down to breakfast. The Ba- 
 ronet hinted something about the Colonel's having 
 been summoned by distressing business, but I think 
 that was merely said as a blind to mislead us from

 the truth ; he also alluded to the possibility of his 
 Daughter's marriage being ultimately broken off; 
 which I shrewdly suspect it has been already. What 
 can have been the cause of this unfortunate rupture 
 we are perfectly at a loss to imagine ? Perhaps You 
 may be better able to guess. — Having mentioned all 
 the facts that have come to our knowledge, J must 
 just add that there are strange rumours and conjec- 
 tures afloat amongst the Servants in the House upon 
 the subject, but of course one cannot entirely give 
 credit to any of these. I heard one or two circum- 
 stances from my Maid which may I believe be relied 
 upon. The Footman who happened to sleep exactly 
 above Colonel Algernon, told her he was sure the 
 Colonel had never been in bed all night, for he heard 
 him talking to himself and pacing up and down his 
 room as if he was distracted. It is certain he went 
 to Miss Fauconberg's Boudoir this morning, so early 
 that the Housemaid had not even opened the shut- 
 ters; and as Adelaide herself immediately joined 
 him there, they must have met by appointment. 
 They had not remained many minutes together, be-

 fore the Colonel threw up the sash and rushed through 
 the window in the direction of the Stables. A Man 
 who was mowing the grass upon the Lawn, declared 
 he never saw any body look and run so wildly in his 
 life. He had scarcely turned the angle of the House, 
 when Miss Fauconberg came out after him, as if she 
 wished to call him back. He probably did not hear 
 her voice, at any rate he did not obey the summons. 
 She stood waiting and watching for him some time, 
 and then returned with a melancholy and despairing 
 look to her Boudoir. — The parting scene though so 
 short, must have been dreadfully affecting, for even 
 after Sir George and Lady Fauconberg went down 
 to comfort Adelaide, it was a great while before they 
 could succeed in restoring her to any thing like com- 
 posure ; her hysterical screams were distinctly heard 
 by more persons than one." 
 
 " Poor thing," ejaculated Emily almost unconsci- 
 ously. FiVen Julia looked concerned. And Mr. 
 Shirley turned away his head as if he was unwilling 
 that any body should witness the contending emo- 
 tions that might be visible in his countenance.

 " It is too clear," remarked Sir William, " that 
 some unforeseen and fatal circumstance has for the 
 present deranged the happy prospects of our Friends, 
 and I am sincerely sorry for it. The details we 
 learn from Servants are generally exaggerated ; and 
 dark as the case appears at present, in every sense of 
 the word, — I am not quite without hopes that all may 
 be finally set to rights again, and that this passing 
 cloud may be entirely forgotten, — You may depend 
 upon it we will never mention or allude in any way 
 to what you have just told us, until we hear more 
 about it from the Fauconberg Family themselves, 
 and have their authority to do so." 
 
 Mrs. Sutton thanked Sir William for this promise, 
 while she could not help feeling that it conveyed a 
 sort of reproof. She returned from her visit rather 
 mortified at not having been able to extract any in- 
 formation from the Shirleys, and less elated than she 
 usually was when she was conscious of having been 
 the very first person to connnunicate an extraordi- 
 nary and interesting piece of intelligence. 
 
 Adelaide did not come down stairs that day, hut

 she appeared at breakfast the following morning. 
 She was extremely pale, and there was a settled and 
 unnatural calmness in her voice and manner, — far 
 more shocking than any outward expressions of grief 
 or agitation could have been. She seemed to speak 
 and act mechanically : and she glided about from one 
 place to another rather like a spectre, than a living 
 Person who still retained an interest in the concerns 
 of this world. 
 
 In short, after the first violent burst of anguish had 
 subsided, her spirit appeared to have been broken, 
 and her feelings paralised by the shock she had re- 
 ceived, — No complaint, no murmur of sorrow or 
 regret ever passed her lips. She endeavoured to re- 
 sume all her usual occupations. She did not attempt 
 to seclude herself more than she had formerly done, 
 or make the slightest objection to going out and 
 mixing in general society ; — bat every thing was be- 
 come perfectly indifferent to her, no amusement 
 afforded her any i^leasure, and it was impossible to 
 lead her to take an interest in any of the events that 
 were passing around her.

 Sir George and Lady Fauconbevg became seriously 
 alarmed, they feared that the gloom which had spread 
 itself over their Daughter's character, would at length 
 undermine her health. Sir George was the more 
 miserable about her, because he reproached himself 
 for having been instrumental in promoting their first 
 intimacy with Colonel Algernon. 
 
 " Had I attended to your timely warnings," he 
 often said to Lady Fauconberg, " all this mischief 
 would have been averted." 
 
 Though they were well aware of the inefRcacy 
 of medical skill in " ministering to a mind dis- 
 eased/' the unhappy Couple determined to confide 
 their anxiety to a Physician of eminence in the 
 neighbourhood, who had lono^ attended their Fa- 
 mily ; and to ask him if he could suggest any means 
 of rousing Adelaide, from the melancholy state of 
 apathy into which she had fallen. 
 
 They found they had applied to a judicious as well 
 as a kind and considerate Counsellor ; and his opinion 
 gave them much hope and comfort. He told them 
 ' they must recollect that a first sorrow is always a

 peculiarly bitter one, — that Miss Fauconberg was just 
 of an age to feel most acutely the pangs of disap- 
 pointed affection, — ^but that deep and lasting as they 
 might prove, time and absence would infallibly blunt 
 their edge. And that he had little doubt a young mind 
 like hers — supported too by religious principle, — 
 would sooner or later throw off the weight that now 
 so heavily depressed it ; and regain its natural tone.' 
 He advised them not to appear to notice her dejec- 
 tion, or to hurry her into scenes of gaiety, while she 
 was unable to enjoy them ; but to try to amuse her 
 thoughts, and to furnish them with quiet and constant 
 subjects of occupation. 
 
 When Henry Algernon left Fauconberg Manor, 
 he scarcely knew where he was going or in what 
 direction to turn his steps. He had told his Servant 
 over night, to order his Horses to be saddled very 
 early, and he had hastily desired him in the morn- 
 ing, to pack up all his things and to follow him im- 
 mediately to Oldthorpe. Thither, as soon as he had 
 torn himself from Adelaide's Boudoir, he rode him- 
 self, at a pace which seemed as if he imagined that

 his hoi-se's speed might carry him away from his own 
 reflections; but alas! they were bitter Companions 
 from whom it was impossible to escape ! 
 
 When he entered the little Borough Town, the 
 scene of his former Rival's political triumph; he 
 moderated his gallop to a canter, and proceeding to 
 the principal Inn, enquired if the London Mail had 
 yet passed ? 
 
 The Waiter stared, and looking first at the Rider 
 whose question betrayed such astonishing ignorance 
 of the usages of the place, — and then at bis hot and 
 panting Steed, — ^replied, — " No, Colonel Algernon, 
 the London Mail never comes through Oldthorpe be- 
 fore nine o'clock." 
 
 " Desire the Hostler to come and take my Horse," 
 said the Colonel, " and whenever the Coach arrives, 
 you will have the goodness to let me know ; I intend 
 to go to Town in it if it is not full. — My Servant will 
 be here presently, and I shall have some directions to 
 give him." 
 
 " Will you please to have breakfast. Sir ?" con- 
 tinued the persevering Waiter.

 " No," answered Henry, sternl}', " I do not want 
 any. You may leave me." 
 
 And the dismayed and wonder-stricken Attendant, 
 lost no time in obeying the discom'teous hint. 
 
 Fortunately there were two vacant places in the 
 Mail, and in the course of a certain number of hours, 
 Colonel Algernon found himself once more in London. 
 
 He remained there only long enough to put in pro- 
 gress some professional arrangements respecting his 
 future military plans, and then proceeded to Alta- 
 mont Castle. 
 
 He found great difficulty in composing such an 
 account of his rejection at Fauconberg, as might 
 appear at all credible or satisfactory to his Grand- 
 father. The poor old Peer was deeply grieved at 
 his disappointment, and furiously angry with all the 
 Fauconberg Family. 
 
 " I see," said he, " that you have not told me the 
 whole truth, but it is plain that they have every one 
 of them treated you shamefully ; and I think you 
 have made a good escape in not marrying a Girl who 
 could be heartless enough to give you up for no rea-

 Do not attempt to excuse her, for I will not listen to 
 you," 
 
 Lord Altamont made no opposition to a project of 
 military exchange which Henry had formed in con- 
 sequence of the sad alteration that had taken place in 
 all his other prospects : — ^But merely observed, when 
 his Grandson had mentioned it to him, " that he 
 should be extremely sorry to part with him, but he 
 hoped a short absence might prove beneficial to him. 
 — I have been accustomed," added he, " in one way 
 or another to meet with personal mortification in all 
 those I have loved best ; and in some instances I have 
 deserved it." 
 
 A short time after this. Sir George Fauconberg 
 saw in the Gazette, that Colonel Henry Algernon 
 had left the Guards, and been appointed to the com- 
 mand of a Regiment under Orders for the West- 
 Indies ; and about a week later, he learnt from the 
 same source, that he had joined his new Corps, — and 
 that they had embarked for their destination. This

 intelligence gave both him and Lady Fauconberg 
 much satisfaction, since it relieved them from any ap- 
 prehension of Adelaide's accidentally meeting Henry 
 in Society. Adelaide herself received the news of 
 his departure without much visible emotion, but her 
 Father and Mother remarked that she looked sadder 
 and paler than usual for some days after she heard it. 
 As the Baronet and his Lady were aware that 
 rumours of the fact must be pretty generally dissemi- 
 nated, they did not long delay communicating to their 
 Friends, "that circumstances had occurred which seem- 
 ed likely to interfere so materially with the future hap- 
 piness of their Daughter and Colonel Algernon, that 
 they had all judged it most expedient that the intended 
 Union should be entirely set aside. — Neither of the Par- 
 ties," they said "were at liberty to mention the reasons 
 that had caused their separation, — they could only 
 assert that they had parted with feelings of mutual 
 esteem and regret." 
 
 For at least nine days this mysterious affair fur- 
 nished a subject of wonder and conversation, to all ■ 
 the worthy Neighbours within twenty miles of Fau-

 conberg Manor. Nothing was thought of but 
 Adelaide's marriage, and the public curiosity was 
 actively exerted to discover why it was not to take 
 place, after all the preliminaries had to appearance 
 been so satisfactorily and agreably settled. 
 
 The secret cause of Henry's departure, was how- 
 ever an Enigma which it was impossible for any 
 person truly to explain ; but every body formed a 
 solution of their own, and all and each maintained 
 that their particular version of the Story, was the 
 real and correct one. In this way the most impro- 
 bable Tales were circulated and believed, until some 
 new marvel supplanted Miss Fauconberg's concerns 
 in the public attention. 
 
 Adelaide's Friends at Greyfield felt no common 
 degree of curiosity to ascertain what could have been 
 the incomprehensible impediment which had started 
 up to form the Barrier that had prevented her fulfil- 
 ling her Engagement with Colonel Algernon. But 
 they puzzled themselves in vain ; for although every 
 Member of the Family, from different motives, was 
 anxious to be able to unravel the mystery, — nothing

 very satisfactory could be elucidated ; — and they only 
 differed from their Neighbours, in continuing to in- 
 terest themselves as warmly as ever in the case, 
 long after almost every body else had ceased to 
 think about it. 
 
 The Miss Shirley s had of course returned the visit 
 they had received from the Guests at Fauconberg; 
 and Emily had subsequently been invited to stay 
 there, as Lady Fauconberg judiciously thought that 
 the society of such a Friend would prove of much 
 service to her Daughter. It did indeed seem to give 
 Adelaide pleasure to have her with her, — but when 
 Emily, presuming upon the privilege afforded her 
 by her affection, ventured one day to touch deli- 
 cately upon the cause of her Friend's distress, — and 
 with tender sympathy endeavoured to point out those 
 sources which had given comfort and consolation to 
 herself under somewhat similar circumstances ; — 
 Adelaide cut short all future attempts of this kind, 
 by replying : —

 tention dearest Emily, and feel very grateful to you

 explain it to you; and you must not consider me 
 ungracious if I request you never to allude to this 
 melancholy subject again, for indeed it distresses — 
 it kills me to talk upon it, — even to You /" 
 
 Miss Shirley spent much of her time at Fauconberg. 
 She went there as often as her Father could spare her, 
 and had the pleasure of observing that her visits were 
 always beneficial in cheering and anmsing Adelaide's 
 mind. 
 
 Julia occasionally accompanied her, — she consi- 
 dered it a sort of duty, but she shrunk internally at 
 the idea of it, — for it really distressed her to witness 
 the sad alteration that had taken place in the spirits 
 of all the Fauconberg Family. — " She hated to see 
 them," she said, "• for she could do them no good. 
 She did not know how to comfort them as Emily

 could." — She felt too a sort of restraint in their pre- 
 sence ; she thought it decorous to be jDarticularly 
 well behaved, — and she looked upon the days she 
 passed with them as a penance from which she was 
 unspeakably rejoiced to be relieved. 
 
 Sir William Shirley very often turned his Horse's 
 head in the direction of Fauconberg ; but either from 
 a feeling of delicacy or of pride, his Son did not even 
 once attempt to call there during the whole time he 
 remained at Greyfield. 
 
 As the Spring advanced, Sir George and Lady 
 Fauconberg considered how little it would be in 
 unison with the present state of their Daughter's 
 feelings to enter into the gaieties of a London Sea- 
 son. She had never been Abroad, and as they thought 
 a short Tour upon the Continent might interest and 
 amuse her in a quiet way, they determined to travel 
 up the Rhine, and spend the Summer Months in 
 Switzerland. 
 
 Adelaide appeared much pleased with the idea of 
 this plan, and to render it more completely agreable 
 to her, her Mother proposed to endeavour to persuade

 ADELAIDE. 135 
 
 Sir "William Shirley to allow Emily to accompany 
 tliem in this excursion. The Baronet at first objected 
 violently to the proposal of parting with his favorite 
 Child for so long a period, — " It would be too great 
 a sacrifice," he said ; — But Lady Fauconberg adroitly 
 hinted that a foreign Tour might possibly prove ra- 
 ther beneficial to dear Emily, by helping to wear 
 away certain impressions which she feared had been 
 but too deeply stamped upon her mind. And she 
 added, that as he would probably be in London 
 during the greater portion of her absence, he would 
 not miss her society near so much there as at Grey- 
 field. In short she contrived to obtain Sir William's 
 consent to the project she had formed. 
 
 Emily herself was delighted to accompany her 
 Friends Abroad, and to have an opportunity of visi- 
 ting Countries she had long wished to see. Such a 
 journey was in every way congenial to her feehngs, 
 for although she scarcely dared confess it to herself, 
 she had almost as great a disinclination to being car- 
 ried to a succession of miinteresting Balls and Parties, 
 as Adelaide could have.

 The Tour proved in all respects prosperous and 
 agreable, and both the Young Ladies enjoyed it even 
 more than Sir George and Lady Fauconberg had 
 expected them to do. 
 
 Adelaide's admiration of the beauties of Nature 
 was often and strongly called forth by the loveliness 
 and grandeur of the scenery around her, and upon 
 these occasions she expressed it as warmly as she 
 would formerly have done. But frequently a bold or 
 magnificent Landscape recalled to her recollection 
 one of Henry's vivid descriptions, — and she never 
 gazed at any thing she thought particularly beauti- 
 ful, without secretly feeling how much more she 
 should have admired every object had he been pre- 
 sent to admire it with her. The consciousness that 
 Emily understood, and in some degree shared her 
 feelings, rendered her a peculiarly welcome Compa- 
 nion to Adelaide ; and this circumstance, though never 
 alluded to by either, endeared them much to each other. 
 
 Adelaide's Spirit had been completely crushed by 
 ihe severity of the blow that had fallen upon her, 
 but instead of allowing herself to indulge unavailing

 ADELAIDE. 137 
 
 sorrow, she had from the first moment made every 
 effort to subdue it. Her slrong" sense of Religion 
 told her that it was her duty to submit patiently to 
 any trial that might be sent her ; and that although 
 she had been disappointed in the object of her warm- 
 est affections, she had abundant reason to be thankful 
 for the numerous blessings she still possessed. And 
 when she compared even her present lot with that of 
 others, she confessed to herself that she ought to con- 
 sider it a favoured and a happy one. Her gratitude 
 to her kind and indulgent Parents, was unbounded, 
 and it was her ardent desire to conceal from them how 
 much she internally suffered, — that enabled her to 
 assume the calmness and composure of manner al- 
 ready described. It was the same feeling which made 
 her attempt to enjoy every thing she knew they had 
 devised to amuse her ; and if she was not able always 
 entirely to succeed, the very effort of trying to do so, 
 was of service to her. 
 
 By degrees she began to look with less indifference 
 upon the objects around her; the elasticity of youth 
 seemed inclined to exert its power in giving a new

 spring to her feelings : — Variety and change of scene 
 had diverted her thoughts into a fresh channel, and 
 although the chill of bhghted hopes still clung secretly 
 and heavily round her heart ; she had, when she re- 
 turned to England, regained not only a look of health, 
 hut also some portion of her natural cheerfulness.

 Mr. Shirley was impatient to take his Seat in the 
 House of Commons, that he might astonish the world 
 with the brilliancy of his eloquence. He spoke fre- 
 quently, and at first with every advantage and flat- 
 tering circumstance of encouragement that could be 
 accorded to a Young Man whose talents were consi- 
 dered so promising. But though he expressed him- 
 self with great fluency, his language was elegant, 
 and his allusions often happily introduced ; — his 
 reasoning was too superficial to carry any weight, 
 and his arguments were visionary and fallacious, 
 rather than sound and convincing.

 He addressed himself more to the imagination than 
 the judgment of his hearers, — and hoped to acquire 
 consequence with those of his own way of thinking, 
 by pkmging violently into Party Politics. This was 
 a great mistake, for while it disgusted his Adversaries 
 it failed to conciliate the admiration of his Friends, 
 who perceived that he was inclined to go too far upon 
 all subjects to be likely to become a useful or credita- 
 ble Auxiliary. — In short, his Oratory was much less 
 admired in St. Stephen's, than it had been at Old- 
 thorpe ; and it was universally acknowledged that he 
 had disappointed the sanguine expectations that had 
 been formed of him. 
 
 William could not help feeling a little mortified at 
 perceiving that his Speeches were not more appre- 
 ciated, but his vanity partly concealed from him the ' 
 truth, and led him to beUeve that it was a sentiment 
 of jealousy towards a rising Orator, which prevented 
 others from according him his due share of praise and 
 approbation. 
 
 He was much surprised, when he was leaving the 
 House one night after a very long Debate, by meeting

 Arthur Vernon at the door. After the first greetings 
 were over, his Cousin told him that he had come up 
 to Town that afternoon upon business which would 
 probably detain him about a week ; and having learnt 
 that he was likely to take a part in the discussion that 
 was to come on in Parliament at night, he had has- 
 tened down to Westminster, to have the pleasure of 
 hearing him speak. 
 
 William, who felt much gratified by this compli- 
 ment, replied with a smile, " This was indeed very 
 kind of You, and I hope," (he added, after a mo- 
 ment's hesitation,) '^ that yoa have not been altoge- 
 ther disappointed." 
 
 Arthur, who was too honest to flatter any body 
 against his conscience, immediately answered, 
 
 " You know, William, that You and I think diffe- 
 rently upon the subject of the Debate, therefore I 
 trust you will forgive me if I say that you did not 
 convince me by your arguments, — but I assure you I 
 admired your eloquence very much, and rejoice that 
 I have had this opportunity of hstening to it. — But 
 how are my Uncle and your Sisters ? They are in 
 Town of course."

 " They are quite well," said Mr. Shirley, " An< 
 my Father and Julia will be delighted to see you." 
 
 " And Emily " enquired Captain Vernon, in 
 
 a faltering voice. " Why did you only mention 
 JuUa ?" 
 
 " Oh, do you not know," replied William, " that 
 Emily has run away from us ? — You need not look 
 so much alarmed," continued he in a kinder tone, for 
 he perceived his Cousin turn deadly pale, and lean 
 against the wall to support himself, '' She is only i 
 gone abroad for a few months with the Fauconbergs, 
 I thought you had been aware of the circumstance, 4 
 or I should not have mentioned it to you in that S 
 way." 
 
 The intelHgence of Emily's absence gave rise to a 
 thousand conflicting feelings, vague conjectures, and 
 secret hopes in Arthur Vernon's mind. He had in- 1 
 tended to conceal fi'om his Uncle the circumstance of t 
 his being in London, but he now saw no necessity for 1 1 
 doing so ; and he even determined to call upon him 
 the following morning. As he was not quite sure of 
 the sort of reception he might meet with from Sir 
 William, or indeed if he would feel inclined to see

 him at all, — he contrived to present himself at his 
 door at an horn- when he was not likely to find either 
 him or Julia at home. William had told them at 
 breakfast of his meeting with Arthm*, but as he had 
 forgotten to ask him his address, they did not know 
 where he was to be heard of, until they found his 
 Card upon their table when they came in before dinner. 
 In the coui-se of the evening he received the fol- 
 lowing Note from Julia. — 
 
 " Dear Arthur, 
 
 We were extremely sorry to have missed 
 you when you called here to-day. My Father de- 
 sires me to tell you he hopes you will be able to dine 
 here to-morrow ; And / hope you will have the cha- 
 rity to spend as much of your time with us as you can 
 while you remain in Town, for we are all dreadfully 
 dull without dear Emily, who is gone with the Fau- 
 conberg Family to admire the Wonders of Nature 
 and Aii upon the Continent ; to gaze upon " the 
 sublime and beautiful" in Switzerland ! — -You, who 
 know that I never particularly valued my own So-

 ciety, may imagine how much I want you to assist 
 me to entertain my Father, as well as to amuse my- 
 self during my sohtary hours. He takes all my little 
 attempts in that way in very good part, and I believe 
 he compassionates my case; but his time is always 
 very much engaged, and he is obliged to be fre- 
 quently out. As for William, I am not honoured 
 with a great deal of his Company ; his whole atten- 
 tion is turned to Political Concerns, and to the ma- 
 nagement, (or rather mzsmanagement,) of the Affairs 
 of the Nation. And he passes most of his days and 
 nights in the House of Commons, — where entre nous 
 he does not gain himself much credit. — 
 
 I am summoned and must conclude in haste. Be 
 sure to come to-morrow, and en attendant, believe me 
 Your afFectk)nate Cousin, 
 
 Julia Shirley. 
 
 P. S. — Since you are just arrived from the Country, 
 and must consequently be rather rustic in your ideas, 
 it will be but friendly to tell you that it is not at all 
 the fashion in London to recollect or allude to any 
 circumstance that may have happened elsewhere."

 The kind and considerate hint conveyed in this 
 Postscript, relieved Arthur from his greatest embar- 
 rassment, and he wrote immediately to his Cores- 
 pondent to thank her for her welcome Billet, and to 
 accept the invitation it contained. 
 
 He and Sir WiUiam Shirley felt a mutual sort of 
 awkwardness during the first moments of their meet- 
 ing ; — but as they were sincerely rejoiced to see each 
 other again, this very soon wore away, and Arthur 
 experienced great happiness in perceiving that he 
 still retained his Uncle's esteem and good opinion, and 
 that Sir William treated him with all his former cor- 
 diality and affection, — Several other Guests joined 
 the party, the conversation became general and ani- 
 mated, — but as Captain Vernon seated himself by 
 Julia, who presided at the head of her Father's table, 
 he could not help looking round for Emily, and think- 
 ing how strange and uncomfortable it seemed to see 
 any other person fill her place. 
 
 His Cousin guessed what was passing in his mind. 
 " You are grown absent, Arthur," said she, " which 
 is uncivil. Or perhaps," she added in a lower tone, — 
 " you are only wishing that nobody else was absent."

 Arthur's business was not so speedily terminated as 
 he had expected, and he had now no motive to hurry 
 it on. He staid in London above a fortnight, and 
 during that period he dined ahnost every day at his 
 Uncle's ; but in spite of Julia's remonstrances he con- 
 trived to excuse himself from appearing there very 
 often in the morning. 
 
 He could not fail to remark that Sir William care- 
 fully avoided mentioning Emily's name, or even al- 
 luding to her in his presence, — And this silence, 
 though very natural, gave him considerable pain and 
 mortification. — He had not only the prudence to re- 
 frain from talking constantly to his volatile Cousin 
 about her Sister ; he had also the forbearance to 
 decline listening to many of the details which Julia in 
 her heedlessness was eager to relate to him, and which 
 he longed beyond expression to hear. 
 
 From what she did tell him, he was able to gather, 
 however, that Emily's conduct since he left Grey- 
 field, had rendered her more worthy than ever of his 
 admiration and attachment ; — And various little cir- 
 cumstances conspired to strengthen the agreable im- 
 pression conveyed in all Julia's insinuations, that her

 A D E L A I D K . 147 
 
 affection for him, hopeless as it appeared, — had re- 
 mained undiminished by absence. 
 
 He chanced to meet Lord Stanmore one day at his 
 Uncle's Table, and this slight personal acquaintance 
 with the proud Peer, tended considerably to weaken 
 any disinterested regrets he might previously have 
 felt at having been instrumental in preventing the 
 accomplishment of the wish he had formed of beco- 
 ming Emily's Husband. 
 
 Arthur's attention and curiosity were much taken 
 up by the long histories he heard from his Cousin 
 about Adelaide Fauconberg. He pitied her ex- 
 tremely, and perhaps felt more deeply interested for 
 her than he otherwise would have done, from the 
 circumstance of her being Emily's particular Friend. 
 One evening after the conversation had turned upon 
 this favorite topic, Julia observed in her half serious 
 half sarcastic manner, 
 
 " There must be a strange infatuation hi the pas- 
 sion of Love! I am sure that William sometimes 
 imagines he shall be able to persuade this poor bro- 
 ken-hearted Idol of his Affections, to forget Colonel 
 
 Algernon, and consent to become Mrs. Shirley at last."

 " And you think such a revolution in her senti- 
 ments, impossible ?" said Arthur in a tone of thought- 
 ful enquiry. 
 
 " Not absolutely impossible^" re^Dlied his Cousin, 
 " but certainly very improbable. — From any little 
 observation I have been able to make upon matters 
 of this kind, 1 am decidedly of opinion that when a 
 Young" Lady's affections are once seriously engaged^ 
 though adverse circumstances may have separated 
 her from the Object of her choice, it is very unlikely 
 she should ever be prevailed upon to accept another 
 Admirer, — whatever merit he might find in the eyes 
 of her Friends, or possess in his own individual 
 capacity." 
 
 Arthur was silent for a moment or two. '' You 
 reason so admirably upon the tender passion^''^ he 
 then continued with assumed gaiety, '' that it is dif- 
 ficult to believe you have not yourself experienced 
 its influence." 
 
 " No Arthur," answered Julia quickly, " I have 
 seen others suffer so severely from it, that I have 
 always dreaded becoming a Victim in my turn ; and

 have rejoiced, however unsentimental it may sound, 
 — that Nature did not endow Me with a suscepti- 
 ble heart. — Yet years pass on," she added, "and 
 although I am not already old enough to exclaim 
 with the poor Lady in the Song, that " my beauty 
 begins to decay;'' I confess it has now and then 
 occurred to me that it will be expedient in " time 
 to look out for somebody before it is all gone away." 
 
 " I never have yet seen any body whom I could at 
 all fancy as a Husband ; and what is perhaps equally 
 unfortunate, no person has thought of so mad a thing 
 as fancying me for a Wife." 
 
 " That may have been partly your own fault," 
 said her Cousin. " You have perhaps been too 
 scornful. Forgive me dear Julia, if I tell you that 
 you very seldom condescend to do yourself justice. 
 Even / did not discover until very very long after I 
 had known you intimately, the real kindness of your 
 character ; so completely was it concealed under what 
 seemed very opposite appearances." 
 
 " Commendation from You would be too gratify- 
 ing," exclaimed Julia, " if I felt that I deserved it. —

 But it is growing late and I suppose your Coach starts 
 in good time in the morning. I hate to think that 
 you are going to leave us.'' 
 
 And as Arthur stood, apparently unwilling to make 
 the effort of bidding his Relations Adieu, — his heedless 
 Cousin maliciously continued, " what can you he consi- 
 dering about ? You need not take the trouble of framing 
 any pretty little Cousinly messages to Emily, for my 
 Father has expressly forbidden me, (no doubt with 
 the considerate intention of sparing her the regret he 
 knew she would feel at having missed seeing you,) 
 to mention in my Letters to her that you have been 
 in London ; and you know that I dare not venture to 
 disobey his injunctions. — Yet should any opportunity 
 ever occur which might put it in my poor power to 
 befriend you. You might depend upon my doing so to 
 the very utmost of my ability." 
 
 " Dear Emily '." thought Arthur, as he turned 
 away his head to conceal a feeling of vexation he 
 could not repress at hearing of his Uncle's prohibi- 
 tion. " Shall I ever see her again ? And if I do, 
 under what circumstances shall we meet ?"

 When the Fauconberg Family returned from 
 Abroad, their intimacy with their Neighbom-s at 
 Greyfield became of course more closely cemented 
 than ever. The Young Ladies, after having spent 
 so long a period together, were mutually soiTy to 
 part; this regret was most deeply felt by Adelaide, 
 who had no Sister to supply the place of her beloved 
 Companion, and who when she had finished her Tour, 
 did not look forward like Emily to the additional plea- 
 sure of describing what she had seen to the party who 
 were anxiously awaiting her arrival at home. Indeed 
 till after this last separation, Adelaide was not fully

 152 ADELAIDE. 
 
 sensible how necessary to her happiness the society of 
 her Friend had become. Lady Fauconberg felt well 
 aware of this circumstance ; and she had no difficulty 
 in contriving that her Daughter and the Miss Shir- 
 leys should meet very constantly either at her own 
 House or at Greyfield. 
 
 As William Shirley had come down into the Coun- 
 try with his Father, it was not possible for him to at- 
 tempt any longer to shun a Family with whom he 
 was brought into contact almost every day. He 
 therefore took the resolution of affecting to forget the 
 coolness which had existed between himself and the 
 Fauconbergs ; and by imperceptible degrees he soon 
 succeeded in re-estabhshing his former footing of cor- 
 diality and friendship with them. 
 
 His behaviour towards Adelaide was marked by 
 no peculiar attention, and to common Observers it 
 a23peared to resemble that of a Friend or a Brother, 
 certainly not of a Lover ; and in that light she herself 
 regarded it. She consequently felt no restraint in his 
 presence, and she found much satisfaction in talking 
 to him of the Countries she had lately visited, and

 ADELAIDE. 153 
 
 with which he was also well acquainted. It has been 
 already hinted however that his Sister Julia had at a 
 much earlier period been acute enough to discover, or 
 at least to guess the real state of his sentiments. And 
 that She was no Stranger to the hopes he had ven- 
 tured to fonn. 
 
 Nor was she the only person he was now unable to 
 deceive. Lady Fauconberg's quick eye penetrated 
 at once the disguise to which he had subjected his 
 feelings; she saw distinctly that however well he 
 might assume indifference, or whatever part he 
 might chuse to act towards the world, his true yet 
 secret character was still that of Adelaide's devoted 
 Admirer. 
 
 Her Ladyship's resentment against her original 
 Favorite had had ample time to subside, and as all 
 other views for her Daughter's estabhshment were 
 now entirely at an end ; her thoughts insensibly flowed 
 back into their former current, and she began to re- 
 sume with complacency the consideration of those 
 plans which had so anxiously occupied her mind 
 durinp^ many successive years.

 She listened with secret satisfaction to certain over- 
 tures of conciliation which Mr. Shirley at length 
 ventured to address to her; and when he made a 
 more direct appeal to her generosity, and requested 
 her to forgive the folly and ingratitude of his beha- 
 viour towards her, — " Conduct on his part," which 
 he said, " he could never recollect without shame, or 
 think of without the deepest compunction and re- 
 gret :" She easily allowed herself to be propitiated, 
 and declared ' that the frankness and liberality of his 
 present concession, had entirely obliterated all past 
 injuries from her memory.' She went no further 
 how ever. She had found out that his friendship for 
 her was far from being disinterested : she misdoubt- 
 ed the sincerity of his eloquent professions ; and she 
 determined that if it suited her own inclination to 
 favour the advancement of his hopes, — she would 
 oblige him to solicit her good offices in express 
 terms, and only grant him her assistance step by 
 step, after he had condescended to require it. 
 
 She felt that he was in her power, and she took a 
 malicious pleasure in tormenting him by frequently

 beginning to talk of Adelaide, and after leading him 
 on to believe that she was going to communicate 
 something confidential to him upon that most inte- 
 resting subject, — she suddenly started off, and diver- 
 ted the conversation with great ingenuity to any 
 indiflferent topic. Just as a mischievous Boy, will 
 often delight in teasing a Cat, by placing an unfortu- 
 nate Bird or any other alluring Object before her, 
 and then jerking it away again, by pulHng a hidden 
 string ; at the very moment when the eager Animal, 
 supposing it to be within her reach, has stretched out 
 her paw to seize it. 
 
 Mr. Shirley knew Lady Fauconberg's character 
 too well not to understand and despise the feelings 
 that enabled her to derive satisfaction from the exer- 
 cise of this paltry kind of revenge. But he was also 
 aware that her support was essentially necessary to 
 the success of the object he had most at heart; and 
 as his Love was stronger than his Pride, he dissem- 
 bled his indignation, and continued to treat her with 
 the greatest outward deference and attention. — Inter- 
 nally consoling himself with the reflection, ' that ithttle

 156 ADELAIDE. 
 
 signified to him if the Tool he employed was made 
 out of the basest metal, provided it only did the work 
 he required of it.' 
 
 Acting in accordance with this convenient prin- 
 ciple, he soon took an opportunity of sounding the 
 nature of her Ladyship's sentiments towards him, by 
 confessing to her that in spite of all that had pass- 
 ed, his attachment to Adelaide remained as warm 
 as ever it had been; and he even condescended to 
 ask her ' if she thought there was the slightest hope 
 that her Daughter at any distant period might be in- 
 duced to regard him less unfavorably than she had 
 hitherto done ?' 
 
 Lady Fauconberg affected surprise. She shook 
 her head, and put on a look of deep consideration for 
 a minute or two before she replied, " that although 
 Adelaide's engagement with Colonel Algernon could 
 never under any circumstances be possibly renewed ; 
 she felt that at present she ought not, — she could not 
 hold out the least encouragement to induce Mr. Shir- 
 ley to expect that he should succeed in making the 
 faintest impression upon her heart."

## p. 157 (#171) ############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 157 
 
 She was graciously pleased to add, " that as far as 
 her own wishes were concerned, he must be convinced 
 that she should have considered no Alliance more de- 
 sirable for her Daughter than the one he now pro- 
 posed to her; and she believed she might say that 
 Sir George would have fully concurred with her in 
 that feeling. — But after all that Adelaide had suffered 
 lately, they had made a determination never again to 
 attempt in any way to influence her choice, or indeed to 
 desire she should think of man*yiug at all unless she 
 herself expressed an inclination to do so." 
 
 William was not much daunted by a repulse he 
 had partly anticipated, and having once made an 
 opening with Lady Fauconberg, he returned again 
 and again to the charge, until by dint of persecution 
 he prevailed upon her to promise she would endea- 
 vour by every indirect means in her power, to induce 
 her Daughter to look upon his attentions with more 
 complacency, to appreciate his merit, and to reward 
 his constancy. She talked much about the powerful 
 effect of time in smoothing away the deepest impres- 
 sions. Hinted that perseverance, and faithful devo-

 tioii like his, generally tviiiniphed over every difficulty 
 and obstacle that could be opposed to them. And 
 warned him that the only danger he had to appre- 
 hend, was a deficiency of caution or patience on his 
 own part; — Any precipitate advances, would, she 
 assured him, in the present state of Adelaide's mind, 
 ruin his cause even more entirely than they had done^ 
 upon a former occasion. 
 
 Mr. Shirley declared he had suffered too severely 
 in consequence of his first error, to be likely to repeat 
 it. He engaged to be guided wholly by Lady Fau- 
 conberg's counsel ; and asserted that he should never 
 allow himself to despair of success while she continued 
 to give him her kind encouragement and aid. 
 
 However high her Ladyship had held herself in 
 all her conversations with William, her secret atten- 
 tion and anxiety were exclusively directed towards 
 the furtherance of his views. And her thoughts were 
 constantly occupied in trying to devise the best me- 
 thod of promoting and preparing the way for an 
 Alliance she had herself been the first jierson to chalk 
 out for Adelaide, — and which she now desired more

 ardently than ever, should take place at no very remote 
 period. 
 
 As an indispensable preliminary, she ventured to 
 mention the subject with great caution to Sir George, 
 and was agreably surprised by the encouraging re- 
 ception her communication met with from him. The 
 worthy Baronet's confidence in his own judgment had 
 been considerably shaken by the unfortunate conse- 
 quences that had resulted from his acquaintance with 
 Colonel Algernon, and the discovery of having been 
 so fatally deceived by a Young Man in whose can- 
 dour and honour he had placed the firmest reliance. — 
 While his opinion of Lady Fauconberg's discernment 
 had been greatly strengthened by the consciousness 
 of her having formed a far juster estimate of the 
 Colonel's character, and having even foreseen, almost 
 fi-om the moment of his introduction to them, — all 
 that had actually happened afterwards. — He was 
 pleased with the delicacy and propriety of Mr. Shir- 
 ley's conduct in having contrived to absent himself 
 from Fauconberg Manor during the time that his 
 society must have proved unwelcome and embarras-

 sing to its Inmates ; and he was much touched by the 
 unvarying constancy of his affection for Adelaide. In 
 short, he regretted sincerely that William had not 
 been the first Object of her choice ; and while he did 
 not hesitate to express this feeling to Lady Faucon- 
 berg, he accompanied it by a wish that the Heir of 
 Greyfield might yet some day or other become their 
 Son-in-Law. 
 
 More improbable events Sir George well knew had 
 come to pass, and he kindly and wisely resolved to 
 leave things to take their own free course. He per- 
 ceived that Adelaide had already learnt to like and 
 esteem Mr. Shirley as a Companion and a Friend, 
 but he also observed that if in an unguarded moment, 
 he betrayed any unusual tenderness of sentiment oi 
 manner, — the cold and almost reproachful way ii 
 which she repelled such advances, recalled him to his 
 recollection, and proved that she would consider an 
 open avowal of attachment as insulting. 
 
 Month succeeded month; more than a year had 
 passed since Henry Algernon's departure, and no fur- 
 ther tidings of him had been heard by Adelaide. The

 Fauconbergs and Shirleys lived so constantly toge- 
 ther that they seemed to form but one Family, and it 
 was with extreme reluctance that William was obliged 
 to leave a party which generally included the Object 
 most dear to him in the world, — by a summons to go 
 up to Town and attend his less attractive Parlia- 
 mentary Duties. 
 
 The morning after their Neighbour had bade them 
 adieu, Sir George found his Daughter employed in 
 studying attentively a new Publication which WilHam 
 had left with her,- — and looking he fancied rather more 
 pensive than usual. She laid down her Book when 
 her Father entered the room, and made some obser- 
 vations upon the subject she had been reading about ; 
 but Sir George did not appear much inclined to 
 carry on the discussion, indeed he cut it short by en- 
 quiring ' if the Volume she had just placed upon the 
 table did not belong to WilHam Shirley ? On being 
 answered in the affirmative, a long pause ensued, 
 which was at last broken by the Baronet. — 
 
 " Adelaide," said he, " we are I believe both think- 
 ing of the same person, but probably with very 
 different feelings."

 slightly as she spoke. " I was wondering she added, 
 " what could make ijou so grave and absent? But I 
 did not feel myself quite entitled to ask you such a 
 question." 
 
 " I will very readily gratify your curiosity upon 
 that point my dear Child," continued Sir George; 
 ^' you will perhaps be a little startled by what I 
 am going to say to you ; but you are so well aware 
 that the first and most anxious wish of my heart is 
 to promote Your happiness, that you need not be

 would, according to my ideas, — ^be instrumental in 
 contributing to the future security of your comfort 
 and peace of mind. I now propose only to throw out 
 hints for your consideration, — to request you to listen 
 to them attentively and to weigh them carefully. I 
 do not expect or require you to express your opinion 
 upon them, — whatever it may be ; until you have had 
 time to reflect upon them dispassionately ; and I trust 
 it is unnecessary to assure you, that if after mature 
 and unprejudiced deliberation, you still find that you

 cannot bring yourself to'look upon your prospects in 
 the same light that I do, I will never urge you to 
 consent to any measure, desu-able as it may seem, that 
 does not accord with your own incUnation." 
 
 " I hope," said Adelaide with a look of great un- 
 easiness and apprehension, — " that in this instance, 
 
 and in every other, I shall be able 1 shall find no 
 
 difficulty — in making my inclination accord with 
 your wishes." 
 
 " Of your desire to do so I am well satisfied," re- 
 plied Sir George, " and that will do nmch in assist- 
 ing you. — I am going to plead the cause Adelaide, 
 of a person who dares not venture to be his own Ad- 
 vocate ; and I trust that I shall not plead in vain. This 
 has ver}^ long been upon my mind, — the fear of dis- 
 tressing you, alone prevented my speaking sooner; 
 indeed I formed a resolution never to mention the 
 subject to you. But circumstances and observations 
 have induced me to adopt another hue of conduct, 
 and I feel that it is almost a duty I owe both to your- 
 self and William Shirley, to bring you to a mutual 
 understanding- of your real sentiments towards each

 Other. I do not believe you are exactly aware that 
 his attachment to you, — as if strengthened by time 
 and adverse occurrences, is at this moment more de- 
 voted, if possible, than ever it was." 
 
 Miss Fauconberg's face became crimson as she 
 asked her Father in a faint voice '• if William Shir- 
 ley had requested him to make her this communi- 
 cation V 
 
 " So far from it," said Sir George, " that he has 
 never even talked to me of his feelings. — The truth 
 of my statement is clearly discernible in every turn 
 of his conduct, every action, every look. His con- 
 stant and anxious desire to please you and to conci- 
 liate your good opinion, affords a stronger proof of 
 his affection, than the most eloquent and high sound- 
 ing professions. Existence seems to be enjoyable 
 to him only in your presence, — his happiness depends 
 upon your smile, — yet with a singular delicacy and 
 self-denial, he has contrived to conceal from you a 
 passion, the discovery of which might, I suspect he 
 apprehends, give you pain or uneasiness." 
 
 " Alas !" observed Adelaide, " It appears as if

 William and I were doomed by some perverse des- 
 tiny, always to be the occasion of misery to each 
 other ! Could he have been satisfied by my regard- 
 ing him as a Friend, as a Brother, — there is nobody 
 for whom I could have felt — I did feel — a more sin- 
 cere esteem, — whose society could be more agreable 
 to me. But oh, if he entertains a thought of per- 
 suading me to look upon him in another character ; 
 
 it cannot be, ^I feel that it is impossible." And 
 
 as she concluded these words, she hurst into tears, 
 and wrung her hands in an agony of distress. 
 
 Sir George entreated her to compose herself, and 
 to recollect that it had been his intention merely to 
 reason with her as a Counsellor and Companion, not 
 to chelate to her as a Parent. 
 
 " I know full well," continued he, ^' that what has 
 passed cannot be obliterated from your memory, — 
 that there are some things that can never be for- 
 gotten ; but I am very desirous to lead you to direct

 joyment in store for you ; and that you will be re-

 paid hereafter for the anguish and disquietude you 
 have latterly suffered. William Shirley would not 
 expect you to love him in the romantic sense of the 
 word ; it is not perhaps probable you should feel 
 again as you have done formerly ; he would be per- 
 fectly contented with such a rational esteem and 
 affection as a heart naturally warm as yours, might 
 still I am persuaded be able to accord him. I will 
 not expatiate upon his merit, since you have had so 
 many opportunities of becoming fully acquainted with 
 it. Nor will I praise his matchless constancy, much 
 as I think it deserves to be rewarded. Your Mother 
 and I shall of course desire to see you some day or 
 other placed at the head of an Establishment of your 
 own, in short to find you another Protector before we 
 are ourselves called upon to leave the world ; and as 
 all persons seem to be alike indifferent to you at pre- 
 sent, — 1 own I cannot help very much wishing that 
 that Protector may be William Shirley. — What I 
 now request of you my dear Adelaide, is to endea- 
 vour to like him, and to try impartially to ascertain 
 if you may not have been a little mistaken in believ-

 ing it so very impossible you should ever be disposed 
 to accept him without reluctance as your Husband." 
 
 Adelaide was silent for some minutes, her tears 
 flowed fast, but at length making an effort to restrain 
 them she replied, 
 
 '^ I will certainly strive to obey you Papa. — I 
 know," she added, " that William Sliirley's kind- 
 ness, generosity, and faith, — far exceed my deserts ; 
 I feel too that I am bound in gratitude to do all I can 
 to assist in promoting his happiness ; — but how is it 
 possible I should be able to contribute towards con- 
 ferring upon another, that which has so long ago, and 
 for ever, deserted myself?"

 Adelaide was true to the promise she had given 
 her Father ; from the hour of her conversation with 
 him, she sincerely endeavoured to reconcile her mind 
 to the idea of a Union with Mr. Shirley, which she now 
 considered almost as inevitable ; — a sort of impend- 
 ing misfortune which she had not the power entirely 
 to avert, but which she felt herself justified in wish- 
 ing to put off till the remotest possible period. She 
 found the task she had undertaken however, so diffi- 
 cult and painful, that her Spirits nearly sunk under it. 
 Her present life was embittered by a continual men- 
 tal conflict; and she dared not look forward to any

 change, — since the prospect presented to her by 
 the future was still more comfortless and wretched. 
 When she attempted, as she frequently did ; to do 
 justice to William's amiable and agreable qualities, — 
 a contrast between him and Colonel Algernon, highly 
 unfavourable to the former, always started up before 
 her imagination, and defeated her praise-worthy in- 
 tention. She was unwilling to confess even to her- 
 self, how strong a hold Henry still maintained upon 
 her affections; nor would she have easily acknow- 
 ledged that her keenest anguish was occasioned by the 
 consciousness of the pangs he would suffer if he were 
 to hear that she had consented to bestow her hand 
 upon his former Rival. 
 
 In spite of all her efforts to subdue her rebellious 
 feelings, they became so oppressive that she deter- 
 mined at length to describe the state of her mind to 
 her Father, and submissively to plead her repug- 
 nance to the Engagement which he and her Mother 
 had projected for her. She owned with deep regret 
 her culpable weakness in being unable to forget an 
 attachment which had proved unfortunate to others as

 well as to herself, — but feeling towards Colonel Al- 
 g-ernon as she feared she should unhappily always do, 
 she said ' she did not think she ought conscientiously 
 to agree to become the Wife of any one else. She 
 was ready to put all selfish considerations and objec- , 
 tions quite out of the question, but it seemed to her ! 
 that she should act unkindly and unworthily by Mr. i 
 Shirley if she consented to unite herself indissolubly ! 
 to him, — when she knew she should afterwards be 
 incapable of doing her duty properly and cheerfully 
 towards him. — ^It would be a jDoor return for his un- 
 varying affection for her, to chain him for life to a 
 cold hearted and melancholy Companion, whose 
 thoughts in spite of herself would be too likely to 
 stray back to the recollection of another. It was 
 not improbable in the course of events, that after she 
 had been several years William Shirley's Wife, she 
 might accidentally meet that other person in society ; 
 and how would her husband feel, how could she her- 
 self ever recover lier shame and distress if under such 
 circumstances she should be unable to conceal the 
 agony and emotion she should too surely experience

 al seeing him ? The possibility of an exposure of 
 this description having once occuiTed to her, was alone 
 sufficient ahnost to convince her, (she concluded,) 
 that while Colonel Algernon lived, which would be 
 most likely much longer than herself; it would be 
 both wrong and unprincipled, if she did not at least 
 forcibly state her desire to remain unmarried.' 
 
 Sir George had for some time watched the strug- 
 gle in his Daughter's mind too attentively to be at all 
 surprised by what he now heard. He saw that it 
 would be both barbarous and unavailing, at any rate 
 at present, — to urge her further upon a point which 
 was evidently so distressing to her feehngs, that if he 
 persevered in exacting her compHance ; it threatened 
 not only to endanger her health, but to destroy her 
 happiness. He therefore told her, " that he felt very 
 much obliged to her for the efforts he was aware she 
 had made to bring herself to comply without reluc- 
 tance with the proposal he had suggested to her: 
 that he was very sorry her endeavours had not been 
 crowned with success, but as he was now satisfied 
 that could not be, he would no longer torment her

 upon the subject ; — he desired her not to think of it 
 again, — to dismiss it entirely from her recollection." 
 
 Adelaide was inexpressibly relieved by her Fa- 
 ther's kind and indulgent consideration. She at- 
 tempted in vain to give utterance to her gratitude; 
 but Sir George was sufficiently rewarded for what 
 he had done, by perceiving the immediate and 
 happy alteration that took place in his Daughter's 
 whole manner and appearance, which had previously 
 been miserably dejected. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was not much delighted with 
 the result of her Husband's attempts to make an im- 
 pression in Mr. Shirley's favour, upon Adelaide's 
 mind. She fancied she could have managed the 
 matter far better if it had been left solely in her 
 hands ; and although after what had passed, she did 
 not venture to hazard any direct or open attack in 
 behalf of her ProtCj^e, she continually teased Adelaide 
 with arguments and insinuations in his praise, which 
 could not be mistaken, and only tended to place him 
 in a disagreable and unwelcome point of view; — 
 thus defeating her own purpose, and causing an

 effect exactly the reverse of the one it was intended 
 to produce. 
 
 One morning very soon after the party at Faucon- 
 berg had returned from London ; while her Ladyship 
 was reading the Newspaper at breakfast time accord- 
 ing to her usual custom, — ^her eye glanced upon a 
 Name which instantly arrested her attention. She 
 started, reddened, fidgetted about upon her chair, 
 and looked so important that Sir George asked her 
 what extraordinary event she had discovered? and 
 begged she would no longer conceal it from them. 
 She made a sign to him to be silent, and a few 
 minutes afterwards, when Adelaide's head was turn- 
 ed in another direction, Lady Fauconberg took the 
 opportunity of handing the Paper to her Husband, 
 adroitly placing her finger upon the paragraph which 
 had so evidently surprised and interested her. 
 
 It was an announcement of the death of Lieuten- 
 ant Colonel Henry Algernon, Grandson of Lord Al- 
 tamont ; briefly stating the circumstance having taken 
 place in the West Indies, and naming the day of 
 the week and month on which it had occurred.

 Sir George was extremely shocked ! He would 
 perhaps have been glad to be assured that Henry 
 would never come back to England, but there was 
 something very melancholy in this premature termi- 
 nation of a career which at one time had promised to 
 be both brilliant and happy ; and he was the more 
 affected by it, because he was conscious that despair 
 at his separation from Adelaide had been the imme- 
 diate cause which prompted the unfortunate Young 
 Man to expatriate himself, and remove to the un- 
 healthy climate which had probably proved fatal to him. 
 
 The Baronet had a painful and distressing duty 
 to perform, in communicating the sad news to his 
 Daughter. She had suspected fi'om her Mother's 
 manner, and his own visible emotion, that all was not 
 right; but she was far from being prepared to hear 
 such deeply afflicting inteUigence, — and at first she 
 was quite overcome by the violence of her grief. 
 
 Henry's death revived with redoubled force all her 
 long smothered affection. Every thing that was 
 amiable and engaging in his character ; — his talents, 
 his accomplishments, — recurred vividly to her recol-

 lection ; while his faults were palliated or forgotten, 
 and his misfortunes pitied and deplored. Those con- 
 siderations which had agitated Sir George, flashed 
 across Adelaide's mind with far greater hitterness, 
 and long continued to haunt her imagination. She 
 would have given kingdoms to know what had heen 
 the state of Colonel Algernon's feelings after he left 
 England; how he had employed his time: — and to 
 learn all the melancholy particular's of his illness, and 
 of his last moments ? She was anxious too to hear 
 in what manner poor Lord Altamont had borne the 
 dreadful calamity that had fallen upon him in his old 
 aore ? She thouofht she could feel much better satis- 
 fied if she had been informed upon each of these 
 points ; but a sort of false shame restrained her from 
 confessing her anxious curiosity ; and as she did not 
 ask a single question, or express the least wish that 
 any enquiries should be made concerning the details 
 or the cause of Henry's untimely fate, — her Parents 
 carefully avoided ever alluding to the subject, or 
 naming him in her presence. 
 
 They wisely determined to let her son'ow exhaust

 itself by allowing it to take its own natural course, 
 but as soon as they perceived that its poignancy be- 
 gan to abate, Lady Fauconberg attempted to give 
 her consolation in the way she deemed most likely to 
 be attended with success ; and Sir George, by alter- 
 nately soothing her feelings and strengthening her 
 principles, contrived to administer much more wel- 
 come and judicious comfort to her wounded Spirit. 
 
 In a few weeks Adelaide regained her outward 
 composure and even cheerfulness, but a great change 
 had been wrought u]3on her mind. A lingering 
 feeling towards Henry had, unknown to herself, 
 formed a kind of tie, which as long as he lived had 
 in some degree attached her to the world. 
 
 That tie was now cut asunder for ever, and all 
 earthly interest of a personal nature had been annihi- 
 lated by its dissolution. The only object and desire 
 that remained to promise her satisfaction, and to ani- 
 mate her to exertion, — was her hope of being able 
 still to contribute to the happiness of her Parents ; 
 and her anxiety, at least to endeavour, to make them 
 the best return in her power for all their kindness.

 She knew they hotli wished that she should many 
 Mr. Shirley, indeed her Mother took great care to 
 keep that conviction aUve in her memory; and al- 
 though the idea of such an Alliance was far from 
 being less painful and disagreahle to her now than it 
 had been formerly, she resolved by a vigorous deter- 
 mination to set aside all objections of her own, and to 
 sacrifice her feelings to her sense of duty. Having 
 once come to this decision, she had too much firmness 
 to delay putting it into execution. She summoned 
 all her fortitude to support her, and taking an oppor- 
 tunity when Sir George and Lady Fauconberg were 
 together, of disclosing to then her purpose; she told 
 them ' that since those obstacles were now removed 
 which had induced her to consider that it would be 
 little less than a crime in her to accept William Shir- 
 ley as her Husband ; she weis very willing to retract 
 that part of her former opposition to his suit which 
 had been dictated by conscientious motives ; and even 
 to accompany him to the Altar, if she could believe 
 it probable he could still desire to receive so worthless 
 a Gift as her Hand, aware as he must be of her ina- 
 bility to bestow upon him her Heart also.'

 Her Mother was not less surprised than enchanted 
 by an overture v/hich unexpectedly promised at last 
 to crown her favorite scheme with complete success, 
 and she was lavish in her commendations and expres- 
 sions of tenderness towards Adelaide. Sir George 
 was deeply affected. He admired the exalted prin- 
 ciple which enabled his Daughter to come forward 
 in this noble manner, and he appreciated the strength 
 of that attachment for himself and for her Mother, 
 which he well knew could alone have induced her to 
 think of doing so. He explained all these feelings to 
 her with the greatest possible kindness. He said that 
 he still looked upon the alliance with Mr. Shirley as 
 every way desirable ; but he requested her to take a 
 little more time to consider about it, and advised her 
 by no means to decide in a hurry upon a measure of 
 such importance to her future happiness. 
 
 The tears came into Adelaide's eyes while she was 
 thanking her Father very gratefully for his goodness; 
 But she told him in a firm voice, '' that her mind was 
 made up ; and as she had deliberately weighed every 
 circumstance connected with this subject, any further 
 consideration of it would only perplex her."

 She added in a more hasty tone, " that she could 
 perfectly depend upon herself at present, but she was 
 not equally sure that she might always be able to do 
 so." 
 
 " All that you say is very true, extremely sensible, 
 my dear Adelaide," exclaimed Lady Fauconberg, 
 who began to be much afraid of the turn the conver- 
 sation seemed hkely to take. " When an affair of 
 this kind is fairly detennined upon, the sooner it can 
 take place the better. The intermediate period must 
 always be so awkward and disagreable, that unne- 
 cessary delays are both unpleasant and injudicious. 
 — Surely," continued she, addressing herself to her 
 Husband, " We have every reason to wish that in 
 this instance the term of trial and anxiety that pre- 
 cedes a Marriage should be as little protracted as 
 possible." 
 
 " Your arguments are unanswerable," replied Sir 
 George, " but still I must think this matter over 
 again, and talk it over again, before I can see it 
 exactly in the same light that you do." 
 
 Adelaide scarcely dared to listen to her Father's

 representations. She found a desperate sort of relief 
 in the consciousness that it was no longer in her 
 power to hesitate or shrink back from her purpose ; 
 and she retired to her own room, unhappy indeed, — 
 but vvell satisfied with herself. 
 
 " I cannot," said Sir Georg-e, when he found him- 
 self alone with Lady Fauconberg, " feel contented in 
 any respect with the idea of that poor Child's entering 
 into a Marriage to please us, which is still evidently 
 repugant to her own inclination. Her offering to do 
 so is a noble instance of self devotion, but it strikes 
 me that we shall act both a cruel and an unjustifiable 
 part, if we agree to it. — Happiness after all is much 
 more dependant upon the mind than ujion any out- 
 ward circumstances. It cannot in any shape be forced 
 upon us against our will. And as the plan of it we 
 had traced out for Adelaide, unluckily presents no- 
 thing but misery to her imagination, it appears to me 
 that it would be barbarous kindness to insist upon her 
 adopting it." 
 
 " Your scruples are so indulgent and so amiable," 
 replied her Ladyship, " that it is impossible not to

 admire them; but according to my opinion of the 
 case, they are mistaken. Adelaide's mind has for 
 more than three years been perpetually harrassed 
 and distracted in various ways, in consequence of 
 her unfortunate attachment for Colonel Algernon. 
 That attachment formed the only real impediment 
 to her liking any body else, and there can be no 
 doubt that it will now insensibly diminish and die 
 away, from the loss of its Object. The most desi- 
 rable expedient we can employ to supply the blank it 
 must leave in her heart, is to allow her to form an 
 engagement which will oblige her to endeavour to 
 transfer her affections to a Companion who is in every 
 respect worthy of obtaining them ; and I will confi- 
 dently predict that if she attempts in the first instance 
 to attach herself to him merely as a point of duty, she 
 will very soon learn to do so from inclination. — She 
 has good sense enough to be perfectly aware of the 
 truth of all this, — And I am very far from wishing in 
 the slightest degree to diminish the extraordinary 
 merit of her conduct, when I say that if she had not 
 been so, she would never have made that heroic pro-

 position which we are at this moment discussing. It 
 is certainly evident that she still feels reluctant to 
 think of a second choice ; but it is equally plain that 
 with all her resolution, she knows that she should be 
 unable entirely to overcome that weakness should she 
 even remain her whole life unmarried, — since she has 
 herself told us she is convinced that it will he better 
 for her that every thing should be arranged as spee- 
 dily as possible. — Peculiarly situated as our Daughter 
 is at present, we ought to consider ourselves particu- 
 larly fortunate in having it in our power to bestow 
 her upon a Husband, whom we should have regarded 
 as singularly desirable under any circumstances ; a 
 Young Man of whose devoted, — I might almost say 
 unexampled affection for her, we are perfectly as- 
 sured ; and the first and principal object of whose 
 future existence will be to render her comfortable 
 and happy."

 which you have always seen Adelaide's concerns, has 
 been widely different from mine ; but I must acknow-

 tions ; and experience has given me too much reason 
 to place a stronger degree of confidence in your 
 judgement than in my own. One consideration alone 
 sticks painfully in my throat. — Should our dear Ade- 
 laide become Mrs. Shirley through our persuasion, 
 and should her marriage not prove a happy one, how 
 should we ever be able to forgive ourselves ?" 
 
 " I think," answered Lady Fauconberg, " that I 
 might venture to ensure you from any danger of that 
 kind. I should feel much greater apprehensions upon 
 Adelaide's account, if she were to remain single. In 
 that case we might too probably have to endure the 
 grief of seeing her pine away, a victim to early and 
 hopeless disappointment!" 
 
 The Baronet was silent for many minutes. At 
 length he exclaimed, " Lady Fauconberg you have 
 gained your point. I am determined to be guided by 
 your advice, and I hope we shall neither of us ever 
 have cause to regret a step which we are both about 
 to take with the best intentions." 
 
 Her Ladyship was so delighted with her victory, 
 that she received the flattering mark of deference to

 her opinion which her Husband had thus given her 
 in an unusually gracious and conciliatory manner. 
 She employed every argument she could think of, to 
 overcome his present apprehensions, and to encourage 
 him to form more pleasing anticipations of the future ; 
 And when she fancied that her endeavours had pro- 
 duced the desired effect, — she observed, 
 
 " That if he did not disapprove of such a measure, 
 she would send a Note to William Shirley before 
 breakfast the next morning, to invite him to ride over 
 to Fauconberg, as if accidentally, either that day or 
 the day following." 
 
 " That would indeed be hurrying on matters with 
 a vengeance," said Sir George. " Surely it will be 
 soon enough to speak to him the next time we hap- 
 pen to see him." 
 
 " In the natural course of events," pursued Lady 
 Fauconberg, " it is very doubtful when such a meet- 
 ing may take place. — For very obvious reasons Wil- 
 liam has abstained from coming here lately ; and 
 even when we go to Grey field, we are not certain of 
 fnidinsr him there."

 " Well, summon him if you please," concluded 
 Sir George, " but remember that this concern re- 
 quires very delicate management, and beware of 
 doing any thing too precipitate." 
 
 Her Ladyship readily promised to act with the 
 greatest prudence and circumspection, and having 
 obtained her Husband's permission to despatch the 
 note to Mr. Shirley, she hastened away to her own 
 room to write it. 
 
 The next morning it suited Lady Fauconberg's 
 fancy to go out walking earl>^ and alone. She turned 
 her steps in the direction of the road to Greyfield, 
 and she had not proceeded very far when she per- 
 ceived a Horseman advancing towards her at a rapid 
 pace. It will readily be conjectured that this Cavalier 
 was Mr. Shirley, and the nature of the conversation 
 that took place after he had joined her Ladyship, may 
 as easily be imagined. 
 
 William was enthusiastic in his expressions of de- 
 light at hearing of the unlooked for happiness that 
 awaited him ; and equally warm in his declarations 
 of gratituilu towards the kind Friend to whose good

 offices, he said, he was aware he should be principally 
 indebted for it. 
 
 To prevent their meeting from having the appear- 
 ance of a preconcerted scheme, they sejjarated at the 
 edge of the Park ; the Lady walked straight back to 
 the House, while the Gentleman took a long circuit 
 to give her time to get home and even to rest herself 
 before his arrival. 
 
 Adelaide started violently when the Visitor's name 
 was announced. The blood too rushed up into her 
 face, but her Mother fancied that this was rather from 
 surprise, not perhaps quite unmingled with a more 
 angry sentiment, than from confusion. She instantly 
 recovered he i self, however, and making a great effort 
 to command her rebellious feelings, she held out her 
 hand to Mr. Shirley with a calm and encouraging 
 smile. 
 
 Sir George, who came into the room immediately 
 afterwards, gave him a most cordial reception ; and 
 though nothing was said by either of the parties 
 which could lead them to regard this visit as essen- 
 tially different from any other visit, it was evident

 ADELAIDE. 187 
 
 from the manner of each that they did so ; In short, 
 there was a sort of mutual consciousness which im- 
 phed that Mr. Shirley was tacitly considered as having 
 presented himself in the character of Miss Faucon- 
 berg's accepted Admirer. 
 
 William found it no easy task to restrain his satis- 
 faction within the bounds of decorum. He did indeed 
 think he might venture to treat Adelaide with unusu- 
 ally marked attention ; and he was not a little elated 
 by observing that these demonstrations of devotion 
 seemed no longer to give her displeasure. 
 
 At length he rose to depart. Lady Fauconberg 
 enquired when they should see him again ? And Sir 
 George very kindly observed, " That the sooner and 
 the oftener he could come to Fauconberg, the better 
 they should all be satisfied." 
 
 Mr. Shirley looked tow^ards his " Lady-Love" as 
 if he flattered himself tliat she would also join in this 
 invitation, but as she remained silent, he said to her 
 in a low voice, " May I hope, Adelaide, that if I pro- 
 fit by so tempting a permission to repeat my visits to 
 your Father, my doing so will not be disagreable to 
 You ?"

 188 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " I should be very ungrateful," replied she firmly, 
 " if I were not always glad to see you." 
 
 It was in a more tremulous tone that she added, — 
 
 " You are well acquainted with my sentiments ; 
 I am likewise no Stranger to Yours ; it would there- 
 fore be vain to pretend that I had not understood the 
 full import of your questior." 
 
 This avowal was perhaps more than William had 
 a right to expect, yet it did not entirely content him. 
 Turning to address himself again to Sir George and 
 Lady Fauconberg, he said, 
 
 " 1 have an Engagement for to-morrow, which is 
 Tuesday is it not ? But since you are so good as to 
 ask me to come here as frequently as I can, I shall be 
 most happy to dine wdth you on Wednesday — if that 
 day will perfectly suit your convenience." 
 
 " On Wednesday then we shall expect to see you," 
 answered the Baronet, as he cordially shook his hand. 
 And thus terminated an interview, which as Adelaide 
 thought to herself, had irrevocably sealed her fate. 
 She had indeed declined her Father's kind proposal 
 of delay and re-consideration, — hut she could not help 
 feeling that matters had been hurried on with extra-

 ADELAIDE. 189 
 
 ordinary rapidity, and that there could have been no 
 possible necessity to bring them so precipitately to a 
 settlement. — She had no doubt that this ari'angement 
 had been devised and advocated by her Mother. She 
 was hurt by the want of confidence in her own firm- 
 ness and sincerity — ^which it seemed to imply; and 
 she determined that her future conduct should prove 
 how very little this had been merited. 
 
 It is scarcely necessary to observe that Mr. Shirley 
 was punctual in keeping his eng-agement at Faucon- 
 berof Manor. 
 
 The Dinner was rather stiff, and there was a de- 
 gree of restraint and awkwardness in Sir George's 
 demeanour when he found it necessary, after the 
 Ladies had retired, to introduce the subject of his 
 Daughter's concerns. He referred to the communi- 
 cations which he understood had been made at various 
 times by his Guest, to Lady Fauconberg". He de- 
 scribed the present state of Adelaide's sentiments ; 
 and he finally assured his future Son-in-Law of his 
 own deserved esteem and approbation. 
 
 William's pride was wounded ; his Spirits had

 190 ADELAIDE. 
 
 received a chill, and he began to look forward with an 
 unpleasant sort of feeling to his approaching explana- 
 tion with Adelaide. 
 
 Nothing could, in fact, be less gi-atifying to his va- 
 nity than the candid confession she made to him of 
 her attachment to the memory of his Rival, and the 
 inability she honorably acknowledged of returning 
 his own generous affection in the manner it deserved. 
 He carefully repressed all outward appearance of 
 mortification at hearing these unpleasant truths, and 
 assured her that ' he respected all her feelings far too 
 much to wish or to require of her ever to give up one 
 cherished recollection for his sake.' In short, he was 
 evidently determined to accept her faith upon any 
 terms, provided he could only succeed in persuading 
 her to promise she would bestow it upon him. 
 
 The following morning Mr. Shirley rode over to 
 Greyfield to announce his approaching marriage to 
 his Father and Sisters. He was also charged with 
 a message to them from his Host and Hostess, which 
 proposed that they should all return with him to Fau- 
 conberg and offer their congratulations in person to 
 his affianced Bride.

 Sir William's joy was unbounded when he heard 
 that Adelaide had actually consented to become his 
 Daughter-in-Law. He had susj^ected from his Son's 
 excited manner, after his last visit to his Friends, that 
 something of the kind was in agitation ; but he had 
 not dared to hope that what he had always ardently 
 wished, would he so speedily and agreably settled. 
 
 Emily learnt with great interest and satisfaction 
 that a near relationship would soon unite her more 
 closely to her beloved Companion. She participated 
 heartily in her Brother's happiness ; — ^but surprise and 
 pleasure seemed to have deprived her of the power of 
 giving utterance to her feelings, for she said very 
 little, and had the air of a person suddenly plunged 
 into a deep reverie. 
 
 Julia, on the contrary, who probably jTe/i much less 
 warmly upon this occasion than her Sister, was elo- 
 quent in her felicitations ; — and expressions of asto- 
 nishment and delight flowed with even more than 
 usual fluency from her lips. 
 
 '' Let me recommend you Julia," said her Father, 
 " to moderate your raptures, at least for a few mi-

 nutes, while you make your preparations to present 
 yourself before Mrs. Shirley Elect. — William is no 
 doubt much too impatient to get back to Fauconberg, 
 to wait here until it is time for us to set out ; he can 
 announce our approach, and I shall not pity him for 
 having a solitary ride to day since his own thoughts 
 have such a pleasant suLject to expatiate upon, — and 
 his future prospects are now all couleur de rose." 
 
 Had the Baronet been able however to read what 
 was passing in his Son's mind when he retraced his 
 steps to the abode of his Promise, he would have dis- 
 covered that his reflections were of a less agreable 
 description than he very naturally imagined them 
 to be. 
 
 In the certainty of being united to Adelaide, Wil- 
 liam had indeed at length attained the fulfilment of the 
 wish nearest to his heart; but by what means had 
 that object been accompUshed ? — This was a question 
 that touched him to the quick ; he shrunk away from 
 it as he would have done from an Adder in his path ; 
 for his conscience loudly forbade him to answer it 
 satisfactorily. He was well aware that Lady Fau-

 conberg's specious arg-umeiits and unceasing persecu- 
 tions, could alone have persuaded her Husband and 
 goaded on her unhappy Daughter to agree to an en- 
 gagement which was entered into against the judge- 
 ment of the one and the inclination of the other. He 
 knew tliat as she had fonnerly felt no scruple in re- 
 sorting to the most unjustifiable arts, to bend them to 
 her purpose, she had even now deceived and imposed 
 upon them in various ways ; in fine that she had 
 merely urged the expediency of a precipitate settle- 
 ment and declaration of the marriage, to prevent the 
 possibility of her Victim's retracting her consent to it. 
 — Adelaide had herself told him that she could never 
 love liim ; and he could not help internally despising 
 the cruel and ungenerous part he had acted in accept- 
 ing the hand which according to her own acknow- 
 ledgement she had offered to him so reluctantly. — 
 He endeavoured in vain to stifle his mental reproaches, 
 — they contimied to torment him till he rejoined Lady 
 Fauconberg and Adelaide; when the gracious re- 
 ception he met with from the former, and still more 
 the smile, faint as it was, — with which he was greeted

 by the latter, — soon banished them from his recollec- 
 tion. 
 
 Adelaide appeared excessively nervous during the 
 first few minutes after her meeting with Sir William 
 Shirley and his Daughters. She was much affected 
 by the kindness of the worthy Baronet's truly pater- 
 nal ^congratulations, while he in return was not a 
 little pleased with the engaging manner in which she 
 received them. She attempted to laugh with Julia, 
 and at the same time to check those expressions of 
 delight which were really distressing to her ; by de- 
 claring ' that she was always emban-assed by com- 
 pliments,' — and adding, ' that as she intended in 
 future to keep all wild-spirited people in good order, 
 — she should be bold enough even to try to exert her 
 dominion over Julia.' But this affectation of playful- 
 ness did not sit easy upon our poor Heroine. It was 
 evidently assumed with great effort ; and when Emily 
 assured her in a few words of heartfelt tenderness, 
 " that she had so long regarded her with the feelings 
 of a Sister, that she did not believe she could love her 
 more when she actually became one to her;" Ade- 
 laide burst into tears.

 ADELAIDE. 195 
 
 She soon recovered herself however, seemed much 
 vexed with the weakness she had betrayed, and main- 
 tained her composure during the rest of the day at 
 the expense of an exertion which nobody who was 
 unacquainted with the real state of her mind, could 
 possibly have estimated. 
 
 When the Miss Shirleys had retired at night to 
 their own room, Julia said to her Sister : 
 
 " Upon my word you look so grave and thoughtful 
 Emily, that a Stranger would never suspect j^ou were 
 but just returned from a happy visit of congratulation." 
 
 " You should remember," replied Emily attempt- 
 ing to smile as she brushed away a tear, " that a mar- 
 riage is a very serious affair." 
 
 " To the parties concerned I can well believe that 
 it is, but I see no reason why their Relations should 
 consider it so. Our Elders for instance, who must be 
 wiser than we are, have set us a very difterent ex- 
 ample. Lady Fauconberg is the picture of delight 
 and importance ; Sir George appears extremely well 
 pleased ; and my Father's joy and satisfaction are 
 
 visible enough in his countenance.'

 " All this is very true, " continued Emily with a 
 sigh, '' and I most sincerely wish that the Union 
 which is so deeply interesting to us all, may prove a 
 happy one." 
 
 " But you have uncomfortable misgivings upon 
 that subject," observed Julia, " have you not? — ^I am 
 now going to speak rationally ; and in sober sadness 
 I must confess that I cannot like this match. — It was 
 perhaps quite selon les regies that Adelaide should 
 appear awkward and nervous when first she saw us ; 
 it might even he interesting that she should be over- 
 come when you wished her joy ; hut there was a 
 forced gaiety in her voice, and a desperate calmness in 
 her air afterwards, that were both shocking and unna- 
 tural. She gave me the idea of a self-devoted Vic- 
 tim, prepared to meet her doom with unshaken firm- 
 ness; and William for whose sake the sacrifice was 
 to be offered, looked now and then very much as if 
 he thought that even after he had led her to the Al- 
 tar, he might still find himself a disappointed Man" 
 "• If William ever repents the step he is going to 
 take," said Emilv, " it will be when it is too late.

 He has long persuaded himself that the person who 
 can be fortunate enough to become Adelaide's Hus- 
 band, will have nothing left to wish for. We have 
 only to desire that he may be spared the pain of 
 learning from experience that in some instances, 
 ' Our very wishes give us not our wish.' — With our 
 future Sister, the case is perfectly dissimilar. As 
 she looks forward to the prospect before her with 
 hopeless indifference, she is at least secure from dis- 
 appointment ; and it is even probable that her Mar- 
 riage may prove a source of greater comfort to her 
 than she now expects." 
 
 " I shall rejoice if it does," continued JuHa, " but 
 to my poor apprehension, if as You seem to insinuate, 
 and / have always believed ; her attachment to her 
 first and faithless Lover, has been too strong to allow 
 her ever to like any body else ; she has made a sad 
 mistake in agreeing to enter into the Estate of holy 
 Matrimony merely to pLase her selfish and intrigue- 
 ing Mother." 
 
 " Had I b.'cn placed in similar circumstances," re- 
 plied Emily, ^' I certainly think I should not have

 acted as she has done ; but it is impossihle not to ad- 
 mire the dutiful and disinterested motives which ena- 
 bled her to set aside her own feehngs to obey and 
 gratify the wishes of her Parents. Adelaide's con- 
 duct has at all times been exemplary, but upon the 
 present occasion it is beyond all praise." 
 
 Julia perceived from the guarded nature of her 
 Sister's observations, that she had either been admit- 
 ted so deeply into her Friend's confidence, that she 
 could not speak with freedom upon the subject of 
 their discussion ; or that it recalled recollections and 
 sentiments connected with her own situation, which 
 it was painful to her to dwell upon. She therefore 
 determined to press the conversation no further ; 
 and concluded it by remarking " that she was very 
 willing, very desirous, to give Adelaide all the merit 
 she so well deserved, to allow that her character was 
 almost that of an Angel ; but still that if She stood in 
 her Brother's position, with all the world before him, 
 — she should be extremely sorry to select a Help- 
 mate and Companion for life, who was so completely 
 broken in heart and spirit."

 It would be tedious to narrate the occurrences tliat 
 filled up the mterval between Adelaide's acceptance 
 of Mr. Shirley, and the day that was fixed for their 
 mam age. 
 
 William humed on all the arrangements with a 
 feverish sort of impatience that was not quite satisfac- 
 tory to Sir George, but Lady Fauconberg was never 
 at a loss to find arguments to support his cause, while 
 she exerted herself with the greatest activity in assist- 
 ing to expedite the different preparations. Their 
 united efforts prevented any unnecessary delay, and 
 in little more than three weeks every thing was set- 
 tled, and William Vernon who had just taken Orders, 
 was summoned to officiate at his Cousin's Wedding. 
 
 In the mean time Adelaide, who was destined to 
 fill the interesting part of the Heroine of the Scene, 
 had been almost a passive Spectator of what was 
 coino^ on around her. It was in vain that she endea- 
 voured to return William's affection; she still re- 
 garded him with a coldness that seemed to herself to 
 be nearly allied to ingratitude. There was an air 
 too of constant restraint, and often of wildness in his

 manner towards her, which she had never formerly 
 remarked, and which impressed her with a vague 
 kind of distrust not unmingled with fear. 
 
 Mr. Shirley had taken a ready furnished Place, not 
 very far distant from Greyfield and Fauconberg, 
 which happened at the moment to be unoccupied, 
 and which the two Baronets agreed in thinking 
 would be a comfortable temporary Abode for the 
 Young Couple until Sir William had completed the 
 alterations and improvements at an old fashioned 
 House very prettily situated upon one of his own 
 Estates, which it was his intention to fit up for them. 
 
 As the jjeriod of her separation from her Father 
 and Mother approached, Adelaide found it grew more 
 and more difficult every day to keep up her spirits. 
 Her resolution however remained unshaken, and she 
 earnestly prayed that her firmness might not desert 
 her in this hour of trial, and that she might be ena- 
 bled hereafter to do her duty and to feel content in 
 that state of life in which from conscientious prin- 
 ciples she was about to place herself. She was 
 sensible that her licalth and strength were beginning

 to be affected by the inward distress she had suffered, 
 and the extraordinary mental exertion she had made 
 to conceal it ; and she entertained a conviction that 
 her life would be terminated at no very distant sea- 
 son. For the sake of others she had a desire to be 
 mistaken, but upon her own account she looked for- 
 ward to the prospect of an early dissolution without 
 one feeling of regret.

 The morning on which Adelaide's Marriage was 
 to take place, at length arrived. The Ceremony was 
 to be performed at an early hour. William's Sisters 
 were to be the Bride Maids, and nobody besides the 
 members of the two Families, was to be present. A 
 large party of Friends and Neighbours were invited 
 to a Breakfast at Fauconberg Manor after the knot 
 was tied ; but the Bride and Bridegroom were to set 
 out for their own House from the Church Door, as 
 Lady Fauconberg justly apprehended that her Daugh- 
 ter's spirits might give way if she found herself in- 
 troduced as the principal Personage in a numerous 
 Assembly upon so trying an occasion; and that the 
 Congratulations that would pour in upon her from all 
 sides, would in themselves be enough to overcome her.

 For the same reason her Ladyship contrived to put 
 a stop to a sort of Rural Procession which the Tenants 
 and Cottagers on Sir George's Property, had intended 
 to form, in order to show their respect and affection 
 for their Young Lady upon her Wedding Day. She 
 sent them word ' that Miss Fauconberg was much 
 gratified by their kindness, and by the interest they 
 took in her Marriage; but that she much wished to 
 avoid the painflil task of taking leave of them. — She 
 therefore requested, that instead of accompanying her 
 in a body to the Church, they would all come up to 
 the Manor in the afternoon, and drink her health.' 
 
 A handsome Dinner was prepared for all the 
 Farmers and People of better Condition ; and there 
 was to be a Dance in the evening, enlivened by 
 plenty of Ale and good Cheer, for every body who 
 chose to come and partake of it. 
 
 The morning was beautifully fine, and in spite of 
 Lady Fauconberg's intimation, a number of little 
 Groups had began to assemble, and station themselves 
 at different places upon the road, to see thj Bridal 
 Party pass.

 Sir George, who had been unable to sleep during 
 the night, had risen long before his usual time. Be- 
 sides the sorrow he naturally felt at the idea of losing 
 his Daughter, he was disquieted by an anxiety about 
 her future happiness, which arose from the peculiar 
 circumstances that had preceded her Union with Mr. 
 Shirley. He walked up and down the Library with 
 nervous restlessness, — wishing the much dreaded day 
 was over, — and determined to avoid, what he dared 
 not trust himself to encounter, — a private interview 
 with his beloved Adelaide. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg, who had taken upon herself the 
 superintendance of every thing, was all activity, bus- 
 tle, and importance. Most Mothers, in a similar 
 situation, would have felt agitated or overpowered, 
 but she a2)peared to be quite in her element. — One 
 of her first cares was to assist in directing the Toilette 
 of the Bride, who stood pale as death and motionless 
 as a Statue, to be attired in the costly but simple 
 dress that had been pre2)ared for her. 
 
 While her Ladyship was selecting the Ornaments 
 w Inch were to complete her Bridal Costume, Adelaide,

 who felt rather faint, walked to the open window to 
 enjoy the reviving benefit of the fresh air. 
 
 As she g-azed almost unconsciously upon the well 
 known objects in the Landscape before her, her atten- 
 tion was suddenly arrested by a miserable looking 
 Man who had placed himself immediately below the 
 room where she was standing; apparently with the 
 intention of observins; her and of beinsr observed. 
 His clothes were old and ragged, and his tall figure 
 seemed emaciated by want and disease; but there 
 was something so singular and remarkable in his 
 countenance, — the expression of which was both dis- 
 agreable and intelligent, that it was impossible to 
 look upon him without feeling a curiosity to become 
 acquainted with his history. — As soon as he perceived 
 that he had caught Miss Fauconb erg's eye, he re- 
 moved a few paces more distant from the House, as 
 if he was about to speak to her; but just then her 
 Mother advanced towards the window, and the mo- 
 ment he obtained a glympse of another Figure he 
 retreated to a less conspicuous situation, and walked 
 rapidly away in the direction of the Shrubbery.

 Adelaide was too much occupied with other thoughts 
 to mention this extraordinary Apparition, indeed after 
 the Stranger was gone, she scarcely recollected hav- 
 ing seen him. She returned to the Mirror to put on 
 the Jewels Lady Fauconherg wished her to wear, and 
 their brilliancy formed so strong a contrast with the 
 unnatural paleness of her own complexion^ that her 
 Ladyshij^'s maternal vanity was greatly shocked when 
 she contemplated her. 
 
 " Adelaide, my Love," said she, " I must confess 
 that your Father's Present is not at this instant so 
 becoming to you as it ought to be, — as it will be the 
 next time you appear in it. — I cannot allow you, 
 however," she continued, " to look ill to-day ; you 
 must really try the effect of a Httle rouge." 
 
 " No, Mama," replied Adelaide, firmly, " I am 
 well aware that my countenance is rather ghastly this 
 morning, but it is better that WilHam should see it in 
 its true colour, than disguised by any fictitious advan- 
 tage. — I have not concealed from him my feelings, 
 and I would not willingly deceive him in the slightest 
 particular relating to myself Had T not previously

 made known to him the exact state of my mind, I 
 would never have consented to marry him." 
 
 Before Lady Fauconberg had time to answer this 
 declaration, she was summoned to give some final 
 directions about the arrangement of the Tables for 
 the Breakfast ; and as she did not return immediately, 
 Adelaide went down stairs to her Boudoir to escape 
 from the sickening sight of the packing, and other 
 preparations for her departure. 
 
 The window of her Sitting Room, which opened 
 from the ground, was seldom unfastened by any body 
 but herself; and as she was now approaching to raise 
 it, she was considerably startled by discovering the 
 Strange looking Man she had seen before, standing- 
 close beside it. He was evidently watching for an 
 opportunity to speak to her, and as she had no incli-

 made him a sign to remove to the other window, the 
 sash of which was already thrown up. Perhaps her 
 countenance expressed a degree of alarm, for the 
 Stranger said to her,

 Fauconberg. I have indeed injured you very deeply, 
 but I am come here now for the purpose of making 
 you all the reparation that is left in my power." 
 
 Adelaide became really frightened, she imagined 
 the poor Man must be out of his mind, and as his 
 appearance besjioke extreme distress, she took out 
 her purse with the charitable intention of relieving 
 his present necessity, and the hope of persuading him 
 to go peaceably away. 
 
 He gazed on her attentively, and seemed to read 
 what was passing in her thoughts. 
 
 " I did not present myself to you," he exclaimed, 
 " with a view of asking you for money, but I am re- 
 duced to such a state of misery, that since you offer 
 it to me, I find myself unable to refuse it." 
 
 He stretched out his long bony hand to grasp the 
 liberal donation she bestowed upon him, and then 
 continued, 
 
 " You believe that I am a Lunatic because 
 I look half famished and talk incomprehensibly ; 
 But I am no Madman, though misfortunes and dis- 
 tresses brought upon me by my own wickedness and

 made me one. — Time presses, however, and I must 
 be brief. — 3Iiss Fauconberg mark attentively v^^hat I 
 am going to tell you. — ^Mr. Shirley is a Villain .'" 
 
 The tone of his voice though hollow, was impres- 
 sive, and as he pronounced the last word, it actually 
 made Adelaide shudder. 
 
 She replied instantly and with much spirit, 
 
 " I cannot suffer the Person who will in a few 
 hours become my Husband, to be mentioned disre- 
 spectfully in my presence. Your language has 
 offended me, and I must request you to leave this 
 place immediately." 
 
 " I will not go till you have heard what I have to 
 say," pursued the extraordinary Man with encreased. 
 energy. " If you refuse to Hsten to me here, I will 
 follow you to the Altar and pubUsh my news where it 
 will be more painful to you to receive it." 
 
 Adelaide was quitting the room to call some one 
 to take charge of the unfortunate person she was per- 
 suaded was unfit to be trusted to take care of himself; 
 when she heard him exclaim,

 " You little suspect how much foul play has been 
 resorted to, to bring about a Marriage that will be 
 broken off after all. The same hand that was found 
 most useful in promoting it, will now be the instru- 
 ment of marring it, and of bringing to light that 
 Colonel Henry Algernon has been basely slandered." 
 
 At the sound of that name Adelaide involuntarily 
 stopped, and the Speaker pursuing the advantage he 
 had thus gained, continued in a yet louder key, 
 
 '' I had long considered that the Colonel had been 
 my earhest and my worst Enemy, and as such I de- 
 termined that I would be revenged upon him ; but I 
 am now ready to prove that he is as innocent of the 
 Crime you have been taught to believe that he com- 
 mitted abroad, — I mean of the murder of Donna 
 
 Basilia de Lerma, his Cousin's Wife, -as you are 
 
 yourself." 
 
 There was an air of sincerity in this declaration 
 that carried conviction to Miss Fauconb erg's mind. 
 
 ''Heaven be praised!" she ejaculated, and clasping 
 her hands, forgot every thing else in her joy at hear- 
 ing Henry's character cleared from the dark stain 
 that had seemed so dreadfully to obscure it.

 A few moment's reflection, however, suggested 
 uncomfortable doubts. Henry had himself confessed 
 his guilt to her Father ; — And his exculpation rested 
 entirely upon the vague assertion of an unknown, 
 miserable Wanderer, who did not even appear to be 
 in possession of his senses. — She returned with trem- 
 bling steps to the window, and said in as calm a voice 
 as she could command, — 
 
 '' If you are in truth aware of any injustice that has 
 been done to Colonel Henry Algernon, I have still 
 so much regard for his memory, that I beseech You 
 
 to inform me of it. But do not in mercy do not 
 
 attempt to deceive me." 
 
 " Indeed poor Young Lady, I will not," replied 
 the Man, who was evidently touched by the manner 
 in which his communication had affected her. 
 
 " I will tell you the whole truth and nothing but 
 the truth, as if I was speaking upon my Oath. — But 
 had you not better sit down ? You will be faint with 
 standing." 
 
 Adelaide, who was scarcely able to support herself, 
 — immediately took this considerate hint, and draw-

 ing a chair close to the window, Hstened with breath- 
 less anxiety to the following Narration. 
 
 " I do not wish to say more than I can help about 
 myself. — I was formerly a private Soldier in one of 
 the Regiments of Guards, and while we were serving 
 in Spain I became Servant to Captain Horace Al- 
 gernon ; soon after which I unfortunately got into a 
 very bad scrape. As I was a sort of favorite with my 
 Master, I believe he would have contrived to screen 
 me, but his Cousin Captain Henry, (who was the 
 person who unluckily for me discovered my delin- 
 quency,) insisted upon my being brought to punish- 
 ment for the sake of keeping up proper discipline. 
 My character had never stood very fair with the 
 world, but I felt very much enraged at being publicly 
 disgraced. I found some consolation in retaining my 
 place in Captain Algernon's Service, which I had 
 made a pretty profitable one ; and while I paid tha 
 most assiduous attention to all his wishes, I vowed 
 secret vengeance against the author of my shame. 
 During the time this grievance was fresh in my 
 mind, my two Officers fell in love with the same

 SjDanish Lady, Donna Basilia de Lerma. She pre- 
 ferred my Master, and he was privately maiTied to 
 her. I rejoiced at this circumstance, since I hoped 
 that it would mortify his Rival ; but to my great 
 vexation, he did not appear to take it seriously to 
 heart ; Indeed much as he had admired the beautiful 
 Spaniard, I do not suppose he had ever had any inten- 
 tion of making her his Wife. 
 
 '' Captain Algernon very soon repented having done 
 so ; he grew tired of her, and began to treat her with 
 indifference and neglect. — It was then that the Devil 
 put it into my thoughts that it would be no difficult 
 matter for me to make a quarrel between ray Master 
 and his Cousin. It was not for the love of mischief 
 alone, that I wished to do this : I did not like their 
 continuing Friends, because I knew that Captain 
 Henry looked upon me with a suspicious eye, — and 
 I feared that he would persuade my Master to part 
 with me. I accordingly took an opportunity of in- 
 sinuating to the Captain, that his Relation was too 
 fond of his Lady, and that I was afraid she liked him 
 better than she ouc:ht to do in return. Her Hus-

 band, as I have said, — cared so little about her him- 
 self, that at first he paid scarcely any attention to mj' 
 hints ; but I repeated them so often that his jealousy 
 at length was roused, and it became so ungovernable 
 that he behaved with the greatest harshness towards 
 the unfortunate Donna ; upbraided her with her guilty 
 attachment for Captain Henry, and positively for- 
 bade her ever to receive any visit from him during 
 his own absence. — His Cousin did not fail to observe 
 the coldness and alteration of his manner towards 
 himself; he endeavoured to obtain an explanation of 
 this change, and to set every thing right again, — ^but 
 when he found that the Captain could not be brought 
 to hear reason, he determined to avoid giving him 
 any further cause of offence, by seeing as little of him 
 as possible. He pitied the poor Spanish Lady : He 
 knew she was devotedly attached to her English 
 Husband, and though he seldom went into her society 
 for fear of making matters worse between them, he 
 showed her every kindness in his power, and lost no 
 occasion of befriending her.

 upon the Donna the very morning after my Master 
 had ordered her never to admit him when she was 
 alone. He came to give her a Song he had copied 
 out for her at her own request, and as the Spanish 
 Servant who had been desired not to let him in, was 
 gone upon some errand, he easily found his way into 
 the House. The Lady was much distressed at his 
 appearance, but she was ashamed to tell him the truth, 
 or to beg that he would leave her ; so she welcomed 
 him as usual. I had seen him enter the door, and I 
 hastened to find the Captain and inform him of the 
 circumstance ; but wicked as I was, I very little ex- 
 pected what would be the dreadful consequence of 
 my doing so ! — 
 
 " My Master was enraged to learn that his commands 
 had been disobeyed. He instantly directed his steps 
 towards his Wife's Abode, and when he rushed into 
 her apartment he found his Cousin still with her. He 
 was teaching her to sing the Song he had brought 
 her, and at the same time accompanying her upon 
 her Guitar. The misguided Husband now believed 
 that his worst suspicions were fully confirmed ; and

 stung to fury, he drew a pistol from his bosom and 
 tshot Donna Basilia through the heart. 
 
 " Madman," exclaimed Captain Henry, as he 
 sprung from his seat and seized the Murderer by the 
 arm, " What have you done ?" — My Master made 
 no attempt to extricate himself from his Cousin's hold, 
 but stood, almost stupified, gazing upon his own sad 
 work. 
 
 " I told you that his Victim was shot through the 
 heart, hut she did not die immediately. She revived 
 for a short time, and during her last moments she 
 made such solemn and affecting protestations of her 
 constancy and innocence, that her unhappy Husband 
 was convinced that his jealousy had been quite un- 
 founded. 
 
 " As soon as I heard the report of the Pistol, I ran 
 to the room from whence it had proceeded ; and 
 hardened as I was, the sight I saw there almost froze 
 the blood within my veins. I need not describe it. — 
 But, Miss Fauconberg," said he, stopping short, " I 
 am afraid you are ill." 
 
 Adelaide assured him he was mistaken, and re-

 quested he would proceed with his Story, which he 
 did in these words. 
 
 " After my first shock was over, I regained my 
 presence of mind; and as both my Officers were per- 
 fectly distracted, I began to consider about what was 
 to be done. It was T who invented the account of 
 Donna Basiha's death, which was spread abroad and 
 currently believed. I pretended to have learnt that 
 the two Captain Algernons had been amusing them- 
 selves in the Garden belonging to her Father's House, 
 by shooting with pistols at a mark ; that while they 
 were so engaged the Spanish Lady unconsciously, 
 and unperceived by them, passed close behind the 
 Object at which they were taking aim, and unfortu- 
 nately received the contents of one of the pistols in 
 her heart. 
 
 " The violence of my Master's grief and remorse 
 brought on a brain fever ; his Cousin watched over 
 him with the attention of a Brother during his ill- 
 ness, — but after his recovery I do not think there was 
 much cordiality between them. For myself, I knew 
 that I had become odious in the Captain's eyes, but

 as I was possessed of his secret, he was obliged to 
 conceal his dislike, and to keep me in good humour. — 
 Under pretence of bettering- my condition, he soon 
 ^ot me a situation with another Officer, and dismissed 
 me with a very handsome present, from his own Ser- 
 vice. As I had grown tired of a Soldier's life, he 
 contrived to obtain my discharge as soon as my Regi- 
 ment returned to England. 
 
 " This is the correct detail of Donna Basilia de 
 Lerma's tragical History, and if you take the trouble 
 of comparing it with the false Version you have be- 
 fore heard, I have no doubt you will discover that it 
 has been altered and misrepresented in all the most 
 material jDoints." 
 
 " It certainly has," replied Adelaide, " And I am at 
 a loss to conjecture what motive could possibly have 
 induced Don Antonio de Lerma to practise so wicked 
 a deception ? We have been basely imposed upon 
 by him^ — but I do not see how Mr. Shirley can have 
 had any thing to do with this affair." 
 
 " I came here," answered the Stranger, " to make 
 known to you that it is Mr. Shirley's concern alone ;

 the old Spaniard whose name you have just mentioned 
 was no more than a Man of Straw in the business. 
 But to explain this the better, I must go back to my 
 own circumstances. — After my discharge had left me 
 my own Master, I led a very disreputable sort of life, 
 and got into so many expenses that all my money 
 was soon gone. I applied frequently to Captain Al- 
 gernon for assistance, but at length he fairly told me 
 ' that he was grown almost as needy as myself;' and 
 as he had also quitted the Army and began to spend 
 his time entirely abroad, that resource completely 
 failed me ; and I became reduced to a state of mise- 
 rable and hopeless want. — I was then in this part of 
 the country, and I learnt from common report that 
 Captain, I should now say Colonel Henry Algernon, 
 was going to be married. I had not heard any thing 
 of him for a long time, but as I still considered that 
 he had been the cause of my first misfortunes, 1 was 
 sorry to find that he had had the good luck to gain 
 the aflfections of an amiable young Lady and a great 
 Heiress. — 
 
 " You must forc;ive me Miss Fauconberg if I lake

 the liberty of speaking to you of Yourself, and of 
 mentioning' some things which it may distress you to 
 hear named ; — since it is absolutely necessary I should 
 do so." 
 
 Adelaide desired he would not out of delicacy for 
 her feelings, suppress any thing it was expedient she 
 should know ; — yet she begged him to touch as 
 slightly as possible upon the circumstances connected 
 with her former Engagement to Colonel Henry Al- 
 gernon. And he thus proceeded with his explana- 
 tion : — 
 
 " It was whispered in the neighbourhood that Mr. 
 Shirley had much wished to rival the Colonel ; and an 
 accidental occurrence convinced me that this was true. 
 A wild scheme immediately flashed across my brain ; 
 I fancied it might not be impracticable for me at 
 once to remove my own insufferable pecuniary dis- 
 tress, and to gratify my spite against a Person I hated; 
 by offering for a large sum of money to put Mr. Shir- 
 ley in possession of a Secret which would enable him 
 to break off Colonel Algfernon's marriasfe. 
 
 " I had certainly hoped when I presented nnself

 ADELAIDE. 2-21 
 
 before him, that he would find the temptation I held 
 out to him, too strong to be resisted ; Yet I despised 
 him most heartily %Yhen he consented to avail himself 
 of my assistance, and agreed to my terms." 
 
 An indescribable expression of contempt and horror 
 was visible in Adelaide's countenance, and an excla- 
 mation burst from her lips ; but the Stranger affect- 
 ing not to have noticed either, — continued speaking. 
 
 " I told him the Story I have just related to you, 
 and suggested that with a little management it would 
 not be difficult to mislead Sir Georo^e Fauconbero: 
 and his Family, and make them beheve that the dark 
 crime which rested upon the head of one of the Cou- 
 sins had been perpetrated by the other. I assured 
 him that he might gain much but could lose nothing, 
 by attempting such a stratagem; — for if it did not 
 succeed, it was impossible He could ever be suspected 
 of having had a hand in it. I declared that in case 
 of its failure, I would only demand the half of my 
 stipulated reward ; and I gave up to him the written 
 Song which had been the immediate cause of Donna 
 Basilia's death, and also several Notes addressed to

 her by her Husband. I had secreted these Papers 
 the day she was murdered, because I thought they 
 might prove the means of extorting hush money from 
 Colonel Algernon at some future time ; but before I 
 parted with them, I took care to make Copies of 
 them all. This precaution was fortunate, as it now 
 furnishes me with written proofs of my perfect ac- 
 quaintance with the facts and circumstances I have 
 stated." 
 
 Without making any pause he took a small Packet 
 from his pocket, which Adelaide did not hesitate to 
 receive.. 
 
 '' From the information I had given Mr. Shirley, 
 he made up that supposed Letter from Don Antonio 
 de Lerma which he sent to Sir George Fauconberg. 
 He did not read me its contents, but I brought it 
 myself to this House, in the disguise of a Foreigner; 
 and if I had been cross questioned, I was well enough 
 prepared with answers. You must best know what 
 effect this communication produced. 
 
 " After I had performed my errand, I was of course 
 extremely anxious to learn what would be the success

 ADELAIDE. 2*23 
 
 of our contrivance ; but for fear of exciting suspicion, 
 I kept out of sight all the rest of the day. Very 
 early the next morning, I ventured, in another dress, 
 — to approach Fauconberg Manor ; and while I was 
 cautiously reconnoitreing my ground, I was suddenly 
 overjoyed by seeing Colonel Henry Algernon ride 
 through the Park with the speed of a Run-Away and 
 the looks of a Madman. — I hastened to Greyfield 
 that I might be the first person to convey this good 
 news to my Confederate ; and the following week he 
 paid into my hands the full reward of my treachery. 
 
 '' Mr. Shirley had accomplished the object of his 
 wishes, but in so doing he had put himself completely 
 into my power ; and I believe the recollection of the 
 base and dishonourable transaction which had given 
 me this advantage over him, was particularly galling 
 to his pride. 
 
 " My former distresses had not taught me to be 
 prudent, I squandered away my ill-gotten wealth with 
 such thouofhtless extra vasrance, that it was not Ion of 
 before I found myself as pennyless as I had been he- 
 fore. I appealed to Mr. Shirley for fi'esh supplies.

 224 ADELAIDE. 
 
 which he granted me indeed, but with a very sparing- 
 hand. He offered, if I liked to seek my fortune 
 abroad, — to send me out at his own expence to North 
 America, or to any of the Colonies, as a Free Settler; 
 but I declined this, because I knew he only wanted 
 to drive me from the Country, and rid himself for 
 life of a troublesome and dangerous Neighbour. 
 
 " As my demands grew more clamourous, his an- 
 swers to them became more reluctant, till at last I 
 threatened that if he refused to attend to my wants, I 
 w^ould go to Sir George Fauconberg and expose his 
 villiany and my own. He dared not drive me to' des- 
 jDcration, so he was obliged to resort to conciliatory 
 measures for the present. — I had got leagued with 
 several of the leading Radicals in these parts, and I 
 have little doubt Mr. Shirley encouraged me to enter 
 yet deeper into their wild and ambitious plans, with 
 a hope that I might go too far, — involve myself in 
 some treasonable plot, — and be hanged for my pains. 
 
 '' I was at length taken up and thrown into prison 
 on suspicion of having been concerned in seditious and 
 unlawful practices ; and thus he was for some time 
 relieved from my importunity.

 " When I got out of Gaol, which was only two days 
 ago ; I heard that Mr. Shirley was going to be mar- 
 ried, and also that his wedding day was fixed. I 
 thought matters had been arranged somewhat hastilv^, 
 but this did not in the least surprise me, as I knew 
 he had more than one good reason to wish the cere- 
 mony to take place as speedily as possible. I posted 
 to Gi'eyfield expecting to find him in very good hu- 
 mour, and well inclined to be liberal; but on my 
 arrival, I was informed he was just gone to Faucon- 
 berg; I followed him there, and had the mortifica- 
 tion of being told he had returned home the day be- 
 fore. — It was plain that he had made a premeditated 
 resolution to avoid me, but I detennined to circum- 
 vent him. I had found it was useless to attempt to 
 see him at his Father's House ; so weary as I was, 
 and almost exhausted with hunger and bodily fatigue, 
 I sometimes tracked his steps with the eagerness of a 
 Blood Hound after his prey, and at others I watched 
 for him with the patience of a Sentinel upon duty. — It 
 was not until yesterday evening, that I succeeded in 
 meeting him. He cut the congratulations with which

 I accosted him, extremely short. I pleaded my 
 wretchedness, and described the sufferings I had en- 
 dured in prison ; and when I told him I had been ill, 
 I am sure that my looks bore sufficient testimony to 
 the truth of my statement. He said ' he was very 
 sorry for me, but that I had brought my misfortunes 
 upon myself: — ^that I ought to have kept out of mis- 
 chief.' He declared ' he was just then too much 
 occupied with his own concerns to have leisure to 
 attend to mine ;' but he added that ' if I would come 
 to him at Charlton some day next week, he might 
 then be at liberty to see what could be done for me.' 
 
 "' There is nothing that can prevent your having 
 time now^'' exclaimed I, in no very respectful tone, 
 " to put your hand into your pocket and bestow upon 
 me a few shillings to buy me a morsel of bread ; 1 
 have scarcely tasted food since I came out of prison, 
 and if I am not relieved directly, there will be no use 
 in relieving me at all. — I shall have perished from 
 want and hunger long before another week is over !" 
 " Instead of being moved to pity by this remon- 
 strance, he called up a Servant of his Father's who

 happened to pass near us, — and desiring him ' to turn 
 away the troublesome Beggar,' as he termed me, 
 he left me to my fate. The Man was not so hard- 
 hearted as his Young Master; he was touched with 
 compassion at my deplorable appearance, and before 
 he obeyed the cruel order he had received, he chari- 
 tably brought me a supply of bread and cheese, and 
 a refreshing draught of Ale. 
 
 " My indignation against Mr. Shirley was outrage- 
 ous, but not more so than his conduct towards me 
 deserved that it should be. 
 
 ' Because he has obtained every object of his own 
 wishes,' thought I to myself, ' it is brutal in him to 
 have no feeling for the distress of others. — The eve of 
 his Wedding is the appropriate moment he has cho- 
 sen to spurn from his door, the Man without whose 
 assistance he would never have gained the hand of his 
 future Bride, — to drive him out into the wide World 
 to die with misery and famine ! — He believes that I 
 can neither have the time or the power between this 
 and to-mon*ow morning, to reveal his treachery and 
 my own ; and perhaps after his marriage is once

 over, it is his intention to defy me. — But it is not yet 
 too late for me to revenge my injuries, and the love of 
 vengeance has always been one of my ruling Passions.' 
 
 '' My resolution w^as no sooner taken than it was 
 acted upon. My strength was much recruited by the 
 comfortable meal I had made, and before night-fall 
 I contrived to drag myself to Fauconberg. I slept, or 
 rather laid down, (for I could not sleep,) upon some 
 straw in a Barn adjoining the Stable ; and when morn- 
 ing appeared, I crawled out and took my post nearer 
 to the House. I wished to find an opportunity of 
 seeing you alone Miss Fauconberg, as I have just 
 contrived to do, and of exposing Mr. Shirley's infa- 
 mous character to 3-ourself. Had this proved impos- 
 sible, I had resolved that before the Bridal Party set 
 out for the Church, I would boldly demand an audi- 
 ence of Sir George, and make my communication to 
 him." 
 
 He paused for an instant. " My purpose is now 
 fully accomplished. I have told every thing I have 
 to tell, and if there are any questions you desire to 
 ask, I am very willing to answer them at this mo-

 ment, but I will never afterwards be induced to do 
 so. Your bounty will afford me the means of spin- 
 ning out my unhappy life a little longer, but I shall 
 not again intrude myself into your presence. I shall 
 of coui-se remove from this Neighbourhood as spee- 
 dily as my strength will permit me ; and when once 
 I have disappeared, all search after me will be in 
 vain. — It would be little less than madness upon my 
 part if I did not immediately quit a Country where 
 my name has become already associated with every 
 kind of infamy, and where it is not now even safe for 
 me to remain." 
 
 Adelaide was so overpowered by her feelings, that 
 she was unable to speak ; and her unknown Visitor, 
 after having allowe 1 her a short space for recollection, 
 retired from the window. 
 
 When he was gone, she covered her face with her 
 hands, — 
 
 " Henry," ejaculated she ; " dear Henry, as I may 
 now again be proud to call you; let me fall down 
 upon my knees and return fervent thanks to Heaven 
 that \ our hand was not stained with the blood of

 this unfortunate Spanish Lady. — Oh ! w ere you still 
 alive ! — But the Will of God be done. I have suffi- 
 cient cause for thankfulness in the truly providential 
 escape I have just made." 
 
 " Colonel Henry Algernon is not dead," said the 
 Stranger, who had overheard every word she had 
 spoken, and who now came back unexpectedly, to 
 reply to her. 
 
 Miss Fauconberg" started upon her feet ; her pale 
 face and even her brow and her throat were suffused 
 instantaneously with the brightest crimson, 
 
 " Wretched Man," she exclaimed, '' Your extra- 
 ordinary audacity has driven me almost out of my 
 senses. Dare not, I charge you on your peril, listen 
 a second time at this window ; and likewise beware 
 how you urge me to desperation by again repeating 
 an assertion which I know to he false , and which con- 
 sequently goes far to invalidate the truth of your 
 whole Narration." 
 
 " I am very sorry to have offended you. Miss Fau- 
 conberg," answered the Stranger, without, however, 
 appearing the least abashed. " The slightest enquiry

 at the War Office would convince you that when I 
 spoke last, I uttered no falsehood. — A new light has 
 broken in upon me, and I would fain ask you, if I 
 might presume to do so, what reason you have for 
 supposing Colonel Henry Algernon to be dead ?" 
 
 Adelaide felt that she should almost demean herself 
 by condescending to reply to so insolent and strange 
 a demand. Yet there was something so unaccount- 
 able about the Person who made it, and so powerfully 
 interesting in the subject it related to, that the temp- 
 tation of prolonging the discourse was in-esistible, 
 and she said, " That she could entertain no doubt of 
 Colonel Algernon's death, since she had seen it cir- 
 cumstantially announced in the Newspaper." 
 
 " He who was artful and unprincipled enough," 
 said the Stranger, " to fabricate the Letter that misled 
 you about Colonel Algernon in the first instance, was 
 most likely the Author also of any Paragi'aph in the 
 Newspaper which may have deceived you still fur- 
 ther. — Mr. Shirley's consciousness that his Rival was 
 not only alive, but actually on his way to England 
 with his Regiment, weis probably the reason that

 made him so particularly desirous to hasten on the 
 day of his marriage." 
 
 As the full tide of conviction began to rush with 
 astounding force across Adelaide's mind, she was so 
 completely overwhelmed by the violence of her emo- 
 tions, that she became unable to support herself She 
 spoke not a single syllable, she uttered no scream, but 
 lo the Stranger's great dismay she fell into a deep' 
 and deathlike swoon ! 
 
 " This is the second unhappy young Lady my 
 wicked arts have helped to murder," exclaimed he, 
 with a feeling of compassion and remorse very foreign 
 to his nature. 
 
 " Inhuman Monster that I am ! I richly deserve 
 every misery aiid punishment that can fall upon my 
 own guilty head." 
 
 He was just climbing through the window, with 
 thj intention of raising Miss Fauconberg and trying 
 to restore her to animation, when her Father and 
 Mother hastily entered the room together. /

 looking for her all over the House. During her 
 search she had met Sir George, and when she found 
 that he was equally at a loss with herself to imagine 
 where the Bride had concealed herself, they both 
 grew considerably alarmed. 
 
 The instant they opened the door of the Boudoir, 
 the mysterious Visitor darted back towards the lawn, 
 and disappeared so suddenly, that the Couple could 
 not exactly determine what was the Object they had 
 seen. 
 
 Their whole attention was immediately engrossed 
 by their Daughter, whose form was still stretched 
 upon the floor, and who lay to all appearance lifeless 
 before them ! 
 
 '' She has fainted ;" said Lady Fauconberg, in an 
 accent which seemed to imply a secret dread of the 
 possibility of something worse than she dared trust 
 herself to express or to believe. Sir George bent 
 over his Child in speechless agony ; but it was not 
 yery long before they were both relieved from their 
 most distressing apprehensions, by perceiving that 
 she began to revi\c. They hfied her from the

 ground, and having gently placed her upon the Sola, 
 they watched with intense anxiety the progress of 
 her returning- consciousness. — Her Bridal Veil had 
 been thrown back, and her first movement was to 
 take off the brilliant Jewels that had confined her 
 hair beneath it. Her Mother received them from her 
 hand, and Sir George made her a sign to do so in 
 silence. — Adelaide half raised herself upon the Sofa, 
 and looking with eager curiosity towards the window, 
 she enquired in a weak and hunied voice, 
 
 " Is that extraordinary Man still there? — I should 
 very much like you to talk to him. Papa." 
 
 " There is nobody with you now, my Love," an- 
 swered her Father, " except your Mother and me ; 
 and I am not aware that any one else has been here 
 this morning." 
 
 " Oh 3''es, there has,"' continued she, " And I have 
 a most wonderful Story to tell you. — Henry Algernon 
 was never married to a Spanish Lady ; — He was not 
 guilty of the murder of Donna Basilia de Lerma ; — 
 And he is now alive, and at this moment retin'ning 
 to England."

 The Baronet and his Lady interchanged looks of 
 sad intelligence. They imagined that Adelaide's 
 senses yet wandered, and while they avoided directly 
 contradicting any thing she advanced, — they endea- 
 voured to lead back her ideas into a connected and 
 rational train. She soon began to suspect the mistake 
 into which they had not unnaturally fallen ; and after 
 assuring them that she was in complete possession of 
 her reason, she pointed to the little Packet she had 
 received from the Stranger, — and observed that ' the 
 Papers it contained would afford a satisfactory proof 
 that the astonishing discovery that had been made to 
 her, was no dream.' She then, but not without much 
 difficulty and many interruptions, jDroceeded to give a 
 minute detail of all the circumstances of her interview 
 with her nameless and extraordinary Visitor. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg was very much inclined to con- 
 sider the Stranger as an Impostor, and to discredit 
 his whole Story. But Sir George, who had listened 
 with deep and unprejudiced attention to every word 
 that had fallen from Adelaide's lips, looked upon the 
 subject in a very different light.

 He thought he could discover strong internal evi- 
 dence of truth in the Statement which had heen made 
 to her ; and although it was possible enou'j;h that al-r 
 terations might have been introduced to give a colour 
 to some points relating to the Soldier's own concerns, 
 he felt convinced that all the material circumstances 
 respecting Colonel Henry Algernon, had been cor^ 
 rectly and faithfully described. He ran over in his 
 oWn mind every sentence of his last conversation with 
 Henry, and not one of the admissions he had then 
 made to him about the fate of the Spanish Lady, 
 tended in the slightest degree to contradict this opi- 
 nion. — Stung with remorse at the cruel injustice of 
 which he had been guilty towards one of his Daugh- 
 ter's Admirers; — And horror-stricken at discovering 
 the baseness and duplicity of the other ; — the worthy 
 Baronet at once silenced the representations his Lady 
 was beginning to make, — in the most decided and 
 authoritative manner. 
 
 " Lady Fauconberg," exclaimed he, " Let me hear 
 no more of this, let me never hear you say another 
 word in Mr. Shirley's defence. There can be no

 doubt of his having wickedly and contemptibly de- 
 ceived us. He is a degraded Wretch, who has dis- 
 honoured the name of a Gentleman ; and since you 
 are aware of his arts, your prei3ossession in his favour 
 is a perfect infatuation ; — A most extraordinary and 
 unpardonable sort of insanity. It will be a very long- 
 time before I shall be able to get over the indescri- 
 bable agony it gives me to think that if this young 
 Man's infamous character had been revealed to us a 
 single day, even a few hom*s later, — he would actually 
 have become the Husband of our beloved Adelaide !" 
 Lady Fauconberg was completely ashamed of her- 
 self; she felt that she had deserved the rebuke she 
 had just received, severe as it was; and her vexation 
 and disappointment got so entirely the better of her, 
 that she burst into a passionate flood of tears. It 
 might perhaps be rather uncharitalde to suppose that 
 grief and mortification at seeing her favorite scheme 
 thus frustrated at the very moment when she believed 
 it was upon the point of being successfully accom- 
 j)lished, was the predominant feeling in her mind. — 
 At any rate, it is impossible not to imagine that as

 soon as she became persuaded that the testimony 
 against Wilham was no longer questionable, — her 
 former partiality towards him began to give place to 
 disgust and indignation at his perfidious conduct. 
 And her conscience must surely have smote her 
 keenly when she could not help confessing to herself, 
 that had the Union taken place which she had la- 
 boured so unjustifiably to promote, it could have 
 brought nothing but misery upon her Daughter. 
 
 Sir George probably suspected what was passing 
 in her Ladyship's thoughts, for when he next addres- 
 sed her, it was in a milder and a kindlier tone. 
 
 " The morning wears on rapidly," he said, " and 
 it is high time we should consider what is to be done. 
 But in the first place we must remember that this 
 poor Child stands in great need of rest and quiet to 
 enable her to calm her spirits which have been agi- 
 tated and han*assed by no ordinary cause of excite- 
 ment. It will be a comfort to her, as well as to 
 Yourself, that you should remain together while I 
 have more active duties to perform. It must be my 
 task to break to Mr. Shirley's Family with the least

 possible delay, that Adelaide's Marriage cannot take 
 place this day. I will immediately exchange my 
 fine holiday Suit, for a more ordinary Dress, and ride 
 to meet the Party from Greyfield, who must have set 
 out by this time. It is only right and proper that 
 they should receive this unpleasant intelligence direct- 
 ly from Me ; and for many reasons it is more expe- 
 dient that I should communicate it to them by word 
 of mouth than by Letter. It is my intention to tell 
 them that my Daughter has just been taken suddenly 
 and alarmingly ill, and that although there is no 
 apprehension of danger, it is out of the question that 
 she should think of seeing any body but her Mother 
 and Myself, or of leaving her own Room at present. 
 Under these distressing circumstances, I shall de- 
 cline asking them to come on to Fauconberg ; plead 
 my impatience to return, as an excuse for shortening 
 my interview; and promise to send them further 
 accounts of the Invalid in the evening. — ^This plan 
 will give us leisure for reflection, and allow us to de- 
 liberate upon the best method of renouncing our 
 engagement altogether. You may easily imagine

 240 ADELAIDE. 
 
 that I have no desire to screen Mr. Shh'ley ; hut I 
 should certainly be very glad if I could avoid wound- 
 ing the feelings of my good Friend Sir William, and 
 spare him and his Daughters the misery of such a 
 discovery as I fear sooner or later must await them. 
 I shall mention Adelaide's illness to the Servants 
 here, before I leave the House, and desire them to 
 give notice that the marriage will consequently be 
 put off. And I shall give directions at the Lodge as 
 I pass, that all the Guests whom we had invited to 
 join us at Breakfast, are to be stopped, and informed 
 of these circumstances. — As the Dinner which was 
 provided for the Tenants and Cottagers cannot now 
 take place here, perhaps you will have the goodness 
 to order that the cheer we had prepared for them 
 may be distributed amongst the poor people, to make 
 amends for their disappointment." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg sighed deeply as she expressed 
 her approbation of all these judicious arrangements, 
 and Sir George was just leaving the room to prepare 
 to put them into execution, when Adelaide begged 
 him to stay one moment.

 " You are going," she said, " to meet Mi*. Shirley, 
 and in the present state of your feeHngs towards him 
 I cannot help dreading what may be the result of 
 such an interview. Oh, my dearest Father, remem- 
 ber that you would let down your own character if 
 you were to place yourself upon a level with a person 
 who can no longer be deemed an honourable Man. — 
 Consider how much more dignified it will be upon 
 your part to treat him with the silent contempt he de- 
 serves; than to condescend to reproach him, however 
 justly, for his treacherous and unprincipled conduct. 
 — For my sake, I earnestly implore you to abide by 
 your own generous resolution of never imparting to 
 any one the extraordinary ana disgraceful secret 
 ■which has been so opportunely made known to us ; 
 since it cannot be revealed without involving the in- 
 nocent in the punishment of the guilty, and drawing- 
 down unmerited shame and distress upon all his Re- 
 lations. Mr. Shirley's uneasy conscience must ren- 
 der him suspicious and apprehensive, let me therefore 
 venture to entreat that you will not betray either by 
 your countenance or manner, the alteration which

 has taken place in your sentiments regarding him.— 
 Will yon kindly promise me this ?" she added, with 
 encreasing energy, *' for I shall be perfectly mise- 
 rable until my mind is set at rest upon a point which 
 may affect me in so many ways." 
 
 '' My noble minded and considerate Adelaide," 
 replied Sir George, " you may depend upon my dis- 
 cretion and self-command, during the embarrassing 
 interview that is immediately before me. How far, 
 with justice to You I may find myself able to comply 
 hereafter with your amiable request, — must be a 
 matter of future deliberation. — In the mean time give 
 yourself no uneasiness upon the subject, as you may 
 be assured that it will be my desire and your Mo- 
 ther's, to be guided as much as possible by Your 
 wishes." 
 
 Adelaide was entirely satisfied by this kind assu- 
 rance ; and the Baronet hastened away to order his 
 Horse to be saddled, and to equip himself for his 
 unexpected ride.

 Great was the astonishment of those people who 
 were watching for the Bridal Procession, when they 
 saw Sir George Fauconberg ride forth alone and at 
 a pace which prevented all interrogations. 
 
 The tidings of Adelaide's illness, and the intelli- 
 gence that the Wedding was to be postponed, were 
 announced to all who ventured to make enquiries at 
 the House, and soon spread like wild-fire through the 
 Village. A general gloom succeeded the gaiety that 
 had illuminated every countenance a short time be- 
 fore, — and it is but justice to the Inhabitants of Fau- 
 conberg to say that they felt much more grief at 
 hearing of their Young Lady's indisposition, than at

 losing the sight of the expected show or their share 
 of the Entertainment that was to have come after- 
 wards. Mr. Shirley was too haughty and overbear- 
 ing to be popular with the lower Classes, and several 
 of the most privileged and best informed Gossips 
 observed, " that it would certainly be a great pity if 
 Miss Fauconberg was disappointed a second time ; 
 yet if the Marriage should happen to he put off alto- 
 gether, she might perhaps after all find another Hus- 
 band who would suit her quite as well as the Heir 
 of Greyfield; and be even better calculated to please 
 her own fancy. — Mr. Shirley was rich and powerful 
 to be sure, but he was not half good enough for so 
 amiable a Young Lady ; and nobody would be sorry 
 to see his pride a little humbled." 
 
 But we must take leave of such discussions to re- 
 turn to Sir George. — He had proceeded about half 
 way to Greyfield before he descried the approach of 
 the Party fi'om thence. The Bridegroom, accom- 
 panied by his Cousin William Vernon, occupied his 
 own Carriage — which now appeared for the first 
 time, and was drawn by four beautiful Horses. Sir

 William and his two Daughters followed in the Fa- 
 mily Coach ; and an open Barouche containing the 
 Upper Servants of the Establishment, concluded the 
 Cavalcade. The Relations who were to witness or 
 take a part in the Ceremony, were of course dressed 
 in a style suitable to such an occasion ; the Coach- 
 men and Footmen looked proud of their new Liveries, 
 and the Horses wanted nothing- to complete their ca- 
 parison but the handsome white satin Favours that 
 were prepared for them. In short, a gayer or a 
 better appointed Procession, had seldom been wit- 
 nessed upon a similar Celebration. 
 
 Both the Cousins had noticed that a Horseman 
 was advancing' towards them, but Mr. Shirley was 
 the first who recognised him. 
 
 " Good God 1" exclaimed he, turning as pale as 
 death, " what can have happened ? It is Sir George 
 Fauconberg." 
 
 The Baronet who had now come close up to them, 
 called to the Postilions to stop ; and the unusual ex- 
 pression visible in his countenance, together with the 
 hurried agitation of his manner, were very little cal-

 culated to re-assure his future Son-in-Law as he leant 
 forward in the Carriage to confront him. 
 
 '' It grieves me," said Sir George, " to be the un- 
 welcome Bearer of disagreable news. I come to tell 
 you that my Daughter is seriously ill." 
 
 It is impossible to describe the effect j^roduced 
 upon Mr. Shirley by this abrupt communication. His , 
 features were almost convulsed with agony, and there 
 was a wildness in his air, that absolutely frightened 
 his Companion ; while Sir George seemed to watch 
 the anguish he had occasioned, rather with curiosity 
 than with pity. 
 
 They were soon joined by Sir William. Upon en- 
 quiring the cause of the unexpected delay, and learn- 
 ing who it was that had come to meet them, he felt 
 considerably alarmed, and desired his Servant to open 
 the door of the Carriage that he might himself ascer- 
 tani the reason of so extraordinary an interruption. 
 Seeing that Julia was in lined to follow him, he told 
 both his Daughters to remain where they were until 
 his return. 
 
 Sir George squeezed his hand very cordially, and

 addressing- himself more particularly to him than to 
 his Son, repeated, but in a tone of great kindness and 
 feehng", that " his poor Adelaide was extremely ill. — 
 Her health," he continued, " appeared to be as good 
 as usual when she got up this morning. Her Mo- 
 ther was with her while she was dressing, and her 
 toilette was completed and she had come down stairs, 
 when she was suddenly seized with a fainting fit, or 
 more properly speaking a Swoon, of such long dura- 
 tion that we began to apprehend she would never re- 
 cover from it. We were at length inexpressibly 
 rejoiced by perceiving that she revived; but the 
 attack has reduced her to so weak and exhausted a 
 state, that it is perfectly necessary she should be kept 
 quiet, and I do not think she will even be able to get 
 up again to-day. The instant I could leave my Child 
 with any degree of comfort, I set out to intercept you 
 upon your road, and prevent you hearing an incorrect 
 or exaggerated account of our distress from any other 
 source. 
 
 " Circumstanced as we now are, I cannot follow my 
 natural inclination ol' asking you all to accompany me

 to Fauconberg", where I am of course anxious to get 
 back as speedily as I can. I trust there is nothing in 
 Adelaide's illness that need occasion the least future 
 apprehension ; present uneasiness it is impossible not 
 to feel. I will not fail to send you an account of her 
 this evening, and by that time I shall be capable of 
 forming a much better judgement of her case than I 
 can do now." 
 
 Mr. Shirley listened to this recital with the most 
 intense interest ; his looks varied strangely several 
 times daring its progress, but towards its conclusion 
 he seemed to be considerably relieved. He earnestly 
 l)etitioned to be allowed to return home with Sir 
 George, a request that was civilly yet firmly declined. 
 " I could not permit you to see Adelaide," con- 
 cluded the Baronet, " even if I found her much bet- 
 ter ; since such an interview would I am sure agitate 
 her spirits, and inevitably retard her recovery." 
 
 Mr. Shirley submitted to this decision without 
 making any further attempt to carry his point. Sir 
 William, who had expressed his own feelings very 
 strongly, sincerely compassionated the still severer

 ADELAIDE. 249 
 
 disappointment of his Son; but as he told him ' he 
 hoped it would be of very short duration, he con- 
 curred with Sir George in judging that it would not 
 be desirable for him to proceed to Fauconberg'.' 
 
 " We will not detain our good Friend longer," said 
 he, " for I plainly see that he is as unhappy and as 
 impatient to get away from us, as I should be if I 
 were in his place. I will desire the Servants to turn 
 the Horses' heads homewards, and trust that it will 
 not be many days before we shall retrace our steps 
 upon this road with far lighter hearts than any of us 
 can boast at present." 
 
 Sir George's reply was comprised in a very few 
 words, but he looked extremely grateful for the kind 
 consideration which released him from a painful in- 
 terview. 
 
 When the Miss Shirleys were left alone together, 
 Emily's anxiety upon her Friend's account was so 
 great that she felt almost unable to speak ; but Julia, 
 who Avas not much accustomed to keep her thoughts 
 to herself, exclaimed, after a moment's reflection, 
 
 " I shall be very considerably mistaken if we do

 not find that we have all come out upon a Fool's er- 
 rand this fine morning. — I suspect that Adelaide's 
 aversion for her Marriage has proved stronger than 
 her desire to oblige her Parents, and that she has at 
 last become refractory." 
 
 '' Such an idea, appears to me very improbable ;" 
 answered Emily. " I think it is much more likely 
 that poor Adelaide's health may have given way. 
 She has looked extremely ill lately." 
 
 " It always was my opinion," continued Julia, who 
 was rather piqued by the tone of her Sister's reply, — 
 " that she acted erroneously in accepting William, 
 when it was evident she could not endure him. But 
 if she has now refused to fulfil her engjaofement after 
 having permitted him to lead her almost to the foot 
 of the Altar, I shall not scruple to say that she has 
 used him most shamefidly." 
 
 " At any rate it will be charitable," observed 
 Emily, meekly, " not to condemn our dear Ade- 
 laide's conduct before we have heard her accused of 
 having been guilty of any offence." 
 
 The conversation ended here; but Julia endea-

 voured to watch what was passing near her Brother's 
 Carriage. She could discover little to satisfy her cu- 
 riosity, from the view she thus obtained; but when 
 she saw Sir George Fauconberg ride away, and her 
 Father turn to rejoin her Sister and herself, — she 
 could not help remarking aloud, " That their sus- 
 j^ense would now be very quickly terminated." 
 
 Emily was much more grieved than surprised by 
 hearing the explanation Sir William gave them. 
 Julia was half sorry and half incredulous^, but she did 
 not dare to express her doubts upon the subject of 
 Adelaide's illness before her Father. 
 
 William Vernon was left to the free indulgence 
 of his own thoughts, for he had a silent Companion 
 during the drive back to Grey field. Mr. Shirley 
 remained plunged in a gloomy sort of reverie ; the 
 violence of his feelings seemed entirely subdued, but 
 he sat with his face averted, as if he was afraid that 
 his Cousin might read in his countenance what was 
 passing in his mind. In short, all the party who had 
 come out so gay and joyful, turned back again morti- 
 fied, crest-fallen, and melancholy.

 When Sir Georg-e Faucoiiberg arrived at home, 
 he learnt from his Lady that she had sent for their 
 Friend the Physician, partly as a measure of precau- 
 tion, and partly as a confirmation of the report they 
 had circulated about Adelaide's health. 
 
 " It is highly necessary," she observed, " to keep 
 up appearances to the world. It is a sad pity that the 
 discovery we have made was not communicated to us a 
 little sooner, — for our breaking off the marriage now 
 must look most extraordinary ! — ^I cannot imagine 
 what all our Friends will think of us !" 
 
 " Instead of regretting," replied Sir George, " that 
 we were not enlightened earlier, let us rejoice that 
 our eyes have been opened before we precipitated 
 ourselves down the precipice upon the very verge of 
 which we were unconsciously standing. — To prove to 
 you, however, that I am not less desirous than you 
 can be, to retain the good opinion of my Neighbours, 
 I am anxious to request your assistance in devising 
 some plausible Story that may serve as an explana- 
 tion of a proceeding, the real secret of which it is 
 impossible to publish.

 " Towards the Shirley's themselves we have a very 
 difficult and delicate part to act, since we must con- 
 trive to exlricate Adelaide from her Engagement, 
 without exposing the infamous behaviour of her affi- 
 anced Husband, or throwing any unjust appearance 
 of blame upon her own conduct. When I saw Sir 
 William just now, and marked the kindness of his 
 manner, I determined that he should never learn from 
 me the details of a transaction that I am sure would 
 go near to break his heart. — It is not my purpose to 
 charge even the Culprit with his perfidy; for if I did 
 so, he would certainly deny having had any concern 
 in writing the Letter, and declare that I had merely 
 imputed it to him as an excuse for my Daughter's 
 having broken her faith. I have not a single proof 
 to bring forward in support of my accusation ; and I 
 do not so much as know the name of the miserable 
 Vagabond who gave us the information which could 
 alone have enabled me to make it. — Indeed all the 
 circumstances connected with this history are so 
 strange and improbable, that Mr. Shirley would most 
 likel3- succeed in making out a fair case to the world;

 and there can be little doubt that he would contrive 
 to convince his own Family of his innocence. 
 
 " There is another consideration, too, which has 
 great weight in inclining me to use all possible cir- 
 cumspection. The fate of Donna Basilia de Lerma 
 is a secret of much importance to all Colonel Alger- 
 non's nearest Relations. He has suffered deeply him- 
 self from his anxiety to conceal it, and I have done 
 him far too much injustice already to wish to injure 
 him yet more deeply, by becoming instrumental in 
 betraying his Cousin's misfortune. All these reflec- 
 tions induce me to think of pursuing a middle course, 
 Avhich you well know is not in general the sort of line 
 best suited to my character or inclination, but I must 
 now be contented to accommodate myself to circum- 
 stances. 
 
 "I shall tell both Sir WiUiam Shirley and his 
 Son to-morrow, that I have discovered the cause of 
 Adelaide's indisposition. That it was occasioned by 
 her having unexpectedly heard this morning from an 
 anonymous source, that a Report respecting Colonel 
 Henry Algernon, — the belief of which was the sole rea-

 soil that obliged me to put an end to her Engagement 
 with him, — was entirely unfomided ; and also that 
 she was equally mistaken in thinking that he had died 
 in the West Indies. — I shall likewise infonn them 
 that this intelligence had not affected her health 
 alone ; it had wrought such a powerful revolution in 
 all her feelings, that she had declared to me her ina- 
 bility to fulfil a Contract which no earthly considera- 
 tion could have induced her to enter into, had she 
 been undeceived sooner. — Sir William is too indul- 
 gent a Fath.r himself to require me to exert my au- 
 thority to force my Daughter to complete an Union 
 which the alteration in her sentiments towards ano- 
 ther Person, has now rendered decidedly repugnant 
 to her inclination. — Should Mr. Shirley prove refrac- 
 tory, I can find means to bring him to reason, and to 
 insinuate that I do not look upon him as the injured 
 party in this distressing and unfortunate business." 
 
 Lady Fauconberg could make no objection to the 
 plan thus laid before her for her approval ; and Sir 
 George invited her to accompany him to Adelaide's 
 room, that he might tell her what had already passed 
 between the Shirley's and himself, and communicate

 to her all that he intended to say to them at their 
 next meeting. 
 
 He found his Daughter apparently in a state of 
 greater agitation than he had left her, and there was 
 a restless eagerness in her eye, and a hunied wild- 
 ness in her manner of speaking, which he did not at 
 all like. He was still with her, when her Maid came 
 to inform them that Dr. Seebright, (the Physician,) 
 was arrived. Adelaide was aware of his having been 
 sent for, and Sir George immediately went down 
 stairs to have some conversation with him before he 
 saw his Patient. The unreserved Nature of his former 
 communications, made his present task a very easy 
 one; but when the worthy Doctor rejoined him after 
 having visited Miss Fauconuerg, he was much startled 
 by the unusually serious expression of his countenance. 
 
 " I am most anxious to spare you all unnecessary 
 alarm, Sir George," said Dr. Seebright, when he was 
 closely and eagerly interrogated by the Baronet ; 
 " But I think it is my duty to tell you that your 
 Daughter's health has been more seriously injured 
 than you imagine, by the unexpected shock which 
 her nerves have received. Her pulse runs very high.

 and there is a good deal of fever and restlessness about 
 her. I have prescribed some composing Medicines, 
 but as I cannot judge of their efficacy for several 
 hours, it will be expedient for me to remain here all 
 night. I have accordingly ordered my Servant to 
 take home my Carriage." 
 
 Sir George was thunderstruck by this announcement, 
 and it was fortunate for him that he had so kind and 
 so able a Comforter in his distress as Dr. Seebright. 
 Adelaide's bodily strength had been so completely 
 worn out by the severe mental anxiety she had suf- 
 fered for many- weeks, that the excitement occasioned 
 by the wonderful discovery that had been made to 
 her, proved greater than she was able to bear. Her 
 horror at Mr. Shirley's baseness, and her gratitude 
 for her own escape, were in themselves overwhelming, 
 — but these were as nothing in comparison to her joy 
 and happiness at being assured that Henry Alger- 
 non's character was blameless, and that the report of 
 his death was untrue. 
 
 It is said that people sometimes suffer more acutely 
 from their surprise and satisfaction at learning that a

 beloved Friend, whom they had mourned as in the 
 grave, is still alive, — than they did at first hearing of 
 his supposed loss. Certain it is, that our poor Heroine 
 who had supported the most painful extreme of grief 
 with unshaken firmness, now found herself totally un- 
 equal to sustain the sudden and extraordinary happi- 
 ness which had burst upon her. The revulsion was 
 too much for her, her ideas became confused, and 
 before morning she was in a violent brain fever. 
 
 The account of Adelaide''s health which had been 
 despatched to Greyfield the previous evening, was so 
 alarming that Mr. Shirley could not be restrained 
 from riding over to Fauconberg at a very early hour. 
 The Bulletin he received from the Servants there, 
 distressed him extremely, and he sent to Sir George 
 to beg that he would have the kindness to see him if 
 it was only for a few moments. The Baronet felt 
 little inclination to comply with a request which it 
 was impossible for him to refuse ; and when he en- 
 tered the room where his Guest was waiting for him, 
 he had some difficulty in conceahng the disgust and 
 aversion with which he regarded him.

 "" I am deeply grieved," said Mr. Shirley, " to 
 learn that Adelaide is so much worse." 
 
 " My Daughter," replied Sir George in a faltering 
 voice, ^' is indeed in a state of great danger, yet I trust in 
 God she may still be spared to us. — Dr. Seebright does 
 not, he assures me, consider her case a hopeless one." 
 
 The afflicted Father sat down as he concluded these 
 words, and shaded his face with his hand to hide his 
 agitation. — His Companion was also much affected. 
 At length Sir George, who seemed to have some- 
 thing to say, but to find difficulty in speaking, — 
 continued, 
 
 " I am willing to beheve that there may be less 
 reason for apprehension, from our having been able 
 to ascertain the cause of my poor Child's illness. — 
 You probably recollect that her Engagement to Co- 
 lonel Henry Algernon was abruptly, and I fancy it 
 was generally thought very unaccountably, broken 
 off. I do not even now consider myself at liberty to 
 explain to you that mystery, but there can be no 
 harm in my confidentially mentioning that a misun- 
 derstanding about a Report highly prejudicial to the

 Colonel's private character, — was the occasion of our 
 disagreement. He went Abroad, and a short time ago 
 I saw an announcement of his death in the News- 
 paper. I need not tell you that Adelaide had been 
 much attached to him^ yet after what had passed she 
 could scarcely allow herself to regret his supposed 
 loss ; and she imagined that Your happiness and her 
 own might be promoted by her accepting your prof- 
 fered Alliance." 
 
 " I have already heard Adelaide herself describe 
 her former sentiments for Colonel Algernon," ob- 
 served Mr. Shirley, who at all times hated the very 
 Name of his Rival, and who now began to feel some 
 very uncomfortable forebodings, and to wonder what 
 this long Preface was going to lead to ? 
 
 Sir George, without appearing to notice his inter- 
 ruption, proceeded with the eclaircissement he had 
 undertaken. 
 
 '•' It seems that when my Daughter was alone yes- 
 terday morning, she received a mysterious communi- 
 cation which informed her that the Rumour of Colonel 
 Algernon's death had been totally unfounded, and

 ADELAIDE. 261 
 
 likewise convinced her that the Report injurious to 
 his character, (which I just now alluded to,) had 
 been a distorted History, adroitly made up for the 
 purpose of deceiving her." 
 
 " The doubly treacherous Villain Woodgate, has 
 betrayed me," exclaimed INIr. Shirley, completely 
 thrown off his guard. " I can prove to you that there 
 is not the slightest rehance to be placed upon one 
 word he may have said. He hates me because I re- 
 fused to screen him from justice, and support him in his 
 career of profligate extravagance; and in order to be 
 revenged upon me for these offences, he has invented 
 an atrocious calumny which I really might have 
 hoped would not so easily have found belief in this 
 House." 
 
 Sir George's eye was keenly fixed upon him while 
 he spoke, and his looks seemed to say, ' I am obliged 
 to you for a declaration which has removed the possi- 
 bility of my ever entertaining a doubt of your guilt.' 
 He restrained his feelings, however, and put Mr. 
 Shirley more entirely to confusion by quietly asking 
 Ijim • what he meant, and who he was talking about ?'

 than he would have done by the severest expressions 
 of scorn and indionalion. 
 
 o 
 
 " I thought, — ^I understood, — " stammered the self- 
 convicted CuljDrit, " that you had mentioned Thomas 
 Woodgate ; an infamous Rascal who has just made 
 his escape from Gaol. That you had insinuated some- 
 thing about his having been here, — about his having 
 made some accusation against me. 'Tis strange why 
 that Man should have haunted my imagination at this 
 moment ! — You must excuse me Sir George ; my 
 mind is so agonized and distracted by Adelaide's 
 illness, that I am quite incapable of speaking like a 
 rational Creature, or of being aware of what I may 
 have uttered in my phrensy." 
 
 " I have indeed made every allowance for you," 
 replied the Baronet. — " As for the Person who ap- 
 pears very justly the object of your scorn and aver- 
 sion, 1 never even heard his name until I now heard 
 it from your own lips ; and from the slight description 
 you have given of him, I assure you I do not feel the 
 least desire to learn more of a character so utterly 
 worthless and degraded. To return therefore to my

 original subject, — it was my intention to have told 
 you that when my Daughter discovered Colonel Al- 
 gernon was still alive, — and far from being unworthy 
 of her affection, was all that she had formerly be- 
 lieved him ; she felt that it was impossible she could 
 ever conscientiously become the Wife of any other 
 Person. — As her health did not permit her to see you 
 herself, she commissioned me to make known to you 
 her decision to this effect, and likewise to express her 
 very sincere regret at having allowed herself to be 
 prevailed upon to give you a promise of her faith, 
 which the present alteration in her circumstances and 
 feelings, persuades her she is now more than justified 
 in retracting." 
 
 '" And does Miss Fauconberg imagine," exclaimed 
 ]Mr. Shirley, " I can relinquish hopes that are far 
 dearer to me than my existence, — that have been 
 confirmed to me by a solemn engagement, — without 
 attempting even an effort at remonstrance ?" 
 
 " I am extremely sorry," said Sir George, " that the 
 prospect of our connection should have terminated in 
 tlic manner it has done ; but as all remonstrance upon

 your part would be perfectly unavailing, let me re- 
 quest that our conversation may end here. It would 
 grieve me if we were to separate with feelings of 
 enmity towards each other. At such an hour as this 
 I should be truly unchristian if I dared to cherish 
 resentment against any body. INIy only Child is 
 labouring under a dangerous malady, — is jDcrhaps 
 now upon her death bed ; — I can entertain no doubt 
 that her illness was occasioned by the discovery that 
 was made to her yesterday morning, yet I strive to 
 forgive in my heart the unknown Author of the an- 
 guish I endure, and to consider that he is even more 
 an Object of pity than myself." 
 
 Mr. Shirley had risen to depart, but at the conclu- 
 sion of this affecting and pathetic Address, he threw 
 himself back into his chair, beat his forehead violently 
 with his clenched hands, and sobbed aloud in an 
 agony of grief, shame, and remorse. 
 
 Whatever might have been the Baronet's senti- 
 ments concerning his Companion's conduct, he could 
 not witness without compassionating this paroxysm 
 of distress.

 " Calm yourself, Mr. Shirley," said he in a tone of 
 kindness ; '' I have already expressed my hope that 
 Adelaide will recover; but under all circumstances 
 it is our duty to bear with firmness the trials and 
 afflictions that may fall to our share, instead of giving 
 way to such useless, I might almost say unmanly, 
 transports as you are now indulging. You shall hear 
 constantly how my Daughter is going on, and when I 
 am happy enough to be able to report that the fever 
 has taken a favorable turn, I will ride over to Grey- 
 field, and repeat to Sir William the explanation I 
 have just entered into with You. In the mean time, 
 farewell. I trust our next meeting will be a less 
 painful one to us both." 
 
 Mr. Shirley felt that his sentence was decisive; but 
 the ambiguous manner in which Sir George had ex- 
 pressed himself, left him in uncertainty regarding the 
 footing upon which they were to remain in future,— 
 and made it doubtful and difficult to divine exactly how 
 much of his secret, his Accomplice had thought pro- 
 per to divulge. It would be neither easy or desirable 
 to describe the dreadful state of mind in which he

 arrived at home. Adelaide's danger formed a suffi- 
 cient excuse to his Father and his Sisters for the 
 wildness of his appearance, and also for his shutting 
 himself up in his own room during the rest of the day. 
 He had little inclination to describe the reception he 
 had met with at Fauconberg ; and the society of his 
 Family, far from being likely to afford him consola- 
 tion, was, in his present situation, a penance he was 
 unable to endure.

 Thomas Woodgate was the only Child of a re- 
 spectable Farmer, who ha\dng' begun the world with 
 little or nothing, had realized a comfortable fortune 
 by honest industry. The Son was naturally an ill 
 disposed Boy, and while the mistaken indulgence of 
 his Parents prevented their correcting his faults, it 
 also induced them to encourage him in extravagance 
 and foil}' very unsuitable to bis station and circum-

 Stances. It was their ambition " to make a Gentle- 
 man of him," they determined to spare no exjDence in 
 his education, and they sent him to the best school in 
 that i3art of the Country ; but he was far from turning 
 this advantage to good account. His Master's re- 
 ports of him were always unsatisfactory, and he came 
 home confirmed in conceit and self-importance. He 
 scorned the drudgery of applying to any trade ; and 
 although his thoughtless expenditure threatened very 
 soon to exhaust the finances of the Family, he pre- 
 ferred leading a life of discreditable idleness to endea- 
 vouring to assist his Father in his labours, and trying 
 to improve his condition, and to render himself as re- 
 spectable as He had done. 
 
 The old Man discovered, when it w^as too late, the 
 mistake he had made in wishing to raise his Son 
 above the situation to which he was born. 
 
 His Wife, fortunately for herself, died about that 
 time ; and he had the misery and mortification of 
 seeing Thomas grow every day more and more disre- 
 putable ; and of perceiving that of all his hard-earned 
 savings, there would barely be enough left to support

 him in his decUning age. His remonstrances only 
 exasperated his unnatural Son. He became weary 
 of hearing them, and as the prospect of poverty began 
 to stare him in the face, he turned his thoughts to 
 seeking his fortune in some distant Countiy. 
 
 He had been spending what he called a ' merry 
 day,' Avitli several of his profligate Companions, and 
 was returning home in a very social mood, when he 
 fell in with a recruiting Sergeant of the Guards. 
 
 The Man persuaded him to accompany him to a 
 PubHc House ; he had always had a fancy for a Mili- 
 tary life, and had even at one period entertained an 
 idea of entering the army as an Officer. That view 
 had long vanished from his imagination, but he still 
 considered that there could be no disofrace to him in 
 being a Soldier, — that he should look to great advan- 
 tage in a Uniform ; — ^The temptation held out to him 
 was powerful, — his reason was confused, — he Hstened 
 eagerly to the promises and representations of his 
 new Friend, — and the next morning he informed his 
 Father that lie had been regularly enlisted in the 
 Guards.

 This intelligence completed the measure of the 
 poor Farmer's misfortunes. The thought of Thomas's 
 becoming a private Soldier, — in time of v/ar too, — 
 was such a termination of all the sanguine hopes he 
 had once formed for him, — as he had never anticipa- 
 ted. He earnestly besought him to give up this w^ild 
 plan, and allow him to purchase his discharge ; but 
 his Son turned a deaf ear to all his arguments and 
 entreaties. He was impatient to enter upon his new 
 Career, and likewise to escape from the taunts and 
 the ridicule expressed by his Friends at the step he 
 had taken. He therefore joined his Regiment as 
 speedily as possible, and was very soon afterwards 
 sent with it to the Peninsular. 
 
 The history of his proceedings while he was abroad, 
 has been already detailed in his own Narrative. 
 
 When he returned to England his Father was 
 still alive, and with his support, and the help of the 
 money he had himself become possessed of, he might 
 have been enabled to establish himself creditably at 
 home. But the unsettled habits he had acquired, 
 rendered him more averse than ever to undertake any

 permanent employment. He dazzled his original 
 Associates by his encreased extravagance, and asto- 
 nished them by boasting of the resources he could 
 command ; the period of his triumph was however of 
 short duration. His money was spent, his resources 
 had failed ; and the death of his Father, and the sale 
 of his remaining property, which immediately fol- 
 lowed that event ; destroyed the last hope of pecu- 
 niary relief which he had to depend upon. 
 
 The Village in which Woodgate had been born 
 and brought up, was not above thirty miles from Fau- 
 conberg Manor, and just when he was beginning to 
 experience pretty keenly the pangs of want, — he 
 heard that his old acquaintance Colonel Henry Alger- 
 non was going to be married to a very rich Heiress, 
 He knew well enough the sort of estimation in which 
 the Colonel held his character, but distress had ren- 
 dered him desperate ; and he determined to resort to 
 the humiliating expedient of applying to his former 
 Enemy for assistance in his difficulties. 
 
 He was aware that Henry's disposition was natu- 
 rally generous, and he thought that in the height of

 his own happiness and prosperity, he would not find 
 in his heart to refuse to bestow a small portion of his 
 wealth even upon so worthless an Object as himself, if 
 he could persuade him that he really stood in urgent 
 need of it. 
 
 As Woodgate had many reasons for disliking to 
 present himself at the House at Fauconberg, and 
 publicly requesting to see Colonel Algernon ; he took 
 up his quarters at a Village in the Neighbourhood, 
 and determined to watch for an opjDortunity of meet- 
 ing him, and speaking to him in private. 
 
 He found much greater difficulty in accomplishing 
 this purpose than he had anticipated, for Henry very 
 seldom either rode or walked out alone. He had 
 tracked him and Adelaide very closely, during their 
 sketching excursion, upon that memorable morning 
 when Sir George and Lady Fauconberg had gone to 
 announce their Marriage at Greyfield; and having 
 at length become convinced that his chance of obtain- 
 ing the desired interview that day, was quite hopeless, 
 he was slowly returning to his lodging — vexed and 
 mortified with his disappointment, — when a Horse- 
 man passed him at fuU gallop.

 It is needless to say that this was Mr. Shirley, who 
 had just been driven almost to madness by his unex- 
 pected meeting with Adelaide and her Lover. He 
 continued to urge forward his Steed at a furious pace, 
 without considering the inequalities of the ground he 
 had to pass over ; and in descending a Httle stony 
 Hill, the Animal lost its footing, fell upon its head, 
 and precipitated its Rider against a Gate. 
 
 Woodgate had recognised Mr. Shirley, whom he 
 had seen at the Election at Oldthorpe ; he had like- 
 wise heard something about his admiration for Miss 
 Fauconberg, and as he had no doubt he must have 
 met her and Colonel Algernon, he conjectured that 
 such an interview might have been the cause of his 
 extraordinary speed, and of the wildness which was 
 so visible in his whole appearance. He was still so 
 near him Avhen his Horse fell, that he distinctly wit- 
 nessed the accident, and he ran immediately to his 
 assistance. 
 
 Mr. Shirley was completely stunned by the vio- 
 lence with which he had been thrown to the ground, 
 and as Woodgate endtavoured to ascertain the extent

 of the injury heliad received, it occurred to him that 
 if it did not prove to be very serious, he might con- 
 trive to turn it to his own account. His hatred for 
 Colonel Algernon had been revived by the fruitless 
 trouble he had given himself in following him ; the 
 success that might attend an appeal to him was un- 
 certain ; — and it now flashed across his mind that he 
 might take a much readier and more profitable course 
 by proposing to sell the fatal secret he was possessed 
 of, to Mr. Shirley, than by condescending to demand 
 the charity of his Rival ; and he had picked up suffi- 
 cient knowledge of the general character of the 
 Member for Oldthorpe, to suspect that he would not 
 decline entering into such a Negociation. — All this 
 was the consideration of a moment. When the dis- 
 mounted Cavalier first came to himself, he did not 
 seem to understand where he was, or what had hap- 
 pened to him. Woodgate, who was still bending 
 over him, and watching him attentively, expressed a 
 ' hope that he did not feel much hurt.' 
 
 '' I believe I have sprained my arm," said Mr. 
 Shirley, attempting to raise it : — Tlien looking with

 son.e curiosity at the person who had addressed him, 
 he added, 
 
 '' I thank you much for the kind assistance you have 
 afforded me." And in a lower voice he muttered, — 
 
 " But I should have been far more obliged to you 
 if you had allowed me to break my neck." 
 
 He turned to look at his Horse, v^^hich was fastened 
 by the bridle to the Gate, and which did not appear 
 much the better for its fall than himself. 
 
 " Mr. Shirley," observed his Companion, " I wish 
 to have a little conversation with you before we part." 
 
 William was surprised at finding himself so well 
 known to the Stranger. 
 
 " I am not aware," he replied, '' Who it is that I 
 am sjieaking to, but at this instant it would ill be- 
 come me to refuse any request you may be inclined 
 to make. I trust what you have to say to me will not 
 occupy much time, for I have been so long absent 
 from Greyfield, that I am extremely impatient to 
 arrive there." 
 
 ■"' The business I am about to mention, concerns 
 yourself," answered Woodgate, assuming that pecu-

 liar expression of intelligence which never failed to 
 rivet the attention of those to whom he wished to 
 make any interesting communication. " It is in my 
 power to render you a Service^ — but I must be hand- 
 somely rewarded for it." 
 
 '' You have already aided me," observed Mr. Shir- 
 ley, '' in a manner which I am very ready to recom- 
 pense with a more solid acknowledgement than empty 
 thanks. But you must really tell me explicitly what 
 it is you desire of me, for I cannot understand your 
 insinuations ; and I am perfectly unable to imagine 
 any future service you may have the ability or the 
 inclination to perform for me." 
 
 Woodgate's pride had been humbled, but not ex- 
 tinguished, and he was much piqued by the haughti- 
 ness of Mr. Shirley's behaviour towards him. 
 
 " You shall hear my offer without delay," said he 
 in a tone of careless insolence. " And when you 
 have done so, it will rest entirely within your own 
 option to accept or to refuse to profit by it. — Promise 
 to give me a suitable sum of money, and I will fur- 
 nish you in return with a piece of information which

 will enable you to break off Miss Fauconberg's in- 
 tended Marriage with Colonel Henry Algernon." 
 
 William started violently, and astonishment de- 
 prived him for a moment of the power of utterance. 
 
 " If I thought," exclaimed he at length, " You 
 could indeed make good your words, I would most 
 willingly bestow upon you the half of my Father's 
 Estate. — Of course you would not dare to propose to 
 me to act in any way that I should consider in the 
 slightest degree unhandsome or dishonourable." 
 
 " When I have stated to you my scheme," replied 
 Woodgate, coolly, " You will be able to judge if it 
 is consistent with your principles to adopt it. — I knew 
 both the Colonel Algernons in Spain, and I happened 
 to witness a deed of darkness committed there by 
 Colonel Horace, with which no living Creature ex- 
 cept Colonel Henry and myself ever became ac- 
 quainted. From my intimate knowdedge of all the 
 circumstances connected with this History, I have 
 little doubt that I could easily contrive to pervert it 
 in such a manner £is to transfer the guilt of one Cou- 
 sin to the account of the other ; and by so doing ruin

 Colonel Henry in Sir George Fauconberg's opinion 
 for life." 
 
 " Detestable Villain I" cried Mr. Shirley, drawing 
 back with horror and indignation. " Do you imagine 
 me base enough to be cajjable of such treachery ? — 
 Of becoming the Abettor of your wicked falsehoods ?" 
 
 " I cannot be aware what any body is capable 
 of, until I have put them to the test/' answered the 
 undaunted Woodgate. " But since I find you are so 
 much shocked at my proposal, I will never offend you 
 by mentioning it again ; I am extremely sorry I was 
 ever tempted to do so." 
 
 Then as he was walking away, he added in a sort 
 of Soliloquy, ' 
 
 '' Colonel Algernon's good fortune was always pre- 
 dominant. Perhaps he deserves his happiness ; — at 
 any rate, I shall not now be the means of disturbing 
 it." 
 
 " Stop," exclaimed Mr. Shirley, in an agony of 
 jealousy and indecision, '' I have expressed myself 
 more strongly than I intended. — I cannot consent to 
 accuse Colonel Algernon directly of any thing I know

 to be untrue, — but some middle course may perhaps 
 be devised ; I must have time to consider. — My arm 
 too beg-ins to be stiff and painful. Can you come to 
 me at Greyfield to-morrow morning ? I shall be 
 much better able to talk this matter over with you 
 then, than I am at present." 
 
 Woodgate smiled. He had began to fear that his 
 expected prey would escape him, but the moment he 
 perceived Mr. Shirley's resolution waver, he foresaw 
 that he would at last greedily swallow the bait he had 
 prepared for him. 
 
 He assisted him to mount his horse, and readily 
 promised to meet him at any place and hour he might 
 think proper to appoint: but he suggested the pro- 
 priety of the Conference being held any where rather 
 than in Sir Wilham's House, since his appearance 
 there might attract attention and curiosity. 
 
 It is unnecessary to detail the progress of that infa- 
 mous Negociation, whose effects have been already 
 described. Mr. Shudey completely succeeded in 
 blighting the fair fame of his Rival, and even in ba- 
 nishing him from his Native Country ; but he had

 Still tlie mortification of discovering tliat he was him- 
 self as far as ever from being able to make the 
 slightest impression upon Adelaide's heart. His self 
 respect was so irretrievably destroyed, that he was 
 lost to all sense of shame; and he did not consider 
 that any future action, however base, could degrade 
 his character to a lower level than it had sunk already. 
 He had gone too far in duplicity to have the power of 
 stopping where he was, and he determined to call 
 another Stratagem to his aid, and to try what result 
 might be produced by inventing and circulating a 
 Report of Colonel Henry Algernon's death. 
 
 He composed a Paragraph, announcing the sup- 
 posed event, which he took care to have properly 
 inserted in the Newspaper ; and he also contrived 
 that the Paper, which a few days afterwards contained 
 a contradiction of that false statement, put in by au- 
 thority from Lord Altamont, — should never arrive at 
 Fauconberg. As the Family there made no enquiries 
 respecting the particulars of the decease of a person 
 whose very name it was i^ainful to them to mention, 
 it was natural enough that they did not discover the

 error into which they had fallen ; — and thus a second 
 time did the treacherous falsehood imposed upon 
 them by their unprincipled Neighbour, appear hkely 
 to answer entirely to his satisfaction. 
 
 By his disgraceful compact with Woodgate, Mr. 
 Shirley found that he had brought upon himself a 
 most importunate Tormentor. His demands became 
 both constant and unreasonable, and as it was impos- 
 sible ever to content him, he often uttered very inso- 
 lent and disagreable threats. William was not much 
 afraid of his publishing their mutual secret to the 
 world ; but as he was aware of his vindictive cha- 
 racter, he could not feel quite sure that he might not, 
 if he was exasperated, make some fatal disclosure to 
 
 ' Sir George Fauconberg. He was therefore obliged 
 to stoop to conciliatory measures, which were pecu- 
 liarly galling to his haughty and overbearing Spirit. 
 Woodgate's imprisonment afforded him a tempo- 
 rary relief from his persecutions, and he was not a 
 
 i httle vexed when he heard that he had at last been 
 liberated. 
 
 He was in no humour to receive his Petitioner very

 graciously, when lie presented himself before him on 
 the day previous to that which had been fixed for his 
 Marriage. His appearance was much calculated to 
 excite compassion, and Mr. Shirley was preparing to 
 bestow upon him a small sum of money, which he 
 declared ' was all that he had it then in his power to 
 do for him :' — When Woodgate, grown desperate by 
 suffering and want, upbraided him so keenly for his 
 meanness, and used such insufferably insolent lan- 
 guage towards him, — that William lost his temper. 
 He not only refused to give him one single penny, 
 but he desired his Father's Servant to turn him away 
 from the house whenever he dared to show his face at 
 Greyfield. And Woodgate accordingly departed, 
 loudly breathing that vengeance which he did not 
 fail to execute. 
 
 As soon as he was gone, Mr. Shirley began to re- 
 pent his own imprudence in having driven so danger- 
 ous a Man to desjDair, and to apprehend what might 
 be the consequence of having thus pushed matters to 
 extremity between himself and his desperate Accom- 
 plice.

 It was too late to call him back, as he would wil- 
 lingly have done, — he flattered himself that there 
 was not time for him to prejudice him in Adelaide's 
 favour before their Union had taken place; and in 
 short he had so many occupations and arrangements 
 to attend to, that he soon forgot his unpleasant Visitor. 
 — It was not until he saw Sir Georofe Fauconberg 
 coming to meet him on his way to Church the follow- 
 ing morning, that any serious apprehension of his 
 having been betrayed by Woodgate, occurred to his 
 imagination. 
 
 After his conference with the Baronet at his own 
 House, Mr. Shirley spared no pains to ascertain what 
 had become of his former partner in guilt, with the 
 hope of being able to learn from him, exactly how 
 much he had told Sir George ; but all his endeavours 
 to trace where he had gone proved fruitless, and he 
 was at last obliged to content himself with the idea of 
 his having entirely fled the country. 
 
 To return to Adelaide, — it is merely necessary to 
 observe that she continued for more than ten days in 
 a most alarming state, and even after she had been

 pronounced out of danger, she was so extremely weak 
 and languid, that her Father and Mother were very 
 far from feeling comfortable about her. Her nerves 
 were sadly shattered, and in short her constitution had 
 received a shock, the effects of which it was evident 
 that it would not very speedily recover. — Dr. See- 
 bright recommended that she should have change of 
 air as soon as she was well enough to be moved, and 
 Sir George and Lady Fauconberg accordingly deter- 
 mined to take her to the sea side. 
 
 Mr. Shirley rode over every day to enquire after 
 Adelaide, but he never ventured to ask to see either 
 her Father or her Mother ; he was therefore conside- 
 rably startled one morning by being told that Sir 
 George had desired he might be requested to come 
 in. 
 
 " I can now have the happiness of informing 
 You," said the Baronet as he entered the room, '' that 
 my Daughter's recovery appears to be no longer 
 doubtful. I propose to have the pleasure of commu- 
 nicating this agreable news in person to Sir William 
 to-morrow, when I hope I may also find You at

 home, as I intend to take the same opportunity of re- 
 peating to your Father the substance of the last con- 
 versation I had with yourself, and I wish to do so in 
 your presence. — Have you made known to your Fa- 
 mily the altered position in which we are placed with 
 regard to each other ? " 
 
 Mr. Shirley confessed that he had not mentioned 
 the subject to them, — that he could not help cherish- 
 ing a hope that his doom might not yet prove quite 
 irreversible. 
 
 " I am sorry," replied Sir George, " to find that I 
 did not express myself so distinctly as I believed I 
 had done, when I spoke to you before. I must now 
 beg you will clearly understand that although it is my 
 desire we should always continue to consider our- 
 selves Friewc?5," the last word seemed almost to stick 
 in his throat, — " it is impossible we can ever become 
 more nearly connected. — ^There is one thing," con- 
 tinued he after a pause, " which distresses me ex- 
 tremely. Indifferent people never fail to make it 
 their business to talk about their Neisrhbour's con- 
 
 o 
 
 cerns, and I fear that those who are unacquainted

 with the circumstances of the case, will be inclined to 
 condemn Adelaide unjustly, and to look upon her as 
 a heartless Jilt. — ^Lady Fauconberg and myself are 
 very willing to take our full share of the blame, 
 (which indeed we deserve ; ) by declaring that it was 
 entirely owing* to our persuasion, that our Daughter 
 consented to accept Your proposal ; and that it is also 
 at our desire, that she has since declined to fulfil an 
 engagement which we have recently discovered would 
 be incompatible with her happiness. — ^You are well 
 aware that this statement is the real truth, though 
 not the whole truth. And should you happen to hear 
 Adelaide's conduct undeservedly censured, I trust 
 you will upon all occasions have the candour to 
 stand forward and speak in her justification." 
 
 Mr. Shirley found the greatest difficulty in com- 
 manding himself, and in restraining the rage and in- 
 dignation which for a moment agitated his whole 
 frame. 
 
 He felt the danger of provoking Sir George to 
 make an exposure which he seemed determined if 
 possible to avoid ; and he was likewise afraid of be-

 traying more than had already come to the Baronet's 
 knowledge. He therefore suppressed the bitter ex- 
 clamation that had nearly passed his lips, — and ob- 
 served in as calm a tone as he could assume, " that 
 after the manner in which he had been treated, that 
 was indeed expecting of him the extreme of gene- 
 rosity." 
 
 " I will not disappoint you," he continued, " for 
 my attachment to Miss Fauconberg has been so sin- 
 cere, that I shall take every opportunity of proving 
 my consideration for her feelings, however regardless 
 I may invariably have found her of mine.''^ 
 
 Sir George did not trust himself to make any reply ; 
 and as neither of the Gentlemen were much inchned 
 to prolong their conversation, Mr. Shirley soon took 
 his departure. 
 
 As he rode home and b?gan to take a more dispas- 
 sionate view of what had passed, he perceived it 
 would be desirable that he should prepare his Father 
 and his Sisters for the unwelcome intelligence they 
 were shortly to receive ; and that it would be a great 
 advantage to him to be the first person to tell them 
 his own story according to his own Version.

 Sir William remarked the extraordinary depression 
 of his Son's spirits, and when he kindly enquired 
 ' what made him look so melancholy, now that Ade- 
 laide was out of danger V He broke to him the fatal 
 Secret which had, he said, been for some days prey- 
 ing heavily upon his mind. 
 
 Sir William's astonishment was only equalled by 
 his anger, and he declared ' that he would not tamely 
 submit to see any Member of his Family treated so 
 shamefully.' William endeavoured to appease his 
 Father, while he expressed the deepest gratitude for 
 the warmth and kindness with which he resented his 
 disappointment. 
 
 He observed, ' that he did certainly think he 
 had a right to consider himself extremely ill used; 
 but perhaps he had made a fortunate escape in not 
 marrying a Woman who could never have returned 
 his affection. That her entire disregard for his feel- 
 ings, mortifying as it had been to him at first, was be- 
 ginning to have a salutary effect, and had already 
 done much towards curing him of his unfortunate and 
 ill-placed attachment.' He said ' he felt in perfect

 charity with Adelaide ; but of couree he should not 
 wish to see her again for some time to come, in short 
 not until he was able to meet her with indifference. 
 That he hoped no coolness would ensue between her 
 Family and his, in consequence of what had just 
 occurred ; — that quarrels between Neighbours were 
 always foolish and unpleasant, and that it was his 
 earnest desire that the inhabitants of Fauconberg 
 Manor and Greyfield, should remain as good Friends 
 as if no intermarriage had ever been in contemplation 
 between them.' 
 
 Sir William was much surprised at the extraordi- 
 nary patience with which his Son supported his 
 mortification, and at the forbearance he expressed 
 towards those from whom he had received it ; and in 
 talking the subject confidentially over with Emily, 
 he told her ' there was something in the Story that 
 he could not quite understand, — and that he was 
 much inclined to suspect that William had concealed 
 from him circumstances, — perhaps of no great im- 
 portance, but the ignorance of which might render 
 it incomprehensible'

 Julia looked very wise when she heard of the ter- 
 mination of her Brother's Matrimonial prospects ; and 
 when he was not present, she from time to time ex- 
 tolled his wonderful heroism and fortitude. 
 
 The interview between the two Baronets went off 
 rather stiffly, particularly at its commencement, but 
 there was a frankness and cordiality in the manner of 
 the one that could scarcely fail to conciliate the other. 
 Sir William observed, however, that his Neighbour 
 did not greet his Son so warmly as he had greeted 
 himself, and that WiUiam, far from resenting this 
 apparent coolness, behaved towards him in return 
 with even more than usual deference and attention. 
 
 After every thing had been explained, Sir George 
 endeavoured to divert the conversation into a more 
 agreable and less embarrassing course, by enquiring 
 after the Miss Shirleys. He said Lady Fauconberg 
 had desired him to mention that she intended to have 
 the pleasure of calling upon them as soon as she could 
 comfortably leave her Daughter. And he added that 
 Adelaide had begged him to offer them her best love, 
 and had ventured to hope that they would come over

 and see her when she was sufficiently recovered to 
 
 be allowed to receive Visitors. 
 
 The Gentlemen parted upon amicable terms, and 
 
 each of them felt much relieved when the conference 
 
 was concluded. 
 
 The Ladies of the two Families met more than once 
 before Sir George and Lady Fauconberg went to the 
 Sea, and any sentiment of anger that Julia might 
 have entertained towards Adelaide, vanished entirely 
 the instant she beheld the sad alteration that a few 
 weeks of severe illness had made in her appearance. 
 
 Ever since the distress of mind she had suffered 
 when Henry Algernon left Fauconberg, she had lost 
 her former air of health and gaiety, and even after 
 she recovered her spirits, she had continued to look 
 extremely delicate. 
 
 But now her cheek was so completely colourless, 
 she had grown so thin, and her Form altogether 
 seemed so excessively fragile, — that it was impos- 
 sible to gaze upon her without experiencing a painful 
 apprehension that she was not likely to remain very 
 long an Inhabitant of this World.

 The engaging gentleness of her manner, and the 
 almost angelic expression of her smile, rendered her 
 evident dehcacy still more affecting : — and even after 
 Emily had seen her Friend a second time, and had 
 been assured that her own anxiety about her, had 
 exaggerated all remaining cause of uneasiness, she 
 could scarcely allow herself to believe that any thing 
 short of a miracle, could ever restore her beloved 
 Adelaide to health and strength.

 The account that William Vernon had given of 
 his Mother's health when he came to Gre} field, had 
 occEisioned his Uncle much uneasiness. She had 
 never been a strong person, and latterly symptoms of 
 Consumption had manifested themselves, — which af- 
 tenvards became so alarming, that Mr. Vernon deter- 
 mined to spend the following winter in Devonshhe. 
 
 His whole Family had been collected around him ;

 Arthur had contrived to pay him a long visit; even 
 his Sailor Son had spent some time at home ; — and 
 when the Young Men were again about to be dis- 
 persed in different directions, they could not help 
 feeling" a melancholy foreboding that all the members 
 of their happy Family Party might never be re -as- 
 sembled. 
 
 As soon as Sir AVilliam Shirley heard of the judi- 
 cious plan Mr. Vernon had formed of removing his 
 Sister to a warmer climate, and ascertained from his 
 Nephew, (who had just established himself in his 
 Parsonage at Greyfield,) that Arthur was not likely 
 to obtain a second leave of absence ; — he proposed to 
 his Daughters that they should all likewise make an 
 excursion from home, and join their Relations in the 
 West of England. He said ' it would be a great plea- 
 sure to himself to be with poor Louisa, and that their 
 society might also be beneficial to the others under 
 their present circumstances.' 
 
 Emily was delighted with the idea of seeing her 
 Aunt and her Cousins, and being able to take her 
 share with the latter in their attendance upon their

 Mother, — or in any way contributing to their com- 
 fort. And if Julia did not anticipate much satisfac- 
 tion from the prospect of a reunion with persons so 
 little suited to her taste ; the variety from the com- 
 mon course of things, which a Journey to a new place, 
 promised to afford, — was extremely agreable to her. 
 
 Mr. Shirley was ready enough to approve of any 
 project of temporary absence from Greyfield, but "as 
 he had no wish," as he expressed himself, — " to add 
 one to the large number of near Relations who were 
 going to be congregated together ;" he declared his 
 intention of establishing himself in his Father's House 
 in Town whenever the removal took place. 
 
 Mrs. Vernon was deeply gratified by her Brother's 
 affectionate kindness in leaving all his concerns at 
 home, and taking so long a journey to see her. She 
 found more immediate benefit than she had expected, 
 from the change of air ; — her cough became much 
 less troublesome, her hectic colour was exchanged for 
 a more natural hue, and in short her present Abode 
 seemed to agree with her so well, that it appeared to 
 give every promise of promoting her ultimate reco- 
 very.

 She had been greatly jDleased by the joy Emily 
 had expressed at their meeting, and she was much 
 struck afterwards with the developement and cultiva- 
 tion of her mind, and the alteration that had been 
 effected in her whole character. She was not aware 
 of the attachment which had wrought this change ; 
 and she was a good deal surprised one day when she 
 was expatiating to her Brother upon the merit of his 
 favorite Daughter, and assuring him in the warmth 
 of her admiration, that Emily's attentions to herself 
 had endeared her to her as nmch as if she was her 
 own Child ; — ^by perceiving that Sir William looked 
 much emban-assed, and turned the conversation very 
 suddenly to another subject. 
 
 Mrs. Vernon began to obsei've that her Niece 
 blushed whenever Arthur's name was mentioned. 
 She recollected that when she had talked to her Son 
 of his Cousins, after his visit to Fauconberg, he had 
 always spoken of Emily in terms of the highest com- 
 mendation ; but as this was a topic he constantly en- 
 deavoured to avoid entering upon, — she had fancied 
 that although he could not help admiring his beauti- 
 ful Relation, he might not perhaps altogether like her.

## p. 31 (#45) ##############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 31 
 
 The real state of the case now burst upon her mind, 
 and while it encreased her interest and afFection for 
 Emily, it grieved her to think that any obstacle 
 should prevent the Union of two Persons so com- 
 pletely calculated to promote each other's happiness. 
 She hoped that the peace of neither had been de- 
 stroyed ; she suspected that they had not commu- 
 nicated their mutual afFection to each other ; and 
 though she felt the most ardent curiosity to know 
 exactly how far their hearts might have been en- 
 gaged, she was conscious of the impropriety of touch- 
 ing upon so dehcate a point with her Brother, and 
 the necessity of conceahng her suspicions from the 
 Parties themselves. 
 
 Sir William Shirley had made his arrangements 
 to remain in Devonshire until it was time to go to 
 i Town ; and he had requested Mr. Vernon to find a 
 House large enough to contain the two Families. 
 
 There were several People in the Neighbourhood 
 of this Abode, with whom Sir WilHam happened to 
 be acquainted, and he consequently received more 
 visits and invitations than he or his Companions were 
 at first inchned to accept.

 After Mrs. Vernon's health began materially to 
 improve, however, they w^ere very glad to join in the 
 Society thus offered to them ; but upon these occa- 
 sions, Emily always petitioned to he one of those 
 Younff Ladies who were to remain at home with the 
 Invalid ; and when her Aunt remonstrated in the 
 kindest manner against her constantly sacrificing her 
 own amusement for her sake, — she only replied, 
 
 " I trust you will not refuse me the greatest grati- 
 fication I can enjoy. I can go out at any time in 
 Tiondon or in the North, but it is not often that I can 
 have the happiness of being with You." 
 
 Julia contrived to amuse herself extremely well. 
 She found her Relations much less disagreahle to her 
 than she had formerly thought them when they were 
 at Greyfield, and her behaviour to Mrs. Vernon was 
 so respectful and even attentive, that her Aunt almost 
 fancied she had originally judged her character too 
 harshly. 
 
 The Habitation that Mr. Vernon had selected for 
 his Brother-in-Law and himself, was not above twenty 
 miles from Altamont Castle, and they heard it often

 spoken of as one of the finest Places in that part of 
 the Country. 
 
 Woodgate had been incorrect in stating to Ade- 
 laide that Colonel Henry Algernon was actually on 
 his way to England ; for Sir George Fauconberg 
 found, upon enquiry, that his Regiment was not ex- 
 pected to be sent home until the following Spring,— 
 and that he had not himself the slightest intention of 
 returning before it. — In the mean while Colonel 
 Horace Algernon had come over from Abroad under 
 the pretence of paying a visit to his Grandfather, but 
 for the real purjDose of endeavouring to persuade him 
 to assist him in his pecuniary difficulties. 
 
 He had had an unusual run of bad luck at play, 
 and his gaming debts had consequently accumulated 
 so disagreably, that he was almost driven to despera- 
 tion. He w^as aware his Mother had opened her 
 purse to him so often already, that She had no longer 
 the means left of doing so again ; and although Lord 
 Altamont received him rather coolly, and refused at 
 first to listen to the representations he attempted to 
 make to him of his embarrassments ; he soon con-

 trived to succeed in persuading him to look upon him 
 more favourably. His presence revived all the old 
 Peer's former affection for him ; he hoped that Horace 
 might at length have grown vreary of leading a dis- 
 reputable and wandering life ; and he even told him 
 that he was willing to pay all his debts, however 
 inconvenient such a measure might be, — if he w^ould 
 promise to give up his bad habits and estabhsh himself 
 permanently at home. 
 
 There was much truth in the idea that Colonel Al- 
 gernon was completely tired and disgusted vi^ith his 
 career of profligacy and exile, — ^Yet his mind was so 
 totally perverted and unsettled, that he had not the 
 resolution to abandon the evil practices he despised, 
 and to determine to pursue a better course in future. 
 He eagerly grasped at Lord Altamont's generous 
 offer ; but as he scorned to enter into an Engagement 
 which he knew full well he should not keep, he com- 
 promised the matter, and by proposing to remain in 
 England until Henry's return; — prevailed upon his 
 Grandfather to satisfy the most clamourous of his Cre- 
 ditors immediately, — under an understanding that the

 rest of the demands upon him were to be settled after- 
 wards, provided he finally made up his mind to fix his 
 abode at Altamont Castle. 
 
 Thus he became relieved from the pressure of pre- 
 sent distress; he was too improvident to care much 
 for more remote inconvenience, — and if the recollec- 
 tion of the probable recurrence of pecuniary diffi- 
 culties ever crossed his imagination, he silenced it at 
 once by reflecting that the period could not be very 
 remote when he must become possessed of all Lord 
 Altamont's extensive landed property; — and even 
 should the worthy Peer's life be extended beyond the 
 ordinary course of nature, he could look out for some 
 rich Heiress, and gain a large fortune by a more 
 expeditious path. 
 
 Colonel Algernon's return afforded a subject of 
 much conversation in the Neighbourhood of Altamont 
 Castle. 
 
 Julia Shirley often felt an inclination to take his 
 part, for no other reason than because she always 
 heard him censured by every body else. She had a 
 great curiosity to see him ; and she thought it not

 impossible that she might be able to discover from 
 him the real History of his Cousin's Quarrel with 
 Adelaide Fauconherg-, — which of all others Avas the 
 Secret she was the most desirous to learn. 
 
 None of her Companions had any wish to become 
 acquainted with a Young- Man whose character in 
 the world was so notoriously unworthy and disrepu- 
 table ; and peculiar circumstances had also given Sir 
 William a natural dislike to the idea of any Person 
 bearing the name of Algernon. 
 
 One morning when Mr. Vernon returned from his 
 ride, he told the Young Ladies that ^ he had brought 
 them an invitation to a Ball ; and that Mrs. Stanley, 
 (at whose House it was to be given,) had so very 
 kindly insisted upon seeing them a//, that he had 
 undertaken for Sir William that he would act as Cha- 
 peron to his Nieces as well as to his Daughters ; — 
 and that they must therefore prepare their Ball 
 Dresses.' 
 
 Mrs. Vernon was much pleased with this arrange- 
 ment, and entered with great kindness into the 
 satisfaction it seemed to afford to those whom it

 principally concerned. Louisa and Emily Vernon, 
 who had yet been at very few amusements of this 
 sort, were delighted at the prospect of a Dance, and 
 only regretted that their Mother's health would not 
 allow her to be of their party. 
 
 " I like the thoughts of this Ball well enough," 
 said Julia to her Cousins, when they were talking it 
 over together ; " besides the people we know already, 
 and may consequently be glad to meet, — all the 
 Quizzes in the Country will be brought out there for 
 our amusement. We may perhaps have a chance 
 too of seeing the great and terrible Lion, Colonel 
 Algernon." 
 
 " I have very little fancy for looking at Monsters 
 of any description," replied Louisa Shirley laughing, 
 " but should the one you allude to, be led forth to 
 be gazed upon in public, I conclude he has been so 
 well trained for such an exhibition, that quiet inoffen- 
 sive people like ourselves need have no cause to be 
 afraid of encountering him." 
 
 " Be afraid of meeting him ! No, — " exclaimed 
 Julia. " My only fear is that he may prove refrac-

 tory, and chuse to shun the society of civilized Men 
 and Women. — It cannot be pleasant to find Oneself 
 in the company of those by whom one happens to 
 suspect that one's character, justly or unjustly, is 
 held in abhon*ence." 
 
 The expected Evening at length arrived, and Julia 
 was not disappointed ; for as Colonel Algernon had 
 begun to tire of the dull uniformity of Altamont 
 Castle, and was far from being sorry to find an 
 opportunity of renewing his acquaintance with some 
 of his Former Friends, — ^he was very willing to obey 
 the summons he had received from Mrs. Stanley. 
 
 Since he was to come from so long a distance, he 
 was among the number of those who were invited by 
 the Hostess to stay in the House; and he heard 
 much from the Party he found there, of the beauty 
 of Miss Shirley. 
 
 It was also said, that unlike most other Young 
 Ladies, she had an objection to going out, but that 
 Mrs. Stanley thought she would be so great an orna- 
 ment to her Ball, that she had absolutely declared 
 she would upon this occasion lake no refusal.

 " She must be an odd Person," observed Horace, 
 " I always admire any body who is different from the 
 rest of the world." 
 
 " Miss Shirley is not half so extraordinary a cha- 
 racter as her Sister," replied one of his Companions, 
 " but you will so soon see them both, that you will 
 be able to judge of them for yourself." 
 
 When Sir William Shirley's name was announced, 
 Colonel Algernon's eye wandered towards the door, 
 and he certainly did not think the Daughter who was 
 leaning upon the Baronet's arm, at all less lovely 
 than he had expected. He remarked that Julia and 
 the Miss Vernons were also very pretty Girls. He 
 did not much notice either of them however, but in 
 the course of the evening he requested Mrs. Stanley 
 to present him to Emily. She happened at the mo- 
 ment to be engaged for the next dance, and as her 
 Partner just then came up to claim her, — Horace 
 lost his chance of entering into conversation with her. 
 He felt vexed and angiy, and he probably looked so;

 he accidentally caught her eye, there was an expres- 
 sion of arch intelligence in her countenance which 
 seemed to imply that she had understood what was 
 passing in his mind. He recollected having been 
 told that she was eccentric; and seating himself in 
 the place which Emily had just left, he said to her, 
 
 " I have lived so long abroad Miss Shirley, that I 
 am not sure if you may not consider that I am taking 
 an unpardonable liberty in venturing to introduce 
 myself to you. The forms of English Society are I 
 believe still different from those of the Countries I 
 have lately inhabited." 
 
 " Your conduct. Colonel Algernon," replied Julia 
 in a tone of mock severity, " has certainly not been 
 quite in conformity with our Island Customs; but the 
 breach of decorum you have committed," added she 
 with a smile, " is so trifling, that I should be a very 
 strict Person indeed, if I refused to pardon it ; — ^par- 
 ticularly after the very humble and proper apology 
 you have made for your transgression." 
 
 Horace's fancy was much struck by the tone of 
 Julia's answer, he carried on the discourse in her own

 strain, and In less than a quarter of an hour, they had 
 mutually become as much at their ease as if they had 
 been known to each other for years. 
 
 " I was at one time in the way of seeing a good 
 deal of a Cousin of Yours," remarked Julia to her 
 new Acquaintance, " and I want to ask you what has 
 become of him ?" 
 
 '' You mean my Namesake Henry Algernon I 
 suppose," said he. " He is in the West Indies, 
 pining away with love for Miss Fauconberg, as I 
 understand. — Since she will be a great Heiress, he 
 has some reason to regret that she jilted him; but I 
 really think it is not quite necessary for him to break 
 his heart about it.'' 
 
 " I never could understand," observed Julia 
 thoughtfully, why it was that that marriage was 
 broken off?" 
 
 " No cause could be assigned, I imagine," replied 
 Colonel Algernon, " but the true one. The Lady 
 had changed her mind !" 
 
 " But why did she do so ?" enquired Juha. 
 
 " That is a question," continued Horace, " You

 can scarcely expect it possible I should be able to 
 answer. — I conclude She considered it was a little 
 privilege that all Young Ladies were entitled to 
 exert. — Speaking seriously however, I assure you, 
 (as you seem much interested in the subjectj) that 
 I am not at all acquainted with Henry's secrets. I 
 probably know less about them than you do. It is a 
 very long while since we have met ; I suppose that I 
 shall see him in the Spring, when he returns to Eng- 
 land." 
 
 " I thank you much," said Julia, " for the candid 
 confession you have just made. I perceive that you 
 are perfectly ignorant of all that has happened to 
 Adelaide Fauconberg since the period when she so 
 suddenly discarded her first Admirer." 
 
 " Good God !" exclaimed Colonel Algernon, in- 
 stantly recollecting himself, " what an Idiot I have 
 been ! I now remember having heard that she was 
 afterwards engaged to your Brother, and that she be- 
 haved even more cavalierly to him than she had pre- 
 viously done to poor Henry." 
 
 " All this is very true," observed JuUa, ^' but you

 really need not look so dreadfully disconcerted. You 
 have not said any thing the least indiscree^ and it 
 could surely be no fault of Yours that Miss Faucon- 
 berg did not choose to prove more faithful to her 
 Engagements. — I see my Father and Emily coming 
 towards us, so I must go in search of my Cousins, 
 who are such Novices in the ways of the world, that 
 they might not know how to take care of themselves 
 without my kind assistance." 
 
 She looked very much as if she was inclined to 
 have added, " and during my absence you may find 
 the opportunity you seemed before so much to wish 
 for, of improving your acquaintance with Emily." 
 
 Horace had, however, been so agreably amused 
 by Julia's lively wit, her satirical remarks, and her 
 quickness at repartee, — that he had almost forgotten 
 her beautiful Sister ; and he would not allow her to 
 depart in quest of the Miss Vernons, until he had 
 made her promise that she would consider herself en- 
 gaged to dance the next Quadrille with him. 
 
 The Ball was not concluded until a very late, or 
 rather an early hour ; and during the drive home Sir

 William Shirley asked Julia who had introduced her 
 to Colonel Alsrernon ? 
 
 " Mrs. Stanley introduced him to Emily, and he 
 introduced himself to me," replied Julia. " He is a 
 remarkably entertaining-, agreable person." 
 
 " I imagined you had found him so," observed her 
 Father, very drily, " by your encouraging him to 
 talk to you the greater part of the evening. I can 
 have of course no objection to your dancing w^ith Co- 
 lonel Algernon, as w^ith any body else you may meet 
 in private society ; but I very much disapprove of 
 your attracting general attention, by flirting in the 
 sort of way you did to-night, particularly with a young 
 Man of Colonel Algernon's character." 
 
 Julia was always indignant at being found fault 
 with; and she felt peculiarly mortified at receiving 
 this rej)roof in the presence of her Cousins. She dared 
 not say one word in her own defence, but she silently 
 resolved that no admonition from Sir William, should 
 deter her from flirting to any extent, as often as she 
 might have an inclination to do so. — Her rebellious 
 Spirit took fire at the idea of her being forbidden to

 ADELAIDE. 45 
 
 talk as much as she pleased for one evening to a Part- 
 ner she found very amusing ; — because he happened 
 to be considered a Libertine. She was more than 
 half disposed to disbelieve all the Stories she had 
 heard against him : and the very circumstance of her 
 Father's having enjoined her to shun Colonel Alger- 
 non's Society, acted upon the usual perversity of her 
 disposition, and induced her to wish to become better 
 acquainted with him. 
 
 Mrs. Vernon was anxious to hear an account of the 
 Ball, and much gratified to learn that it had proved 
 so agreable. 
 
 After Sir William and Mr. Vernon had gone out 
 riding, she was still listening to the different descrip- 
 tions of it, when the conversation was interrupted by 
 the arrival of a party of Visitors. The Gentlemen 
 who were staying at Mrs. Stanley's, — and of course 
 Colonel Algernon among the number ; had come over 
 to call upon the Baronet and his Brother-in-Law, and 
 to enquire how the young Ladies were, after the fa- 
 tigues of the preceding evening ? 
 
 They staid a long while. Horace's attentions were

 pointedly and almost exclusively directed to Julia, 
 who evidently received them with much satisfaction ; 
 and her amiable young" Relations were shocked at the 
 pleasure she seemed to find in conversing with him in 
 defiance of the kind and admonitory caution that had 
 been so lately g"iven to her by her Father. 
 
 Julia Shirley was the sort of Person exactly calcu- 
 lated to captivate Colonel Algernon. She was unlike 
 any body he had ever met with before; the origi- 
 nality of her ideas and the peculiarity of her mode of 
 expressing them, amused him extremely ; and with- 
 out taking the trouble of considering very narrowly 
 the nature of his admiration for her, or the probable 
 consequences to which it might lead ; he determined 
 to see as much of her as possible. 
 
 He contrived to get himself invited to all the par- 
 ties to which he knew she had been asked. He found 
 constant pretences for delaying" his return to Alta- 
 mont Castle. And he even endeavoured, though the 
 attempt proved ineffectual ; to conciliate Sir William 
 Shirley and soften away the strong prepossession he 
 seemed to entertain against him.

 ADELAIDE. 47 
 
 Julia's vanity was much flattered by the marked 
 ' preference that Horace displayed towards her upon 
 I every occasion. She was wiUing to think him in 
 return, the most agreable Person in the world. She 
 completely shut her eyes to all his faults. — And she 
 who had scoffed at sentiment in others, and had al- 
 ways prided herself upon the invulnerable hardness 
 of her own heart, — began almost to suspect that she 
 was in so me danger of faUing in love. 
 
 Certain rumours of the supposed attraction that 
 detained her Son, had reached INIrs. Algernon ; and 
 both she and Lord Altamont were so delighted with 
 the hope of his being induced to make a respectable 
 ' Marriage, and to settle himself permanently in Eng- 
 land, that they took good care not to press him to 
 return to them, but advised him on the contrary to 
 remain where he was and amuse himself among his 
 I Friends as long as he felt inclined to do so. 
 
 Sir WilHam Shirley began to feel seriously uneasy 
 at Colonel Algernon's flirtation with his Daughter. 
 Even supposing him to be really in earnest, which he 
 was very much inclined to doubt, he could not allow

 himself for a single instant to think of the possibility 
 of consenting- to receive him as his Son-in-Law. — He 
 was much hurt at perceiving that his admonitions had 
 had no effect upon Julia. She was indeed afraid in 
 his presence, of smiling quite so graciously upon 
 Horace's attentions as she had done at first, but he 
 was well aware that she received them more kindly 
 than ever as often as he happened to he out of the 
 way. 
 
 While the Baronet was revolving? in his mind the 
 expediency of speaking to the Colonel himself upon 
 the subject which thus distressed him, he received a 
 Letter from William who had just heard the Report 
 of his Sister's intended marriage, and who appeared 
 to be excessively annoyed by it. He said, ' he hoped 
 it was entirely unfounded; but he earnestly conjured 
 his Father, if such a thing had really been in contem- 
 plation, to break it off immediatel_y ; and at all events 
 to decline all future communication with Colonel Al- 
 gernon.' He added ' that he had known him abroad, 
 and had accidentally been informed of circumstances 
 relating to his conduct and private character, which

 ADELAIDE. 49 
 
 he was not at liberty to reveal, but which justified him 
 in declaring that he had the worst possible opinion of 
 his principles.' 
 
 This communication decided Sir William to lose 
 no time in seeking an interview with Horace. He 
 rode out, without much hope, however, of finding 
 him at home ; and had scarcely proceeded half a 
 mile when he met the very Person he was in quest 
 of. The Colonel greeted him with a smile, and told 
 him he was then upon his way to call upon him. 
 
 " I am particularly glad that I have not missed 
 you," replied Sir William, " as I much wish to have 
 some conversation with you." 
 
 He then said ' that Colonel Algernon must have 
 supposed that He, as a Father, could not fail to have 
 observed his attentions to Julia; and he trusted he 
 would allow him to add that he had felt much grati- 
 fied by the admiration he had shown for her. That 
 to prevent future disappointment to either of the 
 Parties, it was in these cases always desirable to come 
 to an early understanding. And that after having 
 weighed every circumstance maturely and deliberately

 in his own mind, he had formed a determination, — 
 which he found it pecuharly painful and awkward to 
 announce to him; — of expressing a desire that an ac- 
 quaintance so recently made, might he now brought 
 to an amicable termination, — and of requesting that 
 he would discontinue his Visits to his Family.' 
 
 Horace reddened, drew himself up, and listened to 
 this announcement with evident surprise and indig- 
 nation. He restrained, however, the rage that was 
 boiling in his bosom, and it was in a bitter ironical 
 sort of tone, that he answered, 
 
 '' You are undoubtedly the best judge of what so- 
 ciety it may be most agreable to you to select, and 
 what matrimonial connections you may consider it 
 most eligible for the Miss Shirleys to form. But I 
 certainly did not expect to receive such injustice at 
 your hands, as to be condemned by you before you 
 had even heard what I had to say for myself, — or 
 more properly speaking, to be rejected before I had 
 ventured to propose. I am far from wishing to in- 
 trude my company where it is not desired; I shall 
 scrupulously obey your injunction of not again pre-

 senting myself at your door ; but since I am forbid- 
 den to have the pleasure of seeing your Daughters 
 again under your own roof, and I am to regard them 
 as Strangers when I may happen to meet them else- 
 where ; will you have the goodness to inform me if 
 my very unflattering dismissal proceeds entirely from 
 yourself, or if my visits have become unwelcome to 
 Miss Julia also ?" 
 
 Sir George replied ^ that he had not consulted his 
 Daughter upon a point which however interesting it 
 might be to her feelings, he was convinced that He 
 was much better able to decide for her own happiness 
 than she could be herself.' 
 
 " I am willing to admit that the odium of my pre- 
 sent communication," concluded he, " rests upon my 
 head alone. And I have only to beg that you will 
 consider my decision as perfectly final." 
 
 " Unquestionably I shall do so," observed Horace, 
 with a sneer. '' Farewell Sir William, it may be 
 some time before we meet again, but believe me I 
 shall not easily forget the gratitude I owe you for the 
 courteous treatment I have received from you : — and

 be assured moreover that I will not disappoint the 
 expectations which your good opinion of my character 
 may have led you to form of me." 
 
 Without waiting for any rejoinder, he turned his 
 Horse's head, and rode slowly homewards. Sir Wil- 
 liam followed him with his eye till he was out of 
 sight. He was more than half inclined to call him 
 to account for his insolence, but he recollected that 
 he had spoken under the excitement of deep mortifi- 
 cation, and he made allowance for the irritation of his 
 feelings. He was extremely relieved to have got rid 
 of the thorn which had so long tormented him, and 
 he hastened back to relate to Mrs. Vernon, (who had 
 been previously admitted into his confidence,) all the 
 particulars of his conversation with Colonel Alger- 
 non, and also to write an account of it to his Son. 
 
 As soon as his Despatch was finished, he sent for 
 Julia, and having shown her her Brother's Letter, he 
 informed her of the step he had just taken in con- 
 sequence of the warning contained in it. She first 
 grew very red, then turned deadly pale, and at last 
 burst into a violent passion of tears. Sir William

 ADELAIDE. 63 
 
 spoke very kindly to her, but she did not seem to 
 listen to him. She was equally insensible to the 
 friendly arguments of her Aunt, and the affectionate 
 consolations of her Sisters and her Cousins ; and she 
 locked herself up in her own room for the rest of the 
 day, that she might brood over her indignation, and 
 indulge her stubborn grief in solitude. 
 
 When her Father sent to her to know if she in- 
 tended to come down to dinner, she was not ashamed 
 to appear with swollen eyes ; and she seated herself 
 in sullen silence, which she seemed obstinately bent 
 upon maintaining in spite of the repeated endeavours 
 made by Emily and the Miss Vernons to draw her 
 into something like conversation. 
 
 As soon as the Servants had retired, Sir William, 
 who had lost all patience at Julia's refractory beha- 
 viour, desired her ' to return to her own apartment, 
 and to remain there until she had learnt to command 
 her unruly temper, and to conduct herself \yith more 
 becoming propriety towards her Uncle and Aunt, and 
 with more dutiful respect towards himself.' 
 
 The young Lady obeyed him without speaking a 
 word.

 In the course of the evening Mrs. Vernon, who 
 perceived that harsh measures would make no impres- 
 sion upon so obstinate a temper, but would be likely 
 rather to aggravate the evil ; determined to try what 
 could be done by other means. She took an oppor- 
 tunity of following Julia to her room, and represented 
 to her so strongly, the folly, and danger, as well as 
 the wickedness of her present behaviour to her Fa- 
 ther, that she at length persuaded her to consent to 
 make him an apology. 
 
 Through her kind mediation Sir William was pre- 
 vailed upon to grant his Daughter the forgiveness she 
 very reluctantly submitted to ask for, — ^but the recon- 
 ciliation thus effected, was not very cordial on either 
 side. 
 
 The next day Mr. Vernon, Sir William Shirley, 
 and two of the young Ladies were engaged to dine 
 at Mrs. Stanley's, where it was known that Colonel 
 Algernon had also been invited. It had been ar- 
 ranged that Julia was to have made one of this party, 
 but under present circumstances, it was of course set- 
 lied that Emily should take her place. 
 
 In the morning the two Families received a visit

## p. 55 (#69) ##############################################


 
 ADELAIDE. 56 
 
 from a young Man who was a near Neighbour and 
 intimate Friend of Mrs. Stanley's. 
 
 " I suppose I shall have the pleasure of meeting 
 some of you at dinner to-day," said he soon after his 
 arrival. " Are You to be one of Mrs, Stanley's 
 Guests, Miss Julia ?" 
 
 " No, I am going to stay at home," replied she, 
 in rather a sulky tone, and colouring slightly as she 
 spoke. " My Sister and Miss Vernon will be there." 
 
 In a few minutes the Visitor observed, 
 
 " By the way, I have just heard a piece of news 
 which may perhaps be less surprising to you, than 
 it was to me. Colonel Algernon is gone off suddenly 
 to Altamont Castle. Can you tell me the cause of 
 tliis unexpected departure ?" 
 
 The besrinnins: of this sentence had been addressed 
 to the Company in general, but the conclusion of it 
 was more particularly directed to Julia : — at least 
 she took it to herself, for she immediately answered 
 with an affectation of indifference, 
 
 " I am a very unlikely person indeed, to be in- 
 formed of the reason of Colonel Algernon's move-

 ments. You could not possibly have applied to a 
 more unfortunate authority. I did not even know 
 that he was gone.'' 
 
 Julia was aware that every Individual in the room 
 must feel curious to observe what effect the intelli- 
 gence she had just heard, would have upon her ; and 
 she struggled hard to conceal the violent emotion with 
 which she was internally agitated. She could not 
 entirely succeed ; those who knew her best, perceived 
 that her feelings were acutely mortified, — and the 
 Visitor went away puzzled, but not enlightened.

 Julia asked her Companions when they returned 
 from theu- Dinner party if they had heard any fur- 
 ther intelHgence of Colonel Algernon ? Emily re- 
 phed ' that they had not, — That he had been much 
 talked of, but that except the fact of his depai'ture, 
 nobody seemed to know any thing about him.' 
 
 Julia's enquiry had been made in a careless man- 
 ner, and she appeared perfectly satisfied with the 
 answer she received to it. Indeed her conduct the 
 following day, led her Relations to hope that a few

 58 ADELAIDE. 
 
 hours of calm reflection had brought her to a much 
 better and more amenable state of mind. Her air 
 of stubborn indignation was gone, and although she 
 still at times looked thoughtful and unhappy, she no 
 longer refused to enter into what was going on around 
 her. Occasionally she assumed even more than her 
 former gaiety, but at these moments it was evident 
 that her wild spirits were forced and unnatural. 
 
 Without affecting to notice that any thing unusual 
 had happened, Emily and her Cousins strove by every 
 means they could devise, to comfort and amuse her ; 
 but by some unaccountable perversity in her dis- 
 position, she always seemed to be rendered more 
 melancholy when they had shown her any peculiar 
 mark of kindness or affection. 
 
 A very short time before Colonel Algernon left the 
 neighbourhood, Emily Shirley had received a Letter 
 from her old Acquaintance Mrs. Sutton, informing 
 her ' that She and Miss Drake had just began a pro- 
 gress of Visits in Devonshire,' and stating ' that if it 
 would be agreable to Sir William Shirley and Mr. 
 and Mrs. Vernon to see them, and likewise perfectly

 convenient to take them in ; it would give very great 
 pleasure to her Sister and herself to spend a couple 
 of days with such valued and excellent Friends.' 
 
 Sir William did not feel much inchnation to wel- 
 come the good Ladies, but it was impossible to decline 
 their offer; and Mrs. Vernon who had known them 
 in the days of their youth, had some curiosity to meet 
 them again, since she understood that the difference 
 of age was the least alteration that had taken place in 
 them since that period. 
 
 Emily looked forward to their visit with much satis- 
 faction, because she knew that they had very lately 
 been staying at Fauconberg Manor, and that she 
 should be able to hear an accurate rejiort from them 
 of Adelaide's health. Her own Letters had described 
 it as materially improved, but she did not feel quite 
 sure that she might in this instance rely implicitly 
 upon her account of herself. 
 
 An early day was fixed for the arrival of the Guests. 
 They did not make their appearance till after the 
 Dinner Bell had rung, and they came in of course in 
 a grand fuss. The Spring of their Carriage had

 broken and delayed them upon the road ; and the 
 derang-ement caused by this accident, and their dis- 
 may at having kept their Friends waiting for them, 
 had thrown them into a ludicrous state of distress. 
 
 Julia pretended to pity them extremely, and la- 
 mented their misfortunes in a pathetic tone and with 
 a gravity of countenance, that delighted Mrs. Sutton, 
 but could not so easily impose upon Miss Drake. 
 
 Mrs. Vernon very soon contrived however to set 
 them at their ease, and before the evening was half 
 over, she had put them both into the best and happiest 
 humour, by recalling past scenes to their recollection 
 and talking to them of former times. 
 
 She was much amused with the look of curiosity 
 they had each of them at first bestowed upon her 
 Daughters, and she was very willing to give them 
 credit for sincerity, when they afterwards expressed 
 to her the approbation that had resulted from this 
 scrutiny. 
 
 " Miss Vernon is extremely like what you were at 
 her age," observed Mrs. Sutton. " And both She 
 and her Sister look as amiable as they are pretty."

## p. 61 (#75) ##############################################


 
 ADELAIDE 61 
 
 " They have a good right to be amiable by birth," 
 said Miss Drake, " and 1 will answer for their having* 
 been admirably brought up." 
 
 " It is quite a jjleasure," continued Mrs. Sutton, 
 " to see such charming, unaffected Girls. — Young 
 Ladies in these days, are so conceited, and give 
 themselves such airs, that they absolutely provoke 
 me ; — I have no patience with them !" 
 
 " I am afraid," replied Mrs. Vernon, " that gene- 
 rally speaking your censure is too just, but very 
 many exceptions to your remark are still, I am per- 
 suaded to be found." 
 
 " Oh certainly," ans^Yered Miss Drake, " there 
 are exceptions to all General Rules. For instance. 
 Miss Shirley must I fancy be a great Favorite with 
 her Relations, as she is with every body else. — Do 
 you not think her wonderfully improved since the 
 last time you were at Greyfield ?" 
 
 " Indeed I do. I was always particularly fond of 
 Emily, I found her so gentle and engaging; and I 
 felt very sure that her good sense would sooner or 
 later lead her to correct those little failings which I 
 own were formerly perceptible in her character."

 62 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " Your penetration lias been accurately verified, 
 observed Miss Drake, " for she has undoubtedly be- 
 come every thing her Friends can wish her. — 1 do 
 not know when it will be in my power to say quite 
 as much of Miss Julia." 
 
 " Julia," replied Mrs. Vernon, " is in every respect 
 a very different Person from her Sister. There is 
 much I confess in her conduct and disposition that 
 requires improvement, but I am inclined to hope 
 that she also will grow wiser when she grows older." 
 
 Miss Drake looked incredulous, but she made no 
 answer; and at this moment Emily Shirley came up 
 to her, to ask how she had left all her Friends at Fau- 
 conberg Manor, and particularly what she thought of 
 Adelaide's health ? 
 
 " Her Mother seems satisfied about her," said she, 
 " so I trust she is regaining her strength, but she 
 looks wretchedly ill poor Thing, and is altogether 
 in a miserably nervous and uncomfortable state. — ^I 
 believe she was a good deal overcome at seeing Mrs. 
 Sutton and Me. You may recollect that we happened 
 to be staying in the House when that unfortunate and 
 extraordinary rupture with Colonel Henry Algernon

 took place. All Adelaide's concerns are perfectly 
 incomprehensible, but we have known her from a 
 Child, and we are so much attached to her, that we 
 cannot bear to imagine she has- been in fault. Every 
 body does wrong sometimes, and even supposing She 
 may have done so, there is no denying that she has 
 been very severely punished for it." 
 
 " I do not pretend," replied Emily with much 
 warmth, " to be better acquainted than the rest of 
 the world, with the secret motives of Adelaide's con- 
 duct, but I am firmly convinced that if they could be 
 made known to us, we should discover that she de- 
 served to be exonerated from all blame." 
 
 INIiss Drake was much pleased with Emily's ge- 
 nerous defence of her Friend, and she proceeded to 
 give her the various messages she had brought from 
 Adelaide, and to enter into numerous details of what 
 had passed at Faucoiiberg, — all of which were more 
 or less interesting to Miss Shirley. 
 
 " Do look at Emily," said Julia to Louisa Vernon. 
 " Did you ever see any thing so delightful as her 
 devotion to Miss Drake ? It far exceeds my pathetic

 sympathy for the misfortunes of her Journey; which 
 I considered at the time as a very masterly piece of 
 acting in its way. — She really seems to devour her 
 words with as much eagerness as if she was listening 
 to an account of her absent Lover, instead of hearing 
 the particulars of the convalescence and proceedings of 
 Adelaide Fauconherg, — illustrated doubtless by sun- 
 dry tedious Annotations and Reflections." 
 
 This observation was made in an under tone, but it 
 did not escape the quick ear of Miss Drake. 
 
 Without aff^'cting to have noticed it, she went on 
 quietly saying to Emily, ' that it would not now be 
 very long before she saw the Fauconbergs again, as 
 they intended to be in Town early in the Spring ; and 
 that she rather suspected from a hint which had been 
 thrown out by Sir George, that they had some 
 thoughts of afterwards taking Adelaide to the South of 
 France, — which in Her opinion would be a most ex-

 nel Henry Algernon puts me in mind of his Cousin. 
 He was staying in the same House with us the other 
 day, and though he is certainly very handsome, and 
 may doubtless be very clever, — we were far from 
 being captivated with what we saw and heard of 
 his manners and his character. We were to have 
 met him again ; but sudden departures appear to be 
 quite the fashion in his Family. We were told he 
 had received a Summons to return to his Grandfather 
 at a moment's warning." 
 
 Julia felt that she had deserved this attack, yet it 
 galled her deeply, and her eyes flashed fire as she 
 said with a sneer, " that if Colonel Algernon was 
 tired of the society he had been living in, she thought 
 he was very wise in leaving it; and that a speedy 
 removal had spared him the pain of bidding farewell 
 to his numerous kind Friends." 
 
 Mrs. Sutton had been all this time entertaining 
 Mrs. Vernon with one of her interminable Histories. 
 After the Gentlemen came in, the conversation was 
 more general, and when the tea was taken away, Sir 
 William Shirley proposed a Rubber at Whist.

 In the course of the Evening however, Miss Drake 
 found an opportunity of asking Louisa Vernon about 
 her Brothers, and enquiring particularly where the 
 Captain was at present ? On being told that he was 
 with his Regiment, and informed where it was quar- 
 tered, she observed, 
 
 " Then you do not expect him to join your Party 
 while you are here ?" 
 
 *' Oh, no," replied Louisa. " He paid us a long 
 visit in the Autumn when we were all assembled at 
 home; and we cannot hope to have him with us 
 again for a great while." 
 
 It would be a tedious task to detail minutely the 
 occurrences and conversations of the two following 
 days. They passed agreably enough, for the Guests 
 were determined to be pleased with every thing, and 
 felt much gratified at perceiving how anxious the 
 whole party were to amuse them. They talked inces- 
 santly, related their most entertaining Anecdotes ; and 
 Sir William Shirley declared, 
 
 " He had never before seen Mrs. Sutton and Miss 
 Drake half so pleasant; that he was sure their meet

 ing with his Sister had made them fancy themselves 
 quite young" again." 
 
 Juha alone felt excessively annoyed by their pre- 
 sence. She was aware that they had heard enough 
 of her affairs to be curious to learn under what cir- 
 cumstances She and Colonel Algernon had parted. 
 She knew that they observed her narrowly ; and their 
 inquisitorial glances were peculiarly disagreable to 
 her. 
 
 The mutual dislike that existed between her and 
 Miss Drake, gave rise to a continual war of words, 
 and though neither of them wished to can-y matters 
 to extremity, or to provoke a quarrel; many very 
 cutting and unpleasant things were said by both. It 
 was therefore with the most heartfelt satisfaction that 
 Julia watched their Carriage drive away from the 
 door ; and she did not scruple to express pretty loudly 
 her unfeigned joy at their departure. Her Cousins 
 were going out riding, and she announced her inten- 
 tion of taking a long walk ' that she might enjoy 
 solitude and silence undisturbed, — which would be a 
 real luxury after having been condemned to hear

 tbe eternal monotonous gabble of Mrs. Sutton's 
 
 o 
 
 tongue ; and the still more abominable, — shrill, dis- 
 cordant tones of Miss Drake's voice, for three mortal 
 morniDgs and evenings.' 
 
 The w^ind had been very cold, and after Dinner 
 Julia complained of a bad tooth-ache. Her face 
 looked much flushed, and she said she felt altogether 
 so stupid and uncomfortable, that she proposed going 
 to bed very early. Every one expressed kind and 
 sincere concern for her suffering, and as her Father 
 affectionately wished her good night, he observed 
 " it was a pity Mrs. Sutton was gone, as She would 
 have been sure to have suggested at least fifty infal- 
 lible remedies, any of which would have been war- 
 ranted to quiet the refractory Tooth in less than 
 five minutes." 
 
 " Oh pray do not mention Mrs. Sutton and Miss 
 Drake," exclaimed Julia, " the sight of them at this 
 moment would actually kill me ! The very sound of 
 their names has given me an additional twinge of 
 pain. I hope I shall not dream of them." 
 
 The next morning Julia said that her tooth-ache

 was much better, but she looked as if she had spent 
 a restless night. The Sun was shining brightly 
 after a heavy rain, and the showers that had fallen 
 had so sensibly warmed the air ; that Mrs. Vernon 
 proposed to pay a round of distant Visits which she 
 had for some time had in contemplation. She selec- 
 ted the two Emily's as her Companions during her 
 drive ; and as Julia declared ' she should not venture 
 out of doors for fear of bringing back the pain in her 
 face;' Louisa Vernon offered to give up her pro- 
 jected ride with her Father and Sir William Shirley, 
 that she might stay at home and keep her company. 
 
 Julia thanked her Cousin for her intended kind- 
 ness, but would by no means agree to her making 
 such a sacrifice for her sake. 
 
 " She should be quite miserable," she said, " if 
 Louisa were to shut herself up in the House the whole 
 of such a beautiful day, because She happened to be 
 a prisoner. She could contrive to amuse herself very 
 well alone for a few hours. She had a number of 
 things to do, which would perhaps have remained 
 for ever undone, if so tempting an opportunity of set-

 ting about them, had not occurred. — And that it was 
 upon the whole a fortunate circumstance that She, 
 who was famed for being idle and untidy, should at 
 least upon one occasion in her life, have plenty of 
 occupation upon her hands. — As soon as you are all 
 fairly gone out," she concluded, " I shall retire to 
 my own room, and begin my grand arrangements. — 
 I am not even sure that I may not lock my door to 
 prevent the intrusion of my Maid. And when I am 
 completely fatigued with my labours, I can lie down 
 upon my bed and rest myself. I did not sleep a 
 great deal in the night." 
 
 Louisa saw that her Cousin was determined to 
 spend her morning in her own way, so she made no 
 further attempt to remain with her. The moment 
 she returned from her ride however she went up 
 stairs to look for Julia, but she did not find her in her 
 room. Upon asking the Servant if he knew where 
 she was ? She was considerably surprised by his 
 telling her that ' he believed Miss Julia was gone 
 out walking.' ' It is very strange !' thought Louisa. 
 ' But as the afternoon has been so remarkably fine,

 I suppose she has changed her mind : and flincied 
 that a little fresh air could not possibly do her any 
 harm.' 
 
 She strolled out into the Shrubbery to meet her 
 Cousin, for as that was the warmest and most shelter- 
 ed walk near the House, she imagined she had pro- 
 bably directed her steps thither ; — but she went quite 
 to the end of the Walk without seeing any traces of 
 Julia. She perceived as she repassed the Drawing 
 Room Windows, that she was not there ; the evening 
 was closing fast, and as Louisa re-entered the House, 
 she thought to herself, " she must be come in by this 
 time. She is hiding herself somewhere to escape my 
 reproaches, but I am determined to discover her re- 
 treat, and call her to account for the slippery trick 
 that she has played us all." 
 
 Within the apartment which was jointly occupied 
 by the Miss Shirleys, there was a little Dressing 
 Room, where Emily frequently retired when she 
 wished to write a Letter, or to read any thing that 
 required particular attention. It now occuned to 
 Louisa that Julia had probably entrenched herself

 72 ADELAIDE. 
 
 within this Sanctum, and she was confirmed in her 
 opinion when she found that the door was locked. 
 She recollected that her Cousin had threatened to 
 turn her key against all Intruders, and she was not 
 very much surprised by her refusing even to give any 
 answer to her entreaties for admittance. She began 
 to fancy the Servant had been mistaken in thinking 
 he had seen Julia go out walking, — and that she had 
 really been shut up all day in the retreat she had 
 chosen. She therefore resolved to make no further 
 attempt to disturb her in her mysterious occupations, 
 and went quietly to her own room to take off her 
 Riding Habit. 
 
 It was very late when the Ladies returned from 
 their drive ; and they were still giving an account of 
 their visits to Sir William and Mr. Vernon, when the 
 Miss Shirleys' Maid put her head into the room and 
 requested to speak a few words to the Baronet in 
 private. 
 
 He instantly left the Circle in which he was stand- 
 ing, and the Woman told him with much agitation, 
 
 " That she was afraid Miss Julia must be ill, or that

 ADELAIDE. 73 
 
 something must have happened to her ; — for she had 
 locked herself up in her Dressing-Room, and that she 
 could not get a single word from her, though she had 
 put her mouth close to the key-hole, and informed 
 her over and over again that it was long past dressing 
 time, and that Mrs. Vernon and the Ladies were all 
 \ come home." * 
 
 Sir William rushed up stairs. He shook the han- 
 dle of the door violently, but with no other effect than 
 to assure himself that it was fastened ! He called 
 loudly to Julia by her name, but no answer was re- 
 turned ! He desired her immediately to admit him, 
 or at least to speak to him, — if she did not intend 
 to drive him perfectly distracted ; — ^but all was still 
 silent ! Sir William turned pale, he staggered back 
 a few paces as if he was scarcely able to support him- 
 self, — and in a voice almost choaked by emotion, he 
 ordered the trembling Maid to run instantly and call 
 somebodj'^ to break open the door. 
 
 Emily observed the summons her Father had re- 
 ceived, and when she found that he did not return to 
 the Drawing-Room, she became alarmed, and deter-

 mined to follow him. His loud exclamations attracted 
 her to her own Aj^artment, and she reached it just 
 soon enough to hear the last words he had si3oken. 
 
 " This Key," said she, hastily removing one from 
 the lock she still held in her hand, " will open the 
 door of the Dressing-Room." Then starting, and 
 suddenly horror-stricken at perceiving Sir William's 
 haggard appearance, — " My dear Papa," she cried, 
 in a tone of agony, " What can be the matter with 
 you ? Something very dreadful must have taken place 1" 
 
 "• You have no cause to he frightened upon my ac- 
 count," replied the Baronet in alow and agitated voice. 
 
 '' But, my beloved Emily, you had better go down 
 stairs. It is necessary that I should open this door 
 immediately, — and I cannot, — I have not the heart 
 to do so while You are here." 
 
 Emily shook almost convulsively from head to foot, 
 yet it was in a firm tone that she answered, 
 
 " And do you think it possible that I can leave 
 you when I know that you are in such a state of 
 distress ? — No, — if any shocking calamity has indeed 
 befallen us, we will meet it together. And surely by

 SO doing" we shall be the better enabled to support it. 
 Let me turn the Key for you, I have been more ac- 
 customed to manage that lock than any one else." 
 
 "My matchless Child," exclaimed Sir William, 
 " I cannot be sufficiently thankful for the comfort and 
 support I possess in You, I feel it strongly in this 
 hour of trial ; and I am now more sensible than ever 
 1 was, that there is no affliction which your amiable 
 and dutiful affection does not possess the power to 
 mitigate." 
 
 There was indescribable anguish in the hunied and 
 apprehensive glance which both Father and Daugh- 
 ter cast around the little Dressing-Room the instant 
 the door was unclosed. And this give place to an 
 expression of astonishment and dismay, when they 
 ascertained that the Object of their anxiety had still 
 eluded their search, and that wherever Julia might 
 be, she had certainly not concealed herself there. 
 They looked at each other in silence, and seemed 
 mutually reluctant to give utterance to their fears. 
 The furniture before them was in some confusion, as 
 if it had been recently moved, and various things 
 were likewise scattered about the floor.

 " What is that you have found, my Love ?" asked 
 Sir WiUiam, who observed that Emily was very at- 
 tentively perusing a paper which she had discovered 
 upon the table. 
 
 She was quite unable to make him any reply, but 
 she put the scrawl she had just read, into his hands, 
 and throwing herself upon a chair, she burst into tears. 
 
 The Note which had so deeply affected her, was 
 an unsealed Billet written by Julia, and merely con- 
 taining the following words. 
 
 *^' I do not venture to address this communication 
 particularly, to any of my Relations. I dare not hope 
 that my Father will forgive the step I am just going 
 to take. All responsibility concerning my future 
 happiness or misery will now rest upon my own head; 
 but I trust that those who have hitherto shown me so 
 much kindness and affection, will not entirely re- 
 nounce their interest in my fate when I inform them 
 that before they hear of me again, I shall have be- 
 come the Wife of Colonel Algernon." 
 
 " Unhappy Girl," exclaimed Sir William. " She

 has rushed with misguided obstinacy upon her own 
 ruin ! A few moments ago, I trembled for her hfe, 
 and would have given worlds to be told that she was 
 well : — and now that I have received that assurance 
 from herself, it has come in such a shape, that I al- 
 most feel it would have been a blessed circumstance 
 for her, and a less distressing trial for us all, if my 
 oriofinal fears had been realized." 
 
 The report of Julia's disappearance spread rapidly 
 through the House, and Mr. and Mrs. Vernon and 
 their Daughters hastened to ascertain its truth, and 
 to offer their advice and condolence to Sir William 
 and Emily. They found them in great need of com- 
 fort and consolation, and nobody knew better than 
 they did, how to afford it. 
 
 The Baronet's first idea was to set out in immediate 
 pursuit of the Fugitives, and endeavour if possible to 
 overtake them before a Marriage could have been 
 effected ; but upon consideration, there seemed very 
 little chance of succeeding in such an attempt. They 
 must have gained a start of several hours at least. 
 There was not the slightest clue to discover in what 
 direction they had fled ; and as poor Sir William

 78 ADELAIDE. 
 
 observed, " Even if he could be fortunate enough to 
 rescue his Daughter, and bring her home again now, 
 he should have too much reason to fear that she who 
 had contrived thus cruelly to deceive him once, would 
 very soon find the means of doing so a second time." 
 He looked upon the misfortune which had fallen upon 
 him as irremediable; and though he determined to 
 submit to it as patiently as he could, he felt very 
 painfully that this would prove no easy task. 
 
 Could Julia have witnessed the bitter agony of 
 her Father's grief ; the keen, but touching and quiet 
 affliction of Emily ; and the deep distress into which 
 she had plunged her whole Family; her stubborn 
 heart must have been melted with feelings of horror 
 and remorse, and she must have shuddered at the 
 consciousness of the wicked and unnatural conduct 
 which had caused all this misery. 
 
 But she was then hurrying away from her Friends, 
 her home, and all the recollections connected with 
 both, — as speedily as four Post Horses could carry 
 her ; and her greatest anxiety arose from the fear of 
 being unable to fly fast enough to be perfectly secure 
 from all danger of being overtaken.

 When Colonel Algernon and Sir William Shirley 
 parted after their last interview, the former felt out- 
 rage ously indignant at the insulting and injurious 
 treatment he imagined he had received; and he 
 firmly resolved to revenge it in the manner which 
 would at once prove most deeply galling to the Ba- 
 ronet, and most agreable to his own inclination. 
 
 The prospect of being suddenly obliged to break 
 off his acquaintance with Juha, had convinced him

 80 ADELAIDE. 
 
 that he liked her better, — or in other words that her 
 society was more essential to his happiness, than he 
 had before suspected. He had fallen in love with her 
 the very first evening he had met her; but as he knew 
 that she had little or no fortune, and was fully aware 
 what an inconvenient incumbrance a Wife who was 
 without one, would prove to him; it is extremely 
 probable that he would never have thought seriously 
 of marrying her, if he had not been urged to do so 
 by the opposition he encountered from her Father. 
 
 '' Sir William," muttered he to himself as he rode 
 away from him, " has felt much unnecessary alarm. 
 I had no intention of requesting him to bestow upon 
 me either of his precious Daughters; but since he 
 seems to consider me unworthy of receiving such an 
 honour at his hands, the case is changed, and I shall 
 be much mistaken if I do not show him that I am 
 able to win the fair Julia's heart, and to obtain her 
 plighted faith, without asking his consent, and even 
 in direct defiance of his prohibition. — I cannot bear 
 the idea of renouncing the Daughter, and my pride 
 is piqued to humble the insolence of the Father.

 Despicable as I may be, there are people in the world 
 who would not reject with disdain, the prospect of 
 an Alliance with the Heir of the ancient House of 
 Altamont." 
 
 Leaving Horace to indulge his own reflections and 
 form his future plans, we must return to Julia who 
 has already been described as feeling sufiiciently 
 miserable, on the morning after the Scene that has 
 just been alluded to. 
 
 She had, in the most stubborn and ungracious 
 manner declined accompanying her Sister and her 
 Cousins in their walk ; but finding herself afterwards 
 too much excited to be able to remain quietly in the 
 House, she threw on her bonnet and her cloak, and 
 wandered out alone. She breathed more freely when 
 she found herself in the open air, and she hurried on- 
 ward at a rapid pace without being at all conscious in 
 what direction she was proceeding. 
 
 The intelligence of Colonel Algernon's sudden 
 departure to Altamont Castle had startled and mor- 
 tified her beyond expression. She had fondly flat- 
 tered herself that the wild and headstrong attachment 
 VOL. in. F

 8*2 ADELAIDE. 
 
 she entertained for him had at least been mutual ; 
 and she wept with mingled grief and indignation at 
 discovering how readily he had been satisfied to give 
 her up. She despised, — she condemned from the 
 bottom of her heart — the falsehood and treachery of 
 all Young Men ; — she censured — she rebelled against 
 the harshness and cruelty of all Fathers ; — she hated 
 the whole world and every thing in it; — and while 
 she looked with the greatest contempt upon her own 
 weakness, she felt how perfectly unable she was to 
 renounce and overcome it. In short she was in that 
 sort of phrensied state, when the evil passions have 
 obtained so complete and fearful an ascendancy in 
 the mind ; that their victim is disjiosed to rush head- 
 long into the most desperate schemes, and to adopt 
 the first wild suggestion that may present itself. 
 
 Julia was at length recalled to her recollection 
 by observing that her footsteps were dogged by a 
 tall, strange looking Man in a Sailor's Dress, who 
 appeared to have been watching her for some time. 
 He did not seem anxious to overtake her, but he 
 followed her at an easy measured pace, which made

 ADELAIDE. 83 
 
 it evident that he had the power to diminish the dis- 
 tance between them at any moment when he might 
 feel the inclination to do so. She became much 
 alarmed, and upon casting her eyes around her, she 
 was very disagreably surprised to find how far she 
 had rambled from home. It was gi-owing rather 
 late, the Labourers had all returned from their work, 
 and not a Creature was to be seen in the fields. 
 She dared not face the Stranger, by retracing her 
 path; and the only course that presented itself to 
 her, was to walk on to the nearest group of Cottages, 
 which she knew to be about a quarter of a mile from 
 the spot where she then was. She affected not to 
 notice the Sailor, yet she ventured from time to time 
 to reconnoitre his progress; and she thought she 
 perceived that he began to gain ground upon her. 
 She endeavoured, though imperceptibly, to quicken 
 her own steps; and she had for a httle space alto- 
 gether lost sight of him, — when in turning a sharp 
 corner of the road, she was horrified at discovering 
 that by making a short cut across a field, he had got 
 on before her, and was standing in the centre of the

 road — as if with the intention of arresting her further 
 advance. 
 
 JuHa felt that flight was impossible; her Spirit 
 was naturally daring, and though she trembled inter- 
 nally, she resolved to confront the Sailor with the 
 boldest face she could assume. His hat had been 
 drawn down over his brow to conceal his features, — 
 but he raised it as she drew near ; and in a tone that 
 thrilled to her heart, and instantly dispelled her 
 apprehensions, while it encreased her outward agi- 
 tation, — he besought her not to be alarmed at his un- 
 couth and extraordinary appearance. She fixed her 
 eyes attentively upon his countenance for a single 
 moment, to asssure herself that the figure who stood 
 before her was really Horace Algernon ; — and then 
 feeling irresistibly amused at the eflfect of the dis- 
 guise he had adopted, and still more at the ludi- 
 crously submissive attitude in which he bent towards 
 her, as suitable to the character it was his pleasure to 
 feign ; she burst into an hysterical fit of laughter. 
 
 As soon as she had sufficiently recovered her com- 
 posure to be able to speak to him, she said.

 '' You have absolutely frightened me out of my 
 wits. I had no reason to expect to see you here at 
 all, much less to meet you in this ridiculous sort of 
 masquerade. I heard that you were gone to Altamont 
 Castle." 
 
 '' I intend to go there to-morrow morning," replied 
 Horace ; and it was in an accent of rej^roach that he 
 added, 
 
 '' You surely could not imagine that I had departed 
 without making an effort to take leave of You ? — 
 After what passed yesterday between Sir William 
 Shirley and myself, of which I conclude you have

 myself openly as a Visitor at his door ; but I deter- 
 mined to endeavour to see you by stratagem. — ^I de- 
 clared to my Friends, my purpose of setting out 
 upon my journey by day -break this morning, and I 
 actually got into my Carriage, at an unusually early 
 hour; but instead of taking the direct road to my 
 Grandfather's, I drove to a secluded Village where I 
 exchanged my own clothes for the dress in which 
 you now see me. I had provided myself with this

 Disguise to avoid the danger of being recognised by 
 any of your Family I might chance to meet, and I 
 thought my appearance was so completely altered 
 by my borrowed raiment, that I ventured to approach 
 within sight of your windows without the least fear 
 that I should be known. — From ten o'clock, I pa- 
 tiently watched every avenue to your abode, with 
 the hope of being able to obtain the interview I so 
 earnestly desired ; and had I been unfortunate enough 
 to fail in achieving the Object of my wishes, I have 
 a Note now in my pocket which I would have found 
 means to convey to your hands unknown to your Re- 
 lations. — I saw your Sister and the Miss Vernons go 
 out walking without You ; and I was beginning to 
 despair of your following their example, when to my 
 inexpressible delight I perceived a solitary Figure 
 steal from the door, and pursue an opposite course to 
 the one they had previously taken. I dared not speak, 
 or make myself known to you until you were beyond 
 all reach of dangerous or impertinent observation ; 
 but I followed the direction you had taken ; and if 
 you will permit me to do so, I l)elieve I may here

 have an opportunity of opening my whole mind to 
 you without fear of interruption from any one." 
 
 The anger Julia had felt against Colonel Algernon, 
 vanished entirely, or rather gave place to encreased 
 approbation, when she learnt the proof he has thus 
 given her of his devotion. She listened with secret 
 triumph and satisfaction to the ardent declaration of 
 deep and unalterable attachment, which her encou- 
 raging reception emboldened him to pour forth: — 
 And she was even imprudent enough to confess * that 
 if her Father's cruel Mandate had not forbidden her 
 to express such sentiments, she should not perhaps 
 have been unwilling to acknowledge that the prefe- 
 rence he professed for her, was in some degree re- 
 turned.' 
 
 " And will you, dearest Julia," exclaimed Horace, 
 passionately,. '' consent tamely to sacrifice your own 
 inclination, and my future happiness, — the happiness 
 of a person who adores you ! — at the shrine of duty ? 
 Had I found you cruel, or even cold ; I must have 
 torn myself away from you and attempted to recon- 
 cile myself to my wretched fate. But since you

 allow me to flatter myself that I am not indifferent 
 to you, no earthly power shall ever induce me to 
 relinquish the hope of overcoming the barrier which 
 at present opposes itself to our union." 
 
 " Alas I" replied Julia, " What can you wish me to 
 do ? There is little chance of your being able to re- 
 move the deep-rooted prejudice my Father unfortu- 
 nately entertains against you ; and in defiance of his 
 authority, I dare not even engage to keep up any 
 further communication with you. — My Brother too, 
 it seems, has been pleased to signify his disapproba- 
 tion of my having seen so much of you lately. I am 
 not particularly obliged to William for his kind inter- 
 ference in my concerns, and I certainly do not con- 
 sider myself the least bound to be guided by his 
 counsel." 
 
 " I am almost afraid," said Horace, " to implore 
 you to be guided by mine ; yet I cannot resist the 
 temptation of endeavouring to persuade you to judge 
 and act for yourself in a matter of such vital interest 
 and importance to us both : — a question in short

 since it concerns us much more nearly than it possi- 
 bly can do any body else. Why should you not at 
 once bless me with the assurance that you will bestow 
 upon me that hand, which I should value a thousand 
 times more dearly as your own free Gift, than if I re- 
 ceived it with the sanction and approbation of all the 
 Fathers in the world ? Oh my beloved Julia," (he 
 threw himself upon his knees before her as he spoke,) 
 " if it is indeed true that you feel a warm, a sincere 
 regard for me; — if you really believe that it would 
 be in my power to render you happy ; — do not, do 
 not hesitate to promise me that you ^vill unite your 
 fate with mine. — ^You will not speak to me," he con- 
 tinued, as Julia stood silent and irresolute, almost 
 resolving to grant his request, yet half frightened at 
 the desperate step he had nearly prevailed upon her 
 to hazard. " Time steals on ; every moment is pre- 
 cious ; You may be missed, sought for ; and if we 
 are separated before you have made a final decision 
 in my favour, — I have too much reason to apprehend 
 that the arguments and influence of your Relations 
 mav persuade 30U to renounce me for ever."

 '' No;" replied Julia, quickly, " This is no season 
 for dissimulation, or I might not perhaps be inclined 
 to tell you fairly that Your eloquence is more power- 
 ful with me than that of all my Family put together, 
 — And to prove to you that it is so, I now give you 
 my solemn promise that you shall receive my Vows 
 at the Altar, in spite of my Father's prohibitions, my 
 Brother's displeasure, and the opposition of every one 
 of my ^Kindred." 
 
 Horace's professions of gratitude and devotion were 
 cut short by the necessity of terminating a conference 
 which, had it detained Julia much longer from home 
 must have awakened the suspicion of her Friends, and 
 thereby endangered the success of the scheme her 
 Admirer meditated putting very speedily into execu- 
 tion. He declared he should run no risk of detection 
 if he accompanied her to the edge of the plantation 
 that screened out the House from the view of the 
 high road, — and that his doing so would give them 
 time to discuss their future plans. 
 
 Julia agreed to the expediency of this proposal ; 
 she was in no hurry to dismiss her Companion, and

 as tlie road she had to retrace was a very solitary one, 
 she was perhaps not sorry to retain his Guardianship. 
 He toid her ' that in order to haffle the curiosity 
 of their Neighbours and elude all observation, it was 
 desirable he should adhere to his original intention of 
 returning immediately to Altamont Castle. And that 
 while he affected to consider that his acquaintance 
 with her was entirely at an end, — he would there 
 employ himself in concerting the best means of effect- 
 ing an Elopement to the Continent, where a private 
 Marriage might be performed wdth much greater ease 
 than in England.' He said ' that it would be dan- 
 gerous to trust their project to paper, he woidd there- 
 fore make no attempt to coiTespond with her ; — But 
 that when all his arrangements were settled, he 
 would try to see her again, that they might talk them 
 over together ? and that she should then receive some 
 short written communication from him, requesting 
 her to appoint the time and place at which she might be 
 able to meet him.' Finally, he conjured her to recollect 
 how much depended upon her own discretion. Ad- 
 vised her to be particularly circumspect in her beha-

 viour towards her Family, and to lead them to believe 
 she cared so little about himself, that she was satisfied 
 to conform to her Father's wishes, — and to forget him. 
 
 Julia assured him, ' that he need not be afraid of 
 her betraying their secret either by look, word, or 
 deed.' And when Horace was at length obliged to 
 bid her farewell, they separated with the cheering 
 hope that after one more interview, and at no very 
 distant period, they should meet again to be parted 
 no more. 
 
 Had Julia's Relations been aware of her clandestine 
 agreement with Colonel Algernon, they would have 
 been at no loss to account for that sudden alteration 
 in her conduct, which they had attributed to far 
 better motives. Even after the first delirium of her 
 excitement had had time to subside, she was too 
 much bUnded by her attachment, to regret the rash 
 and unjustifiable Engagement into which she had 
 allowed herself to be hurried. Yet she was not so 
 entirely unprincipled as to feel easy or comfortable 
 under the consciousness of the deceit she was prac- 
 ticing upon those who deserved a very diflTerent return

 for their kindness towards her. She became irrita- 
 ble, restless, and miserable ; and she grew extremely 
 anxious and impatient to learn from Horace when he 
 was likely to come and claim the fulfilment of her 
 promise, and relieve her from the state of disquietude 
 and self-reproach to which her undutiful behaviour 
 had reduced her. 
 
 One morning while the Miss Shirleys \yere dressing, 
 their Maid brought them a packet of printed papers 
 from a Shopkeeper in the Neighbourhood, who was 
 desirous of recommending his goods. They had been 
 left at the door by a Man who said he was employed 
 to distribute them, and were folded up in the shape 
 of Letters. 
 
 Each of the young Ladies had one of these Ad- 
 dresses separately directed to herself, and had they not 
 been sealed, it is most probable that Julia would never 
 have taken the trouble of opening hers. She glanced 
 her eye over its contents, and was not a little startled 
 at observing the following brief announcement written 
 in pencil at the bottom of the printed Form.

 " Every thing is now ready to be submitted to 
 your approbation. Please therefore to address one 
 line to A. C. to inform me when and where I may 
 have the honour of waiting upon you." 
 
 Julia's face became crimson, — she read the pre- 
 cious words over and over again that she might be 
 quite sure of their import, and also fix them in her 
 memory ; and then pretending to be angry with 
 the ShoiDkeeper, she threw the Letter into the fire, 
 exclaiming as she did so, " How can people be 
 troublesome enough to bore one with these sort of 
 applications ? It is really too abominable," 
 
 " Pray do not agitate yourself so violently upon 
 the subject," said Emily, looking at her Sister with 
 surprise. " The poor Man had no intention of offend- 
 ing us, and as we are not obliged to purchase his 
 Wares, we may at least forgive him for recommend- 
 ing them to us." 
 
 It was on the day of Mrs. Sutton's and Miss Drake's 
 expected arrival, that Julia received this curious com- 
 munication from Colonel Algernon. She lost no time

 in answering it, and she desi)atched her Letter to the 
 Post Office by a trusty Boy who was unable to read 
 its direction. She was too well aware of the inquisi- 
 tive disposition of the Visitors, and also of their acute- 
 ness and penetration, — to summon Horace to ap- 
 proach within the distance of a walk from her Father's 
 House, while they continued to be its inmates; and 
 it was this circumstance which rendered her so jje- 
 culiarly impatient that they should take their depar- 
 ture. She had heard they had another engagement 
 in the Neighbourhood, which must take them away 
 at a given period; and upon the faith of this, she 
 ventured to appoint her Lover to come again to the 
 same spot where he had met her before ; at the very 
 moment when she calculated that the good Ladies 
 would be travelling in another direction. 
 
 Their Carriage had scarcely driven from the door, 
 when, (as already mentioned,) she announced her in- 
 tention of taking a walk, and accordingly sallied forth 
 towards the place of rendezvous. Horace had arri- 
 ved there much earlier, and becoming impatient at 
 her delay, had wandered on so far that at the very en-

 trance of the Shrubbery, Juha descried the tall Figure 
 and blue Jacket which had once given her such unne- 
 cessary alarm. 
 
 She was at first startled at finding him thus close 
 to the House, but recollecting that none of her Family 
 would be the least likely to interrupt it, — she pro- 
 posed that their conference should take place in a 
 Rustic Arbour which was completely screened from 
 the view of the windows. 
 
 Horace told her that he had made all the possible 
 preparations to facilitate their flight, and that if it was 
 attempted immediately, there was not the least pro- 
 bability of its meeting with any impediment; — ^but 
 that even a short delay would be likely to derange 
 his measures, and perhaps to defeat them altogether 
 by leading to the danger of a discovery. He said 
 that his own Chaise and four, driven by Post Boys 
 who had been bribed to make good speed, — should 
 be stationed in ambuscade about a quarter of a mile 
 distant, in a retired Lane which led into the high 
 road. That relays of Horses were ordered to be in 
 readiness at every Stage until they should arrive at

 the nearest convenient point upon the Sea Coast ; 
 and that he had engaged the Master of a small 
 Trading" Vessel to cruise off the shore for the next 
 two days, and to be upon the watch at a given signal 
 to send out a Boat to take them on board, and con- 
 vey them to France. His own Servant and a tem- 
 porary Lady's Maid, who had lived with his Mother, 
 were to meet them at the place of embarkation, and 
 the Marriage Ceremony would of course be perform- 
 ed as soon as they landed upon the Continent. 
 
 Having explained all his arrangements, he con- 
 jured Julia if she did not repent her Engagement, to 
 lose no time in consenting to fulfil it : — and he im- 
 plored her to contrive, if it was practicable, to elope 
 with him that very evening. 
 
 Julia's resolution had been too firmly taken to 
 allow her to waver for an instant in her purpose, yet 
 there was something very appalling in the idea of 
 being so speedily severed from all her Family ; and 
 although she shut her eyes to the future consequences 
 of the action she meditated, she could not help feel- 
 ing, and shuddering as she did so, that she was stand-

 ing upon the brink of a Precipice from which she had 
 lost the power of retreating. To remain stationary 
 after having- rushed on so far, was equally out of the 
 question; in reply to Horace's solicitations, she there- 
 fore observed, 
 
 " That her having summoned him to a second in- 
 terview, was a sufficient proof that her sentiments and 
 her determination were unaltered ; — ^but that if she 
 made any attempt to leave home that night, her ab- 
 sence must be inevitably and immediately discovered, 
 — She could easily contrive," she added, " to steal 
 out of the House unperceived in the course of the 
 following morning, when her Father and her Com- 
 panions were dispersed in diflferent directions; and 
 her flight would not then be discovered until she was 
 U>o far distant to be very readily overtaken." 
 
 Julia's subsequent disappearance has shown how 
 successfully she accomplished her rash and uudutiful 
 project. Sir William Shirley's enquiries enabled 
 him to ascertain that a Chaise and four had been seen 
 driving at a furious rate along the road leading to- 
 wards the Coast. He traced the progress of this

 Equipage to the Sea Side, and learnt that it had 
 contained a Lady and Gentleman, who had embarked 
 on board a Vessel which appeared to have been wait- 
 ing for them. — Here of course all clue to their future 
 progress was lost ; and the first distinct tidings which 
 the unhappy Family obtained of the Fugitives, was 
 seeing in the Newspaper that '• Colonel Algernon and 
 Miss Julia Shirley had been remarried in the Ambas- 
 sador's Chapel at Paris; the Ceremony having been 
 previously performed at a small Town upon the 
 French Coast.' 
 
 When Mr. Shirley received the intelligence of his 
 Sister's Elopement, he became perfectly frantic, and 
 hm-ried into Devonshire to concert with his Father 
 the best possible means of dissolving an Union he 
 could not bear to think of, — and of taking vengeance 
 upon Colonel Algernon for the insult he had offered 
 to them all. 
 
 Sir William, and his other Relations endeavoured 
 to reconcile him to an evil that was now irremedi- 
 able ; and they flattered themselves that they had at 
 least persuaded him to relinquish all plans of open

 and declared hostility against a Person, who however 
 unworthily he had become so, was actually the Hus- 
 band of his Sister. 
 
 As soon as Horace arrived at Paris, he wrote to 
 his Mother and to Lord Altamont, to inform them of 
 his Maniage ; to request their forgiveness for having 
 taken so important a step without previously con- 
 sulting them ; and to beseech they would allow him 
 to bring his Wife to Altamont Castle, as he was ex- 
 tremely anxious to make her known to her new Rela- 
 tions. 
 
 Mrs. Algernon never thought that any thing her Son 
 did, could be wrong ; and as he was not in the habit 
 of asking her advice, she was neither surprised or 
 offended at his having neglected to pay her such a 
 compliment upon the present occasion. She felt a 
 childish sort of delight at the idea of his being mar- 
 ried; and she was very ready to receive her Daugh- 
 ter-in-Law with open arms ; and to suppose that the 
 happy Object of Horace's choice, must undoubtedly 
 be the most charming Creature in the whole world. 
 
 Lord Altamont was much shocked at his Grand-

 son's unprincipled conduct ; he sincerely regretted a 
 proceeding" which he was too well aware could not 
 fail to have plunged a whole Family into grief and 
 distress ; and he was httle inclined to form a favor- 
 able opinion of a young Lady who had not hesitated 
 to abandon her own natui'al Friends, and to brave the 
 censure of the world. Upon considering the matter 
 more maturely, however, he could not help hoping 
 that Horace's marriage might prove the fortunate 
 means of establishing him at home, and rendering 
 him steadier than he had hitherto been ; — and he felt 
 he had much reason to rejoice that the connection 
 he had formed so rashly, was not a disreputable one. 
 He answered his Letter very kindly, and after a mo- 
 derate proportion of merited reproof, and admonition ; 
 assured him of his pardon, and invited him and Mrs. 
 Algernon to come and make him a visit as soon as it 
 might be agreable to them to do so. 
 
 Lord Altamont wrote also to Sir William Shirley. 
 He expressed much concern at his Grandson's unjus- 
 tifiable behaviour ; observed ' that he trusted it was 
 unnecessary for him to say that his plans and inten-

 tions had been alike unknown and unsanctioned at 
 Altamont Castle.' Added ' that he did not presume 
 to petition Sir William to forgive Mrs. Algernon, or 
 to enter into the merits or demerits of the case ; but 
 that he thought it might be a satisfaction to him to 
 learn, that as she had now become so nearly related to 
 himself, he should do every thing in his power to 
 promote her future welfare and comfort ; and that her 
 Mother-in -Law was likewise prepared to receive her 
 with the greatest kindness.' 
 
 This communication gave much comfort to the 
 Baronet and to Emily, and the former gratefully ac- 
 knowledged the obligation he felt to Lord Altamont, 
 for the very considerate mark of attention he had thus 
 shown towards him. He said ' that he cherished no 
 resentful or unchristian feelings against his Daugh- 
 ter; — ^but as she had certainly wounded him in the 
 lenderest point, he must be convinced of her repen- 
 tance, and of her desire to obtain his pardon, before 
 he could feel incHned to grant it to her.' And in 
 conclusion he remarked, ' that in spite of her unduti- 
 ful conduct, he still entertained so much affection for

 her, that he rejoiced to find she was likely to meet with 
 the undeserved good fortune of being so very kindly 
 and graciousl}" adopted by her Husband's Family.' 
 
 Colonel Algernon and Julia soon grew tired of Paris. 
 The slender supply of money they had taken with 
 them was nearly exhausted, and Horace proposed to 
 his Bride that they should return to England, and ac- 
 cept Lord Altamont's invitation without delay. He 
 told her truly, that he was exceedingly impatient to 
 present her to his Relations ; and he might have 
 added ' that he was not less desirous to come to a 
 speedy understanding with his Grandfather, to pre- 
 vail upon him to pay the remainder of his debts ; and 
 to settle such an allowance upon him, as might ena- 
 ble him to maintain a comfortable establishment as a 
 married Man, — and in short to live in a manner suit- 
 able to his rank and station in the world. 
 
 The amiouncement of her Son's approach threw 
 Mrs. Algernon into an ecstasy of joy. Lord Alta- 
 mont was much pleased at the prospect of seeing 
 him. And the Fugitive Pair recrossed the Channel, 
 under much happier auspices than the conduct of 
 either of them seemed at all to merit.

 Sir Walter Scott, 
 
 Just before Mr. Shirley went into Devonshire, he 
 had interested himself much about a Political Ques- 
 tion of some importance which was likely soon to 
 become a subject of public discussion. In talking it 
 over one evening with his Father and Mr. Vernon, 
 the latter told him that he believed if Arthur had 
 been with them, he could have given him some 
 curious and useful information upon several points 
 connected with this affair; as many circumstances 
 relating to it had at one time accidentally come much 
 under his observation. 
 
 This hint was not lost upon Mr. Shirley, though he 
 appeared to pay little attention to it at the moment.

 The disappointment of all his other hopes, and 
 the mortifications of various kinds which had over- 
 whelmed him lately, had rendered him eager to 
 plunge more deeply than ever into Politics. They 
 afforded an occupation for his time, a diversion for 
 his thoughts ; and since domestic happiness was de- 
 nied him, they held out at least a flattering chance of 
 obtaining public fame and distinction. 
 
 After he returned to Town, he found that the 
 Question above alluded to, would probably be brought 
 forward at an earlier period than he had anticipated ; 
 he therefore thought of writing to Arthur Vernon to 
 request he would communicate to him with as little 
 delay as possible, all the knowledge he had obtained, 
 as well as the opinions he had formed concerning it. 
 Upon reflection however, he recollected how diflScult 
 it was to enter into long details upon paper, and how 
 much more satisfactory it would be to have one 
 hour's conversation with his Cousin than to receive 
 a Volume of Letters from him.

 a visit ; and he surprised him not a Utile by announ- 
 cing- his intention of coming to spend a couple of 
 days with him. He would at all events have been a wel- 
 come Guest, but Arthur now considered him parti- 
 cularly so, as he was well aware that he was able to 
 give him a very recent account of his Mother's health 
 and of the proceedings of all his Relations in Devon- 
 shire. 
 
 He felt deeply interested too in Julia's fate, but 
 upon that subject, he found Mr. Shirley was still so 
 furious, and expressed such implacable resentment 
 towards Colonel Algernon, — that any attempt upon 
 his part to induce him to think of him less unfavor- 
 ably, only encreased his irritation against him. He 
 was even reheved when William turned the conver- 
 sation into a new channel by frankly informing him 
 of the purpose of his journey. 
 
 Arthur was no Politician, but he pointed out his 
 own views very clearly upon the case proposed to 
 him, and displayed an acuteness of observation, and a 
 soundness of judgement that delighted his Cousin. 
 He rejoiced that he had applied to so able a Coun-

 seller, and he spent his time so pleasantly in his 
 society, that he was sorry to leave him at the end of 
 two days to go back to London. He had made an 
 appointment with a Friend who happened to be go- 
 ing to Dover, that they should meet at that place and 
 travel to Town together, and he could not therefore 
 delay his return. 
 
 It chanced unfortunately that on the very morning 
 William arrived at Dover, Colonel Algernon and Julia 
 had landed there in their way to Altamont Castle. 
 
 Julia was much fatigued with the passage, and 
 Horace left her to rest herself at the Inn while he 
 went to make the necessary arrangements with the 
 Custom House Officers, about their Baggage. As he 
 was crossing the Street he almost stumbled against a 
 Gentleman who appeared to have been too absent to 
 have previously noticed him ; — this Person was Wil- 
 liam Shirley, who was walking about to kill the time 
 till his Friend was ready to join him, — and who was 
 beginning to be impatient and out of temper at his 
 detaining him so long. 
 
 Both started, and their mutual astonishment when

 they instantly recognised each other — may be better 
 imagined than described. 
 
 Horace was the first who spoke. " Mr. Shirley," 
 said he, " we were formerly acquainted in Italy, and 
 now that a near relationshijD has taken place between 
 us. I hope we may consider ourselves upon terms of 
 friendship when we happen to be thrown together. 
 Such at least is My desire." — And as he uttered these 
 words, he half extended his hand towards his Bro- 
 ther-in-Law. But William drew himself up in the 
 haughtiest manner; his face became crimson, and his 
 whole frame trembled with indignation, as he replied, 
 
 ''' Colonel Algernon, I must beg to decline all 
 future acquaintance or communication of any sort 
 with a Person who was capable of clandestinely en- 
 gaging my Sister's affections, and dishonorably steal- 
 ing her away from her home, after her Father had 
 informed him that her Family did not consider him 
 worthy of receiving her as his Wife." 
 
 " For the sake of that Sister, I am willing to bear 
 much" answered Horace with a degree of forbear- 
 ance and self-command he was not often accustomed

 ADELAIDE. 109 
 
 to exert ; " but tlieve is a limit to all endurance ; 
 and as I am not sure how long I may be able to con- 
 troul my angry passions if they remain exposed to 
 such provocation as your language seems likely to 
 offer, I believe the sooner we now jDart the better. 
 When we meet again, which in the common inter- 
 course of Society, we must occasionally expect to do, 
 we shall of course look upon each other as Strangers." 
 
 As Horace turned away from him_, Mr. Shirley 
 said, 
 
 '' I have no objection to consent to the neutrality 
 you propose, but mark me well; Upon my part I 
 shall only think myself bound to observe it while you 
 continue to treat my Sister with kindness. The mo- 
 ment I find the slightest cause to suspect that you 
 have behaved towards her with harshness or neglect, 
 you may regard me as your avowed and deadliest 
 Enemy ; and may depend upon my never resting till 
 I have avenged her wrongs." 
 
 '^ When I deserve to undergo your censure for 
 cruelty to my Wife," replied Horace in a sneering, 
 bitter tone, " I shall be very ready to submit to the

 110 ADELAIDE. 
 
 punishment such conduct will richly merit. — In the 
 mean time I am determined that you shall not pro- 
 voke me to quarrel with you. — Once more I bid you 
 amicably Adieu." 
 
 William was much more irritated by the coohiess 
 and temper with which Colonel Algernon had an- 
 swered him, than he would perhaps have been by the 
 most violent and offensive retort. 
 
 " Is there nothing," muttered he to himself, '^ that 
 can produce any impression upon him? He seems 
 to he proof ahke against reproaches and insults ; but 
 if he is not all adamant, I will touch a string* that 
 shall make him feel my power before we part ; and 
 teach him at the same opportunity that I have had 
 sufficient reason to form an unfavorable opinion of 
 his character." 
 
 Horace had already walked some steps away, when 
 Mr. Shirley called after him, 
 
 " Farewell Colonel Algernon ;" and immediately 
 added in a subdued tone, but quite loud enough to be 
 distinctly heard by the ear for which it was intended, 
 
 " I think the Husband of Donna Basiha de Lerma

 need not have been either surprised or offended at 
 any anxiety that might be exjjressed by the Brother 
 of her Successor respecting his future conduct to- 
 wards his Sister." 
 
 Horace turned upon him, and demanded in a voice 
 like thunder, " What he meant by the offensive insi- 
 nuations he was mumbhng to himself?" 
 
 His face was unnaturally pale, and his features 
 were almost convulsed by the fury he had hitherto 
 restrained. 
 
 Mr. Shirley looked at him for a moment with a 
 fiend-like triumph, and then sarcastically observed, 
 " that his own conscience must answer that question. 
 If he had brought any false accusation against him, 
 he should be both willing and happy to beg his par- 
 don ; but he happened to be much better acquainted 
 with the history of his private adventures in Spain 
 than he believed he was at all aware of." 
 
 " I do not see," exclaimed Horace, '' What possi- 
 ble right. You or any one else can have to pry into 
 my domestic proceedings during the period I was 
 upon Service Abroad. Had I disgraced the charac-

 ter of a British Officer, I should have been called 
 to an account by much higher authority than yours. 
 But those under whose command I was placed, bore 
 honorable testimony to my conduct as a Soldier, and 
 I returned to England with untarnished fame. The 
 public have no business with any thing further ; and 
 since you are pleased to bring forward mysterious 
 insinuations against me, are you quite sure that if I 
 thought proper to retaliate upon you, and appeal to 
 your conscience as you have just done to mine, that 
 every secret transaction of your life, would bear the 
 test of so severe and unexpected a scrutiny?" 
 
 This home thrust came so suddenly upon William 
 that it stung him to desperation, and threw him com- 
 pletely off his guard. 
 
 '' I have certainly many crimes to answer for," 
 said he, ''but I am yet guiltless of being a Murderer^ 
 
 The last word was pronounced with emphasis, and 
 it would be vain to attempt to describe the effect it 
 produced upon Horace. He seemed for an instant 
 perfectly bewildered, and then exclaimed in a deep, 
 determined voice.

 " This is more than Mortal Man can bear. Beware 
 how you dare again to associate that term with any 
 imputations connected with me, lest I should oblige 
 you to forfeit your own life in order to save you the 
 disgrace of being a Liar." 
 
 " You know too well that I have spoken the truth," 
 replied Mr. Shirley, " But the altercation between us 
 has now gone so far, that our dispute can never be 
 settled until the life-blood of one or both of us has 
 been shed. We have each said things which neither 
 of us can possibly forget or forgive ; and it onl}' now 
 remains to name the time and place of our next 
 meeting." 
 
 " After what has passed," observed Horace, " it is 
 unnecessary to assure you that that shall be done with 
 the least possible delay upon my part. I never travel

 Widow, should I fall by your hands; — which must

 to attend your summons ; — and no hour 3 ou may fixj

 The Brothers-in-Law separated, after Horace had 
 mentioned that he should be found at the Inn ; and 
 he returned there immediately. He was well ac- 
 quainted with Mr. Jerningham, (one of the Passen- 
 gers who had come over in the Packet with him from 
 Calais :) and he was anxious to see him, as it oc- 
 curred to him that He was the only Person he could 
 ask to be his Second. 
 
 The request was speedily made, and at length ac- 
 ceded to, but Mr. Jerningham at first expressed great 
 repugnance at the idea of being concerned in a Duel 
 between such near Relations. 
 
 To Horace himself, the whole scene that had just 
 taken place, appeared like the remembrance of a fearful 
 Dream. — The vivid recollection which it had recalled 
 of the past, — and the consciousness of the accumu- 
 lated horrors of his present situation, had so com- 
 pletely overwhelmed him, that he was almost stupified; 
 and it was some time before he was capable of setting

 about the arduous task of arranging his Affairs, — 
 which he felt it was an imperious duty to perform to 
 the best of his abihty, and with all possible despatch. 
 
 The thought of seeing Julia was extremely painful 
 to him, and he likewise dreaded that her quickness 
 would enable her to discover that something had gone 
 wrong with him. He was not mistaken, for the mo- 
 ment he rejoined her she was struck with the extra- 
 ordinary alteration in his appearance and manner; 
 and enquired with great anxiety and alarm what had 
 happened to him ? 
 
 He endeavoured to persuade her that her uneasi- 
 ness was unfounded, and attempted to laugh away 
 her apprehensions ; but when she told him, ' she was 
 not to be deceived in that way, — that she was con- 
 vinced some very distressing circumstance had oc- 
 curred to discompose him ; — ^He saw the necessity of 
 inventing some plausible excuse to mislead her. He 
 confessed that her penetration had enabled her to sus- 
 pect a secret which it had been his intention to hide 
 from her. He said ' she was aware that he had been 
 excessively extravagant, and had contracted immense

 debts which he had no means of paying ; and that it 
 was principally in consequence of these embarrass- 
 ments, that he had been obliged before his marriage 
 to live so much abroad. That Lord Altamont had 
 engaged to settle his affairs for him, provided he 
 would promise to establish himself permanently in 
 England; and that this had already in part been 
 done, and would now be completed in a very short 
 time. That unfortunately in walking from the Inn, 
 he had met one of the most importunate of his Credi- 
 tors, — that the Man had been excessively impertinent, 
 and had threatened to arrest him if he did not receive 
 full and immediate payment: — that he had conse- 
 quently put himself into a violent passion, and it had 
 altogether been a very unpleasant business. But 
 that it had at length been tolerably well accommo- 
 dated, — he had succeeded in pacifying the insolent 
 Rascal: — and that as soon as they arrived at Alta- 
 mont Castle, he should be relieved from all further 
 annoyance upon that score.' 
 
 Julia was unacquainted with the value of money, 
 and perfectly ignorant of every thing connected with

 ADELAIDE. 117 
 
 pecuniary transactions. She had hitherto looked upon 
 debts as inconvenient incumbrances, but it had never 
 come in her way to observe or to feel the misery and 
 discomfort they occasioned. 
 
 The very idea of Horace's being arrested, thrown 
 into a Prison ! — petrified her with horror ; — and to 
 prevent the possibility of such a calamity, she pro- 
 posed that they should leave Dover that very instant, 
 and travel without stopping", till they reached Alta- 
 mont Castle. 
 
 Her Husband told her ' that so speedy a departure 
 was quite unnecessary, as all his measures were ami- 
 cably arranged. That he should have the trouble of 
 writing some long Letters upon the Subject, — and 
 that it was probable he might have a short interview 
 with his Tormentor that night, and a longer one early 
 the next morning, — but that these would only be in 
 the way of business, — and boring and disgusting as 
 they were, must be submitted to to avoid more disa- 
 greable consequences.' 
 
 Julia did not feel entirely satisfied with this expla- 
 nation.

 " I hope," said she in a melancholy tone, " that 
 all is indeed comfortably settled with this abominable 
 Man. I trust you have not concealed any thing from 
 me." And Horace's behaviour during the rest of the 
 evening was occasionally so vi^ild, that it was little cal- 
 culated to relieve her anxiety. 
 
 It is now time to return to WilHam Shirley. 
 
 He was soon joined by his future travelling Com- 
 panion, who was much surprised at the state of 
 excitement in which he found him; and extremely 
 shocked when he informed him ' that he had a few 
 moments before met the Villain who had ran away 
 with his Sister, — that high words had passed between 
 them, and that their accidental conference did not 
 terminate until a Challenge had been given by him- 
 self, and accepted by the Person who had so deeply 
 injured him.' 
 
 In vain did Mr. Shirley's Friend use every argu- 
 ment he could think of, to moderate his resentment, 
 and prove to him that his intended Duel — whatever 
 might be its consequences — could bring nothing but 
 misery upon his own head as well as upon all those

 who were related to him. — He represented the agony 
 and despair to which it would reduce his unfortunate 
 Sister; but he could not succeed in making the 
 slightest impression upon Wilham's feelings. His 
 mind was wrought up to such a state phrensy, that 
 he hardened himself against every consideration but 
 the prospect of indulging his vengeance ; and only re- 
 gretted that so many hours must still elapse before 
 his destined meeting with Colonel Algernon could 
 take place. 
 
 Horaces striking likeness to his Cousin Henry, 
 by awakening various galling recollections of his 
 own, had perhaps contributed far more forcibly to 
 excite Mr. Sliirley's implacable and unnatural hatred 
 for him, than any anger he felt towards him upon 
 Julia's account. — But so little do we know ourselves, 
 that he did not suspect what was the Secret Spring 
 by which he was actuated. 
 
 Though his Friend had no power to deter him 
 from his purpose, he kindly determined not to desert 
 him in the hour of danger. He went to Colonel Al- 
 gernon to arrange^ the preliminaries of the Meeting,

 and was referred by him to Mr. Jerningliam, with 
 whom every thing was soon settled. The Parties 
 were to he upon the ground at an early hour the 
 following morning ; and the place selected for the 
 Duel, was a retired spot where they were little likely 
 to be interrupted. To avoid exciting suspicion, and 
 to prevent the chance of Mrs. Algernon's hearing 
 that her Brother was under the same roof as herself, 
 — Mr. Shirley and his Friend were to leave Dover 
 at night, and proceed as if they were anxious to 
 reach Town without delay; but by stopping at the 
 first stage, they would afterwards have very little 
 distance to retrace. 
 
 Horace approved of all that had been decided, 
 but he could by no effort shake off the unusual de- 
 pression that weighed upon his spirits. He was brave 
 and daring almost to rashness, and the probability of 
 his closing his career by a violent death had for him 
 no ten'ors. Yet a mysterious sort of foreboding, such 
 as he had never before experienced, hung over him. 
 He felt that he was going to fight in a bad cause, 
 that he was destined to bring misfortune upon every

 Family that became connected with him; and cer- 
 tain superstitious sensations whispered to his troubled 
 mind that the blood of the murdered and innocent 
 Basilia called out for vengeance, and that some signal 
 punishment was now going* to fall upon him for a 
 crime that had hitherto passed unheeded. He was 
 at a loss to imagine how Mr. Shirley could possibly 
 have become acquainted with his Secret ; and the 
 fact of his being so, added considerably to his dis- 
 quietude. 
 
 He wrote a Letter to Lord Altamont, to be de- 
 livered to him in case of his death, in which he 
 requested him to receive his Widow into his Family 
 and to provide for her comfort ; — and he also wrote 
 to his INIother to beseech her to show every kindness 
 to her Daughter-in-Law for his sake. He addressed 
 a few hunied lines of farewell to Julia herself, — and 
 having thus arranged all his worldly affairs, he en- 
 deavoured to compose himself to rest. 
 
 Colonel Algernon and Mr. Shirley arrived almost 
 at the same moment at the appointed place of meet- 
 ing. A cold salutation was exchanged between them.

 but during the time that the Seconds were employed 
 in measuring the ground, they neither of them seemed 
 disposed to speak. When every thing was prepared, 
 and they were about to take their places, Horace 
 thus addressed their mutual Friends. 
 
 " I beo^ you will understand that I came here 
 against my natural inclination. Mr. Shirley con- 
 ceives that I have injured him by marrying his 
 Sister. It may be so; but no consideration should 
 have induced me to lift my hand against a Person so 
 nearly related to my Wife, if T had not yesterday re- 
 ceived from him an insult which no Man of Honour, 
 no Individual with the feelings of a Gentleman, could 
 possibly submit to without degradation." 
 
 " I am very willing to acknowledge," replied 
 William, " that you behaved with much more for- 
 bearance than I should have expected from my ac- 
 quaintance with your character ; but let me request 
 that all ideas of courtesy may be at an end between 
 us. — That you will look upon me as your implacable 
 Foe, and point your Weapon with as deadly a reso- 
 lution against My breast, as it is my intention to 
 direct mine against yours."

 Horace made no answer, the sig-nal was given, and 
 they both fired with the most harmless effect. 
 
 The Seconds immediately came forward and en- 
 deavoured to accommodate the quarrel. Colonel 
 Algernon did not appear at all averse to the proposal 
 of a reconciliation. He said ' that as he had given his 
 Antagonist no provocation, he could not be expected 
 to offer any overtures of a pacific nature ; but that if 
 Mr. Shirley was inclined to make him a proper apo- 
 logy, and to recal the offensive words he had utter- 
 ed; he should be very ready to receive it, and to 
 forget what had passed.' 
 
 WilHam would not however listen for an instant to 
 the idea of an amicable adjustment. He declared 
 ' that he came there to fight, not to beg pardon of his 
 Antagonist ; and that they must fire again.' 
 
 " I am not afraid," he added in a sarcastic tone, 
 " of taking my chance of standing within the range 
 of Colonel Algernon's Pistol ; " and it was in a voice 
 audible to Horace alone, that he concluded, " though 
 I am very well aware that when it is his intention to 
 bring down his Victim, he possesses the rare art of 
 seldom missing his aim."

## p. 124 (#138) ############################################


 
 124 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Horace was roused to fury by this malicious and 
 unjustifiable taunt. 
 
 " By Heaven '." he exclaimed, " the skill he boasts 
 of shall not fail me now. I spared him once ; but 
 
 this time " 
 
 Before he could finish the sentence, Mr. Shirley's 
 Ball whizzed past his head, and just grazed his hat 
 without doing him any further injury. 
 
 His own fire was more truly directed; William 
 staggered, and fell ! 
 
 Before the Surgeon who had accompanied them 
 to the ground, had time to examine the extent of the 
 mischief; the wounded Man told his Second, as he 
 attempted to raise him from the earth, that he knew 
 from his feelings his hurt was mortal; he therefore 
 besought him to leave him to his fate, and think only 
 of providing for his own safety. 
 
 But this was a proposition which his Friend had 
 too much generosity to accede to. 
 
 When Colonel Algernon saw his unfortunate Anta- 
 gonist fall, the rage which had animated him an 
 instant before, gave place to an indescribable sensa- 
 tion of horror. He seemed almost rooted to the spot

 where he stood, and scarcely heard Mr. Jerningham 
 as he earnestly and repeatedly suggested to him the 
 absolute necessity of their immediate flight. 
 
 At length he appeared to understand his represen- 
 tations, for he hastily replied, 
 
 " Pray urge me no more. — 1 much wish that you 
 would take care of Yourself. It is of little conse- 
 quence what becomes of a Wretch like me. / cannot 
 leave this place till I have heard the Surgeon's re- 
 port." 
 
 The Medical Man had by this time ascertained 
 the nature of the wound, he came up to Colonel Al- 
 gernon; and in answer to his enquiries, he merely 
 shook his head, and advised him to leave the Country 
 as speedily as he could. 
 
 On Horace's impetuously declaring he did not un- 
 derstand inuendoes, and desiring him to speak more 
 plainly ; he told him " that since he wished to know 
 the truthj it was his duty to inform him that Mr. 
 Shirley might probably live a few hours, but that in 
 his opinion it was impossible he could survive the 
 day."

 126 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Horace did not sjDeak a word when he received 
 this intelligence, but he looked as if he was going to 
 faint; and he still lingered near the wounded Sufferer 
 as if he was unable to depart without having obtained 
 his forgiveness. 
 
 The Surgeon observed this ; he had not concealed 
 his danger from his Patient, and he now asked him if 
 he was not wiUing to shake hands with Colonel Al- 
 gernon ? 
 
 Mr. Shirley started. " No, — Yes, — " exclaimed 
 he, " I am ready to do any thing to get rid of his 
 presence." 
 
 The Surgeon beckoned to Horace, who instantly 
 advanced, and bending over William, said in an al- 
 most inaudible voice, and with deep emotion ; " that 
 he hoped he would not refuse to pardon him for a 
 Deed which must entail regret and misery of the bit- 
 terest description upon himself to the last day of his 
 existence." 
 
 " I own before all the world," replied Mr. Shirley, 
 " that I found you sufficiently reluctant to abridge the 
 life I placed in your power : until I goaded you on to

 do SO by means which I knew to be irresistible. The 
 blame in this business is mine, and / must pay the 
 forfeit for it. — ^I grow faint, and cannot say more. 
 Farewell. I beg that you will leave me." 
 
 As Mr. Shirley could not have borne the motion 
 of a Carriage, his Second and the Medical Man de- 
 termined to carry him to the nearest Cottage. 
 
 He had requested that the Post Boy who had 
 driven him to the place of Meeting, might be sent 
 express to Captain Vernon; and a Note had accor- 
 dingly been written to Arthur in pencil, briefly in- 
 forming him of what had happened, and requiring him 
 to repair to his unfortunate Cousin with all the despatch 
 which so desperate a case demanded. William was 
 extremely anxious that he should arrive before he 
 expired, and his Friend promised to remain with him 
 until Captain Vernon made his appearance. 
 
 Having heard all these arrangements concluded, 
 and perceiving that he could be of no further assis- 
 tance; Mr. Jerningham hurried Horace towards the 
 carriage that was waiting for them, and desired the 
 Driver to take them back to Dover.

 128 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " To Dover," repeated his Companion, who seem- 
 ed recalled to a new train of recollections by having 
 caught the sound of that vv^ord. " My God, how shall 
 I dare to meet Julia while the life-blood of her Bro- 
 ther is still warm and reeking upon my hands ?" 
 
 " It is indeed a most unfortunate, a most lamen- 
 table business 1" replied Mr. Jerningham. " But you 
 have at least the consolation of knowing that the Duel 
 was not one of your own seeking ; that it was forced 
 upon you ; and that you could not, without compro- 
 mising your honour, have acted in any other way than 
 you have done." 
 
 " True, true;" exclaimed Horace, " He rejected 
 all my overtures with insulting disdain ; he persisted 
 in heaping upon me the most cutting and insufferable 
 insults. — ^I have taken my revenge ! But his death 
 will destroy my happiness and completely ruin all my 
 future prospects." 
 
 " The first thing to be considered at present," said 
 Mr. Jerningham, who was anxious to divert him from ^' 
 dwelling upon these distressing reflections, and to 
 awaken him to the necessity of exertion, — " is the

 best means of getting you out of this Country before 
 you can be an*ested by the strong arm of the Law. 
 We must both recross the Channel without an in- 
 stant's delay. I imagine Mrs. Algernon will of course 
 accompany you in your flight." 
 
 " Poor Thing," observed Horace, " I wish she 
 was with my Mother at Altamont Castle ; but I can- 
 not send her there alone, and as I have no Friend 
 here with whom I can possibly leave her, — there is 
 no alternative ; — she must certainly follow my despe- 
 rate fortunes. — Yet the greatest difficulty still remains. 
 How can I summon courage to break to her the cala- 
 mity that I have brought upon her ? I cannot, I feel 
 that I cannot ever have the heart to do so." 
 
 " That must be my painful task," answered his 
 Companion. " You are not just now in a state to 
 undertake it, or to he capable of making the arrange- 
 ments for our return to Calais." 
 
 And accordingly when they arrived within half a 
 mile of Dover, Mr. Jerningham ordered the Post Boy 
 to stop. Pie persuaded him to promise, on receiving 
 a large bribe, that he would not mention a word of 
 
 VOL. III. I

 what had taken place to any living Creature during 
 tlie next twelve hours. And that if any questions 
 were asked him when he reached home, he would 
 merely say ' that the Gentlemen he had driven, had 
 left the Chaise and preferred coming back on foot/ — 
 
 '' It is better we should walk the rest of our way," 
 said he to Horace. " The return of an empty Hack 
 Chaise will attract no attention; hut if we were to 
 drive up in it to the Inn door, we might probably 
 subject ourselves to very inconvenient observation. I 
 know a Person in the Town in whom I can safely 
 confide, we will go in the first instance to his House 
 and persuade him to settle every thing for us about 
 our departure, our passage, &c. &c. &c. He is under 
 some obhgations to me, and I have little doubt of his 
 agreeing to perform this kind office." 
 
 Mr. Jerningham was not mistaken. He had no 
 sooner briefly explained the state of the case, than his 
 Friend engaged to manage all the requisite prelimi- 
 naries, and to secure comfortable accommodations for 
 the number of persons he named, — on board a Vessel 
 that was expected to sail for the Coast of France in

 about four hours. — He furnished Horace with writing 
 materials, and while the wretched Young Man at- 
 tempted to give Lord Altamont something like a con- 
 nected account of his unfortunate Meeting with Mr. 
 Shirley, and of the fatal consequences that had re- 
 sulted from it ; his Companion left him, and proceeded 
 to the Inn to communicate to Julia the misery that 
 awaited her. 
 
 She had been up a long time, and he found her in 
 a state of the greatest anxiety and uneasiness at the 
 protracted absence of her Husband. She looked ea- 
 gerly towards the door as he entered the room, and 
 exclaimed in a tone of disappointment, 
 
 " I thought it had been Colonel Algernon. — You 
 are an early Visitor Mr. Jerningham." 
 
 " And I am afraid not a welcome one," replied he. 
 " It is my misfortune to he the bearer of very unplea- 
 sant news." 
 
 Julia turned extremely pale. 
 
 " That odious Creditor," she said, " cannot surely 
 have tormented Horace again? After every thing 
 was so amicably accommodated between them last

 night, he cannot have been so unreasonable as to mo- 
 lest him a second time ? He has not dared to throw 
 him into Prison ?" 
 
 " I have not heard a word about any troublesome 
 Creditor," answered Mr. Jerningham. 
 
 " But have you seen Horace ?" interrupted Julia. 
 '' Can you tell me what is become of him ?" 
 
 " I can indeed. Let me however entreat you to 
 be more composed, and to arm yourself with resolu- 
 tion to bear the melancholy and afflicting intelligence 
 
 am come to unfold.'' 
 
 " Speak it quickly," cried Julia in great agitation. 
 ''• Conceal no circumstance from me. I wish to know 
 the worst, and to know it immediately. I am not, I 
 assure you, unprepared for bad news. Horace con- 
 trived to quiet my suspicions, by telling me a plausi- 
 ble Story about a debt, — ^but he could not quite 
 deceive me ; I discovered that he had been more 
 violently distressed than it was natural he would have 
 been by such an occurrence. In short I read that in 
 his countenance which foreboded something dreadful. 
 And no words can describe the misery of the suspense 
 and apprehension I have this morning endured."

 ADELAIDE. 133 
 
 " I will not prolong that suspense," replied Mr. 
 Jerningham. " Yet, alas ! I fear you will find that 
 the anticipation of evil was less agonizing than the 
 reality. By a most unhappy chance. Colonel Alger- 
 non met Mr. Shirley in the Street yesterday evening, 
 and they were so close to each other that it was im- 
 possible they could pass without some signs of recog- 
 nition." 
 
 Juha started violently. " Could my Brother be 
 
 at Dover yesterday ?" she exclaimed. " But pray 
 
 go on." 
 
 " On the part of Colonel Algernon the greeting 
 was highly conciliatory, but it was returned by Mr. 
 Shirley not merely with coldness, but with the most 
 contemptuous indignation." 
 
 '' I hope," said Julia, and the colour came back to 
 her cheek as she spoke, '' that Horace did not demean 
 himself by making any concessions to William, when 
 he chose to treat him in the insolent manner you 
 describe." 
 
 " My Friend behaved, I believe," continued Mr. 
 Jerningham, " with admirable calmness and modera-

 tion. I grieve to say that Mr, Shirley did not scruple 
 to assail him with insults which no Gentleman could 
 tamely submit to, and finally he obliged him to accept 
 a Challenge to meet him in the Field at an early hour 
 this morning." 
 
 '' You need not tell me the rest ;" cried Julia in an 
 agony of despair. '^ I know, I know it all. Horace 
 is killed 1 My cruel, my unnatural Brother has mur- 
 dered him !" 
 
 And she wrung her hands and wildly tore her hair 
 in the bitterness of her distress, — as she exclaimed at 
 broken intervals ; " It is I who have been the cause 
 of all this. — Oh where shall I be able to hide my 
 guilty head ? — I have deserted my own Relations, and 
 now that Horace, my beloved Horace is gone, I have 
 not a Friend left in the world to take pity upon me 
 in my misery !" 
 
 Her screams were so loud and so piercing, that 
 they brought the Landlady and the Waiter into the 
 room in great alarm, to enquire what had happened 
 to her ? 
 
 Mr. Jerningham quietly told them ' that the Lady

 ADELAIDE. 135 
 
 had just heard unexpectedly of the death of a near 
 Relation, and that the distressing intelligence had 
 brought on a violent paroxysm of an hysterical affec- 
 tion to which she was constitutionally subject.' He 
 said he had no doubt she would soon be better, and 
 he begged them to retire, and to send her a glass of 
 cold water, (which was the only thing she could take 
 upon these occasions,) by her own Maid. — He had 
 hitherto purposely allowed Julia to entertain the erro- 
 neous belief of her Husband's death; — and when her 
 Maid appeared with the glass of water, he took it from 
 her hands, and desired her to have all her Mistress's 
 things in readiness for her immediate departure. 
 
 " Where are you going to take me ?" asked Julia, 
 who had partly overheard this direction. 
 
 '' Will you not let me see him ?" added she more 
 wildly. — '^ I must, — I will look upon him once again. 
 You cannot surely wish to deny me the wretched 
 satisfaction of beholding his mangled Remains !" 
 
 " You shall certainly see Colonel Algernon," said 
 Mr. Jerningham, soothingly, " And in very different 
 circumstances from what you expect. I have never 
 told you that he was not alive."

 136 ADELAIDE. 
 
 " This is too barbarous !" exclaimed Julia. " You 
 will drive me mad, if you mock me thus with false 
 hopes." — 
 
 Then hastily catching at another idea, she enquired 
 eagerly, 
 
 " Can it be possible that Horace still breathes? 
 Your face confesses it ! — If indeed he does : Oh lead 
 me to him this instant ; it may not yet be too late. 
 Why did you not undeceive me sooner ? It was in- 
 human to waste so much precious time." 
 
 " Horace," answered Mr. Jerningham, endeavour- 
 ing to restrain her impetuosity, '•' Is not only alive, 
 he is unhurt, and will be here presently to assure you 
 of this truth himself. I grieve to add, however, that 
 Mr. Shirley has not made an equally fortunate escape." 
 
 The scream of hysterical joy which had burst from 
 Julia's lips on hearing of her Husband's safety, was 
 suddenly hushed when she learnt her Brother's dread- 
 ful fate. The violent emotion which had almost 
 convulsed her features a few moments before, was 
 immediately succeeded by an expression of calm and 
 indescribable horror; and her passionate and agoni- 
 zing grief, seemed at once changed to mute and

 ADELAIDE. 137 
 
 hopeless despair. So paralysing was the effect of this 
 last blow, that it appeared for some time to have de- 
 prived her both of feeling and consciousness. 
 
 At length she asked in a low hollow voice, and 
 without raising her eyes, " if her Brother was dead ?" 
 
 Mr. Jerningham informed her '• that he had not 
 expired when he left him, but that his case was quite 
 hopeless, and that he had little doubt all must now be 
 over.' 
 
 " Poor WilHam !" said Julia, in a tone which went 
 to her Companion's heart. — " My Father too, and 
 Emily ! — Oh miserable, wicked Creature that I am. 
 I am at once unfit to live or to die. Would that the 
 Earth could open this instant beneath my feet, and

 After this burst of remorse and anguish, she re- 
 lapsed into silence. She shed no tear, she took no 
 notice of any thing around her, but remained fixed 
 and motionless as a Statue. Mr. Jerningham endea- 
 voured in vain to rouse her from this fearful torpor. 
 He attempted by turns to soothe, to comfort, and to 
 argue with her. She scarcely seemed to hear, and

 she certainly paid no attention to one word tliat he 
 said. He began to entertain fears for her reason, and 
 he determined to try what effect the sight of her Hus- 
 band might produce, in restoring her to a less unna- 
 tural state of mind. 
 
 He recalled her Maid, and desiring her not to dis- 
 turb her Mistress or pretend to take any particular 
 notice of her; but upon no account to leave her till 
 he and Colonel Algernon returned : He went back to 
 Horace, who was anxiously and impatiently awaiting 
 the result of his Mission. 
 
 He gave him a short relation of what had passed, 
 and without allowing him an instant's reflection, he 
 hurried him away to the Inn, dragging him along 
 almost by force. When they arrived at the door of 
 the apartment where Julia was, Mr. Jerningham 
 beckoned to the Maid ; and pushing Horace into the 
 room, left the unhappy Pair alone together. 
 
 Mrs. Algernon was still sitting absorbed in her 
 grief, and looking the mute picture of hopeless woe 
 she has been already described. Horace gazed upon 
 her with agony and dismay.

 " Julia," said he at length in an imploring tone, 
 " Jiiliaj can you ever forgive me ?" 
 
 At the sound of his voice she started, looked up and 
 fixing her eyes for a moment upon the sorrow-stricken 
 countenance of him whom she had so short a time 
 before lamented as dead, — she burst into a violent 
 flood of tears; and rising fi'om her seat, as he ad- 
 vanced towards her, she rushed into his arms. 
 
 The morning was wearing rapidly away, and 
 Horace was explaining to his Wife that after the 
 calamity which had fallen upon him, it was unsafe 
 for him to stay an hour longer in England ; when 
 she happened to cast her eye upon the sleeve of his 
 coat. Unperceived by himself or by any one who 
 had been with him, it retained the mark of a spot of 
 blood. Julia caught a glance of the fatal stain, and 
 starting wildly from him, — her first paroxysms of 
 horror and distress returned with redoubled violence. 
 
 It would be painful to dwell upon the dreadful 
 continuation of such a Scene. Neither Horace nor 
 Mr. Jeniingham could succeed in calming the trans- 
 ports of her despair, and it was only by working upon

 her fears for the security of the former, that they con- 
 trived to persuade her to accompany them on board 
 the Vessel that was to convey them to France. 
 
 They got away just in time. Juha's extraordinary 
 behaviour, and Colonel Algernon's agitated appear- 
 ance, had given rise to strange surmises amongst the 
 Inhabitants of the Inn. And although the Post Boy 
 > who had driven Horace and his Friend to and from 
 the place of Meeting, had not betrayed the trust re- 
 posed in him ; — Various Rumours began to be circu- 
 lated and believed at Dover, of a Duel having been 
 fought a few miles from that Town which had termi- 
 nated fatall)^ to one of the Parties concerned. 
 
 In the course of the day the intelligence of this 
 affair Avas fully and circumstantially received, and 
 Persons empowered to apprehend Colonel Algernon 
 and his Second for the offence they had committed, 
 arrived in pursuit of them ; but before they made 
 their appearance, the Fugitives had sailed for the 
 Continent.

 The place to which Mr. Shirley was conveyed was 
 a small Farm House where he received every kind- 
 ness and attention that it was in the power of the 
 Inhabitants to bestow, but where he was of course 
 destitute of many of the comforts and alleviations 
 which a Person in his circumstances required. He 
 was put into a clean and homely bed, in a little room 
 not generally occupied by the Family ; his Medical 
 Attendant took his station by his side, while his 
 Friend was too much agitated to remain fixed in any 
 one position. 
 
 William suffered far more from anguish of mind 
 than ftom actual bodily pain, and this brought on a 
 sort of irritation which was extremely distressing.

 and which encreased in the same proportion as his 
 strength became exhausted. He had calculated the 
 probahle period that must elapse before his Cousin's 
 arrival, and he looked forward to that moment with 
 a feverish impatience — which it is easier to imagine 
 than to describe. He was afraid that if any thing 
 occurred to delay Arthur^ he might not come in time 
 to find him alive ; and he had many reasons to be 
 peculiarly anxious to see him. To so near and so 
 valued a Relation, he felt that he could freely un- 
 burthen his mind. He had prepared no written com- 
 munication of any sort for his Father ; and he was 
 extremely desirous that his Cousin should undertake 
 the arduous and delicate commission of conveying his 
 last farewell to his Family, — and of informing them 
 of all the melancholy particulars of his death. 
 
 Captain Vernon was inexpressibly shocked at re- 
 ceiving the intelhgence of the fatal event which had 
 just taken place ; and he did not lose a moment in 
 preparing to obey the summons of his unfortunate 
 Relation. He had no difficulty in getting permission 
 to fly immediately to attend Mr. Shirley during his

 last agonies ; and as it occurred to him that it would 
 probably fall to his lot to be the Bearer of the cala- 
 mitous tidings of what had happened, to his Uncle ; 
 he also obtained a conditional leave of absence to 
 enable him to proceed without delay into Devonshire, 
 should he find it expedient or necessary for him to 
 do so. 
 
 Arthur gave directions to his Servant and to the 
 Post Boy to follow him, — and then galloped with 
 such desperate speed towards the spot where the latter 
 had explained to him that the wounded Man was to 
 be carried, — that he reached his destination much 
 sooner than might have been hoped, even by those 
 who were so eagerly expecting him. As he was well 
 acquainted with that part of the Country, he easily 
 found the Farm House, and was met at the door by 
 Mr. Shirley's Friend who had heard the rapid ap- 
 proach of a Horseman, and had gone down stairs to 
 reconnoitre and receive him. 
 
 A few words of question and reply, confirmed Ar- 
 thur's worst fears, and he hun'ied to the bed side of 
 his Cousin, who had likewise caught the sound of an 
 an-ival and was agonized with impatience to see him.

 The meeting between them under such circum- 
 stances, was extremely affecting. WiUiam was the 
 first who recovered his composure, and turning to his 
 Second, he told him ' that as Captain Vernon was 
 now come to take care of him, he should really be 
 distressed if he remained with him lonorer.' 
 
 o 
 
 "It is painful to me," he continued, addressing the 
 Surgeon, " to endanger the safety of any one. I am 
 persuaded that no Medical skill can he of fm-ther ser- 
 vice to me. You will therefore oblige me, if you 
 will leave me. — I am deeply grateful to you both for 
 the disinterested kindness you have already shown 
 me." 
 
 It was not without sincere regret that his Friend 
 agreed to the expediency of an immediate departure, 
 but none of WilHam's arguments could prevail upon 
 the Medical Man to accompany him ; as he said ' it 
 was impossible to know what change might take 
 place in his Patient, or how far his professional aid 
 might be required, in the course of the next few 
 hours.' — He retired however into another room, as it 
 was evident that Mr. Shirley wished to have some 
 confidential conversation with his Cousin.

 William detailed minutely every circumstance 
 that had preceded the Duel, and recounted all that 
 had passed upon the ground ; without attempting in 
 the slightest degree to palliate the violence of his own 
 conduct, or to throw any unmerited blame upon that 
 of Horace Algernon. He said ' he was convinced 
 that it was the accidental knowledge of a fatal secret, 
 which alone, had empowered him to urge on his re- 
 luctant Antagonist to the Act of vengeance which had 
 been committed.' 
 
 Arthur endeavoured to calm the agitation of his 
 spirits, to soothe him into a more charitable and chris- 
 tian frame of mind, and thus insensibly to lead him 
 to prepare himself for that World towards which it 
 was evident he was rapidly hastening. 
 
 But William suddenly broke off the thread of his 
 observations, by exclaiming impatiently, 
 
 " Do not talk to me in that way. I know that I 
 have been a grievous Sinner. But the few short 
 moments that remain to me, are gliding fast into 
 eternity. It is now too late to repent." 
 
 Arthur ventured gently to hint ' that we are

 taught to hope that when it is sincere, no repentance 
 however late — will prove entirely unavailing.' 
 
 " I sent for You," replied William, fiercely, " to 
 comfort me, not to torment me before my time. If I 
 could live my life over again, I think, — I believe that 
 I should act in every respect very differently from 
 what I have done. Yet I cannot by a single pang of 
 vain remorse, at once transform myself from a Scep- 
 tical Sinner to a Saint. I must not hope that any 
 thing short of a miracle, can enable me in an instant 
 to obtain a complete mastery over those evil passions 
 which have acquired fearful strength during long 
 years of uncontrouled indulgence. — I feel, I feel that 
 I am under their dominion now. Hatred, revenge, 
 and fury, still distract my brain, and keep out better 
 thoughts. It would be worse than hypocrisy in a 
 guilty Wretch in such a state as I am, to dare to 
 speak of a contrition I know too certainly I never can 
 experience." 
 
 Arthur was both silenced and horrified by this 
 shocking confession. He saw that if he pressed his 
 point further he should only render his unhappy

 Cousin's feelings more desperate, — and by aggrava- 
 ting his mental excitement, perhaps anticipate the 
 total failure of that bodily strength which seemed 
 already to be rapidly deserting him. 
 
 After a distressing pause of some duration, he 
 therefore merely asked William, 
 
 '' If there was any thing he wished him to do for 
 him? Any directions, — any message he desired 
 him to convey to any one ?" 
 
 " As soon as all is over," replied Mr. Shirley, " I 
 hope you will go to my Father. I need not request 
 you to be a comforter to Him and Emily under the 
 affliction I have brought upon them. Alas, if they 
 knew me as I know myself, they would have little 
 reason to lament my loss! They would rather re- 
 joice that I did not live long enough to be exposed 
 to public infamy and dishonour ; and thus to involve 
 every body connected with me in shame, disgrace, 
 and misery." 
 
 Arthur imagined that his Cousin's senses began to 
 wander, and he made no effort to interrupt him as he 
 continued, —

 " Upon my own account I can have no desire to 
 dra^ on an existence which disappointment of the 
 bitterest description, in the first instance rendered 
 indifferent to me; and which became hateful from 
 the instant I forfeited my self-respect. Had Ade- 
 laide Fauconberg returned my affection, it would 
 have been far otherwise! It was that fatal attach- 
 ment which blighted all my prospects of happiness, 
 and occasioned the ruin and despair that are my por- 
 tion now." 
 " You may at least," said Captain Vernon in a sooth- 
 ing tone, " indulge the melancholy satisfaction of 
 believing that She who could not love you in life, 
 will not fail hereafter to recollect you with feelings of 
 pity, tenderness, and regret." 
 
 " No, no," exclaimed William, wildly, " she will 
 detest my memory. She has too much cause to do 
 so. — My death will be a subject of great relief to 
 her. I have hitherto formed the only impediment 
 which has successfully opposed her Union with 
 Henry Algernon, — the Man she adores. — Their Mar- 
 riage will now take place whenever he returns to

 England; and the assurance that Adelaide will at 
 length become the Wife of my brilUant, my detested 
 Rival, — is the poisoned Shaft which agonizes me a 
 thousand times more keenly than all the other dread- 
 ful reflections which have conspired to torment and 
 distract me during the last few hours." 
 
 His countenance was fearfully convulsed for some 
 minutes after he concluded these words. Arthur was 
 so petrified with what he had heard, that he was quite 
 unable to speak ; and he stood gazing upon the mise- 
 rable Victim of ungoverned passion who lay extended 
 before him; and expecting that every struggle he 
 witnessed would terminate his earthly suflferings. 
 
 By degrees however William became more tran- 
 quil, and signing to his Cousin to take the vacant 
 seat by his bed side which the Surgeon had origi- 
 nally occupied ; he told him ' that he thought he 
 should feel easier if he communicated to him a Secret 
 which had long weighed heavily upon his conscience ; 
 and which it was not impossible he might eventually 
 learn through some other channel. In short that 
 painful as the effort would be, he had detennined to

 150 ADELAIDE. 
 
 disclose it to him, — even at the risk of forfeiting his 
 esteem and degrading himself in his good opinion for 
 ever.' And then v^rithout waiting to hear Arthur's 
 assurances of sympathy and indulgence, he gave him 
 a hurried account of the progress of his passion for 
 Adelaide, of the treacherous encouragement he had 
 received from her Mother, and the determined re- 
 jection he had met with from herself. He scarcely 
 trusted himself to speak upon the despair he felt 
 when he witnessed the happiness of his Rival; and 
 he was much agitated when he entered upon the dis- 
 graceful History to which his other details had only 
 formed the Preface, — and related with unflinching 
 accuracy, every particular of the degrading transac- 
 tion which had followed his interview with Wood- 
 gate ; and explained all the consequences which had 
 resulted from the scheme of Villany he had adopted. 
 '' From the moment," he concluded, " when I 
 leagued myself in dishonour with such an Associate, 
 I subjected myself to endure continual shame, vexa- 
 tion, and misery. And the Deed of Darkness which 
 destroyed my peace, and embittered the remaining

 portion of my life, has now also been the occasion of 
 plunging me with all my Sins upon my head, into a 
 bloody and untimely grave." 
 
 " My dear William," said Arthur, affectionately 
 pressing his Cousin's hand, " far be it from me to 
 censure you too severely for having acted in the man- 
 ner you now so justly deplore. If you have deeply 
 erred, you have likewise been signally punished ; and 
 we must not forget that when you first gave way to 
 the temptation that beset you, your passions had been 
 violently agitated, and you were still under the influ- 
 ence of extraordinary and powerful excitement." 
 
 " True, true : there was indeed that excuse," 
 exclaimed Mr. Shirley eagerly. Then suddenly 
 changing his tone, he continued in a subdued and 
 melancholy voice, " yet this is no hour to encourage 
 self-delusion. The baseness of my conduct appears 
 before me in all its naked deformity ; and Oh, I 
 begin to feel the folly and wickedness of those scep- 
 tical doubts which unsettled my principles, and pre- 
 pared the way for my ruin and destruction here, and 
 the eternal misery of my wretched Soul hereafter."

 As he finished these words he sunk back upon his 
 pillow, apparently exhausted with the exertion he 
 had made in speaking- so long, and upon such agita- 
 ting subjects. Arthur could scarcely conceal the 
 anguish of his own feelings, but he perceived that his 
 Cousin was not in a state to be sensible of what was 
 passing around him. And as he thought he seemed 
 to require Medical aid, he recalled the Surgeon from 
 the adjoining room. 
 
 Several hours elapsed before William ceased to 
 breathe. At times he talked incoherently, and at 
 other intervals he broke out into the wildest ravings 
 of despair. Once only he appeared to be aware of 
 what he was saying ; he had been looking calmly at 
 his Cousin, and at length he drew him towards him, 
 and whispered with a smile, 
 
 "• Arthur You will prove a greater comfort to my 
 Father than ever I should have been. He already 
 lo\ es you as if you were his Son. — ^You need not start 
 at my making use of that term ; — a deficiency of for- 
 tune was the only consideration which deterred him 
 from sanctioning an Union, otherwise calculated to

 ensure the happiness of the two Pei'sons dearest to 
 him in the world. When Emily becomes the Heiress 
 of Greyfield, that impediment will he removed ; and 
 without possessing the Prophetic Talent with which 
 those in my present circumstances, are said sometimes 
 to be gifted, — it is easy for me to foresee that your 
 mutual constancy will at no distant period be rewarded 
 
 as it so well deserves. It is strange that my death 
 
 should smooth away the secret sorrows of almost all 
 those whose welfare has interested me most deeply 
 during my life 1" 
 
 Arthur was too much affected to be able to utter a 
 single syllable in reply, but his tears fell fast upon the 
 Sufferer's hand, and before he could recover himself 
 the brief gleam of consciousness and recollection 
 which had come over William's mind, had again en- 
 tirely deserted him. The kindness and consideration 
 he had shown towards his Cousin, left however an 
 impression that did not pass so rapidly away. Long 
 afterwards did Arthur recal with no ordinary emo- 
 tion, the sentences he had spoken at that moment, 
 and retrace in imagination the very look and gesture 
 that had accompanied them.

 As soon as Mr. Shirley's mortal agonies were over, 
 Captain Vernon felt the necessity of exerting himself 
 instead of giving way to unavailing grief. 
 
 After a short consultation v^^ith the Surgeon, he sent 
 for his own Servant, — a trusty Man who had lived 
 with him some years ; explained to him the reason 
 that called for his immediate departure, and gave him 
 the orders and directions he required him to attend to 
 during his absence. He then hired a Horse of the 
 Farmer, and rode on to Dover, where he had various 
 arrangements to make before he could set out upon 
 his Journey to Devonshire. 
 
 During the short time he remained at that place he 
 ascertained that Colonel Algernon and Julia had actu- 
 ally re-embarked for the Continent, — a piece of infor- 
 mation which afforded him much relief. 
 
 His measures were judiciously planned, and as 
 promptly carried into execution : and it was not until 
 after he was fairly shut up in the Post Chaise which 
 was to convey him to his Uncle, that he found leisure 
 to indulge those melancholy and heart-rending reflec- 
 tions which the dreadful fate of his Cousin too pain- 
 fully suggested. He threw himself back in the

 Carriage, and covering his face with his hands, gave 
 free vent to the bitter and distressing feelings which 
 had hitherto been with so much dijSiculty restrained. 
 
 Arthur's journey appeared to him to be interminable, 
 and yet as he drew nearer its conclusion he began to 
 look forward with indescribable dread to the moment 
 of his arrival at the place of his destination. He 
 wished it might be possible for him to have an inter- 
 view with his Father before any of the rest of the 
 Family were aware of his visit; as he thought that 
 Mr. Vernon might be able to prepare Sir WilHam and 
 Emily to learn by degrees the fearful calamity that 
 had befallen them, — and thus mitigate the shock they 
 must experience if they heard it too suddenly. 
 
 It was late in the afternoon when he came in sight 
 of the Abode that contained his Relations ; he grew 
 violently agitated, and having desired the Post Boy 
 not to drive up to the door, he got out of the Chaise 
 as it turned into the approach, — and determined that 
 while it was proceeding towards the Stable Yard, he 
 would himself enter the House through the Offices. 
 
 While making the requisite detour to accomplish

 this purpose, the perversity of his fate led him to 
 stumble upon the two Persons whom in his present 
 circumstances he felt the most anxious to avoid : in 
 turning the sharp angle of a plantation path, he 
 met his Mother and Emily. They were coming 
 home from a walk, Mrs. Vernon was leaning upon 
 her Niece's arm, — and as the latter raised her eyes to 
 observe some object her Companion had pointed out 
 to her: Arthur remarked that his Cousin's counte- 
 nance was become paler and more thoughtful than it 
 had formerly been. Her beauty, however, seemed to 
 him far from diminished by this alteration in its cha- 
 racter, and he fancied he had never before seen her 
 look half so interesting and lovely. 
 
 All this was the reflection of an instant, for Mrs. 
 Vernon had recognised her Son, and she had scarcely 
 time to utter an exclamation of surprise before he was 
 folded in her arms. 
 
 " My dear Arthur," said she, endeavouring to 
 compose her fluttered spirits, " I am still almost una- 
 ble to credit the evidence of my own senses, and to 
 beheve that you are really here. It must be some-

 thing very extraordinary and important that has 
 brought you so unexpectedly to visit us. Your ap- 
 pearance too," she continued examining him more 
 attentively ; " is fearfully wild and haggard, — You 
 tremhle from head to foot ! — Arthur, Arthur it abso- 
 lutely shocks me to look at you. — Why do you not 
 speak ? You are ill, or unhappy, or both." 
 
 " You know me so well," answered Arthur, in a 
 melancholy tone, " that it would be useless, even if I 
 had the desire to do so, to attempt to deny that it was 
 no trivial cause that induced me to come into Devon- 
 shire ; and it would be equally vain if I pretended to 
 conceal from you that my errand is of a peculiarly 
 painful nature. — But before I disclose it to you more 
 fully, I believe it will be far better for me to talk it 
 over with my Father." 
 
 " At any rate you may tell me, may you not ?" 
 enquired Mrs. Vernon, very anxiously, " Who is the 
 Person this alarming mystery principally concerns." 
 
 " Alas !" replied Arthur, " it very deeply concerns 
 us all." 
 
 " Answer me one question more," exclaimed his

 Mother in a faltering voice, " And my interrogations 
 
 will be at an end. Have you heard any bad news 
 
 of your Brother who is at Sea ?" 
 
 " I have not heard of him at all very lately, and I 
 am always inclined to trust that no news is good news." 
 
 " Heaven be praised !" ejaculated Mrs. Vernon 
 fervently. '' His Profession is a dangerous one, and 
 I could not help fearing that you might have received 
 some disastrous tidings of him : — that he might have 
 fallen a Victim to those perils to which a Sailor's life 
 is constantly exposed." 
 
 Emily had all this time shrunk back a little space 
 apart from her Aunt, as if she deemed that her pre- 
 sence was not required during the first moments of 
 her Meeting with Arthur ; and perhaps also she was 
 desirous of screening from observation the violence of 
 that emotion she found it impossible to controul. 
 
 When her Cousin turned, however, and gently dis- 
 engaged himself from his Mother, to advance towards 
 her ; she came forward with as much apparent firm- 
 ness as she could contrive to command, and welcomed 
 him upon his arrival.

 Arthur was nearly overset by this, and could scarce- 
 ly find voice to reply, " that grateful as he was to her 
 for the kindness of her expressions, they pierced him 
 to the heart ; since he had the misfortune to feel him- 
 self an ominous Guest, and to wish himself any where 
 but in his actual situation, and under his present cir- 
 cumstances." 
 
 Poor Emily could not become paler than she had 
 been before, but the tears rose to her eyes as she 
 heard these words ; and Mrs. Vernon who appreciated 
 the awkwardness of her position, and remarked that 
 the mutual restraint which she and Ai'thur felt in each 
 other's presence, was growing more and more distres- 
 sing to them both ; proposed that they should all 
 proceed immediately to the House. 
 
 Captain Vernon drew his Mother's arm within one 
 of his, and timidly offered the other to Emily, but she 
 declined it, — saying with an air of embarrassment, 
 "that she would follow them almost directly. — She 
 expected her Father every moment to return from 
 his ride, and she would only wait out of doors to way- 
 lay him, and tell him who had unexpectedly arrived 
 to visit them."

 " N05 no !" cried Arthur, eagerly, and almost 
 thrown off his guard, " let me entreat you not to stay 
 for my Uncle. Not to think of telling him so hastily 
 that I am here." 
 
 Emily looked at her Cousin with much surprise, as 
 she replied, 
 
 " You speak incomprehensibly, and until you are 
 at Hberty to reveal the fearful mystery that hangs 
 over you, 1 will not even try to understand your 
 meaning. As I am unacquainted w^ith your secret 
 however, I trust you will not think me very obstinate 
 and ungracious if I persist in fulfilling my original 
 intention of intercepting my Father and simply in- 
 forming him of the addition he will find in our Party." 
 
 " You never can be either obstinate or ungracious," 
 said Arthur, " but" 
 
 " It is not fair to set her the example," interrupted 
 Mrs. Vernon, as she hurried her Son away, in defiance 
 of his visible reluctance to leave his Cousin. As soon 
 as they were out of Emily's hearing, he observed, 
 " Poor Thing ! I had not the courage to tell her that 
 I was sent here by her Brother; or to break to her 
 that he is dangerously ill,"

 " If that is the case," answered Mrs. Vernon, " Why 
 do you not seek the earHest opportunity of communi- 
 cating your iutellig-ence to your Uncle ? Not an in- 
 stant ought to be lost." 
 
 " I wish to prepare him gradually to expect the 
 sad affliction which I am afraid awaits him ; and in 
 William's present situation, I believe that the delay 
 of a few hours can make no possible difference." 
 
 Mrs. Vernon began indistinctly to suspect that her 
 Nephew's death had already taken place. 
 
 " This blow," she said, " will fall heavily indeed 
 upon my poor Brother ! It comes too before he has 
 yet had time to recover the keenly distressing shock 
 of Julia's Elopement and undutiful conduct." 
 
 While Arthur was shut up with his Father, Mrs. 
 Vernon explained her apprehensions to Louisa and 
 Emily, and they were soon fully confirmed to her by 
 her Husband ; but although he informed her of Mr. 
 Shirley's fate, it was many days before she was made 
 aware of the accumulated horrors that had attended it. 
 
 It would be vain to describe the anguish Sir Wil- 
 liam Shirley and Emily suffered under an affliction,

 which considered in every point of view, appeared to 
 them to be ahnost unparalleled in bitterness. The 
 Baronet was at first quite frantic, but the kindness of 
 his excellent and judicious Relations, and above all 
 the gentle and affectionate attentions of his Daughter, 
 (who seemed to forget her own grief in her anxious 
 solicitude to soften his,) — at length restored him to a 
 state of comparative calmness and composure. He 
 even expressed a parental desire to know what was 
 become of the unhappy Julia, and to learn how she 
 had borne the dreadful weight of misery she had 
 brought down upon herself and all her Family ? 
 
 Arthur staid only one day in Devonshire. He 
 pleaded the necessity of his immediate return to his 
 Quarters to obtain an extension of Leave, as he had 
 offered to undertake and superintend all the arrange- 
 ments preparatory to his Cousin's Funeral. 
 
 Sir William wished his Son to be inteiTed amongst 
 his Ancestors at Greyfield, and determined to attend 
 the last sad Ceremony in person; but Mr. Vernon, 
 who proposed to accompany him upon that melancholy 
 occasion,— persuaded him only to go down into the

 North just time enough to join the Funeral Procession 
 during the last Stage of its long Journey. — 
 
 He made no endeavour to induce him to give up 
 his intention altogether, — for painful and disti*essing 
 as he was aware such a trial must prove to him ; he 
 justly thought that after it was once over, he might 
 feel a degree of satisfaction in reflecting that he had 
 not shrunk from going through it.

 Adelaide Fauconberg was very much overcome 
 when she heard of the death of Mr. Shirley. Under 
 any circumstances she would have been extremely 
 sorry to learn that he had been so suddenly cut off 
 from the world, but there was something peculiarly 
 hoiTible in the idea of his having fallen by the hand 
 of his Brother-in-Law. Perhaps too, when she con- 
 sidered that that Brother-in-Law was Colonel Alger-

 noil, she was even more affected than she would 
 otherwise have been ; it seemed to her imagination 
 that this shocking Event was strikingly and myste- 
 riously connected with her own concerns ; and that 
 the fatal History of Donna Basilia de Lerma, which 
 William had taken so much pains to investigate for 
 the unworthy purpose of slandering Henry Algernon's 
 chai'acter, had been the secret cause of the immo- 
 derate indignation he had expressed when his Sister's 
 Marriage became known to him, — and also of the 
 unrelenting vengeance with which he had pursued 
 Horace afterwards. 
 
 She was too well aware that Mr. Shirley was de- 
 void of principle himself; and she could not there- 
 fore believe that he could be very deeply grieved 
 by that deficiency in another, — or that it was any 
 thing in Colonel Algernon's general character, (in- 
 different as that was,) or in his own slight previous 
 acquaintance with him, — that could have rendered 
 him so particularly an object of his hatred. 
 
 ' No, no ;' fancied she, ' he had long taught him- 
 self to look upon him as the Murderer of his first

 Wife, and it was natural enough that he could not 
 endure the thought of Julia's having united herself to 
 a Person whose hand was stained with the guilt of so 
 dreadful a crime. Alas, when we allow ourselves to 
 deviate from the right path, how difficult do we find 
 it to retrace our steps ; and when we are tempted to 
 commit one fault how little do we foresee into how 
 jnany others it may lead us, or how dreadful may he 
 the punishment we are preparing to draw down 
 upon our own heads I' 
 
 This had been too fearfully verified in the speedy 
 and remarkable retribution which had followed Julia 
 Algernon's undutiful behaviour. Adelaide had been 
 very sincerely concerned when she received the in- 
 telligence of her flight, and had grieved for the dis- 
 tress she was sure it must occasion both Emily and 
 Sir William ; but her deepest pity was now trans- 
 ferred from them, to the unhappy Author of their 
 complicated misery, — and she could not hear even to 
 think what must be the hopeless wretchedness of her 
 present feelings and reflections. 
 
 Adelaide's own strength had been considerably

 improved ; Sir George and Lady Fauconberg talked 
 of removing to London, and she vi^as looking forward 
 with much satisfaction to the prospect of meeting her 
 Friend Emily there, — when the melancholy tidings of 
 Mr. Shirley's fate were conveyed to the North. Her 
 neiTes had previously been so shattered in various 
 ways, that her health was for a time much affected by 
 the shock it gave her, — and her IMother consequently 
 proposed that they should all remain in the Country 
 a little while longer than they had intended. 
 
 As soon as Sir George Fauconberg learnt that Mr. 
 Shirley v^^as to be buried at Greyfield, and that his Fa- 
 ther was to come down upon that occasion; he hesitated 
 upon the propriety of his offering, (through William 
 Vernon,) to join the melancholy Procession ; and per- 
 haps it was the consciousness of the secret injury he 
 had sustained from William, which at last decided 
 him to do so. 
 
 Many painful recollections induced Sir William to 
 wish to decline meeting his Neighbour during so try- 
 ing a scene, yet he felt the kindness of the proposal, 
 and he accepted it the more readily because it was a

 mark of respect to his Memory which he was sure 
 would have been gratifying to his Son could he have 
 been himself aware of it. 
 
 Colonel Algernon in his hurried Letter to Lord Al- 
 tamont, had earnestly requested him to write to him 
 at Paris ; thither it was his intention immediately to 
 proceed, — and until his Grandfather's answer reached 
 him, he felt that he could not arrange any plans for 
 the future. — Indeed he was still in such a state of 
 agitation, that he was unable to think collectedly 
 upon any subject. 
 
 Julia had scarcely spoken, and had taken little no- 
 tice of any thing during the passage ; but after they 
 landed at Calais she became so alarmingly ill, that 
 it was quite impossible to attempt carrying her fur- 
 ther. Remorse and horror had been preying upon 
 her mind until her senses had become completely de- 
 ranged, and when her Husband tried to talk to her 
 and to soothe her, her only answers were the ravings 
 of a Maniac. 
 
 Horace was unwilling to call in the assistance of 
 Strangers or to allow any one but himself to witness

 her sufferings, but the violence of her disorder en- 
 creased so rapidly that he was at length obhged to 
 seek the aid of Medical Advice. 
 
 Mr. Jerningham had fortunately discovered that 
 there was an English Physician at that moment at the 
 same Inn as themselves ; he was a Young Man who 
 had been travelling with a Family of Distinction, and 
 as they were to remain some little time at Paris, his 
 Services were no longer required, and he had left 
 them to return home. ^ 
 
 Mr. Jerningham immediately introduced himself 
 to his Countryman ; he found he had already heard 
 from the Waiter, ' that a poor English Lady had 
 been attacked by a sudden fit of insanity, and was 
 shut up in a room apart from the other Strangers, 
 where she was tearing her hair and uttering shrieks 
 and cries that were doleful and terrible to listen to.' 
 
 A. few words of explanation, gave the Medical Man 
 a clearer idea of Julia's Malady than all the French- 
 man's high-flown descriptions, and he requested to be 
 conducted to her apartment without loss of time. 
 
 He found her in such a state of phrensy that it was

 170 ADELAIDE. 
 
 necessary to subject her to restraint, but he hoped that 
 by bleeding her severely and cutting off her hair, he 
 might be able to reduce the fever upon her brain, and 
 restore her to herself. He patiently watched the 
 effect of his remedies during the whole night, and it 
 was probably to his skill and attention that she was 
 principally indebted for the preservation of her life, 
 as she certainly was for the return of her reason. 
 
 It was a painful and distressing task for Horace to 
 sit hour after hour, and hear her in the presence of a 
 third person, speak of things which related solely to 
 their own private concerns, or which he had good rea- 
 son to wish particularly to keep concealed. Yet if he 
 attempted to move for an instant from her bed side, her 
 agitation was excessive; she seemed impressed with 
 an idea that he intended to desert her, and that i^4^ 
 once left her he never would return. 
 
 Sometimes in her delirium she called for her Bro- 
 ther, and talked to him as if she imagined him to be 
 still alive ; retracing in her conversation, many little 
 circumstances which had endeared them to each other 
 in their childish days. — ^Then she suddenly started off

 ADELAIDE. 171 
 
 into another strain, and deplored his death in the 
 wildest accents of despair ; accusing herself of having 
 been his Murderess. 
 
 She raved about her Father, — her Sister ; — eulo- 
 gised their kindness to her, and condemned herself as 
 an undutiful Daughter, a INIonster of ingratitude ! — In 
 short though she did not utter one w^ord of censure 
 against her Husband ; her bitter lamentations, as well 
 as many of the truths she unconsciously forced upon 
 him, pierced like daggers to his heart. 
 
 Towards morning a Crisis seemed to take place in 
 her Complaint. After many minutes of encreased 
 wildness and desperation, she gradually became more 
 composed; by slow degrees the wandering of her mind 
 grew less perceptible, her recollection began to come 
 ])ack to her, and at last she appeared to be like a 
 Person who has just wakened from a fearful dream. 
 
 The Physician remained at Calais for more than a 
 week, as Horace had little difficulty in persuading 
 him not to leave his Patient as long as he considered 
 that there was any danger of her having a relaps e of 
 the Malady upon her brain. He had gained an

 ascendancy o^er her too, whicli was happily exert- 
 ed in endeavouring to reconcile her to her situation ; 
 and she made him promise that when he returned 
 to England, he would enquire how her Family had 
 borne their affliction, and send her any tidings he 
 might be able to procure of them. 
 
 As it was essentially necessary that Julia should be 
 kept perfectly quiet, it had now become out of the 
 question to think of removing her to Paris, and Ho- 
 race discovered a retired little Chateau where he de- 
 cided that they should establish themselves for the 
 present. 
 
 He had written again to Lord Altamont, a few 
 days after he arrived in France, and in due course of 
 time he received an answer from his Grandfather, in 
 which he told him, ' that deeply as he had himself 
 been distressed by the afflicting information contained 
 in both his Letters, he should forbear to aggravate the 
 evils of his fate by useless reproaches; — since his vio- 
 lent and unjustifiable conduct had brought with it its 
 own punishment, and had rendered both him and his 
 mihappy Wife, the objects of his sincere commisera- 
 tion.*

 ADELAIDE. 173 
 
 He said, ' that as circumstances would now probably 
 induce them to continue Abroad, — at least for some 
 time ; he should make immediate arrangements to 
 settle upon them such an allowance as would enable 
 them to live comfortably but not expensively;' and 
 he added ' that the sum he intended to allot to them 
 should be transmitted to them regularly every half 
 year.' — ^He expressed many good wishes for the re- 
 storation of Mrs. Algernon's health, and requested to 
 hear again from Horace whenever his future move- 
 ments might be decided. 
 
 This Jjetter was perhaps even a kinder and more 
 indulgent one than Colonel Algernon had any right 
 to expect, yet he was grievously disappointed with 
 it ; or more properly speaking, it opened his eyes to 
 his actual situation, and showed the dreary change 
 that had overclouded all his prospects. 
 
 It has been already observed that he had grown 
 tired of a wandering existence, and that he had lat- 
 terly began to look forward with complacency to the 
 comfort and respectabihty that might be hoped for 
 in an establishment in his native Country; not to 
 mention the brighter perspective that sometimes rose

 174 ADELAIDE. 
 
 before his imagination, when he recollected that in 
 the course of a very few years, he must inevitably be 
 the Successor to an Ancient Title and a rich Inheri- 
 tance. 
 
 His unfortunate Duel with Mr. Shirley, had at 
 once destroyed these agreable Visions. He was 
 again reduced to the condition of an Emigrant, 
 almost of an Outlaw. His means would be too 
 limited to permit him to indulge his favorite passion 
 lor Play, or to enter into any expensive amusements ; 
 and to complete his distress and mortification, the 
 Wife to whom his fate was indissolubly united, was 
 no longer the lively, entertaining Companion he had 
 formerly found her ; but a melancholy, broken-heart- 
 ed Invalid whom he could only regard with feelings 
 of compassion and regret. 
 
 Julia had not failed to observe with deep concern . 
 the etFect which Lord Altamont's Lettei' had produced 
 upon her Husband's mind; and though she did not 
 venture to remark it to him, she probably suspected 
 what must be the nature of his present sentiments to- 
 wards herself. Upon that point she was pecuharly

 ADELAIDE. 175 
 
 sensitive, and as^uick-sighted as ever ; but in other 
 respects she was much altered. Her mind had been 
 so much shaken by the sudden and appaUing cala- 
 mity which had burst like a thunderbolt upon her, — 
 that although her intellect was apparently restored, 
 it never entirely recovered the shock it had then 
 received. She became subject to long fits of gloom 
 and melancholy, and in the intervals between these — 
 her manner was often singularly wild and flighty. 
 The keen wit, and acuteness of perception which had 
 first captivated Horace's fancy, had entirely forsaken 
 her, or only visited her by unequal starts; and in 
 general gave place to a sort of childishness and 
 inquietude of Spirit, which were alike wearing to 
 herself and tiresome to her Friends. 
 
 Julia had heard from the Physician who had at- 
 tended her at Calais, that Captain Vernon had been 
 summoned to comfort her Brother during his last mo- 
 ments : and that he had afterwards gone into Devon- 
 shire to break to his Family the intelhgence of what 
 had happened. 
 
 She did not venture to communicate to her Hus-

 band the intense anxiety she felt to learn how her 
 Relations had borne the afflicting news. She dared 
 not write to her Father, — and she knew not how to 
 address herself even to Emily ; but she determined to 
 appeal to Arthur's kindness, and to request him to 
 take pity upon her misery, and to send her the infor- 
 mation she was so desirous to obtain. 
 
 He was sincerely touched when he received his 
 Cousin's Letter, and he lost no time in attempting to 
 satisfy her natural curiosity, and in endeavouring to 
 do so in a manner best calculated to give her all the 
 consolation in his power. He told her ' that both Sir 
 William and her Sister were quite as well as their 
 Friends could expect them to be. That they had of 
 course abandoned their intention of going to J|Cndon 
 in the Spring : and that they had p^mised they 
 would, when they left Devonshire, accompany his 
 Father and Mother to tt|;feir Home.' He said ' he 
 suspected that the whole Party would remove from 
 thence to Greyfield later in the year, but that that 
 point was not finally settled, — and at all events his own 
 Family could only pay a short visit to the North as it

 would not be prudent for his Mother to remain there 
 after the warm weather was over.' — He assured Juha 
 that her Father, far from feehng inexorable resent- 
 ment towards her, had been softened by her misfor- 
 tunes, and had frequently spoken of her with interest 
 and compassion. And he earnestly recommended her 
 to write him a penitent Letter ; as he said ' he thought 
 if she were to implore his forgiveness, Sir William 
 would not now be disinclined to grant it to her.' He 
 concluded, by reminding her ' that if she took his 
 advice, she would be sure of having in her Sister, a 
 kind and powerful Advocate to plead her Cause with 
 her offended Parent.' 
 
 Julia wept bitterly when she read this Letter, — but 
 much as she longed to adopt the course Arthur pro- 
 posed to her, she had not the courage to do so. She 
 feared that Horace might disapprove of her making 
 any concessions to her Family ; or that his pride 
 might be offended if her Overtures towards a recon- 
 ciliation, were either rejected altogether or received 
 ungraciously. She was haunted with an almost child- 
 ish dread of taking any step that might lower her in

 her Husband's affection : — And she put off writing to 
 Sir William from day to day, — until at length she 
 persuaded herself that it was too late to think of wri- 
 ting to him at all. 
 
 Meanwhile Horace had become weary of the mono- 
 tony of his secluded Chateau ; the purpose for which 
 he had taken it was answered, and as solitude was no 
 longer peculiarly desirable for Julia, he began to feel 
 the expediency of considering in what part of the 
 world they should next fix their abode. He was little 
 inclined to establish himself permanently in France : 
 his imagination wandered towards Italy, and he pro- 
 posed to his Wife that they should proceed in that 
 direction. He said, ' it would not be necessary to 
 settle themselves in any one place ; as they might find 
 it more amusing to visit all the princij|id**<Sfces in 
 turn, and lo remain at each just as many weeks or 
 months as they might think it agreable to do so.' In 
 this way he promised to show her, without fatigue, 
 every thing best worth seeing in that beautiful and 
 interesting Country ; and he secretly hoped that con- 
 stant variety, and frequent change of scene, would be

 of much service in restoring" her spirits, and assisting 
 to banish painful images from her recollection. 
 
 Julia listened to this plan with a sort of passive 
 indifference which showed how little satisfaction she 
 expected to derive from any alteration of place ; — yet 
 she expressed her approbation of all Horace's pro- 
 jected an-angements merely because he had devised 
 them. 
 
 Lord Altamont, to whom he next announced his 
 scheme, was much more cordially encouraging ; he 
 wrote his Grandson word that he thought his decision 
 a very judicious one, and that he advised him to lose 
 no time in putting it into execution ; — adding sundry 
 other admonitions and good wishes, which it is unne- 
 cessary to repeat, since they were very soon forgotten 
 by the person to whom they were addressed. 
 
 Colonel and Mrs. Algernon had not many prepara- 
 tions to make for their Journey ; a seasonable remit- 
 tance from Lord Altamont, facilitated their departure 
 from the temporary Residence they had chosen ; and 
 they set out on their route towards Italy, having deter- 
 mined to make Geneva a resting place in the first

 instance. And there we will leave them for the present, 
 while we return to Devonshire. 
 
 After the first transports of Sir William Shirlej^'s 
 g-rief had subsided, he bore his affliction with such 
 unshaken fortitude that those who were but slightly 
 acquainted with him, perceived little difference either 
 in his appearance or in his manner ; yet to the Friends 
 who knew him intimately, it was evident that he was 
 subdued in character and broken in spirit. His affec- 
 tion and solicitude seemed to be principally centered 
 in his Daughter Emily; his delight in her society, 
 and his anxious desire to promote her comfort and 
 happiness, appeared to encrease every day; and it 
 nmst be confessed that she had merited by her ami- 
 able and exemplary conduct to be thus beloved. 
 
 One morning when the Young Ladies were gone 
 out walking, and the Baronet was left alone with Mrs. 
 N'emon, he said to her, 
 
 " I have been thinking, Louisa, that Arthur has 
 been a long while a Captain, and that it is now high 
 time he should get on in his Profession, — as I am sure 
 he is well qualified to do. 1 have latterly learnt to

 consider him so exactly in the light of my own Son, 
 that I have written to him to mention my desire to be 
 allowed to purchase him a step of rank ; and as I am 
 not very conversant with the routine of military ar- 
 rangements, J have requested him to put me in the 
 way of setting about this in the form that will be 
 most agreable and advantageous to himself." 
 
 Mrs. Vernon expressed her gratitude very warmly 
 to her Brother for the kindness of his intentions to- 
 wards her Son. 
 
 " We certainly do not possess the means," added 
 she, *• to forward his advancement in the Army as 
 you have generously proposed to do ; and even if it 
 was in our power, Arthur has so proud and chivalrous 
 a spirit," she smiled as she spoke these words ; " that 
 I am not quite convinced he would consent to accept 
 such assistance." 
 
 " All feelings of pride between him and me," re- 
 plied Sir William, " are now out of the question ; 
 perhaps I ought to plead guilty of having cherished 
 something of that kind rather too long. — I know," he 
 continued, after a pause, " that Military Men cannot

 182 ADELAIDE. 
 
 contrive to be constantly absent from their duty, yet 
 I very much wish to see Arthur : there are a number 
 of weighty and interesting matters that I am ex- 
 tremely anxious to talk over w^ith him, — and I have 
 consequently begged him to come and make us a 
 visit here as soon as he can possibly get leave to 
 do so. When you next write to him, I hope you 
 will not fail to second my petition." 
 
 '' I will readily promise," said Mrs. Vernon, " to 
 obey an injunction so agreable to myself, but I be- 
 lieve it will only be taking unnecessary trouble. 
 Arthur will be happy enough to accept the kind and 
 cordial invitation you have sent him ; and I think I 
 may venture to assure you that no eloquence of mine 
 will be required to persuade him to come here very 
 speedily." 
 
 Sir WilHam began to suspect from his Sister's man- 
 ner, that she was better acquamted with some of his 
 Family Secrets, than he had hitherto imagined ; and 
 this supposition led to an interesting confidential con- 
 versation between them, which proved highly gratify- 
 ing and satisfactory to both : — and would not, there is

 little doubt, have been at all less pleasing, (could they 
 have been aware of it,) to the Parties themselves who 
 were j^rincipally concerned in it. 
 
 Mrs. Vernon was not mistaken when she prophesied 
 that her Son would very hastily obey his Uncle's sum- 
 mons. In about a week after he received it he wrote 
 to Sir William to announce his immediate approach ; 
 he expressed much satisfaction at the prospect of see- 
 ing all his Relations, but added that he was afraid his 
 visit must be a very short one. 
 
 '' Perhaps we may be able to induce him to stay 
 longer the next time," observed the Baronet. " Re- 
 member Emily that as your Cousin is coming- here 
 upon my invitation, he is to be considered as my 
 Guest ; and that it will consequently be Your duty to 
 assist me in the task of entertaining him, and endea- 
 vouring to render his sejour with us as agreable as 
 we can." 
 
 Emily blushed very deeply, but did not attempt to 
 make any reply. Perhaps she would not have found 
 it easy to analyse her feelings at that moment. 
 
 Pleasure, gratitude, hope, and fear were so strange-

 184 ADELAIDE. 
 
 ]y mingled together in her mind, that she scarcely 
 knew whether she ought most to dread or to rejoice 
 at the idea of meeting her Cousin, and of finding her- 
 self again in his society with the consciousness she 
 now possessed that the sentiments she had formerly 
 trembled to avow, were at length sanctioned by her 
 Father's approbation. 
 
 If she had ever flattered herself that Arthur's 
 affection for her was warmer than that of a very 
 iioar Relation ; the circumstances under which they 
 had parted at Greyfield, had more than weakened 
 such an agreable suspicion. The honorable exer- 
 tions he had made to conceal from her the anguish 
 Jie endured at leaving her, had so successfully blind- 
 ed her to the real state of his feelings, — that in spite 
 of all .Julia's hints and insinuations, she became con- 
 vinced that he had only regarded her ^v'ar' Friend 
 or a Sister, and for his sake she tried t"o^ be pleased 
 with this conviction. His subsequent conduct had, 
 it is true, occasionally awakened certain doubts in her 
 mind ; and there had been something in his man- 
 ner towards herself during their last painful meeting.

 which It was equally impossible to describe or to 
 mistake : — Yet after all, this might merely have 
 arisen from a strong and affectionate feeling of sym- 
 patli}- for the misfortune he had come to communi- 
 cate. — She saw that her Father believed Arthur was 
 attached to her, but she feared that his kind partiality 
 towards her had perhaps led him to form this opinion 
 en'oneously ; and she trembled with agony at the 
 probability of his unguardedly betraying to her Cou- 
 sin those thoughts upon the subject, which were evi- 
 dently engrossing much of his own attention. — In 
 short, she was tormented with a thousand secret and 
 distressing anxieties. 
 
 The expected Guest arrived, and if his Sisters per- 
 ceived any unusual degree of emban'assment and 
 timidity in his air when he approached Emily, they 
 attributed the circumstance to his recollection of the 
 afflicting nature of his former Visit ; — and it was the 
 same cause, they also imagined, which occasioned 
 the rapid variation of Emily's colour and the agitated 
 tone of her voice, when she replied to his anxious 
 enquiries about her own and her Father's health.

 Captain Vernon himself was in a state of no ordi- 
 nary excitement. He did not dare to indulge those 
 hopes which the kind summons he had received from 
 his Uncle seemed almost to warrant, and yet he found 
 it beyond his power entirely to repress them. Sir 
 William did not keep him very long* in this uncom- 
 fortable suspense. Even before dinner he contrived 
 to call him aside, and taking him into his own room, 
 began talking to him of his future prospects. 
 
 After mentioning how desirous he was that he 
 should obtain his promotion, the Baronet added ' that 
 he must excuse him if he ventured to touch upon a 
 circumstance which it was natural to suppose might 
 be likely to have some influence upon his views and 
 feelings. — ^To explain himself in a few words, he said 
 that soon after he had left Greyfield, he had had rea- 
 son to suspect that his aifections had become en- 
 gaged.' 
 
 Arthur started violently at this direct attack, but 
 answered firmly and immediately,

 him to ask, — independently of all other considerations. 
 He was therefore ready to plead guilty to the charge 
 of presumption, and to confess that Sir William's sus- 
 picions had been accurately founded." 
 
 '^ Having obtained this frank avowal," replied the 
 Baronet, " You must not think me ungenerous if I 
 press you still further, and request you to tell me if 
 the sentiments you then entertained are yet un- 
 changed ?" 
 
 Arthur's lip quivered as he said, " the attachment 
 which I have never before confided to any one, stole 
 so unconsciously upon me, that I was not aware of 
 its existence until it had become too powerful to be 
 subdued. The instant I discovered the state of my 
 own heart, I tore myself away from the Object of an 
 affection which hopeless as I well know it to be, nei- 
 ther time nor absence can have the slightest effect 
 in diminishing."

 liam, seizing his Nephew's hand, '' this is just what I 
 expected of you. Such behaviour and such constancy

 serves. You are aware that I had formerly other 
 and more ambitious views, and also that those views 
 were defeated. — Since that time all my circumstances 
 have underg-one a sad and melancholy change. Of 
 three Children, I may now say that only one remains 
 to me, — and the future happiness of that matchless 
 Child is the sole interest that still attaches me to this 
 world. I need not tell you that I never have, and 
 never will, attempt to influence Emily's choice ; but 
 if You can succeed in obtaining her affection, it will 
 give me sincere pleasure to bestow upon you her 
 hand. — Remember however," he added with a smile, 
 " that the young Lady who could find in her heart 
 to refuse so great a Man as Lord Stanmore, cannot 
 be very easily won. — Now do not look so wildly, and 
 let me hear no more of gratitude," cried Sir William, 
 as Arthur tried to put into words, what he found it 
 almost impossible to express. 
 
 " It is growing so late that our conversatioii^ust 
 come to an end. I actually hear the Dinner Bell, 
 and the Ladies, not to mention your Father, will 
 think us very uncivil if we keep them long waiting."

 At Dinner Arthur was 23laced beside his Mother, 
 and although the conversation was of course general, 
 it was to her that his attentions was principally direc- 
 ted. He seemed to be in a remarkably happy frame 
 of mind, but it must be confessed that his answers 
 and observations occasionally betrayed a degree of 
 absence, of which, when in a similar neighbourhood, 
 he had never before been guilt} . 
 
 In the evening- he advanced towards the Sofa 
 
 o 
 
 where the young Ladies were seated, and addressing 
 his Sister, requested her to make room for him be- 
 tween Emily and herself. 
 
 '' We are both Emily's," said she with a smile, as 
 she instantly moved to admit him, " and we are now 
 become so completely blended into one Family, that 
 I believe I may venture to add that wa^ both consider 
 ourselves your Sisters." 
 
 This afFeclioiiate and well-intended remark, did 
 not appear to please Arthur ; a cloud passed over his 
 brow, and hy bit his lip as he replied half in joke and 
 half in anger, 
 
 " You and Louisa who have luid the happiness of

 living with Emily as Sisters for many months, may 
 well feel i^roud of Ijeing authorized to consider her as 
 such : — but with me the case is very different. I have 
 never been accustomed to think of her exactly in that 
 light, and I have now little wish to take so bold a 
 step as to accept your challenge, and claim the privi- 
 lege of calling Miss Shirley by that title." Then 
 lowering his voice, and turning towards his Cousin, 
 he continued, — 
 
 " Though I hope it is unnecessary for me to assure 
 her that she is not less dear to me than a Sister. ^^ 
 
 Emily Vernon did not hear this concluding sen- 
 tence, there was something in her Brother's behaviour 
 that puzzled her ; it seemed little less than ungracious 
 to Emily, and she feared that the latter had felt it 
 so, when she perceived that she changed colour and 
 looked much confused. 
 
 Louisa, who was more quick-sighted, began to en- 
 tertain a vague suspicion of the truth, and by alluding 
 to Arthur's long visit at Greyfield, she relieved him 
 from any embarrassment he might have felt at en- 
 tering at once upon that subject.

 He reminded his Cousin of many little circum- 
 stances, and retraced various scenes which had occur- 
 red dmung the period he had spent under his Uncle's 
 roof; and Emily, who had entirely regained her 
 self-possession, at length observed, " that those were 
 indeed happy times, and that it always gave her the 
 greatest pleasure to think of them. — Poor Julia," 
 continued she with a sigh, " How much I shall miss 
 her when I return to Greyfield ! I have not a single 
 recollection of that place which is not associated with 
 her." 
 
 Arthur ventured to enquire if either She or Sir 
 William had ever heard from her Sister? He found 
 they had not, and that her Father had been much 
 hurt by her never having made the slightest attempt 
 to obtain his forgiveness, or taken any sort of notice 
 of him after the heavy affliction she had been the 
 means of drawing down upon him. 
 
 " Culpable as Julia has been," said her Cousin, 
 " I have good reason to know that this last apparent 
 neglect, arose rather from false shame than from any 
 heartless want of natural affection."

 He then mentioned the Letter he had himself re- 
 ceived from her, and the advice he had given her in 
 his answer. 
 
 Emily was much surprised and relieved at gaining 
 such direct intelligence of her Sister, and upon this 
 foundation she immediately grounded a hope of being 
 able to effect a reconciliation between her and her 
 Father. 
 
 The evening passed rapidly away, and long before 
 its conclusion Miss Shirley felt an agreable persuasion 
 that she need never have tormented herself with any 
 apprehension of not having been beloved by her 
 Cousin. 
 
 The following morning Arthur imparted the secret 
 of his attachment to his favorite Sister Louisa, and 
 by taking away Emily she contrived to pr(5^re,J|^^ 
 the tete-a-tete he so much wished for with his Cousin. 
 He lost no time in pleading the warmth of that affec- 
 tion, which he said ' he had hitherto felt it an impe- 
 rious duty studiously to conceal;' and he was more 
 than recompensed for all the distress he had suffered, 
 by hearing Emily confess ' that as the sentiments he

 had just avowed — had been mutual, the trial he de- 
 scribed that he had endured for her sake had in 
 some degree been mutual also.' 
 
 There was so much on both sides to talk over and 
 to explain, that the Tale was still half untold when 
 Louisa came to summon the conscious Pair to Lun- 
 cheon. 
 
 It is unnecessary to add that Sir William Shirley 
 readily confirmed the sanction he had already given 
 to Arthur's hopes, and that He and Emily soon re- 
 ceived the blessings and congratulations of all the 
 Party. — Xo Union ever seemed to promise a fairer 
 prospect of happiness to the Individuals principally 
 concerned, or could possibly afford more complete 
 satisfaction to every body connected with them ; and 
 l^mily Vernon laughed heartily at her own stupidity 
 in havinp; imao^ined that her Brother felt some unac- 
 countable aversion for his Cousin. 
 
 It was not until after every thing was settled, that 
 Arthur delicately informed his Uncle that poor Wil- 
 liam had, during his last moments, foretold the pro- 
 babihty of his Alliance with Emily, and had expressed 
 a very kind wish that it might eventually take place.

 Sir William Shirley was very desirous that Captain 
 and Mrs. Arthur Vernon should spend the greatest 
 part of their time at Greyfield, even if they thought 
 it expedient to have some nominal home of their own; 
 and to this proposal, Arthur was extremely willing to 
 assent. Indeed, circumstanced as the Baronet now 
 was, he would not for an instant have meditated the 
 selfish cruelty of separating him entirely from the 
 only remaining comfort of his Hfe. 
 
 Our Hero had formerly been much devoted to his 
 Profession, but in quiet times, — and perhaps since his 
 acquaintance with his Cousin, — he had g|««wn tired of 
 the uniform routine of Military Duty ; and he felt no 
 reluctance at the idea of giving up, at least for the 
 present, what had become no longer interesting to 
 him. 
 
 It was agreed that his Uncle should purchase him 
 a Majority as soon as possible, and that he should 
 then go upon Half Pay ; an arrangement that might 
 enable him to return to the Service at any future pe- 
 riod, when the prospect of more active employment 
 held out an inducement to encourage him to wish to 
 do so.

 As his Marriage was to be deferred until his affairs 
 at the Horse Guards were finally concluded, it was 
 judged that it would be more agreable for both par- 
 ties that their Engagement should not as yet be pub- 
 licly declared ; but it was confidentially communicated 
 to their particular Friends, and among these of course 
 to Adelaide Fauconberg, who sympathised most warm- 
 ly in Emily's happiness. 
 
 Arthur wrote a very kind Letter to Julia ; he did 
 not tell her that this measure had received Sir Wil- 
 liam's concurrence, but he said he was commissioned 
 by her Sister to give her her best love, accompanied 
 by an assurance of her continued affection ; and he 
 exhorted her not to neglect the opportunity afforded 
 her by the Event that v/as about to take place in her 
 Family, of endeavouring to open an amicable com- 
 munication with her Father.

 The Spring was already far advanced when Co- 
 lonel Henry Algernon landed in England. The 
 first News that greeted him upon his arrival, was his 
 Cousin Horace's Marriage, and the dreadful Story 
 of Mr. Shirley's fate. The former intelligence sur- 
 prised him not a little, and the Catastrophe which 
 had followed it, shocked him excessively. Had his 
 Rival died a natural death, it is not to be supposed that 
 he would personally have regretted him, but as it 
 was, he could not think of his decease without horror, 
 and he felt an anxious desire to know how Adelaide 
 had been affected by so unlooked for, and appaUing 
 an event.

 had reached Henry in the West Indies, and had 
 occasioned him the most agonizing distress of mind. 
 
 Something he had afterwards indistinctly heard of 
 the Wedding having been suddenly put off in conse- 
 quence of the dangerous illness of the Bride ; — but all 
 that he had been able to ascertain with any certainty, 
 was that her Engagement with Mr. Shirley had been 
 either delayed for a time, or brought entirely to an end. 
 He was much inclined to suspect that Adelaide never 
 could bring herself to like William as a Husband, 
 but he knew how ardently Lady Fauconberg advo- 
 cated the Alliance ; and he always imagined that she 
 would at length succeed in persuading her Daughter 
 to enter into it. 
 
 It may easily be supposed that Colonel Henry Al- 
 gernon repaired with as little delay as possible to 
 Altamont Castle. He found his Grandfather shaken 
 in health and depressed in spirits by the distress he 
 had recently suffered upon Horace's account ; and he 
 rejoiced that he had himself returned to his Native 
 Country at a moment when his presence and Society 
 might prove peculiarly useful to the poor old Peer.

 He endeavoured by every means in his power to 
 comfort and cheer him, and he had soon the pleasure 
 of observing that his efforts were not entirely unsuc- 
 cessful. 
 
 Meanwhile his thoughts frequently turned upon 
 his own future prospects, and these only seemed to 
 present a melancholy and cheerless blank. 
 
 All hope of domestic happiness had abandoned 
 him when he took leave of Fauconberg Manor. The 
 perspective afforded by the expectation of wandering 
 from year to year with a Marching Regiment, in 
 time of Peace, from one dull Country Quarter to 
 another ; was so little in unison with any of his for- 
 mer habits and ideas, that he could not look forward 
 to it without disgust. — To give up his profession en- 
 tirely, appeared out of the question. He was not 
 attached by any permanent tie to place or Country, 
 and he began to consider why he might not be quah-^ 
 fied to fill some little Diplomatic Situation Abroad, 
 could such be procured for him by his Family in- 
 terest. 
 
 Lord Altamont had arrangements to make and

 business to conclude relative to Horace's affairs, 
 which obliged him to go for a short time to London ; 
 and thither it was agi*eed that Henry should accom- 
 pany him. He had not yet ventured to mention his 
 crude and undecided plans to his Grandfather, but 
 he determined that he would speak to him about 
 them during this journey, and ask him for his coun- 
 sel and advice upon a subject so interesting to them 
 both. 
 
 When the two Algernons first came back from the 
 Peninsular, Lord Altamont resolved to add the Por- 
 traits of his handsome Grandsons to his large collec- 
 tion of Family Pictures at Altamont Castle, and he 
 accordingly had them taken by one of the most cele- 
 brated Artists in London. They were both good 
 likenesses, — that of Horace in particular was a very 
 highly finished painting, and much study had been 
 bestowed by the Original upon endeavouring to ren- 
 der the Costume as becoming as possible. In those 
 days he knew and cared very little about Works of 
 Art, he considered the sittings a great bore, — ^but as 
 his resemblance was to be handed down to posterity.

 he wished that it should appear to the best advan- 
 tage. 
 
 During his sejour afterwards in Italy however, he 
 acquired a taste for Pictures ; he learnt to understand 
 them^ and to become a judge of their merits and of 
 their defects; and when he looked again at his own 
 Portrait the last time he visited Altamont Castle, he dis- 
 covered that in his anxiety to display the full splendour 
 of a brilliant Uniform, he had insisted upon making 
 the colouring of the Picture too gaudy, and had given 
 it something of the effect of a flaming Figure upon 
 a Sign Post ; — at least it reminded him disagreably 
 of that sort of representation. — The Artist had hinted 
 this objection and had remonstrated against the Dress 
 Horace had chosen, but his arguments were over- 
 ruled, and he was obliged to give up the point to him 
 who would never submit to be guided by any opinion 
 but his own. 
 
 It now occurred to Colonel Algernon that by 
 introducing a Mihtary Cloak and a little additional 
 shade, his original mistake might very easily be rec- 
 tified. He often talked of this idea to Lord Altamont,

 ADELAIDE. 201 
 
 and as he could not bear to see his Picture in its pre- 
 sent state, he declared that he should take the earliest 
 opportunity of requesting the Person who had painted 
 it to reconsider his work, and put the proposed im- 
 provement into execution. 
 
 Before Lord Altamont now left home, he suggested 
 to Henry that the Portrait should be taken down, and 
 that the alteration Horace had been so extremely de- 
 sirous to have carried into effect, should if possible be 
 made under their joint superintendance while they 
 remained in London. 
 
 Accordingly a few days after their arrival in Town, 
 they called upon the Artist by appointment; the 
 Portrait had been previously sent to his House, and 
 Lord Altamont delicately reminded him of his for- 
 mer ineffectual remonstrance against the taste of the 
 Costume. He added, " that his Grandson's judge- 
 ment in such matters had become more correct ; that 
 he perceived the error he had fallen into; and was 
 anxious that so fine a specimen of Art, should be ren- 
 dered more perfect by undergoing a sHght change, 
 and being finished in conformity to the first design of 
 him who had so ably executed it."

 He then hinted those alterations which Horace 
 himself had so frequently explained to him. 
 
 The Painter agreed at once to the justice of a cri- 
 tique which had in fact been his own. He imme- 
 diately described the improvements which he thought 
 might judiciously and advantageously be made, and 
 which were also in accordance with what he under- 
 stood to be the wish of the Original ; and he promised 
 to set about them without delay. The Picture was 
 considered one of his best performances, but it had 
 never quite satisfied him, though his endeavours to do 
 justice to so handsome a Study had cost him no ordi- 
 nary labour ; and he was consequently much pleased 
 at being allowed to remove those blemishes which had 
 hitherto marred its perfection. 
 
 The Walls of the Room in which he received his 
 Guests, were nearly covered with finished and unfi- 
 nished Paintings, while others in various stages of 
 progress were confusedly grouped in different corners. 
 
 Henry was examining some of these, when Lord 
 Altamont entered a small inner apartment, (the Artist's 
 painting Closet,) where a Single Picture, — the v/ork 
 upon which he was just then engaged, stood conspi-

 cuous upon his Easel. The old Peer looked at it for 
 some time, and then said, 
 
 " May I venture to enquire the name of that very 
 pretty and interesting looking* young Lady ?" 
 
 " It is Miss Fauconberg, my Lord," replied the 
 Painter, " The Daughter of Sir George Fauconberg. 
 She is indeed very interesting. She is an only Child, 
 and as she has it seems been long in bad health, her 
 Parents appear very uneasy about her. From a con- 
 versation I had a few days ago with her Father, I 
 imagine that they have some intention of taking her 
 to the South of France. — Whenever I work at that 
 Picture, I cannot help feeling a melancholy forebo- 
 ding that the Original will not very long sur\ive its 
 completion." 
 
 The name of Miss Fauconberg caught Henry's 
 ear, he darted forward to obtain a view of her resem- 
 blance, and Ustened with mingled grief and alarm to 
 the fearful account that had just been given of her 
 health. 
 
 j " The features are certainly extremely like" ob- 
 served he at length in a sort of Soliloquy, " but 
 
 , she must be very sadly altered I"

 " You are acquainted then with Miss Faucon- 
 berg ?" said the Artist, who had observed with some 
 surprise the intense and melancholy interest with 
 which he had gazed upon the Picture. 
 
 '' I knew her formerly, but I have not seen her for 
 several years. — From what I have now heard, I sup- 
 pose she is at present in Town." 
 
 " She is. She is coming here this morning to give 
 me her last sitting." 
 
 Before these words were concluded, a loud knock 
 at the entrance door announced the approach of Visi- 
 tors, and a moment afterwards their footsteps were 
 heard in the adjoining Room. The Artist looked at 
 his Watch. 
 
 " Excuse me, my Lord," said he, " it is much later 
 than I imagined, and you are aware that my time is 
 not at my own disposal. I am afraid Lady Faucon- 
 berg and her Daughter are arrived." 
 
 " Pray make no apologies," replied Lord Altamont, 
 " We ought to be ashamed of om'selves for having 
 intruded upon you so long. We will here wish you 
 good morning, and remain, if you will allow us, in

 the next Room until my Carriage comes up to the 
 door." 
 
 The Painter rung the bell to desire that it might be 
 called ; " I will not leave you alone," said he with a 
 smile ; " They are silent Companions to be sure, but 
 you will find many of your Friends amongst the can- 
 vass upon those walk." 
 
 Meanwhile Henry Algernon seemed perfectly elec- 
 trified by thus unexpectedly finding himself under 
 the same roof, and almost in the presence of her 
 whom he most wished and yet most dreaded to meet. 
 For an instant he stood irresolute, and his eye glanced 
 quickly round the little Apartment as if he was desi- 
 rous to discover if it might not be possible to effect 
 his escape without being obliged to pass through the 
 larger one where the Ladies were waiting; but the 
 only egress from the Closet, was through the door 
 by which he had entered it : and as it was lit by a 
 sky-fight, it did not afford him even the desperate 
 option of breaking his neck by jumping out of a 
 window. — No alternative was left him but to come 
 forward with as much apparent indifference as he

 could assume ; and considering tlie circumstances 
 under which Adelaide and he had parted, — he did so 
 with a very uncomfortable feeling of uncertainty as 
 to the probability of being simply acknowledged as 
 a former Acquaintance, or studiously disregarded as 
 an entire Stranger. 
 
 Colonel Algernon's Picture had been placed in a 
 prominent situation in the outer Room, it was also a 
 new feature there, and as such it had naturally at- 
 tracted Miss Fauconberg's attention. She was much 
 startled by its likeness to Henry, and at first she ima- 
 gined it must have been intended for him ; — but upon 
 examining it more closely, she perceived her mistake, 
 and easily guessed who had been the real Original. 
 She became so deeply engrossed in contemplating 
 this Portrait, that she was not aware any body had 
 come into the room, until she was roused by a half 
 suppressed exclamation of Lady Fauconberg's and by 
 hearing the voice of the Artist just behind her. She 
 turned round hastily to speak to him, half ashamed of 
 the absence into which she had been betrayed, — and 
 in so doing her eyes met those of Henry Algernon,

 She knew that he had arrived in England, but she 
 had heard nothing of him since his return, and the 
 surprise of seeing him thus unexpectedly^, quite over- 
 came her; she turned pale, a sort of hysterical scream 
 burst from her lips, and she fainted. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg's arm saved Adelaide from fall- 
 ing, and she gladly accepted Colonel Algernon's as- 
 sistance in supporting her apparently lifeless Form to 
 the nearest chair. With her usual presence of mind, 
 she then said aloud, 
 
 " My Daughter is in very delicate health, and she 
 has latterly been much subject to these kind of ner- 
 vous attacks. They are very distressing while they 
 last, and may appear alarming to those who have not 
 been accustomed to witness them ; but they do not 
 really afford any cause for uneasiness, and they gene- 
 rally prove of very short duration." 
 
 Then lowering her voice, and addressing herself 
 peculiarly to Henry, she added, 
 
 " You need not look so terrified, — I assure you 
 she will very soon be better." 
 
 The Painter who had ran to fetch a glass of water,

 now returned and presented it to Lady Fauconberg" ; 
 she sprinkled a few drops in her Daughter's face, 
 observing " that she would be very glad to take a 
 little more of it when she began to revive. — Per- 
 haps Colonel Algernon," she continued, " you will 
 have the goodness to ask for my Carriage. — As I fear 
 that Adelaide will not be well enough to sit for her 
 Picture this morning, I believe the wisest thing I can 
 do will he to take her home as soon as possible. 
 After she has had one of these affections, I always 
 contrive to keep her quite quiet for a few hours. It 
 is most desirable, when she first comes to herself that 
 no object should attract her attention that can be 
 likely to distress her or to agitate her Spirits." 
 
 Henry could neither misunderstand this hint or 
 refuse to obey it, but while he stole a last glance of 
 those pale features which he imagined he was des- 
 tined never to behold again, — Adelaide opened her 
 eyes. She seemed half unconscious where she was, 
 or what had happened to her ? but some sort of con- 
 fused recollection of the past was evidently floating in 
 her mind, for she indistinctly pronounced the name of 
 " Henry."

 The command which Colonel Algernon had hitherto 
 maintained over his feelings, now gave way at once, 
 and forgetting every thing in the violence of his long 
 smothered affection, he threw himself upon his knees 
 before Miss Fauconberg, and seizing her hand, — pas- 
 sionately exclaimed, 
 
 " Adelaide, dearest Adelaide, speak to me once 
 again. Let me hear you tell me, I beseech you, 
 that my unfortunate appearance, — my unwelcome 
 presence, — have not quite killed You." 
 
 " Colonel Algernon," cried Lady Fauconberg, 
 " this is really insufferable. I say nothing of the 
 exposure you have thought proper to make, since 
 its absurdity rests entirely upon Yourself. But it 
 becomes my duty to warn you that the health of 
 my Child, perhaps even her Li/e," and she laid 
 peculiar emphasis upon the last word ; " may be 
 endangered by a continuation of such madness. Let 
 me request you to endeavour to recover your compo- 
 sure, and immediately to join the Gentlemen in the 
 next room." 
 
 For she now perceived that Lord Altamont had

 considerately withdi-awn from the apartment, and had 
 also contrived to take the Painter away with him. 
 
 Henry rose in an agony of shame, despair, and 
 resentment ; and Adelaide who had by this time re- 
 covered from the effects of her astonishment, had no 
 difficulty in comprehending the j^robable nature of 
 his feelings. 
 
 Mustering her courage by a desperate effort, " Stay 
 one moment," she began, " I must not let you leave 
 me thus. I do not know how I can express what 1 
 wish to say to you, — yet I am unwilling to lose the 
 most favorable opportunity that may ever come in 
 my way, of requesting that heartless and unworthy 
 as I have perhaps hitherto appeared to you ; you will 
 in future look upon my former conduct in the most 
 charitable possible light. — Were you perfectly ac- 
 quainted with the truth, 3^ou would I think allow 
 that I have been a person more sinned against than 
 sinning." 
 
 " That is an assertion/' replied Henry, " which 
 you will very easily persuade me to believe. — Alas ! 
 liow ardently do I wish that Sir George and Lady

 Fauconberg would permit me in return to endeavour 
 to plead a few words in my own justification, to 
 you." 
 
 " This," said her Ladyshijj, " is neither a time or 
 place for long explanations, nor is Adelaide just now 
 sufficiently calm to be able to listen to them with 
 advantage. It is certainly very desirable that all 
 misconstructions de part et d'autre, (and many such 
 have occurred between us ; ) should be finally cleared 
 away ; and as the management of this delicate busi- 
 ness ought properly to be entrusted to Sir George, he 
 will I am sure, if you will give me your address, have 
 much pleasure in calling* upon you before you go 
 out to-morrow morning." 
 
 Colonel Algernon took a Card from his pocket, 
 observed " that he was staying with Lord Altamoiit, 
 and that he should certainly remain at home until any 
 hour when it might best suit Sir George's convenience 
 to visit him." 
 
 " And now," continued Lady Fauconberg, " since 
 it seems probable that we may meet again at no very 
 distant period, I hope you will not object a second

 time to facilitating our present separation. — In other 
 words that you will oblige me by enquiring" for my 
 Carriage." 
 
 Henry went immediately into the passage to obey 
 her Ladyship's command, and when he returned he 
 found her in deep conversation with the Artist, 
 repeating her apologies about taking away her 
 Daughter, and setthng the day and hour for a future 
 sitting. 
 
 He did not feel quite sure if he might dare to offer 
 his arm to Adelaide, but a gracious smile from her 
 Mother encouraged him to do so. She took it with- 
 out speaking, but as he thought, with evident plea- 
 sure ; and as he conducted her to the Carriage he 
 ventured to say to her in a low voice, 
 
 " When I entered this house an hour ago, 
 melancholy, forlorn, and hopeless ; how Httle did I 
 anticipate the happy alteration that would take place 
 in all my feelings before I again passed its threshold. 
 May I, — tell me at once, may I flatter myself that 
 any favorable change in my future destiny will be 
 likely to result from my interview with your Father 
 to-morrow ?"

 " I must not," replied Adelaide with a sigh, " give 
 you any decided opinion upon so uncertain a subject 
 as your future destiny ; yet this much I may say, 
 that I hope after your meeting with my Father is 
 over, we shall both feel happier than we have done 
 since we parted."

 Lord Altamont was extremely curious to learn 
 what had passed between Miss Fauconherg and his 
 Grandson. Henry gave him a faithful sketch of the 
 scene, but confessed there was so much mystery 
 attached to the cause of their former separation, that 
 he was himself still at a loss entirely to understand it. 
 He added, that he had great hopes he should be able, 
 when he had seen Sir George, to give a more intelli- 
 gible explanation of the subject; or what might be 
 far better, to communicate the agreable information,

 that all ground of his difference and dispute with the 
 Fauconberg Family being happily removed, — they 
 had mutually determined to forget that any Feud had 
 ever existed to divide them. 
 
 " For your sake my dear Henry," said Lord Alta- 
 mont, " I sincerely trust that this may prove the c£ise. 
 I own too that Miss Fauconberg's appearance has 
 prepossessed me not a httle in her favour, and I am 
 very willing to think that I have been guilty of injus- 
 tice in imputing blame to Her. Still I cannot divest 
 myself of the opinion that you were ill used ; and I 
 am anxious to put you upon your guard against the 
 artifices of those who have aheady acted towards you 
 with any thing but good faith. You have suffered 
 much from their treachery, — and before such a 
 warning is too late, let me now beseech you not to 
 endanger your future peace of mind by allowinir 
 yourself to be a second time imposed upon by delu- 
 sive hopes." 
 
 Henry thanked Lord Altamont for his kindness, 
 and promised to remember, and to attend to his 
 hmts; yet they did not in the sUghtest degree abate

 216 ADELAIDE. 
 
 the sanguine and feverish impatience with which he 
 looked forward to the Baronet's visit. During that 
 visit he felt that his happiness or misery must be 
 finally decided ; various agitating considerations pres- 
 sed upon his mind, and his spirits were at length 
 wrought up to a state of excitement which almost 
 bordered upon delirium. 
 
 Sir George did not prolong his suspense by any 
 unnecessary delay. He was announced at an earher 
 hour than the generality of Guests are expected, and 
 his naturally frank and cordial manner diminished 
 the unavoidable awkwardness which attended his first 
 entrance. Henry's anxious enquiries about Miss Fau- 
 conberg's health, led at once to the subject he had 
 come purposely to discuss, and he immediately took 
 advantage of the opening thus fortunately afforded 
 him. 
 
 He told Colonel Algernon, '' that he had been for 
 a great while very desirous to have an opportunity of 
 explaining to him a mystery, and requesting his for- 
 giveness for an unhappy mistake into which he had 
 been betrayed respecting those sad events he had

 alluded to before they parted at Fauconberg Manor." 
 — He said " that it was not until very long after he 
 had left England, that he accidentally discovered the 
 injustice of which he had unintentionally been guilty ; 
 not indeed until after its fatal consequences had drawn 
 down a most distressing punishment upon his own 
 Family. — That his first impulse upon learning his 
 error, had been a wish to acknowledge it, and endea- 
 vour as far as might be possible to repair it. But 
 that upon reflection he found this would be difficult, 
 almost impracticable; — since the Story he had to 
 relate involved so many delicate circumstances that 
 he could not venture to commit it to paper, or to 
 bring it under consideration in any other way than 
 during a personal interview with himself." 
 
 Sir George then minutely related the manner in 
 which the anonymous communication had been con- 
 veyed to him; and taking the Letter as he did so 
 from his pocket, begged Colonel Algernon would do 
 him the favour to look it over attentively. 
 
 " Had I insisted upon your reading it when I ori- 
 ginally received it," added he, " all the mischief it

 218 ADELAIDE. 
 
 afterwards occasioned would have been averted. I 
 have frequently reproached myself for not having 
 I3ursued that straight forward course." 
 
 " I well remember," replied Henry, " that you 
 offered me a sight of a Letter, and proposed to me to 
 read my accusation; but I was at that moment too 
 indignant to condescend even to look at it. — I will 
 gladly set about studying it now." 
 
 He perused the Manuscript accordingly with the 
 greatest care, and not without evident emotion; in- 
 deed he scarcely attempted to disguise those feelings 
 of grief and anger which it alternately awakened. 
 
 " I have acted like a Madman !" exclaimed he at 
 length. " Had not my foolish pride deprived me of 
 the means of defending myself, — ^by teaching me to 
 disdain examining the charge that was brought against 
 me ; every thing would at once have been explained, 
 and my character would have been satisfactorily 
 cleared from the foul stain which has been so basely 
 and scandalously cast upon it." 
 
 Then in a musing tone he continued, — 
 
 " This Letter must have been written by some per-

 son perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of 
 poor Basilia's History. It is very artfully and cleverly 
 composed. — ^Who can possibly have been the Author 
 of it ?" 
 
 " I will answer that question in one word," said Sir 
 George, interrupting the sort of Soliloquy into which 
 Henry had fallen. " You cannot have forgotten 
 Thomas Woodgate." 
 
 " Woodgate," cried Colonel Algernon in an accent 
 of surprise. " Nobody who had been in any way 
 concerned with him, could ever forget him. A trea- 
 cherous, designing Villain he always was. I have 
 not met with any Man, either before or since I knew 
 him, so desperately wicked and revengeful. — It must 
 certainly have been him who contrived this falsehood, 
 for no other person is in possession of our fatal secret. 
 I begin to understand the mystery now, and if I had 
 not been unpardonably stupid, I must have discovered 
 it sooner, Yet," observed he, again examining the 
 Letter, '' Woodgate must have had an Accomplice ; 
 he might, and undoubtedly did, furnish the informa- 
 tion upon which this Romance is founded ; but the

 style and language are superior to any thing he could 
 have composed without assistance." 
 
 '' Your suspicion is perfectly just," replied Sir 
 George. " I am sorry to say that Woodgate was 
 only employed as the tool of a person whose situation 
 in the world ought to have raised him far above the 
 dishonour of falsely and clandestinely destroying the 
 reputation of a Rival, and the degradation of conde- 
 scending to league himself in iniquity with such a 
 worthless associate in order to accomplish his unprin- 
 cipled purpose." 
 
 Henry was horror-struck by the new light which 
 now suddenly burst upon his mind. Sir George 
 touched slightly upon the anguish his Daughter had 
 suffered when the Story which had occasioned his 
 departure was first cautiously revealed to her. 
 
 " And did Miss Fauconberg too believe me guilty ? 
 Did she think me capable of having endeavoured to 
 gain her affections when I knew that my hand had 
 been secretly stained by the commission of so dreadful 
 a Crime ?" asked Henry in a voice of bitter agony. 
 
 " Adelaide was willing," replied the Baronet, " to

 pity you. To admit every possible excuse as a pal- 
 liation of your misfortune ; but she could discover no 
 ])lea to doubt your guilt when her Father stated it to 
 her as a positive fact which had even been confirmed 
 to him by your own admission. For I must now 
 candidly tell you, that in our last ambiguous conver- 
 sation, I imagined you had confessed the truth of the 
 accusation which had been brought against you." 
 
 Colonel Algernon remained some moments lost in 
 thought. 
 
 " I have been trying," said he at length, "^^ to re- 
 collect every word that passed between us on that 
 unhappy night; and with the impression you then 
 had upon your mind, I must allow that I answered 
 your questions in such a manner as naturally to con- 
 firm your worst suspicions. Any Person in your cir- 
 cumstances would have put the same construction 
 upon my replies that You did ; and considering the 
 opinion you must have entertained of me, I can only 
 wonder at the temper and forbearance with which 
 you treated me. — You appear to be now fally aware 
 that I have been basely calumniated, but still it is

 222 ADELAIDE. 
 
 imperiously necessary that I should give you a minute 
 and accurate Version of my real share in this melan- 
 choly and unfortunate transaction." 
 
 " I will listen with pleasure bye and by," replied 
 Sir George, ^' to any recital you may judge it expe- 
 dient to enter into, but I trust you will first permit 
 me to finish my own explanation." 
 
 He then briefly mentioned the little Tour he had 
 made with his Family Abroad, — the encreased inti- 
 macy with their Neighbours at Greyfield, — and the 
 consequent renewal of Mr. Shirley's attentions to his 
 Daughter. He confessed that Lady Fauconbevg and 
 himself had wished Adelaide to receive these more 
 favorably than she was inclined to do ; — that she had 
 long remained inexorable upon the subject, — and 
 that at last it was merely from a secret sense of duty 
 towards her Parents, that she had consented to form 
 an Union which she saw they ardently desired. — That 
 it was not until the morning this miserable Marriage 
 was to have been celebrated, — that, instigated by a 
 new impulse of revenge, Mr. Shirley's wretched Ac- 
 complice disclosed the whole train of his treachery

 ADELAIDE. 2*23 
 
 to its destined Victim. — He detailed at considerable 
 length every part of the communication which Wood- 
 gate had made upon that memorable occasion, and 
 added that the shock Adelaide had naturally received 
 from it, had brought on a violent illness, from the 
 effects of which she had as yet by no means reco- 
 vered. 
 
 Henry's indignation at Mr. Shirley's conduct knew 
 no bounds. 
 
 " Did you allow his wicked treachery," exclaimed 
 he, " to escape unpunished ? Did you not expose 
 his heartless villany to all the world ?" 
 
 " I felt as much disposed as You can be, to do so," 
 answered Sir George, " And if I spared him it was 
 out of no consideration of pity towards himself. — In a 
 private interview I gave him to understand that his 
 Confederate had betrayed him ; and I can never for- 
 get the agony and humiliation he evidently suffered at 
 that moment. — I saw him afterwards no more. — Had 
 I published his dishonour I should perhaps have bro- 
 ken his poor Father's heart, and it was for my Friend 
 Sir Wilham's sake that I determined to conceal his

 224 ADELAIDE. 
 
 disgrace. — Another reflection might also have had 
 much force in prompting me to pursue the same Hne 
 of conduct. It would have been impossible for me to 
 make out my own Story against Mr. Shirley, without 
 disclosing circumstances connected with your Family, 
 which I well knew you ardently wished should remain 
 buried in oblivion. — It is but justice to Adelaide, to 
 add that she had the generosity anxiously to request 
 me to screen the character of the Person who had so 
 deeply injured her, — though she was conscious that by 
 so doing, much blame would undeservedly be imputed 
 to herself — The awful fate of this wretched young 
 Man, has since led me sincerely to rejoice at having 
 saved Sir William the bitter aggravation of being 
 :iware in his affliction, of the worthless and degraded 
 character of the Son whose loss he affectionately de- 
 plores." 
 
 Colonel Algernon was sensibly afl*ectecl by the diffe- 
 rent details he had just heard, and much impressed 
 with admiration of the magnanimity both Adelaide 
 and her Father had shown in their conduct towards 
 Mr. Shirley. He was beginning to express this, when 
 Sir George continued,

 ADELAIDE. 225 
 
 " The ways of Providence are wonderful and 
 mysterious, and it has always struck me that there 
 appeared a something like retribution in the circum- 
 stances of William Shirley's death. — Considering the 
 various links by which their fates had been connected, 
 it was very remarkable that he should have fallen by 
 the hand of Colonel Algernon." 
 
 o 
 
 " It was certainly curious," replied Henry. " Poor 
 Horace! His misdeeds have, unknown to himself, 
 been the cause of all the misery I have suffered ; and 
 He also it is who has unconsciously in so signal a 
 manner avenged my wrongs. — But," continued he 
 very anxiously, " You hinted just now that Miss 
 Fauconberg's health had been seriously affected by 
 Mr. Shirley's treachery, — and my own observation 
 yesterday had already awakened my alarm upon that 
 subject. — I hope you have no ground to be disquieted 
 by more than temporarj^ uneasiness about her." 
 
 " I hope not," answered Sir George, gravely. " I 
 cannot see any reason to apprehend the impossibihty 
 of her regaining in time her former bloom and 
 strength ; yet I will not conceal from you that Lady

 Fauconberg and I — ^have been long, and still continue 
 very uncomfortable about her. Perhaps our extreme 
 anxiety to preserve so inestimable a treasure makes 
 us feel over anxious and apprehensive. — ^You think 
 Adelaide looking- ill and altered now^ but had you 
 seen her last year when she was first recovering from 
 her fever, you would have had no idea that she could 
 ever have been restored even to her present appear- 
 ance. When I recollect how fearfully delicate she 
 was then^ I am encouraged to look forward with some 
 degree of sanguine confidence to the happy improve- 
 ment that may take place in a few more months." 
 
 Colonel Algernon turned away his head to hide 
 the emotion which he had not power to repress. Sir 
 George was too much overcome to attemj)t to speak; 
 and it was not till after a very long pause that the 
 former found courage to say, 
 
 '' There is one question I very much wish to ask 
 you Sir George, yet I scarcely know if I may venture 
 to do so." 
 
 " Why need you be afraid of me ?" replied the 
 Baronet kindly, " there is no information you can

 require, which if I am able, I will not cheerfully give 
 you. I shall fancy you still mistrust me, if you do 
 not tell me at once what it is that you wish to learn." 
 
 Henry still hesitated, — at length he said, — 
 
 " I can endure the tortures of suspense no longer, 
 I must hear my fate in one word! — May I dare to 
 encourage a hope, that whatever she may once have 
 thought of me, I am not now quite indifferent to Miss 
 Fauconberg ?" 
 
 He fixed his eyes upon his Companion's counte- 
 nance as he uttered these words, and his very life 
 seemed to depend upon the reply he expected to re- 
 ceive from him. 
 
 Sir George smiled. " You must address that ques- 
 tion," observed he, " to Miss Fauconberg herself, 
 She will be much more capable of answering it satis- 
 factorily than I can be ; and as you seem rather im- 
 patient to ascertain her sentiments, perhaps you will 
 like to join us this afternoon in Kensington Gardens. 
 We shall go there about four o'clock." Then per- 
 ceiving that Henry was almost bewildered with his 
 happiness, he held out his hand and continued in a 
 more serious tone, —

 " My dear Colonel Algernon we now again un- 
 derstand each other, had we always done so we never 
 should have ceased to be Friends. Let us mutually 
 endeavour to forget the past, and to hope that we 
 may still at some future period be connected by nearer 
 and dearer ties than even those of Friendship.'''' 
 
 Henry tried in vain to express the feelings with 
 which his heart was overflowing. 
 
 " I must leave you," said Sir George, "and I shall 
 go away with less regret because I am sure it will at 
 this moment do you no harm to find yourself for a 
 little while alone." 
 
 " Will you not allow me to introduce you to my 
 Grandfather?" asked Colonel Algernon, attempting 
 to detain him. 
 
 " T shall be proud," rephed the Baronet, " to be- 
 come personally acquainted with Lord Altamont at 
 some other opportunity ; but I think it will be expe- 
 dient to defer my introduction to him until you have 
 ascertained from himself that it will be agreable to 
 him that it should take place." 
 
 " That he will be delighted to be made known to 
 you I will readily engage to answer for," exclaimed

 ADELAIDE. 2^9 
 
 Henry. " But perhaps, as you say, it may be bet- 
 ter to prepare him to see you, by relating to him 
 how happily our interview has terminated. — It will 
 require some consideration to devise in what manner 
 this communication can be most judiciously made, for 
 of course I must contrive to avoid the slightest allu- 
 sion to any circumstance connected with Horace." 
 
 Henry did accordingly give Lord Altamont such 
 an account of what had passed, as perfectly satisfied 
 his Grandfather''s curiosity, without betraying the 
 Secret he had kept so faithfully, and suflfered so much 
 to conceal. And he was deeply gratified by the 
 kind and affectionate warmth with which the old 
 Peer participated in his happiness. 
 
 It is almost needless to say that Colonel Algernon 
 did not forget to keep his engagement very punctu- 
 ally that afternoon in Kensington Gardens, indeed he 
 had been pacing up and down before the Gate for a 
 long time before the expected Carriage with Servants 
 in the well-known Fauconberg Livery appeared in 
 sight. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg condescended to smile upon him 
 very graciously when he came forward to hand her

 out of it ; but as Sir George immediately presented 
 her his arm, he could not in civility do less than offer 
 his own to her Daughter, who accepted it with a 
 blush of conscious pleasure. 
 
 It so happened that the whole Party instead of 
 following the Crowd to the fashionable part of the 
 Gardens, prefen*ed turning their steps into one of the 
 more retired Walks; and Adelaide and Colonel Al- 
 gernon soon became so deeply interested in their own 
 conversation, that had they chanced to be surrounded 
 by all the Persons of their acquaintance, they would 
 perhaps scarcely have been aware of their presence. 
 They had mutually many things to learn, and much 
 to explain ; but Henry would only allow his Compa- 
 nion to touch slightly upon those circumstances, the 
 recollection of which he thought likely to agitate her. 
 In this manner the time flew rapidly away, and Lady 
 Fauconberg was obliged to remind Adelaide ' that 
 they must positively return home, since she had 
 already taken a much longer walk than she had lately 
 been accustomed to.' 
 
 " We shall see you to-morrow," said Sir George 
 to Henry, when they parted. " I would ask you to

 look in upon us this evening", but my Young" Lady 
 now keeps veiy early hours ; and as she has had a 
 good deal to excite her in the course of the morning, 
 we shall wish her to remain as quiet as possible during 
 the rest of the day." 
 
 Colonel Algernon felt the necessity of this caution. 
 The more he saw of Adelaide, the more painfiilly did 
 he become aware of the extreme delicacy of her 
 appearance ; it threw a fearful chill over all his bright 
 prospects of happiness, and he could not help per- 
 ceiving from some of her expressions, that she seemed 
 to be herself fully sensible of the precarious state of 
 her health. 
 
 The whole of her present conduct, and every thing 
 she had just told him, had raised his admiration of 
 her character if possible, even higher than it had 
 been before; and as he bade her farewell — ^he felt 
 that she had become dearer to him than ever. 
 
 He would have been not a little delighted could he 
 have read what was at that moment passing in her 
 mind, and have discovered that his own behaviour 
 under circumstances both of trial and prosperity, had 
 left an equally favorable impression there.

 " What a fatiguing place this is !" said our worthy 
 Friend Mrs. Sutton to her Sister, after they had heen 
 toihng up and down Kensington Gardens for more 
 than an hour beneath a scorching Sun, for the agre- 
 able purpose of meeting their Friends, and gazing at 
 the smart people and at the fashions. " I am really 
 tired to death, and almost melted with the heat !" 
 
 " It is certainly rather overcoming," replied Miss 
 Drake, " and yet when one is only in London for a 
 few days, it is much better to drive to a morning 
 Assembly of this sort where one is sure to find all the 
 world, than to be at the trouble of calling upon every

 body separately. — Besides in that way there is little 
 or no chance of seeing any one." 
 
 When these remarks were made, the two Ladies 
 had just seated themselves in their somewhat antiqua- 
 ted Post Chaise, which was driven by a Job Coachman 
 hired for the day, and dressed in a greasy thread- 
 bare Great Coat. As they proceeded at a steady 
 pace, Mrs. Sutton suddenly exclaimed, 
 
 *"' That is Lady Fauconberg's Carriage. How 
 very provoking that we should have missed the Peo- 
 ple in all London we were most anxious to meet !" 
 
 There was no Check-String, so she let down the 
 window and called loudly to the Coachman to stop ; 
 but he either did not or would not hear the appeal, 
 till after the smart Equipage which had attracted 
 Mrs. Sutton's attention, had driven rapidly off in an 
 opposite direction. 
 
 ''' It was the Fauconberg Party sure enough," 
 observed Miss Drake, who fully shared her Sister's 
 vexation in having been unable to arrest them ; " and 
 if T am not very much mistaken, the Young Man 
 who handed Adelaide into the Carriage with such

 assiduous devotion, was no other Person than our old 
 Friend Colonel Henry Algernon." 
 
 " Impossible," said Mrs. Sutton. " After the quar- 
 rel we all but witnessed between Adelaide and her 
 former Lover, nothing can ever bring them together 
 again." 
 
 She stretched her head out of the window as she 
 spoke, with a hope of catching a glympse of the 
 Figure of the Gentleman who had just parted from 
 her Friends, — but he was gone. 
 
 " My eyes are not very apt to deceive me," re- 
 marked Miss Drake rather drily, " And I believe you 
 will find that they have not done so in this instance." 
 
 '' Well," replied Mrs. Sutton, " I have long ceased 
 to wonder at any thing, yet undoubtedly this is very 
 wonderful." 
 
 " It appears evident to me," continued her Sister, 
 thoughtfully, " that some unusual business is in agita- 
 tion just at present in the Fauconberg Family. We 
 called in Berkeley-Square late in the day yesterday 
 and were told that nobody was at home ; we repeated 
 our visit at an early hour this morning, and received

 the same answer. Upon neither of these occasions do 
 I imagine that we heard the truth; and I am con- 
 vinced it must have been some very important reason 
 that could tempt Lady Fauconberg twice to deny 
 herself to us." 
 
 When Mrs. Sutton summoned her Maid to undress 
 her at night, she perceived by her manner that she 
 had a piece of intelhgence to communicate. After 
 fidgetting about for several minutes, the trusty Abi- 
 gail asked her Mistress if she had seen Lady and 
 Miss Fauconberg since she had been in London ? 
 
 '' No, I have not," was the ready answer. " Have 
 you heard any thing particular about them ?" 
 
 " Why after you were gone out to dinner, I just 
 stepped for half an hour into Berkeley-Square, to ask 
 her Ladyship's Maid, (who you know Ma'am is an 
 old Acquaintance of mine,) how she did ; and I found 
 all the Servants in the House in a great fuss and a 
 rejoicing about their young Mistress's Wedding that 
 is to be. — The Officer Gentleman who was to have 
 married her when we were in the North long ago, is 
 now come back from Abroad. He was walking with

 Sir George and the Ladies this morning in Kensing- 
 ton Gardens. They say Miss Fauconberg always 
 liked him much better than poor Mr. Shirley, and 
 that he is now to be her Husband after all." 
 
 This confirmation of Miss Drake's suspicions left 
 no doubt of their accuracy in the minds of either of 
 the Sisters. 
 
 They longed to hear minutely all the details of the 
 Story ; and they regrette;! that so many hours of the 
 night must still elapse before they could possibly at- 
 tempt to offer their personal congratulations to the 
 Bride Elect, or undertake the pleasing but laborious 
 task of travelling from one House to another to con- 
 vey the first news of her intended Marriage to all 
 their Friends. 
 
 Adelaide's mind was much relieved by the con- 
 sciousness that Colonel Algernon had been informed 
 of the deceit that had been imposed upon her Family, 
 and that he had forgiven the mistake it had occa- 
 sioned. She rejoiced too in knowing that that part of 
 her Father's treatment of him which he must hitherto 
 have considered harsh and ungracious, could now ap-

 pear in that light no longer. In short a heavy weight 
 was removed from her Spirits ; and instead of her 
 health having been affected or her nerves injuriously 
 shaken by the agitating occurrences of the last two 
 days; the former seemed any thing but worse, while 
 the latter were visibly tranquillized. 
 
 Mrs. Sutton and Miss Drake were destined to find 
 their next attempt to see our Heroine as ineffectual 
 as the preceding ones. Before the hour when they 
 considered they might with propriety present them- 
 selves at Lady Fauconberg's door, Colonal Algernon, 
 ; accompanied by Lord Altamont had been announced, 
 i and the Servant had consequently received an order 
 that nobody elsa was to be admitted. 
 
 The good Ladies were rather nettled by this ex- 
 clusion. They did not give up their idea of dissemi- 
 nating the intelligence of the approaching mamage ; 
 but they were mortified at being obliged to mention 
 it only as a Report, (founded indeed upon unquestion- 
 able information ;) instead of being able, as they had 
 hoped, to declare it as an Event which they were au- 
 tliorized by the Family to announce.

 Nothing could be kinder or more flattering than 
 Lord AUamont's manner to Adelaide when she was 
 first introduced to him. He and Sir George were 
 mutually pleased with each other; and Lady Fau- 
 conberg, who was in high good humour, entertained 
 little doubt that She had also made a favorable im- 
 pression uj)on his Lordship. 
 
 Towards the conclusion of his visit, he found an 
 opportunity of telling the Baronet, " that as Henry 
 had informed him Miss Fauconberg had lately been 
 an Invalid, he thought change of air might prove be- 
 neficial to her ; he therefore hoped he should be able 
 to persuade Lady Fauconberg and himself to do him 
 the favour of spending a few weeks with him at Alta- 
 mont Castle." He said, " that it was a long while 
 since he had been in the habit of receiving many 
 Guests there, but as his Daughter-in-Law Mrs. Al- 
 gernon, was kind enough to keep every thing in very 
 good order; he believed he could contrive to make 
 them comfortable during their sejour under his roof: 
 and that if they would only dare the experiment, it 
 would give him the greatest satisfaction to see them."

 He added, " that there were several Places in his 
 Neighbourhood, well worth looking at, and that the 
 surrounding Country was very picturesque : — but 
 that he must depute the agreable task of showing 
 them the distant Lions to his Grandson, since he had 
 himself become too infirm to be equal to that sort of 
 exertion." 
 
 Sir George assured Lord Altamout "• that he was 
 extremely gratified by the kindness of this invitation, 
 and that nothing would afford him greater pleasure 
 than having the honour of accepting it ; — but that he 
 much feared so large an addition to his Lordship's 
 Family Party would prove troublesome." 
 
 '' By no means," replied the Peer. " Henry will 
 tell you that I never make French CompHments, and 
 that if I had not really wished to see you, I should not 
 
 have pretended to ask you to come and visit me. 
 
 Seriously speaking, I feel a great desire that we 
 should be more intimately acquainted than we are at 
 present ; and at my age you will allow that I have no 
 time to lose." 
 
 Colonel Algernon's eyes sparkled with delight at 
 the idea of seeing Adelaide at Altamont Castle.

 '' What an admirable plan !" exclaimed he. " In- 
 deed Sir George you must agree to my Grandfather's 
 proposal." 
 
 Then tm*ning to Miss Fauconberg he added, "Will 
 not You kindly aid me to plead in its favour ?" 
 
 " I believe," replied she, " that it will be unneces- 
 sary to do so. Yet I must confess that as far as / am 
 concerned, there could be no invitation I should half 
 so much like to accept." 
 
 " I have little doubt," observed Lady Fauconberg, 
 who had yet taken no part in the discussion, "That 
 the remedy Lord Altamont has been so kind as to 
 recommend, would have a happier effect upon my 
 Daughter's health, than any thing that has been pre- 
 scribed for her by her Physicians." 
 
 " And at any rate," concluded Adelaide, blushing 
 deeply as she spoke — '' It would be far more agre- 
 able." 
 
 It was accordingly determined that when the Fau- 
 conberg Family left London, they should, (instead 
 of returning to the North,) proceed directly to Alta- 
 mont Castle ; and after remaining there a short time, 
 make a little Tour along the Southern Coast.

 Lord Altamont staid in Town about a fortnight 
 longer, and during that period he was a very frequent 
 Visitor in Berkeley Square, where it may easily be 
 imagined that his Grandson contris^ed to spend the 
 greater part of all his mornings and evenings. 
 
 The moment Henry's prospects began to assume a 
 settled form, he resolved to go upon Half Pay, and he 
 immediately set on fool the necessary arrangements 
 to carry that intention speedily into effect. 
 
 Little remained to be concluded between him and 
 Sir George. They decided that if Adelaide's health 
 continued to improve, the Union which adverse causes 
 had so cruelly conspired to obstruct, should take place 
 late in the Autumn. And as many recollections might 
 naturally render it unpleasant to the Bride to have 
 the Ceremony performed at Fauconberg, it was pro- 
 posed that the MaiTiage should be celebrated in 
 London. 
 
 It was there too, that in confonnity with their ori- 
 ginal plan, Colonel and Mrs. Henry Algernon were 
 to fix their nominal Abode ; and for more than a 
 month Lady Fauconberg's active spirit found con-

 stant occupation in the delightful tasks of House 
 hunting and various other matrimonial preparations. 
 
 Colonel Algernon felt much anxiety to ascertain 
 what was become of Woodgate. He did not appre- 
 hend that he could again have it in his power perso- 
 nally to injure himself; but it struck him as far from 
 impossible that if he was driven to extreme distress, 
 he might be tempted to make an appeal to Lord 
 Altamont, and thus discover to him the secret which 
 had hitherto been so carefully kept from him. 
 
 All his endeavours to trace out the wretched Man 
 proved ineffectual, and at length he entirely gave up 
 the attempt. 
 
 About a week before Henry left Town, as he 
 was returning home in the dusk of the evening, he 
 was accosted by a miserable looking Beggar, who 
 appeared to be in the last stage of some mortal illness. 
 He was crawling along at a slow pace, and he seemed 
 to have scarcely strength enough left to drag one foot 
 after the other. 
 
 " For God sake. Sir," said he in a feeble, hollow 
 tone, " take pity upon a poor Object who has not

 many days to live. — Whatever I may formerly have 
 been, I am no Impostor now; and it will be a real 
 charity to bestow upon me the smallest trifle." 
 
 Colonel Algernon was startled by the sound of the 
 Man's voice ; and upon examining his features more 
 attentively, he had little difficulty 5 — altered as they 
 were, in recognising them. 
 
 " I think you do not know me, Woodgate," he 
 repHed. 
 
 The unhappy Wretch shrunk back in an agony of 
 horror and dismay, and would have fallen upon the 
 pavement if Henry had not supported him. 
 
 " I know you now Sir," he exclaimed, " And my 
 having applied to You to reheve me, is a proper 
 judgement upon me for my wickedness. Oh Colonel 
 Henry, I do not deseiTe to receive any mercy at your 
 hands, — I have injured you deeply. I dare not ask 
 for your forgiveness, — yet spare me, spare me ; I 
 have been severely punished here already, and I am 
 dying ! ' 
 
 Henry was much affected. 
 
 " We will not talk of injuries now," he said. '' You

 seem to require immediate medical aid, and I will 
 lose no time in procuring it for you." 
 
 " It is too late," replied Woodgate, " Nothing can 
 now restore me, and I do not even wish my miserable 
 life prolonged ; much as I have reason to dread the 
 approach of death. — But your kindness Sir, is a more 
 bitter reproach to me than all I have suffered. It 
 plants daggers in my hard heart. Had you reviled 
 me as I expected you would have done, I could have 
 borne that much better." 
 
 As the wretched Sufferer seemed unwilling, per- 
 haps ashamed to mention where he lived, — if indeed 
 he had any settled Abode ; Colonel Algernon asked 
 him if he should object to being conveyed to an 
 Hospital ?" 
 
 '' I should fonnerly," answered he, " have consi- 
 dered it a degradation which nothing could have 
 induced me to submit to ; but my pride has been so 
 humbled, that I should be very thankful to go to such 
 a place now if I could only obtain admittance." 
 
 Henry proceeded directly to make an application 
 to the proper Authorities, and his measures were

 taken with so much activity that he possessed himself 
 of an Order which enabled him to have Woodgate 
 removed that very night to the Hospital he had sug- 
 gested. He spoke to him very kindly before he left 
 him, and promised to come and see how he was the 
 next day. 
 
 He was as good as his word; and when he en- 
 quired of the Surgeon about the state of his Patient ? 
 the Medical Man shook his head, and observed ' that 
 the case was hopeless ; — that he appeared to be in the 
 last stage of a decline, and that so much delirium 
 had come on during the night — that his little remain- 
 ing strength seemed nearly exhausted, and a few 
 hours would probably terminate his existence.' 
 
 " I conclude," added he, " that I am speaking to 
 Colonel Algernon. The Nurse tells me that he has 
 expressed the greatest anxiety and impatience to see 
 You, and that he was much afraid he should die be- 
 fore you arrived. She suspects that he has something 
 upon his mind, some crime which he wishes to con- 
 fess to You. He has raved much about a Murdered 
 Lady, he seems to be possessed with an idea that he

 is haunted by her Spirit, and this fancy keeps him in 
 a state of constant terror. But his wanderings are 
 altogether so wild and incoherent that it is impossi- 
 ble to comprehend what they may refer to." 
 
 Henry requested to be conducted immediately to 
 the Ward where Woodgate had been placed. The 
 miserable Sufferer received him with a look of nervous 
 eagerness, — thanked him for his goodness in coming 
 to visit him, — and begged to be allowed to have some 
 conversation with him in private. This petition was 
 of course readily complied with, and Woodgate 
 making an exertion to raise himself in his bed, began 
 a detail of all his crimes and his feelings from the 
 period of his first interference in the affairs of the un- 
 fortunate Donna Basilia de Lerma. 
 
 Henry endeavoured to stop him, he saw the fearful 
 hold that subject had taken upon his mind, he wished 
 to spare him a recital which could only awaken more 
 bitter agonies of remorse, — and he thought that the 
 effort of talking for any length of time, would alone 
 be extremely bad for him. He therefore told him 
 that he was perfectly acquainted with every circum-

 ADELAIDE. 247 
 
 stance of his conduct in Spain, and that he had also 
 heard from Sir George Fauconberg of his compact 
 with Mr. Sliirley, and of all the consequences that 
 had resulted from it. 
 
 " Then you have seen Sir George ?" exclaimed 
 Woodgate. 
 
 " I have, and I think it will be a comfort to you 
 to know that the past is forgiven and forgotten, and 
 that we are now better Friends than ever we were." 
 
 '' That is at least one Sin taken off my conscience," 
 said Woodg'ate, joyfully. '' And I am deeply obliged 
 to you Sir for having told me that all is again just 
 as it should be between You and Miss Fauconberg. — 
 Poor Young Lady! I can never forget how beauti- 
 ful yet how death-like she looked that morning when 
 she was to have been married to Mr. Shirley ; or 
 how petrified with hori'or I was, after I had told her 
 You were innocent of the murder and that you were 
 still alive, when I saw her fall senseless upon the floor, 
 and believed that my news had really killed her." 
 
 This was a part of the Story Henry had not before 
 heard, it was consequently natural enough that lie

 did not attempt to check Woodgate's desire to recount 
 minutely the particulars of his memorable interview 
 with Adelaide. The poor Wretch had such a feverish 
 inclination to talk, that although it fatigued him to do 
 so, he had no power to stop himself. 
 
 The remaining part of his own Adventures may 
 be told in a few words. The money Miss Fauconberg 
 had given him supported him for a short time. He 
 found it necessary to conceal himself from the effects 
 of Mr. Shirley's resentment, and having accidentally 
 stumbled upon one of his former Friends and Compa- 
 nions, he became leagued with a Gang of desperate 
 Characters who subsisted by Gaming and Villany of 
 every description. The detection of one of the Party 
 in an offence in which all the others were implicated, 
 — at length obliged them to dissolve their Union and 
 separate in different directions; — and the want and 
 misery which followed this dispersion, had reduced 
 Woodgate to his present situation. — He appeared 
 truly penitent for his crimes, but was so impressed 
 with their magnitude that he had entirely given him- 
 self up to despair, and did not dare to think of seeking 
 Religious comfort or support.

 Colonel Algernon persuaded him to see a Clergy- 
 man, and found afterwards that he had expressed 
 great satisfaction at having done so ; — But when he 
 went to the Hospital the following day to learn how 
 the unhappy Man had passed the night, — he was in- 
 formed that he had expired a few hours after he had 
 left him. 
 
 Henry was a good deal shocked by his deplorable 
 fate, — yet upon Horace's account he could not help 
 feeUng that his death was a sort of relief. His reco- 
 very would not under any circumstances have been 
 desirable, since if he could have been restored to 
 health, it was but too likely that he would have re- 
 lapsed into his former evil courses ; — the only thing to 
 be regretted was that he had not been spared a little 
 longer to prepare himself for another world. 
 
 Henry had not much time to indulge these melan- 
 choly reflections, as he had duties of a more agreable 
 nature to attend to. He had been summoned by his 
 Grandfather to Altamont Castle, where he wished 
 him to arrive a few days before his other Guests; and 
 it will easily be believed that he had no inclination to 
 put off obeying that summons.

 250 ADELAIDE. 
 
 Mrs. Algernon looked forward with any thing but 
 satisfaction to the approach of the Fauconberg Family. 
 She could not help feeling a sort of jealousy at the 
 idea of Henry's Marriage. She contrasted it in her 
 mind with that of her own Son. — She knew that all 
 the world would say that her Nephew had made a 
 better and a wiser choice than his Cousin. Nobody 
 liked Julia, — she was a pennyless Girl who had 
 brought disgrace and misfortune as her Dower. — 
 Adelaide she was aware, was much beloved by all her 
 Acquaintance, she had the character of being a very 
 charming Person, and she was a great Heiress. 
 
 Mrs. Algeraon was prepared to hate the future 
 Bride, and to find fault with every thing she might 
 say or do; — but when she saw her, she was obliged 
 to confess to herself that it would be almost impossible 
 to act up to this uncharitable resolution. 
 
 Of Lady Fauconberg too, she soon began to form 
 a very favorable opinion, — and so rapid was the tran- 
 sition in her sentiments respecting her that before 
 her Ladyship had been eight and forty hours an In- 
 mate of Altamont Castle, she declared ' she thought

 her the most sensible as well as the most a^reable 
 Woman she had ever met with.' 
 
 The truth was, Lady Fauconberg had spared no 
 pains to conciliate Mrs. Algernon, and her fascinating 
 powers had not been exerted in vain. She had per- 
 ceived at once tlie nature of her feelings towards her 
 Daughter, and had also had discernment enough to 
 discover the weak points of her character. — She re- 
 turned her somewhat frigid reception with the most 
 studied civility, affected to treat her with the greatest 
 deference and attention, and as soon as she found her- 
 self alone with her, enquired with much apparent 
 interest if she had heard lately from her Daughter- 
 in-Law ? 
 
 " You are not perhaps aware," said she, " that I 
 have known Julia from her birth, and have been ac- 
 customed to consider her almost as a Child of my 
 own. Poor Thing she was giddy enough to be sure, 
 and sometimes a little wayward ; her high spirits 
 ran away with her, — but after all, at her age theft 
 was very excusable, and I have no doubt she is 
 grown much steadier now. She was always so great

 a favorite of Mine, that I thoug-ht other people, (who 
 did not really understand her as well as I did,) were 
 much too severe upon her. Her very superiority 
 was the means of making her many Enemies ; had 
 she been less clever, less brilliant in society, — she 
 would have been more generally liked. Those who 
 have not met her, can have no idea how entertaining 
 she is. I am sure whenever you become acquainted 
 with her you will agree with me in thinking her 
 quite delightful." 
 
 Mrs. Alo^ernon was charmed to hear her Daughter- 
 in-Law praised, and to be able to talk of her from 
 morning till night with a Person who seemed so fond 
 of her, and who was able to tell her every thing about 
 her. 
 
 In the course of these conversations, Lady Faucon- 
 berg adroitly contrived to insinuate that the circum- 
 stance of Henry Algernon's marrying an Heiress, 
 would be extremely advantageous to his relations, 
 since He would now be independently provided for, 
 and would require no future pecuniary assistance 
 from them.

 This hint produced the desired effect upon Mrs. 
 Algernon. It placed her Nephew's approaching 
 Union with Adelaide in a very different point of 
 view fi'om that in which she had originally consi- 
 dered it. She began to suspect that instead of being 
 prejudicial to her Son, no Event could upon his ac- 
 count be more desirable; — and she immediately 
 discovered that Miss Faiiconberg possessed every 
 amiable quality under the Sun, and that Henry had 
 been both fortunate and judicious in selecting so ad- 
 mirable a Wife. She found much amusement in 
 interesting herself in all the little details and ar- 
 rangements which her new Friend was liberal in 
 communicating to her, and she became as unwilling 
 to think of the departure of the agreable Guests, as 
 she had formerly been to prepare for their arrival. 
 
 Lord Altamont had derived sincere pleasure from 
 their society. There was a charm in Adelaide's en- 
 gaging manner which had delighted him from the 
 first moment he saw her ; and when he had after- 
 wards an opportunity of studying her amiable and 
 interesting character, his admiration of " his future

 Grand- Daughter," (as lie always called her,) was 
 warm enough even to satisfy Henry. 
 
 Her health and strength improved rapidly. — Lord 
 Altamont declared that it was the West of England 
 Air which had agreed with her, and had done her so 
 much good ; he would not hear of her leaving it till 
 she had grown quite stout, — and a visit which had 
 been originally projected to last ten days, was thus 
 prolonged to six weeks. When the day of her de- 
 parture at length arrived, the kind old Peer would not 
 allow her to wish him good bye until Henry had pro- 
 mised to bring her to see him again before Christmas.

 It was in the very beginning of October that the 
 Morning Post announced to the world the Marriage 
 of Colonel Henry Algernon and Miss Fauconberg ; 
 and declared that " after the Ceremony the Bride and 
 Bridegroom had set off in a Chaise and four for a 
 Villa near London, from whence it was understood 
 they were very shortly to proceed to Sir George 
 Fauconberg's Seat in the North." 
 
 In the course of time, " the rejoicings with which 
 the happy Pair were received upon their arrival at 
 Fauconberg Manor," were also duly described ; and

 as our old Friends Mrs. Sutton and Miss Drake were 
 known to be then staying in that Neighbourhood, 
 the style in which the detail of these Festivities was 
 given, led many people to suspect that it was the last 
 mentioned Lady who had furnished the Editor of the 
 Newspaper with the matchless Paragraph. 
 
 Sir William Shirley and Emily were re-established 
 at Greyfield when Sir George and Lady Fauconberg 
 came back into that part of the Country. Mr. and 
 Mrs. Vernon and their Daughters, who had accom- 
 panied them on their first return, were gone home, — 
 but Arthur still remained with them. 
 
 Lady Fauconberg imagined they would dread see- 
 ing her, and she experienced a similar sort of feeling 
 herself; but after one interview was over. Sir William 
 seemed to find pleasure in her society as well as in 
 that of her Husband, — and the two Families met 
 frequently. The poor Baronet always enquired kind- 
 ly about Adelaide, yet it was evident that he looked 
 forward with pain to the moment of her expected 
 arrival at her Father's. As soon as her Friend Emily 
 learnt that she was actually come there, she drove

 ADELAIDE. 257 
 
 over to offer her her congratulations in person ; they 
 were both much aifected when they first saw each 
 other, but the meeting* was of course more particu- 
 larly distressing to Emily. She soon got the better 
 of her feelings however, expressed the pleasure it 
 gave her to witness Adelaide's happiness, and finally 
 talked of, (what was almost equally interesting to the 
 Bride,) her own future prospects. 
 
 Miss Shirley had been desired by her Father to 
 invite the whole Party at Fauconberg to dine at 
 Greyfield, but Adelaide considerately declined this 
 
 plan, 
 
 " Sir William," said she, " will I am sure allow 
 me to go and call upon him. Henry is very anxious 
 too to make acquaintance with Captain Vernon. We 
 will spend a long morning with you any day you like 
 to name ; but indeed you ought not to think of Wed- 
 ding Dinners until it is time to give them upon your 
 own account." 
 
 Emily pressed the subject no further, on the con- 
 trary she seemed much relieved by this arrangement. 
 The period of the Visit was fixed. Sir WilHam

 Shirley received Colonel and Mrs. Henry Algernon 
 without betraying any visible emotion, but Adelaide 
 thought that his manner appeared unnatural and re- 
 strained. 
 
 He never afterwards attempted to avoid meeting 
 her, yet it was easy to perceive that he did not feel 
 comfortable when she was present, and that the sight 
 of her always recalled melancholy recollections to his 
 mind. 
 
 Mr. and Mrs. Vernon made another journey to Grey- 
 field in the Spring that they might be present at the 
 Union of their Son and Emily Shirley. The intelli- 
 gence of that Event was the only circumstance that 
 had cast a beam of joy over Julia's dejected spirit 
 since the death of her Brother. But even upon that 
 subject she was destined to receive a severe mortifi- 
 cation, for when she communicated the good news to 
 Horace with an air of triumphant pleasure, — he 
 checked her at once by declaring ' that her Sister's 
 Marriage might perhaps give Her delight but that it 
 was far from affording a cause of satisfaction to Him.^ 
 
 The truth was, Julia had told her Husband that

 ADELAIDE. 259 
 
 Emily had liad a Passion Malheureuse for her Cou- 
 sin, and that her Father had expressed his decided 
 disapprobation of such a connection. He knew that 
 nothing could induce her to act in opposition to Sir 
 William's wishes, and he had consequently taught 
 himself to indulge a selfish hope that she would re- 
 main all her life unmarried, — and that the inheri- 
 tance of Greyfield, (which was an entailed Estate,) 
 would eventually devolve upon Julia. — Impressed as 
 he was with this idea, it was not surprising* that he re- 
 plied so ungraciously to his Wife's announcement of 
 its fallacy. 
 
 For some time Horace's compassion for JuHa's 
 distress had prompted him to treat her with the 
 greatest kindness and attention. He endeavoured by 
 every means in his power to soothe her mind and to 
 amuse her; but when he found that nothing could 
 divert her thoughts, or restore her former gaiety, he 
 began to discover that she was but a dull and melan- 
 choly Companion, and to grow weary of her Society. 
 He fancied that she indulged her regrets and gave 
 way to her grief far more than was necessary-, and as 
 
 R 2

 he felt bored at home, he by decrees got into the 
 constant habit of seeking entertainment elsewhere. 
 He found many old Friends who were still ready 
 to receive him, — the force of habit drew him easily 
 back into his old practices ; and Julia perceived with 
 bitter anguish that if he did not actually dislike her, 
 he had learnt to regard her with the most perfect in- 
 difference. 
 
 She long bore his neglect in silence, but having one 
 day lost her temper under extraordinary provocation, 
 she reproached him keenly for all his unkindness and 
 cruelty. 
 
 Horace's conscience told him that he deserved this 
 reproof, but he had little inclination to bear it. He 
 flew into a violent passion, ' desired his unfortunate 
 Wife to recollect that She had been the cause of 
 banishing him from his Country and bringing him 
 into all his difficulties.' Said ' that she had no right 
 to complain of his going out and leaving her, since 
 she bored him to death by her moping ways when 
 they were together ; and that it was only because he 
 found Her so much less agreable than other people,

 that she did not enjoy more of his company,' Finally 
 he recommended her ' if she was not satisfied with 
 the treatment she received from Him, to return to her 
 own Family.' 
 
 JuHa was too much overcome by tiie cruelty of 
 these taunts to attempt to make any reply, she felt 
 that the misery of her Lot was now complete, but 
 from that moment she determined to submit to it 
 without murmuring. 
 
 Emily and Arthur contrived to bring about a re- 
 concihation between Julia and her Father, he sent 
 her his forgiveness, and she occasionally wrote to 
 him, but she did not wish to see him, and she was 
 glad that Horace expressed no intention of taking 
 her back to England. Solitary and deserted as she 
 found herself Abroad, she could contrive while she 
 remained there to conceal her unhappiness from her 
 Relations and from all the world ; and her own pride, 
 added to her lingering affection for her Husband, 
 made her anxiously desirous to do so.

 been taken so dangerously ill that his life was des- 
 paired of. He told Julia that she must prepare to set 
 out instantly with him for Altamont Castle ; but 
 though they travelled day and night, his Grandfather 
 had expired before they arrived there. Henry and 
 Adelaide, who had attended the poor old Peer during 
 his last moments, were still with Mrs. Algernon. 
 
 " I have no longer any thing to do here," said 
 Henry to his Cousin as he came out upon the steps to 
 receive him, " but to have the pleasure of being the 
 fisrt person to welcome Lord and Lady Altamont to 
 their own House. You have of course heard at the 
 last Stage, that our poor Grandfather has been dead 
 more than a week." 
 
 He had made a great effort to command himself 
 at the beginning of this sentence, but he now became 
 too much affected to be able to utter one word more. 
 He handed Julia very kindly out of the Carriage, 
 but it is impossible to describe how much shocked 
 both he and Adelaide were when they discovered 
 the melancholy change that had taken place in her 
 whole character. Mrs. Algernon could scarcely be-

 lieve that the pale, dis-spirited Person who was now 
 presented to her by her Son ; had once been the bril- 
 liant, lively, hair-brained Daughter-in-La\v, whose 
 wit and gaiety had been described to her in such 
 animated colours; and she wept over her with dis- 
 appointment. 
 
 Henry had little desire to prolong" his stay at Alta- 
 mont Castle after the arrival of his Cousin, and he 
 and Adelaide only remained there a few days to keep 
 up an appearance of cordiality. 
 
 With the exception of the Settlement that had 
 been originally made upon Henry, and an inconsi- 
 derable Legacy to his Wife, devised in very grati- 
 fying terms; Lord Altamont had left the whole of 
 his Property to Horace. — In case of his dying with- 
 out Children, the Family Estates which were very 
 valuable, were strictly entailed upon his Cousin. 
 Horace received them unencumbered by debts of his 
 Grandfather's contracting, but they had already be- 
 come heavily burthened by his own extraveigance ; — 
 and so deeply were his circumstances involved in one 
 way and another, that he found he should only pos-

 sess a nominal income, and acquire the credit of 
 enjoying an inheritance in which he had nothing 
 more than a hfe interest. 
 
 JuHa heard of Ihe large Fortune her Husband had 
 come into, wandered about his fine Place, and looked 
 at every thing around her, with affected pleasure but 
 real indifference. After she had recovered the fatigue 
 of her journey, she tried to assume an air of cheerful- 
 ness, and talked of the different Towns she had visited 
 and the sights she had seen; but all this was evi- 
 dently an effort to her, and she often seemed to be 
 thinking of one subject while she spoke of another. — 
 She could not help forming a painful contrast between 
 Adelaide's happiness and her own melancholy situa- 
 tion. The sight of her fonner Companion vividly 
 recalled the recollection of her earlier and more joy- 
 ful days, and her heart secretly and fondly yearned 
 towards her Father and Emily. 
 
 " My dear Cousin," said she rather suddenly to 
 Adelaide when they were out walking together, '' I 
 want you to talk to me about Greyfield, to tell me 
 about my Father. Is lie well, and in tolerably good 
 spirits ?"

 Adelaide was startled by this question, but she 
 quickly replied, " that she believed Sir Wilhani had 
 never been in better health ; and that although he 
 did not now mix much in general Society, he had 
 always the appearance of being- cheerful and conten- 
 ted in his own Family Circle." 
 
 '' And Emily, dear Emily ;" continued Julia, " I 
 suppose it is not very long since you met, — I need 
 not ask you — for I feel convinced that she is as happy 
 in her Marriage as she deserves to be." 
 
 " She is indeed. And you may imagine what a 
 pleasure it is to me to be able to see her as constantly 
 as I do when I am staying at Fauconberg. — ^You 
 have" added she after a pause, " been frequently 
 the subject of our conversations my dear Julia. Your 
 Father, as well as your Sister and Major Vernon, — 
 feels a warm interest in every thing that concerns 
 you, and I hope the time is not now very distant 
 when you will all meet again." 
 
 " I do not know how that may be," answered 
 Julia, thoughtfully, " there are moments when I feel 
 that I would give the world to sec them, — and then

 at others I imagine that I could not bear to do so. 
 But let us speak no more upon that point at present. 
 — En attendant, I am curious to hear a description of 
 Emily's little Girl. I have often wished to know who 
 and what she is like ?" 
 
 " I think she promises to be extremely like her 
 Mother," replied Adelaide. " She is a very beauti- 
 ful, engaging Child." 
 
 " That is just as it should he," observed Julia. 
 " And the other little Animal ? I suppose it is too 
 young to resemble any thing yet." 
 
 '' You speak very disrespectfully of your Nephew," 
 said Mrs. Henry Algernon, with a smile. " He is I 
 assure you reckoned a Great Personage in his own 
 Family, and is a remarkably fine, handsome Baby." 
 
 '' Oh, I beg the young Gentleman's pardon. I 
 have no doubt he will grow up a wonderful Crea- 
 ture ; and he cannot do better than tread exactly in 
 Arthur's footsteps." 
 
 Then after a pause she continued in a graver tone, — 
 
 " You are blessed with two Children also Ade- 
 laide; I wish you would make me a present of one 
 of your Sons."

 " They are such Treasures," answered Adelaide, 
 " tliat I am afraid I cannot consent to part with either 
 of them. I shall be very proud to shew them to you. 
 I have now left them with my Mother. Poor Lord 
 Altamont was kind enough to wish me to bring them 
 here, but ill as I then knew him to be, it was of course 
 out of the question." 
 
 The appearance of Mrs. Algernon interrupted the 
 conversation, which Julia never afterwards attempted 
 to renew ; indeed she seemed both unwilling* and 
 afraid again to trust herself to talk upon any subject 
 immediately connected with Sir William Shirley or 
 her Sister. 
 
 About a month after the departure of Colonel and 
 Mrs. Henry Algernon, Lord Altamont remarked one 
 mornins; at breakfast, that he found he had affairs to 
 settle which must take him very speedily up to Lon- 
 don. Then addressing himself more particularly to 
 Julia; he said ' ihat as it was now the gay Season, 
 and her deep mourning would prevent her appearing 
 much in public, — he could not ask her to do so stupid 
 a thing as to go with him. That he thought it would

 be much better and more agreable for her to remain 
 in the Country with his Mother during his absence.' 
 
 Juha made no objection to this arrangement. She 
 had not the shghtest desire to enter again into the 
 London World, but it was a deep mortification to her 
 to discover that her Husband did not wish her to ac- 
 company him in his Journey. 
 
 He had latterly treated her with much more out- 
 ward kindness and attention, and she had fondly flat- 
 tered herself that the affection he had once professed 
 for her, was beginning to revive; but his present 
 conduct entirely undeceived her, and destroyed the 
 pleasing illusion. 
 
 She learnt by degrees that it would probably be 
 her fate to spend the greatest portion of her future 
 time tete-a-tete with her Mother-in-Law at Altamont 
 Castle. Horace was very seldom there, he was not 
 fond of the Place, and whenever he went away he 
 contrived to find some excuse for leaving his Wife at 
 home. In short he only favoured her with his society 
 for a few weeks during the Shooting Season, when he 
 brought down a Party of Gentlemen to join him in 
 enjoying the Sport.

 Lady Altamont's delicate health formed the plea 
 for her seclusion, but it was generally suspected that 
 her mind had been so completely unsettled by her 
 misfortunes, and that she had become so flighty and 
 odd, that it was impossible to allow her to appear in 
 society. — And in truth such was the secret impres- 
 sion which induced Horace to immure her within the 
 precincts of his own remote Domain. He was bored 
 with her himself, he never wished to find himself in 
 her company: — But had he thought her capable of 
 deriving enjoyment from any sort of gaiety, he would 
 have been very glad to know that she went out, and 
 that she pleased herself in her own way. 
 
 Emily's active kindness afforded her Sister an early 
 opportunity of renewing her intercourse with her Fa- 
 mily, but she declined for many years to profit by 
 
 this advantage ; and except one painful interview 
 with her Father, she saw very little of any of them 
 
 till after the death of her Husband. 
 
 The account Mrs. Arthur Vernon had heard of 
 Julia, after her Friend Adelaide returned from Alta- 
 
 mont Castle, made her feel so uncomfortable about

 270 ADELAIDE. 
 
 her, that she determined to attempt to see her as 
 speedily as possible. 
 
 As soon as she learnt that Lord Altamont was in 
 London, she made up her mind to seek instead of to 
 avoid meeting- him; and having accidentally disco- 
 vered that he was engaged to dine with his Cousin, 
 she told Arthur that it was her intention to go and 
 spend the evening with Adelaide who had a small 
 Party at home, and no engagement afterwards ; and 
 she begged him to join her there when he came away 
 from a Military Dinner to which he had been in- 
 vited. 
 
 Adelaide, who was unconscious of Emily's plan, 
 had asked Horace much about Lady Altamont. 
 
 " I enquire the more particularly," said she, " be- 
 cause Mrs. Arthur Vernon, who was with me yester- 
 day, is so very anxious to hear every thing I can tell 
 her of her Sister." 
 
 " Is Sir William Shirley now in Town ?" de- 
 manded Lord Altamont. 
 
 " No/' replied Adelaide. " He will come up for 
 a short time I believe, next month."

 ADELAIDE. 271 
 
 " I would call upon Mrs. Vernon/' observed Ho- 
 race, thouglitfully, '' if I imagined that it would not 
 be disagreable to her to see me." 
 
 " On the contrary, I will venture to assure you," 
 answered Mrs. Algernon, " that you would be a wel- 
 come Guest. — ^That your visit would afford a great 
 relief to her mind." 
 
 Adelaide's look of surprise, almost of dismay, when 
 Mrs. Arthur Vernon was announced, — convinced Ho- 
 race that her appearance at that moment was no pre- 
 concerted scheme of hers. He was much startled 
 himself; and though Emily evidently felt extremely 
 nervous at seeing him, she held out her hand to him 
 in so cordial a manner, that nobody present would 
 have suspected it was the first time they had met since 
 his return to England. 
 
 Lord Altamont allowed his Sister-in-Law a few 
 minutes to regain her composure, and then drew a 
 chair close to hers. 
 
 '' I had but just been informed," he began, " of 
 your arrival in Town ; and our Hostess will tell you 
 that I had already consulted her upon the propriety

 272 ADELAIDE. 
 
 of my presenting myself at your door. Your kind 
 reception of me here, encourages me to hope that I 
 should not be turned away from it." 
 
 Emily replied, " That She and Major Vernon 
 would be very glad to receive him whenever he liked 
 to come. I wish to forget the past;" she added, 
 " And we must all now only recollect how nearly we 
 are related to one another." 
 
 The conversation naturally turned upon Julia. 
 
 " I fear," observed Mrs. Vernon, " that she is very 
 far from well." 
 
 " I do not think," returned Lord Altamont, " that 
 her health is greatly affected, her malady is I appre- 
 hend much more upon her mind. I have never hinted 
 this in words to any person but j^ourself, yet it is 
 perceptible enougli to those who happen to be with 
 her. — ^You are probably aware that she had a dread- 
 ful brain fever soon after her Marriage. The strength 
 of her constitution enabled her to recover the bodily 
 attack, but her intellect was so severely shaken, that 
 it has not since, nor ever will regain its former clear- 
 ness."

 ADELAIDE. 273 
 
 " I had suspected something of this," said Emily, 
 who appeared much distressed by what she had just 
 heard. 
 
 " But do you imagine the evil is quite beyond all 
 remedy ?" 
 
 " I am afraid it is," answered Horace. " In such 
 a case an appeal to medical skill is of course out of 
 the question. I have ineffectually tried every possi- 
 ble change of place and scene. And as to bringing 
 her here, and attempting to induce her to go into 
 public, it strikes me that such a plan would be far 
 from proving either desirable or judicious." 
 
 Mrs. Arthur Vernon assented to the truth of this 
 reasoning. 
 
 " I should very much like to see poor JuHa," 
 added she. "Major Vernon is going down to Ply- 
 mouth next week to meet his Brother, and if you 
 thought that a visit from me would be a comfort to 
 my Sister, I know that he would then very readily 
 contrive to take me to Altamont Castle, and bring me 
 back again to Town after he had accomplished the 
 purpose of his own Journey."

 ''■ Your proposal is indeed most kindly devised," 
 replied Lord Altamont. " And if any thing in the 
 world can yet be of service to Julia, I am sure it will 
 be a visit from You. Whenever you have made 
 your arrangements I will write to her upon the sub- 
 ject, it will perhaps be better that she should have 
 but a short notice of your approach. Believe me I 
 shall feel sincere pleasure in knowing that you are 
 my guest, and I only regret that it will not be in my 
 power to be at home to receive Major Vernon my- 
 self." 
 
 When Arthur returned from his Dinner Party, he 
 was not a little astonished to learn how Emily's even- 
 ing had been employed. He rejoiced to find that 
 she had so ably accomplished what he was aware had 
 long been the wish of her heart, and he instantly 
 agreed to facilitate her putting the project she had 
 suggested into speedy execution. 
 
 It would be impossible to describe the feelings of 
 the two Sisters when they met again under circum- 
 stances so widely different from those in which they 
 had been placed when they last parted. — For a brief

 space Emily's presence seemed to have restored Julia 
 to her former self, her sorrows appeared to be for- 
 gotten, and she talked and laughed with something 
 like her original gaiety. But when Mrs. Vernon in 
 the kindest and most delicate manner, ventured to 
 express a hope of seeing her at some future period at 
 Greyfield ; her air and tone became suddenly changed. 
 " No, dearest Emily," exclaimed she, in a hurried 
 melancholy voice, " I can never go to Greyfield, — I 
 could not bear it — it would kill me ! When Horace 
 comes back I shall ask him to take me to London for 
 a little while, — ^perhaps a week — that I may endea- 
 vour to see my Father once more ; and my Husband 
 is so kind that I am sure he will not refuse me such a 
 request. — You must not imagine I am ungracious, or 
 suppose that I undervalue the happiness of seeing you, 
 because I cannot make up my mind to visit you un- 
 der my Father's roof. I shall have no pleasure so 
 great as the hope of occasionally meeting You and 
 Arthur, and one or two other People, elsewhere. — 
 As for what is called society, I have given it up ; I 
 am not now fit for it. It would bore me to make new

 Friends, and I should not dare to look my old ones in 
 the face." 
 
 "• I suppose, " said Emily, endeavouring" to give a 
 turn to her ideas, " that Lord Altamont intends to live 
 principally here ?" 
 
 " I do not yet know," replied Julia hastily, " Yes, 
 I dare say we shall. At any rate, if I do not change 
 my present opinion, (which it is probable enough that 
 I may do,) /shall prefer remaining the greatest part 
 of the year at this place, to removing to any other. 
 I have every thing I can want or wish for here. Mrs. 
 Algernon takes all sort of trouble off my hands ; and 
 I am only called upon to act the part of Miladi la 
 Maitresse in my old Chateau, without being plagued 
 with any of the cares of inspecting or directing the 
 menage." 
 
 Emily found that her Sister was determined to give 
 her the impression that Lord Altamont was an excel- 
 lent Husband, and that she was perfectly satisfied and 
 contented with the lot she had chosen for herself. 
 Neither she or Arthur were entirely deceived by her 
 representations, but they thought it would be their 
 kindest plan to lead her to imagine that they were so.

 They left A.ltamont Castle with the comfortable 
 idea that their visit had gratified her, and soothed her 
 mind ; — And it was also a relief to them to have ascer- 
 tained that they had done all that was in their power 
 towards alleviating those sorrows which were far too 
 deeply rooted ever to be forgotten. 
 
 Sir William Shirley did not live a great many 
 years after the death of his Son. The shock of that 
 Event had imperceptibly undermined his health, and 
 contributed to shorten his days. Deeply as he had 
 suffered from the misconduct and misfortunes of his 
 other Children, he had the consolation of retaining the 
 society of Emily. Her attentions, and Arthur's soothed 
 him during his last moments, and he had the comfort 
 of leaving them surrounded by every blessing the 
 world could afford. 
 
 Lord Altamont's wild exti'avagance kept him in 
 continual distress and embaiTassment. The pei'plex- 
 ing confusion of his affairs; the mortifications and 
 disappointments to which he was frequently subjected; 
 and above all, his own bitter and self-reproaching 
 reflections, — led him to plunge even deeper than he

 had hitherto done into Gaming and every other spe- 
 cies of dissipation. And his selfish and unprincipled 
 Career of vice and folly, was at length prematurely 
 terminated by a desperate and violent death. 
 
 Julia, who in spite of his neglect, still loved him 
 with a childish and extravagant affection; was in- 
 consolable at his loss. This new grief considerably 
 aggravated her mental infirmity. She determined to 
 shut herself up in a Cottage close to Altamont Castle ; 
 and it was a long time before either her Sister or 
 Adelaide could persuade her to break through her 
 resolution, and establish herself in an Abode more 
 suitable to her rank and situation. 
 
 Of Colonel and Mrs. Henry Algernon it is merely 
 necessary to say, that their long and severe trials 
 were succeeded by a very extended continuance of 
 greater prosperity and happiness than falls to the 
 share of most people. 
 
 Adelaide entirely regained her health and beauty. 
 Her Sons were particularly promising youths, and 
 her Daughters grew up as lovely and as amiable as 
 herself Worldly advantages seemed to be showered

 down upon her and upon Henry in every shape ; 
 since in addition to what they akeady possessed, the 
 Title and Estates of Altamont devolved upon the 
 latter at his Cousin's decease. — And as it was one of 
 Sir George Fauconberg's liberal maxims not to ap- 
 prove of too great an accumulation of riches; the 
 Settlement of his own Property was so an-anged by 
 his Will, — that Fauconberg Manor with all its broad 
 Lands, was to descend to the Second Son of Lord and 
 Lady Altamont, whenever his elder Brother became 
 possessed by inheritance of his Father's Peerage and 
 his Paternal Estates annexed to it. 
 
 THE END.
