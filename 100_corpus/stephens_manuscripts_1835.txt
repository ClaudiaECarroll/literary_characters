CHAPTER

 Suppose we resume our narrative, just where Maxi- 
 milian Pereny sprung, from where he was stationed near 
 Bathori, to encounter some one or other, who, he con- 
 cluded, had ensconced himself, within the convenient 
 shadow of a neighbouring porch. 
 
 On reaching the spot, his eyes searched out the 
 moving figure of a man, in the extreme gloom, who 
 seemed in the act of retiring. Maximilian, without an 
 instant's deliberation, darting before the stranger, to 
 intercept his supposed purpose, accosted him, in his 
 accustomed overbearing language. The man, at first, 
 made no reply, but eyed his questioner, for a moment, 
 from head to foot, in silence, and with an air of con- 
 tempt. He himself, was clad in a kind of half Walla- 
 chian, half national garb, an equipment which, how- 
 ever unprofessional and unassured, was not especially

 remarkable at a time, that Hermanstadt, owing to the 
 confluence of adventurers, known and unknown, teemed 
 with every variety of national costume. The Walla- 
 chian mantle, with its facings of fur, did not wholly 
 hide the ornamented hose, of the brightest blue, and 
 the doliman, or jacket, with its innumerable silver but- 
 tons. In one respect, his appearance might warrant 
 circumspection, his features being hidden behind a dark 
 vizor, which closed under the immense brimmed hat, 
 that slouched over his shoulders. 
 
 " Show your face, poltroon!" such was the pleasant 
 salutation of the highly polished Obergespann.* 
 
 "Away, fool!" was the no less polite rejoinder, re- 
 torted, after a minute's pause, in a low, and somewhat 
 disguised tone. 
 
 *' Fool ! " repeated Maximilian, stung to instant rage, 
 and his ready weapon leaped from its scabbard : " Fool ! 
 big words ! thou shalt draw thinner breath anon." 
 
 The other was equally prompt. Without further pre- 
 amble, the two were engaged in deadly strife : but it 
 was soon made evident, that the aggressor, though an 
 excellent swordsman, was no match for his more prac- 
 tised, or more skilful opponent. Ere Bathori, who, at 
 the first clash, had hastened to the rescue, could come 
 up, their bright swords had flashed across — a pass. The 
 unknown backed a single pace ; then " his poignant 
 spear he thrust, with puissant sway," * and the nephew 
 of the regent of Hungary, was struck to the earth. Ba- 
 thori reached the spot, but the victor, under cover of 
 the darkness, had already betaken himself to flight. 
 The wounded man was conveyed into the nearest habi- 
 tation, which happened, ('*so the devil ordained") to 
 be the humble tenement of Hubert. 
 
 Veronica, with some ceremonial of politeness, received 
 the baron and his luckless charge, on their entrance, at the 
 
 * Obergespann, — an Hungarian title, nearly equivalent to graf.

 threshold. Her ears had been startled by the conflict with- 
 out, and her first glance, at the disabled combatant, disco- 
 vered an apology for his intrusion. Yet was there more 
 than one reason, why the daughter of Hubert, instinctively, 
 shrunk back, on perceiving, whom fate had ordained lier 
 guests. In Bathori, she recalled the person of the offi- 
 cer, who had attached her unhappy sire, and whose 
 presence, could hardly fail to revive the affliction of the 
 overnight: whilst the fantastic array of his bleeding 
 companion, reminded her of the impertinent, who, on 
 that very afternoon, had addressed her, in such indecorous 
 terms, while traversing one of the corridors of the castle. 
 
 But, when did the claims of humanity make -a vain ap- 
 peal to the feeling heart of woman ? The painful associ- 
 ations connected with the sight of the baron,' — the mai- 
 denly antipathy towards the young graf, in which she 
 might otherwise have indulged, were alike swallowed up, 
 in the consideration, that a fellow-creature, perhaps 
 wounded to death, required what hospitality, and aid she 
 could render. She therefore controlled the weaker feel- 
 ings of her nature, and acceded to Bathori's hurried re- 
 quest, for permission to bear the bleeding knight under 
 her roof, in a kindly spirit, only qualified by the recol- 
 lection of her peculiar and unprotected state, which, 
 however, it might temper the cordiality of her compli- 
 ance, did not extinguish it. 
 
 Maximilian having been laid upon the low pallet of 
 Hubert, came to himself, and not long after, his hurt 
 was examined by one, to whom the ars rnedicandi, or leach 
 craft, was a privileged profession, — a youthful sister of 
 charity, — " qui se disposoit a conserver toujours intact, 
 le lys precieux de la virginite,*" and whose convent was 
 at no great distance.

 lian were pronounced immaterial, and the application of 
 certain vulnerary remedies, followed by quiet and repose, 
 comprised all that was needful, to ascertain his speedy reco- 
 very. Meanwhile, such ordinary skill, in the healing art, as 
 the cenobitical maid pretended to, she put into requisition ; 
 and managed matters so well, as to get herself established 
 sole ministress of the sick bed-chamber. The prognos- 
 tics of his gentle, and charitable nurse, were happily ve- 
 rified. On the morning of the third day of his confine- 
 ment, the noble patient arose, and like " a needless Alex- 
 andrine," weathered the narrow passage, conducting to 
 the front apartment of the lowly habitation; the same, 
 where we laid the scene of an earlier manuscript. 
 
 Veronica, who had that instant returned from her custom- 
 ary visiting her father, modestly stood at the room door, 
 to congratulate the invalid on his convalescence, — and, 
 perhaps, if a painter could have chosen his minute, to 
 catch and embody the conflicting graces of the blushing 
 girl, that would have been it, — a figure more lovely, or 
 more striking, than that, which she exhibited, it were 
 hard to find. The natural timidity, which the novelty 
 of her situation, and the native delicacy of her sex, in- 
 duced, became blended with that becoming confidence, 
 which the remembrance of the relative position of hostess 
 and guest, — of the obliger, and the person under obliga- 
 tion, warranted her entertaining, — and, over all, was 
 thrown the eloquent expression of an embarrassing con- 
 sciousness, deepened by the rich glow, that her walk 
 from the citadel never failed to spread, over the ideal 
 translucency of her complexion. She had just laid aside 
 her dolman, or mantle of martin skin, under which she 
 wore, with an air of neatness and care, that was far 
 from common, the ordinary garb of the magyar maidens. 
 Her luxuriant locks were braided, and disposed on her 
 head, in the form of a coronal, and it escaped not the 
 observation of Pereny, that her rank in life did not en- 
 title her to assume the ornamented Pasta, the indispen-

 sable coiffure of females of gentle blood.* Her jacket was 
 composed of the finest wool, profusely decorated with 
 ribbons. It parted low over the fragrant bosomfj to 
 show the lace front of her bodice, which was clasped or 
 buttoned, by variously coloured glass beads, and which 
 set off the round, and faultless symmetry of her bust, and 
 figure. Two strings of unpolished opals, from the an- 
 cient mines of Czewernitza, shed a scintillating bright- 
 ness, over the snowy circle of the neck, they hung from. 
 The graceful tunic fitted close to the shape, until it 
 reached the waist, where it was secured by a ribbon, in 
 the form of a girdle; it was cut short at the shoulders, and, 
 scarcely descending below the knees, was edged round the 
 skirt, by a narrow sort of galloon, to correspond with 
 the lace bordering of the Szoknyaban, whose floating 
 linen sleeves left the moulded arm at graceful freedom. 
 The neatly plaited kirtle, as clear from stain, as her own 
 innocent heart, peeped, for a few inches, below the vest. 
 Her feet were contained in boots of yellow leather, so 
 small, you'd have said, had you seen them, they might 
 match the fabled slippers of the classic Doricha.| This 
 national costume would appear to bear no small resem- 
 blance, in respect to liberality of display, to the well- 
 known style of our fair grandmothers, from the days of 
 Charles^ down to the middle of the last century. 
 
 If Addison were not so indelicate a writer, we would 
 here quote his strictures thereon, but, as it is, we prefer 
 referring the gentle reader to the papers of the Guardian, 
 Nos. 100 and 109. 
 
 Our lovely hostess, having expressed her satisfaction,

 at finding her guest, in such a fair way of recovery, de- 
 corously hinted her hopes, that he would shortly make it 
 convenient, to remove his quarters. 
 
 '' During your detention here," observed the scrupu- 
 lous maiden, with ablush of feminine timidity, '* a perfect 
 cure can hardly be looked for, but I trust, ha Isten a 
 karja,'^ that tendment more meet, and other appurten- 
 ances, better fitting yourcondition, will, in no distant day, 
 completely restore you." 
 
 We believe, we have mentioned, somewhere or other, 
 that the notes of Veronica's voice, were clear and melo- 
 dious (''an excellent thing in woman"), and whilst the 
 atmosphere caught the music of her breath, and her 
 modest irresolution, and innate grace, threw over the pre- 
 sent association of her life, the halo of a redeeming, and 
 tutelary power: it was no wonder, that to the entranced 
 senses of her hearer, the very soul of oratory seemed dis- 
 solved into a spell, since, with such accompaniments, the 
 merest prattling might have passed for eloquence. 
 
 So forcibly was Maximilian struck, that, at first, his 
 wonted audacity failed him. He was unversed in the 
 language of respectful love, and it was not until after 
 some embarrassed moments, that he thankfully acknow- 
 ledged the prompt hospitality afforded him, to which he 
 declared, it was his opinion, he owed his recovery; and 
 he ended, by requesting to be informed, in what way he 
 could best evince the sincerity of his gratitude. — Oh ! 
 the mighty witchery of woman's charms, when conse- 
 crated by virtue and intelligence! — when the simple 
 graces, which set them oflP, speak out the modesty of the 
 mind! — What is like unto it? What can come up to 
 its wonders? What limit its jurisdiction? It is supreme 
 and invincible ; and whilst there throbs one manly heart, 
 attuned to the religion of nature, it will make that heart 
 the theatre of its triumphs, and the sanctuary of its rites. 
 Veronica, in reply to the graf's demand, quietly ob-

 served; '' that the circumstance, of having been of any 
 service to a fellow-creature, would reward itself, and 
 that she cared not for other recompence." 
 
 '' Oh! say not so," exclaimed Maximilian, with fer- 
 vour ; " I can never sufficiently testify my gratitude. To 
 your courtesy, fair maiden, I feel persuaded it is owing, 
 that I exist. Would that I might be allowed to conse- 
 crate the future energies of my life, to thy beauty and to 
 thy service !" 
 
 A shade of something, not very remote from displea- 
 sure, coursed o'er the clear brow, and kindled in the 
 cheek of Veronica. The manner and language of the 
 graf made her wish the interview shortened, and, drawing 
 herself up, in maidenly reserve, she coldly answered, 
 " You must excuse me, sir stranger, if, under the peculiar 
 circumstances, in which I am placed, with reverence be 
 it spoken, I decline further personal communication. I 
 need not say, I shall be glad to hear of your perfect re- 
 covery — allow me to withdraw." 
 
 Maximilian felt somewhat nettled, and did not imme- 
 diately reply. Veronica passed across the room, but, 
 ere she reached the inner doorway, the graf seized her, by 
 the slender wrist : *' Stay," he exclaimed, with the de- 
 ferential air of suppliant humility, although the tones of 
 his voice were those of superiority, and command — " stay, 
 and listen to what I have to offer ; why should you fly 
 from one, who adores you ? — why scorn a heart your 
 invincible charms have subjected to your will? — 
 
 why " 
 
 But here Veronica, with the native dignity of an out- 
 raged, and elevated spirit, interposed. " Unhand me, 
 sir !" she exclaimed, whilst her heart propelled the tide 
 of life, with violence, to her cheek. " This is to return 
 insult for the benefit, which you would have me to be- 
 lieve has elicited your gratitude ; I insist upon your de- 
 taining me no longer." 
 
 Maximilian met her dilating eye, while she was speak- 
 ing, with a look of libertine admiration. " Adorable crea-

 ture !" he replied, not heeding her remonstrance ; ** why 
 not have let me perish of my wounds, rather than have 
 preserved me, to inflict a crueller death, by those bright 
 orbs, whose every glance is a stab — it had been better — 
 kinder." 
 
 Veronica's respiration quickened, and her face over- 
 spread, with a still higher glow. " I cannot reply to this," 
 she said, striving to withdraw her hand ; '' you take an 
 unworthy advantage of my unprotected state. I appeal 
 to your humanity to unloose me." 
 
 Maximilian gazed upon the maiden, the heaving of 
 whose beautiful breast, flushed cheeks, and glistening 
 eyes, attested the reality of her anger. " Nay," she pre- 
 sently added, with an air of dignity, and fixing on her 
 audacious companion an overpowering glance — " you 
 hurt me, sir." 
 
 Maximilian shrunk before the lustre of those eyes, 
 heightened, and rendered irresistible, by the overflowings 
 of an indignant heart, and, instantly loosening his hold, 
 he threw himself at her feet. *' Oh, pardon, maiden, if 
 my fingers pressed too roughly " he began ; but Ve- 
 ronica, without further regarding him, silently moved 
 away. 
 
 " Sure, ne'er before, dwelt cruelty in so sweet shaped a 
 temple," he continued; but here he paused, for the ob- 
 ject, unto whom he addressed himself, had already 
 reached the door. Instantly, and abruptly he exclaimed, 
 " Madam, your father !" 
 
 He had struck the right chord — that word was the 
 key note to all the sympathies, hopes, and apprehen- 
 sions, clinging to the heart of the maiden, who stopped 
 short in the doorway, as if the syllables she heard, had a 
 spell in them, to rivet her to the spot ; she turned her 
 head, and the eye of Maximilian Pereny, with lawless 
 fixure, fed upon the most exquisite outline of her fair 
 cheek, where her filial feelings were fast chasing the 
 rich Vermillion, which indignation had just elicited.

 " What of my father?" she inquired, struggling with 
 herself to speak with calmness. 
 
 " Come back, loveliest of human beings, and I will 
 inform you," answered the graf. 
 
 It was not easy for Veronica to assume even the ap- 
 pearance of composure. Instinctively, she moved three 
 paces nearer, where her unmannered companion knelt, 
 and again halted ; but her moistened glance was on the 
 floor, and the immobility of the long eye -lashes, shading 
 more than one-half of the pupil, hid from Maximilian the 
 expression of her thoughts ; her depressed countenance, 
 however, and amiable confusion, only augmented her 
 attractions. " Now, then," she said, with as much firm- 
 ness, as she could assume, " what would you tell me 
 respecting my father ?" 
 
 *' He is in prison," said Maximilian. 
 
 " Alas ! I know it too well," returned the maiden ; 
 " but what is that to the purpose ? — Can'st thou set him 
 free?" 
 
 ''That I can," said Maximilian, rising, and approach- 
 ing nearer the anxious girl. 
 
 '^Ha!" she exclaimed, looking up, and discovering 
 features of the hue of death, " is it veritable ?" 
 
 " Veritable ! ay, by my knightly faith, is it," replied 
 the other. While he spoke, he again seized the maiden 
 by the hand, that had dropped listless by her side. 
 
 The action aroused Veronica to a renewed sense of her 
 situation ; a heightened tint spread over her brow, as if 
 the fountains of her heart had been diverted thither from 
 their natural channels — her eyes were fast filling with 
 tears, as, struggling to disengage herself, she said, " This 
 is ungenerous — loosen my hand, and I will hear all you 
 would deliver." 
 
 " Severest of thy sex !" cried the rude voluptuary, 
 speaking with much gesticulation, and imprinting kisses 
 on the delicate fingers, he held in custody, — " Jn me you

 slave, and pledge you his freedom, on the word of a 
 king, — a king, my angel, do you observe, that is to be, — 
 and thou, most enchanting of thy sex ! shalt divide titles

 and took a step or two, with conscious elevation, ere he 
 continued, with increasing earnestness. " In requital 
 for such benefits, edes kintsem* I only ask one favour, 
 though, therein I own is comprised a treasure, which not 
 Plutus' white exchequer might outmatch, — nay, not the

 be mine hereafter — only this one return, I claim in 
 charity." 
 
 " What is it?" said the maiden, who, as far as she 
 might, strove to conceal that excessive agitation, which 
 her rapidly panting boddice betrayed, in spite of her. 
 
 "Thyself! fair creature," cried the unprincipled liber- 
 tine, as he threw his arms round her shrinking form, and 
 profaned her vermillion lips, " that ne'er had been sighed 
 on by any before," with the repeated pressure of his own.

 On those lips he passionately clung, " like a bee, ine- 
 briated with the nectar of flowers." * 
 
 The damsel struggled in his rude embrace, and her 
 eyes sparkled, through tears of resentment. She feebly 
 shrieked, while the flush of blood reddened from her 
 clear, marbly brow and cheek, even down to those 
 chaste and vestal urns, which, like unto the "monu- 
 mental alabaster," on the holy altar of St. Maria, glowed 
 " transparent, with the colour of fire."t Like the round- 
 ed snow, drifting in, and reflecting the crimson hues 
 of sunset, flashed, ever and anon, her bosom above the 
 stomacher; revealing to Maximilian, by its palpitation, 
 how deeply she felt the indignity.

 Rendered its panting whiteness more confessed."}: 
 
 Exerting the vehement force which outraged modesty 
 lent her, she at length disjoined herself from his em- 
 brace, and precipitately retired. 
 
 '' So !" thought the young graf, '' a very crystal rock 
 of chastity, our dainty hostess; what a confounded diffi- 
 culty the damoiselle raises at a salute, from our honour- 
 able mouth. By my uncle's hat ! an she coy it so at

 broken by the entrance of the ancient housekeeper, Ju- 
 dith, who directed her masculine strides across the 
 chamber, to the low outlet, which issued into the street. 
 There was an oddness in her straggling gait and walk, 
 which struck the inquisitive gaze of Maximilian with 
 wonder. She was roughly clad : over a stomacher of 
 leather, hung a coarse woollen garment, fastened by a 
 slight inkle, which also served to suspend two stiff aprons 
 of striped cloth, one before, and the other behind. Her 
 legs were bare, almost from her knees ; but round her 
 feet were wrapped a sort of sandals, cut out of raw 
 leather, and secured, from the instep to the calf of the 
 leg, by reticulated thongs, a common substitute for shoes, 
 and called opintschen. A string of glass beads, worn 
 around her neck, reached so low as the girdle. She had 
 draperied her head with a sort of turban, formed of an 
 immense square fillet of cloth, that had once been untar- 
 nished, the folds of which, rolling loosely over her fore- 
 head and ears, even to the shoulder, almost shrouded her 
 declining countenance. On either side this turhant were 
 two or three great bosses, set with stones, and the like 
 hung from her ears. She stooped abominably, but even 
 so, her height considerably exceeded the ordinary stature 
 of her sex ; and the amplitude of her dimensions, in 
 other respects, was far from common. A sort of scrip, 
 suspended from her shoulders, completed her adjust- 
 ment. 
 
 Maximilian perceived, from the first, that she was a 
 Wallachian. "Stirring abroad, eh, good mother ?" he 
 s^id ; but finding the old dame passed on without notice, 
 oi' reply, he added, as his hand was on the latch, " Tarry 
 awhile ; whither speed you, in the fiend's name ?" 
 
 " To the citadel," replied the dame, but without turn- 
 ing her head — " with a dish of mamalinga,* and a bottle

 of mead, for Captain Hubert. Prithee, suffer me to 
 leave you, for I am aweary till my diurnal task is done, 
 and, at my age, I have no great vigour to spare. Yet I 
 repine not, but rather rejoice me on my way. My father, 
 sir knight, when alive, was of the land of the Carabog- 
 dana, * and now he is feasting on jnate f finer than 
 Keskemeth's. % 'Tis the lot of mortality to suffer, and to 
 be reviled, as I have been ; but the next world, I doubt 
 not, will vindicate our Lady's justice, in the evidence of 
 her goodness — I can wait." 
 
 Maximilian gazed on the old woman in wonder. Her 
 language seemed to him at variance with her lowly desti- 
 nation. '' Good woman," he cried, " can it be, that I 
 hear right? Were those words thine? Untutored, wi- 
 thered, and worn— to all appearance a very weed, beneath 
 the stream of time ; so sunk and rooted, in the depths of 
 its waves, that storm or calm can matter little to thee — 
 thou shouldst be gentle, dame. May I die ere I be 
 crowned kiral, if my uncle could preach more to the 
 purpose ! Art not above thy show ? ha, confess now ?" 
 
 " Thy uncle, sir knight?" 
 
 " Ay, Cardinal Martinuzzi has that honour, old lady," 
 returned Pereny, proudly. 
 
 " 'Twas by his eminence's orders that Captain Hubert 
 was arrested," said the ancient dame, rather in the tone 
 of one who was laying down a proposition, for her own 
 consideration, than as if addressing her companion. 
 
 " I should suppose so," returned Maximilian ; "since 
 the attachments for high treason are usually counter- 
 signed by the regent." 
 
 The old housekeeper, as if governed by a sudden im- 
 pulse, let fall her hand from the latch of the door, and 
 turned back some paces nearer where Maximilian was

 stationed. '^ Say, wilt thou deliver a message from me 
 to thy uncle ?" she demanded. 
 
 "From thee!" exclaimed the graf, scornfully, yet 
 with symptoms of surprise. 
 
 ''Yes, sir knight; tell him — but first let me make 
 sure, that child is out of hearing." Saying these words, 
 the housekeeper quitted the apartment. 
 
 " This is a queer business," quoth Maximilian, when 
 he was left alone. "I have been entertained with a most 
 delectable tete-a-tete, truly ; but the denouement is yet 
 to come. Bah ! there was more sport, looking love 
 at my cloistered nurse, though I am as yet too weak 
 to make it. By my troth ! she does not seem one to 
 souse her szoknyaban, after the fashion of St. Angela. * 
 Now, for being let into the confidence of this harridan ; 
 she means something deeper, than I can fathom; her 
 manner, methought, was mysterious ; I'll hear her un- 
 foldings, for the joke's sake. I convey a message to my 
 uncle ! ha, ha, ha I My uncle, who fancies, from Bathori's 
 communication, that I am all this while in Hungary, 
 spying out the disposition of the Austrian levies ! Well, 
 at all events, I must contrive to insinuate myself into the 
 old lady's favour; for only thereby can I gain her to 
 assist my ends on my dainty hostess yonder." 
 
 The graf's cogitations were here interrupted, by the 
 return of the housekeeper ; who, closing the door after 
 her, paused for an instant, in the act of listening, and 
 then advanced close to Maximilian. 
 
 "I am about to lodge in you a secret — canst thou 
 keep it ?" she asked, in tones, which her hearer thought 
 sounded peculiarly strange and solemn. 
 
 " Undoubtedly, if I see cause,'' replied Maximilian.

 '' Come, come, my good woman," said the graf, " this 
 won't pass. Tell me, in a word, the message, you would 
 have me deliver to my uncle, and let's have done our 
 fooling." 
 
 " 1 ask you again," returned the ronion of a house- 
 keeper — '* will you swear ?" 
 
 '^ Any thing to oblige thee ; — I swear," replied the graf. 
 
 " 'Tis well — ha! but heed your oath; for if you do 
 
 not sir knight, I'll tell you a short tale. I knew a man 
 
 who was once plunged, as thou art, in a tremendous 
 vow — but he kept that ; yes, he kept that — hitherto, — 
 hitherto. He swore, besides, never to set his foot in his 
 native land : — this oath he violated. Assuming the dis- 
 guise of a common mercenary soldier, he ventured back 
 to Erdely; — he showed himself, in the open, public 
 streets, in Hermanstadt. One night — the hour was 
 midnight — the moon hid her face — the dark clouds ga- 
 thered over the earth — not a breath stole on the ear, 
 save the hoarse booming of the bitterns in the flats, that 
 margin the River Olt, when — you know the jagged range 
 of rock, which fronts the citadel of Hermanstadt ?" 
 
 " Certainly," said Maximilian, impressed, in spite of 
 himself, with strange awe, at the manner, and voice of 
 the old dame. 
 
 "■ Then learn, on that same precipice, the man I mean, 
 at the hour I mentioned, kept guard, when a villie, a 
 pure and spectral bride — " 
 
 " What dost thou prate of?" interrupted Maximilian, 
 at the same time, involuntarily starting, — " of whom do 
 you speak ?" 
 
 '' Of whom? — what, you remember the tale ? That sen- 
 tinel then, is — was, I would say — my brother, sir knight." 
 *' Your brother, woman !" ejaculated the graf, starting 
 at the announcement. 
 
 " As I have told you," rejoined the female; " and it

 is from him I would thank you to bear a message, to the 
 Cardinal Martinuzzi." 
 
 " You are raving ! — 'tis many years since that man's 
 mortal fate was sealed." 
 
 " Nevertheless, I am in possession of his secret, which 
 I must whisper in your uncle's ear. — Say, then, to his 
 eminence, that, on my brother Albert's being made 
 away with, he left an account of certain transactions 
 behind him." 
 
 " With thee ?" said Maximilian. 
 
 '*= No matter with whom; — merely mention, I know 
 the tale he had to tell, respecting the Princess Beatrice's 
 murder and abduction, and which, but for his disap- 
 pearance from his cell, on the day appointed for his ex- 
 amination, he would have published to all the world." 
 
 For some time, there was mutual silence, which 
 Maximilian Pereny was the first to break. " I know 
 not how to act in this," he returned. " What you say, 
 touching the Princess Beatrice, demands investigation ; 
 but, whether I ought to bear your message, I much 
 doubt. Nevertheless, I will do so, were it only for my 
 lost sire's interest in that transaction ; but, mark me, 
 it is only on one condition. You must understand, my 
 good woman," he proceeded, in a coaxing tone, on ob- 
 serving the old woman kept silence, " that I have taken 
 an uncommon fancy to the exquisite arrangement of your 
 attire." 
 
 *' Ha !" exclaimed his auditor. 
 
 " Verily, 1 don't flatter," continued the graf ; " and 
 I purpose borrowing your dress, for a few hours, to save 
 you the necessity of surmounting the rugged distance to 
 the keep." 
 
 " I do not understand you," returned Judith, coldly. 
 
 '* Why, this is the case," said Maximilian ; — " I mean 
 to take your office, and so, in the most becoming guise 
 of coiffure, kirtle and opintschen, obtain admittance to

 the prison of Captain Hubert. This, dame, is my firm 
 determination, on the word of a prince." 
 
 " And what when you get there ?" inquired the house- 
 keeper. 
 
 *' That I '11 tell you another time," answered Maxi- 
 milian ; '' perhaps your master's liberation ; at all events, 
 I intend him no harm. Meanwhile, do you pouch these 
 hongres, as an earnest of thy guerdon." 
 
 *' Nay, I meant not to vend my courtesies ; — they are 
 no slaves," said the old woman, receiving in her lap, at 
 the same time, the golden shower, apparently in that 
 mingled spirit of prudery and gout, which, according to 
 all accounts, inspired Danae of old ; and the strangely 
 sorted pair, having agreed to concert their future pro- 
 ceedings on the morrow, the ancient dame hobbled ofF, 
 with her cake and korosian, about her business. 
 
 "May I never be blessed, if there be not something very 
 comical in all this," mused Pereny, when " left to his 
 own aversion."* *' An assignation on foot between this 
 mysterious matron of all work, and my immaculate 
 uncle ! A sister, she would give herself out, of that 
 poor devil of a sentry, whom Father Dominick, the 
 saints pardon me ! for so much as syllabling his name 
 
 ' . By the bones of all the saints ! I cannot say, I 
 
 admire being mixed up in these mysteries, and now, on 
 better consideration, 1 would not care, if I could slip out 
 of the concern. Well, I will first set free this Captain 
 Hubert, and, if such a dashing bit of service cannot, at 
 least, secure an avenue to the heart of his daughter, I'll 
 never more trust my skill, at that most intricate of all 
 manly arts — the art of making love." And away 
 Maximilian hied to his chamber, to con over all the soft 
 things he could think of, with which to ply his pretty 
 cloisteress, whose coming he momentarily looked for, to 
 administer to his hurts.

 We are now to recall to our reader's recollection, that, 
 some chapters gone by, Swartz, the keeper, made an 
 appointment with Count Ragotzy. The brigand was 
 punctual to the hour, and the two men met in the vestibule 
 of the castle, at the noon of night. Count Rodna, during 
 his occasional temporary tarriance in Hermanstadt, chose 
 his dormitory on the top of the north turret, — a circular 
 apartment, whose exterior masonry indicated, and circum- 
 scribed the extentofitsdimensions. Thewallsofthisnarrow 
 asylum, could hardly be said to be decorated, by the 
 tattered arras, which had been hung around, and which 
 disclosed, in many a gaping rent, the rough, and naked

 stone-work of the old fabrick. The apartment owed but 
 little to the hand of art, being wholly devoid of ornament, 
 since a pallet bed, a few chairs, and a small stone table, 
 made all the furniture. It bore, indeed, the gloomy ap- 
 pearance of a prison, rather than looked a place of ordi- 
 nary repose. Such as it was, however, the eccentric 
 viscount had claimed it for his " pensive citadel;"* and as 
 Swartz and Count Ragotzy, stooped to enter the low, and 
 narrow doorway, our hero (for as such the reader must 
 even accept him,) was seated on his couch, sustaining 
 before him a folio, which he was decyphering aloud, by 
 the light, that an iron lamp contrivedly threw, on the open 
 manuscript. The rest of the room was cast into compa- 
 rative gloom. Sigismund intermitted not his voice, till 
 the closing door awakened his attention, when he started 
 to his feet. " I should have thought," he began, " there 
 were many other wards and confines in this citadel, with- 
 out your being billeted upon me. We are high in the 
 air here, gentlemen, but 'tis one comfort still, we are 
 nigher Heaven than those anointed ones, who lie in the 
 chambers underneath me." 
 
 '* Ay," said Ragotzy, in a low voice, ** the nearer the 
 skies the nearer the lightning." 
 
 " Ha! what's that you mutter?" cried Sigismund. 
 " But the news at court, lords ? Doth credit grow cheap, 
 and traffic dear, yet?" 
 
 " The earth goes round as usual," said the keeper. 
 ** It were well, and I could almost wish," rejoined 
 Sigismund, '' in this -eternal revolution of crime and folly, 
 one had the art of giving time, a retrograde motion, 
 that deeds might be undone, and one, you wot of, go to 
 Heaven, — who now, — but the age of Joshua is past, and 
 he is your only hero, I take it, to cry ' stop' to a planet." 
 Sigismund paused, and then fixing his penetrating eye 
 upon Count R,eigotzy, he inquired, " What fellow's 
 this?" 
 
 * Wordsworth.

 " He, whom I wish you to conduct to Hubert's dun- 
 geon," replied the keeper. " Have you the ring?" 
 
 " Behold !" replied the young viscount, upholding the 
 required signet, " so let us proceed — I'll bring up the rear, 
 for if I must suffer an Egyptian within dagger's-length of 
 my person, why, I'd prefer having him under my nose, to 
 feeling him at my shoulders." 
 
 Count Ragotzy turned fiercely to the daring youth ; 
 " How, sir ?" he roared with a voice, whose vibration 
 seemed to shake the ancient tower to its base. 
 
 Sigismund leaped to the other end of the chamber: 
 " 'S blood ! thou choleric count," he said, " do you sup- 
 pose we are deaf, that you pitch your tones so high. Go 
 to — go to. — I spoke but according to my wits, and I 
 have been addle-pated, ever since a deed you may have 
 heard of." 
 
 " Silence, sir!" cried the keeper, fixing the young 
 nobleman with that stern aspect, which was wont to con- 
 trol his humour, even at the flood ; and the stolid visage 
 of Sigismund, immediately fell, and he merely rejoined, 
 ** Nay, I am easily persuaded." 
 
 " Seem not to mark his wanderings, good my lord," 
 said Swartz, in the ear of Count Ragotzy, " or they will 
 never end, and your chance of seeing Hubert to-night, 
 will be poor indeed." 
 
 The three were preparing, to leave the chamber, in the 
 prescribed order, when Ragotzy's eye happened to glance 
 over the title page of the folio, that Sigismund had been 
 studying, previous to their entrance. The book was the 
 Bible. The Cygani chief turned away, and his looks ex- 
 pressed some surprise. 
 
 '* You see, sir," cried Sigismund, " that were I not 
 distraught, I am anathema ; but only sane folks are pre- 
 sumed to exhale the infectious breath of heresy, over the 
 chastity of the Gospel ; and so I read my Bible, and say 
 my prayers, as God bade me, without standing in fear of

 pains and penalties. — Madman ! Now, to my thinking, 
 he that may sit in a cahTi valley, and yet chooses to repose 
 on the Carpathians, is your true madman. Now-a-days', 
 only fools retain their senses. But walk forwards, sir 
 Cygani. I attend you." 
 
 The three men quitting the round chamber, descended 
 the narrow spiral stairs, to the basement floor. Swartz 
 led the way, and the light of a torch, which he carried, 
 threw a fitful glare along the winding corridors, and down 
 the flights of steps, which successively, and for a consi- 
 derable time, without a word, they traversed; at length, 
 the party arrived at a small iron door, hidden from casual 
 observation, among the profuse ornaments of gothic archi- 
 tecture. Sigismund pressed a spring, and the door flew 
 open. Swartz stopped short. " Wherefore not go, by the 
 way of Father Dominick's apartments ?" he demanded, 
 " 'twere the shorter route." 
 
 *' Ay, and the more dangerous," returned the other ; 
 and the momentary gloom, that wrapt his features, 
 partially concealed the peculiar, and almost scornful 
 look, that accompanied the words. '' But why jar w^e 
 here?" he presently added, " either take the road, I'd 
 have ye, or return as you came: hand me the torch, and 
 be still." 
 
 Thus seasonably reminded of his infirmity, the two 
 followed the unhappy youth, without further objection. 
 
 Count Ragotzy could, with difficulty, conceal his 
 amazement, on finding Count Rodna as au fait as him- 
 self, at descending and ascending steps alternately, and 
 threading the labyrinth of vaults and chambers, through 
 which, often turning at short angles, they had to steer 
 their course. — ** Ibant sola sub nocte per umbram." 
 
 It would have been a startling study, could any one 
 have read the inward thoughts of those men, whom chance, 
 or fate, or mightier Providence, had thus thrown together, 
 and who now, in the depth, and darkness of night, in

 silence and solitude, pierce the entrails of the earth, and 
 rest opposite to each other, in an unwholesome vault of 
 irregular form, and dubious dimensions. But more dubi- 
 ous, and wilder than the dungeon's gloom, and, perchance, 
 as dark and inscrutable, were the recesses of Ragotzy's 
 bosom, and those of his companions. The caustic, and 
 mad Sigismund, — the saturnine, and wily Swartz,— the 
 impetuous, and vindictive Alaric Polgar. 
 
 What cement could unite characters, so discordant, 
 in mysterious combination ? It was the free-masonry of a 
 common peril — the overruling passion, signified by the 
 little cabalistic word — revenge! revenge! and on 
 whom? Wherefore? On Him! on Father Dominick — but 
 not on like grounds ; nor might the Cygani leader form 
 the remotest guess, how the interests of the monk ever 
 came to clash, with those of Swartz, and his lunatic 
 charge. But to our tale. 
 
 The party shortly stood before an ancient portal, orna- 
 mented with the usual rude adjuncts, and columnar carv- 
 ings, incident to the gothic style of architecture. Sigis- 
 mund, by the aid of a key, having thrown open the 
 valves, the three pressed into a small chamber, in one 
 corner of which was a niche, containing a statue of 
 the Virgin. A cross and altar stood in an opposite 
 recess ; between these, was extended, on the floor, a rough 
 mattress, the sole appearance of accommodation, the 
 apartment presented. Near the paillasse lay a discipline 
 or rod, formed of wire and cord, a sort of scourge, with 
 which, in the act of corporal mortification, Roman Ca- 
 tholics are accustomed to lash their persons. Fronting 
 them, as they entered, was a small door-way, curtained 
 by black serge. Sigismund, depositing the torch, by the 
 side of the altar, softly raised the curtain, and having 
 crept under, he was followed by his companions. They 
 found themselves in a small oratory, or subordinate 
 chapel of the cathedral church of St. Theresa. The few 
 votive luminaries that, here and there, reflected a gloomy

 religious light athwart the aisles, were hardly sufficient 
 to dissipate the shadows, that hung beneath the groined 
 arches of the roof. These connected the slender- 
 clustered columns from either side of the hallowed edifice, 
 and were carved in the richest tone of gothic architec- 
 ture. 
 
 *' By the holy rood above us!" said Sigismund, in a 
 low whisper, '' we must be wary." Favoured by an oaken 
 palisade, or screen, which partitioned off the chapel, our 
 three adventurers might observe what was going on, 
 without themselves being liable to discovery. Presently, 
 two persons walked with slow, and measured tread, from 
 the south transept, along the middle aisle. One was a 
 young chevalier, most elegantly habited, and the other 
 was immediately recognised for Scipio, the sable follower 
 of Father Dominick. These men seemed engaged in 
 earnest colloquy, but the drift of their discourse, owing 
 to the under-key, in which they spoke, might not be ga- 
 thered, excepting when, once, halting, near our wander- 
 ers for a moment, ere they turned, the following words 
 from the lips of the African, fell distinct on the ear: — 
 " Only do you obtain her heart," he said; " and, by all 
 that is consecrate to Heaven, beneath this holy fane, I 
 promise you her hand." Scipio soon after left the church, 
 through a small postern at the upper end of the aisle. 
 Ragotzy, from whatever ^'motive, perhaps by involuntary 
 impulse, made a motion, as if he would have rushed 
 through the church after him; but probably the recollec- 
 tion of the urgency of the business, he was upon, altered 
 his first intentions. Scipio's comrade remained, and 
 paced backwards and forwards, with folded arms, and 
 eyes, fixed upon the marble pavement, and the breathing 
 of a deep-drawn sigh, swelled, at intervals, along the 
 fretted vaultings of the roof, which echoed his agitated 
 footstep. 
 
 '' 'Tis Marc Antoine Ferraro, the secretary of the am- 
 bassador of Austria," observed Swartz, in a low tone ;

 *' what makes him hither? and what was't, in the name 
 of wonder, that that familiar of evil, was muttering to 
 him?" 
 
 " Are we to go forwards, — or to remain in this spot for 
 ever?" impatiently broke in the Cygani capitany;* "I 
 must see Hubert. Let's extinguish yon silken son of 
 dalliance, with a blow! — what does he there? For my 
 my part, ['11 wait no longer," and the bandit fiercely 
 drawing forth his dagger, was about to rush upon the 
 unconscious object of his wrath, when Sigismund held 
 him back. 
 
 '' Methinks, your valiancy is the madder of us twain," 
 he said, grasping his arm; '' and would carry the per- 
 mission, which fellows of thy stamp have, by insti- 
 tute and temper, to look frightful, rather too far If — Not 
 now ! not now !" 
 
 "Ha! wouldst cross my tiger spring?" hotly demand- 
 ed Ragotzy. 
 
 " Hush thee! my hero," cried Sigismund ; '^ speak low, 
 my king of gipsies." 
 
 "Let go my sword-arm !" exclaimed Ragotzy; "ten 
 thousand furies! — do you hear?" 
 
 "Ay, to be sure," returned Sigismund; "and so 
 would yon peripatetic, were he not deaf." 
 
 Swartz now hastened to interfere. " My lord," he said , 
 addressing the enraged brigand ; " be guided by me ; and, 
 would you speak with Hubert to-night, remain in silence 
 where you stand: — and you, Sigismund, loose your hold 
 on the count." Sigismund turned round to speak; but 
 after a moment's consideration, appeared to quail beneath 
 the fixed look, and energetic action of his keeper; while 
 Ragotzy, his arm being free, played convulsively with 
 
 • Capitany, — chieftain.

 the head of his dagger, at the same time darting', upon 
 the twain, a glance of fiery hatred. Like the fiend hunts- 
 man of Boccaccio, he glowed indignant — 
 
 " Frustrate of his will, 
 Not half sufficed, and gieedy yet to kill." 
 
 Sigismund encountered the sudden glare from that 
 dark-fringed lid, whose sinister meaning he was not slow 
 at^interpreting, with a steady aspect; whilst an equivocal 
 smile, that faintly struggled about the nether lip, tended 
 to redeem the severity of a contour, the most inexpressi- 
 bly dignified, and commanding, that nature ever wrought, 
 in her happiest mood. 
 
 Meanwhile, the object of all this commotion intermitted 
 not his pensive, and solitary walk. His deep and fre- 
 quent sighs, inhaled large draughts of the heavy air, to 
 cool the throbbing heart, surcharged with its unslaking 
 fires. Presently, he halted opposite a side altar, dedi- 
 cated to the Virgin. 
 
 " Maid and mother!" he exclaimed, in the audible tones 
 of a voice, of exquisite richness and compass ; ^' celestial or 
 terrene, or whatsoever thou art, or where, — whose blessed 
 name is based upon this shrine! Hear my votive prayer! 
 and if, indeed, the being of my mundane adoration" — 
 his invocation here came to an abrupt close, owing to a 
 female figure, enveloped, from head to foot, in a capacious 
 robe of crimson velvet, suddenly emerging out of the 
 dark, and advancing direct up to the spot, where the 
 young chevalier was stationed. 
 
 " Ferraro!" she murmured in the low, and plaintive 
 accents of aflTection. The other started, — he gazed va- 
 cantly upon the splendid form before him, but preserved 
 silence. " Methinks, thy looks afford but a cold wel- 
 come; nay, am I infectious, that you start as frighted, 
 when I cross you? What wert thou conjuring? I caught

 the thrilling pathos of that voice, but not the words. 
 What did'st thou muse on, was it love, or grief?" 
 
 ^' On both," said Ferraro, and he suspired with con- 
 vulsive force. '* Grief, the sedentary suicide," he added, 
 " is a miser, who loves to dig up, and count over the 
 items, that make up her sum of wretchedness, and gaze, 
 in secret, on her stores." 
 
 " Ay," replied the female, " grief may, but not love." 
 
 *' They are twins," said Ferraro. 
 
 *' Alas ! I have reason to know it," returned the fe- 
 male. 
 
 *' Twins, madam," repeated the chevalier ; " and 
 there's an avarice in Love, no less than in Grief." 
 
 " Surely I might share your hoard in either," said his 
 companion. " Nay, prithee, Antoine, be not so greedy 
 of your treasured woe, as not to admit me partner." 
 
 '^ I should know that voice," whispered Sigismund, to 
 Swartz. 
 
 " Hist !" returned his keeper. 
 
 " What dismal noise was that ? did you not hear a 
 stir?" inquired the female. 
 
 " 'Twas Death's, then," said Ferraro. " In such an 
 hour as this, they say, he broods upon the still vapours 
 of the night, or roams abroad upon his startling wing." 
 
 " Let us hence — I shake to hear you ; thy words are 
 strange; there is an unnatural sternness in thy manner; 
 I cannot see thy glance ! The rack of heaven flies past 
 the sickly moon ; — I cannot, I say, see thy glance, but 
 I can feel k. Let us hence, my love — thou art ill to- 
 night." 
 
 " Oh God !" exclaimed Ferraro. 
 
 *' Why wilt enrich the night-air with thy sighs ?" re- 
 joined the lady ; *' can I avail ? — tell me the cause of 
 woe ?" 
 
 '' Thou art the cause." 
 
 " I, Antoine ! — I ?" replied the lady, leaning, in the 
 very abasement of love, upon his shoulder. '* Nay nay,

 MANUSCRIPT XI. 27 
 
 thou speak'st at random. Let us leave this dreary edi- 
 fice, and hie us, where I may gather thee under my 
 wings, and suck thy secret from thee." Ferraro leant in 
 silence, against the iron screen of the holy shrine. 
 " Hark !" resumed the lady, after a pause, " how yon 
 desolate bird screams at the gushing wind." 
 
 " Desolate, call you him ?" said Ferraro ; *' now, I envy 
 him." 
 
 '' How so?" returned the other. 
 
 " He is alone, as I would be — Good night." 
 
 On saying these words, the chevalier tore himself from 
 the lady's clinging arms, and rushed out of the church. 
 For a moment, his fair companion remained as one pe- 
 trified, and then, with wild abandonment of mien, she 
 sprang after him, exclaiming, " Nay, another word, my 
 Antoine !" 
 
 The Cygani, and his companions, immediately emerged 
 from their lurking-place. — By a kind of silent compact, 
 no remark escaped from either, relative to the extraor- 
 dinary scene, which we have just detailed. Whatever 
 was the reason, though the effect appeared single and 
 simultaneous, they confined their sentiments, in regard 
 to it, to their own bosoms ; but, true mirrors to each 
 other's apprehension, either might behold, in the ex- 
 pression of his companion's countenance, the contagious 
 reflex of his own inward cogitation. The lady was one, 
 whom neither of them expected to encounter in that 
 place, and under such circumstances ; and their common 
 silence, was the evidence of a common sentiment, and 
 evinced any thing, rather than indifference. A cast of 
 reflection forthwith shadowed the physiognomy of these 
 midnight wanderers, — deepening the lines of Swartz's 
 sardonic visage, — tempering the fire of Ragotzy's dark 
 eye, — and sicklying o'er the hectic flush of Sigismund, with 
 an insidious hue of pallidness. Each looked as scared, 
 as he had seen Medusa's head ; but other business was 
 c 2

 now on hand, and the future had hours enough in store, 
 for reverie, and idle marvelling. 
 
 Sigismund, having retaken possession of the torch, 
 passed behind the altar, where Ferraro had begun his 
 orisons. Upon pressing a spring, a secret door, in the 
 side of the wall, revolved on its hinges. It opened on an 
 inclined plane, which our adventurers traversed for some 
 time. At length, on their leader turning an abrupt angle, 
 they stood opposite to several ascending stairs, hewn out 
 of the rock. Having surmounted these, Sigismund found 
 his further progress impeded, by a small wooden door, 
 constructed in the roof of the vault, which, upon his ap- 
 plying some means of forcible pressure, flew open. 
 Having passed through, he held the torch, whose 
 flickering light struggled, with the subterranean vapours, 
 over the narrow aperture, to illuminate his companions' 
 obscure ascension. They emerged, through a marble 
 slab, erected in the midst of a sepulchral ossuary, or 
 catacomb, containing numerous effigies and tombs ; 
 whilst, on every side, fantastic pyramids of human bones 
 were piled, and full-length skeletons rose, on the startled 
 sight. 
 
 They were standing in the same subterranean crypt, 
 whither the sentry had been allured, by the villie of the 
 precipice, as narrated in an early MS. There they 
 paused to take breath. Across this place, which showed, 
 in the dim light, like the infernal shades, forms, unde- 
 fined, and therefore horrible, blending, as it were, the 
 peculiar associations of divided worlds, were flitting in 
 multitudes. One tall skeleton rested behind the trio, as 
 if participating their mute, and common councils. Other 
 ossuous figures preserved their respective distances, as 
 the stern and unhallowed witnesses of what was enact- 
 ing. Ever and anon, as the flickering light would mo- 
 mentarily expire, shapes more shy, and swifter than the 
 evanescent sparkles of the torch, shot athwart the gloom

 of the populous sepulchre, whilst the relics of humanity 
 around, would appear to make dumb signs, and gestures, 
 in the " dim suffusion" of night. In those regions, seemed 
 to hover the unhappy ghosts, about their mortal remains, 
 holding mysterious, and supernatural intelligence, in 
 voices, which were no longer of the upper earth. 
 
 A commotion, as of another world, disturbed that 
 ghostly prison-house. The dead appeared to be stirred, 
 aroused, as it were, from their sleep of years or centuries, 
 and a breathless, heavy sense of injury, of outrage, of 
 the violation of the grave, seemed impressed on those 
 dreadful habitants. Perhaps, some dim, obscure whis- 
 perings, of the sort, crept, like a night-charm, from 
 beings they saw not, over the hearts of the intruders ; for 
 the inner spirit, still imprisoned in the clay, seemed to 
 shudder, at its mysterious intelligence. Count Ragotzy 
 suddenly made a motion to press forwards. " Let's quit 
 these gloomy precincts," said he, " they have turned all 
 air to earth in me." 
 
 '' Nathless," replied Sigismund, *' we may surely draw 
 the breath of life, for a few minutes, in these damp 
 cloisters, whose atmosphere must, one day, be common to 
 us all, till time shall be no more." 
 
 The voices sounded hoarsely, like a muffled bell, in the 
 substantial vapours of the vault, and the living utterance 
 was succeeded, by a deep, a long, and almost breathless 
 silence. On a sudden, there ensued a strange tempest, 
 and heaving of the air, visionary forms made their pre- 
 sence felt ; discourse, but incognizable to any sense of 
 humanity, was going on, and a chill sensation, instinct 
 with fear, clung, like an incubus, upon the hearts of our 
 three adventurers. 
 
 After listening profoundly, for a minute, they simul- 
 taneously started up, with the purpose of leaving the 
 sepulchre. Sigismund waved the torch on high, to 
 brighten its decaying powers, and its flash fell, upon

 the hideous objects around, which seemed to grow gigan- 
 tic, within the sphere of the fleeting radiance. 
 
 A low, indistinct hum, as of a decaying breeze, be- 
 came audible, in the direction of a magnificent cenotaph, 
 erected at the further end of the vault. It echoed, like 
 the unsubstantial and mysterious whisperings of the re- 
 proving shades; — again, they paused involuntarily, — 
 they recoiled. Can it be, that yon gaunt skeleton, is 
 now in the act of flitting across the stony pavement ? 
 No, surely, the eyes of Ragotzy must have deceived him ; 
 — and yet — again ! — 
 
 The light, which Count Rodna held, waxed dim and 
 dimmer. There certainly arose some indescribable move- 
 ment, in that shadowy solitude. The stirrings around 
 them ; those sounds, swelling and falling, like the 
 dirges of the wind, could be liable to no mistake, — they 
 can be no illusion of the nerves. What is it, now glided 
 about these revolting remnants of mortality ? Ha ! sud- 
 denly, and with violence, the torch, that Sigismund held, 
 was dashed upon the ground, and all things became 
 immersed in the wonted impenetrable darkness of the 
 sepulchre. It was the affair of an instant. Of the three, 
 only Ragotzy was armed. 
 
 ^' How, my lord, has this happened ?" asked Swartz, 
 in a faint voice, addressing Sigismund. 
 
 " Here, Swartz, where do you stand ?" replied the 
 other ; *' reach forth your hand : — that's well : and hark 
 ye, speak lov/, for, by the powers of darkness, the devil 
 is at my elbow!" 
 
 '' Nay, consider, my lord, this is no time — " 
 
 "No time!" interrupted Sigismund, whom the un- 
 quiet spirit of his malady seemed anew to visit, perhaps 
 because the darkness did not permit hira to see, that 
 there was, distinctly, a shade of displeasure, on the 
 brow of the keeper. " You err egregiously. Now what

 scattered, and merry men flown ? Talpra vitez ! * 
 Let's hold on our way: and, dojinons ! the day's our 
 own ! " 
 
 '' For Heaven's sake, my good lord," implored Swartz, 
 " be on your guard, or thou art lost." 
 
 *' Nay, I am not so mad," returned the youth, " but 
 I have wit enough, to keep my head on my shoulders." 
 
 "Sigismund, we are probably in the hands of ene- 
 mies," rejoined the keeper; *' and, however you may 
 reck nought for your life, remember, the destinies of 
 Hungaria are at stake." 
 
 *' The destijnies of Hungaria, Swartz ! Now that 
 passes ; — I, a crack-brained boy of twenty, and thou a 
 keeper, madder yet than oneself; — I would I'd light 
 enough to laugh, 'twere a rare jest ! the destinies of 
 Hungaria, forsooth ! the destinies of a fool's cap, you 
 mean !" 
 
 '' What am I to believe, my lord ?" said Swartz. 
 
 "Believe, man," replied Sigismund, with some aspe- 
 rity ^ "have I not told you? Believe! why that thou 
 art blinder than the mole!" — then, resuming his wonted 
 flippant tone, he added, " for he, ye ken, can see in 
 the dark, and work his way to heaven's blessed light,, .in 
 silence !'' 
 
 Sigismund spoke the last word with significant em- 
 phasis, grasping, at the same time, the arm of tlie 
 keeper impressively, with his hand. " But, hark ye, 
 Swartz !" he presently resumed : " that amiable young 
 Cygani, though somewhat fiery withal, who favoured 
 us with his protection so far ; peradventure, the con- 
 suming dart of death hath melted his body into mist ! 
 since he is no more palpable !" 
 
 " Count Ragotzy," whispered Swartz, " speak :" but 
 Ragotzy vouchsafed no response. Swartz hailed him 
 louder, still there was silence ; and whether the man, he

 called upon, yet tarried in the sepulchre, or had been 
 borne from thence, by some strange agency, remained a 
 doubt. 
 
 '* He must be dead," said Sigismund, with an in- 
 voluntary shudder, which was succeeded by a start, 
 when a voice from behind replied : 
 
 " No, he lives, but ye — !" 
 
 Both turned round ; and the hollow and sepulchral 
 voice, whose tones might well have issued, as they 
 seemed to do, from one of the spectral things, within 
 a few paces of where the wanderers stood, thus breathed 
 in their ears : — 
 
 '* Mortals!" it murmured, with horrible distinctness 
 of articulation, " what seek ye here ? Why, in the secret 
 hour, do ye, still encumbered with the slough of hu- 
 manity, molest the repose of the peaceful dead ? Why, 
 where the old king lies embalmed, and festering in his 
 cerements, dost thou intrude ? Thou!" and Sigismund 
 felt a thrilling pressure on his shoulder: ''outcast and 
 changling ! — thou of all men living !" 
 
 *' Ha ! what dost hint at ?" cried Sigismund : " Who 
 art thou ? Mysterious spirit ! I beseech thee, answer 
 me!" 
 
 " List not to that voice, my lord," expostulated Swartz ; 
 *' list not, for the sake of the cause to which you are con- 
 secrated, by every motive human and divine! List not, 
 lest—" 
 
 ''Swartz!" interrupted Sigismund, in a tone of im- 
 petuous passion, " hold off your hands, sir ; my fate calls 
 out; — I will be heard; 1 will be answered. Men have 
 gone mad in earnest, ere now, of less, than the bewil- 
 dered, desperate thoughts, which blaze within, and throe 
 my very vitals, — daily, nightly, hourly, I have gleaned 
 much — I apprehend more. I would be informed of 
 all — and will." He paused, but presently burst out, 
 with uncontrollable earnestness, and emotion : "By 
 the bones of my buried ancestry ! which the spirit, that

 swells, and soars within this breast, tells me, once min- 
 istered to the volition of mighty souls, whom yet I know 
 not, I adjure thee! solve the riddle of my fate, and 
 let the images of the past stretch their shadows, over 
 futurity !" 
 
 " Child of mystery /" replied the voice, " thou must 
 await, in patience, the unravelling of the intricate ways 
 of the lofty, and the proud; — when the confidence of 
 the wicked shall be violated, when his trust shall fail, 
 and he be confounded with shame ; when the prey of 
 the mighty one shall be retaken, and the spoil, seized 
 by the terrible, shall be rescued ; when the signet be 
 broken, and the scriptures published, along the cause- 
 ways of Transylvania, — then shall thy right and thy 
 might, meet in the tabernacle of thy father ! Mean- 
 time, as heretofore, the vials of thy fate are filed with 
 blood, and wrath, and subterfuge ! Yet say, would st 
 thou behold thy sire ? " 
 
 "My sire!" repeated Sigismund, "ay, though motes 
 of elemental fire blasted my eye-balls, at the vision, to 
 blind me for the measure of my life to come. My sire ! 
 He — who ? Show me ! " 
 
 " Give me thy hand, and the revealing tomb shall 
 answer thee ! " returned the solemn voice, whilst long, 
 bony fingers, dank and clammy, as those of death, 
 grasped the extended hand of Sigismund. Then a few 
 steps they measured, in the solid darkness of that 
 vault. 
 
 " My lord, thou art too rash," interposed Swartz, in 
 an eager tone of remonstrance : " Wouldst rip thy fa- 
 ther's marble, and call his reverend ghost, to affright 
 my dreams? The time is not yet ripe: — thou shalt not 
 go with her." 
 
 "Shalt not!" repeated Sigismund. 
 " I have your father's word for it," urged the keeper : 
 " my charge of thee, was the legacy he mingled with

 his dying prayers. She is thy bitterest foe— thy father's 
 foe, and his — " 
 
 '' Ha ! ha ! ha ! " interrupted the frightful voice. 
 
 " If thou respect thy future peace," cried Swartz, but 
 his appeal was drowned in horrid laughter. 
 
 The next minute all was still, and it was not without 
 something like alarm, that Swartz felt himself de- 
 serted,., the only living thing, in that dreadful se- 
 pulchre.

 We have now to revert to that fatal dawn, which intro- 
 duced Vicchy to our reader. 
 
 It will be remembered, with what anguish he left his 
 senseless child, in the arms of Judith, while, almost over- 
 come with the scorpion reflex of his contemplations, he 
 was guarded to the citadel. Having traversed a long, 
 dark passage, he descended a flight of steps, terminated, 
 by a massive postern, which, being with difiiculty un- 
 barred, disclosed to him his prison ; the lamp his con- 
 ductor held, threw forth just so much light across, as 
 served to exhibit the desolation of the place, — there was 
 a chill of damp and mould about the walls, which were 
 of great thickness. 
 
 " 'Tis many years since any soul has been here con- 
 fined," said the man, whose office several enormous keys, 
 hanging from his leathern jerkin, sufficiently denoted. 
 He spoke in a gruff, but not unpleasant tone. " That 
 door has not creaked on its hinges, since I have held 
 office ; I made a vow never to turn a key upon a pri- 
 soner in this cell; but conspirators are rife, in these latter

 days, and every other nook and cranny, being disposed 
 of, or bespoken, the Virgin must e'en wink at my 
 perjury." 
 
 To the astonishment of the warder, there was still no 
 response ; he lit the lamp, hanging from the centre of the 
 roof, but, again hesitating, he said, somewhat abruptly, 
 " I would not wish to alarm you, captain, but don't you 
 now scent an oddish sort of something in the atmosphere, 
 as if it were impregnated with brimstone, and sulphur, 
 and such like diabolical effluvia ?" 
 
 " The air is close, doubtless," replied Hubert, hardly 
 heeding him. 
 
 '' I dare say so," returned the warder, in a singular, 
 and mystic tone, " 'twere strange an' it be not." 
 
 Again, he appeared on the pointof withdrawing, when, 
 as if impelled, by some irresistible feeling, he turned back 
 from the door, and, coming close up to Vicchy, tapped 
 him on the shoulder, with a species of partisan, which he 
 carried about him, saying, at the same time, in a myste- 
 rious half whisper, *' Now, who do you imagine last te- 
 nanted this dungeon ?" 
 
 " Any person of consequence ?" returned Vicchy, 
 startled out of his abstraction, not less, by the pertinacity 
 of the man's address, than the peculiarity of his manner. 
 
 " No," answered the jailor; " but that poor haunted 
 body, (may the saints have his soul in their keeping at 
 this hour !) to whom — " and he placed his mouth close 
 to the ear of Vicchy, *' to whom the ^'^Z/^e-spectre 
 appeared, while keeping guard on the precipice." 
 
 " Indeed !" cried the other, whom the mention of that 
 " doomed spot," appeared to interest. 
 
 " 'Tis really the case," continued the keeper of the 
 prison ; " and that same night, he lodged here, as you 
 must have heard, he was whisked away by the devil, or 
 his minister upon earth. You know whom I mean, I'll 
 be bound, without my being more particular — ahem ;

 my charges ; you will not see any sight to care for, till 
 night-fall, those gentry seldom walk after matins, so 
 don't be frightened;" and, with this cheering recom- 
 mendation, his loquacious guardian left his prisoner. 
 
 Could any thing extraneous have roused the unhappy 
 man out of his despondency, the information just given 
 hitn by the warder, would have possessed that power : 
 naturally predisposed to a little superstition, he might 
 have looked forward to the coming night with no very 
 comfortable sensations ; but neither terror nor curiosity 
 availed, to distract the train of thoughts, that pressed on 
 him on every side, and those contemplations were "of 
 Cerberus and blackest midnight born." If undeserved 
 calamity be often difficult of endurance, how truly for- 
 lorn must be his reflections, in the utter wreck of whose 
 every earthly hope is a " self-incurred" affliction. * 
 Vicchy felt, he was only tasting of the bitter thorns of 
 that tree, himself had planted, and deemed, too late, he 
 " should have known what fruit would spring from such 
 a seed." The passion of remorse is, commonly, so tena- 
 cious of its object, that, if ever it be allowed a purchase 
 upon the human mind, it is no easy matter making it 
 loosen its hold. We may go on pleasantly enough, so 
 long as " we trust we have a good conscience ;" but the 
 man that doubts, in the least, may as well, at once, set 
 about a regimen of penance, or repentance, secundum 
 artem. 
 
 There prevails, among certain shallow people, a notion, 
 (the fallacy of which, by a strange oversight, on the part 
 of our spiritual teachers, has never been sufficiently ex- 
 posed), that sin, however it may turn out with the next 
 life, is sometimes permitted to evade its natural punish- 
 ment in this. Now such a narrow persuasion, really, 
 seems to us, to have been taken up, on most unsatisfac-

 tory evidence, our breasts, not being glassed to the in- 
 spection of one another. The world judges only (as it 
 can judge), by outward appearance, and determinate 
 success ; but a man's peace of mind, (for, be it remem- 
 bered, that the true constituents of happiness are a 
 matter of internal sensation,) is an affair, of which the 
 individual himself is invariably the best judge, though, 
 perhaps, not always the most faithful chronicler, and, as 
 the stoic * well observes, his happiness, or misery, de- 
 pends on the freedom, and use of his own will, and can 
 bear small relation to those terrestrial appurtenances those 
 " complemental and circumstantial pieces of felicity," as 
 Sir Thomas Browne f calls them, which are the mere 
 adjuncts and " external accidents," of our common 
 nature.

 as Lord Shaftesbury clearly demonstrates, " It is Virtue, 
 by which alone man can be happy, and without which 
 he must he miserable." \\ It is, however, certain, that 
 nothing sooner opens the mental eye to the enormity of 
 crime, than the reaping that direct retribution in the face 
 of the world, which, covertly or openly, ever follows in 
 the trail of guilt, and which Iwill inevitably, sooner or 
 later, overtake its quarry. Now Vicchy's soul felt, for 
 all the world, as if the Erinnys' whips and angers were

 being spent only on him. He found the issue of all his 
 fine schemes in imprisonment, and impending death, him- 
 self having to meet his fate on the scaffold, leaving his 
 fair daughter exposed, without a shield, to *' the slings 
 and arrows of outrageous fortune." When once this 
 latter apprehension stood, bare and hideous, before his 
 mental vision, it palsied the beatings of his heart; and, 
 as the minutest particles of morbifick matter, received 
 into the system, harbingers all the horrors of plague or 
 pestilence, so, the mere cursory thought of Veronica's 
 destitution, had no sooner glanced across his mind, than 
 it continued to ferment, till, by its fatal quality, it in- 
 duced a species of mental aberration, bordering on des- 
 pair. He threw himself wildly on his wretched mattrass, 
 and let hour after hour flit by him, without even a 
 change of position. When, on the following evening, 
 Veronica entered the wretched apartment, she found her 
 father stretched at his length, upon the ground. The 
 countenance, he exhibited, was pale and haggard ; his 
 eyes bloodshot, and his hair dishevelled. She sprung 
 forward to embrace him, but could extort no return to 
 her innocent endearments, save groans, and sighs, and 
 ejaculations, expressive of the extremity of his despair. 
 Veronica applied herself to assuage his sorrow, but it 
 was long ere she succeeded, in restoring him to com- 
 posure. 
 
 When, however, at length, Vicchy came to understand, 
 that the monotonous round of his prison-house was per- 
 mitted to be relieved, by the soothings of filial attention — 
 when he heard, from the lips of Veronica, the not un- 
 friendly message, which Martinuzzi had transmitted — 
 he started from the earth, with a wild and astonished air, 
 and, falling upon his daughter's neck, they mingled their 
 tears together. The voice of the maiden, and her intel- 
 ligence, combined to act upon his heart, like falling dew 
 upon a parched soil. " Son air doux est pour le coeur, ce

 que la rosee du soir est pour les terres seches et arides."* 
 His spirit appeared to rebound, and he bade her good 
 night, when the regulations of the prison compelled his 
 daughter's departure, in a frame of mind, much more 
 calm and resigned than, after having witnessed his de- 
 spair on her entrance, she could have hoped for. For 
 herself, she could only weep her adieus ; postponing, 
 until the morrow, the communication of a matter, which 
 alarmed her beyond measure. 
 
 It was only just before she repaired to the citadel, that, 
 on entering the room in which she was originally intro- 
 duced to the reader, the maiden's eye happened to glance 
 where a folded paper, in the form of a letter, lay near 
 the fire-place. Taking it up, she unconsciously caught 
 the superscription. She started — it was addressed to 
 the regent of Hungary. Supposing (which, indeed, was 
 the fact) that it must have been overlooked by her father, 
 in his agitation, while gathering up the several papers the 
 night before,Veronica, with the intention of again inclosing 
 the paper, in the common envelope, raised the window- 
 seat. This was accomplished, by the pressure of a 
 secret spring, a species of security, which was general 
 enough in those days, although the contrivance of every 
 particular mechanism might not be readily discovered. 
 What was the confusion and astonishment of Veronica, 
 on peering into the cavity of the window-seat, to find 
 that the packet, which had been there deposited, was 
 gone ! Whither had it vanished, and by whom was it 
 purloined? She explored every nook, a second, and a 
 third time, in vain. But, however inexplicable this 
 events, he had then no time to waste, in horror or amaze- 
 ment. 
 
 On her renewing her visit to Vicchy's prison, she per- 
 ceived, that the tone of her father's mind had, in a great 
 measure, recovered its elasticity ; and so she thought it

 right, no longer to delay acquainting him, with the occur- 
 rence, we have just related. Ere she had uttered three 
 words, forebodings of the truth rushed across Vicchy's 
 mind, and the traces of his emotion darkened his coun- 
 tenance. 
 
 '* So, girl," he exclaimed, when she had done, " the 
 prefigured object of my life, which I thought was about 
 to be embodied, and attained, has eluded my hopes. 
 Dost not grieve," he proceeded, in a tone, trembling with 
 emotion, '^ for thy folly, in not having read and sifted 
 the pith, and circumstance, of every tittle contained 
 within that packet ? Had you but done so I — the opportu- 
 nity was then ours ; we had the cards in our own hands, 
 and now, by heaven's queen, the idea is wildfire ! — (and 
 in his sudden rage, he violently struck his forehead.) 
 But you say," he added more calmly, " you have yet 
 one of these reprieves of destiny, mighty to save ; if so, 
 give it me. Where is it ?" 
 
 Veronica, dreading a renewed discussion upon a sub- 
 ject, the revival of which she felt anxious, if possible, 
 to avoid, did not immediately reply. 
 
 " Perverse and paltering girl ! do my bidding," re- 
 joined Vicchy, reddening with anger. 
 
 Veronica reached forth the fatal paper, which Vicchy, 
 having received, tore open, and bade her read the 
 contents aloud. 
 
 " I would to Heaven, my dearest father," answered 
 Veronica, " that it were in my power to obey you ; 
 but—" 
 
 Here Vicchy passionately broke in upon her speech, 
 and renewed his instances, to win his daughter to com- 
 pliance. 
 
 It were little better than a dry recapitulation of a for- 
 mer chapter, were we to transfer to our pages, the de- 
 mands and the evasions, which followed. It will be 
 sufficient to observe, that, after plying every weapon, that 
 the arsenal of threats and persuasions could furnish, the

 baffled parent was fain to give over the attack, on her 
 integrity ; for the like cause that, but for the lucky 
 accident of a flag of truce, must have shortly compelled 
 Lord Exmouth, to desist from the bombardment of Algiers, 
 namely, a want of ammunition. All Vicchy's pleading 
 recoiled, before the steady sense of Veronica, like a wave 
 from a rock; so that, at length, his oratory naturally 
 enough slackened fire, and his daughter shortly changed 
 the discourse, by mentioning the accident, which had 
 introduced Maximilian beneath their roof. 
 
 '^ What is this?" inquired Vicchy, starting up aghast. 
 " Who, say you, was wounded ?" 
 
 " One, apparently, too powerful to be offended," an- 
 swered Veronica. '' But first I ought to inform you, 
 that last evening the vizor'd foreigner, the same, who, 
 more than once, a year or two ago, visited you, has been 
 at our abode." 
 
 " Ha ! I might have foreseen it. Why have you kept 
 this back all the while ?" hastily and peremptorily ques- 
 tioned Vicchy. '' Well, and what did he say? By the 
 rood ! thou must have lost thy wits, simpleton — what art 
 silent for ?" 
 
 *' He required of me to give him the packet," said 
 Veronica. 
 
 '' And you told him," cried her father, ^' that — " 
 
 " I told him the truth, sir," said Veronica, calmly. 
 
 " And then" — interrupted Vicchy. 
 
 " Oh ! my dear father, he cursed me!" 
 
 '^ Cursed thee ! — Cursed my Veronica !" exclaimed 
 Vicchy, in smothered and bitter accents. "The villain !" 
 
 " And otherwise used such terms," continued the 
 maiden — "it makes me, even now, shake to recall 
 them." 
 
 " You did not, by any chance, let out, the packet had 
 been opened?" said Vicchy, eagerly. 
 
 " No, I simply gave him to understand, it was gone ; 
 and then, in a voice of deadly ire, he demanded a certain

 valuable box, which, he declared, he consigned to your 
 care, at the same time with the packet ; and on my 
 assuring him I knew nought of it, he stamped, and — 
 but I will not tell you ; only, there is something in that 
 man, from which my instinct revolts, as at a snake, at 
 once venomous and loathsome." 
 
 There ensued a long pause. 
 
 *' And what of him, the wounded man you spake 
 about ?" presently demanded Vicchy. 
 
 " He in the mask had not left many minutes," an- 
 swered Veronica; '' when voices, high in argument, fol- 
 lowed by the clashing of swords, arose from the street ; 
 the sounds of the affray, however, suddenly ceased. I 
 was still listening in terror, when the wounded chevalier 
 was borne, in the arms of his friends, beneath our roof." 
 
 " But you did not receive them?" demanded Vicchy, 
 turning round upon her with a countenance, which ex- 
 pressed a feeling of angry, and distressed surprise. 
 
 "What choice had I?" inquired Veronica, in turn. 
 " I saw he was bleeding, perchance, to death." 
 
 " 'Tis another link in the adamantine chain of destiny," 
 ejaculated Vicchy. " What on earth have we to do 
 to harbour strangers?" He said no more, but traversed 
 his dungeon floor for some time, with an impatient pace. 
 He had not yet composed his irritable mood, when his 
 eye lit upon several sentences, traced in chalk, on the 
 walls of the prison. Having unhooked the lamp, he 
 proceeded, to throw the light upon the writing>-^ — " What 
 have we here ?" said Vicchy ; " perhaps, if no nice moral 
 difficulty suggest itself to your delicate conscience," lie 
 proceeded, with sarcastic bitterness, " you will deign to 
 read these lines; however, I must beg, if you entertain 
 any scruple, that you will not at all strain a point, for the 
 sake of obliging a foolish imprisoned father." Veronica 
 could scarcely restrain her tears, but she made no reply. 
 " Well, how is it to be?" resumed Vicchy, sharply; ** is 
 it not your notion, that we are as free to read what's here

 written, as he, who may inhabit this wretched cell, when 
 I shall be a headless trunk. Trust me, he'll not wait to 
 refine upon the propriety, but will peruse it, if it suits 
 him; that is, if the misery of his lot be not too mighty, 
 to admit of momentary forgetfulness. Pshaw! pshaw ! — 
 dry your tears, and begin." The weeping girl did her 
 best to obey, and to the inexpressible astonishment of 
 both, at its contents, slowly deciphered, and repeated the 
 inscription, which ran as follows: — 
 
 " I write this, that my fate may be made known to my 
 friends. I was looked on by the evil eye, in my infancy, 
 and my subsequent life has been a long mistake.* At 
 nine years of age, piqued by my father's refusal to create 
 me a count, f at the same time with my brother, and al- 
 lured by some Wallachians in our neighbourhood, I was 
 induced to fly from Temeswar, of which city my sire was 
 prefect, with a tribe of that nation. With these free 
 bands I consorted for several years. It was T, who, 
 bribed by one, whose name I am yet ignorant of, at the 
 head of a small party, bore the Princess Beatrice, from 
 the escort of the graf, Pereny. The princess was pierced 
 by an arrow, during the melee, and I was told by the 
 man, who, I believe, himself did the deed (the same who 
 first hired my services, and who afterwards bound me 
 with an oath, never to return to Transylvania), that she 
 was mortally wounded. Years rolled on in exile, till 
 made aware, from experience, of the truth of our coun- 
 try's adaget, I resolved to return, and enlist in the new 
 levies of Martinuzzi. Would now to God, I had not done 
 so! — I was allured from my post, by the spectre of the 
 murdered Beatrice, who appeared to me, in the shape of 
 
 * Alluding to a common Hungarian superstition. 
 
 t The Prefect of Temeswar, as well as the Waivode of Transylvania, 
 and the Palatine of Hungary, possessed, at the era of our story, the pri- 
 vilege of ennobling their children.

 a villie, the princess's marriage having been unconsum- 
 mated at her death. She drew me to follow her to the 
 subterranean haunts of Hermanstadt: I there beheld the 
 man, who first tempted me to the abduction of the prin- 
 cess. Twice since, I have caught his bright eye fixed 
 upon me, — and I feel, yes I feel, I am in the boa's toils. 
 To-morrow, I have to appear before the lord cardinal; 
 but, however his eminence may determine respecting me, 
 I have a conviction, that my mortal career draws towards 
 its close. Ha! a step approaches, — 'tis yet the dead of 
 night. Kind prisoner, when you shall be liberated, seek 
 out Vicchy, Duke of Eissenburg, to apprise him of the 
 fate of his spell-bound brother." 
 
 " Albert of Eissenburg." 
 
 To attempt to describe the agitation of mind, with 
 which this announcement was received by Vicchy, would 
 be a vain endeavour. His brother, whom he yet remem- 
 bered, — a fair-haired boy of nine years of age (himself 
 being twelve months the senior), was here ascertained 
 to be that sentinel, over whose mysterious lot, he had so 
 often pondered. Albert, it appeared, had been the prime 
 agent in that crime, of which Vicchy was falsely accused, 
 and which was the first, and actuatingcause of his outlawry 
 and misfortunes. He suspected, in an instant, what indeed 
 was the truth, that the fatal mistake must have originated 
 in some strong family likeness; and he, at the same time, 
 recollected, and understood the drift of the inquiry, pre- 
 ferred by Pereny, in the chateau of Count Rodna, when 
 that graf asked him, whether he had not a brother? 
 
 While still in the full turmoil of consternation, which so 
 wonderful a discovery was calculated to excite, men's 
 steps were heard descending the flight of steps, leading to 
 his cell, and the flap of a little grating, in the centre of the 
 door being first opened, a moment after, the huge portal 
 was flung back, and a lofty plume stooped itself, that its 
 owner might cross the threshold. A masked figure, en-

 veloped in an ample mantle, was ushered into the 
 prison, by the jailor, who immediately retired. At the 
 first glance, which Hubert gave the stately form, his 
 brother's eventful life, and melancholy catastrophe, — the 
 princess's abduction, — his own outlawry, — all reminis- 
 cences, that, only the instant before, mingled, and rioted 
 in his brain, were wholly obscured, and overpowered. 
 He beheld, with his mind's eye, as he did with visible 
 organ, but one tremendous object. The man, or rather 
 fiend, whose feelings, he knew from experience, were in- 
 accessible to pity, — he could see nothing in all the 
 world, but this being come unto him for vengeance, — 
 vengeance for councils betrayed, and trust violated. 
 All power, and strength seemed to go out of his limbs, 
 and he felt, as if he could have sunk into the earth. 
 Veronica, on the stranger's being introduced into the 
 dungeon, prepared to take her departure. 
 
 " Adieu! father, for the next two hours," she said, and 
 waved her hand, but she did not observe the little regard 
 that Hubert paid to her words, or movement. Alas! guilt 
 will dry up the very sinews of courage, and the idea of hav- 
 ing to hold colloquy with the being, we have consciously 
 betrayed, face to face, when he fronts us, as an accuser, 
 must work in the brain, like cowardice. Circumstances, 
 and his own vacillancy, had turned Eissenburg into a 
 double traitor; first, to the state he professed to serve; 
 and next, to the Cygani tribes, whose sworn spy and fede- 
 rary he was pledged, at the same time, that he advised the 
 great Richter Iwan, of their secret councils. But it w^as 
 the remembrance of his having opened the mysterious 
 packet, which, at that minute, floated uppermost, and was 
 ?done objective in the rolling waters of the magnat's mind. 
 
 It was this thought, which, withering him all over, 
 as with a cold palsy, left him motionless, idealess, 
 almost breathless. He trembled before the chief of the 
 Cyganis, like one, touched by the wand of Prospero, —

 the very quivering statue of man ! Veronica stepped to 
 the door of the dungeon, with the intention of retiring, 
 when the masked foreigner, placing himself before her, 
 addressed her in as courteous accents, as gallantry ever 
 modulated, and which, to a degree, she could not ac- 
 count for, thrilled through all her frame. The tones of his 
 voice seemed to form the key to some horrible reminis- 
 cence, which had been once impressed in deep dyes on 
 her heart, though now nearly effaced. 
 
 " Verily, fair maiden," he said, " I cannot suffer your 
 departure. I find, to my surprise, I obtrude on hallowed 
 ground — the air, an angel perfumes, with the incense of 
 her breath, becomes sanctified, and her presence trans- 
 forms a prison into a temple." 
 
 Veronica was about to answer, when thus the stranger 
 proceeded. 
 
 " Nay, you shall not leave your father — he will, in- 
 deed, be to be envied, who is destined to receive, for life, 
 from thy sire's hands, so inestimable a gift, as that of thy 
 hand, fair lady ; but, till that severing of your kindred 
 loves, the tie, that binds ye is far too intimate, and too 
 sweet, to be rudely snapped, or disregarded. I would not, 
 for the world, for any trivial cause, or personal conveni- 
 ence, part such dear company. My business with your 
 father can be transacted an hour hence, quite the same 
 as now. Lady, I take my leave." Thus speaking, he 
 would have caught her hand, but she shrunk from his 
 touch, as from that of an aspic. She felt convinced, that 
 she must have both seen him, and heard him converse, 
 many years before, and that too, under peculiar and im- 
 pressive circumstances. An inexpressible loathing came 
 over her ; his horrible malisons of yesterday, were far from 
 being obliterated, from her memory, by the honeyed 
 phrases, with which, it suited his present purpose, to as- 
 tonish her ; but she felt, that in the maleficent being 
 before her, she beheld something, antipathous to her

 very soul. She merely replied, however, in as calm a 
 voice as she could assume, while, with increased rapidity 
 of pace, she neared the threshold. *' I was about to 
 withdraw, when you entered — excuse me, sir knight." 
 
 The foreigner profoundly bowed, and Veronica left 
 him, with her father, in the dungeon.

 Gentle reader, has it escaped your recollection, that 
 in the manuscript before the last, Ragotzy, Swartz, and 
 Sigismund, being assembled together, in the sepulchral 
 vaults, beneath the site of St. Theresa's church, — the 
 former personage evanished, in a very will-o'-the-wisp 
 sort of fashion, leaving his confederates to their '' own 
 aversion ?" Do you recollect ? — you do, — well then, 
 if you be not afraid, and have, otherwise, no particular 
 engagement, we would thank you to go back with us to 
 that aforesaid sepulchre : Nay, not in proprid persona, 
 but only mentally " Horatio," — only in imagination — so 
 come along, and hearken to a voice, that whispers a 
 single word, in the ear of Count Ragotzy. 
 
 " Whither ?" he demanded, in the same low key. 
 
 "To Unna!"

 The end of a scarf was immediately insinuated, into 
 the open hand of the chieftain, by which clue, he was 
 gently led to the base of the cenotaph of John of Zapola ; 
 hence, by the mechanism of a sinking floor, he descended 
 to the clay-cold cave beneath, where, alone, and in 
 darkness, he awaited the coming of his parent. More

 than half an hour, according to the impatient, and imper- 
 fect reckoning of the capitany, had tediously elapsed, 
 ere the reflection of a light, upon the earthy sides of the 
 chamber, and the echo of her imperious step, scorning 
 surprise, gave warning that this potent and superhuman 
 being, was at hand. After having set her lamp near the 
 sill, or entrance of the vault, she came forwards, and ad- 
 dressed the bandit capitany. 
 
 " Alaric," she said, " what art thou about in Herman- 
 stadt?" 
 
 " State affairs, good mother," was the cool response. 
 
 '^ Say rather thine own, rash and short-sighted mortal I" 
 returned Unna, — '^ thine. The interests of the Cyganis 
 abhor slaughter ; but nothing can appease thy insatiate 
 thirst for blood, which is as blind, as it is quenchless. 
 Last night, thou wouldst have made a rare, and royal 
 feast, but thy quarry was not forthcoming. To-night, 
 thou prowlest in company ; but, wet-lipped tiger ! thine 
 errand is still the same — blood ! blood ! blood !" 
 
 "Mother," observed Ragotzy, " this repetition of a worn- 
 out tale, defeats its own purpose : like the reverberated 
 echo of our voices, along these sinuous passages, — your 
 monitor falls fainter on the ear, at every repercussion. 
 I heed you not." 
 
 "Heed me not!" answered Unna! in a voice more 
 gloomy than before. " Thou thick-eyed beetle, whom 
 the heavens strike blind before they punish — not heed 
 me! — wilt thou heed Him? Alaric, the cry is out 
 against thee! — again, a price is upon thy blood. I would 
 have remonstrated, but I was cut short with a word. 
 The life of the Princess Beatrice, had been, a second 
 time, attempted by thee! What could I say after that? — 
 Nevertheless, I did speak for you — I urged — I threatened, 
 and my threats are fatal — they have proved so. Even 
 unto his victim, I have already half-divulged the truth : 
 Oh, God ! forgive my rage." 
 
 " What mean you?" said Ragotzy.

 " But, thine the fault, — on thy head be the punish- 
 ment," proceeded Unna, with increased vehemence. 
 '* Thy crimes, Alaric, admit of no alleviation, — at once, 
 devilish, and superfluous." 
 
 " That they are the former, may be like enough," re- 
 turned the bandit ; " but surely not superfluous." 
 
 " Now, hear me, my son," said Unna, more calmly. 
 " Last night, and again to-night, hast thou sought these 
 vaults, with the fixed resolve to commit assassination. 
 For the blood of the African, let Ferdinand answer it; 
 but, the Princess Beatrice, whose life was preserved, it 
 seems, by the forecast of father Dominick, — what em- 
 brion in thy brain seemed to require her death ?" 
 
 " Her blood was needed to glue me faster to the throne 
 I aimed at," answered Alaric, doggedly, '' I owe her no 
 ill-will, but I could not pause to pity her." 
 
 *'Thou pity!" exclaimed Unna; ''when didst thou 
 ever pity ? Yet, again I ask, how would her death ad- 
 vantage thee ?" 
 
 *' She knows the secret," answered Ragotzy ; *' and 
 might, in some compunctious moment of her madness, 
 blab her child's parentage, after I had married Czerina." 
 
 " Thou marry the Lady Czerina !" cried Unna, with 
 symptoms of astonishment, partaking of dismay. 
 
 *' To be sure I would, and will; what think you I 
 came hither for, else ? — why not, prithee ? — 1 m.ust be 
 king of Hungary, notwithstanding that, that Iwan, who 
 is my evil genius,vhath slain the Waivode, who with his 
 whole force was pledged to aid me. I would become a 
 throne as well as Czerina, I warrant me ; and my title, 
 at any rate, were as well founded." 
 
 " Thou marry the lady Czerina !" reiterated Unna. 
 *' Fool ! fool ! you know not what you babble of!" 
 
 " Ha! I tell you I do, and will act what T say," re- 
 plied the self-willed chieftain.

 arm's length from thee ; shake it off, as you would a 
 viper, from your bosom ; — this can never be !" 
 
 " Not be ! do you think so ? Then hear me^ mo- 
 ther," answered Ragotzy. He stopped, and only, after 
 a long pause, thus proceeded : " Last summer, when 
 Erdely was one wide theatre of rebellion, and the Bloody 
 Peter, and our Wallachian confederates, ravaged the 
 country, from north to south, I was apprized, that the 
 Archduke Ferdinand was on the eve of assembling a 
 large army, under the pretence of quelling the insubor- 
 dination, so prevalent in Transylvania, but really, with 
 the view of taking military possession of the province. 
 On hearing this, I debated with myself, what part it be- 
 hoved the Cygani people to play, in the impending 
 struggle. I had reason to fear, that, under the acknow- 
 ledged domination of any power, whether Austrian or 
 Ottoman, the reign of anarchy would insensibly subside, 
 in that death-sleep of the soul, which is brought 
 on by servitude ; and I inferred from the unresisted 
 authority of either, the gradual resurrection of order, 
 and the unshackled administration of martial law,., 
 a result, which the interests of our people too clearly 
 deprecated. I apprehended, that the charter of the 
 Bishop of Funfkirchen to Thomas Polgar, counter- 
 signed, for so many years, by the authorities, would never 
 be ratified, by the Austrian. I foresaw, we should be 
 withheld from injury, by the laws, and from public ra- 
 pine, by the arms of the conqueror. What was then to 
 be done ? The course of events hurried me on ; the 
 dread of foreign tyranny, heightened by present licence, 
 and impunity, was stimulated, by the ambition of fame, 
 and unshackled power. One act alone, I perceived, 
 might suspend our ruin, and, by that act, my mother, is 
 our ruin suspended. I resolved, by a master-stroke of 
 policy and daring, to enfranchise Transylvania, for ever, 
 from the regal pre-eminence of a single tyrant, or, at all

 events, for the present, to balance the respective claims 
 of Solyman, of Ferdinand, and of Czerina." 
 
 " I understand you not," said Unna. 
 
 *' Nay," rejoined Ragotzy ; '* hear patiently, what I 
 have to unfold, and then refuse to applaud me, if thou 
 canst. Disguising my person, I darted, swift and secret, 
 by a circuitous route, through the hostile country, and, 
 on an appointed day, hailed certain of my fellows, during 
 the celebration of high mass, in the abbey of Colosw^ar. 
 The Var* of that city is intrusted to the joint command 
 of two governors,! named invariably by the Diet, and 
 whose appointment is, consequently, independent of him, 
 you wot of — the guardian, I would say, of the queen of 
 Hungary. I was desirous to anticipate the projects of 
 the archduke, whilst Transylvania was still free ; so, be- 
 fore, as yet, the waves of Duna,| reflect the glittering 
 pride of the Austrian eagles, I watched my opportunity, 
 and already, ere the first lances of Ferdinand gleamed 
 along the defile of the White Mountains ; or, mingled 
 with the pinnacles of Alba Julia, were touched, by the 
 sun of Erdely, the deed is done, good mother. I got the 
 start of the invader, and forestalled the golden prize, he 
 aimed at. Every description of disguise had been pre- 
 pared. I made my appearance before the gates of the 
 castle, followed by my esquire, and twelve arquebusiers 
 on horseback. My safe-conduct, and letter from Mar- 
 linuzzi to the governor, recommending me to the hos- 
 pitable offices of his excellency, are presented. — You 
 apprehend it all, I see, good Unna ; — the pass, the 
 missive, the signature, the armorial ensigns attached — all 
 capital forgeries ; they would have staggered the lord 
 regent himself. 'Tis the old story ; the bait took, and 
 your son was admitted within the Castle of Coloswar,. .

 but alone. So jealous, in regard to strangers, were the 
 regulations of the Var, that my train was compelled to 
 remain, without the walls. This strictness, on the part 
 of the governor, was unlooked for, and I found myself 
 thrown upon the instant resources of my own mind. As 
 a friend of the regent, no suspicion could attach to my 
 purpose. Luckily, one of the governors. Count Raoul, 
 was absent upon duty. By Count Oldimar, his col- 
 league, I must admit, I was most nobly entertained. A 
 splendid banquet closed the evening. The wine circu- 
 lated, and I knew, it was a means, better than the rack, 
 to get at secrets. So watching, with joyous anticipa- 
 tion, the vintage dye purpling his lip, I plied the bottle, 
 till, as the carouse deepened, his heart grew, and reeled, 
 with the grape of Szegszdrd,* Then, Unna, I gave our 
 discourse the direction of my wishes ; and soon, with 
 much earnestness, sought to be permitted to look upon 
 the treasure of the castle. This, you will presently see, 
 was requiring, from my entertainer, an absolute breach

 of faith, and an infraction of the Orders of the Diet. At 
 first, he would willingly have turned the conversation ; 
 then, finding I persisted in my purpose, he thought to 
 silence me by a dignified refusal ; but, marry ! 1 would 
 take no rebuff, so that, ere long, his firmness gave way, 
 and, in the end, he was weak enough to yield to my 
 reiterated entreaties. 
 
 " It wanted an hour of midnight, and all the castle's 
 eyes were sunk in slumbers, when Count Oldimar con- 
 ducted me to the most retired, and inaccessible point 
 of the fortress of Coloswar. With stealthy pace, we 
 crept along, and he poured oil, from the silver lamp, into 
 the several hinges and wards, ere he soundlessly turned 
 the keys ; and now, having reached the goal, the noise- 
 less door gave way, on a slight pressure, and admitted 
 us. We stood beside the consecrated treasure ; then, 
 whilst the Castellan hung over the glittering charge, 
 committed to his custody, and was in the act of illus- 
 trating, to his perfidious guest, the several wonders of the 
 miraculous deposit, I drew my dirk, and — " Here 
 Ragotzy paused, and lowering his voice to one of horrid 
 stillness, presently added, '* 'Twas one blow ! only one, 
 mother ; and, methinks. Count Oldimar never broke 
 troth again !" 
 
 '' Son !" cried Unna, " 'twas a wicked deed. Ah ! 
 Alaric, remorse, on some after day, will wrap your fierce 
 heart around for this, and, like a ravening serpent, cor- 
 rode, where he makes his lair." 
 
 '* Oh ! I wot well all you would say as to that, good 
 mother," resumed Ragotzy, breaking in on the half 
 pause in Unna's speech ; *' but, prithee, hear me out. 
 To clothe myself in the garments of the governor, and 
 seize the guerdon of my daring, was my first care. I 
 then passed without the keep, and closed the door, upon 
 the bloody corpse of Oldimar. There, the Castellan yet 
 lies, clotted, and festering in his gore. I heard, since, 
 'twas given out, he had been transported away, by a

 demon in the form of man ; and, perhaps, as to that, the 
 good folks of Colosvvar were not so far out. That apart- 
 ment, however, has never, I believe, hitherto been sub- 
 jected to search. Under the circumstances, it was un- 
 likely, it would be suspected. I was careful to replace 
 the several keys in the spot, from whence, I observed the 
 governor, first, to take them down, and issued from the 
 castle, in the guise, and semblance of his excellency him- 
 self. I passed several sentinels, undetected, and un- 
 challenged ; joined my comrades, who were within hail ; 
 took horse, and bore away, in triumph, my inestimable 
 prize, to our cunicular fortress, in the neighbourhood of 
 Coloswar." 
 
 " And this prize was — ?" 
 
 "The regalia of Hu]sgary, mother!" replied the 
 bandit, with exultation: — "the sword of justice, the 
 sceptre of dominion, and that diadem, which, they tell 
 us, angelic creatures fabricated." 
 
 " The Regalia !" exclaimed Unna: " I ever understand 
 that the sacred ornaments were tabernacled at Vissegrade." 
 
 " So they were used, but after the death of John of 
 Zapola, the nobles of Hungary, for greater security, had 
 them removed thence, first to Buda, and then into 
 Erdely," returned Ragotzy. " Mark you the issue, good 
 mother?" he continued — " Why, in such superstitious 
 regard, do these weak nations hold this divine present, 
 that, in my proper person, as the son of the Gipsy 
 Polgar — nay, as the brigand capitany,* having that golden 
 type in pawn, — I would be sooner acknowledged their 
 king, by the people of Hungary and Transylvania, than 
 would the lineal monarch, uncrowned, and so unsancti- 
 fied by Heaven's benizons ! — And think you, mother," he 
 demanded, "I having preserved her imaginary inheritance, 
 and being empowered to gift, with so incalculable a

 refuse my hand ?" 
 
 " Better had she never seen the light, than wed thee, 
 Alaric!" exclaimed Unna, in a tone, which faltered, with 
 inward horror. 
 
 " Perhaps so," observed Alaric, '' but wed me she shall, 
 notwithstanding. 
 
 " Son, you know not what you say, — you know not 
 what you purpose," cried Unna. " Think not of such 
 visions, — let thy mind no longer hold dalliance with this 
 phantom thought, — this shadow of an impossible thing. 
 If thy crimes be legion, here were the master fiend." 
 
 " You mouth it finely," said Ragotzy, ''' though a 
 word in season would outvalue all these heroics ; — but 
 now, what matter presses, that thus you sound a parley, at 
 such an hour, and summon me from my friends ?" 
 
 " Ha ! there again," exclaimed Unna — " another vic- 
 tim, it seems, must be oiFered up to the demon of blood, 
 which hath possessed thee. What can Vicchy have done 
 to thee, that only his life might expiate the offence ?" 
 
 " The villain !" cried Ragotzy, " would you think it?

 confession of Alicia, which involves the fate, and the 
 fortunes of Hungary, lay buried, as in a tomb. I only 
 deal him God's justice. He hath eat of the tree of know- 
 ledge, and shall taste of death." 
 
 " Ha! what's that you utter?" cried Unna, in a sort 
 of a half scream, and turning upon Ragotzy, with a look, 
 which even made him start.

 The bandit was interrupted, by the shrill tones of Unna's 
 voice, exalted to their highest pitch. With foaming lip, 
 and sparkling eye, as with one hand she threw back her 
 dolmaiiy and raised the other, as if in the act of inspira- 
 tion, she shrieked out, "Ha! ha! it is working; the

 proud is going on. I knew, it would be so, — who can 
 controul the stars? One signet is broken, but not the 
 other, and the scriptures are yet unpublished, and so the 
 riddle of destiny is only half explained. Alaric, where is 
 that confession, which makes the teeming burden of the 
 packet of Alicia ? How came you by it ? Where is it 
 now ?" 
 
 Count Ragotzy regarded his mother with some surprise, 
 ere he vehemently replied — ''Flown, — disappeared, at least, 
 so that smooth daughter of the hypocrite would have me 
 believe ; but I will pierce into the heart of Hubert, and 
 force him to lay open, with my looks, the secret of their 
 bourne." 
 
 *' Ah! I knew," said Unna, "when I observed thee, 
 awhile ago, in the chapel overhead, and marked the smile 
 illumining thy dark brow, like the flashing lightning 
 the gloomy krapacks, and heard thee name thy resolution, 
 to see Hubert this night, that, in thy heart, thou medi- 
 tatedst his destruction. I could not mistake thy purpose, 
 and so I sent for thee hither, to set thee right. Let me 
 see. How stands the aspect of the house of Thomas 
 Polgar ?" She remained in a musing attitude, and fixed 
 her black roiling eyes, with all the ardent intensity of in- 
 spiration, upon the ground, as if the future were dimly 
 shadowed out to her mental vision. Thus, for a short 
 time, she stood, with compressed lips, inwardly muttering 
 some unholy orison, and when she spoke, it was in a low 
 indistinct voice, as if still wrestling with her thoughts — 
 " Broke," — she muttered — " by him ! by Eissenburg! — 
 he knows her parentage then, — but no more — nor 
 Alaric, — what need they ever should ? Fate has reversed 
 her disk : she, who sat in Heaven's sunshine, the delicate, 
 and the tender, is left in deep obscurity, — and her history 
 is, in turn, to be illustrated and hallowed, who has 
 hitherto been immersed in the shadows of adversity. So, 
 the one stake is up. And will then thy trust fail thee at 
 last, and thou be confounded with shame ? Aspiring

 soul !" she continued, in the tremulous accents of sorrow, 
 which contrasted strangely, with the loftiness of her lan- 
 guage, and supernatural pretensions — *' aspiring soul ! 
 hath thy prosperity reached its summit, — and dost thou 
 already await the revolution of the descending wheel ? 
 and have I lived, and loved, and laboured for this? 
 With these words, her head sunk on her breast, and she 
 hurriedly drew her shrivelled hand across her eyes, ere 
 she resumed, in the same subdued, and plaintive accents 
 as before. But the star of Alaric culminates in the hori- 
 zon, as heretofore, nor shall he anticipate the general 
 doom of his race, by giving the reins to his intemperate 
 passions. Then, how? Can the stars lie ? No, but they 
 show many turnings, and I will balance their decrees, 
 and hedge out of ruin. Veronica, of Eissenburg, must 
 become the Cygani Menyasgony."* She paused for an 
 instant; — again, by her fixed eye, her thoughts would 
 seem to run on into the future, and then, at last, address- 
 ing her son, who had looked on, the while, with a sort of 
 unfilial sneer of incredulity, — "You tell me," she ob- 
 served, *' that Hubert is possessed with the mystery 
 of the packet?" 
 
 " Doubtless," answered Ragotzy — ** If the documents 
 were taken from their envelope, he must know all." 
 
 " Then, he is aware, that Czerina " 
 
 " Of course," interrupted Ragotzy. 
 
 " But does he surmise, who is the only, and true 
 heritor?" interrogated Unna. 
 
 " What heritor? how — whom?" demanded the other 
 quickly, and with eager look, as if he expected to learn 
 something of deep interest; but if so, he deceived him- 
 self; for his haggard parent merely rejoined — *'True, 
 true ; as you say, how should he ?" 
 
 " Will she never have done playing prophet with me ?" 
 thought Ragotzy to himself, in the mutual, silence which 
 succeeded.

 '' Alaric," inquired Unna, at length, " did you ever hear 
 tell of an Hungarian baron, named Walstein ?" 
 
 *' Baron Walstein," answered Ragotzy, " assuredly ! 
 The first cousin of John of Zapola ; his daughter mar- 
 ried this Eissenburg." 
 
 "The same," said Unna. "Then the offspring of 
 the union of the Duke of Eissenburg and the Lady Ve- 
 ronica, in default of King John's issue, ought to sit upon 
 the throne of Hungary." 
 
 " Ha, surely ! beyond a doubt ;" answered Ragotzy. 
 
 i' Well, son, and who is she ?" demanded Unna. — 
 " Were it not," she continued, " more the part of a wise 
 man, think you, to wed with this lady, than to assassinate 
 her father ?" 
 
 Ragotzy started : the idea was as lightning. 
 
 " Consider," proceeded the Boszorkani, " the same 
 moment, that Eissenburg became instructed in the rotten 
 tenure of Czerina's inheritance, he learned his daughter's 
 rights." 
 
 The brigand, looked as if his whole tide of thought had 
 undergone a revulsion. " Ha, ha !" he cried, " the light 
 breaks in upon me. Mother, thou art my better angel. 
 I know not why it is," he presently added, " but it is 
 abhorrent to flesh and blood to slaughter a man — I mean 
 for no object ; so let Vicchy live, and he shall give me 
 his daughter ; at whose blest thought, the spirit of joy 
 moves upon my blood. I will first endow her with the 
 regalia of St. Stephen, and then marry her kingdom 
 outright. Hey, my oracular mother ! is that one of the 
 decrees of fate ?" 
 
 A deep, clear accent replied, as if from the bottom of 
 the earth, so like it sounded 
 
 " unto a tone, 
 Such as sick fancies, in a new-made grave, 
 Might hear — " * 
 
 " She shall be queen!"

 ''Those words — were they yours, my son?" asked 
 Unna. 
 
 *' Did you speak, mother ?" inquired Count Ragotzy. 
 
 Both, casting their startled eyes around, made answer 
 in the negative. 
 
 The echoes of the vault could hardly have returned 
 the words of Ragotzy, so distinct and emphatic was the 
 intonation. 
 
 " We had better part now," said Unna presently, in a 
 half whisper. *' Here, take this signet-ring of Marti- 
 nuzzi, and to-morrow, by its means, you can gain access 
 to Vicchy." 
 
 " This ring? how came you by it ?" asked Ragotzy. 
 
 " No matter," answered his mother. Let us hie to the 
 church of St. Theresa, and there separate." 
 
 " What have become of Swartz, and that wretched 
 madman, Rodna ?" 
 
 •' That wretched madman, as you style him, I have 
 secured, for you to bear away, into safe custody. The 
 keeper, I will see to myself, for old acquaintance sake. 
 But mark, the nodding stylactites drip against our lamp; 
 unless we remove hence, we shall be left in dark- 
 ness." 
 
 The Cygani leader, and his parent were preparing to 
 quit the gloomy precincts, where they held their confer- 
 ence, when they were made sensible of the existence of 
 a kind of shadowy outline of a human form, melting 
 into the depths of the vault. With a horrible ejacula- 
 tion, Ragotzy made a rush at the receding figure, and, 
 gaining upon it, would have struck the object of his pur- 
 suit, to the earth. 
 
 *' An you push forwards at that rate, in the dark, for any 
 time, you may chance to knock your head against a 
 stone, my Egyptian !" exclaimed a voice, which Ragotzy 
 immediately recognized, for that of Count Rodna. 
 
 " How ! have you got loose, my heretic hero ?" de-

 manded the Cygani ; " I understood, you were left all 
 alone, to your own, and the dungeon's vapours." 
 
 " It were a sin to submit to such confinement," replied 
 Sigismund; " so my folly sought to escape, and here 1 
 am." 
 
 '^ Is your folly wont to be your guide and prompter, to 
 such purpose ?" inquired Ragotzy. 
 
 " Not always," returned Sigismund ; folly, however, is a 
 good friend; or, if otherwise, 'tis the best, that most of us 
 have to trust to, on this side the grave. Had Count Oldi- 
 mar been less eloquent, his tongue had wagged still ; had 
 my grandsire been as I am, he'd not perished. I covet 
 no more wit, than as much, as will keep life and soul 
 together. Egad, man ! I would but live. But here's 
 your mother, and her folly is the greatest, I ever heard of, 
 or she would never have made it my duty to destroy, 
 root and branch, the name of Polgar, from out of the 
 land." 
 
 Ragotzy's brow darkened, as if charged with thunder, 
 and his eye seemed to launch the lightning, as he began — 
 '* Ten thousand devils ! how do you dare — " 
 
 *' Son," interrupted Unna, in a whisper, " 'tis vain 
 contending with his maniac humour; let us lead him to 
 Swartz, who will prepare him, for his abduction to the 
 Samos." 
 
 ^' Nay, I will have no hand in this business," exclaimed 
 Ragotzy ; *' why should I play jailor to a mad bully, like 
 that ? Let Swartz keep his bail." 
 
 " Alaric," said Unna, tightening her fingers forcibly 
 round the arm of her son, and speaking, in a solemn and 
 earnest whisper — '* Alaric, that bail is of more worth 
 than you imagine. Take the advice of one, who knows 
 how to avert, not merely the influence of the stars, but 
 human combinations, which are often more withering, and 
 more fatal. Lay hold of this opportunity: keep watch 
 and ward over that youth, and never — never let him 
 elude your vigilance."

 The voice, in which this was delivered was so impres- 
 sive, that even the impatient temper of llagotzy was 
 awed to obedience. He silently intimated 'his assent, 
 and shortly afterwards, the three emerged behind the

 This history may not unaptly be compared to that oblong 
 convenience of modern days, yclept an omnibus ; for it 
 conveys odd characters short distances, without asking- 
 unnecessary questions : and as its archetype, stage after 
 stage, so doth our narrative, chapter after chapter, find 
 itself occupied, with different people. There occurs, 
 however, this remarkable difference ; that whereas the 
 successive passengers of the omnibus have commonly no 
 sort of affinity, or connection with one another — our seve- 
 ral chapter loads are, voluntarily or involuntarily, more 
 or less interested, in the dim and shadowy mainspring of 
 these mysteries ; and one and all are so many puppets, 
 taken up and set down, by Monsieur le Conducteur, after 
 a scheme of his own, not very consistent with their 
 *' delusive sense" of liberty.

 At some such conclusion the gentle critic will arrive, if 
 he only patiently bear with our jolting for awhile, and 
 considerately make allowance, for any unpleasingness or 
 natural defects, incident to so novel a mode of convey- 
 ance. All experiment is fallible ; and the literary curri- 
 culum, for which we would fain obtain toleration, and 
 a licence, is truly a tentative set-out, and constructed, as 
 we are well aware, of very slight materials — 
 
 " A quab, 'tis nothing else, a very quab." * 
 
 Let us now, however, " pick up" two of the charac- 
 ters of our dramatic narrative ; whom we left, not by 
 the way side, but under lock and key. 
 
 Veronica had no sooner retired, from her father's 
 dungeon, than the masked visitor, while raising his avan- 
 taile to its full extent, observed; " I find this visor in- 
 valuable, during my venturesome trips to Hermanstadt ; 
 but any mask is superfluous, between you and me ; — 
 we know each other." 
 
 Vicchy was never more thoroughly at a loss, in his 
 life. The human tones of Ragotzy's voice, so different 
 from the intonation, he had cause to apprehend, dwelt 
 on his ear, like a reprieve, or rather absolution. He 
 had expected, that the Cygani, (whose executions, when 
 his savage nature was roused, usually followed liis sen- 
 tences, as closely as the clap, the lightning), after 
 sternly, and passionately, pointing out the nature of 
 his offence, would have pronounced his doom, and 
 have inflicted it, with his own hand, upon the spot. In- 
 stead whereof, Vicchy hardly recollected to have, ever 
 before, heard Ragotzy, deliver himself so blithely and 
 cordially ; so much so, that the federary ventured to 
 raise his eyes, and look his captain in the face. He 
 read nothing there, that contradicted the assurance of 
 the Cygani's speech ; his full dark eyes laughed out 
 with positive hilarity. Vicchy, immediately, felt greater 
 
 ♦ Ford.

 confidence, in the reality of appearances ; for he knew, 
 that, while it lasted, the feeling of cheerfulness described, 
 as it were, a magic circle, round about the human heart, 
 which nought, that was false or cruel, could overpass. 
 If the dank soil of hypochondriasis, wherein bad passions 
 germinate, be found unfavourable to that oro/xa cUaiov, 
 which Plutarch esteemed essential to piety — that liberal 
 air, which Pythagoras affirmed to be becoming, in the 
 worship of the Deity, on the other hand, the rationally 
 cheerful man, bears a charmed temperament, which is, 
 or ought to be, not only the teeming parent of every 
 virtue, but, as a celebrated writer expresseth it, '* the 
 best foundation for piety, and true religion." * 
 
 Is it not joy, which constitutes the respirable fluid of 
 the cherubim and seraphim, at once, the prerogative, and 
 the necessity of their being ? The translucent ether of 
 perfect happiness, which, in no fancied, or unauthorised 
 belief, we deem the fons et principium of heaven, would 
 alone, in that pure abode, suffice to extinguish the foul, 
 and alien principle of sin. It is not possible, that im- 
 penitence and guilt, can respire the defecated element 
 of bliss, which is the portion of supernals. Even while 
 reeling, amidst the fumes of this low earth, and inhaling 
 the inebriating vapours, ordinary to mortality ; the man, 
 conscious of his iniquity, can have no title to that tran- 
 quillity of mind, which is the natural effect of innocence, 
 nor can he, at best, without difficulty, counterfeit a 
 transient satisfaction. 
 
 Thus Hubert, instantaneously, argued ; and he re- 
 membered, moreover, that Count Ragotzy was not in 
 the habit, either of disguising his sentiments, or of 
 reining in his passions. From his free aspect, therefore, 
 Vicchy drew a favourable omen ; and, whatever lurked 
 behind, he was satisfied, it was not the overwhelming 
 indignation, beneath which, in idea, he at first cowed,

 and which, he knew, must sweep before it, like straws 
 in the whirlwind, every species of explanation, or re- 
 sistance. 
 
 The explosion, which he had had reason to appre- 
 hend, he meant to have shunned, and set at defiance, 
 by striking his tent, and, afterwards, keeping close, 
 within the camp of the Richter Iwan. 
 
 " Methinks, these are sorry quarters, De Eissenburg, 
 for an approved soldier, and a true magyar, like thy- 
 self;" continued Ragotzy, giving, at the same time, a 
 careless'look round, on the dingy walls of the dungeon. 
 
 In these few words, besides the blandness of tone, 
 with which they were spoken, and the unwonted feeling 
 of courtesy, their sense might seem to manifest, two 
 points struck the hearer, as remarkable: — first the in- 
 cidental mention of his military profession, and of the 
 country of his birth, both allusions being, in Hubert's 
 apprehension, designedly introduced; and, secondly, 
 the circumstance of his addressing him by his title : — 
 an accident, which had not before happened, since 
 that nobleman, became the thrall of the Cygani leader. 
 Vicchy's observation of these particulars, descended 
 upon his sunken heart, like a gentle shower upon the 
 arid meadows, after a long drought, in summer. His 
 hopes, and wishes, intents, — righteous or desperate, de- 
 fined or undefined, — all seemed to spring forth, with 
 something of their first freshness ; — brightly, and greenly 
 as heretofore. 
 
 *' Indeed, Lord Ragotzy," he replied, '* this prison is 
 no very desirable domicile for any man." 
 
 "And, if I err not, thou shalt not be immured here, 
 for long," quickly returned the Cygani. 
 
 Considering there were two short, and opposite paths, 
 diverging from that dungeon, — the one conducting to 
 freedom, the other to the scaffold, this ambilogy did not 
 sound quite satisfactory, to the party interested ; but, 
 in like manner, as we are told, by Sterne, that a French-

 man will, invariably, take a dubious compliment, in 
 the manner in which it seems to be meant ; so is it 
 the characteristic of misfortune, never to discern any 
 ambiguity, in the language of consolation, or of sym- 
 pathy. 
 
 In answer, to the critical speech of Ragotzy, Vicchy 
 replied, " I hope so, for I much weary of the monotony 
 of this confinement." 
 
 "Especially, Eissenburg, since thou hast caught a 
 glimpse of the near fulfilment of the prophecy of Unna," 
 rejoined Ragotzy ; and a shrewd expression twinkled in 
 his eyes, past his hearer's decyphering : *' You would be 
 up, and doing," he presently added : "I understand 
 you, man." 
 
 "And, if so," thought Vicchy to himself, "'tis more 
 than I can predicate of you." 
 
 However, the memory of the prediction of the Boszor 
 kany, was ever floating on the mind of the wretched 
 magnat ; and the whole future, seemed concentrated in 
 the fulfilment of that prophecy. Every thing connected 
 with it, possessed, for Vicchy 's breast, an absorbing in- 
 terest. The golden glory, that was fated, one day, to en- 
 circle the brow of Veronica, constantly seemed to shimmer 
 before her father's eyes : and, although nought remained 
 in his possession, of the fatal packet, excepting a single 
 paper, (which might, however, unfold the high vocation of 
 his race, as the last sibylline leaf foreshewed the destinies 
 of Rome), he clung to the fond belief, that those writings, 
 (into whatsoever hands they had fallen), would yet work 
 out, and minister to the greatness of his daughter ; through 
 whose agency, he was destined to recover his forfeited 
 rights, and hereditaments. But, although this was a 
 splendid vision, which he never lost sight of, Hubert 
 hardly comprehended, how the gipsy leader came to 
 allude to it. 
 
 " If Ragotzy," he argued, " be conscious, that the 
 specific sense of Unna's prophetic promise, might be

 MANUSCRIPT XIV. 69 
 
 gathered, from the perusal of the packet, there must be 
 some arritre pensee, to make the chief submit, with 
 equanimity, to my having examined the deposit, he con- 
 fided to my hands, and honour: and some spell, doubt- 
 less, hinges on my supposed knowledge of this secret, 
 which disarms his resentment. 
 
 " What of the prophecy of Unna?" hesitatingly in- 
 quired the trembling father, raising his eyes to those of 
 Ragotzy, with an inquisitive and wistful look. 
 
 ''Why, man, thou canst not have overlooked thy 
 daughter's claims on Hungary, (Hubert started) after 
 having possessed thee of the contents of the packet." 
 
 Hubert made a determined motion of dissent. 
 
 " Bah ! Eissenburg, have done with this. Your 
 daughter would fain have persuaded me, the deposit was 
 stolen : — I am not to be so gulled. You have opened 
 the packet ; 'tis useless to deny it ; and now, knowing 
 that that bright flower, the Lady Veronica, is destined 
 to shine, like a radiant star, in the firmament of empire, 
 you are disposed to retain the evidence. Nay," he con- 
 tinued, as if desirous still further to assure the wavering- 
 
 o 
 
 confidence, of his companion; "do not fancy, I make 
 a charge upon thee for this ; by God ! I cannot blame 
 you, for having an eye to your daugliter's interests." 
 
 Some moments elapsed, before Vicchy mustered self- 
 composure, Sufficient to reply. 
 
 " I have no evidence to retain : — what you speak of, 
 I may guess at, but know not. Veronica told you 
 truth — the packet is stolen." 
 
 Thus Hubert spake, with earnest, and rapid articulation, 
 whilst his heart throbbed impetuously, at the idea of his 
 having actually been placed within the compass of all 
 his most sanguine, though vague, anticipations, to no 
 purpose. It was but the venture of a die between beg- 
 gary and some mighty, unknown greatness; yet, owing to 
 that evil, which ran like a latent thread, through the 
 warp and woof of his intricate career, the possibility of

 redeeming the past reverses of his life, by one counter- 
 cast of fortune, was taken away, by the same active, and 
 invisible agency, as had offered it, to his acceptance. It 
 was as if the juggling powers were sporting with his 
 feelings, and had only proffered him their smiles, to 
 weave more completely their mesh around him. Know- 
 ing, that Fortune was a coquet, he had positively forced 
 her very spindle, out of the lagging hands of the hesitat- 
 ing maid. So far as depended on his acumen and energy 
 of will, he would, at whatever risk, have fulfilled his des- 
 tiny. Had he not kept back the packet, — had he not, 
 with nothing on earth to warrant him, to save him harm- 
 less, confidently burst open the envelope? Would he not 
 have mastered its secret ? And now it turned out, he was 
 right. 
 
 Had Veronica heeded his entreaties, all had gone well; 
 but he only discovered, past a doubt, that the forecastings 
 of his soul, were true prompters, when the writings were 
 beyond his controul, and the packet pilfered. The idea 
 was, as the pressed rowel of a spur, in the side of a fiery 
 courser. 
 
 " Veronica told you truth," he presently repeated, 
 with increased vehemence. — " The packet is stolen!" 
 Ragotzy looked at him steadily for an instant, before he 
 again spoke : — *' Stolen," he repeated; " yet, no, it can- 
 not be, — it is impossible." 
 
 " 'Tis true," said Hubert, doggedly. 
 
 Count Ragotzy had entered that cell, firmly persuaded, 
 that the account, given of the loss of the packet, by Ve- 
 ronica, was a subterfuge, to cover her sire's dereliction of 
 honour. It was not readily, his mind admitted a differ- 
 ent conclusion ; but it never occurred to him, that even if 
 Vicchy's asseveration were to be believed, the mysteries 
 of the packet might have been invaded previously to the 
 purloining of the papers, and in how far this was the 
 state of the case, Vicchy gave him no information. *'So," 
 thought the brigand, ** 'tis no use apprizing Eissenburg of

 his daughter's rights. Whoever holds these documents, 
 I have no doubt, the lady Czerina will soon be made 
 sensible, that the mysteries are no longer sealed, and 
 Eissenburg's daughter is next heir; meanwhile, my pro- 
 posal will appear more astounding." 
 
 '* Well, Eissenburg," he said aloud, after a moment's 
 cogitation; *' since the packet's gone, there is no help for 
 it ; you will be more careful another time, I warrant; at 
 
 least, you would be, if , but no matter; let it not 
 
 disturb you." Vicchy preserved a gloomy silence. — 
 " Eissenburg," presently resumed the brigand, " your 
 fair daughter affirmed to me, that you left her in igno- 
 rance of there being any other, and perchance a more 
 important trust, confided to your honour, — that of the 
 BOX, I mean. I hope to God you have it secure." Vicchy 
 explained, where he had deposited the charge in question, 
 
 " Ha !" answered Ragotzy, " 'tis a chance coincidence, 
 which, if my mother knew, she would harp on, by the 
 hour. In Hungarian earth, — under thy roof; well, I 
 must needs own, the chapter of accidents sometimes 
 turns up odd occurrents, and this reminds me, for what I 
 have waited on you." He paused for more than a 
 minute, ere he added; — ''do you know, my good lord, 
 I would stand indebted to your kind offices, for a great 
 happiness?" 
 
 " To mine," Lord Ragotzy?" 
 
 *' To your friendship, Eissenburg. You are acquainted 
 with my rank." 
 
 " Your rank!" thought Vicchy. 
 
 " My possessions." 
 
 " And how acquired!" said Vicchy, internally. 
 
 " You know me for the leader of five hundred tents of 
 the Cygani? Thousands of picked men wait upon my 
 word, and would march at my command, though it were 
 to inevitable death." 
 
 " To what tragedy can this be the prelude?" pondered 
 Hubert.

 *' But one other, in all Hungary, or Wallachia; ay, or 
 I might add, of Erdely, possesses, in fact, such sub- 
 stantial power as myself; you know whom I mean, — the 
 Richter I wan, and with him, our people will shortly form 
 an alliance, as, heretofore, they may have leagued, with 
 the Moldavian Peter." 
 
 " The Richter I wan is too well instructed in your pro- 
 ceedings^ to trust you," was the internal comment of 
 Vicchy. 
 
 " Now," continued Ragotzy, " two such redoubtable 
 leaders might, with ease, settle the succession of this 
 kingdom, at their own will; but let that pass, — enough, 
 you know my might." 
 
 " Here's a flourish of trumpets ! to what, in the name of 
 wonder, is it the induction ?" marvelled Vicchy. There 
 was a momentary pause, which Ragotzy again broke. 
 
 " Eissenburg," he exclaimed abruptly, " you have a 
 lovely daughter !'^ 
 
 " I have a daughter," said Vicchy; and his cold for- 
 bidding eye rested on that of the brigand, for an instant; 
 '* but excuse me, — her name must not mingle with aught 
 between thee and me." 
 
 '' Nay, 'tis of her I came to speak," remarked Ragotzy. 
 
 '' Of her?" repeated Vicchy. Thou !" he stepped 
 aside from the brigand, and became evidently moved. 
 *' My Lord Ragotzy," he presently added ; " choose 
 some other topic to descant on ; there's a religion of the 
 hearth, that 'tis not allowed, nay, which 'tis a sort of 
 blasphemy to prophane, by irreverend allusions. AVith 
 me, my lord, my child's a sacred point, — pray change 
 the subject." 
 
 "Thou art dull, or wilt not guess my meaning," said 
 the Cygani leader; "thy daughter is an angel!" The 
 foot of Vicchy stamped slightly: both his hands were 
 clenched; but his face was turned away. " In short, not 
 to hold you in suspense," proceeded Ragotzy, '* I would 
 make her mistress over five hundred tents, and, by your

 leave, gift her with the allegiance of twice as many thou- 
 sand vassals." There is only one word, equivalent to 
 picture Hubert's state of mind, on hearing this sudden 
 declaration, from the lips of Count Ragotzy, and that 
 
 word is, HORROR. 
 
 We have elsewhere expatiated, on that pure, and un- 
 alloyed parental love, which made the last redeeming 
 feature, in a character, otherwise polluted, with more than 
 an average share of the weakness and wickedness, that 
 Adam and Eve, between them, contrived to bequeath, to 
 their posterity, as a sort of moral heir-loom, inseparable, 
 from the mould of clay, in which they incarnated, and 
 handed down, the immortal soul, and their own likenesses. 
 It is our belief, that no man, however sunk in vice, and 
 ignorance, but owns some such rallying point, in his 
 character^ as this, of Hubert. It is commonly, however, 
 so coated over, with the rust of early associations, and 
 perverse impressions of '^ concentrated selfishness," (as 
 Moore designates it, in his life of Byron), or else, with the 
 centuried hoar of inherited iniquity, that it would seem 
 to ask a prophet's rod, to ^' raise the waters" in the rank 
 or sterile soil, and from beneath those shelvings and 
 layers, which have indurated, and incrusted the human 
 conscience. But, nevertheless, couched in some solitary 
 nook, or cranny, of the hard quarry, into which long pre- 
 judice, or bad nurture, or the taint of hereditary passion, 
 or the false, and harsh tutoring of adversity, hath meta- 
 morphosed the seat of life and tenderness, there doth 
 lurk, the one single, bright, and precious jewel, — the 
 pulse-throb of sensibility! the occult type, and evidence 
 of original humanity, more radiant far, than any gem or 
 pearl, hiding in the lap of earth, or in a bed of waters. 
 The main difficulty is, how to make this ray of heavenly 
 ore refulgent, so embedded is it, in the dross, and dirt of 
 earthy matter; but buried, though it be, and still, and 
 dormant, in its dark mine, yet, as, according to the com- 
 monest of proverbs, " every man has his weak point," so

 surely (thank God !) doth he likewise inherit this particle 
 of his divine origin, which is the key-note to all, that sanc- 
 tifies the present, and holds out a chance (however faint) 
 of a " new life unto righteousness." This deep vein of 
 feeling will assume every form, and degree of brightness, 
 agreeably to the infinite modifications, which appertain 
 to the lot of mortality. In Hubert, as we have said, it 
 took the shape of parental love. 
 
 ** His worn bosom and keen eye would melt. 
 Over the innocence of that sweet child. 
 The only shrine of feelings undefiled." 
 
 That pure shrine was now outraged, by the proposal of 
 Count Ragotzy, that he should consign the innocent, and 
 spotless girl to the "tender mercies," of such an enfeloned 
 monster, as was the Cygani chief; the bare imagination 
 of which, harrowed up every fibre of his soul. He felt, he 
 would as soon hand her over, in the helplessness of her 
 beauty, to the fangs of some wolf, from the recesses of 
 the krapacks, or deliver her, bound hand and foot, to the 
 inhuman caresses of some wet-lipped vampire, as condemn 
 her virgin purity of mind and person, to the marital de- 
 facement of the gipsy count. It was a kind of shrink- 
 ing horror, that curdled through his veins, at the nefan- 
 dous idea ; only the more intense, because, accompanied 
 with the remembrance of the power, and passions of the 
 being, whose offer inspired the sensation. In the first 
 burst of his indignation, he would have liked to immolate 
 the speaker to his resentment, and the next moment, he 
 owned the policy of governing his feelings, and tempo- 
 rizing with the facinorous insulter. Thus, while these 
 antagonist emotions wrestled, like strong athletes, in his 
 soul, he stood in silence, with his arms hanging listless by 
 his side, the veins of his forehead swollen, — his eyes dis- 
 tended, but fixed, — his lips now wide apart, and the in- 
 stant after, compressed with painful force. Only a father, 
 struggling in the gripe of a notorious homicide, (the 
 prodigy of a century,) can fully enter into the feelings of

 Vicchy, or comprehend those sudden spasms, which 
 arose at intervals, from the internal depths of thought, 
 and passed over his visage, like a dark cloud, working 
 his features into a convulsion. Out of this heaving of 
 the under current of his reflections, he was aroused, by 
 the voice of Count Ragotzy. 
 
 "What new gorgon's head dost glare at, man? Look 
 away — come, tell me, have I your permission to pay my 
 addresses to the lady Veronica ?" 
 
 " My lord," replied Vicchy, when he had collected and 
 calmed his voice to speak, in which he succeeded, with 
 
 some difficulty. " I but my child is young — the 
 
 predatory pursuits, in which you must needs be ever, 
 and inevitably engaged, would hardly accord with her 
 habits, and modes of thinking." 
 
 " Why, Eissenburg, what are you dreaming of?" 
 demanded Ragotzy ; '* My manner of life can be no ob- 
 jection. The lady Veronica, who, years ago, could jour- 
 ney on horseback, from Warsaw to Coloswar, and thence 
 to Vienna, can hardly be fastidious, on the score of having 
 to travel, were there a necessity, a few leagues with her 
 husband." 
 
 " Ha! sayestthou?" ejaculated Vicchy, " from War- 
 saw to Coloswar ! how meanest thou by that ?" 
 
 " Did she not?" asked Ragotzy, looking significantly, 
 and crossing his arms upon his broad chest, — " and so 
 young a thing as she was too! so no more of my itine- 
 rant habits. The daughter of her father ought to know, 
 what belongs to the wife of him, who prowls in the red 
 light of the moon." Vicchy clenched his teeth, and clos- 
 ing his two hands with such force, that the long nails 
 pierced through the flesh, with difficulty checked the im- 
 petuous answer, which rose to his lips. 
 
 " Come, come, Eissenburg," proceeded the Cygani, 
 " the violence of my love cannot brook delay — so I must 
 make suit for your intercession, with the lady Veronica." 
 
 Vicchy dared not trust his voice in reply.

 Count Ragotzy looked at him earnestly for a minute, 
 with an inquiring eye. " Eissenburg," at length he said, 
 in a low and deliberate tone, '' If I can obtain the favour 
 of the lady, I suppose you will consent to our union.'* 
 
 ** Never ! by the Lord of Heaven and Earth !" cried 
 Vicchy, with startling emphasis. " Never !" and then 
 remained silent. 
 
 *' Dare you reject my proffer?" demanded Ragotzy, 
 with kindling eyes. 
 
 " I have said," replied Vicchy, turning away, in silent 
 disdain. 
 
 ** This is prodigious !" exclaimed the Count, rising in 
 wrath ; *' consider my power, my wealth, my influence." 
 
 " Were they a hundred fold. Lord Ragotzy, what they 
 are," answered Hubert, in a decisive, but quiet tone, 
 " knowing what I know, my daughter should never, with 
 my consent, unite her fate to thine." 
 
 The eyes of the Cygani flashed fire. " Thou art not 
 mad ?" he exclaimed ; *' thou might'st be free, I tell you, 
 thy outlawry reversed, thy rank, thy office, thy wealth 
 restored ; all by my means." 
 
 '* Rank, office, wealth, in such a comparison, are vain 
 and flying vapours," replied Vicchy. *' Heaven's life ! 
 Yd rather linger out my days in this dungeon, and be 
 graved here alive, unrighted and unknown, than purchase 
 an empire of freedom, at such a price!" 
 
 The dark brow of Ragotzy, was stricken with red, and 
 he set his teeth hard — " But dost thou not dread my 
 vengeance, Vicchy ?" he demanded fiercely. 
 
 '^ Thou splendid robber !" made answer the other, giving 
 w^ay to the burst of uncontrolled, and irrepressible indig- 
 nation, which the subject inspired ; '* Thinkest thou, then, 
 so meanly of thy victim, as to suppose, I would sacrifice 
 my blessed, and innocent daughter to irremediable misery, 
 through fear of what thou canst do to me? Be un- 
 deceived. Lord Ragotzy! Thou boughtest me, 'tis true, 
 body and soul, for a mess of porridge ; yet, even on the

 bridge of the Vienne, in the perfect beggary of my for- 
 tunes, I accepted that funereal prosperity, thou shower'dst 
 on me, solely and singly, for the sake of my poor starv- 
 ing girl. Thinkest thou, if I could have imagined her 
 life was to be rescued, only that she should, in after-years, 
 become a property to advance thy politic ends, I would 
 not have spurned thee, and thy gold alike ? Oh ! rather 
 far, with fierce corrosives, would I have defaced my child, 
 until she were barked, and encrusted round, into one loath- 
 some leper, or, if that promised no salvation for her, have 
 let her fast, and decay, piecemeal, into the innocent grave 
 rd dug for her, and looked on with tearless eye, — ay! 
 dear, as Veronica is to my heart, — have smiled, as I heard 
 the stiffened clods rattling on her hearse, and triumphed, 
 to think, it pleased heaven to save one, I loved, from such 
 contamination and despair, as must be her portion, 
 whose cruel fate connects her with your lot." 
 
 It required no ordinary stimulus, to draw from Vicchy's 
 lips, such direct and uncalculating language, as the 
 foregoing ; nor was it often, that Count Ragotzy's ears 
 were fated to tingle at such, from any man. He was not 
 the person qui^cently, to brook opposition to his wishes, 
 more especially an opposition, couched in terms of dis- 
 respect, and opprobrium, but (as will sometimes happen,) 
 the very novelty of the occurrence, — his surprise, at what 
 he deemed the audacity of the speaker, overwhelmed, and 
 counteracted the instant, and adequate expression of that 
 resentment, which Vicchy's declaration was otherwise cal- 
 culated to elicit, ..a resentment, which, notwithstand- 
 ing his momentary calm, Ragotzy, in the very depths of 
 his soul, felt and acknowledged. His eyes sparkled, with 
 the glare of the most ferocious vindictiveness, as he ex- 
 claimed, " By all the powers of darkness ! thou shalt yet 
 pay dear for this insolence!" He stopped abruptly, 
 thrusting his right hand violently, within the folds of his 
 vest, and then, playing with the hilt of his dirk, with ner- 
 vous irritability, as if doubtful, whether the provocation,

 he had already received, justified his plunging the blade, 
 into the heart of the olfender. Well was it for Vicchy 
 then, that the ferocious chief was unaware of his 
 treacherous correspondence, with the Richter Iwan, and 
 had besides, by good fortune, been left in ignorance of 
 his having opened the packet. Count Ragotzy's know- 
 ledge of either of these dishonourable transactions, would 
 have been as bands of iron round the promptings of that 
 fierce temper, whose outbreak nearly choaked him. As 
 it was, the Cygani leader was fain to content himself with 
 imprecating, not a few of the Mano's blessings on the 
 head of his " circumspect" associate. And then, observ- 
 ing, that not another word escaped Vicchy, but that he 
 stood, as unmoved at his vehement vituperation, as some 
 firm rock at the light spray, which spits against its front, 
 Count Ragotzy, after glaring in the eyes of his quondam 
 follower, with the glance of a wild and wounded animal, 
 in a phrenzy of baffled rage, burst out of the dungeon. 
 
 Several days elapsed since the stormy proceedings 
 narrated above, and Vicchy, hearing nothing of Count 
 Ragotzy, began to flatter himself, that if his prison walls 
 shut him out from liberty, they were, in some measure, a 
 line of circumvallation, which protected him, from the 
 assaults and machinations of his late commander. Mean- 
 time, the wearisome continuity of his solitary rumina- 
 tions, was divided between vague apprehensions, for the 
 personal safety of his daughter, and an unsleeping 
 yearning, to learn the tenor of that folded-paper, w^hich 
 he carried under his vest. Veronica was punctual in her 
 visitings, and the old housekeeper, Judith, had been 
 daily permitted, to bring provisions of a better quality, 
 than the usual prison rations. 
 
 One morning, as the captive was entertaining himself 
 with sad meditations, upon his lot, the jailor entered, and 
 announced, that an order had come down from the 
 Lord Regent, directing, that Vicchy and other state- 
 prisoners should take exercise, at their pleasure, on the

 eastern rampart. To that fallen noble, wearied with the 
 dull succession of hour after hour, in his solitary dun- 
 geon, this privilege offered a most welcome relaxation. 
 It was the second morning, after the licence, we men- 
 tioned, had been vouschafed, that Vicchy leaned, with 
 one shoulder against the parapet, his thoughts busied, 
 with the strange fatality, that seemed to hang over his 
 house, and he was pondering, at the moment, on the ex- 
 traordinary coincidence of himself, and his lost brother, 
 having been engaged, in the same service, and incarce- 
 rated, in the same dungeon, when, suddenly, one, 
 wrapped, from head to foot, in the szilrod territs'd, (the 
 threadbare cloak distinctively worn, by the peasants of 
 the country) accosting him, in a low voice, by his name, 
 inquired, if he had any communication for the camp of 
 Iwan. *' I only arrived last night, and I am off to-morrow, 
 to join the Richter. I heard, by chance, of this indul- 
 gence to the state prisoners, and, at imminent risk, 
 have stolen here, to obtain a minute's speech of you." 
 
 Vicchy immediately recognized, in the diminutive form 
 and piercing eyes of him, who spake, the person of the 
 cunning agent, to whom, on several occasions, he had 
 betrayed the councils, and intended movements, so far as 
 he could ascertain them, of the Cygani leader, and thus, 
 not seldom, had enabled the great Richter to disconcert, 
 by a countermarch, the purposed ravages of Count Ra- 
 gotzy, and so, to disappoint that chief of his anticipated 
 booty. Many a Magyar Var had been saved from scenes 
 of rapine and murder, by the unexpected intervention 
 of the Richter Iwan, at the head of superior forces, till, 
 in course of time, the common people, from having re- 
 peatedly witnessed these coincident manoeuvres, and 
 remarked, how constantly the hostile demonstrations of 
 the Cyganis were opposed, by the advance of the Walla- 
 chian troops, and how invariably the latter put these 
 terrible freebooters to the right about, — began to dis- 
 tinguish the great Richter, by the appellation of their 
 Isten or god, and to mark their dread, and detestation of

 the gipsy leader, by designating him the Mano, or fa- 
 ther of all evil. Vicchy was overjoyed to encounter 
 one, unto whom, he thought, he might freely open his 
 mind ; and immediately proceeded to advise the Walla- 
 chian agent of every circumstance, that had happened, 
 since he last held colloquy with him, which was 
 about a week, prior to his arrest. At the conclusion, 
 though not without some hesitation, Vicchy slowly drew, 
 from his bosom, the folded mystery, which, for successive 
 days and nights, had drank up all the currents of his 
 soul, and frankly requested the other's assistance, to get 
 at its purport. The agent regarded the paper, at first, 
 with an air of languid curiosity; however, the instant his 
 quick eye lighted on the hand-writing, it gleamed like 
 that of a hyaena ; it was positively frightful, to catch the 
 changes of his countenance ; his whole nature seemed to 
 undergo a revulsion; his usually sallow complexion, 
 assumed a livid, and greenish tinge; the veins upon his 
 swart temples seemed swoln^ like corded lines, ready to 
 burst with stretching, whilst his piercing orbs shot forth 
 light, fast as the coruscations of twin meteors. Giving 
 a faint cry, like that of the falcon in his rage, while his 
 quivering lip strove, ineffectually, to body forth the 
 workings of his mind, he extended his bare arm to 
 clutch the paper, as that bird darts on his prey. 
 
 Vicchy, startled and astonished, by the abruptness and 
 vehemence of the movement, held it aloof; when, sud- 
 denly, the man's wrapping-mantle fell to the ground, 
 and disclosed the dwarf-like figure of the wearer ; he 
 was slightly clad — the vest or shirt of linen, hanging, 
 like a doublet, outside the hose, which was of white 
 cloth, was bound down by a broad leather girdle, and, 
 half hid by it, hung a naked, and curiously shaped knife ; 
 he wore no jacket or outer covering. The wide sleeves 
 of the shirt were open.* This person made more than 
 one ineffectual attempt to snatch the document, out of

 authority.

 the hands of Vicchy ; but, perceiving, from the superior 
 height and strength of his opponent, that he had no 
 chance of attaining his purpose, he desisted. Vicchy, 
 who found himself so strangely, and unexpectedly 
 obliged to contest the possession of that paper, whose 
 imagined importance was not a little enhanced, in his 
 estimation, by the mysterious effect, which it wrought 
 on his companion, at length drew sufficient breath, to 
 inquire, what had come to the Richter's very good friend 
 (as the man commonly styled himself), that he forgot his 
 gentle breeding, and played at bob- cherry, for what did 
 not belong to him V* 
 
 This remonstrance shortly brought matters to an ami- 
 cable issue ; — a parley ensued, the particulars of which 
 the reader will excuse our repeating ; but, ere the close 
 thereof, the Wallachian agent read, aloud, that prohi- 
 bited paper. With emotions electrical, and indescriba- 
 ble, Hubert's ears drank in the tidings ! — his head 
 swam ! — his heart leaped to his throat ! He stood upon 
 Mount Pisgah, and looked down, upon that promised 
 land, which, with prophetic ken, he had oft, before, be- 
 held, and compassed, as it were, with an eye of faith ; 
 and now, the wide perspective spread out, in all its glory 
 before his vision. A sudden gleam of light flashed upon 
 his mental eye. He conceived it all ; — his fond bosom 
 swelled, at the anticipation of the golden round, which 
 was to encircle the brow of his beloved daughter. The 
 Duke of Eissenburg returned to his dungeon anotlier 
 man.

 The scene shifts again to Hubert's cottage. It was on 
 thenight, immediately succeeding the afternoon, in which 
 Maximilian Count Pereny rose from his bed of sickness, 
 that two persons held a whispering, and hushed consul- 
 tation, in the little brick chamber, of which we have be- 
 fore made mention. Their voices were pitched so tremu- 
 lously low, they seemed to mock the listening sense, as 
 they talked over the interesting subject, they were 
 engaged in canvassing. They were seated close together, 
 and the gleamy lustre of their eyes, at intervals, reflected 
 the only light of the apartment.

 this very day, to the cardinal, by his nephew. I will 
 delay my confession no longer, — the outlawry of Vicchy 
 shall not be terminated, in his death. Discover to me, 
 then, at length, the real villain. Name him, that I may 
 denounce, to Martinuzzi, the murderer of the Princess 
 Beatrice. Hubert, I am positive, shall not lie under the 
 stigma of her abduction another day. It is time, he 
 should resume his rank and fortunes." 
 
 " Why thou art grown self-willed," returned the other, 
 speaking hardly over his breath. '^ Since when, hast thou 
 thought fit, to act in this of thine own judgment. I was 
 obliged, suddenly, to leave the capital, and it is only at 
 the peril of my safety, that, under cover of the night, 
 I have ventured back, to bear thee off with me. Even 
 while I speak, horses await us, in the lane, beyond the 
 precipice — let us, then, hasten thither ; every minute, we 
 spend here we are in danger." 
 
 *' To the precipice !" whispered the first speaker, whilst 
 his breath, audibly drawn in, through his clenched teeth, 
 attested his horror, at the proposal. " Think you, I 
 would again place my foot on that unhallowed ground, 
 with all its local associations weighing on me, — and at 
 this hour ? — not I, — wait till the daylight." 
 
 "Tush, tush, Albert; if I did not know thee for a 
 brave man," rejoined the other, in the same low whisper, 
 ** I should deem thee an arrant coward. — What ! wait 
 here, to be bayed, and hunted down, by some of the re- 
 gent's hell-hounds, who are on the track for me? — 
 I must begone ; promise me, at least, if you will not ac- 
 company me, my good fellow, that you do not spring 
 the mine, until I give the signal." 
 
 " But when will that be?" demanded the first speaker. 
 '* Recollect, how many years you have kept me in pur- 
 suit of empty shadows, and all the while, in ignorance of 
 the grounds of your flattering promises — why should 
 we longer procrastinate ?" 
 
 *' I tell you," replied the neighbouring voice, '' it must

 not be ; — to manifest our purpose, before circumstances 
 are ripe for it, were only to ruin ourselves, without hurt- 
 ing the man we aim at. Let us lie in wait — not long — 
 every thing promises a speedy issue." 
 
 "Ay, 'twas thus you spoke, when you prevailed upon 
 me to quit my prison, and escape, in your company. I 
 yielded then, because I doubted the continuance of Eis- 
 senburg's outlawry ; afterwards, I hastened hither, where 
 you have fooled me, day after day, on some frivolous 
 pretence or other. Now, however, that his life is in the 
 quivering of the balance, I hesitate not a moment 
 longer — he shall not suffer." 
 
 "Pshaw, man! you fret me. What's Eissenburg to 
 you — let the infatuated traitor perish." 
 
 " Ay, it is easy said, and easier done than said ; but, 
 he shall not perish, I tell you, charged with a crime of 
 which I can clear him, by acknowledging myself the 
 guilty party. I shall, to-morrow, obtain audience of the 
 regent, and fully exculpate Eissenburg." 
 
 " And much the regent will thank you ! Besides, 
 whom will you accuse? — you know not whose handy 
 work you did. A mere mercenary fool 1 — you know not 
 your employer's name. — Whose hongrees bribed you to 
 silence ? — you know not. Who now addresses you ? — 
 you know not. — A likely tale for Martinuzzi's ears !" 
 
 " Nevertheless," answered the voice, " it must be told. 
 Because I have been looked on with the evil eye * shall 
 Vicchy be brought to the scaffold V 
 
 " Think you," said the other voice, " that Vicchy was 
 arrested for his outlawry ? — If so, be undeceived ; he is 
 in prison, because he had connected himself, with the 
 bands of the Cyganis and Wallachians, whilst holding 
 command in the Transylvanian service. Such is his 
 offence, believe me."

 '' Is it possible, that his rank is not known ?" whis- 
 pered the other. '' Then, were he exonerated from the 
 charge, which caused his outlawry, his birth would 
 stand him in good stead. I shame to remain a puppet, 
 at the beck of one, you do well to remind me, I know 
 nought of. I'll see the cardinal to-morrow, and then 
 tell him all." 
 
 " And so will the man, that hired your servile sword, 
 never be brought up to justice," responded the other voice. 
 
 "You will be silenced, I can tell you that; but he." 
 
 "But he!" retorted the first speaker, " why Ae, why 
 not name his name ?" 
 
 " 'Twould choke you, were I to do so; nevertheless, 
 if you will engage to defer stirring in the matter, for only 
 one week longer, I will name his name ; and, after that 
 
 term " 
 
 " I am free to make my confession ?" said the other, 
 "If you then care to do so — if you dare. Will you 
 promise ?" 
 
 "Then, for one week, I defer my purpose — now, his 
 name — be brief." 
 
 " As thought, still, still, in your ear — let not the air 
 catch my words ; close, closer yet. I'll show you all ! 
 
 He is — shall I say it ? — he is " The speaker paused, 
 
 supporting himself on the shoulder of the eager listener, 
 and concluded, with whispering into his ear. 
 
 His interlocutor, as he heard the murmured communi- 
 cation, started back, and then grasped the other's arm. 
 "Great God of Heaven ! Oh, yet, deceive me not!" 
 he exclaimed, in a voice, which plainly evinced his in- 
 ward emotion. 
 
 " Thunder strike me I an you be not convinced of that, 
 I tell you, when, some day, you behold — but, hearken !" 
 he said, suddenly pausing. " Do you hear that ?" A door 
 was now heard to creak upon its hinges, and a heavy 
 step, sounded in the passage.

 ** Ha !" cried out one of the speakers, ^' who is't, that 
 issues, from the chamber of Hubert's child ?" and he 
 rushed out of the room. 
 
 It happened, on this evening, that the fair daughter of 
 Eissenburg retired to her sleeping-room, earlier than 
 usual. She was desirous of shunning her unmannerly 
 guest, that she might not subject herself to a repetition 
 of those disgraceful overtures, which had so sensibly 
 pained and humiliated her, in the instance, we have laid 
 before our readers. She knew, she could not answer for 
 the tone of her indignation, should Maximilian again 
 assail her; and, remembering the means, with which his 
 privileged greatness furnished him, of serving her father 
 in his extremity, she deemed it only an act of prudence, 
 to avoid encountering the Graf, while he chose to sojourn 
 under the same roof. Besides the motive, we have just 
 instanced, subjects of interest to her had lately evolved, 
 on which she wished to ruminate, in the privacy of her 
 chamber. She entered the room, and closing the door, 
 secured it, by shooting a small bolt into the staple. It 
 was a square apartment, of no great dimensions, open- 
 ing laterally from the narrow passage, of which we had 
 occasion to make mention, in an earlier chapter. The 
 flooring was of brick, and, as in the other apartments, 
 the walls were whitewashed. There might be observed 
 an aperture in the ceiling, through which, by daylight, 
 the outer crumbling rafters were visible. This made the 
 ever open entrance into that void, or loft, usual in 
 thatched roofs, throughout that region, and generally 
 destined, in the age, to which this history refers, as, in- 
 deed, we believe, at present, for implements of business, 
 and the lumber of the family. There was one window, 
 looking out upon those fragments of building, whose 
 neglected state, and rude and solitary appearance, we 
 have elsewhere described. The furniture of this diminu- 
 tive sleeping- room, as scanty as it was plain, consisted 
 of a sort of meagre bedstead, without curtains, occupying

 a narrow alcove ; an old oak table, supported on three 
 clumsy legs ; and two rickety chairs of withy. Upon 
 the table, lay open a copy of the New Testament, in the 
 Magyar tongue,* first printed, a few years before, at 
 Szigetvar, under the auspices of the philanthropic, and 
 pious Nadaschdy. 
 
 There are seasons, when the most thoughtless of the 
 sons, and daughters of Adam, are not sorry to escape 
 from the rush of this empty pageant world, and summon- 
 ing up, at will, those scenes and moments, which memory 
 pictures on the human heart, as with a sunbeam, haunt 
 the time with faces, long since mouldered away, in the 
 decomposition of the sepulchre, and review incidents, 
 long since elapsed, as they were, in their pristine vivid- 
 ness. There is a melancholy pleasure, in thus placing

 are not without their use, to soothe the imagination, and 
 amend the heart. The transition from the past to the 
 present, is itself a startling, indeed, but salutary lesson, 
 which induces serious reflections upon the emptiness of 
 our being here, and its transient tenure. The frail nature 
 of all human ties, . . the evanescence of earthly friend- 
 ships, and earthly loves, . . the short-datedness of even 
 those finer sympathies, which seem to invest mortality 
 with the privilege of angelic natures, and which lend life 
 its best, though falsest colouring, . . the unreal charac- 
 ter, . . the mutability of all that seems, on this side of the 
 grave, is thus brought directly home to our consciousness, 
 with due, and impressive contrast. This communion with 
 our bosoms seasons, and softens us, and it is seldom we do 
 not rise, from such meditations, in that chastened mood, 
 which alone is befitting the inheritor of "an enduring 
 substance in futurity." 
 
 In some such frame of mind, " her vespers done," did 
 Veronica abstractedly seat herself, at the foot of the 
 couch, preparatory to divesting herself of her day-clothes. 
 The tremulous rush taper, which stood upon the table, 
 seemed to the lonely enthusiast to typify, in the precari- 
 ous indistinctness of its light, the sinking of her own 
 heart, where hope itself appeared to wane, in the accu- 
 mulation of her difficulties and grief. Vague glimmer- 
 ings of, she knew not what, like warning spectres, 
 haunted the time, in which she listlessly prepared for bed. 
 Lost in reverie, her outer garment was laid aside. Me- 
 chanically, she unbuttoned the glass beads of her fragrant 
 boddice, and bared the round full beauty of her neck, and 
 shoulders ; her voluminous tresses, loosened from all 
 thrall, by the removal of their simple coronal, became 
 suffused over her marmorean loveliness, and, skirting her 
 feet, sported at large below the plaits of her snowy kirtle. 
 Thus, " like a mermaid in sea-weed," she sat, with 
 one fair cheek embedded in her hand, her elbow resting 
 on her knee, pondering, on the vicissitudes of her past

 life, and trying her best to extract some consolation, in 
 the prospect of the future. She recalled her mother's 
 presence, and her mother's example, and her loss — " the 
 greatest," says a modern writer, most truly, " which upon 
 entering life, a female can sustain." Weeping, to think 
 how much, at that moment, she needed her fostering care, 
 an additional sense of loneliness came upon Veronica. 
 Presently, her meditations reverted to her imprisoned 
 sire. She could not but be conscious, that, to a certain 
 extent, he had himself drawn down on his head his present 
 misfortunes. This was a consideration, which carried her 
 thoughts still further back, to the period of her child- 
 hood — to the tragic day, from which she dated all her 
 father's disasters. It was that, on which he left her, in the 
 chateau of Count Rodna, to accompany into the forest, 
 one, whom he knew to be a murderer, and who, only a 
 few hours afterwards, re-steeped his soul in blood-guilti- 
 ness. Then, by no uncommon association of ideas, arose, 
 to her recollection, the dreadful deposit — the packet — 
 the violation of which seemed, as it were, to have ante- 
 dated the consummation of all, she apprehended. It 
 renewed her spirit's agony, to recal the mysteries of that 
 dreadful night ; and a whole host of half-buried terrors 
 were running riot through her brain, when, all at once, 
 her ears seemed to catch the sound of suppressed breath- 
 ing. Thus abruptly brought back to a sense of present 
 circumstances, she quickly disengaged herself, from her 
 superincumbent tresses, and glanced narrowly round the 
 dusky room. Her eye lit upon nothing unusual, and she 
 faintly smiled at the weakness, which suggested her appre- 
 hensions. Having trimmed her little taper, the maiden 
 again prepared for bed. 
 
 " By degrees, 
 
 Her white attire creeps rustling to her knees." 
 
 While divesting herself of her remaining nadrag, or 
 underdress, the bent of Veronica's thoughts resumed

 their former train. She mused on the mysteries of the 
 packet, and on the voice, which had so strangely sounded 
 forth that eventful evening. For the hundredth time, 
 she marvelled within herself, who had removed those 
 papers from the chest, beneath the window-seat? who 
 could have divined, their having been there deposited? 
 and who could have had an interest, to purloin them? 
 What, if their contents were, indeed, pregnant with those 
 consequences, which her father anticipated? Into whose 
 possession had the momentous secret fallen? Next, she 
 thought of the disguised stranger, and how, on the eve 
 following her father's arrest, he had visited her, claiming 
 to be the owner of the packet. Hitherto, her ideas had 
 wandered without aim or object, but here they seemed 
 rooted, as by some inexplicable spell. She recalled his 
 towering form, wrapped in the Wallachian pelisse. She 
 again trembled, at his threatening and intemperate dis- 
 course: — she thrilled beneath the recollection of those 
 accents, which rung on her sense, like the echo, or in- 
 distinct memory, of some horrible dream. 
 
 Among the shadowy things, her imagination conjured 
 up, there arose a thousand strange, and horrid images of 
 violence and bloodshed ; — still, all was so confused, that 
 she could not determine where, or when she before trem- 
 bled at that voice. — " But ah !" she murmured to herself, 
 as her nadrag fell unsupported to her ancles; " tones, 
 such as those, once heard, live in the memory for ever, 
 though, under what circumstances they first impressed 
 me, I cannot call to mind, yet I feel, I would not wil- 
 lingly listen to such again." She ceased, wondering 
 what was the secret spell, that hung over her mind ; and 
 striving to shake off a depression, not unmixed with awe, 
 she approached the bed. Here the maiden involuntarily 
 paused, with a misgiving at her heart, as if there were 
 an adder couched between those sheets. Thus, she 
 stood, with no unbecoming feeling of mingled pride, and 
 diffidence; pride, which it was not in her sex not to

 MANUSCRIPT XV. 91 
 
 entertain, — and diffidence, such as belonged to a child, 
 only consummated, by the superior intelligence of the 
 woman. While, in the genial glow of maiden adolescence, 
 of incipient womanhood, she hesitated, for a few mo- 
 ments, and found in herself an invincible repugnance to 
 concealment, in the bed-clothes, a low suspiration — the 
 slightest ever breathed along the chords of the heart, 
 seemed to melt away on her ear. Already, her one foot 
 was planted on the ticking-sack of loose feathers, which, 
 in those days, formed the sole substitute for every other 
 coverlet. She reverted her head , and casting the volume 
 of her glossy hair backwards, over her alabaster neck and 
 snowy shoulders, paused, panting and dismayed, with 
 her right hand, against her palpitating and still white 
 bosom, and a fair finger sealing her coral lip. In such 
 innocent, and charming attitude, she held her respira- 
 tion for a while ; her sense of the attendant circum- 
 stances, of night and solitude, while it aggravated the 
 creative fancy of the maiden, almost too much for suf- 
 ferance, heightened the trembling grace, . . the exqui- 
 site fascination of her posture. — " Methinks," at last, 
 observed the wrapt damsel, in a musing soliloquy; 
 " sweet melody is born nder the moon, this clear night, 
 and the air is full of pathos; 'tis strange, how sad I am, 
 as if a heavy sense of woe to come, weighed, like lead, 
 upon my spirit; but the clinging feeling is that man, — 
 wherefore should the thought of his dark vizor disquiet 
 me so? Why, at this instant, do I feel such intense in- 
 quisitiveness about the face, that vizor hid from me? 
 Would that the fancy would pass away! but, even now, 
 that countenance seems glassed in my heart of hearts, 
 however the misty haze of years may have dimmed the 
 reflection. I look there for memory, and, as through 
 a veil, encounter a horrible presentment, like a tenanting 
 spectre, amid a mass of ruins ; there throng upon the 
 solitude of my brain, in chequered shadow and light, 
 an incongruous assemblage of wild phantoms ; but that

 man's red arm, thrust forth between me and happiness, 
 is a part of all. Why these vague terrors and gloomy 
 presages? do they point at death? No, no ! and yet, 
 ■what is it I forbode ! Wherefore this deep, dull despon- 
 dency ? what doth it portend ? What nameless disquietude, 
 like damp despair, can have gone over my soul, to 
 weigh me down, till the very orisons, I send up yonder, 
 seem beaten back? Dishonour and shame cumber the still 
 air, and sit, like incubus, on their apprehensive, and de- 
 voted victim. A cold creeping awe, like the awful whis- 
 perings of coming calamity, tingles in my flesh ! — ha ! 
 who's there? — Silly girl, — twas but your own breathing." 
 — Again ! — dear me ; I feel, to-night, as if that masked 
 man were lurking near me, — near me, — yet would be near- 
 er. Oh ! I do believe it were better, than this torture, if 
 he even stood there, so I might see his face.'' 
 
 Again Veronica, unable to overcome her reluctance to 
 get into bed, stepped upon the floor, slid her feet into her 
 yellow slippers, and throwing a light wrapper loosely 
 over her szoknyabaUf or short under *' cutty-sark,"* 
 paced, with unequal steps, round the solitary chamber. 
 Every thing began to take a false colouring, from the 
 morbid condition of her thoughts; the very night-breeze, 
 as it whistled past the casement, had something sinister. 
 " Why," she internally resumed ; *' do I feel this desola- 
 tion in my mind ? — not lonely, but worse. Why, at this 
 hour, more than yesternight, or any preceding night? 
 Would I could speak to Judith, to break this unnerving 
 silence, — it were some relief. But that I fear to light upon 
 the cardinal's nephew, I'd go and rouse her." In this 
 state of torture, she remained for many minutes, which 
 were long hours, to the apprehension of the maiden. At 
 last, having resolved to brave her weakness, she threw 
 open the casement. The chill breath of the nocturnal 
 wind, wafted coolness into the close chamber, and came 
 freshly over her forehead, with a sense of sympathy, and

 companionship. She owned, to use the words of him, 
 whom Sir Walter Scott truly designated " the most ima- 
 ginative of bards," 
 
 " It mingled strangely with her fears. 
 Yet it felt like a welcoming."* 
 
 All was still around, save where the nightingale be- 
 guiled the silence, with " liquid notes, that closed the 
 eye of day." The scarcely waning moon diffused her 
 softening radiance, by snatches, upon the wild and dilapi- 
 dated waste below, kissing, into animation, the repose 
 and solitude of the wreathing blades ofunwaving grasses, 
 which sprung up, on all sides, and clad the ruinous pre- 
 cincts with an abundant vest. The ineffable influence 
 of the hour sank down holily, on the maiden's heart, and 
 inspired a strain of meditation, that, like mental music, 
 chimed to a solemner chord, and calmed her feelings to 
 a serener tone. The unswerving stars, studded thick 
 the purple depth of space, and Veronica lifted up her 
 eye, from the scene of rugged desolation, and decay, 
 which told of that mortality and change, which is the 
 irrevocable lot of man, and all his works, to where the 
 high arch of heaven rose, in calm stability, and immutable 
 duration. She slowly raised her eyes, even as her soul 
 might have turned away, from the vicissitudes of time, 
 to the contemplation of eternity. Her thoughts were 
 carried forward from the world of man, its cares, its fol- 
 lies, and its crimes, to hold commune with a being, in- 
 finitely good and great. — Upos to alhop efiXEney.* . . 
 The hour became religion ; and, as she mused, on the 
 future, — on immortality, — and endless rest, the grand, 
 solemn stillness of night, came, replete, with a power to 
 absorb, if not cheer, her desolation. She continued 
 watching the delicately tinted vapours, every now and 
 then crossing the moon's orbit, sometimes wholly eclipsing 
 her light, and occasionally melting in her radiance, until

 a sensation of numbness and cold, induced her to think 
 of closing the casement. Nevertheless, during many 
 minutes afterwards, it remained as it was, ; for still there 
 lingered, in her mind, a strong, but unaccountable repug- 
 nance, to enclosing herself anew in that room, and so, as 
 it were, shutting herself out, from the protecting eyes of 
 Heaven. Determined, however, to master this inwardje- 
 lunctance, which she could neither readily combat, nor 
 assign any rational cause for, she stretched out her hand, 
 to reach the catch of the casement, but again, her ear 
 fancied a sudden, and indistinct rustling, somewhere near 
 her. She instinctively listened, and she could not, a 
 second time, believe it imaginary ; — the uplifted hand 
 fell, nerveless, by her side, and, for a minute, she feared 
 to turn her head. 
 
 At length, summoning all her courage, she looked 
 round, but saw nothing, to warrant her apprehensions. 
 ** I am but a fool," she murmured, indignant at herself, 
 for what she deemed most inexcusable weakness. She 
 was again on the point of closing the casement, when, 
 gazing out into the moonlight, she discerned, distinctly, a 
 dark object emerge, like a shadow, from behind one of 
 the mouldering tenements of the demesne. Her breath, 
 indeed, grew a little thick, but the figure fascinated her 
 gaze, beyond the power of withdrawal. It paused for a 
 second, and then passed stealthily athwart the dew- 
 spangled enclosure, here and there bounded by a broken, 
 but still lofty wall. Having reached this barrier, the 
 figure carefully removed some rampant shrubs, and, 
 taking out certain large, square, loose stones, showed a 
 little postern door, through which he made his exit. 
 The incident was, by no means, adapted to calm her per- 
 turbed imagination, nor could she conjecture, what in- 
 ducement any person had to haunt those premises, at 
 that hour of the night. Deeming, however, all other ap- 
 prehensions to be purely ideal, she instantly shut, and 
 secured the window. This occupation of a minute was

 MANUSCRIPT XV. 95 
 
 no sooner over, than there again arose a stifling sensation 
 at her heart, as if her soul shrunk at, and grappled with, 
 some strange, unimaginable presentiment. She strove, in 
 vain, to grasp its precise nature, for, though it implied 
 that something terrible was, even now, on the eve of ac- 
 complishment, what her fears pointed at, was not tangible 
 to her apprehension. 
 
 In this state of hesitancy, she lay back in her chair 
 for several minutes, with her eyes partially closed, un- 
 determined how to act, half ashamed of her chimerical 
 fears, but finding it impossible, in spite of her every 
 effort, to argue herself into tranquillity. Her rapt 
 thoughts, meanwhile, involuntarily fell into their former 
 train ; and the complicated horrors of that night, when 
 the invisible voice vibrated at her elbow, and her eye 
 first glanced at those gouts of blood, which inhibited 
 the opening of the packet, gathered, in all their inscrutable 
 mysteriousness, on her imagination. Gradually, a con- 
 fused reverie invaded her faculties, the objects around 
 became, less and less, distinct, till, in an imbecile mood 
 of mingled fact and fiction, v/ith an oppression brooding 
 on her heart, like a sense of guilt, Veronica came to doze 
 upon that seat. She slept, indeed, but such sleep was 
 terrible. Her waking sensations accompanied her, with 
 fantastic fidelity, into the land of visions, and, scattered 
 and split, into a thousand indistinct reminiscences, sunk, 
 with awful pressure, on her mind, as if she were a pre- 
 doomed victim. Intense suffering, almost too mighty 
 for endurance, and which, from some peculiar, and in- 
 scrutable cause, might, not unaptly, be termed intuitive 
 remorse, was evidenced in the spasmodic heavings of her 
 chest. Her breath came and went, in deep-fetched, and 
 convulsive sobs, and her indefinable emotions seemed to 
 impel the starting tear, and thrill the creeping vein. 
 More than once, and whether she were sleeping or awake, 
 she scarcely knew, she thought, she felt the slow move- 
 ment of death-cold hand, over her face and neck, and

 could disting-uish its contact to that urn of alabaster,' 
 where the impatient heart seemed struggling for life. A 
 thousand hideous feelings of abandonment beleaguered 
 her. She instinctively shuddered. Her blood curdled, 
 for the manual pressure on her panting breast resembled 
 not the actual touch of mortality. The groping hand, 
 whose palpable chillness, as it passed gently to and fro 
 over the quivering flesh, conveyed a horrid impression 
 of its reality, was, at length, suddenly withdrawn, and 
 the indescribable terror, associated with the remembrance 
 of the packet, transferred itself to Veronica's sleeping 
 fancies, but, mingled with intolerable mental anxiety, 
 and a loathing of every fibre of her body, at some fate 
 or crisis, which was actually impending, without her 
 having the power to avert it. 
 
 " For all seemed guilt, remorse, or woe. 
 Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame."* 
 
 Soon, the vague, and well-nigh insupportable incubus, 
 '* without form and void," beneath whose leaden power, 
 her energies unconsciously succumbed, clothed itself in 
 the caverns of memory, and assumed a more defined, 
 but not less dreadful character. She thought, that she 
 was a child once more, and, owing to an uncontroulable 
 impulse, that she was again looking through a crevice, 
 in some apartment, as had happened to be her lot, many 
 years before, in the chateau of Count Rodna. However, 
 with the usual incoherence of dreams, she had no con- 
 sciousness of where she was- — the circumstance being the 
 simple impulse of memory in her slumber, if^ indeed, 
 slumber it were. Then, as at present, she was clad only 
 in her night robe. There chanced, however, this trifling 
 variation ; — the gap, or interstice, through which she 
 wow dreamed, she gazed, was not placed in the wainscot, 
 but OVER-HEAD, and consisted of an open trap-door

 wrought, in the deling of the room, where she imagined 
 herself. Nevertheless, by the magic of dreams, she re- 
 traced, with all the force of reality, the fearful scene 
 which her father, and the assassin, enacted on that me- 
 morable occasion. The incitement to murder, . . the up- 
 braiding, . , the temptation recurred to her memory, with 
 the vividness of recent occurrence. Then she beheld the 
 villain draw the parchment from his vest, and hold it 
 before the eyes of Eissenburg, and she could read the 
 words, which were the language of the script of blood, 
 found on her father's hearth — " Would you destroy 
 
 BODY AND SOUL ? OFFICIOUS FOOL ! OPEN THE DEPOSIT, 
 
 CONFIDED TO YOU, AT YOUR PERIL!" and, immediately, 
 by a rapid transition, natural to dreams, she thought, 
 she rested upon the window-seat, beneath which, Hu- 
 bert had cast the writings of the packet. There she 
 sat, and, right before her, stood a tall figure, and 
 it was the Wallachian stranger, masked and silent. 
 Fearfully she gazed upon him, and then said aloud, 
 " What would you have?" — and he fixed his dark eyes 
 upon her earnestly, ^and made answer, " I will have 
 thee, Veronica of Eissenburg, for my wedded wife ;" — 
 and she seemed, to herself, to reply, — " thinkest thou, 
 I will marry a man, whose face I know not;" — and he 
 said, " Over the hills, maiden, I have a home for thee ; 
 come, and we'll rest us on the way, i' the emerald spots, 
 by quiet fountains ; so come, with me, to where the cur- 
 tained encampment of my fathers' is set up, and then, 
 if thou still wishest it, thou shalt view my face ; — shall 
 we not go together?" — But she demurred, saying, '* Only 
 show me thy countenance, and do with me according 
 to thy pleasure, for T must e'en submit." Instantly 
 she felt, as if his powerful hands were grasping her 
 choking throat, and that, holding her roughly to him, 
 he dragged her along. All resistance seemed in vain ; 
 in spite of her incessant struggles, and abortive attempts 
 to shriek, she could neither successfully oppose, nor es-

 cape the convulsive embrace, that strained her to his 
 breast. A mixed sensation, made up of ill defined horror, 
 and excruciating fear, froze her inmost soul : — it was a 
 period of strange, and intolerable consciousness ; she 
 having an obscure conception, all the while, that, 
 though she dreamt, her dream was the type of some re- 
 volting reality. Then ensued the worst moment of her 
 nightmare, in which she thought, she was being whirled 
 away, still locked in the arms of the masked stranger, 
 through illimitable space, and that clouds, and vapours 
 were rolling, before her dizzy eyes ; and, at length, that 
 a paroxysm of pain and terror, suspended her faculties, 
 and, in that pang, she dreamed, that she swooned 
 away. *****

 The vision now changed its every characteristic. She 
 was strolling on the pebbly banks of the Olt, whose lan- 
 guid waters, slow and silently, slide away, beneath the 
 thick growth of fainting rushes, like conscious guilt. 
 By her side was a noble youth, and however evanescent 
 the circumstances, which were connected with his remem- 
 brance, the knowledge of who was her companion, in- 
 sensibly rose within her. He was that boy, whom she 
 once beheld in her childhood, only for a few hours, on 
 the frightful evening, we commemorated, in the chateau of 
 Count Rodna. The face and form were the same, and 
 yet again, how different! All the characteristics which 
 distinguished the beautiful boy were developed, into manly 
 comeliness and grace. Veronica gazed entranced, and 
 the bright false imagination of sleep gilded those minutes 
 of delusion, with a touch of bliss, that scarcely any wak- 
 ing reality of joy might parallel. She dreamed the 
 youth told her, with many honeyed words, that he loved 
 her ; and she listened to the flattering tale, as young 
 maids will listen, when their hearts are in the case ; that 
 is, she felt she blushed, and so averted her head, and was

 silent. Suddenly, just as she thought that he found favour 
 in her sight, and that she had gathered courage to tell him 
 as much,* her hand was snatched, from the close clip of 
 her gallant, and on looking up, she received a shock, that 
 thrilled through all her nerves. Her young companion, 
 with that facility of transformation, incident to dreams, 
 had changed into the tall figure of a monk, clothed in 
 the habiliments of his order, having an immense leaden 
 crucifix, suspended from his girdle; and she thought he 
 cried out to her, in a fierce tone — " Hope not, fair here- 
 tic, to ascend a throne, over the ruins of my child's for- 
 tunes !" and she shook to hear him ; when straightwise 
 there approached a third person, in whom she again re- 
 cognised the masked Wallachian, and a war of words 
 arose, between him and the monk, about what she knew 
 not; but at the close, she lost sight of the ecclesiastic, 
 and was left on the fringed bank of the rivulet, alone, with 
 the vizored stranger ; and then, she dreamed, the Olah 
 led her on a long day's journey, and they traversed hills 
 and valleys, and penetrated forests, that seemed inter- 
 minable ; until, at last, as the sun was going down, they 
 entered upon a vast unbroken volyy, or plain, where were 
 spread, afar to the right and left, innumerable encamp- 
 ments, gay with twinkling pennons, and banners, and 
 bandrols, darkening the sunshine, and streaming among 
 the acacia branches, by which they were mostly overhung. 
 Around and about, apparelled in scanty raiment, of the most 
 showy colours, was a concourse of strange people, male 
 and female, in festive groups ; whilst the tabor and du- 
 delsack filled the air, with appropriate inspiration. A 
 drove of mules and asses, many laden with cumbrous 
 packages, and the rest browsing at large, filled up the 
 verdant slopes in the background ; whilst in the midst of 
 this gaudy metropolis, though far apart, and high above

 the common level, the lofty ensigns of a tent rose up, into 
 the air, like the minarets of a palace, gilded by the hori- 
 zontal rays. The voluminous vestments, of which the 
 canopy was composed, were of Indian cloth, and magnifi- 
 cent beyond all compare. Through the entrance of this 
 stately alfcmeque, she dreamt, that the Wallachian passed, 
 beckoning her to follow. She proceeded to draw aside 
 the flapping drapery, when, behold ! just as she penetra- 
 ted the inner muslin awnings, in the twinkling of an eye, 
 instead of finding herself under the canopy, she con- 
 ceived, that she was standing in an immense cave, which, 
 with intuitive recollection, she knew to be the same, 
 whither she had been transported by the gipsy hag, in 
 her early childhood ; and, seated at the further end of 
 this cave, was that Boszorkany , who, holding, in her 
 long skeleton fingers, a golden crown, lifted up her voice, 
 at the sight of Veronica, " Welcome, royal lady !" she 
 exclaimed, " receive, at my son's hands, the regalia of 
 St. Stephen :" and then, she thought, the Wallachian, 
 having taken the crown, from the hold of the sorceress, 
 directly advanced, to where she was stationed, and would 
 have presented her with the sacred gift, but the dream- 
 ing maid drew back, and, falling upon one knee, the 
 thought which was uppermost in her mind, rushed, in- 
 voluntarily, to her lips, — she said, or seemed to herself to 
 say,—" I only accept, sir stranger, the splendid offer- 
 ing, provided you will remove your mask ;" and he 
 made answer, '' then so be it. Arise, fair daughter of 
 Eissenburg, and behold !" and he raised his hand to his 
 vizor, and she thought she did arise, whilst an intense 
 feeling of curiosity came over her, and, in the awful 
 suspense, and anxiety of that moment, she opened her eyes. 
 It was gradually, that Veronica, 
 
 " Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,"* 
 
 broke the bounds, which divide slumber from con- 
 sciousness, and freed her spirit, from the prison of

 sleep. Very slowly she came to recollect, how, and 
 where her somnolency first stole over her. Rapidly 
 changing her position, she looked around, with a gaze 
 of bewilderment ; then, as her vision strengthened, 
 memory began to work,— her beautiful breast heaved, 
 she gasped for breath, and sat up erect, in her uncur- 
 tained bed, bathed in a dew of vague, wildering terror. 
 The taper was dying in the chimney, and the last flicker 
 of its expiring light played upon the staring visages of 
 two human creatures, standing in front of her couch ; 
 the same, that had just appeared to her, in the last chi- 
 mera of her dream. There was stationed the tall, meao-re 
 hag, presenting the like aspect, and clothed in the same 
 uncouth habiliments, as the abstraction of her alom^ had 
 pictured ; and, nearer yet, stood the stately form of 
 the Wallachian, and the mask was off. Veronica 
 felt her senses reeling, under the horrid excitement ; she 
 dashed her little palm rapidly, and tremblingly across 
 her brow — was she sane ? or, — again her eyes strained 
 strongly towards his face, and the sluices of memory 
 were broken up, and poured, in a full flood of horror, 
 from her heart to her brain. She beheld the same 
 handsome features, which, for the only time in her life, 
 she had caught sight of, through the chink in the wain- 
 scot of Count Rodna's chateau ; she, at once discovered 
 the Wallachian chief to be no other, than that execrable 
 assassin. Being abruptly roused from her distempered 
 dream, only to have her sight blasted, by the actual 
 presence, in her very bed-chamber, of the abhorred per- 
 petrator of those detested tragedies, down whose wild 
 habiliments, even now, trickled a streamlet of blood ; it 
 was no wonder, she felt her heart's current rapidly failing, 
 through all its arteries. A deadly mist came over her 
 eyes; the presentment became too terrible. ** Great 
 God! my dream ! and / in bed T she shrinkingly ex- 
 claimed ; and the next minute went off" into insensibilitv.

 Let US beat back a few pages. Perhaps, the reader may 
 not have forgotten, that one of the twain, who were in 
 dark conference, in the adjoining chamber, rushed out, on 
 hearing a heavy tread proceed, from Veronica's sleeping 
 apartment. This person was no other, than our ancient 
 acquaintance Judith, who halted for an instant, before 
 she could discern any object. At length, however, the 
 light of a taper fell upon the figure of a man, wrapped, 
 from head to foot, in a capacious mantle ; he was stand- 
 ing in the door-way of the damsel's bed-room. 
 
 '' Eternal infamy! whence came you ?" demanded the 
 housekeeper. 
 
 The other, whom we have elsewhere denominated the 
 Wallachian, stared in surprise. "■ Thence," he replied, 
 pushing back the chamber door, and at the same time, 
 perhaps, by way of clearing the decks for action, putting 
 the light upon the paved flooring : " Ha ! infamous 
 villain !" rejoined Judith, springing towards the amazed 
 intruder, with an impetus, that made the walls shake 
 again, and seizing him, by the upper cape of his 
 pelisse. 
 
 The stranger turned fiercely upon her: "Here's a 
 fury," he exclaimed, " by hell ! she'll throttle me, — hold 
 off your hands, you harridon, or I'll " 
 
 The aggressor, however, with a firm, muscular, and ner- 
 vous gripe, clung to his throat and breast. 
 
 *' Cease ! art thou mad ?" exclaimed the stranger, his 
 lip quivering with anger, at the assault. " I will not be 
 so hugged. Nay, then," he added, fixing a demoniac, 
 yet contemptuous glance on the housekeeper, whilst he 
 forcibly loosened his right arm, preparatory to drawing 
 his weapon: "Thus, I cut the connection," and in less 
 time than is filled by the telling, the keen poignard of 
 the Wallachian, aimed with the utmost accuracy, and 
 strength of arm, pierced the heart of Judith, who, with a 
 loud moan, fell bathed in her blood, at the other's feet. 
 
 At this instant, the same individual, who, a short while

 before, had been holding a dialogue, with Judith, in the 
 next apartment, made his appearance, and on perceiving 
 the housekeeper, stretched upon the earth, uttered an ex- 
 clamation — "Good God! Count Ragotzy," he cried, 
 " why have you done this ?" 
 
 *' To save myself from being strangled, by those ama- 
 zonian talons," replied the other drily. 
 
 " My lord, your passion has undone the labour of 
 years, — you have slain our chiefest witness." 
 
 ^' How so, Swartz?" said the count, " wherein would 
 that old crone prove a witness ?" 
 
 " That crone," replied Swartz, " is the very man, 
 whom he hired to carry off the Princess Beatrice, from 
 Pereny." 
 
 " Oh ! then, 'tis none of the beau sexe after all, — that 
 accounts for the strength of those fangs," said Ragotzy. 
 
 " Nay, my lord," resumed Swartz ; '* do you not per- 
 ceive, by this unlucky chance, the evidence, that would 
 bring home the abduction of the princess, falls to the 
 ground." 
 
 " Hark, thee, sir keeper," replied Ragotzy ; '' you are 
 continually, I have remarked, for some reason or other, 
 harping on the name of the Princess Beatrice — there, you 
 start, and change colour!" 
 
 A perturbed expression did, indeed, for a moment, 
 pass over the sinister countenance of Swartz ; however, 
 he clinched his teeth, and made no reply. 
 
 " Now," continued the count, *' if you'd have me join 
 in your projects, mention the sister of dead Zapola no 
 more, — what thou art drilling thy fertile brains about, 
 passes my conception. Be assured, I want no other evi- 
 dence, than what will suffice to establish the title of the 
 daughter of Eissenburg ; therein, both my personal am- 
 bition, and my revenge on him, will be amply gratified; 
 and to tell you a truth, which I've only learned myself 
 within this hour, — my love also. But how comes it our 
 mother have not yet arrived ? I expected her ere this."

 " I left her at the base of the precipice," said Swartz, 
 " with four of the troop. She is on a visit to the vaults, 
 and I hied hither, in the hopes of prevailing, on the man 
 you have slain, to leave Hermanstadt, under our escort. 
 But yourself, my lord, where have you lain ensconced all 
 the while ?" 
 
 *' Over head with the rats, till lately," answered 
 Ragotzy. 
 
 " How? — and the lady?" inquired Swartz, casting a 
 penetrating glance, upon the count. 
 
 " Is in bed, my good catechiser," said the other, with- 
 out a more direct reply, meeting his associate's look, with 
 a peculiar smile, — Ilia nisi in lecto, — and he added, after a 
 pause, " you know, that's a rule nisi, laid down by an 
 authority." 
 
 In saying these words, a remarkable expression 
 gleamed across the features of the Cygani, which Swartz 
 knew not how to construe. " My lord," he began — 
 
 " Nay, God-a-mercy," interrupted the Cygani, "never 
 raise thine eyes to Heaven. She hath hitherto slept, or 
 been as tranquil — " 
 
 " Alaric, is every thing in readiness?" exclaimed the 
 energetic voice of Unna, as she strode through the 
 kitchen, to the spot, where Ragotzy and Swartz were 
 talking. 
 
 " Mother, the lady sleeps," said Ragotzy. 
 
 '' How? have you not prepared her for her journey?" 
 asked Unna, with some surprise. 
 
 <' Why, she looks so beautiful in repose," replied 
 Ragotzy, while a slight smile was visible, at the corners of 
 his mouth, " that methought it were a pity to spoil the 
 picture of her rest." 
 
 '^ She should not have been suffered to retire to her 
 couch at all," said Unna, in a tone of asperity; " but 
 which is the room ?" 
 
 '^ To the right," answered the other; '' I'll follow you, 
 for I wish to see those sapphire orbs unclose. Swartz,

 your company can be dispensed with ;" and Count 
 Ragotzy and Unna, passed into the chamber of the un- 
 protected daughter of Eissenburg. They planted them- 
 selves, for a moment, at the foot of the couch, to gaze 
 upon their victim, where supine she lay — 
 
 " Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain. 
 
 " She is fast, methinks," said Unna. 
 
 " Ay, as oblivion," returned her son. 
 
 In all the inborn, and unstudied grace of youthful inno- 
 cence, slumbered the lovely girl, like the downy cygnet, 
 nestling in a close covert, made up of matted rushes, and 
 her " own beauties." But it might be easily seen, that 
 the callow fowl is just now ruffled, by some internal 
 emotion, — her dishevelled tresses went streaming, like 
 light, over the pillow and rug, — one waxen rounded arm 
 hangs listless, without the bed clothes, — her fair cheek is 
 buried in the palm of her left hand, whilst on the other 
 cheek, like a poplar leaf in autumn, that will redden and 
 turn pale alternately, as the wind sighs, there quivered 
 that false, and spectral hectic, which is commonly, at 
 least as symptomatic of the mind's fever, as of the body's. 
 A single and arrowy vein, marked distinctly on the marble 
 whiteness of her skin, meandered, like the tendril of a 
 vine, over her temple, — her breathing was a gentle sus- 
 piration, though only obtained in snatches — 
 
 " And there she lay, as innocent and mild, 
 As daisy born in dew."t 
 
 " Rise, daughter of Eissenburg!" cried Count Ra- 
 gotzy, at length. 
 
 Veronica, after a succession of fitful sobs, slowly

 opened her eyes, and, as we have already told, shortly 
 after went off into convulsions. 
 
 *' Alaric," said Unna, *' what's now to be done ?" 
 
 " There is nothing for it," said her hopeful son, '' but 
 to bear her off, in her present oblivious condition. Do 
 you officiate, and clothe her w^armly ; mind me, the 
 damsel will be as light as a dove, in the arms of her 
 bridegroom : but I will leave you, for I would change a 
 word with that unfathomable volunteer of ours, in the 
 next chamber." 
 
 " Unfathomable, and perchance false!" muttered Unna. 
 She paused, in evident constraint, and her bold, bad 
 son, approaching the bed-head, exclaimed — 
 
 " Ah ! little think the sons of Erdely, to what strait, 
 at this hour, their rightful sovereign is reduced." 
 
 " Their future queen, you should rather say," ob- 
 served the Boszorkany , in a low voice, " but, I bid you 
 mark me, not at this hour, their rightful sovereign." 
 
 " I apprehend you not," said Ragotzy ; ''and I wish 
 to God, you would cease to buzz into my ears your vatti- 
 cinal deceptions." 
 
 Unna moved away a single step, and rather muttered, 
 than said distinctly, *' Perhaps, 'tis as well, thou dost 
 not apprehend me." Then, a dark shade of portentous 
 meaning crossed the hag's wrinkled brow, as, in a louder 
 voice, she added, " Thou knowest not the power of fate, 
 that power the heavens obey ; and 'tis as well, or — 
 but art thou nailed there, — we are a loitering." 
 
 Count Ragotzy's dark eye still lingered on the mar- 
 bly face of the unconscious Veronica, with an expres- 
 sion, that it might be difficult to define. '' A coronet 
 were the only tire, meet for that brow," he murmured, 
 " and so, 'tis well I am provided. In truth, good mo- 
 ther," he proceeded, raising himself from his bent po- 
 sition, " 'tis an exquisite wench, though somewhat of 
 the deadest, and her exuberant lips break out in odours, 
 such as never fail red roses, when they die. But you

 say rightly, we loiter ;" and he made towards the door. 
 *' Our fleet steeds," he added, turning his head, '' will 
 have to make up for lost time, and travel as swift, I 
 fancy, as any sailing cloud that cuts the empty air; 
 yet not," he muttered to himself, in a lower tone, as he 
 closed the door behind him, '' not, with the speed of hu- 
 man thoughts, stung to action ' by the snake me- 
 mory.' "* 
 
 That body, stretched out across his path, and welter- 
 ing in the gushing purple of life, over which, already 
 apparently a corpse, Count Ragotzy had to step, might 
 have suggested to him a yet more awful similitude ; but, 
 notwithstanding that the education, with which Father 
 Dominick had enriched his mind, tended to quicken, and 
 cultivate his spontaneous inclination to such sort of asso- 
 ciations and resemblances, the apposite consideration 
 of their intended rate of progress, having been far ex- 
 ceeded, by the swift flight of the liberated soul, from 
 time to eternity, did not seem to strike the accomplished 
 homicide. Fleshed in murder, he knew remorse only by 
 name; and, probably, he had small faith, either in his 
 own, or his victim's immortality. 
 
 The gipsy hordes, on their first appearance on the 
 European stage, professed uncommon sanctity, under the 
 assumed character of Christian pilgrims. They affected 
 the Greek worship, but, whether originally, or at any 
 later epoch, they had any intelligible notion of the essen- 
 tial points of our religion, much less, were imbued with 
 its spirit, may reasonably admit of doubt ; at least, it is 
 certain,. the particular race, we have to deal with, at the 
 date of our history, are not to be looked upon, as much 
 differing from confirmed atheists. 
 
 Thus Ragotzy bestrode his prostrate antagonist, with 
 callous indifference, coolly taking the necessary pre-

 However repeatedly the phenomenon of sunrise has 
 been celebrated, in language " married to immortal verse," 
 the topic itself will continue inexhaustible, so long as 
 the lover of Nature delights to contemplate the level 
 planet, slowly uncoiling, like a sparkling serpent, " mid 
 all his cresting clouds and flashing hues," and mark 
 him, trailing floods of glory on his upward path, through 
 the illimitable ether. 
 
 Not many hours had elapsed, after those horrible pas- 
 sages, concluding in the abduction of Veronica, which 
 we have detailed above, when the cock had crown, and 
 the city of Hermanstadt, welled in a golden flood of 
 dewy light, awoke to all the fears and excitement, inci- 
 dent to another to-morrow. To such as uprose to the 
 business of that morrow, duly refreshed and invigorated, 
 by the " oblivious antidote" of the preceding night, there 
 was something genial and soothing to the senses, in the 
 bracing atmosphere, and the clear, cloudless skies, and 
 the voice of birds, thrilling their symphonious matins, 
 and the cool gale, redolent of the milles fieurs, that make 
 up that natural bouquet, which leaves one sense, at least, 
 no reason to regret the '' loss of Eden," but to the thou- 
 sands, and tens of thousands, who, face to face, met that 
 chilly dawn, as it came blushing, above the chimney 
 tops, reeking from the impure, or riotous orgies of the 
 sensual man ; or to the choice few, jaded with their pro- 
 longed hesternal commerce with the Heliconian nymphs, . . 
 unto every one, whose yesterday has no morrow, there 
 was an eloquent contrast, in the freshness of the hour, 
 which sunk, with solemn and silent earnestness, over the 
 heart ; and the sensation of that span of time might an- 
 ticipate an age of riot, revelled out, and thoughts, that

 waste us to our graves, conveying a lesson, beyond the 
 reach of all the homilies and catechisings, ever spoken, 
 or recorded, from Jacob's death-bed, downwards. If 
 ever virtue could hope, of its own strength, to overmaster 
 its spell, it is in the minute, when the young Aurora 
 blushes the day-break from her cheeks. What pity, that 
 minute is so brief! I verily believe, if the genius of 
 our hour-glass would daily, during the access of such 
 soft religious tenderness, hold still his ruthless hand, 
 and cease, were it only " while the Leviathan could swim 
 a league," to measure out his sands, the very operatives 
 of the church would shortly find their profession a sine- 
 cure; and so, in the spirit of the age, be cashiered. Few 
 of our fair readers, we dare say, will understand all 
 this jargon, however our brown ones might have done so 
 " in their hot youth, when George the Third was king." 
 
 But, let us return, where we left the sun, like a pro- 
 digal, showering rays of gold on the roofs and rafters of 
 Hermanstadt, and tipping, with deeper blushes, the kind- 
 ling cheeks of conscious- parting lovers, and heightening 
 the naughty splendour of their eyes, guiltless of a night's 
 rest. By the way, the sun, who is an early riser, must 
 witness some odd scenes now and then, though much, as 
 is best fitting, is left to the imagination. Good love, every 
 body knows, cannot abide day-light ; — but the moon ! — 
 Oh Lord ! tis well for her, she is so chaste, as is given 
 out, or she could never go through the thousandth part 
 of the " indecorums of her witching hour," and then to 
 be put to the blush for so many consecutive nights, 
 unless, indeed, that she be so use by this time to the 
 romance of lovers, that " kissing goes for nothing." Her 
 early quarters, however, must have put her modesty to a 
 severe trial. Now, the sun, though they may receive 
 him differently, " shakes day about,"* impartially, upon

 the poor man's cottage, and the king's palace.* And 
 among other humble domes, which his first equal hori- 
 zontal ray, visited on the morning, following the events 
 just narrated, was that of Hubert; beneath the front 
 abutment of whose domicile, stood, for a second of time, 
 two individuals, inhaling the delicious freshness of the 
 breeze of dawn. We need scarcely say, that neither of 
 these was the hareschina,^ or his daughter : both of whom 
 were absent. The neighbouring convent rung forth a 
 matin peal, that broke the serried armament of mist and 
 vapour overhead, as one of these twain, a female, whose 
 conventual stole of dark serge, snowy capulary, and 
 rosenkranz, or rosary of coral, indicated a sister of the 
 order of charity, sent forth a single quick, and searching 
 glance, beyond the pentice. The other, invitus invitam,X 
 was on the point of dismissing her. Waving her tiny 
 hand to her companion, '' the pensive nun, devout and 
 pure,"^ shot, with the bound of an antelope, a crossing 
 not twenty paces distant, and was out of sight that same 
 instant. The flitting shape seemed to melt away, like 
 the painted iris, in the tender rays of morning; or like 
 the lightning, ** which doth cease to be, ere one can say 
 it lightens." For a moment, the other lingered, and the 
 loose points of his costume fluttered, in the draught of 
 the light morning air, — then turning within, he reclosed 
 the door, and was in the act of passing, through the dusky 
 apartment, when a bright line of light, that slanted 
 through a crevice of the darkened casement, coinciding 
 with a track of blood, along the brick pavement, attracted 
 his eye, and an audible moan, as of one in pain, simul-

 taneously drew his attention. He looked around him, 
 and his visual orb, encountered with difficulty, in the 
 dim half light, that filled every part of the room, ex- 
 cepting where that ray happened to be shot, the ghastly 
 form of the housekeeper, evidently near her end, stretched 
 on the window seat. As quick as thought, he was by her 
 side. 
 
 " Good God ! what means this?" he exclaimed, lean- 
 ing over the expiring form ; '' you bleed !" 
 
 '' I have not an hour to live," was the response, de- 
 livered in feeble accents : '' Yet, your coming gives me 
 hopes, that, with the blessing of God, my murder may 
 yet be avenged." 
 
 " Let me fly for aid," cried Maximilian. 
 
 " 'Tis too late," said the other; " I've staunched my 
 wound myself, — listen to me." She then proceeded to 
 relate the circumstance, which led her to attack Count 
 Ragotzy, and its results. The speaker thus concluded : 
 " They bore off the Lady Veronica, leaving me (for I had 
 swooned away) for dead." 
 
 " Holy Saint Mary! have I then lost the girl, after 
 all?" passionately broke in Maximilian. 
 
 ^' I know not your meaning," resumed the house- 
 keeper ; " after their departure, I would have requested 
 your assistance, had not the door of the room, you slept 
 in, been fastened on the inside. Disappointed of all aid, 
 I crawled hither to die; but say, as thou art a Chris- 
 tian and a knight, wilt thou oblige a dying man?" 
 
 '' Man !" repeated the astonished hearer. 
 
 " Even so, you see before you, that hapless sentry, of 
 whom I spake yesterday." Maximilian recoiled several 
 paces. — " Mark me," exclaimed the bleeding man ; *' if 
 thou aspirest to the hand of the maiden, who lately dwelt 
 beneath this roof, release her father, by tlie means thou 
 hintedst at, when we last conferred." 
 
 ** It shall be effected," replied Maximilian, eagerly.

 mured the dying stranger; " you will be too late. You 
 will find woman's gear, in a recess in the kitchen, as you 
 enter to the right; the which, having assumed, envelope 
 yourself in the loose pelisse, that you will perceive hanging 
 over the pallet." Maximilian was hurrying away, to 
 obey these notable directions, when the other's voice 
 called him back: — "stay," said he, making an effort to 
 rise, which proved abortive; " a strong pull will sever 
 these locks, that tangle down the side of my face." — 
 Maximilian, as directed, removed the disguise. The 
 close brown hair, that was brought to view, had the effect 
 of deducting nearly twenty years, from the apparent age 
 of the assassinated man. " Now, be quick, and decked 
 with these silvery hairs, you will defy detection. Would 
 1 knew his designation, of whom I had them !" Maxi- 
 milian retired to the kitchen, to accommodate his diffi- 
 cult habiliments to his refined taste, in matters of costume. 
 " So," thought our gallant, as he suspended the 
 aprons behind, and in front, a la mode de Wallachia. 
 " I must first liberate the guard captain from prison, and 
 so found a claim to his daughter's everlasting gratitude, 
 and then I can devise what is next to be done, — out 
 upon this skirt. I wish I could arrange it in a more 
 succinct form, about the ancles. So, I see, I must raise 
 
 the opintchens. Doubtless, her father ; there, if I 
 
 have not hit it to a fraction, — will soon discover where 
 
 the rascals have , 'tis a horrid unbecoming cut, this 
 
 pelisse , bestowed her. They cannot, I think, have 
 
 carried her off to any distance ; how coarse, compared 
 
 to the gaba of the magyari ! — and, if I have luck enough 
 to be the knight errant that is fated to , what a con- 
 founded greasy turban ! to rescue her, — faugh ! After 
 
 having freed her father, why I shall have laid my springes 
 so cunningly, that were her heart cased in ribs of ice, the 
 furnace of my sighs would thaw through all, and melt 
 her to my wishes, ('tis well though, she wont have to see 
 me, in these venerable locks), she'll be the daintiest 
 leman in all Erdely. But that poor man will grow im-

 patient. Why such a harlequinade as this is to stand, 
 in stead of a priest, to shrive him, passes my wits; but 
 'tis enough, his fantasy falls in with my own humours." 
 With these ideas passing through his mind, the young 
 graf, having adjusted his bizarre attire to his taste, re- 
 turned to the front apartment, and received directions, 
 from the visibly declining suiferer^ how, in the character 
 of Hubert's domestic, to obtain admittance to his cell. 
 
 "When you see him," said the man; and his voice grew 
 feebler as he spoke, " tell him of the abduction of his 
 daughter; and bid him, on his deliverance, instantly to 
 speed hither, for that I would wish, with my dying breath, 
 to inform him of a matter, that nearly touches him. Yet 
 stay, lest, on his arrival, he find that death hath displaced 
 life, in this poor tenement. I'd better, while I have voice 
 — ;" he hesitated, and then, with inquiring, though glazed 
 eye, added, "Ah! art thou not— didst thou not boast, 
 erewhiles, thou wert — the kinsman of Martinuzzi ?" 
 
 " I have the honour," replied the graf. 
 
 " Then, alas ! I must leave the rest unsaid ; but 
 my breath fails — fly, — and my last benizon for the 
 service." 
 
 Maximilian was already at the door, but there he 
 paused. "If," said he, reverting his head, " the guard- 
 captain ask, who, shall I say, wishes to see him ?" 
 
 For a moment, the other did not answer. " Albert," 
 he, at length, faintly uttered ; "his lost Albert — his 
 brother !" 
 
 "Brother!" responded Maximilian: " knew he that, 
 in that menial garb ?" 
 
 " Never," interrupted Albert of Eissenburg, in a 
 broken tone ; " but haste, or — " 
 
 The dying man sunk back, in the stern expectation of 
 approaching death, which Maximilian left him to con- 
 template ; and another minute, saw our " gallant, gay 
 Lothario," trudging through the still silent street, with 
 the Kosorian under his arm, in the attractive guise of 
 maid-of-all-work, to Hubert, of the guard.

 nous appearance of the walls, was relieved, at intervals, 
 by several paintings in gilded frames, the choice pro- 
 ductions of Ambrogiotto, and other masters of Italy. 
 The inside of three doors, which let into the apartment, 
 were clothed, or rather mantled, with drapery of crim- 
 son velvet, deeply fringed with gold, and looped back, 
 with a massive cord and tassels. The window-hangings, 
 of the same rich fabric, corresponded. The soft, thick, 
 wool covering of the floor, was composed of embroidered 
 foot cloth, of the most perfect workmanship, from the 
 looms, and hands of the maidens of Astrachan. The 
 few couches and chairs, in this apartment, were cush- 
 ionedrwtth damask, and ornamented with needle-work. 
 In a small recess, which constituted the oratory of the 
 cardinal, was disposed a splendid hassock, before a mis- 
 sal and breviary, gorgeously illuminated. In the same 
 niche, beside an ewer of holy water, stood a crucifix, 
 whose burnished gold, wrought with uncommon skill, 
 was inlaid with various precious stones. Seated at 
 the further end of this council-room, on a chair of state, 
 richly embossed, and raised above the rest of the floor, 
 was the cardinal himself,, .but not alone. 
 
 Near him stood a man, whose garb and appearance at- 
 tracted the eyes of Ferraro, and who would seem to 
 deserve from us particular notice. This person was ap- 
 parently past the meridian of life, and his scarred fea- 
 tures, and set martial air, were indicative of his profession. 
 His personal equipments enabled Ferraro to ascertain the 
 capacity, in which he served. He was a member of that 
 formidable troop, which had lately been organised, by 
 the regent of Hungary, for the purposes of national de- 
 fence. The emperor himself had set the example of the 
 institution of a body of mercenaries, in lieu of the pre- 
 carious service of feudal levies, and Martinuzzi's sagacity 
 early discerned the many advantages, that would accrue 
 to Hungary, from the adoption of a similar measure. 
 The man, now closeted witli tlie cardinal, wore the

 habit of a subaltern officer of the national troop. His 
 Herculean frame appeared modelled on purpose, to sup- 
 port the ponderous hauberk, gorget, arm-pieces, and 
 gauntlets of bright steel, that protected his person. A 
 massive iron cassinet, crested with a plume of horse-hair, 
 which he at present held in his hand, commonly weighed 
 upon his temples, and, rivetting closely to the ears and 
 head, fastened under the chin. A long, two-handed 
 spear, was suspended, from his neck, in a baldric : a 
 dagger, or dirk, hung at his right side. Although the 
 generic cast, superinduced upon the natural disposition, 
 by his professional pursuits, was so strongly stamped on 
 the man's physiognomy, his countenance, likewise, ac- 
 knowledged a distinct, and marked expression, which was 
 neither so defined, nor, perhaps, altogether so honour- 
 able to his character. The small, grey eyes, almost 
 hidden, from the uncommon depth, at which they were 
 set, in the head, and by the projection of the thick, 
 grizzled eyebrows, were not perfectly in keeping, with 
 his martial front ; neither did their language accord, 
 with so much of the contour of his other features, as the 
 rivettings, and clashings of the morion, aloug the sides 
 of his visage, usually permitted to be seen. There ob- 
 viously lurked a cunning, and sinister purpose, in the 
 quick, inquisitive glance, which, at intervals, he would 
 cast abroad from the deep recess, immediately over the 
 projecting cheek-bone, and which appeared still more 
 equivocal, when he would turn his light eye back on it- 
 self, as if to inquire of his subtle spirit its latent ima- 
 ginings, when, as it were, his mind would hold commune 
 with its own intimations, and '^ thick coming fancies." 
 Even after a more close observation of his face, little 
 of principle, judicious conduct, or ordinary prudence, 
 could be traced in its deep, and distorted lines. He 
 looked a man, who, in the words of the prophet, was not 
 even " wise to do evil, and to do good he had no know- 
 ledge." A wavering of purpose, an instability of tern-

 per, an aptitude to yield to sudden impulse, without 
 adequate motive, might, perhaps, be read in his unsteady 
 gaze, and in the anxious, though subdued, expression of 
 his contracted brow. It is likely, a skilful disciple of 
 Lavater might pronounce him rather a weak, than a 
 wicked man, and there was, undoubtedly, a deal of na- 
 tural benevolence conspicuous, in the lower, and subor- 
 dinate lineaments of his face, which corrected, in a great 
 measure, or rather contradicted, the subtlety, and, per- 
 haps, we might add, the ferocity of his other features. 
 He appeared, at first sight, to exceed the middle period 
 of life, for his locks were chequered, by a few grizzled 
 hairs; but more accurate observation, might be inclined 
 to attribute the dust of silver, shed upon his brow, to the 
 persecuting hand of inauspicious sorrow, rather than to 
 the operation of age. 
 
 These minute points of physiognomy, and martial gar- 
 niture, it is likely, would have escaped the notice of the 
 dispirited young secretary, but there appeared, as Fer- 
 raro entered the apartment, something so equivocal, in 
 the attitude of the soldier, that he could not help feeling 
 a degree of wonder, at witnessing so incongruous, how- 
 ever picturesque, an exhibition, in that residence, and in 
 such a presence. The man stood by the side of the 
 regent's chair; his one foot was advanced forwards; 
 his left hand, in which he held his morion, lay against 
 his breast, but his right arm was stretched forth, with 
 his forefinger, pointing, earnestly, towards the opposite 
 wall. 
 
 The observation of Ferraro, however, quickly became 
 transferred, from the finger of the subaltern, to be ri- 
 vetted on the spectacle of Martinuzzi himself. The dress 
 of the cardinal was an episcopal cope, whose crimson 
 magnificence, and embroidered folds, assimilated well, 
 with the dignity of his cliaracter, and suited his rank and 
 lofty bearing. However, on the present occasion, liis 
 accustomed carriage seemed to have vanished ; his man-

 ner, and aspect, exhibited a confusion, almost amount- 
 ing* to dismay. Chill beads of perspiration stood on his 
 forehead ; the unnatural wanness of his cheeks bewrayed 
 the trembling of his heart. His lips were severed, and 
 the deaf would have supposed, he was speaking, though 
 he uttered not a word. His bloodshot eyes glimmered 
 frightfully : his one hand busied itself, in an uncertain 
 manner, in adjusting his scarlet hat, which was crushed 
 by the compressure, and several of the long strings lay 
 strewn about the carpet. His other hand, where the 
 overfraught veins showed, like hard blue cords, through 
 the transparent skin, that glowed, as liquid fire, had, in 
 nervous irritation, unconsciously torn open the embroi- 
 dered vestment beneath his ermine, and even the close 
 shirt of haircloth, he wore next his skin, had been 
 dragged aside, by his restless fingers, leaving his manly 
 breast exposed to view. 
 
 Ferraro was astonished, beyond measure, that any 
 causes, however powerful, could operate so strongly, 
 on the nerves, and temperament of Marlinuzzi, as to cause 
 that air of discomposure. What he then beheld, pre- 
 sented altogether so very different an appearance, from 
 the regent's usual aspect, that, by no stretch of the ima- 
 gination, could he reconcile the contradiction. Could 
 it be true, that one, whose tempered thoughts were re- 
 ported to be serene and calm, as some inland lake, when 
 not the smallest breath stirs its clear bosom, and whose 
 feeling, Ferraro had always supposed, harmonized solely to 
 " that peace of mind which passes all understanding," — 
 could a man, really thus tempered, let the intensity of 
 his emotions convulse his frame, so fearfully, and his 
 mere human passions boil over like the streams of Hecla ? 
 
 Such an exhibition would seem alike incompatible 
 with Martinuzzi's ordinary reserve, as a statesman, and a 
 scholar, — with his dignified self-respect, as a prelate, — and 
 his habitual, and chastened self-possession, as a Christian, 
 and a man. Ferraro could hardly credit the information

 of his own eyes, and as he glanced from the dignitary 
 to the soldier, who so audaciously confronted him, he 
 grew each moment, more and more, bewildered with 
 astonishment, while Martinuzzi was so painfully absorbed 
 by his inward, and indescribable emotions, as to be un- 
 conscious, for above a minute, of the intrusion of the 
 secretary ; but, on looking up, and perceiving who was 
 present, with a strong mental exertion, like that of a man 
 struggling for life, he suppressed the further exhibition of 
 his feelings. As if in his own absolute despite, and in 
 very defiance of his exhaustion, he almost instantly suc- 
 ceeded, in rallying his conflicting thoughts, and arose to 
 receive Ferraro. His countenance meanwhile, although 
 it still retained its native melancholy character, grew 
 more composed, and became divested of that horrified ex- 
 pression, which Mark Antoine had remarked, on entering: 
 " My friend," he said, addressing himself to his armed 
 companion, " I will thank you to retire for awhile, into 
 that inner room ; when I shall be again at leisure, we will 
 talk further," Close the door. — Even as he spoke, the 
 other turned towards the opposite door, to which Marti- 
 nuzzi motioned with his hand, and disappearing, left 
 Ferraro alone, w^ith the prelate. 
 
 As the door closed upon the subaltern, Martinuzzi 
 advanced forward a few paces, to welcome his visitor, 
 who threw himself on one knee before him. Grasping him 
 firmly by the hand, as he assisted him to rise, the regent 
 cried — ^' Welcome, worthy sir, I would not call this hand 
 mine enemy, for the best jewel in king Ferdinand's crown. 
 To you, and to your royal master, peace ! What's to be 
 done, before we part ?" 
 
 '* Your eminence will please to bear in mind," replied 
 Ferraro, " that the words, 1 am necessitated to deliver, 
 are those of my sovereign, although the voice is the voice 
 of the humble individual before you." 
 
 " And welcome as before," returned Martinuzzi, with a

 benign smile, which, however, the next moment darkened- 
 into sternness — " Neither Mark Antoine de Ferraro, nor 
 the Emperor of Germany can, I am convinced, say, or 
 demand aught unworthy of us." He paused, looking 
 fixedly in the face of the envoy; " and for thyself," he 
 proceeded, " the grandson of my ancient friend, Jerome 
 Lascus, albeit thou knowest not how entirely, thou dost 
 command my very heart, and wilt, doubtless, keep mine 
 honour, bright and unsullied, as thine own must be." 
 Martinuzzi ceased, as if waiting for a reply, and regarded 
 Ferraro, with that look of mingled pride, and courtesy, 
 which his noble features could so well express. 
 
 The secretary of Piadena, spoke not. 
 
 The preliminary address of the regent tended to con- 
 fuse the young ambassador, and greatly increased his re- 
 pugnance to the business in hand, — he could not prevail 
 upon himself, at once to deliver the message of his king. 
 It cut him to the soul to reflect, that the generous, and 
 trusting courtesy of Martinuzzi, was about to receive so 
 shameful a requital. He remained, therefore, with his 
 eyes fixed on the ground, and the marks of no slight 
 embarrassment were visible, on his countenance. 
 
 The urbanity of the regent would not let him appear to 
 observe Ferraro's hesitation, and presently he again spoke: 
 '^ By your leave, my dear sir, we'll hear your communi- 
 cation anon, and in the interim," he continued, advanc- 
 ing to the casement, which he threw open, " let us admit 
 the gentle gladsome breeze partaker of our counsels." 
 As Martinuzzi leant, for a moment, on the open window 
 frame, his cheek paled, even to the hue of death. A 
 sensation of debility seemed to overpower him; he pressed 
 his hand upon his heart, from whose depths a sigh ex- 
 pired, so emphatic, as almost to amount to a groan. 
 
 *' My lord, my dear lord, you're faint," exclaimed 
 Ferraro. 
 
 The regent smiled languidly, whilst the previous wan-

 ness of his clieek was succeeded, by that treacherous 
 blood-flush, which was a faint reflex of those latent fires, 
 which consumed him — 
 
 " In his cheek 
 
 And lips, a flush of gnawing fire did find. 
 Their food and dwelling."*" 
 
 It was, as if the quenchless soul fretted, at its mortal 
 coil, blazing out only the more fiercely, for that state of de- 
 bility, which was its aliment. 
 
 •* The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break." t 
 
 " Not SO, Antoine ; not so now," answered Martinuzzi, 
 after a pause, "■ the calm autumnal air, doth bear a balm 
 to my brow, harassed, and lacking the healing dews of 
 slumber, and doth stir, and quicken the flagging spirit, 
 which, in sooth, repose, this by-gone night, hath not re- 
 newed. I will recover instantly." He paused, and the 
 expression of life shot again into his features, with the 
 vividness of sunshine. '' So, so, 'tis over now: and how 
 is Austria?" he presently subjoined, in a freer tone, '' in 
 
 health? I hope, — I trust ." There was something in 
 
 the strong mental, and physical command over himself, 
 that displayed itself, in the beaming visage, and attitude 
 of Martinuzzi, at that moment, which Ferraro felt to be 
 deeply impresive. Immediately he made answer. 
 
 •' The archduke is well, would, I could report the 
 same of your eminence! Pardon me, you are too lavish 
 of your precious strength. Why suffer you the light of 
 Hungary to dwindle thus? Your highness is to blame. 
 Thou shouldstnot task the nimble, and the silent hours of 
 dark, and tire them with your service, but seek the gilded 
 emptiness of the blessed sleep, or else devote the wanton 
 time to festivals, and banquets, where the flushed throng 
 weave the expressive ugros,X and the air resounds, with 
 the varied music, elanced from warbling voices. Why 
 not, my lord?"

 ''Ay, music, indeed!" repeated Martinuzzi, with a 
 sigh; "yet, wherefore swell the song in vain? I have 
 read, how, the bards of the olden age invested joy, with 
 a superfluous harmony, and would accord no magic 
 strain, to assuage the fierce pangs of dissolution, or the 
 worse bitterness of undying grief."* 
 
 *' Then, if not in such oblivious happiness," rejoined 
 Ferraro; "why not a lingering on Lais' lap, abandon 
 the rosy opportunity to deep delight ?t 'Tis the sin of 
 the world, or legends lie," and Ferraro smiled. 
 
 " Well, my dear sir," observed Martinuzzi, in a quiet 
 tone, and with a grave and melancholy smile; " if I in- 
 terpret your thought aright, I am more content to be thus 
 weary, than to be so delighted. To graft virtue upon 
 pleasure, Antoine, were to poison its excellence at the 
 source. "I Martinuzzi sighed, and was lost, for a mo- 
 ment, in painful abstraction; then, seeming to recol- 
 lect himself, he took a single turn across the apartment,

 ere he added, with an air of dignity, as if with a view 
 to change the topic: " But, in sooth, I think, you did 
 not teach me how to serve you. Have you not some 
 mission from your court, that I should liear ? Pro- 
 ceed with it, gentle sir." The young secretary started, in 
 his turn, and breathed hard for an instant ; he gazed on 
 the Gothic niche, that canopied the chair of state ; he 
 threw his glances upward, and downward, and around; 
 his eye thrice wandered, from the fretted roof, to the or- 
 namented footcloth; it at last alighted on Martinuzzi, 
 and met his penetrating and inquiring look, and then 
 Ferraro, summoning up all his presence of mind, thus, 
 in an embarrassed voice, opened the subject of his com- 
 munication. 
 
 " Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, King of Bohemia, 
 
 of Hungary, of Halitz, and of Lodomeria ." The 
 
 cardinal broke in, with an air of surprise, 
 
 '' Not of Hungary, Ferraro," he cried, in a deep and 
 measured voice; " nor of Halitz, nor of Lodomeria."* 
 
 " Pardon me, good my lord," said the envoy ; " sends 
 greetings to George Martinuzzi, Lord Cardinal, Lord 
 Archbishop of Strigonie, Lord Bishop of Waradin, and 
 Lord Regent of the province of Transylvania; and, out of 
 his great friendship and esteem, invests him with regal 
 power and dignity in Transylvania, to hold the same as 
 feudatory of the Austrian crown, for the term of his na- 
 tural life, the right of inheritance to vest in the lord pa- 
 ramount, the Archduke Ferdinand, upon the demise of 
 George Martinuzzi." The cardinal listened to the de- 
 livery of this extraordinary errand, without so much as 
 moving a muscle of his face, or winking an eyelid; a

 slight cloud, indeed, passed over his marble brow, but 
 when Ferraro had concluded, the evanescent hectic 
 slowly vanished, and (like the faint hues of fading day, 
 withdrawn from some miraculous chiselling of " the 
 human face divine," — perchance the choicest of beautiful 
 things inanimate), showed his countenance more marble 
 than before. Meanwhile, the clear visage of the youth- 
 ful envoy, reciprocating the cardinal's transitory emotion, 
 was suffused with the deepest crimson, and bent to the 
 ground. 
 
 " Take back our answer to the Archduke Ferdinand," 
 began the cardinal, with the most touching grace and 
 dignity of manner, and in a tone of voice, which had to 
 Ferraro's ears, he knew not what effect of awe, and ma- 
 jesty; " and give him to know from the Lord Regent of 
 Hungary, that not for the imperial crown he aims at, or 
 his brother's triple diadem, or the wealth of Moutezume 
 to boot, would George Martinuzzi " 
 
 What should have followed, was on the lip of the re- 
 gent, when his speech was stopped short, by the projec- 
 tion of a human head, deeply shaded by the overhanging 
 cowl, through the opening door. It was Father Domi- 
 nick, who, for an instant, stood in the door-way, and 
 then, with measured tread, walked up to the regent, and 
 delivered a scroll of paper, into his hands. Whatever 
 thoughts possessed his bosom, he stood by the side of 
 Martinuzzi, motionless as a statue, with his head re- 
 posing on his chest, and his arms folded in deference. 
 
 Ferraro had only beheld the confessor, on one memo- 
 rable occasion ; but he knew, by the leaden crucifix at 
 his girdle, that the figure could be no other, than that of 
 Father Dominick, and a thrill of unpleasant surprise 
 crept through his veins. 
 
 Martinuzzi ran his eye rapidly, yet with earnest at- 
 tention, over the paper; his countenance lowered; he 
 looked, for a while, fixedly on the monk. Presently, 
 he seemed about to speak, but paused, and regarded

 MANUSCRIPT XVI. 125 
 
 Ferraro, with a searching glance. Then, again, after 
 being wrapped for several moments in deep reflections, 
 he fell to a second perusal of the paper, and remained 
 gazing thereon, without word or motion. At length, he 
 turned to Father Dominick, who still retained the same 
 fixed, and composed attitude, he had first assumed. 
 " Pray you a word," he said, and, laying his hand on 
 the sleeve of his mysterious confessor, Martinuzzi drew 
 him deep into the apartment. The two spoke together, 
 in inaudible whispers. 
 
 Ferraro watched, with wonder and curiosity, the change 
 in the countenance of the regent, and the extraordinary 
 conduct of the holy father. They continued to converse 
 together, for several minutes, but at such a distance, as 
 to place them out of earshot, and, although the young 
 secretary caught a word, at intervals, from the lips of 
 Martinuzzi, it was too unconnected and indefinite, to 
 enable him to arrive at the nature of the conference. 
 After a while, the speakers advanced forward, and Fa- 
 ther Dominick was about to retire, when the deep tones of 
 Martinuzzi's voice fell, full and distinct, upon Ferraro's 
 ear. '' Yes," he said, ^' the state shall still lie sheltered,* 
 under the broad imperial tree I planted, and did nourish 
 with the sweat of mine own forehead, although I mav 
 not hope to dream beneath its shadow. Thou k newest 
 I have done this, and suffer it, solely for the well-beino- 
 of,. . my country." 
 
 There followed a pause, of one or two minutes, after 
 Father Dominick had withdrawn, during which, Mar- 
 tinuzzi stood, with a hesitating, and perplexed air, as if 
 endeavouring painfully, and with difficulty, to temper his 
 rebellious will, and tutor his stubborn tongue, to a tone 
 of thinking, and language more subdued than before, but 
 also more accoidant with his altered purpose. There-

 fore, no indication of his secret feelings could be got at, 
 while, in a severe, and deep-toned voice, the regent ad- 
 dressed the young envoy. '^ Mark Antoine Ferraro," 
 he said, " since what time has your master held his im- 
 perial crown, in defiance of the international law of 
 Germany, and of Europe ? Since what time, I wish to 
 learn, has he deemed, that strong power, like a pent- 
 house, screens him from public opinion ?" And Mar- 
 tinuzzi would have fixed his glance, on the countenance 
 of Ferraro, but the secretary eluded the scrutiny, by 
 bending his eyes to the ground. 
 
 Some pretence was muttered of the alliance of Ferdi- 
 nand with Anne of Hungary, in 1515, and, likewise, of 
 the engagement of King John, before his marriage,* that 
 that kingdom should be restored to the race of Ladislaus, 
 upon his death. Then Ferraro added, more boldly, 
 though still in a faltering tone, " Would you deign to 
 point out any act of the emporor, to which your in- 
 quiry were apposite, my answer might possibly be more 
 to your highness's satisfaction." 
 
 " I allude, sir, to the formidable attitude, which the 
 archduke has assumed, by riding these dominions with 
 arrayed banner. I am here instructed, by my confessor, 
 that the pennons of Austria now float on the walls of 
 Alba Julia, t and, moreover, that the city of Coloswar is 
 beleaguered, trenches already opened, and other works 
 begun. What does this mean ? The two kingdoms are 
 at peace, — no war proclaimed ; — is't not so ? or have 
 I all along misunderstood the Marquis of Piadena ? 
 Nay, we are, sure, at peace, else the embassy from the 
 court of Vienna were not now in Hermanstadt. Ere 
 now, I have been warned by certain of my court, but 
 would not lend an ear to aught, so derogatory to the

 honour of Ferdinand.* I own, I am at fault : can you 
 help me ? or prithee explain, my dear sir ?" 
 
 '' The Archduke of Austria was apprehensive," replied 
 Ferraro, with no small confusion, " that the enemies of 
 your eminence, those factious chiefs, whose licentious 
 perfidy, and endless series of conspiracies have dis- 
 graced, for centuries, the registers of Hungary, who 
 claim the right to choose the object, the measure, and 
 the term of their allegiance, might, unless a sufficient 
 force were in the field, to overawe their movements, 
 make the occasion of the demission of the royal authority 
 of her grace, an apology to perplex your council, and 
 so plunge the province into confusion." 
 
 *' Oh ! I see — I have to thank the archduke, truly, 
 for his consideration," replied Martinuzzi, with bitter 
 sarcasm ; " then it is for our humble service, — it is on 
 our poor account, that the Austrian army now invests 
 Coloswar, and bivouacs, on these cold nights, in the woods 
 of Transylvania. Verily, we are highly obliged ; but 
 am I given to understand, that every attempt at insur- 
 rection, in right of the Queen of Hungary, is to be re- 
 sisted, and possibly suppressed, by the arms of Ferdi- 
 nand ? — is THAT the reading ?" 
 
 " The Archduke of Austria trusts that disaffection 
 may not arrive at that height, which would require his 
 interference," answered Ferraro. 
 
 " But if it turn out contrary to your royal master's 
 expectations, it is, as I state?" persisted Martinuzzi. 
 
 " Even so," replied Ferraro. 
 
 " And, without any regard to the inclinations of the 
 people, whosoever heads the army of our queen is to be 
 deemed a rebel ?" demanded the regent. 
 
 " In the instructions of my sovereign, I find no ex- 
 ception," said the ambassador.

 " Ha! consider better — not one?" demanded Mar- 
 tinuzzi — " not the Lord Regent of Hungary ?" 
 
 Ferraro bowed. 
 
 Martinuzzi saw his advantage, and at once took a 
 higher tone of argument. " And does the Emperor of 
 Germany flatter himself," he proceeded, with fervent 
 voice, and an impassioned majesty, " that Europe will 
 suffer this ? My surprisal involves the immortal infamy 
 of Ferdinand ; — 'tis rank, 'tis foul, sir. The archduke 
 in league, and no war proclaimed ? It was not in the 
 competency of a man of honour to apprehend the invasion 
 of this territory, considering the amicable correspondence 
 of the two courts. How far, however, the artifice and 
 chicane of Austria will eventually advantage him, I need 
 no sybil to inform me. The arguments, which your

 month, in the louder tone of the Ottoman cannon. 
 Perchance, sir," he added, with tempered energy, whilst 
 the brightest animation appeared in all his frame, and 
 his eye sparkled, with the triumphant retribution, his soul 
 anticipated, — " Perchance, the banners, that now wave 
 defiance, from their ensign-staff, on the topmost towers of 
 Gyula-feir-var,* may shake, in the stern blast, that lours 
 in the east, — perchance, sir, the leaves of the old thorn, 
 that fluctuate at their side, will outlive their grandeur, 
 and, one of these days, whisper, in the whirlwind's ear, 
 the tale of Austria's humiliation. We live in changeful 
 times. Marc Antoine." Martinuzzi ceased ; he seemed 
 to hesitate, but shortly added : '' After what you have 
 declared of Ferdinand's determination, and remembering

 the dishonourable advantage, he has obtained over us, 
 we must needs bear with the overwhelming power, that 
 cannot be resisted. Call some few days back, and well 
 the emperor knoweth — " Again, Martinuzzi paused, 
 compressed his lips forcibly together, as if to save his 
 breath, to pronounce the final, and irreversible declara- 
 tion. At last, " Tell the ambassador of Austria," he 
 cried, and his voice slightly trembled, " that he may 
 write to his sovereign, and say, that George Martinuzzi 
 will condescend to accept the crown of Transylvania !" 
 
 Ferraro started. Although circumstances had, almost 
 begun to persuade him, that such would be the issue 
 of his conference, still, to hear the avowal of the regent's 
 dishonour, from his own lips, visibly shocked the sen- 
 sitive young gentleman. 
 
 Perhaps the whole wide world, of wretched casual- 
 ties, presents no incidence more affecting, than, thus, 
 being made an accomplice, so to speak, in the humili- 
 ation of an honoured friend. The more exalted our 
 previous conceptions of his character, so much the more 
 sensibly, do we feel the utter shock of his downfall 
 and disgrace. It is painful to blush for one, whom, in 
 our pure credulity, we had fondly gifted, with all the 
 qualities, that dignify humanity. It is mortifying to be- 
 hold our idol, disrobed of his imagined excellence, but 
 it is doubly repellent and mortifying, if he, to whose su- 
 periority we had fondly clung, happen to stand before 
 us, an eye witness of our shame, and sorrow, at Ijis 
 debasement. There is a magnetic sympathy, between 
 ourselves and him. We avert our gaze, and would fain 
 give the lie, to the expression of our countenance, but 
 honest nature will, commonly, prevail, though the 
 features be cased in the triple felt of liypocrisy. 
 
 *' Scipio, my sable friend, by heavens! thou coun- 
 
 selledst well," thought Ferraro to himself, in the hushed 
 
 interval, which succeeded the last words of Martinuzzi. 
 
 There was a dead silence between them, for a while,

 elapsing- in mutual, and conscious embarrassment. At 
 length it was dispelled, by the young envoy, who, with 
 frigid formality, observed ; — 
 
 " I will lay before the Marquis of Piadena, those pas- 
 sages, which have just passed between us, touching your 
 eminence's acceptance of King Ferdinand's proposals. 
 How shall I state, your eminence purposes to dispose 
 of — " here the tones of Ferraro's voice trembled, and 
 almost failed him — "the Lady Czerina?" he added; 
 and a thrill passed over him, as the title issued from 
 his mouth, slowly and deliberately. 
 
 "Purposes to dispose of ! " repeated Martinuzzi, and 
 his eye lightened with indignation ; — " to dispose of! I 
 understand you not, sir. The personal effects, and 
 allodial estates, of the house of Zapola, she may, surely, 
 be permitted to retain ?" 
 
 "Your pardon," said Ferraro, "I would ask, where 
 it is intended, her grace take up her abode?" 
 
 " Would the Archduke of Austria object, that the 
 capital of our dominions be graced, by the presence of 
 the lady, you speak of, if we ourselves afford her our 
 countenance and protection?" demanded Martinuzzi, 
 in the tones of haughty irony. 
 
 "Perhaps it were dangerous," returned Ferraro ; " her 
 
 grace is deservedly popular, and however I will submit 
 
 your eminence's disposition, to the lord paramount, and 
 ascertain his wishes." 
 
 Martinuzzi's eyes flashed indignant scorn, and he 
 smiled disdainfully, as he observed ; " Sir. I am poor 
 dust, it seems, before the whirlwind of the absolute will 
 of Ferdinand: well, so be it." 
 
 "And when," asked Ferraro, "shall I say, it will 
 be the pleasure of your eminence to be crowned ?" This 
 inquiry was delivered, in a doubtful voice, the speaker 
 not venturing, in mercy to the cardinal's feelings, to 
 look him in the face, apprehensive of having his glance 
 misinterpreted, and construed into an insult.

 Martinuzzi was silent. 
 
 Ferraro again addressed him: ''The crown of Hun- 
 gary, men say, was wrought by angels, and is the gift 
 of angels. The people, as your highness knows, are 
 attached to visible symbols, that are of miraculous effi- 
 cacy,* nor will they ever acknowledge you, as their law- 
 ful sovereign, unless they behold, upon your head, that 
 diadem, which has been consecrated by ancient use, and 
 rendered holy by its heavenly origin. When shall Tran- 
 sylvania rejoice, in your highness's coronation ?" 
 
 ''What time the last corps of the imperial guard, 
 shall have recrossed the frontiers," replied the regent, 
 with appalling sternness; " or else, when not one living 
 Spaniard, or Austrian, which composes it, darkens my 
 native land." 
 
 The revealings of Ferraro's soul shone out, as lie 
 raised his eyes from the floor, and gazed, with that in- 
 expressible look, which Heaven had assigned him, upon 
 the noble countenance of Martinuzzi ; for his own feel- 
 ings responded to his peremptory language, and again, 
 he thought he recognised the inflexible spirit of tlie 
 high-hearted statesman. He reflected, however, deeply, 
 for a minute, ere he hazarded a reply. 
 
 " I cannot, without further instructions from the mar- 
 quis, presume to dictate to your eminence, nor v.'ould I, 
 willingly, stand committed, in this respect," said Fer- 
 raro. " I was prepared, 1 believed, for every contin- 
 gency, but I find myself mistaken : your mounting the 
 throne of Transylvania, did neither, I rather think, enter 
 into the archduke's calculation, nor his ambassador's, 
 nor," he paused, as if unwilling to \\*ound the feelings 
 of Martinuzzi, and yet irresistibly impelled to give vent

 to his sentiments, ere he added, almost with bitterness; 
 " nor, could it^ into that of Piadena's secretary." 
 
 No sooner had he uttered these words, than he re- 
 pented his rashness, and his mind reproached him, for 
 descending to insinuate a reproach. In this transition 
 ef sentiment, the blood rushed back from his cheeks, 
 and he turned away his face ; but he underwent no slight 
 surprise, when Martinuzzi, almost instantly, retorted, 
 with a peculiar inflection of tone, which seemed to con- 
 tain the most cutting sarcasm : — 
 
 ''I judged as much; but it was for your master to 
 have computed chances and consequences, ere he com- 
 mitted his honour so inextricably." 
 
 There followed a momentary pause. " I suppose, you 
 are aware, sir," rejoined the regent, in a voice, which 
 subsided from its previous cool, sarcastic tone, into one 
 of stern but passionless composure; "that, according to 
 ancient custom, the states of Transylvania can only be 
 convoked at Coloswar, which now is encompassed, on all 
 sides, by the imperial troops. Sir, when your royal sen- 
 der shall see cause to raise the siege of that city, our 
 coronation will be open to us. When Transylvania is 
 free, we will be crov/ned ; meanwhile we rule, as hereto- 
 fore — ' The crosier is an easy sceptre.' "* 
 
 The greater part of the remaining colloquy passed 
 over, with manifest constraint on both sides, and, after a 
 few more moments of desultory discourse, Ferraro was 
 on the point of taking his departure, when Martinuzzi 
 took him by the hand, and addressed him in a style, al- 
 together different; " Marc Antoine," he said, in a tone, 
 the courtesy of which might almost be deemed affec- 
 tionate, " let there be no coldness between us — you have 
 done your duty, as became you. Your character is not 
 unknown to me, and it would gratify me, in a sense, 
 which the customary forms of speech are feeble to ex-

 sometimes, barter with us a few brief syllables, which may 
 embody thoughts, for the rumination of after years ? — 
 Come hither, often — the oftener the more welcome ! — 
 you consent. Accept my thanks ; but you will not for- 
 get. There, farewell, and — ." The regent paused, and 
 then, dismissing the young secretary, subjoined, with 
 considerable solemnity, '' act an upright and a straight- 
 forward part. Marc Antoine, and you may find yourself, 
 even beyond your hopes, successful, in what lies nearest 
 your heart ; go, now, and God bless you !" Martinuzzi 
 waved his hand, and Ferraro withdrew, in pleased sur- 
 prise, and respectful silence.

 Ferraro had scarcely issued from the citadel, when there 
 sounded a loud voice along the vestibule, adjoining Mar- 
 tinuzzi's chamber. " What, ho ! — who waits ?" They 
 were the words of the regent. Several knights and men- 
 at-arms stepped forth. Martinuzzi approached one of 
 these, and conferred with him apart, for above a minute. 
 '* Use all speed herein, Bathori," he concluded ; " and if 
 Abu Obeida be not at his own abode, track him, from 
 street to street, from house to house, till you hunt him 
 down, and then invite him hither; — you hear me?" 
 
 " I will, your eminence," replied Bathori. 
 
 *' Right, — flag not now— spare not your breath now. 1 
 impose upon you this duty, because I know your zeal. 
 Away ! Do you, Nicholas Zrinii, hasten to the several 
 barriers, and bring me intelligence, whether any person 
 called Ragotzy, so the man's name was inscribed on his 
 safe conduct, have passed lately. Can any here inform 
 me, respecting a tall chevalier, at present on a visit to 
 our most holy friend and confessor. Father Dominick ?" 
 
 ** May it please your eminence, I have noted such a 
 person," answered one of the serjeants-at-arms. 
 
 '' Have that man arrested in my name," said the re-

 gent ; '< and some of you inquire of the gate-warden, if 
 he have left the citadel since morn." 
 
 The attendant departed on his errand : — the door 
 of the vestibule was ajar, and the officers, who were 
 there on duty, could observe the regent, standing, 
 in a musing attitude, in the midst of the council- 
 chamber. Presently a person, plainly dressed, in the 
 garb of a courier, hastily entered the vestibule ; his heat 
 and broken breathing, no less than his travel-soiled, and 
 disordered vestments, seemed to announce that he had 
 ridden hard, and had just alighted from a far journey. 
 "Where is his eminence?" he hurriedly demanded of 
 those about him. The retainers looked in the direction 
 of the council-room, and the regent, having caught the 
 inquiry, beckoned the courier to advance. 
 
 "Your tidings!" exclaimed Martinuzzi, with an al- 
 most breathless eagerness of tone, and manner. 
 " i have none whatsoever," answered the man. 
 The regent clasped his hands, and raised his eyes, over- 
 whelmed, as it seemed, with disappointment. " You 
 failed not to publish a description of Swartz's person to 
 the authorities, at Buda ?'' 
 
 " I did so, my lord," replied the courier, — " and like- 
 wise atPresburg?" — " I obeyed the commands of your emi- 
 nence in all respects," answered the man. 
 
 " You may go," said Martinuzzi. The courier was 
 about to leave the chamber, when the regent again 
 spoke, — "Another word." The man stopped short — 
 *' You entered the city by the road of St. Agatha? — 
 was it not so?" The courier expressed his assent. " How 
 goes the world, sir ? — you traversed a distracted land," 
 said Martinuzzi. 
 
 "Alas! my lord, all is terror and confusion,— the 
 neighbouring plains are scoured by troops of horse — 
 Coloswar is besieged." 
 
 " Did they suffer you to proceed on your route, through 
 Alba Julia, unmolested?" interrogated the cardinal.

 *' I made a considerable detour, to avoid the risk of 
 detention," was the reply. 
 
 *' It was wisely thought of," observed the regent. 
 " You did not happen to hear, how many may be on 
 their way, or the number of those now encamped, before 
 Coloswar?" 
 
 " 1 understood, at Presburg, the imperial force had 
 been computed at forty thousand men ; but, on the 
 marches, the accounts vary considerably, some estimates 
 hardly falling short of twice that amount." 
 
 There ensued another pause, when again the dignified 
 examinator proceeded — " What army of reserve is 
 there at Presburg, or absent in the neighbourhood on 
 furlough?" 
 
 " None, that I heard of," was the reply. 
 
 Martinuzzi paced the small extent of the chamber, as 
 if ruminating on the items of information, he had ga- 
 thered. His eye kindled, for an instant, with a look of 
 unusual fire, and there was an uncommon glow, in his 
 kingly countenance. *' Though," he murm.ured aloud, — 
 " he dig like moles, Ferdinand may yet find his train of 
 treachery undermined." Suddenly he halted. ''Enough, 
 my friend," he cried, and the courier took his departure. 
 
 " Now, you are well returned : what says the guard ?" 
 he demanded, turning to another officer, who, on the 
 courier's dismissal, came forwards ! 
 
 " Please your eminence," thus he made his report, — 
 " the castle guard was only relieved half an hour gone 
 by, since when no mailed chevalier has passed beyond 
 the citadel." 
 
 " Tush !" ejaculated Martinuzzi ; but the peevish nvo- 
 nosyllable escaped him in so low a tone, as to be nearly 
 inaudible. " Has not Bathori come back ere this ?" 
 
 " 1 apprehend, not, your highness," answered the 
 man-at-arms. 
 
 "The slug! — yet wherefore so?" he murmured to 
 himself. " 'Tis my own heart, the swiftness of whose

 thought, so gallops and outstrips the tardy minutes, — but 
 I can wait no longer. Bid the baron, when he returns, 
 remain in the vestibule, till I have leisure to speak with 
 him. Say I am particularly engaged the while; — none 
 of you quit your posts, and — and — ," the regent paused, 
 ''and, touching Abu Obeida," he presently resumed, 
 " if he come in the meantime, you will usher him, into 
 this apartment, — will you not ?" As he spoke thus inco- 
 herently, his visage worked, while the tone of his voice, 
 and his whole manner, underwent a marked, and extraor- 
 dinary change ; presently he turned aside his head, as if 
 to hide the expression of indescribable horror, that over- 
 spread his countenance. 
 
 " Your highness !" exclaimed the man-at-arms. 
 Martinuzzi gazed on the speaker — it was a wild look, 
 almost painful to encounter, as if, on the sudden, his 
 very intellects tottered on their seat, and he was vainly 
 labouring, to fix the wandering energies of his mind, on 
 some point of immediate interest, which yet, for the in- 
 stant, escaped his apprehension. '' Oh, certainly, 'tis 
 as I determine," said the regent, at length ; combining 
 so strange an obliquity of language, with that unwonted 
 incoherence of manner, which we have described above : 
 " Well, then, not here, not here, — do you understand ? 
 Good God !" and the voice of Martinuzzi heightened, 
 and shook with emotion. " As you value your lives, not 
 into this room yet," he continued, more collectedly ; but, 
 as if communing with himself, " Abu Obeida, should 
 not be left in the vestibule — how then ? Ha ! that 
 will be better — Hark ye, — demean yourselves to the 
 Emir with deference, and let him be shown, into the 
 blue chamber, — that of Father Dominick, — do ye under- 
 stand ? — until we require his presence." 
 
 •' Of Father Domiriick, your highness ?" echoed several 
 voices, in deep toned and horrified chorus. 
 
 ** Let me hear no more of this; I am not apt for't, nor 
 care to repeat my words," said the regent angrily. " Be

 the watch doubled to-night. One of you, order out the 
 city guard, before the citadel. See to it instantly." — 
 '* Ha!" he replied, in answer to one of his serjeants-at- 
 arms — " Ha! by the western barrier, and so lately, say 
 you? You are satisfied, the safe conduct was that of 
 Ragotzy." 
 
 '' That was the name, your highness," replied the man. 
 
 The regent motioned his hand to his forehead, with an 
 impulse of vexation, but the action was hardly percep- 
 tible, and as transient as it was slight, " that to the mind 
 'twas but a doubt." " Hie thee now," he said, address- 
 ing the officer, who had last spoken ; " to our well beloved 
 commander, Valentinian, CountTurascus, — here are your 
 credentials; tell him, that, for state reasons, which we hold 
 back for his private ear, it is our wish, that every man in 
 the Hungarian army be under arms, by midnight, — bid 
 him, moreover, forthwith send a herald-at-arms, through 
 Transylvania, holding aloft the bloody glaive, according to 
 old usage.* Be this the war-cry to our absent Magnats —

 in his family. Whence, says Bonfinius, the introduction into Hungary

 The obligation of the freemen in the dark ages, to perform military ser-

 become landed proprietors, in the countries, which they or their ancestors 
 had subdued, so that, they had at once, to guard against the hostility of 
 the ancient inhabitants, and to take care, that in their turn, they were not 
 dispossessed by fresh colonies of barbarians. The most rigorous penalty 
 exacted of those, who disregarded this tacit compact, seems to have been 
 that we have now under review. According: to the milder law of the

 The officer left the vestibule. 
 
 *' And now, gentlemen," said Martinuzzi, turning to 
 the rest, " be sure my orders be well looked to, and 
 literally, as I have spoken — your heads shall answer." 
 The men-at-arms, making a signal of obedience, fell 
 back, and the regent, retiring within the precincts of 
 his private apartment, closed the door after him. 
 
 He closed the door : he took several strides, across the 
 room, and an extraordinary alteration was apparent in 
 his mien, and conduct. His countenance underwent a 
 frightful change, — he stood beside the oratory, for a 
 passing instant, and then knelt down before the crucifix, 
 and prayed aloud, in an exhausted and faint voice. " O 
 clemens! O pie! vere passum immolatum in cruce, os- 
 tende mihi tuam misericordiam in hac hora." He arose; 
 large drops of perspiration bedewed his forehead; the 
 light of command, and the light of genius had left his 
 eyes, — -all expression, save that of terror and disgust, had 
 deserted his wan features; he stood a moment, with both 
 hands clasped firmly, over his eyes; his gorgeous cope 
 fell, unregarded, from his shoulder; his head stooped

 down, and, we will not say, whether one single drop (un- 
 wonted relief), wrung, from the very depth of agony, 
 might not have trickled between his long waxen fingers. 
 The jesses of his heart, as if tagged at, by ten thousand 
 unreclaimed falcons, seemed to rive his very frame asun- 
 der, and so he stood, gathering from the strange intensity 
 of his emotions, a sort of inspiration. Presently, with 
 wavering step he crossed the chamber, — he hesitated, 
 and then laid his hand, upon the lock of the door, which 
 opened into a sort of anti-room, whither the mailed sol- 
 dier had withdrawn, on the entrance of Ferraro, as men- 
 tioned in the last chapter. Martinuzzi paused, for a few 
 seconds, to nerve himself for the encounter; his face was 
 of a marbly whiteness, — his eyes grew dim and dimmer, 
 and as his hand removed its hold from the door, he slowly 
 sunk down, on a seat beside him. Shortly, he again rose, 
 pacing the apartment for above a minute, with a rapid 
 step ; he slackened it, and halted at the further door, 
 which issued into the suite of rooms, appropriated to 
 Father Dominick; thrice he turned the key, and having 
 carefully shot the bolt, he closed around the velvet cur- 
 tain, as if to afford an additional barrier. " Pereny 
 would not," murmured Martinuzzi to himself; " but lest 
 Abu Obeida, in his absence, — 'twere better — ." The re- 
 gent broke off, and then passed leisurely to the door, 
 which opened to the vestibule. Each footstep owned a 
 feeling, and he glided stealthily, over the carpet, as if he 
 feared to awaken the echoes, that lurked in the old 
 wainscoting, or to attract the notice of the sombre por- 
 traits, whose ghastly eyes, in the deepening gloom, 
 seemed to flare on him, with an unnatural, and portent- 
 ous gleam. Having barricaded and secured this door, 
 with similar vigilance and precaution, a second time he 
 sought the entrance to the anti-room. Apparently, 
 however, extracting a sort of courage, from liis very 
 dread, he opened the door, which creaked mournfully on 
 its hinges, and passing forward, the lord regent of Hun-

 gary enclosed himself, within the privacy of the inner 
 apartment. 
 
 Meantime, the retainers, who waited without the door, 
 made their several comments, on what was going forward. 
 The perturbed and impatient manner of Martinuzzi, ex- 
 cited their astonishment, — the sudden calling out of the 
 national troop, gave rise to innumerable speculations ; 
 but all minor circumstances were soon swallowed up, in 
 the remembrance of the impossible orders, they had re- 
 ceived, — to break in on the privacy of Father Dominick; 
 on him, whom most of those present devoutly believed to 
 be the incarnate enemy of man. To usher Abu Obeida, 
 without previous word or notice, into his chamber, — pos- 
 sibly into his presence! was ever such temerity? All 
 insisted on shifting the office, upon some of their fellow 
 servitors, but each individual grew faint at the proposition. 
 Whilst the matter was yet sub litu, the rushing of foot- 
 steps towards the vestibule, challenged attention, and 
 the warder of the castle, with every symptom of dismay 
 and horror, depicted on his countenance, burst amongst 
 the already excited group, demanding to speak with the 
 regent. He was apprised of Martinuzzi's commands, that 
 he was not to be disturbed. 
 
 "Why, what's in the wind, now, man?" asked one 
 of those present. 
 
 " Enough, in all conscience," replied the jailor. 
 
 " Tell us, then, have you seen a ghost?" 
 
 " Often; but what I have to acquaint his eminence 
 with, is more astounding by half." 
 
 " Indeed!" said a man-at-arms, tipping the wink to his 
 fellows; " come let us hear what has chanced?" 
 
 " I know no reason why you should not," returned 
 the jailor; " hearken then. You remember, some years 
 gone by, the noise, that was occasioned, by the myste- 
 rious disappearance of that poor sentinel, — who had been 
 before wiled from his post, by the spectre of the preci-

 pice, as he gave out, and wliose carcase was afterwards 
 discovered, beneath the southern rampart?" 
 
 '^ To be sure we do," exclaimed all in abreath, closing 
 round the narrator. 
 
 ''Well, I was not warder at the time; I was just a 
 sort of helper, as one may say ; but my predecessor, hav- 
 ing his office taken from him, though it was no fault of 
 his, you know;" and he turned an inquiring eye round 
 the circle, as if to demand their accordance, in a propo- 
 sition, which to him appeared so self-evident. 
 
 " None whatever," the most of them replied, being 
 the required response to his eloquent appeal ; " but 
 go on." 
 
 " Well, as the saints ordained, I was promoted into 
 the luckless fellow's shoes, being appointed head jailor ; 
 and such, as you all know, has been my honourable 
 charge, down to the present hour, though that it will be 
 so in the next, is more than I dare vouch for." 
 
 " How so? What have you been about?" 
 
 "You shall hear. In the first joy of my new ap- 
 pointment, I vowed a vow unto our Lady Mary, Now, 
 can any of you give a guess, masters, what ihat vow 
 was ?" 
 
 " Why, to be pitiful to your charges, I should not 
 v/onder," observed one of the retainers. 
 
 ■' No, that was not it ; I vowed to the blessed Mary, 
 I would never, as long as I lived to be warden, lock 
 up any prisoner in that cell, from which the devil, or his 
 agent," — and here the man cast a significant look at 
 the door of Father Dominick's chamber — '* conveyed 
 away that sentry. Such, you must know, was the solemn 
 vow I vowed, and, till the other day, I faithfully kept my 
 pledge." 
 
 "And what the deuce made you break it at last?" 
 demanded one of his listeners. 
 
 " Why the prison has been so crowded of late, that

 every other solitary ward, but that identical chamber, 
 became occupied ; and not long ago, in the very middle 
 of the night, ere I could provide for his accommodation, 
 I was suddenly called upon, to take charge of a new man, 
 just laid under arrest." 
 
 "Well, you did not confine him in the prohibited 
 ward, I suppose?" 
 
 " Ay, but I did ; the vow I vowed to the blessed Vir- 
 gin, I forgot at a pinch, and a precious turn she has 
 served me in consequence. In that diabolical dungeon, 
 for several days and nights, I safely secured Hubert, of 
 the night guard." 
 
 " Was it he ?" 
 
 " Ay, did I not tell you so ?" 
 
 ** Not before ; but FU swear it was no other ; there was 
 always something mysterious, and reserved about that 
 man. Has he too been conveyed away ?" 
 
 " That's it, by the holy Mary ! He is off." 
 
 " What ! from that cell ? I ever had my suspicions of 
 him. Has he left no trace behind ?" 
 
 *' Not he, damn him ! but he has left his bail ; we 
 have a substitute." 
 
 " A substitute ! How ? the devil ?" 
 
 " No, not the Mano, exactly ; though, mayhap, it 's 
 much the same." 
 
 " Who then ?" 
 
 *'The Count Maximilian Pereny." 
 
 " The Graf Pereny !" repeated all around. 
 
 ** Ay, as I despair to be forgiven, not a quarter of an 
 hour since, when I passed into the ward in question, with 
 provisions for my prisoner, in lieu of Hubert, whom I, as 
 usual, expected to see, to my knock-down amazement, 
 there sat his countship at his ease, in a corner of the 
 dungeon." 
 
 *' Why, how did he get in ?" demanded his auditors, 
 in a breath.

 " On the horns of Beelzebub, I believe," responded 
 the warder. 
 
 *' And where is the Graf Pereny now?" asked some of 
 the men-at-arms. 
 
 " Here, you rascals !" exclaimed a voice at an outer 
 entrance of the lobby, and the important personage in 
 question, swung the door, on its hinges.

 the reader's satisfaction. We must leave, therefore, the 
 Graf Pereny, bullying, and ordering about him, in the 
 ante-room of Martinuzzi, to usher the reader, at the same 
 hour, within an elegant saloon, in the contiguous palace 
 of Queen Isabella, where, indolently reclining upon an 
 ottoman, he may observe Abu Obeida, who had lately 
 arrived, in the capital of Transylvania, charged with a 
 special mission, from the sultan.

 The Moslem envoy was a tall, slender man, of pale 
 complexion. The members of his face were minute, with 
 the exception of his nose, which owned the true aquiline 
 curve. His neck exceeded in length, and he might be 
 apparently about sixty years of age ; but time, though 
 tasked to the uttermost, nor toil, his familiar, had tamed 
 down the fiery lustre of the Ottoman's dark, wild eye, or 
 chastened its bold, and haughty expression, or tempered 
 the war-worn, and almost ferocious character of his ge- 
 neral physiognomy. The amplitude of his attire was 
 characteristic of his race. The long, loose pelisse of green 
 cloth, with its free, graceful folds, and lining of costliest 
 sable ; the snowy trowsers, or shaksheers, hanging loose 
 about the legs, like a sack ; the vest, sewn on each side 
 in regular rows, with large and valuable pearls ; the 
 Cashmerian shawl, in the form of a girdle, through which 
 projected the hilt and pummel of a hangier, or dagger, 
 mounted with precious stones ; the slippers, of yellow 
 morocco leather; but, more particularly, the recherche, 
 turban, whose green colour was an infallible token of the 
 true blood of the wearer, and " whose restless front," 
 surmounted by a flowing plume, bore a ruby of inestimable 
 price,, .all indicated the classic costume of the East. 
 
 From these minutise, it was easy to infer, that the 
 personage in question could be no other, than one of the 
 grand pachas of the Ottoman court ; but, ere the eyes of 
 the reader can be supposed to have acquainted him with 
 the fact, his attention must be called off to a different, if 
 not to a more fascinating personage, for a near footstep 
 is heard, — the arras gently undulates, — it is drawn aside, 
 and Queen Isabella, magnificently arrayed, according to 
 her rank, sweeps into the apartment. Then Abu Obeida 
 arose, and made his obeisance, with more than oriental 
 obsequiousness, bending his eyes upon the ground, and 
 holding his right hand motionless on his heart.*

 " We perceive, by the missives, you bear from the he- 
 roic sultan," began the lady, *' that he considers you, 
 sir, completely embued with a sense of his interests and 
 wishes, in regard to the important, and interesting nego- 
 tiation, to which those missives relate." 
 
 ** Your grace will pardon the boast," answered Abu 
 Obeida, " but^ the humblest of his slaves, even I my- 
 self, am, in this respect, — the mental shadow, the lock and 
 key, of the inmost soul of him, who is lord and arbiter 
 of all, that the sun irradiates and vivifies; by whom I 
 am commissioned, ere I ventured on the interesting sub- 
 ject we are presently to consider, to entreat your grace's 
 acceptance of a most ancient relic of one Roman, whose 
 works, he is given to understand, most learned Franks 
 hold in high odour." And, with these words, the emir 
 handed to the queen a plain silver pen, on which these 
 characters were inscribed — Ovidii Nasonis Calamus. * 
 
 " Ha !" returned Isabella, with an air of interest, as, 
 after due acknowledgments, she gracefully accepted the 
 simple token, '' a memorial of Ovid ! — doubtless, with 
 this little instrument, were bodied forth those exquisite 
 strains from Medea to Jason, f which, with no ineloquent 
 or feeble scholarship, I have heard a valued friend, some 
 time translate, for my delight, into harmonious numbers. 
 I am myself no linguist, but I have been taught to love 
 Ovid." Isabella sighed, and, as she sighed, she turned 
 her head away, and a tear fell on the pen. Almost in- 
 stantly recovering herself, she subjoined, in her usual 
 
 ^ * The above is, according to Ciofanius, who says, " Isabella Panno-

 quae est urbs inferioris Pannoniae, ostendit Petro Angelio Jiargaeo, qui 
 hoc ipsum mihi nairavit, cum ha;c inscriptione : Ovidii Nustmis Cala-

 repertus. Eum regina ipsa plurimi faciebat et velut rem sacrum curem 
 habebat."

 soft voice, " I knew the poet had been an exile in our 
 land, and, if I recollect rightly, his place of sepulture 
 was discovered, not very long ago, at Stein-am-Anger, 
 the ancient Sabaria, in Lower Hungary ; and yet so 
 long," she added, with a smile, " that I must have been 
 an infant at the time : but tell me, how came this pre- 
 cious relic, in the possession of your honoured master?" 
 
 " It was found, a few years since, under some ruins 
 in the neighbourhood of Belgrade,* and brought to So- 
 lyman," replied Abu Obeida. 
 
 " I will not easily part with it," said Isabella, pressing 
 the pen to her lip. " You smile, gracious sir, but, 
 though Heaven acknowledges but one religion, earth 
 owns many superstitions, the truest of which is, that of 
 poetry, and it claims to have its proper saints and re- 
 lics. I fear we may not long keep company, but, be- 
 lieve me, while I have life, I will wear, next my heart, 
 this bit of silver, as I would a charm. Alexander, we 
 are told, appropriated the perfumed casket of Darius to 
 the reception of the Iliad ; but there can be but one meet 
 reliquary for the pen of Ovid," and Isabella put it in her 
 bosom. There was a momentary silence. " We find," 
 presently resumed the lady, having recovered her com- 
 posure, '^ that you are instructed and empowered to 
 act in the sultan's name, throughout our negotiation, 
 with the like decision and unerring faith, as if thou thy- 
 self wert he, with whom the engagements are entered 
 into." 
 
 " Your tablets will inform you," replied the Turk, 
 *' that, whatsoever terms I subscribe, the invincible king 
 of kings has sworn, in the holy name of Alia, to ra- 
 tify."

 " Enough," said the queen ; " the word of Solyman, 
 issues from his lips, as free from aught, that would 
 breathe a shadow on its brightness, as that blade of 
 Damascus, he knows so well to wield, springs from its 
 jewelled sheath. As to your imperial master, then, I 
 address myself." 
 
 Abu Obeida bowed low.. 
 
 Isabella hesitated for an instant. Then, abruptly 
 stepping close to where Abu Obeida stood, again spoke, 
 in that low, deep tone of voice, indicative of a fiery na- 
 ture, reined in by powerful motives of self control, and 
 with an air and gesture strikingly significant, she said, 
 " Before we discuss the interesting topic, which we pro- 
 pose in our present commune, I would inquire, whether 
 this be your only business in Hermanstadt. Have you 
 no private intelligence with Him ? — hey, sir ?" 
 
 " With whom mean you, lady ?" asked Abu Obeida. 
 
 " Thou art very wily, or very dull, man," returned 
 
 Isabella; ^' why, with that priest, that traitor, that , 
 
 sure you understand me now !" 
 
 " Not I, your highness," replied the Mussulman. 
 
 " By the bones of my buried ancestry I" exclaimed 
 the queen, with some heat, " thou frett'st me." She 
 paused a moment, in deep agitation, and then added, 
 in an ebullition of bitter feeling, which only long-stifled 
 hatred, breaking forth into expression, could exhibit — 
 " Martinuzzi, sir, — (why do you torture me?), — the 
 Lord Regent of Hungary and Transylvania, . . the king ! 
 since you will have his titles in full. — Pah! pah! my 
 lips are blistered ! — Oh ! you apprehend me now ?" and 
 a bitter smile betrayed the acuteness of her emotion. 
 '' The infamy steams in the general breath, and every 
 child in Hermanstadt can tell you who is Kiral, tekintetes

 tion with that — how weak are words to speak him to

 the height ! — that boil of state ? Answer me, as thou 
 wert Solyman, who stood there ; ha !" 
 
 Abu Obeida instantly replied, '* None private, your 
 highness. I am, indeed, commissioned by despatches, 
 received within the last hour, to protest against the 
 Transylvanian fortresses falling into the hands of King 
 Ferdinand, but such is public matter, and has no con- 
 nection with the pending negotiation, betwixt yourself 
 and the sultan." 
 
 " Tis well, sir ; and that man is still ignorant of my 
 present determination, (certain stipulations being con- 
 ceded,) to bestow the Queen of Hungary on Solyman ?" 
 
 " His highness, I should imagine, can have no sus- 
 picion of your purpose," returned Abu Obeida. 
 
 " Oh ! you know him not !" exclaimed Isabella, " nor 
 guess, how subtler than the fox his nature is ; only God, 
 sir, knows what mines he has shaped in the bowels of the 
 earth; but, with this train, I trust to blow into the air 
 the fabric of his ambition. Yet tell me, I have always 
 understood, that, for the last two centuries, since what 
 time the Tartars outraged your sultana,, .the wife of — 
 Tlderim, was he not called ? — you know whom I mean, — 
 him surnamed of the Lightning?" 
 
 " Bajazet, your grace," said Abu Obeida. 
 
 " Ay, surely, Bajazet," rejoined Isabella. " Has it 
 not been subsequently the invariable rule of the Sublime 
 Porte, to admit none but slaves to the sultan's bed ? — 
 How may this difficulty of the Ottoman pride, or policy, 
 be evaded ?" 
 
 " My sovereign master," said the envoy; " will disre- 
 gard that maxim, and espouse your daughter, as his 
 sole and lawful Kadeun, partly in consideration of the 
 honour of the alliance, but chiefly out of his regard for 
 the lady, and admiration of her charms." 
 
 " Nay, no laboured hyperboles, sir," said Isabella; 
 " we Franks have little taste for oriental flowers. The 
 child is well enough, but she is merely a child, and were it

 not to rescue her, from the insidious policy of that man, 
 and for other reasons, which are private to me, it were as 
 well, that she had more experience, ere she undertook the 
 duties and responsibilities of a wife. Some three summers 
 hence, with all the soul of her ancestors strong within 
 her, she would seem a meeter spouse for the mighty 
 Solyman. But, alas! in that space of time, what might 
 not sceptered tyranny, and withering selfishness practise 
 upon her? Me, sir, the relict of King John, of him, who 
 first raised that godless man into a world's wonder; me, 
 the ingrate has despoiled of state and power, and left a 
 cypher, in the dominions of my husband. He is the 
 coffin of my greatness ; and will he spare the daughter,think 
 you, after treading down the mother's honours, as they 
 were writ in sand, and scattering the dust before the 
 whirlwind of his tyranny? No, sir, the queen of Hun- 
 gary's health, her freedom, her very life, may be com- 
 promised, if, ere it be too late, she do not secure the pro- 
 tection of some potent ally, and I know none so powerful, 
 as Solyman. These, and other reasons, have induced me 
 to wave all minor objections, and to embrace the pro- 
 posal of your sultan." 
 
 " Whatever the cause, the result will constitute his 
 happiness," observed Abu Obeida, breaking in as soon as 
 Isabella paused; " mashallah! praise be to God! But 
 will you be pleased to recapitulate those preliminary 
 articles of our agreement, which, if I understand aright, 
 it is indispensable, at the hands of Solyman, should be 
 conceded." 
 
 ** The grand point, sir," said Isabella, " is, of course, 
 that my daughter enjoy the free exercise of her own reli- 
 gion ; next, that the eldest child be educated in its mother's 
 faith, and acknowledged the heir of Hungary, in bar of 
 the claim of Ferdinand, the souzerainfe of the sultan 
 himself, or the preposterous usurpation of Martinuzzi." 
 
 " These are hard and dangerous stipulations," replied 
 Abu Obeida; " but to what would not Solyman accede, if

 thereby he might make the divine Czerina, the partner 
 of his throne. But may I remind your grace, there was 
 one condition, more peculiarly relating to your highness, 
 which I should hope will not be insisted upon." 
 
 *' The queen of Hungary's advantage herein, is what 
 certainly lies deepest at our heart," replied Isabella, 
 gravely; '' yet, even so, I can imagine nothing, better 
 calculated to secure her interests, and those of her pos- 
 terity, than the article you refer to. No, sir, be it un- 
 derstood, not one jot can we abate of our demands, 
 consistently with our duty. The sultan must engage to 
 make us the sole Waivode of Erdely for life, and to obtain, 
 by persuasion or force, the deposition of that man, or no 
 daughter of Hungary shall, with our consent, ascend the 
 throne of Turkey." Abu Obeida paused, and hesitated 
 for a short space, ere he made answer. 
 
 " That particular may scarce consist with the honour 
 of Solyman: setting aside political considerations, his 
 highness stands pledged to Martinuzzi, both as ally and 
 friend. May lentreat your grace to wave so unreason- 
 able a proposition?" 
 
 *' It is impossible, sir," rejoined Isabella; " the cardi- 
 nal's fall has been my favourite object for the last twelve 
 months. You know not that man, nor can conceive, 
 what I have been made to suffer, at his hands. (High 
 Heaven ! the thought of it racks me) ! The claims to 
 majesty, my husband left me, he has trodden ; like a name 
 in sand, to nothing. But I am resolved on retribution; 
 for retribution have I schemed, watched, and prayed this 
 many a day ; and now, that your master's policy might 
 minister to my revenge, think you, I will forego it! No, 
 by the Lord above, will I not! Either the hydra crest of 
 Martinuzzi quails its glory, or 'tis no treaty." Isabella 
 ceased, and paced the chamber, for a minute, with hasty 
 and troubled tread. Then, suddenly stopping near, 
 where the moslem envoy stood, silent, and with his dark 
 eyes fixed on the floor, the queen added; "We have

 possessed you with our secret hopes ; only be wise, only 
 bring this matter to bear, and tax our bounty as you will, 
 you cannot over-rate the gratitude of a royal queen, or 
 estimate too highly, an injured woman's vengeance." 
 Abu Obeida bowed. " These provinces, sir," presently 
 resumed Isabella; ^' have forfeited estates in store, and 
 their soil, remember is golden.* The havings of royalty, 
 though drained, are far from exhausted ; thou canst not 
 devise a gift, but I will, " she paused, looked earn- 
 estly in the countenance of the envoy, but presently sub- 
 joined, in the softest tone imaginable, " My good friend, 
 perhaps, will name his terms?" Abu Obeida again bowed, 
 and in a few words, delivered modestly, but firmly, de- 
 clined, with such thanks as courtesy dictated, the prof- 
 fered liberality; assuring Isabella, that his sincere desire 
 to carry forward the treaty to a successful issue, could not 
 be increased by any contingent advantage, which might 
 thereby accrue to himself. 
 
 " Disinterested man!" exclaimed Isabella, and her 
 eyes beamed triple sunshine, as she spoke; '* how I envy 
 Solyman the possession of such a subject, — of such a 
 friend I be it, as your incorruptible nature wills. At 
 least, however," she added, " oblige me so far, as to 
 accept this token of an unhappy lady, who is, I would 
 say, who was, the queen of Hungary." Saying these 
 words, Isabella produced a golden cup, inlaid with dia- 
 monds, the lid of which was surmounted by a clock, 
 that indicated, not only the time of day, but also the

 march sublime of the celestial bodies.* With a warm 
 smile, she delivered the same to the Turk, who received 
 it, with great demonstrations of thankfulness, and after 
 gazing on it for an instant, with much appearance of 
 amazement, and kissing it, Abu Obeida answered, 
 
 " This will serve to remind me, noble lady, (bending 
 reverently to the queen), of thy gracious condescension 
 to one, who (under reservation of his allegiance to his 
 lord and master), is the humblest and most devoted of thy 
 grace's servants." 
 
 To this courteous declaration, Isabella was on the 
 point of making a suitable reply, when quick steps, and 
 the war of jarring voices, in the ante-chamber, inter- 
 rupted their conversation. The altercation, which we 
 mention, had been, for some time, conducted in a lower 
 key, but now first became audible. 
 
 ** I tell you 1 must have entrance !" exclaimed one of 
 the interlocutors, in a raised and peremptory tone, " so 
 stay me at your peril." 
 
 '' Ha! who are you, say must, in this habitation? — 
 Back with you, unmannered lord !" 
 
 " Nay, then, slave, my sword must do my message," 
 hotly returned the first speaker. 
 
 " How ! wouldst draw, i' the queen's palace ?" 
 
 "Ay, stand back, knave, for, wer't in a church, I 
 must obey orders, persisted the other." There followed a 
 brief scuffle ; one of the twain was heard to fall heavily 
 to the earth, and almost instantly, the arras was flung 
 aside, and the Baron Bathori, who, in his ireful mood, 
 had borne down the opposition of the seneschal, burst 
 into the presence of the queen dowager, and the Turkish 
 envoy. On perceiving whither his precipitance had hur- 
 ried him, the intruder drew back. He might have a

 foretaste, identical in kind, though limited in degree, of 
 the bitterness attendant on that revulsion of feeling, 
 v^hich, probably, overwhelms the soul of the suicide, 
 on finding himself thrust, instantaneously, by his own 
 act, on a scene of splendour, too dazzling to be con- 
 templated. 
 
 At a short distance from the door, stood the stately 
 Mussulman, having one foot rather advanced, whilst 
 his long neck, thrown back, looked like the polished 
 shaft to the capital it upheld. His dark eyes flashed 
 on the noble that indignation, and surprise, which he 
 did not suffer his voice to prolate. Nearer still, Isa- 
 bella, drawing her person up to its full height, whilst 
 her ample crimson robe seemed, as it were, to spread 
 out, in yet prouder folds, as her bosom swelled beneath, 
 with alternate scorn and anger, planted herself, as 
 if to barricade the privacy of her chamber, from un- 
 hallowed intrusion. She also fixed her eyes, with a 
 keen and stern regard, upon Bathori, who, cap in 
 hand, remained near the door, apparently deprived, 
 in his bewilderment of surprise, of all power of utter- 
 ance. The pellucid brow of Isabella gave tokens of 
 gathering passion ; her eyes struck fire, as, in a voice, 
 wliich trembled with that agitation, which she yet felt, it 
 would derogate from her dignity to manifest, she said — 
 " How's this, unscrupulous knave ? — knows't thou in 
 whose house thou now art — in whose presence thou 
 stand'st, that thou comest upon us thus unceremoni- 
 ously?" 
 
 To this inquiry, Isabella received, at first, no intelligi- 
 ble reply ; for Bathori's confusion was so great, that 
 words came not at his will, and it required an effort of 
 self-command, merely to falter out, *'The regent's orders, 
 gracious madam !" 
 
 " His orders, indeed ! — unmannered varlet ! What 
 leave hath he, or any subject, to order you, sir, to press 
 on our retirement ? But, by the soul of my liusband !

 this shall be answered. — What, ho! within there!'* and 
 thus speaking, Isabella hurriedly, but with stately step, 
 passed from the room through one adjoining it ; when, 
 instantly, her voice was heard, still louder and sterner 
 than before : " Who waits, I say ? — close all the doors : 
 foul mischief has here been done !" Immediately, many 
 retainers hurried into the apartment. " Apprehend that 
 person," said Isabella, with a dark and angry frown, 
 pointing to Bathori ; " he has slain to death, I fear, my 
 favourite usher, who would have kept him from us. See, 
 and some of ye disarm the traitor." 
 
 The senseless body was forthwith carried off, and, for 
 long, baffled every effort to recover him, so effectually 
 had the blow, which laid him prostrate, done its office. 
 Whether from apprehension of the consequences of his 
 heat and rashness, or else owing to the reaction of his 
 audacity, in having, unwittingly, forced himself upon the 
 retirement of the queen, or more probably from a mixed 
 feeling of consternation, at his double danger, the facul- 
 ties of the baron were so wrought upon, that it was only, 
 as he was being taken away in custody, that he recovered 
 from his bewilderment. 
 
 " I have, at least, a duty to execute in respect to your 
 excellence," he said, addressing Abu Obeida ; " the re-

 whose eye already kindled into impatience, " may I ask, 
 madam, whither I am to be conducted ?" 
 ^' To prison, sir," said Isabella, haughtily. 
 "Upon what pretence, your highness?" demanded 
 the baron. 
 
 '^ Wouldst parley with us ? — why, for riot in the royal 
 palace, and your attempt on the life of our servitor," re- 
 plied Isabella, with warmth, 
 
 " In respect to the former accusation," returned Ba- 
 thori, '' I had the express commands of his eminence.

 obstacles in the way of my duty. As to the latter charge, 
 
 I can truly say " 
 
 A rich rush of blood flooded the countenance of Isa^ 
 bella. *' You hear," she exclaimed, breaking in upon 
 his explanations, and her luscious lip curled with excess 
 of scorn and bitterness : "You hear,., as I thought, the 
 cardinal, as usual, is at the bottom of these insults." 
 
 " Your grace," said Bathori, " puts a hasty con- 
 struction on my words, — I never meant to intimate 
 that." 
 
 "We will have no talk bandied with us, sirrah," said 
 Isabella, again interrupting him, " Remove your pri- 
 soner, and see he be forthcoming, at lawful demand. 
 We would willingly try the strength and integrity of the 
 palace-confines. Those of the castle are in bad repute ; 
 but if any caitiff escape our ward, the jailor had best 
 look to his own :" and, in obedience to these orders, 
 the baron was withdrawn from the chamber. 
 
 Nothing further, that deserves mention, occurred in 
 the course of that interview, between Isabella and the 
 Turkish envoy. Neither seemed willing to readvert to 
 the delicate matter of their interrupted colloquy, and, 
 shortly afterwards, Abu Obeida, having consigned the 
 gift of the queen to the care of an attendant, with a 
 profound obeisance, took his leave. 
 
 As we have already, in a previous chapter, expati- 
 ated rather at large, on the character and fortunes of 
 Isabella, we need not here do our readers the unkind- 
 ness to recapitulate. We believe, we partly explained 
 the anomalous rank she held, and the constrained posi- 
 tion, in the state, which she occupied, owing to the 
 arbitrary proceedings of Martinuzzi. He not only pros- 
 trated his Titan foe to the lowest depth, but chained 
 her there, like another Typhosus, by the superincum- 
 bent weight of his dominion. Besides that the pecu-

 liarly haughty temperament of Isabella, writhed be- 
 neath those causes of irritation, there concurred certain 
 circumstances, about this period, to exasperate her al- 
 ready inflamed, and corrosive bitterness, into a trans- 
 port of mind, bordering upon madness. 
 
 The warm, and perfectly unselfish feeling of maternity, 
 so universally builds itself a nest, in the breast of woman, 
 that it is commonly deemed an innate property of her 
 being. Nevertheless, some rare examples, which blacken 
 the pages of biography, would seem to contravene this 
 notion. Instances are on record, of mothers holding in 
 detestation their own offspring. We would not, how- 
 ever, insinuate that Isabella was ever exactly, a monster 
 of this description. *' She did not," to borrow a turn 
 of thought and expression, so peculiar, that its author 
 cannot be mistaken, " refuse to become the mother of"* 
 our heroine ; but, during her early years, she scarcely 
 ventured, even to her own thoughts, to analyze, and con- 
 fess, that feeling of aversion, which lay at their core. 
 It was towards the opening of our tale, that her senti- 
 ments assumed a more active, and distinctive character, — 
 the tender instincts of a mother, withered beneath the 
 upas of revenge, which a singular concurrence of cir- 
 cumstances engendered, in the rank soil of her heart. 
 Under the bitter alchemy of a single prepossession, Isa- 
 bella's whole nature became transmuted, till that anti- 
 pathy, which had long brooded, or lain torpid, at the 
 bottom of her soul, effervesced, and overflowed, in a 
 strong tide of intolerable abhorrence. 
 
 Alas, for woman! who can love but once, — whose 
 heart, sense, soul, become concentrated upon a single 
 object, and who, when all she thinks, hopes, braves, 
 curdles into despair, will yet doat on, in very madness 
 of abandonment. Alas, for woman ! whose susceptibility 
 is her curse, — whose angelic nature becomes her re-

 proach, — whose constancy makes her ruin ; her best 
 trust is chance, and her only hope is apathy. If she 
 come to yield but one jot, to the infantile, but omni- 
 potent divinity, let her tremble ! For her, there is there- 
 after, no retreat, — her heart-sigh is an earthquake, for 
 evermore, and, thenceforth, she dwells on a volcano. 
 Alas, for woman ! — and unto man, eternal shame ! who 
 can cast the livery of his heart, with as much facility, — 
 ay, and in as brief an interval, — as the viper his slough ; 
 and, imbibing a new passion, as he'd don a new suit, 
 will disregard his love of yesterday, as he might a gar- 
 ment overworn. And who, I ask, when the sweetness of 
 her nature is turned to gall, and those soft emotions, 
 which assimilated her unto angels, are devoted to liber- 
 tinage, or whipped into the bitter wrath of jealousy, and 
 the insanity of revenge, — who shall presume to arraign 
 woman of the consequences ? Not man, — cruel, heartless, 
 hypocritical, exacting man ! — whose self-centred and in- 
 grossing passions, are their origin and first cause : — not 
 man, who lies, and fawns, and wriggles himself into 
 woman's affections, and whose love, whether it prove 
 true or false, is almost equally her bane. Oh ! let her, 
 when she yield to the tempter, make up her mind, for 
 tyranny or desertion : — 
 
 " Gh for that warning voice, which he who saw 
 The Apocalypse, heard cry in heaven aloud !" * 
 
 Maidens ! who, yet zoned in purity and peace, walk 
 the green sod of earth, with clear spirit, and elastic step, 
 start back, when your bosoms heave their first sigh, in 
 token of reciprocating passion ! — fly, I tell ye, fly, as 
 the startled African, on his arid shore, darts off, on hear- 
 ing the summons of his hunter. The musket-shot, and 
 the bosom-throb, are alike granted, as the warning of 
 the coming evil,.. both are meant for an omen, and a 
 death peal : fly ye, like him, from slavery !

 did not, during her maidenhood, nor indeed for several 
 years, subsequent to the death of John of Zapola, happen 
 to fall in with an individual, whom she deemed worthy to 
 occupy "that craving void left aching at the breast." At 
 length, on a fatal day for himself, and the happiness of 
 others, ('' accursed, and in a cursed hour,"t) the youthful 
 secretary of the Marquis of Piadena, arrived in Herman- 
 stadt, and presenting himself and his credentials at the 
 palace, cast the lot of the future life of Isabella.

 and nearly miraculous sympathy between the sexes, 
 which, in common parlance, is styled *' love at first sight." 
 That such things have been, we will not take upon us to 
 deny ; they ought, however, we rather think, to be deem- 
 ed exceptions to the ordinary regulations of Cytherea in 
 this regard ; and, for our own part, if ever we are to be 
 subjected to the inevitable shafts of her golden bow,* 
 whether in the active or passive voice, we hope (" for 
 certain unknown reasons") to be classed under the general 
 rule. However this may turn out, we are bound to tell 
 this present story as we find it; and we read, that Isa- 
 bella had no sooner beheld Ferraro, than the golden light 
 she long had watched for, dawned upon her soul, and all 
 the mysterious properties of her nature, which had lain in 
 aimless abeyance, during the advent of so many prevailing 
 summers, shone revealed at once, and proclaimed, through 
 every fibre of her frame, " Thou art the man" — " de te 
 effata divinata sunt /" The fire of love, like inspiration, 
 came down direct from heaven, to consecrate the still 
 sanctuary of her heart, and there, like the lamp of Vesta, 
 to burn inextinguishable for ever. 
 
 We desire, for obvious reasons, to despatch this part of 
 our relation, in as few words as possible; indeed, were it 
 otherwise, there was something of indecorous hurry and 
 mystery, in the commencement, and progress of this ill- 
 fated liason, which, with all our endeavours, we have 
 never been able to elucidate. This hath arisen, no doubt, 
 from the scrupulous privacy which was found indispen- 
 sable, in carrying on such an intrigue. Let it suffice, that, 
 however it came to pass, one little month had not elapsed, 
 from the time of Ferraro's arrival in the city, ere, mutu- 
 ally betraying and betrayed, the haughty and susceptible 
 Isabella, not only gifted the too amiable secretary with

 It was subsequent to the plenary dishonour, which the 
 consistency of our narrative, and the full development of 
 events have obliged us to glance at, that Antoine Ferraro 
 set eyes on the beautiful heroine of our tale. The intro- 
 duction was attended with circumstances, from which 
 after-occurrences drew an omen, and which seem to 
 demand a greater latitude of retrospect, than were correct 
 or fitting, in the depicture of those other " love passages," 
 to which we have just barely alluded. There was a grand 
 gala, given by Cardinal Martinuzzi, in commemoration 
 of the natal day of the Queen of Hungary, when the 
 attendance of all the high and noble in Hermanstadt, fol- 
 lowed of course. The regal splendour and festivity dis- 
 played on this occasion do not fall, within the scope of 
 our plan to enlarge upon ; if the fair reader will please 
 to call to mind the gorgeous minutias of the last rout, she 
 graced with her presence, she will save us the necessity 
 of a lengthened description. Mutato nomine, it may be 
 made to answer the purpose. We merely advert to this 
 entertainment, which, indeed, occurred before the legiti- 
 mate opening of our story, in order to snatch from oblivion 
 certain startling circumstances, which solemnised the first 
 meeting of Czerina and Ferraro. The festal scene was 
 laid in the Gothic hall of the citadel ; flambeaux of per- 
 fumed wax, effusing a subtle and potent odour, \vere 
 upheld by the long row of liveried pages, stationed at 
 close intervals amid the pillars, which supported the 
 groined and lofty roof, and the voluptuous flame flowed 
 and ebbed, in concert with the graceful and expressive 
 undulation of the Hungarian dance, or ugros. //ere pant-

 ed beauty, whose small feet ceased to flit in the demi- 
 mazy round,* crimsoning, and half breathless, with the 
 delicious animation of the national galoppe, whilst on her 
 ear, the prevailing sigh, perchance frighted with languid 
 passion, broke, to be treasured in her memory for ever. 
 There stood apart the statesman, or the warrior, gazing on 
 the assembly, according to the character of the man, 
 with interest, indifference, or contempt ; whilst, in the 
 midst of yon group, on a somewhat elevated dais-plat- 
 form, at the upper end of the hall, sat Martinuzzi, circled 
 by the wise and the aspiring, himself most wise of all, and, 
 as some misdoubted, the most aspiring. And now the 
 guests had nearly all arrived, when suddenly there arose 
 a general call to the attendants, to relumine their lights. 
 A pallid sulphureous hue had diffused itself around, and 
 many a ruddy cheek, all at once, grew colourless. The 
 glow of manhood, and the flushed features of panting 
 loveliness, alike dimmed and waxed pale, in that blue and 
 vaporous atmosphere, the flambeaux were relumed, but 
 the pestilent gloom deepened. At that moment, a tall, 
 mysterious figure, having its cowl so far drawn upon its 
 head, as to conceal the features, suddenly entered, and 
 slowly glided up the entire length of the hall. The effect 
 was electrical ; it was not mirth, merely, but life, which 
 seemed suspended ; tongues, that wagged the instant 
 before, broke off'in the midst ; eyes, that ever previously 
 sparkled, now dimmed ; the sweeping robes of the ladies 
 ceased to rustle, the clank of the knight's gilded spur, 
 without which accompaniment, according to the opinion, 
 and proverbial expression of the Hungarian lassie, a

 dancer might be likened to " a kiss without a beard," 
 no longer beat time to his agile tread ; even the very 
 harmony, the musicians had just shot through the en- 
 tranced air, soon lost its spell and its enticement, and 
 insensibly died away into tremulous silence ; no sound 
 was audible, save the quick, short respiration of the 
 guests ; and the death-like pallor, which usurped the 
 natural hue of their complexion, proved that the spirit of 
 awe, and superstition had sunk into their hearts. Several 
 of the pages, and badged servitors hastily fled the 
 scene of ghastly excitement, bearing av/ay with them 
 the waxen torches. The remaining lights, though not 
 extinguished, seemed partially eclipsed, by some potent 
 interposition ; and as the monk, like a spirit, passed 
 through the recoiling assembly, an unnatural chillness 
 crept on the misty air. Shortly, this horror-compelling 
 being attained the chair of state, where sat the lord 
 regent, who, with displeased mien, and eyes, apparently 
 fixed on his movements, awaited his confessor's coming. 
 He reached the spot, when, just as he was in the act of 
 muttering some close whisper in Martinuzzi's ear, two 
 side, and opposite doors of the apartment simultaneously 
 threw open their folding leaves, and through the one, a 
 splendid vision, like the breaking east, burst on the sight 
 and soul, in the form of our youthful heroine, by whose 
 lithe, and ethereal shape, and springy footfall, the very 
 Hebe had been rivalled. Hers was, indeed, a figure, 
 worthy to be seized by the sculptor, if he had wished a 
 
 study for

 Czerina was companioned by a bevy of fair damsels, 
 who followed in her train, and who, though some of the 
 comeliest daughters of the land, were conspicuously 
 thrown into shade, by the surpassing charms of their royal

 door, entered Ferraro, and, as the two thus fronted one 
 another, those near might have caught the grand secret 
 of natural sculpture, alike from the square formation of 
 the forehead, ample elevated chest, and sinewy charac- 
 teristics of the young secretary, and from the swimming 
 voluptuous contour of the sylph-like queen. Like the 
 Medicean Venus, to whom alone she might compare ; 
 her stature was slightly below the medium height of 
 womanhood, but the development of her shape was 
 perfect, and every limb was rounded to the last inimita- 
 ble touch of nature. In truth, time, the sorcerer, had 
 not been idle with that Peri shape, since we remember 
 our heroine, in her girlhood, her ears imperforate, — not 
 yet pierced by the sharp trephine,. .. .that symbolical 
 initiatory, that " little go," (to apply a college phrase,) 
 so typical of the future ; whereby we infer, that a tender

 acting her mysterious dream or night-mare in the vaults

 had wrought their wonted magical touches, upon the 
 light symmetry of her figure, — still, for her, childhood 
 itself, seemed to linger, as if loath to resign her dove- 
 like attributes, even at that interesting period of life, 
 when adolescence is languidly departing, like the 
 crimped and mossy cone, which, in the early court- 
 ings of the spring, expands its virgin petala to view, and 
 the mind is left uncertain, whether, indeed, the incipient 
 and half-blown floweret can be said to be developed into 
 a rose, or yet locks her beauties in a bud. But the 
 sense, the soul, of the female, is ever ripe and precocious, 
 compared with her more visible and material loveliness ;

 her nature, —

 She was splendidly arrayed for the occasion. Her 
 dress was a low tunic and skirt of satin, of a hue, only 
 less dazzling and pure, than the transparent beauties, it 
 encircled, and contributed to veil. A cincture, studded 
 with pearls, as white as truth, defined her minute, and 
 ariel-like waist, "sized to Love's wish,"t and braced up, 
 (how needlessly !) an alabaster world, which might excel, 
 in certain essentials, the bust of the Venus de Canova. 
 Over all, hung a long simar, of Florence satin, whose 
 gorgeous embroidery swept the ground. Her profuse, 
 and resplendent hair, braided in a chaplet of milk-white 
 pearls, and gracefully arranged, loosened, here and 
 there, its amber torrent, which, in the form of luxuriant 
 ringlets, might be seen floating over her snowy neck and 
 shoulders ; and (so low as the envious robe permitted), 
 upon the swell of her more brilliant bosom, whose light 
 and undulating motion, would dafF the wanton intruders 
 aside, as the small, slowly-lifted billows of Pactolus,

 and a precious reliquary, bedded in gems as rare, and 
 steeped in rosenohl,X hung from her slenderly-rounded 
 throat, by a thin carcanet of gold. From her head, 
 even to her feet, a deep and silvery veil, fringed with 
 gold, loosely flung its transparent folds, which, from 
 their subtle texture and material, might have been mis- 
 taken for floating gossamer. The wide falling sleeve, open 
 from above the elbow, disclosed her tapering and grace- 
 ful arms ; a plain bracelet of gold spanned her slender

 a combination of simple elegance, which suited well with 
 the first freshness of her youth, and the dream-like cha- 
 racter of her beauty. 
 
 At the first glance he caught of the young queen, Fer- 
 raro started back involuntarily, and then fixed his un- 
 conscious, yet scorching gaze upon a countenance, re- 
 plete with such assemblage of matchless fascinations, as 
 beauty is a word too weak for. One glance of her full 
 sapphiric and brilliant orbs, — that, freighted with the 
 very soul of sensibility, and glowing in the vapoury sha- 
 dow of silken lashes, looked out from under brows, dis- 
 tinctly pencilled, and arched in the true lineaments of 
 grace; drank the very essence of his manhood, for all to 
 come of life. Her cherry lips, dewy, and curling up, 
 with an indefinable, but luscious expression, if they be- 
 tokened a little passion, or rather self-will, were indica- 
 tive also of a deal of sensibility. Her cheek, without 
 being so full, as not to harmonize with the delicate mould- 
 ing of her other features, was exquisitely rounded. Her 
 nose was elegantly cast, the nostril having somewhat of 
 a slight Grecian curve. Her chin was accurately convex, 
 and its single voluptuous dimple, cupid's arsenal. 
 
 Before Ferraro's dizzy eyes all things swam, as Cze- 
 rina, with elastic gait, advanced up the apartment. The 
 illusive and artificial lights, ..the shining draperies,. . the 
 distant fretted roof,, .the long perspective of marble pil- 
 lars, with their gilt embossments, their flowery carvings, 
 and gay festooned capitals,, .the garlands,, .the sweep of 
 the splendid hangings,, .the gorgeous decorations,, .the 
 atmosphere, suffocating as that, coflfined up in char- 
 nel vaults,.. the glimmering torches meteoric gleam, like 
 those melancholy fires, which dimly flicker up the sha- 
 dowy courts of that colossal skeleton, whose name is 
 Death,.. the still existences, — looking like inanimate 
 or monumental forms, putting on life itself, along with 
 life's mocking ornaments,, .the stricken and appalled

 expression of the human features, reflected, as it were, 
 through a vaporous medium of sulphur-blue,, .all that 
 conspired to make a scene, which might aptly represent 
 the jubilee of the dead, ..each of these particulars, and 
 all of them, harmonized together, blended, and given 
 back in the gaudy beams of continuous tiikorommels, or 
 lofty mirrors, — were utterly disregarded in the one, deep, 
 absorbing impression, which our heroine had made on 
 the heart of hearts of Ferraro. He reeled after, rather 
 than followed, her fairy footsteps, unconscious of all else 
 in the world, and hardly less rapt than the Danish prince, 
 when he tracks the shade of his sire. 
 
 Czerina, meanwhile, wonderingly, made her way to- 
 wards the upper end of the apartment, and her guardian 
 rose, so as to receive her, near the foot of his throne. 
 In the usual course of things, it must have excited the 
 marvel of some of those present, that their native sove- 
 reign, was thus let measure the entire length of that hall, 
 unaided, and without a shadow of ceremony, whilst Mar- 
 tinuzzi, apparently lost in solemn musing, hardly prof- 
 fered more welcome to the queen of Hungary, than he 
 might have deigned to exhibit, on such a festival, to the 
 humblest hand-maid of her court ; but whatever indig- 
 nation, the regent's discourteous behaviour had other- 
 wise operated, was quickly stifled, in the universal, and 
 appalling impression, that he, the Mano, the evil spirit 
 of the land, now incarnate beneath the sacerdotal vest- 
 ments of Father Dominick, stalked unannounced 
 amongst them. That he, who had hitherto restricted his 
 beat to the chambers of the dead, or the vaults of sorcery, 
 now, for some fatal cause, obtruded himself in moments 
 of festivity, and despite even the comforting reality of 
 the blaze of lights, the pressure and the voices, — that the 
 unholy being dared present himself, in the very hold and 
 circle, at the very celebration, as it were, of human life. 
 Martinuzzi exchanged greetings, with the Lady Czerina, 
 and offered his gratulations, on the joyous occasion, with

 infinitely more appearance of cordiality, than, on her first 
 entrance, his abstraction of manner promised. Yet the 
 more accurate observer might, perhaps, have detected, 
 in the patronizing tones of his voice, in the quiet, and 
 condescending smile of the blue eye, as it ran over every 
 line of loveliness, and, so to speak, in the encouraging 
 mode of his address, rather the superior, though kind bear- 
 ing of the guardian and tutor, to his pupil, than the be- 
 seeming and defined deference of a subject, to his queen. 
 The compliments of Martinuzzi were closed, with a deep 
 sigh ; for an instant, he again seemed lost in profound 
 and painful musing : then, abruptly snatching the hand 
 of Czerina, he prepared to conduct her to the chair of 
 state, covered with cloth of gold, which, surmounted by 
 the same silken canopy, had been prepared, near to his 
 own. Just at that moment. Father Dominick stood be- 
 side the regent, and his shadow rose gigantic, against the 
 wall. " Your highness," he said, in that congealing 
 hollow tone of voice, peculiar to him, but still so accu- 
 rately pitched, as only to reach the ears of Martinuzzi ; 
 " your highness, he is come, present him." 
 
 " Not yet, — not on the present occasion," answered 
 the cardinal, unconsciously loud. 
 
 " Yes, now," rejoined the monk ; " I am wanted else- 
 where, and 'twill relieve the pale company to have me 
 hence ; only let me first witness the seal to our long- 
 pending treaty. He is nigh." 
 
 ** I see him not," returned Martinuzzi. 
 
 Father Dominick moved aside, and, by his change of 
 position, exposed to the sight of the regent, the figure of 
 the Austrian secretary. 
 
 Ferraro had followed the steps of Czerina through 
 the apartments, with straining eye and agitated gesture, 
 whilst, on the dim arena of his inmost heart, there 
 struggled emotions, such as transported Romeo, when, 
 in the person of the fair Capulet, he recognised the

 embodied creation of his first phantasma of female excel- 
 lence; the realization of that ideal form of beauty, which 
 gilded his earliest dream of passion. Ferraro was sta- 
 tioned, at a short distance, from the unconscious object 
 of his instinctive adoration. 
 
 ** Here /" exclaimed a voice, whose most emphatic 
 and distinct intonation, issuing from an uncertain direc- 
 tion, thrilled through the very hearts of all who heard it. 
 
 ^' Here ! let the children's troth now be plighted, and 
 the compact of their sires, this way, find fulfilment." 
 
 With a piercing cry, Czerina started some paces from 
 the spot ; her throat strained, and her bosom, whiter than 
 the whitest Parian marble, rose and fell, as if with some 
 strong internal emotion ; her cheek lost its vermeil 
 teint — her whole frame shuddered, from limb to limb. 
 
 " Here r reiterated the same hollow voice. 
 
 " Merciful God ! how can it be?" shrieked Czerina, 
 her eye glancing, from the confessor to the lord regent, as 
 if struck by some idea, which troubled her senses. Mar- 
 tinuzzi took an involuntary step forward, but, at that 
 moment, the pale maiden sunk, in a species of syncope, 
 into the extended arms of Ferraro. The scene of terror 
 and tumult, which ensued, on that startled company's 
 recovering from their first amazement, the reader may 
 more readily imagine, than we depict. There arose a 
 hubbub of voices through the room, '* Seize him! trai- 
 tor !" rang confusedly on all sides. Some one or two, 
 bolder than the majority, disposed to put the universal 
 feeling into action, rushed forwards. ** Which?" — 
 " Where is he ?" 
 
 " At your elbow," burst at once from several tongues. 
 
 " How ? — fled ? — yes, no — stop him vanished !" 
 
 It was under the mysterious circumstance, which we 
 have commemorated, that the love of Ferraro took its 
 commencement. His best affections were properly fore- 
 stalled by another object, and that inauspicious mad-

 ness of an unguarded hour, colored the pilgrimage of long 
 years, and, like the star of his fate, crossed the orbit of 
 his life's young hopes, to pervade, with its fatal astro- 
 logy, the remainder of his wayfaring ! — Oh ! there is a 
 poetical justice shown at times, in the awarding, even of 
 this world's punishment, which does the stern heart of 
 man good to dwell upon. It is on such occasions, we 
 recognise the descent of a mightier and a meet Avator. 
 It is then, that we raise our eyes to the Omniscient 
 Ruler, and feel, that there is a knowledge, greater than 
 that of man, — a power to strike, surpassing human 
 strength. It is then we commune, with our still bosoms, 
 and acknowledge that One liveth, who is privy to " our 
 ingoings and our outcomings ;" and it is in those mo- 
 ments, we are made to comprehend, that, what, to the ex- 
 ternal j udgment of our fellow mortals, may appear to be an 
 infliction, or even a retribution, for delinquency, done in 
 the light of day, is, in earnest, the visitation of Heaven, 
 on the embryo weakness, the vanity, the anticipatory in- 
 clinations, not yet degenerated into action, pent in the 
 abyss of our hearts, deeper than ever plummet sounded, 
 and which only the ever-present eternity of God's sight * 
 might apprehend. "Often when the soul sins," says a 
 profoundly eloquent writer, '' her loftiest feelings are 
 punished by her lowest." f The guilt is scourged by 
 means of the folly, for, like the warmth and light of 
 Heaven's luminary, guilt and folly are so intimately 
 blended, as to be inextricably one. 
 
 " The Heavens are just, and of our pleasant vices, 
 Make whips to scourge us." 
 
 Thus argued Ferraro, as he revolved over, in the sanc- 
 tuary of thought, the many obstacles to his ever attain- 
 ing the consummation of his wishes, and felt (with that 
 loathing of himself, which will sometimes steal across

 the sinner, on finding the fruition of sin to be its rightful 
 heritage, and that the proper punishment of our evil 
 desires, is incident to their possession) that, however 
 wretched his destiny, it was not the hand of fate, but of 
 his own irregular appetites, had woven the darlc thread, 
 which ran through the web of futurity, to mesh him in 
 its toils. What one of the ancients has very elegantly 
 said of malice, may be predicated of other vices, — they 
 drink one-half of their own poison ;* but true love, like 
 lightning, overleaps all constraint, all fence, riding upon 
 a thought. 
 
 Ferraro followed up his first introduction. He met 
 our heroine in secret, and the natural sympathy of two 
 young, and beautiful, and (as respected the lady at 
 least) pure beings, begun in instinct, matured rapidly 
 into esteem, and was shortly ratified by judgment. Well 
 wert thou compared, oh Love ! in the Song of Solomon, f 
 to Death. Truly, thou art as sad a leveller, and hast, 
 though in a different way, his chiefest attributes, — pulling 
 down the mighty, and setting up the humble. Thou 
 canst burst thy coil, and, with thy eternal wings, make 
 free the heart in agony, the soul in dust and chaos. 
 How strong art thou, in thy very waywardness ! how 
 deceitful, in thy purity and faith ! how conscious, even 
 in thy blindness ! God of this false world ! that couchest 
 in the dimples of youthful beauty, and, in the conse- 
 crated round of maidens' bosoms, hast raised a taber- 
 nacle to thy worship, why dost thou invariably resort to 
 the meanness of finesse, and prompt to all the paltry- 
 nesses of subterfuge and double dealing ? And where- 
 fore, as in the mystery of thy last sacrifice, so also in 
 that of thine initiatory rites, dost thou dissemble with 
 truth, and throw a veil over the workings of nature, to

 thy glory ? Why doth the incense of thine idolatry 
 darken the labyrinth, which surrounds thine altars ? and, 
 out of the millions of sinuous paths, that lead thereunto, 
 why hast thou not cut one, direct, and smooth, and free 
 from sorrow, and deceit, which is sorrow ? 
 
 In the more retired and private grounds, attached to 
 the gardens of the palace, (which were all included 
 within the precincts of the city fortifications), Ferraro 
 was used, during the brief and feverish hey-day of his 
 intrigue with Isabella, to compass frequent interviews, 
 with that unhappy lady. To this end, in the dawn of 
 her fatal prepossession, she had presented him with a 
 key, which unlocked a small postern, built in the hollow 
 of the wall, opening nigh a pavilion, formed by the pro- 
 tecting foliage of several giant beech trees. Here, 
 softest twilight floated, and the hugh magnitude and 
 strict embrace of interlacing boughs, made a cool um- 
 brage of noon-day, and of sun-set, dunnest night. Be- 
 neath this umbrageous arch, whose dense summit shut 
 him out from the eyes of heaven, were his earliest orisons 
 offered up to the idol, who had won his transient and 
 corporeal regard ; and the same temple would witness 
 his guilty vigils. But, from the epoch, that a purer and 
 deeper inclination rose upon his heart, the light, and 
 sensual character of his love for Isabella, flitted from his 
 soul, like a blind mist, that is touched and dissipated, by 
 the holy and searching rays of the morning sun. Never 
 again did he hold his illicit rendezvous, in that fatal 
 pavilion. He avoided it as sedulously as Eneas might 
 have done the cavern, whither the fury of his fate had 
 first driven him, and he carefully shunned all further 
 communication, with his royal paramour, as the Phrygian 
 Blifii (without having been governed by so honourable a 
 motive,) fled the presence of the enamoured Dido. By 
 means of the key, which, in her delirious abandonment 
 to bliss, Isabella had originally given him, Ferraro gained 
 access, at all hours, to the palace gardens, and met at

 first, by singular and recurring accidents, and afterwards 
 by habitual appointment, (implied, if not expressed,) the 
 beautiful heroine of our history. 
 
 The mysterious process in the heart of Czerina, which 
 brought about this indulgence, it were hardly fair, though 
 not difficult, to analyze. The fine, intermediate grada- 
 tions, which connect the incipient liking, with the final 
 stage of woman's first love, arc usually imperceptible, 
 and too evanescent for her own consciousness. Czerina 
 was innocent, and innocence is apt to be inconsiderate ; 
 she was young, and youth, we know, is without distrust. 
 From the haughty indifference, and cool sarcasm of her 
 mother, from the stern and strict lectures of her guar- 
 dian, from the solitude of her chamber, or the irksome- 
 ness of court formalities, it was ecstacy to steal to 
 Ferraro, and, with new and entranced emotion, to listen 
 to the outbreakings of his honeyed breath, and mark 
 his words, as they took the form of eloquence, or thrill 
 (without knowing why) beneath the still more dangerous 
 oratory of his glances. 
 
 " Teneris heu lubrica moribus aetas!''* 
 
 Oh ! it was sweet thraldom for both, . . it was like re- 
 curring to that first freshness of feeling, which built the 
 paradise" of Eden, to have their young hearts thus en- 
 chained, at many fleeting opportunities, all in solitude 
 and in seclusion. Whenever Czerina could make her 
 escape, she would saunter, with Ferraro, amid the copses 
 and glades, close at hand, or along the sequestered, and 
 indirect paths of the royal inclosure, both unconscious 
 of any thing, but the pleasure of each other's conversa- 
 tion. But she would invariably turn from the more fre- 
 quented avenues, so as not to render herself obnoxious 
 to observation ; yet this procedure ever took place, on 
 her part, with so little participation of consciousness, that

 really we can scarcely allow it to have been an act of 
 volition. Her feminine rectitude, and maidenly purity, 
 are not to be questioned ; but, ah ! at her age, though 
 the heart be incapable of guile, it is peculiarly suscepti- 
 ble, and, in its deep recesses, what dim and undefined 
 sensations lie couched, almost inactive, and only fated 
 to burst forth into existence, after the pressure of one 
 Promethean spring. Still, she somehow or other sus- 
 pected, she was not acting quite in accordance, with the 
 forms of maidenhood, in permitting Ferraro and herself 
 these furtive, and delicious hours of intercourse, though 
 a deeper philosophy — the subtle instinct of nature — 
 corrected this vague, but painful sense of impropriety, and 
 persuaded her, there could be no danger or indiscretion 
 in her secret assignations, panoplied, as she knew she 
 was, with her own dove-like modesty and conscious in- 
 nocence, as in mail of proof. " To the pure all things 
 are pure," so, in her secret soul, she made a sort of com- 
 promise with her principles, (if, indeed, her indistinct 
 glimmerings of what was requisite, can properly be so 
 styled,) and, deeming, the decorum of her sex and sta- 
 tion prescribed a needless sacrifice to punctilio, she inly 
 resolved to elude having that sacrifice enforced, by keep- 
 ing the harsh world in the dark, as to her proceedings. 
 
 Oh ! there is no subtler casuist, than the internal pre- 
 dilection of our own hearts ! or surely, Czerina might 
 have reflected, that the concealment constituted the error, 
 — that, however indiscreet to carry on the intimacy, in the 
 face of day, it could hardly, in that case, be deemed 
 criminal, but that an intercourse, such as hers, with 
 Ferraro, prosecuted in secrecy, assumed a deeper, and a 
 more delicate character, and rendered her liable to im- 
 putations, which she would have shrunk into the earth, 
 to suppose her conduct authorized. One thing, however, 
 should be noted, — no warm breathing of positive affection 
 had ever hitherto escaped the lips of Ferraro — he under- 
 stood better what he was about, — he rightly apprehended,

 that, with so primitively innocent a being, it were impo- 
 litic to give point to the mysteries of the heart, by ven- 
 turing a specific declaration. Even his short experience 
 had taught him, he was only likely to retard and confound 
 the incipient development of young love, in an extremely 
 pure and guileless bosom, by agitating the question of its 
 existence, before the tender plant had attained its, other- 
 wise, inevitable growth. There is ever, besides, a natural 
 diffidence, incident to genuine affection, which will cause 
 Passion to hide his arrows, and his torch, for fear of giving 
 offence, and which, is calculated to restrain within bounds 
 the transports, even of the boldest lover. This sentiment, 
 without other concurrent inducements, might have long 
 withheld Ferraro, from rashly explaining to their amiable 
 object, the state of his affections. However it came 
 about, Czerina, for a considerable time, held unrestrained 
 and delighted intercommunication with the Austrian 
 envoy, without a suspicion shadowing her guileless bosom 
 in respect to his object, or any inadvertence, on his part, 
 gifting with a premature character of activity, the incli- 
 nation of her sliding heart. There is no saying, how 
 much longer such *' pure ignorance" might have lasted, 
 had it not been partially enlightened by one marked event, 
 occurring about this period, that helped to give a precise 
 determination to her previous vague reveries, and dreams. 
 The incident we allude to, as it affords a glimpse, into the 
 character of our heroine, we shall proceed forthwith to 
 lay before the reader. 
 
 It was one evening, after having prolonged her custo- 
 mary ramble, beyond the usual hour, that she found, on 
 her return to the palace, the lord regent waiting for her ia 
 an ante-room of her apartment; and, since what occurred, 
 on that occasion, will tend to explain the condition of her 
 heart, and must illustrate, in some sort, the anomalous and 
 uncommon relations, subsisting betwixt Martinuzzi and 
 his royal ward, we shall take the privilege of our craft, to 
 detail, with less regard to brevity than is our wont, the 
 particulars of their colloquy.

 Martinuzzi sat absorbed, at a short distance from the 
 door, having the pahn of his one hand clasped against his 
 forehead, when Czerina, with noiseless step, and height- 
 ened pulse, entered the room. It was a sort of saloon of 
 moderate dimensions, most choice and delicate in its 
 decorations, and commanding, from its single window, a 
 prospect of the plaisance and its embowered terraces. 
 Not until after several moments had gone by, did the 
 regent condescend to notice the presence of his ward : 
 at length he slowly raised his eyes. The intellectual hue 
 of his face seemed worn into perfect paleness, and there 
 was a severe and thoughtful meaning, lightly chiselled 
 into hieroglyphics, on the expanse of his lordly brow, and 
 also traced, even more legibly, throughout the expressive 
 repose of his other features, a meaning, which Czerina 
 caught in a single glance, and which, however used to 
 his peculiar manner, and inured (if the reader will let 
 the expression pass) to his pathetic sternnes<^, she in- 
 stinctively trembled, in the present instance, to interpret. 
 
 *' Hither lady," said Martinuzzi, rising, and Czerina, with 
 feverish perturbation, crossed the room, to the place, where 
 the lofty, and erect form of her guardian stood out, in 
 bold and distinct relief, against the casement. Calm, 
 still, with his eyes fixed steadfastly on her lovely coun- 
 tenance, mutable and transparent as those skies, which lit 
 it up with something of their own rich hue, Martinuzzi 
 contemplated the youthful queen, for a while, in silent 
 and earnest thoughtfulness. When he spoke, Czerina 
 fancied, she recognised an impressive solemnity, in the 
 tones of his voice, whose authoritative cadence, qualified 
 by melancholy tenderness, had at all times a strange 
 power over her. She could not be sure of aught unusual ; 
 but the thrilling chillness, with which the bare imagina- 
 tion had stricken her heart, for a moment, froze her life- 
 blood, at its source. 
 
 The state of her feelings towards Martinuzzi, had 
 long been a problem to Czerina, — mixed and indefin-

 able, they were such, as not all our other annals of 
 this world's metaphysics might parallel. Haughty from 
 her birth, her pride, nourished by the consciousness 
 of her endowments, mental and bodily, and by the 
 anticipation of that universal homage, they were cal- 
 culated to inspire, was, as it were, confirmed and justified, 
 by the emblazoned scroll of her royal ancestry. She 
 felt indignant, at the cardinal's usurpation of her mother's 
 co-ordinate jurisdiction, during her own minority; — that 
 mother, by persevering in her animosity against Marti- 
 nuzzi, inspired into her daughter the same prejudices, by 
 which, she herself had long been actuated. Daily grew 
 Czerina more jealous of her guardian's ultimate purpose, 
 and more alive to the thousand echoes of that whispering 
 gallery, where slander holds her court, and whose minutest 
 breath, day after day, coupling the name of Martinuzzi 
 with every variety of wilful falsehood, and detraction, 
 broke on her ear, as with the voice of a trumpet, and 
 worked like a poison, at her heart. Infected, from the 
 earliest dawn of intellect, by all who approached her, 
 with suspicions and distrust, of the character and designs 
 of her guardian, who, in his administration of her aifairs, 
 had long confounded that office, with an authority not 
 quite so legitimate, and who, though mild and courteous 
 in his demeanour to others, was commonly absolute, and 
 inflexible in his relation with herself, — notwithstanding 
 all these concurrent causes to inspire her hatred, though 
 her proud soul might tremble to its centre, before his 
 determined and arbitrary will; yet, she knew, in her 
 heart, she not only respected, but actually revered that 
 man; yea, him, the despoiler of her mother's rights, and 
 the probable usurper of her own diadem, and proper in- 
 heritance, she could not choose but revere. What was 
 the charm, which bound down her free nature, as with 
 bonds of iron? In what consisted the spell? — the ascen- 
 dency, which, in her case, reversed the ordinary course of 
 human feeling, and constrained her, not only to venerate,

 but love, where her impassioned sense of injustice, and 
 other powerful causes, seemed to prompt, and demand 
 her abhorrence? This was an inquiry, which, though 
 herself scarcely conscious of the extent, and depth of her 
 sentiment towards Martinuzzi, our heroine would some- 
 times put to her own bosom, without its ever meeting 
 with a satisfactory reply. Still, with the fitfulness, na- 
 tural to her sex, her childish indignation, at the peremp- 
 tory proceedings of the regent, would, at times, break out; 
 and now, when all things seemed to intimate, that he 
 meant shortly to put the seal, to his long course of dis- 
 simulation and intrigue, by himself wearing the crown 
 of her royal father, whilst he would fain disguise his am- 
 bition, by the thin pretence of a bull of his holiness, her 
 exasperation had grown to its height; her indignation at 
 his ingratitude and artifice, almost conquered the pre- 
 dilection, we have spoken of above, a predilection, 
 which took a sort of sanctity from those endearing 
 associations and impressions, linked in her grateful me- 
 mory, with Martinuzzi's early and continued tutelage. 
 It was under the influence of this combined feeling of 
 anger and respect, that our heroine was surprised, at 
 meeting with her guardian in her ante-chamber. Having 
 premised thus much, let us beat back. 
 
 " Seat thee, my child ; thou tremblest," said Marti- 
 nuzzi; and Czerina mechanically availed herself of a 
 settee, near the open casement. The regent again spoke; 
 *' A short while since, fair lady," he said, bending a 
 searching glance upon the young queen; " 1 observed, 
 as the last beams of the sun bathed in golden light, the 
 waving tresses of the linden groves, — five minutes can- 
 not have elapsed, — two shadows, thrown, by the planet's 
 slanting rays, on yonder opposite terrace, — thy flowing 
 robe, the high and national plume, that waves so proudly 
 on thy sunken head, — thy light and buoyant air, shaped 
 restless darkness, on the glowing parapet; the one, could 
 not be mistaken, — whose form was it, that the horizontal

 sun traced on the stone canvass, by thy side?" Czerina's 
 cheek burned, whilst her dimpled lip grew colourless, as 
 death's, but remained closed. Bowing low her fair face, she 
 embedded her one hand, in her profuse ringlets. There 
 was an embarrassing pause, which Martinuzzi terminated, 
 by resuming : '* For more than a minute, the forms, I 
 speak of, must have remained unmoved, amid the motes, 
 that danced in the western ray:" he paused, but almost 
 instantly added, in a deep imperative voice, " Still mute, 
 lady? Some cavalier, I need not tell you, judging by his 
 erect and stately bearing, darkened the light beside 
 you ; and you are silent. He was no Hungarian born, 
 for the high head lacked our plumy kalpac. Be pleased 
 to remember. Lady Czerina," he added, with a slightly 
 admonitory gesture, '* what befits your dignity ; what 
 is due to our age and office, and no longer hold this 
 unseemly silence." There was again a short pause; 
 '' I knew not," presently subjoined Martinuzzi, scarce 
 audibly, whilst his features shone with a faint smile; " I 
 knew not, the secretary of Piadena had the privilege 
 of these gardens." A quick sudden rush of confusion 
 spread over the face of Czerina; she drew a deep and 
 long gasp, and half rising, stammered in a voice, but 
 little above her breath. 
 
 " The gentleman met me, and I — I ," she grew 
 
 inarticulate; for she felt the tell-tale blood coursing 
 under her temple, cheek, and burning bosom, with sensi- 
 bility, and with consciousness. 
 
 " It was a dangerous imprudence, my child," said 
 Martinuzzi, with mild emphasis; ''God!" he presently 
 continued, in a deep tone, but so low as to be almost in- 
 audible; '' when, — oh! when will the cloud of these 
 evil mysteries roll away, before the blaze of thy mercy, 
 and we emerge, from shadows and enigmas,* to behold 
 the truth manifest?" Then turning to Czerina, he said;

 " Lady, I am weary of tutorage, and I find the people 
 are grown no less tired, to see the sainted crown, under 
 the shadow of his hand, whose brow, the precious jewel 
 was not made to fit. — Well well, — I wander, for a mo- 
 ment, — there, sit down again, child; I have words to 
 drop into your heart, which are the fruit of long, and 
 painful thought ; for thee, fair lady; for thee, and this 
 vexed land. The time is come, when thou shouldst give 
 a king to Hungary: a friend, protector, to thyself. I 
 have consulted for thy happiness, — he, whom thou shalt 
 
 gift with thy royal hand is one, who, " the Right 
 
 Reverend Father had been let proceed thus far, without 
 interruption; but he was now silenced, by a piercing ex- 
 clamation, from his fair auditor. 
 
 Oh, woman ! who as much exceedest man in appre- 
 hension, as in sensibility, whose whole existence and 
 education merge in thy sex, whose immaterial nature, 
 and physical structure alike indicate rjEornf • . alike point 
 to love, as thy sole end, aim, and scope of being!* 
 Why is thy mate so unworthy of thee ? and why is it, his 
 presumption arrogates a superiority, being mentally, at 
 the best, only thy peer? and in soul; — in all that con- 
 stitutes the poetry, the grace of humanity, so immeasure- 
 ably thine inferior? — The few words of Martinuzzi went 
 to the heart of Czerina; and, as we are taught to believe, 
 that, in another world, glimpses of felicity will suddenly 
 o^en to us, which transcend all finite comprehension ; 
 so the simple sentence, which struck on the ears of our 
 heroine, broke up for her, the deep, and sealed fountain 
 of her soul, discovering a new sense, which must be the 
 making, or the marring of her future life. She could no 
 longer pretend to disguise from her own consciousness, 
 the reality, the strength, and the intensity of her passion 
 for Ferraro. All the hopes, fears, desires, every vernal 
 faculty, and feeling, which had of late made populous the

 Still, and dim-lighted chambers of her heart, and which 
 had been there hoarded, like the treasure of the dreaming- 
 miser, unseen and uncounted, as by a flash of lightning, 
 were suddenly revealed to her mental vision, like shapes 
 at the invocation of the sorcerer; and she knew, that the 
 god had been with her, and had smitten her, and that she 
 loved, — but along with this conviction came the terrible cer- 
 tainty, that she was threatened to be consigned to another ; 
 — not to Ferraro, who had furtively obtained possession 
 of her young afl'ections, but to the object of her guar- 
 dian's choice, who was no other, according to common 
 report, than his nephew. Against such arbitrary dictation, 
 her passions remonstrated, and the blood of all her an- 
 cestry rose up, tingling in her veins, and swelling at her 
 heart. We all, somehow or other, object to compulsion, 
 even when it is meant in kindness; and, in our young 
 days especially, we are apt to have a marvellous over- 
 weening motion of our competence to direct our own 
 affairs; more particularly as to our conduct in that nice, 
 and important article, love or matrimony. Our fair 
 heroine, be it understood, was not a whit less a stickler 
 for her rights, than any gentle reader of this history, 
 being of the same age and sex; and, considering her 
 royal habits and caprices, we are not sure, whether she 
 would not outvie them all in that essential resource, on 
 occasion, which the dear creatures think spirit, and the 
 satirical call, temper. In this instance, this bias of her 
 nature was strongly backed and fortified, by her penchant 
 for Ferraro; and she internally resolved to show fight, and 
 stand up, like a heroine, for her prerogatives of every de- 
 scription. There is nothing like a good heart, at a 
 straight; and Czerina half wondered at her own courage, 
 as she broke in upon her guardian's speech, by exclaim- 
 ing, in a voice, which, like the incarnate passion of the 
 poet, trembled at its own fervour, and shrunk even at the 
 sounds created by itself. 
 
 " What would you have me do ? — marry ?"

 "Ay, marry, lady, would I," returned Martinuzzi, 
 with some surprise. 
 
 Czerina rose erect, on her seat, as though she sat on 
 her throne. Shaking aside the glorious curls, that clus- 
 tered over her high, pure forehead, she looked her guar- 
 dian full in the face, as, extending her hand towards him, 
 and speaking in a firmer, if not a deeper tone, than be- 
 fore, she thus addressed him : " Then take my answer, 
 once for all, your eminence ; when I possess, indeed, 
 what I was born to, it will be time enough to talk of 
 marriage; and then, my lord, I shall be empowered to 
 choose, at once, a husband for myself, and kingdom. 
 Understand that, as yet, I do account myself divided, 
 and am much too wise to cheat myself, and him, be he 
 whosoe'er he may, whom thou wouldst have me call my 
 husband. I have little providence, or constancy — or say 
 1 have ; what I have, I care not to bestow ; so whoso wins 
 me, may not choose to wear. If I seem good, or fair, 
 why I am not so — not proper to be loved — or — in short, 
 your eminence, know, I am a woman, who will not be 
 lightly won ; and recollect, besides, that though our 
 temples yet are naked, we are the queen of Hungary : — 
 and none, none, sir, be he the proudest in our land, 
 shall stoop the royal sceptre so low, as to dispose, with- 
 out our consent, of the hand of our father's child." 
 
 Czerina's rapid and energetic expostulation, here came 
 to a pause, more, as it seemed, for want of breath than 
 words. The hurried impulse of her articulation, commu- 
 nicated an additional tinge of crimson, to the mantling 
 colour of her face and neck, where the whole Magyar 
 blood, of her minute and fairy form, seemed, for a mo- 
 ment, to vault : her eyes flashed a determination, which 
 meetly corresponded, with the decided seriousness of her 
 gesture and language. The energy of her will, roused 
 by the unusual excitement, united with her natural 
 charms, in spite of the delicate character of her love- 
 liness, to throw a sublime and imposing animation, over

 her appearance. She, who ever, till that moment, 
 seemed of too infantile a temper, to imagine a harsh 
 thought, or give vent to an intemperate word, now ap- 
 peared to have grown, at once, beyond her size and 
 years : her whole soul swelled with the stateliness of her 
 avowed resolution, and her sympathising frame glowed, 
 and expanded into majesty. 
 
 Martinuzzi turned away, and paced up and down the 
 apartment, for several seconds, seemingly lost in reverie ; 
 then retiring within the arch of the deep-sunk casement, 
 he looked forth on the evening, and, as if soliloquizing 
 with himself, murmured, scarce audibly : " Ah ! I see ; 
 this day is wasted down to the dregs — is overlived ; the 
 fountains of the hallowed light * spring silently and 
 slowly, and the tide of beamy noon, hath fled up to the 
 arch, and sleeps — how near its source ! (my child, look 
 yonder) past those amber clouds, (do you observe) which 
 seem the rocks of that most glorious ocean shore. I must 
 be gone." 
 
 Martinuzzi moved from the window, and then resumed : 
 
 *' Fare-thee-well. You said. Lady Czerina, we should 
 have further converse, touching this matter — those were 
 your words. Did you not say so?" 
 
 *' No, indeed," replied Czerina, while she felt her 
 heart throb high, in her breast, and her little foot be- 
 spoke her irritable mood, by its rapid glancings, on the 
 polished floor : '' I declared that I would never — " 
 
 "True, true, my child," interrupted the cardinal, with 
 stern emphasis ; " I remember ; you said, that you would 
 marry, and so give a king to the Magyar orszdg ;f you 
 said, it was enough, since it was my counsel — mine — do 
 you mark ? — your guardian's counsel ; and you said, you 
 would abide by it." 
 
 Czerina's pride, and self-will, could ill endure this des-

 potic resolution, of her guardian, to control her affec- 
 tions, and dispose of her hand, contrary to her inclina- 
 tions. Her respiration was very audible, as she warmly 
 answered: " I pray you no more of this; you urge me too 
 far, my lord cardinal. I never even thought the words 
 you speak for me. Suffer me, your eminence, to with- 
 draw." 
 
 Czerina arose, and, making a low conge, was on the 
 point of leaving the apartment, when the short, stern 
 tones of her guardian's voice, arrested her footsteps. 
 
 " Lady ! how's this ? I bid thee go not. Stay ! I com- 
 mand you. Stay!" he repeated, with increased vehe- 
 mence, " lest your course lead to the scaffold." 
 
 Czerina turned back, and approaching some few paces 
 nearer, where the regent stood, there paused, whilst an 
 angry blush overspread her countenance, as if through 
 impatience at being detained. 
 
 Martinuzzi again spoke, but more mildly; "Havel 
 not stilled the restless glass of time, to talk with thee, 
 the while, and wilt thou leave me?" 
 
 ** Forgive me," said Czerina ; " but I liked not the 
 subject of your discourse. I cannot wed, at present ; 
 no, indeed." 
 
 *' And why so, fair lady ?" 
 
 " Because, as I have said, it is my will," answered the 
 maiden proudly ; " so importune me not, sir." 
 
 "This to me!" exclaimed the regent. 
 
 " Why not?" began Czerina, when, meeting the me- 
 lancholy gaze of her guardian, fixed upon her, with an 
 inscrutable expression, a feeling came over her, which 
 she could not analyze, and she instantly broke off, merely 
 adding, in a softened and deprecatory tone, " yet no, 
 not to thee;" — then half-averting her countenance, to 
 hide the tear, that had started to her eye, she repeated ; 
 " Not to thee. Oh ! pardon me, your eminence." 
 
 " Lady," said Martinuzzi, speaking in a deep, and so-

 lemn voice, yet with an abstracted air, as if communing 
 with himself, rather than replying to her : " Life slips 
 from underneath us; eternity lieth in wait, dragging down 
 centuries, generations, empires, into its abysm. A re- 
 generative principle is carrying on, for ever, extracting 
 from the sepulchral womb of earth, its sterile quality, 
 and, out of the very corruption of vitality, presenting the 
 seeds of life and renovation, perpetually revivifying the 
 system of creation; reproducing, again and again, until 
 time shall be no more, from materials continually over- 
 worn, the countless generations of the children of Adam.

 to be done i' the state, are held suspense the while ;

 wasted to the grave, let's now be stirring, lady. 
 Power hath no spell to trim the wings of time, to accom- 
 modate his speed to our caprice, to chain him down, as 
 was once fabled, while slaves ran riot, or slept away

 come — here shall thy proud course be stayed,' while men

 not draw the breath of vital air in dreams, but act." 
 
 He paused, and then abruptly turning to the maiden, 
 inquired, " When will you receive your lover as your hus- 
 band ? — Say." 
 
 Czerina advanced, with a proud, determined step, close 
 up to the regent. The rays of the setting luminary, 
 striking obliquely on her transparent temple, tinted it 
 with his own warm hues, and even seemed to have lent a 
 portion of his intolerable splendour to her eyes. Her 
 carriage was haughty, and her rich voice, attuned by the 
 impulses of her spirit, rang through the chamber, like 
 the breathing of the celestial wind, along the chords of 
 some harp ceolian, as she made answer — "I said I'd 
 hear no more of this : am I to speak again ? I will not.

 wed to please you. Now, once for all, you have my 
 answer." She ceased, and resumed her seat. 
 
 Martinuzzi did, indeed, knit his brow ; a flush, like 
 the passing brightness of the sun, shot athwart his coun- 
 tenance ; he fixed his eyes keenly on her unabashed fore- 
 head, as if to reach her heart, and dissect its capillary 
 fibres ; whilst the intonation of his voice grew on her 
 ears, like the deep base of the cataract. — " Your answer, 
 froward girl !" he cried. *' Be for ever silent, rather 
 than speak the language, I abhor. Oh ! take heed — 
 take heed, I say. Never to me, Vv^ith such authority, 
 proclaim thy rebel will ! It is a crime as foul — fouler 
 than common parricide, to blast my hopes, to shrivel up 
 the freshness of my heart, with such accursed lightnings 
 as thou dartest, even now, from, thy unrighteous eye." 
 
 Czerina recoiled before the tempest she had raised. 
 The blood, which, the instant before, filled every vein in 
 her cheeks and forehead, now retreated to her heart ; 
 her eye quailed, under the penetrating look, she encoun- 
 tered ; and while involuntary apprehension, and a wish 
 to appear unmoved, strongly contended, in her feeble 
 voice, and self-doubting deportment, she faltered out — 
 " My lord, I will not be terrified." 
 
 " No word !" thundered Martinuzzi, suddenly grasp- 
 ing her arm — '' no word, lady!" he repeated, with a 
 look of mysterious, but terrible import, " or by the om- 
 nipotence of my tongue! I will, with thee, from our 
 proud giddy height, . . . the frightful precipice of glory 
 that we stand on * — plunge headlong down, into the gulf 
 beneath. We're lifted to the brink, and, at our feet, a 
 grave of infamy unfathomable yawns, ready to receive, 
 and shiver us to atoms. Yea, they shall wreathe about 
 thy delicate white limbs a rusty chain, which, like a 
 snake, enamoured of thy loveliness, shall gnaw a passage

 to thy very core, and bask beside it. Lady, be not con- 
 fident ; rather show me the repentant, and trembling 
 bosom, the pale lip, the quaking hand, the mercy-seeking 
 eye — or, by my holy faith ! thou shalt not live, so proud 
 and beautiful. Tempt not a wrath as hot as flames of 
 hell, lest — there is a word. — Fool! I can make thee 
 nothing, but a laugh." 
 
 The firmness of the young queen wholly gave way 
 under the positive terror of that moment. " Mercy !" 
 she faltered out, looking as pale as death, and trembling 
 in every joint — *' oh God !" she continued, " the abso- 
 lute charm thou hast, to force me to regret my thought- 
 less words, though wrung from my lips, by thy strange 
 tyranny 1 But, in pity, spare me now, and say no more. 
 Let me depart." 
 
 *' Depart not !" returned Martinuzzi, with the same 
 deep, stern, startling tone, he before adopted. " Go 
 not, at your peril ! Am I not speaking ? Depart, indeed ! 
 Rather, when I utter sounds, kneel down, — down on the 
 hard earth, and strive to catch them, as a thirsty wretch 
 doth spread a mantle to entrap the dew. Garland thy 
 memory, girl, with all the syllables, that grow upon my 
 lips. Oh ! I am dear to thee," and the voice of the 
 cardinal sensibly softened ; "as to the sea-flower is the 
 rock, whereon the blossom clings throughout the storm." 
 
 " Oh ! peace — peace, your eminence, for the love of 
 Heaven !" implored Czerina. 
 
 "Then, never more," continued Martinuzzi, "from 
 this day and hour, never again, young lady, with insolent 
 eye, lip curled in scorn, and wicked brow of smooth and 
 vain imperiousness, dare to call to judgment a thought, 
 a breath of Martinuzzi." 
 
 The poor girl listened, with an air of mingled anguish, 
 and submission. "Spare me!" she said, with faltering 
 voice, at the same time wringing her small, and beautiful 
 hand towards the regent, as if imploring his compassion, 
 " Oh ! spare me, for the present."

 " How soon may I be proud to have you wed ? I tell 
 you, the life of Hungary depends upon these espou- 
 sals." 
 
 "When you will," again gasped out our broken-spi- 
 rited heroine, with a sort of charmed submission. *' By- 
 and-bye." 
 
 There followed a long pause. The colour had faded 
 wholly in the cheek of Czerina, and her feelings were so 
 utterly exhausted, by the very efforts exerted to control 
 them, that, unless the opportune relief of a violent flood 
 of tears, had spent the internal struggle, she felt, she 
 must have gone off into a swoon. Meanwhile, Martinuzzi 
 moved several times, to and fro, in the chamber, absorbed 
 in the musings of his own mind. Once, pausing, he 
 fixed his eyes, for a moment, on the distressed young 
 queen, whose stretched heart-strings seemed ready to 
 crack, asunder. Then he resumed his abstracted walk ; 
 but, presently, a second time halted, and, as he gazed 
 intently, upon the face of the weeping damsel, strange 
 traces of indescribable emotions swept, like shadows, 
 across his pale features. " Fastidious thing !" he mur- 
 mured, in seeming scorn, but with a lip that quivered 
 violently. " 'Tis certain I was born to rule without 
 thee. Well — who knows? — perhaps 'twere better — 
 happier too — poor child !" he continued, relapsing from 
 his previous tone, into one of deep melancholy ;" how 
 lovely ! and how like ! does that fragile frame, that fine 
 and feminine piece of nature promise another Atlas, fit 
 to heave with the heaven of empire ? Can that dainty 
 hand sway a red-hot sceptre ? — that heart, so quick and 
 violent, fluttering like a young bird, at the rustling leaf 
 erewhiles, and which now withers, like the vernal rose, 
 beneath the southern airs * — can that heart endure 
 the weight, the cares of sovereignty ? Oh ! it were bet-

 ing, pale exotic I — far better, I ween, at this instant, to 
 bewail thy blight, in all the buds of thy promise, and all 
 the leaves of thy spring, than have, in after years, to 
 mark thy root unearthed ; and thee, — a monument of 
 wretchedness and blast, — left to be trod down in the 
 highway of the world, or, worse, to witness the slow ri- 
 velling, bending, snapping, at the sapless core, which, 
 under the chilling, formal details of thy gilded destiny, 
 will all but break, yet lingeringly beat on. I have 
 judged ill — mistakenly. Better, a thousand times bet- 
 ter, were it, that God's lightning, had found thee, ere thy 
 birth, than for it now to strike, and sear thy endiademed 
 brow, — to lose thy tiara, were little. — Thy demission is 
 decreed ! but — well — let the infidel rave, and Ferdi- 
 nand fly to arms: I can and must reign, in despite of 
 both, do what they will : the purple cleaves to me, like 
 Nessus' poisoned shirt — but thou! thou weeping pas- 
 sion-bud ! what will become of thee ? Methinks, I now 
 could mourn for thee. But down, my torn heart ! Time 
 and Fate ! — all may yet be well ; and, come what will 
 to me, so that she — yes — yes — ' time and chance hap- 
 peneth to all.'"* Martinuzzi ceased to speak aloud, 
 but his lips still moved. He came up directly in front 
 of Czerina, and gazed on the pale countenance of the 
 overpowered maiden, for more than a minute, with in- 
 tense and mournful tenderness. ^' Adieu, fair lady !" 
 He paused, as a faint smile fell upon his cold features; 
 but the smile was of a serious cast, resembling the in- 
 effectual light, which heaven sends through the stained 
 glass of a cathedral, on some stone effigy within. " Tell 
 Ferraro, when you see him, I knew not, he was envoy 
 from the court of Paphos, — nay, cheer thee ! — If I spoke 
 words that pained, think them unsaid. Jaded and vexed 
 thoughts of these unquiet times fret me, and will some- 
 times strike from out my flinty nature, those sparkles of

 Czerina, making an effort to collect herself, lifted up 
 her blue and beaming eyes ; a melancholy light played 
 on the April heaven of her face, whilst '' the heart's rain" 
 trickled on her guardian's hand, 
 " And pale, through tears suppressed, the mournful beauty smiled." * 
 Repressing her emotion in its crystal sluice, she rose, and 
 in as firm a tone as she could assume, meekly made 
 answer, *' I will consider, sir." 
 
 '' That's a brave lady," rejoined Martinuzzi, lifting up 
 his hands in the attitude of benediction. " Bless thee! 
 Thy scalding tear-drop sears like molten lead ; but sit, 
 and compose thee, daughter." Saying these words, he 
 kissed the forehead of the Queen of Hungary, and, after 
 looking at her again, as if agitated by a variety of con- 
 tending feelings, with slow and pensive step he retired 
 from ihe apartment. 
 
 Left to herself, Czerina gazed intently after him, and 
 the next minute sank motionless in her place. This 
 trying scene with her guardian, so fraught with various 
 and incongruous feelings, left one compounded impres- 
 sion on the mind of our heroine, which was indelible, and 
 might be difficult to parallel. Martinuzzi's heart-quell- 
 ing fury, one instant, and his extreme tenderness, that 
 savoured of an ambiguous sensibility, the next, alike 
 thrilled and startled her. He stood before her, like 
 some tower that Heaven's angry bolts had, at once, burst 
 over and made sacred, and there was something porten- 
 tous in the stern solemnity of his aspect, in the dignified 
 severity of his piercing glance, that awed her very soul ; 
 his allusions to her having shortly to give a king to Hun- 
 gary, in making her aware of the state of her affections, 
 dashed from her mental vision the last scales of inexpe- 
 rience, and brushed away the fresh down of cheerfulness,

 for aye, from her sinless bosom. The bright day-dream 
 that glittered, like the thin autumn film of gossamer in 
 her path, had faded at a touch. Henceforth, for her, the 
 gloss of extreme maidenhood was despoiled of all its 
 magic, and much of its worth. She was no longer heart- 
 whole, and what was more, she could not plead igno- 
 rance of her privation ; the charm of life was fled — her 
 peace of mind was out of her own custody, and depen- 
 dent hereafter on the caprice of another. The self- 
 enduring pride and untainted consciousness of virgin in- 
 tegrity, which had hitherto girt her round, as with a 
 cestus, from this time forwards, relaxed its hold on her 
 thoughts and her belief. In learning to love, she had lost 
 all confidence in her own resources of mind and person ; 
 to outward observance she looked the same, but she felt, 
 that inly it was different, and that the current of her 
 being was changed, — that the romance, — the dreamy 
 halo of her days and nights was clouded, or at least, that 
 a change had come '* o'er the spirit of her dream." She 
 feared she had been premature, and blamed herself for 
 her unfeminine precipitancy, in gifting another with the 
 stewardship of her happiness, ere she had ascertained, 
 beyond a shadow of uncertainty and doubt, that she 
 was the depositary of his. Tis well for the trade in 
 hearts to be free, and without a drawback. " Restric- 
 tions," as Lord Shaftesbury says of wit, *' reduce it to a 
 low ebb," yet the liberality should not be all on one side ; 
 like every other species of free trade, it is all the better, 
 for being reciprocal. The eyes of Ferraro had, undoubt- 
 edly, long since, ''told a flattering tale " to the encoun-

 lovers are proverbial fib-tellers, and credulous must that 
 maiden be, beyond the extensive license of her immature 
 experience, who would read their poetical apocrypha for 
 gospel.

 Ferraro. Now that she was awakened to a precise sense 
 of her sentiments in his behalf, she learned to tremble at 
 her positive partiality, and felt, as it were, disrobed of 
 her very innocence, in having conducted herself with 
 such inconsideration and easy credulity. Thus it always 
 happens, — and therein is involved, a paradox and an 
 anomaly in morals. While we are " fancy free," we can 
 " pass on," through the slippery vale of this phantasmal 
 scene, without doubt or hesitation, in perfect assurance 
 of our own uprightness, and our safety; but the moment, 
 our eyes be opened to the occult meaning and character 
 of what we hear and see, we start at the shadow of our 
 own prurience, and the^ first taint of corruption at our 
 hearts, is the natural beginning of the proprieties and 
 decencies of behaviour. It is a just remark of Swift, and, 
 like the generality of his remarks, characteristic of the 
 dean himself, that " a nice man is a man of nasty ideas ;" 
 it may be analogously affirmed, that every modification 
 or disguise of prudery and sexual delicacy, is only symbo- 
 lical of the moral sense of shame, or the consciousness of 
 some inward infirmity. 
 
 As we have said, Czerina kept herself close for several 
 days, subsequent to the stormy dialogue, recorded in our 
 last pages, and, in the interim, it should seem, her mo- 
 ther, Isabella, came to suspect the rash correspondence, 
 between Ferraro and her daughter. The light of Hea- 
 ven travels not so fast, as the tact of woman on such oc- 
 casions. It is, as if experience, and knowledge, and 
 reason, and calculating thought, and the spirit of pro- 
 phecy were to centre, with incalculable force, in a single 
 apprehension, — were to be all blended, and coiled into one 
 instinct, whose intuitive result, like the brazen serpent in 
 the wilderness, lapped heart, sense, and soul, in its own 
 unerring light. "With hardly any data to go upon, she, 
 nevertheless, caught, from tlie delphi of her breast, the 
 ruin of all those golden fabrics, which possession, 
 passion, and a poetic temperament, seemed to have

 based on adamant, though it was only ** thin air ;" such 
 faith hath first love in his visioned castles ! Ferraro had 
 ceased to join her as was his wont, and when, by chance 
 they met, he was no longer the same ; his manner was re- 
 gulated even to the intonation of his voice. His warmth, 
 the earnestness of his address, the flashes, the irregular 
 outbursts of his genius were either wholly extinguished, 
 or subdued into form, and that liquid eloquence of 
 thought, which ever seemed too over-brimming for mere 
 human utterance to compass and embody, was now 
 shaped and qualified, into the set and conventional tone 
 and diction of society, and immanacled by the proprie- 
 ties of speech, as the wretched victims of Procrustes were, 
 by his inflexible bedstead. It was Ferraro ; but, alas ! 
 the soul, — that which John of Zapola had wanted, that 
 which made Ferraro what he was, in the eyes of Isabella, 
 that emanation of his nature, which was all the diflerence 
 to her, — had departed ; 
 
 " 'Twas Greece, but living Greece no more." 
 What can equal the pangs, the remorse of the heart, 
 which beats under a woman's robe ; or compare to her 
 burning shame at the discovery, when, there, where she 
 had garnered up her affections, she is discarded ? What 
 but her rage, and her revenge ! when she finds, that pos- 
 session, which, with her, had endeared and exalted the 
 object of her attachment, and sublimed the quiet emo- 
 tion of love, into a species of voluptuous idolatry, has, 
 on the other hand, stripped from the passion of her 
 adorer, the desire, which was its principium, its only 
 source, and left the feeble, and satiated inclination to 
 " sink, by slow decay," or to be suddenly strangled by 
 some newer phantasy of the senses, as eternal and as 
 short-lived ; — when she experiences, how light is man's 
 love, how abundant in promise, how futile in perform- 
 ance ! — can we blame her, if, in the thick and midnight 
 darkness, which gathers on her soul, when Etna rages in 
 her heart, and the blood rushes madly, like lava, through

 her veins, she dash down from off the self same altar, 
 where, but a short time since, she had flung the holy in- 
 cense of all g-entle and woman aspirations, the divinity of 
 love, and lighting at his torch the firebrand of Neme- 
 sis, raise that fearful form* on the fragile base ? Thus it 
 fared with Isabella : her passions burned fiercely as ever ; 
 but, alas ! though the flame was blown with sighs from 
 the same source, it was kindled at a different shrine. 
 Venus, indeed, throbbed in every vein,, .she was still the 
 Teraphin, the idol, before which her soul bowed down ; 
 but it was Venus, the goddess of jealousy If At first, 
 however, Isabella refused to listen to the stinging infor- 
 mation, conveyed by that involuntary faculty of which 
 we have spoken ; the revolution of sentiment was too 
 dreadful, — the consequences to her peace too immense 
 and incalculable, to let her, unresistingly, admit the 
 possibility of Ferraro's perfidy : nay, nay, she wrestled 
 against her intuitive suspicions ; she obstinately steeled 
 herself against her own convictions — those exquisite 
 emotions, which were as blossoms in her path, to 
 turn to asps to sting her where she trod ! It could not 
 be,.. it shall not — it must not, . .thus, to the last mo- 
 ment, will we cling to that self-delusion, which makes 
 our moral atmosphere, and, amissing which, we wither 
 and die. We go on, blind and darkling, through this 
 " unsubstantial pageant," and not before the finishing of 
 the secret spell of fate, will the false creation break up, 
 and *' the ignorant fumes, that mantle our clearer rea- 
 son,*' be chased away. Like the predestined solver of the 
 sphinx's snare, we would fain shirk, and hold off* the ora- 
 cles, sprung from earth's womb, whilst, undyingly, they 
 hover over us. We bribe our secret conviction, by some 
 lurking subterfuge of the imagination, and blink the

 rays of truth, as if, like motes of torrid sunshine, by 
 darting on us too directly, they may occasion a brain 
 fever ; and it were better thus, for it were to be uncon- 
 scious, and the old Grecian said right, that not to feel 
 were oft the sweetest being. Even dull insensibility 
 might be deemed a blessing, compared to those soul- 
 torturing pangs,, .those fine hair balancings of jealousy 
 and desire, which oscillated in the bosom of Isabella. 
 The illusive idea of Ferraro was, unto her, as a mirror, 
 which, erst would image miraculous shapes of rosy joys 
 and softest reminiscences, but which now, shivered to 
 fragments, reflected, on every side, in a thousand pris- 
 matic hues, one hellish, multitudinous array of shames 
 and agonies. 
 
 Oh ! wisely did Pausanias afnrm of that fabled fount,* 
 whose property it was, to wash from the hearts of all 
 who laved therein, the most minute particle of passion, 
 and 
 
 " Cleanse the foul bosom of that perilous stuff 
 Which weighs upon the heart," 
 
 that its waters were more precious than gold, since they 
 realized the aim, but not the hope, of philosophy herself. 
 Isabella believed not in such idle legends, neither to her 
 did magic verse or expiatory firef ofler a remedy. For 
 a time, however, she remained in ignorance of the fact 
 of having a rival. She only shook before the wind of 
 vain surmises, which the indifference of Ferraro excited, 
 without apprehending the cause. Well had it been, had 
 she never come to know it, — had she never experienced, 
 like Prometheus, the consequences of filching from 
 heaven forbidden fires, — had she never felt her heart

 chained, by the adamantine bands of necessity, to the 
 cold rock ; or the vulture, jealousy, with ravenous beak, 
 eat into her liver. 
 
 But let us to our tale. A few days following that me- 
 morable night, when the holy edifice of St. Theresa be- 
 came, so to speak, desecrated by that brief colloquy 
 between the queen and her paramour, which Ragotzy, 
 Sigismund, and his keeper, happened to overhear, Isa- 
 bella issued forth, from the portals of the palace, and 
 insensibly directed her meditative steps, towards those un- 
 frequented labyrinths of flowering shrubs, which con- 
 ducted to the fatal pavilion, we have heretofore com- 
 memorated. Of late, Isabella had sedulously avoided 
 taking that walk. The moments of past delight were 
 converted into galling recollections, and the joys, 
 which the scene of assignation conjured up so palpably 
 before her mental vision, were too nearly neighboured 
 by present affliction, for her to endure the retrospect. 
 As she musingly measured one of the sequestered par- 
 terres that, lined out through the royal plaisance, winded 
 beautifully beneath the shades, produced by the com- 
 plicated branches of Linden trees, she caught the voices 
 of two persons conversing not far off, whose indistinct 
 accents whizzed at first upon her ear, with startling ef- 
 fect, and presently shot into her soul, like red-hot mis- 
 siles. The speakers were evidently slowly approaching, 
 from an intersecting path, and, being far from desirous 
 to encounter any one, in her then state of irritable 
 despondency, Isabella slid behind the row of Linden 
 trees, under which she walked, and was immediately 
 lost, beneath the gloom of one of those bosquets, with 
 which the grounds were studded ; the woven leaves and 
 branches, by which she found herself overshadowed, at- 
 tempering the radiance of the noon-day sun into a soft 
 twilight, rendered even his breath cool, and refreshino-. 
 
 In that plot of shrubbery, she prepared herself to 
 crouch, till the persons, she wished to avoid, sliould pass

 by. It might have been a minute ere they came up ; 
 and every tardy step sent gathered agony upon her 
 heart. It was impossible, — and yet, oh G — d ! where 
 sleep thy thunderbolts ? We shall leave it to the ima- 
 gination of the reader, to conceive the consternation of 
 the royal lady, at beholding the youth, she loved above 
 the price of worlds, side by side, with her own daughter; 
 apparently appealing to her, in those animated pourings 
 forth, the wretched listener too well remembered, and too 
 deeply appreciated. All the horrors of despair came 
 thick upon her, but, however terrible the struggle, Isa- 
 bella stood firm. With all the power of her will, she 
 retained the vital principle in, her frame, and though her 
 throat swelled, and her breath came fast, and thick ; 
 though the very life-blood paused in her failing heart, 
 and an ensanguined film darkened her sight, till the 
 earth swam round and round, she would not go raving 
 mad. The topic, which her lover and child were en- 
 gaged in discussing, had evidently no ordinary interest 
 for both. They advanced at that snail-pace, which we 
 have sometime observed to be proper to young people, 
 under certain circumstances ; as, for example, when 
 mammas and papas are a few steps en avant ; and 
 mammas and papas will so crawl and loiter, on these oc- 
 casions, at every turn, that Sisyphus himself, despite his 
 up-hill work, might give them the go-by. The soft, sil- 
 very tones, of the young queen, often died away inau- 
 dibly; but every word, that fell from the lips of her 
 gallant, seemed to be so accurately pitched, as to drop 
 into the ears of Isabella, like that " leperous distilment" 
 with " Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected," that 
 wrought death to the royal Dane. 
 
 With a strong mental exertion, Isabella stirred not from 
 the shrubbery where she couched, but breathed hard, as 
 if her life was struggling to escape through the ribs of 
 flesh, that seemed, to the sufferer, to confine the maniac 
 lieart, like a straight waistcoat.

 " Ferraro," sighed the low voice of Czerina, as she 
 stooped her head forward, under pretence of trifling with 
 some flowers, but, in reality, to allow time for the blush, 
 which the confession of her feelings painted on her 
 cheek, to fade away, — ''you have provoked a truth, 
 which, if, as you say, you love me, — nay, do not answer, 
 till you've heard me out, — you are too rash by half. — 
 I dare not trust you." 
 
 " Oh, my saint \" replied Ferraro, **all impassioned,"* 
 while his ardent love shone unveiled through his bright 
 gaze, — "I will be gentle as the hand I touch ; as mo- 
 derate as the lips, from whose dear motions come scanty 
 sounds of happiness. What have we to fear ? whisper 
 it, my own, my peerless queen ; and I'll repose beneath 
 thy chastening breath, as waves lie still and smooth be- 
 neath the light o'nights, and the distressing winds that 
 chills their countenance. What is to fear ? — art not 
 supreme ? Nay, more, thy hand I 've had assured me, — 
 I ask pardon, — provided thou consented." 
 
 " Ha ! assured thee, indeed ! — By whom, in Heaven's 
 name !" exclaimed the lady, proudly ; " who can have 
 dared ? — was't he ?" 
 
 "He — who?" asked Ferraro, quickly, in an earnest 
 voice. 
 
 " My guardian," said Czerina. 
 
 " Not the regent," answered Ferraro. 
 
 '' Ah ! Antoine, would to God ! it had been," re- 
 turned the royal maid, in a subdued tone ; '' for he, 
 perhaps, — and 'tis of him I'd speak — alas! I cannot." 
 Czerina broke off", and, turning aside, hung down her 
 head in silence. 
 
 "^Sweet lady," cried Ferraro, in a strain of passionate 
 tenderness, " say the worst you know, or think, or shrink 
 from. Am I not near thee ? Nay, tell mc, — dost thou 
 mean sorrow ? — sorrow, methinks, is beautiful to speak, 
 and soft. What evil is to come, that sounds like evil,

 now, in thy tender warning. Oh, it is sweet! — nay, 
 stand thus," he added, taking her unreluctant hand, 
 " I can behold no other sun. I'm blind with gazing, — 
 yet say on. I love to hear of woe, and love thy voice ; — 
 say on." 
 
 " Not a word more ; you make me smile, Ferraro," 
 replied Czerina playfully, fondly pressing the palm of 
 the youth beneath her throbbing bosom, whilst a slight 
 blush, faint as the tint of the youngest leaf of the red 
 rose, giving evidence alike of her transport, and her 
 shame, started to her cheek : " feel what a trembling is 
 in my heart; yet I will not fear; — and, if this be true, 
 you tell me, meseems I can be just. But yet — " she 
 stopped, and heaved, the while, that soft sigh, mellifluous, 
 which is, at once, the breath and evidence of love. The 
 secret volume of intelligence, opened to Ferraro in the 
 electrical movement that preceded, now suddenly closed. 
 
 " Oh, that but ! " he exclaimed, " tell me — " 
 
 *' Well, listen, Antoine," resumed Czerina, stopping 
 the question which was on his lips, still without exactly 
 loosening the imprisoned hand, from its dangerous con- 
 tact; ''I would put the love, you say you bear me, to 
 the test. On my return, after I left you last, I found 
 my guardian seated in the ante-room, that looks upon 
 the orangery." 
 
 ''Whom?" interposed Ferraro. 
 
 " Cardinal Martinuzzi." 
 
 " Noble soul ! " ejaculated Ferraro, with energy. 
 
 Czerina paused, and remained, for a little time, in- 
 tensely thoughtful ; then, withdrawing her hand, she re- 
 joined with somewhat more coldness of manner, and in 
 an altered, and heightened tone; "Even so, even so, 
 sir ; and why not add, right royal ?" 
 
 ** How ! a subject royal ?" 
 
 "A subject! well/' she added, raising her voice, "I 
 would inform you, if you will only hear me, what my 
 guardian threatened — " 
 
 "Threatened, my queen 1"

 " That is the word." 
 
 Czerina again paused, and looked at Ferraro, whose 
 eyes betokened angry surprise. The rose tint, which ex- 
 citation had conjured to our heroine's cheek, died away 
 into paleness. 
 
 *' Am I grown faint, already?" she asked herself. " Let 
 us proceed. The air is close, and the strong beams that 
 dart directly on us, bring a weariness; — it must be that." 
 
 Ferraro was silent; and his fair companion, with 
 clasped hands, thoughtfully followed the direction of the 
 walk. 
 
 *' Only observe, love," she presently subjoined, whilst 
 the faint but meaning smile, that separated her coral 
 lips, spoke a volume of deep feeling ; " how yonder pines 
 fall fast the sick leaves, they have worn to ruin ! Ah, 
 that's a parable !" 
 
 Whatever was the cause, a dark cloud crossed over 
 Ferraro's clear countenance, lately animated with so 
 much fire ; but his lovely companion noted not the 
 change. 
 
 " Lend me your arm, I pray, a few small moments," 
 petitioned the fair maiden ; " this noon-tide sun beams 
 with a too oppressive splendour." 
 
 Ferraro, involuntarily fetched a single breath from the 
 depths of his heart. " I have a life too much," he mur- 
 mured, in a key, which bespoke him most enamoured. 
 
 No less earnest and tender was the suspiration of the 
 royal maiden ; '* Keep it, then, for me, dearest Antoine !" 
 she interjected, between their responsive sighs, casting 
 down her conscious eyes upon the ground. 
 
 A minute more, and the cadence of the lovers — the 
 broken and incoherent evidence of a passion, that could 
 not be silent — died away, like plaintive music, in the 
 distance. 
 
 It was long after they were out of hearing, ere Isabella 
 stepped beyond that leafy screen, where she had lain 
 perdue. Her ever handsome countenance, and royal

 carriage, betrayed no appearance of change ; her bright 
 eye shone out as usual ; no alteration could have been 
 surmised by any one, who had beheld her ; and yet, her 
 nature had just undergone a revolution. Another soul 
 seemed to have passed into her frame. Her first impul- 
 sion, as the fond voices of Czerina and Antoine broke on 
 her ear, had been, to liberate one long, loud shriek, that 
 impotently struggled in her throat ; that natural incli- 
 nation having been, at once, controlled, by a deter- 
 mined tension of mind and frame, strange as it may 
 seem, her senses became wrapt up into a dulness ; while 
 a ravishing serenity,, .a calm, such as, in all her life, she 
 never remembered experiencing before, sunk insensibly, 
 like a sweet sleep, upon her soul. She asked herself, 
 what it meant? She placed her hand upon her heart, 
 and questioned that heart, what had become of its 
 late pains and passions ? She explored, as it were, 
 the dark realms of thought, and would have called, 
 from out their misty cells and caves, into the light of 
 life, those transports of rage and agony, which seemed 
 proper to her hurt pride, and wounded tenderness. 
 In vain ; her pulse beat temperately, her faculties, 
 though hard and cold as flints, were never more 
 perfectly alive, than at that moment. The silver cord 
 felt loosed, and the golden bowl all but broken ; still the 
 fabric of reason was not overturned, and the very in- 
 tensity of her feelings, appeared to wrap her above the 
 sphere of ordinary humanities. The truth was, that, in 
 the depths of her soul, she darkly conceived the nature 
 of the retribution, that, with a sort of silent afflatus, (if 
 we may be allowed such a contradiction of terms) she 
 vowed, and forecasted. The oracular vapour, welling up 
 from the very sources of her being, to inspire her with va- 
 ticinal fury, was, so to speak, the combined orgasm of 
 fibre and feeling, settling into an indistinct, but unques- 
 tioned resolution. The precise interpretation of her in- 
 stinctive augury, was still in the gloom of the future.

 but the exultant idea of vengeance, gave a species of 
 decision to the feelings of Isabella, which she might, 
 otherwise, have sought in vain. She owned an intuitive 
 conviction, that the decretal voice would have early ful- 
 filment ; and this foreshadowing, of an ample and dire 
 atonement, by neutralizing the first violence of her emo- 
 tions, averted an impending exacerbation of passion, 
 which, had it occurred, must have shaken her single 
 frame, like to an earthquake. The relief she experienced 
 was in proportion to the excess of that ebullition of des- 
 pair, which previously threatened. Her nerves were 
 strung for the conflict, when she found, instead of the 
 full flow of an ungovernable wrath, the tide of passion, 
 ebbing in the fibrous ducts and capillary vessels, about 
 her heart. The halcyon peace settled in her bosom. 
 That commensurate revenge, which danced in dim per- 
 spective before the vision of her mind, stilled the fierce 
 commotion within ; and the mere cessation, or rather the 
 fading away of agony, into the remotest depths of her soul, 
 proved, in its effects, a positive gratification. So true 
 is it, that " La jalousie est finie sitot qu'on passe du 
 doute a la certitude." * 
 
 • As she drew near the palace, on her return, she beheld 
 Ferraro, standing listlessly, at the bottom of the large, 
 broad steps, which gave access to the main gateway of 
 the building. On seeing her, he made a motion, as if 
 he purposed turning off", into a more shaded and retired 
 walk. This was a manoeuvre, to which, during the last 
 week, he had, more than once, had recourse ; and, on 
 those occasions, the pride and passion of Isabella, alike 
 deterred her from obviously obtruding on him, her com- 
 pany ; but, at present, by hastening her steps, she en- 
 countered the secretary, as he descended the marble 
 stairs, which terminated the terrace, and thus precluded 
 his effecting his instinctive purpose of avoidance. Ex-

 tending her hand towards him, as they joined company, 
 with a smile of bitter, but hidden import, Isabella was 
 the first to speak. 
 
 " Marc Antoine," she said; and as Ferraro inclined 
 his head, with somewhat of obsequious formality, her 
 curling lip owned a convulsive movement, so evanescent, 
 that however defined and startling while it lasted, it left 
 behind, a doubt whether it may not have been a decep- 
 tion, — '' Marc Antoine, you need not shun me." — Then, 
 after a moment's pause, she added, " You'll pardon my 
 abruptness, sir; did I not behold you awhile ago, in 
 earnest and familiar intercourse with,, . , .with one, whose 
 charms might well stagger a constant heart, and who in 
 this land claims to be first?" The blood-red blush, that 
 suffused the clear brow of Ferraio, was his only answer; 
 but it spoke volumes of feeling. — '' I suspected, when my 
 ears first recognised those eloquent tones, there could be 
 only one topic of sufficient interest to draw forth an 
 effusion of soul, from so susceptible a young gentleman. 
 'Tis clear," continued Isabella, and a smile of bitter- 
 ness came over her, as she said it, " you are in love 
 again, Antoine, — nay, shrink not, man! — We cannot 
 help our loves. My daughter is your aim. I'll swear it 
 is no other." 
 
 " My aim?" repeated Ferraro, with no little embar- 
 rassment. 
 
 "Ferraro," rejoined Isabella, after a pause; " let us 
 have done with subterfuge. By the merest chance, I in- 
 voluntarily overheard your protestation. Come, come — 
 what is there to blush at?" 
 
 For the first instant, the secretary seemed utterly 
 abashed, at hearing so overwhelming an intimation ; then, 
 fancying, he discovered a blandness in the silvery tones 
 of Isabella, he ventured to raise his eyes to the royal 
 lady's countenance, and met with none of those portent- 
 ous clouds, his conscience instinctively had prefigured. 
 His resolution, which had just died away at his heart,

 became immediately resuscitated. He spoke, — " Gra- 
 cious lady, pardon — !" he could say no more. 
 
 " Wherefore, sir ?" demanded Isabella. *' Know," she 
 added, after a pause, " that the infatuation of the woman 
 is merged, henceforth, in the pride of station, and that 
 the contempt of the queen regent unweaves the web, her 
 folly twisted. Besides, owned I any angry sentiment, 
 which it were absurd to imagine, you have contrived to 
 carve for yourself so hard a fate, as might even satiate 
 the mortification of an injured female, — and our sex, you 
 know, are given out to be sore, on these occasions." 
 And such was Isabella's mastery over her features, that 
 she actually conjured a tranquil smile to her beautiful 
 face, as if, in very truth, the current of the time were all 
 unruffled. What she thought, we have no means of pene- 
 trating. What she looked, might be gathered from the 
 response of Ferraro. 
 
 '* Dear madam, this generous oblivion is worthy of 
 your noble nature. But what hard fate can threaten, 
 which thou canst not avert?" 
 
 Isabella was silent for some time, and then said in a 
 low, quiet voice. " Dost thou not love the Lady Cze- 
 rina?" 
 
 " Oh, more than my existence!" replied the impas- 
 sioned youth. 
 
 " Really, sir! more than your existence? So much!" 
 said Isabella, a slight smile curving her coral lips, and 
 somewhat of sarcasm, though hardly perceptible, deep- 
 ening her melodious tones. " If so, I'm sorry." 
 
 '* Oh! wherefore sorry?" inquired Ferraro. 
 
 " Thou but runnest to thy confusion. Marc Antoine," 
 replied the lady; '* there are obstacles, invincible to the 
 match, which you desire." 
 
 *' Name them, madam," exclaimed Ferraro, with 
 breathless anxiety, though in a feeble voice.

 plans of your royal master, by aiding Roccandolph in

 the siege of Buda, — your memory may not reach so far, — 
 but you must have heard of the man." 
 
 " He was a famed soldier, I believe," faintly responded 
 Ferraro. 
 
 " If so, 'tis a boast his son cannot make," rejoined 
 Isabella ; *' but whether so or no, 'twas rank corruption 
 choked his loyalty to the house of Zapola. Wherefore, 
 my daughter, Czerina de Zapola, is to be his son's bride; 
 'tis a thing of course, and suits the times." 
 
 *' Can it not be prevented?" demanded Ferraro, with 
 an inquiring eye. 
 
 "How so!" exclaimed Isabella; "the cardinal has 
 taken his oath of it, — a cardinal's oath! think of that! — 
 Martinuzzi's oath! — prevented indeed!" 
 
 " Art thou not her mother ?" said the secretary. 
 
 " And what is that to Martinuzzi?" returned Isabella, 
 while an astute smile passed over her handsome features. 
 
 " Oh Godl" cried Ferraro. 
 
 The royal lady turned her head aside, to hide the ex- 
 pression of scorn, which she feared, her features too con- 
 spicuously exhibited. Hatred, in that instant, arose in 
 its most viperous shape, fanged by the remembrance of 
 their former love, and envenomed by present contempt. 
 That distillation of her heart,* was, sooth to say, im- 
 mortal, but the peculiar and diabolical appearance, that 
 illumined, whilst it distorted, her countenance, at the 
 moment of its birth, was far briefer than words may paint 
 it. They were silent for awhile. 
 
 " Alas!" exclaimed the young secretary at length, 
 "how I have done you injustice! I was led to believe, 
 you purposed sacrificing the Lady Czerina, to the em- 
 braces of the sultan Solyman. I see 'tis no such thing; 
 and for Pereny — it cannot be; she herself will not con- 
 sent ; she declared to me, she would die first."

 " Die !" repeated Isabella, with solemn significance ; 
 '' and did she talk that? — how fine! — So the word was 
 'die,' sir, was it?" As she thus interrogated, a shade of 
 paleness came over her royal brow, like the almost im- 
 perceptible sign of some inward spasm. 
 
 " Madam ?" said Ferraro. 
 
 " Well," rejoined Isabella, " I see no help; the re- 
 gent is pledged to his kinsman." 
 
 '* He cannot be such a tyrant," cried Ferraro. 
 
 "Tyrant, did you say?" replied Isabella: '"Oh, no 
 tyranny in the least! only he is a man, who, whilst he 
 lives, will not be said nay. Tyrant I what an idea ! It is 
 well, however, that he hears you not ; for myself I should 
 
 be glad, in respect ," she paused a moment, and 
 
 then added in a tone, that thrilled through every nerve 
 of her hearer ; " in respect to the love I bear you, that it 
 were otherwise; but I see no help." At the word ' love,* 
 a slight flush came over the cheek of Ferraro, and he 
 could not help starting, as if the term owned a sound of 
 fear. He looked in the face of the speaker, to ascertain 
 whether any latent meaning lurked in the expression ; but 
 her features were in perfect repose, and her eyes beamed 
 with kind and gentle lustre. 
 
 " Love !" he involuntarily echoed, in a low and hesi- 
 tating tone. 
 
 "Ay, love !" repeated the lady, with unchanging voice; 
 " 'tis a word of many meanings. Ferraro," she presently 
 subjoined, more seriously, " I know not malice. Would 
 
 that Martinuzzi , but the man's an enchanter, and 
 
 holds a spell over your destiny, — so 'tis vain hoping. 
 When was he ever known to change his purpose ? There 
 is no power in speech or prayer, that can prevail with 
 him." 
 
 After a long pause, during which they approached the 
 fatal grotto, Isabella again spoke : " I must here leave 
 you, my friend," she said, " we shall meet again. Ah !

 with a graceful reverence, in the direction of the palace ;

 ceeded to that interview with Abu Obeidah, which we 
 narrated at the opening of this chapter.

 We must recur to a former manuscript, where Martinuzzi, 
 after evincing considerable hesitancy, and trepidation, 
 passed through an inner door of his presence chamber, 
 into an adjoining apartment. This was a lofty octagonal 
 room, stained and delapidated by time, and hung with 
 cobwebs. The compartments were occupied with dark 
 leathern hangings, in tolerable preservation, gilded and 
 stamped, to represent the principal acts of the Apostle 
 of the Gentiles, from his miraculous conversion to Christi- 
 anity, to his decapitation in the capital of the world. It 
 contained two narrow gothic windows, dismantled, and 
 open to wind and weather. These were deeply inden- 
 tured into the wall, and divided by heavy stone shaft- 
 work, into arched compartments, whose interstices were

 nearly choked up, by the luxuriant ivy, and other in- 
 sidious plants, which crept on the outside ; hence, it 
 followed, that a very dubious twilight forced its way into 
 the chamber, even at noon day, but at this hour, the 
 melancholy light seemed only calculated to display, in 
 yet more fantastic and anomalous outline, the embossed 
 figures, that appeared to project in high relief, from the 
 tapestry of the room. A traditionary and bloody tale 
 had been transmitted from generation to generation, and 
 was connected with the history of this octagonal apart- 
 ment, on which account it was devoutly given out to 
 be haunted, and there were not many individuals, living 
 in that castle, endowed with such uncommon courage, as 
 not to tremble and turn pale, at having to cross its 
 threshold, after dusk. 
 
 It was towards the close of day, and the evening set in 
 stormy, with wind and occasional rain, as the regent 
 passed into this room. He was utterly void of the super- 
 stitious fears and prejudices of the times, and if his limbs 
 shook, as he ventured into the comparative darkness, it 
 was with far different apprehensions, than those suggested, 
 by aught belonging to the world of shadows. The breast- 
 plate and helmet of a stranger glittered, in the dim and 
 declining light of evening, by whose aid Martinuzzi was 
 enabled to discern him, in the first instance, standing with 
 his back to the wall, at the extremity of the chamber, 
 but on the entrance of the regent, he came forwards. 
 
 '' I was detained till now," began Martinuzzi, ih a 
 hasty, yet faltering tone, " nor indeed, sir, would I wil- 
 lingly resume the ." He broke off, but almost in- 
 stantly subjoined in a quivering, and ghostly voice — 
 " Have I not been — am I not dreaming still? Let me 
 not babble in my feverish sleep — behold me ! shall I not 
 wake ? Ah ! if I'm indeed awake, there is a word — a 
 
 thought — it cannot be, thou knowest it not — or ." 
 
 He stopped short; the other remained silent. Martinuzzi 
 collecting his breath into one long, but most emphatic

 whisper, added, '' if thou dost know it, say." When this 
 request ebbed from between his clenched teeth, and thin 
 pale lips, Martinuzzi awaited the reply, in the tense and 
 rigid attitude of one, about to hear judgment pronounced, 
 for life or death, instinctively clinging to hope, while 
 shrinking in despair. His head and shoulders were 
 thrown forward, the lower part of his face seemed lost in 
 his breast, his arms and elbows grew to his side, the 
 hands were raised, though not joined, as if in depreca- 
 tion ; his mouth was compressed, as by a vice, his nostrils 
 were distended, and his dark blue eyes were dry, and 
 bursting from their sockets. In this attitude, he remained 
 for some seconds, like a human form, exanimated in the 
 instant of motion, presenting all the appearance of life, 
 but none of its powers. His companion hesitated, ere 
 he slowly pronounced, in a deep voice, the word 
 
 '' TRAITOR." 
 
 The appellation dissolved the charm, which held the re- 
 gent motionless. Darting forward, he exclaimed, in a 
 fierce tone, whilst his eye flashed, as if, like the lightning, 
 it would have struck dead, whom it glanced upon — *' Ah, 
 slave !" Then suddenly stopping short, he added in a more 
 resigned, though somewhat falsetto voice, " yet that is 
 the pass-word, sure enough." 
 
 ''There is a name can reach thee nearer," rejoined the 
 stranger, with unabated boldness, and without noticing 
 his discomposure, " Art thou not a " he paused. 
 
 *' I know what thou wouldst utter," broke in the regent. 
 " When the envoy of Austria entered, thou liadst spoken 
 it — it struck me then, like an icebolt — it was unlocked 
 for. Now, now, I am better armed, sir. Give thy sus- 
 picion, or thy knowledge, — be it more loathsome, than thy 
 own leprosy of mind, — give it the blackest name, thou 
 knowest; I cannot choose but hear thee." There was 
 another pause. 
 
 " Eighteen years gone by," recommenced the stranger — 
 
 " Thou wert an honourable man," again interrupted

 Martinuzzi, *' and wouldst have sunk into the cavernous 
 earth, ere plucked damnation, from the jaws of hell, by 
 such base, mean practices, as since ." 
 
 ^' And eighteen years past, what wert thou, my lord ?" 
 demanded the stranger. 
 
 " Well, well," answered Martinuzzi, " we were friends 
 — I know it — and are so still ; are we not ?" 
 
 '' That have I yet to learn," answered the other. 
 
 There followed a dead silence, of several moments. At 
 length the stranger, with deep organ-like articulation, 
 resumed, '' Thou shrewd impostor !" he began, when the 
 regent interposed — 
 
 '' Wait, I closed the outer chamber, did I not? Go 
 see, if it be secure." 
 
 The man passed into the presence-room. ** You have 
 made all fast within?" asked Martinuzzi, in a voice 
 of forced composure, as the stranger returned. 
 
 *' If both our tongues were in the cannon's mouth," 
 answered the other, " the voice would murmur, like an 
 innocent sleep, beyond that barrier." 
 
 " Come further this way, though," said the regent, 
 speaking in the low, timid, and convulsed tones of appre- 
 hension, whilst his limbs shuddered, as if with some strong 
 internal anguish — ^'deeper, sir, into the Jieart of rest. Let 
 us have no society, but our own terrors. Lightly ! so, 
 lightly ! why," he added, more abruptly, '^ why look ! you 
 have not closed the door ." 
 
 The stranger shut to the inner portal, and again ap- 
 proached where the regent stood, at the upper end of the 
 apartment. 
 
 " So then," began Martinuzzi, '^ let us say no more — 
 of this to-morrow. Death ! you know not how I loath 
 this conversation. Well, what is to be ?" 
 
 '' Thou dost mock the heart of this fond country, with 
 a lying hope," began the stranger. 
 
 Martinuzzi advanced a few steps forward, clenching his 
 hands — *' Thou said'stas much erewhiles," he exclaimed :

 " why repeat thy words? Speak to the point, prithee— 
 this is no news." 
 
 " None to us— right," answered the other ; ** but what 
 will the world say, think you, if men knew the love she 
 bore thee,,, she, the betrothed of Peter Count Pereny, 
 who was the late king's sister — how cunningly !" 
 
 *' Talk no more on't," interrupted Martinuzzi, with an 
 unnatural and hushed stillness of articulation, " or do not 
 talk so loud." 
 
 ^' There's no soul by, to hear us," remarked the stranger 
 coolly. 
 
 " One doth hear!" exclaimed the cardinal, fixing his 
 eye, now lit with a preternatural glare, on the counte- 
 nance of the man — ''One — I sir, look to it; now God 
 forgive me ! in truth, you know not what you prate 
 about." 
 
 *' You do forget yourself to say so," replied the stranger. 
 '' My lord, in the first place, give me back my brother, 
 Albert of Eissenburg, by thy hands or by thy orders, done 
 to a dishonest death, for that thou hadst good cause to 
 fear, he would divulge certain bloody passages, betwixt 
 thee and the Princess Beatrice." 
 
 " Speak lower, or (good God !) the venom of asps is 
 on thy tongue," exclaimed Martinuzzi. His articulation 
 was broken, and his hands were compressed together, 
 with fearful energy. " I tell you, Eissenburg," he pre- 
 sently added, more calmly, '' your brother was murdered, 
 if murdered he be, as you say, neither with my know- 
 ledge, nor by my connivance. Let his blood lie where it 
 may — my soul disclaims it." 
 
 '' I believe you not, my lord," answered Eissenburg ; 
 " your agent was in company with the assassin, the same 
 
 who , and that is what brings me hither. My house 
 
 is desolate — my child came not forth to meet me, on my 
 return from prison ; I want her back again. Restore 
 my heart to me, by giving Veronica to my arms — I'll

 well guess at. I have my brother's confession, and I 
 have still remaining, of the packet, one document, which, 
 by good fortune, had never been deposited in the window 
 recess, and so was never stolen thence. That document — 
 I know its contents — the confession of Alicia !" 
 
 " Ay," said Martinuzzi, and his cheek assumed a hue, 
 more cadaverous than before, *^ it is a tragic episode in a 
 deplorable history ; but I declare to you, Eissenburg," 
 he added, in a firmer voice, and with earnest solemnity, 
 " by Him, who sees our thoughts as plainly as our faces ! 
 my heart's as innocent as infant's sleep. As respects 
 the lady Veronica's absence," proceeded Martinuzzi, 
 after a pause, " it was from yourself, this afternoon, I 
 first came to learn, either that, or your brother's mur- 
 der." 
 
 *' Where is my child, then V cried Hubert, passion- 
 ately ; '^ but I see through your wiles. In default of 
 King John's issue, she is the rightful heir of Hungary. 
 You remembered her claims well, and pondered over 
 them long ; you imprisoned the father, the more readily 
 at once to seize upon the daughter, and silence the bro- 
 ther. But, if you have smeared your soul in her true 
 blood — if your safety be trenched, as you suppose, in 
 her innocent life — I'll secure vengeance ; tho', I ween, 
 she be not the only princess of this ill-fated land, whom 
 the ambition of a hypocritical priest has condemned to a 
 sudden, and inexplicable fate. Have you sent my child 
 to seek the shade of Beatrice ? Have you again rifled the 
 living tabernacle of the soul, and left me, in the stead of 
 my Veronica, a low voiceless grave V 
 
 " By all we mutually believe in, I protest to you — 
 No!" replied Martinuzzi. 
 
 " But am I weak enough to credit you, with this 
 damning document fresh in my remembrance, and after 
 that lady's unnatural sacrifice, and my brother's cruel 
 murder? He fell in his endeavour to preserve my child- 
 then say, where hast thou bestowed her ? Which of the

 vninisters of your despotism have you let loose on her — 
 contamination, imprisonment, or massacre ? Foul stain 
 to the purple which thou sportest ! Come, confess ? We 
 are alone — behold! I am not here unarmed." — Vicchy 
 drew his ponderous two-handed spear, and half leaned 
 on it, as on a staff. 
 
 The shades of evening were now fast deepening into 
 the darkness of night, and the feeble twilight was just 
 able to endow, with congenial life and motion, the incon- 
 gruous and uncertain objects, which tapestried this apart- 
 ment, without having sufficient power to dispel, or enable 
 the startled sight to correct, the illusions, which it con- 
 jured. Forms of limbs, and human faces, came out, as 
 it were, from the wainscot. On every side, in this atmo- 
 sphere of superstition, some shadow seemed to hover, or 
 gigantic figure projected itself; whilst the misty illumi- 
 nation, which was now admitted, through the medium we 
 mentioned, broken by the luxuriant bryony, which ran 
 mantling, amid the ribbed traceries of the arched case- 
 ments, at once gifted lifeless matter with vitality, and 
 gave a corporeal shape to the miscreations of the fancy. 
 It almost seemed, as if the apartment grew populous with 
 animated beings, and, as cloud after cloud drifted along 
 the semicircle of the moon, now plunging surrounding 
 objects into a shadowy mass, and anon permitting a 
 melancholy, and uncertain gleam of light, to fall full 
 through the shafted windows of the old building, shift- 
 ing forms would extend their limbs, and dim fronts 
 stretch forth their hands, and all would assume the vari- 
 ous attitudes of prayer, or imprecation. There was one 
 group, which, even more strikingly than the other figures, 
 seemed to be actuated by this locomotive faculty. The 
 subject was that of St. Paul, when, with lips touched by 
 the seraph, with tiie living coal from God's altar, he indi- 
 cated the Divinity, in the schools at Athens : it was done 
 as large, or larger than life. The principal character 
 was elevated in the foreground of the piece, within a foot

 of the spot, where Hubert, with his right hand upon the 
 hilt of his sword, was stationed. The apostle had been 
 pourtrayed with one foot advanced, and his finger ex- 
 tended towards the inscription, Ayj/worw QeCj, while his 
 floating toga was so contrived — or else the flickering 
 gleams, that shot between the passing shadows produced 
 the effect — that it waved along with the motion of his 
 arm, and almost seemed to flutter in the intermitting 
 light of the moon, or rustle in the nig'u v/jnd, whose 
 every faint and passing murmur became plaintively 
 audible, as it swept the mantling foliage round the 
 mouldering citadel. 
 
 During Vicchy's last rapid speech, St. Paul had more 
 than once let loose the ample gathering of his cloak, 
 and the drapery seemed to be borne on the air, and, as it 
 were, to spread itself towards the speaker. At the close, 
 so wonderful was the conjuration of the artist, or else so 
 powerful the illusion of the instant, the embodied figure 
 of the saint appeared to descend, and to emerge into the 
 void space, from out of the crowd of sophists and rheto- 
 ricians. Martinuzzi had planted himself betwixt the two 
 casements, where darkness rendered it difficult to distin- 
 guish his person. " Eissenburg," he replied, at length, 
 " you have heard me solemnly protest, I know nought of 
 the lady Veronica — I repeat my asseveration. I trust 
 she still exists, but — " 
 
 "She lives!" broke in a miraculous, and hollow 
 whisper, close at the ear of Vicchy. Startled, he turned 
 his head, in the direction of the voice, and his dilated 
 glance lit on the wan countenance, the gleaming eye, 
 that appeared to roll with a changeful and uncertain 
 brightness, and the inspired lips of the apostle, dilated, 
 as if pouring out the thunder of his eloquence, amidst an 
 audience of Pagan philosophers. Vicchy gazed, and gazed, 
 and he fancied he perceived the sainted being separate 
 himself from the canvass. The longer his overstrained 
 eye rested on the figure, the more firmly he became per-

 MANUSCRIPT XIX. 221 
 
 suaded of the reality of the miracle. The mind of Hubert 
 was so fettered in the anomalous trammels of his servile 
 faith, and so deeply saturated with the superstitious dew 
 of his corrupted worship, that miracles and visions (inci- 
 dent to the adoration or intercession of the saints,) sprung 
 up in his belief, as in a hot-bed, and, like noxious weeds, 
 choked with their rank luxuriance, the growth, at once, 
 of sound reason, pure religion, and common sense. 
 
 Vicchy was too good a Catholic to be taken by sur- 
 prise, and although he felt a little awed, yet a miracle 
 surely was in the course of nature, or it would not be of 
 such frequent occurrence. His imagination, naturally 
 apt to distance itself from the material world, was pre- 
 pared, by a long course of superstition, to admit, and to 
 sustain, the visible action of the Deity ; and wherefore, 
 he internally argued, should he feel alarmed ? 
 
 "Whom, Eissenburg, have we in the room? — whose 
 was that voice ?" inquired Martinuzzi, in a low tone. 
 But Hubert heeded not the question. Each faculty of 
 his soul was concentrated in one wild imagination ; his 
 legs shook, the spear dropped from his relaxed hold, and 
 he sunk in genuflexion before the incarnate spirit of the 
 saint, who had thus thrown off the shroud of his immor- 
 tality, to hold with him personal communication. He 
 prayed earnestly, and gazing on the apostle, in the full 
 assurance of implicit faith, implored to be made acquainted 
 with the fate of his child ; and engaged, in a faltering 
 voice, provided the saint vouchsafed a favourable re- 
 sponse, he would have a rich altar dedicated to his parti- 
 cular honour, in the cathedral of St. Theresa, *' that is," 
 added the devout noble, as the recollection of his limited 
 means struck him, " whenever my attainder shall be re- 
 versed." Hubert conceived, he heard with his ears the 
 acceptance of his vow. 
 
 "Thy child liveth," answered St. Paul ; or, if the 
 words were not uttered by him, it was at least certain,

 the solemn annunciation proceeded from the direction, 
 where the apostle stood. 
 
 Again silence ensued, which Vicchy presently broke. 
 '^ Is her liberty restricted ?" he demanded, in a shudder- 
 ing tone. There was no replication for nearly a minute. 
 The form of the sacred visitant, without being so de- 
 tailed as to intimate itself distinctly, nevertheless ex- 
 panded, in the eyes of the rapt querist ; and the thick 
 clouds, that now crossed the moon's path, cast the Areo- 
 pagus, and every other scriptural piece, which decorated 
 the compartments of the chamber, into dim confusion. 
 
 " Her person," answered the angelic being, in a low, 
 emphatic voice, " is in durance, and her mortal life, 
 perhaps, at hazard." 
 
 " Hal" exclaimed Hubert, "and from that traitor 1 
 Is it the divine will, I sacrifice him, where he stands?" 
 No sooner had he uttered these words, than, in tones 
 pitched higher, and sounding more awful, the answer 
 hurtled on the air, as if the disembodied principle, syl- 
 labling it, hovered at his shoulder. 
 
 The organic breathing, which rang in the ears of Hu- 
 bert, he remembered but too well. He recognised in- 
 stantly the accents, and the express words of the awful 
 prohibition to unclose the packet, which had electrified 
 him, on that memorable night, when he was dragged 
 from his lost Veronica, and consigned to prison ; and, if 
 the sounding forth were from heaven, so, also, '' suddenly 
 there shined round about him a light from heaven ;" for, 
 at that instant, the pallid planet of night burst from be- 
 hind the intervening rack, and slanted her soft, and 
 ghostly radiance, into the chamber. Thus spoke the 
 immortal voice: — "Would you destroy body and 
 
 SOUL ? officious fool ! THE ReGENT OF HuNGARY IS 
 
 innocent SEEK TO KNOW NO MORE." 
 
 Vicchy was transfixed for several moments to the spot, 
 where he knelt, confounded with horror, as, in the first 
 few words of the sentence, his memory recalled the ener-

 getic style of that script, whose language had been cha- 
 ractered in blood. At length, slowly raising himself to 
 his feet, Vicchy looked towards where Martinuzzi re- 
 mained, an apparently petrified auditor of the colloquy, 
 between him and the apostle. Although the regent's 
 figure was almost undistinguishable in the shade, it now 
 appeared, on closer examination, that both his hands 
 were clasped against his face. There was a long and 
 dead silence, in that moonlit chamber. Vicchy was the 
 first to renew the discourse. " My lord," he said, '* you 
 are acquitted;" — then, after pausing, in vain, for a 
 reply, he continued, — " so far, at least, as respects my 
 child ; but " Here, he made another pause. 
 
 Alas ! how strange and inconsistent are the workings 
 of the human mind ! How subtle and complicated is 
 natural bias, in the analysis of human feelings ! And 
 what an enigma is contained in the entangled sources, 
 and latent springs of human character and conduct,., 
 an enigma, which probably, not the profoundest re- 
 searches of philosophy will ever enable us to solve. 
 
 Whilst Vicchy considered Martinuzzi, as the destroyer 
 of his daughter, his language, as we have seen, was the 
 effusion of virtuous indignation, and honest nature im- 
 pressed her seal on the very intonation of his voice, im- 
 pelling his courage, and dictating his sincerity. But the 
 moment, his parental disquietude was set at rest, his 
 habitual tergiversation returned in force. The natural 
 sense, with which the father, for a brief interval, en- 
 dowed the man, gave place to that distorted wisdom and 
 crooked policy, which, with Vicchy, was its usual sub- 
 stitute. More shrewd than intelligent, more daring than 
 determined, the unstable mind of the magnat was not 
 nicely balanced, by substantial and compreliensive rea- 
 son, and neither was the fluctuating scale, that regulated 
 his conduct, inclined at any time, by the insensible 
 operation of principle, or by the more stubborn inter- 
 vention of conscience. The one was superseded by the

 casuistry, induced by the habit of confession, and the 
 obligation of penance, and the authority of the former 
 had been early sacrificed to that convenient, but per- 
 nicious sophism, which taught indifferently, that any 
 means, however vile, were sanctioned by the end, and 
 that the end might be sanctified by the means. '' But," 
 proceeded Vicchy, " I have another account to settle 
 with your highness." Again he paused. 
 
 Martinuzzi let fall his hands, and looked up. " Well," 
 said the regent, in a voice of hollow strength. 
 
 " Is it your purpose," rejoined the noble, with dogged 
 determination, " to seat the lawful heir of Hungary on 
 the throne of these realms ?" 
 
 " Whom, am I to understand, by that phrase ?" asked 
 Martinuzzi. 
 
 " My daughter, the Lady Veronica," was the reply. 
 
 " Indeed ! how know you that ?" rejoined the regent, 
 in a voice which, although broken, may have had some- 
 thing of sarcasm, perceptible in the tones. 
 
 *' Oh ! I know,'' answered Vicchy, significantly. 
 
 ** Thou dost indeed !" returned Martinuzzi, with the 
 galling emphasis of stern reproof, and a flash of wither- 
 ing scorn shot from his lambent eyes ; — '' thou dost 
 indeed, because thou art a thing, whose virtue is thine 
 ignorance ! Oh ! thou art one, sir, whose highest excel- 
 lence is that restless infirmity, which will peer into 
 forbidden things, though the earth were rent to appal 
 you^ and fiends from the abysm cried, — Hold !" 
 
 '* Be it so," answered Vicchy, proudly; ''let the 
 centre labour with earthquakes, and summon every con- 
 federate in the infernal pit to aid you ! it shall not 
 shake me : I am thrice armed. But, good my lord car- 
 dinal," he continued, in a lighter strain, '' 'tis well for 
 you, your principles do not make it needful, you should 
 square your conduct to your vocation. For myself, un- 
 derstand, your eminence, my lamp, so bright of yore, was

 found it ; — it shall serve my turn, though I asked no 
 leave. My paths are plainer than the sun's, — I have 
 committed myself too providentially in this, to fear the 
 consequence. My ignorant sin turns out a substantial, 
 though tardy justice; and, when reproach is flung on 
 me, from lips like yours, excuse me, if I say, I cannot 
 feel it." 
 
 " Go on," said Martinuzzi, in a voice of studied com- 
 posure. 
 
 '* There was a packet, — (no matter how it came into 
 my hands), — there was, I say, for where it is now I 
 cannot tell," said Vicchy ; — '' that packet I opened." 
 
 ^' You did sir, you basely did !" exclaimed Marti- 
 nuzzi. 
 
 ** I opened it," continued Vicchy, without regarding 
 the prelate's interruption, " and, by favour of the Virgin, 
 one document yet exists. When I heard its contents, I 
 learned to look upon my fault with mercy. I trusted, 
 on hearing it bore reference to your highness, to scan 
 the patriot and the statesman ; — but, ha ! my lord, I lit 
 upon the traitor !" 
 
 A suffocating sensation stifled the sigh, Martinuzzi 
 would gladly have heaved. He faintly smiled, and said, 
 *' Dost dare, for thy miserable life? — but take heed, 
 take heed, 1 say !" 
 
 '' Thou mayst be mighty in thy fame, my lord, and 
 powerful, but truth is ever armed," returned Vicchy : 
 *' yet were I loath to hurl thee from thy greatness — abdi- 
 cate thine usurped estate — transfer the sceptre of Cze- 
 rina into the hands of Veronica. Adjust our differences 
 in this way, and the story of your offences, and the 
 wrongs of the house of Zapola, shall never rise to mar 
 that splendid page in our country's annals, which records 
 the deeds of Martinuzzi."

 *' And really, Eissenburg, cannot you tax our boun- 
 ties more highly ?" said the regent, in the calm accents 
 of haughty irony ; ''why, sir, what you require of me 
 is a mere bagatelle. Delegate to you our supreme au- 
 thority, — we are grown incompetent — 'tis too weighty for 
 us. Wrest from our hands the barren sceptre of the 
 reigning queen, and turn over the bauble to your daugh- 
 ter, who will graciously present her highness with a 
 distaff in exchange ! You ask too little, sir ; you re- 
 quest, I would substitute my bonnet for the diadem ? 
 Alas ! God knows," said Martinuzzi, interrupting him- 
 self with deep feeling, " my aching temples would be all 
 the lighter for it; but, in faith," he subjoined, after a 
 short pause, and with something like a smile on his pale 
 features, " it was written in heaven, that I was to be 
 King of Hungary ! You meant to dethrone the Lady 
 Czerina — but I have the start of you, my lord. What 
 you dared conceive, I have already compassed." 
 
 Vicchy preserved silence, but his uneasy gestures, 
 the knitting of his brow, the gnawing of his nether 
 lip, and, more particularly, the malign twinkle of his 
 snake-like eyes evinced plainly, that his thoughts were 
 perplexed, and that he was meditating some further 
 tortuous proposal. 
 
 The regent presently resumed the discourse, in a calm 
 and measured voice. " We will have this outlawry of 
 yours reversed, my good lord," he said ; " and, in other 
 respects, strive to redress the injuries of fortune ; but, 
 hereafter, when we see you, with your fair daughter, at 
 court, which will be a heartfelt satisfaction to us, I must 
 interdict the subject of this hour's converse." 
 
 After hesitating for an instant, Vicchy replied, — " You 
 will let the reversionary right of the Lady Veronica be 
 publicly recognised." 
 
 ** That may not consist with our conscience, my lord," 
 observed Martinuzzi, — " no kingdom can your child 
 ever inherit."

 " Wherefore, your highness ?" demanded Vicchy, in 
 short and impatient tones. 
 
 *' For one, under the ban of the church, to reign over 
 a catholic people, is unlawful ; — the lady is heretic." 
 
 '^ Nay," exclaimed Vicchy, passionately, " this pal- 
 tering is no less hypocritical, than gross ; but it is futile. 
 How you learned, that my Veronica is unhappily — " he 
 paused, ere he subjoined, in a subdued voice — '* a he- 
 retic, I cannot divine ; but, since none, besides your 
 eminence, knows of her heresy, it were no impossible 
 task, methinks, to hide it from the world." 
 
 " My conscience, my lord," answered Martinuzzi, 
 "will not permit of this interested composition. The 
 trail of the serpent has already slimed over the fair land 
 of the Magyar. It is my duty to stop the disease, instead 
 of conniving at its diffusion." 
 
 " I see through your highness's purpose," exclaimed 
 Hubert, ''and know well, whom you would desire to 
 reign, after you, in Erdeiy ; but, rather than permit it, 
 I'll issue forth into the public streets, and blow about 
 your guilt." He paused, and then added, significantly, 
 " I have that letter still !" 
 
 " Ha ! I remember," said Martinuzzi, " so, where is 
 it? — give it me,, .to read.'' 
 
 Vicchy was silent. 
 
 " Nay," added the regent, "I'll return it to you, how- 
 ever shameful the means, by which you first became pos- 
 sessed of it. I would merely cast mine eyes over it." 
 
 " I would not care, to trust the document in your high- 
 ness's hands, were it still in mine own," replied Vicchy ; 
 " but, in honest truth, I have transferred it into other 
 custody." 
 
 Lividly glared Martinuzzi's eye, in the semi-obscurity 
 of the apartment. " Hell ! and eternal shame !" he burst 
 out, breathing short, and stamping on the ground. 
 " Vicchy ! — vacillating driveller ! What have you 
 done with Alicia's confession ? — speak, slave !"

 Before so unlooked-for a boiling of indignation, tlie 
 weaker nature of Eissenburg succumbed and trembled. 
 He spoke not. It may be observed, that the phrenzy of 
 minds, of powerful and commanding calibre, will commonly 
 abash, in its paroxysm, the more feeble passions of less 
 exalted characters, as the foaming cataract, thundering 
 down the kromacks, soon engulphs and overpowers, in its 
 descent, the minor torrent, which may, at first, have 
 raged by its side. Vicchy, on witnessing the ungovern- 
 able fury of Martinuzzi, deemed it most prudent to pre- 
 serve silence. 
 
 " Why don't you answer, sir?" exclaimed the regent, 
 his eyes glancing with impatience : " unto whom have 
 you given my letter ? — earthquakes quiver in my flesh — 
 speak, as you hope for mercy." 
 
 ** My lord, if I must needs own the fact," replied 
 Vicchy, with some hesitation, and recoiling a step before 
 the forward movement of the prelate; '* I entrusted it, 
 but only for awhile, to Luke Swartz." 
 
 ''To him, hey?" returned Martinuzzi, his haggard 
 brow relaxing from its previous workings. " When, 
 prithee ? — and what opportunity had you ?" 
 
 Vicchy explained the circumstance of his encounter- 
 ing Swartz on the ramparts. 
 
 •'Ah, I deserve it all," remarked the regent, more 
 composedly, though still with bitterness, and he turned 
 away. 
 
 From the comparatively calm tone, in which these 
 words were enunciated, Vicchy perceived, that the im- 
 pending storm had blown over, and at once he fell back 
 into his habitual character. " My lord," he said, after 
 long mutual silence, " I will allow you a month to con- 
 sider of my proposal, that, upon your demise, the sole 
 right to the throne of this kingdom, vest in my daughter, 
 if, then, your highness decline closing with ray terms, 
 you may assay, to your immortal infamy, how much

 longer this wretched land will bear with the sway of an 
 homicide." 
 
 Like one, on the verge of a precipice, awakened 
 to a sense of his danger, was the start of Martinuzzi. — 
 " Madman !" he cried, " in thy tongue millions of ad- 
 ders hiss ! Will you not hold your peace ?" He strode, 
 or rather violently tottered, across the chamber, and 
 stood, as if struck speechless, shivering in every vein ; his 
 nether jaw, indeed, moved convulsively, but his lips were 
 dry as ashes, and no articulate sound breathed from 
 them. At length, conquering his emotions, he thus, with 
 startling rapidity of utterance, delivered himself, — *' We 
 were talking, sir, upon what topic? — Quick, where was 
 our converse ? — Now, I am gone, sir ! — what was it ?" 
 
 " Yet awhile," began Vicchy, but Martinuzzi pro- 
 ceeded, in a quick sufibcated tone. 
 
 ** My lord, well — I know — somewhat you said — His 
 past. What was't, I ask again — assist me.*' 
 
 " You will please, at your peril, to acknoAvledge and 
 proclaim the Lady Veronica heir of the monarchy," 
 replied Vicchy, perhaps, with the more determination, 
 that he considered the starts and discomposure of the re- 
 gent, as symptoms of his expiring resolution, and fancied, 
 he discovered a yielding and faltering of purpose, in the 
 confusion of mind, and disordered senses, which the man- 
 ner and language of Martinuzzi manifested. 
 
 The indignant prelate gasped for breath. " That 
 word, Eissenburg, has made an end," presently broke 
 from his convulsed lip ; then, suppressing his emotions 
 with difficulty, with desperate rapidity he went on. 
 '* The sun is down, sir, I must be stirring — 'tis the hour 
 of prayer — behold me!" and he stood up erect, in form 
 and posture proudly eminent. '' Behold me, how I stand, 
 unmoved, and yet it must have been !" He paused, but 
 shortly, again proceeded, abruptly : " we purpose, to- 
 morrow, my lord duke, exchanging our mitre for a helm,

 and hope to inflict a sort of unpleasant surprise, upon 
 our enemies, in which your co-operation (judging of 
 your abilities from our last argument) must be invalu- 
 able. You shall bear command, fitting your rank, and 
 possibly, you will find me better tempered by to-morrow, 
 when we will adjust our differences — if any be. This 
 way, my lord duke." The regent passed through the 
 door of communication, into the presence-chamber, fol- 
 lowed by Vicchy. The moon diffused her mellow light 
 over the whole of this apartment, and Vicchy might 
 distinctly discover the ghastly visage of the cardinal ; — 
 his wild straining eyes gleamed, with a horrible and va- 
 cant stare, and every muscle of his face seemed contorted, 
 with agony. He approached close to Vicchy, and, front- 
 ing him, where he stood, glared fixedly on his counte- 
 nance for above a minute, all the while apparently striv- 
 ing to speak, but no articulation answered his will. At 
 length, the burning tide of passion receding in his throat, 
 he found utterance. " Great God, forgive me !" he eja- 
 culated, and then he again stopped, and gasped a long 
 trembling breath, ere he continued, with intense and wi- 
 thering solemnity. " Man !" he said, " hadst thou 
 come sightless into thy wretched existence, as blind, God 
 in Heaven knows, thou art in spirit ! — or else, wert dumb, 
 as in thy soul thou indeed seem'st, to all good purposes ; 
 this conference had never been — then these passages, 
 that have just transpired had never chanced — and, 
 
 then, my lord— but • " Martinuzzi's voice faltered ; 
 
 he paused for a second. The deadly and appalling calm, 
 which sat upon his countenance, but the moment be- 
 fore, was succeeded by that tempest of the features, in 
 which every nerve seemed at work — he set his teeth hard, 
 and both hands gradually tightened on the steel armlet 
 of Vicchy, grasping him firmly, like a manacle, or, we 
 would say, with the Herculean force of partial insanity. 
 " Devil !" he shouted, suddenly altering his tone, in his 
 uncontrollable agitation, '' thou hast made me scorch

 to the full height of a blazing calenture, spectres and 
 bloody deeds, like tresses of dancing fire, float round me 
 and about me, and I, myself, am all made up of fire. — 
 Ha ! that gash ! — thou well mayst shudder, when bloody 
 forms are round. I cannot bear it — avoid my sight ! — 
 nay, then, for your own sake, — without reply. The 
 thought, I'm apt to practise, I may else have to repent 
 me. — 'Tis wild fire here, that only blood can quench — 
 go — I'd pray — Ave Maria ! So, I am calmer now — 
 your pardon, sir, we'll speak of this to-morrow, as I 
 said — hence — begone slave! from my sight! — and, 
 suddenly, and wisely, hear you ? (and Martinuzzi 
 stamped violently) 'tis for your life, do you understand 
 — farewell !" On saying these last words, in a low in- 
 tense voice, Martinuzzi suddenly relinquished his iron 
 hold of Vicchy, and hurriedly staggered to unclose the 
 door. For awhile his nervous agitation impeded his ob- 
 ject; but, having succeeded, with his hand he haughtily 
 waved Vicchy from his presence, who departed in si- 
 lence, not a little relieved at the termination of a confe- 
 rence, so fraught with ofience and danger.

 The sun had clomb high in the heaven, when the figure 
 of a solitary horseman was seen wending his way, over the 
 low and thickly wooded flats, through which the auri- 
 ferous river Marosh, near its confluence with the Theisse, 
 winds its earliest course. The narrow, and nearly un- 
 defined by-path the traveller had chosen, skirted the very 
 edge of the stream, the direction of which, however in- 
 constant, seemed to regulate his route. Occasionally, 
 indeed, he would cut across the sort of Isthmuses, caused

 by the wooded Peninsulas, which frequently indented 
 'the waters, but never so far lost sight of the narrow line 
 of track, he followed, as to diverge into the public road, 
 as in courtesy we are bound to style a broken earthy 
 thoroughfare, which, at greater or less distance from the 
 shore, preserved a parallelism with the course of the 
 aforesaid river. Now, as the art of road-levelling was 
 little understood in Transylvania at the time we treat 
 of, the route in question, appeared almost as faithful 
 to the lineaments of grace, as its more natural and 
 noisier elder. But, malgre the monstrous '' can ties it cut 
 out," and the other indifferent attempts at a " fine shape," 
 it must be confessed, after all, that it " imitated nature 
 most abominably." Whether our traveller entertained 
 any fancy of this sort, we will not pretend to say. We 
 infer, however, he held in small admiration, the meanders 
 of the Mac Adams of the day, for whenever the public 
 path made any sudden advances, towards where the 
 marosh laved, with alternating dash, the frail flowers and 
 tall spear grass, that enamelled its banks, he invariably 
 clapped spurs to his steed, and held on at a brisker pace, 
 till the current and the high road, had either parted 
 company of their own accord, or been again divorced, by 
 the swelling vineyards, or by thick and overlianging 
 groves of the alder and willows, or by broad and inter- 
 posing meadow ground, enclosed with hedges of thorn, 
 now checkered by the rich and golden tinge of autumn. 
 The martial garniture of the equestrian was complete, 
 but his bearing hardly corresponded with his equipment. 
 Indeed, his dwarfish insignificant figure, showed con- 
 spicuously to disadvantage, in contrast to the barbed 
 destrier, he bestrode. It even seemed, as if the animal 
 himself entertained a sort of contemptuous opinion of his 
 rider, since he champed and curvetted, as though, " smel- 
 ling the battle afar oft', the thunder of the captains, and 
 the shouting," he longed for his pride to be reined in, by 
 an abler arm. The traveller's beautiful muster-piece, or

 pelisse of sheep-skin, concealed most of his other attire, 
 and fell in ample folds over his shoulders, mingling with 
 the embroidered housing, that enveloped his horse's flanks. 
 Of his visage, little could be seen; but his sunken features, 
 and deep twinkling eyes showed horribly, under the 
 hollow helmet. Our equestrian, having journeyed since 
 sun-rise, through a dreary waste of pusztas or cattle 
 farms;* the lagging pace of his steed, and other indica- 
 tions of a carnal nature, more proper to himself, rendered 
 very welcome the appearance of a straggling village, 
 situated less than a league in advance of where he rode. 
 It was composed of low clay huts, starting so few feet 
 above the surface of the ground, that nothing but the 
 issuing steam and the little clouds of light smoke, as- 
 cending in graceful spires from their several fissures in 
 the earth, could have distinguished the settlement, at any 
 distance, from the soil upon which it stood. 
 
 The Troglodyte* hamlets, which now opened on the 
 view, have been long effaced, but for the last century, 
 a Saxon town, bearing the name of Mirizlo, and nearly 
 covering their site, forms the prominent feature in the 
 surrounding landscape. These habitations, excavated 
 in the declivity of a gentle eminence, extending to the 
 very edge of the rivulet, were intermixed with, and 
 surrounded by mulberry and maple trees, whilst the sere 
 branches of the acacia waved tremulous and pale, over 
 the mossy roofs. On every side, for several leagues,

 of green savannah intervened, commonly supplying a 
 most abundant crop for the droves of milch buffaloes, 
 and herds of Turkish swine, that were there grazing. With

 sets, and younglings of the forest. But it is now some weeks 
 since wild and untrodden flowers of any description, 
 wasted their luxuriance on the dim forest air. No more 
 the pale wood-sorrel fluctuates in the draught of the 
 light summer wind, — the bright hues of the anemone 
 pulsitilla have long passed away; the delicate violet hath 
 ceased to load the breeze with perfume, and the blossom 
 of the white asphodel, and the lilac garniture of the 
 clustering cyclamen, fail to variegate the opening glades, 
 and snatches of smooth lawn, that momentarily basking 
 in the yellow sunshine, diversify the vast expanse of 
 forest scenery. 
 
 Through these immemorial depths of woodland, inter- 
 sected by paths worn by the Kanactz* and his droves, 
 the bright Morash flowed, tracing the windings of the 
 labyrinthian dell, and channelling its path through many 
 a green ravine. The river was irregular in its width ; 
 sometimes spreading over acres of the sylvan plain, but 
 more generally sweeping on with a soft and gurgling 
 sound, beneath the embowering groves, yet even so, oc- 
 casionally catching the warm crimson of heaven. Now, 
 lightly curled, by Zephyrus, into tiny wavelets, it would 
 bubble over the moss, or dance, in sparkling joyousness, 
 on the polished stones, and anon, creeping in deep tran- 
 quillity, where once its waters raved along, like a moun- 
 tain torrent, it reflected, in its translucent bosom, the 
 knolls and crags, by which it was closely margined, or 
 the woven grove, that at once shadowed its narrow cur- 
 rent with a deeper hue, and canopied its quietness. 
 These unexplored wilds echoed no more to the carols of 
 the feathered tribes, that, some months before, sported 
 amid their foliage, nor were their solitude and silence 
 interrupted, or their coverts penetrated, save at rare in- 
 tervals, by the music of the huntsman's bugle.

 the savage beasts of the forest multiplied, in the free and 
 almost undisturbed possession of their sylvan domain, 
 which was evidenced, by their being occasionally seen 
 prowling, beyond the verge of their solitary fastnesses. 
 The irascible boars, peculiar to the country, made fre- 
 quent irruptions into the more populous districts, and the 
 gaunt wolf and ferocious bear were not seldom a terror 
 to the adventurous shepherd, when, inadvertently, in 
 search of some straggler of his gigantic-horned flock, he 
 stumbled on those dark coverts, or tangled thickets, 
 where they made their lair. 
 
 As the course of the stream, along whose shagged 
 banks our traveller pursued his journey, winded nearer 
 the small clustered tenements, he had descried in the dis- 
 tance, the broken Volgy expanded, and the river emerged 
 upon a waster and wilder district, through which, (its 
 waters having been augmented by those of the Arangos* 
 from the Kalota mountains,) it rolled with a larger vo- 
 lume. He was not long in reaching the vicinity of the 
 little hamlet, which, shrouded in a mantle of acacia, his 
 experienced eye had recognised, from the first, for a set- 
 tlement of the Cyganis. The hoarse and sullen roar of 
 the brook loaded the atmosphere of noon, and, gradually 
 swelling on the traveller's ears, for the last quarter of a 
 mile, led him, in part, to anticipate the characteristic 
 scene, which a sharp turn of the road, in conformity with 
 the indentation of the river, suddenly presented to his 
 view. He found himself separated, by a narrow slip of 
 smooth sand, from a beautiful and artificial cascade. 
 Here the hand of art was assisted, in some measure, by 
 the natural obstacle of a range of basaltic rock, over 
 which dam-head the sylvan stream now made a decided 
 and rapid shoot, into the white and billowy pool beneath.

 The fall was not great, but, so far as it went, it formed 
 a charming foreground to the picture, our traveller 
 paused to contemplate, — and there were not awanting 
 accessaries, of a peculiar kind, to interest the beholder. 
 Over above, where the river dashed from its higher level 
 against the dyke, a multitude of strange, dark, squalid, 
 human beings, were observed busily engaged, sifting the 
 bed for that ore, to compose which, at the period we 
 treat of, the alchymist, in his visioned cave, raked the 
 cinders of his crucible in vain. The sex, styled soft, 
 par excellence, with their infants hanging from their 
 shoulders, and whose showy tatters scarcely sufficed for 
 decency, were dabbling up to their very knees, in the 
 turbid and flashing waters of the temporary dam, in 
 whose dark, and beating waves, their hearts found a 
 treacherous likeness. Men, as imperfectly clothed, placed 
 on projecting ledges of rock, were washing, in their 
 troughs, the particles of glittering sand, which adhered 
 to the XpvffOfxaXXos,* the golden fleece of undressed 
 sheepskins ; while scores of dark-eyed urchins, of both 
 sexes, and all ages, between inarticulate childhood and 
 vigorous youth, were disporting, mostly in a state of nu- 
 dity, at the bottom of the fall. These rose and sank in 
 the tortured billows, which chafed over the reef below, 
 like glancing spectres, save where, here and there, the 
 elder were contributing their small aid or impediment, as 
 the case miglit be. 
 
 The principal figure among the picturesque group, 
 hidden from view, by some intervening branches, till 
 the horseman came within a stone's throw of where she 
 stood, seemed placed there by the directing wish of 
 Salvator Rosa. The moment his eye lit on that form, 
 the rider reined in his steed instinctively, and, with such 
 a sudden recoil, as almost to throw him on his haunches. 
 Then he felt involuntarily for his arms, and would have

 again spurred the jaded destrier forwards. Mastering- 
 these impulses, however, he remained where he had 
 drawn in rein, silent, and, to all appearance, un- 
 moved, but internally agitated, while he awaited, with 
 awful misdoubtings, the first word of the hated appari- 
 tion. 
 
 The ancient beldame, in question, w^as clad with more 
 consideration than the other Cyganis, and her gay attire 
 was worn with an air of superiority, though fashioned in 
 that grotesque taste, ordinary to the vagrant tribe. She 
 presented a fantastic appearance, that might have 
 reminded the reader of Skelton's description of Ely- 
 noure Rumminge. She was stationed on a ledge of flat 
 rock, at the height of a few yards from the ground, 
 and within as many feet of the water's edge. To her 
 right was a clump of alders, and her emaciated hand 
 rested on the ragged trunk of an ancient pine, that, 
 rock-rooted, stretched, like a slippery bridge, right 
 athwart the breakwater, while parasite creepers, drenched 
 in sparry foam, either matted, in vigorous maturity, round 
 the fissured base, or (as if to listen to the music of the 
 fall, and swinging in mid-air over their no longer limpid 
 mirror,) clung to the whole length of tlie projecting pine, 
 by aerial tendrils. She reared her towering form, on an 
 ivied stone, while her scarlet Kcrialo* soiled by time, and 
 dank with the foamy spray, flapped to and fro, obedient 
 to the sweeping breeze. This woman, bending down 
 her haggard face and elfin locks, hailed our traveller 
 almost at the instant he pulled up, with a voice, whose 
 wild accent rivalled the rush of the broken current. 
 
 '' So ho ! well met !" she exclaimed, '* f have tarried 
 long and patiently, but not in vain, I see. I knew you 
 would take this road." As she spoke, she kept her eyes 
 fixed on the horseman's face, over which a cloud passed, 
 sio:nificant of inward vexation ; but whatever was the

 source of his trouble, it did not prevent his replying, 
 in a firm voice — 
 
 ** Would you aught with me, good Unna, that you 
 seem to lie in wait for my coming ? I dreamt not of 
 the pleasure of seeing you to-day." 
 
 The gipsy cut short these expressions of courtesy, by 
 throwing back her mantle, and stretching forth her long 
 bare arms to the skies. *' Doubtless, doubtless," she 
 rejoined, in a stern voice; — " the stars above vouch- 
 safe no warning, but bide their own fiat, in this and all 
 things else. Did I not tell you, from the beginning, 
 that, ere the prey of the mighty one was retaken, and the 
 spoil seized by the terrible, should be rescued, I would 
 confer with you ; and that, whether I accosted you on 
 Pusztas solitudes, or drew your midnight curtain in the 
 strongest var in Hungary, depended upon my pleasure, 
 not thine. But now, your good steed is jaded, and you 
 yourself must be worn with travel ; you require rest and 
 aliment ere you proceed. Should you still," she added, 
 with a peculiar expression, *' after what I have to com- 
 municate, persist in venturing to the city of the Zibin.* 
 Dismount, then, and resign the care of your horse to those 
 Chevos,f one of whom will guide you, in safety, whither 
 I, who will not be far behind, shall direct him." 
 
 Thus speaking, Unna turned away ; and, having beck- 
 oned two of the dripping youngsters, who, with gaping 
 mouths and staring eyes, had left their gambols, to as- 
 certain what was going on, addressed a few words to 
 them in the Cygani patois. Obediently, one laid hold 
 of the horse's bridle, while the other, tripping lightly 
 away, made signs to our traveller to follow him. For a 
 moment, the latter remained irresolute. He indented 
 his teeth in his nether lip, in evident vexation, and then, 
 whether it was that he descried something, in the gipsy's 
 proceedings, that argued a suspension of his own freedom

 of volition, he alighted ; and, silently, took the path, the 
 tawny gipsy youth had, previously, indicated, and which, 
 a few rods in advance, deflected a little from the public 
 causeway. 
 
 The dwellings of this tribe of the Cyganis, were on an 
 elevation, whose abruptness added to its height. A 
 slight waterfall was observed, trickling slowly down the 
 channels of the rock, maintaining the health and verdure 
 of those trees, of spontaneous growth, whose picturesque 
 disposition, beautified the mountain. Amongst these, 
 the graceful acacia, as usual, was most generally cul- 
 tivated. By means of notches, and slight projections in 
 the rock, and sometimes, by zigzag and irregular stairs, 
 conducting from hovel to hovel, our traveller clambered 
 up the graduating roofs, till he ascended to the level of 
 a detached habitation, of a somewhat superior appear- 
 ance, to those by which it was surrounded. The acacia 
 shot up, behind this dwelling, which it over-canopied 
 with branches, that, spreading far and wide, shook their 
 sere leaves upon the thatched piatza; beneath, and 
 about which, tame storks were seen, expatiating, with 
 their long bills, amid the accumulated filth and abomi- 
 nations, of more than one twelvemonth. Chained to the 
 little, low-arched door, the large-limbed, Hungarian 
 wolf-dog, the ordinary guardian of the abodes of the 
 Cyganis, ** bayed deep-mouthed welcome." 
 
 Into the interior of the semi-circular premises, our tra- 
 veller was ushered, by his agile Mercury, who, immedi- 
 ately, like a shot, took to his heels, leaving his charge 
 almost lost, in their dark, close, smothering atmosphere. 
 The walls, composed of loose stones and turf, had, not 
 long before, been whitewashed ; yet they already bore 
 evidence, that the legal vent, in the centre of the roof, 
 answered its destined object very unsatisfactorily, al- 
 though the circular aperture had been pierced, directly 
 over the fire-place, wiiich, constructed of clay, was 
 placed, according to custom, in the middle of the apart-

 ment. Furniture, there was literally none. A fragment" 
 of rock, which, it was clear, from the narrowness of the 
 door-way, and of the single loop-hole that admitted air 
 and light, must have been entombed at the first erection of 
 the hovel, served the purpose of a table. Near the dying 
 embers of the fire, was an earthen pot ; and, in a further 
 corner, a miscellaneous heap of utensils lay confusedly 
 together, on the cold, earthen floor. These consisted of 
 an iron pan, some spoons, a water jug, an odd knife, a 
 bellows, a stone anvil, and sundry carpenter's tools. A 
 large square of red cloth, tapestried one entire side of the 
 apartment. 
 
 The individual, who now found himself in the tempo- 
 rary tenancy of this hovel, having cast a cursory glance 
 around, at the vessels and implements we have inven- 
 toried above, seated himself on a broken chest, and 
 seemed patiently to await the coming of the gipsy. Mean- 
 time, his thoughts were not idle, but, travelling far, 
 comprehended, in their wide range, — the past, as in a 
 clear and single point, and the future,,. the vague and 
 undefined future, with its ever-shifting horizon of airy 
 schemes, and bright uncertainties. As we happen to 
 possess the means of developing these plxantasmas of 
 the brain, the curious reader would take it amiss, were 
 we to let the interval of breathing-time elapse, with- 
 out his having had some inkling afforded him, of 
 what was passing in the mind of the solitary stranger. 
 His meditations ran nearly in the following order : — 
 
 '* It were enough to persuade one, that this Boszor- 
 kany has the cunning these hucksters of fortune arrogate, 
 and for which she, in particular, bears such repute. For 
 eighteen long years, whenever we have met by chance, 
 not a hint has she let drop, of her agency in that trans- 
 action. I might have fancied, at times, only that I 
 knew the memory of the deed was ineffaceable, that she 
 had forgotten it all, so deep a silence has she maintained. 
 And yet, at last, when the hour has come for throwing

 off the mask, the cursed witch starts up suddenly, before 
 my eyes, reminding me of the very words, she so solemnly 
 uttered, when she consigned the new-born infant to my 
 custody. How comes she now to forecast my purpose ? 
 'Tis a perilous obstacle this, to our movements, but one 
 on whose occurrence, blinded by her cunning, I had not 
 sufficiently laid my account. Her evidence would, no 
 doubt, complete the link in the irrefragable chain, but 
 it were vain to hope for it. From whatever inscrutable 
 cause, he must be sure of her, or he had hardly dared to 
 set a price on the head of the brigand, her son. He 
 thought himself, also, sure of me ; — of me, whose life he 
 saved, indeed, to make it one long agony; — of me, 
 whose sister — poor Alicia, beloved saint! thy broken 
 heart is about to be avenged. We were the only mortal 
 witnesses, he deemed, he had cause to apprehend. He 
 dreamt not of Peter Pereny ; — where, where, now hides 
 the graf ? His single presence — his testimony, were of 
 more avail, than that signature of his, which the coronet 
 of St. Stephen will conceal through unnumbered years ; 
 unless the revealing death-bed inscription of John of 
 Zapola, be swiftly brought to light, — and that crown — 
 the Cygani has it — so I heard from Sigismund. But 
 she — the vagrant's here ! " 
 
 Such was the course of tumultuous thoughts, chafing 
 in the stranger's mind, for the few minutes preceding the 
 coming of Unna, whose form now appeared in the door- 
 way ; and her harsh voice was heard, before her figure 
 was obvious to his eye. 
 
 "Hark!" she exclaimed, ''hark, to that flourish! 
 those martial strains might rouse a warrior ; — but 
 thou ! " 
 
 The traveller listened, and his ears caught, faintly, the 
 music of the Hungarian march, mingling, by fits, with 
 the sullen roar of the waterfall beneath, whose deep 
 voice murmured through the apartment. With a marked 
 change of countenance, he started to his feet !

 '^ Dost hear ! " proceeded the gipsy, with a ghastly 
 laugh : "The capitany* comes, whose banner has never 
 yet quailed to an enemy." 
 
 " Whom mean you ?" demanded the other, snatching 
 hold of the helmet he had laid aside ; while such was his 
 paroxysm of consternation, that the instant paleness of 
 his visage rivalled the white feather, which surmounted 
 the glittering head-piece — at the same time, he made as 
 rapid a movement, as his trembling joints permitted, 
 towards the entrance of the hut. 
 
 " Our regent," returned the gipsy, as she slammed to 
 the postern, with violence, and assuming an erect and de- 
 termined posture, placed her back against it. " Marti- 
 nuzzi has taken the field, sir, and I now plainly tell you, 
 Luke Swartz, you quit not this spot till you learn my 
 will, and are prepared to obey it." 
 
 The individual, whose personal freedom was so unex- 
 pectedly placed " under circumscription and restraint," 
 and whom the reader's sagacity will most probably have 
 already recognised, for their sometime acquaintance, 
 looked aghast. 
 
 " The regent approaches, at the head of the Hungarian 
 army," continued Unna, " and within this hour, I expect 
 the honour of his company, even where you now stand 
 trembling." 
 
 *' Heavens !" exclaimed Swartz, with a discomposed 
 aspect and faltering voice, *' not for worlds would I meet 
 him. Good Unna, it is not long since I proved the means 
 of safety to Count Ragotzy, your son : we are in league, 
 as you know. I have hazarded my life with Martinuzzi, 
 by transporting Sigismund beyond his jurisdiction, but I 
 intrusted the youth with your son, as a pledge of my 
 fidelity." 
 
 Here Unna, casting on him a scornful glance, inter- 
 posed. " And having made himself wings, he and your 
 faith have taken flight together," said the gipsy.

 " For the freak of a madman, you hardly will consi- 
 der me accountable," returned Swartz, with some slight 
 appearance of embarrassment. 
 
 " A madman," repeated Unna, with scornful emphasis — 
 " His haviour was sane enough the other night, in the 
 vaults of Hermanstadt. 'Twas I, who proved the madder 
 I fear,, .who was most mad to show him the image of his 
 father, in the ebullition of my wrath against the regent, 
 for purposing to infringe the safe-conduct of my son. 
 From that hour, I have seen through your course of 
 fraud, but, mad or not mad, holding him in my hands, 
 I was in no hurry to do, what were better done quickly, 
 and what, but for thy treachery in heeding the puling 
 humanity of Martinuzzi, had been over eighteen years 
 ago, — now, however, that he has absconded, you are 
 amenable, and but one amend is in your power. Luke 
 Swartz, the body of Sigismund, dead or alive, must be 
 rendered to me." 
 
 '^ Only let me depart for the present," replied Swartz, 
 evasively, " and we will speak of it elsewhere, and when 
 you will." 
 
 Unna knit her brow. '' Now, or in this world never," 
 she cried, " must this difference be determined ! Attempt 
 not flight, for, know, I have planted armed men without, 
 to cut you down, should you venture." Then advancing 
 forward into the chamber, she added, " You will hardly 
 escape, but I leave you free to try the experiment. By 
 remaining, you need not fear encountering Martinuzzi ; 
 he will not be here yet awhile, and I shall have timely 
 notice of his approach. Rest thee then in peace, and 
 partake of such behoveful refreshment, as methinks will 
 be no bad induction to that mutual understanding, which 
 presently, without more ado, we must re-establish." 
 
 Swartz was not lacking in '' the better part of valour." 
 He acknowledged to himself, the policy of following the 
 above recommendation, and immediately resumed his seat 
 on the chest, while Unna proceeded to discharge her

 culinary functions, — the earthen pipkin was placed in 
 the midst of the wood embers, which at lenojth leaped 
 into a flame, — the smoke whereof, eddied about in many 
 a graceful wreathe. First, there was set before our tra- 
 veller a basin of boiled prunes; then pieces of salmon 
 and char were broiled on the glowing charcoal, and, 
 after being thrown into a scarlet fever, by a plentiful 
 sprinkling of the paprika, or cayenne of Hungary, were 
 served up. 
 
 The fish, Unna assured him, as he silently applied him- 
 self to its destruction, had been caught in the neighbour- 
 ing stream, which, although perhaps not quite so populous 
 as the celebrated Theisse,* abounded, like most of the 
 Hungarian rivers, in the finny race. 
 
 During the short and frugal repast, the remarks and 
 responses on either side were few and brief. Swartz 
 watched the motions of his hostess with a critical eye, and 
 his apprehension, sharpened by imminent peril, discovered 
 a stern, unbending resolution in her demeanour, which, to 
 say sooth, generated certain misgivings in his mind, 
 which made it hard for him to recover his customary 
 artifice, and self-command, — but not before he was rea- 
 sonably well refreshed, and his meal washed down by a 
 few cruises of tolerable mead, did the Cygani interrupt 
 his cogitation, in good earnest, by abruptly demanding — 
 
 " Whither the wild fugitive had betaken himself, after 
 having effected his escape from the subterranean fortress, 
 where Ragotzy left him ?" 
 
 " He remains in the neighbourhood of Coloswar, at 
 present," answered Swartz. 
 
 '^ Ha!" cried Unna, " Now, mind ye me both, and 
 thou Swartz, take heed of following a shade. Coloswar 
 hath lost the apple of her eye, — her glory hath departed 
 out of her, — she plumeth herself on her stout defence, 
 
 * The Theisse ; said to be more prolific in fish, than any other river 
 in Europe, in so much, that according to a popular hyperbole, the river 
 is two parts water, and one fish.

 andlaugheth to scorn, the attacks of BaptistaCastaldo ; 
 but her mirth is, like the ground we tread upon, hollow, 
 Luke Swartz. Yet, it is even for that ye affect her, and 
 you deem not that the casket hath been rifled, and des- 
 poiled of its treasure. I know you, man, and what's more, 
 I penetrated through your shallow compliance, from the 
 first. I would now pluck out these two eyes, could they 
 have deceived me, what time I gave the babe into your arms. 
 Double-dyed villain ! I saw thy drift, and perceived you 
 were false; but I pretended to be thy dupe ; for even then, 
 I pierced the dim horizon, that curtained the expanse of 
 time, and the reflection of the present hour of vengeance 
 was shadowed on my mental vision ; but had I all along 
 been blind as credulity, it were now to be undeceived. 
 Coloswar ! — why, thou fool! — I can look through and 
 through thee. What but the shadowy lure of a crown 
 makes the idiot haunt Coloswar ? Luke Swartz, when in 
 the vaults of Hermanstadt, in the rage of inspiration and 
 revenge, I vaguely gave the boy to know his parentage ; 
 he remarked significantly, ' Fools are no rubs in the way 
 of usurpers.' Thou hast done more, sir; thouhasttold him 
 all, and now would take advantage of the lord regent's 
 absence, to pave the way in Hermanstadt, for his recep- 
 tion. You have shuffled and dealt cunningly ; yet, though 
 a skilful gamester, have failed in a single card. Your 
 chances were nicely calculated, sir, — only one antagonist 
 you disregarded,— the gipsy, Unna. One little impedi- 
 ment you overlooked, — the force of nature!" 
 
 Swartz, who, throughout the above address, had sunk 
 his head upon his breast, in a dejected posture, now looked 
 up. "I do not understand you, sage and gentle 
 Unna," he said, in a tone, where his chagrin and un- 
 easiness vainly endeavoured to disguise themselves, under 
 an affectation of indifference, — "the force of nature! 
 What natural claim can Martinuzzi prefer to your al- 
 legiance or fidelity ?" 
 
 " And if he have none, which may or may not be,"

 rejoined Unna, haughtily, *' of this be assured, thou 
 shalt not profit by my defection, neither thou nor the 
 wretched namesake of Count Rodna. Who is there breath- 
 ing, who would serve, whom they have contributed 
 to injure, and must necessarily hate?" * 
 
 " Nay," replied Swartz, persuasively, rising from his 
 seat, and pacing the narrow cell as he spoke, " who, 
 rather, would care to save, who has so injured them? 
 Is not a price set upon the head of Count Ragotzy?" 
 
 " And if so," rejoined Unna, sullenly, and in a low 
 quick tone, " there may have been good cause and ex- 
 cuse for that, for what you can tell, sir equerry ; but, 
 whether or no," she continued, more earnestly, and with 
 some manifestation of feeling, " there will be ample ven- 
 geance exacted, without my aid, without thy interfer- 
 ence. When the prey of the mighty one be retaken, it is 
 notlhou, Luke Swartz," she continued, fixing hereyesupon 
 him she addressed, '^ shalt exalt thee by the rescue." 
 
 *' Not more than thou and thy people will benefit, 
 good Unna," returned the other, in his most urbane 
 tones: '^whatever stipulations you may please to make 
 for their good, and their liberties, I am sure, the princely 
 Sigismund will gladly ratify. The grant to the descend- 
 ants of Thomas Polgar, will be respected under his rule, 
 no less than by his predecessors." 
 
 A forced smile distorted the lip of the keeper, while 
 Unna, in return, smiled her derisive sense of his words, 
 but did not speak. Swartz paused, but presently re- 
 sumed, as if on fuller consideration. ** The edict of 
 exile,t against the Cygani race, shall not even have

 freedom shall be guaranteed ; also, like him, you shall 
 have ground allotted, and dwellings built for you, and, 
 where injured, your nation shall equally be entitled to re- 
 dress with the Magyari." 
 
 Unna laughed outright. " A Cygani wants no such 
 redress," she vauntingly exclaimed, and her whole figure 
 seemed to swell out with new-born energy. " Revenge is 
 his redress ; his right arm the only minister he acknow- 
 ledges, and if he fall, he has a whole nation for avengers. 
 Much good to Germany did that uncompromising re- 
 script of the sapient emperor, since when, nor life, nor 
 property has been safe, throughout the vast extent of the 
 empire. The exterminating hand hath passed over all 
 the country, and its produce, man and beast. The hoarse 
 discordant voice of the raven alone, gives note of ani- 
 mated being, where erst the peasant's merry pipe re- 
 sounded. Is it not meet, think you, we write our free- 
 dom in the blood of our oppressors ? The Cygani sports 
 not the gem of moist-eyed pity, nor wears the lowly mien 
 of timid mercy. Born amid wilds, and nursed on sunny 
 heaths, we bear the brown blush on our wanton cheeks. 
 'Tis our boast to be the playmates of the winds, and the 
 denizens of the elements. Inured to bold adventure, we 
 herd in the forest, and track the wolf and wild boar to 
 
 be gathered from an epistle of Michael Brutus, ad Crotonem, lib. 3, 
 p. 332. ann. 1577. The reader may be inclined to infer from the fol- 
 lowing passage, that their irruption into Transylvania occurred at a still 
 earlier era than that which we have assigned : " La plus commune 
 opinion et la plus vraisemble est que du terns de Charlemagne la 
 nation Saxonne, qui resista si long terns a la puissance de cet Empe- 
 reur, fut obligee de quitter rAllemagne pour eviter d'etre entierement 
 extermince. Une grande partie se letira en Hongrie, et de la en Tran- 
 sylvanie." — INlem. du Comte Betlem Nicklos. 
 
 Bonfinius, Dec. 1. lib. ix., would seem to be the authority for the fore- 
 going, in which he was followed by Thuanus Ilistor, lib. xi. p. 244. 
 \Ve believe both to have been in error ; but our reasons for holding that 
 opinion cannot be compressed within the limits of a note. Let the first 
 coming of the Saxons have been when it may, their posterity constitute, at 
 the present day, a considerable portion of the population of Transylvania.

 their familiar den ; nor will we ever abandon our liberal ' 
 lives for domes, where man to man is bound in servitude. 
 We disdain the thrall, — we are at eternal war with your 
 chartered tyrannies, and, that our untamed spirits may 
 be free for evermore, we shun your vassalage, keep 
 aloof from your walled vars and cities — spit upon your 
 laws, and for redress, — we need it not." 
 
 " But, by Sigismund, your grant shall truly be held 
 inviolate," observed Swartz. 
 
 *' Oh ! — ay," rejoined Unna, with a half-suppressed 
 sneer ; " that, you mean, of the Bishop of Funfkirchen to 
 my husband. Well, from the king Mathias, down to 
 our present regent, with one single exception, — with one 
 single exception, (mark me !) agent of Sigismund, that of 
 John of Zapola, it has been observed and countersigned, 
 and shall, if ever George Martinuzzi cease to rule, still 
 be held inviolate ; but not by that boy ! — Luke Swartz, 
 — not by that boy." 
 
 The baffled diplomatist stood for a long time motion- 
 less, with his head bent down. " By whom, then, good 
 Unna ?" he at length inquired. Is the child, Czerina, 
 likely to uphold your peoples' privileges, so zealously, as 
 would a kiral, who will feel himself indebted to your 
 testimony, for the possession of liis rightful inheritance?" 
 
 " Her weakness were our security," returned Unna ; 
 " but she, alas ! is out of the question. The cardinal 
 purposes, after raising the seige of Coloswar, formally to 
 deprive her of all these territories." 
 
 " Whom, then, would he make sovereign ?" demanded 
 Swartz, exhibiting symptoms of surprise. 
 
 " Himself," answered Unna ; ^' but since that Vicchy 
 is led to fancy his heretic daughter heir of Hungary, the 
 secret, you wot of, may get wind, and his eminence's proud 
 
 character, may receive such a shock, that, though 
 
 that remains to be proved. Enough, Luke Swartz ; nei- 
 ther you, nor any living, need hope to antedate a doom, 
 which lies knit up, and woven in the skein of events. I

 pierce your politics, sir ! you are now commissioned to 
 Queen Isabella, and, I doubt not, design still further to 
 commit Eissenburg to your cause, under illusory visions 
 of grandeur. I have only one word to object to this : 
 you go not to Hermanstadt at all. Eissenburg is no 
 longer a prisoner, but attends the regent to Coloswar ; 
 and, for the queen! — mark my prediction, Swartz. 
 Whosoever would reveal to the widow of King John, the 
 deception practised on her, before he opes his lips, will 
 receive the penalty of his officious daring ; whether you 
 credit me or not, my words are binding, as the iron 
 shackles of destiny, and, herein, will be verified in blood. 
 You are a wise man, I know," she shortly added, in a 
 tone of bitter contempt; "and will not be sorry to 
 escape the risk, — however, if you hesitate, the means are 
 at hand to enforce obedience. Now, for your answer?" 
 Even while Unna was speaking, Swartz had revolved 
 the matter over, and, ere she had concluded, he had de- 
 cided on the course of action, it behoved him to pursue. 
 The exquisite wariness and deep vindictiveness of this 
 man's character, were qualities, perhaps, incompatible 
 with the possession of any extraordinary intrepidity. In- 
 deed it was almost essential to such a temperament that 
 he wanted that degree of courage, which his persisting in 
 his original intention would have inferred. Not that Swartz 
 entertained the least faith in Unna's prophetic endow- 
 ments ; but he had reason to think, that she had the 
 means of bringing about the fulfilment of her sinister pre- 
 diction, by physical agencies, and he feared, that in ease 
 of opposition, she would have small scruple to employ 
 them. Besides, being, to all intents, in her power, he saw 
 he must submit to the will of his arbitress, if he would not 
 put his life in instant jeopardy. He, therefore, inti- 
 mated his acquiescence in her wishes, and requested 
 leave immediately to retrace his steps, to wliere his hap- 
 less charge was deposited. Unna turned from the speaker 
 without a word. She stood wrapt, and composed her

 wrinkled brow, as if to deep thought. ''To think," she- 
 muttered in an indrawn voice, " that Alaric, having had 
 that youth once captive, should have suffered him to 
 break bounds, maddens me ! Had he known who was 
 committed to his tender mercies !" Then, abruptly facing 
 her companion, she said, " Whether you obtain your 
 liberty depends on yourself; you must again resign the 
 person of Sigismund into the custody of Count Ragotzy." 
 
 From whatever cause, Swartz kept silence. " Point 
 out the exact spot where, at this moment, the youth 
 lurks, and you are free," rejoined the gipsy. 
 
 Swartz still hesitated, fearful of hazarding a reply. 
 
 " Seek not to equivocate; but speak," said Unna. 
 
 " I cannot, if I would," at length, returned the keeper. 
 " He is beyond my reach, having joined the predatory 
 bands of the Wallachian." 
 
 "Of whom?" asked Unna. 
 
 '' Of the Vilez, Richter Iwan," answered Swartz. 
 
 A livid and hideous smile deformed the ever rigid 
 features of the old hag, and the hues of her yellow and 
 withered countenance brightened. The nature of the re- 
 sponse she would have rendered, however, cannot be 
 affirmed, for, at that moment, the door opened, and a 
 gipsy entering the hovel, in great seeming haste, commu- 
 nicated with Unna in their peculiar dialect. " Guide 
 him hitherward," said the ancient crone, and the ragged 
 messenger disappeared. 
 
 " Martinuzzi approaches," she cried, turning to Swartz;

 The blood of Swartz ran cold in his veins, and his thin

 he deprecated the having to come in contact with the

 regent. Unna glanced at him from head to foot, and 
 her wrinkled visage contorted into a smile, the expression 
 of which, superior to contempt, made his very blood to 
 creep. After luxuriating in his manifest terrors for 
 awhile, she observed, " If you would avoid meeting Mar- 
 tinuzzi, you will have to submit to close confinement, 
 during the interval of his stay." 
 
 Eagerly, Swartz intimated his consent, when the gipsy 
 raised the arras, and, stooping, indicated with her finger, 
 a small door, ajar. " There, retire," said Unna, " and 
 abide my will, but deceive not thyself with vain hopes. 
 Should St thou even obtain the ear of Isabella, it were to 
 no purpose. Thou wouldst act wiser to dig thine own 
 grave, than seek to bring this tale to light ; for no stra- 
 tegic upon earth can avert the destiny of the tale-bearer." 
 Here the sound of footsteps, close at hand, hastened the 
 movements of the keeper. Obeying the direction of his 
 hostess's eyes, he passed rapidly through the narrow por- 
 tal, and found himself in substantial darkness.

 We have no room to detail the particulars of what passed., 
 subsequent to the exit of Swartz, in the cave-dwelling of 
 the ancient Boszorkany. Martinuzzi did not make long 
 tarriance there, and on his departure, as he lifted the 
 latch of the low, small outer door of the hut; '' I go," he 
 said, and the eye of the warrior brightened up; " I go, 
 to measure swords with Piadena. 
 
 " May victory wait upon your arms, as your cause is 
 just !" answered Unna. 
 
 " 'Tis that of my country," exclaimed Martinuzzi, with 
 solemn energy. 
 
 " And her queen!" added the gipsy. 
 
 " Hungaria!" said Martinuzzi, and quitted the hut. 
 
 Unna remained, in the same position, for several minutes, 
 after her visitor was gone. " Brave and incomparable 
 spirit!" she exclaimed, " in the fortress of thy fame, there 
 is but one point left unguarded, and through that, thou 
 art doomed to fall. It is a childish puling humanity of 
 thine, that would let a viper sting thee twice to the heart.

 chance, yet in time for the security of Count Ragotzy, 
 and his Cygani menyasgony.* I'll wait, however, till I 
 hear further of Richter Iwan's new recruit, — he was too 
 wandering to understand me that night; and Swartz may 
 not have whispered in his ear, the nobleness of his origin ; 
 or, say he have, where is his proof? To time and the 
 course of events, I refer for answer." In this resolution 
 of being guided by circumstances, we leave the gipsy

 It was sun-set, and the sailing clouds, like a rich 
 argosy, bore bravely their freight of gold and silver, and 
 the long shadows of Coloswar were projecting, in deeper 
 and blacker shade, wdien the last division of the Hunga- 
 rian patriots debouched, from under the leafy arches of 
 the forest, upon a more open country, within a few miles 
 of the beleaguered city. The regent's lines were being 
 marked out, in front of the deep and twilight woods, on 
 an elevated mound of earth, flanked by the lesser Samos, 
 along whose banks the different leaders pitched their 
 several tents, each surmounted by his proper banner; 
 whilst at a little greater distance to the right, the super- 
 numerary war-steeds were grazing at large. The woods 
 resounded with the din of preparation. Here were ar- 
 tificers *' accomplishing the knights," and fabricating 
 warlike- engines against the morrow. There were smiths 
 and carpenters, occupied with their glowing forges, and 
 deafening hammers. The appearance of so many gallant 
 animals at apparent liberty, — the graceful forms of the 
 men, as they were actively employed, in digging trenches, 
 fixing pallisadoes, or running up the canvass tenements, — 
 the scarcely waving branches of the dense wood, which 
 hedged in the war-like amphitheatre, formed an animated 
 foreground; while to the right, the eye caught partial 
 glimpses, through the beautiful autumnal barrier, of the

 Abbey of Coloswar. Farther still, at the opposite side of 
 the river, which was crossed by the sun's glancing light, 
 his last effulgence gleamed on the spears and helmets of 
 the advanced post-guard of the imperial host, lighting up 
 the dense forest scenery beyond (which gradually bulged 
 into gentler ascents, and larger swells of variegated wood- 
 land), and leaving finally a rim of burnished splendour 
 along the blue line of the Bagartolke mountains, which 
 (softened down, and suffused with a slight vapour, that 
 caught the setting ray) closed the view in the haze of 
 distance. 
 
 Martinuzzi was on horseback, surrounded by many of 
 his capitanies and chief officers. Among the rest, Va- 
 lentinian, Count Turascus, rode by his side. At the period 
 of our tale, this magnat held the rank of commander-in- 
 chief of the Hungarian army. He, moreover, exercised the 
 functions, properly belonging to the office of palatine; 
 which, since the death of Stephen Bathori, in 1535, had 
 fallen into abeyance : — to this dignity, it was the avowed 
 intention of Martinuzzi, to exalt him; but, owing to cir- 
 cumstances, the palatinate came not to be re-established, 
 until a few years after the date of our present story, 
 when it was revived, for a short period, in the person 
 of Thomas Nadastis.* Near Turascus, was the graf 
 Maylat, the son of that Stephanus Maylat, whose turbu- 
 lence had troubled, not a little, the latter years of the 
 reign of King John. Not far off, rode the Baron Balassi, 
 the friend and compatriot of Maylat, and Thomas Na- 
 dastis, the uncle of the young graf. They had joined in 
 the insurrection of Turascus, and were among the last 
 bold men, who asserted the independence of their " order," 
 equally disputing the right of the late king, to will his 
 
 * Since the death of Nadastis, tlie duties of this high office have been

 authority, and that of Martinuzzi to assume it. Be- 
 sides these, there were gathered together a crowd of 
 nobles and knights, — all eminent for the greatness of 
 their fortunes and families ; or for their ecclesiastical 
 and civil dignities. Summoned by the voice of the 
 herald, and in obedience to the bloody glaive, that 
 Martinuzzi had transmitted through the land, they at- 
 tended the rendezvous, with the men-at-arms of their 
 captaincies. Here were Stephanus Dobus, afterwards 
 so famous for standing the siege of Agria; Mark Hor - 
 with, and Nicholas Zrinii, successively the governors of 
 Zigeth, in the defence of which, they came to immortalize 
 their names : Balthasar Zrinii, the son of the former ; 
 together with the powerful Barons Barcotius, George 
 Tury, Mark Lilinensius, Melchior Balus, Scapha Vaida, 
 John Banify, and a long list of others, equally gentle, 
 and of hardly less note. These were the principal mag- 
 nats of Hungary, and were every one conspicuous for 
 their own merits, or prided themselves on some desert 
 of ancestry, handed down by the diploma of centuries. 
 In addition to the forces at the command of these va- 
 rious chieftains, many of the principal cities of Transyl- 
 vania had responded to his orders, and sent forth their 
 fighting men to the field. Troops of horse, and bodies 
 of foot soldiers, were observed for many preceding days, 
 debouching through the forests, to join their countrymen. 
 Martinuzzi, however, was well aware, that a large pro- 
 portion of his captains were lukewarm partizans at the 
 best. Most of the exiled noblemen, whose allodial pos- 
 sessions lay beyond the Theisse, followed him in consi- 
 deration of his reputation in the art of war, seeing no 
 other feasible means of speedily recovering their forfeited 
 estates ; whilst the Transylvanian lords, Barcotius, Na- 
 dastis, and others, had long felt the independence of their 
 authority sadly curtailed, and their dignity sullied in the 
 eyes of their feudatories, by the supremacy of the court 
 of Hermanstadt. They were, therefore, desirous of

 transferring the seat of the government to Buda, and so 
 relieving their immediate territory of so strict and impar- 
 tial a supervisor, as the regent: neither of these parties 
 took the field, from the unmixed motive of love of coun- 
 try, or were otherwise much inclined to uphold the ar- 
 bitrary sway of their ruler, longer than it subserved their 
 own views; but there remained a third faction, whose 
 politics went much further. Several of the leaders, fired 
 with indignation, at the impending usurpation of Marti- 
 nuzzi, and pitying the forlorn state of their youthful 
 sovereign, were using their best endeavours to come to 
 terms with the invader, deeming the interests of the daugh- 
 ter of King John, safer in the hands of the house of Haps- 
 burg, although an enemy, than under the sinister aus- 
 pices of her ambitious guardian. Some few of these 
 latter, were in the secret of Isabella's wishes, to whose 
 ears the death, or captivity, of the regent, were more wel- 
 come tidings, than would be a battle fought and won. 
 Martinuzzi, though he might not be exactly cognizant of 
 the extent of the defection, knew wherein lay the weak- 
 ness of his force; and, to countervail any treasonable 
 practices of the Hungarian magnats, had, for some time, 
 maintained in his pay (as we elsewhere explained), a 
 troop of mercenaries, in the capacity of body guard. 
 These, from their fidelity, steady discipline, and indo- 
 mitable courage, were reputed the elite of the regent's 
 force. They amounted to twelve thousand men-at-arms, 
 three-fourths of whom were infantry. 
 
 " They sold their blood for foreign pay, 
 The camp their home, their law the sword, 
 They knew no country."* 
 
 On the steady services of these mercenaries, Martinuzzi 
 principally relied, and they well merited his confidence. 
 The cardinal, as was his invariable rule, during his cam-

 paign, had cast aside his ecclesiastic habit, and his gold 
 embossed accoutrements had little to distinguish him 
 from the high-born magnats, who followed him to the 
 field. 
 
 " Turascus," said Martinuzzi, in a low tone, which 
 reached no other ears than those, for which it was in- 
 tended; " I would not interrupt this business of pitching 
 our tents, though truly, if all turn out, as I anticipate, 
 it will be labour to little purpose." 
 
 " Wherefore, your eminence," replied Turascus in the 
 same key, " not inform the capitanies, you intend sur- 
 prising the enemy during the night." 
 
 '' Even that he may indeed be taken by surprise," said 
 Martinuzzi ; ** see you not, that, of these self-styled pa- 
 triots, one half is false, and t'other half fickle ? If we 
 would not find Piadena drawn out in battle array, we 
 must keep close counsel, my friend, till the moment for 
 action. Our setting about these works, as if for a settled 
 encampment, will blind all parties ; and once get them 
 engaged, without having previously held correspondence 
 with yon outposts, and I'll ensure my heroes playing an 
 honourable part, through sheer necessity. Within an 
 hour, Quendi Ferens must have crossed, and he has 
 engaged to hold the enemy employed, until our main 
 army take. its position, on the opposite banks of the Sa- 
 mos. I shall not stir, however, till I receive the despatch 
 I look for; then, only let Raoul time well his sally from 
 Coloswar, and, by the Holy Trinity ! ere sunrise, we shall 
 have a good account to render to Ferdinand, of his auda- 
 cious ambassador." 
 
 '^ Every thing promises fairly," observed Turascus. 
 
 ** Truly, my lord," said Martinuzzi, " unless the blow 
 we aim be decisive, it were better never stricken. I left 
 Mark Antoine Ferraro, the secretary of this Piadena, 
 half persuaded of my submission to his master's will. I 
 felt my defiance were best learned in the discomfiture of 
 the Austrian arms. The regality he proflTered, as the price

 of my winking at his invasion of Transylvania, please 
 God ! shall never be at a foreigner's disposal." 
 
 He paused, and Turascus was necessarily silent, for he 
 feared, at the moment, to trust his voice in answer. 
 
 *' If Providence," continued Martinuzzi, " will have 
 me weigh my head with the holy crown of St. Stephen, 
 I must wear it. Count Turascus, by virtue of the sword 
 that accompanies it. Hungary and Transylvania, while I 
 hold sway, shall be held in fief of no potentate in Europe." 
 Martinuzzi's eye brightened with his theme. 
 
 "Has your eminence any intention, then?" interro- 
 gated Turascus, after a short pause, in a stifled tone. 
 
 " Stranger things have happened in Hungary, my 
 lord," interrupted the cardinal. ''The Magyari will 
 scarcely be sorry, for they will remember our national 
 adage." 
 
 '' The crosier hath doubtless ever proved an easy 
 sceptre, but I know no example of its having been exerted 
 as such, save by right of office, and in conformity to the 
 laws," said Turascus, with a brow somewhat overclouded, 
 and with more distance of manner than before. 
 
 " 'Tis critical sport, trifling on the verge of fate," 
 rejoined Martinuzzi, changing a topic, which he began to 
 find embarrassing. '' Have the pontoons been thrown 
 across the stream, over against yon grove ?" 
 
 " By incessant labour, that necessary preliminary is all 
 but accomplished," replied Turascus. " The volunteer 
 knight, bearing neither crest or plume on helmet, nor 
 cognizance on shield, — our vizor'd compatriot in thisexpe- 
 dition, has the present ordering of the work. I will now, 
 however, with your leave, join him, and see to their com- 
 pletion;" and Turascus turned his horse's head, in the 
 direction of the grove. 
 
 " I hope to ford soon after midnight, my lord," said 
 Martinuzzi, as he reined his own courser aside. " We 
 shall have the advantage of the moon ; and Turascus — " 
 Martinuzzi paused, till he again got his horse neck and

 neck, with that of the general, when he subjoined, in a 
 slow and significant voice — ** I'd recommend your hold- 
 ing small speech with that nameless knight ; my reasons 
 you shall learn hereafter, when you will allow my cau- 
 tion was not given without cause. Now, time presses — 
 I will detain you no longer." 
 
 The countenance of Turascus exhibited some marks 
 of his surprise ; he made no reply, however, and after 
 an obeisance of unwonted gravity, returned with an infi- 
 nitely less degree of stiflhess, he gave his steed the rein, 
 and dashed a-head like an arrow. 
 
 The character of the defender of Buda, seems to have 
 been that of an honourable man, and a lover of his coun- 
 try ; and although ever ready to espouse the interests of 
 Isabella, Martinuzzi did not, on that account, hesitate to 
 name him commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army. 
 So that the military ability of the general, he had van- 
 quished, proved one of the main pillars of the regent's 
 authority. 
 
 Turascus, deeming that any further manifestation in 
 favour of the co-ordinate sway of the queen regent, 
 would only eventually militate against the fortunes of 
 her daughter, had long tacitly submitted to Martinuzzi's 
 usurped authority. Like our own Blake, a century later, 
 he was content to do the state good service, though the 
 existing government was one, whose title he neither ac- 
 knowledged, nor approved of. In common with other 
 Hungarian magnats, he was governed by nearly similar 
 feelings to those, which Appian of Alexandria well de- 
 scribes to have favourably influenced the Roman people, 
 towards the tyranny of Sylla; they thought it called in 
 question their humanity {^CKavQpioTzia), to hate that power, 
 how tyrannical soever it were, that was joined with the 
 public good. *

 *' So, that, which I all along misdoubted, is now too 
 evident," communed Turascus with himself, as he bent 
 his course towards the Samos. " This raven has cance- 
 liered so long over the royal unicorn, * only to ensure 
 inevitably the destruction of his victim. But it will 
 hardly consist with my gratitude and honour, to stand by, 
 and witness the fell swoop. Yet what remains? Am I 
 called upon to jeopardy the independence of my country, 
 which only this prelate, of all men living, can and will 
 uphold, in the teeth of king and kaisar, for the sake of a 
 name ; and perhaps, after all, by my interference, only 
 precipitate his measures of violence ? Am I, in fate's 
 despite, to essay, how long the feeble grasp of feminate 
 authority can hold the truncheon of command, whose 
 weight, in a realm so fierce as ours, must depend entirely 
 on the firmness and dexterity of the hand, which sways 
 it ? 'Tis a nice point for a sorry casuist like me. At all 
 events, these insolent invaders must first receive their 
 merited chastisement, and then, perhaps — " 
 
 (paivirai. Appian's works abound in such. Whether it be to his credit 
 or otherwise, this deponent saith not ; we state a fact, but disclaim all

 courtier as some other writers under the empire ; for instance, Dion Cas- 
 sius. See the opening of that historian*s 44th book.

 The irregularity of the ground soon obscured the pala- 
 tine elect, from the view of the regent, as, turning his 
 steed in a different direction, he rode slowly alongside of 
 the Grafs Maylat and Balassi, and another capitany ; 
 who, regardless of his noble companions, was apparently 
 amusing himself, by curbing the mettle of the animal he 
 bestrode, so as to restrict his gamesome mood within the 
 narrowest limits. Some such caracole of the manage, 
 the writer confesses to have sometime played off, by dint 
 of spur and curb, that he might catch admiring maidens' 
 eyes, and frighten babes withal. In the present case, 
 however, the quadruped seemed to be putting forth his 
 paces for his proper pastime; the rider, indeed, restrain- 
 ed his managed steed, with that habitual skill and slight 
 handling of the reins, and imperceptible pressure of the 
 limbs, which betokened the experienced horseman ; but 
 the reasoning instinct of the brute came somehow to 
 divine, that the directing mind v/as amissing, so he 
 thought fit to evince his contempt for mere finger and 
 thumb, by persisting in his prancings and curvets, when, 
 according to all the rules of equitation, he should have 
 obeyed the rein. The spurred and belted knight in ques- 
 tion, was far advanced in years, and the few white hairs, 
 which parted below the helmet, over the forehead, crown- 
 ed with venerableness an aspect, which, even in other 
 respects,, was exceedingly prepossessing. This latter 
 epithet may seem inapplicable to the physiognomy of age, 
 but 'tis a phrase to our taste, since, barring our philan- 
 thropy, where lovely young women are in the case, all of 
 human sympathy remaining to us, is centred (albeit not 
 superannuated ourselves) on virtuous senility. 
 
 " Banfi'y," said the regent, coming close up to the 
 bridle-rein of the venerable magnat, " I have noted, 
 with uneasiness, thou hast kept aloof, since what time 
 we set out on this excursion. Such is not thy wont, my 
 friend ; wherein have I offended V

 much occupied in watching the play of the sun-beams,' 
 on the craggy summit of the Bagartolke hills. After a 
 minute's pause, the regent resumed. 
 
 " Why man, the gloom on thy brow will not be light- 
 ened, or refract yon brightness of the mountain top, by 
 turning thy face to the west. Instruct me, that I may 
 expiate my involuntary transgression." 
 
 Banfly looked graver than before, as, with a stiff, for- 
 mal inclination, whose humility mingled the feather of 
 his helmet, with his horse's mane, he replied : "It would 
 ill beseem one of my condition, to comment on your 
 eminence's conduct." 
 
 Maylat turned aside his head, to hide the irrepressible 
 sneer, that stole athwart his countenance. 
 
 " Nay now, you mock us," returned the cardinal, 
 " and 'tis clear there's more in this. My lord, does our 
 hurried movement dislike you ?" 
 
 A glow of fierce pride, overspread the countenance of 
 the ancient chief, but he made no reply, for near a mi- 
 nute ; " My lord cardinal," he at length exclaimed, 
 with uncontrollable energy : " 'Tis now five-and-twenty 
 years, since Spanish hirelings, and Austrian levies, laid 
 waste my rich possessions, pillaged my castles, and 
 driving away my flocks and herds, left John Banffy, 
 neither food, nor covering, and all for what, your emi- 
 nence ? For his inviolable attachment to his anointed 
 king. When the good dame prayed me, on her knees, 
 that 1 would heed the overtures of Ferdinand, I spurned 
 her where she knelt, and gave her to know, I had but one 
 wife, and one sovereign, and that my loyalty to John of 
 Zapola, was based on an oath, as sacred, as that of my 
 fidelity to my spouse.* With yourself, my reverend lord, 
 I waited on the royal exile, in the house of Jerome Las- 
 cus, and in requital, the archduke left me neither hold,

 nor hearth, — land, nor szustors, nor living thing, un- 
 rifled, unscathed, unslain, in all the broad country of my 
 fathers. The ashes of my kindred, and my king, loudly 
 call on me, never to desert my loyalty ; and, by the holy 
 rood ! the brief, and only hours of happiness, I have since 
 passed, are those, when, with harness on my back, and 
 my true sword in my hand, I raise my battle-cry, of 
 BanfFy and revenge !" 
 
 The Counts Maylat and Balassi, turned their looks 
 upon each other, and exchanged glances, of peculiar 
 meaning ; and the old chieftain, after a moment, added ; 
 " Judge, from what I have said, how far it is likely, your 
 sudden expedition troubles me." 
 
 There may have been something, in the above pouring 
 forth of the ancient capitany, that did not well attune 
 with the feelings of him, to whom it was addressed. 
 BanfFy 's delivery may have been over- vehement, and so 
 have jarred on the regent's ear; or worse, his allusions 
 may have jarred on the regent's conscience. We only 
 know, that Martinuzzi, after labouring to conceal a move- 
 ment of resentment, coldly remarked, in return : — 
 
 " I must, then, have been under a mistake, my lord," 
 and, without another word, he walked his horse a little 
 space forward. 
 
 *' Your lordship is monstrous bitter, this fine after- 
 noon, methinks," cried young Maylat, approaching 
 nearer the Count BanfFy. 
 
 " How so ?" gruffly inquired BanfFy. 
 
 *' Could you entertain his highness, with nought but 
 themes of loyalty, and fidelity, and such anti-Mohachian 
 subjects? Know you not, they are grown out of favour, 
 since King Lewis lost his life, and crown, by going his 
 own gait ? You are not in the mode." 
 
 " 'Twas too cutting, my lord, by my faitli ! to raise 
 the memory of your meeting in Poland," observed Ba- 
 lassi, who had just joined the speakers.

 '' And worse to allude, with such caustickness, to John 
 of Zapola," proceeded Maylat ; " whose very name is 
 wormwood, in the ear of his eminence." 
 
 The nobles stopped, and their hearer remained silent, 
 for some moments, ere he replied, with considerable stern- 
 ness : " 1 neither know, nor wish to know, your meaning, 
 gentlemen. I can imagine no ears, in which the name 
 of Zapola, should sound more bitterly, than in his, young 
 sir, whose father, by his traitorous deeds, brought on the 
 last illness of that good king; or his, my lord," (turning 
 to Balassi) " who was, himself, in open and avowed 
 hostility, at the time of John's decease," and saying 
 these words, the old chief, to abridge further communi- 
 cation, gave his steed the rein, and galloped off." 
 
 " Thank Heaven, he has left us," said Maylat; " he's 
 like an unstrung viol, that strikes too harsh a note, and 
 jars all ears alike. But ha ! what savage fellow's this?" 
 he suddenly exclaimed, waving his hand, with a gesture 
 of forbiddance. " Hold to your saddle, Balassi ! Stand 
 back, horrible abortion ! and fright not our horses from 
 their paces !" 
 
 This adjuration was addressed to a wild, and hirsute 
 object, which that instant darted into the midst, from 
 beyond the dark boles, that, in that quarter, walled in 
 the view. The figure was that of a man, round whose 
 loins was wrapt a fragment of goatskin, over which flowed 
 a loose cloak, of the same raw material. The arms, 
 feet, and legs, were bare, and the ghastliness of his as- 
 pect might be termed sepulchral. The long, elf locks, 
 guiltless of comb or scissors, descended, in sable flakes, 
 about his neck and shoulders, and hanging down, around 
 his extenuated and cadaverous visage, mingled with a 
 beard of extravagant length. The large, black eyes 
 rolled, with all that vague brilliancy and fire, alike akin 
 to genius, and madness ; and which almost seem proper 
 to the temperament of such zealots, as are inclined to in- 
 dulge, in the imprudent fervours of religion. His stature

 was of a height, tliat bordered on the gigantic ; and the 
 Jong strides of his sprawling limbs, followed one another 
 with such rapidity, that he measured the space between 
 the greenwood shade, and the young count, ere Maylat 
 had ceased speaking. 
 
 "Ha! know you not the renowned Dr. Stancari ?" 
 returned Balassi ; "who would mulct the Godhead of 
 two- thirds of his glory, although, in his single person, 
 he incarnates the triple spirit of law, divinity, and physic. 
 Dr. Stancari, the upholder of the divine right of ' the 
 powers that be:'* the army's leech, and, under favour 
 of his eminence be it spoken, their spiritual guide and 
 cynosure." 
 
 "His reverence's fame has spread far and wide," an- 
 swered Maylat, with affected deference, while his lip 
 scarcely curled, with an ironical smile ; "but I shame 
 to own, this is my first introduction." 
 
 "Doctor, what's in the wind," demanded Balassi; 
 " that you burst upon us so abruptly ?" 
 
 " I am emboldened herein," replied the learned Orson, 
 " even as one, who bringeth good tidings ; my feet have 
 been urged to the uttermost, yea, they have been unto 
 me, as the feet of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, and I 
 have not slackened my speed." 
 
 "Whence comest thou in such hot haste?" again in- 
 quired Balassi. 
 
 " From the half-tribe of Manassez," answered the ex- 
 aminate, after a long pause. 
 
 " Speak plain, man," cried Maylat; "what tribe?" 
 
 Stancari hesitated. " I come from the strong hold of 
 Coloswar," said he at length. 
 
 " At whose behest ?" again interrogated the chief. 
 
 " At that of his excellence, even Count Raoul, the 
 castellan of the city." 
 
 " Ha ! by what strategic didst contrive to elude the

 vigilance of the besiegers' outposts?" exclaimed Ba- 
 
 " That is a secret for the ears of the man of Baal." 
 
 " I wot not whom you mean," said Maylat; "there's 
 no such town as Baal, in all Hungary." 
 
 ** He stands arrayed in the gorgeous livery of Baby- 
 lon," continued Stancari. 
 
 '* The dog raves ; there's no such person !" cried 
 Maylat. 
 
 ** Who was't wrought great deeds in times past, and 
 even now, girdeth his loins, and hath set up a standard 
 in the land, and will, peradventure, work out the de- 
 livery of his country, even as Judas Maccabeus, the son 
 of Mattathias, saved Israel, of yore ? Verily, he is the 
 man I would behold." 
 
 " What does the arch-heretic prate of?" said Maylat. 
 
 " Heretic I" exclaimed the doctor, indignantly ; ** ay, 
 'tis the common term of ignominy on all, who dissent 
 from the abominations and authority of Antichrist." 
 
 " Methinks, thou art nearer Antichrist than any here, 
 you libellous charlatan ! What warrant have you for 
 preaching against his holiness the pope, and reviling the 
 blessed saints ?" 
 
 " My warrant is contained in the Book of Life !" 
 answered the doctor : " verily, I say unto you, I am one, 
 raised up to break in pieces the brazen serpent, and call 
 it Nehushtan, and to testify against the idolatries of 
 Bell, and point to the i?itegrosfo)ites, — shouting unto 
 ye aloud, ' Ho ! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the 
 waters.' " 
 
 *' A pretty pass for the church, truly," rejoined Balassi : 
 " if she heeded the invitation of visionaries like thee, 
 who haunt the path of paradise, and flutter, like the bee, 
 about its perennial blossoms, but, unlike the bee, only 
 to extract poison from their sweets ! Even John Huss, 
 whose unbelief brought him to the stake, spake re- 
 verently of the Holy Trinity ; but thou ! — what arch

 devil is't, that prompts thee to out -heretic the heretics, 
 and question the Godhead of Jesus Christ?"* 
 
 " Verily, is it not written," answered Dr. Stancari, 
 " * Unus est mediator Dei et hominum, homo Christus V — 
 homo — do you mark ; and again " 
 
 " Have done with thy blasphemous jargon!" inter- 
 rupted Maylat, '' and interpret thy tidings to us." 
 
 *' That were impossible," replied Stancari, '* inas- 
 much, as they are contained in a missive to your regent ; 
 — where shall I fall in with him ?" 
 
 *' Affairs of import detain his highness just now; but 
 you may relieve yourself of your commission, and we 
 will do your message," returned Balassi. 
 
 *' Verily, I ask not your aid," said Stancari ; " is not 
 your country desolate ? — your cities burned with fire ? — 
 do not strangers devour it in your presence ? — is it not 
 their overthrow? It is no small matter I am upon — I 
 will not be delayed — I will seek the man of Belial my- 
 self." 
 
 " Do you distrust us, Italian dunghill ?" hotly ex- 
 claimed Maylat. 
 
 " My lords," returned Stancari, " I am about the 
 embassage of the state, — stay me not." 
 
 On the word, the doctor hasted forwards, leaving his 
 noble interlocutors, for a moment, abaft and disconcerted, 
 looking like the " two witty peers" unto whom ** Johnny 
 Trott" *' taught a moral lesson," as reported among the 
 minor effusions of one of our most delightful versifiers. f 
 
 *' By heavens ! this cast will make or mar us," cried 
 Balassi, eagerly, standing on his stirrups, " the villain

 tially, is not within hail; stay here, — I'll be back on 
 the instant." 
 
 " What do you intend?" inquired Maylat, amazedly. 
 
 ** This is no moment for explanation," returned Ba- 
 lassi ; " only keep a strict look out, after the motions of 
 that heretic dog, — every thing depends on that ; this 
 hour is big with fate." So saying, Balassi galloped off, 
 at full speed, not waiting any answer. 
 
 The young graf, though without well apprehending the 
 purport of Balassi's directions, not the less attended the 
 progress of the doctor, with the utmost vigilance of his 
 eye. The rounded sun had disappeared amid the grate- 
 ful adieus of a thousand choristers, but something of his 
 glory remained behind, and yet gilded the loftier branches 
 of the forest, though his yellow light no longer yblent 
 the heavens with the earth, on whose bosom he had mo- 
 mentarily reposed. A few stars looked forth from the 
 chequered skies, athwart which, long fleecy streaks, that 
 had already discharged their cargo of precious hues, 
 swept hurriedly, and the wild figure of Stancari mingled 
 with the doubtful creations of twilight, and was soon 
 lost in the depths of shadowy earth, where stood the lofty 
 tent of Martinuzzi, rearing its snowy cone, in strong re- 
 lief against the blue horizon, still and silent, as a de- 
 serted palace. The cooler breath of twilight now wailed 
 mournfully, and freshened the sear and deepening woods, 
 whence Balassi reappeared, at the head of a small body 
 of men-at-arms, '' Whither," he asked impatiently, 
 '* has the savage betaken him ?" 
 
 Maylat, still doubtful of the other's purpose, indicated, 
 with his finger, the form of Stancari, darkening in the 
 gloom. 
 
 ''What! towards his highness' tent ?" exclaimed Ba- 
 lassi, in apparent apprehension; — ''Heaven avert the 
 traitor's purpose ! On ! lest worse befall." 
 
 The tv/o chiefs, having consigned their horses to the 
 care of some present, the whole body rapidly moved for-

 MANUSCRIPT XXI. 271 
 
 wards, in the direction pursued by Stancari. As they 
 were advancing- into the shadows of the camp, the mi- 
 litary made a sudden halt, and refused to introduce them- 
 selves to the inside of the tent. In vain Balassi remon- 
 strated ; they unanimously alleged their disinclination to 
 proceed, without the regent's command. 
 
 " What perverseness !" exclaimed Maylat ; *' the steel 
 of the assassin may be, even now, aimed at his eminence's 
 life!" 
 
 " The regent's orders are imperative, that none, on 
 any pretence, should intrude, whenever his pennon-stafF 
 is planted at the entrance of his tent," observed the 
 spokesman of the party. 
 
 The grafs retired a few paces, and conferred together 
 for an instant; then, bidding the men-at-arms remain 
 where they stood, they crept beneath the canvass en- 
 closure, and disappeared from view. The newly-pitched 
 tenement was spacious, and the shades of night wrapt 
 the apartment, wherein Maylat and Balassi now found 
 themselves, in deep gloom. For a minute after they re- 
 covered their erect attitude, the chiefs paused irresolute 
 under the canopy. They could perceive, by the aid of 
 a lamp, whose flickering light made half transparent the 
 veil-like partition, which divided the tent, the shade of a 
 solitary figure^ moving in the adjoining apartment. It 
 was, probably, the man they sought, but they could not 
 be sure, that it was not some different person. 
 
 " Keep guard here, and be still," said Balassi, to his 
 companion, in a hushed whisper ; then, on tiptoe, the 
 count crossed to the side, which was illumined by the 
 shadowy light, from the adjoining division. He drew his 
 sword, and cautiously made a slight rent, by pricking 
 the back curtain of the tent with his weapon. Placing 
 his eye against the aperture, he gazed into the apart- 
 ment. What he there beheld, apparently struck him 
 with amazement, and he slightly started back : the in- 
 voluntary movement attracted the attention of him within ;

 for, on Balassi again applying his orb of vision to the 
 canvass slit, he remarked that individual standing, in a 
 listening attitude, and the next moment, saw him step 
 forward, and put aside, a sort of figured hanging, which 
 served to conceal the communication between the two 
 divisions of the pavilion. 
 
 The count would now have silently effected his retreat, 
 but, in his first hurried movement to that end, he met with 
 an obstruction in a quarter, where he least looked for 
 it — he felt himself suddenly embraced, and his arms 
 pinioned forcibly to his side. At first, the graf 's idea was 
 that he was seized by Maylat. " Fire and furies ! are you 
 mad V he demanded in a suppressed voice. The curtain 
 at this moment being drawn aside, the broken ray from 
 beyond, sufficed to darkly shadow out the contending 
 figures. Maylat, sword in hand, rushed forward to assist 
 his friend ; it was but three paces, but ere that distance 
 could be measured, the weapon of Balassi, having been 
 wrested from his grasp, intercepted that of the graf 
 Maylat, against which it clashed in mortal combat. 
 
 The figure, standing within the curtained recess, re- 
 mained a silent, and seemingly unmoved spectator of the 
 inexplicable scene. Presently, a noise without, like the 
 gathering hum of armed footsteps, is heard, and the flame 
 of torches, flashing against the canvass walls of the tent, 
 gradually, though still dimly, lighted up the interior, — 
 there the confusion approaches its height, — Maylat lies 
 prostrate on the earth, and over him stood Dr. Stancari, 
 ready to strike. 
 
 '* Forbear!" exclaimed the individual within the en- 
 trance, in a commanding tone. 
 
 The victor reverted his head, and, at that moment, 
 Balassi, having recovered from his first surprise, seized 
 with vigour, the doctor's extended arm, and raised his 
 poignard to end the strife at a blow. As Stancari stag- 
 gered, and fell senseless by the side of his late antagonist, 
 that chieftain, profiting by his opportunity, raised himself

 MANUSCRIPT XX r. 273 
 
 to his feet and made off, at the same entrance, by which 
 he had introduced himself. Balassi was in the act of 
 stepping after him, when a sealed paper, lying near the 
 spot, where he and Dr. Stancari first struggled in the 
 dark, caught his eye, and with a joyful exclamation, he 
 rushed back to obtain possession of it. The individual, 
 who had hitherto remained stationary, now, for the first 
 time, as if interested in that sudden action, measured a 
 few paces, and then stooped, with the apparent view of 
 frustrating Balassi's purpose ; — but the count, having 
 secured the paper, before the other could anticipate his 
 movement, quickly regained the same point of egress, 
 by which Maylat eiFected his retreat. He lifted the can- 
 vass, beneath which he had already half thrust his body, 
 when another person shoved aside an opposite entrance, 
 and passing into the pavilion, commanded the count to 
 stay. The organ tones of that voice were neither to be 
 mistaken nor disobeyed, and Balassi remained momen- 
 tarily transfixed, as by a spear. 
 
 " Quick, quick ! my friend," cried Maylat, from with- 
 out, at the same time grasping the graf 's wrist. Resolving 
 on his line of conduct with the quickness of thought, 
 Balassi slipped the missive of Stancari, into the other's 
 extended hand, accompanying the consignment with the 
 deep significant whisper — " Fly ! attend our appoint- 
 ment !" Then dropping the canvass, the graf drew back 
 into the tent, and stood, resolved and silent, in the pre- 
 sence of Martinuzzi. 
 
 The regent eyed him sternly for an instant, and after- 
 wards held serious, but brief discourse, with the other 
 tenant of the pavilion. " I deeply regret this matter, 
 sir," said Martinuzzi, " and, credit me, the more so, that 
 I forbear, since it appears to be your will, alluding to 
 the high honour, conferred by such unexampled confi- 
 dence, and to my commensurate shame at this obtrusion. 
 Would Abu Obeidah deign to signify his wishes, in re-

 spect to the inexplicable occurrence of this last lialf- 
 hour ?" 
 
 " Your eminence commands here," replied the Emir, 
 with a faint smile, and an obeisance even more dubious, 
 then, after a pause he added — " You should be informed, 
 however, that that gentleman hath obtained a letter, it 
 may be of importance, which I rather think dropped from 
 the girdle of the man, he hath slain." 
 
 " Francis Stancari," said Martinuzzi, casting his eyes 
 on the bloody corpse, ever a follower of camps, with the 
 fiendish hope of contaminating the souls of the men, by 
 his pestilent heresies — otherwise, a faithful servant of his 
 adopted country. I have proved that man — may the 
 mercy of Christ yet save his immortal part ! The charita- 
 ble sentiment fell meekly from his lips, while a corres- 
 pondent feeling spake in his gestures, and beamed in the 
 mild light of his eye." An expression of derisive scorn 
 traversed, like a cloud, the imperious visage of the Emir — 
 he moved away in silence. " But what did I hear ?" 
 presently exclaimed the regent — " a missive ! it must be 
 the dispatch, I looked for by this time, from Quendi 
 Ferrens — my lord Balassi, I will thank you for it." 
 
 " Your eminence must needs seek elsewhere," replied 
 Balassi, nothing daunted; ^' the letter in request is beyond 
 my power to get at." 
 
 " How sir !" ejaculated Mat-tinuzzi. 
 
 Abu Obeida slowly turned about, and looked fixedly 
 in the face of the graf, who remained mute. 
 
 '' Do you dare dispute our commands?" said Marti- 
 nuzzi, and his voice trembled with emotion. 
 
 " Your jurisdiction herein, my lord," replied Balassi, 
 with an appearance of perfect firmness, "is as bounded 
 as your power. I demur to the one ; for what right have 
 you to a letter, unless you can show it to be your property ? 
 Providence circumscribes the other, for that letter is not 
 in my possession."

 " In Stamboul,"* remarked Abu Obeida, addressing the 
 surprised and indignant regent, " we are more expert at 
 determining rare differences between authority and trea- 
 son. The twang of the bow-string never fails to convince 
 those refractory slaves, whom rebel inclinations have 
 drawn from their allegiance." 
 
 Martinuzzi bit his lip, and was about to speak, but the 
 impetuous chief again took up the word — " and glad will 
 the tyrant Kanounyf be, when the argument of the bow- 
 string shall be the sole code of Erdely, and his capigee 
 pashi, the only law-giver. Will he not, think you, sir 
 Turk ?" 
 
 The blood of the Emir rushed into his face, and flushed 
 his swarthy visage, while the big veins of his forehead, 
 like corded lines, swelled beneath his green turban, 
 almost to bursting. At first he motioned his hand, quicker 
 than light to his weapon ; but as instantaneously with- 
 drawing it, he stood mute and moveless, whilst the im- 
 patient curl of his lip, the heaving of his chest, the in- 
 dignant breathing from the distended nostril, and the 
 bloodshot eyes, rolling with hyena-like ferocity, belied his 
 constrained silence. 
 
 Whatever impression the retorts of Balassi made on 
 Abu Obeida, it could hardly parallel the confusion, which 
 every muscle and movement of Martinuzzi betrayed. 
 " Bold traitor ! you give an undue licence to your tongue !" 
 he exclaimed, in an imperative, though choaked voice,., 
 choaked with conflicting emotions, that he could not re- 
 concile, nor keep down. Then turning to the Ottoman, he 
 said in a deprecatory tone — " You perceive how power- 
 less I am herein, and are too magnanimous, to attribute 
 the saucy diatribe of a factious regicide to my discredit, 
 with the mighty sultan Solyman." 
 
 Abu Obeida scowled upon both with eye of death — his 
 
 * Constantinople. 
 
 t Kanouny : Solyman — so sum araed from his having iutroJuced the 
 use of cannon in Turkey.

 slippered right foot beat nervously, against the rough 
 dolman of the murdered preacher, and he muttered be- 
 tween his teeth, with contemptuous force, — '' Powerless, 
 truly !" 
 
 Martinuzzi, meanwhile, stood directly in the line of 
 fire of both, exposed to the consequences of their reci- 
 procal animosity. 
 
 *' A factious regicide !" repeated Balassi, fiercely — 
 " take back the discourteous charge — regicide ! arrogant 
 prelate ! who most merits that appellative ? He, who has 
 at length thrown off the mask, when it has become too 
 threadbare for use, and avows his design on the crown of 
 Hungary ! — He, who, even now, men say, is compassing, 
 how to glue that type of sovereignty to his traitor brow, 
 in the blood of her highness, the lady Czerina, who, when 
 a child, so mysteriously escaped the machinations of her 
 guardian's black confessor, in the vaults of Hermanstadt : 
 ^— Is not such an one a regicide, rather than myself, who 
 would peril my life to avert the destruction, which hangs 
 over my queen ?" 
 
 Martinuzzi was evidently much agitated ; his breast 
 heaved with convulsive throes, and his eyes wandered 
 from the chieftain to the Emir, and then back, but what- 
 ever were his thoughts, he did not arrange them into 
 speech, while, after a pause, Balassi again broke forth — 
 
 *' Time and circumstance have all but sapped the feeble 
 bulwark, your hypocrisy had erected round the truth. 
 Think you, that men do not see through your purpose, in 
 relieving Coloswar ? There is the regalia ! Oh, 'tis too 
 palpable ! where are now the columns of the land, who 
 should uphold the throne of Hungary ? Struck ! crum- 
 bled ! utterly fallen ! — Where Pereny? in Vienna, the 
 tenant of a dungeon, or a tomb, — by whose intrigues ? 
 — Where the constable Vicchy? outlawed. — Where Turas- 
 cus? dreaming of the palatinate, under the reign of 
 Martinuzzi! — Where my friend, the noble Maylat ? — 
 Where ? answer thou, infidel !" He proceeded more vehe-

 mently, approaching the Emir, — ''decoyed by the bloody 
 Peter, and assassinated by the Basha of Buda ! — was 
 he not? at the command of the circumcised despot of the 
 East ? — but by whose intrigue, hey, my lord cardinal ? — 
 ah ! there's the point." 
 
 It would have been in vain to attempt to stem this tide 
 of invective, at the flood ; and the extreme passion of Abu 
 Obeida grew every moment more decidedly irrepressible. 
 He shook with suppressed rage, from limb to limb, and 
 his livid features betrayed a strange mixture of wrath 
 and menace. 
 
 Martinuzzi kept his eye fearfully upon the Emir, as he 
 raised the canvass, and called out, in a feeble voice, 
 " What, ho ! my guard there!" At the word, a dozen 
 men-at-arms passed into the pavilion. " Attach that 
 gentleman," said Martinuzzi. The soldiers closed round 
 Balassi. " Search," continued the regent, with some 
 eagerness, though the tones of his voice were faint, " if 
 there be a letter about his person." 
 
 The order was observed, and a narrow scrip of paper 
 was delivered into Martinuzzi's hands. He rapidly 
 glanced his eye over it. " Fail not to rendezvous at mid- 
 night at the old hut in the forest glen. — Alaric Polgar." 
 
 Martinuzzi heaved a deep sigh, whilst a serener, though 
 perhaps, more mournful expression, succeeded the pre- 
 vious working of his wan features. With bland address, 
 he turned to Abu Obeida, and again essayed to appease 
 the storm, that Balassi had conjured in the Emir's bosom. 
 " I have arrested the libellous traitor, gracious sir," he 
 said, *' even at the risk of giving further offence, by the 
 obtrusion of my guard. Will you instruct me, how I can 
 best wipe out the remembrance of this unfortunate bu- 
 siness ?" 
 
 Abu Obeida hardly stirred. At first, he only replied 
 by that withering and bitter smile, with which he was 
 wont to intimate his mortal resentment, and which, like 
 the play of the lightning round some hideous monument,

 only rendered more ghastly the fierce immobility of his 
 countenance. He stood, coiled up in the folds of his 
 still soul, from whose dark recess he sent forth his gleam- 
 ing eyes, and fixed them on those of Martinuzzi. The 
 regent started. There was a dangerous import in that 
 wild, dark, and vindictive gaze, which his soul refused 
 to read, and he waited, with painful forebodings, the 
 explanation. '' Regent of Hungary," answered the Emir, 
 at length, speaking between his ground teeth, *' whether 
 this insult was planned, I cannot tell ; — perhaps not — 
 I think not ; but your honour demands your conceding 
 the utmost satisfaction in your power, and, however in- 
 adequate such atonement, I will even try to forget this 
 night's deadly affront. I have, I see, exposed myself to 
 opprobrium, and — but enough — you will grant me all, 
 I have a right to demand." 
 
 'Mn what way can 1 evince my regret?" inquired 
 Martinuzzi, in a faltering voice. 
 
 " Order yon officer, to cleave, at a stroke of his sabre, 
 the villain's head, from off his shoulders," replied Abu 
 Obeida, with dreadful calmness, though in that autho- 
 ritative voice, that was rarely disobeyed. 
 
 Martinuzzi recoiled in person, as in spirit. Almost 
 instantly, however, he resumed his dignified and upright 
 attitude, and thus, with a countenance, beaming with 
 contempt of consequences, and in tones, that gathered 
 firmness, as he proceeded, made answer, — '* That I am 
 innocent in this matter, I hope I need not asseverate ; 
 that I most deeply regret your haying been subjected to 
 such indignity, more especially when confiding your per- 
 son to my hospitality, and honour, I will not repeat. How 
 much it is my interest, at this moment, to draw still 
 closer the ties, between myself and the magnificent sultan, 
 instead of weakening their force, I am scarcely igno- 
 rant; but, at the same time, — pardon me, gracious sir, 
 — though this place privilege thee, thou hast presumed

 too far. Heaven witness for me ! while I have breath to 
 protest against the ignominy, never shall nobleman of 
 Hungary and Transylvania, receive sentence of death at 
 the mandate of a foreigner ; still less would I endure 
 to be an accomplice in the deed, even though — again, 
 pardon me, sir," — he added, with a slow inclination of 
 a head, that seldom bent to power, — " the mighty So- 
 lyman himself dared insult George Martinuzzi, by such 
 a proposition." 
 
 The picture of baffled vengeance, that the gestures 
 and countenance of Abu Obeida exhibited, was only the 
 more striking, from the evident exertion of the Emir, to 
 rein in his passion, or, at least, to prevent its excess be- 
 coming visible. Perhaps, for the first time in his life, he 
 found himself in a situation, where his will was not para- 
 mount, and where the extreme licence of his vindictive 
 disposition was set bounds to, by the resolute determi- 
 nation of another. The lesson was, at once, a memorable, 
 and an excellent one ; but, unfortunately, it stood alone, 
 in a long career of irresponsible selfishness, and only 
 irritated the wild beast, the drjpiov* of despotism, it was 
 not likely to chasten or subdue. The frenzy of his in- 
 tolerable rage threatened to tear him asunder, and, whilst 
 he yet shook, in this state of nervous excitement, Balassi 
 again addressed him. 
 
 " So, sanguinary infidel !" he tauntingly cried, " his 
 eminence understands his position better, than to share 
 his justice-seat with thee, or thy inhuman master. Tran- 
 sylvania is so far free, and the gallant Maylat's mur- 
 derer " 
 
 " Sends thee to hell, fool !" interrupted Abu Obeida, 
 darting, like lightning, on the imprisoned chief. Se- 
 conding the word with the action, he plunged his glit- 
 tering hangier, which he suddenly displayed, into the

 broad chest of the Hungarian. Balassi tottered for a 
 moment, and then fell back into the arms of the guard, 
 deluging them with blood. 
 
 It was the deed of an instant. The soldiers, rallying 
 from their consternation, were in the act of laying hands 
 on the Emir, when Martinuzzi commanded them to look 
 to the wounded prisoner. The Emir, returning his 
 hangier to its sheath, slowly retired to the adjoining 
 apartment. Martinuzzi bent over the dying count. Life 
 was not yet extinct, but the flux of blood was so great, 
 that a speedy dissolution was inevitable. 
 
 " Have you aught to say, or any request to make?" 
 inquired the cardinal, with pitying tenderness of voice 
 and manner. 
 
 " Only this," replied Balassi, in the feeble accents of 
 death, — " it is rumoured abroad, that you intend to 
 force her highness to wed the Austrian secretary, — is it 
 true V 
 
 " Suppose it were, can it concern you at such a mo- 
 ment? — think of your own immortal interests," answered 
 Martinuzzi, raising a crucifix on high. 
 
 " Nay, speak to that point, I prithee, — is it true !"

 " Change your purpose, then, I conjure you, by that

 They were the last words he uttered. The next mi- 
 nute, the flame of the lamp of Balassi's life was ex- 
 tinct. 
 
 Martinuzzi left the tent, wrapped in moody abstraction.

 Some hours may have elapsed, since the spirit of the 
 gallant Balassi took its flight, when the broad circle of 
 the moon, rising, like a sanguine shield, in the distant 
 skies, dimly illuminated the tall form of a man, hurrying 
 along the margin of the Samos, where one branch of the 
 divided river broke, with a shallow murmur, over the 
 sandy shore. The rapidity of his pace seemed to evince, 
 that the business he was on, was more than commonly 
 urgent, while his availing himself of every advantage of 
 cover, which the superincumbent cliff, or jutting crags, 
 occasionally presented, betrayed his consciousness, that 
 it was of a nature, requiring caution and concealment. 
 The long, black gaberdine, girdled round the waist, and 
 the immense cocked-hat, hanging over the forehead, 
 proclaimed, at once, the religion and the race of the 
 wear.er. His dress and appearance, bespoke the itinerant 
 Jew trader, whom not the extreme risk of life and lucre,*

 could deter from perambulating- tlie country, and hang- 
 ing on the skirts of armies, to purchase the spoils of the 
 soldiers. 
 
 Under pretence of carrying on their customary traffic 
 in old iron, the Hebrew people would often draw forth 
 from their wallets, articles of great rarity and value, — 
 the plunder of camps and cities. The night was pecu- 
 liarly calm and serene, and the quiet, starlit view, far 
 from unpleasing. In the distance, dominated the stern 
 towers and battlements of Coloswar ; their tall, dark 
 masses, dimly painted against the blue sky ; and, with- 
 out the city walls, from which, in those days, the edi- 
 fice was even more completely cut off, by a branch of 
 the Samos, the tapering spires of the venerable abbey, 
 tipped by the grey moonlight, glanced, wan and spectral, 
 in mid-air. The watch-fires of the imperial encamp- 
 ment gleamed, with obscure lustre, on the high down 
 afar off; and the spreading roofs of the warlike tenements, 
 which distance, and the efi'ulgent light, turned to silver, 
 whitened the rising grounds ; while, along the opposite 
 shore of the Samos, the bosom of the clear stream mir- 
 rored the scattered trees, that skirted irregularly its 
 banks, amid the illumination of innumerable bonfires, 
 that darted their glowing light, across the undulating 
 surface of the water. These had been kindled by the 
 peasantry, at a little distance from the course of the 
 river, as snares for cray-fish. 
 
 We have said the night was calm ; but it was redeemed 
 from lonesomeness, by the low murmur that, rolling off 
 from the imperial camp, floated on the air, like the ex- 
 pressive voice of silence. All was hushed, in unison with 
 the still slumbering scenery, and noontide hour, save when 
 occasionally a bird was heard, hoarsely booming among 
 the shallows, and the sound of creeping wavelets, as they 
 just kissed the shore, and sunk to sleep with their own 
 fruition, fell softly on the sense, like die-away-lovers' 
 sighs; or when, at due intervals, the monotonous chal-

 lenge of the sentinel along the ramparts, came mellowed 
 by distance on the ear, returned by the single doleful 
 howl of many a wakeful wolf-dog, from within the city, 
 and the adjacent country. The Israelite pursued his 
 undeviating path, for more than a mile alongside the 
 river, when a curvature of its banks brought him within 
 point of view of a small skiff, seemingly floating at rest, 
 on the limpid bosom of the water, within a stone's throw 
 off the shore. 
 
 "This is most opportune," said the wayfarer to him- 
 self. " In the neighbourhood of Coloswar, on the eve of 
 battle, and at such an hour too ! However, it will save me 
 a full league from a wetting, though the fellow standing 
 in that bark, methinks, must have addled his wits, to 
 loiter there, it might have been till the new moon, waiting 
 for a fare." 
 
 Thus marvelling in his own mind, our traveller reached 
 the point where the lesser stream was lost in the greater, 
 and there, beneath the shadow of a conspicuous rock, 
 the tall and erect form of the ferryman could faintly be 
 distinguished, at the further end of the vessel. 
 
 " Ho! paddle in, Charon," shouted the Jew. 
 
 The other answered the hail, by steering his slightly- 
 built boat to the w^ater's edge. — *' Walter, is it you ? 
 Have you struck the blow ?" he demanded, with breath- 
 less articulation, as he hove up out of the gloom. 
 
 The Hebrew did not appear to catch the inquiry, but 
 strode nearer the boat. — " What may be the rate of pas- 
 sage across," he asked, somewhat authoritatively. 
 
 There was a considerable pause before the waterman 
 again spoke. — " That varies with time and circumstance, 
 and the quality of my cargo to boot," he at length 
 replied ; raising himself upright in his frail canoe." At 
 extra hours, like these, I waft over your dolbatsche* for

 partly, a few dry cuffs with the reverse of my helve, by

 they go gratis, for old fellowship sake. Under which 
 head am I to class you, sir traveller ?" 
 
 " Under the last named, my prince of ferrymen," cried 
 the other, incontinently leaping into the light Avherry, 
 which shook with the impulse of his bound ; " so a free 
 freight, and a quick one, for I promise you, my minutes, 
 this night, are too precious to be squandered on inac- 
 tion." 
 
 *' How !" cried the other, " what manner of man art 
 thou, who claimest the freedom of my bark, yet neither 
 knowest our pass-word, nor wearest Christian clothing? 
 Go to — thou art but a Jew !" 
 
 " And so shouldst thou be, by thy unbelief," returned 
 the traveller; " but behold ! what think you now ?" 
 
 On saying these words the false Jew unbuckled the 
 girdle, that made fast his gaberdine, and threw open the 
 dark disguisement. Immediately, the characteristic, 
 and splendid vestures of a banditti chieftain caught, and 
 reflected back the rays from above. 
 
 *' By Heavens ! Count Polgar !" was the irrepressible, 
 though half-smothered ejaculation of the boatman. 
 
 "Ha! my bon commorado, we are acquainted it 
 seems," exclaimed the Cygani leader, for it was even he ;

 The track of the canoe furrowed the sparkling 
 stream, with a long line of silvered foam, that shone in 
 the moonshine, like the floating scales of some river ser- 
 pent, ere the boatman made answer. 
 
 " Nevertheless, I have lodged, of late, in your cunicu- 
 lar fortress, not a furlong from yon encampment." 
 
 " So lately trusted, and at large !" thought Count 
 Ragotzy, fixing his dark eyes intently on the person of 
 the individual, engaged in propelling the light skiff over 
 the water. 
 
 The man was clothed in the common habiliments, 
 which distinguished the kayiactz, or cattle-keeper of the 
 woods of Erdely. The sort of greasy and capacious hose, 
 that encased his legs ; the broad belt, set off with its 
 triple row of metal buttons ; the tough elm staff in- 
 serted therein, whose nether appendage of rusty iron, 
 gifted it with something of the utility, though not the 
 appearance of an axe ; the tattered dolman of woollen 
 cloth ; the round felt hat, guiltless of a plume, and 
 which, be-ribboned with all the colours of the rainbow, 
 looked '' like a black eye in a recent scuffle ;" the lea- 
 ther strapped about the feet, just as the missionary Van- 
 derkemp describes the shoes of the CafFres : — all these 
 were points of costume peculiar to the kanactz, but were 
 any thing, rather than characteristic of the garb of a ferry- 
 man of Coloswar. The front rim of the hat overshadowed 
 the upper part of the man's face, and the cape of the 
 mantle was contrivedly wrapt in such a manner, as to 
 muffle his more subordinate features. 
 
 " It is not an age since you learned to feather your 
 oars on these rapids, to judge by your vestments," said 
 Count Ragotzy. 
 
 ** My vestments," repeated the other, in an altered 
 tone, '' sooth to say, I selected them from your lordship's 
 miscellaneous wardrobe, and, for my skill at my oar, 
 'twill improve by practice. To be plain with you, know, 
 you are my first freight. I was, indeed, about to cross

 on my own account, when your lordship came within 
 hail." 
 
 " By H — 11 ! I should know that voice," cried Ragotzy ; 
 " and yet it cannot be." 
 
 " You are right, Lord Ragotzy," returned the other. 
 ** Fate, for once, is impartial : the renowned Egyptian 
 and his lunatic captive, are embarked on the same bot- 
 tom. Keep your seat steady. Lord Ragotzy, or, by the 
 Holy Trinity ! we both find land, where one of us, at 
 least, would be loth to look for it." 
 
 The brigand chief mastered his first emotion, and, 
 without speaking, occupied himself in re-buckling the 
 broad girdle of his long black vest. 
 
 At the earnest request of his mother. Count Ragotzy 
 had embraced Swartz's proposal to carry off Sigismund 
 with him, to his robber-hold. Unna had since repeatedly 
 urged on her son, that on no account, should he suffer 
 the releasfe of the unhappy possessor of the title of the mur- 
 dered Count Rodna ; she even exhorted him, rather than 
 permit the youth's escape, to terminate his imprisonment 
 in his blood. In conformity with these objurgations, 
 though without at all apprehending their import, Ragotzy 
 modelled his proceedings ; and, on his having to return 
 to Hermanstadt, with the view of compassing the abduc- 
 tion of Veronica, he had left the youth under the strictest 
 surveillance of his band. Nevertheless, Sigismund con- 
 trived, during the brief absence of the Cygani leader, to 
 give his guards the slip, and Ragotzy had remained, in 
 ignorance of his fate, till the present encounter. 
 
 These explanations premised, we return to our story. 
 The brigand and the young count had each his own 
 anxious thoughts, on the subject of their meeting, — 
 thoughts which neither cared to express in words. 
 
 " Now, in the Mano's name !" said the Cygani, inter- 
 nally, *' what conjuration brings that youtli, at such an 
 hour before my eyes ? Were it only for the interest my 
 mother takes in him, I'll sift out his purposes, if, per-

 adventure, his scattered faculties can be brought to any 
 defined point." 
 
 '^ He answers me not," said Sigismund, (the argument 
 of whose thoughts, we thus woukl render into a con- 
 nected meaning) — " absent all day — so much I learned 
 from Walter, who, I pray Heaven, miss not this op- 
 portunity through any inadvertence ! But whither has 
 the Cygani been ? — doubtless, in Coloswar — his busi- 
 ness there ? and the name of his confederate ? Ha ! that 
 it imports my knowing ; but, above all, his present 
 errand — alone, at midnight ! — I must, and will under- 
 stand that, — or else, after all, my long apprenticeship to 
 dissimulation, and this last device, in hopes of meriting 
 the gratitude of wretched Erdely, may prove a vain offer- 
 ing at the altar of my country. The regalia is in his 
 possession. Oh, just Heaven! if I only knew where he 
 had concealed the treasure, w^itness for me, that that 
 fiend, in human shape, should not survive this meeting ; 
 but, however hard, I must yet dissemble ; down, indig- 
 nant heart ! — 'tis not for long." 
 
 " 1 would fain inquire, what you have been doing with 
 yourself, young gentleman, since you thought fit to de- 
 camp last week V asked Ragotzy, after a minute's rumi- 
 nation. " Did you dislike your reception amongst us, or 
 deem your subterraneous lodgment less adapted to sub- 
 lime and pious contemplation, than that trembling tower 
 of Hermanstadt, where v/e first became acquainted V 
 
 " Nay, for that matter, you speak in ignorance," 
 observed Sigismund, — " I have this day learned a strange 
 truth. Lord Ragotzy, which — but that m.atters not. 
 Credit me, our first introduction occurred long before 
 the time you name, and was attended by circumstances, 
 that I will not now recall, lest — what have I been doing, 
 do you ask ? — roaming about, a sort of volunteer guerilla, 
 but under orders all the while, mind me ; I only changed 
 your service for a better." 
 
 '' Say you so, my captious hero," returned Ragotzy ;

 ** and what chieftain has the happiness to enrol you, 
 among his warriors ?" 
 
 '* The Richter Iwan," replied Sigismund. 
 
 Rag'otzy lowered his brows. — '' Ha! the slaughterer of 
 the brave Peter," he cried, " and my bitterest foe !" 
 
 *' Dost thou then hate him, with such good-will?" 
 demanded Sigismund. 
 
 *' Do I not ? — but he will die one of these days, an-d 
 you may acquaint him, that I, Count Polgar, foretell his 
 fate." 
 
 " 'Tis a gipsy's prediction," replied Sigismund, '^ and 
 the Richter is not a person to give faith to your people's 
 prophetic pretensions. Nevertheless, I'll do your mes- 
 sage ; — shall I say Heaven is to close his mortal course ?" 
 
 " Heaven !" repeated Ragotzy, with vehemence ; " ay. 
 Heaven and I will." 
 
 Sigismund half brought into light the axe by his side, 
 fixing an inquiring eye upon the weapon, and then trans- 
 ferring the look to Count Ragotzy, as if to ask his 
 meaning. A smile of bitter acknowledgment lit up the 
 face of the brigand. 
 
 " Oh, I understand you better," said the youth, " you 
 would have me bear your cartel to Iwan, so, content ye; 
 but where is your gage? Receive this, as that of the 
 Richter — 'tis tlie badge of his troop, and only do you 
 wear it on your helm, in battle, and the singular recol- 
 lections connected with it, will cause him to recognise it 
 among a thousand cognizances, and claim it of you, 
 doubt not, though there opposed a barrier of steel be- 
 twixt you twain." Thus saying, Sigismund placed his 
 hand within his vest, and drew forth a fragment of tar- 
 tan, which he presented to Count Ragotzy, who, in re- 
 turn, banded him a valuable brooch, such as was com- 
 monly used by the superior chiefs and magnats, with 
 which to clasp a peacock's feather, in their morion or 
 calpac. 
 
 *f Be it a challenge, though I meant it not," answered

 the brigand, throwing himself carelessly back upon the 
 seat. " Let Richter Iwan sport this jewel in my sight, 
 and I will pluck it from his front, though he stood bul- 
 warked by the choicest, that now lie couched upon their 
 arms in yonder camp, or, if your chief incline to the 
 usurper, though the body-guard of Martinuzzi, hemmed 
 him round ." 
 
 There was a moment's pause, which Ragotzy broke ; 
 ^' Why dost make believe to be mad?" he demanded. 
 
 " 'Cause I would live : art not answered ? 'Cause I 
 would live," replied Sigismund. 
 
 *' But what means this ?" cried the other. " How came 
 your gage bloodied with gore." 
 
 •' 'Tis imbrued in human blood," said Sigismund, in a 
 low and altered voice. 
 
 " I'd swear," rejoined Count Ragotzy, " the Richter 
 had gained, and I lost, a treasure in you ; but that many 
 a year has pass'd, since this life-stream dyed the tartan." 
 
 " Now, in my eyes, it looks as fresh as yesterday," re- 
 sponded Sigismund, with deep pathos ; — " but, prithee," 
 presently broke from his livid lip, with wild abruptness, 
 " prithee, hide it beneath thy gaberdine — I'm faint to 
 see it in thy hands — it turns my very soul to its own 
 likeness — I'm sick, — there, 'twas a ray of the moon, 
 that struck my brain; but, now, God be praised ! a cloud 
 obscures her disk — this bonfire will better aid your de- 
 barkation. So, one stroke more. We are on terra 
 firm a, my lord." As these last words fell from his lips, 
 the light vessel shot on the pebbly beach. 
 
 "The youth may be distraught, as 'tis given out; 
 though, that he hath lucid intervals, is pretty evident," 
 thought Ragotzy, as he leaped on shore. " His phan- 
 tasie is after a fashion of his own, I trow, and, it is 
 likely, is more than half pretence. Well, what the devil 
 is't to me? and why should I, at such a time as this, flog 
 my wits, in the vain endeavour to penetrate, respecting 
 the reality of his madness, or his motives for deception ?

 I must banish these obtruding fancies, that grow upon 
 my spirits, like a trouble ; I have work on hand." Then 
 addressing himself to Sigismund, he cried, ** Thanks for 
 your passage, follower of Iwan, — be advised and return 
 to me — you will be welcome back to the band of Ra- 
 gotzy, when your present chief shall fall by my hand." 
 
 *' Assuredly we shall meet again," observed Sigismund, 
 with careless indifference of voice. 
 
 The brigand made no reply, and Sigismund silently 
 motioned him to depart. After remaining for more than a 
 minute resting on his oars, our hero suddenly started to 
 his feet, and his eyes strained after the form of the count, 
 as it receded, like a shadow, in the pale and doubtful 
 moonlight. *' I must discover, what brings him from 
 over the water," said the youth, in a low indrawn voice. 
 '^ I risk much, though Walter may not arrive, ere I get 
 back ; but, whether or no, I must e'en follow in the 
 trail of the serpent." Intent on this object, Sigismund 
 drew the light fabric into a little creek, among a tall 
 growth of flags and reeds, and there attached it by a 
 rope, to an amphibious branch of weeping ash, which, 
 mostly stripped of its leaves, lay half afloat upon the 
 water — 
 
 *' Ever and anon, 
 When the slow lazy breeze came muttering by, 
 The frail stems bowed, and dipped their long bright leaves, "' 
 Like hair below the water." * 
 
 Balancing his axen staff lightly in his hand, our hero 
 left the soft light of the moon, to pursue, slowly, and 
 with caution, the gloomy and half- worn path, so narrow 
 as to be almost imperceptible, which had been followed 
 by the Cygani leader. After traversing the woods for the 
 better part of an hour, his course led, by a devious and 
 tangled descent of close underwood, into a lonely glen, 
 where the waving shadows of long rank grasses swept

 sullenly over a broad sheet of stagnant bog, feebly irra- 
 diated by the pale moon, that gleamed, and trembled on 
 its quaking waters. Near the edge of this swamp, might 
 be discerned, a large oak tree, blasted, and of extraor- 
 dinary magnitude. Not far from thence, stood a single 
 low hut, raised partly of stone, piles of which were lying 
 around the whole exterior, — but it was chiefly constructed 
 of the grouted fragments of a conventual building, situ- 
 ated little more than a hundred yards higher up, and 
 which, however dilapidated, retained sufficient proof of 
 the ancient magnificence of the structure. These ruinous 
 materials were irregularly put together, and exhibited 
 but small evidence of masonic skill. It was thither, 
 making, however, a considerable detour, that Count Ra- 
 gotzy held on his course. 
 
 Lonely was the spot ; breathing and deep, the silence, 
 in which it slept. The melancholy, gaunt, cold aspect of 
 the dilapidated structure, where the hallowing light 
 sharpened, to a more fine and etherial radiance, the 
 wrought edges and tracery of the time-worn pediments 
 and friezes ; the low-eaved hovel, beyond which the 
 immemorial trees rose, apparently into the heavens ; 
 the black, close, huge, woods, environing the morass, and 
 waving their implicated boughs, in harmony with the 
 wind, as it swept their depths, and sighed among their 
 precarious foliage, conspired to impress the mind of Si- 
 gismund with a feeling of deep solitude; while the deso- 
 late rustling of the withered leaves under-foot, and the 
 absence of all appearance of animation, save that of the 
 spectral form of Ragotzy, side by side with his tall sha- 
 dow, like an aerial companion, gliding along the little 
 woodpath to his appointment, were calculated still more 
 to deepen such a sensation. It was so far favourable 
 to our hero's object, that the daring man, on whose track 
 he ventured, traced the mazes of his intricate course, 
 witliout reverting his head ; for frequently he diverged 
 from the dwarf copses, composed of pale green oak, of

 withered beach, and of other infant tenants of the forest, 
 into the broad moonlight, and the blind and tangled 
 thickets, through which, Sigismund sought his way, 
 though they did not wholly expose his person, would 
 hardly have hidden him from the brigand's sight, had he 
 chanced to look behind, in the direction of, his pursuer. 
 
 At length Count Ragotzy reached the ruinous hut, and 
 stood in the door-way. He turned, and sent his eye 
 abroad, suffering the dark orb to rest for a moment, ab- 
 stractedly, on a scene, which the ghostly colouring of the 
 still gelid moon,* mingling v/ith the sickly light of mid- 
 night, only rendered more dispiriting, and more desolate. 
 The site of this sequestered spot, — the dark pool, — the 
 deserted hut, — the eddying of the withered foliage, which 
 broke the death-like stillness of the vast forest, — the 
 horror umbrariwi on every side, had something in them, 
 impressive and awful to the imagination. Whether out- 
 ward objects, or the remembrances they suggested, 
 weaved the tliick gathering clouds, which at that lonely 
 hour, dulled the mental light of the Cygani, we cannot 
 tell, — from whatever cause, he felt an unwonted depres- 
 sion darkening his mind, like the shadow of a coming 
 evil. Striving to shake off the gloomy presentiment, he 
 peered into the dark waveless waters of that solitary pool, 
 whose depths had all the character of a submarine fir- 
 mament. The limpid fount was spangled with mimic 
 stars, and mirrored the moon, as she sailed along in her 
 placid beauty. Ragotzy gazed long and thoughtfully, 
 till the planet seemed to grow on his sight, and her broad 
 disk bore the semblance of a human countenance, — he 
 looked hard on the visage, with that sort of creative spell, 
 made up of incredulity and fancy, and he could gradually 
 trace all its lineaments, till at last, to his consternation, 
 he recognised in the face, a likeness of himself. Appalled 
 by his own gloomy imagination, he raised his eyes from

 the mocking- vision, to the moon in heaven, as if to 
 certify himself of the fact, or dispel the illusion. Even 
 as the rays from above fell directly on his dark fiery eyes, 
 he obtained a transient view of a moving form, which a 
 peculiarly bright glimpse of moonlight now showed him, 
 a short way off, gliding among the shadows of a group of 
 copse-oak wood. " 'Tis either the graf Maylat or the graf 
 Balassi," he thought to himself, as without stopping to 
 gaze further at the planet, or her terrible reflection in the 
 sedgy quagmire, he passed beneath the low portal of the 
 hut. He had scarcely measured three steps in the 
 pitchy darkness, when he felt something brush, with a 
 rustling sound, rapidly by him, — he started, and con- 
 ceived, he saw the shadowy outline of a human figure, 
 flitting between him and the open postern, the vision had 
 already disappeared in the obscurity of the chamber, 
 before the brigand recovered from his amazement. 
 
 " So, my lord," he exclaimed, *' you are true to your 
 appointment." No answer was returned. — " Speak, I 
 conjure thee, my Lord Balassi. Is not thine, that form 
 I see." The echo of his voice made the only reply; — 
 " if not, who art thou?" continued the count. " Answer 
 me, or take the consequence." Ragotzy loosened his 
 Hebrew vestments, and drew his sword. " Now mind me, 
 whatever thou art called, only hold this unseemly silence 
 another second, and I make you mute for ever." The 
 threat failed to elicit a response, and the brigand rushed 
 fiercely upon the figure, that seemed to stand out to his 
 orb of sight, in the extremity of the room. The bright 
 steel flashed before his eyes, as he raised it to cleave, 
 what he believed to be the person of a human being: he 
 caught no sound of motion, but the appearance seemed 
 to glide away, as Ragotzy struck at it, with such eflfect, 
 that, lighting on the rough stone-work of the apartment, 
 the blade of his weapon was shivered to pieces. The un- 
 expected shock made the brigand recoil several steps, 
 while the faint outline traced on the wall, melted into

 the rude masonry, which, on looking more attentively, he 
 became more capable of distinguishing, by means of a 
 broken lattice on the adjacent side of the chamber. 
 The low structure, which he now tenanted, had been 
 erected many years since, by the Cygani leader, that he 
 might hold unreserved communication with the magnats 
 and chiefs, who sought his services, and required the aid 
 of his daring band, to bring to issue any of those death- 
 feuds, which were of such common occurrence, at the 
 period of our story. The hovel had been inhabited only for 
 a few days, on some rare occasion; and, as a conse- 
 quence, had gradually fallen to decay. Indeed, consi- 
 dering the sequestered situation of the rude hut, it is pro- 
 bable, that few, excepting Ragotzy, and certain of his 
 followers, were aware of its existence. The brigand 
 knew not what to conclude. It might certainly have 
 been merely a shade, which he had so incautiously 
 aimed at; but, that sufficed to prove, that the ruinous 
 precints contained within their boundary, some indivi- 
 dual besides himself. That he had not tilted with his 
 own shadow, was evident, from the fact of his not havino- 
 crossed the space, where the faint light of dewy midnight 
 fell ghastfully through the interstice, upon the grey stone 
 wall, — but then, some opaque body or other, must have 
 obscured the feeble cold gleam, if he would not ascribe 
 the appearance, he was certain he had witnessed, to a 
 supernatural cause. Count Ragotzy, as we have had 
 occasion to remark, was possessed of as daring and de- 
 termined a temper as any gentleman in his line, from 
 Nimrod down to Rob Roy ; but his courage was supported 
 by a wary discretion, which saved it from degenerating 
 into rashness. How the reader would have acted in 
 his case, we will not presume to say; for ourselves, 
 we might have done as Henry Pelham, in the Rue 
 St. Honore, and screamed out for help.* Count Ra-

 gotzy walked forth into the air. There the moon light 
 softly slept on the quiet ground, crossed by the shadowy 
 erection, he had just quitted. At that instant, the graf 
 Maylat, arrived at the place of rendezvous. 
 
 *' Is, my lord, your friend sick?" demanded Ragotzy, 
 afcer the first greetings were interchanged; '' that I see 
 you alone?" 
 
 "At heart, I fear me, before this time," replied Maylat, 
 in the cadence best suited to alarming tidings. He was 
 proceeding to recount that adventure of the evening, 
 which it was our task in the last manuscript to record ; 
 v/hen his fearful associate interposed, by a gentle pressure 
 on the arm. Maylat turned his eye upward, to read in the 
 brigand's visage, the meaning of his interruption; and 
 then Ragotzy, dropping his voice to a whisper, acquaint- 
 ed him, with his suspicion of some eaves-dropper, being 
 even then within the hut. 
 
 " That we will soon ascertain," replied Maylat, speak- 
 ing also beneath his breath; " and now applaud my 
 forethought," and the young graf drew forth a small 
 lamp from under his cloak; "I bethink me of certain 
 flints ready at hand, near your tenement, with which to 
 strike a light, when, always barring the devil and Father 
 Dominick, we two need not much care, what manner of 
 folk they may be, whom we will eject from their snug 
 location." In saying these words. Count Maylat moved 
 a few steps along the line of the building, and quickly 
 illumined the lamp he had provided. Both then passed 
 into the ruinous demense, and looked cautiously around 
 tliem. It contained a single room, whose dimensions 
 accorded with the design of the erection, to occasionally 
 accommodate, or rather contain, a number of inmates. 
 The apartment possessed an immense chimney-place, 
 still glowing with the warmth of dying embers, near 
 which there was extended a rude bench, and a heap of 
 dried krumholz. The light, shed, by the lamp of Maylat,

 gave to view nought human, save his own martial figure, 
 and that of his confederate, clad in the Israelitish garb. 
 
 " Your fancy must have bodied out that form, you 
 spake of, and have played false with the materials of 
 judgment," observed Maylat. 
 
 '' It may be so," said Ragotzy, with a due affectation 
 of indifference. Since, however, internally convinced 
 that his imagination had no hand in the apparition, he had 
 beheld, he yet felt it was not his part to moot a discus- 
 sion on such a point. " It may be so; but what has 
 become of my Lord Balassi?" 
 
 Maylat recounted the circumstances, which led to his 
 detention. 
 
 "This is ill-timed," said Ragotzy, when the other had 
 concluded; "we must not think of trusting to any aid, 
 from the graf's men-at-arms ; his followers will be looked 
 to, and yourself, I fear, will be suspected, — but where's 
 this missive you mentioned?" The paper of Dr. Stan- 
 cari was produced, and speedily burst open. 
 
 " Damnation !" cried Ragotzy, the instant his eagle 
 eye took in the purport of the writing: " 'Tis from 
 Quendi-Ferens! Martinuzzi has stolen a march on us." 
 
 " Yes, dolt! I might have guessed it. If the Turkish 
 army, headed by Achamates, be not planted in the rear 
 of Piadena! Half the Hungarian force has crossed the 
 Samos!- Before dawn, the drowsy Austrians will be cut 
 off; so, good-bye to his excellency, Baptista Castaldo. 
 And for you and I, my lord, we may close the map as 
 soon as we will, and to vesper brod,* an' any digestion 
 be left us to sup withal. — There, read, read." 
 
 The epistle of Quendi Ferens briefly stated, that in en- 
 deavouring to lead his division across the dignes des 
 etangs, beyond Coloswar, he had been entangled among 
 the water-courses of the valley, where every step only

 plunged him into new difficulties ; — he had been obliged 
 to order his cavalry to dismount and lead their horses 
 back, amid plashes of mire and water, where, often, there 
 was scarcely a foothold. He had, at length, however, 
 nearly unravelled the mazes of the strath, but owing to 
 what had happened, did not expect to bring his troops 
 into action, so early, by some hours, as had been con- 
 certed. In conclusion, he mentioned, that he had that 
 instant transmitted a courier to the Ottoman camp, to 
 apprise Achamates of his having crossed the Samos. 
 
 " 'Tis most extraordinary, the Castellans were not ap- 
 prised of the position of Achamates, and of this movement 
 of Quendi Ferens, when you left Coloswar," said Maylat, 
 after glancing his eye over the paper. 
 
 *' The regent has not hitherto opened a free communi- 
 cation with the city," answered Ragotzy; "or he may 
 suspect the faith of Mirce, — there's no knowing. A 
 sortie was to be made by Raoul, at a signal agreed upon; 
 but Mirce did not anticipate its occurring before mid- 
 day to-morrow." 
 
 " Surely," said Maylat, " there never was a surprise 
 more complete than this. Piadena will be annihilated, 
 and Mirce's fine project of holding out the city of Colos- 
 war, against the Castellan Raoul, on his return, must be 
 abandoned, since it would be madness in him to defy the 
 arms of Martinuzzi, just flushed with victory. Moreover, 
 your making the regent prisoner, must be deferred ; 
 for the slightest movement to that end, would bring the 
 whole Turkish army down upon us. This man becalms 
 the land; his golden feathers stretch like sails above us, 
 and when we stir, we flag." He paused, and after a 
 minute's thought, subjoined; "Suppose, after all, we 
 trust the Marquis of Piadena ?" 
 
 "We might, perhaps, rescue him from the jaws of 
 destruction," returned Ragotzy, coldly ; " but I cannot 
 see, wherein we shall be benefited." 
 
 " Nay, my noble leader," said Maylat, " when the

 gary, is as great as their will, to support the Lady Cze- 
 rina, on her throne, we may, probably, be able to dictate 
 our own terms to the Italian; — more especially in the 
 strait, to which he will find himself reduced." 
 
 *' The Lady Czerina \" muttered the Cygani scornfully, 
 between his teeth ; and then, in a more audible voice, 
 he proceeded ; " What magnates mean you ? Do you 
 style me such ?" — and haughty was the smile of the ban- 
 dit. " Your powers will, probably, be held in check. 
 The Count Balassi is already, according to your account, 
 a prisoner, or w^orse. What magnates mean you V 
 
 "■ Nine-tenths of the independent barons of the realm," 
 replied Maylat, with animation. " Only hold out to them 
 a vista of hope, of foiling the usurper, in his ambition, 
 and, by the rood of St. Stephen ! the deeply sworn pur- 
 pose, which lies at the core of every patriot, who still 
 owns the throb of life, will be avowed, in the face of 
 Hungary. The will of Martinuzzi is submitted to, be- 
 cause, as men are led to think, there remains no other 
 chance of averting, from the country, the horrors of a 
 foreign yoke. Let us then point out, to their mental 
 vision, the day-spring from on high, by making common 
 league with Piadena, on condition of his aiding our loyal 
 emprize. His preservation must be made contingent, 
 to his promising his offices, at the coronation of the Lady 
 Czerina, immediately after the capture, or death, of her 
 tyrannical guardian. 
 
 Count Ragotzy did not, at first, reply. He revolved 
 over in his mind, for a minute or two, the various chances, 
 complicated in the line of policy, recommended by May- 
 lat. He felt convinced, that if the Seraskier* chose to 
 act, an event, however, (although he did not care to state 
 as much) of which he entertained some doubt, all warn- 
 ing to Piadena, must arrive too late ; and that nothing,

 but an express miracle, in that general's favour, could 
 save his army from the most complete discomfiture. In 
 such a case, the disaffected nobles, by their treasonable 
 '^ complicity," with a foreign and vanquished enemy, 
 would only have sealed their own condemnation, whether 
 at the hands of Martinuzzi, or Achamates, without ad- 
 vancing a single step, the cause of the injured lady, in 
 defence of whose rights, they sacrificed themselves. 
 Ragotzy had his private grounds for believing, that the 
 worst disservice, that could happen to the Lady Czerina, 
 would be the success of that very measure, her zealous 
 champions were conspiring; namely, the removal of the 
 cardinal, her guardian, from the helm of government. 
 He saw, moreover, that the amission of the directing 
 mind of Martinuzzi, at that particular crisis, must plunge 
 all things into such a state of confusion, as would not 
 fail to afford an opening to the ambition of Achamates: 
 and that, after the defeat of Piadena, the absence of the 
 regent would seem to incline the long nicely-balanced 
 scale, in favour of the Ottoman domination. 
 
 Such was the ruinous condition of affairs, which 
 Maylat's proposition, if reduced to action, appeared 
 likely to produce. The putting of Austria, as it were, 
 hors de combat ; — the utter destruction of the con- 
 spiring- magnates themselves, at the hands of the 
 Turk, and, thereby, a fatal blow struck at the corpo- 
 rate power, and privileges, of the native aristocracy ; — 
 the ascendancy of Turkish influence, in the councils of 
 the country, or, more probably, the incorporation of 
 Transylvania, with the vast empire of Solyman. On the 
 other hand, Ragotzy reflected, that the important vic- 
 tory, he appeared on the eve of obtaining, would fix Mar- 
 tinuzzi more firmly than ever on his seat, and that the 
 chapter of accidents, might not, speedily, present such 
 another opportunity of securing his person. The Cygani 
 leader perceived plainly, that the affair must implicate 
 the lives of Maylat and the confederated chiefs, without

 a particle of commensurate advantage, accruing to the 
 Lady Czerina. 
 
 " But what matters that to me ?" argued the wily ad- 
 venturer, with himself: "their bane must prove my mith- 
 ridate. The weakness of Czerina, the failure of her 
 partizans, constitute my strength. My interest, like 
 that of the Corinthian of old, is to have these taller ears 
 struck down.* The personal freedom, and absolute will 
 of Martinuzzi, are insuperable impediments to the Lady 
 Veronica, — my wife, that shall be, obtaining her rightful 
 inheritance. A dungeon may bring the arrogant prelate, 
 to reason, — and he may capitulate to my terms ; or 1 
 may succeed, in coming to some agreement with Soly- 
 man. Veronica's claims, merely require an impartial 
 hearing, for which the removal of Martinuzzi makes way. 
 But, at the worst, I shall have only caged the lion, not 
 speared him ; and, at any time, I can strike up a sort of 
 compromise with the regent, and let him loose upon the 
 country, when his very roar will disperse all foreign 
 enemies, and privy conspirators, and set the land to 
 rights again." 
 
 The above train of thought, has required of us not a 
 few lines to elucidate ; but, in a much shorter space 
 of time, than the reader will have consumed in their pe- 
 rusal, the mind of Ragotzy leaped, as it were, the argu- 
 mental .process, and determined in what mode, he had 
 best adapt his policy to circumstances. 
 
 " Why, methinks, upon reflection, my lord," said the 
 brigand, resuming the discourse, " that there appears 
 some likelihood, in what thou proposest ; and, I am free 
 to confess, I do not see, as matters stand, any otiier

 game that is left us to play. I only discover one little 
 difficulty, which, pressed as we are for time, I take to be 
 somewhat formidable." 
 
 " I see none whatever," said Maylat ; " point out that, 
 which seems such to thy microscopic vision." 
 
 " Why nothing less," answered Ragotzy, " than how 
 Piadena is to be gently wakened, by our communication, 
 instead of being aroused, by the rude clamour of Quendi 
 Ferens." 
 
 *' Wont you undertake the commission ?" asked Maylat, 
 somewhat brusquely. 
 
 " Not quite so fast, my good lord," replied Ragotzy : 
 '* I shall have enough to do, to get my little band into 
 battle-array, betimes. The lads are wont to repose 
 soundly, whenever sleep is allowable, and I scarcely an- 
 ticipated, having any such desperate work to put them 
 to, before to-morrow eve, at the earliest. They will be 
 hard to waken." 
 
 " So hard, that no earthly power can accomplish 
 it,'" exclaimed some person, apparently close beside the 
 brigand. 
 
 Ragotzy laid his hand upon a sort of short carabine, 
 which was the only weapon of offence, which remained 
 to him, and directed his eyes around, but beheld no- 
 body. Count Maylat, meantime, raised the lamp from 
 the bench, and introduced its doubtful light, into the 
 far gloom of the chamber. There was, evidently, no 
 other person in the room, and yet they agreed the voice 
 sounded contiguous. Suddenly, a thought seemed to 
 strike the Cygani leader, who, sallying out of the hut, 
 made directly towards that broken gap in the wall, which, 
 though dilapitated, by the wear and tear of the elements, 
 had been, probably, designedly left, as an interstice for 
 a window. 
 
 On turning an angle of the building, Ragotzy descried 
 a human figure, about the distance of a bow-shot off, 
 retreating precipitately, towards the dark covert of the

 wood. Internally persuaded, that it must have been the 
 shadow of that flying form, which, previous to Maylat's 
 arrival, had occasioned him some inquietude , besides hav- 
 ing been the cause of shivering his good sword to pieces, 
 and entertaining, likewise, a well-grounded suspicion, 
 that his interview, with the graf, had been witnessed, by 
 the same prying individual, his immediate impulse was to 
 level his carabine, at the fugitive ; but a moment's con- 
 sideration, suggesting the possibility of missing his aim, 
 he determined to reserve his fire, till he had either over- 
 taken him, or, at least, so diminished the distance, as to 
 be tolerably sure of bringing him down. 
 
 As well as the shifting beams of the moon, that now 
 shimmered, with a faint light, over the sylvan scene, 
 enabled him to distinguish, the person, in whose wake he 
 followed, with such haste, was dressed in the ordinary 
 garb, and armed with the ordinary implements of the 
 herdsman of the forest ; but it became a matter of no 
 small marvel to Ragotzy, after a chase of several minutes, 
 along the winding path which skirted the wood, that he 
 did not appear, sensibly, to gain ground, on the object 
 of his pursuit. While he was yet, with unabated vigour,, 
 following up his game, or, more correctly speaking, 
 straining every nerve, to exceed the rate at which the 
 herdsman ran, he was suddenly struck, with surprise, by 
 the outline of the figure, on which he kept his eye, be- 
 coming confounded amid a dark, living mass, composed 
 of men-at-arms, into whose hands, an abrupt turning of 
 the narrow wood-path, along which he directed his flight, 
 appeared to have delivered him a prisoner. Ragotzy 
 instantly slackened his pace, and partly guessing how 
 matters stood, lost no time in ensconcing himself, in the 
 rear of certain huge trunks of trees, the group of which, 
 constituted a sort of advanced post of the interminable 
 forest. In a minute, the whole body came up, at a rapid 
 pace, and he heard their heavy tramp, within a few yards 
 of the spot where he lurked. Notwithstanding his cri-

 tical situation, he could not resist casting one look on 
 the martial array, and, noiselessly shifting his position, 
 he glanced his eye over the small corps, as they defiled, 
 only two a-breast, before his sight. They wore the co- 
 lours of Hungary ; and, therefore, acknowledged the 
 authority of the regent. More than half the troop had, 
 already, passed forward ; but, at the command of a tall 
 cavalier, who spake as one having authority, some half- 
 dozen made a halt, at that instant, close to Ragotzy. 
 This person was girt in a suit of black armour, of the 
 simplest form, and his vizor was down. 
 
 '' It was even here, or I much mistake," said he, " that 
 our eye lost sight of him, whose pursuit hurried yon 
 cattle-keeper, so blindly on our trail. Bring forward 
 the prisoner." 
 
 The features of the speaker were, of course, hidden 
 behind the vizor ; but the voice was one, with which 
 Ragotzy had been too long familiar, not immediately to 
 recognise. 
 
 " Doubly-damned traitor !" he muttered between his 
 clenched teeth ; " So thou wouldst buy the pardon of 
 thy past life, by conducting the myrmidons of the regent, 
 to the haunts of thy sworn commander ? It is well ; — it 
 is excellent; — thou wouldst betray the Bandit Polgar, 
 wouldst thou ? but he will at once wipe out old scores, 
 and, in this very hour, which consummates thy trea- 
 chery, thou shalt be made the victim of his retri- 
 bution." 
 
 Saying, or rather thinking thus, Ragotzy grasped his 
 piece more firmly, and levelled it at the vizored cavalier. 
 He held back for a moment, however, for, in the cattle- 
 keeper, who was now brought forward, guarded between 
 two armed men, he was perfectly perplexed to discover 
 the wild young noble, who had ferried him over the 
 Samos. 
 
 Meantime, the commander spoke. " I would ask 
 again, what cause, young man, induced you to fly with

 such precipitation, and say, was it not hereabouts, your 
 comrade, or foeman, whichever he was, made off into the 
 wood ?" 
 
 " I repeat/' said Sigismund, '' my demand, as you 
 would answer for your conduct to the regent, to be, as 
 speedily as possible, brought to ear of his eminence. I 
 have intelligence, of no common moment, which, to be 
 worth hearing, must be told instantly. In respect to 
 the ruffian, from whom I fled," — he paused, and turned 
 his head quickly on one side, adding, — '^ why, I have 
 him now in my eye, — he lurks behind the trunk of the 
 very tree, beneath whose branches we stand." 
 
 " Indeed !" said the commander ; ''some of you rout 
 him out, and bring him before me ; and, regarding your 
 wish, young man, to be conveyed before the regent, 
 you shall obtain it, when I have executed my present 
 duty." 
 
 Sigismund betrayed no slight degree of impatience. 
 '* I tell you, sir knight," he remonstrated, " the regent 
 will give you small thanks for not instantly heeding my 
 request. Those, whom you are in search of, are beyond 
 your reach. There were two of them, the one, evi- 
 dently, by your men not having, ere this, brought him 
 before you, has effected his escape ; the other will hardly 
 wait your coming. I pledge you my honour, the regent 
 would be more obliged to you for my tidings, than for 
 the caption of Count Maylat." 
 
 The expostulation of Sigismund answered no purpose. 
 '' The honour of a Kanactz .'" said the cavalier, in a con- 
 temptuous tone ; " but you named the right traitor, sure 
 enough ; and, since you are so strangely pertinacious, 
 and that he, whom you say you beheld, seems not likely 
 to be speedily forthcoming, I will so far oblige you, as 
 to delay here no longer." And, agreeably to this reso- 
 lution, which Sigismund heard with deep inquietude, 
 though patience appeared his only resource, the troop 
 resumed their march towards the hut, and, by taking the

 circuitous route, which swept along the line of the wood, 
 they, at length, arrived at that desolate goal. 
 
 Return we to Count Ragotzy. Surprised by the 
 sudden command, issued for his seizure, he was diverted 
 for the time, from his object of assassination, and, for the 
 assurance of his own freedom, betook himself to flight. 
 The line he followed, ran coiling among the trees, so 
 that, although at the first start, he was but a little 
 a-head, his knowledge of the intricacies of the wood 
 speedily enabled him to leave his pursuers, at fault, and 
 many minutes had not elapsed, ere the Cygani leader, 
 breathless indeed, but free and unfettered, looked forth, 
 from under the same broad-stemmed oak, behind whose 
 trunk he lurked, when first Sigismund detected his prox- 
 imity. By the cold, clear light of the moon, he could 
 behold the foremost rank of the little division, falling into 
 line in front of the hut, which they had just reached. 
 A thousand desperate passions raged in the breast of 
 Ragotzy. The conviction thus pressed upon him, that 
 Martinuzzi did indeed set his malice at defiance, or he 
 would never employ, in the face of the world, a man, 
 whom the brigand considered a creature of his own, to 
 betray him into the toils of justice, by indicating his most 
 secret haunt, though it stung his brain, even like mad- 
 ness, was not the agony that was most objective (if the 
 epithet can be allowed) in the mind of Ragotzy. No ; 
 trusting, ere the moon again clomb the heavens, to be 
 quits with his mighty enemy, he endeavoured to bid the 
 thought of Martinuzzi's open hostility pass away for the 
 present, or would have transferred it to the sum of bitter 
 feelings, which rankled, in his malignant nature, at the 
 consciousness of his revenge having been baflfled. 
 Burning, with a sort of fiendish lust after vengeance, 
 his eyes still remained fixed on the movements of the 
 small party of military, and he could faintly distinguish 
 the form of the mailed cavalier, conspicuous amongst 
 the rest from his dark plume and glancing helmet, who

 appeared to have fallen back to the rear, where the dis- 
 guised young count was stationed, between two men- 
 at-arms. 
 
 There are a sort of men, whom circumstances, or their 
 own genius, have spoiled, who, whenever their self-will 
 conceives any possible kind of gratification, cannot rest, 
 till, with whatever cost, and at whatever risk, they con- 
 summate their wishes. Count Ragotzy was one of these 
 slaves to the slightest promptings of that evil principle, 
 which, however human nature came by it, was assuredly 
 never meant to be humoured and pampered, till, like the 
 rod of Aaron, it swallow up every kind of antagonist 
 motive, in its insane violence. 
 
 The sight of the commander of the party, moving to 
 the completion of his treachery, renewed, in Ragotzy's 
 breast, the deep desire for retribution, which he was so 
 near gratifying. He gazed and gazed, till, in the hot 
 inspiration of wicked passion, the spirit of the devil 
 moved upon his blood, and he conceived the course of 
 action, which he determined forthwith to pursue. The 
 low structure, where Ragotzy's eyes now involuntarily 
 rested, was situated not many paces, from the furthermost 
 edge of that vast marshy pool, of which we before spake. 
 The dark wall of forest, which circumscribed the na- 
 tural and capacious dingle, stretched itself to a distance 
 of several hundred yards on every side, from the stag- 
 nant waters, with the exception of that group of oak- 
 wood, beneath which Ragotzy was planted, at which 
 point, the forest made a sweep in the direction of the 
 morass, and the waters of the latter stretched forth a 
 deep, narrow arm, into the midst of the grove, as if to 
 return the courtesy. 
 
 " Within that melancholy grove 
 The tardy deep and sullen current rolls 
 Unwillingly : Thou might'st have sat upon 
 Its banks, and seen its glassy face made black. 
 By tall pines, which lean over it and talk. 
 And trees that weep into its stream \ no secret

 Beneath that solitary water's Avave 
 Can the bright eye discern ; — the lights in Heaven 
 See not what's done under the strict embrace 
 Of those protecting boughs." * 
 
 Ragotzy's determination was, if possible, to regain the 
 like favourable opportunity for snatching at revenge, 
 which accident had momentarily afforded, but which he 
 had weakly neglected turning to account. For that 
 purpose, he would have awaited his victim where he then 
 was, only he remembered, there was a more direct path 
 leading from the hut to the regent's camp, which, it was 
 not improbable, the party would pursue on their return. 
 To reach the building, by the course the little detach- 
 ment had followed, it would be necessary to make a 
 long circuit, which would, probably, lead to the dis- 
 covery of his approach, and, of course, defeat his best 
 chance of succeeding in his sanguinary design. The 
 third mode, which presented itself to his fertile brain, 
 was to proceed, in a line proper to an arrow or a hunts- 
 man, and which might remind the punning reader of the 
 petticoats of a Parisian grisette, being, in fact, the 
 shortest cut possible. This implied the necessity of 
 crossing the deep morass, which, while it led him di- 
 rectly to his purpose, Ragotzy hoped would favour his 
 stealing unobserved, within gunshot of the hated cavalier. 
 With this intent, he descended into the water, keeping 
 as near as possible to the edge, where the tranquil pool 
 was overgrown with long, rank grasses, that, in a great 
 measure, concealed his form as he crept along. As the 
 water varied abruptly in depth, sometimes scarce reach- 
 ing unto his knees, and then again suddenly covering his 
 shoulders, the chief difficulty which presented itself to 
 Ragotzy, in wading through the swamp, was the having 
 constantly to hold his fire-arms above the level of the 
 waters, under shelter of the sedge and rushes.

 Having, at length, ensconced himself in the capacious 
 hollow of that broad-breasted tree, we formerly described, 
 he next applied his orb of vision to a slight fissure in 
 the bark, to ascertain the state of things in the vi- 
 cinity of the hovel. He immediately gathered, from 
 the confusion and bustle about the threshold, that some 
 interesting matter (though he could not discover what) 
 was transacting within. *' Surely," thought Ragotzy, 
 "Count Maylat can scarce have been so infatuated, as to 
 await the coming of his captors." 
 
 The next instant a scream rent the air, the men-at-arms 
 drew back on either side the portal, and the commander 
 issued forth, carrying in his arms, the lifeless form of a 
 young female. '^ Stand off, every one of ye !" he ex- 
 claimed, in a loud, agitated tone of voice, ^' nor follow 
 me." Almost at the word, having, with rapid strides, 
 cleared the space of ground between the hut and the 
 dark pool, he halted, within a spear's length of the wither- 
 ed oak ; then, half kneeling on the brink of the water, 
 he supported the pale inanimate on his knee and arm, 
 whilst he splashed her neck and brow with the vivificative 
 liquid, that he scooped up in his open palm. The two 
 figures were thus disposed, beneath the serene and star-lit 
 heavens, that broadened round them, and were defined 
 to Ragotzy's eye, with a vivid but ghostly effect, in the 
 solemnizing light of the hour. 
 
 A second time was the brigand, on the eve of sacrificing 
 the vizored knight to his vengeance, but even as he low- 
 ered the muzzle of his carabine, his coasternation, (for 
 the state of his mind can be adequately expressed by no 
 weaker term,) so overcame him, as to paralyze for a mo- 
 ment his power of action ; but his purpose was only 
 suspended, not abandoned. That exquisite form, set off 
 by the dark robe, that fitted so accurately to the contour 
 of its " winding lineaments," — that marbly countenance, 
 which no Parian stone, however it might emulate its 
 whiteness, was ever taught to rival, in the immaterial and

 diviner quality of expression — those long tresses of mol-. 
 ten gold, which went streaming over her shoulders, and 
 which " might seem to a fanciful view" to be busied 
 embarrassing the stray beams from above, in their abun- 
 dant tangles — if the encountering these well-known 
 points of feminine loveliness, suddenly presented to his 
 view, startled the brigand for an instant, it was owing to 
 the extremity of his surprise, at falling in with their in- 
 sensible possessor, at liberty, and under such peculiar 
 circumstances, at the very time, he had reason to believe 
 her personal freedom to be under circumscription, nearly 
 a league from the spot. 
 
 Ragotzy shortly recovered his self-command, and 
 fearing any longer to procrastinate, and urged to the 
 diabolical deed, from motives, to which a concurrence 
 of circumstances had just lent a frightful access of force, 
 he took a leisurely and deliberate aim, at the object of his 
 wrath, and fired. The mailed knight staggered, and was 
 sinking, wounded to the earth, when the assassin, who 
 had darted forwards, snatched from his relaxed hold the 
 light form of the half-conscious being, he had hitherto 
 borne on his arm, and with a voice, whose dreadful ac- 
 cents sounded on the strings of the other's very heart, 
 piercing the wretched man with keener agony, than did 
 the bullet in his side, muttered — '^ Remember the bridga 
 of the Vienne /" 
 
 Vicchy, for it was even he, would have spoken — he 
 would have struggled, — to no purpose ; the next instant, 
 even ere several of the men-at-arms had rushed to his 
 assistance. Count Ragotzy was seen with his lovely prize, 
 darting along in the direction of the wood, with the des- 
 perate speed of one of its native denizens, when he hies to 
 his hidden retreat, holding the evidence of his ravages in 
 his fangs. The wounded man, as he pointed to the re- 
 ceding form of the human tiger, sunk, with a deep moan, 
 senseless on the earth. Count Ragotzy, meanwhile, 
 moved swiftly in a straight line, towards the trackless cover

 of the forest, trusting-, if he could only gain its dark 
 shade, to set his pursuers at defiance. Till he ar- 
 rived on the very verge of the lofty line of ash, beech, 
 hazel, and other forest trees, which skirted the dingle, he 
 refrained from looking behind him ; there, however, he 
 paused, and ascertained, with his own eyes, that out of 
 nearly a score of men, who had originally instituted a 
 pursuit, not above half a dozen had followed it up. Of 
 these, however, three were directly at his heels. With a 
 fresh impulse, he resumed his flight at full speed, bearing 
 his lovely burden under his left arm, as if he felt not her 
 weight. As he attained the narrow opening into a depth 
 of thicket, impervious to the rays of moon and stars, one 
 of his hunters pressed so close on him, that he heard his 
 loud panting in his very ear, and even almost fancied he 
 could feel his gasping breath, warm on his bare neck. 
 Not willing to incur the risk of any one discovering the 
 path, he meant to follow, he warily suffered the man to 
 approach as near, as within arm's length, when, abruptly 
 stopping short, he swung his carabine round with such 
 force, as he wheeled suddenly about, that the butt-end, 
 lighting on his pursuer's head, struck him to the earth. 
 Again Ragotzy pushed forward, and shoving aside the 
 branches of the exuberant shoots, which nearly covered 
 the soil, he soon rested beneath the shade of implicated 
 leaves, in all the confidence of security. Gently unclasp- 
 ing his arm from about his beauteous spoil, he placed her 
 beside him, upon a seat opportunely afforded, by the felled 
 arm of some centuried Titan of the forest. In the mean- 
 time, the lovely girl was fast recovering her animation, 
 and consciousness, and her returning sensation was first 
 indicated by convulsive sobs. Happening to feebly raise 
 her head, from the broad breast on which it leant, her 
 eyes fell on tlie person of her supporter. For a moment, 
 she did not recollect him, but the next instant, a short 
 cry of alarm broke from her lips. Her very flesh seemed 
 to her creeping with horror, and it was with difficulty,

 she avoided again going off into a swoon, at thus finding 
 herself, in such close proximity to the detested brigand. 
 
 " Was it all deception ?" she exclaimed, half audibly, 
 starting from the blood-curdling contact. " Great God ! 
 I deluded myself, that I had found my father, and lo ! I 
 look around me, and even thou, from whose strong hold 
 I had flattered myself, I had escaped for ever, sittest, in 
 horrible reality, by my side ! It can't be true — I dream, 
 sure. I'll hide me in the recesses of the wood, till I 
 awake." 
 
 Saying these words, the fair speaker rose, and made 
 an effort to escape ; but Count Ragotzy, as she turned 
 away, laid his hand firmly on her wrist, and with gentle 
 violence induced her to be re-seated. 
 
 " Dearest Lady Veronica," he said, " agitate not thy- 
 self to thine own mind's injury ; there can no harm 
 reach thee, when he is present, who, within these four- 
 and-twenty hours, purposeth to secure a legal claim to 
 thy possession, beyond the reach of fate itself to annul, 
 by making thee his own, his wedded bride — his coun- 
 tess." 
 
 Veronica breathed short and quick. " Thy wedded 
 bride, murderer !" she answered indignantly ; " rather 
 the bride of death !" With these words, she closed her 
 eyes, and turned aside. 
 
 " Nay, my Veronica, thou wert too rare a tribute to 
 offer up at the dark shrine of the skeleton divinity; but 
 I love thy spirit, and will mate with thee, after the only 
 mode one of thy proud temper should be wived;" and 
 he bent his sinister glances on her shrinking countenance, 
 till her eyes sunk with shame, beneath their shocking 
 expression. "Thou art a lioness," continued the bri- 
 gand, " by right and attribute ; and, by my sword ! I'll 
 woo thee, lady, as the king of the forest prevails in his 
 tender suit." 
 
 " Thou presume to compare thyself to that royal beast, 
 who hast not a solitary noble quality in thy nature! —

 thou ! with whom the very earth groans in abhorrence !" 
 answered Veronica, in an ungovernable burst of indigna- 
 tion. " Why hast thou stolen me from my peaceful 
 home ? Why held me in captivity ? And why, having 
 effected my escape, under the auspices of the bravest of 
 men, darest thou again commit this wanton outrage on 
 my liberty ? Why dost thou detain me now ?" 
 
 *' Wilt thou deign, Lady Veronica, to explain," said 
 Ragotzyj in that low, serious tone, which bespoke him 
 deeply solicitous respecting the nature of the response ; 
 at the same time casting an oblique glance of mingled 
 ferocity and admiration upon the damsel, " whom thou 
 art pleased to honour, by the style of the bravest of men ?" 
 
 A slight tinge of added colour flitted across the cheek 
 of the undaunted girl, as she replied, " One whom thou 
 wilt know, to thy cost, sooner than thou deemest ; and 
 one, who hath for years vowed to Heaven to rid earth of 
 a monster." 
 
 Ragotzy bit his lip, to suppress his irritated feelings, 
 as he made answer — " Since his interest or fears have 
 kept him so long forsworn, it is to be hoped your cham^- 
 pion, like a perjured braggart, will yet kiss the vile clay 
 from which his spirit sprang ; at least, my best endea^ 
 vours shall not be wanting to that end ; for, understand. 
 Lady Veronica, I shall institute the strictest scrutiny, as 
 to the manner of your strange elopement." 
 
 Veronica smiled scornfully, but returned no answer. 
 
 There followed a long deep pause, broken by the 
 clanging toll of the abbey bell of Coloswar, which 
 swung far over the moon-lit woodland, and, dying faintly 
 away into a kind of booming echo, vibrated, sweet and 
 melancholy, for several seconds, in the vault of distance. 
 
 Then Ragotzy arose, and spoke : — " Lady," he said, 
 " I would gladly allow you further rest, did circum- 
 stances admit of it ; but never, since the hour when St. 
 Stephen annexed Transylvania to the crown of Hungary,*

 was any ido* more pregnant v,^ith miglity occurrents^ 
 than the moment of time, on which we hover. Even now, 
 the sensible wind doth catch the signal, and, like a sud- 
 den wave, heaves onward at each slow alarum ; and the 
 music of day is pealing in the east : but, lady, ere light 
 and life are quickened anew, many a tongue, that now 
 wags freely, will be laid low, and, if I err not, the allegi- 
 ance of this kingdom will be bound, hand and foot, to 
 thy lover's chariot wheel, to be by him handed over, 
 where alone it is due, to the lovely grandchild of Baron 
 Walstein." 
 
 Veronica was painfully astonished, and visibly turned 
 pale. The Cygani's equivocal prophecy in her childhood, 
 coupled with the strange fact of her father having, ever 
 since indulged, in what she was wont to consider vision- 
 ary anticipations of its fulfilment, crossed her mind. The 
 full coherence of its opposite significations struck her. 
 Turning her head aside, she covered her eyes with her 
 hand. *' Good God !" she communed with herself, " is 
 it possible, the augury, which promised so splendidly, 
 should have such a fatal meaning, and yet prove true?" 
 
 The abstracted damsel had no time to dwell longer on 
 the melancholy retrospect, and more melancholy prospect 
 of the future, for Ragotzy, by intimating with a graceful 
 reverence his desire, that they should proceed, aroused 
 her from her mood of reflection, to a painful sense of the 
 more real and pressing peril of the hour. After quaffing 
 a draught, at a clear spring, which gushed o'er the ver- 
 dant hillock near where she sat, Veronica quiescently 
 prepared to '' o'er-trip the dew," in company with the 
 brigand, rather than feel herself forcibly enveloped in his 
 hated arms, a consequent which she knew would follow her 
 slightest manifestation of reluctance, in obeying his will. 
 Silently and rapidly, therefore, the sullen pair — Count 
 Ragotzy, like a man whose thoughts were abstracted from

 the scene around him, and his fair captive, lost in melan- 
 choly reflections — traversed, for some time, the labyrin- 
 thian fastnesses of the forest, when their ears caught 
 faintly the gurgling ripple of the neighbouring river, as 
 it murmured in the stillness of the moonlight calm, and 
 spent its tiny waves, with lulling measure, o i the pebbly 
 shore. Suddenly they reached a turn in the tangled 
 path, which gave them to behold the river, glistening 
 beneath them, and shining, far as the eye could reach, 
 like a long rim of silver, athwart the verdant vale. At a 
 little distance, on the further side of the stream, the vene- 
 rable Abbey of Coloswar lay in the view ; while, in its 
 vicinage, half wrapped in mist, and half basking in the 
 mellov/ light of the starry hour, might be defined the 
 turrets of the city, washed and girdled by a branch of the 
 divided Samos. Just as they were on the point of de- 
 scending the broken, and scarce visible thoroughfare, by 
 which alone, a sort of bridge, (if three loose planks 
 which arched the water v/here the river became narrow, 
 might be termed such,) was accessible, they were startled 
 by the apparition of one, whom of all men they least 
 expected to encounter. This was no other than our 
 friend Sigismund, who, abruptly breaking his way, through 
 the leaves and branches of a neighbouring thicket, plant- 
 ed himself right in the path of the brigand, and his fair 
 captive, as if disposed to dispute their passage. The 
 colour danced glowingly on the cheek of Veronica, at 
 beholding our hero, and, with a slight ejaculation of joy, 
 she would have rushed forward to claim his protection, 
 but Ragotzy almost rudely held back the agitated girl, 
 and thrust her behind him. 
 
 " What, ho ! my agile cattle-keeper," exclaimed the 
 Cygani, tauntingly, at the same time dropping the breech 
 of his carabine to the earth, *' you have passed your 
 apprenticeship to some purpose in these woods, and can 
 thread their mazes with no small adroitness. I am not 
 the first Hebrew, by half a score, I warrant me, whom,

 young as thou art, thou hast knocked on the head with 
 thy terrible axe, my merry forester; thou knowest a trick 
 of thy craft." 
 
 " Thou speakest sooth, sir gipsy," replied Sigismund, 
 in the like tone, looking Ragotzy firmly in the eye. " I 
 know the huntsman finesse of entrapping a fox, by keep- 
 ing a look-out at his old earth, but this is no time for 
 talking. I demand that lady at your hands, when you 
 may go your ways, for the present, in peace ; at least, 
 in such peace, as your own reflections will admit of." 
 
 " Dost thou deem thou hast a real Jew to deal with, 
 sir wild-cat of the woods, that thou speakest so heroi- 
 cally ? or wouldst thou have me cudgel thy folly, which 
 somewhat exceedeth, since what time thou hast given thy 
 keeper the slip ?" 
 
 " Count Polgar," said Sigismund, or by whatever 
 other name itpleaseth thee to be distinguished, "the hour 
 of reckoning between thee and me is nearer, than thou 
 dreamest, and the balance may be heavier against thee, 
 than perchance thou wottest of; but at this moment, for 
 the sake of the fair being, whom thou hast so inhumanly 
 abducted from her friends, I confess, I would willingly 
 forego arbitrating our quarrel. Surrender the lady, 
 therefore, and again I say, thou may'st go thy ways, in 
 such peace, as is proper to thy nature." 
 
 " And were I prepared to do thy behest herein, most 
 sane of knight errants ! with what conscience canst thou 
 put forth a claim to the protection of the lady ? Thou art 
 scarcely her natural guardian, — and so equivocal a young 
 gentleman were no safe, or proper companion for her 
 modesty, in the lonely recesses of the wood. Go thy ways, 
 then, in such peace, as thy unruly malady will permit." 
 
 " I will deign exchange no further terms with thee, 
 leader of vagrants, or, what does better speak thee, 77iiir- 
 derer !" said Sigismund : — " One word to the lady Vero- 
 nica," and immediately addressing the maid, he conjured 
 her to inform him, whether it was her will to proceed with

 theCygani? assuring her of his protection, in case she 
 preferred returning to her father, whom the villain had 
 left severely wounded. 
 
 Veronica cast upon the speaker those twin stars, set in 
 azure, that rivalled the soft hue of the sky — *' Oh ! save 
 me, save me, from that homicide, by conveying me to 
 my father's arms !" she exclaimed. 
 
 A voice from Heaven, could hardly have made a 
 stronger impression upon Sigismund, than did this thril- 
 ling entreaty of the trembling girl. " Enough," he cried, 
 advancing with his axe uplifted, in threatening attitude, 
 against Count Ragotzy. 
 
 '' More than enough," returned the brigand, with an 
 oath, which we spare the reader; and even as the impre- 
 cation issued from his lips, the report of his fire-arms 
 resounded on the ear. 
 
 Sigismund, who well understood the character of the 
 man, with whom he was about to contend, had kept a 
 wary eye throughout the whole colloquy, on the least 
 movement of the Cygani, anticipating from the first, what 
 climax to his arguments, he most probably meditated. 
 Even in the instant, that the pre-eminent villain, un- 
 noticed, as he fancied by Sigismund, raised his carabine, 
 our hero caught a glimpse of the threatening action, and 
 light of foot, and quick of eye, dodged alertly aside, and 
 having thus eluded his death, rushed with stern determi- 
 nation, on his opponent. 
 
 The conflict which followed, a la single-stick, might 
 almost be called tremendous. The agility and address of 
 both appeared pretty equally matched, and whatever 
 trifling advantage of personal strength Ragotzy might, 
 perhaps, have been entitled to claim, was fully counter- 
 balanced, by the inferiority of his weapon, which was 
 scarcely so manageable, as the more effective axen in- 
 strument of Sigismund : when, however, the strokes of 
 both presently fell, with more discrimination and less 
 frequently, as either party acquired a greater degree of

 caution and respect, for the prowess of his opponent, 
 the brigand began to assert the superiority of skill and 
 practice, which his experienced arm might naturally be 
 supposed to possess, over that of so raw an adversary, as 
 Sigismund. After looking one another in the eye, for 
 nearly a minute, the latter combatant sensibly slackened 
 his exertions ; and though, whenever Ragotzy would retire, 
 with the object of recharging his carabine, he invariably 
 foiled his manoeuvre, by closing on the brigand, still 
 Sigismund evited, with no little care, having to grapple 
 with his opponent. 
 
 The " rattling of sticks" had now lasted for some time, 
 and had all the appearance of being destined to terminate 
 fatally for our hero ; but at this crisis of danger, the fur- 
 ther strife was interrupted, by an armed knight, who, 
 throwing himself between the parties, and whirling his 
 sword about him, to their imminent risk, exclaimed, in a 
 loud commanding tone — "Hold off, sir Jew! and sir 
 cattle-keeper, both ! or, by the souls of all the saints, I'll 
 give your heads an impetus towards the river, and leave 
 your trunks where they stand, for the perch of carrion." 
 
 Count Ragotzy and Sigismund, raised their eyes simul- 
 taneously, and to their common amazement, discovered, 
 that, in the ardour of their encounter, they had suffered 
 themselves to be approached, and nearly surrounded, by a 
 small body of military. 
 
 " Come, my hero of the axe, and you, sir Israelite !" 
 proceeded the intruder, after a short pause, " explain 
 your cause of quarrel. Would the Jew, after the manner 
 of his tribe, have turned false knave, in some matter of 
 base traffic between ye, and the kanactz in his heat, like 
 Sir Brennus of yore, have cast his weapon in the scale? — 
 or would the kanactz, after the manner of his disreputable 
 class, have cast his weapon at the Jew's head, for no cause 
 but his own villany ? If so, by St. Stephen ! he seems 
 to have met with his match. Speak, thou Jew, first, and 
 be not cowed, for though thou be'st no more than a mere

 Jew, old John Banffy will see justice done thee, as cer- 
 tainly, as if thou wert dear to him, as his favorite charger, 
 or his wolf-dog, corvin." 
 
 " I make no doubt of your goodness, sir knight," said 
 Ragotzy, with an affectation of humility, " and I would 
 crave your protection for myself and sister, to go forwards 
 on our pilgrimage, without let or hindrance, from that 
 son of Amalek, who would despoil me of kindred, even 
 the damsel I spoke of, and rifle that jewel which is the 
 maiden's boast, and which, if it be genuine, is of vast price, 
 not to say rarity, in these latter days ; but verily I have 
 stretched forth a strong arm in her defence, being vowed 
 to perish for her sake ; and even to that extremity may 
 the Lord deal with me, and worse also, if my words be 
 not the words of verity and truth" — and making a most 
 profound reverence, the pretended Jew awaited the reply 
 of the knight. 
 
 " If thou canst make appear what thou sayest, sir 
 Hebrew," replied BanfFy, " I'll have the rascally cattle- 
 keeper soundly flogged, within these five minutes, for an 
 example to his lawless generation. But how is thy lack 
 of evidence, in proof of thy account, to be explained? 
 Thy sister hath either only existed in thine own imagina- 
 tion, or else hath given ye the slip, holding, belike, Jew 
 and Gentile in equal esteem." 
 
 " Oh^ sir knight !" exclaimed Veronica, with a flush on 
 her cheek, and a beating heart, making her way through 
 the bushes, whither she had fled, on the approach of 
 BanfFy's troop — "That bad man is no connection of mine ! 
 it is he would bear me away with him to imprisonment, 
 and worse than death. The count, — I mean the cattle- 
 keeper, — is commissioned to conduct me to my father ; his 
 opponent hath no just authority over me, and is no Jew, sir 
 knight, but aCygani, and a captain of ahordeof brigands." 
 
 " The damsel raveth," cried Ragotzy. 
 
 " We will try that, when we have more leisure," re- 
 turned BanfFy ; and then he added, in a commanding

 tone, '' Make all three prisoners; and march, with them,, 
 forwards. By Heavens! ere this we should have crossed 
 the Samos." 
 
 Those near prepared to obey the order of the knight. 
 Veronica was easily secured, and Sigismund quietly sur- 
 rendered himself; but it did not suit Count Ragotzy to 
 have his liberty, in like manner, restricted; and as he 
 was never accustomed to yield a jot, in any case, where 
 overruling necessity did not compel him, he silently de- 
 termined to leave a memorable token, with BanfFy and his 
 troop, to remind them of having crossed the path of the 
 formidable brigand. But, first coming up somewhat 
 nearer to Sigismund, he said, in a tone, which seemed to 
 issue from the very depths of the inner man, " Young 
 madcap ! your humour, before this, would have been 
 somewhat chastened, but for the intrusion of these 
 gentry. I go, and till we meet again, choose to forget 
 thy very existence. Then, however, mark me! will be at 
 once my period for recollection, and my hour of ven- 
 geance ; for, as sure as I live to say it, so, certainly, 
 when we next encounter, shall our renewed acquaintance 
 be brief and bloody." Without awaiting the reply, which 
 was on the lip of Sigismund, the brigand eluded the two 
 armed men, who were on the point of capturing him, and 
 stood at the elbow of the old knight, the commander of 
 the party. BanfFy had, unwittingly, planted himself on 
 the brink of a ravine, or yawning cleft of the earth, 
 which was, in a great measure, covered and concealed 
 by a mass of trees and copsewood, that, partly taught 
 by nature, and partly, probably, instructed by art, clus- 
 tered over the opening. 
 
 " I tell you what, my old cock," said the Cygani lea- 
 der, in the ear of the astounded chieftain, ^' you threat- 
 ened, awhile ago, to set my head rolling tow^ards the 
 river. One good turn demands another ; but as I have 
 no means of decapitation at hand, your whole body 
 must fain accompany your head in its downward course."

 Saying these words, Count Ragotzy, taking the ancient 
 knight at unawares, compressed his powerful arms around 
 his waist, lifting him fairly from the earth. As if gifted 
 with the physical powers of that athlete, that Pausanias 
 speaks of,* the brigand clipped his captive with an iron 
 embrace, that, from his being wholly unprepared for 
 such an assault, baffled all resistance. Then, making a 
 sudden plunge, which carried him and his burden into 
 the very heart of the thicket, he threw himself adown the 
 precipitous descent, with free but careful footsteps. In 
 an instant, captor and captured, were lost among the 
 underwood. Cries of " Stop the villain !" resounded 
 from a hundred voices, and, aided by branches, bushes, 
 &c., the whole troop scrambled, in the brigand's track, 
 down the declivity ; but, ere they had anything like 
 thridded the steep bye-path, which conducted to the 
 thoroughfare, the Count reached the little rustic struc- 
 ture of unhewn timber, that spanned the stream 
 at the narrow, and stood, for an instant, swinging his 
 knightly prize, half-way over the crossing. "Take the 
 reward of thy officiousness, old John Banffy, as thou 
 callest thyself," cried Ragotzy, " and be more careful, 
 henceforth, how thou venturest to threaten the Cygani 
 leader, Alaric Polgar." Having thus spoken, he dropped 
 the knight headlong into the stream ; and, ere the men- 
 at-arms. arrived on the bridge, to the assistance of their 
 chief, Count Ragotzy 's form was descried far away, 
 shooting like a meteor athwart the strath. Some of the 
 party, however, would not desist from the pursuit, but 
 they presently returned, and reported the fact of the 
 Cygani, having sought refuge within the imperial lines. 
 
 Meantime, by the dispersion of the guards, our hero 
 and the fair daughter of Vicchy, found themselves unex-

 pectedly liberated, having '^nobody with them at sea - 
 but themselves," in the solitude of the forest. Veronica 
 had stood leaning against a tree during the hubbub ; 
 but not all her previous state of apprehension, had caused 
 such an emotion, as that with which her bosom now flut- 
 tered. Never was the flush of her loveliness more 
 dazzling. Her eyes were radiant with thankfulness, and 
 the glow of grateful feelings shone, through the medium 
 of her transparent features. With graceful embarrass- 
 ment, having expressed her acknowledgments for the 
 services, which Sigismund would have rendered her, she 
 earnestly entreated him to reconduct her to her father. 
 
 The young count readily acceded to her request, ob- 
 serving, as they struck into the opposite path, " that the 
 troop of Vicchy had suffered him, on his parole, to join 
 in pursuit of the infamous Cygani, and that, however 
 incalculably precious his freedom of action was to him, 
 just then, he still felt himself bound to render up his 
 person, into their hands." 
 
 7\gain Veronica's eyes gazed upon her preserver, with 
 an expression, in which the most confiding dependence, 
 and the most feminine admiration were involuntarily 
 blended. The pair, for some time, mutually lost in the 
 depths of tender thought, and with scarcely the exchange 
 of a word, followed back the path, which the damsel and 
 her ruthless captor had before trod. At length, Sigis- 
 mund, while assisting his fair companion over the 
 stepping-stones of a shallow brook, broke the embarrass- 
 ing silence, by proceeding to inquire, how she came to be 
 concealed in that lonely hut ; at the same time express- 
 ing his surprise, at her having eluded the notice of the 
 brigand, and Count Maylat, during their sojourn therein. 
 In return, he learned, that Walter, (whom, during his 
 short detention in the brigand's cave, our hero had gained 
 over to his services), agreeably to the plan, which he and 
 Sigismund had chalked out, in Veronica's presence, the 
 day before, had safely effected her deliverance. He

 had afterwards conducted her to that ruinous hovel, 
 where Sigismund, to his no small amazement, be- 
 held her, just as she fainted off in her father's arms ; 
 *' but it was through very joy," she said, looking our hero 
 full in the face, with a touching, and most feminine ex- 
 pression of interest and reliance; "Walter told me," 
 proceeded Veronica, " he had a deed to do, by your 
 orders, in the cunicular fortress, which, previous to 
 my escape from thence, he was unwilling to attempt. 
 This deed he left me, to accomplish, promising to return 
 to conduct me to some neighbouring village, as soon as 
 possible. You may conceive my terror, on the Cygani's 
 entering the ruinous tenement ; at first, mistaking that 
 horrible man for Walter, I was on the very brink of fall- 
 ing into the villain's hands : then I slunk, luckily with- 
 out being discovered, into the recess of the fire-place, 
 where, with little difficulty, I contrived to place myself 
 on a ledge, within its ample chimney ; nor did I descend, 
 till the voice of my father seemed to me an assurance 
 of safety. I recollect no more, till, to my indescribable 
 horror, I found myself seated in the company of that 
 Feni jereg^^ even where yonder crystal fount bubbles 
 forth its music." 
 
 Sigismund gazed upon the lovely narrator, with an in- 
 terest of a kind, he had never felt for any other human 
 being, as he listened to her account, with respectful and 
 absorbed attention. "Pray God!" he ejaculated, when 
 she had finished, " that Walter have indeed succeeded 
 in the object, whose importance, nevertheless, could 
 hardly justify him in leaving thee alone and unpro- 
 tected, in so desolate a spot." He paused, and then 
 turning to his fair companion, said, " I may yet, by the 
 blessing of Providence, obtain my freedom this night. 
 Dear lady Veronica," he continued, and at the tender 
 epithet, the damsel bent her head aside, to hide the

 tell-tale blood, which stole over her features ; ''If you 
 see Walter, intimate to him what has transpired, and 
 bid him have horses ready saddled, half a mile north-east 
 of the regent's camp. Will you do thus much for one, 
 
 who . Indeed, there may interests depend on your 
 
 kindness herein, of no ordinary magnitude ; but the na- 
 ture of which, this is neither the place, nor the occasion 
 to explain. Dear Lady Veronica," he repeated, " may 
 I rely on you ?" 
 
 The young lady was somewhat surprised, and no less 
 touched by the depth of feeling, with which Sigismund 
 delivered these last words. A vague and fluttering joy 
 stole to her heart. Mastering her emotions, however, 
 she expressed her readiness to do his message, and at 
 this moment the abstracted pair were surprised to find, 
 (and, truth to say, the illusions which were rising fast 
 within their bosoms, were somewhat ungratefully dissi- 
 pated) that they had already threaded the distance to 
 the lonely hut, at the entrance of which we leave them, 
 to give an account of themselves to the wounded sire, 
 (who was still awaiting some sort of litter from the camp) 
 and relate the manner of the young lady's rescue, " after 
 such flourish " as seemeth meet to the gentle girl, and 
 her gallant deliverer.

 The course of our story follows, at present, the fortunes 
 of its hero. Within an hour after having lost sight of 
 him, at the close of the last manuscript, we find Count 
 Rodna introduced into a small solitary tent, guarded by 
 a few men-at-arms, who had formed part of the corps of 
 Vicchy. He supposed, that his attendants would have at 
 once conveyed him before Martinuzzi, but on his arrival 
 at the Hungarian camp, he learned, to his no small 
 chagrin, that the regent, shortly after midnight, had 
 crossed .the river with the greater part of his army. The 
 remaining division was in their course of passage, and it 
 was calculated, that ere dawn, not an Hungarian soldier, 
 or straggling follower of the camp, would be left behind. 
 These tidings were peculiarly distressing to Sigismund ; 
 and only by a powerful effort, could he control his emo- 
 tion sufficiently to inquire, who was the officer imme- 
 diately in command? From the reply, which he had some 
 difficulty to elicit, he learned, that Valentinian, Count Tu- 
 rascus, yet remained on the hither side tlie Samos, su- 
 perintending the embarkation of the men. Sigismund 
 then demanded to be brought to speech of the count,

 without delay. The serjeant-at-arms, to whom he ap- 
 plied himself, surveyed our hero, with a strict eye, from 
 crown to heel, before he made answer. There was some- 
 thing in the commanding form, and in the air, voice, and 
 manner, of the young kanactz, which, notwithstanding 
 the associated remembrance of the generic disrepute of 
 his class, and the unfavourable accident of his being 
 under arrest, filled the mind of the armed official, with, 
 he knew not what impression of awe and reverence. 
 
 The more he strove to divest himself of that feeling of 
 deference, which stole over him in the presence of Sigis- 
 mund, the more he found, in spite of every effort, his 
 unwilling spirit borne down, as at the address of a person, 
 to whom high command, and important duties were 
 familiar. Still the military habits of the man rebelled, 
 strongly, against that higher instinct of his nature, which 
 made him sensible of the innate dignity of the captive 
 cattle keeper. In consequence of this internal debate, 
 it was after some preliminary hesitancy, that the Serjeant 
 adjusted his reply. 
 
 '* Do you see, sir kanactz," he said, leaning on his 
 arquebuse, '' it were not regular, nor mayhap quite safe, 
 for me to trouble the general, at so critical a time, about 
 any meaner matter, than that in which he is at present 
 engaged. And such, I reckon," he added, with a half 
 smile, '' must be, aught that you can have to say to his 
 noble countship. Suppose, my untimely importunity 
 cause him to hand me over to the camp-marshal : — only 
 think of that !" 
 
 '' Believe me, jobb emherem,''^' answered Sigismund; 
 '' it is of the last consequence to the very existence of 
 the Hungarian army, that I should instantly confer with 
 thegraf; an hour hence, and my tidings will come too 
 late." 
 
 " Sir kanactz," replied the man, " I'll do the most I

 can : if it be the general's pleasure to have you brought 
 before him, well and good ; if not, I would, 1 be not 
 made responsible for my officiousness, in drawing off his 
 attention from the business in hand. So only think of 
 that!" 
 
 " My good soldier," said Sigismund, "you need fear 
 nought." Then after a pause, during which a sudden 
 thought seemed to cross his mind, he added, " Do you 
 deliver this hangier to Count Turascus, and say, the son 
 of the man, whose property it formerly was, demands an 
 interview." With these words, Sigismund displayed a 
 small ornamented dirk, which he handed over to the 
 Serjeant. 
 
 " Only to think of this!" cried the latter; and then with 
 a grave elongation of countenance, he added; " I know 
 not whether, in undertaking this mission, I be not fol- 
 lowing those false fires, without light or heat, that lure 
 one to one's doom; but spite of devil and die polter

 tered in the land." 
 
 " My father obtained this little instrument at the battle 
 of Tocai.," said Sigismund. 
 
 "What! only to think of that! — Indeed! I have 
 heard speak of that fatal day, — but under what banner ? 
 Ha! take back the trophy, acquired by the disaster of 
 my native country ! Thy father, sir kanactz, — take it 
 back, — fought for the Austrians." 
 
 " No, by my soul !" exclaimed Sigismund ; " he fought 
 beneath the Hungarian colours, upheld by Count Turas- 
 cus,! he played a brave part all day, and only quitted 
 the field at night-fall, in company with King John."

 " Say you so? Oh how I honour him!" cried the. 
 Serjeant; " I will do your behest. — And this poignard?" 
 
 '* — Was placed by Count Turascus, opportunely, within 
 my father's hands, when the melee was at the hottest ; 
 and being hard pressed, it contributed to save his life," 
 replied Sigismund. 
 
 " Only to think of that! — but I understand," said the 
 subaltern; — " a reward of valour? I'll do your message to 
 the count, sir kanactz, — I'll do your message ; tarry 
 here in the dark, with that assurance to light up thy 
 loneliness. Yonder, by good luck, are two men-at-arms, 
 whom I will post at the entrance, — more for matter of 
 form, do you see, than anything else, — ay, ay, — only for 
 form sake, sir kanactz ; but a soldier must, above all 
 things, mind his duty, — and the general, would marvel 
 much, on coming up, if he found my prisoner unguarded. 
 Ave Mary! only to think of that!" With this ejaculation, 
 after committing the person of Sigismund to the custody 
 of the men in question, the serjeant-at-arms hied him to 
 the banks of the Samos. 
 
 Meantime, the reflections which agitated the mind of 
 Sigismund, were not of the most tranquil character. 
 The cold grey of dawn already crept over the heavens, 
 and stole insensibly on the darkness of the night; and 
 the youth trembled to think, that unless he were speedily 
 liberated, he would be disabled, from performing that 
 decisive part in the bloody business of the forthcoming 
 day, which he had long meditated, and the nature of 
 which will more particularly appear in the sequel. He 
 walked to and fro with an agitated frame, and impetuous 
 but interrupted steps, within the limits of the tent, as if 
 action were some relief to the intolerable suspense, which 
 racked his bosom. Weighty cares pressed upon his 
 
 revenues of the bishopric of Alba-Julia, bore the Hungarian standard at 
 the battle of Tocai. He was taken prisoner, and (says the historian),

 mind, and he stopped from time to time, — now in hopes, 
 his ears mig-ht catcli the approach of Turascus; and 
 again, as if to arrest the ideas, which shot across the re- 
 gion of his brain, with trackless swiftness, and consider 
 them with greater accuracy, He felt, that it was the 
 crisis of his fortunes, and that a few hours would either 
 pave the way to a brilliant destiny, or perchance, consign 
 him to an obscure grave, unhonoured, unwept, undistin- 
 guished, and unknown. Such an apprehension fell, like 
 an ice-bolt, on the soaring spirit of Count Rodna. 
 
 '* It is not loss of life, I care for," he said, internally; 
 *' to the equal mind of a warrior, the gory skeleton hath 
 no terrors ; but to me, he threatens more than mere ex- 
 tinction of breath, — he approaches, as the climax of a 
 series of humiliation and subterfuge ; he sets the seal of 
 his fatal dart on the long cares, that have, since child- 
 hood, tainted the healthful freshness of my cheek, and 
 stolen the very life from my heart. In his shadowy lure 
 he shuts out those aspirations of fame, which have been 
 my prayer and dream, during many years; — a prayer so 
 fervent, as to have all the quality of faith, and a dream 
 so sweet, as to fall on my soul like an oblivious antidote 
 to grief, transforming into an airy structure of delight, 
 the house of bondage itself. No ; death comes not to 
 me, as he comes to others. Hungary, in my fall, will 
 lose, unknowingly, one, consecrate and set apart to her 
 defence and service. And why, at this instant, do my 
 thoughts revert to death ? Is it not, because I feel it to be 
 the happier alternative. Oh ! better far to die, than live 
 longer as I have lived; better, the son of my father, 
 now he is acquainted with his rights, were laid beside 
 him in his dark chamber, than witness the fair land of 
 his birth bestrode by an usurper; or worse, consigned 
 over, all clogged with foreign wars and internal dissen- 
 sions, to the false and feeble sovereignty of a weak 
 maiden!" He paused in his mental soliloquy, near the 
 entrance of the tent to listen; then, after awhile, his

 mind and body simultaneously resumed the exercise of- 
 their powers. "Yes," he said, as he strode across the 
 tent: *' my fate hath brought me at last to this most 
 perilous and doubtful crisis, but my single chance of 
 coming off triumphant, depends on Count Turascus. 
 Alas! if he lag much longer, Coloswar is like to page 
 with Warna* and with Mohacs. The Basha Achamates, 
 will scarcely make a demonstration in favour of Marti- 
 nuzzi; — the correspondence of the Ottoman emperor with 
 the Moldavian waivode, discovers his alienation from the 
 regent's interests, and betrays a deep-rooted dread of his 
 abilities. If Martinuzzi, as I misdoubt, rely on the co- 
 operation of the Turk, he trusts to a rotten reed." 
 Sigismund paused on this reflection, which, by a natural 
 association, induced a new train of thought. His mind 
 adverted to the conspiracy of the magnats, which com- 
 prehended the execrable design of Count Ragotzy. — 
 " I took up my sojourn in the brigand's den," he said, 
 '' with the view of destroying, root and branch, that 
 villain's means of laying waste the land. This sudden 
 press of time and circumstances, will yet, belike, prove 
 his reprieve from justice. I would have henceforth 
 averted these outrages from Hungary. I have done 
 no more than insure the personal liberty of her regent 
 for a day. So far, however, on such a day as this, — 'tis 
 well, — but these traitor magnats will certainly fall off 
 during the engagement, from whatever various motives, 
 when it comes to the trial, they will make it no point of 
 honour, to fight to the death in his cause, to whose au- 
 thority they are so ill inclined. And now, forewarned, 
 fore-armed, Piadena will be drawn out in dreadful array 
 of battle, and instead of taking the invaders by surprise, 
 the regent will himself be surprised. *' Would to God,"

 exclaimed Sigismund, with impassioned feeling-, '' I were 
 free, to avert so fatal a catastrophe from Hungary, as 
 at this hour impendeth! Still, still, Turascus comes not. 
 Heaven and earth ! Suppose he have crossed the water! 
 My brain's on fire, — the day cometh on apace, — oh that 
 I were without these lines, aback of my gallant steed!" 
 The speaker hushed his voice, and for the twentieth time 
 within the last half-hour, abruptly arrested at once his 
 steps and his reflections. " Another minute elapsed!" he 
 presently said: " Another minute! when every most 
 trifling portion of time that finds me fettered, teems with 
 my own and country's destruction !" Again he listened 
 for awhile, but caught not the sound his ears thirsted for. 
 Throwing himself on his knees, he pressed both hands 
 to his brow with energetic force, — he would have prayed, 
 but his tongue felt parched, and his breathings were 
 stifled in his throat, — the nervous impatience of his soul 
 was testified by the big damp drops, that stood like beads 
 on his brow. " Oh that I were entangled in the swift 
 whirlwind !" he exclaimed, " so that it bore me away 
 to , but, hush ! Do I not hear the sounds of approach- 
 
 in 
 
 g voices 
 
 Sigismund sprung to his feet, and, rushing to a sort 
 of hanging, which dropped down before the entrance, 
 bent every nerve in an attitude of listening. He could 
 distinguish the accents of two persons, conversing in a 
 low tone ; but Sigismund's hopes fell still-born on his 
 heart, at discovering the speakers to be the men-at-arms, 
 who were keeping guard over him. Involuntarily, he 
 caught a glimmering of their subject of discourse ; but it 
 appeared so little interesting to him, in his present state 
 of morbid impatience, that, if an after-occurrence had 
 not thrown some light on the matter, it is probable, it 
 would have left no trace whatever on his mind. 
 
 *' So," said one of the men-at-arms, " the Count 
 Balassi's horsemen are like to roam at large over the

 pusztas* of Transylvania, and turn false wsarows,! like' 
 many true men before them." 
 
 " Why, comrade," replied the other soldier, '' they 
 are invited, d'ye see, in some sort, by their very loss, to 
 meditate, for themselves, their proper destination : though, 
 by'r lady ! in the lifetime of their chief, they were hardly 
 better disciplined, than a band of ordinary Wallachian 
 depredators, and conducted themselves, commonly, as 
 riotous and as unruly as ever did Peter the Bloody's dare- 
 devils, before that richter, they call Vilez Iwan, stopped 
 short his career." 
 
 " There's reason in what you say," observed the first 
 speaker, — " the Count Balassi, and the Moldavian 
 prince, understood each other tolerably well, or his graf- 
 ship is sadly belied." 
 
 " Ay, ay," was the response, " not a whit to choose 
 between them, save, indeed, that Balassi never turned 
 infidel, which, belike, will make some difference in their 
 present treatm.ent. However, talking of infidels, you 
 may lay this up in your mind, an' you will ; — he that 
 did the deed, will be sent to bear the soul of Balassi 
 company ere sunrise !" 
 
 *'What! Abu Obeida, the emir ? — Well, I should 
 guess as much, if you had not told me; — by the holy 
 mass ! the lances of Balassi ever loved their leader." 
 
 " I overheard," said the other interlocutor, " some 
 half dozen devise how to waylay the Turk, on his road 
 to the camp of the Basha Achamates, which, as I under- 
 stand, lies not many leagues distant." 
 
 " Hath, then, the Emir departed ?" demanded the 
 first speaker. 
 
 *' Yes; and, to judge from the scowl on his brow, in 
 no little heat ; but he'll be cooler anon ; — it is not long 
 since, he left, in company with one Halis, a captain of

 sives from Hermanstadt. — But stand to your arms, com- 
 rade, lo ! the genera] !" 
 
 At that moment. Count Turascus came up, with hur- 
 ried footsteps, and a bewildered expression of counte- 
 nance, holding in his hand the token, which tlie subaltern 
 had been directed to present to him. He was attended 
 by that person, whom, passing within the entrance of the 
 tent, he ordered, in a troubled voice, to keep guard on 
 the outside. " Quit not the spot, Yosa/'* be added, " I 
 may require your services." Several minutes elapsed 
 before the count again showed himself, and Sigismund 
 accompanied him into the chill, sharp twilight, of the 
 new-born day. He was replying to the pretended cattle- 
 keeper, when the eye of the serjeant-at-arms lit on their 
 emerging forms. " In that, and all things else," said 
 Turascus, in a broken tone, whilst the big tears rapidly 
 chased one another, down the furrows of his manly 
 cheek, "command me." And, with these words, having 
 rebuckled the broad belt, that girt his waist, he presented 
 it, together with the sheathed weapon by his side, with 
 respectful courtesy, into Sigismund's hands, who, grace- 
 fully receiving it, said — 
 
 " Many thanks, my dear lord ; and, please God, we 
 may yet meet ere the day be many hours older, — but 
 our parting here must needs be as abrupt, as our intro- 
 duction. — Farewell ! wave ceremony. — To the regent ! 
 Show him the peril which environs him. — Ha !" he 
 suddenly broke off, " Good God ! you will be too late ! — 
 hark to those cannon !" 
 
 Turascus' countenance fell, as he, together with the 
 subaltern and the two men-at-arms, bent their heads 
 aside, and hushed their breath to catch, at intervals, the 
 booming of the martial thunder, in the neiglibourhood of 
 Coloswar. It awoke the drowsy morn, and thrilled

 thioug'h the still air, like the pang of day-break, for the- 
 horrors, which were about to be enacted. The simulta- 
 neous prayer to Heaven, which burst, at that moment, 
 from the lips of the half-dozen true Hungarians, might 
 be pronounced, in more than one point of view, sublime. 
 Sigismund first broke the entranced impression, which 
 the sudden announcement of battle produced on each of 
 their minds. 
 
 *' Count Turascus," he cried, " the engagement has 
 already commenced, — haste to your post, — my mind 
 misgives me, that the day will go against you ; but, 
 while one true patriot stands to his arms, surrender not — 
 Jli/ not. Tell the regent, only to keep his ground, at 
 whatever cost, and Hungary may yet be saved." The 
 eyes of Sigismund gleamed in accordance with his gal- 
 lant spirit, and his ever fine form became even more im- 
 posing, under the influence of his feelings. After reflect- 
 ing for a minute, he suddenly demanded, " Who bears 
 your colours ?" 
 
 " For whom Martinuzzi reserves that important charge, 
 I have not heard," said Turascus. 
 
 " Well, be he who he may, bid him," cried Sigismund, 
 with an air and emphasis of inexpressible grandeur, 
 *' hack his spurs from his heels, and exalt the ensign on 
 one spot, rescue or no rescue, while the current of life 
 courses in his veins. This day shall manifest the wisdom 
 of our country's practice, and justify King Bela in the 
 eyes of posterity.* But breath and time are alike va- 
 luable. Can this man accompany me a short distance 
 to a spot, where I look to find a steed ready saddled, to 
 convey me — " Sigismund stopped short. 
 
 *' Whither, at such a time, my noble lord," cried Tu- 
 rascus, " in the name of Heaven ?" 
 
 * The custom of the ensign who carried the national standard, wear- 
 ing no spurs in battle, to prevent his quitting the field, originated with 
 King Bela I. It was the occasion of frequent disasters, and the loss of 
 the battle of Tocai ought probably to be attributed to that cause.

 "It were long to explain my destination," replied 
 Sigisraund. ^'Enough — we may meet ere sunset; till 
 when, the good genius of Hungary wait upon you ! — 
 no ceremony — adieu!" Sigismund turned away, and 
 Count Turascns bidding the subaltern assist the strange 
 young noble to horse, gazed for a minute after him, with 
 a countenance, in which mournful surprise, was strongly 
 depicted, and then directed his rapid steps across the 
 Samos, where, vaulting on his war-horse, he gave him 
 the rein, and with impetuous speed darted by the troops, 
 as they were forming in battle array, to where, on a 
 more elevated part of the ground, his practised eye dis- 
 tinguished the regent, amid a group of chiefs and prin- 
 cipal officers. Meanwhile return we to Count Rodna, 
 who, at a brisk pace, measured the distance, between the 
 regent's deserted cantonment and a certain point of the 
 umbrageous barrier, whither he directed his steps. The 
 subaltern followed close at his heels for a minute or two, 
 in silence ; but perceiving no likelihood of his compa- 
 nion addressing him, his curiosity shortly got the better 
 even of his involuntary deference for the pretended 
 cattle-keeper. He came up closer, and looking in the 
 kanactz's face, with a half-furtive, half-inquiring glance, 
 said, '* If I may take the liberty, sir, I should not be 
 greatly surprised to learn, that your profession be not 
 the tending of cattle, after all." He stopped ; but finding 
 his observation elicited no reply, presently resumed — 
 "^ A sort of masquerading, belike ?" Another pause en- 
 sued, to no more purpose than the preceding. " It may 
 be, your disguisement is meant to prove of service to our 
 beloved regent ?" 
 
 Sigismund turned a look on the speaker, whose sha- 
 dowy paleness deepened into something like displeasure. 
 *' Beloved !" he murmured, under his breath. 
 
 The Serjeant remarked the pallid cast of his counte- 
 nance, but misapprehended the cause. " You look worn, 
 sir, from the effects of last night's want of rest," he said.

 " Ay, beloved, indeed, is Martiniizzi, save by certain 
 grandees, wlio envy him his genius and his virtues. I 
 have good cause to honor him : it is not many weeks, 
 since he promoted me to my present rank, and that," he 
 continued, erecting his tail person, with an air of mili- 
 tary pride, " without a breath of solicitation on my part, 
 but nierely from what he heard of my military character. 
 Only think of that !" 
 
 This seemed a favorite topic with our subaltern ; and 
 he talked on, as if merely to gratify his loquacious hu- 
 mour. "There was many a grade got in our corps, 
 when captain Hubert was sent to prison, for treasonable 
 practices." 
 
 Sigismund looked up, and his face discovered a greater 
 expression of interest, than his pale features, previously, 
 exhibited. 
 
 The subaltern observed the change, and taking it for 
 a sort of encouragement, thus continued — " 'Twas a sad 
 affair, to be sure — it came like a sudden shock to all our 
 men, the next day, although I could have told them, — 
 but that is neither here nor there." Here the subaltern's 
 communication and his march, together came to a full 
 stop. He and Sigismund arrived beneath a group of 
 walnut-trees, whose implicated leaves charged the thin 
 autumnal air of morn, with delicious fragrance. Near 
 this grove, they observed a man, dressed in a sort of 
 military habit, leading up and down two war-horses, with 
 appropriate furniture. 
 
 " Walter, thou art punctual, and thy being here at all, 
 I take to be a good omen," said Sigismund. 
 
 The person addressed, after making a profound reve- 
 rence, proceeded to inform the young count of his having 
 waited, under cover of the trees, since the earliest peep 
 of dawn. I singled out the place of appointment," he 
 said, " agreeably to the direction of the lady." 
 
 " We'll speak of that anon," interrupted Sigismund, 
 as he mounted one of the gallant destriers. " My friend,"

 he said, addressing the bewildered subaltern, '' receive 
 my thanks for having borne my message to Count Tu- 
 rascus, — thanks are all that I have now to offer ; but, lest^ 
 peradventure, hereafter, my power should coincide with 
 my will to be of service, tell me how thou art called?" 
 
 *' My name is Yosa," answered the serjeant, 
 
 " My gratitude shall fasten that name on my memory," 
 said Sigismund. " Farewell, Yosa !" And, saying these 
 words, the young count and his attendant galloped off, 
 cutting the waste air, as if they were the incarnate spirits 
 of the hurricane. 
 
 For some minutes the subaltern stood gazing after 
 them in apparent consternation, at the velocity of their 
 progress, as the horsemen appeared and disappeared, 
 among the trees, in the curvatures of their path, till 
 they were wholly lost, behind the numberless boles that 
 occupied, in dark lines, the rapidly extending space of 
 the intermediate woodland. Then he stood for a minute 
 as if stupified, and might have remained so still longer, 
 if the dropping succession of distant shots, sounding like 
 the first '' big drops" of the thunder-cloud, which pre- 
 cede the tempest, had not recalled him to himself. 
 *' Well, only think of that !" cried Yosa, as, collecting 
 his astonished faculties, he retraced his steps, at a brisk 
 pace, towards the site of the deserted camp, which again 
 partook of the solitude, that pervaded the vast forest, 
 with which it was, in a great measure, encompassed. 
 
 Meanwhile, as if incarnate death were in pursuit, the 
 ground disappeared, from under the horses' hoofs of Sigis- 
 mund and his companion, and they traversed the sweep- 
 ing range of hills, over which their road wound, without 
 drawing in rein ; nor did they slacken their pace, till 
 they were passing through an avenue of leafless larch and 
 lilac trees, which made the characteristic approach to the 
 few Transylvanian hamlets, that were dispersed over those 
 thinly-populated cattle-farms.*

 At the entrance of a village of mud-built huts, rudely 
 constructed as those of an Indian wigwam, they found, to 
 their great chagrin, the causeway almost blocked up, by 
 a concourse of persons of all ages and sexes, who were 
 awaiting the coming forth of a devout procession of the 
 peasantry, which at that early hour, was commencing its 
 pilgrimage to some miraculous fount, slowly, and with 
 difficulty, our horsemen thridded their way, through the 
 dense assemblage of human bodies, gay in their motley 
 holiday attire, of yellow, green, and purple cloth, and 
 proportionably elevated and noisy. The crowd sometimes 
 opened in a lane, but oftener impeded the progress of the 
 travellers with vacant recklessness. These people were 
 arrayed, for the most part, in the national dress of Tran- 
 sylvania, the arrangement of which, is particularly im- 
 posing, and its almost classical effect has been campared 
 to that of the costume of the peasantry of the Roman 
 empire. They wore a tunic of white cloth, which, where 
 it terminated about the knees, was finished off by a broad 
 stripe of coloured wool — the pantaloons descended, in 
 elaborate folds, and the goat-skin sandals were secured 
 to the foot and ancle, by the aid of reticulated strings. 
 The enormous calpac, in the shape of an inverted cone, 
 lightly surmounted the head ; the nape of the neck was 
 left entirely bare, while the hair in front was worn a la 
 Brutus, instead of its being plaited all round, and tied in 
 knots, as among the Magyari. 
 
 One of these picturesque personages, after having been 
 almost trodden down by Sigismund, owing partly to the 
 tardiness of the man's movements, and in part to that 
 strong impulse, in the mind of our hero, which urged him 
 forwards to the performance of its ministry, at whatever 
 risk, shouted after him — " Have a care, young kanactz, 
 or you may chance to be unhorsed, as happened to a 
 certain Turk not long ago." 
 
 Sigismund gave slight heed to the speaker, and, by 
 dint of skill and determination, at length fairly found

 himself entangled, within the single long narrow street 
 of the little village. Here he was compelled to draw up 
 on one side, to let the procession pass. A-head, marched 
 the curate *' proudly eminent," in his long purple cano- 
 nicals* with some dignity, but more difficulty, exalting 
 a rude and massive crucifix. A lingering line of youthful 
 acolytes, bearing a banner, where the figure of St. Helena 
 swung lazily on the autumnal air, and shone resplendent 
 on a field of azure, were close on his heels. After them 
 came some half hundred young damsels, in picturesque 
 attire, who, in a chant that filled the welkin, and ran 
 along the whole extent of the village, lifted up their 
 voices, in praise of the saint, to whose blessed station, 
 they were ostentatiously carrying, in the midst, a black 
 earthenware pitcher, moulded after some antique model. 
 This they purposed filling with the canonised maidens' 
 water. Two of the parochial dorfrichters, f supporting 
 certain emblems of Catholic worship, and draperied in 
 waving white surplices, brought up the rear, whilst an 
 eager curious multitude indiscriminately pressed upon 
 either flank of " the long drawn pomp," or with little 
 attention to order, but with more or less demonstration 
 of delight, devoutly followed in the wake. 
 
 The thinly thatched cottage, near which Sigismund un- 
 willingly checked his horse, stood a little detached, like 
 every other in the village. Its gable ends rose from the roof, 
 and, as was usual, it presented to the highway, the dis- 
 coloured wall of its lateral front. It was defended by a 
 slight enclosure or rail of wicket work, and was pierced by 
 two deep and small embrasures. The actual front of this 
 domicile ran back some short way, where, beneath a sort 
 of penthouse was enchained, for the time, the deep-mouth- 
 ed guardian of the premises, who having no " gentle Des-

 demona" to reconcile him to his '' circumscription and 
 restraint," yelped loudly to obtain his customary " un- 
 housed free condition." 
 
 " Would you wish to pass your horses within the gate, 
 and alight, till your road be clear, sir travellers ?" asked 
 a withered crone, standing within the jagged paling, in a 
 cracked and feeble tone of voice. 
 
 Sigismund was about to decline the invitation, but 
 being respectfully reminded by his companion, that both 
 steeds and riders, would be all the better able to prose- 
 cute their journey, after having taken some slight re- 
 fection, he acquiesced in the arrangement, and the next 
 minute saw our hero seated, before a pyramidical stove, 
 in the common sod-built room of the mean-looking abode, 
 which turned out to be one of those inferior hostelries, 
 mostly frequented by the lowest order o^ fuhrleutes or 
 carriers. A refreshment, consisting of sour-crout, brown 
 bread, and excellent butter, was speedily produced, and 
 laid on the rough wooden table, which made a fixture in 
 the middle of the apartment. 
 
 The old dame apologised, for not being provided with 
 better entertainment, which she ascribed to her having 
 already feasted divers parties that morning ; and she 
 lamented especially, that her last eggs had been swal- 
 lowed, not long before, by some mighty grandee of a Turk, 
 whose horse had stumbled, and thrown hi.ri on the rugged 
 pave, near the threshold of her inn. 
 
 Sigismund listened, with more apparent interest, than 
 he had previously exhibited, and inquired, whether the 
 Turk was quite alone when he chanced to fall, and being 
 informed, there were two journeying in company, the 
 discourse he had overheard that morning recurred to him, 
 and he concluded that these equestrians must have been 
 Abu Obeida, and the captain of the Janissaries. After 
 reflecting a moment on this information, a new train 
 of thought suggested itself to his mind. '' Abu Obeida 
 is the accredited agent of the sultan, and, therefore,

 his confidential friend," he argued internally. *' If I 
 could only prevail upon him to carry a message — no, — a 
 verbal message will be spent on air." Sigismund turned, 
 and addressing his hostess, requested writing materials. 
 
 That venerable body shook her head, in profound 
 amazement, observing, that during almost half a century, 
 that she and her dead husband before her, had kept a 
 public, she had never heard preferred, such an uncon- 
 scionable requisition. 
 
 ^' Are not implements for writing to be had in all Koras," 
 (such being the name of the straggling village, where 
 they were detained,) demanded Sigismund, with a gesture 
 of impatience. 
 
 " Nay thee now, sir kanactz, the inhabitants, I wis, 
 are no belated," was the rejoinder ; '' and yet, belike — " 
 the old dame paused. 
 
 " Ay, my good woman ; think again," said Sigismund, 
 encouragingly; '^ surely some one or other, must deal in 
 such commodities." 
 
 *' La, you there now ! 1 fear me nay," replied the 
 hostess ; *' yet I partly remember me, when I have been 
 up to confession, at Father Matthias's, to have seen 
 something of what you mention, on his reverence's table. 
 But, of a verity, the father is out on the pilgrimage." 
 
 " Nevertheless, would you not make the trial, whether 
 they are not to be had in his absence ? " inquired Sigis- 
 mund, at the same time enforcing his request, by that 
 clenching argument, which, in all times and countries, 
 accommodates itself to the meanest capacity, and soon 
 dissipates every scruple. 
 
 " Why marry, sir kanatcz," said the obliging dame, 
 *' the father's dwelling is no great step, across the field, 
 at the back of our hamlet, and I warrant me, if my 
 daughter Ernestine, who keeps house for his reverence, 
 could not contrive to get at the articles in demand. At 
 all events, I will do my best for your pieces;" and the 
 aged dame, incontinently, hobbled oft' to the curate's

 domicile, and was soon seen to return, to the high satis- 
 faction of Sigismund, bearing in her hands the requisite 
 materials. 
 
 Our hero, hastily traced a few lines, and then, having 
 folded the paper, in the shape of a missive, superscribed 
 and posited it about his person. Finding the proces- 
 sion had gone by, he prepared for departure. Whilst 
 mounting, he observed : — 
 
 " The Turkmen you spoke of, erewhiles, good woman, 
 were bound northward, I ween." 
 
 The old hostess looked at Sigismund, with a peculiar 
 expression of countenance, while shaking her lanky fin- 
 gers, in a most admonitory style, she made answer : — 
 " I will give you a bit of caution, in return for thy muni- 
 ficence, courteous sir kanactz, or whoever else thou art, 
 for my mind misdoubts me, thou art above thy seeming : 
 join not the company of those Turkmen, or thou may 
 chance to fare thee worse for it." 
 
 Extreme as was the anxiety of Sigismund, to spur on- 
 ward, there was something implied, in the voice and man- 
 ner of the woman, that obliged him to restrain his impa- 
 tience. " In Heaven's name !" he said ; " what doth thy 
 speech import ?" 
 
 ^'Thus much," replied the woman ; " whilst the tur- 
 baned lords, you asked about, were refreshing them- 
 selves, in my hostelry, arrives me, certain roving horse- 
 men, who live by the sword, and call for a flask of ko- 
 rosian : one of them alighted, and passed into the speise- 
 saal.* On his return, I overheard him say, to his com- 
 rades, that the infidels they were pursuing, were, at that 
 moment, carousing within; and then, not heeding my 
 presence, because I wot they deemed me deaf, or, at 
 least, too good a Christian to bewray their purpose, they 
 planned, in my hearing, to waylay the Turkmen, some 
 miles down the road, and, (she added, in a cautionary 
 
 * Speise-saal, — the common eating-room of an inn.

 MANUSCRIPT XXIII. 343 
 
 whisper,) and murder them, sir kanactz ! So, if you 
 would follow my counsel, an you come up with the un- 
 believers alive, as is not unlikely, from their slow rate of 
 travel, you would gallop by without taking- any notice ; 
 since the cutting off, in Erdely, of these Mahometans, 
 when opportunity serves, be no more than just you 
 wis." 
 
 On saying these last words, his prudent admonisher, 
 sagaciously bowed her head; and Sigismund, and his 
 attendant, were left to pursue their route, which they 
 did, with as great celerity, as the fleet animals that bore 
 them, could be urged to put forth. 
 
 They had measured about two leagues from Koras, 
 when, having surmounted the gradual ascent, which, 
 ever since they left that village, the road presented, they 
 found the summit commanded an expanse of undulating 
 woodland. For several miles, the eye might overlook the 
 heavy outlines of the vast forest, broken, here and there, 
 by the elevated crest of some giant tree, above the rest, 
 and trace, at intervals, the higher ridges of the waving 
 line, which they purposed following, sometimes glowino^ 
 radiant, in unexpected sunshine, but oftener veiled in 
 the grey mists of early morning. 
 
 Our hero's orb of sight, however, was not occupied 
 afar off, in piercing through the capricious haze of dis- 
 tance, but paused on objects more within its scope, as 
 well as more interesting. Half-way up a somewhat 
 steep acclivity, that lay right in their track, our travel- 
 lers could distinguish the stationary forms of armed 
 horsemen ; and as Sigismund's eye wandered to the spot, 
 he readily apprehended, they were the followers of Ba- 
 lassi, awaiting the coming up of the Emir, whose person, 
 together with that of his companion, was at present hid- 
 den in one of the intermediate hollows. 
 
 However powerful the impulse, which prompted our 
 hero, either to forewarn the Turk of his danger, or other- 
 wise to come in to his rescue, he found it no easy task.

 to analyze his motives. He had overheard his guards 
 discuss the manner of Balassi's death, and whatever 
 little sympathy there might have been, between himself 
 and that lawless magnat, he had, and could have, no 
 feelings in common with his ruthless murderer. He ac- 
 knowledged to himself, that the blood of the Turkish 
 basha, would be justly shed, in atonement for that of 
 the Hungarian noble ; but he felt an invincible repug- 
 nance, to the mode, in which the infidel's infraction of 
 the laws, both of nature, and of nature's origin, was to 
 meet its punishment. '^The murder of Balassi, is no 
 justification for Balassi's avengers perpetrating another 
 murder," he argued with himself, as instinctively, he put 
 his horse upon his quickest paces. 
 
 Whether his recollection of the missive, which he 
 meant Abu Obeida to transmit to Solyman, weighed 
 anything in the nice balancing of Sigismund's mind, we 
 cannot exactly determine. It is certain, his panting steed 
 charged the waste air, with flakes of visible foam, as our 
 hero impelled him headlong, down a declivity of con- 
 siderable sweep, and then, after continuing at the same 
 pace, along very little of the level in the valley, again 
 galloped up the opposite ascent. Having surmounted 
 the brow of the hill, overlooking a deep, wooded hollow, 
 that terminated in a rise, proportioned to the previous 
 descent, our hero perceived, that the objects of his 
 kind pursuit had already traversed the sweeping vale, 
 and were in the act of making their slow way, up the 
 acclivity. 
 
 The horsemen he had first noticed remained stationary 
 and were about a quarter of a mile in advance of their' 
 expected prey. Sigismund, however, animated by the 
 hope of being yet in time to come up to their rescue, 
 pushed on, without drawing in rein. Meantime, Abu 
 Obeida and his companion experienced some natural 
 misgivings, on observing the disposition of the five armed

 horsemen, about the middle of the ascent, up which they 
 were labouring. 
 
 ** Halis/' said Abu Obeida, "■ should yon Christians 
 seek to rob and murder us, as, by Allah ! seemeth to me 
 not unlikely, we must employ our wits, if we hope to 
 prevent them. I have nothing but my scymitar and 
 this hangier about me; but thou — what weapon hast 
 brought with thee ?" 
 
 " My lord," replied Halis, '' I regret to report, that 
 my slight kinskal * is all my means, defensive and offen- 
 sive. Might I presume to advise, I should recommend 
 our turning our horses' heads." 
 
 "That will I not, Halis," said Abu Obeida, " and for 
 two reasons ; one is, that as I never hitherto showed my 
 back to a foe, (for that matter of Vienna is scarcely an 
 exception,) so I were loath, my old age should shame my 
 past life. My other reason is, that from the brow of the 
 last hill, we descended, I descried in the distance a body 
 of acanziz, f hastening hitherward. They have doubt- 
 less been sent by Achamates for our escort, should we 
 require it. Allah kereem! God is merciful ! But mark 
 me," he continued, " the least symptom of hesitation on 
 our parts, which yonder men discover, will bring them, 
 if they mean hostilely, directly down upon us, and acce- 
 lerate the moment of their attack. Let us, therefore, 
 hold ourselves ready for the onset; but proceed, as if we 
 entertained no apprehensions of its occurring." 
 
 Thus pre-admonished, Halis alternately urged and re- 
 strained his horse, and both, without obviously altering 
 their rate of progress, maintained the most leisurely pace, 
 consistent with the idea of an ordinary journey. But, 
 however slowly they travelled, their steeds, at length, 
 brought them, where their expectant foes remained drawn 
 up across the road. '* Infidel dog !" — *' damned assas-

 sin V — '' bloody villain !" were the sort of objurgations, 
 freely showered upon the heads of the Ottomans, as the 
 angry, but faithful adherents of the murdered Balassi 
 pushed their steeds forward. 
 
 It happened, that three immense pyres, composed of 
 faggots, cut down and brought thither, from an adjacent 
 wood, had been left on one side of the road, within a 
 short space of the ground chosen for the assault. They 
 described three sides of a square, and formed a sort of 
 barricade, which could only be carried in front. Abu 
 Obeida, reconnoitring the ground, as he came near, by 
 an expressive look, had drawn the attention of his com- 
 panion to the fortilage, thus providentially provided. On 
 the purpose of the armed horsemen being evidenced 
 beyond a doubt, the Emir and the captain of janissaries 
 backed their steeds, as if by a concerted plan, and ere 
 the defensive movement could be prevented, had suc- 
 ceeded in entrenching themselves, within the convenient 
 recess. Having thus guarded against being surrounded, 
 the Ottomans prepared to repel the attack of their assail- 
 ants, with the courage and determination, befitting brave 
 men and experienced warriors. Neither party carried 
 fire-arms; — at the time of our story, they were imper- 
 fect, and, consequently, of infrequent use. 
 
 Deeply enraged at having chosen their ground with 
 such little foresight, as to leave room for the defensive 
 manoeuvre, they witnessed, the Hungarians spurred their 
 steeds, with bitter and loud invectives, towards the barri- 
 cade. The conflict which ensued lasted awhile, with- 
 out auguring any issue either way. So long as Abu 
 Obeida and his companion chose, to act on the defen- 
 sive, it was manifestly labour in vain to attempt to over- 
 come them. 
 
 Matters were at this point, when tlie besiegers, as if 
 wearied with encountering an opposition, on which they 
 had not calculated, conferred together a few paces apart. 
 Presently, they renewed the attack in front, whilst two

 of the party, dismounting, made a reconnoissance, and 
 ascertainedthere wouldbeno difficulty in taking their ene- 
 mies in the rear. Immediately they scaled the furthermost 
 pile of wood, and dropped themselves within the barri- 
 cade. Now, indeed, the danger of the Ottomans became 
 momentarily more imminent. The horse which Abu 
 Obeida sat was instantly hamstrung, and as the noble 
 animal essayed to plunge forward, the Emir felt himself 
 dragged from the saddle, and borne away from beyond 
 his wooden ramparts. The captain of janissaries per- 
 ceiving, at once, the unfortunate turn, which the combat 
 had taken, although hopeless of the event, resolved to 
 make the most of their sole remaining chance for victory. 
 As one of the captors of Abu Obeida passed under his 
 horse's neck, grasping the sword-arm of that Emir with 
 both hands, Halis stooped forward on his stirrup, and 
 well aware of the temper and sharpness of his curved 
 kinskalj waved it in the air, and then applied the weapon's 
 edge so dexterously to its object, that instantaneously the 
 head of the Hungarian rolled along the earth. Abu Obeida 
 forthwith engaged in a close grapple with the other as- 
 sailant, and the next moment both went down together. 
 Halis, meanwhile, thrust forward, with an irresistible and 
 crashing vigour, upon the Hungarians. This offensive 
 movement obtained for him at first, all the advantage of a 
 surprise ; and fetching a blow at his nearest opponent, 
 which felled him to the earth, he galloped over the pros- 
 trate body, to compel his other antagonists, to keep on the 
 defensive. These, however, met his assault with such 
 skill and determination, that Halis was fain to concen- 
 trate his every effort to his own preservation. One of 
 the twain, in consequence, shot past him, and, brandisli- 
 ing his spear aloft, urged his charger towards where Abu 
 Obeida rolled, gasping and struggling upon the ground, in 
 the death-gripe of his foeman. He was undermost — his 
 sabre lay broken in twain, some few paces off. The knee 
 of his foeman was on the breast of the Turk, and his

 hands firmly compressed the infidel's throat; but ere the 
 Hungarian had traversed the space, which divided him 
 from the combatants, he beheld his countryman rolling 
 lifeless in the dust, and the blade of Obeida's glittering 
 poignard was dyed, in the heart's blood of his all but con- 
 queror. 
 
 The Emir unloosed himself, from the relaxing grasp of 
 his late opponent, and slowly uprose. He was un- 
 wounded indeed, but breathless, wan, and disabled from 
 putting forth any adequate defence, against the avenging 
 horseman, whose bright spear was uplifted to strike him 
 to the dust. Standing totally defenceless, he raised his 
 reeking hangier to parry the intended thrust ; but his 
 arm shook ; and brain, and eye, alike reeled, beneath the 
 gleaming brand of the Hungarian. 
 
 '' Die, murderer of the noble Balassi ! — die!" ex- 
 claimed the late magnat's infuriate follower, and, at the 
 word, down came his ponderous steel, with a force, that 
 would have cloven the Ottoman asunder, but the thrust 
 was averted by Abu Obeida, through his very weakness. 
 He fortunately tottered aside, and his foeman had to 
 raise his arm anew, to repeat the blow. " Le destin des 
 hommes dependait d'un moment.'^ Suddenly, a loud 
 shout shook the air, and a war-horse, which had been 
 rushing, like a whirlwind, up the acclivity, and whose 
 flanks showed bloody tokens of his speed, came charged 
 with the burden of our chivalrous hero, on the scene of 
 action. Abu Obeida's death-stroke was, in the same 
 instant, intercepted, and the point of his opponent's 
 weapon struck up by the spear of Sigismund. 
 
 The astonished avenger of Balassi raised his head, 
 and turned indignantly, to confront this unlooked-for 
 adversary. Just as their blades crossed, the first lances 
 of the turbaned cavalry, whom Abu Obeida had ori- 
 ginally espied in the distance, glanced on the ridge of 
 the mountam, and the loud hail of Halis was answered by 
 shouts of " Ya Allah r from every mouth, as the whole

 troop, with the roar, at once, and the speed of an ava- 
 lanche, rolled down upon the combatants. The baffled 
 followers of the murdered magnat, did not care to abide 
 the coming storm ; they galloped off, in an opposite di- 
 rection, leaving three of their comrades lifeless, on the 
 hill-side. 
 
 Halis dismounted, and approached where the Emir 
 half-supported himself, on the arm of Sigismund, who, 
 immediately on the flight of the Hungarian, to whom he 
 had been opposed, had thrown himself from his charger. 
 '^ My lord," said the captain of janissaries, *' Allah fore- 
 fend your having received any bodily injury !" 
 
 " But for this person's gallantry, I should be now in 
 paradise, Halis," replied Abu Obeida. 
 
 The broken voice, and gasping breath of the Emir, 
 sufficiently attested, how greatly he had suffered, in the 
 desperate encounter. His antagonist had proved him- 
 self to be possessed of more, than ordinary muscular 
 power, and, though the Turk's spare frame had been 
 much inured to toil and hardship, still the mortal wrestle 
 with so strong a man, was almost too great an exertion 
 for one, at the advanced period of life, which Abu Obeida 
 had attained. The violent pressure on his chest, and 
 the sort of strangulation, induced by the gripe, that the 
 Hungarian, for a brief period of time, kept on his throat, 
 contributed, no doubt, to his consequent exhaustion. 
 And now, the troop of Acanziz drew up ; their plumed 
 turbans waving in the air, and their rich dresses, costly 
 cashmeres, and superb brocades, fluttering in gay and 
 gorgeous relief, to the precious trappings of their steeds, 
 and the martial garniture, that lurked beneath. 
 
 Witli extreme salutations of respect, certain of these 
 dismounted, and, after bowing almost to the earth, and 
 kissing the hem of his garment, assisted the Emir, on tlie 
 back of a superbly caparisoned Arabian, whose trappings 
 and housings were of silk and velvet, and reached to the 
 ground. "Wheeling about, the gorgeous cavalcade pre-

 pared to defile, after the captain of janissaries and his 
 companion, who were already considerably a-head. 
 
 Meanwhile, Sigismund, vaulting into his saddle, briefly 
 explained what he knew of the affair, to his astonished 
 attendant, who had just reached the scene of action. The 
 signal to proceed was now given, and the closely com- 
 pacted train of Mussulmans moved along, in a radiant 
 line, at their customary easy and luxuriant amble. 
 
 " Ride beside us, intrepid stranger," said Abu Obeida, 
 addressing our hero ; "we would willingly disburden 
 ourselves, according to our ability, of that great debt, 
 which thou hast just rendered us. In what mode would 
 you have me manifest, in the world's eye, my sense of 
 the obligation. Ask something of me, young sir, and 
 speak forth boldly." 
 
 Sigismund, with some coldness, made answer, that no 
 thanks were due to him, seeing that the Turkish cavalry, 
 by the opportuneness of their appearance, had put the 
 Emir's foes to flight. 
 
 " We know as much, young sir," returned Abu 
 Obeida, " but we likewise are conscious, that we are be- 
 holden to your good sword for having intercepted the ma- 
 rauder's stroke, ere it touched our life. Come, sir, name 
 the guerdon, at which you value your services ; for I 
 hold it, you have no right to leave us so greatly under 
 obligation, when, in any degree, it can be cancelled. 
 Trust me," continued Abu Obeida, observing that his 
 preserver still held silence, '' I can do much in Erdely ; 
 and the havings, that are at my beck, however inade- 
 quate to requite the warding off of that death stroke, — 
 few men, methinks, in thy rank of life, would con- 
 temn." 
 
 " My lord," said Sigismund, " I have but a single 
 request to prefer, the nature of which, however appa- 
 rently trivial, is of great importance to the interests of 
 the individual, who addresses you." 
 
 " Be pleased to state it," said Abu Obeida.

 " You are doubtless acquainted, my lord," returned 
 our hero, " whereabouts Sultan Solyman is at pre- 
 sent ?" 
 
 <« Why, in sooth, young Frank, you could scarcely 
 apply to any Ottoman, in all Erdely, so competent as 
 myself to give you information on that score," returned 
 Abu Obeida, glancing a look of peculiar intelligence on 
 the janissary captain, who rode, not quite abreast, at his 
 bridle hand. 
 
 '* Then, my lord," said Sigismund, producing the un- 
 sealed missive from his vest, " I have only this to say, — 
 you will amply reward me, for whatever service I may 
 have had the good fortune to render you, if you will only 
 transmit this paper, with all possible despatch, and by 
 sure hands, to your gracious master." And, making an 
 obeisance, not exactly in keeping with his characteristic 
 style of dress, Sigismund presented the paper to the 
 Emir. 
 
 Abu Obeida received it, with a mixture of indifference 
 and curiosity. His eye lit on the superscription — " For the 
 Suit an Solyman' — he repeated, "brief! — short, hey, Halis? 
 brief address! the Sultan Solyman !* — So, most easily 
 requited, Frank. If I understand you right, you would 
 
 * Brief, hey, Halis? — Brief in comparison with the sultan's enume- 
 ration of titles, in a letter to Ferdinand, running thus : — "I, the lord of 
 lords, ruler of the East and of the West, who am of power to do, or not to 
 do whatsoever pleaseth me, lord of all Graecia, Persia, and Arabia, com- 
 mander of all things which can be subject to king and command, the 
 great worthy of these times, and strong champion of the most wide world, 
 lord of all the White and Black Sea, and of the holy city of Mecca, shining 
 with the brightness of God, and of the city of Medina, and of the holy 
 and chaste city of Jerusalem ; King of the most noble kingdom of Egypt, 
 lord of Jonia, and of the city of Athens, signor of the sacred temple of 
 God, Zabilon and Bassio, Bethjan and Magodim, the seat and throne of 
 the great king Nashim lletham, and lord of the island of Algiers ; Prince 
 of the kingdoms of Tartary, Mesopotamia Media, of the Georgians,

 wish the contents of this letter to be perused by his high- 
 ness, without any delay that can be avoided." 
 
 " Exactly so, sir," replied Sigismund, with some 
 haughtiness, not altogether approving the peculiar, and 
 sinister expression of countenance, with which he could 
 not help fancying, the Emir regarded him. 
 
 " Well, sir," observed Abu Obeida, " you must be 
 informed, that never is any kind of document or petition 
 considered by the sultan, without having previously fallen 
 under the inspection of the individual by your side. You 
 are so far fortunate — the missive is not sealed, I see — so — 
 by your leave " 
 
 " Sir Emir," cried Sigismund, in manifest anger — " if 
 such be your title — I will not permit this. That writ- 
 ing you hold in your hands, is of such import, that it 
 can be submitted to no meaner eyes, than those of Soly- 
 man ; therefore, if you do not think fit, to lay it before 
 the emperor unread, — I would be obliged by your re- 
 turning it into my hands." 
 
 " You are strangely captious, methinks, sir Frank," 
 
 Sultan Selim, who hath power from God to rule all people with a bridle, 
 and strength to break open the gates and bars of all cities and strong 
 places, unto whose mighty hands are delivered all the ends of the world, 
 none excepted ; I, the ruler of the East from the island of Isein unto the 
 furthest bounds of Africa, whom God hath appointed a mighty warrior 
 in the edge of the sword, amongst whose most mighty kingdom, the im- 
 pregnable castle of Caesaria is reputed for the least, and in whose here- 
 ditary dominions the kingdom or empire of Alexander the Great is ac- 
 counted of as a trifle, with me is the strength of the whole world, and 
 virtue of the firmament. For as much as thou king Ferdinand, and 
 elected emperor of the Roman people, of Bohemia, Vandalia, Crabatia, 
 and many other countries, king and lord." 
 
 The following commencement of an epistle addressed to Henry VIII., 
 copied from a record in the Heralds' College, is also curious. " I king of 
 kings, and lord of lords, emperor of Babylon, steward of Hell, porter of 
 Paradise, constable of Jerusalem, flower of the Universe, and cousin to 
 the great God." 
 
 There is moreover cited, a speech of Solyman to John of Zapola, by 
 Laurentius Toppeltinus, Ortus et Occasus Transilv. p. 174, seq. that far 
 out-herods either of the foregoing. It is too long to insert.

 returned the Emir, " I would only open your letter, as a 
 necessary preliminary to Solyman's being speedily made 
 accquainted with its contents. A moment ago, you de- 
 sired me to use all despatch herein, and now complain 
 of my attention to your wish : if the matter of this 
 paper be not meant to be subjected to my perusal, why, 
 then," — and the Emir smiled and shrugged his shoulders ; 
 " by the tomb of Mahomet ! Sultan Solyman shall and 
 will never be cognizant of it." 
 
 '* We will try that, sir," said Sigismund, with consi- 
 derable dignity ; '' at all events, I shall seek another, if 
 not a trustier messenger. From the latest intelligence of 
 the sultan's movements, I am aware that, not long since, 
 he was camped in the White City,* thither, in the first 
 instance, I shall forward my epistle. Restore it to me, 
 sir Emir." 
 
 Sigismund held out his hand to receive back the folded 
 paper ; but Abu Obeida, as if totally indifferent to the 
 action, carelessly observed, " 'Tis now nearly a month, I 
 trow, since Sultan Solyman left Belgrade — your letter 
 cannot reach its destination more directly, than through 
 my hands." 
 
 ** But itsi ntegrity !" began Sigismund ; when the Emir 
 interrupted him, and assuming a mien and mode of ad- 
 dress, uncommonly dignified, said, in a low deep voice, 
 every tone of which was instinct with command, and 
 majesty ; " Enough of this, young Frank, the integrity of 
 your letter cannot be tampered with, before it reaches 
 the personage to whom it is superscribed ; for I, who hold 
 it, am myself Sultan Solyman." 
 
 Sigismund at once felt, that this avowal needed not 
 corroboration, and he was only surprised at himself, that 
 he had not before surmised the fact. He instantly made 
 a deep reverence ; but even in tliat obeisance of his head, 
 sat grace and dignity, — his was the respectful acknow-

 ledgment of the body, but not the prostration of the 
 spirit, and indicated rather the humility of an equal, than 
 the servility of a vassal. 
 
 " Now, we hope, we may read your petition, sir 
 stranger," said the Imperial Mussulman, with a smile, 
 " and, mark us, Halis," he added, turning to the captain 
 of janissaries, " after the good service which this youth 
 hath this day rendered us, we cannot do less, we think, 
 than accord whatever boon, he may, peradventure, seek 
 in this little memorial, for such I take the paper to be, 
 and, by the head of the sultan ! I herewith v.ow, provided 
 his request be within our competence, to grant it -par 
 avance, — yea, though he ask us to gift him, with every 
 acre of territory, the victory of Mohacs subjected to our 
 dominion." Even as these last words fell from his thin 
 lips, Solyman (for we shall henceforth drop his nom-de- 
 guerre of Abu Obeida), unfolded the letter, and imme- 
 diately proceeded to acquaint himself with its contents. 
 Slowly his eye passed to and fro across the paper, with 
 an air of languid curiosity, which, as he read on, 
 deepened into positive interest ; he paused, and an in- 
 sensible change came over the sallow features of the 
 mighty emperor. His full dark orbs seemed to start from 
 out their sockets, as if to meet, half way, the incredible 
 information they were conveying to his mind. After 
 awhile, he withdrew his eyes from the paper, and fixed 
 them, with an earnest expression of surprise and interest 
 upon Sigismund, who rode on, a silent, but deeply inter- 
 ested observer of the sultan. Anon, he returned to the 
 consideration of the writing, which he read again, more 
 attentively. Presently, he re-intermitted his task, and, 
 crumbling the paper in his hand, as if in unconscious 
 nervousness, addressed himself to Sigismund — ** Sir 
 stranger," he abruptly asked, " where — where is he, 
 who entrusted you with this letter ? — the writer, I would 
 say ?" •

 MANUSCRIPT XXIII. 355 
 
 " I am myself the writer," replied Sigismund. 
 
 " How ?" ejaculated the sultan. 
 
 Sigismund bowed. 
 
 " Dost thou mean to tell me," cried Solyman, with a 
 gesture of impatience, '* that thou art the individual, 
 commonly called Count Rodna V 
 
 " I have that honour, my lord," said Sigismund. 
 
 Solyman regarded our hero attentively for more than 
 a minute's space, ere he again spoke, and then his words 
 dropped lowly, as if, uttered unconsciously, in answer to 
 his own thoughts. '* I make no doubt of it— I perceived, 
 from the first, his seeming was beneath his real station in 
 life — Allah Achbar ! — God is great !" Then, after a mi- 
 nute's pause, he continued, more audibly, " Have you 
 assurance of the truth of this matter, sir count ?" 
 he said; "ample, — sufficient, — proof that will defy 
 cavil; — evidence, — that the whole world must admit? 
 Have you such assurance, I ask, sir ?" 
 
 " It exists, and may be got at. Two points of evidence 
 only, are still amissing, which would prove irrefragable — 
 decisive ; and these, I trust, shortly to obtain," replied 
 Sigismund. 
 
 '' And what be they, sir?" demanded Solyman. 
 
 "The one is, the testimony of Peter Count Pereny, — 
 
 long supposed dead; the other ," Sigismund stopped 
 
 short. 
 
 ** Well, sir," repeated Solyman, " the other?" 
 
 " The crown of Hungary," said Sigismund. 
 
 *' What evidence were that?" cried Solyman in a dis- 
 dainful tone ; " methinks the crown of Hungary were 
 easily forthcoming, upon a lawful occasion." 
 
 "The evidence would be as a revelation from Heaven," 
 replied Sigismund, " but it is hard to come at." 
 
 " I comprehend not your meaning, either way," said 
 the sultan ; " but I have pledged myself, even to the ex- 
 tent of thy request ; and more, thou hast saved my life —

 and more — the man, whom I, ," the sultan stopped : 
 
 his eyes glistened and flared with a triumphant, but at 
 the same time, malevolent excitement, and there was a 
 significance, in the very bridling of his speech, which 
 might bear some similitude to the bitter and minatory 
 abruption of Neptune, in the immortal epic — "And 
 more," — he would have added, had he given voice to his 
 deliberate thoughts — " I shall hereby plant a thorn in 
 the side of the man, who, only last eve, insulted me in a 
 manner, never to be forgotten, or forgiven — and nicely 
 accord the mode of my revenge, to the nature of its pro- 
 vocation." Solyman presently resumed, " I ask you, 
 Count Rodna," he said, " as a man of honour, dost thou, 
 thyself, believe in the truth of that wonderful thing, 
 which thou hast herein affirmed V 
 
 " On my honour, I entertain not the shadow of a 
 doubt of its verity," replied Sigismund. 
 
 " Then your hand, brother," cried Solyman ; '' I 
 read all the assurance I require in thy voice, and con- 
 duct." 
 
 Sigismund extended his hand, and the sultan taking it 
 within his own, grasped it firmly. 
 
 " Now, by my sword and crown !" he exclaimed, " I 
 pledge myself to see you righted ; and, from this hour, 
 the whole resources of my empire shall be devoted to 
 that object." 
 
 " It will not come to such extremity, I hope," replied 
 Sigismund, with a smile, " though not the less I thank 
 you ; but, my lord, at the time I had the fortune to en- 
 counter you, I was journeying on a matter of life and 
 death. I have to entreat your permission now to pro- 
 ceed." 
 
 " We part soon, considering our acquaintance is not 
 an hour old, and that our friendship promises to be as 
 lasting, as our lives," said Solyman ; " but go thy ways, 
 brother — go thy ways, and good fortune go along with

 you." The sultan and Sigismund then interchanged 
 mutual obeisances, and the next minute our hero and 
 his attendant were seen outstripping the very wind, in 
 their eagerness to redeem the time, that Sigismund had 
 employed, in making himself known to Solyman the 
 Magnificent.

 Coui^T Ragotzy, after having outstripped the pursuit 
 of BanfFy's attendants, was not long- in arriving, at the 
 advanced outposts of the beleaguering army. He gave 
 himself up to the first party, which he fell in with, and 
 communicated his wish, to obtain instant access to the 
 Marquis of Piadena. 
 
 It was not until Ragotzy's repeated assurances of the 
 momentous nature of his tidings, and his positive refusal 
 to declare them to any person, excepting the general-in- 
 chief, that the officer in command was prevailed upon, to 
 undertake the somewhat thankless office of rousing the 
 marquis, and receiving his orders upon the matter. After 
 a short period of suspense, the pretended Jew was con- 
 ducted through the encampment, to a stately pavilion, 
 rising above the surrounding tents, in front of which the 
 standard of Austria rolled out its ample folds. In a few 
 minutes he was ushered into the interior, which was fitted 
 up with hangings of rich brocade, and decorated with 
 fluttering pennons. He perceived, that he stood in the 
 presence of the imperial chief, who, having hastily 
 thrown a loose robe around his person, was now sitting 
 on the side of his military couch.

 Baptista Castaldo was one of the most redoubted cap- 
 tains, that Europe at that time possessed. He had been 
 educated in the school of the celebrated Pescara, and, 
 " if more be wanting to his fame," says the historian, " it 
 may be added, that he enjoyed the friendship, though he 
 hardly merited the praise, of the man, ' sans peur et sans 
 reproche.'" At the time of his invasion of Transylvania, 
 he was in the meridian of his age, and of his reputation. 
 His carriage was conspicuously military, and his classi- 
 cally-chiselled features, too, prononcee to be otherwise 
 handsome, were military also. 
 
 " Israelite," commenced the chief, " I can tell thee thou 
 hadst best have good warranty for breaking my slumbers 
 at this deep hour. What hast to say to me ?" 
 
 Ragotzy cast an expressive glance towards the attend- 
 ants, who waited at the entrance of the pavilion. 
 
 *' Retire, sirs, and remain within call," said the mar- 
 quis ; " and now," he continued, when the men-at-arms 
 had withdrawn, " what is this business ? What costly gem, 
 rich shawl, or necklace of pearl, hast to dispose of ?" 
 
 Ragotzy made no immediate reply, but throwing aside 
 his outward disguise, stood before the marquis in his 
 brigand costume. 
 
 " Ha! Alaric Polgar !" exclaimed Castaldo. 
 
 " Right, minister of Ferdinand," replied the Cygani 
 leader; "ere now I have humbly contributed to your 
 lordship's ends. I have come to proffer my further 
 aid." 
 
 ''After what fashion, sir?" demanded Castaldo, with 
 some coolness. 
 
 " In the old mode, an' it please your lordship," ob- 
 served the leader, with a meaning smile. 
 
 " I can dispense with your services, sir — no more need 
 be said ;" answered Castaldo. 
 
 " Nay, my lord," said Ragotzy, " you have gained 
 some years' experience since we last met ; and years, they 
 say, bring wisdom ; but my little knowledge of human

 nature makes me doubt, whether, if life were lengthened 
 out to the span of the Hebrew of old, any single earnest 
 passion of the heart could become quite extinct, and 
 least of all revenge.'' 
 
 *' Revenge !" repeated Castaldo ; '' the word knells 
 upon my memory, as of some unquiet dream. But now, 
 sir," he continued, laying his hand on his heart, '' all is 
 at peace here, hushed as the still grave — " 
 
 " You thought you'd dug for him,'" said Ragotzy, with 
 quickness. " Ay, I understand ; but have you never 
 heard speak of uncharnelled forms walking the upper 
 world ? What, if your victim rose ?" 
 
 " I comprehend you not, but say on," answered Cas- 
 taldo. 
 
 '' When first I knew your lordship in Vienna," said 
 the Cygani, " I was a very bey, only gifted, perhaps, 
 with more than a boy's shrewdness ; I guessed, that from 
 the moment the exile aspired to the hand of the sister of 
 the emperor, he acquired your hatred. Queen Mary 
 was the fair object of your ambition, but he proffered 
 himself; and, I need not add, that, under certain stipu- 
 lations, the hand of the widow of king Lewis of Hun- 
 gary, was promised him for a guerdon." 
 
 " This can answer no end," said Castaldo, haughtily ; 
 " we had best terminate our interview." 
 
 " By your leave, I would subjoin a few brief syllables," 
 said Ragotzy. 
 
 " See they be brief, then," returned Castaldo ; '' nor 
 trust too far to our indulgence." 
 
 " There was another lady," resumed Ragotzy. 
 
 '^ I'll hear no more," broke in Castaldo, with some 
 heat. "Depart, sir, as you came." 
 
 " She was the fair object of your love,'' proceeded 
 Ragotzy, without regarding the frowns of the marquis. 
 She, the daughter of Jerome Lascus, proved your adder — 
 cut your heart in twain — and married him — the exile." 
 
 *' What is all this?" cried Castaldo; and his eyes

 flashed fire as he spoke. *' Are you awearied of your 
 life? Damnation ! Sirrah, curb your insolence." 
 
 " Hushed as is the grave !" said Ragotzy, with a sneer. 
 ** The dead can rise, you see." 
 
 ** Another word, and I'll call for whips — fetters. 
 Slave ! I'll have thee hanged on the highest tree within 
 our lines," cried the exasperated marquis. 
 
 ''You had better not, my lord," retorted Ragotzy, 
 *^ lest I proclaim the story to the whole camp." 
 
 " Incomparable scoundrel !" cried Piadena, making 
 an involuntary movement of his hand towards his sword, 
 which lay in the scabbard beside him. 
 
 *' I am armed, too," said Ragotzy, composedly; and 
 loosening in its leathern sheath the weapon, which he had 
 abstracted from the belt of BanfFy. *' But hear me to 
 the end, your excellency, and you may thank me for my 
 communication." 
 
 Castaldo preserved his countenance of stern indig- 
 nation, but made no reply. 
 
 " Well, my lord," proceeded Ragotzy; ''Thus doubly 
 rivalled in love and in policy, and defeated alike in both, 
 you so inflamed the rage of Charles and Ferdinand, 
 against the vacillating exile, for the dishonour put upon 
 their imperial house, by his marriage with Lascus' daugh- 
 ter, at the very time, he stood engaged to their sister, 
 that they threw him into bondage; and on his escape 
 from thence, they consented to disseminate those seeds of 
 
 murder, which , no, never shall I forget the glow of 
 
 exultation, with which you placed the proclamation in 
 my hands, and bade me put it into execution. * Alaric,' 
 you said, ' faithful Alaric, — noble leader !' — spending such 
 politic breath, that the air grew rank with your cozenage, 
 but I smiled the while, and taking the document, pledged 
 myself, to leave no stone unturned, till I had compassed 
 the reward." 
 
 " And yet, for all your fine promises, he breathed liis 
 last in his bed," observed Castaldo, scornfully.

 '' So it was given out,'' said Ragotzy. 
 
 " Given out," repeated Castaldo; " what boots it, 
 ripping up the graves of dead men ? Pshaw! Pereny died 
 in his bed, I say, years ago." Ragotzy made no reply, 
 but gave Castaldo a look, which spoke volumes. — 
 " What, did he not? in Styria? was't not of a pesti- 
 lence ?" demanded Castaldo, with wild earnestness. 
 
 " My lord, he lives," said Ragotzy. 
 
 " Lives! Peter Pereny lives! You lie, scoundrel! it 
 cannot be. And I live to hear it !" exclaimed the mar- 
 quis. He rose from the low couch, and rapidly paced 
 the narrow space of the thickly carpeted pavilion. His 
 countenance grew livid, and assumed a perfectly diabo- 
 lical expression, — his teeth set, and his eyes started from 
 their sockets. "■ Alive!" he proceeded, in a voice of 
 thunder, rather accelerating his pace than otherwise, as 
 he spoke; — ''And free! — where?" He stopped as he 
 was passing the brigand, and repeated, — "Where, I 
 say ?" With these words, the marquis leant his face so 
 forward, that it almost touched that of the Cygani. 
 
 " In Hermanstadt," replied Ragotzy. Castaldo re- 
 coiled. " I saw him within these last few days. More, 
 I spoke with him." 
 
 "You spoke with him? in his proper person?" said 
 Castaldo. 
 
 " Why no, verily," replied Ragotzy, with a laugh ; 
 " the mighty magnat was so altered in his outward man, 
 that tlie daughter of the palatine of Seradia herself would 
 not have recognised him. "He is grown familiar to a 
 certain Father Dominick, you may have heard tell of." 
 
 " In Hermanstadt?" reiterated Castaldo. 
 
 "^ In Hermanstadt, my lord." 
 
 " He there living, and thou here to tell me ? No — no — 
 no. Why, the proclamation hath never been recalled; 
 the gold is forthcoming, — and thy dagger " 
 
 " Is at your lordship's service," broke in Ragotzy; 
 " if you can make your assertions appear."

 MANUSCRIPT XXIV. 363 
 
 *' Of course, I can," said Castaldo ; ** what do you 
 mean?" 
 
 " You will bear in mind, my lord," said Ragotzy ; 
 *' that when those proclamations were first put forth, 
 you were the confidential minister of the archduke ; and 
 even then, with difficulty, you prevailed on the imperial 
 brothers, to yield so far to your simulated zeal for their 
 honour, as to suffer the circulation of those bloody in- 
 struments. Since those days, what changes have not 
 taken place in the aspect of the world! Queen Mary 
 is no longer the injured, and the forsaken, but reigns the 
 governess of the Low Countries. Her favoured rival, is 
 pale and marrowless, — whose bridal sheets are turned to 
 winding ones; and whose once envied couch is the cold 
 tomb." Castaldo groaned. — " Pereny has now been so 
 long reputed dead, that if his resurrection resuscitate 
 bitter memories, it will be without their sting. And you 
 yourself, what influence can you have ? Think you, my 
 lord, that what you found so hard to prevail upon the 
 emperor to authorize, in times of trust and favour, you 
 would have now the remotest chance of accomplishing." 
 Castaldo turned fiercely from the Cygani, and traversed 
 the tent as before,. '' You," continued Count Ragotzy, 
 " flying to Vienna in disgrace; an ambassador, foiled in 
 diplomacy, — a captain worsted in pitched battle ; of all 
 the hoarded reputation you brought with you against 
 our seven cities* not a particle remaining, of all the army 
 entrusted to your command ; yourself, perchance, the 
 only living herald of its utter destruction ! No, Marquis 
 of Piadena, I would not act on the royal warrant, you 
 spake of, which the lapse of time, and circumstances, 
 have long annulled." 
 
 Castaldo stopped short his walk, and turned paler 
 than before. " Merciful Heaven !" he cried, " what 
 riddle is this you hint at? Since thou hast sketched my 
 
 * Transylvania ; so designated of old.

 destiny on the wall, perchance thou canst read the 
 writing." 
 
 "In flame, my lord, and blood," returned Ragotzy, 
 solemnly, " I can, — hearken then;" and resuming his 
 earnest attitude, he proceeded without further preface, 
 briefly to unfold to the electrified marquis, the critical si- 
 tuation of his army; and as a confirmation of his intelli- 
 gence, extended towards Castaldo, the open letter of 
 Quendi Ferens. 
 
 The marquis eagerly seized the paper, and as his eye 
 passed hastily over its contents, his anxious counten- 
 ance rapidly deepened, into an expression of positive an- 
 guish. The paper fell from the chieftain's hold, and with 
 distended visage, stretched palms, lips wide apart, and 
 each particular hair on end, 
 
 " Like quills upon the fretful pore n pine," 
 
 Piadena stood, like a man paralyzed. He had re- 
 ceived despatches from Antoine Ferraro, only the day 
 before, and from the tenor of his secretary's commu- 
 nication, had been lulled into the most complete se- 
 curity. Having never learned the full extent of Mar- 
 tinuzzi's preparations, he felt persuaded, that the regent, 
 with the throne in prospect, would necessarily remain an 
 inactive spectator of the siege of Coloswar. If the mar- 
 quis could have dived into the heart of the man, he hoped 
 to cajole or to intimidate, he must have been aware of 
 the hostile intentions of Martinuzzi, and might perhaps 
 have anticipated the circumstance of his rapid march, in 
 which case, the imperial outposts and the advanced 
 guard of the r^ent would have come into contact, 
 before the difficult passage of the Samos had been 
 effected. As it was, but for one of those unlooked-for 
 chances, which sometimes, in war, disappoint the finest 
 calculations, the imperialists must have been totally 
 annihilated, by the combined armies of Turkey and Tran- 
 sylvania. The idea of his having been circumvented by

 Martinuzzi, with all the attendant consequences of ruin 
 and loss of reputation, now darted through the brain of 
 the marquis, seeming to whirl his sense in a most horrid vor- 
 tex. But in this state he was not long suffered to continue. 
 
 " Recover your senses, my lord," said Ragotzy, *' and 
 tell me, will he not merit mighty things, who shall ex- 
 tricate you from your perilous situation ?" 
 
 " Who can deliver me ?" said Castaldo, in the accents 
 of despair. 
 
 '' Certainly not standing there inactive ; but, I both 
 can, and will," replied Ragotzy ; *' if you make it worth 
 my while." 
 
 " Explain yourself farther," said Castaldo. 
 
 " First, my lord, issue orders, that your army be 
 drawn out to receive the enemy : you may look for 
 Quendi Ferens' assault, every moment." 
 
 ''Right," said the marquis: "I will just say three 
 words to Count Salm, and be back instantly." 
 
 *' Mind, my lord, I wait not any man's pleasure, for 
 long," said Ragotzy, as Castaldo left the tent. 
 
 After a short time, the rolling of the warning drums, 
 disturbed the deep stillness of the hour, and the slumber 
 of the camp was broken. 
 
 When the marquis re-entered, he appeared more com- 
 posed. *' Now, Alaric Polgar," he said ; " in what way 
 can you bring your services, to bear upon this strait of 
 ours?" 
 
 ** You are already answered, in part, by my giving 
 you this timely warning," replied Ragotzy : and then he 
 proceeded to reveal to Castaldo, the conspiracy of the 
 Hungarian magnats, which not only included a sure exe- 
 cution of their own vengeance, but afforded, to the 
 Austrian general, fresh hopes of victory. *' WJiat is 
 more than this," concluded the Cygani ; " I myself 
 know a spell, to retard the advance of Achamates, till 
 after the event : when, if victorious, you can easily elude 
 his powers. This will I effect, besides bringing to your

 aid my small and determined band, if you, to save your- 
 self, in your present exigence, please to subscribe our 
 terms." 
 
 " Please you to state them, sir," said Castaldo. 
 
 "They are nearly the same, as were granted to Peter 
 Pereny, when an emigrant in Vienna," answered Ra- 
 gotzy ; " namely, that Transylvania, and the adjoining 
 bannats, be considered as a fief of Austria." * 
 
 " And whom, sir, would you put in the place of that 
 person, who, by his intended marriage with the relict of 
 King Lewis, might, perhaps, have had some pretension 
 to the honour of reigning over this realm?" 
 
 '' Him, who now purposeth to unite himself to the 
 rightful heiress of the throne," returned Ragotzy. 
 
 "By the rightful heiress, you must mean the late 
 King John's daughter, — " said Castaldo, " purposeth 
 to unite himself! The lady's guardian, I suspect, will 
 spoil him for a bridegroom ; — but what's he, who, as the 
 feudatory of Ferdinand, looks to be king in Tran- 
 sylvania ? " 
 
 " Behold him in me !" replied the brigand. 
 
 " Ah !" ejaculated the marquis. 
 
 " The conjuror, who can work such miracles for Aus- 
 tria," rejoined Ragotzy, "as to save your army in its 
 present emergency, deserves no meaner requital ; espe- 
 cially since 'tis a matter of indifference, to that individual, 
 whether he mount the throne, with Ferdinand's con- 
 sent, or in spite of that potentate, and as a consequence 
 of his general's defeat." 
 
 The amazement of Castaldo, was too great for ex- 
 pression, and, for some moments, he stood gazing in the 
 face of the brigand, in pure wonderment. At last he

 found words. ''Is it possible that you speak of your- 
 self, sir?" he demanded. 
 
 "Most certain," said Ragotzy ; " but time presses for 
 both ; — your decision, my lord V 
 
 " How can I be sure," said the politic marquis, eva- 
 sively, and after a long pause, " that I am in the predi- 
 cament you state ? — that an attack is impending, from 
 Martiniizzi ? — that these conspiring nobles will take 
 part with me ? — that the Turk is in my rear ? What 
 have you to offer, in evidence of such incredible mar- 
 vels?" 
 
 " The event!'' said Ragotzy ; '' the most minute seg- 
 ment of the cycle of your lordship's life, will witness for 
 me. I, however, do not choose to dally away in talk, 
 that teeming evolution. Am I to reckon on Austria's 
 favourable countenance, in case I ever win Hungaria's 
 queen, and come to wear Hungaria's coronet ? I ask no 
 aid, — neutrality is all I demand, in return for my grati- 
 fying at once, in an eminent degree, both your resent- 
 menc, and your ambition." 
 
 " My resentment ?" exclaimed Castaldo. 
 
 '' Ay," said Ragotzy ; " I will undertake, that the 
 man you love so dearly, or that counterfeit African, for 
 they are one and the same, shall cease to walk the vaults 
 of Hermanstadt, or breathe the upper air, if his removal 
 will incline you to favour my views." 
 
 *' What, will you so ?" cried Castaldo eagerly. 
 
 ''Ay, verily," said Ragotzy; " only render me a me- 
 morandum, in your capacity of representative of Aus- 
 tria, of your recognition of the future husband of the 
 heiress of Hungary, for king of this realm ; and by the 
 Lord who made him ! Peter Pereny dies, ere this day 
 se'ennight, if so my own life reach that term." 
 
 Castaldo pondered deeply for a moment, pacing up 
 and down the apartment. He paused. "These Hun- 
 garian chiefs will fight to-day, on the side of Austria ?'* 
 he said.

 " To some purpose, or I much mistake," replied 
 Ragotzy. 
 
 The marquis resumed his walk. " You promise you 
 can, and will, suspend the advance of the basha ?" he 
 presently continued, again stopping short. 
 
 " You may rely on the Ottoman remaining stationary ; 
 since I guess," he added, " such to be his policy ; 
 though he'd hardly ask my concurrence, if he pur- 
 posed otherwise." 
 
 This was uttered softo voce. Castaldo's ear caught 
 not the words. For the third time he made a halt, di- 
 rectly in front of Ragotzy. 
 
 " Valiant leader," he said, with a tone of deep and 
 serious emphasis ; '^ that matter of the death of Pe- 
 reny, stands a part of our covenant; — thou art ready 
 to serve me therein ?" 
 
 "Oh, of course — of course!" returned his companion. 
 
 " Alaric Polgar," said Castaldo ; " you shall have the 
 memorandum you require ;" and taking some paper 
 from a small portefeuile, that lay convenient, the marquis 
 proceeded to scratch the necessary instrument. Abruptly 
 he raised his head. " I had best designate her highness 
 by name ?" he observed. 
 
 " No, no," responded Ragotzy, " the heiress of Hun- 
 gary will suffice, — what matters for a name ?" 
 
 "What matters, indeed!" said Castaldo internally; 
 " Ferdinand meant to bestow that painted baby, Cze- 
 rina, on his victorious general ; but true policy is pliant 
 as wax, and changes its form, and features, according 
 to circumstances." 
 
 Having, by this time, hastily traced one or two lines, 
 the important writing was delivered into the hands of 
 Ragotzy, who prepared to depart. 
 
 " Pereny dies?" interrogated Castaldo, solemnly, 
 drawing very near to his associate, and lowering his 
 voice, almost to a whisper. 
 
 '^ Pereny dies !" replied the Cygani leader more au-

 dibly, and accompanying the affirmation with most sig- 
 nificant gesture. He said, and quitted the tent. 
 
 Having got beyond the Austrian lines, he darted over 
 hill and dale, at such a round pace, as soon brought him 
 to the troglodyte hold of his formidable band. He let 
 himself down, through the same yawning crevice of the 
 earth, by which he introduced Vicchy to his rifted ter- 
 ritory, as related in an earlier manuscript. Within the 
 cave, all was pitchy dark. The brigand passed on, with 
 unpausing step, through this gloomy vestibule of his sub- 
 terranean habitation, saying to himself, ''How is this? 
 No order — no observance — no outpost ! Now, what the 
 foul fiend I imports this negligence ? " 
 
 He entered a smaller chamber; — all there was still: 
 he turned away, and directed his hurried steps, along a 
 winding passage, leading to the dormitory of his men. 
 He had proceeded but a few paces, when the sound of a 
 human voice, deep and hollow, suddenly knelled on 
 his ear. 
 
 '' Alaric, come hither," it said. 
 
 He diverged into a deep recess. No ray of light, 
 found its way to this " obscure sojourn," — the dank, 
 palpable atmosphere was black as ink. He stood in the 
 midst. 
 
 "Forbear!" said the voice; ''go not to witness a 
 sight, that will drive you frantic with amaze ; remain in 
 ignorance, till to-morrow." 
 
 " Mother, what hath chanced?" said Ragotzy : "Why 
 do I find you here ? Why alone, and in darkness ? 
 
 " In this chamber," answered Unna, "during many 
 hours, have I lain in wait, against your return, to save 
 your eyes a prospect, more blinding than the utter gloom, 
 that shrouds the spot where we stand." 
 
 "Ha! what am I to augur from your words ?" said 
 Ragotzy ; " All so still — no watch — no movement — is 
 this cavern evacuated ? Is the band of Alaric Polgar 
 fled?"

 "One man only, of all your troop is absent," replied 
 Unna ; " the rest lie lapped under their sparry roof, — 
 in sleep." 
 
 ''The rascals!" cried Ragotzy ; ''I will but rouse 
 them, and return." 
 
 " Nay, stay, Alaric," cried Unna earnestly. 
 
 " I cannot loiter," said the leader ; "■ I have work to 
 put them to, and every minute is precious." 
 
 '' Yet go not hence, till you hear." 
 
 " I will be back, I tell you," answered the brigand 
 impatiently. 
 
 "■ Leave me not, I implore you," shrieked Unna ; '* 'tis 
 to no end ; your men are " 
 
 ''What?" eagerly demanded Ragotzy. "Why do 
 you stop short ? Nay, if you will not answer, let me go 
 myself, and witness with my own eyes." 
 
 "A sight to blast them!" said Unna. " Away then, 
 but be prepared for horrors dire, and of unheard of 
 moment. Go ! and return." 
 
 Ragotzy rushed out of the cell, and the next instant, 
 passed into the common sleeping-room. It was a lofty, 
 and a spacious chamber, dimly lighted up by a cresset, 
 that hung suspended from the roof. The whole band 
 lay stretched in their ordinary dress, upon the floor ; and 
 for a few seconds, Ragotzy could discern nothing, that 
 might tend to explain the dismal, and uncertain intima- 
 tion of evil, with which his mother had deemed it expe- 
 dient to forewarn his soul. The low, nasal, and inhar- 
 monious chorus, proper to the hour and the apartment, 
 pervaded the dormitory, and Ragotzy was about to scare 
 them from their slumber, by the thunder of his voice, 
 when a ghastly and multitudinous spectacle, pierced his 
 sight; — he stood transfixed, for at his feet was spread a 
 tumulose heap of gory human hands. He gasped for 
 breath, as his eye ranged distractedly, from the pile of 
 amputated members, to the dreaming forms of his bandit 
 followers; — and who can judge the emotions of the

 leader, at beholding the maimed right arm, of one and 
 all of the sleepers, terminate in a bandaged stump ?* The 
 yell he set up was infernal, and it reverberated through 
 the vaults, like the agonized expression of a fiend. Loud, 
 however, as it was discordant, it failed to startle, from 
 his heavy trance, a single individual, of all that crip- 
 pled banditti ; and, but for their troubled breathing, it 
 would have seemed, that only the summoning trump, at 
 the last day, would rouse them from so deep and unna- 
 tural a slumber. For another instant, Ragotzy bore to 
 gaze around him, and then rushed, like one possessed, 
 from the fatal chamber, to that dark recess, where he 
 had left his mother, Unna. Neither spoke, for some 
 minutes. 
 
 " I have looked upon the bloody vision," said Ra- 
 gotzy, at length, with forced calmness, from between his 
 clenched teeth, — '' I have looked, — I have gazed my 
 fill, — and I come for explanation. Whosoever com- 
 passed this deed, is he liable, think you, to human modes 
 of vengeance ? — has he hands himself, feet, head, heart ? 
 Can he be reached, tortured, — tortured like me, — and 
 racked to atomies? — Has he," proceeded the maddened 
 leader, and his constrained enunciation heightened into 
 a harsh scream, — " has he flesh and blood? Oh, tell 
 me, only tell me, he is of mortal mould ?" 
 
 *' He is," answered Unna, '' and vulnerable, most 
 vulnerable." 
 
 '* Well, well," said Ragotzy, with gasping breath, 
 '' and his name, good mother ? Oh, be speedy ! give 
 me something to curse.'' 
 
 '* Your late prisoner; he 1 bade you so emphatically 
 hold in secure durance ; — he, you weakly let escape 
 you." 
 
 *' The lunatic?" cried Ragotzy, in the deep guttural 
 tones of irrepressible amazement, — '* was't he did it?" 
 
 * Founded on a fact of the times in Transylvania.

 '* The lunatic !" repeated Unna, mockingly ; — '* tush, 
 son ! he you call so, is as sane, as formidable." 
 
 "Formidable!" echoed Ragotzy ; "would he were, 
 to meet the might of vengeance ! — but how know you 
 it was he?" 
 
 " He was the primal cause," said Unna ; " his agent 
 and confederate in the horrid act, was one of your own 
 men, named Walter. I met the slave without the cave, 
 as he came reeking from the slaughter ; — he dared boast 
 to me, how he had first drugged, and then maimed his 
 comrades." 
 
 " Did the infernal traitor assign a motive?" demanded 
 Ragotzy. 
 
 " He did; — that, the other day, you felled him in 
 your heat, that youth being by. You quitted the spot 
 instantly, when he, Sigismund. politicly raised the false 
 knave from the earth, and offered him a command in the 
 troop of Iwan, if he would renounce the profession of a 
 bandit. His weighty promises struck, nicely-timed, on 
 the heated soul of Walter ; to that sudden league, you 
 owe this massacre, and more, — the escape of Sigismund 
 and Veronica. To him — to Sigismund — the daughter 
 of Vicchy whispered, how Alaric Polgar killed his reputed 
 grandsire, for, by some means, that night she penetrated 
 your disguisement." 
 
 The bandit grasped the hilt of his dagger, and gnashed 
 his teeth in fury. " Death ! and hell ! and " 
 
 "Nay, hear further," interrupted Unna; "Walter 
 told me, in mocking defiance, he overheard all this ; and 
 added somewhat, that I will not mention, of the youth's 
 vows of vengeance ; moreover he, the traitor, jeeringly 
 bade me tell my son, how he well knew, from their fre- 
 quent colloquies, that Count Rodna would shortly obtain 
 the lady's hand, and ^/m^, without dragging her, a re- 
 luctant victim, to the altar. Had I had a weapon, Alaric, 
 I would have answered him ; but, unarmed, I was fain to 
 endure the insulter's taunts, in silence."

 " Hell ! it is ! — I'll clutch him yet ; — but helJ it is," 
 cried Ragotzy, *' to think the wretch can die but once !" 
 He paused, and his hands clenched, and unclenched, with 
 nervous irritation. *' How said you ?" he presently re- 
 sumed, — '* Sigismund wed the heiress of Baron Wal- 
 stein, mother! An exquisite bed-fellow, i' faith, he'll 
 find her, or I err ; — 'tis a shrewd wench /" and the bri- 
 gand laughed bitterly. *' But no more of that — the 
 match must be prevented ; — the crown of Hungary is 
 at stake !" 
 
 " The crown of Hungary !" echoed Unna, with an 
 ineffable scornfulness of accent. 
 
 " Ay, mother, is it not ?" cried Ragotzy, almost breath- 
 less. 
 
 '* Alaric ! Alaric !" returned his mother, in a most 
 deep and solemn tone of voice, "that Sigismund hath 
 no need to wed the daughter of Vicchy, to compass the 
 
 crown of Hungary, he being himself the son of- ; but, 
 
 lest the tell-tale air catch the sound, hark to an un- 
 matched secret in thine ear," — she whispered. 
 
 The brigand started back. " Now, by my soul !" he 
 exclaimed, as the truth began to dawn upon him, " I 
 feel a stern gladness stirring within me, — the youth wil 
 prove no ignoble sacrifice. Formerly, from being so 
 much with Peter, Count Pereny, at Count Rodna's, I 
 deemed him his son by Lascus's daughter, and, as such, 
 agreeably to the imperial will, would have cut him ofT 
 with his father, on that night, you wot off; but doth lie 
 know as much ?" 
 
 '■I doubt it not," said Unna; '^ Luke Swartz hath 
 assuredly acquainted him with his origin. And that re- 
 minds me, I have an account to settle with that false 
 keeper. 1 have him safe, and, may this right hand fail 
 me, an' he be not safer this night ! Do you purpose 
 joining the battle, that to-day impendeth." 
 
 '' I did, to the regent's ruin, — but that is over now," 
 said Ragotzy.

 " Mark me, Alaric ! if you ever touch but a hair of 
 that man's head, woe! woel temporal and eternal woe 
 be on thee !" 
 
 " I will not stay to hear thee," said Ragotzy, — " I 
 must arm me for vengeance. Sigismund may be in the 
 fight." 
 
 " For him," said Unna, *' spare him not; but Mar- 
 tinuzzis "person is sacred. Will you visit, to-morrow, the 
 village of Mount Hielen ? — I would speak further with 
 you touching these matters. Shall I await you there ?" 
 
 " You may," said Ragotzy. 
 
 " For certain ?" demanded Unna. 
 
 '^ As sure as that I breathe." 
 
 '• Farewell, then, my dear son !" 
 
 " Farewell, dear mother !" 
 
 They parted. Oh ! how sweet, how ineffably sweet, 
 is the affection of such close connection ! and, even in 
 the depths of the hardest heart, how triumphant doth it 
 rise over the consciousness of crime ! The sins of Unna 
 were mighty, and, we believe, we have somewhere said, 
 that those of Ragotzy were without redemption, — per-

 The birth of George Martinuzzi occurred, it is sup- 
 posed, in Croatia,* somewhere about the latter part of the 
 fifteenth century, and proved the advent of as fatal 
 calamities to his adopted country, as ever overwhelmed 
 the liberties of a gallant people. It is true that the con- 
 sequences of the fall of Presburg had been quickly re- 
 trieved by a peace with the Archduke Ferdinand, and 
 that any imaginary disgrace might be considered as ob- 
 literated in the brilliant affair, which happened shortly

 after, of two thousand cattle-keepers putting to route 
 the whole infidel force in the gorge of the Red Tower.* 
 But Rhodes, which had long held the Ottoman emperor 
 at bay, having at length submitted to his arms,t his 
 mind had leisure to revert to his ancient and fascinated 
 enemy. He fixed his basiliskan eye on the Magyar 
 nation, as on a prey. For awhile he seemed to hesitate ; 
 but a slight affront, which, in an evil hour, his represen- 
 tative received at the court of Lewis, t though promptly 
 avenged by the massacre of 20,000 prisoners, served as 
 an apology and signal for the memorable irruption of 
 1526. Ere that event, however ominous the clouds 
 which frequently darkened the eastern hemisphere of 
 Europe, they invariably gathered without bursting. 
 Hungary, during this temporary interval of breathing- 
 time, seems to have been lulled into a false and fatal 
 supineness, and to have taken no rational measures of 
 defence, in the event of a renewed invasion. Solyman, 
 who, according to Istuanfius, was looked upon at this 
 period as another Sardanapalus, lingered in his capital, 
 occupied in consolidating his conquests and resources, 
 and recruiting the strength of his vast empire, as Jove's 
 bird might retire to his impregnable aerie, and new 
 plume his wing, for a flight more soaring than the last. 
 
 At length, the blow, so long suspended, fell with re- 
 doubled weight. In the summer of the year already ad- 
 verted to, 250,000 Ottomans turned the flank of Transyl- 
 vania, and rushed like a torrent down upon the sandy 
 steppes of Lower Hungary. The bulwark of Christendom^ 
 had already been taken by assault. To oppose the inroad

 of this destroying host, Lewis took the field in person ; 
 and ambitious to distinguish his reign by a splendid 
 achievement, he fatally resolved to stand the shock at 
 the head of very inferior forces. '' Green in his estate,"* 
 the royal stripling v^as accustomed to defer, as a matter 
 of course, to the advice of priestly counsellors. It was 
 an hereditary failing. Not long before, his predecessor, 
 Ladislas, had yielded to the fanaticism of the Archbishop 
 of Strigonie, whilst that prelate inflamed the minds of 
 the deluded peasantry to a degree of religious enthu- 
 siasm, which, although in the first instance directed 
 against the Turks, came to wreak itself indiscriminately 
 on Mahometan and Christian. f This phrenetic fire was 
 with difficulty extinguished by a sanguinary victory, 
 gained over the wTetched crusaders at Temeswar, by 
 John of Zapola, hereditary w^aivode of Transylvania. * 
 Unadmonished by his father's error, Lewis, as super- 
 stitious as he was brave, had blindly committed his con- 
 duct to the guidance of ecclesiastics. Several prelates 
 received military appointments, § and a friar of the order 
 of St. Francis precipitated the fate of Hungary. Paul 
 Tomorry, Archbishop of Colocza, took the lead of the 
 palatine Etienne Bathori,|| to whose office of customary

 dies ircc, King Lewis was admonished by a terrible 
 phantom, (^^ Un fantome hideux, decharne, les yeux 
 nrdens, lesjambes torses'') not to quit his advantageous 
 position, but to await the junction of John of Zapola, 
 who was advancing by rapid marches from Transylvania, 
 with a considerable reinforcement. The brave monarch, 
 liowever, influenced by the counsel of Tomorry, and 
 eager to strike a brilliant and decided blow, before the 
 diligence of the waivode could pretend to share the ho- 
 nour and participate in the triumph, disdained the salu- 
 tary and supernatural warning. In the ardour and in- 
 experience of youth, and actuated by the pride of prow- 
 ess, and the impatience of inaction, he felt persuaded 
 that every obstacle must yield to the invincible virtue of

 of the public calamity. The butchery did not cease 
 for many following days. Buda was delivered up to pil-

 Hungarian mothers, fancying the howl of the wolf-dog 
 in the night portended the coming of the Turk, were 
 known, in their distraction, " to pluck their nipple from 
 the boneless gums of the babe that milked them," and 
 bury him alive, lest his shrill cries might betray their 
 lurking place. It appears manifestly from every account, 
 that the whole of Hungary lay prostrate at the foot of 
 the victor. Her claims and liberties — her constitution 
 and prosperity — were alike trodden down ; and from that 
 day to the present, she might have been swallowed up in 
 the Ottoman empire, had Solyman not found himself 
 shortly constrained, by the necessity of his affairs, to 
 withdraw his forces into Asia, in order to crush the re- 
 bellion of the Caramanian princes. 
 
 These historical occurrences, which we have necessa- 
 rily glanced over more cursorily in this preliminary chap- 
 ter than we might have done were ours a loftier avocation 
 engrossed the attention of all men, and account, in a 
 great measure, for the obscurity which involves the 
 family and earlier years of Martinuzzi. What was over- 
 looked amidst incidents more immediately interesting, 
 could hardly be retraced years subsequently, especially 
 since Martinuzzi, after his destinies had called him to 
 so high an elevation, invariably eschewed any allusion to 
 his origin. We have only, therefore, to choose between 
 the contradictions of his chroniclers. The biography of 
 M. Bechet, canon of Usez,* (though chiefly compiled 
 from Thuanus and Istuanfius), seems to us least obnox- 
 ious to cavil, and we shall consequently take leave to 
 adhere, in a great measure, to his authority, in the con- 
 cise preliminary account of Martinuzzi, which we think 
 requisite to lay before our readers. 
 
 The personage, the interesting scene of whose fortunes 
 we have undertaken to exhibit, was consigned, by the

 bishop Sigismimd of FUnfkirclien, to the prelection of 
 J. Corvinus, natural son of King Mathias; and his child- 
 hood was spent in the castle of Hunniade, in Transyl- 
 vania. Afterwards, together with his sister, he came 
 to reside under the roof of the Grafne, or Countess 
 Scepas, mother of John of Zapola. The children were 
 recommended to her service by the same prelate of FUnf- 
 kirclien, who introduced them as the offspring of one 
 Gregory Uthysenitsch, whom he represented to be the des- 
 cendant of an illustrious family, plunged by the civil cala- 
 mities of the period in ruin. Further explanation the 
 bishop declined affording, and it seems to have been the 
 impression of the countess, that in fostering the little 
 George Martinuzzi, she was solacing the paternal solici- 
 tude of her right reverend friend. 
 
 Be that as it may, George soon found himself at home; 
 his childish sports and those of his sister. Rose, were 
 shared by the youthful count, and the little Beatrice de 
 Zapola. Indeed, over the former (although several years 
 his senior) our foundling presently gained such an as- 
 cendant, as only ceased long afterwards with the life of 
 that personage. When George Martinuzzi had attained 
 the age of manhood, for some unexplained cause, he 
 quitted the residence of the young waivode, of Transyl- 
 vania, and retired to the monastery of the order of St. 
 Paul the hermit, at Ladium, near Erlau. Here, having 
 struggled into the knowledge of classical literature and 
 science, amid no ordinary impediments, he betook him- 
 self to the ecclesiastical life. Bishop Sigismund, of 
 Funfkirchen, his early benefactor, was now no more. On 
 the accession of John of Zapola, after the battle of Mo- 
 hacs, Martinuzzi declined accepting his pressing invita- 
 tion to come to Buda, but when, in the ensuing year, the 
 troubles of the kingdom were renewed, and the invasion 
 of the Archduke Ferdinand drove his beloved sovereign 
 into exile, the young priest deemed it his duty to leave 
 the sanctuary of the cloister, and followed his friend to Po-

 land, to proffer him his services. He found the king at 
 the house of Jerome Lascus,* afterwards Palatine of 
 Seradia, a man, to use the words of the historian, " for 
 his honourable descent and learned virtue of great fame 
 and reputation amongst the Polonians."t Martinuzzi 
 was welcomed with open arms by the expelled monarch ; 
 the more so, that he brought word that the regalia of St. 
 Stephen was yet at Vissegrade, and had not hitherto fallen 
 into the hands of his competitor. 
 
 The reader should understand that this was a relic of 
 antiquity, held in the most superstitious regard by every 
 true Hungarian, from its being devoutly believed to have 
 been fabricated by angels. It was the sacred gift of pope 
 Benedict the Fifth, t to Stephen the Holy, the first Chris- 
 tian possessed of the regal dignity in Hungary, from 
 which era it had been preserved with reverential awe, as a 
 deposit of inestimable w^orth. The regal rights and pri- 
 vileges were reputed to be inseparable from its possession. 
 In it is centered, remarks one historian, § " omnis religio, 
 salus, decusque Hungarorum. — Quis precor," he asks 
 elsewhere, " ambigere ausit sacrara coronam in tutela prse- 
 potentis Dei esse?" without its assistance there could be no 
 legitimate claim preferred to the sovereignty. "Quand bien 
 meme vous verriez la couronne de St. Etienne sur la tete 
 d'un Bceuf vous n'en devriez pas moins le reconnoitre 
 pour roi," was the celebrated saying of an Hungarian. ||

 The joy of the king at learning that the sacred regalia 
 had escaped the spoiler, may therefore easily be conceived. 
 Martinuzzi, in company with Lascus, was privately des- 
 patched as John's ambassador to Constantinople. 
 
 The interest of Solyman, and his hatred of the empire, 
 must have ably seconded, or even prevented the eloquence 
 of the holy father. It is certain, that, whether directly, 
 or through the medium of the Basha, he so forcibly im- 
 pressed upon the mind of the sultan, the impolicy of per- 
 mitting the archduke to press upon his dominions by the 
 acquisition of the Roman Dacia, that Solyman himself 
 proposed to crown John of Zapola, in Buda, if he would 
 consent to hold his sceptre as a fief of the Porte. It was 
 somewhat prior to this, that Ferdinand, in right of his 
 consort, and what was called at the time the family com- 
 pact, advanced his claim to the Hungarian crown; and 
 having, on the evacuation of the Turks, entered the coun- 
 try with an imperial army, he already was possessed of 
 the greater part of the kingdom. Martinuzzi had scarcely 
 taken his leave, when the ambassadors of Ferdinand are 
 ushered into the presence of the Ottoman emperor. They 
 rashly require of him the cession of the places he had 
 captured from king Lewis, as the price of the friendship 
 of the archduke. A haughty and bitter smile curled the 
 lip of Solyman for a moment. Then, rising indignantly, 
 he spake : memorable was his reply. " Say to him who sent 
 you," exclaimed the fierce sultan, " that you have beheld 
 my armies on the point of re-entering Hungary — the 
 keys of all my fortresses in that kingdom are here in my 
 hands, and I shall suspend them round my neck ;* thus 
 accoutred, I hie me in the first place to the plain of 
 Mohacs:t there bid your master await me if he have the 
 courage, and let arms again decide, on that plain, whether 
 this territory be his right, or that of king John, my feu-

 datory. Should I lie vanquished, he will find me amongst 
 the slain; when, by severing my head from off my shoul- 
 ders, the keys of Hungary will be in his grasp — but 
 mark me, sir, if we do not meet in Mohacs, tell your 
 master, I march on to Buda; if I light not on him in that 
 capital, 'tis in Vienna I shall seek him."* It is well 
 known how dreadfully Solyman kept this promise. In 
 the ensuing month, like an unhooded hawk, he flew at 
 his accustomed quarry, and re-seated John of Zapola in 
 triumph on the throne of Hungary. 
 
 Meantime, the sister of Martinuzzi had been united to 
 the graf, or count, Peter Pereny, and within a twelve- 
 month afterwards gave birth to a male infant (Maximilian) 
 whose being was dearly purchased by the death of his 
 maternal parent. Peter Pereny, who came to play so 
 conspicuous a part on the troubled stage of Hungary, 
 was descended of an illustrious house. 
 
 At the time that the throne became vacant, in conse- 
 quence of King Lewis having bit the dust, Pereny was in 
 possession of Vissegrade, and so, although only one of 
 the " Duumviri," held at his disposal the regal ornaments 
 of the kingdom,! which, by the prescription of centuries, 
 were deposited in the castle that overlooks that city.f 
 
 This nobleman was endowed with many of the qualities 
 which command respect. His magnificence bordered on 
 profusion; his courage was unacquainted with fear, and 
 his mind disdained subordination; but he appears to 
 have been governed throughout his life, chiefly by that 
 wavering impulse, which is apt to become the sole rudder 
 of minds, not nicely balanced by substantial principle. 
 There was, however, something grand in the uncom- 
 promising hauteur with which he invariably kept him-

 try, and reputation had been alike sacrificed. The 
 noble exile stood, like Hannibal, at the court of An- 
 tiochus, *' amongst them, but not of them," — his body 
 seemed to swell beyond the fetters of their conventional 
 alliance. Pereny knew not how to succumb even to 
 conquer. What could be a finer spectacle than the 
 generosity and magnificence displayed by the Hungarian 
 noble, in the days of his glory ; ere yet his character had 
 been tarnished, and his fortune at once assailed by ad- 
 versity, and broken in upon by ingratitude and dis- 
 appointment ?— the hundred tables daily groaning beneath

 dictions with which he was invested, might have wrought

 directed, they only tended to aggravate her present 
 state of embroilment, and accelerate her ultimate day of 
 thraldom ; his many distinguished virtues were fluctu- 
 ating and unstable, and proved on that account perni- 
 cious to his country, and even ruinous to himself. Pereny 
 admitted, within the still chambers of his mind, a single 
 but cankering vice, and also his otherwise brilliant quali- 
 ties were attended with that defect we have just men- 
 tioned. Like unto Reuben, despite " the excellency of 
 dignity and the excellency of power," he was " unstable 
 as water and might not excel." The vice was envy. 
 Like Haman, whose advancement '' availed him nothing, 
 so long as he saw Mordecai the Jew, sitting at the king's 
 gate," the distorted vision, the coeca invidia of Pereny, 
 alloyed whatever distinctions and honours were bestowed 
 on him. He could ill brook his station of comparative 
 inferiority, and was still dissatisfied, so long as he saw his 
 brother-in-law surpass him- in authority and influence 
 with the king. But let us not in this early stage of our 
 story yield to gloomy forebodings. Querela ab initio

 the Count Pereny, disregarding equally the asserted right

 grade to Alba Regalis, with the regal ensigns, to assist at 
 the coronation of the waivode. The ceremony was so- 
 lemnly performed at the hands of the bishops of Stri- 
 gonie t and Vacia, and a few days afterwards king John 
 acknowledged the signal service of Pereny, by appoint- 
 ing him to be one of the governors of the province of 
 Transylvania. Whether this dignity, however high, was

 credit acquired by Martinuzzi, on finding it eclipse his 
 own, cannot now be ascertained; nor indeed, in the 
 chronicles of the time, do we find any motive alleged for 
 the strange tergiversation of Pereny. The fact we are 
 about to relate is at least certain, * the particular induce- 
 ment must for ever remain among the impenetrabilia of a 
 hasty and uncertain character, f On the subsequent 
 invasion of Hungary by the Archduke Ferdinand, and 
 the flight of the king that followed his discomfiture at 
 Tocay, Pereny, who had illegally retained possession of 
 the diadem,! presented the sacred treasure to the Austrian, 
 as he had lately done to John of Zapola. The coronation 
 of Ferdinand, and Ann his wife, sister of the unfortunate 
 Lewis, was celebrated by the same prelate of Strigonie^ 
 with great pomp at Alba Regalis. The inconstancy -of 
 Pereny did not end here. After the restoration of Zapola, 
 the graf renewed his fealty where he had first pledged 
 it, and presently contrived to come to terms and recon- 
 cile himself to John. He was reinstated in his title and 
 oflSce of waivode II of Transylvania, and soon found him- 
 self so well established in the king's favour, as, being at 
 this time a widower, openly to make his addresses to the 
 princess Beatrice.^ The point of time at which we are 
 now arrived, brings us to the convention, which ended in 
 the fatal accord between the Hungarian monarch and the 
 Archduke, (newly elected king of Bohemia.) Herein it 
 was capitulated, that John of Zapola should retain 
 Hungary during the remainder of his lifetime, but that,

 on his demise, that kingdom should be thencefonvard 
 annexed to Austria. In this expedient for closing the 
 gates of anarchy, Avhich is said to have been suggested 
 to both parties, by their common mediator and friend, 
 Jerome Lascus, the historian, was deposited the fruitful 
 seeds of future wars and contentions. Viewed in what- 
 ever light, John was incompetent, of his own will, to 
 conclude and subscribe to any such compromise. The 
 constitution of the realm was an elective monarchy : and 
 further, John held his crown as a fief of the Porte ; but 
 in this unprincipled cession of the kingdom, neither 
 Solyman, on the one part, nor the magnates of the state, 
 assembled in national diet, on the other, had been con- 
 sulted. At the veto of either, the compact was clearly 
 void.* Ferdinand, however, may have reflected, that 
 it would be only a useless expenditure of blood and 
 treasure, any longer to contest the crown of Saint 
 Stephen with the present competitor; whilst John 
 of Zapoia's assent to the reversion of the kingdom, 
 at all events, opened a loop-hole for the chances of 
 the future. Whether either of the royal negociators 
 was ever sincere in the engagements he entered into, 
 is uncertain ; but not long after the aforesaid accom- 
 modation, at the repeated instances of his nobility, 
 John was induced, notwithstanding his advanced years, 
 to contract a matrimonial alliance with his cousin Isabella, 
 the daughter of Sigismund the First, king of Poland. 
 The loveliness of his bride might have made the match 
 acceptable to the monarch, while the desire of thw^arting

 recommended the union to his haughty and independent 
 magnates.* Thus, in due course of time, another power- 
 ful obstacle between the archduke and the attainment 
 of his ambitious projects, made its appearance, in the per- 
 son of the Infant Czerina, who, we take occasion to adver- 
 tise our readers, has done us the honour of assuming the 
 part of heroine in the eventful tale, which, according 
 to our humble ability, we shall presently proceed to tell. 
 Shortly after the birth of Czerina, the graf, Pereny, was 
 betrothed to the princess Beatrice ; but the espousals had 
 not been celebrated when the death of her royal brother 
 intervened. John for some time had been in a declining 
 state of health, notwithstanding which, he followed in 
 his chariot the large army he had despatched to Herman- 
 stadt, to put down the rebel Transylvanian chieftains, 
 Maylat and Balassi. In the course of that campaign, 
 the father of our heroine expired, and left his kingdom 
 as a sort of waif, free spoil to the earliest in the field, or 
 more like the jy res da of a chancery suit, which is (or was) 
 wont to be parcelled and preyed upon, sine die, by any 
 party, but the one most concerned. Ferdinand imme- 
 diately marched an army into Hungary, and invested 
 Buda. Martinuzzi, the counsellor of John in the most 
 momentous affairs of government, had long before that 
 monarch's demise been installed in the see of Waradin, 
 and nominated to the waivodeship of Transylvania, be- 
 sides having been created grand treasurer. He now 
 found himself appointed, by the will of his royal patron, 
 joint regent with the Queen-dowager Isabella, during the 
 minority of the youthful queen, who was bequeathed to 
 his especial guardianship, and recommended to his care.f

 could not have been conferred more deservedly, nor 
 such plenitude of power have been intrusted into abler 
 hands. 
 
 Count Pereny, perhaps mortified at his brother-in- 
 law's new accumulation of honour, again revolted, with 
 other Hungarian nobles, to the side of Ferdinand, who 
 was well pleased to take advantage of those civil dis- 
 cords, on which he rested his present influence, and 
 founded his hopes of future dominion. Pereny w^as pre- 
 sent at the investment of Buda, which was first relieved 
 by a victory, obtained by Martinuzzi over the Austrian 
 forces, in which the general-in-chief (Roccandolph,) was 
 mortally wounded, and the siege was afterwards wholly 
 raised, by the advance of Solyman himself at the head of 
 immense forces. Pereny again took shelter in the Aus- 
 trian dominions, where it was reported that Ferdinand 
 purposed rewarding services, which the fugitive had the 
 inclination, but not the power to perform, by giving him 
 in marriage his sister, the Queen Mary, relict of the un- 
 fortunate Lewis. If ever such alliance was seriously in- 
 tended by the parties most interested, they were not 
 allowed to remain long in its contemplation; for, after 
 awhile, we find the unhappy exile thrown into the state 
 prison of Vienna, on some charge of treasonable prac- 
 tices, the nature of which does not clearly appear. 
 
 The national party, having escaped the more imminent 
 danger of overthrow from their avowed enemy, the arch- 
 duke, was now to be obnoxious to the hardly less fatal 
 offices of their Ottoman allies. Solyman soon dictated 
 the price, at which he rated his friendship and protection. 
 Under pretence of guarding against any subsequent in- 
 vasion of Hungary by the Imperialists, he engarrisoned 
 with his forces most of the fortresses and towns of that 
 kingdom ; relegating the child of Zapola to the province 
 of Transylvania, and some of the bordering Banats, her 
 hereditary inheritance, and the only fragments of the 
 Hungarian dominions, which remained uncursed by a

 foreign yoke. The sultan, however, solemnly engaged to 
 deliver up the other states to " the heir of his good friend 
 John," when she was grown of an age, capable of taking 
 upon herself the reins of government. Czerina and her 
 mother sought refuge, in the first instance, in the city of 
 Lippa, beyond the river Tibiscus, and afterwards, on 
 Hermanstadt becoming the seat of the Transylvanian 
 government, they took up their residence in that capital. 
 Some few years elapsed when the Count Pereny, having 
 effected his escape from the dungeons of Vienna, again 
 appears upon the scene, to renew his suit for the hand of 
 the Princess Beatrice. At the earnest instance of the 
 Queen-dowager, backed by the authoritative sanction of 
 Solyman, the hand of the graf was accepted. A day 
 was appointed for the nuptials, which were intended to 
 be solemnized at Buda, under the auspices, and graced 
 by the presence of the all-powerful sultan. The Drincess 
 Beatrice, in company with her affianced husband, and 
 under the escort of a small troop, repaired from Transyl- 
 vania to the Hungarian capital. 
 
 On the skirts of the forest of Belivar, the party was 
 surprised by one of those strong bodies of Wallachian 
 marauders, which, in that age, superadded the horrors of 
 rapine and pillage, to the other evils that accumulated on 
 the wretched Magyari. — Pereny and his attendants were 
 put to flight, and the princess was borne away, but 
 whither was never ascertained. The gathering strength 
 of a most wild rumour soon fixed upon Vicchy of Eissen- 
 buro-, for the leader of these Wallachians : he was a 
 Hungarian nobleman of the highest rank, a near kins- 
 man of the Princess Beatrice, and further related to the 
 throne, having married the cousin of the late monarch. 
 At the period of King John's demise, this man was go- 
 vernor of Temeswar, and high constable of the king- 
 dom ; but shortly after that event, he resigned both 
 offices. As the character of Vicchy had hitherto ranked 
 above all suspicion, the testimony of several of Pereny's

 retinue, though seemingly corroborated by their earnest 
 and unanimous asseveration, was rejected by most men 
 as being utterly incredible. It was thought right, how- 
 ever, to cite Eissenburg to appear before the tribunal of 
 the king (judicium regale), to answer to the charge. 
 To the surprise of every one, he disregarded the sum- 
 mons. He was a second time required to surrender him- 
 self, under the penalty of otherwise being declared 
 guilty of the weighty accusation preferred against him : 
 still, whether in contumacy or apprehension, cannot be 
 affirmed, he neglected to deliver up his person ; and al- 
 though every body knew, he was all along residing on his 
 own estate, by the laws of Hungary, until his crime was 
 established, and sentence pronounced, his patent of no- 
 bility secured him from arrest.* At last, however, the 
 notoriety of the affair, and the absence of Eissenburg, 
 being deemed sufficient to supersede the necessity of any 
 more formal process, the detail of evidence was somewhat 
 summarily followed up by an attainder of outlawry. 
 
 The brideless bridegroom, after the calamitous occur- 
 rence we have just narrated, only showed himself for a 
 short period at the court of Hermanstadt ; and then, 
 having consigned his son, Maximilian, to the guardian- 
 ship of the boy's uncle, the regent Martinuzzi, he left 
 his native land, with the view, it was conjectured, of 
 drowning the bitter memory of his loss in other scenes, 
 and the excitement of travel. For many subsequent 
 years the movements of the wanderer cannot be traced ; 
 but some time anterior to the date of the following his-

 Meanwhile Transylvania was menaced with being ap- 
 propriated by the sultan, under the same insidious pre- 
 texts, that had answered but too successfully with Hun- 
 gary. But the destinies of the house of Zapola were 
 committed to no ordinary hands, and the regent was 
 not likely a second time to be taken by surprise. By the 
 intrigues of the Queen-dowager Isabella, who, grown 
 jealous of the conjunct authority of Martinuzzi, distrusted 
 his purposes, the affections of the nobles were alienated 
 from him, and a deep conspiracy was concerted for his 
 destruction. Isabella's principal agent herein was Va- 
 lentinian Count Turascus, who had been some years be- 
 fore tricked into prison by Solyman, and had only lately 
 effected his escape ; he was a Hungarian general of the 
 greatest reputation. 
 
 About the time that Solyman directed the pasha of 
 Buda to penetrate Transylvania with all his forces, and 
 Peter, prince of Moldavia, a savage marauding chief, 
 poured his wild hordes into the same province, count 
 Turascus took the opportunity, after several jars, followed 
 by formal and superficial reconciliations, to break out 
 into open revolt against Martinuzzi, whom he proclaimed 
 a tyrant and a traitor. To add to the desperate state of 
 things, a fourth army made an irruption into the princi- 
 pality. This consisted of a strong body of Imperialists, 
 aided by a few Spanish regiments, the whole under the 
 command of Castaldo, marquis of Piadena. And now, 
 assailed at once by foreign force, and shaken to the 
 centre by intestine division, all men prognosticated, from 
 such fatal concurrence, the ruin of their country. The 
 dominions of John of Zapola seemed on the point of pass- 
 ing from the rule of his house wholly and for ever, when 
 the enterprising valour of one man changed the aspect 
 of affairs. The lord regent, substituting the spear for 
 the crosier, and, so to speak, buckling on the cuirass over 
 the cassock, hurried from one end of the land to the 
 other, and roused by his eloquence and exhortations, the

 whole population to arms. In an incredible short space 
 of time, there was a general rally of the Hungarian pa- 
 triots, and he found himself at the head of between 
 fifty and sixty thousand combatants. It is not for 
 us to follow Martinuzzi through the brilliant operations 
 of that campaign, which only closed by the utter 
 discomfiture of the queen's party, and the rout and 
 dispersion of his opponents, whether foreign or do- 
 mestic. He first encountered the pasha of Buda, who, 
 after suffering a complete overthrow, fled, with such pre- 
 cipitation as, according to the historian, to retire in one 
 day over an extent of country, which it had taken him a 
 week to measure in advance. Valentinian Count Turas- 
 cus was then laying siege to Chonad ; and Martinuzzi, 
 informed of his position, made a hasty and fatiguing 
 march to that city. Allowing his soldiers only a small 
 interval for refreshment, he surprised the rebel camp in 
 the darkness of the night, took four thousand prisoners, 
 and left two thousand five hundred dead on the field of 
 battle. This important victory entirely broke the spirit 
 of the malcontents ; the grafs, maylat, and balassi, who 
 were preparing to revolt, made their submissions, and no 
 better resource was left to a great number of the mutinous 
 barons, holding like hostile sentiments, though of inferior 
 rank. But the mild disposition of Martinuzzi, or his pru- 
 dence, tempered the insolence of his triumph ; and his 
 sequent conciliatory conduct, was productive of more solid 
 benefit to his country, than was the victory itself. Turascus 
 returned to Hermanstadt, not as a conqueror, but as a 
 captive. 
 
 Being shortly after set at liberty, he was treated with the 
 greatest confidence and regard. Indebted, therefore, for 
 honours and attentions, in lavishing which Martinuzzi was 
 unremitting, Valentinian Turascus became gradually, by 
 gratitude, as well as interest, not disinclined to join the 
 opinion of those, who, for other reasons, desired the stabi- 
 lity of the regent's government. Hardly allowing his

 soldiers a day's respite, our belligerent prelate came up 
 with Peter the Moldavian, and although the Transylva- 
 nian force was considerably inferior, he so out-generaled 
 that ferocious freebooter, that he was compelled to betake 
 himself to flight, in the course of which five thousand 
 Moldavians are said to have perished. A more pleasing 
 trophy of this victory was the rescue of a thousand prisoners, 
 whom these war-hawks were carrying off into captivity. 
 Martinuzzi, finally, prepared to measure himself with the 
 imperial general, but such was the terror the warlike 
 gownsman had inspired, that Castaldo did not choose to 
 abide the issue ; he hastily drew off his forces beyond the 
 borders, and left the seven castles* free and unpolluted by 
 the presence of a single invader. The most solid reward, 
 and the most salutary consequence of these exploits of 
 Martinuzzi, are alike to be found in those terms of accom- 
 modation, which they enabled him to obtain. The sultan, 
 astonished at the attitude the province had taken, under 
 the presiding genius of the man, on whom, only a few 
 months before, he had pronounced sentence of deposition, 
 and whom he had stripped (on paper) of all his dignities, 
 sacerdotal and civil, yielding to the ascendant of " Prsesul 
 Georgius," wrote to acknowledge his authority, and pro- 
 pose an armistice. Ferdinand, not slow in emulating the 
 policy of the Musselman, likewise made advances of re- 
 conciliation. 
 
 Martinuzzi's powers of diplomacy were equally eminent 
 with his military capacity, and he possessed the talents, 
 both of managing men and conducting business. He so 
 dexterously made the rival views of these great potentates 
 counterbalance each other, that he concluded an honour- 
 able peace with both parties. Solyman consented to the

 himself to evacuate the rest of Hungary, when the heir of 
 John of Zapola should arrive at an age to govern. Fer- 
 dinand engaged, that no imperial army should thence- 
 forward transgress the boundary of the Theisse. That 
 monarch at the same time came to terms with the sultan, 
 and the foundation of the accord, as Augerius Busbequius 
 reports, was the payment of an annual tribute to the 
 Porte of 30,000 Hungarian ducats ; he, moreover, nomi- 
 nated Martinuzzi to the archbishopric of Strigonie,* which 
 was one of the chief cities, contained in that small division 
 of Lower Hungary, which the Austrians had first acquired 
 on the death of king John, and since tenaciously held. 
 The dignity of the Roman purple was not long behind. f — 
 Cardinal Martinuzzi, thus triumphant against the foreign 
 foe, insensibly seized the helm of state, as his self-inherent 
 and indisputable right. Though he did not think fit to 
 assume the title of king, he at least reserved to himself, 
 whenever he pleased, the power of ascending the throne; 
 and, however ambitious his views in that regard, it ap- 
 peared impossible they should exceed, what his courage 
 and capacity warranted his entertaining. He possessed 
 tliat lively confidence in himself, which is the pledge of 
 success, and he bore his exaltation with that calm and 
 modest equanimity, X which ever accompanies conscious 
 desert. It was soon seen, that his versatile genius could 
 adapt itself with equal facility to the toils of government, 
 as to the spirit-stirring occupation of the camp, and the 
 learning of the schools. In fact, the long continuance of 
 his administration^ after having abolished the co-ordinate

 We shall have to make mention of the hordes of no- 
 madic Moldavians and Wallachians, which, ever since 
 the invitation of Ladislas, laid waste and depopulated 
 the south-eastern extremity of Christian Europe. Some 
 previous notice of these people would seem, therefore, 
 indispensable to the reader's right understanding of the 
 ensuing pages. 
 
 Wallachia and Moldavia (called by the Turks, Bugdan) 
 had been successively over-run and subjected, by the 
 Goths, the Visigoths, the Huns,* the Gepidse, the Bul- 
 garians, and the Tartars. Apprehensive, in case of fur- 
 ther resistance, of being reduced, like Greece, to slavery, 
 they submitted, in 1418t to the Ottoman arms, and their 
 national existence was made thenceforth dependent on 
 the yearly payment of a trifling tribute (2000 crowns per

 annum) to the sultan.* However, at the time we com- 
 memorate, the population of modern Wallachia f pre- 
 sented rather the semblance of innumerable parties of 
 banditti than the usual characteristics of a distinct, 
 though conquered nation. Dark indeed, and stained 
 with blood, are the annals of these people — '' C'etoient 
 des hommes sauvages," says the historian, " qui par 
 leur aspect et surtout par leur moeurs resembloient plus 
 a des betes feroces qu'a des hommes — lis n'avoient 
 d'autre nourriture que le lait de leur troupeaux. lis 
 passoient les jours entiers dans les cavernes d'ou ils ne 
 sortoient que pour fendre sur les voyageurs qu'ils de- 
 pouilloient et tuoient impitoyablement. Ils ne con- 
 noissoient point de profession plus noble que celle de 
 vivre de rapines et de brigandages." And yet, predatory 
 as had long been their habits, and ignorant and savage 
 as were this singular race by nature (the Changlse, as they 
 are designated by William de Rubruquis), they claimed 
 the honour of being the descendants of ancient Rome, 
 uncontaminated by any admixture of barbarian blood ; 
 the direct posterity, in fact, of those Roman settlers, 
 whom the Emperor Aurelian (when the astonished Eagle 
 retired before the fell swoop of the northern Vultures) 
 left in Dacia, on his relinquishing the province to the 
 Goths and Vandals. 
 
 Such was their boast, and however vain and incre- 
 dible it may at first sound, the striking affinities between 
 their vernacular dialect and the Latin language, and the 
 circumstance of the costume of the lower orders being 
 precisely similar to that of the Dacians, as those people 
 are represented on Trajan's Pillar in Rome, would seem

 to establish on no weak grounds the truth of their tradi- 
 tion. With this, however, we have here no concern, but 
 dismiss the topic, by referring the curious reader to the 
 memoir of M. d'Anville on ancient Dacia.* Following 
 murder and rapine, as a profession, these roving de- 
 predators (de sangue Rumena — de sanguine Romano), 
 as they were proud to believe, would scatter themselves 
 over Hungary, carrying off the inhabitants with their 
 cattle and goods. Their numbers, in their excursive 
 hostilities, were to be counted by thousands and tens 
 of thousands, which successively swept the fertile country, 
 like a swarm of locusts, carrying dismay and desolation 
 on their wing. Having loaded themselves with what- 
 ever may have escaped the infidel or the Austrian,! they 
 were immediately lost amid the impervious woods and 
 morasses, which overspread the face of the land. Like 
 a wave which had spent itself on the beach, they would 
 withdraw, without let or hindrance, to the dominions 
 wlience they issued, and so leave room, after a brief in- 
 terval, for the inroad of fresh bands of their countrymen, 
 equally greedy of spoil and slaughter : "■ What the lo- 
 cust left, was devoured by the palmer- worm ;" while, year 
 after year, the booty grew less and less, and the glean- 
 ings became scarcer. These several parties of marauders 
 would form so many nuclei, round which the refuse of 
 Hungary, the evil disposed of all descriptions, were glad

 to range themselves, if not out of lawless sympathy, yet 
 for the sake of protection ; — such as being gradually 
 accustomed to live by plunder, were become incapable 
 of industry ; such as were driven by these unrepressed 
 depredations to shake off all bands of government, 
 whom their natural disposition, or grinding hardship and 
 an embittered spirit, rendered fit for any service, in which 
 they could, at the same time, gratify their vengeance, 
 and find subsistence — the disbanded Dolbatsche, or sol- 
 dier of infantry — the escaped criminal, — and more par- 
 ticularly the ^awac^z, or cattle-keeper — the Gidya, or 
 cattle-driver. These, inured to toil, their lives nurtured 
 by long impunity and the incitements of penury to 
 crime, would consort with the Wallachian invader, and 
 join him in his ravages of their native land ; or, remain- 
 ing stationary, would indicate, as the price of their ow^n 
 i mm unity, the fittest persons and places for attack ; of 
 course selecting those, by whose destruction private 
 pique might be safely gratified, or the love of pillage 
 best be satiated. Half the csardas, or inn-keepers, in 
 Hungary were in league with these robbers, either as 
 receivers or as accomplices. Even those serfs and herds- 
 men, who, to all appearance, obtained their livelihood 
 by honest industry, were more or less connected with 
 the foreign bands — sometimes to the extent of accom- 
 panying them in their predatory incursions through the 
 provinces. Their miserable want of education, or rather 
 the peculiar education induced by habit and circumstance, 
 which these peasants received from their youth upwards, 
 acted as an initiation and stimulus to a life of desperate 
 depravity. The untaught youth, constantly pasturing 
 their sheep or swine in the wooded solitudes of Erdely, 
 seldom, during the long summer, approached the habita- 
 tions of men. There was something in the very immen- 
 sity of the forests, by which they w^ere surrounded, that 
 impressed on the soul a feeling of sublime immunity. Se- 
 cluded from all observation, they w^ere often tempted to

 try their hand at a theft, whether it were of cattle or of 
 kreutzners, and to shed the blood of deer or buffalo ; or, 
 in an extreme case of precocious genius, perhaps to take 
 aim with the axe, they always carried about them, at the 
 travelling Jew or butcher. 
 
 Such juvenile feat made an admirable inition for the 
 incipient depredator and assassin. It consequently 
 sometimes happened, that the Hungarian peasant, from 
 being, at first, the mere spy, or, at most, the tolerated com- 
 rade of these warlike free-bands, would himself attain 
 command and authority in their armies ; and instances 
 are recorded where, by his abilities and valour, he has 
 risen to the rank of Richter, or independent chieftain, 
 over a body of many thousand troopers. Whenever 
 this was the case, the circumstance was found to operate 
 with some advantage to the wTetched community, so 
 long the prey of these lawless depredators. The arms 
 of the Wallachians were found capable of being di- 
 rected with effect against the common enemy, as was 
 exhibited to their immortal glory, by the decisive vic- 
 tory they obtained over Bajazet, at Tour Rouge, near 
 Hermanstadt in 1492. But the aid and good service 
 which the Roman barbarians experienced from the iso- 
 lated co-operation of the Hungarian cattle-keepers and 
 other peasantry, was trifling when compared with the 
 advantage they reaped, from associating to them the bands 
 of the Cyganis, or, as they were more commonly called 
 in Transylvania, the Pharaoh Nepek.* 
 
 The mention of these people opens a remarkable chap- 
 ter in the history of mankind, though it would lead us 
 too far out of our way were w^e to do more, than barely 
 enter upon it.

 most of the countries on the continent. They gave them- 
 selves out for Egyptian pilgrims, but it clearly appears, 
 from the researches of Grellman and others, that their 
 representation must have been untrue. From what 
 quarter of the world, they originally migrated still re- 
 mains a disputed point. The probability, however, is, 
 they were one of the itinerant tribes of India, whose 
 course reason or fortune directed to the banks of the 
 Nile, thence to transport themselves, shortly after, into 
 Europe. The exterminating war of Timur Beg might 
 have driven these Hindus to seek refuge in the Persian 
 desert, whence their wanderings eventually led them, over 
 the Isthmus of Suez, into Egypt. However this may 
 prove, it is certain that on their first appearance in 
 Europe, these vagrants inspired sentiments, wholly dif- 
 ferent from what are associated with their reputation at 
 tlie present day. Their assumption of the character of 
 pilgrims, at once elicited respect and obtained them pro- 
 tection ; and they were hailed with uncommon admira- 
 tion wheresoever they showed themselves. Hungary and 
 Transylvania were their high route into Germany, and 
 thousands of families chose to make a permanent settle- 
 ment in those territories, instead of accompanying their 
 brethren further on their endless exody. 
 
 If the period, at which we have taken up this history, 
 was not free from the reproach of superstition, neither 
 was it so servilely credulous an age, as were the centuries 
 preceding. The system of astrology still retained its 
 fascinating hold on the imagination ; and one can hardly 
 wonder at it, for who does not feel how sublime a thing 
 it must have been to entertain a faith in the speculation 
 of heaven ? But, as knowledge and science progressed, 
 the fictions of alchemy were fast clearing away, like the 
 igneous exhalations of the earth dissipating in the out- 
 breaking light of the ^' new-born day." Witchcraft, and 
 all the collateral arts of necromancy, were consigned to 
 merited opprobrium, and their professors to most un-

 merited persecution ; and, amongst other sources of de- 
 lusion, some time laid aside, as being out of date, by the 
 more sagacious futurity-mongers, was that peculiar spe- 
 cies of sorcery denominated chiromancy, which the Cy- 
 ganis or gipsies, having picked up in the age of which 
 we treat, immediately adopted as a distinguishing craft 
 and characteristic. In addition to this, they boasted a 
 familiarity with the secret virtues of plants and simples, 
 and professed to exorcise evil spirits out of bewitched 
 cattle, by means of roots and amulets, known only to 
 themselves. Moreover, during many years they mono- 
 polized the trade of gold- washing, that is, collecting and 
 clearing the particles of the aranyos f'dveny , or auriferous 
 sand deposited in the shoals and sandbanks of the Olt, 
 Dobrieza, Drave, and those other rivulets and streams 
 of Hungary and Transylvania, whose beds are to this day 
 sifted occasionally in search of the precious ore. 
 
 The Cyganis seem to have naturally possessed very 
 acute and delicate perceptions of sound, so that, be- 
 sides the means of emolument already detailed, their 
 musical talents, held in no light estimation by the un- 
 taught peasantry of Hungary, conjured at least as many 
 kreutzers into their pockets, as the case called for. They 
 were occupied at intervals in making iron tools, horn 
 spoons, baskets, and other articles of a similarly trivial 
 and ingenious description ; and, after a while, they be- 
 came especially celebrated for their singular taste and 
 facility in fabricating the instruments of war ; in return 
 for which manufacture, and partly in recompence for 
 their bravery and personal achievements, whole hordes 
 of these Hindostanee would frequently receive passports 
 and seals from the princes or magnats, whom they aided 
 with their workmanship, or under whom they served. 
 
 In Transylvania, the ruling waivodes had long granted 
 letters of protection to these artificers in iron work. 
 Many of such safe-conducts of the located Cyganis are 
 still extant, one of which we quote, as bearing upon the

 history we have in hand. It is a document of King- 
 Ladislas, dated 1496, for the knowledge of which we are 
 indebted to Friedwalsky , who cites it in his "Mineralogy." 
 Therein it is ordered, " That every officer and subject, 
 of whatever rank and condition, do allow to Count 
 Thomas Polgar, leader of five hundred tents of wandering 
 Cyganis, free residence every where, and on no account 
 to molest him or his descendants, or his or their people, 
 because they had prepared military stores for the Bishop 
 Sigismond at Fiinfkirchen. — Ladislas.'' 
 
 In the above record the reader may, perhaps, be sur- 
 prised to find the rank of Count attributed to the con- 
 ductor of a gang of gipsies. But it seems on their first 
 arrival in Hungary, that each tribe had its own leader, 
 distinguished by the proud title of Knight, Count, Duke 
 or King, and through whose medium they were more 
 readily summoned by the officers of state, when their ser- 
 vices were required against the infidel. These people 
 formed a kind of society or government among them- 
 selves, which set all more enlightened legislation at defi- 
 ance, and, though ill-fitted for executing any extensive 
 military enterprise, still any opposition to their progress 
 or their will was not lightly to be risked. The son of the 
 aforesaid Count Polgar, who, besides being the heredi- 
 tary leader of five hundred tents of gipsies, was invested 
 with unlimited authority over all the inferior chiefs of the 
 Cygani tribes in Hungary, was the celebrated Alaric 
 Polgar, also passing by the name of Count Ragotzy, with 
 whom the reader will presently become acquainted. That 
 gipsy leader was of another metal from his father; so 
 far from furnishing military stores in aid of the govern- 
 ment, we find reason to believe that he exerted all his 
 influence over his predatory subjects to inculcate disobe- 
 dience to the laws as the prime obligation of a Cygani, 
 and the necessity of his position in society. The various 
 tribes, who, beneath the rule of Count Thomas Polgar, 
 were so many parties of pilferers and fortune-tellers, in-

 variably tolerated, and frequently (as we have seen in one 
 instance) placed under the especial protection of the 
 authorities, assumed under the auspices and aspiring con- 
 duct of his son, the formidable attitude of leagued and 
 organized bands of robbers, scorning all resistance, and 
 setting every attempt at defiance to subject and civilize 
 them. One principal cause of this impunity, as we be- 
 fore intimated, is to be sought in the division of parties, 
 incident to a feeble or restricted executive, and to the 
 otherwise frightful state of public affairs, where all the 
 bands of social life seemed resolved back into their ori- 
 ginal elements ; however, the chief confidence of these 
 wild and lawless companies rested in the synchronal ex- 
 istence of the Wallachian and Moldavian banditti, with 
 many of whose Richters, Alaric Polgar had formed a 
 strict and federative alliance. But any combined plan 
 of operation, having for its object the imposition of 
 a new dynasty over the Magyar nation, and the exal- 
 tation of the conqueror, does not appear hitherto to 
 have been in the contemplation of Count Alaric. His 
 views, as we have said, were confined to scouring and 
 devastating the land, not to conquering and subjecting 
 it. The gangs of the Cyganis, whose tactics were much 
 more adapted for plunder and marauding than for open 
 warfare, wandered up and down, committing spoil upon 
 the country, and perpetrating with impunity the wildest 
 excesses of oppression. Their numbers were often very 
 inconsiderable, and if ever they met (which was but sel- 
 dom) with any opposition, they avoided coming to a ge- 
 neral engagement, by betaking themselves to flight. Very 
 many Moldavian cliiefs, were, in like manner, used to 
 assemble their independent tribes, sometimes confining 
 their ravages to the neighbouring province of Transylva- 
 nia, at others spreading themselves over the fertile vales 
 of Lower Hungary; but in all cases, their incursions 
 were so sudden, that, even in the most distant quarter, 
 the absence of the enemy was no reason why any district

 should esteem itself in safety. Still, as much as possi- 
 ble, they would keep within a day or two's summons of 
 their great richter, who, at the period of the opening of 
 our story, was Peter, Prince of Moldavia, famed for his 
 courage and strength of body, but stigmatized by con- 
 temporaries with the epithet of bloody. 
 
 The danger of this universal licence was derived from 
 the factious and turbulent spirit of the kingdom, which 
 nothing contributed more to increase or to encourage, 
 than the precarious allegiance of the feudal noble, who, 
 in too many instances, not merely submitted to their ex- 
 actions, but joined himself in amity with the Wallachian 
 richter, and the gipsy count, either for his own imme- 
 diate safety, or to serve purposes, even more inexcusable. 
 Ever engaged in hereditary or personal animosities, or 
 confederacies with his neighbours, and free from all sa- 
 lutary restraint, during this temporary dissolution of 
 sovereign authority, he would sally from his castle, some- 
 times in quest of plunder, sometimes of private resent- 
 ment and revenge. The desolate condition of the country, 
 over which these various and savage foes extended the 
 fangs of their rapacity, might, to adopt the figue of Gib- 
 bon, have been compared by Homer to the two lions 
 growling over the carcase of a mangled stag.* Such a 
 disorganization of society became no slight obstacle to 
 the introduction of a regular administration of justice. 
 The loose police, incident to the feudal constitution, was , 
 a machine of dangerous and delicate management, ever 
 apt to recoil upon the hand which held it. Being wholly 
 inadequate to cases of emergency, it was, at the period 
 of history which we are reviewing, every where falling 
 into disuse. In Hungary this was more particularly ex- 
 emplified ; there the barons rarely acted in union, and,

 though for the most part capable of laughing to scorn 
 any attack on their own strong holds, the prcedia or terri- 
 tory of each was too inconsiderable in itself to support 
 the burden of a regular military force, for purposes of 
 general security. As the strength of the government, 
 under existing circumstances, was ill able to cope with 
 so enormous a grievance, Martinuzzi was led to remedy 
 it by policy. Their habits of war and depredation had 
 given the Wallachian bands experience, hardiness and 
 courage, and by enlisting in his body of mercenaries 
 many of their choicest captains, he, in a great measure, 
 removed from that nation, at once the temptation and 
 the ability of much troubling Transylvania. He deferred 
 the vindication of justice, and to endeavour the re- 
 establishment of order in the community to a more fa- 
 vourable juncture, when, by the assistance of one of the 
 neighbouring powers (without whose co-operation indeed, 
 the attempt seemed hopeless) these licentious brigands 
 might either be expelled the country, or tamed to the 
 salutary yoke of law and government. Having thus, 
 with whatever tediousness, initiated the reader into the 
 peculiarities of the times and countries, which make the 
 foundation of our story, we will no longer detain him 
 from its perusal.

 '' He gave him first his breeding, 
 
 Then showered his bounties on him like the hours,

 Ben Jonson. 
 
 The sober sunshine of autumn had succeeded to the 
 heats of summer, and the undulating tracks of forest, 
 which, spreading themselves over a vast region of country, 
 gave a name to the theatre of our history,* had begun to 
 assume that dappled livery, with which the varied year 
 would fain disguise and beautify its decay, when we take 
 leave to commence our narrative. 
 
 It wanted an hour of midnight, and the moon was sail- 
 ing high overhead, and the vast curtain, which shuts in 
 heaven, might have made a queen long to deck her with 
 a mantle of that same regal hue, begemmed with starry 
 ornaments, when the attention of a sentinel, who was 
 pacing an outer rampart of the city of Hermanstadt, was 
 attracted by the echo of horses' hoofs in the distance, and 
 soon after, by the approach of three horsemen towards

 the western barrier. They came on at length, and, 
 having demanded admittance within the gates, were in- 
 formed, that they must wait without till morning. This 
 intimation excited the manifest wrath of the equestrians, 
 who loudly vented their indignation on the hapless head 
 of the sentinel, — consigning the city, its regent, and in- 
 habitants to the tender mercies of that personage, who 
 for the last eighteen hundred years, has had a monopoly 
 of such sort of ofterings. 
 
 " I tell you what, good sir travellers," exclaimed the 
 sentinel, whom the pertinacious abuse and riotous con- 
 duct of the men, at length began to exasperate beyond 
 his modicum of patience : ''if you don't desist from this 
 clamour, I shall be under the unpleasant necessity of send- 
 ing a quietus in the shape of a leaden bullet through 
 your jerkins." 
 
 " At your pleasure, friend," replied one of the trio 
 thus threatened, at the same time advancing his horse 
 out of the shadow of a jutting barbacan into the moon- 
 light. "Level your musket; if you hit us we will trouble 
 no further ; but depend upon't we'll not cease from de- 
 manding admittance till you do." 
 
 The person who thus spoke was apparently in the 
 prime of manhood, and clad in the knightly armature of 
 an Olah, or roving chief of Wallachia. The other two 
 horsemen appeared his followers. 
 
 " Well, only to think how fool-hardy some folks are," 
 exclaimed the sentinel ; " but that's no concern of mine ; 
 I must do my duty ; so, mark me, you, careering there 
 so jauntily, there's a cloud now covers the moon's disk ; 
 if, ere she shows her face again, you be not out of the 
 reach of my carabine, why take the consequence, that's 
 all," and with these words the man presented his piece. 
 
 The horsemen set up a loud and long laugh — a laugh 
 of contemptuous defiance. Even while the sound rung 
 in the welkin, the moon slowly emerged beyond the 
 flimsy veil which obscured her beams, and as the last

 rim of the planet broke from the sheltering cloud into 
 the immeasurable ether, the man fired. There was the 
 flash — the report, and then the eddying smoke hid for a 
 few seconds from the sentinel the fallen figure of the 
 liorseman, at whom he had aimed, and whom he natu- 
 rally apprehended he had shot. What then was his 
 amazement, as the atmosphere cleared, to behold him 
 sitting his horse with as firm a seat, and apparently as 
 unconcerned as if his life had not just been placed in 
 such imminent risk. Immediately the sentinel con- 
 ceived a more exalted opinion of those clamorou's 
 equestrians, and remembering the hour chosen for their 
 visitation, and their apparent impassableness to fire-arms, 
 he began to entertain some vague apprehension that 
 they were three spirits riding this upper world, in the 
 guise of carnal warriors. While these suspicions were 
 producing sad confusion in the head of the simple senti- 
 nel, the captain of the night-guard came upon the scene, 
 and demanded the cause of the signal he had just heard. 
 The sentinel made his report. After a minute's thought, 
 the subaltern addressed himself to the horseman, who was 
 nearest, and acquainted him, in more urbane terms, than 
 had been hitherto employed, with the utter impossibility 
 of his being admitted within the city that night. 
 
 The individual to whom this was addressed, inclining 
 his body forward, and, laying his hand upon the mane 
 of his steed, made answer, by inquiring whether the 
 speaker were the captain of the night-guard ? Being in- 
 formed that such was the fact, the horseman rejoined in 
 an authoritative voice, " Well, then, do you understand, 
 I must have speech of the lord regent to night : I bear 
 missives from Coloswar ; so do not oppose our entrance, 
 lest worse come of it." 
 
 " W^hy," returned the subaltern, as if deliberating with 
 himself, " were Father Dominick in the way — but no," 
 he added, lowering his voice to a tone of significance.

 " his reverence hath ceased to walk o' nights, as was his 
 wont." 
 
 This intelligence, for some reason or other, seemed to 
 strike with an electric force on the ears of the eques- 
 trian ; who, starting his horse forward, as if thrown ofF 
 his guard, exclaimed, " What's that you say, Hubert?" 
 The officer, without paying any attention to this interro- 
 gatory, cast a side and scrutinizing glance at his com- 
 rade, and resuming his official reserve, drily remarked, 
 '* I repeat, sirs, 'tis impossible !" but ere the words were 
 well out of his mouth, the horseman impetuously inter- 
 posed — 
 
 " Impossible ! I tell you, I will lie this night in yon- 
 der citadel, though all the fiends of hell gainsaid me I 
 Where is Father Dominick — not walk o'nights ! — what 
 means he ? Is he mad ? All Hungary up, and Transyl- 
 vania in flames, and Father Dominick not out upon the 
 ramparts — you must lie i'your throat, man ! And such 
 a night, not to steal him from his bed of thorns ! — Can I 
 believe my ears ? — the Archduke in arms, and he not 
 walk the ramparts ! Oh, 'tis palpably false ! The sultan 
 in Belo-rade, and Father Dominick bed-ridden ! Then, 
 indeed, are we on the eve of some convulsion of the ele- 
 ments that constitute the mind of man. But though all 
 nature were in universal uproar, I will speak with a voice, 
 might rive the solid earth, and pierce the depths of chaos 
 a4id of darkness, — a voice more fearful than the thunder ; 
 and though the towers of Hermanstadt topple from their 
 foundation at the dread subject of our parley, it shall 
 not interrupt me ; though the grave of John of Zapola 
 yawn, and give up its sheeted relics at our least whisper, 
 — though this be, which cannot well be otherwise, still I 
 swear. Father Dominick and I ivill balance accounts this 
 night — I swear it ! If I be perjured, it is for him to 
 tremble — So be it, in God's name !" 
 
 " Amen, in God's name!" murmured a hollow and

 well-known voice in the speaker's ear. He started ; then, 
 with a strong effort to recover his self-possession, he slowly 
 turned his head. The response came from Father Domi- 
 nick, who stood close beside the knight. 
 
 The latter, it appeared, had been so hurried away by 
 the extreme violence of his feelings, and was so lost to 
 all outward objects, whilst his spirit found vent in lan- 
 guage, not less mysterious than impassioned, that he had 
 not remarked the being, whose presence he so earnestly 
 insisted upon, detach himself from the stretch of brush- 
 wood and huge masses of rock, which were scattered 
 over the heath, and glide with an admirable mixture of 
 silence and celerity, towards the base of the ramparts ; so 
 that it was not till the holy father was close upon him, 
 and had delivered the response we have just related, 
 that he became aware of his proximity. The torrent 
 of rage and invective in which the chieftain had just 
 indulged, contributed to throw him off his balance. 
 He could not readily bear up against the reflux of his 
 feelings. The man, whose appearance he invoked with 
 such indignant violence, having, like a spectre, obeyed 
 the summons of his enchanter, and acknowledged the po- 
 tency of the spell, awed him back in spite of himself, 
 into comparative insignificance. He lost somewhat of 
 his wonted self-possession, and his dissolute nature stood 
 abashed and humbled from its late passion, merely, as it 
 would seem, by the overpowering appulse of the loftier 
 mind of the ghostly father. 
 
 The monk was wrapped " from top to toe," in the flow- 
 ing habit of his order, girded to his shape by a strong 
 cord, which, suspending a leaden crucifix of uncommon 
 size, fell downwards to the edge of the robe. With his 
 arms folded over his breast, his head bent, and his cowl 
 extended over his face, he abided the determination of 
 the chieftain. Finding, however, that that individual, 
 apparently overwhelmed with the consequence of his own

 violence, made no attempt to break the silence, he himself 
 shortly spoke. 
 
 " Dismiss thine attendants," he said in a hollow under 
 voice: " they can wait for orders at St. Agatha, you will 
 follow me." 
 
 Having thus delivered himself, the monk slowly moved 
 away amid the thickets and underwood, which skirted the 
 extensive heath in the quarter, from which he had first 
 entered upon the scene. His form was soon after dis- 
 cerned in the half distance, — his apparel blending with 
 the lights and shadows of the ground, like a spectre 
 slowly vanishing away. For some moments the chieftain 
 noted him, appearing and disappearing where the stunted 
 tufts of arbutus and magnolia broke the uniformity of the 
 moon-light heathy, until the brow of a rising ground con- 
 cealed him from his view; then, as if lost in inward 
 musing: — '' No," he muttered between his teeth; '* no, 
 he dare not play me false, though the stake he holds, and 
 the pinnacle he aims at, might make such a man as he 
 venture boldly, and my cognition of his position, per- 
 chance is the sole drawback between him and impunity: — 
 um! I'll see to it:" — and the chieftain raised his voice, 
 addressing himself to the captain of the guard. 
 
 There was a peculiarity in his tone and manner, that 
 implied more than the literal purport of his words, as he 
 said: — *' Here, friend, receive this packet and a sealed 
 box I have under my dolman, either of which contains a 
 treasure dear to this land as is her sainted crown. If, ere 
 to-morrow eve I do not, in my proper person, reclaim them* 
 of you, fly with them to the queen, the queen regent, — you 
 mark me? — give them into her royal keeping, and, as you 
 would ensure the promise of Unna, and value the cause 
 you are pledged to, into no hands else. 'Tis a sealed 
 commission, will you accept it? — speak." The oflScer 
 intimated his consent by a slight inclination of the head. 
 " Descend, then, the turret stairs, and take them, and do

 you, Reginald and Walter, return to the drawbridge of 
 St. Agatha. Should you not hear from me before the 
 next sun-set, back to the Moldavian quarters, and tell 
 Peter to look to himself, and to remember me as one sa- 
 crificed for his advantage; and when next you see Unna, 
 give her this token," and drawing from his finger a ring, 
 he handed it to one of the men, "'twill suflfice — or if you 
 say a word, be it only — revenge! Have a care of my 
 gallant grey, meanwhile, and away with ye." 
 
 He consigned the reins of his barded destrier into his 
 follower's hands, who, with his comrade, immediately re- 
 tired at a pace, which soon carried them out of view, and 
 the receding echoes of their horses' hoofs died away on 
 the breeze, as an iron-grated wicket or sallyport, partially 
 hidden from view by a massive advanced work of the 
 barbacan, was thrown open by the officer who had just 
 descended the stair, leading from the battlement to the 
 archway beneath. He reached out his hand through the 
 interstice to take the packet from the chief, who, after 
 the man had received it, thrust through the aperture the 
 heavier article, a small, though strongly secured iron box, 
 previously enfolded in his muster-piece. " Be careful 
 of them, sir," said the chief, in a low, but impressive voice; 
 *' and remember," he proceeded solemnly, '' they are to 
 be delivered into the queen mother's hands, and hers 
 only. On your allegiance! Hubert;" he added, in an 
 emphatic whisper ; " and, as you would fulfil the prophesy 
 of Unna, do this." The attentive federary made no 
 reply, but directly closed the wicket. 
 
 *^ So," thought the chief, " I am armed at all points for 
 the outrance ;" and he turned away from the barbacan to 
 follow Father Dominick; when, at the distance of a few 
 paces from the arched entrance underneath the porch, 
 his eyes lit upon the ill-omened figure of the very person 
 in question, who, quite motionless, stood with his face 
 inclined towards the ground, and his dark robes folded 
 round him. " There again!" thought the dark-eyed

 chieftain, at the same time advancing towards the mj'ste- 
 rious monk: "There again! he starts before my sight 
 like an echo, and gives a palpable form to my unexpressed 
 misdoubtings. Courage, Ragotzy ! let not thy heart fail 
 thee now. Think what mighty issues are on the cast ; that 
 cause is lost already, whose champion's spirit quails ere 
 a blow be struck: then, come what can come, the worst 
 is " He paused in his mental argument as he stood be- 
 side Father Dominick, who remarked, as they both slowly 
 directed their cautious steps along a scarce-tracked, al- 
 though not precipitous path, which led to the summit of a 
 rising ground. '^ I thought, from your delay, you might 
 have changed your mind, and I came back, hoping to find 
 it so. It had been better ; you can have nothing to say be- 
 fitting me to hear: our paths lie as far asunder as earth 
 is from heaven. Would you would yet pause! you 
 rashly venture your footing on the verge of a dizzy 
 precipice; young man, t'would try a sounder head than 
 yours, and you may be nearer the brink than you 
 imagine. Leave Hermanstadt — for both our sakes t'were 
 wiser." 
 
 "For yours 1" interrupted the other in a low under- 
 growl, which, although scarcely intended by the speaker, 
 reached the ears of the Holy Father, who continued : — 
 
 " I repeat. Count Ragotzy, for both our sakes, — your's 
 temporally; mine, perhaps," — his voice trembled, and 
 breaking off, he added in a milder tone : "let this matter 
 end here, and I will forgive the past — the present !" 
 
 " The past, the present, and the future," said the other, 
 repeating the sentence significantly, and laying a strong 
 accent on the last word — occulta Veritas tempore patet ! — 
 There was a long and solemn pause — both parties re- 
 lapsed into the silence of unuttered thought, holding com- 
 munion with their hearts, whilst a crowd of conflicting 
 retrospection, thronged on their memories, and appre- 
 hensions of approaching evil, crude, undefined, and 
 dreadful, flitted, as if from a new opened source, like

 vague glimpses of the mysterious future, across their 
 brains. 
 
 Having reached the summit of the gentle eminence, 
 they stopped short — a thicket composed of stunted brush- 
 wood (the meagre efforts of a soil unfavourable for vege- 
 tation,) and a few dwarf trees, now besprent with dew and 
 moon-light, that mingled in prismatic beauty, crowned 
 the ascent. There, halting for a while, neither seemed 
 disposed to interrupt the mutual silence, or to start the 
 momentous subject they were on the point of discussing, 
 and which evidently was still the uppermost in both their 
 minds. From the point of view where they reposed them- 
 selves, they might behold, at a little distance, the towers 
 and ramparts of the ancient Cibinium. The city reared 
 its warrior battlements against the sky, and relieved by 
 gloomy shadows, stood out sternly fair, with its double 
 walls and glacis. It was situate, not far from the course 
 of the rapid Olt, which, bending gracefully round the 
 south side of the battlements with a broad sweep, shot 
 from thence that beautiful stream of water, commonly 
 called the Zibin, into the heart of the city; whilst beyond 
 to the left, in mid moon-light, loomed against the starry 
 horizon, like the dominating genius of the place, the 
 frowning donjon-keep, to which Herman of Nuremberg 
 gave his name. This night-view, though not extensive, 
 was a beautiful one, and withal serene and solemn in its 
 loveliness. Before them stretched the distant perspective 
 of a wild moor, which was closed by an amphitheatre of 
 swelling woodland, clothed in an atmosphere of yellow 
 mist. A strange solitude reigned over that dark brown 
 heath, intersected with masses of rock and furze, and che- 
 quered and dotted here and there with plots of close green- 
 sward, bedecked with hoary rime, that, in the universal 
 quiet, glittered like diamonds beneath the broad light of 
 the silvery moon : solitude and silence, for the deep re- 
 pose of the scene was undisturbed by any sound, save 
 what was most in unison with the character of the night, —

 save the low lulling clink of an unseen rill, tinkling under 
 some neighbouring covert, or the soothing melancholy 
 gurgling of many a mountain-streamlet far away, fret- 
 ting and foaming in their contracted ravines. These 
 made choral music on the lulled ear, like the mingled 
 voices of the Numina loci — the rustica Numina Fauni. 
 All nature seemed to sleep in the deep tranquillity of 
 moon-light. — Occupied in planting their intellectual 
 batteries, and as it were, furbishing their mental armoury 
 for the onset, the monk and his companion might be 
 likened to two gladiators in the arena ; each confident 
 in his own courage and prowess, yet unwilling to be the 
 first to throw down the gage of defiance, which must 
 bring the question of their difference to an issue. So 
 there and thus they stood ; that monk and chieftain, face 
 to face, within a lance's length of each other, — the sole 
 animations visible in the universal quietude. 
 
 After along and fearful silence. Count Ragotzy sought 
 to terminate the deep suspense, as to each other's purpose, 
 under which they laboured — a suspense, the awful calm 
 of which might be said to resemble one of those porten- 
 tous pauses of nature, which precede some dreadful con- 
 vulsion of the elements. " You looked for my arrival to 
 night?" he said; and this w^as delivered interrogatively, as 
 much with the view of breaking the chilly and embarrassed 
 silence, and so obliging his holy companion to speak, as 
 from any doubts respecting the nature of the response. 
 The monk made a slight affirmative motion with his head, 
 and then after a moment added, " Your emissary arrived 
 in Hermanstadt yesterday." 
 
 " How then am I to interpret?" began the chieftain. 
 
 " Hear me, misguided man!" interrupted the other, and 
 though his face worked for a moment, he spoke in a 
 conciliatory tone, — " let me once again condescend to 
 the language of entreaty. Proceed in your present 
 design, be it what it may, no further. By my care 
 of thee in thy boyhood — by my preservation of thy being

 — by the memory of what thou once promised — by 
 the fatal certainty of what thou art — by thy departed 
 innocence, and by all that I have done, and suffered by 
 thy infliction, and for thy benefit ; I charge and adjure 
 thee forego thy terrible, though unknown purpose. 
 Urge me in this, thou threatenest, no further ; I am but a 
 mortal man ; — be advised, Count Ragotzy, I now implore ; 
 but beware ! remember my power, and assay not my 
 temperament beyond bearing." 
 
 The unfaltering spirit of the Count blenched not a jot, 
 while, concentrating all his powers of voice, and all his 
 energies of mind, he replied, " Why these strange con- 
 jurings? 1 am not now to learn how deeply I was 
 formerly indebted to thy benevolence, though I may sus- 
 pect your purpose in exhibiting such superfluous charity ; 
 and be thy claims on my gratitude all you would have 
 them, they cannot exceed the measure of my services 
 to thee." 
 
 '^Monster of insolence and ingratitude!" exclaimed 
 the incensed father — "what on my part, save hate and 
 horror, can there be owing to such an abandoned as 
 thyself?" 
 
 *' Your station, your fair name, your very life," replied 
 the other undauntedly — " they are one and all in my dis- 
 cretion, and for years have been, proud man !" 
 
 "Captain of brigands! take heed," ejaculated the 
 priest with a quivering lip. "Thou dost forget thyself, 
 and knowest not what thou wouldst have. Be warned ere 
 too late. Thou hast said and done too much already for 
 the vile worm to tamely suffer. I have borne infinitely 
 more at your hands, than I ever could have believed was 
 in my nature to endure from aught of woman born. And 
 yet thou dost accumulate thine injuries upon me, as if I 
 were not that I am. I say again, take heed !" 
 
 The chieftain burst into a horrid laugh— a laugh of 
 defiance. — "Who art thou, then?" he exclaimed— " Ha! 
 ha! ha! I hold thee for Father Dominick, the inscrutable

 Father Dominick, the dreaded and the dark one ! — but let 
 that pass; I reck not now who thou art, nor indeed what 
 thou seemest: here on this open moor, away from the sight 
 and hearing of man, with nought but these dingles of 
 furze and broom, this wilderness of crag and rock around 
 us, and a clear expanse over our heads. Here at least 
 we are on an equality; here we can declare our inmost 
 souls, as is fitting, and comport ourselves as man ever 
 should with man, free to speak, to strike, — free in the 
 sight of Heaven." 
 
 *' Well then, in God's name, so be it !" returned the 
 monk, fronting the brigand as he spoke, in a calm, yet a 
 hollow voice. " For this once I will borrow patience to 
 listen to you, and will lay aside all reminiscences con- 
 nected with your past behaviour, nor remember auo-ht, 
 save that you and I, face to face, this night, — but not 
 alone, mark me! not alone, Ragotzy ! — stand on this 
 barren heath, for the last time. I will abdicate my 
 rights, and descend from my pinnacle of power ; but for 
 the last time ! Here then, Alaric, with earth, and air, and 
 sky for witnesses, and countless spiritual natures, which 
 are said to love to haunt the moon-lit scenes of earth, 
 for lookers on; let us proceed to business! — with God's 
 finger visibly impressed on all creation, with God's eye, — 
 look up ! How the massive cope of heaven hangs sus- 
 pended over us! — with God's eye (mark me!) on our 
 heart of hearts — why let's to work. If, Count Ragotzy, 
 it own no terrors with which to inspire your soul — perhaps 
 I wrong you. For me — here, take my hand, sir, and judge 
 yourself, if my heart be not faithful to my will; the pulse 
 beats strong and regularly, as in battle, doth it not? — 
 The blood retires not at the contact. Not even in your 
 grasp doth the flesh shrink, Alaric. — I am as calm as 
 sleep — like that hand is my fixed soul and steadfast 
 spirit, — I am as calm as sleep." The speaker paused ; 
 then withdrawing his hand from that of the count, at the 
 same time fixing a commanding and penetrating glance

 upon his countenance, as if to read his inmost heart — he 
 added, "Now, what's your errand ? — Why hath Count 
 Ragotzy left his canvass palaces, and come uninvited, 
 like a disease, to Hermanstadt? On what ground of fell 
 mischief hath he sought to darken my life by his presence, 
 bound as he is, by the indenture of plighted oaths and 
 solemn pledges, to forbear me ? Or rather, let me ask, 
 what sacred office does he wish me to yield up to be 
 abused, like earth, for that which may be wrung from out 
 its vitals ? — What boon comes next, which must be granted 
 to bribe thy venal and injurious tongue? — Nay, sir, I'll to 
 the point. Then in one word (and the monk's voice fell 
 to the modulated cadence proper to the sentiment,) in 
 what way, my son, can I oblige you ? what is it you re- 
 quire at my hands ?" And his manner, whilst delivering 
 this last inquiry, was replete with all the suavity of the 
 most polished breeding and loftiest station. Whatever 
 impression the above address made upon Ragotzy, neither 
 his looks quailed nor his voice trembled, as, confronting 
 the monk, with an eye as unappalled as his own, he 
 replied. 
 
 " I have need of your services : you can oblige me ; 
 and you, of all mankind, only can." 
 
 "How? say on," rejoined the other, with a hollow 
 and cold smile; " I have already showered no slight 
 obligations upon Count Ragotzy, although it accords not 
 with his present mood to acknowledge them ; show me 
 how further I can contribute to his pleasure ; he shall 
 find me, in truth, a very slave to his wishes." — The 
 monk ceased; but Ragotzy replied not. — "Well, well," 
 presently rejoined Father Dominick ; " to what should all 
 this preparation lead ? Tell me, I say, what makes 
 you hitherward ?" 
 
 " Troops were out for the arrest of the prince of 
 Moldavia, and I liked not wintering in their neighbour- 
 hood," answered the count : "'tis too shrewd an atmo- 
 sphere ; you are milder here ; do you understand ?"

 ** Milder !" repeated the monk, and he stamped his 
 foot violently on the earth — " you may find this too hot ! 
 
 — Death ! Do you play with me ? What's Peter the 
 Bloody — well does he merit that infamous epithet! — 
 what is he to you? But that's not what you would now 
 speak of; — despatch your present need, sir, and let us 
 part. Is't my purse ?" 
 
 " Your purse!" repeated the Cygani leader ; '* trash ! 
 
 — gold purchases me not, nor my desires. Hark you ! — 
 at once I feel my great importance too deeply, to barter 
 that which makes men wealthy, for any measured dross. 
 I will have visible power — 'tis clear we distrust each 
 other, and shall do so till the fates of both are closer 
 linked, in happiness or " 
 
 " Death !" said the monk. 
 
 " Just so," returned the other, coolly. 
 
 Again there followed a long pause, which was broken 
 by the monk. " Say at once where thy discourse 
 drives," he cried — " disclose thy darker purpose." 
 
 " 1 love," answered the count ; and he spoke hur- 
 riedly, as if the words required a strong effort to be 
 driven from his lips, and that he hardly trusted himself, 
 with the consideration of what he said. 
 
 " You love ?" faintly echoed the monk, recoilino-. 
 " Can you love ?" he presently added, still more in- 
 audibly. 
 
 " A fair Hungarian, whom I would wed," rejoined the 
 other, with the same forced and rapid intonation of voice 
 as before. 
 
 The monk's visage lowered, and the livid lines of his 
 pale countenance, as reflected in the full blaze of ni^-ht, 
 assumed a ghastly hue. With manifestly constrained 
 air, perceiving, by the count's silence, that he awaited 
 his reply, he said — " Well, well ; and you opine, that tiie 
 mediation of an old man like me will aid you in your 
 suit. Albeit these light gauds of gallantry, these gew-o-aws 
 of romance, possess no longer any value in my eyes.

 The breathing of a loveliness doth stir in me no more the 
 fine-discoursing chords, which yield the tongue's rare 
 music. — Ragotzy," proceeded the monk, after a pause, 
 and a mournful cloud overcast his countenance ; " I have 
 done with the prevailing harmony of lovers ; I have 
 done with sounds, that flow betwixt the uttering and the 
 listening heart, to live in this for ever. Once, indeed," 
 and the monk breathed a deep shivering sigh, given to 
 some period that was long past, while the solemn melan- 
 choly that pervaded his whole demeanour affected his 
 voice, and subdued its thrilling tones to an emphasis of 
 the most touching pathos — " Once, indeed, though 'tis 
 lono- aaone since, I thought differently ! Nevertheless," 
 he added, with a determined effort to recover his com- 
 posure, in which he partially succeeded, " if I can help 
 vour suit, I'll do the most I can. Who is the lady ? — 
 let me know her rank." 
 
 •• Bv vour leave I will describe her, so thou shah 
 better judsre," returned the other : — " She is like a 
 Princelv Bird, and is alone ! Her nest is ripe pearl 
 blossoms, twined to wreaths for her to lie in, and 'tis 
 emparadised on a strange promontory of exquisite red 
 rubies, pointed in heaven, but loosed from veins of the 
 earth, in drops, like blood; and round about her crested 
 aerie, columns of diamond and ethereal sapphire lift up 
 and paint the beams, they tempt from above. Valueless 
 stones, hewn from steep rocks with danger, and un- 
 iraao-ined cems, dug i' the heart of the majestic world, 
 wherein they hid, like precious thoughts, spread round 
 her eminent dwelling. Enshrined in a serene and ani- 
 mated atmosphere, which, proper to herself, arrays her 
 in its glorv, she changes the appearances of those 
 dazzlins: rays, which she rejects. Her wings are fea- 
 thered dreams, rosy with early morn, with which some- 
 times she'll sail aloft, buoyed by a troop of airy ac- 
 clamations, sustained and cushioned on the light cloud's

 bosom ; at others, heaving with whispers i' the firma- 
 ment, she'll float, lucid and motionless, close to the 
 bounds of the under world ; but never touches earth, 
 though paved with hearts to tread on." 
 
 A deeper and a deeper tint of paleness gathered over 
 the contracted features of the monk, as the count pro- 
 ceeded in his allegorical description, till, at the close, 
 his eyes became fixed, and his whole aspect had in it 
 something cadaverous and sepulchral. " What figure 
 is this ?" said he, at last, with the forced composure of 
 a man, who deprecates his inward agitation becomiiiiT 
 manifest. 
 
 '* Tis a likeness of fancy," returned Count Ragotzy, 
 carelessly ; " but how, think you, may I rob this nest. 
 and own that Royal Bird ? — do you agree ?" 
 
 '* I agree I" repeated the monk, faintly. 
 
 ** Ay," said the count, " you understand me ; — I 
 would adventure this coy and excellent creature — am- 
 bition such as mine may be her suitor." 
 
 *' It is not well," rejoined the other, after a short 
 pause, in a deep low voice, whose singular calmness of 
 enunciation sounded almost preternatural : " It is not 
 well, I say. to aim at a thing so difficult ; — you have 
 not let your eye stab your heart's hopes ? But I'm no 
 (Edipus to see through shadows, and you as yet speak 
 parables." 
 
 " Then, in a word, you must decide whether or not 
 I am to wear this trophy on my bosom, since she is mine 
 if you will lend a syllable," replied the count. 
 
 " I ?" ejaculated the monk, through his pallid com- 
 pressed lips, in a tone of strong, yet half-suppressed 
 emotion. 
 
 " It rests with you, you know," said the other. 
 
 Father Dominick drew nearer to the count ; a conflict 
 of many passions, as indescribable as violent, raged in 
 his bosom ; his eyes for a moment seemed fixed with a 
 ghastly glare on the moon, whose light streamed wanlv

 on his wild countenance, but they saw nothing ; — the 
 next instant he drew his cowl more completely over his 
 face, and, after clenching his hands tightly, thrust his 
 open right palm within the folds of his large coarse 
 habit, — the loose drapery became agitated with the con- 
 vulsive movement. By and by he drew his hand forth, 
 and, as he raised it in the air, the cold ray from above 
 glittered upon a naked blade, which he held right against 
 the back of Ragotzy, while with his teeth set, and every 
 limb convulsing with suppressed emotion, he exclaimed, 
 " With me ? To whom, sir, is it you allude ? Who is the 
 lady?" 
 
 *' She, whom men call queen. Do you understand 
 me now? — the daughter, sir, as we are told, of the late 
 King John and the Queen Isabella," answered the 
 chieftain, with resolved mien and dauntless voice. 
 
 Father Dominick approached two steps nearer the 
 daring Cygani, and grinding his teeth against each other, 
 with an accent, low pitched indeed, but as dreadfully 
 emphatic as the dagger's point which glanced in the 
 moonshine, shrieked in the bandit's ear, "Whom, villain, 
 mean you ? " 
 
 "The Lady Czerina," answered Ragotzy, firmly : "if 
 I wed her not " — 
 
 "Murderer, silence!" burst in the almost maniac con- 
 fessor, at the full pitch of his thundering voice. As 
 he spoke, his lips became horridly blanched with the 
 excess of his emotion, and his eyes seemed literally to 
 start from their sockets, " What, thou !" continued the 
 monk in a volley of wrath; "thou! for whom the 
 coarse wanton, serving by indenture the uses of the 
 common hangman, had she the breath and being of 
 humanity not totally defaced, were too good a mate, 
 thou dare to raise thy presumptuous thoughts to her, 
 who is, — the Queen of Hungary ! Hast thou a working

 carnate ? Something of this I was led to suspect from

 hear that from those perjured lips, which it would be- 
 come me, in no point of view, to brook or pardon, but I 
 might not guess to what extremity you would be wrought 
 by your disordered senses. Mark me, rash fool ! — did I 
 not reckon you drunk, or nigh to death — delirious ; by 
 the myriad eyes of the God above us, I'd strike you 
 dumb at my feet!" 
 
 " Rail on ; it shakes not me, altliough 'tis pity so 
 much good brawling should be thrown away," returned 
 the iron-nerved chieftain, with coolness, and smiling 
 grimly : ''nor, I ween, would you deem it politic to ha- 
 rangue so loudly, w^ere we now, instead of standing 
 on this heath, met in the presence-chamber of Queen 
 Isabella and Cardinal Martinuzzi. His eminence, not- 
 withstanding his weight of character and influence, would 
 find all impotent, I suspect, to hinder justice shaK.ing

 sheriff,^ the vessel of this state lies tossing to and fro, 
 beneath the dark brows of these Cyanean rocks. f One 
 measure alone can avert Transylvania being crushed in 
 the collision of the mighty potentates. Peter of Molda- 
 via, by command of the sultan, hovers even now in 
 martial array upon the borders. With that waivode I, 
 sir, — I, as the leader of the Cyganis, have formed a fe- 
 derative alliance Peter, beyond controul of his lord 
 paramount, will only act (as you have cause to know) 
 as suits his interests ; those interests, influenced by a 
 Cygani maid, whom I have given him for chamber pas- 
 time, are the same as mine. Most of the Wallachian 
 bands, heretofore under the command of Peter are incor- 
 porated into one body, and, with the Moldavian force I 
 before spoke of, will march when and where I dictate. 
 Of all the Wallachian chiefs only one acts independently 
 of Peter and myself, — the young Richter Iwan. What 
 that richter's purposes may be, I cannot even guess, 
 only it is certain, that, for the last few months he has 
 been extraordinarily active in recruiting his force, — but 
 that is from the point. Now, without moving a single

 our scattered people, but merely by using the powers 
 entrusted to me by the Moldavian waivode, I can com- 
 mand the destinies of Hungary, — ay, the lord regent 
 himself must quail to Alaric Polgar, unless you, sir, find 
 means to induce him to accede to my terms. The wai- 
 vode of Moldavia shall betray either of these mighty ar- 
 maments, — which Martinuzzi pleases, into his hands. It 
 is indifferent to the renegade Peter, whether the Cross 
 or the Crescent vail its glory, — with the power that re- 
 mains, the regent may deal as he thinks fit, — and he is 
 not the man, or I am much mistaken, to let an advan- 
 tage slip by him. Now to the point, — I require no other 
 guerdon, for preserving for the head of the Lady Czerina 
 the heaven -wrought coronet of Hungary, which yet she 
 hath not in her own custody, nor," — and the bandit 
 smiled mysteriously, — " perhaps ever will have. I merely 
 require, I say, the hand of the Lady Czerina." 
 
 Here the brigand paused, as if waiting an answer. 
 What slight accidents, what hair-breadth scapes make 
 the wires which influence and regulate the machinery of 
 our fate ! Once and again, during the above, the monk 
 betrayed an intention to interrupt, but he restrained him- 
 self, and towards the conclusion, slowly and unnoticed, 
 he replaced the dagger within the folds of his habit. 
 Little did Count Ragotzy imagine, by how frail a tenure 
 he held his life that hour. After a long pause, in which 
 the monk seemed to muse deeply, he broke silence. 
 
 ** Is Unna acquainted with your visit to Hermanstadt ?" 
 he said, — " with your proposals?" 
 
 '* No," replied Ragotzy; ''when I resolved on this 
 matter, my mother was absent on one of her usual flitting 
 expeditions." 
 
 " And how, if I do not see cause to accept your ex- 
 acting conditions? What follows? What am I to look to 
 as the alternative ?" demanded the monk.

 Father Dominick were the same as his death warrant ; 
 and the Lady Czerina," — he stopped, and then subjoined 
 in a more low and inward voice — '' she may perchance 
 ascend a scaffold in lieu of a throne." 
 
 The cheek of the monk grew even more ashy pale for 
 a passing moment, but quickly resumed its previous hue. 
 The expression was succeeded by an indignant and wi- 
 thering glance of the eye: that too passed away; but 
 still there remained some secret inward emotion, as shud- 
 dering, he made answer — " Hah? Is it even so? Some- 
 times Count Ragotzy," he added, after a pause, and his 
 words came couched in a half whisper, whilst a myste- 
 rious and boding smile curved his livid lip; " men dream 
 not what they are about, elancing words, which, like the 
 scorpion's arrow, smite their own breasts, and are but 
 little instruments, — yet say," he proceeded in at once a 
 more audible, and more natural key — ** say, I were dis- 
 posed to rely on this you buzz into my head ; what war- 
 rant have I for your fidelity?" 
 
 " Why, in respect of keeping treaty with you," an- 
 swered Ragotzy, *' I pledge my honour." 
 
 *'Your honour !" repeated the monk, and a scornful 
 smile curled his lip : " See you, Alaric, yon gnarled and 
 stunted pine ?" and he directed the attention of his com- 
 panion to a low tree that had thurst its twisted roots 
 into the rifts and fissures of the rock. 
 
 *' And what of that?" said the other, suffering his 
 looks to light on the knotty complication. 
 
 "Such is your honour," cried the monk; "'tis wi- 
 thered, sir, withered root and branch ! Prithee throw 
 something more than mere breath to incline the balance, 
 lest thy pledge kick the beam." 
 
 " Well then," replied the chieftain; "say I commit 
 my person into your hands, — to-morrow at noon I will 
 present myself before the council to be held at that hour 
 by the lord regent; and what you shall in the mean 
 time prescribe, will I then publicly deliver. Moreover,

 every iota I stipulate. Does that content you V 
 
 '* Albeit, I am not apt for this to night, we will can- 
 vass it hereafter," said Father Dominick abruptly: — 
 *' 'Tis an affair," he presently subjoined, '' of too great 
 importance to be suddenly concluded; we can, I say,' 
 confer privately another time ; however, at present you 
 require repose, — surely it cannot be, you intend remain- 
 ing without the walls till day-break?" 
 
 " You cannot be ignorant," replied the count, after a 
 moment's hesitation ; " that time calls for instant deci- 
 sion, and you are not wont to lose the advantage of the 
 game for lack of promptitude. In every w^ay hath for- 
 tune armed me, nor will I neglect to use her prevailing 
 weapons. I repeat, in my hands rests the prosperity or 
 downfall of these countries ; but I will not barter the 
 precious spell I hold over their destiny, for any price 
 below the hand of the Lady Czerina. Nay, more, you 
 have the present means to marry me also to her condi- 
 tion ; — no reflected empire for me! I must and will 
 possess the greatest of the deities, positive regal power;* 
 not borrowed, sir, not borrowed, but that which stands 
 on its proper basis — my own absolute will. This, if you 
 deny me, understand, I shall make small scruple, spite 
 of Unna's mandate contrariwise, to help myself out of 
 your fortunes — and your fame. Touching my accompany- 
 ing you at this hour to Hermanstadt ; if so, shall I be in

 "^ You will not be under my surveillance," answered 
 the priest scornfully. 
 
 " Nor, T trust, will the wretched curs of office, the 
 palatini canes, be allowed to bay at me on account of 
 certain transactions you wot of?" urged the other, bend- 
 ing his dark and penetrating glance on the holy confessor."

 as to all that's past, shall be observed twixt thee and jus- 
 tice, during your sojourn at Hermanstadt." 
 
 "Then [ attend you," said the count; and Father 
 Dominick led the way down a narrow and abrupt de- 
 scent, intermingled and obscured with rock and tangled 
 brushwood, and but partially dappled, and enlightened 
 by the erratic glimmerings of the moon; at the gorge of 
 this rugged defile, a low postern gate, covered with 
 thickly matted ivy, admitted them into a long dark dreary 
 cavern. This eventually led to a stone staircase, termi- 
 nating in one of the small square towers that studded the 
 wall of the battlement, and which formed a kind of bar- 
 bacan, whence a narrow door gave them access to the 
 ramparts; but one other observation passed between the 
 monk and his champion, ere they reached the castle. 
 
 '* Where do you propose to lodge me?" inquired the 
 count. 
 
 "Id my own suite of apartments," answered the monk. 
 
 " The north turret?" rejoined the other, 
 
 " I presume you can have no objection to take up 
 with your former quarters?" said Father Dominick. 
 
 ♦' None, whatever," replied the Cygani leader, with an 
 air of savage exultation, whilst a fearful radiance, that 
 might be likened to a flickering fire at night-time, lit up 
 his eyes, as for an instant, they gleamed out through the 
 raven locks, with fierce and demoniac joy — " Oh ! none 
 whatever!" and at the word, the two passed into the ci- 
 tadel of Hermanstadt.

 The tenor of our tale carries us back to Hubert, who, 
 after having received the packet from Count Ragotzy, 
 forthwith hied him to the esplanade. He thence dis- 
 missed to their quarters the corps de garde, and rejoined 
 the subaltern on the ramparts. The countenance of the 
 poor fellow had hardly recovered the natural rubric, 
 which the apparition of armed men had so lately chased 
 away. Motioning the soldier of the watch to draw close 
 up to his side, Hubert proceeded to address him in a 
 confidential tone. " How is this, Yosa,* he said, ''what 
 terrifies you, man ?" 
 
 " Why," returned the soldier, " how can flesh and 
 blood help being terrified at having to encounter the oc- 
 cupants of the grave — but Christ save us! egress from 
 the city after dusk is prohibited, and I marvel how the 
 holy father passed without the walls." 
 
 " Why you only came to Hermanstadt with our last 
 recruits," returned the other, " else you would have 
 known, that by orders of the regent, the wishes of his 
 €onfessor are to be obeyed to the letter, by every indivi-

 dual in the city. No one knows whence comes this 
 ghostly father ; but men will talk, and there be strange 
 things bruited abroad. The suspicious circumstance of 
 the monk's invariably retaining his cowl so low over his 
 face as to hide his features, has afforded occasion for 
 considerable marvel ; men do give out," and the voice of 
 the speaker sunk into a most oracular whisper, " that he 
 you saw even now, is no better and no other than" — 
 here Hubert paused — *' than " 
 
 " Whom ?" demanded the sentry. 
 
 " The Walking Jew T was the reply. 
 
 "Now Holy Saint Mary forefendl" ejaculated the 
 other, crossing himself. 
 
 " Yea, there be evil tongues that do say as much," re- 
 joined the captain. 
 
 " Well, only think of that ! And his eminence to suffer 
 a rascally Jew to order about him in such like fashion— 
 What can be the cause ?" 
 
 ** 'Tis a perilous question, and one hard to answer, al- 
 though there are who make small scruple to propagate 
 their thoughts upon that head ; and, in good truth, the 
 only difference of opinion is, as to the extent of the holy 
 father's communication with the foul fiend." 
 
 " Is it possible ?" said the sentinel. 
 
 " Yea, I have heard it hinted that the reverend gentle- 
 man has his own reasons for never discovering his diabo- 
 lical countenance. You understand, I wis — " the sol- 
 dier here interposed : 
 
 " Now, St. Stephen and the Holy Mother be our

 of that ! but Holy Virgin ! what was it, captain, you had 
 the temerity to take charge of? — did I hear aright? — a 
 packet, I trow, to deliver to the queen ? The saints pre- 
 serve us ! to think of you being appointed the go-between

 of her Grace and the Evil One ! By'r Lady ! I would not 
 accept the office for the pope's absolution and benizen to 
 boot." 
 
 ^' Even as I suspected," muttered aside the officer. 
 '' Yosa," he said aloud, gravely turning to the supersti- 
 tious sentinel, *' I request the favour of you, that you will 
 not, for a few days to come, breathe a syllable of what 
 you have this night witnessed." 
 
 " Only to think of that !" returned the soldier ; " verily 
 I am more ready to oblige you herein, than you to require 
 my silence. I mean to forget the whole matter, please 
 the saints !" 
 
 *' Thanks, my friend," said Hubert ; ^' though it is but 
 a brief oblivion, I request of you; be Father Dominick of 
 human mould, or be he commissioned by the Evil One, 
 certes he holds authority in Hermanstadt, and so we were 
 better not publish this night's adventure." 
 
 The sentry, assuming the mien of one impressed with 
 the importance of his charge, silently assented, and Hu- 
 bert and he soon after parted. 
 
 The above information had been thrown out by Hubert 
 as a sort of bridle on the man's loquacity, for the follow- 
 ing day or two ; but the horrors he attributed to Father 
 Dominick were, nevertheless, universally credited in 
 Hermanstadt, at the time our story commences. The 
 research of the historian or the darker industry of the le- 
 gendary, would in vain attempt to pierce through that 
 atmosphere of moral pestilence, which the dubious, but 
 appalling sensation of terror, appertaining to the very 
 idea of the ghostly father, spread around him. 
 
 Excepting the regent, Martinuzzi, and Scipio, a negro, 
 his personal follower, not a soul was known at any time to 
 hold communication with the mysterious confessor. The 
 fact was, that few in Transylvania would have cared for 
 the world's wealth to exchange a syllable with one of so 
 inexplicable a bearing, and respecting whose close identity 
 with the incarnate enemy, such horrid suspicions were

 afloat. To every defamatory whisper superstition gave 
 ready currency ; much of what was repeated from mouth 
 to mouth could not be traced, and was, no doubt, mere 
 idle calumny, based upon very slender foundation : a 
 part — refuted by its own absurdity, must have been 
 absolutely false. No tale of terror can be devised which 
 will not find disseminators ready to embellish, with fresh 
 and aggravated tints, the marvel of the narrative. 
 
 This, perhaps, may tend to explain many of the ac- 
 counts of Father Dominick, which, although of a nature 
 far over-wild and improbable for the sober faith of la 
 raisonfroide, for a long period had been rife in Herman- 
 stadt. Yet, should it be objected that all these rumours 
 were void of foundation, we must demur to the motion. 
 Though calumny may amplify, she seldom invents ; even 
 lier v/ildest exaggerations have commonly some ground, 
 however ordinary and accidental, to go upon. 
 
 Wherever there is any considerable smoke, it usually 
 indicates a latent fire, however smouldered for a time by 
 the volume of its own exhalation. With the view of 
 elucidating the mystery of this man's existence, we 
 have winnowed but, as it were, from the sterile chaff 
 through which they are scattered, one or two incidents of 
 Father Dominick's life, which will scarcely be deemed 
 foreign to our story. Moreover, these having transpired, 
 subsequent to his arrival in the city, would appear to rest 
 upon better evidence than the generality of those horrible 
 passages, of which common report made him the hero- 
 To this extent we think it necessary to render the reader 
 as wise as were the good people of Hermanstadt ; not 
 that we absolutely pledge (as in other points) the w^hite 
 faith of our romantic muse to the dark and mysterious 
 transactions, at which we are about, with fear and trem- 
 bling:, to cast a retrospective glance, (however, inclined 
 ourselves to credit the wild legend,) but because those 
 spcciosa miro.cula, might not be omitted, without affect- 
 ing the even thread of our narrative. The ground we

 have chosen, hardly ascends indeed to the level of pro- 
 bability, and trembles, so to speak, under our feet; yet, 
 however singular and obscure these niaterials of our 
 legendary pen may read, that they should once have been 
 propagated and credited, confirms in the strongest man- 
 ner the detestable reputation of Father Dominick ; nor, in 
 our opinion, ought they to be rejected as apocryphal. 
 We were wrong to withhold our belief from the recital of 
 particulars, because they partake of that wild and mys- 
 terious character, w'hich is proper to the era and to the 
 country. Our relation, be it remembered, has been per- 
 petuated by a jealous and uniform tradition, and will be 
 found verified in the local records of that age. We learn 
 then, on referring to a legendary tale of Erdely, (copied 
 from certain MSS. in the Hungarian National Museum, 
 founded by the Graf Szechenyi in 1802 in Pesth,) that 
 on Martinuzzi's introducing the holy father to the capital 
 of Transylvania, and appointing him his confessor, he 
 assigned him a noble suite of rooms within the castle. 
 These were held sacred to his use, and that of his sable 
 follower; no other individual ever venturing to cross 
 their threshold. This suite was only separated from the 
 apartments of the regent, by a long oaken hall or gallery, 
 at one extremity of which two of the anti-chambers, com- 
 mon to both, served as a medium of mutual communica- 
 tion. The attendance of the Ethiop was highly conducive 
 to those feelings of awe and mystery, which surrounded 
 the ghostly father. The two were sometimes compared 
 to those ill-omened animals, unto whom the airs of 
 heaven and the blessed sunshine are said to be hateful — 
 neither was often to be met abroad, and never by anv 
 accident was the cowl of the monk thrown back from off 
 his head. However, for some months past, to the ex- 
 treme terror of the garrison, and the evident improvement 
 of its discipline, this mysterious man had nightly prome- 
 naded for several hours the ramparts of the city. 
 
 One morning, as it is related, shortly after that epoch when

 Hermanstadt became the seat of the royal house of Hun- 
 gary, the ladies Emilka and Antoinette, whose appointed 
 duty it was to attend upon the young queen, entered her 
 bed-chamber, according to custom, to awake her grace, 
 and do the requisite devoirs of her toilet. They were not 
 a little startled to find the room deserted, and their 
 astonishment became unbounded on observing, the royal 
 attire to remain precisely where, on being dismissed over 
 night, they had left it lying upon an ottoman. They 
 concluded, besides, from the state of the maiden's couch, 
 that it had been lain in only for a short period. The bed 
 linen appeared very slightly deranged, and all impression 
 of her delicate limbs was nearly obliterated. The queen- 
 mother was summoned ; the palace roused ; the whole 
 court thrown into an agony of tumult and alarm — the war 
 of anxious voices resounded on all sides — the tocsin rang 
 out its alarum peal over the city ; insurrectionary move- 
 ments followed — opinion was not slow in fixing on the 
 secret abettor, if not the author of the abduction 
 of the maiden. Rumour fluctuated from conjecture to 
 conjecture as to the how and wherefore, but the lord 
 regent was the centre about which she revolved. 
 
 It was clearly his policy to remove the heir of the house 
 of Zapola, and the act was exclaimed against, as the cruel 
 precaution of a tyrant, and the practical argument of an 
 usurper. Martinuzzi happened to be absent at the time, 
 on public business. Consternation reigned throughout 
 the day, and sad anxious night closed at length upon the 
 wrath and affright of the inhabitants of Hermanstadt. 
 Soon after the deep dead noon of that night, when still- 
 ness the most profound gathered over the fair palace, and 
 its inmates were either sunk in repose, perhaps dreaming 
 of their royal mistress, or else lay awake, wrapt in super- 
 stitious grief and terror, on account of her mysterious 
 disappearance, — even at that dread hour, suddenly, one 
 long and horrid cry, like unto that which erst resounded 
 in Egypt on her night of doom, roused every individual

 beneath the royal dome — all listened with a fearful fore- 
 boding of some dire calamity, and presently the soul- 
 harrowing- shriek was repeated. It seemed to issue from 
 the queen's bed-chamber — some few of the terror-stricken 
 hearers rushed thither. A marvel ! The royal maid was 
 sitting up in her bed — she had on her night-dress, whose 
 hue was exceeded in whiteness, by the livid and un- 
 natural paleness which possessed every feature. The 
 streaming gold of her dishevelled tresses flowed negli- 
 gently over her shoulders; a slight tear was visible on her 
 left breast, and streaks of blood stained her pure linen. 
 Her hand was pressed against her forehead, as if endea- 
 vouring to recollect what had past, and settle her dis- 
 ordered senses. Her streaming eyes glared widely and 
 inquiringly, with a sort of frantic eagerness, round the 
 apartment. One or two deep sighs succeeded, and she 
 sunk back on the pillow, closing her eyes, as if to shut 
 out some painful images. 
 
 Isabella directed all present to withdraw, and the 
 beautiful child was left alone with her mother. " What 
 means this, my love, inquired the queen regent?" 
 
 " Thank God, 'tis all a dream," answered Czerina, rais- 
 ing herself on the couch ; " but bless me with a word, do, 
 mother ! or else I cannot have screamed myself quite 
 awake." 
 
 **Czerina! my dear child!" said Isabella, with un- 
 wonted mildness of accent ; for little of that kindly 
 feeling, which commonly animates such close connexion, 
 was hers. 
 
 Our heroine put her hands to her eyes, as if to 
 assure herself they were not closed — then suddenly she 
 exclaimed, ''Ah, the bandage is removed ! Mother, I 
 dreamed I died, and I have in the grave beheld a beau- 
 teous vision ! but false, — oh, surely false ! — I would be 
 crowned, and shortly, though — send to the cardinal : I'll 
 confess to him." 
 
 " Him! whom?"

 ''Ha! I have hidden the writings from him — shall I 
 tell you their receptacle ? It is a coffin whose mouldering 
 planks, — but whisper it not to my guardian, or — oh, 
 God of mercy ! let me not go mad — I would be crowned 
 with the sacred diadem of St. Stephen, and shortly — say, 
 am I not queen of Hungary ? 
 
 "Surely, my love," answered Isabella. 
 
 "Ha! can angels speak untruths? Mother, what do 
 you think — I've seen his face — his face, I say, and God 
 save me from the remembrance. I must be crowned, and 
 shortly, though — oh Isabella ! queen regent of Hungary, 
 you little think what has been transacting — there are 
 things working in Hermanstadt, at which the graves of 
 the mighty dead have rent asunder, and given their 
 shadows up — pray my brain don't crack ! Send for the 
 cardinal, do — I would confess." 
 
 " My love, his eminence is at Coloswar," answered 
 Isabella. 
 
 " Why would you deceive me, lady ? — I know better, 
 my guardian is at this hour and minute within these 
 palace-walls, or I still dream." 
 
 " Will you speak to Father Dominick?" inquired her 
 mother. 
 
 " Speak to whom ?" shrieked the maiden. 
 
 " Father Dominick," repeated the queen. 
 
 Czerina replied not a word, but, covering her face 
 with both her hands, went off into a strong shuddering 
 fit. A considerable time elapsed ere the convulsion sub- 
 sided ; it induced a low nervous fever, which resisted, 
 for a period, all attempts to assuage it, and which did 
 not entirely leave her for many weeks. But nothing 
 could prevail upon our heroine afterwards to open her 
 lips on the mystery of her disappearance. To the most 
 earnest and touching inquiries, she simply and inva- 
 riably replied, " It was a dreadful dream ! — a dreadful 
 dream!" She did not seem to be conscious, that the 
 vision comprehended a revolution of four-and-twenty

 hours, or to understand how she could have been absent 
 from her couch for so long a period. And although she 
 commonly manifested a shrinking of the soul, a convul- 
 sive kind of terror, whenever this peculium, shut up in 
 her own bosom, was hinted at, she yet appeared to look 
 upon it merely as a dream ; and the record on her bo- 
 som bore witness to its horror, and attested with a bloody 
 seal the truth of her assertion. This was not all. The 
 city had no sooner been cheered with the glad tidings 
 of the queen's safety, than there was buzzed from ear 
 to ear a wild incredible story, which seemed to bear some 
 inscrutable connexion with the disappearance of her 
 grace, and which produced a gloomy and mysterious 
 impression on the public mind. The sentinel, whose 
 duty it was on that night to keep guard near the pre- 
 cipice, absented himself from his post, and continued to 
 be missing until the morning which followed the queen's 
 reappearance. On the dawn of that day, this man, with 
 a countenance haggard and highly excited, presented 
 himself at one of the flanking towers, which served as a 
 sort of barrack or guard-room, having been enlarged for 
 the residence of Martinuzzi's corps of mercenaries. At 
 first he refused to give any account of himself, or to ex- 
 plain the reason of his absence. However, on his com- 
 mander threatening to hand him over to the camp- 
 marshall, he offered to confess every thing, provided he 
 was sheltered from the wrath of certain parties, impli- 
 cated in the relation he had to make. This was ac- 
 ceded to. What follows is nearly a translation from a 
 parchment MS., professing to treat of this mystery. 
 Perhaps, in the opinion of the reader, it may reflect some 
 faint and broken rays of light on the dream and dis- 
 appearance of the Queen of Hungary. It is given in the 
 sentry's own words : — 
 
 " I had not been long lodged on my post, when, just 
 as the cathedral bell tolled the hour of midnight, my 
 eye caught sight, at some distance, of a gloomy shape,

 diffused of dew and ether, so lustrous and transparent, 
 that methought I could discern the outline of the crais: 
 through the faint appearance, as through a veil. Gra- 
 dually the figure darkened into substance, and, with a 
 mode of motion, which resembled gliding rather than 
 walking, descended towards the platform. I resolved 
 within myself not to be taken off my guard, and kept 
 my eye steadfastly fixed upon the strange intruder. The 
 hour was dark ; the moon had not risen ; and, under the 
 scowl of night, the plenitude of vapours was perfectly 
 star-proof. On this account I could not distinctly trace 
 the advance of the figure. It came on nevertheless, and 
 I watched its progress with sensations of awe and terror, 
 for which, at the time, I could assign no reasonable 
 cause, although I am now too well able to account for 
 themi The obscure shape found no obstacle in steep or 
 rock, but glided by the jutting barriers of nature, as if 
 it possessed the power to move in air. At length it lit 
 upon an elevated knoll that overhung the military sta- 
 tion where I had been posted. Then the shadowless 
 form made a pause - — ay, on the very edge of the giddy 
 height, bending to look down on me. I looked up at 
 it — I could do no more. A clammy dew gathered over 
 and tingled all my flesh ; for I was sure, from the time 
 of night, and the drapery of the shape, that some blood- 
 less villie* * at once a virgin and at once a bride,' 
 who could not rest in her grave, stood glaring at me. 
 I crossed myself, and would have repeated an ave, but 
 my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth ; so I remained 
 gazing at the apparition, as helpless and as purposeless 
 as the new-born babe. The horrible thing stared me 
 into statue. It looked all white — features, raiment, 
 all. After awhile she beckoned me. My ramping heart 
 
 * The Villies, according to Magyar superstition, are the ghosts of 
 maiden-brides, who, if they get a young man amongst them by moonlight, 
 incontinently cuddle him to death.

 Stuck in my throat, as 1 thought I should have to die of 
 her embrace. She called me, naming me by name ; and 
 bade me, would I hear tidings of a dear relative, to 
 follow her. This relative and I, in our early childhood, 
 were bosom comrades, and I yearned for some intelli- 
 gence whether he were living or dead ; — for we had 
 been long severed, and he, poor fellow ! has been lately 
 made a wanderer on the face of the earth for my crime ! 
 The spectre, stretching her hand with a motion, which 
 seemed to enjoin my following, passed soundlessly for- 
 ward. God, in whose hands the secret springs and mo- 
 tives of man's actions are locked up, only knows how it 
 came to pass, that I instinctively obeyed that horrible 
 sign. I hardly believe now, it was my deep anxiety to 
 learn some tidings of my relative, although I deemed at 
 the time, that such must have been my motive. Ah ! 
 surely I deceived myself; — it was not affection, but 
 supernatual impulse, which urged me on, since Heaven 
 knows, I would have given worlds, had I had them, only 
 to have placed those worlds betwixt me and that shock- 
 ing thing. I trembled, I shuddered in every limb; my 
 eyes strained themselves to gaze upon the apparition — 
 but I felt myself impelled to follow. A hideous phan- 
 tasma sat upon my breast ; — I knew it, but I could not 
 jostle it off. I traced the unincumbered spirit through 
 height and depth, over battlement and crag and preci- 
 pice, I believe by intuition, for I retain a very vague idea 
 of that midnight walk — a spell was on all my faculties. 
 I can only remember stopping ever and anon, for the 
 wier'd thing, as if woven of air, flew over the ground at 
 an amazing rate; and whenever I would rest, the white 
 creature, with more than human eagerness, again would 
 beckon me lo advance. At length I came to the yawning 
 mouth of that deep black pit, which sweeps steeply down 
 beneath the foundations of the city. Much that followed 
 is like a dream; the spectre beguiled me down steep and 
 tortuous passages, rudely hewn in the rock, till I found

 myself in a vast sepulchral chamber, the roof sculptured 
 with death's emblems, — brainless sculls, bones, and other 
 revolting relics of mortality, were ranged around, and 
 unnumbered coffins were deposited in marble recesses 
 along the dormitory walls. Here and there, a full length 
 skeleton stood beside his monument ; as if, impatient of 
 the tomb, he would anticipate his resurrection; a black 
 iron lamp, suspended from the raftered roof, cast a flar- 
 ing and ghastly glare, far worse than darkness, upon the 
 dismal abode of death. To all it gleamed upon, however, 
 I but little attended ; only one object transfixed my gaze, 
 and she was the unearthly being, who had lured me to 
 the spot. On her all the faculties of my soul rested with 
 undivisible interest. She seated herself upon an orna- 
 mental slab, raised about two feet from the basement, 
 whose entablature appeared highly wrought in living 
 sculpture. On the same monument, by her side, rested 
 a coffin; a hideous skeleton lay stretched at her feet; I 
 might not then discern her features, her veil floated over 
 her countenance, and about her form. Thus, like some 
 spectral effigy, she sat immovable for several minutes, I 
 all the time looking on. I would have stirred; I could 
 not. I would have spoken; my tongue forgot its office: 
 I could hardly be said to think. Whilst I yet remained 
 in this state of stupified horror, my ears caught the tink- 
 ling of a small bell at no great distance. The vision arose, 
 as if moved by mechanism, and uplifted the lid from the 
 coffin, and then, — oh! to my dying hour, I shall never 
 forget my consternation ! — the silent phantom crept back 
 into its hollow tenement, and drew the lid, so as to fasten 
 it on itself. I was now quite alone in the residence of 
 mouldering mortality. I can just recollect an over- 
 whelming desire I felt to escape from the terrors which 
 surrounded me, but that inclination was defeated by the 
 most hopeless impotency of mind and body. In the 
 meantime, my eyes, fixed in mental vacancy, must have 
 drunk in passively the impression of the ghostly shapes

 around. The first perception, which I can call to mind, 
 after the disappearance of the spectre, was sufficiently 
 startling. The space beyond the entrance of the vault 
 was sunk in shapeless and impenetrable darkness, and 
 the threshold itself was cast into shadow; but all at once, 
 my sight seemed, as it were, to grasp at something in that 
 direction. The faculties of my mind, floating between 
 vision and consciousness, very slowly became sensible 
 of the fact. Owing to the gloom, I could not at first de- 
 fine what I beheld; but by little and little I came fully 
 to understand, that my strained eyes, and the eyes of 
 some dark shape in the door-way, were reciprocally fixed, 
 and orlarino; on each other. The vacant orb recoiled, as 
 a strange living creature, tall, spare, and fantastically 
 habited, passed through the portal arch: whether it were 
 male or female, I might not at first discriminate. Its 
 epicene countenance was dark, withered, and indented 
 with deep furrows — its shrivelled lanky arms were bare. 
 The dishevelled hair was pendant in matted tresses about 
 the shoulders. In its right hand it extended a staff: it 
 spoke, and its voice sounded harsh and hollow, as from 
 the grave. — "Take up that coffin with care, and follow 
 me." — For a moment I hesitated, but only for a moment; 
 I seemed to consider myself bound to obey. 1 raised the 
 coffin; it was heavy; then the foul hag, having reached 
 the lamp down from the ceiling, passed onward with a 
 .gesture of lofty invitation. I followed, as if under a 
 charm; we proceeded through a labyrinth of subterrane- 
 ous passages, ascending and descending frequently flights 
 of steps, sometimes built of hewn stone, in some places 
 chiselled out of the living rock. We traversed dungeons 
 of wild and frightful aspect and of vast extent, wrought 
 out of the heart of the earth. At length a general lan- 
 guishing and faintness of spirits overcame me; I halted 
 to recover myself, and let the coffin rest upon the ground ; 
 my unknown guide moved on without a pause, and the 
 assemblage of horrors which environed me were wrapped

 in impervious gloom. Reptiles of unnatural and hellish 
 natures congregated round the narrow mansion of the 
 dead. The dismal screech owl, with hideous outcry, fled 
 deeper into the vault; the whizzing bat whistled through 
 my legs; and rats and mice, and such abhorred and un- 
 imaginable creatures, as are never heard of in the upper 
 world, crawled about me in every direction; so I thought 
 I would abide no longer in that spot of loathsomeness. 
 I essayed again, to uplift my allotted burden, when, in 
 the very act of squeezing unwittingly in my hand some 
 horrible abortion, which had nestled itself beside the 
 coffin, the disjointed prison-house burst asunder, and the 
 incarnate spirit of its single inhabitant, stood redeemed 
 and disenthralled, rending the casements of death, and 
 robbing the grave of its victory. I could not see the ap- 
 parition, the darkness was too profound; but, by that 
 unutterable creeping of the flesh when every pore, ting- 
 ling with distinct vitality, attests the vicinage of the 
 dead, I felt its presence, and knew it was at that instant 
 standing at my elbow. I would not stretch my arm, lest 
 I should touch its winding-sheet, the very thought of 
 which palsied me with terror. Presently a gleam of light, 
 that shot from an opposite direction, partially illumined 
 the duno^eon. I was mad enouo^h several times to cast a 
 furtive glance on the apparition. She was the spectre of 
 the precipice. Her veil, like a thin mist, must have 
 melted away, and I looked upon a loveliness " not of 
 this world." There, pale in immortal beauty, stood the 
 moveless form, fixing the intense and supernatural light 
 of her eyes upon me. Gradually, like the removal of one 
 layer of the thinnest gossamer after another, methought I 
 recollected who she was that stood beside me. Father of 
 heaven! how did I ever survive the shock of that mo- 
 ment? 'Twas the same lady, whom, several years ago, 
 in the forest of Belivar, I basely caused" * * * *

 ruption which ensued.] — It appears that at this moment 
 the word rememhcr, enunciated in a voice, hollow and 
 sepulchral as that which might have served an inhabi- 
 tant of the grave, sounded from the midst of the bye- 
 standers. There followed an awful silence of several 
 seconds. Then succeeded a deal of implication on one 
 side, and recrimination on the other; but, in the end, all 
 present were fain to admit the inexplicable fact, that the 
 word had not been voiced by any individual in com- 
 pany; it issued indeed, from " amongst them, but it was 
 not of them." A sound without an agent. Vox et prce- 
 terea nihil. The speech of tlie sentry faltered, his limbs 
 shook, and his tongue seemed to refuse his office, so that 
 the further hearing was necessarily adjourned. In the 
 meantime, these mysterious particulars, having been ru- 
 moured abroad, everywhere created a certain chill and 
 superstitious sensation. On resuming his communication 
 the following day, the sentry perceived that the room was 
 filled to crowding, and many of the conclave were citi- 
 zens of no little consequence. 
 
 At this point we again take up the manuscript. " My 
 recognition of the spectre so greatly shocked me," recom- 
 menced the sentinel, '' that I sunk down in a state of in- 
 sensibility. On reviving, I gazed fearfully around, under 
 the apprehension of having my eyes blasted with that 
 unearthly presentment ; but, in her place, they lit on 
 the ghastly form of one, whom I had reason to think an 
 abhorred ghost from the regions of the damned; of one, 
 whom, next to the Evil One himself, I apprehend, being 
 like him, subtle, terrible and bloody. With horror qui- 
 vering in every nerve, I gazed for a moment in doubt, 
 but I could not be mistaken — I saw it was the same. 
 My heart is full, and I must speak out. I threw myself 
 upon the justice of his highness, whose beams are uni- 
 versal as the sun's, whose goodness is an attribute co- 
 ordinate with his power. I appeal boldly to the laws of 
 Hungary, and the justice of my country shall shield me ; 
 I will bid defiance to this man's terrible menaces.

 Countrymen and comrades ! He, whom I awoke from 
 senselessness to look upon, was One, whom for years, 
 until that frightful moment, I had not encountered, and 
 whom, as I said, I believed to be no more. Till within 
 the last six months his scenters of human prey kept me 
 continually in view, and I duly received, at the hands of 
 one of these, fifty imperials, every quarter, to insure my 
 silence, and my remaining in Wallachia. The disconti- 
 nuance of that supply persuaded me of his death. But, 
 ah ! it was he, who yesterday snapped the thread of my 
 relation by the sound of his well-remembered voice, — even 
 the same who would have defended me from evermore re- 
 visiting this country ; who has sworn I should not long 
 survive the hour I set my foot on my native sjpil, — the 
 same, who once drew from me a tremendous vow not to 
 
 reveal to a single Ha ! great God ! Friends, rally 
 
 round me ! Look ! there glares the visage of the living 
 traitor ! — there ! there !" 
 
 As the prisoner thus spoke, he would have singled 
 out, with unsteady finger, some one at the extremity 
 of the chamber, and there ensued a general stir and 
 commotion of the compact mass which fronted him. 
 From the eagerness common to all, not to amit a sylla- 
 ble of the " ghost story," the conclave of citizens 
 had wedged themselves in close and silent array con- 
 tiguous to the narrator. Those nearest found their ranks 
 invaded, and themselves urged forward, by persons im- 
 mediately behind, and such as were left in the rear, 
 perhaps from having arrived too late, jostled hard for 
 room, trusting, in their turn, by dint of sundry elbow- 
 ings and manoeuvres, in some sort to better their situa- 
 tion ; so that, notwithstanding the dense and crowded state 
 of the apartment, this concurrent and impatient pressure 
 towards one point, as to a common goal, soon left a va- 
 cant space betwixt the extreme rank and the wainscoat. 
 It was thither the prisoner had pointed ; but in the gene- 
 ral erment, the individual indicated by the gesture,

 effected his retreat, without being discovered. Again, 
 with silence and suppressed breath, the assemblage ga- 
 thered round the sentry. [We return to the manuscript.] 
 " In a niche of the dark cloister," proceeded the 
 narrator, in a lowered voice, " a darkened lamp had 
 been posited, that threw the corner of the dungeon, 
 where I had sunk down, into a deepness of shade 
 so great, as to render me almost completely invisible. 
 The man, I mentioned, was standing near the entrance. 
 His coarse monastic raiment was belted in by a rope, 
 to which was suspended a large leaden crucifix ; 
 the cowl having been thrown back, displayed the monk- 
 ish tonsure. In a low tone, this person communed with 
 himself — 'Strange!' he murmured, 'I trust there has 
 been no error — Unna, where art thou V 
 
 " ' What would you with her, you name V demanded 
 some one, in a deep guttural voice, which, in spite of its 
 harshness, bore the accents of a female ; and at the 
 word, the same uncouth being, who had impelled me to 
 convey the coffin from the cemetery, stalked back, repeat- 
 ing in, as I thought, a fierce and commanding tone, — 
 ' What would you with Unna?' Her tangled hair hung 
 around her in elfin locks, and her manner and appear- 
 ance might have suggested the visible presence of Hecate, 
 in the act of inspiration. 
 
 " 'Have you secured the child?' demanded the monk. 
 " 'The child !' echoed the other, ' Oh! ay, the dainty 
 marigold ; I had her fast but now, close and pent up, 
 like death ; her kingdom is a goodly heritage ; yet, for all 
 her spacious realm, a small continent will hold her; she's 
 robed in pall, but not of sceptered purple. My eyes,' 
 proceeded the speaker, after a pause, with deep pathos of 
 tone, ' whose melting source, seamed with so many years 
 of hard obstruction, hath been a niggard to my outcast 
 state, when they beheld her laid in her narrow bourne, 
 looking so pure and pale, wept for her, and, in the bitter- 
 ness of my soul, I said, wherefore should I weep? better

 Methinks I'd rather see thee in thy shroud, than in thy

 there was a time indeed,' said the monk ; ' but where

 wish, and I well know thy pitiful nature ; but, remember, 
 whenever thou art about to draw destruction on thy 
 head, by promulging this matter, whom thou wilt involve 
 in thine own ruin — Beatrice and me, and her. Let the 
 child reign in peace. Her sceptre will be a frail reed in 
 a frailer hand ; and will break at the instant it is ex- 
 erted,' said the monk. 
 
 " 'But thy arm shall instruct her how to wield it,' re- 
 plied Unna, ' and why should she not govern in right of 
 her father V 
 
 "'That which you have done, I cannot undo,' re- 
 joined the monk, evasively, ' and if I might, it would 
 now answer no good purpose ; you have heard of Count 
 Rodna's murder, and know the dreadful consequence of 
 that fatal tragedy. It is now too late. Alicia Svvartz, 
 too, is in heaven !' and, having thus spoken, the monk 
 groaned audibly. 
 
 " 'What ! if he were there with her V demanded Unna. 
 
 "'No, no;' rejoined the monk, ' I do not like thy

 thought ; I would not hurt a hair of that injured head 
 even to benefit her. His appearance has a savour of bit- 
 terness unto me, even as a guilty conscience, to remind 
 me ! No more, Unna !' he presently added, * my appre- 
 hensions point elsewhere.' 
 
 " *To whom V said Unna. 
 
 ^' 'The brigand !' answered the monk. 
 
 *' ' Alas ! 1 trust otherwise,' said Unna, in a broken 
 voice : ' I trust otherwise.' 
 
 '' ' His swoln audacity, that makes him fancy all thing* 
 v.'ithin his fathom, will be his ruin,' rejoined the monk. 
 ' His violent humours border on insanity, towards which 
 restraint and fetters may be kindness ; any longer conti- 
 nuance of his insults and menace, in regard to that mat- 
 ter, must relax the sinews of authority ; and, if they do 
 not speedily terminate, by the Lord that lives I I will 
 proclaim him for that he is !' 
 
 '' ' What would you, tyrant?' shrieked Unna. 
 
 ** ' Call upon Authority to wield her sword to cut the 
 offender off,' replied the monk, with solemn energy. 
 
 " ' Then may the malisons of his mother overtake you !' 
 quickly rejoined Unna. ' May they — and curses such 
 as mine will go direct to heaven, and have a supernatural 
 potency — may they overtake, and cling, and cling 
 unto you, and drag you down to hell !' 
 
 '' The tall harsh form of the speaker grew taller, while 
 venting this imprecation, and her dark features bore an 
 imprint, corresponding to its dreadful purport. 
 
 " ' Nay, nay,' returned the monk, suddenly lowering 
 his tone to one more soothing, ' it may not come to 
 death. You should remember, I have higher obligations, 
 and ties, which are more binding, and to which I must 
 sacrifice those, which would otherwise lead me, for thy 
 sake, to overlook the brigand's preposterous insolence, — 
 make him understand this, or, else, — the Titan must be 
 chained.' 
 
 " Unnapreserved a gloomy silence, and the monk shortly

 added, ' But you have not told me where the child is 
 deposited ; and the princess, where is she ? ' 
 
 " ' Where should she be ? ' retorted the other ; ' be- 
 cause your infatuation forced me to convey her hither, 
 should 1 detain her in these pestiferous receptacles of 
 putrid humanity, the resort of spirits foul and fallen ? — 
 Does she bear about with her a spell, think you, against 
 the viper's sting-, or is she ague-proof?' 
 
 *' ' I meant it not so,' answered the monk. 
 
 '^ Unna again spoke. 'Whither, I wonder, can that cra- 
 ven have strayed in the secret dark ? We had better 
 hence, or she, you love, may be engulphed in one of 
 those steep and deep abysses, which recede into the 
 bowels of the earth ; or else, entangled in the whirling- 
 pool, float on a watery bier.' 
 
 '' 'Ah ! ' shrieked the monk, ' what madness is this? — 
 Lead me, lest her innocent foot be already on the thresh- 
 hold next to heaven.' 
 
 "At that moment, a strong light flashed into the vault, 
 and a white robe was seen fluttering, in the further ex- 
 tremity of the same passage, by which I had entered. 
 An iron tread echoes the light foot fall which precedes 
 it. The monk stood mute and motionless, but Unna 
 rushed out of the vault. There followed a faint scream, 
 immediately succeeded by a clangous sound, as if one in 
 armour were suddenly stretched upon the earth, and a 
 figure, like that of an angel, came wandering by, with 
 dishevelled hair, and an apparent want of consciousness. 
 It was the spirit of the cemetery, but her shroud was 
 gone, and her clothing, torn and disordered in her flight, 
 hung from her, as it were, in irregular festoons, exposing 
 her person to the exhalations of the vault. The pale 
 thing laid her small palm upon her bosom, ' and glan- 
 cing shadows of the night played o'er the marmoreal 
 depth,' whence flowed the red blood, staining her scanty 
 raiment. As the monk advanced, the ethereal shape ut- 
 tered one piercing sljriek, and fled forward into the gloom

 beyond. The ecclesiastic, pushing past Unna as she 
 entered, with a hasty movement, seized the lamp; and 
 the next instant I again found myself in darkness and 
 solitude. I arose with difficulty, for mv limbs were 
 rigid, and an icy chillness benumbed my blood ; while 
 shaking off the multitudinous abominations, which hung 
 about me, like the tresses of the gorgon, I began to dread 
 having to linger out in those mephitic vaults my short 
 remnant of existence, with no prospect but to sleep with 
 the slime of toads, and feel, as the chill blank of an eter- 
 nal rest crept over me, the battening worm raven on his 
 horrid banquet, ere my heart's blood ceased to beat. 
 The idea was fraught with madness, yet it served to renew 
 the elasticity of my mind. I roused myself, and groping 
 along the gelid walls, passed through the entrance. 
 Dismissing every idea, but that of pressing onward, I 
 made my way slowly betwixt the two stone limits, which, 
 at either side, I might easily reach at arm's length. Me- 
 thought I discovered afar off a pale glow-worm light ; 
 thither I bent my steps, but as fast as I approached, it 
 appeared to me to recede. At length, on passing through 
 a narrow door-way, the light waxed fainter and fainter, 
 until its last luminous speck had disappeared. I had 
 already remained a minute without attempting to stir a 
 limb from the position, in which I had first halted, when 
 my ears were startled by a soft step, that sounded not far 
 distant. I feared, I m'ight be in the vicinity of the same 
 pale phantom, who seduced me from my post, to visit the 
 territory of her bodiless associates. The step approached, 
 and in a second or two more, a slight tap on my shoulder 
 almost assimilated me to the exanimate thing, I dreaded. 
 Half distrusting even my senses, I have no words to de- 
 pict my extreme horror, when I felt the icy finger of a 
 corpse laid on the stiflP and rigid hand, which hung by 
 my side ; I snatched it away from the unnatural touch. 
 For awhile, I could feel my very hair bristling on my 
 head. Soon, I heard the same soft step gradually recede

 on the ear, and to my inexpressible relief, the last faint 
 echo of the awful tread presently ceased. So soon as 
 my powerlessness of nerve permitted, I almost questioned 
 the reality of my impression, but again certain remem- 
 brances struck upon my heart. I recalled the features 
 of the spectre, and my feeble flickerings of courage wholly 
 died away within me. At this moment, my attention was 
 arrested, by the approach of some person with a light, the 
 gleam of which enabled me to discover, that I was in the 
 same cemetery, from whence I had first borne the coffin, 
 at the behest of Unna. I had hardly time to slink behind 
 the ample base of a mausoleum, when a man in armour 
 entered. His stature was tall, and port commanding, 
 black plumes nodded from his helmet, his visor was 
 down. Drawing forth a small bugle-horn from his side, 
 he blew a low blast. As the last note died in the echo of 
 those arched and sinuous passages, a body of men, 
 armed with long swords and carabines, rushed tumultu- 
 ously into the cemetery, through a narrow door, sunk 
 within the hollow of the wall, and almost concealed from 
 observation, by the heaps of death's heads, and other 
 emblems of mortality, that seemed purposely to have 
 been arranged about its threshold. The mailed chieftain 
 advancing, formed a prominent figure, in front of this 
 deep back-ground of spears and carabines. ' We will 
 pay these vaults a visit to-morrow,* he said, * when that 
 black devil, Scipio, shall not so easily escape our steel ; 
 so get ye gone from Hermanstadt at present, and wait 
 for me at St. Agatha. I will not tarry long.' 
 
 '* * Had I my will, count, I'd have this night fixed 
 with a rubrick in the calendar,' observed one of the 
 men, 'to commemorate your ill success, 'tis such a rarity.' 
 
 a 'Wurmser, where have you left Wolf ? ' asked the 
 chief. 
 
 *' ' We fear the dog has given us the slip ; he bore our 
 lamp away too,' answered Wurmser.

 chieftain ; ' the beast will be nothing the worse for a 
 night among these cloisters. But are ye all deaf? Am 
 I to bid you gone twice ? ' he suddenly demanded, 
 stamping with his armed heel, till the vault echoed and 
 re-echoed to the sound. The troop made a precipitate 
 retreat, and, with a loud clattering noise, closed the door 
 after them. At the same instant, that terrible man ap- 
 proached from the opposite side of the sepulchre. He 
 walked direct up to the chieftain, who appeared to anti- 
 cipate that his business concerned himself. 
 
 *' ' My lord,' began the monk, with an air of stern 
 reproval, *this last outrage of all laws, human and di- 
 vine, calls for exemplary comment. Why should I not 
 this instant give you up to justice? —misguided mis- 
 creant, wherefore not ? ' 
 
 '' ' Ha ! Is justice then, whom thou hast so long thyself 
 abused, become thy dull accomplice?' calmly retorted 
 the other. * Give nie up to justice indeed ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! 
 "What hinders rather that I instruct not justice in thy 
 reaching crimes ? What bids me withhold my tale of 
 wonder, from the multitude? Give me up to justice! 
 Why what doth debar me at once claiming thanks and 
 honours, due to the benefactor of my country ? ]Might I 
 not whisper in Isabella's ear ? or might I not, before as- 
 sembled crowds, where, seated on the very throne of jus- 
 tice, Martinuzzi sits, trumpet thy guilt ? Give me up to 
 justice !' 
 
 " 'You mistake, sir,' said the monk composedly ; ' there 
 are a thousand ways open to me, without myself appear- 
 ing in the matter. I have other terrible modes you little 
 dream of, to put a final period to your iniquitous pro- 
 ceedings : drive me not to resort to them. There be 
 emergencies, when right must be enforced by might, — 
 such things have been ere now.' 
 
 " ' They have,' returned the chieftain significantly. 
 
 " 'And may again, sir,' proceeded the monk, sternly.

 " *And may again, as you say,' reiterated the other, 
 with similar emphatic earnestness. 
 
 " ' Oh my son ! ' said the monk, with deep pathos, 
 ' have 1 not been all the world to you, the almoner, mo- 
 nitor, father ? More liberal than the winds ? What 
 under heaven is thine, and precious, of health or wealth, 
 of life or liberty, which I built not up in thee? How if I 
 resume these gifts? How, sir, if I pash and crumble my 
 own creation, as with a touch T might, to its original 
 atoms ? I have borne and forborne long,— do not compel 
 me to vindicate my tardy justice, or else your life, — but 
 do not, do not, do not ! ' 
 
 " ' I tell you,' replied the chieftain, * you cannot reach 
 me. I defy your utmost malice : — my mother has foretold 
 to me, that only one man will ever have power, for life or 
 death, over Alaric Polgar.' 
 
 " ' What man ?' said the monk. 
 
 " ' 'Tis a riddle of Dame Unna,' replied the chieftain with 
 a laugh, * which you may read if you can. — Him 
 should I avoid, says Unna, whom I shall have de- 
 prived of his two dearest rights, before he knew they 
 were his property. My life you see is charmed. Mention 
 some other mode of retribution, and I'll believe you.' 
 
 " ' Suppose I were to hand you over to the inquisition ?' 
 said the monk. 
 
 " ' I understand,' returned the other ; ' but yours, let 
 me warn you, m.ght prove a two-edged instrument, and 
 cut both ways.— Say I played booty, and confessed more 
 than the rack would have to answer for — more than ex- 
 actly suited Father Dominick.— What think you, in such 
 a case ? — Besides, I can appeal to the safeguard given to 
 Count Thomas Polgar, by the bishop of Funfkirchen, 
 and ratified by Ladislas, — on his death, by King Lewis — 
 when he fell, by Zapola, for some years, — and lastly, ay, 
 you may well start!— by Martinuzzi.' 
 
 " ' Son,' replied the monk, after a short pause, ' not-

 withstanding the safeguard you speak of, were I to lodge 
 you in prison, and you to linger there till the day of doom, 
 none would heed — none would require the person of 
 yourcountship at my hands.' 
 
 " 'Yes, one would,' coolly observed the chieftain. 
 
 '''Ha! whom ?' demanded the monk. 
 
 " ' The queen of the Cyganis,' replied the other, in the 
 same bold unsubdued tone, which he had hitherto used. 
 
 " There followed a momentary pause, which was broken 
 by the monk saying, ' Let me recal, my son, an event in 
 your early history, which seems, I know not how, to have 
 escaped your remembrance. Twenty years, and more 
 have passed over your head, since the day I would advert 
 to, but it is from that epoch, you have to date the com- 
 mencement of your fortunes. It was then, that your pale 
 light first twinkled on the verge of the horizon, which, 
 gradually broadening and brightening through darkness 
 and storm, hath long hung like ' a hostile prodigy,'* to 
 fright the under world ; but thy fires, which already are 
 almost spent, will have, at the last, to be raked up, like a 
 sparkle, and be trod out by justice.' His voice faltered 
 for an instant. The chieftain would have spoken, but 
 the monk immediately resumed, in a studiously modulated 
 tone ; ' It chanced in Belgrade, even at the time I have 
 named, that a fine boy of the age of ten years, was being 
 led one morning to execution by a body of Janissaries, 
 when a stranger, who happened to be passing through the 
 city, won, it may be, by the youth's gallant bearing, felt 
 interested for his fate. This stranger became solicitous 
 to learn, what crime, deserving death, could have been 
 committed, by so juvenile an offender. He was informed, 
 that the lad was one of a tribe of gipsies, who, on the 
 over-night, had broken into the dwelling of the Mufti, and 
 stripped the house of valuables to a considerable amount. 
 This boy alone had been captured ; he had been offered a

 pardon, on condition of his betraying the haunt of his 
 confederates, but preferred to die. — The stranger could 
 not sufficiently admire the magnanimity of the lad/' and 
 he determined to save him. Fearlessly encountering, and 
 surmounting every obstacle, arising from the forms of 
 justice, the prejudices of national antipathy and of reli- 
 gious hatred, he was eventually so happy, as to accom- 
 plish his purpose ; but it could only be effected by reim- 
 bursing the Mufti for the loss of his property, and after- 
 wards buying the freedom of the culprit, at an amazing 
 price. The sum required was equal to the revenue of a 
 prince, but the stranger counted out the gold in one scale, 
 and in the other reckoned the excellency of a human 
 life ; nay, as he trusted, of a human soul saved, and the 
 ingots were as dust in the balance. Now, tell me, sir, 
 should not this redemption of his existence have insured 
 the urchin's gratitude, whilst he continued to breathe the 
 vital air ? Would one suppose it to be in human nature, 
 that this boy could ever thereafter have done his utmost to 
 injure and trample on his benefactor?" 
 
 '* ' You strangely forget yourself,' said the chieftain, in 
 a scornful, but meaning voice, at the same time drawing 
 himself up into an attitude of insolent defiance ; ' I have 
 not hitherto done my utmost.' 
 
 " ' Peace, sir,' exclaimed the monk, ' and listen to me, 
 throughout, though not to a close ; for as yet, the end is 
 not — 'tis in the womb of time. The stranger took home 
 with him the manumised boy, whom he had snatched, 
 soul and body, as a * brand from the burning.' His heart 
 inclined towards him, and he clothed him, fed him, in- 
 structed him, lavished on him all the charities of father, 
 friend, preceptor, thus * heaping coals of fire on his head,' 
 should he turn ingrate. He did turn ingrate, sir, and all

 these benefits were writ in water. — Ah ! you had of me, 
 Ragotzy, health, wealth, distinction, — all you could have 
 — all that ranks you higher than deserving men. But 
 thou must come, forsooth, a base malignant spy. Like 
 the poisonous worm was stirred thy venom, only to 
 corrode the breast of pity and compassion, which warmed 
 and nestled thee, till by thy diffused malignity, the very 
 hand, which has been so prodigal in its gifts, withered 
 and shrunk. "With a felon's strength, didst thou rend the 
 lips of caskets, dread, like those, which lock the end of 
 all our deepest counsels. 
 
 ^' ' Unthankful man !' proceeded the monk, advancing a 
 step nearer to the chieftain, and speaking in a sterner tone : 
 " Thou peerest into the corners of my life, and didst 
 extort the treasures of my secret soul, — yea, count, one by 
 one, my inmost thoughts before thee, as since thou hast 
 told out the accursed coin, with which I have foolishly 
 requited thee. It had been a mercy hadst thou cut thy 
 way direct into my heart, with a quick steel, so I had 
 perished once, and felt not death dropping for ever from 
 thy perjured lips. What tempted thee ? ' 
 
 " The other mystically smiled and began : ' The sultan,' 
 but immediately the monk again took up the word, 'Oh! 
 he should have heard your tidings, and seen your pilfered 
 treasure; for he commanded, — bribed thee, /bid the most, 
 and yet the serpent knew thy value ; thou art nothing 
 worth, sir! what security could he repose in thee ? in a 
 servant, who had broken the full confidence of his lord 
 — in a subject, who set to sale his country's hopes — in a 
 man, whose dear integrity and common nature were worn, 
 like a robe, to rags ! Is it not vile V 
 
 There was uncommon dignity in the bearing of tiie 
 monk, during the delivery of this stern rebuke; but it 
 seemed to make no impression on the chieftain. 
 
 '^ ' I have done all this of course,' he returned Vv'ith a 
 sarcastic smile ; ' you've said as much before.' 
 
 " 'And you,' replied the holy father, ' heard me without

 a blush, as now I see you do. Yet, all this,' he continued, 
 'I would have pardoned — all, anything, everything, but 
 thy last act ! there wanted it not, God knows, to complete 
 the climax of your ingratitude, and yet it transcends the 
 amount of your other injuries a thousand-fold — to aim at a 
 life, to whose term that of thy benefactor is truly linked as 
 closely, as was ever feigned of Meleagar and the billet of 
 Alhea ! What devil prompted thee?' — He paused, fixing 
 on the chieftain a grave and searching glance. — His com- 
 panion laughed out scornfully, and the echoing sounds 
 rang through the sepulchres, like the scoffing of a demon. 
 " 'Thou wert not sane,' the monk rejoined, in a stern 
 and sustained tone of reprimand, majestic beyond des- 
 cription ; ' or, however steel'd thy heart, it is still human. 
 Yes, sir, 'twas stark staring madness possessed you ! But 
 even now, wherefore led you, your wretched myrmidons 
 into these vaults ? I know, you were about to slip the 
 leash, — where, sir, was the quarry ? ' 
 
 " ' That black traitor,' began the chief. 
 "' And what of him, sir?' interrupted the monk; *what 
 possible (see you that skeleton standing at your side ? 
 you'll one day be as it, Alaric !) inducement can you 
 have to stain your soul with that man's murder? Speak, 
 sir!' — At this instant my eyes were attracted by a sight, 
 which again filled them with horror. From that monu- 
 mental slab, on which the coffin had been originally laid, 
 a female head, and then her entire shape, seemed slowly 
 to issue, ascending as it were, out of the marble. She was 
 sheeted in the unsullied garments of the grave, and her 
 veil of thin gauze in many a fold, like fleecy clouds, 
 floated about her. Trembling, I watched the progress of 
 the vision; at first I doubted, but it was only for a mo- 
 ment. Oh, merciful Heaven ! I soon felt she was, — yes ! 
 the spectre of the precipice stood revealed before me ! 
 At the same time, the observation of Ragotzy and of 
 the monk became rivetted on the awful appearance. 
 A bitter sneer had escaped the lips of the former ; and he

 seemed to be meditating on some reply, when the inarti- 
 culate sound died away on his tongue, probably from ap- 
 prehension. 
 
 "The spectre beckoned the ghostly father : — to the best 
 of my belief that mysterious man advanced a step 
 towards her, though I may not state this for certain, 
 since to my increased dismay, the light of the lamp be- 
 came suddenly extinguished, and all the surrounding 
 horrible objects were plunged in their native gloom, — the 
 darkness which was of the tomb — the shadow of death. 
 At that instant a dreadful noise, like thunder, to which 
 many a subterraneous echo answered, resounded through 
 the vault : a door opened, and was shut with violence. 
 ' Be on your guard I' exclaimed a voice near me, which, 
 issuing suddenly from some one of the tombs around, 
 sounded in my ears supernaturally tremendous. ' An 
 intruder lurks in the sepulchre ! Over my chamber : at the 
 back of the cenotaph of John Zapola, king of Hungary 
 and Transylvania.' At that instant, a heavy blow pros- 
 trated me, and, between fear and stupefaction, the 
 powers of life were for a time suspended. 
 
 On awaking to sensation, I found myself in a vaulted 
 apartment, barricadoed with jealous strength. The door 
 was secured without, and the loop-holes, through which 
 already the first faint streaks of coming light began to peep, 
 were held by stanchions of iron. Oppressed with fetters, 
 which scarce permitted me to stir, I made a vain effort to 
 shuffle up and down the room, but soon desisting, I threw 
 myself in despair upon the stone floor of my prison. To- 
 wards the close of day I heard the bolts revolve, and one 
 bearing the garb and hue of an African, presented himself, 
 laden with a basket, containing some provisions, and a 
 cruise of water. I inquired of him the cause of my im- 
 prisonment ; he regarded me for a moment with a scruti- 
 nizing eye, and then abruptly named me by an appella- 
 tion, which, although mine by right, I had not gone by 
 since my boyhood. Before I could recover from my

 extreme astonishment, he had vanished, and I heard him 
 carefully shoot the bolts on the outside. Exhausted and 
 hopeless, I soon forgot my sorrows in the land of dreams. 
 My sleep was broken by a heavy hand pressed upon my 
 shoulder; I raised myself: the dusky grey of dawn had 
 again succeeded to the darkness. ' Bestir thee, thou 
 sluggish clod ! woulds't batten on thy duresse, that thou 
 liest here at thy ease, and slumberest away from sorrow?' 
 said a man, who was standing over me, in a harsh and 
 sullen tone. He was short in stature, but his form was 
 enveloped in a military cloak, and a mask effectually 
 concealed his visage. While speaking, he had knocked 
 off my shackles, and then added — ' Come with me; tread 
 lightly, and not a word, as thou valuest thy life/ He then 
 drew open a sliding panel of the wainscot, which cavity 
 a man might with difficulty pass. On issuing forth, we 
 stood on the landing of a flight of steep spiral stone steps, 
 which wound, with one descent, until they terminated in a 
 confined and dilapidated chamber. Having, with labouring 
 speed, arrived so far, I could discover no mode of egress, 
 until my guide suddenly opened a narrow iron-clenched 
 postern to the right, which had at first eluded my eye ; 
 and at the same time, by accident I believe, the mask 
 dropped from his face, and the red light streaming on 
 his countenance, I beheld the identical agent, who for 
 years had hovered about my goings, and was used to 
 bring me the quarterly payments from his employer. But 
 even at that instant, ere I was aware of his intention, he 
 thiiist me out of the room, and incontinently shut the 
 postern upon me. I found myself standing at the base 
 of the north tower, in the court-yard of the citadel. As 
 soon as I recovered from my surprise, at the extrusion to 
 which I had been so abruptly subjected, I directed my 
 steps hitherward, where I was immediately put under 
 arrest. I have nothing more to say." —

 incidentally alludes to a varying tradition, readily cre- 
 dited by the vulgar of every rank, that for more than 
 a century, subsequent to the period prescribed to our 
 story, two spirits, the one in monkish habiliments, and 
 the other a female, all arrayed in white, with her breast 
 dripping gore, would, during the deep and silence of the 
 night, traverse, hand in hand, a certain suite of rooms in 
 the castle of Hermanstadt. But since such a scope of 
 episode would divert us too long from the proper subject 
 of our labours, with which it hath little legitimate con- 
 nection, w^e shall forthwith proceed with our narrative.] 
 
 We are given to understand then, in a rare work to be 
 met with in the library of the museum at Hermanstadt, 
 which, by the way, contains many scarce and valuable 
 volumes, bequeathed by Baron Brukenthal to his coun- 
 trymen; that the account of the sentry wrought a terri- 
 ble impression on the minds of his hearers. And what 
 abundant excuse it furnished for sudden and strong ex- 
 citement! Ptumour forthwith found plenty to do for her 
 hundred several tongues, and every tongue made a se- 
 parate report. In the streets, on the ramparts, in the 
 near neighbourhood of the citadel, — every where, groups 
 of citizens might be seen collected with eager looks, ex- 
 changing the various versions of the mystery. And every 
 mouth, syllabling the awful sound in a half- whisper, w^as 
 big with the name of Father Dominick. Some said, 
 the African could be no other than the dreaded black 
 of the citadel. There was a spell in the idea, — no one 
 knew who first dared give it breath ; none might guess 
 whence the whisper arose: but, once disseminated, the 
 transition was easy to the crimination of the confessor of 
 their regent, — that mysterious being, around whom al- 
 ready there w^ere darkening suspicions of the most un- 
 hallowed description. 
 
 At length, a deputation of the principal inhabitants 
 waited upon Martinuzzi, and after recounting the marvel- 
 lous incidents of the sentry's relation, petitioned his emi-

 iience to silence the terrible conjectures, that were rife in 
 Hermanstadt, by deigning to institute some inquiry into 
 the inexplicable occurrence. 
 
 The regent's ready consent was obtained. He ap- 
 pointed the party to be brought before him on the follow- 
 ing day, and the better to ensure the ends of justice, 
 orders were given, that, in the interim, the sentinel should 
 be confined to the keep of Hermanstadt. The intense 
 sensation which this extraordinary affair produced was 
 wholly unprecedented ; and, impelled by the blind cre- 
 dulity of superstitious fear, the inhabitants of Herman- 
 stadt were stirring betimes on the next eventful morning. 
 At the tenth hour, Martinuzzi appeared, with extraordi- 
 nary pomp, in the great hall of the citadel, and attended 
 by his principal officers of state, took his seat upon the 
 throne. And now the regent dispatched a serjeant-at- 
 arms, with an order to the warder to produce his prisoner. 
 
 A mute and solemn agitation gradually pervaded the 
 chamber as, one after another, growing pale at the idea of 
 the investigation which impended, dropped the conversa- 
 tion, he was holding with his neighbour. The minds of 
 men were wrought upon in the awful silence that suc- 
 ceeded, until their very lives seemed bound up, in the 
 intense expectancy of the current hour. To use the em- 
 phatic quotation of one who was present : * " neque po- 
 puli aut plebis, ulla vox non tumultus non quies ;" and 
 lie might well have gone on from the same author, " quale 
 magni metus silentium est !'t Some delay arose. A 
 gentleman usher of his eminence was, at first, dispatched 
 to hasten the attendance of the sentry. Soon after, 
 the Graf Bathori, a young page of rank and note, left 
 the hall on a similar errand. A considerable space of 
 time again elapsed, but neither returned to render an ac- 
 count of his mission ; minute after minute rolled on, 
 while the court was still held in a state of intolerable ex-

 citement and solicitude. At length, a peremptory man- 
 date of Martinuzzi elicited the overwhelming' and well- 
 nigh incredible truth. Bathori returned, with perplexity and 
 discomposure in his countenance, accompanied by the 
 warder, who, in great trepidation, informed the regent that 
 the prisoner had escaped. This intelligence came like a 
 thunder-clap upon the senses of every soul in the court. 
 For awhile, they refused to yield credence to so astonish- 
 ing a statement, but it was too true ; the door, it seems, 
 had not been forced ; neither bolts were shotten, nor 
 bars withdrawn ; every safeguard remained in the morn- 
 ing, as it had been left overnight. The prison was secure 
 and unassailed, but where was the prisoner? Each man's 
 heart throbbed a reply, according as superstition or 
 doubt predominated ; but, on every bosom, a strange, 
 and hardly-defined sentiment of terror and dismay 
 weighed, like an incubus. The idea of carrying on the 
 investigation being of course abandoned, the crow'd dis- 
 persed to their several homes. 
 
 Days grew to weeks, and weeks were numbered into 
 months; and each hour, as it passed, stole something from 
 the intensity of the general horror, when a fresh incident 
 helped to renew the public excitement, and revived the 
 remembrance, which seemed ready to expire, of the mys- 
 terious goings on in the vaults of Hermanstadt. 
 
 A patrol of the city, happening, one day, to return 
 home by an unfrequented path, discovered the corpse of 
 a man lying in the fosse, just without the ramparts. He 
 caused the dead body to be conveyed to the barrier, hard 
 by — it was perfectly putrid; no lineaments of his face 
 were discernible. A noose, with the rope attached, was 
 left about the neck. The arms were lifted : the hands 
 clenched ; and the whole corpse stiffened in one dreadful 
 expression of agony. All seemed to indicate, that he had 
 come by his death unfairly ; but. Gracious Heaven ! the 
 deceased was habited in the uniform of the Hungarian 
 guard. Could it be possible? Ha ! vengeance had kept

 his word, and done his worst ! The unsightly spectacle 
 could be nothing else, than the foul and festering carcase 
 of the sentry, who was supposed to have escaped from 
 the keep, and who had never since been heard of. A 
 placard, found upon his person, put the fact beyond 
 all question. It bore the inscription which follows: — 
 " Citizens of Hermaiistadt ! behold the catastrophe of 
 that desperate slave, that canker-ivorm of faith ! take 
 warning by his fate. I, and one greater than I, have our 
 eyes on every soul of ye. Whosoever loves his life loill 
 keep his 07un counsel. Signed, SCIPIO." 
 
 We leave the reader to conceive the dismay, which sat 
 drooping, like an icicle, upon the spirits of all who came 
 to hear of this billet, each of whom might have exclaimed, 
 with Eve —

 The mind would fain pause, amidst the supernatural inci- 
 dents of the last chapter, with a longing desire to as- 
 certain their hidden springs and causes ; but, for the 
 present, at least, we must revert to the main subject of 
 our history, to the elucidation of which the foregoing ac- 
 count of the sentry is by no means unessential. We 
 wished, moreover, before we proceeded further, to show 
 how Father Dominick came to be held in so repulsive a 
 light ; and with that view, have quoted one, amongst 
 many, strange stories, to which we have had access, and 
 which were current at the period. We have been guided 
 in our selection, chiefly by the superior weight of evidence, 
 which seemed to attach to the tale of the cemetery. Had 
 we desired merely to excite terror, we had the choice of 
 several very remarkable passages of the ghostly father's 
 life, and reappearance after death, any one of which were, 
 perhaps, preferable, as a specimen of the marvellous. 
 But we would not attempt to remove the well-known land- 
 marks of truth. It were unworthy the genius of our his- 
 tory to deviate from her course, in quest of legendary lore,

 which, for the most part, must be wholly founded on fic- 
 tion. We are at liberty to make no excursions, without 
 the proper limits of our humble vocation, into so bound- 
 less a field. It is the office of our pages, to record only 
 what we deem authentic, and neither to place our own 
 conjectures and invention in the rank of facts, nor to 
 give currency to the speculations of others, " Nequid 
 falsi dicere audeamus." 
 
 Having premised so far, we beg leave to resume the 
 thread of our narrative, by reminding the courteous rea- 
 der, that we left the captain of the guard, some pages ago, 
 on his return homeward from the barrier. It was of the 
 last consequence to that individual, that his having held 
 communication without the wall of the city should not 
 transpire. Were it known, that he had received aught 
 from a state messenger, in trust for the queen regent, it 
 was evident, the deposits would be required at his hands. 
 
 Now there were dim motives of action floating in the 
 brain of Hubert, with which the reader will presently be 
 made acquainted, which made such an event especially to 
 be deprecated. He would have felt glad, certainly, if 
 there had not been a party to the transaction, but no li- 
 berty of choice was left to him ; the vicinage of another 
 was unavoidable, and it only remained to get the affair 
 hushed up, in the readiest mode that offered. The super- 
 stition of the soldier of the watch favoured his suit, and 
 Hubert felt satisfied, that, at all events, for the next day 
 or two, the man would not break troth. Beyond this 
 term, Hubert required not his silence. 
 
 With these ideas passing in his mind, the captain of the 
 guard retraversed the esplanade; and his meditative steps 
 awakened the still echoes of the ruinous causeway, con- 
 ducting to his own abode. How much of hazard had he 
 not incurred that night ! with the view, which he hardly 
 acknowledged to iiimself, of perpetrating a hideous moral 
 baseness, under pretence of abetting the designs of a man, 
 in whose power, prophecy, and circumstances had thrown

 him, but whom, from his soul, he abhorred. In the 
 downward path of life, which, for years, this man's pas- 
 sions and his errors had driven him to tread, his course 
 was taken out of his own direction. Every twig, he 
 madly clung to, in hopes of arresting the impulse of his 
 fall, only acted as a rebound, and tended to accelerate his 
 ultimate fate. Like that diver, in the Gulf of Charibdas, 
 spoken of by Brydone,* Hubert had leaped after the glit- 
 tering bait, sinking, at each venturous plunge, deeper 
 and more deep, into the abyss, till his earthly fortunes, and 
 his soul's health became alike implicated in the whirlpool. 
 With gloomy apprehensions for the event, Hubert 
 reached his rudely-thatched habitation, and, lost in 
 thought, paused for a moment beneath a sort of pent- 
 house, which, supported by wooden pillars, projected 
 from the roof, a few feet beyond the wall, in front. After 
 concealing the box and packet, in the folds of his military 
 cloak, he tapped at the low postern, which, at the first 
 summons, was opened, by a lovely young creature, whose 
 dazzling neck and bosom, partially betrayed by the light 
 and insufficient covering, with her minute and " many- 
 twinkling feet" flashing forth unsandalled, from beneath 
 a scanty night-rail, loosely thrown about her, proclaimed, 
 she had hastily arisen from her couch, for the purpose of 
 letting in her father. If time, and a course of vice had 
 left an isle of health and verdure, in the sterile waste of 
 Hubert's heart, that green oasis was the shrine and the 
 temple of this beloved being ; if one gleam of feeling 
 lingered in his bosom, over which the rack of misfortune 
 sunk not hopelessly dark, that feeling was exclusively 
 sanctified, by parental care and afTectionate solicitude for 
 his sweet girl, the sole offspring of his departed Vero- 
 nica. Oh, no! it was not for himself he repined: let 
 the tempest lift up and rage! he could stand its assault, 
 even as a fixed rock, which the constant surge chafes at,

 but wears not — let the shafts of fate speed 'gainst his 
 indurated front ! as from a steel garment would the 
 brittle instruments recoil — but when his thoughts, for a 
 moment, rested on that beloved one, he felt his spirit 
 languish, with his fortunes. In all else he w^as armed in 
 mail of proof. His desire of vengeance, he knew, would 
 uphold him in the everlasting conflict with his hard des- 
 tiny. He was like the hero of antiquity, impassable save 
 at a single indivisible point, but thither were the arrow 
 aimed, he knew, it must penetrate to the quick. If his 
 past sorrows told him not, his past sins might have, and 
 that emphatically, and unanswerably, that the bagnio floor 
 of this bad world was no resting-place for female inno- 
 cence ; its desolate and thorny haunts no pleasant asylum 
 for the probation of loveliness, whose only earthly trust 
 is treachery. Over the future destiny of his Veronica 
 would Hubert often weep bitter scalding tears — for her 
 sake, chiefly, he dragged on the lengthening chain of 
 existence — for her, the sweat of his brow was gathered, 
 and the sin of his soul contracted — for her he girded up 
 his soul in treason, living the confederate of robbers, and 
 the thrall of robbers, and their betrayer ! And that child, 
 not vet eighteen, with her radiant hair; her clear brow, 
 her eyes " of that same hue in which the heaven de- 
 lio-hts;"* her enchanting countenance ; her low silver- 
 stringed voice, entrancing the listening ear to catch the 
 minutest echo of that minstrelsy which, like the inspira- 
 tion of some soft reed pipe,t enriched the air when she 
 spoke; her graceful buoyant shape, just beginning to 
 round into the full and swelling contour of womanhood — 
 that child, whose every heart's throb was but the gushing 
 forth of that filial tenderness, which was " part and par- 
 cel" of her existence, and which constituted a worship

 and a religion, that not the most fervent enthusiast ever 
 went beyond, in prophetic cell or depth of solitude ; — 
 that child, the strong necessity of whose heart, without 
 reserve or doubt, and undiverted by the influence of any 
 lighter instinct, was love, in its most elevated character, 
 in its loveliest form and aspect — the intense essence of 
 that sympathy, which is among the best and most pious of 
 our human feelings, and which alone (as the oil of aroma 
 will preserve its entirety and sweetness, unpolluted by the 
 mire of the puddle, in which it may have spilt) the cor- 
 ruptions of this world have failed to deteriorate. Such 
 zeal of affection burnt, pure and exclusive, on the secret 
 altar of the heart of that child, who little imagined how 
 ' ;ly the perpetual course of crime, had hardened and 
 
 vered the nature of one, so highly reverenced. Yet, 
 despite his occasional shows of confidence, she appre- 
 hended, that her father owned certain arrieres pensees, 
 which he was unwilling to reveal. Many fortuitous cir- 
 cumstances, that could scarcely escape her penetration, 
 and obscure intimations from day to day, to which it was 
 impossible she could wholly close her eyes, had given 
 her to know, that Hubert's proceedings were not conso- 
 nant with that strict rule of moral rectitude, which her 
 unsophisticated sense, enlightened and hallowed by the 
 clear sunshine of theGospel, had chalked out, as the only 
 standard of human conduct ; nevertheless, she was far 
 from conjecturing how thoroughly unpurposed were the 
 impulses, on which her parent acted, or to how forlorn and 
 desperate a state his want of principle had reduced him. 
 She might hardly guess, that, like the bankrupt devotee 
 of the blind goddess, he had played on, through very 
 excitation of the game, and that, of late, he had lowered 
 and lowered the amount of his stake, until it reached its 
 minimum. 
 
 On the door opening, Hubert entered into a sort of 
 parlour, the walls of which were plastered and white- 
 washed, and whose large fire-place, with its culinary ap-

 pliances, betrayed the domestic uses, which the apart- 
 ment occasionally served. The single lattice of this 
 room was almost on a level with the thatched pentice 
 without, that seemed erected on purpose to eclipse the 
 day-light. Having doffed his iron beaver, Hubert placed 
 the packet and the box beside it, unperceived by Vero- 
 nica, on the rough table, over which he carelessly threw 
 the military cloak, and then drew a bench, close to the stone 
 hearth, whence the expiring embers of a dull wood fire, 
 cast a fitful and sullen gleam over the miserable accom- 
 modations of the room. On that bench, with his elbow 
 on his knee, his forehead resting on the palm of his right 
 hand, and his eyes fixed gloomily on the ground, Hubert 
 seated himself, and the very intensity of his gaze be- 
 trayed its lack of speculation, and showed how lost he was 
 within the sanctuary of his inner spirit. Veronica stood 
 by. She could not but feel hurt at Hubert's prolonged 
 silence, though neither his abstraction, nor its continu- 
 ance, could be said to surprise her. She guessed, that 
 those taciturn fits, to which he was of late accustomed, 
 did not result from internal repose, and instead of de- 
 noting a vacuum in his thoughts, she had reason to ap- 
 prehend, that they rather betokened the jaded restless- 
 ness of a brain, fraught with fearful subjects of contem- 
 plation. At length, she took courage, and ventured to 
 speak. 
 
 " Father, edts atyam,^ are you not well ?" she inquired, 
 with that thrilling emphasis of the heart, which alone 
 belongs to woman, and which only woman can conceive, 
 and give breath to. 
 
 " Well?" repeated Hubert, with an impatient start, 
 but without raising his eyes; — "Yes, yes, my love, 
 surely." — But Veronica apprehended something in his 
 looks and gesture, which contradicted this assurance. 
 His manner was like to that of a man, labouring m ith some

 dreadful conception. " Is there more krummolz at 
 hand ?" presently he demanded . Another faggot of knee- 
 wood was brought by Veronica, and thrown on the 
 hearth, and again all was still. The contemplation of 
 Hubert, which seemed to prohibit conversation, lasted 
 some minutes. At length Veronica, having, more than 
 once, suppressed what was rising to her lips, broke through 
 the restraint, by enquiring, in a low and timid accent, 
 into the nature of the alarm, which had drawn her father 
 from his quiet home, at that dead hour of the night. So 
 completely was Hubert pre-occupied, with the thoughts 
 then dominant in his mind, that Veronica had to repeat 
 her question, before he caught its purport; and, when he 
 did so, he briefly, and almost peevishly replied ; " Nothing 
 of moment, love, "—and again he fell into deep medita- 
 tion. Struck by the sullenness, with which Hubert re- 
 pulsed those attentions, he was wont to delight in, Ve- 
 ronica fell suddenly into silence, when presently, her 
 father himself broke the chilling pause, by abruptly ad- 
 dressing her. 
 
 '^ Prithee, my love," he said, " fetch me a stoup of our 
 kor'6 start.''* The damsel half started ; she gazed intently 
 on her sire, by the glimmering and inconstant light. His 
 countenance bore evidence of something wrong within. 
 It looked astonishingly pale; Veronica thought, she had 
 never before remarked it so pale. She felt troubled, and 
 appalled at she knew not what, and, throwing her taper 
 arm round Hubert's neck, she kissed his forehead, and 
 then, having dashed aside an involuntary tear (whilst her 
 feet glanced along the brick-floor, as lightly and as 
 brightly, as two trembling leaves of poplar, drifting be- 
 neath the moon), she glided from the apartment. She 
 was not long gone, ere she returned with the wine. 
 
 " Father, are we not to return to bed, to-night?" she 
 enquired, as she entered, with an arch smile, aad in a

 tone, that, notwithstanding its simplicity, carried with it 
 a somewhat dolorous impression, but instantly, with 
 more seriousness, she subjoined : " I am sure now, that 
 you are not in health, by your drinking, at such an hour; 
 that is," she quickly added, on remarking the increased 
 disquietude of Hubert's countenance, " I fear, you must 
 be ill!" 
 
 " I am as well as usual," coldly answered her father ; 
 and he raised the csutora* to his lips, and drained it at 
 a draught. 
 
 " Ah! I bethink me, now," continued the maiden, with 
 filial pertinacity, '' that dwarfish envoy, from Wallachia, 
 conferred such a time with you last evening. It must be 
 he, who has so ruffled you. I have often remarked, you 
 appear quite a different being, after these messages reach 
 you, from abroad; how heartily I wish, that all your fo- 
 reign connexions were abandoned, and that you would 
 learn to anchor your heart at home. It should be my 
 whole study to weave for you the fruitful hours into 
 a happy existence. Oh! believe me! I will scarcely lose 
 a section of a minute, in the livelong day, out of your dear 
 sight; and not a thorn hath untoward fortune planted in 
 your pillow, but I will find a spell to rob it of its sting. 
 Only do hold out some hopes, that, in time, you will seek 
 other counsel, than from designing men, that, like eclipses, 
 darken your path, my father: I hope I err; but do you 
 know, I dream of nights, there are, who will one day or 
 other, peril your life, if not, what you should prize more 
 highly, your character. But what is it ails thee, father?" 
 she asked, interrupting herself, as Hubert muttered some 
 inaudible words, between his teeth, while a strange, and 
 agonized expression went over the paleness of his features, 
 like a cloud. Alas! where were his thoughts? He was, 
 perhaps, reflecting how well founded were the apprehen- 
 sions, in which the maid indulged, and pondering on the

 possibility, in the desperate strait, into which he was 
 driven, of shaking off that baleful connexion, which, in his 
 heart, he deprecated, not less than did his child Discon- 
 certed and abashed, a cold shudder appeared to be passing- 
 over him, when, averting his face, his looks lit, half uncon- 
 sciously, on the unsandalled feet of Veronica. In a few 
 seconds, the whole of the dress, or rather disarray, in 
 which she was so lightly untrimmed, seemed to fill his 
 eye. 
 
 "Why, Veronica! how is this, that thou art so rarely 
 clad?'* he demanded, in a tone of reprehension ; " Prithee 
 retire, child, and apparel thee more warmly — but I give 
 thee but a minute; for Veronica," he added, with signi- 
 ficant impressiveness, " I have something to deliver, which 
 is not suited to the w^atchful day; and lo! if already the 
 night be not waning in the east, where the pale stars are 
 going out like glow-worms. Hasten back, then, child. 
 There is a thing to be done, ere the next new-day's sun is 
 
 in the heavens: a thing I , but wend thee, now, 
 
 away; no reply." 
 
 Veronica, not a little amazed, disappeared. While 
 the fair maiden was engaged in donning her body clothes, 
 Hubert removed the wooden case from the table, and 
 passed through the inner door, bearing with him the 
 deposit under his arm. He was not absent above a mi- 
 nute, ere he returned to the apartment, empty handed. 
 Casting an additional logon the hearth, he stirred up into 
 cheering life the crackling fuel, till the broad and ruddy 
 flame danced picturesquely, athwart the plastered wall, 
 and diffused its reddening hues, over the whole chamber. 
 Then, taking up the fatal packet, his hand trembled, 
 even like his heart, as he held it before him, to examine, 
 with greater minuteness, its form and appearance. It 
 was a small flat parcel, and even if he had had nothing 
 more to go upon, Hubert would have judged, from its 
 size and weight, that it contained papers. A triple 
 silken braid was passed round it, altaclied to three seals

 of rosin, severally impressed, with the bearings of Count 
 Ragotzy. In Hungary, at the age of our narrative, to 
 read or to write was held an uncommon accomplishment, 
 being an art almost exclusively monopolised by ecclesi- 
 astics, and chiefly confined to the peace and solitude of 
 the cloister. Hubert was consequently unable to decipher 
 the address. He turned the dread deposit repeatedly 
 in his hand, contemplating it on either side, and in 
 every aspect, as if he had hoped, by that mechanical 
 process, to discover some entrance, — some channel of 
 communication, between his own curiosity, and its con- 
 tents. In vain : it had been most carefully closed up, 
 and was sealed at every opening. He thought deeply, 
 and, as his mind darkened with its own suggestions, every 
 faculty of his soul became absorbed, in the vortex of his 
 desperate design. "Now, an I were wise, I might be quits 
 with fortune," he murmured to himself: " it is the same, 
 I'll swear, it is the same, and were the secret of these pa- 
 pers known to be in my possession, I might yet re-esta- 
 blish the golden pre-eminence of my birth, and secure, 
 and perpetuate the magic wand of wealth, in mine and 
 Veronica's grasp. What a harvest might I not reap, out 
 of the Queen's terrors ! I'd coin her nerves; her heart 
 were a mine exhaustless ; or, if I deceive myself, and I 
 may not wish that she, or any one, should know of my 
 discovery, let the worst betide, and I keep my own 
 counsel, who can betray me?" He paused, and then, 
 as conscience checked, added, in a suppressed voice, 
 *' Count Ragotzy ? But with him I am already impli- 
 cated : — Veronica ? Ah no ! not she indeed." 
 
 Silencing, by such fallacious reasoning as this, some 
 involuntary feelings of hesitancy and reluctance, he 
 paused, as, again and again, he inverted the position of 
 the packet, pressing it between his fingers, whilst he in- 
 spected every fold. The nervous consciousness of one, 
 who knows himself about to sacrifice his honour, and 
 self-esteem, to the busy fiend in his bosom, was stamped

 on every working furrow of his brow, and exhibited in 
 his abrupt and agitated movements. His extreme per- 
 turbation, evinced the wrestlings and throes of crime, 
 ere she is well delivered of her faltering purpose. His 
 internal conflict was made more evident every instant. 
 A trepidation shook him ; — he started continually, at the 
 sudden and tremulous gasps of his own breast ; he 
 pressed his hand on his knit and throbbing brow ; his 
 eyes deliberately made the circuit of the apartment, and 
 then again rested on the mysterious packet, in a sort of 
 feverish gaze, as though fixed there, by the power of a 
 charm. " Thou keepest my vision upon the stretch," he 
 murmured, addressing the object of his apparent curi- 
 osity : " would J could penetrate thy hidden principle. 
 To be given to Isabella, if the Cygani do not claim thee 
 of me. Ha ! by heavens ! it must be the same packet 1

 and deeper occurrents lie hidden in its folds, than I have 
 time to dream of. Fixed, voiceless confession," added 
 he, involuntarily speaking in a louder key, *' what are 
 thy intents — thy purposes ? what dost thou prate of? " 
 
 " Of danger and of death ! " whispered a hollow voice, 
 that hovered at his shoulder. 
 
 He cast his looks on each side of him, and behind, 
 but no human form met his baffled gaze. Not a little 
 startled, he cried out "Who speaks? — was that you, my 
 love ? " but Veronica answered not. After again scruti- 
 nising the apartment, he raised himself on the window- 
 seat to a level with the latticed casement, which looked 
 out, beyond the piatza, upon the narrow thoroughfare. It 
 was the dead hour of dawn, — the dew had not yet sprung 
 upwards with the lark. All was hushed, in deep and 
 grim repose, and the earliest Aurora still slept, on the 
 irregular, and uncouth mansions, on the portal towers, 
 temples, and battlements of the mute city. Hubert was 
 in no mood to look long abroad, on the beauty of the 
 night. Having descended, he paced the room in in-

 ward musing. That a voice had spoken, he felt con- 
 vinced, — horrible and unearthly as were the tones, still 
 a human voice it was, — and the words ^' of danger and 
 of death," whispered almost at his ear, were too dis- 
 tinctly wafted on the uttering air, for it to be possible his 
 senses could have deceived him ; and yet how could it 
 be ? Whence could the voice proceed ? 
 
 Hubert crossed himself, as he rapidly turned over in 
 his mind the simple topography of his humble dwelling. 
 Like most of the poorer habitations in Hermanstadt, the 
 only chambers were those on the basement story ; the 
 largest of these was connected, by a short passage, with 
 the apartment, in which Hubert was at the time, and con- 
 stituted a sort of kitchen, where, however, a wild crone 
 of a housekeeper was then reposing. Hence, there was 
 an outlet into a paved yard, once sheltered by a roof, 
 which, amissing the support of its wooden pillars, had long- 
 since disappeared ; it was now hardly enclosed by a dila- 
 pidated brick wall, so low in many places, as almost to 
 invite intruders. Beyond, extended a wild and ruinous 
 space, laid waste, and encumbered with heaps of rubbish, 
 and overgrown with tall rank grasses, intermingled with 
 briars, nettles, &c. This demesne had been partly inter- 
 sected with the foundations of buildings, newly laid, and 
 was partly covered over, by scarcely habitable tenements, 
 that, breached in several places, were left unrepaired, 
 after having been more than half demolished, from the 
 ravages of a siege, which the fortress had sustained, from 
 the Turks, some years previously. These mouldering pre- 
 cincts terminated in a deep moat, which, nearly on every 
 side, peninsula'd the massive donjon, or keep, attached to 
 the castle, or citadel of Hermanstadt, as the building was 
 indiscriminately called. The remaining apartments in 
 Hubert's house, were his own, and that of his daughter, 
 opening on opposite sides, from the central passage before 
 mentioned. 
 
 Hubert having considered these ichnographical points,

 thought it possible, that some person might have entered 
 the area alluded to, over the broken wall, and that the 
 voice might have issued, from that quarter. Acting upon 
 this idea, he made directly for the kitchen. A broken 
 partition of the wall admitted a dubious, and melancholy 
 light, by the secondary medium of a little window, over 
 nearly half of this miserable apartment ; the moonbeams 
 played on the few coarse implements for household pur- 
 poses, which hung from the rafters overhead, or were 
 ranged around the wall. No sound reached the listening 
 ears of Hubert, save the hard and audible breathings of 
 the old housekeeper, who, reposing on her small pallet, 
 spread in one corner, without curtains or hangings, 
 mumbled in her sleep, and dreamed aloud. " Holy Mary I" 
 she muttered, " I murdered her not — I delay no more — 
 I'll see the Cardinal." Hubert seemed struck, but pre- 
 sently passed on. There were no fastenings attached to 
 the area wicket, and being only upon the latch, it opened 
 without noise. Hubert stepped out, and looked around. 
 The ruggedness of the surrounding ruins was softened 
 down, as they lay before his eyes, in the profound repose 
 of moonlight ; but on those premises no intruder was 
 visible, all was as hushed, and as deserted, beneath the 
 watching stars, as he had left it in front. Shortly, he re- 
 entered the lonely dwelling, and, unmindful of the low 
 murmurs of the housekeeper, made his way back into the 
 apartment, whence he first issued. It would be hard to 
 depict the man's amazement, on discovering that the 
 street-door, which he had just that instant left bolted, 
 and closed, stood ajar. For several seconds he stopped 
 short, motionless, as if transfixed to the spot, by the rod 
 of some magician. Then he hasted to the entrance, and 
 issuing forth, thought he perceived a human figure, at a 
 short distance, half hid by the deceptive light. He hur- 
 ried thither, and pausing, peered in every possible direc- 
 tion, in vain : he discovered nothing, which could point 
 out the way the figure had fled. . There was not a sign of

 life around, nor near, nor afar off, amid the still, solitary 
 grandeur of the surrounding scene, which was delineated 
 to the eye, as in a panorama. Domes, steeples, turrets, 
 and the distant peaks of hills, lay blended together in 
 the almost imperceptible haze, which, without obscuring, 
 tempered their rugged forms ; yet was their outline suf- 
 ficiently defined, against the dark purple sky, white and 
 immovable, in the grey twilight. The whole city borrowed, 
 as it were, a spectral appearance, from those lifeless moon- 
 beams, which touched it, with a comfortless and superna- 
 tural beauty. Hubert was stationed beneath the superb 
 portico of the royal residence of the Queen Dowager. 
 Within that lofty dome were domiciled Isabella, the 
 haughty descendant of a line of kings, and her fair 
 daughter, the heroine of our history, the young, and lovely 
 Czerina. The fretted towers, and spires of the church of 
 St. Theresa, covering one side of the grand square, were 
 visible, half in moonlight, half in shade, immediately to 
 tlie right ; and at no great distance, on his left hand, the 
 proud keep or citadel of Hermanstadt, in the windows of 
 which a taper or two yet twinkled, stood out to the eye, 
 every rent and chasm of time obliterated, in the hallowing 
 light, as it frowned in Gothic and sombre splendour, upon 
 the overhanging precipice beyond. Behind him, at the 
 end of the square, stretched the ancient town, where 
 habitations of clay and basket-work, whose roofs of va- 
 rious unequal heights were covered with straw, held down 
 by transverse poles, lay crowded irregularly together, 
 like a confused chaos, without order or adequate space. 
 These were so close and inconvenient, as hardly to allow 
 a narrow interval, here and there, which might serve to 
 bear along " the tide of human existence." The high 
 street, as it was named, that in which Hubert resided, 
 was a ravine of this description. It branched out from 
 the grand square, in a line with the royal palace, and ex- 
 tended, for nearly a mile, to the foot of the ramparts, 
 which closed, with its gloomy barrier, portcullis, and

 flankers, the city vista. The new town, which consisted 
 of substantial brick edifices, built on a more commodious 
 plan, for the most part terminating in the grand square, 
 before mentioned, was surrounded by a double w^all, and 
 a deep fosse. It lay beyond the noble structure, at whose 
 base Hubert stood. Through it, the river Zibin flowed in 
 murmuring channels, supplying every street with a tribu- 
 tary stream, * here trickling in rills, there gushing in foun- 
 tains, while frequent tanks or basons of the glassy element 
 intervened, populous with the finny race. 
 
 Hubert, from whose immediate business in the grand 
 square we have in some degree digressed, was soon re- 
 called, by the sharp morning air, from the deep, and solemn 
 feeling of the moment, to a sense of his situation, and 
 baffled and dejected, he slowly retraced his steps home- 
 wards. He entered. Veronica, who had substituted for 
 her night-rail a dark kirtle of the simplest form, was 
 seated on a tripod stool, and crouched her fair body near 
 the hearth, bending, with much intentness, over a leaf of 
 vellum, which she held in her hand, and which, by the 
 aid of the fire-light, she was perusing, with unequivocal 
 symptoms of horror and amazement. Hubert approached 
 her. 
 
 " Whither have you been, father ?" she asked, without 
 removing her settled gaze from the object, on which her 
 eyes seemed rooted. The words issued almost still-born 
 from her livid lips, her cheeks were blanched, and her 
 whole frame trembled like an aspen. 
 
 "What is it, you grasp so wildly, Veronica?" de- 
 manded Hubert. But the maid was mute ; she merely 
 upheld the script in her hand, before the eyes of Hubert. 
 It was enough to sear his sight. Fresh characters were 
 inscribed upon a label of vellum ; they were yet moist ; 
 the crimson syllables still, as it were, welled. Those cha-

 racters were written in blood ! After awhile Hubert found 
 speech. 
 
 ** Where, child, did you fall in with that, my eyeballs 
 recoil to look upon ?" he inquired, in an accent, signifi- 
 cant of the awe and apprehension of his soul. 
 
 ** On my return," replied the trembling girl, '* as I 
 looked round, in surprize at missing you, my eyes acci- 
 dentally glanced upon this dreadful scrap of vellum, 
 lying on the settle near the fire-place, and I was about to 
 decipher the inscription, wdien you entered." 
 '* Read it," said her father. 
 
 In compliance with this direction, Veronica, with a 
 low and discomposed voice, delivered these words aloud : 
 ** Would you destroy body and soul ? Officious fool ! 
 Open th5 deposit, confided to you, at your peril." 
 
 If Veronica was affrighted at the thick strokes of new 
 spilt blood, traced on the instrument, she held shudder- 
 ing, between her fingers, Hubert was little less so, at their 
 awful purport. The conditional menace, which seemed 
 to pierce the stillest recesses of his soul, and to apprehend 
 the consequences of those suggestions of his evil nature, 
 which he dared scarcely acknowledge to himself, bewil- 
 dered, and appalled him. He drew the oaken table in 
 front of the hearth. The fire shot its blue flame upward, 
 and the vivid light discovered the ashy paleness, which 
 apprehension spread over the countenance of Veronica. 
 The mode, and threatening tenor of the communication 
 were alike calculated to inspire her with alarm, more 
 especially, that she could form no imaginable conjecture 
 in what direction she ought to shape her fears. But 
 Hubert was not then " 'i the vein" to notice her state of 
 inquietude. His whole soul was too intent on the fearful 
 act he was about to commit. The packet marshalled him 
 the way he v/as to go, and, like the forbidden apple, held 
 out, in its fruition, the knowledge of good and evil. The 
 purpose, with which he laboured, appeared almost too 
 mighty for explanation. At least, though his eye might

 speak his meaning, his convulsive attempts to voice his 
 wish, died inarticulate on his lips, and it was some 
 minutes, ere he faltered out, with that assumed calmness, 
 which his low, half-whispered tone, embarrassed address, 
 and glancing eye contradicted. 
 
 " Explain this superscription to me, Kintsdso* what is 
 the purport of the writing ?" And thereupon he resigned 
 the missive of Ragotzy, into the hands of the electrified 
 girl, who, on receiving it, held it before the light, as if to 
 assure herself, it was '' no false creation proceeding from 
 the heat-oppressed brain." 
 
 "Thus, then, my God! is the mystery of the blood- 
 red script interpreted," she said, in a voice below her 
 breath, and then more calmly added aloud, compelling 
 herself to a tone of indifference, though trembling with 
 bodings of she knew not what — " Father, this is addressed 
 to the queen-mother Isabella ; would you have me con- 
 sign it to the chest, for security, till the morning?" 
 
 " Veronica, attend to me," began her father with im- 
 pressive solemnity, and then he paused to collect himself. 
 "Dost thou remember, love," he presently continued, 
 " how, when thou wast yet a little child, thou, and thy de- 
 parted mother, and myself, found ourselves one tempestu- 
 ous evening, at the close of a hard day's journey, on the 
 borders of the forest of Belivar; — how, when cono-reg-ated 
 whirlwinds filled the air, with baleful darkness, and the 
 lightning streamed athw^art the intolerable obscurity of 
 the night, like the brand of the destroying angel, — when 
 earth and heaven shook, and the wrathful clouds spoke 
 out — dost thou remember?" 
 
 " Oh, yes, I do indeed," interrupted Veronica. " We 
 looked to the heaven upward, and down to the earth, and 
 lo! nought but darkness, and distress ! Even the ground, 
 we trod on, appeared to tremble, and a tongue of fire

 lapped all around like stubble. Think you, I can ever 
 forget the goodness of God, evinced in our preservation^?'* 
 " Need I remind thee, then," resumed the father, 
 " how, when every instant, the finger of St. Hubert was 
 made manifest, in the duration of our lives, and each in- 
 terval of additional being came, even like an immediate 
 reprieve, from the awful audit of eternity, that suddenly, 
 and unawares, as by a miracle, we were redeemed ? Need 
 I remind you, how, when those strong arm'i snatched us, 
 as it appeared, from doom, and conveyed us, weary and 
 worn, to where food, fire, and shelter cheered, and solaced 
 us, — that an oracle respecting thee was announced, in that 
 cavern, to which we found ourselves transported, as by 
 enchantment — those savage fantastic forms — those rude 
 men and women, who tended on our wants — those blue 
 meagre Cyganis, scarcely bearing the lineaments, or pos- 
 sessing any of the common attributes of humanity, unto 
 whom, nevertheless, we owed our rescue from an un- 
 timely death, — their habitation, their appearance, not 
 all the obliterating circumstances of time's current can 
 have effaced from your remembrance. — 'Tistrue, my love, 
 you were a mere child ; yet incidents, which strike power- 
 fully on our senses, in the primal freshness of perception, 
 will sometimes live in our memory, as long as our pulses 
 continue to beat. Oh ! there was one, among those dark 
 people of Egypt, whose image must have troubled your 
 subsequent dreams, and which no train of events can 
 have wrought out from your remembrance. She, I 
 mean, the haggard Boszorkany* who, emerging, from 
 the further gloom of the subterranean retreat, whither we 
 had been borne, raised thee, my Veronica, in her withered 
 arms, and, in all the fulness of inspiration, predicted your 
 future destiny. With the far-reaching energy of a heated 
 brain, she darkly hinted at the main incidents, which she

 foresaw, as in a vision, would chequer, and distinguish 
 the history of your days- Canst thou tell me, Veronica, 
 what was't the charmer presaged should illustrate the 
 chronicles of your eventful life ?" 
 
 '* She said," replied Veronica, " I know not what, in 
 her typical and ardent style, of the ' ravished treasure of 
 my bosom,' and ' the golden glory of my brow' — but 
 trust me, sir, it were to be credulous, beyond the license 
 of superstition, however the dark visions of a disturbed, 
 if not alienated mind, retain hold on our memory, to let 
 such thin, and airy circumstance influence our conduct. 
 Ah, no, father, human destinies are not in our own 
 volition ; still less do they hinge on the shadowy inspira- 
 tion * of our fellow mortals." 
 
 " Yet often," rejoined her father," obviously discom- 
 posed, " they, who make the occult sciences their study, 
 pierce the darkness of the future, as by a self-impulsion 
 of the soul, and will hit on truths with unerring light, 
 which are denied to the elaborate deductions of reason, 
 and are inaccessible to the highest reach of the under- 
 standing ; nathless, I say not, that they prescribe, or 
 fashion, at their wished pleasure, the order of those events, 
 which they only shadow out. For instance, Veronica, 
 what were those seeds, the sybil scattered on thy heart, to 
 make it swell, ere this, with thoughts of empire ? Thus ran 
 her augury, child — ^ Thy fate, maiden,' she said, at the 
 close of her address, * will depend, on the unravelling of 
 the intricate ways of the lofty, and the proud. When the 
 confidence of the wicked shall be violated, when his trust 
 shall fail, and he be confounded with shame, — when the 
 prey of the Mighty One shall be retaken, and the spoil, 
 seized by the terrible, shall be rescued, — when the sig- 
 net be broken, and the truth published, along the cause-

 when the eyes of the haughty shall be rebuked, wilt thou 
 shine, amongst the daughters of men, neither the humblest, 
 nor the most insigjiificant ; till when, thou wilt have to 
 struggle, with many a hard assay of privation, of sorrow, 
 and of peril.' Veronica," added her father, in a voice 
 rendered desperately calm, by his emotions, " the fulness 
 of time, appointed by the prophetess, draws nigh. That 
 packet contains thy destiny, and, if so, shall my child's 
 fate be locked up in its womb, and I not know it ? I will 
 fulfil the oracle !" and Hubert made a movement, as if to 
 receive back the packet, from the hands of Veronica, but 
 that high-spirited girl held the missive aloof, and, whilst 
 the pure flush of high-wrought feelings mantled her ever- 
 charming countenance, her fervid eye kindled into fire ; 
 an almost magnificent spirit seemed, at once, to animate 
 every nerve of her elastic form ; her lip quivered, and the 
 native energy of her character burst into full play, as she 
 demanded, almost in a tone of indignation, " Father, 
 what is it, you would do? — this is her highness's pro- 
 perty, and, let it contain what it may, it must not be in- 
 vaded." 
 
 "The time does not serve, Veronica," answered her 
 father, in a sullen tone, " to be deterred by idle delicacy, 
 or governed, by girlish scruples; the very ground, on 
 which I stand, is giving way under me. Your future 
 fortunes, my present interests, are at stake; nay, more, 
 my spent clew of life is now to be untwisted ; the chances 
 of my breathing upon earth, many days longer, resolve 
 themselves into one single cast — they are narrowed to 
 this solitary issue — whether or no, I make my breast the 
 depositary of a secret, which, though the Carpathians co- 
 vered it, will one day break out. Veronica, I am the 
 thrall of Fate ! On my forehead, at my birth, was branded 
 her cruel wrath. She cowered, with heavy and depressing 
 wing, over my cradle : she hath still clouded my 
 morning, and noon of life, and now, lowereth over its 
 close."

 Veronica clenched her hands, and the big tears rolled 
 over her cheek. '* Oh, say not so, father ! you rend my 
 heart — my fortunes, and your life ! — they cannot have 
 any connexion with this enclosure, unless, perfidious as 
 the smooth ocean, you, yourself, entail it by basely be- 
 traying trust. Oh, my dearest parent, do not charge 
 yourself with this sin !" 
 
 " Veronica," said Hubert, " in respect to what you 
 ignorantly call the sin, I hope my purpose will plead my 
 excuse with my patron saint, who must needs be cogni- 
 zant of the extent of the wickedness, I am anxious to ex- 
 pose to the world, by sounding the depths of this myste- 
 rious packet." 
 
 "Was ever such deplorable casuistry?" exclaimed 
 Veronica ; ** think you, that the consummation, however 
 desirable, will justify the adoption of such means? Never, 
 believe me, dear father, in the eyes of heaven — evil is 
 not to be thought of, as a stepping-stone to attain some 
 hypothetical, and contingent benefit," 
 
 " Ay, there it is !" replied Hubert ; *' another leaf out 
 of the new-fangled moralities, that, for the first time since 
 the creation, have been broached and started, in this pre- 
 sumptuous age, to the great scandal, and horror of all 
 good catholics. Unhappily, my love, you were early in- 
 fected by your lamented mother, whom, therefore, may 
 the mother of God assoil, and, in due process of time, 
 take to her bosom !" And here Hubert devoutly crossed 
 himself. "However, child," he continued, "lest there 
 indeed lurk some portion of human infirmity, in the mo- 
 tives, which instigate me to dive into others' secrets, I 
 will not fail, on the earliest occasion, to make a free shrift 
 to our holy confessor, who, after proper penance, will, 
 doubtless absolve me; though, in sooth," he added, "the 
 twelve months' indulgence which, last Whitsuntide, I 
 purchased, ought, in equity, to cover any such venial 
 transgression, or, verily, my hongrees were ill -bestowed." 
 The father ended, and Veronica spoke.

 '' Oh ? apply not so assuasive an unction to your soul," 
 she replied, with animation; '' your fellow-creature 
 cannot, of himself, absolve you, neither will your Creator, 
 through his agency, if you so palter with his righteous 
 judgments, as, premeditatedly, to compromise your eternal 
 salvation, in the assurance of His forgiveness, and thus 
 convert His long-suffering and tender mercies, into an 
 apology of crime. 'Tis a rash venture, to play at fast- 
 and-loose with the Almighty: and oh! my dear father! 
 the horrible paction, you boast of, is a quieting opiate for 
 the conscience, to lull you to destruction. Were you to 
 trust to it, you would find it delusive, as the veriest iris, 
 that ever floated on the sunbeams. How can a creature 
 of clay, like ourselves, have authority to chaffer, with the 
 dispensations of the Most High?" 
 
 " No more, I charge you, on your duty, or you will 
 anger me," interrupted Hubert: ''how often have I to 
 repeat to you, that I may not listen to your impious ani- 
 madversions, upon our revered religion? I take heaven, 
 and the saints to witness, you have cost me more to 
 mother church, than the aggregate of my other offences." 
 
 " /, my father?" ejaculated Veronica. 
 
 " Yes; Veronica! the sin smells rank to heaven, by 
 which I was over-induced, at your erring mother's behest, 
 to have you bred, in her heretic persuasion. But now, 
 other business presses. Child, hand me the packet." 
 
 '^ Dear parent," replied Veronica, in a solemn and 
 animated tone ; " if religion deter you not, yet can you, — 
 dare you," — she paused. 
 
 "Well, child, well?" said Hubert, tetchily, but half 
 satisfied with this commencement, "what say you? " 
 
 " Will you," resumed Veronica, " inspect the pa- 
 pers, after the awful interdiction of this terrible scroll?" 
 and again she raised the sanguine script, which had 
 lain, during the discussion, unregarded on the table. 
 Whilst Hubert's eyes, involuntarily, settled on the 
 words, "that most miraculous orgran," which had made it-

 self audible, a short time before, breathed again, along the 
 chamber, iterating, word for word, in a low tone, but 
 with most distinct articulation, the inhibition of the 
 blood-stained scroll, — '^Open the deposit, confided to you, 
 at your peril." Both caught the words, each one of 
 them, and all of them together; and their cheeks turned 
 deadly white, as, starting, they instinctively looked around 
 in the expectation of beholding the speaker. But the 
 being, from whom the aerial premonition descended, was 
 not to be seen. Their eyes, with objectless horror, 
 sharpened almost to agony, scanned enquiringly every 
 inch of the visible apartment, and sought, with invo- 
 luntary eagerness, the unpenetrated places around. 
 Still, though a wdder scope was afforded to the imagina- 
 tion, than to the senses, for the feeble glare of the hearth 
 contended, but faintly, with the darkness, in the extremity 
 of the chamber, their search was sent in vain; and 
 if vitality, besides their own, pervaded that chamber, it 
 must have borne such a shape, as mortal vision might not 
 grasp, nor, perhaps, mortal mind conceive. After taking 
 a survey of all, within the scope of sight, the eyes of Ve- 
 ronica, and of her father encountered, each seeking to 
 read, in the troubled expression of the other, as in a page, 
 whose story terror inscribed, the answer to the query, 
 trembling on both their lips, what can it mean? A curd- 
 ling awe tingled, through every pore, like so many needle 
 points of ice. Not half an hour had elapsed, since the 
 father's senses had been startled, by the same appalling 
 voice, and something whispered coldly within, that the 
 invisible, who had twice premonished him, was the same, 
 who had inscribed the prohibition to unclose the packet, 
 And yet, what were the contents of this deposit, argued 
 Hubert with himself, to a spiritualised being, fresh from 
 the everlasting paradise of souls ? "St. Hubert pardon me 
 if I err ! but the veins of a phantom are not like to swell, 
 with the crimson tide of life. A hem! 'tis a moot ques- 
 tion." To form any hypothesis, which could explain to

 him the mystery, was a vain endeavour; and again Hu- 
 bert ranged his eye, with a bloodshot, and unquiet glare, 
 in the direction of the inner threshold, where all objects 
 lay in deceptive shadow. But, however an over-wrought 
 imagination might suggest, the baffled vision sought, in 
 vain, for any defined outline, in the far gloom of the 
 passage, though the sense of hearing, now become mor- 
 bidly acute, was " alarum'd," every instant, by the rust- 
 ling breath of the night-air. As for Veronica, she sat 
 for long, wholly inanimate and unconscious, with white 
 face, and both hands clasped on her eyes, and forehead. 
 The admonition, ratified in blood, dropped from her 
 relaxed hold, unconsciously. Then Hubert, deriving, 
 like the ostrich in the fable, a false courage, from wilfully 
 blinding himself to the actual hazard of his position, 
 suflfered the short-sighted, though subtle policy of his 
 nature, to thrust itself, before the wisdom, that should 
 have controuled it. He snatched the document, out of his 
 daughter's yielding hands, and, in the same instant, tore 
 oflP the twisted silken braid, and burst open the outer 
 covering. So great, indeed, was the degree of nervous 
 violence, with which he unripped the seals, and jerked 
 asunder the envelope, that the enclosures were dispersed 
 on every side. 
 
 Then first it was, that Veronica testified some sense of 
 what was going on, and her returning consciousness 
 was evinced, by a cry of terror. She carried her hand to 
 her brow, in bitter anguish ; beholding, in dim perspec- 
 tive, the sad train of calamity, consequent upon the 
 false step of the last minute. But the fatal deed was 
 done ! — there was no receding. The integrity of the trust, 
 placed in her father's hands, had been broken. Millions 
 of worlds could not buy back again that violated seal, 
 nor oceans of tears wash away the consequence. What 
 acumen can match that of the human heart, impelled to 
 action, by the apprehensions of attachment? It will con- 
 centrate, in one convulsive throb, all the lights of

 experience, and all the tact of intuition. 'Tis that 
 '* true wisdom, " which Lord Shaftesbury so beauti- 
 fully insists upon ; — 'tis indeed something better, than 
 reason and knowledge, being the principle and origin 
 of it.* Thus, with a single glance of her heart's eye, 
 Veronica comprehended the heinousness of the fault, 
 and the fatal expiation, it involved. Oh! why, in this 
 evil world, doth the principle of sin extend, beyond the 
 guilty, and defile, in some measure, with its deadly virus, 
 all, within the sphere of its contagion ? Oh ! why is it, 
 there is no escape from its all-pervading fascination ? Why 
 is it, that the innocent have to answer for lapses and of- 
 fences, not their own, and although guiltless of the wrong, 
 are made partakers of the anguish ? If the penalty of error 
 lit only on the head of the erring; if the just penance, 
 dodging the heels of crime, only overtook the criminal; if 
 the atonement of sin were singly offered up, by the sweat 
 of the sinner's brow, or the desolate bitterness of the sin- 
 ner's heart, the divine economy would better accord, in our 
 short-sighted judgment, with that of an all-righteous Pro- 
 vidence. But wherefore expostulate with Omniscience? 
 Assuredly an hour will arrive, when this, and all other 
 difficulties,! that darken the ways of Him, who inha- 
 biteth infinity, will be illustrated, and the full sunshine 
 of heaven break forth, in all its truth, and all its splen- 
 dour. But, till His "kingdom come," it is not given 
 to our limited faculties, to attempt, what peradventurethe 
 angel nearest his councils might vainly conceit — to gauge 
 the depths of Eternal wisdom : —

 Let US return, from this digression, to the course of the 
 history ; — 
 
 " Oh my dearest father ! " exclaimed Veronica, in a 
 voice, half choked by contending emotions, " in what 
 terms will you reply to her grace, when this packet shall 
 be demanded of you ? " She would have said more, but 
 here her loud sobs interrupted her intended expostula- 
 tion. 
 
 Hubert strove to hide from his daughter, the impres- 
 sion, which her manifest anguish made on him, by occu- 
 pying himself, in gathering together the various enclosures 
 from off the floor. Assuming as composed a tone, as his 
 feelings would admit of, he said : '* There is something 
 working here, which tells me, that these writings, (and 
 he placed them on the table), interest you, Veronica, in- 
 finitely more, than they concern her, unto whom they are 
 addressed." 
 
 "This is the very excess of wilful self-deception," an- 
 swered Veronica ; '* the merest coinage of the imagi- 
 nation. Speak not of me, my sire. Tell me not, these 
 papers bear any reference to me ; but," she continued, 
 in a burst of feverish anxiety, and with almost a shriek 
 of sudden terror, ''devise, think, ponder, do, ere it be 
 too late, upon some means to avert the catastrophe, 
 which the infatuation of an instant may have entailed. 
 See, see, already the flickering grey, in yonder skies," 
 (and she pointed, through the casement, to where the 
 morning star ' began to pale her ineffectual fires ' ) " an- 
 nounces the approach of dawn. Oh, be speedy then ! 'tis 
 a matter of life and death, we are upon, — every instant 
 teems with fate. Father, what's to be done ? Let us 
 consult, — consult for both our lives." 
 
 The eyes of Veronica filled with tears, as, painfully 
 affected, by her own earnest words, she sank upon a seat. 
 Her appeal shot into the soul of her sire, who secretly 
 regretted his precipitance, and almost wished the deed 
 undone ; but he had now proceeded too far, to be diverted

 from his course of action, by reproaclies or arguments. 
 He was irresistibly impressed with the belief, that nothing 
 remained, in this pressing emergence, except to make the 
 most of such materials, as his treachery had provided. 
 He was filled with a wild, but profound conviction, that, 
 by means of the documents in question, he was ordained 
 to achieve an important discovery, which would go far 
 to wipe out the offences of his late life, and which might 
 place him in a position, where, instead of needing an 
 indemnity, he might himself command a recompence, — 
 
 A COMPENSATION. 
 
 Certain severe afflictions, that had wintered the heart 
 of Hubert, several years antecedent to the present epoch, 
 made the glimpse of sunshine, which he here forecasted, 
 peculiarly gratifying; and, moreover, subsequent to 
 the augury above narrated, a strange mysterious confes- 
 sion, of which he had been made the involuntary audi- 
 tor, seemed, at once, to hold out a probability of such 
 a consummation,^ and to indicate, that its advent was not 
 distant. As we shall, hereafter, have occasion to recur 
 to the collateral incidents, we now barely glance at, we 
 would merely observe, in this place, that they possessed, 
 for the breast of Hubert, an anxious interest, from their 
 being connected, with the mystery and importance of the 
 identical packet, he had received from Ragotzy. Only 
 through his daughter's agency, was he likely to arrive at 
 that knowledge, for which his soul panted ; but he began 
 to despair of moving a resolution, which he found more 
 deeply rooted, than he could have anticipated. 
 
 At length, calming his feelings to meet the occasion, 
 irresolutely, he addressed her, "■ Veronica, edes kint- 
 sem,"* he said, with a reluctant, and insinuating voice, 
 "it matters not, whether 1 take advantage of the inadver- 
 tance, you condemn, if, as I trust, my precipitance be 
 considered venial, the consequences will be proportion-

 able ; otherwise, I may have to undergo a commensurate 
 punishment : in neither case, however, will any doubt be 
 entertained of my having perused these papers, and it 
 would be to no purpose attesting my innocence. Now 
 that the envelop is torn asunder, any assertion of the sort 
 would seem to carry falsehood on its very face. Away 
 then with your apprehensions of still further committing 
 ourselves — that, I tell you, is impossible; nor can we 
 better evade our doom, than by making the very spoil, 
 in which consists our danger, the vantage-ground of 
 our deliverance. — Veronica," he added, impressively, 
 " echoes are ringing in my brain, and in my heart, which 
 assure me, that the purport of these writings is linked 
 and entwined, in some extraordinary way, with your 
 destiny. The blaze of fate and prophecy is in these 
 enclosures. Read then, love, with eagle's eyes, and 
 hasten their lagging justice. Read, and relieve me of 
 that dreadful suspense, which, for so long, hath harrowed 
 up my being, under calamities, that might make Patience 
 herself grow wild, and tilt at her own shadow. I shall 
 have, in no long time, to prepare for the sunrise muster. 
 Dearest! he presently subjoined, whilst a glance of im- 
 patience stole from under his lowering brows, for our 
 Lady's sake, take up the papers, and read." 
 
 " Oh ! how I regret, I may not here oblige you," 
 answered Veronica, in a low, determined voice: " I would 
 die ! yea, not a vein I wear, but I would lance, to plea- 
 sure you ; only not this, no, not this, father." She ceased, 
 clasping her hands, and looking upward, but her voice 
 became too choaked to proceed. 
 
 *' Because," answered Hubert, with heat, '* this happens 
 to be the particular, I require of you — you'd die forsooth 
 to please me ! ay, Veronica, 'tis an easy thing to say, but 
 I do not ask of you to rip your veins up, I merely entreat 
 of a child to save her parent, and, influenced by the pride 
 of opinion, she refuses." 
 
 " Oh ! put it not thus," replied Veronica; " you desire

 MANUSCRIPT III. 119 
 
 me to do that, which must be sinful in the eyes of God, 
 and I would not, knowingly, incur his anger." 
 
 " Be, what you designate a sin on my head, Veronica ; 
 I take it all, freely, and without reserve," said Hubert. 
 
 " But you may not thus stand betwixt me, and my 
 maker," interposed Veronica, with the look of an admo- 
 nitory angel, "since every one will have to suffer, in him- 
 self, the measure of his individual transgression. — Oh ! 
 my beloved father!" she continued, (whilst her enthu- 
 siastic temperament glowed with intense, and high-minded 
 affection,) " permit me to point out to you the strait line 
 of duty : — carry these papers, as soon as you return from 
 the parade, to queen Isabella. Inform her, how they 
 came into your possession ; admit that, under some in- 
 fatuation, you ventured to break the seal, but that, after- 
 wards, on repenting of your error, you resolved to con- 
 vey the documents to her royal hands, with their contents 
 inviolate." 
 
 *' Do this, father: cast yourself boldly upon Isabella's 
 goodness, and leave the result to Providence." 
 
 At this reply, so unreservedly pronounced, Hubert lost 
 all patience. " Jesu Maria!" he exclaimed, in a raised 
 voice, " was ever such infatuation ! — proceed to the palace ! 
 — you counsel like a child, in ignorance of the ways of 
 this wrong world Were I to square my policy by your 
 abstract notions of right, I should march to inevitable 
 destruction. Oh! if you love me, forego the scruples of 
 a too sensitive conscience, which, let me tell you, child, in 
 one so young, as thou art, must be a very unstable guide, 
 and monitor, and ought to be subjected to the more com- 
 petent direction of some holy minister. Veronica, have I 
 not ever been indulgent to you ?" 
 
 ** Indeed, indeed," she replied, in a weeping accent; 
 ** from my earliest memory unto the present hour, you 
 have ever shewn yourself the kindest father and the tender- 
 est friend, in the strictest sense of those endearing titles." 
 
 **Then do you bless, and requite me for all," responded

 Hubert: '* it is your peculiar province; here, kintsaso* 
 receive the papers." 
 
 ** Oh, no more! by these tears, no more! I beg," 
 mournfully replied the maiden, pressing her father's hand 
 to her lips ; but, though she still declined, the quivering 
 of her voice seemed to evince a greater struggle within, 
 than she v^ished should be apparent. 
 
 Hubert could withhold his wrath no longer. " You will 
 not retract your cruel resolution," he exclaimed ; "■ hear 
 it, Holy Mary ! Behold it, sainted Hubert ! A daughter 
 declines to stretch out a finger, to save her father's life ! I 
 tell you, unnatural girl," he went on, in increased anger, 
 *' in the teeth of your heretic persuasion, that it is not 
 agreeable to the great Sire of all, to see a child dispute his 
 injunctions, by whom she hath breath and life. Oh ! 
 there is nothing, I trow, more surely tasks the vengeance 
 of the saints, than filial ingratitude." 
 
 Veronica would not trust her voice with any reply, but 
 throwing herself on her knees, at the feet of Hubert, as he 
 delivered the last stern sentence, vented her feeling, in the 
 anguish of bitter tears. 
 
 But another auditor was nigh ; one, who, invisible 
 and unknown, had drank in every syllable, that had 
 fallen from the lips of Veronica, and who had been a 
 rapt listener of the discussion, between her and Hubert. 
 He did full justice to the inflexible texture of her nature, 
 and appreciated the accuracy and purity of her judgment ; 
 whilst, in her intrepid avowal of her sentiments, he recog- 
 nised elements of mind, congenial to the magnanimity of 
 his own bosom. He overheard all ; and afterwards, there 
 were moments, when, in the gorgeous residence of kings, 
 and in the sacred receptacles of piety, the remembrance 
 would almost unman him, when, amidst all the delicious 
 strife of empire, and the pride of fame, and the consola- 
 tions of religion, he would recal to his mind, the steadfast

 disobedience of this right-thinking maiden, whom neither 
 threats nor entreaties could prevail upon, to act in oppo- 
 sition to the dictates of her conscience. 
 
 Veronica was still kneeling at the feet of Hubert, and 
 bitterly lamenting, as if her heart would burst, when, 
 suddenly, a faint distant noise without, challenged atten- 
 tion, and awakened the moonlit silence of the night. 
 Hubert listened, and changed colour — the deep hum ga- 
 thered, as it came on, and became gradually more thick, 
 and louder, sounding like the monotonous tramp, and 
 clash of armed soldiers. 
 
 ** Listen!" exclaimed Hubert, starting up, in a voice 
 which bespoke his inward anxiety. 
 
 The sound continued to roll nearer and nearer. At 
 length, the military reached the house, where they made a 
 sudden halt. Veronica sprung upon her feet, and the 
 unusual occurrence effectually startled her out of her 
 tears. Breathless with alarm, they both stood, mute and 
 still, looking at one another, in the attitude of listening. 
 The silence, however, was but momentary : soon violent 
 knocks resounded against the door, and a voice was heard, 
 demanding admittance, in a tone of authority. The mo- 
 ment was full of fate. To huddle together the several 
 papers, from off the table, into their original envelope— to 
 elevate the near window-seat, and inchest the packet, in 
 company with the mysterious scroll, within its cavity, 
 was, with Hubert, the affair of a moment : the hollow 
 within served the purpose of a trunk, and was the safer 
 place of concealment, inasmuch as its lid formed a 
 wooden seat, projecting from beneath the casement. At 
 the same instant that he shut down the covering, he cast 
 a significant look, at his pale daughter, and then went, and 
 undid the clumsy fastening of the street-door. Immedi- 
 ately on its being thrown open, a file of soldiers crowded 
 into the humble chamber, which soon became fully OC' 
 cupied. The commander of the detachment stepped 
 forward, and, bending stiffly, addressed himself to

 Hubert : *' You are the captain of the night-guard, I 
 presume ?" 
 
 ^* Even so ; and you the Graf Bathori, if I mistake 
 not ?" answered the other. 
 
 '^Then, sir, I attach you, on account of certain crimes 
 and misdemeanours, touching the state. Do you," con- 
 tinued the speaker, turning to a soldier, " examine the 
 habit of this man, whether there be any thing treasonable 
 upon him — some of you search the house, and whom- 
 soever you find, conduct hither." 
 
 In obedience to this order, two of the men quitted the 
 room ; another approached Hubert, who, stepping back, 
 motioned him off, with a determined gesture, while he 
 turned to Bathori, and, with a more collected mien, and 
 in a firmer voice, than could have been expected, con- 
 sidering his critical situation, requested to be informed, by 
 whose authority he acted. 
 
 " You cannot suppose," he said, " that I shall submit 
 to this arbitrary caption, at your mandate, unless you can 
 produce legal, and sufficient grounds for the procedure." 
 
 "There is my warrant ; satisfy yourself:" and thus 
 speaking, the baron presented him, with the lettre de 
 cachet, for his arrest. " You perceive," he added, as 
 Hubert looked it over, "it has affixed to it the lord re- 
 gent's sign manual." 
 
 " Martinuzzi ! hem ! so, so !" muttered Hubert indis- 
 tinctly to himself, whilst an inexplicable expression stole 
 over his sallow features. " Comes the arrow out of that 
 quiver?" He paused, as if lost in thought. Quickly 
 recovering himself, he gave back the warrant, with a 
 slight obeisance, to the officer, saying, " I acknowledge 
 the formula, and am ready to follow you." 
 
 The soldier then proceeded to search him, but nothing 
 of any consequence was found upon his person. Mean- 
 wliile Veronica had drawn herself, with an involuntary 
 sort of motion, close by the side of her father, and, twin- 
 ing his arm into hers, stood, with a countenance, as pale,

 as if she had just risen from the grave. She did not 
 weep — she could not ; she held her hand to her bosom, 
 which lieaved, in rapid rise and fall, against her bodice, 
 but her thoughts " lay too deep for tears." She perhaps 
 reflected, that they had " fallen on evil times," when 
 treason and tyranny, reciprocally, begot each other, and 
 when there was but one step, from the dungeon to the 
 scafibld. That fatal grade, it was commonly reported, 
 followed closely on imprisonment, and an internal spasm 
 agonized her young heart, like the earnest of anticipated 
 orphanage. One of the men returned, and communicated, 
 in a low voice, with his commander. The latter said 
 something that was inaudible, adding aloud, "Molest 
 him not." The man bowed, and immediately again left 
 the apartment. 
 
 The heart of Veronica beat thickly. " Father," she 
 warbled, in a thrilling and silvery whisper, that vibrated 
 to all the deep feelings of that father's heart, '' where 
 thou sojournest, there will I abide ; they shall not part us.'' 
 
 Hubert took her bloodless hand in his, and pressed it 
 to his lips. By and bye, a commotion, indicating some 
 new cause of alarm, became audible, and a most peculiar 
 voice broke out into objurgations and complaint. A 
 struggle within the narrow passage followed. Veronica 
 was not slov.' in recognizing the harsh intonation of the 
 ancient housekeeper. Her outcries resounded through 
 the hous2 ; but, malgre every saint in the calendar, and, 
 what was more, despite of tooth and nail, her captors 
 succeeded in hauling their prize, into the room ; and surely 
 (to use the eloquent apostrophe of Burke) " never before 
 lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a 
 more resplendent vision." In truth, the old domestic 
 was a very giant of a woman, and could only be borne in 
 the arms of the two soldiers, by dint of main force; the 
 handkerchief, which had bound her head, in lieu of a 
 night-cap, had fallen oiT in the scuffle, and hung sus- 
 pended from her neck ; her long, lanky, grey hairs stream-

 ed, like those of a sybil, in every direction ; and she 
 exerted her bare arms and legs, with an energy of good 
 will, not at all common. And now outspake the officer : 
 '' Let the Kurvanya* loose," he vociferated, in a key, an 
 octave higher, than the shrill clamour of the housekeeper. 
 The men, immediately, set the robust virago on her feet, 
 who, darting forward, with a strange straddling sort of 
 locomotion, to where her master and Veronica were sta- 
 tioned, and, having likewise recovered her enjoyment of 
 speech, seemed disposed to make liberal use of her privilege. 
 
 "Well-a-day !" she began, in a harsh and grating voice; 
 but Baron Bathori cut her oration short, in limine, by 
 commanding silence. Then addressing himself to Hubert, 
 he said, " You must accompany me to the castle forth- 
 with. Soldiers, secure the prisoner." At the word, two 
 of the company grounded their muskets, at Hubert's side. 
 Then it was, that Veronica prostrated herself, before the 
 officer, and, raising her voice, exclaimed, in an accent of 
 the most touching pathos, *' Permit me, sir, to accom- 
 pany my dear father whithersoever he goeth ; it is the 
 especial privilege of a child to tend her parent, and there- 
 fore you will accede to my prayer." 
 
 " Willingly," answered the officer, making a motion to 
 raise her from his feet, which she firmly resisted — " were 
 the option mine ; but my orders extend only to the per- 
 son of your father, and I cannot, on any account, depart 
 from their letter." 
 
 For a bitter moment, the shock of this repulse seemed 
 to overwhelm the beautiful suppliant, and she suffered 
 her head to droop, in disappointment. "Good God!" 
 she ejaculated, "do not say that; you cannot have the 
 heart to mean it. It is impossible ! Oh ! yet," she pro- 
 ceeded again, elevating her rich countenance, " vouch- 
 safe me this single indulgence, and Heaven bless you, sir." 
 
 She ceased. The agonized tone, with which these words 
 
 * Kurvanya may be grossly rendered, Mother of harlots.

 were uttered, produced a sensation of secret sympathy, in 
 all, who heard them. Her glittering tresses had burst 
 their braided trammels, and fell, in glossy mazes, from her 
 upraised head, adown her round, long, full, regal throat, 
 and fairest bosom, looking, like the foliage of the cypress, 
 floating over purest statuary-marble ; her small clinched 
 hands were outstretched, her upcast burning eyes contra- 
 dicted the death-like paleness of her countenance, and 
 her ^exuberant, and dimpled lips, pale with their proper 
 odours, were partly open, whence her breath, suspended 
 with her fate, hardly gave signs of life ; but her little 
 heart knocked perceptibly, at her bosom, like an unfledged 
 bird, against its bars. Hushed to silence was every other 
 sound — the agonizing pulsations of that heart were alone 
 audible. As she thus knelt, with her upward counte- 
 nance, her hands clasped in each other, and the exquisite 
 symmetry of her flexible form, set off, by her drooping 
 dress, which, from her having slipped it on in haste, was 
 left a good deal disordered. Veronica presented a study, 
 such as Chantrey himself might not have disdained to 
 make immortal, in the modelling of a Naiad. There was 
 in that startling moment the silence of deep feeling, which 
 the young Bathori might hardly abide ; but he remembered, 
 that he had a paramount duty to perform, and strung 
 himself for the task accordingly. Again, he would have 
 raised the pallid girl from her incumbent posture, but she 
 defeated his object, exclaiming, in an impassioned voice — 
 *' Let my knees grow to the earth, till thou yieldest to my 
 agony; say only one word, yes — say yes — I conjure 
 thee, sir, in the tenderest name of filial piety, to have 
 mercy on us both. Oh ! bethink you, what it is, to be 
 thrown into captivity, to drag, day after day, a galling 
 chain — I mean, not that on the body, but on the free 
 mind — to be borne down, without having a friend to 
 relieve the ceaseless pressure, on the overwrought spirit. 
 Oh ! give me leave to attend my father — our lives are 
 twisted on one thread, and cannot be spent asunder.'

 Tims saying, she uplifted her imploring eyes, to the face 
 of the official, anxiously abiding his next word. 
 
 Bathori remained unmoved, though his voice was tre- 
 mulous, as he replied, " It may not be ;" and he turned 
 aside, to conceal, and get rid of an emotion, that did him 
 honour. 
 
 " It may not be : march !" — "No — halt ! every one," 
 cried the half-distracted maiden, with a scream, that thrilled 
 through the very bones of her listeners ; then, with the 
 grace of a fawn, she bounded on her feet, and flinging 
 herself upon Hubert's bosom, wreathed her lily arms 
 around his neck. Presently, fixing her large and glori- 
 ous eyes, on the officer, as if she would dart into his very 
 soul, she said, "Let me rest here — it is my father's 
 breast, on which I lay my head. If you tear the sapling 
 from its stem, will it not perish ? Sir, overpass your war- 
 rant, at your peril ; think not, that I will be murdered 
 tamely. If you rend the ivy from the trunk which nou- 
 rished it, will it not droop and die ? At your peril, I say ; 
 I stand upon my rights. Read — read, sir, the warrant, 
 that is in your hand, or that behind, that blacker instru- 
 ment, which commands my father's execution. I know 
 your tricks of state, but neither in one, nor in the other, 
 do you find my death compassed. I stand upon my 
 rights. If you tear my father, from the cordage of these 
 arms, I die, broken-hearted — broken-hearted ! I will not 
 be murdered — see to it — it is not in the writ." 
 
 So rapidly was this passionate appeal poured forth, 
 with the overpowering intonation of despair, that Ba- 
 thori, who alone possessed the authority, felt too much 
 overawed himself, for some time, to interfere. 
 
 " I will thank you, sir," at length he said, again ad- 
 dressing himself to Hubert; " to prevail upon your 
 daughter, to submit, patiently, to what my duty obliges 
 me. I really trusted, ere now, to have lodged you in 
 the castle." 
 
 Hubert turned to his daughter, and, with a gesture, that

 intimated the uselessness of further opposition, signed to 
 her to obey. But the enthusiastic girl, clinging closer 
 to his neck, exclaimed: — " They will have hard work, 
 who tear thee from me, father. To the castle, with all 
 my heart, — let us be taken thither." 
 
 ** Ay! but together.'' 
 
 "Yes," she added, and the piercing tones of her voice 
 sunk, in her father's ear, to a whisper, which seemed to 
 express the very soul of filial affection, — '•' it shall be to- 
 gether,''' 
 
 Then Bathori, in a subdued, but settled voice, said to 
 those next him, — " Secure the prisoner, and detain the 
 maiden." The command was barely issued, when it was 
 obeyed; and Veronica was hardly made aware of their 
 purpose, before she found it executed. The new moon 
 was colouring the horizon, and all was chill, and comfort- 
 less, as the hour, as Bathori turned abruptly from the 
 house. A few men-at-arms defiled after him. 
 
 The adjutant motioned to the unhappy father, who, 
 with impassive eye and lips, lingered, for a minute, con- 
 templating the well-nigh lifeless form of his adored child, 
 painted, in the tender rays of that matin hour. Oh! what 
 a long history may sometimes be melted down, into a 
 minute's pang! What a world of retrospection; what 
 thoughts, and feelings, tumultuous, and intense, may be 
 epitomized into the interval, even of a minute! '' While 
 the body lives half a pulse's stroke," — ay, even in so 
 brief a section on the dial-plate of human life — 
 
 " The phantoms of a thousand hours, 
 Each from his voiceless grave,"* 
 
 thronged, with dreadful concentration, on Hubert's mind; 
 and, as some obliterated scroll, instantly, yields back its 
 latent inscription, at the spell of science; so the past 
 events of Hubert's life, touched by the fierce chemistry

 of remorse, were, on a sudden, broug:ht up into view, in 
 tints, as fresh and as vivid, as when they livingly greeted, 
 and soothed his feelings, in the dawn, and meridian of his 
 existence. Lo! in the sliape of the being before him, he 
 beheld her mother, as when first, in the bloom of youth, 
 and rank, and opulence, she linked her destiny, with his. 
 But one offspring blessed their union ; and, heavens! how 
 the hearts of the fond parents came to repose, on the little 
 Veronica. Surely, never was a babe more lovely! And 
 the infant grew, and waxed in years, and beauty ; and the 
 dear prattler is their joy; yea, in all the bitterness of 
 their lot, under the pressure of calamity, stricken by the 
 anathema of Heaven, they would kiss their child, and be 
 grateful. Her happiness was their day-star, from on 
 high, glittering, in the horizon of a brilliant to-morrow, 
 and shedding the prospective light of hope, and consola- 
 tion. The cherub lost her mother; and Hubert, holding 
 the innocent child in his arms, breathed the incense of a 
 vow, over the manes of his Veronica, and resolved, for 
 that child's interests to live — for her sake, to strain every 
 exertion, that he might one day reinstate her, in her 
 proper sphere, apart from the ordinary dwelling-place 
 of mortals, the vapours, and the storms, which deform, 
 and disturb the moral hemisphere; enshrining her — 
 
 " In regions mild, of calm and serene air. 
 Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot, 
 Which men call earth." 
 
 But more especially, he vowed to train her, in the paths of 
 purity, and peace; to save her, by his parental providence — 
 by his unsleeping care, from the assaults, and machina- 
 tions of an unfeeling generation. Great God of the 
 quick and dead! How had he redeemed his oath? Driven 
 from error to crime, yielding to temptation after tempta- 
 tion, sacrificing all he held dear, either to some sordid 
 calculation, or new object of selfishness, his deeds had 
 gradually sunk their condition in life, to one of compara-

 tive destitution ; had blasted the prospects of his throne — 
 destined treasure — of the being, on whom he had only to 
 think, to become — 
 
 " Patient as the female dove, 
 When that her golden couplets are disclosed." 
 
 Well, that may be a rankling reflection, but it hath its 
 consolation — she is left him, for a stay, amidst all his ca- 
 lamities; his potent arm might yet protect her ; his pre- 
 sence, evermore, watch over her, guard her, from every 
 sin, and shield her, from the sharp visitation of this 
 wrong world! — ^' How so?" and tumultuous memory re- 
 curred to the travail of the fearful present. Hubert 
 looked about him bewildered. Full streamed the cold 
 grey light of dawn, through the open portal, shedding a 
 lurid, and terrible, distinctness on the melancholy scene. 
 *^How so?"' half shrieked aloud again, the wretched man, 
 in the accessof his agony — ''Where then is my Veronica? 
 Deserted ! pennyless ! insensible, in the arms of strangers! 
 How ? can her father, who is so pledged, and who loves 
 her, with the intense love of that close connexion, violate 
 his oath ? He abandons his child because of his crimes. 
 He goes, — ha! to what bourne am I bound? — perhaps 
 thescafFold!" 
 
 The colour, which had been varying, on the cheek of 
 Veronica, at this instant, wholly fled. One languid look 
 she cast, towards her distracted parent, and then sunk 
 motionless, into the arms of the old housekeeper, as, under 
 the escort of the guard, Hubert rushed, from the apart- 
 ment.

 antient seal of the city attests this. It bore the impres- 
 sion of a tower, circumscribed, with the following words, 
 in the Roman character '^ Sigillum civium de villa 
 Hermanni." * The site, on which the citadel was 
 built, had been perforated, with subterranean passages, 
 leading to various parts of the city, and without the 
 ramparts. A long, narrow, and embattled gallery of the 
 castle, laterally overlooked an inner court-yard, athwart 
 which was drawn up, at the time we speak of, in military 
 order, a troop of Pvlartinuzzi's mercenaries. In this 
 gallery, apart from the courtly assemblage, stood Count 
 Ragotzy, unnoticed, as he believed, by any one, gazing 
 abroad, with vacant eye, and evidently sunk deep, in re- 
 verie, or rumination. This gallery, which formed a heavy, 
 and artificial recess in the building, was flanked by a stone 
 balustrade, or parapet of unusual height. It was acces- 
 sible, by means of massive, and folding doors, at present 
 unclosed, which opened, from a sort of semicircular 
 vestibule, within the castle. Here and there, this battle- 
 mented bartizan commanded a striking prospect; it 
 looked out upon the capital, whose " dull palaces, and 
 dirty hovels," as we before stated, were proudly throned, 
 over the shelving site of two detached, but trifling emi- 
 nences, which were united, by a massy gate-way, at the 
 base, or interjacent hollow. 
 
 The city of Hermanstadt, or Czeben, as it is called, by 
 the Hungarians, dominated in the midst of an extensive 
 plain. On one side, it was protected by its powerful 
 citadel, and by the rocky precipice, we before mentioned ; 
 elsewhere it was defended, by massive walls, studded with 
 immense towers, and the fortifications were surrounded 
 by a fosse ; " fort large, et rempli de I'eau de deux ruis- 
 seux qui viennent des montagnes voisines."t 
 
 The eye of Count Ragotzy glanced rapidly over these 
 defences, beyond which, the rays of the sun lighted up

 certain white pavilions, whicli the infidel banners, floating 
 against the sky, proclaimed for an Ottoman encampment. 
 From where the Count was stationed, he might pursue a 
 considerable part of the coarse of the river Olt, as it 
 winded, among a slight ridge of hills, which melt irregu- 
 larly down, into the plains, that abruptly terminate, at the 
 famous ororo-e of the Rothenturn, or Red Tower. To the 
 north, the more level country stretched its huge, and black 
 forests, in graceful outline, till they became lost, in the 
 semicircular chain of the Carpathians. These rugged 
 mountains, that, like an azure girdle, bound the horizon, 
 in the clear distance, seemed to supersede any necessity, 
 for the warrior towers, and bulwarks, which were locked 
 up, in their embraces. 
 
 Such a combination of nature and art, might have well 
 won the chieftain's eye, to dwell delightedly on its beau- 
 ties; but had the panorama even exceeded in loveliness, 
 what we have attempted to describe, which might hardly 
 be to a soldier's thinking,* it would have brought no 
 relief, at that moment, to the stern, and iron colouring of 
 Count Ragotzy's meditations. He leaned, indeed, over 
 the parapet, and to a casual observer, would have seemed 
 to be entranced, with the landscape, which lay, silent, and 
 steeped,, in the plenitude of light, and sunshine, beneath 
 his feet ; but his glances all turned, in reality, to what was 
 imaged, within his ow^n bosom — his mind was its own 
 mirror. He looked on the lineaments of nature, with in- 
 difference, or unconsciousness. He contemplated the 
 deep blue expanse of heaven above him, and beheld the 
 day-god, in his meridian hour, shed virgin light over 
 half the world, with an unheeding eye, and neither did the

 warmth cheer, and fill the soul with serenity, nor the 
 golden shadowless radiance touch, and lay its turbulent 
 passions at rest. Alas ! there is no surer obstacle to such 
 complacency, and pure satisfaction, than the habit of mind, 
 induced by selfishness, and sin; and it would seem to be 
 the intention Qf Providence, that the laudable sensibility 
 to the excellencies of nature (which certainly offer the 
 most unalloyed of sublunary enjoyments,) should be 
 possessed only, by the single-minded, and the " unspotted 
 before the world" — " Sunt, qui formidine nulla imbuti 
 spectent." 
 
 Within the vestibule, or porch to the temple before- 
 mentioned, some of the usual hangers-on, and retainers 
 of a court were assembled, either from duty, or waiting 
 till his eminence should go forth. There, in their official 
 accoutrements, were stationed the familiar servitors of 
 the regent. Pages, and knights, passed and repassed, 
 with business, and anxiety, in their faces. Many, of more, 
 or less note, loitered about, in expectation of an audience ; 
 or, having been just dismissed, lingered, ere they left the 
 castle, and, grouped in separate knots, were lounging, 
 and gossipping together. Among others, two cavaliers 
 were observed conversing, on an easy, and familiar foot- 
 ing, as they leisurely crossed the vestibule. One of these 
 appeared a middle-aged, military-looking sort of per- 
 sonage, of a grave, and noble aspect. If his physiognomy 
 was not indicative of brilliant talents, or much mental de- 
 cision, it was, at least, characteristic, of a mild accommo- 
 dating nature, nor was incompatible, with the possession 
 of a considerable portion of judgment. His forehead was 
 capacious, and the general cast of his features sedate, and 
 prepossessing. This was Valentinian, Count Turascus, 
 general-in-chief of the Hungarian forces. His compa- 
 nion was younger in years, and displayed a greater degree 
 of spirit, in the lines of his countenance; but, on recol- 
 lection, we need not describe him, he being the same 
 young nobleman, who conducted the arrest of Hubert.

 <' Why, i'faith," observed Turascus, in reply to an in- 
 quiry of the baron, '' this is an unaccountable whim of the 
 sultan's herald extraordinary, — for that's the phrase, — 
 since transmitting an ambassador to any power, under the 
 cope of the universe, would imply a certain equality, too 
 glaringly derogatory to the supreme dignity of the mag- 
 nificent Soliman." 
 
 " How long, think you, will the emir persist in re- 
 maining without the walls ? " asked Bathori. 
 
 " Probably, during his tarriance amongst us," said 
 Turascus, " which, however, is of uncertain continuance. 
 You see," he continued, pointing to a magnificent en- 
 campment, established on the banks of the Olt, " where, 
 beneath yon rich pavilion, flaming with silk and gold, 
 Abu Obeida, (that's the intidel's name), at present 
 abideth. A difficulty hath arisen, it seems ; for, however 
 spacious the canvass tenements, he has had pitched for 
 him, they w^ill not contain a moiety of his peacock-train, 
 which is, alike, vast, and gaudy. 
 
 " How has his excellence acted, under such a dilem- 
 ma ? " inquired Bathori. 
 
 " Why, though, for some strange cause, Abu Obeida 
 himself, is unwilling to repose his turbaned head, beneath 
 a Christian's roof," replied Turascus, " he does not enter- 
 tain any repugnance to his attendants taking up their 
 quarters, within our city ; therefore, the regent has given 
 directions, for the waste and ruinous precincts, extending 
 from the back of the High- street, to these castle walls, to 
 be shortly cleared, and covered over with temporary 
 erections, for the accommodation of the greater part of his 
 excellency's retinue." "^ 
 
 " This very dawn," said Bathori, " my duty called me,

 to within a stone's throw of these demesnes ; I had the 
 melancholy task of apprehending the captain of the night- 
 watch." 
 
 " Good God ! and is he a traitor ? " said Turascus. 
 "I passed that man, (Hubert he is called, is he not?) 
 for the first time, the other morning, and I know not 
 what, but something there was about him, which made a 
 deep impression on my mind ; the thought of other days 
 came over me; I could have sworn, only that the thing 
 was impossible, that sweet, and bitter memories were 
 common to us both, from having been acquainted in hap- 
 pier years, when Hungary, Transylvania, and Bohemia, 
 were under one rule, ere ill-fated Lewis, — but 'tis no use 
 lamenting the past," and Turascus turned away his head, 
 and hastily brushed off, from his eyelid, a big drop, which 
 seemed to belie his manhood. 
 
 " General," observed Bathori, after a pause, " I own 
 my surprise at your having only, for the first time, so 
 lately encountered the captain of the night-watch, in 
 Hermanstadt." 
 
 " Why, it has so happened," returned Turascus, 
 " that the routine of his duty has not, till within the last 
 few months, called him to serve with his corps, in this 
 city; and, you know^, I only returned hither last week, 
 after a prolonged absence." 
 
 Bathori was silent. 
 
 "And that man, then, is a treasonable character !" re- 
 sumed Turascus, in a musing, melancholy voice : " alas ! 
 we live in strange times, — God uphold the right ! " 
 
 ''Ay, pray heaven," said Bathori, " our noble regent 
 sit firm ! " 
 
 " I thought not of him," said Turascus, coldly. 
 
 " Prithee, general, of whom else?" inquired Bathori. 
 
 "The Lady Czerina," answered Turascus, with a deep 
 sigh, " and bondaged Erdely. It irks me, they should 
 wear shackles, and I stand by to look on't." With these 
 words, Turascus, taking the arm of his more juvenile

 companion, the two magnates melted from the irregular 
 assemblage, and passed, through the folding doors, into 
 the presence of Martiniizzi. 
 
 Meantime, the busy hum of voices, high in argument, 
 or whispering, in eager consultation, ceased not for an 
 instant. The chief topics of discussion turned, as usual 
 in such caseSj on the tidings of the day : — on the rapid 
 progress the reformed faith was making, throughout 
 Hungary, and Transylvania — the insidious tendency of 
 the present warlike movements of the court of Vienna — 
 the probable conduct of the Sublime Porte thereupon. 
 Then was canvassed the late miraculous evanishment of 
 Count Oldimar, one of the governors of the fortified city 
 of Coloswar, who was reported to have been visited, 
 in bodily presence, by some evil spirit, and borne away, 
 at midnight, in his clutches. 
 
 Another topic of interest was contained in the strange, 
 and weighty intelligence, which had reached Hermanstadt, 
 that morning, of the death of the ferocious freebooter, 
 and renegade, the Waivode, Peter of Moldavia, who, after 
 having, for years, braved the justice of eastern Europe,* 
 was done to death, it was said, by Iwan, one of the Wal- 
 lachian richters. This Iwan, surnamed Vilez,-f although, 
 according to all accounts, a mere youth, had contrived 
 to occupy a considerable space, in the world's eye. His 
 very name was a war-cry among his followers ; and the 
 feats of incredible strength, and bravery, which were cur- 
 rently reported of him, induced an extravagant opinion

 of his prowess. In truth, his beauty, courage, and won- 
 derful endowments were the theme of every tongue. No 
 one knew what was his lineage, or what land gave him 
 birth. He burst on the world with the dignity of a hero, 
 and started, at once, perfect, and in arms, like Sin, from the 
 head of Satan.* Unlike to other marauding Wallachian 
 chiefs, the aged, the helpless and the innocent, were 
 sacred from his attack. No poor man's cottage was ever 
 burnt to the ground, by Vilez Iwan. No worthy Hunga- 
 rian's mansion was liable to Vilez Iwan's night assault — 
 no beautiful maidens, or gallant youths were carried off, 
 to be sold to slavery, by Vilez Iwan. Nor did the Richter 
 exact any contributions, from the wretched natives, for 
 sparing their possessions, and respecting their liberties. 
 The ruthless leader of the Cyganis, and the " Bloody 
 Peter of Moldavia," found, in the redoutable Richter, their 
 mostuncompromising opponent. The whole country hailed 
 him, as another Alcides, born to cleanse the land, in those 
 bad, and broken times. Such were the occurrences, newly in- 
 dexed, by the hand of Time, or whose causes, and consum- 
 mation still lay wrapt, in his dusky folds, and they were 
 discussed, with considerable warmth, and acrimony. But 
 there existed other subjects, which, although, perhaps, 
 " more germane" to the matter, if they happened to be 
 touched upon, it was in a voice, scarcely drawn above the 
 breath ; whilst the obscurest hints, and inuendos were 
 dropped, and passed, from one to the other, respecting 
 the critical situation of Hungary — the rivalship of the 
 regents — of the hostility, in which they held each other — 
 of the resolved, and haughty inflexibility of the queen- 
 mother. And then, as the accents of the speaker died 
 away, in a most oracular whisper, the discourse turned on 
 the melancholy prospects of the youthful Czerina, and 
 sad deductions were drawn, from that lady's hereditary 
 claims, joined with her present position, and the aspiring 
 character of her guardian. The notorious ambition of 
 that personage, unrestrained by fear, or, perhaps, by prin-

 ciple, gave too much reason to suspect him of the worst. 
 It was, indeed, manifest that a kingdom was within his 
 grasp, if the scruples of conscience, or visitings of nature, 
 withheld him not, from stretching forth his hand, to clutch 
 it. That the event was yet delayed, — that the trembling 
 balance of the house of Zapola yet hung suspended, by 
 the master-hand of destiny, was ascribed, by many, to the 
 most guarded circumspection, on the part of Martinuzzi, 
 though, perhaps, from a very few, his abstinence, and mo- 
 deration might not escape the reproach of vacillation, and 
 infirmity of purpose ; but all agreed, that the inclining 
 scale would shortly be decided, by the conjuncture of 
 affairs, in favour of his open assumption of the regal title, 
 and that the grand sequel of the lord regent's policy 
 would, at length, be made clear, as noon-day, by his taking^ 
 that decisive spring, which must secure him the supreme 
 authority, for life. But this object could hardly be at- 
 tained without the ruin of the royal house, and many 
 an unfledged sword was half bared, at the apprehension. 
 The youthful soldier, and the native and fiery nobility, 
 attached to the blood of John of Zapola, and devoted, by 
 loyalty or partizanship, to the service of the Queen-Regent, 
 Isabella, whom their intrigues, or the intrigues of their 
 fathers, had first transplanted from a foreign soil. These, 
 the members of an armed, and lawless aristocracy, it was 
 supposed, were touched, with commiseration, and felt 
 eager to vindicate the rights of loyalty, by inscribing the 
 name, and the injuries of their sovereign, on the banners 
 of rebellion. Still, even the chance of their interference 
 being of service, was a frail one ; and if, as was appre- 
 hended, the ambition of Martinuzzi aspired, beyond the 
 condition of a subject, the days of Czerina were probably 
 numbered. Thus it was agreed, that all was feeble and 
 hollow, in the internal state of Transylvania, whilst every 
 view, from without, bore the most threatening aspect. 
 
 Such were the materials of thought, and action, which 
 rumour, in the full play of her thousand tongues, bruited

 throughout Hermanstadt, and such vrere the " ambiguce 
 voces,'' which she scattered abroad, in the shape of an hy- 
 pothesis, or couched, in the rounding off of some quaint 
 apothegm, no less dark, and enigmatical. But Count Ra- 
 gotzy noted little of all, that was spoken ; he found too 
 much matter, within the repositary of his own bosom, to 
 suffer him to incline a willing ear to inexplicable rumours, 
 and idle speculations ; he remained, where, as he be- 
 lieved, an intervening angle of the parapet, against which 
 his back rested, intercepted him from the view. The 
 longer he revolved his injuries, in the gloomy recesses of 
 his mind, the more his mental irritation wrought on him, 
 till, at length, his voice blasphemed on the air. The smo- 
 thered exclamations, and broken soliloquy, which follow, 
 were interspersed with expletives, which our pen refuses 
 to transcribe. — " Ha ! Peter of Moldavia murdered ! — 
 Martinuzzi, after all, refuse to admit me to his presence ! 
 — The mine undermined ! — from the pride of all my hopes 
 to be plunged into the abyss of utter desperation ! — 
 Cool, cold, dissembling, damned priest! — thou knewest 
 of Peter's death all the while ! — nay, most likely, his as- 
 sassin was thy agent ! Now, by the dames of hell that 
 wait upon him ! I have a mind to mate that man, in his 
 hour of pride. He is a legion of devils to me — shall I 
 hie me to him at once ? — and, — 1 could do that — I 
 
 could ; I have that blazing here, which no ; being 
 
 alone, defenceless, and a Cygani, 'twere sheer madness. 
 He, doubtless, thinks me in his toiles, and his means are 
 such — and such his stretch of authority, that I must not 
 resort to so desperate a measure, while one other expe- 
 dient be left me. At the first word, I spoke, he w^ould 
 order me to be gagged, or himself pierce me on the spot, 
 though that spot were God's altar, he would not hesitate. 
 Oh ! his threats, and actions go together — I know that man 
 well, and what he has at stake ; so I'll take a safer step, 
 and surer — no, I'll wait — I'll not confess, save only at the 
 last extremity. I'll speak to Hubert first, 'tis not too late ;

 come what will — come the worst that may betide ; the 
 possession of these papers, and the contents of that case, 
 are for a rock of dependence, against the tempest. Ha ! 
 after all, the lion, turned to bay, may prove no contempti- 
 ble opponent! — Let the dog spring at his peril ! — Look 
 to it, subtle inquisitor — I'll not be hunted down ! — and 
 now for Hubert." 
 
 Count Ragotzy, having thus arrayed his bad passions 
 in their darkest garb, shifted his ground. In doing so, 
 his eye caught a glimpse of the figure of a man, at some 
 little distance, whom, he had been too much under the 
 dominion of an uncontrollable fury, previously to ob- 
 serve. The form, besides, had been partly shrouded 
 from observation, until that moment, by a projection of 
 the building, beyond which the Cygani chief was posted. 
 He, we speak of, was wrapped in the szurod territs'd, or 
 peasant's cloak, and stood, or rather reclined his back, 
 against the wall, while eying the soliloquist, with no 
 little earnestness. That person naturally started at the 
 thought, that he might have been overheard, and, laying 
 his hand upon his dagger, vainly endeavoured to recal to 
 mind the precise words of his monologue, so as to deter- 
 mine, whether he had not betrayed himself. On this 
 head, he remained at a loss, but the self-possession and 
 intrepidity, annexed to his character, did not desert him. 
 In any point of view, he thought his most advisable 
 course would be to pass the stranger, without taking any 
 notice of him. He, therefore, walked forward; but, ere 
 he reached the folding-portal, the other was at his elbow. 
 In a deep, abrupt, but silver-toned voice, the stranger 
 spoke : " My Lord !" The count stopped short, as the 
 man, with still more emphatic intonation, reiterated, 
 '' Lord Ragotzy." The Cygani suddenly fronted the 
 man, and endeavoured to read his purpose, in his counte- 
 nance. His sallow complexion, the uneasy working of 
 his nether lip, and the inconstant, yet, at times, pierc- 
 ing expression of the eye, formed a portent, by no means

 prepossessing, and, combined, with his other characteris- 
 tics, to warn the count to put himself upon his guard. 
 He appeared to be of middle age, and was slenderly 
 made ; but, however diminutive in stature, his limbs 
 were symmetrically moulded. 
 
 The brigand weuld again have pursued his way. These 
 startling words arrested his step — " Is Lord Ragotzy be- 
 reaved of his senses, that, at noon-day, he utters aloud his 
 malisons, in the strong hold of him, he deems, and pro- 
 claims his enemy ?" 
 
 " What say you, sir ?" returned the count, in surprise 
 at the tone, and tenor of the other's address. 
 
 " Methinks my words need no translation," said the 
 man, in a low mysterious tone. " Other palace walls, 
 than those of Dionysius, have been reputed to have hear- 
 ing, and these walls! w^hich, on all sides, describe the 
 iron circle of despotism — why, Lord Ragotzy, there's 
 not a coigne of vantage but hath its tell-tale funnel ; 
 there's not a buttress, behind which lurks not an eve's- 
 dropper, and every parapet owns many a spiracle, by 
 which the voice of disaffection finds its way, to the ears 
 of tyranny. What think you. Count Ragotzy, when I, 
 who am planted on this spot, with orders to watch, and 
 report your movements, — I tell you, to your face, you are 
 in danger." This was delivered, in a voice, which it was 
 impossible could escape notice. 
 
 The count was staggered — " In danger I" he repeated, 
 " from whom ? — of what ?" 
 
 The stranger raised his arm, and pointed significantly, 
 towards the door of the ante-room. 
 
 " What is it, sir, that you would have me understand 
 from this — I comprehend you not — speak out, or let 
 me proceed — you are silent — stand by." With these 
 words, as if suddenly resolved not to be trifled with any 
 longer, he moved forward. 
 
 The unknown retired, slowly, in his front. " Beware 
 of those men, who await your coming, at the doors, lead-

 ing to the hall of state," he said, in a sort of cautionary 
 whisper. 
 
 " Await my coming!" echoed the count, again paus- 
 ing — " explain yourself." 
 
 " My lord," answered the other, with an astute smile, 
 but still in the same low key, " I have said enough, if 
 you please to understand me — if not, perchance too 
 much." 
 
 The brow of Count Ragotzy darkened : again he fixed 
 his eye keenly on the fronti nulla fides of the speaker, 
 where a self-asserting reserve of irony seemed to indicate 
 a character, obscure, and problematical, at the best, and 
 which, the more the bandit studied, the more he felt at 
 a loss to decipher. A new suspicion, all at once, darted 
 within him. " Ha ! I see," cried he, while his face 
 gloomed, on the stranger, like a thunder-cloud — " thou 
 dost this only, to play upon my fears; whether prompted, 
 by avidity of gain, or governed, by a sportful wanton 
 humour, matters not, — I warn you, however, once 
 more, not to push my patience too far — I am not the 
 sort of man, 1 suspect you deem me, nor in a frame of 
 mind, to brook your practices ; so make way !" The 
 stranger offered no reply, but seemed still disposed, by 
 planting himself full in the count's path, to oppose his 
 further progress. Ragotzy, whose irritability of tem- 
 perament was at no time very amenable to control, felt 
 nettled, at the fellow's pertinacity, and, after vainly again 
 attempting to rid himself of his attendance, turned upon 
 him, with a flushed brow, and an eye of fire. " Villain ! 
 stand on one side," he exclaimed. 
 
 The other, nevertheless, persisted in his endeavours, to- 
 impede his steps, saying, at the same time, with that pro- 
 voking nonchalance, which predominated, in his whole 
 demeanour, " Would you speak with that man, you call 
 Hubert, methinks, you go the right way about it." 
 
 These few words effectually attained their purpose. 
 Count Ragotzy turned abruptly round, and, fronting his

 officious interlocutor, said, whilst he searched, with steady, 
 and piercing glance, the uncertain map of his counte- 
 nance, '^ So, it seems, there is more in this, than mere 
 impertinence ; come, I ivill sift this matter. Rascal, 
 you've crossed a man, who, tottering on the verge of the 
 black desert, that. lies beyond the grave, recks nought — 
 nought, human, or divine — so mark me, sirrah, this cold 
 iron, which I now lay bare, shall be presently crimsoned 
 v,'ith thy heart's blood, unless you declare, why you beset 
 my path." 
 
 The man shrunk back, for a moment, and then, in the 
 most imperturbable manner, shrugged his shoulders, as, 
 with an apparently assured voice, he replied, " I am here 
 to do you service ; but I shall make known just so much 
 of my purpose, as seems to me meet, and not a syllable 
 beyond, only ;" he added, drawing nearer, and lowering 
 his voice, almost to a whisper, "• prithee put up your 
 dagger, lest it attract the eyes of yon idlers. If you will, 
 let us confer apart — this way. Lord Ragotzy." 
 
 The speaker forthwith directed his footsteps to the 
 further end of the gallery, where he halted. His 
 effrontery failed not to produce its effect upon Ragotzy, 
 who, after musing for an instant, returned his weapon 
 to its sheath, and then stalked after his strange ad- 
 monisher. Having come within a few paces of where the 
 man stood, the count, at once, renewed the conversation. 
 " Whoever thou art," he said, " and by whatever mo- 
 tives actuated, thou canst, it is clear, discover, what it 
 behoves me to hear ; so first tell me concerning Hubert ?" 
 
 ** One answer will suffice," replied the man ; then, 
 suddenly d^eepening his tone, and coming closer to the 
 bandit — "Lord Ragotzy," he subjoined, "you are 
 watched by men, armed, and appointed for the purpose, 
 who have directions to detain you by force, if you ad- 
 vance a step, beyond those inner doors, towards the re- 
 gent's presence-chamber. In that case, you will pro-

 bably be plunged, into one of those pleasant domiciles, 
 where, even now, your confederate lies imprisoned." 
 
 " My confederate !" echoed the count, in alarm ; — 
 *' How! Hubert? it must be — it is Hubert! Speak 
 out ! whom mean you?" And then, with an impulse of 
 the breath, which he could hardly be said to vocalize, 
 his articulation, if such indeed it were, more resembling 
 the gasp of the screech-owl, than any known sound of 
 human utterance, he repeated, " whom?" 
 
 His looks, as he paused for a reply, grew black and 
 portentous, as a thunder-cloud. The other recoiled a 
 pace, before his flushed countenance, and swelling figure; 
 and it was only, after a minute's space, that he made 
 answer, in a low voice, " Him, you named — Hubert." 
 
 Count Ragotzy uttered a single groan, that scared 
 forth the nestled raven from her " procreant cradle," 
 who, mistaking the sound, that thrilled through the air, 
 for the signal of her mate, croaked back her hoarse 
 response ; then, flapping her enormous plumes against 
 the wind, the bird drooped from her sphere, traced a wild, 
 and magic circle, right over their heads, and again darted 
 upwards, into the heavens. Some minutes elapsed, ere 
 another word was spoken, either by the count or his 
 companion. The former, at length, stamping upon the 
 ground with vehemence, as the foam flew from his lips, 
 exclaimed, " Oh, that this priest, and I were now, on a 
 rough sea, with but a plank of a split ship betwixt us, and 
 perdition ! — may these two arms shrivel up, if they did 
 not plunge him down to the world of waters ! Isten !" * 
 he proceeded, whilst, with outstretched hands, he grasped 
 at the impassive air, on which his straining eyes were 
 bent, as if the element were something palpable — 
 '' Isten ! or rather let me invoke — if such immortal na- 
 tures be — Mano If only grant, I may, one day, clutch this

 subtle-winged serpent by the throat, and strangle him by 
 inches, till he chokes his last !" 
 
 The fury of Ragotzy was terrible ; yet the other looked 
 on, with a hard, and scoffing smile. " Excuse me, my 
 lord," he observed, in a somewhat expostulatory tone ; 
 ^' but this is idle, — wouldstthou have atonement ?" 
 
 "To be sure I would, and will," replied Ragotzy, 
 with the accent, and attitude of an exterminating spirit — 
 "Yet no," he presently added, "not atonement, but 
 more, sir, I '11 have vengeance ! — Ay, though that packet, 
 and my golden prize be lost to me, — which I do not be- 
 lieve, — for ever, I'll find modes of vengeance !" 
 
 " Why so you may be avenged, in fitting time," re- 
 plied the other ; " but now, you stand at disadvantage ; — 
 spies are about, and you speak loud in wrath." 
 
 " Spies I — though the air were bribed to serve the 
 tyrant, I 'd speak the thoughts that bustle for a vent ; 
 ay, if I burst, out they should go." 
 
 " Beshrew thy intemperance, my lord — list to a tale : 
 After you and Father Dominick, as the style goeth, parted 
 company last night, each imagined that the other had 
 retired to rest ; yet both went about their proper busi- 
 ness. The monk, as ever, succeeded, in what he under- 
 took, but thou wert foiled, Lord Ragotzy, as thou 
 deservedst." 
 
 The Cygani would have gazed at the speaker, but, in 
 his turn, met a look, whose unwinking fascination, like a 
 spell, seemed to penetrate his very soul. Wincing under 
 that fixed, and caustic survey, he lowered his eyes. 
 
 " Father Dominick's object," continued the stranger, 
 " was, as you guess, the causing Hubert to be appre- 
 hended. And your's, — " 
 
 " Hold there!" interrupted the count, in a subdued 
 voice; "wert thou cognizant of what thy speech infer- 
 reth, thou art not mortal. But one, who breathes the 
 vital air, might guess at it; nor he, only that, years ago, 
 I " he ceased abruptly.

 " You would have enacted a similar tragedy, my 
 lord," broke in the other, in the same bold, and superior 
 tone, he had adopted from the first; " you meant, last 
 night, to do a deed, whose very imagination is chronicled 
 in hell, branding your soul with such ransomless perfidy, 
 as not all the fires of purgatory, through countless ages, 
 might regenerate. A deed, Lord Ragotzy, and that, in 
 the holy and amazed light of dawn, which midnight hath 
 no pall, so heavy as to hide, — it is so wicked. Think 
 you, the after-baptism, of burning lava, that priests prate 
 of, was ordained for such motiveless malevolence as 
 yours? Trust me, otherwise, my lord: trust me, otherwise'." 
 It would be hard to say, whether surprise, or resentment, 
 held most sway, in the bosom of Ragotzy, at that moment. 
 He felt the hot blood start rapidly through his veins. 
 Thrice, he involuntarily laid his hand, on the hilt of his 
 sword, and as often left the weapon in the scabbard, un- 
 drawn. In the end, however, his amazement, mixed, 
 possibly, with some undefined, and unwonted emotions of 
 shame, mastered his rising anger; and, curbing his na- 
 tural temper, as well as he could, he addressed the other, 
 though, evidently, in a constrained tone. 
 
 *' Well, then, you are acquainted with circumstances," 
 he said, ''which, I had supposed, only hell and myself 
 were cognizant of. How you came by your knowledge, 
 you best can tell. I look at you with all the powers of 
 vision I possess. You appear to be mortal man. It is 
 inexplicable to me, yet so it is; but tell me — do you, — " 
 he ceased abruptly, as if gasping for breath, and looked 
 at the other, with wistful earnestness, for above a minute, 
 without again opening his mouth. His tones, and gesture 
 implied the most mysterious, and awful apprehension of 
 the" sense of what, he was about to ask, whilst, speaking 
 articularly between his teeth, and under his breath, yet 
 with solemn energy, he demanded, " Do you know 
 more ?" 
 
 '* That question I must be excused answering," replied

 the stranger, with a glance, into which was thrown no 
 small portion of sarcastic expression: — "Thus much, 
 however," and the lips of the man curled, with a bitter 
 smile, ** I would whisper to thy conscience. Thou hast 
 served thy apprenticeship to the Cygani, Unna, and art 
 thyself, I wis, the deader of her Pharaoh nepec,* and 
 their trade is blood." Ragotzy shrunk back, in excess of 
 amazement. '' But," presently resumed the other, " let 
 us consult for your present safety. Say, you see Hubert, 
 and arm him with fortitude, to endure the evils of the 
 time." 
 
 Ragotzy pondered for a moment, ere he replied; — 
 " Who thou art, I know not ; what interest thou canst 
 have in my affairs, I cannot tell; nor by what sorcery, 
 thou hast gathered thy intelligence, have I a conception: 
 but this I know, out of thine own mouth thou betrayest 
 thyself. How should I speak with Hubert, when, as 
 you said but now, he is in durance?" 
 
 " It might not be impossible, I ween," returned the 
 other, " to bid the bolts of his dungeon shoot back. And 
 though but one man in Hermanstadt, save him you wot 
 of, could bring an interview to bear, I can name that 
 man." 
 
 '* By'r, lady!" exclaimed the count, "is it credible, 
 that corruption can unbar the gates of the state-prison 
 of Hermanstadt? who is he of whom you speak?" 
 
 " Viscount Rodna, the lunatic," replied the stranger, 
 coolly; *' the ward of Martinuzzi." 
 
 Ragotzy was mute with astonishment, for a moment ; 
 when, fastening his dark eyes upon the imperturbable 
 face of the speaker, he began to fancy, the features were 
 not wholly strange to him. " And, in the Mano's name! 
 who art thou?" he breathlessly demanded. 
 
 " I, my lord!" drily answered the man, with a smile, 
 that resembled a sneer; "I am Luke Swartz, Count 
 
 * Pharaoh's people, the Hungarian appellation of gipsies.

 Rodna's keeper, at your service." The sudden rush of 
 thought, attendant on his instant recognition of the in- 
 dividual before him, palsied the beatings of Count Ra- 
 gotzy's heart. He felt angry at his previous dulness. 
 The manner of Swartz, from the very first, had haunted 
 him with vague reminiscences, for which, since the mo- 
 tives, which governed the fellow, were as impenetrable, as 
 those of some visor'd mute, he could not assign any 
 precise cause; but now, the impression was accounted 
 for, by the peculiar associations, connected with this 
 person. The keeper seem.ed to apprehend the conflicting 
 thoughts he had, in a manner, raised in the head of Ra- 
 gotzy, and his lip slightly curled, with the anguis in 
 herbd of his characteristic sneer. 
 
 " Well," said the satirist,* if we may be allowed so to 
 accommodate his phrase, " 'Tis hard not to indulge in 
 quizzing." If Count Ragotzy caught the momentary 
 expression, which pursed up his companion's countenance, 
 he did not deign to notice it. He traversed the gallery, with 
 hasty and irregular steps, backwards and forwards ; then 
 turning shortly round, he dem.anded where he was likely 
 to meet with the young count? 
 
 *' Your movements are beset," began the keeper, after 
 a pause. 
 
 " Laissez faire a Don Antoine," interrupted Ra- 
 gotzy, touching with his finger the hilt of his sword. 
 "This passport, sir, hath borne me through worse dangers 
 than now environ me. I knew this citadel, when but an 
 urchin, and all its windings and turnings are as familiar 
 to my recollection, as is the tortuous policy of its lord." 
 
 " Where doth Count Rodna lodge ?" 
 
 " Of what passes, between you and that youth, I will be 
 the medium," replied Swartz gravely. 
 
 Deeply annoyed was Ragotzy, at finding himself so 
 absolutely dependent upon the good oflftces of one, whom

 he considered so much his inferior, and in whose regard, 
 he began to entertain a sentiment of aversion, whilst 
 there involuntarily mingled with his antipathy, something, 
 that resembled anxiety ; it was impossible, it could be 
 fear ; but there was no help for it ; so, endeavouring to 
 hide his vexation, he said, in an indifferent tone, "I cannot 
 conjecture, what purpose thou hast to serve, that thou 
 forcest thyself, on the dangerous councils of a man, like 
 me." 
 
 Swartz, fixing an eye of earnest regard upon the chief- 
 tain, replied, " I should suppose as much. — Well, please 
 to hear my explanation, my lord" — he stopped, and after a 
 minute's inward cogitation, thus, with solemn countenance, 
 and deep, impressive voice, resumed — " A valued friend 
 of mine — that is, I would say," he added, quickly cor- 
 recting himself, 'Miis near relation — I speak of time past 
 — was cruelly and scandalously wronged by that indivi- 
 dual, upon whose head, I overheard you imprecate re- 
 venge. The king dying — I mean, my lord, the friend I 
 mentioned, hath measured, in his secret soul, the provoca- 
 tion and the penalty. He, and I, — yes, T, — oh, how I 
 loved once ! and with no adulterate fondness ; but my 
 broken sighs were spent on air, and that man eclipsed me 
 in the affections of the lady of my homage." The keeper 
 turned his head on one side, as if to hide his counte- 
 nance. 
 
 " Thou love I" muttered Ragotzy ; "one would ima- 
 gine thy heart to have been all brains." 
 
 *' Is't not enough?" continued the speaker, with startling 
 emphasis; "then, hear further — The child of a noble, 
 though decayed family — a fair and blue-eyed girl, born 
 a Hungarian, was my sister. One only, very fair, as I 
 said, and young, and warm, and oh ! her hair was like 
 the sunbeams, and her voice, voluptuous, was so very 
 sweet, 'twas painful. She came to know him, and, 'twas 
 rumoured, he was too familiar." — Here, for an instant, 
 the sallow face of the speaker assumed a lustre, as if

 tlie blood, that flowed in his veins had been fire, and had 
 rushed, from his whole body, to illuminate his features. 
 Count Ragotzy gazed astonished. 
 
 "I cannot talk of this," he went on; "the rumour 
 was a lie. Within her patient heart she locked his image, 
 and the restless guest wore out its tenement — that's all! 
 He, my lord, allured her into the darksome void of the 
 tomb, and smiled the while. — Enough; she died of love — 
 of the blight of singleness. She died of love, unrequited, 
 unsatisfied, and, as yet, unavenged. But now, he's rank 
 i' the wind, my lord — that priest; and vengeance — sure, as 
 the slow hound of fate, or the famed Spartan dog, of scent 
 sagacious,* shall dodge the traitor to his doom, let him 
 double and turn, however he will." There was a minute's 
 pause. 
 
 " And you hope to find an active coadjutor in me, hey, 
 sir?" observed the Cygani, with atone of scorn. 
 
 " Truly, my lord," replied Swartz, " we are glad to 
 press into our service any collateral aid, that presents it- 
 self, and your courses, and ours seem to hold together, — 
 at least for awhile. One partizan we have, by the way — 
 a Wallachian — now in this city — ay, living within a stone's 
 throw of these ramparts, whose resurrection, after having 
 long been supposed dead, would startle and make pale, I 
 ween, the good citizens of Hermanstadt. But yourself, 
 my lord, are meant to do most active, and important 
 service. It was with the view of turning your animosity 
 to our purposes, — of enlisting it, in revenge of my friend's 
 and my own injuries, that I broke upon you, with that 
 admonitory address, which preluded our present confer- 
 ence. Be sure, lord Ragotzy, had you proceeded into 
 the hall of audience, as you were about to do, when I in- 
 terfered, your arrest would have been inevitable, and 
 now-a-days, the prisons of Hermanstadt, I need not tell 
 you, are much the same, as her charnel houses." There

 was silence for several minutes. The countenances of 
 both, from different causes, darkened. Count Ragotzy 
 naturally felt a degree of pleasure, at finding, he had 
 so able an auxiliary at hand, at a time, too, when he 
 so greatly stood in need of his agency. In yielding, how- 
 ever, to his first impulse of satisfaction, he deemed 
 it unwise, entirely to surrender himself to it. At all 
 events, he resolved, ere he embarked in dangerous, and 
 concealed intrigues, to proceed with circumspection, and 
 look well, lest that mysterious tale of enmity, he hardly 
 understood, should prove a mere fiction, to answer some 
 sinister purpose of the relator. 
 
 With this end in view, in rejoinder to the other's nar- 
 ration, the count, after awhile, observed, " That, which 
 you have told me, may be veritable, but you cannot ex- 
 pect me to credit so strange a coincidence of policy, as 
 would seem to exist between us, upon your unsupported 
 testimony. Who, and what is this friend, whose cause 
 you seem so warmly to have espoused ?" 
 
 " On that head, I am pledged to secresy," answered 
 the man ; " but I fable not ; and, as security for the truth 
 of my averment, without which, our compact were bound 
 by a cable of sand, I am authorized to offer you such 
 hostage, as will be irresistible." 
 
 "What hostage speak you of?" said the count, into 
 whose features every additional syllable, spoken by the 
 keeper, seemed to conjure new wonder. 
 
 " Even the person of my wretched charge," answered 
 Swartz. " I will deposit him in your hands : you can 
 immure him — (the man hesitated for a few seconds, and 
 then continued carelessly) — where you will, so that he be 
 kept out of the way. Sigismund is held by Martinuzzi 
 in no ordinary regard ; he takes a deeper interest in the 
 fate of his poor protege, than is supposed ; and it would 
 be as much, as my life is worth, were I to be met in the 
 streets of Hermanstadt, after the intelligence shall reach 
 the cardinal, of the unhappy creature's disappearance.

 Fancy not, I would so commit myself, unless, with all my 
 nerves, I were prepared to further your purposes, till time 
 waken truth." 
 
 " It may be so," said Ragotzy ; ^' but I do not under- 
 stand, where is the mighty gain of keeping custody over a 
 madman." 
 
 " If YOU do not. Count Ragotzy, ask your mother," 
 replied Swartz, with a mysterious air. ''Bid her rate the 
 value of my pledge, and act accordingly." 
 
 After a minute's deep rumination, the count said, but 
 as if speaking to himself, rather than addressing his 
 companion, " I must, at all events, have free discourse 
 of Hubert, and hear his report of where he has hidden 
 those treasures. In every way, I am unfortunate, and 
 this untimely murder of the waivode has disconcerted my 
 best-devised projects." 
 
 " Ha ! that last was an ugly accident for the politics 
 of the House of Polgar," interposed Swartz, fixing one of 
 his peculiar, and sinister smiles, on the features of Ragotzy. 
 
 The count's eye caught that most fiend-like scrutiny, 
 and, if he shrank at the allusion to his family name, from 
 a perfect stranger, he was even still more revolted, by the 
 man's accompanying smile. He kept, however, a digni- 
 fied silence, and Swartz resumed. 
 
 " The bloody Peter little apprehended what arm he 
 had to encounter, when he dared cross the mighty Iwan." 
 
 " That name," cried Ragotzy, " runs through me like 
 a fever : but, sir, what mean you ? The public rumour 
 goes, he, Iwan, murdered Peter." 
 
 "Ay, in single combat," returned Swartz. 
 
 "Have you heard how the encounter came about ?" 
 inquired Ragotzy, somewhat nettled ; " since, methinks, 
 thou art privy to the whole world's doings." 
 
 " Why, I know a thing or two, I believe," answered 
 Swartz ; " and, only, that I think you would not care to 
 have me describe the particulars, I could inform you, how 
 the Moldavian came by his death."

 *' You mistake; I would willingly learn," said Ra- 
 gotzy. 
 
 " As you will, count," responded Swartz ; and his 
 keen eye seemed to reach the seat of those thoughts, 
 which the other would gladly have hidden. 
 
 " You may rementber," he presently began, " you 
 left your trusty, and most meet ally, with his ancient 
 Romans, encamped on the plain of Thomash. There 
 they were directed to w^ait your orders, and hold them- 
 selves in readiness to march, at an hour's notice." 
 
 *• And so they were," exclaimed Ragotzy, involun- 
 tarily. 
 
 *' Ha! you see all vaticination is not monopolized, as 
 you Egyptians pretend, by your precious race," cried 
 Swartz, in a sneering tone. " Well," he continued, in a 
 quiet, regulated voice, " on the uprising of the day after 
 your departure from the camp, tidings were brought, that 
 the Richter Iwan had taken up his position, on a neigh- 
 bouring height. Peter, at first, arose in a fury, and went 
 without his tent, to view the forces of the audacious in- 
 truder. He saw, he outnumbered the Richter, ten to one. 
 So Peter forthwith waxed valiant, and sent a herald to 
 demand, what the Richter meant, by encamping in his 
 neighbourhood. Iwan returned some scornful, and eva- 
 sive answer or other, v/hereupon Peter grew even more 
 enraged, and directed the lines of the Richter to be 
 assaulted, with all the strength, he could muster. Thrice 
 that day did he expose himself to imminent peril, in per- 
 sonal conflicts, with the gallant band of Iwan, leading to 
 the attack the choicest followers of his standard, each 
 time to be repulsed, with considerable loss. You may 
 have heard of the beautiful gipsy, who had lately be- 
 come the property of this dreadful man ?" 
 
 " I have seen the Kurva^'' said Ragotzy, in a low, dry 
 tone, and turning away his head. 
 
 " On the following day," proceeded the keeper, "Peter 
 escorted her, for greater security, to the town of Kilien-

 fala, which, as you are aware, is situate, some league and 
 a half, north of the Waivode's station. During Peter's 
 absence, the opportunity was laid hold of to introduce 
 spies, and emissaries into his camp, and before the Wai- 
 vode's return, more than a fourth of his followers had 
 gone over to the Wallachian Richter. You may imagine 
 the transports of rage, into which this intelligence threw 
 the Waivode. To guard against further defection, he 
 denounced death, by the extremest torture, to any of his 
 men, who should be caught exchanging a word, with the 
 adverse outposts. Despite, however, of all Peter could 
 do to prevent it, day after day, successive numbers con- 
 trived to desert to the opposite ranks, till those of the 
 Waivode were thinned to nearly half their original comple- 
 ment. Things were in this state, when, early one morning, 
 Peter happened to be journeying, on horseback, over 
 the wild tract of wood, that stretches beyond Kilienfala, 
 where, according to custom, he had been keeping vigils, 
 with his fair companion. He was unattended, and had, 
 already, measured the greater extent of the forest, when 
 his ears caught the sound of hurrying horses' feet, in the 
 direction he had just traversed. Misdoubtful, whether 
 the approaching tramp might betoken the pursuit of 
 friends, or foes, he spurred on, at full speed, when, in 
 the act of turning an angle of the beaten chaussee, he was 
 set upon, by a party of horsemen, who, starting from an 
 adjoining coppice, had evidently been lying in wait, 
 against his arrival. You know the daring courage, and 
 intrepidity of the man, and his first intention seems to 
 have been, to cut his way through the opposing force, 
 and trust, for the rest, to the fleetness of his horse. He 
 failed, however, owing, probably, to the animal's being 
 somewhat spent with travel, in executing his pur- 
 pose ; and so, drawing in rein, he put himself on his de- 
 fence.

 tone.

 hoofs, he had before heard, in the distance, came up at 
 a gallop. They were two, simply clad, in that sort of 
 half-military garb, which the disturbed state of the dis- 
 trict warranted. The younger, loosing the bridle of his 
 steed, dashed the rowels into his sides, and drew up, on 
 the spot, where, flushed and panting, Peter stood at 
 bay ; and, while the horseman's bright eye flashed, in 
 emulation of his streaming sword, he shouted, in a voice, 
 that rang through the air, like a trumpet, ' The regent's 
 name ! In the sacred names of country, and of freedom, 
 defiance to your regent! His outstretched, tyrant arm, 
 is far too short to reach us here ; nor shall he make this 
 gentleman another of the victims of his insatiate am- 
 bition.' 
 
 "The astonished assailants were staggered, for an 
 instant, by the suddenness of the onset ; but quickly, 
 and sternly recovering, they rushed forward, at the com- 
 mand of Balassi, to slay, or make captive, all three 
 traitors. The inequality of numbers would seem to have 
 augured only one issue, and that a speedy one. But 
 the party of Balassi closed on no ordinary adversaries ; 
 and it was soon seen, what the terrible energy of brave 
 men could effect, against fearful odds. 
 
 " You are acquainted with the prodigious strength of 
 the gigantic Peter, and can bear witness to his warlike 
 prowess ; but, to conceive the velocity of his young as- 
 sistant's movements, and the nice, and desperate rapid- 
 ity of his strokes, you must have been present." 
 
 " Without interrupting you," said Ragotzy, who 
 seemed very attentive, " I would inquire, whether you 
 yourself were in the fray, that you describe so well ? " 
 
 " [ was so," quietly replied Swartz ; " but you shall

 hear. Nothing, I assure you," he proceeded, " could 
 withstand, for an instant, that astonishing scymetar. 
 Two of his opponents were dashed from their seats to 
 the earth. The rest soon gave ground, and, ultimately, 
 took to flight. In vain Nadastis exhorted ; in vain 
 Balassi, by voice and gesture, would have rallied them, 
 to resume the contest. The panic was fairly sped ; the 
 fugitives gave their steeds the rein, leaving two of their 
 party dead, on the field of battle. 
 
 " ' Gallant sir,' cried Peter, when he had recovered 
 breath, ' to whose resistless arm am I indebted, for so 
 great a service ? ' 
 
 " ' When I can say, I am worthy of the name, I may 
 some time have to uphold, and am certified what that 
 name demands of me, I will acknowledge myself; till 
 when, excuse me, gracious sir,' replied the young de- 
 liverer : * but may I inquire,' he presently subjoined, 
 ' to whom I have the honour of addressing myself?' 
 
 *' ' I am the Waivode of Moldavia, and a prince of 
 Wallachia,' replied Peter, in so arrogant a tone, as if 
 he would have struck his hearers into the earth, by the 
 announcement of his formidable titles* 
 
 " 'Thou the waivode!' cried the other, with undis- 
 sembled consternation. 
 
 " ' I am that prince,' was the rejoinder. 
 
 " ' Gracious heavens !' exclaimed the intrepid youth — 
 ' and do I at last behold, with my own eyes, Peter the 
 Bloody ? — Peter the murderer ? — Peter the abhorred 
 of all Hungary ? Art thou that creature, and yet no 
 leprosy upon thee V 
 
 " ' What audacious boy is this V cried the waivode — 
 ' devil's luck ! art foregone in mind ? Now, bloody as 
 I'm given out, I were loath to raise my arm against my 
 preserver, those words were, else, thy last. Thou art one 
 of the lacqueys of the Richter, I reckon, hey, lad ? and 
 art taught to expect preferment, by abusing thy lord's 
 betters ? Come, wear my colours, and quit that milk-

 livered chieftain. Thou hast given me good reason to 
 know, thou art well worth thy appointment, and I happen 
 to have a service to put thee on, will need mettle such 
 as thine.' 
 
 " 'The Richter Iwan acknowledges no lord living for 
 his betters,' said the companion of the youth, who had 
 not before spoken. 
 
 " 'Then ye are his soldiers — I guessed as much; I 
 owe your lord a long score, and for nothing more cer- 
 tainly, than his present daily attempts to corrupt my 
 warriors. Vengeance is sometimes tardy, but I wait my 
 time. It is my boast, sir, that no man ever yet injured 
 me, who was long lived.' 
 
 " 'If you consider the Richter in that predicament,' 
 observed the same speaker, ' your boast, in his regard, 
 may turn out but a braggart's trust.' 
 
 " ' Does he wear charms V said Peter, scornfully ; • — 
 ' you may tell your lord to have a care, I shall find him 
 when he least counts on it — if on the battle-field, well ; 
 but if not, he may drop some hour to sleep on his pillow, 
 and wake .... I have myself witnessed more than one 
 such surprising decease.' 
 
 " ' And been a main instrument of that effect, or thou 
 art universally belied,' observed his rescuer. 
 
 " 'Young sir,' returned Peter, 'what I do, I dare 
 vindicate — I never deny my deeds ; but here our paths 
 separate — my videttes are within hail. Bear arms with 
 me, and let us on together, or for your own sakes, part 
 company.' There was a pause, but the two seemed un- 
 willing to depart. 
 
 " ' Prince,' said the younger, at length, ' you were 
 right in supposing us to be Iwan's men, but it does not 
 follow, we may not tire of his command, as, it is reported, 
 your troops do of yours. Say, we take service with you, 
 will you furnish us with a speedy occasion, to requite the 
 Richter for certain slights, he has lately cast on both 
 of us?'

 Beyond my hopes !' exclaimed Peter — ' as ye 
 will, gallant gentlemen, but I may not have ray purpose 
 forestalled ; —the Richter I wan shall fall, by this arm 
 alone. Bring us where our swords may arbitrate our 
 quarrel ; only accomplish that, and you may redeem the 
 obligation, at the price of a moiety of my revenues. I 
 swear to ye — I, who have seen more than fifty blos- 
 soming summers — that my soul ne'er panted for any 
 joy, and any advantage of conquest or renown, with half 
 the eagerness, it yearns to set eyes on that insulting 
 springald, Richter Iwan. Though he were encompassed 
 with all the circumstance of war, and nought but this 
 right arm, and the strength of my deeply sworn hatred to 
 spirit me ; alone I'd dash aside his guards and officers, 
 and, with one blow, cleave him down.' 
 
 " ' If,' returned the other, coolly, * to see your enemy 
 at your feet, alone and sleeping, would give you any 
 satisfaction, we can do as much.' 
 
 " ' Where ? when ? how ?' hurriedly demanded the 
 waivode. 
 
 " ' In his tent — to-night — we are of his body guard ; 
 it can be compassed, but our terms must first be sub- 
 scribed.' 
 
 " ' Propound them,' said the waivode. 
 
 " ' Our object is the Richter's death ; — give us your 
 oath, prince, that you will not depart the tent of Iwan, till 
 the life-blood of one or other determine your difl?erence,' 
 
 " ' Gramercy ! good youth, but that's letting me off 
 easy,' returned the waivode — ' I swear !' 
 
 " ' Well, remember !' cried the young champion. 
 
 " The three then proceeded to mature their plan, and 
 it was resolved to put it into execution that coming 
 night. How the matter was arranged, it were tedious to 
 detail : suffice it to mention, that, at midnight, the wai- 
 vode found himself, in a compartment of the tent of his 
 enemy. In the dark, and alone, he waited awhile the 
 coming of his confederates, to conduct him to the help-

 less couch of I wan. Soon one entered, wlio> plucking 
 him by the sleeve, instructed him to follow. Through 
 a Dsedalian labyrinth of canvass, and tent ropes, still in 
 the dark, he tracked the steps of his companion: at 
 length, they were stopped by a sort of arched doorway, 
 deep within a wall of stone. Arrived beneath this porch, 
 the guide of Peter indicated the handle of a narrow 
 postern. * Enter boldly,' he whispered, ' I have cleared 
 the coast : within, you will find the Richter — he sleeps.' 
 
 " The waivode accordingly pushed the door violently 
 open, and rushed forward with drawn sword; but imme- 
 diately he stopped short, blinded, by the blaze of innu- 
 merable pendant lamps that suddenly shone forth, shed- 
 ding their light beyond the extended portal. He stood 
 at the entrance of this long illuminated room, whose 
 whole extent was flanked on either side, with officers and 
 chieftains, glittering in the pomp, and pageantry of 
 military array. At the extremity of the saloon, beneath 
 a canopy of state, was seated the Richter Iwan, on an 
 elevated dais, or platform. Peter seemed astounded, but 
 only for a moment, for quickly rallying, and utteiing the 
 one word, betrayed! he dashed through the wide lane, 
 formed by the surprised host; and, ere an eye could 
 twinkle, reached the upper end of the apartment, where 
 Iwan, who had instantly risen on his intrusion, stood 
 self-possessed and calm. Already was the foot of Peter 
 on the step of the dais, whilst his eagle eye searched out 
 the Richter. In the same instant of time, the waivode's 
 unerring arm was uplifted, and his bright falchion was 
 seen glancing in the torch light, as if, with the irresistible 
 will of fate. 
 
 *' * Welcome, prince l' cried Iwan, with a voice of com- 
 posed, yet terrible grandeur, whilst, with proud humility, 
 he raised, for an instant, the cap of maintenance from 
 his head. Peter shrunk back. His piercing eyes receded 
 in their sockets, and the extended arm and weapon, just 
 raised to strike, sunk slowly by his side: — 'Welcome,

 prince! Thou hast obtained that, which thou vauntedst, 
 this morning, thou didst pant for, with such great eager- 
 ness. Encompassed with all the circumstance of w^ar, 
 environed by my guards and officers, thou settest eyes on 
 that insulting springald, Richter Iwan.' 
 
 " All eyes were turned on the waivode, who, drawing 
 himself proudly up, looked on the Richter with features, 
 no longer evidencing any emotion, but cold and calm as 
 marble. 
 
 "■'Devils luck! thou, Iwan!' he gruffly muttered; 
 ' thou hast cast thy slough, though, young cockerel, since 
 we last met, — well, let me begone; thou wilt hardly de- 
 tain me.' 
 
 " ' Not I; albeit your oath may,' answered the vilez* 
 sternly; ' thou hast sworn, thou wouldst not leave my 
 tent, till one or other of us, in mortal conflict, bite the 
 dust. Thou shalt have thy heart's content — draw!' 
 
 << 'My ignorance was in fault — gramercy! I am not 
 bound to do battle with the man who saved my life,' re- 
 turned Peter, doggedly. 
 
 " *As you are a knight, I charge you observe your 
 knightly faith,' cried Iwan, with commanding energy; 
 ' I now defy thee, Peter! commonly called the Bloody, to 
 instant, and mortal debate, and proclaim thee apostate, re- 
 negade, and traitor. Deny my challenge, a Voutrance, and 
 on those bifronted terms, I'll stick what's baser, and harder 
 for man to bear, — perjury and cowardice! and in God's 
 light, will give thee out for a perjured coward. Here 
 stands my foot, — there lies my glove.' And with these 
 words, the Richter dashed down his iron gauntlet on the 
 pavement. 
 
 " ' And I take it up, my hero," cried Peter, the 
 terrors of the thunder-cloud charging his brow as he 
 spoke. ' Now, if I cleave thee down for this idle bravade,' 
 he continued, ' as, despite the service thou hast rendered 
 
 * Vilez, hero.

 me, I think, is not unlikely, your officers here will make 
 light scruple, in sending my ghost to hunt thine, in Mano's 
 shadowy realms.' 
 
 " * Not so, by Heaven! Prince,' exclaimed Iwan; 
 * my friends shall pawn their honours for just dealing. 
 Moreover, here are six of my bravest warriors, — give 
 them thy ring — bid them speed to thy camp, there to 
 abide thy safe return, and send hither some trusty gen- 
 tlemen, to give you the assurance of their being detained 
 in custody; if thou fallest not fairly by this hand, let 
 these, thy hostages, answer for it in any way, it may 
 please thee to give orders. And perhaps, Prince,' he 
 concluded, in a less stately tone; 'while this affair is 
 arranging, you will deign to join myself and comrades, 
 at our poor banquet.' 
 
 " To make short, after a gallant entertainment, the 
 champions darrained for the fight. Both were merely 
 mailed, en bianco, and armed only with tlieir swords. 
 The combat was not of long continuance; the experience, 
 and skill of thewaivode were, in vain, exerted against the 
 superior temperance, and quick motions of Iwan. In 
 vain, Peter would have availed himself of his giant 
 strength, to close upon his antagonist. In a very short 
 space of time, his ill-advised attempts cost him succes- 
 sively, three deep gashes, while the platform became a 
 puddle of blood; but insensible, both of pain and fatigue, 
 he continued to shower his weighty blows, as if urged by 
 some mighty engine. Iwan, at length, with wary energy, 
 received one of the passes of his adversary, on his arm, 
 and, almost in the same instant, plunged his sword through 
 the w^aivode's body, who fell prostrate, on the pavement, 
 without groan or struggle. — Such, Count Ragotzy," con- 
 cluded the keeper, '' was the issue of this encounter, and 
 such the merited fate of your friend — the far renowned, 
 Peter the Bloody." 
 
 Ragotzy had listened to the foregoing relation, 
 with his eyes fixed on the ground, in sullen silence, but

 the blue lines of his forehead were swoln, with the con- 
 tending emotions of his soul. — '* I ought to mention," 
 presently subjoined the keeper, " that, on the following 
 day, Peter's horsemen passed over to the ranks of the 
 Richter." 
 
 " What, all ?" demanded Ragotzy, in a tone of ex- 
 treme irritation. 
 
 " Every man of them, 1 trow," replied Swartz. 
 
 " My blood gets hot, at the mention of that Iwan," 
 said Ragotzy, adding, in somewhat of a hasty tone, and, 
 for the first time, raising his eye — "Whence has he 
 sprung? — what's his parentage?*' 
 
 " I cannot resolve you," said Swartz. " ' Boni viri et 
 buni vini, non est qucerenda origo ;' * but 'tis not many 
 years since the deceased Richter, whose power he wields, 
 encountered him, a boy-adventurer, wandering along the 
 sterile and rugged granze,t wdiich lies between Turkey 
 and that district, called of old, the Roman Dacia. He 
 introduced him to his camp, and in him built up an 
 edifice of honour, and renown. The lad won on the af- 
 fection of the Richter, but not more than he did, on the 
 Richter's w^arriors, over whom he gained a complete as- 
 cendancy ; so, after that chief's decease, Iwan was unani- 
 mously proclaimed his successor." 
 
 " I'll crop his honours, one of these days, or know the 
 reason." 
 
 " Would you take my advice, you will avoid meeting, 
 in bodily presence, lest, belike, you be sent to sleep with 
 as bloody a bed-fellow, as yourself; but, to return to 
 what we were before discussing — Will you join in league 
 with me?" 
 
 " In what deep ?" returned the count, after a long si- 
 lence ; " do you think to defy the cardinal's perquisi- 
 tions? since 'tis clear, if you connive, at the abduction of

 his ward, not only in the streets of the capitol, but where 
 there is air, more than to keep in life, in all this province, 
 he is sure to pounce upon you. The search will be close 
 and general." 
 
 *' I know not that," said Swartz : " yet, in such a case, 
 should I be taxing your lordship's hospitality too high, 
 were I to resort to a certain forest of Hungary, or seek 
 shelter, in one of those rifted lairs, where the Cyganian 
 wolves lap the blood of their victims, not many leagues 
 from Coloswar ?" 
 
 It is not easy to conceive the astonishment of Ragotzy, 
 at hearing this request. " By heavens !" he exclaimed, 
 *' You are the most extraordinary man, I ever encoun- 
 tered. What fiend hast thou in fee, to possess thee with 
 thine incredible information ? How came you acquainted 
 with my connexion, with the brigands of that forest ?" 
 
 The same distorted smile, or rather sneer, we have 
 noted before, lit up the man's countenance as, repressing 
 the comment that sprang to his lips, he simply made 
 answer, " I cry you mercy, my lord ; I named you not ;" 
 and then, after an instant, subjoined, — " am I to under- 
 stand, it is a treaty ?" 
 
 Ragotzy gave no reply, but mused in silence. Swartz 
 suffered a minute to elapse, and then resumed : " Gad's 
 mercy ! Count Ragotzy, how canst hesitate ? Perceive 
 you not, that you alone will reap all the advantages, ac- 
 cruing from this negociation ? Do I not off'er to aid 
 you with my sword, and counsel, in your present strait? 
 Are not my character and life, at your discretion ? 
 whilst your relative position will be, by my means, incal- 
 culably bettered ?" Still the mind of Ragotzy wavered, 
 and in a state of tumultuous uncertainty, he kept silence. 
 Again the voice of the keeper roused him from his 
 gloomy abstraction. " 1 grant," he said, directing a 
 somewhat bitter, and sneering glance at the Cygani, 
 which, probably meant more than met the eye — '* 1 grant, 
 it will rest with me, some future day, to hand you over to

 justice ; but, let me ask, were such my cue, might I not, 
 at this instant, alarm the castle, and have you appre- 
 hended ? — I demand of you, is it a treaty V 
 
 *' It is, "answered the count, after having deliberated long 
 in silence ; but he spoke, in that subdued voice and draw- 
 ling tone, which almost implied a negative : and having 
 thus signified his assent, he sunk into the stillness of 
 deep thought. In his secret heart. Count Ragotzy was 
 far from entertaining, with any satisfaction, the idea of 
 joining in this sort of hasty copartnership w^ith a man, 
 whose cognizance of certain mysterious events, seemed, at 
 least, as great as his own, and whose acquaintance with 
 circumstances, referring peculiarly to himself, bordered 
 on the miraculous. 
 
 It was some years before our history dates its com- 
 mencement, that the count remembered to have occasion- 
 ally beheld Swartz in Hermanstadt, anterior to the 
 period, wiien he became the keeper of that insane young 
 nobleman, to whom we have alluded. 
 
 The history of Count Rodna was melancholy. He 
 went by the title, originally belonging to an unknown 
 foreigner, in whose chateau, near the city of Coloswar, he 
 had passed the earliest years of his life, and who was 
 commonly reported, though probably on slight grounds, 
 to have been his grandfather. The murder of his vene- 
 rable benefactor, attended with circumstances of peculiar 
 mystery and horror, had deeply affected the mind of the 
 youthful Sigismund; so much so, that when (a few days 
 afterwards) Swartz arrived at the chateau, to conduct him 
 across the country to the Cardinal Martinuzzi, to whose 
 guardianship, it w^as said, the boy had been consigned, 
 he found his charge already in a state of mental stupor, 
 the sad repose of over-wrought nerves, and the incipient 
 stage of the fatal malady, which, from that day to the era 
 of our narrative, had not ceased to afflict the unhappy 
 eleve of Count Rodna.

 The arrival of Swartz, with his charge, at Rothen- 
 thorn,* (where, excepting during- some rare, and flying 
 visits to Hermanstadt, they had since resided,) happened 
 subsequently to Ragotzy's departure from the capital. 
 
 " Yet," said the Cygani, internally, " the rascal is quite 
 aware of my past pursuits, and half divines my present 
 purpose. Well, I must needs rely on his good offices to 
 a certain extent, though, as regards the bail he would fain 
 encumber me with, I'd just as lief stand excused. Our 
 people, indeed, arrogate the power of exorcising evil spirits 
 out of swine and cattle ; but as for casting out devils 
 from the human species, I ween, it passes their wits-craft." 
 Having dismissed the above train of thought, from his 
 mind, heturned to the keeper : " Swartz," he said abruptly, 
 and in the tone of haughtiness, which, from time to time, 
 he assumed, " How soon can I have an interview with 
 Hubert?" 
 
 " Do you, answered the keeper, give me the meeting, 
 in the adjoining vestibule, at midnight, and, ere then, I 
 doubt not to be able to compass the matter. — " Am I to 
 expect you ?" 
 
 Ragotzy was about to answer, when his attention was 
 attracted, by the gradual elevation of a broad shadow of 
 a human figure, upon the castle wall. The two started. 
 The cowled head of Father Dominick, and afterwards 
 his whole body, emerged into the upper air, within three 
 yards of where they stood, by means of a narrow flight of 
 stone steps, which formed a medium of communication, 
 between that end of the gallery, and the court-yard of 
 the castle. The ominous form had no sooner been de- 
 scried, than it melted away from view, silently, and 
 almost imperceptibly, as some vaporous exhalation of the 
 earth, driven before the light morning wind, will dissolve

 into air, as it rolls along. Rapidly, indeed, and like a 
 shade, did the ghostly father glide by, on his way ; but in 
 passing, from the gallery into the semicircular vestibule 
 before mentioned, he paused, stooped, seemed to raise 
 something from the ground, and then was lost to sight, 
 ere either Swartz or the Brigand recovered from their 
 amazement. Then, first, Ragotzy made a movement, as 
 if to rush after him ; but the keeper plucked his sleeve, to 
 hold him back. " Benot rash," he cried, " or we are ruined. 
 Fortunately he did not, I think, observe us. Why should 
 you entail on yourself a similar fate to that of Hubert ? 
 Your interests are mine : be guided in this by me, and I 
 will point you out a path to vengeance, such as — but — 
 this way — we meet at midnight." 
 
 Ragotzy, after muttering some incoherent words, suf- 
 fered himself to be led away, and he, and Swartz passed 
 down the same stone staircase, which the fearful con- 
 fessor had just ascended.

 The guests had departed — the glittering throng of 
 warriors and nobles, singly,'or in twos and threes, had 
 slowly left the presence — the last lingering envoy had 
 adjusted, to his satisfaction, the difficulty, which had 
 detained him, and had made his last act of reverence; 
 and an unwonted silence, only the more impressive, on 
 account of the previous hum, and busy evidence of life, 
 reigned throughout the citadel. It settled on the mag- 
 nificent apartment, where had been held the levee of the 
 lord regent, who, alone, of all the splendid group, which 
 so lately filled that lofty architectural hall to overflow- 
 ing, lingered on the spot, like its incorporated spirit. 
 This hall had lately been elaborately decorated, and was 
 truly grand in scale, and rich in adornment. The walls 
 were of oak, and pannelled with mouldings, correspond- 
 ing in design, with the splendid oriel window of shafted 
 stone work, " dyed with the soft chequering of a sleepy 
 light," and filled with painted glass, where the sun-beams 
 glimmered dimly, through scenes, representing, and illus- 
 trating the miracles of our Redeemer. The ribbed arches 
 of the lofty roof were richly wrought, and crossed each 
 other in numerous compartments. The effect of the 
 whole, emblazoned, as it was, with armorial achievements 
 and insignia, viewed, in its " awful perspective," from 
 either extremity, was inconceivably grand, and imposing. 
 On the west side of the hall, a private door opened upon 
 a spiral staircase, that gave access to the lord cardinal's 
 suite of apartments.

 had signified the friendly disposition of his respective 
 sovereign. The stoled ecclesiastic — the gallant ve- 
 teran, '' bearded like a pard," whose very name sounded 
 like an alarum, — and the stripling chief, emulous of 
 the other's honourable career — the well-caparisoned 
 knight, " whose only talisman was his sword," — and 
 the proud graf, who could number a long, and unbro- 
 ken line of noble ancestry, whose chivalrous deeds might 
 have illustrated, for centuries, the history of Hungary — 
 one and all, on that day, had done homage to the 
 genius, if not to the rank, of Martinuzzi ; and not a few 
 had intimated, in terms, which could not admit of mis- 
 construction, that, in the present juncture of affairs, there 
 was only one arm in Hungary, potent to wield her scep- 
 tre — only one man, upon whose head, her sacred crown 
 ought to descend. But these flattering testimonies 
 sounded, on Martinuzzi's ear, like something false and 
 hollow; and when he looked around him, in hopes of des- 
 crying some nobleman, or chieftain of native growth, 
 whose order constituted the real strength, and pride of 
 Hungary, it wasonly rarely, and ''far between, '*thathiseye 
 lit on such. Unfortunately, from natural affection towards 
 those, who, without reserve, applauded his elevation, the 
 regent, after his memorable overthrow of his foreign and 
 domestic enemies, had suspended many of the magnats 
 from military offices, which they had previously filled, 
 with the approval of their countrymen, and (with the 
 single exception of Valentine Count Turascus) had sub- 
 stituted, in the principal commands, men, who, whatever 
 might be their deserts, were strangers in the land, and 
 whose names or titles sounded dissonantly to the ears of 
 an Hungarian. This was a step, which, by depositing the 
 seeds of party and faction, in the prejudices and strong 
 corporate spirit of the native aristocracy, proved the 
 source of much future calamity. For years after the 
 adoption of an expedient, which accused, in some mea- 
 sure, the prescient eye of Martinuzzi, that prelate bitterly

 repented its impolicy. He had, thereby, certainly ren- 
 dered the external surface of his administration more fair 
 and entire ; but, in spite of its commanding posture, and 
 aspect of authority, its moral foundations were silently 
 crumbling from beneath it. The final issue shall pre- 
 sently be unfolded. It may,'however, be just necessary 
 to observe, that on that day, Martinuzzi found cause to 
 regret, more deeply than he had ever before done, having 
 embraced so unfortunate a measure. He had indulged 
 very sanguine hopes, that all parties, at whatsoever sa- 
 crifice of individual interest, would have been glad to 
 unite, in a common scheme of defence, against a common 
 enemy, and, oblivious of past causes for alienation, and 
 distrust, without hesitation, would have ranged them- 
 selves, in so critical a state of affairs, under his standard. 
 But the prejudices and hostilities of an aristocracy, pos- 
 sessing such mighty, and independent authority, could 
 not be quietly inurned, at a moment's warning, however 
 pressing, and arduous the conjuncture ; and so it was, 
 that even their sense of the enormities, which would other- 
 wise be enacted, — the dread apprehension of the utter 
 ruin, and subversion of their country (whose extent might 
 be virtually measured, by the walls of the metropolis), 
 did not reconcile the exiled patriots, assembled in Her- 
 manstadt, to Martinuzzi's rule, although, had the nation 
 been united and resolved, that authority and genius, 
 which had hitherto surmounted all difficulties, were ad- 
 mitted to be equal to the exigency of affairs. 
 
 That very day, the regent, in hopes of conciliating his 
 enemies, had lent a willing ear to the proud solicitations 
 of Queen Isabella, that he would appoint one of her 
 creatures, (by name, Mirce), to a post of considerable 
 trust, in the city of Coloswar, vacant, by the mysterious 
 evanishment of Count Oldimar, one of the castellans of 
 that fortress. But the magnats of Erdely were not so to 
 be reconciled, at the eleventh hour; their standing feud, 
 or hereditary patriotism, might not be intermitted; and

 notwithstanding the regent's unrivalled talents for govern- 
 ment, although placed at the head of a vsrell-organized, 
 and adventurous body of men, who, he knew, would prove 
 their fidelity to the last, he felt, as though the hasty 
 structure of his power tottered to its foundation, from 
 the disheartening conviction, that it rested not on its 
 broad, and proper basis. 
 
 On that day, Martinuzzi had summoned to his aid, all 
 his occult power of stealing on the affections, and whilst 
 the enthusiasm of his eloquence elicited the sympathy of 
 his auditors, and inspired the passions, which, he felt, he had 
 stamped upon their memory, a never-dying impression of 
 his incomparable abilities. He had confirmed his friends 
 in their confidence. The timid were heartened : the 
 neutral, and wavering secured: those who were too eager 
 for his usurpation, or who might have expressed themselves 
 too incautiously to that effect, were gently reined back, 
 without finding their affections alienated, or their hopes 
 diminished. He knew how to distinguish between men, 
 who adhered to his cause, from attachment to his person, 
 or who stood by him, as being the constitutional rallying 
 point of the lords of Hungary, and those adventurers, 
 who bore arms, under the shadow of his standard, merely 
 in consideration of the distinction, or greater licence and 
 plunder, which so desperate a service seemed to hold out. 
 To the first class his manner was, beyond expression, 
 bUnd, and courteous. To the patriot, his language 
 teemed with enthusiasm, and inspiration, being notwith- 
 standing, firm, dignified, and uncompromising. In a 
 strain of eloquence, that carried away all hearts, and 
 which bound down the unwilling mind to conviction, he 
 inveighed against the past, and present insidious policy of 
 Austria; and insinuated his doubts, that neither the 
 mountains, nor reciprocal terror, would much longer 
 prove a barrier from her aggression.*

 Then, on the other hand, pointing to the creed of the 
 Prophet, as involving the principle of universal dominion, 
 he declared, that the Moslem crescent, was the land-mark 
 of Africa, and that it darkly delineated the geography of 
 those regions, which lay between the river of Egypt, and 
 the Atlantic, and the great desert. He exclaimed, in the 
 words of Daniel — " The abomination of desolation is in 
 the holy place ;" and after showing, that the same ensign 
 cast the shadow of its despotism over Asia, since the 
 civil, and religious sceptre of the oriental world, was held 
 by the great Turk, his mind misgave him, he said, when 
 he reflected on that renown, which, converging its rays 
 from the east and from the south, streamed, like a comet, 
 over astonished Europe. He exposed the rapid, and ex- 
 tensive conquests of Solyman, that vigilant and sagacious 
 sultan, whose eye, from the palace of his seraglio, per- 
 vaded the vast extent of his dominions, in three quarters 
 of the globe. He demonstrated, from the position of the 
 sinking state, whose narrow bounds were encircled and 
 pressed by a hostile line on every side, that, unless their 
 measures were concerted with prudence, and prosecuted 
 with no less promptitude; the province of Transylvania 
 must speedily be swallowed up, in the collision of the rival, 
 and conflicting empires; and finally, he called upon 
 all true Hungarians to rally round the beautiful ori- 
 flamme, upheld by a nation's rights, her liberties, and 
 her faith. 
 
 He deprecated the idea, of his ever having been go- 
 verned, by any other motives, than those of honour, pa- 
 triotism, and the exaltation of the church; and, alluding 
 to the reports, so industriously circulated, of his design to 
 make himself king, he complained of them, as a cruel, 
 and unfounded calumny, incompatible with his principles, 
 and utterly at variance, with the whole tenor of his life. 
 
 " Verily, gentlemen," said Martinuzzi, in conclusion; 
 '* the crown, I covet, is a heavenly crown; and, after a 
 sufficient experience of the unsatisfactory nature of what

 the world calls glory, casting my view towards a brighter 
 prospect, I sigh for the repose of a cloister." To such as, 
 he guessed, had joined his service, in order to advance 
 their own selfish, and separate ends, how little soever 
 solicitous about his failure, or success, he had already 
 been liberal in his appointments; and if he dilapidated, 
 by his donatives, the treasure, or rather the indigence, of 
 the state, and exhausted those revenues, already too 
 much impoverished, he might be allowed to be still more 
 profuse, in his praises, and promises, and to lavish " with- 
 out circumspection or restraint," all sorts of encourage- 
 ments over the future. An address to this purport, which 
 derived, perhaps, its chief effect, from that irresistible 
 fervour, so natural to the mind of Martinuzzi, made the 
 desired impression on his audience. There was hardly 
 an individual, who came into the lord regent's presence, 
 on the day we commemorate, but, who left him, knit to 
 his cause, and devoted to his interests, by one of the 
 strongest of all ties, that of affection and respect, based 
 on their common hopes, and common policy.* 
 
 The position, which Martinuzzi occupied, at that moment, 
 in the eye of Europe, was most interesting, and strikes us, 
 when we look back on it, with an air of magnificence. If 
 high renown, the universal admiration of his contempora- 
 ries, exalted rank, and well-earned opulence, — if a king- 
 dom at his disposal, backed by the Pope's Bull, as one 
 recompense of a life of abstinence and virtue, — if the re- 
 spect of every crowned head in Europe for a character, 
 whose dangerous importance, the voice of envy could do 
 no more than magnify, — if his own consciousness of sur- 
 passing inward endowments, which, by a happy, but rare 
 conjunction, combined the most profound acquirement, 
 and commanding reach of mind, with an unwearied, pa- 
 tient, and eagle-eyed energy of thought, — if genius, at 
 once brilliant and correct, seeming almost an emanation

 from the superior intellect, — if this felicitous combina- 
 tion of rare endowment, did not ensure as much happi- 
 ness, as was proper to a devout and holy man, his at- 
 tached followers and friends greatly deceived themselves. 
 They argued that,

 His serenity and spiritual peace were, on the occasion we 
 refer to, reflected on the regent's countenance. Every 
 syllable of his towering oratory, bespoke a mind at ease ; 
 and whilst all the sensibilities of his noble nature were 
 awakened, as he depicted the wretched condition of his 
 country, with breakers a-head, and drifted from her 
 anchors; all could discern, or fancied they saw, the 
 honest pride of virtue strengthen him, in the reflection, 
 that his was the voice to calm the moral tempest, and that 
 it was his province, to guide the helm, through so intricate 
 a navigation, as lay before the vessel of the state.

 And now, Martinuzzi remained alone in that regal hall, 
 so lately crowded with the gaiety and gallantry of youth, 
 and the wisdom, or piety of maturer years. He was left 
 alone, — alone, with his glory and gladness ! Ah ! well 
 might the preacher question, whether the eminent of their 
 age, whom the shallow world is wont to deem the 
 favourites of fortune, view, in their secret soul, the dis- 
 tinction, in the light of a happiness. t Martinuzzi was

 seated at the council table, busily engaged, with certain 
 state-papers, arranged before him. Some he turned over, 
 with a hasty glance, and on others, he appeared to dwell, 
 as if their contents liad been of greater moment. 
 
 From the paths of blood, — and such, for the most part, 
 is the history of the turbulent era of our narrative, — it is 
 grateful to turn aside, in order to contemplate the display 
 of genius and of virtue. — Ttis pleasing to repose, if only for 
 a moment, on so magnanimous and beautiful a character, 
 as that of Martinuzzi ; and in this view, we are here 
 tempted to make our readers more intimately acquainted 
 with him. Nature had enriched the person of Martinuzzi 
 with the choicest endowments. He was, as historians in- 
 form us, one of the handsomest men of his time. His 
 stature, although above the middle height, never struck 
 the beholder as being tall. His deportment was eminently 
 graceful ; he was uncommonly well built, and capable of 
 enduring considerable fatigue. His face was a perfect 
 oval ; his eyes, a deep and melancholy blue, replete with the 
 most touching sensibility, were strongly indicative of the 
 prevailing thoughtfulness of his nature, although, when 
 his soul spake through those eyes, with all the energy of 
 genius, or when they lit up, in sympathy with his native 
 eloquence, nothing could exceed the piercing brilliancy 
 of their expression, alike calculated to lighten the heart 
 of suffering innocence, and to appal the guilty, or abash 
 the oppressor — " Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos." 
 In his Roman nose, and slightly distended nostrils, the 
 determination, and force of his nature sat conspicuous. 
 The lordly expanse of his beautiful, and pellucid brow 
 denoted the mens divinior, which it curtained. Tlie ad- 
 mirable curve of his lips, the very seat of charity, and the 
 rounded dimpled chin (whose contour, when lovely, is so 
 characteristic of an amiable disposition,) bespoke, in 
 George Martinuzzi, the singular gentleness and benignity 
 of his nature. One remarkable feature, however, we must 
 not forget, if we would complete the vraisemb lance of our

 portrait. The right ear of Martinuzzi, ever since he 
 arrived at the age of manhood, was distinguished by a 
 tuft of dark hair.* He appeared, at this period, to have 
 scarcely seen half a century ; but it is probable, that the 
 onerous cares and anxieties of state had somewhat antici- 
 pated the furrowing touch of time. 
 
 On the occasion, when we first introduced him to our 
 readers, the cardinal was arrayed in the sumptuous, and 
 splendid vestments, befitting a high dignitary of the 
 Catholic church, t and the efi'ect, which they produced, 
 was as imposing, as could well be conceived. He wore 
 a pelisse of massive gold tissue, thrown over a sort of 
 tunic of embroidered velvet, likewise superbly tissued, 
 and of the colour of violet, edged round with the richest 
 point lace. A golden mitre, upon a white ground, rested 
 on his head ; his shoes were of crimson satin, and a dia- 
 mond of highest price, in the form of a buckle, sparkled 
 from either foot. The throne, or chair of state, on which 
 he reclined, having embroidered cushions of crimson 
 velvet, was surmounted by a canopy of solid gold. 
 
 What thoughts Martinuzzi had under this gorgeous 
 attire, it were perhaps fearful to unfold ; nevertheless, with 
 the reader's indulgence, we shall attempt it. After occu- 
 pying himself, for a brief space, in arranging certain state- 
 papers, and noting down occasionally any idea, which 
 suggested itself, in regard to their contents, Martinuzzi, 
 at length, abruptly laid the pen aside, and, after a pause, 
 gave voice, in a low and subdued tone, to a train of ideas, 
 in which hitherto he had silently indulged. His broken, 
 and interrupted speech indicated the throes of feeling, 
 struggling for deliverance, — the spontaneous unburthen- 
 ing of a soul, wound up to its highest tension, — of a heart, 
 almost bursting with emotions, that for long, " like the

 " Well !" — in such broken array was his reverie mar- 
 shalled — ''well, the day breathed at last. The shadows 
 fled away ; the blue and vigorous air did shake its wings ; 
 the blithe, immortal day, grew young again ; the bat re- 
 tired to his chamber of delicious darkness, to rest from 
 his vigils of the night; the church-yard graves yawned, 
 and received back their restless tenantry ; the contem- 
 plative owl forsook his tower, and reposes in security, 
 till the darkness again call him to his stated occupation ; — 
 all — all, whose affairs, like mine, and nameless work, 
 walk by midnight, — all but me! I — I alone, of all the 
 solitary things, that hate the insulting light, know not 
 whereinto I may rush, that, with the mantle of a capa- 
 cious mist, I might envelope me. I cannot, when the 
 sickly stars are out, flee, like the rest, to loathsome char- 
 nels; I cannot, when the tedious, toilsome night is over, 
 wrap me up awhile, and, in concealment, slumber away 
 from day, or sit upon the earth, with open eyes, counting 
 the lazy minutes until eve, companioned by majestic 
 silence; I miust not fly my soul, nor my soul me; no 
 unthought-of chamber, cut out of marble — no silent 
 tabernacle, proffers its sanctuary to m.e — no church-yard 
 asyla will hallow my consciousness. For me, there is no 
 shadow, in the day-shine, from the heat, no covert from 
 the storm, no place of refuge from the tyranny of eyes, 
 that repress, and hedge me round. — Hush !" 
 
 Here, recalled, by the very excess of his feelings, the 
 regent glanced jealously, and hurriedly around him. 
 
 '' No !" he muttered, in answer to his own thoughts, 
 and then again peered into the perilous depths of his

 soul, taking up the thread of his reflections, where he 
 had dropped it. *' 1 must go forth," he proceeded, 
 in an indistinct murmur, " amid the garish haunts of 
 this familiar life — go forth erect, as if, under my 
 distracting purple, no livid spot deformed me. Oh ! 
 I must smooth, and torture my countenance, with de- 
 ceiving smiles, regulate my pulse-throb, modulate my 
 very tones — ay, tutor my tongue in the insolence of 
 words, ere I let the traitors escape my lips. God ! 
 my brain may burn, my heart may battle and break, 
 no one heeds ; for neither thought, nor feeling must 
 find repose in me. Oh ! thou bright fruit, gilded 
 by young ambition, to be plucked from the aspiring 
 branch, I have clutched thee, indeed ; but, ah ! the leap 
 hath hurt my precious soul. Like to the apples of As- 
 phaltes,* thou wert most fair to the eye, but bitterness, 
 and ashes to the taste." 
 
 Martinuzzi ceased ; and, flinging himself into his seat, 
 seemed overpowered, by inward emotion. Then, after 
 awhile, he lifted up his head, and continued to soliloquize 
 aloud. 
 
 '^ I remember me, when I was a boy, I could dream, 
 through the weariless summer-day, in high and holy 
 abstractions, with love of kind, and country. To my 
 thought, the solid globe grew animate, and vocal : beau- 
 tiful the misty twilight then, sank on the wind-swept 
 shore. Oh ! with what syllables of tender and eternal 
 mystery, did the softest notes of falling waters harmonize 
 silence to my heart. Ah ! in the minstrelsy of hope, all 
 sounds and sights of life's diurnal round enkindled omens, 
 and mystic meanings of the future — bright personifica- 
 tions, as in an elder day. Night, sublime, walked the 
 pale rocks ; and the blessed sunshine, that rode upon the 
 summer mist, was mildest. Banquet of peace, unbought !

 and the transparent goblet ! Yellow-haired Morning, and 
 the weeping wild rose, how ye did charm me! And 
 how from pride, and pomp, and mere human grandeur, 
 my fancy framed an idol ! But what have these enamoured 
 oracles of youth — what have they all come to ? Why did 
 I grow out of them ? Would that I could have remained 
 for aye, by Alicia's side, straying, with book in hand, 
 amid the groves,* a guiltless, dreamy, unsophisticated 
 boy, instead of — oh God ! now — poor, most poor, with 
 abundance !"t and Martinuzzi clinched his two hands, 
 with fearful agony. " Now, — fame, and dignity, and 
 sceptred power, are like the furies ; and all freshness of 
 the heart, the mildest moisture of the dew of life, makes 
 their dire aliment, | The air, I breathe, comes coffined 
 up in sepulchres; the quilts, I lie on, are too sumptuous, 
 too filled with gossamer, to yield their spell ; the viands 
 all are delicate, too much for food, and in digestion turn 
 to aconite ; the flowing chalice mantles to the brim, with 
 'gall of asps;'^ all language is a lie; the thoughts, 
 which I endure are damnable ; where'er 1 set my foot is 
 strewed with aspicks ; the life, 1 hold is death's eternal 
 torture. Oh, God ! in what, after all, is my glory? Can 
 this be glory ? Oh ! if this be being, better, a thousand 
 times better, were extinction. No, no — Tush ! I forget, 
 I have one secret consciousness sweetening this hell upon 
 earth ; and for the rest, great God ! I am myself the 
 error. Fiat voluntas tua /" 
 
 Here Martinuzzi slid down from the throne, and, clasp- 
 ing his hands tightly, knelt on the golden footstool, fas- 
 tened to the seat ; his lips, for awhile, faintly stirring 
 with internal prayer, seemed like the leaves of autumn 
 shivering in the night-wind, when, wrapping his face in 
 his gorgeous mantle, his devotions came to a pause, or,

 if he still held communion with Heaven, he thought his 
 orisons, and became, to all appearance, calm as silent. 
 From this posture of musing quietude, he was presently 
 roused, by a footstep striding along the hall, and the 
 shadow of a man fell on the wainscot, beyond the regal 
 chair. He looked up, and having recognized the in- 
 truder, exclaimed, in a deep, low, ghostly voice, '* 'Tis 
 even he! oh, God ! who shall gainsay thy judgments? 
 It is most meet, that I feel thy penance for the sin of my 
 parent, and that his presence bring a tribe of fiends to 
 minister to thy wrath. Yet, lie still awhile, oh my torn 
 heart ! I am nothing else but regent." 
 
 In saying these words, Martinuzzi arose, and, while 
 deep, calm thought alone was pourtrayed upon his pas- 
 sionless countenance, advanced to meet the intruder, 
 who pursued his impetuous course, to and fro, without 
 heeding the regent's approach. The individual, we men- 
 tion, was clad in weeds of mourning. One would not 
 predicate, from his juvenile aspect, that he had reached 
 his majority ; probably he had not. His stature ex- 
 ceeded the middle height of man ; his features, though 
 wild, were strikingly handsome; and his long sable locks 
 flowed negligently over his shoulders. Martinuzzi came 
 up to him, and, grasping his hands within his own, whilst 
 his eyes grew vivid with sensibility, he said, '' Sigis- 
 mund ! my son !" The other gazed vacantly, but made 
 no answer. 
 
 Martinuzzi continued, — ''You leave Rothenthorn so 
 rarely, that when you do visit Hermanstadt, you are to 
 blame to keep yourself so close. The grandson of Count 
 Rodna should not so slight his guardian." 
 
 " Prithee, your eminence," returned Sigismund, "who 
 is Count Rodna's son ? Is he one of the eternal lazar 
 house of Italy or France, they tell me, you saddle, on 
 the broad shoulders of fair Erdely ? Make us acquainted, 
 I beg of you, that is, an you promise me his countship 
 will bear with my humours ? for I have no notion of your

 mettlesome grafs, who spar for every trifle. The eyes of 
 the LadyCzerina, or your highness's buckles, will set the 
 magnates of your court cock-a-hoop in an instant, and 
 'tis heigh-ho for a tilting bout, though, for aught they 
 can know, or your eminence will swear to, the brilliancy 
 of one or other may be but counterfeit. I hope I speak 
 no treason." 
 
 A slight shade passed across the fine countenance of 
 Martinuzzi. There was a pause. 
 
 " Did you walk hither, with the intention of seeking 
 me ?" inquired the regent, coldly. 
 
 " Perhaps I may have," answered the youth, in a tone 
 of indifference. " We ever like to look on the outward 
 prototype of our frequent, and internal meditations. To 
 stand in the shoes of the late king, which in others had 
 been dangerous, in your eminence looks honour. What, 
 in a madman, (myself, for instance,) had been usurpa- 
 tion, in Martinuzzi were only lawful rule ; and though it 
 be high treason for a subject to compass St. Stephen's 
 crown, in Martinuzzi it will be patriotism, for so the car- 
 dinal most solemnly gives it out, and he is esteemed as 
 holy, and as reverend a man as any in the land. We see, 
 you are reverend: you have the phylacteries of your profes- 
 sion inscribed, in glittering characters, on your front. The 
 blind might spy you out, at a distance, as they would a 
 civet cat. Your vestments might put Soliman to flight, as 
 erst the pomp of St. Leon did the Goth.* I'd credit your 
 eminence for a tun of reverence, but in respect to your 
 holiness, or belike I rate you too highly, 'tis comparable 
 to my poor wits, I trow, — a grain, and to spare." 
 
 Martinuzzi hid his face in the palm of his hands, and 
 moaned audibly. The lips of Sigismund were curled, 
 even to scorn, as with bitterness he proceeded — 
 
 " Dost practise howling, your highness ? Nay, then,

 ance of the pontifical train.

 thou'lt top thy part one day, and they'd best grow cotton 
 betimes in Tophet, if they'd spare their teeth. Resolve 
 me, most sapient Pharisee — think'st thou, the soul, if 
 melted at last to penitence, could gush out tears enough 
 to make a flood so mighty, as, in the course of time, 
 might wipe away the stains of regicide?" 
 
 Martinuzzi looked up, and with an air of mild, and sad 
 composure, answered — " I hope so, Sigismund. I be- 
 lieve so, with God — " 
 
 ''Ay, ay ; but not with man, sir," rejoined the youth, 
 with stern significance. '' Not all the tears contrition 
 ever shed, can wash out treason : — with God, you say ? 
 Well, with God — I hope so too." 
 
 Another pause ensued, which was broken by Marti- 
 nuzzi again demanding the cause of his being favoured 
 with his companion's visit ? 
 
 " It was here, but now, my lord," replied Sigismund, 
 putting his finger to his forehead, "and, hey! presto, 
 'tis gone ! Your eminence is such good company, and 
 so facetious, withal, you would corrupt the memory of a 
 saint, and, i'troth, mine is none of the readiest. When 
 I find myself in the presence of your mightiness, for the 
 life of me, my head can only compass the single idea of 
 your eminence's transcendant qualities. But I cry you 
 pardon : — was not St. Peter, in his day, bishop of Rome, 
 your highness ? " 
 
 " Even so," said Martinuzzi. 
 
 '' I have been thinking," rejoined Sigismund, " that 
 his holiness must have thought his translation to the ja- 
 nitorship of heaven, a happy preferment; and, egad, if 
 being head-jailor, in these dominions, would qualify you, 
 for an assistant of his saintship, your eminence, after all, 
 need not despair of the appointment, when he wearies of 
 his office. By the way, I would have an order to tra- 
 verse your Tartarus, beneath the citadel, most reverend

 who are now in the dungeons, are mostly confined there, 
 for treasonable practises." 
 
 " Perhaps so," rejoined the youth; '^ yet when Heaven 
 has cast up his account, some of them, I surmise, will 
 be called to an easy reckoning." 
 
 " In what respect can they, or their habitation con- 
 cern you ? " inquired Martinuzzi. 
 
 "Why-, in sooth, not greatly," replied the youth: 
 '' shall I say my body's lead, and I've too much phlegm ; 
 or, that the antics of human nature are so wild, and va- 
 rious, — so modified by circumstance, — that I should like 
 to join in a game of bo-peep below ; nay, I recommend 
 to your eminence, the experiment. You've no notion 
 what a spell 'twould cast, o'er your downy couch, were you 
 to look on the flinty pillow of the wretched : — perhaps, 
 one day, or I stumble in judgment, you'll learn the 
 secret. From the captive, triumphing in his fetters, to 
 the tyrant, festering on his stool, there's more stern 
 stuff, in the core of human hearts, than your wise men 
 dream of. Your fool has known as much as this, many 
 a day, and oft ; but who would heed a fool's philosophy, 
 to rail is his vocation, and there's an end on't. Lend me 
 your hand, my lord." 
 
 Martinuzzi held forth his right hand, to the lunatic 
 young nobleman, who, taking it within his own, and 
 carefully examining its lineaments, went on, in the same 
 incoherent strain, as before. 
 
 "A fair hand this, — a fair, and honourable hand, the 
 parasites of a court would tell ye ; but, Luke Swartz 
 reckoned palmistry too deep a study, for one o'my wits, 
 so I never was taught it — 'twere like casting pearls before 
 swine, as the learned express it, which, methinks, were a 
 thankless office. Nathless 'tis a good hand, and this gem 
 sets it off hugely. Is it of price ? — but that I need not 
 ask, — I thank you, sir." 
 
 In saying these last words, the young count removed 
 a ring, from off one of the fingers of the cardinal, and

 put it on his own. It was a plain gold one, bearing the 
 regent's cipher. 
 
 "What mean you, Sigismund ? return me my ring; 
 you trouble me, my son," said Martinuzzi, with some 
 warmth . 
 
 " Gramercy, then, but I am ^rown powerful, my lord, 
 to trouble him that troubles a whole kingdom. For your 
 ring, to-morrow, I will restore it, to-morrow, your emi- 
 nence. There's magic in't, in the interim, and 'twill serve 
 as well as the voice of Hungary's regent, whom I were a 
 traitor, to take from the business of the state, even for 
 the passing of an hour." Thus saying, Sigismund sprung 
 off to the further end of the room. 
 
 At that moment, the seneschal entered, and, after ad- 
 dressing a few words to Martinuzzi, withdrew ; and pre- 
 sently, a young female was ushered into the hall, who, 
 with a modest, but perfectly self-possessed air, advanced 
 towards the regent ; and, with tears starting into her 
 eyes, gracefully cast herself at his feet: — "Mercy! 
 mercy ! " she exclaimed. 
 
 " What is your suit?" inquired Martinuzzi, with some 
 slight perturbation of manner, and a scarcely perceptible 
 tremor, in the tones of his voice : " Mercy, unto whom? 
 what would you, maiden ? " 
 
 " Share my father's dungeon, and his danger," an- 
 swered the female; and resisting all the attempts of Mar- 
 tinuzzi to raise her up, she hurriedly continued : " Last 
 night, my father was apprehended, by your orders." 
 
 " On what charo;e ? " asked Martinuzzi, in his wonted 
 mild tones. 
 
 " I cannot say," answered Veronica, for the damsel was 
 no other ; " it is no concern of mine, since, were he the 
 worst of criminals, I am his daughter, your eminence :" 
 and then Veronica, in anxiety to obtain her suit, poured 
 forth all the eloquence of her nature, without reserve, and 
 the orenius of filial love, which was her soul's essence, 
 lent power and energy, to every plea she urged.

 At last, not perceiving any signs of relenting, in the 
 manner of Martinuzzi, she paused, for a sudden fear 
 thrilled her bosom. "You cannot mean, that he should 
 die ? " she exclaimed, and her quivering lip betokened 
 the agony, struggling in her heart : ^' Or, is he dead ? 
 Yes, you have murdered him ! " 
 
 " Prithee rise, my child," said Martinuzzi, in the gen- 
 tlest accents, that ever issued from the lips of authority, 
 *' your father lives; his cause of imprisonment shall be 
 looked to : arise ! " 
 
 *' No, I will beg, till my knees take root i'the earth," 
 returned the maiden, while, lifting her clasped hands, 
 with a look of supplication, she retained a position, as 
 graceful as ever, the genius of sculpture wrought from 
 Parian marble. There was, indeed, something in her 
 sweet countenance, upraised, and every feature working 
 with her impassioned, and fervid pleading, that, (" not to 
 speak it profanely") might have reminded a spectator 
 of the celebrated head of the Minerva.* " My lord, my 
 lord," she continued, whilst her sweet speech flowed from 
 her ruddy lips, in streams of liquid melody : " Oh ! let 
 the vaulted pavement, which encloses my father's crime 
 and wretchedness, lift up, that I may partake the living 
 burial of his solitude." 
 
 Martinuzzi meditated for a moment, ere he made an- 
 swer, '* Daughter, you have your request." 
 
 If Veronica was silent, her eyes, glistening with those 
 tears, with which the overflowing of her heart supplied 
 them, gave token of greater thanks, than the utmost 
 eloquence of language could express. 
 
 " I apprehend, however," continued the cardinal, *' ac- 
 cording to the prison regulations, that you cannot remain 
 after the vesper-bell toll; but rise, virtuous maiden," he 
 added, at tlie same time taking her hand in his, to assist 
 her, from her supplicating posture: "I owe it to your

 merit to declare, that, by means, you wot not of, you 
 have secured a friend, to your father's house, at his ut- 
 termost need. I am interested in thy fate, my child, 
 more so, than I shall tell you, at present. Would that 
 thy sire's vacillating, and unstable nature, owned some- 
 what of thy metal ! " Then, meeting Veronica's look of 
 surprise, with an almost parental smile, he proceeded in 
 a low voice : ^'Ah ! there must be more matter in thy 
 recreant creed, than I dreamt of, heretofore. By the 
 lady ! 'tis a rare heresy ; but I'll have thee back, never- 
 theless, to the veritable fold." 
 
 The astonishment of Veronica, at these words, was 
 strongly depicted in her countenance. How had the lord 
 regent penetrated the nature of her religious opinions? 
 — a secret she believed to be confined to herself and 
 parent. Her soft eyes, ever vocal with intelligence, 
 sought an explanation, and Martinuzzi, presently again 
 spoke: — 
 
 *' 'Twas your mother's error, child; but, with the bless- 
 ing of Heaven, the defection shall stop here." — Veronica's 
 amazement increased, and her heart palpitated, with ap- 
 prehension, but she would not trust herself to speak: — 
 *' In all else," continued the regent, your mother was an 
 excellent lady," — Veronica started — " only herein, her 
 knowledge wrought to her destruction, and the very in- 
 quisitiveness of human reason proved the snare of her 
 soul: but, I will extricate thee, thou blessed shoot of a 
 frail stem, from the toils, which entangled the daughter 
 of Baron Walstein." 
 
 "Mysterious Heaven!" exclaimed Veronica; "how 
 have you discovered the relationship, which subsisted 
 betwixt me and her, who is a soul in bliss?" 
 
 " She was the cousin, and sworn friend, of the Princess 
 Beatrice," answered Martinuzzi. " Alas ! I knew her 
 well." 
 
 " Oh God ! then you knew, you k?iow my father," 
 cried Veronica, with a scream of awakened terror, as she

 sunk down, again, on the pavement; and, uplifted her 
 clasped hands, as if in deprecation of the regent's wrath. 
 
 " Damsel," he replied; '^ were certain parties, in Her- 
 manstadt, aware of my having the outlaw in fetters, his 
 life were not worth so much, as a beggar's ransom ; but 
 cheer thee, my child," — and Martinuzzi again upraised 
 the bewildered girl — " cheer thee, I say: whatever be 
 thy father's subsequent crimes, let him answer for them, 
 at the bar of Heaven. As respects his outlawry, I have 
 cognition, that he was unjustly dealt by. I know him, 
 for certain, to be as innocent, as was her royal brother, 
 of the abduction, and death of the Princess Beatrice." 
 
 "Whatdo I hear?" exclaimed Veronica, "Transporting 
 assurance! My father stands acquitted, by the suffrage 
 of Hungary's regent, — my lord, he told you. Ha! you 
 then, — yes, you must have spoken with Him. If I had 
 but breath, I'd ask, was'tthe Graf, Peter Pereny, told 
 you?" 
 
 " That's to be put to question, with a witness!" said a 
 voice from behind, with startling abruptness. The maiden 
 turned her eyes, and Sigismund was seen emerging, from 
 the embrasure of a window, whither he had retired. 
 
 " An thou wilt, to it again," continued the youth; 
 " thou shalt be ordained high priestess of heatheness, 
 and shrine his eminence. Beshrew, my fantasy! if thou 
 hast not chalked thy face guardy, like any mime, and, 
 were my tongue the sacring bell, my lovely transcenden- 
 tal saint here, could not look more stricken: — are ye 
 turned marble both, to save your monuments? What have 
 I spoken, sweetheart? J'ai des Imies, as monsieur puts it; 
 but I never bite, never." The head of Veronica fell 
 abashed ; and, confounded at an address, so startling from 
 its suddenness, she, in silence, turned away. She 
 regretted the circumstance of her father's outlawry, 
 having been proclaimed, in the hearing of a third party, of 
 whom her fancy, as his features were bent on hers, seemed 
 to recal some memory, as in a dream. — His equivocal

 conduct alarmed her, and she looked at the cardinal, for 
 protection. That prelate had been for awhile so occu- 
 pied, with his fair solicitor, as, to have quite forgotten the 
 proximity of Count Rodna, and he was recalled to a con- 
 sciousness of that individual's presence, with an abrupt- 
 ness, that was displeasing. 
 
 Notwithstanding his being accustomed to Sigismund's 
 random, and adventurous sallies, his pungency of remark, 
 on that morning, made a more lively impression on him, 
 than ordinary. The peculiar infirmity of this young 
 nobleman prompted him " to run a-muck and tilt at all 
 he met." Scill, though he would foin, with might and 
 main, no heed was commonly given to his thrusts; his 
 bitterness of invective, serving only to establish the 
 fact of his mental alienation. But, during his brief collo- 
 quy, with Martinuzzi, the distempered language of Sigis- 
 mund conveyed a meaning, sufficiently significant, and 
 there lurked an inexplicable " method in his madness," 
 which did not escape the penetration of the cardinal. 
 The consequence was one of those chilling revulsions of 
 the mind, that jar " the electric chain," connecting the 
 opposite extremes of feeling, and which, thrilling along, 
 over a thousand links in the memory of the past, would 
 be apt, in any case, to emasculate the spirits, and affect 
 them, with no common degree of sadness, but Martinuzzi 
 had still a stronger cause for the depression, which at- 
 tacked him, and v;ith which he could, with difficulty cope. 
 A series of retrospections of most mysterious, and dreadful 
 import rose, in all their inscrutable darkness, to his mind, 
 and their deduction came upon him with the force, at 
 once, and the vivacity of a flash of lightning, 
 
 " And every slack'ned fibre, dropt its hold, 
 Like nature letting down ihe springs of life."* 
 
 It now rushed, with tenfold force, upon his guardian's

 memory, that, on Sigismund's occasional tarriance in 
 Hermanstadt, his presumed aberration of mind, made 
 him free of the citadel; and, more particularly, of Marti- 
 nuzzi's suite of apartments. None ever cared to inquire 
 whether the lad continued to inhabit the Tour rouge, or 
 were on a visit to his guardian. He had the most perfect 
 impunity of locomotion, and might do or say, whatever 
 he listed, since no doubt was entertained, by any person, 
 of his intellects being greatly impaired. 
 
 " If he have been acting all this while," mused Mar- 
 tinuzzi, whilst strong sweat broke upon his forehead; " I 
 must have been suspected, and betrayed, misapprehended, 
 and have been slumbering on the precipice of fate, whilst 
 that clear fame, which is dear to my heart, as is the 
 blood, that bubbles there : — but oh ! impossible, it can- 
 not be — 'tis an idle thought: yet there's a strong impedi- 
 ment here, which weighs me to the earth, — it is the error 
 of my blood, whose current runs more sullen than of 
 old. However, I'll look into his humour. So much is at 
 least due to my safety, my honour, the boy's rights, and 
 welfare, — his father's memory." And, with this intention, 
 Martinuzzi expelled, for the present, the ungracious bode- 
 ment. 
 
 What has taken our tardy pen so long to explain, was, 
 to the mind of Martinuzzi, the result of a minute's 
 thought, but even, in so brief a space of time, his appre- 
 hensions had stamped their dreadful character, upon 
 every miniature of his features, literally, in the words of 
 Sigismund, chalking his guardian's face like any mime, 
 Martinuzzi, however, resolved to confine his newly- 
 awakened suspicion to his own bosom; he, therefore, 
 merely observed, in a tone of forced composure : " I 
 thought, Sigismund, you had left the hall ;" and again 
 addressing himself to Veronica, whose eloquent eyes, 
 bent on the ground, refused to glisten through their 
 silken fringes, he said, *' We'll renew our talk here- 
 after. I will now, my daughter, give you what you

 asked of me," and he turned away, to trace the re- 
 quired order. In the meanwhile, Sigismund launched 
 forth, in that flighty style, ordinary to him : " Meek-eyed 
 votaress to filial piety !" he exclaimed, shedding on his 
 fair auditor the full blaze of his handsome eyes, " would 
 that I knew thy pantronymic, that I might offer up in- 
 cense, on the altar, I have built to thee in my soul. 1 here 
 would I sacrifice pure thoughts, and holy hopes, and 
 loyal aspirations — unshaken faith, and star-like piety — 
 the soft, and cherished charities of the hearth — friend- 
 ship, and kindred trusts, and plumed patriotism, now 
 waving high above the kingly crest, and, anon, the 
 crowning: ensi2:n of the warrior's wreath ; all will I cast 
 
 DO 
 
 down at the feet of thy loveliness." 
 
 Shrinkingly, Veronica listened to the foregoing tirade ; 
 she recognised, in the voice, and gestures of the speaker, 
 a secret charm, that thrilled the mute chords of her 
 sliding heart, and awakened many a forgotten memory. 
 At every pause, she felt inclined to interpose, in order to 
 impress the youthful rhapsodist, with a becoming defer- 
 ence, for the prescriptive majesty of her sex, but she 
 found it difficult to adjust a suitable reproof, or arrange 
 her ideas into the reserved, and formal phrase, she deemed 
 appropriate. Not a little disconcerted, she moved to- 
 wards Martinuzzi, whose silence, during his ward's com- 
 plimentary effusion, had a different source. When, how- 
 ever, at last, the outpourings of Sigismund's spirit had 
 fallen to a pause, and Veronica, to hide the blushes, 
 which burnt upon her cheek, or, perhaps, her displea- 
 sure, turned away, Martinuzzi, with a faint smile, inti- 
 mated to the young count, that his extempore declara- 
 tion of attachment, however natural, was not quite in 
 accordance with the ordinary forms of politesse. 
 
 " 'Tis not well done, my son," he said, " to start the 
 innocent blush, from the pure heart, into the light of 
 day. The fair sex are privileged, from all hasty approach, 
 by the chevaux-de-frize of studied forms, and courtly ob-

 servances — to overstep which limits, though you employ 
 the choicest terms of adulation, were to penetrate the 
 heart you aim at, like unto that fabled falchion, which 
 froze, while it left a wound." 
 
 *' It is hard," replied Sigismund, whilst his mien and 
 gesture decidedly indicated insanity, and even the lines 
 of bis face, appeared to work, in correspondence with his 
 words, that one can never be intent, on any little affair 
 of the heart, but your eminence, with your solemn jar- 
 gon, will whip one from the prospect. It was only last 
 year, you denied me the company of that budding gilly- 
 flower of the palace, whom the people, God forgive them 
 for it ! nickname their queen. You must practise frowns 
 in private on the maid, to awe her with, or you had hardly 
 terrified her grace in the way you did, by smiling ; and, 
 what's worse, I am not likely to encounter the lady's 
 beauties again, before her coronation at Coloswar, whose 
 advent is as near, to all appearance, as is her canoniza- 
 tion, since both, alike, await your eminence's pleasure. 
 
 ** It is my province," returned Martinuzzi, speaking 
 with some little asperity of voice, and manner, (perhaps, 
 from not exactly approving of the free, and caustic tone, 
 adopted by his ward), *' to have regard to the interests 
 of the Lady Czerina, and the living daughter of John of 
 Zapola shall not, while I hold authority, be made the 
 footstool of any man's ambition." 
 
 " I applaud your determination, most absolute pro- 
 tector ; but who shall prohibit you yourself, from making 
 her corpse your stair of empire," replied the other, with 
 a bitter scornful laugh ; " besides, her beams, that, if 
 they shine not on all alike, should, at least, be veiled, 
 are too much pointed : there's an exception to your rule 
 of state." 
 
 " Ha ! let me look on that man in Hungary," returned 
 Martinuzzi, in a voice, both raised, and shaken, by his feel- 
 ings, " bold enough to tamper, with my ordinance, in re-

 spect to her grace, and the life-weary slave shall bitterly 
 rue it !" 
 
 ** In Hungary, my lord? — a-hem ! but you have not 
 to seek far," responded Sigismund. ''The secretary to 
 the Austrian ambassador, Marc Antoine Ferraro, is this 
 slave." 
 
 Martinuzzi started. — " But see," continued the count, 
 '' where the Graf, Maximilian Pereny, hies him hither- 
 ward. I must show the coxcomb a fair pair of heels for't. 
 I partly perceive, your nephew would fain wear my 
 livery, but I'm as loath as your eminence, to part with 
 my cap and bells, or yield a jot of my prerogative." 
 
 Martinuzzi made no reply ; and, addressing Veronica, 
 the count said, " Adieu I for the present, fair creature; 
 I leave ray late embosomed inmate to thy tender mercies : 
 keep watch, and ward o'er it, for 'tis a mine may repay 
 thy culture." Then, after a pause, turning to Martinuzzi, 
 he spake forth, with stern, and marked emphasis, " Look 
 to your nephew's courses. Lord High Cardinal ! The 
 towering eagle may stretch, and mount against the sun; 
 his princely nature, nay, his heritage, bids him perch on 
 clouds ; but 'tis not so with birds of meaner pinion : 
 should the seeled dove, with faint, unequal wing, dare 
 tour, with upward speed, along the thin, and dizzy paths 
 of light, let him reckon upon the falcon's check, nor cross 
 his eminent track, and shun his beetling landmarks. Tell 
 Maximilian Pereny so much, and, — but I crave pardon; 
 your eminence must have enough on your conscience, 
 without being burdened, by a fool's defiance, or made the 
 go-between of a jester, and a popinjay." So saying, with 
 a graceful obeisance to the cardinal, and a deeper to Ve- 
 ronica, who irresolutely returned the courtesy, the noble 
 and interesting youth, stealing a long look at the maiden, 
 which expressed a world of unutterable devotion, slowly 
 backed out of the hall. 
 
 Martinuzzi gazed after him, with a countenance, in 
 which doubt mingled with admiration. " Yes," tliouo-ht

 he, " it must be the dim midnight of his mind, and the 
 labouring judgment eclipses, at the unsubstantial co- 
 zenage of his brain. I will make sure, however, and sound 
 that Swartz to the core, and shortly." 
 
 Martinuzzi was here recalled to the business of the 
 moment, as his eyes turned in the direction, where Ve- 
 ronica awaited the signal of her dismissal. " My child," 
 he said, recovering from his momentary emotion, '* I 
 had forgotten — go now to your father ; you have not 
 long to stay with him. It will hinge upon his future 
 fealty, the assurance of which, I have means he little 
 dreams of, to arrive at, whether, for your sake, I pardon 
 his past entanglements ; but, if shapes of crowns continue 
 to shake him, like comets, prompt him, my love, from the 
 lord regent, that no earthly power can avert the conse- 
 quence ; so bid him break the involving net, and make 
 his fate his minister, by self-control. Nay, nay, tremble 
 not," he added, with a kind, and encouraging accent; 
 " bid your father cease, henceforth, to grasp at shadowy 
 sceptres, and I doubt not, that the untoward concur- 
 rence of unhappy circumstances, which, for so long, hath 
 overcast his fortunes, will shortly be dispersed, as the 
 glowing influence of the new-born day dispels the illu- 
 sions of the night." With these words, Martinuzzi pro- 
 ceeded to summon an attendant, and, having placed the 
 damsel under his conduct, dismissed her, with a parting 
 benediction. 
 
 Veronica followed her conductor, with her eyes cast 
 on the ground, and wrapped in painful meditation ; but 
 she had not gone many steps along the corridor, when 
 her chaste ears were saluted, by a strange, affected voice, 
 exclaiming — ** By Venus' doves! an armful of most rare 
 delicacies ! — the philtre of her lips were heavenly 
 nectar I — Jove ! but my uncle hath a taste — by'r lady ! 
 How fly her blushes out from Cupid's armory ! — Art 
 married, sweetheart ?" The affronted maiden, who had 
 stopt short at first unconsciously, now drew herself up,

 in order to pour out, in one concentrated glance of her 
 bright eyes, the virtuous reproof, which swelled her bo- 
 som, and armed her cap-a-pee, with its crimson tide. 
 The individual, who, at a short distance, stood eyeing 
 her, with the utmost assurance, leant his elbow on the 
 balustrade, with that free, and easy air of effrontery, 
 which his vanity persuaded him was irresistible. He 
 was a tall, raw-boned, strongly built, ill-featured dandy, 
 the distinguishing expression of whose countenance was 
 imbecility, with a strong cast of self-conceit. In matters 
 of costume, he was manifestly an ultra, being apparelled 
 in as finical, and flaunting a garb, as the fashion of the 
 day admitted of. The tie of his scarf, and the nice ad- 
 justment of his doublet, were matters to admire. But, 
 however the cut, and shape of his rich, passamented suit 
 might exhibit proof of an exquisite fancy, and rare con- 
 ceit, the little taste, or judgment shown in the adaptation 
 of one colour to another, and the profuse embroidery, 
 which overcharged, without exception, every article of 
 vestment, not to mention the bad arrangement of the 
 whole, stamped the character of the man, and served to 
 determine, with how small a share of common sense, the 
 vain attribute of lord of the creation, might consist. He 
 appeared to have seen five-and-twenty summers. 
 
 Veronica raised her head, with the intention, as we 
 have said, to awe down his presumption, with one piercing 
 phillippic of her beautiful eyes ; but she found her object 
 frustrated, by the abrupt departure of the unmannered 
 coxcomb. Before she could again pass on, she dis- 
 covered, that his sudden disappearance was occasioned, 
 by the apparition of a man, enveloped in monkish ha- 
 biliments. With his head declined upon his breast, 
 and face, sunk wuthin the cowl of his habit, this person 
 glided along, like a spectre. 
 
 As soon as the usher of Veronica descried the fearful 
 figure, he exhibited unequivocal symptoms of terror, 
 ejaculating, in a whispering voice — " Mary preserve

 US ! — haste ! — Father Dominick !" Then, without 
 adding a syllable of explanation, he set an example of 
 that celerity, he recommended, and, darting forwards, his 
 rapid walk very soon had all the character of a flight — 
 so that Veronica was fain to exert her utmost speed, in 
 order to keep pace with him. The man did not once 
 slacken his steps, as he traversed sundry staircases, and 
 corridors, until he reached an arched, and massive 
 postern, which, heavy with iron-work, creaked harshly 
 on its hinges. This was the entrance to the dungeons 
 of the citadel, where we leave the maiden, for the 
 present. 
 
 On Maximilian Pereny coming into the hall, shortly 
 after Veronica's departure, he did not, at first, notice the 
 presence of his uncle, but looked obliquely behind him, 
 apparently in apprehension of some one, following in his 
 track. The authoritative voice of the regent, however, 
 arrested his attention. " Come hither, sir," said the 
 prelate, " I have words to utter, whose type is in my 
 heart, and has, ere now, cost me much anguish; — 
 attend to me." 
 
 Pereny bared his brow of its beavered saki,* with 
 waving estridge plume ; and, as Martinuzzi raised him- 
 self, on the rich regal seat, assumed a deferential attitude. 
 At that moment, the same awful form, which, only the 
 instant before, had scared Maximilian from the adjoining 
 corridor, slowly glided, into the hall. Having measured, 
 with inaudible tread, and with visage, inclined to the 
 earth, the entire extent of the marbled flooring, the monk, 
 in solemn silence, drew from his bosom a paper, which 
 he delivered into the regent's hands. Then, turning 
 away, with the same echoless movement of the sandalled 
 foot as before, the mysterious being made his exit, through 
 a door, different from that, by which he had entered. At 
 the awe-inspiring obtrusion of the unholy father, Maxi-

 milian's heart trembled, with superstitious fears ; chill 
 horror curdled in his veins, and relaxed his joints, as the 
 cowled, and terrible ostent directed his stately motions 
 tow^ards him, and he experienced no inconsiderable relief, 
 on his retiring. 
 
 As Martinuzzi's eye passed rapidly over the paper, 
 just put into his hands by his confessor, he seemed to 
 take in, at a glance, its purport, which stole the colour 
 from his cheek, and lip. He suffered his head to droop 
 upon his chest, and instantly became so utterly lost, as to 
 forget, that any one was present. He may even have 
 been unaware, that his thoughts framed speech, as, with 
 a quivering lip, he murmured, looking at the paper^ 
 " ' To Luke Swartz,' — So, — ' Now that Peter is slain, 
 his followers flock to my standard by thousands — but 
 Alaric Polgar is yet to be gained — you understand —

 Iwan ! Indeed ! we must make you welcome then, young 
 gentleman ! How have my apprehensions sent a shadow, 
 black as Erebus, which could never be, were they not 
 substantive ! Yet how is this ? — Iwan in secret cor- 
 respondence with Swartz ! with Swartz,— the man who — 
 oh no! there is no such falsehood. Earth could not

 spread it about him, like a plague. My faith in Swartz 
 built on a spider's web ! Swartz, upon whose fidelity 
 I relied, as upon the pillars of creation — I'll not be-

 as one absorbed in thought, and then again commenced, 
 half audibly, with himself. " And yet this is more than 
 suspicious ; it denotes previous conspiracy ; 'tis a sha- 
 dow, cast, by by-gone days, and nights, and years of 
 treachery, over the whole vista of glory, on which I

 am I ! Hemmed in on all sides, whilst my miseries 
 haunt me, like blood-hounds ; yea, even on that point of 
 retreat, whence first I started, they head me back. It 
 cannot last — be still, — how then ? I must select, and 
 spring upon the foremost foeman. What, ho ! who 
 waits ?" An attendant appeared. '^ Hie thee to the 
 apartments of Viscount Rodna," said the lord regent, 
 " and order the ingrate — I mean the keeper — to attend 
 me, in my cabinet, and there await my coming." 
 '' Swartz, your eminence ?" inquired the man. 
 " Did I not say so, sir?" said Martinuzzi, with un- 
 usual asperity. The attendant left the hall, and the 
 regent, pressing his hands to his brow, exclaimed, " What 
 drops are these, have gathered on my forehead ?" Then, 
 in a subdued, and melancholy tone, he went on — " Yes, 
 I strain, as doth the soaring eagle, entangled in the folds 
 of the green serpent, that tires upon her heart; and feel, 
 perhaps, like her." The regent paused ; he covered his 
 eyes with his hands, as if to shade some painful emotion. 
 Presently, with a violent effort, recovering himself, he 
 walked up and down the hall, for a few moments, and 
 then turned suddenly towards his nephew, who stood an 
 astonished witness of Martinuzzi's discomposure. 
 
 *' What do you, sir," asked the regent, abruptly, 
 " with that purple on your shoulder?" 
 
 Maximilian coloured, and he hesitated to reply. 
 " Will you please to attend, sir! What do you with 
 that purple?" re-demanded Martinuzzi; *' 1 desire an 
 answer to my question." 
 
 *' May it not displease your eminence," replied Pereny, 
 '' 'tis a scarf of sendal — a kind of — a most choice piece 
 of raiment — truly of very felicitous cut, and of the 
 newest fantasie." 
 
 " 1 spoke of the colour, sir," said Martinuzzi, with 
 severe emphasis. 
 
 " Why, I cannot say much for the colour, if it dislike 
 vour eminence," answered the other.

 " It doth offend me, sir," returned the cardinal, whilst 
 a shade of dark displeasure settled on his countenance. 
 " In common with every honest man in Hermanstadt, it 
 offends me, to behold the laurel round thy temples — to 
 mark a mindless, inconsiderate dolt, strutting and swell- 
 ing-, like the frog- in the fable. Everlasting shame ! the 
 blossom, which thou hast plucked, and wound, as 'twere 
 a chaplet, within thy hair, shall never grow a fruit, nor 
 glisten, but the day long, on thy forehead. That gar- 
 ment, too ! Sir, it is a basilisk in my eyes. Nearer." 
 
 Maximilian approached the cardinal, who, unloosen- 
 ing the invidious emblem, from his nephew's shoulders, 
 rent it asunder, and trampled the shreds under his feet. 
 "There I" he exclaimed, with vehemence, '^ tear it to 
 rags ! Is this a time," the regent continued, " when the 
 enemies of Hungary ride the country, with arrayed ban- 
 ners, to perk your folly, in the face of the land ? Who 
 put into thy mind a robe, like that ? Wer't drunk, to as- 
 sume it, and incense the wise, and valiant, who now throng 
 this city, in the forlorn hope of averting the shipwreck of 
 the state — wert drunk, I ask ?" 
 
 " The forlorn hope, your eminence ?" repeated Maxi- 
 milian, in the tone of interrogatory, and with no small 
 symptoms of astonishment. 
 
 " Such were my words, young man," answered Marti- 
 nuzzi ; " and 'tis one of the signs of the times," he con- 
 tinued, "not the least portentous, that thy borrowed 
 feathers have not, ere yet, been plucked, and thy reflected 
 light extinguished. Did this devoted land, or your 
 uncle's government, promise aught of durable, you may 
 rest assured, that Hungary, however fallen, lacks neither 
 heart, nor arm, sinew, nor will, to put a date to your 
 pretensions. Whoso scattereth the seeds of hatred, and 
 suspicion, in his path, must look to reap a bloody har- 
 vest." 
 
 " Nathless, my lord, I may outlive the wound, and, 
 perhaps, the assassin," observed Maximilian ; " and who

 should be the slabbers, that should do the deed you 
 threaten ?" he added, with an assumption of hauteur, 
 and in an affected, and arrogant voice. 
 
 " Patriots, sir," answered the cardinal, in a deep, 
 stern voice ; " and, however you may flatter yourself," 
 he presently subjoined, "there are, in Hermanstadt, who 
 merit that title, ay, many, who would plunge their dag- 
 gers, through your slashed jerkin, did they see cause." 
 
 '' I should be glad to look upon such," returned Maxi- 
 milian, with emphasis; bearing himself, at the same time, 
 in a manner, not altogether unbecoming his high lineage; 
 " can your eminence instruct me how, and where, I may 
 most probably fall in with the butchers, you boast of?" 
 
 "They abound, just now, about the palace, nephew, 
 and in the vicinity of the court," answered Martinuzzi, 
 evasively. 
 
 " Would you describe only one, my lord," said Maxi- 
 milian, drawing himself up, into an attitude of defiance, 
 *' I would save him, from fulfilling your kind augury, if 
 his doublet be passable to sword, or pistol. Name but 
 one, your eminence." 
 
 "The lord regent of Hungary," replied the prelate, 
 sternly, "did he believe you worthy of his wrath ; but 
 ?ie knows you, sir, and you have leave to ruffle it, for 
 him." 
 
 Maximilian bit his lips, and, fixing his eyes on the 
 ground, was silent. 
 
 " Maximilian," resumed the cardinal, " tell me what 
 fools, and blows you up, like bubbles, thus ? Have I 
 toiled, for years, to build myself a name, for you to pluck 
 up the foundations ? Understand, my lord, you have nei- 
 ther weight of character, nor competent talent, nor one 
 distinguishing requisite, that I know of, to constitute you 
 the fitting minister of any body of men, even in holyday 
 times, leave alone, in such an angry, and disjointed era, 
 as that, we are doomed to jostle in ; you can put forth no 
 merits of your own, none personal, or proper to yourself;

 your solitary hope of making way with the Magyar Or- 
 sag, must be derived from the name, you unworthily bear, 
 but which, in fact, only recals to men's minds, the great 
 deeds of your ancestors, as witnesses of your degene- 
 racy. * As it is, your influence will expire, when I abdi- 
 cate my office, and that may occur sooner, than, possibly, 
 you look for." 
 
 ''You do not mean it, your eminence," exclaimed 
 Maximilian; ''you can never intend to quail your high 
 honours, to the violent, and vindictive policy of Isabella. 
 Oh ! you will never condescend to hold your life, as 
 tenant at will, from her. Have you not long had letters 
 missive from his holiness, bearing the grant or donation 
 of Transylvania, as an appanage of your rank? And will 
 you forego such a splendid acquisition ?" 
 
 " And were I to accept the sceptre," replied the car- 
 dinal, " I have yet to discover, how the circumstance 
 would operate to your advantage. I own to you, that, 
 formerly, I indulged the hope, that the son of Peter 
 Pereny, by an uniform, persevering course, in arts and 
 arms, might have deserved well of his country, and even, 
 perhaps, at one time or another, have found favour, in the 
 sight of the Lady Czerina." 
 
 " My lord, such may yet be the case," said Maximi- 
 lian. 
 
 " Never," replied the cardinal. " 1 repeat, there was 
 a period, when I held such an opinion ; but I must in- 
 form you, 'tis now many years since." 
 
 Maximilian would again have interposed, but the car- 
 dinal, without breaking off, with solemn earnestness pro- 
 ceeded ; "You lay claim to an interest in my blood, Maxi- 
 milian, and, from your earliest childhood, I have done all 
 in my power to advantage your prospects, whether of this 
 brief, phantasmal scene, or those, which centre in the

 brighter realities of eternity. For this, I require no 
 thanks ; I am accountable to Heaven for the trust, which 
 your father left in my hands. Besides myself, Maximi- 
 lian, you have scarcely a relative upon earth; certainly, 
 not oncj whose recognition would greatly delight, or 
 credit you. I have been your only, but, hitherto, your 
 powerful, and steady protector. I owe it to the memory 
 of my sister, ever, whilst my name can serve you, to lend 
 you all its lustre, to let you trim your feeble lamp, at the 
 bright flame of my glory. Of three children, two bro- 
 thers and a sister, your parent was, by far, the most 
 estimable ; but, alas ! sh-e soon sought the home of her 
 nativity. The goodness of God, in still blessing my poor 
 abilities, has since exalted me to my present distinguished 
 rank in tlie state. Wherefore, think you, do I advert to 
 these things? In order to put it to you, seriously, whe- 
 ther, in the absence of all intrinsic desert, you can trust 
 to cabal, or party, to invest you with real, and lasting 
 dignity? Why should you launch into the ocean of pub- 
 lic life, without rudder or compass, and, above all, why 
 alarm the national pride, by the impolitic and premature 
 avowal of a design, which, it is my prayer to Heaven, 
 that stubborn necessity may frustrate. Pereny, other 
 Hungarians may have pointed out the Huniades and the 
 Stradiote for their example ; but, as your greatest glory is 
 your father's name, so does the moral of his life furnish 
 your best instruction.* It might warn you, that incom- 
 petent ambition is one of the most pitiable species of self- 
 deception, bearing, in its very principle, the germs of its 
 own exposure, and defeat. Let me advise you to mode- 
 rate your desires, to the level of your mediocrity of talent. 
 Panoply thee, with all my heart, Maximilian, in the war- 
 rior's garb ; let thy body groan under iron harness, and

 teach your lance, in the vanward of the battle, to pioneei 
 your way to greatness. Would you ascend the steep o. 
 fame, you will have to struggle into eminence ; to fight 
 your way, step by step, and every inch of your ground you 
 must contest, and, again and again, by cheerful submis- 
 sion to toil, and amid the laborious details of discipline, 
 vindicate your right, to blend your name with your sire's, 
 and country's. Purple your hands deep, in the blood of 
 Austria, and your uncle will be the first, to applaud their 
 ensanguined hue; but not your raiment, Maximilian, not 
 your raiment ; and hereafter, thou wouldst do wisely, to 
 place a shroud, before that solitary colour of a king, which 
 sits on thee, like death."* 
 
 " Death, uncle!" echoed Maximilian. 
 
 " Death, sir, to which 'twill lead you," replied the 
 regent ; " you have no title on earth, to arrogate to your- 
 self the insignia of empire. Your father might not, in 
 his proudest days ; how then should you ?" 
 
 Maximilian's displeasure was pourtrayed on his coun- 
 tenance ; he, however, kept silence ; but shortly after- 
 wards, as if the thought had suddenly struck him, he 
 said, with an inquiring look, " You mentioned, even 
 now, another brother of my mother — is he living?" 
 
 The cardinal knit his brows, but remained silent. 
 
 Maximilian felt his curiosity excited, and, after a pause, 
 he ventured to repeat the inquiry : " If," said he, " I 
 have an uncle, besides your eminence, in existence, what 
 is he ?" 
 
 "A villain!" answered Martinuzzi, in a voice of 
 thunder. '' A most consummate villain !" In utterino

 these words, a flush passed over his brow ; but, almost 
 directly, he subjoined, in a milder tone, as if feeling 
 ashamed, at having expressed himself, with such unwonted 
 warmth — " One, Maximilian, who may yet — who may yet,

 quities. It is my daily prayer. Speak not of him." 
 
 To the mandate conveyed, in these last words, the cu- 
 riosity of Pereny rendered Jjiim loath to submit ; but he 
 forbore to answer, and the regent, after casting his eye 
 over the paper, he still held in his hand, said, '' An affair 
 of moment now calls me away ; treasure up what I have 
 spoken, and endeavour, for the future, ' so to order your 
 conduct, as neither to abuse, nor waste the glory, left you 
 by your ancestors.' * I tell thee, the sure, slow-wheel- 
 ing hours, which time the evolution of ages, even now 
 let loose the fate of Hungary, and her regent. Yet a lit- 
 tle while, and both may subsist only in memory. Champ 
 upon this bit, Maximilian, and act accordingly." In 
 saying these words, the cardinal went forth, leaving his 
 nephew standing, with vacant aspect, gazing, in the di- 
 rection, which that personage had taken, and, apparently, 
 hearkening to his receding footsteps, long after the sound 
 could have possibly reached his ears. Then, rousing him- 
 
 * See the dialogue of Plato, entitled Menexenus.— Antiquit)? cannot 
 furnish a more admirable piece of oratory than that (placed in the mouth 
 of Aspasia the Milesian) from whence the sentence, quoted above, is 
 dishonoured into English. It was repeated every year, on the anniversary 
 of Marathon, and preferred, by the Athenians, to tlie orations composed 
 on the same subject, by their greatest orators, Pericles, Lysias, Hyperides, 
 and Demosthenes. Whatever Anaximenes may pretend, and Plutarch 
 repeat after him, of their originating with Solon, this is the first occa- 
 sion of funeral eulogiums occurring among the Greeks. With the Ro- 
 mans, the custom was already established. The oration ascribed to Pe- 
 ricles in the historian is, in all probability, a characteristic sketch of 
 Thucydides, whose speeches, however appropriate, are not given with the 
 accuracy of a Times reporter. That of Lysias we have not read. The 
 other two have fallen a sacrifice to the edax vetustas, which Shirley 
 calls, " the cruel teeth of Time." We the less scruple, putting the ideas 
 of Plato, into the mouth of Martinuzzi^ because the eloquence of the pre- 
 late, by a sort of 7rei9avayict], — an equal exertion of force and persuasion, 
 -—was commonly irresistible, and in his cradle (as was said of the Greek 
 phdosopher) a swarm of bees seemed to gather round his lips.

 self, he settled his saki* with its sweeping plume, to the 
 becoming angle, on his forehead, and shaking the lofty 
 feather, by the haughty movement of his head, sallied 
 forth, somewhat precipitately, in quest of those, who 
 might afford him their counsel, in this emergency. 
 
 The understanding of Maximilian Pereny, was of that 
 ordinary calibre, which corresponded not ill with his 
 personal appearance. He possessed considerable pride, 
 but little dignity ; and, ascribing the continued favour of 
 Martinuzzi entirely to his distinguished deserts, neither 
 the invariable indulgence, nor the occasional correction, 
 of his uncle, was capable of making any lasting impres- 
 sion, on such a temper. The repeated admonitions, and 
 the gentleness, of the regent, alike failed to bridle the 
 haughty, insolent, and overbearing spirit of the youth. 
 The care taken for so many years, in appointing proper 
 persons, to superintend his conduct, could not detach 
 him, from the dissipation of amusement, or the allure- 
 ments of the lowest sensuality. He was addicted to in- 
 ebriety, and that to a degree, which exceeded the ordi- 
 nary endurance of that age, and was far from consonant 
 to contemporary habits. He would often indulge in the 
 most shameless abandonment of passion, which gave um- 
 brage to thinking men ; and the coarseness of his de- 
 baucheries, even the extreme license of youth might 
 hardly serve to palliate. Thus, devoted to all the levities, 
 and prone to many of the vices of his age, and country, 
 that iMaximilian should become the dupe of his own 
 headlong propensities, and overweening vanity, was the 
 natural sequence. The lord of a powerful domain, 
 he felt himself called upon, to take a prominent 
 part, in the affairs of Hungary, at that important 
 crisis. He aspired to grasp the falling mantle of the 
 prophet, and eagerly looked forward to the day, when 
 his uncle would think fit, to slacken his hold on power,

 and relinquish, into his hands, his delegated authority. 
 But, to his chagrin, Martinuzzi did not appear, by any 
 means, in a hurry, to cut out of the game ; although, that he 
 purposed, sooner or later, to retire into a private station, 
 and substitute his nephew to the fatigues, and glory of 
 office, was what his hopeful kinsman never suffered him- 
 self to doubt. 
 
 It is at all times difficult, and usually impossible, to 
 conceive the actuating motives, if, indeed, there be any 
 such, which influence a trifling, and irregular mind ; the 
 *' true no meaning" of the poet cannot readily be com- 
 passed, and we find ourselves afloat, on a sea of conjec- 
 ture, and all to no purpose. If it were not for this cause 
 of hesitancy, we might, perhaps, and with some colour of 
 reason, pronounce the ruling passion of Pereny, at this 
 period, to have been ambition, although (as had been the 
 case with his father) his hopes of success were so appa- 
 rently founded on inordinate vanity, that never was the 
 celebrated sentiment of the lyric poet, more applicable.* 
 Still, if we may not form any satisfactory conjecture re- 
 specting the grounds of his confidence, we conclude, 
 witli great probability, that, viewing his merits, in the 
 glass of self-love and flattery, Maximilian vainly im^agined 
 that, like another Atlas, his shoulders could sustain the 
 poles of empire. 
 
 He, who knew not how to rule his own rebellious na- 
 ture, was eager to make himself accountable to his coun- 
 try, and to posterity, for the happiness of millions. So 
 reaching is the appetite of the human mind, however 
 eunuch, and ungenerative its capacity ! This high opinion 
 of his personal merit, which the arrogant self-sufficiency 
 of Maximilian entertained, was assiduously cultivated and 
 encouraged by his immediate followers, who, seeing, in 
 their imagination, the crown of St. Stephen glitter on 
 the brow of their weak, and misguided patron, trusted,

 one day or other, to find their own account, in his ad- 
 vancement, and distinction. They readily entered into 
 all his views, however absurd. Their oil-tongued syco- 
 phancy, ministered to every scheme, which his impetu- 
 ous temper was naturally set upon, and they watched, 
 and improved every occasion of insinuating- themselves 
 into his confidence, by accommodating their counsels 
 to his inclinations, and rendering themselves neces- 
 sary to the accomplishment of his wishes. It thus, un- 
 happily for Maximilian Pereny, came to pass, that he 
 could conceive no design, of however unprincipled, or 
 even criminal a description, which would not immediately 
 obtain furtherers and abetters, in those restless, and time- 
 serving characters, whom his lavish expenditure, and 
 perhaps his personal accomplishments, attached to him. 
 
 However, notwithstanding this general deference of 
 his adherents, there might be found one, or two, excep- 
 tions, and his most intimate associate, the Graf Bathori, 
 invariably consulted, what he deemed to be Maximilian's 
 true interests, even when (as was often the case) they ran 
 counter to his inclinations. He never concurred in any 
 scheme, or recommended any proceeding, which he did 
 not think would conduce to the reputation of Pereny. 
 He hoped, doubtless, to ingratiate himself with his pa- 
 tron, by his zeal for his honour ; and his advice might be 
 equally interested, with that of the rest: but it was more 
 judicious, and founded on what, he trusted, would promote 
 Maximilian's real service, and be for his eventual benefit. 
 
 That person did not exactly relish the tone, and temper 
 of his uncle's lecture; on whose departure, he repaired 
 to the court-yard of the castle, where he fell in with Ve- 
 ronica, who had just quitted her father's prison, for the 
 night. The gentle girl, who was too deeply absorbed, by 
 her proper sorrows, to afford any heed to passing objects, 
 was hurrying homewards, with her eyes fixed on the 
 rugged pave ; and while thridding the steep, and narrow 
 windings of the city, was so wholly engrossed with her

 own thoughts, as to be unaware, that a young cavalier, 
 splendidly attired, was close beside her; and had passed 
 and repassed her, more than once, during the last five 
 minutes, ever and anon staring broadly at her, and scru- 
 tinizing lier beautiful face, and figure, with marked in- 
 tensity of admiration. Accommodating his walk to hers, 
 the coxcomb in question, advanced, or slackened his pace, 
 according as hers was accelerated, or diminished. How 
 much longer his mute, but somewhat exaggerated, demon- 
 strations of regard, could have escaped the observation of 
 their fair object, cannot be told, since they were shortly 
 interrupted, by the abrupt exit of Veronica, from the 
 scene. Pereny, who, only the instant before, had rudely 
 gazed back, upon the pensive countenance of the uncon- 
 scious maiden, on again directing his eyes towards their 
 guide and cynosure, found, to his astonishment, she had 
 " melted, as breath into the wind." 
 
 There were now few passengers abroad, for the dusk of 
 twilight was fast deepening into darkness, and the shadows 
 of the projecting stories of the wooden buildings, fell 
 gloomily down one side of the street. " Whither can the 
 siren have vanished?" thought Maximilian, not a little 
 nettled at her disappearance; — "into that house, to the 
 right, I'll be sworn, but I'll unearth her, let her burrow 
 ever so cunningly." With this view, he would have in- 
 continently passed the threshold of the cottage, when a 
 gentle pressure on his shoulder, arrested his intention. 
 He turned to face the person, who had thus taken him 
 off his guard, whom he instantly recognized. 
 
 ''Ha, Bathori !" he exclaimed; "by the word of a 
 prince, you startled me; I have come abroad, on purpose 
 to speak with you." 
 
 " Your highness, then, on your way, seems to have 
 undergone the influence of a cold, and potent spell," re- 
 turned the other; " for, on that ground, have you grown 
 for the last five minutes, as if transfixed, by the wand of 
 some fell enchanter."

 lovely as Psyche, ere she wed, — as light, and full of 
 grace ; but not ether, man! — Not ether ! at least I think 
 so ; although, while one might truss a point,* she was 
 off; and, by my uncle's cap! she evanesced, in a very 
 ethereal sort of fashion : like a flitting shadow, or a 
 soft creation of beautiful breath. Bathori ! Bathori \" he 
 continued, laying his hand impressively, on the arm of 
 the baron ; " were it to cost me half my heritage, as sure 
 as there are seven sacraments, I will possess this girl, ere 
 her maidenhood be riper, by another sunset." 
 
 " Your highness, I apprehend, will have to double 
 your bidding, and, perhaps, not, after all, attain your 
 gratification," replied, the other, 
 
 *' Ha ! what mean you?" said Maximilian. 
 
 Bathori hesitated, in his endeavour to select such 
 words, as might intimate his sentiments, yet save him 
 from giving offence. " I wish, without hurting your 
 feelings," he said, " I knew how to bring your highness, 
 to a sense of what is expected of the man, who aspires to 
 reign in Hungary." 
 
 " Speak out, in the fiend's name," answered Pereny, 
 " only be brief." 
 
 " My words may sound harsh," continued Bathori, 
 with great gravity ; " but physicians affirm, the more nau- 
 seous the drug to the mouth, the more likely is there to 
 be healing in it." 
 
 " Zounds! my lord," interrupted Maximilian, " I have 
 swallowed, within this hour, as bitter a potion, as thy 
 skill ever compounded."

 " I am sorry, it lias not proved more efficacious," re- 
 joined the other, with a smile : " prithee, who was your 
 mediciner ?"

 "And the prescription ?" 
 
 *' To be on my good behaviour, at the peril of his 
 favour." 
 
 " Did his eminence deliver himself in anger?" 
 " I never saw him excited to such a pitch of vehe- 
 mence before," observed Maximilian; "and, what was 
 worse, he tipped me a touch of the heroic, and tore 
 my new purple manto, — that, you know, which was fa- 
 shioned after a device of the dauphin's,— into so many 
 fragments, that not all the milliners in Paris, could sew 
 the shreds together." 
 
 " Oh, my lord ! " said Bathori, with much earnestness, 
 " your uncle, in his heart, has no contempt for such an 
 emblem ; but he deemed it false, and wrong, to stir the 
 injured sense of Erdely, to fear and jealousy, by pouring 
 painful beams into men's sight, which thou shouldst 
 rather persuade to sleep, by thy humble bearing. Mar- 
 tinuzzi must have been much incensed." 
 
 " I am not sure of that," returned Maximilian ; " but 
 rather think, some state matters ruffled his temper. By 
 heavens I he hinted, at abdicating his authority, and 
 talked so darkly, about the mutability of human gran- 
 deur, and all that sort of thing, that, may I perish ! if I

 " Why, that you will never reign in Erdely," said the 
 baron, " if you wager, with wild rashness, your reversion, 
 for the precarious smiles of woman." He paused, and 
 then continued, in a lower, but more earnest tone, than 
 before: "Again, my prince, beware of pleasure! The 
 drained goblet is a charmed mirror, like to a crystal case- 
 ment 'fore the heart, through which each eye may look, 
 except the drinker; — and for the many glancing beams

 of maidens' looks, — ah, your highness ! there may live se- 
 veral fair, like the Lady Czerina, but unto such, thou 
 must be blinder than the Cyclop, if you would not have 
 the world to roll away beneath thy feet. She who is 
 queen, in no respect may brook a rival, par amours; 
 and, if you give her one, my lord, 'tis at the imminent 
 peril of that sacred crown, you will, otherwise, one day 
 share." 
 
 " But her grace shall never learn," began Maximilian, 
 when the other again took up the word. 
 
 ''Ha! your highness, — split not upon that rock; 
 princes, the copies of Divinity, aspire to many of his at- 
 tributes ; amongst others they aim at omnipresence, and 
 they often attain their object, more nearly, than men 
 dream of. Never doubt me, my lord, but your motions 
 are narrowly watched." 
 
 '' By Czerina, surely?" 
 
 " By her mother, your highness." 
 
 " Oil, d — n her mother ! " exclaimed Maximilian, with 
 considerable emphasis. 
 
 "With all my heart, my lord," responded his companion, 
 in a lower key, and making a hasty sign to repress the 
 other's vehemence ; " only curse within your compass; 
 do you not see, that a man, within this minute, has 
 issued from yonder hut," and Bathori pointed to one, 
 that stood a little apart from the general cluster : "if 
 I mistake not, he yet lurks within the dark shadow of 
 that thatched piatza." 
 
 "Thence, Bathori? By my uncle's hat ! 'tis the very 
 shed, through which, if I mistake not, my divinity disap- 
 peared, just as you joined me ! " 
 
 "Through that entrance, say you?" demanded the 
 Graf. 
 
 " Ay, under the sloping roof to the left," returned 
 Maximilian. 
 
 "Then I can tell you all about your charmer."

 '* Thou, Bathori ! Is the kurva a dickey-bird of 
 thine?" 
 
 " Not so, my lord. But, if the maiden be, whom I sus- 
 pect, she is, indeed, an incomparable creature ;" and, in 
 a whispering- voice, the graf very briefly unfolded, to his 
 attentive auditor, the particulars of the arrest of the 
 overnight: "But ha!" he concluded, "I had forgot, 
 beyond a question, that man has not emerged from the 
 front of Hubert's cottage." 
 
 " Now, by the temper of my sword, " exclaimed 
 Maximilian, " be he who he may, I will speak to 
 him." 
 
 " Nay, be advised, my prince, and let's pass on." 
 
 '^ Baron, in this I'll consider nothing, but my plea- 
 sure !" then, turning on the baron, with lighted eye, and 
 boding brow, he cried; " Be so complying, as to loose 
 thy hold on my ruffle; 'tis adjusted jpoint-de-vice, and 
 must not be deranged ; give me way, or, by the Lord of 
 heaven, it shall be worse for you ! " and Maximilian laid 
 hand on his sword's hilt. 
 
 "If your highness would but hearken," said the baron, 
 releasing his hold, " only" — 
 
 The other, on finding himself free, sprung impetu- 
 ously forward. The last faint words of Bathori, either 
 never reached his ear, or failed in changing his pur- 
 pose. 
 
 " Only," proceeded the baron, subduing the tones of 
 his voice, and concluding the sentence differently, from 
 what its commencement promised ; " thou art the most 
 incorrigible ass, that ever pretended to a crown ! I have 
 half a mind to leave thee to thy headlong impulses, and 
 would, but that thy success is indispensable to my own 
 mounting. My foot is yet on the lowest round of that 
 ladder, which thou dost shape and plant, wherewith to 
 scale the top of hilly empire; its base is thy rash, and 
 ill-grounded ambition, — its capital, like the dream of the

 patriarch, is lost in cloud and vapour. I cannot see so 
 far, but, methinks, already the golden circle of empire 
 clips my parched brow, — down ! down ! my swelling- 
 thoughts. Why, oh ! why does my teeming heart bound 
 and rebound, as if to burst its feeble tenement? Why, 
 ever, at the twilight hour, do I thrill to sensations, in- 
 tense, in proportion to the deep mystery of their source ? 
 Ambition is the heavenward vice of noble natures : by 
 that fell Satan. Wherefore, then, should my bosom repu- 
 diate so wild, and divine a sin. Ha ! but let me be sure 
 of my footing, ere I trust myself on the slippery, and un- 
 sure tracks, I am about to tread. — Ambition ! 'tis to 
 venture on a sea of melting ice ! all around crackles at 
 her step : yawning and frequent crannies intervene. She 
 dare not, — she must not retreat; — afar, is situate the 
 perilous and undiscovered shore, — beneath, rolls the deep 
 abyss of waters, lying in wait for its prey ; yet, methinks," 
 he added, " with caution and courage for attendants, 
 she may cross the gulf. The favourite of the Kiral ! — * 
 that sounds well, but, — ha! perchance the word it- 
 self." 
 
 Bathori had suffered the current of his ardent reflec- 
 tions, to carry him thus far, beyond the confines of time 
 and space, when his wild dreams were suddenly dispelled, 
 by the sound of voices, high in argument, immediately 
 succeeded, by the clashing of weapons, at no great dis- 
 tance. He hastened to the spot, whither INIaximilian 
 had preceded him, with the purpose of addressing the 
 individual, whose form lay undistinguishable, in the deep- 
 ening shades of evening. The broad shield of day had 
 now, for some time, sunk down, behind a little ridge, or 
 stony belt, which girded the fortification of Hermanstadt, 
 to the west ; and, although the horizon was illumined in 
 her advent, the moon had not yet arisen, and the few eyes 
 of heaven, overhead, twinkled faintly forth, as only half

 by the projecting fronts of the houses, were wrapped in 
 obscurity, and doubt. 
 
 It was owing to this cause, that the baron had 
 reached the lofty wall, already mentioned, without 
 being made aware, till he came up, that the conflict 
 had found a natural, and speedy close, in the discom- 
 fiture of one of the combatants. On his arrival at the 
 spot, he perceived Maximilian Pereny, stretched upon

 ViRG. 
 
 Isabella, the Queen Regent of Hungary, was in the 
 prime, and full blaze of womanhood, at the period when 
 our present history dates its commencement. Whilst only 
 a child, in respect to her knowledge of the usages of the 
 world, at the command of her father, and not by the 
 dictates of young affection, she had been joined in wed- 
 lock to John Sepusius of Zapola. Whatever sanguine 
 hopes were entertained of this alliance, rested solely, on 
 the frail, and crumbling basis of political expediency. 
 Difficulties, however, shortly intervened, and the measure 
 proved, in its consummation, and results, wearisome, and 
 disastrous. John was considerably her senior in years, 
 and was far from being possessed of that person, or of 
 those features, most readily adapted to seduce, and rivet 
 the affections, or command the respect, of woman. There 
 was none of that voluptuous abandonment in his charac- 
 ter, which the sex is prompt to love, nor of that felicitous 
 daring, which they are wont to admire. The husband of 
 the beautiful daughter ofSigismund, wasjust such a man, 
 as is calculated to wear a girl's heart out, whilst the seat 
 of life and passion throbbed, by night and by day, in the 
 fruitless endeavour to make itself love, and be beloved.

 Yet, it even was to him, that the warm, and noble Isabella 
 plighted her faith at the altar, vowing to honour and 
 obey one, whom she had met, for the first time in her life, 
 only the day preceding, and respecting whose disposition, 
 and claims on her affection, she could know little, or 
 nothing. Ignorant of the world, and unacquainted with 
 the capacity, and boundless sympathies of her own heart, 
 its aptitude for the soft endearments of reciprocal attach- 
 ment, she had fettered the pure, and virgin charities of her 
 nature, ere she knew the value of the sacrifice. For 
 awhile, the child remained unconscious of the extent, and 
 character of her new obligations ; but, alas ! the woman 
 could not be so blinded. As the excitation of novelty, 
 and change ceased to operate, and her faculties expanded 
 to a sense of the relative duties, which belonged to the 
 married state, her passions and her understanding were 
 reciprocally developed ; the film cleared from her mental 
 vision, and she awoke, from her sleep of apathy, to the 
 stern reality of her position. The painted veil of life was 
 rent asunder. The bright gilding, with which her inex- 
 perience had disguised the nature of her shackles, from 
 her view, wore away, and the iron entered her soul. She, 
 who was formed to be the solace, and delight, the com- 
 panion, lover, friend, of some gentle being, as warm, and 
 susceptible, as the embodied creations of her fervid fancy, 
 had been immolated, at the altar of state necessity, and 
 sacrificed to the selfish views of the feudal aristocracy of 
 Hungary. She, who was surely meant, to anchor her 
 earthly hopes, in the bosom of fond confiding love, — to be 
 heart-bare to the man of her choice, and plighted troth, 
 found herself abruptly translated, from the arms of lier 
 mother, to the frigid atmosphere of Bud a, to be mated 
 with one, contemporary with her sire, and who, if not quite 
 so graceful, seemed to the dispirited, and disappointed 
 princess, as polished, and as cold, as the unbreathing 
 marble, wrought to rival the human form. As month, 
 after month, rolled on, and Isabella became gradually

 inured to her purposeless existence, she learnt, indeed, to 
 wear her bonds "with dignity, but not with patience. 
 The spring-dew of her heart was dried up at its source. 
 The sweet, and glowing aspirations of childhood visited 
 her no more ; the delicious freshness of her emotions no 
 longer threw its magic, on the colouring of the minute, or 
 lent an enchantment to the brilliant to-morrow of her 
 destiny. She had tried that to-morrow, and proved its 
 worthlessness. It brought to her no kindred bosom, on 
 which to repose, and pour herself, — no fond, and speaking 
 eye, with which, to interchange the glances of inexpressi- 
 ble affection, — no confiding ear, in which to unburthen 
 the tale of her indurated feelings, and blighted hopes. In 
 the whole universe she had none to spoil her; and what 
 were this bleak world worth, she thought, deprived of the 
 occasional visitation of love, and sympathy ? In the elo- 
 quent words of Shelley — 
 
 " To tread life's dismaying wilderness. 
 
 Without one smile to cheer, one voice to bless, 
 Amid the snares and scoffs of human kind, 
 Is hard." 
 
 Alas! the waywardness of the female heart! "Despite 
 her duty," on the throne of her husband, Isabella yearned 
 after the haunts, and dreams of her maidenhood. In her 
 chaste married bed, she had to suppress the sigh, that 
 struggled for utterance, and dry the scalding tear-drop 
 on her eyelid, and, harder still, to blush, in the darkness of 
 the night, at the commotion of her senses, of which a sigh, 
 and a tear were not the sole interpreters. 
 
 It is not to be inferred, that the king regarded his 
 charming wife, with any sentiments allied to aversion, or 
 that he was insensible to the delicate endearments of con- 
 jugal society. This supposition is confuted, by the evi- 
 dence of history. It is likely, he loved Isabella, as sincere- 
 ly, as it was in his nature to afiect any human being ; but 
 he was constitutionally frigid, and indifferent, and was, 
 mereover, deficient in that particular, in default of which,

 a man, however valuable liis other qualities, seldom 
 makes much impression, on the vacant tenderness of the 
 female heart. He wanted soul, — sensibility, — that vital 
 principle, which gives a zest to the soft communion of the 
 sexes, without whose aid, gallantry is degraded to an idle, 
 and unmeaning pastime, and the hackneyed routine of 
 conjugal life, becomes flat and unfruitful, as the sea-sand. 
 It was this deficiency in King John, that caused, in 
 Isabella, that languishment of the spirit, that besoin 
 (V amour, which stole over her, at intervals, even in the arms 
 of her royal consort. She inferred, from the very depths 
 of her aching sense, she was capable of loving, but did 
 not love; she felt, she had been created to bless, and 
 be blessed in requital; but "it was oh! in her heart," 
 that no blessing waited on her footsteps, — that no 
 cherished thought of her's found a responsive echo, in 
 another's remembrance, — that no approving eye beamed 
 with more vivid satisfaction, at her approach, or became 
 suffused with melancholy, in her absence. She was too 
 great to court affection. Seated on her eirie aloft, she 
 envied the linnet, who might freely nestle, and pair, at 
 the foot of the precipice. She was solitary, unsolaced, 
 joyless, unlinked — for what availed the joining of hands, 
 if there ensued no intellectual connection, — no interchange 
 of the heart? Alas! she felt, (and how truly !) that it 
 was not home, without sympathy, without indulgence. 
 
 Just let loose, from the trammels, and fond cherishing 
 of her childhood, she was like a bark, forced from shore, 
 and cast, without steerage or compass, upon the wild of 
 dreary waves, that swell the flood of time, with no haven 
 in view, that she deemed worthy an effort ; and incom- 
 petent, of herself, to weather each reef, and shoal, that 
 momentarily object their peril, in the cheerless navigation 
 of life. She had given her person to the monarch, but 
 not her affections to the man ; her heart would not blush 
 into love, and joy, at her father's bidding; she might 
 not,— she could not bestow it, where she felt it was legally

 due. But, alas ! that heart — that site of her latent ten- 
 derness, and frailty — which even now panted for liberty, 
 was not destined always to remain, the restless inmate of 
 its mistress' bosom : the hour is at hand, when the dreamy 
 vagueness of her wishes (" that craving void left aching 
 at the breast,") which hath troubled her so long, without 
 assuming any defined, or palpable shape, will converge its 
 whole strength, and concentrate all the deep mystery of 
 its source, into one burning focus of desire, and passion. 
 But the hidden springs of affection were, as yet, un- 
 touched ; and meanwhile, the mind of Isabella, required 
 some relaxation, from those unavailing suggestions of the 
 imagination, that sprung up within her, like weeds on a 
 neglected tomb. She was not sorry to be awakened, 
 from the delicious day-dreams, which besieged her on the 
 throne, crept in upon her banquets, and violated the leisure 
 of her solitude, without her having the power, or perhaps 
 always the inclination, " to call back her self-control." 
 Yes, she would rouse herself, and shake ofFher, like *' dew 
 from the lion's mane," the voluptuous languor, which ener- 
 vated her spirits, for want of the healthful stimulus, which 
 reciprocal, and gratified love should have supplied. This 
 disenchantment, she sought, by mingling in the rush, and 
 hurry of political intrigue, and by endeavouring to take an 
 interest, in the administration of affairs of state. 
 
 Herein she partially succeeded ; and none, in the pre- 
 dominating spirit of the Queen of Hungary, might dis- 
 cern the weakness of the woman, or penetrate the warm, 
 and wanton feelings, that lay locked up within her. — 
 " Femina de sexu mollis, sed corde virili.'"^' But in 
 thus disengaging herself, from the entanglements of a 
 too susceptible imagination, by calling into play, the 
 powers of a vigorous understanding, Isabella grew cal- 
 lous, and unfeeling. The bitter consciousness of her own 
 worn sensations, superinduced an indifference to the

 misfortunes of her fellow-creatures. She owned a malig- 
 nant pleasure, in wreaking- upon others, tlie accumulated 
 gall, which years of hackneyed splendour, and inward 
 agony, had generated. She first welcomed the toils of 
 ambition, in order to escape the meshes, with which her 
 spirit had previously struggled ; but, the exchange petri- 
 fied, or erased every blessed, and gentler feeling, instead 
 of meliorating her principles of action. Her sensibility, 
 which could not subside into indifference, hardened into 
 the Oripinv * of despotism. 
 
 The open and amiable girl, of a few years since, be- 
 came gradually transformed, by the force of circum- 
 stances, and by the strong, though invisible influence of 
 habit, into a violent, and inexorable being, — haughty in 
 command, inflexible to entreaty, and impenetrable in her 
 counsels. The fire of her ardent ungovernable tempera- 
 ment, flamed out in acts of authority, which bore down 
 all opposition. Yet, was Isabella gifted by nature, with 
 talents for command, of the very first order. Resolved 
 and uncompromising, if she owned little of the cool saga- 
 city, and comprehensive views, proper to the statesman; 
 she was assuredly possessed of a certain impracticability, 
 that knew not how to succumb, — a decision, that ad- 
 mitted of no temporising, or delay, — a tact, in anticipating 
 what were the projects of her opponents, — and an admir- 
 able wit, in devising the readiest mode to circumvent 
 them. 
 
 The impolitic division of the executive authority, in 
 consequence of the last testament of John, became, as 
 might have been predicted, the source of disunion be- 
 tween the parties. — " Two suns keep not their motion in 
 the same sphere." The jealousy of the supreme power, 
 was inflamed by the inevitable distinction of sex, and 
 the diversity, if not the opposition, of their characters; so 
 that their rivalship was exasperated, not only by mutual

 injuries, but, what was harder to be borne, by reciprocal 
 contempt. The cardinal despised Isabella, as a vain, and 
 opinionative woman, and was, in his turn, disdained by his 
 fair colleague, as a low-born, and hypocritical priest. — 
 Deux glaives ne pevvent Hre renfermes dans la meme 
 fourreau. — However, in the hour of difficulty, and danger, 
 Martinuzzi, gradually became lord of the ascendant.

 But, alas ! the temporary nature of Martinuzzi's power; 
 the obligations, which it entailed upon him, were over- 
 looked, in a bequest of such magnitude; and the slight 
 tenure, by which he, at first, held his synarchy, was im- 
 perceptibly consolidated, into the abstract right, sequent 
 upon long established possession. It may, however, 
 silence the detractors, from the fame of Martinuzzi, would 
 they bear in mind, that the fabric of the state was shat- 
 tered, and disjointed ; and that it required the strong, and 
 skilful hand of a master, to hold together the bonds of 
 national unity, and concord. 
 
 But Isabella never forgave the injuries she was obliged 
 patiently to endure, at the hands of her colleague; and 
 her resentment, perhaps, became the more rancorous, and 
 inveterate, in proportion as experience taught her the 
 necessity of temporishig. — '* Manet alta mente reposfa 
 injuria.''^- — Perhaps, the enjoyment of present compe- 
 tence, is incompatible with the remembrance of past 
 splendour. Be that as it may; regal honours, a stately 
 palace, a numerous retinue, all, that, Martinuzzi hoped, 
 might alleviate the chagrin of Isabella, served to exas- 
 perate, rather than appease, her secret sentiments of 
 enmity. The restlessness of her ambition was thinly im- 
 masked, by a tender concern for the succession, and by the

 specious pretence, which the natural anxiety of maternal 
 fondness readily afforded, so that it was not, until after 
 a long, and protracted struggle, that the lord regent 
 wrenched the truncheon, from the fist of his royal col- 
 league, and came to rule by his sole, and undisputed will. 
 In fine, however, the defeat of her general, Valentinian 
 Turascus, left her nothing, but the inane nomen* of her 
 high office, whilst the master-mind of Martinuzzi, soon 
 after, centered in himself the entire authority, attached 
 to the title. He assumed the right of exercising, without 
 appeal, the whole legislative, as well as the executive 
 functions; he usurped, from Isabella, the privilege of 
 coining money, f and imposing taxes, — his was, moreover, 
 the jurisdiction of life and death, of foreign alliance, and 
 domestic economy. 
 
 Still, even after the uncontrolled, and independent 
 sovereignty of the state was extorted, by the grasping 
 talents of the cardinal, and the natural, and resistless 
 claims of merit, and of violence, had superseded the 
 accidental, and ideal prerogative of birth, Isabella con- 
 trived, by gathering around her in opposition, many of 
 the native, and turbulent nobility, to thwart the views, 
 and vex the councils of the cardinal; and, by this 
 means, to set bounds to the fulness of his power. 
 
 It thus unfortunately happened, that to all the other 
 calamities, under which the country laboured, were 
 joined the gall, and bitterness of court intrigues, and 
 civil dissention. Yet, as respected the silent collision,

 cordiality prevailed, the more were the exterior demon- 
 strations of amity exhibited. On such occasions, the 
 conventional decorums of high rank, are seldom violated, 
 nor were the formal offices of friendship, suflfered to fall

 into desuetude, in the instance, under review. Whatever 
 might be their mutual consciousness, both Isabella, and 
 Martinuzzi, took care to cover their feelings towards each 
 other, with the polished surface of reciprocal respect. Ne- 
 vertheless, from the smiling ostentation of their courtesy, 
 its rankling rottenness came to be understood, although, 
 it was not permitted to be revealed.* The clashing of 
 interests, and the divisions, and subdivisions of faction, 
 superinduced upon the supposed rivalship of the two 
 supreme rulers of Hungary, it were at once needless, and 
 tedious to dilate upon. They belong to a loftier avoca- 
 tion than ours, and have no direct bearing upon the 
 present tale. 
 
 We may content ourselves briefly to notice, that, in 
 spite of the providence of Martinuzzi, the distraction of 
 the times paralysed the arm of government. It should 
 seem, that conspiracy, and rebellion stalked abroad, 
 like a giant at noon-day, naked and unchallenged. 
 Either by the solitary ruffian, or by bands of lawless 
 depredators, the wdiole country was spoiled, and laid 
 waste. Those aggressions on the public tranquillity, 
 which, considering the tumultuous disposition, familiar to 
 the nation, might have been little regarded, seemed to 
 become more serious, by being viewed, in connexion with 
 the ill-compacted frame of government, consequent on 
 the rivalship of the regents. In this state of affairs, the 
 bonds of civil life were burst asunder, whilst those fierce 
 haggards, the malignant passions, let loose upon society, 
 were hallooed on to their quarry, and, under pretence of 
 vindicating the cause of freedom, rapine, defloration, and 
 murder, became the animating spirits of the scene. The 
 household charities were invaded, — the wholesome ties of 
 kindred were loosened and snapped, — the ordinary inter- 
 courses of humanity were interrupted, no one knowing in 
 whom to confide,— the days of vassalage were gone, —

 the hereditary serf found himself enfranchised, without 
 an effort, and betrayed his lord to the vengeance of the 
 invader, — '* Corrupti dominos servi,"* and, (a circum- 
 stance, by the way, which tends to illustrate, still more 
 strongly, the factious spirit, and feverish excitement of 
 the public mind, incident to a minority. A clamour 
 was darkly propagated, which spared not even the 
 regent. The rumour went, that persons had been sub- 
 jected to the loss of liberty, and possibly of life, re- 
 specting whose practices, whether treasonable or inno- 
 cent, the lord cardinal could only have obtained cogni- 
 zance, through those emissaries, and spies, whom he 
 scrupled not to introduce, in the guise of ecclesiastics, 
 into the different monasteries, throughout Transylvania. 
 But Martinuzzi, by his zeal and piety, had acquired the 
 character of being a main pillar of the Catholic church, 
 and it is not easy to conceive, that he would forfeit that 
 high distinction, by permitting, for any secular ends, the 
 sacred seal of confession, to be violated. It was evident, 
 however, that he gained intelligence of all that passed 
 in the principality, with an apparent prescience, that 
 was inexplicable; but, whether it was merely a su- 
 perior system of espionage, which gifted him with his 
 colossal foreknowledge, is a question which cannot now 
 be satisfactorily answered, since history affords us no 
 clue, to unravel the mystery. At the time, however, 
 the public apprehensions were fortified, by the strong 
 suspicion, which the malignity of men's tongues failed 
 not to bruit abroad — that the confessor of Martinuzzi, 
 like a subservient fiend, had compelled the powers of 
 evil to work the will of himself, and his eminence, to the 
 utter discomfiture of their common enemies. It would 
 seem, however, incumbent on the historian, at this time 
 of day, to presume the innocence of Martinuzzi, in re- 
 gard to such a charge : the nice and secret springs of

 action, which impelled a high dignitary of the church, 
 and one, too, who, otherwise, was looked upon as an 
 amiable, and pious man, to retain so questionable a cha- 
 racter as Father Dominick, in so intimate a relation, 
 about his person, were involved in a cloud of suspicion, 
 and, since they might not be investigated, were peculiarly 
 obnoxious to the whispers of malevolence.* 
 
 In the meanwhile, the death-stroke of several mag- 
 nats, and independent chiefs, was accelerated by the axe 
 of the executioner, because, as was said, " their virtues 
 were incompatible with the rule of Martinuzzi." f — 
 " The Corinthian columns of society," were either 
 crumbled by the bolt, or scared by the flashes, of arbi- 
 trary power ; and the dungeons of the regent were 
 crowded with individuals, implicated in the late lawless 
 transactions. 
 
 It was one mornino;, durino; the time of terror, and 
 distrust, which we have commemorated in our last pages,. 
 that a cavalier, of mature years, clad in the knightly 
 vestments of the time, stood, for a brief space, before a 
 door of a small lodge, or turret, which flanked a stone 
 wall of great height, and considerable extent. He was 
 accompanied, or, perhaps, it were nearer the truth, to 
 say, attended, by a person, whose towering form, and 
 somewhat incongruous costume, doubtfully intimated 
 the lawless Olah, or roving chief of \yallachia. The 
 postern was opened, on a tap from the cavalier, and, 
 having passed within, the two found themselves in a sort 
 of park, or garden, seemingly private, beautifully ar- 
 ranged by art, and more beautifully broken by nature.

 It was refreshed by fountains, and by the silver wind- 
 ings of the river Zibin. The grounds shot down upon 
 the translucent waters, where they widened themselves 
 into an extensive basin. This was skirted, by some gi- 
 gantic trees, which, however few, sufficed to over-canopy 
 a small, clear fountain, that threw up a crystal column, 
 to the height of many feet, from a large jet, in the midst. 
 
 As the cavaliers walked leisurely on, in the direction of 
 the river, the elder, and apparently the more impor- 
 tant of the twain, addressed his companion, in words to 
 the following effect : — 
 
 "The purpose, of which we have lately spoke, must 
 now be opened to a person, whose interest is most deeply 
 involved in our success. Let me, however, understand : 
 thou remainest confident in thy opinion, that if the op- 
 portunity were afforded thee, by the permissive negli- 
 gence of his followers, and officers, in the day of battle, 
 thou couldst, with the aid of some of thy stout warhawks, 
 by one bold swoop, bear off the person of this man, in 
 the hour of his triumph, whither, matters not, provided 
 that the magnats of Hungary, and Transylvania, be never 
 more overborne, by his tyranny." 
 
 " I will pledge myself, as deeply as thou pleasest to 
 that point," replied the other chieftain ; '' and for this 
 substantial reason, as I told you before, that, previously 
 to your having instructed me in your wishes herein, and 
 applied for my aid, to carry them into effect, it was my 
 intention to adopt, from motives proper to myself, some- 
 thing like the line of proceeding, your policy would chalk 
 out for me. But, my Lord Balassi, I must make free 
 to inquire, who is this third party, you speak of ? Were 
 our enterprise, or rather mine, — for I shall be the active 
 instrument, — a mere undertaking for your single benefit, 
 you might initiate all the world into the secret, for aught 
 that I should demur ; but, since 'tis an affair, in which I 
 consider myself the party, I do not say, most endangered, 
 for I know not the meaning of the word, but most in-

 terested ; I do not choose to have the success of my 
 sanguine hopes^ which soar on steady wing, beyond the 
 utmost stretch of thy imagination, risked by any rash 
 confidence of thine. Tell me, then, at once, who is this 
 person ? or I go back as I came, and you may forget, 
 we ever discussed the subject." 
 
 "Content thee, friend," replied Balassi, "she is one, 
 who, whatever benefits may accrue to thee, and thy peo- 
 ple, by the holding this man in bondage, will find herself 
 a hundred-fold more advantaged. 'Tis true, there is a re- 
 ward, e'en now, advertised for thy head, which will be taken 
 off, — not thy head, man, but its price — so thou needest 
 not gloom so terribly ; but the personage to whom I 
 allude, is concerned herein, more than the paltry pre- 
 servation of life, and infinitely more than is compre- 
 hended in the mere gratification of a whole race of 
 Egyptian pilgrim^.. Every mmute of her existence is 
 held in a state of thraldom, and one pa'^g of her heart, 
 in this regard, outweighs incalculably, the pains of a 
 whole life of ordinary mortals. But why should I dis- 
 course to thee of such high matter, which exceedeth thy 
 understanding ?" 
 
 " Why should you, indeed, my lord ? I am not a man 
 to agitate my wits, with what is not directly conducive 
 to my proper good : ' Ne sutor ultra crepidam,' hath 
 ever been my rule." 
 
 " Well, friend," said Balassi, " your Cygani, or Wal- 
 lachian Patois, which ever it be, is not now the thing 
 needed ; the lady, to whom I shall presently introduce 
 you — " 
 
 " A lady, forsooth!" interrupted the other; "a most 
 rare depositary for a secret ! But since it happens, I can 
 give a guess, who is that lady." And he cast around a 
 cursory, but significant look, on the highly-decorated 
 grounds, they were slowly measuring. " I will not start 
 any objection on that score." 
 
 *' 'Twere as well you do not," replied Balassi, haugh-

 tily ; " but to return to what we were saying. Have you 
 these cletermhied set of heroes, you boasted of erewhiles, 
 planted on the spot, ready to act ?" 
 
 " Unquestionably, have I," answered the other. ''They 
 crouch, as little dreamt of, near Coloswar, as any troop of 
 wolves, under their coverlet of snow, what time their scent 
 is up, and appetence keen, and the sun goes down on 
 the human spoil, with which Carnage hath sated his bro- 
 ther Death, and they rouse them, from their long slum- 
 ber, to discuss their prepared quarry." 
 
 " Yes," said Balassi, musing; " Coloswar is likely to 
 be the point of attack, and, if I err not, the neighbour- 
 hood of that city must become the arena of a bloody 
 struggle, one of these days. Towards the gates, the im- 
 perial force directs its march, doubtless allured by the 
 regalia of Hungary, which is deposited within the for- 
 tress, and there will Martinuzzi be compelled to contest 
 that sovereignty, which he would not voluntarily forego ; 
 nor would I, God be my v.itness! willingly see the crown 
 of St. Stephen light on the head of Ferdinand." 
 
 " You may take my warrant for it, my lord, it never 
 shall," said the other, with a peculiar expression, which, 
 \)eing remarked by Balassi, afterwards occurred to him 
 as singular, although, at the moment, it made small im- 
 pression on him. 
 
 *' The genius of Martinuzzi is my best surety," said 
 the count, after a short pause, " that such a fatal stab 
 to the independence of fair Erdely will be warded off in 
 time. Prior to the utter defeat of the invader, you will 
 not be required to act : understand, sir, not against Bap- 
 tista Castaldo, Marquis of Piadena, will you waste your 
 strength ; but, on the overthrow of that general, you 
 will spread your snares around the victor, George, cardi- 
 nal, and regent of Hungary." 
 
 " Be assured, at all events, I will not drain my re- 
 sources," said the other; "my object is, first, the dis- 
 comfiture of the Austrians ; and then, by shackling the

 usurper, to clear the way for the universal acknowledg- 
 ment of the rightful queen of Hungary." 
 
 ''Nay, friend," observed Balassi ; "I should rather 
 suppose, your inducements to this business lie elsewhere ; 
 certain privileges to be conceded to thy people, for in- 
 stance." 
 
 " It may be so," said the other, in a tone of indiffer- 
 ence, '' or, if not, we need not now confer about terms. 
 You have your motives ; I have mine ; which are soundest, 
 time will discover; and so that our common point be 
 gained, it does not much matter, either way. But, mv 
 lord, though the moments of both of us may amount, in the 
 end, to the same sum of time, mycares are more multitudin- 
 ous than yours, and I cannot afford to lavish the precious 
 fugitives, with the like thoughtlessness. My every minute 
 is tasked to the uttermost. I have attended you so far, 
 at your request. 'Tis treason to ourselves, since the lady, 
 you spoke of, is not visible, to dally longer. Even were 
 she present, I know of no inspiring argument, which she 
 could use, in favour of this adventure, one half so power- 
 ful, as I have already whispered to my secret soul." 
 
 " Why, surely," said Balassi, " it would pleasure thee 
 to know, from authority, that thou wert engaged in a loyal 
 deed, were it only, as a set-off to certain transactions of a 
 clear contrary description." 
 
 " The thought I meditate," said the other, '' I care not 
 what men call ; they can't, I trust, but have to say, it 
 succeeded, and success is every thing." 
 
 "Then this gallant gentleman is most confident in his 
 ability, and means, to achieve this mighty enterprise," 
 said a soft, and strange voice, close at hand ; and the 
 same miniite, a female, splendidly arrayed, stepped forth, 
 over the threshold of a low, rustic summer-house, near 
 which they stood, and gracefully saluted Count Balassi. 
 Both cavaliers uncovered their heads ; the one, of his light 
 calpac, and Balassi, of his open helmet, or morion ; for

 they had no difficulty, in immediately recognising Queen 
 Isabella. 
 
 The same causes, which had insensibly inclined the dis- 
 position of the lady, from its original bent, had gradually 
 left their proper traces, on her countenance. Still, what 
 had once been the peculiar cast of her mind, might be 
 gathered, from an attentive perusal of her features : for 
 the physiognomy of qualities, which are indigenous (so to 
 speak) to the individual, can never be entirely suppressed, 
 however the discipline of time, and habit, may insensibly 
 disguise, or partially obscure, its primary expression. 
 Her stature was of a height, which rose to the majestic, 
 and corresponded with her station, and royal habitudes. 
 She looked " every inch a queen." Dignity, and com- 
 mand sat enthroned on her front, as on a pedestal ; her 
 dark hazel eyes, overarched by the gracefully-pencilled 
 eyebrows, whilst they flashed with disdain, exultation, or 
 reproof, confessed her born for empire ; but, ah ! in soli- 
 tude, or when indeed she learned to love, " her life 
 seemed melting through those looks," and the thirsty air 
 might quaiF whole draughts of liquid light, instinct with 
 all the soft, and luxuriant sensibility of her temperament, 
 and sparkling, like so many drops of soul, with the pas- 
 sion, which consumed her. Indeed, the dark hollows, 
 round about those orbs, seemed, to use the figure of the 
 poet, the very mark for Cupid's archery, * Her profuse, 
 and glossy ringlets rivalled, in darkness, the raven's 
 plume ; the form of her head was simple, and dignified, 
 and the lines of her ample forehead, denoted her inflexi- 
 bility of purpose. The outline of her face presented an 
 oval, whose noble regularity, viewed in profile, might 
 once have interested, from its romantic, and melancholy 
 character; but, if so, the hand of time had nearly effaced 
 that expression, and chiselled, in its place, the contour of

 regality, and pride. Her mouth was beautiful, and femi- 
 nine, although the ripeness of the upper lip, slightly 
 swollen, as if newly stung, (perhaps an outward, and 
 visible indication, of what had been her abstract, sensual 
 propensities, in her inexperienced girlhood), had settled 
 into the habitual curl of haughtiness, and disdain. With- 
 in, gleamed two rows of polished ivory. The swan might 
 have been proud to display so stately, and graceful a 
 neck, as uprose, in just, and admirable undulation, from 
 the firm, and developed bust, and broad, dazzling shoul- 
 ders of Isabella. 
 
 Such was the queen of Hungary, when we introduce 
 her to our readers, and to the Graf Balassi. The count, 
 to whom she had addressed herself, was the first to speak. 
 
 " I have waited upon you, madam, at this hour, ac- 
 cording to your wishes, expressed at our last interview, 
 and have thought it advisable, that you should yourself 
 converse with the famous leader, whom I named to you, 
 and whose arm is destined to rid your higliness, and the 
 country of that domineering priest, you wot of. I have, 
 therefore, your grace, brought him hither with rae, and 
 this person, standing before you, is the man." 
 
 " Now, as ever, you have acted rightly, my lord Ba- 
 lassi," said Isabella ; '' and you have my thanks. I need 
 not inquire, friend," she continued, shooting a glance at 
 Balassi's companion, by a turn of the eye, without, how- 
 ever, altering her position, " respecting your appetency 
 for the glorious work, in which we would wish to employ 
 thy energies, for I have heard much of what thou hast 
 just spoken ; I will ask, rather, that, which is more be- 
 coming of our station, and agreeable to our disposition to 
 ascertain, namely, in what way we can best recompense, 
 so enterprising a coadjutor?" 
 
 The person, thus addressed, stood with head erect, and 
 a firm countenance. " Madam," he replied, " I mean no 
 disrespect, when I assure you, that it were to tax your 
 bounty, infinitely beyond the means of your exchequer.

 v,'ere I to name a recompence — one half so mighty, as I 
 propose to myself, in achieving this adventure ; and 
 that, without any reference to your grace's largesses, I 
 seek nought of you, but your influence with your nobles, 
 to afford me that opportunity, 1 thirst for, quite as much 
 as can your highness, and, perhaps, with greater reason." 
 
 Isabella was probably mortified, to think, that the ut- 
 most extent of her proffered liberality should be rejected, 
 in such unqualified terms ; it was, therefore, with a con- 
 siderable degree of hauteur, that, after scrutinizing, for a 
 moment, his daring cast of countenance, she demanded of 
 the count, whether his companion was not connected 
 with the people, called Cyganis ? 
 
 " I am their leader, madam," said the person in ques- 
 tion, stopping the reply, that was on the lip of Balassi. 
 
 " And your name, sir; or title, if you have any ?" 
 
 " I am count, by virtue of my office," answered the 
 other; " and, in the world, commonly go by the style of 
 Count Ragotzy, for it is convenient, sometimes," he con- 
 tinued, with a meaning smile, '' to sink the name, Alaric 
 Polgar, which is properly mine, by birth and parentage. 
 Such, hitherto, have been my distinctive appellations: 
 what they may become hereafter, depends very much, on 
 the issue of that event, which shall shortly fill the ears of 
 Hungary, but which is yet, in the womb of time." 
 
 " How, say'st thou?" said Isabella, and her look seemed 
 to rest, with scorn, on the Cygani; "dost seek to exalt 
 thee, by adding to thy titles? Thou would'st have had 
 me believe, I ween, not a minute gone by, I had no boon, 
 ample enough, to requite a brave officer like thee. What 
 rank, — what new appellation, — what distinction, dost thou 
 covet? Only state thy wish, that, with a word, I might 
 transmute thy hope to certainty, or at least, to what is 
 little less than such, being contingent^ on the success of 
 thy daring, in this emprise." 
 
 " Why, 'faith, madam," said Ragotzy, " I have only 
 to repeat, I am not moved to the matter, by any hope of

 your highness's patronage, or favour. I am here, acting 
 from my own impulses : when you see, how far my course 
 correspondeth with your highness's views, it will be then 
 time enough, to talk of rewards and honours; but ere I 
 humbly take my leave," he continued, disregardful of 
 the angry spot, that loured on the imperial brow of Isa- 
 bella, — " I would request this lord," turning to Balassi, 
 " to inform me, who are committed wnth him, in this con- 
 spiracy, and, by what token, 1 am to distinguish his con- 
 federates, so that I might make some distinction, between 
 friends and foes, in the onslaught, which is likely to 
 ensue; for I apprehend, that Martinuzzi will sell his 
 liberty, and certain of his body- guard their lives, pretty 
 dearly." 
 
 " Why, I believe," replied Balassi ; '' you must, e'en, 
 in a great measure, trust to your sagacity, on the instant. 
 The conduct of any particular chief, under the circum- 
 stances, will be the best badge. Any other, ^vere dan- 
 gerous; nay, it were obviously impossible, in certain in- 
 stances, to adopt any common and distinguishing mark, 
 and it were only to lead you into error, to assume such, 
 partially. The lords, Maylat, Nadastis, and such as they, 
 need hoist no colours to exhibit their hostility to Marti- 
 nuzzi. Their deeds will manifest their party. Others, 
 like Count Turascus, and old John BanfFy, though we 
 dare not lay open our conspiracy to them, have, we 
 know, their hands on their swords' hilt, and the war-cry, 
 " Czerina" on their lip ; and, trust me, the word will be 
 pronounced, and a blow struck at the same moment, that 
 they think they discover, the slightest waning of the star 
 of Martinuzzi. Then will they bring to our aid, all the 
 force of their vassals, and, what is of more importance, 
 all the authority of their character. But you v.ill be 
 initiated, particularly herein, by Mirce, whom you will 
 see at Coloswar, and unto whom your grace, if I under- 
 stood right," he added, addressing the queen, " meant 
 to transmit certain missives."

 " You will oblige me, sir, by undertaking their charge," 
 said Isabella, in a grave tone of voice, and with a manner, 
 even more formal, than she had hitherto adopted. Then, 
 addressing herself to Balassi, she said, in a freer voice, 
 while her countenance shone, with a smile of anticipated 
 revenge: 
 
 " It happens, most fortunately for our views, my lord, 
 my having gained my point, with the cardinal, in regard 
 to that truly attached, and faithful follower of mine, being 
 appointed to the office of castellan, in Coloswar. Pre- 
 vious to the strange evanishment of Count Oldimar, both 
 the governors were the cardinal's creatures: now, thank 
 Heavens ! in Mirce, I command a most devoted adherent, 
 on the very spot, where his services promise to be in- 
 valuable. Then, again," speaking to Ragotzy, who had 
 turned his head aside, during these last words, she said, — 
 " You are too little used to the decorums of a court, sir 
 count, to hide your feelings : I, however, pardon your 
 impatience, and will not detain you an instant, after 
 consigning these trifling despatches to your especial 
 care. Deliver them into Mirce's hands ; they contain 
 directions for his conduct, and information, which he, and 
 all my friends, may find of use; moreover, I have not 
 forgotten to commend the interests of the bearer to his 
 excellency." She paused, and the haughty curl of her 
 lip seemed to increase, as she added; " adieu, sir count, 
 till we meet again; when, please God! and your sword 
 be true, we shall be in a position, to treat with you, as 
 becomes a crowned queen. — My Lord Balassi, I look to 
 see you once more, ere you leave Hermanstadt for your 
 patrimonial hermitage. Gentlemen, both, your obedient!" 
 — And Isabella, after acknowledging the reverence of the 
 chieftains, with graceful, though somewhat haughty 
 courtesy, turned in another direction, and followed one 
 of the intersecting walks, which appeared to lead to a re- 
 mote quarter of the gardens.

 gotzy, " I shall be glad to hear, my Lord Balassi, your 
 reasons, for mixing her greatness up, with the matter in 
 hand. Were I less urged on by private motives, than I 
 am, her carriage is not exactly calculated, to give one a 
 zest for the undertaking." 
 
 " To say truth, friend," answered Balassi, " I myself, 
 as to individual taste, entertain no uncommon good-will, 
 for that haughty dowager. I ever held John of Zapola, 
 since he joined in wedlock with her grace, no friend to the 
 rights, and privileges of the nobility; and I, and Maylat, 
 (the man I mean, who is now held a prisoner by Solyman, 
 the father of the young nobleman, who is joined with us, 
 in the present enterprise), and certain other indignant 
 spirits, were, in fact, up in arms, on divers points of dif- 
 ference, when King John gave up the ghost, but that 
 grudge is long over ; and verily, after all, what were the 
 fasces of the late king's authority, in comparison, w^ith the 
 rods of iron, with which the usurping regent scourges the 
 native aristocracy? Isabella is confederated, at this day, 
 with the magnats of Hungary, simply because common 
 injuries have wrought out old causes of mutual distrust. 
 I make no doubt, she anticipates ruling over the country, 
 as perfectly in contempt of us, the people,* as ever she 
 was used to do, by means of her ascendancy, over her 
 doating husband. She may find herself mistaken. The 
 principal magnates dread her imperious temper, and in 
 any event, will hardly enlarge her authority. They will 
 ascertain their true interest, no less than perform a para- 
 mount duty, in supporting the Lady Czerina, in all her 
 just prerogatives, on the throne of her father. She is a 
 mere child, and might be easily moulded to our will ; 
 whilst her mother, as innately a tyrant as Martinuzzi 
 himself, would be as little inclined, as is that stern 
 prelate, to pay court to the nobility. But at present,

 from our connexion with the widow of King John, we 
 derive a considerable accession of influence, and reputation; 
 and as neither party commit themselves, by throwing a 
 light on their future intentions, the removal of Martinuzzi, 
 will leave the path open on all sides." 
 
 Ragotzy paused for a moment, and then replied; " I 
 will deal plainly with you, my Lord Balassi," he said : 
 *' the other night, long after the deep mid-hour had 
 tolled, I chanced to be in a retired aisle of the church of 
 St. Theresa. Whether the enacting, or the confession of 
 a deed of sin, recommended so remarkable a sojourn, 
 matters not. Let it suffice, that, then, and there, T heard 
 with my own ears, yon lady, so proud in seeming, pour forth, 
 in no measured terms, her passionate love, for a youthful 
 cavalier, whom she joined, in the church, most probably 
 by assignation. That paramour," continued Ragotzy, 
 having observed, after a pause, that Balassi was silent 
 from astonishment, — '•'• for the words of Isabella implied 
 his being no less to her — that paramour was Antoine 
 Ferraro, the secretary to the Austrian legation, in this 
 city." 
 
 Balassi started, and showed no small symptoms of 
 surprise. " Just Heavens! is it credible?" he exclaimed. 
 
 *' Hardly so," replied Ragotzy; "but, nevertheless, 
 most veritable."* 
 
 " Did he court her?" 
 
 " Rather, she courted him, plead, sued to him." 
 
 " How? — affectionately?" 
 
 *' No; servilely, — 1 may say, basely." 
 
 *' What! that scornful dame?" 
 
 "Scornful, my lord! — Pish, pish! Methinks, at your 
 years, you should better understand woman's nature.

 witnessed, I am right in considering her highness, no very 
 safe accession to our confederacy." 
 
 " Antoine Ferraro !" ejaculated Balassi. 
 '' Even he," replied Ragotzy; " and, holding the 
 office he does, he is the very man, whose cognizance of 
 our plot, we have most cause to deprecate." 
 
 " Isabella! — she, whose pride was glorious, — to stoop 
 to such an abject lowness, as to sue a lover! To fall so 
 far beneath her proper self! — But, enough, — she will 
 never, surely, reveal to the Austrian, our scheme to free 
 the country from Martinuzzi's domination." Thus Balassi 
 pondered with himself, musing audibly. 
 
 '^ Possibly not," answered Ragotzy: "but the integ- 
 rity of the head, where love's frailty riots in the heart, 
 is not worth much. A seductive word will get at secrets 
 sooner than the torture. However, if danger there be, 
 'tis already incurred, and for myself, my plans are hardly 
 so bound up in yours, as to make it a circumstance 
 worthy any regard ; or else, by the God in heaven ! the 
 minion's intrigue with Isabella, should prove his last 
 offering to the devil, whether j9ar amours, or otherwise." 
 *^ Well," said Balassi, Vv-e must only hope for the best ; 
 'tis singular, however, the choice her highness has made. 
 I have heard it whispered, that this young secretary has 
 been selected, by Martinuzzi, for the bridegroom of the 
 Lady Czerina." 
 
 "Surely you err," said Ragotzy; "the rumour ran, 
 the regent's nephew was to be turned into a king, by 
 the conjuration of this royal maiden's bed." 
 
 " Why, in truth, such a match were not so bad. The 
 son of my ancient friend, Pereny, would scarcely seem 
 an unmeet mate, even for the queen of Hungary," re- 
 turned Balassi ; " but his folly, after wearying the whole 
 kingdom, hath worn out the patience, even of his uncle. 
 However, here we enter the more frequented walks of the 
 gardens, and it were better separate. Farewell ; you 
 will not fail to take advantage of any disaffection, among

 the populace, in the towns, through which you travel, to 
 embarrass the regent's government still further, by raising 
 their minds to mutiny, and rebellion." 
 
 " I will exert my modicum of ability that way, you 
 may rest assured, and hope to set to work, ere I leave 
 Hermanstadt," answered Ragotzy. After reciprocal ex- 
 pressions of courteous regard, which, as it happened, 
 might mean every thing or nothing. Count Balassi and 
 the Cygani leader, made signs of leave-taking, and se- 
 parated. 
 
 Suppose we accompany them, for a few paces, on their 
 way, just to discover the nature of their cogitations. 
 
 *' I penetrate that daring miscreant's politics," said 
 the magnat, internally. " I see his drift : he thinks to 
 make himself so useful, as to be indispensable ; and then, 
 forsooth, these Cygani people must have granted them 
 an equality of privileges, with the Magyari ; but once, 
 by his means, let the nobles of Hungary get the upper 
 hand, and Count Ragotzy — Count ! ha ! ha ! ha ! — shall 
 be arraigned, on many a bloody question. This precious 
 race of vagrants shall be rooted out of the land ; the 
 charter, they lay such stress upon, shall be abrogated; 
 and the leader, they take such pride in, shall feel the 
 headsman's axe." 
 
 " Proud, despicable noble !" thought Count Ragotzy, 
 in his secret soul, '' I had difficulty to forbear thee so long. 
 My gorge rose so, at thy arrogant bearing, that thy life 
 was jeopardised, more than once, as we held speech toge- 
 ther. And, thinkest thou, if Hungaria's weal moved me 
 to this deed, that 1 would strip the purple off a single 
 tyrant, (even were Martinuzzi such), and cast it among 
 a hundred meaner despots, to divide into so many shreds 
 and patches, as a type, at once, and an authority, for 
 their several usurpations ? No ! for the happiness, and 
 independence of the state, (with the exception of some 
 score or two of factious grafs, like this Balassi), what 
 rule could be better fitted, than that of Martinuzzi? Not

 for thy benefit, misproud lord, nor that of thy overbear- 
 ing order, did I conceive the noble enterprise, which I 
 hope to carry into execution ; but because, as thou thy- 
 self saidst, in thine ignorance, the removal of Marti- 
 nuzzi will leave the path open, on all sides. Yes, thou 
 art right: the young queen must then be acknowledged, 
 and her husband v/ill be thy lord and master, my mighty 
 magnat. Ay, Alaric Polgar will be the king of Hun- 
 gary." 
 
 While raising these impalpable edifices, in the airy fu- 
 ture, Ragotzy was so totally abstracted, from the more 
 substantial interests of the present moment, that he was 
 not a little startled, to find his visionary contemplations 
 had carried him, right into the midst of a group of per- 
 sons, assembled in the gardens of the palace. 
 
 These people were remarking, with no small marvel, a 
 young cavalier of noble mien, and gallant bearing, who, 
 with his arms folded across his breast, paced the margin 
 of the river Zibin, beneath a grove of tall cypresses, that 
 spired up, and glanced their foliage, in the glare, and fer- 
 vour of the noon-day sun, like so many restless emeralds. 
 The individual, in question, stopped, ever and anon, and 
 then again walked pensively forward, as if his slow, and 
 funereal tread was unconsciously keeping time, with the 
 sullen current of his disturbed reflection. So conspicu- 
 ously handsome was this man, and possessed of a physi- 
 ognomy so remarkable, that, once beheld, his inefface- 
 able image would dwell in the memory for years, alike 
 haunting the cheerful companioned day, and rising, like 
 an unburied ghost, amid the visions of night. Though 
 slightly built, and with a stature, hardly exceeding the 
 middle height of man, his frame was sinewy, and agile. 
 His features were well formed, and delicately chiselled, 
 yet tinged to almost an Ethiopian hue. His mouth was 
 compressed, as if by some strong internal effort, and small 
 mustaches shaded the upper lip. His dark locks adjusted 
 themselves to the shape of the head, which they enveloped.

 excepting where, here and there, the short, close spiral 
 of crisped curls elongated itself, about the nape of a throat, 
 whose marble whiteness, the embroidered shirt-collar 
 being thrown back, discovered to view. His small- tressed 
 head, was most gracefully set upon his shoulders. His 
 forehead was high, and full, and the somewhat oval cheek 
 was exquisitely rounded, towards the chin. His eyebrows 
 were large, and prominent, and from beneath their shadow, 
 his black eyes glazed out with almost preternatural lustre, 
 like two orbs of fire, whose expression, it were beyond the 
 power of language to picture, being, at once, so intoler- 
 ably fierce, and so exquisitely tender. This contrariety 
 could hardly be exhibited, in one, and the same glance : 
 but the alternation appeared so sudden, and instantaneous, 
 as to produce, on the beholder, the effect of unity. 
 Partly owing to this mutable expression, and partly to 
 the undefined, though powerful character of his whole 
 aspect, the individual, of whom we speak, was one, who, 
 seen but for a minute, left an impression, which even the 
 operation of time, might scarcely efface. The smile, so 
 soft, and sunny, and that terrific frown, seemingly woven, 
 like light and darkness, in the same countenance, were 
 remembered, and spoken of, by the passenger, long after 
 he had encountered them : 
 
 " He would awaken at night, 
 With the dream of those ghastly eyes." * 
 
 White-budding maidens, at their mother's door, would 
 tremble, as he passed, and follow him, with straining gaze, 
 and a "pleasing fear,"t till he v/as out of sight; then, 
 laying their hands on their fluttering bosoms, would sigh 
 at thoughts, they dared not analyze, yet guessed not 
 wherefore. Little children would stop short, in the 
 midst of their gambols, to contemplate the stranger, with 
 wonder, and instinctive awe ; and the fell assassin him- 
 self, would turn aside, in his midnight track, startled

 and appalled, as at a visage, more ominous than his own. 
 This individual was habited, according to the splendid, 
 and picturesque costume of Spain, then much affected, 
 by the cavaliers of the empire. His jubon fitted close 
 to the body, and was composed of claret cloth; appended 
 to this doublet were cuisses, or short skirts of white satin. 
 Over this dress, he wore a light velvet mantle, of the co- 
 lour of claret. His hat was embroidered round the crowm, 
 and brim, and looped up with pearls. Every article of 
 this attire, was most lavishly passamented. Still, though 
 a fastidious eye might detect some points, too richly over- 
 laid, (which few, who remarked, how admirably his fine 
 person became his " prodigal embroideries," * would 
 care to object), the over-abundant costliness must fairly 
 be ascribed to the bias of the times, and not to any error, 
 in the taste of the wearer. His age could not exceed 
 one-and-twenty, and might be, under that period. Such 
 was Marc Antoine Ferraro, secretary to Castaldo, Mar- 
 quis of Piadena, the accredited ambassador, from Ferdi- 
 nand of Austria, to the court of Hermanstadt. For 
 above an hour, this individual traversed the grand lawn, 
 fronting the palace, regardless of the passers by, to 
 whom he soon became an object of no inconsiderable 
 marvel ; nor did he appear to be aware, that his wild 
 and abstracted deportment, had attracted the attention 
 of more than one knot of gazers, who were now drawn to- 
 gether, busying themselves, in eyeing the young secretarv, 
 with all due regard, to keeping their own distance. 
 
 "Holy Mary!" ejaculated a passenger, a middle- 
 aged dame, as she flagged her steps, near one of those 
 straggling coteries: "Holy Mary! did ever Christian 
 see the like ? The young gentleman is lunatic ; yet 
 mark how gallantly he looks it, with his tags, and 
 embroidery. How pale, too! — and what a smile ! — as 
 from an angel."

 '^An angel ! Ay, forsooth ! — an angel in limbo, me- 
 thinks;" interposed a mendicant friar, in a half-whisper, 
 " or an angel, whose whereabouts shall be nameless; the 
 blessed Virgin save us ! I never before encountered such 
 a savage look, and care not, to meet it again ; but he is 
 certainly crazed." 
 
 '' Nay, my good father," put in the first speaker, 
 " he's a proper lad, I maintain, only a little too dressy 
 like; — but he'll know better, mayhap, as his beard 
 thickens." 
 
 *' Does any here know him ? " inquired the friar. 
 
 " I'll warrant him, by the texture of his tissue," re- 
 marked a soldier, disabled in the late wars, "to be an 
 Austrian ; the sons of the Magyari, in our evil days, can- 
 not afford such furbelows." 
 
 " Thou speakest sooth, comrade," exclaimed another 
 voice, loudly, in the ear of the disbanded veteran ; he 
 turned, — a new comer had been added to the assembly. 
 '^ Thou speakest sooth, I say." 
 
 "Why, ay,'' returned the soldier, " I'll be bound he is 
 enrolled in the regent's mercenary band. A murrain 
 seize the outlandish mannikin, nemet ember, nem em- 
 ber,* is a true saying, I see. What have we to do with 
 a parcel of barbarian foreigners, I should like to know ? 
 It shows distrust in Martinuzzi." 
 
 " Why, sir, the kingdom's his," rejoined the new 
 comer ; " your lands, and chattels, nay, your very lives, 
 are vassals to his pleasure. He had better have a care, 
 however, of the storm, which hath still been gathering, 
 and which now mutters its thunder, from yonder distant 
 hills. There is an impulse working, for his ruin, will 
 make itself triumphant. Behold ye it not ? — hear ye it 
 not? Already nation answers nation; and,lo! from 
 many a deep, and hollow thoroughfare, the sound re- 
 verberates. It rushes hither, from Stamboul, — from Vi-

 said I not well, friends ?" 
 
 The little knot of citizens drew back in a body, per- 
 fectly at a loss to comprehend, how any man could be 
 so foolhardy, as to give utterance, to such language, at 
 noon-day, in Hermanstadt. The individual, who excited 
 this astonishment, was tall, and of majestic mien, but his 
 person was carefully enveloped, in a motley sheep-skin 
 cloak ; such as the richters, or chiefs of the neighbouring 
 province of Wallachia, were accustomed to wrap about 
 them. It was decorated, on the outside, with patches of 
 leather, of divers sizes, and colours, and was faced, with 
 fur of no ordinary price. The cape was of the finest 
 wool, and was drawn so closely round the under part of 
 the face, that it suggested the idea, of being intended for 
 a disguise. If this was really the case, the object was 
 not altogether attained, for the few points of his cos- 
 tume, which his muster-piece did not hide, betrayed an 
 incongruity, that could not easily escape notice. He had 
 on his head the kalpac, or Hungarian national cap, with 
 a projecting front of black lambskin, which slouched, in 
 an enormous shade, over his face, and was surmounted, 
 by a small peacock's feather. In his left hand, he held 
 the chakan, or bludgeon, of considerable thickness. So 
 far, there was nothing remarkable ; but the minutise, we 
 have described, were utterly out of keeping, with the 
 cshizmas, or open boots, of the finest chamois leather, that 
 graced his legs, and with the massive golden spurs, there- 
 unto attached ; which singular, and ill-assorted union, 
 indeed, seemed to give the lie direct, to his other accou- 
 trements. 
 
 " I tell ye," continued this personage, with animation, 
 whilst many of his auditors, not being ambitious of his 
 lecture, or, perhaps, not caring to render themselves 
 amenable to the arm of power, had either slunk away, 
 one by one, in confusion, and remained loitering, at a 
 short distance, or had fied the gardens entirely — ' sic

 est mox vulgus' — " I tell ye, the avalanche is suspended, 
 by a film, more subtle than gossamer — a breath disparts 
 it, and the inundation is complete." 
 
 "Ay, ay," exclaimed the soldier, " it will shower down, 
 on the city, one of these days, I'll warrant ! St. Stephen 
 be our protection ! since, for my part, I see no other." 
 
 *' There needs none," resumed the former, hotly ; 
 " neither devil, nor saint can aid ye ; but you need nei- 
 ther." 
 
 The diminished crowd broke, into still smaller groups, 
 as a low cry of terror was heard, in the direction of the 
 palace. The orator, meanwhile, without heeding it, 
 went on, in a louder tone. 
 
 "The close and stagnant air of disease, and putrefac- 
 tion can only be rendered wholesome, by the hurricane. 
 Tyranny may be borne for a strange term, but even ty- 
 ranny hath its allotted period." 
 
 "The black! — the black! — the familiar of Father 
 Dominick !" exclaimed some one with wild affright. And 
 the next moment, several voices cried out, " If he be not 
 coming towards us ! — Look, there he is ! — Holy Mary 
 save us ! — The black ! the black !" 
 
 Our radical friend, not the less proceeded — 
 
 " I tell ye, countrymen" — but his information was ne- 
 cessarily stopped short, by the total dispersion of his au- 
 dience, in all directions, like so many globules of quick- 
 silver, at a touch. 
 
 As he pronounced these last words, in something of an 
 exalted tone, he was surprised, to feel a heavy hand laid 
 upon his shoulder. Reverting his head, his looks fell, on 
 the dark visage of Scipio, the attendant of the dreaded 
 Father Dominick. Obeying the sudden, and fierce im- 
 pulse of the instant, the knight, involuntarily, cast his 
 hand under his muster-piece, and, from thence, half drew 
 forth a brilliant two-handed sword ; but, observing a 
 gathering crowd, at no great distance, he recollected him- 
 self, and, almost directly, resheathed it. The movement

 was not, however, so quickly executed, but that the 
 weapon attracted the eyes of Scipio, in whom the deepest 
 excitation seemed to be suddenly produced by the sight. 
 
 " How came you by that ?" he demanded, in an impe- 
 tuous, and agitated voice. 
 
 The other, wrapping the cape of his mantle closer 
 around the under part of his face, and pulling down his 
 kalpac, so low over his brows, as to cast his eyes into 
 shadow, answered, in a tone, which was intended to ap- 
 pear cool, and indifferent. " What's that to you, my 
 sable questioner ?" With these words, he brushed by his 
 companion, and passed forward, at a quick pace. 
 
 The black instantly followed, and, coming up with 
 him, the two men strode silently, side by side. For above 
 a minute, the Ethiop sternly scanned him of the muster- 
 piece. He again spoke, — " 1 have found, then, the mur- 
 derer at last, and in thee !" 
 
 " I understand you not," replied the stranger, with ap- 
 parent unconcern, and without stopping, or turning his 
 head. 
 
 " Well, it skills not wasting words," rejoined the 
 black. " You are now in the city, on Father Dominick's 
 warrant of safe conduct, and it may not consist with his 
 policy to break it; nevertheless, after this notice, if 
 straightwise thou quittest not Hermanstadt, I will my- 
 self denounce thee to the tribunal of justice ! — Avaunt 
 thee, homicide !" 
 
 "Thou art under some delusion, friend; I assure you," 
 answered the stranger; "we never met before in our lives; 
 and, on such a point," he subjoined, scoffingly, " I suspect, 
 I am likely to be the better judge : you know me not." 
 
 " A word in your ear," said the African. He drew 
 cautiously nearer ; and, remote as they were from observa- 
 tion, sunk his voice into a whisper, as he added, " we en- 
 countered on the night of the murder of Count Rodna." 
 
 The stranger half stopped short, and thrust his hand 
 within his mantle-piece. " 'Tis false !" he said, faintly. 
 ' Thou wast not present, — nor I."

 ** Whose spear is that, by thy side ?" interrupted Scipio, 
 again fixing on him along, piercing look. ''The good old 
 man who once owned it, shall yet be avenged ; but you 
 may now depart." Having uttered this command, he 
 abruptly halted beside a ruinous porchway, which, in 
 other times, was the entrance of the royal palace, but 
 of late years had been suffered to grow dilapidated. 
 The other made a pause also. 
 
 " Do you hear?" repeated the African, in a louder 
 and authoritative tone, motioning him away, with a high, 
 and haughty sweep of his arm: " I would be alone." 
 
 The other hesitated, looked around him, for an in- 
 stant, and then said, slowly, but joyously — "This 
 chance will prove as good for me, as half thy revenues, 
 counted in my coffers, thou mighty renegade ! By my 
 hand, Ferdinand sends you tl)is!" With these words, he 
 drew his sword, and rushed towards where the African 
 had been standing, only a few seconds before. He had 
 already, however, retired within the umbrage of the 
 porch. The stranger pursued, but suddenly drew back, 
 and gazed about him bewildered. The man, whom 
 he had just destined for his victim, had vanished ! The 
 frustrate murderer presently turned about, and left the 
 place. His steps were measured, until he had passed 
 the wooded belt of the garden, when, immediately, with 
 rapid strides, he hurried along the narrow street, and 
 soon reached the barrier. Here, the sentinel on duty 
 stopped him ; but being in possession of the counter- 
 sign, he was allowed to quit the city ; and the last glance 
 from Heaven, on that day, threw his gigantic shadow, 
 upon horseback, along the wayside, many leagues dis- 
 tant, from the city of Hermanstadt. 
 
 A few minutes after the departure of the stranger, 
 Scipio, was again, in the gardens of the palace, and stood, 
 at Ferraro's side, ere the other knew of his approach. 
 *' Boy ! look up !" cried the African, in a loud voice. 
 
 Waking from his reverie, with a start, Ferraro looked 
 around.

 " So thou art come," he said, in a tone, that seemed 
 deeply agitated, by his melancholy reflections. " I have 
 been some time waiting." 
 
 " You are to blame," observed the black, "to make 
 yourself the general spectacle : — your vagaries have been 
 the subject of observation, to the accidental passengers, 
 for the last half hour." 
 
 " It matters not ; all is over," returned Ferraro, and 
 he hung his head, as if in hopeless despondency. 
 
 *'What can have happened, to unhinge thy mind to 
 this degree?" demanded the African. 
 
 '* Art thou wise ?" said Ferraro ; '' if so, leave me to 
 my fate." 
 
 "Never!" answered Scipio. Then, in a more persua- 
 sive accent, he continued, "Come, come, be advised — 
 tell me, the source of these throes of sorrow : methinks 
 thou canst feel none, I cannot remedy, — perhaps, do not 
 already guess." 
 
 " Thou liest, old man," answered the other, with yet 
 greater distemperature of manner, — " this grief is beyond 
 thy ken. Thy words are ever false ; they soothe my 
 senses, indeed, for the instant, but they are breath, 
 and leave no monument behind : thou shouldst blush, 
 through that visage of thine, were it begrimed, as with 
 the smoke of hell, for having lured me on, day after 
 day, as in a dream. Oh ! what a dolt was I, to 
 suppose, that thou hadst power to save me from the 
 brink ! Ere your honeyed words taught me to hope, I 
 was content — ay, content, though wretched. Now! I 
 have indulged myself in dreams of transport, which, to 
 realize, the paradise of the false prophet, were well forti- 
 fied. I will not have my dazzling, and heaven-capped 
 visions topple from their base ; — 'twas you first set me on 
 to build them. If they dissolve," he concluded, in a pa- 
 roxysm of emotion, which had in it something almost 
 frantic, — " may the vast ruin crush you !" 
 
 " I know, it was no light matter I engaged for," re-

 plied the black ; " but I repeat, Ferraro, that the Queen 
 of Hungary shall, one day, be yours." 
 
 " One day, say you !" echoed Ferraro, with a yell of 
 agony. " Ay, the one day, which yonder planet has 
 already worn to the dregs ; — this day, or never! — Did 
 not the angel, you have in pay, tell you so much? — I 
 have had presents from the Marquis Piadena." 
 
 " Well," said the African, in a calm voice. 
 
 " Do you hear? — from the Imperial court!" 
 
 " Well," repeated the other, with imperturbable gra- 
 vity: "Well, well! — and is that all ? 1 tell you, 
 these despatches, writ in gall, brewed from the infer- 
 nal Styx, bear my damnation. Can your wisdom di- 
 vine how ?" 
 
 " Coloswar is invested," replied the black ; " and, fur- 
 ther, the army of your royal master, by forced marches, 
 hath entrenched itself at Alba Julia." 
 
 "Man!" ejaculated Ferraro, in an accent of uncon- 
 trolled wonder. There was silence for above a minute; at 
 length the secretary again spoke : " So, black magician ! 
 what besides ?" And the impassioned youth stood, with 
 his arms folded, whilst he awaited the other's answer. 
 
 It was almost instantly rendered. " In consequence 
 of the absence of the Marquis of Piadena, you are in- 
 vested with authority, by your king, to declare war, in 
 his name, unless, without reservation, certain conditions 
 be complied with." 
 
 " Black magician !" said Ferraro, with a look of in- 
 creased astonishment, and awe ; and in a voice, whose tones 
 were far deeper, and more concentrated, than before ; 
 " Can you name those conditions ?" 
 
 "The immediate deposition of the daughter of John, 
 and Isabella, in favour of Martinuzzi, who is to hold his 
 crown, as tributary vassal to Ferdinand. That is the first 
 condition. 
 
 " The second is the cession of Transylvania, to the 
 crown of Austria, on the demise of Martinuzzi."

 "■ Verily, thou hast not been misinformed," exclaimed 
 Ferraro, with bitterness, " let thy information come from 
 what fiend it may. However, say on ; what instructions 
 besides ?" 
 
 " You are ordered, in case these terms (as is well 
 taken for granted) be rejected, forthwith to demand your 
 safe-conduct, and proceed hence, without loss of time, to 
 join the Austrian army, of which Castaldo hath already 
 assumed the command." 
 
 '' And you know all this?" shouted Ferraro, in a voice 
 of thunder. " Grant, my punishment was ordained, were 
 there no bolts but these to hurl, at my devoted head ? By 
 the red expiation of my soul, 'tis past endurance ! I rob 
 my adored Czerina of her kingdom ! I rudely snatch her 
 coronet, from her beauteous head ! I remain at l.er court, 
 like an infernal lie, as an assurance of peace, betwixt the 
 two kingdoms, whilst Ferdinand marches an hostile army, 
 into the heart of the country ! Now, what say you, to this 
 accumulation of horrors, thou never-failing mediciner?" 
 
 Ferraro ceased, and, with a gaze of unutterable an- 
 guish, looked in the face of his sable counsellor. Scipio 
 remained mute. There was solitude over that landscape. 
 The gardens of the palace were deserted, and as they 
 glared on one another, with a meteoric, and similar ex- 
 pression, in both their eyes, they offered no bad image of 
 two of the enemies of man, met, on this nether sphere, to 
 consult about the kidnapping of human souls. 
 
 The African was the first to speak. " Ferraro," he 
 said, in a solemn voice, " it is the part of a coward to 
 despair ; the brave man hopes on to the end. The 
 chances of time flit along the horizon of his life, till 
 time is no more ; perhaps, indeed, he may not clutch 
 them, but they soothe the fancy, nevertheless ; or, when 
 they delude no longer, there is eternity .'" 
 
 " Dost preach?" exclaimed Ferraro, in a transport of 
 passion.

 black. " If, what I have just divined, be all your diffi- 
 culty, it need not distress you." 
 
 " How ?" returned the secretary, breaking in with in- 
 creasing wildness of speech, and gesture — " Not distress 
 me, to depose Czerina by force of arms, and despoil her 
 of her royal inheritance ! What do you dream of?" 
 
 ''The conditions annexed to peace may be accepted," 
 observed the black. 
 
 " No, 'tis vain to reckon on that, than which no dream 
 is less substantial." said Ferraro, after a moment's pause; 
 '" 'twould brand the proud name of Martinuzzi, with ever- 
 lasting infamy, for him to stoop so low, as to become the 
 servile minister of a foreign court." 
 
 " Perhaps so ; yet continue not in error, Ferraro," 
 said the black ; *' those conditions of peace, you will lay 
 before Martinuzzi, will be subscribed." 
 
 " Away ! thou dost malign the regent," answered Fer- 
 raro, with the enthusiasm which belonged to his charac- 
 ter ; " thou dost him foul wrong, sir. The guardian and 
 protector turn usurper ? Never ! Martinuzzi prove false 
 to himself, and his country ? No, sir ! He knows too well 
 what he owes to his exalted reputation, to wreck it, on 
 such pitiful ambition. Indeed, you belie him; he is not 
 the man to comprise, in one bad deed, all that is dis- 
 honourable, and cruel." 
 
 Scipio looked upon his enthusiastic companion, for a 
 minute, without replying. At length, with a deep so- 
 lemnity of manner, he made answer — " The exact mea- 
 sure of iniquity that enters into any act, can be known, 
 Antoine, only to the Searcher of all hearts ; the best of 
 us are but men, and liable to the infirmities of human 
 nature ; and are not to be tried by the standard of their 
 own, sometime, and, perchance, short-lived perfection, 
 which were a criterion, more adapted to the unfaltering 
 purity of angels. Trust me, Martinuzzi will subscribe 
 the terms proposed, by your royal master." 
 
 The African spoke slowly, and earnestly ; and a pause

 ensued, which he broke, by abruptly asking, as if at the 
 suggestion of a sudden thought — '' Have you explained 
 the situation of your heart, to the fair lady of your love ? 
 Believe me, as matters stand, it is your only course. 
 The sooner you prevail, on the lady Czerina, to give you 
 a title to protect her, the better for herself. Seek her, as 
 near her solitude, as you may penetrate. Have you yet 
 spoken out V 
 
 " Ah! my friend," answered Ferraro, " what need of 
 words, to make her understand, how I do languish for 
 her ? If," he proceeded, in a strain, and accent of the 
 deepest feeling, " if she cannot read the state of my 
 affections, in the long-drawn sigh, that will not be sup- 
 pressed — in the vainly-guarded glances of unutterable 
 devotion, which will escape me, when I am near her — in 
 the voluptuous trembling of my frame — in the flush, with 
 which an inadvertent word suflfuses me, and the deep 
 paleness, which succeeds — in the moving languor, which 
 subdues me in her presence — in my broken speech, and 
 in the, still more prevailing, eloquence of silence — in my 
 departed spirits, and in my declining health — surely, my 
 friend, if appeals, like these, can't touch the sympathy of 
 woman, 'twere a waste of breath, to unlock the fountains 
 of the sealed-up heart, and speak." 
 
 '^ Ah ! Ferraro," said the African, evincino:the strong:-

 life-blood necessary, to obtain thee the hand of the young 
 queen, so Heaven deal with me, in my need I if I would 
 not submit my neck to the headsman's axe, or the assas- 
 sin's steel, both of which, God wot how difficultly, I have 
 for so many years evaded. Still, let not this thing dull 
 the current of thy young blood, but speak to the lady. 
 There is a minute — such omnipotence hath sympathy 
 over the female heart — in which a lover's presence is 
 irresistible, and when he will not woo in vain."

 presume no more, and feel it is almost blasphemy, even 
 in my dreams, to clasp her shadow." 
 
 " I believe," replied the black, " I can imbue you 
 with a motive, sufficiently startling, to oblige you to 
 penetrate the cloud of her divinity, and embrace a sub- 
 stance for thy pains." 
 
 " What doth thy speech imply ?" inquired the secre 
 tary. 
 
 ** This much ; that unless you speedily come to expla- 
 nation with the lady, she will be compelled to surrender 
 lier hand to Solyman." 
 
 " What say you ?" demanded Ferraro, in the hollow 
 tones of anguish, and amazement. 
 
 " I tell you, the Sultan asks the queen of Hungary in 
 marriage," answered the black. 
 
 " Then, God help her !" said Ferraro, in solemn ac- 
 cents ; " and God preserve my poor senses ; for fate, it 
 seems, has taken her side — the side of wrong and misery. 
 Yet, how can you suppose, the knowledge of my passion 
 might avert the destruction of us both ?" 
 
 " Why," replied the black, " were she conscious, that 
 your arms were unto her, as a haven, the strong necessity 
 of her heart would bid her stand at bay, and laugh to 
 derision, the menaces of Isabella." 
 
 " Whose I" exclaimed Ferraro. 
 
 " The queen dowager," replied the black. 
 
 " Ha ! and is that it?" cried Ferraro, with increasing 
 energy, and haste; "then this alliance you speak of, 
 Scipio, is of her mother's concocting, is it V 
 
 " The queen regent has entered into a sort of treaty, 
 with Solyman, the main stipulation of which is, the sacri- 
 fice of Czerina." 
 
 " How know you this ?" demanded Ferraro. 
 
 " I overheard Isabella expatiate largely to her daugh- 
 ler, on the advantage of the connection." 
 
 *' You overheard this, my friend !" cried Ferraro, in 
 amazement. ** Do you mean, that you were present ?"

 " I believe, I must acknowledge as much," answered 
 the black, with a grim smile. 
 
 *' Sacred Providence !" cried Ferraro ; "was Czerina 
 a party to her mother's views ?" 
 
 " She protested she would sooner die, than suffer, in 
 her person, such a profanation of the sacrament of mar- 
 riage." 
 
 " That 's some comfort, yet," said Ferraro. 
 
 "But," rejoined the African, "she will find herself 
 too feeble to resist, for any length of time, the arts, and 
 rage of Isabella." He paused, and then, in a tone of 
 greater depth, and seriousness than before, continued — 
 " The autumn leafage, fallen in yonder basined lake, 
 whirls, ever and anon, upon the eddying breeze, oscilla- 
 ting, hither and thither, between wind and water ; yet 
 must be ultimately wafted along upon the ripples of the 
 current : thus Czerina's mind, however it may struggle, 
 to and fro, for awhile, will finally set, in the direction of 
 her mother's wishes. On you, depends her only chance 
 of deliverance ; be the result what it may, declare your- 
 self immediately: do so, lest your — I would say, lest 
 Maximilian, Count Pereny, anticipate you." 
 
 " Ha !" exclaimed Ferraro. 
 
 " Do so," continued the black, " ere some brigand 
 chief, so plentiful in these bad, and broken times, forestall 
 your purposes." 
 
 " What mean you?" cried Ferraro. 
 
 " Do so," proceeded the black, without noticing the 
 interruption, " ere Isabella take effectual means, to pre- 
 vent you." 
 
 The glow faded, from Ferraro's cheek ; he moved one 
 step backwards, as if struck, by something, in the black's 
 last observation, and observed — " Then will I confess : 
 pray Heaven, as you say, it be not already too late. If 
 Isabella discover my love, for her daughter, I am undone; 
 for, oh ! my friend, learn that — " Here, arresting the 
 current of his speech, Ferraro stopped short, like one,

 who is afraid of committing himself. " No, for shame ! 
 Ferraro," he subjoined, in a lower key, '* that were un- 
 worthy of me to allude to." 
 
 *' What must I believe ?"' demanded the black, has- 
 tily. 
 
 " It boots not now to tell," returned Ferraro, with 
 assumed indifference ; " only if the queen regent should 
 obtain a knowledge of my passion, for the lady Czerina, 
 there remains not the remotest chance, that the star of 
 my love will be propitious." 
 
 The African listened attentively, but, with the counte- 
 nance of a man, lost in profound, and anxious rumination. 
 ''A painful idea flashes on me," he muttered, musingly, 
 in a hoarse, and altered tone — " 'Tis, indeed," he said, 
 affecting a calmness, he was far from feeling, '' a fatal 
 quicksand, on which you have cast your hopes. But — " 
 Here the accents of the black swelled into sternness, and 
 he raised up his clenched hands, as he inquired, with 
 vehemence, "Who gave you permission, sir?" Then, 
 breaking off, in some confusion, after a minute's pause, 
 he ejaculated to himself, with strong agitation of manner, 
 although in a suppressed voice — " Oh cursed! in every 
 way — in retrospect — in prospect. Both, too !" 
 
 The young secretary looked on, amazed, for a moment, 
 and then, impatient of the conference, intimated, that 
 even whilst he spake, the regent had promised to allow 
 him an audience. The two shortly separated, the black, 
 with a saddened brow, striking into the deepest of the 
 neighbouring thickets; and Ferraro, as Scipio disappeared 
 from view, taking the nearest path, that led to the Gothic 
 keep of Hermanstadt. 
 
 Antoine Ferraro, early an orphan, was the grandson, 
 on the mother's side, and pupil, of the celebrated historian, 
 Jerome Lascus, erewhiles palatine of Seradia. The ad- 
 ventures, and hair-breadth scrapes of that personage, fall 
 not within the scope of our story. His life had been in 
 imminent danger, from the dungeon of Solyman, the tor-

 tures of John of Zapola, and the poisonous medicaments 
 of Sigismund, king of Poland, his native sovereign. For 
 the last few years of his eventful, and protracted pilgrim- 
 age, he had resided in Vienna, on a small pension, 
 allowed him, in consideration of his counsel, and services, 
 by the archduke Ferdinand. It was long since reported, 
 throughout Europe, that the lamented statesman had 
 fallen a victim to his hardships, and misfortunes, and the 
 secret of his continued existence was only promulged, to 
 a very few of his most assured, and intimate friends. 
 
 On the Marquis of Piadena being appointed ambas- 
 sador to Hermanstadt, Lascus's interest obtained, for his 
 grandson, the situation of secretary to that nobleman. 
 At parting, Ferraro was enjoined, by his venerable pre- 
 ceptor, to seek out, in the capital of Transylvania, a friend 
 of his father's; and recommended, at the same time, to 
 take no measure of importance, without that person's con- 
 currence. 
 
 " And who, and what may be this individual ?" inquired 
 Ferraro. 
 
 ''An African," answered Lascus, *' at present in the 
 service of the holy confessor of cardinal Martinuzzi. 
 Resort to him, in all times of inquietude, and peril, as you 
 would to me, were you in Vienna." 
 
 " A menial were a fine counsellor, truly, for one, who 
 wears chain and spurs !" exclaimed Ferraro, with no little 
 disdain. 
 
 '' He is not what he seems," rejoined Lascus. '' Respect 
 my wishes, Antoine, in giving heed to that man. He is 
 your fate 1" 
 
 This request, so solemnly enjoined, was not disregarded. 
 From the moment of Ferraro's introducing himself to the 
 notice of the black, he felt drawn towards him, by an im- 
 pulse, the force of which he could neither understand, nor 
 oppose. The attendant of Father Dominick, obtained an 
 influence over him, so powerful, that into his ears he freely 
 confided all his most treasured thoughts, and wishes, till,

 in an evil hour, he yielded to a temptation, that shame, 
 and honour, alike forbade his communicating to his sable 
 intimate. But when, subsequently, the true flame of his 
 passion for the queen of Hungary, absorbed and swallowed 
 up, like the rod of Aaron, the false, and sensuous incan- 
 tations which preceded it, Ferraro made the black the con- 
 fidant of his audacious love, and was encouraged, by that 
 mysterious man, to prosecute his suit, in the certainty of 
 not being refused her royal hand, by her guardian, if he 
 could only obtain her own consent, to make him king of 
 Hungary, 
 
 We will now return to where we left the young secre- 
 tary, proceeding with all speed, to his interview with Mar- 
 tinuzzi. The mere distance he had to traverse, was not 
 o-reat; nevertheless, it took him some time to surmount 
 all the embarrassments of the ruinous street — and this 
 period he employed, in endeavouring to collect his scat- 
 tered thoughts, that he might play his part, with proper 
 dignity, in the impending conference, with the regent. 
 To his discretion, was entrusted the majesty of Austria, 
 and however, in his secret soul, he might scorn the dupli- 
 city of Ferdinand, it was not for him, in his sacred capa- 
 city, to betray his sentiments, or to derogate, from the 
 honour of the sovereign, who employed him, by any ad- 
 mission of his treachery. Still, he could not but be con- 
 scious, that he was charged with a commission, in the 
 highest degree, dangerous, and delicate, and his generous 
 mind revolted, at having to palliate, or rather justify, so 
 atrocious a proceeding, as the invasion of the territory of 
 an ally, with the object of dethroning the sovereign, and 
 despoiling her of her dominions. 
 
 The prize, held out to the ambition of the regent, he 
 looked upon, as no less disgraceful, in his court, to offer, 
 than beneath the dignity of Martinuzzi, to accept. He 
 adhered most constantly, and inflexibly to his first opinion, 
 that the proposition, he had to submit, would be rejected, 
 with unqualified disdain. Still, after his late conference,

 MANUSCRIPT VI. 257 
 
 with Scipio, he could not shut out ideas of an opposite 
 kind, nor help wishing-, that ^lartinuzzi might, in this in- 
 stance, not act up, to those exalted preconceptions of his 
 charEtcter, which his actions had inspired. Yet, when he 
 further came to reflect, that that side of the alternative, 
 involved the deposition of his adored Czerina, he could 
 only accuse himself of selfishness, in contemplating the 
 possibility of such an issue, with any feelings of satisfaction. 
 And yet, Ferraro did regard the contingency of Marti- 
 nuzzi's acquiescence, in the demands of Ferdinand, with a 
 partial gleam of undefined, and ineffable delight. Would 
 not the very fact of the young queen's resignation of her 
 crown, pave the way for his pretensions, by rendering her 
 a more legitimate object of ambition? And would not 
 he remain in Hermanstadt, in peace, instead of having to 
 enter the city, through carnage, and in triumph ? Thus, 
 he pondered within himself, and who, with such happi- 
 ness in prospect, could turn away his mind, at the voice 
 of principle, and notcherish, with Ferraro, a confused hope, 
 that the indulgence of his passions might, by some means 
 or other, yet in the womb of fate, be found compatible 
 with his public duty,* and that circumstances would 
 reconcile, and subserve, his secret purposes ? 
 
 Presently, these sanguine considerations, which had just 
 flowed, with the most plenteous tide, began to ebb; and 
 again Ferraro argued, with a curdling of the blood, that 
 the injured maiden would never endure the presence of a 
 man, who, by her dethronement, had put a sudden date to 
 the regal dynasty, of which she was the illustrious repre- 
 sentative. Would she condescend, to return the aflfections 
 of one, who came, like a mildew, in the hands of tyranny, 
 to blight her fair leaves of promise? Yet, again, where-

 fore suffer his thoughts, to glance that way ? What signi- 
 fied his bewailing the wretchedness of this chance, when 
 it was more probable, he continued, in gloomy foreboding, 
 that the stern virtue of Martinuzzi was destined, to present 
 him, with ampler matter, for his future ruminations, and 
 despair? Oh! it was too evident, his hard fate would 
 never more connive, at his feeding, in raptextacy, on each 
 graceful motion of Czerina's form, till his whole soul 
 seemed to himself dissolving away, before the beautiful 
 vision. — He would never! — But here the train of Ferraro's 
 lamentations was necessarily broken. His thoughts had 
 carried him so far, as to a species of ante-room, or vesti- 
 bule, and thence they inducted him into the audience 
 closet of the cardinal.

 It is a remark, which has been so often iterated, from the 
 earliest era, down to the present day, as almost to have 
 slid into an adage, that whereas poets picture the golden 
 age, whilst the world was yet young, so childhood is the 
 golden season of human life. But, although this analogy 
 may hold correct, in part, it is far from being universally 
 predicable. Not to mention the thousands, and tens of 
 thousands, of little human creatures, from the sweat of 
 whose young brows, the wealth of nations is painfully 
 distilled, (as we are neither penning a satire, nor a sermon, 
 we need not be more explicit), and who, ere the waters of 
 baptism are dry upon their heads, — yea, with their mother's 
 milk yet warm on their livid lips, begin their unhallowed

 on, till precocious passion dawns, to redeem their capti- 
 vity, at once gilding, with its false hectic, the sombre 
 colouring of their lives, and, with its fruitless stings,* 
 spurring them forward, to the close. Not to insist on such, 
 let us glance our mind's eye, on those children of compe- 
 tence, who are presumed to commence their lives, under 
 happier auspices. But, in this survey, however, we may 
 persuade ourselves, we can only determine of the whole, 
 by a limited induction of particulars. 
 
 In the spring of life, however regretful the current of 
 our days, sorrow has scarce had time, to leave his distin- 
 guishing traces, in the lines of our countenances, — the 
 physiognomy is yet unformed, and that secret, " w^hich 
 weighs on the heart," but which cannot be gathered, from 
 the features, it were in vain to seek, in the confession of 
 the sufferer. There is seldom much sympathy between 
 the child, and the adult. Neither are their joys mutual, 
 nor sorrows, in common ; and, when sympathy is with- 
 held, or believed to be so, by what conjuration can confi- 
 dence be induced? Youth is more frequently the season of 
 reserve, than people imagine; and the young heart, in, 
 by far the greater part of its depths, remains a holy, 
 and hidden thing, only known to its Omniscient Searcher. 
 Grief and anxiety do not, it is true, commonly lay an 
 invincible hold of us, in childhood. The elasticity of 
 that early period of existence, will soon procure an in- 
 terval of repose, which, however, be it remembered, is no 
 less transient, than the anguish which preceded it. Indeed, 
 it may fairly be made a question, whether the briefness 
 of infantile sorrow can counterpoise its degree of agony, 
 or compensate, for the frequency of its recurrence. " The 
 tear forgot as soon as shed," we do not believe in; but if 
 the experience of the reader be happier than our ov/n, let 
 him recollect, how many a scalding, though, (we grant) 
 causeless, tear blots the fair page of the history of child-

 hood. We are persuaded, that the judgments conceived 
 of the disposition, and state of mind of the juvenile portion 
 of society, by their nearest connections, are often falla- 
 cious, and too hastily imbibed; they contemplate the 
 habits of the helpless being-, under their control, through 
 too close, and therefore a delusive medium, which dis- 
 colours, and perverts, the object ; and are apt to reconcile, 
 and accommodate, whatever fall under their observation, 
 to some hastily conceived theory, with which, not once 
 in a hundred instances, will they be found, exactly, to 
 quadrate. 
 
 Thus, building, with inadequate materials, a baseless 
 edifice of character, and disposition, and grasping some 
 shadowy semblances, they early begin to fashion the mind, 
 and heart, of their young disciple, according to their pre- 
 onceptions, and ever afterwards, misinterpret all his 
 minutest words, and indifferent actions; viewing them, 
 not as they are, but according to the nice, and deceptious 
 microscope of parental, or kindred prejudice. It is as- 
 tonishing the injustice, that is, not seldom, committed, by 
 these false constructions, and the puerile grief and indig- 
 nation to which they give rise, are more excessive, than 
 the injured party cares to acknowledge. But, were there 
 no other cause, than the abject state of subjection, to 
 which the free wmU of children is condemned, in, what is 
 called, civilized society, that were more than sufficient to 
 countervail every incentive to happiness, whether spring- 
 ing, from the accident of prosperity, or the more intrinsic 
 advantage of a lively temperament.

 The high constable, Hubert Vicchy,* Duke of Eissen- 
 burg, had been several years governor of Temeswar, 
 when John of Zapola died. He was the main-spring of 
 the abortive movement of Valentine Turascus, in favour 
 of the queen regent, which we briefly noticed, in our in- 
 troductory chapter. His duchess was a lady, of whom, 
 it might be difficult to say, whether the graces of her 
 person, or her mental endowments, were more admirable. 
 But these virtues were only the shining sins of a he- 
 retic. Her firm, and inquisitive understanding had not 
 shrunk from polemics ; and the new teachers, who pro- 
 fessed to revive the old truths of the Gospel, taught her 
 to abjure that admixture of error, and those " weak in- 
 ventions of the enemy," with which, they affirmed, that 
 the simplicity, and purity of the Christian faith, during 
 the long night of Gothic ignorance, had been conta- 
 minated, and overlaid. From her cradle, the daughter 
 of Veronica had the virtues, and faith of her mother 
 wound into her fair form ; and the trials of her subse- 
 quent life only rivetted those intermediate links, in the 
 chain of evidence, which bound her pious spirit to the 
 vital truths of the reformed religion. 
 
 The reader may marvel, how such a woman came to 
 unite her fate with one, who was ignorant of the lowest 
 elements of literature ; — but the wonder will subside, 
 if our fair critic will please, to look a little closer, into the 
 state of society, in Hungary, in the sixteenth century, 
 and ask herself, seriously, how she would like, to have 
 been debarred, entering the blessed state of holy matri- 
 mony, simply because the young gentleman, who soli- 
 cited the honour of her hand, happened (like most of his 
 compeers) to have left uncultivated the belles lettres ? 
 
 * The Christian appellation, which this person bears in history, is 
 Peter, for which, lest the reader should confound the principal charac- 
 ters of our tale, we have substituted the name of Hubert. We have 
 already risked introducing two Peters, which, however, is the fault of 
 their godfathers and godmothers, and none of ours.

 When we are told, owing- to the disorders, which accu- 
 mulated on the country, subsequent to the battle of 
 Mohacs, that no fewer than seven bishops* flourished, in 
 a most unorthodox state of incertitude, as to the dis- 
 tinctive characters of the alphabet ; it cannot be made a 
 matter of surprise, that the feudal barons, who were 
 military men, were content to repose, in the lethargy of 
 ignorance, without coveting a greater degree of erudition, 
 than was exacted, by the opinions of the age, and which, 
 they saw, might suffice their " spiritual pastors and 
 masters." If this explanation fail to reconcile the diffi- 
 culty, we can only regret, that the stubborn nature of 
 historical truths must preclude us, were we the most 
 daring legendary, from forbidding the banns. 
 
 Whether Vicchy deferred invariably to his gifted part- 
 ner's depth of sagacity, or firmness of mind, we are not 
 instructed to state ; and this expressive silence of con- 
 temporary satire, furnishes such strong presumption to 
 the contrary, as ought, by rights, to more than outweigh, 
 in the scale of evidence, any loose, and floating atoms of 
 later scandal. It is likely, however, that the natural in- 
 fluence, which a strong, will insensibly obtain, over a 
 feebler understanding, if moving in the same orbit, may 
 have exercised a salutary restraint upon Vicchy, and 
 that, on many occasions, he found the domus et placens 
 uxor, the softening sense, and silken trammels of home, 
 sustain his wavering resolution. 
 
 It was shortly after that period, v.hen his outlawry had 
 been decreed, by the states of Transylvania, that the 
 death of Veronica cut him out, from those moorings of 
 the heart, whose cable alone held his vacillating passions, 
 in the roadstead of virtue, and discretion, and set his 
 soul adrift, upon the waves of life, at the mercy of the

 Veronica of Eissenburg, from the time of her mother's 
 death, to the midnight hour, in which we first introduced 
 the maiden, en dishabille, to the blushes of our readers, 
 had been the constant, and cheerful companion, and 
 friend, of her blasted, dishonoured, and outcast father. 
 Whilst, close, and closer, in the clouds of adversity, and 
 error, that father wrapt himself, from the contemplation 
 of the present, and the prospect of the future, she would 
 dry those orbs, veiled by the dim suffusion of mortality,'* 
 and shed a glory, round the deepening infamy of his path, 
 as the " hastening angel" might be supposed to hallow 
 the declining footsteps of our first parents, in their soli- 
 tary way from Eden. Nor did she, at last, cease from 
 her ministering office, when the object of all her soli- 
 citude too visibly displayed the mire, and rust, which, 
 during his travail in a defiling world, his soul had 
 contracted. *' The sworded angel" turned back, at 
 the gates of paradise, and abandoned our guilty an- 
 cestors to '' the fruit of that forbidden tree, whose 
 mortal taste brought death into the world." He was 
 deterred, by the black, and heavy mists of sin, and mor- 
 tality, which, like a mantle, shrouded the horizon of this 
 low earth. Not so Veronica. — She only adhered the 
 more steadfastly, in her patient devotedness, to the 
 slightest wishes of her sire, as the faculties of mind and 
 body began to expand, and she became more sensible of 
 the debasing character of sin, and involuntarily grasped 
 the conviction of Vicchy's frailty. If his crimes were ma- 
 nifold, utter likewise was his defeature ; and, though the 
 goods of this life melted away, — though followers, and 
 friends fell off, and the whole world forsook him, — though 
 Justice shook her strong steel, and waved it, like the

 his soul was tossed ; — ay, even in the central darkness 
 of a dishonoured grave, her pious offices would avail to 
 embalm, and emblazon his memory, and her affections, 
 hovering nigh, would hang about his hearse, like plumed 
 pennons. 
 
 At the time, that Vicchy was cited to surrender him- 
 self to trial, the life of his Veronica was hovering on the 
 confines of two worlds. Thus circumstanced, he na- 
 turally refused, while the vital spark " lit her mortal 
 frame," to quit her death-bed. In consequence, the 
 summary proceeding of his outlawry intervened, and in- 
 spired him, with sentiments of implacable enmity to that 
 state, which, without evidence or trial, had thus thrust 
 him, beyond the pale of her society, and the protection 
 of her laws. He vowed, in his secret soul, he would lie 
 in wait, for a day of retribution ; but his opportunities, 
 in that regard, long fluctuated, with the vicissitudes of 
 his life. As a vessel, intercepted in its course, by op- 
 posing winds, Hubert's characteristic indecision operated, 
 when his hopes were at the flood, to suspend, till the 
 time for action had escaped, his powers of volition.

 This may go far to explain, why " all the courses of his 
 life were bound in shallows, and in misery." 
 
 One of the ancients* has remarked, that it is in human 
 life, as in a game at tables, — and the analogy would seem 
 to hold good in a sense, that was not contemplated. The 
 utmost skill, or the finest schemes, that can be laid by 
 human wisdom, may be alike neutralized, and perverted, 
 where the chances of the game are against us ; while, on 
 the other hand, even a series of good fortune supposes a 
 certain felicitous daring, in the person whom it befalls; and 
 the highest cast of the die were thrown in vain, unless the 
 player be gifted with the happy rashness, to seize the 
 occasion, and improve his advantage. 
 
 Somewhat in conformity, with this way of thinking, was 
 an opinion, which formerly prevailed, that Fortune ever 
 lent her aid to the prudent ;t nor should the fine and deep 
 reflection of Fontenelle, to the same purpose, be lost 
 sight of, — " Ces bons hasards," he says, " ne sont que 
 pour ceux qui jouent bien." 
 
 From all we can gather of his character, Vicchy must 
 have answered, badly. Dr. Johnson's idea of " a good 
 hater," although, in the sad varieties of his subsequent 
 career, while yielding to every temptation of circumstance, 
 he wrapped himself, from the upbraidings of his own 
 heart, by saying, and believing, that he was only varying 
 his means, the better to ascertain that vengeance, to 
 which, in reality, he had become wholly indifferent. 
 
 Whilst his prospects gradually became black, and com- 
 fortless, on all sides. Crime, alternated with superstitious 
 devotion in his bosom, as day with night, in some dark 
 cemetery. At one time, he would take Satan's wages, to 
 satisfy the idolatrous worship of gold, the arwi sacra 
 fames, which informed, and animated the minutest of his 
 undertakings, and would, soon after, appease the antagonist

 principle of his nature, by offering the accursed coin, on 
 the altar, pro remedio animcB suce. Alas ! how will not 
 fortune, and circumstance degrade the original excellence 
 of our common humanity, to a level with the foulest aspect 
 of the outer world ! How will not time break down the 
 stubborn spirit, no less than the marble column ! We 
 find the man, through whose hands once circulated the 
 revenue of a prince, coveting, in his adversity, a single 
 ducat, with such *' itchy palm," as to tamper, with his 
 soul's health, for the sake of its possession ! 
 
 For months subsequent to the death of the Duchess of 
 Eissenburg, and the outlawry of her husband, we aie 
 compelled, for want of materials, to grope our way very 
 much in the dark, during which space of time, we often 
 lose sight of Vicchy. It would seem, however, from the 
 slight, and incidental notice of contemporary annalists, 
 that he had not long taken up his abode in Poland, ere 
 the spirit of change seized him, and, after some hesitation^ 
 and the necessary delays of a few weeks, in equipping for 
 so formidable a migration, Hubert, as we shall still occa- 
 sionally call him, and his little girl, on horseback, accom- 
 panied by a guide, and two sumpter mules, for the pur- 
 pose of transporting their baggage, commenced their 
 route, upon the morning of a sultry summer's day. • Their 
 daily progress was measured, by the ability, or sluggish- 
 ness of the animals who bore them, and we have briefly to 
 pass over the interval of a fortnight, whereof, here needs 
 no account. Towards the close of that period, however, 
 our travellers fell in with an adventure, which somewhat 
 broke the monotonous agremens of their pilgrimage. 
 
 The incident, we allude to,may as well be inserted, in this 
 place, and, since it gave a fresh impulse to the ruin of 
 Vicchy, and has besides a considerable bearing, on tiie 
 mysteries of our story, we shall take leave, to lay it before 
 the reader, with some circumstantiality. 
 
 On the evening of the twelfth day, from their first setting 
 out, Vicchy, and his daughter had arrived, within a few

 hours' travel of the city of Coloswar. The weather had all 
 along proved remarkably propitious, but this day, on the 
 contrary, the sun's disk was obscured in lurid, and accu- 
 mulated clouds, which, fallen, and diffused into a uniform 
 haze, seemed charged with matter, for tempest, and storm. 
 The ineffectual struggle of the sun's rays soon ceased; 
 and long, ere the hour, when he should have sunk below 
 the horizon, a sylvan, and mountainous country might be 
 discerned, with difficulty. Vicchy had calculated on 
 reaching Coloswar, or, at least, the immediate neighbour- 
 hood of that city, ere nightfall, but the misty twilight 
 which thus early unrolled itself, upon hill and dale, 
 and the rapid drops of rain, which, somewhat abruptly, in- 
 flicted a severe drenching on our travellers, induced them 
 to look out, with no small anxiety, for some nearer place 
 of shelter for the night. The discomforts of their situ- 
 ation, would alone have been sufficient to urge them to 
 this; but, in addition, the horse, which their guide rode, 
 had thrown his forefoot shoe, and, despite their utmost 
 vigilance, it was difficult to distinguish the direction of 
 their journey, through a country, which particles of sleet, 
 and mist, shrouded in wildering darkness. Moreover, the 
 horses could hardly keep their feet, along the tracks of 
 jungle, and knolls, intercepted, at every turn, with swelling 
 streams, lashed by the irritating elements, into sheets of 
 foam. As they struggled forward, they came up with 
 three foot passengers. Whilst crossing a narrow bridge, 
 which brought their persons sensibly nearer, Veronica 
 pointed them out, to her father, who immediately accosted 
 them, inquiring, whether they could tell of any kortsma* 
 or monastery, or other place of shelter, thereabouts, where 
 a night's lodging might be procured ? 
 
 "What would you have of us?" interrogated one of 
 the trio, in a voice, that betokened disguise. 
 
 Vicchy repeated his question.

 " We are strangers in these parts, like yourselves ; but 
 I trow tliere be no hostelry, nor religious order either, be- 
 tween this, and Coloswar," was the cold, and evasive 
 response of another of these pedestrians. 
 
 " Hold well to your saddle, and we will put our horses 
 to the trot, my love," said her father, in a low voice to 
 Veronica; and then, having given his steed free head, he 
 hallooed to the guide, to keep up with them, while he, and 
 his child toiled along the broken, and dubious track, till 
 the straggling stumps, and protruding roots of old trees 
 again obliged them, to continue their journey, with a 
 slackened pace, and a guarded rein. However, they 
 breasted the fierce storm-gusts of wind, and drift, and 
 splashed through the deep brooks, which beset their way, 
 with dogged resolution, — the mind of Vicchy, infinitely 
 more tortured, with fears for his child's health, than on 
 account of his own personal sufferings, although they in- 
 cluded some inward misgivings, as to the cause of his 
 guide's prolonged separation. Presently, he mounted the 
 little girl, on his own horse, before him, and, wrapping his 
 cloak, so closely about her, as to shield her, in a great 
 degree, from the relentless dashing of the rain ; he led her 
 palfrey, with his left hand on the bridle, and thus held on 
 his way. 
 
 ^' Would you have rest, and shelter, for yourselves, and 
 weary beasts?" demanded some one, suddenly, in a rough, 
 and peculiar tone of voice, which sounded distinctly, 
 within arm's length of their horses' heads. 
 
 Vicchy started in his saddle, and, turning his eyes, 
 hastily, in the direction of the speaker, could discern, 
 (though nearly lost in shapeless darkness,) a tall figure, 
 walking by the side of the animal, on which Veronica had 
 ridden, and, at the same moment, he felt a strong hand 
 laid, upon the bridle. The voice he recognised for the 
 same, which, an hour before, had returned so evasive an 
 answer to his inquiry. " I thought, you told me erewhiles, 
 you were a stranger in these parts," observed Vicchy.

 " You have an ear, I wis, sir traveller," returned the 
 other : " I have subsequently been directed, to a sort of 
 manse hereabouts ; and if you, or your little one there, 
 would prefer fire, food, and shelter, to cold, hunger, and 
 a watery exit, you will, doubtless, yede ye wi' me." 
 
 The man ceased, and walked on, apparently awaiting 
 the answer of Vicchy, who, for a minute, revolved the 
 matter over, in his mind. He could not but marvel, how 
 a pedestrian, and one too, who professed to have no local 
 knowledge of the country, had contrived, for the last 
 hour, in the teeth of obstacles, which might seem insuper- 
 able, to keep up with himself, and child, notwithstanding 
 their superior facilities, for passing over the ground ; and, 
 if the difi&culty of the feat staggered him, his suspicions 
 were no less aroused, as to the motive, which prompted 
 the stranger to surmount it. He half feared, — as he recol- 
 lected, that he had companions, at the time, he first ac- 
 costed him, — that he was in the power of banditti. His 
 first impression, therefore, was to decline accompanying 
 the fellow ; but, the next instant, the storm reburst in 
 full violence, and the idea of his child being forced to 
 abide its brunt, crossed his mind, with a pang, that deter- 
 mined him, to risk accepting the man's proposal. Sup- 
 pressing, therefore, as far as he might, any appearance 
 of apprehension, he presently said ; " My good friend, 
 thine offer is fair, and we will e'en wend our way with 
 thee." 
 
 "Now, by my troth," returned the other, "from the 
 time you took to consider, it seemed to me, that you 
 had your private reasons, for not recking the deluge of 
 this mirksome night. Some folks," he added, placing his 
 hand, on the long mane* of the palfrey, and lightly

 vaulting into the seat, which Veronica had lately filled : 
 " some folks, I trow, never die of hydrophobia." 
 
 " Free and easy ! " thought Vicchy, as, reining back 
 his horse, he turned his head, to look after the follower, 
 who had the care of his wealth, and baggage ; but, only 
 six yards off, all things were wrapt in darkness^ and, re- 
 suming his course, Vicchy involuntarily heaved an ap- 
 prehensive groan. 
 
 ** By the mass ! " said his officious companion, ''though 
 Fm wrong to make an oath upon it, the sight of your 
 late guide, or his beast, is past an ave, on that you may 
 take my troth, an you will." 
 
 Vicchy would not condescend to demand an explana- 
 tion ; but his fears, respecting his property, became in- 
 tolerable, and he pursued his slow, and toilsome way, in 
 a state of mental agitation, which we will not essay to 
 describe. 
 
 In a short time, having deflected a little from the 
 road, into a narrow bridle-path, a sudden turn brought 
 the party, in front of a large quadrangular edifice. The 
 imperfect light hardly admitted of Vicchy's distinguish- 
 ing even a part of the outline of the building, which, 
 however, he judged to be vast, and dreary. It was mas- 
 sively built, and, like every other fortified mansion of 
 the country,* encompassed with a deep moat. Embosomed 
 amid huge trees, on the verge of a vast forest, it lay enscon- 
 ced, apparently guarded from casual discovery, by the tan- 
 gled difficulty of its access. Their pseudo guide soon 
 alighted, opposite the immense wide portals, before which 
 the drawbridge was raised up. Here, he applied to his 
 mouth a horn, chained to a large stone pillar, and blew a 
 loud blast. Presently a voice demanded, what they wanted. 
 Their conductor took on himself the task of explanation.

 "Three benighted travellers," he replied : " my master 
 and his child, and myself, their guide, crave shelter for 
 the night, from the inclemency of the weather." 
 
 A brief period of anxiety, toVicchy, followed, which was 
 determined by the slow lowering of the rattlingdrawbridge. 
 This (the unknown assuming the lead,) they crossed on 
 horseback; when, almost immediately, the loud groaning 
 of the laden windlasses, announced, that the bridge was 
 again being uplifted. And now, torches glared around our 
 travellers, who, after dismounting, were ushered through 
 a heavy gateway, into a large, low-roofed apartment, 
 where a " liveried army " of menials, in a double line, 
 awaited them. Her father, who had assisted Veronica 
 out of the saddle, and still retained her, in his arms, 
 well nigh dropped the child, to the ground, as his eyes 
 lit on the person of his mysterious conductor, which the 
 torch-light gave to view. For a moment, he deemed he 
 looked, indeed, upon the very guide, who had accompa- 
 nied him, from Warsaw. The habit, which was after a 
 peculiar fashion, Vicchy recalled, to the minutest parti- 
 cular, and, though he could not account for the meta- 
 morphosis, a dreadful suspicion, almost amounting to 
 conviction, crept over him, that it was the identical garb, 
 worn, by his absent follower. The physiognomy, how- 
 ever, of this man, was evidently of a different cast, al- 
 though an immense black patch, which hood-winked one 
 eye, and deformed half the visage, together with the 
 long flaxen hair, streaming, in thick profusion, over the 
 forehead, and bushy eye-brows, made it difficult, to dis- 
 tinguish the exact lineaments of a countenance so 
 strangely disfigured, and disguised. As Vicchy gazed, in 
 horrified amazement, he observed the stranger take, from 
 the pocket of his outward vest, a green scarf, and care- 
 lessly wrap it round the arm, near his right elbow, to 
 cover certain sanguine gouts, which discoloured the 
 sleeve.

 the descent of the bridge yonder," said the man, ad- 
 dressing himself to Vicchy, " but for the intervention of 
 St. John Nepamacene,* you had lost a guide whose 
 value — but, perdy, that were better left for others to tell 
 of, only, I trow, you might not readily have found a sub- 
 stitute." 
 
 "You bleed; are you much hurt, friend?" inquired 
 one of the swarm of lacqueys, who flocked around the 
 party. 
 
 " Not to signify, — a graze of the skin, — thank you, and 
 God be praised ! 1 am no chicken ;" responded the stran- 
 ger ; " no bones broken, — only a bruise, sir; yet who 
 v/ould think of as thorough-paced a garron,* I assure 
 you, as any on the roads, serving one such a jade's trick ? 
 A stumble, sir, a stumble ; but, gramercie ! the saint was 
 standing by at the time, do ye see ; so I shall survive this 
 bout." 
 
 Vicchy 's immediate impulse was to denounce the villain ; 
 but the consummate effrontery, his conduct exhibited, so 
 oppressed, and, as it were, overawed the magnat, that 
 he felt disinclined, to proceed to that extremity. While 
 he hesitated how to act, an old domestic, of grave and 
 formal deportment, entered the vestibule, and scanned 
 our belated travellers, with an eye of minute observation. 
 He came to announce, that Count Rodna, the proprietor 
 of the mansion, would be happy to receive the gentle- 
 man, and his daughter. Vicchy, retaining Veronica by 
 the hand, prepared to accompany the solemn seneschal, 
 for such was the man's office, — when a word, lowly spoken 
 in his ear, caused him to start, and turn his head. 
 
 " Eissenburg ! " whispered the fearful individual, who 
 had conducted him to the house, and who now seized his 
 arm, as he was about to pass, through the door of the

 apartment: " Eissenburg ! Outlaw! — I penetrate your 
 disguise ; breathe a syllable that may harm me, and, by 
 immortal vengeance ! the crow shall batten on thy stiffen- 
 ing corse, from the highest gibbet, in the city of Coloswar, 
 ere to-morrow's sun set. But keep a close tongue in 
 your head, sir duke, and I, on my part, will lock thy 
 secret, where only the Mano, and myself are like to find 
 it." Having thus spoken, the man turned on his heel ; 
 and Vicchy, at once surprised, indignant, and alarmed, 
 hastened, with his daughter, after the functionary. 
 
 The ideas, which filled the head of the miscreant, who 
 tarried behind, were much to the following purpose : — 
 
 *'So I have cowed our high constable, — there's nothing 
 sooner transmutes a man of metal to a coward, than the 
 thought of these young brats, with their milk-white 
 faces ! How I scared his dukeship, with his own man's 
 livery ! — my 'haviour overpowered him ! — Ha ! I have sel- 
 dom found it fail me : let me see ; — this Vicchy is, evi- 
 dently, a feeble-minded lord, and so men report him ; 
 and now, or I greatly err, the lord's a hetyar,- — a 
 betyar — so — and who ever heard speak of a beggar chaf- 
 fering, when gold was to be got at ? Every man, I opine, 
 hath his purchase; and be he poor, his conscience is less 
 costly ; besides, I have but to say the word, and, he 
 knows, his life is forfeited. All things considered, he'll 
 scarce sleep to-night — how, if I sound him ? For Pereny, 
 and that boy, — they shall, they must be murdered ! My 
 visit here, shall not be for nought ; — but Wurmser's mis- 
 adventure was ill-timed ; I could have better spared him, 
 after the deed. To decapitate son, as well as father, 
 and make aw^ay with their heads, undetected and un- 
 harmed, through the various hindrances of the barrica- 
 doed dwelling, and that without assistance, would seem 
 hardly feasible. This Herezegf is a proper person for 
 my purpose ; and him, my good genius hath sent me, at

 a pinch. I have only to superintend, and regulate, the 
 first paroxysms of his consternation, and despair, and, 
 peradventure, I may render both subservient to the ac- 
 complishment of the emperor's mandate. If, while I speed 
 Peter Pereny to his long, last reckoning, I could but in- 
 duce this weak nobleman, for love, — no, that will never 
 do, — well, lucre, — or, egad ! out of downright terror, to 
 puff out the light of the young whelp, — his duplicate, 
 the affair might be compassed without noise, or risk, on 
 my part: it is not unlikely; — I'll try for it, at all 
 events." The train of his thoughts was interrupted, by 
 the entrance of several of the household : " So, here are 
 those," he muttered to himself, " who must instruct me 
 in the ' whereabouts,' of this vast chateau ;" and the ras- 
 cal immediately addressed himself to the busy menials, 
 who were spreading the table, with dried caviare, veget- 
 ables, and fruit, in the Christian spirit of compromise, 
 significant of catholic hospitality, on a fast-day. 
 
 Let us return to Vicchy, who, with his child, emerged 
 again into the sweeping blast, and was marshalled, by the 
 solemn functionary aforesaid, across an open area, or 
 plot of grass, to a massive door, which gave access to the 
 main body of the building. Thence they were introduced, 
 through a spacious ante-room, into the presence of the 
 venerable proprietor of the mansion. 
 
 At the upper end of a large, and handsome apartment,, 
 the folding doors of which were thrown open, to receive 
 Vicchy, and his daughter, was seated Count Rodna, who 
 rose on their entrance, and, with reserved, though 
 stately courtesy, advanced ci few steps, to meet our tra- 
 vellers. With that undetinable, and unconstrained air, 
 that maniere d'etre, which decisive, and conscious worth, 
 or superiority of station, naturally induces, he begged to 
 be informed, how he might best evince the sincerity of 
 the welcome, he tendered? After briefly returning thanks, 
 Vicchy expressed an anxious wish, that his little girl 
 should instantly retire, and divest herself of her dripping

 clothes. Accordingly, Veronica was committed to the 
 motherly care of a female domestic, and, under her au- 
 spices, withdrew. Vicchy, his parental feelings being 
 thus relieved, proceeded to examine, with a degree of 
 wonder, deepened by involuntary respect, the person of 
 his ancient host. He seemed to have numbered at least 
 as many years of life, as the two wisest of men * have as- 
 signed, for the limit of human health, and vigour, at which 
 climacteric, our spiritual horizon dilates itself before us, and 
 whence the most hale, and strong are bid to contemplate, 
 in a deepening perspective of decay, and imbecilitv, the 
 brief remainder of their mortal tarriance, and the final 
 close of a protracted pilgrimage. His habit was becoming, 
 though not costly, and rather appeared under, than over, 
 his rank, as lord of that mansion. A valuable turquoise 
 ring might be discerned, on tlie middle finger of his right 
 hand, — it was the only ornament, he wore. A cap, or 
 bonnet, of green velvet, sat liglitly on his head, which a 
 few wintry hairs, the livery of age, could hardly be said 
 to exempt from total baldness. His height rose scarcely 
 above the middle standard, but it might be gathered, 
 from the compactness of his figure, though slightly bent 
 by years, that, in the prime of manhood, his person must 
 have been peculiarly adapted for jousts, tournaments, and 
 other athletic exercises of the tilt-yard. The whole cast 
 of his form, and countenance, might have afforded an 
 artist an admirable model, for the king of Pylos. An in- 
 describable halo of majesty, distinguished his every step, 
 and animated every gesture of his body. His very na- 
 ture, however, mellowed, by the gentle influence of Time, 
 or, it might be, subdued, by misfortune, appeared cir- 
 cumfused by that " divinity," which, in other days, was 
 thought to " hedge a king." 
 
 There was, indeed, a something, which might well be 
 termed regal, in the light of his full, hazel eye, chas-

 tened, as it was, by long abstinence from command, and 
 worldly dignity, and softened, by liis continued, and ex- 
 emplary observance, of certain ascetic rites of the Romish 
 church. So filled was the mind of Vicchy, with the im- 
 pression of venerable grandeur, which the appearance of 
 Count Rodna, unbowed, either by the weight of years, or 
 luxurious indulgence, was ever sure to inspire, that it 
 was not, till after some brief interval, that he took even a 
 cursory view of the apartment, into which he had been 
 ushered. The pannels, on every side, were framed of 
 polished cedar wood, heavily, though highly, wrought. 
 The lofty roof was rudely, and somewhat fantastically 
 carved into ornament, which, radiating, from the centre 
 of the ceiling, to the loaded cornices, became confounded 
 with their elaborate sculpturings. A coat of plate- 
 armour, and steel bonnet, corresponding to it; a dag, 
 and two-handed sword, set with precious stones, contri- 
 buted to relieve the gloomy splendour of the antique 
 chimney-piece, over which they hung. A range of nar- 
 row cells or niches, each hallowed, by the image of 
 some Romish saint, glittering in the impotency of paint, 
 and tinsel, (the Lares of the Catholic church), had been 
 skilfully carved, in the wooden entablature of the heavy 
 mantel. Some half dozen iron cressets, branching from 
 the wainscoat, at respective distances, lit up the cham- 
 ber. Three deep narrow windows, enriched with embla- 
 zoned glass, were now draperied from view, whilst, before 
 each arched recess, the voluminous curtains flung down, 
 from their faded festoons, in many an ample fold, the 
 long-suspended loopings, and fringes, which swept the 
 inlaid floor. 
 
 The old gentleman shortly broke the silence, by saying, 
 — "You have incurred no inconvenience, I trust, sir, 
 nor injury, from the effects of the storm, which a night's 
 good rest will not cause you to forget; indeed, if man 
 knew his real interest, he would rather pray for these 
 rubs, and temporary annoyances, than wish to be exempt

 from them : they teach him to seta just value, on his 
 own condition, and enhance, and give a zest to, those or- 
 dinary blessing's, which, otherwise, grown common, are 
 conceived, in the pride of possession, to be his inherent 
 right, till his soul forgets to thank the Giver of all good- 
 ness." 
 
 Vicchy, who, immediately looked on his host, as a very 
 saint-like personage, made a suitable reply ; and then he 
 could not avoid intimating, how great was his anxiety, re- 
 specting the property, in gold pieces, and moveables, he 
 had entrusted to the charge of his missing follower. 
 
 ^' On this score, I wis," answered Count Rodna, "you 
 may set your mind at rest, sir merchant, (for such was 
 the character, which Vicchy personated) our neighbour- 
 hood is, happily, seldom visited, by those marauding 
 troopers, of the Bloody Peter, which, elsewhere, desolate 
 the land; and the bands of the Cyganis, with whom, 
 truth to say, we are somewhat more troubled, have not 
 been heard of, of late. Your servitor, 1 trow, will join 
 you at Coloswar, so let not his absence occasion you un- 
 easiness." 
 
 Vicchy, who called to mind the bloody garments of 
 his guide, sported like a trophy, by that daring mis- 
 creant, to whose minatory language his ears yet rung, 
 could not exactly reciprocate these anticipations ; but 
 the terrible retaliation, which was in the villain's power, 
 and which he had threatened to execute, should he be im- 
 peached, induced Vicchy, with whatever reluctance, to con- 
 fine his apprehensions, for the present, to his own bosom. 
 Count Rodna, misapprehending the nature of his co- 
 gitation, after a short pause, resumed, " Nay, sir mer- 
 chant," he said, and a quiet smile lighted his noble fea- 
 tures, " we will, nathless, have the country scoured by 
 daybreak, in search of intelligence ; but, prithee," he 
 added, pointing to a sort of refection, which had been 
 prepared, on a side table, " be seated, and partake of 
 such poor cheer, as our buttery can supply."

 " For myself," continued the hareschina*, *' I were loath 
 to break my fast, on a day of mortification, more especially 
 at this season, which I ever set apart to expiate, by bit- 
 ter penance, fatal, and heinous sins, done, sir, in my days 
 of pride, and thoughtlessness, — done — horrible remem- 
 brance !" — and the speaker's voice assumed a tone of 
 deep, and solemn earnestness, — " in opposition to the ex- 
 press commands of Heaven, whose nuncio, the well-be- 
 loved of Jesus, came down, from on high, and, before the 
 assembled congregation, reproached me, for my past 
 transgressions, and warned me, to desist from the crime, 
 I meditated. In the face of the nation, was I solemnly 
 rebuked, and the heaviest malisons were invoked, as the 
 penalty of my future disobedience ! and, oh God ! in 
 the face of the world, by my vain glory, and sacrilegious 
 daring, I reaped, and drew down on my head those ana- 
 themas, which timely humiliation, and repentance, might 
 have averted, and since, an exile, as you see, have 1, for 
 eight-and-twenty years, bewailed, in sackcloth and ashes, 
 my disregard of the apostle, and its direful conse- 
 quence." He ceased, and crossing his arms meekly on 
 his breast, appeared absorbed in thought, for a few mo- 
 ments : while Vicchy was too deeply impressed, with re- 
 verence for his host, to break the silence. It was not 
 long, ere Count Rodna resumed, with more cheerfulness : 
 " I have entered into these details, sir merchant, to ac- 
 count for my barren hospitality. I am sure, you will 
 allow my peculiar obligations, to excuse my absence — 
 but be seated;" and, with these words, the reverend per- 
 sonage withdrew. 
 
 Our traveller had small appetite for the vesper-brod,f 
 provided for him, and shortly after, the seneschal, before- 
 mentioned, attended, to show him his bed-chamber.

 two passed along a corridor, off which, several doors, on

 either side, issued into different chambers. The wind,which 
 had somehow found, or forced, a vent, at the extremity 
 of the passage, rushed by, with such fitful violence, that 
 the light, which was borne, by the domestic, who pre- 
 ceded Hubert, was now, wholly dulled, and anon, flared, 
 with precarious brightness. Once, as the man paused, 
 to shield the flickering taper, a tall figure, wrapped in 
 the habit of a monk, and having an immense leaden cru- 
 cifix, suspended from his girdle, suddenly passed by 
 Vicchy, whose reverted eye was still pursuing the ob- 
 scure shape, as it receded, like a spirit, into the darkness ; 
 when a low, arched door, opening upon the gallery, 
 slowly revolved, and a person, whom he conceived to be 
 Count Rodna, reclosed it, though not, before he caught a 
 glimpse of another individual, kneeling, in the posture of 
 devotion, before a large picture of the Virgin Mary. The 
 gusts of wind having died away, they again pressed for- 
 ward, and presently reached the sleeping apartment, al- 
 lotted to our traveller. 
 
 Left to himself, Vicchy immediately secured the door, 
 so far as two strong bolts permitted, and proceeded to 
 revolve over those events of the past day, which bore 
 down his mind, with the most dismal forebodings. For 
 awhile, he balanced in his thoughts, whether, if, in the 
 course of the next morning, there were no tidings of his 
 guide, he would not disclose to his host the presumptive 
 proof, he thought, he possessed, of the stranger's guilt. 
 Then the vengeance, which had been threatened recurred 
 to him, and the vile calculation, on which the miscreant 
 had acted, assured his safety ; as, of yore, the " vitrea 
 forma" was wont to shield the hunter of the tigress ; * 
 for the poignant idea of the helpless prospects of his 
 child, were he to perish, " puzzled the will," and Hu- 
 
 * To avoid the rage of the tigress, says Pomponius Mela, the hunter 
 would cast before him a mirror. The reflected image, being mistaken for 
 her young, would distract the attention of the parent, et sic ipse (the

 bert's strong resolution to obtain justice, " with this 
 regard, lost the name of action." Presently, worn by 
 the fighting of contrary emotions, our traveller addressed 
 himself to his devotions, and afterwards, threw his wea- 
 ried body, on the bed. The mental agitation, and bodily 
 exertion , which had harassed , and wearied him, for so many 
 hours, soon produced their usual effect, and the train of 
 gloomy ideas, which haunted his mind, subsided in a 
 perturbed repose. 
 
 On his re-appearance, next morning, Vicchy, was 
 greeted, by Count Rodna, with a piece of intelli- 
 gence, which, however he might have apprehended 
 the event, severely afflicted him, owing to its cruel 
 concomitancy, with the total destruction of his fortunes. 
 Persons, who had been out, making inquiries respecting 
 the missing follower of our travellers, had just returned, 
 bearing with them two naked corpses of murdered men. 
 Vicchy, unheedful of the monk, with a leaden cross, who 
 sat near, bent in shuddering, and freezing conviction, over 
 the bodies, and readily identified the person of one, for 
 that of his guide. Count Rodna understood enough of 
 the human heart, to know that grief is, more or less, a 
 sacred thing, let it proceed from what cause it may ; so, 
 in silence, he motioned to the monk, whose presence we 
 before mentioned, and who, tightening his girdle of ropes 
 about his loins, retired, with the venerable host. Sup- 
 porting his elbows, on his knees, with his head bowed 
 down, on his two hands, in a manner that shaded his face, 
 sat the impoverished noble, locked in that attitude of 
 quelled, and speechless dejection, which " whispers the 
 o'erfraught heart, and bids it break." Verily, 'tis an easy 
 thing to read, with indifference, of the misfortunes of our 
 fellow-creatures, besides that, to be " steeped in poverty 
 to the very lips," may not be contemplated, by the youth- 
 ful enthusiast, in that hideous light, in which, a greater 
 experience of the common thoroughfares of life, sooner 
 or later, will instruct him how to regard it. From the spe-

 culative, and the young, the visitation of poverty, in the 
 fulness of his power, may draw down little compassion 
 on the sufferer ; not that their hearts are incapable of 
 sympathy, but because, from the accident of their posi- 
 tion in society, they are, happily, incompetent to estimate 
 the import of the term, or to comprehend its hard, and 
 coarse significance. Knowledge, of whatsoever kind, is 
 vague, and superficial until it he felt ; until, according to 
 the sublime tragedian, * it comes to us by suffering f : 
 and the science of adversity, in all its bearings, can only 
 be adequately appreciated by that man, who has himself 
 gone through its degrading elements. " We must feel, if 
 we would know." May the gentle reader, who, perchance, 
 revels in the wantonness of wealth, never experience 
 those realities, whose horrid apprehension shot icicles, 
 through the heart of Hubert ! May he never graduate in 
 a school, where the knowledge of mankind is the harsh, 
 and miserable lesson to be conned ! May the idea of 
 poverty still associate itself, with classical, and heart- stir- 
 ring recollections ; such as the integrity of Fabricius, the 
 patriotism of Cincinnatus, or the genius of Alfred — and 
 may he never come into close contact, with its rending, 
 and calamitous details ! But really these diverticula X 
 will never do : let us return to our tale. 
 
 Suddenly, Vicchy felt the arms of some one clasp him 
 round the neck, and, roused, by this intimation of her 
 presence, for whose sake, he chiefly regretted, the utter 
 bankruptcy of his means, he raised his head, and beheld 
 Veronica, who had crept to his side, and who now looked up 
 to him, with eyes, whose ethereal sapphire, the very soul of 
 innocence seemed to inhabit. Parting her beautiful hair, 
 on either side of her forehead, he held her from him, for a 
 moment, as he perused, with parental fondness, the ten-

 der, and heavenly expression of the damsel's countenance. 
 Her eyes, upturned, glistened with sensibility, and Vicchy, 
 drawing her fairy form nearer to him, kissed away their 
 moisture, and then, pressing her convulsively to his breast, 
 nature no longer stood rebuked, but vindicated her soft 
 prerogative. The presence of his child, her innocent 
 endearments, smote him, even, like the wand of the holy 
 messenger in the desert, loosening the hidden springs of 
 feeling, and " he wept — he wept !" And oh ! those mo- 
 ments of rapture, when the deep fountains of the sealed - 
 up heart overflow their mounds. Ye know not — ye, 
 who never, in the course of your lives, felt for another's 
 woe, whose beam of prosperity, amidst the night of this 
 evil world, hath never failed you— whose nature is en- 
 crusted under the forms, and habitudes of social selfish- 
 ness — ye know not the luxury of such grief; else, would 
 ye almost barter the insipid common-places of a state of 
 existence, which shuts out all casualty, and woe, for the 
 joys of vicissitude, and change, and quit the dull round of 
 sated wishes, and palled desires, to taste those transports, 
 ^' few and far between," v^^hich charm away adversity. 
 
 " Father, why do you weep, and turn away your face ?" 
 asked Veronica, as the tears coursed one another, down 
 her own pale cheeks. 
 
 '* My dear, henceforth we are pensioners on the casual 
 charity of every passing stranger," sobbed the parent, 
 directing towards her, a look of smothered agony ; " every 
 ducat, I had in the world, was rapt from me, in the storm 
 last night." 
 
 " God's dispensations must be acquiesced in, father, 
 you know ; but never mind being poor, for if you will let 
 me, I will beg for you, and labour for you, and were I a 
 man, I'd fight for you ; but, as it is, o' the long evenings, I 
 will sing, and dance, and never doubt, we will be as 
 merry as crickets, when you will see, how happy I can be 
 in your smiles — if you will but smile — and how good a girl!"

 Vicchy strained the youthful speaker to his heart — 
 " Bless you, love !" he said, in a voice of the keenest 
 anguish, when the child resumed, more confidently — 
 
 " A pin for being- rich ! 'tis being good, makes the heart 
 jovial, which is every thing we need care about. Were we 
 an emperor, joy were all : and being wicked, the emperor 
 tastes it not; so that you see, dear father, the sinful man, 
 set off, with all the trim of his greatness, might well envy 
 the virtuous pauper, though in rags — 'tis just so, and you 
 smile." 
 
 The artless philosophy of his innocent child found its 
 way to the heart of Vicchy; he could not reply, but bent 
 over her, in melting tenderness. Their tears flowed toge- 
 ther, and perhaps those of the father were not altogether 
 tears of sorrow. Somewhat tranquillized, by having 
 yielded to this burst of natural emotion, they sat down to 
 their melancholy meal, which, being discussed, Vicchy 
 was left to his private meditations. '* Yes," thought the 
 fond father, as the door closed, on the obedient child, *' I 
 am still rich in blessings, which outvalue all I've lost, 
 while she is left me ! Heaven forefend that my evil destiny 
 drag her along with it, to ruin !" A tear, he was unable to 
 repress, stole from his eye, and he turned to the window. 
 
 The storm of the preceding evening seemed to have in- 
 creased in violence — the high sounding winds whistled 
 loudly, and mournfully, through the branches of theforest — 
 the dark, red clouds enveloped the face of earth, 
 whilst their sulphureous appearance served to indicate, 
 that the tempest had not yet exhausted itself. 
 
 We should have mentioned, that a message had been 
 conveyed from Count Rodna, during their repast, re- 
 commending Vicchy, and his daughter, not to think, for 
 that day, of exposing themselves, to the rage of the 
 weather. 
 
 Let us draw a veil over the early ebullition of Vicchy's 
 feelings, as he contemplated, in dim perspective, the 
 horrible realities of the future. The state of his mind

 found its apt prototype, in the elementary din, and 
 clang, which, like an ancient chorus, or overture of an 
 opera seria of some master hand, voiced a hollow, and 
 responsive, cadence to the fatal, and mysterious drama, 
 now unfolding, within that retired dwelling, and howled a 
 funeral anthem, over the lost, and last child of the race of 
 Eissenburg. So thought Vicchy, and he might have vented 
 his bitter meditations in the words of Zanga — 
 
 " Rage on ye winds ! burst douds ! and waters roar ! 
 You bear a just resemblance of my fortune, 
 And suit the gloomy habit of my soul.' 
 
 As he stood at the casement, now gazing, unconsciously, 
 at the continuous waterfall, from the eaves of the building, 
 and now, shrinking, at the lightning, as it quivered be- 
 tween the boles, and dripping foliage of the forest; he was 
 startled to behold the figure of his sanguinary guide, emerge, 
 from the shadow of the trees. The accomplished ruffian 
 crossed the drawbridge, and, shortly after, glided, into the 
 apartment. As the door, through which he passed, was 
 behind Vicchy, and he trod, with a soft step, the notice of 
 that unhappy man was solicited, by a slight tap, on the 
 shoulder, ere he was aware of his approach. Vicchy re- 
 coiled involuntarily, as if an adder had stung him, but, 
 recollecting himself, he endeavoured to suppress his 
 natural feelings, whilst the other, without shifting his 
 position, made a slight obeisance, and smiled derisively. 
 
 *' Fellow," demanded Vicchy; *' How came you by those 
 garments, which were my guide's ?" 
 
 *' Egad, my lord duke, you owe me some thanks," 
 answered the man. 
 
 " Thanks, villain ! a halter rather," returned Vicchy. 
 
 *' That were an ungrateful acknowledgment, for having 
 saved your life," observed the stranger. 
 
 *' Saved my life !" repeated Vicchy, contemptuously. 
 
 " Even so," replied the other, taking from his pocket a 
 slip of paper, which he unfolded, and read aloud. It 
 appeared from this, and other documents, fallen into the

 possession of the unknown, that the official, whose faith 
 Vicchy had never distrusted, contemplated betraying the 
 outlawed nobleman, as soon as he had trepanned him, by 
 a pretended ignorance of his rank, into the city of Colos- 
 war. That this man was a confidential agent of the autho- 
 rities, was so clearly evidenced, as not to admit of a doubt. 
 Thus, that very stroke, which had like to have stunned 
 Vicchy, with its sudden infliction, proved a direct inter- 
 vention of Providence, in his favour. Oh ! ever may 
 the pious mind observe, in the blow of adversity, however 
 acute its momentary agony, if not a prominent, at least, 
 a covert blessing ; and where we sometimes fail to recon- 
 cile the mysterious dispensations of Heaven, let us turn 
 an eye of faith, on those chastisements, which may seem 
 unmerited, remembering, that the object of our merciful 
 Father, in taking from the Christian the world, is to give 
 him, himself, and that his ways, concern the trappings and 
 baubles of time, no farther, than these might work out, in 
 joy or sorrow, our everlasting happiness.* 
 
 " However you meant the deed, I must needs own, 
 you are entitled to my thanks," said Vicchy, when, at 
 length, the extremity of his surprise, left him room for 
 speech. "Fill up the measure of the obligation, and 
 restore me the property, committed to the charge of him, 
 whom, it seems, you have murdered and rifled." 
 
 The stranger laughed outright — "■ By Saint Nicholas ! 
 that's a modest request ; and you prefer it with a face, as 
 if it were conscionable. I cannot choose but laugh. Be- 
 cause I have reprieved your life, does it follow, that I am 
 to return you my booty?" 
 
 "What you call your booty," answered Vicchy, some- 
 what angrily, " consists of pieces of gold, and certain 
 moveables, which are mine, do you see, — my property, 
 friend, and"

 *' Not SO fast, my good lord," interrupted the other. 
 *' In the present condition of Erdely, there is a sort of 
 general scramble, during which, men will not wait the 
 sanction of a legal sentence, to seize, what they can lay 
 their hands on. Your property that was, is become 
 mine, by the right of conquest; were the laws enforced, 
 yours, it might scarcely be, pending your outlawry ; 'tis 
 mine, or the state's, at all events." 
 
 Vicchy groaned audibly. 
 
 " Nevertheless," proceeded the man, *' I am of a 
 pitiful disposition, and will do that, which, you may 
 take your oath, the government never would. I will 
 give you back your property, without the mulct of so 
 much, as a single hongree !" The eyes of Vicchy sparkled, 
 with thankfulness, and surprise. " I will," concluded 
 the stranger — ''I will, by G — d I" 
 
 " That hath a better sound," began Vicchy ; '' though, 
 indeed, I can never sufficiently testify " He hesi- 
 tated, and the other seized the moment, to break in. 
 
 *' Don't be too sure of that, my lord duke," he said ; 
 '' there is a trifling boon that, in return, I'd ask of you, 
 which, I flatter myself, you will not think of refusing." 
 
 '* Name it," said Vicchy, " and, if it be within 
 compass of possibility, and the competence of a noble- 
 man, and a good catholic, you may command me." 
 
 '^ Um !" ejaculated the stranger, looking cautiously 
 around him, as he drew, from the innermost folds of his 
 vest, a roll of parchment, which appeared to be closely 
 written over, on one side. The stranger held the broad 
 sheet before him, and, after casting a jealous glance 
 around, was about to read it aloud, when a forked stream 
 of lightning, darting by the window, dimmed his vision. 
 Vicchy shrunk from the lurid flame, whilst the other 
 smiled disdainfully. Again, in a brief second of time, 
 another fierce, and sulphuric flash enveloped earth, and 
 heaven, smashing, into shivers, the gorgeous, and em- 
 blazoned panes, that filled the compartments of the case-

 ment, within whose deep recess they were stationed. 
 The volley of thunder, that directly reverberated along 
 the heavens, shook the building, from its pinnacle to its 
 very basement. A bolt had fallen. Vicchy lay stretched 
 on the ground, while his lip faintly muttered a pater- 
 noster. The weighty armour, suspended over the mantel- 
 piece, was loosened, and fell to the pavement, with a 
 tremendous clash, and the murderer himself was brought 
 down, to the posture of prayer, with his one hand 
 pressed against his forehead, the other, clasping the 
 parchment, he had instinctively thrust, within the bosom 
 of his dress. If his aim was to preserve the instrument, 
 he must have been too slow, or the lightning was too 
 instantaneous, for, the next minute, he started to his 
 feet, and drew forth his hand ; — his eyes rolled from 
 the empty palm to the floor, where lay the blasted rem- 
 nant of the parchment, scorched, — shrivelled to a cinder. 
 It was at that moment that Veronica rushed forward, 
 and threw herself into her father's arms, as he slowly 
 arose from the ground. Amongst others, who, at the 
 same time, crowded into the room, Avas the venerable 
 Count Rodna, who, raising the long spear from the ground , 
 regarded it with a mournful aspect. 
 
 '^ Fell was the dint, which laid thee low, my brave 
 sword! Donald," he added, addressing the seneschal , 
 " bid some one replace these mailed pieces." Tlien, 
 turning to Vicchy, he said, " My experience hath been 
 long and various, sir merchant, but it may not parallel 
 an hour like this ; never, in my memory, did the wrath 
 ful skies so loudly vent their thunder. Trust me, some 
 blot, some foulness in creation, needs cleansing ; yes, 
 there is a cause." 
 
 " What cause ?" said Vicchy, w^ho, occupied with his 
 daughter, was hardly aware he spoke. 
 
 " Crime, sir, crime, that should be searched, and rooted 
 out," returned Count Rodna, with solemn dignity of as- 
 pect ; — and now, the visiting blasts of Heaven are deal- 
 ing with it ; else, why these horrors ?"

 The murderer here half-aiidibly interposed his opinion. 
 " If I might presume to speak," he said, " I should 
 guess, the old gentleman must know best, since perdy, 
 the ground we tread's his own." 
 
 Count Rodna looked at the man, with some surprise, 
 but shortly moved away, to address himself to a tall, ma- 
 jestic-looking person, who, evidently, from his superior 
 habit, and commanding presence, formed no part of the 
 hospitable foreigner's establishment. He, we speak of, 
 stood, for a while, in the doorway, surveying, with search- 
 ing eye, and reserved mien, the characteristic group, whom 
 the general terror had collected together. He now ad- 
 vanced a few steps, into the centre of the apartment, to 
 meet Count Rodna. There was something distingue in 
 the manner of this individual, which was calculated, in 
 no ordinary degree, to arrest, and concentrate all the at- 
 tention of the beholder. Since his character, and for- 
 tunes, will be found to be connected with the mysteries 
 of our story, we must here take leave, in order to clear 
 the subsequent transactions, to describe, as succinctly, as 
 is in our power, his form, and features. We should apo- 
 logize, however, to the rest of the company, and assem- 
 bled household, for leaving them transfixed in their several 
 attitudes, and occupations, as if by the horn of Oberon. 
 
 The personage, in question, was, at the time our story 
 introduces him, of middle age. His dress might well have 
 been worn, by the proudest aristocrat in Hungary ; but 
 the wearer became it, with such dignified ease, as if his 
 vestments were beneath his consideration. The cast of 
 his countenance owned an assumption of lofty superiority, 
 and was indicative of an unbending, and overbearing dis- 
 position, still its expression hardly denoted a bad heart. 
 He was of majestic height, and his port was lordly, and 
 commanding. Every motion, however unconstrained, be- 
 spoke his sense of personal importance. A warrior's, and 
 a statesman's experience, dwelt on the expression of his 
 foreliead. His eye, however, gleamed with a wandering, 
 and unsettled light, expressive of an instable, and vacil-

 lating character. On his brow, at the moment, there was 
 a cast of anxiety ; and his lips were compressed, as in 
 thought. 
 
 " His gathered brow and lips. 
 Wreathed by long scorn, did only sneer, and frown, 
 With hue like that, when some great painter dips 
 His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse." * 
 
 We will detain the narrative no longer. The murderer 
 approached near, and nearer, to where Vicchy was hanging 
 over his child, till he stood beside that nobleman, when 
 seizing his arm, he spake, in a low, though piercing tone. 
 *' Do you know that man?" he inquired. 
 
 ^' Know whom?" demanded Vicchy. The other guard- 
 edly cast a look towards the centre of the room. Vicchy 
 followed slowly, with his eyes, the furtive, but withering- 
 glance of the unknown, till they fell upon the person, with 
 whom Count Rodna had been conversing. As they 
 finally settled there, in a steady gaze, his countenance 
 lighted up, — with recognition. He saw the same man, 
 of whom, the preceding night, he had caught a glimpse, 
 at prayer. Regarding him now, however, with more at- 
 tention, Vicchy recoiled apace, as he recollected that 
 the memorable occasion, on which he had last been in his 
 company, was, when the Princess Beatrice, in the august 
 presence of the ambassador of Solyman, and the mag- 
 nats of Hungary, had solemnly accepted the noble for 
 her affianced husband. 
 
 " Know him! ay, surely ; he is Peter Pereny," answered 
 Vicchy, at the same time falling back, towards the window. 
 "The very individual, whose bride you made away 
 with,'' dryly rejoined the other, still at his elbow. 
 
 "Liar!" hotly ejaculated Vicchy, The loud tone at- 
 tracted the ears of some present; but the strange, and dar- 
 ing character, who had called forth the epithet, had al- 
 ready glided, amongst an adjacent party, who were busily 
 engaged, raising the cumbrous armour to its former sta- 
 tion. Beholding none within the deep embrasure, but

 the father and child, they, who were startled by the ex- 
 clamation, probably imagined they had misapprehended 
 what had been spoken, for the room became soon cleared 
 of all, save Vicchy, Veronica, and that man, who seemed 
 resolved to link some dreadful purpose of his own, with 
 the interests of Eissenburg. 
 
 Again approaching the fated nobleman, " My lord," 
 he said, '' I pass over that ugly word, you cast on me 
 erewhiles, in respect that you know me not. See 
 here," continued the ruffian, as he stooped, and 
 raised, in his hands, the blasted dust of parchment — 
 " What sorry spite of Heaven! — But I tell ye," he con- 
 tinued, raising his eyes, and exalting his voice; "Ye! 
 who wield the thunder! that the virgin bays of courage 
 shall withstand, and laugh to scorn, your danger; and 
 the behests, and fierce pursuit of crowned heads, shall yet 
 be execute, though ye threap ever so stoutly ! — Lord con- 
 stable," proceeded the man, addressing himself to Vicchy, 
 who, with horrified astonishment, regarded him; " unto 
 that indenture, which the silly lightning, as you see, hath 
 incinerated to nothingness, was attached the royal seals 
 and autography of two crowned, and reigning sovereigns, 
 offering a vast reward, in case of certain services being 
 rendered, which were therein stipulated." 
 
 ^' But what have I to do," broke in Vicchy, '^ v/ith this 
 parchment, or its contents ?" 
 
 " You shall hear," returned the ruffian: "Listen to 
 me. Many are the tongues, into which that proclama- 
 tion hath been translated; and few the European states,

 lions of their vassals, ever heard of its existence; but the 
 knowledge of its purport, rolls surely, and secretly, like 
 an under-current, beneath the surface of society, and, 
 despite the elements, would continue to circulate amongst 
 that class unto whom it is directed, did not one of such, 
 this very night, work its predestined will."

 pale, as she clung closer to her father's knee. 
 
 *' Such as I was born, and as thou art become, from 
 circumstances," answered the other, with a grim smile of 
 portentous meaning. Vicchy started, and the ruffian 
 thus proceeded : — "The bandit, the murderer, the out- 
 law, — men, my lord duke, who are the Arabs of civilized 
 society, — the condottierri of Europe! In the Wallachian 
 tents, and the Cyganis' cave, a duplicate of that royal 
 indenture, will be seen posted up, — nailed to the mast of 
 every corsair's galley, it may be read, and let any magnat, 
 between Calpe's cliff, and the flat margin of the Baltic, 
 brave the offended laws, and hold out against the Lord's 
 anointed, and that shrunken warranty shall be met with, 
 on the rebel's festive board, ere the news be a week old. 
 I tell thee, Herezeg of Eissenburg, that, now-a-days, the 
 perusal of that same bit of parchment, is the initiatory 
 rite of half the villains in Christendom." Veronica 
 shook, — a curdling shudder crept through her frame. 
 The damp hand she held, clipped in both hers, she 
 strained convulsively to her lips, whilst her earnest eyes, 
 upturned, watched, with anxious look, the effect of the 
 ruffian's language on her father's countenance. 
 
 " Why this, to me?" demanded Vicchy, at last, with an 
 intonation of voice, which he meant should express his in- 
 dignation, but which, the consciousness of how much, in 
 every way, he was in the villain's power, considerably 
 softened. 
 
 " Because thou art of us," was the daring replication. 
 
 " How, man?" breathed, rather than exclaimed, the 
 magnat. 
 
 *' Lord constable, that wert, erewhiles," rejoined the 
 other, with solemn voice; "you would do well to re- 
 member, that thy shield is battered, pierced, and that 
 thy shrouded ancestry, will start at the trump of doom, ere 
 thou, or thy child, or her children, shall ever rouse them 
 at the herald's call, beneath those centuried, and erst 
 stainless ensigns, which were handed down for thine in

 heritance. Art not outlawed, sir?" Vicchy clasped 
 both hands on his face, and dashing, from the feeble hold 
 of Veronica, who had clung- to him, in intense anxiety, 
 hurriedly paced up and down the chamber. The tempter 
 smiled. 
 
 "Nay, I'd have revenge, were T as you; but now, I 
 would fain give you back your riches," observed the man. 
 Vicchy's hands fell, — his march ceased, and he raised 
 his eyes to the insidious speaker, who thus proceeded : — 
 " Come, shall I conduct you to the spot, where I have 
 secreted your treasures ?" 
 
 " Whither?" inquired Vicchy. 
 
 " Some two miles hence," answ^ered the other ; " come, 
 an your gold be sterHng. I can show you, there, another 
 of these royal proclamations. 'Tis not in the vernacular 
 tongue, though, but writ in choice Cygani, which I will 
 interpret." While the man thus spoke, Vicchy, in some 
 degree, recovered his composure. 
 
 " Do you consider the state of the weather?" he ob- 
 jected, irresolutely. 
 
 " Good, my lord, I sow no danger in my promises," 
 coolly returned the stranger ; " if your mules, horse, and 
 valuables, be not worth a drenching, I have done. I 
 offered fairly." 
 
 *' Man, I will accompany thee," cried Vicchy, after a 
 minute's consideration. 
 
 "Thou wilt not," quickly interposed Veronica, catch- 
 ing her breath, and turning pale, while a sudden tear 
 started to her eye ; "indeed thou wilt, thou must not, 
 father, — he means mischief." The murderer, for the first 
 time, deigned a glance at the child, and then caressing 
 her head with his hand, addressed her, in a gentle voice. 
 "Here, sweetheart," he said, "is a good book, and 
 costly, graced with the name of Veronica, which I 
 found tied to your horse's saddle. Is't thine, my rozsdm?^ 
 If thou canst read it, 'twill edify thee in our absence;"

 and, having handed her the volume, the man withdrew, 
 beckoning- to Vicchy, that he should follow. 
 
 " Be still, my little heart, I shall be back in an hour," 
 said the lost noble, with a convulsive attempt to smile, 
 and imprinting a kiss on the forehead of his child. 
 
 '* Oh, remain where you are !" Veronica exclaimed, 
 with a faint shriek; " the enterprise in which you would 
 engage may be unholy." She looked up — her father 
 had quitted the room ; she walked to the window to 
 watch his receding form, till the dark colours of his ca- 
 pote became blended with the deepening shadows of the 
 wood, and then, as she sunk on her knees, a nameless, and 
 chill presentiment crept to her heart. 
 
 It was in the midst of grief, and terror, the cause of 
 whose vague excess, she could hardly explain to herself, 
 that the book she had continued, unconsciously, holding 
 in her hand, flew open, and her eye lit on these words,— 
 " Come unto me, all ye that are heavy-laden, and I will 
 refresh ye." Young as Veronica was, she had been in- 
 structed to peruse that holy testament, with the like 
 single-minded, and undoubting faith, which, immortalized 
 upon earth, and sanctified unto Heaven, those undaunted 
 apostles of the Reformation, who, in that age, raised 
 their protesting outcry, against the splendid idolatry of 
 the see of Rome; and who, at the stake, sealed their 
 belief, in the sufficiency of Jesus's Gospel to salvation ; 
 showing up to an ignorant, astonished world, side by side, 
 the " false Florizel," and her antitype, and intrepidly 
 arraigning the papal church, almost in the words of 
 Hamlet to his mother — 
 
 " Look here upon this picture, and on this, 
 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers : 
 See what a grace was seated on his brow. 
 This was your husband — look you now what follows : 
 Here is your husband — like a mildewed ear 
 Blasting his wholesome brother — have you eyes 1 
 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed 
 And batten on this moor ]"

 The important privilege of searching the Scriptures 
 was necessarily vindicated, by the very act of separating 
 from the Roman Catholic community. To the exercise 
 of private judgment, every one, according to the funda- 
 mental doctrine of the Reformation, owned an inherent 
 title. But, however incontrovertible in the abstract, this 
 asserted right does not appear to have wrought un- 
 mingled benefit to Christianity. From hence have sprung 
 vip, in every direction, a vile spawn of sectaries, who, 
 distorting the texts, and warping the tenets of holy writ, 
 would accommodate God's word to their own crude, 
 conceited, and even blasphemous opinions — " Chacun 
 s'est fait a soi-meme un tribunal ou il s'est rendu I'arbitre 
 de sa croyance."* 
 
 This persuasion of each individual being both qualified, 
 and entitled to judge for himself, in points of faith, 
 caused the Scriptures, about this period, to be examined, 
 in a fanatical spirit, with a view, either of having pre- 
 conceived dogmas confirmed, or adopting a new creed, 
 instead of their being taken up in that humble frame of 
 mind, which were more rational, and becoming. Not 
 unfrequently, they were resorted to for the superstitious 
 purpose of ascertaining, from the passages which came 
 uppermost, the line of conduct approved by Heaven, in 
 cases of doubt, emergency, or tribulation ; and, in some 
 such mood and temper, our little maiden hied, with de- 
 vout mien, and composed step, to the privacy of her 
 bed-chamber. 
 
 Vicchy, towards evening, returned, alone, from his 
 unwitnessed interview. His daughter, whose ears had 
 long thirsted for the well-known footsteps, flew to wel- 
 come him ; but he repelled her affectionate caresses, with 
 coldness, if not with displeasure. A withering chill came 
 over the spirit of the little girl, as, stifling the choking 
 sob, and checking the rising tear, she silently turned 
 away. Oh ! there is no sting of disappointment,

 treachery, ingratitude, and hopeless love — afflictions 
 which shadow the remote perspective of a child's subse- 
 quent existence, — that will bear comparison with the stab, 
 that strikes home to his young heart, when its affection- 
 ate transports experience that freezing rebuff, ordinary 
 to the thoughtless, and chartered tyranny of his elders, 
 'lis as if drops of frost, each sharper than the sharpest 
 lancet, drizzled over every atom of the naked frame. The 
 antidote against the calamities of riper years, may be 
 found in pride, in religion, in the inborn consciousness 
 of rectitude ; but the outraged feeling, the repressed soli- 
 citude, the crushed affections of the child, canhaveno such 
 orvietan : again, and again, his passionate thoughts will 
 revert, with suicidal aim, to the poignant remembrance ; 
 like the scorpion, that turns upon its own breast, the 
 instrument, that was meant for a protection. Veronica 
 gazed on her father, and instantly discovered, he was no 
 longer the same man — his eyes were glazed — his fea- 
 tures haggard, and care-worn — his cheek bloodless — he 
 looked a walking corpse, rather than a living creature. 
 A second time, Veronica, tremblingly approached him, 
 only to encounter a still sharper repulse. " Ah!" thought 
 the wretched girl, in the simplicity of her innocence; 
 '* God always hardens the heart of such as sort with wicked 
 men, even, as we read, ' he hardened the heart of Pha- 
 raoh,' and this must be what the inspired page referred 
 to. Alas ! that naughty villain, who seduced my father — 
 away with him ! — would, please God ! he had never been 
 born." 
 
 Was this, an ominous foreshadowing on that child's soul, 
 of the unknown's influence on her destiny ? Was it an un- 
 conscious augury ? Could she, indeed, have looked into 
 the bosom of time, what bitter excuse would she have 
 there discerned, for that uncharitable, and prophetic as- 
 piration ! Id fat is videbatur ! 
 
 Darkness came on ; and the tempest, which had not 
 ceased during the entire day, seemed now to summon its 
 whole collected force, — and that was terrible. Out of

 the storm-cloud's bosom the gale sobbed, and the fre- 
 quent, and vivid lightning' flashed, whilst, ever and anon, 
 the thunder spake with an emphasis, as if to astound, 
 both earth, and heaven. A fire had been kindled in one 
 of the smaller chambers, and the bright and crackling 
 faggots, were no unwelcome auxiliary ; combined with 
 the old tapestry, that hung around, and the thick drapery 
 of the doors and windows, they threw over the feelings, 
 that consciousness of comfortable seclusion, to which the 
 insular situation of the chateau, and the rough elements 
 without, imparted an additional charm, by the help of 
 contrast : — 
 
 *' Grato cum sibilat igni 
 
 Molle pyrum et malus auster 
 
 Miscet, cuncta foris, et de super intonat ulmo." * 
 
 Here the proprietor of the mansion was seated on a 
 large leathern chair, in the ample, cavernous chimney- 
 corner, listlessly gazing, v/here the flame flickered 
 brightly against the opposite wainscoat. At a short in- 
 terval, behind his master, stood, in a respectful, and grave 
 posture, Donald, the ancient domestic. At a greater 
 distance, other menials had respectively stationed them- 
 selves, in various easy, or constrained attitudes, according 
 as chance dictated, or custom authorized. On a bench, 
 at a far corner of the room, Vicchy ensconced himself, 
 in dejected meditation. His abstracted mien, his wild, 
 and haggard countenance, in spite of all the artifice of 
 self-command, would have betrayed the agitation, and 
 the disorder of his mind, had he not contrived, in a great 
 measure, to bury his features, in the folds of his attire. 
 Veronica rested on a low tripod, close by, at her father's 
 feet- 
 There was another individual, in that room, unto 
 whom it is likely, the reader may desire an introduction, 
 after being told, that Vicchy, ever and anon, bent on 
 him, askaunt, a mysterious and boding look. He, to

 whom we allude, was an eminently handsome lad, in the 
 first glow, and buoyancy of existence, having curly hair, 
 full, sparkling, blue eyes, lit with intelligence, and be- 
 tokening a noble purpose, and a heroic spirit ; uncom- 
 monly fine teeth, regular features, and olive complexion. 
 He was tall for his years, and the expansion of his chest, 
 and the agile symmetry of his make, were exhibited to 
 advantage, beneath the close vest and tunic of blue velvet, 
 cinctured, by means of a crimson sash, tight to the waist. 
 This lad was commonly styled Sir Sigismund, by the re- 
 tainers of that chateau, though what was his parentage 
 or birth, remained a mystery. He now lay basking on 
 the floor, in the blaze of firelight, having an immense 
 folio displayed before him, with whose highly illuminated 
 page he seemed intently occupied ; not but that, often, for 
 consecutive minutes, he would raise his eyes, and fix 
 them, with a thoughtful tenderness, beyond his years, 
 upon the crackling krumholz,^ which presented ten 
 thousand varieties of landscapes, and histrionic marvels, or 
 whatever else, the poetic feeling of the moment, made up 
 of reverie and sensation, might please to conceive or 
 conjure — 
 
 " And oft before his youthful eyes would run, 
 Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray."t 
 
 For the space of an hour, not a word had passed the 
 lips of any in this apartment, and all had remained nearly 
 stationary, in the respective attitudes, and under the in- 
 fluence of those feelings, we have just described. 
 
 At length. Count Rodna broke the protracted silence. 
 " Methinks," he said, doffing his outer vest, and casting 
 the robe on the back of his seat, '* methinks these blazing 
 brands remind one of an officious jester, 1 have heard 
 tell of, whose wit was admirable in itself, but usually 
 ill-timed. An unseasonable blessing is as little estimated, 
 as the worth of one, fallen from his original estate, whose

 breeding is not merely misinterpreted, but, being viewed 
 through an exclusive, and prejudiced medium, positively 
 contemned." 
 
 Donald sighed audibly; whilst Sigismund, lifting his 
 eyes from off the page, observed ; '' It is not always so — 
 a gem, however poorly set, sparkles the same ; and there 
 are, who can discern, and respect, whatever is beautiful, 
 and grand, even under any peculiarity, or eclipse of ex- 
 ternal circumstances. By the way, would you, dear sir, 
 deign to answer a question, I have long thought of put- 
 ting, and had done, only that the fear of giving offence 
 bridled my tongue ?" 
 
 '' You may not be denied, my boy," replied Count 
 Rodna, gazing on Sigismund, with a quiet approving 
 smile. " Put an hundred an thou wilt. Propose it." 
 
 " That belt, sir I" — and the lad timidly indicated an im- 
 mense iron belt, wliich met, and returned the blaze of the 
 firelight, and which, on Count Rodna's throwing aside 
 his exterior vest, was discovered to circle his waist. The 
 venerable man seemed stung by the interrogatory, into 
 recollection. A slight colour gleamed across his majestic 
 countenance, the whole expression of which, assumed a 
 melancholy character. 
 
 •' This belt, my dear boy," faintly dropped from his 
 lips. 
 
 " If you please — that is, if it be a fair inquiry, I would 
 gladly learn why you invariably, in winter and summer, 
 wear that cumbrous zone? No common cause can have 
 induced you, at your advanced period of life, to submit to 
 so terrible a penance." ' 
 
 '* It was no common cause," said Count Rodna, 
 solemnly, and in a tone more firm than before. He 
 stopped for an instant and then proceeded. " For more 
 than half a century, has this iron belt girded me round, 
 and unto it every year, I add a certain additional weight, 
 in memory of one, to whose violent death I was in some 
 sort accessory. 
 
 " A stranger?" demanded Sigismund, in a low tone.

 " It was my father," replied Count Rodna. " In view- 
 ing this belt," he presently added, " you behold my self-in- 
 flicted punishment." 
 
 The youthful querist listened with rooted attention, 
 whilst his eyes bespoke the deep interest he felt, in the 
 relation of Count Rodna, and his commiseration for the 
 penitent old man ; but he did not speak, while the noble 
 Scot shortly resumed — ''and yet, it was not parricide," he 
 said, — " no ! — these hands never shed blood except in 
 battle-field — but" — he was here interrupted by a deep, 
 and hollow groan : — they started. Veronica passed, with 
 dextrous quickness, between her father, and the general 
 gaze, to conceal his pale, and agonized expression of 
 countenance. It was from him the melancholy sound 
 issued. 
 
 "Are you ill, sir?" inquired one of the troop of 
 menials, standing near to Vicchy, who, raising his head, 
 was in the act of rendering some brief, and probably, 
 evasive answer, when, at that moment, a loud blast, emit- 
 ted from the bugle hanging without the fosse, resounded 
 through the ancient dwelling, and aroused every inha- 
 bitant within its walls. 
 
 And now the storm seemed to rage abroad, with greater 
 violence than ever, and the artillery of Heaven rolled such 
 a dreadful volley through the skies, as to threaten that 
 the building would topple, on the heads of the inmates. 
 Presently, one or two rushed into the apartments, with 
 pale visages, and hair on end, followed by the affrighted 
 janitor, who, in broken and inarticulate speech, gave his 
 master to understand, that some strange person waited 
 without, whose business he could not exactly ascertain. 
 
 " How so, man ? Will he not tell his errand ?" de- 
 manded Count Rodna. 
 
 "He cannot, I fear," answered the domestic; " his ac- 
 cents are too deep, and grave for life — they are unlike any 
 thing human — and his figure, holy Mary save us ! — such a 
 figure!" and the man uplifted the whites of his eyes, and 
 raised his hands on high, in which mute expressions of

 horror, he was countenanced by those, who had preceded 
 him, in his flight from the portal. 
 
 '* Is Peter the Bloody upon us, that you look so terri- 
 fied?" inquired Sir Sigismund,in a low tone, of one of these. 
 
 " 'Tis the incarnate fiend himself," was the communi- 
 cation of the man to his fellows, delivered in a hoarse, 
 breathless whisper. " I could not look upon him, without 
 a palsy in every limb." 
 
 " Some traveller, doubtless, who requires shelter," 
 mildly observed his lord. " Go you, Donald ;" and 
 Count Rodna ceased speaking ; for again a summons, as 
 loud and prolonged as the former, not only reverberated 
 through the passages, and chambers of the vast edifice, 
 but penetrated to the inmost heart of all who heard it. 
 
 The old domestic did not seem much to relish his mis- 
 sion ; he turned horribly pale, but, at the same time, 
 quickened his movements. During his absence, the 
 countenance of every individual in the apartment, save 
 one, reflected the superstitious terror, which was upper- 
 most in their minds. Save one — the guide of Vicchy, who 
 alone, of all that frighted company, appeared as if he felt 
 small concern, in what was going on. His character had 
 no tinge of that visionary superstition, which spread, in 
 those days, a sort of thrilling interest, over the common 
 places, and routine of life. With his eyes, watching the 
 varying expression of Hubert's countenance, and his arms 
 folded together, in composure, he stood, with apparent in- 
 difference, amid the group, untouched, in the remotest de- 
 gree, by that magnetic virtue — sympathy. It was not long, 
 ere Donald re-entered the room, still paler than he quitted 
 it. A bev/ildered expression of mingled horror and 
 amazement had settled on his brow, and he appeared con- 
 siderably agitated. Having come up to his master, his 
 quivering lips refused to form the words, which he at- 
 tempted to utter, in an under tone, and it was with diffi- 
 culty, he made himself understood. 
 
 " How so ?" replied Count Rodna, in a more audible 
 key — "he ivill speak with me, say you? Was this

 message, a message of command to me ? Ha ! to me, 
 Donald ?" 
 
 ** Not altogether a command ; yet his mode of speech, 
 methought, was horribly menacing," answered the other. 
 
 " Is he benighted ? If so, open wide our gates to him, 
 and we will hear what he has to tell us." 
 
 " No," returned Donald, '* his was not the voice of 
 distress, nor the bidding of earthly power ; and, more- 
 over, he declared, he would not cross the moat; and, for 
 the matter of that, God forbid, I say, that his cloven 
 tread w-ere on the sill of any Christian habitation !" 
 
 " Why, Donald," said the venerable Scot, raising him- 
 self from his seat, " what contagious folly is here ? back ! 
 and tell this presumptuous summoner, we will not parley 
 with him, but, if he choose, he can instruct you with his 
 purpose, or pray him to enter. On such a night one's 
 enemy's dog should obtain shelter. Gracious Heavens ! 
 there was a peal to wake the dead ! Obey me, Donald." 
 
 The seneschal, with evident appearance of reluctance, 
 which met an answering expression of sympathy, in the 
 countenance of almost every one present, dragged him- 
 self out of the room. Count Rodna remained in a musino- 
 
 o 
 
 attitude, which none present cared to disturb. The 
 silence of expectancy was over all, and the eager, horri- 
 fied eyes, of every one in the room, were directed to the 
 door, with feverish anxiety. Presently, the ancient fol- 
 lower, manifesting, if possible, still stronger symptoms of 
 consternation, returned. 
 
 " The being insists, — 'tis his own word — on your ap- 
 pearing before him," began the seneschal : " he has that to 
 unfold, "he says, "which brooks neitherotheraudience, nor 
 
 delay : he summons you, by the token that " Donald's 
 
 voice faltered. He crept close beside to his venerable 
 master, who, with considerable dignity, took up the word. 
 
 "Speak out this invocation," he said; "let us all 
 hear !" — but Donald stooped his head, and whispered a 
 few words, in his ear.

 A slight flush suffused the complexion of Count Roclna, 
 which was instantly succeeded, by a deadly paleness. 
 Whatever were his thoughts, he made no reply ; but, 
 on the moment, with a calm and resolved air, he rose, 
 and deliberately withdrew, leaving, on the minds of all, 
 as he closed the door after him, an anxious impression 
 of indefinable awe. He proceeded straight to the outer 
 court. The night was as black as ink ; — but Count 
 Rodna had, with him, a torch, by the aid of whose light, 
 might be faintly descried, on the opposite side of the 
 moat, the gigantic shadow, whose imperative demand 
 had brought him to the spot. He started back, and the 
 torch, falling to the earth, was extinguished; but, 
 nerving himself for the encounter, he again prepared 
 to direct his eyes, towards where the dusky sum- 
 moner stood ! when, immediately, the heavy masses of 
 cloud broke asunder, and one red, and fiery star strug- 
 gled, through the lurid atmosphere. For the first time, 
 that night, the beams of the moon pierced the drifting 
 vapour, and shed a flood of mild lustre, on a little 
 space of green expanse, surrounded by a border of 
 brush, in the midst of which, rose the supernatural 
 appearance. "With what emotions of sublime, and 
 thrilling curiosity, did Count Rodna gaze upon that sta- 
 tionary phantom ! He deemed, that he beheld, stretching 
 itself before him, a kind of shadowy outline, of some 
 vast, immane, and unformed spectre, and his whole 
 frame was held in an attitude of solemn, and awe-struck 
 contemplation. 
 
 '' In God's name ! who, and what art thou ?" he de- 
 manded, in a low and indrawn voice. 
 
 The amorphous phantasm, motioned forth its fleshless 
 
 hand : — 
 
 ''Exile of Scotland!" he began, in accents horribly 
 unearthly ; " you behold the genius of Hungary : I am 
 the same, who, on the eve of Mohacs, would have fore- 
 warned King Lewis of his fate, and so have averted the

 catastrophe of that disastrous day. lam appointed, for 
 a term, to watch over the destinies of this country, 
 whose ruin is, this night, meant to be consummated, by 
 the massacre of vour ffuest." 
 
 "Massacre! — Guest! — Whom?" ejaculated Count 
 Rodna, in a choked and trembling tone. 
 
 " The boy Sigismund," replied the phantom, " con- 
 fided to your care, by Luke Swartz. He must inevit- 
 ably perish, in cold blood, within these three hours, 
 unless the deed be frustrated, by your changing the 
 lad's dormitory, and hiding from every creature, even 
 from himself, where he will lie this night. I adjure you, 
 do this," proceeded the supernatural voice, — " I adjure 
 
 you — 
 
 Bn' him who fell uashrived, unblest. 
 
 Whose painful memory weighs thy breast ! 
 
 Bv the malison of woe, 
 
 Launched on thy head at Linlithgow : 
 
 By the red ruin of Flodden rill, 
 
 1 adjure thee, heed my will ! " 
 
 As the undefined spectre concluded these last words, 
 a blinding flash of lightning darted across the eyes of 
 Count Rodna; — he closed them: — the rending of ele- 
 ments followed, and so loud and continuous was the 
 sounding forth, that, one would have imagined, the 
 arena of our planet; were substituted for the battling of 
 fiends, in lieu of their native element of fire. At length, 
 all was hushed. Count Rodna looked up. The gigantic 
 vision had vanished, along with the moon's transient 
 halo. 
 
 After having, privately, issued directions that, for that 
 night, a translocation of the sleeping chambers of Sigis- 
 mund and Veronica should be effected ; Count Rodna 
 slowly, and wrapt in thought, bent his footsteps to a 
 remote part of the building. He paused, for an instant, 
 before a door, and gently rapped at it. A low and hol- 
 low voice, from within, bade him enter. He passed 
 into the apartment : — it was spacious and lofty. At a

 table, upon which were arranged various papers, and 
 writing materials, was seated that monk, of whom we 
 before made mention. The ecclesiastic rose, and the 
 two, forthwith, proceeded to confer together, respecting 
 a mysterious and important matter, which the reader may 
 learn, in the sequel. 
 
 On the departure of the venerable Scot, the monk re- 
 sumed the avocation, which his visitor had disturbed, 
 and, for upwards of an hour, sedulously applied himself 
 to his writing. At length, throwing aside the pen, he 
 bent his elbow on the table, and, burying his forehead 
 and face, within the palms of his hands, seemed to be ab- 
 sorbed in deep cogitation. 
 
 " 'Tis well," he murmured to himself, half audibly, 
 " 'tis well to be provided against the worst. What if I 
 perish suddenly, a7id without warning? Yes, 'tis best; 
 nor can I too early justify the integrity, on which that 
 poor girl, in all the unsuspiciousness of her enthusiasm, 
 based her unhappy prepossession : — she fell a victim to 
 my imaginary dereliction of honour. Oh ! if it be per- 
 mitted to the just emancipated spirit, to witness what 
 takes place on this Cimmerian globe, let her now look 
 down, in pardon and compassion ! Yet, oh, yet ! I feel 
 our souls shall meet, and sympathize beyond the grave, 
 without the coil and blindness of the flesh, sullying their 
 purity, or darkening their intelligence ; the memory of 
 our fatal intercourse, upon earth, will be the link to 
 bind us together, in immortality. Oh, my dead love! — 
 how loved, I little dreamt, till I sped thee, with a bless- 
 ing, on thy dark way, — if, at last, tliou canst, indeed, 
 read my soul, as thou didst fondly conceive, during thy 
 visionary life-time, to be in thy competence ; vouchsafe 
 to shed a beam of mercy on thy murderer ! — console him, 
 if it be at thy volition, with the thouglit, that thou dost 
 him that justice, at length, from conviction, which, 
 despite of what seemed, to thee, indubitable evidence of 
 his crime, thy faith, begat of immeasureable love, was 
 inclined, whilst thou tarriedst here, to render him.

 Spirit of the departed ! do you know that I am in- 
 nocent ? " 
 
 The soliloquist paused, and dropped his hands, when, 
 by some accidental movement, his elbow struck the 
 lamp from off the table; the light went out, and the 
 pensive habitant of that remote chamber sat alone, 
 and in darkness. He raised his eyes, and a curdling 
 thrill crept through his veins ! for, lo ! the prayer, 
 that, almost silently, had welled up from the sanctuary 
 of his soul, had reached its aim, and had an answer. 
 The far depths of the room became gradually brightened 
 with a glory, not of this world ; and a dim, thin, human, 
 shape, slowly developed its indistinct and shadowy out- 
 line, by insensibly divesting itself, as it were, of one 
 immortal shroud after another, till it stood, pale and 
 confessed, in ethereal repose. 
 
 The dilated orbs of the monk became transfixed, on 
 the apparition, which, by degrees, cleared itself to his 
 sight and sense; and he watched, calm, hueless, and set 
 in immortal beauty, the features of the being, whom, in 
 his rapt musing, he had involuntarily invoked. Awful, 
 and radiant, like that of an angel, shone her counte- 
 nance : she spoke no word, but fixed her stony gaze 
 upon the ecclesiastic, who caught, for a brief second, 
 one celestial smile — a look that could not die; while, 
 upon those pallid lips, yet safe from the outrage of the 
 tomb, there crept a tremulous motion, which, however 
 slight, evanescent, and inaudible, was intelligible, be- 
 yond all articulation. It passed into the beholder's 
 heart, with electric facility, and he saw that his inquiry 
 was answered ; and he knew, and soothing was the in- 
 tuitive consciousness, that all was at length explained ; 
 and, he believed, that the spirit of the departed, with 
 a love, not to be dated or bounded by the pulse's throb, 
 had appeared to intimate to him his acquittal. " It was 
 a moment worthy years;" he bowed his head, — ^and be- 
 hold ! *****

 Another hour elapsed, and Count Rodna repeated his 
 visit to the lonely apartment. He came, accompanied 
 by the boy; they found the monk seated in darkness, 
 his mien was solemn and composed, and his eyes full of 
 tenderness and thought. He made no allusion to the 
 visitation of the phantom. The Scot, having affixed his 
 name to certain papers, that the monk silently presented 
 to him, placed them before his youthful companion, to 
 subscribe after him. The boy received the pen, but 
 paused, as in thought, ere he dipped it in the ink. — He 
 looked his revered protector in the face, and seemed to 
 hesitate. 
 
 '^ Sign, child," said Count Rodna. 
 
 " Sigismund?" inquired the boy. 
 
 '' Of course, Sigismund," replied the count, with some 
 surprise. 
 
 " And what besides, sir?" interrogated the boy, with 
 a meaning emphasis. 
 
 Count Rodna was about to answer, but the monk took 
 up the word — 
 
 *' Sigismund will do: John Sigismund, my brave boy, 
 an you will, — there needs no more." 
 
 " And may I ask, reverend father, without offence, 
 what is the purport of these writings, since they require 
 my signature?" 
 
 '' They are meant to remedy, as far as is now possible, 
 the evil, consequent upon a most base and dark conspi- 
 racy ; and eventually to vindicate the conduct of an in- 
 voluntary abettor thereof, from much misrepresentation, 
 and rescue his name from unmerited obloquy." 
 
 " You speak obscurely, father," said Sigismund ; 
 " nevertheless, I will not refuse to sign, if my grand- 
 father still wishes it." 
 
 " 'Twas for that I brought you hither," said Count 
 Rodna ; " you are more indebted to this holy man, than" 
 
 the monk put his finger to his lip, and as Count 
 
 Rodna paused, the boy had already signed the paper.

 " IwAN Sigismund!" said the father, taking tlie paper 
 in his hands. 
 
 *' Iwan and John are equivalent, you know," remarked 
 the boy, with a smile. 
 
 " True, my son ; though John was, in this case, pre- 
 ferable." 
 
 '' And now attend to me; — what remains to be done, is 
 not to be forgotten. It is 7?iz/ turn to sign ;" and the monk 
 took up the pen, and, after looking at Sigismund, for an 
 instant, with a meaning glance, traced the characters of 
 A NAME upon the paper. When he had done, he handed 
 the inscription to the youth, whose countenance and 
 manner, on beholding what was written, betrayed the 
 extremest astonishment. " This half-hour, I trust, will 
 remain indelibly stamped upon the volume of your brain," 
 presently, observed the monk, in an almost solemn 
 voice; "and when next, my son, you cast eyes upon 
 these three signatures, the obscurity you speak of, will 
 be illumined, and you become cognizant of the purport 
 of these papers; till when, may peace, virtue, and ho- 
 nourable thoughts be with you, in all your ingoings and 
 outcomings !" Shortly afterwards. Count Rodna retired, 
 as he came, bearing Sigismund away with him. 
 
 Veronica, on retiring to her repose, felt a passing sen- 
 sation of wonder, at having to substitute for her previ- 
 ous dormitory, the more commodious and splendid cham- 
 ber, into which she was now shown, by the sedate ma- 
 tron, to whom that duty was assigned, and who, having 
 seen the child into bed, left her to solitude and darkness. 
 The marvellous occurrences of the past day, had con- 
 tributed to relax the mental powers of Veronica, and to 
 render her more than commonly susceptible of visionary 
 influences. The spirit of superstition, indeed, at that 
 " witching hour," darkened over the house, and found, 
 in the thick-coming fancies of its habitants, a meet at- 
 mosphere, wherein to move her " sail-stretched" wings. 
 Every one appeared, more or less, enthralled by the bale-

 ful presence, — nor was tliis vague and involuntary im- 
 pression, without excuse. The untimely, and, as was 
 believed, the supernatural tempest, which had raged, 
 without intermission, for so many hours, and with such 
 intemperate violence, — the frequent, and sulphureous 
 lightnings, which, throughout the day, had illumined the 
 thick vault of Heaven ; the thunderbolt, which that morn- 
 ing had struck the mansion, as if to hurl it to its base, — 
 and rising above all, the visiting phantom, who, so lately, 
 had held mysterious commune with the foreign and un- 
 known proprietor of the domain; — all these causes pre- 
 sented a mighty incentive to shadowy, and imaginary 
 terrors. And what wonder, that a mere child should fail 
 to escape the general contagion ? But, in addition to 
 these unsubstantial impressions, the daughter of Eissen- 
 burg, had to endure feelings of distress, peculiar to her- 
 self. The strange temerity of the man, who had brought 
 them to that temporary residence, his alarming discourse 
 with her father, to which she had listened, with a terrified 
 and absorbed attention; his success in inveigling him, in 
 spite of the element's tempestuous havock, to leave the 
 house — which, child as she was, filled her mind with 
 strong, though indefinite forebodings, — the mysterious 
 conduct, and sullen demeanour of Hubert, since his re- 
 turn ; these were incidents, calculated to debilitate her 
 nerves, even until her shattered faculties lost all confi- 
 dence in their proper strength, and resources. 
 
 It will have been gathered, from many incidental 
 notices, that Veronica was no ordinary child,— her 
 understanding was, indeed, precocious, beyond the usual 
 capacities of her age. Nevertlieless, it should be con- 
 sidered, that the times on which she was cast, were com- 
 paratively unenlightened, and contemporary prejudices 
 tended, of course, to shakle the exercise, and free growth 
 of her natural good sense. Her strong leaning, more- 
 over, to the contemplation of those momentous truths, 
 enforced at the Reformation, and the poetical and pro- 
 phetic garb, in which those truths clothed themselves,

 superinduced a train of thinking, and the lurking in- 
 citements to a practical error, with respect to religion, 
 which, although of a distinct character from the prevail- 
 ing superstition, w^as not less enervating and fatal. 
 
 On this opposite fallacy we have, already, had occasion 
 to animadvert; and it was in that holy, though, if we 
 may so say, somewhat Hebrew spirit, that sublime trust 
 in the omnipresence, and protecting inspiration of her 
 Heavenly Parent, that Veronica breathed, in a soft tone, 
 her extempore and simple supplication to the Deity. 
 The painful impression, which the wonders of the last 
 few hours had wrought on her, she confessed to the ab- 
 stracted and invisible principle, whose element is infini- 
 tude, and she looked for relief and guidance, not to any 
 defined and outward presentment ; she invoked no sen- 
 suous incarnation, no oracular or mediatory semblance, 
 but confided implicitly in the inward, and spiritual work- 
 ings of her soul. Her trust rested in the Supreme of 
 things; in the direct minist'ring of God himself, in her 
 heart. She was slowly, and insensibly detached from 
 this elevation of her nature, by the intervention of certain 
 sounds and appearances, which, for awdiile, had solicited 
 her bodily organs, without arresting her mental con- 
 sciousness. But, however engrossed, her thoughts be- 
 came gradually abstracted from their divine object, and 
 settled on the mortal and immediate interests, that pressed 
 upon her; — these proved, in the event, sufHciently start- 
 ling. A stream of light fell across the bed, upon 
 which Veronica knelt, though not until above a minute 
 after her eyes caught the radiance, did she perceive 
 that it issued through a narrow chink or incisure, 
 which the hand of time had worked, or warped, in the 
 wainscot of her apartment. For an instant, Veronica 
 gazed intently on the opening, and, having slid softly 
 from her lofty couch, she cautiously, and with a beating 
 heart, stole to the aperture. On looking through, she 
 descried the mysterious guide, traversing, with hasty tread.

 the floor of the adjoining chamber. Recoiling with in- 
 stinctive terror, she would fain have averted her eyes ; but 
 a sort of prophetic fascination rivetted her gaze: presently, 
 she observed him adjusting his dress and countenance, 
 at a mirror, which stood opposite ; but it is out of the 
 power of words to depict her amazement, at the magical 
 transformation, which then she witnessed. Throwing 
 aside his grey doublet, the unknown discovered to view, 
 a coat of chain mail beneath. At the same time, the 
 black uncouth patch, which had hitherto defaced half his 
 visa2:e, was vail'd on one side, and she noticed him doff 
 a light flaxen peruke, which had overlaid his natural 
 hyperian curls. The next instant, as he turned away 
 from the glass, her eyes settled on the strikingly hand- 
 some face of one, whose real and juvenile appearance, 
 these adscititious disfigurements had previously ob- 
 scured. Childhood is naturally disposed to rely on the 
 reality of things. 'Tis its high instinct, ere (to use the 
 expression of a great poet) — 
 
 " It forget the glories it hath seen, 
 Of that imperial palace whence it came." 
 
 The first impression of the simple maiden, was, that 
 she beheld the operation, and result of " mighty magic ;" 
 for even conjuration seemed to her m9re credible than 
 deceit. Silly girl ! — and yet in that, as in other mat- 
 ters, " when thou hast more wit," as Juliet's nurse told 
 her, " thou wilt know better." 
 
 We have said, that the face on wliich Veronica now 
 tremblingly gazed was handsome; but it was not so from 
 expression. We have to add, that it was intelligent and 
 commanding ; yet the unknown's was far from being a 
 countenance, on whose lineaments the eye might delight- 
 edly linger. On his desperate brow, in his dark flaming 
 eye, the thoughts and conceptions of precocious crime, 
 already anticipated a portion of those tell-tale, and ter- 
 rible characteristics, more proper to the veteran criminal.

 His features were fixed, in an expression of determined, 
 and ferocious villany. Passion — fatal and indelible 
 passion — was stamped on his front, in appalling tokens. 
 Usually, in the physiognomy of the most depraved, some 
 trait or other, lurks behind, to evidence, that his common 
 humanity hath lent root to some vulnerable point of 
 tenderness; but, about this man, there was no such 
 *' touch of pity." 
 
 *' Monstrum nulla viitute redeniptum." 
 
 At a first view, however, the spirit, which looked forth 
 from his brilliant, and fiery glance, might seem to indicate 
 a lofty, and a generous temperament ; but a deeper insight, 
 into its meaning, would correct the illusion. They were 
 not the aspirings of a noble soul — noble, however erring, 
 which that fierce and violent look betokened ; but, 
 rather, the sanguinary, and self-willed temper of the 
 primal murderer. He seemed a man, capable alike of 
 conceiving, and executing the most audacious deeds. 
 One quality, however, distinguished him, which seldom 
 fails to attract the vulgar, and command their admira- 
 tion, even when accompanied with the allay of a thou- 
 sand crimes, and although therein, the possessor, after 
 all, only shares the common instinct of the wolf, and the 
 hyena. This consisted in that dogged, indomitable cou- 
 rage, in encountering, and address in surmounting diffi- 
 culties, which no object could divert, no danger deter, 
 and which, " if the cracked orbs should split and fall,"* 
 they would not humble. Such was the character, which 
 might be easily gleaned, from a close study of the un- 
 known's countenance, — a character, unreprieved by an 
 atom of principle, and, perhaps, bolstered in its iniquity, 
 by a certain degree of natural talent, and guided and 
 directed, by the appliances of a cultivated mind. If we 
 reflect, for a moment, what tremendous advantage over 
 his fellows, that man possesses, whom Nature hath gifted,

 with a vigorous frame, and a hardy constitution, and who, 
 in the furthering of his selfish schemes, recks neither 
 opinion nor death, nor " the dread of something after 
 death," whom, not even the superstitious misgivings, the 
 Beiartcaijdovia of Paganism, restrains, we may form some 
 idea of tpieir critical situation, whose hard fate had thrown 
 them on the trail of this ruthless ruffian, whether, at 
 first, for enemies or friends, in all probability, in the long 
 run, for victims. 
 
 Veronica had not, as yet, recovered from her amaze- 
 ment, at witnessing this man's metamorphosis, when 
 three or four low taps, on the adjoining chamber-door 
 aroused her. In an instant, les grosses tresses were again 
 collocated over the unknown's black glossy ringlets, and 
 disposed so as to conceal his stern, and polished brow. The 
 immense patch overspread one-half of his countenance, 
 and, instead of the dawn of manhood, which properly 
 distinguished him, his appearance became stamped with 
 an almost senile character. The unknown then pro- 
 ceeded to undo the inside fastening of the door. Ve- 
 ronica could hardly believe her eyes. AVas she awake ? — 
 Why, what could her father want, at midnight, with this 
 man ? If her astonishment was unbounded, her appre- 
 hensions were no less on the alert. She longed to shriek 
 aloud to Vicchy, that the person before him was other 
 than he seemed. But her tongue clave to the roof of 
 her unmoistened mouih. She felt nailed to the spot, 
 where she stood, beholding, as under a nightmare spell, 
 the fate of her dearest sire, evolve, like some mighty 
 drama, but incapable of stretching out a finger, to avert 
 the catastrophe ; — a weight, like that of the Carpa- 
 thians, lay upon, and unnerved her joints. Whilst she 
 continued in this state of entire incertitude, the door was 
 reclosed, and Vicchy slowly advanced into the room. 
 The change which appeared in him was marvellous ; 
 all colour had fled his cheeks, which were of a ghastly 
 whiteness ; his eyes were glazed ; his limbs seemed too

 feeble to sustain their allotted weight ; he trembled ; 
 and, as he threw himself into a chair, his distracted gaze 
 superadded an appearance of wildness, to the haggard 
 care, impressed upon his countenance. 
 
 The unknown commenced the interview, with an ex- 
 pression of impatience. " Wherefore," he demanded, 
 ** droop'st thou now ? Is not the deed, we meditate, an 
 act of justice ? If there be wrong, let those who com- 
 mand the performance, look to it ; — for us, we are but 
 the executioners of majesty; thou saw'st the instrument 
 with thine own eyes, — the imperial arms — the sign 
 manual — would'st thou look again ? I have it yet about 
 me. — See, here," and he drew from his person a roll, 
 similar, in shape and appearance, to the parchment, 
 which the lightning had shrivelled that morn. " Call up 
 your blood again, my lord duke, and gaze," proceeded 
 the stranger, as he held the parchment towards Vicchi, 
 with his left hand. " Ferdinand the First ! ha !" and, at 
 the exclamation, a hollow sound, as of a drum, evidenced 
 the force, with which he struck the fore-finger of his 
 right hand, against the document. '' Charles the Fifth ! 
 do you mark ?" and the dauntless desperado repeated 
 the stroke. " If the emperor, and his brother," he con- 
 tinued, pointing, with his finger, impressively to different 
 parts of the writing, " will scatter their promissory 
 temptations through Europe, 'tis at their own risk. A 
 fraction of the mighty recompence they engage for, will, 
 through the church's charitable alchemy, root out, from 
 our souls, whatever vile excrescence, obedience to their 
 majesties might engraft there. But thou art dumb." 
 
 " Not so," responded Vicchy, in a broken voice, " I was 
 but marvelling what offence either Peter Pereny, or this 
 lad can have committed, against Ferdinand and Charles, 
 that they should join in seeking their lives, with such 
 pertinacity ; or how it can be worth their while, to drain 
 their exchequer for such an object." 
 
 " That concerns us not," replied the other ; '' they,

 doubtless, have their sufficing reasons, or they think so, 
 which comes to the same thing." 
 
 *' Know you no cause ?" asked Vicchy, much in that 
 procrastinating spirit, with which, we recollect, when a 
 child, to have turned from the nauseous drug, we knew, 
 we should have, at last, to swallow. 
 
 " Men say," returned the unknown, " that Pereny 
 played the traitor before Buda, and was the occasion of 
 Roccandolph's defeat, by the lord regent. If so, he well 
 merits his punishment ; though why his life should be 
 pursued so rancorously, is not stated in the proclama- 
 tion, nor do I pretend to conjecture. But we are losing 
 time." 
 
 " Oh, no, we are not," cried Vicchy, eagerly; " while 
 you converse, I forget myself. In pity, talk on. Would 
 you have my aid herein, we must dally awhile ; say any 
 thing, only let me hear your voice. Speak on some in- 
 different matter ; tell me, how it is, that, Pereny is still 
 alive, in the teeth of the deadly will of Ferdinand and 
 Charles. By what means has he eluded their vengeance ?" 
 
 '* By disguise, flight, and keeping out of the way ? 
 The graf would out-do Proteus, yet I will reach his 
 heart, and set my seal upon him. You must know, for 
 a time, he found a fautorer in Solyman ; but the sultan 
 has lately left him to bis shifts, not approving, as the 
 report goes, of his having suffered the princess Beatrice, 
 to slip so easily through his fingers — but you know most 
 about that raptus." 
 
 " A truce, sir, to such insinuations : there's offence in 
 what you say," replied Vicchy, in a tone of austere 
 gravity. 
 
 ''Well, well, as you will ; your cheek hath now the 
 true livery. Oh, how bravely that hasty spark of anger 
 shows in you ! But this gossip is more than idle : have 
 you your weapon ?" 
 
 " It hangs in my room. In the hurry of the moment, 
 I forgot it," answered Vicchy, tremblingly.

 *' That was amiss," observed the other. " Here, take 
 mine, whilst I find my way to the apartment, where we 
 spoke this morning, to seize hold of that jewelled spear, 
 suspended against the wainscot. Now for action." 
 
 *• But leave me a minute's thought, I beg," implored 
 Vicchy, his heart almost failing him ; " perchance, we 
 are wrong." 
 
 " Not a second, man," answered the unknown : ** you 
 allowed, this morning, you had sufficient motives for the 
 deed. I found you apt ; why need I repeat my argu- 
 ment — amazing wealth !" 
 
 "But, ah! the sin," interrupted Vicchy, in atone of 
 nervous emotion ; " the sin !" 
 
 "Pshaw! St. Peter's key is of gold. A trifling pe- 
 nance. Nay, nay, nay ; think rather of your revenge. 
 Pereny, recollect, might have prevented your attainder ; 
 since he, at all events, must have known your innocence. 
 Be of good cheer. Revenge, which the gods were said 
 to begrudge us mortals, and monopolize to themselves. 
 Dost thou still hesitate? 'Sdeath, what wouldst thou 
 have ?" 
 
 Vicchy rose, and walked away. He pressed his hand 
 to his brow. " 'Tis a horrid crime !" he said, shudder- 
 ingly, reseating himself, at the foot of the bed. 
 
 "That will gold remit; but I tell you, 'tis none. 
 Think yourself the executioner of justice, and well fee'd 
 too ; since I swear to thee again, thou shalt have a 
 moiety of the reward. Why dost shake, like a girl in a 
 fever? What a coil is here ! Revenge, wealth, on the one 
 hand; on the other, exposure — death I Rise, Eissenburg, 
 and be a man !" 
 
 " I am both ways lost," cried Vicchy ; " but where," 
 he whispered, " where sleeps the boy ?" 
 
 " In the next chamber," replied the villain. 
 
 " So near !" said the other. 
 
 Ao;-ain he slowly rose, and tottered across the room, 
 seeming to move with difficulty. His face was contorted.

 and there was a shrinking of his body, which not un- 
 aptly represented the strife and loathing within him. 
 After some moments, he abruptly came up to the unknown 
 — " Take back this iron aspic," he cried, in a half scream, 
 *' I cannot slay, where is no resistance." 
 
 '' Then, my lord, will the blackened features, which 
 Veronica loves, become the perch of crows," said the 
 other drily. 
 
 "And better it were so; better my grave were the maw 
 of carrion, than shed innocent blood," rejoined Hubert, 
 with deep feeling. 
 
 "Besides," persisted the young and subtle instigator, 
 without heeding, or perhaps hearing him, " the prophecy 
 of Unna, touching the crown of Hungary, will be of no 
 avail ; its fulfilment being contingent on the death of 
 this boy." Thus glozed the serpent, and Vicchy's reso- 
 lution was shaken. 
 
 " You say right ; so it was. Well, I will cast the gold, 
 at the foot of the altar, and perhaps — " The casuist 
 stopped short. The anticipated possibility of Heaven's 
 pardon, he dared not breathe aloud. — "Only," shortly 
 added the wretched father, " suffer me to awake Vero- 
 nica, that she may be in readiness." 
 
 " Not before the deed be done," objected the other, 
 with a suppressed, and portentous sort of chuckle. " Re- 
 member, one blow, and sure. There must be no death- 
 moan, to alarm the house. Then sever the head clean 
 from the shoulders ; we lose our labour else. I'll deal 
 with Pereny in the same sort. He's in the chapel, doing 
 penance ; he could not die more seasonably for salva- 
 tion. Do you wait on the spot, till T join you." 
 
 " What, all alone with the decapitated trunk !" said 
 Vicchy, with an internal shiver. 
 
 " Tush ! man, I'll warrant 'twill not harm you," re- 
 turned the other. " After having overpowered the war- 
 der, you may arouse your child, and then we have nothing 
 to do but to decamp."

 *' Who has the ordering of the horses ?" inquired 
 Vicchy. 
 
 " Unna," was the reply. *' She is even now without, 
 waiting for us. Are you resolved ?" 
 
 " I think I am," murmured the infatuated man ; while 
 the idea of his fallen condition burned, like living coal 
 in his heart. 
 
 '* That's well," said the unknown. " I go. Mark 
 me — ere two minutes elapse, I reach down the spear 
 from the wall ; in two more, I calculate to arrive at the 
 chapel ; a fifth, and Pereny is a headless corpse. Do 
 you time your movements to mine : courage !" and the 
 dreadful man passed without the chamber. 
 
 How can we dive into the mysterious recesses of the 
 human heart, or how explain the torture, the hesitation, 
 the conflicting passions, which held the mind of Vicchy, 
 '* like to a little kingdom in a state of insurrection !" 
 This instant, his hand compressed his sword's hilt, with 
 the desperate energy of a maniac ; and the next, he cast 
 the weapon from him, with horror and indignation, re- 
 solved to lend a deaf ear to the whisperings of his venal 
 nature, and not to act the hireling bravo, though only 
 thereby he might insure his child a diadem, or " reprieve 
 him from the wrath of greatest justice." In this dubious 
 and tumultuous dilemma, Vicchy 's soul hovered on the 
 verge of the tremendous abyss. In vain, he conjured up 
 every palliative, that he could think of, to quiet tlie indig- 
 nant remonstrances of conscience — in vain, he pleaded 
 hard, that self-preservation left him no choice — in vain, he 
 called to mind the augury of the sybil, and revolved the

 just as applicable, at any rate, to the one sex as to the 
 other ; 'tis, indeed, with some qualification, the condition 
 of tottering humanity ; and he was a traducer, who 
 would have confined the aphorism to the purer half of 
 our species ; but, whether predicated of man or woman, 
 the maxim, like most other apothegms, is stated in terms, 
 much too unqualified. No, 'Uhanks to the human 
 heart, by which we live !" while the scale yet vibrates, 
 even though the fraction of a scruple might incline the 
 balance, our better angel has not abandoned us. There 
 is no calculating on the tenacity, with which strong virtue 
 links itself to our nature, and who shall set bounds to 
 the goodness of God ? 'Tis hard to wrestle with our 
 wish, in opposition to habit, and temptation, and all that 
 the world makes strong ; 'tis harder to come off victori- 
 ous, but it is not impossible ; and whosoever hath made 
 diligent inquiry into human nature, or hath observed the 
 disposition of his own soul — by what springs it is moved, 
 and how it is operated on, and corrected — will readily 
 acknowledge, that he is free to coquet with the evil one, 
 to within a hair's breadth of compliance, and yet ulti- 
 mately hold out ; and so, perhaps, will his virtues come 
 out more refined, and energetic, from the very struggle, 
 which inferred their ruin. Let us, then, hear no more of 
 this bon mot of Roscommon. Alas ! the race of Adam 
 yet inherits too great a portion of the wavering, and in- 
 stability, which characterised our frail progenitors; such 
 a persuasion, as we here protest against, were as bands of 
 iron, round a vicious inclination ; and really, in our opi- 
 nion, only the artifice of the soul's adversary could have 
 passed so insidious a sentiment into a proverb. " Qua 
 nulla pernicies major hominum vitse potuit afferri."* 
 
 A minute had already elapsed, and Vicchy had still to 
 silence the whispering voice within. We have some- 
 where intimated, or meant to do so, that the Hungarian

 noble, might rather be regarded as weak, than unprin- 
 cipled ; and, on finding himself borne along, to the very 
 point of such horrible, and revolting crime, the peril of 
 his position, excited an emotion of horror, vrith which 
 the reader will readily sympathize. It appears wonderful, 
 how the unknown came to trust to the assistance of such 
 a neophyte ; a man, too, possessed of such a wavering 
 disposition, as that, w^hich Vicchy had exhibited ; but 
 having, himself, at a single coup d'essai, " fallen such a 
 pernicious height,"* the accomplished ruffian {repente 
 turpissimus) , might not be aware, by what compunctious, 
 and progressive steps, most men descend iniquity's gra- 
 duated scale. Three minutes went by as a second, and 
 the mind of Vicchy tossed and surged, with the tempest 
 of his emotion. A kind of paralysis came over him, which 
 was the more discomfiting, that he seemed bereaved of 
 all consistent thinking. Over all his ideas, however, one 
 demoniac impulse held tyrant sw^ay, unto which he 
 longed to give the reins, in order to escape from the tor- 
 turing, giddiness, and agony of mind, which resistance, 
 and incertitude occasioned. 
 
 In the meantime, the howling of the storm, never, 
 for an instant, ceased, and it seemed, to the excited 
 mind of Vicchy, that the congregated bolts of Heaven, 
 were beino; hurled ao^ainst the devoted mansion. He 
 clasped his hands together, and, pressing them to his 
 forehead, hid his face upon the bed. Thought with him 
 was stagnant. Even as he lay, thus spell bound, all 
 at once, between the intervals of the crashing elements, 
 a soft sigh vibrated, so close on his ear, that, as it 
 were, he could feel its touch ; he raised his head, and 
 listened — it was not repeated. Shifting his position, 
 he saw that he was alone ; there was no time for surprise, 
 for now he hears a hasty footstep hurrying along the 
 corridor. The gentle suspiration, he had just caught, is 
 " back resounded," and echoed, with an emphasis, such

 as '' hell sighed from all her caves, at the hideous name 
 of Death," what time the abhorred offspring of Sin 
 broke through the torn entrails of his incestuous mother, 
 and with an inflamed visage and distracted gestures, he, 
 that heaved that groan, rushed, breathlessly into the 
 chamber. Vicchy trembled. '' Sceptered damnation ! — 
 we must be betrayed ! — the spear is removed from the 
 wall !" was all that, at first, the passionate villain could 
 utter, through his clenched teeth. His one eye shot fire, 
 and his nostrils were distended, partly, perhaps, with 
 rage, but, also, evidencing the indomitable resolution of 
 his nature. " He shall not escape me this time, notwith- 
 standing !" he cried; "give me my sword again?" 
 Vicchy, only the minute before, had thrown the 
 weapon from him ; he looked for it upon the bed — 
 started — searched the room, but the instrument was not 
 discoverable. The other, whilst he watched his move- 
 ments, reciprocated the astonishment, which could be 
 plainly read in Hubert's countenance. In three words, 
 he was informed of the loss of the sword, though its 
 disappearance could not be accounted for. 
 
 *' Now do you suppose," he replied, " that I'll be 
 fobbed off in this fashion?" and, then, he proceeded to 
 accuse Vicchy, in no measured terms, of practising trea- 
 chery ; the latter rebutted the charge, and vehemently 
 protested his ignorance of how the weapon had been con- 
 veyed away. 
 
 " I must take your word," said the unknown, seeming 
 to check his rising passion ; " since, in the present exi- 
 gence, I have nothing else for it ; but, rely upon this, if 
 you, indeed, play me false, nor time, nor place shall 
 screen you from my vengeance. When you least expect 
 it, at dead of night, I may draw your curtain, or come 
 upon you, in the very heart of rest. Understand, dis-

 Will I prosecute, and obtain revenge." He paused ; and 
 Vicchy, plunged in thought, received this intimation, in 
 moody silence. 
 
 " But your sword hangs in your chamber, you say," re- 
 sumed the ruffian ; '' Wait here — I'll be back, with the 
 grafs head, in a twinkling;" and again the ruthless des- 
 perado quitted the apartment. But not, as in the former 
 instance, did he leave Vicchy a prey to doubt and hor- 
 ror — the removal of the jewelled spear — the unac- 
 countable disappearance of that, with which the ruffian 
 had entrusted him, were startling incidents, which as- 
 sumed all the appearance of a direct interposition from 
 above. Nay, Vicchy viewed these unexpected obstacles, 
 thrown in the way of murder, as an index of the line of 
 conduct, which the emergency required of him. Tt was 
 but the turn of an atom in the scale, but that was 
 enough. The unknown's hasty, and ill-timed insinuation 
 of treachery, and the jarring to which it gave occasion, 
 however momentary, operated, like the sprinkling of cold 
 water on one in a syncope, and renewed the tone and 
 elasticity of Vicchy's mind. Influenced by causes, which 
 he looked upon as little less than miraculous, he felt 
 impelled to save the life of the very youth, who, only a 
 minute before, was within an ace of becoming his victim. 
 With nervous trepidation, he measured the few steps to 
 the entrance of the adjoining chamber, and there stood, 
 half a minute, to recover his self-possession. The room, 
 into which he felt his way, was involved in pitchy dark- 
 ness. Fearing, that the moments were too precious to 
 admit of his now remedying his inadvertence in not 
 having brought with him the lamp, and thinking, at once 
 to awaken Sigismund, and apprize him of the danger, in 
 which he stood of his life, that the lad might seek pro- 
 tection of some of the household, Vicchy immediately 
 advanced forward ; but as he knew neither the size, nor 
 local hindrances of the apartment, he was obliged to 
 grope his way, with a stealthy and ill-assured step. In

 this unnatural, and constrained attitude, he had pro- 
 ceeded a few paces, when his ear caught a faint yell, 
 succeeded by the cries of terror, and the groans of death, 
 which appeared to proceed from a remote part of the 
 building. Then he apprehended that the bloody work 
 was going on, and knew that he had not a moment to lose. 
 "Arise!" he cried, in a vehement whisper, " arise, 
 Sir Sigismund, and save yourself — you will be mur- 
 dered else. What, ho ! — boy up ! and escape while 
 yet you may." He had scarcely spoken these words, 
 when a short and wild shriek, uttered, even within a yard 
 of the spot, he stood on, pierced his senses, followed by 
 a noise, which sounded like the fall of a human being 
 upon the floor. There was something in the cry, pain- 
 fully familiar to him — perhaps his Veronica ; but that 
 was too terrible for belief! and Hubert held his breath — 
 his heart stood still — he remained rooted to the spot, 
 while the cold drops burst out from every pore : 
 
 Oh ! that fear, 
 
 When the heart longs to know what it is death to hear."* 
 
 At the same moment, there were hurryings to and fro — 
 then came shouts and clamour — the clashing of swords 
 and the report of fire arms ; and then, the shrill and 
 soul-harrowing exclamation from a hundred voices, of 
 "murder!" and the thunder pealed, and the vociferation 
 seemed to be reverberated — horrible murder ! — and again, 
 and yet again, below — around — far — near, resounded the 
 cry of " murder! murder ! murder !" — 
 
 so from the body of a single deed, 
 
 A thousand ghastly fears and haunting thoughts proceed."t 
 
 The din of elements, and the human outcry mingled their 
 horrors ; but the uproar within doors was more awful than 
 the raging of the storm. " Murder ! sacrilege ! seize the 
 villain!" resounded from every quarter. The voices ap-

 proaclied. Presently, after a pause in the elemental 
 *' hurly burly," of unusual duration, there succeeded 
 a far louder clap of thunder than any yet, and the light- 
 ning, which glared away the darkness, quivered along 
 the blade of an extended weapon, right before the eyes of 
 Vicchy ; but even louder than the loud thunder, rose the 
 shriek of the raagnat, as his distracted vision glanced on 
 the being, who still upheld that instrument of death, 
 though her form and features, which were worth all the 
 world to him, lay stretched on the floor, all wan and 
 lifeless. 
 
 The next minute darkness returned, and her father 
 raised the inanimate child in his arms, to convey her to 
 the light. His was a vain endeavour, to loosen from her 
 grasp the naked scimitar. Half way between the two 
 rooms, he was compelled to stand on one side, to let pass 
 a crowd of armed domestics, bearing along with them the 
 murderer, disarmed, and bleeding at every pore. His light 
 hair was scorched, and dabbled in gore, and his hands 
 were incarnadine, with the same horrid fluid. Just as the 
 party came up to where the two were stationed, Veronica, 
 with a short convulsive grasp, recovered her conscious- 
 ness ; but, on beholding the blood-stained spectacle of 
 the assassin, she echoed shriek on shriek, with childish 
 reiteration, whilst her father himself was soon incapaci- 
 tated, from his vain attempts at quieting her terrors. 
 "The villain's confederate!" shouted several voices; ''lay 
 hands on him." At the words, the person of Vicchy 
 was forcibly, held captive. To no purpose Veronica 
 vociferated, in a tone of deep emotion, " He is innocent ! he 
 is innocent ! he would have saved Sir Sigismund." Her 
 piercing exclamations rent the air ; but on the air they 
 spent their force — 
 
 her words of flame, 
 
 And mightier looks availed not.'

 All had too good grounds, they believed, wherewith to 
 substantiate the guilt of Vicchy, and, in their first exas- 
 peration, at the crime of the murderer, and bitter joy at 
 his detection, they had no room for sympathy, with his 
 child, and were scarcely in a frame of mind to suspend, or 
 forego their hallowed anger. 
 
 But how felt that wretched man ? As one, from off 
 whose conscience a fearful load has been removed. 
 True, he was in durance, but that very circumstance, 
 by showing him the brink, on which he had stood, 
 made his heart rebound, in gratitude for his redemp- 
 tion. True, he was about to be carried off to imprison- 
 ment on a charge of murder, but he owned the conscious 
 freedom from blood-guiltiness, which he was so near for- 
 feiting, and felt, that the hand of him, who spake the soul 
 into being was upon him — Digitus Dei est hie! 
 
 With w^hat different emotions, and environed by what 
 dreadful circumstances, might he not, at that moment, 
 have been under arrest ! The contrast struck him with 
 awe and gratitude, to think, that his soul was still white. 
 *' HaVd Istennek!^ " he murmured to himself with deep 
 emotion — *' Hal'a Istennek!" With these words, he leant 
 over his daughter, sobbing like a child ; but such tears 
 were sweet, and for the first time, since he had entered that 
 house, Vicchy might be said to be comparatively happy. 
 His state of mind, however, though it has required many 
 words for explanation, and analysis, was condensed into a 
 single emotion, which was, in him, the birth of an instant. 
 The guard of retainers, armed with carabines, and swords, 
 hurried the prisoners forward, into that same refectory, 
 where the venerable Count Rodna had first welcomed 
 Vicchy to the shelter of his hospitable roof. Veronica 
 entered, with the general rush, clinging close to her 
 father's knees. Here the party halted for a moment, for 
 the purpose of having the murderer and his accomplice 
 ironed.

 MANUSCRIPT VII. 327 
 
 The dauntless intrepidity of the youthful assassin, 
 was bottomed on iiiditagelmtoia, that happy decision, and 
 undoubting confidence, in his own powers of mind, in 
 moments of difficulty and danger, which habitual suc- 
 cess is qualified to produce, and which may be consi- 
 dered essential points in the composition of the heroic 
 character. He was fully sensible of his perilous situa- 
 tion, but his spirit, instead of blenching beneath the 
 sudden disaster, expanded to meet the magnitude of the 
 risk, and proved itself equal to the crisis : II pent prendre 
 son parti. Struck to the earth, he yet stood, like a fresh 
 Antseus, and, in the extremity of his fate, his springy 
 spirit rebounded, and made itself triumphant. With a 
 searching eye, he looked about, in what way he might 
 recover his liberty, and the quickness of his genius sug- 
 gested an expedient, which circumstances seemed to 
 favour. Suddenly, and almost at unawares, he extricated 
 his sword-arm, out of the gripe of his right-hand guard, 
 and, as he tripped up the fellow's heels, snatched a cara- 
 bine from his baldric. With the butt-end, he dashed to 
 the ground one near him, who had raised a dagger within 
 a hand's breadth of his bosom. Seized by another as- 
 sailant, he brought the muzzle of the carabine, within an 
 inch of his head, and, firing, shot him dead upon the 
 spot : then, wielding an arm of iron, he either struck 
 down, or shook oflT, the restraint of such as closed around 
 him, and, with a bound, like that of a tiger, clearing 
 the space to where Veronica, trembling and pale, stood, 
 near her father, wrenched the sword, she held, perhaps, 
 unconsciously, out of the child's grasp, and, at once, 
 sprung upon his assailants, with the fury of a hunted 
 lion, among a pack of hounds. All this passed like suc- 
 cessive flashes of the lightning. It happened, that the 
 defence of the domestics was weakened, and their object 
 distracted, by the apparent necessity of maintaining 
 guard over the prisoner, who remained inactive. Pro- 
 fiting by this imperfect resistance, the dauntless villain, 
 nerved with a strength, few men could boast, pressed his

 advantage, with such skill and vigour, that his dismayed 
 opponents recoiled from him on all sides. The greater 
 number of those, who were not disabled, or sent on the 
 pilgrimage of death, were collected, at the upper end of the 
 apartment. As the fray relaxed, carabines were loaded, 
 and discharged at the unconquerable swordsman, but his 
 sweeping movements, and the rapidity of his attacks, 
 mocked the random aim of men, in the confusion of such 
 a scene; though, indeed, he might hardly, much longer, 
 have escaped the detached shot, which whizzed around 
 him, if, from the commencement, he had not ascertained 
 a mode of deliverance, which Heaven itself seemed to 
 open to him. The strife being still at the hottest, he 
 darted off, with the speed and fierceness of a falcon in its 
 stoop, to the opposite side of the apartment. Availing 
 himself of a ledge, which jutted out beneath the window, 
 he caught, gymnastically, with his hand, at one of th& 
 pointed arches, which had resisted the thunderbolt of the 
 preceding day, and, at his clutch, a considerable portion 
 of the shafted casement, worn by time, or else injured by 
 the lightning, fell, inward, with a tremendous crash. 
 In an instant after, his athletic form was seen towerino- 
 in the breach, as in mid air. There, with a hoarse laugh 
 of defiance, he poised himself for a moment, and then, 
 whilst a dozen bullets rattled, impotent, against the 
 mouldering framework, the baffled marksmen might 
 catch the splashing sound without, which told that he 
 had plunged, into the v/aters of the moat. Thus the un- 
 known assured his safety, and his enraged guards, judg- 
 ing it hopeless to endeavour to recapture him, were re- 
 solved, that the remaining delinquent should not likewise 
 effect his escape. For greater security, as handcuffs 
 were not forthcoming, they proceeded to pinion his arms 
 over the elbows, by a strong cord, drawn tight round the 
 body, and carefully knotted behind. While this was 
 being made fast, the door, at the lower end of the room 
 unclosed, and a number of the retainers of the house-

 hold were seen advancing-, in mournful procession, bear- 
 ing the gory corpse of him, who had been murdered, at 
 the foot of the altar. The body was here deposited on 
 the large table, in the middle of the apartment. The 
 eyes of Vicchy were naturally turned to the spot. There 
 stood the monk, whom he had twice before fallen in with 
 beneath that roof, and whom, likewise, he had beheld, 
 under mysterious circumstances, during his absence with, 
 the homicide ; his face, which was overshadowed by his 
 cowl, was gently bent over the corpse, and he appeared 
 absorbed in contemplation of that gory spectacle. Pre- 
 sently, Vicchy's looks encountered those of a man, who 
 stood a short way off, with folded arras and a thoughtful 
 eye. He started. " Merciful powers !" he murmured, 
 '' can it be he ? — Pereny ! — alive and unharmed ! If, 
 if thou art not a mockery, — what cold, stiff, and sense- 
 less clod of earth is that, whose ghastly form lies 
 stretched upon the bloody table ? Whom has the assas- 
 sin sacriJicedV He gazed wildly in the direction of the 
 corpse, but the course of his thoughts was here inter- 
 rupted by the lad Sigismund, who, in uncontrollable agi- 
 tation, threw himself beside the dead body, bursting out 
 in a tone, which went through the hearts of all present — 
 " My more than father, dost thou lie there, weltering 
 in thy blood ? Let me mingle my tears with the precious 
 current — and is grief then all the incense, thy bleeding 
 corpse should obtain ? Alas ! I have none else ; but a 
 day may come — yes, a day may come, when thy ashes 
 shall be bedewed, and thy spirit appeased, with manlier 
 offerings, and yet this blood may call down retribution ; 
 till when, the curse of Cain be on thy murderer I and, be 
 this my memory." Saying these words, he tore off the 
 corner of a light silken scarf, from the waist of the mur- 
 dered man, and pressing it in the ensanguined die, thus 
 subjoined, in a more solemn tone : *' I vow, through all 
 time, and all change, to bear this property about me, till 
 hereafter, I come across the author of this butchery !

 when I will steep it in his heart's best blood ; so help 
 me God, at my need, as I fulfil my engagement, and ex- 
 piate thy death — friend, protector, cherisher of the 
 friendless orphan !" and the boy, placing the shred 
 within his vest, fell, weeping, on the floor. 
 
 A piteous exclamation, or yell of deep grief, burst 
 from the assembled retainers of the murdered count, 
 which, presently, gave place to the graver lament of 
 Pereny, who, deeply moved, bent over the body. " And 
 art thou gone before me, my friend ? — exile of Caledo- 
 nia 1 Hath thy long pilgrimage closed at last, in blood ? 
 Whom have I now to speak to, of the glory and 
 shame of the past, the horrors of the present, or the 
 chances of the future ? In whose sympathising ear shall 
 I confide my misfortunes ? Thou couldst, indeed, feel 
 for the Hungarian magnat ; for as our fate was not dissi- 
 milar, so our woes were the same ; thou readest my grief 
 in thine own heart. Oh ! would to God, I were laid be- 
 side thee, my last, my only friend !" Vicchy heard no 
 more, for now he, and his daughter were withdrawn from 
 the apartment.

 familiarity), may I ask, by whose agency the jewelled 
 spear came to be removed away so opportunely, from 
 where it was slung, over the chimney-piece? — Answer. 
 By that of Veronica, who, having overheard the dis- 
 guised homicide signify his intention of using it, in the 
 deed he meditated, hit upon that mode of frustrating his 
 designs. Impelled, by that fearless decision, we love to 
 recognise in her character, after hurriedly slipping on 
 some light body-dress, she stole, on tiptoe, with a beat- 
 ing heart, and a cheek, pale at her own purpose, into the 
 salle-d-maiigeVj and carried the sword thence, into her 
 own chamber. 
 
 The Reader. — Prodigious ! a fine child of her years, 
 truly ! — and this occurred in the dark ? Did she jump at 
 it, or pray did the weapon, like an autumnal fruit, drop 
 into her lap of its own volition ? — Answer. My fair critic 
 is pleased to be facetious ; but the sword, in question, bore 
 no resemblance to those spears of Mars,* cited by Julius 
 Obsequens ; and, besides, Veronica did not work in the 
 dark. She luckily remembered observing, in the room, 
 where, on the preceding evening, the several members 
 of the household had congregated, more than one lamp 
 on a side-table. This room happened to branch off from 
 the gallery, midway between her own chamber, and the 
 refectory. Thither, in the first instance, with light and 
 quick steps, she necessarily repaired. As a feeble blaze 
 yet glimmered, in the hearth, she found no difficulty in 
 obtaining a light, which, of course, facilitated her sub- 
 sequent operations. 
 
 Now, we are ready to acknowledge, that the sword 
 came into her possession, by a sadly common-place pro- 
 cess, although we are in our fair critic's judgment, whe- 
 ther it was not one, which, under the circumstances, was 
 perfectly natural. She raised herself within reach of 
 the weapon, by mounting a table.

 The Reader. — Quite an exploit! — and I suppose we 
 are to ascribe, to the same officious little lady, the 
 purloining of the other sword ? — Answer, 
 
 The conjecture does credit to your discernment, madam : 
 she had not returned to her room, above a minute, ere the 
 stranger quitted her father. We need scarcely remark 
 on the state of exaltation, to which the mind of Vero- 
 nica was wrought. She had been governed by an almost 
 preternatural impulse, in venturing on the bold feat, she 
 had just accomplished, and the excitation of her spirits, 
 which bore her successfully, through so arduous an ad- 
 venture, had not yet subsided. 
 
 The reader may object, perhaps, the incompatibility 
 of the incident, we have recorded, with the fewness of the 
 years of Veronica. With the pride, which custom autho- 
 rizes, and which originally takes its rise from his phy- 
 sical superiority, although that be often the only advan- 
 tage he can claim, the adult looks down, from his fancied 
 height, on the inexperience of the child, and is apt to 
 believe his nature too unripe, to put forth those mental 
 resources, in moments of extremity, which even manhood, 
 not seldom, fails to exhibit. How far this presumption 
 of juvenile incapacity may have a certain coincidence 
 with the fact, from its tendency, like prophecy, to lend 
 a helping hand to its own fulfilment, we are not pre- 
 pared to say ; but we know, that examples occasionally 
 occur, at that immature period, of the simultaneous con- 
 ceptiouj and execution, of extraordinary deeds, depend- 
 ing, for their fortunate issue, on the native energy, and 
 courage of the actor, which w^ould not discredit the sus- 
 tained and habitual character of riper years. 
 
 Veronica, with shame and agony, apprehended, that 
 her father had been deluded, by the sophistry of the 
 unknown. She shuddered at the thought, even as his 
 better angel, in such a straight, might be supposed to

 dreadful purpose would lead him into the bed-chamber, 
 she then occupied. Whom he meant to assassinate, she 
 could not guess, nor, indeed, could her mind easily 
 admit the possibility of such a crime ; but her good ge- 
 nius, stimulated by filial love, and fertile in expedients, 
 as it first prompted her to frustrate the villany of the 
 ruffian, so it afterwards inspired her, with like resolution, 
 to disarm her father. Having witnessed the unconscious 
 movement, with which Vicchy tossed the weapon upon the 
 bed, she took advantage of his abstraction, to stealthily 
 trip along the floor of the room, and steal away the in- 
 strument. Then she awaited the event, in a state of 
 wretchedness, which only those can conceive, who, like 
 her, have had to weep over the frailty of a parent. 
 What was her consternation, when she found Hubert 
 pass, from the adjacent chamber, into hers! The child 
 could not conjecture his object; she stood, speechless 
 with affright, racked, by the double agony of terror and 
 suspense. But, when she gleaned from his words, that, 
 far from meditating evil, her father had come, in fact, 
 with the view to warn Sir Sigismund of his danger, 
 the sudden conviction struck her, that she had all 
 along misapprehended his purpose. The ecstatic joy 
 of which idea, caused that revulsion of spirits, the effect 
 of which we have elsewhere described. 
 
 Have you, my fair critic, any further inquiry to put ? 
 
 The Reader. — Oh, a dozen. Pray, how happened " the 
 great unknown" to blunder so egregiously as to kill one 
 man for another ? Was it not the villain's design solely 
 to compass the death of Pereny ? I admit, his homicidal 
 nature might discover, in the reward offered, a sufficient 
 temptation to commit that crime, and, perhaps, (such a 
 microscopic eye is villany cursed with,) he might descry 
 some justification, in the alleged treason of his victim. 
 But why make a merit with Satan, by slaying Count 
 Rodna ? What " stoned his heart," that he should " do 
 a murder," when he merely intended " a sacrifice ?" —

 Author. My dear young lady, you are really excru- 
 ciating ; you do run on so. If you will only allow us to 
 edge in a syllable, we believe we can clear up this point 
 to your satisfaction. The unknown, in the course of his 
 inquiries respecting the topography of the chateau, had 
 ascertained, amongst other particulars, that the graf 
 Pereny was in the habit of spending the greater part of 
 the night in the private chapel, which was appended to 
 the mansion. One portal of this consecrated building was 
 fantastically carved and heavy, and, withal, so dilapi- 
 dated by time, and overgrown with speckled lichen, 
 that it might not wholly close, though continually 
 flapping, in the wind, against its frame. This entrance, 
 from the internal quadrangle, was indiscriminately used 
 by the v.hole household. Happening to pass, on the 
 previous night, the stranger had remarked a man, kneel- 
 ing before an opposite shrine, and hence, he concluded, 
 with too great precipitance, that this individual could be 
 no other, than his destined victim. 
 
 The body of the chapel was usually appropriated to 
 the religious worship of the ol ttoWoi ; thence, a few stairs 
 led into a narrow, small oratory, sanctified by containing 
 a painting of the Virgin, reported to possess sundry mi- 
 raculous properties. Here a private door opened into 
 the interior of the mansion, and directly communicated 
 with the gallery. It was through this door, that Vicchy 
 (as he and Donald traversed the lobby) beheld Pereny 
 in the act of genuflection, before the shrine of Our Lady. 
 The unknown, having armed himself with Vicchy's sword, 
 cautiously crossed the narrow court, and glided into the 
 chapel, through the open door. As if he trod upon 
 trembling ice, he measured the trifling distance, from the 
 entrance of the oratory to the holy crypt, where the pious 
 votary, with riveted eye, and abased mien, seemed em- 
 bodied with the flag-pavement, on which he knelt. The 
 light of one long waxen taper, which twinkled before the 
 crucifix, struggled through the misty atmosphere of the

 chapel, and shed a faint, yet direct gleam, on the bent 
 head of the crouching worshipper. Owing to that deep 
 posture of humiliation, it was impossible to distinguish 
 his form and features ; but, acting on his previous mis- 
 conception, the wily ruffian shortly stood right over the 
 solitary suppliant. 
 
 " Hold !" thundered a single voice in his ear. It 
 came, alas ! too late. Count Rodna, in the same in- 
 stant, fell, pierced to the heart, and, in the next, the 
 sword of Donald was struck from his palsied hand. 
 At that moment, Pereny rushed from the gallery, and 
 the retainers of the mansion crowded into the chapel, 
 by the way, which had given admittance to the as- 
 sassin. 
 
 In consequence of the mysterious intimation of the 
 phantom. Count Rodna had directed his household, to 
 hold themselves under arms during the night ; and Do- 
 nald, who had been the bearer of his master's orders, 
 directly afterwards, (owing to a private misgiving, which, 
 however indefinite, he thought he had cause to entertain,) 
 set himself to watch the chamber-door of Hubert. It 
 was closed, and he knew not the room was empty. He 
 had not lain long perdu, ere, to his surprise, he beheld 
 the unknown enter the apartment, and presently after, 
 observed him issue forth, armed with a naked sword. 
 With vague apprehensions floating on his mind, Donald 
 followed the steps of the villain, as closely as his age 
 and infirmities permitted ; but came up too tarddy to 
 prevent a catastrophe, which he could not have fore- 
 boded. His exclamations drew many of the household 
 into the chapel, with drawn rapiers, and looks of venge- 
 ance. 
 
 '' Oh ! my dear, dear master," murmured the dying se- 
 neschal — then upbraidingly fixing his eyes on the tru- 
 culent assassin, he proceeded, in feebler accents — 
 " Murderer ! you have slain the ."

 his throat," and the next minute he gave up his soul to 
 his Creator. 
 
 Meantime, the assassin encountered the attacks of the 
 multitude with his natural bravery : more than one of his 
 foes fell beneath his rapid strokes, whilst several were 
 maimed for life ; and it became doubtful, at one time, 
 how the contest would terminate; when, suddenly, the 
 sword of Vicchy snapped at the hilt, and although the 
 unknown, with only his long dirk, kept his assailants at 
 bay for a short period, he soon after offered to surrender. 
 The rest we have already told. q. e. d. 
 
 I see the gentle reader is prepared with another diffi- 
 culty. Let her, in as few words as may accord with the 
 privilege of her eloquent sex, start it, and we will S3t 
 about working the problem, without that minuteness of 
 detail, which were incompatible with the subordinate 
 place, which should belong to this episode, in tlie general 
 design of our history. 
 
 The Reader. — You are too polite by half, sir. Whi- 
 ther, then, did the " great unknown" lead Vicchy, when 
 the two set forth on their ramble, " in thunder, lightning, 
 and in rain ?" 
 
 Author. — Hearken, my dear. The pair soon lost 
 sight of the chateau : Vicchy exerted himself to keep up 
 with the swift, and steady pace of his terrible conductor, 
 almost mechanically ; whilst, breaking his path, through 
 bush and bramble, the villain led the way, in a zig-zag 
 and involved course, as if rather with the view of bewil- 
 dering his belated follower, amidst the intricacies of the 
 forest, than pursuing any certain direction. After walk- 
 ing, with extreme haste, for the space of an hour, the 
 unknown, suddenly, struck out of the woody depths, into 
 a very rugged, narrow footway, hemmed in between two 
 consistencies of mud and hedge, which bore all the cha- 
 racter of a steep, dirty lane, or rather gully. This 
 brought them, at length, before a natural insulated pro- 
 jection of rock, or stratified schist, impending in sharp

 ridges, some few feet over the surface of a large dell, 
 and crowned by the frail flowers of the white saxifrage. 
 Within, was excavated a vast cavern, whose entrance, in 
 other respects hardly accessible, was, besides, effectually 
 screened from all chance-discovery, by the thicknesses 
 of myrtle, bramble, and dog-rose, which, springing from 
 the light stratum between the shelving of the rock, clus- 
 tered around, and there gave out their odours. These, 
 it seemed, being held in on one side, indicated two or 
 three narrow, and precarious steps of mica slate, which 
 descended through the jaws of the cave. It was neces- 
 sary to use a creeping posture, in order to find ingress, 
 and Vicchy, as he followed his leader through the com- 
 plicated foliage, and backed into the passage, though a 
 brave man, had some secret misgivings, which he would 
 willingly have hidden from himself, if the increased 
 throbbing of his heart had let him. Stifling, however, 
 his apprehensions, by an exertion which he deemed intre- 
 pidity, though it was nothing but winking cowardice, he 
 continued to descend, when, after a few yards, the width 
 of the gulf suddenly expanding, he was able to assume 
 an erect posture, and found himself standing in a roomy 
 cavern, the dimensions of which were lost, in customary 
 darkness. The veins of quartz, apparently imbedded 
 around, assumed, for a few paces, an almost argentine 
 character, owing to the red day-light glow, which, like a 
 fire of naphtha, at first, irradiated the mouth of the 
 cavern, though it rapidly faded into the Cimmerian 
 gloom, that wrapt the boundaries of the interior. Hubert 
 found the atmosphere neither so confined nor chill, as 
 might have been expected ; the free, and wholesome air 
 having vent, through some natural spiracles in the rock. 
 To such dark and dreary solitude, and shelter, as this 
 place afforded, his associate, having first promised, that 
 he would speedily be back, without further apology, left 
 Vicchy. The ruffian turned an angle at one extremity 
 of the subterraneous chamber, where, directly beyond a

 lamellated mass of rock, there was a narrow outlet, 
 opening, probably, into the more profound recesses of 
 the natural mansion. Vicchy seated himself on a large 
 stone, at some distance from the entrance, and in no 
 enviable frame of mind, awaited the issue of this strange 
 adventure. But, whatever were his meditations, he was 
 not suffered to brood over them long. They were inter • 
 rupted, by the apparition of a tall shape, darkening the 
 mouth of the chasm, whose outline, although strongly 
 defined in the light, was all that the deep obscurity 
 within would allow him to distinguish. Vicchy did not 
 stir, and, presently, the form glided away, and was lost 
 in the receding umbrage of the vault. 
 
 With that sort of desperate courage, which is not un- 
 allied to fear, Vicchy instantly rose, and proceeded for- 
 wards, with his arms outstretched, in the direction, which 
 the feeble echo of receding footsteps pointed out. In 
 this manner, trusting, solely, to the sense of hearing, 
 Vicchy explored several paces, when, suddenly, his ex- 
 tended waist was clipped, with a powerful pressure, by 
 cold clammy fingers, and a voice, singularly hollow and 
 sepulchral, whispered in his ear, "This is your way; 
 make no resistance, but come with me." With the un- 
 stable feeling of one in a dream, Hubert was led along 
 several winding passages, in the midst of darkness, so 
 substantial, that, in the emphatic phrase of scripture, it 
 might be said to be '^ felt." All at once, a dim ray of 
 light glimmered through' a narrow slit or loop-hole, in 
 the ruinous sides of the cavern, and here they stopped 
 short. At that moment, he heard, near him, the tremu- 
 lous moan of one in prayer or agony. Having cautiously 
 removed, with its lank fingers, a piece of earth, loosely 
 inserted in a fissure of the rock, the dubious figure, in a 
 low mysterious voice, directed Hubert to gaze in at the 
 crevice ; he obeyed, and beheld a small chamber, some- 
 what irregular in shape, and duskily lighted. It was 
 rude and desolate, and afibrded small appearance of ac-

 commodation. The walls were hewn out of the same 
 testaceous strata, which distinguished the entire cave, 
 and, like the ceiling, were thickly coated, with the stifling 
 smoke of centuries, which, after circling through the 
 apartment, was wont to escape, with difficulty, through 
 some fissure, or disruption of the roof. In a further 
 corner, was a dull charcoal fire, whose fluttering flame 
 painted the earthy walls, with intermitting hues, and dif- 
 fused around, the wierdlike gloom of glowing embers. A 
 few chairs, a table, and a wooden bench, lay about '' in 
 admired disorder." 
 
 On one side, stood a miserable pallet, over and about 
 which, a tattered coverlet hung, by way of curtain, — but 
 what pale blighted form lies stretched within that wretched 
 couch ? her blue eyes turned upwards, and a single auburn 
 ringlet on her shoulder. On whose ashy countenance, 
 even now convulsed with the last mortal agony, does the 
 low flame throw its wavering light ? It is that of a wo- 
 man, still young — and once how beautiful ! whom Vicchy 
 well remembered to have seen in other days, and under 
 
 happier auspices. And that other, he, who, seated 
 
 on a chair by the bedside, leans, anxiously, but with face 
 averted, and posture fixed, as in mockery of monumental 
 stone, over the form of the shrived penitent, — athwart, 
 what brow is thrown that dark habit ? What is he, who, 
 uplifting a leaden cross, is even now hearkening to the 
 last faint words of her, whose soul he had just " cleansed 
 of that perilous stuff", which weighs upon the heart?" 
 
 " And still the crucifix on high 
 He holds before the darkening eye, 
 And still he bends an anxious ear. 
 The faltering penitence to hear."*

 pierce his ear, the vehement and convulsive play of his 
 fingers on the roll, seem to evince his sympathy, with the 
 dying sufferer. 
 
 Father, said the female, in feeble and broken accents, 
 *' Let me implore you, by that salvation you pledged, to 
 remember your promise, that those papers be not opened 
 during the reign of the regent Martinuzzi. They evi- 
 dence the tragic story of my confession, and detail, how 
 i became an accomplice in that crime, of which, through 
 the blood of Jesus, I stand this hour assoiled." 
 
 The obscure figure beside him, at that moment, 
 plucked Vicchy by his mantle, as if to request his at- 
 tention, and then lifted up its voice. 
 
 " Eissenburg," she whispered, but in tones so low 
 and unearthly, that they added to the solemnity of her 
 speech, in the darkness of that vault, — " Eissenberg, I 
 bid thee now bear witness, she has said it, — that packet 
 holds the destinies of Hungary. One day, I may have 
 to command you to declare, before the world, the par- 
 ticulars of the death-bed of : that woman — listen ! 
 
 she speaks again." — " One thing more I'd fain mention, 
 before the world roll utterly away from my affections," 
 resumed the gasping female ; but her speech was so in- 
 terrupted, with the hard sobs of mortal strife, that it 
 was with difficulty Vicchy could catch its purport. 
 " Once," she proceeded, " in my sore agony, — it was in 
 my madness, — I cursed that man. Him — the cause of 
 all — my fatal fall, my anguish, and of this mighty crime, 
 charactered in that paper, and which, erewhiles, I 
 spake of." 
 
 " But thou recallest thy malison," cried the ghostly 
 confessor, with strong inward emotion, bending closer 
 over the low couch of the wrestling soul. 
 
 " Recall it, father ! " faltered out the female, raising 
 herself for an instant, with expiring strength; "recall

 it! Oh ! would to God, that he were there, where thou 
 sittest, that he might know, and receive the last aspira- 
 tion of my living voice ! " 
 
 The head of the monk was still depressed; — with 
 trembling hand, whilst every fibre of his frame seemed 
 convulsed, he raised his cowl, and gave one look, and 
 uttered one little word, but in so choked and indrawn 
 an accent, that Hubert could not hear it. A languid 
 colour reddened the female's cheek, she faintly screamed, 
 and, through the darkening film of death, her sunken 
 eye sought out the face of him, who sustained, and bent, 
 scarce breathing, over her. 
 
 As, sometimes, for an instant, the last rim of the 
 horizontal luminary will gild, with burnished radiance, 
 the disparting clouds, ere they finally reclose to cover 
 him with their pall ; like such transient sunburst, flashed 
 the light of recognition across that dying female's brow. 
 Striving to draw her last convulsive breaths, and con- 
 centrating all her strength, in a final effort, she threw 
 her arms around the confessor's neck. 
 
 " the breath, 
 
 Revisited those lips, and life's pale light, 
 Flashed through those limbs." * 
 
 " Not — not deserted ! in death, mine own ! God 
 bless thee! mine in heaven!" she ceased, and, softly 
 sighing, pillowed her head on his shoulder. 
 
 Was she no more ? The monk gazed madly : — 
 " Dear Alicia," he murmured, " can it be ?" 
 
 Her eye grew dim : it fixed, it closed ; but her lip yet 
 inaudibly quivers. Alas ! the bland and beautiful ex- 
 pression was but the sign of a devotedness, that could 
 not die; — the triumph, the victory of that love, which

 makes the soul of woman, over the body's dissolution. 
 The monk gave one deep groan, loosed himself from the 
 locked embrace of the yet warm corpse, and, clasping 
 his hands convulsively above his head, fell back, in a 
 kind of trance, upon the motionless pillow. 
 
 Oh, thou disturbing spirit of love ! that art painted a 
 child, and yet we borrow from thee all our strength ; 
 thou art feigned blind, and yet our best sight is derived 
 from thy inspiration ! Were we wise, methinks, the 
 terrors of thy archery should strike our nerves, not less 
 than thunder : thou brewest a nectar, whose exquisite 
 taste maketh humanity divine, and then dashest poison 
 into the Nepenthe ; 
 
 " To ope new veins of torture in the soul, 
 And wake the nerve where agony is born." * 
 
 Thou, indeed, knowest the marvellous of pain; but, 
 though thy w^ays are ways of trouble, and despair, what 
 were this world, without thy witcheries ? 
 
 Vicchy's attention was so fully occupied, with the 
 scene we have attempted to describe, that the being who 
 stood by his side, had occasion, more than once, to 
 pluck him by the sleeve, ere he recollected himself, and 
 called to mind where he was, and how he came thither. 
 He was then conducted into another cell ; for, it ap- 
 peared, that this subterranean cavity had been subdi- 
 vided, either naturally or artificially, to answer the pur- 
 poses of many apartments. Here, his companion, stop- 
 ping short, suddenly addressed him : — 
 
 '' Do you remember me, sir Herezeg?"t 
 
 *' How should I ?" returned Vicchy ; "I can see no- 
 thing." 
 
 "Ha!" replied the figure, "I forgot myself. From 
 this vacant dome, where flames the topaz, and the fre-

 quent sapphire beams forth serene, like angel eyes ; 
 where glow the empurpled amethyst, beryls almost ceru- 
 lean, and jasper, bright as the spear-grass, near the 
 ebbing wave ; gems, yet virgin of the sun, and such as 
 rarely chance to deck the pomp of courts, emit their 
 restless splendour in eclipse. This dim twilight, which, 
 by long practice, gives me to behold, with distinctness, 
 each opening of the cave, or shelving rock, spangled 
 with pearls of dew, and every choicest stone, or spark- 
 ling fossil, that veins its walls, but never stole a charm 
 of light, or colour, from the day, is, to thy eyes, blind 
 vacancy. Those perpetual hues of spar and crystal, 
 that, couched in the vaulted roof,* rival the glorious 
 stars, are quenched, to thee, in darkness : — rest thee a 
 while; I will return." 
 
 The figure moved away ; but, ere the lapse of a mi- 
 nute, reappeared, bearing a small dark lantern, the dull 
 and feeble ray of whose light, falling in a direct stream 
 upon the wild dress and withered features of the bearer, 
 illuminated them, at the same time that comparative 
 darkness continued to brood over all, beyond the imme- 
 diate spot, in which they stood. 
 
 '* Have you, I repeat, any recollection of where, and 
 when, you encountered her, who now addresses you ?" 
 demanded the fearful shape, at the same time raising the 
 lamp to within a small distance of her face, and then 
 slowly lowering it, so as to enable Vicchy to have a per- 
 fect view of her tall, gaunt form, and shrivelled, writhen 
 features. Her lineaments were wild and haggard ; her 
 complexion, discoloured by an unnatural paleness, was 
 of the consistency of parchment ; her eyes were red, 
 and bloodshot ; her long, elfin locks, were tangled over 
 her shoulders, and their ends were tinged of a reddish 
 hue, with cna : her hands and feet were of the same

 colour.* She was wrapped in a mantle of woollen cloth, 
 which partly concealed the peculiarities of a costume, 
 which, in other respects, had something in it of an Asia- 
 tic character. In short, her whole attire and manner spoke 
 her for a Cygani. 
 
 Vicchy, at the first glance, recognised the person, 
 with whom he was now confronted, for that mysterious 
 woman, whose remembrance was accompanied by grati- 
 tude for lives rescued, and was associated, besides, with 
 the announcement of a prophecy, to which his heart still 
 clung, with fond credulity. 
 
 " The forest of Belivar,"t began Vicchy, in a low 
 voice. 
 
 ^' Enough," interposed the other, whom we may as 
 well designate, by her usual appellation of Unna; — 
 " enough, and thou rememberest, what was the lot por- 
 tioned out unto thy child?" And she proceeded to re- 
 peat, word for word, her former prediction of high estate, 
 to Veronica. " But," she added, imperiously, *' the boy, 
 Sigismund, now an inmate in the house of Count Rodna, 
 seems fated, to stand between thy issue and a crown. 
 Thou lovest thy offspring, and thou dost not want am- 
 bition. Eissenburg, if he live, I tell you, that stripling 
 will hereafter ascend a throne, in bar of the heir of Wal- 
 stein; but 'tis charactered, in the bright tracery of the 
 star; the hand of fate hath inscribed, with adamantine 
 pen, on the brass-leaved tablet of time that hath not 
 YET BEEN, that a golden glory shall circle the head of 
 Veronica, of Eissenburg. I have read it, and who shall 
 gainsay what I predestine, darkling, through the gloom 
 of the future? Only the death of Sigismund, can recon- 
 cile this contradiction. 1 have done, — thou art a father; 
 thy destiny calls aloud on thee! — thou hast a dagger!

 this way, — not a syllable, — hush!" — and Unna recon- 
 ducted him to that part of the vault, where he had first 
 entered; and then, without another word, retired from 
 his presence. She had scarcely been gone a minute, 
 ere the mouth of the excavation became again darkened, 
 and the unknown, who had accompanied Vicchy thither, 
 made his re-appearance, hauling along with him, several 
 packages, containing Hubert's property. These con- 
 sisted of various articles of clothing, which weighed all 
 the heavier, on account of certain rolls of Hungarian 
 ducats, with which they were interspersed. 
 
 " You see, I am a man of my word," said the daring- 
 bandit. Vicchy made no reply, and his companion, 
 laying his hand on sundry weighty canvass bags, pre- 
 sently resumed: — " 'Tis only this minute," he said, *' I 
 observed your specie. Do you count over the shiners, to 
 satisfy yourself, they are all right ; the beasts are com- 
 fortably lodged in a barn, not a furlong off. So now," 
 he shortly resumed, having drawn his companion near 
 the entrance; " if you will take my advice, you will 
 leave these pensas auri, and moveables where they at 
 present are, till night-time; hearken to what I shall un- 
 fold to you," — and, bending dov.n, the villain gradually 
 proceeded to open to his hearer, his horrible scheme of 
 murder. Whilst throwing open his vestment, he offered 
 the imperial proclamation, already mentioned, to the 
 notice of Vicchy, and the better to illustrate and enforce 
 his arguments, construed it aloud. He concluded, by 
 pressing the Hungarian noble, with the most plausible 
 inducements, his ingenuity suggested, to aid him in his 
 diabolical enterprise. The speciousness of the lure was 
 nicely adapted to the circumstances of tlie individual, and 
 during more than an hour's earnest discussion, one by 
 one, all the intrenchments and bastions, which Vicchy's 
 better angel had set up for his defence, were either re- 
 linquished, or broken down, by his arch assaulter, until 
 the dream of his greedy imagination became fully pos-

 We need say no more on this head. Of the subse- 
 quent vacillancy, and ultimate conduct of the Hun- 
 garian noble, the reader (if he have not skipped) is al- 
 ready informed. — q. e. d. Is our fair critic prepared 
 with another difficulty ? 
 
 The Reader. — My dear sir, I fear you are making 
 these explanations of yours, as interminable as the auto- 
 biography of Tristram Shandy, whose history, proceeded, 
 as it were, in simple arithmetical progression, whilst the 
 subject matter of his life, was accumulating in a geome- 
 trical ratio. You are in the moon ; and not having the 
 winged griffin of the Italian poet, I cannot keep up with 
 such extravaorant flio;hts. 
 
 Author. — My dear madam, let me entreat of you, 
 not to talk so figuratively. Be pleased to speak in a 
 more familiar way, and to the point. 
 
 The Reader, rousing herself from a musing posture. — 
 I see your drift, sir; you would fain, like a true crimi- 
 nal, make a kind of prolepsis of me ; but who, unless he 
 were conscious of the weakness of his incidents, would 
 attempt to anticipate the objections of his critics? 
 
 The Author. — We think it extremely unfair, your 
 taking advantage of our politeness, in having admitted you 
 behind the scenes, to insinuate such charges. We would 
 thank you to say briefly, whether there remains any par- 
 ticular, which, in your opinion, requires to be cleared 
 up ? We pause for a reply. 
 
 The Reader. — Verily, Mr. S., there is appended to 
 your last explanation, new matter, which I, in common

 As we are not at present engaged in the biography of the 
 Duke of Eissenburg, we have no desire, d force (Vennuyer^

 various incidents of his life, can only concern the reader, 
 so far as they happen to fall within the general scope of 
 our narrative, or may conduce to the interest, and un-

 St. Giles's ; yet, however, long the interval, it passes 
 over as imperceptibly, as we have observed the pages of 
 a dull novel, under the mechanical fingers of a jaded 
 reader ; or, as do the orthodox twenty minutes of the 
 
 reverend Dr. , commonly consumed, by the oblivious 
 
 churchwarden, in the world of dreams. 
 
 Vicchy had been consigned to a gloomy chamber, des- 
 tinated for the domestic prison of the chateau. The sides 
 were characteristically ornamented with heavy irons, and 
 a massive chain went entirely round the walls, M'ith the 
 exception of the interval of the door, which was fabricated 
 of iron, and lined with cloth, in order to deaden sound. 
 This singular fitting up, and appropriation of an apart- 
 ment in a private residence, significant of the disorganized 
 condition of the country, at the era of our story, is still 
 ordinary to Hungarian habitations. On the evening of the 
 second day of his incarceration, the magnat was reclining 
 on a low form, buried in anxious thought about his child's 
 fate and his own ; when, Veronica, who had liberty of 
 egress and regress, being at the time absent, the door of 
 the massive walled room, in which he was immured, was 
 heard to creak on its hinges, and the eyes of the prisoner 
 were bent upon his gaoler, who, after ushering in a tall 
 man, wrapt, from heel to helm, in a dark mantle, with- 
 drev/. 
 
 The visitor stationed himself, with his back to the 
 small window, or rather loophole, through which the 
 beams of the pale queen of night streamed into the cham- 
 ber ; and looked intently, and silently, upon the captive, 
 who had risen upon his entrance. 
 
 Hubert drew back, and gazed, in turn, on the shrouded 
 figure. " Who art thou ?" he at length demanded. 
 
 " I speak to the Duke of Eissenburg, I presume?" 
 returned the stranger, after a minute's pause. 
 
 Vicchy started with surprise, " That voice !" he ex- 
 claimed, — '^ speak, tell me, do I address myself in this last 
 extremity to "

 " Pereny/' added the other. 
 
 ** Your name, ray lord," he proceeded, " I fortunately 
 ascertained from these papers, which it seems are your 
 property," — and the speaker placed several letters and 
 memoranda, upon a deal table beside him. " I have like- 
 wise held a brief, but most interesting conversation, with 
 an eloquent little advocate of yours. One, whose word 
 can no more be doubted, than the oracles of Heaven. 
 Did I need such proof of your innocence, your child 
 would have convinced me, that you are falsely implicated 
 in this horrible affair. She has explained, by what means 
 you became companioned by that sanguinary myrmidon, 
 to whom I owe the loss of an invaluable friend. She has 
 satisfied me, that you did your utmost, the other night, 
 to raise an alarm, which only your ignorance of the topo- 
 graphy of the house, rendered abortive. But these 
 proofs, which lead me so directly to the conclusion of your 
 innocence, cannot, I fear, be forthcoming, without com- 
 promising your safety in other respects, and which should, 
 no less, be evited." 
 
 Vicchy remained for a space, with downcast eyes, 
 silent, and thoughtful. At length, he raised his head, and 
 replied, ''The graf Pereny must be well aware, that a 
 word from him would rectify the wrong, that wrested law, 
 and false witnesses have done my honour, in which case, 
 there would no longer be an objection to my acknowledg- 
 ing my rank, before any tribunal in Hungary." There 
 was a moment of musing, and painful pause. 
 
 Pereny shook his head — he appeared disconcerted, but 
 quickly rallying, " My lord," he said abruptly, " give me 
 leave to ask, have you not a brother ?" 
 
 " I have," replied Hubert, with some surprise. 
 
 " Is there not a striking likeness between you both ?" 
 again demanded the other. 
 
 " I cannot say," replied Vicchy. " In his boyhood, 
 my brother fled from home, and has never since been 
 heard of. But what may be your motive for the inquiry?"

 " It matters not," returned Pereny, — " let it suffice, I 
 am as convinced of your guiltlessness, in the matter of 
 your outlawry, as I am of your having been unjustly 
 suspected, on the present occasion, although no fewer 
 than half a dozen of my followers, have conspired to 
 swear, and perhaps believe, that you led the band, which 
 ravished from me, on my bridal day, the sister of the late 
 king." He paused, and then proceeded, in a somewhat 
 unsteady voice ; " although I may not explain how such 
 a coincidence of error hath arisen, yet, from circumstances, 
 I need not further advert to ; I know, for a moral cer- 
 tainty, that you could have had no hand whatsoever, in 
 the fatal abduction of the princess; but I, like yourself, 
 my lord, am the sport of a malignant destiny, and dare 
 not show myself in the world's eye ; my life is sought by 
 my enemies, with an inveteracy of rancour, unexampled 
 in the history of mankind. I must myself shun, by dis- 
 guise and concealment, the renewed persecution of my 
 foes. Thus circumstanced, however inclined, I have no 
 means of saving you, in the manner you point out. Our 
 longer conference would attract observation. All 1 can 
 engage for, is, to connive at your escape, which I am 
 willing to do, because your present predicament is chiefly 
 to be attributed to your having been borne along, in the 
 train of my misfortunes, and although I am not answer- 
 able for your involvement in my mysterious fate, I am no 
 less desirous, if possible, to save you harmless. It only 
 remains for me to take my leave. Good night — my lord." 
 Closing the conference, by this abrupt transition, the 
 Count Pereny suddenly retired from the apartment. 
 
 To pursue the circumstances of Vicchy's life, at this 
 period, with any minuteness, is, beside our present pur- 
 pose ; let it suffice, that, by the friendly assistance of 
 Pereny, (of whom, in the sequel, we shall, perhaps, have 
 occasion to say more,) the unhappy noble, and his 
 daughter, succeeded in effecting their escape. After 
 various chances and dangers, they, at length, arrived

 in the capital of Austria, there to await the gradual en- 
 croachments of starvation, amid the horrors, and petty 
 humiliations of that debasing want, which, perhaps, after 
 all, is the subtlest, the most fatal, and immitigable an- 
 tagonist, with which virtue has to contend, the sorest 
 trial, allotted to man, in this flinty, and cold-hearted 
 world. Indeed, if the shrinking delicacies of feminine 
 innocence, be taken into account, the miseries implied, 
 in a fall from opulence, make the saddest aspect, to our 
 thinking, in which sad humanity can be contemplated. 
 The rags, and corporeal sufferings, nay, the contumelies, 
 and base subjections, incident to extreme poverty, sink 
 to nothing, in comparison, with its revolting, and nearly 
 inevitable companionship, with ignorance and vice ; — 
 'tis the loathsome miasm, infecting the haunts of vulgar 
 depravity — the breathing in of which impure airs, con- 
 stitutes the cruel, and constant necessity of the lower 
 classes — that clothes the idea of utter indigence, in its 
 direct horrors ; 'Us what must blast the eyes to look on ; 
 'tis what harrows up the ears to listen to ; 'tis what one 
 sense or other must be condemned to writhe beneath, 
 throughout the garish day, and the sleepless night, 
 whose horrid apprehension must curdle up the inmost 
 soul of sensibility. Feeling thus, we hardly go along 
 with the first of England's living poets,* when he quits 
 his lakes, to beautify, with his refined humanities, the 
 ordinary dwelling-places of our metropolis :

 and thenceforth, " with other notes," he would sing of the 
 hazy atmosphere of London. Nor, for the same reason, 
 can we sympathize, with certain passages of an English 
 Opium Eater's interesting confessions. That the divine 
 drug, he aiFected, might add a keener relish to Grassini's 
 strains, we can understand ; that it might tend to en- 
 hance les delicatesses of Platonic love-making, we ad- 
 mit, though, according to the Encyclopsedia Britannica, 
 its virtues would seem rather calculated to heighten a 
 more substantial gratification ; but, that its influence 
 should ever drive a scholar and a gentleman " to all the 
 markets, to which the poor resort, on a Saturday night, 
 for laying out their wages,"* is, what appears to us, not 
 less antipathous to the due operation of opium, than 
 would be a dose of citric acid ; and, were it not on re- 
 cord, we should have conceived it impossible, that such 
 an eflfect could ever have sprung from such a cause. 
 
 Should the reader be sceptical, in respect to poverty's 
 involving tortures, more exquisite than '' the rack, the 
 cord, the bowl," only let him, if he dare, " expose" him- 
 self, in bare imagination, " to feel what wretches feel." 
 Let him subject his own innocent relative, whose edu- 
 cation, heretofore, may have wound refinement, even 
 to fastidiousness, and purity, the most sensitive, into her 
 fair form, to the disgusting familiarities (disgusting, how- 
 ever well meant) of coarse, and hardened natures. Let 
 him, in idea, plunge, with this sweet and shrinking plant, 
 amid the central gloom, and leprosies of London's brothel- 
 courts, and then — but we forbear. There are prospects 
 from which the mind turns away, with instinctive, and 
 invincible antipathy.

 long in arriving. Why should we insist upon the aggra- 
 vations of such a lot, and harrow up the feelings of our 
 readers, by particularizing low carking cares, distresses,

 and horrors, which have in them something prostrating 
 to our common humanity ? We would merely give the 
 reader to understand, that, for twelve months, no con- 
 temptible segment of human life, the father and child, 
 had to endure every species of destitution, implied, in that 
 significant, and dreadful phrase, abject, absolute penury. 
 One bleak, winter's night, Vicchy, without knowing 
 whither he should betake himself, sallied from his 
 wretched hovel, in a state of mind, which very despera- 
 tion rendered accessible to imaginings of unknown, and 
 direful horrors. What a thought for a parent! — the 
 young life of his beloved Veronica, was about to yield 
 its last sand, through very inanition ! Hell grew, and 
 darkened on his soul. It was midnight, and wildered 
 with bad and agonizing suggestions, the malesuada 
 fames* after sauntering from street to street, he found 
 himself at the end of the Landstracht, near one of the 
 bridges, which crossed the Vienne. Here, ensconcing 
 himself within the deep shadow, cast from a jutting wall, 
 he took his station. The spot was lone and unfrequented. 
 He had not, however, stood there above a few seconds, 
 and had began already to waver in his purpose, when his 
 ears caught the sound of trampling hoofs. He is on the 
 alert ; and, as the equestrian neared him, Vicchy sprung 
 forward. He seizes the reins, and, presenting his pistol 
 to the horseman's face, in a peremptory tone, demands 
 his money. Had the figure addressed been stone, it 
 could not have regarded this, so startling an action, with 
 greater apparent indiflPerence. Slowly the horseman 
 turned his head, and, with admirable presence of mind, 
 struck up the muzzle, with his arm, and wrenched the 
 weapon, out of the grasp of the highwayman. Then, dis- 
 mounting, he grappled with him, and pinioned him to 
 the earth. 
 
 *' Strike, if thou wilt, and welcome," said the wretched 
 
 * Malesuada. — "Who but Virgil would have hit on so felicitous an 
 epithet to Famine ?

 man"; '' but, oh ! as thou art a knight, and hope for 
 eternal salvation, save the life of a sinless child, now 
 perishing for want, in yonder city !" 
 
 "= Arise, Eissenburg !" exclaimed the other — '' I only 
 meant to show you the peril in which you stood. Ere 
 next you level that pistol, seek out your foes — lam 
 none. Here, man, is my purse," and the knight handed 
 him a leathern bag, with a weight of gold pieces in it. 
 '* There, 'tis the gift of a friend. Wilt thou meet me on 
 this spot to-morrow at early twilight ? I think 1 can 
 show you a way, by which you may have that purse re- 
 plenished, whenever it jingles less merrily. No thanks — 
 you are heartily welcome." 
 
 Vicchy gazed on the very juvenile appearance of the 
 gallant cavalier, with a mingled feeling of doubt, admi- 
 ration, and terror. By what inspiration could he have 
 learned his title? Whence arose that extraordinary 
 strength, which belied his youthful aspect? And, to 
 what Christian source, could he attribute that uncommon 
 generosity, which, not content with pardoning the man, 
 who levelled a pistol at his head, gave into the ruffian's 
 hand, a heavy purse, and hinted at a treasury, from 
 whence, when it grew lighter, he might replenish it ? 
 The voice sounded familiar to him ; — but the appearance 
 was that of a stranger. He remained in speechless asto- 
 nishment, while his liberal benefactor was caressing his 
 noble Arabian, ere he vaulted into his seat. Then he 
 beheld him, after displaying unusual grace, and dex- 
 terity of horsemanship, gallop from the spot. The next 
 minute, that bridge was, once more, as still and quiet 
 as midnight, and deep solitude, could render it. 
 
 Vicchy stood, for a moment, entranced in thought ; 
 had he been dreaming ? — or, was the being indeed an 
 angel, and, were those broad gold coins, he clanked 
 against each other, an angel's gift ? Alas, no, wretched 
 man ! Why, at that most awful, and portentous crisis, 
 did not your heart rather whisper to you, that you had

 MANUSCRIPT IX. 357 
 
 seen an apostate spirit incarnate ; and that that purse, 
 you dangled in your hand, was an earnest of an unut- 
 terable barter, about to be established, betwixt the great 
 tempter and yourself? With audible thankfulness, to 
 his sainted namesake, for having spared him the perpe- 
 tration of a fearful crime, and congratulating himself, 
 besides, on his escape out of such imminent risk, with 
 life, Vicchy retraced his steps homeward. 
 
 The mortal hours of Veronica, had been, certainly, 
 numbered, on that night, only for the relief her father 
 brought her. 
 
 On the next evening, towards dusk, the two men 
 again met, at the foot of the same bridge, when the fatal 
 compact was entered into, which set the last seal upon 
 the doom of the Duke of Eissenburg, who, from that 
 hour, became the thrall of the bandit Ragotzy. Through 
 the interest of Father Dominick, exerted at the re- 
 quest of the Cygani leader, Vicchy was appointed to 
 a command in the national troop ; although it was only a 
 short time before the opening of our story, that he came 
 to take up his abode in Hermanstadt. 
 
 From the above epoch, crime, danger, and deceit 
 hovered about the path of that fallen magnat, like flitting 
 fiends. Treacherous, as a defender of his country, he 
 sunk to compromise her interests, at the command of the 
 Cygani leader. False to the oaths, by which Ragotzy 
 believed him bound, he betrayed, for lucre, the move- 
 ments of the brigand to the Richter Iwan. Sold to all, 
 and faithful to none ; — it is enough to say, that such 
 was the character of the outlawed constable of Hungary, 
 at the period, when he joined the sentinel on the ram- 
 part, as narrated in the first manuscript of our veri- 
 table history. 
 
 
CHAPTER
 
 The object of the regent of Hungary in professing to 
 accept the crown, tendered to him by the envoy of King- 
 Ferdinand, even at the time, he meditated inflicting a 
 most signal chastisement on the imperial force, under the 
 Marquis Piadena, will be explained in the sequel. It 
 may suffice in this place to observe, that Martinuzzi was 
 not of a disposition patiently to endure dictation, because 
 the conduct prescribed, happened to concur with his own 
 views. He foresaw, clearly, that in the event of the city 
 ofColoswar falling, and Ferdinand's obtaining forcible 
 possession of the regalia, but one of two alterna- 
 tives would be left open to him. He would either bo.

 driven to accept the crown, as the fief of Austria, accord- 
 ing to the proposition of Antoine Ferraro, or he must sub- 
 mit to the sacred treasure being transmitted to Vienna, 
 as a legitimate spoil of war. To raise the siege of this 
 important fortress, therefore, and at the same time to 
 strike a blow, which should make Austria rue her insolent 
 aggression, were motives, which determined the regent to 
 take the field. 
 
 For weeks before the insidious proffer of the Austrian 
 envoy, Martinuzzi's attention had been drawn to the 
 forced marches of Castaldo, and the visit of Sultan 
 Solyman to Hermanstadt, under the pseudonyme of Abu 
 Obeida, had partly related to the same matter. Secretly, 
 Martinuzzi concentrated his forces in the vicinage of the 
 capital, and concerted his measures with the august Turk, 
 for the relief of Coloswar. It was determined, that the 
 Turkish Basha Achamates should conduct his army from 
 Belgrade, by a circuitous route towards the point of 
 attack most to be guarded against, but since the surprise 
 which was contemplated, required to be executed, not 
 only with celerity, but with secrecy and caution, it was 
 not till the eve of his own departure from Hermanstadt, 
 that Martinuzzi despatched the bloody glaive through the 
 province, to summon all, who held their possessions by 
 military tenure, to meet him, and join the standard of 
 their respective chiefs, as they marched towards Colos- 
 war.* He preferred commencing operations with a force 
 numerically inferior to what he might have collected, by 
 transmitting his sanguinary summons a few days sooner, 
 to risking the betrayal of the mine he was about to 
 spring, ere the enemy learnt its existence in the instant 
 of explosion. " Nuntiosque periculi victoria prsece- 
 deret."f Owing to this cause, many of the more de- 
 voted of the regent's partizans whose feudal estates, lay 
 remote from the scene of action, had not rendezvoused 
 near the Samos by the time, that the Hungarian army

 reached its banks. Martinuzzi had previously detached 
 ten thousand of his choicest horsemen, under command 
 of Quendi Ferens, in whose zeal and ability he confided, 
 with orders to cross some leagues below Coloswar, and 
 then, by means of a slight detour, to make a demonstra- 
 tion on the left wing of the imperial army. He expected 
 so to time his own passage, as to be in a position to 
 engage the Austrians in front, just as the hostile lines of 
 Quendi Ferens and Castaldo, came into conflict. If 
 Castaldo should be forced to retire from the field— by 
 that most dispiriting of all movements, a running fight 
 with a superior enemy, he would be precipitated upon 
 the lines of Achamates, (to whose army the inequalities 
 of the ground, and the vast tracks of forest afforded a 
 present cover,) and thus placed between three fires, his 
 utter destruction would appear to be inevitable. This 
 scheme, however felicitously conceived, was impeded in 
 the working by an accident, that it was impossible Mar- 
 tinuzzi should forecast. We allude to the sudden cold- 
 ness, which sprung up during the past night between the 
 regent and his sublime guest, consequent on the latter's 
 assassination of the Count Balassi. Though no word 
 passed on either side, pointing to that intent, Martinuzzi 
 suspected, that he would do wrong 'to rely on any co- 
 operation of the Turk, in the engagement which impended. 
 The hope and confidence, with which he had taken the 
 field, were thus to a certain degree abated; and to add 
 to his state of dubiety in respect to the issue, his principal 
 officers had discovered a much greater lukewarmness, 
 and disinclination to his cause, than he could have appre- 
 hended, though he still had reason to fear, he was not cog- 
 nizant of the disaffection to its whole extent. Now, 
 however, such considerations presented themselves too 
 late. A portion of his best troops had already pushed 
 forward beyond recall, and, if he would not leave his finest 
 corps d'armee to be cut off by the army of Castaldo, it 
 became unavoidable to make the passage he originally

 proposed, and, at all hazards, to operate a diversion in 
 Quendi Ferens' favour. 
 
 Long before the grey light of the earliest dawn was 
 mellowed by the sun's rays, the Hungarians were gra- 
 dually formed in array of battle. As fast, as each feudal 
 captain successively gained the opposite banks of the 
 river, he marshalled his respective followers. They got 
 into position on an irregular chain of hillocks, which 
 extended from within a quarter of a mile of the Abbey of 
 Coloswar, — where their right wing rested part against 
 the river, part in air, — to a deep wood, which protected 
 the extremity of their left flank. In front, the ground 
 fell away rather precipitately, and at their rear flowed 
 the river Samos, which also formed an angle with their 
 extreme right. The abbey, peninsula'd, and connected 
 by an isthmus of eminences with the imperial position, 
 was distant about half a mile from Coloswar ; and held 
 as an advanced post of the beleaguering force. The space 
 betwixt the city walls and the sacred edifice was of a 
 broken, marshy, and impracticable character, traversed 
 in those days by a narrow branch of the Samos, that oc- 
 cupying in its course a deep ravine, was still left feathered 
 by a few larch and other pine trees. This brook covered 
 the advanced lines of the Austrians, and extended by a 
 semi-circular sweep, as far as the extremity of their left 
 wing, — its two wooden bridges had been broken down, 
 at the commencement of the siege, by order of Count 
 Raoul, one of the Castellans of the fortress. On an op- 
 posite chain of heights, running off in an oblique direc- 
 tion from the Abbey of Coloswar, was posted the greattr 
 half of the imperial army, which presented the appear- 
 ance of several detached segments of a convex circle. 
 The easy slopes declining into the vale, that winded 
 between the opposing armies, rapidly diverged from 
 their nearest proximity, not far from the abbey, till at, 
 what may be called their base, namely, the distance 
 between the extreme right of Castaldo, and the extreme

 left of the Hungarian army ; the marshy level intervened 
 for an interval of more than three miles. So that this 
 almost continuous sweep of men-at-arms, suggested 
 rather the idea of the battle array of a single army, than of 
 its being the hostile order of two distinct and adverse 
 forces. In the rear of the imperialists extended a slight 
 range of undulating ground, richly, though irregularly 
 wooded. Their advanced position, as we have said, 
 curved forward, so far as the venerable abbey, which 
 it occupied. Their one flank inclined towards the 
 rising wood; their left had been thrown to some distance 
 from their centre, and was in a great measure hidden 
 from the view of the Hungarians, by the interposing 
 buttresses of Coloswar. It was at this point, that Quendi 
 Ferens first came in contact with the enemy. There was 
 little disparity, in respect to numerical force between the 
 two armies. Each might consist of about fifty thousand 
 men, — in addition to which, Martinuzzi reckoned on the 
 diversion of some five thousand troops engarrisoned in 
 Coloswar; and on such co-operation, as might be ex- 
 pected from the fierce and undisciplined bands of pea- 
 santry, which in great numbers had flocked to his as- 
 sistance, from all parts of the country. He, moreover, had 
 originally relied, in case of need, on being supported by 
 the army of Massanates, which, to the amount of near a 
 hundred thousand men, lay encamped at about five or 
 six leagues distance, on the actual base of the beleaguering 
 force. The clock of the abbey knelled three hours after 
 midnight, as the regent touched land. He instantly 
 mounted on his Anatolian charger, and rode to a gentle 
 eminence, which commanded a view of the battle field, 
 now veiled in the dim indistinct twilight of the waning 
 stars. He had no difficulty, however, in tracing the 
 enemy's position on the opposite bank, by the pale 
 glimmer of their watch light. 
 
 " My lords and copatriots," said the regent, ad- 
 dressing himself to his chiefs and principal officers, who

 now congregated round him, to learn the order of battle, 
 and receive his last commands ; " this day the insulting 
 spoiler must either bite the dust, or Hungary bid adieu 
 henceforth for ever to that independence of a foreign 
 yoke, which, for centuries, it has been the glory of her 
 sons to preserve inviolate. For such as outlive this day, 
 there is no middle condition between slavery and triumph. 
 Is there a man of ye, but who would call upon his native 
 soil to cover him, rather than be daily and hourly held 
 in subjection, by German laws and German lawgivers ? 
 Is there one who would not prefer, that the source of life 
 failed, as beseems a hero and a patriot, in the field of 
 carnage, than, for the sake of a wretched remnant of ex- 
 istence, to have the tide at one eternal ebb, indignant at 
 the heart, and feel, ay, witheringly feel, the honest crim- 
 son mantling his manly brow in humble shame, before 
 whom ? — his God ? — no, his fellow creature ! but not 
 his fellow countryman ; before the Nemet* viceroy and 
 the Nemet waivode, to know, like the despoiled and en- 
 slaved Bohemian, that his country's vars and cities have 
 Austrian governors; to see his own allodial estates, the 
 castles and manors of his fathers, possessed by Austrians 
 of the meanest birth, and lowest station, and to be 
 loaded, like the citizens of Prague, so late his fellow- 
 subjects, with new and exorbitant imposts, to defray the 
 expense of his coercion. To know, — ay, mark this, my 
 friends ! and let it nerve your arms, and make steady 
 your hearts, in the hour of battle, — to know, I say, that 
 that crown, which he, who annexed Erdely to the terri- 
 tory of the Magyars, and who now, a blessed saint in 
 heaven, looks down on this day's great question, re- 
 ceived, as a symbol at once, and an evidence of Hun- 
 garia's sovereignty, — that this crown, fabricated by 
 angels, that erst circled the head of Constantine himself, 
 — this crown, the gift of Rome, is worn by a petty prince

 our beautiful tongue is a dead letter, and the classic lan- 
 guage of our constitution, that which Cicero spake, and 
 which hath clothed our coronation oath, with I know 
 not what of sanctity, for many a century of freedom, — 
 that language, ay, by Heavens ! the very words, by virtue 
 of which Ferdinand will wear your crown, are a blank to

 indeed, you need not hope for such an honour; no, by 
 one act, your conqueror means to deprive you of the 
 favour of Heaven, which the possession of St. Stephen's 
 diadem typifies, and assures to Transylvania, and to despoil 
 you of all honour among the nations, by bearing away 
 the ornament of your kings, — ivhither? — to Vienna. 
 Infamous plunder ! eternal ignominy ! Shall we suffer

 unfurl, be not destined to wave over us, in triumph, it 
 must be wrenched from your regent's gripe in death. 
 The means of retreat," he added (unbuckling his golden 
 spurs, and throwing them aside), " not less in obedience 
 to the laws, than in accordance with my stern resolve, I 
 thus, in the sight of all, cast from me. Hungarians ! 
 your standard-bearer only quits the field as a corpse, or 
 as a conqueror !"* 
 
 The loudest acclamations followed this harangue, min- 
 gled with the clangour of bucklers and the clashing of 
 swords on " sounding shields," while ten thousand lances 
 were flourished in the air. At a little space apart, some 
 dozen chiefs and magnats might be observed, consulting 
 together with impassioned gestures, but in under tones, 
 while a greater number thronged round the regent, with 
 expressions, indicative of their determination to conquer 
 or die. 
 
 " A word respecting the order of battle," resumed Mar- 
 tinuzzi, after a minute's pause. "My Lord Zrinii, here 
 are your orders : you will find I commit the left wing to 
 your command. Your gallant son Balthazar, I shall 
 retain, by your leave, along with my nephew Pereny, 
 near my person. Your post, noble Horwith, is to head 
 the right wing ; George, Count Tury, and Stephanus, 
 Count Dobus, are appointed to the reserve. And for the 
 vanguard, my lords — " 
 
 " Ay, the vanguard !" interpealed several voices, " who 
 leads the vanguard ?" 
 
 " Think not," cried Count Nadastis, in an insolent 
 tone, " that warriors like us, some with blood-royal in 
 their veins, and many of whom can trace their descent, 
 beyond that epoch, you just reminded us of, will submit 
 to be led by a gownsman ! Nobles are in the field, whose

 line of ancestry enrols a hundred sires, — let one of such 
 be appointed to the vanguard." 
 
 He stopped, and another voice broke in : — " The crown 
 of St. Stephen, if not on Ferdinand's, on whose brow do 
 you mean it to descend ? Peers of Hungary, we have a 
 greater enemy to bustle with than Ferdinand, if we durst 
 but front him. — Speak out, lord cardinal, and tell us for 
 whom we are to spill our blood, or we stir not from this 
 spot." 
 
 " He intends to make himself king, and we are to pe- 
 rish, to pave the way for his ambitious projects," cried 
 another. 
 
 " He conspires to dethrone the Lady Czerina," ex- 
 claimed a former voice. 
 
 "To dethrone her," repeated Count Nadastis ; " say, 
 to murder her ! Soldiers ! the life of your sovereign is 
 not safe. All join to rescue the Lady Czerina — the Rex 
 Hungarise*, — and let this ambitious churchman learn to 
 tremble at our union." 
 
 Immediately, aery of " Czerina !" was raised by some 
 score of voices. The insurgent chiefs who were near, 
 took up the word ; it was caught by those further re- 
 moved, and then reverberated along the ranks. The 
 origin of the interpellation not being understood some 
 paces off, many probably supposed, it had been given 
 forth by the commander, for a war-cry. Like a feu-de- 
 joie, from voice to voice, the name of Czerina was wafted 
 up to the heavens, in one long peal, by the whole army. 
 
 Some very painful thoughts, mingled, not unlikely, 
 with feelings not altogether so, struggled in the breast of 
 the cardinal ; he averted his head, as if desirous of hid- 
 ing his emotion, and for a minute there was silence upon 
 the ground — deep, and difficult — the silence of sus- 
 pense. It was broken by Martinuzzi.

 " Is this just? Is this honourable ? Is this your patri- 
 otism, valiant capitanies V he demanded, in a voice, that 
 rang from the embattled plain up to the clear and placid 
 sky. " I show you," he proceeded, pointing at the same 
 time with his hand, in the direction of the adverse arma- 
 ment — "I show you the road to renown, or, I should say, 
 the only road to safety, and you turn on your deliverer — 
 on the very man, who (pardon me, Heaven ! the boast 
 wrung from me by ingratitude,) who, again and again, in 
 the field, and at the council-board, has proved your sal- 
 vation. I bring you in front of the invader, and at the 
 point of battle, ay, at that very time, when I am about 
 to cast my life in a common stake with your own, you 
 take the advantage of my defencelessness, to put this 
 outrage on me — me ! to whom one and all owe their 
 properties, their lives, their liberties, and their having a 
 country to fight for. For shame, lords ! no more of this ! 
 rather let our deeds, on this day, evince who best loves 
 Hungaria. You, my brave capitanies, who purpose to 
 adhere to her cause, put yourselves at the head of your 
 several commands ; let all others withdraw from the field. 
 My part, gentlemen, is taken ; stand by me who list. 
 Here am I rooted, and not the assault of yon host, nor 
 the unjust clamour of men, false to themselves and duty, 
 shall shake me; if I am forced, single and unaided, to 
 do battle, so be it. Let Castaldo, with Tarquin strides, 
 come on, and conspiracy do its worst, by this ensign, the 
 regent of Hungary is pledged to stand or fall." 
 
 This brief address, which probably owed, at least as 
 much to the earnestness of the regent's manner, and the 
 warm tone, in which it was delivered, as to the words 
 themselves, imparted to most of the hearers a portion of 
 the fire, which glowed in the bosom of the speaker. The 
 majority of those present, hasted at once to their allotted 
 posts, and even such magnats as were most disinclined to 
 the regent's government, were impressed by the honest

 MANUSCRIPT XXV. 11 
 
 fervor of his speech. They came to reflect, that the 
 present was not the hour or the arena for settling their 
 differences. However, some few loitered, " frustrate of 
 their will," and still seeking a cause of quarrel. 
 
 " You have not yet told us, who is to lead the van- 
 guard," cried Count Nadastis. " If we must have a 
 gownsman for our king, we at least need not submit to 
 his rule in battle." 
 
 " Ay, surely 'tis contrary to law," exclaimed another. 
 
 In the midst of these treasonable cries, repeated from 
 mouth to mouth, another chieftain, with flushed cheek 
 and impassioned gesture, appeared on the scene ; he was 
 on foot, and walked up to the regent: it was Count 
 Maylat. — " I demand to know," he said, " who leads 
 the vanguard ?" 
 
 Martinuzzi looked at him, sternly, and was about to 
 reply, when a firing beyond the city walls, passed off in 
 thundering echoes along the distant woods. Loud shouts, 
 the din of drums, and the reports of arquebuses, gave 
 note that the battle had begun. Then it was known that 
 Quendi Ferens, in spite of the state of the roads, and 
 other impediments, had, at length, moved round, and 
 commenced the work of destruction. 
 
 " Balthazar," said the regent, " speed to your father, 
 and bid him push forward with all his force. — Where," 
 he murmured to himself, " where, in the name of God ! 
 loiters Turascus ? Trumpeter, sound a charge ! — to 
 arms ! to arms !" rang along the lines, like the shrill 
 summons of fate, and the long roll of the drums, and the 
 flourishing accompaniment of the trumpets, shook the air 
 with their martial music. 
 
 As that wild point of war sunk upon the wind, May- 
 lat broke in upon the pause, — " Who leads the van- 
 guard ?" he persisted, keeping close beside the regent. 
 
 The charger of Martinuzzi reared and plunged vio- 
 lently ; but the attention of the horseman was appa-

 rently directed to the city walls. Presently, the gates 
 were thrown open, and line after line of men-at-arms 
 began to deploy through the portcullis. 
 
 "Lord cardinal, who leads the vanguard, I again de- 
 mand of you ?" cried Maylat, in a menacing voice, 
 rashly impaling the ensign's staff, in his eagerness to en- 
 force the prelate's attention. 
 
 Martinuzzi turned on his saddle, and, like lightning 
 was the glance, he shot down upon the daring magnat. 
 "Treason!" he shouted forth, in a voice, that sounded 
 through the host, like a war-trumpet, and at the word, 
 his falchion claved the air, and instantaneously the graf 
 released his hold, as the severed tendons of his wrist reeked 
 round with blood. "Lord Maylat, I lay you under 
 arrest. Nephew! look to it;" and, almost immedi- 
 ately, the maimed and bleeding graf was borne away, by 
 a few men-at-arms, commanded by Maximilian Pereny. 
 
 The decision of the regent was productive of present 
 good, though it proved only to be temporary. The in- 
 cendiary nobles drew back, almost to a man. It was at 
 this moment, that Count Turascus arrived upon the field. 
 
 " My lord," said Martinuzzi, " we have waited for 
 you, — your tardiness hath caused some hot question 
 here, ill-timed, to say the least of it : you are aware, 
 that by customary right, the distinction of generalissimo 
 belongs to the "palatine, and, since you, my dear lord, 
 at present perform the duties of that office, I herewith 
 deliver you your truncheon. Gentlemen, noble knights, 
 chieftains, of Hungary ! Valentinian Count Turascus, 
 the son of a line of a hundred sires, leads the vanguard 
 in this day's battle." 
 
 Turascus bowed, and then, in an under tone, ad- 
 dressed a few words to the regent. 
 
 A shade of something like anxiety passed across the 
 countenance of Martinuzzi, like a darkening cloud, — 
 " I trust the day will not go so hard with us," he said ; 
 " but now to the van ! — and, perhaps, it were better you

 detached some of yon mal-contents with their clans, to 
 reconnoiter. We must avoid, if possible, their being left 
 unemployed, — 'inaction, at such a time, were the father 
 of conspiracy. See, if Count Zrinii have not half-tra- 
 versed the morass, and already threatens the right flank 
 of the enemy ! Go, and prepare to support him, — nay, 
 courage, Turascus, we must conquer or perish /" 
 
 The discharge of musketry from the opposite heights 
 bore a tremendous burthen to his words, and, in truth, 
 the position of both armies, at that moment, was not a 
 little critical. It seemed impossible, but that defeat must 
 prove destruction to the party, which should sustain it. 
 Martinuzzi, if routed, was precluded, by the river in his 
 rear, from accomplishing his retreat ; besides that, in a 
 moral and political point of view, the consequences of his 
 failure, in this bold enterprise, were incalculable. Thus 
 much seemed certain, the independent existence of 
 Transylvania, and all chance of the resuscitation of Hun- 
 gary were alike at stake. On the other hand, if Castaldo 
 were worsted, he would have to encounter the army of 
 Massanates in his line of retreat. 
 
 Meantime, the garrison of Coloswar, commanded by 
 Raoul, had sallied from the fortress in strength, and pro- 
 ceeding across the impracticable ground and morass be- 
 fore-mentioned, commenced a series of attacks, on the 
 advanced post of the abbey. The assailants were re- 
 ceived with " the iron sleet of arrowy shower," mingled 
 with musketry. Three times did Raoul advance to dis- 
 lodge the enemy from this formidable position, and, as 
 often was his sortie unsuccessful, and he driven back 
 across the swamp, under cover of the city defences. 
 
 Martinuzzi saw, that the gaining this point would be 
 attended with considerable results, since, from its being 
 on a level with the table-land of the Austrian lines, he 
 could make it the basis of his operations, instead of 
 having to ascend to the range of acclivity, along which 
 they were drawn up. Therefore, seizing the occasion of

 the Austrian officer having too incautiously followed up 
 his success, Martinuzzi detached two thousand of his 
 guard to carry the abbey. The diminished garrison left 
 to defend that post of vantage, was wholly inadequate to 
 withstand this fresh attack, — the place was forced, and 
 occupied, while the victorious detachment pushed on to 
 the attack of the imperialists, now in the act of refording 
 the intersecting morass. Thus, taken in front and in 
 the rear, the Austrians were broken with great slaughter; 
 the divided Samos ran red with blood, and was encum- 
 bered with dead bodies. An ensign, and more than five 
 hundred men, were made prisoners, and instantly sent off 
 to Coloswar. But now the regent began to be anxious, 
 respecting his communication with Quendi Ferens, which, 
 as matters stood, w r as effectually cut off. He feared, 
 lest Castaldo might overpower his Lieutenant-General, 
 before he were able to form a junction with him. Raoul, 
 therefore, received orders to push forwards, at the head of 
 ten thousand men, to make a grand attack on the left of 
 the Austrian centre. The troops defiled, under the eye 
 of Martinuzzi, along the ridge of the embankment or 
 causeway, commanded by the abbey. The foremost 
 ranks, amounting to one-fourth, consisted chiefly of 
 archers and slingers; behind these was a large mass of 
 cavalry, partly to protect either flank, and partly witli 
 the object of debouching through the intervals, and 
 harassing the enemy. At this moment, the sun burst 
 through his dense pavilion with extreme brilliancy. The 
 mists drew aside like a curtain, and discovered this glit- 
 tering cloud of gallant soldiers, with floating plumes 
 and pennons, sweeping forwards in compact order to the. 
 onset, — their glancing casques, and twinkling spears, 
 flashing forth like vivid lightning from its deep bosom, — 
 
 " Their gilt coats showed like dragon's scales, 
 Their march like a rough tumbling storm." 
 
 " Your eminence," said Pereny, riding up to his

 uncle; " will not refuse my accompanying Lord Raoul 
 on the charge." 
 
 "Be advised, Maximilian," said Martinuzzi; "and 
 remain by my side." 
 
 "Nay," replied Maximilian; "my hereditary claims 
 are, to say the least, as weighty as those of Turascus. 
 I looked for the vanguard, — however, if I may not bear 
 a command in this battle, the flag of Pereny waves not 
 in the wind. I shall withdraw with my handful of ca- 
 valry, into Coloswar." 
 
 " Well, have thy will, my son; and pray Heaven, 
 my forebodings prove ill-founded," said Martinuzzi. 
 
 Maximilian, with an affected smile, and an internal 
 contempt for the regent's admonitory expression of 
 countenance, dashed his steed after the column of Count 
 Raoul, and thus parted the uncle and nephew, never to 
 meet again in this world. The Marquis of Piadena's 
 disposition on that memorable day was as follows : — 
 
 His army, like that of Hungary, was divided into 
 three bodies. The centre was commanded by himself, in 
 person. The right column was entrusted to Baron Roe- 
 can, and the left, which had been so inauspiciously 
 elongated from the main body, and which was the first 
 division, opposed to the assault of Quendi Ferens, had 
 been placed under the valiant leading of Count Salm. 
 In a great measure taken by surprise, the Austrian 
 general, after three hours hard fighting, gave way to the 
 repeated onsets of Hungarian cavalry. By the rout 
 of the left wing, the centre was left uncovered; and just 
 as the Counts Raoul and Pereny, poured down in front, 
 with the whole momentum of their powerful detachment, 
 the squadrons of Quendi Ferens rolled on, like the ocean 
 at full flood, upon the flank. But the pupil of Pescara 
 proved himself, on this occasion, as well as on many 
 others, profoundly skilled in the tactics of his school. 
 Placing his men in more compact order, he caused a 
 heavy body of horse to wheel round, and outflank the

 16 MANUSCRIPTS OF ERDELY. 
 
 cavalry of Quendi Ferens, in their turn. The manoeuvre, 
 by compelling the Hungarian general to face about, 
 enabled Castaldo to anticipate the impetuous assault of 
 Raoul. Trampling down, or disregarding the feeble 
 resistance of the slingers and archers, in advance, the 
 Austrian invincibles did not wait to have their battle 
 broken, by the furious onset of the advancing enemy. 
 Castaldo pushed forward a body of horse, which darting- 
 through the intervals of the ranks, showed like the erup- 
 tion of a flash of lightning, from an overcharged cloud, — 
 and now the battle joined on all sides. Lance involved 
 with lance, — spear clashed against spear, — sword and 
 mace on helm and buckler rang, — shields locked in close 
 and mortal grapple, — fire-arms flashed, — arrows hissed, 
 and javelins hurtled by. St. Stephen for Hungary ! 
 shouted forth Count Raoul, flourishing his sword aloft ; 
 but as the sound rang on his lip, a quarrel from a cross- 
 bow, aimed from behind, struck and unhorsed him; the 
 dying general lay stretched on the earth, whilst the 
 bodies of trampling steeds instantly closed over him, like 
 the tempestuous billows above the drowning mariner. 
 
 "You have hit the mark by G — d!" observed Count 
 Nadastis, in a subdued but exulting tone, to a man habited 
 as an archer, who stood near him. The two were half 
 hidden by the broken ground, a short space apart from 
 the fray. " Her highness will thank you for this, — you 
 could hardly have bettered your aim, unless, indeed, you 
 had struck him." 
 
 " Raoul fallen!" cried the other; " and I for a time, 
 am the first man in Coloswar. Hurrah ! hurrah ! — " 
 
 " True Mirce; but restrain your exultation, and speed 
 to the city, to report the death of Raoul. Give out that 
 he fell by no foreign hand, but was falsely done to death; 
 of course the kiral. The kiral, you understand, caused 
 the assassination." 
 
 " But Nadastis," objected Mirce ; " Alaric Polgar,

 MANUSCRIPT XXV. 17 
 
 and his band, are not in the field. What can that 
 mean ?" 
 
 " They will make their presence manifest shortly, I 
 make no doubt," replied Nadastis. " Remember, how- 
 ever, in any event, whether he thunder at your gates in 
 triumph, or fly to them for refuge. Coloswar must be 
 closed to Martinuzzi." 
 
 " I have Queen Isabella's instructions for that," replied 
 Mirce, as he turned away; " trust me, T know my cue." 
 
 The tide of battle was, by this time, on the turn. Cas- 
 taldo's design, of driving back his assailants, had failed, 
 and, like a spent wave, the baffled imperialists recoiled 
 upon the surging armament, whence they issued. 
 
 Meanwhile, Maximilian Pereny, having taken the 
 command, led forward his troops, against the serried 
 lines of the enemy, with irresistible effect ; and the vio- 
 lence of the shock, might be compared to the irruption 
 of some rapid and swollen stream, that, suddenly finding 
 a vent, carries away, in its rushing course, the very 
 mounds, and sluices, that were intended to contain and 
 imprison its volume. Castaldo, despite his utmost ef- 
 forts, saw himself obliged to give ground, and, before 
 Count Nadastis, who, early in the action, had had 
 his horse shot under him, could be remounted, and 
 come up to remorate the progress of Pereny, the impe- 
 tuosity of the Hungarian charge, had fairly broken 
 through the imperial files. It was at this juncture, that 
 Quendi Ferens bore down the Spanish horse, which had 
 been opposed to him, and thundering forward, effected 
 a union with the main body. Castaldo sent orders to 
 Count Salm, to bring up his remaining force ; while he, 
 by a gradual change of position, difficult to accomplish 
 in the heat of a conflict, that every moment told more 
 and more against him, did his utmost, to insure this last 
 reserve coming into the battle, with due effect. 
 
 It was at this interesting crisis, just as the imperial

 corps-de-reserve had arrived on the scene of action, that 
 a Transylvanian warrior, having forced his horse within 
 lance's length, of the object of his animosity, confronted 
 the elated Pereny. This was Count Naclastis, who, dark 
 and terrible in aspect, and followed by a band of his re- 
 tainers, rushed forward to take the lead. 
 
 " One effort more, soldiers ! and the victory is 
 achieved !" cried Maximilian. 
 
 " Assassin of Count Raoul ! yield the command to 
 your senior, and superior in the art of war," broke in 
 Nadastis, in a loud voice. 
 
 Even amid the din of that bloody strife, many a startled 
 ear caught the sense of those fatal words, and many an 
 eye was directed to the speaker. Maximilian surveyed 
 the graf, in haughty and indignant surprise. Taken at 
 unawares, his very astonishment, for a moment, struck 
 dumb his powers of speech ; and Nadastis seized the op- 
 portunity of his silence, to follow up his fatal accusation, 
 by urging upon the victorious Hungarians, the necessity 
 of their instantly substituting him (Nadastis) to the com- 
 mand. 
 
 "Liar and traitor!" exclaimed Maximilian, when, at 
 length, his voice served him; "depart, ere I hurl thee 
 headlong to the earth." 
 
 " And add another slaughter, to that of the good cas- 
 tellan," retorted Nadastis. " Soldiers, clansmen, and 
 lovers of Count Raoul ! will you follow a man, whose 
 soul is embrued in the blood of our lord and leader ? 
 Not by an open enemy, not by an Austrian hand, was 
 he done to death ; but by the stroke of the hired assas- 
 sin of this Pereny, and his uncle." 
 
 " Lord Nadastis speaks truth," joined in a man-at- 
 arms. " I saw where the castellan fell, and noted that 
 the square-headed instrument of his death, came from 
 behind. Comrades, he has been foully murdered !" 
 
 It unfortunately happened, that at this imminent mo- 
 ment of peril, Quendi Ferens was far away, following

 MANUSCRIPT XXV. 19 
 
 up his pursuit of the imperialists. Castaldo, who occu • 
 pied the superior ground, marked the sudden halt and 
 disarray, of the Hungarians, at the moment that victory 
 so unequivocally inclined to their standard, but could 
 not divine the cause. At this crisis, Count Salm chanced 
 to be near his commander. 
 
 " One desperate experiment, my gallant friend," said 
 the latter; "and yet the day may be retrieved: ride 
 down, like a storm, upon yon staggering mass, who seem 
 disordered by their very success, and sweep them before 
 you into the valley." 
 
 In obedience to this order, Count Salm, rallying the 
 light cavalry, and Spanish auxiliaries, whom Quendi 
 Ferens had put to flight, rushed forward, and charged 
 the Hungarians, with the violence, at once, and the cele- 
 rity, of a whirlwind. The moment, in which he timed 
 his assault, was so critically favourable, that ere he 
 came within lance's length of the enemy's line of battle, 
 it presented one inextricable scene of terror and con- 
 fusion. 
 
 To explain this state of things, we should premise, 
 that from the circumstance of the men-at-arms, who had 
 sallied from Colosvvar, having been either Count Raoul's 
 own immediate serf-men, or having long served under 
 him, they experienced in his favour, that personal attach- 
 ment, incident to the feudal relation of lords and clans- 
 men. Never pausing to consider the improbability of 
 Count Nadastis' imputation, with electric facility, as is the 
 use of persons in that class of life, more especially when 
 influenced by that strong corporate spirit, which is com- 
 monly so adverse to truth and justice, they credited the

 so shallow, but infernal a figment, may be much better 
 imagined, than described, turning to his troop, conjured 
 and obtested them, not to desert him, their general, in 
 the moment of victory. His expostulations and com- 
 mands, were urged in vain. 
 
 " Murderer !" or " assassin !" was the only replication 
 he could elicit, accented by many thousand voices ; and 
 what was more exasperating, the word was taken up, 
 with insulting triumph, by the hostile ranks, and pro- 
 longed in a shout, that widely rung through the welkin. 
 
 It was then, that, excited nearly to madness, and fa- 
 tally oblivious of consequences, he unslung his carabine, 
 and, with shaking hand, presented it at the head of 
 Nadastis. 
 
 " False rebel!" cried Maximilian, " I warn you, un- 
 less you recant your base calumny, your slanderous 
 tongue shall this day feed the ravens !" 
 
 " And what art thou, that darest threaten me ?" re- 
 torted Nadastis, " whose uncle is an usurper, whose 
 father was a triple-dyed deserter of his country, — what 
 art thou thyself, but " 
 
 Here Maximilian drew the trigger of his piece, but 
 every limb trembled so violently, in his irritation, that 
 the ball whizzed past Nadastis' ear, innocuous. 
 ' " What art thou ?" repeated that chieftain, in the same 
 contemptuous tone as before, " but a vain, yet scarcely 
 stingless, excrement of earth, whom I therefore, although 
 it irks my manhood, will now put out of its pain." 
 
 With these words, Nadastis spurred his steed, and, 
 with his sword drawn, was about to make a thrust at 
 Maximilian, when he found the weapon struck upward, 
 and sent whirling fifty feet in the air. 
 
 " Leave mc to deal with him," exclaimed a deep voice, 
 that, like that of the last trumpet, abruptly bore down 
 the din of arms and argument ; and a strange gigantic 
 form, sprung through the warrior throng, like a panther 
 towards its prey.

 Every eye turned to this new ostent, and every eye 
 recoiled. The apparition was, indeed, one, which might, 
 for a moment, well appal the stoutest heart. What 
 seemed its shape, presented the grim and loathly likeness 
 of the king of terrors. The armed image looked less 
 like a living warrior, than some sculptured type or per- 
 sonification of battle. His panoply, from helm to heel, 
 had been wrought to represent the osseous characteris- 
 tics, and the gaping interstices of the gaunt skeleton : 
 three sable ostrich plumes hung over from the glittering 
 casque, like funeral pennons. 
 
 " Leave me to deal with him," thundered the dreadful 
 voice of the intruder, as he sprang beside the fiery barb 
 of Maximilan. Seizing, with a giant's grasp, the bridle- 
 rein, and raising his iron hand aloft, he reared and backed 
 the snorting animal. Startled by the abrupt and spectral 
 appearance, dismayed, probably, by its violent gesture and 
 the threatening intonation of its voice, and thrown back on 
 his haunches, by an arm of resistless power, the mettled 
 steed plunged desperately, while his rider, taken by sur- 
 prise, lost his usual arrogant self-possession, as an un- 
 wonted tremor made itself felt, through every nerve and 
 fibre, and obtained the mastery over his spirit. Be the 
 cause what it may, fear, rage, amazement, or the mingled 
 influence of all, Maximilian, in his nervous helplessness, 
 let slip the moment of safety, and was violently precipi- 
 tated upon the plain. 
 
 "To thy dunghill earth, whelp of a wolf-dog !" cried 
 the invincible destroyer. 
 
 A shout of acclamation, that rent the vault of Heaven, 
 resounded from the ranks, while thrice over the prostrate 
 body the trampling hoofs were made to pass, with mur- 
 derous aim and effect. 
 
 " Holy Mary !" gasped forth the expiring graf. " In 
 these discomplexioned garments, disfigured too with wide 
 unfashionable slashes, — with this gory aspect, and no lit- 
 tle curious device to propitiate thine eyes, no choice

 touch of fancy to allure thee to forgiveness ; what wilt 
 thou think of me ? Oh, for one drop of that waste rose- 
 
 ?whl* which I -Rascals ! slaves ! only wash away 
 
 these ugly stains from my cheek, for the love of our 
 Lady and the credit of chivalry. Oh, Mary ! thou art 
 gentle to solicit — pah ! what filthy ground for a prince 
 to die on — thou canst make allowances, — and, — " he 
 appeared to struggle for further utterance ; but, in his 
 effort to say more, the spirit of the erring Maximilian 
 went on its trackless pilgrimage. Meantime, the gigan- 
 tic knight had vaulted into the empty seat, and brandish- 
 ing his battle-axe aloft, harangued the disordered host. 
 Insisting mainly upon the manner of the death of Count 
 Raoul, he called on all who loved their lord, to turn 
 about, and avenge his murder. 
 
 While thousands were expressing their readiness to 
 follow him, in acclamations, that outrang the clashing 
 of their lances against their shields, — the Hungarian lines 
 were driven in, and Count Salm, charging at the head 
 of the cavalry of reserve, with shouts of assured victory, 
 swept every thing before him, in the general rout. The 
 Hungarian horse, who had so nearly carried the day, 
 were in turn borne back ; the field was strewed with the 
 wounded and the dead, and the remnants of the lately 
 victorious array were seen flying, in every direction. 
 
 At this crisis, Count Nadastis drew off from the com- 
 bat, and some thousands of the Hungarians followed so 
 fatal an example. With their swords sheathed, flags of 
 truce displayed, and loud cries of" Hungary and Austria 
 forever!" these deluded men threw themselves, en masse, 
 into the enemy's ranks. 
 
 The Austrian general inwardly exulted, as he saw them 
 approaching from some distance. " So," he thought, 
 " Polgar is in the field, but without his band ; this is no 
 time to question him, or, , would that he had en-

 countered the father instead of the son ; but Peter Pe- 
 reny's honors are dated." Nadastis rode up to Castaldo, 
 at a gallop, " My lord," he said, with a smile, " thus do 
 Ave, the confederated barons, keep our promise — the Lady 
 Czerina " 
 
 " I am now too busy, sir, to hear what you would say," 
 broke in Castaldo, haughtily, and turning away, to order 
 the prisoners to the rear of his position. " Does the dolt 
 think," he muttered to himself, as he rode forward, to 
 rid himself of the presence of the horrified Hungarian, 
 " that Austria has nothing else to do, than to conquer 
 kingdoms, for the sake of giving them back again?" 
 
 It was now, that Quendi Ferens re-entered on the 
 scene of action. He saw, at a glance, that the waves of 
 victory were spent, and, like some powerful spring-tide, 
 were receding from the side of Hungary. The troops of 
 the murdered Raoul were dispersed, governed by various 
 fortunes, all equally ruinous. A part were defiling into 
 the valley, under the auspices of the spectral cavalier ; 
 the remainder were either being cut to pieces, or hurried 
 away prisoners, by Count Salm's division. Still the 
 Hungarian general hesitated not an instant, in ordering 
 a charge — but the spirit of desertion was electric — the 
 greater number stood undecided, and such as obeyed, 
 wavered, before they advanced a hundred yards. Count 
 Salm, having wheeled about and attacked them in flank, 
 this gallant body of horse were broken with great 
 slaughter. It was in vain that Quendi Ferens called 
 upon them to stand to the combat, he had the inexpres- 
 sible grief of beholding his victorious cavalry sink under 
 the shock, as if touched by a spell. 
 
 Meantime, the battle was fiercely contested, on Cas- 
 taldo's right. Baron Roccan found the utmost difficulty 
 in keeping his ground, since, besides having to hold 
 Count Zrinii's force at bay, his flank was exposed to the 
 hostile operations of some thousands of the peasantry, 
 who, armed with clubs, hatchets, scythes, and other rus-

 tic implements, were, ever and anon, debouching through 
 the broken glades of woodland. The post, occupied by 
 these undisciplined forces, enabled them to maintain and 
 renew their efforts at pleasure, and, on each repulse, 
 they would escape within the wooded recesses, where the 
 Austrian horse could not act against them, to reform 
 for a fresh sally. 
 
 At length, Count Turascus, who commanded, in per- 
 son, the central column of the Hungarians, struggled up 
 the steep ascent, on another point, and, uniting himself, 
 in great force, to the troops of Zrinii, poured, like a tor- 
 rent, upon the already staggering imperialists. Line 
 after line was broken, and, shortly, the whole battalion 
 fell into inextricable disorder. 
 
 " Now !" cried Zrinii, as he deployed, even in the very 
 face of the dispirited Austrians ; " now level your lances, 
 gentlemen, for another charge, and the day is our own ! 
 Talpra vitez !* St. Stephen for Hungary !" But the 
 enemy, apparently panic-struck, did not stand to en- 
 counter that fierce shock ; they gave way at all points, 
 and what remained of the right-wing, fairly fled the field. 
 
 The pursuit of the discomfited division was hotly fol- 
 lowed up by Zrinii, at the head of his own troop, and 
 that of Turascus, which pushed on without orders, and 
 the united force was swelled, by the accession of armed 
 peasantry, who now issued in great numbers from the 
 woods. It was in vain, that the general-in-chief, called 
 on Zrinii not to pursue his success too far, or too incau- 
 tiously. Hill, and hollow, vanished from under the hoofs 
 of his cavalry, and, heedless of the admonition, he was 
 out of hearing, slaughtering and dispersing all, who 
 would not accept of quarter. Five minutes might have 
 passed, and the sounds of battle were already receding 
 in the distance. Turascus drew in rein. Directing his 
 attention towards Coloswar; he glanced over the various 
 bodies of men-at-arms, that, scattered in every direction,

 surged to and fro, like the waves of ocean — as well as 
 the wreaths of eddying smoke permitted him to dis- 
 tinguish, he thought, he discovered an inexplicable 
 confusion in Castaldo's battle. Where, at that time, 
 waved the banner of Count Raoul ? He looked intently, 
 but, as Turascus supposed, owing to the sulphureous 
 screen that curtained the combatants, he could not des- 
 cry its broad pennon ; and yet it was evident to his 
 practised eye, that the centre of the imperialists had 
 been forced. Presently, as the flashes of fire gra- 
 dually became less frequent, the vaporous cloud, that 
 previously enveloped the scene of combat in its folds, 
 rolled lazily upward, before the light breeze, and the 
 Hungarian general could discern the vast mass, waving 
 like a troubled sea. Shortly, Hungarians and Austrians 
 confounded, either poured down into the valley, or 
 defiled along the chain of eminences, that conducted to- 
 wards the abbey of Coloswar. 
 
 " What, in the name of God !" thought Turascus, 
 "can that movement, made in apparent concert, mean?" 
 
 While he yet marvelled, and his heart began to feel 
 troubled within him, he suddenly remarked a horseman 
 galloping, at full speed, up the declivity. Turascus per- 
 ceiving him to be some aide-de-camp, and eager to hear 
 his communication, spurred his steed forwards to diminish 
 the distance between them. They met, — the officer was 
 Balthazar Zrinii, who, breathless and panting, for a mo- 
 ment could not speak — his horse was covered with foam and 
 gore, and staggering with fatigue, and gashed with wounds. 
 In his hand, he held a sword, reeking with blood — it 
 was a Spanish weapon, and had belonged to a foeman. 
 Turascus looked all he would ask ; his heart was rilled 
 with fearful forebodings, and his tongue refused its office. 
 
 "Where, my lord, are your troops, and those of my 
 father?" demanded Balthazar ; "lam sent to reclaim 
 them." 
 
 " To reclaim them !"

 " Ay, where is my father ?" 
 
 " In the full heat of pursuit," replied Turascus ; " far 
 ere this, from the annoyance of the enemy, or the sup- 
 port of Martinuzzi." 
 
 " Then," said Balthazar, " the game is up." 
 
 " Heavens !" returned Turascus, " what am I to augur 
 from your words ? How goes the field ?" 
 
 " Irretrievably lost." 
 
 *' Ha ! and counts Raoul and Pereny, where are 
 they ?" 
 
 "The one in Heaven — the other — but that matters 
 not : such of their followers as are not left lifeless on a 
 field of victory, or prisoners to a vanquished enemy, — 
 are forcing the battle of the regent." 
 
 " Balthazar, I implore you to speak intelligibly and in 
 few words." 
 
 " In one word, my Lord Turascus, treason. By trea- 
 son have the Counts Raoul and Pereny been done to 
 death. Not a man of the squadron is left to rally, — the 
 stay of our army, the cavalry of Quendi Ferens is cut to 
 pieces." 
 
 " And yonder column of Hungarians ?" said Tu- 
 rascus. 
 
 " Are under the orders of that fiend incarnate, who 
 killed Pereny," answered Balthazar. 
 
 " Fatal hearing !" cried Turascus ; " but hasten, Bal- 
 thazar, to recall your father — the body-guard of Marti- 
 nuzzi, must yet be whole, and it is not impossible the 
 day may be redeemed." 
 
 The young Zrinii sped on his mission. 
 
 "Oh, Hungaria! Hungaria !" said Turascus, inter- 
 nally, as he directed his way (necessarily circuitous) to- 
 wards the ground that Martinuzzi occupied. "Ever a prey 
 to the cankerworm of thine own dissensions, ruined by 
 thy very triumphs ! — at once thine enemies' terror, and 
 their victim !"

 Breathless aides-de-camp came galloping fast with their 
 disastrous tidings. The discomfiture and utter rout of 
 the left wing, — Count Raoul down, — the disorder of 
 Castaldo's centre, — the murder of his nephew, — the slan- 
 der, — the treason, — all these pieces of intelligence suc- 
 cessively pierced the attentive ear of Martinuzzi. He 
 saw that success was wrested out of his hands, by the 
 treachery of some few lords, and the easy credulity of 
 his troops ; still he relied on what Quendi Ferens would 
 accomplish, whose cavalry was flushed with victory. The 
 total disappointment of his hopes, in that regard, caused 
 him a most painful emotion at the heart. He cast his 
 far-seeing eye towards the scene of smoke and slaughter. 
 " They come on apace," he said, internally, " carrying 
 dismay and death in their train ; and I make small doubt 
 that Zrinii and Turascus, by this time, are far on their 
 way to the borders." At this thought, an expression of 
 impatience escaped him. 
 
 " Did your eminence speak V* said Balthazar. Zrinii, 
 who, just returned from the thickest of the fray, now 
 stood by the regent's side. 
 
 " Balthazar, prithee speed to my lord, your father, and 
 Count Turascus ; tell them, as they love the cause of 
 Hungary, to hie hither with the utmost despatch." 
 
 " Be assured," replied the gallant youth, "if I live, 
 my father's troops shall be brought into action within 
 two hours." He kept his word at the cost of his life. 
 
 Tury and Dobus were then ordered to bring up their 
 reserves, and occupy the fortified position of the abbey. 
 These troops, together with his own body-guard (the elite 
 of the army), and a portion of the wing of Count Horwith, 
 that had not hitherto been engaged, might amount to, 
 perhaps, ten thousand men, and made the entierty of the 
 force left to Martinuzzi, wherewith to oppose the fierce 
 onset of the imperialists, who, now, in their turn, were 
 assuming the offensive. They came on, indeed, in dread- 
 ful array, and terrible was the shock. Fiftv falconets

 and other pieces of ordnance, which Castaldo, owing to 
 the sudden and unexpected attack of the Hungarians, 
 had been unable, before, to bring into the field, were 
 now turned upon Martinuzzi's position, with tremendous 
 effect. Count Salm poured onwards, with his thousands 
 upon thousands, along the higher chain of ground, that 
 Raoul had before traversed, so fatally for himself and 
 followers. The fortifications of the abbey were assaulted, 
 by horse and foot, in the same instant. The slaughter 
 was dreadful, and extended far and wide. The ground 
 abutting on the banks of the divided Samos, deep dinted 
 with the tramp of man and steed, became plashed and 
 slippery with gore ; while the lazy tide, ensanguined 
 from the oozing wounds of drowning warriors, washed 
 the walls of the beleaguered city, with its blood-stained 
 waves. The Counts Dobus, Tury, and Horwith, fought 
 with desperate, but unavailing heroism ; holding out the 
 consecrated building, as if in very despite of fate. They 
 had planted a body of archers, on the abbey roof, who 
 poured a continual shower of missiles, on the heads of the 
 assailants. But the irresistible strength of Count Salm, 
 could not be longer withstood. The Hungarians were 
 driven in, the portals forced, and then, under his very 
 roof, the Deity might behold men, madly violating his 
 ordinance, and defacing his image. 
 
 And now, the spectral knight, raging like a whirlwind, 
 in the van of the insurgents, and supported by a body of 
 Spanish horse, having scaled, and carried the whole 
 length of heights, that fronted the Hungarian position, 
 hurled himself, with an impetuous impulse, and loud 
 shouts of anticipated triumph, on the firm and compact 
 battalion of Martinuzzi. The rebel ranks rolled on, 
 with the roar and violence of ocean, dashing its thousand 
 waves on the invulnerable rock. Fellow-subjects shed 
 each other's blood, in the name of their sovereign ; and 
 the nature of the adverse weapons, and the skill and 
 courage of those who wielded them, was equal on both

 sides. The phantom warrior, at their head, wrought pro- 
 digies of valour, mowing a path with his battle-axe, 
 which, on the Spanish horse endeavouring to follow up, 
 they would find the gap reclose, when the assailing force, 
 like a spent wave, would recoil upon the plain. And 
 now the archers, and slingers, who occupied the roof of 
 that sacred post, so often referred to, were cut to pieces, 
 and their places filled, by an Austrian force of like de- 
 scription. 
 
 Count Horwith was left for dead, and of the gallant 
 defenders, only two hundred survived, who endeavoured 
 to force their way, with Counts Dobus and Tury, towards 
 the impregnable plateau, where Martinuzzi had establish- 
 ed his phalanx. But every effort of the conquerors was 
 exerted to force that last and formidable post. Fire-balls 
 were discharged into the midst, and volley after volley of 
 musketry poured on the thick mass ; while missiles of 
 every description, showered down from the abbey battle- 
 ments, like aerial monsters, unintermittedly stooped upon 
 their prey. 
 
 The repeated onsets of the volunteer knight caused 
 terrible havoc, and in addition to this calamitous state of 
 things, Castaldo and Count Salm had formed their battle 
 anew, and now defiled, in terrific force, under cover of 
 the hillocks, and broken ground, which skirted the Sa- 
 mos, to take the regent in the rear. The spirits of the 
 imperialists had been raised to the highest pitch of en- 
 thusiasm by their commander, who told them, that the 
 enemy no longer fought for honour or victory, but for the 
 forlorn chance of retreat and safety. But not in that 
 hour, when, returning from his series of victorious fields, 
 he was met by the suppliant ambassadors of Ferdinand 
 and of Solyman, who, acknowledging his authority with 
 flattering professions, courted his alliance and solicited 
 his friendship, did Martinuzzi appear more calm, decided, 
 and collected than now, in this apparent extremity of his 
 fortunes. Amid this earthquake scene of confusion and

 uproar, encompassed by slaughter and dismay, he pre- 
 served his entire composure. His courage was as keen, 
 and presence of mind as undisturbed, as when he first 
 showed the Hungarians the glorious path of victory, and 
 himself led the way. Conspicuous by his superb Anato- 
 lian charger, and the national standard that he upheld, 
 he was seen towering onwards into the thickest of the 
 fight, and where he dwelt his blows, right and left, in- 
 evitable fate edged his trenchant blade. He had now 
 considerably contracted his circuit of defence, and rank 
 after rank of his unbroken battalion were levelled before 
 the untiring assaults of that unknown knight, the sweep 
 of whose flashing battle-axe seemed to emulate the scythe 
 of the fell destroyer, he personated. The fiery torrent 
 from afar, meanwhile, fell amongst the impenetrable, but 
 rapidly diminishing phalanx, like the gigantic hail that 
 came in aid of Joshua ; and with more than the valour 
 of that sword of Israel, but, it is to be feared, with none 
 other of his attributes, the spectral cavalier charged, and 
 charged again, slaying, and trampling down, and where- 
 ever he turned, scattering and defacing, with his irresis- 
 tible strokes, " the pomp of battle." Twice did Count 
 Dobus, who had literally cut his way to the regent's 
 assistance, over the dying and the dead, essay to oppose 
 himself to the progress of this prototype of death, and 
 as often, the tide of battle bore him past his mark. But 
 when the steel of their weapons next emitted sparks of 
 fire, the unknown knight turned upon him, with the 
 apparent resolution of not again parting with his perti- 
 nacious opponent. He aimed a deadly blow at the hel- 
 met of the Hungarian magnat : Count Dobus reeled, and 
 the arm of the invincible cavalier was raised to repeat 
 the stroke, when another sword was suddenly interposed. 
 " So, ho !" cried the voice of the fearful knight, who, 
 making a sort of sarcastic inclination of the head, con- 
 fronted with an horrific laugh his fresh assailant. " So,

 well, thou shalt die a soldier's death, since 'tis thy fancy. 
 There, old John Banffy, to the devil with thee !" 
 
 The hasty discharge of his carabine was the reply of 
 the Hungarian, which took effect, not on the person of 
 the mailed knight ; his charger sprang upwards, and then 
 plunged headlong on the plain. Even as the phantom 
 rider touched the earth, his unerring axe besprent the 
 thin grizzled hair of the aged chieftain with gore and 
 brains. Banffy fell, and the torrent of battle rolled over 
 him for a pall. None marked the veteran's end.* His 
 conqueror backed his war-horse. And now the conflict, 
 that had been sustained for several hours, deepened. 
 The thinned, but determined band of patriots serried 
 their ranks still closer, as if imbued with that courage, 
 and " longing after immortality," which inspired the 
 Getsef of yore.

 Their peculiar religious tenets were well adapted to excite to heroic 
 deeds ; nor, although they carried them to the verge of self-immolation, 
 do they stand alone in history in this respect. In other countries, and in 
 all ages, the soul's yearning after its proper immortality has produced simi- 
 lar effects. But that this faith, however exalted, should obtain such an influ- 
 ence over the imagination of any human being, as to prompt him, in cold 
 blood, to commit suicide, would, we think, be put out of the pale of pos- 
 sibilities, if one example at the least did not stand upon record. We do not 
 here allude to the Gymno- sophists, (who, Apuleius tells us, were wont, 
 when satiated with this life to prove their faith in the doctrine of the trans- 
 migration of the soul, by the ordeal of the flames) ; but to a lament which

 Answering every signal, word, or look of their beloved 
 regent, and faithful unto the end, they clung round the 
 
 cuse for the rash act of this zealot- We find, indeed, that Cato, on the 
 eve of putting an end to his existence, reverted to his favourite philo- 
 sophy, but such studies were not " the causer" of that haughty stoic's 
 death, at least not immediately. Besides, in his regard, there might be 
 pleaded a moral necessity (the avayKt]), which inferred the crjjfieiov or 
 permission of his genius,. . " the divinity which stirred within ; " the ap- 
 prehension of disgrace, the to aidrjjxov, insisted on afterwards in Epictetus 
 and Marcus Antoninus; the aij^vvij, which (if inevitable) constituted 
 the third limitation of Plato, and which, as Cicero observed, was pecu- 
 liarly applicable to the gravitas, or, as Dion renders it, the tx v P°7 V( °- 
 fiovvvi] of Cato. So that even St. Augustine, when he professedly 
 inveighs against " self-slaughter," makes a special exception in favour of 
 "the fact" of him of Uttica. De Civ. Dei, lib. vi. 26. But, contrari- 
 wise, the deed of the fanatic, Cleombrotus, was utterly unjustifiable, on 
 the very grounds, wherefore it was enacted. According to the Platonic 
 hypothesis, this man rendered himself guilty of the piacular (3ia ; sub- 
 jecting his immaterial part eternally to the demons of v\rj, (as the soul 
 of Samuel was temporarily molested by the witch of Endor, ..the sepa- 
 rated soul being obnoxious to such evocation of demons or necroman- 
 cers was the origin, according to St. Justin Martyr, of the prayers of the 
 church for the departed) ; ranking among the Biathanatoi, such as for-

 Cicero's Somnium Scipionis, " Quia spes sicut timor passio est ;" for 
 ever ascending from the gkotoq t^wrtpoc;, into heaven. These passions 
 were the corpora pestes of Virgil ; the kivviq in the oracles, the Kt]peg 
 in Philo and elsewhere, the material faeculencies of the fathers. Cicero's 
 words, in the work above-cited, are decisive of his reading of Plato. 
 "Nisi Deus hie, cujus hoc templum est, omne quod conspicis, istis te 
 corporis custodiis liberaverit, hue tibi aditus patere non potest." 
 
 What abortive enthusiasm ! for a man to sacrifice his life through faith

 martyrdom, whereby he trusted to anticipate his felicity, interposed a 
 perpetual barrier from the habitation of the blessed. Our blessed Sa-

 term of commendation. — See Matthew, chap. xi. ver. 12, and St. Luke

 standard of their country, as if (like a parent who watches 
 over, striving to avert, the mortal agony of his child,) 
 they had never dreamed till that moment, how devotedly 
 they loved it. 
 
 Count Turascus, who, for some time had joined the 
 battle, now reached the side of Martinuzzi. His face 
 and clothes were marked with blood, his right arm, shat- 
 tered, lay hanging by his side ; with his left, he wielded 
 his sword. 
 
 " What thinkest thou," said the recent, " will Count 
 Zrinii yet return to aid us in this strait ?" 
 
 Turascus mournfully shook his head. " If," he replied, 
 " some accident had not occurred, Count Zrinii would 
 have made his force available, ere this."

 The felo de se of the Ambraciot, cannot, therefore, be palliated by 
 the authority of Plato. When Lord Byron talks, in Don Juan, of what 
 his "confounded phantasies" had "paved the way to," suicide was 
 not in his contemplation. The truth is, however, on reconsideration, 
 (and such a latitude have the exceptions) that the Phaedon of that philoso- 
 pher, might be made to tell either way, according to the predisposition 
 of the reader. The religious phrenzy of the Donatists in the middle of 
 the fourth century, as related by Tillemont from Augustin, Mem. Eccles.

 from that we have under review, by many shades of difference. These

 who, for what we can see, comprehended all the Getaa noith of the Da-

 Wars. A passage, in book, headed PUMAIKQN IAAYPIKH, de- 
 scribes the terror, with which the defeat of Cornelius filled all Italy. And 
 still later, such was the sensation caused by their hostile incursions, that, 
 to cite the words of Paterculus, " It stabilem ilium et firmatum tanto- 
 rum belloium experientia Crcsaris Augusti animum quateiet atque ter-

 the ancestors of the brave men, who stood by Martinuzzi in the battle 
 of Coloswar. c 5

 streamed through every pore of his hacked harness, and 
 whose horse's flank and poitrei were struck through with 
 arrows, was observed, darting towards the spot with 
 amazing velocity, and he only drew in bridle, as the last 
 spring of his reeling steed placed him by the side of the 
 regent. 
 
 "Your father? — his squadron? — where is the left 
 wing ?" demanded Turascus, with breathless eagerness. 
 
 " Deserted, to a man !" faintly replied Balthazar 
 Zrinii, — for it was he. " My father is made prisoner; 
 and I — " The gallant and martyred messenger sunk 
 senseless on the earth. 
 
 "Count Turascus," observed Martinuzzi, in a calm voice, 
 and with that slight, but resolved smile, which bespoke 
 the soul collected in itself, " when men can do no more, 
 they must needs yield to fate. I would fain, if possible, 
 accomplish a retreat on Coloswar, while still these few 
 remaining gallant fellows are left to me ; but, so con- 
 tagious appears this fatal spirit of defection, that I even 
 question, whether the madness have not reached the for- 
 tress. Besides, Mirce, the surviving castellan, is the 
 
 creature of ; no matter. Count Turascus, I were 
 
 loath to risk the ensign I carry, by stirring from this post, 
 unless I were assured, the beleaguered fortress, which I 
 have vainly striven to relieve, presented a place of re- 
 fuge." 
 
 " Allow me, your eminence, to do your errand," said 
 Turascus. 
 
 " Ever daring as thou art honourable !" cried Mar- 
 tinuzzi, — " with thanks I accept your proffer. " 
 
 The count, putting his horse into motion, bowed. 
 Martinuzzi observed him turn pale and totter ; a bullet, 
 at that instant, had struck him mortally ; he dropped 
 from his horse. " Hungaria !" inarticulately murmured 
 on the lip of the patriot, and his last draught of vital 
 air was drawn in the effort. 
 
 " Death, this day, is holding his revels," half spoke,

 half thought, Martinuzzi. " Prithee," he said, ad- 
 dressing- himself to one of his aides-de-camp, " try to 
 ride down to the gates of Coloswar, and ascertain their 
 disposition within the walls, — you understand me ?" 
 
 The young officer signified his comprehension and obe- 
 dience, and rode furiously off in the direction of the city. 
 The patriots still stood their last rallying ground, like so 
 many lions at bay. A fierce, and impenetrable front, 
 did this impacted body of devoted men present, to the 
 repeated charges of the imperialists, while, what was 
 most painful to the feelings of Martinuzzi, the insurgent 
 Hungarians closed, with shouts of defiance, on their 
 countrymen. 
 
 " Strange ! that angel should with angel war, 
 And in fierce hostings meet."* 
 
 And now, the squadrons of Castaldo and Count Salm, 
 having wheeled round the brow of the hill, assailed his 
 iron ranks in the rear. Corps after corps did the marquis 
 bring up, in person, to support his furious and repeated 
 attacks, which, like the successive billows of a tem- 
 pestuous ocean, at length breached the bulwark of the 
 Hungarian phalanx. Martinuzzi threw himself among 
 the broken troops ; he was warmly seconded by Count 
 Dobus, and, animated by the exhortations and example 
 of their leaders, the brave defenders of their country 
 were nerved with triple vigour. The imperialists were 
 beaten back ; but, in the impetuous heat of the fight, 
 Martinuzzi had involved himself in the adverse ranks, 
 and was surrounded. Never, since the standard of Hun- 
 gary first heavily oped and closed its silken volumes, had 
 it been in such danger, as at this moment. Many a 
 lance was directed against the regent, and many an arm 
 was stretched forth to clutch the stave of that banner, 
 whose ample folds now drooped to the ground. Mar- 
 tinuzzi backed his horse in the midst of this threatening

 storm. The two Austrian leaders encouraged their men 
 to press forward. The foremost of these celebrated cap- 
 tains resolutely opposed himself to Martinuzzi, who well 
 knew his adversary, — it was Castaldo. The sight seemed 
 to inspire the regent with the courage and strength of 
 a host. "Ambassador!" he exclaimed, with taunting 
 indignation, " take thy reward I" and the spear of the 
 marquis was shattered in shivers. Setting his teeth hard, 
 Martinuzzi pressed his advantage, and, the next instant, 
 the blood of the Italian general stained his falchion. 
 Castaldo closed upon his antagonist, and, in the fierce 
 grapple which ensued, snatched at the jewelled hilt of a 
 dirk, that hung in Martinuzzi's vesture. He drew it 
 forth, but, even while the weapon gleamed on high, sense 
 and soul alike reeled, and the blow fell wide of its mark. 
 The fainting Italian sunk to the ground, wounded, but 
 not mortally. Meanwhile, the warlike prelate would 
 have fallen back upon his battalion, but again his retreat 
 was intercepted by a hostile arm. Martinuzzi closed 
 upon this fresh adversary. The combat was of short du- 
 ration, — only a few strokes were parried on either side, 
 ere the steel cap of the Austrian was cleft, from plume 
 to gorget. Thus perished the Count de Salm, the se- 
 cond in command of the imperialists. 
 
 By this time, the Count Dobus and others, who saw 
 the danger in which the standard was placed, had pushed 
 beyond the Hungarian ranks, to extricate the regent from 
 his difficulty. In this they fully succeeded. The im- 
 perialists were forced back, but, just as Martinuzzi was 
 disengaged from the hostile press, he found, he had to 
 encounter an unlooked-for antagonist. A war-charger, 
 clearing the lances of the enemy, and bursting through 
 the protending spears of a thousand foemen, bore right 
 onward, from one end of the panic-struck battalion to 
 the other. Wielding, with Herculean strength, his tre- 
 mendous battle-axe, the rider smote and overthrew all 
 before him, down a broad lane, cleared through whole

 ranks of his opponents, trampling on the living, the 
 dying-, and the dead, with like indifference ; nor did he 
 draw in rein, till the noble animal he bestrode, leaping 
 forwards four yards at a bound, fairly planted him along- 
 side of the royal standard. " Turn thee, cardinal !" he 
 shouted, in a voice louder than the loud battle, — " turn 
 and meet thy fate !" 
 
 Martinuzzi fronted the challenger, and beheld that 
 image of death, swinging around his head, his dreadful 
 battle-axe; in person unwounded, and unscathed, but 
 having his coat-of-mail dyed, in one hue incarnadine, 
 from plume to spur. For the first time during that ter- 
 rible fight, the countenance of Martinuzzi lost the entire 
 tranquillity, which all along, till then, had sat upon it. 
 His brow slightly flushed, and he hastily raised his arm, 
 as if to accept the challenge, but, in a moment, seeming 
 to recollect himself, he lowered his weapon again, say- 
 ing, in a low, deep, and almost melancholy tone, " Count 
 Ragotzy, tempt me not, — you may not meet your death 
 from my hand, nor /, mine from thine /" 
 
 With these words, and casting on his challenger a 
 transitory glance of indescribable emotion, he turned 
 away ; and, at that moment, Count Dobus again threw 
 himself across the brigand's path, and attacked him hand 
 to hand. Brief was the combat; the Hungarian was 
 prostrated, by a deep wound on the skull, and the 
 thickening throng of battle bore the victor onward. 
 Dealing death on all sides, he himself escaped from 
 every effort against his life ; so that he seemed, as was 
 fabled of certain of the Dii indicjeles* of old, to be cased 
 or circumfuscd in some invulnerable armature. Many a 
 gallant spirit his prowess hurried to bliss or bane, and 
 the Counts Horwith and Tury, who had singled him out, 
 
 * Dii indigetes.— What rank should he allotted to these amphihious 
 immortals, is still, we believe, a question. Cicero (lib. ii. de Legib.)

 in hopes that their combined strength might stop his 
 desolating career, were both, nearly at the same instant, 
 prostrated from their seats, and left for dead by their 
 invincible adversary. The affrighted ranks staggered, or 
 drew aside, wherever the stream of victorious battle 
 chanced to bear the spectral cavalier, and soon an ob- 
 scure and terrible rumour spread through the horrified 
 battalion. The belief arose, and grew, and gathered on 
 all sides, that no mortal arm wielded that clottered 
 battle-axe ; but that the emblematic panoply shrouded 
 some departed warrior, upon whose impassable front, 
 blade and bullet were spent in vain. 
 
 " I know that chap too well," remarked a serjeant of 
 the body-guard, in a hushed whisper, to his nearest com- 
 rade, — " let's turn our swords on vulnerable stuff. Such 
 as he, without flesh and blood, is no safe subject for 
 cold iron. Stand on one side, — these ghosts ever keep 
 to aright line, for all the world, like a mad wolf-dog." 
 
 "You know him?" repeated the other, — " how can 
 that be ?" 
 
 " I mean," replied the serjeant, grasping the shoulder 
 of the man with a convulsive strength, that contributed 
 not a little to impress his fellow-comrade, with the like 
 superstitious terror, which had obtained the mastery over 
 his own bosom ; " I have set eyes on him before ; — he's 
 one of the familiar spirits of Father Dominick ; there be 
 three of them. Many a night, and oft, I've seen them hold 
 communion without the walls, when I have kept guard 
 on the ramparts of Hermanstadt, — only think of that !" 
 
 The man did think of it, and speak of it too, and the 
 wild report went shuddering through the ranks, that 
 Father Dominick, or some spirit incarnate, linked and 
 mated with him in unutterable league, was in the field. 
 What fire and sword failed to accomplish, this petrifying 
 persuasion wrought in an instant. Men, whom no mor- 
 tal odds could terrify, felt their hearts collapse at the 
 apprehension of having to encounter this single intren- 
 chant enemy.

 The panic, that followed, became universal, and made 
 the climax of the day's reverses. An electric chill ran 
 through the hearts of all ; the men fled not indeed, be- 
 cause, on every side, they were encompassed ; nor did 
 they offer to surrender, partly, for that the phantom 
 knight had set up his cry of " Point-de-quarticr /" and 
 partly, because they were a brave and well-disciplined 
 body of men, to whom the idea of yielding was worse 
 than death ; but they fought on to little purpose ; — their 
 moral courage was prostrated, and they suffered them- 
 selves to be slaughtered, like a flock of sheep. The 
 common soldiers stood inactive, and waited the repeated 
 charges of the imperial cavalry, in sullen and silent 
 despair, while many of the first nobility of Hungary be- 
 came so many voluntary sacrifices, and, with dreadful 
 yell, precipitated themselves on the protended lances of 
 their foes, " as eager to anticipate their grave." 
 
 In this general ruin, one man at least stood firm, and 
 what skill and valour could accomplish, to arrest the 
 flood of victory, was put forth by Martinuzzi, on this 
 memorable day, — his presence was in all parts of the field, 
 and he communicated his spirit in a voice, that outrang 
 the fierce elements of battle, rising audibly over the 
 thunders of war, and the sustained and redoubled shouts 
 of the assailing force— his flag waved its volumes over his 
 few and last adherents, like some precious talisman. 
 Fainting with fatigue and wounds, the Hungarian patriot 
 would murmur cheers and blessings, as Martinuzzi 
 passed, and even the sunken eyes of such, as lay gasping 
 in the last agony, would seek out, through the film of 
 death, that consecrated banner. They viewed it, as the 
 type of hope and consolation, bearing the assurance to 
 their departing spirits, that, however they had lived, they 
 at least had fallen holily, and had spilt their blood, not 
 vainly, presenting, in the manner of their death, the most 
 sacred spectacle to Heaven that earth can exhibit ; — that 
 of patriots perishing together, in God's name, in defence 
 of their country. The regent of Hungary was vaulting

 into the seat of the fourth steed, he had that day bestrode, 
 when the scout, he had sent forth to collect intelligence, 
 pressed to his side. 
 
 " Now, gallant gentleman and true, how goes it in the 
 city ?" demanded Martinuzzi. 
 
 " I regret to report to your eminence, that the gates 
 of Coloswar are closed against you. Mirce threatens, 
 that the guns of the defences will be opened, indiscri- 
 minately, on your force, and on that of Piadena, under 
 the absurd pretence of holding out the fortress for the 
 Lady Czerina." 
 
 " I feared as much," rejoined Martinuzzi, l( but do 
 not," he added, putting his finger on his lips, " speak of 
 this to others, gallant sir, — and since we are precluded 
 from all succour in that quarter, let us make the last 
 battle field of Hungary remembered." Saying these words, 
 Martinuzzi galloped into the hottest of the fight. 
 
 His battle array was by this time fearfully diminished — 
 thousands upon thousands of his best troops had fallen, 
 and his little phalanx, now almost entirely composed of 
 gentlemen of descent, environed by a superior and 
 victorious enemy., was melting away before their haras- 
 sing and destructive operations, like some alpine mound, 
 under solstitial sunshine. Once, for an anxious moment, 
 the thought of capitulation crossed the regent's mind ; it 
 came like a ghost unbidden, and was exorcised with in- 
 dignation, by that spirit of patriotism, that welled up 
 from the bottom of his soul, like holy incense. " Not 
 while this arm can carry its honourable charge," he said 
 internally ; " the royal banner, that for so many centuries 
 hath braved the battle, through fortune and defeat, shall 
 not in its last agony, be dishonoured by Martinuzzi." 
 
 At that moment, he was again confronted by the Cygani 
 leader, — he frowned, and waving his hand in wrath, 
 would have turned his horse's head in another direction, 
 but Count Ragotzy persisted in accosting him. 
 
 " My lord cardinal," he hissed in the regent's ear, 
 " hearken to me — even in this hour of apparent ruin," he

 proceeded, in a breathless whisper, " I can avert your 
 fate. On one condition, I will bear you and your fol- 
 lowers from the field, in safety, if not in triumph. A 
 word of mine, that I could speak to these Hungarians, 
 who have turned upon you, would make them return to 
 their allegiance. Shall I speak that word ?" 
 
 " Thou ! — no ! Ingrate ! and yet name your condition !" 
 
 " That you will exert all the authority hereafter vested in 
 you, whether as regent or king, to hunt down the false 
 madman, who calls himself Count Rodna, to death — 
 mark me — to death !" 
 
 Martinuzzi was strangely struck. After a minute's 
 pause, he replied, " I reject safety on such terms." 
 
 Count Ragotzy bit his lip. — "Well then, cardinal," he 
 said, " come with me; I will bear you and the standard 
 of Hungary, through the fray unharmed." 
 
 " And these my gallant soldiers V* 
 
 " Let them perish in their obstinacy," replied Ragotzy. 
 
 " That thou wert brave, I knew," said Martinuzzi with 
 indignant vehemence, " but I guessed not till this mo- 
 ment, how daring. — Propose such terms to me ! Out of 
 my sight, audacious !" 
 
 " Thou art doomed, cardinal," muttered Count Ragotzy, 
 through his clenched teeth. " Thy last chance thrown 
 away, nor heaven, earth, nor hell, can save thee now." 
 He turned away to his deluded troops — " Charge ! fol- 
 lowers of Raoul !" he exclaimed, " and wrest your stan- 
 dard from the grasp of the tyrant!" 
 
 The incendiary Hungarians charged anew, seconded by 
 a final assault of the imperialists; who, at thesame time, 
 however, solicited their enemies to accept of quarter. 
 In the melee, Martinuzzi's horse sunk under him. He 
 was instantly raised, and assisted by the officers of his 
 staff to another steed, and the rent " evolvements" of 
 the standard of Hungary again swung over this little body 
 of devoted men, . . but its silken folds were now envermeiled 
 with the regent's blood ; and his voice grew fainter, and 
 his spear waved languidly ; as he was remounting, — he had

 been wounded in his side by a musket shot, — in his eager- 
 ness, he at first hardly regarded it, but soon afterwards, 
 he felt himself every moment becoming feebler and feebler. 
 
 And now the tragedy of that bloody day seemed ap- 
 proaching its catastrophe. At whatever sacrifice of life, 
 Austria had obtained the victory, the result would be 
 more than equivalent. Skilfully improved, the whole 
 country would be laid open to the conqueror, Coloswar 
 must surrender, and Ferdinand — "yes," thought Castaldo, 
 as debilitated from his wounds, he rested in his camp in 
 a distant part of the field, every moment expecting to 
 receive the intelligence of the surrender, or death of the 
 regent. "Yes ; Ferdinand will owe to me the acquisition of 
 Transylvania !" Even as these words murmured on his lips, 
 he heard the clatter of horses' hoofs. It came on like the 
 sound of a torrent, — there was some confusion without 
 the marquee. " They bring me an account of the 
 victory," he exultingly exclaimed, " and have come to 
 present to me the standard of Hungary." Weak as he 
 was, he started to his feet, eager to be certified of the 
 reality of his triumph ; and, with an air of military gran- 
 deur, advanced a step, to welcome the glorious trophy. 
 
 " Guard the entrance !" exclaimed a loud and com- 
 manding voice, and at the instant, a knight, clad in a 
 complete suit of mail, with his sword drawn, passed 
 hastily into the tent. The vizor of his helmet was up, 
 and displayed a countenance, eloquent of high thoughts, 
 and lofty daring. He was young, very young, and on 
 every conspicuously handsome feature was stamped the 
 genuine lines of nobility, virtue, and intelligence. This 
 unknown chieftain moved towards Castaldo, with the 
 quick and assured step of an equal, if not a superior. 
 
 " Marquis of Piadena," he commenced, after a slight 
 salutation, and in a tone of stern formality; " your army, 
 to a man, is in my power: if you would save a needless 
 effusion of blood, you will send orders that your troops 
 lay down their arms, — for yourself, my lord, you are my 
 prisoner."

 Castaldo gazed on the noble shape, — the well propor- 
 tioned limbs, and splendid accoutrements of his visitor 
 vacantly, like one stunned. " What mean you? — I un- 
 derstand you not. Who, in the name of God, are you, 
 sir V he exclaimed, with some incoherency, turning pale, 
 and in the very excess of consternation. 
 
 " I have no time to spare for words," answered the 
 chieftain: — "Enough, my lord; your auxiliaries, un- 
 der Don Leon, have already yielded to superior num- 
 bers. Count Zrinii and Quendi Ferens are freed, and, 
 at the head of their liberated countrymen, are charging 
 down the hill, — Count Nadastis, and those who went 
 over to you with him, have declared against you, and 
 will shortly recover the Abbey of Coloswar. I have ten 
 thousand brave fellows under my individual command, — 
 my lord, I say, — enough. Will you send orders to your 
 forces to surrender?" 
 
 Castaldo would have expostulated, — " If I understand ; 
 allow me time," he began in breathless anxiety. 
 
 " Take your own time, my lord, — mine is too precious to 
 waste with you, in further emparlance. I must break this 
 conference short. The imperialists may receive quarter, 
 what time they choose to ask for it, — but no honours of 
 war, guns, baggage, colours, military stores, — all must 
 be delivered over into my possession. Every man must 
 yield himself prisoner of war. These are the terms of 
 capitulation, which you may accept, when you think 
 proper. You have my last word, — adieu, — au revoir." 
 
 The unknown officer quitted the tent. The high 
 ground without was covered with men-at-arms, formed in 
 battle array. 
 
 " My brave friends and followers !" cried the young 
 knight, addressing himself to these ; " the kingdom of 
 Hungary has been basely betrayed, and is in danger 
 of destruction. Will you accompany me to her deliver- 
 ance!" A loud shout of acquiescence was the answer. 
 " Many among you," continued the cavalier; " were born 
 in this province, — many themselves are sons of Hungary

 I, your Richter, first saw the light in Buda. I swear 
 that Austria, with my consent, shall never swallow up 
 my native country. Such is my will. Is it your deter- 
 mination also?" Another shout of acclamation made the 
 required response. " Then, forward, my gallant followers 
 to the rescue! — the national ensign yet waves on high. 
 Blessed be the hand that upholds that stave!— ay," he 
 murmured to himself; "though the hand should be 
 his, — upon them! while that flag is still unfurled. Ad- 
 vance banner ! — forward ! — and voice aloud the war-cry, 
 whose acclaim hath never yet been followed by defea- 
 ture, — send the word through the ranks, — the Richter 
 I wan! I wan, and victory!" 
 
 The whole troop gave back the terrible thunder of 
 those sounds, and dashing adown the valley in a compact 
 mass, the shout was wafted by a thousand voices on the 
 wind to heaven, — "The Vilez Iwan to the rescue ! — 
 Twan for Hungary! — Iwan and victory!" 
 
 Wounded and faint, Martinuzzi with difficulty sat his 
 horse, with difficulty he held the standard aloft, but 
 however exhausted, he did uphold it. His men fought 
 no longer for victory or safety ; but for honourable 
 death. The battle relaxed on all sides, — the imperialists 
 seemed weary of slaying ; and the Hungarians, though 
 they would not yield, scarcely offered any resistance. 
 Suddenly, the regent's eye was attracted by an unusual 
 appearance beyond the brow of the hill, where the Aus- 
 trians had been posted in the beginning of the action. 
 Columns of vast power, and apparently extensive depth, 
 appeared partially visible among the interstices of the 
 wooded country, in the distance. Whilst nearer, living 
 masses of men, to be counted apparently by thousands, 
 were seen emerging from the defiles of the undulating 
 ground. The countenance of Martinuzzi instantly be- 
 came radiant, as that of an angel. 
 
 " Do my senses deceive me?" he said, addressing 
 himself to Count Barcotius, who, observing his weakness, 
 had just vainly proffered his aid, to relieve him of the

 banner; " or does not yonder apparition, on the hill- 
 edge, take the form of armed men ? And, among them, do 
 I not descry the troop of Zrinii, hastening to our assist- 
 ance ?" 
 
 11 It seems so, indeed, your eminence," replied Barco- 
 tius ; " what miracle can this be ?" 
 
 " Here is one who may perhaps explain," said Mar- 
 tinuzzi, as an aide-de-camp, who had fought his way to 
 their side, came up. 
 
 " If your highness can stand your ground for many 
 minutes longer," said the officer; " Count Zrinii will 
 operate a diversion in your favour, — his battle is re- 
 ordered, — the Moldavian Richter is in the field, — and 
 the day is your own." 
 
 Martinuzzi bowed his head. " Glory to God," he said, 
 with affecting solemnity, and turned his horse away, to 
 conceal his emotion. 
 
 " The Moldavian Richter," repeated Barcotius ; " who, 
 or what is he?" 
 
 " Iwan, whom the people surname, the Vilez, — et alter 
 Mars ut istivolunt,"* replied the messenger; " he comes 
 on in formidable array. The imperialists must be anni- 
 hilated." 
 
 He augured truly. Already wearied with their long 
 and obstinate struggle, and surrounded, as by miracle, 
 by an enemy, they had looked upon as vanquished ; con- 
 siderably reduced in numbers, — their Spanish allies ad- 
 mitted to quarter,. . the second in command fallen,.. 
 Castaldo a prisoner. And deprived of their principal 
 officers, who could alone inspirit them to prolong the 
 fight, — there now appeared no other resource to the im- 
 perialists, than surrender. 
 
 As matters stood, the liberated corps d'armee of Zrinii, 
 Quendi Ferens, and Nadastis, would have amply redeem-

 ed the day, without the accession of Richter Iwan's force, 
 " fresh, vigorous, and invincible."* The imperialists 
 threw down their arms, by hundreds and by thousands, 
 and the whole face of the field was utterly reversed. 
 Here and there, indeed, a few isolated bodies of men 
 were seen, obstinately contending against overwhelming 
 odds ; and the insurgent Hungarians, either through very 
 spleen, or the sense of their having taken an irretrievable 
 step, persevered in their resistance ; but, with these ex- 
 ceptions, the battle came to a pause. 
 
 The representations of the Hungarian magnats had 
 speedily excited the inhabitants of Coloswar, to take up 
 arms against their castellan. He was cast into prison, 
 and the city portals were thrown open, to receive the long 
 file of prisoners of war, and the wounded, and the dying 
 of both armies. 
 
 Till now, Martinuzzi had borne up manfully against 
 his increasing exhaustion ; but when the fortune of war, 
 after all her vacillation, seemed to pronounce so unequi- 
 vocally in his favour, the energy, which had hitherto sup- 
 ported him, failed. On the brink of insensibility, he 
 sunk upon his saddle. At that moment, certain princi- 
 pal captains of the Moldavians rode up. One, a little 
 a-head of the others, moved his horse forwards, that he 
 might relieve the regent of the standard. Martinuzzi felt 
 himself waxing sensibly weaker, but only held the colours 
 nearer to him, and with a firmer grasp. 
 
 "Where," said the regent, " is Barcotius? Where 
 Horwith ? Where " His voice was lost in faintness. 
 
 " Your eminence," said the vizored captain, " entrust 
 me with the royal ensign, and I will uphold it for the 
 honour of Hungary." 
 
 "Ha! what voice is that ?" said Martinuzzi. " Where 
 are my officers ? Who art thou, sir ?" 
 
 " I am the Moldavian Richter — my name is Iwan," 
 answered the chief, slightly inclining his head, and mak- 
 ing a motion to receive the banner.

 " Would I were stronger, to express my thanks, noble 
 sir, for this hour's deliverance," said Martinuzzi ; " but 
 for the standard, though its charge were short of your 
 deservings, I can transfer it to no hands, not owing alle- 
 giance to Hungary ; and thou, I trow, dost not lay claim 
 to be a subject of these realms?" 
 
 "A subject? — not a subject" replied Iwan. 
 
 "To our sorrow, most gallant gentleman ; thy splendid 
 reputation knolls in the ear o' the land, and the highest 
 rank in Hungary shall be thine. The diet, doubtless, 
 will not be backward to confer on you the rights of citi- 
 zenship ; * and we hope, but not now — Barcotius, take 
 thou the ensign, for I am sick with the loss of blood, and 
 bear me to Coloswar, and " 
 
 Too spent to utter more, Martinuzzi resigned the flag- 
 staff into the hands of Count Barcotius, and was carried 
 off the ground, almost in a state of unconsciousness. 
 
 Meanwhile, the rebel Hungarians fought like men, who 
 were conscious, that the mortal blight of rebellion stained 
 their cause. The Cygani leader, who seemed to multiply 
 himself by the rapidity of his movements, soon carried 
 the like awe into the breasts of his fresh antagonists, as 
 that, with which he had inspired the troops of Martinuzzi. 
 He had exchanged his former weapon for a falchion, 
 which flamed in the van of his own battle, and in the 
 dense ranks of the enemy, like the trenchant sword of 
 the destroying angel. The same wild report, that had 
 before paralyzed men's arms, and drank up their courage, 
 got wind, and sat like an electric spell on the whole Mol- 
 davian army. Ably seconded by his insurgent force, he 
 produced such an impression on the enemy's ranks, that 
 at length they were compelled to yield ground. None 
 dared stand to encounter inevitable death, and since the 
 celerity of the knight's movements endowed him with all

 the advantage and appearance of ubiquity, panic and 
 disorder were presently wrought in the Moldavian ranks, 
 many fled outright, leaving death and dismay behind 
 them, while Count Ragotzy, rejoicing in his invulnera- 
 bility, rode on over the red field of slaughter, smiting, 
 and slaying, and trampling down, under his horse's 
 hoofs, like some avenging deity. 
 
 " Oh ! where was • I wan' then 1 
 One blast upon his bugle horn 
 Were worth a thousand men." * 
 
 And where is Iwan ? Imagining that his presence 
 would not be required in aid of a victory, that, from the all 
 but universal surrender of the enemy, he deemed already 
 gained, he had left his army in the command of one of his 
 officers, and, escorted by a small troop, had entered the 
 fortress of Coloswar, to transact an important matter, 
 the particulars of which, so far as are necessary to be 
 known, the reader may presently learn. 
 
 Meanwhile, Count Ragotzy brandished his terrible 
 falchion, right and left, against the slackening foe. Two 
 of the commanding officers of the Moldavians had suc- 
 cessively forfeited their lives, in the act of rallying their 
 broken troops, and shortly, a third, encouraging his men 
 to stand the assault of Ragotzy, placed himself, right in 
 the path of the invincible leader, as if ambitious of en- 
 countering death, from the same unrelenting hand. 
 
 Ragotzy remarked the enemy forming anew, and, 
 discovering the cause, in the exhortations of the vizored 
 officer, who now threw himself into the gap of battle, 
 thus in haughty tones bespoke his new 7 opponent : 
 
 " Sir knight, set not the men a bad example, but let 
 them make off as they best may, and do thou take the 
 lead ; trust me, I shall not spare thee for thy youthfulness, 
 for I have vowed, this day, my sword to embrue in the 
 blood of all who oppose my passage, thy lack of beard

 is no saving clause, look to it, and let thy horse's hoofs 
 manifest thy wit." 
 
 " I cannot, courteous ruffian, take thy counsel," re- 
 turned the knight ; " you wear a cognizance, in your 
 helmet, that sets my heart on fire, and which I am bound 
 to challenge, — that gory tartan!'' 
 
 " Ha !" exclaimed Ragotzy, " then thou art " 
 
 The noble form of the knight, seemed to dilate into 
 majesty. " I am called," he said, in a fierce, and some- 
 what proud tone, and griping his sword firmly, "the 
 Richter Iwan, and there's thy glove ! Villain ! more 
 murderous and inhuman, than tongue can proclaim thee, 
 take, from this arm, the hoarded vengeance of a life. 
 Stand to thy guard !" 
 
 Count Ragotzy backed his horse some paces, and then 
 cried out, after a laugh of derision ; " By the souls of 
 the slain ! I am in luck to-day. Yet, prithee, a last word, 
 ere your tongue wag less fiercely. There is among your 
 followers, a flighty kanactz, — the same, I mean, who 
 bore you my gage. I have sought him in the field, in 
 vain. Where is that man ?" 
 
 " I deign not to parley with thee, homicide," replied 
 Iwan, again spurring his steed forward. 
 
 " Oh, well !" said Ragotzy ; '* since thy blood is so 
 fiery, I'll cool it for thee ; and when thou meetest the 
 shade of the heroic Peter, say to him, that Alaric Polgar 
 thus avenged his fall." 
 
 Uttering these words, the Cygani leader couched his 
 lance, and plunging the rowels in his charger, precipi- 
 tated himself on the richter with such sudden impetu- 
 osity, as to bear down horse and rider in the shock. He 
 had been met, however, as fiercely ; his own steed was 
 overthrown, and he lay rolling on the greensward. In- 
 stantaneously, as it were, these two bold and untamed 
 spirits were seen, foot to foot, on the blood-strewn plain! 
 There they stood, fronting one another, in rigid and un- 
 yielding attitude, both animated with the same rcsolu-

 tion, of not letting his opponent escape his vengeance. 
 For more than a minute, each regarded the other with 
 stern and steady gaze, but the soul of neither quailed, 
 in the least, before his formidable antagonist. At length 
 Count Ragotzy broke the spell of this exquisite tableau, 
 by suddenly attempting a pass. It was parried, and the 
 fio-ht was renewed ; — surely never, before or since, were 
 such accomplished swordsmen, so equally matched. Per- 
 haps, however, this equality would not have existed, had 
 not Ragotzy been somewhat wearied, with so many hours 
 hard fighting. As it was, it long appeared impossible 
 to infer victory or defeat, on either side. Both comba- 
 tants entertained such respect for their antagonist's 
 powers, that they refrained from putting forth the entire 
 of their strength, or risking the event of the duel, by 
 attempting any premature and unguarded pass, which, 
 if it missed its attaint, would probably be fatally requited. 
 Thus the combat presented a pure exhibition of skill and 
 power, between these respective champions of the two 
 armies, and so completely was it felt, that on the result 
 of this single passage, must depend the issue of the ge- 
 neral action, that their followers, on either side, hung 
 over the combat in anxious suspense, and, as by some 
 tacit understanding, gave over fighting. 
 
 It seemed, however, that Count Ragotzy 's tempera- 
 ment ill endured the continued admonishment, with 
 which his science and experience sought to bridle his 
 natural impetuosity; he made more than one passado, 
 which, though they were avoided by the other's dexte- 
 rous swordsmanship, the richter's instant aim of advan- 
 taging by their failure, was, in turn, baffled by the equal 
 agility and promptitude of his adversary. No blood 
 had yet been drawn on either side, when, grown indig- 
 nant, at the unwonted circumstance of being held so 
 long at sword's point, by a single foeman, and, probably, 
 emboldened by the impunity which attended his previous 
 lunges, Ragotzy, suddenly, made a desperate home-

 thrust at Iwan, and, yielding rather to his passion, than 
 taking counsel from his judgment, instead of retiring, 
 on its being parried, he closed upon the richter, whose 
 spear impierced his coat of mail — 
 
 "The griding sword, with discontinuous wound, 
 Passed through him."* 
 
 Count Ragotzy sunk upon the plain, and the life-blood, 
 which gushed from between the joints of his armour, 
 was not this time that of a foeman. The Richter Iwan, 
 toil-spent with the contest, approached, and leaned on 
 his spear over the prostrate leader, whose mortal life, 
 apparently, had gone forth in that gushing tide. Some 
 near, unclasped the rivets of his gorget, and threw open 
 his vizor. The fresh air, blowing upon his stony coun- 
 tenance, recovered him to a transitory consciousness. His 
 dark eye rested on the crimsoned luminary, then just in 
 the final act of dipping into the black, thick, volume ol 
 congregated vapour, that rolled along the level west, 
 like the visible exhalation of some volcanic abyss. What 
 dread auguries lie often, half-disclosed, in the changeful 
 colour, shape, and motion of the meteors of the air ; the 
 fleeting combinations of that magnificent system of ma- 
 terial signs, which we inhabit ! typifying, with most mi- 
 raculous organ, the lot of humanity. 
 
 Count Ragotzy might, perhaps, have read, in the 
 skiey influences of that hour, at once an omen and a 
 type of his own destiny. Wherever dwelt his thoughts, 
 whither, on the untrod futurity, his adventurous soul was 
 about to explore, or, trammelled by the clinging interests 
 of time, they found refuge, like the son of Osiris, on some 
 bright floating isle f in the deep sea of remembrance, some

 ere the waves of sin and sorrow broke over, and engulfed 
 it ; some insular period of puerile innocence, that, if not 
 sanctified by holy writ, had been, at least, illumined by 
 the sublimities of classic lore ; wherever were his thoughts, 
 whether they shot back to those days of comparative 
 guiltlessness, and whether regret made any part of his 
 fleeting reverie, He alone, who reads the heart of man, 
 in its most unfathomable depths and stillest sanctuaries, 
 can tell. The minute, perhaps, mercifully vouchsafed " in 
 signum et in portentum,"f expired, and the dim eye 
 of the Cygani turned from the sun's ominous setting, and 
 lit on the face of the richter, who, with his vizor up, 
 was bending over him ; but the past and future were 
 alike absorbed in the thoughts of the present, and his 
 few remaining sands of life were shaken to their last 
 scruple, as Count Ragotzy glared on the features of his 
 antagonist, in whom he had now no difficulty of know- 
 ing his fated conqueror, Sigismund. 
 
 " Ha !" he cried, in faint accents, " it burst upon me, 
 my mother's prophecy ! I never believed in her before ; —

 death. " You overheard, — you ! The regalia ! — ha !

 " Oh, 'tis excellent ! And thou, also, lovest and 
 wouldst wed her, you rescued from me erewhiles, — Ve- 
 ronica of Eissenburg ? — hey ? is't not so ?" As he thus 
 spoke, an indescribable emotion played upon the coun- 
 tenance of the expiring brigand. 
 
 " Where," again demanded Sigismund, — " where have 
 you hidden the diadem of St. Stephen ? — speak ! for 
 God's sake, ere too late !" 
 
 " Oh, mother, — Unna !" resumed Ragotzy, without 
 heeding the inquiry, " what a prophetess art thou ! and 
 I never to believe in thee till now ! — 'tis long since thou 
 foretoldst, that I should fall by the hand of the man, 
 whom, ere he was conscious of his property in them, I 
 had forestalled of his two dearest rights. I never recked 
 thy augury before, but now I call it to mind ; — 'twas 
 perfect ! excellent !" 
 
 " The regalia ?" cried Sigismund. 
 
 " True, the regalia !" repeated Ragotzy, contending, 
 in broken syllables, with the ensanguined tide, that 
 choked his utterance ; — " Tis thine by right, I trow ; 
 and — and — well, if that is not, after all, a sweet le- 
 gacy of vengeance !" 
 
 His head sank; his nether-jaw dropped; he strove 
 again to look up, — in vain ; but still a bright, mysterious 
 smile of fiendish exultation, flashed athwart his face, as 
 the fierce and turbid spirit of the wicked Cygani sought 
 the sphere of its nativity, . . where 7 . Like Beaufort, "he died 
 and made no sign." * But let us repeat the aspiration of

 " Alas ! my best hope of effecting this discovery dies 
 with thee !" murmured Sigismund, with unutterable bit- 
 terness of feeling ; " but let me tear my selfish regret 
 from my heart, nor suffer it to absorb the remembrance 
 of an imperative duty." He knelt down, and, removing 
 the tartan from the helm of the lifeless Cygani, bathed 
 it in his oozing wound ; and then, uplifting the ensan- 
 guined shred to Heaven, he exclaimed, with melancholy 
 fervour, " Sainted spirit of the murdered Rodna ! 1 
 breathed on thy slaughtered manes, the incense of a 
 solemn service ; — my oath is now redeemed. In the 
 blood of thine assassin I have dyed this last relic, that 
 reminded me of thy kindness and thy fate. Rest in 
 peace, gentle spirit ! and look down in pity on the or- 
 phan, whom thy example first taught to love virtue !" 
 Sigismund bowed his head, and wept in silence. 
 
 Meanwhile, the fortune of the day was decided. The 
 fall of their leader put an end to the stand of the insur- 
 gent Hungarians ; and such of the imperialists as had 
 hitherto offered a desultory resistance, surrendered at 
 discretion. The vicissitudes of the battle were over ; 
 the fight was won, and, soon after, the pall of darkness 
 fell upon the scene.

 tossed to and fro, on those unreal depths, where the soul

 seems to anchor, but all without a bottom. Those cares, 
 passions, and interests, with which the mind is commonly 
 agitated, seldom fail to get dashed together in the kaleido- 
 scope of dreams, where are jumbled seriousness with im- 
 pertinence, and mirth with gravity. Reason abdicates 
 the throne of the soul. The imagination will shed the 
 mockery of her promethean hues, over the incorporeal 
 shadows of our waking thoughts, investing the chaotic 
 transcript, with a fantastic semblance of reality.* Cer- 
 tain trains of thought, similar in character to what had 
 busied Swartz's meditations for the last two days, natu- 
 rally resumed, or rather prolonged, their influence over 
 the faculties of his soul, during this her state of abstrac- 
 tion. His uncurbed spirit, disentangled in her opera- 
 tions, travelled back the course of time, retracing at a 
 wish, each interval, and leaping every barrier, without 
 even the consciousness of an impediment. By the magic 
 felicity of dreams, the past lived anew in the present. 
 He again was of the household of Countess Sccepas ; again 
 became the equerry of the young waivode, her son ; again 
 languished in secret, and felt himself the very slave of the 
 too gentle Beatrice. He would stroll into the woods to 
 tell his audacious love to the stars, as he was wont to do ; 
 he would return for very restlessness in being absent from 
 the princess, to cast at awful distance, furtive glances on 
 the object, of his homage, or experience the delicious 
 tremblings, into which her presence invariably threw him. 
 And that remembrance, which made the demon of his 
 life, visited his visions. He dreamed, they were sailing 
 for pleasure on the lake, — himself, and his sweet sister 
 Alicia, John of Zapola, and his sister, and the eleve of 
 the countess, that meditative boy, George Martinuzzi. 
 All sat in the light skiff or seel trinker, with counte- 
 nances, redeemed from the rottenness of death, or trans- 
 formed from the wanness of carking cares, to the light of

 spring and life, . . to all the genial comeliness, proper to the 
 May of existence. Suddenly the face of the heavens 
 changed— a terrible squall came on, and the little vessel 
 struck against a rock,— the young waivode swam to shore 
 with his sister, the princess, and made good his landing. 
 Martinuzzi, meanwhile, stemmed the fierce torrent, sus- 
 taining Alicia on his arm. The feeble equerry alone 
 clung to the sinking raft; the waters rushed in with irre- 
 sistible rapidity ; and soon, upon the raging billows, he 
 breathed a life, to which each second threatened a limit — 
 heavily they rolled over him, the whirling waves, as he 
 sank ; then came the gurgle, the choaking, and the last 
 convulsive grasp of the pent breath, that strove with the 
 storm for utterance, — the cry reached the ears of Marti- 
 nuzzi, who, consigning Alicia to the arms of her attend- 
 ants, plunged, fearlessly, back into the lake, and again 
 buffetted the tempestuous waves. Just as the brawling 
 surge spake instant death, " the strong swimmer" dived 
 beneath the foaming surface of the water, and having 
 gripped the equerry by his clothes, soon rose again, bear- 
 ing him, helpless and unconscious, to the shore. 
 
 This vision of the past rose to Swartz's sleeping facul- 
 ties, with a depth and graduating of apprehension, truly 
 terrific. Then, in regular order of time, he and the too 
 amiable Alicia, poured forth, before their meek and noble- 
 minded preserver, their warm acknowledgments for the 
 debt of existence. Oh ! how vivid, was the sleeping- 
 man's recollection of that scene! The mute demonstra- 
 tions of thankfulness on the part of his susceptible sister, 
 — his own louder protestations of undying gratitude, and 
 Martinuzzi, looking on the while, with his radiant coun- 
 tenance, beaming his usual sweet, but somewhat pensive, 
 smile, which, the emanation of his own kind heart, fell 
 softly, like sunshine from the level west, on the hearts of 
 all about him. Yes, there was the self-same being, who, 
 disclaiming all merit, breathed his gentle accents of self- 
 depreciation, in their ears, whom he had lately rescued

 from a watery grave. There shone the same open phy- 
 siognomy, where all spake unhesitating " trustingness," 
 and clear uncalculating faith. Not a shadow of distrust 
 was there. Pure in his own integrity, he was incapable 
 of entertaining any suspicion, against others. When the 
 equerry loudly proclaimed, that he consecrated the energies 
 of all to come of existence, in aid of the man, who 
 had saved his life, the mild blue eyes of Martinuzzi, looked 
 forth his acceptance of his services, without a particle of 
 misdoubting. Presently, his features grew indistinct; 
 their outline dim, they melted away ; and, like the fresh 
 reflection of a magic lantern, the shadow changed to the 
 Tour Rouge ; and eventful years must have intervened, for 
 the romantic and pious boy, was become the brightest 
 of the conclave, and metamorphosed into that warrior 
 and statesman, whom crowned heads were emulous to 
 enlist in the number of their friends. Aoain his noble 
 form uprose in the phantasmagoria of the night, and he 
 gazed upon Swartz, long and steadfastly, but not as 
 before, with eyes of benignity and good will, but in the 
 sternness of indignant wrath. 
 
 " Double-dyed villain!" cried the lord regent, whom 
 the dreamer imagined to be uplifting over him, a naked 
 scymetar; "ungrateful, false, and treacherous ! Is this 
 your return for all my benefits? Did you suffer me for 
 years to delude myself, that Sigismund's personal free- 
 dom was restricted to the defile of Rothenthorn,* when, 
 whatsoever times he was not in Hermanstadt, he was 
 compelling the voice of fame to trumpet his renown, — 
 as a captain, and an able one? Was not the subterfuge 
 of madness, a conspiracy between ye ? And hast thou 
 not, in base requital of all the favours I have showered

 sire? — Thou hast! thy professions in the chateau of the

 thee, thy perjury;" and Martinuzzi seemed to the 
 dreamer, to raise his arm to strike him to the earth. 
 
 Swartz, in vain endeavoured to voice his contrition and 
 excuse. 
 
 " Die, thankless traitor !" cried the regent ! " for thou 
 canst offer not a word in palliation." 
 
 " Indeed — I — I can, — A licia V screamed Swartz, stretch- 
 ing out his arm. Struggling in his agony of pleading to 
 express himself more fully, the effort burst the charm of 
 sleep ; and the conscience-visited slumberer started from 
 his shivering dream. Half raising himself, he looked 
 round the cavern, and his senses were almost immediately 
 assailed by circumstances, not less appalling, than the 
 visions from which he had just freed himself, — but there 
 was no second escape, — no re-awaking; and he might not 
 shun that visitation, which presently unnerved his frame. 
 The ground on which he reclined, palpably heaved be- 
 neath him, like the billows of the deep; low and mina- 
 tory reverberations, like thunder, rumbled within the 
 entrails of the earth.

 Every object around seemed in motion, while a sort of 
 blue and supernatural light quivered fitfully, and wild ; 
 animating with fantastic glare, the grunstein, or species 
 of basaltic rock, of which the walls and roof of the dun- 
 geon were composed. It was not difficult for Swartz to 
 divine, that the district must be visited, by one of those 
 earthquakes, so frequent in Hungary, during the century, 
 to which our tale refers ; he started to his feet, and the 
 apprehension of perishing in his remote prison, suddenly 
 welled to his throat, like a molten tide oF agony. In that, 
 age and country, personal courage was deemed indispen- 
 sable, and men were so continually under the necessity 
 of attesting " the mettle of their pasture," that not, as in 
 an elder day, could valour arrogate a common appella- 
 tive with virtue. It was too universal an attribute, pro-

 perly to merit so honourable a distinction. The case was 
 different with the ancients, who, whether of Greece or 
 Rome, as Cicero admits,* were only relatively courageous. 
 Their barbarous enemies were vanquished, and oppressed, 
 by their own fears ; we recommend the reader who may 
 be inclined to dissent from our opinion, to turn to 
 Herodotus' account of the irresolution of the Lacedse- 
 monians (certainly not the least warlike of the Greeks), 
 for days previous to the battle of Platsea. 
 
 Truth to say, these lauded heroes of the old age, could 
 achieve great things, on the spur of the moment, but 
 they were deficient in that invariable principle of endur- 
 ance, which characterises the modern soldier, and which 
 the Romans must have esteemed of high desert, when 
 they distinguished it by the name of virtus. We have 
 our doubts, whether the conqueror of Pharsalia would 
 have liked to contest the palm, with either the victors or 
 the vanquished, who fought at Waterloo. To return. — 
 Among the very few exceptions to be met with of the 
 bravery of the age, we might instance, the wretched in- 
 mate in the cave of the Cyganis, — weak and sickly from 
 his youth upwards, Swartz was distinguished by a cer- 
 tain constitutional timidity of character. 
 
 " A puny insect trembling at a breeze." 
 
 The peril in which he now stood, shot cold thrills, 
 through his feeble frame; his blood receded to his heart, 
 and large and agonizing dews forced their way to his 
 forehead. Perhaps, after all, the best recipe a man can 
 be provided with, if he would meet death with equanimity, 
 when thus, at unawares, his soul is caught hovering in the 
 last moments of its separation, is the soothing consider- 
 ation of his having used the opportunities of life, with 
 temperance and moderation —

 Their virtues to wait on them, bravely mock

 Even the sect of old, who deemed 
 
 " This barren world sufficient bliss — "t 
 
 that of Epicurus, however wedded in joyless union to 
 our present mouldering and dunghill state of being, was 
 yet deeply impressed with the policy of such a prepara- 
 tion for — the gulf of eternal dissolution. How much 
 more reason then have we, of this generation, to enter- 
 tain a like opinion, who know, that in our flesh we shall 
 see God : — from whose vision the film is removed; who 
 can pierce, through the shadows and darkness, that hang 
 over the tomb, and compass, beyond a doubt, that im- 
 mortality, which the wisest Pagan only dimly apprehended 
 in his most sanguine dream ; who, " by the demonstra- 
 tions of Newton, can overturn the absurd doctrine of 
 blind chance, "J or fortuitous concourse of atoms, and 
 can recognise, in the heathen's mechanical necessity,., 
 the first cause of his cheerless creed, — that greater Deity, 
 who, in revealing Himself unto us, has promised, that 
 the mortifying our appetites in the flesh will be rewarded, 
 with an eternal inheritance of bliss, in the life to come. 
 
 Well might the Bishop of Clermont affirm, " La re- 
 ligion rassure Tame et on craint bien moins la mort, 
 quand on esttranquille sur les suites." § Swartz was not 
 pre-armed, with this best orvietan against the apprehen- 
 sion of death : " Contra mortis timorem et contra metum 
 religionis."* Resolving, however, not to lose existence 
 without a struggle, he instinctively rushed to the low, and 
 narrow entrance of the rocky cave. Loudly, but to no 
 purpose, did he implore some one to throw open the 
 door of his prison, and afford him a chance for life.

 Alas! even to his own ears, his cries seemed drowned, 
 in the convulsion of the elements. Soon his eyes dar- 
 kened, and ears tingled, with the enervating sensation 
 of unresisted terror; — when a dreadful crash, which 
 sounded like the bursting of the mountain, shattered the 
 dungeon portal to fragments, and hurled its inmate some 
 paces forward. Slowly, Swartz revived ; but ere he 
 wholly recovered his consciousness, he felt an impulse, 
 to explore his way to the upper air, that was irresistible. 
 He was acting upon it accordingly, when, suddenly, a 
 sulphureous gleam wavered, and played about him ; — 
 he recoiled several steps, for, just then, a wild, fierce cry, 
 was heard above his head, and, as well as the film of 
 fear, and the flickering light, permitted him to discern, 
 he beheld, upon the ledge of a rock a short way off, a 
 tall, gaunt figure, whose visage, preternaturally excited, 
 glared horribly ; and whose right hand held a large case- 
 knife. The obscure appearance leaped a wide fissure, 
 and lighted within arm's length of where Swartz leaned, 
 in the very infatuation of terror, against the door-way : — 
 and now it points the bare weapon at his heart — it 
 speaks — it is no illusion. The figure was that of Unnai 
 who prepared to stretch the speechless prisoner, a corpse 
 upon the earth. 
 
 " False, cozening dastard !" she exclaimed, " whose 
 treachery hath undone us, — who introduced the detested 
 Sigismund, to the cavern of Coloswar ! the dwellings of 
 Mount Hielen will, shortly, dissolve away, and be 
 crumbled, like a scroll, in dust, and sparks, and sul- 
 phur ; — yet think not so, any more than shall Pereny — 
 with whom thou wert leagued — that skulking Ethiop of 
 Hermanstadt, to escape my vengeance. But for thee, 
 since thou art chiefest villain, so shalt thou die the first. 
 Down to thy native hell !" 
 
 Saying these words, Unna advanced one foot for- 
 ward, and the blade gleamed already at the throat of her 
 victim, whose heart sickened, and brain turned dizzy,

 as he stood paralyzed, in the apprehension of instant 
 death ; and the next movement of the gipsy would have 
 sealed his fate for ever, in this world, when, on a sudden, 
 the earth again trembled beneath their feet, and ere the 
 sharp and accelerated steel touched the shrinking flesh, 
 the mass of rock, already riven, tottering, and loosened 
 from its foundations, heaved its fragments into the air, 
 with a convulsive force, that resounded like the pealing 
 of many thunders. In burst, through a number of 
 chasms, the foaming and overflowing billows of the neigh- 
 bouring river. The crags and ridges of the disparted 
 roof, were intermixed with the blood-streaked skies ; and 
 there was heard the deepening rush of waters, which 
 became tinted with the glare of hell, from the flaming 
 atmosphere above. The elements of earth, fire, and 
 water, lay confusedly mingled together ; " Chaos is come 
 again!" The murderess, and her destined victim, 
 were separated, in the concussion, by a distance of seve- 
 ral yards ; — each was thrown on the opposite edge of a 
 vast abyss, whose darkness and depth, the eye might 
 vainly seek to measure. The breath, and recollection of 
 both failed them simultaneously. 
 
 For some days, the history of Swartz presents a 
 blank ; and afterwards, during his narcosis, either the 
 torrent, or another convulsion of the earth, had borne 
 him far from Mount Hielen. He was discovered by 
 some Slowark peasantry, near the Marosh, lying on his 
 face, — his eyes fixed, — his lips wide apart, — and, toge- 
 ther with his tongue, parched and arid. But although 
 apparently in the act of expiring, life was not yet ex- 
 tinct ; so they conveyed him, in company with other 
 sufferers, mostly Cyganis, from the scene of the earth- 
 quake. 
 
 It was on opening his eyelids, after a deep sleep, that 
 Swartz first surveyed the objects around him, with ap- 
 prehensive observation. His consciousness slowly re- 
 turned, combined with a sense of great exhaustion ; and

 he ascertained, from cettain symptoms in his difficult 
 respiration, that his reviviscence would indeed be tran- 
 sient. The darkened lamp of existence, seemed sud- 
 denly brightened up, as if on purpose to receive a more 
 sacred dismissal; during- which holy viaticum, in the 
 course of the day, the extinguisher of death descended 
 to quench the last vital spark, that flickered within. 
 
 "Art thou, in truth, Walter?" inquired the dying 
 man, in faltering accents, raising his heavy eyes to the 
 person of his attendant: " Where am I ? — how came I 
 here ? — is your lord, — is Count Rodna, within call?" 
 
 From the other's reply, Swartz learned much, that sur- 
 prised, and not a little, that interested him. It appeared 
 that Sigismund had fallen in with the sad procession of 
 carts, and other lumbering vehicles ; and his eye hap- 
 pening to distinguish, among the number of sufferers, the 
 person of his pseudo-keeper, he had directed Walter to 
 return to Coloswar with the wretched martyr, and render 
 him every possible assistance. From this person's ac- 
 count of the late battle, Swartz perceived how greatly 
 the victory was attributable to the opportune arrival on 
 the field, of the richter, who, it seemed, had caused his 
 force to evacuate the neighbourhood, the day after the 
 battle. Swartz was informed, moreover, that the dowager 
 Isabella, and the young queen, had repaired to Coloswar, 
 confessedly with the view of the latter solemnly trans- 
 ferring to the lord regent, before the diet, her crown, with 
 all the rights thereunto appertaining ; but that ceremony 
 had been necessarily deferred, for, to the extreme con- 
 sternation of every soul, the room, where the regalia was 
 used to be deposited, had been despoiled of its treasure. 
 It was discovered empty of all things whatsoever, save 
 what was least expected to be found in such a place, 
 namely a gory, mouldering, human skeleton, which lay 
 stretched upon the floor.

 try, at the disappearance of the diadem of St. Stephen,

 under circumstances, so big with mystery and horror, was 
 single and unexampled. The queen and Czerina had 
 thereupon taken their departure, and Martinuzzi, a few 
 hours afterwards, quitted Coloswar for the capital. The 
 chief nobility, and the army, had followed, bearing along 
 with them the Marquis of Piadena, and other Austrian 
 prisoners of distinction. Of all the Hungarian magnats, 
 who lately thronged that city, for the purpose of attend- 
 ing the parliament of Transylvania,* the constable 
 Vicchy, whose attainder had been reversed, and who 
 had been appointed one of the castellans, alone re- 
 mained. 
 
 Swartz, who had preserved deep silence throughout 
 the above communication, here hastily broke in, " How 
 say you ? — is Vicchy now in the fortress ?" 
 
 "In the fortress? — in the house," replied Walter. 
 " He was dangerously wounded by the Cygani leader, 
 but is at present, thanks to the careful attendance of the 
 Lady Veronica, nearly convalescent." 
 
 " Prithee, Walter," cried Swartz, rising on his couch, 
 and with considerable eagerness of manner, " bear the 
 message of a dying man to Vicchy. Tell him, I have an 
 important matter to reveal, which concerns his own 
 daughter's interests ; — bid him hie hither to receive back 
 the letter of Alicia." 
 
 Walter left the room, and, shortly after, the Duke of 
 Eissenburg opened the door. He hesitated, and Swartz 
 beckoned him to approach. There was mutual silence 
 for an instant, and the dying man seemed collecting his 
 ideas, with the purpose of addressing Vicchy, when the 
 latter spoke. 
 
 " Agent of Iwan," he said, " let me spare you, in 
 your present state, making a superfluous communication. 
 I already know all you would tell me, having had an 
 interview with the true heir, whose rightful claims I am

 ready to admit, and, if needs be, to maintain with my 
 sword. I have, I fear me, lived in a dream for many 
 years, — but that Boszorkany fooled me. Alas ! my 
 beloved daughter is never fated to wear a crown." 
 
 u Stop there !" cried Swartz ; " the devil, for such 
 she surely is, perchance spake truth therein. In one 
 sense,* the Lady Veronica will, by your leave, yet reign 
 in Hungary." 
 
 " I understand you ; but learn, that he, who alone can 
 accomplish thus much, hath offered my child to share 
 with him his throne, and " 
 
 The couch of Swartz faced the west, and the rays of 
 the evening sun streamed through the casement, on the 
 upward countenance of the dying man. The softening 
 light shed on it a peculiar animation, as, interrupting 
 Vicchy, he exclaimed, though with feeble articulation, 
 " And been rejected? — Sigismund rejected? — oh no, 
 impossible !" 
 
 " Not rejected," replied Vicchy ; " although the beams 
 he throws upon my daughter shine coldly, as in water, it 
 seems there is some insuperable obstacle." 
 
 "• Ha ! my prophetic brain ! I divined as much," 
 murmured Swartz, starting up on his couch, — " that 
 man would scruple no extremities which — umph ! Say," 
 he cried, turning to Vicchy, while an expression of wild 
 inquiry irradiated his ghastly visage, " has it not rela- 
 tion to Alaric Polgar ?" 
 
 " Alaric Polgar !" repeated Vicchy, with an involun- 
 tary shudder, — " what relation can aught belonging to 
 that man, bear to Veronica Eissenburg ? No, sir, my 
 daughter avows her predilection, for him, who rescued her 
 from the Cygani's thraldom ; but, nevertheless, affirms

 that an insuperable obstacle has arisen to her enter- 
 taining his suit." 
 
 " Has the young lady never let drop any intimation 
 of the nature of this barrier ?" inquired Swartz. 
 
 " None, save what is wrapt in hideous, inexplicable 
 hints," replied Vicchy. 
 
 Swartz threw himself back on his pillow, and, half 
 burying his face in the bed-clothes, ruminated for several 
 minutes in silence. When again he addressed himself to 
 Vicchy ; his countenance had anticipated the cadaverous 
 hue of death. " I feel the source of life rapidly reced- 
 ing at my heart," he said ; " Time and I must shortly 
 shake hands for ever ; but, of all sublunary concerns, 
 the prospects of that boy lie nearest my heart, — why it 
 should be, I know not, unless my having saved his life in 
 babyhood;, though done in the spirit of hatred and re- 
 venge to another, makes him dear to me ; 'tis human 
 to love what we have long cherished. He, my dead sister, 
 and one other, were the sole things in all this world I ever 
 cared for, and he now catches and entangles the feeble 
 wings of the soul, which vainly essay their freedom. 
 Duke of Eissenburg, the happiness of the noble Sigis- 
 mund rests with the Lady Veronica — his happiness ; and 
 will that lady, who surely cannot but return his love, 
 consign, both him and herself to unavailing and livelong 
 sorrow, on account of some sick dream — some formless 
 phantasy ? I've heard you laud the strong masculine 
 sense of your daughter ; she, like Iwan, is of that new 
 faith, which none can adopt, without having, even by 
 their very apostasy, attested the vigour of their under- 
 standing. For Sigismund's sake — for your daughter's, 
 I must speak to her, and make the appeal of a man, who, 
 on the verge of the grave, views the phantasmas of this 
 world, not according to the factitious lights of mortality; 
 but, in the transparency of a holier medium. I think I 
 can show her, that that expressionless objection, which 
 hardly apprehends itself, ought not to interpose, between

 the man she loves and happiness. Let the case be, that 
 this fiction bear the countenance of self-reproach, — ay, 
 guilt, proper to herself. Start not, my lord, nor knit thy 
 brows.- — What then ? — I say not, the guilt is cardinal 
 and substantive; but, perchance, the hollow mockery, 
 of the term, some mere chimera, as 1 vaguely surmise, 
 born of the silliest prejudice. Shall such depose so sensi- 
 ble a young lady from the exercise of her own faculties ? 
 Surely not. Shall mere opinion, respecting which, the 
 decision of her own judgment, and the dictate of her 
 conscience show the fallacy, acquire sufficient weight 
 over her conduct, to blast her hopes and stain that 
 honour, which, though it hath no armour of proof against 
 sin, she truly knows, white as the heart of truth ? Why 
 should she, by her misdoubting, infer her secret frailty, 
 or be sensible of the sting of a reproach, who is a stranger 
 to the guilt that is implied in it ? Wherefore, needlessly, 
 lay herself open, to the cavils and the penalties of a mis- 
 judging world ? Can sin be imputed where neither fore- 
 sight nor volition enters 1 — where there is no consent of 
 the mind ? — nay, more, where it may be presumed, that 
 consciousness itself was absent,* ' no person can be truly 
 dishonoured by the act of another,'! — and as for involun- 
 tary soilure, there is no such thing." 
 
 "Soilure! sayst thou ? — Madness! hell!" exclaimed 
 Vicchy. " Why couple such a sound with the idea of 
 Veronica ?" 
 
 " Well, my lord, your daughter best knows her own 
 immaculateness, or, at the worst, whatever of complicity 
 with evil, abhorrent to her better nature, may sully her 
 secret retrospects, must be laid to the account of fate, 
 and not of crime ;\ however, as respects the future, her

 course is free, and if, from an inexplicable circumstance, 
 which I faintly guess at, viewed, probably, through some 
 rare and ideal medium, she raise a nice question of ca- 
 suistry, and deem that propriety exacts of her the sacri- 
 fice of Sigismund and herself, the folly, not to say the 
 guilt, will be entirely her own, — but I hope better things. 
 May I confer with her ?" 
 
 " Thou hast strangely shook me, sir, and I dare not 
 guess what thy words point at," replied Vicchy ; " but I 
 will fetch my daughter, and, the Virgin grant! on every 
 account, that thy arguments prevail with her to wed this 
 royal youth." 
 
 " Before you go," said Swartz, observing that Vicchy 
 was about to leave the chamber, " one other word, — here 
 I deposit back, in your hands, the confession of Alicia. 
 Since, you have spoken with Iwan, you must be aware, 
 that there remains one living witness, whose testimony, 
 were it forthcoming, would evidence, beyond a doubt, 
 the validity of his claims." 
 
 " You must mean Peter Pereny," said Vicchy. 
 
 " Right," replied Swartz ; " since I last saw the noble 
 Sigismund, I have incidentally discovered, that the dis- 
 guised attendant of Father Dominick, is no other than 
 the once haughty Waivode of Transylvania." 
 
 "Ha! Scipio, the black?" 
 
 "And Peter Pereny, are the same, my lord. Go to 
 Iwan and say as much, and when you mention who told 
 you, bear to him my final prayers, and bid him spare one 
 thought from glorious empire, to the memory of the man, 
 who first recommended him to pretend madness, as the 
 sole means of saving him from the fate of the venerable 
 Rodna ; — 'tis all I ask, and his heart, kind as it is noble, 
 will not decline the tribute. Now, you may fetch your 
 daughter, my lord." 
 
 Vicchy quitted the room, and soon returned, accompa- 
 nied by Veronica, but whilst he was away, Swartz had 
 undergone an alteration for the worse ; life was now

 ebbing rapidly ; he lifted up his face as they entered, and 
 signed with his hand, for the anxious father and his at- 
 tendant, Walter, to retire. Veronica waited until they 
 had withdrawn, and then placed herself, pale and trem- 
 bling by the dying man's bed-side. Swartz, taking her 
 hand in his, and leaning his wan transparent face to- 
 wards her, spoke a few low words in the ear of the agi- 
 tated girl, whose clear complexion, as she sunk upon a 
 chair, became charged, or rather overcharged, to the very 
 roots of her hair, with a rich red tint. " On that night 
 — so — as I feared," said Swartz. Veronica covered her 
 face within her robe, and her delicate form seemed to 
 shrink within itself. 
 
 It is not our intention ever to enter upon the particulars 
 of this private and solemn colloquy, though thereby we 
 might assuredly illustrate a curious chapter of the human 
 heart: for fear, however, of any misapprehension we for- 
 bear. It is sufficient, perhaps here to inform the reader, 
 that the dying accents of Swartz, instilled themselves, 
 gently, like the wholesome dews of Heaven, upon the heart 
 of our protestant heroine, who, at length, consented to 
 forego that feminine, but unimaginable scruple, which 
 her sensitive delicacy had conjured up, like some ghost 
 shrouded in its own formless horror. In fine, she pro- 
 mised to bestow "her hand with her heart in it,"* on our 
 hero. Tis ten to one, under the same temptation, — my 
 simpering dear ! — but you had acted similarly. 
 
 Turn we from the death-bed of Swartz, to the gorge 
 of the Bargartolke, on the frontier of the principality, 
 where the curious gaze of any chance wayfarers was 
 attracted, by the unusual appearance of a close chariot, 
 winding its slow way along the mountain pass ; now, as it 
 descended the precipitous cliff, presenting a strong out- 
 line against the lurid sky, and presently, toiling up the 
 deep and opposite chasm below them. These gazed, 
 indeed, but if not their cupidity, at least all their hopes

 of obtaining booty, must have been at once dispelled, on 
 descrying the formidable appearance of the escort. It 
 consisted of some score or two of horsemen, whose 
 snowy plumes and gilded spurs bespake their honourable 
 rank, while the ever-ready carbine, slung at their saddle- 
 bows, gave note and warning to the banded dolbatchs, 
 or the solitary kanactz, of the travellers' preparation 
 against attack. Half of these, with lances in rest, and 
 pennons displayed, preceded the chariot, as an advanced 
 guard ; the remainder brought up the rear. With diffi- 
 culty, but obviously with as much speed as the nature of 
 the ground permitted, the cavalcade we are describing 
 passed through the cragged defile, and entered upon the 
 scarce-trod regions beyond. The roads, before rugged 
 and broken up, here became almost impracticable. The 
 land was left untilled — the instruments of husbandry 
 were destroyed, or abandoned, and even such few plots 
 of cultivation, scattered amidst this frightful waste, as 
 were not converted into almost impenetrable thickets, 
 were fertilized, or rather made rank, with human manure. 
 On all sides, such was the richness of the soil, the height 
 of the grass was sufficient to conceal deserted cottages 
 from sight;* war and rapine had suspended the labours 
 of man's industry, and no erections of his ingenuity, or 
 trace of his existence, met the eye. The mills had been 
 thrown down, the very rivers were choked up, the sites of 
 thriving villages, now solely indicated by charred heaps 
 of ruins, were passed at intervals, so that for miles, on 
 all sides, what should have been a smiling scene of health 
 and plenty, possessed the character of some vast and 
 deserted charnel-house. 
 
 Such were the evils, that interminable and senseless 
 contests inflicted on this part of Transylvania, and which

 those now traversing that desolate region seemed resolved 
 to perpetuate ; for reader, the chariot contains no less 
 personages, than the Lady Czerina and her haughty mo- 
 ther, who, instead of being on the road to Hermanstadt, 
 as was given out, were putting into execution a suddenly- 
 concerted scheme of Isabella, to repair to the court of 
 Sigismund Augustus, king of Poland. She meant to 
 throw herself at that monarch's feet, and implore of him 
 the succour of an army, to aid the patriot magnats of 
 Hungary, in hurling from his unjust elevation, the mitred 
 usurper of her daughter's dignities. And though she 
 knew her brother's attention was fully occupied at home, 
 and that his whole mind was bent on arbitrating the 
 theological differences of his people, to the exclusion of 
 every thing else, less immediately pressing, still Isabella 
 doubted not, but that her eloquence would move him, 
 and, what was a matter requiring more management, 
 would prevail upon his phlegmatic lieges, to espouse her 
 quarrel. There might be yet a further motive for her 
 flying the kingdom, which, being private to the bosom of 
 Isabella, obtained, from that very circumstance, a greater 
 influence over her conduct. It was probable, she experi- 
 enced a bitter satisfaction, in having to throw the barrier 
 of distance, between Antoine Ferraro and her daughter. 
 She purposed not, that the separation should be for any 
 time, because the dread vengeance, whose horrors as yet 
 floated dimly on her mental horizon, she well knew must 
 exceed any pangs, incident to mere temporary and bodily 
 disunion ; besides, that a prolonged absence would be 
 incompatible with her plans. 
 
 Still the evident disquietude of Czerina, and the tor- 
 menting reflections to which, she trusted, Ferraro would be 
 subjected, became to the queen mother a source of ma- 
 lignant, though exquisite gratification. 
 
 For two days, the royal dames and their knightly escort 
 had pursued their adventurous journey, avoiding all 
 populous parts of the country, and choosing such solitary

 and ruinous districts, as we have described above, when, 
 at the point of time, we again solicit the reader's kind 
 attention, the sun's disk became obscured, and magnified 
 in cloud and vapour. A thick mist overspread the face 
 of the earth ; and now a wilder, and more desolate pros- 
 pect opened before our travellers ; for, on emerging from 
 the ravine, they entered the long and mountainous tract 
 of the Eckelebanya, whose horizon, the lowering clouds 
 presently covered with one uniform tint. A tremendous 
 storm visited the country ; the thunder reverberated along 
 the distant hills, and the vast sheets of blinding lightning 
 struck man and horse with like affright. Many of the 
 latter began to plunge and rear, to the imminent danger 
 of their riders. After having, for above an hour, breasted 
 the elemental strife, the party arrived before a vast chasm, 
 or rent of the mountain, which, from the apparent con- 
 tiguity of the opposite crags, would seem to have been 
 the operation of some earthquake. Here, the fierce gusts 
 of wind drifted like a hurricane along the rocky ledge, 
 that formed their path, and several of the escort were 
 suddenly unhorsed, as if struck by magic. Isabella or- 
 dered the cavalcade to halt, and straightwise, within the 
 rifted mountain, find place of refuge, from the pitiless 
 pelting of the tempest. In obedience to these com- 
 mands, the royal chariot was drawn under a huge arch 
 of the projecting cleft, while most of the escort, dis- 
 mounting, led their frighted steeds deep within the same

 There is an incident recorded of Isabella, on this occa- 
 sion, which, long preserved by popular tradition, we are 
 unwilling to pass over in silence, since history, whilst 
 relieving her details by the affecting episode, appears 
 to have dropped her usual calm and inflexible tone, 
 appealing to the human heart, in such deep and melan- 
 choly accents, as are more proper to the sister muse. 
 
 The queen-mother — so runs the relation — drew back the 
 curtain of her chariot, while the fury of the elements v as

 at its height, and, to the astonishment of her devoted 
 escort, alighted. Her profuse tresses were enveloped, 
 in the folds of her robe of cashmere, which made her 
 customary travelling suit, and which became, at present, 
 her only protection from the deluging storm. Putting 
 a firm negative, on the general request to wait upon her 
 steps, the royal lady, suddenly turning an angle of the 
 jutting rock, struck into a defile between two lofty pre- 
 cipices, and was instantly out of sight. 
 
 Czerina remained in the chariot, lost in reverie ; her 
 mind, of late, appeared to sink under the peculiarities of 
 her situation, and her health had become visibly impaired. 
 
 Alone, and on foot, Isabella traversed a black and 
 savage wilderness, the horrors of which, the state of the 
 weather, and the fading light, fearfully augmented. She 
 trod the dizzy path, along the edge of the precipice, with 
 reckless haste, but with a step as sure as that of the wild 
 goat. The rain descended in torrents, but she marked 
 it not. The thunder rolled with awful intensity, inter- 
 rupted, so to speak, from time to time, with the howling 
 of the wolves at a distance ; but her ears were deafer 
 than the adder's, and the heavy atmosphere of the hills, 
 vainly discharged living fire about her person, as she 
 wandered, like a restless spirit, through their loaded 
 mazes. The livid glare, which made her, instinctively, 
 close the organs of sight, failed to extort her conscious- 
 ness, or withdraw her from that tempest of the soul, 
 which added a galling spur to every step, and which her 
 outward and corporeal sufferings, weakly typified. Clouds 
 could not hide what passed within, nor lightnings wither. 
 The voice of passion was louder than the thunders, though 
 they rolled like the peal of judgment. At length, faint, 
 drenched, and wearied, she sank down at the foot of a 
 blasted pine, that lifted itself up against the storm. It 
 formed the only appearance of vegetation, amid a broken 
 and dreary sweep of naked downs, which stretched far 
 on every side of her ; not a herb had taken root, over

 its bald expanse; not a blade was visible; — save this 
 solitary tree, all was black and barren. It rose near 
 the margin of a lake, the gleaming of whose waves was 
 just discernible, through the mist, as they swelled high 
 beneath the shrill and piercing wind. 
 
 Here, says the historian,* taking her poignard, she 
 engraved on the bark of the tree, in the Latin language, 
 these words, from Isaiah : " I went into the clefts of the 
 rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the 
 glory of the majesty of the Lord, when he ariseth, to 
 shake terribly the earth." She paused in her occupation, 
 and her eye fell coldly on the inky bosom of the lake, 
 now rapidly melting into the deep gloom, and becoming 
 blended with the massy cliff, by which it was half-envi- 
 roned. Suddenly, she thought it would be sweet 
 
 " To sleep amid the music of the storm," 
 
 and, since the land cast her forth, to make her sacred 
 sepulchre, where living man in vengeance came not : 
 
 *' Apparelled in her costly robe of empire, 
 To go to lie in pageantry below, 
 And flush those waters, with her gorgeous scarlet."t 
 
 But the idea of her hoarded vengeance unappeased, 
 crushed the rising inclination. Then, pondering on the 
 cruelty of her destiny, in being compelled to fly the 
 realm, over which she deemed herself entitled to rule ; 
 all outward things seemed to her, at that moment, to 
 bear a wonderful similitude to her fortunes. Every 
 thing about that wild, bleak, melancholy waste, was 
 severe and sterile, but the spirit of the tempest spake 
 not, unto her, the language of Heaven's wrath ; His voice 
 came not to her, like sounds of chiding, but from its very

 depth, seemed to attest the sympathy of inanimate na- 
 ture, with the personal indignities to which she had been 
 subjected. Thus ruminating, she again drew forth her 
 poignard, and, while all earth and sky were blent in 
 frightful commotion, she deliberately subscribed, on the 
 same pine-tree, that sad memorial of her forlorn condition, 
 whose laconic significance, comprehended a world of 
 deep and bitter emotions. " Sic fata volunt, Isabella 
 Regina." * Sic fata volunt! Alas! rejected by the 
 heart of the man, unto whom, in her womanly devotion, 
 she had surrendered all; no more a queen, her dead- 
 liest, — her arch-enemy, if not seated on her husband's 
 throne, yet wanting nothing of the realities of regal 
 power ; whilst she herself, condemned to wander forth 
 a suppliant exile, apprehensive of recapture, with all its 
 concomitant ignominy ; encompassed by difficulties on 
 every side, — she herself, the ever-haughty daughter of the 
 J agellons, exposed to all the rigour of storm and tempest.. . 
 " Nothing," she repeated to herself, a hundred times, 
 " nothing was left to her, — save hatred and revenge." 
 Oh, well might she, reduced to such extremity, lament 
 over her hard destiny, — the once all-powerful " Regina 
 Isabella !" Well might she, in imagination, fill her ears 
 with the anthem and the dirge, and take an everlasting 
 farewell of her departed greatness. 
 
 Having, perhaps, in some measure, rendered tolerable 
 those agonies, which the dispiriting appearance of uni- 
 versal nature, had too vividly recalled, by the unbur- 
 thening of her overcharged spirit, on that stricken and 
 emblematic bole, Isabella arose, with the view of leaving 
 that place of seclusion, when, as she lifted up her 
 eyes, she was somewhat startled to perceive a young, 
 etherial, and splendid form, suddenly spring, like a roe- 
 buck, from the extremity of a platform of rock, which 
 jutted over the lake. His proximity, her disturbed state

 of mind, and intentness of occupation, had, previously, 
 prevented her observing. The mailed unknown no sooner 
 lighted, just in front of her, than he threw himself grace- 
 fully on one knee, before Isabella, who gazed on the 
 beautiful apparition, in silent astonishment. She might 
 almost have supposed, that the genius of that lonely 
 spot, instructed in her history, and compassionating her 
 distress, had suddenly revealed himself to her entranced 
 senses, putting on the shape and vesture of mortality, 
 that he might hear and do her bidding. 
 
 " Unhoped for opportunity!" cried the youth. " Royal 
 lady," he proceeded, " pardon a stranger, for accosting 
 you thus abruptly. I learnt from one of your noble 
 attendants, whom I ventured to question, that you had 
 wandered from their guardianship. I followed you 
 hither, and am only too happy to obtain this inter- 
 view." 
 
 " Rise, fair sir," answered Isabella, "and say, what 
 is your object?" 
 
 The unknown quitted his kneeling posture, and, after 
 a moment's consideration, made answer : " To gratify 
 the yearning of my heart, in some measure, but chiefly 
 your advantage, madam." 
 
 "The yearning of your heart, sir; — my advantage," 
 repeated Isabella, with some surprise; " you speak rid- 
 dles." 
 
 " This is no time for long explanations," returned the 
 stranger; "but the lonely situation in which I find 
 you, — the increasing darkness, — your ignorance, alike of 
 me, and of the motives of my obtrusion, all bid me not 
 hesitate an instant in announcing myself; and, as far as 
 I am justified at present, in declaring my purpose. He is 
 the Richter Iwan, who has the honour to address you, 
 madam, and who obtests of you to rely on his word, 
 that you would act contrary to your true interests, were 
 you to prosecute your journey further, and quit the land 
 of Transylvania, for that of your birth."

 " The Richter Iwan has made an alarum of his name, 
 undoubtedly," said Isabella; "but I have yet to learn 
 what constitutes him a judge of the interests of the 
 queen regent of Hungary, or how her movements can any 
 wise concern him. Still, my lord, I must own, there is, 
 I know not what of truth, prevailing in your voice and 
 manner, that constrains me, by an irresistible impulse, to 
 
 credit your assurances ; but pray instruct me, to 
 
 whom am I indebted for this meeting; how knew the 
 Richter Iwan, he might encounter the unhappy Isabella, 
 on the confines of her daughter's kingdom." 
 
 " I gathered my information from one, whom I have 
 but lately confirmed a friend," replied Iwan, " Count 
 Maylat: but it was Count Thomas Nadastis, in your 
 highness's present retinue, who acquainted me with your 
 having quitted your chariot, to traverse these savage 
 wilds on foot. To behold you thus alone, and unattended, 
 obnoxious to the many perils of this hour, — and for the 
 
 first time since > ," the Richter stopped abruptly, 
 
 and covered his face with his hand, but almost instantly 
 he resumed, more calmly, but with an indescribable agita- 
 tion of manner, while his voice gradually lowered, till it 
 seemed nearly choked. " Oh, madam ! could you un- 
 derstand the nature of the feelings which now swell my 
 bosom, almost beyond endurance, you would not only, 
 as I fondly believe, sympathize with my agitation, but I 
 am bold to affirm, would accede without hesitation, to 
 my wish." He ceased, striving to repress that tumult of 
 emotion, which every moment became more apparent. 
 
 " Richter Iwan," said Isabella, " whatever be the 
 source of your evident discomposure, I feel, God only 
 knows why, more interested in yourself, and moved by 
 your conduct, than, without proof, in the case of a 
 stranger, I should have conceived possible. I am im- 
 pressed with the dignity of your bearing, and, in spite of 
 myself, implicitly confide in your assertions ; why this 
 should be, I know not; but after our conference, I find

 all endeavour vain to resist the impulse, which obliges 
 me to comply with your entreaty, and give up my in- 
 tention of quitting Transylvania. I make no doubt, you 
 have sufficient grounds for your request, and more, are 
 justified in suppressing them. Will you favour me, till I 
 regain the station of my friends, with your protecting 
 company?" 
 
 Thus spoke Isabella, well aware of the ability, power, 
 and reputation of the Richter, and willing to attach him 
 to her interests. But policy was not her only induce- 
 ment hereunto. In saying to Iwan, that she implicitly 
 confided in his assertions, Isabella stated the simple fact. 
 On the clear brow of the youthful hero, high honour sat 
 enthroned, as on a pedestal, and every syllable he uttered 
 came gushing from the font of truth, and bore the im- 
 press of verity and intelligence. Isabella felt the ascen- 
 dancy of his character, and the very mystery of his mo^ 
 tives excited expectations of no ordinary sort. As she 
 called to mind the wonderful tales of his achievements, 
 there arose a commotion in her soul, the cause of which 
 she could not comprehend, and which still remained as 
 powerful and as inexplicable as ever, long after she, and 
 the surprised, though delighted Czerina had reached Her- 
 manstadt, and were again lodged in their royal resi- 
 dence.

 The relative position of Transylvania, in regard to neigh- 
 bouring powers, was to all appearance little affected, by 
 the recent aggression on her independence. On the same 
 day that Martinuzzi ascertained, beyond a doubt, the 
 treasonable projects of the Hungarian barons, he was des- 
 tined to witness their utter failure. Though the faith of 
 treaties, and the obligation of honour and duty, had been 
 heretofore relied upon in vain, it was certain, the arch- 
 duke was now precluded from hostile measures, by weak- 
 ness and disability. His arms had received a blow at 
 Coloswar,from which they were not likely soon to recover. 
 The state, therefore, really enjoyed the same secure rela- 
 tions with that potentate, as were confidently believed to 
 exist, previous to his unjust invasion. 
 
 Affairs indeed, seemed to take their course, as if the 
 national independence had not been placed, in such im- 
 minent risk. But, however fair the aspect of the poli- 
 tical hemisphere, the attention of Martinuzzi was fixed on 
 more than one small cloud, just visible in the horizon, 
 which, broadening more and more, from moment to 
 moment, however unmarked of all besides, seemed to his

 prophetic soul, at once the vehicle of the thunderbolt, 
 and prognostic of the storm. 
 
 Though Solyman had withdrawn his army from the 
 principality, he had not hitherto returned to his own 
 capital, and his uncertain absence offered small grounds 
 of satisfaction, while known to be hovering on the fron- 
 tiers, at the head of such immense forces. The Richter 
 Iwan, in like manner, had retired beyond the borders, 
 but his troops were not yet disbanded; and Martinuzzi, 
 on many accounts, still more distrusted his purposes, 
 than even those of the sultan. His interposition at Colos- 
 war, had unquestionably proved the salvation of Hun- 
 gary, but his subsequent proceedings had been most 
 mysterious, and were characterised by such cold forma- 
 lity, as to verge upon disrespect to Martinuzzi, with whom, 
 he had only in a single instance, held personal commu- 
 nication. On that occasion the richter declined to un- 
 cover his face, and Martinuzzi, after a brief and embar- 
 rassing colloquy, had seen him depart with mixed feel- 
 ings, in which, however, involuntary but irrepressible 
 pain was most objective. But momentous events now 
 evened in quick succession, all of which had, for the mind 
 of Martinuzzi, more or less interest. The death of the 
 Cygani bandit, from circumstances which must be shortly 
 unfolded, touched him more deeply, than the reader might 
 suppose. That of his nephew, Maximilian, also, though in 
 a less degree, affected him. Where the regalia had 
 flown, became a subject of painful meditation ; and during 
 his absence from Hermanstadt, an event had there taken 
 place, which was truly distressing to the sensitive heart of 
 Martinuzzi. But in addition to these absorbing sources 
 of interest, other most important occurrences had evolved 
 which were calculated to influence the regent's fortunes. 
 What these were, will appear in the sequel. 
 
 It was early one morning, shortly after Martinuzzi's 
 return to Hermanstadt, that we reintroduce that person- 
 age to the reader, seated before a table, whereon several 
 
 e 5

 papers and missives, sealed and unsealed, were carelessly 
 strewn. He was in the act of superscribing one of these, 
 when the door of the apartment slowly revolved on its 
 hinges, and a young gentleman, his secretary, the son of 
 Quendi Ferens, half showed himself, but upon perceiving 
 the regent, he started back, and would have retired. 
 
 " You can enter, Emeric," said Martinuzzi, at the 
 same time motioning him to advance. 
 
 The secretary passed into the chamber, and closed the 
 door. 
 
 " I see," proceeded the regent, " the morning dawns 
 — put out the lamps." 
 
 While these artificial lights were being extinguished, 
 and that of day admitted through the casement, Marti- 
 nuzzi leant his forehead on the palm of his hand, and re- 
 mained silent. Some minutes elapsed ere he again spoke. 
 
 " Take hence these presents, Emeric," he said, without 
 raising his eyes, at the same time, extending his hand, 
 containing certain papers, towards the secretary; " and 
 despatch them straight to Richter I wan, and to the 
 Infidel — not to Constantinople — you understand ?" 
 
 Emeric received the missives, saying, " To Belgrade, 
 your highness ?" 
 
 " I fear me, not so far," said Martinuzzi ; " but you will 
 
 learn from , the retinue of the Emir of Abu Obeida, 
 
 still sojourn in the city ?" 
 
 " They have erected spacious tents for their lodgment, 
 on the site of the ruinous demesnes, bordering the castle 
 moat," answered Emeric. 
 
 " I remember," said Martinuzzi. 
 
 There was a pause, during which the secretary was 
 preparing to leave the room, when Martinuzzi spoke. 
 
 " Go not yet," he said. " In the matter of those bold 
 conspirators, Mirce, Nadastis, and Maylat, concerning 
 whom the council hath been moved, I'm worn with toil 
 — something there is — Ha!" — The regent here raised 
 his eyes, and looking earnestly into the face of his se-

 cretary, demanded whether the Duke of Eissenburg were 
 not gone from Coloswar ? 
 
 " He is in Hermanstadt, my lord," answered Emeric. 
 
 "Vicchy here? — that is sudden; — did he ask to 
 see us ?" 
 
 " He came back last night," was the reply. " Your 
 highness bade me tell him, it was your pleasure to be alone." 
 
 " I was disturbed," returned Martinuzzi ; " I should 
 not have said that else — it was not well — so — what 
 spoke we of just now ?" 
 
 " Your eminence pointed to this order," replied the 
 secretary. 
 
 " I did," said the regent ; " it is the warrant for instant 
 execution of the late castellan of Coloswar, Mirce, in 
 whose behalf the widow of the good King John doth 
 strive to blunt the edge of justice ; the state hath looked 
 again into his crime, and doth not find the lack of evi- 
 dence or lenity of guilt, which might justify remission of 
 his sentence. For Counts Maylat and Nadastis, they 
 are banished, and their estates are confiscate to the nation. 
 See to this, — a merciless compassion would overrun the 
 innocent land with traitors. Go now, and if the castel- 
 lan seek again an audience — why " Martinuzzi 
 
 broke off. 
 
 "Your highness?" inquired Emeric. 
 
 " Certainly, as you say, he " Martinuzzi again 
 
 broke off. 
 
 *' Your highness?" reiterated Emeric. 
 
 " I say, if he seek an audience," repeated Martinuzzi, 
 with more composure ; " of course you will admit him, 
 sir. Leave me, — but be in reach, if my voice summon 
 you. Why do you start and change colour ? — what is 't 
 you stare at V* 
 
 " My lord," said Emeric, in fluttering accents, at the 
 same time making a deep reverence, " your eminence's 
 confessor." 
 
 Martinuzzi, reverting his head, beheld Father Domi-

 nick, standing a few paces behind his seat, — he waved 
 his hand for his secretary to leave the room, who very 
 gladly availed himself of the permission. 
 
 " Benedicite ! my good lord," said the holy father, add- 
 ing, after a pause, " your grace is up betimes to-day." 
 With this observation, the monk seated himself on a near 
 chair, to which Martinuzzi, with a gracious inclination of 
 his person, motioned him. 
 
 " Father, your early visit is mistimed ; what, my lord, 
 am I to augur from it V* returned the regent, without 
 making a more direct reply. 
 
 " Vicchy's in Hermanstadt," said the father. 
 
 " I learnt as much erewhiles," said Martinuzzi, with a 
 blanched cheek, but unchanging voice. 
 
 " Have you, then, ordered his arrest?" asked the father. 
 
 " He has received a nee pardon for all past offences. 
 Why should we order his arrest ? He is now castellan of 
 Coloswar." 
 
 " He liked not the post, since, without leave, he hath 
 abandoned it," observed the confessor. 
 
 " Leave," repeated Martinuzzi, " what need of leave ? — 
 Are men grown slaves ? — Are we the Ottoman ?" 
 
 " I've news for you, my lord," said the confessor, 
 " which may well make you ponder deeply, ere you let 
 Vicchy remain at large." He paused for a moment, and 
 then, with marked emphasis added, " The venal and in- 
 jurious tongue of him, who spoilt your sleep, is mute for 
 evermore." 
 
 " What is 't you tell me?" asked the regent, in feeble 
 accents. 
 
 " Luke Swartz, my lord, hath reached the term, ap- 
 pointed to all men living." 
 
 Martinuzzi started from his seat, and laid his hand 
 upon the shoulder of his companion. 
 
 " Hath the earthquake ?" he cried, looking wistfully 
 beneath the cowl of the confessor. 
 
 " Even so," said the monk, filling the interval of Mar-

 tinuzzi's agitation ; " the fell destroyer's scythe hath an- 
 ticipated the headsman's axe. Luke Swartz lies in his 
 grave." 
 
 " Then," exclaimed Martinuzzi, with irrepressible emo- 
 tion, " my fears lie with him there! — Be the seal of the 
 tomb on both ! — and I am free once more, — free as the 
 universal wind — firm as the earth's centre, — master of 
 a providence, will make my fate my own ! Henceforth, 
 and for ever, I am what I was meant to be, — my proper 
 destiny." 
 
 " Restrain your exultation for awhile," said the monk, 
 " and hear further." 
 
 " The rest matters not," answered Martinuzzi ; " Luke 
 Swartz is dead, and that thought outweighs a whole host 
 of ordinary calamities — all circumstance hath lost its 
 sting — fate can touch me no more, — yet, say on." 
 
 " His death-bed was attended," resumed the con- 
 fessor. 
 
 " Death-bed ! — wast not the earthquake killed him, 
 at Mount Hielen ?" broke in the regent. 
 
 " Still, my lord, he died in his bed at Coloswar," re- 
 turned the monk, " and the Duke of Eissenburg was his 
 confessor." 
 
 " I am on the rack again — Eissenburg !" 
 
 " Ay," replied the monk, " to Eissenburg's house he 
 was borne ; and that castellan, doubtless, caught his last 
 accusing accents. So I am advised ." 
 
 " Accusing ! — how mean you ? — but I'll have him ap- 
 prehended forthwith. Vicchy," he added, in a lower tone, 
 " knew too much already. What, ho ! who waits? — Are 
 you confirmed in what you tell me? — Who waits, I say ? 
 Here, Emeric," he continued, to his secretary, who at this 
 moment made his appearance, " see this warrant executed 
 on the person of the Duke of Eissenburg, — attach him of 
 high treason — to prison with him — be speedy, sir, and 
 bring me word. — Was that state-traitor's death your 
 business with me thus early, my lord ?" inquired Marti-

 nuzzi of his confessor, shortly after the secretary left the 
 room. 
 
 " In part; not wholly," replied Father Dominick. 
 
 " We thank you, my lord," said Martinuzzi, " and 
 what made you deem, your tidings would interest us to 
 that degree, to warrant this intrusion ?" 
 
 " Intrusion ! your highness ! — but let that pass, — we 
 have been acquainted for long, and may understand one 
 another better than we dream of. We have known each 
 other through a variety of relations. When you, my 
 lord, first joined King John, in Poland, as well as in 
 your subsequent journeyings,* you measured the road 
 upon your feet, and drew your limited means from my 
 exchequer. I remember, indeed, once pressing some 
 such matter as a steed upon you ; but you were too proud 
 of your humility to accept the proffer." 
 
 "To what tend your recollections?" demanded Mar- 
 tinuzzi, with a cold and hollow smile. "These are but 
 dreams you speak of." 
 
 " So, indeed, they seem, your eminence, to your pa- 
 geant and new-coined greatness ; but the waves of pros- 
 perity have their re-acting surge. f Time, in the long 
 run, will smooth the roughest chances, and round the 
 most apparent inequalities. We may yet meet, where we 
 set out." 
 
 " This is not just, my lord ; you have found my power 
 of service, and may, in future." 
 
 " Never, again," said the monk. " In the battle of 
 Coloswar my cause of apprehension perished — the death 
 of the Cygani is the resurrection of my life. I may re- 
 sume my rank in Hungary, — thy power will be no longer

 of any benefit to me ; whether mine is destined to avail 
 your highness, remains to be seen ; but this is foreign to 
 my present purpose. The Lady Czerina, it seems, is denied 
 to Marc Antoine. I come to inquire, why you violate our 
 compact ? — Her highness is kept a close prisoner in the 
 palace : by whose orders is this incarceration ?" 
 
 "By whose should they be ? — by mine, of course, my 
 lord," answered Martinuzzi. " What then?" 
 
 " Does your highness avouch it?" said the monk. 
 " Why do you debar the Lady Czerina having intercourse 
 with her affianced husband ?" 
 
 "I do not intend that Marc Antoine Ferraro should 
 espouse the Lady Czerina," replied Martinuzzi. 
 
 The cowl fell from the monk's head, as shaken off by 
 some spasm. 
 
 " Do my ears deceive me V* he cried. tt Dare you say 
 as much to my face ?" 
 
 " No more of this, my lord," said Martinuzzi, with 
 some heat. " Dare ! But hear my reasons." 
 
 " My lord cardinal, you'll drive me mad !" exclaimed 
 Father Dominick, throwing his cowl still further from 
 his neck. " By the Great God in Heaven ! our agreement 
 shall stand good, or you shall rue the day." 
 
 Martinuzzi was about to make some reply, apparently 
 with considerable warmth, when the secretary re- appear- 
 ed. The drapery which served to conceal the monk's 
 person, and which, in his emotion, he had neglected, was 
 now hastily resumed. 
 
 " My lord," said the secretary, making a low obeisance 
 at the entrance of the chamber, " the Duke of Eissen- 
 burg, within this instant, was in the act of crossing the 
 castle court." 
 
 " He is arrested ?" interrupted Martinuzzi eagerly. 
 
 " As your highness gave orders," replied the youth. 
 
 " Let him be committed to close custody." 
 
 " He adjured your eminence, on every consideration,

 to grant him an audience before imprisoning him," said 
 the secretary. 
 
 " To close custody, sir," authoritatively repeated the 
 regent. "That missive to the Richter — despatch it 
 forthwith. Leave us. — And now, my friend, will you 
 hearken to my explanation V* proceeded Martinuzzi, 
 turning to his confessor. 
 
 "Some subterfuge!" cried the monk, disdainfully. 
 " You deem all danger buried in the dungeon of Eissen- 
 burg — you may find yourself mistaken." 
 
 " Marc Antoine is unworthy of the hand of the Lady 
 Czerina," said Martinuzzi. 
 
 " Who dares to say so ?" cried the monk. " What 
 new light has broke in upon you? What lay you to his 
 charge ?" 
 
 " That he is the paramour of Queen Isabella," said 
 the regent. 
 
 " And if he be?" began the monk. 
 
 "And if he be!" interrupted Martinuzzi haughtily; 
 " I tell you, my lord, he is. The shame was hinted at 
 by the dying Balassi. I have since verified his words. 
 Antoine must seek a wife elsewhere ; you, my lord, will 
 have the power to match him worthily : — at all events, 
 he shall never wed the Queen of Hungary." 
 
 " This is your determination, lord cardinal ?" 
 
 " It is my fixed determination," answered Martinuzzi. 
 
 " Have you weighed the possible consequence?" in- 
 quired the monk, with marked and significant expression. 
 
 " Consequence !" repeated Martinuzzi, proudly, " in this 
 case the split is no more to me than the split waves, that 
 strike against the vessel's side, but alter not her course." 
 
 " My lord cardinal, I take my leave," said the holy 
 father, moving slowly towards the door ; " I shall return, 
 but in another guise. I perceive, thou deemest thyself 
 impregnable; but, however hemmed in on every side, thy 
 fastnesses of falsehood may yet be stormed. Thou know-

 est not, at present, how I am armed ; when next we 
 speak, I will display my strength. If, then, like a mad- 
 man, you persist in opposing this alliance, the prospect 
 of which hath for so Ions; been our mutual cement — if 
 you deny our contract, your doom is sealed, proud pre- 
 late !" — Thus having spoken, Father Dominick made the 
 regent a haughty reverence, and withdrew. 
 
 The eyes of Martinuzzi remained fixed on the door, 
 through which he had passed. " Arrogant noble !" he 
 said, as closing, it shut out the minatory language, and 
 gloomy and displeased aspect of the monk ; " I would 
 not, for the world, thou wert acquainted with half what 
 Hubert Vicchy hath cognition of; then, indeed, were my 
 state pitiable. Yet he hinted at something — no, that's 
 clearly impossible ; only Swartz knew, and the seal is on 
 his lip, and living, he divined not who lurked beneath the 
 robe of Father Dominick, or else — . Well, he is dead, 
 God pardon him ! — and me, for my unnatural exultation. 
 What kindred thought hath such strange fascination 
 over me ? Is not the spectre laid in the cold tomb ? Then 
 why this suggestion of evil, which yet I loath as hell, 
 and loathing, cling to ? Eissenburg is in prison, in my 
 power — Eissenburg ! that, from the ashes of my deadly 
 terror, hath sprung new fanged. Well, I surely would 
 not." Martinuzzi crossed the chamber with agitated 
 tread. " Oh ! mighty fiend !" he inly ejaculated, striking 
 with his right hand that aching spot, where his heart col- 
 lapsed, and with the other clasping his forehead, where 
 his brain seemed to him to swell beyond its continent — 
 " Oh ! mighty fiend! avaunt ! begone!" He paused, and 
 then resumed, in a lower tone — " Kind Jesus ! I pray 
 thee, by thy passion, interpose. Quell this thought, this 
 tempting thought ; let it pass from me, now, — now, and 
 for ever !" Saying these words, as if to lay the demon that 
 possessed him, Martinuzzi crossed himself, and sunk 
 down upon the floor before the crucifix, where, wrapt in 
 solemn communings, we leave him for the present.

 The day, which we have just ushered to the notice of 
 our readers, in the foregoing colloquy, came on in la- 
 bouring cloud and tempest. Driving rain fell unintermit- 
 tingly throughout the morning, the wind swept along the 
 streets of Hermanstadt in rapid and successive gusts ; 
 the dark precipice, fronting the citadel, which we have 
 heretofore commemorated, was loosened at its foundation, 
 and an immense fragment of rock toppled down with 
 violence on the fabrics beneath, crushing them into a 
 heap of undistinguishable ruin. The pellucid basins 
 which ornamented the new town, where the principal 
 streets intersected one another, and also most of the 
 canals which divided those thoroughfares, overflowed 
 their banks, and bore upon their inundating tide huge 
 rafters, and other loose materials that lay about. 
 
 "Implentur fossae, et cava flumina crescunt, 
 Cum sonitu." * 
 
 During the past night, the Rider of the storm seemed 
 to have sat in judgment on the dark and haggard city, 
 to deliver it over, as the day dawned, to the immiti<- 
 gable wrath of his ministering elements. 
 
 We take up the thread of our narrative at noon-day, 
 when, the massy columns of cloud, rolling upward to 
 the heavens, there ensued a short-lived pause in the fury 
 of the tempest. About this time, the sunshine, winning 
 through the trees at intervals, irradiated the wrapping 
 Spanish cloaks of two men, who had planted themselves 
 for shelter, or, more probably, for concealment, at the 
 back of a close row of lofty oaks, that bordered a long 
 avenue in the royal gardens. They seemed tired of their 
 watch, and by muttered imprecation and low, peevish 
 rejoinder, manifested their impatience. These were pre- 
 
 * Virgil. We are half tempted, but with diffidence, to think that Ali- 
 son, in calling the " implentur fossae" " an unnecessary and a degrading 
 circumstance," is a little too hypercritical. See " Essays on the Nature 
 and Principles of Taste," E. i. chap. 2.

 sently joined by a third person, similarly enveloped from 
 head to foot, but in a garment composed of more costly 
 materials. The large Spanish hat of this latter was 
 looped with diamonds, and his bearing and mien seemed 
 to betoken him a nobleman of the highest rank. The 
 huge and intervening trunks prevented them seeing each 
 other, till they almost touched. The latter individual 
 stopped abruptly. 
 
 "What's your report, to-day, my friends?" he de- 
 manded, in those courteous accents so indicative of real 
 dignity. 
 
 " The same, your excellency, as for the last se'nnight. 
 How know you our appointed victim will pass here at 
 all ?" 
 
 " From having seen him frequently traverse this path, 
 in the direction of the palace. He will again, I do not 
 doubt — but, in any event, since you will not lose your 
 hire, you can afford to be patient." 
 
 " There's reason in what you say, your excellency, I 
 confess ; but may we not now adjourn till to-morrow ? 
 We both of us are, for all the world, like two St. Niobes, 
 oozing away into rain-water. Your Ethiop will hardly 
 walk abroad on such a day, unless, i' faith, he guessed 
 he would become fairer by the experiment, which is not 
 so unlikely." 
 
 " Silence ! and sconce yourselves, knaves ; he's here," 
 said he, who was the superior of the party. 
 
 At the moment, voices and footsteps became audible, 
 and the three cautiously drew back. Presently, two 
 persons, in close conference, made their appearance at 
 the end of the walk. 
 
 "You say you served the Richter Iwan?" observed 
 one of these, habited in a garb not uncharacteristic of 
 that tropical clime of which his dingy complexion bespake 
 him a native. 
 
 " Till lately, but now, the castellan of Coloswar," was 
 the response.

 " And your present lord has a message for me, from 
 the Richter ?" 
 
 "Therefore was I ordered to seek you out; and I was 
 bid to add, moreover, that my lord would speak to you 
 on a matter touching the secret, hidden in the crown of 
 Hungary." 
 
 " Ha ! Luke Swartz has spoken then ? Did the Duke 
 of Eissenburg say that ?" 
 
 "Those were my lord's very words, sir; but where you 
 will meet with him at present, I cannot say, for he went 
 abroad betimes, and has not since returned." 
 
 " Where did the castellan take up his abode ?" 
 
 " In the higher part of the town; the last house over- 
 looking the esplanade." 
 
 " I shall make it my business to see your lord," said 
 the black; " you can retrace your path to the city. My 
 road leads onward." 
 
 The pair shortly parted, but the black had not pro- 
 ceeded many paces, when he was set upon by two ruffians. 
 By his conduct, however, it became evident, he was de- 
 ficient, neither in prudence, nor in courage, and as he 
 was armed, his assailants met with a warm reception. 
 They were, notwithstanding, gradually obtaining the ad- 
 vantage, when suddenly a rustling sound, like that of a 
 roebuck, bounding through a brake, was heard in the 
 adjacent copsewood; and the next instant, a young ca- 
 valier darted upon the scene of action. He seconded 
 the efforts of the African, with so much spirit, that one 
 of the villains was presently struck dead updn the spot, 
 while the other only evited a like fate, by betaking 
 himself to flight. 
 
 " Excellent friend, thou art not hurt," said the cavalier. 
 
 " I had been to some purpose, but for thy generous 
 aid, Antoine," replied the black; u I was in the act of 
 seeking you, when way-laid by yon runaway and his 
 fellow, but he may yet bring others to attack us, so we 
 were better not longer remain exposed to this terrible

 storm. I have much to say to you; we will proceed to 
 our usual place of rendezvous." The two men moved 
 silently onward, and took shelter under the ruinous 
 porchway, of which we made mention in an earlier 
 manuscript. 
 
 The black first broke silence. " You have received 
 despatches from Vienna, I doubt not, since we lately 
 spoke?" he said. 
 
 " Yes; from my honoured grandsire," replied Marc 
 Antoine ; " and I have likewise to inform you, that sub- 
 sequent to our last conference, I have again vainly so- 
 licited speech of my adored Czerina." 
 
 " We'll talk, sir, of that anon," said the African, with 
 some coldness ; " and what said the palatine ? for in my 
 eyes, the venerable Jerome Lascus is still palatine of 
 Serradia." 
 
 " Oh, my friend!" cried Antoine, " he has revealed to 
 me my parentage, — he has told me " 
 
 " Hath he sir?" interrupted the African, in a low, 
 deep, and stern tone of voice ; " and canst thou have 
 learned, that thou art the lineal descendant of the time- 
 honoured line of Pereny? — a house, the noblest in all the 
 land, that hath, ere this, given kings to Hungary and Bo- 
 hemia. Canst thou have learned, thy father liveth, eager 
 to embrace his sole surviving son, and have room in thy 
 breast for any other emotions, than those of exulting 
 pride and filial aspirations? Canst thou couple with this 
 intelligence of thy grandsire, an expression of aught re- 
 sembling discontent, because, forsooth, the portals of this 
 palace are closed to thee ?" 
 
 Here Ferraro (for we will still occasionally term Count 
 Marc Antoine of Pereny by the name, to which the reader 
 is habituated) broke in, — " Oh, spare your reproaches !" 
 
 " Sir," interrupted the African, in the same severe tone 
 of displeasure as at first, " were the graf Pereny of my 
 mind, he would disown a sou, whose heart did not bound 
 with extacy, at being informed of his descent. Do you

 see yon donjon keep? Thy ancestors, Marc Antoine, 
 have, from within those walls, made known their will to 
 Transylvania. The royal standard of Pereny hath floated 
 from that pinnacle, where now, — look yonder ! do you 
 behold the ensign of that usurping priest ?" 
 
 Ferraro started, and changing colour, replied, that he 
 did. 
 
 " Thou hast but lately learnt thy high descent, Antoine ; 
 thou hast yet to understand the duties, thy new rank in- 
 volves, the claim thy country hath upon thee." The black 
 paused for an answer; but Ferraro, partly through sur- 
 prise, and partly overawed by the energy of his manner, 
 remained silent. "Dost faint already? Then thou art 
 chicken-livered, and stand'st in need of counsel, lest, 
 when thy father lays bare his soul to thee, thou strike 
 him, all aghast. — I've that to spur thee on, shall make 
 thee top his hopes. Marc Antoine, the lady of thy 
 homage, — she, whom I, weakly trusting to the honour of 
 Martinuzzi, had promised thee to wife, is now to be 
 transferred, it seems, to some more honourable claimant 
 than is the son of Peter, Count Pereny." 
 
 " Ah! exclaimed Antoine," impetuously; " I should 
 like to set eyes on the man, who dares contest my right 
 to the hand of Czerina; she has told me that she loved 
 me; and not, while one drop of blood flows in these veins, 
 will I resign my pretensions." 
 
 "I know thee now again," said the African; " this 
 heat strikes out bravely. Thy father will not have to 
 blush at thy degeneracy. So thou art denied access 
 within these w r alls, — within these walls, that thy great 
 ancestors, — but no matter, — denied access by whom ? 
 
 By the tyrant kiral of that Erdely, where formerly I , 
 
 I would say where your father, Antoine, ruled as waivode,

 Antoine, bend down your ear, and list to me; the north 
 wind rages, indeed, and shakes palpably this regal dome; 
 the flood-gates from above are loosened, and heaven and

 earth seem toppling from their base, but heed it not." 
 The -African pausing, stooped his head, and in a whisper- 
 ing but distinct tone proceeded : — " List thou to me I say, 
 while I, in voice more low than the soft breeze, creeping 
 at midnight, through the sleeping boughs, to wake them 
 into motion, discourse to thee of most mysterious matters, 
 touching the state of Hungary." At that moment, a 
 single vivid and lengthened flash of lightning quivered 
 within that delapidated porchway, which they had chosen 
 for the scene of their conference. The countenance of 
 the twain became tinged by the ghastly radiance, and the 
 eyes of the African seemed to glare out of their sockets, 
 as, laying his hand heavily on the arm of his companion, 
 he said ; " What ailest thee? thou dost not observe me, 
 Antoine." 
 
 " Indeed, but I mark thy words," replied the envoy. 
 
 " 'Tis well thou dost," returned the black; "and 
 yet," he continued, muttering to himself in so low a tone 
 that Ferraro could not catch the sentence, " all may be 
 adjusted ; and why should I, to no purpose, divulge." 
 Interrupting himself, " Marc Antoine," proceeded the 
 black, more audibly, "'tis not my part, but that of thy 
 sire, to lay bare to thee that monstrous piece of work, 
 I hinted at erewhiles. Doth not thy heart prompt thee, 
 to make one inquiry after the author of thy being?" 
 
 " I was referred to thee, and would, ere this," replied 
 Ferraro, " but that " 
 
 " But that thy heart," interrupted Scipio, with an air 
 of displeasure, " was over-brimmed already with a light 
 passion." 
 
 Here the African was broken in upon in his turn : 
 "A light passion, sir!" echoed Ferraro; "thou dost 
 presume " 
 
 " Presume !" repeated the African. " Young gen- 
 tleman, I smile at, and forgive your folly ; but thy father, 
 who hath the best right and title to direct thee, shall 
 counsel thee in this. Yet mark me, Antoine ! — If, in-

 deed, Martinuzzi oppose thy union with the Lady Czerina, 
 there will a thing transpire, something almost beyond 
 belief, which, as though an avenging voice from Heaven 
 forbade the banns, will preclude the possibility of this 
 alliance !" 
 
 " Wherefore should the regent's veto be so absolute ?" 
 inquired Ferraro ; " the lady is no less his queen than 
 mine. Such tyranny, as that thou speakest of, may de- 
 feat its own purpose. I will resist the cardinal's decree ; 
 and, let the worst betide, I can but die." 
 
 The African looked down in a deep reverie. " Count 
 Pereny," he said, after a pause, " will explain all this ; 
 thou, as yet, seest dimly, walking, as it were, in a dream. 
 But meet me to-morrow, at midnight, here, as usual, and, 
 perchance, thou shalt embrace thy father ; if not, I shall 
 have to lay bare such treasonable practices of yonder 
 high-throned prelate, against the house of John of Za- 
 pola, as, I trust, will rouse thy loyal indignation. I 
 know what's rushing to thy lips ; control thyself, and 
 — hark ! those shouts were scarce the murmuring of the 
 wind, — something pursues the thunder in his track ; — 
 ha ! that sound was human." 
 
 The African's ears served him faithfully. There gra- 
 dually mingled, with the moaning winds and plashing 
 of the tempest, a low, rushing sound, which, as it be- 
 came more audible, was discovered to be the clamour of 
 loud and angry voices. The two sprang to the door- 
 way, — the black breathless, and with lips apart. As 
 the tumult approached nearer, they caught sight of a 
 party of men, indiscriminately armed, with sticks, staves, 
 swords, and halberts. These were speeding tumultuously 
 towards the ruinous porch, that sheltered Ferraro and 
 his sable companion, who, as the hubbub came nearer 
 and nearer, could distinguish the exclamations, that lived 
 awhile, amid the din of elements. 
 
 " The murderous rascals ! — this way they fled, the 
 villains !"

 MANUSCRIPT XXVII. 97 
 
 " Ha !" cried one, pointing to the dilapidated door- 
 way, " there they stand ! — behold! — hola ! let us on — 
 on !" 
 
 Ferraro and the African drew back. " Antoine," ob- 
 served the latter, " the villain, whom you slew in my 
 defence, is, doubtless, supposed to have met his death 
 unfairly ; and I fear, that yon tumultuous rout are now 
 upon our track." 
 
 " What is to be done ?" asked Ferraro. 
 
 " I would not care," replied the black, " to await the 
 coming of these people, and explain away their cause of 
 misapprehension ; at the worst, my will were sufficient 
 to avouch the act, they charge us with ; and, at any other 
 time, it would be but right of us to boldly confront such 
 an accusation. But now, high discoveries are on the 
 eve of being effected, which must not run the chance 
 of any failure. Let us leave this place." 
 
 Saying this, the African passed a few paces further 
 within the deeply-shadowed porch way, and, stooping, 
 applied his finger to a small iron spring upon the ground. 
 This was so minute in form, and so carefully concealed 
 amid a heap of grout and other ruinous materials, that 
 no eye, unless apprised of its existence, could have de- 
 tected it. Immediately, an oblong flag-stone, apparently 
 deep sunk in the earth, slid a little on one side, and dis- 
 covered a small trap-door. Ferraro was struck with 
 astonishment. The shouts and cries grew louder ; the 
 pursuers were evidently within a few paces of the door- 
 way. 
 
 " Follow me," said the black, as he dived into the 
 subterranean retreat, to which this secret aperture gave 
 access. 
 
 Ferraro, without a moment's hesitation, plunged after 
 him, down a descent of some six or seven feet; and his 
 companion, having first, by the pressure of a counter- 
 spring, restored the stone to its usual deceptive position, 
 involved him, for a short distance, in a narrow, vaulted,

 and circuitous passage, which, leading gradually upwards, 
 at last seemed to reach its termination in a heavy door, 
 through which they were admitted into an oaken cham- 
 ber of moderate dimensions, in every way, save in respect 
 of its being uncommonly lofty. It had a dusky and un- 
 inhabited air. At the upper end was a single, small cir- 
 cular window, deeply indented in the wall, several feet 
 from the floor, through which alone the gloomy autumnal 
 day-light obtained admission. Beneath this window was 
 a dark and small recess. This room would have been 
 wholly divested of household furniture, but for a single 
 wooden chair, over which hung a large, massive, and, by 
 the worn and threadbare condition of the canvass, evi- 
 dently very ancient portrait, of some Transylvanian king 
 or warrior. A door, elaborately carved, and at present 
 closed, corresponded with the one on the opposite side 
 of the apartment, through which Ferraro and the black 
 entered. 
 
 " We are now within the queen's palace," whispered 
 Antoine's sable conductor — " 1 must even leave you for 
 a minute, to ascertain our further progress in safety. Be 
 still as death during my absence, for the suite of apart- 
 ments you now are in, have a strange echo. Remain in 
 this recess, the gloomof which, if by chance he — anyone — 
 should enter the room, will serve to conceal your person, 
 until my return, or if I cannot do so, conveniently, until 
 the individual whom I shall appoint to guide you with- 
 out the palace walls, make his appearance." 
 
 Without waiting for Ferraro's reply, the African turned 
 slowly away, and availing himself of the chair beneath, 
 raised himself to a level with the portrait, and then, by 
 some mechanical process, caused it to revolve open, in 
 the manner of a door, through which, as if by enchant- 
 ment, he immediately made his exit. 
 
 Ferraro, as the portrait resumed its station on the 
 wainscot, suddenly found himself standing alone in the 
 interior of the royal palace, whither he had been con-

 ducted so unexpectedly, and by so secret a mode of access. 
 Thus left to his own solitary thoughts, he had nothing 
 better to do, than to ponder on the peculiar cruelty of 
 his fate, in placing him under the same roof, and possibly 
 within a few yards of the mistress of his affections, with- 
 out his being able to make his proximity known to that 
 lady. Ferraro was still deeply absorbed in musings, 
 which, by some mental association, were continually re- 
 curring to the singularity of his present situation, when 
 all at once, low voices broke on his ear, and presently he 
 heard a key turn in the lock of the door, opposite to the 
 one, by which, the African had introduced him to the 
 apartment. He had hardly time to enshroud his person in 
 the gloom of the recess, beneath the solitary window, as 
 in case of his finding his privacy invaded, had been re- 
 commended, ere the door half enclosed, and two indivi- 
 duals passing forward, were seen to occupy the opening 
 space of the door-way. The heart of Ferraro leaped to 
 his throat, as his orb of sight lighting on the spot, dis- 
 cerned, at the first glance, in the drooping slight form of 
 one of these, the object of its impassioned worship. But 
 now, her usually bright eye was dimmed, and owned a 
 wandering expression. Her lip and her thin cheek were 
 alike pale ; her gait was languid, and it seemed as if her 
 youth and beauty were decaying under some cankering 
 blight, and her whole being, fading away, slow and almost 
 imperceptibly, as the soft light of eve, by dull, but un- 
 interrupted degrees, evanishes into darkness. However 
 pained, Ferraro's amazement, or to speak more correctly, 
 his horror, almost betrayed his presence, as he transferred 
 his gaze to the man, who was apparently holding familiar 
 colloquy with the Queen of Hungary, He was one, 
 whom Antoine little anticipated beholding at that mo- 
 ment, and least of all, in the company of Czerina. The 
 cowl over-shadowed the face, and the dark cloth closely 
 enveloped the form, of the mysterious and dreaded Father

 Dominick. Ferraro drank in their doubtful discourse 
 with all his ears. 
 
 The arms of Czerina were stretched out, half in caress, 
 and half imploringly, towards the holy father. " For- 
 give me, ere you set me free again," said the royal maid, 
 beseechingly ; " forgive me, that I cannot so readily wed 
 to please you, as I could wish — but I cannot, no indeed." 
 
 " Lady," said the monk, in a voice, the solemn cadence 
 of which, struck on Ferraro's heart, like some deeply 
 melancholy strain, with which, though he could not recall 
 the air, he was most familiar, — " Lady, this union would 
 not only be most auspicious for your subjects, though I 
 must not tell you wherefore, but likewise is indispensable 
 to the repose of your future life. Credit me, if I have 
 seemed harsh, 'tis thy welfare that prompted, and will con- 
 tinue to prompt my words, no less than my determination 
 herein. This alliance must take place, otherwise all 
 to come of thy frail existence will be wretched — oh ! 
 wretched beyond imagination." 
 
 "Alas!" cried Czerina, in piteous accents, " were my 
 wretchedness without previous parallel, it cannot exceed 
 that, which will be my lot, if I must weary of a lingering 
 life, and be disposed of thus." In saying these words, 
 irrepressible tears gushed from the azure eyes of Czerina, 
 which she turned aside her head in order to hide. 
 
 The countenance of the monk could not be seen, under 
 the shadow of his cowl — he moved a few paces with falter- 
 ing steps, and there ensued a mutual and thrilling pause. 
 Father Dominick first strove to break silence, but his 
 deep organic tones seemed smothered, with some internal 
 emotion. " Czerina," he began, " Lady, — lady Czerina, 
 
 my dear child, you must acquire more firmness, or 
 
 how pale, how very pale thou turnest. Oh, dry thy tears ! 
 each drop thou sheddest weighs on my spirit, like a several 
 poison, bitterer far than aconite, and perchance no 
 less deadly. — Yes, lady," he proceeded with extreme

 earnestness, " to be doomed to see thee decline into a 
 shadow of thy former self, waste all away, is a meet curse 
 for me ; I wont deny it ; but, girl, shouldst thou indeed 
 dissolve into an early tomb, think not thou wilt die sinless, 
 lay not that soothing consolation to thy heart, for know 
 (and let the thought induce thee to bear this world's in- 
 fliction, like a Christian, )in thus indulging thyself unto 
 death, thou art committing an incalculable sin." 
 
 " Now God forbid!" ejaculated Czerina ; " and do 
 you take pity on me too; lest, — as in the hush of night, I 
 often dream of late, — my glass of life run down his few 
 remaining sands, before that hated bridal, with which 
 you threat me." 
 
 " And thus," said the monk, with some asperity, 
 " wilt thou, (and not unwittingly, after my warning), 
 perpetrate a crime, revolting ! monstrous ! — so monstrous, 
 Czerina, as to have been held impossible, by sagest law- 
 givers. Take thought ! — have a care what thou art 
 about, and weary the saints with prayers to bend thy 
 stubborn will, to my desires ; — this hated bridal, as in 
 thy self-will, and overweening pride, thou termest it, in 
 this world, is not to be eluded, — there is no retreat, save 
 in the unfathomable ocean of futurity, whither plunge 
 thou canst not, unless, as I have just hinted, with inex- 
 piable sin to drag thee down; — thou canst not die, my 
 child ! By Heavens ! thou must not !" 
 
 These last words were enunciated, by the holy father, 
 in a suffocating tone, of indescribable commiseration, 
 and suiting his gesture to his language, he long hung 
 over the fragile form of the youthful queen, in mute and 
 affecting solicitude. 
 
 At length, Czerina again spake, raising, momentarily, 
 her watery eyes, to the steadfast gaze of the monk, but 
 dropping them, ere she finished the sentence. 
 
 "The queen, my mother, sir, by my father's testa- 
 ment, she was to have a voice in my disposal, — I will 
 consult her grace."

 The monk seemed hardly conscious of what our he- 
 roine had spoken ; his eyes continued fixed, in earnest 
 scrutiny of the snowy complexion, and exquisite linea- 
 ments of her downcast countenance. 
 
 " Thy mother ! saidst thou V* he abstractedly rejoined, 
 after a minute's thought. 
 
 " Thou heardest me," returned Czerina, in that haughty 
 tone, natural to her, but which, in the present instance, 
 appeared to escape her lips, involuntarily. 
 
 "Mother! My child!" murmured the monk, in a 
 tone of deep melancholy, but still, seemingly, lost in 
 abstraction. 
 
 There was a pause. 
 
 " How doth thy voice ever fill me with strange awe !" 
 observed Czerina. 
 
 The monk laid his hand on the maiden's head, and, 
 while stroking down her hyacinthine curls, said, in a 
 deep, low tone, as if his secret thought found uncon- 
 scious voice : " How all thy mother's wound into thy 
 form ! Just like her tresses, beams thine auburn hair !" 
 
 " Nay now, you jest," returned Czerina, in some sur- 
 prise. " My mother's hair, sir, is not auburn. 
 
 " Was, was, child, ivas /" exclaimed the monk, in 
 deep and melancholy accents ; " but I wander — for a 
 moment." Then resuming his composure, he continued : 
 " Thou namedst the queen, awhile ago, — thou erredst. 
 What voice hath Isabella ? Few women know what, in 
 the world, is its true policy — the widow of King John, 
 the least of all — so in the state and senate-house, they 
 leave no room for thee, or for thy mother. Time there 
 was, indeed, but not for long, when matrons met in par- 
 liament, and from their carved and ivory stalls,* young 
 gallants would receive a hint, how proper rich robes, all 
 blushing like confusion, beseemed their persons. That 
 was not so much amiss ; but affairs of government, and

 such weighty matters, are meant for men to manage." 
 The monk paused, as if for a reply, which Czerina not 
 immediately rendering, he said; "I must now leave 
 you to reflect on what has passed between us ; I will re- 
 turn though. Light us again, fair lady, — relume those 
 orbs." 
 
 Czerina answered by a low sob, the utterance of which, 
 she evidently did her utmost to repress. 
 
 " Why wilt thou grieve me, child ?" said the monk, 
 abruptly, breaking away from the young queen, and 
 crossing the chamber, in the middle of which, however, 
 he stopped, and turning towards her, subjoined with 
 uncommon solemnity of manner : — " Queen of Hungary, 
 thou must learn better to command thy feelings, than 
 to weep away thy strength and colour thus. Thou 
 feedest too much the passion of thy soul. It should be 
 made subserve the interests of the realm, committed, by 
 the King of kings, to thy authority." 
 
 Czerina made no reply ; and the monk immediately 
 passed on, mounted the chair, and then added : " Retire 
 now to thy chamber, and expect me to return ; — I will 
 return." 
 
 Saying these words, Father Dominick found egress, 
 after the same secret mode, by which the African had, 
 previously, effected his retreat. 
 
 Ferraro stood transfixed on the same spot, where he 
 had remained an astonished witness of the foregoing 
 scene; his soul panted for some explanation of so mys- 
 terious a colloquy, — and his joy at the opportunity of 
 conversing with the Lady Czerina, was qualified only by 
 his alarm, at her half-open and blanched lips, and evi- 
 dent nervous condition at the moment. While he was 
 yet hesitating, how to accost her without occasioning 
 her too sudden a surprise, Czerina clasped her hands 
 upon her eyes, whose long dark fringes overflowed with 
 the heart's rain. Presently she breathed a few words, in

 that low and dulcet voice, which was so peculiarly her 
 own, that Ferraro would often feel, when gazing, for any 
 time on her etherial countenance, and fragile frame, so 
 purified from all taint of earthly grossness, that some 
 embodied piece of harmony floated before his eyes, and 
 he would start the self-betraying colour to her cheek, by 
 whispering in her ear, with that seductive grace he knew 
 so well to wear, that the artist who would catch her 
 likeness,* must know, to dip his colours in the spheres, 
 and trick her ofF, " entangling the wild winds, "f since 
 verily he inclined to fear, that were she approached too 
 rudely, she would melt all away into a tune. It was in 
 those melodious accents — 
 
 " Untwisting all the chains that tie, 
 The hidden soul of harmony,"* 
 
 that Czerina now suspired to herself, — " He said he would 
 return. Oh no ! not again. I cannot stand before him. 
 Hush! no, it was my heart. When I am dead, — yes, I 
 feel I shall perish before that hated union. My bridal 
 sheets will be a fold of lead, in some untrodden spot; when 
 I lie there, which will be soon, I think, and hope. — How 
 
 I shall abhor the name of . My self-will indeed! 
 
 what, — marry his choice, and I love another! — I can 
 bear to die, and yet it were too much to die of that man's 
 majesty. Oh man ! most strangely terrible thou art to 
 me, yet as I live, I cannot hate thee ; what spell is in 
 the form I shrink before, yet for the world I would not 
 he were not?" Here a deep and involuntary sigh of 
 Ferraro quivered on the ear of the fair soliloquist. She 
 started. — "Mercy! what's that?" she cried; " if thou

 beany other, speak, — who's there?" Ferraro, dubious 
 how to act, made no reply; and Czerina, supposing her- 
 self mistaken, went on. " Methought a breath of sym- 
 pathy stole on my ear: how could I think so? I am too 
 high to court regard. — Alas! what friend have I in all 
 the world?" The hands of the royal maiden fell listless 
 by her side; not the least shade of the rose remained on 
 her pale cheek, and as she stood, all mute and motion- 
 less, she looked some sculptured personification of deep 
 grief. 
 
 " How beautiful!" communed Ferraro with himself; 
 " I deemed that nothing half so fair, could ever last so 
 long. Hath she no heavenly feeling of herself ? I'll not 
 believe else." 
 
 A soft sigh escaped Czerina, as she repeated, — " No 
 friend have I in all the world, — my mother? No!" 
 
 " What music," proceeded Ferraro, in his extacy ; 
 " flows not from her parted lips? What perfume surfeits 
 the luxuriant air, if not her breathing?" 
 
 "No friend," sighed Czerina, " in all the world; — 
 Martinuzzi? No." 
 
 "Oh ye saints! how like to ye she stands! If that 
 arm be white, marmoreal rocks, hewn in the Parian earth, 
 are spotted. Why did she weep? Lo ! still delicious 
 drops hang trembling on those lids, rejecting the bright 
 flashes of her eyes, whose heat will drink them soon." 
 " No friend in all the world ! — Ferraro ? Yes, Ferraro." 
 " Did she not muse my name?" said the rapt listener; 
 " it does not sound familiar to me;" he ceased, and 
 then, after drinking in at his eyes, another intoxicating 
 draught of passion, he felt unable any longer to control 
 himself. Emitting his whole soul in the tender syllables, 
 he softly whispered, — " My queen!" 
 
 " Holy Mary ! Who spoke?" inquired the maiden. 
 " My queen !" repeated Ferraro. 
 " Is it a voice, that mocks my failing senses? Marc 
 Antoine, or his spirit?"

 " Czerina," exclaimed the incautious lover ; " be not 
 alarmed, — 'tis I." 
 
 Thus speaking, he emerged from his concealment, just 
 in time to receive our startled heroine, in his encircling 
 arms, her almost fainting form clinging instinctively to 
 his pressure. Oh! for the pen of the author of Devereux, 
 to describe the thrilling moments that ensued, when 
 every nerve of Ferraro's frame, tingled in the embrace of 
 the delicate girl, as she, half unconsciously, weaved her 
 arms around him. If, as we have seen, her visible pre- 
 sence, long denied to him, excited his romantic tempe- 
 rament to a degree of enthusiasm, bordering on phrenzy, 
 how must passion have concurred to inflame his senses, 
 when he found himself in bodily contact, with the lovely 
 creature, who constituted his heaven upon earth! " That 
 is the exact time," says one, who, whenever he ventures 
 upon the theme, writes evidently con amore, " when love 
 has reached its highest point ; and when, to renounce the 
 object beloved, is the most deadly sacrifice ;"* but, how- 
 ever exquisite the topic, it touches (like the style of 
 Burke) the verge of all that is objectionable, for which 
 reason we dismiss it. Either Ferraro's chafing her tem- 
 ples, or his pressing her to his bosom, was so far success- 
 ful, that soon the royal maiden's senses were in some 
 measure restored. After some minutes of delicious si- 
 lence, which she was the first to break, a faint glow of 
 the most lovelyred retinged her cheek, and blushed through 
 all her frame. 
 
 " Antoine," she murmured, in a low tone, " how you 
 alarmed me !" Then, as she gently struggled, with a 
 feeling of ingenuous shame, to disengage herself, from the 
 ardent embrace of her lover, she proceeded : " Why did 
 you run this risk ? — by what magic do I find you 
 here V 
 
 Ferraro briefly explained the circumstances, that led to

 his being left alone in the apartment. When he had 
 done, Czerina bit her lip, as if in vexation, and, for a 
 minute, her spirit seemed locked up in some unpleasasant 
 contemplation. 
 
 " I distrust that Scipio," she at length said ; " it may 
 be all for the best, but I hope, you have good grounds to 
 go upon, in confiding to his honour." 
 
 "The best in the world," returned Ferraro; " my grand- 
 sire's recommendation — his own manifest integrity, and, 
 more than all, — Oh, Czerina ! he will, to-morrow, intro- 
 duce me to my father." 
 
 " I knew not that your father lived," said Czerina, 
 in a tone betokening her interest. 
 
 " But he does, love," replied Ferraro, " and it is my 
 pride, that he can boast a heart as high with noble flame, 
 as any of your grace's lieges, being every way their 
 equal, or their lord ; nay, my sainted-queen, the heaven- 
 blue veins that lace and warm and swell thy lively bo- 
 som, wave with a stream, more lovely and more bright, 
 than flows within the channels of this arm ; but, save its 
 royalty, no nobler." 
 
 The sweet face of Czerina pourtrayed her pleased as- 
 tonishment. 
 
 "I am not glad, either," she said, after a pause; 
 " alas, Antoine, the nearer heaven, the nearer thun- 
 der!*" 
 
 "The nearer bliss and love rather; but let's talk of 
 something else. Do you tell me now, for I burn to learn, 
 what could induce you to hold such long discourse, with 
 that dire character. You were not at shrift, and if he 
 be the confessor of your guardian, he is not yours." 
 
 The conscious maiden instantaneously changed colour, 
 and every limb quivered as if with a separate agony. 
 
 "Ask me not!" she wildly exclaimed. "Ask me 
 not, Antoine! Oh, would to God!" she continued.

 " some gentle death would seal my lips, even in the act 
 of speaking !" 
 
 Ferraro was too sensibly shocked at the dreadful state 
 of agitation, into which his simple observation had 
 thrown our heroine, to further press his inquiry at that 
 moment, and, however pained by her reserve, and deeply 
 interested to ascertain the nature of the connection be- 
 tween the object, he so deeply loved, and so dangerous a 
 character as he esteemed Father Dominick to be, he 
 still endeavoured to relieve her from her evident distress, 
 by giving a new direction to their discourse, as, in a tone 
 of badinage, he said — "I would, dearest, I were that 
 death." 
 
 " You ?" said Czerina, " fie, Antoine." 
 
 " And yet I would not," returned Ferraro ; " who 
 could wish so fair a creature's death ? — or who consent 
 to lose thee ? Lady, I should keep thee dying many, many 
 years." 
 
 " Have you the heart, Antoine V 
 
 " I'd do it in pity, sweet." 
 
 " How much stronger were pity then, than love ?"said 
 Czerina, with a melancholy smile, at the same time 
 brushing from her eyelid the glistening tear. " But talk 
 no more thus : if I had not almost forgot my grief to 
 listen." 
 
 " Princess !" cried Ferraro, " you know not how you 
 pain me — why in thine eyes inhabit such sad woes ? — 
 what hast thou to sorrow done ?" 
 
 " Oh, Antoine !" exclaimed Czerina, breaking forth into 
 accents of irrepressible anguish — " rather ask, what have 
 I done to him, whose gentleness is pain and doubt to me, 
 whose anxious care I feel, but cannot thank, for some 
 strange sentiment of reverential awe, — who, when he stabs 
 with dreadful words, which must be just, I think, yet 
 know not wherefore, health is a disease, and life abomi- 
 nable ? What have I done to him, whom yet I love, even

 as if that feeling sprang from every cause of bate and 
 terror?" 
 
 At these words the heart of Ferraro recoiled, as though 
 a burning coal had fallen on it. " Love," he repeated, in 
 a tone of agony, " and is that it? — thou dost trample 
 upon my heart, lady, which, at a word, I will lay bare 
 before thee." 
 
 " Good God ! Antoine !" cried Czerina. 
 
 Ferraro strode across the room. " There is no truth I" 
 he exclaimed, with bitterness, " in any thing we hear, or 
 feel, or look upon, for sight and sense are falser in them- 
 selves, than the flat perjury we overlook, in all that 
 seems beneath the sun." 
 
 " Ferraro ! — dear Ferraro !" ejaculated the queen. 
 
 The maddened lover traversed the apartment, without 
 heeding the endearing epithet. " Fortune, painted 
 blind, infers her fickleness, having no eyes to see on 
 whom she lavishes ; but, thou ! hadst thou been thus, 
 my heart had not been riven." Ferraro broke off. 
 
 " What have I done to thee, I ask ?" demanded Cze- 
 rina, seizing him by the hand. 
 
 " Nothing," he replied, with a cold and bitter smile, 
 " nothing, that doth deserve reproach ;" he paused, but, 
 presently, again starting into a phrenzy, exclaimed, 
 " Oh, cursed hopes ! that whisper into our hearts gay 
 things, yet mock the touch, as summer-boughs, which 
 coquet with the wind or any suitor, and whose light 
 leaves, that shadowed us in fancy, fail in the autumn of 
 reality ; whilst we, stripped of confiding thoughts, as- 
 sailed by the keen blasts of wonder at our blindness, re- 
 main our own contempt, naked, exposed in worse than 
 wintry bareness. Whom?" he added, grasping the 
 queen's hand fiercely, " whom do you love? — only tell 
 me, and I will show, how I have worshipped, and still 
 doat." 
 
 The tears coursed each other down the cheek of Cze-

 rina, as, in piteous accents, she repursued the train of 
 thought, the sudden appearance of her lover had inter- 
 rupted. 
 
 " You too ! — alas ! I have no friend in all the world, 
 Ferraro?— No." 
 
 " I never," proceeded Ferraro, without regarding, 
 in his jealous wrath, the anguish of the maiden, — " I 
 never told you that — never, how absolutely I was, and 
 am your slave ; but if you thought, when that I could 
 not mould my passion's form, I loved my dear fame better, 
 or my life, you wronged me, lady." 
 
 "Heavens! Ferraro!" cried the queen, in a more re- 
 served and indignant tone, — " provoke us not too much, 
 what can I have done, in contradiction of the waste of 
 thought I late bestowed on thee, but which now you 
 make me repent?" 
 
 " You said, even now, you loved," observed Ferraro 
 coldly. 
 
 " 1 said I loved!" cried, or rather shrieked Czerin a 
 " thou dost presume sir, — presume above our mercy, — 
 loved ! — whom did I say, I loved ?" 
 
 " Lady," replied Ferraro ; " thou didst not breathe his 
 name, which, when we truly love, is ever treasured too 
 deep in the fond heart, to be met wild upon the thought- 
 less lip." 
 
 " But what did I say ?" again shrieked Czerina. 
 
 "All madam," replied her jealous lover, "that the 
 passionately-loving feel." 
 
 " Ha ! can it be, I love him ?" she shrieked, " love — 
 what love? Oh, no, no, Marc Antoine ! — if I said 
 love, — Oh, that is monstrous ! — you have made me hate 
 the word — I could not be so false unto myself." 
 
 " So false to me, you mean," said Ferraro. 
 
 " Perhaps so, Antoine," replied the maiden. 
 
 " Do you confess as much?" 
 
 " And more," rejoined Czerina ; " when I said love, I 
 meant not that voluptuous melancholy, I feel at thoughts

 of thee, but something more awful, more serene, more 
 like what is due to Heaven. My yearning in his regard 
 sways my heart, as some religious instinct." 
 
 " In his regard ! — in whose ?" demanded Ferraro. 
 
 " My guardian's, sure," answered the queen. 
 
 " Martinuzzi ! — Oh, then indeed, — and yet," pro- 
 ceeded Ferraro, correcting himself, " thou shouldst not 
 love him ; for he, Czerina, would act the tyrant towards 
 his lawful sovereign, and sacrifice thy happiness, to prop 
 the tottering fabric of his own ambition." 
 
 " Alas !" cried Czerina, " I know it but too well." 
 
 " Then why dost yield to his authority, love?" said Fe- 
 rarro, in his most seductive accents. 
 
 " Why do I breathe ? — why did I first love you ? I 
 know no more, than that it is so, Antoine." 
 
 " And dost thou love me, Czerina?" 
 
 " Canst thou ask it ?" demanded, in turn, the con- 
 fiding maiden. " Would I, despite my clear thoughts for 
 defences, have exposed myself to hard construction, by 
 so often holding private parley with thee, if, with all my 
 heart, I did not love thee V* 
 
 The gaze, with which Ferraro met this avowal, was so 
 fixed and ardent, that Czerina lowered her own look to 
 the floor. 
 
 " Sure, if my mother," she rejoined, after a pause, 
 " Antoine, — if opportunity but sort, speak to my mother 
 of our attachment." 
 
 " Thy mother !" echoed Ferraro, involuntarily start- 
 ing, as if something horrid had occurred to his imagina- 
 tion. 
 
 "You seem troubled, Antoine. — Ay, my mother; she 
 never liked me ; but sure now, she'll stretch forth 
 her hand to save her daughter. Tell her, I'll die 
 a thousand deaths, sooner than wed the Richter 
 Iwan." 
 
 " The Richter Iwan," repeated Ferraro. 
 
 " Yes, Antoine, that man is to be the instrument of

 my torture; but, oh ! appeal to my mother: tell her, — 
 do I not hear a step ? — God ! if he should return, and find 
 you in this chamber, after having so solemnly proclaimed 
 his will to me !" 
 
 " Is it Father Dominick you speak of?" demanded 
 Ferraro eagerly. 
 
 Again the cheek of Czerina blanched to the hue of 
 death, as she replied, with an embarrassed air, and in a 
 broken and faltering tone of voice — " Yes — not — that is 
 
 he ! Father Dominick, said he would ;" she stopped 
 
 short — she could utter no more. 
 
 " Oh, Czerina!" exclaimed Ferraro, with emphatic 
 earnestness — " What horrid ties are those, which enthrall 
 thee in the mesh of so mysterious an individual, as is this 
 monk, with whom thou consortest ?" 
 
 "Mysterious indeed!" sighed Czerina, who, at the 
 observation of her lover, recurred in thought to the sad 
 night-mare of her childhood, — to that fatal remembrance, 
 which threw its bleak shade over her subsequent existence, 
 intercepting all sunshine from her heart — withering every 
 hope — darkening every prospect. 
 
 " Then, why submit to so sinister an influence, my 
 queen ?" continued the envoy, with considerable fervour. 
 " Why should the diadem of your father, stoop either to 
 the mitre or the cowl ? I am your faithful subject, — 
 loveliest of human beings ; I am likewise your chosen 
 knight, and in both, or either of those capacities, I im- 
 plore of you, to let me question this man of mystery on 
 his return, and insist on an explanation of his past pro- 
 ceedings, and his motives in insinuating himself into thy 
 confidence." 
 
 " Thou shalt do no such thing," cried Czerina, in a 
 voice of intense, but half stifled terror. " Antoine, thou 
 knowest not what thou dost propose ; thou dost dare, be- 
 yond playing with thunderbolts. Thou mightest as well 
 essay to direct the lightning in its track, as hope to 
 dictate to him. Thou mightest as easily prevail on in-

 exorable death to turn aside his shaft, as melt his icy 
 heart. Thou hadst better far exert thy voice to fright a 
 raging lion, than dare to set thyself in opposition to his 
 will." 
 
 " What you say, Czerina," returned Ferraro, " is as 
 an adamantine band round my desire, to strip the mask 
 from this chartered mystery. This being, twin-born of 
 night and horror — whose very name, whispered in the 
 streets of Hermanstadt, turns pale the bravest — at whose 
 presence men's hearts collapse — whom, thousands of my 
 countrymen would as lief embrace the eternal fiend, as 
 take by the hand in amity, with whom, notwithstanding, 
 they may be ignorantly holding frequent intercourse, 
 since what visage lurks under the drapery of this cowled 
 horror, none living knoweth. Men say, indeed, that that 
 sentry, whom many years ago. a villie enticed from his 
 post, beneath the precipice, beheld the father face to face, 
 in the vaults of Hermanstadt." 
 
 Not snow, new fallen from the chill skies, was whiter 
 or colder than the cheek of Czerina. 
 
 Ferraro, absorbed in one deep contemplation, noticed 
 not the sudden fading of her cheek. " That unfortunate 
 was slain ; and now his murderer weighs upon the breast 
 of Erdely, like some unutterable incubus. This should 
 not be, my princess. Whilst a stranger in the land, I had 
 neither warrant nor wish to interpose : now, however, I 
 have both ; — my station, and, from what I have this hour 
 witnessed, my anxiety for thy happiness. Oh, Czerina! 
 I adjure you, by all that is holy, for my sake, for your 
 own sake, to let me await the ghostly father's coming, 
 and unmask his devices." 
 
 " Would you have me die suddenly in thy sight, 
 Antoine?" cried the young queen, with a quivering 
 voice, as she trembled in an agony of apprehension. 
 
 " My princess !" returned Ferraro, soothingly. 
 
 " I ask, would you wish to stretch me, as by another 
 word thou wilt, a corpse at thy feet, Antoine Fer-

 raro ?" again demanded the excited maid, in a more pierc- 
 ing tone. 
 
 " Heavens ! Czerina, calm thyself, — how can you put it 
 thus ?" 
 
 " Antoine ! sir ! I would rather lay bare my bosom to 
 your dagger's point, than that you should persist in your 
 rash design. If you would not murder me upon the spot, 
 tell me, thou dost forego it — be speedy ;" she continued, 
 with a heightening colour, and an attitude of intense 
 attention, " for, even now, my heart beats high to his 
 firm tread along the corridor." 
 
 " Whose tread? the monk's?" demanded Ferraro, as 
 listening, his ears caught the sound of approaching steps. 
 
 Czerina uttered a feeble shriek, and turned her eyes on 
 her lover with the most intense supplication. " Answer 
 me," she cried, without making any reply to his previous 
 inquiry. " Dost thou abandon thy suicidal intent ?" 
 
 " Do you yourself know who, or what this man is, who 
 hoodwinks us with his cowl?" said Ferraro, evasively. 
 
 " I do, I do, I do," replied Czerina, with eager reitera- 
 tion, for now some person was evidently close at hand. 
 
 " And you have beheld him face to face?" persisted 
 Ferraro. 
 
 " Often, and often." 
 
 " And," recommenced Ferraro, — when what he was 
 about to add, was stopped short by Czerina, whose 
 haughty feelings, overcoming every other consideration, 
 prompted her to snatch away her hand, as she exclaimed : 
 
 " Antoine ! I will not answer you another syllable : 
 why will you put me to the question thus, and invent a 
 torture, the hangman never heard of? Demand the false 
 knave who led thee hither, whose visage, belike, is sym- 
 bolical of his heart. Go, rack thy friend, the African, not 
 me ; he knows all you'd ask, and more than that I 
 know, yet would most earnestly." 
 
 At that instant, a creaking sound arose, like the shoot-

 ing of a bolt, and the dark portrait seemed to tremble in 
 its frame. 
 
 " Antoine, he's here," said Czerina, in an hysterical 
 whisper, pressing her bloodless little hand upon his arm, 
 to enforce his acquiescence, — "Will you yet forego your 
 cruel purpose to my entreaty ? Heed my wish, as you 
 respect me!" 
 
 However, stimulated with a desire to expose what he 
 conceived the villany of the confessor, Ferraro, could 
 not be insensible to such wild and affecting appeals from 
 the being, whom he so truly idolized. He saw evidently, 
 from the state of trepidation and nervous excitement, 
 that to persist in his first intention, would be attended 
 with dangerous consequences. He, therefore, quickly 
 made answer — " Who could hold out against that charm ? 
 I, least of all — there, I yield my weak defences up, and 
 will not question him." 
 
 " Thank you, dearest," said Czerina, in a low hurried 
 voice, " affectionately pressing the hand of her lover in 
 one of hers, while with the other, she signed him to return 
 to the dark concealment, from whence he first appeared 
 to her." 
 
 Mutely replying to the fluttering dove-like index, by 
 obedience, Ferraro ensconced himself in the recess, and 
 the young queen was in the act of gliding from the 
 apartment, as the artificial portal flew open, and through 
 it issued the portentous figure of Father Dominick. He 
 descended to the floor, in the same breathing point of 
 time, that the nearly opposite door closed upon the fairy 
 shape of our heroine. 
 
 The monk advanced into the middle of the room, and 
 there halting, looked around him. Ferraro kept his eyes 
 fixed, with a feeling of thrilling curiosity, on every move- 
 ment of that mysterious man. " Ho ! ho !" he cried, in 
 a voice that, for some unknown cause, occasioned Fer- 
 raro a revulsion at the heart. He then walked, with 
 measured step, to the door, by which Czerina had just

 made her exit ; he opened it, looked without for a few 
 moments, then gently re-shut it, and, to Ferraro's in- 
 voluntary terror, approached the recess. Suddenly 
 stopping, the monk beckoned with his hand, and spake 
 in a deep, hollow tone, " Marc Antoine of Pereny," 
 he said, " come forth !" 
 
 Not, if a voice from the bottomless pit of hell, had given 
 out that solemn invocation, could Ferraro have been 
 more startled. His limbs, for an instant, refused their 
 functions, and then it was only by a resolute effort of 
 the will, that his mind triumphed. With composed 
 mien, and drawing himself up to his full height, he came 
 forward, in acknowledgment of the confessor's challenge. 
 Making a sudden halt, he stood, foot to foot, and front 
 to front, before his ghostly summoner. The monk was 
 silent. 
 
 " Holy father," said Ferraro, " I am he whom you 
 just named ; what would you with me V 
 
 " Follow my steps in silence," said the monk, turning 
 to depart. 
 
 " Whither wouldst thou lead me V inquired Fer- 
 raro. 
 
 Father Dominick walked straight to the door, through 
 which he and our heroine had first passed into the room. 
 There he paused, and, reverting his head, said, " I am 
 commissioned to conduct thee beyond the outer walls 
 of this palace." 
 
 " By whom commissioned ?" cried Ferraro, without 
 moving a single pace from the spot where he stood. 
 
 " By him, who brought thee hither," replied the 
 monk. 
 
 The involuntary start of Ferraro, and his bewildered 
 expression of countenance evidenced his astonishment ; 
 yet, still fearing he lay under some delusion, he coldly 
 rejoined, " It may be, holy father, as thou sayest ; but 
 what token dost thou bring me of thy truth herein ?" 
 
 " Demand any sign thou thinkest meet, either in the

 depth, or in the height above," responded the monk, 
 solemnly. 
 
 " Nay," rejoined Ferraro, doubtfully, " it is not for 
 me to ask, but for thee to establish the reality of thy 
 commission." 
 
 " Will it suffice for a warrant of my truth, if I repeat 
 to you the last words, which Scipio used, when he left 
 thee in this chamber ? Thus spoke the friend of Jerome 
 Lascus : — c Remain in this recess,' he said, ' until my 
 return, or, if I cannot do so conveniently, until the indi- 
 vidual, whom I shall appoint to guide you without the 
 palace walls, make his appearance.' Antoine Pereny, 
 I am that person." 
 
 It will easily be believed, that Ferraro's surprise was 
 extreme, at hearing, from the mouth of Father Dominick, 
 the very words the black had uttered. As he could not, 
 however, any longer pretend to question the monk's au- 
 thority, he briefly signified his readiness to attend him, 
 whithersoever it was his pleasure to proceed. 
 
 Immediately the monk cautiously opened the door, 
 on the lock of which, for the last minute, his hand had 
 rested. " Keep close by my side, Antoine," he said, 
 and stepped into the adjoining apartment. The envoy 
 of Austria followed. They threaded the intricacies of a 
 range of vacant chambers, which either issued into one 
 another, or were connected by short passages, without 
 lighting upon any one. One of these lobbies terminated 
 in a door, which opened on the landing-place of a mas- 
 sive flight of stone stairs, descending into a lofty hall or 
 vestibule, whence, as Ferraro was aware, from his pre- 
 vious acquaintance with the localities, there was an 
 outlet into the palace gardens. 
 
 On emerging through this door, they had to encounter 
 certain men-at-arms, and other retainers of the palace, 
 who were there in waiting. All shrunk back at Father 
 Dominick's appearance, and, in mute horror, they saw 
 him traverse, with measured pace, the distance to the

 topmost step, and then slowly disappear down the 
 staircase. 
 
 It happened, at that moment, probably owing to some 
 lover-like attributes of Ferraro, either absence of mind, 
 or his loitering, in the hope of being again blessed with 
 a glimpse of his mistress, that Father Dominick had got 
 considerably a-head of his companion, who scarcely pre- 
 sented his well-known person before the liveried group, 
 assembled on the landing-place, ere they sprang forward, 
 to bar his passage with their halberds. 
 
 " So, my gay 'NemetJ''* said one of his captors, glad 
 of an opportunity of giving vent to that bitter contempt 
 and antipathy to foreigners, which, from the era of our 
 story down to the present clay, makes the national cha- 
 racteristic ; " you will be for visiting the royal palace, 
 I trow, after Martinuzzi's orders contrariwise. I hope we 
 don't disarrange your furbelows ; but, by the rood of St. 
 Stephen ! you must to close quarters, till we inquire the 
 regent's commands as to the nature of your punish- 
 ment." 
 
 Ferraro darted on the speaker that maniac glance, and 
 withering frown, which, when he pleased, could stamp 
 his usual calm and handsome features, with an expres- 
 sion literally diabolical. He had already released his 
 one arm, and was yet struggling further for freedom, 
 when the monk, attracted by the hubbub, mounted the 
 stairs, and re-appeared in sight. 
 
 " Liberate him, knaves !" he exclaimed, in that voice 
 of horrid strength, — the expression of an authority which 
 was rarely disputed. Even with the utterance of this 
 command, his captors withdrew their gripe from Ferraro, 
 whom the confessor motioned to immediately descend, 
 and, the next instant, the two were seen to issue forth, 
 from the vestibule, into the garden. 
 
 " How mysterious the power and influence of this

 monk !" thought Ferraro, as he followed his guidance in 
 silence; " even in the royal palace, he has privilege of 
 entrance and of outgoing ; and there, no less than in the 
 meanest hovel in Hermanstadt, his mandate is instantly 
 obeyed ; and yet, not one of those, who acknowledge his 
 authority, as they never would that of the laws, has hi- 
 therto set eyes on the countenance, which lurks beneath 
 that cowl, save Czerina, — and she has often ! — hem! 
 — if the man means villanously, and that he doth, all 
 things concur to indicate, — I 'd sacrifice a moiety of 
 my existence, to resolve, one way or other, this racking 
 state of doubt; should I lose the present opportunity, 
 another may not speedily recur; I must be satisfied, — 
 but how ?" 
 
 The mental argument of Ferraro had proceeded to this 
 point, without break or pause, when, as he closed the 
 door of the vestibule, and stepped after the mysterious 
 confessor, beneath the dense and inclement skies, his 
 cogitations and further progress were at the same time 
 somewhat abruptly arrested, by the imposition of divers 
 pairs of hands upon his person, while his ears were simul- 
 taneously assailed, by all sorts of objurgation and re- 
 proach, in the German tongue. A single voice, however, 
 rose shrill and audible above the united clamour. 
 
 " He is one of the murderers," he cried ; " I thought, 
 we should secure him by encompassing the palace ; 
 seize upon him, and bring him before the Marquis of 
 Piadena." 
 
 Ferraro, on recovering from his surprise, saw himself 
 surrounded by more than a hundred Austrians ; his arms 
 were already pinioned. He looked on every side for 
 Father Dominick, but that mysterious person was no 
 where to be seen. Under these circumstances, he had 
 nothing for it, but to be borne along upon the stream of 
 events, which were beyond his control. 
 
 The Marquis of Piadena, late ambassador of Austria, 
 now prisoner of war, although suffered to remain at large

 within the walls of Hermanstadt, had taken up his quar- 
 ters in one of the mansions of the grand square. It was 
 thither, that Ferraro was hurried by his captors. Beneath 
 the jutting abutment of this house, the party were de- 
 tained for more than a minute, ere the door was opened. 
 It was during this interval, that Ferraro's attention was 
 attracted, by some one plucking him by the sleeve. He 
 turned his head. Again Father Dominick stood beside 
 him. 
 
 " Sift Baptista Castaldo closely," whispered the monk. 
 " Antoine, he is your father's enemy ; sift him closely." 
 
 " Thou mayest be the same, for aught that appears," 
 replied Ferraro, in the same low tone. " I ask not thy 
 counsel ; more, I doubt thy purpose." 
 
 "Learn what Castaldo is after ; and for me, doubt me, 
 boy, no longer." 
 
 Saying these words, the monk half raised his cloth. 
 Ferraro eagerly stooped his head, to catch a view of those 
 features which, at the moment of his seizure, he so burn- 
 ed to behold. He gazed, but instantly started back in 
 surprise, and his eyes seemed enlarged, and almost 
 turned to stone, as they encountered the Gorgonian 
 visage of Scipio, the black. The next minute he was 
 standing in the presence of Piadena.

 That King Ferdinand should meditate such a bloody 
 stroke of policy, presents a melancholy, though not sin- 
 gular instance of human depravity ; but for him to reduce 
 his machinations to the form of a state paper, * exhibits 
 a disregard of shame and infamy, which we are inclined 
 to hope, for the honour of our nature, is rarely to be 
 paralleled, even among assassins. From the moment 
 that measures were taken, to realise so iniquitous a con- 
 ception, not only was every principle of morality lost 
 sight of, or contemned, but the fair structure of inter- 
 national law, which, at the period of our tale, was begin- 
 ning to disclose itself to the eye of Europe, amid receding 
 cloud and vapour, must have been shaken to its centre. 
 
 The Marquis of Piadena, after hearing the accusation 
 preferred against Ferraro, of his having been concerned, 
 with other villains, in the murder of one of his excel- 
 lency's immediate retainers, directed the apartment to be 
 cleared of every soul, but the accused. 
 
 <c Now, Marc Antoine," he said to his secretary, as 
 soon as his orders were obeyed, " what is the truth of 
 this matter ?" 
 
 Ferraro explained the nature of his captor's misappre- 
 hension. 
 
 Castaldo knit his brows. " What devil put it in thy 
 head to interpose," he said, " between a criminal and 
 the orders of thy government V 
 
 " A criminal — my government !" repeated Ferraro, in- 
 voluntarily. 
 
 "To be sure — thy government," said Castaldo. "What 
 ails thee, sir ? Understand, there are three men, now in 
 this city, rank rebels to the lawful authority of the arch- 
 duke."

 " Lawful authority !" echoed the secretary. 
 
 " By the life of the emperor ! Ferraro, thou art 
 strangely dull o' the sudden. Is not our royal master 
 king of Hungary ?" 
 
 The mind of the Austrian envoy was, indeed, sadly 
 bewildered by the conflict of duties, which his peculiar 
 situation involved, and not knowing exactly in what way 
 he ought to shape his reply, he preserved silence. 
 
 " One of these traitors," continued Castaldo, after 
 pausing for an instant, " is that damned Per — , I would 
 say, is the black — Scipio, I think they call him — the 
 same whose life thou heedlessly savedst." 
 
 A curdling sensation crept through the veins of Fer- 
 raro, which with difficulty he prevented himself from 
 betraying. 
 
 " The other is one, who has too long been suffered to 
 make this land one vast theatre of dread and mystifica- 
 tion : — the ghost of Father Dominick may walk the 
 vaults of Hermanstadt, if such be its spiritual taste ; but 
 his body shall henceforth lie where priests tell us, the 
 ' wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at 
 rest,' — in the dark restriction of the tomb." 
 
 Ferraro, though every moment more startled, was 
 prompted, by several concurrent causes, to put such a 
 curb over his feelings, as to preclude the possibility of 
 Castaldo penetrating his real sentiments ; he recalled the 
 solemn bidding of the monk, as he entered the house, — 
 " He is your father's enemy, sift him to the core." 
 
 Therefore, on Castaldo again pausing for a reply, his 
 secretary, after a minute's consideration, rendered it by 
 saying — 
 
 " You named another traitor, my lord, if I mistook 
 not ; may I inquire, who is to follow in the wake of this 
 bloody jubilee ?" 
 
 " Undoubtedly you may, Ferraro," replied Castaldo; 
 '* and the rather, that I intend you the honour of serving 
 your country, by closing his career.

 "Serving my country!" thought Ferraro, as the mar- 
 quis hesitated, ere he added — 
 
 " He, who will make the third in the triumvirate of 
 death, is Cardinal Martinuzzi." 
 
 Ferraro, however irritated of late at certain proceed- 
 ings of Martinuzzi,. .his harsh treatment of Czerina, — 
 his preventing all personal communication between the 
 lovers, — his determination to bestow the queen of Hun- 
 gary on some fautorer of his own, — the mode, where in- 
 sult aggravated injury, in which, since Martinuzzi's re- 
 turn to Hermanstadt, the envoy had been denied admis- 
 sion to the palace ; — however exasperated from these 
 various causes, Ferraro felt not a little indignant, at the 
 heartless perfidy of the court of Vienna. Still, with 
 whatever difficulty, he controlled his temper, and pre- 
 served silence. 
 
 " It is the intention of Ferdinand," presently observed 
 the marquis, to bestow the hand of the puppet queen, 
 mewed up in yon palace, on some private gentleman, 
 born in his Austrian dominions, by which means, he will 
 bar all claim of her descendants to the throne. The 
 royal maid is left to my disposal, and, but that these mes- 
 sengers of time," he continued, laying his hand upon his 
 head, " admonish me to be wary, I would wed her my- 
 self. That being, however, out of the question, I propose 
 transferring my right to the man, who shall rid her of her 
 chiefest enemy and tyrant, — this overgrown cardinal." — 
 Ferraro started. "Now, Antoine," he continued: "I 
 have a regard for you, because you came to me, recom- 
 mended by a man, I have long held in reverence, the 
 good old Jerome Lascus, with whose house I once, — but 
 that is foreign to the purpose. I understand, moreover, 
 you have conceived an attachment to the Lady Czerina. 
 Prithee, no blushing, — 'tis well, — 'tis very well, — 'tis an 
 additional incentive." 
 
 " Incentive," exclaimed Ferraro, unable any longer

 MANUSCRIPT XXV. 125 
 
 to restrain himself; " Good God ! my lord, what do you 
 mean V 
 
 " Mean, Marc Antoine," replied Castaldo, in a slow 
 and determined tone of voice; "mean! — why, that as 
 surely, as that you and I now breathe, Martinuzzi will be 
 silenced, and the man who does the deed, shall wed the 
 daughter of the last king of Hungary. Nay, never start, 
 and look concerned, and purse thy brows. Ferdinand's 
 word is irreversible ; I have it pledged, and thou art he, 
 whom I have pitched upon, to do the state this service ; 
 and what is more, an thou likest the wench, this pleasure 
 to thyself." 
 
 " My lord," answered Ferraro ; " I can settle the 
 point by a word, at once and for ever, — it can never be." 
 
 " Antoine, — Marc Antoine," said the marquis, " by 
 your leave, I will dismiss you, and the subject of our 
 present conference together. Another time, and we'll 
 re-discuss it, — I am now engaged, — silence : make no 
 rash vows, — the matter is not immediately urgent. You 
 can reflect upon the alternative. The maid in your 
 arms, and wealth in your coffers : or the maid in the 
 arms of some more daring, and less scrupulous young 
 gentleman. I have my eye on many now in Herman- 
 stadt, would sell their souls for a dinner, leave alone a 
 bedfellow. Or the maid, I say, in the arms of some don 
 or signor, and your purse never the heavier. You may 
 make your choice. No word, sir. "What, ho! who waits? 
 My secretary," he continued to those who now entered 
 the apartment; " has satisfied me of his innocence, in that 
 matter, you charged him with erewhiles, — let him go 
 free. Good den, Ferraro, — wait upon me, at midnight. 
 If you fail me," he added, in a lower tone ; " I shall em- 
 ploy some one of my captive retinue, who better under- 
 stands his interest. At midnight; and by all means gather 
 wisdom in the interim. Bring with thee, thy acquiescence 
 in writing to act according to my wish, in return for which.

 thou shalt receive, under my hand and seal, the cove- 
 nant of our government, to help thee to the hand of this 
 royal maiden. Enough ; at midnight I shall expect you." 
 And with these words, delivered in atone, which implied, 
 that no reply would be received, the panic-stricken 
 Ferraro was literally bowed out of the chamber. 
 
 In a state of feverish excitement, with burning brow, 
 and a mind almost distraught, by a variety of vague and 
 conflicting images, Ferraro rushed from the abode of his 
 late lord and patron. The callous, calculating cold- 
 bloodedness, with which the marquis, in ignorance of his 
 secretary's newly discovered rank and parentage, dis- 
 closed his infamous project, and proposed to him the 
 perpetration of so vile an action, as the assassination of 
 the regent, horrified every faculty of his soul. Inflamed 
 from patriotic motives, with rage and indignation against 
 Ferdinand and his minister, while no less, as a man, 
 his nature was revolted, by their treacherous and san- 
 guinary machinations, Ferraro's brain for the next half 
 hour after he left the presence of Castaldo, reeled with 
 the influx of bewildering thoughts, till reason well nigh 
 tottered on her throne. How was he to act? By what 
 procedure could he most surely blast so murderous an 
 intent? Martinuzzi's life, he knew, was safe for the pre- 
 sent, because Piadena had stated, that he would not 
 move in the matter, till after he received his secretary's 
 answer, — but the African. Even now Ferraro trembled, 
 lest his friend might be falling beneath the assassin's 
 steel; and not until to-morrow midnight, at which time, 
 Scipio had promised to introduce him to his father, 
 would he have an opportunity of warning him of his 
 danger. Then suddenly, the thought crossed his mind, 
 that, that Scipio, whom he had been instructed to regard, 
 with almost filial reverence, was no other than Father 
 Dominick himself; and the thrilling dismay, with which 
 Ferraro recalled the fact, was hardly inferior to that, 
 which overcame him, when he first peered beneath the

 MANUSCRIPT XXVIII. 127 
 
 drooping cowl of the incomprehensible confessor. In 
 every way, horror encompassed the unhappy Ferraro. 
 
 If Martinuzzi were slain, by the agent of Castaldo, that 
 agent was to be requited, by the hand of Czerina. If 
 the cardinal survived, he was bent on bestowing the 
 peerless daughter of John Zapola, on one of his own 
 creatures. 
 
 Harassed by such reflections, and maddened by 
 evil suggestions of his own violent and passionate nature, 
 Ferraro wandered awhile, he knew not whither — a des- 
 perate horror seemed to lock up his faculties, when, 
 happening for an instant to recollect himself, he per- 
 ceived, that he stood beneath the ruinous porchway, where 
 he and Scipio had taken shelter, during that interest- 
 ing conference, which preceded such a variety of incidents. 
 Instantaneously, a new idea struck the excited mind of 
 Ferraro — his sole gleam of comfort arose from the mys- 
 terious powers, which Father Dominick undoubtedly 
 possessed, and he resolved at all risks, to seek an interview 
 with the confessor, by means of the secret passage. As 
 he revolved over in his thoughts the various hazards, 
 incident to his suddenly conceived project, and the pro- 
 bability that, after all, they would be run to no purpose, 
 his hands groped about the ground, in hopes of discover- 
 ing the artifice of the trap-door. It was after a tedious 
 research, and, just as he began to despair of accomplish- 
 ing his task, that, by the merest accident, he ascertained 
 the nature of the mechanism, and, being equally success- 
 ful with the secret spring of the door, which terminated the 
 passage, he found himself again, in that lofty chamber, 
 where, not long before, he had held discourse with Czerina. 
 It was unoccupied. Ferraro crossed over to the portrait, 
 and having easily caused it to revolve on its hinges, he 
 passed into a sort of corridor. This went on apparently 
 for the whole length of the building : it contained a single 
 window on one side, and at the extremity, were two 
 opposite doors, corresponding with one another. Thither

 Ferraro bent his steps, and, after pausing for a single 
 second, opened, at hazard, that to his right. He looked 
 within, and would have precipitately retreated, on rinding, 
 he had unwittingly intruded, upon the sacred precincts of 
 a lady's dressing-room. The style of the furniture, and 
 of all that his eyes lit upon, was a fine comment on the 
 sentiment of the courtezan, in a play of Plautus : 
 " Munditia illecebra animo est amanUim."* 
 
 Odoriferous and rare exotic plants, arranged on stands, 
 or placed in Etruscan vases, diffused their grateful per- 
 fume deliciously around. The floor was covered with 
 Herat carpeting ; the walls were hung with pink silk, 
 drawn up in graceful festoons ; a few costly tomes, 
 mingled with instruments of music, were spread out upon 
 the side table ; other articles of a miscellaneous charac- 
 ter, in requisition with the fair sex, lay about indifferently. 
 " Vanities of tires"f — (" spectacle de volupte !")J 
 " Les vestes and les broderies, et les toiles si deliees, ces 
 vaines couverturesqui ne cachent rien,"§ — were carefully 
 disposed, or negligently laid aside on the several elegant 
 couches and embroidered sofa seats, which corresponded 
 with the hangings, and with which, as with other com- 
 fortable accommodations, and accessaries of luxury, the 
 apartment abounded. Ferraro, was in the act of with- 
 drawing as gently as possible, when a low and thrilling 
 voice stole upon his ear. Oh, how his heart bounded in 
 his bosom ! he would have rushed from the spot, but 
 some spell seemed to nail him where he stood. 
 
 "Who is there?" said the fair interrogator. " Is't 
 Clarinda ? — Gertrude ? — speak." Receiving no answer, 
 the genius loci — the divinity of that Circean chamber, 
 uprising from her seat, on a pile of cushions at the farther 
 end of the salon, with slow and majestic carriage, 
 advanced to the door, and flung it open. No sooner,

 however, did she cast her eyes on him, who, having doffed 
 his glittering cap, stood trembling at the entrance, than 
 without taking a second glance, her whole frame shook 
 with an electrical sensation, and uttering a piercing ex- 
 clamation, she staggered back several paces. 
 
 It would, in truth, be hard to say, whether the agita- 
 tion of Ferraro, or that of Isabella, for the following 
 minute, were the more excessive. The lady, however, 
 was the first to assert the mind's sovereignty, and re-assume 
 her wonted command over her feelings, — still it was with 
 a failing voice, and embarrassed air, that she broke the 
 thrilling silence. 
 
 " Marc Antoine Ferraro," she said, "Thou there? 
 this is an honour, which, — but really,— to what miracle 
 are we indebted for your visit ?," 
 
 " Ferraro returned some broken and hurried reply, in 
 which the words, "pardon," and " unintentional obtru- 
 sion," were all that were intelligible. 
 
 " Unintentional, sir! — oh, of course," returned the queen, 
 with bitterness. " Our acts, nay, our lightest words are 
 so many additional threads, fearfully interwoven, through- 
 out that web of destiny, in which our every movement is 
 entangled. Unintentional! Can mortality reach the ob- 
 ject of fate, or if so, resist his will ? Oh, sir, never doubt, 
 this dung of earth hath order in it, though it looks one 
 vast phantasma, and the life, which it inherits but an idle 
 dream, or else — but it suffices, thou art here to my wish 
 — although i' faith," she added, with a smile, that played 
 over the surface of her pale cheek, like moonshine on 
 some monumental alabaster, cold and uncherishing, — 
 " i' faith, thou must walk in thy sleep, Ferraro, or where- 
 fore art thou here ?" She paused, and then continued in 
 a lower tone, " Can circumstance thus leap to our em- 
 brace, and the devil conjure, with a thought? My soul ! it 
 is a fearful apprehension that !" 
 
 Again Isabella broke off, muttering to herself, as if 
 mentally debating some inscrutable, and doubtful point.

 Ferraro felt his situation every moment becoming more 
 and more embarrassing. A cold damp stood on his 
 forehead, and, in doubt and hesitation, he continued 
 silent. 
 
 " Ferraro," said Isabella, after deeply ruminating for 
 more than a minute, " prithee, enter, — be not afeard. 
 I am indebted to that invisible and omnipotent power, 
 that led thee hither, without thine own volition, for an 
 opportunity, which I were an ingrate to let escape ; — 
 enter, Ferraro." 
 
 " An opportunity," thought Ferraro, with an involun- 
 tary start, as he sent his sight around the magnificently 
 furnished apartment, — " for what, in Heaven's name?" 
 
 " Art thou grown into a statue, sir, since — what 
 dost view in my chamber, that so absorbest thy vision ? 
 Antoine, stand not, with the door ajar, but enter, and 
 I will show thee all its rarities." 
 
 It is probable, that Ferraro would have exhibited, at 
 once, an equal deficiency in policy and politesse, by 
 declining Isabella's somewhat startling invitation, if he 
 had not recollected, that it was Czerina's wish, he should 
 implore her mother to interpose, between her and the 
 threatened tyranny of her guardian. Therefore, in obe- 
 dience to the directions of Isabella, he stepped into her 
 apartment, and closed the door. Even in the instant, he 
 almost repented the facility of his acquiescence, not a 
 little startled to -observe the queen approach the door, 
 and shoot a small bolt into its fastening, and then cross 
 the apartment to an inner entrance, to secure that in 
 like manner. 
 
 " We must not risk being interrupted," she remarked, 
 with a half smile ; " but rest thee, Antoine ;" and the 
 queen, motioning him, to seat himself beside her, extended 
 her graceful form in luxurious ease, upon an ottoman. 
 
 The heart of Ferraro, as he suffered himself to sink 
 mechanically upon the cushion, misgave him. Never ; 
 not even in the vernal development of her charms,

 did Queen Isabella look more enchantingly beautiful, 
 than at that moment. The low couch, on which she 
 partly seated, partly reposed herself, in that half with- 
 drawn, that semi-reducta* attitude, which the poet attri- 
 butes to Venus herself, was posited under a lofty and 
 heraldic casement, whose stained and diamonded panes 
 blushed, with blood of kings. Such a medium admitted 
 only a subdued light, and tempered the glare of day, into 
 a most dim, rosy mist, which, like a vaporous ruby, per- 
 vaded the apartment. 
 
 The lineaments of Isabella's countenance, finished with 
 such exquisite regularity, were consequently thrown into 
 that soft and mellowing shadow, so agreeable to the 
 meridian character of her beauty, and so grateful to the 
 imagination of the beholder. Her loosened pourpoint, — 
 she was divested of her exterior robe of crimson velvet, 
 having been interrupted in the middle of her toilet opera- 
 tion, — disclosed the fine proportions of those glow- 
 ing charms, it was meant to hide, and looked, to use 
 the words of Leigh Hunt, on a picture of Lely, as if the 
 artist had said, " Only stop a moment, my dear, before 
 you finish your dressing, and I will take you in that atti- 
 tude." The exquisite grace of her half- reclining pos- 
 ture, which set off the sinuous symmetry of her figure, 
 and displayed the contour of every lovely limb, — the 
 breathless voluptuousness of her countenance, half- up- 
 raised, — the tremulous curve of her ripe coral lip, — the full 
 and rounded throat, flowing, with curvilinear beauty, into 
 the perfect bust and polished shoulders, from whence the 
 retiring edges of fine lace fell carelessly away, leaving 
 the delicate treasure beneath exposed to the eye, in 
 ravishing glimpses, each more precious, if not costly, 
 than those priceless pearls, her loveliness was wont to 
 adorn, and which now beamed refulgent, from an open 
 trinket-case, on a near table, — the heaving of her chest,

 evincing the deep and tumultuous thoughts, that surged 
 within, — the snow-white and taper fingers, on which her 
 cheek leaned, contrasting with the dishevelled richness 
 of her raven tresses, where the warm gules, from the 
 scutcheoned casement, lighted, like a glory, — the soft 
 and sleepy air, which her long, dark lashes, drooping 
 over her swimming eyes, gave to her countenance, — the 
 delicate little feet and ancles, consciously betrayed, and 
 unconsciously twinkling, in the excitement of the mo- 
 ment, — all combined to form a portrait of such en- 
 trancing effect, that never (did one credit the doctrine 
 of metempsychosis) could poetry conceive a more meet 
 tenement, to lodge the migrating spirit of a Cleopatra, or 
 an Aspasia. 
 
 " Sic Venus optaret mortalibus ipsa videri."* 
 
 The moment was critical, and became the more dan- 
 gerous, on account of those accessories of loveliness, and 
 appliances to luxury, with which the apartment teemed ; 
 so that Ferraro, as his eyes glanced over that incom- 
 parable profile, half turned in silent thoughtfulness from 
 his observation, could only internally pray, that the be- 
 witching being before him, did not propose any trial of 
 his constancy and firmness. 
 
 " Aid me, virtue, or I am lost !" he thought to him- 
 self, as he sat and gazed, and felt his constancy " oozing 
 away," like the valour of Bob Acres, " at his fingers' 
 ends." 
 
 The contemplation of the syren obliterated, for awhile, 
 every other impression on his heart. He turned away 
 his eyes, and, fixing them upon the ground, sighed in- 
 voluntarily. 
 
 It was after a long and embarrassing pause, that 
 Isabella resumed the conversation. Drawing a rich 
 wimple more closely over the round, full beauty, of her 
 neck and bosom, she turned to Ferraro, and said, with

 a soft smile, " Well, Antoine, though I can hardly 
 persuade myself, that my beholding you be not an illu- 
 sion of my senses, I will not ask, by what conjuration 
 thou hast obtained admission into the palace, I confine 
 myself to a single inquiry ; — tell me, what motive had 
 you, in seeking an interview ?" 
 
 Ferraro hesitated, ere he ventured any reply, for the 
 thought suddenly struck him, that it would be as well, 
 to leave Isabella in her present persuasion, of his having 
 intentionally obtruded on her privacy. Remembering 
 our heroine's wish, he immediately proceeded, in pa- 
 thetic terms, to dilate on the agony of Czerina, at the 
 contemplated sacrifice of her hand to the Richter I wan. 
 He then pleaded the truth of his own passion, and, in 
 conclusion, carried away by his feelings, adjured Isa- 
 bella, by all she held dear on earth, to interpose her 
 authority, to avert the threatened union. 
 
 The royal lady heard him to a close, in silence, and, 
 save by a slight quivering of the nether lip, that abruptly 
 paled its previous coral hue, and by the colour, that 
 overspread and faded on her cheek, and then re-rose with 
 a fitful rapidity, she gave no perceptible token of interest 
 in the relation. When he had done, however, she briefly 
 observed, in a low tone, while a faint, and sickly smile 
 played about her mouth, " In truth, Antoine, I never 
 met a braver man than thou art, — that thou shouldst tell 
 me this ?" 
 
 " What have I told V returned Ferraro, involun- 
 tarily. 
 
 A dangerous expression mantled the brow of Isabella. 
 She raised her eyes ; those of Antoine sunk beneath the 
 encounter. " What told? — what told ?" she cried, in 
 a voice, whose tone, although evidently suppressed, 
 sounded thrillingly loud, on the ear of Ferraro, — " what 
 told? — tome? nay, tis rank ! — why, sir," she paused, 
 biting her lip, and then, in a milder key, she added, 
 " nothing at all, — just nothing."

 " Madam," said Ferraro, " what mean you ? I 
 thought " 
 
 " Marc Antoine Ferraro/' interrupted Isabella, with 
 peculiar dignity and animation, " let there be no mis- 
 take in this. I dream not of the past, and am, besides, 
 of better temper, than to cure my honour with any strange 
 revenge; yet, troth, I have heard tell of women, who — 
 yea, have seen some such — and do myself believe, it 
 were more wise of you to start the sleeping panther, and 
 stare into her eye, than do such things ; but I repeat, 
 though I were other than what I am, you would not 
 nettle me, — not, sir, a whit, — I harbour no malice." 
 
 " Indeed, your grace," replied Ferraro, " it was your 
 daughter's will, I should implore your protection for 
 her ; — she did command me, on my love, to speak to 
 you." 
 
 " Yes, yes, I know," returned Isabella, impatiently. 
 " The theme slides from your tongue ; you've spoken it 
 before. She is proud, and boasts she will not wed the 
 Richter Iwan, and she grows eloquent, and — how else 
 was it ? let me hear." 
 
 Ferraro was recommencing some appeal to the mater- 
 nal feelings of Isabella, when the queen again spoke. 
 
 " There — enough — sure I know, what you would say; 
 but what can I do? It is the regent's match ; — I have 
 no voice in't." 
 
 " Insist, madam, that it shall not be," answered 
 Ferraro. 
 
 "Insist!" echoed Isabella, scornfully. "How idle! 
 That man, sir, will not be argued with; — remonstrance 
 cannot reach his pinnacle of greatness." 
 
 " Is he so high ? He may be nearer blasting," said Fer- 
 raro, in a low, meaning voice. 
 
 " Thou dost not say amiss," returned Isabella, signi- 
 ficantly. " But prithee, Antoine, be not moved. If Mar- 
 tinuzzi wills it, the Richter weds my daughter."

 "He shall not!" exclaimed Ferraro, passionately. 
 " I know one way, at least ; be assured, he shall not." 
 
 " Indeed !" said Isabella, with an almost impercep- 
 tible sneer. " What would you do ? Build your own 
 tomb, and run into it living?" 
 
 "No, I will die!" said Ferraro, with strong emo- 
 tion. 
 
 "Like a child, i' the sulks," returned Isabella; "or 
 woman, whose will is thwarted ; or, meaner still, a slave — 
 a slave, Ferraro, restive in his bonds — that fears his 
 master. Die, like a dog ! For shame ! A man like you, 
 to let his passion betray his reason thus ! Is not this 
 valiant now ? Will thy death prevent my daughter's mar- 
 riage ? If Martinuzzi have determined upon the match, 
 theRichter weds her, sir, whether you live or die." 
 
 " Oh God !" cried Ferraro. 
 
 " I see no help, Antoine," continued Isabella, with a 
 sigh, moving insidiously nearer to him, as she spoke, and 
 letting her soft hand light gently upon his. "Alas! 
 there is none — on earth — if Heaven, indeed — but prayers 
 are beaten back, and hell must dower her votaries with 
 
 impassiveness — or, long ago . No, dear Antoine, 
 
 Czerina must obey." 
 
 Ferraro seized hold of the little hand, the mute en- 
 closure of whose ivory fingers in return, thrilled through 
 his whole frame. The soft pressure implied a meaning, 
 that no eloquence could do justice to — 
 
 " Ne'er magician's wand, 
 Wrought change, with all Aimida's fairy art, 
 Like what this light touch left upon his heart." * 
 
 It was with trembling accents, he spoke, looking earnestly 
 into Isabella's face. 
 
 " You say, if Heaven, — and can then Heaven ? Dear 
 madam, tell me." 
 
 * Don Juan.

 " Did you not, awhile ago, speak of blasting, Antoine ? 
 But no, it ought not to be hoped for. The Heavens, 
 dear sir, at times, show like the Cyclops ; and the sub- 
 tlest slave may laugh at vengeance." 
 
 " Thou art an oracle," said Ferraro, for the first time 
 fixing his own eagle eyes on those bright orbs of Isabella, 
 whence flew the sparkles forth, like Cupid's arrows ; 
 " and dost mean something, — interpret for me ? I know 
 no subtle slave : — whom dost point at ?" 
 
 "The Heavens, Antoine, we are told," replied Isa- 
 bella, throwing her right bare arm carelessly over his 
 shoulder ; while, approaching still closer, she lifted up 
 her face till her lips, and those of Ferraro, almost met, — 
 " can choke the breath they gave ; — or else shine out to 
 deplume ambition's wings. Have you not heard of some 
 such matter? But he, whose name I loathe, strides o'er 
 the prostrate land, and reigns, and soars, and lives, in fate's 
 despite, — and will for ever, as I think. Heaven ! — Hea- 
 ven is struck blind, and rayless ; and thou, and all men 
 living, are tame as dirt !" 
 
 Ferraro was silent for a few moments, — his eyes dwelt 
 upon vacancy. " Oh !" at last he murmured to himself, 
 " I am very wretched !" 
 
 "To thy shame, Antoine," said Isabella; " there's no 
 man need be miserable, save him, that makes himself so — 
 but thou art faint, and turnest pale. What is it aileth 
 thee ?" 
 
 Ferraro, in silent anguish, disengaged his hand, and 
 rising from the soft couch, paced the chamber, with a 
 rapid, but an irregular step. Isabella followed him. He 
 leant against the door for support. Isabella leaned over 
 him. 
 
 Contending passions had tugged at the heart of Fer- 
 raro, unintermittingly, for many preceding hours, during 
 which interval, the vis animi had not been sustained 
 by any bodily aid and refreshment; — he felt his brain, in 
 sympathy with his heart, heated and feverish; — his throat

 was parched — his powers of sufferance seemed, to him- 
 self, quite worn out. 
 
 "Antoine," said Isabella, "be more a man, if thou 
 wouldst not, that Martinuzzi trench his power in thine, 
 and Czerina's, peace. Bethink thee." She paused, 
 and then added, in a low tone, that thrilled upon every 
 nerve ; " Is there no way ?" 
 
 Some faltering- reply was on the lip of Ferraro, when 
 their eyes met for a moment, and his voice grew so weak, 
 that the faint murmur he breathed forth, was scarce dis- 
 tinguishable from silence. A peculiar smile played upon 
 the features of Isabella, and she fixed him by a look, so 
 mysterious and terrible, that Ferraro, instinctively, trem- 
 bled, and presently turned away his head, with a sensa- 
 tion of horror. 
 
 " My God ! how thy hands burn, Antoine," said the 
 queen. 
 
 "To my touch, so do thine," replied Ferraro ; " but, 
 in truth, I have a craving thirst." 
 
 Isabella moved towards a canopied recess, beneath 
 which was a sort of buffet, appropriated to liqueurs, con- 
 serves, &c. It was manufactured of some curious wood, 
 ingrained with marble, and supported by four figures of 
 Cupid, from the antique. At that spot, with her back to 
 Ferraro, she remained for several moments, and then 
 returned, bearing a massive silver cup, crowned to the 
 brim, with some sparkling liquor. 
 
 " Drink, dear Antoine," said the lady; " 'twill revive 
 thy flagging spirit." 
 
 Ferraro took the proffered libation, forgetful of all else, 
 but how he might best allay the heat and fever in his 
 blood, he raised the grateful liquid to his lips. 
 
 u Gracious madam," he cried, " may all thy wishes 
 ever meet a quick fulfilment, even as mine do now." 
 Saying these words, the rash youth took a deep and de- 
 licious draught. Another — and then Ferraro placed the 
 empty goblet on a table, that stood convenient.

 The day, throughout, had been dark and tempestuous, 
 and now the shades of twilight deepened, more and more, 
 till the countenances of Ferraro, and Queen Isabella, as 
 they sat, side by side, on the low couch, were gradually 
 veiled from each other, in the increasing gloom. A 
 raging torrent, boiled in the veins of Ferraro ; — he attri- 
 buted it to the vinous juice, acting on an excited mind, 
 and enfeebled frame, little imagining that other, and 
 more stimulating ingredients, were mingled in that potent 
 concoction, he had incautiously quaffed. Wrapt about 
 in the dangerous obscurity of the hour, a hushed stillness 
 pervading the apartment, that deepened, at intervals, 
 by contrast with the roaring of the gusty wind without, 
 and solitude, insinuating into the passionate heart her 
 mystic language, Isabella sat with Ferraro. 
 
 Human infirmity was incident to the Austrian envoy, 
 as to every other man. We do not undertake to de- 
 scribe " a faultless monster that the world ne'er saw." 
 Even in breasts where religion and morality hold far 
 greater influence, than ever they possessed, over that of 
 Ferraro, religion and morals must have been alike extin- 
 guished, before the delirious excitement of that hour, if 
 prudence had not provided a mithridate, against the dan- 
 gerous temptation. In this conservative and cardinal 
 virtue, Ferraro was deficient; though, indeed, had he 
 been ever so wary, he might hardly have suspected Isa- 
 bella's purpose. From the moment, however, that he 
 drained the intoxicating cup, which she presented him, 
 his guardian angel seemed to have flown. That inclina- 
 tion for Isabella, which he had believed inurned for ever, 
 re-rose, in all its original excess, and burst through those 
 cerements, which honour, pure love for another, and tem- 
 porary estrangement, had wrapped about the buried pas- 
 sion. With his renewed attachment, the long-sealed 
 fountains of his heart were opened afresh ; and while his 
 whole frame seemed composed of a single nerve, his 
 tongue ran on, in a golden strain of poetry, which, as it

 owed much to the fervour of delivery, much to the soft 
 magic of his voice, and perhaps not a little to grace of 
 action, we despair, by any effort of ours, to convey to the 
 reader. 
 
 Dusky twilight rapidly darkened into night, and as 
 their persons drew nearer, their hearts (at least so Fer- 
 raro deemed) seemed the more closely to re-unite. Still, 
 with that inconsistency, which he alone can reconcile, to 
 whom the secret and latent springs and workings of the 
 human mind are no secret, Ferraro, even in this reeling 
 of his senses, would recur to the object of his interview, 
 and reiterate his petition to Isabella, to interpose between 
 Czerina, and the tyrannous design of Martinuzzi. 
 
 " I am but- a weak woman, dear Antoine," said the 
 lady, in reply to one of these entreaties, preferred with 
 increasing earnestness. " So long as the man, we speak of, 
 sways my daughter's sceptre, he'd sweep away any ob- 
 stacle of mine, like chaff, before the whirlwind of his 
 authority. As I told you, awhile ago, I can descry no 
 hope, while it suits Heaven to smile upon his treasons. 
 Why, the man is still in the prime of life, Ferraro, and 
 all, who wither beneath his pestilent shade, shrink, it 
 seems to me, into idiotism, or else lack gall and manhood. 
 No, there's no reprieve — none.'* 
 
 " The thought thy words suggest, runs through me, 
 like a fever," cried Ferraro. " God ! what a buzzing a 
 here : feel, dear Isabella !" 
 
 The tender epithet caused the nerves of the queen to 
 thrill. She breathed hard, but one single suspiration, 
 that escaped, in spite of herself, from her panting bosom, 
 was louder than her breathing. Ferraro took her hand, 
 and placed it on his forehead. 
 
 "It throbs, indeed, my love," said Isabella, and the 
 tones of her voice were subdued, nearly to a whisper. 
 " Let me press it for you — lean on me." 
 
 They drew still nearer, and in the gradation of their

 mutual forgetfulness, Ferraro declined his head on the 
 bosom of Isabella. 
 
 " I never thought." said Isabella, in a murmur, as low 
 as it was tremulous, " to clasp again the one sole thing in 
 all this world I deigned to covet. Oh ! it is sweet, An- 
 toine I" 
 
 Stooping, she imprinted a kiss — no, not a kiss — but 
 a long, long pressure of her lips, far more significant of 
 affection, on that flushed cheek, the uppermost ; the 
 other nestled voluptuously on love's own pillow. 
 
 O ! ces baisers qu'une voluptueuse langeur nous fe- 
 sait lentement savourer ! * 
 
 " For God's sake, let us speak of something else," 
 cried the queen, abruptly, in a broken voice, and after a 
 pause. 
 
 " How your heart beats! dear lady," said Ferraro, 
 almost unconsciously. 
 
 " Nay, did I not bid you speak of something else? — 
 My daughter, sir, if the tyrant insist, she must wed Iwan." 
 
 " No, by G — d ! not," exclaimed Ferraro. " And yet," 
 he added, more despondingly ; " what will be, will come,f 
 there's no opposing destiny." 
 
 "Destiny!" cried Isabella, indignantly; "is Marti- 
 nuzzi blown to such a greatness, he must not be opposed? 
 I'd cut the throat ." 
 
 " Whose throat, in Heaven's name?" demanded Fer- 
 raro, eagerly. 
 
 iK Rest thee, love," returned Isabella, again pressing 
 her burning lip on Ferraro's cheek : " rest thee, — the des- 
 tiny's, — that's all. You need not fly out so." 
 
 " Thy words are fire, turns all to flame it meets with," 
 cried Ferraro; "thou must mean something, — explain 
 yourself." The answer of Isabella, was a mute pressure 
 of the hand of Ferraro.

 " Yet silent ? Nevertheless, how loud thy dumbness ! 
 Oh God ! methinks the stillness of thy soul is fraught 
 with more turbulent horrors, than is a madhouse, with 
 the contending din of tortured and tormentors. How 
 would you have me think ?" 
 
 " How think, Antoine? why, like a hero, — if not, at 
 least a man, or like aught else, whose thoughts are 
 deeds,— think ! Oh that now you could but read my 
 heart! the burning language there might teach you ." 
 
 " If thou wilt, expound the page to me," said Fer- 
 raro. 
 
 " Why, Antoine," replied Isabella, " were I as thou, 
 and loved as thou dost, about to be despoiled of all thy 
 hopes, as thou wilt shortly be, ask me not what I'd think, 
 but what I'd perpetrate." There was a deep meaning 
 in the peculiar emphasis, with which Isabella delivered 
 these words, that made Ferraro shudder. 
 
 " Thou turnest my thoughts," he said, in a horrific 
 voice; " into the mirror of my secret soul, which shows 
 a gulf of darkness. The reflection tortures me ; lady, 
 I ask, what would you perpetrate?" 
 
 •' Why should one's enemy be longer-lived than other 
 men?" answered Isabella; " it should be remedied, and 
 
 were I like you, — I'd stab ," she broke off, grasping 
 
 Ferraro's hand convulsively. 
 
 "Stab!" repeated Ferraro, gasping for breath; — 
 " whom ? myself?" 
 
 " Thyself! dear Antoine," replied the queen, with a 
 smile upon her lip: " that were sage counsel — No, the 
 
 CARDINAL." 
 
 " The cardinal!" repeated Ferraro, in a tremulous and 
 hollow voice ; " what cardinal ? I shake !" 
 
 "Thou dost, indeed," said Isabella; and with the 
 view of quieting to rest the trepidation, which suddenly 
 seized every nerve of the Austrian secretary, she 
 strained him firmly to her, by the strong folding of her 
 arms. Why was it, that the lover of Czerina did not

 shrink from that delirious embrace? Alas ! he could not 
 resist the spell, that darkly bound him. His aching head 
 hung, half unconsciously, upon the alabaster shoulders of 
 the queen ; and it was her bosom that heaved so wildly, 
 beneath the passionate throbbings of his heart. 
 
 " I shake," repeated Ferraro; " what is the hour ? — 
 Is't midnight? It is as dark. It must be. Your victim 
 comes, Piadena, — only do you perform your part of our 
 engagement, and I will enact mine." 
 
 Saying these words, Ferraro burst abruptly from the 
 encircling embrace of Isabella, and began to traverse the 
 apartment. Ere he had taken many steps, he tottered, 
 and fell. It appeared, that the sort of opiate, with which 
 Isabella had drugged his cup, tended to inebriate, so to 
 speak, his bodily powers, without to a like extent, 
 clouding his mental faculties. Isabella silently left the 
 room, but presently returned, bearing a waxen taper, 
 with which she proceeded to illuminate several small 
 silver lamps, which, while they cast the whole apartment 
 into light, diffused, likewise, an entrancing odour, such as 
 enervates the thinking faculties, and wraps the whole 
 being in Elysium. Then, having replenished the inebri- 
 ating cups, she, with some difficulty, assisted Ferraro 
 to his former position on the low couch, and bending 
 softly over him, whispered, as she pressed her scorching 
 lips to his flushed cheek : 
 
 " I will kiss my love into life and smiles again. Re- 
 vive thee, dearest!" 
 
 Ferraro made no answer : he did not turn from the 
 maddening endearment of that contact, nor avoid the 
 meaning fire of that long gaze ; but, on the contrary, it 
 rather seemed, that he drank in at his eyes the contagion 
 of her glances, and as they sat, with hands interlocked, 
 and breath intermixed, every pore of Ferraro seemed 
 to thrill with a new sense, as if he had imbibed a portion 
 of that electric spirit, which ran its course, like lava, 
 through the veins of Isabella.

 " And the blood in their fingers intertwined, 
 Ran like the thoughts of a single mind, 
 As the swift emotions went and came, 
 Through the veins of each united frame."* 
 
 " The turbulent and stormy elements of sin and desire 
 were aroused even to madness, within them."f By a 
 mutual and uncontrollable impulse, the lips of this 
 guilty and devoted pair drew nearer and nearer, till they 
 met, and clung into quick faint kisses. Big drops from 
 heaven wept against the casement, — Ferraro recked not 
 what it might mean. Mournfully wailed the wind, — Isa- 
 bella's ears received no impression. Low thunder mut- 
 tered in the air, but neither heeded the minatory accents. — 
 What, to them, was fear or care beyond ?

 It was during one of those languid pauses, which ne- 
 cessarily intermit the soft communion of affection; — after

 Isabella broke that impressive charm, so fraught with 
 dreaming of the voiceless heart, so imbued with the sweet

 " Antoine," she murmured; "you spake awhile ago, 
 of Piadena, — of some engagement at midnight — say, dear, 
 what is't?" Ferraro started from her embrace. 
 
 " Ask me not," he replied, in a voice of uncontrollable 
 horror: "Ask me not, — rather aid me to stifle all re- 
 membrance of the deed, that he would have put me to, — 
 let me forget myself, and all the world, — in these dear 
 arms."

 he did not answer. " Oh speak," said Isabella, " I mark 
 you to a syllable." 
 
 " Such an one, lady," replied Ferraro, in alow, tremb- 
 ling, and awe-struck tone, " whose very apprehension, like 
 a spectre, shuns the wide gaze of day, to gibber within 
 the dim and inmost cavern of my thoughts, shrouded in 
 formless horror." This reply only whetted the anxiety 
 of Isabella, who, with intermingled blandishments, ques- 
 tioned him further. 
 
 Few men in an hour of amorous dalliance, can withhold 
 a secret from their fair companion. Draught after draught 
 did Ferraro quaff of the same fatal inebrient, that had 
 already proved so baneful. " Delicious poison !" — but 
 neither more deadly nor more sweet, than that flood of 
 passion, which he simultaneously inspired, from the deep 
 and powerful light of those eyes, whose beams, like 
 moonlight, swayed at will, the tempest of his thoughts. 
 After such insidious inescations, who • can doubt the 
 success of Isabella? In that unholy confessional, where 
 Ferraro was brought to his knees, the least concealment 
 or reservation was accounted a sin to the divinity of love, 
 nor did Isabella desist from her inquiries, and absolve 
 her devoted lover, till she had extorted from him, an ac- 
 count of all the eventful scenes, through which he had 
 passed that day. He related to her the secret of his 
 birth, — his engagement to join Scipio, beneath the ruin- 
 ous porchway, on the following midnight, with the view 
 of being introduced to his father, — the mode, by which 
 he obtained ingress to the palace. These matters, inter- 
 rupted with those soupirs entrecoupes, ces douces larmes 
 et ces gemissemens tendres, so touchingly enumerated 
 by St. Preux, did Ferraro deliver into the attentive 
 ear of Isabella. Whatever her surprise, at receiving such 
 pieces of information, it was trifling, when compared 
 with the entranced interest, with which she listened to 
 Ferraro's detail of his interview, that morning with the 
 MarquisofPiadena. The unhappy youth had, by this time,

 in a great measure, lost all observation of outward things, 
 or he would scarcely have failed to remark the extra- 
 ordinary emotion, which Isabella discovered at his rela- 
 tion. Every additional syllable, that issued, from her 
 victim's lips, was welcomed, by a look of triumph, so ex- 
 ulting, so malicious, so truly fiendish, that had Ferraro 
 not been utterly blinded by passion and vinolency, he 
 must have shrunk back aghast, from the flowery edge of 
 that abyss, over which his soul tottered. When he had 
 concluded, she thought deeply for several moments, ere 
 she spoke. 
 
 " And you are to carry this written consent, to-night 
 to Piadena?" she observed, with some abstraction of 
 manner, — after a long pause. 
 
 " At midnight, he proposed," answered Ferraro, " as 
 if — even midnight, — and 'tis winter, lady, — yet hark, how 
 the heavens mutter ! — hath a pall to wrap about a pur- 
 pose so vile, as that he named." 
 
 The brow of Isabella flushed with a still deeper shade 
 of thought. " To-night, Antoine," she repeated, without 
 paying attention to Ferraro's last words ; " 'tis a close 
 game ; — it wants an hour, scarcely, — then how — V* 
 
 With these incoherent musings, she gently unclasped 
 the arm, which circled the empire of her charms, and in- 
 sensibly drawing herself from Ferraro's side, rose from 
 that guilty sofa-seat. Every motion indicated, that her 
 bosom worked, with some strong conception. After 
 taking a single turn, with sharp, irregular step, she 
 paused in the middle of the apartment, and there stood, 
 lost in deep meditation. 
 
 " Dear lady !" inarticulately murmured Ferraro. 
 "At midnight, saidst thou?" returned Isabella, ab- 
 stractedly. " A written paper, too, interchanged between 
 ye? So — you may talk forward — my daughter's hand 
 the guerdon, — did it not run so? And Martinuzzi, who, 
 like the fabulous ferryman, hath wafted souls to hell ; — 
 himself immortal all the while, — to be plunged thither,

 at length, and by thee ! My course is clearer than the 
 sun's." She paused ; a lightning spirit flashed, from the 
 heaven of her eyes. " So so," she went on, in an in- 
 drawn and exulting tone : " my Lord Castaldo, we are 
 your slave for this; I'd rather, than angels sing a re- 
 quiem at my hearse, that he were dead ; I would, by 
 Heavens ! And now, to gain my ends, and yet omit the 
 sin and peril of this action ! — that the imperial court 
 should stake its credit and fair fame, on that I purposed ! 
 it is so wonderful — so beyond the compass of my brains, 
 that it looks more than natural ? Is't hell, or Heaven, 
 that thus tops my wishes, and smooths my path before 
 me ? Let me think." 
 
 She took several turns in the apartment, and then ap- 
 proaching Ferraro, who had sunk on the sofa totally ex- 
 hausted, and now reclined there, in a state not far re- 
 moved from unconsciousness, she took his hands in 
 hers : — •" Antoine," she said, in a soft and thrilling tone, 
 that discorded strangely with the dreadful purport of her 
 words, "thou wilt write this promise for Piadena." 
 
 " What promise, lady ?" returned Ferraro, in a feeble 
 voice. 
 
 "That which insures youth and beauty to thy arms, 
 Antoine ; wouldst thou desire to reap so rich a harvest, 
 as Czerina to wife, thou must begin in blood, and right 
 her wrongs, and in her wrongs, — mine, thine own, and 
 country's. Piadena said well, Antoine Pereny. The tyrant 
 of Erdely must die, — and, if it be a sin, 'tis well requited." 
 
 " Let, then, some other do the deed, — not I," cried 
 Ferraro. 
 
 " Some other be it then. What say you to the 
 Richter Iwan? Shall he strike the blow, and wed my 
 daughter ?" 
 
 "No, no!" exclaimed Ferraro; "only I, will wed 
 her." 
 
 "Then thou must right her wrongs, Antoine, in the 
 usurper's blood ; — thou wilt — thou shalt — " and, as if

 MANUSCRIPT XXVIII. 147 
 
 by magic, at least so it seemed to Ferraro's dim and un- 
 defined perception, at the moment, Isabella produced the 
 implements of writing. " Antoine," she continued, " as 
 a son of Hungary, thou art bound to seize this oppor- 
 tunity of liberating thy country. There, write me thy 
 promise to Piadena. The deed, thou wilt stipulate to 
 execute is holy, — holy, sir, pious and honourable ! and, 
 being done, will make thee, wert thou more vile, and 
 ranker, than the grave's mould, wholesome, and white 
 like snow !" 
 
 Ferraro reached out his hand, to receive the requisite 
 materials. 
 
 " That's well," proceeded Isabella ; " but, love, thou 
 canst not hold the pen ; I'll guide thy hand for thee." 
 Thus speaking, her soft palm closed on his hand, which 
 felt to the touch, like red-hot coal. " So, so ." 
 
 Ferraro's corporeal faculties were, by this time, ut- 
 terly overpowered, and, in the feverish and inebriated 
 condition of his mind, the infamy of adopting the bravo's 
 trade, was wholly lost sight of, or became complicated 
 with more agreeable contemplations, — the possession of 
 Czerina, and the vindication of the imaginary injuries 
 of his country. Under these circumstances, it will 
 scarcely excite surprise, that Isabella's arts and induce- 
 ments, finally broke through the feeble barriers of his 
 reeling reason ; but it is due to Ferraro to observe, it 
 was only, after all, by using a species of compulsion, by 
 aiding his trembling hand, to scrawl the few lines, she dic- 
 tated for him, that she succeeded in her iniquitous design. 
 
 However brief the verba scripta, which, by such ob- 
 noxious means, she managed to extort, owing to pecu- 
 liar circumstances, the nature of which the reader will 
 easily infer, from what has been already stated, their 
 manufacture occupied a considerable time. The night 
 fled fast; it wanted little more than a quarter to that 
 "witching hour," in which Ferraro was engaged, to wait. 
 upon the imperial general.

 Up to a certain point, ere yet a man hath ex- 
 ceeded the measure, prescribed by the Greek pro- 
 verb, * he may, without difficulty, restrict himself in 
 his offerings to Liber Pater; but let him only pass 
 the half-way house, between sobriety and vinolency, 
 and he will find his inclination to " drink deep," rapidly 
 increase upon him, somewhat in the ratio, that his ca- 
 pacity of endurance fails him. Whether the power, 
 who takes the juice of the poppy under his especial aus- 
 pices, be Morpheus, or Bacchus, or, as Statius insinu- 
 ates, Ceres, f I am sure I know not, nor, probably, did 
 Ferraro, though he sacrificed to the deity's honour, in 
 bumpers, which far outnumbered the libations of the 
 epigrammatist of old, to the god of slumber.! The con- 
 sequence was not at all an exception to the general rule, 
 in such cases. Just as the wretched youth subscribed 
 the fatal paper, with his signature, Isabella adminis- 
 tered another crowned cup. The trepidation which shook 
 him was so violent, that he stood in need of her offices, 
 to raise it to his lips; — he tasted; — drank off the con- 
 tents, — ay, to the dregs, and, as he did so, having passed 
 through all the successive phases of inebriation, the lids 
 of his eyes fell, and he rolled heavily off his seat, upon 
 the carpet, — feverish, unmanned, — a helpless, senseless 
 clod of earth. 
 
 Here we would observe, par parenthese, that the 
 hackneyed aphorism of Terence, touching the dependence 
 of Venus upon Ceres and the god of wine, is hardly borne 
 out by the fact. Whatever may be offered in favour of

 the right, in gifting Lyaeus, and not the lady, with the 
 province of the barley field and the hop yard,) at all 
 events, the queen of love owes little to the generous god, 
 who, however he may incite to action over the bottle, is 
 apt to " equivocate with a man,"* leaving him sometimes 
 sadly in the lurch, when he comes to transfer his worship 
 to a softer shrine. Thus, it proved with Ferraro, whose 
 state of insensibility suggested our observation. For a 
 moment, Isabella stood beside him, in undissembled tri- 
 umph. She might have exclaimed, in the words of the 
 Moorish prince, when he bestrode his prostrate conqueror, 
 " Crown me, shadow me with laurels, ye spirits who 
 delight in just revenge." Removing the writing out of 
 his relaxed hold, she deposited it in her bosom, — at that 
 moment the cathedral clock tolled the hour of midnight. 
 Heavily sounded forth the solemn peal, on the fitful 
 breezes of the night. Isabella started as the vibration 
 caught her ear, but the very next instant her eye lighted 
 up, with fiendish exultation, and her lip curved with an 
 anomalous expression, such as an illustrator of Milton's 
 Pandasmonium, would be glad, to transfer to his canvass, 
 to deepen the horror of that multitudinous array of hell- 
 ish countenances, by the introduction of a single con- 
 trast, more horrible than all,.. the smile of a fallen 
 angel ! 
 
 " I must be stirring, lest I be too late," murmured Isa- 
 bella to herself. 
 
 At that moment, a peal of thunder rolled over the city. 
 The royal dame threw open the casement, and looked 
 abroad on the horrors of the night. " Is it the deed — 
 ye elements?" she said. " Is this your tone of wrath ? 
 The spirit of the tempest on the darkness, doth write, in 
 characters of living fire — revenge ! Were 1 now super- 
 stitious, or cared for omens, such an hour, and such a 
 night, might well deter me; but my soul is fixed — fixed

 as the key-stone of creation, and so is its own omen, — 
 then let the elements rage!" 
 
 With the stupefaction of Ferraro, the legitimate in- 
 terest of this scene, is at an end ; we, therefore, lay by 
 our styli officium * for some fifteen or twenty minutes, 
 after which, we request the gentle reader will favour us, 
 with his company across the square, since the course of 
 our zig-zag narrative wanders, for a few moments, to 
 a large stone structure, where, by the way, we made a 
 call on the Marquis of Piadena, in the beginning of the 
 current manuscript. 
 
 The city was wrapt in darkness, excepting, when, at 
 intervals, a shifting gleam of moonlight would glance, 
 like a visiting spectre, on some steep and narrow gable, 
 and the heavens seemed to let loose the flood-gates of 
 their wrath, into a single heavy compact shower, when a 
 private door of the palace gardens opened, and a figure, 
 muffled in a light military cloak, but nothing like so 
 closely enveloped, as the inclemency of the weather de- 
 manded, issued, stealthily, forth, and wading with diffi- 
 culty to the grand square, asked, at the mansion we men- 
 tioned, to speak with the imperial general. 
 
 The person we speak of, stood, at the moment of pre- 
 ferring this request, at the threshold of a wide gateway, 
 that, built between two pieces of masonry, gave entrance 
 to the building. The officer on duty, to whom the ap- 
 plication was made, was stationed at some paces within 
 the porch, and beyond was a sort of lamp, that diffused 
 but a feeble light, burning upon a pedestal. The dress 
 of the speaker bespoke the man of rank, but it evidently 
 afforded inadequate protection against the weather. The 
 folds of the dripping cloak, being flung across his 
 shoulder, discovered the rich embroidered garments un- 
 derneath, not very accurately adjusted, and, at present, 
 soiled with mud and rain. His Spanish hat, richly

 looped with pearls, a piece of coxcombry much affected 
 at the period by the cavaliers of the Austrian court, was 
 slouched low over the forehead, and, to complete the 
 mysterious tout-ensemble of our portraiture, the indivi- 
 dual in question was masked. 
 
 " Why, now, if this be not a good joke," replied the 
 janitor, after fixing, for more than a minute, an earnest 
 gaze of scrutiny on the applicant ; " and you think, I 
 don't know who you are ?" 
 
 He in the mask started. 
 
 " Come, off with your vizor, and tell me what mad 
 mummery is this ? Thinkest thou, that that hose, purfled 
 with silver, and the orthodox cut of that jmurpoint, 
 slashed out so exquisitely, and so trimly surmounted 
 with that Spanish cuello of thine, can be overlooked ? — 
 or that the quaint device of those braided pantoflesi 
 once beheld, is ever to be forgotten ? Is it not a folly 
 now for a man to go masked, and yet rig himself, witli 
 such tell-tale tags, as thou hast about thee ? What, 
 though thou reekest with rain-water, I'd swear to thy 
 raiment, and know thee among a thousand — Marc An- 
 toine Ferraro." 
 
 " Then prithee bear my message to the Marquis of 
 Piadena," said the other, in a low and uncertain voice. 
 
 " There, thou strivest hard to disguise thy familiar ac- 
 cents, as thou hast thy face ; but it wont do — you are 
 discovered — master secretary, you are discovered." 
 
 " If it be so, hie thee to our lord, and tell him I wait — 
 I am here by appointment." 
 
 " That alters the case," replied the officer; '* and now 
 I remember me, I understood as much ; but why not go 
 at once yourself? — you will find him in his chamber." 
 
 " No, what I have to say must be spoken in this place ; 
 my minutes, at present are numbered — I have business 
 on hand. You see, I am masked." 
 
 "I am not blind," returned the officer; "but are

 you mad, that you expect his excellency will wait upon 
 you here ; — but have your way." 
 
 " Stay !" exclaimed the stranger, as the officer was 
 retiring. " Make my excuses to our lord, and tell him 
 how I am situated ; mention, moreover, that I have 
 brought with me that written paper, we spoke off. If his 
 excellence do not choose to come to me, he will, per- 
 haps, transmit the receipt through you, who can bear 
 him back this instrument." Saying these words, the 
 masked individual drew from his vest a small paper, 
 folded and sealed. 
 
 " Well, may I never be married, if thy brain be not 
 touched, Ferraro ! — I've conjectured as much many a 
 time and oft, but now I am assured of it. This humour 
 passes, — but 'tis our lord's affair, and none of mine." 
 
 With tljese words, delivered sotto voce, the officer with- 
 drew, and the next minute tapped at the chamber-door of 
 the imperial general. 
 
 " Enter !" exclaimed a commanding voice from 
 within. 
 
 " Ha ! 'tis past the hour assigned, and I thought it 
 had been Ferraro," said the Marquis of Piadena, in a 
 tone of disappointment, as, throwing himself back on his 
 easy seat, the door reclosed on the person of his officer- 
 in-waiting. 
 
 " Your lordship's secretary is now below," said this 
 latter, and he proceeded to detail the particulars of his 
 message. 
 
 " Hem !" ejaculated Castaldo, when he had con- 
 cluded; " the dolt has come to, more easily than I ex- 
 pected — perhaps it were better thus. We can settle the 
 when and where, another time. The boy shall have his 
 way." 
 
 Thus saying, he drew towards him an ink-glass, 
 and, extracting a sheet of paper from a portfolio, that 
 lay convenient, traced a few lines thereupon, which he

 signed and sealed.* Holding it out to the attendant, he 
 bade him give the writing, into the hands of his secretary. 
 The officer presently returned with the paper of Ferraro, 
 and again quitted the chamber. Castaldo hastily broke 
 open the wax, and read these words : 
 
 "To His Excellency the Marquis of Piadena. 
 " My lord, I offer myself a willing instrument to effect 
 the salvation of Transylvania, and am ready to avenge 
 the injuries and insults, which King Ferdinand hath re- 
 ceived, in the blood of his arch-enemy. At whatever 
 time your excellency shall please to appoint, — Cardi- 
 nal Martinuzzi meets his death by the hand of your faith- 
 ful secretary, Marc Atsitoine Pereny." 
 
 " Pereny !" soliloquised Castaldo, in a voice of asto- 
 nishment. " How, and when did the infatuated fool as- 
 certain his parentage ? I guessed it, from the moment, I 
 learned from - the Cygani, that Scipio, with whom he so 
 much consorteth, and Peter Pereny were one and the 
 same. Besides, his likeness to that false woman, troubled 
 me from the first, and, therefore, would I have him do 
 this deed. And, doth he know the country of his birth, 
 and yet consents ? — By my coronet, 'tis exquisite ven- 
 geance ! The all-powerful Pereny shall fall unwept, un- 
 known, unhonoured; and his offspring, by her, whom, in 
 the grave I hate, as only those, whose detestation is en- 
 gendered in disappointed love, can hate — his offspring 
 shall work my own, and Ferdinand's politic ends, to be 
 requited with the headsman's axe." 
 
 * The warrant, or rather order, for the assassination of Martinuzzi, is 
 still extant. It is signe.l Piadena, and directed to the following con- 
 spirators, viz. : Marc Antoine Ferraro, Sforza Pelavicini, Campagio 
 Monina, Piacintino, Scaramoncia, and Don Lopez. Superstition failed 
 not afterwards to remark, that, as happened to the murderers of Cajsar, 
 not one of the above escaped an untimely and bloody end.

 Matters were thus situated, when there rode, one morn- 
 ing, into Hermanstadt, a chieftain of distinguished car- 
 riage, at the head of a band of gallant horsemen, all 
 admirably equipped in burnished armour. It was in the 
 course of the same day, that this stranger was left wait- 
 ing, during a few minutes, in the vestibule of the citadel 
 of Hermanstadt. Allowing for some slight touches of 
 Time's effacing fingers on the lineaments of the man's 
 countenance, and that age had lodged his avant couriers 
 of silver, more thickly, amid the dark, close-curled locks, 
 of his noble head, this individual neither betrayed, in 
 feature nor form, any decay of strength, since our de-

 as brightly now, as they did a dozen years before.

 manuscripts, Peter, Count Pereny, who, having demanded 
 an audience, found himself presently ushered into the

 regent's presence-chamber, — the same magnificent apart- 
 ment, described in a former manuscript. Martinuzzi was 
 seated before a table, covered with several state papers. 
 There also lay open a parchment-covered illuminated 
 tome, containing some of the orthodox writings of the 
 primate of Egypt,* whose unpremeditated style he ad- 
 mired, and whose genius and character, in other respects, 
 bore no faint similitude to his own. He slightly changed 
 colour on Pereny's entrance, but quickly recovered his 
 outward composure, as the graf, with a haughty and 
 formal inclination, took the seat, to which he had been 
 pointed. The room was cleared, the attendants had 
 withdrawn, and these two celebrated men remained, for 
 some minutes, in thoughtful silence ; both with reserved 
 mien, and somewhat pale and anxious countenances, but 
 both stern and collected. The sweet and painful memo- 
 ries of almost half a century were theirs in common, and 
 here they sat, after near a life of mysterious communi- 
 cations, and reciprocal reserves, preparatory to a mutual 
 and final understanding. 
 
 " Your eminence was prepared for this visit," began 
 Pereny. 
 
 " I am glad you're come," returned Martinuzzi ; add- 
 ing, internally, " Shall I not die for that ?" Then, more 
 audibly, he proceeded, " Am I, at last, to congratulate 
 you, my lord, on the resumption of your rank and sta- 
 tion, in Hungary ?" 
 
 " That must depend upon circumstances, your emi- 
 nence," replied Pereny. " It is certain, that I have this 
 day cast off for ever the veil of mystery, which for long 
 hath wrapt about me, like a shroud ; but, whether my 
 doing so be a subject for your gratulation, I shall be 
 better assured of, before we separate. In any case, I 
 know what I owe myself, and what my country, and will 
 not be made the tool of thy ambition. If, therefore, you

 still dream, that I, Peter Pereny, was born to be the 
 puppet, to serve the ends of any man, and then to be cast 
 off as something valueless, you err egregiously ; — the 
 blood of a hundred ancestors forbids such dishonour. — 
 Nay, hear me out ; I know you deem the fabric of your 
 power impregnable ; but have a care, — do not push aside 
 the scaffolding, lest the superstructure totter at its foun- 
 dations." 
 
 " Do you threaten, sir?" said Martinuzzi. 
 
 " No, my lord," replied Pereny; "I only say thus 
 much to put you on your guard ; the ground, you stand 
 upon, fails from under your feet ; one false step — but 
 have a care." 
 
 For an instant, there was a hectic on Martinuzzi's 
 cheek ; — it passed away. " And have I been your sa- 
 viour for this?" he demanded, with some warmth; — 
 " have I, for so many years, preserved you, from the 
 Cygani's threatened steel, by communicating with him 
 myself, in the guise of Father Dominick, and thus pre- 
 cluding the possibility of his conjecturing, that your lord- 
 ship's person was concealed, beneath the monk's habili- 
 ments ? — have I stooped, to connive at certain infamous 
 devices, lowered my otherwise unsullied office, and 
 stained my fair name, by making it the shield of Father 
 Dominick's reputed practices? — Is this your gratitude, 
 my lord, now that, at length, your fears for your life 
 are past ? Are reproaches my only thanks? and threats 
 to be my recompense ?" 
 
 " And have you nothing to be thankful for in turn ? 
 Consider," said Pereny. 
 
 ''Perhaps I may have," said Martinuzzi ; " but the sub- 
 ject is distressing, — the spirit of Beatrice hath only lately 
 sought a happier sphere ; for her, indeed, a blessed 
 change, but the wound in my bosom is too recent, my 
 lord ; the allusion agonizes me." 
 
 There was a long pause, ere Pereny made answer. 
 " I would not causelessly grieve your eminence," he

 said, " but the time has at length arrived, when it is in- 
 dispensable we should confer, without reserve ; — I have 
 much to say, that cannot be delivered so well hereafter. 
 Hear me, and you will have cause to be thankful, that I 
 have not deferred my communication, till too late."' 
 
 " You can speak forward," said Martinuzzi, with a 
 slight inclination of the head. 
 
 " My lord," said Pereny, after a short pause, " 'tis 
 now many years since I first made proposals, for the 
 hand of Kins,- John's sister." 
 
 Traces, as if distressing and touching images, rose on 
 his memory, passed, like a cloud, across the countenance 
 of Martinuzzi, but he spoke not. 
 
 " Circumstances, at that time, broke off the purposed 
 union. [ afterwards married, as you know, in Vienna, 
 the mother of Marc Antoine. On her decease, I quitted 
 Austria, repaired to Hermanstadt, and again sought the 
 honour of the Princess Beatrice's alliance." 
 
 " Surely, my lord, this preamble might be spared me," 
 said Martinuzzi. 
 
 "I see not how," returned Pereny ; " the union I 
 solicited came recommended to the princess, by Queen 
 Isabella's earnest sanction. She prevailed upon the 
 Turkish minister, to give it his authoritative approval. 
 Solyman was appealed to — his will was promulged in 
 favour of the match ; and, I need not tell your highness, 
 that, at that time, in Hungary, the sultan's will was law." 
 
 " It was not long so after; I rectified that error at 
 least," said Martinuzzi proudly ; " and, however they may 
 submit in Vienna, the crosses of Septem Castra* areun-

 thus anatomized." 
 
 " Things were situated as I have stated," proceeded 
 Pereny, " when, one day, you called me aside, and — " 
 
 " I did," broke in Martinuzzi, with some heat ; " and 
 I little thought, after such services — (and, since you 
 urge me thus far, my lord, let me call to your remem-

 will have it so, I will recapitulate those denotements I 
 then confided to your honour. I told you, that, brought 
 up under her mother's roof, the Princess Beatrice and 
 myself had conceived, in earliest youth, a reciprocal at- 
 tachment, and that, while yet children in the eye of the 
 law, our fates were irrevocably woven together. Two 
 persons were present, at those holy rites of love and mar- 
 riage, Luke Swartz and his sister Alicia; in either of 
 whose keeping, I thought, I might safely entrust my 
 dearest interests. It happened, I was mistaken ; — of 
 Swartz no more, — but his unhappy sister, as I after- 
 wards learned, betrayed our union to the Countess Scaepas. 
 
 " The rage of Beatrice's mother, at hearing that her 
 daughter had thrown herself away, on so friendless a 
 being, as I was at that time, and her consequent tyrannous 
 proceedings, I will not repeat to you at large. I ex- 
 plained, then, the nature of those unholy machinations, of 
 that unintermitted course of overbearing persecution, by 
 the operation of which the countess finally prevailed, on 
 the, not naturally strong, mind of Beatrice, to break off 
 our intercourse. Bending the whole strength of her 
 powerful genius to the accomplishment of this one darling 
 object, — armed with the two-edged sword of a parent's 
 
 were for centuries, surmounted with a cross and star, Solyman having 
 engaged, at the siege of that city in 1529, in reverence of such holy 
 symbols, to spare the edifice. — See Brown's Travels in Dacia, Styria, 
 &c. London. 4to. 1688.

 power, and almost regal authority, — -both of us conscious 
 that our marriage was illegal, on account of our nonage, 
 and therefore liable to be set aside, by ecclesiastical 
 judicature, — what wonder, thus beset with every species 
 of dire machinery, that Beatrice's determination at length 
 gave way, under such accumulated pressure, or that I, 
 out of very love to her, could no longer withstand or 
 elude her mother's stern, and relentless will? What 
 wonder, that all the earthly hopes and happiness of two 
 young, and, I may truly add, my lord, two guileless, un- 
 sophisticated human beings, should be immolated, to ap- 
 pease the insatiate maw of the moloch of family pride and 
 aggrandizement ? Enough, — I resolved upon the sacrifice, 
 and fled in despair to the monastery of Erdium, where, in 
 no long time, my monastic vows seemed to place a per- 
 petual bar, between me and my beloved. But the means 
 employed, to wrench from the princess her consent, to our 
 separation, stunned for ever the buoyancy of her youth, 
 and undermined her reason, — she pined in thought, and 
 lay for many months, with an oppressive weight upon her 
 spirits, — a morbid sense of being deserted and left deso- 
 late ; from which state of hypochondriasis she only par- 
 tially recovered, on my rejoining her, and her brother in 
 Poland. 
 
 " The countess was then no more. These circumstances 
 I detailed to you at large. I threw myself upon your 
 honour, and implored you not to press your suit, — you met 
 my disclosure by a proposition, which was unexpected, 
 and which I own startled me not a little. You wished to 
 stipulate, that your late son, my nephew Maximilian, 
 should wed the Lady Czerina, on her attaining the age, at 
 which, according to King John's will, I was to resign the 
 sceptre to her rule. To this, I replied at once, that if 
 Maximilian should turn out worthy of her highncss's hand, 
 and there was no objection on her part, I would prove no 
 obstacle to the union. Thus the matter rested, when you,

 my lord, in company with the princess, set forth for 
 Buda. Why need we say more ? Why recall our precon- 
 certed attack upon your retinue, in the forest of Belivar, 
 and its disastrous consequence ? Why are my feelings 
 to be harrowed up, by the remembrance of that flesh 
 wound, from a chance shot, which, together with her fright, 
 unsettled for ever the intellects of Beatrice? Whether in 
 the Cygani's cave, tended, by the Gipsy Unna, or within 
 these walls, by some of her people, the existence of that 
 persecuted lady was, then ceforth, as you know, ablank; — 
 and now," concluded Martinuzzi, " that, like some evil 
 genius, you have uplifted the gravestone from my heart, 
 by invoking these bitter recollections, like spectres to 
 scare and madden me, what is to be ? To what purpose 
 our conference ? — say, my lord, and let's have done with 
 this, — 1 am not well. Is there aught else ?" 
 
 " Much," returned Pereny, with considerable solem- 
 nity of manner, — " And first, of Maximilian. I grant, his 
 dissolute proceedings formed some excuse for your annul- 
 ling our contract, in his regard. Such vain and idle con- 
 duct, as he exhibited, was unworthy the high blood of 
 Pereny, — but the boy is dead, — murdered, — let his earth 
 be sacred. I cannot blame you," resumed the magnat, 
 after a pause given to natural emotion, " wishing to evite 
 such a match for the Lady Czerina. I saw your scruples 
 were not ill-founded, and therefore proposed to substitute 
 Marc Antoine, in the place of Maximilian." 
 
 " And I," answered Martinuzzi, " as in the instance of 
 my nephew, qualified my acceptance of your offer. But 
 Marc Antoine, still less than his elder brother, merits the 
 hand of Czerina. Our compact is clearly void." 
 
 " What !" exclaimed Pereny, " is she not the object of 
 the foolish boy's idolatry? the pivot, on which his all of 
 happiness turns — and more, is not his passion recipro- 
 cated ?" 
 
 " I hope to God, not," said Martinuzzi, in an impres- 
 sive voice.

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 161 
 
 " You hope not — why so, in the name of Heaven ?" 
 demanded Pereny, hotly. 
 
 " Because," replied the regent, with great calmness, 
 " it is my fixed determination, that Marc Antoine, your 
 son, my lord, shall never wed the queen of Hungary." 
 
 Pereny started up, took two rapid turns across the 
 apartment, resumed his seat, and said, with the hasty 
 articulation of a deeply offended person — " your reasons ? 
 your reasons, my lord ?" 
 
 " I explained my reasons yesterday," replied Marti- 
 nuzzi, " the plain unvarnished fact of his cohabiting with 
 Isabella, while he pretends to her daughter's hand, will 
 surely justify my refusal. The character of Maximilian 
 owned many redeeming points, — what I think of your 
 younger son, I should be sorry to say in your lordship's 
 hearing. Let it suffice, he weds not Czerina." 
 
 " Not whilst it suits your ambitious ends to unite her 
 
 to to the Richter lvvan," said Pereny, indignantly; 
 
 "-for this, I blow away to the opposite winds of heaven, 
 all further forbearance and respect, all moderation, which 
 for years hath been my daily use, but which were now a 
 mockery of the holy cause of truth, and justice. My 
 lord cardinal, I was shut up for two hours last night, in 
 the dungeon of Hubert Vicchy." Pereny paused, and 
 fixed a stern eye, on Martinuzzi, whose countenance, 
 either through anger, or some deeper passion, grew 
 deadly pale, but he made no reply. 
 
 " What need of words," resumed Pereny ; " there is 
 an intelligence, between soul and soul, far more rapid, 
 and less deceptive. You know, already, those denote- 
 ments, I have to make." 
 
 " Nevertheless," observed Martinuzzi. with forced 
 composure, " I'll borrow patience, a little time, to listen 
 to these insults." 
 
 "Then understand, my lord cardinal," said Pereny, 
 " that I know, and have been cognizant of the fact for

 years, that Czerina, the reputed heiress of these domi- 
 nions, is not the daughter of King John and Isabella." 
 
 He paused. His eyes, and those of Martinuzzi, met — 
 the regent turned paler than before. 
 
 " She is not the child of John of Zapola," continued 
 Pereny, " but of his sister Beatrice; and, notwithstand- 
 ing the rigid vows of his order, Cardinal Martinuzzi is 
 her father." 
 
 " And you have known this for years ?" said Marti- 
 nuzzi, with strange calmness. 
 
 "That you were Lady Czerina's father, I heard, long 
 before I offered my hand to the Princess Beatrice ; and 
 you yourself, by mentioning your private marriage, suffi- 
 ciently indicated, who was her mother. Think you, 
 that the interview in the vaults of Hcrmanstadt, between 
 that lady and her child, which, in hopes of awakening 
 the princess, from her torpid and despondent condition, 
 the gipsy, Unna, so cleverly planned, and accomplished, 
 — think you, it must not have awakened my suspicions, 
 had I not, previously, been acquainted with all the cir- 
 cumstances ? I once beheld, by chance, the sentry, whose 
 duty it was, to keep guard on the precipice, and recollected 
 the man to be the same, who headed your Moldavians, 
 in the affair of the forest of Belivar. I guessed, more- 
 over, from some few words that, in the chateau of Count 
 Rodna, passed between me and the Duke of Eissenburg, 
 that he, the reputed agent in that matter, and the real 
 leader, were, in fact, brothers. In the character of 
 Scipio, in which alone 1 held communication witli 
 Unna, I once, when she was dubious, how to get the 
 coffin of Czerina borne through the vaults, and pas- 
 sives, hinted at that circumstance. Upon this hint, 
 she acted, by holding out the promise of information, 
 touching his brother's fate ; — a gipsy-maid allured the 
 sentry into the vaults; — it might be gathered, from the 
 man's confession, that, owing to the likeness of Czerina

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 163 
 
 to her mother, he mistook her, for the spectre of the 
 Princess Beatrice, to whose supposed murder, in the 
 forest of Belivar, he imagined himself accessary. Also, 
 it appears, that the Cygani Alaric would, under the like 
 delusion, and to answer some unknown, villanous pro- 
 ject, have stabbed her to death. It was I, whom the 
 villain sought, in those vaults ; for, baffled by our com- 
 mon personation of Father Dominick, he came to suspect, 
 that the victim, he hunted through the world, with such 
 hot rancour, was disguised, in the garb of the African. 
 I visited the chamber, where you had caused the sentry 
 to be confined, in order, as I told you, to reassure my- 
 self, that he was the brother of Eissenburg. Some weeks 
 after, Luke Swartz, by your orders, aided the escape 
 of Albert of Eissenburg, through the secret door of the 
 dungeon, the carcase of one of the national troop, was 
 discovered festering in the fosse, beyond the ramparts, 
 having about his person that terrific writing, addressed 
 to the citizens of Hermanstadt." 
 
 The brow of Martinuzzi was clouded, with a kind of 
 forced humility. " Why call up these painful memories, 
 my lord," he said. "You knew, at the time, that the 
 corpse was that of one, who had fallen in quarrel with 
 Alaric Polgar ; and that the writing, with its signature, 
 was inscribed by the Cygani, out of the very wanton- 
 ness of his malignity. You, doubtless, remember I ex- 
 plained the matter to you, as I had it, from the mouth of 
 the insolent villain, a few days subsequent to the disco- 
 very of the body." 
 
 " And wherefore, may I inquire, did you suffer that 
 man to escape the arm of justice for so many years?" 
 demanded Pereny. 
 
 The gloom of Martinuzzi's brow darkened, and he 
 turned away his head. 
 
 " But your whole life is of a piece, my lord cardinal,' 
 continued the indignant noble ; " for what reasons, think

 you, do I enumerate these scandalous items of your po- 
 licy ? To exhibit the nature of that degrading and mys- 
 terious life, I stooped to endure so long. Have I not 
 been as one apart, and alien from my kind ? — foregoing 
 the comforts of social life, — renouncing the honours and 
 privileges of my rank, — practising unworthy delusions, — 
 submitting to unheard of privations ? And this, with 
 only a single ray of hope, glimmering faintly, in the dark 
 vista of futurity ; — namely, that the sceptre of Hungary 
 should, hereafter, be swayed by the race of Pereny. I 
 will not survive the extinguishing of that ray," con- 
 cluded the magnat, in a bolder and more energetic tone. 
 " Nor do you dream, my lord, that Czerina, whose very 
 existence slurs the character of a prince of the church, 
 shall be let triumph in the downfall of my house." 
 
 " Indeed Pereny, you err," said Martinuzzi, after a 
 pause. " In any event, my daughter is rightful heir; — 
 what would you have ?" 
 
 Pereny's countenance lighted up, with a bitter and 
 scornful expression ; he, however, returned no answer. 
 
 " Consider," proceeded Martinuzzi, in bland and per- 
 suasive accents, " the espousals of myself and the sister 
 of King John were legal. The Lady Czerina is the issue 
 of our union ; and, although her birth occurred, long 
 subsequent to my taking the ecclesiastical vows, you well 
 know, that the ordinance of St. Stephen,* permitting 
 priests to marry, though seldom cited, has never been 
 abrogated ; it was ratified in that celebrated council, held 
 by St. Ladislas at Sabloc,f and not long after by Colo- 
 
 * St. Stephen. This pious and enlightened lawgiver, was the Alfred 
 the Great of Hungary. See his life, ab Episcopo Chartuitio conscripta, 
 &c. a. L. Surio edita. To object to his political system, that it based 
 the monarchy too entirely on the will of the privileged classes, to the 
 exclusion of the Villain Jobagiones, were to view it by the light of the 
 nineteenth century. The saint was not wise beyond his generation. —

 man at Strigonie.* You are likewise aware of my influ- 
 ence at Rome, which, were I ever driven to acknowledge 
 the facts of the case, would enable me to remedy all ap- 
 parent illegality. You cannot, be ignorant, that these 
 territories, according to the gift of the pope, are already 
 mine. Trust me, at the first hint of my wish, I could 
 have the donative transferred to the daughter of the 
 late princess Beatrice, to the niece of John of Za- 
 pola." 
 
 Still Pereny returned no answer, save a smile, slight 
 indeed, and ambiguous, but significant, of deep and quiet 
 exultation, and there appeared a conscious triumph, in the 
 magnat's very silence, which meant more than met the 
 eye, and, like the taciturn rebuke of the shade of Ajax, 
 transcended all articulate expression. Gladly would Mar- 
 tinuzzi, despite his natural tact and sensibility, the anten- 
 na of a tender conscience, have shunned interpreting that 
 hushed eloquence. Pereny darted the light of his keen 
 eye, full upon the countenance of the regent, as if to 
 pierce into the depths of his soul ; but, however he might 
 inwardly wince, beneath the probing operation, not the 
 working of a single muscle betrayed inquietude. The 
 mutual silence lasted more than a minute. Martinuzzi 
 resumed the conversation. 
 
 " What am I to infer, my lord," he said, " from your 
 remaining mute V 
 
 It was after a brief and painful pause, that Pereny 
 made answer. " Thus much, your eminence," he said, 
 with stern emphasis ; " that if you seek the transfer of 
 that grant, you boast of, you will risk your fair name 
 and reputation to little purpose. " The Lady Czerina 
 shall never reign in Hungary, unless she share her 
 regal power, with Marc Antoine Pereny ; such is my 
 fixed resolve. You had better look to it in time." 
 
 " This is too insolent, my lord Pereny," returned Mar-

 tinuzzi, and dangerous fire shot from his eyes, as he 
 spoke. " Beware, that thou urgest me not too far. I 
 can licence much at your hands, considering our rela- 
 tions, for so many years, but there is a limit to my for- 
 bearance. My blood is somewhat unruly, and I cannot, 
 at all times, answer for myself; so please to put a rein 
 upon these intemperate sallies — do you hear, — I'm not 
 apt to endure further." 
 
 " My lord cardinal, do you adopt this tone with me ?" 
 hotly demanded Pereny, his blood rushing into his face. 
 
 "Ay! by my soul! do I," replied Martinuzzi, in a 
 voice, that shook the chamber where they sat, — " with 
 you? — with any man, who forgets the respect, due to our 
 sacred office. Curb your insolence of speech, — I have 
 told you it offends me." 
 
 "This is beyond belief!" exclaimed the equally proud 
 noble. " Have you grown mad?" 
 
 " Another word, Pereny, in that tone of defiance," 
 cried Martinuzzi, with greater mastery over himself, and 
 speaking in a firmer, and more concentrated voice, — 
 " another word, T call my guards, and have you arrested 
 on the spot." 
 
 " And for what do you take me, sir ?" returned Pe- 
 reny, calmly, and with no little dignity of manner. " I 
 am no more fool than coward, nor have thrust my head 
 into the lion's den, without being provided with a suffi- 
 cient surety. I trench my life about in triple steel, by 
 involving its safety in your own, — your own — nay, pos- 
 sibly, in that of Czerina ; and, also, in what, if I greatly 
 err not, you are even more chary of than either, your 
 fame, — your fair fame, lord cardinal." 
 
 Martinuzzi made no immediate reply, but sat for 
 many minutes, apparently absorbed, in some deep and 
 anxious mental argument. Whatever was the subject of 
 his internal debate, its importance might be partly ga- 
 thered from the evident intensity of his abstraction. He

 seemed to have forgot himself to marble — not a sense 
 and faculty, but was occupied, with the world within, and 
 all perception of the material, and palpable objects 
 around, became for the time obscured. 
 
 Pereny likewise continued silent, and looked on, half- 
 awed, like one, seeking to penetrate the mystery of that 
 last unmoved slumber, where the passions, errors, and 
 sorrows of a life, lie " hushed into depths beyond the 
 watcher's diving." Fixed, and instinct with an expres- 
 sion, not unallied to melancholy, was the spelled gaze of 
 Pereny, upon the pale and accurately chisseled features 
 of Martinuzzi, and never was there a face, which more 
 impressively combined, in its main lineaments, the calm 
 godlike stamp of some classic model, with the softer 
 characteristics of human genius and sensibility. How 
 seldom, among the common-place herd of living men 
 and women, do we meet with a physiognomy, that might 
 serve, from its sharp profile, and otherwise intellectual 
 turn, for a specimen of the antique, and, apart from the 
 factitious interest, with which association of idea uncon- 
 sciously gifts such classic contour of countenance, it 
 were still rarer to find it accompanied, with the more at- 
 tractive characteristics of beautiful expression. But the 
 countenance of Martinuzzi, eminently blended mascu- 
 line beauty, with a rigid and marbly outline ; and Pe- 
 reny, as he kept his steadfast eye upon the cardinal, was 
 conscious, though he hardly knew wherefore, of the pe- 
 culiar interest, inseparable, from such harmonious union 
 of opposite qualities. There was no small resemblance in 
 some respects, though a striking dissimilitude in others, be- 
 tween the characters of these two men ; — both were first- 
 rate statesmen and excellent captains — both were ambi- 
 tious, but the ambition of Martinuzzi was of a loftier 
 kind, than that of Pereny, whose love of fame was compa- 
 ratively feeble, and whose objects were mostly personal 
 and selfish. Whatever abilities the magnat occasionally

 displayed, his proceedings were far from discovering either 
 conduct or firmness, while the pretensions of Martinuzzi 
 were better sustained, by his mental qualities, natural and 
 acquired. The native pre-eminence of hereditary rank, 
 hardly balanced the ministerial honours of the regency, 
 or the prestige of official sanctity, and Pereny's misfor- 
 tune, in being destitute of that perseverance, necessary 
 to surmount difficulties, naturally lost him somewhat of 
 that influence, over the minds of his countrymen, which 
 Martinuzzi, by inflexibly adhering to whatsoever he un- 
 dertook, until, through whatever danger and discourage- 
 ment, he conducted it to a happy issue, had succeeded 
 in acquiring. But there was still another, and more 
 marked feature, in the regent's character, which dis- 
 tinguished him, from his noble rival — it consisted in that 
 melancholy, that acute sensibility, which has been pro- 
 nounced* the painful inheritance of men of genius, but 
 which, in the instance of Martinuzzi, owned, moreover, 
 we are sorry to add, a less ennobling origin. 
 
 If, as Catholic divines affirm, the judgments we suffer 
 in the flesh, tell, in mitigation of punishment in the spirit, 
 what a mighty instalment must that man daily deposit, 
 in the sinking-fund of his secret soul, towards the settle- 
 ment of his great account, unto whom the bare idea of a 
 slur, on the ermine of his reputation, were worse than 
 death itself, should he, like Martinuzzi, be doomed, for 
 years, to writhe with an exenteration of the inmost mind, 
 lest a single contre-tems shiver to its foundations, the 
 august, and apparently rock-rooted pedestal, his deeds 
 and genius had erected to his fame. 
 
 At length, after a considerable pause of deep thought, 
 Martinuzzi spoke : — 
 
 " You have indulged yourself, my lord, in such intem- 
 perate language," he said, in a hollow, yet more schooled 
 
 * Aristoteles quidem ait omnes ingeniosos melancholicos esse. — Cic.

 voice, than he had before used, " that it would well 
 become my state, not to bandy further terms with you ; 
 but there may be more in this, than meets the ear ; and 
 
 you have hinted, in obscure phrase, at matters that . 
 
 In short, Pereny, is there any thing yet untold, that you 
 would have me infer, from your mysterious and discour- 
 teous address ? Prithee, be plain with me." 
 
 " I will be plain with you, lord cardinal ; it is for that 
 purpose I am here," replied Pereny. 
 
 " Yet, stay," said Martinuzzi, with sudden wildness ; 
 " are we alone, think you ? Silence ! What was it?" 
 
 " Air," replied Pereny. 
 
 " I hate the subject you are upon," rejoined the re- 
 gent ; "but now we are here, and for once, I'll listen. 
 Well, what is it ?" — The tones, in which he spoke, were 
 half suffocated, and yet determined, as if he had screwed 
 up his courage to hear the whole. 
 
 The eyes of Pereny rested with stern significance on 
 Martinuzzi's face, for several seconds, and then, with 
 grave air, drawing his seat nearer to that of his compa- 
 nion, he commenced, in a low, deep, but most articulate 
 voice, as follows : — 
 
 " It is now many years since the late king sickened 
 and died. Those factious nobles, young Maylat's father, 
 and Balassi, confiding in the strength of their strong- 
 holds in this principality, had thrown off, like garments 
 over- worn, their duty and allegiance. On hearing these 
 tidings, his grace, who was then at Buda, followed his 
 army to Transylvania. It may have been the fatigue of 
 his hurried journey — it may have been aught else — 
 enough — he died, as you know, in this very province 
 
 where you now rule; in this city, and I believe " 
 
 Pereny abruptly stopped, and then with his eyes slowly 
 made the revolution of the room. — " Yes, I am right," 
 he added, after a moment's consideration, " even on this 
 spot, where we now confer together, John of Zapola 
 breathed his last."

 The look of Martinuzzi did not quail ; yet a shade of 
 the rose hardly startled the lily on his cheek. For an 
 instant it lasted, and no more. Ere it could be per- 
 ceived, his complexion had returned to its previous mo- 
 numental hue. 
 
 " He was your earliest benefactor," proceeded Pereny, 
 turning full towards Martinuzzi, and looking at him in a 
 very marked manner; "the fast friend of your youth, 
 the advancer and patron of your maturer age ; the man, 
 that first lent a base to your colossal greatness; — to 
 whose bountiful spirit, more liberal than the winds, the 
 stars, the flowers, you owe all, that makes you mightier 
 than men, more grateful, at least, if not more deserving. 
 Swollen as thou art, lord cardinal, canst thou name the 
 thing under heaven, that is precious to thy ambition, whe- 
 ther comprehended in the fruition of fame, or the posses- 
 sion of power, but was first built up in thee, by John of 
 Zapola?" 
 
 Pereny ceased, as if for a reply, but Martinuzzi made 
 no answer. His eyes were fixed on the floor, and he 
 remained still and mute, and apparently as unmoved, 
 and as indifferent to the gaze of Pereny, as a statue 
 hewed out of marble, to which, rather than to a living 
 being, his utter absorption and stirless attitude can be 
 properly compared. 
 
 " In this apartment," went on Pereny, " his grace 
 spent his last breath. I, amongst others, attended his 
 death-bed." 
 
 Martinuzzi hastily, but scarcely, raised his looks from 
 the ground ; the movement would seem to originate in 
 surprise, but it was at once so transient and uncertain, 
 that it left behind a doubt, not only, as to what construc- 
 tion should be put upon it, but even whether it had, in 
 reality, occurred. 
 
 " Luke Swartz likewise was present." 
 
 The brow of Martinuzzi worked ; he wholly raised his 
 eyes, and bent them inquisitively, on those of Pereny.

 After a moment's survey, he dropped his gaze again upon 
 the floor. The magnat pursued the discourse. 
 
 " You may, perhaps, remember, my lord, that, at the 
 time, queen Isabella was confined in childbed, I was absent 
 from Buda, at my baronial castle, near Vissegrade. It 
 was night, or rather, I should say, morning; for the 
 turn was past, — within the week, I purposed returning to 
 the capital, — when the drowsy household were aroused, 
 by a violent knocking at the outer gate, and a single 
 horseman demanded instant speech of me, in a case of 
 extreme importance. The urgency of his manner was 
 such, that he succeeded in obtaining admittance. I was 
 awakened, — the unknown was ushered into my chamber. 
 I received him in bed ; he was wrapped from head to 
 foot, in a long travelling cloak, but his calpac being off, 
 I knew my visitor, the instant I set my eyes upon him ; 
 he was formerly the equerry of the Countess Scsepas; — 
 Luke Swartz, my lord, was the man." The pause that 
 followed was long and thoughtful, on both sides. — 
 Pereny again spoke. " After some little previous parley, 
 Swartz entered upon the important matter, that brought 
 him to my castle. I will now deliver to your eminence 
 the nature of his communication. — 'I have hasted, 
 hither,' he said, addressing himself to me; 'to lay bare 
 to your lordship, being a nobleman of the highest rank, 
 and the greatest influence in Hungary, a monstrous, and 
 unparalleled piece of treason, now consummating, against 
 the king and people of these realms, — ' he paused, — I 
 signed to him to go on. He proceeded to inform me, that 
 a lady of no small consequence about the court, he men- 
 tioned not her name, (and only subsequent events, years 
 afterwards, enabled me to guess at it), was delivered of 
 a female infant, a few hours antecedent, to Queen Isa-

 me, that the bishop of Waradin, was the father of this 
 female; and that, by the skilful offices of the gipsy,

 it was contrived to substitute your illegitimate daughter, 
 in place of King John's issue. Your progeny was palmed 
 upon Isabella for the true heir, whilst the new-born 
 babe was delivered by Unna, into the hands of Swartz. 
 ' The child is already as one of the dead, observed the 
 beldame, since only thou and thy sister, know of its ex- 
 istence. Let it be dealt upon, as you would, that I cause 
 your suit to prosper.' Of the nature of the promise or 
 threat, implied in these words, Swartz made no mention. 
 The equerry added, that your eminence, in well-acted 
 ignorance of these orders, had directed him to convey 
 your child, with an explanatory letter, to our late friend, 
 Count Rodna, the Scottish exile. ' Now,' said the equerry, 
 in conclusion, l I have come to the resolution to be ad- 
 vised by your lordship, what it behoves me to do, under 
 circumstances of such danger and difficulty.' " 
 
 "The villain!" muttered Martinuzzi, under his breath, 
 though, low as the words were spoken, they sounded 
 distinct and audible, on the ears of Pereny. 
 
 " I cannot guess," said the magnat, " whom your emi- 
 nence would stigmatize, with that epithet; — not Luke 
 Swartz, surely, — he did no more than his duty; and, 
 how a man of your sagacity and penetration, came to 
 rely on his proving true to you, whilst false to his king 
 and country, passes my divining." 
 
 " You will favour me, by sparing your remarks," said 
 Martinuzzi, and he drew up his stately form to its full 
 height. " My lord," he proceeded coldly, and in a voice, 
 whose composed and deep organic tones, at such a mo- 
 ment, and after what had transpired, seemed almost 
 preternatural; " you can go forward to the end, since I 
 cannot choose, but hear the full of thy relation." 
 
 " I approach it, sir," replied Pereny ; " it would be 
 hard to conceive my excess of surprise, at what I heard, — 
 it was really so extreme, that for the first few minutes 
 afterwards, Swartz remained unanswered. At length, I 
 found voice to ask, where he had left his infant charge?

 — ' Behold him here/ was the reply to my inquiry; and 
 throwing aside the folds of his cloak, the royal babe was 
 discovered, tranquilly sleeping, on the equerry's arm. 
 There was an eloquence, in the very helplessness of his 
 innocence, that pleaded well, for the son of John of Za- 
 pola ; and I was not long in making up my mind, to bear 
 him to his father. As I knew, that every thing depended 
 upon celerity, what I determined to do, that I commenc- 
 ed putting into execution, within the same hour. In the 
 course of the next, I was on the road to Hermanstadt. 
 Several days elapsed, ere we reached this city, where the 
 tidings, with which we were greeted, overwhelmed us 
 with dismay and chagrin. King John, it appeared, had 
 been at the point of death, for the last two preceding 
 days, and was certainly not expected to survive the 
 night. I succeeded in obtaining a private interview with 
 his grace, in the course of which, I explained every par- 
 ticular. Never shall I forget the horror, depicted on his 
 dying features, at my intelligence. Three or four days 
 had elapsed since, by means of extraordinary despatches, 
 he had learned his queen's accouchement; and even in the 
 interval, between hearing these tidings and our arrival, 
 he had executed, and transmitted to Buda, that testament, 
 which appointed you the guardian of his infant princess, 
 and joint regent with Isabella. I was struck speechless 
 with consternation at such a state of things; whilst John, 
 in feeble accents, demanded to see his child. Luke 
 Swartz was introduced through that door, with the infant 
 under his cloak. Never did a more lovely and promising 
 babe exist. He was held before his royal sire, who, per- 
 ceiving a deep mulberry mark on his left shoulder, bade 
 us both note it well. Then, after some preliminary ob- 
 servations, almost unintelligible, by reason of the broken 
 and faltering speech, in which they were delivered, touch- 
 ing the danger, that must accrue to his child's life, from 
 such vast power and talents, put into motion, by your 
 consummate ambition, were you made acquainted with

 Swartz's betrayal of your treason, — he caused us both 
 solemnly to swear, never to divulge to the world the least 
 particular, connected with his own wrongs, and the ex- 
 istence of his son, until subsequent to the death of Mar- 
 tinuzzi, or, at all events, not before Sigismund was of an 
 ao-e to govern; nor then, unless, in the opinion of both, 
 there should appear a reasonable prospect of his succeed- 
 ing, in establishing his claims. Apprehensive, that it 
 might be needed, I had the precaution to bring with 
 me, to Hermanstadt, the diadem of St. Stephen, and 
 King John, after, with difficulty, writing a few sentences, 
 in relation to the mulberry token on his shoulder, ratified 
 them with his seal and signature. He caused this to be 
 witnessed by Luke Swartz and myself, and posited within 
 the lining, or inner pad of the sacred coronet; and again, 
 having bound us both, by the most solemn oath, not to 
 reveal to Sigismund the secret of his birth, till your 
 eminence's death, or occasion favoured the discovery, the 
 injured king of Hungary went to sleep with his fathers. 
 The infant was conveyed by Swartz, the next day, ac- 
 cording to your first directions, to the chateau of Count 
 Rodna, near Coloswar; and from that moment until 
 this, not a single syllable have I ever hinted at, to a living 
 soul, in respect to this mysterious transaction. T have 
 done; I have at length spoken out, that you may under- 
 stand, how I am armed against you, in case you dare the 
 quarrel. " 
 
 The musing and painful break to their discourse, which 
 followed, lasted several minutes. We will not attempt 
 to depict, since it would be a vain endeavour, the state 
 of Martin uzzi's mind, during the foregoing expose. 
 Even his all-powerful and ever active faculties, fertile as 
 they were in expedients, seemed stunned for awhile, to 
 reflect, that, for years, his treasured secret had been in the 
 keeping of the haughty graf, — that Pereny, from whom, 
 of all men living, he would most have hidden such de- 
 basing transactions, had all along been privy to, what he

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 175 
 
 believed, his treason ; he was, however, far too proud to 
 enter upon a syllable of justification, — he disdained the 
 notion. What! could he descend to make appeal, as to 
 the scales of a balance, casting the charges, to which he 
 had listened, into one scale, and whatever mitigating cir- 
 cumstances were in his power to allege, in extenuation 
 of his conduct, into the other? No; his towering and 
 impatient spirit scorned to have to refute the foul asper- 
 sions of Pereny, and could ill endure being put upon its 
 defence. He had " drank poison," as the graf con- 
 tinued to speak, and, for some minutes after his ar- 
 raigner ceased, he preserved a haughty silence. 
 
 Pereny was the first to resume the topic — " You see 
 my lord, how matters stand," he began : " it is idle to 
 seek to throw dirt in my eyes, by telling me these pro- 
 vinces are yours, by a bull of his holiness, and that at a 
 word, you could get the gift transferred to Czerina, who- 
 ever may be the rightful heir. I neither doubt your in- 
 fluence at Rome, nor your capacity to uphold Czerina 
 on her throne ; but the question between us lies far 
 deeper. I know well, that not for all the territory of earth, 
 would you have this matter made public; — it is not, 
 whether I can prevent your daughter swaying the king- 
 doms of Hungary and Transylvania, but whether I have it 
 not in my power, to strike a blow at that high character, 
 which, to gain the whole world, you would not willingly 
 forfeit, — that is the real point at issue ; nor will I do 
 your eminence's penetration so much wrong, as, on that 
 point, to add one syllable more. Suffice it, — will you stop, 
 my ' making you an astonishment, and a hissing to the 
 nations round about,' at the easy price of the union of 
 Antoine and Czerina." 
 
 Martinuzzi breathed heavily, ere he made answer, in a 
 decisive tone, " I meant you, sir, to read your check in 
 my silence. Let me repeat, however, that with my know- 
 ledge and consent, the Lady Czerina shall never wed a

 villain, and such I esteem the man, you have named." 
 The quiet solemnity, with which these words were uttered, 
 was expressive of a rooted resolution. 
 
 Pereny rose from his seat, with kindling eye and deter- 
 mined gesture — " Enough, sir," he said, " we understand 
 each other. — My course is clear ; I will lay the matter 
 before the assembled states of Hungary, and to embitter 
 the sense, and aggravate the shame of a foreign and 
 usurped rule, I will recount to them, the infamous exploit 
 of him, whose lawless brow, the perpetual zone of regal 
 foreheads, descends, at last, to clasp ; the breathing of the 
 universal wind, the very birds of the air shall carry the 
 matter of Martinuzzi's shame, even to those remotest 
 regions (if any be,) which never heard the tale of Marti- 
 nuzzi's glory." Pereny paused ; his hearer closed his 
 eyes and shuddered. — " I will uplift the curtain, before 
 the astonished world," concluded the magnat. " In place 
 of thy specious virtues, all Hungary, throughout its length 
 and breadth, shall know thee for what thou art, — and as 
 many market-crosses, as are in the land, shall hear the 
 common crier proclaim thee, traitor." 
 
 Martinuzzi started up. There was writ, in the blood- 
 less and haggard calmness of his countenance, an ominous 
 something, too fearful to interpret. Echo answered not 
 sound, more faithfully, than the picture Pereny had drawn, 
 was responsive to his restless, and feverish forebodings. 
 It gave body and voice to the terrors, which, in the soli- 
 tude of his heart, for many years, had haunted his nightly 
 visions and daily meditations, like a spectre. He hurriedly 
 motioned his hand towards his companion, and for some 
 seconds he essayed to speak, but something within struck 
 dumb his voice. " Nay, nay, Pereny," he at length 
 faltered out, " perhaps we may otherwise settle this differ- 
 ence — besides, your oath — your oath to King John, on his 
 death bed." 
 
 " What means your eminence?" demanded Pereny.

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 177 
 
 " Did you not tell me, you promised not to make this 
 revelation, during my lifetime?" 
 
 " That was in case Sigismund had not otherwise a rea- 
 sonable prospect of establishing his rights," returned 
 Pereny. 
 
 " Well, my lord, what prospect can he have ? — a 
 fugitive, and also (which no one can lament more sin- 
 cerely, than I have done,) of unsound mind." 
 
 " Perish your eminence's secret boast !" replied the 
 noble, scornfully. "Despair the vain assumption, — be 
 assured, 'tis false !" 
 
 " False ?" faintly repeated Martinuzzi. 
 
 " False as thyself, misproud prelate ! " rejoined Pe- 
 reny ; " for, since it must be, learn, the unfriended, feeble- 
 minded Sigismund, whom thou hast so irreparably in- 
 jured, is no other, than the redoubtable Richter, Vilez 
 Iwan, the conqueror at Coloswar." 
 
 Martinuzzi sank down upon the seat, he had that mo- 
 ment quitted ; and for the next few moments, covered 
 his face with both his hands. " I should have dreamed 
 of this before," he murmured indistinctly from his hue- 
 less lip ; whilst all the vast and collateral consequences, 
 involved in the information, flowed indistinctly on his 
 brain, like the thousand waves of a troubled sea. 
 
 " Learn further," proceeded Pereny, " the Richter 
 Iwan is now on his march to Hermanstadt, to claim the 
 throne of his ancestors. Within these four-and-twenty 
 hours, I expect, he will summon the city to surrender." 
 
 Martinuzzi altered not his position. 
 
 " My lord, I take my leave," presently said Pereny, 
 advancing towards the door : " and since this misunder- 
 standing cannot be otherwise adjusted — " he paused, 
 for Martinuzzi was already upon his feet, and stood be- 
 tween him, and the point of egress. 
 
 " What's that you say, Pereny ?" he demanded wildly. 
 " You'll not adjust our disagreement ? Ha ! think bet-

 ter of it; — perchance, my lord," he added with a livid 
 lip, whilst a shade of portentous feeling darkened his 
 brow, like a thunder-cloud, and some deep mysterious 
 meaning, that defied expression, seemed to lurk in the 
 more low and indrawn voice, in which he couched the 
 menace ; " perchance it were wiser of you ." 
 
 "Wiser of your eminence, you should say," replied the 
 noble. " Yet reconsider, lest, when your more prudent 
 moments visit you, you have cause to repent your pre- 
 sent precipitance, on finding it impede the march of your 
 true interest." 
 
 " That shall not be, I swear," exclaimed Martinuzzi, 
 fiercely. " Then say, what would you V 
 
 " Marry Antoine Pereny to the Lady Czerina," said 
 the noble. 
 
 " Nor shall that be, either," rejoined the regent, 
 haughtily. 
 
 "Then only this remains," said Pereny. "I have 
 already spoken with Eissenburg ; and shall, immediately, 
 open a correspondence with Iwan. If, ere to-morrow 
 noon, I receive not a favourable message from you, I 
 shall, at that hour, repair to the palace, and instruct 
 Queen Isabella, who is the true heir of John of Zapola, 
 together with every other particular, relating to your 
 reaching machinations. You have my last word ; — let 
 me pass, my lord ?" 
 
 " What, ho ! my guards there !" shouted Martinuzzi, 
 moving a stop towards the door. 
 
 Something like a smile lit up the proud brow of Pe- 
 reny. " You would seek to confine me in vain, my 
 lord," he observed calmly : " there's not a single prison, 
 in this keep, whose secret mode of egress I am not ac- 
 quainted with." 
 
 " I will have you chained hand and foot, Pereny, fet- 
 tered in every limb, but I will keep you," cried Mar- 
 tinuzzi, in a voice of irrepressible wrath. 
 
 " I apprehended your kind intentions," returned Pereny,

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 179 
 
 with provoking composure, " and have not entered these 
 walls a solitary individual ; there are those without, to 
 whom the labyrinth of the vaults are no secret, and who 
 will know how to act, in case I am not forthcoming." 
 
 " I will have a whole corps quartered in your dun- 
 geon, arrogant noble, but you shall be secured !" ex- 
 claimed Martinuzzi, with vehemence. " What, ho ! with- 
 out there !" 
 
 " My lord," returned Pereny, with a sneer, " your 
 might and malice are alike impotent ; but severed snakes 
 will writhe, until they die, — it is their destiny. Think 
 not, I would be slow, in acquainting my guard, unto 
 whom they really owe allegiance. Why, what a con- 
 temptuous opinion must you have of me, to hold this 
 language ! The confession of Alicia, which Eissenburg 
 received back from Swartz, at Coloswar, is now in the 
 possession of one of my people. Think you, that my 
 imprisonment will hinder its being given to the world ? 
 Rather will it accelerate the hour, that lays open that 
 evidence of your treason." 
 
 " I know not why, I forbear poignarding you where 
 you stand !" cried Martinuzzi. 
 
 " 'Twere a crowning deed, and, methinks, were your 
 eminence's wisest course," returned Pereny, scorn- 
 fully. 
 
 At this moment, a party of men-at-arms appeared at 
 the door. The regent looked at them, vacantly, for an 
 instant. " You are not wanted," he said, at last, when 
 emotion permitted speech ; and the room was again 
 cleared. 
 
 " My wisest course, you say" repeated Martinuzzi, 
 with a voice ghastly and hollow, sounding as if sunk 
 within him, and quivering with some deep emotion, from 
 limb to limb : " So — not unlikely /" then, after seeming 
 to ruminate for an instant, he went on ; " but any where, 
 but here, — not under this roof. Fiend ! Devil !" he 
 cried, suddenly altering his tone, to one sharpened by

 passion, and partial insanity. " What a thought thou 
 hast conjured ! Thou hast put fire into my brain, and 
 blood into my eyes. Whatever things I deem, or 
 look upon, blush like a hell. Ha! that gash! — 'tis 
 thine! — ay, thine! Well mayst thou shudder, when 
 reeking forms are round, — but thou thyself! — God, — 
 man ! thou look'st a corpse more crimson than the rest ! 
 — Forbear me." 
 
 " I shall look to hear from your eminence, ere noon 
 to-morrow," said Pereny, sullenly ; and quickly passing 
 his reverend companion, as he spoke, in the direction of 
 the door. 
 
 " You shall not be disappointed, Pereny," replied 
 Martinuzzi, sinking the tones of his voice, to a startling, 
 but almost inaudible whisper. Then motioning the graf 
 from the room, with an abrupt inclination of his head, 
 he moved away. 
 
 "And now," he internally demanded, with vacant 
 gaze, and letting his arms fall listless, by his side, as the 
 door closed upon the form of the magnat, " what is to 
 be done ?" 
 
 The consideration involved in this little question, will, 
 hardly, be deemed of trifling moment, either to the good 
 name, the prosperity, or happiness, of Martinuzzi. It 
 was impossible for him not to see, how they all were 
 doomed to be staked, upon the issue of the next few 
 hours. If ever man prized the unreal bubble, reputation, 
 more than another, even, as would seem, to the extent of 
 sacrificing the substantive rewards of a peaceful con- 
 science, to acquire it : — if there ever was a man, (and 
 there have lived many) prepared to barter the sub- 
 stance of desert, in his own bosom, for its false and 
 fleeting reflection, in that of his fellow-creatures, — it 
 was the individual, the mixed traits of whose noble 
 character, with no flattering, however fond a pencil, 
 we have feebly essayed, throughout these weak and 
 perishable volumes, to depict. We confess our love for

 MANUSCRIPT XXIX. 181 
 
 the theme. We confess the swelling emotions, that 
 overcome us, the closer we contemplate the genius, 
 and (spite of all we have disclosed, or aught that will, 
 anon, be more regularly developed, we will add) the 
 virtues of Martinuzzi. 
 
 That we have not, as we fear, impressed the reader with 
 an enthusiasm equal to our own, must be solely attributed 
 to the imperfection of our pen ; but could we borrow, or 
 steal, for, sooth to say, the motive would almost excuse 
 us, that magic instrument, which writ the tragic tale 
 of Eugene Aram ; how would we transport the reader 
 with love and admiration of the man, whose life, in 
 some of its latter passages, we have undertaken to re- 
 cord ! We might, then, have thrown into shade those 
 failings, which, at least, had nothing in them of what is 
 base, or sordid, but which seem to have been grafted, 
 by human imperfections, upon the best and noblest of 
 human aspirations, and unto which the well-known maxim 
 of Horace, would be, at least, as applicable, as to the 
 trifling blemishes, incident to some master-piece in art, 
 or literature : — 
 
 " Autem ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis 
 Offendar maculis quas aut incuria fudit 
 Aut humana parum cavit natura." 
 
 What, though Martinuzzi's conduct may have been forced 
 out of the right path, by an unhappy concurrence of 
 circumstances, proving too strong for his inevitable 
 infirmities, as a man, benevolence and charity were 
 beating at his bosom. His offences grew out of the 
 finest feelings, which do honour to the human heart ; and 
 that religion, which was, with him, no matter of idle 
 form, but the deep and earnest offering of a sound head, 
 and a tender heart, to the throne of Heaven, must have 
 pleaded with the Author of his being ; and whatever 
 were the pauccB macula which arose, for a time, upon 
 the disk of this bright luminary, we entertain not the 
 shadow of a doubt, but that the mercy of his Creator

 would veil them from the eye of his purity, and that, 
 consumed by the fervour of his repentance, and irradi- 
 ated by his faith, they were never entered up for eternal 
 judgment. 
 
 We have, insensibly, been led into this digression, 
 owing- to the reluctance we feel, at having to depicture, 
 in this place, those darker shades of Martinuzzi's nature, 
 to be wholly without which, were to transcend, or sink 
 beneath, the level of humanity. To strip from our idol, 
 the green bays, that were, at once, for an ornament and 
 a covering ; — to peer into the hidden mysteries of his na- 
 ture, and dash aside, though with no irreverend hands, 
 those fig-leaves, that veiled the peculium of his soul, even 
 from his own shrinking consciousness — this is the pain- 
 ful task, which is now committed to us, as veracious histori- 
 ans, and though we would "nothing extenuate," we see no 
 reason, why we should dwell lingeringly on the theme. To 
 be brief: — the very circumstance of Martinuzzi being so 
 chary of his reputation, urged him on to anticipate, and 
 avert, by some desperate deed, the terrible assaults, with 
 which the tottering fabric of his fame was threatened. His 
 parental love contributed, not a little, to fortify his pur- 
 pose ; so that the most hallowed affections of his nature, 
 became the snare of his soul. 
 
 However strong and vigorous his mental powers, the 
 reader will have hardly failed to remark, on more than 
 one occasion, in the course of this narrative, how trem- 
 blingly, in his nicely-balanced character, they harmo- 
 nised with the vehemence of his passions; and " if," as 
 Lord Shaftesbury observes,* " the strings of the instru- 
 ment, though in ever so just proportion, are strained be- 
 yond a certain degree, it is more than it will bear." 
 The image of slaughter, which his last words to Pereny, 
 more than hinted at, retained its hold, on his inflamed 
 imagination, after the magnat left the room. A smother,

 like the " dunnestsmokeofhell," stopped his breath, and 
 the blood seethed and bubbled in his veins. As thought 
 after thought, like red and weltering billows, rolled with the 
 sound of a rushing torrent upon his brain, he seemed to 
 himself to be tossing on some sea incarnadine ; — his mind, 
 was full of uproar, as if it were made the arena of contend- 
 ing elements. The equilibrium of exquisite feeling, and 
 strong judgment was disturbed ; and it was, we have 
 reason to believe, in a paroxysm of incipient insanity, 
 that Martinuzzi determined upon the assassination of the 
 Graf Pereny. 
 
 " He shall hear from me," he muttered to himself, 
 " ere mid-day, with a passport to the other world — he 
 first, and then Vicchy ; but, first, for Pereny. If. this 
 incontinent slave must needs blab what he knows, — in 
 hell he may. His life has been one game of secrecy, and, 
 now, until the peal of doom, I'd have him lie, unguessed 
 at, hid under charnel-roofs, cut out of marble." 
 
 A horrible expression, sadly at variance with the usual 
 rigid calm of Martinuzzi's countenance, broke out in 
 deep furrows on his brow, ..the agony of an instant 
 doing the work of many years. Thus standing in an attitude 
 of horror, the minute description of which we spare the 
 reader, and which it would tax, even the high powers of 
 Macready himself, to represent,, .with maniac-visage, — 
 eyes inflamed and wandering, and interlocked hands, — 
 Martinuzzi called for his attendants. Emeric came into 
 the room, but instantly started back, appalled at the 
 sight of the passions, that were working in the regent's 
 face. 
 
 " Gracious Heavens ! your eminence !" he ejaculated. 
 
 With a voice hollow, inarticulate and inward, Marti- 
 nuzzi spoke. " Ah ! you may well appear surprised," 
 he cried, and his eyes glared, with a wild and troubled 
 light, as he held up his entwined hands; " but, sir," he 
 proceeded, and a gloomy smile wrinkled his quivering

 lip ; " if the life, tortured within these fingers, make 
 them glue themselves together thus, can I prevent it?" 
 
 Emeric was fearfully shocked, at the wildness of this 
 bearing, so different, from the composed dignity of his 
 lord's ordinary demeanour ; but, on a sudden, as if sen- 
 sible of the terrible impression he had made, Martinuzzi 
 thralled, with his wonted self-tyranny, the demon within, 
 and recovered the possession and command of his mental 
 faculties. He then delivered his orders coolly and per- 
 spicuously, that an eye should be had to the person, 
 who had just quitted his presence, and that, especially 
 towards noon, the following day, the man's movements 
 should be accurately reported to him. 
 
 Emeric signified his obedience, and the regent, having, 
 by a mute gesture, waved him from the room, was left 
 again to the hideous solitude of his own dreadful 
 thoughts. We find it difficult, to accompany Martinuzzi to 
 that dizzy height, where reflection tottered on the brink 
 of distraction. The magnificence of his intellectual 
 powers, his very strength of mind, only rendered the 
 temporary overthrow of his reason, more overwhelming 
 and terrific. We are fain to confess our inability, to 
 paint the awful combat that was fought, on the sublime 
 arena of Martinuzzi's brain, between religion and high 
 moral principle, on the one hand, and the impetuous 
 impulses of his nature, on the other; and we the 
 rather shun the task, since judgment, reeling on her 
 lofty throne, left the imagination only, the fuller scope 
 to revel in delirium. We pass over, therefore, the in- 
 termediate gradation of his madness, and spare the reader 
 the contemplation of a spectacle, more melancholy and 
 more mortifying to human pride, than that of Babylon in 
 ruins. 
 
 One word in respect to Pereny. On his departure, 
 the magnat reflected, with no little surprise, on the 
 eddy and whirlwind of that frenzy, which caused him,

 however resolute his character, to tremble, during its ac- 
 cess, as if he were destined to become its victim. There 
 is ever something of awe, in the very sound, in which deep 
 and concentrated emotion finds voice, and it almost 
 seemed, that Martinuzzi was prepared to consummate 
 the terribleness of his invectives, with the death of his 
 denouncer. 
 
 Pereny was struck aghast, like the Philistines in the 
 house of Dagon, when their ears first caught the prayer 
 of Samson, and beheld the pillars of the fabric in his 
 grasp. Perhaps these images of terror — this first reel- 
 ing of the edifice of his worship was not altogether illu- 
 sory. The instinctive forebodings, which crept, with an 
 icy chillness, through his veins, may have been the ob- 
 scure, and shuddering intimation of his inner spirit, that 
 his hour was almost come ; — but why should we anticipate, 
 and lament calamity before it reach us ?* Alas ! the evils 
 of the day are sufficiently mournful, and painful to elu- 
 cidate. Time rushes onwards like the winter's wind, 
 bearing terror and desolation on his wing. Let us wait. 
 
 ,c What need a man forestall his date of grief ?"t

 It was reported, in the course of that day, that the 
 Richter Iwan, after traversing the country, with his free 
 bands, had pitched his tent, within a short clay's march 
 of the city. Men spoke also, with certainty, of the 
 Turkish armies having quitted the vicinity of Belgrade, 
 and violated the Transylvanian frontiers, and it was even 
 given out, that the Ottoman emperor was with his troops 
 in person. The great Graf Pereny, so long supposed 
 dead, was said to have been spoken with, by several ; 
 and Abu Obeida, the Turkish envoy, must have privately 
 returned to the city ; since he was seen, on the previous 
 night, near the line of tents, erected for the accommoda- 
 tion of his retinue, at the top of the High-street. Each 
 of these rumours possessed more or less interest, for the 
 good citizens of Hermanstadt. But what, perhaps, 
 affected the public mind most deeply, was the circum- 
 stance of the National Diet, which had not assembled 
 for a considerable period, having been convoked by Mar- 
 tinuzzi, to meet him at Coloswar, for the alleged purpose 
 of their legislating, upon the matter of the disappearance 
 of the sacred crown, though, in reality, as was surmised, 
 with the view of having his usurpation of the govern-

 ment of the country ratified, by a regular form and regal 
 title. These various rumours were afloat, throughout the 
 day, towards the close of which, that terrible storm, the 
 like of which had never before been witnessed, in Her- 
 manstadt,* and which had subsided during the night, 
 raged, if possible, with greater violence, than on the day 
 preceding. Being a Wednesday, in the last week of 
 Advent, it was, of course, held as a fast throughout the 
 catholic world, and, at night, high mass was celebrated 
 in the church of St. Theresa, f 
 
 It was on that occasion, that an incident befel, which, 
 in the infallible spirit of subsequent divination, was re- 
 membered, as ominous of the fatal catastrophe of the 
 morrow. As loud hosannas, from the full choir, died in 
 the lengthened aisles, and vaulted roof, at the commence- 
 ment of the dreadful sacrifice, the officiating priest, who 
 happened to be the private chaplain of the cardinal, pro- 
 bably through awkwardness, upset the chalice, and the 
 consecrated element flowed over the altar. All present, 
 grandees, no less than spectators of inferior note, were 
 horrified ;J and a subsequent event, having reflected an 
 extrinsic, and superstitious importance, on the mal-adresse 
 of the priest, it was long before it ceased to be a subject 
 of interesting application, with most of the congregation, 
 among whom, neither the least, in point of rank or beauty, 
 were Queen Isabella and her pale daughter. As the 
 people gazed, in commiseration, on the latter, who, in de- 
 caying youth and loveliness, resembled some exotic, 
 drooping beneath the open skies, they could not prevent 
 
 * A historical fact. 
 
 t We believe, that at the present day, only black mass can be cele- 
 brated after the hour of noon. It must, however, have been otherwise 
 at the date of our tale. We learn, incidentally, from Sir Walter in the 
 beginning of" The Fair Maid of Perth," that the ceremony of high mass 
 was performed in the evening ; but the era was earlier. 
 
 $ "This anecdote proves," says the historian, " that the great in 
 Transylvania, in the sixteenth century, were no less superstitious than 
 those they governed."

 an obtrusive fear creeping to their hearts, that, according 
 to the old superstition,* she was one, too pure, and too 
 beloved of Heaven, for Time to be allowed to heap his 
 sear and withered hours, on her decay ; yet little, did the 
 most apprehensive of that congregation forebode, within 
 how short space of time, the delicate creature, whom to 
 see was to love, and to love to pity, was fated to be sum- 
 moned back, to the home of her nativity. The tender 
 interest, which the appearance of the Lady Czerina na- 
 turally inspired, insensibly became converted to a feel- 
 ing, in respect to her guardian, of no amicable character. 
 Like those sea-monsters of Africa,! that lure children in 
 their folds, to devour them, he had cast his snares, round 
 their young sovereign ; and the citizens of Hermanstadt, 
 ever distinguished for their loyalty, I were not slow, in 
 attributing her evidently declining health, to his purposed 
 usurpation. 
 
 It is ordained, in the very constitution of our nature, 
 that we should wish, 
 
 " To defend against the world,"§ 
 
 to cherish the feeble, and the oppressed ; and if 
 this kind of (rropyr), or sacred instinct of humanity, 
 be called forth, in favour of one, possessing the ad- 
 ditional, and combined claims of youth and merit, 
 royalty and loveliness, it would almost seem, its influence 
 on our conduct must be resistless. It is certain, that 
 under the impression of the moment, regards, of no very 
 gentle description, were showered from all quarters, upon

 the dignitary, who, in his " sacerdotal accoutrements"* 
 of violet satin, f stiffened with golden embroidery, was 
 officiating at the altar. 
 
 A fearful change appeared to have fallen, over the 
 countenance of Martinuzzi, which, combined with an in- 
 explicable wandering, and perturbation of manner, soon 
 converted those glances, already sent in anger, to looks 
 of inquiry and amaze. There was an air of discom- 
 posure about his whole person; — his ordinary dignity 
 and stately self-possession, seemed to have forsaken 
 him,, .supplanted by a humbleness, perhaps more im- 
 pressive ; his usual firm step tottered ; he had grown 
 deadly pale, and the broken and faltering tones, in which 
 the holy service was spoken, sounded very unlike, to the 
 wonted calm, and deliberate enunciation of Martinuzzi. 
 
 When the holy pomp of those impressive rites had 
 come to a close, the cardinal approached the royal party, 
 to interchange such courteous common places, as, in all 
 ages of the world, have been, more or less, in requisi- 
 tion, upon occasion. As conspicuous, with erect fronts 
 and blanched visages, the lord cardinal and the youthful 
 queen looked on one another, the spectators could not 
 but be conscious, — most of them, perhaps, for the first 
 time, — of a powerful likeness between the oppressor and 
 the oppressed. 
 
 Czerina's plastic lineaments, the unerring index of her 
 heart, seemed to give back, with minute and painful 
 fidelity, the worn, and haggard expression, that brooded 
 over the physiognomy of her guardian. Her frame, too 
 delicate for the struggle with her feelings, was rapidly 
 yielding to that secret anguish, which pressed upon her, 
 though her magnanimity endeavoured to conceal it from 
 Martinuzzi. She felt her young spirits wither up, before

 that uncommunicative, stately, but mild dejection, . . 
 that solemn sadness of manner, which, so to speak, 
 sublimed her sense of the inflexible tenor of his proceed- 
 ings. There was a sacredness in his very sternness, that 
 acted upon her, like a spell ; but the still atmosphere, she 
 breathed never thrilled to the accents of complaint, or 
 rather, the very silence of her broken-heartedness, con- 
 veyed the bitterest reproach. 
 
 Oh ! what are we, the creatures of an hour, — the 
 dying, mid a dying world, — how has the Framer of our 
 human nature constituted us, that we should thus in- 
 dulge in harsh and hurtful passion, and take delight, to 
 distress and triumph over brethren, for whom mutual 
 sorrows and a common fate should teach us sympathy ? 
 Why, from the bleak wind of this merciless wide world, 
 is there no shelter, save in the shadow of the tomb ? 
 
 I was struck with a sentiment in Eugene Aram, ori- 
 ginally started by Goethe, and, not long since, fearfully 
 illustrated in the writings, and death of the unfortunate 
 Champavert,* — namely, that not the breast of an indi- 
 vidual breathing, but hides a secret something, which, 
 were it laid bare to-day, would make you abhor him. I 
 know not, if this be strictly true, but of the converse of the 
 proposition, I feel as convinced, as that my pulses beat. 
 If Plato was right, when attempting a definition of the 
 soul,f he termed it a harmony, to which God's own ear 
 listens delighted, sure I am, that, on the diapason of the 
 heart of every human being, some one redeeming note must 
 intrude, — " some minor third, or flat seventh, "| — deeply 
 steeped in, or, at least, like all the fine and hidden sym- 
 pathies of our nature, not unallied to melancholy, which, 
 could it be discerned, in its simple and touching reality, 
 might disarm the bitterest wrath of our fellow-creatures,

 and, amalgamated with a single essential, enforce for-

 gospels of Heaven. 
 
 " Such harmony is in immortal souls ; 
 But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay 
 Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."* 
 
 The look of diabolical, and, as it almost seemed to 
 Martinuzzi, of triumphant exultation, with which Isabella 
 would have fixed him, as with a spear, might only the 
 day before, have pierced through the thick felt that 
 wrapped about his thoughts ; but now, his soul was cir- 
 cumfused in an atmosphere of such subtle and poignant 
 emotion, that no idea, on this side heaven, save owe, could 
 find entrance or subsist there ; — aught else " passed by 
 him, as the idle wind, which he regarded not." He, 
 however, with an instinctive, though unconscious shudder, 
 averted his eyes from Isabella, and cast them, with a 
 long gaze of strong emotion, which blended a variety of 
 feelings, upon the beauteous head of her, who was as 
 dear, and necessary to his life, as the vital stream, that 
 bubbled through the arteries of his heart. Lingering and 
 tremulous was the sigh, that involuntarily heaved up 
 from thence, as he turned to this frail and sentient thins:, 
 the fibres of whose being were so subtlely entwined, with 
 those of the parent stem, that every pang, that shook 
 her bosom, found a responsive echo in his own. 
 
 " Lady," he said, in that low, clear whisper, which 
 never spoke in vain to her heart's sympathies ; " I would 
 have discourse with you to-morrow, as soon as you have 
 done your orisons, — no, towards mid-day ; be you 
 ready to receive me, in your chamber, and alone." 
 
 Like some leaf of poplar, that quivers and turns pale, 
 when a light motion, soft as an infant's breath, steals on 
 the ambient air, shrunk Czerina, beneath the serene re- 
 gard of Martinuzzi. Having signified her acquiescence,

 by a tremulous inclination of her head, she lowered her 
 eyes, and soon after, the prelate, with some customary 
 phrase of benison, passed beyond the grated screen of 
 the chancel, and thence retired, through a narrow door, 
 that privately communicated with the castle. 
 
 The aisles and cloisters of that holy edifice were hardly 
 made more visible, by the mystic and semi-light, which 
 the votive, and scattered luminaries around shed on its 
 sombre architecture. A single figure,.. it was that of a 
 man, and apparently a warrior, would often, during the 
 service, lean earnestly forward, from behind one of the 
 side pillars, that held up the grained ceiling of the church, 
 and which half concealed him in its shadow. This per- 
 son, from some undefined cause, early attracted the at- 
 tention of Isabella. He stood apart from the rest of the 
 worshippers, and it seemed to the queen, that he wished 
 to escape their observation. 
 
 Just as the cardinal was addressing himself to Czerina, 
 this man emerged, from the dim background of the aisle, 
 and crossed to the door, through which the last of the 
 congregation were withdrawing. As he passed forward, 
 he turned his uplifted face, for an instant, towards the 
 escutcheoned gallery, where Isabella sat. In that brief 
 space of time, she obtained a full view of his counte- 
 nance, which she at once recognised, for that of the 
 Graf, Peter Pereny. 
 
 " Tis well ! forewarned — forearmed," murmured Isa- 
 bella, to herself, and, during her passage from the church 
 to the palace, her thoughts were occupied, with respect 
 to the motives, that probably prompted the sudden re- 
 appearance of one, of so singular a character, on the 
 stage of active life ; and she was providently anticipating 
 the various hazards, and preparing, in thought, success- 
 fully to go through that difficult task, which the course 
 of events had chalked out for her. 
 
 By advancing the progress of our narrative about two 
 hours, we arrive at the point of time, when Antoine Fer-

 raro was to give Father Dominick the meeting, beneath 
 the ruinous porchway before described. Mournfully, 
 and slow, swung the deep, sullen clang, of the cathedral 
 bell, on the fierce and sweeping winds, as they creaked 
 over the white and wintry city. Midnight pealed through 
 the serried clouds, and the dense and sensible air did 
 catch, and carry on the warning, along the waste paths, 
 where the ruler of the storm careered at his will. 
 
 As the last stroke chimed away in the vault of distance, 
 the trap-door was slowly raised, and a living form 
 emerged, into the deep obscurity of the dilapidated en- 
 trance. 
 
 " Who art thou ?" demanded the voice of one, already 
 shrouded in the gloom. 
 
 " A man, who hath but lately learned to know him- 
 self," was the response, delivered after a brief pause. 
 
 " Marc Antoine?" again asked the first speaker. 
 
 " The same, — and thou ?" 
 
 " Thy father, boy !" replied Pereny, who had ad- 
 vanced close beside him, and now pressed him to his 
 heart. 
 
 There was a long, deep pause, made sacred by the 
 emotion which produced it. 
 
 " Why art thou silent, Antoine ?" said Pereny, at 
 length. " Do thy feelings overcome thee, or dost thou 
 marvel to recognise these familiar accents ? Tis the 
 black Scipio, indeed, who addresses you, my son, but no 
 less Pereny." 
 
 ". Wonderful !" cried Ferraro. " And your motive 
 for this long disguise, dear sir ?" 
 
 " The time suits not now to explain," replied Pereny ; 
 " did it, I have matter even more important, to unfold. 
 It is of thyself, I have to speak at present: Antoine, thou 
 must pluck thy fatal passion, for the Lady Czerina, from 
 thy heart, — thou canst never wed her." 
 
 Ferraro was silent. 
 
 "Bear the blow, my son, as becomes the high blood of

 Pereny. Martinuzzi is not to be moved — he refused his 
 consent to the union." 
 
 " And is his consent indispensable ?" asked Ferraro. 
 " She is queen in Erdely, and surely may dispose of her 
 hand, where she has given her heart." 
 
 4< My son," said Pereny, placing a folded paper in the 
 hands of Ferraro, " receive this, and when you have read 
 over its contents, you will have conviction, of what I am 
 about to inform you. The Lady Czerina is not the right- 
 ful sovereign of these realms !" 
 
 " What mean you ?" demanded Ferraro. 
 
 " She is not the daughter of King John and Isabella." 
 
 " Not the daughter of Isabella /" echoed Ferraro, in a 
 sharp and piercing voice. 
 
 " Were those words yours, Antoine ? — methought the 
 voice sounded foreign to my ears." 
 
 " Surely none but mine, dear sir, — only explain what 
 riddle lurks in your words !" 
 
 " Be not overwhelmed, my son," returned Pereny, 
 " for it is certain, the tyrant hath authority to prevent 
 you ever marrying Czerina, if, indeed, after what I shall 
 disclose, you should still affect the alliance." 
 
 Ferraro drew in his breath, through his compressed 
 lips. " Proceed," he said, in a low trembling voice. 
 
 " That lady reaches, indeed, at the seat of kings," 
 continued Pereny, " and the world admires her specious 
 rank — deception all the while. — Oh! well may the 
 queen turn coldly from the person of her injury, nor 
 cherish the offspring of the man, who cozened her !" 
 
 " Of whom?" cried Ferraro, as if gasping for breath. 
 " Speak on." 
 
 " Of Martinuzzi," answered Pereny. He paused, for 
 the evident difficulty with which Ferraro drew the vital 
 air, terrified him. " I will not believe thee so utterly de- 
 generate, from the blood and sentiments of thy ancestors, 
 Antoine," he said, " as to be overcome by these tidings.

 " 'Tis nothing," returned the other, in a failing voice, 
 " or 'twill pass away ; but, for God's sake ! say on — to 
 the purpose. Martinuzzi's daughter, you tell me — if 
 you speak, sooth, in the name of mysterious Providence ! 
 who was her mother ?" 
 
 " The late king's sister, of whom you have heard men 
 speak." 
 
 " The Princess Beatrice — I see it all !" screamed Fe- 
 raro ; " I've known as much for years. Omniscient 
 Nature proclaimed the mighty secret. I felt it whisper- 
 ing, working through every sentient fibre of my loathing 
 frame. With all my heart, sense, mind, soul, I could 
 
 have hated ; but gulled fool ! — cozened ! — abused ! 
 
 ha ! ha ! ha! ha !" and shrilly horrible, echoed the laugh, 
 in that lonely spot. " God ! — the weight, you have re- 
 moved from my free spirit ! — what imposition !" 
 
 " Marc Antoine ! my son! — have you lost your 
 senses ?" cried Pereny. 
 
 " Nay," replied Ferraro ; " let me, for an instant, give 
 vent, to my long- smothered feelings, let me taste the 
 pure unadulterated luxury, of being allowed to hate. Oh 
 God!" he continued, in a low deep murmur, " what pro- 
 phets our naked instincts prove, whilst our reasons are 
 but mole-eyed ! That white and meek abhorrence, 
 Martinuzzi's branded bantling all the while ! — I did think 
 as much ! — Now, I thank Heaven for this !" 
 
 " Dear Antoine !" exclaimed Pereny, pressing his 
 hand affectionately, on his son's shoulder; " madness is 
 in thy words — what distraction is it, hath seized you? — 
 Be more a man ! as thou art the heir of my hopes and 
 wishes, be the heir of thy father's firmness also." 
 
 "I will, sir," said Ferraro; but his breath, which 
 heaved thick as he spoke, showed, with what difficulty, he 
 was compelling himself, to assume an appearance of com- 
 posure. " Oh, doubt it not, — 'tis past, — I'm calm ; — 
 what else ?" 
 
 " Not now, my son," replied Pereny, " I can tell thou

 art overwrought, though, wherefore, I hardly guess. We 
 will postpone any further discussion of the subject, till to- 
 morrow — the surprise hath proved too sudden: read 
 that manuscript, which I delivered into thy hands ; I 
 need not caution thee, to be mindful of it ; — its perusal 
 will instruct thee of what importance it must be to the 
 vindication of justice, to keep it safe — from him espe- 
 cially. In the course of this night, or at ec-rly dawn to- 
 morrow, I shall receive despatches, from the Richter 
 Iwan, who is advancing upon Hermanstadt. All is false 
 and hollow, in the position of Martinuzzi. The victory 
 of Coloswar cost the nation dear, in blood and treasure, 
 and its lustre hath been dimmed, by subsequent in- 
 action. The magnats are disgusted — the easy popu- 
 lace are lukewarm, and the nation will shortly be 
 taught to turn their eyes, toward the rightful heir of John 
 of Zapola, as their only refuge in the storm. All things 
 promise success to the holy cause, we have in hand. An- 
 toine, the usurper must be unseated ; but no more, at 
 present ; at mid-day to-morrow, I shall seek an audi- 
 ence of Queen Isabella, when every particular shall be 
 disclosed to her grace, after which, events will reveal 
 their own history." 
 
 " I cannot wait till then," cried Ferraro, in a breath- 
 less eager tone. " What of the rightful heir ? — Who, if 
 Czerina be not, can be the rightful heir of Hungary ?" 
 
 " The son of John of Zapola, and Isabella." 
 
 " The son ! — What is he ?" gasped Ferraro. 
 
 " The Richter Iwan," said Pereny. 
 
 As if a cannon-shot had struck Ferraro, he reeled and 
 reclined his body, apparently lifeless, against the door- 
 way. Pereny, distressed beyond measure, leaned over 
 him. " What aileth thee my son ?" he said. 
 
 An instant sufficed to restore Ferraro, to the use of his 
 faculties, mental and bodily ; he roused himself, and, after 
 a long-drawn sigh, that seemed sensibly to relieve his 
 overcharged spirit, answered, '• Something — a thought

 crossed me, too mighty for belief — it stunned me, for an 
 instant — 'tis over now — I am well. — Great God! how 
 well ! — And is the Richter so near at hand V 
 
 " We'll talk this over to-morrow, Ferraro," said Pe- 
 reny ; " after my audience with her grace, 1 will seek 
 thee here. I trust to find thee stronger nerved at our 
 next interview. Thou art so lately instructed in thy line- 
 age, that thou hast yet scarcely learned to believe thy- 
 self a Pereny, or to think and comport thee, as befits one, 
 of thy long line of ancestry. We rendezvous here to- 
 morrow, and, in the interim, acquaint thyself with the 
 contents of that manuscript : you will there learn — but 
 hark !" he exclaimed, interrupting himself, " are not 
 those voices climbing through the storm ? There's some 
 movement in the city. Antoine, I can remain no longer. 
 — the regent's fear dogs me, like a shadow — I must be 
 wary." 
 
 As Pereny thus spoke, the two left the shelter of the 
 porchway, and emerged beneath the black, inclement 
 skies. All around was wrapt in wreaths of mist ; and, 
 'mid the raging winds, and the frozen vapour, that 
 hurtled by, they hurriedly exchanged congees, and 
 striking into separate paths towards the city, parted 
 company. 
 
 The form of Pereny was seen gliding, through the 
 sheets of driving snow, and even after it vanished, in the 
 dim shades of night, Ferraro paused, and seemed to listen, 
 as if to ascertain the sound of his father's footsteps. The 
 snow, which had been falling all day, lay deep upon the 
 ground, notwithstanding which, as he stood, for a mo- 
 ment dubious, and wrapt in thought, he fancied, more 
 than once, that his ears caught the trampling of a large 
 body of horsemen, — nor was he mistaken. The dreams of 
 the inhabitants of Hermanstadt, on that night, were bro- 
 ken by the clank of weapons and of harness ; and many 
 were the bonncts-de-nuit , thrust out of the opening case- 
 ments, beneath which, peeped forth many a curious eye,

 to witness the inexplicable occurrence of a long troop of 
 men-at-arms, debouching without the city gates. The 
 feeble gleams of starlight glittered, on the armour of the 
 squadron, as it passed through the startled streets. 
 
 Meanwhile, Ferraro turned back, and having again ar- 
 rived at the ruinous demesne, he sought out the spring 
 of the trap-door, and, not to detain the reader with need- 
 less particulars, we present the individual in question, 
 after a few minutes' space, seated at a table, in an inner 
 chamber of Queen Isabella's suite of apartments. The 
 room was lighted up, and the mantle and Spanish hat 
 being thrown aside, who that hath once beheld, that vo- 
 luptuous shape, and those glowing features, can fail to 
 recognise, in spite of all the disguise of her male attire, 
 the Messalina of our tale ? She felt, for all the world, as 
 if her very soul had just been cleansed, and purified, in the 
 Thermse, or hot- baths of Egypt, and that the strenuous 
 ablution, had removed and purged away those noxious 
 obstructions, which, for long, had obscured the finer 
 pores of its "empyreal substance."* With this feeling 
 of renovated existence, did Isabella instantly set about 
 perusing the important manuscript, which we herewith 
 lay before our reader.

 I feel, though no voice hath whispered it, the blanched 
 colour of my cheek, and mark the chill and lazy blood, 
 receding into its customary channels. They told me, 
 they had sent for a holy man, at present sojourning at 
 the neighbouring chateau of Count Rodna, — but, alas ! 
 my few remaining sands are numbered, and unless he 
 hasten, the last minutes in my glass of frailty, will be 
 run down, ere he arrive. So, having consulted with my 
 secret soul, I inscrol the following narrative of a maiden's 
 dreamy existence, and enfeoff to the shrinking gaze of 
 mankind, her feelings and her failings, to serve at once 
 as my self-inflicted pennance, and as some expiation, 
 however unavailing, to the deluded land of my birth. 
 
 " I, and my brother were twins, and being early left 
 orphans, were attached in childhood by the Countess 
 Scaepas, on whose territory we were born, to the regal 
 establishment of their son, then the waivode of Transyl- 
 vania. From my earliest recollection, I was contempla- 
 tive above my years, and sensitive beyond my station. 
 All my thoughts were, so to speak, emotions, and not a 
 single emotion touched my bosom, which, by some in- 
 ternal alchemy, was not transmuted, after a short period, 
 into love. Love made the instinct of my being, the load- 
 stone, which attracted to itself every attribute of my 
 nature. I know not how it may be with other girls, but 
 the rich maternal feelings, I lavished, without exhausting, 
 on my favourite wooden doll, the tender assiduity, with 
 which I cherished the senseless image, I cannot call to 
 mind, even at this final hour of life, without a sigh of sen-

 mine, formed with such capacity, for the enjoyment of

 ing- fast, into the cold tomb, at once so ill-suited to the 
 rude touch of this wrong world, yet endowed with burn- 
 ing capabilities of bliss? Why was this, when all were so 
 many snares to allure me to destruction ? Why was I not 
 gifted with some antagonist strength, to enable me to 
 resist the force of such enervating qualities, as have proved 
 the bane, and bliss of my past existence? Why was I 
 doomed to partake with angels in their glorious privi- 
 lege, if that, which makes the blessing of those regions 
 which I contemplate, is to be the curse of mortality ? But 
 let me not repine, — let me not expostulate with my 
 Maker. Death, the great solver of all that seems beneath 
 the sun, advances with rapid strides, and I feel assured, 
 that that Great God, who made me in his image, and 
 whose mercy is as infinite as his power, hath some mode 
 in store, to redeem his creature, and will not visit hardly, 
 those weaknesses and innate tendencies, which, subsisting 
 under some better modification of being, might have con- 
 stituted my chief merit. Here, alas ! they have proved 
 the source of frailty and of crime, — in heaven, who 
 knows, they may deserve the name of virtues. But, as I 
 was saying, on every thing, that came before me, my 
 childish heart rested in love, — the blossoming tree, or 
 variegated flower, — a horse, dog, bird, the golden fish, or 
 the glittering butterfly, the veriest worm, that trailed 
 its length, before my path, — all things, animate or inani- 
 mate, became, to my deep and gentle nature, a source of 
 that heavenly joy, humanity experiences in loving, — from 
 all, by the alchemy of a creative genius, would I extract 
 the honey dew of affection. I would invent situations, 
 and imagine dispositions and sensations, for the objects 
 of my instinctive fondness. In idea, I could penetrate 
 the thoughts of a rose-bud, or read the heart of the fa- 
 miliar stork, but the favourite bias of my nature, was, 
 dreamingly, to make myself the confident and friend of 
 the ferocious, or venomous denizens of the forest, — to 
 commiserate and sympathize, with what the rest of man-

 kind held in terror or loathing, — to lose my own iden- 
 tity, and herd in thought, with the untamed boar, or 
 crouch, by the side of the spangled viper. I learned to 
 go out of myself, and to live in them; to participate 
 their imaginary joys; to sympathize with their fictitious 
 sorrows; to weep over their abhorred state; and from 
 man's usage, to seek the origin of their peculiar natures, 
 and discover the plea, and palliation for their proper 
 vices. 
 
 " This was a strange propensity for a female, though 
 while that female remained a child, however uncommon, 
 it could scarcely be deemed hurtful ; but as years rolled 
 on, the habitual practice of conjuring up unreal circum- 
 stances, to lament or rejoice over, softened and enervated 
 the heart, till at last, the most minute incident came to 
 be viewed, through a deceptive and gigantic medium, and 
 occurrences, which, from their insignificance, would leave 
 little or no impression upon others, exalted my spirits, to 
 the most buoyant excess ; or, on the other hand, as 
 powerfully depressed them. A word casually dropped, 
 or an inadvertent glance, were sure to be treasured up, in 
 my mind, and when revolved over in solitude, became 
 tortured into a thousand meanings, — the source of what 
 agony, or how great exultation ! — The constant cultiva- 
 tion of the metaphysic faculty I spoke of, had developed 
 my imagination to that degree, that I could at pleasure 
 dive into the secret thoughts of all, who came under my 
 observation. Whether, and how far, I was right in my 
 judgments, I know not, but since I invariably discovered 
 goodness and virtue, lurking in the heart, even if they evi- 
 dently failed to inspire the conduct, of every individual, 
 on whom I tried my skill, I am apt to fear, that the in- 
 stinctive acumen, on which I prided myself, must have 
 been considerably warped and influenced, by that bene- 
 volent solicitude, which led me to descry, with too mi- 
 croscopic a vision, the palliatives of crime, and extenuate, 
 too much, the heinousness of vice. Owing to the goodness

 of my patroness, my education was not neglected, and 
 the stature of my mind, speedily outgrew that of my 
 body. I became versed in history, and delighted, in my 
 solitary musings, to invest the characters of antiquity, with 
 an extrinsic halo, reflected from the false colouring of my 
 own warm heart. By the subtle process, with which I 
 filtered away aught objectionable, human nature stood to 
 my mental gaze, purified from mortal dross. Catiline had 
 a thousand excuses to offer, would Cicero but have heard 
 them, — and Nero suffered a pang, worse than a several 
 death, for every execution, he believed himself compelled 
 to order. One consequence of this lamentable habit of 
 ever finding excuses, gradually became apparent; the 
 distinctive qualities of vice and virtue, were insensibly 
 confounded together; and that indignation, which cruelty 
 and injustice would otherwise have excited in my bosom, 
 was neutralized, by my fatal power of conceiving, at will, 
 palliative or justificatory circumstances, which wholly 
 escaped the more obtuse vision of the rest of the world. 
 
 "Childhood knows no distinction, save of the affections. 
 The Princess Beatrice, Rose Martinuzzi, and myself, were 
 educated together. Our pastimes and studies were in 
 common, sometimes partaken with, or relieved by, the 
 presence of my brother Luke, and of George Martinuzzi. 
 George Martinuzzi ! how, even in this dark twilight of 
 my existence, does my poor heart flutter, as my faltering 
 pen traces the fatal name ! Oh ! why, why in this roomy 
 world, was it ordered, that he, of all men living, should 
 cross my path ? But for that unhappy conjunction, I 
 might have progressed through life to a peaceful grave, 
 without reproach, without misery; I might have become 
 the honoured wife of some patriot chief, the envied mo- 
 ther of a line of heroes ; I might have played the part of 
 Cornelia in Hungary. / am — but no! let me not think

 nion, more frequently with me, than with the princess, or 
 his sister, who neither of them much delighted, in histori- 
 cal disquisition. George was some few years my senior, 
 and considerably my mental superior. The choicest im- 
 pulses of humanity, his heart drank in, with the breath of 
 life, and the sacred past was, to his inspired vision, a 
 fount of deep and prophetic lore, which might serve to 
 regulate the conduct of statesmen, and determine the 
 destiny of nations. Finding me not merely a patient, 
 but a rapt listener, he naturally affected my company, 
 and would daily effuse into my enamoured ears, his choice 
 and precious thoughts, rich with the spoils of many a classic 
 page. From his lips, the simplicity of abstract truth, or 
 the hardness of political disquisition, came clothed with I 
 know not what of radiancy. From examining the diver- 
 sities of political power, and investigating the occult 
 causes of the aggrandisement or decline of nations, he 
 would take occasion to balance the actual interests of 
 the European governments. I believe he considered me, 
 although a mere child, a preferable auditor to the river 
 and the forest ; but he was under no more restraint in my 
 presence, than in theirs, and would give vent to his lofty 
 hopes and feelings in my hearing, in the like unpremedi- 
 tated way, he was wont to do, when trees and waves were 
 his only confidants. Hungaria, and the means of exalt- 
 ing her sons to liberty and knowledge, was commonly 
 his lofty theme : and kings and conquerors might well 
 and profitably have listened to his philosophy, and the 
 luminous genius of a boy would enforce, with earnest 
 ability, his high argument, till conviction, like strong 
 inspiration of truth, fastened upon the hearer's mind. 
 Frequently, and forcibly, would he dilate, on the true 
 policy of King Ladislas,* in his delicate position be- 
 tween two potent empires, affirming, he should prevent 
 either power obtaining a decisive superiority, by never

 joining in too strict relations with either, which were, he 
 said, to make Hungary a dependent province, but by 
 holding both Solyman and Ferdinand at distant amity, 
 and by alternately closing the bands of alliance with one 
 and the other, according to circumstances, to keep the 
 balance even, and thus, by restraining both, make their 
 rival views subserve the interests of his kingdom.* 
 
 " On this and like points of state government, which it 
 was afterwards his destiny to illustrate so gloriously in 
 the face of Europe, would George expatiate for hours 
 together ; and, oh heavens ! I, when life was yet all 
 verdure and freshness, with what entranced and childish 
 admiration, all the while, would I ramble by his side, and 
 hang with glistening eyes upon his every syllable, and 
 every articulation, whilst my loud breathing, snatched 
 during the pauses of his eloquence, alone bespoke my 
 feelings. The cadence of his intermitting voice sounded, 
 on these occasions, like unto Eolian music, heard in weird 
 hours of night and solitude. It seemed as if my own 
 soul were musing audibly, and all that was previously 
 dark, doubtful, and erudite, the rainbow light of his 
 argument flashed clear, on the misty horizon of my brain. 
 And who would suppose, singularly dear as his society 
 was to me, that there could be danger, to a very child, 
 from such close intercourse ? Nor, perhaps, despite my 
 mental interpretation of every movement, and casual word 
 of my companion, was there, while my girlhood lasted ; 
 but the custom we delight in, is not easily broken through, 
 and these outpourings of Martinuzzi's soul were not dis- 
 continued, when the throbbings of my virgin heart inti- 
 mated, but too plainly, how years progressed with me. 
 But to him, it was all the same, and having gifted me, in 
 my purer days, with the false title of his little sister, he

 looked upon me, in that regard, long after I disclaimed, 
 from the bottom of my soul, the obnoxious epithet. Oh ! 
 for me, with more than the due allowance of that state of 
 feeling, which nature herself apportions to a female, grow- 
 ing towards, and just entering, the estate of womanhood — 
 for me, to hear him, in all the confidence of that inno- 
 cent relationship, unburthen his ambitious soul !— to 
 become the manuscript, in which he laid bare his inmost 
 thoughts, that they might rule and regulate mine own ; — 
 to follow the peculiar train of his ideas, only to be led, 
 by the like impulses ; — to comprehend his noble nature 
 so intimately ; — to sympathise so deeply as I did, with 
 all his aspirations; — to note those minuter characteris- 
 tics, which escaped common perception; — to glow and 
 pant beneath his kindling breath, and discern, in the same 
 man, at once the brilliancy of consummate genius, and 
 the confiding tenderness of infancy, — a tenderness, whose 
 exquisite emotions ran alongside, with the elevation of his 
 sentiment; — to think, feel, understand all this, in every 
 fibre of my sentient frame; — to know how worthy, in 
 every way, he was of woman's idolatry, and all the while 
 tremble in his sight, lest he should penetrate the thrilling 
 secret, that dissolved my soul, and wasted my body; — 
 this, day after day, and night after night, a burning suc- 
 cession of hours, was the occupation of my passionate 
 heart, during the vernal development of my youth. He 
 set my whole being in a state of restless excitement, and, 
 like Fame, was an object of desire, placed out of the pos- 
 sibility of fruition. He was unto me as some god, and 
 every lovelier sight and sound of the teeming earth or 
 the siderial heavens, would talk to me of George, or were 
 only marked, as they reminded me of him. All material 
 objects that did not, in their sublimity or their loveliness, 
 tell a tale to my soul of Martinuzzi, were, so far as I was 
 concerned, as though they were not. Indeed, the melan- 
 choly grandeur of our retreat was not unsuited to those 
 romantic illusions, which insensibly incorporated them-

 selves, as it were, with the substance of my mind. Mag- 
 nificence ever affects solitude, and the residence of the 
 Countess Scsepas was a venerable pile, couched and se- 
 questered in her lap. There, eternal nature reigned over 
 the huge and hanging woods, and pervaded their brown 
 and solemn shadows ; the deep blue lake, retired in the 
 wild and rocky dell, was a scene to gaze on with delight. 
 The sylvan haunts of my childhood — their winding paths, 
 picturesque brooks, and nameless rivulets, unwarred on 
 by tasteless wealth, and unembellished by fastidious re- 
 finement, were coeval with the hills they skirted, and 
 virgin from the hands of their Creator. But to return. 
 Other girls, probably, in the like situation, would not 
 have guessed what ailed them, till they had celebrated 
 many more anniversaries at the altar of life ; but it was one 
 natural consequence of my visionary peculia, to anticipate 
 that climacteric, and I had not been so long accustomed, 
 to pierce and analyse the most hidden thoughts, in the 
 breasts of others, without my eyes also becoming gifted 
 with a vision, to penetrate the secret of my own nature. 
 That melting expression in my face, and the palling 
 sweetness of my voice, which I had heard people praise, 
 were the outward development of my extreme suscepti- 
 bility. I knew, that if ever maiden loved truly and fer- 
 vently, I did ; but this knowledge, instead of inclining 
 me to evite all occasions, which might, in any wise, con- 
 tribute to my fatal prepossession, had a very contrary 
 effect. The bands which bound me appeared, in this 
 cherub dawn of young passion, a wreath of perennial 
 blossoms ; — I hugged them to me, till, one by one, the 
 fair leaves of hope and promise dropped aside, and the 
 cold iron, they once concealed from sight, struck the 
 dullness of death to my bosom. But that was long 
 after, and for years I cultivated, with all my care, the 
 deadly weed, that sprang up in the rich soil of my heart ; 
 I found it so unalloyed a pleasure, in the early stages of 
 my fascination. Tis true, the affection, that reigned in

 my bosom, being unacknowledged, met with no requital ; 
 but, viewing George, at that time, more like the phantom 
 of a youthful wish, than a human being, I was so weak 
 as to believe I needed none. I had lived, from my ear- 
 liest recollection, in the fairy fields of visionary fondness, 
 of course without having met with any return ; for what 
 reciprocity of feeling could exist between me, and the 
 dumb or inanimate things, on which I was wont to lavish 
 the romantic tenderness of my nature. My love inva- 
 riably took its rise from the pure, simple, unadulterated 
 joy, I experienced in loving, and my present dream of 
 bliss moulded itself, in conformity with the propensity of 
 my mind. 
 
 u Oh ! if to transmute my being* into a bird or plant, 
 — to penetrate, in fancy, the peculiarities of its species, 
 with the view of attaching myself the closer to some 
 soaring eagle, or rare plant of craggy fount, — if this 
 constituted the darling impulse of childhood, who can 
 form a conception of the exquisite enjoyment, that for 
 long I tasted, without interruption or alloy, when, in 
 the primal excitement of sense, I made man my argu- 
 ment? and, in those indolent reveries, which were so 
 dear to my silent temperament, analyzed and conned over 
 the character of one, who, in all he said or did, won on 
 the affections, and who, according to the credulous be- 
 lief of a fond girl, presented in himself, the most choice 
 specimen of humanity, that ever walked God's earth ? 
 
 " But this could not last for ever, and I, at length, 
 began to apprehend, from my involuntary tremors in 
 George's company, — from my restlessness in his absence, 
 and utter indifference to the major part of the objects 
 around me, — from my voluptuous sleeplessness o'nights, 
 and, more than all, from the wild and lawless wish, — 
 the too unequivocal language of my dreams, that a

 maiden could not attach herself to a human being, with 
 the same sinlessness and placid emotion, with which she 
 loved a bird, in her pure childhood. 
 
 " This fatal truth, which I was slow in ascertaining, 
 was only put beyond doubt by an occurrence, which 
 happened to me in my eighteenth year, and which, for 
 the better understanding of my unhappy story, I shall 
 proceed briefly to relate. 
 
 " The waivode was accustomed, during his relaxation 
 from state affairs, to sail in a splendid boat, he had 
 brought for the purpose from the banks of the Duna, 
 upon a lake, which was but a small distance from his 
 mother's castle. George and my brother would com- 
 monly accompany him, and, occasionally, the Princess, 
 Rose, and myself would join the party. I never received 
 any great gratification from these aquatic excursions, — 
 they were incompatible with those unreserved communi- 
 cations, with George, which I esteemed my dearest pri- 
 vilege. At no period of my life, could my disposition be 
 called social; — my enthusiasm and fallacious delights, 
 which were of too visionary and delicate a character, for 
 participation or control, untuned my mind for rational 
 converse. Every sentiment of my nature, and every 
 feeling I indulged in, was a monopoly, and abhorred 
 communication. From the rudeness of human inter- 
 course, would I habitually retire to the family of my own 
 thoughts, and, whether I found them winged, for hea- 
 venly contemplation, or wrapped, in the weeds of earthly 
 sorrow, they alike incapacitated me for this world's bu- 
 siness. In other respects, I was unfitted for social life ; 
 — I refined on every circumstance too much, and viewed 
 all things, however indifferent, after a mode of my own, 
 and with too critical an eye. The native solitariness and 
 sensitive temper of my soul, was put to continual pain, 
 in the company of unsympathizing friends. I was too 
 alive to the slightest variations of treatment, felt so 
 acutely the least slight, and was too seemingly artificial,

 in all I said or did, to accommodate myself to the con- 
 venances of society. My thoughts ran not in the ordi- 
 nary current, so neither could I endure a conventional 
 tone of conversation. Trifles, which to others would be 
 light as air, would prey upon my spirits, like the cor- 
 roding cancer; — I was always in extremes. Where I 
 was not wholly indifferent, I was commonly so deeply 
 interested, that I feared to trust myself to open my lips, — 
 for well I knew, my slow and sparing hyperboles, and 
 enthusiasm, must appear affectation to those, who could 
 not enter into my feelings. My intellects, in fact, were 
 too masculine for my sex, my heart too eccentrically in- 
 fantile for my age; so I would commonly sit, distant and 
 abstracted, as if some cold spell had chained up my 
 tongue to silence, and that the whole vocation of my 
 soul were endless reverie. 
 
 " Such rooted habits constituted as uncompanionable 
 a character, as can well be imagined ; but, however con- 
 centrated, and sombre my spirits, there was nothing, in 
 reality, sullen in my reserve; and little did they, who 
 thus beheld me, and doubtless turned away, alienated by 
 my chill and unsociable deportment, — little did they 
 dream, what a soft, doating, affectionate heart belonged 
 to that solitary and affected creature, they half despised, 
 half hated; — little deemed they, what inextinguishable 
 passion kept its fierce revels and tumultuous sabbath, 
 under the snowy chillness of that virgin robe ! How 
 could they guess at the cataract, the incessant foaming 
 of the waters, beneath the crust and frost-work of reserve, 
 in which I was driven to glaciate my nature ? Fre- 
 quently have I been accused of want of feeling, owing to 
 that apparent indifference, which, in truth, was only a 
 proof of an excess of sensibility. 
 
 " On the occasions, to which I have alluded, I usually 
 sate silent, and duly remote, from every one, at the stern 
 of the vessel, watching, with side gaze, every stir of my 
 friends, and every movement of the vampire of my heart.

 On one of these expeditions, the dove, that nestled there, 
 was surprised and scared, by the sudden visit of a new 
 and unwonted feeling, which, like a viper, crept into my 
 bosom, as I beheld Martinuzzi engaged, in low and close 
 converse, with the Princess Beatrice. My love for 
 George was the only selfish passion, I ever indulged in, 
 but that was intensely, wholly so ; and it was torture 
 for me to witness another sharing in that confidence, I 
 had insensibly accustomed myself to consider my sole 
 right and property. I immediately endeavoured to dis- 
 cover, what they could be about. My tact in such mat- 
 ters, from long and frequent use, bordered on the mar- 
 vellous, and my sense of hearing, like that of most 
 sensitive people, was remarkably acute. I inferred, from 
 the scarce perceptible direction of their eyes at intervals, 
 towards where I was stationed, that I must be the sub- 
 ject of their discourse. This whetted my curiosity. Pre- 
 sently I distinguished the words, ' amiable' and ' sensible ;' 
 they issued from the lips of Martinuzzi. Oh, how my 
 heart bounded, and my eyes sparkled, at his praise ! 
 
 " l Say what you will, I cannot help my forebodings,' 
 remarked the princess, after a pause. I was baffled ; — 
 to what could that observation refer ? I rapidly turned 
 it over in my mind — to no purpose ; so I laid it by, to 
 be revolved over at leisure, while I bent every faculty to 
 catch something further, that might explain its purport, 
 by implication. I arose from my seat, trod the deck 
 for a few paces, and then reclined my head over the 
 side of the vessel, considerably nearer than at first, to 
 the spot, where the beings, who irresistibly compelled 
 my surveillance, were conferring. Meanwhile, unob- 
 served of most of us, the face of the heavens above be- 
 gan to alter ; — a squall had come down from the moun- 
 tains. It blew a hurricane ; but no combustion of the 
 elements could, 1 believe, have diverted my attention for 
 an instant ; and it might be augured, from their intent 
 attitude and mutual abstraction, that the objects of my

 earnest, though oblique regard, were equally unmindful 
 of the sweeping storm. 
 
 " Some minutes elapsed, before either again broke si- 
 lence, or, at least, until I could apprehend what was 
 spoken. The voice I next heard was that of the princess. 
 1 Then even let it be so,' she said, more clearly, if not 
 more audibly ; ' I confess, I could have wished it other- 
 wise, but, since you hold her so dear, and you ought 
 certainly, by this time, to understand her disposition, I 
 will myself, to-morrow, open the matter to her.' 
 
 " George made some response, in his previous under- 
 tone, when, at that moment, the gilded vessel, in which we 
 stemmed the swelling surge, struck with violence upon a 
 rock, and the whirling water rushed instantaneously, 
 through the disruption of the planks, with irresistible 
 rapidity. A scene of uproar and confusion ensued, that 
 baffles description, — the hurry ings to and fro, — the si- 
 multaneous consternation, — the quick sharp succession of 
 shrieks, as the alternating billows dashed over the deck, 
 and one after another immersed the crew, in its remorse- 
 less tide; — all was the frightful history of little more than 
 a minute. Notwithstanding the perils, with which I saw 
 myself surrounded, I was never more calm and collected 
 in my life, and not only so, but never half so supremely 
 blessed. Not the loud crash, — not the heart-rending 
 yell, out-voiced and hushed at intervals, by the roaring 
 wind, and the boisterous waves, rang on my ears; but the 
 soft murmur of Beatrice's voice, the delirious words, — 
 since you hold her so dear, — stilled my bosom to a state 
 of halcyon serenity, while all around spoke death , and 
 uproar. At the time of our accident, we were scudding 
 along, at no great distance from the beach, and most of 
 the company, trusting to their expertness in swimming, 
 leaped overboard. Some few, however, determined to 
 keep by the boat, till she should split, probably, with the 
 desperate hope of clinging for safety to some broken 
 plank, which the storm might drive on shore. The noble

 waivode, at the instant of the vessel's striking, had 
 rushed, to where the princess was seated, and with her 
 braved the drowning waters. Almost at the same point 
 of time, George threw aside his outer vesture, and fold- 
 ing his sister in his strong arms, plunged with her, into 
 the waves. With anxious interest, I watched the dear 
 swimmer for awhile, buffeting the tempestuous element. 
 I was left to die, but, persuaded, from my own feelings 
 towards him, that my very memory would be more dear 
 to Martinuzzi, than all else left to him on earth, how- 
 ever precious, I awaited my impending doom, patiently 
 at least, if not with content. Absorbed in these reflections, 
 it was not until after some minutes, that the thought of 
 my brother suddenly crossed my mind. I looked around, 
 with a half-uttered exclamation. He was standing be- 
 side me, in an attitude, expressive of speechless, hope- 
 less horror, — he could not swim. I turned to him, and 
 addressed him in as soothing, consolatory terms, as I 
 could: he would not be comforted, — he was in despair. 
 
 "<Oh God! oh God!' he would exclaim; <I shall 
 drown, — go to the bottom ! Is there no hope? None, 
 Alicia? must we both die? — so young too ! Oh God! oh 
 God!' 
 
 " I gently bade him confide in the mercy of Jesus. 
 Foolish girl! to think it was religion, that solemnized 
 my own soul to peace. Alas ! it was love, and love 
 alone, that lapped me in a serene atmosphere, above the 
 feelings, and the fears, natural to my sex, and to ordi- 
 nary humanity. While I was still busy, in essaying to 
 inspire Luke, with a portion of my own false courage, my 
 eye suddenly rested on the figure of a man, struggling 
 against the waters, with lusty sinews, not towards land, 
 but back to the leaking vessel. I looked hard, — oh that 
 throb of my heart! the intrepid swimmer could be no 
 other. I was not mistaken, — Martinuzzi shortly again 
 stood upon the deck.

 " ' I come, my little sister,' he cried, ' to bear you 
 back to safety. Will you trust yourself to my skill?' 
 
 " I replied only with a look, — he approached, — life 
 was dear to me; never more so than at that moment, — but 
 I thought of my brother. My whole manner must have 
 bespoken my irresolution. 
 
 " 'Oh save me, — save me!' entreated Luke; ' leave 
 me not to perish.' 
 
 " George made no answer. I turned to him, and 
 earnestly seconded my brother's pleading. 
 
 "' No, dearest Alicia!' he replied, after a pause of 
 surprise, rather than of doubt; 'this must not be, — the 
 present opportunity is yours, but I make no doubt, there 
 is yet time, to preserve your brother's life also.' 
 
 " ' And will you return to save me?' demanded Luke, 
 grasping George's hand ; ' only do so, and I will be your 
 slave for ever.' 
 
 " ' I pledge you my word, I will return," answered 
 Martinuzzi, but if you detain your sister any longer, I 
 may return too late.' 
 
 " ' Then go, Alicia,' said Luke, waving me from him. 
 I waited not a second bidding, but let the being, I loved 
 with such unutterable devotion, clasp me round, in his 
 dissolving arm. Oh the exquisite sensations I must not 
 think of! — the thrilling consciousness, that made the ely- 
 sium of the next ten minutes ! They were worth an immor- 
 tality of ordinary existence. Not those billows, which 
 seemed broke loose from all control, bounded more riot- 
 ously than did my heart. But I dare not now dwell upon 
 that tumultuous swim, since, the source to me of many 
 cherished, and darling ruminations. Enough ; too soon the 
 impetuous waters of the lake were breasted, — and George, 
 as he consigned me over to some of the attendants, ob- 
 serving my eyes closed, and my cheek as pale as death, 
 imagined me insensible. Would that I had been, — but 
 every principle of my nature was but too alive ! ' poor

 child!' ejaculated my preserver, in a piteous tone, as he 
 hung over me for an instant, and then pressed his ripe 
 red lip to mine. What all the danger and mental terror 
 of the last half-hour, had failed in effecting, that intoxi- 
 cating kiss accomplished in an instant, — it thrilled 
 through my bones, with electric facility. One minute 
 I gasped for breath, and then, faintly smiling, swooned 
 away. 
 
 " The waking dreams of the following twelve hours, 
 are never to be obliterated from my memory. For my 
 own life, and that of my brother, I was indebted to George 
 Martinuzzi ; — the bravest, the dearest of men! — They 
 had borne me to my couch, and having caused me to 
 swallow a composing draught, left me to repose ; the 
 potation indeed, acted as an opiate on my senses, but it 
 did not put me to sleep ; — how could I sleep ? How could 
 I exchange, for the balm of present oblivion, the too se- 
 ductive circumstances of the past, and my vague gilded 
 glimpses into the future? How could I forego the extacy 
 of recalling to mind, every minutise of those maddening 
 minutes, when I hung by my deliverer with the gripe of 
 fate, — or, what was as strong, of love ; and when the 
 brawling surge, and the wild winds only acted as an ex- 
 citement, and served to excuse my clinging all the closer, 
 to his athletic frame. How could my thoughts cease to 
 revert to that electric fire, which ran through every fibre, 
 and every articulation of my body, as Martinuzzi pressed 
 his lip to mine? How, above all, could I consent to lose, 
 in the forgetfulness of slumber, the blissful visions, which 
 the few words of the Princess Beatrice opened to my 
 view, — ' Since you hold her so dear!' A thousand times 
 did I repeat to myself the soul-ravishing sentence. But 
 ever and anon, I would flog my wits, in the vain hope 
 of anticipating the communication, which the princess 
 was to make to me on the morrow. All at once, as I 
 was going the round of conjecture, the electric thought 
 shot through my brain, that it had relation to Martinuzzi,

 MANUSCRIPT XXX. 215 
 
 and that he had confided to the princess, the fact of his 
 passion for her handmaid, and had solicited her interest 
 with the Countess Sceepas, and her gentle offices, in break- 
 ing the matter to myself. For some minutes after this 
 fond hallucination crossed me, I was like one entranced, 
 my heart palpitated, my bosom heaved, an insensible 
 dew distilled itself, through every pore of my glowing 
 body; I lay still and motionless, dissolved in the calm 
 of reverie and sensation. A deep feeling of tranquillity 
 stole over me, — it was not content, it was more ravishing; 
 it was rather like an emanation from Heaven, as if the 
 spirit of pure angelic bliss had descended on my soul. 
 For hours, I remained in this state of soft, still, beatic 
 passiveness, unable to bring my thoughts into any conse- 
 cutive train, through very thoughtfulness. But to that 
 first night of paradisaical felicity, — that last of peace, — let 
 memory no longer recur. It past; the day breathed fresh 
 again, and I was walking on the ramparts of the castle, 
 when the princess, as I had expected, joined me. The 
 horrors of the preceding day naturally formed our first 
 topic of discourse, which presently turned on that indi- 
 vidual, who, like an interveuient angel, had saved myself 
 and my brother from a watery grave. Anticipating the 
 disclosure of her highness, and confused in some measure, 
 by my remembrance of the past night's voluptuous re- 
 verie, a strange embarrassment came over me ; my lip 
 quivered, my tongue faltered, as I attempted to express 
 my sense of George's services, and I was only recalled to 
 myself, by observing to my surprise, that the princess 
 appeared to have lost her wonted self-possession, even 
 more utterly, than I had mine. 
 
 " ' Exactly so, Alicia,' she continued more intelligibly, 
 after having delivered herself for some time, with no little 
 incoherency. * He is as you say, every way deserving of 
 our esteem — of love, and, since we are on the subject, I 
 would entrust a circumstance — a secret to my dear friend, 
 that it is a matter, nearly concerning Martinuzzi,

 and — ' she hesitated — my breast, heaved with expectation 
 - — my eyes glistened with my secret thought — my breath 
 was stifled by the swellings of my heart — I felt my face 
 burn like fire, and my blood circulate with a brisker 
 flow — ' and myself,' concluded Beatrice, her fine counte- 
 nance all of a glow. I started back in amazement and 
 despair; the blood receded to my heart: 'And your high- 
 ness !' I faintly ejaculated, with a voice, lost in the throb 
 of astonishment. ' Alicia !' exclaimed the princess, in 
 accents, that will never die away from my remembrance, 
 at the same time reverting her face, and enfolding in her 
 palm, scorching as heated coal, my bloodless hand. 
 ' He, who yesterday saved your life, and the being, who 
 now addresses you, have long been mutually attached. 
 It were vain hoping for my mother's consent to our union, 
 so we do not intend asking it, — but during the countess' 
 absence from the castle, we purpose being privately 
 married. It will be requisite, there should be witnesses 
 of the ceremony, and George has pitched upon yourself 
 and brother, as being individuals, whom we both prize 
 most highly, and in whom we can securely confide, to be 
 present at our espousals. Will you, dearest Alicia, 
 oblige your old friend and playmate, in this matter ; will 
 you V — and the princess ventured to raise her eye to mine. 
 " ' Holy Mary !' she abruptly demanded, ' What ails 
 you, child V — What ailed me ! I was pierced to the heart 
 — pierced by the words, as with a two-edged dirk. I 
 uttered not a syllable, but sank down lifeless at her feet. — 
 Though I long remained under this suspension of existence, 
 I at length awoke again to the cares, and the duties of this 
 changed, and disenchanted earth ; but from that hour, I 
 date the end of all, that constituted the zest of life. The 
 innocent freshness of my day-dreams was past — how ill 
 exchanged for the racking, stinging, illusive joys, which a 
 too susceptible imagination was capable of substituting ! 
 The witchcraft, by which my soul was enabled to live, in 
 another being, and identify itself with all his thoughts,

 and his feelings, was defeated ; the enchantment that 
 made the occupation of my heart was gone, dissolved, like 
 some aerial frost-work of 'the night, in the rays of the 
 morning sun ; but from the first, I never, even in a pass- 
 ing thought, accused Martinuzzi of my misery. That 
 christian propensity, which formed so prominent a fea- 
 ture in my character,, .the microscopic eye, with which I 
 was accustomed to search out, and invest with a factitious 
 importance every circumstance, however minute, that 
 might palliate the enormity of guilt, proved at least so 
 far beneficial, that it taught me, how to do justice to the 
 innocent. I felt, that George had never entertained the 
 shadow of a suspicion of my partiality for him. Well, 
 time, — which, whether on lagging or light pinion, accord- 
 ing to mortal apprehension, will pass — rolled on, and 
 brought the hour at last, in which (it was about a week 
 subsequent to the communication above narrated,) the 
 princess and Martinuzzi stood before the altar to be 
 united; I, and my brother were present. Of vhat 
 occurred at the ceremony, I can tell nothing. How I 
 preserved the outward mask of consciousness, I know 
 not ; I felt a film gather before my eyes, till all objects 
 floated in a dim and nightmare mist ; there came a 
 rushing sound in my ears ; my senses reeled ; but though 
 I was hardly able to support or guide myself, I did not, as 
 I every instant apprehended I should, drop down a corpse 
 upon the pavement. I retained, to the end, the horrid 
 composure of outbreathed despair, and not ti 1 I turned 
 the key in the lock of my chamber door, that night; did I 
 give vent to my pent-up feelings. That night ! — the 
 bridal night of George ! Oh, that the remembrance of 
 its sympathetic, illicit, its fallacious transports, its into- 
 lerable torments would fade into eternal oblivion ! — but 
 no, while one thought exists within this brain, and one 
 pulse beats within my mortal frame, it is not to be obli- 
 terated. Years roll on in vain, no time can wipe away the 
 emembrance of how I passed that conscious, sightless

 night. Jesus forefend ! that the approaching gasp of 
 death be not a sigh of desperate desire, and that in the 
 dark bourne, whither I am hastening, the recollection of 
 my madness when alive, do not haunt me, and constitute 
 the dreadful penalty of my crimes.* The next morning 
 I was raving ; I had been seized with a brain fever, and 
 to my intellectual eye, the bright sun became obum- 
 brated, and the moon was either lost in her void and in- 
 terlunar circuit, or else beamed through the night, with 
 rays incarnadine. From this awful state I did not recover 
 for many weeks. While I was yet unconscious of all 
 external circumstances, the countess returned to the 
 castle ; she visited my chamber, and, it seems, shortly 
 divined, from my flighty and heart-rending exclamations, 
 the nature of my malady, and ascertained the astounding 
 fact of her daughter's nuptials. The countess was a 
 woman of great decision. Ere I quitted my sick cham- 
 ber, she had, by dint of deep manoeuvring and extra- 
 ordinary conduct, effected the separation of the new- 
 married couple. Martinuzzi had become a monk of the 
 order of St. Paul the hermit ; and the princess, unhappy 
 lady ! was in a condition, little less lost and pitiable, 
 than that, out of which I had just emerged. From this 
 period, I would leap over some few years. 
 
 " John of Zapola, at the point of time I again solicit 
 the attention of the reader of this memoir, was elected 
 to the throne of Hungary, and, shortly after his acces- 
 sion, the Countess Scapas died. Mindful of their former 
 friendship, the king employed his mother's protege in 
 several important negociations, and the first rounds of 
 that ladder, which hath, at this day, conducted Marti- 
 nuzzi to the topmost height of fame, were already scaled. 
 John had taken, for the partner of his throne, Isabella 
 of Poland. The Princess Beatrice resided under the 
 palace roof, and I was retained near her person, rather

 as her friend and confidant, than in any meaner capacity. 
 Her mother's arbitrary proceedings, on discovering her 
 marriage, had, irreparably, shattered the princess's in- 
 tellects. This circumstance, combined with the difficulty 
 of Martinuzzi's having taken ecclesiastical vows, induced 
 him to postpone the acknowledgment of their union, but 
 the mutual affections of the lovers continued unabated, 
 and, at seasonable periods, it was my appointed task to 
 contrive their sabbath-nights of intercourse, which, how- 
 ever hallowed by their exclusive loves, were to me 
 
 And I still loved George, though with an anguished and 
 consuming love ; my passion contracting, in some name- 
 less way, a new zest and an appropriate piquancy, from 
 the insuperable barrier, which fate opposed to its proper 
 gratification. Every smallest air that blew from him to 
 me, came redolent with scents of Araby. To creep unno- 
 ticed to his side, and touch his person as he passed, or 
 the ground, he had hallowed by his tread ; to study all 
 manner of kindly offices, that I might elicit his ineffably 
 soft smile, and urge his plaintive voice, made the sick 
 and miserable delight of my days ; and suspiring his 
 name by stealth, like a spell of power, to bring him to 
 my mind, in the weird and double silentness of moonlight, 
 the ineffable charm of my lorn nights. It were hard to 
 say, whether I were more ruined by the adultery of my 
 imagination, in his society, or by my senses running riot, 
 with the materials of memory, when he was away from 
 me. What, to me, were the externals of time and 
 place? — they mattered not; if I shut my eyes, I could 
 let my thoughts loose in imagination, and gaze on the 
 picture at my core. I bore about with me, his fatally 
 seductive image every where. What though long cor- 
 ridons intervened between us, we could interchange soft 
 prattle in flatteries of the night, while I would delude 
 myself into being the delight, — the choicest, chiefest 
 possession — of the man I loved. I pined, wasted with 
 a soft oppression at my heart, in fond thought of his

 witching form — his heaven-descended aspect — his bright, 
 bright eyes. And yet it was not that : his virtues were 
 also the objects of my affection ; and were his mind 
 not so lovely, methinks, I had not been so lost, — I had 
 not been that feverish, visionary, guilty idolatress, whose 
 daring length of indulgence hath brought her, step by 
 step, to that dark precipice, over which her lightning 
 soul now hovers, ere it vanish, ere the night of the tomb 
 involves her in its shadows. 
 
 " The course of my narrative has now led me to the 
 era of that crime, which makes the dreadful burthen of 
 this confession. My pen trembles, — my heart fails me, — 
 shall I go on ? Oh my dear father-land ! shall I expose 
 thy regent's blood-guiltiness ? Shall I hold up to the 
 light of day, his treasonable practices? — his! — Marti- 
 nuzzi's? Is there no way of shunning this penance, 
 merciful Jesus ! Be still, my dying soul ! — / will not. — 
 Let me perish — if so it seemeth meet to Heaven — but 
 George's fame is dear to me, as my own salvation. God 
 knows well, and I can conceive how circumstances,. . . . 
 the lapse of a minute, which churchmen vainly pretend 
 distains, with irreversible dyes, the white radiance of our 
 immortality — I do not believe it ; — 'tis a libel on the 
 goodness of that Power, who spake the soul into being. 
 Oh, he was heavenly in his aspirations ! And who knows 
 but the false lustre of a diadem ? — no, no, it was not 
 that ; — enough, the Great Spirit, to whom all hearts be 
 open, sees what was his plea — by what casuistry he fell, 
 though I do not. He takes in, as I do, the whole bright 
 tenor of Martinuzzi's life; and if he visit, in his justice, 
 this single, isolated blot, it will be by a proof of the infi- 
 nity of his mercy. And shall I deal with the man of my 
 heart, more hardly than doth his Maker ? The spirit of 
 faith, and a love of fame, went hand in hand with Mar- 
 tinuzzi. The fulness of the one, he will partake in 
 heaven. Oh ! why should Alicia rob him, of his inherit- 
 ance upon earth ? No, come what may, hereafter, I

 Write no farther; and this memorial shall perish with 
 me." * * * 
 
 [Here there was a break in the ma?iuscript.] 
 " I again take up my pen. The monk, I expected, 
 hath been with me. Under the seal of confession, I have 
 lodged in him, as tremendous a secret, as penitent ever 
 confided to holy church : — he hath prevailed upon me, 
 to write on ; and hath pledged to me His salvation, that, 
 as long as Martinuzzi sees the light; the secret of this 
 manuscript shall never be divulged ; nor after, to the 
 detriment of the Lady Czerina, and unless the very ex- 
 istence of my native country depend upon its publica- 
 tion. Such a contingency can, hardly, lurk in the womb 
 of time. I will write on. The ministering offices of the 
 holy man have subdued, while they soothed, my violent 
 nature ; — there he sits, waiting for me to complete my al- 
 lotted task, and consummate, at once, the token of my 
 repentance, nd the evidence of my crimes. His face is 
 draperied in his cowl ; his hands are clasped, as in 
 prayer. Was that his sigh ? Twas like the moan of a 
 breaking heart. His voice had a strange fascination 
 over me ; — that man must be good. I never, before, felt 
 my nature so awed, and softened, by any human being, 
 save by him. Tis well, at this fearful hour — was that 
 a sigh, or a sob ? So, — that being shall have his way. 
 Reason and love, both advise me to be silent : but fate will 
 wrench the secret from my heart, — albeit in agony. Yes; 
 I must write on. 
 
 " It was about the time, that Isabella promised an 
 heir to King John, that the princess discovered herself 
 to be enceinte. This event naturally proved the source 
 of intolerable anxiety to Beatrice, whose mind, as I 
 before observed, never recovered its original tone. That 
 obligation to secrecy, she was under, and the difficulty, 
 which her present condition made such concealment be 
 attended with, terrified and overwhelmed her. How was 
 she to hide her situation from all observers ? What

 would be the lot of the innocent being, she was about 
 to introduce, under such unpromising auspices, to the 
 hard and harsh theatre of existence ? Many were our 
 consultations upon the subject, and bitter the tears she 
 shed, upon my sympathizing bosom. At length, how- 
 ever, it was agreed, that, for some weeks, antecedent to 
 her accouchement, she should confine herself wholly to 
 her chamber, under pretence of indisposition. A strange 
 female gipsy, named Unna, was introduced, by Mar- 
 tinuzzi, and was domiciled in the palace, in the capa- 
 city of her nurse. There was a mystery, in the relations 
 of Martinuzzi with this woman, that I never rightly could 
 understand. She was an unaccountable being, at once 
 mystical and familiar. She seemed to possess a meta- 
 physic acumen, similar to that I was endowed with, and 
 could fathom the thoughts of all, who came within the 
 sphere of her observation, but was unapproachable 
 herself. I had not been long subject to her skill, ere 
 she plucked out the heart of my mystery, and, by her 
 looks and expressions, gave me reason to believe, that 
 she read my passion for Martinuzzi. 
 
 " And now the eventful hour, that was to give a prince 
 to Hungary, was rapidly drawing nigh. The princess 
 had, early, recommended to Isabella, the services of 
 Unna ; and at the period of King John's departure from 
 Buda, it was arranged, that the gipsy attendant of his sis- 
 ter, should be the queen's midwife. It so chanced, not 
 many hours before the queen's being seized with the pains 
 of labour, that the Princess Beatrice gave birth to a girl. 
 I and Unna were alone privy to the secret of the babe's 
 existence ; — she was confided to my care. The new- 
 born infant was asleep, and I was hanging over her, 
 seeking to trace in her minute and unformed lineaments, 
 a resemblance to her too-beloved sire, when Unna ab- 
 ruptly rushed into the room, where I was seated. Her 
 features were inflamed, — her eyes, at all times wild and

 MANUSCRIPT XXX. 223 
 
 dilated, now glared with an expression, too mighty for 
 concealment. She peered into my face an instant, with- 
 out speaking. I was struck, I believe, with visible terror, 
 and with difficulty inquired after her grace. 
 
 " * The queen is delivered,' replied Unna, in a voice 
 of hollow potency. 
 
 " * And her child V I would have said, but the sounds 
 faltered on my lips, for the gipsy produced the infant, 
 looked at it for a second, then turned her gaze on the 
 unconscious innocent, I hushed on my lap, and finally 
 fixed her eyes on mine, with a significance that, were I 
 to live for ages, would never be obliterated from my 
 memory. It did not require my long acquaintance with 
 the symbolical language of the human countenance, my 
 deep insight into the hidden thoughts of others, to read 
 the terrible meaning of that glance ; — her purpose was 
 there written, in characters of fire ; respecting her mo- 
 tive I pretend not, even yet, to form the remotest con- 
 ception. I turned away my encountering gaze, like one 
 scorched to the soul. 
 
 " ' Alicia Swartz,' said the gipsy, after a minute's 
 mutual and portentous silence, ' you would not, I am 
 persuaded, suffer the offspring of George Martinuzzi, to 
 pine throughout the pilgrimage of an obscure and un- 
 honoured life, when it rests with you, that she should 
 rank the foremost in the land.' 
 
 " ' What do you mean?' I said, though I apprehended 
 her too well. 
 
 "'This male infant is the queen's,' returned Unna, 
 who is yet unconscious of his birth ; every attendant is, 
 for the instant, occupied about her grace's person. 
 Then take the boy, and give me the child of Martinuzzi, 
 to make a queen of.' 
 
 " She presented me the infant to exchange, T drew 
 back with a mute gesture of dissent. 
 
 " ' You will not !' presently exclaimed Unna. ' I warn

 you, I act by the princess's authority. How will you 
 answer to her, when she shall demand the motive of your 
 refusal ?' 
 
 " I believed that the gipsy spoke truth. What she 
 said, explained the nature of her long and frequent pri- 
 vate conferences with the king's sister, and accounted for 
 certain mysterious hints, let drop by Beatrice, which, at 
 the time, had exceedingly troubled me, and baffled my 
 curiosity. ' And how,' I rejoined, after a short pause, 
 1 were I, as you would have me, to become an accomplice 
 in this dishonourable deed, could I ever dare confront 
 Martinuzzi ? — What reply could I make him, when he 
 shall ask me for his child V 
 
 " ' By obeying the princess herein, you will simply be 
 acting in accordance to his wishes,' replied Unna. 
 
 " It is false ! I exclaimed, indignantly, Martinuzzi 
 knows nought of this treachery. Away, woman ! — you 
 tempt me in vain, — I stand betwixt my country and trea- 
 son — between George and infamy." 
 
 " * George,' said Unna, with a sarcastic emphasis, on 
 the Christian appellation, ' knows better than you can, 
 what is for the advantage of his country ; and his honour 
 may safely rest in his own keeping ; but there is no time 
 to waste on silly scruples. Peruse this order, girl, and 
 judge for yourself, what are the wishes of the Bishop of 
 Waradin in this regard.' 
 
 " She held out to me a paper. I snatched at it, and 
 read the following words: ' Dear Alicia, state-affairs will 
 require my presence at Pesth during this and the following 
 day. You will not prevent Unna doing with the infant, 
 according as she will explain to you ; however the cir- 
 cumstance may surprise, it has been long in the contem- 
 plation both of Beatrice and myself, and you will perceive, 
 on reflection, how such a course must operate to the 
 child's ultimate good. George.' 
 
 " I read this note. I dashed my hand across my eyes, 
 to wipe away my blinding tears. I re-read it, and exa-

 mined the characters closely. I could not be mistaken — 
 it was George's writing. I tore the paper to bits. * Do 
 the bishop's bidding !' I suddenly exclaimed, with bitter- 
 ness, at the same time making the fatal interchange of 
 the children. Hardly had I received within my arms 
 the son of John of Zapola, ere Unna quitted the cham- 
 ber. Oh, the anguish of those tears, wrung from the 
 heart, by the reluctant conviction of the unworthiness of 
 one we love! Not if an angel had descended from heaven 
 to declare it, would I, a minute before, have credited such 
 dishonour of Martinuzzi, and now, I had his own hand- 
 writing to attest the reality of his guilt. But his least 
 wish was to me law — it was past — it was too late to be 
 repented — to be remedied. I had consummated for him 
 the crime, he had dared to conceive. I, who, next to my 
 love for George, hugged to my heart the warmest, 
 strongest feelings of loyalty and patriotism, became, by 
 a single act, a traitor to my country and my king. It 
 was not, until I recovered from the first paroxysm of my 
 grief at Martinuzzi's crime, and at that, into which I had 
 been myself surprised, that I recollected that my bro- 
 ther Luke would know, that the royal boy I then held, 
 could not be the same babe that he beheld, only the hour 
 before, sleeping on my lap. The distinction of sex must 
 inevitably disclose our conspiracy ; the thought was tor- 
 ture, and I needed it not, Heaven knows, to add to my 
 wretchedness ; but what was to be done ? I sent, in all 
 haste, for Unna to come to me; it was some time before 
 she could be spared from the sick chamber. In the inte- 
 rim, my brother had stolen, unannounced, into my room. 
 I raised ray eyes, and beheld him gazing, with astonished 
 and aghast visage, on me and the little changeling by 
 my side. By what intuition I know not, but a single 
 glance appeared to give him a knowledge of the trans- 
 position, that had been effected. He charged me with the 
 deed. I was ever a bad hypocrite ; my agitated voice 
 and embarrassed manner effectually betrayed me. Luke

 had just succeeded, in extracting from me the truth, 
 when Unna entered. I told her, by what accident my 
 brother had become cognizant of her meditated treason. 
 She started, fixed her dark and penetrating eyes on 
 Luke; adjured him, by every motive of self-interest, to 
 conceal his knowledge of the matter, and accede to our 
 conspiracy. I joined my entreaties to the gipsy's, remind- 
 ing him, what monstrous ingratitude it would evince, to be 
 the cause of destruction to the man, to whom we both owed 
 our lives. 
 
 " ' And think/ subjoined Unna, ' what prospects the 
 patronage of the princess, and the rewards of Martinuzzi, 
 must open to your ambition.' 
 
 '* ' Ay,' repeated my brother, in a strange and hollow 
 voice, ' the patronage of the princess !' 
 
 " The sardonic smile, which accompanied these words 
 alarmed me ; it confirmed me in my opinion of a cer- 
 tain matter, I had often before suspected, relative to my 
 brother, to which I need not, and, therefore, will not 
 make further allusion in this place. Unna noted it also, 
 and, by being possessed of his secret, became master of 
 his destiny. To my great relief, and somewhat to my 
 surprise, Luke eventually yielded to our arguments, or 
 our solicitations. Two days afterwards, the Bishop of 
 Waradin returned to Ofen. 
 
 " As a mother might mourn over the tomb of her only- 
 begotten child, had I bewailed the dereliction of Marti- 
 nuzzi. I could not bear to see him, at that time ; my 
 grief was too fresh. I dreaded his company ; in the

 proach. Meanwhile, T knew that he and Unna, and my 
 brother, had frequent conferences. He would hold long 
 discourses with Beatrice, and when he left her, she would 
 weep and lament for hours. 
 
 " One day, Luke came to me, bearing an order from 
 Martinuzzi, who was at Pesth, that I should deliver the 
 king's son, into his hands. From the manner of my

 brother, in acquitting himself of this message, a vagne and 
 undefined suspicion of something wrong arose in my mind. 
 I regarded him with a steadfast eye. — ' What/ I de- 
 manded, ' are you about to do with the babe V 
 
 *' He made answer ' That he was commissioned by the 
 bishop, to convey the child to the care and keeping of a 
 valued friend of his, residing in Transylvania.' 
 
 " Still I misdoubted some deception ; I scarcely knew 
 wherefore ; but I did doubt. ' Are you telling me the 
 truth, Luke V I solemnly asked. He vehemently pro- 
 tested that what he had affirmed, was the fact. I had 
 no pretence or authority to question him further. With 
 a misgiving heart, I consigned over to him the son of 
 John of Zapola and Isabella, . .as goodly an infant as 
 needed to be seen. He was marked on his left shoulder 
 with the stain and impression of a mulberry. I never 
 saw him more. An hour or two afterwards, Unna inter- 
 rupted my solitary meditations. 
 
 " ' I shall leave Buda to-morrow,' said she. 
 
 " ' So soon?' I replied, in some surprise. 
 
 " ' Ay !' she exclaimed, in a tone of triumph, ' the 
 object of my coming is accomplished.' 
 
 " I believe Unna gathered my wonder from my eyes ; 
 for she added, after a moment's hesitation, ' The child of 
 Martinuzzi shall sit upon the throne of St. Stephen, — and 
 the first king of Hungary, who, since Ladislas, hath dared 
 refuse, to ratify the passport of the Bishop of Funfkir- 
 chen, to Thomas Polgar and his descendants, shall rue, 
 in the blood of his child, the vengeance of a Cygani.' 
 
 " ' The blood of his child !' I repeated, gathering my 
 stifled breath, in an agony of undissembled horror. 
 
 " ' Even so, girl,' returned Unna. ' Think you that Mar- 
 tinuzzi turns traitor by halves ? Learn that Luke Swartz, 
 by his order, will put that boy to death, ere yonder pale 
 crescent shall have this night reached her meridian.' 
 
 " The words 1 would have framed, came from my lips 
 in an imperfect murmur, and I tottered to a chair, and

 fixed my glazed looks upon the gipsy, who met my glance 
 with a smile, that curdled my blood. 
 
 " ' But not to the Bishop of Waradin, or your brother,' 
 continued Unna, ' whisper your knowledge of this trea- 
 son. Enough ; it suits my ends, that you are cognizant 
 of it ; be dumb to them, mute for ever more — to all 
 others I know you will — there rests a spell upon your 
 lips, you cannot burst through — fine and impassible as 
 air, but strong as seal of adamant : that spell, I need 
 not say, is love. Such fantasies, as such a passion can 
 afford a virgin, till she dies, are yours, so I leave you to 
 your sick dreams, child, and to remembrance.' 
 
 " Saying these words, Unna quitted the room. Let me 
 not double the pangs of death, by renewing, even in 
 thought, the drooping despondency, the sinking of the 
 spirit, which, for months after the foregoing disclosure, 
 weighed me down to the grave — I never recovered the 
 shock. Fierce, indeed, was the havock, which the idea 
 of George's unworthiness made with my constitution ; it 
 helped to wing that pityless shaft, which my convic- 
 tion of his merits, had first elanced. At this distance 
 of time, the recollection of that hour's agony, is as fresh, 
 as the woe of yesterday. Ever since, from the hectic 
 languor and other symptoms, mostly incident to my 
 matin hour, have I felt the powers of life rapidly decay- 
 ing away. Why should I over again detail the nature of 
 my love for Martinuzzi ? I have said, that it made me a 
 deliberate and sedentary suicide; but it was his falling 
 off, from how bright a sphere ! that helped to barb the 
 dart, or, rather, dipped it in a poison, more fatal than 
 that of the Lernsean hydra. It was his dereliction, that 
 gave the last and poignant sting to the wound, that is 
 destined to lay me low. I have little more to add. I 
 was with the Princess Beatrice, when she was struck by a 
 chance shot, in a pretended attack on our retinue, in the 
 forest of Belivar. I, subsequently, nursed and attended 
 her highness, during the lingering illness, and incurable

 loss of reason, consequent on that event. It is not long 
 since, Martinuzzi had her conveyed from my care, to the 
 citadel of Hermanstadt. And I, Gracious God ! I was 
 abandoned, . . left an outcast among a strange and uncouth 
 race, to perish. All but that, I could have borne — and 
 even that, is not without its solace. That I should be 
 separated from Martinuzzi, ere I died, is, indeed, an un- 
 looked-for evil ; but it is the last — it forms a fit period 
 to my dreamy and unsubstantial life, that the playmate 
 of -my infancy, and the instructor of my childhood, and 
 the dear unconscious murderer of my maturer peace, 
 should leave me, unfriended and alone, to glut the ra- 
 venous maw of insensate death, with the no infrequent, 
 however unheeded, offering of a broken heart. 
 
 Alicia."* 
 
 Slowly, and lost in thought, rose the royal lady — the 
 momentous manuscript dropped from her hands uncon- 
 sciously. Every syllable of the celibataire s confession 
 had been gone through, without her having moved a 
 limb, or stirred from the settee, where she had hurriedly 
 cast herself, on first entering the room. 
 
 We feel, that any language, within our humble reach, 
 must sink under the endeavour, to convey to the reader 
 Isabella's state of mind, and the agitation of her various 
 feelings. Her mental vision, like the corporeal vision of 
 a drunkard, staggered to and fro, under the confused 
 and intoxicating sense of what she had just learned. 
 The triumphant malice, with which she recurred, in 
 thought, to the heaped-up measure of her " wrongs un- 
 redressed, and insults unavenged," f and contemplated, 
 in near perspective, that dire retribution which, her mind 
 had long been predictive, would one day be hers, defies 
 the feeble skill of the writer of this tale to depict, with

 any thing like the accuracy, he would wish, or the force 
 of colouring, he deems requisite. It is, indeed, in such 
 passages as we have now in hand, in the probing and 
 anatomising the elements of the soul, which such crea- 
 tions as that, we have attempted in Isabella, impose upon 
 the author, that he finds it hard to realise and embody 
 his own conceptions, and is compelled (as in every other 
 part of his performance) to leave much to the indulgence, 
 and refer much of the illustration, which might be pro- 
 duced, to the imagination of whoso shall honour him, by 
 glancing over his pages, . . "si qua latent, meliora putat." 
 The utmost he can pretend to achieve, is sometimes to 
 suggest ideas to an imaginative and liberal-minded 
 reader, rather than to express them : — 
 
 " His apprehensive judgment will conceive, 
 Out of the shadow we can only show, 
 How fair the body was." * 
 
 The queen's hatred of Martinuzzi hardly admitted of 
 augmentation, but it was with something like joy, that 
 she learned, that those indignities, which his politic am- 
 bition had ventured to inflict upon her, in the face of the 
 world, were as a feather in the balance, compared to 
 that long-hidden and villanous injury, which the confes- 
 sion of Alicia brought to light. The ample justification, 
 which she thought, she there discerned for the deed she 
 meditated, was as rivets to her steeled design, and made 
 her look upon the assassination of the regent, as an ac- 
 ceptable sacrifice to Heaven. The assurance of Marti- 
 nuzzi's treason, by showing how ill-founded was the secret 
 suspicion, that would at times intrude, that her enemy 
 scarcely deserved such intensity of hatred, lightened her 
 very heart ; but there was one point, incidental to the 
 matter of Isabella's meditation, in which, more than 
 aught else, she exulted. It was not merely from her 
 gratification, in being free to hate her rival — it was not,

 great as she found the relief, the liberation of her pent- 
 up antipathy to Czerina, — feelings "subdued and che- 
 rished long," and now set afloat in full tide, by the 
 discovery of the close relations, subsisting between Mar- 
 tinuzzi and our heroine; — no — her exultancy arose 
 from the unhoped-for, and exquisite refinement of that 
 revenge, she had so long suspired, and which such a dis- 
 covery enabled her to take, upon her perjured lover. 
 To commission the hand of Antoine Ferraro to murder, 
 in the usurper of her son's dignities, the father of that 
 hated girl, for whose sake he had proved false to her! — 
 it was a retribution so complete, so accurately apportioned 
 to the nature of his crime, that even Isabella, wounded 
 as she had been in every point, where her soul most lived 
 along the nerve, found the joyous anticipation outweigh 
 all, she had been made to endure. She felt, that she 
 breathed again, and that the Egyptian darkness, which 
 had long covered her with its pall, had sunk away into 
 " a cloud, no bigger than a man's hand." How did she 
 then congratulate herself, on that anxious and prophetic 
 feeling, which had prompted her to re-assume the habili- 
 ments of Ferraro on the second night, as, on the previous 
 one, she had apparelled herself in them, from his absolute 
 inability, in his inebriate condition, to wait upon Piadena. 
 By no other chance, could she have forestalled that in- 
 formation, which, if indeed, as was otherwise inevitable, 
 it had reached the ears of Ferraro, must have for ever 
 frustrated her bloody ends. But she knew, that affairs 
 could not long continue in the state they were, and 
 apprehended, that it behoved her, to assure the success of 
 her practices, by precipitating them. Pereny had sig- 
 nified his intention of waiting personally upon her on 
 the following day, to communicate those important cir- 
 cumstances which, happily, her good genius had already 
 possessed her of. After their interview, he would indu- 
 bitably seek his son, whose discovery of the parentage 
 of Czerina could not be much longer prevented. It only

 remained, therefore, so to take her measures, that the 
 blow be struck in the interim. This seemed no feasible 
 matter. Isabella took several turns in the chamber ; 
 she stopped, and thus soliloquized aloud. 
 
 "What was 't, I overheard the traitor whisper his 
 daughter? To-morrow, at noon — in her chamber ! So, 
 so — I've long since sentenced this ambitious priest to 
 execution ; and now ! — ay, so be it ! That be the time 
 and place, to seal my righteous anger on his heart !"

 That same night, or rather morning, for midnight had 
 long passed, Isabella sought the ante-chamber, which 
 had been destined to Ferraro's imperturbable repose. 
 Sound, indeed, and deep and lasting, beyond natural 
 rest, proved the captive's sleep, in consequence of the 
 strength of the potion, which he had so inconsiderately 
 quaffed. The sun rose, and was past his meridian, ere 
 his lethargy began to wear off. The queen took care to 
 be at hand, and, after some brief and troubled discourse, 
 she had the satisfaction to see him sink once more, under 
 the influence of the medicated draught. The sound of 
 the key, turning in the lock of his room-door, roused him 
 anew from this lethargic and unnatural slumber. Isa- 
 bella's object, in his detention, being fully attained, she 
 approached his couch with some slight refreshment; and, 
 without acknowledging the stratagem of her having drug- 
 ged his wine, or explaining any part of her subsequent 
 machinations, she proceeded to whet his irresolute pur- 
 pose, against the life of Martinuzzi, by every subtle 
 incentive, which the malevolence of her wit could sug- 
 gest. In the end, she engaged Ferraro to discuss with 
 her the necessary preliminaries, in the course of the fol-

 lowing forenoon, and on her departure, tacitly restored 
 her captive to his liberty, by omitting to shut the room 
 door, after having previously deposited his garments by the 
 bed-side, not greatly the worse for wear ; without which 
 act of restitution, indeed, he could scarcely, in decency, 
 have availed himself of the opportunity of retreat. 
 
 Then Isabella retired to her own couch, but not to 
 repose. Her brain was too loaded with wild and swell- 
 ing thoughts — too rapt with the incredible intelligence 
 she had lately obtained, and the hoarded vengeance she 
 hoped to gratify on the forthcoming morrow. With the 
 first ray, that brightened the grey clouds of the east, she 
 was startled, from her state of feverish restlessness, by war- 
 cries, and trumpets sounding to arms, and the thunder of 
 artillery, pealing at no great distance. The whole city 
 was aroused from the same cause. It was whispered, 
 amid a confused medley of surmises, that certain Walla- 
 chian freehands had made a sudden hourra on the capital 
 during the night, and now scoured over the neighbouring 
 plains — their encampment was already established with- 
 out the walls. They were said to be commanded by the 
 Vilez Iwan, who, on the overnight, had despatched two 
 successive flags of truce to the regent, which were re- 
 fused admittance within the gates. The public ear was 
 stunned by all sorts of exaggerated and tortured reports, 
 which pointed to an approaching storm, and stifled ru- 
 mours began to circulate through the city, that Marti- 
 nuzzi was to be compelled, by Turkey, to lay down his 
 authority, and the great Richter to be substituted to the 
 sovereignty of Transylvania, under the protection of the 
 Ottoman emperor, who was encamped within a few miles 
 of Hermanstadt, at the head of immense forces. 
 
 While the public mind was in this feverish state, pieces 
 of intelligence got wind, between the hours of ten and 
 eleven in the morning, which revived, amongst the inha- 
 bitants, all their original unlimited faith in the paramount 
 genius of Martinuzzi. It was rumoured, that, in the

 MANUSCRIPT XXXI. 235 
 
 dead of the preceding night, the regent had issued from 
 the city, at the head of certain of his choicest troops, 
 and making a flank movement upon the Wallachian camp, 
 the Richter had been taken by surprise ; and, after a san- 
 guinary, but vain resistance, had suffered a signal defeat. 
 
 The daring spirit of the prelate, in thus sallying forth, 
 struck every one with admiration. Recalling his former 
 exploits, they readily credited this last achievement, the 
 truth of which was presently confirmed by a long roll of 
 musketry, announcing the warlike cardinal's triumphal 
 entrance, with only a small escort, through the barrier of 
 Hermanstadt. His army had camped some miles from 
 the city, but he was followed by his wounded veterans, 
 and accompanied by the trophies of his victory, which 
 consisted of the enemy's baggage, ammunition, and seve- 
 ral standards, intermixed with vast numbers of prisoners, 
 including the Richter Iwan himself, and many of his 
 principal captains. 
 
 Meanwhile, we return to Isabella, who started from 
 her unquiet bed, and, pale with anxious passions, hur- 
 riedly arrayed herself at early dawn, and went forth from 
 her chamber, to be greeted with some of the wild rumours, 
 we have glanced at above. Musing, she traced back her 
 irregular steps, when, all of a sudden, the thought crossed 
 her, that Ferraro was not likely to sleep through the din 
 and uproar, which had roused the rest of the palace, and 
 that thus her projects might yet be thwarted, byachance- 
 meeting between him and Pereny, occurring before the 
 irremediable deed was done. Indeed, had any such 
 cross accident intervened, it must have materially altered 
 the catastrophe of our narrative. Isabella quickened her 
 movement, and hastily passed into the apartment, which 
 had been converted into the prison of Ferraro. The 
 room was vacant ! She felt troubled, and at a loss how 
 to act. Ferraro had fled. She was tolerably confident, 
 he would not fail the appointment he had made with her; 
 but, in the interval, what was not in the range of possi-

 bilities ? He might learn to know his sire — or perhaps, 
 even now, under favour of the general confusion, he had 
 sought the society of Czerina. The thought was worm- 
 wood. How did she regret her inadvertence, in leaving 
 the door unbarred, as at a pace, whose trembling de- 
 feated its own haste, she sped towards the chamber of 
 her, whom, since her birth, she had instinctively detested, 
 though, until the last few hours, she believed her to be 
 her own daughter! Without a preparatory word, to sig- 
 nify her presence, she burst into the room. The droop- 
 ing young lady, who was pensively reclining at the further 
 end of the chamber, started up, on the door opening. 
 She was already dressed, at least, if the light and virgin 
 wrapper, she had loosely thrown about her, might be 
 termed being so. The seraphic outline of her features be- 
 trayed an expression of mingled surprise, agitation, and 
 alarm. For a second, she appeared undecided, then quickly 
 crossed the apartment, to salute her unwonted visitor. 
 
 " Oh, bless you, dear madam, for this !" she exclaim- 
 ed ; " those sounds awakened me, and I 've been greatly 
 terrified. My nerves, I fear, are not as they were. Oh, 
 bless you ! bless you !" 
 
 The queen shrunk back, from the proffered embrace 
 of Czerina, and looked at her, with a slow and scru- 
 tinizing glance. A strange feeling crept over her; — it 
 was the first time she had seen his,. .Martinuzzis daugh- 
 ter ! A cold dew from the heart gathered on her brow, 
 and, moving away, her eyes made a curious survey of 
 the apartment. " What would you, wild thing ?" dropped 
 chill and slowly from her lips. 
 
 " Dear mother !" said Czerina, following Isabella, and 
 looking earnestly in her face, " how pale you are!" 
 
 " Mother !" echoed the other, with a frightful smile ; 
 " how strange ! — Pale, does she say ?" continued the 
 queen, more wildly ; " ay, I am gone pale with hate, 
 sure, hereafter, I shall blush. — Avaunt ! I loathe thy 
 sight !"

 MANUSCRIPT XXXI. 237 
 
 The deep blue of Czerina's eyes was begemmed with 
 sudden tears, as, throwing- her arms about Isabella's 
 neck, she returned, in mild and piteous accents, " You 
 are not well ; alas ! you would not say so else." 
 
 " Take off thy fangs !" screamed Isabella. — "I would 
 as lief an adder crawled about me ! — I would as lief, 
 by heavens ! a viper kissed me ! Thou art my abhor- 
 rence ! — pah!'' and, saying these words, she roughly 
 extricated herself from the encircling arm of Czerina. 
 Long, and fixedly, she then gazed, or rather scowled, on 
 her, as if she would, that the fabled power of the basilisk 
 were in her breath, and in her glance. 
 
 " Oh, what has chanced ? what have I ignorantly done 
 to offend ?" inquired the poor petrified girl ; — " kill me, 
 mother," she proceeded, " but repulse me not so coldly, 
 nor look thus at me ; — kill me, rather !" 
 
 " Not yet" returned the queen, significantly. There 
 was a pause. ft Who departed hence, ere I came hi- 
 ther?" she abruptly demanded, in a fierce and peremp- 
 tory tone. 
 
 " Indeed, no soul," replied Czerina. 
 
 " You lie, minion !" exclaimed Isabella. " Why dost 
 tremble then ? 'Tis guilt — 'tis consciousness — 'tis — 
 pah ! I conster thee ; so ; he went not forth, you say ?" 
 
 " He !" repeated Czerina; " in mercy, whom !" 
 
 " Ha! does it start you ? — no matter; well, poor 
 wretch ! you shall be his bride — some time to-morrow." 
 
 " His? whose? — Oh, unkind!" 
 
 " His ! whose ! — I see thou triflest with me ; — 'twere 
 safer to play with lightning. Take heed, white fool ! if 
 I detect thee in an inward laugh, by my eternal wrongs ! 
 I'll stab thee straight, and throw away my hopes upon 
 the paltry vengeance, so I may be sure thou'rt dead. — 
 What devil hast thou ?" 
 
 " Oh, why are you so angry ?" sobbed Czerina, the 
 tear ebbing insensibly from her eyes. Her figure had

 so fallen away of late, that she looked, rather like the 
 waxen model of a corpse, than flesh and blood. 
 
 " I ask, what doth make thee shudder, emaciated 
 thing ?" inquired Isabella, after a pause, her eye sternly 
 resting, at the same time, on the angelic countenance 
 and aerial shape of the appalled maiden. 
 
 " If I tremble, 'tis at thee, — you look so dreadfully," 
 replied Czerina. 
 
 Isabella turned away. Half unconsciously, half ea- 
 gerly, she threw open a leaf of a closet, near which 
 she stood, closed it again, and said, with bitterness, " I 
 should be blind, and never see such things ; send for him 
 back, — I'll not intrude." 
 
 " My brains are dulled, and I know not what you 
 think," interposed Czerina, in a gentle voice. 
 
 " Do you not so, my very youthful interloping ma- 
 dam ? — I'll lighten thee then, meek thing ! thou art a 
 wanton. Ha, start ! — but tell me now — in secret, — be 
 sure I '11 blab not, — has not a certain handsome secre- 
 tary, a likely man enough, I own too ; nay, be not strange 
 with me, I've said I'm close; and if (such things will 
 chance) a whisper gets abroad of amorous doings, I'll 
 hush thy pleasures up, as men do murders." 
 
 Czerina shivered, and grew even more corpse-like than 
 before, as though the blood had, indeed, all descended 
 from her cheek to the labouring heart. She made no 
 reply. 
 
 " Well, puny wench," proceeded the queen, after a 
 pause, " you have not told me yet, what thought drinks 
 up the ruby of thy cheek. Art not a spotted harlot 
 now? Come, confess, — confess; — that oil-tongued, 
 cozening, light-o'-love, that — (ruin seize ye !) — thy — 
 pah ! that man ! Ferraro ! — where have you hid him ?" 
 
 Czerina's lip could only echo the last syllables. " Hid 
 him !" she murmured, vainly endeavouring to hide her 
 blushes and her tears, by covering her face with hands, 
 too little to serve the purpose of concealment.

 " Ay, have ye," and Isabella's voice suddenly fal- 
 tered, — " Have ye not passed delicious times together, 
 while I lay sleeping — no, tossing through whole, endless 
 sightless, hours, awake on my lone couch? — yet what's 
 to me ? I '11 know, though ; — but that was heretofore — 
 I speak not of it. Hath he not lain at thy feet, within 
 this hour V and she sent forth a glance, from her dark 
 eyes, as if to penetrate the depths of the damsel's heart, — 
 " and gazed, and kissed thy lip ? and took his oath upon 
 thy pantofles ? — 'twas wondrous sweet ; ay, puling ana- 
 tomy that thou art ! he knows the way, — he can pro- 
 test, I trow, as high as heaven, — as deep as hell, at will. 
 Hath he not been here, that — that — I want a name 
 by which to brand him ; — you know the man I mean." 
 " Oh no, — upon my soul, no !" 
 
 " Stop — strangle that wicked lie upon thy lip, for fear 
 it choke thee, or I kill you. He left the chamber just 
 before I sought you ; — he did," she added, and the veins 
 rose upon her temples as she raised her voice to its 
 shrillest, loudest tones, " you know he did." 
 
 " I dare swear he did not," meekly replied Czerina; 
 " I have told many hours, and this, the last, here, all 
 alone." 
 
 " Ha ! ha ! why didst thou tremble, then, upon my 
 entrance ? — Whom didst thou look to see ?" 
 
 " The lord cardinal," said Czerina, with bloodless lip. 
 " How so ? 'tis not noon yet ; — though, would it were ; 
 for then — so, the lord cardinal — what's he?" 
 
 " Methought the sound was Martinuzzi's, and I shook

 " Thou art my fiend !" interrupted Isabella, with a 
 vehement gesture of disgust. " Pah ! I am grown deadly 
 sick, — throw wide your casement, girl, — give me some 
 air, — I have a fever on me, and would sit awhile, in the 
 chill dew of day-break." 
 
 Czerina opened the casement, as she was directed.

 Isabella threw herself on a fauteuil beside it, and leant 
 forth in the dark grey atmosphere of morn. The unhappy 
 girl stood, or rather crouched, near, her heart swelling 
 with a variety of conflicting emotions. The roar of firing 
 in the distance was quick and heavy, and became dis- 
 tinctly audible. 
 
 " Hear ye that peal?" cried the queen, with dilated 
 eyes and expanded hands. " Again, another, and ano- 
 ther ! They are no chance bursts, those, girl ! but the 
 signal of Heaven's aid to the cause of justice and right, 
 in their last extremity." 
 
 Czerina was silent. 
 
 After a pause, the queen resumed the colloquy. 
 " These cold regards are pleasant," she said, — " you are 
 to be envied ! — Envied ! ha ! ha ! — Hast used this 
 chamber long, child ?" 
 
 " My memory cannot go back to that point of time, 
 I slept not in it." 
 
 " Oh, to be sure, 1 had forgot me; — 'twas here my 
 minion, having fed on mandrakes, dreamed herself 
 away." 
 
 The countenance of Czerina blanched to the hue of 
 death, as, casting upon the queen a wild glance of 
 terror, tottered, and caught at the back of a chair, to 
 prevent her dropping to the ground. 
 
 u It sounded wondrous marvellous at the time !" con- 
 tinued Isabella, — " all Erdely marvelled at thy wan- 
 dering o' nights ; and well they might, forsooth, thou 
 meagre, unlaid ghost ! — but the riddle's read at last." 
 
 ''My God! what mean you by this tyranny?" ex- 
 claimed Czerina. 
 
 " Ha! do you wince? — Now could I find it in my 
 heart to — no, my vengeance will not cool with waiting,

 tion is "

 convulse her throat. " For pity's sake, forbear me now !" 
 she sobbed, restraining her tears, though the attempt well 
 nigh choked her; — " I'm weak, and faint, and wobegone 
 — and dying." She paused, while the convulsive shud- 
 derings, that ran through her frame, evidenced the 
 strength of her emotions. " I pray you," with difficulty, 
 she subjoined, "leave me quite alone awhile, — I pray 
 you, do!" 
 
 Unheedful of the poor girl's request, or the faltering 
 accents, with which it was preferred, the queen pro- 
 ceeded, " Are you touched, minion? — Yes, the solution 
 of thy dream is treason, — damned ! — brewed in the vaults 
 of Hermanstadt, or, what's the same, in hell !" 
 
 Ever since that fatal dream of her childhood, we some- 
 where told, in the outset of our story, any allusion to it 
 had jarred on the sensitive nerves of the unhappy daugh- 
 ter of Martinuzzi. She herself felt her health under- 
 mined, and, from the night in question, ought probably 
 to be dated her extreme physical debility, and gradual 
 prostration of strength and spirits. Her mind seems to 
 have been originally woven of so fine a texture, as to be 
 peculiarly liable to take its colouring, from any casual 
 impression, like unto that, which now shaded, or rather 
 darkened, its delicate fabric. Indeed, the very silence 
 she maintained, in relation to the memorable incident, we 
 allude to, deepened its mysterious horrors, in the solitude 
 of our heroine's heart, till they permanently worked them- 
 selves, into the substance of her character. Of late, as, 
 each succeeding day, it became more evident to others, 
 that her frame (like the opening bud fading beneath the 
 canker-worm) was fast wasting into a premature grave, 
 by no chance had there been any allusion to that la- 
 mentable circumstance : when, therefore, after such an 
 inexplicable scene, as had just oppressed her spirits, the 
 queen adverted, with abrupt harshness, to her terrible 
 night-mare, she exceeded the further endurance of the 
 tender nature of her victim. Czerina's lips unclosed ;

 her eyes strained from their sockets ; the strings of her 
 heart, already wound up to too great a degree of tension, 
 gave one single recoil, and, clasping her extenuated 
 hands together, she sank lifeless at the feet of her cal- 
 lous tormentor. 
 
 Isabella instantly arose, and gazing, with a brief re- 
 gard of fiendish triumph, on the pale blighted form be- 
 neath her, muttered, " Low ! lower yet, please God !" 
 and, with these words, without another look or syllable, 
 she quitted the room. 
 
 The tumult of Isabella's mind, for some hours after the 
 foregoing interview with our heroine, must be left to the 
 imagination of the reader. At one moment, on learning 
 that Iwan was thundering at the gates, she half-deter- 
 mined to abandon her purpose of assassination, and 
 rather to make her appeal to the Diet, which would shortly 
 assemble at Coloswar, and thus, overwhelm the tyrant 
 in the accumulated light, which she thought she could 
 throw upon his treasons. She would have the evidence 
 and authority of the Graf Pereny, and probably of others, 
 and be supported, by the arms of the victorious Iwan, 
 her son — the son of John of Zapola — the rightful 
 king of Hungary ! But, again, by adopting this latter 
 course, she must forego the exquisite satisfaction of 
 making Ferraro the instrument of his own destruction. 
 
 Harassed by conflicting feelings, did Isabella traverse 
 her apartment, as she waited, with restless impatience, 
 the return of Ferraro. It was the same chamber, we at- 
 tempted to describe in a former chapter, and was held 
 sacred to her and solitude. An apartment adjoining was 
 less private, and thither did messenger after messenger, con- 
 vey to the queen's ears the contradictory reports, which 
 sprung up on all sides, in endless succession, on that 
 eventful morning. Much of the information of what 
 was transacting, which she received by this means, she 
 had reason to know, however exaggerated, had some 
 foundation in truth. She entertained sanguine hopes,

 that the Richter Iwan would shortly dispossess Marti- 
 nuzzi of his usurped authority ; and the march of the 
 Turkish army upon Hermanstadt, tended to throw light, 
 upon a passage in an epistle, she had received from Sul- 
 tan Solyman, a few days subsequent to the battle of Co- 
 loswar, wherein he stated, that certain articles of a treaty, 
 he had lately entered into with the Richter Iwan, would 
 incapacitate him from fulfilling the engagement, stipulated 
 between her highness and Abu Obeida, which, combined 
 with circumstances, not uninteresting to her highness, at 
 that time transacting, compelled him, with whatever re- 
 gret, to decline, for the present, the honour of a matri- 
 monial alliance with the Lady Czerina. This, and other 
 matters of import, passed, like intermingled waves, over 
 the troubled sea of Isabella's mind, and her suspense re- 
 specting the cause of Ferraro's prolonged absence, was now 
 rapidly becoming intolerable. Every moment, she looked 
 for the coming of the Graf Pereny, and she dreaded his 
 encountering his son, ere the important blow, which was 
 to rid Transylvania of the incubus, which sat upon her 
 peace, was struck. Besides, the hour was near, at which 
 Martinuzzi had appointed to visit his daughter ; he might 
 happen, not to stay in Czerina's chamber, more than a few 
 minutes ; so that, unless the sacrificial priest were speedy, 
 the victim, she had devoted to the infernal deities, 
 might yet escape his doom. She gnashed her teeth in 
 impotent malice, at the thought. 
 
 " Are the injuries, I have been compelled to endure at 
 the hands of that man, indeed, unavengable?" she mur- 
 mured. At that moment, she heard one of her confi- 
 dential attendants enter the outer chamber ; she stepped 
 into the room, and, with a look of inquiry, asked those 
 particulars, with which her messenger was charged. 
 
 " The regent is not to be met with in Hermanstadt — 
 men say, your highness, he has fled." 
 
 " What's that you croak about ?" exclaimed the queen, 
 impetuously. " Escaped me !"

 Just then, another of her attendants entered. 
 
 " Martinuzzi," he said, in answer to a question of 
 Isabella, " quitted the city in the night-time, but not 
 alone." 
 
 u Not alone !" burst out the queen, " how can that 
 be? — time is not older by many hours, since I saw her 
 with these eyes. There's some mistake. By which route 
 hath he ta'en his flight ? — To the garrison under arms ? — 
 Who is in pursuit ?" 
 
 The above broken sentences were delivered, with all the 
 rapidity of headlong passion. The man endeavoured, but 
 his royal mistress gave him no opportunity, to interpose. 
 
 " The regent took with him all the disposable force in 
 Hermanstadt," at length he rejoined, " with the object, 
 as is surmised, of assailing the quarters of the Richter 
 Iwan, and, from the heavy firing, which aroused the city, 
 it is probable that a battle has already been fought." 
 
 " The heavy firing !" repeated Isabella, in sudden 
 alarm. " God, sir ! the firing has long since ceased ? — 
 Why was this kept from me ? — which side is worsted ? — 
 where is Iwan ? — who claims the victory ?" 
 
 " The report runs, that the Richter Iwan is defeated," 
 returned the man, 
 
 " Then report lies, sir !" hotly replied Isabella. 
 "Have scouts been sent forth? — despatch a special 
 courier straight to the Vilez Iwan, with my gratulations 
 — escort him hither — say, I stretch my heart to meet 
 him — do you hear? — What stand you staring for, with 
 those glazed eyes ? — Expressionless slave ! do your 
 bidding." 
 
 " There is a strict watch maintained, by Martinuzzi's 
 orders, upon the walls, to secure against the egress of 
 any one from the city — all passages are intercepted." 
 
 "His orders! — the tyrant! — Pray God ! his reign 
 soon close ! What means that discordant clangor ?" 
 
 The inquiry was caused by a faint swell of triumphant

 harmony, that seemed to rise up to the heavens, inter- 
 rupted with irregular discharges of artillery, from the 
 high battlements of the city. The reader will perceive, 
 that the same considerations, which swelled most other 
 bosoms in Hermanstadt, with exulting confidence, were, 
 to Isabella, the source of anxiety and terror. The firing 
 lasted only a few minutes, and, as it ceased, another 
 messenger hurried into the room. 
 
 " The regent is now making his triumphal entrance, 
 through the barrier," he exclaimed; " he returns at- 
 tended by a cavalcade of knights. We have gained the 
 victory — the Moldavians have been cut to pieces — the 
 Richter 's prisoner." 
 
 " Forbear the room," said Isabella, and she motioned 
 the messengers from her presence. 
 
 " So, then," she cried, in a deep, low, hollow voice, 
 as soon as she was left alone ; " the Fates have conspired 
 with wrong, and bloody tyranny and usurpation, — and 
 'tis almost vain to struggle longer. Yet, 'tis likely, he'll 
 hold talk with her, as he promised, if only to boast his 
 laurels, o'er my son. Already the grim and ghastly 
 hour of noon peals in the zenith. Where lags Ferraro 
 now? Those acclamations madden me — fools! abject, 
 crouching dastards ! Know ye not, the tyrant bears your 
 rightful king in chains? The leprosy that waits on 
 slavery, stick to ye ever ! So, now, 'tis clear one must 
 perish, — whether Iwan, or Martinuzzi, stands on the dan- 
 gerous passage of this hour. Oh ! come, Ferraro ! Not 
 in that minute, which first beheld our joys, wert thou 
 one half so welcome to my longing soul, as now thou 
 wilt be. Speed to thy assignation, though Cupid hath 
 changed quivers with cold death. Come ! I burn, im- 
 patient for thy sight. Where art thou ? — Antoine Fer- 
 raro, where ?" 
 
 "Here!" shouted the voice of him she called upon; 
 and with maniac visage, dishevelled hair, and apparel 
 all disordered, Antoine Ferraro rushed, wildly, into her

 presence. He had been abroad since dawn, and had 
 witnessed the triumphal pageant of Martinuzzi, file 
 in through the city gates. He had joined, through 
 very sympathy, in the piercing acclamations which 
 rent the air, as the conquering prelate, preceded by 
 a slender vanguard of spearmen, moved along to 
 the melodious thunders of martial music. He was on 
 horseback, and in acknowledging the shouts of the 
 people, with graceful obeisance on every side, once, for 
 a brief instant, as he was making his way through the 
 press, the Austrian secretary felt the regent's look settle 
 upon his Spanish hat. Ferraro well knew, that he was 
 noticed, but no light of recognition was suffered to 
 beam in that deep blue eye. The warlike gownsman 
 rode on; the glittering tide of cavalry, which followed, 
 rolled tumultuously towards the gates of the citadel, 
 which received the living torrent ; the guns were si- 
 lenced ; the glorious cortege, with their blazoned ban- 
 ners and pennons, flaring against the sun, disappeared ; 
 the assembled crowds swept forwards ; the rejoicing 
 shouts, and all the clashing clangour of warlike min- 
 strelsy, died away; and the clouds of smoke and dust, 
 left not a rack on the horizon, and still Ferraro conti- 
 nued rooted to the spot. It was some time ere he turned 
 away, and, in moody abstraction, sought his apartments. 
 He had hardly entered, when he received a written 
 order from the Marquis of Piadena, forthwith to per- 
 petrate the act of justice, to which he was pledged, if he 
 would not have his lovely guerdon assigned over to a 
 more adventurous, if not more devoted lover. The 
 idea was distraction, but no less so was that of the pos- 
 sibility, of his stooping his noble nature so low, as to be- 
 come an assassin. Hot, reckless, and insensate, he issued 
 forth, and traversed the city, without any object, with a 
 hurried and impatient step. At length, about mid-day, by 
 an accidental glance of the eye, he found himself, at the 
 gate of the palace. Heedless of what he did, he entered.

 and rushed into the auti-chamber of the queen, in the 
 mode and temper, we have already described. 
 
 "What's this, Ferraro?" began Isabella, in a gentle 
 voice. " Hath aught chanced, since we conferred to- 
 gether ? Speak, — your looks are wild." 
 
 " They better suit my thoughts, which are literal hell," 
 replied Ferraro. " Your evil words, last night, — the 
 evil suggestions, you left behind with me, rack me to tor- 
 ture ; my bosom heaves against a dreadful curse, dead- 
 lier than nightshade." 
 
 "Nay, be a man," said Isabella; — she approached 
 closer to him, and took hold of his hand. 
 
 " Dost note," proceeded Ferraro, " in what convulsive 
 sobs I fetch my breath ? My heart is sick, I tell you. My 
 brain whirls round ; this hour seems sable midnight to my 
 eyes ; within my ears perpetual noises hiss, like to the 
 multitudinous clamour of the damned, over their orgies. 
 I have been subject to a spell. What witchcraft is't? — 
 tell me." 
 
 " Come, come, Antoine," said Isabella, in soothing 
 accents, " be more temperate." 
 
 u How can I," cried Ferraro, wildly, " when there 
 blaze these torches round my brain, lighting me onwards, 
 to the dizzy brink of some tremendous precipice ? — to 
 feel how I am hastening to destruction, and yet have no 
 strength to turn aside ! And must my moth-like soul 
 rush on the blinding sun-beams thou hast gathered, to 
 scorch it into cinders ? I am sure thou art more pitiful ; 
 devise some different task, — is there not one for me, 
 but this?" 
 
 He ceased, and stood erect, but tottering ; his hands 
 were clenched, his eyes blood-shot and wandering, his 
 countenance deadly pale, save one single and burning 
 spot of crimson, that tinged his cheek. Isabella looked 
 at him steadfastly, but remained silent. 
 
 "Nay, nay," added Ferraro, after a pause; " I see, 
 thou'lt not insist that I do this murder."

 " No, i'faith," replied Isabella; " because the term's 
 a lie ; the positive times are wiser in their ends, — they 
 ask for blood, — his blood, whose sceptre makes their 
 shame, — his, who aspires to have his life their history. 
 Call not that act, which is the angel of God's wrath, a 
 murder. Methinks those sounds, which woke all Her- 
 manstadt from their deep sleep, this morn, might prompt 
 a man like thee, whose bosom swells, or should, with the 
 blood of Pereny, what befits him, when his country lies 
 prostrate at the foot of usurpation. Methinks, my indig- 
 nation, were I thee, and not as dull as the very floor you 
 tread on, could ill brook this day's disgrace, and feel 
 myself unhonoured in the land of my sires; and her I 
 loved transferred over, by the crowned tyranny of one, 
 born in Croatia, into the arms of my rival. If I would 
 not sink into the centre of the globe, to hide my shame, 
 were I that dastard !" 
 
 Ferraro, on whose jarred and perturbed feelings, the 
 appeal of Isabella made small impression, stood mute 
 and immovable. 
 
 " Why dost bend thy gaze on the blind earth ? Hath 
 deafness smitten thee?" presently demanded Isabella, 
 
 with some heat; " or is it ," the discourse was here 
 
 interrupted, by the sound of some one entering into an 
 adjoining room. Breaking off in the midst, she passed 
 behind the tapestry, and carefully closing the door, de- 
 scended to the apartment, which communicated with her 
 boudoir, by means of a small detached staircase. She 
 was informed, that a noble cavalier, who gave himself out 
 for the graf, Peter Pereny, was at the palace gates, — he 
 had come, he said, to request a private interview with 
 her highness." 
 
 " And he shall have it," said the queen, "that is, 
 presently. Usher the noble graf into the reception room." 
 The man was on the point of withdrawing, when Isabella 
 added; "Stay, — a word. There have been no presents 
 to the palace, from the lord regent, since his proud en-

 trance into Hermanstadt ? ha! none sir? To his — his. — 
 I would say, to the Lady Czerina?" 
 
 " None, madam, to my knowledge," was the reply. 
 
 " Sir, have you seen him?" 
 
 " Whom, gracious queen ? 
 
 " Why, the lord regent, man." 
 
 " No, your highness. But as I stood at the gates, not 
 a minute since, I was frighted to behold his eminence's 
 confessor, some few paces off, slowly approach the palace." 
 
 "Indeed? — hem! — Well, see to the noble Count 
 Pereny." 
 
 Isabella, who, on a memorable occasion, had extracted 
 from the lips of her inebriate paramour, the fact of the 
 black Scipio and Father Dominick, being one and the 
 same individual; and who since was apprised that the 
 African was no other than the Graf Perenv, almost in- 
 stantly surmised the truth, — he, who approached in the 
 garb of the confessor, could not be Pereny, because Pe- 
 reny was at her door. Who then could he be? Isabella 
 guessed, he could be no other than Martinuzzi himself. 
 " So," she muttered to herself, when the man had left the 
 room, " He comes forth, robed in serge, to show his 
 pride and power within these walls, and wists not of the 
 silent melancholy chamber, — the shadowy court he'll 
 grace, when he goes hence." She returned into the inner 
 room. 
 
 Ferraro was standing in the same spot, where she 
 had left him, when she quitted. He had not moved a 
 limb, — and that noble form, now wrecked and defaced 
 by mental tortures, remained in a fixed and absorbed at- 
 titude; his mind was wandering, for relief, under the pres- 
 sure of exquisite suffering, in those visions, which only 
 deepened and refined his sense of woe. It was the 
 breathless hour of noon. All around was still, like the 
 stillness of dreadful preparation. Isabella walked up to 
 Ferraro, — he neither noted her absence or approach. 
 She laid her hand gently on his shoulder.

 " Art thou a man?" she demanded. The accents of 
 her voice thrilled in Ferraro's ears, and roused him from 
 this mental stupefaction. 
 
 " No/' he replied fiercely; " a most rare villain! — a 
 strange disease, (be warned!) which some think madness: 
 'tis catching, like conspiracy. Now that is well, — avoid 
 me, for I burst." 
 
 " Explain thyself, Ferraro, wouldst thou wed, or not, 
 with Czerina?" 
 
 Ferraro made no other reply, than by covering his 
 face with his hands. 
 
 '"Be it at your pleasure, sir," proceeded the queen 
 haughtily; ''receive, here, however, the sanction, or ra- 
 ther the grant, of the Marquis Piadena." She held out 
 the paper, she had surreptitiously obtained from the am- 
 bassador of Austria. 
 
 Ferraro shook his head, and turning away, paced the 
 floor in violent agitation. 
 
 ** Nay, nay, then 'tis likely, I'm to blame," observed 
 Isabella, with ineffable scorn ; " and your light love, even 
 as an early and unusual plant, hath perished o' the coun- 
 tenance of the stars ; — mankind are privileged to shift 
 affections !" 
 
 " What would you have me do?" abruptly demanded 
 Ferraro. 
 
 " Art thou grown blind, that I must answer you ?" 
 exclaimed the queen passionately; '• why the veriest 
 clod, having such cause knocking against his heart, 
 would be more apt ; besides, I've spoken." 
 
 " Let me hear thee again," cried Ferraro; " and show 
 more argument. I'll prove a docile listener, — do not 
 doubt it." The queen's fine countenance darkened into 
 an appearance, at once terrible and beautiful, like the 
 glittering scales of the coiled and venomous serpent. 
 
 " This is beyond belief," she muttered, in a low vexed 
 voice, and moved away. " I've lost my labour : the re- 
 gent will escape, after all !"

 Ferraro followed her. " Come, let me hear the cause," he 
 cried. " It is of death, and ." The queen turned sud- 
 denly on her former lover, and was on the point of break- 
 ing in with some bitter observation, when the words, 
 she would have spoken, were arrested on her lips, as a 
 single, loud, sharp, soul-harrowing cry, repeated in a mo- 
 ment after, in the faint, choked, convulsive, utterance of 
 death, rung with piercing emphasis, through all the 
 palace. The articulate word, " murder!" so awfully re- 
 echoed, from every projection of the building, seemed 
 frightfully applicable to the dreadful matter, Isabella 
 and Ferraro were discussing. — Thrillingly sunk the shrill 
 sound upon the hearts of both. They looked at one 
 another. — Ferraro shook. 
 
 " Who's that calls murder?" he asked, in a faltering 
 and hollow voice. 
 
 Isabella made no direct reply. She pressed her hand 
 upon her forehead. "How my brain whirls!" she said, 
 in low and quivering accents; " Antoine is right; 'twas 
 ' murder /' but why it should be, masters my reason. Do 
 we dream, waking? It were too great a thing else !" She 
 broke off, and retired to the casement absorbed in 
 thought. She threw it open. Her ears caught the 
 loud cheers, with which the giddy populace were hailing 
 the military in the court-yard of the citadel. Sick at the 
 maddening contrast with her own excited feelings, she 
 closed it again. " Can such things be?" she murmured ; 
 " yea," she continued, in a slow and solemn voice ; " and 
 were I now brain-sick, like to yon pale lord, and not a 
 queen, at soul, as in my title; if I were lightly tempered, 
 and my nerved heart, even like the iron bow of destiny, 
 might not be strung to the utmost, did my intents partake, 
 but in the fraction of a grain, of my sex's nature, they 
 might have touched me. But as I am! — yet it is wonder- 
 ful!" 
 
 " Was the voice human, think you?" breathed, rather

 than spoke, Ferraro, without stirring from where he 
 stood. 
 
 Isabella turned from the window, and fixing her eyes 
 on him, with a scornful smile, replied; — "To be sure, it 
 was, — how were it otherwise?" 
 
 " That's true; and yet," objected Ferraro; "I know 
 
 not . In faith it sounded gloomily, i murder V — 
 
 you heard it ?" 
 
 " Surely, and we will learn, anon, the cause," returned 
 the queen, in a composed, if not a cheerful voice. — " In 
 
 the meantime ." 
 
 " Tis very strange!" interrupted Ferraro, shudder- 
 ingly. 
 
 " Nay, nay, let us forget it," observed Isabella. 
 " The horrors of this hour are not to be forgotten, — at 
 least so soon. Doth it not appear miraculous to you? — 
 Forget! I trust I may forget it in my dreams." Just 
 then, an officer of the household entered the ante-room. 
 
 " Hither, sir," said Isabella; — he approached, but 
 paused at the door, wan and mute; Isabella clasped her 
 hands convulsively together, and fixed her eyes on his 
 face. " Speak," she screamed, in a voice she found it 
 impossible to control. The man, however, stood ap- 
 parently confounded. 
 
 " The noble graf," he presently began, " who ." 
 
 "Powers of vengeance!" interrupted the queen; 
 then rushing towards the officer, and stooping her person 
 forward to him, she exclaimed; " What of the count? — 
 tell us, — thou falterest. I bid you deliver your news." 
 And saying these words, the face of Isabella took an ex- 
 pression, so full of meaning, and so prophetic of what 
 she was to hear, that the man gazed on her countenance 
 appalled. At all events, for whatever reason, he could 
 only answer with his looks. 
 
 " Doth he yet hesitate?" murmured Isabella to herself, 
 in an indrawn voice; " then what a scourge hath hell for

 somebody at last! — I catch the whole!" And, indeed, 
 as if by an instantaneous ray of inspiration, the truth 
 flashed upon her mind. She paused , — again looked those 
 inquiries, her tongue refused to articulate, and then im- 
 patiently demanded, under her breath, whether the graf 
 were dead ? 
 
 " Alas! too surely," commenced the officer; " and 
 worse!" — here, as if averse to relate, what must be offen- 
 sive to the sensibility of her sex, he stopped. 
 
 " Aught further, sir?" said the queen, with increasing 
 agitation ; " do I ask in vain? What's this? — He is dead, 
 you say. Aught else?" 
 
 " Madam, he has been stabbed to death," answered 
 the man. Isabella gasped. 
 
 " Was I inspired! How? — Stabbed! and where? — 
 
 So, — possibly , pray you, stand off." Thus saying, 
 
 and without waiting for an answer, she turned away, 
 
 muttering : " If I don't give my heart vent, I shall die. 
 
 Had he done it yesterday, there had been some sense in 
 
 it, and yet 'twas bold. George! George!" she presently 
 
 added with a smile, whose bitter ironical expression 
 
 mocks description; " and was he unto thee, as some god, 
 
 to be reminded of by the sidereal heavens? Methinks, 
 
 Alicia, the miscreated hell had hit it nearer!" Again 
 
 Isabella approached the officer; " I asked," she said, 
 
 huddling the words so thick upon each other, that her 
 
 hearer could hardly catch their sense: " Where was he 
 
 stabbed ? — Not in my palace, sir ? — And for him that dealt 
 
 the blow? — Is he known? — Secured? — Have you laid 
 
 hands on him?" 
 
 " Madam," returned the officer, "he has fled." 
 "Fled! impossible, — where was this? It is not a 
 minute since the graf asked to see us! Good God ! will 
 you speak ?" 
 
 " It was the officer of the guard, madam, who first 
 beheld the corpse." 
 
 " Wait that man hither, sir; and hark ye, bid the

 guards shut the garden gates, — search for the assassin 
 with all diligence; ay, though he be too mighty for you 
 to name, he must be found and shackled." 
 
 The subaltern withdrew. The queen's eyes fell upon 
 Ferraro, — he was standing in a fixed and musing attitude. 
 Astonishment, approaching to stupor, appeared to chain 
 up his faculties. Not a breath or stir gave evidence of 
 existence. 
 
 " How now, Antoine Pereny ?" said Isabella; " what 
 desperate calmness silences thy soul V 
 
 " 'Tis a bloody world this!" ejaculated Ferraro so- 
 lemnly, and with a deep sigh, that almost amounted to a 
 groan. 
 
 "There's mettle in it, sir," returned the queen. " Yet, 
 in sooth, you say not amiss ; it is a bloody world, and 
 on its theatre, an everlasting scene of life and death 
 drags forward, furnishing the joys of time." 
 
 "And there's no help for it!" remarked Ferraro. 
 
 "Trust me, far otherwise, my lord, — but here is my 
 officer. I'll tell you presently." 
 
 She moved away to meet the commander of the guard, 
 who stood in the threshold of the door. " Proceed !" 
 she said, after a solemn pause. 
 
 " On the staircase leading from the garden," began 
 the man. 
 
 " Stay, sir," interrupted the queen ; " do you know 
 if the lord regent have left his home, since noon ?" 
 
 " As I think, no," answered the commander. 
 
 " Never think more, then ; — how ! — villany abroad ! 
 and he keep his chamber? Do you credit it?" 
 
 " Your majesty '." said the officer, under the influence 
 of no small surprise. 
 
 Isabella looked at him sternly. " Pray, you make 
 me understand this matter?" she rejoined, in a calm and 
 commanding voice.

 had found the graf, beside the portals of the palace, 
 weltering in his blood, and in convulsions. His left 
 hand grasped the balustrade, as if, with instinctive im- 
 pulse, he had caught at it, to save himself, in the act 
 of falling. A near examination discovered two deep 
 wounds; — the last had made a passage to the heart. 
 The dirk which had struck the blow, had not been with- 
 drawn : the graf's sword was not unsheathed. On being 
 borne into the vestibule, he expired almost directly. 
 When the commander first beheld him, no soul but one, 
 was near, save such of the household as the horrid cry 
 of murder instantly attracted to the spot. 
 
 " But one ! — what one ? — who ? Have ye that one in 
 irons ?" demanded the queen, with startling rapidity of 
 utterance. 
 
 There was a pause, which the officer appeared ex- 
 tremely unwilling to break. Isabella regarded him im- 
 patiently, for a few seconds ; and then, rushing past him, 
 descended the palace stairs like lightning. The next 
 minute, she made one of a group of awe-struck indivi- 
 duals, who were assembled around the corpse, in the 
 vestibule. She instantly demanded, whether any, be- 
 sides those present, were near, when they first set eyes 
 on the Graf Pereny ? Not a single reply was rendered 
 by the domestics, who looked on each other, with fallen 
 countenances and blanched lips. 
 
 " Nor stir, nor answer me? Ha ! — but no, I will be 
 calm," said Isabella ; and the next moment she repeated 
 her inquiry, with increased vehemence. 
 
 Intimidated, probably, by the earnestness of her man- 
 ner, one of the by-standers stated, though with some 
 reluctance, and pronouncing the dreaded name with a 
 half-whisper, that Father Dominick had been observed, 
 not many paces off, moving along the terrace, in an 
 opposite direction to the scene of slaughter. The 
 speaker added, that it was impossible for the assassin,

 whoever he was, to escape, since the sentinels, in obe- 
 dience to their loud cries, had shut the several gates of 
 the palace-garden, almost at the same instant. 
 
 " Well !" cried Isabella, " and who's now in pursuit? 
 Why gape ye still, each man on his fellow, and drop 
 your coward words in such a sloth, thus one after ano- 
 ther ? Are ye nailed here ? Hence ! — to drag the 
 caitiff to my feet. I swear to you," she added, in a deep 
 and decisive tone, " that Father Dominick is the villain, 
 who did this horrid deed !" 
 
 An indignant murmur followed this announcement. 
 " Ha ! Father Dominick I" exclaimed several of the 
 by-standers, through clenched teeth, and half-closed 
 lips. 
 
 " He is, — I arraign him of the act; — or, if not he," 
 she subjoined, with a peculiar and horrible smile, " a 
 thousand crowns shall recompence that man, who dares 
 but name the homicide." 
 
 The greater number of those present, stood appalled. 
 Some few, however, slunk away, either in awe of their 
 royal mistress, or else in pursuit of the assassin. 
 
 "Why move ye thus, one by one?" exclaimed the 
 queen, passionately. " Fly, every soul of ye ! Your 
 duty should outspeed my voice, — I have need of more 
 than millions such, to do me service. Get ye hence, — 
 and track the assassin of the noble Pereny, — seize him ! — 
 secure his body, dead or alive ; if he resists — kill him ! 
 And when ye have the murdering dog, bring him before 
 us. Away, away, like thoughts !" 
 
 These commands, delivered with that vehemence na- 
 tural to Isabella, and enforced with uncommon energy 
 of gesture, roused the palace household, from the stupe- 
 faction which previously overwhelmed them. All was 
 instant ferment ; several halberts gleamed aloft ; and 
 the excited group rushed tumultuously from the spot, 
 with loud cries. The hall immediately became cleared, 
 and Queen Isabella alone remained, in proximity of all

 MANUSCRIPT XXXI. 257 
 
 that earth retained, of the once haughty and celebrated 
 Peter, Count Pereny. The queen bent over the mur- 
 dered man, in silent thoughtfulness. He was lying upon 
 the pavement, on his back. His arms had fallen listless 
 by his side. His vestments were dabbled with gore, and 
 the floor around was flooded with the same. The in- 
 strument of death had not been withdrawn from the 
 wound, whence (it was his heart) the deep-red stream 
 of life, still continued to bubble forth. What an inscrut- 
 able doom was his ! On the very day of his resuming 
 the style and honours, proper to his lineage, to be thus 
 hurled into eternity. And wherefore ? — and by whom ? — 
 'Twas wondrous strange ! His death so curiously timed 
 too ; — the moment — occasion — manner, — all pointed but 
 to one solution: — and that? "Was he not," mused 
 Isabella, " on the very point of making to me the im- 
 portant communication, he had unwittingly imparted 
 on the preceding night? Would he not have established 
 the truth of his disclosure, by confirmatory particulars, 
 which now the assassin's steel hath sealed in eternal 
 darkness?" That she was already, in a great measure, 
 possessed of the well-nigh incredible circumstance, which 
 Pereny's relation would have unfolded, the murderer, 
 whoever he was, could not guess — whoever he was ! The 
 promised revelation, involved charges of damning import 
 to one man, in particular. Who, but he, in all Tran- 
 sylvania, could have an interest to stifle in blood, the 
 fated breath of him, who was about to lay bare, to the 
 widow of John of Zapola, her mighty injuries ? Who but 
 he, would profit by the hushing up the evidence of his 
 treasons ? Who, but he, was on the spot ? 
 
 The connection between the death of Pereny, and the 
 approach of Martinuzzi, under the guise of Father Domi- 
 nick, adopted in a moment of extreme and engrossing emo- 
 tion, afforded a circumstantial evidence of the prelate's 
 guilt, which, even had Isabella been more collected, her 
 understanding would not have allowed her to doubt.

 With such thoughts whirling through her fertile brain, 
 did Isabella mutely contemplate the upturned and rigid 
 countenance of the corpse, at her feet ; — she stood, like 
 the iron man with ribs of steel, described by Spencer. 
 Neither awe, nor pity, nor compunction touched a heart, 
 indurated, by the searing wrath of woman's jealousy, to 
 the hardness of the nether millstone, and over the ruins 
 of whose every feeling, strode crowned revenge in arms, 
 and cased in triple adamant. Isabella looked not on the 
 casualty, which had just intervened, as an intimation from 
 a mysterious Providence. It scared not her ravenous 
 soul, from hovering in imagination o'er its prey, but 
 rather would have presented an additional incentive to 
 revenge, had she required it. She felicitated herself not 
 a little on the purchase, she had obtained over Ferraro, 
 by the opportune occurrence of his father's murder, and 
 resolved to convert the most hallowed feelings of the 
 human heart, into the instruments of her diabolical pur- 
 pose ;. .to make them her prime agents, in effecting the 
 destruction of her fated victims. Intently did Isabella 
 gaze on the lifeless visage, and scan those features, so 
 lately animated, where death, but not natural death, had 
 set his indelible seal. Presently her rolling eye, in freez- 
 ing intuition, fastened on the hilt of the fatal dirk, 
 whose blade was still buried in the bosom of Pereny ; 
 when, through the dark gore, with which it was stained 
 and clotted, she fancied, she descried, in the midst of 
 elaborate chasing, certain minute characters, exquisitely 
 executed in relief; — she peered closer over the reeking 
 spectacle, and then seizing hold of the dreadful instru- 
 ment, forcibly extricated it from its ensanguined sheath, 
 regardless of the clear fresh stream, which spurted forth 
 at the ghastly opening. Isabella held up the weapon 
 near to her orb of vision. One single word was engraved 
 on that hilt, and the exultant expression of inward satis- 
 faction, which kindled meteor and unnatural light through 
 the eyes, and over the pallid face of Isabella, as she

 decyphered it, mocks the power of language to depict. 
 For a second, she preserved a fixed and abstracted atti- 
 tude, and through her closed teeth, audibly drew in her 
 breath ; then depositing the crimson dripping weapon 
 beneath her robe, wholly unmindful of the gouts of gore, 
 which stained her hands and linen, with a bent brow, 
 stern and flashing eye, and an appalling smile upon her 
 compressed and tintless lip, the implacable lady left the 
 vestibule, and ascending the staircase, rejoined Ferraro. 
 Upon entering the room, she found him seated on that low 
 ottoman, commemorated in a former manuscript, — his 
 face was half hid within his hands, as they rested on his 
 knees, and he was seemingly wrapped up in meditation, 
 whose very intenseness bordered on stupor. 
 
 Isabella glared on him for about a minute, with an eye, 
 expressive of scorn — " Thou ashen slave !" she muttered 
 to herself inaudibly, "Thou struck pale fool ! or else, — 
 thou mightst have been — how I once looked upon him !" 
 
 Ferraro raised his head — " Madam, may I begone?" 
 he said, half rising from his recumbent position. 
 
 M Surely not, Antoine," replied the queen, casting her- 
 self beside him ; " We will now resume our talk." 
 
 " Talk!" cried Ferraro, " how can you imagine it? I 
 cannot, — nor think ; — my soul shakes ; — prithee, let me 
 begone." 
 
 With these words, he again offered to retire, but 
 Isabella impelled him, with gentle compulsion, to retain 
 his place near her. " Nay, Pereny, keep your seat — I 
 have news for you." 
 
 Ferraro made no further effort to depart. " I am sick 
 o' the world," he cried, listlessly sinking back on the easy 
 cushion. 
 
 Isabella turned to him, and fixing on him a glance, full 
 of earnestness, took his hand in hers, and while her form 
 seemed to dilate before his astonished eyes, she thus, in 
 a deep, solemn and earnest voice, took up the discourse — 
 " You said, but now, it is a bloody world, and you were

 right, Antoine,- — it is. The slayer and the slain have sat 
 together, in churches, council chambers, and on thrones. 
 'Tis a deep mystery, my friend, but so it is. Full many 
 men have died, been murdered, struck, sir, and yet no 
 blow been seen for it. We bleed away, with heart strings 
 cut and torn, for who is he, that is not stabbed at the 
 core ? Some still writhe on, while life ebbs drop by drop, 
 but, slow or sudden, all die inwardly. There are, ay, 
 trust me sir, there are a thousand wonderous ways to 
 smite* — the wearied, and the heavy-laden own it." The 
 look, the attitude, the voice of Isabella, all concurred, 
 while she spoke thus, to overawe her listener. 
 
 " Why this to me ?" he said, with faltering accents. 
 
 " Because, thou art struck at, yet forgivest it," re- 
 turned the queen, impetuously. " Thou art wounded, 
 sir, despoiled, stabbed to death ; or, if it be not death, 
 those gnawings at the primal seat of life, it is a living 
 torture, which exceeds ripping of veins and poison. Oh, 
 to die, how easy were it, under the weight of human in- 
 juries! the great and difficult task is his who dares last them 
 out, who scorns to shrink under fate's strongest strokes, 
 boldly confronts insult and wrong with silence, with 
 heroic patience, and deceptive smiles, — lives on in tor- 
 ments, but revenges all ont." Here she paused, leaning, 
 in her earnestness, so close to her companion, that he felt 
 her breath warm upon his face. 
 
 "I stir no more in that we spake of," cried Ferraro, 
 abruptly, " so let it pass." 
 
 Isabella looked at him for an instant with a quiet, in- 
 tent, and steady eye ; and then, without noticing what he 
 had just spoken, continued, in a more composed tone, 
 but with no less solemnity than before — "Two charac- 
 ters, throughout all life, play opposite parts — the op- 
 pressor and the oppressed. Such is the universal code, 
 and all the common privilege, left to mortals, is a bare

 choice. The brave man at once makes his election, and 
 adheres to it ; whilst the ignoble herd still shift their 
 policy, like the inconstant vane, and prove the pains, by 
 turns, of tyranny and of endurance." 
 
 "What matters it?" cried Ferraro, with some emotion, 
 " the world is a wide prison, and those that find not, 
 forge themselves the gyves that wear them ; but now, 
 something is wrong already ; again be wise, and let me 
 depart." 
 
 " Well, Antoine," exclaimed the queen, at the same 
 time rising impatiently from her seat, " wert thou en- 
 thralled by such gyves thou speak'st of, wouldst not 
 shiver them ? — Look up, and answer, man. — Wert thou, 
 Mark Antoine, the oppressed, and thy heart cut through 
 with galling and unlicensed force — didst thou stand 
 rifled here of one thou lovedst, — the golden promise of thy 
 young hopes blasted — wouldst kiss the axe that levelled 
 thee to earth ?" 
 
 To an appeal urged with such heat, Ferraro hardly 
 knew what to reply. 
 
 "To what thy siren voice would urge me on, I guess," 
 he presently began, " but, madam " 
 
 " Light, wavering man !" interrupted Isabella, her 
 eyes sparkling indignantly, " of what base clay art 
 fashioned ? By Heavens ! I doubt, the blood that warms 
 thy ignoble heart, would scarce suffice to shape a blush, 
 upon the cheek of a green girl." 
 
 " Deem not," said Ferraro, " I purpose to endure that 
 tyranny thou hintest at. But you have forgot, lady, how 
 I have a father, the first of Hungary's nobles, without 
 whose concurrence I cannot stir in this. I will consult 
 him. Pereny shall instruct me how to act." 
 
 " Marc Antoine Pereny !" exclaimed the queen, in a 
 voice of supernatural grandeur, at the same time motion- 
 ing her finger, to enforce attention. " Would refer 
 your conduct to your father's counsel, go below — his 
 blood, yet unappeased, will demand of thee a noble ven-

 geance ; his locked and inorganic jaws will, in the name 
 of God, and of your country, and of all laws, human and 
 divine, command you to be a man !" 
 
 Ferraro shuddered. He would have spoken, but 
 several seconds his lips refused their office. " Holy 
 Mother of Heaven ! — what mean you ?" he at length 
 asked, in a tone of forced and terrible calmness. 
 
 " Your root is withered up ; Pereny 's dead, and left 
 you for a hatchment — this!" — and at the word, Isa- 
 bella deliberately drew forth the blood-dripping dirk, 
 which lodged in the folds of her garment, and flung it 
 upon the table. 
 
 Ferraro started up, and rushing to where it lay, bent, 
 with fixed muscles and ghastly complexion, over the 
 weapon. A deep pause of a minute ensued, ere he found 
 voice. " Whence comes this gory tincture?" he at 
 length demanded, in that tone of congealed horror, 
 caused by those vague and indescribable doubts, which 
 the sudden apparition, at such a moment, naturally sug- 
 gested. 
 
 The depth of the hollow voice, in which the reply was 
 rendered, was like what we attribute to an utterance, not 
 of this world. 
 
 "It is from your father's heart, Antoine ; — all that 
 remains to earth of Peter Count Pereny, lies stretched in 
 the porch below, on the cold ground. There, feed thy 
 blood-shot eyes, and then turn marble !" 
 
 Ferraro was indeed horror-stricken. He recoiled se- 
 veral feet, and then for awhile stood aghast. Frantic 
 with emotion, he presently snatched up the instrument, 
 and, with a maddened voice, said — " Who hath done 
 this? Tell me, if you know, that, ere I lay my father in 
 consecrated earth, I may revenge him." 
 
 " Who is 't ? — who should it be, but heV replied Isa- 
 bella. 
 
 " Ha ! whom ?" demanded Ferraro. 
 
 " The regent !" was the answer.

 MANUSCRIPT XXXI. 263 
 
 " Speak it at large — Cardinal Martinuzzi?" 
 
 " Is there another regent ? If you can doubt my word, 
 read, son of Pereny, what red name's engraven on the 
 heft of the instrument, extracted from thy father's corpse, 
 and spell the will of Heaven." 
 
 Ferraro, in freezing obedience, raised the weapon before 
 his glazed orb. — " Martinuzzi !" he murmured, in half- 
 smothered accents of mingled dismay and horror. There 
 was mutual silence for awhile. It was broken by Isa- 
 bella. 
 
 " Tis well," she cried, " your funeral tears do turn to 
 fire, to blast the sceptred slayer." 
 
 " Mark me, madam !" replied Ferraro ; and his stern 
 utterance denoted the strength of his resolution, — " were 
 he ten times regent, and all tortures tyranny e'er invented 
 were let loose upon me for it, he should not sleep an- 
 other night. The man, who, in such bloody case, takes 
 up the name and title of his ancestors, is bound to ex- 
 press his sorrow, not by tears, but by avenging his father's 
 massacre. The son of Pereny" — and Ferraro's eyes 
 shot fire as he spoke — " will, by the same blow, that 
 requites his private injuries, emancipate his country, from 
 the yoke of a tyrant !" 
 
 The deep and steady voice, with which these words 
 were delivered, evidenced the determined purpose of 
 Ferraro's soul, and seemed to evince, that the transports 
 of passion, which had not long before wrought on him, to 
 the brink of madness, were for a time subsided. His feel- 
 ings were tempered, and, so to speak, solemnized, by the 
 occasion. The dread bolt, just launched forth against 
 his house, roused him to the encounter. He felt, that he 
 stood pledged to the world, that the blood, which flowed 
 in his veins should not be poured forth unrequited, and 
 the anticipation of obtaining that " wild justice," which 
 his honourable and justifiable indignation almost autho- 
 rized, strengthened his nerves, and induced a train of 
 thinking and feeling, that was most grateful, when com-

 pared to his previous irritable condition. It possessed 
 the like soothing effects on the mind, as if, in meditating 
 a nicely-measured retribution, he were acting under the 
 influence of duty. 
 
 Ferraro had hardly done speaking, when a dissonant 
 buzz and outcry, that had for some time been gathering 
 in the distance, approached close to the exterior of the 
 palace. Loud voices were heard, exclaiming, " Venge- 
 ance on the murderer !" — " Vengeance and Pereny !" — 
 " Vengeance and liberty !" 
 
 " Have they laid hands on him ?" thought the queen, 
 as she stepped to the casement, and looked forth into the 
 wardens. There, all was riot, uproar, and confusion. 
 Between two and three hundred persons, mostly armed, 
 were seen advancing towards the palace. 
 
 " Hark ! there is tumult," said the queen. " Let us 
 descend, Antoine, and meet the multitude, to prevent 
 misapprehension. Follow me." 
 
 Ferraro did as he was directed. Holding the dagger 
 with a firm and strained gripe, he moved forward through 
 the long ante-chamber, or gallery, to the grand staircase. 
 Thence he made but few steps to the bottom of the flight, 
 and then threw himself on one knee, before the slaughtered 
 body of his sire. At that instant, there was an inburst of 
 several men, through the vestibule, into the spacious and 
 lofty entrance-hall of the palace. Brandishing their 
 arms aloft, with fury in their hearts, and loud vocifera- 
 tions on their tongues, they demanded the murderer of 
 Pereny, to be delivered up into their hands. The origin 
 of this extraordinary tumult, we will now proceed to 
 explain. 
 
 The vague dread, which the royal household, in 
 common with every other soul in Hermanstadt, had of 
 Father Dominick, detained those in the vestibule, for 
 several seconds, after the queen had issued her orders 
 for his arrest ; but the feeling of horror entertained, at 
 the character of the confessor, was, in no instance, re-

 deemed by the slightest particle of regard; and, urged 
 by the natural indignation of men, called upon to assist 
 in the seizing of a murderer, all present entered upon 
 the pursuit of the mysterious father, with right good 
 will. 
 
 On their issuing forth into the gardens, the monk was 
 observed moving at a quick rate far down the broad 
 avenue, leading from the palace. The simultaneous com- 
 mand to stop or die, which rent the air, appeared to 
 afford to the object of their hallowed wrath, the first 
 intimation of their being in quest of him. Ere the echo 
 of their voices died away, the confessor had turned aside, 
 from the more open path he before pursued, into an 
 oblique avenue, and was instantly lost to sight. 
 
 The palace gardens were of considerable extent, and 
 were bounded, in part, by the royal edifice itself, in 
 part, by the course of the river Zibin, and were else- 
 where ci r cumscribed with a broad and lofty stone wall. 
 The officers and retainers, therefore, believing themselves 
 ultimately sure of their quarry, halted to consult on their 
 best mode of hunting it down. Pursuant to their plan 
 of operations, which seemed to ascertain the general 
 safety, if it had little else to recommend it, the whole 
 body divided into small parties, and repaired to opposite 
 points of the compass at the extremity of the gardens. 
 Ensweeping first the intervening distances, they pro- 
 ceeded, at a common signal, to converge in the direction 
 of the palace. Soon they entered upon a portion of the 
 garden, which, according to the taste of that age, was 
 arranged with uncommon care. Arbours, bowers, grottos, 
 now covered with a hoar and crystal foliage ; statues, 
 distributed in admired order, presented themselves at 
 every vista. The terraces on this side the platform, just 
 reflected the terraces on the other, whilst repeated 
 flights of steps were made to terminate in the cultivated 
 parterre, or were mirrored in the artificial fountain, whi- 
 ther they conducted.

 Certain of the household, to whom devolved the task of 
 scouring this ornamented space of ground, on turning 
 into a cross avenue, found themselves, to their own con- 
 sternation, within view of the monk. For a moment, to 
 a man, they recoiled ; but, confident in their numbers, 
 and acquiring fresh courage, from witnessing the flight 
 of the ghostly assassin, at their approach, with boisterous 
 halloos, they almost immediately resumed the pursuit. 
 This announcement, which shook the welkin, had the effect 
 of accellerating the advance of other of the confederates, 
 and it was not many minutes, ere between twenty and 
 thirty persons were directly on the trail of the fugitive. 
 Every instant, one or other caught a glimpse of his dark 
 and flowing robe, and it appeared inevitable, that he 
 must be shortly brought to bay. Some few bullets were 
 discharged, which ploughed up the ground at his feet. 
 
 The party was gradually gaining upon him, when he 
 descended a flight of steps, whence the thoroughfare di- 
 verged, at a sharp angle, into two separate paths. Both 
 of these were circuitous, and, sweeping round a broken 
 dingle of some extent, covered with a thick underwood 
 of evergreen, again became united at the base of a cor- 
 responding flight of steps, that conducted to the main 
 avenue of the gardens. At this place, owing to the 
 abruptness of the curve, his pursuers lost sight of the 
 monk. On reaching the fork, they divided their small 
 troop, and rapidly measured the distance to the meeting 
 of the paths beyond the dingle, where they ascended the 
 opposite flight of steps, just mentioned. 
 
 Having now obtained an extensive range of vision, 
 they could perceive the other parties, hastening from all 
 quarters towards them, but the object of their pursuit 
 was no where to be seen ; — they were at fault. Sud- 
 denly, a wild cry broke from the dingle of copse- 
 wood, the circumition of which we have detailed. They 
 could distinguish fierce exclamations, and, apparently, 
 the jar of angry voices. They turned back, and their

 movements were speedily quickened, and their attention 
 attracted to the right spot, by the clashing- of swords. 
 It now became evident, that persons were engaged in 
 mortal struggle, somewhere in the midst of that thick 
 underwood. The party of pursuers burst from every di- 
 rection, through the copsewood that obstructed their 
 passage. Suddenly, the clashing ceased, when, just 
 as the foremost of the party attained a little space of 
 more open level, the monk himself abruptly brushed 
 past him, and, taking advantage of a scarce-trod and 
 devious track, with which the other was unacquainted, 
 rapidly thridded the intervening cover, to the common 
 pathway, and was again, for a period, lost to view. 
 
 About the same time, other of the officers of the house- 
 hold arrived at that level before mentioned, and, on 
 looking around, they descried a cavalier, prostrate and 
 bathed in blood, upon the earth, whose splendid accou- 
 trements at once proclaimed him to be noble, and a 
 foreigner. On approaching nearer, with the view of 
 accosting him, it was discovered that he had swooned 
 away. They proceeded to raise him, and, in the act, a 
 fresher colour visited his cheek. His mind appeared to 
 be slowly reviving to a sense of outward circumstances ; 
 while, still in a state of demi-consciousness, his eyes 
 seemed to follow some obscure and fleeting object, and 
 broken and energetic expressions escaped from him, at 
 intervals. 
 
 " Wouldst marry into royal families ? — ha ! haughty 
 Hungarian ! — one blow ! — not dead yet, and I struck 
 so home ? — there's to thy heart ! proud exile ! — go, 
 join Jerome Lascus' child, in — in — in — I tell you 'tis 
 false, I did it not ! — Monk ! arch dissembler ! fiend ! 
 ha! — Martinuzzi! — ha! ha! ha!" 
 
 Infinitely startled at the import of this mysterious lan- 
 guage, which seemed to burst from the wounded man's 
 lips with uncontrollable violence, those, who were wit- 
 nesses of his half delirious exclamations, accompanied as

 they were, with horrible contortions and furious gestures, 
 in accordance with his words, judged it best to convey 
 him beneath the palace roof; and they were the rather 
 inclined to adopt this course, as they presently ascer- 
 tained, from some of their party, that the object of their 
 marvel was no other than the Marquis of Piadena, some 
 time ambassador, but, at present, prisoner-of-war in 
 Hermanstadt. 
 
 From the contemplation of Castaldo's guilty ravings, 
 let us turn our attention to Father Dominick, who, 
 taking an oblique line, towards a small portal in the 
 wall, and stealing a glance over his shoulder, descried more 
 than a score of persons close at his heels, as he gained 
 the gate. In the same breathing point of time, two of 
 his hunters darted along an intersecting path, to cut off 
 his escape. His fate would no longer have been doubt- 
 ful, but that the person of the confessor was " hedged" 
 with such awe and horror, that these two waited for the 
 co-operation of their comrades, ere they would venture 
 to " act their will." During their momentary indecision, 
 the monk drew out a small pass-key, and applied it to 
 the lock. Owing to rust or disuse, the key turned in 
 the wards with difficulty ; still, though they saw his 
 escape at hand, and that more than twenty of his pur- 
 suers had come up, not an individual had the temerity 
 to seize upon him. The monk exerted all his skill and 
 force — in vain. 
 
 In this emergency of danger, one of the party, bolder 
 than the rest, laid his hand on the door. Instantly 
 quitting his own hold, the monk grasped the fellow's 
 hand in one of his, while, with the other, he half raised 
 his hood. The man uttered a low cry of surprise, at the 
 same moment that the monk, releasing his hold, caused 
 him to stagger back among his confederates, who, in that 
 sympathy of indefinable dread, which (ever since the 
 stratagem of the rustic god,) has gone by the name of

 panic,* to a man recoiled. The door opened, and al- 
 ready the confessor was through the aperture, when a 
 general rush (defeating its own object) was made to seize 
 him by his girdle, " Stop, or die !" was uttered, in fear- 
 ful proximity, to his ears. Despite the command, he 
 slipped the fastenings of the belt, and passed through the 
 opening. Several reeled backwards, holding, in their 
 tenacious grasp, the loosened belt, while the monk flung 
 the door back, and turned the key. Here, however, a 
 yell of fury welcomed him, and he beheld a multitude 
 bearing down upon the spot, from the piazzas of the 
 palace. Fetching a deep breath, he directed his course 
 towards that ruinous porchway, which, in former manu- 
 scripts, hath made the scene of our changeful drama, 
 and was not long in reaching the desired haven. 
 
 On observing him take refuge in that desolate spot, 
 the multitude set up a triumphant hurrah, conceiving 
 him now at the term of his flight, and utterly in their 
 power. The persons in quest of the ghostly fugitive 
 were not confined to the official retainers of the palace. 
 
 Pereny, for some days past, had been recruiting the 
 strength of his partizans against the struggle, which he 
 foreboded, but in which it was decreed, by a higher 
 Power, that he should take no part. His existence had 
 long been secretly known to hundreds ; and, during the 
 whole of the preceding night, unmindful of that unerring 
 javelin, that already hurtled in the air, he had been con- 
 spiring, with many of the inferior magnats, and other of 
 his adherents, to accomplish the restitution of the crown 
 of Transylvania, to the rightful descendant of John of 
 Zapola. 
 
 Alas ! where was he the next day ? — In that world 
 beyond, where kingdoms and crowns deceive not ; where 
 he would know what bubbles they are, which are so

 proudly borne on the floods of time, to be dissipated 
 into the breathless ocean of eternity. 
 
 The name of Pereny was a tower of strength. That 
 nobleman was the richest and most illustrious subject 
 in the kingdom ; and, notwithstanding the many errors 
 conspicuous in his conduct, the natural partiality and 
 attachment of his vassals supposed, and even magnified, 
 his personal importance. Enough of time had since 
 passed away, to wipe out whatever motives for enmity 
 or rivalship his unstable politics had formerly afforded ; 
 and many furious and ambitious spirits now joined, heart 
 and hand, to support the graf in his project of subverting 
 the government, who, in other days, would not have 
 interchanged the commonest terms of courtesy with him. 
 " Time the mighty, withers wrath away."* 
 
 The rule of Martinuzzi, though received by those of 
 the lowest rank with eager approbation, was far from 
 giving the like satisfaction to the turbulent and factious 
 aristocracy, many of whom were jealous of the ascendant 
 which he had acquired in the councils of the nation. 
 Their train of conspiracy pointed to the overthrow of his 
 system of government, and the substituting of Iwan to 
 the possession of the vacant dignity. All being prepared, 
 nothing remained but to strike the blow ; and the ad- 
 vance of the Richter before the walls of Hermanstadt, 
 was determined on, as the signal of explosion. But all 
 the while that this plot was maturing, under the counsel 
 and co-operation of Pereny, that nobleman, true to his 
 fluctuating character, did not the less maintain a nego- 
 ciation with Martinuzzi, and thus kept open for himself 
 a constant door of retreat. He was occupied in coun- 
 termining the very measure, at which he laboured most 
 earnestly, and, had not Martinuzzi so decisively broke 
 off the long projected union, between the Lady Czerina 
 and Antoine, he would have betrayed, and ruined the

 object of, the conspiracy, even in the moment of its ap- 
 parent successful consummation. His loyalty to his 
 king, his duty to his country, and, what was more, his 
 envy of the power, which Martin uzzi had acquired, would 
 have yielded to the aggrandizement of his family, and 
 the happiness of his son. But when his double treachery 
 did not infer these consequences, his aspiring mind be- 
 came filled with indignation, at the thoughts of the regal 
 dignity descending to Czerina, and he determined on 
 overturning that domination, to which he could not sub- 
 mit. On the reef of Pereny's tergiversation were the 
 fortunes of I wan, as had been those of his father, in 
 danger of striking ; but also, the rocks, which lay ex- 
 posed, above the stream of events, threatened a difficult 
 and dangerous navigation. 
 
 What means the conspirators possessed, at all pro- 
 portioned to their important enterprise, history has given 
 us small clue to ascertain. It is in proof, that they had 
 entered into a close confederacy with the Turk, but even 
 such an alliance could hardly have presented a reason- 
 able hope of a successful issue. The fame and splen- 
 dour of Martinuzzi's last triumph could not fail of at- 
 tracting, such multitudes of adventurers into his service, 
 as must put him in a condition of taking the field against 
 the sultan ; besides, the tremendous lesson, lately taught 
 to Austria, was calculated to strike a wholesome terror 
 into the councils of the Ottoman, who would naturally 
 pause, ere he provoked a similar castigation. The au- 
 thority of Martinuzzi was established on the basis of his 
 military genius and pre-eminent talents for government, 
 and, with few exceptions, the vows, wishes, and hopes 
 of the Magyari and the sons of Erdely, were turned on 
 their regent as their future king, at once the destined 
 liberator of Hungary, and the vindicator of the independ- 
 ence and dominion of Transylvania. " The head and 
 front of" the present rash enterprise, — the man who 
 alone could raise the standard of revolt, with the re-

 motest chance of success, had suffered a signal defeat, 
 and was a prisoner in the dungeons of his enemy. His 
 prospects seemed utterly blasted ; but when, in addition 
 to this calamitous state of affairs, the life of the Graf 
 Pereny, the prime mover in his cause, and his principal 
 ground of trust, was suddenly extinguished, the fates 
 themselves seemed to have irreversibly taken their side 
 against him, and set their last seal upon the ruin of the 
 Richter Iwan. — " Sic Fatis videbatur." 
 
 But time and chance happeneth to all sublunary things, 
 which do not fall out according to the probability of 
 second causes, but by the appointment of an overruling 
 Providence, which, in those situations where human pru- 
 dence and invention would utterly despair, interposeth 
 unforeseen expedients, and confoundeth all calculation 
 by the event. The seeds of revolution, so carefully sown 
 by Pereny, and his adherents, though apparently cast 
 upon a sterile soil, and choked by the weeds of untoward 
 circumstances, were destined to spring up with a sudden 
 and unexpected growth, and, like some tropical plant, to 
 blossom, at once, in a flourishing maturity. " Nothing 
 flieth swifter than fame," was said or sung by the poet of 
 old, the truth of which observation might well be ex- 
 emplified, from what was transpiring at Hermanstadt, 
 about the period, unto which the successive stages of this 
 fitful history, have at length conducted us. As if winged 
 with telegraphic celerity, rumours were already afloat, 
 that the graf, Peter Pereny, the flower of Hungarian 
 chivalry, for so long time, falsely, supposed not to exist, 
 had been cut down, at the threshold of the queen's palace, 
 by the base and treacherous hand of their ancient abhor- 
 rence, Father Dominick. 
 
 The immediate partizans of Pereny, meanwhile, and 
 the few others, trusted with the secret of the conspiracy, 
 and advised of the graf's intention, to repair to the palace 
 that morning, and announce to her highness, the peculiar 
 circumstances, connected with her son's existence, and

 the particulars of the projected insurrection in his favour, 
 could hardly have been more stunned, if a thunder-bolt 
 had fallen at their feet. Deprived of their leader, they 
 felt their courage die away, and their arms fall from their 
 hands. 
 
 Not more than one or two were cognizant of the real 
 mystery, appertaining to the leaden crucifix ; and the rest 
 argued, from the circumstance of his confessor perpetrat- 
 ing the bloody deed, that Martinuzzi must have by some 
 means or other, become privy to their proceedings, and 
 had taken that decisive mode of blighting their plot, in its 
 first formless embrion. Moreover, owing to the profound 
 secrecy, with which Pereny had concerted his measure, 
 the greater part of those, who acted under him, were 
 strangers to the object, at which he aimed. Under these 
 circumstances, but two opposite courses lay open to the 
 conspirators — the one was to abandon their revolutionary 
 projects, and each man to keep his own secret of how far 
 he stood committed, which it was not otherwise likely the 
 regent would arrive at. The alternative was, to preci- 
 pitate their measures, which indeed, the universal horror 
 conceived at the assassination of the graf, and the favour- 
 able augury of the victorious troops, having been left 
 without the city walls, seemed to recommend. This latter 
 expedient, it was decided, after a hasty and imperfect 
 consultation, to adopt. Emissaries were immediatelv 
 despatched to every quarter of the city, with instruction 
 to excite and inflame the minds of the inhabitants, by the 
 dissemination of all manner of libels, upon the character 
 and government of Martinuzzi ; and then, by stirring the 
 populace up to overt acts of mutiny and riot, the serious 
 tendency of which they were incapable of discerning, to 
 compromit them to the revolution, which their own blind 
 violence would effectuate. 
 
 To return to where we left the confessor in full retreat.

 entrance of the dilapidated porchway, his pursuers con-

 fidently calculated on securing their prisoner, and the 
 reader will readily sympathize with, though we can never 
 describe, their excess of amazement, when, on reaching 
 the spot, they found no corporeal traces whatever, of the 
 fugitive. All the stories so long current of the monk's 
 diabolical endowments, flashed, with the force of convic- 
 tion, across their minds, and there were few among that 
 discomfited and open-mouthed rabble, but who devoutly 
 gave him credit for having evaporated into his native 
 nitrogen. Their very blood seemed to freeze in their 
 veins, as, crossing themselves, they shrunk back, in terror. 
 This opinion, which appearances certainly not a little 
 countenanced, might have been universal, if it had not 
 happened, that one or two present had been previously 
 made aware, by Pereny, of the existence of a secret door 
 somewhere about the ruin, and, whether they considered 
 it unphilosophical we cannot say, but they felt disinclined 
 to attribute the absence of the monk to a mysterious 
 evanishment, when it might be more rationally accounted 
 for, from natural causes. In few words, they mentioned 
 to the incensed, but horrified body of pursuers, their 
 strong suspicions, that Father Dominick had escaped 
 their hands, by means of a mine or subterraneous way, 
 which led from thence, into the palace. On receiving 
 this natural explanation, of what otherwise seemed so 
 frightfully inexplicable, a wild and tremendous shout of 
 fury arose from the people, who were fast assembling. 
 The cry of " to the palace! to the palace!" echoed on 
 all hands. It was forthwith determined to post some half 
 dozen of their number, as a guard of observation upon the 
 spot, whilst the rest, reinforced by multitudes of muti- 
 neers, who, like bees, kept pouring from ali points, in 
 that direction, made sure of the ultimate caption of the 
 assassin, by investing the palace. Moving with rapidity 
 towards the gardens, the conspirators every where joining 
 them, they made fast the postern, and left a small party 
 to watch it. Their numbers, which were increasing every

 moment as they advanced, amounted, by the time they 
 reached the gates of the palace, to several hundreds, and 
 the roar, like that of a herd of raging; wolves, was still 
 waxing more universal and louder, as they burst into the 
 vestibule, in the unceremonious mode we related, some 
 page or two ago. Such as had been in the confidence of 
 Pereny, immediately drew several paces back, with an in- 
 voluntary impulse of respect for Ferraro's feelings, as 
 they beheld him kneeling beside the body, of his murdered 
 sire. This new theme of sympathy got whispered from 
 voice to voice, and echoed from rank to rank, and spread- 
 ing with electric rapidity, increased still more the rage 
 of the riotous assemblage. 
 
 As the " most sweet" vox populi, hushed for a time, 
 again found itself a vent, — Queen Isabella reached the 
 scene of action. " What mean these clamours? — this 
 outrage? What want you with us?" she demanded, in 
 commanding tone, of the rude mob ; at the same time 
 advancing into the midst of the crowded hall. The vital 
 energy with which, at the moment, her whole form 
 seemed to be animated suited well with, and gave 
 entire effect to, that regal air, which ever characterised 
 her slightest movement. 
 
 " We seek for the person of the murdering villain who 
 stabbed the Graf Pereny, whose noble blood is not ditch- 
 water, that it should flow unavenged ;" replied one, 
 who took upon himself to be the spokesman of the in- 
 surgents. 
 
 " My people are in quest of that man you name," 
 replied the queen. Knew I where he had hidden him, 
 doubt not, but I would instantly deliver him to the tri- 
 bunal of justice ; then, wherefore this uproar?" 
 
 " That's not what we require," returned the other ; 
 ** the sword of justice is like to fall light upon his head, 
 whom Martinuzzi favours. Your highness must e'en 
 surrender the assassin into our hands — we are bent on 
 justice, do ye see, and justice we will have, after our

 own reading. The universal demand, in every corner of 
 the streets, is blood for blood ! Vengeance on the mur- 
 derer of Pereny !" 
 
 The vindictive cry was instantly repeated, by the 
 mouths of several in the hall, and echoed back, from ten 
 hundred lips, without the palace walls. The vault of 
 heaven seemed to return the terrible denunciation, and 
 Ferraro, who, until that moment, had appeared utterly 
 lost in the depth and abstraction of his grief, took up the 
 word, with bitter and fierce emphasis. " Hearken to 
 me, my friends," he cried, starting from his recumbent 
 posture. There was a momentary pause, which the 
 deep and solemn feelings pervading, as by a common 
 chord of sympathy, the whole of that congregated mul- 
 titude, rendered sublime. It passed ; — a hush of expecta- 
 tion next ensued, and in the deep silence which followed, 
 Ferraro moved forward, with a bold and manly grace, to 
 address the people. 
 
 " You prompt me well, my friends 1" he exclaimed, in 
 a voice of dignity and firmness. " It was this dagger 
 spilt the life-stream of the great Pereny, — with the same 
 weapon will I, his son, strike the assassin to the heart. 
 Blood for blood ! — Vengeance on the murderer of my 
 father!" 
 
 At that instant, a sort of confusion arose without the 
 doors. An attendant spoke some few words, in a low 
 voice, to Isabella. 
 
 "How! — wounded!" she replied, more audibly- — 
 " hem ! — here ! — do you say ? — surely ; — convey the 
 marquis hither." 
 
 There ensued an obscure, low, and reiterated exclama- 
 tion, and the vast multitude rolled on either side, like 
 the foaming surges on the bosom of a lake, to admit the 
 procession of certain of the royal household, bearing the 
 languid form of Castaldo. His wound had been 
 staunched, but his countenance was extremely pale, and 
 had all the fixed monumental character of death. Blood

 stains marked their route, as they carried their well-nigh 
 unconscious burthen into the middle of the hall, and 
 placed him gently on a seat. At his feet, lay extended 
 the livid gory spectacle of Pereny. Planted before him, 
 like some avenging minister, his doublet splashed with 
 blood, his outstretched arm, upholding the horrible in- 
 strument of crime, his brows bent, and his features rigid 
 with resolution, stood Marc Antoine. Nearer still, Isa- 
 bella, as an accusing spirit, was stationed, fixing her 
 eyes, that, like light, seemed to pierce through the 
 darkest recesses of his soul, upon his countenance ; and 
 on every side, was one vast array of armed men, with 
 brandished weapons, whose visages reflected, in stern 
 sympathy, the sentiment, which, on his entrance into the 
 hall, the son of the graf thundered in his ears ; "Blood 
 for blood ! — Vengeance on the murderer of my father !" 
 
 Castaldo, already faint with loss of blood, seemed 
 struck aghast at the solemn scene, into the midst of 
 which he had been unexpectedly transported; his eye 
 wildly wandered from one object to the other. A fearful 
 convulsion, at once of soul and body, shook him, and 
 uttering a choaked groan, he sunk down in a swoon, from 
 off his seat. By Isabella's direction, delivered in an 
 under voice to her attendants, he was immediately con- 
 veyed, in his insensible condition, into an adjacent apart- 
 ment, and secured. 
 
 The awful and important business in hand, which the 
 sudden introduction of Castaldo had for a minute inter- 
 rupted, was now resumed, by some one of the conspira- 
 tors without, breaking forth in a loud voice. 
 
 u The assassin hath found entrance into the home of 
 majesty, — he lurks in an apartment of the regal palace! 
 Let us enter, that we may drag forth the villain, into 
 day-light." 
 
 " How know you thus much?" demanded the queen ; 
 lt only prove your assertion, and I am ready to surrender 
 the criminal, you are in search of; but be it at your own

 peril, for remember, that as yet he hath undergone no 
 trial, and it is fit, his punishment be left to the tribunals 
 of his country." 
 
 This representation, which was made by the astute 
 queen, to save appearances, might as soon have stilled 
 a raging- sea, as have abated, one iota, the exasperation 
 of the populace. The confusion increased with every 
 moment; a thousand voices exclaimed, — "that a secret 
 passage led thither from the old porchway, by which the 
 inhuman assassin had obtained admittance into the pa- 
 lace, and they insisted on his being given up to their 
 fury." 
 
 " Ha! is it so?" cried the queen; "well," she pro- 
 ceeded, addressing the concourse, in the manner of one 
 compelled to yield to overwhelming force, " it would be 
 useless, I see, my offering any further obstacle to your 
 wish, my friends; so you have permission, some of you, 
 to explore the palace." Then turning to Ferraro, she 
 spake in his ear, a deep emphatic whisper. 
 
 " Marc Antoine," she said, " the man that stabbed 
 your father, is now conferring with Czerina, in her bed- 
 chamber, and urging her to . Right, my friend, be 
 
 sudden as desires." 
 
 " Blood shall have blood!" shouted Ferraro, bursting 
 from her, with the voice and gesture of an exterminating 
 angel, and the next instant, he darted like lightning up the 
 flight of stairs, leading from the hall, to the higher suite of 
 apartments, A select body of the insurgents, with drawn 
 rapiers, and looks of fury, followed : Isabella folded her 
 robe closer about her as they passed ; she bit her lip, till 
 the blood gushed forth, — she knew not of it; — she clenched 
 her hands, till the long nails pierced the flesh,— she heeded 
 it not. Her eyes sparkled fiercely, and demoniacally in 
 the very restlessness of joy, — in the exultancy, the frui- 
 tion of long-harboured hopes. With unequal, but firm 
 tread, she was crossing the hall, towards the staircase, 
 when her attention, which had for more than a minute

 been respectfully solicited, was at length attracted by 
 the obeisance of one of her officers, who seemed to de- 
 sire to address her. 
 
 " Not now, — not now, — I cannot now," she hastily 
 observed, and would have moved away. 
 
 " The baron bid me say, he must speak with your 
 highness instantly," rejoined the officer. 
 
 " Must, sir, — presently will do. Whom, said you V* 
 
 " The Baron Bathori." 
 
 " Umph ! — hah!" said Isabella; " Well, I cannot be 
 disturbed now." 
 
 " He affirms," rejoined the officer; " that he witnessed 
 the perpetration of the fatal deed, from the window of his 
 prison. The person they seek is not the real assassin." 
 
 " Hush, hush, sir ! — No more of that, as you value my 
 favour. Nay, an' that monk be not the murderer," she 
 added, in observing the surprise of the man ; " we all of 
 us know, he well merits death on many another score, — 
 so let not this go further." 
 
 " The baron says, that Piadena — ," rejoined the officer. 
 
 " I know it, sir; I know, what you would say," inter- 
 rupted the royal interlocutor in her turn ; " and have I 
 not that man under ward? ha, sir?" and Isabella pointed 
 significantly to the door of the chamber, where she had 
 caused Castaldoto be confined. " Enough, — go, silence 
 the baron, and tell him I will attend to hear what he has 
 to offer, within these five minutes, — that will be, I hope," 
 she added, in a low inward tone, as the officer withdrew, 
 — " that will be, after he has struck home ! They are 
 i'the toil! — Swell, heart! — it is accomplishing /" and 
 Isabella, anticipating the triumph of requited wrong, — 
 her every feature expressing the uncontrollable exulta- 
 tion, that heralded the fruition of long-desired re- 
 venge, followed in the wake of the conspirators. 
 
 In the meanwhile, all the horrors of unrestrained 
 sack and pillage, were enacting through the interior 
 of the palace. Exasperated at not having discovered,

 so soon as they expected, the object of their wrath, 
 the mob, " in their own inimitable way,"* took ven- 
 geance on the senseless building. They burst into 
 apartment after apartment, — and wrecked their dis- 
 appointment indiscriminately, upon all they met with. 
 Every sort of waste and devastation was committed by 
 these insurgents, who proceeded to demolish whatever 
 they could not readily remove. The tapestry, forthwith, 
 was battered and destroyed, — the windows were dashed 
 out ; costly furniture shattered to pieces ; chests and 
 cabinets broken open, and their contents, either em- 
 bezzled or scattered about. In their abhorrence of the 
 crime, they sought to avenge, they forgot all observance 
 due to the august inhabitress. At length, when, despite 
 their deeds of demolition, their rigorous search appeared 
 likely to have an unsuccessful issue, many of the more 
 active of the tumultuous assemblage, began to meditate 
 on surer and swifter methods, of destruction. Several 
 voices were heard instigating the rioters to resort to fire, 
 as a means, equally desperate and certain, of forcing the 
 inhuman object of their resentment out of his hiding 
 place. A dreadful shout of applause testified the con- 
 currence of the mob. Torches were applied to the hang- 
 ings, — bonfires were raised in more than one of the apart- 
 ments ; and the flames were fed with furniture, or what- 
 ever else the incendiaries could lay their hands upon. 
 
 The consequences were not long in manifesting them- 
 selves. The conflagration spread with awful rapidity 
 from room to room, and roared and crackled among 
 the heaps of nourishment every where afforded, by the 
 pictures, arras, and ornamented wood-work. Part 
 of the roof presently gave way, toppling on the head 
 of many a devoted victim, with the noise of thunder. 
 The yells arising from time to time, proclaimed, from 
 amid the smoke and flames, in which the building was

 enveloped, the multitude, who were actors in this scene 
 of desolation and horror. 
 
 Two persons remained for more than a minute, in a 
 chamber of the palace, as if insensible of the ruin, with 
 which they were encompassed; and the shocking death 
 which momentarily threatened, unless they took some 
 measures to ascertain their rescue. This chamber was 
 the sleeping apartment of the Lady Czerina; and the two 
 occupants of it, at the moment we have mentioned, were 
 Isabella and Ferraro. The broad displeasant light, that, 
 in unholy and imperfect union with the sunshine, illu- 
 minated the room, shed a wild and frantic colouring on 
 the expression of their faces, as the queen and her 
 wretched victim stood in fixed silence looking on one 
 another, not in the bereavement of fear, — but like baffled 
 tigers, whose prey, after having hunted it down, hath 
 suddenly slipped, they know not how, through their 
 savage fangs. Thus, glared they on all around, and on 
 each other. When Ferraro, by the aid of the insurgents, 
 had forced the obstacles of lock and bolt, and rushed 
 madly through the ante-room into the bed-chamber of our 
 heroine, to immolate the murderer of his father ; — how 
 was he struck aghast, to find both rooms unoccupied ? 
 His confederates immediately retired, and went forward 
 to commence their work of uncalculating havoc, but he 
 stood like one, in a state of stupefaction, nailed to the 
 middle of the apartment. He looked about, — on that 
 couch was wont to repose his beloved ! he moved towards 
 it, — his heart was rapidly softening. Some human feel- 
 ings began to steal insensibly over the ground-swell of 
 his soul, like oil, to allay the agitation of the waters. 
 The daemon which possessed him, seemed silenced, if not 
 cast out, when, at the moment, his evil genius again pre- 
 sented itself, in the person of Isabella. 
 
 Suddenly she came behind him, and, grasping his 
 arm firmly in her hand, she whispered in his ear, in a

 deep hollow, but impatient tone, " What gaze you at 
 on that coverlet ? — have you done the deed ?" 
 
 Ferraro informed her of Martinuzzi's absence. 
 
 Isabella gnashed her teeth, and her knit brow black- 
 ened to the hues of disappointed vengeance. 
 
 Both were silent. 
 
 " Is she in bed, that there you fix your eyes so ear- 
 nestly ?" demanded the queen, at length, in a scoffing 
 tone, rendered doubly bitter from the transports of in- 
 ternal rage, the exhibition of which, policy yet obliged 
 her to suppress. 
 
 Ferraro shuddered and stept backward. " Mother of 
 Jesus ! where is Czerina ?" he exclaimed, stung by the 
 last words of Isabella, to a state of mental emotion that 
 was terrible. 
 
 " Now, beshrew thy standing there, so like a statue ! 
 I thought her youngling delicacies had been all laid out 
 before thee ; but, if she be not in bed, perchance she's 
 with your father ; or, say she breathes this life, it is to 
 perfume some dungeon air, till she consent to wed as 
 the tyrant prescribes ; — 'tis evident he has been here, 
 and borne away the struggling girl to ■ " 
 
 At this moment, part of the floor fell with a loud 
 crash, and a volume of smoke and flame from the yawn- 
 ing aperture rose thickly up. Ferraro, in the agony of 
 his troubled soul, rushed from the spot, and sought, 
 through the smouldering ruin, and amid fire, dust, and 
 glowing embers, at the imminent risk of life, the two 
 beings nearest his heart, one of whom was as much the 
 object of his hatred, as the other, of his love. Isabella 
 followed, but, owing to the abstraction of her thoughts, 
 and the progress of the flames, she was in danger, every 
 instant, of being crushed beneath the weight of the 
 blazing beams and rafters, that were falling fast around.

 hearty demonstrations of joy, at beholding her in safety. 
 She was now informed of several important events, which 
 the last half-hour had seen accomplished. 
 
 Those tumults, which, in the beginning, were no more 
 than a mere ebullition of popular wrath against Father 
 Dominick, at length threatened the subversion of the go- 
 vernment. The misguided populace, for the most part 
 even ignorant of the tendency of their own acts, had been 
 hurried into extremities, and, what was originally riot, by 
 insensible but rapid gradations, expanded into revolution. 
 Every quarter of the city, from its centre to its battle- 
 ments, was, by this time, filled with noise and tumult ; 
 and many of the lower rank took arms, with the hope of 
 advantaging their fortunes, in the general licence and 
 confusion. 
 
 Already had the citadel been forced, the gates of the 
 dungeon of Hermanstadt thrown open, and, as a neces- 
 sary consequence, all state prisoners found themselves 
 at liberty. Among others, who were thus let out of con- 
 finement, were the Counts Maylat and Nadastis, who, as- 
 sociated with Vicchy, Duke of Eissenburg, were hailed 
 on their appearance by a loud cry from the multitude, 
 which conveyed their determination to commit, into the 
 hands of those magnats, the further direction of affairs. 
 These acclamations still rung above the crowds, who 
 now filled the space around the citadel, and the whole 
 adjacent streets, when, by the direction of Vicchy, a 
 herald, planting himself on the broad steps of the castle, 
 proclaimed the Richter Iwan, King of Hungary and 
 Transylvania. 
 
 In the thoughtless extravagance of the populace at 
 the moment, this proceeding, however unexpected, was 
 welcomed with loud demonstrations of joyfulness, and 
 the name of Iwan was hailed with acclamations, as the 
 main hope of the nation. Amid this clamour, unto 
 which the tolling of the alarm-bells gave discordant em- 
 phasis, Vicchy presented himself on the balcony, and,

 in an animated oration, addressed to the various passions 
 of the people, set before their eyes the ambition and 
 unrighteous dominion of Martinuzzi, which they had it 
 now in their power to subvert, by the abolishing of his 
 office, and the election of Iwan to the vacant throne. 
 " He only," concluded the orator, " is fit to sway a 
 sceptre, who can wield a sword. Choose ye for your 
 king the Richter Iwan, whose surname of Vilez has be- 
 come a battle-cry, rousing, like the blast of a trumpet, 
 the courage of his followers, and striking terror into the 
 enemy." 
 
 This allusion to the martial fame of our captive hero 
 would not seem particularly well timed; nevertheless, the 
 discourse was received with a murmur of applause, and 
 loud cries of " Eljen, Eljen, Eljen, a Kerdly /" (Live the 
 King !) rang through the air. 
 
 Emboldened therewith, Vicchy w T as just on the point 
 of explaining to his audience, the nature of the Richter's 
 claims to sovereign authority, when the words died un- 
 spoken on his lips, on learning that, notwithstanding the 
 most diligent search, the Richter Iwan was no where to 
 be found. A convulsive feeling of mingled joy and 
 anxiety choked his utterance. " Can he have been sent 
 to sleep with his fathers ?" murmured Vicchy to him- 
 self; " and is it possible, that even yet the promise of 
 the Boszorkany will be vindicated ?" The agitated noble 
 turned away abruptly, and entered the castle. 
 
 The circulation of the news of Iwan's disappearance 
 struck consternation into the minds of all, who were in 
 the secret of our hero's rights ; and his unaccountable 
 absence, in the very moment when he might have taken 
 full possession of every thing he coveted, promised most 
 effectually to disconcert the projects of the conspirators. 
 
 The lord regent had been sought for with no less di- 
 ligence by his adherents ; but, as in the case of Iwan, the 
 result hitherto proved alike unsuccessful and inexplicable. 
 
 Meanwhile, more than one messenger attempted to

 make his way without the walls, to require the victorious 
 army of Martinuzzi to march upon the city and put down 
 the tumult, but all the barriers had been surprised and 
 seized after a sharp conflict ; and, so strict and vigilant 
 was the guard, the rebels established, that none of these 
 voluntary emissaries could accomplish their errand. The 
 small force, which garrisoned the castle, declined to act 
 on their own responsibility, though there could be little 
 doubt, that, had Martinuzzi shown himself, he might, 
 with their aid, have easily crushed this sudden and ill- 
 digested revolution, and awed the people again into 
 allegiance. 
 
 In this state of confusion, the insurrection being at a 
 full pause, and our hero not being forthcoming to take 
 advantage of the general rise in his favour, it presently 
 occurred to some of the insurgents, who were not in the 
 secret of Iwan's parentage, that the wisest use they could 
 make of their power, would be to enthrone the Lady 
 Czerina, whom they had ever idolized, and commiserated 
 for the state of tutelage in which her tyrannical guardian 
 retained her, in the sovereignty of the country. 
 
 Of the vast number of persons, who were now attempt- 
 ing a change in the government, not one in a hundred 
 had been initiated in the real character of the conspiracy ; 
 so that the moment the propriety of the above course 
 of action was hinted at, the popular opinion was 
 freely expressed in its favour. It spread through all 
 classes, with a rapidity like lightning. The demand for 
 the Lady Czerina was echoed from court-yard, and hall, 
 and battlement, and every one shouted, " Long live the 
 Lady Czerina !" The unanimity of the magistrates and 
 superior class of inhabitants, on this point, was admi- 
 rable ; but even here their hopes were doomed to be dis- 
 appointed. The fearful cry speedily flew through the 
 multitude, and passed into all quarters of the city, 
 that her highness was no where to be heard of; and 
 soon the probability, of the royal maiden having pe-

 rished under the ruins of the palace, suggested itself to 
 the busy apprehensions of the populace. 
 
 Men now began anxiously to meditate, or to ask of each 
 other, by what procedure they could, most readily, legal- 
 ize their excesses, and throw the veil of regular form, 
 over the intemperance of their sedition ? But even while 
 they paused for a reply, the course of events was urging 
 on a dread solution. We allude to that catastrophe 
 of our tale, which history hath since handed down, from 
 generation to generation, with a faltering pen, and which, 
 since it brings our narrative to the period, which we have 
 fixed upon for its boundary, requires of us, that we 
 should enter upon a fresh, if not a concluding ma- 
 nuscript.

 When her handmaidens came into the royal bed-cham- 
 ber, some time on the morning of the day, to which the 
 currency of our story hath (with whatever tedium to the 
 patient reader), at length, conducted us, they were dis- 
 mayed to perceive the Lady Czerina, lying senseless 
 upon the floor. Having gently lifted her upon the 
 couch, it was with some difficulty, they were able to 
 recall her intellectual life, and re-animate the vital spark, 
 in a frame so marbly and attenuated, that their very en- 
 deavours seemed like contesting, with the king of terrors, 
 the regal prey he had appropriated, and on which he 
 had already set his seal. By the aid of restoratives, 
 however, accompanied with skill, and gentle tendance, 
 they were, at last, in some measure, successful ; but still 
 the faculties of our heroine appeared unsettled, and the 
 slender thread, upon which her renovated existence evi- 
 dently hung, seemed too finely drawn out to last long. 
 Having feebly intimated her wish, that her attendants 
 should withdraw into an adjoining room, they were in- 
 duced to leave her to the healing dews of slumber. The

 royal maid endeavoured, forthwith to compose herself 
 to rest, and her agitated mood insensibly subsided into 
 a dream-like trance. 
 
 By a natural association of thought, or perhaps from a 
 faint remembrance of what occasioned the syncope, out of 
 which she had just emerged, her reverie, presently, came 
 to hinge on that portentous incident of a childhood, 
 which, like the tree of Java, had thrown a pestilential 
 umbrage on all the succeeding years of life. She con- 
 ceived that she was, already, become as one of the 
 blessed, and was exalted to a place in highest heaven, 
 between Father Dominick and the unknown female, who, 
 on one memorable occasion, had lavished on her all those 
 caresses and endearing terms, proper from a mother to 
 a beloved daughter. The next instant, she believed her- 
 self again lost, and wandering amid those dreary, sub- 
 terranean cells and passages, that branched in all direc- 
 tions, beneath the site of Hermanstadt ;* and then she 
 fancied herself seated, once more, beside that strange 
 lady, on a settee of crimson velvet, in a chamber hung 
 round with arras, of the same costly material ; and the 
 painful impression came over her, with all its original 
 acuteness, that her unknown companion was not in the 
 possession of her right understanding. Much she talked 
 of disputed claims, and crowns, and legal rights, and, at 
 one time, the lady produced a roll of paper before Czerina, 
 and said, " Alas, the day ! my sweetest child, thy father 
 is gone mad, and out of the very excess of his inexorable 
 and insane violence, which he calls his duty to his coun- 
 try, would destroy thee, and himself, and me and all ; 
 but trust a mother's vigilance, to contravene his cun- 
 ning ; look ye, love, how, from the secret cabinet of your 
 hard-hearted parent, I have abstracted these murderous 
 writings, and thus I consign, to everlasting oblivion, 
 the unnatural testimony that would undo us."

 Saying these words, she approached the fire-place, 
 with the view of casting the papers into the flames, when 
 her purpose was arrested, by the sudden griping of her 
 wrist, and, on looking round, she started, and our he- 
 roine faintly screamed in sympathy ; for, unperceived by 
 either, the reverend father had glided into the room, 
 most opportunely, to prevent the fatal perpetration. He 
 and the female, for some seconds, contested the pos- 
 session of the papers, and, during the struggle, the cowl 
 of the confessor fell from his face, which, to the inex- 
 pressible amazement of Czerina, disclosed the features 
 of Cardinal Martinuzzi. At that instant the arras was 
 pushed aside, and a gigantic wolf-dog stalked forward 
 unannounced. The lady beheld, shrieked in sudden 
 fear, and went off into convulsions. While Martinuzzi's 
 whole attention was directed to bringing her about, the 
 roll of papers, which was the object of their late con- 
 tention, slipped, disregarded, to the floor. Nearly at 
 the same moment, unperceived of all but Czerina, the 
 sagacious animal snapped it up, and ran ofT with his 
 prize. By whatever motive impelled, our heroine 
 promptly followed in pursuit. She tracked the footsteps 
 of the brute through many devious passages, until she 
 found herself in the same gloomy and subterranean 
 vault, where, it will be remembered, the sentry of the 
 precipice came, to overhear the colloquy, between the 
 monk and the gipsy Unna. It was lighted up. Here, 
 as the dog paused, the child approached him from be- 
 hind, but failed in resolution, when she would have taken 
 hold of the ravished roll, the recovery of which had been 
 her sole inducement for instituting a pursuit. And now 
 gruff voices, which sounded a short way off, startled her 
 childish apprehension, 
 
 " Hark ye, Wurmser," cried one, " where's the dog ?" 
 
 " Here, Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!'' called several voices. 
 
 The animal let go his prize, and hurried off, in obedi- 
 ence to the well-known signal.

 Czerina, after a minute's hesitation, possessed herself 
 of the roll of paper, but having done so, held it for 
 awhile irresolute. 
 
 All these successive circumstances did our heroine re- 
 enact, in her troubled sleep, and again, as formerly, 
 she paused, doubtful in what manner she had best 
 dispose of the recovered writings. At length, after a 
 short period given to reflection, her resolution forced its 
 way spontaneously to her tongue, and she audibly soli- 
 loquised. '-'Yes," she said, " / will secure the packet 
 from the cardinal, in yon receptacle." 
 
 Agreeably to this object, she thought she moved a few 
 paces, when the form of her guardian uprose from the 
 very frame- work she was approaching, and, at the pro- 
 digy, her soul seemed to die away within her. The 
 vision became every moment more painfully distinct, 
 but even in that instant, in which she stood oppressed 
 with its vividness, an energetic voice rung on her ears. 
 
 " Ha ! — where ? — explain, — / charge you child ! in the 
 nameo f 'mysterious Providence, answer me!" 
 
 The bonds of Czerina's unnatural trance were thus 
 abruptly broken — her long silken lashes separated, and 
 as she opened her cerulean orbs, the pure confidence of 
 childhood, with all its vernal developments of feeling, 
 vanished from her bosom, like the unsubstantial pageant 
 of Astrsea from this rank earth. But her mental facul- 
 ties seemed given to irremediable confusion, on perceiv- 
 ing, that she was, in very earnest, seated in the crimson- 
 arrassed chamber of her dream. 
 
 Martinuzzi himself was standing over her — " Speak !" 
 he repeated, in a voice of uncontrollable eagerness, 
 " and tell me — in the name of mysterious heaven — tell 
 me ! dearest child, where was't you hid the packet ?" 
 
 Czerina made no reply, but gazed with a bewildered, 
 and inquisitive expression on her guardian's face, and on 
 all around. It was an awful, a sublime moment. The 
 fine and indivisible line, which insulates the shadowy

 pathless desert of sleep was overleaped, and an impulsive 
 gleam from its dim horizon, seemed gifted with a power 
 to illustrate the substantial realities of life. The slumber 
 of the body is the enfranchisement of the soul, from the 
 ligation of sense ; and the influxes of our waking and 
 dreaming thoughts, may be said to alternate on our con- 
 sciousness, as the Rhone and the lake of Leman roll and 
 toss themselves within the same bed, without being con- 
 founded, or commingling their waters. But for once the 
 flood of sleep, suspended in its course, swayed in corres- 
 pondence with the stormy undulations, which encom- 
 passed its silent flowing volume, or rather, as was proved 
 by the event, the apparent phenomenon attendant on 
 Czerina's awaking, might be compared to the confluence 
 of those rivers at Ballyarthur,* whose troubled waves 
 descend from their separate solitudes, to find repose in 
 the deep sea together — 
 
 "The blended waters are no more distinguished, 
 But roll unto the sea one common flood." 
 
 " Holy Mary !" murmured Czerina, still imperfectly 
 awake, " Methought I passed away, as they say turtles 
 do, in a vision — but 'tis all a mockery, — or how came your 
 eminence with me ?" she continued, in a slow low voice, 
 after a long, painful, and ineffectual effort to reconcile 
 the pertinence of her reverend companion's questions, 
 with a strong impression of her having just awakened 
 out of a dream. 
 
 Martinuzzi silently contemplated for more than a 
 minute, her wan and dilated orbs, and his eyes ran over 
 those traces of perturbation, so conspicuous in her coun- 
 tenance : as he gazed, his impatient temper subsided into 
 a melancholy calm; and then, instead of entering upon 
 the subject, he evidently had so much at heart, he replied 
 to the broken interrogatory of our heroine, by informing 
 
 * The Augrim and the Avoca. — This second meeting of the waters in 
 co. Wicklow, takes place at a very short distance from the sea.

 her, in cautious and soothing syllables, of his having in- 
 troduced himself into her chamber, as was sometimes his 
 wont, by the secret access of a sliding panel, and men- 
 tioned that he had found her wrapped in a deep slumber. 
 He concluded, by slightly alluding to the royal edifice 
 being in flames, to account for his having conveyed her 
 from thence, for safety to her present asylum. 
 
 The gentle girl drooped her languid head during this 
 explanation, and seemed passively to take in the sense of 
 her guardian's words. She offered no remark, but, re- 
 signing her soul to life's final impulses, sat breathing 
 there, as fair a piece of earth, as ever the approach of 
 death came unto with the beauty of the steps, which, upon 
 the mountain top, are the messengers of glad tidings. 
 She hovered between life and immortality, like some 
 embodied exhalation of the morning mist, whose phantom 
 outline stands on tiptoe for awhile, waiting to be robed 
 in the gold and crimson of eternal day. 
 
 Oh ! there is nothing so obstinately blind as the affec- 
 tions, and though an instinctive pang shot, like an ice- 
 bolt, through his heart, Martinuzzi refused to read the 
 meaning of those death- like symbols, which, if he had 
 witnessed in any other than in Czerina, he would have 
 comprehended at a single glance. Presently, in a sub- 
 dued, but still earnest tone, he repeated the inquiry, 
 which had roused her from her vision. — " Daughter," he 
 said, " endeavour to collect yourself, and tell me where 
 you hid the roll of writing, to which you audibly alluded 
 in your sleep ?" 
 
 To these words, Czerina made no answer ; they drop- 
 ped upon the maiden's ear, and the sense was transmitted 
 to her vacant brain, but touched no apprehensive chord — 
 her wan eyes gazed inexpressive, into the face of the 
 speaker, and then her head drooped upon her bosom. 
 
 The vacancy of that look pierced her parent with a 
 double pang, and he paused, ere taking her hand in his, 
 jind drawing her closer to him, he again mildly addressed

 her ; " Czerina, my child," he began, " until now have 
 I abstained from all mention of that mystery, which must 
 be here, and within this hour, at whatever risk, elucidated. 
 Look around thee, love, and view with observant eye, the 
 tapestry of this chamber ; — call to mind, how and what 
 time, your limbs last pressed those cushions, on which 
 you now recline ; — there, there, lean on my arm — cling 
 like the ivy to its parent stem, when the north wind rages. 
 Be not alarmed — the bolt that searches, chastens, and if 
 seared, we are not all sapless; nor ever shall my state, 
 though stripped, and by the cutting blasts of perfidy 
 assailed, fail thee for a staff; look up, nor shrink thus in 
 my arms ; no harm shall reach thee — none, by the deep 
 expiation now ebbing at my heart ! — none. Be composed." 
 
 During this address, Czerina had risen from her seat, 
 and having cast wild and inquisitive regards on the few, 
 but magnificent accommodations of the chamber, she 
 coiled herself under the arm of her guardian, in manifest 
 affright. 
 
 Martinuzzi, for an instant, remained almost irresolute, 
 but the stake that hinged upon that moment was too 
 mighty to allow of his receding. — " Daughter," he shortly 
 resumed, with uncontrollable earnestness and emotion, 
 "on the issue of this hour rests more than thou imaginest. 
 Oh, pardon me, then, if I seem harsh, since with whatever 
 pain I must enforce an answer. Look around I say — nay, 
 start not, — where was thy sad soul e'en now, when my 
 demand did visit thee like life, and stay thy ebbing spirit ? 
 Speak, I must know thy dream." 
 
 " Ask me not," wildly responded Czerina, " When T, 
 of late, but close my eyes, my soul hath strange capacity 
 of horror. Then, the real, deep, awful, the eternal sleep 
 is over me, and I, an empty shade, will wander all alone, 
 and all in darkness, carrying my own sad bier; fleeing 
 amid the monuments below, or peering into crypts, whose 
 blindness doth the light sepulchral not illuminate, and 
 where things abound, more horrible by far, than worms

 and darkness. Wailings, and stifled shrieks inhabit there, 
 and disembodied crimes, and shapes in glimmering white- 
 ness. I felt erewhiles like some such phantom — yet, not 
 so. Methought, sir, I was a buried thing, alive, seeking 
 through charnels for some unguessed spot, hewn out of 
 marble, where to lodge my griefs in, and where, in icy 
 loathsomeness, the virtuous eye might lose its credit, and 
 the wise tongue grow mute." She spoke with a voice of 
 inward shuddering, and when she had done, she turned 
 away from Martinuzzi — her hands dropped listless by her 
 side, and her glazed orbs became fixed on the opposite 
 tapestry. 
 
 Again Martinuzzi almost faltered in his purpose. — 
 While he yet hesitated, a slight rap sounded against 
 the chamber-door. It slowly unclosed, and Baron Ba- 
 thori stood in the threshold. 
 
 " My lord cardinal," he said, " I again implore of you 
 to allow me to put down this tumult. The boisterous 
 rabble, gathered in multitudes, are now at fault, for it 
 seems the Richter Iwan, whom they meant to exalt to the 
 bad eminence of their leader, is not to be found in any 
 of the prisons of Hermanstadt. I would undertake, even 
 with what troops are in the citadel, to re-establish order 
 in half an hour." 
 
 " No, Baron, not so," replied Martinuzzi, in a com- 
 posed voice ; " there may be no need ; but do you join 
 me twenty minutes hence, within the cathedral, — 1 will 
 then unfold myself further." 
 
 Bathori withdrew. — The clamours of the multitude, 
 which for some time had subsided to a low murmur, now 
 shook the air with greater violence than ever. Even in 
 their remote retreat, Martinuzzi and his fair companion 
 could distinguish voices calling upon the queen byname. 
 "Czerina! Czerina !" rung on every side. Shout an- 
 swering shout, above, below, on the battlements of the 
 castle, in the streets of the city. They could likewise 
 hear the rude mob besiege the building, battering loudly

 at the walls and avenues ; lighted torches were thrown in 
 at the windows, and once there was one hurled with such 
 prodigious force, as to dash through the casement into 
 the very midst of the chamber, which the regent and our 
 heroine occupied. It fell at the feet of Czerina, and 
 enhanced the terror, and added to the state of trepida- 
 tion, with which she was shaken. In this condition, doubt 
 and confusion pervading all her faculties, she imbibed 
 the idea, that the myrmidons of the regent were waiting 
 without, to cement with her blood the usurpation of her 
 guardian. Few things could be more deplorable at that 
 juncture than such a misconception, and Martinuzzi's 
 agony and dismay may be imagined, on finding unre- 
 sisted terror take possession of our heroine. For a few 
 moments she stood speechless, the victim of ineffable 
 horror; then crouching at his feet in agony — 
 
 " Oh ! that the earth would gape, and gulf me to its 
 centre!" she exclaimed. 
 
 " Dear child, be calm !" interposed Martinuzzi, in an 
 anguished voice. 
 
 " Oh ! that the swift whirlwind would entangle me !" 
 she presently proceeded, without heeding him ; " and 
 life and motion give unto the spot I stand on ! — waft me 
 athwart the wide world, sink me down to night, the ever- 
 lasting night which mortal eye can never penetrate." 
 
 It would be impossible to do justice to the emotions of 
 Martinuzzi, at witnessing the distraction of Czerina. He 
 hung fondly over her, and folding his arms across, to 
 hold her to him, sobbed like a child. 
 
 "What! a tear?" cried Czerina; "without doubt, 
 thou hast had a dream about me, thou art so pitiful. I 
 feel a strange delight while thou dost clasp me ; and I 
 am sure thou wilt not let the unhallowed multitude, the 
 savage herd — oh! thou art too good for that — thou 
 wilt never give me up to bleed to death ; but prithee, 
 take me to thy bosom — shield me !"

 " Czerina, kintsaso /"* said Martinuzzi, in a low, falter- 
 ing tone, " strong fancy wilders thee. Never shall any 
 bloody grasp impede the tide of thy young veins, nor 
 ruthless mortal force purple this tender arm. Be not 
 afeard — am I not near thee? My heart shall be your 
 guard. Why wilt tremble so ? Are not these arms for a 
 protection ?" 
 
 A strange change came over the manner of Czerina ; 
 she grew calm at this moment, and there was a solemn 
 fervour in the tones of her voice, as she made answer — 
 
 "The arms of Death are, sir; and where he reigns, I 
 am told is impregnable. Thither I'm hastening. There's 
 a pomp about him too, passing life's pageantries. Chill 
 comes his breath, his kiss is cold and chaste, and his 
 embrace is indeed strong protection. Kings, cardinals, 
 nor all the earth's authorities, are one half so strong, so 
 safe, so silent." 
 
 Martinuzzi was smitten to the heart : he looked at his 
 daughter — his lip quivered, and every instant the agony 
 of his spirit deepened. His long pent-up feelings broke 
 through all restraint, and he wept bitterly. Then, with 
 a sudden impulse, he threw himself at the feet of Czerina, 
 and implored her, in the most pathetic terms, to endea- 
 vour to compose her feelings. Although it was a sight to 
 melt a heart of stone, to see this mighty dignitary hum- 
 bling himself before his own unacknowledged child, 
 there was nothing wonderful in the spectacle. What are 
 the vain pride, the glory — what the circumstance of this 
 world, when put in competition with the least affection 
 of the heart? And if weighed against the dictates of a 
 parent's feeling, it is the balance of tinsel against bul- 
 lion. 
 
 A strange hallucination laid strong hold of our heroine's 
 mind, on witnessing the grief of Martinuzzi, as he knelt 
 before her, and in such urgent terms entreated her. She

 conceived, that she was at length invested with her regal 
 power and havings, and that the regent was petitioning 
 for pardon, on account of the high hand, with which he 
 had carried his authority, during her non-age. Impressed 
 with this idea, she broke with an air of majesty from the 
 hold of Martinuzzi, and after walking to and fro in the 
 apartment for the space of a minute, stopped opposite to 
 the imaginary criminal, who remained prostrate, with his 
 face locked in his hands, and his forehead buried in the 
 crimson cushions of the settee. 
 
 " Rest you there, now, my lord cardinal," she said, in 
 a tone of supreme haughtiness ; " that posture best be- 
 fits the man, so lately seated on my throne above me : 
 so — 'tis well. Now hearken to the high misdemeanours 
 with which thou art charged withal, and, if thou canst, 
 acquit yourself. Trust us, sir, however, we despair 
 thereof; we wish you a happy issue out of this danger — 
 'twill much content us. God's mercy ! gentleman, we 
 never knew what vengeance meant, but justice must not 
 be persuaded ; and to compromit the safety of high of- 
 fenders, like yourself, were but to tempt the insolence of 
 men of lesser note. Lord Cardinal Martinuzzi, erewhiles 
 regent of this realm, give ear to our arraignment !" 
 
 " Hold my heart-strings!" internally ejaculated Mar- 
 tinuzzi. 
 
 " Nay," proceeded Czerina, " be confident and boldly 
 plead ; nor, at the worst, doubt but that we shall temper

 assume some dreadful form, to charge thy guilt, and 
 scare thee with avenging looks from thy usurped estate. 
 Nor is this all: — Presuming, it may be, on our years 
 and sex, thou didst oppose thy usurped greatness to our 
 proper welfare, to our dearest peace, and, with the hand 
 of arbitrary rule, didst overbear our reason — saucily 
 control our sphere of action — thereby frighting our very 
 soul, startling the life-blood from our heart, making us.. . 
 Raise thee up, impious man, and, if thou darest, look 
 what thy godless wrong hath made me — the wreck, the 
 shadow of my former self. Christ save me ! but since 
 the accursed hour I first descried thy visage, lurking 
 beneath the robe of Father Dominick — even on that 
 ground where now thou kneel'st and groan'st, have I 
 never shaken hands with death's twin sister, peace. Ay, 
 grovel — hide thee in the centre, from every living eye. 
 Thou hadst best, for as thou hast doomed me to a smile- 
 less and abortive life, so surely, unless thou showest good 
 argument, shall justice wreathe fetters about thy limbs, 
 which, like a snake, (I do but use the terms with which, 
 with unreverend boldness, thou reviledst thy sovereign,) 
 — which, like a snake enamoured of thy greatness, shall 
 gnaw a passage to thy savage heart, till thy flesh and they 
 become incorporate. Ha ! do you writhe ? 'twere wisest, 
 else, by the holy rood ! thou shalt not live so proud and 
 arrogant. Tempt not a wrath as hot as flames of hell, 
 lest — there is a word, — villain ! that hast cut my virgin 
 heart in twain. Tis my turn now to triumph. Ho ! I 
 am your queen, and I can make thee nothing but a 
 corpse !" 
 
 Czerina ceased, and looked around her, with the pride 
 and bearing of an injured queen ; her eyes were dilated 
 and inflamed, her nostrils were distended, and her lip 
 curved in excess of hauteur. We have said elsewhere, 
 that our heroine's form was chiselled after the most sym- 
 metrical model, but withal, as to size, on somewhat of 
 the Fenella scale, and the writer hath had occasion to

 remark, in the course of his experience with the beau 
 sexe, that the souls of such are, for the most part, of a 
 magnitude, vastly disproportioned to the minuteness of 
 the fragile tenement, wherein they are doomed to be 
 " cabined, cribbed, confined," during their detention 
 from their native sphere. Thus it was with Czerina ; and 
 the magnificence of her passion, excited into full play, 
 can hardly be conceived, without recollecting, that her 
 gentle nature, being overwrought, was fain to make an 
 extra demonstration of mind, to countervail the physical 
 disadvantages, under which she laboured. 
 
 "Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus." * 
 
 Her soul flamed out, as it were, all the more violently, 
 through very indignation, that her bodily structure should 
 be so inadequate, to represent the majesty of her wrath. 
 
 When Czerina bade Martinuzzi raise himself, and look 
 what a wretch she had become, he lifted up his eyes, and 
 riveted them upon her ; and the pang of agony that shot 
 through him at that moment, was almost more than man 
 might bear. When she had done speaking, he reverted 
 his gaze, and murmured several sentences in a broken 
 inarticulate voice ; the almost inaudible sounds were not 
 addressed to his daughter, but were the spontaneous 
 expression of a desolate and contrite heart, that made 
 confession Cvnd sought consolation, where alone that 
 could avail, or this be obtained. The state of feeling 
 which the invective of our distraught heroine evinced, 
 was of too exaggerated a character to subside into calm, 
 and the impulse of her emotions soon prompted her to 
 resume the discourse. 
 
 " Thou wert cognizant," she proceeded, with a look of 
 fixed indignation ; " all along, of the unhappy attach- 
 ment subsisting betwixt me and Marc Antoine Ferraro. 
 It matured under thy auspices. For a while thou smiled'st

 upon our passion, and bade me entertain him as my 
 future husband, but thy gentle seeming, was only in 
 truth, a cruel feint, to sharpen to keener edge, the weapon 
 of tyranny, with which thou hast destroyed me. 'Twas a 
 refinement of malice worthy of thee, to buoy me up with 
 hopes, only to blast them. The edict by which, on thy 
 return from Coloswar, thou precludest Antoine Ferraro 
 approaching our person, was the bolt of death. With 
 such view, I know thou launched'st it, and as such, sir, it 
 must be answered. We grant thy services to our state, 
 and have ourselves taken warm interest in the opinion of 
 thy glory. Yet, since the seat of your high soul is fired 
 by lust of usurpation, all your bright shows, sir, tend to 
 smoke and sparkle, and like the palace of our fathers at 
 this fated hour, glitter but unto ruin. Again, I demand, 
 what excuse hast thou for restricting thy sovereign in 
 that particular, wherein the meanest peasant girl in her 
 dominions is free to use her discretion? Speak forth, — 
 we wait your reply." 
 
 The position of Martinuzzi grew every moment more 
 painful and difficult ; he had intended to have come to 
 an explanation with his daughter, but her exalted mood 
 forbade any immediate attempt at elucidating past mys- 
 teries; yet, the crisis of his and her fortune seemed to 
 demand some such instant and energetic procedure. In 
 this fearful strait, he determined to avail himself of the 
 possession of a peculiar, but by no means uncommon 
 faculty, whose exercise we have had occasion more than 
 once to record, in the preceding pages of our narrative. 
 Whilst our heroine, with stern gaze, awaited the defence 
 of her guardian, a low, solemn, and death-like voice 
 proceeded from the further depths of the apartment, — 
 " Czerina! Czerina !" On hearing so strange and start- 
 ling an invocation, the heart of the royal maid beat thick, 
 and her brow feai fully contracted, as she looked in the 
 direction, from whence the articulate sound, like a voice 
 from the tomb aDpeared to issue ; but no visible anima-

 tion, save that of the regent and herself, was in the 
 chamber. The tone ef Czerina's mind had been already 
 exalted to a pitch bordering on insanity; therefore, from 
 an instinctive and indefinable law of sympathy, the sud- 
 den sounding forth of the mysterious voice did not strike 
 her as being so very wonderful and inexplicable, though 
 in another frame of mind, such a circumstance was cal- 
 culated in no ordinary degree, to excite astonishment. 
 But, by a sort of mental necessity, the morbid condition 
 of feeling, which our heroine owned at the period, must 
 have flowed into, and harmonized with aught, that pre- 
 sented itself to her contemplation, partaking of the same 
 genera] preternatural character. 
 
 Upon this marvellous property of the human mind, 
 Martinuzzi founded his present hopes; and without al- 
 lowing his daughter time to give utterance to the feeling 
 of surprise, not unmixed with horror, that came over her, 
 he demanded, whether she did not remember the tones 
 of that plaintive voice ? Circumstances favoured the de- 
 ception practised on our heroine ; her dream wrought in 
 her still, and the very fact that the last and only time 
 she had been in that apartment, similar accents had vi- 
 brated on her ear, induced her the more readily to im- 
 bibe the notion, which it was Martinuzzi's object to con- 
 vey into her mind. 
 
 " The voice was that of the melancholy inmate of 
 this chamber," replied Czerina, to the inquiry of her 
 guardian. " Oh ! how a dawn of light breaks in upon 
 me ! — Where is that lady ?" 
 
 " In heaven," solemnly answered Martinuzzi. 
 
 " Then 'twas her spirit spoke," rejoined our heroine ; 
 " but list!" And she leant forward, as if to catch every 
 syllable of that invisible sounding forth. 
 
 " Czerina !" repeated the low melancholy voice ; " my 
 poor unhappy child! I'm the same thou nained'st, — 
 give ear unto my words. Thou art not the rightful 
 queen of Hungary, — she is thy maternal parent, who

 now addresses you, and be not wrath with Martinuzzi, 
 for he is thy father." 
 
 What a torrent of feelings rushed through the bosom of 
 Czerina, at this announcement! Not if the skies had 
 opened, and the speaker had shown herself in all the 
 beatitude of heaven, would it have obtained a more ready 
 credence. The mind of our heroine was so prepared by 
 a long train of circumstances, to receive the information, 
 that directly the word was spoken, it pierced into her 
 soul with the strength of inspiration. She doubted not 
 the truth of the declaration, for an instant, but cast 
 herself at the feet of Martinuzzi, exclaiming, — 
 
 " Bless! oh bless thy daughter! I know thou art 
 indeed my sire, — oh ! bless and forgive me, sir, and for 
 awhile shadow and shut me in thy silent soul ; but ere 
 I breathe my spirit away, which will be soon, — I feel, — 
 do thou, Form of air! which art my mother's shade, en- 
 fold thy wings about me! wrap me up in love! and, if 
 thou canst, transport me to thy mysterious source, in the 
 world of spirits, to which I feel I am hasting." 
 
 " Czerina, my child, Christ pardon! Jesus have mercy 
 on thy soul!" resumed the same mournful voice; "thou 
 must endure thy mortal coil, for thy father's sake, 
 whose clue of life is spun along with thine. The allotted 
 charities that soothe the woes of life, are scattered in thy 
 path, — so live, to cultivate thy happiness, by practising 
 pure thoughts and pious deeds. But now, give heed unto 
 what thy father hath just spoken, and acquaint him, 
 where was't thou concealedst those papers, in thy child- 
 hood. Farewell! obey me, and be happy!" 
 
 Never was there a more thorough and sudden revolu- 
 tion of sentiment than that, which the deceptious proce- 
 dure of Martinuzzi, wrought in the breast of Czerina. A 
 tumult of emotions overcame her ; her eyes gushed out 
 unbidden tears, which streamed down her cheeks, and 
 the words she heard falling upon her ears, as the admo- 
 nition of an angel, shook her very soul. Only a few

 minutes gone by, and she towered aloft his judge, accuser, 
 sovereign, — and now, like a meek and repentant child, she 
 wept and trembled before her mitred companion, who 
 raised her from her incumbent posture, and strained her, 
 with fond emotion, to his breast. By no other expedient 
 than that to which he had recourse, considering the state 
 of his daughter's mind at the time, could the information 
 it behoved Martinuzzi to convey, have been so directly 
 imparted, or have operated such important results. 
 More than a minute of deep and awful silence ensued 
 after the voice of the vision died away. At length, in a 
 low insinuating cadence, sympathetic with the breathless 
 feeling of the moment, Martinuzzi again addressed his 
 entreatance to his now obedient daughter. 
 
 "The hour, the occasion, suit not to explain these mys- 
 teries," he said ; u at present, one consideration is all 
 paramount. Thou didst witness, that my late request 
 stirred up thy mother, from the rest of the grave; thou 
 heard'st, how she seconded my prayer. Indeed, you 
 know not how much depends on that roll of writings 
 being forthcoming. Bethink thee, dearest, — where have 
 you concealed a document, big with the honour and ac- 
 quittal of thy father. Oh speak ! give me instant satis- 
 faction herein." 
 
 Czerina looked her father earnestly in the face, for a 
 few moment;; then she half closed her eyes, as if every 
 faculty of her mind was occupied in revolving occur- 
 rences, that flitted across the haze of her distempered 
 brain; she spoke not, — she scarcely breathed. Her heart, 
 with the violent and impotent effort of a young bird against 
 its bars, struggled within her bosom ; and the faint hectic, 
 which more than once during the previous hour, had 
 tinged her cheek's translucent alabaster, seemed finally 
 drawn off and imbibed, by that fluttering pulsation. 
 With dreadful strain on her mental powers, wound up 
 beyond the apparent limits of endurance, Czerina at 
 length essayed to reply to Martinuzzi. She commenced

 speaking, then again paused, gasping for breath; and it 
 was plain, that in the sequence of her gradual recollec- 
 tion, her mind was affected with dread and strange emo- 
 tions. Several seconds passed ere she acquired voice to 
 say :— 
 
 " Oh my dear sire ! the horrible means, which pre- 
 sented itself for the concealment of that roll, is never to 
 be obliterated from my memory. Nathless, it is in vain 
 I would retrace further. I have no clue whereby to tra- 
 verse o'er again the maze of those winding passages. 
 The particulars of that abduction, and the ground 1 trod 
 on, are engraved indelibly here," and she pressed her 
 hand to her heart, " but the rest puzzles my faint remem- 
 brance." 
 
 Martinuzzi hid his face in his hands, and gnawed his 
 livid lips in very bitterness of disappointment. Presently, 
 however, as if all at once made aware, that every chance 
 was not yet extinguished ; he again questioned his daugh- 
 ter in a gentle and inductive tone of voice. 
 
 " Surely, love, you must have removed the roll from 
 this room, — collect yourself, you can have no difficulty, 
 remembering so much of your silly theft?" 
 
 " That I do remember," replied Czerina, speaking 
 slowly and low; " but, alas! memory can only relate, to 
 my dim soul, a confused and broken tale of all else that 
 passed, till, wild and wan, and maddened, I found myself 
 standing in the same fatal spot, where, on the over-night, 
 a stroke was aimed at my life, of the particulars of which, 
 although its reality is sufficiently attested by the scar on 
 my breast, I retain but an indistinct impression." 
 
 Martinuzzi's countenance beamed once more radiant 
 with the light of hope. " What — what say you, sweet?" he 
 suddenly exclaimed with a kind of hysterical utterance, 
 and bending forwards with indescribable eagerness of 
 gesture; "were you now in that vault, where the deed 
 you spake of was committed, would it be in your power,

 MANUSCRIPT XXXII. 305 
 
 do you think, to recover the possession of those papers, 
 you conveyed from hence?" 
 
 " Assuredly, I might in that case, ascertain and p int 
 out where I concealed them," was the reply rendered, 
 after a moment's thought. 
 
 A hysteric affection struggled audibly in the throat and 
 chest of Martinuzzi; it lasted but an instant; and without 
 speaking another word, he inclosed his daughter's hand 
 in his own, and drawing aside the arras, opened a narrow 
 door, through which he mutely signified his wish to 
 conduct her. 
 
 " Whither would you have me accompany you, father?" 
 asked Czerina, hanging back within the threshold, and 
 manifesting no small reluctance to proceed. 
 
 " Be still, and confide in me, dearest; this way, — 
 there! — not a word, — do not flurry yourself, all shall yet 
 go well." 
 
 Thus saying, Martinuzzi quitted the room, drawing 
 the trembling girl after him. They descended several 
 flights of stairs, and then her venerable guide, hardly less 
 agitated, though from a different cause, than she was 
 herself, led, or rather bore her, through the dreary vaults 
 of Hermanstadt. Ardently as ever father's heart beat in 
 aspirations for his child's happiness, did Martinuzzi de- 
 sire that Complacency, the stranger, should revisit the 
 bosom of Czerina ; but now, one master-thought swayed 
 every faculty of his soul, and drank up all the springs of 
 his being; and his stern self-centred absorption, and ap- 
 parent disregard of her tottering steps, and almost ex- 
 animate condition, during their subterranean progress, 
 may serve to indicate, with what exclusive intentness his 
 whole soul anticipated the recovery, he believed at hand. 
 Martinuzzi was provided with a small lanthern, by whose 
 aid they explored their way, through those obscure and 
 devious avenues. At length, on turning a sudden angle 
 at the termination of a long and narrow passage, they

 306 MANUSCRIPTS OF ERDELY. 
 
 arrived at the entrance of a dark and noisome vault. 
 They passed within, and Czerina felt the exhalations of 
 the circumjacent walls, pierce through every pore of her 
 flesh. The place struck her, as being obviously more 
 chill and close, than any other she had yet encountered 
 in those caverned regions. The ground was slippery, as 
 well with accumulated dews, as with the loathsome con- 
 cretions of slime and darkness, that almost covered its 
 clayey surface. In the midst of this dungeon-looking 
 recess, the cardinal made a full pause. He would have 
 dropped the hold which he had of Czerina, but she re- 
 tained his hand within both of hers, with a convulsive 
 pressure. Raising the lamp on high, Martinuzzi shed 
 its light on those dun and earthy exudations, that sad- 
 dened the air, which thus, suffused with a " counterfeit" 
 illumination, became the indistinct medium of vision. 
 The gloomy interior of the vault, grew upon the gaze in 
 slow and horrible detail. All was bare, dripping and 
 desolate, and the solitary spot would have seemed for 
 ever to have been unmolested by the tread of man, but 
 for an object, fabricated by human hands, which pre- 
 sently fell within the range of the flickering light, — even 
 that bore a strange correspondence, with the other re- 
 volting appurtenances of the cell. It ivas a coffin, which 
 rested against a side of the chamber, near the impene- 
 trated gloom of the opposite entrance, and which appear- 
 ed falling to pieces, from the effects of time or accident. 
 
 " Look around you, child," whispered Martinuzzi, in a 
 horridly still-strained tone, that almost burst without the 
 bounds of his forced and preternatural calmness. 
 
 Czerina, with a wild and troublous expression of coun- 
 tenance, traced the course of the unsteady ray, as it suc- 
 cessively pierced the recesses of the vault, but when, at 
 length, the lamp was made to shed its gloomy halo on the 
 delapidated chest, she started back, and her eyes recoiled 
 in inward and uncontrollable affright, — she feebly essayed 
 to indicate with her finger, that decayed receptacle, but

 her nerves, which the courses of her past life, and her 
 late dream, had already striken with wildering terror, 
 became at the moment, absolutely bound up in impotence 
 — she shook in every joint, — her hand trembled, and it 
 was in vain she would have raised her arm, — the limb, 
 unequal to the effort, remained just parted from her side, 
 not listless, but paralyzed. Her anxious companion, how- 
 ever, recognised the scareely developed movement, and 
 with the tact, inseparable from high-wrought feelings, 
 divined what was its object. As the light form of his 
 daughter quivered and sunk from his support, he moved 
 a few paces forward, leaving her reeling, while all objects 
 around seemed to recede before her glazed eyeballs. 
 Long Martinuzzi leant over the broken coffin. At that 
 instant the eyes of our heroine rested on a wild form, 
 such as had often troubled her, like an imposture of the 
 memory, to cheat her nights of rest, but which now ap- 
 peared to rise up on her waking. When from the obscure 
 threshold, that darkly terrible shape emerged into the 
 dim light of the lamp, the closing portent of her last 
 dream was re-enacted. As that dread presentment gra- 
 dually lost the vagueness of outline it at first bore, it 
 seemed to thrill through the marrow in her bones,— her 
 eye-balls were ready to start and crack their sockets, — 
 she gasped for breath, and with semi-voluntary energy, 
 sought to express the extremity of her dismay, but her 
 voice sunk to a low murmur ; and finding she strove in 
 vain, she yielded to the full flood of horror, that hovered 
 upon her soul, — her eyes closed, and her throat choked 
 with emotion ; a sickness stole across her heart — she 
 tottered, and the next instant fell exhausted and insen- 
 sible on the damp ground. 
 
 The soul of Martinuzzi, meanwhile, was too intent upon 
 his quest, for him to be aware of what had happened ; he 
 peered into the hollow of the coffin, where all viperous 
 and speckled tilings seemed to have made their nestling

 place, but of whatever else he expected to find within 
 that cavity, it was vacant. The papers, which from the 
 slight sign of Czerina, he gleaned had been there de- 
 posited, were not visible. Martinuzzi shrunk aghast, and 
 in a tone of bitter disappointment, which his intense 
 emotions bordering on despair, made unconsciously audi- 
 ble, murmured, " Gone ! the testimony, that would have 
 redeemed me, mouldered away ! — my evil destiny then is 
 too strong for me." 
 
 " It might have been, but for a Providence that is sleep- 
 less !" spoke a well-known voice in the ear of Martinuzzi: 
 he raised his head, and directed his eyes mournfully, but 
 composedly, towards the person who thus abruptly made 
 her presence manifest. She was the Gipsy Unna. Her 
 features were haggard, and her eyes bloodshot; but in 
 other respects, the wild expression of her countenance 
 seemed effaced by suffering, and her humble mien ac- 
 corded ill with her usual character, and supernatural 
 pretensions. " You are in search of that roll of writ- 
 ings," she said, after a pause, " which your ill-fated 
 daughter would once have consigned to the decompo- 
 sition, proper to all things, enclosed in such a chest as 
 that?" 
 
 The prelate was silent. 
 
 " Know, I arrived on the spot, just in time to witness 
 the act, and avert the destruction. That manuscript in 
 thy hand-writing, I retain in my possession." 
 
 " Now, God be thanked !" ejaculated Martinuzzi, with 
 deep and pious emotion. 
 
 " Or, at least, I can point out where it is now secured." 
 
 " What spot? Is it far from hence V demanded Mar- 
 tinuzzi, in a breathless voice. 
 
 " It is in a secret recess, within the hallowed dome of 
 St. Theresa," replied Unna, " where I meant it to have 
 remained till the day of doom ; but now, I care not if you 
 have it back again. In any event, my race will never

 reign in Hungary ; for, ha ! look where the young queen 
 lies withered, and lifeless." 
 
 Martinuzzi started, and turned his head. Then he 
 moved to the dark spot, on which his child had fallen, 
 and raising her in his arms, strained her convulsively to 
 his breast. There was a dead pause — how full of pain- 
 ful reflection to both ! " Oh God! Is't come to this? 
 Czerina, my pale and blighted girl, sleep you on the chill 
 earth?" mourned the wretched father, after along silence, 
 in a paroxysm of uncontrollable feeling. " Not there, love, 
 but next my heart, — alas! that's chiller yet! — how hap- 
 pened this? What, still ? It is thy father, sweet ! — how 
 cold thou art ! death is upon thee ; oh, my injured child! 
 But wait, and I'll die too — methinks, it now were best to 
 lay me down for ever in this dungeon, — here by thy side, 
 and fail away together, — why should I halt behind i' the 
 
 world, when thou I loved art . No, thou hast not 
 
 yet wasted away from sight, though, whilst I lock thee in 
 my arms, I feel thee melt from my embrace.* Dear, most 
 dear ! all my delight a leaving me — then where, and what's 
 the world ?" There followed a long and solemn pause, 
 as Martinuzzi closed his lament ; and then abruptly turn- 
 ing to where Unna, much affected, stood attentively re- 
 garding him, he resumed, in a cadence of mingled agony 
 and bitterness, " and this is the work of thy insane ambi- 
 tion , — the issue of thy insensate machinations ; was it a kind 
 deed of thee?" 
 
 " Twas meant for the best," was the reply, ren- 
 dered in a more subdued and humane tone of voice, 
 than had issued from the speaker's lips for years; "and if 
 it be reproach, which I will not deny, thou mightest 
 forgive it." 
 
 " Oh ! pause there," returned Martinuzzi, bitterly. 
 " My sweet child, the thing that lay so near the fibres of 
 my heart, is withering away. Look on her, cruel mother !

 Behold this fading- flower, over whose lovely promise thy 
 fell interference hath hung, like a chill spell, to spoil or 
 ere it blossomed, before its fragrance quite filled all the 
 air that girt this kingdom. Ay, gaze thy fill. Is it not 
 pitiful ?" 
 
 Unna remained silent for an instant, ere she replied — 
 " It is accomplished, son — her fate alone remains to be 
 marked on the page of my dark volume, and then, I ween, 
 the history of the race of Thomas Polgar will soon be 
 closed." 
 
 " Mother," cried Martinuzzi, in reproachful accents, 
 " you rave the while, Czerina is dying." 
 
 " Dying? Thy child dying, do you say? Ha! so she 
 is," Unna answered in alow hollow broken tone, as if her 
 thoughts were wandering. She paused, and then, with a 
 soul-harrowing shriek, that had something in it almost 
 frantic, suddenly burst out — " And where is mine, then ? 
 Mine! my Alaric — my brave and peerless Alaric ! All 
 slurred and bloody, buried deep in the rank mould of the 
 battle field ! Oh God, this marble heart ! — dead ! dead ! 
 dead ; — and I, the unhappy parent of a blighted race, 
 withstand these tempests calmly. I do not shed a tear, 
 and yet in how profound a gulph I'm sunk! Not thought 
 can fathom an abyss more dire of wretchedness. When 
 thou consignest the freckless tint, in which the charm of 
 that maiden's cheek is painted, to become the spoil of 
 every foul and wormy thing, that mars the honoured 
 covert of a monument, — oh ! then remember what I 
 suffer; — think of thy brother's despised resting-place, nor 
 dare, for thy soul's purchase to arraign my acts at the 
 tribunal of thy judgment, nor imagine a harsh thought 
 against thy stricken mother. Thou hast, at least, atone- 
 ment." 
 
 Martinuzzi made no answer; his soul was all in- 
 tent upon his child, — his heart too full of anguish for 
 speech. — After a moment, he turned away, and directed

 his course, with Czerina in his arms, towards the cathedral 
 church. 
 
 Unna remained in momentary forgetful ness, and then, 
 with absorbed air, woe-fraught visage, and feelings and 
 remembrances tugging at her heart strings, which, if we 
 even dared to describe, would defy our analysis, she 
 roused herself to follow, with exequial tread, her eldest 
 born, her justly celebrated, but smitten, broken-hearted 
 son.

 Jn an ancient and desolate apartment, attached to one 
 of the side aisles of the cathedral, paced the stately and 
 military figure of our hero. He was occupied, as may 
 well be believed, in no agreeable meditations ; his power 
 was past; he was the prisoner of his arch-enemy, who 
 would, doubtless, without scruple, consummate his long 
 projected usurpation in the blood of his benefactor's son. 
 The knowledge of his lineage, and the operation of late 
 events, had contributed rather to strengthen, than to

 dissipate the prejudice and enmity to Martinuzzi, which 
 had been so artfully instilled into our hero's mind, in his 
 boyhood. Influenced by the advice and argument of 
 Luke Swartz, he had disguised his superior endowments, 
 beneath the impenetrable cloak of mental imbecility. 
 He trusted, by this means, to avert from himself a si- 
 milar fate to that, which had overtaken the venerable 
 Count Rodna, whose murder was attributed to the orders 
 of the regent. He was led to apprehend, that Mar- 
 tinuzzi, having, in some way not explained to him, done 
 him irreparable injury in infancy, would certainly cause 
 his being put to death before he attained the age of 
 manhood, unless the semblance of foolishness, to which 
 he fashioned his behaviour, should ascertain his safety 
 in contempt. " Contemptuque tutus esse ubi ex indus- 
 tria factus ad imitationem stultitise." 
 
 Sigismund, plunged in painful musing, gave no heed 
 to the insurrectionary uproar, that, for a considerable 
 time, had penetrated even his remote retreat, and his at- 
 tention was only, at length, diverted from his own indig- 
 nant reflections, by the withdrawing of the outward 
 bolt, which secured the low door of his place of durance. 
 On its hinges slowly revolving, Cardinal Martinuzzi was 
 discovered in the act of reverting his head, to address 
 Baron Bathori, who stood a few paces beyond the 
 threshold. 
 
 " You will please place yourself, baron, at the head 
 of what troops are in the castle. March them straight 
 hitherward, and have them drawn up in front of the 
 cathedral gates; — but, hold! perchance the present 
 disorders of the city may infer the possibility of blood- 
 shed ; — I would not for the world incur that danger." 
 
 " The tumult is fast subsiding," replied Bathori; " I 
 will answer with that life, your eminence so nobly rescued 
 from the flames, to conduct a guard hither, without their 
 encountering the slightest let or hindrance, during their 
 passage."

 " You are very good," returned the prelate, with his 
 usual faint and condescending smile ; " see to it, then, 
 my lord, and forthwith despatch the task I have en- 
 joined." Uttering these words, Martinuzzi, with com- 
 posed and holy mien, passed into the chamber, and 
 closed the door after him. 
 
 Sigismund recoiled one or two paces, on first behold- 
 ing the person of his conqueror, and then, with reserved 
 and haughty gesture, drawing himself up to his full height, 
 and, silently bending his eyes upon the prelate, he seemed, 
 by his looks, to demand the motive of his visit. This 
 lasted for a while, but Martinuzzi, remaining in a fixed 
 attitude, and not immediately speaking, our hero first 
 broke the deep, and almost awful silence by observing, 
 with the calm, cold air, of a man deeply convinced of his 
 companion's baseness, yet holding him and his utmost 
 malice in too great scorn, to let them ruffle his constant 
 temper. " I am scarcely ignorant of your purpose in or- 
 dering out the castle guard ; — you will find me, sir, 
 encounter death as becomes the son of my father, 
 though, I confess, I would have more willingly met him 
 on the field of battle." 
 
 " You do, then, know who was your father?" said 
 Martinuzzi, without making a more direct reply. 
 
 " Your sovereign, sir, whilst he lived," returned Si- 
 gismund, haughtily ; — " dost not blush to name him ?" 
 
 " It is necessary, that we at length come to an un- 
 derstanding," said the regent, after a pause ; " the 
 time, and the occasion of our interview, equally demand 
 it ; and you, my lord, will be pleased to bear with me, 
 while I enter on an explanation of the past." 
 
 " I must needs hear what you presume to deliver," re- 
 joined Sigismund, bitterly, at the same time scanning 
 significantly with his eyes, the circumference of his pri- 
 son, — " these walls are not so wide, to leave me an 
 option." 
 
 " You will please to be seated," said Martinuzzi, who,

 in the earnestness of his present purpose, either over- 
 looked, or deigned not to take notice of the disrespectful 
 tone and manner of his youthful interlocutor. 
 
 " Nay," replied Sigismund, sneeringly, " this posture 
 best accords with our present relations ; 'twere un- 
 seemly for a man, who hath outlived fortune, to sit in 
 the presence of his victor." 
 
 " In this, and all things else, be it according to thy 
 will," returned Martinuzzi, with stately and pensive 
 reserve. " Stand then, sir, and hear the complaints of 
 a man, undone by thy subterfuge, and the duplicity 
 with which thou hast conducted thyself, in thy dealings 
 with him." 
 
 Sigismund looked astonished for a moment, but pre- 
 served a contemptuous silence. 
 
 Martinuzzi continued ; " Thou hast inflicted an in- 
 jury upon me, which not all the means and havings of 
 thy greatness can ever redress." 
 
 Sigismund again smiled his incredulity, but did not 
 answer. 
 
 " What are the gifts of princes ?" proceeded the re- 
 gent, with animation, — " wealth, power, and dignity. 
 I have tried and proved their nothingness : still men think 
 much of these baubles ; and thy father, Sigismund, only 
 measured the extent of his bounties, by the capacity of 
 his friendship ; — his nature was godlike, and he shower- 
 ed his trusts upon me, with the liberality of Heaven. But 
 two blessings, sir, were mine, which transcend all other 
 earthly acquisitions, — blessings, with which King John of 
 Zapola could not endow me, because they lie not in the 
 gift of potentates ; the one, sir, was my fair repute and 
 unsullied character in the world's regard, — a possession 
 beyond the purchase of mere wealth and fortune, and 
 such as kings might envy, but never confer. This hap- 
 piness I conquered for myself, how truly and without 
 alloy, 1 need but appeal to the universal voice, not of 
 Hungary, but of Europe. — Nay, sir, I must be heard

 out. — For the other blessing, which I name, I stood in- 
 debted to the King of kings, — it consisted in the feel- 
 ing of parental love, with which I contemplated the 
 health and happiness of one dear child." 
 
 Martinuzzi's tones faltered ; he stopped, but almost 
 instantly, with firmer voice, resumed — 
 
 " Pomp, and power, and high authority, were the 
 largesses of thy royal sire; but the two pillars, on which 
 the edifice of my glory found support, were my con- 
 sciousness of honourable fame, and interest in the Lady 
 Czerina. These, sir, you undermined and shattered to 
 their foundation. You have spoiled the honours your 
 sire built up in me, and crumbled to dust those columns, 
 on which, as in air, the fabric of my prosperity rested. 
 You have beggared me without a fault ; have undone 
 
 DO ' 
 
 your father's work ; and, not only have stripped from 
 my reaching branches the fair leaves of promise, but 
 condemned me henceforth to such a wintry barrenness, 
 that I have nothing left, I can call my own, save rever- 
 ence for myself, and integrity in His sight, unto whom 
 the vanities and affections of earth as vainly appeal, as 
 the waves of a troubled sea lift up to heaven." 
 
 Deep, and solemn, beyond expression, were the tones 
 in which Martinuzzi delivered the foregoing, and, when 
 he ceased, and looked to Sigismund, as if for a reply, 
 his voice still seemed to be speaking. That youth stood, 
 lost, and absorbed in thought, and in an attitude, as if 
 eager to catch more of those organ sounds, which, though 
 he hardly understood their drift, he felt were based on 
 truth as firm, as the pillars of creation. 
 
 A thrilling silence ensued, which it was some minutes 
 ere Sigismund could prevail on himself to break. At 
 length, in an embarrassed manner, and with an expres- 
 sion of countenance, much less assured than what he 
 exhibited on the entrance of the regent, he observed, 
 though still with coldness, " Your eminence must surely 
 err the while, in your statement of our relative position. —

 I, the oppressor ! — no, sir, it is not I, that have beggared 
 thee ; — bethink thyself." 
 
 " What fiend was it, Sigismund, whispered in thy 
 ear," returned the prelate, " to practise on my credu- 
 lity ? But for thy long, and fatal imposition, death 
 might not now prefer a claim, to mar my earthly peace, 
 nor would dishonour set his brand upon the front of 
 Martinuzzi. Why, why didst pretend unto the world, 
 thy reason was unsettled V] 
 
 " That my life might not be drawn to an untimely 
 close, to assure his impunity, who meant to stamp, with 
 the royal seal of Hungary, his daughter's usurping brow," 
 answered Sigismund ; " and, if the policy of the pro- 
 ceeding was not all along self-evident," he continued, 
 after a short pause, " do not my late defeat and present 
 bondage justify, at length, the apprehension that dictated 
 my disguise ?" 
 
 '• Fatal mistrust !" exclaimed Martinuzzi, — " wound 
 up, and incorporate, I perceive, with your young and 
 growing reason, under the malign auspices of Luke 
 Swartz, who presumed to judge of my purposes, by his 
 own bad and ingrateful nature. Your discomfiture this 
 day, sir, involved the destruction of those marauding 
 bands, who are the worst enemies of Hungary ; and that 
 you are here alive, to upbraid the preserver of your fa- 
 ther's kingdom, and the upholder of his sceptre and its 
 independence, you owe to my interposition, who, ere 
 we joined in battle, gave directions, that, at whatever 
 cost, the Richter Iwan was to be brought, unharmed 
 and scathless, into my presence. We are met, sir, and 
 I am thus enabled to make that restitution, to the right- 
 ful heir of Hungary and Transylvania, which, until this 
 day, from the hour of your higjiness's birth, I have had 
 no opportunity of doing. At the threshold of life, with- 
 out any intervention of mine, you were defrauded of your 
 royal birthright. During your early boyhood, important 
 reasons, which I will explain, recommended silence ;

 nor, indeed, was there, at that time, any immediate ne- 
 cessity for my divulging the secret ; then intervened 
 your fatal pretence of an alienated mind, frustrating all 
 my projects, and driving me to persist in maintaining 
 a deception, which has proved the canker-worm of my 
 past life, and the consequence of which will speedily 
 consign me to a dishonoured grave." 
 
 A strong and evident impression was produced upon 
 the eloquent countenance of Sigismund, by the words of 
 Martinuzzi. His bosom heaved, and his features worked 
 almost convulsively. After a moment's pause, with emo- 
 tion that visibly mocked his every effort to control, he 
 repeated the words, " Without any intervention of your 
 lordship ! — How can it be ? Wert thou clear in this,. . 
 so perfect in all else ! so like a god ! I've surely not 
 been under a misconception for so many years — no, no — 
 I'll not believe it. You pretend this now, indeed — it 
 may suit your present purposes ; perhaps your heart 
 may have relented, but you cannot have meant uprightly 
 in my boyhood — it is impossible. Then say, your emi- 
 nence, — " 
 
 He broke off abruptly, for even as he spake, he caught 
 the glorious steadfastness of Martinuzzi's eye, and marked 
 his calm, melancholy, but proud smile. Conviction, like 
 an intuitive inspiration from Heaven, shot into the gazer's 
 soul ; his cheek grew suddenly and startlingly pale, and 
 he burst into tears, as seizing the regent by the hand, the 
 Richter Iwan resumed, with faltering, quivering lip — 
 
 " Oh God ! I must believe your eminence — that look ! 
 — yet, yet say — can you give me any proof you meant me 
 fairly?" 
 
 Martinuzzi extricated his hand, from the unconscious 
 pressure of his companion, and, placing it within his 
 vest, drew from thence a roll of papers. Slowly he un- 
 folded it before the eyes of Sigismund, and raising the 
 document, pointed, with his right hand, to some words,

 inscribed at the bottom of one of the pages. Sigismund 
 started — the effect was electrical. 
 
 "Do you recognise this appellation, sir?" demanded 
 Martinuzzi. " Do you remember your signature ?" 
 
 " Iwan Sigismund" dropped faintly from the lips of 
 our hero. " I do remember the circumstance of my sub- 
 scription — it was that night, when " 
 
 " Sir," interrupted Martinuzzi, in a solemn voice, and 
 with a mien inexpressibly majestical, " if you recollect so 
 much, you no doubt can call to memory the observation, 
 I then made to you, in the presence of that venerable 
 exile, soon to be hurried to his recompence in another 
 world. I then informed you, that these writings were 
 intended to remedy the evil, consequent upon a most base 
 and dark conspiracy ; — to vindicate the conduct of an 
 involuntary accomplice thereof, from much misrepresenta- 
 tion, and rescue his name from eventual obloquy. You 
 demurred to the obscurity of my language, and I pro- 
 mised, when next you cast eyes upon these three signa- 
 tures — James Stuart, Iwan Sigismund, and George Mar- 
 tinuzzi — that that obscurity would be illumined, and 
 you become cognizant of the purport of these papers. It 
 is for that purpose you are here, my lord ; it is for that 
 purpose I have brought them with me ; — but let me add, 
 these writings, which include my last testament, and an 
 apograph of the confession of Swartz's sister, were meant 
 to be consigned to the archives of Coloswar, lest a sud- 
 den death, or other accident, should prevent me, during 
 my life, from performing that justice, I therein, as you 
 will see, meditated. But on the very day, which would 
 have preceded the execution of my contemplated pur- 
 pose, this roll, by some strange agency, was removed out 
 of my keeping, and only within this hour, most provi- 
 dentially, and almost miraculously, have I recovered 
 possession of it. Receive at my hands, noble sir, the 
 instrument, which at once certifies you of your rights, and

 contains the apology of my life. The injury to my un- 
 spotted name, which your pretence of insanity will have 
 been the occasion of, can never be perfectly redressed ; 
 but there is a justice due to yourself, which must, at all 
 risks, be this day seen to. I go hence, to bid the corps- 
 de-garde, I have ordered out, prepare to escort you at 
 your leisure to the citadel, where I will myself present 
 you to the people, and cause the son of my royal patron, 
 John of Zapola, to be proclaimed, in my presence, the 
 king of Hungary and Transylvania.'' 
 
 The roll of papers, whichSigismundhad taken, dropped, 
 from his relaxed hold, upon the floor. He had not read 
 a syllable, but he felt, with a confirmation, as strong and 
 assured, as was his faith in the truths of holy writ, that 
 they contained the justification of the regent. He moved 
 towards him, and would have fallen at his feet. 
 
 " Nay, son of the dearest and truest friend I ever 
 owned," cried Martinuzzi, " kneel not to me; that pos- 
 ture is properly mine, and anon, in the face of day, I 
 will, as becomes my station, be the first of your liege's 
 subjects, who will assume it. As yet, you have only 
 my word for my integrity; read, sire, the papers, and 
 I pray thee in the meanwhile, excuse my retiring to an ad- 
 joining chamber, where a young and guileless maiden 
 momentarily awaiteth the invitation of the destroyer, to 
 that dark sojourn, whither I cannot yet penetrate, however 
 longing to accompany her. I would wish, that she breathe 
 out her last sigh in her father's bosom ; and permit me, sire, 
 for that melancholy purpose, at present to withdraw." 
 
 In uttering these words, Martinuzzi's lip quivered, and 
 his countenance grew paler ; otherwise his manner and 
 voice were calm. Sigismund, struck aghast with sur- 
 prise, could not immediately reply, and while he paused, 
 in doubt and agitation, the regent made a profound obei- 
 sance, and quitted the room.

 During the progress of these volumes, we sometimes 
 contemplated, with peculiar complacency, having to in- 
 troduce, towards the denouement of our tale, the exposi- 
 tion of his future views, and past conduct, made by 
 Martinuzzi, shortly after the demise of King John ; to- 
 gether with those reflections and observations on his 
 peculiar situation, which, on the death of Alicia, and 
 subsequently on divers occasions, he committed to paper. 
 It now seems that we were, so to speak, cheered for- 
 ward on our voluntary way, (as in the journey of life, 
 men " fardels bear," 
 
 11 In prospect of some gilded, baseless goal, 
 
 Whose sun-bright summit mingles with the sky,"*) 
 
 by an anticipated satisfaction, which, on a nearer ap- 
 proach, hath changed its aspect, and which we are 
 fated never to repair. 
 
 We have only left space for a bare epitome of 
 those expository documents, which our hero is about 
 to peruse. Our inadvertence, however, is the less to 
 be regretted, since, were we to give Martinuzzi's rela- 
 tion of these transactions entire, it would be to make 
 a resume of many of the incidents of our story. We 
 shall confine ourselves to extracting from his narra- 
 tive, those few essential passages, which tend to eluci- 
 date the main intricacies of our plot, trusting that all 
 minor difficulties have been, long since, surmounted by 
 the reader's own sagacity.

 me to insert, in my last solemn testament, the important 
 disclosures which follow, lest inscrutable Providence 
 disable me, during my mortal course, from effecting that 
 measure of justice, which it is the earnest desire, and 
 fixed purpose, of my soul, to accomplish, at what time, 
 and after what mode, may seem in my judgment most 
 seasonable and expedient." 
 
 After this preamble, Martinuzzi goes on to acknow- 
 ledge his early secret marriage, with the Princess Bea- 
 trice ; and, adverting to their separation, and their 
 cohabitation, subsequent to his having taken orders, 
 he insists upon the legality of that re-union. He then, 
 after mentioning the nearly simultaneous occurrence 
 of the queen's and the princess's accouchemens, thus 
 proceeds : — 
 
 " It so chanced that, on the eventful day which 
 ushered into the world these royal cousins, affairs of state 
 detained me at Pesth. On my return, a few days after- 
 wards, I was informed that the princess wished me, im- 
 mediately, to go to her. When I reached the bedside, 
 Beatrice threw her arms convulsively round my neck, 
 and deluged me with her tears. Whatever grief her emo- 
 tion caused me, even its excess excited no suspicion ; 
 our child had been born in the interval of my absence, 
 and that child, as was previously determined on, had 
 been consigned to the gipsy Unna, to cause to be con- 
 veyed to the chateau of my friend, Count Rodna, who 
 was already instructed to expect the arrival of the infant 
 stranger. This separation sufficiently accounted for 
 Beatrice's distress, though scarcely for its continuance 
 and intensity. In vain I implored her to be calm, — she 
 would not be consoled. Time rolled on, only marked 
 by the regular vibrations of her sobs, and the loud pul- 
 sation of her heart. My anxiety deepened into alarm, — 
 my alarm was aggravated into distracting fears. I could 
 obtain no explanation, save what was couched in moans,

 MANUSCRIPT XXXIII. 323 
 
 or piteous phrases, such as ■ Forgive me, George ! I have 
 deceived, — destroyed you !' 
 
 " Franticly, but in vain, I begged her to be more ex- 
 plicit. At every entreaty her lamentations were redoubled. 
 Unna entered, and, too soon, the dreadful solution of 
 Beatrice's anguish was afforded me. My child I found 
 had been substituted for the royal heir of Hungary, 
 and the son of King John was already far on the road 
 to the chateau of Count Rodna. I stood, for a con- 
 siderable time, upon hearing this acknowledgment, as one 
 in whose sentient being, the light of mental and physical 
 existence had been suddenly extinguished. Slowly 
 the fatal truth redawned. My life of life, my unble- 
 mished honour, was compromised ; never, probably, to 
 be wholly re-established. I will not, — I cannot dwell 
 
 upon my sufferings . 
 
 " Indignant was my wrath, and I signified my in- 
 tention, immediately on his majesty's return, to lay 
 before him and the states, the whole particulars of their 
 conspiracy. Whereupon, the princess slid from her 
 couch, and conjured me, on her knees, to spare her, 
 
 and the gipsy's life; — their crime was treason, and 
 
 I waited not to hear her to an end, but quitted her in 
 her tears, and her convulsions. 
 
 " The bitterness of my first agony had not subsided, 
 when the fatal intelligence reached Buda of King John's 
 demise. This event, by changing the aspect of affairs, 
 wrought a material alteration in my views and conduct. 
 Whilst armed with the rights and title of regent of Hun- 
 gary, I conceived that it might be in my power, to up- 
 hold the integrity of the kingdom, despite the ambitious 
 views of neighbouring potentates, and so preserve the 
 crown of St. Stephen, for the son of my departed friend ; 
 but there was no other man possessed of the vigilance 
 and spirit of command that the necessities of that time 
 required ; a darkness loured over the whole region, and

 none, save myself, was capable to take the helm at that 
 critical period. Count Pereny was with the invader : 
 even Count Turascus trembled ; he despaired, — 
 
 " Italiam contingere vento ; 
 Nee meminisse viae media Palinurus in unda." 
 
 I clearly foreboded, in the event of my resigning my 
 regal functions, — which, as I held them in the name of 
 the Lady Czerina, and not of Sigismund, I should be 
 necessitated to do, in case I divulged her mother's crime, 
 — that the vessel of the state must be overwhelmed by 
 conflicting interests, and so suffer shipwreck. 
 
 " Thus unhappily circumstanced, after a long struggle 
 with my inward soul, I decided to immolate that keen 
 sense of honour, on which, perhaps, I too much prided 
 myself, on the altar of my country's good. I cannot, — 
 words are too feeble to represent my feelings ; — I cannot 
 pourtray the total revolution which took place in my 
 inward being, from the moment I submitted, voluntarily, 
 to be an accomplice in a treasonous deed. Life, for me, 
 thenceforth, lost all the gloss that lent it all its value. 
 I felt degraded in my own eyes, from very apprehension 
 lest I might hereafter become so, in the estimation of my 
 fellow-men ; and I can only hope, that Sigismund will reap 
 all the benefit of this exenteration of my bosom. Mourn- 
 ful, indeed, will be my lot, if it shall prove that, either 
 for him or Hungary, I have sacrificed myself in vain. 
 ****** 
 " What avails my determination of disclosing this 
 transaction to the diet, as soon as circumstances will 
 admit of it ? — it brings no balm to the wound that 
 rankles in my breast. Men will one day learn I have 
 stooped my character to the enormity of subterfuge. 
 My own flesh and blood stands aloft, on the pillory of a 
 throne ; and I read upon her innocent brow, in cha- 
 racters of fire, the word lie branded ! No, in this life, 
 my heart can never more know peace. I have hardly

 committed an act of sin ; nevertheless the stings of con 
 science penetrate through the fibres of my soul, and 
 every sensible pore weeps tears of blood." 
 
 The instrument goes on to narrate, how for years 
 subsequent to the death of King John, the state of 
 affairs continued such, as to render the publication of 
 the Princess Beatrice's treason, a matter, so teeming with 
 danger, and pregnant with national convulsion, thatMar- 
 tinuzzi feared his making the discovery would be sub- 
 versive of the verv object, his concealment was meant to 
 subserve. Then after noticing the abduction of the prin- 
 cess, mentioning the place where she was to be found, 
 and supplying the requisite evidence, to ascertain and 
 identify the principal party, the regent thus concluded : — 
 " I shall forthwith betake me to the chateau near 
 Coloswar, where Prince Sigismund, the son of the late 
 King John and Isabella, at present resides, and having 
 caused Count Rodna and the prince, to witness this 
 eviction of my innocence, I purpose, after making a 
 transcript, depositing the record among certain other 
 memorials, which, it will be necessary should be read, 
 whenever it shall please Almighty God to call me from 
 my probation ; and finally, since the state of the Prin- 
 cess Beatrice's intellect will defend her from punish- 
 ment, I can only solemnly adjure the states of Tran 
 sylvania, and Prince Sigismund, whose good, next to 
 that of my country, I have consulted in this matter, not 
 to visit the crime of the parent upon the unoffending 
 head of my beloved child. If I shall be judged to have 
 done aught memorable, or worthy of being engraven 
 on the minds of living men, I wish not to have en- 
 sculptured in cold and feeble imagery, my victories 
 and my laws, for posterity to worship at my trophied 
 tomb, but I bequeath the Lady Czerina, as a living 
 escutcheon, to the country I have saved."

 The other memoranda accompanying this document 
 were composed at sundry subsequent periods. One of 
 these, referring to the death of Alicia, and professing the 
 writer's previous ignorance of her attachment, attri- 
 butes the detention of the maiden among the Cyganis, 
 (of which circumstance Martinuzzi was at the time un- 
 aware,) to Unna's apprehension of her betraying to 
 the world, her knowledge of the transposition of the 
 children. Martinuzzi's communication to Alicia, upon 
 which she grounded her belief of his guilt, merely bore 
 reference to her having to deliver his own child to Unna, 
 to be conveyed away to Count Rodna. 
 
 A paper, written on first receiving information from 
 Swartz of Sigismund's insanity, depicts the horror, with 
 which this event overwhelmed Martinuzzi. The delicacy 
 of his position became complicated in the extreme, — he 
 contemplated in a few months disembarrassing himself 
 of the clouds of error and mystery, which, without a fault 
 or error on his part, obstructed and obscured the walk of 
 his soul, when this lamentable accident came to frustrate 
 all his plans. — His child, besides, was now growing up 
 to woman's estate, and his affection forbad his letting 
 her build her nest upon the seat of kings, lest sove- 
 reignty should become her familiar ; so that when he, at 
 length, sought to reduce her to the level of a subject, he 
 should find the accidents of royal state, incorporate with 
 her being. The measure could not, with a prospective 
 eye to the happiness of her future life, be much longer 
 postponed, — and yet, how now could the announcement 
 be made, and to what end ? since according to the laws, 
 the Palatine, or otherwise, that office being unoccupied, 
 the archbishop of Strigonie, (which see Martinuzzi 
 held,) was entitled and authorised to assume the regency. 
 What good purpose could it answer to plunge the 
 country into convulsion, by the promulgation of treason 
 past, and irremediable? Prince Sigismund, under his 
 auspices and the counsels of ministers of his choosing,

 might indeed, have held his way through the storm and 
 dangers of the times ; but, wherefore, should Martinuzzi 
 weaken the basis of his own strength, when there was no 
 other man in the state, capable of upholding the powers 
 of government ? 
 
 It was about this time, after serious cogitation, and 
 much inward misgiving, believing that Sigismund's men- 
 tal alienation rendered him for ever incapable to advan- 
 tage, by the restitution originally contemplated, and 
 seeing no other way to break the fall of Czerina, or to 
 hold together the discordant elements that composed the 
 fabric of the state, that Martinuzzi first conceived the 
 idea, — conformably to the course which he found recom- 
 mended by his favourite philosopher,* under such contin- 
 gency, of taking the sovereignty upon himself, and per- 
 haps of transmitting it to the Lady Czerina, in his right, 
 instead of in that of John of Zapola. The question was not 
 whether he and his daughter should retire into private 
 life : how gladly would Martinuzzi have embraced that 
 alternative, but he could not, after Sigismund's malady 
 intervened, decline the burden of government, without 
 making Transylvania one scene of commotion and blood- 
 shed. The only point, which, owing to the state of 
 parties, and the fortuitous concurrence of jostling cir- 
 cumstances, he had to decide, was by what title he would 
 consent to hold the sceptre. To promulge the treason 
 of the princess, and retain the regency, by right of the 
 see ofStrigonie, would be to undermine the foundation of 
 his authority, and were doubtfully to put off the evil day 
 of anarchy, without any countervailing advantage. He 
 resolved, therefore, to let matters take their course, to 
 seize the earliest favourable occasion, himself to dethrone 
 his daughter, and not to leave it after his death, for an 
 act of duty or of treason, to rougher hands, to hurl her 
 from her greatness, — so that if any light should hereafter

 be thrown upon the dark origin of her sovereignty, she 
 would be already transplanted, by marriage or otherwise, 
 from the invidious and slippery pinnacle of a throne, 
 whither, however humble perchance her domicile, her 
 footing would be sure, and safe, and stable. Such ap- 
 peared Martinuzzi's policy, but days and weeks, and 
 months elapsed, and these, like successive waves, inter- 
 rolled onwards, swallowed up by the gulph of years, and 
 still no opportunity presented itself to him, without 
 hazarding a convulsion, of executing any measure that 
 might infringe upon, or affect the ostensible rights and in- 
 terests of his daughter, — her very popularity thwarted his 
 design, and militated against her ultimate happiness. 
 But while the lapse of time seemed to consolidate his 
 greatness and his power, the authority of the regent, in 
 reality, grew daily more precarious, and as he felt its basis 
 crumble beneath him, his sensibility, which was of the 
 finest temper, and never framed to be subject to such 
 cruel visitations, was continually excruciated in propor- 
 tion, as it grew more exquisite. The scorpion terrors 
 attached to undivulged crimes ever haunted him, and 
 without having committed a single act of wickedness, or 
 scarcely even lapsed into error, he was reaping the bitter 
 penalty of guilt, after a mode of refinement, to which the 
 hardened nature of a real criminal could never be ob- 
 noxious. 
 
 It was not long after the occurrence of Sigismund's 
 malady, that the horrors of Martinuzzi's situation were 
 heightened in consequence of his brother, Ragotzy, who 
 was unconscious of their relationship, and who was 
 then his secretary, purloining the confession of Alicia, 
 and some other papers from the secret drawer of a 
 cabinet. This loss, combined with the unaccountable 
 disappearing from the floor, during Czerina's interview 
 with her mother, of the important document, which we 
 have just abstracted, seemed to enhance the danger of 
 the regent, and multiply the tremendous hazards of his

 MANUSCRIPT XXXIII. 3"29 
 
 position. Although he became not cognizant of the 
 existence of a son of John of Zapola, Ragotzy learned 
 enough, in ascertaining the rottenness of our heroine's 
 title, to embitter the moments of her father, till, as his 
 victim declared to him, in an early manuscript, it would 
 have been a mercy had he cut direct into his heart with a 
 quick steel, so he had perished once, and felt not death 
 dropping for ever from his perjured lips. 
 
 Meanwhile, as circumstances seemed to increase the 
 chances of a discovery, which were it brought about by 
 the interference of others, Martinuzzi felt that hardly any 
 explanation, which he could give, would suffice to retrieve 
 his character, his longing desire, that at least, his daugh- 
 ter should be placed beyond the reach of a single contre- 
 tems daily augmented, but up to the date of the opening 
 of our story, no opportunity had presented itself of accom- 
 plishing his wishes. 
 
 With every year's delay, the difficulty attendant on the 
 coup d'etat he meditated, became greater, and the risk to 
 the peace of mind of Czerina, were he suddenly to dissever 
 her from all those associations and habits of royalty, in 
 which she had been nourished and brought up, grew 
 critically imminent. He would have confessed to her 
 the facts of her involuntary usurpation, and so gently 
 prepared her for the fall from power, which he believed, 
 sooner or later, inevitable, but he was apprehensive, 
 that her pride would disdain to any longer arrogate honors, 
 to which she knew she had no real claim ; and thus 
 his premature revelation would tend to precipitate the 
 universal anarchy he had hitherto warded off. He could 
 only, therefore, break the impending blow, by causing 
 those reports of his design, at no distant period, to make 
 himself king, to reach her ears through so many and 
 various channels, that she could hardly fail to believe 
 they had some foundation ; and, by his stern and in- 
 flexible deportment, during their hours of business or 
 intercourse (wherein sometimes he found it a hardness to

 dissemble), to render the idea of state details and cares, 
 rather irksome than agreeable to the imagination. 
 
 This proceeding, so far as it tamed down any over- 
 weening hopes, of what the future had in store for her, 
 answered the desired end ; but the breath of rumour 
 struck chill upon our heroine, as all the winds of winter 
 had thrown cold upon her heart ; and the presence of 
 her guardian, indescribably stately, solemn, and re- 
 served, came, like a spell of power, to whisper, in me- 
 lancholy accents, his fascinated and unhappy child to 
 marble. His temper, moreover, at every fresh meeting, 
 seemed to grow more unequal ; for his momentary lia- 
 bility to disgrace, from the false motives, which would be 
 sure to be imputed to him, in the event of an exposure, 
 wrought upon his delicate sensibility, and nice sense of 
 honour, even, as we have seen, to the verge of mad- 
 ness. — " Ah ! quelle grande victime se sacrifle au bien 
 public."* 
 
 This state of irritable emotion, and susceptibility 
 to every casual impression, found of late, fresh food 
 in an occurrence, which we cursorily noticed in our 
 earlier manuscripts. Pereny, in the guise of Father 
 Dominick, picked up, on the ramparts of the citadel, 
 a note, which Swartz had dropped, addressed to his 
 pseudo-keeper from the Richter I wan. The graf imme- 
 diately laid it before Martinuzzi, in whose mind, it 
 was what first suggested the possibility, of that man's 
 having betrayed him, — a suspicion, which appeared to 
 receive confirmation, soon after, by his flight. This in- 
 cident completed the turmoil and distraction, in the 
 secret depths of Martinuzzi's soul. He offered a con- 
 siderable reward for the apprehension of the keeper, 
 though it would have been difficult for him to have ex- 
 plained what was his object ; and his marked trepidation 
 upon this subject, and evident desire to seize upon

 Swartz's person, he was at the pains to interpret to Pe- 
 reny and others, by imputing to that man treasonable 
 practices against the state, — an allegation which failed 
 to impose upon Pereny, who surmised what were the 
 real causes of Martinuzzi's unwonted manifestations of 
 anxiety. 
 
 Then followed the obtrusion of the Duke of Eissen- 
 burg ; and the startling discovery of that noble's being 
 in possession of the secret of Alicia's confession, which, 
 as an exparte statement, involved such weighty charges 
 against Martinuzzi's honour. What wonder that his 
 starts of horror, passion, and affright, lest the world 
 should be surreptitiously instructed in regard to those 
 transactions, and so, upon plausible evidence, conceive 
 him capable of guilt of such a die, should have all 
 the sensitive character, and fierce colouring, proper to 
 the paroxysms of the real criminal, similarly circum- 
 stanced ? 
 
 The same observation applies to his last interview with 
 Pereny; and, on that occasion, to such a degree was 
 his mind upset, that it was not until the gentle influ- 
 ence of a communion with Heaven had allayed his spirit 
 to peace, that the thought of the redemption, contained 
 in the fact of Sigismund's not being insane, fell, like a 
 ray of light, upon the dark and troubled waters of his 
 soul. He instantaneously conceived the course of ac- 
 tion, it behoved him to pursue, and, the same night, he 
 achieved his object, with his wonted Nelson-like auda- 
 city. The heir of the kingdom once in his custody, it 
 was his intention to submit for his consideration, a copy of 
 the narrative, which he had lost, containing the evidence 
 of Sigismund's title, together with the several supplements 
 which went to elucidate the motive of his (Martinuzzi's) 
 subsequent conduct. The timely recovery of the missing 
 document, he trusted, would put his innocence of purpose 
 to a proof, which would not admit of the shadow of a 
 doubt, and in this hope he left our hero, to peruse, in

 full, that evidence, of which the foregoing is a brief 
 summary. 
 
 We approach the conclusion of our tale. As Marti- 
 nuzzi, after quitting his prisoner, musingly paced the side 
 aisle of the cathedral, he was suddenly set upon, from 
 behind, by an assassin, who, aiming a blow at him over 
 the shoulder, drove his dagger up to the hilt, into his 
 breast. The regent turned, with the purpose of grap- 
 pling with his assailant, when he beheld a vision, which 
 like that of the gorgon, paralyzed every nerve, and mo- 
 mentarily transfixed him where he stood, to stone. The 
 assassin was about to repeat his mortal stroke, but in 
 the act, he felt his bare right wrist seized, and entwined 
 within the firm clip of taper icy fingers, which sent a 
 chill through all his veins, as they closed upon him ; he 
 strove to wrench his arm from that unyielding gripe, but 
 found the effort at first beyond his strength, — he reverted 
 his gaze, and his startled eye lit upon the attenuated 
 white shape, and outstretched limbs of a being, no longer 
 of this world. The spectacle presented all the appear- 
 ance of vital emotion, after the functions of life were sus- 
 pended by the glacial touch of death ; like some emana- 
 tion of embodied vapour, on a sudden congealed to 
 ice. Thus stood the lovely dust, which was once our 
 heroine, after the spirit had departed. Her lips were 
 apart, and might seem to the deaf to utter sounds ; her 
 glazed eyeballs started from their sockets, — her hair was 
 dishevelled, — every feature in agitation, — every muscle at 
 work. She seemed for a minute to be standing on tiptoe, 
 but her body leant against a pillar, from which her form 
 appeared to emerge, like an image of sculpture, in full 
 relief. The assassin recognised whose figure it was, just 
 as Martinuzzi caught her in his arms, and fell with her 
 on the pavement. Antoine Ferraro leant over his vic- 
 tims.

 At that moment, the corps de garde, under the com- 
 mand of Bathori, defiled through the cathedral gates, 
 and descrying the wretched group a few paces off, 
 marched up to the fatal spot. There was no need of ex- 
 planation, — the bleeding form of the regent, — the lifeless 
 creature he madly clasped to his heart, and the still- 
 stricken posture of the murderer, holding the gory evi- 
 dence of his guilt in his hand, told their own tale. 
 By Bathori's orders, Ferraro's person was instantly at- 
 tached. 
 
 " What madness caused this tragedy?" he demanded, 
 in a tone of sorrowful reproach. 
 
 " Revenge!" replied Ferraro! "the tyrant killed my 
 father." 
 
 " Your father?" 
 
 " Ay, the graf, Peter Pereny, this noon, at the postern 
 of the palace." 
 
 "Rash, misguided man!" exclaimed Bathori; "I 
 witnessed, from the casement of my prison, the deed you 
 mention ; it was not the hand of his eminence struck the 
 blow, but that of the Marquis Piadena. I saw the mur- 
 derer's face at the moment, and I'll swear it was no other 
 than Castaldo." 
 
 " Great God! my senses wander. — Impossible! that 
 very dagger, found in my father's body, has the name of 
 Martinuzzi graven on its hilt." 
 
 " Reach me the poignard, Bathori," said the dying 
 regent, in feeble accents; " Castaldo wrenched this weapon 
 from my person, at Coloswar," he added, after inspecting 
 it for an instant. 
 
 Ferraro covered his face with his hands, and groaned 
 audibly. 
 
 " But I am not long for life," continued Martinuzzi ; 
 " let me not waste the precious minutes. Some of you 
 summon the magnats, and such as hold authority at this 
 hour; and you, Bathori, bid the Richter Iwan hither, — 
 you will find him in that chamber."

 Agreeably to these directions, the body of the church 
 was soon crowded, and Sigismund rushed, at the first 
 notice, to the fallen cardinal, and prostrated himself on 
 one knee beside him. 
 
 " Nobles of Hungary! and citizens of Hermanstadt !" 
 exclaimed Martinuzzi, collecting his last expiring breath, 
 for the effort; " behold the son of John and Isabella, in 
 the Richter Iwan! He is your king, — I acknowledge his 
 
 claims, — he will explain all to you, and , and absolve 
 
 me , Sigismund! " and Martinuzzi grasped our 
 
 hero's hand, with the convulsive energy of a dying man. 
 " You will save my honour, — and clear me, — will you 
 not? — to Hungary, — to Europe, — to the whole world, — 
 to posterity. My name, oh ! let it not be breathed upon ! — 
 Czerina, — I'll not be long,— my country. — my honour, Si- 
 gismund, my hon — !" These were the last words of 
 George Martinuzzi. — " Revertatur ad terram suam : 
 spiritus redeat ad Deum, qui dedit ilium."* 
 
 As Ferraro, in a state of mind which may be ima- 
 gined, but which we will not stop to describe, was being 
 borne out of the cathedral gates, under the escort of 
 the guard, a voice whispered in his ear. He turned his 
 head, and his eye was transfixed, by the blinding lustre 
 of Isabella's triumphant smile. 
 
 " Know you," she asked, " what caused the death of 
 yonder blighted flower?" 
 
 " Madam ?" said Ferraro. 
 
 " You broke her heart, — you, — you, Ferraro, what time 
 you stabbed her father. Now, fool ! go to prison ;" and 
 casting one last, demoniacal glance upon her victim, 
 which curdled his blood, the haughty dowager passed 
 on, in apparent triumph,., a triumph, which none could

 envy, and which the reader, pitying, not condemning;, 
 the transitory passions of humanity, must leave her to 
 settle, as she can, with her God. 
 
 Castaldo found means, during the conflagration, to 
 escape from the palace ; and, on learning that Marti- 
 nuzzi ( " de scitu et mandata Ferdinandi " ) was slain, he 
 fled, conscience stricken, from Hermanstadt.* 
 
 On the night succeeding the following day, an Emir, 
 attended by a small train of followers, rode up to the 
 ramparts, and requested speech of Iwan. He was ad- 
 mitted, and our hero advanced to welcome him to Her- 
 manstadt, with every demonstration of respect. 
 
 " I make this visit," said the Ottoman, after a short 
 previous parley, " with the view of acknowledging that 
 vast obligation, under which you once laid me, by pre- 
 serving my life." 
 
 Iwan looked surprised. 
 
 The Emir paused ; but, presently, thus proceeded : — 
 " It is contrary to our institutions, you must be informed, 
 for the soldan to sojourn within the walls of any var, 
 or city, but what is his own, by right of conquest, or 
 inheritance ; so, on a late occasion, I found myself under 
 the necessity of bivouacking without these walls, while 
 the greater part of my retinue, pitched their pavilions 
 upon the site of certain dilapidated demesnes, within an 
 arrow's flight of this citadel. In preparing the foun- 
 dations of their temporary residence, certain of my fol- 
 lowers lit upon this casket, and straightwise brought it 
 to me. Accept it at my hands :" and the speaker pre- 
 sented Sigismund with an iron box. " You will find it 
 to contain the only gift, worthy of Sultan Sol y man to 
 make, to the son of his fast friend, John of Zapola ; — the

 The body of Cardinal Martinuzzi was interred with 
 great pomp and solemnity, in the cathedral of Alba 
 Julia, whither it was conveyed in sumptuous state, amidst 
 the tears and lamentations of the whole province. The 
 mightiest in the land, were proud to bear his hearse; 
 and as the long-drawn funeral train, mid the stately 
 tapers, the passing knell, the swelling anthem, and re- 
 quiem of chaunting litanies, moved through the shadowy 
 aisle, the eye missed nothing of glory in his sad so- 
 lemnities, save himself alone.-f His ashes repose by 
 the side of those of the greatest man, next himself, 
 that Hungary ever produced, the famous John Huniades 
 Corvin. 
 
 For months after the celebration of his obsequies, there 
 was a confluence of people from all parts, to Alba Julia, 
 to behold the sepulchre of their beloved regent, with his 
 particular trophies suspended over it. There divers mi- 
 racles were wrought, and, from dawn of day till nightfall, 
 the holy crypt was crowded. 
 
 One afternoon, towards twilight, an aged female, tall, 
 and closely enveloped in her mantle, was heard to laugh 
 hysterically, as she joined the group, assembled round 
 the sepulchre. No notice was taken ; but the next 
 morning, upon flocking to the spot, as usual, the people 
 were startled to discover a human form, stretched stiff 
 and lifeless, at the base of Martinuzzi's monument. t 
 It proved to be that of the same ancient woman, who,

 by some accident, must have been shut within the church, 
 when the doors were closed on the overnight. She had 
 been dead some hours. She was buried just without 
 the north transept of the sacred edifice ; and over her 
 grave was placed, soon after, a plain tablet, having a 
 short Latin inscription, to the following purpose : —
