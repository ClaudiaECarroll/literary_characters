THE INHERITANCE.
CHAPTER I.
As the noblest attribute of man, family pride had been che-
rished, time immemorial, by the noble race of Rossville. Deep
and incurable, therefore, was the wound inflicted on all its
members by the marriage of the Honourable Thomas St. Clair,
youngest son of the Earl of Rossville, with the humble Miss
Sarah Black, a beautiful girl of obscure origin and no fortune.
In such an union there was everything to exasperate, nothing
to mollify, the outraged feelings of the Rossville family; for
youth and beauty were all that Mrs. St. Clair had to oppose
to pride and ambition. The usual consequences, therefore,
were such as always have, and probably always will accom-
pany unequal alliances, -viz. the displeasure of friends, the
want of fortune, the world's dread laugh, and, in short, all
the thousand natural ills that flesh is heir to when it fails in
its allegiance to blood. Yet there are minds fitted to encounter
and to overcome even these-minds possessed of that inherent
nobility which regards honour as something more than a mere
hereditary name, and which seeks the nobler distinction, open
to all, in the career of some honourable profession. But Mr.
St. Clair's mind was endowed with no such powers; for he
was a man of weak intellects and indolent habits, with just
enough of feeling to wish to screen himself from the poverty
and contempt his marriage had brought upon him. After
hanging on for some time in hopes of a reconciliation with
his family, and finding all attempts in vain, he at length con-
sented to banish himself and the object of their contumely to
some remote quarter of the world, upon condition of receiv-
ing a suitable allowance so long as they should remain abroad.
The unfortunate pair, thus doomed to unwilling exile, retired
to France, where Mr. St. Clair's mind soon settled into that
state which acquires its name from the character of its pos-,
sessor, and, according to that, is called fortitude, resignation,
contentment, or stupidity. There, too, they soon sank into
that oblivion which is sometimes the portion of the living as

well as the dead. His father's death, which happened some
years after, made no alteration in his circumstances. The
patrimony to which he expected to succeed was settled on his
children, should he have any, and a slender life annuity was
his only portion.
The natural wish of every human being, the weakest
as well as the wisest, seems to be to leave some memorial of
themselves to posterity-something, if not to tell how their
fathers thought or fought, at least to show how they talked
or walked. This wish Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair possessed in
common with others; but year after year passed away, and it
still remained ungratified, while every year it became a still
stronger sentiment, as death seemed gradually clearing the
way to the succession. At the time of his marriage, Mr. St.
Clair had been the youngest of five sons; but three of his
brothers had fallen victims to war or pestilence, and there
now only remained the present Earl and himself, both alike
childless.
At length, when hope was almost extinct, Mrs. St. Clair
announced herself to be in the way of becoming a mother;
and the emigrants resolved upon returning to their native
land, that their child might there first see the light. Previous
to taking this step, however, the important intelligence was
communicated to Lord Rossville, and also their intention of
immediately proceeding to Scotland, if agreeable to him; at
the same time expressing a wish that he would favour them
with his advice and opinion, as they would be entirely guided
by him in their plans.
Lord Rossville was a man who liked to be consulted, and
to overturn every plan which he himself had not arranged ;
and as Mr. St. Clair had spoken of taking shipping from
Bourdeaux, where they then were, and so going by sea to Scot-
land, Lord Rossville in his answer expressed his decided dis-
approbation of such a scheme, in Mrs. St. Clair's situation,
and in stormy winter weather. But he enclosed a route by
way of Paris, which he had made out for them with his own
hand; and directed them, upon their arrival there, to signify
the same to him, and there to remain until he had resolved
upon what was next to be done, as he had by no means made
up his mind as to the propriety, or at least the necessity, of
their returning to Scotland. The packet also contained an
order for a sum of money, and letters to some friends of his
own at Paris, who would be of service to Mrs. St. Clair. So
far all was kind and conciliating; and the exiles, after much
Selay, set forth upon their journey, according to the rules
prescribed by the Earl; but, within a day's journey of Paris,
Mrs. St. Clair was taken prematurely ill, and there, at an

obscure village, gave birth to a daughter, which, as Mr. St.
Clair sensibly remarked, though not so good as a boy, was
yet better than nothing at all. As the Salique law was not in
force in the Rossville family, the sex of the child was indeed
a matter of little consequence, save in the eyes of those
sturdy sticklers for man's supremacy. Its health and strength
were therefore the chief objects of consideration; and,
although born in the seventh month, it was a remarkably
fine thriving baby, which Mrs. St. Clair, contrary to the com-
mon practice of mothers, ascribed entirely to the excellence
of its nurse.
They had been fortunate enough to meet with a woman of
a superior class, who, having recently lost her husband and
her own infant, had readily adopted this one, and as readily
transferred to it that abundant stock of love and tenderness
which those dealers in the milk of human kindness always
have so freely to bestow on their nursling for the time. Mrs.
St. Clair's recovery was tedious, and her general health she
declared to be so much impaired that she could not think of
encountering the severity of a northern climate. Instead of
prosecuting their journey, therefore, they retired to the south
of France, and, after moving about for_some time, finally
settled there. This was not what the Earl had intended;
for, although pride still opposed his brother's return to Scot-
land, he had, at the same time, wished to have the family
somewhere within the sphere of his observation and control,
—the more especially as, having lately separated from his
lady, his brother's child might now be regarded as presump;
tive heiress to the family honours. He had purposed, and
indeed pressed, to have the little Gertrude transmitted to
him, that she might have the advantage of being trained up
under his own eye ; but to this Mrs. St. Clair would not con-
sent. She declared, in the most polite but decided manner,
her determination never to part with her child, but promised
that, as soon as her health was sufficiently re-established,
they would return to Britain, and that Lord Rossville should
have the direction and superintendence, if he pleased, of the
young heiress's education. But some obstacle, real or pre-
tended, always arose to prevent the accomplishment of this
plan, till at length Mr. St. Clair was struck with a palsy,
which rendered it impossible for him to be removed. Dead
to all the purposes of life, he lingered on for several years,—
one of those melancholy mementos, who, with a human voice
and human shape, have survived everything human besides.
At length death claimed him as his own, and his widow
lost no time in announcing the event to the Earl, and in
craving his advice and protection for herself and daughter.

THE INHERITANCE.
A very polite, though long-winded reply, was received from
Lord Rossville, in which he directed that Mrs. and Miss St.
Clair should immediately repair to Rossville Castle, there to
remain until he should have had time and opportunity fully to
digest the plans he had formed for the pupillage of his niece.
This invitation was too advantageous to be refused, even
although the terms in which it was couched were not very
alluring either to the mother or daughter. With a mixture
of pleasure and regret, they therefore hastened to exchange
the gay vineyards and bright suns of France for the bleak
hills and frowning skies of Scotland.
CHAPTER II.
MANY years had elapsed since Mrs. St. Clair had left her
native land, and those who had known her then could scarcely
have recognised her now, so completely had the tout ensemble
changed its character. The blooming hoyden, with her awk-
ward habits and provincial dialect, had been gradually trans-
formed into the beautiful woman, graceful in her movements,
and polished, though elaborate, in her manners. Though now
long past her meridian, she was still handsome, and to super-
ficial observers could be captivating ; but the change was
merely outward, proceeding from no innate delicacy of thought
or ennobling principle of action. It was solely the result of
nice tact, knowledge of the world, and long intercourse with
foreigners. The mind remained the same, although the
matter had been modified.
In her early days her pride and ambition had been excited
by making what was considered a splendid alliance ; and it
was not till her understanding was thoroughly ripened, that
she made the mortifying discovery that high birth, when
coupled with personal insignificance, adds no more to real dis-
tinction than a flaming sign does to an ill-kept inn. It was
this disappointment which, operating on a naturally proud and
violent temper, had brought into play all the worst qualities
of her nature, and made her look upon the world as indeed a
stage, where all the men and women were merely players.
To act & grand and conspicuous part, and regain the station
her husband's pusillanimity had lost, was therefore now her
sole aim.
It rarely happens that one artificial mind can succeed in
forming another-we seldom imitate what we do not love.
There is something in human nature which recoils from an

9
artificial character even more than from a faulty one; and
where the attempt fails, the revulsion generally produces a
character of a totally different stamp. Mrs. St. Clair had
spared no pains to render her daughter as great an adept in
dissimulation as she was herself; but all her endeavours
had proved unsuccessful, and Miss St. Clair remained pretty
much as nature had formed her-a mixture of wheat and
tares, flowers and weeds. There existed no sort of sym-
pathy or congeniality of mind between the mother and
daughter-there seemed little even of that natural affection
which often supplies the want of kindred feeling or similar
tastes, and which serves to bind together hearts which no
human process ever could have brought to amalgamate. With-
out any point of resemblance in their characters or ideas, there
was consequently little interchange of thought; and when
Gertrude did address her mother, it was more from the over-
flowings of an open heart and buoyant spirits than from any
reciprocity of feeling.
“How I wish I had Prince Houssain's glass,” exclaimed
she, as they drew near the borders of Scotland, “that I
might take a peep at the people I am going amongst ; a
single glance would suffice to give me some idea of them, or
at least to show whether they are the sort of persons it will
be possible for me to love."
• You have formed very high and somewhat presumptuous
ideas of your own powers of discrimination, it seems,” said
Mrs. St. Clair, with a disdainful smile ; “but I should humbly
conceive that my knowledge and experience might prove
almost as useful as your own observations or theories are
likely to do."
“I beg your pardon, mamma, but I did not know
you
had
been acquainted with the Rossville family."
“I am not personally acquainted with any of them-I
never was--I never would have been, but for you. It is
upon your_account I now stoop to a reconciliation, which
otherwise I would have spurned as I have been spurned."
She spoke with vehemence; then in a calmer tone proceeded,
" It is natural that you should wish to know something
of the relations you are going amongst, since there is
nothing more desirable than a previous knowledge of those
whom it is necessary we should please. But it is only from
report I can speak of the Rossville family, though even from
report we may form a tolerably accurate idea of people's
general character. Report then says, that Lord Rossville is
an obstinate, troublesome, tiresome, well-behaved man; that
his sister, Lady Betty, who resides with him, is a harmless,
dull, inquisitive old woman : then there are nephews, sisters'

sons, to one of whom you are probably destined. There is
Mr. Delmour, a weak, formal, parliamentary drudge, son of
Lord Somebody Delmour, and nephew to the Duke of Bur-
lington; and his brother, Colonel Delmour, a fashionable
unprincipled gamester; and Mr. Lyndsay, a sort of quakerish,
methodistical, sombre person-all, of course, brimful of pride
and prejudice. Nevertheless, beware how you contradict
prejudices, even knowing them to be such, for the generality
of people are much more tenacious of their prejudices than of
anything belonging to them; and should you hear them run
out in raptures at such a prospect as this,” pointing to the
long bleak line of Scottish coast, “even this too you must
admire ; even this cold shrubless tract of bare earth and
stone walls, and yon dark stormy sea, you will perhaps be
told (and you must assent) are fairer than the lilied fields and
limpid waters of Languedoc."
Miss St. Clair remained silent for a few moments, contem-
plating the scene before her ; at last she said, “Indeed,
mamma, I do think there is something fine in such a scene as
this, although I can scarcely tell in what the charm consists,
or why it should be more deeply felt than scenes of greater
beauty and grandeur ; but there seems to be something
so simple and majestic in such an expanse of mere earth and
water, that I feel as if I were looking on nature at the begin-
ning of the creation, when only the sea and the dry land had
been formed."
“Rather after the Fall, methinks," said Mrs. St. Clair, with
a bitter smile, as she drew her cloak round her; " at least, I
feel at present much more as if I had been expelled from
Paradise, than as if I were entering it."
The scene was indeed a dreary one, though calculated to ex-
cite emotions in the mind true to nature in all her varied
aspects ; and more especially in the youthful heart, where
novelty alone possesses a charm sufficient to call forth its
admiration. The dark lead-coloured ocean lay stretched
before them ; its dreary expanse concealed by lowering
clouds, while the sea-fowl, clamouring in crowds to the shore,
announced the coming storm. The yet unclothed fields were
black with crows, whose discordant cries mingled with the
heavy monotonous sound of the waves, as they advanced
with sullen roar, and broke with idle splash. A thick mist
was gradually spreading over every object-an indescribable
shivering was felt by every human thing which had bones and
skin to feel-in short, it was an east wind; and the effect of
an east wind upon the east coast of Scotland may have been
experienced, but cannot be described.
To This is dreadful !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, as her teeth

11
chattered in her head, and her skin began to rise into what is
vulgarly termed goose-skin.
" You do look ill, mamma-you are quite a pale blue, and I
certainly feel as I never did before :" and "Miss St. Clair
pulled up the windows, and wrapped her roquelaure still
closer. The French valet and Abigail, who sat on the dicky,
looked round with pitiful faces, as though to ask, “ Qu'est-ce
que cela ?” Even the postilion seemed affected in the same
manner; for, stopping his horses, he drew forth a ponderous
many caped great-coat, and buttoning it up to his nose, with
a look that bade defiance to the weather, he pursued his
route. The air grew colder and colder—the mist became
thicker and thicker-the shrieks of the sea-fowl louder and
louder-till a tremendous hail shower burst forth, and dashed
with threatening violence against the windows of the carriage,
and the undaunted driver was compelled to bend his purple
face beneath its pitiless pelting, while he urged his horses as
if to escape from its influence.
“This is Scotland, and this is the month of May !"
exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, with a groan, as she looked on the
whitened fields, and her thoughts recurred to the smiling
skies and balmy vernal airs of Languedoc.
“Scotland has given us rather a rude welcome, I must con-
fess," said her daughter; “but, happily, I am not super-
stitious; and, see, it is beginning to smile upon us already."
In a few minutes the clouds rolled away—the sun burst
forth in all his warmth and brilliancy—the tender wheat glit-
tered in the moisture—the lark flew exulting aloft—the sea-
fowl spread their white wings, and skimmed over the blue
waters—the postilion slackened his pace, and put off his great-
coat: such is Scotland's varying clime — such its varying
scenery!
CHAPTER III.
Ir was on a lovely evening that the travellers reached their
destination near the western coast of Scotland. The air was
soft, and the setting sun shed his purple light on the moun-
tains which formed the background of the Rossville domains.
The approach wound along the side of a river, which possessed
all the characteristic variety of a Scottish stream—now gliding
silently along, or seeming to stand motionless in the crystal
depth of some shaded pool—now chafing and gurgling, with
lulling sound, over its pebbly bed—while its steep banks pre-

sented no less changing features. In some places they were
covered with wood, now in the first tints of spring—the formal
poplar's pale hue, and the fringed larch's tender green min-
gling with the red seared leaf of the oak, and the brown opening
bud of the sycamore. In others,grey rocks peeped from amidst
the lichens and creeping plants which covered them as with a
garment of many colours, and the wild rose decked them with
its transient blossoms.
Farther on the banks became less precipitous, and gradually
sank into a gentle slope, covered with smooth green turf, and
sprinkled with trees of noble size. The only sounds that min-
gled with the rush of the stream were the rich full song of the
blackbird, the plaintive murmur of the wood pigeon, and the
abrupt but not unmusical note of the cuckoo. Gertrude gazed
with ecstacy on all around, and her heart swelled with delight
as she thought she was destined to inherit this fair scene; and
a vague poetical feeling of love and gratitude to Heaven
caused her to raise her eyes, swimming in tearful rapture, to
the Giver of all good. But it was merely the overflowing of
a young, enraptured, and enthusiastic mind; no deeper prin-
ciple was felt or understood—no trembling mingled with her
joy-no dark future cast its shadow on the mirror imagina-
tion presented to her; but visions of pomp and power, and
wealth and grandeur-visions of earthly bliss—swam before
those eyes which yet were raised from earth to heaven. She
was roused from her reverie by a deep sigh, or rather groan,
from her mother, who leant back in the carriage, seemingly
overcome by some painful sensation either of mind or body.
Miss St. Clair was accustomed to hear her mother sigh, and
even groan, upon very slight occasions, sometimes upon
no occasion at all; but, at present, there was something
that betokened an intensity of suffering too sincere for feign-
ing.
" You are ill, mamma!” exclaimed she in terror, as she
looked on her mother's pale and agitated countenance.
It was some moments ere Mrs. St. Clair could find voice to
answer, but at length, in much emotion, she said, -
“Is it surprising that I should feel, at approaching that
house from which my husband and myself were exiled-nay,
were even denied an entrance ? Can you imagine that I
should be unmoved at the thoughts of beholding that family
by whom we were rendered outcasts, and whom I have only
known as my bitterest enemies ?”
Mrs. St. Clair's voice and her colour both rose as she enu-
merated her injuries.
“Oh! mamma, do not at such a time suffer your mind to
dwell upon those painful recollections; it is natural that

13
melancholy thoughts should suggest themselves ; but-
ah! there is the castle," cried the young heiress, forgetting all
her mother's wrongs as the stately mansion now burst upon
their view; and again her heart exulted as she looked on its
lofty turrets and long range of arched windows glittering in
the golden rays of the setting sun. In another moment they
found themselves at the entrance; a train of richly-liveried
servants were stationed to receive them. Mrs. St. Clair's
agitation increased-she stopped and leant upon her daughter,
who feared she would have fainted; but making an effort, she
followed the servant, who led the way to the presence of his
lord, when, quickly recovering her self-possession, she ad-
vanced, and gracefully presented her daughter, saying, “To
your lordship's generous protection I commit' my fatherless
child."
Lord Rossville was a bulky, portentous-looking person, with
nothing marked in his physiognomy except a pair
of very black
elevated eyebrows, which gave an unvarying expression of
solemn astonishment to his countenance. He had a husky
voice, and a very tedious elocution. He was some little
time in preparing an answer to this address, but at last he
replied,
"I shall, rest assured, madam, make a point of fulfilling,
to the utmost of my power and abilities, the highly-important
duties of the parental office.”.
He then saluted his sister-in-law and niece; and, taking a
hand of each, led them to a tall thin grey old woman, with a
long inquisitive-looking nose, whom he named as Lady Betty
St. Clair.
Lady Betty rose from her seat with that sort of deliberate
bustle which generally attends the rising up and the sitting
down of old ladies, and may be intended to show that it is
not an every-day affair with them to practise such condescen-
sion. Having taken off her spectacles, Lady Betty carefully
deposited them within a large work-basket, out of which
protruded a tiger's head in worsted work, and a volume of a
novel. She next lifted a cambric handkerchief from off a fat
sleepy lap-dog which lay upon her knees, and deposited it on
a cushion at her feet. She then put aside a small fly table,
which stood before her as a sort of outwork ; and, thus freed
from all impediments, welcomed her guests, and after regard-
ing them with looks only expressive of stupid curiosity, she
motioned to them to be seated, and replaced herself with
even greater commotion than she had risen up. Such a re-
ception was not calculated to call forth feelings of the most
pleasurable kind; and Gertrude felt chilled at manners so
different from the bland courtesy to which she had been

accustomed, and her heart sank at the thoughts of being
domesticated with people who appeared so dull and unpleas-
ing. The very apartment seemed to partake of the charac-
ter of its inmates; it had neither the solid magnificence of
ancient times, nor the elegant luxury of the present age ;
neither was there any of the grotesque ornaments of antiquity,
nor the amusing litter of fashionable baubles for the eye to
have recourse to. Lady Betty's huge work-basket was the
only indication that the apartment was inhabited—an air of
stiff propriety, of splendid discomfort, reigned throughout.
The usual, and more than the usual questions, were put by
the Earl and his sister, as to time and distance, and roads and
drivers, and inns and beds, and weather and dust ; and all
were answered by Mrs. St. Clair in the manner most calcu-
lated to conciliate those with whom she conversed-till, in
the course of half an hour, Lord Rossville was of opinion
that she was one of the best-bred, best-informed, most sen-
sible, ladylike women he had ever conversed with—and his
lordship was not a person who was apt to form hasty opinions
upon any subject.
Lord Rossville's character was one of those whose traits,
though minute, are as strongly marked as though they had
been cast in a large mould. But as not even the powers of
the microscope can impart strength and beauty to the object
it magnifies, so no biographer could have exaggerated into
virtues the petty foibles of his mind. Yet the predominating
qualities were such as often cast a false glory around their
possessor - for the love of power and the desire of human
applause were the engrossing principles of his soul. In
strong capacious minds, and in great situations, these incen-
tives often produce brilliant results; but in a weak contracted
mind, moving in the narrow sphere of domestic life, they
could only circulate through the thousand little channels
that tend to increase or impair domestic happiness. As he
was not addicted to any particular vice, he considered him-
self as a man of perfect virtue; and having been, in some
respects, very prosperous in his fortune, he was thoroughly
satisfied that he was a person of the most consummate wis-
dom. With these ideas of himself, it is not surprising that
he should have deemed it his bounden duty to direct and
manage every man, woman, child, or animal, who came within
his sphere, and that, too, in the most tedious and tormenting
manner. Perhaps the most teasing point in his character was
his ambition—the fatal ambition of thousands—to be thought
an eloquent and impressive speaker: for this purpose he al-
ways used ten times as many words as were necessary to
express his meaning, and those too of the longest and

strongest description. Another of his tormenting peculiari-
ties was his desire of explaining everything, by which he
always perplexed and mystified the simplest subject. Yet he
had his good points ; for he wished to see those around him
happy, provided he was the dispenser of their happiness, and
that they were happy precisely in the manner and degree he
thought proper. In short, Lord Rossville was a sort of petty
benevolent tyrant; and any attempt to enlarge his soul, or open
his understanding, would have been in vain. Indeed, his mind
was already full, as full as it could hold, of little thoughts, little
plans, little notions, little prejudices, little whims, and nothing
short of regeneration could have made him otherwise. He
had a code of laws, a code of proprieties, a code of delica-
cies, all his own, and he had long languished for subjects to
execute them upon.
Mrs. St. Clair and her daughter were
therefore no small acquisitions to his family—he looked upon
them as two very fine pieces of wax, ready to receive what-
ever impression he chose to give them; and the humble con-
fiding manner in which his niece had been committed to him
had at once secured both to mother and daughter his favour
and protection. Lady Betty's character does not possess mate-
rials to furnish so long a commentary. She was chiefly re-
markable for the quantity of worsted work she executed,
which, for a person of her time of life, was considered no less
extraordinary than meritorious. She was now employed on
her fifth rug-the colours were orange and blue—the pattern
an orange tiger couchant picked out with scarlet upon an
azure ground. She also read all the novels and romances
which it is presumed are published for the exclusive benefit of
superannuated old women, and sillyyoung ones; such as
“ The Enchanted Head," “ The Invisible Hand," “ The Mi-
raculous Nuptials,” &c. She was now in the midst of “Be-
wildered Affections; or, All is not Lost," which she was
reading, unconsciously, for the third time, with unbroached
delight. Lastly, she carefully watched over a fat, pampered,
ill-natured lap-dog, subject to epilepsy, and asked a great
many useless questions which few people thought of answering.
These were the only members of the family who appeared,
but Lord Rossville mentioned that two of his nephews were
on a visit in the neighbourhood, and might be expected the
following day.
“Since you are now, madam,” said he, addressing Mrs. St.
Clair, “become as it were incorporated in the Rossville family,
it is proper and expedient that you should be made acquainted
with all its members. I do not mean that acquaintance which
a personal introduction conveys, but that knowledge which we
acquire by a preconceived opinion, founded upon the experi-

ence of those on whose judgment and accuracy we can rely.
I shall therefore give you such information regarding the
junior members of this family as observation and opportunity
have afforded me, and which, I flatter myself, may not prove
altogether unacceptable or unavailing." The Earl paused,
hemmed, and proceeded, “The senior of the two juvenile mem-
bers to whom you will, in all probability, be introduced in the
course of a very short period, is Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick
Delmour, of the 19th Dragoons, youngest son of the late Lord
George Delmour, who was second son of James, Duke of Bur-
lington, by the Marchioness of Effenford, widow of the de-
ceased Charles Chaloner, Marquis of Effenford, who died at an
early period, leaving one son, the present Augustus, Marquis of
Effenford, married
to the Lady Isabella Cadrington, daughter
of the Duke of Litchfield, and one daughter, the present much-
admired Countess of Lymington ;-on the other hand, Wil-
liam Henry, the present Duke of Burlington, espoused the
only daughter of that illustrious statesman, John, Earl of
Harleigh, by whom he has issue one son, the Marquis of
Haslingden, now abroad on account of the delicate and preca-
rious state of his health. Thus it happens, and I hope I have
made it sufficiently clear, that certain members of this family
are at the same time united either by consanguinity, or by
collateral connection of no remote degree, with many-I
might say with most of the illustrious families in the sister
kingdom.
“My sister, the Lady Augusta Delmour, widow of the late
Lord George Delmour, at present resides in the metropolis
with her three daughters one of whom is, I understand, on
the eve of forming a highly honourable and advantageous
alliance with the eldest son of a certain baronet of large for-
tune and extensive property in the southern extremity of the
island—but of this it might not be altogether delicate to say
more at present. Colonel Frederick Delmour, then-the sub-
ject of our more immediate consideration-is in himself a
gentleman of figure, fashion, accomplishments, and of very
distinguished bravery in his highly honourable profession.
He has already had the honour of being twice slightly
wounded in the field of battle, and in being made very
honourable mention of in the despatches from the Earl of
Marsham to his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief. In
these respects, the dignity and untarnished honour of the
noble families to wbich he belongs have suffered no diminu-
tion in his person; but it is to his elder brother” (and he
now turned towards Miss St. Clair) “ that we—that is the
Duke of Burlington and myself-look as to one who is to add
still greater lustre to the coronets with which he is so inti-

mately connected. To all the natural advantages, accom-
plishments, and acquirements of his brother, he unites address
and abilities of the highest order, by means of which he has
already acted a most distinguished part in the senate, and bids
fair to become one of the first, if not the first, statesman of
this, or, indeed, of any age.” The Earl paused, as if overcome
with the prophetic visions which crowded on his mind.
“What time of night is it?" asked Lady Betty.
The Earl, recalled from his high anticipations, and reminded
of the lapse of time, resumed his discourse, but in a less lofty
tone. “The junior member of this family, whom I have now
to present to you, is Edward Lyndsay, Esquire, of Lynnwood,
in this county, only child of the late Edward Lyndsay of
Lynnwood, Esquire, and my youngest sister, the deceased
Lady Jane St. Clair. The late Mr. Lyndsay was descended
from an ancient and highly respectable family, but, by certain
ancestral imprudences, was considerably involved and embar-
rassed during his life, insomuch that he was under the neces-
sity of accepting a situation in one of our colonial settlements,
whither he was accompanied by Lady Jane. Both, I lament
to say, fell victims, in a short period, to the pestilential effects
of the climate, leaving this young man, then an infant of three
years and a half old, to my sole protection and guardianship.
How these duties were discharged it is not for me to say; only,
in justice to myself, I deem it right and proper to state, that at
the expiry of the minority the estate then was (I say nothing
of the means or management, let these speak for themselves
-I simply deem it due to myself to state that the estate was
then) free! if it is so no longer; " and the Earl bowed, and
waved his hands in that significant manner which says, “I
wash my hands of it."
The solemn and dignified silence which followed this was
happily broken by the announcement of supper. The even-
ing wore slowly away, for each minute seemed like a drop of
lead to Miss St. Clair, who was more of an age and tempera-
ment to enjoy than to endure. At length it was ended, and
she retired to her apartment with mingled feelings of pleasure
and disappointment.
CHAPTER IV.
The following morning Gertrude rose early, impatient to take
an unmolested survey of what she already looked upon as
her own. The suite of public rooms engaged but little of her
attention; she had already settled, in her own mind, that
2

TIE INHERITANCE,
these must be completely new furnished, and with this sweep-
ing resolution she passed quickly through them, merely stop-
ping to examine the few pictures they contained. An open
door, an almost dark passage, and a turnpike stair, at length
presented themselves as stimulants to her curiosity, and
tempted her to diverge from the straight lines she had
hitherto followed. It was the original part of the building,
to which a modern Gothic front had been affixed, and she
soon found herself in all the inextricable maze of long narrow
passages, leading only to disappointment-steps which seemed
to have been placed only as if on purpose to make people
stumble-and little useless rooms, which looked as if they
had been contrived solely for the pastime of hide and seek.
At length she entered one she guessed to be Lord Ross-
ville's study, and was hastily retreating, when her eye was
caught by an old-fashioned glass door opening upon a shrub-
bery. She tried to open it, but it was locked ; the prospect
from without was alluring, and she felt unwilling to turn
away from it; the windows were but a little distance from
the ground, and, having opened one, and smelt the violets that
grew beneath, her next impulse was to spring lightly through
it into the garden. As she inhaled the fresh morning air,
fraught with the sweets of early summer, where “the scent
comes and goes like the warbling of music,” and looked on
the lovely landscape as it shone in the deep calm radiance of
the morning sun, her heart, exulted, in all the joyousness
of youth and health, in the brightness of creation. She had
wandered to a considerable distance, when, having gained
the top of an eminence, she stood to admire the effect of
some cottages situated on the green shelving bank which
overhung the river. “What a pretty picturesque thing
a cottage is,” thought she to herself; "how gracefully its
smoke rises from among the trees, and contrasts with the
clear atmosphere around! When this is mine, I will certainly
have some pretty cottages built in sight of the castle, and
have the good people to dance on the greensward before
their doors in an evening when their work is done. O, how
easy it must be to be good, when one has the power of doing
good !"
Ignorant of herself and of the nature of the human heart,
Gertrude believed that to will and to do were one and the
same; as yet untaught that all vague baseless schemes of
virtue, all vain romantic dreams of benevolence, are as much
the cobwebs of imagination as the air-built castles of human
happiness, whether of love, glory, riches, or ambition.
The beauty of the morning the interest each object ex-
cited—the song of the birds—the smell of the opening

19
flowers--the sound of the waters—all combined to lull her
visionary mind into an Elysium of her own creating ; and as
she walked along, in all the ideal enjoyment of her Utopian
schemes, she found herself at the door of one of those cot-
tages whose picturesque appearance had charmed her so much
at a distance. A nearer survey, however, soon satisfied her
that the view owed all its charms to distance. Some coarse,
lint-haired, mahogany-faced, half-naked urchins, with brown
legs and black feet, were dabbling in a gutter before the door ;
while some bigger ones were pursuing a pig and her litter,
seemingly for the sole purpose of amusement.
“What a pity those children are all so ugly!”, thought
Miss St. Clair; "it would have been so delightful to have
had them all nicely dressed, and have taught them myself;
but they are so frightful, I could have no pleasure in seeing
them.” However, she overcame her repugnance so far as to
accost them. “Should not you like to be made nice and
clean, and have pretty new clothes ?"
“Ay!" answered one of them, with a broad stare, and still
broader accent.
“And to go to school, and be taught to read, and write,
and work ?"
“Nawl" answered the whole troop with one voice, as they
renewed their splashing with fresh vigour.
Time passed unheeded, and chance, rather than design, led
Miss St. Clair to retrace her steps, when, as she drew near the
castle, she was met by one of the servants, who informed her
that he and several others had been sent in search of her, as
it was long past the breakfast hour, and the family had been
some time assembled. Ashamed of her own thoughtlessness,
she quickened her steps; and desiring the servant to show
the way to the breakfast-room, without waiting to adjust her
dress, she hastily entered, eager to apologise for her trans-
gression. But the dread solemnity that sat on Lord Ross-
ville's brow made her falter in her purpose. With the tea-
pot in one hand, with the other he made an awful wave for
her to be seated. Lady Betty was busy mixing a mess of hot
rolls, cream, and sugar, for her epileptic lap-dog: An im-
pending storm sat on Mrs. St. Clair's face, but veiled under
an appearance of calm dignified displeasure. Gertrude felt as
if denounced by the whole party, she knew not for what,
unless for having been twenty minutes too late for breakfast,
and, in some trepidation, she began to apologise for her
absence. Lord Rossville gave several deep sepulchral hems;
then, as if he had been passing sentence upon a criminal,
said,
" I am not averse to postpone the discussion of this delicate

and painful investigation, Miss St. Clair, until you shall have
had the benefit of refreshment."
Gertrude was confounded. “My lord;" exclaimed she, in
amazement, “I am very sorry if anything has occurred,”-
and she looked round for an explanation.
Lord Rossville hemmed, looked still more appalling, and
then spoke as follows :-
" You are doubtless aware, Miss St. Clair, that in all
countries where civilisation and refinement have made any
considerable progress, female delicacy and propriety are—are
ever held in the highest estimation and esteem.”
His lordship paused ; and, as no contradiction was offered
to this his proem, he proceeded,-
“But you must, or certainly ought to be, likewise aware,
that it is not merely these virtues themselves which must
be carefully implanted, and vigilantly watched over, in the
young and tender female-for even the possession of the
virtues themselves are not a sufficient shield for the female
character. It was a maxim of Julius Cæsar's (unquestionably
the greatest conqueror that ever lived), that his wife must not
only be spotless in herself, but that she must not even
be suspected by others: a maxim that, in my opinion,
deserves to be engraven in letters of gold, and certainly
cannot be too early, or too deeply, imprinted on the young
and tender female breast."
His lordship had gained a climax, and he stopped, over-
powered with his own eloquence. Mrs. St. Clair made a
movement expressive of the deepest attention and most pro-
found admiration.
“Such being my sentiments-sentiments in which I am
borne out by the testimony of one of the greatest men who
ever lived—it is not surprising that I should feel, and feel
deeply too, the glaring indiscretion you have, I grieve to say,
already committed. since your entrance within these walls."
Then, after another solemn pause, during which Miss St.
Clair sat in speechless amazement, he resumed with more
than senatorial dignity.
“I wish to be correctly informed at what hour you quitted
your apartment this morning, Miss St. Clair ?"
“Indeed, my lord, I cannot tell,” answered Gertrude, with
perfect naïveté. “I had forgot to wind up my watch, and I
did not hear any clock strike; but, from the appearance
of the morning, I am sure it was early."
“And what, may I ask, was the mode or manner, Miss St.
Clair, by which you thought proper to quit my house at
80 untimely and unusual an hour ?" demanded the Earl, in a
voice of repressed emotion,

21
Gertrude blushed, -"I am afraid I was guilty of a trans-
gression, my lord, for which I ask your pardon; but, allured
by the fineness of the morning, and the beauty of the scenery,
I was desirous of getting out to enjoy them, and having
in vain tried to make my way through a door, I was tempted
to escape by a window."
Miss St. Clair spoke with so much simplicity and gentleness,
and there was so much sweetness and even melody in her voice
and accent, that any other than Lord Rossville would have
wished her offence had been greater, that her apology might
have been longer. Not so his lordship, who possessed neither
taste nor ear, and was alive to no charm but what he called
propriety. At the conclusion of his niece's acknowledgment,
the Earl struck his forehead, and took or three turns up and
down the room; then suddenly stopping,
“ Are you at all aware, Miss St. Clair, of the glaring—the
-I must say-gross impropriety of such a step in itself-oí
the still more gross construction that will be put upon it by
the world ? The simple fact has only to be told, and one
inference, and but one, will be drawn. You have quitted the
apartment assigned to you under my roof at a nameless, un-
timely, consequently unbefitting hour; and you rashly, wan-
tonly, and improperly precipitate yourself from a window-
and what window? why, the window of my private sitting-
room! A young female is seen issuing from the window of
my study at a nameless hour in the morning-the tale cir-
culates and where, I ask, am I?"
“Where was you ?” asked Lady Betty.
Mrs. St. Clair put her handkerchief to her face.
“I am very sorry, my lord, that I should have done any-
thing to displease you—if I have done wrong-
"If you have done wrong! Good heavens ! is it thus you
view the matter, Miss St. Clair? What I think wrong!
Who that has proper feelings of delicacy and propriety-who
that has a due regard for character and reputation, but must
view the matter precisely as I do? Such a step_and at such
an hour 1"
And his lordskip resumed his troubled walk.
Unacquainted with her uncle's character, and ignorant of
the manners and customs of the country, Gertrude was led to
believe she had committed a much more serious offence than
she had been aware of, and she was at length wrought up to
that degree of distress which the Earl deemed necessary to
mark her contrition. Softened at witnessing the effect of his
power, which he imputed to the fine style of his language, he
now took his niece's hand, and addressed her in what he in-
tended for a more consolatory strain.
“I have considered it my duty-a painful one, doubtless,


## p. 22 (#24) ##############################################

22
THE INHERITANCE.
but, nevertheless, my duty-to point out to you the impro-
priety you have-I hope and believe inadvertently-com-
mitted. As a member of my family, and one for whose actions
the world will naturally consider me responsible, it is neces-
sary that I should henceforth take upon myself the entire
regulation of your manners and conduct in life. “ You,
madam," to Mrs. St. Clair," have delegated to me the autho-
rity of a parent, and I should ill merit so important a trust,
were I to shrink from the discharge of the functions of the
parental office.”
Miss St. Clair's blood ran cold at the thoughts of being
subjected to such thraldom.
“But before dismissing this subject-I trust for ever-let
me here state to you my sentiments with regard to young
ladies walking before breakfast—a practice of which, I must
confess, I have always disapproved. I am aware it is a prac-
tice that has the sanction of many highly respectable autho-
rities who have written on the subject of female ethics ; but
I own I cannot approve of young ladies of rank and family
leaving their apartments at the same hour with chamber-
maids and dairy-maids, and walking out unattended at an
hour when only the lower orders of the people are abroad.
Walking before breakfast, then, I must consider as a most
rude masculine habit—as the Right Honourable Edmund
Burke observes, an air of robustness and strength is highly
prejudicial to beauty' (that is, as I apprehend, female beauty),
while an appearance of fragility is no less essential to it;
and certainly nothing, in my opinion, can be more unbecoming,
more unfeminine, than to behold a young lady seat herself at
the breakfast-table with the complexion of a dairy-maid, and
the appetite of a ploughman. At the same time, I am an
advocate for early rising, as there are, doubtless, many ways
in which young ladies may spend their mornings without
rambling abroad; and you will find, by looking in your
dressing-room, that I have made ample provision for your
instruction, and amusement, and delight. Let morning
walks, therefore, from henceforth have an end." And he
pressed his niece's hand with that air of pompous forgiveness
so revolting from one human being to another. Luckily, his
lordship was here summoned away; but, ere he left the room,
he signified his intention of returning in an hour to show the
ladies what was most worthy of observation in the castle and
demesnes.
Absurd as this scene may appear, few will deny the undue
importance which many people attach to the trifles of life,
and how often mole-hills are magnified into mountains by
those with whom trifles are indeed " the sum of human
things.”

CHAPTER V.
“True as the dial to the sun,
Even though it be not shined upon,"
LORD ROSSVILLE returned, at the hour appointed, to do the
honours of his castle. But, as most of my readers have
doubtless experienced the misery of being shown a house
where there was nothing to be seen, and can tell “ how hard
it is to climb" from the second sunk story to the uppermost
garrets, I shall not be so unmerciful as to drag them “up
stairs and down stairs to my lady's chamber," and into all the
chambers except his lordship's own, which he was too decorous
to exhibit.
There is a mental blindness, darker than that which shrouds
the visual orb; and Nature's works were to Lord Rossville
an universal blank, or rather they were a sort of account-
book, in which were registered all his own petty doings. It
was here he had drained, there he had embanked-here he
had planted, there he had cut down-here he had built a
bridge, there he had made a road-here he had levelled,
there he had raised, &c. &c. To all that his own head had
planned he was feelingly alive ; but, for the “ dread mag-
nificence of heaven," he had neither eye, ear, nor soul, and
must, therefore, be forgiven if insensible to its influence.
Mrs. St. Clair was not much more highly gifted in that
respect, but she could speak, if she could not feel; and she
expatiated and admired, till Lord Rossville thought her,
without exception, the cleverest woman he had ever met
with.
“Since you are so great an enthusiast in the beauties of
nature, my dear madam," said he, addressing his sister-in-
law, we shall extend our drive a little farther than I had
purposed, that I may have the pleasure of showing you, at a
single coup-d'oeil, the whole extent of the Rossville possessions
in this county, while, at the same time, you will embrace
some other objects in which I am not wholly unconcerned.-
Benjamin," (to the servant,) “to Pinnacle Hill;" and to
Pinnacle Hill the horses' heads were turned. Pinnacle
Hill," continued the Earl," is a very celebrated spot : it is a
purchase I made from Lord Fairacre some years ago; it is
much resorted to by strangers, as commanding, with few ex-
ceptions, one of the finest views in Scotland."
Mrs. St. Clair hated fine views, and she tried to get off by

pretending scruples about encroaching so much on his lord-
ship’s time, goodness, and so forth — but all in vain; to
Pinnacle Hill they were driven; and, after being dragged
up as far as horses could go, they were (as, indeed, the name
implied) obliged to alight and ascend on foot. With consider-
able toil they reached the top; and scarcely were they there,
when the wind, having changed to the east, its never-failing
accompaniment, a raw mist, began to gather all round. But
Lord Rossville was insensible even to an east wind-his bodily
sensations being quite as obtuse as his mental ones;
and having
got to the top of the Pinnacle, he faced him round, and, in
the very teeth of the enemy, began to point out what was and
what was not to be seen.
“Here you have a very commanding view, or would have
had, if the atmosphere had been somewhat clearer; as it is, I
can enable you distinctly to trace out the boundary line of the
Rossville estate. Observe the course of the river in the direc-
tion of my cane-you see it plainly here—there it disappears
amongst the Millbank woods—now it takes a turn, and you
have it again to your left-you follow me ?"
Perfectly, my lord,” replied Mrs. St. Clair, although she
saw nothing but a wreath of mist.
“Undoubtedly that must be the river we see," said his lord-
ship, doubtingly; " but, at the same time, we never can rely,
with perfect security, upon the watery element; it has many
prototypes, which are not easily detected at a distance-a
bleachfield, for instance, has not unfrequently been mistaken
for a piece of water; and we read of a very singular decep-
tion produced upon sand in the eastern countries, and termed
the mirage."
“ Water is, indeed, a deceitful element," said Mrs. St.
Clair, hoping, by this affirmative, to get to the lee-side of the
discussion.
“On the other hand, it is a most useful and invaluable ele-
ment; without water, where would be our navigation-our
commerce-our knowledge-our arts ?-in one word, water
may be termed the bulwark of Britain."
“It may, indeed,” said Mrs. St. Clair, her teeth chattering
as she spoke ; " to water we owe our existence as a nation,
our liberties, civil and religious ;” and she retreated a few
steps on the faith of having settled the matter.
“Pardon me there, my dear madam,” said the Earl, retain-
ing his original footing ; " that is, perhaps, going a little too
far. Strictly speaking, we cannot, with propriety, be said to
owe our existence to water, since, had we not been an island,
(a highly-favoured island I) we should certainly have formed
part of the vast continent of Europe—and with regard to our
liberties, the Magna Charta, that boast of Britain, was un-

game at this
questionably procured, and I trust, will ever be maintained,
on terra firma."
Mrs. St. Clair could almost have given up the
point-to stand on the very pinnacle of a pinnacle, in the face
of an east wind, and be talked to about bulwarks and Magna
Chartas-it was too much!
“ How very cold you look, mamma," said Miss St. Clair,
compassionating her mother's feelings.
“Cold !" repeated Lord Rossville, in a tone of surprise and
displeasure ; "impossible-cold in the month of May! The
day would be too hot, were it not for this cooling breeze."
This was worse and worse-Mrs. St. Clair groaned inter-
nally, as she thought "how will it be possible to drag out
existence with a man who calls a piercing east wind a cooling
breeze?"
Lord Rossville raised his cane, and resumed his observations
at great length upon the ravages committed by the river on
his friend and neighbour Boghall's property. Mrs. St. Clair
wished the Boghall acres in the bottom of the Red Sea, though
even from thence Lord Rossville might, perhaps, have fished
them up; as a thorough-bred tormentor, like a first-rate
magician, can call spirits, even from the vasty deep, to tor-
ment his victims.
“Here," continued the Earl, taking his sister-in-law by
the hand, and leading her to the utmost verge of all she
hated—a bleak exposed promontory; "here we command a
no less charming prospect in a different style :-observe that
range of hills.”
Superb !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, with an aguish
shudder.
“Why, yes—the hills themselves are very well: but do
you observe nothing, my dear madam, that relieves the eye
from what a friend of mine justly calls • a boundless continuity
of shade?'"
Mrs. St. Clair almost cracked her eyeballs straining in the
direction pointed out; but, like sister Anne, could see nothing
to the purpose.
“I suspect you are looking rather too high ; nearer the
base, and allow your eye to run along by the point of my
cane—there, you must have got it now.
There are, perhaps, few every-day situations more tormento
ing to a delicate mind than that of being called upon to
see what you cannot see—you must either disappoint the
views of the view-pointer, or you must sacrifice your con-
science (as it is much to be feared too many do), by pretend-
ing that you have at last hit the mark, whether it be a puff

of smoke indicative of a town, a white cloud of the ocean,
or a black speck of an island.
“Ah! I think I discover something now," cried Mrs. St.
Clair, quite at a loss to guess whether the white mote in
question was a church steeple, or a ship's mast, or any other
wonderful object of the same nature, which generous long-
sighted people will always make a point of sharing with their
less gifted friends.
you think the effect good ?"
“ Admirable-inimitable !"
"Why, the situation was my own choice; there was a com-
mittee appointed to make choice of the most favourable site,
and they fortunately fell in with my views on the subject,
and, indeed, paid me the compliment of consulting my feel-
ings on the occasion :—a public monument, I conceive, ought,
undoubtedly, to be placed in a conspicuous and elevated situa-
tion; but more especially when that situation happens to be
in the very grounds of not only the original proposer and
principal heritor in the county, but likewise the personal
friend of the illustrious dead to whom this tribute is decreed
-for, I am proud to say, our renowned patriot, the great
Lord Pensionwell, was (with the excellent Lord Dunderhead)
the associate of my youthful years—the friend of my maturer
“Happy the country,” said Mrs. St. Clair, now driven
almost to frenzy, “whose nobles are thus gifted with the
power of reflecting, kindred excellence, and perpetuating
national virtue, on the broad basis of private friendship !"
Mrs. St. Clair knew she was talking nonsense ; but she
also knew who she was talking to, and was sure it would pass.
Lord Rossville, to be sure, was a little puzzled; but he saw
it was meant as a compliment, and contained a fine-sounding
sentiment, and it was therefore well received. Fortunately,
the rain now began to fall; and every object being completely
shrouded in mist, his lordship was obliged to give in; but he
comforted himself, and thought he comforted his companions,
by promising to return, when the weather was more propitious,
to repeat and complete their enjoyment.

tion in the company. Lady Betty asked what that was, while
she took her favourite on her lap, and covered it with her
pocket-handkerchief; from beneath which, however, issued,
ever and anon, a low asthmatic growl.
" It is Colonel Delmour, my lady," answered the pompous
maître d'hotel, who had despatched a messenger to inquire.
“It is an extraordinary and somewhat improper time of
night, I think
But his lordship’s remarks were stopped by the entrance of
the party in question. Merely touching his uncle's hand as
he passed him, and scarcely noticing Lady Betty, Colonel
Delmour advanced to Mrs. and Miss St. Clair, and paid his
compliments to them with all the graceful high-bred ease of
a man of fashion; then calling for a chair, he seated himself
by his cousin, seemingly regardless of one having been placed
by Lord Rossville's orders on the other side of the table.
Colonel Delmour was strikingly handsome, both in face and
form; and he possessed that high hereditary air of fashion
and freedom which bore the impress of nobility and distinc-
tion. There might, perhaps, be something of hauteur in his
lofty bearing ; but it was so qualified by the sportive gaiety
of his manners, that it seemed nothing more than that elegant
and graceful sense of his own superiority, to which, even
without arrogance, he could not be insensible. He talked
much, and well, and in that general way which allowed every
one to take a part in the conversation without suffering any
one, not even the Earl, to monopolise it. Altogether, his
presence was like sunshine upon frost-work, and an air of
ease and gaiety succeeded to the dulness and constraint which
had hitherto prevailed. Lady Betty had three times asked,
“What brought you here at this time of night?” before
Colonel Delmour answered ; at last he said, —
"Two very powerful motives, though scarcely fit to be
named together—the first was my eagerness to do homage
here," bowing gracefully to Miss Št. Clair;
66 the other was
to avoid the honour of driving Miss Pratt.”
“I thought Mr. Lyndsay was to have returned with you,"
said the Earl.
“I offered him a seat in my curricle, which he wanted to
transfer to Miss Pratt, but I could not possibly agree to that
arrangement; so he remains like a preux chevalier to escort
her in a hackney-chaise, and also, I believe, to attend a Bible
meeting, or a charity sermon, or something of that sort. It
is more, I suspect, as a paymaster than a protector, that his
services are required, as he discovered it would cost her I
can't tell how many shillings and sixpences; and though I
would willingly have paid her expenses, yet really to endure

her company for a nine-mile tête-à-tête was more than my
philosophy dreamt of.”
Much depends on the manner in which things are said as
to the impression they convey to the unreflecting mind.
Colonel Delmour's voice and accent were uncommonly pleas-
ing; and he had an air of gay good-humour that gave to his
words rather the semblance of airy levity, than of selfishness
or ill-nature. Even when he carelessly sketched on the
tablecloth a caricature of Mr. Lyndsay, with a large Bible
under his arm, handing Miss Pratt, with a huge bandbox in
hers, into a hackney-chaise, Gertrude could not resist a smile
at their expense.
“Miss Pratt coming here to-morrow !” exclaimed the Earl
in a tone expressive of anything but pleasure; "that is some-
what an unexpected and his lordship made an effort as
if to bolt some word too hard for utterance. Then address-
ing Mrs. St. Clair, though with a very disturbed look, “ As,
in all probability, madam, that lady's visit is designed out of
compliment to you and your daughter, it is necessary, pre-
vious to her arrival, that you should be aware of the degree
of relationship subsisting between Miss Pratt and the mem-
bers of this family.”
Lord Rossville's air, looks, manner, hems, all portended a
story; it was but too evident that breath was collecting and
reminiscences arranging for the purpose, and the pause that
ensued was prophetic-not, alas! of its end, but of its begin-
ning. But Colonel Delmour seemed quite aware of the danger
that was impending; and just as his uncle had opened his
mouth with “ Miss Pratt's great-grandfather—"he inter-
posed.
"I beg pardon, but I cannot think of devolving the task of
being Miss Pratt's chronicler upon you; as I was guilty
of introducing her to the company, mine be the punishment
of becoming her biographer." Then, with a rapidity which
left the Earl with his mouth open, and Miss Pratt's great-
grandfather still vibrating on his tongue, he went on,-
“Miss Pratt, then, by means of great-grandfathers and
great-grandmothers (who, par parenthèse, may commonly be
classed under the head of great bores), is, somehow or other,
cousin to all families of distinction, in general, throughout
Scotland, but to this one, from its local advantages, in particu-
lar. I cannot pretend to show forth the various modifications
of which cousin-ship is susceptible,—first, second, and third
degrees, as far as numbers and degrees can go. And, indeed,
I have already committed a great error in my outset, by hav-
ing introduced Miss Pratt by herself Miss Pratt, when I ought
to have presented her as Miss Pratt and Anthony Whyte. In

fact, as Whittington without his cat would be nobody in the
nursery, so neither would Miss Pratt be recognised in the
world without Anthony Whyte. Not that there exists the
same reciprocal attachment, or unity of fortune, between the
aunt and the nephew which distinguished the master and his
cat; for Anthony White is rich, and Miss Pratt is poor-
Anthony White lives in a castle, Miss Pratt in a cottage-
Anthony Whyte has horses and hounds, Miss Pratt has clogs
and pattens. There is something so uninteresting, if not un-
promising, in the name, that"_addressing himself to Miss
St. Clair—"you, at present, will scarcely care whether it
belongs to a man or a cat, and will be ready to exclaim,
• What's in a name?' But do not expect long to enjoy the
happy state of indifference-by dint of hearing it repeated
day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute, upon
every possible and impossible occasion, it will at length take
Buch hold of your imagination that you will see the mystic
letters which compose the name of Anthony Whyte wherever
you turn your eyes—you will be ready to halloo out his name
to the reverberate rocks, and teach the babbling gossips of the
air to cry out'-Anthony Whyte !"
" What's all that nonsense ?" asked Lady Betty.
“I have been rather prosy upon Miss Pratt and her adjunct
—that's all," answered Colonel Delmour slightly; " and must
have something to put away the sound of Anthony Whyte"-
and he hummed a few notes. “Do, Miss St. Clair, join me
in expelling those hideous names I have invoked for your
gratification-you sing, I am sure.
But Gertrude was afraid to comply, for no one seconded
the request. Lord Rossville, indeed, looked evidently much
displeased; but it was no less manifest that his nephew
neither thought nor cared for anybody's feelings but such
as he was solicitous to please; and, before the party, broke
up, he had contrived to make a very favourable impression
on the only person present whose favour he was anxious to
obtain,

CHAPTER VII.
MANY visitors arrived the two following days from various
quarters, though all from similar motives,—viz. to see the
young heiress and her plebeian mother. But amongst all the
varieties of life, how few can even serve “ to point a moral or
adorn a tale."
The most distinguished of those individuals were Lady

Millbank and her daughters, who drove up in all the bustle
and parade of a barouche and four, splendidly emblazoned,
with drivers and riders in the full pomp of blazing liveries,
and, in short, the usual éclat of an equipage which at once
denotes wealth and grandeur. The ladies were in the same
style with their outward bearings,-tall, showy, dashing per-
sonages, with scornful looks and supercilious manners. They
surveyed Miss St. Clair from head to foot with a bold stare';
and, after making some trifling remarks to her, turned their
whole artillery against Colonel Delmour, who received their
addresses with a sort of careless familiarity, very different from
the refined attentions he displayed towards his cousin.
“Good heavens !” exclaimed one of the ladies, who had
stationed herself at a window," do look at this, Colonel Del-
mour!”
And at the piercing exclamation, the whole party hastened
to ascertain the cause. The phenomenon appeared to be a
hackney-chaise of the meanest description, which was dis-
placing the splendid barouche, to the manifest mirth of the in-
solent menials who stood lounging at the door.
“Who can that be, I wonder ? asked Lady Betty.
Mrs. St. Clair turned pale with terror, lest it should be any
of her bourgeois relations forcing their way.
“I conclude it must be our cousin Miss Pratt," said the
Earl, in some agitation, to Lady Millbank; and, while he
spoke, a female head and hand were to be seen shaking and
waving to the driver with eager gesticulation.
“ And Mr. Lyndsay, I vowI" exclaimed Miss Jemima Mill-
bank, throwing herself into a theatrical attitude of astonish-
ment.
The hack-chaise, with its stiff resty horses, had now got
close to the door; and the broken jingling steps being
lowered, out stepped a young man, who was immediately
saluted with shouts of laughter from the party at the win-
dow. He looked up and smiled, but seemed nowise discon-
certed, as he stood patiently waiting for his companion to
emerge.
"I
hope they are to perform quarantine," said Colonel Del-
“I vote for their being sent to Coventry,” said Miss Au-
gusta.
"I prepare to stand upon the defensive," said Miss Maria,
as she seized a smelling-bottle from off the table.
At length Miss Pratt appeared, shaking the straw from her
feet; and having alighted, it was expected that her next move-
ment would be to enter the house ; but they knew little of
Miss Pratt, who thought all was done when she had reached
mour.

her destination. Much yet remained to be done, which she
would not trust either to her companion or the servants. She
had, in the first place, to speak in a very sharp manner to the
driver, on the condition of his chaise and horses, and to throw
out hints of having him severely punished, inasmuch as one
of his windows would not let down, and she had almost
sprained her wrist in attempting it—and another would not
pull up, though the wind was going through her head like a
spear; besides having taken two hours and a quarter to bring
them nine miles, and her watch was held up in a triumphant
manner in proof of her assertion. She next made it a point
to see with her own eyes every article pertaining to her (and
they were not a few) taken out of the chaise, and to give with
her own voice innumerable directions as to the carrying, stow-
ing, and placing of her bags, boxes, and bundles. All these
matters being settled, Miss Pratt then accepted the arm of her
companion, and was now fairly on her way to the drawing-
room. But people who make use of their eyes have often
much to see even between two doors, and in her progress from
the hall-door to the drawing-room door Miss Pratt met with
much to attract her attention. True, all the objects were
perfectly familiar to her; but a real looker, like a great
genius, is never at a loss for a subject-things are either better
or worse since they saw them last-or if the things themselves
should happen to be the same, they have seen other things
either better or worse, and can, therefore, either improve or
disprove them. Miss Pratt's head then turned from side to
side a thousand times as she went along, and a thousand ob-
servations and criticisms about stair-carpets, patent lamps,
hall chairs, slab tables, &c. &c. &c. passed through her crowded
brain. At length Miss Pratt and Mr. Lyndsay were announced,
and thereupon entered Miss Pratt in a quick paddling man-
ner, as if in all haste to greet her friends.
“How do you do, my lord? No bilious attacks I hope of
late.-Lady Betty as stout as ever I see, and my old friend
Flora as flat as a collared eel.–Lady Millbank, I'm perfectly
ashamed to see you in any house but your own; but every-
thing must give way to the first visit, you know, especially
amongst kinsfolk," taking Mrs. St. Clair by the hand, with-
out waiting for the ceremony of an introduction.
While this and much more in the same strain was passing
with Mrs. Pratt at one end of the room, Mr. Lyndsay had
joined the younger part of the company at the other, and
been introduced by Colonel Delmour to Miss St. Clair. There
was nothing so striking in his appearance as to arrest the care-
less eye, or call forth instant admiration; yet his figure,
though not much above the middle size, was elegant, his head

and features were finely formed, and altogether he had that
sort of classical tournure which, although not conspicuous, is
uncommon, and that air of calm repose which indicates a
mind of an elevated cast. Still, seen beside Colonel Delmour,
Mr. Lyndsay might have been overlooked. He had nothing
of that brilliancy of address which distinguished his cousin;
but he had what is still more rare, that perfect simplicity of
manner which borrows nothing from imitation; and, as some
one has well remarked, few peculiarities are more striking
than a total absence of all affectation. Scarcely allowing
time for the introduction, Miss Millbank began in a tone in-
tended to be very sympathetic.
“How dreadfully you must have been bored to-day with la
Good heavens ! how could you inflict such a
penance upon yourself? Did you not find her most shock-
ingly annoying and dreadfully tiresome ?"
" Annoying and tiresome to a certain degree, as everybody
must be who asks idle questions,” answered Mr. Lyndsay,
with a smile, which, though very sweet, was not without a
meaning
The rebuff, if it was intended for such, was, however, lost
upon his fair assailant.
" Then how could you bore yourself with her ?"
“She was my mother's friend and relation," replied he
calmly.
“ Of all descriptions of entail, that of friends would be the
most severe,” said Colonel Delmour.
“O heavens! what a shocking idea !" exclaimed the three
Miss Millbanks in a breath.
What's the shocking idea, my dears ?" demanded Miss .
Pratt, as she pattered into the midst of the group. " I'm
sure there's no shocking realities here, for I never saw a
prettier circle,” darting her eyes all round, while she fami-
liarly patted Miss St. Clair, and drawing her arm within hers,
as she stood by the window, seemed resolved to appropriate
her entirely to herself. Gertrude's attention was no less ex-
cited by Miss Pratt, who had to her all the charms of novelty;
for though there are many Miss Pratts in the world, it had
never been her fortune to meet with one till now.
Do you know I'm really puzzled, my dear, to make out
who it is you are so like—for you're neither a Rossville nor a
Black-and, by-the-bye, have you seen your uncle, Mr.
Alexander Black, yet? What a fine family he has got. I
heard you were quite smitten with Miss Lilly Black at the cir-
cuit ball t'other night, Colonel Delmour ; but you're not so
ill to please as Anthony Whyte. That was really a good
thing Lord Punmedown said to him that night. Looking at

the two Miss Blacks, says he to Anthony with a shake of his
head—Ah, Anthony,' says he, 'I'm afraid two Blacks will
never make a White ! ha! ha! ha!-Lord Rossville, did you
hear that? At the circuit ball Lord Punmedown said to
Anthony Whyte, pointing to the two Miss Blacks—'I fear,
says he, 'two Blacks will never make a White.'— No, my
Lord,' says Anthony, ‘for you know there's no turning a
Blackamoor white ! ha! ha! ha! “A very fair answer,' says
my lord. Lady Millbank, did you hear of Lord Punme-
down's attack upon Mr. Whyte at the ball—the two Miss
Blacks-
“I black-ball a repetition of that bon mot,” said Colonel
Delmour.
“You will really be taken for a magpie if you are so black
and white," said Miss Millbank.
“ 'Pon my word, that's not at all amiss—I must let Anthony
Whyte hear that. But bless me, Lady Millbank, you're not
going away already ? — won't you stay and take some lun-
cheon ?-I can answer for the soups here—I really think, my
lord, you rival the Whyte Hall soups ;” but, disregarding
Miss Pratt's pressing invitation, Lady Millbank and her train
took leave, and scarcely were they gone when luncheon was
announced.
“Come, my dear," resumed the tormentor, holding Ger-
trude's arm within hers, “ let you and I keep together-I
want to get better acquainted with you; but I wish I could
find a likeness for you"-looking round upon the family por-
traits as they entered the eating-room.
“ They must look higher who would find a similitude for
Miss St. Clair,” said Colonel Delmour.
Miss Pratt glanced at the painted ceiling, representing a
band of very fat full-blown rosy Hours.
" Ah ha! do you
hear that, my lord ?-Colonel Delmour says there's nothing
on earth to compare to Miss St. Clair, and that we must look
for her likeness in the regions above. Well, goddess or not,
let me recommend a bit of this nice cold lamb to you—very
sweet and tender it is; and I assure you I'm one of those who
think a leg of lamb looks as well on a table as in a meadow :'
- then dropping her knife and fork with a start of joy—“Bless
me, what was I thinking of ?—that was really very well said
of you, Colonel —but I've got it now—a most wonderful re-
semblance! See who'll be the next to find it out?”
All present looked at each other, and then at the pictures.
Lord Rossville, who had been vainly watching for an open-
ing, now took advantage of it; and with one of his long-sup-
pressed sonorous hems, bespoke him as follows :-

to the study of physiognomy, as I do not conceive it is one
likely to be productive of beneficial results to society, yet I
do not hesitate to admit the reality of those analogies of fea-
ture which may be, and undoubtedly are, distinctly traced
through successive generations—the family mouth, for ex-
ample," pointing to a long-chinned, pinky-eyed female, with a
pursed-up mouth, hanging aloft, “as portrayed in that most
exemplary woman, the Lady Janet St. Clair, has its prototype
in that of my niece," turning to Gertrude; "while, in the
more manly formed nose of Robert, first Earl of Rossville,
an accurate physiognomist might discern the root, as it

were
“My dear Lord Rossville !” exclaimed Miss Pratt, throw-
ing herself back in her chair, “I hope you're not going to
say Miss St. Clair has the nose of Red Robby, as he was
called. Root, indeed! a pretty compliment! If it was a
root, it must have been a beet-root—as Anthony Whyte says,
it's a nose like the handle of a pump-well; and as for Lady
Janet's mouth, he says it's neither more nor less than a slit in
a poor's-box.”
" Mr. Anthony Whyte takes most improper liberties with
the family of St. Clair, if he presumes to make use of such
unwarrantable, such unjustifiable, I may add, such ungentle-
manly expressions, towards any of its members,” said Lord
Rossville, speaking faster in the heat of his indignation ;
" and it is mortifying to reflect, that any one allied to this
family should ever have so far forgot what was due to it as to
form such coarse, and vulgar, and derogatory comparisons.”
“One of them is rather a flattering comparison," said Mr.
Lyndsay; " I'm afraid there are few mouths can be repre-
sented as emblems of Charity."
“Very well said, Mr. Edward," said Miss Pratt, nowise
disconcerted at the downset she had received ; "shall I send
you this nice rib in return ?—Lord Rossville, let me recom-
mend the rhubarb tart to you.—Miss Diana, my dear-I beg
your pardon, Miss St. Clair, but I'll really never be able to
call you anything but Diana-for such a likeness !—What
have you all been thinking of, not to have found out that Miss
St. Clair is the very picture of the Diana in the Yellow
Turret?"
Lord Rossville, in a tone of surprise and displeasure, re-
peated,-
" The Diana in the Yellow Turret! impossible !"
“Impossible or not, I can assure you it's the fact. Mrs. St.
Clair, have you seen the Diana ? come with me, and I'll show
it you—come, my dear, and see yourself as a goddess—come
away-seeing's believing, my lord.” And she jumped up,

almost choking in her eagerness to display the discovery
she had made.
" Miss Pratt !" cried the Earl, in a tone enough to have
settled quicksilver itself, “Miss Pratt, this behaviour of yours
is-is-what I cannot possibly permit—the Yellow Turret is
my private dressing-room, and it is surely a most improper
and unwarrantable liberty-
“I beg you ten thousand pardons, my dear Lord Rossville !
- I really had quite forgot the change you have made in your
dressing-room; but, at any rate, I would have figured every
creek and corner of yours fit to be seen at all times. There's
Mr. Whyte—his dressing-room is a perfect show, so neat and
nick-nacky,—his silver shoe-horn would be an ornament to
any drawing-room.”
* Miss Pratt, this is really-I-" And his lordship
hemmed in a manner which showed the greatest discom-
posure.
6 As we cannot gratified w a sight of Mr. Whyte's
shoe-horn,” said Colonel Delmour, “it would certainly be
some solace to be allowed to behold your lordship’s goddess;
I had forgot that picture, it is so long since I have seen it-
but I should certainly wish to prostrate myself at her shrine
now.” And he looked to Miss St. Clair as he spoke, in a
manner to give more meaning to his words than met the ear.
The Earl was much embarrassed. He was provoked at the
irreverent and indecorous manner in which Miss Pratt had
been going to rush into his dressing-room; and he was
piqued at the insinuation she had thrown out of its not being
fit to be seen. He therefore wavered betwixt his desire of
punishing her presumption by exclusion, or vindicating his
own character by instant and unpremeditated admission.
After maturely weighing the matter he decided upon the
latter mode of proceeding, and said,
-
“ Although I have certainly no idea of permitting my pri-
vate apartments to be thrown open whenever idle or imperti-
nent, or, it may be, ill-disposed curiosity, might prompt the
wish, yet I do not object to gratify either my own family and
friends, or even the public in general, with a view of them,
when the request is properly conveyed, and at a proper and
reasonable hour; for, if there is a time for everything, it
should likewise be remembered there is a manner for every-
thing; and although I do not consider a gentleman's dress-
ing-room as the most elegant and delicate exhibition for
ladies, yet, upon this occasion, if they are so inclined,” bow.
ing all round, “I shall be happy to conduct them to my
private apartments."
“ The sooner the better," cried Miss Pratt, while the very

ribbons on her bonnet seemed to vibrate with impatience.
“Come, my dear, and see yourself as a goddess ;" and again
seizing Miss St. Clair, away she pattered full speed.
- There's a broom where a broom shouldn't be," darting
her eyes into the dark corner of a passage as she whisked
through it; then peeping into a closet, " and for all the work
he makes I don't think his maids are a bit better than other
people’s."

means
UPON entering the turret, the first thing that caught Miss
Pratt's eye was a shaving-glass, which she asserted was by no
the proper size and shape for that purpose, being quite
different from the one used by Anthony Whyte, which was
broader than it was long, while Lord Rossville's was longer
than it was broad. A dispute, of course, ensued, for the
Earl would not be bearded upon such a subject by any woman
--when, suddenly giving him the slip in the argument, she
exclaimed, “ But bless me, we're forgetting the Diana-and
what a bad light you've put her in! There's a great art in
hanging pictures: Mr. Whyte brought a man all the way
from London to hang his; and I'll never forget my fright
when he told me the hangman was coming. Now I see her
where I stand-Mrs. St. Clair, come a little more this way-
there now—was there ever such a likeness ?”
“ Astonishing !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair in amazement.
“ Diana never had such incense offered to her before," said
Colonel Delmour.
6. The resemblance, if, indeed, there is a resemblance," said
the Earl, in manifest displeasure, “is extremely imperfect ;
the portrait represents a considerably larger and more robust-
looking person than Miss St. Clair; it has also something of
a bold and masculine air, which, I own, I should be sorry to
perceive in any young lady in whom I take any interest ;
since nothing, in my opinion, derogates so much from female
loveliness as a forward or presuming carriage.”.
My dear Lord Rossville ! how anybody who has eyes in
their head can dispute that resemblance-just turn round, my
dear, and show yourself," to Miss St. Clair, who, ashamed of
the scrutiny, had turned away, and was conversing with
Colonel Delmour a little apart. Mr. Lyndsay contemplated
the picture with a thoughtful air, and occasionally stole a
glance at Gertrude, but said nothing.
“How do you account for such an extraordinary likeness ? "

inquired Lady Betty of Mrs. St. Clair, as she stood, with her
fat Flora under her arm, staring at the picture.
“I am quite at a loss—if this picture is an ideal creation
of the painter's imagination-"
“It's not that, I can assure you,” interrupted Miss Pratt;
“the original was a real flesh and blood living person, or I've
heen misinformed,” with a look of interrogation to Lord
Rossville.
“ If one of the family, however remote, the resemblance,
as Lord Rossville justly remarked, does sometimes revive,
even at distant periods, in the person of - ;" but Mrs.
St. Clair did not get leave to finish her sentence.
* O, if Diana had been a St. Clair, there would have been
no wonder in the matter, you know !" again dashed in the in-
tolerable Pratt; “but the truth of the matter is, she was
neither more nor less than bonny Lizzie Lundie, the hunts-
man's daughter. Much I've heard about Lizzie Lundie, and
many a fine song was made upon her, for she was the greatest
beauty in the country, high or low. There's one of the songs
that's all the fashion now, that I remember singing when
was young, but they've changed the name from Lundie to
Lyndsay;" and Miss Pratt, in a cracked and unmusical voice,
struck up
“Will you go to the Hielands, Lcezy Lyndsay," &c.
Lord Rossville seemed somewhat disconcerted at this
abrupt disclosure of his Diana's humble pedigree; and,
anxious to account for Lizzie Lundie, the huntsman's daugh-
ter, being permitted a place amongst the nobles of the land,
and that too in his private apartment, he therefore made all
possible haste to atone for this solecism in dignity; and
having hemmed three times, began-
“Since this picture has attracted so much attention, and
called forth so much animadversion, it is proper, and, indeed,
necessary, that some elucidation should be thrown on the cir-
cumstances to which it owes its birth."
And again the Earl paused, hemmed, and looked round,
like a peacock spreading its plumage, and straining its neck in
all directions, before it can even lift the crumb that has been
thrown to it, while Miss Pratt, like a pert active sparrow,
taking advantage of its attitudes, darts down and bears off the
prize.
“O, the story's soon told, for there's no great mystery about
it. The late lord there," (pointing to a picture of a fat
chubby gentleman in a green coat, hunting-horn, and bag-
wig,) was a second Nimrod in his young days, and had a
perfect craze for dogs and horses; and he brought a famous

painter here from some place abroad-I forget the name of it
now—to take the beasts’ likenesses: as old Lady Christian
used to say, it was a scandal to think of dogs sitting for their
pictures-ha! ha! ha! In particular, there was a famous
pack of hounds to sit, and the painter chancing to see Lizzie
one day with them about her, was struck with the fancy of
doing her as a Diana ; and it was really a good idea, for I
think she's the outset of the picture-Anthony, Whyte says
he would give a hundred guineas merely for her head and
shoulders.'
Mrs. St. Clair had changed colour repeatedly during this
piece of biography, and seemed not a little mortified at dis-
covering that her daughter's beauty claimed no higher ori-
ginal than the huntsman's daughter. Upon a more close
inspection she therefore declared that although there might
be something in the tout ensemble to catch the eye at first
sight, yet, upon examination, it would be found the features
and expression were totally different.
But Lord Rossville, resolved not to be baulked of his
story, now commenced a more diffuse narrative of the cir-
cumstances to which Lizzie Lundie owed her posthumous
fame, concluding with his most unqualified dissent as to the
possibility of there being the slightest resemblance, except in
the colour of the hair. But, to do Miss Pratt justice, the
resemblance was very remarkable. The Diana's features
were on a larger scale, and her countenance had a less soft
and intellectual cast than Miss St. Clair's; her figure was
also more robust than elegant, her complexion rather vivid
than transparent, and her air rather bold than dignified; but
there was the same long-shaped, soft, dark-blue eyes; the
same Grecian nose and mouth; the same silky, waving, dark
ringlets, curling naturally around the open ivory forehead, -
forming altogether that rare and peculiar style of beauty
where the utmost delicacy of feature is yet marked and ex-
pressive, and the strongest contrasts of colour are blended
into one harmonious whole.
“Pray, what became of this divinity ?" inquired Colonel
Delmour.
“ I'm sure I can't tell you; I think the story was, that she
had been crossed in love with some gentleman, and that she
married a Highland drover, or tacksman, I can't tell which,
and they went all to sticks and staves."
“How provoking,” said Colonel Delmour, as he still stood
contemplating the picture, “that so much beauty should have
been created in vain !"
“ How do you know that it was created in vain ?" said Mr.
Lyndsay.

“ Considering how very rare a thing beauty, perfect beauty,
is, there certainly seems to have been rather a lavish expen-
diture of it on the huntsman's daughter and drover's wife.”
“ Colonel Delmour, don't you remember what the poet
says on that ?
“There's many a flower that's born to grow unseen,
And waste its beauty on the senseless air.""
“ However rare beauty may be," said Mr. Lyndsay, pass-
ing over Miss Pratt's quotation, “ 'your desire of confining it
to the higher orders is rather too arbitrary."
“ They certainly can better appreciate it,” returned Colonel
Delmour; "there is a refinement of taste requisite to admire
such beauty as that,” and he glanced from the Diana to Miss
St. Clair. “How could one of the canaille possibly compre-
hend the fine antique cast of those features, the classical con-
tour of the head, the swan-like throat, the inimitable mould
ing of the cheek! would not a pair of round white eyes, and
blowzy red cheeks, with a snub nose, and a mouth from ear
to ear, have been quite as well bestowed upon the drover ?”
“I dare say he could not talk so scientifically on the subject
as you do," said Mr. Lyndsay ; “but, for all that, he might
have been as fond of his wife, and as proud of her too, as
either you or I could have been."
“ Impossible—that is, supposing she had been of my own
rank and station-not Venus herself could have won me to a
· mésalliance.'"
“Suppose the huntsman's daughter had been as perfect in
mind and manner as in person
"The idea is absurd-the thing is impossible," interrupted
Colonel Delmour, impatiently.
“It is certainly difficult to conceive refinement of manners
in a person of low birth ; but why may not a noble mind be
conferred on a peasant as well as on a prince ?"
“What!" cried Colonel Delmour, indignantly,“ do you
really pretend to say that the offspring of a clown or a me-
chanic-animals who have walked the world in hob-nailed
shoes, or sat all their lives cross-legged with their noses
at a grinding-wheel, can possibly possess the same lofty
spirit as the descendants of heroes and statesmen? The very
thought of being so descended must elevate the mind, and
give it a conscious superiority over the low-born drudges of
the earth."
“Then you must feel yourself greatly superior in mind to
Virgil, Horace, Shakespeare, Milton, Spenser, and a long et
cctera of illustrious names down to the present day, who, if
not absolutely low-born, have yet no pretensions to high

birth. For my own part, I think it is rather humbling than
elevating to reflect on the titled insignificance of this very
family, who, though possessed of honours, wealth, and power,
for centuries, has never produced one man eminent for his
virtues or his talents, nor, if we may trust to painters, one
female celebrated for such beauty as this poor huntsman's
daughter."
"You see her as a goddess, remember," said Colonel Del-
mour, ironically ; “perhaps in her blue flannel “jupon,'
unsandalled feet, and kerchief, in a comely' cotton gown,
carrying a mess to the dogs, she would have had fewer at-
tractions even for your noble nature."
" There is a taste in moral as well as in corporeal beauty,"
said Mr. Lyndsay, “and I can love and admire both for their
own intrinsic merits, without the aid of ornament. You, Del-
mour, must have them in court dress, with stars and coronets;
but with beauty such as that,”—and his eye unconsciously
rested on Gertrude—“had the mind, principles, and manners
corresponded to it, I could have loved even Lizzie Lundie-
perhaps too well.”
“ Had the huntsman's daughter been an angel and a god-
dess in one,” replied Colonel Delmour, warmly, “I never
could have thought of her as my wife—there is degradation
in the very idea."
All this while, Miss Pratt had, as usual, been gabbling to
the rest of the party, in a manner which prevented their
hcaring or joining in this argument. Miss St. Clair, indeed,
had contrived to pick up a little of it, and warmly adopted
Colonel Delmour's sentiments on the subject.
“I wonder what became of Lizzie's family, for I think al-
ways I heard she had a daughter as great a beauty as herself
-I've a notion it was a daughter of hers -Mrs. St. Clair,
are you well enough ?—Bless my heart, she's going to faint!”
All crowded round Mrs. St. Člair, who seemed, indeed, on
the point of fainting-the windows were thrown open—water
was brought-smelling-bottles applied—till, at length, she re-
vived, and, with a faint smile, avowed that she had been in-
disposed for some days, and was subject to spasms of that
nature. Lord Rossville bent over his sister-in-law, as she
sat at the open window, with the utmost solicitude-he felt
really interested in her, for she had listened to him with the
most unceasing attention, and without once interrupting him
- a degree of deference he was little accustomed to in his own
family. At length she declared herself perfectly recovered,
and, supported by his lordship and her daughter, she retired
to her own apartment.
" That was an unlucky remark of yours, Colonel, about

low marriages," whispered Miss Pratt; "I really think it
was that overset her—though I suspect Lizzie Lundie had
something to do with it too; very likely some relationship
there, for you know the Blacks are not just at the top of the
tree,"—with a knowing wink; “that, and the smell of Lord
Rossville's boots and shoes together, was really enough to
overset her;" but Miss Pratt was now left to gabble to her-
self, for the rest of the party had dispersed.
CHAPTER IX.
The softness and suavity of Mrs. St. Clair's manners formed
so striking a contrast to the sharp gnat-like attacks of Miss
Pratt, that Lord Rossville became every day more attached
to his sister-in-law's company; and she soon found herself so
firmly fixed in his good graces, that she ventured to request
permission that she and her daughter might be allowed to
visit her relations, with whom she had hitherto only commu-
nicated by letter.
“Certainly, my dear madam,” replied the Earl ; "nothing
can be more proper and reasonable than that you should re-
cognise and visit the different members of your own family,
who, I am happy to think, are all persons of unblemished
reputation, and respectable stations in life, which respecta-
bility is in a fair way of being increased by votes which, I
understand, an uncle and brother of yours have lately acquired
in the county; and as there is every appearance of our
having a warmly-contested election shortly, their political
influence, if properly directed, cannot fail of proving highly
beneficial to them. I therefore give my unqualified assent as
to the propriety of your visiting your own family, as soon as
we can arrange the proper time, mode, and manner of doing
80; but, with regard to the daughter of the Honourable
Thomas St. Clair, I must candidly acknowledge to you, my dear
madam, I have not yet brought my mind to any fixed deter-
mination on that point. Your own good sense will naturally
point out to you the very peculiar situation in which she
stands. Miss St. Clair is at present to be viewed as the
heiress presumptive to the titles, honours, and estates of this
family; but, observe, although presumptive, she is by no
means heiress apparent--for there is a wide and important
distinction betwixt these apparent synonyms." —Here his
lordship entered into a most elaborate explanation of these
differences of distinction.-- And now, my dear madam, I am

sure you will agree with me, that, in a situation of such pecu.
liar delicacy, every step which Miss St. Clair takes ought to
be weighed with the utmost nicety and deliberation; since
what might be befitting the heiress presumptive might be
deemed derogatory to the heiress apparent—and what dignity
demands of the heiress apparent the world might censure as
an undue assumption of consequence in the heiress presump-
tive.”
Mrs. St. Clair, though choking with indignation at this
roundabout insinuation that her family was scarcely fit to be
associated with by her own daughter, yet repressed her in-
dignation; and, as she did not consider it of much conse-
quence that she should accompany her on her first visit, she
readily yielded the matter with a good grace. But no sooner
had she done so, than the Earl, as was often his custom, im-
mediately tacked about, and took the opposite side of the
argument. The result was, that Mrs. and Miss St. Clair
should immediately proceed to visit the respective members
of the Black family, and the Earl's travelling, chariot-and-
four, with all appliances to boot, was ordered out for the
occasion. It was with a thrill of delight Mrs. St. Clair took
her place in it, and drove off in all the éclat of rank and
state.
Fearful anticipations mingled with Mrs. St. Clair's natural
affection, as she thought of the meeting with her own family.
Its only members consisted of a brother, who, partly by in-
dustry, partly by good fortune, had become the proprietor of
a large tract of unimproved land in the neighbourhood—two
unmarried sisters residing in the county town, -and an old
uncle from the East Indies, a half-brother of her mother's,
reported to be enormously rich. When she had left home her
brother was a mere raw unformed lad; but he was now an
elderly man, the husband of a woman she had never seen, and
the father of a numerous family. After quitting the noble
domain of Rossville, the country gradually assumed a iess
picturesque appearance-rocks, woods, and rivers, now gave
way to arable land, well-fenced fields, and well-filled barn-
yards; while these, in turn, yielded to vast tracts of improve-
able land, thriving belts of young plantation, ring-stone dikes,
and drains in all directions.
It was in the midst of this scenery that Bellevue stood pre-
cminent. It was a showy, white-washed, winged house, situ-
ated on the top of the hill, commanding an extensive view of
“muirs and mosses many, 0,” with traces of cultivation in-
terspersed, and which by many was considered as a very fine,
and by all was styled a very commanding, prospect. A dazzling
white gate, with spruce canister lodge, opened upon a well-

43
gravelled avenue, which led to the mansion, surrounded by a
little smiling lawn, with a tuft of evergreens in the centre.
On one hand appeared a promising garden wall; on the other,
a set of commodious-looking farm offices—everything was in
the highest order—all bespoke the flourishing gentleman
farmer. The door was opened by a stout florid foot-boy, in
flaunting livery, whose yellow locks seemed to stiffen at sight
of the splendid equipage that met his view.
The interroga-
tories, however, at length recalled him to a sense of duty;
and upon the question being put for the third time, whether
his master or mistress were at home, he returned that cautious
answer which marks the wary, well-tutored though perplexed
menial, i. e. that he was not sure, but he would see. After
an interval of about five minutes, during which much opening
and shutting of doors was heard, and many a head was seen
peeping over blinds and from behind shutters, the prudent
Will returned with an invitation to the ladies to alight; and,
leading the way, he conducted to a well-furnished, but evi-
dently uninhabited drawing-room, where he left them, with
an assurance, that his mistress would be there in a minute.
Many minutes, however, elapsed, during which the visitors
were left to find amusement for themselves, which was no easy
task where the materials were wanting. In such circum-
stances, a fire is a never-failing resource Gif bad we can stir
it, if good we can enjoy it—but here was no fire, and the
bright handsome stove was only to be admired for itself, and
the profusion of white paper which filled it. The carpet
was covered, the chairs were in their wrappers, the screens
were in bags; even the chimney-piece, that refuge of the
weary, showed only two handsome girandoles. There were two
portraits, indeed, large as life, hanging on each side of the
fire-place, in all the rawness of bad painting, glaring in tints
which Time himself could never mellow. The one, it might
be presumed, was Mr. Black, in a bright blue coat, pure white
waistcoat, and drooping fall of Foyer's-looking neckcloth,
holding a glove, and looking very sensible. The other, it
might be inferred, was Mrs. Black, sitting under a tree, in a
yellow gown and ill put-on turban, smiling with all her might,
and both evidently bent upon putting all the expression they
possibly could into their faces, by way of getting a good
pennyworth for their money,
At length the door opened, and Mrs. Black, in propria per-
sonâ,' entered, followed by a train of daughters. She was
rather embonpoint,' with a fine healthy colour, clear blue
eyes, and an open good-humoured expression of countenance
--forming, altogether, what is expressively termed a comely
woman, which, if it mean something less than beauty, is often

more attractive. She had evidently been dressing for the
occasion, as her gown seemed scarcely yet out of the fold, but
looked like a thing apart from her, and had that inexpressible
air of constraint which gowns will have when gowns are made
things of primary importance.
Mrs. Black welcomed her guests in a manner which, if it
had nothing of the elegance of ton, was yet free from affecta-
tion or pretension. She expressed her regret, that Mr. Black
should be from home; but she had sent in search of him, and
hoped he would soon.cast up.' Mrs. St. Clair, resolving to be
delightful, sat with her sister-in-law's hand in her's, and,
with a face of the most affectionate interest, was presently
deep in inquiries as to the state of her family, the number of
her children, their ages, sexes, names, pursuits, and so forth.
The amount of the information she received was this :-Mrs.
Black was the mother of eleven children living, and two
dead ;-her eldest daughter (who had just gone to take a
walk) was going to be married, and her youngest to be weaned.
It was thought a very good marriage for Bell, as Major Wad-
dell had made a handsome fortune in the Company's service,
and was very well connected in the county, being cousin-
german to Sir William Waddell of Waddell Mains, and very
likely to succeed to him, if he was spared. He was also re-
lated to the Bogs of Boghall, and the present Boghall had
married a daughter of Lord Fairacre's, and their son was
going to stand for the county. Major Waddell, to be sure,
was a good deal older than Bell; but he had kept his health
well in India, and though not a beauty, was very well--at
least, he pleased Bell, and that was everything. Due con-
gratulations were here offered by Mrs. St. Clair, with the
customary remarks, of its being a pleasant and desirable
thing for the first of a family to form a respectable connection;
that any disparity of years was on the right side, &c. &c. &c.;
concluding with a request to be favoured with a sight of the
young people. Mrs. Black's eyes beamed delight as she
pulled the bell, and gave orders for the children to be
brought, observing, at the same time, that they were sad
romps, and seldom fit to be seen. Miss St. Clair, meanwhile,
was engaged with her cousins, pretty, good-natured looking
girls, one of whom talked much of balls, and officers, and
poetry; but as the children entered, she sighed, and said,
there was an end of all rational conversation.
Masters and Misses Black had all evidently been preparing
for exhibition. They were fine, stout, blooming, awkward
creatures, with shining faces, and straight-combed, though
rebellious-looking, hair, while a smart cap, red eyes, and
sour face, bespoke the sufferings of the baby. Altogether

they formed, what is politely called an uncommon fine family
-they all made bows and curtsies—walked with their toes in
- stood with their fingers in their mouths—and, in short,
were a very fine family. Of course, they were much com-
mended and caressed by their new relations, till the entrance
of Mr. Black turned the attention into another channel. Mr.
Black was the only one of the family on whom the phenome-
non of a chaise-and-four had produced no visible effect :-
he entered ill-dressed, overheated, and with a common, even
vulgar air—though, in reality, he was rather a good-looking
Mrs. St. Clair had expected something of a scene at
meeting with her brother; but he seemed to have no thoughts
of anything of the kind, for he received his sister with that
look and manner of plain, hearty welcome, which showed
that anything of fine feeling would be completely thrown
away. Yet his greeting was sufficiently affectionate in its
own blunt, homely kind.
“It is a long time since you and I have met, Sally,” said
he, as he seated himself beside his sister, with a child on
each knee; " but you have kept your looks well—to be sure,
you haven't had so large a share of the evils of life as I have
had," looking round with evident pride and exultation on
his offspring, and affecting to sigh at the same time. Mrs. St.
Clair shook her head, and sighed too; but her sigh was a
much better got-up sigh than her brother's—it said, or was in-
tended to say, “Heaven only knows what I have suffered for
that one!”
Mrs. Black seemed to understand it, for she said, with a
look of sympathy, -
“I'm sure an only child must be a great misfortune ; and
we have great reason to be thankful, Mr. Black, that so many
of ours have been spared.” Then beckoning one of her
daughters, she whispered some instructions to her, accom-
panied with a key. The young lady left the room, and in a
few minutes the yellow-haired laddie entered, bearing a
massive silver tray, conveying the richest of cakes, and the
strongest and sweetest of wines. As Miss St. Clair threw
back her bonnet to partake of the hospitalities, her uncle
regarded her with more earnestness than good-breeding, then
glanced all round on his own offspring.
“ I'm trying if I can make out a likeness betwixt your
daughter and my brats," said he to his sister ; “but I don't
think she has much of a Black face."
“She is thought to resemble her father's family more than
mine," replied Mrs. St. Clair, colouring deeply, and looking
rather displeased.
“ None of them that I have ever seen,” retnrned Mr.

Black ;-" her father, if I remember right, had light hair
and a flat face, and-
“ There is no end to arguing upon resemblances," inter-
rupted Mrs. St. Clair, rising hastily; "the general expression
is sometimes very strong, when every feature is different ;
and she was preparing to depart, when one of the children,
who was looking out at a window, exclaimed, “Here's Bell
and the Major !"-and to depart in the face of Bell and the
Major was declared to be impossible; so Mrs. St. Clair,
though fretting at the delay, was obliged to await the entrance
of the lovers.
Fortunately Miss Bell had no toilette duties to perform ;
for she was dressed for the Major in a fashionable gown made
by Miss Skrimpskirt, of Tattleton, from a pattern of Miss
Gorewell's, in Edinburgh, who had got it from Miss Fleece-
well of London, who had had hers direct from Madame Chef-
douvre, of Paris. Miss Bell, therefore, felt no disheartening
doubts as to her appearance ; but firmly relying on the just-
ness of her proportions, and the orthodox length of her waist,
and breadth of her shoulders, and strong in the consciousness
of being flounced and hemmed up to the knees, she boldly
entered, followed by her betrothed. Miss Isabella Black was
really a very pretty girl-she had a pretty figure, pretty
features, pretty hair, a pretty complexion, a pretty bonnet, a
pretty shawl, pretty boots, and a pretty watch. But over all
this prettiness was diffused an intolerable air of folly, affec-
tation, and conceit, which completely marred the effect of her
charms.
Major Waddell was a very passable sort of person for a
nabob ;-he had a dingy bronze complexion, tawny eyes,
tolerable teeth, and a long, wrinkled, smirking, baboonish
physiognomy.
“Why, Bell, we were afraid you had run away with the
Major," said Mr. Black, facetiously, addressing his daughter
on her entrance.
" That is a very odd speech, I think, papa, to one in my
situation," said Miss Bell, affecting to look much discon-
certed.
“ Come, come, here are no strangers, so there need be no
secrets. It is pretty well known that if you don't run away
with the Major, the Major will run away with you some of
these days."
Here Mr. Black laughed, and Mrs. Black laughed, and all
the Masters and Misses Black laughed loud and long,—while
in the general laugh the fair bride, as if overwhelmed by
confusion, took her cousin aside and whispered,
“ This is a very awkward scrape I am brought into by

47
papa's bluntness. It certainly was my intention to have
announced the matter to my aunt and you at a proper time,
but not just at present; so I must request as a particular
favour, that you will say nothing about it at Rossville—it is
so very unpleasant to be the talk of the whole county upon
an affair of this kind, that the Major and I had resolved
to have it kept as quiet as possible. It was only yesterday
he communicated it to Sir William Waddell, and he has not
yet mentioned it to Lord Fairacre, or any of his other
relations."
Mrs. St. Clair was too impatient to be gone, to allow any
further latitude for the lovers to show off, but was again
in the midst of leave-taking. Much was said about having a
longer visit—of taking a family dinner-of spending a few
days-of leaving Miss St. Clair to spend a little time and get
acquainted with her cousins; and Mrs. St. Clair could only
disengage herself from this well-meant hospitality, by pro-
mising to take the earliest opportunity of repeating her
visit. “I
trust I may be excused from returning this visit,”
said Miss Bell, with a look of modest importance, “as in my
situation I go nowhere at present."
Escorted by Mr. Black and the Major, and followed by the
whole family, Mrs. and Miss St. Clair resumed their places
in the carriage, and were soon driven beyond the precincts of
Bellevue. Their next destination was to the house of the
Miss Blacks, in the county town, and there they were accord-
ingly driven.
CHAPTER X.
It was with mingled emotions Mrs. St. Clair found herself at
the door of that mansion she had quitted thirty-three years
ago. It was the house in which she had first seen the light-
where her parents had dwelt—and where she had left them
surrounded by a numerous family—but all were gone save
the brother she had just seen, and two sisters, now its sole
tenants. Even the most artificial characters still retain some
natural feelings, and as Mrs. St. Clair crossed the threshold
of her once happy home, and the thoughts of the past
rushed over her, she exclaimed, with a burst of anguish,-
“Would to God I had never left it !" and, throwing herself
upon a seat, she wept without control.
There is something in real emotion, that always carries
conviction along with it. Although well accustomed to the
ebullitions of her mother's character, Miss St. Clair saw and

felt the depth of her present feelings, and sought by her
tender and affectionate sympathy to soften her sense of
sorrow. But, with a look and gesture expressive only of
abhorrence, her mother repelled her from her. At that
moment a lady approached, and, throwing herself into her
arms, Mrs. St. Clair sobbed in bitterness of spirit, while her
sister mingled her tears with hers. Miss Black was the first
to regain her composure, and she said in a voice, which,
though still tremulous with emotion, was yet soft and
sweet,
“I love those feelings, my dear Sarah, they are so natural.
You miss all those you left behind, and you are thinking
what a happier meeting this might have been, had it pleased
God to have spared them to us--but I trust there is a happy
meeting yet in store for us."
“Oh, no, no !" sobbed Mrs. St. Clair, almost convulsively,
as she leant her head on her sister's shoulder.
“My dear Sarah,” said Miss Black, in a tone of tender re-
proach, accompanied by an affectionate embrace ; but
come, let me take you to our poor Mary, who cannot go
to you."
Mrs. St. Clair raised her head, and made an effort to
subdue her emotion, as she suffered herself to be led to the
apartment where her youngest and favourite sister was.
When she had left home, she had left her a lovely
romping child of five years old, with laughing blue eyes and
curling flaxen hair ; and this image of infant beauty she had
ever treasured in her memory, though reason had told her
the reality had long since fled. But, alas! reason can but
imperfectly picture to us the slow and silent ravages of time-
and at sight of her sister Mrs. St. Clair felt as much shocked
as though the change had been the metamorphose of an
instant, instead of the gradual progress of years of suffering
and decay. Imagination, indeed, could not have pictured to
itself aught so affecting as the contrast thus presented by a
glance of the mind. Mrs. St. Clair thought only of the gay,
rosy, frolicsome creature, whose fairy form seemed even yet
to bound before her eyes, or hang round her neck in infantine
fondness—and on that self-same spot where last she had
parted from her, she now beheld her a monument of prema-
ture decay-pale, motionless, and paralytic. For a moment
she shrunk from the half living, half beatified, looking being,
with that instinctive horror with which the worldly mind
recoils from all that reminds it of perishable nature. A faint
streak of red tinged her sister's sallow cheek, and a tear
glistened in her soft blue eye, and her heart seemed to swell
-perhaps with some almost forgotten feelings of humiliation

THE INHERITANCE.
49
at her own infirmities. But when Mrs. St. Clair again
looked, the slight hectic had fled, the tear was dried, and the
sigh was checked.
“ God's will be done, my sister !" said she, with a look and
accent of meek and holy resignation. Mrs. St. Clair could not
speak, but she threw herself on her sister's neck and wept.
Gertrude, meanwhile, had stood aloof-her heart oppressed
with sorrow, and her eyes filled with tears, as she contrasted
her mother's feelings towards her sisters with those she had
testified towards her; and the painful conviction that she was
not beloved, forced itself upon her in all the bitterness such
a discovery was calculated to excite. At length the agitation
of the meeting between the sisters began to subside, and Miss
Black, approaching her niece, tenderly embraced her, and led
her to her sister. " Here is a stranger who has been too long
overlooked,” said she; “but once seen she will not be soon
forgotten;" and she gently untied her bonnet, and looked on
her with eyes of delighted affection. Her aunt Mary sweetly
welcomed her, and also regarded her with an expression of
love and tenderness, such as Gertrude felt she never had
read even in her mother's eye.
Mrs. St. Clair seemed little gratified by the fondness her
sisters testified for her daughter. She remained silent and
abstracted, with her eyes fixed on the memorials of former
days; for everything remained in the same primitive order
as when she had left them; and everything told some long-
forgotten tale, or roused some sad though slumbering recol-
lection. She fixed her eyes on some foreign shells which
decorated the old-fashioned chimney-piece, and what a
train of associations did these mute and insignificant objects
conjure up! They were the gift of one who had loved her
in early youth, and who had brought them to her (all that
he had to bring) from afar—and dearly had she prized them,
for then she had loved the giver. But he was a poor and
friendless orphan boy-and she became the wife of an earl's
" You see much to remind you of the days that are gone,
my dear sister,” said Miss Black, tenderly; “ but when the
first impression is over, you will love to look upon those
relics, as we do, for the sake of those who loved us."
“Never! ah, never !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, starting
up, and going to the window ; "everything here is torture to
me-the
very
air suffocates me."
She threw open the window and leaned out, but it was only
to behold other mementos of days past and gone. She
looked upon the little garden, the scene of many a childish
gambol-it lay in the full blaze of a meridian sun, and all
son.

THE INHERITANCE,
was fair and calm. An old laburnum tree still hung its
golden blossoms over a rustic seat at one corner of the
garden, and the time since she had sat there and decked her-
self in its fantastic garlands seemed as nothing. She remem-
bered, too, when, after a long childish illness, her father had
carried her in his arms to the garden, with what ecstacy she
had breathed the fresh air, and looked on the blue sky, and
plucked the gaudiest flowers. “It was on such a day as
this,” thought she; “the air is as fresh now as it was then-
the sky is as fair—the flowers as sweet; but my father-ah!
were he still alive, would he thank Heaven now as he did
then, for having preserved his child !”
And again the bitter drops fell from her eyes as she turned
sickening from the view. The chord of feeling had been
stretched too high to regain its ordinary pitch without an
effort; it is sometimes easier to break the chain than to loosen
it. Mrs. St. Clair felt her mind untuned for ordinary com-
muning, and she, therefore, took an abrupt leave of her
sisters, with a promise of returning soon when her nerves
should be stronger. Hurrying through the crowd collected
around the splendid equipage, she threw herself into it as if
afraid of being recognised, and called impatiently to her
daughter to follow.
The postilions cracked their whips,
the crowd fell back, and the proud pageant rattled and glit-
tered along till lost to the gaze of the envying and admiring
throng.
CHAPTER XI.
Mrs. St. CLAIR and her daughter proceeded for some time
in profound silence. The former seemed plunged in pain-
ful meditation, the latter felt grieved and mortified at her
mother's caprice and unkindness to her. The first thing
which roused Mrs. St. Clair was the view of Rossville Castle,
rising proudly above the woods which embosomed it—and,
as she looked, gradually her brow cleared, her eye bright-
ened, and her countenance regained its usual expression.
“Gertrude, my love,” said she, taking her daughter's
hand, “I have almost forgotten you to-day. But your own
heart will enable you to conceive what mine must have suf-
fered ;” and she sighed deeply.
“Yes,” answered Miss St. Clair, in some agitation, “I
can conceive that
you
have felt much, but I cannot conceive
why-oh! mamma, what had I done, that you should have
shook me from you like a venomous reptile ?"

51
“My dear Gertrude! what an idea! that is the mere coin-
age of your brain. How can you allow yourself to be so
carried away by your imagination ? Come, my dear, let us
have no more such foolish fancies. Strange, indeed, it would
be,”. continued she, as the park gate was thrown open to
receive them ; “in any one to cast off like a reptile the fair
heiress of this princely domain."
But however strange her daughter felt, it was so, and she
remained silent. Mrs. St. Clair resumed.
Apropos, Gertrude, when you are lady of Rossville, you
must build me little tiny cottage on yon lovely green bank,
where I may live quietly as a humble cottager, while you
play the great lady. Come, promise me, Gertrude, that I
shall have a croft from you—a butt and a ben—a cow's grass
and a kail-yard."
There was something so forced and unnatural in her
mother's sudden gaiety, that Miss St. Clair, accustomed as
she was to all the inequalities of her temper, felt almost
frightened at it, and she was at a loss how to reply.

dependence for my old age ? Perhaps you are right to bo

“Oh, mamma!” exclaimed Miss St. Clair, bursting into
tears, do not kill me with such cruel words."
" Is it so cruel, then, in a mother to crave a pittance from
the bounty of her child ?"
" It is cruel to doubt that I would give you all-yes, were
all this mine to-morrow, I could not be more mistress of it
than
you
shall be.”
you think at present, Gertrude, but you know not as
I do the mutability of the human mind. You will form other
ties—other connections—you will marry, and your mother
will be forgotten-perhaps forsaken-you will marry," cried
she with increased violence, “you will marry, and I shall be
left to starve-you will fall a prey to the artifices of a
Colonel Delmour-& needy, desperate spendthrift. I see
already he is paying court to the future heiress, and, once
the wife of that designing, extravagant man, you will have
nothing to bestow."
Shocked and amazed at her mother's violence, Miss St.
Clair sought to tranquillise her by assurances that she was
mistaken in supposing Colonel Delmour had any such views,
when Mrs. St. Clair interrupted her,—“Promise me, then,
that
you will never become his wife."
There is always something revolting to an open ingenuous

mind in being fettered by promises; but there was something
more than even that natural repugnance to make Gertrude
shrink from thus binding herself to her mother's will, and
she remained silent; but the deep blush that burned on her
cheek spoke more eloquently than words. Mrs. St. Clair
regarded her with a piercing look—then exclaimed, in a
transport of anger, “ And is it even so—and all that I have
done and suffered is—" then, suddenly stopping, she
added, in a milder tone; “Gertrude, my wish is to save you
from the dangers with which you are already surrounded-
promise me, at least, that you will not marry until you have
attained the age of twenty-one-that you will never marry
without my consent, and until you have provided for my old
age.”
“Mamma," said Miss St. Clair, with a calmness and self-
possession which bespoke her determination, “I here pro-
mise that I will not marry without your consent before the
age of twenty-one, and until I have provided for you as
becomes my mother ; more I cannot-I dare not-I will not
promise."
“ Then with that I must be satisfied," said Mrs. St. Clair,
as the carriage stopped at the Castle door; and having
alighted, she entered the house, while her daughter stood
some minutes on the lawn, inhaling the freshness of a west
wind, laden with the sweets of opening buds and blos-
“Ah!" thought Gertrude, “how willingly would I re-
nounce all the pomp of greatness, to dwell here in lowly
affection with one who would love me, and whom I could love
in return! How strange that I, who could cherish the very
worm that crawls beneath my foot, have no one being to
whom I can utter the thoughts of my heart—no one on whom
I can bestow its best affections !” She raised her eyes,
swimming in tears, to heaven, but it was in the poetical
enthusiasm of feeling, not in the calm spirit of devotion.
She was suddenly roused by hearing some one approach, and
presently Colonel Delmour, forcing his way through some
wild tangled bushes, hastened towards her with an appear-
ance of the greatest delight. At sight of him, the thoughts
of her mother's warning rushed to her recollection—the dis-
like she had expressed—the suspicions she harboured-the
promise she would have exacted—all seemed to give him a
sort of inexplicable interest in her eyes. She coloured
deeply, and the consciousness she had done so added to her
confusion.
“I have to apologise to you,” said Colonel Delmour, “for
thus literally forcing my way to you. Lyndsay and I were
soms.

practising archery when I descried you; to see you, and not
to fly to you, was impossible, had Briareus himself opposed
my passage; so, leaving Edward master of the field, I winged
my way to you like one of my own arrows—but I fear I
startled you?"
Miss St. Clair felt as though she were acting in direct dis-
obedience to her mother, in thus meeting, even accidentally,
with the man she had just heard denounced by her. In great
embarrassment she begged he would resume his exercise, and
she was moving away, when Colonel Delmour caught her hand,
and in a low tone said,
“Do not stir from hence, unless you wish to encounter
Miss Pratt's observations ; she is beating about here ; I saw
her as I came along, but I trust she will lose scent; do
remain till that danger is past.”
Almost equally averse to encounter Miss Pratt at any time,
but more particularly at present, she suffered Colonel Del-
mour to seat her on a little mossy knoll, and throwing himself
on the grass at her feet-
“Be this your throne, and behold your subject,” said he,
in a half serious, half sportive tone.
Miss St. Clair tried to reply in a strain of badinage, but
the words died on her lips, and, colouring_still more deeply,
she remained silent. At that moment Mr. Lyndsay appeared,
but ere he had time to address her, the shrill voice of Miss
Pratt was heard, and presently she broke in.
“Ah, ha! so you're all here !-Upon my word, here's a
meeting of friends. It puts me in mind of a scene in a play,
where all the lovers meet to run away with pretty Mistress
Anne Page, and the one cries mum, and the other cries
budget.”
“ Two excellent words," said Colonel Delmour, looking
much provoked ; "of course you understand their meaning
-be silent and be gone.”
“Two very impertinent words, in my opinion,” said Miss
Pratt, seating herself beside Gertrude ; and, to tell
you
the
truth, I've no great notion of your mums. There's a family in
this county all so tongue-tied, that Anthony Whyte calls their
house the Mummery-and by-the-bye, Mr. Edward, I really
think you may cry mum any day; you're grown very silent of
late."
“A proof I am growing wiser, I suppose," answered he,
laughingly, "according to some great authority, who, I think,
says most men speak from not knowing how to be silent."
“ The saying of some dull blockhead, I suspect,” said
Colonel Delmour, still evidently out of humour.
“ Indeed, I think so too, Colonel," cried Miss Pratt; "any-

body can hold their tongue, but it's not everybody that can
speak."
“Not everybody that ought to speak, or, at least, ought to
be listened to,” said Colonel Delmour, contemptuously turn-
ing from her, and addressing some words in French in a low
tone to Gertrude, while Miss Pratt gabbled on-
“ Bless me! what a tear I've got in my gown! there's
really an ill luck attends this gown-I never have it on with-
out its meeting with some accident, that's all I've got by
hunting after you youngsters;" and in the twinkling of an eye,
her huswife was out, her thimble on her finger, and her
needle flying through all the intricacies of a very bad cross
tear.
“What's this we were talking about? O! about people
holding their tongues—I really wish these birds would hold
theirs, for I'm periectly dieved with their chattering—sh, sh,”
shaking her parasol at a goldfinch. “I really think young
people should be made to hold their tongues, and only speak
when they're spoken to.-Was that a fish that leaped in the
water just now?—what a pity but one of you had had a
fishing-rod in your hands instead of these senseless bows and
arrows; it would have been some amusement to have seen
you hook a nice three pound weight caller trout :-and really
old people should be cautious of speaking—they're sometimes
rather slow, you know—not but what I can listen to anybody.
-Bless me! how the wind's blowing these blossoms about
I'm like to be blinded with them."
“I can tell you one thing, my dear," whispered she to
Gertrude, “ that mum should be the watchword here to-day;
a certain
person,"
," with a wink at Colonel Delmour, “is but a
younger brother, and not the thing. He can be very pleasant
when
he pleases, but take my word for it he's not to ride the
ford upon :—but, bless me, I had no notion it was so late, and
I've a bit of lace to run upon my gown before dinner !" and
away ran Miss Pratt to her toilette, while Gertrude retired to
her chamber, to ruminate on the events of the day.
CHAPTER XII.
Miss St. CLAIR certainly could not help wishing that she
had not been forbidden to love her cousin ; for, although he
had not absolutely declare 1 himself her lover, he had said
more than enough to conrine her that he was deeply in love,
and that the happiness o his life hung upon her decision.

When she thought of her mother's prejudice against him, so
unjust, so unaccountable, it seemed next to impossible for her
to remain in a state of indecision. She must either adopt
her mother's sentiments, and hate, fly, abjure him; or she
must yield to her own inclinations, and listen to him—look on
him, and love him. In this state of mental embarrassment,
it was impossible for any one so ingenuous to conceal what
was passing in her mind. But those who were most interested
in observing her construed her behaviour, each according to
their own wishes. In her constrained manner and averted
eyes, whenever Colonel Delmour addressed her, Mrs. St.
Clair flattered herself she saw symptoms of that distrust and
dislike she had endeavoured to inculcate ; while he for the
present felt satisfied in the consciousness that he was at least
not an object of indifference.
But it was impossible for any ruminations to be carried on
long in the presence of Miss Pratt, whose own never lasted
longer than till she had made herself mistress of the dresses
of the company, or the dishes on the table. Having finished
her scrutiny of the former, she addressed Mrs. St. Clair :
“ You were very soon home to-day, I think ; you must
really bave paid fashionable visits to your friends—to be sure,
your sister's is not a house to stay long in. Poor Miss Mary,
what a pretty creature she was once, and as merry as a grig;
but she has taken rather a religious turn now—to be sure,
when people have not the use of their legs, what can they
do ?-I'm sure we should be thankful that have all our
faculties."
“ Except the faculty of being religious," said Mr. Lyndsay
with a smile.
“A certain degree of religion I think extremely proper,"
said Miss Pratt, in a by-way of serious manner; “but I'm
just afraid it's rather overdone ; not that I mean to say any-
thing against the Miss Blacks, for I assure you I have a very
high respect for them ;--and old Mr. Ramsay how did you
find him?-in a tolerable tune I hope ?”
“I was afraid of trespassing too far on Lord Rossville's
goodness, by detaining his carriage and servants, and there-
fore delayed visiting my uncle till another opportunity.”
"That was being extremely considerate, indeed," began his
Lordship, but, as usual, was cut short by Miss Pratt.
“Bless me what's the use of carriages and servants but
to wait? If you had played your cards well, you would have
gone first to your uncle—an std man in a nightcap, worth
good seventy thousand pound, and as cross as two sticks, is
not to be sneezed at, as Anthony Whyte says; but there's
the gong-O, Lord Rossville, I wish you would really get a
bell, for I declare there's no hearing one's self speak for that

war,"
gong-or what would you think of a trumpet ? Bells and
gongs are grown so common, that Anthony Whyte's going to
get a trumpet.”
“ Being already provided with a trumpeter, it is quite pro-
per that Mr. Whyte should have a trumpet,” said Colonel
Delmour.
“ Considering with what deadly intentions we assemble at
the dinner-table,” said Mr. Lyndsay, “I really think a war-
like instrument a much more appropriate symbol than a
peaceful, fasting, matin-sounding bell; indeed, the organ of
destructiveness is always so strong with me at this hour, and
I feel so much of the fee, fa, fum, about me, that I can scarcely
ask
you to trust yourself with me,” and he good-humouredly
gave his arm to Miss Pratt, as she was pattering away to the
dining-room, with rather a discomfited look, by herself ;
“and now for the pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious
-as the party seated themselves at the splendid board.
But Miss Pratt's mortification never could be made by any
possible means to endure much longer than the shock of a
shower-bath, and by the time the dishes were uncovered,
Richard was himself again.
“ Colonel Delmour, what's that before you? I think it
looks like fricasséed chicken; I'll thank you for some of it ;”
and Colonel Delmour, with the most indifferent air as to
Miss Pratt's wants, and talking all the while to Miss St.
Clair, sent her a part which did not suit her taste.
“ Just take that back," said she to the servant, “ with my
compliments to Colonel Delmour, and I'll be obliged to him
for a wing. Colonel, don't you know it's the fashion now,
when you help game or poultry, to ask, Pray do you run or
fly? meaning, do you choose leg or wing. There was a good
scene at Anthony Whyte's; one day fat Lady Puffendorf was
there-you know she's so asthmatic she can hardly walk-s0
when she chose chicken, “pray, ma'am,' says Anthony, 'do
you run or fly?' Of course a fine titter ran round the com-
pany. Lord Rossville, did you hear that ? Colonel Del-
mour, remember I fly."
“I shall have great pleasure in assisting your flight,” said
he, with an ironical smile; “pray when may we expect to
see Miss Pratt take wing?"
“Is that that you may have a shot at me with your bow
and arrow? I thought, indeed, you looked as if you were
rather bent upon wounding hearts than harts to-day; you
understand the difference, don't you, Miss St. Clair ?” who
only coloured a reply, and even Colonel Delmour seemed
disconcerted. "Well, never mind, mum's the word, you
know," with a provoking wink.; “ only, I advise all young
ladies who value their hearts to cry budget to gentlemen with

bows and arrows." Lord Rossville's ideas, fortunately, never
could keep pace with Miss Pratt's tongue-he had now only
overtaken her at the " run and fly," and was busy preparing,
with all the powers of his mind, a caveat against the use of
cant terms—to begin with a quotation from Lord Chester-
field, and to be followed up by a full declaration of his own
sentiments on the subject. In short, his mode of proceeding
was something like bringing out a field piece to knock down
a fly, which, in the meantime, had perched itself on the very
mouth of the cannon; unconscious of the formidable artillery
that was preparing against her, she buzzed away.
“Let me help you to some asparagrass, my Lord;" help-
ing herself largely in the meantime ; very fine it is, though
rather out of season now; it has been long over at Whyte
Hall. But who can help asparagrass with asparagrass-tongs?
Anthony Whyte says, if ever he's prevailed upon to go into
Parliament, it will be for the sole purpose of bringing in
three bills for the relief of the rich. One of them is to be
an act for the suppression of asparagrass-tongs; another is to
make it felony for a cook to twist the legs of game, or force
a turkey to carry its head under its wing; and a third
is-
But here Lord Rossville's indignation got the better of his
good-breeding, and even overcame the more tardy operations
of his mind ; and before Anthony Whyte's third bill could be
brought forward, he exclaimed, " Mr. Anthony Whyte bring
bills into Parliament ! - Pray, Miss Pratt, have you any
authority for supposing, or insinuating, that Mr. Whyte has
the most distant shadow of an idea of attempting to procure
a seat in Parliament ? If he has, I can only say I have been
most grossly misinformed; if he has not, it is highly im-
proper
in you, or in any of his relations or friends, who the
world will naturally conclude are in his confidence, to start
such a supposition ;-—it is a serious, a very serious matter to
tamper with a gentleman's name in politics, more particularly
in the troublesome and factious times in which we live."
Even Miss Pratt was for an instant discomfited by the solemn
indignation of this address; but she quickly rallied, and
whispering to Mr. Lyndsay, “He's very bilious to-day, his
eyes are like boiled gooseberries, honest man !". She re-
sumed, " Bless me, Lord Rossville, one would think I had
spoken high treason, but I was only joking ; Mr. Whyte, I
can assure you, has too much good sense to think of going
into Parliament; if he had had a mind that way he might
have been in long ago; I'm told, from pretty good authority,
he might carry the county any day he liked."
Here the Earl absolutely gasped in the attempt to bring up

words long and strong enough to immolate the presumption
of Miss Pratt and Anthony Whyte. “I can assure you,
both Lord Punmedown and Sir Thomas Turnabout spoke
seriously to Mr. Whyte about it some time ago ; · Anthony,'
says my Lord, 'if you wish to sit, you've only to stand.'
Nothing could be stronger than that, you know. Faith, my
Lord,' says he, 'I believe I would have to lie in the first
place.' Very good, wasn't it? Anthony's always ready with
his answer; I assure you, if he was in Parliament he would
keep his own.”
"Is there anybody talked of in opposition to Robert ?”
asked Colonel Delmour, as if he had not even deigned to
hear Miss Pratt—"apropos, I had a letter from him this
morning."
“ Indeed I” exclaimed the Earl with great earnestness.
“I am rather surprised that such a piece of information
should have been only communicated to me in this accidental
manner-I have been anxiously looking for letters from Mr.
Delmour for some days—what does he say with regard to
the sitting of Parliament, and does he point at any probable
time for coming north ?"
“I merely glanced at his letter,” answered Colonel Del.
mour, with an air of indifference; "it seemed filled as usual
with politics, and I am no politician."
“I am not so sure about that,” said Miss Pratt in an under
tone, and with a most provoking significant look.
“ But you shall hear what he says-Smith," turning to
his servant, “you will find some letters upon the writing-
table in my dressing-room, bring them here."
“I hope you don't leave your love-letters lying about that
way, Colonel ?” cried the incorrigible Pratt. "I assure you,
if I was a young lady, I would take care how I corresponded
with you-you're not like Anthony Whyte, who keeps all his
letters like grim death."
The letters were brought, and Colonel Delmour, taking his
brother's from amongst them, glanced his eye over it, and read
in a skimming manner—"Animated and protracted debate-
admirable speech_legs two hours and a quarter-immense
applause-197 of majority-glorious result-opposition fairly
discomfited," &c. &c. ; he then read aloud-
“Pray inform the Earl there is no longer a doubt as to the
dissolution of Parliament next session; we must therefore pre-
pare to take the field immediately. Lord P. and Sir J. T.
intend to oppose us, I understand, and to bring forward some
tool of their own, but I have little fear as to the result. I
now only wait the passing of the road bill, and the discussion
on the resumption of cash payments, to be off for Scotland ;

am sure-
my uncle may, therefore, expect me in the course of a few
days, when I trust we shall be able to make a tolerable
muster. P.S.-I see a Major Waddell has lodged claim for
enrolment; do you know anything of him ?”
“Major Waddell !” repeated the Earl, putting his hand to
his forehead in a musing attitude, as if endeavouring to recol-
lect him.
“Major Waddell !” said Mrs. St. Clair, in her softest
manner, “is a gentleman of large fortune, lately returned
from India-heir, I understand to Sir William Waddell, and
upon the point of marriage with a niece of mine-his vote, I
Luckily, before Mrs. St. Clair could commit
herself and Major Waddell's vote, Miss Pratt dashed in-
Aye ! Miss Bell Black going to be married to Major Wad-
delli 'Pon my word, she has fallen upon her feet—that will
be a disappointment to many a one ; for I assure you the
Major's a prize; and I know three ladies he was supposed to
be looking after-he even went so far as to present one of
them with a very handsome Paradise plume—that I know to
be a fact, for I was staying in the house at the time, and
there was a great debate whether she should have accepted
it before he had made his proposals.-Aye! I was told that
Miss Bell had said lately in a company, that she never would
marry any man who couldn't give her silver tureens and
corners-
He's very well connected, too-Let me see, his
mother was a Bogg, and his father a Waddell of the Waddell
Mains family—so he has good blood both ways."
All this was very agreeable to Mrs. St. Clair-it was
giving consequence to her family, which was an advantage to
herself. Miss Pratt's pribble prabble was, therefore, music
to her ear, and while she gave her whole attention to that,
Colonel Delmour contrived to render his conversation no
less interesting to her daughter, whose deliberations, like
Othello's doubts, were gradually assuming a more decided
form. For in love, as in jealousy, it will commonly be found,
that " to be once in doubt is once to be resolved."
As the ladies rose from table, Lord Rossville, who had evi-
dently been struggling for some time to give utterance to
some exquisite idea, called Miss Pratt, just as she had reached
the door :--they all stopped.
“Miss Pratt," said his Lordship, making an effort to subdue
iny appearance of risibility, “Miss Pratt, I think your friend
who received the present of a plume from Major Waddell
will have no great cause to plume herself upon that—as, from
your account, it can no longer be a feather in her cap."
The Earl was two much elated with this sally to think of

Lord Chesterfield, and he indulged himself in a laugh tole-
rably loud and intolerably long.
“Ha! ha! ha! very good, indeed !” cried Miss Pratt. “I
must let Anthony Whyte and Lord Punmedown hear that
- very well indeed !--Poor Miss Kitty Fancyflame, as you
say, it will be no great feather in her cap now, poor soul! ha!
ha! ha! Lady Betty, did you hear that ?" then, pinching Ger-
trude's arm, ehe whispered, “ As Anthony Whyte says, it's
a serious matter when Lord Rossville makes a joke-honest
man-ha! ha! ha l-very fair indeed.” And Miss Pratt kept
up a running laugh all the way to the drawing-room.
CHAPTER XII.
The expected dissolution of Parliament was all in favour of
the growing attachment of the cousins. Gertrude, indeed,
tried, or thought she tried, to avoid receiving the attentions
of Colonel Delmour; but in the thousand minute and
almost imperceptible opportunities which are for ever occur-
ring where people dwell under the same roof, he found many
occasions of insinuating the ardour and sincerity of his pas-
sion, yet in a manner so refined and unobtrusive, that it
would have seemed downright prudery to have disclaimed his
attentions.
Lord Rossville was, or, what was the same thing, fancied
he was, so overwhelmed with business, that, contrary to his
usual practice, he now always retired immediately after tea
to his study, there to con over the map and count over the
roll of the county, and to frame the model of a circular
letter, which was to surpass all the circular letters that ever
had issued from a circular head.
Mrs. St. Clair was busy too-she had begun to canvass with
her brother and her uncle, to bespeak their votes, and had
written to offer a visit to the latter the following day, by the
Earl's desire. Lady Betty sat, as usual, at her little table,
with her rug, her novel, and her fat favourite. Miss Pratt
gabbled and knotted. Mr. Lyndsay read. Colonel Delmour
and Ge
de, alone, seemed unoccupied, but “how various
their employments whom the world deems idle.”—“You are
in an uncommon quiescent state to-night, Delmour," said Mr.
Lyndsay, closing his book and rising— Neither music, nor
billiards, nor ennui—most wonderfull"
“Etre avec les gens qz'on aime, cela suffit; rêver, leur

7
parler, leur parler point, auprès d'eux tout est egal,” replied
he, casting a look towards Gertrude, but affecting to address
Miss Pratt—"Is it not so, Miss Pratt ?”
“To tell you the truth, Colonel,” answered she with some
asperity, "when people speak French to me, I always lay it
down as a rule, that they're speaking nonsense - I'm
there's words enough in plain English to say all that any-
body has to say.'
"Ah! but they are too plain—that is precisely my objec-
tion to them, for you, I am sure, are aware,” and again he
stole a glance at Miss St. Clair, “combien de choses qu'on
n'aperçoit que par sentiment, et dont il est impossible de
rendre raison !' now, the French is the language of sentiment
—the Euglish of reason-consequently it is most unreason-
able in you, my dear Miss Pratt, to insist upon my expressing
my sentiments in a plain reasonable manner-but come, since
you profess to be insensible to sentiment, try whether you
cannot prevail upon Miss St. Clair to give us some music."
" Music !" reiterated Miss Pratt; “fiddlesticks! for any
sake, let us have one night of peace and rest—for I declare
Lord Rossville makes a perfect toil of music-but, indeed,
it's the same everywhere now there's not a house you go
into but some of the family are musical. I know one family
where there's five grown-up daughters that all play upon the
harp, and such a tuning, and stringing, and thrumming, goes
on, that I declare I get perfectly stupid. Not only that, but,
as Anthony Whyte says, you used to be aware of your danger
when you saw a piano or a fiddle in a house ; but now you
have music in all shapes, and such contrivances !-there's
musical glasses, and musical clocks, and musical snuff-boxes,
and now they've got musical work-boxes.-The t'other day,
when I was at Lady Restall's, I happened to want a thread in
a hurry, and was flying to her work-box for it-Stop, stop,
says she, and I'll give you something better than a thread;
so she locks up her box and sets it a-going, and, to be sure,
thought it never would have done-tune after tune—and 'Isn't
that a lovely waltz,' says she, “and isn't that a sweet quadrille !!
-Thinks I, my friend, if you was mine, I would soon stop
your mouth, and make you mind your own business."
“But I hope you got your thread ?” inquired Lady Betty.
“ Yes, yes, I got my thread at last, but isn't it a hard case
that one can't get a black silk thread, if it was to save their
life, without getting half a dozen tunes into the bargain ?
But that's not the most ridiculous part; for, says she, I've
commissioned a walking-cane for my Lord from Paris, (you
know Lord Restall can't walk the length of his toe without a
stick,) and it is to play three waltzes, two quadrilles, a horn-

pipe, and the Grand Turk's March-it will be such an amuse-
ment, says she, when he's walking with his friends, to set his
stick a-going.—Thinks I, he'll be clever if ever he sets it a-
going about my ears. Miss St. Clair, my dear, have you no
nice, nacky, little handywork, that you could be doing at,
while we sit and chat?"
“That is a proper reproof for my idleness," said Gertrude,
rising to fetch her work.
"How I detest the stupid vulgar industry of working
ladies,” said Colonel Delmour; "come, let me lead you to
the music-room," and he took her hand.
“What are you going to play?" asked Lady Betty.
“Tibbie Fowler," answered Miss Pratt.—"Miss Št. Clair,
my dear, did you ever hear Tibbie Fowler ?” and, in her
cracked voice, she struck up that celebrated ditty. Colonel
Delmour, with an expression of disgust, immediately hurried
Miss St. Clair to the adjoining room, leaving Miss Pratt to
carol away to Lady Betty and fat Flora.
Colonel Delmour was passionately fond of music, and sang
with much taste and expression ; he had hitherto, in the
various flirtations in which he had been engaged, found music
a most useful auxiliary, and by much the safest, as well as
the most elegant, medium for communicating his passion. If
the fair one proved propitious, what had been sung could
easily be said ; if the contrary, whatever her private thoughts
might be, she could not accuse him of more than singing a
song. It was, therefore, an invariable rule with Colonel
Delmour to use other men's verse, as well as other men's
prose, instead of his own. For similar reasons, he also pro-
ferred declaring his passion either in French or Italian; and
having read all the lighter works in these languages, and
being gifted with a good memory and a ready wit, he was
seldom at a loss for expressions suited to each particular case.
Suddenly Miss Pratt burst in with “Wisht, wisht—there's
somebody coming that will make us all change our note, I'm
thinking;” and while she spoke, a spattered chaise-and-four,
with horses in a foam, drove up, which was recognised by its
bearings to be that of Mr. Delmour. All was bustle and
sensation—the family, with the exception of Lord Rossville,
had dropped in one by one to the music-room, where Mr.
Delmour was ushered in. He was what many would have
called a very fine-looking man—tall and straight, with hand-
some regular features, although somewhat resembling Lord
Rossville both in person and manners. He paid his compli-
ments rather with the well-bred formality of the old school
than with the easy disengaged air of a man of fashion, and
totally devoid of that air of empressement' towards Miss St.

Clair which had 'marked the attentions of his brother from
their first meeting. In fact, Mr. Delmour seemed little en-
grossed with any of the party, but looked round as if in
search of a far more interesting object, and then anxiously
inquired where Lord Rossville was. But ere an answer could
be returned the Earl himself entered, and mutual pleasure
was testified by the uncle and nephew at sight of each other.
“ Although, upon ordinary occasions, I confess I am no
friend to what are termed unexpected pleasures,” said his
Lordship, “yet, in the present instance, my dear Robert, I
own I do not feel my pleasure at your arrival at all diminished
by the unexpectedness of your appearance. At the same
time, it would not have been amiss, perhaps, to have apprised
me of your intention at this important time.”
“Impossible !” replied Mr. Delmour eagerly; “ quite im-
possible! In fact, I set off the instant the
House rose, which
was on Friday morning at half-past five, after a most interest-
ing debate on the Paper Currency, which, I am happy to tell
you, we carried by a majority of eighty-five."
“Bravo !” exclaimed the Earl.-" And our Road Bill ?"
“ Is passed—but how stands the county ?— Have you felt
its pulse at all ?-I understand a brisk canvass has commenced
in a certain quarter. I got a hint of that from Lord Wishton,
which, in fact, induced me to set off without a moment's
delay.
“You acted wisely and well,” said the Earl; “delays are
always dangerous—more especially upon occasions such as the
present."
“It's high time you had begun to canvass, if you expect to
succeed in your election, I can tell you," interposed Miss
Pratt, with one of her sharp pithy glances at Colonel Delmour
and Gertrude, who kept a little apart; and to judge by the
blush and the smile which occasionally flitted over her beau-
tiful features, as she sometimes bent her head to his whispers,
the conversation was of rather a more interesting nature than
what was carrying on between the uncle and nephew.
Miss Pratt's remark did not hit either of them, and the
latter resumed—“I am told the opposite party give out they
can already reckon upon twenty-nine votes—that, I suspect,
is a ruse de guerre ; but still it shows the necessity of our
taking the field immediately."
“Precisely my own sentiments !” exclaimed Lord Rossville
with delight;
as you justly observe, there is not a moment
to lose."
“Something might yet be done to-night," said Mr. Del-
mour, looking at his watch.
“Something has been done already," replied his Lordship,

ment."
As the servant at that moment announced supper, this was
a very bright sally for the Earl, though it did not produce
all the effect he had expected.
“Mr. Delmour, you will conduct Miss St. Clair to the
supper-room;" and Colonel Delmour, with infinite reluctance,
was obliged to relinquish her hand to his brother. With no
less unwillingness did she bestow it, and her chagrin was not
lessened at finding herself placed between the uncle and
nephew at supper, and condemned to hear, without being
able to listen to their conversation, which now, in spite of
Miss Pratt's desultory gabble, continued to flow in the same
political channel. Gertrude heard, with weariness, the whole
preliminaries of an active canvass fully discussed across her,
and while her imagination yet dwelt with delight on the me-
lodius accents and impassioned sentiments which had so lately
been poured into her ear, and found entrance to her heart,
she mentally exclaimed—“How impossible would it be ever
to love a man who can only talk of votes, seats, rolls, and
qualifications !"

"Well, what do you think of our member?" was Miss
Pratt's first salutation to Gertrude, as they met next morning
in their way to breakfast; then, without waiting a reply, “Í
thought you looked very wearied last night, and no wonder,
for I declare my back was like to break with their politics.

must not get that pretty white skin of yours sun-burnt; but
we'll not go farther than the Portico. I looked into the room
as I passed, and there was nobody there but Lord Rossville,
sitting as usual watching the teapot, like a clocking-hen. It's
a great pity that he will make the tea himself. I declare I'm
like to choke sometimes before I can get a drop, and, after

all, it's really just water bewitched. It's a thousand pities,
honest man ! that he will think he can do everything better
than anybody else. But here comes Edward Lyndsay from
his walk; I dare say he has been at some good turn already.
Good morning, Mr. Edward, where have you been strolling to
this fine morning?. Miss St. Clair and I are just taking a
little chat here, in the sun, till the breakfast's ready ; for, as
Anthony Whyte says, I don't like to descend to vacuity.
What do you think Miss St. Clair says of our member, that
she does not think him any great acquisition as a member of
the family, whatever he may be as a member for the county
-isn't that very good ?”
Gertrude was about to disclaim the witticism, when Mr.
Lyndsay saved her the trouble.
“So good,” replied he,“ that I am surprised you should give
the credit of it to anybody else : Miss St. Clair, I am sure, is
incapable of making such a remark."
“ Is that meant as a compliment to you or me, my dear?”
addressing Gertrude.—“But I wish you would explain, Mr.
Edward, what makes you think Miss St. Clair incapable of
saying that.”
“Because, as a physiognomist, I pronounce Miss St. Clair
incapable of making so ill-natured a remark upon one of
whom she has as yet had no opportunity of forming an
opinion.”
“ And what do you call that remark of your own, pray,
Mr. Edward ?” interrupted Miss Pratt, with considerable
pique ; “ for my part, I think it as ill-natured a one as ever I
heard."
“ You wished to hear the truth,” said he, with a smile ;
“it is not my fault if it is not agreeable.".
"To tell you the truth, Mr. Lyndsay, it's not by speaking
what
you call the truth upon every occasion, that people will
ever make friends to themselves in this world. I never knew
any of your plain-spoken people that didn't make twenty
enemies for one friend. I know nobody that likes to have
what you call the truth told them ; do you, my dear ?” to
Gertrude.
“ Yes," answered Gertrude, “I think I should like to hear
the truth from an amiable person; but the reason it is so dis-
agreeable, I suppose, is, because people are always so cross
when they speak what they call the truth, that it seems as if
they only used it as a cloak for their own ill-humour and
caprice, or a thousand other deadly sins.".
"Well, I'm sure, if you've a mind to hear the truth, you
could not be in better hands, my dear, than your cousin's for
it. But there's that abominable gong again, we must really

fly, for Lord Rossville will be out of all patience ;” and off
pattered Miss Pratt, leaving her companions to follow her
nimble steps. Nobody had yet appeared at the breakfast-
table but Lord Rossville and Mr. Delmour, who had resumed
the subject of the election with renewed vigour. Miss Pratt,
seeing his Lordship so engrossed, had seized upon the teapot,
and was enjoying the luxury of filling her cup by stealth.
Mr. Lyndsay seated himself by Gertrude ; it was the place
Colonel Delmour usually occupied, and she looked a little
disappointed at seeing it filled by another; he did not appear
to notice it, but continued the conversation-
I perfectly agree with you in what you were saying, of
the use or abuse of truth,” said he; “but even that is not so
dangerous as the delusions of falsehood and flattery, com-
monly called politeness and admiration.”
"These are hard words to give to very agreeable things,”
answered Gertrude.
“My quarrel is not with the things themselves,” said he
" but with their counterfeits."
“Yet, if every one were to tell another exactly what they
thought of them, I dare say we should be all scratching each
other's eyes out."
“Not if ours was the charity that thinketh no evil.”
“Oh! that is to say, if we were all angels."
“No, it is to say, if we were all Christians." Gertrude
stared with some surprise, for her idea of a Christian, like
that of many other people's
, was, that all were Christians
who were born in Christendom, had been baptized, learnt
their creeds, and went now and then to church.
“I fatter myself I am a Christian,” said she ; "and yet I
cannot help thinking there are people in the world who are
very tiresome, very impertinent, and very disagreeable, yet
I don't think it would be a very Christian act were I to tell
them so."
“Certainly not,” answered Mr. Lyndsay, with a smile ;
"you may think them all those things, but if you think of
them, at the same time, in the spirit of kindness and Chris-
tian benevolence, you will pity their infirmities, and you will
have no inclination to hurt their feelings by telling them of
faults which you cannot mend.”
“But if I were asked-or suppose I were to ask you to tell
me my faults ?"
“I should certainly endeavour to do it to the best of my
ability.”
"Well
, pray, begin, I should like to have my character
drawn in a Christian-like manner," said she, laughing.

it. I am not one of those nimble artists who can take
striking likenesses in five minutes."
“So much the better, for they are always hideous per-
formances ; but how long will you take to make a good full-
length portrait of me, for I really long to see myself in my
true colours, as a mere mortal, not as a goddess ?"
" You run no such risk with me, I assure you," said he ;
“but as to the time, that must depend upon circumstances
and opportunities--perhaps in a year."
“ A year!” exclaimed Gertrude. 66 O heavens! I shall die
of impatience in a month; to be a whole year of hearing a
single fault!"
"I did not say so," replied Mr. Lyndsay ;
as errors, like
straws, you know, always float on the surface, I shall be able
to pick up plenty of them, I have no doubt, very soon, it I
have not got hold of one or two already; but you would
not have me pronounce upon your character from them?
-many pearls of great price may lie hid below."
Which, I'm afraid, you will never discover,” said Ger-
trude, laughing : so, if my picture is not to be drawn till
then, I fear I shall be wrinkled, and old, and ugly, before you
have found a single gem to deck me with."
“I hope not,” answered he; “you say you love truth and
sincerity; these are jewels in themselves, and their light may
lead even my darkened eyes (as you seem to think them) to
discover more. But to drop metaphor, and speak in plain
terms, why, since we both profess to like truth, should we not
agree to speak it to each other ?"
“With all my heart," answered Gertrude ; “but we must
settle the preliminaries, draw up the code of laws, and swear
to observe them. In the first place, then, we must make a
solemn vow, on all occasions to speak the truth, and nothing
but the truth, coûte qu'il coûte; in the second place, that
nothing so said is to give mortal offence to the one party or
the other; in the third, that however disagreeable we may
think each other, we are to make a point of declaring it, in
the civillest and most Christian-like manner imaginable ; in
the fourth place-
Beware,” said Mr. Lyndsay, interrupting her, “ of coming
under any engagements, since Lord Bacon says, “It asketh a
strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell the truth,'
and
you know not what a savage man you have to deal with;
-no, let it be a discretionary compact, with mutual confidence,
its only guarantee ;” and he held out his hand. Gertrude
gave him hers, and, as she did so, she was struck, for the
first time, with_the bland and beautiful expression of his
countenance. “I never can fear you," said she, with a smile ;

-but the conversation was broken off by the entrance of the
rest of the fanıily, and the consequent matin greetings that
ensued. Colonel Delmour was the last who entered, and a
shade of displeasure darkened his brow at finding the seat he
considered as exclusively his own occupied by another. Ger-
trude observed his chagrin, and felt secretly flattered by it.
The only vacant seat was one by Miss Pratt, who had hitherto
restrained her tongue for the benefit of her ears, both of
which had been on the full stretch, the one to pick up certain
little political pieces of information, which it had reason to
suppose were not intended for it, the other to make itself
master of what was going on at the opposite side of the table,
betwixt Miss St. Clair and Mr. Lyndsay.
It was wonderful how well these two members contrived
to execute their respective offices, though certainly the chief
merit was due to their mistress, who had trained these, her
laithful servants, to such perfection in their calling that each
of them, singly, could perform the work, and more than the
work, of any ordinary pair of ears in the kingdom. What
the industrious ear had collected the active brain was not long
in concocting, nor the nimble tongue in circulating.
look very grave this morning, Colonel," said she, addressing
her neighbour; “I wish you had been here a little sooner it
would have done your heart good to have seen and heard the
fine flirtation that's been carrying on over the way," with a
significant nod to the opposite side of the table. "I can tell
you, Mr. Edward and a certain fair lady have been looking
very sweet upon each other—it's not often he takes a flirting
fit, but I'm really glad to see your godly people can be just
like their neighbours sometimes, and come as good speed too
when they set about it. What do you think ? " lowering her
voice; "she's going to sit to him for her picture-a full
length with pearls in her hair ; and what do you think?"-
stili lower— he's to make her a present of the pearls—I've
a notion his mother's, for I know she had a very fine set.
He did not seem inclined (to tell the truth) to part with
them so soon, for I heard him say something about a year ;
but, says she, with her pretty winning smile, what's the good
of keeping things till one's old, and bald, and toothless, and
can't enjoy them ? So much for French ease—who would
expect that, to look at her? But, my gracious! Colonel, do
you see what you've done ? spilt your whole cup of coffee
upon my good new gown—I wonder how you contrived it
and you're going to pour the cream upon me next,” pushing
her chair from him with the greatest velocity ; "'pon my
word, one would think you did it on purpose."
Colonel Delmour made no attempt to vindicate himself

from so foul an insinuation ; but, with his shoulder turned
to the offended fair, lounged over the “Morning Post," as if
quite unconscious of her presence. But, although he despised
her too much to deign to express his disbelief of her commu-
dication, he was secretly provoked at the good understanding
that seemed to exist between the cousins. He had too high
an opinion of himself to have any fear of Lyndsay as a rival ;
but he had his own private reasons for wishing to have him
kept at a distance, at least, till he had secured, beyond a
doubt, the affections of Miss St. Clair. Besides, he was one
of those who disliked all interference with whatever object he
chose to appropriate to himself, be it horse, hound, or heart.
He, therefore, determined to put a stop to this growing
intimacy, and to seize the first opportunity of bringing
matters to an issue.
In the presence of Colonel Delmour and Miss Pratt it was
seldom Mr. Lyndsay had an opportunity of being duly ap-
preciated, for in their company he was generally silent. Not
that he had such a respect for their conversation as induced
him to play the part of a mere listener; on the contrary, he
gave little attention to either of them; but he was not a per-
son to interrupt or watch for a pause, or in any way seek to
attract the notice of the company. The unobtrusive qualities
of his mind, therefore, did not strike upon the fancy with the
same glare as the more dazzling characteristics of Colonel
Delmour; and where, as in the minute occurrences of do-
mestic life, there are few or no opportunities of displaying
the loftier and nobler attributes of mind, it can only be by
slow and imperceptible degrees such a character gains upon
the affections. A single sentence might have summed up his,
in the brief but comprehensive words of an eloquent writer,
for of Lyndsay it might truly be said, that “he set an ex-
ample of all the moral virtues without pride, and dared to be
conspicuous for all the Christian graces without false shame."
But Gertrude saw nothing of all thism-she saw only that a
gloom hung upon Colonel Delmour's brow which she would
fain have dispelled ; and for that purpose she would have lin-
gered beyond the rest of the party to have given him an op-
portunity of expressing his disquiet; but she was called away
by her mother to prepare for a visit to her uncle, Mr. Adam
Ramsay.

CHAPTER XV.
The day was hot even to sultriness, and neither Mrs. St.
Clair nor her daughter were inclined to converse beyond a
passing remark now and then on the beat, dust, road, sun,
&c. Both, indeed, were too agreeably occupied with their
own meditations for any interchange of thought. The former
was busy revolving how she was to carry uncle Adam and
his seventy thousand pounds by a coup de main:' and, as a
preliminary step, had provided herself with a French musical
snuff-box and a dozen of embroidered cambric pocket-hand-
kerchiefs. But Mrs. St. Clair little knew the person she had to
deal with when she thought to propitiate him by any such
sacrifices. Mr. Adam Ramsay was a man of a fair character,
strong understanding but particular temper, and unpleasing
manners, with a good deal of penetration, which, as is too
often the case, served no other purpose than to disgust him
with his own species. He had left home penniless, at an
early period of life, to push his fortune in the world, and
after having toiled and broiled for fifty years he had returned
to what was now become a stranger land, laden with wealth
which he had no longer even the wish to enjoy. He felt
that he had lived in vain. He had no one to love— no one to
share in his possessions—and that only cordial which can give
a relish even to the dregs of life was not his—the treasures he
had laid up were all of this world ; and to a childless cynical
old man, perhaps great wealth is even more galling than great
poverty. Yet there were good points in his character, and
perhaps, had he been a husband and father, and had his
heart been kept alive to the tender charities of life, he might
have proved an amiable man, and an agreeable member of
society. He possessed strong natural affections, which,
though they had lain long dormant, were not yet extinct. It
was said that in early youth he had loved and been beloved
by one as poor and as friendless, and somewhat lower in
degree than himself, and that it was in the hope of gaining
affluence for her that he had crossed the seas, and sought his
fortunes in a foreign land. But many are the disappointments
that precede the fulfilment of our hopes, and many a year
rolled on, and found Mr. Ramsay as poor as at the first, till,
despairing of ever being able to return and claim his bride,
he wrote to release her from her promise of awaiting his
re'urn. The fortune at length was made, but too late the

71
gay dreams of youth were fled for ever! His mistress had
married, and was dead, and the sanguine adventurous strip-
ling was grown into the soured misanthropic old man. Such
was the outline of uncle Adam's story, and little more
remains to be said of him.
He lived much alone, had all the habits of a recluse, and
all the little peculiarities which are supposed to belong to
single gentlemen of a certain age. In particular he had an
extreme dislike to receiving those delicate attentions which are
sometimes so assiduously rendered to the rich and the child-
less. Not Timon himself was more tenacious in this respect
than uncle Adam, or more disposed to buffet all whom he
suspected of a design to prey upon his hoards. The house
he now inhabited was one he had taken as a temporary resi-
dence on his first arrival; and although he had bought a fine
estate with a suitable mansion in the immediate vicinity, and
every day had purposed taking possession of it, yet each
revolving term found him sitting in the selfsame parlour, in
the selfsame chair, and in the selfsame frame of mind. It
was at this suburban villa that the handsome equipage of the
Earl of Rossville now stopped. It was a small, vulgar, star-
ing red house, with a plot of long bottle-green grass in
front, and a narrow border of the coarsest of flowers, or
rather flowering weeds interspersed with nettles, growing
thin and straggling from a green slimy-looking soil, and
covered with dust from the road, from which it was only se-
parated by a railing. Mrs. St. Clair reddened with shame
as she marked the contemptuous air with which the conse-
quential footman rapped on the humble door-for bell or
knocker there was none. The door was speedily flung open
to its farthest extent, by a fat, rosy, stamping damsel, in a
flaming gown and top-knots, who testified the greatest ala-
crity in doing the honours of the entrance.
"What a habitation for a man with seventy thousand
pounds !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, as she entered; but
there was no time for pursuing her observations, for she was
the next minute in the little parlour of uncle Adam. It was
a small close room, with a meridian sun streaming full into
it, and calling forth to view myriads of "dancing motes that
people the sunbeams," while innumerable hosts of huge
Aies buzzed and revelled in all the luxury of its heat, and an
expiring fire, with its usual concomitants of dust and ashes,
seemed fast sinking beneath the influence of the god of Day.
A small dining-table, and a few hair-cloth chairs stuck against
the walls, comprised the whole furniture of the room. A
framed table of weights and measures, an old newspaper,
and a parcel of dusty parchments, tied with a red tape, formed

its resources and decorations. Altogether it wore the com-
fortless aspect of a bad inn's worst parlour—a sort of place
where one might pass five minutes while changing horses, but
where there was no inducement even for the weary traveller
to tarry.
Mr. Ramsay sat by the side of the expiring fire, seemingly
contemplating the gaists and cinders which lay scattered over
the hearth ; but he had somewhat the air of a man prepared
(rather unwillingly) to receive company. He was above the
middle size, with high stooping shoulders, sharp cross-looking
elbows, projecting far beyond his back, a somewhat stormy.
blue face, and little pale eyes, surmounted by shaggy white
eyebrows. His ordinary head-piece, a striped woollen
nightcap, had been laid aside for a capacious powdered
peruke with side curls, and a large queue. "To complete the
whole, he was left-handed, which gave a peculiar awkward-
ness to his naturally ungainly deportment. He welcomed
Mrs. St. Clair with a mixture of cordiality and awkwardness,
as if he wished to be kind, but did not know very well how
to set about it. She had too much manner, however, to allow
him to remain under any embarrassment on that score ; and
was squeezing uncle Adam's somewhat reluctant hand, and
smiling on his rugged visage, and uttering a thousand soft and
civil things to his rather averted ear, when suddenly she
stopped, for she felt that all was thrown away. Her uncle
had fixed his eyes on Gertrude, and regarding her with visible
emotion, seemed unconscious of every other object.
“Who is that ?” at length demanded he, in an agitated
voice.
“Pardon me, my, dear uncle," replied Mrs. St. Clair ;
“but, in my happiness at seeing you, I forgot that my
daughter was likewise a stranger to you."
“ Your daughter !", exclaimed Mr. Ramsay, “it's not
possible !"
“Why so, my dear uncle ?" asked Mrs. St. Clair, with a
smile, and in full expectation of a gallant compliment on her
own youthful appearance.
“She's the very picture of ; but you'll no mind Lizzie
Lundie-bonny Lizzie Lundie.” He gave a sort of growling
sigh, and a pause followed. Visions of former days seemed
to crowd into the old man's mind, and he went on as if com-
muning with himself,—“I little thought when I parted frae
her, fifty year come Martinmas, that I had ta'en my last look
o' Lizzie, and as little did I think, when I heard she was
gane, that I should ever live to see her like in this warld-
no that she just matches Lizzie neither;" and something like
a tear gleamed in his eye, as he continued to gaze on the

73
image of his youthful fancy. Gertrude's style of dress was
such as helped to heighten the illusion. Owing to the heat
of the day, she had thrown off her bonnet, and the band
that confined her hair wore almost the appearance of the
snood, which had been the prevailing fashion for damsels of
Lizzie's degree in her day; her throat also was uncovered,
and the whole contour of the head was thus displayed at
once in all the simplicity of nature, and one more strikingly
beautiful could scarcely be conceived.
Confused by the blunt admiration thus expressed for her,
Gertrude looked to her mother, and, struck with the deadly
paleness of her countenance, she hastily exclaimed, “Mamma,
you are ill;" and Mrs. St. Clair, gasping for breath, sank
almost lifeless in her daughter's arms. Air-air," was all
she could articulate ; and that certainly was the one thing
needful in uncle Adam's apartment, for the atmosphere was
indeed suffocating. The door and window were instantly
thrown
open ; Gertrude held a glass of water to her mother's
pallid lips; and Mr. Ramsay stuffed a bunch of southern-
wood into her powerless hand. At length these restoratives
appeared to produce their effects, and Mrs. St. Clair slowly
revived. Due apologies were of course made and accepted;
the uncommon heat of the day was much commented on,
and the closeness of the room delicately hinted at. Some
refreshments, not of the choicest description, were now
brought in by the great awkward heavy-footed maid-servant ;
and Mr. Ramsay, taking a glass of wine, drank a welcome to
his niece on her return to Scotland, " and to the bonny
creature you have brought with you,” added he, again fixing
his eyes on Gertrude. “ After all," continued he, “the
thing's not impossible-Lizzie was a relation of ours—a
distant one, to be sure. Let me see-Lizzie's father and my
father were cousin-germains' bairns—but that'll no do, for it's
by the other side o' the house—it was by my father."
Mrs. St. Clair's colour rose to the deepest crimson, and
she seemed struggling to subdue her feelings. At length,
making an effort at self-control, she said, with affected
pleasantry, “I have no doubt my daughter has great
rcason to be flattered at the resemblance you have discovered
for her ; but, my dear uncle, you know there are certain
prejudices-certain notions that some people entertain-in
short, the thing to be talked of amongst ourselves is very
well; and it is very flattering to me that my daughter's
looks should afford you pleasure; but I own I-I should be
sorry,I would rather that a report of such a resemblance
were not to reach the Rossville family; they now consider
my daughter as one of themselves; and their pride might be

hurt, you know, and a prejudice created, that might prove
highly detrimental to Gertrude's best interests."
"Set them up with their pride !" cried Mr. Ramsay, all
softer emotions giving way to indignation ; "their pride hurt,
indeed, at being compared to Lizzie Lundie! There's no a
Rossville or a St. Clair among them that e'er I saw was fit to
tie Lizzie Lundie's shoe—the Queen upon the throne might
have thought it an honour to be compared to Lizzie ; " and
the little chamber seemed as though it would not contain him
in his wrath, as he paced up and down its narrow bounds,
with his hands crossed behind his back : all shyness and em-
barrassment had vanished in this burst of passion, and uncle
Adam stood revealed in his own character. Then suddenly
stopping,—“And what would hae come o’ye if Lizzie Lundie
had been what I ance thought she would ha'e been—my
wedded wife? What would your Rossvilles ha'e done then ?
Would you ha'e thought it a disgrace then, that your daughter
should ha'e been likened to your uncle's wife ?"
“Oh! this is too much !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair,
bursting into tears.
“What's too much ?” cried he, continuing to walk up and
down in great discomposure. Then suddenly stopping, and
softening at sight of his niece's distress, -" Come, come-
what's a' this for? Waes me, ye ha'e suffered little in the
warld, if the hasty word o' an auld man can set ye off this
way-ye'll ken me better by-and-bye than to mind a' that I
say ;"—then patting Gertrude on the shoulder, as she hung
over her mother,_" It's you that has made us cast out, and
it's you that maun make us 'gree.”
Gertrude took her mother's hand, and put it into her
uncle's. He took it kindly ; and Mrs. St. Clair, as soon as
she found voice, said, "Excuse me, my dear uncle, I
am ashamed of my weakness; but my nerves are now so
shattered, and my spirits are not what they once were. I
have a difficult part to play, and it is not surprising if-In
short, dependent as I am on the relations of my child—and
that dear child's interest so much at stake too—you cannot
wonder if I am sometimes driven-if I sometimes stoop-if I
should sometimes tremble-
Mrs. St. Clair seemed at a loss to finish, but her uncle
saved her the trouble. “Aye, aye, you have a proud thrawn
pack to deal wi', I believe."
“Then, you understand, my dear uncle, the reason of my
wishing that"
"Aye, aye, ye needna be feared for me; but I maun aye

the whole with,—“Since I saw Lizzie Lundie, I've never
seen the woman that I thought worth the looking at till

furbelowed, entered the little yard, and approached the
house. 6. There's ane o' the fule tribe," cried he; “my

stay, since
“WHAT's brought you here, Miss Bell ?" was his salutation
on entering ; but nowise daunted with what, indeed, she was
well accustomed to, she boldly shook hands with all around,
and then showing a small basket,—“I have brought you some
very fine strawberries, uncle; they are the first we have had
in our garden; and I assure you, I have had much ado
to keep them from the children for you ;"—and with a conse-
quential air, she disclosed some dozen or two of very 80-80
looking strawberries.
“You had very little to do then," said Mr. Ramsay. “I
wad na gie a bawbee for aw the berries in your garden; so ye
may just tak them back to whar ye brought them frae; or
ye ha'e robbed your brithers and sisters o' them,
puir things, there's a barber's bairn twa doors aff, that wad
maybe be glad o’them-it's lying in the mizzles."
66 Pon my word, uncle,” said Miss Bell in great indigna-
tion, “I have something else to do than to pick strawberries
for barber's brats, indeed." But uncle Adam, going to the
door, called the maid, and giving her the strawberries, di-
rected her to carry the berries to Rob Rattray's bairn, and
to ask how he was.' Miss Bell prudently turned a deaf ear
to the message, and was apologising, with all her powers of
eloquence, to Mrs. St. Clair and her daughter, for not having
been to visit them—"But the truth is,” said she, with a well
got-up air of modesty," that, in my situation, visiting is out
of the question. If I were to go to one place, I should have
to go everywhere, and the Major has so many connections in
the country, who, of course, would expect me to come to
them, that it would be extremely unpleasant in my situation,
where the thing is so well known. This, I assure you, is the
only place I ever go to, as I think it a positive duty (lower-
ing her voice) to pay attention to my uncle, poor man, and

this room,
I am the only one of the family who understands his ways,
and can manage him." Mr. Ramsay, having for the moment
appeased the antipathy he bore his niece by the insult he had
offered her, was now restored to something like good-humour.
“Weel, Miss Bell,” said he," what have you made of your
rawbob-your swain-your loveyer-your what-do-ye-call-
him?"
“ If you mean the Major," said Miss Bell with dignity,
"he walked into town with me, and is gone to look at a pair
of carriage-horses that are for sale at the White Bear just
now;
I
suppose he will be here in a little;"—then drawing
back' from the window with a face of alarm, as a carriage
passed-
“I really wish, uncle, if you mean to remain here, you
would get a blind for your window, for everybody is seen in
and in my situation, it is not very pleasant, I
assure you, to be exposed to everybody that passes ; —that was
the Boghall carriage that passed just now, and they must
think it very odd to have seen me sitting here when I declined
an invitation to dinner there for to-morrow, upon the plea that
I went nowhere at present.”
“ Then what brings you here, if you're no fit to be seen ?”
demanded uncle Adam in a most wrathful accent.
“I must confess, my dear uncle," said Mrs. St. Clair, glad
of an opening for expressing her sentiments, and, at the same
time, softening the tone of the conversation, " this house does
not seem quite suitable for you."
“ What ails the house?” asked he sharply.
"I beg pardon, I understood, perhaps I was misinformed,
that you were the proprietor of a charming place in this
neighbourhood.”
« Weel?” This was put in so startling a manner, that Mrs.
St. Clair's courage failed her, and she feared to reply ;-not
so Miss Bell.
“Well! to think of anybody in their senses living in this
little, vulgar, shabby hole, when they have such a house as
Bloom-Park standing empty; I assure you, uncle, it has a
very odd appearance in the eyes of the world.”
“Miss Bell Black, you that's such a wise, sensible, weel-
informed woman, that ken's aw thing, will you just ha'e the
goodness to tell me, what are the eyes of the warld, and whar
do they stand? For muckle I ha'e beard of the eyes o' the
warld, but I ha'e never been able to see them yet;' and Mr.
Ramsay fixed his upon her, while he advanced his face almost
close to her, and put his hands on his knees, in a manner
that seemed to say, “ Answer me this before you stir.".
Miss Bell hesitated a little" Why, I can only tell you,

uncle, that Lord Fairacre was quite confounded when the
Major told him you had never taken possession of Bloom-
Park yet, and said it was most extraordinary that you
should
continue to live in a house that was hardly good enough for a
dog-kennel; and Boghall, who was present, said, he did not
believe the whole house was the size of his kitchen, and the
Major himself I know thinks-
" And so these are the eyes of the warld !” cried Mr.
Ramsay, with a sort of growling sardonic laugh; "pretty
eyes they are, to be sure, to drive a man out of his ain house!
The tane a poor silly spendthrift, the t'ither a great gor-
mandising swash, and the third—but how comes the warld to
have but three eyes ?--can you no mak out a fourth ?-I beg
your pardon, I suppose your ain was to be the fourth, and
that makes aw right, for then ye can gie the warld twa faces;
Fairacre's and Boghall on the tae face, Major Waddell and
Miss Bell Black on the t'ither;"—then in a lower key, and
muttering to himself, " Spendthrifts and ne'erdoweels on the
tae side, fules and tawpies on the t'ither, a true picture o' the
warld.”
Any other than Miss Bell would certainly have given in
here; but Miss Bell was one of those gifted mortals who are
quite invulnerable to the shafts of envy, hatred, or malice,
when it is their interest to be so; and though she did look a
little hot and disconcerted for a few minutes, she quickly ral-
lied, and resumed-
“I assure you, uncle, whatever you may think, the opinion.
of the world is not to be despised.”
“Miss Bell Black, I have lived rather longer in the world
than
you have done, and I've seen rather mair o't than you're
ever likely to see—and I would nae gie that,” snapping his
fingers, " for either its gude word or its ill; it canna say that
ever I oppressed them that were beneath me,-or cringed to
them that were aboon me,,or that I ever wranged ony crea-
ture o' a bodle,-or that I ever said the thing I didna think ;
and if either you or you're warld think I'm to be dictated to
in my ain house, you're much mistaken.”
“Well, uncle, I can only say, I think it is a great pity that
so fine a place as Bloom-Park should be standing empty; and
since you seem resolved not to live at it yourself, there's many
a one, I assure you, would be glad to take it off _your
hands.
The Major has been looking at Elm Grove—but I think there
is no comparison between Bloom-Park and it."
" What then?" demanded Mr. Ramsay.
“Oh, nothing. Only if you had any thoughts of letting it,
it is such a Paradise, that-

interrupted her uncle; “ your nawbob and you for instance,"
-with a growling grin ;—“ but I can tell you, ye'll no play
your gambols chere if I can help it.”
Miss Bell looked very indignant as she replied,-—"As to
that, the Major cares very little about the matter; if I am
pleased, that is all he is anxious about, and the rent is no ob-
ject; but I find it very difficult to get a place to suit us in
every respect—but here is the Major himself,”—and the Major
was presently ushered in. Mr. Ramsay received him with
tolerable civility, and Mrs. St. Clair, desirous of receiving his
vote at the approaching election, was preparing the way by a
soft speech about nothing. But Miss Bell never permitted the
Major to speak to, or look at, or listen to anybody else when
she was present, and she therefore called him off with-
Well, Major, did you see the carriage-horses, and what do
you think of them ?
“They seem good serviceable horses—not particularly
handsome," replied he.
" What colour ?-I'll thank you for a glass of water,
Major."
Pray allow me to put a little wine in it."
“The least drop—and you think they will do ? --Oh! not
so much."
“ That is not for me to decide,” replied the Major with a
bow-which was graciously acknowledged with a smile.
“ Perhaps you will take a look of them yourself ?"
Why, in my situation,"—in a modest key—“I hardly
think I should like to go to the White Bear—Major, will you
take this glass ?”
“But I shall desire the ostler to bring them up here, 'tis
but a step from the stables."
“ I'm for none of your horses brought to my door,” cried
Mr. Ramsay; “it will be through the town I'm setting up
my chaise next, and a bonny hully baloo there'll be,” and he
paced the room in great perturbation at the bare supposition
of such a thing
“My dear sir," began the Major, but he was cut short
with-
“Now I'm for none of your horses at my door."
" Bless me, uncle !” cried Miss Bell, “I think you may be
very well pleased to get the credit of a carriage at such an

auld ostentatious fule.”
"Such nonsense, uncle !—at any rate, I thought you did
not care what the world said of you."
“You thought!" repeated uncle Adam, with the most
easy rate."

sovereign contempt; and what entitles you to think ?--but ye
need say nae mair aboot it—there's to be nae horses brought
to my door. If ye maun ha'e horses, ye maun gang to the
horse-market for them, like other folk—I'm no to ha'e my
house turned into a White Bear."
“My dear sir,” said the Major.
“In my situation," interrupted Miss Bell, “it would
have a very odd appearance in the eyes of the world”.
but here Mrs. St. Clair interposed, by offering to chaperon
her niece to the White Bear in Lord Rossville’s carriage,
hoping to be repaid for this civility by securing the Major's
vote. The offer, after a little affected demur, was accepted,
and the Major was dispatched to have the horses in readiness.
“I really think, uncle, you might dispense with a fire
now,” remarked Miss Bell, as she rose to depart.
“Do ye ken naething else I could dispense wi'?” demanded
Mr. Ramsay, with a look and emphasis that might have made
a tortoise fly: not so Miss Bell, who still lingered, in the
desperate hope of showing her consequence, and proving her
influence over uncle Adam and his seventy thousand pounds.
“Well, uncle, when are we to see you at Bellevue ?".
“I would prefer my claim for a visit,” said Mrs. St. Clair,
with her most winning smile; “ but Lord Rossville intends
himself to have the pleasure of calling upon you, and—-"
“In hopes of getting my vote,” interrupted Mr. Ramsay,
impatiently; “but he may just save himself the trouble
I'm no gaun to be hunted out o' my senses by your election
hounds. I'll gie my vote to wha I like, or maybe I'll keep
it to mysel—but there's ae thing I can tell you, it's no to be
had for the asking."
Mrs. St. Clair prudently received this rebuff in silence ;
but Miss Bell plucked up fresh spirit at witnessing another's
discomfiture, and taking her uncle by the breast of the coat,
and drawing him back, she began in an under tone of voice,
as if desirous of not being overheard,-
“ By-the-bye, uncle, talking of votes, there's one thing
that I feel very anxious about, and that is, that the Major
and you should concert something together as to your votes ;
it would be extremely awkward, I think, if you were to take
different sides, and have a very odd appearance in the eyes
of
the world."
Whatever uncle Adam's thoughts might be, his looks por-
tended a storm ready to burst forth ; but as Gertrude turned
towards him, to wish him good morning, his features relaxed,
and his frown gradually softened into something like a
smile.

visitors drive off, and returned to his little dusty sunny par.
lour, elate with the triumph of having defied the world and
But before parting with Mr. Ramsay, we must here ob-
serve, that he is not the only one who has attempted to walk
as if uncontrolled by the scan of that dread power, commonly
called the eyes of the world. Few, if any, however, have
ever arrived at entire emancipation from its influence, which
extends more or less over all mankind. Uncle Adam flattered
himself that he was one of the happy few who had escaped
from its thraldom; but, alas ! poor man, its yoke was still
upon him, and, unconscious of his chains, he hugged himself
in his freedom. He cared not, indeed, that the world should
call him a miser-he cared not that the world should call
him a churl-he cared not that the world should call him
odd—he cared not that the world should say he lived in a
mean house, or wore a shabby hat, or an old-fashioned wig;
but he cared lest the world should think he cared for the
world—or should say that he was vain, or proud, or osten-
tatious, or expensive; and it was this which made him often
deny himself many a little comfort, many a harmless gratifi-
cation, many an innocent desire he had in common with that
world he so much despised. To be free from the eyes of the
world has been the aim of many, but the attainment of few.
Man is not born to be free, and when all restraint is laid
aside, the wickedness of the human heart displays itself in
the most hideous forms. 'Tis to the Christian alone that
such freedom belongs, and he only can say,
“ Je crains Dieu,
et n'ai point d'autre crainte."
CHAPTER XVII.
During their progress to the White Bear, Miss Bell indem-
nified herself for the mortifications she had received from her
uncle, by expressing herself in terms of the greatest pity and
contempt for him.

"Poor man !” said she, “I really feel for him,- for you
must know it is alleged I am his great favourite ; and when
that is the case, of course one will put up with a great deal.
Indeed, for my part, I know, his temper so well, I never
should think of being affronted at anything he could say ;
but I own I am sometimes afraid of the Major—a man of his
rank is not to be tampered with—and he has such a high
spirit, there is no saying how he might resent anything the
least like disrespect to me, though I know my poor uncle is
far from meaning anything of the kind. It is entirely his
manner, for I have been told he speaks very handsomely of
me behind my back; and when that is the case, one should
not mind what is said to their face. However, in my situa-
tion, it is certainly not pleasant, and when I am a married
woman, the thing must be put a stop to."
Here Mrs. Clair put a stop to that subject, by introducing
the one uppermost in her thoughts, that of the election, and
requesting her niece to use her influence with her lover on
the occasion. But Miss Bell, like all fools, had her share of
cunning, as well as of consequence; and she was aware that
the more doubts and difficulties she could attach to the
Major's vote, the more the Major's importance and her own
importance would be increased ; and she therefore made
answer,
Why, really, aunt, to tell you the truth, the Major has a
very difficult part to act; and it will require no small manage-
ment, I assure you, both in him and me, to avoid giving
offence to one side or the other. Connected as he is with the
Fairacre and Boghall families, it will be a strong step in him
to give his vote to the opposite party. At the same time, I
know I have only to say the word to secure him for my
friends ; but as I said to him, the world might reflect upon
me, were I to make use of my influence in so important a
matter. Besides, you know, aunt, I can say nothing till the
Major has been waited upon by Lord Rossville, and has been
paid proper attention to by the family; and it would also be
right, I think, if some of the ladies were to be introduced to
his sister, Mrs. Fairbairn, a very sweet woman, who lives a
little way from this.” But here the carriage drove up to the
White Bear, where neither the Major nor the horses were to
be seen ; but they were told both would be forthcoming pre-
sently. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to wait
patiently in the midst of the usual assemblage that is to be
seen lounging at an inn door-hostlers, drivers, stable-boys,
beggars, waiters, travellers, &c., &c., &c.
"This is very unpleasant,” said Miss Bell. “I wonder

my
how the Major could think of exposing a person in situa-
tion in this manner. I am sure I would rather have gone
without carriage-horses, than have had all these people's eyes
upon me.
There is one man, I declare he stares in such a
manner, I don't know where to look ; I wonder what he
means? I really wish he would bestow his attention on
somebody else; but perhaps, cousin, he's one of your French
beaux ?"
Mrs. St. Clair and Gertrude both looked in the direction
pointed out by Miss Bell, and both were struck by the ap-
pearance of the person in question, or rather by the earnest
scrutinizing look with which he regarded the party; for,
although handsome, there was nothing very striking either in
his dress or figure-nothing that was even indicative of the
station to which he might be supposed to belong. He was a
man seemingly turned of thirty, but might be more, with
fair but sun-burnt complexion, light hair, handsome, though
rather hawk nose, and keen bright blue eyes. Taken singly,
his features had no peculiarity in them; but there was some-
thing in the general expression of the countenance of rather
a marked and unpleasing character.
“I have surely seen that face before,” said Mrs. St. Clair,
endeavouring to recollect when and where.
“ I'm sure he won't forget some of ours," said Miss Bell ;
“ for I really never saw anything so impudent as the manner
in which he stares ; and such a shabby-looking creature, all
covered with dust! I dare say he is just off the top of some
coach ; I'm sure if the Major catches him staring so impu-
dently but here comes the Major and the carriage-
horses ; don't they look very well ?”—and then ensued a col.
loquy between the lovers.
" How do you like your steeds, Isabella ?”
“Not mine, Major ; you know I have nothing to do with
them: but what do you think of them yourself ? "
“My thoughts must be guided entirely by your taste.”
“Very gallant, indeed !"- and so forth in the usual style
of some such silly pair.
The stranger all the while kept his station, after asking a
question of one of the servants; but his looks, which, at
first, had wandered from one or other of the party, finally
rested on Gertrude, with an expression which it was impos-
sible to comprehend or define. It was neither admiration,
nor curiosity, nor pleasure, nor any of the common emotions
which a stranger might be supposed to entertain, but his
countenance assumed a sort of smile of exultation no less
strange than offensive. In some displeasure at so rude and
at

persevering a gaze, Gertrude raised her hand to pull down
the blind, when, suddenly springing forward, he laid his hand
on the door of the carriage.
6. What insolence !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair. The stranger
looked at her for a moment with a bitter, contemptuous smile,
then said,
“I would speak with you, madam."
Speak, then; say, what is your business ?" answered she
somewhat impatiently.
6. You would not wish me to declare it in the presence of
these ladies, I am sure,” replied the man, with a still more
familiar look and manner. Miss Bell's body and soul were
both half out of the opposite side of the carriage, as she
leaned over communing with the Major. Mrs. St. Clair,
therefore, answered haughtily,-
“ You can have nothing to say to me that my daughter may
not hear."
“Indeed !” exclaimed the stranger in an ironical tone: “Is
she then-” Mrs. St. Clair involuntarily bent her head
towards him, and the rest of the sentence was whispered in
her ear, when, uttering a half-stifled shriek, she sunk back,
pale, trembling, and convulsed.
" What's the matter ?" cried Miss Bell, turning round.
“Mamma has been frightened by that strange-looking man,"
answered Gertrude, in a low voice.
" Bless me !" cried Miss Bell, “ such nonsense, to be fright-
ened for any man when the Major is here"_then in a loud
key, “Major, I wish you would ask that person what he
6. Not for the world !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, suddenly
starting up in the most extreme agitation ; “I know him-I
have seen him before-I-I must speak to him myself,"
gasped she, as she motioned to have the carriage door opened.
Oh, mamma!” cried Gertrude, taking her mother's trem-
bling hand to detain her, “you are unable—allow me;" but
her mother seemed not to hear her, as, with the assistance of
the servants, she alighted, and, with an unsteady step, drew
near the stranger, who had withdrawn a few paces from the
carriage, apart from the bystanders.
“Good gracious !” exclaimed Miss Bell, in a whisper to
Gertrude ; "I see my aunt is terrified at the thoughts of in-
volving the Major with that man, and, to be sure, if he had
only seen how he stared at me, I dare say he would have
knocked him down, so it's better she should speak to him her-
self, as I am under her protection at present, you know.”
Gertrude made no reply, and Miss Bell, too much interested
in her carriage-horses to bestow her attention on any mere
wants."

THE INHERITANCE.
human concerns, quickly returned to the discussion of hoofs,
tails, manes, &c. Mrs. St. Clair, meanwhile, having ex-
changed a tew words with the stranger, returned to the car-
riage, still bearing visible signs of great mental disquiet.
“So, aunt, you have very soon disposed of your beau,"
began Miss Bell, no less deficient in common observation than
in delicacy. “Dear me, are we driving away, and nothing
settled about the carriage-horses yet? and where's the
Major? Major, Major-stop, driver, for the Major;" and
presently the Major's willow-green visage presented itself,
panting with the exertion of running after the carriage.
“I can make nothing of that fellow," said he, addressing
Mrs. St. Clair ; "he seems a most confounded insolent dog. If
I had been a justice of the peace, I should certainly have
committed him."
“I think you would have done quite right,” said Miss
Bell; “and I really think, aunt, you were a great deal too
soft with him. What did he say to you, Major ?."
“O, he was confoundedly impertinent, and if I had had
my bamboo, I should certainly have laid it across his shoul-
ders.”
“Well, I dare say it was better that you got out to speak
to him yourself, than that the Major should have taken him
in hand; but he would have deserved it," said Miss Bell, “ if
it had only been for his impudence in staring at me in the
manner he did ; but, by-the-bye, did not you say you knew
him, aunt ?"
Mrs. St. Clair's colour had undergone many variations
during this conversation, and Gertrude thought she read tor-
re in every feature and lineament of her countenance. But
in a voice which she vainly tried to render firm and composed,
she replied, “I have seen him before, only once, and that
under circumstances of distress in my husband's-
." Ilere
her emotion choked her utterance, and Miss Bell and the
Major, who were no nice observers, ascribed her agitation to
the only legitimate source of a widow's tears—the remem-
brance of her departed lord; and not being at all in a mood
to sympathise in any such sorrowful feelings, Miss Bell pro-
posed to alight and walk home with her lover, which was
readily acceded to by her aunt. “I trust I shall soon have
the pleasure of presenting Mrs. Waddell to you," said the
Major in a half whisper to Mrs. St. Clair.
Upon my word, Major, you are too bad,” said his fair,
affecting to turn away in displeasure.
“Have you bespoke your cousin's good offices on the occa-
sion, my love ?” asked the inamorato, in still softer accents.
“No-I really, Major-you know there is no hurry"

6 I beg your pardon ; I know just the reverse," replied the
gallant Major; but Mrs. St. Clair, sick of their vulgar airs,
here wished the happy pair good morning, and making a sign
to the servant, the carriage bounded away, leaving them far
behind. Gertrude naturally expected that her mother would
now give some explanation of the strange mysterious scene
that had taken place, though she had too much delicacy to
express any curiosity on the subject; but Mrs. St. Clair re-
mained silent and abstracted during the whole drive, and was
only roused from her musings by the sudden stopping of the
carriage, as it drew up at the castle.
“ Home already!" exclaimed she, looking round as if
awakened from a dream ; then in a languid, oppressed voice,
“Gertrude, I am ill—but I want no attentions,” waving her
off; “they can do me no good." Colonel Delmour, who had
been lounging on the lawn with his dogs, was now hastening
towards them. “Gertrude,” continued she, grasping her
daughter's hand, " be silent on the events of this day, as you
value my life." Gertrude shuddered, but the next moment
her hand was pressed in that of Colonel Delmour, as he
assisted her to alight, and her mother's fearful words were
almost driven from her thoughts by the raptures he expressed
at her return. His words were too delightful not to be lis-
tened to, and she loitered a few minutes on the steps.

elegant, graceful being can belong to the same species with an
Uncle Adam, or a Major Waddell I" Colonel Delmour saw
that he had lost nothing by her absence, and as her mother
turned to call her, he ventured to whisper somewhat of a
more serious import than he had yet done; Gertrude blushed,
smiled, and was gone.

CHAPTER XVIII.
On joining her mother in her apartment, Gertrude found her
walking to and fro in that manner which plainly indicates
great mental disquiet. She continued to pace backwards and
forwards for some time as if lost in thought, then suddenly
stopping, she said, somewhat abruptly, “ Gertrude, do you
remember your nurse?"
“Ah! mamma, can I ever forget her!" replied her daugh-
ter, tears springing to her eyes at the remembrance of all the
care and tenderness she had experienced for years from the
faithful creature.

“ Yes, I know you were very fond of her, and she of you.
Well, the stranger who caused me so great an alarm to-day
-was her husband."
"Her husband, mamma !" repeated Gertrude. “I thought
he had been dead many years ago ?”
“I thought so too; but unfortunately it is not so. - I say
unfortunately, for he is likely to prove a troublesome appen-
dage to us—those sort of people are always unreasonable;
and he seems to think his wife's care and attention to you,
and her long services in the family, give him a claim upon
our gratitude, which I fear I shall not find easy to answer. In
short, he seems a needy, rapacious man, urgent for money,
which I have not to give, and yet am loth to refuse."
“ It is certainly my duty to do something for him, mamma,"
answered her daughter; “but, you know, I have nothing
in my own power—all I can do is to speak to my uncle for
him -"
No, no,” cried Mrs. St. Clair, impatiently, “that will
never do ;" and she resumed her pacing up and down.
“Why may I not ask Lord Rossville to assist him, mamma ?”
inquired Gertrude, in some surprise. “Surely the husband
of my nurse, of one whom I loved so dearly, has a right to
expect something from us !"
Something-yes, something—but what is that something
to be? How much money have you got at present, Ger-
trude ?"
Her daughter named the sum, which was a very trifling
“ Good heavens! what shall I do!” exclaimed her
mother, with the look and accent of despair; “how shall I
ever be able to raise a sufficient sum-
“Dear mamma ! why should you distress yourself so much
about it? only suffer me to speak to my uncle."
“Gertrude, you will drive me mad—have I not told you
that it would be destruction to me to breathe a syllable of
this matter to any human being ? "
“ Destruction, mamma !" repeated her daughter in astonish-
ment, not unmixed with terror at her mother's vehemence.
“ Bring me what money you have-every sous, and no
questions; you will perhaps know all soon enough," mur-
mured she, throwing herself into a chair as if exhausted
with the violence of contending emotions; then rousing her-
self as her daughter was leaving the room to obey, and
fetch me your ornaments, Gertrude—all of them-quick, no
more words ;” and she waved her hand impatiently for her to
be gone. Gertrude was too well acquainted with her mother's
imperious manner to attempt any remonstrance, but she
could not conceal the astonishment and reluctance with which
one.

she set about obeying her. Having collected all the money
and the few jewels she possessed, she brought them to
her mother.
“Surely, mamma," said she, “it cannot be necessary for me
to give my ear-rings and bracelets to my nurse's husband !
The' money he is welcome to, but really I am churlish enough
to grudge him my trinkets."
Keep them, then," said Mrs. St. Clair, pushing them from
her with contemptą keep the paltry baubles, since it is too
great a sacrifice to part with them even to a parent."
“O, mamma, what cruel words! I spoke in jest_take
them—take all—everything that I have;" and she drew the
rings off her fingers, and unclasped those in her ears.
No, no," said her mother, in the same cold bitter tone,
“ keep your precious gewgaws-you surely would not give
your pearl necklace to save me from ruin ? that would be too
much, indeed !"
Mrs. St. Clair well knew how to turn to her own purposes
the quick generous temper of her daughter.
Stung to the soul by her mother's reproaches, Gertrude
burst into tears ; she besought her forgiveness—she implored
her to take the baubles, till at length she prevailed, and what
Gertrude would, in other circumstances, have considered a
sacrifice, she now looked upon as a privilege; so differently
do things appear according to the state of our minds !
“To show that I do not exact more from you than I do
from myself," said Mrs. St. Clair, going to her jewel-case,
I too must part with all I possess ;" and she took out all her
own ornaments, and began putting them up along with those
of her daughter. Gertrude assisted with a good grace, for
she was still in a state of excitement. She saw all her ele-
gant and fashionable bijouterie-all the cherished tokens of
remembrance-all the little gifts she had received from far
distant friends and companions, one by one, folded up, and
she still felt only joy in the thought that she had parted
with them for her mother; but she could not suppress a sigh
when she came to an old-fashioned hair-brooch, in the form
of a heart, set round with garnets—“That was the gift of
my dear nurse," said she, timidly, "and she made me pro-
mise that I never-
“Would part with it," subjoined Mrs. St. Clair. “Well,
keep your promise and your locket, Gertrude, it is of little
value - it can make no difference surely he would not
grudge you that."
“ He l" repeated Gertrude indignantly; “it is not for him,
it is for you—but why?"-she stopped, and looked inquiringly
in her mother's face.

“ Gertrude, it is natural that your curiosity should be ex-
cited by what you have seen and heard, and the time may
come-perhaps too soon-when it will be amply gratified; but
when it is, I tell you that it will—it must be-at the expense
of my life. Now speak—ask what you will, and I will answer
you, but it must be on these terms."
“Oh! mamma, what a wretch you must think me,” said
Gertrude, again giving way to her tears ; "headstrong-per-
verse-disobedient you may have found me, but surely I do
not deserve such killing words. Would that I could share in
your distresses, whatever they are, if by sharing I could
lessen them !"
Mrs. St. Clair shook her head, and sighed deeply. “I
believe you, Gertrude-I know you are superior to the mean-
ness of mere curiosity, and I think I may rely on your
affection-may I not?”
Her daughter answered by throwing herself into her
mother's arms, and Mrs. St. Clair pressed her to her bosom
with emotions of tenderness and affection, such as she had
never before displayed. When she regained her composure,
she said,
“Now, my love, we understand each other; you are aware
that my reserve proceeds from no distrust of you. I feel that
your forbearance is the result of your affection for me-hence-
forth all that you have to do is to prove your sincerity by
your silence. You have only to promise that you will never
disclose what you have witnessed, or what you may yet wit-
ness, in my conduct that may seem strange and mysterious,
and that you will never reveal what I have now told you
about that man 1-neither his name, nor his connection with
us, must you ever breathe as you
lue my life.”
Gertrude promised-solemnly promised, and her mother
again tenderly embraced her, declaring herself satisfied.
“You know not what a load it takes from my mind to find
you thus prudent, tractable, and confiding—with feeling
enough to participate in my vexations—with delicacy to re-
press all idle curiosity—with affection to assist me in my dif-
ficulties—may Heaven reward you, Gertrude, for all you
have done and will do for me! And now," continued she, as
she finished the packet she had been making up,
going to give you a yet stronger proof of the trust I place in
you. This packet must be delivered to-night to the person
for whom it is destined. I have promised to meet him at the
temple, near the end of the lime avenue, next the deer-park
at eleven o'clock, and you must accompany me—the family
will then be at supper-I shall plead a headache-alas no
vain pretext !"—and she pressed her daughter's hand to her

throbbing temples—"as an excuse for retiring to my room.
You will of course attend me, and we shall then find no
difficulty in stealing out unperceived. I know all you would
say, Gertrude,” continued she, in a quick impatient tone, as
she read her daughter's disapprobation in the glow that
mantled on her cheek; “but there is no alternative-it must
be so; yet if you repent your promise, I am ready to release
you from it, though my ruin should ensue. Speak—do you
wish to be free ?"
Gertrude could not speak, but she gave her mother her
hand in token of her submission, then turned shuddering away.
Her mother again caressed her.
“ Be composed, my love—all will yet go well—let us dress
for dinner," continued she, as her maid entered for the pur-
pose of preparing her toilette. Then whispering, “ Try to
look cheerful, my love; remember, looks may betray a secret
as well as words : put some flowers in your hair, and make
yourself at least look gay for my sake-do, my sweetest !"
Gertrude sighed, and they separated.
CHAPTER XIX.
It would have argued ill for Gertrude, if she could have
obeyed her mother's injunctions, and looked the thing she
was not. Time and suffering may teach us to repress our
feelings; but the young and untried heart can with difficulty
learn to conceal them. The most ingenuous and upright
mind may practise self-control; but it is only the artful and
the mean who will ever stoop to dissimulation. Agitated and
perplexed, in vain she strove to appear tranquil and disen-
gaged—the very attempt served only to defeat the purpose :
the more she thought of her mother's strange mysterious be.
haviour-and of what else could she think the more bewil-
dered she became in the maze of her own fancy; till at length,
despairing of regaining self-possession from her own secret
communings, she hastened to seek it in company, and, quickly
dressing herself, she descended to the drawing-room.
It required no great share of penetration to discover that
something more than common was passing in her mind; her
varying colour, her clouded brow, her thoughtful yet wan-
dering eye, so different from the usual open, bland expression
of her countenance, plainly indicated the state of her feel-
ings.
Lord Rossville, Mr. Delmour, and Mrs. St. Clair, were at

the farther end of the room in earnest conversation. She
was giving such an account of her visit to Mr. Ramsay, and
her meeting with Major Waddell, as suited her own purposes;
and she dilated so much upon the difficulties and importance
of their votes, and the management that would be requisite
to secure them, that she at last succeeded (no very difficult
matter) in completely mystifying, at least, one of her auditors.
In short, she convinced Lord Rossville, and almost persuaded
his nephew, that the whole issue of the election depended
upon her and her family.
“I have a strange headstrong set of beings to deal with,"
said she ; “but I think, with a little address and a good deal
of attention, we shall prevail at last."
“On such an occasion,” said his lordship, “neither ought
to be wanting, my dear madam. I flatter myself we are
none of us deficient in the former qualification, and the latter
depends entirely upon ourselves. To-morrow, Mr. Delmour
and I shall make a point of waiting upon such of your rela-
tives and connections as”—Mr. Delmour here took out his
memorandum-book, and began to write down the names of
Major Waddell, Mr. Ramsay, and Mr. Black, in his list for
the following day. “I wish we could secure your uncle,"
said he to Mrs. St. Clair ;—then turning to Lord Rossville,
“I find he is the purchaser of the superiorities of Deaf-
knows, which, with Tonglands, and Kilspindie, might, with
ease, be split certainly into four, but I think, probably, into
five, qualifications; these on our side would make it quite a
hollow business—don't you think so ?”.
“Why, in all human probability, it would," replied his
lordship; " at the same time, we must be cautious how we
admit or mistake mere probabilities for absolute certainties-
in all such cases there must ever be contingencics, which it is
impossible, or, at least, extremely difficult, to foresee or guard
against. It is a matter of doubt with me, whether Mr.
Ramsay has yet been infeft in these lands of Kindyford and
Caulfauld, and whether there is not a wadset on the lands of
Ogilface and Haggiescape. In all likelihood, our opponents
are using every means to bring some such corps de reserve
into the field. Also, I understand, there were two new claims
preferred for enrolment on the lands of Stonykirk and Kil-
nettles at the last meeting of freeholders; and we may rea-
sonably conclude, that the roll will be still farther augmented
by the adverse party—that is, if it is possible for them to

91
side, and Colonel Delmour and Mr. Lyndsay at a little dis-
tance, engaged in some debate. Gertrude, on entering, almost
unconsciously seated herself at one of the windows, apart
from everybody; but she was immediately joined by her
cousins. Colonel Delmour remarked, with secret satisfac-
tion, the agitation of her look and manner. He imputed it
entirely to the declaration he had ventured to make, which
he thought had probably given rise to some discussion be-
twixt her mother and her, and which he had no doubt would
end, as all such discussions between mother and daughter
generally do, in favour of the lover.
But this was not precisely the time when he wished his
pretensions to be publicly known—and he was rather desirous
that Miss St. Clair's emotion should pass unobserved.
Colonel Delmour's manner, however, although guarded
and respectful, nevertheless carried with it that nameless
something which made even the object of his professed idola-
try feel he had gained an ascendancy over her, and that the
worshipped was also the worshipper. While he leant on the
back of her chair, Mr. Lyndsay once or twice addressed some
remark to her, but, absent and occupied, she scarcely seemed
to hear him.
“ Is it to-day that you would have me begin to sketch your
portrait ?" said he, with a smile.
* No-not to-day," replied she, in some confusion.
" And why not? To paint from nature, one must take
nature in all her various moods and aspects.'
“But I don't love stormy, cloudy pictures," said Gertrude,
with a sigh.
Colonel Delmour looked reproachfully at her, as he whis-
pered, “Strange, that this day, which has been the brightest
in my life, should seem cloudy to you.-Ah, Gertrudel why
do we not view it with the same eyes ?”
Gertrude blushed deeply, but remained silent.
“What o'clock is it?" inquired Lady Betty.
“ Seven minutes to six,” said Miss Pratt, as she entered,
and, tripping past Lady Betty, joined the group in the win-
dow. Anything new going on here? It's changed days
with you, Colonel, to be in the drawing-room before dinner
-we seldom used to see you till the first course was going
away.” Surveying Gertrude from head to foot, " What's come
over you to-day, my dear? You're not looking like yourself.
I think you've got too many of these passion-flowers in your
head. Mr. Edward, you must not take your cousin's picture
to-day, or else she must part with some of these passion-
flowers; I really don't think they're becoming ; just let me
take out that one--" and she was preparing to lay her

hands upon it, when her's were seized by Colonel Del-
“Bless me, Colonel, don't be so violent ; I'm sure I wasn't
going to take off Miss St. Clair's head ;—they may well be
called passion-flowers, for they really seem to have put yon
in a fine passion-and you've crumpled all my ruff, and
squeezed one of my fingers to the bone.”
Colonel Delmour, colouring a little at the transport of in-
dignation he had given way to, affected to laugh it off, and,
releasing Miss Pratt's hands from his grasp, said in a loud
whisper,-
I beg pardon if, in the ardour of my passion, I did press
your hands too—too tenderly—impute the blame-
“I don't know what you mean, Colonel Delmour," cried
Miss Pratt aloud, as she stroked down her ruft and caressed
her injured finger, with every appearance of ill-humour;
“but I know you've left your marks upon me in a pretty
I didn't know Miss St. Clair's head had been your
property, or, I assure you, I wouldn't have offered to touch
it; but I know if she's wise, she'll take care how she trusts
you with her hand, after seeing how you've used mine," and
she held up a red, angry-looking finger, and shook her ruff-
" and only look at my ruff!"
" What's the matter with your ruff?" asked Lady Betty ;
“it looks very neat, I think.”
“Neat ! it was more than neat, but Colonel Delmour has
spoil'd the seat of it, and I'll have to get it all goffered over
again.” And away walked Miss Pratt and her ruff.
The politicians were now roused at the sound of the gong ;
and as they broke up, Mrs. St. Clair said Lord Rossville,
“Rest assured, my lord, nothing shall be wanting on my
part to gain the suffrages of my family ; and I have little
doubt of accomplishing it, since your lordship has thus kindly
and considerately given me a carte blanche, as it were, for my
actions upon the occasion. I feel most deeply the value of
the confidence you have thus reposed in me.
Lord Rossville had done no such thing, as give, or dream of
giving, Mrs. St. Clair a carte blanche for her actions ; but he
loved to hear himself commended, whether for what he had
done, or for what he had not done, and he therefore allowed
it to pass,
in the belief that he was indeed all that was kind,
wise, and considerate. Gertrude, as a matter of course, was
again placed between Lord Rossville and Mr. Delmour, and
condemned, during a tedious dinner, to hear the same poli-
tical jargon carried on. Mr. Delmour now and then changed
the conversation, indeed, out of compliment to her, and talked
of the views, the weather, the races, and such subjects as he

seemed to think suited to a female capacity; but it was evi-
dently an effort to descend to such things, and Gertrude felt
only provoked that he should even attempt to be agreeable.
When they rose from table, her mother made a sign for her
to follow her to her own room.
CHAPTER XX.
“You are a poor dissembler, Gertrude," said Mrs. St. Clair,
after having shut the door of her chamber, and carefully
examined each lurking recess—" your looks have already be-
trayed to the family that something is wrong—even stupid
Lady Betty asked me at dinner whether you were well enough.
It is, therefore, obvious you are suffering either from mental
disquiet or bodily indisposition, and it must be your part to
play the invalid this evening." Then seeing her daughter
about to express her dislike of the deception, “It is easily
done-you have only to remain here, and leave it to me
to account for your absence in the drawing-room;"—then,
with a profound sigh, “The headache and the heartache are
both mine, God knows! but if you will only affect to bear
the one for me, you will assuredly alleviate the other."
Gertrude felt that she was become a mere tool in her
mother's hands, and that it was in vain to contend. She
therefore yielded a passive assent to remaining a prisoner for
the rest of the evening:
Various were the conjectures, and numberless the remedies,
called forth by Mrs. St. Clair's communication of her
daughter's indisposition. The heat of the day—the drive-
the roads—the dust—the dinner-Uncle Adam and his air-
less room, all these, and many more, were each assigned as
a sufficient cause for headache, and eau de Cologne, aro-
matic vinegar, and all the thousand perfumed specifics, down
to Lady Betty's home-made double-distilled lavender water,
were recommended and accepted. As for Lord Rossville, he
made it quite a matter of life and death. 16 A fever com-
monly began with a headache-was there any disposition to
shivering on the part of the patient ?—any thirst, any fever,
any bile?-how were the eyes, how was the tongue, how
was the pulse ?-A little blood taken in time was perhaps the
most effectual antidote. He possessed some knowledge of
medicine himself-and, in short, Mrs. St. Clair only pre-
vented him from going to prescribe for his niece in person,
by assuring him that she felt a great disposition to sleep, and
had requested that she might not be disturbed. It was there-

fore finally settled, that if Miss St. Clair was no better by to-
morrow morning, she was then to be given up to his lord-
ship's direction.
Colonel Delmour suspected there was some deception in
the case, and was at no loss, as he thought, to fathom the
mystery. He believed their mutual attachment had been
discovered by Mrs. St. Clair, and that Gertrude was suffering
persecution on his account; but he felt little apprehension as
to the result; he knew enough of human nature to be aware,
that, to a romantic ardent nature such as hers, a little oppo-
sition would have rather a good effect, and that there is some-
times no surer way of creating an interest in one party than
by exciting a prejudice in another.
Meanwhile, the object of all this solicitude sat at her
window, watching the coming on of "grateful evening mild."
It was at that lovely season when day and night are so imper-
ceptibly blended into each other, that night seems only a
softer, sweeter day.
But Gertrude was withdrawn from the contemplation of
these consecrated things by the entrance of her mother. She
threw herself on a chair and sighed heavily—then starting
ip, —
“Prepare yourself, Gertrude ; in a few minutes we must
set forth ;-fetch your green travelling cloak, it will com-
pletely cover your dress, and conceal your figure, should we
unfortunately meet any one, which Heaven forbid !"
Gertrude brought her cloak, and did as she was directed,
while her mother wrapt herself in a similar disguise, and
both awaited in trembling expectation the signal for sallying
forth. At length the gong sounded-voices were heard as
the family passed through the hall to the supper-room—the
doors were shut, and all was silent.
"Now is the time," said Mrs. St. Clair, in a voice almost
inarticulate from agitation. “Yet stay-should it by any
unforeseen mischance ever reach Lord Rossville's ears, that
we were seen leaving the house together at such an hour-
no, that will never do—Gertrude, you must go first, and I
will follow."
“O no, no!" cried her daughter, turning pale with terror;
why should that be-surely that can make no difference?"
"Ño difference in reality, but much in appearance,” said
Mrs. St. Clair, impatiently. “Your stealing out to take a
ramble by moonlight, however silly, would not sound very
improbable, and my following you would be perfectly natural;
but both going out together is quite unaccountable, and must
not be: go—make haste."
“Oh, mamma!-do not-I beseech you, do not ask me to

go alone. I cannot-indeed, I cannot;" and she sank upon a
chair.
“Ridiculous!" exclaimed her mother, in a tone of sup-
pressed anger; " of what are you afraid ?”
“I know not-I cannot tell. I am going, I know not where
-to meet, I know not whom-and at midnight. No, I can-
not, I will not go ;” and she threw back her cloak, and shook
off her hat, with gestures of impatience and indignation.
“Obstinate - unfeeling - ungrateful wretch 1" exclaimed
Mrs. St. Clair, giving way to her passion ;
that
I suffer—that I Why do I not give you up to your fate
at once ?-why But I will be obeyed. I command you
on your peril to obey me."
Gertrude threw herself on the floor at her mother's feet.
“Kill me—trample on me,” cried she, in an accent of despair ;
" but my soul revolts from these mysteries.
mother !" continued she in broken accents, “is it you who
command me thus to steal from my uncle's house at midnight
-disguised and alone-to meet a low-born, needy, desperate
Mrs. St. Clair remained silent for a few moments, as if
struggling with her feelings; she then spoke in a voice of
unnatural calmness, -
“Be it so.--My entreaties—my prayers--my commands
are in vain—the die is cast by your hand, and my doom is
fixed. I told you that my life depended upon your unre-
served obedience-and-the forfeit shall be paid."
Gertrude looked on her mother's face-every feature was
convulsed with powerful and fearful emotion: then every
idea vanished but that of her mother dying-dead-and she
the cause. All personal fear-all lofty feeling fled: the right
chord was touched, and her whole frame vibrated with emo-
tion. She clung to her mother's knees—she sued for pardon
-she vowed the most implicit obedience—the most devoted
submission to her will-she called Heaven to witness that
henceforth she would do all that was required of her-she
prayed that she might be tried once, only once more. She
spoke with all the ardour and sincerity of powerful emotion,
but it is not with a throbbing heart and a burning brow that
the mastery
obtained-if vows made in pain are void, those
formed under the influence of excited feeling are no less vain
and fleeting. Mrs. St. Clair's features gradually relaxed,
and, in a more natural voice, she said,
“I forgive you, Gertrude-I forgive your doubts, your
fears, however injurious to me. Go, then-but ere you go,
reflect on what you have undertaken-remember you have
vowed unqualified obedience-there is now no middle course

-you are either my preserver or my destroyer”-she poured
out a glass of water, and held it to her daughter's trembling
lips.—"Now, listen to my instructions :—Glide quickly and
softly along till you reach the south turret stair—be cautious
in descending it, and making your way along the old passage
to the west door, which is seldom locked-when there, you
have only to cross the lawn-keep by the river side, and
wait me at the ivy bridge-fear nothing-I will follow you
immediately.”
Gertrude again muffled herself in her cloak, and, with a
beating heart, went on her way as fast as terror and agitation
would permit. She groped her way down the little turnpike-
stair, and along a dark passage, in an old part of the house,
to a door which opened upon the lawn. But there all things
stood disclosed in the light of a full moon, and calm, cloudless
sky, and her heart almost failed her as she marked her own
dark shapeless shadow stealing along on the silvery path.
She soon gained the bank of the river, and there, in the deep
shade of the rocks and trees, she felt secure, at least from
discovery, if not from danger. A few steps more and she
reached the bridge, where she was to await her mother.
At another time she would have been charmed with the
romantic loveliness and grandeur of the scene.—Rocks, trees,
and waterfall, all gleamed in the pale pellucid light--not a
leaf was stirring, and the solemn stillness was only broken
by the rushing of the river, and the whooping of the owls.
But to enjoy the tranquillity of nature, requires that there
should be some sympathy between the mind and the scene ;
and Gertrude's feelings were but little in unison with the
calm, the holy majesty of moonlight. Scarcely daring to
breathe, every instant seemed an age till she beheld her
mother advance with a quick but agitated step.
“We are late," said she, in a low tone; “let us make
haste;" and taking her daughter's arm, they proceeded
together in silence for a considerable distance, till they came
within sight of a temple situated on the summit of the bank.
“It was there I appointed to meet him," said Mrs. St.
Clair; and as she spoke, the figure of a man was seen
approaching towards them. “Wait here, Gertrude," cried
she, waving her daughter back, as she would have clung to
her. "I shall be within sight and call of you. Do not stir
from hence, and remember your promise."
And disengaging herself from her, she hastily advanced to
meet the stranger. It was not in human nature not to have
felt the most intense curiosity at this moment; and Gertrude
certainly experienced it in no common degree, when she
beheld her mother's meeting with this mysterious man.

Although beyond the reach of hearing what passed, their
gestures told a tale of no common import. After remaining
a few minutes in deep and earnest conversation, she saw Mrs.
St. Clair offer him a packet, which she guessed was the one
containing the money and jewels. She then saw the person
reject it, as if with scorn, and even turn away from it,
as Mrs. St. Clair seemed to press it upon him. This dumb
show lasted some minutes, till at length he snatched it from
the hand she held out to him, and threw it upon the ground,
and made some steps towards the place where Gertrude
stood. Mrs. St. Clair caught him by the arm; she seemed
to be arguing, imploring, supplicating. Now she clasped her
hands, as if in an agony; then she raised them, as if in solemn
appeal to Heaven, and Gertrude caught the sound of her
voice, in tones of the deepest anguish. At length she seemed
to prevail. Having herself lifted up the packet he had
80 contemptuously cast away, she again offered it to him, and
it was accepted. They now advanced together till within a
few paces of Gertrude, when Mrs. St. Clair quitted her com-
panion and approached her daughter. The shade of the
trees covered her face, but her voice was expressive of the
utmost agitation.
“Gertrude, my love," said she in a low tone, “ Lewiston
wishes to see you, to talk with you, as the husband of your
nurse, and a sort of confidential person in the family; he
thinks he has a right to address you in his own way. I dare
not refuse, Gertrude—he will converse with you alone.”
Mrs. St. Clair placed her hand on her daughter's lips, as
she saw an indignant refusal ready to burst forth, -
: “Oh, Gertrudel dearest Gertrude! as you value my life,
as you value your own happiness, do not refuse do not pro-
voke him. I am in his power. One hasty word, one con-
temptuous look, may undo me. Oh, Gertrude ! for the love
you bear to me--for the love you bore your nurse—for the
love of Heaven-be calm and patient. Speak-tell me I
may trust you."
Ånd she led her a few steps towards the stranger. Ger-
trude started with terror, as the moonbeams now fell on her
mother's face, and showed it wild, and even ghastly, from
excessive emotion.
Compose yourself, mamma,” said she ; “I will do—I will
be—all you desire."
There was no time for more, for the stranger, as if impa-
tient of delay, had now joined them; he held out his hand to
Gertrude with an air of familiarity, which at once roused her
indignation, and had almost thrown her off her guard, when
& look from her mother subdued her. · With a blush of

wounded pride, she suffered him to take it, and Mrs. St. Clair
walked apart. He surveyed her for some minutes without
speaking, while her cheek burned, and her heart swelled at
the indignity to which she was thus subjected. At length he
said, abruptly, —
“Do you remember your nurse ?”
" Perfectly."
“How old were you when she died ? "
" I was nine years
old.
" You were very fond of her, were you not ?”
"I loved her as my mother," answered Gertrude, in a voice
of deep emotion.
“ That was well. You are aware that I was her husband ;
consequently, have some claim to a share of your affection.
Do you think you will be able to bestow any of it upon me?”
Gertrude's spirit was ready to burst forth at the insolent
freedom of this address, but she repressed it, and answered
coldly, —
“As the husband of my nurse, I am willing to assist you
as far as I am able, but I have little in my power at present."
“ True ; but the time will come when you will have much.”
“When I have," answered Gertrude, wishing to end the
conference," the claims of my nurse's husband shall not be
forgotten;" and she was moving away.
Stop,” cried he, “not so fast; the claims of
your nurse's
husband are not so easily settled as you seem to suppose. I
wish to put a few more questions to you, young lady, before
we part. How am I to be assured that you will ever have it
in your power to assist me in the world ?"
“I can give you no assurance,” said Gertrude; “ all that I
can say is-if ever it is in my power to befriend you, for the
sake of your wife I shall be ready to do it."
“Only for the sake of my wife !" repeated he, with a smile.
We shall see how that is when the time comes, whether I
shall not have something to say with you for my own sake."
In silent displeasure Gertrude turned proudly away, when
he caught her cloak to detain her.
6. Well, we shall settle that afterwards; but if you play
your cards well, you will one day have something in your
power, or the deuce is in it. The worst of it is, that day may
be a while of coming, and your friends may starve in the mean-
time; but your uncle is a pretty old boy, and you are sure of
succeeding.
Gertrude was choking with indignation, but she remembered
her promise, and remained silent.
“What are your plans for the future?” demanded he,
abruptly.

"I am not in the habit of communicating my plans to
strangers," answered she, haughtily.
“But I have a right to know your plans,” said he, fiercely ;
“I insist upon an answer to my question. What are your
plans for the future ?"
Gertrude was terrified. “I am ignorant of your meaning,"
said she, faintly.
“I mean, in the event of your uncle's death, what would
you do? Would you marry, or remain single ?—and has
your mother attempted to influence you in favour of anybody?
--answer me that --Does she wish you to marry or not?
say
" It is impossible for me to answer. I do not know-I
cannot tell," answered Gertrude, almost overcome with the
contending emotions of terror and indignation.
“Are you sure of that? Is there no Colonel Delmour in
the case, ready to swindle the heiress out of her estates ?-
but that won't do you must beware how you entangle your-
self there--you must beware how you commit yourself-or,
by Jupiter -Come, I must know how the land lies—I
must know how you stand affected to the fortune-hunters
who are looking after you ;” and he would have taken her
hand with an air of familiarity, which now completely threw
her off her guard. Uttering a piercing cry, which echoed
through the woods, she flew wildly past him, and cast herself
into her mother's arms.
CHAPTER XXI.
WHEN Gertrude awoke the following morning from a feverish
and disturbed sleep, her mind, like the broken fragments of a
mirror, presented only disjointed and distorted images, which
she vainly endeavoured to arrange and combine into one con-
nected whole. Hideous dreams were mingled with no less
hideous realities, and confusion only became worse confounded
in the attempt to separate them. At length she opened her
eyes, and beheld her mother sitting by her.
“Oh! mamma," cried she, “speak to me tell me what has
happened-last night-was it-oh! was it all a dream ?"
Compose yourself
, Gertrude," answered Mrs. St. Clair ;
“ whatever it was, it is now past-think of it no more."
* Impossible–I can think of nothing else !-I must know
-I implore you to tell me at least this much-last night,
Mr. Lyndsay-Oh! tell me, did he not rescue me from the
grasp

"Gertrude," interrupted her mother in great agitation,
" of what use is it to talk or think of what is past ?—it is dis-
tressing to yourselt—to me.”
“ It was then even so !-I now remember it all—their
high words—their threatening language—and that man
“ Hush, Gertrude, hush !" again interposed her mother;
you know not what you say."
“ Yes, I know it all; he dared to assert that he had a right
over me-he, the husband of my nurse, to dare to claim a
right over me!" and her voice was almost choked at the
thoughts of having been subjected to such an indignity.
“But, mamma, surely this was—
9—this must have been a
dream-I know it was," and she gasped as she spoke.
“When he appealed to you—you-oh!you said it was so
-1 know I must have dreamt that ;” and she looked wildly
and eagerly in her mother's face; but Mrs. St. Clair remained
silent.
“Oh! you did not-you could not speak of engagements
-of entanglements-of-I know not what-yet strange and
dreadful words of that import still ring in my ears—tell me
-only tell me it is all a dream."
Gertrude, this is agonising to yourself—to me-repress-
in mercy repress those feelings.”
“I will — I will,” cried her daughter, in increasing agita-
“only say you did not so traduce me, as to sanction the
horrible belief, that I could be so base, so vile-oh! how it
degrades me even to utter it—as to have plighted myself to a
menial.”
“ Compose yourself, Gertrude; I cannot talk to you while
you are in this state."
Well, I will-I am composed," making a violent effort to
appear calm, while her frame trembled with the violence of
her emotion—"Now only say, that you, my mother, did not
so calumniate me -but no, you cannot,” cried she, again
giving way to the impetuosity of her feelings—" It is no
dream I heard it all—I heard you-you, my mother, assert
that man had a claim to me, and I believe I was mad at that
moment—did I not throw myself at my cousin's feet, and
implore him to save me-did I not cling to him in agony,
while that man would have torn me from him?"
“ Gertrude, I would have spared you the repetition of your
folly—your madness; I would have spared you the painful
recollection of your broken promise, your injurious distrust
of me; I warned you of the consequences of disregarding my
injunctions, my entreaties, my commands—but all were dis-
regarded; what right have you, then, to upbraid me for hav-
ing told you the truth ?”

“ No, you did not tell me the truth-you did not tell me
you were leading me to insult, to degradation.”
“Say not that I led you: but for your own pride and folly
all would have been well—had you remembered my warning,
and not provoked the person it was your interest as well as
mine to have conciliated, nothing of all this would have hap-
pened ; but your absurd outcry reached Mr. Lyndsay, who
unfortunately had been enticed by the beauty of the night to
take a moonlight ramble, and who hastened to the spot, un-
happily, at the same moment when the other advanced—but
the worst is over. Mr. Lyndsay is a noble-minded, honour-
able man, and we have nothing to fear from him-he has
promised to be for ever silent on the subject.”
“But what-oh! what must he think of me!” exclaimed
Gertrude, in an accent of the deepest dejection.
"Be assured he thinks nothing injurious of you."
" Yet that man dared to assert that my father had given
him a right to me-he, the husband of my nurse !-no, I will
not-I cannot for an instant live under such a sense of degra-
dation-I must seek Mr. Lyndsay-I must tell him it is false !"
And she attempted to rise, but sank back on her pillow over-
whelmed with the force of her emotions.
“For Heaven's sake, Gertrude, do not give way to these
transports !” cried her mother. “Everything is now settled
-the object of your alarm is already many miles distant-
never more, I trust, to return: why then dwell upon what is
past, when it can be productive of no good ? Come, my love,
for my sake try to forget it all."
Forget it!" repeated Gertrude ; "forget that I have been
exposed to insult, to degradation, and by my mother !-that I
never can forget."
“No, do not forget it," cried Mrs. St. Clair, bursting into
tears ;
treasure it in
your
heart's core;
let all my love, and
care, and tenderness be forgotten; let your duty, your obedi-
ence, your promises, be forgotten: but do not forget this one
unfortunate action-record it-proclaim it, and then let me
end a miserable existence. Shall I summon Lord Rossville
and the family,” said she, with affected calmness, putting her
hand to the bell, “ to hear you
denounce
your
mother?
Time had been when this appeal would have produced its
intended effect upon Gertrude; but her feelings had been
already excited to their utmost, and she felt too wretched
herself to have much sympathy to bestow on the author of
her wretchedness; she therefore remained silent. Mrs. St.
Clair repeated the question.
“ I have not deserved this,” replied Gertrude, coldly;

102
THE INHERITANCE.
“ but I am still willing to obey you—what would you have
me do ?"
Mrs. St. Clair embraced her, and would have coaxed and
soothed her,—but she shrunk from these demonstrations
of affection, and again coldly asked what remained for her to
do.
“I would have you appear, if possible, at breakfast, my
love; if you do not, Lord Rossville will insist upon sending
for medical advice, and will make a talk and a bustle about
you, which may excite speculation and surmise, and anything
of that sort had better be avoided at present; you will, there-
fore, oblige me, my dearest, if you will endeavour to look and
be as much yourself as possible; and now I shall leave you
to make your toilette, while I change my dress, for I have not
been in bed all night. I have watched by you, Gertrude, and
that not for the first time."
Gertrude was touched by this proof of her mother's 80-
licitude, and all the recollected proofs of her maternal
anxieties for her in her childish days rushed to her heart,
and with the returning tide brought back something of ten-
derer, kindlier feelings. Yielding, as she always did, to the
impulse of the moment, she received her mother's embrace,
and the scene ended in a reconciliation.
CHAPTER XXII.
Mrs. St. Clair and her daughter descended together to the
breakfast-room ; but at the thoughts of meeting her cousin
after what had so recently occurred, Gertrude's agitation
almost overcame her, and she seated herself at the table
without daring to lift her eyes. Many were the inquiries with
which she was of course assailed, but Miss Prati's observa-
tions, as usual, predominated.
“ I'm afraid, my dear, there's more than a common head-
ache the matter with you; you put me very much in mind of
Anthony Whyte, when he was taking the influenza ; he had
just such a little pink spot on the top of one cheek, and all
the rest of his face as white as the table-cloth; and your
eyes, too, seem very heavy, just like his—he never looked up
for two days.” The little pink spot had gradually increased
with Miss Pratt's remarks ; but making an effort to look up,
Miss St. Clair raised her eyes, and encountered not Mr.
Lyndsay's dreaded gaze, but that of Colonel Delmour, fixed
upon her with anxious scrutiny. Lyndsay was not present,

THE INHERITANCE.
103
nor was there even a place reserved for him. Miss Pratt
seemed to read what was passing in her thoughts.
“So you've lost one of your beaux, you see? Mr. Edward
went off this morning, it seems; it must have been a sudden
thought, for he said nothing of it yesterday; and, by-the-
bye, what became of him at supper last night ? I wonder if
he had a headache, too? they say there's a sympathy in
bodies as well as in minds sometimes ; Colonel Delmour, do
you believe that ?".
“I have heard there is in souls a sympathy with sounds,"
replied Colonel Delmour, with an ironical, contemptuous air ;
“but my soul is, I grieve to say, so lost to all that is edifying
and delightful, it can rarely boast any sympathy with the
sound of Miss Pratt's voice, by which means, unhappily, one
half of her dulcet notes fall powerless on my dull spirit.
May I beg to know what I am called upon to believe ?"
" There's an old saying, Colonel, that there's none so deaf
as them who won't hear, and I suspect that's your case some-
times,” retorted Miss Pratt, in a very toothy manner, though
affecting to turn the laugh against her opponent. The
entrance of the post-bag here attracted Miss Pratt's atten-
tion. It was Lord Rossville's enviable prerogative to open it
himself, and to dole out the letters in the most cautious and
deliberate manner to their respective destinations—a measure
which
very
ill accorded with the mercurial powers of Miss
Pratt, who, in spite of his lordship's precautions in holding
the mouth of the bag as close as he possibly could, always
contrived to dart her eyes down to the very bottom of it, and
to anticipate its contents long ere the moment of delivery
arrived. Like all weak important people, Lord Rossville
loved power in any form or substance in which it presented
itself, even in that of a leather bag, which he grasped with
the air of a Jupiter holding his thunderbolt, and lingered
over it as though it had been another Pandora's box. Al-
though his lordship, for upwards of forty years, had been in
the daily, nay hourly, practice of declaring that he would not
be hurried, that he would take his own time, &c., &c., never-
theless, in the very teeth of this assurance, Miss Pratt did
still persist in her attempts to accelerate the Earl's move-
ments, which, of course, had invariably the effect of pro-
tracting them. On the present occasion, it seemed doubtful
whether the letters were ever to see the light, as, upon Miss
Pratt remarking, that it would be much better if there was
no bag at all, for then people would get their letters at once,
without being kept on the tenter-hooks this way, his lord-
ship closed its mouth, and, opening his own, commenced a
very elaborate harangue on the impropriety, irregularity, and

inconvenience of such a mode of proceeding. Meanwhile,
Gertrude gradually regained her composure, and was even
able to receive Colonel Delmour's assiduities with something
like pleasure. At length, Miss Pratt having knocked under,
for, as she observed, in an underhand way, there was no dis-
puting with a man who held the key of the post-bag, the
contents were duly distributed, and she received her portion,
which kept her silent for a few minutes.
Gertrude trembled as a letter was handed to her, but her
alarm subsided when she saw it was directed in a feeble,
affected-looking female hand, and sealed with a fat bouncing
heart, skewered with an arrow, motto, “La peine est douce."
The contents corresponded with these exterior symbols, and
were as follows:-
“ Bellevue, July
“ MA CHERE COUSINE,
“ From what passed in your presence,
you will, I suspect, not be very much surprised to hear that
à certain person, who shall be nameless, has carried his point,
and that I have at length been prevailed upon to name
Thursday next as the day when I am to enter upon a new
state of existence. Eh bien! my dear coz, I hope your time
is coming, and when it does, most fervently do I pray that
you may prove as fortunate in your choice as I have done in
mine. The Major is indeed all that I could wish-far, very
far, beyond my poor deserts; and I should consider myself as
the most ungrateful of women, if I did not look upon myself
as the most fortunate of my sex! That being the case,
I cer-
tainly feel less than I should otherwise do at taking this most
important and solemn step;, but the certainty that I am
bestowing myself upon one who is in every respect worthy of
my warmest admiration, esteem, and affection, supports me,
and be assured, my dear cousin, it is the only thing that can
support the spirits at such a time. How much, alas! are they
to be pitied who do not possess that certainty, without which,
believe me, all the advantages of birth and fortune are
nothing—for without that, I assure you, the Major's rank,
fortune, connections, manners, &c., &c., never would have in-
fluenced me. Such being the state of affairs here at present,
I am very desirous that you, ma chere cousine, should par-
ticipate in my feelings, and also take a lesson for what, rest
assured, will one day be your own fate; I, therefore, request,
as a particular favour, that you will give us the pleasure of
your company to pass the intervening days with me, and to
officiate as bride's-maid upon a certain occasion. The Major
unites with me in this request, so it will be a double disap-

pointment if anything should prevent you. Papa and mamma
also join in the wish that my nuptials should be graced with
your presence. The Major offered to drive down for you any
day in the gig—(apropos, I must tell you he admires you very
much, but I am not jealous :)—but I own at present, I think
that would be making the thing rather public, and besides,
shall I confess my weakness ?-I feel particularly timid at the
thoughts of the Major risking himself in a gig at present :
only conceive my situation, if anything should happen to
him!!! I trust you will be at no loss for an opportunity, and
that I shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you here, and of
making you better acquainted with my lord and master to be.
Adio mia cara,
" ISABELLA.
“Pray, have you heard any more of your beau ? The
Major thinks he must be a spy.
" I. C. B.
“ Excuse haste; but the Major is sitting by me, and
says
he
is ready to quarrel with you for engrossing so much of my
time.
"I. C. B."
In great disgust at the vulgar, affected familiarity of this
performance, Gertrude handed it to her mother in silence,
resolved in her own mind to return a brief denial to Miss
Bell's invitation. Not so Mrs. St. Clair, who thought nothing
could be more apropos than this proposal. She was desirous
of removing her daughter from the observation of the family,
until her mind should have regained its usual tone, and she
knew nothing would be so likely to affect that as change of
scene, and necessity of exertion. It would require a little
management, perhaps, to obtain Lord Rossville's consent,
but, in the present state of affairs, that would be easily
obtained ; and having settled all this, she put the letter in her
reticule, with an air that said, this requires consideration.
Miss Pratt now made known the contents of her despatch,
which was a pressing invitation to spend a few days at old
Lady M'Caw's, to meet Mrs. Chatwell and the Miss Know-
alls—just a nice little female party. It was a pleasant thing
for old friends to meet, and talk over old stories now and
then, &c., &c.
So, Miss Pratt, we are going to lose you then, it seems ? '
said the Earl, in an accent of agreeable surprise, and a visage
beaming with delight.
“ Indeed, it's not very well bred, my lord, to run away in

THE INHERITANCE.
this manner,” replied Miss Pratt; “but it's an old promise
of mine to Lady M'Caw, honest woman, and I would not like
to disappoint her, especially as she is so good as say she'll
send the carriage for me to-morrow morning. However, I
shall make out my visit to you yet; and if I can get hold
of Anthony Whyte, will bring him with me.
Lord Rossville's countenance fell at this assurance. He had
been anxiously waiting the termination of Miss Pratt's visit,
that he might give a dinner to some of the stateliest of the
neighbouring grandees; a thing which could not be got up
with good effect while that lady was his guest. Her light
frothy babbles disconcerted his heavy sonorous speeches; her
brisk familiarity detracted from the dignity of his manner ;-
it was as impossible for him to be the dignified nobleman,
with Miss Pratt at his elbow, as it would have been with an
apc on his shoulder. However, it was a great point gained
to have got her fairly off the field, and he flattered himself,
with a little management, he might contrive to exclude her
till it suited his time to receive her again. Contrary to his
usual practice, but in conformity with the vulgar proverb, he
therefore resolved to make hay while the sun shone, and
straightway set about issuing his cards immediately. In this
complacent mood, Mrs. St. Clair found little difficulty in ob-
taining his consent to Gertrude's visit to Bellevue, which she
took care to insinuate would prove highly advantageous, in
a political point of view ;-a bait which the Earl instantly
caught at. He even declared his intention, and that of Mr.
Delmour, to pay their respects to the worthy family at Belle-
vue the following day; and finally, it was settled that they
should accompany Mrs. and Miss St. Clair there, leaving the
latter to officiate at her cousin's nuptials ;-an office which, in
the present state of the political contest, was not deemed
derogatory, even for the heiress presumptive of Rossville.
Colonel Delmour seemed somewhat chagrined at first
hearing of this arrangement; but, upon reflection, he began
to discover that it might rather advance his purpose, to have
the object of his pursuit withdrawn for a while from the
watchful eyes of her guardians; and he secretly resolved to
be a daily visitor at Bellevue while she remained. As for
Gertrude, whatever repugnance she felt at first to the propo-
sal, she soon yielded to her mother's solicitations, for she was
a stranger to that selfishness which is obstinate in trifles.
Miss Pratt's departure was hailed as a joyful release by the
whole party, with the exception, indeed, of Lady Betty and
Mr. Delmour. The one was too stupid, and the other too much
engrossed, to have any discrimination in their choice of com-
pany ;--with the one, words were words, and Miss Pratt's

107
words were as good, if not better, than other people's words;
- with the other, Miss Pratt was Miss Pratt, and one Miss
was very much like another during a contested election.
CHAPTER XXIII.
The whole Black family were evidently prepared for the re-
ception of their visitors; and as they were all good-looking,
and well-dressed, the tout ensemble' was highly prepos-
sessing. Indeed, had it been otherwise, they would still have
found favour in the eyes of Lord Rossville and his nephew,
who, in each and all of the human beings now assembled,
even to the baby, beheld simply a vote or the article or par-
ticle of a vote. The Earl, therefore, parsed and prosed away
to good Mrs. Black, who sat listening to him with the most
perfect reverence and admiration. Had the speaker been
their neighbour old Mr Longlungs, she might perhaps have
thought him rather long-winded; but it was still the golden
age of innocence with Mrs. Black, for it never once occurred
to her that it was possible for an Earl to be as tiresome as a
commoner. She, therefore, hung enamoured on his lord-
ships accents; but when he condescended so far as to take
one of the children on his knee, and to drink the healths of
the whole family in what he declared to be the very best
Malmsey Madeira he had ever tasted, the conquest of Mrs.
Black was completed ; and she secretly vowed in her heart,
that she would never rest night or day, till, by hook or by
crook, she had secured Mr. Black's vote for him. And then,
as he seemed so taken with them all, there was no saying but
he might get a company for Bob, and give his business to
Davy. And with these splendid visions,
Mrs. Black's comely
good-humoured face beamed upon the Earl with an expres-
sion he was little accustomed to on the countenances of his
auditors.
Mr. Delmour, on his part, was not idle, having talked very
sensibly with Mr. Black on
“ Russet lawns and fallows gray,
Where the nibbling flocks do stray;"
that is, in plain prose, on the rearing and feeding of cattle,
succession of crops, &c., &c. He next addressed himself to a
very, prety particle of a vote in the person of Miss Lilly
Black, who had made some faint and inefficient attempts to
discover whether be wrote poetry-till, growing bolder as she

advanced, she at length popped the question, whether he
would not write something in her Album. Mr. Delmour pro-
tested, with the most perfect truth, that he never had written
a verse in his life ; but to soften the disappointment, added,
with a bow and most expressive look, that if ever he was to
be so inspired, it must be on the present occasion. Miss
Lilly blushed, and had no doubt that Mr. Delmour was over
head and ears in love with her already; and having read
every novel in the circulating library at Barnford, Miss Lilly
was ready to be fallen in love with at a moment's warning.
Mrs. Major Waddell to be, was the only one of the family
then at home who did not appear. She said that, in her
situation, it was extremely unpleasant to be stared at by
strangers, and as Lord Rossville and Mr. Delmour must
know
perfectly well how she was situated, they would easily
understand her reasons for declining all introductions in her
present situation.
Miss Bell, however, secretly flattered
herself that her absence would be too striking to be passed
over in silence, and that Lord Rossville would make a point
of seeing her: great was her mortification, therefore, when
the whole party drove off, with the exception of Gertrude,
who was left behind. The bride-elect descended to the
drawing-room, in hopes of hearing that the Major and she
had formed the principal subject of conversation; but there
she found Mrs. Black trying to remember all that Lord Ross-
ville had said about the line of the New Canal, and Mr.
Black already anticipating the arrival of a couple of pure
merinos, which Mr. Delmour was to procure for him from
his uncle the Duke of Burlington ; Miss Lilly was expressing
her wonder to Miss St. Clair, whether it was really true that
Mr. Delmour did not write poetry ; and the children were
squabbling over the remains of the cake.
"I hope there was no particular allusion to the Major and
me," said Miss Bell, seeing it in vain to wait for any volun-
tary communication ; “in my situation such things are not
very pleasant."
• There was no mention made of you whatever, Bell," was
the reply.
“I assure you I'm very happy to hear it,” said Miss Bell,
in evident displeasure, to which she could only give vent by
turning the children out of the room for making a noise,
which they, of course, redoubled outside the door, till
dragged shrieking away by their maid.
Miss St. Clair already felt the discomforts of her situation
-seated in a dressed drawing-room for the day, with Mrs.
Black and her daughters, who seemed to have renounced all
occupation for that of being company to their guest and

“ labour dire it is and weary woc," in such cases, whether to
the entertainer or the entertained.
The following day brought Colonel Delmour, and Ger-
trude watched, with some solicitude, the effect her relations
would produce upon him. But he was upon his guard, and
none but a nice observer could have detected supercilious
contempt in the lofty ease of his manner. But there is an
ease, which causes only constraint in the minds of others,
and such was Colonel Delmour's. He was much too elegant
and high bred to have anything of the familiar ease, so often
a concomitant of the vulgar—but he had as little of that
open simplicity of manner, which is the characteristic of a
noble, ingenuous mind. It was that sort of ease which im-
plies conscious superiority in its possessor, and consequently
produces the opposite feeling in those less-gifted mortals with
whom it comes in contact. Such was the sort of undefinable
sensation it created in the Black family from the eldest to the
youngest.
Simple Mrs. Black's profound and earnest inquiries after
Lord Rossville-her hopes that he had not been the worse of
his ride-that he had got home before the hearty shower, &c.,
&c., were all answered in a general way, and with an air of
indifference, which, as Mrs. Black afterwards declared, said
very little for his natural affection. Even Miss Bell had an
instinctive feeling, that her airs would be all thrown away
upon him, and though she did drop her carbuncle brooch (a
present from the Major) upon the carpet, Colonel Delmour
never so much as moved his chair or assisted in looking for
it; while Miss Lilly turned over her Album in vain, and in
answer to her usual question of whether he was fond of
poetry, he returned so brief and decided a negative as put a
complete stop to all proceedings on that subject. The only
one who made no attempts at display was the third daughter,
Anne, a sensible, mild-looking girl, who, from her quiet, un-
obtrusive manners, was generally overlooked, and who now
pursued her work in her usual calm way, careless alike of
notice or neglect.
Colonel Delmour certainly was at no pains to gain the good
graces of the family. He saw at once they were not the
sort of people likely to acquire any influence over Miss St.
Clair, consequently he had no motive make him to in-
gratiate himself with them. And to have been at the trouble
of making the agreeable to such a set of plebeians, would have
required some very strong stimulus to one whose ruling
principle was selfishness, and who never cared to please,
unless to serve his own purpose. He stayed long in hopes
Mrs. Black and her daughters would have had the tact to
discover that they were great bores in their own house-but

he is
no such discovery was made ; on the contrary, Mrs. Black
redoubled her efforts to entertain her visitor-she made many
apologies for Mr. Black being from home, and asked Beil
what had come over the Major-just as the Major entered.
The case was now desperate-scarcely able to conceal his ill-
humour, he merely noticed the introduction of Major Wad-
dell by a slight and somewhat haughty bow, and took his
leave.
“Well, cousin,” cried Miss Bell, as he drove off, “I
really cannot say a great deal for your Colonel ; I think I
never saw so ill-bred a man.'
“I can't just say that, Bell,” said her mother.
6. I'm
sure he was nowise indiscreet, and we must make allowance
for him, for you know we were all strangers to him, and, I
dare say, he was just a little shy and strange at first—but
that'll wear off.”
“It's the oddest thing that he should not like poetry,"
said Miss Lilly, “ for he is so handsome.”
“I don't think much of his looks," said Miss Bell ;
a great deal too tall," eyeing the Major, who was the Apollo
Belvidere in her opinion, and who was, at least, a head
shorter.
“ I think our Bob must be as tall by this time," said Mrs.
Black; “but I wish he may have taken the breadth with
him, poor fellow.”
" I don't think he has the manners of a man who has seen
much of the world,” resumed Miss Bell again, looking at her
lover; “no general conversation-has he ever been abroad,
I wonder ?"
“Come, now," said the Major, turning up his bronzed
visage, gilded with a strong yellow beam of delight; "are
you not rather too severe ? Colonel Delmour is surely a
fine-looking man, and much admired, understand, by the
ladies."
" I beg you will make some exceptions, Major-but, per-
haps, I have a very bad taste," with a conscious smile.
ī I'm afraid you have, indeed,” returned the Major, with a
laugh of perfect ecstacy. “I'm very much afraid of it, in-
deed. What do you say to that, Mrs. Black ? Miss St. Clair,
don't you think
your cousin discovers a very bad taste in her
choice of some things ?”
Gertrude felt too much disgusted with the vulgarity and
ill-breeding of her relations to be able to reply ; indeed, the
only one she could with truth have made, must have been a
cordial assent, and she recoiled from their familiarity with a
hauteur foreign to her nature. Mrs. Black observed her
displeasure, but mistook the cause.
* You must excuse our freedom, my dear,” said she ; " but

you see we make no stranger of you-we just look upon you
as one of ourselves, and forget sometimes that your friends
and relations are not ours: but there's one thing I can tell
you,"
," continued she, with a significant smile and a half
whisper, “that though the Colonel's not just so taking as his
brother, we all think a great deal of him, and are all much
pleased to think, that -you know"-and Mrs. Black smiled
still more significantly. “I assure you, Mr. Black thinks a
great deal of him; he says he's really a pleasant, sensible,
gentlemanly, well-informed young man."
Still Gertrude's countenance did not clear up, to Mrs.
Black's great surprise ; for, like many other excellent wives,
she thought her husband's opinion carried the greatest possi-
ble weight with it, and that Miss St. Clair must needs be
much flattered to hear that her intended was so much ap-
proved of by Mr. Black. For the Earl, to advance his
favourite political schemes, had dropped some ambiguous
mysterious hints of the projected alliance between his nephew
and niece, which Mrs. Black had easily manufactured into an
approaching marriage. Rather at a loss what to make of Miss
St. Clair, and the coolness with which she listened to the
praises of her supposed lover, Mrs. Black now proposed that
the young people should take a walk and show their cousin
something of Bellevue—there was the burn, and the Hawk-
hill, and the new plantation, and there was the poultry-yard
--if Miss Gertrude was fond of poultry, the Bellevue poultry
were reckoned the finest in the country side ; and loaded
with Mrs. Black's directions and suggestions, the party set
forth. No party, perhaps, ever set out upon a walk without
some difference of opinion as to the road to be taken; but
on the present occasion the matter was soon settled by Miss
Bell, who remarked to the Major, that it was so long since
she had seen his sister, Mrs. Fairbairn, that, if her cousin
had no objections, she should like much to walk as far as the
Holm.
“I have not seen your sweet little namesake, Major, since
he has had the measles, and I quite long to see him, dear
little fellow I and although it is an understood thing," address-
ing Gertrude, “that, in my situation, I go nowhere, yet the
Major's sister, you know, is an exception, and she is such a
sweet domestic woman she scarcely ever stirs from home-it
is quite a treat to see Mr. and Mrs. Fairbairn in their own
family-it is really a beautiful sight."
The Major was, of course, all joy and gratitude for this
proposal, and highly flattered by the interest expressed for
his little name-son in particular, and the eulogy bestowed on
the family in general. As for Gertrude she cared little

where she went. When people are uncomfortable they
flatter themselves any change must be for the better, and
there is relief even in variety of wretchedness. Forward,
then, they set for the Holm.
The road was not of the most picturesque description; but,
indeed, it would not have been
easy to have found any such
in the environs of Bellevue. But, at length, after skirting
many a well-dressed field, covered with flourishing crops of
oats, pease, beans, potatoes, &c., they entered upon the sheep
farm, which, although it had nothing of the romantic or
beautiful to charm the eye, yet, like all spots of unsophisti-
cated nature, was not without attractions to those who love
nature even in her simplest scenes.
The ground was hilly, covered with a carpet of close,
short, sweet herbage, except here and there, where still re-
mained patches of heath and broom, or a whin bush and a
wild rose scented the breeze, their prickly stems decked with
“ small woolly tufts, spoils of the vagrant lamb."
The air was pure and fresh, "nimble and sweet," and
Gertrude stood inhaling it with delight, as she felt her
spirits rise under its exhilarating influence. The Major and
Miss Bell had walked on before, Miss Lilly had left the
party for higher ground, which commanded a view of the
county town where Lieutenant O'Brien was quartered, and
Gertrude, to her great relief, was left alone with her cousin
Anne.
“ If there were but deer bounding instead of sheep bleat-
ing here," said she, “I could fancy myself upon the very
• Braes o' Balquither,' which you were singing about last
night ;" and she hummed the air.
« Ah !” said her companion in a mournful tone, “if po-
verty were there represented as it is in reality, this world
would be a paradise, and we might all be happy.
"So, then, you think poverty the only evil in life ?" asked
Miss St. Clair.
“No. I spoke idly-not the only one-but," she blushed,
and the tears stood in her eyes, as in a low voice she added,
" but the only one I have ever known;" then, as if ashamed
of having said so much, she turned away her head.
For a moment Gertrude was at a loss to understand her
cousin's meaning ; but it presently struck her that she must
have formed some attachment where poverty was the obsta-
cle; and she would have continued the conversation in hopes
of gaining her confidence, but at that moment the Major and
Miss Bell, having retraced their steps in search of their
companions, interposed.
“We thought we had lost you!" exclaimed the lady.
6

“Major, will you give my cousin your other arm ? the descent
is very steep now.”
Gertrude declined the proffered aid, which she thought
more likely to encumber than accelerate her movements ;
and, besides, she wished to renew the conversation with Anne,
but in vain. The lovers, having exhausted their silly talk for
the present, were now glad of a little variety, and they kept
all close together till they reached the Holm.
CHAPTER XXIV.
The first appearance of the Holm was highly prepossessing.
It was a large, handsome-looking house, situated in a well-
wooded park, by the side of a broad placid river, and an air
of seclusion and stillness reigned all round, which impressed
the mind with images of peace and repose. The interior of
the house was no less promising—there was a spacious hall
and a handsome staircase, with all appliances to boot—but as
they approached the drawing-room all the luxurious indo-
lence of thought, inspired by the tranquillity of the scenery,
was quickly dispelled by the discordant sounds which issued
from thence, and, when the door was thrown open, the foot-
man in vain attempted to announce the visitors. In the mid-
dle of the room all the chairs were collected to form a coach
and horses for the Masters and Misses Fairbairn. One
unruly-looking urchin sat in front, cracking a long whip
with all his might-another acted as guard behind, and blew
a shrill trumpet with all his strength-while a third, in a
nightcap and flannel lappet, who had somewhat the air of
having quarrelled with the rest of the party, paraded up and
down, in solitary majesty, beating a drum. On a sofa sat
Mrs. Fairbairn, a soft, fair, genteel-looking woman, with a
crying child of about three years old at her side, tearing
paper into shreds, seemingly for the delight of littering the
carpet, which was already strewed with headless dolls, tail-
less horses, wheelless carts, &c. As she rose to receive her
visitors it began to scream.
“ I'm not going away, Charlotte, love--don't be frightened,"
said the fond mother, with a look of ineffable pleasure.
“ You no get up-you shan't get up,” screamed Charlotte,
seizing her mother's gown fiercely to detain her.
“My darling, you'll surely let me go to speak to uncle-
good uncle, who brings you pretty things, you know;" but
during this colloquy uncle and the ladies had made their way
to the enthralled mother, and the bustle of a meeting and

introduction was got over. Chairs were obtained by the
footman with some difficulty, and placed as close to the mis-
tress of the house as possible, aware that otherwise it would
not be easy to carry on even question and answer amid the
tumult that reigned.
“You find us rather noisy, I am afraid," said Mrs. Fair-
bairn with a smile, and in a manner which evidently meant
the reverse ;
“but this is Saturday, and the children are all
in such spirits, and they won't stay away from me. Henry,
my dear, don't crack your whip quite so loud, there's a good
boy; that's a new whip his papa brought him from London,
and he's so proud of it! William, my darling, don't you
think
your drum must be tired now? If I were you I would
give it a rest. Alexander, your trumpet makes rather too
much noise-one of these ladies has got a headache-wait
till you go out—there's my good boy, and then you'll blow it
at the cows and the sheep, you know, and frighten them,
Oh! how you'll frighten them with it !"
“No, I'll not blow it at the cows; I'll blow it at the horses,
because then they'll think it's the mail-coach.” And he was
running off when Henry jumped down from the coach-box.
“No, but you shan't frighten them with your trumpet, for I
shall frighten them with my whip. Mamma, aren't horses
best frightened with a whip?” and a struggle ensued.
Well, don't fight, my dears, and you shall both frighten
them," cried their mamma.
“No, I'm determined he shan't frighten them ; I shall do
it,” cried both together as they rushed out of the room, and
the drummer was preparing to follow.
“ William, my darling, don't you go after these naughty
boys; you know they're always very bad to you. You know
they wouldn't let you into their coach with your drum.”
Here William began to cry. “Well, never mind, you shall
have a coach of your own—a much finer coach than theirs ; I
wouldn't go into their ugly dirty coach ; and you shall have
Here something of a consolatory nature was whis-
pered, William was comforted, and even prevailed upon to
relinquish his drum for his mamma's ivory work-box, the con-
tents of which were soon scattered on the floor."
“These boys are gone without their hats,” cried Mrs.
Fairbairn, in a tone of distress. “Eliza, my dear, pull the
bell for Sally to get the boys' hats.”—Sally being despatched
with the hats, something like a calm ensued, in the absence
of he of the whip and the trumpet; but as it will be of short
duration, it is necessary to take advantage of it in improving
the introduction into an acquaintance with the Fairbairn
family,

Mrs. Fairbairn was one of those ladies, who, from the
time she became a mother, ceased to be anything else. All
the duties, pleasures, charities, and decencies of life, were
henceforth concentrated in that one grand characteristic;
every object in life was henceforth viewed through that
single medium. Her own mother was no longer her mother;
she was the grandmamma of her dear infants, her brothers
and sisters were mere uncles and aunts, and even her hus-
band ceased to be thought of as her husband from the time
he became a father. He was no longer the being who had
claims on her time, her thoughts, her talents, her affections ;
he was simply Mr. Fairbairn, the noun masculine of Mrs.
Fairbairn, and the father of her children. Happily for Mr.
Fairbairn, he was not a person of very nice feelings, or re-
fined taste; and although, at first, he did feel a little un-
pleasant when he saw how much his children were preferred
to himself, yet, in time, he became accustomed to it, then
came to look upon Mrs. Fairbairn as the most exemplary of
mothers, and finally resolved himself into the father of a very
fine family, of which Mrs. Fairbairn was the mother. In all
this there was more of selfish egotism, and animal instinct,
than of rational affection, or Christian principle; but both
parents piqued themselves upon their fondness for their off-
spring, as if it were a feeling peculiar to themselves, and not
one they shared in common with the lowest and weakest of
their species. Like them, too, it was upon the bodies of
their children that they lavished their chief care and tender-
ness, for, as to the immortal interests of their souls, or the
cultivation of their minds, or the improvement of their
tempers, these were but little attended to, at least in compa-
rison of their health and personal appearance.
: Alas! if there be “not a gem so precious as the human
soul,” how often do these gems seem as pearls cast before
swine ; for how seldom is it that a parent's greatest care is
for the immortal happiness of that being whose precarious,
and at best transient, existence engrosses
their every thought
and desire! But, perhaps, Mrs. Fairbairn, like many a foolish
ignorant mother, did her best, and had she been satisfied with
spoiling her children herself for her own private amusement,
and not have drawn in her visitors and acquaintances to share
in it, the evil might have passed uncensured. But Mrs.
Fairbairn, instead of shutting herself up in her nursery,
chose to bring her nursery down to her drawing-room, and
instead of modestly denying her friends an entrance into her
purgatory, she had a foolish pride in showing herself in the
midst of her angels. In short, as the best things, when cor-
rupted, always become the worst, so the purest and tenderest

of human affections, when thus debased by selfishness and
egotism, turn to the most tiresome and ridiculous of human
weaknesses,-a truth but too well exemplified by Mrs. Fair-
bairn.
“I have been much to blame," said she, addressing Miss
Bell, in a soft, whining, sick-child sort of voice, “for not
having been at Bellevue long ago; but dear little Charlotte
has been so plagued with her teeth, I could not think of
leaving her-for she is so fond of me, she will go to nobody
else ; she scrcams when her maid offers to take her-and she
won't even go to her papa.
“Is that possible?" said the Major.
“I assure you it's very true-she's a very naughty girl
sometimes,” bestowing a long and rapturous kiss on the child.
“Who was it that beat poor papa for taking her from mamma
last night ? Well, don't cry—no, no, it wasn't my Charlotte.
- She knows every word that's said to her, and did from the
time she was only a year old.”
“That is wonderful !” said Miss Bell ; “but how is my
little favourite Andrew ?"
“He is not very stout yet, poor little fellow, and we must
be very careful of him.” Then turning to Miss St. Clair, “ Our
little Andrew has had the measles, and you know the dregs
of the measles are a serious thing—much worse than the
measles themselves. Andrew-Andrew Waddell, my love,
come here and speak to the ladies.” And thereupon Andrew
Waddell, in a nightcap, riding on a stick, drew near. Being
the Major's namesake, Miss Bell, in the ardour of her attach-
ment, thought proper to coax Andrew Waddell on her knee,
and even to open her watch for his entertainment.
“Ah! I see who spoils Andrew Waddell,” cried the de-
lighted mother.
The Major chuckled, Miss Bell disclaimed, and for the
time Andrew Waddell became the hero of the piece ; the
blains of the measles were carefully pointed out, and all his
sufferings and sayings duly recapitulated. At length Miss
Charlotte, indignant at finding herself eclipsed, began to
scream and cry with all her strength.
" It's her teeth, darling little thing," said her mother,
caressing her.
“I'm sure it's her teeth, sweet little dear,” said Miss Bell.
“It undoubtedly must be her teeth, poor little girl," said
the Major.
“ If you will feel her gum," said Mrs. Fairbairn, putting
her own finger into the child's mouth, “ you will feel how
hot it is."
This was addressed in a sort of general way to the com-

117
66
pany, none of whom seemed eager to avail themselves of the
privilege, till the Major stepped forward, and having with his
fore-finger made the circuit of Miss Charlotte's mouth, gave
it as his decided opinion, that there was a tooth actually cut-
ting the skin. Miss Bell followed the same course, and con-
firmed the interesting fact-adding, that it appeared to her to
be 66 an uncommon large tooth."
At that moment Mr. Fairbairn entered, bearing in his arms
another of the fanıily, a fat, sour, new-waked-looking crea-
ture, sucking its finger. Scarcely was the introduction over
" There's a pair of legs !” exclaimed he, holding out a pair
of thick purple stumps with red worsted shoes at the end of
them. "I don't suppose Miss St. Clair ever saw legs like
these in France; these are porridge and milk legs, are they
not, Bobby?"
But Bobby continued to chew the cud of his own thumb in
solemn silence.
“Will you speak to me, Bobby ?" said Miss Bell, bent
upon being amiable and agreeable; but still Bobby was
mute.
“We think this little fellow rather long of speaking,"
said Mr. Fairbairn; we allege that his legs have ran away
with his tongue.'
6. How old is he?" asked the Major.
“He is only nineteen months and ten days," answered his
mother, “
so he has not lost much time; but I would rather
see a child fat and thriving, than have it very
forward."
“No comparison !" was here uttered in a breath by the
Major and Miss Bell.
There's a great difference in children in their time of
speaking," said the mamma. “ Alexander didn't speak till
he was two and a quarter; and Henry, again, had a great
many little words before he was seventeen months; and
Eliza and Charlotte both said mamma as plain as I do at a
year; ; but girls always speak sooner than boys; as for Wil-
liam Pitt and Andrew Waddell, the twins, they both suffered
so much from their teething, that they were longer of speak-
ing than they would otherwise have been-indeed, I never
saw an infant euffer so much as Andrew Waddell did he had
greatly the heels of William Pitt at one time, till the measles
pulled him down.”
A movement was here made by the visitors to depart.
"O! you mustn't go without seeing the baby," cried Mrs.
Fairbairn; “Mr. Fairbairn, will you pull the bell twice for
baby ?"
The bell was twice rung, but no baby answered the
summons.

THE INHERITANCE,
“She must be asleep," said Mrs. Fairbairn; "but I will
take you up to the nursery, and you will see her in her
cradle." And Mrs. Fairbairn led the way to the nursery,
and opened the shutter, and uncovered the cradle, and dig-
played the baby.
• Just five months-uncommon fine child-the image of
Mr. Fairbairn-fat little thing-neat little hands-sweet little
mouth-pretty little nose-nice little toes,” &c., &c., &c.,
were as usual whispered over it.
Miss St. Clair flattered herself the exhibition was now
over, and was again taking leave, when, to her dismay, the
squires of the whip and the trumpet rushed in, proclaiming
that it was pouring of rain! To leave the house was impos-
sible, and, as it was getting late, there was nothing for it but
staying dinner.
The children of this happy family always dined at table,
and their food and manner of eating were the only subjects
of conversation. Alexander did not like mashed potatoes,
and Andrew Waddell could not eat broth, and Eliza could
live upon fish, and William Pitt took too much small-beer,
and Henry ate as much meat as his papa, and all these
peculiarities had descended to them from some one or other
of their ancestors. The dinner was simple on account of the
children, and there was no dessert, as Bobby did not agree
with fruit. But to make amends, Eliza's sampler was shown,
and Henry and Alexander's copy-books were handed round
the table, and Andrew Waddell stood up and repeated “My
name is Norval” from beginning to end, and William Pitt
was prevailed upon to sing the whole of “God save the
King” in a little squeaking mealy voice, and was bravoed and
applauded as though he had been Braham himself.
To paint a scene in itself so tiresome is doubtless but a
poor amusement to my reader, who must often have endured
similar persecution ; for, who has not suffered from the
obtrusive fondness of parents for their offspring ? and who
has not felt what it was to be called upon, in the course of a
morning visit, to enter into all the joys and the sorrows of the
nursery, and to take a lively interest in all the feats and
peculiarities of the family? Shakspeare's anathema against
those who hated music is scarcely too strong to be applied to:
those who dislike children. There is much enjoyment some-
times in making acquaintance with the little beings, much
delight in hearing their artless unsophisticated prattle, and
something not unplcasing even in witnessing their little freaks
and wayward humours; but when a tiresome mother, instead
of allowing the company to notice her child, torments every
ons to death in forcing or coaxing her child to notice the com-

pany, the charm is gone, and we experience only disgust or
ennui.
Mr. and Mrs. Fairbairn pursued to its utmost extent this
fatal rock on which so many parents make shipwreck of their
senses; and so satisfied were they with themselves and their
children, so impressed with the idea of the delights of their
family scenes, that vain would have been any attempt to open
the eyes of their understanding. Perhaps the only remedy
would have been found in that blessed spirit which “vaunteth
pot itself, and seeketh not its own.”
The evening proved fine, and Gertrude rejoiced to return
even to Bellevue.
CHAPTER XXV.
The day previous to the marriage, the bustle that reigned in
and around Bellevue was increased to that intense degree
which attends all great events as they approach towards their
consummation. Uncle Adam, Miss Black, and Mr. and Mrs.
Fairbairn, were expected at dinner, and, during the whole
day, the steam of the soups, pies, pasties, &c., &c. which
issued from Mrs. Black's kitchen, and penetrated to the very
interior of the drawing-room, might (as some one has
parodied it) have created a stomach beneath the ribs of death.
To Gertrude, the commotion caused by what is called giving
a dinner, was something new. The total 'bouleversement of
all orders of the community, where much was to be done
without the proper means, where a sumptuous banquet was
to be prepared by the common drudges of the kitchen, and
where every servant had double their usual portion of work
to perform, besides being thrown out of their own natural
sphere of action. Then there was the running backwards and
forwards; the flying up stairs and the rushing down stairs;
the opening and shutting of doors, or rather I should say
the
opening of doors, as the shutting is an evil seldom to be com-
plained of upon any occasion, unless, indeed, when the call
of "shut the door" is answered with a slam, which shakes
the house to its foundation. Added to all this, was the losing
of Mrs. Black's keys, with the customary suspicions attached
to every individual, of having somehow or other got them
about them—suspicions only to be removed by repeated
raisings and shakings of the party suspected, and even then
not completely effaced, till the keys were found, as usual, in
some place, where somebody must surely have put them,
and where nobody would ever have thought of looking for
them.

THE INHERITANCE.
Then the nursery-maid was transformed into the cook's
assistant, and the children were committed to a girl who
could not manage them, and they broke loose, and overran
the house, and resisted all authority. But doubtless many
of my readers must have witnessed similar scenes, and
endured similar persecutions, pending the preparations for a
dinner, which, like worthy Mrs. Black's, was to be about
three times as large and as elaborate as was necessary. But
many are the paths to the temple of Fame, and hard it is to
climb by any of them. Mrs. Black was chiefly emulous of a
character for her dinners, and probably laboured infinitely
harder to stuff a dozen dull bodies, than the Author of Wa-
verley did to amuse the whole world. It was for this she
thought by night and toiled by day, but, strange to say, she
had an enjoyment in it too, though, when that was, it would
have been difficult to determine-for the anticipation was care
and fatigue—the reality was ceremony and anxiety—the re-
trospect was disappointment and provocation.
Uncle Adam was the first of the guests who arrived, and
Miss St. Clair was the only one of the family ready to receive
him. She was in the drawing-room when he entered, and
the habitual vinegar expression of his long triangular visage
relaxed into something like a smile at sight of her-he even
seated himself by her side, and entered into conversation
with a degree of complacency very unusual with him.
Emboldened by his good-humour, Gertrude ventured to
admire a very fine Camellia Japonica, which, together with a
piece of his favourite southernwood, decorated the breast of
his coat.
“I ken naething aboot the things mysel'," said he, hastily
tearing it out of the button-hole, as if ashamed of wearing any-
thing to be admired—then stuffing it into her hand—" Ha'e,
tak' it, my dear-it cam' frae that place up bye” pointing
in the direction of Bloom Park. “I'm sure they need
nae ha'e sent it to me. What ca' ye it?"
Gertrude repeated the name.
“ It's a senseless-like thing, without ony smell," applying
the southernwood to his nose as he spoke ; “but I daresay
there's plenty o' them, and I've nae use for them, so you may
gang up bye when you like, and tak’ what you like."
Gertrude thanked him, and as she adjusted the japonica in
her dress, the old garnet brooch, now her only ornament,
fell out, and in his gallantry, the old man stooped to pick it
up. But no sooner had he taken it in his hand than he
uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and, turning it over
and over, examined it with the deepest interest.
“ Wha's aught this?" inquired he.

" It is mine," replied Gertrude in some surprise.
“ Yours!” repeated he; “yours! and whar did ye get it?
tell me the truth, whar did ye get it?"
“I got it from my nurse; she gave it to me when she was
dying, and I have kept it for her sake.”
“And did she no tell you whar she had got it?”
“I think she said she had got it from her mother."
“ From her mother! it was ance my mother's,-it was
mine, and I gi'ed it to Lizzy wi' my ain hands whan last we
parted, and she promised to keep it till her dying day—there's
our initials”-pointing to the back—"and the very year we
parted.” Then, after a long pause—“What was the name
o'your nurse, and whar did she come frae ?"
“Her own name was Marianne Lamotte-her husband's
Jacob Lewiston, and she came from America; her father was
French ; but, I believe, her mother was Scotch, for she used
to sing me many an old Scotch song, which she said she had
learned from her."
“I canna mak it oot," said Mr. Ramsay thoughtfully-
“but it disna signify, though I could, it wadna bring back
life and time;" and with a sigh he tendered the brooch.
· Pray, keep it," said Gertrude; " it seems you have a
better right to it than I have. I valued it merely for the
sake of my nurse; but it is a still dearer memorial to you,
and, therefore, I willingly part with it."
“ No, no,” said he, rejecting the hand that offered it;
“what wad I do wi't?' At your age, you may please yoursel'
wi' thae kind of dead toys, but I'm ow'r auld noo to hae ony
enjoyment in sic things; the young may tak pleasure in thae
romantic gew-gaws; ye like to look back whan ye hae nae
far to cast your eye—but at threescore and ten it's a dreigh
sight to see the lang and weary road we hae wandered-No,
no, there's nae pleasure to the aged in sic mementos; they
canna bring back youthfu' days and youthfu’ hearts, and they
are the only jewels o' life.”
Gertrude could not urge it, but from a feeling of delicacy
towards her uncle's painful reminiscences, she put aside the
trinket, and resolved never again to wear it in his presence.
It is rarely that feelings raised above the ordinary pitch can
be long indulged in this strange world, where the most oppo-
site emotions are constantly coming in contact, and where the
mind is for ever in a state of ebb and flow.
Mr. Ramsay's nature had been softened, and all its best in-
gredients called forth, at sight of the love-token of his early
days, and the mournful associations which followed in its
train ; but the gentler current of his soul was speedily
checked by the entrance of the various members of the

family, as they came severally dropping in fresh from their
toilettes, and last, if not least, uncle Adam's antipathy, Miss
Bell.
Squeezing herself on the little sofa between Miss St. Clair
and him, she exclaimed, “What a beautiful flower that is,
cousin !—where did you get it?”
“Mr. Ramsay was so good as to give it to me," answered
she.
“Indeed! I suppose then it is from Bloom-Park, uncle ?
You have charming greenhouses there, I understand—that is
what I regret so much at Thornbank. You know the Major
has taken that in the meantime; but I don't think it will
answer, as there are no hot-houses, and the Major has been
accustomed to such charming fruits in India, that I'm afraid
he will miss his pines sadly."
“I suppose there will be plenty o' gude neeps," said Mr.
Ramsay; “neeps like succur—he can take ane o' them when
he's dry."
Miss Bell reddened, but, affecting not to hear, returned to
the charge.
" Thornbank is no great distance from Bloom-Park, uncle,
quite an easy walk, I should think.”
“I never measured it," was the laconic reply.
Finding it was not by way of Bloom-Park she was likely
to arrive at uncle Adam's pocket, Miss Bell now went more
directly to the point.
“Do you know, uncle, I could be almost jealous of my
cousin for having got that beautiful japonica from you, while
poor I have not so much as a single leaf from you by way of
keepsake."
Mr. Ramsay, with a bow and a sardonic smile, here pre-
sented her with the piece of southernwood he held in his hand.
“Well, uncle, I assure you, I shall value this very much,
and lay it up with the rest of my wedding presents—and, by-
the-bye, I have never showed you all the fine things my kind
friends have presented to me.
Good old Mrs. Waddell of
Waddell Mains has presented me with a most beautiful antique
silver cup, which, it seems, was the Major's christening bowl.”
“It will be ancient enough then, nae doot,” observed uncle
Adam.
“My excellent aunts have sent me a very handsome tea-
" A fool and his money's soon parted; they had very little
to do to send ony such thing."

“Miss Bell Black, I've seen something mair o' the world
than you've done; and I can tell ye some o' its customs that
ye maybe dinna ken yet-in Russia, for instance, the present
to persons in your situation is-
ão! for Heaven's sake!”-interrupted Miss Bell, with an
instinctive dread of the knout—"don't set up these bears as
models for us—the customs of our own country surely ought
to guide us on these occasions."
“It's a very senseless custom, in my opinion," said Mr.
Ramsay. “It's like casting pearls before swine to be lavish-
ing presents on a woman that's at the very pinnacle o’human
happiness and grandeur—it's you that should mak presents
to puir single folk that hae nae Major Waddells to set them
up wi' Ingee shawls, and carbuncles, and fans-and-
can compare ye to naething but a goddess the noo-let me
see, which othem is't? A Juno? na, I'm thinkin' it'll
rather be a Vainass."
Here uncle Adam was so tickled with his own 'jeu de mot,'
that he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. The in-
sult was too broad even for Miss Bell, who walked away in
silent indignation; then, recovering himself, he pointed after
her to Gertrude, and said,-
“That creature's folly's just like dust-drive it out o' ae
thing, and it just flees to anither.”

CHAPTER XXVI.
It was with pleasure Gertrude hailed the stately turrets of
Rossville, as on her return she beheld them rising above the
rich masses of wood which surrounded them and again her
heart bounded with delight as she thought—"All this will
one day be mine—mine to bestow-"
She did not finish the sentence even to herself, but the
image of Colonel Delmour rose to her view, and she felt, that
even the brilliant destiny that awaited her would be poor and
joyless, unless he were to partake of it. On alighting, Mrs.
St. Clair hastened to Lord Rossville to report to him the suc-
cess of her canvass, and Gertrude soon found herself, she
knew not how, strolling by the banks of the river with Colo-
nel Delmour by her side.
It is universally allowed, that, though nothing can be more
interesting in itself than the conversation of two lovers, yet
nothing can be more insipid in detail-just as the heavenly
fragrance of the rose becomes vapid and sickly under all the
attempts made to retain and embody its exquisite odour.

THE INHERITANCE,
Colonel Delmour certainly was in love--as much so as it was
in his nature to be—but, as has been truly said, how many
noxious ingredients enter into the composition of what is
sometimes called love! Pride-vanity-ambition-self-in-
terest, all these had their share in the admiration, which
Colonel Delmour accorded to the beauties and the graces of
Miss St. Clair. In any situation in life, his taste would have
led him to admire her, but it was only as the heiress of
Rossville his pride would have permitted him to have loved
her. But he was aware of the obstacles that stood in the
way of his wishes, and deemed it most prudent not to oppose
himself openly to them at present. He was conscious of the
odium he would incur, were he to enter the lists as the rival
of his brother, knowing, as he had all along done, that that
brother was the destined husband of the heiress of Rossville.
His aim, therefore, was to secure her affections in a clandestine
manner-leaving it to his brother to make his proposals
openly, and when they had been rejected, he would then come
forward and prefer his suit. This maneuvre would, to be
sure, expose Gertrude to the whole weight of her uncle's dis-
pleasure, and, probably, bring much persecution upon her,
but with a character such as hers, that would only tend to
strengthen her attachment, and Colonel Delmour was too
selfish to prize the happiness, even of the woman he loved,
beyond his own, or rather, like many others of the same
nature, he wished that her happiness should be of a reflected
nature, emanating solely from himself. Having bewailed the
necessity he was under of leaving Rossville the following day,
ne then gave way to the most vehement expressions of
despair, at the thoughts of leaving one a thousand times
dearer to him than life, and that too without the only solace
that could soften the anguish of separation, the belief that
his feelings were understood—the hope that they might one
day be mutual.
Gertrude remained silent ; but there was a deep struggle
in her breast; her mother's prejudice-her uncle's plans-
made her feel the dangers and difficulties of their attachment,
while they, at the same time, served to heighten it. Colonel
Delmour saw what was passing in her mind, and that he must
now bring the matter to a decision.
With all the impassioned sophistry of which he was master,
he contrived to draw from Gertrude an indirect acknowledg-
ment that he was not perfectly indifferent to her, and he then
urged the necessity there was for carefully concealing their
attachment for the present.
“Can this be right ?" thought Gertrude—and her conscience
told her-No; but, averse as she was to every species of dis-

125
simulation and deceit, she was equally a stranger to the
meanness of suspicion, and to suspect the man she loved was
not in her nature-love and suspicion were the very antipodes
of her mind. She therefore quickly banished the slight sug-
gestion that had arisen, though she could not so easily recon-
cile to erself the idea that she was acting a clandestine part
in thus deceiving, by not disclosing to her mother what had
passed. But Colonel Delmour besought her with so much
earnestness to withhold the communication for the present,
and she dreaded so much to encounter her mother's violence
and prejudice, that perhaps, on the whole, she was not sorry
for an excuse to indulge undisturbed yet a while in “Love's
young dream.". Had Mrs. St. Clair ever been the friend of
her daughter, Gertrude would not have acted thus ; for her
nature was open and ingenuous, and she would have disdained
every species of concealment and duplicity. But the whirl-
wind and the tempest are not more baleful in their effects on
the material world, than tyranny and violence are destructive
of all the finer qualities of the mind with which they come in
contact. They must either irritate or deaden all those free-
born affections of the soul, which, like the first vernal shoots,
possess a charm in their freshness alone, which art and culture
would in vain seek to impart.
When the lovers reached the Castle it was within a few
minutes of the dinner hour, and Gertrude flew to her room
where she found her mother waiting for her.
“ Where have you been, child ?” cried she, in no very
complacent tone. « Lord Rossville has been asking for you at
least a dozen times, and no one could give any account of you."
“I have been walking by the river, mamma,” replied her
daughter in some confusion.
“I wish you would leave off these idle rambles of yours.
I am quite of the Earl's opinion that the less young ladies in-
dulge in solitary rambles the better."
Mamma, I was not—" alone, Gertrude would have added,
though in some trepidation, but Mrs. St. Clair interrupted her.
" Come~come, there is no time to waste in excuses-you
will be late as it is, so make haste-you ought to have re-
membered there is to be company here to-day to whom Lord
Rossville wished to present you in due pomp-perhaps to
serve some little political purpose; but no matter-he is a
generous noble-minded man in spite of his little peculiarities.
He was anxious to have seen you to-day for two purposes
which I am commissioned to fulfil : the first is, that you are
to bestow your attention exclusively upon Mr. Delmour; the
next is, to decorate you with a splendid gift for the occasion.
Luckily you are in looks to do credit to my work. See, here

is what your kind generous uncle presents you with," and
opening a jewel-case she displayed a set of costly pearls. A
pang shot through Gertrude's heart as she thought, “ Would
he have bestowed these upon me if he had known that I am
acting in opposition to his wishes ? Oh! why am I compelled
thus to play the hypocrite ?” And she sighed and shrank
back as her mother would have decked her in oriental magni-
ficence. Mrs. St. Clair looked at her with astonishment.
" What is the matter, Gertrude? This is a strange time to
sigh when adorning with gems which even the future Coun-
tess of Rossville might be proud to wear.”
Gertrude passively extended her arm to have the costly
bracelets clasped on it; but Mrs. St. Clair knew not that to
those who had just been plighting hearts even Golconda's
mines would have seemed poor and dim-at that moment
Gertrude felt that wealth and honours were but as “painted
clay."
CHAPTER XXVII.
MEANWHILE the carriages were beginning to draw up in rapid
succession, and Lord Rossville, though fretting inwardly at
his niece's delay, yet received the company with much out-
ward serenity. He felt that he was master of his own person
and manners, and all the dignity and urbanity for which he
flattered himself he was so celebrated, had now full scope in
the absence of Miss Pratt. His step was firmer-his chest
was broader-his nose was higher-his language was finer-
his sentences were longer-his periods were rounder-in
short, Richard was himself again.
Already had he uttered many sensible, and even some
witty sayings, to such of his guests as had arrived, while his
mind was busy concocting a pun to be applied to Sir Peter
Wellwood when he should appear. But, alas ! for the inse-
curity of the best-laid schemes of human wisdom! Sir Peter
and Lady Wellwood were announced ; and-horror of hor-
rors ! who should enter with them but Miss Pratt! Who can
paint the Earl as he stood pierced with severe amazement?
Not Celadon when he beheld his Amelia struck a blackened
corse, gazed with more marble aspect than did his Lordship
at sight of the breathing form of Miss Pratt. The half-
formed pun died on his lips—a faint and indistinct notion of
it floated through his bewildered brain-it was to have been
something about a Well and a Wood, or a Wood and a Well;
but the Earl's wits were in a wood, and he could certainly
have wished Miss Pratt in a well. In vain did he even ate

tempt to say something of Wellcome; the words clove to the
roof of his mouth, and his looks did not make up for the
deficiencies of his tongue. But Miss Pratt had not been
looked at for fifty years to be disconcerted, at that time of life,
by the looks of any man living, and she, therefore, accosted
him in her usual manner.
“Well, my Lord, you see I've been better than my word;
I daresay you didn't think of seeing me to-day; and, to tell
you the truth, I didn't think of it myself; but Sir Peter and
Lady Wellwood happened to call, en passant, at Lady
M'Caw's, and as they were so good as offer me a seat in their
carriage, I thought I couldn't do better than just come and
make out the rest of my visit to you, Lady Betty, Lady
Mildmay, Lady Restall," &c. &c. &c., and in a moment Miss
Pratt was buzzing all round the room.
At sound of the gong, Mrs. St. Clair had hastily put the
last finish to her daughter's dress, and hurried her to the
drawing-room. As they entered all eyes were turned to-
wards them. Lord Rossville was struck with the surpassing
beauty of his niece, and attributing it entirely to the effect of
his pearls, he advanced from the circle in which he was
standing, and taking her hand with an air of gratified pride,
led her towards the company. He was in the act of present-
ing her to a Dowager Marchioness, for whom he entertained
a high veneration, when, at that moment, Mr. Lyndsay en-
tered from the opposite side of the room. Their eyes met
for the first time since that eventful midnight scene in the
wood—a slight suffusion crossed his face, but in an instant
the colour mounted to her very temples, and in answer to
the Marchioness's introductory remarks, she stammered out
she knew not what. The consciousness of her confusion only
served to increase it-she was aware that the eyes of the
company were upon her, but she felt only the influence of
Colonel Delmour's.
Lord Rossville, attributing his niece's embarrassment solely
to awe and respect for himself and his guests, was beginning
to reassure and encourage her in a manner which would have
increased her confusion tenfold, when fortunately dinner was
announced. Amid the usual bustle of fixing the order of
procession, with all the accompanying ceremonies necessary
to be observed in walking from one room to another, Ger-
trude was recovering her presence of mind, when, as Miss
Pratt passed, leaning on the arm of her ally, Sir Peter, she
whispered, " Aye! these are pearls of great price, indeed!
So, so-somebody has come good speed. Love, like light,
will not hide at, ha!" and with an intolerable tap of her fan,
and a significant chuckle, on she pattered, while again Ger-

with anger.
trude's cheeks were dyed with blushes. At that moment,
Colonel Delmour, who had heard Miss Pratt's remarks, acci-
dentally trod upon her gown in such a manner as almost to
tear away the skirt from the body.
" Was there ever the like of this ?” cried she, reddening
“My good plowman's gauze! Colonel Delmour,
do you see what you've done ?" But Colonel Delmour,
without deigning to take the least notice of the injury he had
inflicted, passed on to offer his arm to one of the Miss Mild-
mays.
Miss Pratt's only solace, therefore, was the sympathy of
Sir Peter, to whom she detailed all the mischief Colonel Del-
mour had done her, first and last, concluding with a remark,
which, though in an affected whisper, was intended to reach
his ear—that, indeed, it was no wonder he came such bad
speed at the courting-she had need to be both a bold woman
and a rich one who would choose such a rough wooer. This
disaster, however, had the effect of a quietus upon Miss Pratt
for some time, and Lord Rossville got leave to expand to his
utmost dimensions, unchecked by any interruptions from her.
None of the company now assembled seemed to have any
particular part to play in the great drama of life; they were
all common-place, well-bred, eating and drinking elderly
lords and ladies, or well-dressed, talking, smiling, flirting
masters and misses. Gertrude was as usual appropriated by
Mr. Delmour, who paid her much attention, and some very
pretty compliments in a gentlemanly but somewhat business-
like manner. Colonel Delmour sat, on the other hand, silent,
thoughtful, and displeased, neglecting even the common
attentions which politeness required.
Mr. Lyndsay was on the opposite side of the table, and
upon his asking Miss St. Clair to drink wine with him, Colonel
Delmour turned his eye quickly upon her, and again a deep
blush mantled her cheeks, something, perhaps, of wounded
pride at the suspicion implied in his glance, or it may be of
that shame natural to the ingenuous mind at the sense of
mystery and concealment. Whatever its cause its effect was
sufficiently visible on Colonel Delmour; he turned pale with
suppressed anger-bit his lip—nor addressed a single word to
her during the whole of dinner.
There is only this difference betwixt a summer and a winter
party, that in winter the company form into one large cluster
round the fire, and in summer they fall into little detached
groups, and are scattered all over the apartment. Upon
entering the drawing-room, Gertrude had unconsciously seated
herself apart from everybody at an open window where she
thought she was contemplating the beams of the setting sun

as they glowed upon the hills, and glittered through the rich
green foliage of some intervening elms. But, in fact, she
was ruminating on the various occurrences of the day, and
the awkward predicament in which she found herself placed
with Mr. Lyndsay.
She was roused from her reverie by some one putting their
hands before her eyes, and presently the dreaded accents of
Pratt smote her ear, as she struck up, “ As pensive I thought
of my love, eh?”. Then, drawing in a chair, she seated
herself close by Miss St. Clair, and taking her hand with an
air of friendly sympathy and perfect security, she began-
“ I'm sure it must be a relief to you to have got away from
the dinner-table to-day. I really felt for you, for I know by
experience what my gentleman is when he is in his tantrams;
did you see how he was like to tear me in pieces to-day for
nothing but because I happened to see how the land lay
between a certain person and you? Just look at my good
plowman's gauze," turning round. “I assure you, my dear,
I was very much afraid, at one time, that you would have
been taken in by him ; for I saw that he made a dead set at
you from the first, and be can be very agreeable when he
chooses ; but, take my word for it, he's a very impertinent,
ill-bred, ill-tempered man for all that.”
Colouring with confusion and indignation, Gertrude had
sat silently enduring the obloquy lavished on her lover, from
utter inability to interrupt her ; but at this climax she made a
movement to extricate herself, which, however, was in vain.
Miss Pratt again seized the hand which had been with-
drawn, and with a significant squeeze, resumed—“ You
needn't be afraid of me, my dear, your secret's safe with me;
and to tell you the truth, I've suspected the thing for some
time. I only wish you had looked about you a little ; there's
Anthony Whyte has never so much as seen you yet; if he
would but make up his mind to marry, what a husband he
would make! very different from our friend the Colonel, to
be sure; many's the sore heart his wife will have, and many
a sore heart he has given already with his flirtations, for he's
never happy but when he's making love to somebody or
other, married or single, it's all the same to him."
“Miss Pratt,” cried Gertrude, in great emotion, as she
again tried to disengage herself from her, “I cannot listen
to-
“Well, my dear, it's very good of you to stand up for him,"
with a pat on the shoulder; " for it's seldom ladies take such
a lift of their cast lovers; but it's as well you should know
all you've escaped "—then lowering her voice to a mysterious
whisper, “Just to give you one single trait of him, which I

know to be a fact—what do you think of his owing Edward
Lyndsay seven thousand pound for his game debts ?- That I
can pledge myself for-I was staying in the house with them
both at the time. I was upon a visit to Lady Augusta in
London, and I had good access to see what went on; and I
saw rather more too than what they thought of. Edward
Lyndsay was just of age then; and he was invited there to
be presented and introduced by the Delmours, for, you know,
they're at the very top of the tree in London-I suspect
there was a scheme for getting Edward to one of the misses
- but it wouldn't do. Well, the Colonel was to take charge
of him, and bring him into fashion by way of—for he's a
great deal older, you know, and was very soon old in the
ways of the world-he's no such chicken, for, as young as
he looks, he must now be a man between thirty and forty."
-Miss Pratt knew to an hour his age, and that he was
just thirty. — “Well, the Colonel introduced him into the
fashionable circles, and a fine set (or else not) he initiated
him into :-he even took him to the gaming-table, where
he lost some money; but what do ye think of his having
to pay seven thousand pound and upwards for the Colonel?
- seven thousand pound gambled away in one night, and
not a shilling to pay it! The consequence was, he must
have sold out, and been ruined for ever, if Edward Lyndsay
had not advanced the money; and, to this day, I'll be bound
for it, he has never touched one halfpenny of principal or
interest. Where was it to come from? He lives far beyond
his income—anybody may see that, with his curricle and his
fine horses, and his groom and his valet; while there's the
person that he owes all that money to keeps no carriage, and
rides all over the country without so much as a servant after
him; and my gentleman can't go to a neighbour's house
without having a retinue like a prince after him. But the
provoking thing is, there's Lord Rossville and many other
people crying out upon Edward for his extravagance and
folly in having muddled away his money, and not living as he
should do, and making no figure in the world—when I know
that he's just pinching and saving to make up
the money and
clear his estate from the debt he contracted upon it for his
pretty cousin there! I once gave Lord Rossville a hint of
how matters stood, but he's so infatuated with these Delmours,
I thought he would have worried me there's nothing they
can do that's wrong :-not that he's very fond of the Colonel,
or likes his company—but he's proud of him, because he's
the fashion, and has made a figure—and so he goes on telling
everybody what great characters the Delmours are. I assure
you, it's all I can do to keep my tongue within my teeth

sometimes ;-but Colonel Delmour's a man I wouldn't like to
provoke. What do you think of his having the impertinence
to tell me, that, if he found me meddling in his affairs, he
would pull Anthony Whyte's nose for him! I should like to
see him offer to lay a finger on Anthony Whyte! But that's
just a specimen of him—01 he's an insolent, extravagant,
selfish puppy But, are you well enough, my dear ?"
Gertrude had made many ineffectual attempts to stop the
torrent of Miss Pratt's invective; but that lady was no more
to be stopped in her career than a ship in full speed, or a
racer on the course. At length uttering an exclamation, she
abruptly extricated herself from her grasp, and quitted the
There was commonly a mixture of truth and falsehood in
all Miss Pratt's narrations; but it must be owned the present
formed an exception—perhaps a solitary one, to her ordinary
practice. She had for once told a round unvarnished tale,
with merely a little exaggeration as to the sum, and for once
she had spoken from actual knowledge, not from mere con-
jecture. Miss Pratt had, by some means or other, best known
to herself, contrived to lay her hands upon a letter of Colonel
Delmour's, which had led her into the secret of the money
transaction-a transaction which, from honour and delicacy
on the one side, pride and shame on the other, would other-
wise have been for ever confined to the parties themselves.
In vain did Gertrude strive to still the tumult of her mind
in the silence of her own chamber—in vain did she repeat a
thousand times to herself, “Why should I for an instant
give ear to the paltry gossip of a person I despise ?-How is
it that I can be guilty of injuring the man I love by yielding
the shadow of belief to the calumnies of a Miss Pratt ?—No,
no, I do not, I will not believe them-Shame to me for even
listening to them! False--fickle-mercenary—a gamester-
impossible !"
Alas! Gertrude believed it was impossible, because she
loved-because all the affections of a warm, generous, con-
fiding heart, were lavished on this idol of her imagination,
which she had decked in all the attributes of perfection. And
yet, such is the delusion of passion, that, could she even have
beheld him bereſt of all those virtues and graces with which
her young romantic heart had so liberally invested him, even
then she would not have ceased to love. Ah! what will not
the heart endure, ere it will voluntarily surrender the hoarded
treasure of its love to the cold dictates of reason, or the stern
voice of duty !

THE INHERITANCE.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
It was so long ere Gertrude could compose herself sufficiently
to return to the drawing-room, that, when she did, she found
the gentlemen had already joined the party. In some con-
fusion she took the first seat that offered, which happened to
be part of a sofa on which one of the Miss Millbanks was
lounging, and on the back of which Mr. Lyndsay was leaning.
But it was not tilt she had seated herself that she was aware
of his vicinity: To add to her embarrassment, Miss Pratt
crossed from the opposite side of the room, and took her seat
alongside of her.
“I was just going to look for you, my dear,” said she, in
one of her loud, all-pervading whispers ; "I was afraid you
wasn't very well; but upon saying that to Mrs. St. Clair, she
said, she daresay'd you were just taking an evening ramble-
for that you're a great moonlight stroller, like some other
people,” with a significant smile at Mr. Lyndsay, and again
Gertrude felt the colour mount to her cheeks. She raised
her eyes, but met his fixed on her with such an expression of
deep and thoughtful inquiry, as redoubled her confusion; and,
scarcely knowing what she said, she uttered an exclamation
at the heat of the room.
“ Are you too hot, my dear?” cried her tormentor, taking
a fan out of her pocket, and rising as she spoke ; "then
here's work for you, Mr. Edward ; sit you down there and
fan Miss St. Clair-not that I want to make a coolness between
ye,” added she, in a half whisper, loud enough to reach
Colonel Delmour, who stood by the fire sipping his coffee ;
“but I really don't think the room's hot; it must just be
coming in from the cold air that makes you feel the room
-You would do well, Mr. Edward, to give this fair
lady a lecture on her moonlight rambles. 1-
" It is insupportable !" cried Gertrude, starting up, unable
longer to endure Miss Pratt's mal-apropos observations.
* It is very hot,” said Lyndsay, scarcely less embarrassed
than herself. “Shall we seek a little fresh air at the win-
dow?". And offering his arm, he led her towards one, and
threw it open. Gertrude's agitation rather increased than
diminished.
“Oh! what must you think of me !" at length she ex-
claimed, in a low voice of repressed anguish.
"Were I to tell you," replied Mr. Lyndsay, in some emo-
tion, “I fear you would think me very presumptuous.'

“Impossible !” said Gertrude, with increasing agitation as
she advanced on this perilous subject ; “I feel that I must
ever—" She stopped; her mother's caution, her own pro-
mises recurred to her, and she felt that her impetuosity was
hurrying her beyond the bounds prescribed. Both remained
silent, but Lyndsay still held her hand, and looked upon
her
with an expression of no common interest. He was, how-
ever, recalled to other considerations by the approach of Mr.
Delmour, when, relinquishing her hand, he made some re-
mark on the heat of the room having been too much for Miss
St. Clair.
“ It is only in the sphere of my fair cousin herself,” said
Mr. Delmour, with a bow and a smile ;
" the fire of her eyes
seldom fails to kindle a flame wherever their influence is
felt."
Gertrude scarcely heard this flat, hackneyed compliment;
but she felt the taunt implied, when Colonel Delmour, who
was always hovering near her, said with asperity,-
“Such fires, however, are sometimes mere "ignes fatui,'
which shine only to deceive.'
“A cruel aspersion upon glow-worms, and ladies' eyes,”
said Mr. Lyndsay, "since both may, and certainly do, shine
without any such wicked intention."
"Were it not that the thing must be," said Mr. Delmour,
with a bow to Miss St. Clair, “I should imagine it would be
difficult to overheat this room ; it is large, not less, I take it,
than forty by thirty, lofty, prodigious walls, and a north-west
exposure ; if it were well lighted, indeed, that might have
some effect, but at present it is rather deficient; there ought
to be, at least, a dozen lamps instead of those pale ineffectual
wax candles ; but, in fact, it is not every one who knows how
to light a room ;-in a well-lit room, there. ought not to be a
vestige of shade, while here, in many places, for instance,
where we are standing, it is absolute darkness visible.”
Yes, it is a sort of a Pandemonium light,” said Colonel
Delmour, scornfully.
"The mind is its own place, you know, Delmour," said Mr.
Lyndsay ; 66 and in itself -” he stopped and smiled.
“ Go on,” cried Colonel Delmour, in a voice of suppressed
anger; pray, don't be afraid to finish your quotation.”
Mr. Lyndsay repeated,—“can make a heaven of hell, a
hell of heaven."
Colonel Delmour seemed on the point of giving way to his
passion; but he checked himself, and affected to laugh, while
he said, “A flattering compliment implied, no doubt, but if
I am the Lucifer you insinuate, I can boast of possessing his
best attributes also, for I too bear a mind not to be changed
by place or time, and, in my creed, constancy still ranks as a

virtue.” He looked at Gertrude as he pronounced these
words in an emphatic manner.
“What are you all doing in this dark corner ?" asked Lady
Betty, as she advanced with Flora under her arm.
“We came here to be cool,” answered Mr. Lyndsay, “and
we are all getting very warm.'
“ That is most extraordinary," said her ladyship; “but did
any of
you lift the third volume of “The Midnight Wed-
"We'll thank you to pull down that window," cried Miss
Pratt. “I wonder what you're all made of, for we are per-
fectly starving here; sit a little more this way, Sir Peter,
your moonlight days and mine are both over. Indeed, as
Anthony Whyte says, I never see anything but a swelled
face and a flannel lappet in the moon. Then going to Mr.
Lyndsay, she touched his elbow, and beckoned him a little
apart.
“So,I wish you joy—the cat's out of the bag; but take
care what you're about, for a certain person,” pointing to
Colonel Delmour, " will be ready to bite your nose off. 'Pon
my word, you quiet people always play your cards best after
ali ;"—and with a friendly pat on the back, Miss Pratt whisked
away, and the next minute was bustling about a whist party
with Lord Rossville and Sir Peter.
The arrangement of their table was always a work of deli-
cacy and difficulty; the Earl was fond of whist
, and so was
Miss Pratt; and for upwards of thirty years they had been
in the occasional habit of playing together in the most dis-
cordant manner imaginable. Miss Pratt played like lightning
---the Earl_pondered every card, as though life depended on
the cast. Every card—every spot of a card, out or in, was
registered in Pratt's memory, ready at a call. The Earl was
a little confused, and sometimes committed blunders, which
were invariably pointed out, and animadverted upon by Miss
Pratt, whether as his antagonist or his partner. Then she
had the impertinence to shake her head, and hem, sigh, and
even groan at times; and to sum up the whole, when they
played together, she had the assurance to insist upon taking
the tricks, which was an usurpation of power beyond all en-
durance.
While the seniors of the company were arranging them.
selves at their several card parties, the younger part repaired
to the music-room, where Gertrude was urged to sing by all
present, except Colonel Delmour, who preserved a moody
silence. Teazed into compliance, she at length seated herself
at the harp, and began to prelude.
“You accompany Miss St. Clair, Frederick ?” said Mr.
Delmour to his brother, in a tone of inquiry.

66 Miss St. Clair has found out that I am a bad accompani-
ment," answered he in a manner which only Gertrude could
understand. " To one who sings so true, so perfectly free
from all falsetto, it must be a severe penance to find herself
clogged with me, who am a perfect novice in that art, as in
every other."
“I prefer singing alone,” said Gertrude, vainly trying to
conceal her agitation at this insulting speech.
“ It is extremely mortifying,” said Mr. Lyndsay, instantly
attracting the attention to himself, “ that I am seldom or
never asked to sing; it is difficult to account for this insensi-
bility on the part of my friends in particular—of the world in
general; but I am resolved to remain no longer silent under
such contumely. Miss St. Clair will take me under her
patronage ; my wrongs shall be heard in full bravura this
very night-where shall I find words vast enough to express
my feelings
And he turned over the music, while he
hummed Guarini's “Bring me a hundred reeds of decent
growth to form a pipe,” &c., then selecting a beautiful arietta,
he placed it before Miss St. Clair, saying, 6. Will the mistress
allow her protégé to choose for herself and him ?"
Gertrude, though in some degree restored to self-possession,
could only bow her acquiescence; but the state of her feel-
ings was such, as prevented her doing justice either to herself
or her accompaniment. She was scarcely sensible of the
beauty of his style of singing. Neither was it then she was
struck with the singularity of having lived so long under the
same roof, without being aware that he possessed a skill and
taste in music which, with most people, would have formed a
prominent feature in their character, and which they would
ſong ere then have found an opportunity of displaying. But
Lyndsay did nothing for display, and now his talents were
merely brought out when they could be of service to another.
Gertrude, however, saw nothing of all this-she saw nothing
but that Colonel Delmour had disappeared, upon Mr. Lynd-
say taking his station by her. The song ended, she hastily
relinquished her seat to another lady, and it was occupied in
rotation till carriages were announced, and the party broke
up. Gertrude availed herself of the bustle of departures to
make her escape to her own chamber ; but as she passed
through the suite of apartments, she found Colonel Delmour
in one of the most remote, pacing up and down with every
mark of disquiet. She would have retreated, but quickly
advancing, he seized her hand ; then, in the same cold
ironical manner he had hitherto practised, he requested that
Miss St. Clair would honour him so far as to endure his pre-
sence for a few moments.

“I know nothing Colonel Delmour can have to say to me,”
answered Gertrude, roused to something like indignation ;
“ unless, indeed, to apologise for his behaviour.”
“ Apologise !" repeated he with vehemence. “No, that
certainly is not my purpose-unless Miss St. Clair will first
deign to account for hers; but the thing is impossible; how-
ever I might distrust others, I cannot disbelieve the evidence
of my own senses-
“I am ignorant of your meaning ;-I cannot listen to such
frantic expressions -" and she sought to withdraw her hand
from him.
“Frantic! Yes, I am frantic to seek that explanation from
you which I have a right to demand and will demand from
another quarter."
“For mercy's sake! tell me what is the meaning of this?”
cried Gertrude, in great emotion. “Why am I subjected to
hear such violent-such insulting language--and from you!"
And the tears burst from her eyes.
Colonel Delmour gazed upon her for a few minutes in
silence, then in a somewhat calmer tone, and heaving a deep
sigh, he proceeded-
“But a few hours ago, and tears from your eyes would
have been as blood from my own heart—and even yet, de-
ceived and injured as I am -” he stopped in much agita-
tion; then again giving way to his passion—"But you ask
me why you are subjected to such language ?-your own
heart might have spared you that question."
“I have not deserved this—I will not endure it;" and Miss
St. Clair again sought to leave the room.
“Then why have I deserved—why must I endure to be
mocked and deluded with hopes you never meant to realise ?
--Yes—that cold-blooded systematic puritan Lyndsay dares
to love you—and you—but he shall answer for this to
For a moment Gertrude regarded him with a look of the
most unfeigned astonishment, which only gave way to the
deep blush that dyed her cheeks—but it was not the blush of
shame or confusion, but the glow of indignation, and, with an
air of offended dignity, she said
"Since you believe me capable, after what passed to-day,
of loving another, you might well treat me as you have
done ; but what am I to think of one who could, for a single
instant, suspect me of such base—such monstrous duplicity?”
“ Gertrude,” cried Colonel Delmour, in great agitation,
Gertrude, I am a wretch if you -but why those blushes
—that confusion at sight of him ?-_Why that air of intelli-
gence that attends your intercourse, and -Did I not hear
me."

you myself, when you withdrew with him to the window, ask,
with all the solicitude of the most heart-felt interest, what he
must think of you ? -he -What would his thoughts sig-
nify to you if your affections were mine ?”
Gertrude felt almost despair as she thought of the impossi-
bility of clearing herself from suspicions, which she was aware
there was but too much reason to attach to her-and she re-
mained silent, while Colonel Delmour's eyes were fixed upon
her with an expression of the most intense anxiety. At
length, with a deep sigh, she said,
"That there exists a mutual cause of embarrassment be-
twixt Mr. Lyndsay and me, I do not deny; but it is one
which involves the interest of a third person, and I dare not
divulge it even to you—that, and that only, is the cause of
the confusion you witnessed, and of the words you overheard
- More I cannot—dare not say-I am pledged to silence."
By him ?" demanded Colonel Delmour impetuously.
"Nomby another-but that other I may not name.”
Colonel Delmour still looked doubtingly.
" And how long is this mysterious connection to con-
tinue ?"
“ Heaven only knows !—but do not do not ask me far-
ther."
And as she bent her head dejectedly forward, the string of
pearls which hung from her neck attracted her lover's eye,
and again his wavering suspicions were roused, as he remem-
bered
the conversation repeated by Miss Pratt.
“ And these precious baubles !” cried he, pointing con-
temptuously to them—“Do they form part of the mysterious
chain which links your fate so indissolubly with that of Mr.
Lyndsay?"
“I see I am doubted—disbelieved—it is degrading to be
thus interrogated !" and with an air of displeasure, foreign to
her natural character, she rose to quit the room.
“ Gertrude," cried Colonel Delmour, detaining her, "you
know not—you cannot conceive how my heart is racked and
tortured. I will-I must have my doubts ended one way or
other ere we part-perhaps for ever :-tell me then-are not
these the gift of that -of Edward Lyndsay ?”
“The gift of Edward Lyndsay !" repeated Gertrude, in the
utmost amazement. " What an idea!' and she almost smiled
in scorn.
“The pearls are a present I received not many
hours since from Lord Rossville-I thought little of them
then," added she, with a simple tenderness, which carried
conviction even to Colonel Delmour, " for I had just parted
from you."
“Gertrude, dearest Gertrude, can you forgive me?" and

he poured forth the most vehement reproaches on himself,
mingled with such expressions of love towards her as failed
not to obtain pardon. He related to her what had passed
with Miss Pratt relative to the pearls, and in so doing served
a double purpose, by clearing himself from the charges that
had been brought against him by that lady. This trait of
her served to show Gertrude how little dependence ought to
be placed on her report, and she felt as though she too had
been guilty of injustice towards her lover, in even listening
to her malicious insinuations.
Though somewhat pained, yet, on the whole, she was not
displeased at what had passed. Like many others, she che-
rished that fatal mistake-that jealousy is the offspring of
love, rather than the infirmity of temper, and, as such, its
excesses were easily forgiven. In short, this was a lovers'
quarrel-a first quarrel too, and, consequently, it served
rather to heighten than diminish the mutual attachment.
Delmour was to set off early the following morning; and
Gertrude, too much agitated to return to the company, took
farewell of him, and hastened to her own apartment, to hide
her parting tears.
CHAPTER XXIX.
MR. LYNDSAY was neither a weak nor a vain man, and he
was too well acquainted with the nature of Miss Pratt to
attach much credit to anything she said. He was aware that,
without absolutely speaking falsehood, she very rarely spoke
truth-that, like many other people, she failed in repeating
precisely what she heard, not so much from design as from
confusion of brain, redundancy of fancy, imperfect organic
construction, or, in short, some one or all of the causes,
which seem to render simple repetition infinitely more difficult
than the most compound multiplication or addition. Much
might be said upon this subject, but few readers are fond of
digressions, especially when of a moral or didactic nature ;
the cause of Miss Pratt's observations must, therefore, be
left to the construction of the world, which is seldom dis-
posed to be over charitable in its conclusions.
Mr. Lyndsay, indeed, was little in the habit of attending
to her words, being possessed of that enviable power of men-
tal transmigration which placed him, when even within her
grasp, quite beyond the influence of her power. He had,
however, been struck with the mystical fragments of speech
she had bestowed on him the preceding evening —he was
aware how little dependence was to be placed upon them,

as
but, like the spider, her webs, even though wove out of her
own intellectual resources, must still have something to cling
to, and he resolved to lose no time in demolishing those cob-
webs of her imagination. He therefore accosted her the fol-
lowing morning as, according to custom, she stood airing her-
self at the hall-door, and, without allowing her time to
spread her wings and fly off in any of her discursive flights,
he gravely begged to know the meaning of the words she
had addressed to him the evening before.
My words !" exclaimed she, in some astonishment at being
for the first time in her life asked for words. My words?
what are you going to make of my words, my dear ?"
“Not much; but I confess I am rather curious to know in
what way I am thought to have played my cards so well
6601 I know where you are now—but if you want to take
me in, Mr. Edward, that won't do ; they say, “Day-light
peeps through a small hole,' and 'Love, like smoke, will not
hide ;' so you needn't trouble yourself to go about the bush
with me—but you needn't be afraid-mum's the word_mum
and budget, ha, ha, hal do you remember that? It's mum
with you, it seems, and budget with a certain gay Colonel,
for he's off the field_ayel you've really been very sly, but
what will my Lord and his member say to it, think you ?"
“ It would be affectation in me to pretend that I do not
understand your allusions, groundless and absurd as they
are,” said Lyndsay ; “ but I do assure you, upon my word of
honour-
“ Bow wow, my dear, don't tell me of your words of
honour in love affairs ; I'll rather trust to my own eyes and
ears than to any of your words of honour. I declare you're
as bad as Anthony Whyte. I thought he would have raised
the country at the report of his marriage with Lady Sophia
Bellendean. He certainly did pay her some attentions, but
he never went the lengths that people said, though it wasn't
for want of good encouragement.”
“Well, but as I have never presumed to pay attentions,
and cannot boast of having received any encouragement, any
report of that kind must have originated in some mistake,
and would place both parties in an awkward predicament."
“Fiddle faddle! Really, my dear, when the lady doesn't
deny it I don't think it sets you very well to be so discom-
posed about it-aye, you may look, but I assure you it's
the case that she as much as confessed it to me last night-
“ Confessed what?" asked Mr. Lyndsay in amazement.
66 Just that the Colonel had got his offset. Oh! how I

enjoy that, and that a certain person,” with a bow,
her humble servant."
“Impossible! your ears have deceived you."
“My ears deceive me, indeed! what would they do that
for ? you surely don't think I'm deaf, and if I am I'm sure I'm
not blind? You lovers seem always to think other people
have lost their senses as well as yourselves, but it's only love
that's blind, my dear."
“Miss Pratt, I beg you will listen to me seriously, while I
assure you, in the most solemn manner, that
you are under a
complete delusion. For myself I can only be honoured by
such a supposition, but it is injurious, it is insulting to Miss
St. Clair, to have it imagined that she has already bestowed her
regards upon me, who am, in fact, still almost a stranger to her.”
Mr. Lyndsay spoke with that air of truth and sincerity
that would have carried conviction to any other mind.
“As to that, it doesn't take a lifetime to fall in love, and
your sudden love is always the strongest-many a one has
been over head and ears before

say
Jack Robinson.
I really don't see why you should take it so much to heart
when the lady puts up with it so quietly ; but more than that
I happened to hear something last night-I may as well tell
you what it was, if it was only to save you telling any more
fibs to me about it. I happened to be taking a turn through
the rooms last night, just to cool myself a little, after losing
seven points, all owing to your good uncle's obstinacy-when
I came to the-what-do-ye-call-it-room there—the door was
open, and there I heard the Colonel say, in a voice like any
lion,” raising hers in imitation, “You love that—that-(no
matter what)--that Edward Lyndsay, says he, and you've
deceived and bamboozled me. I know that you've given
your affections to him; but he shall answer for it, and so he
went on like any madman. I didn't hear so well what she
said, for, you know, she doesn't speak very loud; but I heard
her say that she couldn't and wouldn't endure such insolence,
and that he had no right to speak to her in that way. But
just then Lord Rossville was calling me to go and play the
game over again with him, and, at any rate, you know, I
wouldn't have stayed to listen.”
“All that is nothing to the purpose,” cried Mr. Lyndsay,
in some little emotion; " at least the only purpose is to show
how little dependence you ought to place on any of your
senses, since they must all have beguiled you in this matter.
You will, therefore, act a prudent part for yourself, and a
more delicate one towards Miss St. Clair, if you refrain from
making any such comments in future--be assured you will
only render yourself highly ridiculous"

141
"O! you needn't be afraid ; I'm not going to trouble my
head about the matter," returned Miss Pratt, reddening with
anger; “ but you'll not easily persuade me that I've lost my
senses, because I happen to have a little more penetration
than my neighbours." And away pattered the offended fair,
rather confirmed than shaken in her preconceived notions on
the subject.
Disbelieving, as he certainly did, the greater part of Miss
Pratt's communications, still it was not in nature that Mr.
Lyndsay should have felt altogether indifferent to them.
Although not a person to yield his affections lightly, he cer-
tainly had been charmed with Miss St. Clair's beauty and
grace--with the mingled vivacity and softness of her man-
ners, and with the open naïve cast of her character. There
was all to captivate a mind and taste such as his; but there
was still something wanting to render the charm complete.
Firm in his own religious principles, he vainly sought in Ger-
trude for any corresponding sentiments. Gertrude was reli-
gious—what mind of any excellence is not ?—but hers was the
religion of poetry—of taste-of feeling of impulse-of any
and every thing but Christianity. He saw much of fine na-
tural feeling-but in vain sought for any guiding principle of
duty. Her mind seemed as a lovely, flowery, pathless waste,
whose sweets exhaled in vain-all was graceful luxuriance-
but all was transient and perishable in its loveliness. No
plant of immortal growth grew there—no flowers worthy
of Paradise.”
Mr. Lyndsay had discernment to trace the leading features
of his cousin's mind, even through the veil which was cast
over it by Lord Rossville's tyranny and Mrs. St. Clair's arti-
fice. He saw her ardent, enthusiastic, and susceptible-but
rash, visionary, and unregulated; he feared she was in bad
hands, even in her mother's ; but he dreaded still more lest
Colonel Delmour should succeed in gaining her affections.
He suspected his design; and, from his previous knowledge
of his habits and principles, was convinced that such an union
would be the wreck of Gertrude's peace and happiness.
Since that strange and mysterious adventure in the wood
he had felt a still deeper interest in her, and he wished, if
possible, to gain her friendship and confidence, that he might
endeavour to save her from the snares with which she was
beset. In short, Lyndsay's feelings towards her were com-
pounded into one which could not have been easily defined-
it was neither love nor friendship, yet partook of the nature
of both for it had somewhat of the excitement of the one
with the disinterestedness of the other.
The mutual embarrassment of the cousins was not lessened

when they next met, and they seemed, by a sort of tacit
agreement, to avoid each other, which Miss Pratt set down as
a proof positive that there was a perfect understanding be-
tween them, but she was highly provoked that, with all her
watching and spying, she never could detect, stolen glances, or
soft whispers, or tête-à-tête walks, or private meetings, or any
of those various symptoms which so often enable single ladies
to anticipate and settle a marriage before it has been even
thought of by the parties themselves.
Not daring, however, to give utterance to her thoughts
where she was, and unable any longer to keep her discovery
pent up within her own bosom, she availed herself of the
opportunity of a free cast, as she called it, to make out her
visit to Lady Millbank; and there she accordingly betook
herself with her budget, containing, in strict confidence, all
the particulars of Colonel Delmour's refusal, his impertinent
perseverance, his frightening Miss St. Clair into hysterics by
his violence, &c., &c. Then came the history of Mr. Lyndsay's
acceptance-her own bright discoveries—a full and minute
description of the pearls, well garnished with conjectures as
to how it would all end, when Mr. Member came to poll, and
found another elected and returned. Some of these dark say-
ings she had even dared to throw out to Lord Rossville, but
his Lordship's thoughts were so engrossed by the realities of
electioneering that he had none to throw away upon it meta-
phorically.
Miss Pratt's departure was, as usual, a relief to the whole
party; but to none so much as to Miss St. Clair and Mr.
Lyndsay, who soon found themselves conversing together, if
not with their former ease, with more than their former
interest in each other. She could not be insensible to the
quiet elegance of his manners, and the superiority of his con-
versation, but yet she failed to do him justice; for, solely
occupied with one engrossing object, she merely sought in
any other wherewithal to lighten the tedium of his absence.
Two different pictures had been presented to her in the cha-
racters of the cousins—the one rich, varied, and brilliant in
its colouring—the other correct and beautiful in its outline.
The one attracting instant admiration—the other appreciated
only by the careful and discriminating. Had perfection itself
now been placed before her, it had failed to captivate the
heart, over which a dazzled imagination had cast its deceitful
hues. The idol of that heart had gained an absolute ascen-
dancy over her affections, and on it she looked, not with the
steady eye of sober truth, but with the fascinated gaze of
spell-bound illusion,

CHAPTER XXX.
The following letter was put into Gertrude's hand one morn-
ing:-
“ MY DEAR COUSIN,
“I feel encouraged to the liberty I am going to
take, by the kindness you showed me when at Bellevue.
Your good-will may now be the means of rendering me an
essential service, and I would feel myself to blame, if false
diffidence should hinder me from unbosoming myself to you.
I was several times on the point of explaining myself to you,
but thought I could more easily do it in writing, and now that
I take up my pen, I wish I had rather spoken to you, when
I had so many favourable opportunities. But why am I so
wavering and foolish, when I ought with con ce to
to Him who has promised to direct the Christian's path, and
who has promised that He will never leave nor forsake those
who put their trust in Him, and acknowledge Him in all their
ways? I must now trust to your patience, while I tell my
tale. A mutual attachment has subsisted between William
Leslie and myself from our earliest years; but he is poor,
and on that account, and that only, it is not sanctioned by my
parents-of course, you will believe that I never would enter
into so sacred a connection without their consent. I love and
reverence them too much, and, above all, I fear God, but
fain would I hope that, had he a competency, their prejudices
(for prejudices I must call them) would be overcome. Wil-
liam's choice was early pointed to the church, and his clerical
education has for some time been completely finished, but
hitherto all his efforts to procure a living have proved inef-
fectual. My father might assist him, but he is very luke-
warm in the cause, as both my mother and he declare they
cannot bear the idea of seeing me the wife of a poor minister.
But I have learnt that poverty is a comparative thing, and
that a competence to some is riches, while to others wealth
seems little better than splendid want. It is true, riches will
be denied me, but the greater blessings of peace and mutual
affection may, by the blessing of God, be my happy lot.
Even when called upon to endure hardship and privations,
our souls will not be cast down, for with one heart and one
faith, we will cheerfully bear the crosses of this life, looking
forward to the inseparable and everlasting happiness of that
which is to come.

“Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,' than to sit in
the joyless ease of indifference amidst heartless grandeur, or
to drink the bitter cup of variance. Ah! my dear cousin,
God only can put gladness in the heart, and 'tis not by the
world or the things of the world. If, as I believe, religion
be indeed the soul of happiness, then may I reasonably hope
for that peace which the world cannot give, with one whom I
have known and loved from my earliest years, and whose
faith and practice are those of a follower of Jesus Christ.
“ This attachment is no phantom of a heated imagination.
Our mutual love is now a principle—it cannot be extinguished,
but it may be sacrificed to a still more sacred claim. I again
repeat, I never will marry without the consent and blessing
of my parents, but were my dear William provided for, I
think their pride would yield to their stronger feeling of
affection for me. Yet I almost blush to trouble you with my
selfish concerns, though I know you will befriend me if you
can. The church of Clearburn is in Lord Rossville's gift-
the present incumbent is old and infirm, and an assistant and
successor is to be immediately appointed. I do not ask you
to recommend William Leslie, because you ought not to re-
commend one to fill so sacred an office who is utterly un-
known to you; but if you would name him to Lord Rossville
-if you would request of him to inquire into his character
and qualifications of those who can judge of them, and then
if you will support him with your influence, you will confer
a heartfelt obligation on your faithful and affectionate cousin,
" ANNE BLACK."
To feel and to act were with Gertrude commonly one and
the same thing-reflection seldom was allowed to interpose
its cooling influence, and scarcely had she finished reading
the letter when she flew to Lord Rossville to ask (and she
had no doubt to obtain) the boon solicited. She found the
Earl alone in his study, surrounded with papers and parch-
ments, and looking, if possible, even more than usually por-
tentous.
“I am come, my Lord, to ask—to beg a favour,"—she be-
gan, almost breathless from haste and emotion.
“Miss St. Clair, this is rather an interruption; but be
seated—be seated-and be composed. You, and indeed all
who have any claims upon my time, influence, or assistance,
will ever find my ear open to the voice of proper solicitation;
therefore, I again repeat, be composed, and allow this flow of
spirits to subside, ere you commence.
“O, it is nothing-I only feel a little afraid, lest you should
think me too presuming when I ask-but I believe the peti-

and she put ter cousin's letter into his Lordship’s hands,
with very sanguine anticipations as to the result.
Lord Rossville perused it in silence; but his looks became
darker at every line, and his head shook, or rather trembled,
from beginning to end.
“A most wild, dangerous, and improper letter," said he,
when he finished it, vainly endeavouring to speak quicker-
“I am pained to think that such a letter should have been
addressed to you—that such a letter should have been pre-
sented by you to me,”—and his Lordship walked up and
down the room in composed discomposure, while Gertrude
remained aghast and motionless, at seeing her church in the
air thus vanish “ like the baseless fabric of a vision."
possible, Miss St. Clair,”—asked he, his hand slowly rising-
“is it possible that you had perused this letter ?” pointing
with his obstinate-looking fingers to the paper in question-
“And is it possible that, having read, you can also sanction,
and approve, and assist a young female in setting up her own
judgment in opposition to the known will and intention of
her parents, and to the opinion and approval of the world in
general ?"
Although my,
cousin is so unfortunate as to differ from
her parents on that subject,” said Gertrude, timidly, “she
declares that she will not disobey them.”
“Not disobey them ?-Good Heavens! Miss St. Clair,
what do you term disobedience ?" The dignity of this appeal
was interrupted by a cough. “I have lived longer in the
world, and have seen rather more of mankind than you have
done, and I do not hesitate to say, that the principles con-
tained in this letter, if acted upon by the bulk of mankind,
(and it is only by generalising principles that we can fairly
bring them to the test,) must eventually prove highly de-
structive to the present order of things, inasmuch as they
are totally, subversive of all filial obedience and parental
authority.
Gertrude was much at a loss to answer this tirade, which
confounded, without in the smallest degree convincing her.
Again, however, she tried to urge something in extenuation ;
but it was, as Jeremy Taylor expresses it, treading on the
corns of his Lordship’s mind to attack any of his opinions or
prejudices; and it was resented accordingly.
“I own I am distressed-mortified-shocked-Miss St.
Clair, that a letter containing such sentiments should be
advocated by you; sentiments fraught with so much mischief
-principles destructive of the mutual relationship of parent
and child-wild, fantastical, new-fangled notions, setting at

defiance all proper doctrines of religion, and only calculated
to disturb, and finally abolish all orders of society; and yet
it is such-such-I say I should consider myself as acting a
most highly culpable part, were I to lend the smallest coun-
tenance or sanction to such measures;”—and he walked up
and down the room, his shoes creaking at every step.—“Mr.
Black is a sensible, well-principled man, and obviously views
the matter in the same light as I do, and as, indeed, all per-
sons of a right way of thinking should do. A young female
to presume to judge for herself, in opposition to the wishes of
her parents-to the opinion of the world—to the general
voice of mankind, and to seek to—to assume the mask of
religion, in order to—to stifle the voice of duty, it is lament-
able—it is deplorable—it is monstrous ! What was it but by
such steps as these the established order of things in a neigh-
bouring country was gradually undermined, and at length
finally overthrown ?-It was by such steps as these” (knock-
ing the letter slowly with his knuckles)“ that the altar and
the throne, religion and-and-and loyalty, and—and sound
morality, all that were formerly held sacred, fell sacrifices to
these very levelling principles ;”—and he threw the letter
from him with all the energy of virtuous indignation.
Gertrude could scarcely refrain from smiling at the idea of
Anne Black's marriage endangering church and state ; and
something of that sort she ventured to express.
“I beg pardon, my Lord,” said she, “but, even supposing
my cousin's marriage were to take place, I cannot perceive
any bad consequences that would result from it, unless to
herself."
“ You do not perceive-you do not perceive the pernicious
effects of such an example operating on young females in the
same sphere ?-operating, too, under my sanction and coun-
tenance-and-and-and-and I to become the patron of re-
bellious undutiful children the conniver at low and im-
proper and clandestine connections! Were such a precedent
once established, where is it to end? You yourself, I shall
suppose, for the sake of illustrating my argument—you pre-
suming upon my licence in this instance, deem yourself
authorised to select, choose-and-and-and declare, that
you will select and choose-nay, that you have selected and
chosen a~a partner for yourself
, not only without my con-
currence, but in direct opposition and contradiction
my
will and authority. I ask, would not such behaviour on your
part be- I do not scruple to say-monstrous ?”
Gertrude was not prepared for this digression, but she saw
by his Lordship's bend, that an answer was expected, and in
some trepidation she replied, -

“I hope it never will be my misfortune to differ from your
Lordship on this subject. But if it should-
in much agitation.
“You hope it will never be your misfortune to differ from
me!” repeated his Lordship, with a very dissatisfied look,
“ that is a style of language, Miss St. Clair, I own, which
does not satisfy me. On that subject I can allow no differ-
ences. No young lady, of a right way of thinking, ought or
can have a different opinion on so important a point, from
those whom it is her duty to reverence and obey."
His Lordship paused, and seemed to be revolving some
mighty matter in his mind, and Gertrude, trembling at what
this might lead to, rose, and taking up her cousin's letter was
preparing to leave the room, when her uncle motioned with
his hand for her to resume her seat; then in a slow, solemn
tone, spoke as follows :-
"It certainly formed no part of my original plan with
regard to you, that, at this early stage of your existence, you
should have been made acquainted with the plans I had
formed and laid down for your final disposal; but, from what
has passed, I am inclined to think, that, in deviating from my
former
purpose, I shall do wisely and well.” He then pro-
ceeded in the same prolix manner to unfold to Gertrude the
future web of her life, as spun and wove by his Lordship’s
own hand-or rather head.
Gertrude heard, without surprise, but not without emotion,
that she was the destined wife of Mr. Delmour, and, in that
light, was considered by him, and by all the members of the
family, and by all the freeholders in the county, and her
heart glowed with resentment at the thoughts of any one
having thus dared to appropriate her without her own con-
sent. Scarcely could she listen with patience, while Lord
Rossville detailed, in the most minute, yet guarded manner,
his plans with regard to her future establishment, as if afraid
of making her too happy, or raising her expectations too high.
Thus, after having settled everything regarding her mar-
riage, with more than a lawyer's punctilio, he hastened to
undo his own work in the same breath, by adding, that it was
not his intention that the marriage should take place until
she had attained the age of twenty-one, at soonest; perhaps
not even then, as he was no advocate for early alliances—that
is, too early. “There was a time for all things, and that
time must be regulated by circumstances; but, in the mean-
time-
“In the meantime, my Lord,” cried Gertrude, with great
emotion, "I must be allowed to disclaim any engagement
with Mr. Delmour."
"

The Earl regarded her for some moments with the greatest
astonishment, and seemed as if wholly bereft of the power of
expressing the indignation which swelled in his bosom almost
to suffocation, at this act of overt rebellion. At length he
found words, though ideas were still wanting.
“What am I to understand from this most extraordinary
speech, Miss St. Clair ?” interrogated he, with some diffi-
culty.
Gertrude, in much emotion, but with the utmost gentle-
ness of manner, repeated her words.
“ Allowed to disclaim any engagement with Mr. Delmour !
a most extraordinary proposal at such a time !-at a time
when so much is at stake-a most improper, nay, a most in-
delicate proposal in the present posture of affairs.”
His Lordship cleared his voice, hemmed, coughed, and
proceeded :-"You cannot be ignorant, Miss St. Clair, of the
very important contest at present carrying on in this county
-a contest which is of vital importance to the power and
consequence of this family—and, I may add, of some interest
to the country at large; as, in these times of anarchy and
rebellion, when the throne and the Government are assailed
on all sides by factions and turbulent demagogues, it is of
the utmost importance that our representation in Parliament
be sound, loyal, and patriotic, if we expect that our religion
and laws may be preserved, and handed down unimpaired to
our posterity."
Her assent seemed to be expected to this opening speech ;
but Gertrude could make none.
The Earl went on.-
“You are probably not aware of the motives which have
actuated me in thus developing my schemes and intentions to
you, and to the world in general, at this period; and, in doing
so, I certainly have deviated from my original plan; but we
must all occasionally be regulated by circumstances ; and, I
think, I have only to state to you, that the success of this
most important political contest depends very considerably
upon the understanding that Mr. Delmour will eventually,
and in all probability, one day become, through your instru-
mentality, the lawful possessor of the family estates in this
county, to grant your hearty concurrence in the proposed
arrangement :-in one word, I could not with propriety offer
Mr. Delmour as the representative of this county (he having
little more than a nominal interest in it at present), unless
-as the-as the, in all likelihood—the intended husband of
the presumptive (observe, I say presumptive, not apparent)
heiress of Rossville."
His Lordship was so much pleased with the eloquence and

149
brilliancy of his harangue, that, as he went on, he gradually
spoke himself into good-humour; and by the time it was
ended, he had almost forgotten the origin of his elocution.
Gertrude remained silent, struggling with contending feel-
ings. On the one hand was the fear of betraying her secret
predilection for Colonel Delmour; on the other her scorn
and detestation of everything resembling duplicity and deceit.
At length, her natural love of truth and candour prevailed,
and, mustering courage, she said, -
"Much as it pains me to oppose you, my dear uncle, yet I
should be still more unworthy your affection, were I to leave
you in an error: forgive me"—she paused, her heart throbbed,
and her colour rose" forgive me, I will not deceive you. I
cannot sanction the engagement you have formed for me-I
never can be the wife of Mr. Delmour."
This was something so far beyond what Lord Rossville
could have anticipated, that it was some time ere the fact
could find admittance to his brain, choked up as it always
was with his own notions. While the process of conviction
was carrying on, he, therefore, sat as if petrified. At length,
the light began to penetrate the dim opaque of his under-
standing ; but his Lordship had, as usual, recourse to other
people's words, till he could muster his own forces.
“Never can be the wife of Mr. Delmour l" repeated he in
the tone of one who was not quite sure whether he were
asleep or awake. — “Not sanction the engagement I have
formed for you! What—what, in the name of Heaven, am I
to understand from such language, Miss St. Clair?"
The understanding seemed so perfectly obvious, that Ger-
trude felt much at a loss how to make it clearer. The ques-
tion was again repeated.
“ Excuse me, my Lord, but Mr. Delmour is not the person
I--but, indeed, I do not know how to express myself in a
manner less likely to offend. I would say, that I wish to be
left free, that I might be allowed to choose in so import-
ant-
“ You wish to be left free !-You wish to be allowed to
choose in so important ! -hem !_Really, Miss St. Clair, I
am too much astonished at the-the-the-the-the-the-
what shall I call it ?—the unwarrantable levity of such a pro-
posal, to answer it as I ought. You wish to be left free to
choose ! and that in a point of such vast—such vital import-
ancel-astonishing! Are you aware in what capacity it is
that a suitable alliance is formed for you ?-_That it is not as
simple Miss St. Clair, and daughter of the Honourable Thomas
St. Clair, but as niece to the Ěarl of Rossville, and presump-
tive heiress to the title and estates thereof; with the excep-

tion of the Barony of Larchdale, which, by deed of entail of
Alexander, first Earl of Rossville, devolves upon the heirs
male of the family; and, therefore, it is to consolidate these
properties, that they may be again reunited in the persons of
your mutual heir or heirs,—an arrangement which has Mr.
Delmour's entire approbation. I say, that, under these cir-
cumstances, there is not—there cannot—there must not, be
a choice in the matter ;-—but, indeed, I am very much at a
loss to know what to understand by such an expression. I
certainly have not been accustomed to hear of young ladies
of family, and fortune, and distinction, choosing for them-
selves in their matrimonial course. I can only say, for my
own part, I-I-had no choice.” Gertrude could scarcely
restrain a smile at hearing Lord Rossville quote himself as a
pattern to be followed, instead of a rock to be shunned ;-but
such is the blindness of human nature, we are all but too apt
to hold ourselves up as guides, when we ought to be satisfied
to serve as beacons.
“ Allowed to choose !-1-1-and pray, Miss St. Clair,
supposing, for one moment, it was so-where, I ask-where
would you—where could you find such another gentleman as
Mr. Delmour—a gentleman of birth and fashion-of fine ad-
dress of appearance - of accomplishments — possessing a
first-rate understanding, of which he has already given un-
doubted proofs to the world, by having been appointed one
of the Financial Committee, which, for so young a man, I
consider as a very distinguished mark of pre-eminence?-A
man of fine person- of sound principles-of devoted loyalty-
of high political consideration; but who, notwithstanding all
those advantages, yet submits himself, in this case, solely to
my guidance and management; I ask again, where could you
find such another perfect gentleman ?"
“I acknowledge Mr. Delmour's good qualities, my Lord-
so far as I can pretend to judge of them upon so slight an
acquaintance," answered Gertrude hesitatingly; " but pray
forgive me, if I still repeat, that I must be allowed to con-
sider myself as perfectly disengaged.”
" Miss St. Clair,” cried the Earl, now absolutely gasping-
“I can only say, that—that if you persist—if you presume to
report yourself throughout the county as-as--as disengaged
-I -” the pulse of life seemed to stand still, and “nature
made a pause, an awful pause, prophetic of its end.”—The
clenched hand was slowly uplifted-then descended with a
weight that shook the table.--"I cannot answer for the con-
sequences !" This is a threat which always forms a happy
climax to an argument from its vagueness, and consequently
its sublimity.

At that moment the party in question entered—his hands
full of open letters, and with an air of bustle and business,
not at all calculated to fascinate a romantic imagination such
as Gertrude's. He was beginning some rather formal and
complimentary apology for his interruption, when she rose,
and in some confusion stammered out a few words in reply,
then bowing to the Earl, was retiring, when Mr. Delmour
begged to know whether she had any friends in the western
extremity of the county, as he was afraid he should be under
the necessity of setting off for that quarter immediately, and
should be much honoured by being the bearer of Miss St.
Clair's commands.
Gertrude disclaimed all interest in that part of the county,
and, scarcely able to express the common civilities of parting,
hastily withdrew.
CHAPTER XXXI.
In every generous mind there is a spring, which, if touched
rightly, yields fine issues, but if struck by an unskilful hand,
produces only discord. So it was with Gertrude-affection
would have led her-reason might_have guided—but mere
authority could never control her. To one of an independent
spirit, nothing, therefore, could be more irksome than the
situation in which she was placed.
With regard to her uncle, his right to control her seemed
very doubtful; and, indeed, the authority of uncles commonly
comes in a very questionable shape, and is, perhaps, only to
be considered as binding, when the uncle has received autho-
rity from a living parent, or has early and long supplied the
place of a departed one. As for aunts, they are in general
accustomed to dictate, but are seldom so unreasonable as to
expect to be obeyed. Yet love and tenderness, almost ma-
ternal, have sometimes given them a power over a young and
affectionate heart, which all the violence of improper autho-
rity never could have obtained. These would have subdued
a mind such as Gertrude's, but those gentle weapons were
unknown, and unused either by Lord Rossville or Mrs.
St. Clair. Authority with the one, artifice with the other,
were the means used to gain their different purposes with
one whom opposite methods would have rendered submissive
as a child, and open as noon-day.
Gertrude's first impulse was to hasten to her mother, and
relate to her all that passed betwixt Lord Rossville and her

-she expected to encounter reproaches; but Mrs. St. Clair
seemed almost frantic at her daughter's disclosure, and abso-
lutely shook with terror, while she listened to Gertrude's ac-
count of what had passed. But ere she had time to express her
sentiments on the subject, a message was brought from the Earl,
requesting her presence for half an hour in his study. It
was easy to guess at the subject in hand, and Mrs. St. Clair,
though in great agitation, instantly obeyed the summons.
Gertrude waited with impatience for nearly an hour and a
halt, ere the conference was ended, and her mother appeared.
When she did, she read vexation and discomfiture in her
countenance. She was, however, too prudent to express her
feelings, but contented herself with saying, that she had
found Lord Rossville in great displeasure against his niece,
and had left him quite immovable as to the proposed alliance
and declared engagement—and this was all Gertrude could
draw from her mother. She, therefore, sat down to answer
the unfortunate letter that had been the innocent cause of
this premature éclaircissement,' which she did by lamenting
her present inability to aid her cousin in any shape, but con-
cluding with the warmest assurances of regard and promises
of assistance, should it ever be in her power to befriend her.
She was then preparing to dress for dinner, when the follow-
ing note was presented to her:
“ The Earl of Rossville presents compliments to Miss St.
Clair, and while matters remain in their present unpleasant
position, and until some arrangement of an amicable nature
has taken place, it is his wish and expectation that Miss St.
Clair should confine herself to her own apartment—it may be
presumed from indisposition. .
“ Rossville Castle, 29th Aug. 18—,"
His Lordship, when he perused this master-piece of a bil-
let, had fondly imagined it would speak daggers to the soul
of his niece, and he piqued himself not a little at the finesse
of punishing her in this exemplary manner, and at the same
time keeping her transgression a secret from the rest of the
family, whom he wished to remain in ignorance of this defiance
of his power. Gertrude, of course, complied with this
embargo, and left to her mother to give what name she
pleased to her disorder. A week elapsed, and Gertrude still
remained in durance, but she bore her imprisonment with
great heroism, and its languid hours were enlivened by a
packet received through some unknown channel from Colonel
Delmour. It affected to be merely a parcel of music ; but it
contained a letter full of all that love-letters are usually full

153
VOWS -
of-hopes—fears — lamentations
reproaches-rap-
tures-despair. It may be supposed this did not tend to
render Gertrude more compliant to her uncle's wishes; and
his Lordship was beginning to feel much at a loss how to
proceed, when all the combustible particles of his composition
were roused into action, and he hastened to array himself in
all his honours, and take the field in full force. The report
of his niece's engagement with Mr. Lyndsay had, by the
ingenuity of Miss Pratt, quickly circulated throughout the
county, and had resounded and reverberated from all the
corners of it, before the last echo reached the dull ear of
Lord Rossville ; but when it did, it produced all the effect of
a thunderbolt upon his senses.- Not that he could all at once
give credit to such a monstrous supposition, but it was quite
bad enough that the thing should be said, or for one instant
believed. As soon as he recovered so far as to be able to
ruminate, he therefore resolved upon his plan of proceeding ;
and, as the first step, summoned his niece to his presence.
For some minutes he regarded her with a look which he
vainly expected would cause her to sink to the ground-for
the Earl thought of expression, as Glendower did of spirits,
that he had only to call them, and they would come. After
waiting in vain for the effects he had anticipated, his Lordship
found he must have recourse to his voice-not that he was
averse to using that, but having witnessed the magic influ-
ence of a Siddons and a Kean, he had no doubt but that he
too could look unutterable things; and he had intended first
to kill with the lightning of his eye, and then to revive with
the gracious sound of his voice. All this he had intended ;
liut how often are the best intentions frustated !
Gertrude was quite ignorant of these intentions, and in her
uncle's persevering stare saw nothing but a stare, which being
always a disagreeable thing, she sought to avoid by casting
down her eyes. Still having somewhere read that women
can see even with their eyes shut, Lord Rossville flattered
himself, that his piercing gaze would penetrate through the
eyelids of his niece, and he waited a little longer in hopes of
seeing her at his feet.
At length she raised her eyes, but it was to exclaim at
seeing a hawk dart past the window in pursuit of a dove.
The Earl now spoke.
“Miss St. Clair, look at me."
Gertrude obeyed, and did look, but with an expression which
seemed to say-And what then?
“Look at me, Miss St. Clair, if, indeed, it is possible for
you to meet my eye, after what has recently come to my
knowledge-Miss St. Clair, this is neither a subject nor a

time for trifling, and I will have neither equivocation nor
prevarication—I ask you again—and I warn you to be cautious
how and in what manner you frame your reply-I ask you
again, are you willing to be restored to my favour and pro-
tection, upon the terms I proposed, namely, that you consider
yourself as engaged, and as having been for some time past
engaged, to Robert Burlington Delmour, Esquire, Member
of Parliament, the heir male of this family; and do you con-
sent that the nuptials be solemnised at such time as I shall
deem proper?”
“My Lord, I grieve that I cannot obey you ; but I will
not deceive you.
Mr. Delmour has my good wishes-my
affections," she stopped and coloured deeply; then added,
in a low voice,“ are not mine to bestow !"
Lord Rossville was struck dumb at this daring avowal,
which seemed to mock the thunderbolt he held in his hand,
ready to hurl when the proper moment came.
6 Miss St. Clair,” gaspedhe at length, "are you aware of
the construction that may be put upon such language ?—that
it amounts, in the ordinary language of the world, to an
avowal or confession of a very particular, I may add, im-
proper nature? Miss St. Clair, what am I to understand
from such a declaration-a declaration which, in the eyes of
the world, would be considered as tantamount to an express,
and direct, and explicit declaration of a prior and illegal
attachment, unsanctioned by me?"
Gertrude bowed her head, either to hide her blushes, or to
testify her assent. The Earl resumed-
“Miss St. Clair, my delicacy would have spared you this
--to you humiliating-to me distressing avowal ; but you
have thrown aside the disguise which-which-which—but I
must now inform you, that I am no stranger to this most
improper, unaccountable, and unjustifiable transaction; and
that, as the preliminary step towards gaining my forgiveness
for this, I must say, unpardonable offence, I must insist upon
a complete and total renunciation of all further intercourse
with the party implicated."
“My Lord,” said Gertrude, trying to repress her tears,
“I can only repeat what I have already said ; I am sensible
of your goodness, I grieve that I should have offended you ;
but I never will renounce the right of choosing for myself-
that choice is made-would it were one more pleasing to your
Lordship.”
“Miss St. Clair, I will not hear another syllable,” cried the
Earl, with an energy unparalleled in the annals of his life and
conversation; "I here lay my positive injunctions upon
you to refrain from speaking, thinking, or acting any further

in this most faulty and improper transaction, and I shall, at
the same time, signify to the other party concerned, that,
from this time, he likewise must cease to presume to consider
you in any other light than that which the present relation-

No, my Lord,” cried Gertrude, in her turn roused by
such opprobrious epithets, "you cannot annul the affections
of the heart. I am not a slave, to be thus bought and sold,"
exclaimed she, giving way to her long-suppressed tears.
“Miss St. Clair, such language-such sentiments—are no
less unbecoming for you to utter than they are improper for
me to hear. I will listen to nothing more of the kind, but it
is proper you should be made acquainted with what
you
have
to expect from me should you persist in this obstinate and
infatuated and destructive course in which you have begun.
You are then to learn that, in the event of your persisting in
your headstrong and unaccountable refusal to fulfil the en-
gagement I have contracted for you with the heir male of
this family, it is my firm resolution, and final determination,
instantly to withdraw from you my countenance, alienate
from
you

every sixpence of property, herita-
ble and personal, which it is in my power to dispose of; and
further, there is good reason to believe that it will bear a
question whether I am not at liberty, under the deed of
Simon, second Earl of Rossville, to dispone and bequeath the
whole of the lands and estates according to my will and plea-
At all events the right of tying them up for an indefi-
nite term of years is undoubted, and shall most unquestion-
ably be put in force. You have, therefore, to choose betwixt
an annual income of 20,0001., to which you are at present
presumptive heiress (that is eventually), or to sink at once
into comparative poverty, and insignificance, and obscurity."
“My choice is made, my Lord,” said Gertrude, instantly
calmed into the most perfect composure.
“ Then, Miss St. Clair, you know, and are fully aware of
the consequences."
Gertrude only bent her head in silent acquiescence, and,
rising to leave the room, the Earl rang the bell with rather
more of energy than was his custom, and, as she retired, she
heard him desire that Mr. Lyndsay might attend him imme-
diately.

THE INDERITANCE,
CHAPTER XXXII.
TAERE is nothing tends so much to brace the nerves, and
keep up the tone of the spirits, as the sense of having been
treated with injustice. For some time, therefore, Gertrude
felt as though she had gained a triumph by the sacrifice she
had made to her lover; she exulted in the thought of thus
proving to him the sincerity and the devotedness of her af-
fection, and delighted her fond and simple fancy by imagining
how much dearer she would be to him as the (for his sake)
poor Gertrude St. Clair than she ever could have been as the
heiress of Rossville. But the first glow of enthusiasm over,
she sighed as she thought, “Yet how sweet would have been
the pleasure of bestowing upon him all that I now see—these
noble woods—this far-spreading domain I had hoped to have
made him master of! They tell me he is expensive, that is,
he has a magnificent taste, and loves show and splendour,
and pictures, and fine horses, and everything that is beauti-
ful. Ah! how happy I should have been in the means of
gratifying him, and of making him so happy-oh! so happy,
that he should have had nothing to wish for-yet all these
he will sacrifice for me, for he has often declared my affec-
tion was all the world to him. What signifies then the loss
of wealth to those who can be rich in mutual love? Thus
communed Gertrude with herself, and at eighteen who would
not have done the same ?
Meanwhile the Earl was somewhat at a loss what course to
pursue with the other supposed offender, Mr. Lyndsay. His
Lordship, unknown to himself, had that sort of intuitive re-
spect for his nephew which weak minds, however against
their grain, must always feel towards strong ones; but he
still trusted to his powers of expression, and, therefore, ar-
ranged his aspect as nearly as he could into that cast with
which he imagined Brutus had passed sentence on his sons.
But looks were as much thrown away upon Mr. Lyndsay as
they had been upon Gertrude; that gentleman testified no
sort of emotion whatever at beholding his Lordship’s brows
bent full upon him, and the Earl again found himself reduced
to the vulgar method of explaining himself in words. He
then entered upon a speech, which, for intricacy of design
and uselessness of purpose, inight have vied with the far-
famed labyrinth of Crete. Poor Mr. Lyndsay toiled after
him in vain, quite unable even to conjecture where his Lord-
ship was driving, and what was to be the issue of his tortuous

harangue. At length the Earl emerged from the dim eclipse
in which, shorn of his beams, he had so long shed disastrous
twilight, if not upon nations, at least upon individuals, and
the truth burst upon Lyndsay's almost benighted senses. For
a moment a strange glow of delight came over his heart at
hearing himself called upon to renounce all claim to the hand
and affections of Miss St. Clair, but it as quickly faded as he
thought of the difference of their views and sentiments, and
he smiled in scorn at his own credulity for having, for an
instant, given ear to such a delusion. " It is impossible for
me to relinquish what I never possessed," said he in answer
to the Earl's appeal ; nor can I even flatter myself it is in
my power to obtain. This is some of Miss Pratt's idle ru-
mours, which have found their way to your Lordship's ear;
believe me they are quite unworthy of a moment's con-
sideration."
But it was in vain to hold this language to Lord Rossville ;
it was seldom an idea found entrance into his head, and when
once there it was no easy matter to dislodge it-it became,
not the mere furniture of the head, to be turned or changed
at will, but seemed actually to become a part of the head
itself, which it required a sort of mental scalping or trepan-
ning to remove. În vain, therefore, was Mr. Lyndsay's de-
nial--the Earl remained steadfast in his belief, and rejected
the idea of Miss Pratt with the greatest contempt. He"
perfectly informed of the whole
from authority it was impos-
sible to question.” He then went over the same ground he
had taken with Gertrude the loss of his countenance-the
breaking of the entail-the tying up of the property, &c.
“Were I, as you imagine, honoured with Miss Št. Clair's
partiality,” said Lyndsay, “I must frankly tell you that all
you have now said would not have the slightest influence
upon me.
I hope it never will have upon the man who is so
fortunate as to gain her affections. Much as he may value your
Lordship’s favour, and the Rossville estates, I trust he will
never put either of them in competition with Miss St. Clair."
This was past answering. Lord Rossville took two or three
turns through the room before he could trust himself to
reply, then spoke-
“ Mr. Lyndsay, I can only impute this tergiversation of
yours (to call it by no harsher name) to a very mistaken and
destructive sense of honour ; but what will you say, sir,
when I inform you that not many minutes have elapsed
since, in this very apartment, and on this very spot, I received
from the lips of the young lady herself, the open and avowed
acknowledgment of her-her-her—what shall I call it ?
-her highly improper attachment to, and engagement with
yourself"

TAE INHERITANCE.
"Impossible!” exclaimed Mr. Lyndsay, his face flushing
with a variety of contending emotions ; "she did not-she
could not say so."
Mr. Lyndsay knew his uncle to be a weak, tiresome, con-
ceited man, but he also knew him to be a man of perfect
veracity—one who, at least, always intended to speak the
truth. Such an unqualified assertion, therefore, as that he
had just made, could not fail to be heard by him with some
emotion, however mingled with incredulity.
Lord Rossville, in great displeasure that his word should be
doubted, repeated his nephew's last words with more than
usual pompous indignation, then added—“I should deem it
derogatory to myself to insist further upon this subject. I
can only repeat, and that upon the honour of a peer, that I
have received from Miss St. Clair the avowal of her clan-
destine attachment to you, and further heard her assert and
maintain her right to make such a choice.”
“Enough, my Lord,” cried Mr. Lyndsay ; " 'tis in vain to
attempt to answer such assertions at present—but I shall en-
deavour to furnish you with some explanation of this mystery
ere long." And he hastily withdrew, despairing of any elu-
cidation from Lord Rossville. Yet how or where to find it
he knew not, still less could he form any plausible conjecture
as to the truth ; there was none to whom he could apply, for
there was no one on whose judgment or principles he could
place any reliance. At one time he thought, was it possible
Gertrude could be playing false, and using his name as a
cover to some clandestine engagement - the stranger ?-
Colonel Delmour ?-but the next minute he checked the idea
as unworthy of her, of himself. Whatever her faults might
be, duplicity certainly was not of the number—there was an
air and expression of candour and openness in her counte-
nance, manners, words, which placed her above the meanness
of suspicion. At length he resolved to seek her himself, arid
try whether he could not penetrate this mystery.
Gertrude had remained standing at the window of one of
the public rooms she had to pass through in leaving Lord
Rossville's apartment—she had been gazing with a vague
mingled feeling of pride and regret at the lovely scene that
lay before her in all the glowing tints of autumn, when she
was aroused from her reverie by the entrance of Mr. Lynd-
say. He accosted her with an inquiry after her health, and
then one of those awkward silences which everybody has
felt, ensued. At length, as she turned to quit the room he
spoke.“
dear cousin,” said he, "you conferred upon me
the privilege of a friend--that of speaking the truth to you."
" It is one you have hitherto made little use of,” replied

"
she; then, deeply colouring as the thoughts of the midnight
rencontre rushed into her mind, she added, "I have, perhaps,
no right to expect, that Mr. Lyndsay should do what cir-
cumstances must have rendered so disagreeable a task for
him."
“You wrong yourself and me by such a supposition," said
he. “ However inexplicable some things may appear, a few
words of truth, I am very sure, will set all to rights.”
“No!", exclaimed Gertrude, in much agitation ; " inex-
plicable I must still remain to you-ask me nothing-I
cannot, indeed, I cannot answer any questions."
“Gertrude," said Mr. Lyndsay, with great emotion, "it is
essential to my happiness—perhaps to yours—that we should
understand each other.” He paused, then, by a strong effort,
proceeded, “ You will call it folly, presumption, madness,
when I tell you that Lord Rossville, under the influence of
some unaccountable delusion, has called upon me to resign
all pretensions to your favour-to your hand He
stopped, and Gertrude, overwhelmed with surprise and con-
fusion, remained silent.
“ Had I dared to aspire to it," continued he in increasing
agitation, “I know no earthly motive that would have in-
duced me to relinquish my claims—but, Gertrude," and he
would have taken her hand, but, roused to self-possession,
she saw there was only one course she could now pursue
she must throw herself upon the generocity of her cousin-
she must confide to him the secret of her attachment to Colo-
nel Delmour-noble and disinterested as he was, she knew
him to be incapable of abusing her confidence, and, with a
mixture of embarrassment and simplicity, she disclosed to him
the situation in which she stood.
Mr. Lyndsay heard her with the deepest interest, while
she lamented the misunderstanding that had occurred with
her uncle, and avowed that her affections were no longer her
own to bestow; but when, with faltering tongue, and down-
cast eyes, she named Colonel Delmour as the object of her
choice, a shade of anguish overcast his face.
66 'Tis then as I feared !” exclaimed he.
" Ah! Gertrude,
would I could have saved you from this !"
“Saved me!" repeated Gertrude, colouring deeply with
shame and displeasure as she turned away.
“ Forgive me, my dear cousin,” cried he-"I did not mean
to offend you—I spoke too abruptly; but I cannot retract
what I have uttered. Did not you promise to hear and to
bear the truth from me ?”
“I was ignorant then, that, under the name of truth, I was
to be called upon to give ear to detraction, and detraction
against the absent."

clear up
Lyndsay looked upon her more in sorrow than in anger,
while he answered— Yet, if you saw one in whom you were
interested on the brink of a precipice, would any considera-
tion withhold you from giving them warning of their danger-
from saving them, if you possibly could ? But do not injure
me so far-do not suppose me so base as to have said to you
what I have not said—what I will not again repeat to Colo-
nel Delmour himself. I have warned him, that I would do
all in my power to save you from ever becoming his, if that
is detraction-
“ Be it what it may," cried Gertrude, "I will hear no
more-already I have heard too much ;” and her voice qui-
vered with emotion ; “I will go to Lord Rossville, I will
this error-be the consequences to myself what they
may;” and rejecting Lyndsay's effort to detain her, she flew
to Lord Rossville, and, in all the excitement of wounded
feeling, acknowledged Colonel Delmour as the object of her
preference.
It was some time ere the Earl could open his eyes to this
flood of new light; but when he did, long and tiresome was
the scene that ensued. This was worse and worse, to have
chosen the wrong brother; 'twas strange, 'twas passing
strange; and a parallel was drawn betwixt the two brothers,
that, in his Lordship's estimation at least, might have rivalled
that of Hamlet. In vain was he denounced; even had she
credited the aspersions cast upon him, they would have now
come too late ; they might grieve, but they could not change
her heart. At length, the whole concluded with her being
discarded from her uncle's presence and protection. Mrs.
St. Clair was next summoned, and a long consultation ensued.
Her anger and dismay were at least equal to the Earl's,
though caused by different views of the same subject. How
to dispose of the offender was the next question. To permit
her to bask in the light of his Lordship’s countenance, even
while under excommunication, would never do ; yet to con-
fine her to her apartment, or discard her utterly, would be
making the matter public. And as he had no doubt he would
ultimately prevail, he was anxious, he said, that the flame of
rebellion should not be seen until he had fairly extinguished
it. In this emergency, the only course Mrs. St. Clair could
suggest was, that her daughter and she should pay a visit to
her sisters. To this his Lordship at first objected; but, upon
hearing that they lived in the most retired melancholy man-
ner, and that it would be a perfect act of penance for Ger-
trude to reside there, he consented. Under pretence of
change of air, therefore, for Miss St. Clair's cold, it was set-
tled that they should immediately depart; and the necessary
arrangements having been made, for the sake of appearances,

and, as he expressed it, to stifle any unpleasant surmises to
which this hasty removal might have given birth, they were
escorted to the carriage by the Earl himself; he actually
handed in Mrs. St. Clair, but only appeared to assist Ger-
trude, thus preserving the beautitul unity of his design to the
last.
CHAPTER XXXIII.
Mrs. St. Clair grew impatient under the secret sense of her
sisters' superiority, and weary of their simple uniform style
of living." Her habits were luxurious—her mind was joyless.
Gertrude, too, in all the restlessness of suspense, longed to
return to Rossville. She would there hear her lover's name
mentioned-she would be amidst the scenes with which his
image was associated-and there would be enjoyment even in
these shadowy fantastic pleasures. While such were the
feelings of the mother and daughter, Lord Rossville felt no
less impatient for the return of his niece—not for the charms
and graces of her society, but because she was a being sub-
ject to his management and control. True, this act of rebel-
lion might have staggered his faith as to the extent of his
dominion; but he flattered himself that was a sort of thunder-
cloud, which, by the wise and vigorous measures he had
adopted, must already have passed away. Besides, Gertrude's
prolonged absence would have an appearance in the eyes of
the world — suspicions might arise--things might be said.
Even in the bustle of electioneering, Mr. Delmour had re-
marked upon the impropriety of Miss St. Clair being allowed
to reside so long in a paltry provincial town, and associating
with people who might be very good in their way, but were
not quite suited to her station, or such as he would wish his
wife to be intimate with. On the other hand, Mrs. St. Clair,
in the course of her correspondence with the Earl, had taken
care to insinuate, that such was Mr. Adam Ramsay's par-
tiality for her daughter, it was more than probable he would
make a point of her residing entirely with him, unless she
were speedily recalled to his Lordship’s protection. A
visit to Bloom - Park strengthened this insinuation, and
decided him as to the necessity of immediately recalling his
niece.
A most laborious and long-winded letter was therefore
penned to Miss St. Clair, in which, while he deprecated the
idea of ever taking her into his favour, until she had renounced
11

TIIE INHERITANCE.
the error of her ways, he, at the same time, announced his
intention of receiving her again under his roof, in the confi-
dent hope that she would ere long perceive the absolute
necessity and imperious duty she was under of acceding to
his long-projected, thoroughly-digested, and firmly-deter-
mined-upon plan for her ultimate disposal. His Lordship
next proceeded to state, that he had consulted the most
eminent counsel as to the deeds of entail, and that three of
them were of opinion, that the whole of the property could
and might be most effectively alienated, disponed, and other-
wise disposed of, to the utter exclusion of Miss St. Clair, as
heiress-at-law. Such being the case, it was his firm intention,
and absolute purpose, to act upon this opinion, by executing
a new deed of entail within three months from the present
date, unless, before the expiry of that period, Miss St. Clair
should think proper to accede to his plan, and pursue the
course he had pointed out to her. Such was the substance
of a letter filling nearly seven pages of closely-written
paper.
"I am sorry-very sorry," said Gertrude, with a sigh, as
she finished reading it, “ for the trouble and vexation I am
causing Lord Rossville ; and perhaps it were better that I
should never return to Rossville again, than that I should go
there only to make him cherish hopes which never can be
realised. I never can act as he would have me- I never can
change my sentiments."
You can at least keep your sentiments to yourself, con-
sidering how much is at stake on their account,” said her
mother with asperity ; _“and, indeed, setting everything else
out of the question, I think delicacy alone demands that
much of you ;-at least, I should be cautious how I expressed
an attachment, which, to all appearance, is no longer-if in-
deed it ever was-reciprocal.”.
“Even were it so," replied her daughter, making an effort
to repress her emotion, while her faltering voice betrayed
the anguish of such a supposition—"deceived I may be
myself, but I never will deceive others; let, then, Lord Ross-
ville know, that, if I return to his house, I return unchanged
-unchangeable."
“Beware how you provoke me, Gertrude, for I too, am
unchanged unchangeable in my determination, never to see
you the prey of that man.--I have pledged my word it shall
not be."
“Pledged your word !” repeated her daughter indignantly;
-"who had a right 'o demand such a pledge ?"
"One who has the right, and will exercise it,” said Mrs.
St. Clair, in some agitation ; " but this is wandering from

the point. You have promised you will not enter into any
engagement until you have attained the age of twenty-one-
on that promise I rely; meanwhile, all I require of you is
only what is due to yourself, leave me, therefore, to manage
matters with the Earl, and do you remain passive for the
present.”
"I am sick of management-of mystery," exclaimed Ger-
trude, dejectedly—" already," cried she, giving way to tears.
“ I am almost weary of the world—I feel myself a puppet-
a slave-nay, the slave of a slave-subject, it seems, to the
control of a very menial; but I will not endure this mockery
of greatness, mingled, too, with such degradation.”
There was a height and a depth in the feelings of Miss
St. Clair which, when once roused, her mother could not
always contend with. She sometimes felt, that her only
chance of victory was in appearing to yield; and upon this
occasion, as upon many others, she contrived to work upon
her daughter's affections, and prevailed upon her to acquiesce
in her wishes, provided she were not considered as a party in
Lord Rossville's plans.
The following day, the Earl's equipage and attendants
arrived; and again Mrs. St. Clair's worldly mind exulted as
she looked on the proud pageant at which the whole town of
Barnford had turned out to gaze. It was not without emotion
Gertrude bade adieu to her aunts, who were not less affected
at parting with her; they saw she was not happy, but were
too delicate to intrude upon her confidence.
“Farewell, my love,” said her aunt Mary, as she pressed
her in her arms—and ever bear in mind, that, in this
world, not to be grieved—not to be afflicted—not to be in
danger, is impossible :-yet, dearest Gertrudel even in this
world, there is a rest of heart-ah! would you but seek it
where only it to be found !"
But to the young unchastened spirit, nothing seems less
desirable than that rest of heart, which, in their minds, is
associated with the utter extinction of all that is noble, and
graceful, and enthusiastic, and Gertrude shrank from the wish
breathed for her by her aunt.
"No," thought she" wretched as I am, yet I would not
exchange my feelings, tortured as they are, for that joyless
peace, which is to me as the slumber of the dead !"
And where is the youthful ardent spirit, untaught of
Heavenly love, which has not, at some period of its life,
perilled its all on some baseless fabric, and preferred even the
shattered wreck of its happiness to the waveless calm of
indifference?
Gertrude's melancholy was not diminished by her return

to Rossville. But a few weeks had passed since she had left
it in all the pride and magnificence of early autumn-while
nature seemed scarcely past its prime-while life was in the
leat, and spirit in the air, and the bright-toned woods glowed
in all their variegated splendour, beneath a clear blue sky,
and cloudless sun.
But now it was a bleak, raw, chill November day, when
nature seems a universal blank even to her most ardent
admirers; and, to use an artist phrase, nothing could be more
in keeping with the day than the reception Miss St. Clair
met with from her uncle. It was cold, formal, and unkindly,
and every word fell like a drop of petrifying water on her
heart.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
SEVERAL (lays passed in this state of cheerless monotony,
when, one morning, as the ladies pursued their different avo-
cations in unsocial companionship, a letter was brought to
Mrs. St. Clair, which she had no sooner opened, than Ger-
trude observed her change colour, and betray visible signs of
agitation. The servant said the bearer waited an answer,
and, in manifest confusion, she rose and left the room. Al-
though superior to the meanness of curiosity, Miss St. Clair
could not help feeling a natural desire to know the contents
of a letter which had produced so visible a change on her
mother, and she sat a considerable time vainly looking for
her return. At length, unable to repress her anxiety, she
put aside her drawing materials, and hastened to her mother's
dressing-room. Upon entering, she found Mrs. St. Clair
seated at a table, with writing implements before her, and
her head resting on her hand, seemingly buried in profound
meditation.
“I was afraid something was the matter, mamma,” said her
daughter, gently advancing towards her.
“ Leave me I cried her mother, in an angry impatient
tone ; leave me, I say-I can't be disturbed.
“Mamma, can I do nothing for you ?” asked her daughter,
as she reluctantly prepared to obey.
“Much, much,"—murmured Mrs. St. Clair, with a deep
sigh—“but, at present, I desire you will leave me," raising
her voice in an authoritative tone ; and Gertrude, however
unwillingly, found herself compelled to obey. Uneasy and
restless, she could not compose her mind to any of her ordi-
nary occupations. She saw something had occurred to agitate

165
her mother, and she longed to participate, and, if possible, to
aid her in her distress. After a while, she again returned to
her, and was again repulsed with anger. Seeing that her
presence only caused irritation, she desisted from further
attempts; and, taking advantage of a watery gleam of sun-
shine, which streamed from a pale sickly sky, she set out on
a solitary ramble, to which fresh air and exercise only could
give a zest. She slowly pursued her way through leafless
woods, where the only sounds she heard were those of her
own footsteps amongst the fallen leaves, and the monotonous
rush of the swollen stream. But each step was fraught with
sad, yet soothing recollections--for rocks, woods, and waters,
seemed all as the registers of her lover's vows; and in each
silent memorial she felt as though she looked on the living
witness of his faith. Thus nursing her fond contemplations,
she had wandered a considerable length of way, when she
was roused to observation by the sudden darkness of the sky
-but whether caused by the lateness of the hour, or the ap-
proach of a storm, she was not sufficiently mistress of signs
and times to ascertain. Whichever it might be, it had the
effect of dispelling all romance, and making her wish herself
once more safe at home. She was, however, more than two
miles from it, by the way she had come ; but, if she could
get across the river, there was a short cut, which would take
her home in ten minutes, and she walked a little farther on
in search of some stepping-stones, which had been placed
there instead of a bridge, which had been swept away by
what, in the language of the country, is called a speat.
A great deal of rain had fallen the preceding night, and
the river was so much swollen, she could scarcely recognise
the huge blocks by which she had frequently crossed the
clear pebbly stream when it scarcely laved their sides. Now
they merely held their broad heads above the brown sullen
waters—but still they were above it-and, trusting to her
own steady head and firm step, she, with some little palpita-
tion, placed her foot on the first stone, "Ce n'est que le pre-
mier pas qui coûte," said she to herself; but, notwithstand-
ing this comfortable assurance, there she stood for some
minutes ere she had courage to venture on a second step.
But the sky was getting blacker, and some large straggling
drops of rain began to fall. Ashamed of her irresolution,
she was about to proceed, when she heard some one calling
loudly to her to stop, and immediately she beheld Mr. Lynd-
say approaching at full speed on horseback. In an instant
he urged his horse into the river, but the current was so
strong, it was with the utmost difficulty the animal was en-
abled to gain the opposite side.

once.
“Is it possible," cried Lyndsay, as he threw himself off,
“ that you were going to attempt to cross the river in its pre-
sent state ?"
“I not only mean to attempt, but to succeed," answered
she, as she felt her courage rise to its utmost pitch, since she
had now an opportunity of displaying it, and she was about
to proceed, when he seized her hand-
“You are not aware of the danger :-the river, you may
see, is far above its usual height, and is rising every moment.
A great deal of rain has fallen, and a fresh flood will be down
directly."
“Well, it seems merely a choice of evils, as I seem des-
tined to be drowned one way or another,” said Gertrude, as
the rain now began to fall in earnest.
“I assure you, then, you will find it much the least evil
to be drowned on dry land—so, pray, take my advice for
But Gertrude felt as though it were due to Colonel Del-
mour to accord nothing to Mr. Lyndsay, against whom she
laboured to keep up what she deemed a due resentment, and
she, therefore, persisted in her intention.
“I am far from desiring Mr. Lyndsay's attendance," said
she somewhat disdainfully. “I beg he will take his way,
and
allow me to take mine."
Lyndsay made no reply but by hastily snatching her from
the place where she stood—and, at the same instant, a sound
as of many waters was heard—a sea of foam was tearing
its course along--and, in the twinkling of an eye, the stones
were buried in the waves. For some moments Gertrude re-
mained motionless, gazing on the mass of discoloured waters
as they roared along, till she was roused by the cry and the
struggle of some living thing, which was swept past with the
speed of lightning, and ingulfed in the raging flood. She
turned shuddering away; and Lyndsay, taking her arm in
his, would have led her from the spot-but, smote with the
sense of her own injustice towards him, she exclaimed,
“Not till I have here acknowledged my rashness—my folly;
you risked your life to save mine, while I-unjust-ungrate-
ful, that I was—-
“Not to me, my dear cousin, is any such acknowledgment
due,” said Mr. Lyndsay, mildly ;—"give your thanks to God
-only let us be friends."
Gertrude gave him her hand.-“When can I cease to look
upon you as my friend ?—you who have saved me from de-
struction !”
Lyndsay sighed, but made no reply, and they walked on in
silence, till the rain, which had hitherto fallen at intervals,

in an undecided manner, now burst forth, in what in Scotland
is emphatically called an even-down pour. Neither rocks
nor trees afforded any shelter, but they were now in sight of
a summer-house, and thither they hastened. While Lynd-
say stopped on the outside to fasten his horse, intending to
leave him until he could send his servant to fetch him home,
Gertrude rushed in, and, almost blinded by the rain, did not,
at first, perceive that some one had already taken possession
of it, and was pacing up and down with visible signs of im-
patience. But, at her entrance, the person turned quickly
round, and she encountered the sharp baleful glance of Lew-
iston.
“Ha! this is more than I expected," cried he, in an accent
of pleasure and surprise ; then, taking her passive hand,
6. This is well—this is as it should be-come, my pretty mes-
senger, sit down, don't be afraid.”
But this caution, though uttered in a soft conciliating
manner, was in vain. At first, amazement had rendered
Gertrude mute and motionless; but as he attempted to seat
her, and place himself beside her, she instantly regained her
faculties, and struggling to release herself from his hold, she
called loudly,-
“Mr. Lyndsay, save me! oh! save me!"
But Mr. Lyndsay had withdrawn a few yards, to place his
horse under the shelter of a projecting rock, and the roar of
the river drowned all other sounds.
“Fool” exclaimed Lewiston, as he held both her hands,
and squeezed them with almost painful violence; “ be still,
I tell you—be still, and you have nothing to fear; but if you
provoke me—by Heaven! you will rue the day you first saw
the light!" and he compelled her to be seated.
Gertrude would have spoken, but the words died on her
lips, and she sat pale and trembling, unable to articulate.
“Why, this is foolish,” cried he, but in a gentler tone-
“ very foolish. Have I not told you, that you have nothing
to fear—that I love you too well ? -The deuce 1cannot
you be quiet ?"-As Gertrude again called wildly on Mr.
Lyndsay—“Why, did you come here only to squall, you
simpleton ?-Why did she not come herself, and where is the
money?-answer me, I say :- A squire, by Jupiter!" ex-
claimed he fiercely, as Lyndsay now entered—“Well, sir,
what is your business here?”
Mr. Lyndsay started with surprise, as he beheld Miss St.
Clair seated by the side of this man, whom he instantly re-
cognised as the same from whom he had formerly rescued
but her extreme paleness, and the terror depicted on
her countenance, showed what her endurance cost her. The

have any
insolent question was repeated in a still higher key. Even
Lyndsay's usual calmness was almost overcome, but he re-
pelled the rising of his wrath, and answered,-
· My business here is to protect this lady from insult or
intrusion,"-and advancing to her, he placed himself by her
side.
“O let us begone!" cried Gertrude, as she rose and took
hold of his arm; but she trembled so much she could
scarcely stand.
“ You cannot go yet,” said Lyndsay; then turning to
Lewiston—"but as your presence seems to agitate Miss St.
Clair, I must request of you to withdraw."
“By what right, sir, do you interfere between this lady
and me?" demanded he fiercely.
“I know of no right you have to ask me such a question,”
said Mr. Lyndsay coolly.,
“You know of no right I have l-and pray what do you
know of me or my rights ?”
Lyndsay's blood rose at this continued insolence; but,
making an effort to master his spirit, he replied,-
“You say true, I know nothing of you; but I know you
can have no right to alarm Miss St. Clair—if you
claim upon her notice, this is neither a place nor a time for
it."
“Her notice !” repeated Lewiston, with a scornful smile-
6. Well, be it so! I have claims upon her notice then, and
you will do well to leave us to settle our own affairs."
“Oh, no, no!" cried Gertrude, as she clung to her
cousin's arm" do not leave me.—I have nothing to say."-
But as she thought of her mother's mysterious connection
with him, she trembled while she disclaimed him.
“ Do not be afraid," said Lyndsay, trying to reassure her
" there is nothing to fear, except insolence; and that I
shall spare you, if this gentleman will walk out with me for
a few minutes.'
“I have already told you, that I have no business with
you, sir,” said Lewiston—"and the insolence is yours, who
thus break in upon my appointments.—Come, my dear,” to
Gertrude, “rid yourself of your spark quietly, for I don't
wish to harm the young man-tell him the truth, and bid
him begone."
Never in his life had Mr. Lyndsay's self-control been so
severely tried, but he still had firmness to keep himself in
check.
"I know of no appointment,” said Gertrude faintly, as she
thought of the letter her mother had that morning received,
"accident alone brought me bere.”

me."
Lewiston looked steadfastly at her.
“ You are sure that is the case? Take care how you at-
tempt to deceive me-your hand upon it.”
Gertrude involuntarily recoiled.
6 How dare you thus presume?" cried Lyndsay pas-
sionately; but in an agony of terror, she hastily held out her
hand. Lewiston seized it, and holding it up with an air of
insolent triumph,
" Tis well you obeyed memelse, by all the saints, in
another second I should have had you on your knees before
" Audacious villain !” exclaimed Mr. Lyndsay, provoked
beyond further forbearance, seizing him by the collar, and
shaking him with a force that made him stagger. “This lady's
presence alone prevents me from punishing you as you de-
serve."
Gertrude shrieked, as Lewiston instantly drew a small
dagger-sword from his walking cane.
“Do you see that?”, cried he, with a scornful laugh.
" How easily I could pink one of those fine eyes of yours, or
open a vein for you, and let out a little of your hot blood;
but I don't think the worse of you for this exploit, and only
give you this little piece of advice, before you talk of punish-
ing, to be sure you have the means in your own hands."
"I thank you,” said Lyndsay, as he led Gertrude to the
door, then turning back, he added, in a low voice, “and I
shall return to repeat my acknowledgments-only wait me
here."
The rain had not ceased, but its violence had abated, and
they walked on for some time in silence, till they both at the
same moment descried Mrs. St. Clair approaching, muffled in
a large cloak—but she, too, seemed to have perceived them,
for she instantly turned back, and in another moment disap-
peared by one of the many paths which traversed the
wood.
“Oh!” exclaimed Gertrude, with a burst of bitter feeling
at this confirmation of her mother's clandestine intercourse.
“Oh! that the flood from which you saved me had swept
me away, rather than that I should live to endure this degra-
dation |
"My dear cousin," said Mr. Lyndsay, gently, “do not
give way to such dreadful thoughts—were you steeped in
crime, you could not do more than despair-even then you
ought not to do that."
* Crime there must be somewhere,” cried Gertrude, in the
same tone of excitement; "else why all this mystery—and
why am I subjected to the insults of that
man,
unless

"Do
you know who and what he really is ?” said Mr.
Lyndsay.
“O, ask me no questions !” cried she again, giving way to
tears.
" Pardon me, I have done wrong-it is not from you I
ought to seek information."
Seek it not at all-leave me to my fate—abject and
degraded I already am in your eyes.”
“How little you know me, if you think that circumstances
over which you evidently have no control, could ever lessen
you in my eyes! It is not the misdeeds of others that can
touch your soul, and they ought not to influence your cha-
racter. There is not—there cannot be degradation but in
personal sin."
“Yet I owe it entirely to your generous confidence, that I
am not suspected-despised -"
“Suspicion itself scarcely could suspect you; and for
despising you-do not think so falsely, 80 meanly of your-
self, as to imagine that any one would dare to despise you.
I fear something is wrong, and that you are not in good
hands; but put your trust in God, my dear cousin-preserve
your own natural integrity, and all will one day be right;
meantime, if I can be of service to you, look upon me as a
friend-as a brother-will you promise me this ?'”.
Gertrude, in somewhat calmer accents, promised she would.
Lyndsay continued to talk to her in the same soothing yet
strengthening strain till they reached the castle, when they
separated with sentiments of reciprocal interest and regard.

CHAPTER XXXV.
No sooner had Mr. Lyndsay seen Miss St. Clair safe within
the castle walls than he instantly retraced his steps with the
intention of returning to the summer-house, for the purpose
of extricating her, if possible, from the mysterious thraldom
in which she seemed to be held by this person. At the
midnight rencontre in the wood, he had asserted a right over
her, which, although she herself had disclaimed with almost
frantic wiláness, her mother had tacitly acknowledged by not
directly denying. In the short conversation he had held
with Mrs. St. Clair, subsequent to that meeting, she had
with tears implored his silence his secrecy — his for-
bearance-and in broken and indirect terms, had given him
to understand that this person had been engaged with her

husband in certain money transactions, which, out of regard
to his memory, she was desirous of keeping concealed ; and
it was upon this ground he had asserted a claim upon Miss
St. Clair's fortune, which he had unwarrantably extended to
her hand. This mangled and absurd account could not im-
pose upon Lyndsay, but at that time, he was almost a
stranger to Mrs. St. Clair, and did not conceive himself au-
thorised to interfere in her concerns. He, therefore, con-
tented himself with mildly admonishing her on the impro-
priety of such clandestine meetings, and recommending to
her to lay this person's claims before Lord Rossville, as the
proper protector of his brother's memory, and his niece's
interest. In the meantime, he yielded to Mrs. St. Clair's
entreaties, and gave her his promise not to divulge what had
passed, upon her solemn assurance that the affair was in the
way of being amicably adjusted, and that she had taken effec-
tual means of ridding herself for ever of this person's importu-
nity. This promise, it now appeared, had not been kept ; again
Miss St. Clair had been exposed to fresh insult in his pre-
sence, and he now thought himself entitled to interpose.
With this purpose he walked quickly back, and had almost
reached the summer-house, when he was met by Mrs. St.
Clair ; her countenance was agitated, and traces of tears
were visible in her eyes. She did not, however, now seem
to shun him, for she stopped and extended her hand to him,
saying—"
-“You are the very person I most wish to see,-give
me your arm, and let us return together, I have much to
say to you."
“But there is a person there to whom I also have much to
say; and I cannot ha the honour 'attending you, till I have
first spoken with him." And he was passing on, when Mrs.
St. Clair caught his arm,
“I know whom you seek; but spare yourself the trouble
he is gone."
66 Where ?—which
way
y?" eagerly demanded he; “but I
must ascertain that myself," and he ran with all his speed to
the summer-house ; but it was deserted; and, though he
looked long and keenly in all directions, not a trace of any
one was to be seen. He was therefore obliged to retrace his
steps, and soon overtook Mrs. St. Clair.
" You would not give credit to me, then ?" said she, in a
tone of reproach.
“ I shall give credit to you now," answered he,“ if you
will tell me where I am likely to find the person I left here
half an hour ago."
“I cannot tell—and, if I could, perhaps I would not. No
good could possibly result from your meeting-your wish, I

upon him.
know, is to befriend my daughter and myself; and, be as-
sured, I am far from insensible of the value of such a friend.
But, come with me, I have much to say to you, much to
confide to you of my dearest Gertrude."
Mrs. St. Clair's hyperbolical jargon was always offensive to
Mr. Lyndsay's good taste and right feeling ; but there was
something absolutely revolting in it at this time-there was
something so strained and unnatural in it—such a flimsy
attempt at thus seeming to court explanation, that he felt
armed against the duplicity he was aware would be practised
" At another time I shall be ready to listen to anything
which concerns Miss St. Clair,” said he, coldly; “but, at pre-
sent, I wish to put a few questions to the person-
“Pardon me; but I know all you would say, my dear Mr.
Lyndsay; and you must allow me to anticipate those ques-
tions by the confidential communication I am now about to
make to you. On your honour-on your secrecy I know I
may place the most unbounded reliance-I therefore require
no assurances to satisfy me."
“I certainly can give none until I know how far secrecy
may be compatible with honour."
Mrs. St. Člair affected not to hear this implied doubt, but
went on-
"You have now had opportunities of becoming acquainted
with my daughter-of forming your own opinion of her cha-
racter-of-pardon a mother's vanity—of appreciating her
charms and her graces ;-but you know not-none but a
mother can know, the treasures of her heart and mind."
Mrs. St. Clair paused and sighed, and Mr. Lyndsay was
too much surprised at such an opening to make any reply.
“Judge, then, at my grief and anguish at finding this
gifted being, this idol of my affections, ensnared by the arti-
fices of one every way unworthy of her, has been led to
bestow her regards"
“Pardon me," cried Lyndsay; "but I can have no possible
right to be made the depositary of Miss St. Clair's sentiments
by any but herself. I must be excused from listening to any-
thing more on that subject-I simply wish to know where I
am likely to find the person who has, twice in my presence,
dared to insult her."
“Yet it is only by hearing me patiently, and suffering me
to take my own way in divulging the circumstances of the
case, as I think best, that I can possibly make you ac-
quainted with them; either my lips must be sealed as to the
whole, or you must listen to the whole without interruption.
-I am mistaken if I tell you anything new, when I allude to

173
my daughter's misplaced partiality, still more mistaken, if
her future happiness is a matter of indifference to you.
Lyndsay made no answer; he felt that Mrs. St. Clair was
weaving a web around him, but he could not bring himself to
burst from its folds, and he suffered her to proceed.
“I will not attempt to paint to you the anguish of my heart
at discovering, that the innocent affections of my unsus-
pecting child had been thus artfully and insidiously worked
upon by Colonel Delmour.
I know him, and you know
him to be a selfish, mercenary, unprincipled man, as inca-
pable of appreciating such a being as Gertrude, as she
would have been of bestowing her affections on a character
such as his, had not her imagination been dazzled and misled.
But, alas ! at seventeen, where is our judgment and discrimi-
nation? Yet at seven-and-twenty they will come too late
then, long before then, if she becomes the wife of Colonel
Delmour, she will be the most wretched of women. Formed
to find her happiness solely in the being she loves-noble,
generous, upright, sincere herself, what will be her feelings
when the mask drops, as drop it will, from this idol of her
fancy, and she beholds him in his native deformity.-N0,-
sooner than see her the wife of Colonel Delmour, I take
Heaven to witness, I would rather look upon her in her coffin."
Inflated as all this was, still there was much of truth and
right feeling in it, and he insensibly forgot his suspicions, and
listed with profound attention.
“ Yet I dare not express to Lord Rossville all that I feel,
for neither can I accede to his views for the disposal of my
daughter. Gertrude has too much taste and feeling-too
much heart and soul - to be sacrificed to family pride and
political influence; in fact, as far as regards her happiness,
there is but a choice of evils in these brothers—but there is
_” she stopped and hesitated; "there is one to whom
I would, with pride and pleasure, have confided my dearest
treasure, in the certainty that, as ber judgment matured, so
her love and esteem would increase towards that one.-Why
should I conceal from you my wish ?”
Mrs. St. Clair made a full stop, and looked at Mr. Lyndsay
in a manner he could not misunderstand.
This was something he had not anticipated—it went far
beyond what he had calculated upon, and he was thrown off
his guard. His features betrayed his emotion, although he
remained silent. There was a long pause. At length Mrs.
St. Clair resumed
"The time will come when the veil will fall from my
daughter's eyes. As her judgment ripens her imagination will
one-

decline. Already I can perceive the work is begun, and time
is all that is wanting to finish it; but if, as may happen, she
is hurried into a clandestine engagement, my hopes—her
happiness—will be for ever blasted! On the other hand, if
by any sacrifice, any stratagem, I can save her, can you
blame me for the attempt, however wild or desperate it may
appear ?"
"I certainly could not blame a sacrifice, however vain
it might prove," said Lyndsay ; “but I must always disap-
prove of stratagems, even when successful; both together
seem to me incompatible.”
For a moment Mrs. St. Clair was thrown into confusion by
this remark, but, quickly rallying, she replied,-
“Yet the one may prove the consequence of the other-in
my case I fear it has--and that, in using what I conceived an
allowable stratagem to save my daughter, I have sacrified
what I value next-the good opinion and esteem of Mr.
Lyndsay."
"It rests with yourself to remove any unfavourable im-
pression I may have receiveda few words will suffice."
"I feel that you will blame me, that you will condemn
the step I have taken," said Mrs. St. Clair, in evident
embarrassment; "it must appear to you strange, unworthy,
unnatural; but you know not the difficulties of my situation.
Gertrude rash and ungovernable-Lord Rossville inflexible
and exacting. If she marries Colonel Delmour, her fortune
and her happiness are both alike blasted. To save her from
that—at least to gain time-can you altogether condemn me
if I have taken advantage of this person's unwarranted
claim upon her fortune, to induce a belief in her mind that
that claim does in reality extend to her hand, and that-
But, oh Heavens !" exclaimed she, as they suddenly came in
sight of the Castle, “it must be very late-lights in the
drawing-room, and company assembled. If I am missed
To-morrow we shall resume this subject; meantime I must
fly;" and she would have withdrawn her arm from Mr.
Lyndsay's, but he detained her.
“ No," said he; "before we part, promise me solemnly,
that you will lay open to ine the whole of this dark trans-
action; strange thoughts have taken possession of my mind.
I will no longer connive at this mystery.”
It was too dark to see the working of Mrs. St. Clair's
features; but he felt the hand he held tremble in his
grasp.
" To-morrow, then-to-morrow, dear Mr. Lyndsay, I pro-
mise to satisfy you more fully," said she, in a voice faint from

agitation. “Till then be silent, I conjure you—for Gere
trude's sake be silent. Oh, do not detain me! there is the
warning bell."
And she darted forwards, and ran till she reached the door,
then turning round, she pressed Lyndsay's hand, and in
breathless accents whispered, “For Gertrude's sake, then,
you will be silent till to-morrow-you promise me this ? "
“ Till to-morrow, then, be it," said he.
Mrs. St. Clair again pressed his hand in token of gratitude,
then entered softly, and stole up stairs to change her dress,
while Mr. Lyndsay, as he walked openly and deliberately to
his apartment, thought—"She has got the better of me, I fear,
after all, but to-morrow will show."
CHAPTER XXXVI.
ALTHOUGH Mr. Lyndsay had made all dispatch in dressing,
yet, upon entering the drawing-room, he found Mrs. St.
Clair had got the start of him.
No appearance of hurry or agitation was now visible,
unless in her more than usually brilliant colour. Her dress
was handsome, and well arranged; her air, to common
observers, easy and unembarrassed ; and altogether, she
formed a striking contrast to her daughter, who sat by her,
pale, thoughtful, and dejected, with the look of one who had
almost unconsciously suffered herself to be dressed.
As Mr. Lyndsay entered, he heard Mrs. St. Clair say to
Lord Rossville, in answer to some remark of his,
“I was, indeed, caught to-day. I foolishly took the alarm
at Gertrude's absence during that prodigious shower, and set
out in search of her myself; but we missed each other, and
have now only met by the side of your Lordship's charming
fire."
Lord Rossville loved to be complimented upon his fires,
which were always constructed after a model of his own, and
were, of course, notoriously bad: but Mrs. St. Clair knew
how to throw out a tub to catch a whale-her well-timed
compliment led to a discussion upon fires, stoves, and coals,
which ended in the whole company being speedily involved
in the intricacies of one of the Earl's own coal-pits, from
which they were only rescued by a summons to dinner.
Mr. Delmour had returned, bringing a band of his second-
rate political allies along with him, and the conversation con-
sequently took its cast from them, and was as dull as political

176
THE INHERITANCE.
discussions always are, unless when, worse than dull, violent.
Mrs. St. Clair entered into all that was said 'con amore,' and
was consequently thought, by the greater part of the com-
pany, to be an uncommonly clever, charming, well-informed,
lady-like woman. Lady Betty asked some questions as effi-
cient as usual, and passed for a very worthy, sensible, affable,
old lady. Miss St. Clair sat silent, and absent, and indifferent
to what was going on, and was pronounced a cold, haughty,
inanimate, fine lady. Such are the judgments daily
passed upon as slight a knowledge of that within which
passeth show-and so superficial a thing is popularity.
On quitting the dining-room, Mrs. St. Clair whispered
her daughter to follow her to her own apartment, and no
sooner were they there, than, shutting the door with violence,
she seemed as if eager to indemnify herself for the constraint
she had been under.
“ Gertrude !" cried she, all at once giving way to her
agitation ;-" again you see me in your hands-again my fate
hangs on your decision-again it is yours to save or to
destroy me.
Gertrude could not speak-her heart sickened at the evil
she anticipated.
“But I will not go over the same ground I have done. I
I am at your mercy, but I will neither supplicate nor
command. I leave you free-pronounce my doom, and do
not fear even my reproaches."
Gertrude's senses almost forsook her, as the dreadful idea
flashed upon her, that she was to be required to save her
mother's life, at the expense of becoming the wife of the
dreaded Lewiston, and sinking at her feet, in wild broken
accents, she besought her to spare her.
“Compose yourself, Gertrude,” cried Mrs. St. Clair, sud-
denly calming herself at sight of her daughter's still stronger
emotion,—" I tell you, you have nothing to fear from me. I
have promised that I will not even seek to influence you; all
I require of you is to hear the alternative."
“Oh, no, no—spare me that dreadful alternative. Kill me,
but save me from him !" and she clung to her mother's knees
with convulsive energy.
“Gertrude, this is madness; it rests with yourself to rid
me of that man, I trust for ever. Come, sit down by me,
and listen;" and she seated herself at a writing-table, and
placed her daughter beside her. After a pause, during which
she seemed to be struggling with her feelings, she spoke,
Gertrude, I cannot conceal from you that we are both in
the power of a villain. I have told you, and I again repeat
it, the circumstances which have placed me there I will only
tell you

disclose with my dying breath, if even then; how soon that
may be depends upon your decision. I can no longer conceal
from you that he does possess a claim over you-nay, be still,
and hear me—which he is ready to relinquish, if, within
twenty-four hours, I can raise five hundred pounds. This I
must accomplish, or my ruin-your wretchedness for life-
is inevitable.”
Gertrude began to breathe at this unexpected relief.
“ If he obtains this sum, he has pledged himself to quit
the kingdom, and with worlds, if I had them, would I pur-
chase his absence.'
“But what are those mysterious claims which this man has
upon me? why not bring them forward openly ?_let them
be urged in the face of the world: in this land of freedom
in my uncle's house-what have I to fear?”
"As you value your father's memory, as you value my
peace, my life, let this transaction be for ever buried in
silence: if there were a way to escape-if it were possible to
release ourselves from him, can you suppose that I would
have suffered what I have done that I would have sub-
mitted thus to humble myself to my own child ?"
And Mrs. St. Clair dropped a few tears.
“ But where is such a sum to be had ?" asked her daughter,
as she thought how she had already been stripped of every-
thing she could call her own. • I have nothing in my
"I know you have nothing to give; but you have only to
ask and you will obtain. My uncle can refuse you nothing;
and it is no such mighty matter in the future Countess of
Rossville to borrow a few hundred pounds from a man to
whom wealth is an absolute drug. Here,” said she, placing
some paper before her, and putting a pen into her hand, “ you
have only to write, and I will dictate.
But the pen dropped from Gertrude's fingers.
• No, I cannot ; indeed I cannot be guilty of such mean-
ness—it is too degrading."
Mrs. St. Clair made no attempt to argue or remonstrate ;
but, waving her hand with a sort of desperate calmness, she
merely said, -
“I am answered-leave me."
6. Oh! mamma, give me the paper-you shall be obeyed-
tell me what I must say.".
Mrs. St. Clair testified neither joy nor gratitude at this
concession; but immediately began to dictate the form of a
letter to Mr. Adam Ramsay, which her daughter implicitly
followed, scarcely conscious of what she wrote. In a calmer
mood, she would have revolted from the duplicity and ser-
power !"

vility with which every line was fraught; but, in her present
excitement of mind, her powers of thinking were suspended,
and she was the mere passive instrument of her mother's will.
At length it was finished ; and, as Mrs. St. Clair sealed it, she
looked
at her watch-
“It will be just in time for the letter-box and no more; we
must return to the drawing-room, and we can put it into the
box as we pass through the hall."
“I cannot return to the company,” said her daughter. “I
am unfit for society after such a scene as this I cannot dis-
semble."
“You can, at least, it is to be hoped, exercise some self-
control, and not suffer yourself to be read and commented
upon by every curious eye which chooses to look in your face.
Happily 'tis one that even crying cannot spoil; you have only
to wipe away your tears," and she applied her own handker-
chief; “and, see, not a trace of them remains—Come, I in-
sist upon it.” And Gertrude suffered herself to be led to the
drawing-room.
The only person with whom she now felt any companion-
ship was Mr. Lyndsay. There was a sort of protection in his
presence which made her like to be near him: some unknown
evil hung over her, from which it seemed as if he only could
deliver her; and when he entered the room and approached
her, she welcomed him with the only look of gladness that
had brightened her face that day.
The following day Mrs. St. Clair was confined to her bed with
a severe cold and rheumatism, the consequences of her walk
the preceding day. All was anxious expectation, on her part
and Gertrude's, for the answer from Mr. Ramsay; but the
post arrived, and brought no letter. This disappointment was
only a passing knell, as the thought suggested itself that
uncle Adam might not think it proper to trust a bill for five
hundred pounds to the post, and would most probably send it
by a special messenger:
By her mother's desire, Gertrude therefore stationed her-
self at the window, to watch the arrival of any one likely to
be the bearer of the important dispatch. Not sister Anne
herself looked with more wistful eyes, or was oftener called
upon to declare what she saw; and when, at length, she
descried the identical old red hack-chaise, belonging to the
White Bear, rocking up the avenue, not Blue Beard himself,
sword in hand, could have caused greater consternation. This
was an evil Mrs. St. Clair had never contemplated-a per-
sonal inquiry set on foot by the awful uncle Adam, was an
idea too dreadful to have entered into her imagination; and
when it was announced that Mr, Ramsay wished to see Miss

summons.
St. Clair alone, her agitation was almost too much for her.
Although trembling herself, Gertrude yet tried to soothe her
mother into calmness; and having again and again assured
her that she would not betray her, that she would take the
whole responsibility upon herself, she left her to obey the
But her heart failed her when she reached the
door of the apartment where he was, and she stood some
minutes with her hand on the lock ere she had courage to
turn it. At length she entered, but dared not lift her eyes to
the cold sour visage, whose influence she felt even without
seeing. She tried to say something of trouble and kindness ;
but, in the agitation of her mind, she could not put a sentence
together—she could only invite him to sit down, and that she
did with trepidation. But, instead of complying, Mr. Ramsay
drew from his pocket an old black leather pocket-book, from
which he took Gertrude's letter, and, showing her the super-
scription, asked
“Is that your writing ?"
“ It is," answered Gertrude, in a voice scarcely articulate.
66 And wi' your
ain free will and knowledge ?"
She could not reply; but, in silent confusion, bent her
head.
“ And you're in want o' five hundred pound ?"
Gertrude's colour rose to the deepest carnation, while she
faintly answered-
"I am."
Mr. Ramsay gave something betwixt a hem and a groan, as
he drew a paper from the very inmost pocket of his venerable
repository, and held it out to her, then suddenly drawing
back, and looking sternly upon her, he asked
“You're no gawn to flee the country ?—speak the truth."
Gertrude felt her very temples glow at this ignominious
question, and, without speaking, there was something in her
look and gesture which dispelled the old man's hasty sus-
picion.
" There's the money then," said he in a cold bitter tone.
Gertrude involuntarily shrank from the ungracious-looking
hand that was scarcely extended to her.
“ Tak’ it,” cried he in a still more angry voice—“Tak’ it,
but you maun tak’ this alang wi't; I would rather hae parted
wi' five thousand, aye, five times five thousand, than that
such a letter should hae come frae you ;" and, tearing it in
pieces, he threw it into the fire.
“Oh! do not say so," cried Gertrude in great emotion, and
catching his hand, as he was about to leave the room.
"I maun say what I think ; I'm no ane o' the folk that
can say ae thing and think anither; I'm disappointed in you."

me
“ Yet if you knew-if the circumstances-
Mr. Ramsay shook his head.
Aye, aye, circumstances—that's aye the cry; but they
maun be ill circumstances that need aw this concealment,
even frae your ain mother."
“The time may perhaps come,” cried Miss St. Clair in in-
creasing agitation, " when I shall be able to convince you
that I am not to blame; in the meantime, if you will trust
“ Dinna think it's the money I care for," interrupted Mr.
Ramsay; “I value that five hundred pound nae mair than if
it were five hundred chucky stanes; but I'll tell you what I
valued, I valued you, and I valued your truth, and your
openness, and your downrightness, and I'm disappointed in
you."
“Oh! do not judge so hardly of me," cried Gertrude ;
“the time will come when you will think better of me."
6. The time o' a man o' threescore and ten will no be very
lang in this world; we'll maybe meet nae mair ; but, before
we part, there's ae thing I maun tell you-trust me, ye'll
ne'er huy true friends, nor true love, nor true happiness o'
ony kind wi' money; so beg, and borrow, and spend as you
will, but mind my words."
"Do not, oh! do not leave me in displeasure," cried Ger-
trude, bursting into tears, as he was again moving away.
“I feel nae displeeshure against you; I am only vexed,
and mortified, and disappointed; I had ta'en a liking to you.
It was gold that parted me frae her that was all the world to
me, and it was a pleeshure to me to like you for being like
her ; but gold, gold, gold, has parted us next."
Gertrude had been prepared to stand the burst of uncle
Adam's anger; but there was something in his querulous sor-
row that went to her heart. There is, indeed, a feeling inex-
pressibly painful in adding to the afflictions of the aged, and
heaping fresh sorrows upon the hoary head; many a bitter
drop must they, even the most prosperous, have drank in the
course of their long and weary pilgrimage, and woe be to the
hand which would willingly pour fresh gall into the very
dregs of their cup!
Some thought such as this filled Gertrude's heart, even to
overflowing.
“My dear kind uncle !" cried she, as she again seized his
hand, and even pressed it to her lips with reverence, while
her tears dropped upon it; “Oh! that you could read my
heart!"
Mr. Ramsay, like all caustic people, thought it necessary
to be more severe, as he felt himself getting soft,

" It might soon be better worth reading than your letter-
but there need be nae mair said about it-let byganes be by-
ganes."
“But can you—will you forgive me ?”
" I hae naething to forgi'e-I tell you I value the money
nae mair than the dirt beneath my feet—but I'm vexed—I'm
mortified that you should hae brought yoursel' to such
straits already."
“At least, in mercy, suspend your judgment."
Mr. Ramsay made no reply-his heart yearned to the image
of his beloved Lizzie, and he was on the point, not of take
ing her to his breast, for that was a weakness he would have
blushed at even in thought, but of holding out his cold blu-
jointless hand, and of according his forgiveness. He, how-
ever, checked himself as he thought of the magnitude of the
offence, and the encouragement it would be giving to that,
in his estimation, the most heinous of all offences-extrava-
gance. With a sort of repressed “Weel-weel!" and a
small wave of his hand, he, therefore, moved on without be-
traying his emotion, and seated himself in his old chaise,
satisfied that he had done his duty in discountenancing vice
by being as disagreeable as possible.
CHAPTER XXXVII.
But Mrs. St. Clair was in no mood to sympathise in the
nature of her daughter's distress, as her own joy at receiving
the money seemed to absorb every other consideration.
“There is still something for you to do, Gertrude, love,”
said she ; “I had promised to have some conversation with
Mr. Lyndsay to-day ; but you see my situation, and how un-
fit I am for such an exertion. You will therefore represent it
to him, and, at the same time, convey to him my determina-
tion to meet him to-morrow, coûte qui coûte ;" then, read-
ing surprise in her daughter's countenance, she added, in a
solemn tone, “ Gertrude, whatever has appeared strange and
mysterious in my conduct towards you, I am now going to
confide to him—will that satisfy you?”
“Is it possible !" exclaimed Miss St. Clair, in an accent of
astonishment and pleasure ; “then, I am sure, all will be
right.”
" Mr. Lyndsay appears to have made very rapid strides in
your good graces,” said her mother, with a look of displeasure,
« Yesterday you seemed to me to be scarcely upon speaking

terms. Well, although I am no great admirer, scarcely a
believer in Platonics in general, yet there may be exceptions
- you may therefore indulge in a sentimental religious flirta-
tion if you will, though I must always think a daughter's
best friend must be her mother ; at any rate, she will be
cautious how she talks of her mother, and suffers others to
do it-you have simply to deliv my message, and beware
of all comments. Now give me my writing materials, light
that taper, and leave me.'
Accustomed as she was to her mother's crooked policy even
in the merest trifles, Gertrude's mind misgave her that some-
thing very false lay at the bottom of this pretended confi-
dence; and she could not repress the painful suspicion, that
it was all a scheme to dupe him and deceive her. She,
however, sought her cousin for the purpose of delivering her
message: but it was not without embarrassment she repeated
it; and she thought she read doubt and distrust in the man-
ner in which he received it. Without expressing their mu-
tual thoughts, both felt that sort of intuitive knowledge of
what was passing in each other's mind, which needed not the
aid of words to impart. Nothing could be said indeed, to
serve any purpose, beyond that of mere speculation and con-
jecture, and although to many a mind there is nothing more
delightful than that sort of guess-gossip, yet Mr. Lyndsay's
rose superior to any such petty enjoyment, and he rather
sought to divert Gertrude's from dwelling on so disagreeable
a subject.
To-morrow came as to-morrow hitherto has done, but, as
is equally common, to-morrow fulfilled not the hope of yes-
terday. Mrs. St. Clair's malady had assumed a more serious
aspect. A physician was called in, who pronounced her dis-
order to be an acute rheumatic and nervous fever, which,
though not of a malignant nature, was likely to prove severe
and tedious in its operation. Here could be no deception,
and as Gertrude was almost wholly confined to her mother's
apartment, Mr. Lyndsay felt his presence was useless, and
therefore resolved on returning home. But, before he went,
he sought an interview with Miss St. Clair.
“I flattered myself," said he, “that before I lost sight of
you again, I should at least have had the satisfaction of know-
ing the nature of the evils you are exposed to-but Mrs. St.
Clair's situation puts an end to that hope for the present. I
trust I leave you in safety, and I shall not stay long away-
but if, in iny absence, anything should occur to alarm you,
promise that you will write to me instantly." Seeing her
hesitate, he quickly added, “I am not seeking to engage you
in any clandestine correspondence. I abhor all concealment

183
as much as you can do, but-must I say it ?—you require a
protector."
“I have my mother-my uncle," said she, faintly, for
she felt that her lips belied her when she named her mother,
and she shrank from the idea of appealing to her uncle ;
and, besides," added she, “I have mamma's solemn assur-
ance, that this person has left Scotland, probably for ever;"
but the manner in which she said this showed how little re-
liance she placed on this assurance.
“I cannot say to you what I think," said Mr. Lyndsay;
" but will you then promise, if ever you have the slightest
reason to suppose you are again to encounter the insolence of
that man " and Lyndsay's soft mild eyes flashed fire as
he spoke, "promise me, then, that you will instantly claim
Lord Rossville's protection?”
But Gertrude dared not promise, and she remained silent.
“As it is," continued he, “I scarcely know whether I am
justified in withholding from him what I have witnessed
6. Oh! do not, dear Mr. Lyndsay, do not, I beseech you,
breathe a syllable of what has passed to Lord Rossville, or
any one else--for my sake, do not-
• For your sake I would do much-well, then, you give me
your word

“Do not urge mewhy should you involve yourself in
trouble, perhaps in danger, for me? Already you have
risked your life to save mine-No, leave me to my fate, what-
ever it is."
“ I hate the word 'fate," said Lyndsay: "like chance, it is
a word easily pronounced, but nothing more;' so I shall not
leave you to anything so vague and mystical. As for me, I
am no duellist, and besides, this person scarcely appears to be
of that rank in society which would, what is called, entitle
him to such satisfaction. Be assured, therefore, you will find
me a bloodless champion—but without some assurance from
you, I will not leave you unprotected."
Gertrude gave him her hand
“My dear, generous cousin !" said she, much affected by
the interest he showed for her, “I promise, that if ever I
am again in difficulty, and can have recourse to your assist-
ance, I will; more I cannot—I dare not promise."
"Then, with that I must be satisfied ; look upon me as
your friend, my dear cousin, and let us leave the rest to
Heaven-Farewell !"
Lyndsay's absence caused a blank to Gertrude, which she
in vain tried to fill up-for, to an affectionate heart and
refined taste, what can supply the want of that social inter-
course, which is the very aliment of the soul ? Nothing

could be more 'triste' than this state of existence. The only
varieties she experienced were in the querulous complaints of
her mother, the verbose harangues of Lord Rossville, the
senseless questions of Lady Betty, and the twice-told com-
pliments of Mr. Delmour.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
The dreary monotony of a snow-storm now reigned in all its
morbid solemnity. All nature was shrouded in one common
covering-neither heavens nor earth offered any variety to
the wearied sight-any sound to the listening ear.
All was
sameness and stillness—'twas as the pulse of life stood still-
of time congealed; or if a sound perchance broke the dreary
silence that reigned, it fell with that dull muffled tone which
only denoted the still burdened atmosphere.
Nothing can be more desolate and depressing than this
exterior of nature to those who, assembled under one roof,
are yet strangers to those fire-side enjoyments—that home-
born happiness, which springs from social intercourse. Here
were no intimate delights-no play of fancy-no pleasures to
deceive the hours and embellish existence. Here was nothing
to palliate dulness-nothing to give time a zest-nothing to
fill the void of an unfurnished brain. There was stupor of
mind without tranquillity of soul-restlessness of body with-
out animation of spirit. Gertrude felt her heart droop
beneath the oppressive gloom which surrounded her, and
thought even actual suffering must be preferable to this total
stagnation of all enjoyment.
It was drawing towards the close of a day, when the snow
had fallen without intermission, but was now beginning to
abate. Lord Rossville stood at his drawing-room window
speculating on the aspect of the clouds, and predicting a
change of weather, when he suddenly uttered an exclamation
which attracted the whole of the family to where he stood.
A huge black object was dimly discernible entering the
avenue, and dragging its ponderous length towards the Castle;
but what was its precise nature, the still-falling snow pre-
vented their ascertaining. But suddenly the snow ceased,
the clouds rolled away, and a red brassy glare of the setting
sun fell abruptly on this moving phenomena, and disclosed to
view a stately full-plumed hearse. There was something 80
terrific, yet so picturesque, in its appearance, as it ploughed
its way through waves of snow, its sable plumes, and gilded
skulls, nodding and grinning in the now livid glimmering of

185
the fast-sinking sun, that all stood transfixed with alarm and
amazement. At length the prodigy drew near, followed by
two attendants on horseback; it drew up at the grand en-
trance--the servants gathered round-one of the men began
to remove the end-board, that threshold of death.
“This is—is~" gasped the Earl, as he tried to throw open
the window and call to his servants; but the window was
frozen, and, ere his Lordship could adopt another expedient,
his ſury was turned from the dead to the living, for there was
lifted out-not“ a slovenly unhandsome corpse, betwixt the
wind and his nobility,” but the warm, sentient, though some-
what discomfited, figure of Miss Pratt. All uttered some
characteristic exclamation; but Lord Rossville's tongue clove
to the very roof of his mouth, and he, in vain, laboured to
find words suited to the occasion.
Whether the contents of the hearse should be permitted to
enter his castle walls from such a conveyance was a doubt in
itself so weighty, as for the moment to overpower every
faculty of mind and body. True, to refuse admission to one
of the blood of Rossville, a cousin to himself, the cousin of
many noble families—the aunt of Mr. Whyte of Whyte
Hall-would be a strong measure. Yet to sanction such a
violation of all propriety 1-to suffer such an example of dis-
respect to the living, of decorum to the dead to receive
into his presence a person just issued from a hearse! Who
could tell what distempers she might not bring in her train ?
That thought decided the matter. His Lordship turned round
to pull the bell, and, in doing so, found both hands locked in
those of Miss Pratt! The shock of a man-trap is probably
faint compared to that which he experienced at finding him-
self in the grasp of the fair, and all powers of resistance
failed
under the energy of her hearty shake.
“Well, my Lord, what do you think of my travelling
equipage--my Jerusalem dilly, as Anthony Whyte calls it?
Pon my word, you must make much of me, for a pretty
business I've had to get here. I may well say I've come
through thick and thin to get to you. At one time, I assure
you, I thought you would never have seen me but in my
coffin, and a great mercy it is it's only in a hearse. I fancy
I'm the first that ever thought themselves in luck to get into
one ; but, however, I think I'm still luckier in having got
well out of it-ha! ha! ha!"
“Miss Pratt !” heaved the Earl, as with a lever.
“Well, you shall hear all about it by-and-bye. In the
meantime, I must beg the favour of you to let the men put
up their hearse and horses for the night-for it's perfectly
impossible for them to go a step further-and, indeed, I pro-

11
mised, that if they would but bring me safe here, you would
make them all welcome to a night's lodging, poor creatures!"
This was a pitch of assurance so far beyond anything Lord
Rossville had ever contemplated, that his words felt like
stones in his throat, and he strove, but strove in vain, to get
them up, and hurl them at Pratt's audacious jaws. Indeed,
all ordinary words and known language would have been
inadequate for his purpose. Only some mighty terror-com-
pelling compound, or some magical anathema--something
which would bave caused her to sink into the ground, or
have made her quit the form of a woman, and take that of an
insect, would have spoke the feelings of his breast. While
his Lordship was thus struggling, like one under the influence
of the nightmare, for utterance, Miss Pratt called to one of
the servants who just then entered,
“Jackson, you'll be so good as see these men well taken
care of, and I hope Bishop will allow a good feed to the
poor beasts! and-
“ Miss Pratt !" at length bolted the Earl, “Miss Pratt,
this conduct of yours is of so extraordinary--so altogether
unparalleled a nature, that-
* You may well say that, my Lord-unparalleled, indeed,
if
you knew all."
“There's eight horses and four men,” said Lady Betty,
who had been pleasing her fancy by counting them. " Who's
burial is it?"
“ It's Mr. M'Vitae's, the great distiller. I'm sure, I'm
much obliged to him; for if it hadn't been for him, poor
man! I might have been stiff and stark by this time." And
Miss Pratt busied herself in taking off her snow shoes, and
turning and chafing herself before the fire.
“ Miss Pratt," again began the Earl, mustering all his
energies, “ Miss Pratt, it is altogether inconceivable and in-
explicable to me, how you, or any one else, could possibly 80
far forget what was due to themselves and me, as to come to
my house in a manner so wholly unprecedented, so altogether
unwarrantable, 80–80–80 perfectly unjustifiable-I say, how
any person or persons could thus presume--
A burst of laughter from Miss Pratt here broke in upon
the Earl's harangue.
My dear Lord Rossville, I beg your pardon; but really
the notion of my presuming to come in a hearse is too good.
'Pon my word, it's a piece of presumption few people would
be guilty of if they could help it. I assure you I felt hum-
ble enough when I was glad to creep into it.”
“I repeat presume, Miss Pratt," cried his Lordship, now
fairly kindled into eloquence, “to presume to bring to my

house an equipage and attendants of-of-of the most lucti-
ferous description, and further, to presume to expect that I
am to permit the hearse of Mr. M'Vitae, the distiller-the-
the democratic distiller, with eight horses and four men, to-
to-to-to-to transform Rossville Castle into an inn-a-a
caravansera of the very lowest description-a-2-a charnel-
house—–—a receptacle for vehicles employed for the
foulest—the vilest-the-the most unseemly of all purposes !
Jackson, desire those people, with their carriage and horses,
to quit my grounds without one moment's delay."
My dear Lord Rossville !-(Stop, Jackson)-Bless my
heart ! you're not going to turn away the people at this time
of night! Only look how it's snowing, and the sky as black
as pitch ; there's neither man nor beast fit to travel a foot
this night. Jackson, I'm sure you must be sensible that it's
perfectly impossible for them to find their way now.
Jackson, who had, like his betters, felt considerable ennui
during the storm, and rather rejoiced at the thoughts of any
visitors, however inferior to himself in rank and station, con-
firmed the assertion with all due respect—but to little pur-
pose.
" At all events, and whatever may be the consequence,"
said his master, " they certainly can, and, indeed, positively
must, return by the road which they have recently tra-
versed."
“They may just as well attempt to fly as to go back the
way they came; a pretty fight they had to get through! I
only wish you had seen it—the horses up to their shoulders
more than once in the snow, even then, and it's now snowing
ten times worse than ever-s0 I leave you to judge how they
are to drag a hearse back nine miles at this time of night.”
Here Jackson re-entered with a manifesto from the hearse-
drivers and company, stating, that they had been brought two
miles and a half out of their way under promise of being
provided in quarters for the night, and that it was now im-
possible for them to proceed.
“It will be a pretty story if I'm landed in a lawsuit,"
cried Miss Pratt, in great alarm, as the Earl was about to re-
iterate his orders ; " and it will make a fine noise in the
county, I can tell you.",
Mr. Delmour, who had been out investigating matters,
here struck in, and, having remarked that it might be an un-
popular measure, recommended that Mr. M*Vitae's suite
should be accommodated for the night, with strict charges to
depart by dawn the following morning ; and the Earl, though
with great reluctance, was prevailed upon to agree to this
arrangement.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
Miss PRATT, having carried her point, and dried, warmed, fed,
and cherished her person in all possible ways, now commenced
the narrative of what she called her unparalleled adventures.
But, as has been truly said, there are always two ways of tell-
ing a story, and Miss Pratt's biographer and herself are by
no means at one as to the motives which led to this extra-
ordinary expedition. Miss Pratt set forth that she had been
living most comfortably at Skinflint Cottage, where she had
been most kindly treated and much pressed to prolong her
visit ; but she had taken an anxious fit about her good friends
at Rossville, she had had a great dreaming about them the
night before last, and she could not rest till she had seen
them all. She had, therefore, borrowed the Skinflint car-
riage, and set out at the risk of her life—but the horses had
stuck in the snow, &c., &c.
Miss Pratt's biographer, on the other hand, asserts that
Miss Pratt, in the course of circulation, had landed at Skinflint
Cottage, which she sometimes used as a stepping-stone, but
never as a resting-place ; here, however, she had been taken
prisoner by the snow-storm, and confined for a week in a
small house full of children--some in measles, some in scarlet
fevers, some in hooping-coughs; the only healthy individuals,
two strong unruly boys just broke loose from school for the
holidays. The fare was bad-her bed was hard-her blankets
heavy-her pillows few-her curtains thin—and her room,
which was next to the nursery, to use her own expression,
smoked like a killogie.
To sum up the whole, it was a retreat of Miss Becky Du-
guid's, and at this very time Miss Becky was in such requi-
sition, that it was resolved to send the carriage for her, in
the double hope, that, as Rossville Castle was in the way,
her guest would avail herself of the opportunity of taking
her departure. Accordingly, a pair of old, stiff, starved,
superannuated horses were yoked to a large, heavy family
coach, to which Miss Pratt joyfully betook herself even in
the
very
teeth of the storm. But the case was a desperate
one, for she had received several broad hints about one of the
children in the booping-cough, Charles Fox by name, having
taken a fancy to sleep with her, in consequence of her having,
in an unwary fit of generosity, presented it with a pepper-
mint drop. But all these minute particulars Miss Pratt

passed over, which occasions some little discrepancy betwixt
herself and her faithful biographer, but from this point they
can now proceed hand in hand.
The old horses tugged their way through the snow most
manfully, till they came to Cocklestonetop Muir, and there
it lay so deep as to baffle their utmost exertions. After every
other alternative had been tried in vain, there remained no
other than to leave the carriage, and for Miss Pratt, her green
bag, and the coachman, to mount the horses, and proceed to
the nearest habitation. But the snow fell thick and fast-
Miss Pratt could not keep her seat on the bare back of a huge,
stiff plough-horse, whose every movement threatened dislo-
cation, if not dissolution, and even her dauntless spirit was
sinking beneath the horrors of her situation, when, as she
expressed it, by mere dint of good luck, up came Mr.
M Vitae's hearse, drawn by six stout horses, who had been
living, for the last two days, at heck and manger in Mr.
M'Vitae's well-filled stables. After a little parley, and many
promises, they were induced, nothing loath indeed, to turn out
of the way, and deposit Miss Pratt and her bag at Rossville
Castle.
But even this account failed to still the tumult in the Earl's
breast; there was something in having a hearse, and the
hearse of Mr. M'Vitae, the radical distiller, thus forced with-
in his walls, he could not away with. Death, even in its most
dignified attitude, with all its proudest trophies, would still
have been an appalling spectacle to Lord Rossville ; but, in its
present vulgar and almost burlesque form, it was altogether in-
supportable. Death is indeed an awful thing, whatever
aspect it assumes. The King of Terrors gives to other attri-
butes their power of terrifying: the thunder's roar-the
lightning's flash—the billow's roar—the earthquake's shock-
all derive their dread sublimity from Death. All are but the
instruments of his resistless sway.
From these, and even from his more ordinary emissaries,
Lord Rossville felt secure: but still a lurking fear had taken
possession of his mind, and he could not divest himself of the
train of ideas, which had been excited by beholding, in horrid
array, Death's cavalcade approach his dwelling. He passed
a restless night-he thought of what the county would say,
and what he should say to the county-he thought of, whe-
ther he would not be justified in banishing Miss Pratt for ever
from his
presence.
When the first faint grey streak of light
appeared, he rang his bell to inquire whether the funeral pro-
cession had departed; but a fresh fall of snow, during the
night, had placed the castle and hearse in a complete state of
blockade. He rose and opened the window to ascertain the

fact, but nothing was to be seen but a fast-falling, blinding
snow; he next went to the door, but there the snow lay six
feet deep; he returned to bed, but not to sleep-and when
his servant entered in the morning, he found his master a
lifeless corse.
Whence it came, who can tell? Whether from cold, men-
tal disquiet, or irreversible decree ?
“When houre of death is come, let none aske whence nor
why !"
CHAPTER XL.
GERTRUDE was now Countess of Rossville and how often
had her heart bounded at the anticipation! How slight a
thing seems the life or death of an individual, to whom we
are united by no ties of affection, when merely thought of, as
to be or not to be, and Death and his awful attributes are not
made manifest to our senses. But how sad and solemn, when
we come to witness, even in those most alien to us, the last
struggle—the dread change the total extinction of mor-
tality.
As the youthful Countess looked on her uncle's cold re-
mains she forgot all her dreams of vanity, and wept in real
sadness, as she thought how many a painful emotion of anger
and disappointment she had excited in that now still, uncon-
scious form. Oh! how bitter are the upbraidings which
come to us from the lips of the dead! Would that the living
could lay the too tardy reflection to heart !
Gertrude could not blame herself, but she sorrowed in the
sorrow of a warm ingenuous heart, that she should ever have
offended the pale and peaceful image now stretched before
her. But tears,
though shed in earnest, are, alas I often shed
in vain.
The funeral obsequies were celebrated with a pomp of
heraldry—a display of solemn state—which would, if aught
on earth could, have brightened the dull cold eye of the dead
to have witnessed.
The Earl had left no settlements; he had destroyed his
original ones, and been planning others of a totally different
nature, which, had he lived, would certainly have been put
in execution, to the utter exclusion of Lady Rossville, unless
as the wife of Mr. Delmour.
The want of a will is a desideratum which invariably
causes disappointment to many an expectant. Perhaps, on
the late occasion, no one felt more chagrined at the failure of

the Earl's than Miss Pratt. Although there was little differ-
ence in their ages, yet from being of a lighter and more ac-
tive nature, she had always looked upon herself as at least
twenty years younger, and had all along settled in her own
mind that he was to die long before her; and from having at
first contemplated the possibility of his leaving her a small
legacy, she had next considered it as highly probable that he
would leave her something very handsome, and, at length,
all her doubts had resolved themselves into the absolute cer-
tainty of his doing something highly to his own credit. Not,
to do her justice, that she looked to it so much for her own
aggrandisement, as for something to bequeath to Anthony
Whyte in his necessities; as she declared, that, in these times,
Anthony found he was pinched enough with his three thou-
Miss Pratt could not, therefore, reconcile herself to this
desideratum; but spent her days in rummaging the house,
and expressing ber amazement (which, far from lessening,
seemed daily to increase) that the will—for a will there
must be should be missing, and her nights in dreaming that
the will had been found. The will, she was certain, would
cast up yet-nobody knew poor Lord Rossville better than
she did—she might say they had been like brother and sister
all their lives, and nobody that knew him, worthy, well-
meaning man that he was, could ever believe that he would
go out of the world and leave things all at sixes and sevens.
Not so much as ten guineas even for a mourning ring to his
oldest friends and nearest relations—the thing was quite im-
possible. She only wished she had access to his repositories,
she was sure she would soon bring something to light-some
bit of paper, or letter, or jotting, or something or another, just
to show what his intentions were, and she was sure Lady
Rossville would willingly act up to it, whatever it was, for he
was a just, upright, friendly, liberal, well-principled, well-
meaning, kind-hearted man - an honourable-minded man,
with a great deal of strong natural affection-a man that had
always, and upon all occasions, shown himself her steady
friend and well-wisher, &c., &c. There was one drawer in parti-
cular, the right-hand drawer of his writing-table, the end
next the window-she had several times when she had occa-
sion to speak to him in his study found him busy there. Poor
man ! the very last time she saw him there he was working
amongst some papers in that very drawer. She wondered if
it had been well searched, and so on.
Gertrude had no doubt but that due search had been made
there as in other places by the constituted authorities, and
she had too much respect for the late Earl's feelings when

on
living to suffer Miss Pratt to invade his repositories now that
he was dead; but, weary of hearing the same changes rung upon
this drawer, she one day suddenly resolved to examine it, and
some other of her uncle's private repositories. For that pur-
pose she repaired to his apartment and began her scrutiny.
It was with a feeling of solemnity she displaced the relics of
the departed, and sought in vain for any indication of his
will or intentions-nothing of the kind was to be seen, for
nothing of the kind was in existence-only bundles of bills,
and packets of letters, were contained in the drawer, which
Miss Pratt had vainly flattered herself held her future for-
tunes. The Countess was about to close it when her eye was
arrested by one of those packets—it was titled “Correspon-
dence with Colonel F. Delmour-Private-No. I."
6. Can this be the correspondence,” thought she, “
which the happiness of my life depends ?" and her colour
ebbed and flowed as the contending emotions of hope and
fear rushed over her heart. “ And am I justified in thus
stealing on the secrets of the dead-is it right—is it ho-
nourable ?" she paused. “Yet my all of happiness is at stake,
why should I hesitate ?." And with a trembling hand she un-
folded the copy of a letter from Lord Rossville, written, it
seemed, on his first discovering the attachment that existed.
It was very angry and very wordy, and the substance of it
was calling upon his nephew instantly to resign all preten-
sions to Miss St. Clair's hand, and to authorise him to annul
any engagement subsisting between them upon pain of his most
serious displeasure. Gertrude's heart throbbed violently as
she turned to the answer to this in the well-known careless
elegant hand of her lover. It was short, expressed the
deepest regret at having incurred his uncle's displeasure,
pleaded the excess of his passion as the only excuse, and de-
clared, in the most unequivocal terms, the utter impossibility
there was in his ever complying with his Lordship’s com-
mands by relinquishing that which was dearer to him than
life.
Tears of delight burst from Gertrude's eyes as she read
this decided avowal of unalterable attachment.
“ How could I be so base as ever to doubt, ungenerous
that I am ?" was her first exclamation; and, in the exultation
of the moment, she felt as though worlds could never again for a
moment shake her faith. But there were more letters to
peruse. The next in order was another from Lord Rossville.
It was in part a repetition of what her uncle had said to her-
self when he declared his intention of disinheriting her, and
settling the estates upon Mr. Delmour, but his resolutions were
still more strongly expressed and fully detailed in the letter;

193
and he concluded by an offer of instantly liquidating his
nephew's debts, and settling ten thousand pounds upon him
provided he would come under an engagement never to marry
Miss St. Clair.
“ This, then, is the test !" thought Gertrude ; and, with a
beating heart, she opened another letter in Colonel Delmour's
handwriting, and read as follows :-
“ MY DEAR UNCLE,
“ It was only on my return here late last night
that I found your letter, and I have passed a sleepless night
ruminating on the heart-rending alternative you offer to me.
Were my own interests solely at stake I should not hesitate
a single moment, but the thought of reducing the adored ob-
ject of my affections to poverty—of being the means of be-
reaving her of the possessions of her ancestors, and depriving
her of your favour, is so overwhelming that I find myself
quite unable to come to any conclusion at present. Heaven
knows how much I could endure for her sake; but it is tor-
ture to me to think of her sacrificing so much for mine. Yet
to resign her for ever is distraction. I repeat, it is impossible
for me, all at once, to resolve upon a point on which the hap-
piness of my life is at issue. Pray allow me a few days to form
my resolution, and believe it is my most earnest wish to gra-
tify you in all possible ways. The regiment is on the point of
embarking for Gibraltar, but I expect Brookes to take the
command, and that I shall obtain leave to remain at home for
the present.
You shall hear from me again whenever I can
summon resolution to cast the die. Meantime you will, of
course, suspend all further proceedings. Believe me,
“My dear Uncle,
6 Yours with the sincerest esteem and affection,
"F. M. H. DELMOUR."
“P.S.—You may rely upon my secrecy, and I agree with
you that it is better George should not be made acquainted
with what has passed-at present."
Here was "confirmation, strong as proofs of holy writ,” to
the generous confiding heart of the Countess.
Yes, it was upon her account that he hesitated-it was for
her happiness that he was tempted to sacrifice his own. Ah!
how little did he know her if he deemed that wealth and
grandeur could ever stand in competition with his affection
-that, the peculiar treasure of her soul—that, the pearl of
great price—the rest, was it not all mere earthly dross ? With-
out that, what were rank and fortune to her ? But to share
them, to bestow them upon the chosen of her heart, was, in-

deed, a blissful privilege ! And the whole tenor of her mind
became bright. Impatient to vindicate the honour of her
lover, she hastened to her mother's apartment. She found
Mrs. St. Clair in the same posture in which she had so fre-
quently observed her since the Earl's death, seated at a writ-
ing-table, her head resting on one hand, a pen in the other,
as ií meditating how to begin letter, which, after all this
preparation, did not appear yet to have been commenced.
With cheeks glowing, and eyes sparkling with triumph and
delight, Gertrude placed the packet in her hands.
“Read these, mamma,” said she in a tone of exultation ;
"and if ever you had a doubt, surely these must satisfy
you.”
Mrs. St. Clair took the letters, and read them in silence-
then, as she folded up the last, she said with a sarcastic
smile, -
“My doubts are, indeed, ended—I am now confirmed in
what I have all along suspected;
Colonel Delmour loved you
from the first as the heiress of Rossville, as the Countess of
Rossville I have no doubt he will adore you."
Gertrude was struck dumb-her mother went on,-
“It is evident to me—it would be to any one in their senses
-that the only struggle here is caused by self-interest. He,
like many other people, doubted whether Lord Rossville
really possessed the power of disinheriting you; and he,
therefore, prudently evades the question, until he has ascer-
tained that point. It would have been selling his right, in-
deed, for a mess of pottage, to have resigned the heiress to
twenty thousand a-year for a paltry ten thousand pounds, and
the payment of his tailor's bill—but, on the other hand-
"It is enough," said Lady Rossville, as, with a burning
cheek, and in a tone of wounded feeling, she collected the
letters, and was turning to leave the room.
“No, Gertrude, it is not enough,” cried her mother, point-
ing to her to be seated; "sit down, and listen to me, at
least with calmness, if not with respect, I will not be inter-
rupted—I will be heard.”
Her daughter seated herself in silence, but evidently strug-
gling with her feelings.
“I cannot see you, as I do, the dupe of an artful, unprin-
cipled man, without making an effort to open your eyes to the
dangers of your situation ; yet I own, I almost despair when
I behold you thus wilfully closing them against the light,
which would carry conviction to any mind that was not the
slave of its own delusions—yes, I repeat, it is clear as noon-
day, that it is solely as the heiress of Rossville you are the
object of Colonel Delmour's attachment. He hesitate about

reducing the adored object of his affections to poverty !-he
distracted at the thoughts of bereaving her of the possessions
of her ancestors! Stutt! Who that knows anything of the
character of the man, would, for an instant, believe that he
would hesitate about sacrificing the whole world, were it to
promote his own interest ? Gertrude, I would not unneces-
sarily pain you, but I consider it my duty to save you from
the snares I see set for you.-Why should you distrust me?
-What interest can I have in deceiving you, my
child ?”
“I know not-I cannot tell," said the Countess with a
sigh ; “if I am distrustful-
She stopped, but Mrs. St. Clair felt the reproach implied
in her look and accent.
66 'Tis I who have made you so, you would say ; yet you
can distrust me-your guide your companion-your friend -
your mother!" "Mrs. St. Clair's voice here faltered with
emotion; "although you cannot even doubt the faith of one,
who, but a few months since, was an utter stranger to you."
“But in those few months, what have I not learnt ?" said
Lady Rossville in much agitation; "enough to make me
sometimes doubt the evidence of my own senses-certainly
enough to teach me to distrust even my own mother."
Mrs. St. Clair's face crimsoned.
“Beware how you provoke me, Gertrude !" cried she with
much vehemence; " I will endure no taunts or reproaches
from you, for, with one word, I could lay all your romantic
dreams in the dust. Although, as Countess of Rossville, you
may wish to forget what is due to me as your mother, I will
not relinquish my claims to you as my daughter. I will be
obeyed !" continued she with increasing violence, “and I
command you from henceforth to think of that man no
more."
“Then you command me to do what is impossible," said
the Countess, giving way to tears. "Oh! mamma! why will
you force me to this alternative? Why must I be accounted
rebellious—undutiful-because I cannot see as you see, and
think as you think? I call Heaven to witness, I would ever
render to you the respect—the reverence of a child, but I
cannot-no, I cannot--yield you the submission of a slave."
6. And where is the child who owes to a parent what you
owe to me?” demanded Mrs. St. Clair warmly ;
the child possessed of such an inheritance-of rank-of power
-of riches—of beauty—of talents?—and where is the mother
who would not feel as I do, at seeing them all sacrificed to
the cupidity of an artful, unprincipled man?"
“And is it because I possess all these advantages, that I
am to be denied the privilege of the poorest and humblest ?”
66 where is

?"
asked Lady Rossville, her voice faltering with emotion: "of
what value to me are all those gifts, if I may not share them
with those I love? ah! how much rather would I forego
them all
“Than not indulge your own weak, wayward, childish
fancy," cried her mother with indignation ; “this is not to
be borne! How shall I tear that bandage from your eyes ?
-If you doubt me, will you credit the testimony of your
friend-your counsellor-your Platonic admirer, Mr. Lynd-
say
“I respect and esteem Mr. Lyndsay,” said the Countess,
6 but I will not adopt his prejudices."
“Will you believe the voice of the world, then?”
" I already know all that the world can say. It will tell
me he is thoughtless-extravagant-imprudent-erring, it
may be, in many things—but all that he has told me himself
-such he once was-till-till he loved."
Mrs. St. Clair groaned. “ Then whose testimony will you
admit, since you reject mine ?-you reject Mr. Lyndsay's-
you reject that of the whole world.”
“I will receive none,” said Lady Rossville mildly, but
firmly—"erring, perhaps faulty, he may have been ; but to
doubt that he loves me there, I will receive no one's tes-
timony but his own."
“Then you are lost !” exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, in violent
agitation, “but it must not-shall not be. You dare not
marry without my consent—without the consent of
stopped-“I tell you—"
“It I am to be ruled by any authority it must be solely by
my mother's," said Gertrude proudly ; " no other being has,
or ever
can have, the right to control me on this point. Once
before I promised, that I would form no engagement without
your consent until I had attained the age of twenty-one-I
am now willing to repeat it, but, in the meantime, my pre-
ference must be left free. And now, mamma, let us end this
strife--it
may

my misfortune to differ from you-do not-
oh! do not let that difference divide us—I will be always
yours in affection, it not in sentiment.” And she would have
embraced her, but her mother repelled her.
“Such a compromise is a mere mockery,” said she with
bitterness; “but I too am sick of altercation-such as it is,
then, for the present your promise must suffice — let me
trust in Heaven that your delusion may be dispelled ere it be
too late !"
“If it is a delusion, I too join in the prayer,” said the
Countess, but more in the tone of lofty assurance than of
lawly supplication.

This contest with her mother only served to strengthen
Gertrude emas violence invariably does—in her own opinions.
There was something too in the very suspense calculated to
give a play to her imagination, and fascinate the youthful
heart far more than any sober certainty of waking bliss could
have done. She would have shrunk from acknowledging
even to herself that she harboured a doubt; but how many
a stranger feeling mingles unknown to ourselves with the
home-born sentiments of our hearts !
CHAPTER XLI.
There was a duty which Gertrude was particularly anxious
to discharge, and that was the debt she had incurred to Mr.
Adam Ramsay. Having procured a bill for the money, she,
therefore, ordered her carriage one day, and having con-
trived to elude the curiosity of Lady Betty and the vigilance
of Miss Pratt, she set out alone, in hopes of making her
peace--at any rate of relieving her mind from the weight of
pecuniary obligation. A thaw had begun—but just begun,
consequently both earth and atmosphere were in that raw,
chill, dubious state which combines all the discomforts of
foul and frosty weather, and even in the narrow precincts of
uncle Adam's parterre, both were displayed in perfection.
The snow, though soft, lay deep betwixt his house and the
little gate which separated him from the road; no attempt
had been made to clear it away or open a passage ; and an
avalanche, which had fallen from the roof of the house, lay
undisturbed upon the steps, and effectually blocked up the
door. Altogether it had a desolate uninhabited look, dif-
ferent from the neatly-scraped paths and sanded steps be-
longing to the houses on either side, and Gertrude began to
fear, she knew not what, from this desolate exterior. Mean-
while, the footman, having with some difficulty contrived to
wade up to the door, knocked loud and long in all the energy
of insolence and ill-humour, but no answer was returned.
Again and again the summons was repeated, in a manner
enough to have raised even the drowsy porter in Macbeth,
but with no better success. At length the servant turned
away in despair.
“There is nobody within, my lady." But at that moment
his lady's eye was caught by a view of the back of uncle
Adam's wig, as its queue hung in expressive silence over a
chair in the parlour. It retained its posture, however, so

immovably, that it seemed as though it would have required
a touch of galvanism to ascertain whether it were suspended
from a dead or a living skull. Alarmed at the immobility of
this appendage of uncle Adam's brain, Lady Rossville has-
tily called to have the carriage door opened, and, without
exactly knowing what she would or could do, she stepped
out, and made the best of her way through the snow towards
the house. Scarcely had she touched the door when, to her
surprise, it flew open, as if impelled by the invisible hands of
the White Cat herself. No invisible hands were there, how-
ever, for there stood uncle Adam in propria persona,' with
his pig-tail and his cold blue radish-looking fingers.
"Come in—come in,” cried he, in no very inviting tone,
as Gertrude stood for a moment transfixed with astonishment
at this sudden resuscitation ; “I'm sure this is no weather to
be stan'in' at open doors," and violently shutting it, he led
the way to his little parlour. A dead fire, a dirty hearth,
and the remains of a wretched breakfast, were the only traces
of civilisation to be descried.
“I was afraid something was the matter,” said Gertrude,
as she entered. “My servant knocked repeatedly, but
could get no answer, but I am happy to find it was a false
alarm, and that I have the pleasure of seeing you well, my
dear uncle."
Mr. Ramsay hemmed-
“ You may see something's the matter, or the things
wadnae be stan'in' there till this time o' day—there's naebody
in the hoos but mysel'; and I wasna gawn to play the flunky
to thae idle puppies o’ yours," pointing to the Countess's
dashing lacquey, as he strutted before the window; “and I
never wish to see ony body at my door that canna chap at it
themsel's;" then muttering between his teeth, “fules should
nae hae chappin-sticks," he seemed to recover a little at
having thus vented his venom in ignominious epithets applied
to his niece and her spruce serving-man.
Lady Rossville was much at a loss how to proceed. At no
time did she perfectly comprehend the breadth of uncle
Adam's dialect; but, on the present occasion, he was more
than usually unintelligible; and, as she could neither divine
what was meant by fules nor chappin-sticks, she prudently
passed them over, and proceeded to business.
“I am come to repay my debt to you," said she, in her
sweetest manner; " that is, the pecuniary part of it; but
your generous trust and confidence in me I never can re-
pay. My dear uncle, will you accept of my warmest—my
most grateful thanks for your kindness ?" And she put
the money, inclosed in a pocket-book of her own embroider.

did so.
money?”
“An' what has that to do wi't?” demanded Mr. Ramsay,
eyeing the souvenir with no gracious aspect.
“ That is a pocket-book I have worked on purpose for
you; and I hope you will keep it for my sake."
“Weel, I may do sae ; though it's nonsense to gi'e me the
like o' thae foolish things ;” and taking out the bill, he care-
fully wrapped the pocket-book in a piece of paper, and open-
ing an old bureau that stood in the corner of the room, de-
posited it in a little drawer, then cautiously locking it,
returned to his seat. “ Next to no borrowin' the best thing's
ready payin', and I'm glad to see you hae that muckle dis-
cretion;" and his features gradually relaxed into a more
benign expression, as he slowly took out his spectacles to
peruse the bill; when, suddenly resuming their usual stormy
cast -6. What's this?” cried he, “whar's the interest for my
In great confusion at this unthought-of demand, Gertrude
apologised by saying, she had been so little accustomed to
money transactions, that she had entirely forgot that part of
the claim.
"I think it's time you was learnin' something o' the vaala
o' money, noo that ye've learnt hoo to spend and to borrow
sae readily. I dinna care ae bodle about it for my ain part,
but I like to see folk ken what they're aboot, and gie awbody
their due ;" and taking up an old blackened stump of a pen,
he began to cast up his account on the back of the bill; then
showing it to Lady Rossville, “There's what I was inteetled
to frae you; but I tell you I dinna want it-I only want to
mak you sensible o' what you're aboot."
Gertrude acknowledged the justice of his admonition, and,
having thanked him for it, she was again taken into favour,
but it was of short duration.
“Hae nae you got your feet wat wi' that snaw ?” said he
in a complacent tone—then glancing at her little silk slippers,
all his wrath revived. “ Bonny like feet, to be sure, to be
wadin' through the snaw! I thought you had mair sense than
till hae come oot wi' such daft-like things in such weather-
they're liker dancing schule pumps than sensible walkin'
shoes."
And uncle Adam walked up and down in great discompo-
sure, his own huge leathern buckets creaking at every step.
“ Í did not know all I had to encounter, else I certainly
should have provided better for it,” said Gertrude, smiling;
“but I am not at all subject to colds, so don't be alarmed on that

account, and when your servant comes in, she will dry my
shoes at your kitchen fire."
“You'll sit awhile before you see ony servant o'mine ; I
hae nae servant, and the kitchen fire's black oot.”
“No servant, and no fire !” exclaimed Lady Rossville,
horror-struck at such an avowal. “Good Heavens! what a
situation! how-what has occasioned this ?”
“ Just the occasion is, that that impudent thief that's been
wi' me these twa year, thought proper to own a marriage wi' a
scoondrell o' a dragoon that she ne'er saw till within this
month ; and what do you think o' her assurance ? She had
the impudence to tell me last night that she must leave my
service immediately, unless I wad buy her husband's dis-
charge, tak' him into my service, and settle an annuity
on her for life. I daursay there ne'er was the like o't !"
“That was certainly very audacious," said Gertrude,
" and she ought, at least, to have remained until you had
procured another servant."
“Her remain ! do ye think I wad left mysel' at the dis-
craation o' such a slut as that? I just took her by the
shoothers, and gie'd her the outside o' the door for her

vengeance. Tak’a dragoon into my service! I wad just as
soon tak’ the hangman into my service !"
“What a picture of lonely old age !” thought Gertrude--

destitute even of the necessaries of life-- how dismal I"
Even the unfortunate peculiarity of his temper, which
kept him aloof from all fellowship with others, she viewed-
as, indeed, it was—as an additional misfortune, and she felt
anxious to alleviate the wretchedness of his state by every
means in his power. But to have insinuated to uncle Adam,
that his comfort at all depended either upon a servant or a
fire, would have been an insult he would have resented
accordingly.
“ You must come to Rossville with me, my dear uncle,"
said the Countess, taking his hand with her sweetest look
and accent of entreaty.
“Me gang to Rossville !” exclaimed Mr. Ramsay, with
a sudden start of horror ; “I'll do nae such thing—what
wad tak' me to Rossville ?"
“To pay me a visit-to give me the pleasure of seeing you
in my own house ; you know you must visit me some time :
and this is so good an opportunity, that, indeed, I will not
excuse you."
“I suppose you think I canna contrive to live fower-and-

ony rate, there's a tyelor and his wife, down bye there, very
discreet folk, that wad be ready to do onything I wanted, so
you need nae fash your heed aboot me.”
“I have no doubt you could have abundance of service,"
said Lady Rossville, still persisting in her benevolent inten-
tions—to say nothing of your own domestics at Bloom
Park. My aunts, too ; I am sure, if they knew of your
situation

" what's my situation ? A great situation, to be sure, to ha'e

that's what you ca' my situation. What else could you say if

“I beg your pardon--but you must make allowance for
my blunders. You know my tongue is not so Scotch as my
heart; and that is another reason why you must come
to Rossyille to give me some lessons in my dear native
accents. I must now learn to speak Scotch to my poor
people.". And Gertrude hung coaxingly round him, till even
uncle Adam's flinty nature began to melt.
" What wad ye mak o' me at your braw castell, amang aw

“I assure you we have no fine people at Rossville, my dear

quiet, old-fashioned family-quite clock-work in our ways
and hours ; and besides, if you don't like them or us, you
shall take your own way in everything. You shall breakfast,

her."
Gertrude was certainly not a persevering character; and,
despairing of success, she had risen to depart, when her
heart smote her at the thoughts of abandoning the desolate
old man to his cheerless solitary state—at his advanced age,
and in such inclement weather, to be left in a house alone I -
the idea was frightful. Again she returned to the charge,

and at length she prevailed; for she held out an inducement
uncle Adam was not proof against. She told him of the
picture he would see at Rossville, of her he had so truly
loved, and the right string was touched. A silken thread
might have led uncle Adam over half the globe when Lizzie
Lundie was paramount. His little preparations were soon
made; the tailor's wife was summoned, and invested with
the charge of the mansion; and Mr. Ramsay, covered with
shame and confusion at his own folly in being thus led by a
child, sneaked into the carriage with his head on his breast,
and his ears hanging down to his shoulders. Lady Rossville
tried to animate him, but he still retained his humble dis-
comfited air, till the carriage stopped at the castle gate, when
the old man burst forth,-
" I've a gude mind just to gang
back the
way I cam-aula
idiot that I am, to be rinnin' after pickters like a bairn ? "
But it was now too late—the movements of the great are
commonly conducted with a celerity that baffles all calculation;
and uncle Adam was scarcely aware that he had reached his
destination, ere he found himself in the hall surrounded by a
train of servants. All that was left for him, therefore, was to
scowl upon them as he passed along ; but they were too
well-bred to testify, either mirth or surprise at sight of such a
phenomenon, and, in spite of himself, he was ushered to the
saloon with all the customary demonstrations of respect. It
was vacant; and Lady Rossville having safely deposited him
by the side of a blazing fire, and vainly tried to persuade
him to partake with her of some refreshment, left him for a
little, to solace himself with the newspapers of the day, while
she went to announce his arrival to her mother.
CHAPTER XLII.
WHEN Gertrude had left her mother in the morning, she had
left her, as usual, fretful and gloomy ; but, on returning, she
was struck with the change, which, in the course of a few
hours, had taken place. Her countenance was lightened—
her air was almost joyous; and, though some slight traces of
agitation were visible, yet it was evidently of no painful kind,
for the tout ensemble' was that of a person who had thrown
off a load of cares and of fears. She was seated at her
toilette, which, ever since the Earl's death, had been much
neglected ; but, upon her daughter's entrance, she dismissed
her maid.

" Come away, my love,” cried she, holding out her arms,
and affectionately embracing her; “I have been tiring to
“ Where have you been, my sweetest ?”
Gertrude, but not without wondering at this sudden over-
flow of love and tenderness, related to her the particulars of
her visit to Mr. Ramsay, and its consequences.
“Ahl nothing could be better managed," said Mrs. St.
Clair; "and his arrival to-day is quite apropos, as I mean to
make my appearance at dinner, and it may very well pass for
a compliment to my good uncle;" then, changing her tone to
one of deep solemnity-"Since I saw you in the morning,
love, I have been a good deal shocked with a piece of news I
accidentally stumbled upon, in a provincial paper I happened
to take up-my nerves, to be sure, have been sadly shattered
of late," and she sighed and took up her smelling-bottle.-
“But 'tis impossible not to be struck with such an event-
Gertrude, you have no longer anything to fear from that un-
fortunate man; he-he has perished 1” added she in strong
but transient emotion.
Gertrude involuntarily, shuddered. There is always some-
thing revolting in the gaiety that springs from the death of a
fellow being; and, for a moment, she turned away her head
from the wild unnatural pleasure that gleamed in her mo-
" What was this man's life or death to me?" exclaimed she
suddenly. Surely now the time is come, when you will tell
me all !"
“ Not now, my love do not urge me—the time may come
when I shall have no secret with you, but, at present, it can
serve no purpose but that of agitating and distressing me.
Perhaps I should not have mentioned this disagreeable occur-
rence to you at all, but for the fear that it might have come
upon you unawares, and so have betrayed you into some
symptom of recognition that had better be avoided; for, I
think, you could scarcely fail to be struck as I was at read-
ing the account. As yet, it has got no further than the Barn-
ford Chronicle, but it will, of course, appear in the London
papers, and you will probably hear it read and commented on
at all hands, so 'tis better you should receive it from mine-
forewarned 'is forearmed;" and taking up a newspaper, she
pointed out a paragraph under the head of “Melancholy
Shipwreck.” It set forth, in the usual terms, a most elabo-
rate and high-drawn narrative of the wreck of the Dauntless
Packet, bound for America, on the coast of Ireland, when
every soul on board had perished. Several pieces of the
wreck, and some of the bodies of the unhappy sufferers, had
been cast on shore, and were all minutely described, amongst
ther's eye.

others, that of a “gentleman, seemingly turned of thirty
years of age, tall, fair complexion, light hair, blue eyes, high
nose, linen marked J. L. On his person were found a watch,
a small sum of money, and a pocket-book, the latter contain-
ing papers and bills, but so much damaged by the water, that
the writing was wholly obliterated—only on one of the bills,
the letters •S lair' could be traced, and those were the
only marks which could throw any light on the unfortunate
gentleman's identity," &c., &c., &c.
“It is very sad to be called upon to rejoice over an event
fraught with so much misery," said the Countess with a sigh,
as she finished it.
"I do not call upon you to rejoice, Gertrude," said Mrs.
St. Clair, solemnly. “God forbid that I should ! I merely
wished you to see that you have nothing more to fear in that
quarter."
“ But, after all, mamma, how can you be quite sure that
this ill-fated sufferer is the very person you suppose-Lewis-
ton?”
“ Because I have it under his own hand, that he had
actually engaged his passage in that very vessel; and it is
surely very improbable that there should have been two men
on board a small packet answering so completely to the same
description in every particular; and, even if there were, both
must have shared the same fate. And now let us drop the
subject, and everything relating to it. Should it pass without
any observation from those two tiresome fools, Lady Betty
and Miss Pratt, 'tis well; if it is noticed and commented
upon, you will, of course, be prepared to talk about it as any
one else would do."
" But Mr. Lyndsay ?” said Gertrude—“surely you will
explain everything to him ?"
"I have already explained enough to Mr. Lyndsay," said
Mrs. St. Clair, angrily.—“I know not what more he would
require."
* Yet you said you had promised to lay open the whole
“But the whole is now at an end; and I do not feel myself
called upon to revive old and disagreeable stories, merely to
gratify his curiosity."
“In justice to yourself—to me," said Gertrude, urgently,
'you ought not to lose a moment in clearing up, if possi-
ble, everything that appears wrong in your conduct and in
mine."
“In justice to myself,” said Mrs. St. Clair, colouring with
anger, I will not harrow up my feelings, and endanger my
health, by recurring to anything of a painful or agitating na-

ture at present. Mr. Lyndsay, I repeat, knows all that it is
necessary for him to know: if he would know more, let him
know that the Countess of Rossville, in her own house, and
under the protection of her mother, stands in no need either
of his advice or assistance."
“Nol that he shall never hear from me," said Gertrude,
warmly. “Mr. Lyndsay may have been duped-he shall
never be insulted under my roof, if I can prevent it.”
“Is this the language I am now to hear ?" cried Mrs. St.
Clair, passionately. "Am I so degraded by your exaltation,
that I must submit to be stigmatised-and by you? But be-
ware-Lewiston is gone, but his power remains.” Lady Ross-
ville remained silent, but tears fell from her eyes; at length
she said, “ I am no longer a child to be frightened by a bug-
bear-either tell me who this person really was, and what
power
he possessed over me, or, if you refuse to gratify me
in this, at least let his name be no more mentioned betwixt
us.-Already," cried she, giving scope to her emotion, and
speaking under its excitement—" already my feelings have
been sacrified—my reputation endangered-certainly sullied
in the eyes of one person, and yet to him you refuse that
explanation, which is due both to him and to me.”
While her daughter spoke, Mrs. St. Clair seemed to be
struggling with her passions; at length, by a violent effort,
she obtained the mastery over them, and in a feeble languid
tone, said
“ I am unable to contend with you, Gertrude; you are
mistress here, and may command, it seems, even your mother
to obey you; but, exhausted as I am by a long and dangerous
illness-my nerves shattered—my mind unstrung, you might
have spared me yet a little But why should you weep,
Lady Rossville, you who have all that this world can bestow?
Methinks you might, at least, have left tears for your mother
-poor dependant-humble as she is! Gertrude, I am in no
situation to oppose your will—with a worn-out frame-broken
spirits-depending on your bounty for my daily bread"
Accustomed, as she had all her life been to her mother's
acting, still Gertrude never could hear a reproach from her
lips without the bitterest sorrow and compunction; and, on
the present occasion, every word went as a dagger to her
heart. Her attention had artfully been led away from the
point at issue, and now she only beheld herself as the
oppressor of a mother, feeble, old, and poor.
İVith her usual impetuosity, she at once flung herself into
her mother's power, sued for forgiveness, and the scene ended,
as such scenes always did end, in Mrs. St. Clair's victory.

TIE INHERITANCE.
CHAPTER XLIII.
GERTRUDE watched with some solicitude the meeting between
her mother and Mr. Lyndsay, as she entered the drawing-
room before dinner, leaning on her arm in all the parade of
convalescence. When he came up to offer his congratulations,
her cheek was slightly suffused, and for a moment her eye
fell bencath the mild yet searching expression of his. But
quickly regaining her self-possession, she replied to his salu-
tation in that distant ceremonious manner, which plainly in-
dicated the sort of footing they were henceforth to be upon.
Mr. Lyndsay had too much tact not to feel what was implied,
and the inference he drew was, that he must now cease to
expect any explanation from her as to the past. The Earl's
death had deprived him of the only hold he had over her, for
there was no one now who had a right to interpose their
authority. Averse as he was to interference in general, yet,
upon this occasion, he considered himself called upon to act
a decided part, and he resolved to take the first opportunity
of coming to an understanding with Mrs. St. Clair on the
subject of the mysterious interviews.
Lady Rossville felt that some apology was due to her cousin,
for the introduction of so uncouth a companion as uncle
Adam; and she hastened to explain to him the cause of his
becoming her guest, and to request that he might not con-
sider him as any tax upon his politeness, or think it incum-
bent upon him to entertain a person who, she assured him,
despised entertainment in every shape.
But Lyndsay was not one of those fastidious beings, who
can only tolerate the chosen few whose endowments place
them, at least, on a level with themselves. Although the
gulf was wide which separated Mr. Ramsay and him in mind
and manners, yet he did not disdain all fellowship with him,
but welcomed the old man with that politeness which, when
it springs from benevolence, can never fail to please, and, at
the same time, with that ease and simplicity which, of all
modes of expression, are, without doubt, the most attractive.
Although quite alive to the peculiarities of his new associate,
and not a little amused with many of them, yet his better
feelings always prevailed over his sense of ridicule, and in-
stead of “giving play” to uncle Adam's foibles, he led the
conversation to such subjects as were best calculated to show
him to advantage.

It is only well-informed people who are capable of extract-
ing information from others. We require to know something
of a subject ourselves, before we can even question others to
any purpose upon it; and, perhaps, it often happens that our
own ignorance is in fault, when we throw the blame upon
other people's stupidity. Such was not Edward Lyndsay's
case ;
and
while he unconsciously displayed his own know-
ledge even in seeking information, he drew forth the hidden
stores of Mr. Ramsay, and rendered him almost an instruc-
tive and an entertaining companion.
Uncle Adam was no Othello ; but still, in the course of his
long life, he had met with his “disastrous chances,” his
“ moving accidents," his “hair-breadth 'scapes," and had
traversed many an " antre vast and desart idle ;" and though
he would have disdained anything like a regular recapitula-
tion of aught he had ever seen or met with, yet by judicious
management a great deal could be extracted from him in his
own homely manner.
Meanwhile Miss Pratt's cloven foot began to display itself
to his piercing ken. Vague notions at first floated through
his brain about her, but they were such as only wanted a
little more time and opportunity to body forth into real
shapes. He had a notion that she spoke too much-that she
took too much upon her—that she tasted of too many dif-
ferent dishes, instead of dining upon one thing, which was
one of his cardinal virtues—then, it was not her business to
press him to eat in his own niece's house, where he felt he
had a better right to eat and to speak than she had. But the
head and front of her offending was her asking him to drink
a glass of Madeira with her during dinner-that was a piece
of assurance he could not away with. In his time, it used to
be a serious and solemn thing for a gentlemen to invite a lady
to drink wine with him ; but here was a total • bouleverse-
ment' of the natural order of things, and uncle Adam actually
blushed an acceptance, as he wondered what was to come
next. To counterbalance these improprieties, she had, in the
twinkling of an eye, suited him in a pair of spectacles, which
seemed as though they had been made for him, or he for
them; she had bespoke a haggis for dinner the following
day, and undertaken to direct Monsieur Morelle in the art of
stuffing it; then she lost seven games at backgammon, for
which she paid down three and sixpence, with very evident
reluctance, too, which always serves to enhance the value of
the winnings tenfold ; so that, upon the whole, uncle Adam
was rather inclined for once to suspend his judgment, and
instead of decidedly condemning her, he merely began to
look
upon
her as a sort of doubtful character.

THE INDERITANCE.
Lady Rossville had ordered an apartment for her uncle,
communicating with the yellow turret, which contained the
goddess of his
idolatry, and which she intended should hence-
forth be his sanctum sanctorum. She, therefore, introduced
him to it the following day, but that he might feel more at
liberty to indulge his soft emotions, she was retiring, when
looking round, he called to her,-
“ But whar's the pickter you promised me?”
“ There,” said Gertrude, pointing to the Diana.
6. That !” exclaimed he, in a tone of surprise and indigna-
tion. " That Lizzie Lundie! they're no blate that evens her
to it!" And he walked round and round the turret, some-
thing in the manner of an obstreperous horse in a mill.
“This is very strange,” said Gertrude ; “ both Lord Ross-
ville and Miss Pratt seemed to know the history of this
picture so perfectly, that I never imagined there could be a
doubt about it; I am really sorry that you have been so dis-
appointed."
Disappointed !" repeated uncle Adam, stopping short,
and looking almost black with wrath, “ I'm mair than disap-
pointed—I'm perfectly disgusted !" then taking another look
_“ Lizzie Lundie was a daacent, wise-like, sensible craater
as ever lived ; and to compare her to that brazen-faced
tawpie, wi' a moon upon her head, and a great bow and arrow
in her hand !"
And again he turned away in increasing animosity against
the Diana.
“But, my dear uncle, these are merely adventitious em-
bellishments; you see she is represented in the character of
Diana-
“And what business had they to represent her as ony such
thing?"
This was a question Lady Rossville was aware she could
not answer to his satisfaction, therefore prudently waived it
by asking another.
“So, then, you don't discover any resemblance ?"
“Resemblance! Hoo is't possible there can be ony resem-
blance? Wha ever saw her in that mad-like oonnatral con-
dition, mair like a stage actress than an honest man's dochter;
you might just as weel set me up for a-a-an Apollo !"
The idea of uncle Adam, with his long cross
blue face and
pyramidical peruke, personating the God of Day, diverted
Lady Rossville so much that she laughed outright; but he
retained his inflexible severity of countenance, and seemed
quite unconscious of the ridicule of such a supposition.
Well, since you don't like the picture, you shall not be
offended by it again,” said the Countess, laying her hand

209
gently on his arm to lead him from the place ; "you shall
have another dressing-room to your apartment, and you have
only to forget the way to this one."
But uncle Adam now fixed himself opposite to the huntress
queen, and, having carefully wiped and adjusted his spec-
tacles, he contemplated her for some time without speaking;
at length, with a groan, he said,
“I'll no say but what there may be something o' a likeness
in the face, when you come to consider it—there's the brow,
the bonny brent brow _" then, kindling anew, 'but wha
e'er saw her brow wi' that senseless-like thing on the tap o't?
They could nae pent her een, to be sure, for they might as
weel hae tried to pent twa diamonds; the bit mouth's no
entirely unlike, but it has nae her bonny smile.” And uncle
Adam gazed and commented, till he gradually lost sight of
the moon and the bow, and all the offensive peculiarities of
the sylvan goddess, and at length saw only the image of his
long-loved Lizzie.
From that time the turret became his favourite haunt; and
as he was there perfectly unmolested, and was left at liberty
to follow his own devices, secure from even the interruptions
of Miss Pratt, he remained tolerably quiescent. Every day,
indeed, he made an attempt to break off, and return to his
own comfortless abode, but every day he was overruled by
Lady Rossville, whose influence over him was daily increas-
ing, although he was perfectly unconscious of it, and would
have spurned the idea of being influenced by anything but
his own free will. But there was also another inducement
for him to prolong his stay, which he would have been still
more ashamed to have acknowledged. In a paroxysm of
ennui one bad day, he had taken up the first volume of Guy
Mannering, with little expectation of deriving either amuse-
ment or instruction from it; but, once fairly entered upon it,
he found himself compelled, 'nolens volens,' to proceed, which
he did, however, in the most secret and stealthy manner.
Uncle Adam had been no novel reader even in his younger
days, and with him, as with many other excellent, but we
must suppose mistaken people, novels and mental imbecility
were ideas inseparably united in his brain. Novel writers he
had always conceived to be born idiots, and novel readers he
considered as something still lower in the scale of intellect.
It was, therefore, with feelings of the deepest humiliation ho
found himself thus irresistibly carried along on a sort of
King's-cushion, as it were, by Meg Merrilies and Dominie
Sampson. Not that he traversed the pages with the swift-
ness of a modern reader, or that he read them probably with
half the rapidity with which they were written, for he was

one of those solid substantial readers who make what they
read their own; he read and re-read, and paused and pon-
dered, and often turned back, but never looked forward,
even while experiencing the most intense anxiety as to
the result; in short, uncle Adam's whole being was com-
pletely absorbed in this (to him) new creation, while, at the
same time, he blushed even in private at his own weakness in
filling his head with such idle 'havers,' and, indeed, never
could have held it up again if he had been detected with a
volume in his hand.
CHAPTER XLIV.
The snow had now disappeared, the waters had subsided, the
air was soft for the season, the cloudy welkin had cleared up
into fleecy dappled sky, and sanguine spirits deemed that
winter was past and gone.
All must have felt what it is in this ungenial clime to part
with a fine day. It seems as though we were bidding fare-
well to some long-lost friend, and we love to watch even with
pensive regret the last rays of the softly-sinking sun, as we
would trace the lingering steps of some loved one, whom it
may be long ere we behold again.
• Fatigued as I am, still I must enjoy this lovely day to
the last,” said Lady Rossville, as they approached the Castle,
and she threw herself on a garden chair that stood upon the
lawn;
“it is one that sends such a summer feeling to the
heart,' that I feel as though I were a better being, while sit-
ting here listening to the faint notes of that sweet thrush
than I should be shut up in the drawing-room with Lady
Betty and Miss Pratt."
" It is much more agreeable at least," said Lyndsay, also
seating himself; “as to its being more amiable and virtuous,
I fear I may scarcely lay that flattering unction to my soul. I
am apt to distrust myself since-
“ Since when?" asked the Countess.
"Since I knew you, Gertrude."
This seemed rather to have burst from his lips involunta-
rily than to have been uttered deliberately; and there was
something in the tone which made Gertrude start, as a vague
suspicion darted across her mind that Lyndsay loved her.
But she had scarcely time to admit the idea ere it was as
quickly dispelled; for, when she turned to look on him, the
earnest expression with which he had been regarding her fled,
and, in a gay manner, he added

“Iflattered
myself I had been an infinitely wiser, better, and
more respectable person than I find I am, for I begin to feel
myself, under your influence, gradually sinking into a soft,
simple, neat-handed, somewhat melancholic sort of a souffre

myself with a flute and a silk dressing-gown—and then-
“ What, then ?" asked Lady Rossville, laughingly.
" Why, then, you must promise to look upon me as a very
interesting creature; and I will stand or sit half the night at
my open window playing love-lorn ditties that will cause, as
Gray says,
the
very cat to wring its hands."
“Well, I shall provide the silk dressing-gown and the
flute, but for the lady and the cat you must find these for
yourself.”
“ But these will be only a small part of the stock in hand
necessary for me to commence business with. I must be able
to write sonnets upon every occasion-often upon no occasion
at all. I must be able to take the most correct and striking
likenesses without a single sitting-
“ 'Tis time you had begun to practise that part of your
profession, certainly,” said Gertrude. “Do you remember
how long ago it is since you promised to draw my picture ?-
Pray, begin now—I have nothing else to do; and this lovely
setting sun will invest me with a little of his radiance, and
soften down all my uglinesses-see how beautiful everything
looks in its light.”
“But, you know, I warned you I never flattered in my
portraits ; mine profess to be truth severe,' cold, dry, hard
fac-similes, without a single Claud Lorraine tint."
“No matter, let me see myself such as I am, or at least
appear to my friends."
to Well, not to shock you at the very outset, I must say you
appear to me to love truth, and to be sincere in the search of
it, but you have some pride and a little obstinacy to prevent
your arriving at it; then your fancy is too lively to permit
you to take the right way, and while you are under its fan-
tastic dominion you will never judge correctly."

ing to laugh ; " is just not ugly, and is just not mad,'

pettishly, “and as I never listen to predictions that bode mo

events shall cast their shadows upon me. Come, this is
enough for one sitting, you shall have another to-morrow,
when, perhaps, you will do me such as I am, not as I may be."
“ To-morrow I must leave you," said Lyndsay.
“No, pray do not talk of leaving me," cried Gertrude
quickly ; "what will become of me when you are gone? I
shall have no one being with whom I can have any companion-
ship-no one to talk with—no one to read with no one to
sing with no one to walk with,
1-no one to teach me any
good thing—my dear cousin, say you will not leave me.”
But Lyndsay shook his head.
“ Come, Zoe,” to a little Italian greyhound that lay at her
feet, “ do you join your pretty little entreaties to mine," and
she made it assume a begging attitude. The dog was a gift
from Delmour, and Lyndsay turned away his eyes.
“I
must be gone," said he.
“Nay, rather say shall, or will be gone," cried the Coun-
tess pettishly; "I do not believe there is any must in the
matter; you are your own master, free to go or stay as you
yourself incline,"
“Even were it so, do not be so much of a spoiled child,
Gertrude, as to quarrel with your friend merely because he
has, what it is said all men have, and some women too, a will
of his own.”
“But I have more than once of late sacrificed mine to Mr.
Lyndsay's,” said Gertrude coldly.
“But were I to sacrifice my will, I must at the same time
sacrifice my conscience along with it,” said Lyndsay;
rather, to confess the truth, they are somewhat at variance
upon this occasion : the one urges me to stay, the other
warns me to be gone."
“ The conscience may be mistaken as well as the will some-
times,” said Gertrude; “in this matter I suspect yours is,
otherwise it would have told you how much good you may
do by remaining here."
“No-it never tells me such flattering tales; that is the
province of hope or fancy, and sometimes, perhaps, I may
have been weak enough to listen to their idle tales-
stopped in some emotion, and, for an instant, fixed his eyes
on Gertrude's face ; but if his words had any particular
meaning it was not caught by her, for not the slightest change

I could be of any real service to you, I would remain here
even at the sacrifice of my own ." happiness was on his
lips, but he checked himself and substituted “time; but I

know, and are now in a situation to claim it; choose, then,

Gertrude, and she instantly exclaimed, -
"Then I shall choose you for one of my guardians."
“ Choose me !" exclaimed Lyndsay, in astonishment; “no,

“ Why not? I know nobody I should like so much to
have for my guardian. I am sure you would never scold me
or lecture me, however naughty I might be-Now, don't-
pray don't propose to me any of your old cross things, with

would preach me a sermon upon every five-pound note I

“Such guardians are scarcely to be met with now, except
upon the stage," said Lyndsay, smiling.
“Perhaps the wigs and pockets—but the long faces and
lectures, I fear, prevail everywhere. I must know the
person
before I can put myself in such jeopardy."
“You may be in greater jeopardy, Gertrude," said her
cousin gravely.
Lady Rossville blushed—she saw to what he alluded ; and,
after a pause she said, in some emotion,
“ The danger which you seem to apprehend no longer
exists; the person whose audacious behaviour to me you
twice resented is no more-he has perished at sea.” And she
recapitulated the account of the shipwreck, and her mother's
testimony confirming the fate of Lewiston.
“So far, then, I shall leave you with a lightened mind,"
said Lyndsay; " there seems no more to apprehend from
that quarter at least. If there are other dangers-
But at that moment a post-chaise and four, the horses in a
foam, came driving up the avenue full speed.
“Who can this be?” exclaimed Lady Rossville : then, as
the thought flashed upon her that it might be Colonel Del-
mour, she started up-her heart beat violently—her colour
went and came—she would have moved towards the house,
but her agitation was so great she sunk upon the seat, while
her eyes remained fixed upon the carriage. It drew up at
the castle gate, and scarcely had it stopped when the person
from within burst open the door, and Colonel Delmour him-
self sprang out with such impetuosity that it was but a sin-
gle glance could be caught of him as he rushed into the
house-but that was enough. Again Gertrude rose, but,

say's, or she would have seen that he was little less agitated
than herself—she could only accept of the arm he offered
her, and in silence they proceeded together towards the
house.
As they entered the hall, the voice of one of the servants
was heard, as, in reply to an interrogatory, “Her Ladyship
has been out for some hours with Mr. Lyndsay;" and at that
instant Colonel Delmour, with a hurried step and agitated
air, rushed from the saloon. Joy, fear, doubt, displeasure,
love, a thousand mingled emotions were all struggling in
Gertrude's breast; she tried to withdraw her arm from Lynd-
say's, but she only clung the more helplessly to him, while
he felt her increasing weight, and feared she would have
fallen to the ground.
• Lady Rossville is fatigued with her walk," said he, ad-
dressing
Colonel Delmour, and mastering his own agitation at
sight of hers; "a glass of water here quickly," to the half-
dozen of servants who stood idly lounging in the hall, and
the whole instantly vanished in all the bustle and importance
of their bearing. But, mortified and ashamed of this display
of her weakness, the Countess instantly regained, in some
degree, her self-possession. Even while her heart beat high,
and her whole frame trembled with excessive emotion, she
said, with a lofty air,-
“I have to apologise to Colonel Delmour for this uncour-
teous reception on his return to-
At that moment, Lyndsay, taking the water from the ser-
vant, presented it to her himself, in the manner of one privi-
leged to render those little attentions.
“ Desire my carriage to wait,” cried Delmour, in a loud
and passionate voice, as it was driving away.
Lady Rossville was now nerved to perfect self-command,
and, with a blush of offended dignity, she passed on to the
saloon, where sat only Lady Betty, still lost in wonder at her
nephew's sudden appearance and no less sudden flight. Lynd-
say's indignation had been excited by the rudeness and vio-
lence of Colonel Delmour's address, but anger with him was
at most but a transient feeling, and a moment after they had
entered the saloon, he held out his hand to him in a friendly
manner. But the other turned hastily on his heel, and paced
the room with disordered step, utterly regardless of the ques-
tions Lady Betty continued to pour out upon him. At length
approaching Gertrude, he said, “I would speak with Lady
Rossville alone."
For a moment the Countess hesitated at the abruptness of
the demand, and her pride revolted at the manner in which

it was made ; but she rose, and with an inclination of the
head, led the way to another apartment. Colonel Delmour
followed, when, having shut the door,-
Gertrude," cried he, as he seized her hands, while his
own shook with the violence of his emotion; “now speak
my doom—from your own lips only will I hear it-say but
the word tell me I have been deceived-forgotten-for-
saken ?"
“O, no-no-never !” exclaimed Gertrude, giving way to
tears, as her resentment began to subside at sight of her
lover's anguish.
“Call it what you will then-but do not rack me by equi-
vocating: Already I have endured tortures for your sake,
that worlds would not have bribed me to undergo-despair
itself would have been a blessing, compared to these distract-
ing doubts."
* 'Tis I who have had cause to doubt," said the Countess, as
she seated herself at a table, and shaded her eyes with her
hand, ashamed of the tenderness her tears betrayed for one,
whose constancy she had such cause to question.
“ You, who have had cause to doubt!" cried Delmour im-
petuously; “could you then doubt me, Gertrude ?"
“Had I not cause ?—Why was I left at such a time, when
a single word from you-
"Would have consigned you for ever to poverty and ob-
scurity-Is it not so ? You would have been mine, had I
been base and selfish enough to have plunged you in ruin-
to have sacrificed your happiness to my own!"
“Ah! by what a degrading standard did you measure my
happiness, if you thought pomp and wealth could ever com-
pensate for broken vows-for a deceived heart ?—you would
have renounced me !"
“No, by heavens, I would not-I will not—but, yes-you
are right, I would—I will renounce you, Gertrude, if by
doing so, I can insure your happiness, it matters not though
mine be a wreck."
Lady Rossville spoke not-her heart heaved with emotion
-and Colonel Delmour leaning against the chimney-piece,
contemplated her for some moments without speaking: at
length, taking her passive hand, he seated himself on the
sofa by her, then in a voice calmed into tenderness, he said,
Gertrude, there was a time when, not had an angel spoke,
should I have believed that aught on earth could ever have
induced me to resign this hand
and even now worlds should
not wrest it from me-but, fickle-faithless as you are, why
should I seek to retain it ?"
“Release me, Colonel Delmour," cried the Countess, in a

voice choking with emotion—"I have not deserved - I will
not listen to such language," and she struggled to withdraw
her hand.
“ Yet, hear me one moment-my fate is on your lips-tell
me that our vows are cancelled, and, in doing so, seal my
doom."
But Gertrude spoke not.
“Gertrude-in spite of all-dearest-most beloved—I can-
not resign you, but with my dying breath—why do you im-
pose upon me so cruel a sacrifice ?" He unclasped the hand
in which he had held hers locked—“Why suffer your hand to
remain for an instant in mine ?-Gertrude, you are free !"
Lady Rossville slowly withdrew it, then raising her head,
she shook off the tears which gemmed her eyes, and cast on
him a look which spoke all the confiding tenderness of her
soul,—then, replacing her hand within his, she turned away
her head, to hide the blush that mantled her cheek.
CHAPTER XLV.
LYNDSAY passed the intervening time in a state of feverish
excitement very foreign to his natural equanimity of mind.
That he loved Gertrude he could no longer conceal from
himself; but his love was not of that violent yet contracted
nature, which had sought merely to engross and appropriate
her affections exclusively to himself. He had proposed a
nobler aim-a purer gratification; as his love was without
idolatry, so was it free from selfishness. He had not sought
to undermine her affections—he had aimed at elevating and
ennobling them by extending their sphere beyond the narrow,
perishable limits of human attachment; and he had hoped
that a mind so pure, so lofty, so generous as hers, might yet
become enamoured of virtue-might yet be saved from unit-
ing itself with a nature so unworthy of its love. And now
was the test; on this interview her fate seemed suspended.
Her emotion at sight of Colonel Delmour had, indeed,
evinced the power he still retained over her, but that power
might be urged too far. Though Gertrude was soft and
feminine in her feelings, yet her spirit was high, and ever
ready to rise against violence and injustice; and thus the tie,
which a tenderer hand could not have unloosed, might, by
his own impetuosity, be broken. Such were the hopes and
fears that alternately rushed over Lyndsay's heart, as he
waited, in an agony of impatience, the result of the confer-

217
ence, his eyes fixed immovably upon the door which led to
the adjoining apartment. Their usually soft benign expres-
sion had given way to dark and troubled melancholy, and
Lady Betty's questions fell unheeded on his ear. At length,
the door opened, and the first glance sufficed to show Lynd-
say that his doom and hers were sealed. Gertrude's eyes
were still moist with tears, 'tis true-but there was a smile on
her lip--a flush of joy on her cheek-a lightness in her step
--an aërial grace diffused over her whole face and figure—that
told a tale of reconciled love, and seemed as though Happi-
ness itself were embodied in a mortal form. All had been
explained, and explanations were received as proofs of holy
writ, for what imperfect evidence suffices where the heart is
willing to believe! Colonel Delmour told a tale of suffering
-he told of the agonising alternative that had been offered
to him to make her his, and, in doing so, to make her, at the
same time, an outcast from the home of her fathers—to re-
duce her to poverty and want: he told her of the struggles of
his mind-of the menacing fears—the half-formed resolutions
--the desperate thoughts which had harassed his fancy, and
destroyed his peace by day-the horrid dreams—the agonis-
ing forms which had haunted his couch by night-till at
length nature sunk under the conflict, and a violent fever en-
sued. No sooner was he sufficiently recovered to encounter
the voyage, than, unable longer to endure this state of sus-
pense, and yet still more unable to come to any decision until
he had seen her, he formed the resolution of returning to
Britain, be the consequences what they might, of sounding
the depths of her affection, and of receiving his sentence from
her own lips. The voyage proved tedious and hazardous,
and, on landing, he proceeded direct to London. He had
there heard, for the first time, of the death of Lord Ross-
ville ; and his brother, at the same time, made known to him
his rejection by the Countess, and the fact, that her marriage
with Ēdward Lyndsay was a settled point, and was to take
place as soon as propriety admitted. Almost maddened at
this intelligence, he had thrown himself into a post-chaise,
and travelled night and day till he had arrived there, when
his worst fears were confirmed by the answer he received to
his inquiry for her, as well as from the footing she appeared
to be upon with Lyndsay.
This was Colonel Delmour's way of telling his own story,
and it was correct in everything save the motives.
6. What's
done we fairly may compute," but who can trace actions to
their source? who can fathom the depths of the human heart,
or discern those secret springs, which, although they send
forth waters alike pure to the eye, are yet as the issues of

THE INHERITANCE.
life and death ? Colonel Delmour had told a tale, which in
every circumstance was true, and yet the colouring was false.
He had ascribed to disinterested affection what, in reality,
proceeded from self-interest : for although he assuredly did
love, it was love compounded of such base materials as ad-
versity, like the touch of Ithuriel's spear, would soon have
shivered to atoms. But she saw nothing of all this, and she
gave her tears— her faith-her love to him, whom she
thought more than worthy of them all. His looks too seemed
to confirm his words, for he looked thin, and pale, and
harassed; but as the cloud cleared away from his brow, and
the traces of passion, which had disfigured his fine features,
disappeared, that gave him an interest in her eyes, which
more than atoned for the want of more dazzling attributes.
On her part, Gertrude could also have told much, but 'tis
woman's part to suffer, man's privilege to speak on those oc-
casions, and while Colonel Delmour poured forth the history
of his feelings in all the eloquence of excitement, it was plain
to see that he touched an answering chord in her heart, and
that she too had endured all that he expressed. But, now
that the storm was passed, the sunshine of the soul was
theirs, only varied according to the different natures from
which it emanated ; and as Lyndsay beheld the April-like
joy that beamed in Gertrude's face, and met the haughty ex-
ulting glance at Delmour, he, for a moment, closed his eyes,
as though he could also have closed his heart against the con-
viction, that Gertrude was lost to him-lost to the higher,
happier destiny, that he had fondly traced out for her.
“What's taking you away in such a hurry, Frederick ?"
asked Lady Betty, laying down her book and her spectacles
on their entrance.
“I only came in haste, and have no intention of returning
the same way," answered he with a smile of meaning to the
Countess, then ringing the bell, he gave orders to discharge
his carriage.
“Where did you come from to-day?" was Lady Betty's
second interrogatory.
"That I really cannot tell, having travelled day and night
since I landed at Falmouth; their boundaries are not very
accurately defined in my mind, or my mind's
eye
either."
“What was the need of that?" demanded her Ladyship.
“ Had you heard of your good uncle's death ?"
“ In London, where I only stopped half an hour."
“ Did you see your brother ? Did he tell you that he had
given up the election ? Did your mother and sisters tell you
that ?"
“I did-he didthey did - let us have done."

"And what was the nonsense of your posting down then?”
"To put a stop to absurd pretensions,” answered Colonel
Delmour with a sort of insolent nonchalance, as he looked at
Mr. Lyndsay.
“But do you think you'll succeed ?"
Colonel Delmour smiled a smile of haughty disdain, Lady
Rossville coloured, and Lyndsay, looking steadily at him,
said calmly-
“I have heard of no absurd pretensions-none who had
not, at least, an equal right to try their merits if they had
thought proper.
Ere Colonel Delmour could utter the scornful retort which
had risen to his lips, the door opened, and uncle Adam walk-
ed in, with his antique peruke, and blue-boot hose—for he
had now got so tame, that he had learnt to walk the house at
all hours of the day. He was not aware of the arrival of a
stranger, otherwise he would certainly have skulked till the
last moment–if, indeed, he would not actually have fled the
country to his own city of refuge in Barnford.
Colonel Delmour surveyed him for a moment from head to
foot with unfeigned astonishment, when Lady Rossville in-
troduced him as her uncle, Mr. Ramsay. He then, quickly
recovering himself, saluted him with a bow, twice repeated,
so condescendingly profound, and with such an air of high
breeding, as formed a ludicrous contrast to uncle Adam's
awkward, repulsive gait, and dry uncouth manner. The
latter possessed too much tact not to feel what was implied,
and that such lofty courtesy only betokened one, "proud
enough to be humble," and a new stock of wrath began to
ferment within him, that on hand having previously been
disposed of at the expense of Dame Lowrie's dead-clothes.
For the first time, Lady Rossville blushed for her relation.
Colonel Delmour absolutely, stared, and that was a great
deal for a man like Colonel Delmour to do. Lady Rossville,
covered with confusion, tried to laugh, but the thought that
Colonel Delmour was shocked with her uncle made it rather
a difficult matter. Luckily, at that moment, her servant
entered to say that Mrs. St. Clair had returned from her
airing, and begged to see her Ladyship immediately.
CHAPTER XLVI.
6. What is this I hear ?" was the exclamation that greeted
Gertrude on her entrance. “Is it possible that Colonel
Delmour has had the effrontery to come to this house? Is it

credible that you have had the weakness to receive him under
your roof after what has passed ?”.
“I know nothing that ought to render Colonel Del-
mour an unsuitable or an unwelcome guest in my house,”
answered the Countess, endeavouring to speak calmly and
decidedly.
“Then you do not know that as the poor, dependent Ger-
trude St. Clair, he slighted, disowned, and in a manner re-
jected you; and that now, as Countess of Rossville, he flies
to you, worships you, would marry you? Is it not so, and
did I not foretell how it would be ?"
" While we view Colonel Delmour's conduct in such dif-
ferent lights, 'tis impossible we should agree. Mamma, I
beseech you, say no more. I am satisfied completely
perfectly satisfied, that he has acted all along from the noblest
and most disinterested motives."
“How has he proved that? Who is there credulous
enough to believe his averments of disinterested affection ?
Why should they be believed ? What right has he to expect
such monstrous credulity ?"
“ The right which every generous mind feels it has upon
the faith and confidence of another."
“Gertrude, your words are those of a child—I may say, of
a fool. Who else could be weak enough to credit assertions
contradicted by the whole tenor of the man's conduct ?"
“Be it so then !" cried Lady Rossville, vainly struggling to
retain her composure ; “I am a child—a fool, for I believe
in Colonel Delmour's truth and honour. The prejudices of
the whole world would not shake my conviction.”
“And what are to be the consequences of your madness ?
Will you dare to brave my authority, and marry him against
my consent ?" cried Mrs. St. Clair, giving way to one of her
transports of passion. Lady Rossville remained silent.
“Speak, I desire you," continued she, with increasing impe-
tuosity; “I repeat, will you dare to marry him against my
consent ?"
“Mamma, I have twice solemnly passed my word to you,
that I will not marry until I have attained the age of twenty-
one."
“If you would have me to trust to that, then, till that
period arrives, dismiss your lover—this very day let Colonel
Delmour leave your house, and leave you free :-consent to
that, and I will believe you sincere."
“ Impossible !” exclaimed the Countess in agitation.-
“How can you require of me to act in such a manner?"
" Then leave it to me. I am the fittest person to act for
you in this matter. I will see Colonel Delmour myself;"

221
and she was moving towards the door, when Gertrude laid
her hand upon her arm, and, with a cheek coloured with re-
sentment, exclaimed “If my friends are to be turned
from under my roof, then is my own house no longer a
habitation for me. I will seek another home-other pro-
tection."
Mrs. St. Clair turned pale with passion, and, in a voice
almost suffocated, she said—“In the meantime, I command
you, by the duty you owe me, to confine yourself to your
own apartment for the present. Do not think to brave my
power-I still possess it, and will use it."
There are bounds, beyond which passion cannot go, with-
out counteracting its own purpose ; and Mrs. St. Clair had
scarcely uttered the words, when she was sensible she had
gone too far to be obeyed. Lady Rossville instantly became
calm, but it was not the calm of fear or of submission, but
that of settled determination, as she bent her head in silent
acquiescence, and, without uttering a syllable, was about to
withdraw.
Stay-where-what do you mean?” cried her mother,
interrupting her in her progress to the door.
" To obey,” answered Lady Rossville, calmly.
“Gertrude, why-why do you drive me to such extremi-
ties?"
“ 'Tis I who am driven to extremities, God help me !" ex-
claimed her daughter, bursting into tears.
“Gertrude, what is your meaning-what is your purpose ?”
cried her mother, in violent agitation.
Lady Rossville was silent for a few moments. The question
was repeated, when, after a struggle to regain her composure,
she said "This house, and all that I call mine, is yours to
command; but my affections, my liberty, will brook no
control. For this day I submit to be a prisoner in my own
house-to-morrow I will place myself under the protection
of the laws of my country-from these I shall surely meet
with justice-let these appoint guardians for me."
Mrs. St. Clair was struck with consternation. She felt the
error she had committed, in goading to the utmost a spirit
such as her daughter's; and there remained but one way to
extricate herself from the dilemma she had brought herself
into by her violence; true, that was the old way, but it had
hitherto succeeded, and might still answer the purpose better
than
any
other.
“No, Gertrude," cried she, “ since it is your wish that we
should part, it is for me to seek another home. Suffer me to
remain here for this night, and to-morrow you shall be rid
of me for ever. I feel I can neither contribute to your

greatness nor your happiness; but all that I would lay claim
to-peace of mind and respectability—are in your hands.
Spare me, at least, the misery and disgrace of being de-
nounced to the world by one for whom I have done and
suffered so much l" and Mrs. St. Clair wept real, genuine
tears.
But at that moment Mrs. St. Clair's maid tapped at the
door, to inform her lady that dinner was upon the table; and,
at the same moment, the gong sounded, in confirmation
of the intelligence. In an instant all high-wrought feeling
was put to flight by this vulgar, every-day occurrence.
“Good heavens !” exclaimed she, aware that her elaborate
toilette required at least an hour to arrange—“What is to
be done ?—How came we to miss the dressing bell ?—It is
impossible for me to appear; and both to be absent would
have a strange appearance. Gertrude, you must join the
company; do make haste.' Then, as her daughter stood
irresolute" As you love me, obey me now. Let there be
mutual forgiveness-mutual confidence. Away, my love ;"
and she kissed her forehead. To avoid farther contention,
Gertrude hastened to her apartment to dress, and recover
her composure as she best could.
CHAPTER XLVII.
MRS. ST. CLAIR's generalship was exerted so successfully
throughout the evening, that, without any apparent design, the
lovers were effectually precluded from exchanging words with
each other, except in the way of common conversation. But
this could not always continue; she felt she had committed her-
self with her daughter, and must now either act with decision
and authority, or give up the attempt altogether. The first
would be a dangerous experiment with one of the Countess's
high spirit, and the other was too galling an alternative to be
voluntarily embraced. Sooner or later she saw it must end
in guardians being appointed for her daughter, and she
therefore determined to put the best face she could upon it,
and be the first to propose the measure herself; not without
hopes that, while she thus appeared to throw up the reins,
she might at the same time be enabled the more effectually
to strengthen her own hands. When the party broke up for
the night, she took Lady Rossville's arm and led her to her
own dressing-room, when, dismissing her attendant, she thus
began :-"Gertrude, as this is perhaps the last time I may

have an opportunity of addressing you under your own
roof-
“Oh, mamma!” exclaimed the Countess, seizing her mo-
ther's hand, “ do not, I beseech you, do not recur to what
has passed on that subject! This house is yours-you must
not leave it I will not leave you-
“ Gertrude, be calm, and hear me
“No, mamma, first hear me declare, that all remonstrance
will prove unavailing—that no earthly consideration ever can
change my resolution-I will not renounce my own free
choice."
Lady Rossville spoke slowly, and she pronounced the last
words in a manner which showed that opposition would in-
deed be vain.
“My object is not to contend with you, Gertrude," said her
mother, with a sigh: “ for I am fully aware how little influ-
ence I now possess over you; but my wish is to see you
placed under the protection and guardianship of those, who,
if they want a mother's love, may soon possess more than a
mother's influence.-Say who it is that you would choose
for your guardian."
“I choose you, mamma, for one, and my cousin Lyndsay for
another; if a third is necessary, do you and he appoint whom
you please.”
Mrs. St. Clair was thunderstruck at the promptitude and
decision of this answer, and she could only repeat, in a tone
of amazement-
“Mr. Lyndsay your guardian! What an idea!"
“Surely there is nothing wrong in it, mamma ?--and who
else could I name?"
“It certainly is not customary to choose so very young a
man for such an office."
“But Mr. Lyndsay knows how I am situated— I consider
myself as having been repeatedly obliged to him beyond the
possibility of my ever repaying him, and although on one
point we certainly differ,"Gertrude blushed as she spoke,
16 yet that does not prevent my doing justice to his general
character. I respect and esteem him as my friend -as the
person who has twice saved me from insult, once from de-
struction; and I would fain prove to him, in perhaps the
only way I may ever have in my power, the reliance I have
on him, by placing myself under his control. After the
scenes he has witnessed, I owe it to myself to make Edward
Lyndsay my guardian."
Mrs. St. Clair was silent for some time, while, in her own
mind, she balanced the pros and cons of this measure.
In
the first place, she disliked the thought of having to deal with

& person of Edward Lyndsay's acute understanding, unbend-
ing principle, and high standard of rectitude; one who, be-
sides, already knew too much of her private concerns, and
consequently, could not be impressed with a very favourable
idea of her character. But, to balance these drawbacks, he
was evidently no friend to Colonel Delmour, and she thought
she might safely calculate on his assistance to further any
scheme to preserve Gertrude from becoming the dupe of his
artifices. She was aware that he took more than a common
interest in her daughter, and she had no doubt but she would
so manage, as by that means to gain an ascendancy over him,
while she had little fear that he would ever succeed in sup-
planting his rival; she would be on her guard against that,
and, at any rate, it was worth running all risks to detach her
from her present entanglement. Still, even in this view, it
was a bitter pill to swallow, and she remained thoughtful and
disconcerted. At last she said, “You talk of repaying your
obligations to Lyndsay, as though it were a benefit you were
about to confer on him, by choosing him for your guardian.
Are you aware that it is an office attended with much trouble
and responsibility, and that you will only be adding to the
weight of that mighty debt you have already incurred ?"
My cousin, I know, will not consider it in that light;
and, even if he should, I would rather be indebted to him
than any one else."
“Yet there are others on whom you have at least equal
claims, and whom the world might think rather more suitable
guardians for you."
"I do not know to whom you allude, mamma."
" It is not for me to point them out to you," said Mrs. St.
Clair, with affected dignity.
"If you mean my uncle Adam, he is out of the question ;
he is so odd-
“I do not mean my uncle,” interrupted her mother; “you
have still nearer relatives."
Lady Rossville coloured at the thoughts of Mr. Alexander
Black. There was a good-humoured, vulgar familiarity about
him she could scarcely brook, and to subject herself to it was
more than her proud spirit could submit to. She made no reply.
“There is also another person, whom I have less scruple in
naming to you; and either, or both of those, I believe, the
world in general would deem perfectly unexceptionable
in point of station, connection, character, experience, pro-
perty-in short, all the essentials for such a trust: neither
of them certainly are Werters or St. Preux, but they are
both what I think fitter for the purpose—they are both men
of unblemished character, respectable understandings, mature

age, and good, if not great families; but to one or both of
these add, if you choose, any third party, such as Lord
Millbank, Sir Peter Wellwood, Lord Fairacre, all of them
you have seen and know something of, and one of them
joined either with Mr. Black or Major Waddell-
“Major Waddell !” exclaimed the Countess ; surely,
mamma, you are not serious ? Major Waddell my guar-
dian! No, that is too, really too degrading."
“ You assume a vast deal too much with your new digni-
ties,” said Mrs. St. Clair, warmly, “when you presume
to talk in that strain of a man born and bred a gentleman,
and connected, too, with the first families in the county. The
time may come when you may know what degradation is, and
much as you despise my family, you may yet-
But no
more of this folly. I have named to you no less than five
individuals, each and all of whom I consider perfectly un-
exceptionable in every respect."
“Well, then, if I must be so guarded, let Mr. Lyndsay
and you raise a whole regiment of guards if you will-with
the 'exception of Major Waddell-everything else I leave
to you and my cousin.” Lady Rossville laid particular
emphasis on the word cousin.
" And now, mamma, pray
dismiss me; I am dying of sleep."
“And I of care," said her mother, with a deep sigh.
“Do not say so, mamma; be assured we shall both be
happy in our own way;" and kissing her, Gertrude withdrew
to her own apartment.
The following morning Mrs. St. Clair sent, at an early
hour, to desire Lady Rossville to attend her in her dressing-
room; and Gertrude was surprised, upon obeying the sum-
mons, to find her mother already up and dressed, as, ever
since Lord Rossville's death, she had indulged in late hours,
and secluded herself in her own apartment during the greater
part of the day.
“I wish to know, Gertrude," said she, in a solemn manner,
" whether you still retain the same sentiments that you pro-
fessed last night? Is it still your determination to throw off
the parental yoke, to publish your distrust of your mother ?"
“It is still my determination," answered the Countess,
gravely, “to obey my mother in all things compatible with
what is due to myself; and I proclaim my sentiments to the
world when I voluntarily make choice of her as my guardian.
The other must be Edward Lyndsay." Lady Rossville spoke
even more firmly than she had done the preceding night; and
Mrs. St. Clair found that all attempts to turn her from this
resolution would prove abortive.
“Be it so, then !" cried she ; "anything must be better

than this state of things. Give me your arm. I mean to
breakfast below to-day," and they descended together to the
breakfast-room, where only uncle Adam and Miss Pratt had
just appeared. These two worthies were in the heat of a
colloquy, but on the entrance of the ladies, it suddenly
ceased in a very abrupt and suspicious manner, and uncle
Adam shuffled away to the window with ears pendent, while
Miss Pratt, who at first was quite thrown on her beam-ends,
began to rally her forces.
The mystery was simply the result of a wager of five
guineas, that Lyndsay would marry Lady Rossville; renewed,
not without hopes on Pratt's side, of persuading uncle Adam
to knock under at once upon the voluminous mass of evidence
she was pouring out upon him, and which she flattered her-
self would finally terminate in her fingering the five guineas,
as she already looked upon them as her own, and felt some-
what impatient at being kept out of her lawful property.
They had, however, all the air of detected lovers, and Mrs.
St. Clair's antipathy against Miss Pratt was increased tenfold,
as the idea flashed upon her, that she was endeavouring
to inveigle uncle Adam and his seventy thousand pounds into
an alliance, offensive in the highest degree. However, their
loves were a secondary consideration at present, and she
allowed them to pass unnoticed in the virtuous intention of
crushing them effectually at some future period.
Breakfast passed very heavily. There was an evident
constraint on all present; for even Miss Pratt was more
intent on watching the progress of her wager, than in dis-
pensing the usual flow of chit-chat. Mrs.
St. Clair main-
tained the same haughty reserve towards Colonel Delmour,
which he either was, or affected to ap pear quite unconscious
of, and directed his looks and at tentions solely to Lady
Rossville. But Miss Pratt's abst raction seldom lasted long,
and as she chanced to cast her eye on Lyndsay, she suddenly
exclaimed, “Bless my heart, my dear! what makes you
look
so ill to-day?"
“I was not aware that I was looking particularly ugly this
this morning," answered he.
“ Ugly, my dear! that's a very strong word. As Anthony
Whyte says, it's one thing to look ill, and another thing to
look ugly, and that there's many a one it would be paying too
high a compliment to, to tell them they were looking ill, for
that would imply that they sometimes looked well-so you
see you ought to be much flattered by my telling you
that you are looking ill. Don't you think so, Lady Ross-
ville ?
“I suspect Mr. Lyndsay is not easily flattered," answered

227
she. “I
was trying my powers with him in that way yester-
day, but I cannot flatter myself I was successful.”
“A fair acknowledgment that you were only flattering me
all the while," said he, forcing a smile ; “I half suspected as
much, and, therefore, to punish you for your insincerity,
I shall certainly remain where I am for this day at least."
"I suspect that will prove rather an encouragement than a
corrective of the vice," said Mrs. St. Clair, gaily ; 66 and lest
Mr. Lyndsay should next mistake the matter, so far as to
think of rewarding our plain-dealing by running away from
us, I engage him to attend me now to the library."
Mr. Lyndsay bowed his acquiescence, not without some
surprise, and, as he rose, Mrs. St. Clair put her arm within
his, and was leaving the room, when, as if recollecting some-
thing, she called her daughter to her, and contrived to con-
verse her out of the room, and to lead her through the suite
of apartments, till they came to that adjoining the library.
“Wait here, my love, for a few minutes," said she ; “I
would first speak with Mr. Lyndsay alone, but it will be
necessary you should join us immediately.”
Lady Rossville felt as if she had only been taken there to
be away from Colonel Delmour, and she almost smiled in
derision at her mother's petty stratagems.
“Now !" cried Miss Pratt, in an exulting tone to uncle
Adam, as the party left the room.
6 Weel-what noo?" demanded he, in an undaunted tone.
“ That's really speaking out,” continued she, pointing after
them, and, at the same time, casting a glance at Colonel Del-
mour, who had hitherto sat in a sort of bitter scornful silence,
but, on finding himself left at table with such a group as
uncle Adam, Lady Betty, and Miss Pratt, he had immediately
risen, and, after carelessly tossing some fragments of the
breakfast to his dog, and whistling a French air to him, he
sauntered away with his usual air of high-bred nonchalance.
“ Sour grapes,” whispered Miss Pratt to uncle Adam.
“ I'm no very sure about that,” was the reply, as he pre-
pared to creep away to his turret to Lizzie Lundie and Meg
Merrilies.
CHAPTER XLVIII.
MRS. ST. CLAIR'S nerves almost failed her when she found
herself alone with Lyndsay for the first time since their
meeting in the wood; but then the reflection that the secret
connected with that scene was for ever buried in the deep (or,

what was still deeper, her own heart) recalled her self-posses-
sion, and, without betraying any fear or hesitation, she
began,-
* It must doubtless appear extraordinary to you that I
should have allowed so much time to elapse without giving
you the "éclaircissement' which you must naturally have
expected."
to Which I was promised," said Lyndsay emphatically.
" True, you were so ; but my own illness, the subsequent
events which have taken place in the family, rendered the
performance of such a promise, for a time, impracticable ;
since then it has become unnecessary. The person who was
the cause of so much needless alarm to my daughter and
myselí is no more ; he has perished at sea--you must have ob-
served in a late newspaper the detail of the shipwreck, and
probably drew from it the same conclusion that the wrong-
headed'infatuated man who had caused us so much annoy-
ance had met his fate."
“Yes, so far I did conjecture, but the circumstances which
seemed to have placed Lady Rossville and you so completely
in the power of such a man-you surely do not mean to leave
these to conjecture ?”
“It is certainly not every one on whose candour, and libe-
rality, and charity, I could place such reliance as to leave a
shadow of doubt on their minds which it was in my power to
clear
away; but when I balance, on the one hand, the painful
task I should have to perform in recurring to past events—in
disturbing the ashes of the departed, in harrowing up my
own feelings, by recalling the unmerited obloquy, the po-
verty, and privations, my unfortunate husband was doomed to
endure in consequence of his ill-fated attachment to me-can
I-ought mine to be the hand to tear aside the veil in which
his errors are now for ever shrouded ? On the other, what
have I to dread from a nature so honourable and candid as
yours, one which I believe to be as incapable of suspecting
evil as of committing it ?"
“I fear you give me credit for an extent of virtue I do not
possess,” said Lyndsay gravely; "for I must freely confess
that I have received impressions of so unfavourable a nature
that I find all my charity quite insufficient to dispel them.
Surely, then, justice is due to the living as well as tenderness
to the dead."
“You say true, and rather than that my daughter should
suffer in your estimation,” – Mrs. St. Clair stopped and
sighed. “Yet I flattered myself that, with the thousand
opportunities I have lately afforded you of gaining a tho-
rough insight into her character, and of witnessing the al-

"
most childish openness of her disposition, you would, ere
now, have been enabled, from your own knowledge of her
(an infinitely surer criterion than a mother's commendation),
to have acquitted her of all culpability in this unfortunate
occurrence, ambiguous as it may appear."
‘My suspicions do not, in the least degree, attach to Lady
Rossville," cried Lyndsay warmly; "I could stake my life
on the purity of her mind and conduct-but-
“ But you distrust me. Well, be it so; since my daugh-
ter does not suffer I am satisfied. Let mine be the obloquy,
only let me screen from reproach the memory of a husband."
"I am little used to disguise my sentiments,” said Lynd-
say; " and the present occasion I think warrants my express-
ing them very plainly. You must excuse me, then, when I
say that I can scarcely conceive any motive so powerful as to
induce a mother to endanger her own and her daughter's
reputation. I have twice seen Lady Rossville insulted—had
I possessed the power she should certainly have been under
other protection before now."
Mrs. St. Clair struggled for some moments to retain her
composure—but she succeeded, and resumed,
“I was aware that such must be your opinion, and, morti-
fying as it is, I shall make no attempt to change it at present.
Hereafter, perhaps, you may do me greater justice ; in the
meantime it is my determination to resign the guardianship of
my daughter into other hands. It is my wish, and that of
Lady Rossville, that Mr. Lyndsay would accept this trust-
the strongest proof we can either of us give of our own self-
respect, as well as our confidence and esteem for him."
Mr. Lyndsay's emotion at this proposal did not escape
Mrs. St. Clair's piercing observation, and she secretly hoped
he might decline the proposal, but, after a few minutes' consi-
deration, he said,
“I accept of the trust, and hope I may be enabled to dis-
charge it faithfully, but I cannot take the whole responsibility
of such an office; there must be other guardians appointed.”
“My daughter insists upon my acting also in that capa-
city, although it was my wish to have delegated the office
entirely to others—to my brother, for instance, or my
nephew, Major Waddell, or any other of the county gentle-
men she would name; but she is immovable on that point-
80 we have only to consider hereafter who it will be proper
to make choice of. Meanwhile, allow me to consider you as
the actual guardian of my Laughter, and as such anxious to
co-operate with me in all that is for her advantage;" and Mrs.
St. Clair went over pretty much the same ground she had

done before, in painting the anticipated miseries of her union
with Colonel Delmour-aggravated, too, by his late evasive
conduct—the whole concluding with, “Had his absence been
prolonged but for a tew months this childish fancy would have
passed away, a more rational and more enduring attachment
would have taken its place. Already I sometimes flattered
myself the work was begun;" and she sighed as she fixed her
eyes on Lyndsay, whose changing expression and varying
colour spoke the feelings he would not for worlds have ut-
tered. * And now what is to be done? Separated they
must be, and that without delay, for while they are suffered
to remain together, his influence will prevail over every other.
Already his ascendancy is obvious-every day, every hour,
spent together, will only serve to strengthen it. My autho-
rity singly will be of no avail to counteract it, but you pos-
sess weight and influence with Gertrude-
66 Which I have neither the right nor the inclination to use
at present. Rashness and violence can serve no purpose but
to increase opposition. Rely upon Lady Rossville's promise
not to marry
," and Lyndsay's voice faltered a little as he said
it, “till she is of age. In the meantime treat her with open-
ness and confidence: these will prove firmer holds than
bolts or bars with a nature such as hers--suffer her mind to
expand, and her judgment to mature-suffer the slow but
gradual process of mental elucidation to go on-let her see
others perhaps as gifted as Colonel Delmour, and leave her
free to form her own opinions, and draw her own conclusions
-perhaps, when she knows him better she will learn to
value him less, but any attempt to force a mind such as hers
against its own bent will never succeed. You may gall and
fret her temper, but you will not change, or at least improve
her nature, and I never will consent to any measures of the
kind."
This was very contrary to what Mrs. St. Clair had antici-
pated. She had flattered herself that he would have caught
eagerly at the bait thrown out, and would have been ready
to assist her in any scheme she might have suggested for the
separation of the lovers. But Lyndsay's mind was much too
noble and generous to allow any selfish considerations for a
moment to sway him even where the temptation was most
powerful. He had no base passions to gratify, neither envy,
nor jealousy, nor revere, and, consequently, his decisions
were always just and upright. But it was far otherwise with
Mrs. St. Clair, and she was provoked and disappointed at
having failed to stimulate him to co-operate with her in the
violent measures she had projected. She was aware, how-

231
ever, that it would be in vain to oppose the Countess and him
together, and she was, therefore, obliged to yield an unwilling
assent for the present.
Lady Rossville was now summoned to the conference, and
the result was, that Lord Millbank and Mr. Alexander Black
should be requested to accept the office of joint guardians
along with Mrs. St. Clair and Mr. Lyndsay.
“ As there are now no secrets amongst us, Gertrude," said
her mother, in her most ostentatious manner, waving her
hand to Mr. Lyndsay; "I may inform you, that it has been
agreed upon by Mr. Lyndsay and myself, that Delmour shall
be permitted to remain here for the present on the footing of
any other guest; such is the confidence we both place in your
good sense and propriety."
Lady Rossville blushed to the forehead at this extraordi-
nary address, and both Lyndsay and she turned away their
eyes
from each other.
" It would be a strange assumption of brief authority in
me," said he, “were I to presume to interfere with Lady
Rossville in the choice of her guests ;" and with a slight incli-
nation of the head, he quitted the room.
" What a load has been taken from my mind by this ar-
rangement;" said Mrs. St. Clair, with a sigh, which rather
belied her words ; " and now, Gertrude, love, will you order
the carriage, or shall I? We must pay some visits—in par-
ticular, we must go to my brother's. "Mr. Lyndsay has pro-
mised to ride to Lord Millbank's this morning, and settle mat-
ters with him. He is a stupid man, but it seems he is a
relation of yours, and understands business, so he may do
very well. As for your uncle, 'tis proper you should see
him yourself. I don't think you have been at Bellevue since
Lord Rossville's death."
“ But this morning is so delightful, it would be a sin to
waste it on a dull drive to Bellevue ; a much worse one might
serve equally well for that purpose, and there are a thousand
things I have to do to-day-I must see what progress has
been made with my rustic bridge—whether the terrace-walk
has yet been begun-how speeds my bower—if my flower
knots are arranging according to rule—apropos, mamma,
what a lack of shrubs and flowers are here! I must have
quantities immediately; not a day must be lost. I must have
clouds of dropping roses to meet this ethereal mildness,' and
do all honour to this gentlest of gentle springs."
" Don't be a fool, Gertrude: or, at least, remember there
is a time for all things, even for folly. The present belongs
to more important subjects than building baby-houses, and
dressing dolls."

THE INHERITANCE.
Well, mamma, pray manage them as you will, but leave
me at liberty to have a walk to-day."
“And who, pray, is to be your escort in this important sur-
vey y?"
Lady Rossville blushed and hesitated, then, in a faint
voice, said, “ Anybody, mamma."
“But Lady Rossville is not to ramble all over the country
with anybody or everybody," said her mother sarcastically;
“I will have no clandestine meetings, remember."
“ Clandestine !” repeated the Countess, “no; with my
own guests and relations, why should I have recourse to clan-
destine measures? My intention was to walk with Colonel
Delmour; but since it is your desire that I should accompany
you, I will do so ;” and she rose to ring the bell and order
the carriage, when the movement was arrested by hearing
the sound of wheels crisping the gravel, as they rolled slowly
round to the grand entrance. “Ah! there are my aunts !”
exclaimed Lady Rossville. “I wrote yesterday to invite
them, but I scarcely looked for them so soon. I must fly to
welcome them;" and in an instant she was on the outer steps
of the entrance, ready to assist her aunt Mary herself.
CHAPTER XLIX.
But the carriage door being opened, there stepped out Major
Waddell, having upon his back a vast military cloak, with all
its various appliances of tags, and jags, and flags, and waving
capes, and scarlet linings, and shining brooch, &c., &c., &c.
The Major having placed himself on one side of the carriage-
door, black Cæsar, in no less gorgeous array, stationed him-
self at the other, and then, after a little feminine delay, there
came forth Mrs. Major Waddell in all her bravery. A rich
and voluminous satin mantle enveloped her person; a rare
and costly lace veil streamed like a meteor to the wind; muff,
bonnet, feathers, boots, reticule-all were in perfect keeping;
and Mrs. Major Waddell, from the crown of the head to the
sole of the foot, might have stood for the frontispiece of 'La
Belle Assemblée.'
Placing a hand upon each of her supporters, she descended
the steps
of the carriage with much deliberate dignity, and
then, as if oppressed with the weight of her own magnificence
she gave her muff to Cæsar, while the Major gallantly seized
her reticule, and assisted her to ascend the flight of steps,
where stood the Countess, provoked at herself for her pre-

cipitation in having so unwarily rushed out to receive this
unexpected importation.
Well, cousin, this is really kind !" exclaimed Mrs. Major;
“but you see what it is to be without a lord and master.
Here is mine would be in perfect agonies if I were to stand
for a single moment outside the door without
my
bonnet.”
“You ought to tell Lady Rossville, at the same time, who
it was tied two double neckcloths round my throat yesterday,
when-
But Lady Rossville could not listen to the Major's playful
recrimination, and she interrupted him by saying, with a some-
what stately air,
“I imagined it was my aunt Mary who had arrived, and,
knowing how helpless she is, I hastened out to see that she
was properly attended to. But my friends are all welcome,'
added she, with her usual sweetness of manner, and she led
the way to the saloon.
Mrs. Waddell was a prize to Lady Betty and Miss Pratt,
who were both fond of seeing fine-dressed people; and Mrs.
Waddell had so much to look at, and her things were all so
new, and so rich, and so fashionable; and India muslin, and
India shawls, and India chains, and lace, and trinkets, were
heaped upon her with such an unsparing hand, that it was
quite a feast to sit and scan each article individually. Miss
Pratt even went farther, and anticipated, at the least, half a
piece of sprigged India muslin to herself, the same as Mrs.
Waddell's gown, which she forthwith began to admire with
all her might. Moreover, she intended to ingratiate herself
so far as to obtain a footing in the house, for, as she reasoned
with herself, there was nobody knew good living better than
your nabobs; they were commonly squeamish and bilious,
and needed a nice bit; and, at any rate, one might depend
upon genuine Mullagatawney and Madeira at their tables, and,
to a used stomach, these were great restoratives, for a fort-
night or so, now and then. Miss Pratt, thereupon, began to
do the honours with even more than her usual activity. She
made a point of taking off Mrs. Waddell's mantle with her
own hands, commenting upon its beauty as she did so; she
insisted upon her using a footstool, and having two additional
squab-cushions to lean upon, and pressed a cup of chocolate,
in a manner not to be withstood. She was obliged to give
back a little, however, when Mrs. St. Clair came sweeping in
with her usual authoritative air, and welcomed her relations
with a patronising grandeur of deportment, that sunk Miss
Pratt's nimble civilities into nothing.
Mrs. St. Clair was vulgar enough to feel gratified by the
appearance made by her piece. He equipage was handsome

we are,
-her dress fashionable and expensive-she herself very
pretty; the Major's rank was respectable-his connections
were good; and though they were both fools, yet a fool in
satin was a very different thing from a fool in sackcloth, and
was treated accordingly. She therefore began, “ I observe
your carriage has not been put up, Isabella ; surely Major
Waddell and you have not come so far as to pay us a mere
morning visit? Gertrude, you must endeavour to persuade
your cousins
“The best of all persuasions," said Miss Pratt, “is to order
the horses to be put up; that's a sure argument is it not,
Major? Let me pull the bell, Lady Rossville."
Why, to tell you the truth, the Major and I had agreed,
before we set out, that if we found you living quietly here,
and no company, we would have no objection to spend a
day or two with you en famille;' but as I go nowhere at
present, it must be upon condition that I remain quite incog."
Mrs. St. Clair already repented of her invitation; and
Gertrude could only say, “ We are quite a family party."
“ In that case then, Major, I think we must remain where
You had better speak to Robert yourself about the
horses, and tell Cæsar to see that everything is taken out of
the carriage. As we were quite uncertain of remaining, I
didn't think of bringing my own maid with me; and, Major,
I think I must have left my vinaigrette in one of the pockets
of the carriage; when one travels in their own carriage, they
are so apt to litter it, you know, and leave things lying about,
that really mine is almost like my dressing-room.
"A very handsome carriage it is," said Miss Pratt, as it
wheeled past the windows.
“Very plain—but the Major and I are both partial to
everything plain."
This plainness consisted in a bright blue body, with large
scarlet arms, bearing the Black and Waddell quarterings,
mantle, crest, cipher, couped gules, and all appliances to
boot.
“ By-the-bye, I hear strange things of my poor uncle,"
said Mrs. Major, when the carriage was out of sight.
" I'm
told, cousin, you found him all but dead in his own house, and
had him carried away in a fit. The Major and I were from
home at the time; we were on a visit at Lord Fairacre's, and
heard nothing of it till two days ago, that we returned, or I
should certainly have made a point of seeing after him, poor
man.--He is not confined to his bed, I hope ? Does he know
we are here, I wonder?"
“I shall let him know myself," said Lady Rossville, who
instantly conjectured, that if uncle Adam came unwarily to

235
the knowledge of the Major and lady being under the same
roof with himself, stone and lime could scarcely contain him.
She, therefore, (glad, at the same time, of an excuse for leav-
ing her company,) hastened to the yellow turret. She tapped
several times at the door, but received no answer; she
listened, all was silent; she slowly opened the door, no notice
was taken; she looked in, and there sat uncle Adam, with
spectacles on nose, so intent upon a book, that all his senses
seemed to be completely lapped in its pages. Gertrude coughed,
but in vain ; she spoke, but it was to the walls ; she went
close
up to him, but he saw her not; at length, she ventured
to lay her hand on his shoulder, and-Guy Mannering dropped
upon the floor.
“You seem to be much interested in your studies," said
Lady Rossville, as she stooped to pick it up for him.
Mr. Ramsay purpled with shame, as he tried to affect a
tone of indifference, and said, “00-I-hem-it's just a
wheen idle havers there that I-just-hem-They maun
hae little to do, that tak up their heads writing sic non-
sense."
"I never heard the author accused of idleness before,"
said Lady Rosville, with a smile; 66 and no one need be
ashamed to own the interest excited by these wonderful
works of genius."
“ Interesst-hugh !-Folk may hae other things to in-
teresst them, I think, in this world. I wonder if there's ony
o't true ? I canna think how ae man could sit down to con-
trive a' that. I dinna misdoot that scondrel Glossin at a'. I
would gi'e a thoosand pound out o' my pocket to see that
rascal hanged, if hanging wasna ower gude for him!'
“Well, you may be at ease on that head, as even worse
befalls him," said Lady Rossville.
“Weel, I rejoice in that I for if that scoondrel had gotten
leave to keep that property, by my troth, I believe, I would
have burnt the book ;'?—then, ashamed of his ardour in such
a cause, he added in a peevish tone-"But it's a' nonsense
thegither, and I'm no gaun to fash my head ony mair about
it."
Lady Rossville now announced the arrival of the Waddells
in the most conciliating manner she could, but in any way it
was an event to rouse all uncle Adam's angry feelings, though
for some minutes he said nothing, but merely walked round
and round the turret, rubbing his forehead, as if at a loss how
to proceed. Al last he stopped and said,
“I ken weel enough what's brought them here. That
creature, though she is a fule, has the cunning o' Auld Nick
himsel'; but you may just tell her frae me, she'll mak nae-

awa.
thing o'me-she shall ne'er see ae bawbee o’mine; you may
just tell her that."
Gertrude here attempted a sort of vindication of her cousin
from such debasing suspicions ; but she was cut short with,-
“ Weel, if ye winna tell her, I'll tell her mysel'. I'm no
gaun to be hunted up and down, in and out, that I canna turn
mysel', but Maister and Mrs. Major Waddell maun be at my
heels;" and he resumed his perambulations, as if to give the
lie to his words by his actions.
“ I'm just switherin',” resumed he, “whether to quit the
hooss this minute, or whether to stay still and see the crea-
ters oot o't;" then, as his eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, glanced
from Lizzie Lundie to Guy Mannering, he added, " But I'll
no gi'e them the satisfaction o' thinking they ha'e driven me
I daursay that's just what she wants, so I'll stay still
where I am."
This magnanimous resolution formed, Lady Rossville tried
to prevail upon him to return to the saloon with her, to meet
his relatives, but in vain ; he declared, that till dinner was on
the table, he would not stir from where he was, and Lady
Rossville, who had too much sense to attempt to combat his
prejudices openly, was obliged to leave him, and make the
best excuse she could for his non-appearance. No sooner
had she left the room, than Mr. Ramsay locked and bolted
the door, to prevent any further intrusion, and after a few
glances at Lizzie, his ruffled pinions were smoothed, and he
returned with unabated ardour to his studies.
Colonel Delmour and Mr. Lyndsay had both joined the
party during Gertrude's absence ; and she again felt some-
thing like shame as she marked her lover's lofty bearing to-
wards her relations, while the Major seemed to grow ten
times sillier, and his lady twenty times more affected in their
struggles to keep on par with him. With Lyndsay it was
otherwise ; for although his manners were not less elegant,
yet as they emanated from better feelings, so they never op-
pressed others with the painful consciousness of their own in-
feriority; and even the Major and lady in his company might
have become something better, had not his benign influence
been counteracted by the haughty port and humiliating con-
descension of the other. But his horses had been some time
announced, and he set out upon his ride to Millbank House.
“Do you know, I begin to think Mr. Lyndsay really quite
handsome, and his mannere extremely pleasing," said Mrs.
Major, with an air as thouhý her approbation set the seal to
him at once.
" He sits his horse remarkably well," said the Major ; "I
wonder whether he ever was in the dragoons ?”

“Do you walk to-day, Lady Rossville ?" demanded Colo-
nel Delmour abruptly.
As the expedition to Bellevue was now given
up, Gertrude
answered in the affirmative, and invited Mrs. Waddell to be
of the party.
0, you must first get my lord and master's leave for
that. Major, what would you think of my taking a walk to-
day?” looking very archly to the rest of the company.
The Major looked distressed.
“Why, you know, Isabella, the very last time you walked
was to see Lord Fairacre's new pinery, and you certainly
caught cold, for you may remember Lady Fairacre remarked,
next morning, how heavy your eyes were, and I think you
look a little pale to-day, my love."
* There now! I kaew how it would be. You see how
completely I am under orders. However, I beg I mayn't
prevent you from indulging your taste in a rural stroll-with
your beau," added she, in a whisper, to Lady Rossville, who,
ashamed and wearied of such intolerable folly, rose and went
to prepare
for a walk, at the same time, in a general way, in-
viting such of the party as chose to accompany her.
On returning, she found the party was to consist of herself
and the two gentlemen. Lady Betty and Mrs. St. Clair
(like Mrs. Waddell) never walked when they could help it,
and Miss Pratt had attached herself so assiduously to the na-
bobess, and had so much to tell and to say, that, contrary to
her usual practice, she was a fixture for the day.
“ Major Waddell,” cried Mrs. St. Clair, in her most au-
thoritative manner, as they were leaving the room,
ber I commit Lady Rossville solely to your care e-Gertrude,
you will be at pains to point out to Major Waddell the beau-
ties of Rossville, and get his opinion of the improvements you
have begun."
“ You see what you have brought upon yourself, Major,
by your care of me," cried his lady, not much delighted with
this arrangement, which she thought was rather interfering
with her privileges.
Lady Rossville and Colonel Delmour were too much an-
noyed at this appendage to say anything; the latter, indeed,
was revolving in his own mind how to dismiss him the mo-
ment they were out of sight, and the Countess was hesitating
whether she should do more than merely take a single turn be-
fore the house under such guardianship, when, as they crossed
the hall, Mrs. Waddell's voice was heard loudly calling the
Major back, and the lady herself presently appeared in great
agitation.
“ Now, Major, is it possible you were really going out

without your cloak, when you know very well you were so
hoarse this morning that I could scarcely hear what you
said ?"
“ Well, for Heaven's sake, compose yourself, my dear
girl," said the Major, in a whisper.
“Now, Major, that is impossible, unless you put on your
cloak.”
But, I assure you, I am much more likely to catch cold
with my cloak than without it. Why, this is almost like a
day in Bengal. I do assure you my cloak would be quite
overcoming."
“Now, Major
“Well, well, my dear, don't say any more. Do, I beseech
you, compose yourself ;-but this cloak is so confoundedly
heavy-do just feel it.”
"Now, Major-"
“Well, no matter, my dear; anything to make you easy;"
and the poor Major buckled on his apparatus, while the lady
set up the collar, clasped the brooch, and drew the volumin-
ous folds close round his person, already bursting at every
pore.
“Now, Major, be sure you keep it close round you, and,
for any sake, don't open your collar-Do you promise ? is
“But, my dear Bell-
“Well, Major, I can only say-
“Well, well,” gasped the poor Major, " that is enough.”
“There now, I feel quite comfortable,” said the lady, as
she completed her operations.
“It is more than I do,” thought the Major, as he slowly
sallied forth, and caught a glimpse of Lady Rossville and
Colonel Delmour, who had taken advantage of this conjugal
delay to make their escape. “So my companions have got
the start of me;" and he footed away as fast as his short legs
and ponderous cloak permitted. But, in vain, like panting
Time, did he toil after the fugitives, whose light figures and
elastic steps mocked his utmost exertions to overtake them ;
and the provoking part of it was, that, while he was puffing,
and blowing, and sawing the air with his arms, without ever
gaining a single step upon them, they had the appearance of
sauntering along quite at their ease, and deaf to his repeated
calls.

CHAPTER L.

MEANWHILE the lovers had much to say to each other; but,
for a time, the eloquence and the vehemence of Colonel Del-
mour bore down the softer accents of the Countess, as he
pleaded his suit in all the energy of passion, and appealed to
herself, as a witness of the injurious treatment he met with
from Mrs. St. Clair. But when he proceeded to urge imme-
diate union, as the only means of putting an end to the ma-
chinations against him, she stopped him by saying, “ Do not
renew that subject again for years to come, as you love me.
I have promised my mother that I will enter into no engage-
ment till I am twenty-one, but I promise you then-
“ Then,” interrupted Delmour, impetuously," that is a
mere mockery. Gertrude, if you loved as I do, you would
not talk so calmly of what may be years hence-every day
seems to me an eternity, until you are mine beyond the power
of fate to separate us.
Years! Better tell me at once that I
have nothing to hope ; despair itself would be almost a bless-
ing compared to this intolerable agony
of suspense."
* Ah i Delmour, why should you be so unjust to yourself
and me as to talk thus? I have no doubts of your faith and
constancy, why should you have any of mine ?"
“ Because no one can love as I do to distraction, without
inquietude-passion without passion is an anomaly I cannot
comprehend."
“And love without confidence in the person beloved seems
to me still more inconceivable ; I have no more doubt of your
fidelity than I have of my own."
“But everything will be done to destroy your confidence in
me-your mother is ambitious, Gertrude, she wants a more
splendid alliance for you ; she thinks I am unworthy of you,
and perhaps she is right."
“But in that I must choose for myself, and she knows
my choice is made," said the Countess with a blush.
“ But not confirmed. Ahl Gertrude, would to God you
loved as I do that you could conceive the miseries of separa-
tion—the worse than death it will be to me to part from you."
“ But we shall see each other frequently; you must give
up the army-you must not go abroad again-indeed you
must not—and then two years will soon pass away.”.
“And in that time, what may not be effected by the misre-
presentations of your mother, and the artful insinuations of
that cold-blooded stoic, Lyndsay ?”

“ You wrong your cousin, indeed you do, by such a sup-
position: he is far above anything of the kind.”
“ Has he never once said anything that had a tendency to
injure me in your estimation ? " demanded Colonel Delmour,
turning his eyes full upon her.
“If he had, he has certainly been very unsuccessful,” said
the Countess with a smile ; " but, indeed, Edward is incapa-
ble of meanly insinuating-
What, he spoke out then!” exclaimed Delmour passion-
ately; " he told you of the follies and the extravagances of
my boyish days, in which, however, he himself went hand in
hand--and exaggerated them into vices
and warned you to
beware of the profligate, who had lost, I forget how many
hundred pounds one night at cards."
“No, indeed, he told me nothing of all this—you wrong
him-you misunderstand each other; but you must be better
friends, now that he is my guardian."
“ Your guardian !" exclaimed Delmour, as if thunder-
struck; what, in the name of heaven, do you mean?”
“Even that it seems it was necessary for me to have guar-
dians appointed, and so I have made choice of my cousin for
one; he has already proved himself my friend on more occa-
sions than one, and to him I think I owe my life ; you cannot,
therefore, wonder at my choice.”
“Yet you must be aware that Lyndsay is no friend to me,
nor, I confess it, am I to him: we think differently, upon
most subjects, and his creed is much too bigoted and intole-
rant for me."
"Indeed, I have not found him so; on the contrary, I
should
say he was extremely liberal in his sentiments, and
lenient in his judgments; and, I am sure, he has a great deal
more toleration than I have. I wish I saw you both better
friends-why should it not be so ?”
“Because I am no hypocrite, Gertrude ; and, perhaps, also
because--shall I confess my weakness to you ?- I am jealous
that
you should bestow so much of your regard upon him.”
“ Jealous of my regard for Edward Lyndsay !' exclaimed
the Countess ; “then you would be jealous if I had a brother
whom I loved.”
“Yes, I believe I should ; when a man loves, as I do, to
adoration, he can seldom brook any interference in those af-
fections which ought to be exclusively his own; your luke-
warm sort of people, I know, make all welcome; but I am
not one of these. "Ah! Gertrude, woman's heart is, indeed a
royal palace, if it admit but one guest, and then, 'tis a glo-
rious privilege to be that one."
“Nay, you would rather turn it into a cell, I think,” said
Gertrude, smiling, "and become yourself a moping monk.”

"No matter what it is, provided it is mine-solely and ex-
clusively mine," returned Delmour, impatiently.
“But being yours, wholly yours," said the Countess, and
she blushed at the tone of emphatic tenderness with which
she said it; “surely you would not wish it to be unjust and
ungrateful to all the world beside—such a thing would be no
better worth having than this pebble on which I tread," as
she touched one with her foot.
“Do not blame me, Gertrude, because, conscious that I
possess a pearl richer than all its tribe, I fear to leave it open
to all, lest even a part of it should be stolen from me. Com-
mon things may be shared, but who could lose the hundredth
part of a rare and costly gem, without feeling that its value
was gone? Even such a miser am I with your affections.
You are all the universe to me; day and night I think, I
dream but of you—a desert island in the midst of the ocean
with you would be a paradise. Gertrude, if you shared in
these feelings, how little would you think or care for others
in comparison."
“ Alas! you little know, but how shall I convince you,
sceptic as you are, of my-folly ?" added she with a smile
you would not have me perjured, and to my mother ; or
drive from my house a friend and relation, to whom I owe so
much, or retract my word passed to him, when I chose him
for
my guardian ? "
Colonel Delmour remained silent.
“Surely you would not have me so base as to do any of
those things, nor would you value such proofs of my attach-
ment."
Colonel Delmour found he had gone far enough for the pre-
sent, and that, gentle and feminine as Gertrude
was, his influ-
ence over her mind must be more gradual than he had expected.
He saw that he was beloved with all the fervour and simpli-
city of a young confiding heart, but love with her was yet too
pure, unsullied a passion, to have tainted the better feelings
of her nature. These still flowed free and generous ; she
loved and was beloved, and her heart expanded beneath the
joyous influence, and the bright rainbow hues of hope and
fancy tinged every object with their own celestial colours.
But no shade of suspicion or mistrust fell on the noontide of
her happiness. Even the narrow, selfish, domineering senti-
ments she had just heard fall from the lips of her lover,
seemed to her to breathe only the quintessence of love, and
she looked on him in all the calm radiance of a happy trust-
ing heart.
“ Be it as you will, Gertrude,” said he, “my fate is in
your hands-you know your power, for I have told you what

you not ?"
I am proud, jealous, vindictive perhaps, where you are con-
cerned; but such as I am you have vowed to be mine-have
“When I am twenty-one; that is, unless you should change
your mind," added she, sportively.
“I change !" repeated he; no, Gertrude, you will see
many a strange sight before that comes to pass-this river
may change its course, and these rocks may change into
plains, but my heart can never change in its love for you.”
Much more of the same sort passed, for lovers, it is well
known, carry the art of tautology to its utmost perfection, and
even the most impatient of them can both bear to hear and
repeat the same things times without number, till the sound
becomes the echo to the sense or the nonsense previously
uttered. But lovers' walks and lovers' vows must have an
end, and Lady Rossville and Colonel Delmour found them-
selves at the Castle, ere they had uttered one hundreth part
of all they had to say.
CHAPTER LI.
" What have you done with the Major ?" exclaimed his lady,
as they entered the saloon, and found her and Miss Pratt
with their heads together.
Gertrude was at a loss how to answer this question, as, till
this moment, she had as completely forgot the Major as
though no such person were in existence.
“ Where in the world is the Major ?" was repeated in a
voice of alarm.
“Very snug in his cloak, probably," answered Colonel Del-
mour, with a disdainful smile.
“ Lady Rossville-cousin, I intreat of you, what has become
of the Major ?"
“I daresay he is not far off," answered the Countess; " but
he did not overtake us."
“Good gracious !” exclaimed the lady, all panting with
alarm, “did he not overtake you? then the Major is lost!"
“My dear Mrs. Waddell, don't distress yourself," began
Miss Pratt ;="depend upon it he'll cast up; there's good
daylight yet, and he may meet some of the work-people in
the woods; and we'll send out some of the servants to seek
for him. Colonel Delmour, will you pull the bell? He never
would think of taking the Crow-Foot Crag, and that's the
only ugly turn about the banks—Lady Rossville, I'll thank
you for the smelling-bottle there--there's not much water in

"
the river just now-Jackson, a glass of water here as quick's
you can, and send out some of the men to look for Major
Waddell
“With bells, ropes, and lanthorns," said Colonel Delmour.
" There is Major Waddell, ma'am,” said the pompous
Jackson, as he glanced his eye, but without turning his head,
towards the window.
“Where ?-Oh!
where ?” exclaimed his lady, as she flew
to the window. “ Thank God l" as she again sunk upon her
seat.
The Major it certainly was in 'propria persona,' slowly and
laboriously plodding his weary way, close buttoned to the
chin, though evidently ready to drop with heat and fatigue.
He carried a handkerchief in his hand, which he ever and
anon applied to his face, which shone forth like a piece of
polished yew. To add to his perturbation, Miss Pratt, throw-
ing open a window, screeched out to him
"Come away, Major, make haste ;-here's your good lady
in hysterics almost about you."
The poor Major, uttering an ejaculation of despair, did his
utmost to mend his pace, and again the drooping capes, arms,
sails, and tails of his cloak were all in commotion, as the in-
ward man struggled and plunged amidst the toils of broad-
cloth and timmen, till at length the whole mass came floun-
dering into the room.
" O, Major !" exclaimed his lady, faintly, as she rose to
meet him.
“My sweet girl, what is all this?” cried the Major, as he
cast back part of his folds, and extended his arms like claws
towards her.
“I have been so frightened about you, Major. You must
have met with something; you are so heated, and-do tell
me what has happened; I see you have met with some-
thing."
“ My dearest girl, I do assure you I have met with nothing.
I have been rather on a wild-goose chace to be sure, trying
to overtake my charge, the Countess there; but,” turning to
Colonel Delmour and her, “I could not make you hear me
at all, though I had you in sight almost all the way.” At this
remark there was a smile on Colonel Delmour's lip, and a
slight blush on Lady Rossville's cheek, which Miss Pratt did
not like, and a sort of vague tremour ran through her frame.
“That was very odd," said Mrs. Major, recovering—“I
never doubted you were all together. shall take care an-
other time how I trust you to walk without me.

seech you, don't think of taking off your cloak, till you are
cooler."
My dear Bell,” gasped the almost suffocating Major.
“Now, Major, I intreat of you-
But, 'pon my soul, this is a thousand degrees hotter than
ever I felt it in Bengal.”
“Well—but, Major, you know very well how ill you were
in consequence of throwing off your cloak suddenly one
sunny day, when you had got yourself overheated, and you
promised me, that you never would do so again."
But, my dear Bell, this is absolutely like a day in June."
" Now, Major, I can only say-
But happily for all concerned, the lady's sayings were here
stopped by the sound of the dressing-bell, and, half distracted
betwixt her desire to superintend the cooling of the Major,
by keeping him in a hot room enveloped in his cloak, and her
anxiety to dedicate the full three-quarters of an hour to the
duties of her toilette, and the display of her Oriental finery,
she felt much at a loss which to choose ; at length, the woman
prevailed over the wite, and the Major was allowed to betake
himself to his dressing-room, while the lady repaired to hers.

CHAPTER LII.
LADY ROSSVILLE and Colonel Delmour found themselves
together in the drawing-room, where they flattered them-
Belves with enjoying an uninterrupted tête-à-tête. But within
the drawing-room was a small turret, containing piles of
music, porte-feuilles of drawings and engravings, heaps of
worsteds and sewing silks, and, in short, a variety of miscel-
laneous articles, which the Countess had not yet had leisure
to look over. This was a favourite haunt of Miss Pratt's,
who was fond of picking and grubbing amongst other people's
goods; not that she actually stole, but that, as she expressed
it, she often met with bits of things that were of no use to
anybody, and that when she showed to Lady Rossville, she
always made her welcome to. For some time her head had
been completely immersed in a large Indian chest, containing
many odds and ends, a few of which she had selected for the
purpose of being hinted for, and she was just shaking her
ears from the cobwebs they might have contracted in their
researches, when they were suddenly smote with the sound
of her own name, pronounced by Colonel Delmour ; she

manner,
beard the Countess's voice in reply, but it was too soft and
low to enable her to ascertain her words.
“ Since Miss Pratt is disagreeable to you, and odious to me,
why don't you dismiss her the house, then?” asked Colonel
Delmour. “Much as you despise her, she may do mischief.
-Ah, Gertrude !"–Bút here Colonel Delmour's voice sank
into a tenderer strain, and its undistinguishable accents only
penetrated the massive door which was betwixt them. Miss
Pratt had met with many a buffet in her day, but she never
had met with anything like this, and her ears tingled with
rage and mortification at hearing herself talked of in such a
“I wish Anthony Whyte heard him," was her first mental
ejaculation, though, even to herself, had she considered a
moment, the mortifying conviction must have been, that, if
Anthony Whyte did hear it, it would only be to laugh at it.
She tried to make out something more, which might prove
either a confirm or a refutation of this opprobrious ex-
pression; but "love-doubts-adore-agony --suspense-
unalterable heart-wholly mine," &c. were all she could pick
up. But these were too much; the sword that had just fallen
upon her cut two ways, if not three; her respectability (and
that was her weak side) was compromised; her footing in a
house she had long looked upon as a home was endangered,
and her five guineas were in the most imminent peril. In
short, she found she was in a very great scrape, and the best
thing she could do at present would be to take the first word
of flyting' and depart.
“Dismiss, indeed! dismiss one's own blood !” and Miss
Pratt danced and bubbled at the bare thought of such a
thing. There was a little back stair from the turret, by which
she could emerge without going through the drawing-room
and confronting her adversaries, and to that she betook her-
self, and, after a little searching, found the Major and his
lady just beginning to recover their equilibrium. When one's
mind is ruffled, it is always a satisfaction to meet with others
in the same state, especially when the cause is somewhat
similar, and though neither party would for the world have
betrayed to the other the cause of its discomposure, yet both
felt that sort of secret sympathy which made it “hail fellow,
well met!”
Miss Pratt was too experienced in the art of offering visits,
securing a seat in a friend's carriage, and such like manæuvres,
to be at any loss on the present occasion ; and as the Major
and lady, in spite of all their finery, were not particularly
sought after, they were much flattered at the compliment, and
8001 settled that she should accompany them, in the first

instance, to Thornbank, where she insinuated she would not
be allowed to remain long, as both Lady Wellwood and Lady
Restall would go mad, if they heard she was in their neigh-
bourhood, till they got hold of her.
This important point settled, the next thing to be done was
to give all possible bustle and importance to her departure,
that she might not appear to have been driven away by any-
thing that insolent puppy had said ;--she had no notion of
sneaking away, as if her nose had been bleeding, or showing
herself any way flustered, or giving him the slightest satis-
faction in any way. She, therefore, went openly to work,
rang all the bells, called to the servants, spoke loudly, but
calmly, about her preparations to Lady Betty and Mrs. St.
Clair, and finally repaired to the room where she had left
the Countess and her lover, and where she still found them.
"Well, Lady Rossville, I'm just come to apologise to you
for doing what is really an ill-bred thing; but your good
friends, the Major and his lady, have prevailed upon me to
take a seat in their carriage, and, as there's many visits I
ought to have paid long ago, our cousins the Millbanks for
one, I'm just going to run away from you. I declare there's
the carriage ; and, by-the-bye, Countess, there's a bit of
Indian silk I have of yours that I got for a pattern, and have
always forgot to return, but I shall bring it with me next time
I come,” with a look of cool defiance at Colonel Delmour.
“ You are perfectly welcome to it," said Lady Rossville, in
some little embarrassment what to say next;
is but this is a
very
sudden resolution of yours.”
"I'm a great enemy to your long preparations ; a long
warning is just a lingering parting, as Mr. Whyte says, 80
fareweli. God bless you, my dearl and take care of your-
self," in a most emphatic and oracular tone; “take care of
yourself, and,"-in à loud whisper—" if you would take an
old friend's advice, you would dismiss at least one of your
lovers," with a glance at Colonel Delmour, who, from the
moment of her entrance, had been amusing himself with a
musical snuff-box, which he continued to play off with the
most unceasing attention, as if quite unconscious other
presence. Gertrude was leaving the room with Miss Pratt,
to do the parting honour to her guests, when, looking up, he
called—“Shall I walk to the stables now, and examine the
state of your stud, or shall I wait for you ?".
“I am no judge of horses," answered the Countess,
shall leave that department entirely to you ;" and she passed
on to the saloon, before Miss Pratt could find words to express
her indignation at finding he had already begun to interfere
in the Rossville ménage. All was now leave-taking-regrets,

compliments, promises and invitations, and final adieus—and
the trio at length were wheeled off. Much solace they found
in each other's society during the drive, for each and all of
them had something to animadvert upon as to the state of
affairs at Rossville.
Uncle Adam missed Migs Pratt at dinner, and the kind
message she had left for him with Mrs. St. Clair was not
delivered. Lyndsay was out of spirits, and Lady Rossville
was inattentive; and, in short, uncle Adam began to feel
himself one too many. He was also within two pages of the
end of Guy Mannering; and, therefore, upon retiring to his
chamber, he sent off a line to the Blue Boar, desiring a
chaise might be sent for him the following morning at six
o'clock.
CHAPTER LIII.
The seeds of false shame were beginning to be sown in Lady
Rossville's heart, and she was secretly pleased when she
heard of uncle Adam's intended departure. She felt the con-
trast between Colonel Delmour and him was too much; the
gulf seemed impassable that was betwixt them, and it was
painful to her to feel that she was ashamed of her uncle.
“I wonder why I never felt this with Edward Lyndsay,"
thought she; " it must be that he is not so refined in his
ideas as Delmour," and with that answer the thought passed
away from her mind. She, however, pressed her uncle to
wait breakfast, and to accept of her carriage to take him
home ; but he was resolute in taking his own way, which was
commonly the most uncomfortable that could be contrived.
“ Fare ye weel," said he, with something of softness in his
look and manner, ye want naething frae me, so you'll tak
naething."
· No, indeed, my
dear uncle," said Gertrude, affectionately
shaking his hand," I do not require anything; but I shall
always remember your kindness to me when I did ; I only
wish I could make you as hippy as-as I am myself," added
she, with a smile.
Mr. Ramsay shook his head, and uttered something betwixt
a groan and a hem.
Weel, weel, I wish it may last, but “rue and thyme grow
baith in ae garden;' but I need nae fash to gi'e ye ony o' my
advice, for whan folk need naething else, they'll no tak that;
so fare ye weel;" and with something amounting almost to a

squeeze of the hand, in its own uncouth way, the uncle and
niece parted. Her relief from the presence of her mother's
relations was, however, of short duration.
The following days were almost entirely devoted to business,
for Lord Millbank and Mr. Alexander Black came to Ross-
ville, and long meetings and discussions ensued, at many of
which Gertrude was obliged to be present, to her and Colonel
Delmour's infinite weariness and chagrin. His only solace,
during the hours she was shut up from him, was in lounging
about the house and grounds, devising plans of useless
expense, which he longed impatiently to have put in execu-
tion. No views of beneficence or charity made any part of
his schemes ; his every idea centered in self-indulgence, and
luxury and magnificence were all to which he looked as his
recompense.
At length the business was brought to a conclusion, and
Gertrude was once more at liberty, for Mrs. St. Clair, after
several ineffectual attempts to gain the entire direction of
her daughter, and the control of her every action, found
it vain, and she was therefore obliged to carry the reins with
a light hand, lest the Countess should have sought to free
herself from them altogether.
Lyndsay alone, of all the guests, now remained, and he
still lingered, as though loth to give her up entirely to the
influence of Colonel Delmour. He was aware that the heart
cannot be long and exclusively devoted to one object, without
contracting somewhat of affinity towards it ; and he sighed in
bitterness of spirit, when he thought how Gertrude's nature,
even now, with all its faults, still 80 pure, so lofty, so gene-
rous, so amiable, would be debased and rverted by the
baser alloy with which it mingled. What a different
creature might she become under other guidance, so easily
managed when her affections led the way |--what capacities
of happiness for herself and others seemed now at stake !
But, alas ! how misdirected, how useless, if not pernicious,
might they become under such control l-and Lyndsay,
unlike himself, became wavering and irresolute as to the part
he ought to act. Every day seemed to increase the alienation
betwixt Colonel Delmour and him; but on Lyndsay's part
it was so calm and mild, so free from all wrath and bitterness,
that it might have escaped notice altogether, but for the sort
of repressed animosity which the other occasionally betrayed.
“Why is it," said "Lady Rossville one day to her lover,
" that Édward and you are not better friends ? Has any
misunderstanding taken place betwixt you, for you are not
even upon the same terms you were when I first saw you ?

Then
you walked, rode, shot, conversed together, but now you
seem carefully to avoid all intercourse. It is unpleasant to
me to witness this."
“ 'Tis you yourself are the cause of it, Gertrude," answered
Colonel Delmour, warmly. “How can you imagine I can
endure the sight of a man who, knowing the terms we are
upon, yet presuming upon the encouragement you give him,
dares to love you, and is, at this moment, planning to under-
mine me in your affections ? By Heaven, I think I am but
too patient !"
Lyndsay love me!" exclaimed the Countess ;
fancy l" but, at the same moment, a confused crowd of half-
formed, half-forgotten thoughts rushed upon her mind, and
raised a blush on her cheek, which did not escape Delmour's
notice.
“Yes, in his own cold blooded, methodistical way, not in
the
way I love you-to madness—to idolatry. His existence,
his soul, are not bound up in you as mine are; but he would
supplant me if he could."
“His love_must, indeed, be of a different nature from
yours," said Lady Rossville, trying to laugh away Colonel
Delmour's roused passion, "for he has scarcely ever said a
civil thing to me, and as for a compliment, I have sometimes
tried whether I could not extort one from him, but never
have succeeded. Nay, don't frown so, Delmour. If Lynd-
say does not flatter, at least he never frowns.”
This remark did not dispel the cloud from her lover's
brow; on the contrary, he bit his lip, as if to repress the
rising of his anger. After a few moments he said, in a sub-
dued voice, “I
have never flattered you, if by flattering you
mean insincerity ; but I had flattered myself that you had
been above practising those paltry arts, by which so many
women seek to enhance their value. I flattered myself,
Gertrude, that you had been superior to coquetry; but when
I see you encouraging the attentions of one, who presumes to
love you, even in the face of him to whom you have given
your vows-one, too, whom you must know to be my enemy-
can you wonder that I am sometimes driven to hate him, and
almost to doubt whether you really love me?"
“Unjust, unkind I" said Lady Rossville, turning from him
in displeasure.
“No, Gertrude, 'tis you who are unjust, unkind; my
heart is solely yours ; its every thought and wish centre in
you; but it must have yours-yours wholly and undivided in
return; less will not satisfy love such as mine."
Lady Rossville remained silent, and Colonel Delmour's
agitation increased.

"I see how it is,” cried he, passionately; "his artful
insinuations have prevailed; but
he shall answer for
this."
Gertrude laid her hand upon his arm, while tears burst
from her eyes.
“Ah, Delmour ! if you love me as you say you do, why do
you thus grieve me? I would not for worlds willingly afflict
But you do,” interrupted he; "you torture me to agony,
and when I dare to complain, you reproach me."
“Tell me what it is you require of me, since all I have
done and suffered for your sake is insufficient."
“All that I require of you, Gertrude, is, that you will not
at least ask me to become the bosom friend of one who,
I know, seeks to undermine me in your affections. I cannot
be the friend of a hypocrite.".
“Edward a hypocrite! Ah, Delmour, how your passion
misleads you! He is all truth and openness; he is, in-
deed then, after a pause,-“When I look back a few
months, and think of the state of incertitude I was then in as
to your faith and constancy-when at times my own was
almost shaken by my doubts-at such a time had Lyndsay
been what you suppose, had he sought to ingratiate himself
with me I do not know I cannot tell—perhaps he might
have gained an influence over me. But, indeed, he never
tried, he never spoke to me as a lover ; but, on every
occasion he proved himself my friend; as such I must always
consider him. Do not, then, dear Delmour, embitter my
peace with any of those idle jealousies; the time is past,'
added she, with a smile, "for Lyndsay to think of loving me
now."
“But he does loves you, Gertrude ; I read it in the
agitation he betrayed upon my arrival—he
guessed his schemes
would then be frustrated
he knew that I detested all under-
hand plots, and would come boldly forward, and bring matters
to an issue. I did so; you have promised to be mine; he
knows
you have, and yet he would supplant me if he could.
And is it right in you, Gertrude, warned as you are of all
this, to continue to encourage him, and lavish your attentions
on him?"
“What can I do?” asked the Countess, beginning to give
way to her lover's vehemence, and to believe that she really
was doing wrong ; " what would you have me do?"
“Nay, it is not for me, Gertrude, to point out the line of
conduct you ought to pursue: I leave that to yourself.
I would have concealed from you, if I could, all that you
have made me suffer ; but when you call upon me to make a

her eyes, as she leaned her head upon her hand.

cause.
From this time Gertrude's manner was wholly changed
towards her cousin. Instead of the sweet smile with which
she used to welcome him, her eyes were now commonly
averted from him, and an air of constraint and embarrassment
had succeeded the open, confiding carelessness which had
hitherto marked their intercourse.
Lyndsay felt the change, and was at no loss to guess the
The books they had been reading together, the songs
they used to sing together, were now discarded for others of
Colonel Delmour's choice, and she read and sang with him,
and with him only. The plans they had been carrying on
together were stopped or overturned, and others of a totally
different nature were adopted.
“Will you walk with me to-day, Gertrude ?" asked Lynd-
say, one morning, when he accidentally was left alone with
her; “it is long since you have seen your school-house ;

should you not like to look at it, and see what progress it has
made since we last saw it together?"
Certainly, I should like very much to see it; but the
phaeton and horses Colonel Delmour ordered for me have
arrived, and I promised to take a drive with him.”
"Perhaps you will drive that way, and I shall meet you
there?”
“ I am afraid it will not be possible;" then, after a pause,
she added, “I am afraid you will think me very foolish and
expensive, as you tell me I have not much money to squander;
but Colonel Delmour and I discovered such a lovely little
spot lately on the banks of the river, just a little below the
cascade you know, a sort of tiny Paradise, that the thought
struck us both of making a sort of miniature of a 'ferme
ornée,' quite a baby-house thing, in fact, a sort of Lilliputian
beau ideal of rustic life,” said she, attempting, by a laugh, to
hide her confusion, " with a flower-garden and all sorts of
prettinesses, for you know flowers are my passion, and we
appointed to meet some of the people there to-day, to talk
and walk over it; but I am afraid you will think-
“You did not use to be so afraid of me, Gertrude," said
Lyndsay mildly, but gravely; "what have I done to inspire
you with so much dread ?"
“You know you are my guardian now," said she, with an
assumed gaiety;
“of course, it is my duty to be a little afraid
of you, especially when I know I deserve a scold."
will be relieved from your fears, I shall leave
you to-day.”
“My dear cousin, I spoke but in jest,” cried Gertrude,
thrown off her guard, and relapsing into her natural manner.
“ Not entirely,” said Lyndsay, with a melancholy smile;
"but, whether you fear me or not, I feel you no longer look
upon me as your
friend.'
“Indeed you wrong me,” cried the Countess, in emotion;
“I never can cease to regard you as my friend, would you but
become the friend of those who are dear to me."
“Impossible !” exclaimed Lyndsay, while a flush passed
over his face, and he was for a moment silent; he then
added, in a calmer tone, “I trust I am no one's enemy; I
wish well to all mankind, and so far I may style myself
the friend of all; but, with some characters, farther I cannot

she was evidently displeased.
“You distrust me, Gertrude," said Lyndsay, at length
breaking silence, "and that is worse than being afraid of

“I am, perhaps, too little distrustful of any one,”
answered she; “it is not my nature to suspect evil; I hope
it never will; surely there are other marks by which we may
know those who love us, than any that base suspicion can
furnish us with."
Yes, and here is one,” said Lyndsay, taking a book from
amongst a mass of French novels which lay upon the sofa-
table. It was the Life of Colonel Hutchinson; and Lyndsay
had begun to read it to her before Colonel Delmour's arrival,
since when it had lain neglected; "here is a picture of true
and faithful love; who studies that may soon learn to dis-
tinguish the real from the counterfeit;' and he read that
simple description of the perfection of human attachment
with an emotion which showed how deeply he felt it.
He laid down the book, but Lady Rossville made no com-
ment; she continued to busy herself arranging some fine
forced flowers, which had just been brought her, in a vase,
and seemed to give her whole attention to them. This con-
tinued for some minutes, and Lyndsay made no attempt to
interrupt her; but, on hearing the sound of a carriage, she
raised her head, and saw the phaeton driven by Colonel Del-
mour, and drawn by four beautiful horses, followed by two
grooms, mounted on two of the same set. A throb of pride
and pleasure was felt at her heart, as she looked at the elegant
bauble which had stopped opposite the saloon; and as she
threw open
the sash with childish delight, Delmour called to
her, to know if she was ready. She answered in the affirma-
tive, and was leaving the room to put on her things, when
Lyndsay said
“Is it thus, then, we are to part, Gertrude, after all the
pleasant friendly days we have passed together?"
Lady Rossville stopped, and turned towards him—" You
are not serious in thinking of leaving us to-day?"
“I am, indeed, perfectly so."
“At least, stay till to-morrow; this is such a strange hur-
ried
way of leaving us; pray, give us one day more."
“I would give you many days if they could be of service
to you, but that cannot be : forgive me, my dear cousin, if I
have pained you; farewell—God bless you."
Gertrude's heart swelled, and the tear started to her eye,
as she returned the affectionate pressure of her cousin's hand,
but she repressed her emotion
“ You will come again soon,” said she; but Lyndsay made
no reply, and they parted.
“I fear I have not done as I ought," thought Gertrude
with a sigh, but in another moment the thought was gone,
and she was seated by her lover. The equipage was perfect,

the day was beautiful, all was gaiety and brightness ; Colonel
Delmour was more than usually delightful, and Lyndsay was
forgotten.
CHAPTER LV.
some new
SEVERAL days passed in the same manner, and every day
scene of useless profusion was suggested by
Colonel Delmour, and adopted by the Countess. New stables
must be built to accommodate the additional number of horses
he declared to be absolutely necessary; the present billiard-
room was inconvenient, a new one would cost a mere trifle ;
there was no good music-room, and there was no living in the
country without a private theatre; the present library might
be turned into a conservatory, and the smooth green bank,
which sloped gradually down to the river, must be changed
into an Italian garden, with hanging terraces and marble
fountains, and he sketched a design of the whole so beautiful,
that the Countess was in ecstasies.
Mrs. St. Clair witnessed all this with very different feel-
ings; but she saw the ascendancy Colonel Delmour had
gained over her daughter was absolute, and she feared to
come to extremities with either of them, lest it should prove
the means of throwing her more completely into his power,
and he might prevail upon her to unite herself to him, not-
withstanding her promise to the contrary. She had remon-
strated with both on the impropriety of Colonel Delmour
continuing to reside at Rossville in the present situation of
the family; but her words produced no effect, till, at length,
finding she could not dislodge him, she formed the resolution
of taking Lady Rossville to London, as the best means of
detaching her in some degree from him. She thought of
Lyndsay's words too, “Let her see others no less gifted than
he is," and she thought it was not impossible that a change
might be wrought in Gertrude's sentiments; at least, there
was more likelihood of its being effected amidst the novelty
and variety of the metropolis, than in the romantic seclusion
of Rossville.
This resolution caused infinite chagrin to the lovers. To
Gertrude's young enthusiastic heart, all happiness seemed
centred in the spot which contained herself and the idol of
her affections; and although the mere inanimate objects of
nature-woods, rocks, water-are in themselves nothing, yet,
combined with the associations of fancy and memory, they
acquire a powerful hold upon our hearts. Every step to her

255
was fraught with fond ideas; for it was at Rossville her feel-
ings had been most powerfully excited, whether to joy or
sadness, and Rossville, its trees, its banks, its flowers, seemed
all entwined with her very existence. It is thus, when the
heart is exclusively occupied with one object, it clings with
fond tenacity to every circumstance connected with it.
“Ah, mamma," said she, with a sigh, “ how sad to think
of leaving Rossville, when it is just beginning to burst forth
in all its beauty; and to immure ourselves amidst the stone,
and lime, and smoke, and dust of London: do only look at
these almond trees and poplars.”
But Mrs. St. Clair put it on the footing of her health,
which required change of air and scene, and a consultation of
the London Faculty; and her daughter could say no more.
Colonel Delmour shared in her regrets; but his arose from
a different cause : bis heart was too worldly and sophisticated
to participate in those pure and simple pleasures which im.
parted such delight to hers. But he was aware of the ad-
miration Gertrude would excite when she made her appear-
ance in London; and he was unwilling that she should be
seen there until she should be introduced as his wife. He
thought too well of himself and her, to dread any rival in
her affections; but still the gay world was very unfavourable
to the growth of sentiment; there was a multiplicity of objects,
a diversity of amusements, a glare, a glitter and bustle, that
could not fail to distract her attention, and weaken the strength
of that exclusive attachment she now cherished for him; and,
selfish and engrossing as he was, he felt the charm would be
diminished, were the devotion lessened.
But, in his murmurs and repinings, Gertrude heard only the
same tender regrets which filled her own heart even to over-
flowing, and she loved him the more for this sympathy in her
feelings. The day before that on which they were to set off
was the Countess's birth-day, but she would not have it ob-
served.
“This day two years it shall be celebrated gaily, nobly, if
you will," said she.
“And must this one pass away like other vulgar hours,"
said Delmour, “unmarked by aught to distinguish it from
common days, without a single memorial to mark it ? Poor
that I am, I have not even the most trifling memento to lay at
"I will not tax you so unmercifully as did the ladies of old
their lovers," said the Countess, with a smile; “I want
neither a dragon's scale nor a hydra's head, nor even a glass
of singing-water, nor a branch of a talking-tree ; but you
your feet."

shall bring me, from the greenhouse, a rose unique, and
that shall be my only gaud to-day.”
Colonel Delmour brought the rose. Lady Rossville drew
from her finger a rare and costly gem which had belonged to
the late Earl.
“ Such tokens are but mere vulgar and oft-repeated em-
blems of an old story," said she, smiling, “ from Queen Eli-
zabeth and the Earl of Essex, down to the milkmaid and her
rush ring ;' but it will mark the day, will it not ? and if you
should turn rebel or I tyrant, you must choose some more
faithful messenger than poor Essex did : and that's all the
moral of my tale.”
“ Woe to the hand that shall ever seek to wear this while I
live !” exclaimed Delmour, as he pressed it to his lip, and
then placed it on his finger.
Lady Rossville's sole ornament when she appeared at dinner
was the rose unique; but the heat of the room caused it to
expand too quickly, and the leaves dropped suddenly away.
Happily my nurse could never succeed in making me
superstitious,” said she, in a low voice to Colonel Delmour,
" else I should have looked on this as some fatal omen."
“ The prodigy is,” answered he, with a smile, “that either
the rose unique has suddenly expired of envy at finding itself
so eclipsed by the wearer, or-that your gardener forces his
flowers too much."
“I fear the latter is the true cause," answered the Coun-
tess, laughing, "and it is my own fault, for I never have the
patience to wait the gradual growth of anything. I am for
everything starting into full-blown perfection at once."
“Yes, you say true,” said Mrs. St. Clair significantly, as
she caught her daughter's last words, "art seems to carry
the day with you in all things, Gertrude; 'tis well you are
beginning to discover your own foible."
Colonel Delmour bit his lip, and the Countess blushed with
wounded feeling as she bent her head to pick up some of the
scattered rose leaves.
CHAPTER LVI.
LADY ROSSVILLE's departure from the home of her fathers
called forth the regrets and the lamentations of the poor; for
although her attentions towards them had somewhat relaxed
since Colonel Delmour's arrival, yet she had done enough

257
under Lyndsay's auspices to render herself completely be-
loved by them. The various works, too, which she had begun,
all in the spirit of profuseness and self-gratification, contri-
buted for the present to her popularity, and she flattered her-
self that she was equally actuated by beneficence and huma-
nity, although they had taken a different direction under her
lover, from what they had done under her cousin's guidance.
She sent splendid rather than suitable gifts to her aunts and
her cousin Anne, and directed that the former should be con-
stantly supplied with the choicest of fruits and flowers from
Rossville. She felt unwilling to depart without sending some
remembrance to Lyndsay-some little token of her grati-
tude for all she owed him of generous interference-of time,
and trouble, and kindness hitherto but ill requited; yet she
feared to mention the subject before Colonel Delmour, aware
of the jealous irritability it might excite. At length the
thought struck her to send him a picture of his mother,
which was the most admired and conspicuous of any of the
family portraits. It was a Sir Joshua, and done at a time
when the subject was in all the graces of early beauty, and
the artist in all the fulness of his perfection. The picture
was, therefore, not merely precious as a portrait, but was va-
juable in itself, as most of that great master's works are, on
account of its own intrinsic beauty. “There is something of
Lyndsay in the half-melancholy, half-smiling expression of
those dark eyes," thought Gertrude, as she looked on the
picture ; "something, too, of his reproachful look," added she,
with a sigh, as her heart told her he had cause to reproach
her.
She wrote a few lines to accompany the picture, which was
to be packed and sent after she was gone ; and then, all being
arranged, she bade adieu to Rossville, and the tears stood in
her eyes as she looked on its budding woods and sparkling
waters in the soft rays of vernal sunshine.
Mrs. St. Clair had peremptorily refused permission to
Colonel Delmour to accompany them to London, and Ger-
trude had at once conceded that point to her mother. How-
ever much chagrined, he was therefore obliged to acquiesce,
and as his rate of travelling was rather more rapid than
theirs, he preceded them by several days, and (apprized by a
note from the Countess of their apr ach to the metropolis)
was at the hotel ready to receive them on their arrival.
The following day he brought his mother and sisters to in-
troduce them to Gertrude. She had anticipated the meeting
with that trepidation natural to one so situated, but her
timidity was soon dispelled by the pleasant social manners of
Lady Augusta, and the lively, good-humoured frankness of
17

her daughters. There was much to attract, and nothing to
be afraid of, and before they had been half an hour together,
Gertrude felt as though she were already one of themselves.
They were pressed to dine with Lady Augusta in Brook
Street, but Mrs. St. Clair declared herself too much fatigued
with the journey for such an exertion, and Gertrude resisted
their entreaties out of compliment to her mother. They
were, however, to meet the following day, when something
was to be fixed, and after much talking, and a great display of
affection on both sides between the cousins, they parted.
Even Mrs. St. Clair was more pleased with them than she
cared to admit to herself, for they had paid her more attention
than she was accustomed to receive, and had they not been
Colonel Delmour's mother and sisters she would have been
loud in her praises of them. Gertrude spoke of them to her
lover with all the warmth she felt, but he appeared but little
gratified by her commendations. " You do not seem suffi
ciently sensible how charming they are," said she ; "you did
not say half enough in their praise."
"I told you you would find Lady Augusta a very good-
looking, well-bred person, did I not ?" said he with a smile,
" and the girls very gay, and good-humoured, and very like
other girls."
“0, more than that! Lady Augusta is very delightful,
and your sisters, how much more agreeable they are, for in-
stance, than the Miss Millbanks."
“Are they? yes, by-the-bye, the Miss Millbanks are very
Scotch indeed; but all misses, Scotch or English, are pretty
much alike."
A house had been procured in Park Lane. Mrs. St. Clair
thought it too magnificent, and too expensive ; but Colonel
Delmour approved
of it, Lady Rossville admired it, and the
house was taken. Then came equipages, horses, liveries, in
short, an establishment, in which taste and splendour were
alone consulted, without any regard to the means, which in-
deed Gertrude herself believed to be inexhaustible, and which
Delmour, with the reckless-profusion of selfish extravagance,
thought not about at all. Since Lady Rossville was to ap-
pear in the world, his only anxiety was that she should at the
first take her place at the very head of the fashionable world :
aware, that if she once entered in an inferior grade she might
not afterwards, even as his wife, be able to attain the proud
pre-eminence of ton, which, of all pre-eminences, is the one
most esteemed in the great world.
“ Lady Augusta has kindly offered to introduce me to her
milliner and jeweller, and all sorts of useful people,” said
Gertrude to him one day ; "and in the evening she pro-

poses that mamma and I should accompany her to the
opera."
Colonel Delmour received this information rather dryly,
and seemed to hesitate in his reply. At last he said, “I have
a great respect for Lady Augusta's good sense and good inten-
tions ; but really her tradespeople are so perfectly antedilu-
vian, that you will oblige me by having nothing to do with
them."
Gertrude was disposed to take this as a joke, but that she
saw he was serious. “ Lady Augusta does not dress in good
taste," continued he; "and as for the girls, they can scarcely
be said to have a taste at all—they stick themselves over
with feathers, or flowers, or butterflies, or anything that
comes in their way. Emily rather carries it oft well ; but poor
Georgy looks as if her ornaments had actually been blown
“But how can I refuse so polite an offer ? and, besides, I
don't know who are the people to employ."
“Leave all that to me, or rather to a friend of mine, Lady
Charles Arabin, who comes to town to-morrow, and whom I
shall bring to visit you immediately." Seeing Gertrude look
surprised, he added, “She is not handsome, and is rather
passée ;' but she has the best air and taste of anybody in
town; in fact, she gives the ton at present to everything;
and, therefore, I would rather that you took her as your
guide, than Lady Augusta, that is, in all matters of mere
taste and fashion."
“ But I have a taste of my own in dress," said Lady Ross-
ville, half displeased at the idea of being obliged to submit to
the decision of another.
“ And a perfect one,” said Colonel Delmour; “but taste
alone won't do without fashion. Venus herself, even attired
by the Graces, would be thought 'maussade,' were she to be
introduced by a duchess who had been excluded from
Almack's, or who had never supped at D House."
“Then, who can value the blind admiration of the multi-
tude ?” said Gertrude ; "not I, indeed ; 'tis much too paltry
a triumph for me to take any trouble to acquire. I care not
a straw for such empty distinctions, and would rather have
the approbation of your mother, than of the whole fashion-
able world."
“What a word for you!" said Delmour, laughing. "Ap-
probation is a very good thing in itself, and a very useful
school-word; but for you, Gertrude, with your charms and
your graces to be approved of! No, you must be followed,
admired, adored, worshipped."
“I am afraid 'tis in your imagination alone I stand any

chance for being deified," said Gertrude, smiling ; " so I
shall certainly not start a candidate for immortal honours. I
am not ambitious, Delmour, and shall be satisfied with your
homage and true affections, since you will not allow me the
approbation of your family."
“But I am proud, and vain, and ambitious of and for you,
dearest Gertrude,” said Delmour, gaily, “and must not
suffer your partiality for me and my family to detract from
the brilliancy of your star."
“But I would rather be introduced by them than by any
one else ; if Lady Augusta does not mix much in society,
there is your aunt, the Duchess of Burlington.".
“ Worse and worse," cried Delmour.“I would rather you
never appeared at all, than have you brought out by her.”
" Why so ?” asked Gertrude in some surprise. “Is she
not respectable ?"
Colonel Delmour could scarcely preserve his gravity at the
question, as he replied—“Respectability, like approbation, is
a thing of no account here; it gives no consequence whatever
to its possessor."
“Then, what precious gifts of nature, or acquirements of
art, are they which do give consequence in this magic circle
of yours ? " said the Countess.
"That nameless je ne sais quoi' which all admire, but
none can define, and which unfortunately my highly respect-
able relations want. The Duchess is an excellent person in
her way, but she is antiquated in her notions, dresses shock-
ingly, gives parties where I should blush to be detected, and
I should be undone were I to be seen offering her my arm in
public.”
This was said in a sportive manner, which made Gertrude
look upon it as a jest.
" Then I may scarcely expect to be acknowledged by you
to-night,” said she, in the same tone. "Perhaps it would be
your ruin also were you to be seen in Lady Augusta's box
talking to, or, it may be, handing out a Scotch cousin."
Colonel Delmour looked grave.
“ You will really oblige me,” said he, “if you will decline
going into public for a day or two; although I have been
talking mere nonsense on the subject, yet, I do assure you, a
first introduction is of more consequence than you at present
are aware of.”
“ Consequence !" repeated Gertrude, contemptuously; "if
I am not entitled to be of consequence on my own account, I
certainly do not wish to derive it from Lady Charles Arabin.”
“ You mistake the matter entirely, dearest Gertrude; I
am desirous you should appear with that effect which you are

so well entitled to produce, but which you will derive much
more from your beauty and your grace than from your rank.
I cannot exactly make one so unsophisticated as you compre-
hend the arbitrary and capricious mechanism of the fashion-
able world."
No, pray do not attempt it. I am sure I shall never be
fashionable. Ah! Delmour, it was not thus we talked and
felt at dear Rossville! What was the world to us there ?"
• Would to Heaven we were there now !” said Delmour,
echoing her sigh ; " but you mistake me, Gertrude ; it is not
that I place the world in competition with you, but that I
abhor the thoughts of your preference for me lowering you
in the slightest degree. You have everything that entitles
you to take the first place in the best society ; but, absurd as
it seems, I must candidly confess to you, that my family,
although high in rank and fair in character, cannot do you
justice in that respect. I keep clear of all that sort of thing;
but if once you get into their circle, you will be shackled
eternally with bad parties and acquaintances that will keep
all the best people aloof; for instance, Lady Augusta would
introduce the girls into the Burlington set; the consequence
is, they are eternally followed by men with whom I don't
associate ; in short, secondary men, whom they are forced to
smile on faute de mieux;' but that must not be with you,
Gertrude; you have alrcady given up too much for me; do
not, as you love me, add yet more to the self-reproach I
sometimes feel for having suffered you to sacrifice so much.”
“The feeling is a generous, a noble one; but I cannot help
thinking it a mistaken one," said the Countess ; “but, since
you are so scrupulous, I shall yield the point; make me then
what
you will, only pray don't make me a fine lady."
Colonel Delmour was all rapture and gratitude, and only
left her to go and inform his mother, that Lady Rossville had
caught cold, and was unable to fulfil her engagements ; his
sisters visited her in the course of the day, and Gertrude
blushed with shame as she attempted to confirm the false-
hood.
"I half suspect," said Georgiana, laughing, “that Master
Fred. has been telling you that mamma is not fashionable ;
he is so admired and recherché' himself, that we think he
gives himself airs ; so, pray don't encourage him, or you
will spoil him entirely."
“ It is so provoking," said Miss Emily, “that he won't
allow you to go with us; for, I can see, it is he that prevents
you from going with us to Kitchner's this morning, he has
some such exquisite things just now! things really to die
fur !" with a deep sigh.

“Since that is the case," said Gertrude, smiling, “I am
fortunate in having escaped the danger: but, if you are not
afraid to encounter it, you shall each of you choose something
for me, according to your own taste, and then I shall see how
far we agree.”
“How happy you must be, who can afford to choose what
you like !" said both sisters, sorrowfully.
“For to-day, I devolve my happiness upon you," said Lady
Rossville ; "only remember to choose exactly what you
should like for yourselves.”
The sisters departed, delighted with the commission,
and not without some latent suspicion as to the result of
their choice, which was verified by each receiving the
very handsome and expensive articles of jewellery they had
selected.
CHAPTER LVII.
PERHAPS no woman ever heard another highly commended
by her lover, without feeling, at least, a slight sensation of
pique and jealousy, and something of this sort Gertrude had
begun to cherish against Lady Charles Arabin before she
saw her. She was, therefore, prepared to receive her with
something of the air and manner with which a pretty spoiled
child might be supposed to welcome its governess; and,
unknown to herself, there was a 'tournure of the head, a
colour on the cheek, a slight pout on the lip, when that lady
and Colonel Delmour were announced together. But the
first glance at Lady Charles instantly dispelled all her fears
and thick-coming fancies ; as she beheld (what in common
life would be called) a middle-aged woman, without any
pretensions to beauty, beyond a tolerably regular set of
features, and a figure, which, though evidently of a fine
structure, was thin, almost to meagreness. Her dress was
striking without being singular, her manners were quiet,
but perfectly elegant, and the 'tout ensemble conveyed that
impression of high birth and high breeding, which is some-
thing too subtle and refined to be described or analysed ;
something of so delicate and impalpable a nature, that it
might sometimes escape notice altogether, but for the effect
it produces upon others. Gertrude had never felt that her
mother was vulgar, till she contrasted the florid pomposity of
her manner with the ease, grace, and simplicity of Lady
Charles Arabin ; she spoke little, and there was nothing in
her conversation beyond the frivolous chit-chat of the day;
but her voice and accent were both fine, and she skimmed

263
over subjects with an airy lightness, that would have baffled
anything like discussion, even had any one been so inclined.
She invited Gertrude to take a drive with her, to which
she readily acceded, notwithstanding Mrs. St. Clair's
manifest displeasure, which, however, she did not venture
to express,
That lady was considerably annoyed by the manners of
Lady Charles, which made her feel her own as something
unwieldy and overgrown-like a long train, they were both
out of the way and in the way, and she did not know very
well how to dispose of them. Indeed, few things can be
more irritating than for those, who have hitherto piqued
themselves upon the abundance of their manner, to find all
at once that they have a great deal too much, that no one
is inclined to take it off their hands, and that, in short, it is
dead stock.
Lady Charles took leave, but Gertrude stopped a moment
in the drawing-room behind her companions, to say a few
coaxing words to her mother; then, as she hurried to over-
take them, she heard Lady Charles say, as in answer to some
remark of Colonel Delmour, “She is perfect !" and she
blushed as she caught the meaning glance he turned to
cast upon her. Much was done in the way of shopping; a
variety of splendid dresses were ordered, a great deal of
bijouterie was purchased, and Gertrude was whirled from
place to place, and from shop to shop, till her head was
almost turned with the varied and bustling scenes, in which
she was acting, for the first time, a part.
It is not at first that London either astonishes or delights.
It is too vast and too complicated to be taken in all at once
either by the eye or the mind; and it requires a little
schooling to enjoy even the variety and the brilliancy of its
pleasures, as they flash in rapid and never-ceasing succession
on the bewildered senses. Lady Rossville, like all novices,
felt something of this; and she sighed for the peaceful
romantic seclusion of her own domain, where she was all in
all, and where her lover was all to her. But it is not the
young and admired who can stand long on the brink of
pleasure, indulging their own sentimental reveries; and
Gertrude, with all her feeling, and romance, and enthusiasm,
was soon in the vortex of elegant dissipation.
Borne like a feather on the tide of fashionable celebrity,
she was hurried along she knew not whither; while at the
same time, wherever she went, she was hailed as the leader
of every favourite folly. She was the idol of the day, and
she breathed only in an atmosphere of adulation, baleful
alike in its effects on the head and the heart. Amidst the

She now gave
delusions of the senses, she forgot everything save her lover;
but even when all looks were turned upon her, as the magnet
of the glittering throng, it was in his eyes only that she
sought to read her triumph. Although her engagement with
Colonel Delmour was pretty generally understood, and he
had all the bearing of the accepted lover, still that did not
prevent others from entering the lists; but, on the contrary,
was rather an additional attraction; and men far superior to
himself in rank and station, and some of them not much his
inferior in personal endowments, had declared themselves
her lovers. But even Delmour, jealous and irritable as he
was, felt that he had no cause to dread a rival in her affec-
tions. Mr. Delmour and she had only met once, and that at
a formal dinner at the Duke of Burlington's, where they had
merely exchanged the common courtesies of acquaintance-
ship. He was evidently of the family school; the Duke and
Duchess being formal, dull personages, living in a vast and
stately mansion, amidst a profusion of magnificent heir-looms
of every description.
herself
up with greater zest than ever to the
round of frivolous occupations and amusements, which form
the sole business of so many an immortal being's existence,
and which are no less fascinating to the unreflecting mind,
than they are vain and unsatisfying to the eye of reason and
experience. It was to no purpose that Mrs. St. Clair remon-
strated, and threatened, and denounced-her power was
gone ; she never had possessed the affection of the daughter,
and she had now lost the control of authority. Besides, the
Countess afforded her little time or opportunity to expatiate
on her extravagances ; she lived in such an unceasing whirl,
that Mrs. St. Clair had in vain strove to keep pace with her.
She had been obliged to relinquish the attempt; their hours
did not keep time, and their engagements were in opposite
spheres ; each had their apartments—their carriages-their
society; and Gertrude felt satisfied that her mother had all
these things, and was also noticed by, and indeed in habits of
intimacy with, Colonel Delmour's family. Her own morn-
ings were spent in sitting to half the sculptors and painters
in town for busts and pictures, in all possible variety, to
please the fastidious taste of her lover; in riding in the park
with him, or in shopping with Lady Charles, or some other
frivolous idler; in the evening, there were dinners, and
parties, and balls, and operas, and concerts, in such quick
succession, as left her scarcely conscious of having been at
one before she found herself at some other.
“ Confess this is to live,” said Delmour to her one evening,
as he led her from one gay multitude, where she had been

265
the admired of all admirers, to another, where her appear-
ance would excite an equal sensation.
“All that is wanting,” replied she with a smile, “is time
to feel one's enjoyment; but I can scarcely tell whether
I chase pleasure, or it chases me, or whether we are running
a race, or, in short, how we go on together.”
“ Take a ride with me to-morrow in the Park, and we
shall go at a sober foot-pace, that you may have time to find
out,” said Delmour.
“But to-morrow I give Lawrence another sitting-
“Take the ride first, and you will go to him with a bloom
that will make him burn his pallet.”
79
CHAPTER LVIII.
The Countess smiled a consent, and Colonel Delmour was at
her breakfast table the following morning..., A salver stood
upon it covered with cards, notes, letters, bills, petitions, and
memoranda of every description. She carelessly tossed over
some, opened and glanced over others, while she listened at
the same time to her lover, as he red the record of her tri-
umphs in the Morning Post. At length, as she discovered
some post letters amid the heap, she drew back her hand,
and, with a shudder, exclaimed,
“Ah! these ugly letters !"
“What letters ?” inquired Delmour, as he, at the same
time, drew the stand towards himself."01 some Scotch
parish business ; is that all?"
“ Lectures from my guardians, and tiresome explanations
from my steward, are the best I have to expect. I had a
letter from him t'other day, telling me the school-house was
stopped for want of money."
"How very distressing?” said Colonel Delmour, with an
ironical smile ;—" then you will have no long, lean, grey,
weeping-looking building, with its steep, straight roof, and
its little green glass windows, and its shoals of hoddy-doddy,
white-haired, blubbered boys and girls. I hope it was to
have formed a vista in the park; it would have been what is
called, I believe, a most gratifying sight.".
“You are very kind to try to reconcile me to myself by
treating it so slightly; but I feel I have been to blame; I
have been too expensive.”
"In what respect?”.
“In everything—this service, for instance," pointing to

the magnificent breakfast service of richly-chased antique
plate and Sevres china—“I am shocked to think how much
it cost."
“Why delft, to be sure, would have been cheaper—and,
to the philosophic eye, a pewter basin is as becoming, per-
haps, as a silver one; 'tis a pity you did not consult me in.
stead of Lady Charles about it."
"Lady Charles is certainly very extravagant," said the
Countess, gravely.
“Not more so than others in her rank. Lord Charles has
a good fortune, and allows her to spend it, which she does in
supporting her station in society. Methodists and misers, I
believe, are for abolishing all these distinctions, and building
conventicles, and endowing hospitals with their money."
“One of these letters, I perceive, is from Lyndsay," said
Gertrude, with another sigh.
“Which you seem afraid even to look upon. Shall I open
it for you ?"
"Do-but first give Zoe a few of these strawberries."
Colonel Delmour read the letter aloud ; it was short and
hurried, and the purport of it was communicating the sudden
death of the parish minister of Rossville, by which means
the Countess would have it in her power to provide for young
Leslie, who had just been with him bespeaking his good
offices.
“Who is this Leslie who finds such a patron in Lyndsay?"
inquired Colonel Delmour.
“He is a very interesting young man, who is engaged to
my cousin, Anne Black, and the want of a church has hitherto
been the only obstacle to the marriage. How happy it makes
me to have it in my power to remove it. Pray, reach me my
writing stand, and I shall settle that sur-le-champ.?”
But instead of obeying, Delmour took the hand she had
impatiently extended, and said, -
Is it possible, my dear Gertrude, you can be serious in
this? Can you really think, for a moment, of having your
relations placed so near you in so inferior a situation? Only
consider, the manse is almost close by the gate—that is of
little consequence with people who have no claim upon you ;
but really the Countess of Rossville and her cousin, the
minister's wife, thus brought in contact, there is confusion in
the thought."
Lady Rossville looked displeased, then said, "My cousin
is a person I never can feel ashamed of.'
“Not as she is; but as she will be when she degenerates
into the minister's wife with her printed gown and black mit-
tens, with a troop of half-licked cubs of children at her heels,

267
and the minister himself, honest man! at their head, with his
lank locks, and his customary suit of rusty blacks, all coming
to visit, perchance to dine with, their cousin the Countess!"
“If you are ashamed of my relations, you ought to have
said so sooner," said Gertrude, struggling with her emotion;
as it is, it is not yet too late-
"Dearest Gertrude, how seriously you take my badinage;
but you must be sensible that, where the difference of rank
and station is so great between near relations, the local affi-
nity had as well not be quite so close ; your own good sense
and delicate perception must point out to you the inevitable
désagréments' that must ensue; the slights that will be felt;
the offences that will be taken; the affronts that will be
imagined."
My cousin is not a person of that sort,” said Gertrude ;
"and, I am sure, her near vicinity would be a source of great
pleasure to me. I like her society, and should have her often
with me."
“You may at present; but, be assured, that could not pos-
sibly continue ; you must move in such different spheres, and
must associate with such different people, that 'tis impossible
that you could act or think alike: for instance, you told me
that the Duchess of Arlingham, the Arabins, Lady Peverley,
Mrs. Beechey, and I know not all who, had promised to
pay you a visit at Rossville this summer, and to take part in
your theatricals, if you can have the theatre ready: how do
you suppose the minister and his wife could relish, or be re-
lished by, those of your
friends ?"
“But I am in a manner pledged to my cousin."
“ Not for this church, surely?”.
“No; not for this one in particular ; but I repeatedly as-
sured her that, whenever I had it in my power, I would be-
friend her, and now it is so
“ Dearest Gertrude, it is not in your power, that is, if I
possess that influence with you I have hitherto flattered my-
self I did ; on that faith, in the transaction I had lately with
Harry Monteith relating to my exchange into the Guards, I
ventured to promise that the first church that was in your
gift, as the phrase is, you would—that is-I would engage
your interest in behalf of his old tutor; quite a charity case,
as he represented it; a married man with a large family, and
I forget all the particulars; but, at the time, it struck me as
a thing that would interest you.”
Lady Rossville's colour rose during this speech, and for
some moments she remained silent, as if struggling with her
feelings ; at last she said, “You have taken a strange liberty,
it seems, and one which I cannot easily pardon."

At that moment a servant entered to say her Ladyship's
horses were at the door.
“Desire them to be put up; I shall not ride to-day,” said
she, and taking up Lyndsay's letter, she quitted the room,
leaving Delmour too much piqued, as well as surprised at
this display of spirit, to make any attempt to detain her. He,
however, lounged a considerable time at the breakfast-table,
expecting her return, tossed over all the litter of new publi-
cations, and music, and expensive toys that lay scattered
about ; touched her harp to ascertain whether it were in tune,
and broke two of the strings; stirred the fire, although the
room was suffocating; thén threw open a window, exclaiming
at the smell of a tuberose ; but still Gertrude did not re-
turn, carriage after carriage was sent from the door, and even
Lady Charles was not admitted. At length his patience being
exhausted, he wrotem"Dearest Gertrude, see me but for one
moment as you love me," and ringing the bell, he desired it
might be conveyed to Lady Rossville. A verbal answer was
returned; her ladyship was sorry she was particularly en-
gaged, and Delmour, too proud to sue any further, left the
house in a transport of indignation.
CHAPTER LIX.
GERTRUDE, too, was proud in her way, and her feelings had
been severely wounded. She had already become sufficiently
fine to be able to feel, in some degree, the truth of what Del-
mour had said in regard to her relations; but she was piqued
that he should have been the person to force so disagreeable
a conviction upon her-he who had so often declared that she
was all the universe to him; and whose favourite maxim it
was, that love could see no defects in aught pertaining to the
object beloved. Why was it, then, that he was become so
clear-sighted as thus to anticipate these paltry feelings of
wounded vanity, and to have presumed so far already as to
have usurped her power, to have promised away in her name,
without leave asked or obtained, a gift of so much importance
one which she might have had a pleasure in conferring at
his solicitation, but which it would be weakness to allow to be
thus taken from her ? “Lyndsay would not have acted
thus !” thought she, as she looked at his letter, and a tear
dropped upon it. She leant her head upon her hand, and for
the first time since her arrival in London, fell into a train of
reflection, from which she only roused herself to begin an

_" when
answer to his letter. But she had only got as far as -“ My
dear cousin,-I am happy to have it in my power-
Colonel Delmour's billet was brought to her. She read it,
and wavered.—“No, I will not see him," thought she proudly,
at_this triumph over her already returning tenderness.
“But I will not finish my letter to Lyndsay till to-morrow-
one day can make no difference, and 'tis almost time to go to
Lawrence's." She rang, and ordered the carriage, then
drove to Lady Augustaʼs to get one of the girls to accompany
her. As they drove along, Delmour passed on horseback,
and merely bowed, with an air of lofty respect.
“Fred. seems to be on his high horse to-day,” said Miss
Georgina, laughing ; " I told you he would give himself airs;
but”-looking after him—"he certainly is the handsomest
man in town, and unquestionably the most admired and imi-
tated. Apropos, have you seen the Duchess of St. Ives ?
I hear she has already doffed her weeds, and come out in all
her glory. Delmour was an admirer of hers, you must know,
in her married state; at least, so the ill-natured world said.
I know she is desperately in love with him, and I believe,
would marry him to-morrow if he would ask her; so she
will be ready to poison you, or pierce you to the heart, per-
haps, with a bodkin, as the ladies in old ballads used to do
their rivals."
There certainly was nothing in this that ought to have grati-
fied a mind in a right state of feeling; it was food for a per-
verted taste only, but how often are the passions and the pre-
judices gratified at the expense of the principles! Gertrude's
vanity was pleased to hear her lover praised, and her pride
was piqued to show her triumph over the Duchess of St.
Ives.
These two ladies had met, exchanged cards, and graced each
other's parties, but a mutual and instinctive sort of antipathy
had, from the first, existed between them. They were both
young, beautiful, distinguished, and independent; rivals in
celebrity and extravagance, Gertrude learnt for the first time
that they were also rivals in love, and a momentary pang shot
across her breast at the discovery. But hers was not a na-
ture to harbour jealous fears, and she soon dismissed them.
“No," thought she, “whatever Delmour's faults may be,
I should wrong him were I to doubt his love and truth ;''
and she recollected some slighting and satirical remarks he
had made upon the Duchess the evening before. She, there-
fore, listened with complacency, while Miss Delmour rattled
away about the Duchess—her beauty-her pride-her parties
- her diamonds—her jointure-her independence of all con-
trol--and, to sum up the whole, she concluded with a sigh-

THE INHERITANCE.
“Do you know, I never see the Duchess of St. Ives that I
do not wish I had been born a widow."
When Gertrude returned home it was in the secret hope
of hearing that Colonel Delmour had called during her ab-
sence.
66 He
“ Has anybody called since I went out ?" inquired she of
her porter, as she entered the hall.
“O, surely, my Lady !” replied he, in some surprise at
such a question, as he pointed to a pile of cards.
" No one else ?” as she tossed them over with an air of
chagrin.
“No, my Lady !" in the same tone of amazement at being,
for the first time, so strictly interrogated on the duties of his
office.
may have called, although that stupid man has forgot
to mention it,” thought she; and he will probably call
again; it is not very late. Those French clocks and watches
are always wrong," as they told a different tale ; "it cannot be
more than seven."
But just then Mrs. St. Clair entered, and the mother and
the daughter exchanged their morning salutations. The
former was going to the theatre, as it was one of her greatest
enjoyments to patronise a large party of secondary people,
by whom she was looked up to with that respect, which
money and consequence will always procure from one set, if
not from another. She expressed her astonishment at finding
her daughter seated at her harp in her morning dress, and
the Countess, hastily rising, said she was just going to com-
mence her toilette ; " But I dine with Lady Peverley, who is
always late.”
" And then, what else ?” asked Mrs. St. Clair.
" Then, I believe, I shall go to the opera with Lady
Charles, and I shall, perhaps, just look in for half an hour at
the Duchess of Arlington's.".
“ You are killing yourself, Gertrude--absolutely killing
yourself--you look wretchedly; I must put a stop to this ;
we must leave this town."
“ We shall talk of that to-morrow, mamma; good-bye,”
cried the Countess, as she flew away to her dressing-room,
anxious to avoid all unpleasant discussion.
She half expected to meet Colonel Delmour at dinner, but
she was mistaken. At all events, there could not be a doubt
of seeing him at the opera, and to the opera she went with
Lady Charles, escorted by two or three men distingués.'
But Delmour was not there, and she watched the opening of
every box, to see whether he would not yet enter.
Nor was Delmour at the Duchess of Arlington's. Lady

Charles expressed her astonishment at not finding him in any
of his usua) haunts, and Gertrude disclaimed all knowledge
of his proceedings with as much indifference as she could
“He is probably at the Duchess of St. Ives'," said Lady
Stanley; she has a musical party, I believe, to-night.”.
Again the Countess found the heat insupportable, and her
casy good-humoured chaperon left the party with her as soon
as her carriage could be got.
Gertrude returned home, wearied in body, and wretched in
mind. All the worst qualities of her nature had been called
forth and excited during the day; resentment, envy, pride,
jealousy, had all been felt, and some of their leaven stilí
wrought in her breast. “Oh, how I hate myself, and how
hideous I look !" thought she, as she glanced at herself in a
mirror. “Is this pleasure ? Ah, how different from the
sweet serene days I passed at Rossville ! but there I was not
the vain, foolish, fantastic thing I am here. Lyndsay was
right when he told me I should never find my happiness in
what the world calls pleasure !” and the admired and envied
Lady Rossville owned for the time, that to be admired was
but vanity; and to be envied, but vexation of spirit.
CHAPTER LX.
LIKE all those who are the slaves of their feelings, Lady
Rossville found she must fly to one extreme or other ; she
must either shut herself up in her chamber, and refuse to be
comforted, or she must plunge still deeper into the whirlpool
of folly and extravagance to drown thought. As persons in
a similar state of mind generally do, she chose both evils ;
she first wept the bitter tears of jealousy and mortification,
then ordered her carriage, and, throwing on a veil, drove
away to Lady Charles Arabin, to get her assistance in
choosing some dresses and jewels.
"I may as well order the furniture I want for Rossville
too," said she to herself. " I shall be there very soon
now ;” and the tears again sprang to her eyes, as Rossville
and all its tender recollections rose to her mind ; but she
strove to put them down with the splendid plans she tried to
busy her imagination about.
On being ushered into Lady Charles's drawing-room, she
found her surrounded by gentlemen, children, and dogs, and
the bustle of her first entrance prevented her all at once from

recognising Colonel Delmour amongst the number, and when
she did, a mutual bow was the only acknowledgment.
One by one the idlers dropped off, the children were sent
to dinner, and only Lady Charles and her two friends
remained. Gertrude then made her request, to which she
acceded, adding,
“ Though, as I have got a little cold to-day, and your
carriage is open, I must wrap up; so, pray, don't tire
to death, if I should be ten minutes at my toilette ; " and,
with a smile, she disappeared.
Silence ensued. Gertrude carefully avoided looking in the
direction where Delmour was, lest he should construe it into
an appeal to him; and she almost feared to breathe, lest he
should imagine she had spoken. She flattered herself she
was the very emblem of indifference and abstraction ; but
even through the folds of her veil, Delmour marked, with
secret triumph, her quivering lip and tearful eyes. At length
this state became too painful to be endured. She rose with
the intention of passing into the adjoining drawing-room,
when Delmour, approaching her with an air of agitation,
said,
“ Although I should not have presumed to seek an inter-
view with Lady Rossville in her own house again, after having
been once turned from it, yet I cannot allow the present
opportunity to pass without making an attempt to obtain from
her justice what I have now little hope of owing to her ten-
derness." He stopped in emotion ; but Gertrude felt her
tears ready to spring forth, and made no reply. 66 All I ask
is, that you would hear what I have to offer in excuse for my
conduct, rash and unwarrantable as it must appear to you,
until, in some degree, explained.”
“I was wrong," said Lady Rossville, summoning all her
pride to her aid ; “the step you had taken was one of
so extraordinary nature, that I certainly ought to have heard
what
you
had to offer in vindication of it."
This was a more prompt and spirited reply than Colonel
Delmour had reckoned upon, and, for a moment or two, he
was silent and disconcerted. He then said,-
“I find I have mistaken your character, or rather I have
judged it by my own. Had I been master of the universe,
my pride, my happiness would have been, that the object of
my love should, from the moment I loved, be the partner
also of my power, be it what it might; but your sentiments
are different from mine, it seems."
“I, too, should have had a pleasure in sharing the gifts of
fortune, whatever they were," said the Countess ; “but to
have them wrested from me.

“But I never sought to wrest them from you,” said Del-
mour, with earnestness ; “though, being rather rough and
blunt in speech, I perhaps did not go so wooingly to work as
some one more designing would have done. I told you, too
briefly perhaps, the simple truth, that, at your wish, I had
used every means to get myself exchanged into the Guards ;
but it was a matter of difficulty, and—why should I scruple
to own it ?-of expense, too, beyond my means ; but this
I was too proud to own to you, and I have been punished for
it; in short, not to bore you with tiresome business detail,
Monteith proposed that I should engage to-to use my
influence with you to provide for this old tutor of his, who is
a sort of dead weight upon the family; and I, in the belief
that I was—pardon my presumption-gratifying you, foolishly
enough pledged myself to that effect.'
“Nay more, that you would obtain it," said Lady Rossville,
still struggling against betraying her tenderness.
“ Perhaps I did, in the sanguine hope, that when the time
came for fulfilling my promise, I should then have acquired
greater influence with you than I can flatter myself I now
possess. But that hope is at an end. However disgraceful
it may be to fail in my promise, disgrace itself could scarce
be more intolerable than the misery I have endured under
your displeasure."
“ And yet you could sing with the Duchess of St. Ives ?”
said Gertrude, reproachfully, while her cheek flushed, and
the tear swelled to the very brim.
“Did I? It may be so, for I can scarcely tell what I have
done for the last four-and-twenty hours. Yes; now I recol-
lect Lord Westerton forcing me to her house, and being
compelled to sing with her something or other-I forget
what-that I used, I believe, to sing with her before the
flood ; that is, when I rather admired her bravura style of
beauty and of singing ; but these days are past never to
return."
Gertrude's tears, hitherto with difficulty restrained, now
dropped from her eyes; but they were tears of joy and ten-
derness. Ah, Delmour !” said she, as she gave him her
hand, we have both been to blame ; you have been rash,
and I hasty; but you shall keep your promise." She rose,
and placed herself at a writing-table. “What is the name of
the person you wish to befriend ? ” asked she, as she began to
write; but she sighed as the name of William Leslie pre-
sented itself to her mind's eye. Colonel Delmour could not
tell the name; but she wrote a few lines, engaging to bestow
the church and living of Rossville upon

for some time refused to receive it; but at length the Countess
prevailed, and he consented to keep his promise at the expense
of hers.
Still Gertrude did not feel happy ; but the usual panacea
was applied, viz. squandering money in dissipating thought.
Colonel Delmour was of the shopping party, and encouraged
her in every expensive whim. The most magnificent orders
were given for furnishing Rossville with all possible expe-
dition; and, to crown her transient delusive pleasure, when
they met the Duchess of St. Ives, Delmour's only salutation
to her was a distant bow.
“Do you go to her assembly to-night?" inquired the
Countess of her lover.
“Not unless to accompany you.”.
“ Then, pray, don't, dear Lady Rossville,” said Lady
Charles, who was of the opposite faction to the Duchess.
“Do, both of you, come and dine quietly with Arabin and
me. My cold is really too bad to admit of my going out in an
evening; and, you know, we never give dinners, so we shall
be a party quarré;' no bad thing, sometimes."
Gertrude consented, and the quiet evening was passed
partly in arranging a ball to be given by her, and partly in
losing fifty guineas to Lord Charles at ecarté.
“What an odd jumble of a day this has been !" thought
she, as she laid her head on her pillow; "and yet I have had
a great deal of pleasure in it, too;" but she sighed as she said
it, for not all the delusions of her own heart, or the blandish-
ments of her lover, could stifle the voice of conscience, or
conceal from her that she had acted unjustly and un-
wisely.
“What shall I say to Lyndsay ?” was the first thought
that presented itself the following morning; but, by the time
she was dressed, she heard Delmour's well-known knock.
" I fear I shall not have leisure to write to him to-day,"
said she, as she hastened to receive her lover, glad of the
excuse for delaying the irksome task. Then came the
strenuous idleness” of the day, most unremittingly perse-
vered in for many successive days, till at length it became too
late to think of writing at all. It would be better now to wait
till she returned to Rossville, she could explain the matter
80 much better in person than she could do by letter. Alas!
she took not into account (how few of the great and the gay
do !) the thought of that "hope deferred,” which “maketh
the heart sick," and which was experienced in all its inten-
sity, as post after post arrived, and brought no tidings for
those whose happiness hung upon her word.

stained Lady Rossville's cheek as she beheld her cousin's
handwriting; but she opened all her trifling billets, and read
all her cards and newspapers, and pampered her dog and
made her bullfinch pipe to her, but still she could not find
leisure to break the seal of her cousin's letter! Her mind
was now averse to exert itself upon anything that did not
bring some semblance of pleasure along with it; and it was
not so much the want of leisure as the utter inability to em-
ploy what she had to any useful purpose that thus bereft her
of all self-command and power of action.
CHAPTER LXI.
MEANWHILE the day of the ball arrived, and even in the
greatest of great houses a ball causes more or less of confusion
and commotion. Mrs. St. Clair had in vain remonstrated against
it. Her remonstrances, indeed, were rather reproaches, as the
cards had been issued before she had ever been consulted, and
the preparations, made upon the most splendid scale, had all
been arranged by the Countess and Colonel Delmour, aided
by some of their friends. They were to come early to assist
her in receiving the company, and she was dressed and her
apartments lighted in due time. She walked through them
with almost childish delight. All was light, and flowers, and
perfume, and her own figure, radiant in beauty and pleasure,
flashed upon her in all directions from the magnificent mir-
rors as they gave back the brilliant scene in almost endless
succession. She had stopped at one of them to alter some-
thing about her hair when in the long vista she perceived the
servant ushering in a gentleman, who she immediately con-
cluded must be Delmour. She turned round to meet him
with a smile, but, to her amazement, she beheld not her
lover, but her guardian, Lyndsay!
“Mr. Lyndsay ! my dear cousin !” exclaimed she; but
there was more of surprise than pleasure in the accent in
which the words were uttered ; "how-where have you
dropped from—the moon ?"
"No, dear Gertrude,” said he, as he affectionately shook
her hand ; "you have given me a long journey, but not
quite so long a one as that I come from Scotland.
“From Scotland l" repeated Lady Rossville, in some con-
fusion, as her conscience smote her at the sound; 66 and how
long have you been in town ?"
* Only since the morning—that is, my morning, which, I

suppose,
is your daybreak; for I called-such is my vulgarity
-about noon, and was told my lady was not up. I left my
card, and called again at three, when I was told my lady had
just gone out; and here I am now, it seems, just in time for
my lady's balí.”
“ Will you, indeed, stay?" cried Gertrude, rather at a loss
to ascertain whether he were in jest or earnest; “ that will
add so much to my pleasure that is, I-but, indeed, I never
heard you had called, and I forgot to look over my cards this
morning."
“Is that all you have forgot, Gertrude ?" inquired Lynd-
say, in a somewhat reproachful tone.
“ I fear not," said she, with a smile and a blush, the one
was forced, the other natural; “ but this is not the time for
me to remember all I have forgot."
“When is the time, then, Gertrude ?"
O, any time, you know, that—that any morning-
“Any morning sometimes means no day, does it not ?" said
Lyndsay. “But I have come far on purpose to see you, and
to talk with you, since you will not write to me, and I
must know when you will be disengaged."
“Spoken like a guardian, indeed !" said the Countess,
with an affected laugh ; " but since you must know, I must
candidly confess that I really cannot, at this precise moment,
recollect what my engagements are. To-morrow I know I
made a party to go to Richmond by water to breakfast. I wish
to get out of the way of the debris of to-night.”
"And what follows ?"
“Why, we shall probably dine there, and return in the
evening, when I have several engagements.”
“ And the day after to-morrow-can I see you then ? "
“What day is that? Friday. I rather think-yes, in-
deed, I remember now I engaged to give Tournerelli a sitting
at a very early hour, and as I forgot once before, if I fail this
time he will certainly make a Gorgon or a Medusa of me.
But you will join our party to Richmond to-morrow, and then
we can talk it all over-pray do.”
Lyndsay sighed. “Ah, Gertrude, what changed days
since those we passed at Rossville together! I little thought
then
you
would have grudged half an hour from your plea-
sures to bestow upon your friend !"
" You surely would not have me break my engagements ?”
said the Countess, with some pique.
“On the contrary, it was to remind you of them that
chiefly brought me here,” said Lyndsay mildly, but gravely;
“but I would have you choose the lesser evil—that which
will give least pain to others. Your gay friends will not break

THE INHERITANCE.
277
their hearts, I dare say, although you should disappoint them
to-morrow; but there are others, Gertrude, with whom you
have made engagements of more consequence, and whose
happiness is in your hands—it is for them I would intercede.”
Lady Rossville coloured deeply, and rising said, “It will
have rather a ridiculous effect for you and I to be found sit-
ting here in grave debate, discussing our parish business in the
ball-room : the place is, at least, as ill chosen as the time,”
added she somewhat haughtily, as she moved away. For a
moment Lyndsay seemed too much hurt to reply, but recol-
lecting, himself he said, -
Upon my own account I certainly would not intrude
where I am evidently so unwelcome, but I have undertaken
a task which I must perform ; I have engaged to remind Lady
Rossville of her promise, and, more, to get that promise ful-
filled.”
The Countess remained silent, but her countenance be-
trayed the agitation of her mind. At that moment the
knocker sounded an alarm.
“ You have refused to fix an hour to see me," said Lynd-
say, “I will therefore name one to wait upon you-to-morrow
at one I will be here."
Gertrude made no reply, but hurried forward to receive
Lady Charles, Colonel Delmour, and a succession of friends,
who now came pouring in.
Delmour's astonishment at sight of Lyndsay could only be
equalled by his dissatisfaction, and the meeting on both sides
was cold and distant. Mrs. St. Clair now made her appear-
ance, Lady Augusta and her daughters followed, and Lyndsay
was soon overwhelmed with expressions of surprise and plea-
sure from all quarters, but he contrived to disengage himself
from them and disappeared.
“Lyndsay has been giving you a godly exhortation against
the sinfulness of dancing, I suppose," said Delmour, as he
led Gertrude to open the ball; “and you look almost as
grave as though you had the fear of the kirk-session before
your eyes."
Gertrude smiled, and the exhilarating effects of the music,
and all the concomitants of a brilliant ball, soon dispelled the
unpleasant thoughts which Lyndsay's appearance had excited.
All was enchantment, while it lasted, and the Countess
believed she was happy.
But the morrow told another tale when she awoke to the
realities of life, and found the delusion had vanished, leaving
only dust and rubbish to mark where it had been. It was
near the hour when Lyndsay had said he was to call, but she
had not promised to receive him. It was disagreeable to see

anybody that morning-her head ached-her house was in
confusion-her servants were all stupid with wine or sleep-
nothing was as it ought to be; then two o'clock was the hour
when she was to set off for Richmond, and she should be so
hurried ! No, it was impossible quite impossible—it was
unreasonable to expect that she should be able to enter on
business all at once so wholly unprepared, and she resolved
to send her excuse ; but just then her maid entered to say
that Mr. Lyndsay was below, but as he was in no hurry
begged her ladyship might not be disturbed. There was no
evading this, and, with a mixture of haste and delay, she
prepared for the interview.
CHAPTER LXII.
IF Lyndsay had parted in displeasure, as Gertrude thought
he had done, the night before, all traces of it had completely
vanished. But there was a settled seriousness in his look and
manner, which made her feel that levity would be misplaced,
and if anything so graceful could have felt awkward, she
would have done so. As it was, she was evidently embar-
rassed. She rung for her chocolate-caressed her dog-
spoke to her bird-ordered away some flowers that were too
powerful-desired her maid to fetch her some eau de
Cologne,' and, in short, seemed bent upon keeping up a
bustle around her, as if to prevent the possibility of anything
like settled conversation. Lyndsay sat calmly waiting till ali
this should be over; and, at length, her orders having been
all obeyed, she began to feel ashamed of such trifling, and
allowed the servants to leave the room without any more
frivolous commands.
“ I think I am very good-natured-am I not?” said she,
making an attempt to rally her spirits, as she sipped her
chocolate, to admit you this morning, considering how ill
you used me last night in running away from my ball; and
now to come thus behind the scene, only to see how ugly we
look after all is over, is scarcely fair."
“The spectre of pleasure is perhaps not more beautiful
than other spectres,” said Lyndsay ; 't but I have something
of a wizard's eye in these matters, and last night's scene,
brilliant as it was, could not impose upon me.--I have learnt
to distinguish real from artificial happiness."
“But my happiness, I do assure you, was quite real while
it lasted," said Gertrude, gaily; "the only melancholy part

THE INHERITANCE.
279
of it was, that it did not last quite so long as one could have
wished.”
“Is your happiness, then, of so evanescent a nature, Ger-
trude ?" asked Lyndsay.
“How very literal you are become !" answered she,
attempting to laugh ;-"you seem to have forgot the way to
jest."
"* Not when there is good occasion,” said Lyndsay,
gravely; “but, at present, I confess, I am not in a jesting
mood."
“How unfortunate! for I am not in a serious one, 80 we
shall never agree, unless, indeed, you agree to be of my
party to Richmond. Come, you surely cannot refuse me
that? However you might despise my ball as an artificial
pleasure, you must, by the same rule, approve of my fête
champêtre' as a piece of real rural felicity. Now, don't be so
churlish as to refuse. Do consent to be gay and happy like
other people.”.
“ Are you happy, Gertrude ?" asked Lyndsay, still more
gravely.
“ To be sure; why should you doubt it?”
“Because I have always looked upon true happiness as a
generous, diffusive sentiment, that sought to impart a portion
of its own blessedness to all around. Such it was with you,
Gertrude, at Rossville: but now you seem to confine it within
narrower bounds : pone of it finds its
way
there now !"
Gertrude blushed, while she attempted to smile, and
said,
“I am keeping it all to carry there along with me. I mean
to return to Rossville very soon now, and I intend that you
should all be very happy to see me."
“Some, I trust, will have good cause," said Lyndsay ;
“but, in the meantime, there are two young lovers who are
suffering, not merely the tortures of suspense, but the aggra-
vation of an evil report; yet it seems so incredible a one,
that I almost hesitate to repeat it, you will think we country
folks so credulous."
“ Pray let me hear it,” said the Countess faintly.
“ It is said that you have actually given away the living of
Rossville, which you had promised to young Leslie, to a
superannuated 'bon vivant' hanger-on of the Monteiths."
Lady Rossville's colour mounted to her very temples, and at
that moment a servant entered to say her ladyship's carriage
was in waiting. She rose, and stammered out something
about her engagement-her party, and she knew not what, as
she was moving towards the door.
“ I too have an engagement to keep," said Lyndsay, calmly,

THE INHERITANCE.
but very gravely; and he took her hand, and led her to her
seat; “I have engaged to prove the falsity of that report from
your own lips."
But Lady Rossville remained silent, evidently struggling
with her feelings.
“Gertrude, you could not be so false to others, so unjust to
yourself?" said Lyndsay, with emotion.
Shame, sorrow, and pride, all swelled in Lady Rossville's
heart almost to suffocation, but pride prevailed; and, even
while her burning cheeks and downcast eyes betrayed her
consciousness of wrong, she answered, with an air of haughty
indignation,
“One part of the report you are certainly at liberty to
contradict; I never promised the living of Rossville to Mr.
Leslie."
“You promised to provide for him when it should be in
your power.”
“ And I will yet do so; but, in the present instance, it is
not in my power; and now, Mr. Lyndsay, excuse me if I
must be gone."
* No, it is not tnus we must part,” said Lyndsay, in a tone
so firm, yet so sad, as awed the Countess, even in spite of
herself, and she remained passively waiting for what was for
to follow. “If we part thus, we may never meet again as we
have done"-he stopped in some emotion, and then pro-
ceeded.—“Before I became your guardian I had learned to
consider myself as your friend, and I had flattered myself the
confidence you then honoured me with would have been con-
tinued, but it has not proved so; I appeal to yourself, Ger-
trude, has it?"
For a moment Gertrude could not answer, but at length
she said-
“My sentiments remain unchanged, but surely you might
know enough of a London life to make allowance for any
omissions I may have been guilty of."
“I have; I do make allowance for them,” said Lyndsay;
"I knew all the dangers that awaited one of your ardent,
confiding, susceptible, but volatile nature; I knew that the
adulation of the world would prove incense too intoxicating
to be resisted by one who had not yet looked through the
shallowness of earthly grandeur; I do not, therefore, re-
roach you with your neglect, your unkindness, your almost
boundless extravagance; these are faults that may yet be
repaired—but broken promises and power misused-Ah!
Gertrude, what can make up for these g"
Lady Rossville made a gesture of impatience, as if to con-
ceal her agitation, then said,

THE INHERITANCE.
281
"I have already disclaimed the promise; the power is my
own; I did not imagine I was accountable for it to Mr.
Lyndsay."
“No, Gertrude, you are accountable to a higher tribunal,
even to God himself, for the choice you make of his minis-
ters. I am aware, that in the world the appointment of a
clergyman is reckoned a slight thing, but I view it differently,
and, as your guardian, I protest against the choice you have
made."
“ It is too late," said Gertrude in a faltering voice.
“No, it cannot be too late. You have been misled, be-
trayed into one engagement at the expense of another. If you
will give me leave, I will yet extricate you from it.”
"Impossible !" exclaimed the Countess, in an agitated tone,
as she shrunk from the thoughts of encountering Delmour's
displeasure. “Why then teaze me by prolonging this painful
and needless discussion? I will not, I cannot, retract what I
have done."
“Ah! Gertrude, do not suffer a false principle of honour
thus to sway all your better feelings. If no higher motive
can influence you in this, at least let me conjure you, by the
friendship of former days, by the affection you bear your
cousin, who loves you so tenderly, she will not believe in the
possibility of your deceiving her"
“Oh, Lyndsay, do not, do not torture me !" cried Gertrude,
as she covered her face with her hand.
“It is to save you from the torture of an upbraiding con-
science, dear Gertrude, that I thus afflict you. The happiness
of two amiable interesting beings is in your hands; you are
their only earthly stay at present; should you fail their
disappointment may be bitter, but the reproaches of your
own heart will be bitterer still.”
Lady Rossville's heart heaved, and, in spite of her efforts
to restrain them, tears burst from her eyes; but at that mo-
ment she thought she heard Delmour's knock; she started
up, and hastily brushed away the tear from her cheek :-
“Let there be an end of this,” said she—“I can hear no
“Yes," said Lyndsay, seizing her hand to detain her, while
his own shook with emotion, "you must hear yet more-you
must hear me resign from henceforth the office of your guar-
dian; 'tis a mockery I can no longer endure."
Lady Rossville made no reply. A thousand contending
feelings struggled in her breast, but she repressed them all
with that force which is the result of conscious weakness, and
with the calmness of one determined to do wrong, she merely
bent her head in acquiescence.
more."

morse.
“ Should the time ever arrive when Lady Rossville, gay
and prosperous as she now is, should want the aid or counsel
of a friend, "-Lyndsay's voice faltered, but the Countess re-
mained calm and motionless—“Gertrude, will you remember
me?" But Gertrude averted her face to hide the anguish
that filled her heart. “At least, you will say Farewell' to
“Farewell,” said Gertrude in an assumed tone of indiffer-
ence, and without turning round. Lyndsay dropped the hand
he held in his, and in another instant was gone.
It was then Gertrude's long-repressed feelings burst forth
in all their violence. “Unkind, unjust, ungrateful that I
am !" exclaimed she to herself, as she wept in an agony of re-
“I have lost the best, the truest friend, and he
thinks me-Oh, what a cold-hearted, unfeeling wretch must
he think mel-how must I have behaved, when even Lynd-
say, the
mild, forgiving, disinterested Lyndsay, has renounced
me !" But her sorrow and her self-reproaches were checked
by the entrance of Delmour, who, after knocking, had stopped
to speak to a friend who was passing, and while so engaged
Lyndsay had gone out. The cousins did not speak, but from
the expression of his countenance, Delmour at once perceived
he had no cause for jealousy.
But for the first time, the sight of her lover failed to bring
pleasure to Gertrude, as she contrasted his gay triumphant
mien with Lyndsay's mild, pleading look, and melancholy air ;
and when he accosted her with an exclamation of astonish-
ment, she turned from him, as she thought, “ It is he who
has caused me to act thus !"
“My dear Gertrude," cried he, "what is the meaning of all
this ? But I guess how it is; you have had a puritanical lecture
from the very reverend Edward Lyndsay, and I am not sur-
prised you should weep at it, were it only from weariness."
But Gertrude still leant her head dejectedly upon her hand,
and only sighed in answer.
" By Heavenl” cried Delmour passionately," he shall an-
swer to me for every tear he has made you shed.”
“Beware how you add to the sorrow you have already
brought upon me, Delmour," said Gertrude ; “I have fora
given much, and may forgive more, but I will never forgive
insult or injury offered to Edward Lyndsay on my account.”
Haughty and overbearing as Delmour was, he saw that, on
the present occasion, he was not likely to obtain the mastery,
and he was piqued to find that it required all his skill and
eloquence to prevail upon Lady Rossville to keep her engage-
ment, and join the party to Richmond. At length he pre-
vailed; but she set out with a heavy heart. By degrecs, how-

ever, the novelty and the gaiety of the scene, the beauty of
the day, the succession of lovely landscapes that met the eye
as they glided along, the music, the company, all combined to
charm the senses, and Lyndsay was forgot
CHAPTER LXIII.
The London season was now drawing near a close, and
Lady Rossville had run her full career of folly and extrava-
gance. As bills came pouring in upon her from all quarters,
she was startled at the magnitude of the sums she had ex-
pended, and for which she had now nothing to show but a
parcel of gewgaws, which had ceased, with their novelty, to
afford her any pleasure. She felt almost glad that Lyndsay
was no longer her guardian, that he might not see the extent
of her imprudence ; for even Delmour was surprised when he
heard how much she had spent in so short a time.
Summer was far advanced, or rather autumn had commenced,
before they returned to Rossville. It was with mingled feel-
ings of pleasure and pain that Gertrude beheld it again. Even
while her heart bounded at the sight of every well-known
object, they seemed to reproach her with having lavished her
thoughts, her affections, her money, upon worthless baubles,
and heartless pleasures. Her conscience smote her as she
passed some old cottages which she had planned pulling down,
and building new and more commodious ones in their place.
“Half of what my opera-box cost me would have done that,"
sighed she; "and that bridge !" as she caught a glimpse of
one half-finished ; “the poor people must still go two miles
about, till my diamond necklace is paid ;" and tears of con-
trition dropped from her eyes.
But it was not so at the Castle ; for Delmour's orders had
superseded Lyndsay's schemes, and, however the poor might
suffer, nothing had been left undone there. The conserva-
tory and the garden had been completed, and stocked at an
immense expense; the apartments were superbly and taste-
fully furnished; the theatre was almost finished, and again
Gertrude's volatile heart throbbed with pride and pleasure,
as she looked on this new creation of taste and fancy, and
anticipated the joys yet to come. But, as the novelty abated,
again the voice of conscience was heard, and the thoughts of
Lyndsay recurred. She wondered whether he would come
to visit her upon her return, and she both wished and dreaded
the meeting ; but day after day passed on and Lyndsay came

not. Her cousin Anne, too, how could she behold her, with-
out shame and confusion of face! But her apprehensions on
that score were partly relieved, by receiving the following
note a few days after her arrival :-
“MY DEAR LADY ROSSVILLE,
“I am very well sure it will give you pleasure
to hear that William has at length been provided for, as I
know how much it must have pained you to be unable to ful-
fil your kind intentions in his favour, But what you could
not do yourself, your kind friend Mr. Lyndsay has done for
you. He has so generously interested himself in this affair,
that he has got William appointed to the living of Whinbrae ;
and Mr. Turner, who was to have succeeded to that church,
he has secured in a secular office of greater emolument, and
better suited to his views and sentiments. The only obstacle
to our union is therefore now removed ; and as we are to have
immediate possession of the manse, it is to take place very
soon—perhaps in the course of the next week. It is to you,
under heaven, that we owe our happiness, by interesting so
kind and generous a patron in our behalf. Accept, therefore,
my dear Lady Rossville, the united thanks and prayers of
" Your affectionate,
ANNE BLACK.
hand obliged and grateful
WILLIAM LESLIE."
" Kind and generous, indeed !” exclaimed Lady Rossville,
as she read this billet, and a blush of shame burned on her
cheek. “He has saved me as far as he could from the disgrace
of at best, I fear, equivocation, and from the wretchedness of
having disappointed the hopes of those whom I had taught to
put their trust in me."
In the overflowing of her heart she wrote to Anne, expressing
her participation in her happiness, and giving the sole credit
of it to Mr. Lyndsay. She could not bring herself to tell
her exactly how matters stood, but she assured her again and
again, that it was to him, and to him only, they were in-
debted.
She thought she ought also to write to Lyndsay, to thank
him for his kindness to her relations, and she took up the pen
for that purpose, but she could not write anything to please
herself; one style was too cold and formal the warmth of
her feelings; another too humble and penitential for her
pride to stoop to, and Delmour might be displeased.
"No!"
exclaimed she as she threw down the pen, “I cannot write
what I feel, I must either say too much or too little. It would
be otherwise were we to meet; a few words would set all to

rights, and how I wish he would afford me an opportunity of
making my peace with him! I cannot be happy while I
think I have forfeited his good opinion. Surely he will come,
and he will be pleased to find I have not forgotten all his good
lessons ;" and she tried to resume the studies and occupations
she had begun at his suggestion; but it would not do—the
illusions of passion and the vanities of life still maintained
their sway over her, and all was dull and joyless that did not
administer to one or other. “I shall never be good,” sighed
she, “according to Lyndsay's notions, so 'tis in vain to try-
perhaps Delmour would not like me so well if I were ;" and
that argument was conclusive against all further attempts of
the kind.
Colonel Delmour's absence had been protracted much be-
yond the period assigned, by the alarming illness of his bro-
ther, whose life at one time had been in imminent danger, in
consequence of a pleuritic attack, the consequence, it was
said (as everything of the kind must either have or be a
consequence), of cold caught at a late sitting of a committee,
of which he was chairman. He was now better, and as soon
as he was sufficiently recovered for his brother to leave him,
the impatient lover was to set off for Rossville ; meanwhile,
he implored Gertrude to write to him every day, every hour,
if possible, as the only alleviation to the tortures of separa-
tion. Such was Colonel Delmour's way of telling the story,
and, as usual, it contained a portion of truth and falsehood.
It was true that his brother had been dangerously ill while he
was in London, but it was not true that he was still detained
there from that cause. The fact was, he rather dreaded a
dull family party at Rossville, for, lover as he was, he was
too much a man of the world, too much accustomed to be
amused, to be able to devote himself entirely to one object,
however much beloved, -and Gertrude was as much beloved
by him as anything could be ; but he felt himself now so se-
cure in her affections, that there was not even the stimulants
of jealousy or uncertainty to give a zest to their intercourse.
In short, Colonel Delmour's heart and affections were so
jaded and sophisticated, that simple feelings and simple plea-
sures had now become stale and insipid. He rather liked the
country for two or three months in the autumn with a good
party; but to be constantly enacting the sentimental lover,
and with no greater variety than Lady Betty and Mrs. St.
Clair, or an interchange of neighbourly visits with some agri-
cultural lord or raw-boned squire to be bored about county
politics or county races—it was more than either his love or
his philosophy could endure. At length his brother's con-
valescence left him no excuse, and he wrote to Gertrude that

he would have set off instantly, but as the Arabins, Peverlys,
and his friend Ilfrington, were preparing to storm Rossville,
he had been prevailed upon to wait a day or two, and join
the party. A P.S. added they should probably go by the
Lakes, as Lady Charles had taken a sketching turn, and Lord
Charles wished to eat char.
Lady Rossville was deeply mortified at this letter. It con-
tained even more than the usual quantity of love superlatives,
was eloquent on the miseries of separation, and the antici-
pated happiness of their meeting; but still he did not fly to
her-he could submit to wait on the movements of a capri-
cious fine lady, and the taste of an indolent gourmand—and,
for the first time, a doubt of the reality of his attachment
struck upon her heart. The supposition was too dreadful to
be endured, and she shrank from it as she would from the
stroke of a dagger. "At least he does not love as I do!”
thought she, as she tried to dispel the fast-gathering tears,
that, in spite of herself, rushed to her eyes; " but I was a
fool to expect it. Who ever loved so fondly, so truly, as
I have done ?-and men never love with the devotion of wo-
men. But I would have Delmour different from every one
else-I would be his all, as he is mine." Then to wounded
tenderness succeeded pride. He had besought her to write
to him as usual, and mentioned the places where he should
expect to find letters from her ; but she determined to punish
him by her silence, though the punishment would, in the first
instance, fall upon herself, as the forbearance of not writing
was, probably, at least equal to the disappointment of not re-
ceiving her letters.
Lady Rossville then ordered her carriage, and set forth to
try the effects of rapid driving and change of company in dis-
pelling chagrin and ennui.
Bellevue was her first destination, for she could now en-
dure to meet Anne, since she found her conduct was not
viewed in the light she feared it would have been. She was
welcomed by Mrs. Black with even more than her wonted
cordiality, and having dismissed the children, who were in the
room with her, she immediately started the subject of Anne's
marriage, prefacing her observations with a deep sigh, or
rather groan
“I'm sure we were all much obliged to you, my lady, for
refusing to give them your church. I was in great hopes
that might have put an end to the thing altogether, and I
really believe it would, if it had not been for Mr. Lyndsay.
Folk are really ill employed sometimes when they think
they're doing good, and it would, maybe, be just as well if
there was less of that kind of interference in the world. As

Mr. Black says, ' Let ilka sheep hang by its ain shank ;' and
it might have been long enough before William Leslie would
have got a kirk, and in that time there's no saying what might
have happened; but now her father's just weary and sick of
the subject, and he has given his consent, -and what could
he do else ?-80 it will all be over soon now;" and Mrs.
Black heaved another sigh.
" I trust they will both be very happy,” said Gertrude.
“It may be so," said Mrs. Black coldly; “but it will be
but a waiff kind of happiness—very different from her two
sisters, who want for nothing, and both keep their own car-
riages; but I must always think her family are little obliged
to Mr. Lyndsay."
Upon hearing that her cousin was going to walk to Barn-
ford to visit her aunts, the Countess offered her a seat in her
carriage, which she willingly accepted of. While Anne went
to make ready, Mrs. Black again returned to the charge,
and again expressed her own and Mr. Black's gratitude for
the friendly part she had acted in refusing the kirk.
for this marriage,” said she, “I have no heart to make any
ploy of it, so I shall
ask nobody. The lads may come out to
it if they like, but I'm very doubtful if the Major and his
lady will countenance it.”
Gertrude was on the point of offering to attend, but just
then Anne returned, and they set off. No sooner were they
alone than Anne began to repeat her acknowledgments for
what had been done. “ Had it not been for Mr. Lyndsay,"
said she, “I know not what would have become of us, for my
mother had resolved upon sending me to London to live with
my sister, in hopes that a change might have been wrought
in my sentiments; but it would have served no purpose but
to render us both unhappy, for the love that is founded in
religion and virtue cannot change."
"No," said Gertrude; “I do not think the love could
have been true that any circumstances could ever change."
“It is perhaps sometimes difficult to distinguish false from
true,” said Anne ; “but I am sure whoever Mr. Lyndsay
loves he will love truly, and whoever loves him will love for
ever and aye.”
“He has made a warm advocate in you," said Lady Ross-
ville, smiling:
“Ah, he deserves much more than I can say of him! Had
you but seen with what warmth and kindness he entered into
our affairs, and how feelingly he sympathised in our disap-
pointment, and how vexed he seemed upon your account
too-
“ Upon my account !" exclaimed Gertrude, while a glow of

conscious shame suffused her cheek" How-what could he
say for me ?"
“He did not say much; but when my father and mother
argued from your having otherwise disposed of the church,
that you were opposed to our union, he disclaimed that idea
altogether, and said, that although you had inadvertently
made an engagement which you thought you could not break,
yet he was sure you suffered more than any of us did, and he
said it in a way that showed how much he felt for you."
"It is in sorrow then, and not in anger, that he thinks of
me !" thought Gertrude, but there was something more humi-
liating in the one than the other. She could have made
overtures to be reconciled, but she could not sue to be for-
given, and she sought to steel herself against the repentance
that her cousin's recital had awakened in her breast.
As Anne was about to renew the grateful theme, the
Countess abruptly changed the conversation, and as they
were then in sight of uncle Adam's mansion, she proposed to
pay him a visit, to which Anne timidly assented, not having
had the courage to encounter him since her intended marriage
had been made known to him.
They were received, as usual, in a very doubtful sort of
way by Mr. Ramsay. Gertrude's looks commonly softened
his asperities, by recalling the image of his Lizzie ; and it
was so long since he had seen her, that he would have almost
hailed her appearance, had not the rumour of her engage-
ment with Colonel Delmour reached his ears, and caused
them to tingle to the very drum with indignation. She
looked pale, and out of spirits too, and less like Lizzie than
usual; so that he was ready to take the field against her,
especially as he saw that she had got a new and more splen-
dið equipage, and her dress was something he was not accus-
tomed to see pass his windows every day.
“I canna say London has improved you,” said he, scarcely
looking at her. “I dinna think I wad hae kent you if I had
met you. If that's a' you have made by it, I think you
would have been just as weel at hame."
“Much better, I believe," said Lady Rossville, with a sigh
she did not intend. “London is not the place for either
light heads or light purses like mine."
Uncle Adam thought this savoured of an attack upon his
hoards, and he resented it accordingly. “Ay, light heads
mak light purses, and it's best they should keep company wi'
ane anither."
Lady Rossville only smiled at this rebuff, then said,
"Well, as you don't seem to make my light head and my
light purse very welcome, here is a light heart that I hope

289
will please you better,” pointing to Anne, whose happy,
blooming face, and little simply-dressed figure, formed quite
a contrast to the Countess's pale complexion, dissatisfied ex-
pression, and elegant, but fanciful style of dress.
“Oo ay, sweet hearts are aye light hearts; but maybe
that's ower light a word for you and your dominie. I dinna
ken what you religious folk ca' yoursel's. Hae ye ony godly
name that you carry on your courtships wi'?”
Poor Anne blushed, as she answered, in some confusion,
that her uncle might call her what he pleased.
“And if I should ca' you twa great fules ?" demanded he.
“Perhaps you will only call us by our right names,” said
Anne, with a smile.
“There's some modesty at least in that,” said uncle Adam
more benignly; " but what did you mean by carrying on
this hiddlin' coortship o' yours sae lang? I never heard a
word o't till I heard it frae your father last week."
“I thought it unnecessary to trouble you upon a subject
which did not interest you,” said Anne.
“How did you ken whether it would interesst me or no?
I suppose if I had had a kirk in my aught, you wad hae
thought it very interesstin'.” Then as his attention was
attracted to the carriage moving forward, “ That's a fine
ootset for a minister's wife, or else no, to be riding up and
down the country in a phyeton and fower, and her twa
flunkies !” But at that moment the Waddell carriage took the
place of the Rossville one, and Mrs. Major herself appeared
in all her pomp and bustle. “This is very hard," muttered
Mr. Ramsay, as he turned to and fro, " that I canna ca' my
hooss my ain.
But Mrs. Major now entered in a very slow, solemn, inte-
resting manner; and, as if much fatigued by the exertion of
walking from her carriage to the house, she seated herself
immediately on her entrance, and then held out her hand,
first to uncle Adam, who would not take it, next to Lady
Rossville, with an affectionate shake, and, lastly, to Anne,
whom she scarcely touched.
6. This is the second time I have been out," said she,
speaking in a languid, affected tone, and applying a smelling-
bottle to her nose ; " and I feel quite fatigued with the exer-
tion of walking from the carriage here."
“I am sorry to hear you have been unwell,” said Lady
Rossville ; "nothing_serious, I hope ?"
“Good' gracious, Lady Rossville !” exclaimed Mrs. Wad-
dell, roused into energy,
'have you forgot that I have been
confined ?"
60-I-I beg pardon," said Gertrude, as some confused

notion daried across her brain of having heard of some such
event when in London.
“The Major announced it to Mrs. St. Clair, I know," said
the lady.
“Yes-very true I had forgot, but I-"
" And you must have seen it in the papers—I know the
Major sent it to all the papers."
“He had very little to do,” observed uncle Adam.
“What paper do you get ?" demanded Mrs. Major, deter-
mined to dive to the bottom of this mystery.
" I seldom read any but the “Morning Post.”
“And was it not there?"
Perhaps-very likely–I dare say it was—but"
“You know, it it had been there, you must have seen it,
and it wasn't a thing to overlook. I must let the Major
know that, and have it inquired into. I know he sent it to
every one of the papers—I know that perfectly.”
Lady Rossville now thought she recollected Mrs. St. Clair
mentioning a heir to the race of Waddells; and, by way of
atoning for her lapse, she said, “I hope your little boy is
quite well ?"
“Boy!" exclaimed the still more exasperated lady; "it
happens to be a girl! and, I assure you, the Major and I
were much better pleased - we were both very anxious for a
girl-for, although where there is a title in the family, it is
natural to wish for a son, yet we both think it is of the
greatest consequence the eldest should be a girl, so it was a
great gratification to us—it was just what we wanted."
“Very true--I beg your pardon.”
But the outraged mother turned towards Mr. Ramsay,
"I am come, uncle, to make a request in the name of my
little miss, whom we must really think of having christened
some of these days. As the Major is an Episcopalian, we
shall, of course, have it done according to that service ; and
we hope you will kindly officiate as godfather upon the occa-
sion."
At this proposal uncle Adam looked “black as night,
fierce as ten furies ;" and he seemed on the point of uttering
some awful anathema, when, suddenly checking himself, he
said, in one of his alarmingly, mild tones, “I've nae great
objections provided I'm to ha'e the bairn called after me.'
Mrs. Waddell was confounded. On the one hand, that
was all but declaring the child his heir ; on the other, Adam
Waddell was rather an uncouth appellation for a young lady.
But then a movable tail might be tacked to Adam ; she
might be Adam to him, and Adamine, or Adamella, or Ada-
mintha, to the rest of the world ; and Mrs. Major inwardly

291
chuckled at the proposal, though she resolved, at the same
time, to enhance the value of the concession. She, therefore,
said,
Why, to tell you the truth, uncle, I had fixed in my own
mind to have our little miss called after the Major, although
he declares she must be named after me; but I think
Andromache is such a beautiful name, and so off the com,
mon-
“ Andrew Mackaye's a very gude name for her, to be
sure," said uncle Adam, gravely.
“Good gracious, uncle ! such a way of pronouncing An-
dromache ! However, I shall give up all thoughts of that,
since you are so anxious to have our missy named after
you.'
“Weel," said uncle Adam, with a savage smile ; " that's a'
settled, for you'll no object to a bit trifling addition to the
name, for it's rather short and pookit-isna't ?".
“Why, to tell the truth, I think it is, and an addition
would certainly be an improvement-Adamintha, for in-
stance."
“I like a name that has some meaning in't, and the name
that ye're to ca' your bairn after me maun be Adamant; for
I can tell baith you and her, that Adamant you'll find me to
the last generation o’you."
The natural man here broke out, and Adam was himself
again.
“Really, uncle, you have the oddest ways," began the lady,
affecting to laugh, in order to cover her confusion;
shall say no more about it at present. I shall leave it to the
Major and you to settle it, and,” addressing Lady Rossville,
so when it does take place, we hope, cousin, you will be one
of the godmothers, and favour us with your company on the
occasion; and, I flatter myself, your god-daughter will not
discredit
you.
Dr. Brambleton says, she is, without excep-
tion, the largest and finest child he ever beheld, and just her
father's picture.
Lady Rossville bowed, then rose to take her leave, and
motioned Anne to accompany her.
" Bless me !” exclaimed Mrs. Waddell, “is it possible,
Anne, that you are flaunting about in a fine open carriage? Í
had no idea you would have done anything so dissipated.
What will the synod say to that?" in an affected whisper.
Anne was too meek to retort, but uncle Adam was always
ready to take up the cudgels for the oppressed.
" Are you no satisfied wi' ha'in' a chaise o' your ain,
but you maun envye your sister, puir thing! a ride in other
folks'?"
So we

“Envy!" repeated Mrs. Major, with a toss. “I'm sure I
don't know what I should envy her or any one else for. As
for four horses, I could have them whenever I choose, but I
greatly prefer a pair; so what I have to envy I'm sure I
don't know"-with an affected laugh of contempt.
“It's a pity you should be at a loss for something to wrack
your envye upon," said uncle Adam, as be opened his little
old bureau, and took out the identical 5001. bill he had
received from Lady Rossville, and which had lain there ever
since: “Ha'e, my dear,” to Anne, “there's something for
you to begin the world wi'; see what it is."
Anne looked at the bill, and was too much overwhelmed to
be able to speak, but the glow that overspread her face, and
the tears of joy that stood in her soft blue eyes, spoke
volumes. Uncle Adam saw her vainly attempting to thank
him, and, patting her on the shoulder, said, “ You needna fash
to say onything about it, so gang your ways. Ha'e you a
pocket to pit it in ?" and he almost thrust her out at the
door.
Mrs. Waddell was now past speaking. She was to have
waited for the Major, whom she had permitted to go to a
meeting in the County Hall, but to wait was impossible. She
instantly drove oft, and called the Major away from his busi-
ness to attend to her injuries, and consult whether it would
not be possible to cognosce' uncle Adam, and get the editor
of the Morning Post put in the pillory.
CHAPTER LXIV.
The weather had now set in wet; everything without was
cheerless, within was dull; and, surrounded with all that
wealth and luxury could furnish, Lady Rossville felt that
neither could protect their possessors against weariness and
satiety. Delmour had taught her to despise the society of the
neighbourhood, and since her return she had kept rather
aloof from any intercourse; but she would now have been
glad of any one to break the tedium of the maternal “tête-à-
tête. Her reading, her music, her drawing, her embroidery,
were all tried, and all failed to interest or amuse, for her
ardent but ill-regulated mind sought in every occupation, not
the medicine to cure, but the aliment to feed her distempered
fancy: Delmour voluntarily absent from her, was the idea
that haunted her day and night. To look at his picture-to
shed tears over it-to begin letters of reproach only to be

torn-to think of whether she ought ever to see him again
-were the chief resources against the weariness of exist-
The third day of incessant rain was drawing to a close.
The mother and daughter were together in the saloon, when
the Countess rose and opened a window, for the fifth time
within the last hour, to see whether the rain was not abating ;
but it fell thicker than ever; everything was dripping, but
there was not a breath of wind to relieve the surcharged trees
of their moisture; no living thing was to be seen, except now
and then a bird which shot silently past; not a sound was to
be heard, except the sullen roar of the river, as it was urged
along beyond its natural course.
Lady Rossville, in despair, was about to shut the window,
when, dimly discernible through the mist and rain, she
descried a carriage approaching:
“It is Delmour, after all,” thought she, with a throb of
delight—"he has meant to take me by surprise !" and all sad-
ness and ennui fled at that idea.
“Mamma-it is—he is—there is a carriage,” cried she in
all the flutter of joy, as a hack chaise-and-four, with one gen-
tleman inside, wheeled rapidly round to the entrance, and was
lost to sight.
In a second the door was thrown open; no name was an-
nounced; but, preceded by the groom of the chambers, there
entered-Lewiston!
At sight of him, Gertrude stood immovable, while Mrs.
St. Clair, uttering a shriek, clapped her hands before her eyes,
as if to shut out the dreadful apparition. He only smiled at
this salutation, and approaching the Countess, held out his
hand to her with the freedom of an old acquaintance; but her
cheeks glowed with indignation while she turned from him
with an air of lofty disdain. He looked at her for a moment
with an expression half menacing, half ironical, then turned
to Mrs. St. Clair, who, trembling and convulsed, rested her
head upon a table, as if not daring to look up.
“This intrusion is too much,' said the Countess, as she
moved towards the bell; but in passing, her mother caught
her gown with almost frantic energy, and without raising her
head, exclaimed, in a low gasping tone, “Gertrude, Gertrude,
have mercy upon me!" Then making a violent effort, she
rose and tottered, rather than walked, a few steps towards
Lewiston, and, extending her hands, tried to welcome him;
but her face was ghastly, and the words died upon her lips.
“Why, what is all this?” said he in his usual tone of fa-
miliar assurance, as he took her hands in his. “ You look as
though you had seen a ghost, my good lady, instead of an

old friend. But don't be afraid, I am not from the other
world, only from the wrong side of this one, with my honest
Trudge here," patting a great sneaking lurcher, which stuck
to him like a bur; and he laughed.
“Pardon me," said Mrs. St. Clair ; " but the surprise-I
believed you-I—" But her lips seemed parched, and her
tongue as though it clove to the roof of her mouth; she
could not proceed.
“It must be apparent to you, sir," said Lady Rossville,
haughtily, while yet her heart trembled within her, “that
your presence was unlooked for—is unwelcome," added she,
as, even while she spoke, he seated himself, and smiled
saucily.
Her indignation got the better of her fear.
“I know not who you are,” said she, again approaching
the bell," and I receive no visitors who are unknown to me.'
Again Mrs. St. Clair caught her—"Gertrude-dearest
Gertrude, be quiet—all will be well.”
“ The Countess was going to order her servants to show
me to the door, was she ?" demanded Lewiston, in the same
insulting tone of irony; “but her ladyship may spare her-
self the trouble-I have sent off the chaise ; this will be my
home for some time, will it not?” to Mrs. St. Clair.
Lady Rossville disengaged herself from her mother, and
rang the bell with violence.
Gertrude, will you destroy me?” exclaimed Mrs. St.
Clair, in a voice of agony that thrilled to her daughter's
heart, and made her pause.
When the summons was
answered, “Nothing, nothing, Thompson,” cried Mrs. St.
Clair eagerly to the servant, - shut the door-that's all.”
Gertrude's face was in a glow with the emotions that strug-
gled in her breast. To be thus braved in her own house
her resentment mocked-her power, as it were, annihilated
her mother trembling before a menial, or, at least, one whom
she herself only recognised as the husband of a menial-her
brain felt as on fire, and she stood speechless from excess of
agitation.
“So you thought, I suppose, I had gone to Davy's
locker ?” said Lewiston, addressing Mrs. St. Clair. "I read
the account of the shipwreck of the Dauntless-by-the-bye,
it was in the same paper with the old gentlemen's death, for
these things are sometimes a long while of reaching us on
tother side the Atlantiumso, when I saw how the land lay,

wasn't it a luckiness that I had changed my ship? Some poor

the Hebe-wasn't I good-natured? But I am very good-
natured, and virtue, you know, is always its own reward-
eh?"
" If such are your friends," said Lady Rossville, addressing
her mother, in a voice almost inarticulate," this house is no
longer a residence for me;" and again ringing the bell, which
was instantly answered (probably from Mr. Thompson hav-
ing stationed himself outside the door), she desired her car-
riage to be got ready immediately; then rushing past the
servant, she flew to her own apartment. There her exasper-
ated spirit gave way to tears, and she wept in uncontrollable
agony. In a few minutes she was followed by Mrs. St. Clair ;
but, on her entrance, Gertrude turned away her head from
her, as if determined to listen to nothing she could say.
“Gertrude !” said her mother, in a deep and agitated
voice ; but she made no answer.
“ Gertrude !" cried she again, as she would have taken
her hand ; but the Countess withdrew it.
“ Gertrude !" repeated she, and she sank on her knees at
her daughter's feet.
Lady Rossville started up in horror, but her mother clung
to her gown.

“Do not turn from me," cried she wildly, “but tell me,
can I do more to soften you? On my knees I beg of you to
have mercy upon me!"
“Oh!" exclaimed Gertrude, with a shudder, as she sought
to raise her mother.
“No, I have to beg for my
life-for my
fame-at your

would not drive me to distraction, rise."

“I will—I will--anything but this."
Mrs. St. Clair rose. “Gertrude, you may bring me yet
lower than you have now seen me ; you may bring me to my
grave. Oh, that I were already there !" cried she, with a
burst of tears.
“Tell me--only tell me—the meaning of this horrid mys-
tery,” said Gertrude, trying to speak calmly: “tell me why
that man dares to treat me as he does."

Mrs. St. Clair looked upon her with a wild and ghastly
stare; her very lips turned white, and she seemed as if
bereft of all power of reply; but, by a sudden revulsion, the
blood flew to her face, and she said in a tone of bitterness,-
“Even this humiliation I will endure: as I hope to be
saved, I was ever a true and faithful wife; so judge me
Heaven !" There was a fervour and solemnity in the appeal
which carried conviction.
Lady Rossville uncovered her eyes, and fetched her breath,
and a pause ensued, which, after some minutes, Mrs. St.
Clair gathered courage to break,--,
" It is in vain that you would seek to penetrate the myste-
rious tie which links my fate with that of Lewiston, and
which extends even to you; and it will be no less vain to
attempt to free yourself from his power. Hear me, Gertrude,
hear me ; you promised you would. If it were possible, if it
were in human endeavour-can you, for a moment, imagine
that I would submit to what you have witnessed ?" and tears
of passion dropped from her eyes.
“Still less can I imagine any cause which can make you
submit to it," said the Countess ; "and it is impossible that I
should- I will not-I cannot do it, be the consequences what
they may."
Åt that moment her maid entered, to say her Ladyship’s
carriage was waiting, and while she spoke, the rain fell like
a water-spout.
“That is enough-let it wait," said her mistress, who, in
the tumult of her mind, forgot all feelings of humanity for
man or beast. The Abigail withdrew, to agree with Mr.
Thompson that something strange was certainly going on,
but what, they could not divine. The gentleman in the
saloon had ordered up some luncheon for himself, and was
eating and drinking to his heart's content, while the ladies
were above stairs all in tears. "'Twas strange, 'twas passing
strange!"
CHAPTER LXV.
THE hour of dinner came, and when Mrs. St. Clair returned
to her daughter's dressing-room, she found her as she had left
her, extended upon a couch, and deaf to all Miss Masham's
hints of dressing. Mrs. St. Clair dismissed the maid, and

then in a soothing voice, said, “ Gertrude, my dearest, you
will come to dinner. I have had a long conversation with
Lewiston ; he has promised not to offend you with the blunt-
ness of his American manners, but you ought to make allow-
ance for them; he is an independent citizen of a republican
State, where all you know is liberty and equality ; but he
means no offence, and will endeavour to adapt himself more
to our notions of propriety while he remains, which I expect
will be for a very short time.”
“While he remains I shall keep my own apartment,” said
Gertrude, without raising her head.
“ Impossible !" exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair, in agitation ; "he
will never consent; that is, I cannot consent-dearest Ger-
trude, if you would not have me on my knees again, rise and
come with me.
Lady Rossville sighed heavily, and rose.
Her appearance, however, was little in unison with the
pomp
and order, and high keeping of everything that surrounded
her; her dress was deranged-her hair was dishevelled—the
cheek on which she had rested was of a crimson hue, while
the other was of a deadly pale; and though she passed on
with an even loftier air than usual, it was without once lifting
her eyes from the ground.
“I hope your Ladyship feels recruited," said Lewiston, as
she took her place at table. He evidently meant to be polite,
but there was something in the tone that grated on her ear.
She started at the sound of his voice, and a faint flush over-
spread her whole face, as she slightly bent her head in
reply,
"I found the Countess fast asleep when I went to her,"
said Mrs. St. Clair, quickly, as if answering for her daughter,
“ but she has not slept away that vile headache, it seems;
however, we are such a little quiet party, that I persuaded her
to appear. . We shall not expect you to talk, my love, but do
eat something; the soup is very good. I think Brumeau has
even surpassed himself to-day:
"You keep a French cook " demanded Lewiston: “ that's
a confounded expense, is it not?”.
“Not for Lady Rossville," said Mrs. St. Clair, with a blush
at the vulgarity of her friend, as she saw a sneer on the faces
even of the well-bred gentlemen of the second table.
66 Ah, but there are better ways and worse of spending
money; however, another plateful of it, if you please, my
Lady-you may give me two spoonfuls—there--that's it
you do me the favour to drink a glass of wine ?”
“The Countess is so poor a wine-drinker," again inter-
now will

posed Mrs. St. Clair, " that you had better accept of me as
her substitute."
“ Come, we shall all drink together; come, my Lady, take
a glass, to drive away the blue devils this bad day."
Gertrude's agony was scarcely endurable, but she still sat
immovable, with her eyes bent upon her plate, though without
even attempting to taste what Mrs. St. Clair had put upon it.
Meanwhile Lewiston was eating and drinking with all the
ardour of a hungry man, and the manners of a vulgar one.
He tasted of everything, evidently from curiosity; and,
though it was apparent that the style was something he had
not been accustomed to, yet he maintained the same forward
ease, as though he were quite at home.
• Well, that may do for once,” said he, after having
finished ; " but, in America, we should scarcely call this a
dinner-eh, Trudge,” to his dog. “Why, another such as
myself would have looked silly here-I like to see a good
joint or two."
Mrs. St. Clair tried to laugh.
“What do you think, for instance, of a fine, jolly, juicy,
thirty pound round of well-corned beef and parsnips ; or a
handsome leg of pork and pease-pudding, and a couple of fat
geese well stuffed with sage and onions,
swimming in apple-
sauce ? Ah, these are the dishes for me !" and he rubbed his
hands with horrid glee.
It was a relief when dinner was over, and the servants had
withdrawn; for although the degradation was not lessened,
at least there was no one to witness it, unless it were the por-
traits of the Rossville family, as they frowned from their
frames on the rude plebeian who seemed thus to have usurped
their place. Gertrude had wrought herself up to a pitch of
forbearance which it required all her powers of mind to main-
tain. A thousand times she was on the point of giving way
to her feelings, and ending this hateful scene; but as she
caught her mother's eye fixed on her with a look of imploring
agony, she checked herself,—"No," thought she, “I will
bear all for this night, but worlds shall not tempt me to
submit to such another;" and she sat in a sort of marble
endurance, while yet every nerve and fibre were stretched as
upon a rack. Like all vulgar people, Lewiston told so many
good stories of and about himself, and talked so very loud,
and laughed so very heartily, reason or none, that he com-
pletely deadened every other sound. A slight commotion in
the hall, caused by an arrival, had not therefore been heard
by any of the party ; when suddenly a servant entered, and
approaching the Countees, said, “Colonel Delmour, your

299
Ladyship;" and scarcely had he spoken, when Delmour
himself advanced with eager step. Gertrude rose to welcome
him with a rush of delight, which, for the moment, absorbed
every other consideration. But the first rapturous emotion
over, it was instantly succeeded by the painful consciousness
of the strange and unaccountable situation in which he found
her.
“Mr. Lewiston, Colonel Delmour," said Mrs. St. Clair, in
almost breathless agitation; "a friend of the family,” added
she, as she marked the haughty condescending bow with
which Delmour acknowledged the introduction. But before
Lewiston had opened his lips his assumed overdone air of
nonchalance—his vulgar but confident deportment—the very
cut of his clothes-all at a single glance betrayed to Colonel
Delmour's practised eye and refined tact that this friend of the
family was no gentleman. There was something so command-
ing in his own presence, such a decided air of superiority
about him, that even the American, coarse and blunt as he
was in feeling and perception, seemed for the moment over-
awed, or, at least, was silenced. Gertrude began to breathe
as she thought her lover had come to deliver her from the
hateful bondage in which she was held by this man and her
mother, who were both, in the jockey phrase, evidently
thrown out by his arrival. It was not till he saw the Coun-
tess seated at table that Delmour was struck with her appear-
ance as contrasted with all around her; she who was always
so gay and splendid in her evening dress was now in a morn-
ing déshabille; her hair was beautiful even in disorder, but
still it was in disorder, and although nothing could bereave
her of her loveliness and her grace, yet she looked ill, and
was embarrassed, and altogether unlike herself.
“You have been ill, Gertrude," said Delmour in a low
voice, and speaking in Italian, while he gazed upon her with
looks of the deepest interest.
No-nothing-only since the morning," answered she.
" And what has happened since the morning ?” inquired
he, still speaking in the same language, while he turned a
quick glance upon the stranger.
“Of all those pictures," said Lewiston, throwing himself
back in his chair, and addressing Mrs. St. Clair in very bad
French, as he pointed to the family portraits ; " which do
you reckon worth most money?"
Mrs. St. Clair's face crimsoned while she replied she was no
judge of pictures, and Gertrude already wished Delmour had
not come. She could not answer his question, but scarcely
knowing what she said, she asked whether he had dined.
“ Yes, I was detained at Darleton for want of horses, and
66

was obliged to have recourse to a greasy mutton-chop, and a
bottle of bad port, by way of pastime; and after all I could
only get one wretched pair, who-
"I had the start of you there, sir," said the American,
rudely interrupting him; “I had four horses from Darleton;
by Jupiter! how one does go with four horses !” and he
chucked and made a gesture as though he were driving.
This was too much ; Lady Rossville started up, and, forget-
ting all her mother's cautions, said to Delmour, “Since you
have dined there is no occasion to remain here," and taking
his offered arm, with a haughty air, she led the way to the
drawing-room, leaving Mrs. St. Clair and Lewiston con-
founded at her temerity ; but as they passed on, Mrs. St.
Clair's voice was heard in accents of entreaty to her guest.
". In the name of Heaven what does all this mean?” said
Colonel Delmour, when the Countess and he were alone.
But pride, shame, indignation, checked Gertrude's utterance,
and she could not answer.
“Something is wrong—tell me what it is—who is that
man ?"
Gertrude tried to repress her feelings while she answered-
" He is an American."
“That may be, but certainly not an American gentleman."
“ He is an old acquaintance of my father's, it seems."
“ Then you have seen him before ?"
6. Yes, but he only arrived to-day, and, I trust, will depart
to-morrow; it is unfortunate that you should have come at
the very time when we are encumbered with such a guest.
6. You don't think I have come too soon, I hope?” said Del-
mour, with a smile.
“Sooner certainly than I had reason to expect you," said
Gertrude, roused to recollection of the slight put upon her by
her lover, “considering what interesting pursuits you were
engaged in."
Delmour coloured slightly, and in some confusion said, -
“So you really were taken by my excuses, lame as they
were? The fact was, I was rather unwell at the time I wrote,
and not caring to say so to you, I wrote-I forget what-
something about making a fishing party with Arabin, was it
not?”
“No matter what it was,” cried Gertrude, “since it was
not so, though I would rather you had told me the truth at
But the fact was even so as he had first stated it.
Whether he had taken the alarm at receiving no letter from
the Countess, or that he had tired of his company, or that
some sudden freak had seized him, he suddenly left his party
and set off by himself for Rossville, leaving them to follow
once.

"
at their own time. Gertrude's heart felt lightened of half its
load. Delmour loved her as much as ever, and he was there
to protect her-what had she to fear? and again her sanguine
buoyant spirit danced in her heart, and sparkled in her
eyes.
“Well, you will endure this odious American for to-night,"
said she," and to-morrow will surely rid us of him ; but he
is so rude and overbearing in his manners that I fear you will
scarcely be able to tolerate him; promise me, then, that you
won't notice him-I am so afraid of your quarrelling."
Quarrelling !" repeated Delmour, with a smile of con-
tempt ; “no, I expect to be much amused with himbut as
for quarrelling with such a person-
“O! he is not a person to be amused with," said Gertrude,
in alarm; “he is coarse and violent, and must not be pro-
voked. Do not, for Heaven's sake, attempt to make game of
him !"
“What has brought such a person here?”.
“I cannot tell; but promise me that you will, for this night,
bear with him, such as he is ? "
Delmour promised—but smiled, at the same time, at the
importance she attached to so insignificant a being. Nothing
more was said, for just then Mrs. St. Clair entered with traces
of agitation still visible on her countenance. Gertrude ex-
pected that her mother would have taken notice of her abrupt
retreat from the dining-room, but she did not speak; she
seated herself with assumed calmness, and began stringing
some pearls belonging to one of her bracelets, but her hand
shook, and her thoughts were evidently otherwise employed.
In a few minutes she rose and rang the bell, when it was
answered, “ Have you got the cigars for Mr. Lewiston ?" in-
quired she of the servant.
“I do not know, ma'am,” replied Mr. Thompson, whose
business it was to adjust chairs, not to furnish pipes, and who
seemed to resent the question by the cold pomposity of his
reply.
" Inquire, then, and let me know immediately."
“So, in addition to his other agreeable qualities, Mr.
Lewiston is a smoker," said Lady Rossville, provoked at this
pollution of her beautiful apartment. But she was sorry she
had said it, for Mrs. St. Clair only answered with a sigh so
profound that it seemed to come from the very bottom of her
heart. Some minutes elapsed, and again she rang.
- Have
the cigars been taken to Mr. Lewiston ?" and she seemed re-
lieved when an affirmative was returned.
While Mr. Lewiston was indulging his taste for cigars, the
Countess and her lover severally retired to their toilettes.

CHAPTER LXVI.
UPON returning to the drawing-room, Gertrude found her
mother and Colonel Delmour seated at opposite sides of the
room, he lounging over some books of engravings, she with
her head resting on her hands as if buried in thought. Upon
her daughter's entrance she looked up. " Have we had cof-
fee ?" inquired she, in a way which betrayed the wandering
of her mind; but at that moment Lewiston came into the
room in the loud, noisy manner of an under-bred man, who
had taken rather too much wine, and she seemed instantly
roused to recollection. She pointed to a seat on the sofa
where she was sitting, but his eyes were riveted on the
Countess, whom he did not first recognise in her change
of dress. When he did, he exclaimed, “By Jove! I didn't
know you, you're so rigged out-why, what's going to be
acted now? The deuce! I was almost thinking of my bed,"
and he yawned. Lady Rossville crimsoned, but she caught
her mother's eye, and she said in a low voice to Delmour,
" Take no notice ;" and she began to talk earnestly to him
about some of the engravings he was looking at, while Mrs.
St. Clair said, -
“We have brought London hours to the country with us,
but we must make a reform."
“Ha! reform! yes, that's a very good word. I like the
word reform," interrupted the American. “Reform, reform,”.
repeated he, "yes, it's a good thing, is it not, my Lady? And
I will reform your fire in the first place ;" and he began to
stir and beat it in the most annoying manner, then threw
down the poker with a horrid clang, and, drawing his chair
close to the fire, he put his feet actually within the fender,
and rasped and crunched the ashes which he had scattered
all over the hearth. Lady Rossville was on the point of
rising and leaving the room, when Mrs. St. Clair crossed to
where she was sitting, and, under pretence of looking at one
of the pictures, she pressed her daughter's hand in a signifi-
cant manner, while, in a low voice, and speaking very rapidly
to Delmour in French, she said,
“I must beg your forbearance for American manners; you
will oblige me by it."
This was the first time Mrs. St. Clair had ever addressed
Colonel Delmour on easy or friendly terms; their intercourse
hitherto had been marked either by constraint or enmity, and
now, all of a sudden, she condescended to sue to him. Ger-

trude could scarcely credit her senses, and even Delmour
looked surprised, while he answered with a bow.
After sitting two or three minutes whistling, with his hands
clasping one of his knees, Lewiston started up, and pushing
back his chair in the same rude, violent manner that marked
his every action, he planted himself directly before the fire,
so as to screen it from every one else, in the manner usually
practised by vulgar ill-bred men. All this was excruciating
to Lady Rossville and Colonel Delmour, both so elegantly
quiet and refined in all their habits and movements, and they
exchanged looks with each other, as much as to say, ought
this to be endured ?
Mrs. St. Clair perceived it, and hastily said, -
“How shall we pass the evening ? Gertrude, my dear,
will you give us some music ?-Mr. Lewiston, are you fond of
music, or should you prefer cards ?"
Quite agreeable to either, ma'am ; I like a song-none of
your Italian gibberish though—and have no objections to a
game; but, by-the-bye, my Lady, can you play at draughts?
that's the game for me!”
“No, sir," was the Countess's cold laconic reply.
" That's a pity ; but I'll teach you; you have a draught-
board, surely? Ah! there's a table ---still better. Come,
my Lady," and he touched her arm.
Colonel Delmour looked as if he would have shot him.
“Excuse me, sir,” said Lady Rossville, drawing back, and
colouring with indignation.
“No, no, come away, don't be afraid, you'll soon learn,”-
and again he took hold of her.
Lady Rossville is not accustomed to be so importuned,
sir,” said Delmour, while his lip quivered with passion.
“Is Lady Rossville, sir, accustomed to have you for her
prompter ?" demanded Lewiston, fiercely.
" Colonel Delmour-Mr. Lewiston l" exclaimed Mrs. St.
Clair, in violent agitation, “I entreat-I beg—Mr. Lewis-
ton, I shall be happy to play at draughts with you; Lady
Rossville cannot play, indeed she cannot."
“ So much the better; so much the better; I like to teach
people—their duty,” added he, with an insolent smile, and
looking at Colonel Delmour.
“Another time, then," said Mrs. St. Clair; “but, for this
evening, accept of me."
“No, no, I will have my Lady," said the American, with
all the determination of unconquerable obstinacy.
“ He is either mad or drunk !” exclaimed Belmour, pas-
sionately, “and no company for you;” and, rising, he took
the Countess's hand to lead her away.

“No, sir, I am neither mad nor drunk, as you will find,"
cried Lewiston, placing himself before them;'“ but I have
something to say
“Mr. Lewiston !" cried Mrs. St. Clair, with almost a
shriek, “ for Heaven's sake-Gertrude-Colonel Delmour-
what is all this? How childish, Gertrude; I command you as
a daughter, to sit down to draughts with Mr. Lewiston."
" That's it, that's right said Lewiston, with exulta-
tion. Lady Rossville's cheeks glowed, and tears of pride and
anger stood in her eyes ; she hesitated.
"You must not,” said Delmour, impetuously. “You shall
not."
“For God's sake, obey me!" whispered her mother, in a
voice of agony; and taking her hand she led her to the
table. “Sit down, my love," whispered she, “and I will
play for you; Gertrude, have mercy upon me!" and she
wrung her daughter's hand as the Countess would have drawn
back.
“Do you submit to be so compelled ?" cried Delmour,
almost frantic with rage, at the idea of his beautiful Countess
sitting down to play at draughts with a rude, low-bred un-
known.
“ Yes, yes,” said Gertrude, moved to pity at her mother's
appeal, “I will try for once;" and she seated herself, and
Mrs. St. Clair took a chair close by her.
Lewiston, satisfied with having carried his point of getting
Lady Rossville to sit down with him, allowed Mrs. St. Clair
to play the game for her daughter. He entered into it him-
self with loud boyish delight; rubbed his hands, snapped his
fingers, swore by Jove, and by Jingo !and when he came
to the castling or crowning, always insisted that the Countess
should perform that ceremony.
“I will have all my honours from you," said he laughing;
" all-all-you shall crown me, you shall castle me-shan't
she ?” to Mrs. St. Clair, who looked the picture of wretched-
ness, though she strove to keep up with his intemperate
mirth.
“He is certainly mad !" thought Lady Rossville, and she
began to feel afraid ; she wished for Delmour, but Delmour,
in displeasure, had left the apartment, and she heard him
knocking about the billiard balls by himself, in an adjoining
Game after game was played, and won by Lewiston
with unabated energy and delight, till at last Gertrude's
patience could endure no longer, and she rose with an excla-
mation of weariness.
“Well, you have had a good lesson for one night, my
Lady, let us see how much it has cost you ;” and he began to

very well.”
count over his winnings, then putting them between his hands,
he rattled them with a glee, that, under other circumstances,
would have been ludicrous.
“Now, give us a song, my Lady, do; come, mamma," to
Mrs. St. Clair, " exert your authority-I must have a song.
Why, I haven't heard you sing yet, and I've something of a
pipe myself."
Lady Rossville has done so much for me, that I am sure
she will not refuse me this request,” said her mother, in an
imploring manner, as she took her daughter's hand and
pressed it tenderly in hers.
“I cannot sing," said Gertrude, almost choking with the
conflict of her feelings.
" What's the matter? not in tune ? never mind, you'll do
"The night is nearly over," said Mrs. St. Clair soothingly,
but in a whisper, as Lewiston, tired of chucking his money,
was busy transferring it to a large silk purse ; “your com-
pliance may prevent a quarrel."
66 Would to Heaven this were ended l" said Gertrude with
emotion, as her mother took her arm and led her into the
music-room. “Never again will I submit to what I have
this day done !" and scalding tears burst from her eyes.
“What! you seem rather piano, my Lady," said Lewiston,
looking at her with a smile ; " well, I'll give you a song,
since you won't give me one, and one of your own Scotch
ones too; I'm half a Scotchman now you know," with a wink to
Mrs. St. Clair; “ so here's for your glorious Robert Bruce!”
And he burst out with “ Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled," in
a key that made the very walls reverberate the sound. Yet,
to own the truth, he had a fine, deep, clear voice, and sung
well in a very vulgar style, with a great deal of gesticulation,
clenching of hands, stamping of feet, and suiting of the
action to the words. To that succeeded an American song,
and another, and another, in rapid succession, for his lungs
seemed inexhaustible, and he sang volumes of odious political
songs with the same vehemence and enthusiasm, till both
Mrs. St. Clair and Lady Rossville were ready to faint with
the fatigue of listening to him. The former, indeed, en-
couraged him to go on by her applause, while, at the same
time, she held her daughter's hand, and by her looks and
gestures constrained her, in spite of herself, to remain. To
add to the mortification, Delmour, attracted by the noise, had
entered the room, but with a look, expressive of his indigna-
tion and contempt, had instantly quitted it.
“Now, my Lady, I've done my part, haven't I? I have a
right to your song now; come, I must have it ; I never gave

I care
up a point in my life ; I've got a square head, and square
heads, as well as square toes, are all obstinate, at least some
people call it obstinacy-I call it firmness—and I'm firm for
your song."
“ This insolence is not to be borne !" exclaimed Lady Ross-
ville, starting up, and endeavouring to wrest her hand from
her mother's grasp, that she might leave the room ; but she
clung to her with fear and agony in every lineament. “I
will call my servants,” gasped she.
Lewiston only whistled.
“Gertrude --Gertrude !-hear me but this once—this is my
last attempt.- For such a trifle would you drive me to de-
struction ?-It will come soon enough, but not now-spare
memohl spare me now !".
“There's a pretty daughter for you, by jingo!" exclaimed
Lewiston, as the Countess stood with her face averted from
her mother, who still held her hands in spite of her efforts to
liberate them.
Lady Rossville's passion rose. " Come what may
not,” cried she; “I command that man to leave my house."
“That's easier said than done, my Lady," returned he
with the most provoking coolness" is it not, my good
Trudge ?” as he pulled his dog by the ear _“ But, come now,
give us the song, the night's wearing on;" and he was going
to have taken her arm to lead her to the instrument, when,
by a sudden effort, she freed herself from her mother's grasp,
and rushed into the adjoining room, where, throwing herself
on a seat, she almost sobbed
in the bitterness of her feelings.
Lewiston's voice loud, as if in argument, and Mrs. St. Clair's,
as if in entreaty, were distinctly heard; but they added no-
thing to Lady Rossville's emotion. In a few minutes her
mother joined her in the wildest and most violent agita-
tion.
“Gertrude," cried she, “I no longer ask your forbearance
- your mercy-I see it cannot be 1” And she wrung her
hands in agony. “To-morrow must end it-Oh, that the earth
would cover me before to-morrow !"
Violent passion has always the effect of absorbing or anni-
hilating all inferior degrees of excitement, and Lady Rossville
was gradually composed at sight of her mother's real despair.
She would ven have tried to soothe her, but at that moment
Lewiston entered as if nothing had happened.
“Well, you have made a fine row," said he, addressing
Gertrude, " and all for what? Because I asked you to sing
a song! You must be deucedly thin-skinned, my Lady, to
fly off like a witch in a storm for that; you've something to
learn yet, I can tell you."

" She will learn all soon enough,” said Mrs. St. Clair
gloomily, “to-morrow_but let this night pass over-
“ Not without some supper, I hope."
Refreshments were ordered, and, at the same time, Delmour
made his appearance, with evident traces of ill-humour visible
on his countenance. But Lady Rossville felt too happy to
see him, on any terms, to resent his behaviour; there was
protection—there seemed even a propriety in his presence-
and her looks brightened, and her tears passed away, when
he came and placed himself by her in a manner to screen
Lewiston from her sight, who was on the opposite side of the
room making a noise with his dog.
“ You have passed a gay, and, of course, a pleasant even-
ing," said he, in a bitter, ironical tone ; one of your guests,
at least, has no cause to complain of lack of courtesy."
"OhDelmour," said Gertrude in a tone of wretchedness,
“ do not add to my unhappiness by your reproaches; it is
unkind when you see me thus "and her heart swelled al-
most to suffocation.
" It is degrading to you and myself to suffer this," cried
he passionately. This instant I will end it by ordering that
fellow from your presence." And he made a movement to-
wards Lewiston-Gertrude caught his arm.
" No-not now. Suffer him for a little longer-to-morrow
is to end it-if he does not leave this house to-morrow-
she stopped, a faint red tinged her cheek as she gave her
hand to Delmour, and said—" you shall take me from it.”
“Pray Heaven he may remain then,” said Delmour ear-
nestly, “if upon these terms you will indeed be mine !"
Gertrude only sighed ; but it was her firm determination,
unless this mystery was cleared up, and Lewiston left the
house, to throw herself on the protection of her guardian,
Lord Millbank, and, holding herself absolved from her pro-
mise to her mother, there to have her marriage with Colonel
Delmour solemnised.
On Delmour's side the suspicion was, that Mrs. St. Clair
was privately married to Lewiston, and much as his pride
revolted from such a connection, still his interest might bene-
fit by it. Lady Rossville would instantly emancipate herself
from her mother's authority, and give him a legal right to
protect her; and it would be easy to get rid of the couple,
by agreeing to settle something upon them, provided they
retired to America for life.

TAE INHERITANCR.
CHAPTER LXVII.
WHEN Lady Rossville awoke, one subject naturally engrossed
her mind to the utter exclusion of every other. This was the
day of her cousin Anne's marriage, and she had promised to
be present; but the thoughts of that never once occurred to
her-everything was absorbed in the intense interest she felt
as to the disclosure that was to take place, or, failing that,
the strong measure which she had determined upon as to her
own disposal. Upon leaving her own apartment, she hasten-
ed to her mother's, but the door was fastened-she knocked
repeatedly, but no answer was returned—she listened-all
was silent-her heart trembled within her, and she was on
the point of calling out, when she bethought her of a back-stair
communicating with the dressing-room, by which she might
probably gain access. She was not disappointed—the door
was open, and she entered her mother's bed-room ; but it
was dark, except here and there where a bright ray of sun-
shine chequered the floor, and the candles, which had been
burning all night, cast a sickly gleam as they died away
in their sockets. Gertrude hastily withdrew a window-cur-
tain, and opened a shutter, and there discovered her mother
asleep in an arm-chair, in the dress she had worn the pre-
ceding evening, and which formed an unnatural contrast with
her situation and appearance.
A phial, marked Laudanum, stood on a table by her, and it
was evident that she owed her sleep to medicine, not to na-
ture. Such as it was, it was certainly not rest that she en-
joyed, for she was disturbed and agitated, sighed heavily,
and muttered some unintelligible words, as if in an agony,
and Gertrude's name was once or twice pronounced with a
kind of shriek. Shocked beyond expression at beholding
her mother thus haunted by her sense of wretchedness even
in sleep, Lady Rossville felt it would be humanity to rouse
her from such a state, and after a while she succeeded. Mrs.
St. Clair opened her eyes, but it was some time before she
came to her recollection, or that her daughter could make
her comprehend perfectly how and where she was.
"I fear, mamma, you have taken too much laudanum,"
said she in alarm, as she looked at the bottle.
“Too much-and yet not enough," answered her mother
with a sigh.
“Allow me to send for Dr. Bruce, cried the Countess

in increasing agitation; you are ill, mamma, indeed you
are ;” as she pressed her mother's burning hand in hers.
“I shall soon be better," said Mrs. St. Clair with a still
deeper sigh. " What time is it ?-I have been asleep, I be-
lieve-shall we sup?” as she looked upon her dress with a
bewildered eye.
O, mamma, suffer yourself to be undressed, and put to
bed."
“No--I will go to—to breakfast, is it ?-yes, I remember
now, to breakfast," as she looked up to a blazing sun, then
turned to a mirror—" Will my dress do, Gertrude ?"
Lady Rossville was too much shocked to reply, for the
contrast was frightful between her mother's gay, handsome
dress, and her parched lips, haggard cheeks, and distended
eye-balls.
“The air will revive you, mamma," said she, as she led her
mother to the window, and threw it open; but the lovely
landscape seemed as though it smiled in scorn upon her, for
all things looked fresh, and renovated, and happy. Mrs. St.
Clair sat for some time with her head resting on her hand;
at length, she suddenly looked up, and said abruptly, “ You
are very fond of Rossville, are you not, Gertrude ?"
“O1 it is Paradise to me," said the Countess, as she looked
on her towering woods and far-spreading domain; “but why
do you ask, mamma?”
" Then you will never part with it?" cried Mrs. St. Clair,
in a tone of wild interrogation.
“Never-never !" exclaimed Lady Rossville, emphatically;
then, recalled to her mother's situation, she said in a soothing
voice, —“Do, mamma, allow me to ring for Lisle undress
you-it will refresh you."
“And what then?” interrupted Mrs. St. Clair ; “but I
know what I have to do-yet I would see that man once more
before-perhaps-yes- I will—ring for Lisle then;" and she
began impatiently to tear, rather than to take off her orna-
ments. * Now, go-leave me e-why do you stand there look-
ing upon me?” cried she, angrily.
Lady Rossville burst into tears. “It is distracting to me
to see you thus, mamma, and to think I am perhaps the

no perhaps—you are the cause."

do all

Mrs. St. Clair, impatiently; "all but obedience and forbear-
ance--all but duty and patience-all but love and tenderness,

Answer me then, once for all ; 'tis for the last time I put the
question; its consequences be upon your own head. Can
you-will you be guided by me in your behaviour to Lewis-
ton?"
"I cannot," said Lady Rossville, in an agony of grief.
“ Then go," cried her mother, ringing the bell violently for
her maid — "not another word ; if your fate is sealed, do not
blame me ;" then, as her maid entered, she waved her hand
for her daughter to leave her, and Gertrude withdrew, afraid
to irritate her by farther opposition.
“What can this dreadful mystery be?" was the question
that had naturally presented itself at every turning of her
mind, till thought had been lost in the mazes of conjecture.
The idea which most frequently occurred was, that her
mother must have been previously married to Lewiston, and,
in the belief of his death, had become the wife of St. Clair.
But then his youthful appearance ill accorded with such a
supposition ; indeed, seemed to render it altogether impos-
sible; and again the idea was rejected for others which were
no less improbable. “Be it what it may,” thought she,
“this day must end it;" and at that moment, in crossing the
hall, she suddenly encountered the object of her dread and
her wonder. He looked heated and ruffled, as if he had
been engaged in a squabble. “So," said he, seizing her
hand before she was aware, and looking earnestly in her
face, which bore traces of her agitation;
have been
with the old lady, I see! Well, has she let the cat out of
the bag, or has she left it to me?”
Some of the servants just then entered the hall, and Lady
Rossville, without answering, passed on to the saloon, where
she hoped to find Delmour; but he was not there. Lewis-
ton followed, and again began-
“What, all in the dark yet? what's the old lady about?
But, by Jove ! I'll not wait another day to be treated as I
have been by you and your confounded rapscallions. But
I've given one of your grooms, as you call them, a settler.
I've given him a bit of a knob on the side of his head, to
keep him in mind of his duty; and I'll have them all broke
in for you, by-and-bye ; a set of lazy, insolent, eating and
drinking scoundrels that you keep about you, and one of
these low-lived rascals to pretend to pass off his airs to a
gentleman like me
“This is past all bearing !" cried Lady Rossville, as her
face flushed with shame and indignation at having been thus
disgraced to her servants ; “Ť command you instantly to
quit my house, or my servants shall compel you to it;" and
she stretched out her hand to ring the bell. Lewiston has-

tily snatched it, and looked at her with an expression which
made her tremble even in spite of her resentment.
“Do you know who it is you are speaking to ?"
“I neither know nor care," said the Countess, while her
heart beat as though it would have burst. Lewiston was silent
for a minute; he then said abruptly, but in some agitation, -
“What if I am your father?"
Gertrude gazed upon him with a look almost bordering on
idiocy; her lips were apart, but no sound came from them.
“It's very true though; ask the old lady, her you call your
mother, if it ain't; she'll confess it, that she will. She'll tell
you you're no more Countess of Rossville than I am ; you're
the daughter of Jacob Lewiston here ; and your nurse
But Gertrude could hear no more ; she had fainted.
“ The deuce !” exclaimed he, in some consternation at this
unlooked-for result. • Why, I'd better have let the old one
manage it in her own way, after all ;" and, ringing the bell, he
desired the servant to fetch Mrs. St. Clair cleverly, for that
her Ladyship the Countess was in a fit. The alarm was in-
stantly communicated, and the whole house was presently in
commotion.

CHAPTER LXVIII.
LONG ere Gertrude had power to unclose her eyes the frantic
exclamations of her lover had pierced her ear, as he hung
over her in an agony of apprehension; and joy sent the first
faint blush to her cheek, and spoke in the look with which
she met his anxious gaze. For a moment all was forgotten
by her, or rather seemed as a hideous dream, and Delmour,
kneeling by her side in all the agitation of love and fear, was
the only image that presented itself.
“I hope, my Lady, your Ladyship feels better," said Lewis-
ton, thrusting himself forward; but at the sound of his
voice, a deadly paleness again overspread her face, and her
senses forsook her.
“Will none of you drag that madman away?" cried Del-
mour, passionately, to some of the servants, who were bustling
pompously about with glasses and decanters.
“No-no-no," shrieked Mrs. St. Clair, throwing herself
between Lewiston and them, as they approached him ;
“ Marshall-Jourdain-on your peril touch him."
“Send instantly for advice," *cried Delmour, wildly, as
Gertrude's lifeless hand grew colder even in his grasp

you stand there ? By Heaven! she will be gone and,
snatching every restorative offered by the housekeeper and
lady's maids, he would administer them himself. Once more
Gertrude slowly opened her eyes, and again they rested on
her lover.
" It was-all-a dream-was it not ?" said she, in a low
gasping voice.
"Ah! our Countess is herself again,” cried Lewiston, in a
loud significant tone, as much as to say, “ Keep your own
secret.'
“Protect me!" murmured she, as she convulsively held
Delmour's hand, and again relapsed into a death-like swoon.
“For Heaven's sake, retire!" cried Mrs. St. Clair to Lewis-
ton, dreading some scene of violence when Delmour should
extricate himself from Gertrude's unconscious grasp-"only
to the next room, till this is over; if," added she in a whisper
_"if you would prevent discovery, go _" and she led him
to an adjoining room, and shut the door. Once more Ger-
trude's marble features showed signs of returning life ; but
she neither spoke nor opened her eyes ; she remained mo-
tionless, as if unwilling to be scared by sight or sound, or
aught that could break the death-like repose in which she lay.
“ Lady Rossville-dearest _" exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair,
as she would have lifted her hand; but when she spoke, a
tremor shook Gertrude's whole frame, and she recoiled from
her touch with a shudder.
“Gertrude-my life I suffer Mrs. Roberts and Masham to
assist you to your dressing-room-you will be quieter there
-no one shall enter but those you wish to see; they shall
not, indeed, my angel."
But a low convulsive sigh was Gertrude's only answer.
“Gertrude-speak to me-say what it is that has alarmed
you; tell me what you wish, and it shall be done,” cried
Delmour, in an accent of grief and tenderness, which seemed
to thrill to her heart. “ Shall I order the carriage to take
you to Lord Millbank's ? " added he in a low voice.
“0-no-no," cried she, putting her hands to her face.
“ Colonel Delmour, I must entreat that you will not thus
agitate Lady Rossville,” cried Mrs. St. Clair; “this is neither
a time nor a place for such questions; when she has had a
little quiet repose in her own apartment-
“I will not lose sight of her again," interrupted Delmour,
passionately, “ till I see her in safer hands than any here."
“ This is tor much,” cried Mrs. St. Clair, struggling to
preserve her c posure; and dreading every instant lest the
disclosure (wh.ch she at once perceived had taken place)
should buret from Gertrude's lips, if Delmour persisted in

313
talking to her ; “but I submit-suffer her to be removed to
her own apartment, with Mrs. Roberts and Masham to attend
upon her till this nervous attack has subsided, and I consent
to remain here till the arrival of Dr. Bruce."
Delmour could not object to this arrangement, for Mrs.
Roberts was a discreet and respectable person in her way,
and
both she and Masham were devoted to their lady; he there-
fore consented, and she was accordingly conveyed there, and
left to the care of her two faithful attendants, who received
the strictest injunctions upon no account to speak to her. Mrs.
St. Clair felt secure, that, unless in a fit of delirium, she would
not betray herself to them, and if, in that state, she did drop
anything of the truth, it would all pass for the raving of
fever. Gertrude was therefore left to silence and to darkness,
while Mrs. St. Clair and Colonel Delmour, by a sort of mutual
understanding, seemed resolved not to lose sight of each
other. He, indeed, was bent upon more than that-he was
determined that instant to force an explanation of the mys-
tery, which involved such a person as Lewiston (and that in
no common way) in the family concerns of Lady Rossville ;
and, ringing the bell, he ordered the servant to inform Mr.
Lewiston, who was in the next room, that his presence was
desired in the saloon.
At this message, Mrs. St. Clair turned pale and trembled ;
she rose from her seat; she would have stopped the servant,
but she knew not what to say, and before she could summon
recollection, Lewiston entered, and her confidence returned at
sight of his free unabashed air.
"Well,” said he, accosting Mrs. St. Clair with an air of
freedom; “ you see I am yours to go and to come; but what
have you made of my Lady?"
“You are not here to ask questions, but to answer them,
sir,” said Delmour, his lip quivering with passion. “I insist
upon knowing by what right you have intruded yourself into
this house."
“I must first know what right you have to ask the ques-
tion," retorted the other, boldly.
“Colonel Delmour," exclaimed Mrs. St. Clair eagerly, as
she saw his flashing eyes, and dreaded some act of violence-
* Mr. Lewiston is a friend of the family; he is my friend,
that is enough-
“ Your friend !" repeated Delmour contemptuously, “ that
is indeed enough, quite enough, to warrant Lady Rossville
seeking other protection.” He rang the bell furiously-"De-
sire Lady Rossville's travelling-carriage and my riding-
horses to be ready at a minute's warning," called he to the
servant.
"

THE INHERITANCE.
“Hark ye, my man, there's no hurry about the first,” cried
the intolerable Lewiston—"we shall have two words about
that yet, by Jove !"
But the servant, evidently disregarding him, bowed his
acquiescence to Delmour, and withdrew.
" What is the meaning of this, Colonel Delmour ? " cried
Mrs. St. Clair, in the most violent agitation.
Delmour endeavoured to speak coolly while he said
“It was settled last night, by Lady Rossville, that while
Mrs. St. Clair's unknown friend remained here, this was no
fit residence for her.-She leaves it, therefore, for the pro-
tection of her guardian, Lord Millbank; and when Dr. Bruce
arrives, I intend that he shall accompany her.” And he
looked with the sort of resolute indifference of one whose
determination could not be affected by any circumstances.
“This is the most extraordinary proceeding, Colonel Del-
mour,” said Mrs. St. Clair, pale and trembling.--"You can
have no authority for such interference in my in Lady
Rossville's situation, to take her from her own house, from
my protection; it shall not be.”
“No, faith, by Jove! she shall not stir a foot from this
house to-day,” cried Lewiston, nor any day without the
leave of those who have something of a better right to dic-
tate to her Ladyship than you have, sir," and he nodded to
Mrs. St. Clair, as if to encourage her.
Delmour's passion was at its climax, and he could no longer
suppress it.
"What is this infernal mystery," cried he to Mrs. St. Clair,
" which allows such a person to dare to talk in this manner?
I will know it; something at the bottom of all this ; if-
and he seemed almost choked to utter it" if this man is, as
I suspect, your husband-
“No; oh, no!” shrieked Mrs. St. Clair, wildly.
“Well, and if I am the lady's husband, sir, what then?
What is your objection to me, sir? My Lady Countess's
proud stomach, it seems, can't put up with me for her father;
but what is that to you? you're not my lord yet, and one
gentleman's as good's another."
" Colonel Delmour-oh, no-help me I am not~I~"ex-
claimed Mrs. St. Clair, in a state of distraction, at finding
herself caught in such horrible toils. But again Lewiston
interposed, Come, come, 'tis of no use to deny it now; the
thing's over, and my Lady will come to herself by-and-bye,
when she finds she can't make a better of it; there, I told
you--" as a servant entered, to say that his lady wished to
see Mrs. St. Clair immediately.

315
Delmour, who had been pacing the room in a perfect tumult
of passion, stopped short at this, and demanded of the servant
who had brought this message ?
“ Miss Masham, sir,” was the reply.
" Then desire Miss Masham to come and deliver it herself,
sir,” cried he, fiercely: and Masham, not without fear and
trembling, confirmed the fact. He then abruptly quitted the
room to traverse the gallery opposite the Countess's apart-
ment, and see that no one else obtained entrance.
At sight of Mrs. St. Clair, all Gertrude's tremors returned
upon her, and again she relapsed into successive fainting fits,
from which her attendants with difficulty recovered her. At
length she became more composed, whether from strength or
weakness, and, in a faint voice, inquired for Mrs. St. Clair,
who, conscious of the impression she made upon the victim of
her guilt, had retired out of sight.
“Mrs. St. Clair is there, my Lady," whispered Mrs.
Roberts.
" Then leave me, Roberts. Masham, go; I will ring when
I want you."
But they still lingered.
“ Colonel Delmour, my Lady, forbade that we should lose
sight of your Ladyship, upon any account, till the Doctor's
arrival."
“Colonel Delmour !" repeated Gertrude.—“Ah!"_and
tears, the first she had shed, burst from her eyes; they gave
her a temporary relief, and she, with some difficulty, dis-
missed her faithful attendants, and Mrs. St. Clair once more
approached her. Many and bitter were the tears shed on
both sides before either had power to utter a syllable. At
length Mrs. St. Clair said, -
"Can you forgive me, Gertrude ?"
But Gertrude only turned away her head and wept the
more; then suddenly looking up, by a violent effort she stopped
her tears; and, while they yet hung round her eyes, and her
pale lips quivered, she said,
" Tell me all-
Oh, not now; spare yourself, spare me," cried Mrs. St.
Clair, with a fresh burst of weeping.
“ No, no, there is nothing to spare; say that it is not
that he -” and again she seemed as though she would have
fainted, as the thoughts of Lewiston, her father, rushed
upon
her.
Oh, tell me all; I must, I will know all!" And Mrs. St.
Clair was obliged to commence a broken and weeping narra-
tive of the events of her early days.

CHAPTER LXIX.
She dwelt upon the injurious and exasperating treatment she
had received from the Rossville family, as though she sought in
their conduct an excuse, or at least a palliation, for her own.
She spoke of the exile and the poverty in which she had for so
many years dragged out a joyless existence-of her husband's
disinheritance-of the utter hopeless insignificance of their
lot as outcast childless annuitants on the one hand, or the bril-
liant destiny which seemed to court them on the other, where
riches and honours awaited them in the person of their
offspring.
“It was at this time," continued the wretched narrator of
her own guilt, “that accident brought me acquainted with-
with Marian La Motte-
“ With my mother, was she not?” interrupted Gertrude, in
a voice of repressed agony. Mrs. St. Clair's only answer
was a burst of tears. Gertrude hid her face on the cushion of
the couch on which she lay, and, without looking up, in the
same tone said, “Go on-tell me all."
“In her I discovered the daughter of Lizzie Lundie, whose
name and history had been familiar to me in my younger
days. She had emigrated to America with her husband, and
upon his death had married a French Canadian-Marian was
the child of that union, but at this time her parents were
both dead, and she was the wi of Jacob Lewiston, an Ame-
rican trader, whom she had accompanied to Bourdeaux. She
was then in absolute want, for his vessel had been wrecked,
and the whole cargo lost; but, at the time I became acquainted
with them, he obtained a situation on board a merchantman
and went to sea again, leaving his wife in delicate health to
earn her livelihood as she best could till his return. To com-
plete her wretchedness she looked forward to giving birth to
Here Mrs. St. Clair stopped, overcome with her feelings,
then, suddenly seizing Gertrude's hands-
" Gertrude! Gertrude! God knows I had then no evil
thoughts! I had not, indeed; but when she besought me on
her knees, that if she should die a stranger in a strange land,
and leave an orphan baby, I would be as a mother to it;
oh, then the tempter assailed me !"

6 Oh, Gertrude, do not tear my heart by forcing me to re-
trace what can be of no avail—what can it signify, now, to
tell you of the thoughts, the fears, the struggles I endured
myself, of the arguments and entreaties I used with her and
my husband to induce them to co-operate in my schemes ? It
is enough to tell you that it was done that we quitted Bour-
deaux on pretence of returning to Scotland, and that at Ba-
gnolet you were brought into the world as the heiress of Ross-
ville—and such you still are, Gertrude—the secret is known
but to yourself, and those who
“Hush !” exclaimed Gertrude, wildly, and with a shudder.
" There cannot be the possibility of discovery if you will
but-
"You have not told me all,” cried Gertrude, hurriedly.
“Gertrude, I will not survive the shame—the infamy-
“Tell me all-all quickly. Why did he leave her? Why
has he so long ?-it is about him," gasped she, “I would
know."
" From the day that he left her his wife never heard any
tidings of him, and we at last naturally concluded he had
perished at sea. Still there was no positive certainty of this
being the case, and she always cherished the hope of seeing
him again, for she loved him, Gertrude, indeed she did.” But
Gertrude only wept the more to think that she could not love
her father.
“Your mother, oh, Gertrude, how dreadful is it to me to
call another by that title !" and again Mrs. St. Clair wept
long and bitterly, then went on-"Your mother had been
long threatened with a consumption, and when she found her-
self dying, she had, it seems, unknown to me, written a letter
containing the secret of your birth, which she had had at-
tested by her priest (for you know she was a Catholic); this
she confided to his care, receiving his solemn promise in re-
turn never to divulge its contents, or part with it to another
than Jacob Ruxton Lewiston of Perth-Amboy, New Jersey.
“ Years after this man went to America as a missionary ;
and there, alas ! it was our evil fortune that he should find
your father! I need not tell you that he came immediately to
Britain to claim you. You must well remember our first
meeting, and the mysterious interviews that followed — he
would even then have made himself known to you, that he
might have established his authority over you; but I pre-
vailed upon him to forego his claims at least till the Earl's
death. Oh! had he known you as I do he would never have
dared the disclosure—but you will not, Gertrude—you can-
not be so infatuated—he is your father, as such he is entitled
to your duty, your obedience-

“Now-now-no more,” cried Gertrude, covering her face
with her hands.
“ Gertrude only say you will not be so mad—for Heaven's
sake, promise me you will not. Gertrude, he threatens to
carry you off to America should you drop a hint of -Oh! for
the love of Heaven, be calm—think of your mother, You

“My mother ! Oh, how could she sell her child l”exclaimed
Gertrude, wringing her hands in an agony.
“She did not sell you, Gertrude. Never mother loved her
child as she doated upon you. While she lived you may re-
member you were never out of her sight-worlds would not
have bribed her to have parted with you—and now could she
see you thus great, and-
“Oh! that she had suffered me to remain the beggar I was
born !"
“Do not talk thus, dearest Gertrude, if you would not kill
me; compose yourself, and all will yet be well-it will in-
deed-your father"
“ Do not-oh! do not call him-oh, God I forgive me,
wretch that I am !” exclaimed she, almost frantic with horror
at herself for so abhorring his name.
“Well, your mother, my dearest think of her-think how
you loved her-had she lived you would not have shamed her
with this disclosure. You will not bring disgrace upon her
memory." And Gertrude wept softer tears as she called
to mind the well-remembered proofs of her mother's
love.
“ How could she do it ?” cried she again, roused to agony.
"Ah, Gertrudel can you wonder the temptation was too
strong to be resisted? Consider how we were both situated.
You could bring nothing but additional care and poverty to
her—to me you would ensure riches and honour-do not con-
demn us.
Gertrude, say you forgive me?"
Gertrude's whole frame shook with emotion, but she re-
mained silent.
“ Gertrude - Gertrude !" cried Mrs. St. Clair, seizing her
bands, “have I not been as a mother to you—will you not
say you forgive me?”
“I cannot !" gasped Gertrude, in a wild suffocating voice,
and she turned shuddering away.
Her maid now entered to announce the arrival of Dr.
Bruce, adding, that Colonel Delmour hoped her Ladyship
would see the Doctor without delay.
“ Lady Rossville will ring when she is ready," said Mrs. St.
Clair, in violent agitation; then when Masham withdrew, she
cried, “ Gertrude, you will not betray yourself to Dr. Bruce!

promise me-promise me that, for the love of Heaven !” and
she wrung her hand.
" To him !" repeated Gertrude ; " no, I will not see him
at all, why should I? 'tis a mockery-leave me-leave me to
myself," cried she, with a fresh burst of grief.
But just then Masham returned to say that Colonel Del-
mour was very impatient for her Ladyship to see the Doctor ;
and as she spoke Delmour's voice was heard outside the door.
At the dear loved sound, again Gertrude's pale cheek glowed
for a moment, and her eyes brightened, but in another in-
stant she dropped her head with an air of hopeless dejection
--and Dr. Bruce was now ushered in.
Mrs. St. Clair anticipated all questions by taking the Doctor
apart, and telling him candidly, as she called it, that the
Countess was suffering under a severe nervous attack, and
that something of a composing nature was what was wanted.
Gertrude was, therefore, spared answering any questions,
and having felt her pulse, administered some drops, and re-
commended quietness, the Doctor withdrew to make his re-
port to Delmour, who was impatiently waiting for him. Mrs.
St. Clair, at the same time, hastened to Lewiston to prevent
him, if possible, from doing more mischief, and Gertrude was
once more left to the care of her attendants, who imagined
she slept, from the still and silent state in which she lay.
CHAPTER LXX.
But sleep was far from Gertrude's eyelids; and in the multi-
titude of her thoughts within her, she felt as though she
should never know repose again. Her very soul sickened,
and her brain whirled at the horrible destiny just opened to
her: to fall from her high estate to a condition so vile and
abject-instead of the heiress of a mighty house, the daugh-
ter of a noble line-to be a beggar, an impostor, the child of
one against whom her whole being revolted ! Yet voluntarily
to proclaim this to the world—to stand forth a mark for the
finger of scorn to point at-to be laughed at by some, despised,
by others—to leave each thing beloved most dearly—to become
an outcast-an alien-could she do this, and live ? No, she
would pass away in secret—she would consume her days in
grief and in penitence-she would abjure, renounce, fly all
that she had loved and enjoyed—she would dwell in darkness
and in solitude-few and sad would be her days, but she would
go down to the grave as Countess of Rossville-her “soul was

ready to choose strangling rather than life," for what had life
now to offer to her of good or fair ? Delmour -ah I there
her heart trembled within her ; this day she had promised to
be his! At that instant a note was delivered to her, which
Colonel Delmour himself had brought to the door of her
apartment, and insisted on its being instantly delivered.
“I claim your promise, dearest Gertrude-Dr. Bruce is of
opinion you may be removed to Millbank with perfect safety
- if you wish it, he and Masham will accompany you in the
carriage, and I shall attend it ; say but yes, my angel, to your
adoring F. D.”
Here was a fresh wave of misery to overwhelm the un-
happy Gertrude! The cup of happiness was held to her lips
by the hand she loved, and she herself must dash it to the
ground for ever! Poor, low-born, degraded as she was, what
a bride for the proud, high-minded Delmour!
“And Delmour-would even Delmour despise and reject
me if he knew all !" thought she, as, for a moment, she co-
vered her face with her hands, and bowed beneath the humilia-
tion. But soon a loftier feeling succeeded. "No," thought
she, as a bitter pang shot through her heart, “if we must
part, it shall be nobly; he shall learn all from myself. He
loves me, and he will love me still-but he loved me as Coun-
tess of Rossville-he must now love me as an outcast, a beg-
gar-
She desired her maid to say to Colonel Delmour that she
would see him in the library; then, rising, she bathed her
eyes, and adjusted her hair, and endeavoured to dispel, as
much as possible, the traces of grief and agitation from her
face.
“I will not go to him a weeping supplicant!" thought she,
“I will owe nothing to his pity," and she repressed each
rising emotion, and with a calm and lofty air, entered the
apartment where her lover awaited her. But what a change
had a few hours of intense suffering made upon her! Her
mutable countenance had now all the fixedness and the pale-
ness of marble, and those eyes, those lovely eyes, which had
so often met him with smiles, and which always " seemed to
love whate'er they looked upon," now heavy and brimful,
drooped beneath the weight of her swollen eyelids.
“ Gertrude, my own, my adored,” cried 'Delmour, as he
took her passive hand, and led her to a seat>"Speak to me,
dearest, it is death to me to see you thus.”
Gertrude opened her lips, and vainly tried to articulate ; but
her tongue seemed to cleave to her mouth.
“This is dreadful—it will kill you to remain in this house
- you must leave it, indeed you must, my love; your carriage

is ready, suffer me to order it," and he was going to ring the
bell, when Gertrude laid her hand upon his arm. Again she
strove to speak, but a sigh, so deep, so sad, burst from her
heart, as told the unutterable anguish of her soul.
“Gertrude! my life !” exclaimed Delmour, terror-struck,
as he felt her hand grow colder, and saw her features gradu-
ally becoming more rigid: “for God's sake, speak to me.”
Gertrude spoke, but her voice was so changed, that Del-
mour started at the sound.
“You love me, Delmour-I know you do—and —but no
matter-I never can be yours now,
-Delmour, I have a
strange, a frightful tale to tell you—I-I am not what I seem
-I am not Countess of Rossville—I am a beggar!" She hid
her face for a moment, while Delmour, too much amazed to
answer, remained silent.
" It is true—they have told me all, all, all—I am his daugh-
ter—he is my father," and her voice grew wilder in her at-
tempts to speak calmly and firmly.
“My dearest Gertrude, you take this matter too violently ;
although your mother has made a degrading marriage, that
ought not to affect you in this manner; it does not interfere
with your rights, or diminish my attachment to you—why
then
“Ah! Delmour, you are deceived-she is not mother-
I am his daughter—the daughter of Jacob Lewiston—I have
been an usurper, but I did not know it."
The dreadful truth now flashed upon Delmour, with the
force and the rapidity of a stroke of lightning, and he re-
mained horror-struck beneath its shock. For some minutes
neither of them spoke, but Gertrude's breast heaved with agi-
tation she would not betray, and her eyes were distended in
endeavours to retain her tears within the brim.
“Good God !" at length exclaimed Delmour, striking his
forehead in a distracted manner—"Gertrude, dearest Ger-
trude !" and he seized her hands. “No, it cannot be, you are
mine, my own
“Not now, Delmour," said Gertrude, and her heart almost
broke, in the effort to appear calm in resigning him.
now you are free !” added she, in an accent of despair.
“Free! Oh! Gertrude, my life !" and he paced the room
with disordered steps, then suddenly stopping, “ No, you must
-you shall be mine– I will not believe it—by Heaven 'tis
false ! you, you the daughter of that-
“Oh! he is my father !" cried Gertrude, shuddering.
“ No, there is some infernal plot at the bottom of this—it
shall be cleared up," and he was hurrying towards the door,
when Gertrude called to him

Stay, Delmour ; 'tis from me you shall hear it all-I will
not that you should hear it from another, that you have loved
an impostor, a beggar," and with desperate energy, she reca-
pitulated to him the evidence of her birth, as detailed by Mrs.
St. Clair. When she had ended, Delmour said nothing, but
he buried his face in his handkerchief, as in an agony of grief,
and Gertrude's high-wrought fortitude almost forsook her, as
she beheld her lover thus overcome; she felt she could not
long support the continuance of the scene, and she said
"Now I have told you all, Delmour-I am no longer what
I have been—from this hour let my shame, my disgrace, be
proclaimed, and- let us part."
“Gertrude, if you would not drive me mad, do not! Oh!
you know not how I love-how I adore you !" and he pressed
her hands to his lips, and Gertrude felt his burning tears fall
upon them, and every drop was as a life-drop from her heart.
“ Gertrude !” exclaimed he passionately,
you have never
loved as I do, or you could not be thus unmoved."
A faint smile of anguish was on Gertrude's pale lip, and a
single tear rolled slowly down her bloodless cheek.
Again a long and bitter pause ensued. Delmour still held
her hands in his, while he seemed to struggle with contend-
ing emotions. Suddenly Lewiston's loud voice was heard,
as if issuing some orders in his usual authoritative tone. The
blood rushed to Delmour's face-he started up, and dropped
the hands he had but a moment before clasped in his own-
Gertrude, too, rose-cold drops were upon her brow, and she
shook in every joint, but by a desperate effort she gained
the door. She thought she heard her name pronounced by
Delmour in an accent of tenderness and despair, but a thou-
sand sounds were ringing in her ears, a thousand figures were
before her eyes, and she only reached her own apartment
when all sights and sounds had vanished, for she had fainted.
CHAPTER LXXI.
DELMOUR's whole mind was a chaos of conflicting passions.
That he loved was undoubted, but his love was compounded
of many ingredients-pride, vanity, ambition, self-interest -
and now all these were up in arms to oppose each purer
or more generous sentiment that might have found place in
his heart. In this state of excitation he sought Mrs. St.
Clair, who was yet ignorant of what had passed in her
absence; but Delmour's disordered looks, and wild, incoherent

323
expressions soon proclaimed that all was disclosed. To deny
or prevaricate she felt would be in vain-the terrors of guilt
and of shame were upon her-infamy and ruin had overtaken
her. There was nothing left to suspicion or conjecture-the
evidence was infallible - it was her own. Still, while her
very soul sank beneath the weight of her crime, her proud
spirit refused to humble itself before the man she hated; and
her only reply to his reproaches and invectives was, that he
would now have an opportunity of proving the sincerity and
the disinterestedness of his attachment.
More than ever exasperated, Delmour hastened from her to
shut himself up in his own apartment. Distracted at the
thoughts of the evil which had come upon him, his soul was
tossed in a whirlwind of contending passions. To resign
Gertrude-his own beautiful, his betrothed Gertrude—there
was despair in the thought; but to marry the descendant of
the huntsman—the daughter of Lewiston-it was madness to
dream of such degradation! Innocent as she was in herself,
there was a stigma affixed to her name which never could be
effaced—a changeling ! the child of wretchedness and impos-
ture! No!-he never could dishonour himself and his family
by such an alliance. Then the image of Gertrude, rich in
native loveliness—the tender, confiding, noble-minded Ger-
trude-rose to view, as if to mock the littleness of that pride
that would have spurned her.
Delmour passed a sleepless night, and the morning found
him resolved to renounce Gertrude for ever! But how to do
it was the difficulty—to see her again was impossible. He
attempted to write to her, but could not. He felt that he was
about to pierce a heart which beat but for him, and his hand
shrank from the barbarous task. But something must be
done. It was impossible that Lewiston and he could remain
under one roof; he shuddered at the thoughts of meeting
him-meeting him as the father of Gertrude—the man who,
but for her disclosure, might even now have been his father-
in-law; yet to order him from the house would be to turn
Gertrude also from the home which but yesterday she had
held as her own, and that was too cruel even for Delmour's
selfish heart. The result of his deliberations was, that he
would leave things as they were, and repair to London to
consult with his brother upon what ought to be done; and
having formed this resolution, he wrote as follows, to
Gertrude :-
DEAREST, ADORED GERTRUDE,
“I will not attempt to paint to you what I have
suffered since that sad disclosure took place. Would to

Heaven it were in my power to raise you to that height from
which you have fallen, or rather from which you have so
nobly cast yourself; but, alas ! my beloved, by uniting your
fate with mine, I should only involve you in deeper ruin. I
have neither wealth nor power to bear you through this over-
whelming tide of misfortune ; and yet to lose you-voluntarily
to renounce one a thousand times dearer to me than my own
existence.—No, Gertrude, I cannot, I will not resign you-
mine you are in soul and in love—are you not, Gertrude ?
You never can love another; and what other ever could
love you as I have done? My brain is on fire-I scarcely
know what I write, but you will understand me, dearest, most
beloved -It is better that we should not meet. I will
depart, but you shall remain here as mistress for the
present. I will see my brother; but until then, let nothing
more be said on this heart-rending disclosure. Farewell,
dearest-pity your distressed, but adoring,

case.
Meanwhile, Gertrude had remained in a state of morbid
woe, infinitely more alarming than the wildest ebullitions
of grief. She neither spoke nor wept, but remained silent
and passive, her glassy eyes fixed on vacancy, and her ear
unconscious of every sound.
When Delmour's note was brought to her, she closed her
eyes, and turned her head away from it—while she thought,
" It is all over-he has cast me from him !"
" It is from Colonel Delmour, my Lady,” said Masham,
soothingly, who concluded there was a lover's quarrel in the
"He is most petiklarly anxious to hear how your
Ladyship is this morning."
Still her Lady remained motionless.
“The Colonel looks so ill, my Lady, I'm sure it will
break his heart entirely if your Ladyship does not take his
letter.'
A deep sigh burst from Gertrude's heart ; but Masham
hailed it as a happy omen, and went on.
“Dear, my Lady, if you did but see the Colonel, I don't
think you'd have known him. His face, my Lady, is as white
as your handkerchief, and his beautiful eyes, my Lady, quite
red, for all the world as he had been crying ; indeed, my
Lady, I could scarce keep from crying to look at him ;"
and, upon the faith of this pathetic appeal, Masham made
another attempt to prevail upon her mistress to take his
letter; but again Gertrude rejected it.
“Dear, my Lady! what shall I do? I could no more tell
the Colonel that you would not look at his letter, than I could

put a knife into his heart, my Lady—just the same thing-
Oh! my Lady, Smith says he hasn't been in bed all night,
but has been walking up and down his room, tearing his hair,
my Lady, and taking on so, that he says he's sure he'll lose
his senses, unless something is done, my Lady.". And
Masham ended with a sob ; for Delmour's gaiety, his good
looks, and his liberality, had completely won Masham's
favour. “I'm sure, my Lady, he'll either kill himself or
somebody else, if your Ladyship refuses him, for _” but
at the horrid idea of Delmour and her father engaged in
mortal strife, Gertrude shuddered ; then taking the letter,
she tore it open, and, as she read it, tears again found their
way to her eyes.
“Rash, unjust, misjudging that I am !” thought she ; “he
does not-he will not renounce me--involve me in deeper
ruin by uniting my fate with his ! Ah!--no, no—'tis I who
would involve him in ruin. Yes, I am his in soul and in love ;"
and the hard unnatural tension of mind under which she had
laboured gradually melted into softer feelings.
" But he
loves me. Why-why, then, does he leave me ? ” and again
her doubts and her fears returned ; but then there was so
much delicacy in wishing to have the discovery of her dis-
grace kept secret, until he could have made arrangements
for her, she had no doubt, to soften the blow as much as pos-
sible, that again her sanguine spirit exulted in the truth and
honour of her lover. Had she followed the dictates of her
own feelings, she would instantly have declared herself to her
whole household; but Delmour had besought her not, and,
painful as it was, she thought, for his sake, she would submit
for a while to carry on the deception.
But she would not appear-she would not see the light-
she would pass the time in darkness and in solitude--and her
soul sickened at the very idea of ever again beholding Mrs.
St. Clair and Lewiston. That lady and she had not met
since the disclosure had been made. She had then hastened
to her own apartment, and there, under the influence of guilt,
shame, and passion, had swallowed the remainder of the
laudanum contained in the phial, which, although not
sufficient to make her sleep the sleep of death, had the
effect of throwing her into a convulsive stupor, from which
she could not be roused. Dr. Bruce had taken leave, after
prescribing for Gertrude, whose disorder he soon discovered
was altogether of a mental nature, and, as such, beyond his
skill. Lewiston had, therefore, been left to carouse by him-
self, and to be his own master of the revels. He was a man
of much too coarse a mind to conceive the delicacy of such a
character as Gertrude's, and had always laughed at the idea of

" He
her being such a fool as to betray her own secret; he, there-
fore, remained quite unconscious of the storm which was
ready to burst upon him. Being always on the watch to spy
everything that was going on, he soon came to the knowledge
of Colonel Delmour's intended departure, which he heard of
with great exultation, and thought the field was now his own.
His vulgar curiosity, therefore, led him, as usual, into the
midst of the preparations, and he lounged about the carriage
while it was packing-questioned the servants-examined
and patted the horses-and waited till Delmour appeared,
when he briskly accosted him with,
" So, you're for the road, sir-fine morning—my Lady's
four bays will carry you at a famous rate; you only have
them as far as Barnford, I guess. I had some thoughts of
taking them out myself to-day to give the ladies a ride-but
you're welcome to them, sirquite welcome; the greys will
do for us."
Delmour, with difficulty, refrained from spurning him, but
he repressed his rage, and, as he passed, said in a low voice,
-“Beware how you abuse the indulgence shown you in the
name of the Earl of Rossville, for the sake of one-
could not finish, but, throwing himself into the carriage,
drove off.
There was something so stern and commanding in his eye
and voice, and yet so melancholy and subdued in his manner,
that Lewiston felt alarmed: “The Earl of Rossville, who the
deuce is he?" was his exclamation, as he turned quickly
round, and entered the house. Could anybody have blabbed?
not Mrs. St. Clair, not Gertrude, for it was the interest of
both to conceal it-no, the thing was impossible, but he must
see them; and he immediately sent a message to Mrs. St.
Clair, demanding an interview. But it was answered by her
maid in great agitation, to report that her lady had with the
utmost difficulty been roused from her stupor, and that she
was not herself, her mind was wandering, the Doctor must
be sent for.
“Come, come, I'm for none of your doctors," cried Lewis-
ton, "a confounded, prying, useless, swindling pack. Why,
what did that pompous fellow do for my Lady Countess yes-
terday? felt her pulse, and gave her a glass of water, eh,
and for that he pockets his five guineas—the deuce! Why a
man would be ruined in this country if he were to give way
to women's nonsensical vagaries-- Come, I'm something of
doctor myself, I'll go and see your lady; come along," and
drawing Mrs. Lisle's arm within his, he marched along, and,
in spite of her remonstrances, made his way to Mrs. St. Clair.
But she was, as her maid had represented her, in no con-

dition to answer questions or receive company; there was a
total aberration of intellect, and even Lewiston's presence
made no impression on her. He was so far relieved to find
she was not in the way of endangering the secret, as she
merely muttered to herself a few unintelligible words about
her daughter, then repeated the word daughter to herself
many times over without ceasing.
“She'll come to herself by-and-bye, if you'll let her alone,”
said Lewiston, as he left her with the resolution of next see-
ing his daughter.
CHAPTER LXXII.
GERTRUDE's restored confidence in her lover had given an
impulse to her mind, and she was beginning to recover in
some degree from the dreadful shock she had sustained,
when Lewiston's message, desiring to see her again, deprived
her of the little composure she had regained. Her agitation
was so excessive that Masham, in alarm, summoned Mrs. Ro-
berts, and both agreed that it would be as much as their
lady's life was worth to see anybody that was not particu-
larly agreeable to her at present; and this opinion Mrs.
Roberts delivered in person to Lewiston, who, from some
hints he had thrown out that morning to the servants, was
generally considered as the husband of Mrs. St. Clair, and
consequently the step-father of their lady. This idea was
further confirmed by Colonel Delmour's sudden departure;
and in that capacity he found himself feared and obeyed,
where he would otherwise have been ridiculed and despised.
After swearing a little at Mrs. Roberts's communication, he
said
“Well, Goody, take you care of your lady-feed her well
-give her plenty of good stout meat and drink-none of your
slip-slops-none of
your
meal and water, and poultices--your
gruels and panadas, as you call 'em--by Jove! I'd have a fit
of hysterics myself, if I was to be fed upon such gear. Hark
ye, Goody, if there's such a thing as a nice plump little suck-
ing pig to be had, now's the time-have it killed directly, and
it will be prime for my Lady's dinner-and do you hear, tell
that French fellow of a cook to take care to have the ears
crisp, or, by jingo ! I'll slit his own for him. Stop, Goody,"
as Mrs. Roberts was retiring in silent horror, and he pulled
out his watch, “now, go you to my Lady Countess, and say
that, as I'm a reasonable good-natured man, and always be-
have handsomely when I'm treated handsomely, I shall allow

her twenty-four hours to settle her brains, or her spirits, or
whatever is wrong--and then-remember she must be to a
minute!—I shall expect her to do her duty, and wait upon
me here in this very room, and at this very hour, with a
merry face--as much sooner as she likes-to-day she'll be
welcome, but not a minute after the twenty-four hours—not a
second. Now trot, Goody-don't forget the pig—a three
weeks old will serve my Lady Countess." Mrs. Roberts here
suggested the propriety of medical advice being called, but
she was cut short with="By Jupiter! if any of your doctors
come here, I'll show 'em the way out at the window; there's
no doctor like meat and drink ;” and he went off singing a
vulgar sea song. He then went to order out all the horses,
which he made the servants parade before the house, while
he tried some of them himself, then ordered a chaise-and-
four, and two outriders, as if he had been going a journey ;
but he merely drove up and down the avenue, till, tired of
that, he fell to coits with the servants ; and, in short, com-
pletely illustrated the homely adage of "Set a beggar on
horseback," &c.
Gertrude felt grateful for the respite allowed her, and she
resolved, if possible, to prove her obedience by meeting her
father, and, at the same time, declaring to him what she had
done, even although she trembled to think of all she would
have to encounter. Should he persist in his threat of carry-
ing her off to America, what would become of her ? who
could interpose between a father and his child ? who could
alas ! who would save her? There was no one to whom she
could appeal, for there was no one being with whom she
could claim any kindred, save him to whom she owed her
þeing. Where was Delmour at this trying moment ?—why
had he deserted her? His was the voice to have whispered
peace to her soul—his the arm to have supported and pro-
tected her-but he, her only earthly prop, had left her!
She was roused from the overwhelming conviction of her
own utter helplessness, and the frightful destiny that perhaps
awaited her, by the indefatigable Masham, who in the softest
accents, besought her Ladyship's pardon. But there was
a box of new dresses just arrived for her Ladyship from
Madame Delacour—such beauties! they were fit for a princess !
would her Ladyship be pleased only just to take a look of
them. “See what a déshabille, my Lady, when you please
to rise-how charming it will be !”
Time was when Gertrude's eyes would have sparkled with
pleasure at sight of the beautiful dresses now displayed, but
she turned from them with a shudder, and desired they might
be taken away.

" These were for the Countess of Rossville,” thought she,
with a bitter pang; " and I, impostor, beggar that I am-
shall I ever again dare to appear as such?” She covered
her face with her hands, and groaned in spirit—then, as if
struck with some sudden thought, she called her maid-
“Masham, I would have a dress very different from any
of these. I would have one made of the coarsest of stuffs,
such as-as poor people or charity children wear.” She stop-
ped to wipe away the tears which covered her face, while
Masham stood in speechless amazement.
" It must be very
coarse and quite plain, Masham; and you must set about
getting such an one for me directly."
Sure, my Lady, you don't mean it for yourself?” cried
the amazed Masham, doubting either her own or her Lady's
senses had gone astray. But her Lady repeated her com-
mands in so peremptory a manner, that Masham dared not
expostulate on the subject, but set about obeying the order,
strange and unseemly as it appeared.
Gertrude had inquired for Mrs. St. Clair, and she was told
she was keeping her room; and she asked no further, for the
mention of her name was an effort almost too much for her,
associated as it was in her mind with all the degradation and
ruin she had brought upon her.
Heavily as the time wore away in tears and solitude, the
hour appointed by Lewiston drew near too soon. In the in-
terval he had sent many messages, which, rough and way-
ward as they were, yet showed a species of kindness in their
way ; but his ideas of affection seemed to be of the lowest
description; and the only way in which he testified his, was
through the medium of meat and drink, and many was the
savory mess he dispatched to Gertrude, who turned with
loathing from such coarse demonstrations of paternal re-
gard.
Gertrude clothed herself in the sordid garb which had
been prepared for her ; but her beauty was of too noble and
decided a character to be dependent upon adventitious aid :
the regularity of her features—their touching expression-
the sadness of her dove-like eyes—the paleness of her com-
plexion contrasted with the dark ringlets which fell negli-
gently aronnd her face—the exquisite form of her head and
throat-her distinguished air, even in humility-all these
only appeared the more pre-eminent in the absence of aught
to distract the attention. Averse to having the appearance
of being compelled to meet her father, she repaired to the
saloon rather before the appointed time; she entered, with
downcast eyes and a throbbing heart, unconscious of every-
thing but that she was to meet, for the first time, as her

father, he who had so long been the object of her fear and
her abhorrence. But what was her surprise, when, upon en-
tering, the person who sprung forward to meet and to wel-
come her, and to press her hands in his, was Lyndsay!
“Gertrude, dear Gertrude !” exclaimed he, as he gazed
upon her sad and colourless countenance, “how ill you
look!
Something is wrong." But as the recollection of their last
meeting rushed upon Gertrude's mind, her heart swelled at
the thoughts of her abasement, and the blush of shame rose
almost to her brow.
“I have heard—and it is that report has brought me here
now-that the man whom you have such cause to dread is an
inmate of your house—at least, I guess it is the same-tell
me, Gertrude, is it so ?”
“ You will hear all soon enough,” said Gertrude, in a low
suffocating voice. “Leave me, oh I leave me now !"
“Now, nor never, Gertrude, till I see you safe and happy,”
cried Lyndsay, with emotion. “ Gertrude, I am your cousin
- your friend-your brother if
you
will-Oh! speak to me
then as such-say, what can I do to serve you ?"
But Gertrude only answered with her tears ; then re-
peated
" Leave me-oh! leave me !"
"I will, if there is any one here to protect-to save
you-
At that instant Lewiston entered with the swagger of a
man who wished to show he was quite at home. At sight of
Lyndsay he started, and was evidently disconcerted; but
quickly recovering, he said with his usual assurance,
So, sir, I didn't expect to find you here; I've just been
seeing some young puppies having their ears cropped-sit
down, sir;" then approaching Gertrude, who rose to meet
him, and bowed her head towards him, he took her hand and
shook it. “Well, my Lady Countess, how goes it now ?-
By jingo!" as he surveyed her dress, "you women are al-
ways in extremes. Why, to-day, you're dressed like a charity-
school girl !"
Lyndsay was too much confounded to speak; he had heard,
in a vague way, that a foreigner, whom no one knew anything
about, was living at Rossville with the ladies, and that Co-
lonel Delmour had left it abruptly in consequence of a quar-
rel, with various other particulars, some true, some false,
which had been circulated by the servants, and soon reached
the ears of their masters and mistresses. No sooner had
Lyndsay heard them, than, forgetting all Gertrude's unkind-
ness and ingratitude, he thought only of how he could serve
her, and instantly set off with that purpose.

The gay,
He had only arrived the moment before she appeared, and
the first glance at her had told him a tale of woe and suffer-
ing, that filled him with grief and amazement.
proud, brilliant Countess of Rossville was gone, and there
stood the sad, humble, downcast Gertrude, in passive endu-
rance of, if not actually inviting, familiarity which formerly
her high spirit would have spurned. He looked at her for a
moment in silence, and again the deadly paleness, which had
overspread her face at Lewiston's entrance, was succeeded by
a deep flush, and she raised her hand as if to hide it from his
view.
"Well, sir," said Lewiston, seating himself on a sofa, and
placing Gertrude beside him, while he still held her hand,
to this is not our first meeting—but let that pass- you're my
Lady Countess's cousin, I understand, eh ?—that's enough
sit down."
“You have the advantage of me, sir,” said Lyndsay,
bridling his indignation for Gertrude's sake; “it seems you
know who I am ; who you are, I have yet to learn.”
“ All in good time, sir. Would
you
choose to take a glass
of anything after your ride, or a bit of cold meat? There's a
nice little fellow of a pig that I ordered for my Lady's dinner
yesterday, and she wouldn't look at him it seems, so I've
ordered him for my lunch to-day-as fat as an eel and as
tender as a chicken, I'll answer for him-I saw him scalded
myself."
Agony was painted in every feature of Gertrude's face-
Lyndsay saw it
, and, wishing to end this strange scene, he
said calmly to Lewiston,
“Lady Rossville seems too unwell to take an interest
in such discussions—if you will accompany me to another
“ With all my heart,” cried Lewiston, jumping up.
You
say true, my Lady is a little nervous or so, but she will soon
get over it,” with a wink to her.
Gertrude rose too-her colour changed from white to red,
and from red to white, and she gasped as though she were
suffocating—at length, by a violent effort, she said-
" Go then-but Lyndsay-remember he is my father !"
Lyndsay stood speechless, and for a moment Lewiston was
thrown into consternation, but quickly recovering himself, he
said, “Aye, come along, it shall all be explained," and he took
hold of Lyndsay, and moved impatiently towards the door
but Lyndsay saw only Gertrude standing motionless in shame
and anguish-her head bent beneath her humiliation, and the
cold drops of agony on her brow-he flew towards her.

“Gertrude,” cried he, wildly, “what do you mean? your
father! speak, tell me -
“Well, since the cat's out of the bag,” cried Lewiston,
"you may as well catch it at once ; I'm married to my Lady
Countess's mother, so I am, that's all ; what is there so won-
derful in that?" And again he cast a fierce and threatening
look at Gertrude.
"Is it even so, Gertrude ?" said Lyndsay. “Then, this
can be no home for
you at present-
“ The deuce !" cried Lewiston, fiercely ; “ what right have
you to meddle between a father and his daughter? I am her
step-father, and I have the best right to manage her," and he
would have taken her hand, but Lyndsay placed himself be-
tween them. “ Lady Rossville once chose me for her
guardian ; she will yet acknowledge me as such--will you
not, Gertrude ?-you will trust yourself with me, and I will
place you in safety."
“Oh, he is my father-my own father !" cried Gertrude in
an accent of despair.
Surely, surely!” exclaimed Lewiston hastily; “I am the
husband of her mother-her own father ; you say true-I am
-I am.”
“No-no-no,” cried Gertrude, wildly; "she is not my
mother-she told me all-he is my father," and she almost
shrieked as she uttered it.
“She is mad," cried Lewiston; “I say she is mad."
“'Tis you have made her so, then,” said Lyndsay, pas-
sionately; then turning to Gertrude, “Dearest Gertrude,
try to compose yourself; retire-I will-
“0, he is—he is my father !” repeated Gertrude, convul-
sively.
“ Confound you for an idiot, as you are !” cried Lewiston,
fiercely, and he seemed ready to strike her, had not Lyndsay
stood between them.
"Save mel oh! save me from him!” cried Gertrude, as
she clung to Lyndsay's arm; " but he is-
“I will, dearest Gertrude-do not be afraid ;" then turning
to Lewiston he said, in a voice of forced calmness, but with
an air of the most resolute determination, “You are mis-
taken, if you suppose, that, as the husband of Mrs. St. Clair,
you have acquired any lawful authority over this lady. If
you claim it by any other tie, you must first bring forward
your evidence, and have it recognised, before it can be ac-
knowledged ; in the meantime, Lady Rossville is under my
protection; I am her guardian, and from her own lips only
will I listen to what has passed. You will do well, then, to

leave this room without altercation, otherwise it may be un-
pleasant for you."
“Oh! no, no !” cried Gertrude, in an agony of terror ;
“he is my father-do not use him ill.”
“Don't you hear her acknowledge my authority ?” cried
Lewiston; " and what title have you, then, to interfere-you
confounded meddling blockhead "
" Gertrude, will you go into the next room for a few
minutes ?” said Lyndsay, and he would have led her to the
door.
" Ay, dom-go along," cried Lewiston; women are always
better out of the way when there's business on hand.”
“I will not leave you,” said Gertrude, as, pale and trem-
bling, she still held by Lyndsay.
“But I order you to-
"Speak but another syllable to this lady," interrupted
Lyndsay, on the point of losing all self-command, “and I
will instantly call the servants to force you from her pre-
sence.”
“ Coward !” cried Lewiston, furiously.
The blood rushed to Lyndsay's brow.
Edward, dear Edward !” cried Gertrude, “ do not, he is
my father.”
" I know you only as Lady Rossville, and as such I will
speak to you alone,” said Lyndsay. He rang the bell, and
when the servant answered it, desired him, in a calm but firm
manner, to show that gentleman to the library; then waving
his hand to Lewiston, in a way that showed he would be
obeyed, he said, “I will join you there in half an hour ;"
and Lewiston, casting a threatening look at Gertrude, and
muttering imprecations to himself, was thus compelled to
withdraw.
CHAPTER LXXIII.
But it was with difficulty Gertrude could be brought to re-
peat to Lyndsay all that she had already recapitulated to
Delmour. She had then been under an excitement of mind,
to which everything had given way; she had felt as though
she were then about to cast the die for life or death, and, in
the energy of desperation, she had told all with the eloquence
of feelings which mocked control. But here there was no
such stimulus, and she shrank from repeating the hateful and
ignominious detail of her disgrace. It was throwing herself
too much upon the sympathy and the commiseration of one

on whom she had no claim-one whom, in the heyday of her
prosperity, she had treated with coldness and ingratitude
and she leant her burning brow on her hand, and strove to
steel herself against the kind and affectionate entreaties
Lyndsay used to gain her confidence. At length, he gathered
from her such particulars as enabled him to trace out the
whole of the dark transaction which had involved her in
ruin. For a time his emotion kept him silent, while Ger-
trude sat with her elbows resting on a table, and her face
buried in her hands. But Lyndsay was ever more intent on
allaying the afflictions of others, than in indulging his own
feelings; and he soon mastered his own agitation, that he
might be the better able to calm Gertrude's; but his voice
faltered as he spoke.
“Dearest Gertrude,” said he, “ I know it will be in vain to
talk of comfort to you in the first anguish of your mind; but
-ahl Gertrude, could you discern the hand that has thus
smitten you--could you look up to Heaven, and say, it is my
Father's will.”
“I do,” cried Gertrude, in a low, suffocating voice. But,
alas ! the feeling burnt feebly in her breast. “And anything
but this I could have borne ; but disgrace-infamy___” her
emotion choked her utterance.
“No, Gertrude, you are unjust to yourself, unmindful of
God, if you attach such ideas of personal degradation to what
has befallen you. 'Tis true you have no longer a title-a
vain, empty title-or wealth to spend perhaps to satiety; but
how much nobler a being are you now, thus dignified by
voluntary self-abasement, and rich in all the native gifts of
your Creator, than ever you were, or would have been, as the
mere favoured child of this world !-Ah! Gertrude, dear
Gertrude, could you but view yourself with my eyes !"
“ To have been an impostor—an usurper !” exclaimed she.
“ How perverse sorrow has made you, Gertrude! You
are neither; you have been the victim of imposture, but
your own name is pure and spotless—it is more--to those who
can appreciate virtue it will carry a nobler sound along with
it than any that heraldry could have bestowed. How poor is
the boast of ancestry, compared with that lofty sense of
honour, which has made you trample under foot all those
allurements, to which your soul still cleaves even in renounc-
ing! This is greatness !"
* Who but you will judge me thus ?”
“ All who love virtue—all who love you, Gertrude
Love me!” repeated she, relapsing into an agony of
grief, “oh! who could love me, base, vile, abject as I
am?"

335
« Gertrude !" cried Lyndsay, in emotion almost equal to
her own,“ do you, indeed, ask who could love you ?"
But Gertrude was silent, for her thoughts were all of Del-
mour. Lyndsay's agitation increased.
“You ask me who could love you, Gertrude ? he who has
once loved you truly will love you still—will love you more
than ever-İ-" he stopped, then took two or three turns
about the room in great disorder, while Gertrude, absorbed
in grief, and thinking only of his words as applied to her
lover, was little aware of what was passing in Lyndsay's
generous heart. In a few minutes he regained his usual
calmness, and approaching her, took her hand and said,
“Gertrude, you are unable to stand this storm which has
come upon you; you must retire to your own apartment, and
allow me to act for you ; I promise you that nothing shall
provoke me to violence ; I promise you that I will bear every-
thing."
“Oh! you have borne too much already for me," cried
Gertrude, with a burst of weeping. “My best, my only
friend," added she in a voice choked with emotion.
“ You will then look upon me as your friend—as your
guardian-as your brother-will you not, Gertrude ? such
and all will I be to you, so help me God !”
Gertrude could not speak, but she pressed the hand which
still held hers, in grateful acknowledgment, and relying on
Lyndsay's promise, as she knew she well might, she, at last,
consented that he should see her father alone, and that she
should await the result of the conference.
After seeing her mind somewhat strengthened, and her
spirits more composed, Lyndsay then repaired to the library,
where he found Lewiston vainly attempting to hide his rage,
by affecting to busy himself in coolly turning over the books,
while it was evident he was only exercising his fury upon
them. He took no notice of Lyndsay's entrance, but went
on tossing over the leaves of a splendid folio, in a manner
enough to have made a bibliopolist faint; then began to
whistle with an air of unconcern, which, however, did not sit
very easily upon him.
Lyndsay waited a few minutes in silence, then said-
“I have been hearing a strange tale, sir, from one-
“ Have you so, sir ?" rudely interrupted Lewiston, looking
at an engraving in the book, as if deeply interested in it;
“ have you so—and what then?”
" Then I would have your account, sir, of the same story."
“ You would ? then I must trouble you, sir, to let me know
what your story is in the first place, that we may understand
each other, sir."

THE INHERITANCE.
Lyndsay repeated what Gertrude had communicated to
him, and added-
“It is, therefore, in vain to attempt to carry on any further
concealment; the truth must be proclaimed; but for the
sake of one whom hitherto I have only known as a dearly-
loved relative, I would fain have it softened, as-
“ Confound her for an idiot!" exclaimed Lewiston furiously,
as he hurled the book from him with violence, and pushed
over an inkstand ; then kicked back his chair, and drove
everything aside, while he took two or three strides across
the room, biting his thumb in the manner of one who must
have something, no matter what, on which to wreak his pas-
sion.
Lyndsay was too judicious to interrupt him; disgusting as
the spectacle of uncontrolled passion was, for Gertrude's sake
he submitted to it in silence. At length Lewiston stopped,
and said abruptly-
“ Has the fool blabbed to anybody else, or are you her only
father confessor ?"
“ I cannot tell whether the disclosure has been made known
to any one else," said Lyndsay, for Delmour's name had not
been mentioned between them; “but it can signify little,
since it must soon be made public."
"Well, she deserves to suffer for her confounded folly ;
but you seem to have a liking for the girl, fool as she is ?"
then, as if communing with himself, “ She is handsome, very
handsome, I've seen nothing like her; she'll make a figure in
New Jersey; she'll go well off there."
Lyndsay tried to be calm, even at the idea of the beautiful
high-souled Gertrude taken to America to be bartered, sold,
by such a savage, and said, “Even if you are the person you
give out, it does not necessarily follow, that this unfortunate
lady must be compelled to reside with you."
Why what's to become of her?”
“ It is unnecessary to discuss that question at present; but
be assured, she possesses friends, whose influence and fortune,
neither of them inconsiderable, will be devoted to her
service."
“That is to say, you would marry her such as she is ?
Well, as you seem to have a liking for her, I'll tell you what,
if the thing has gone no farther, and I don't think it has, or
t'other spark wouldn't have set off as he did ; why, since
you're fond of her, I'll give my consent that you should have
her, upon condition that all's to be kept snug ; she'll come to
her senses by-and-bye, and be sorry that she's played the
fool this way. And more than that, if you'll agree to settle
handsomely upon me, I'll engage to go back to my own

manner-
country, which is the best after all; and, since we don't put
up together, let us keep on different sides of the Atlantic.
What do you say to that, sir ?"
“I say you are a villain," burst from Lyndsay's lips; "and
I must have the most clear undeniable evidence that you are
the person you profess to be, before I will give credit to it; I
do not believe you are the father of Gertrude,”—and he
fixed his eyes upon him, as though he would have searched
his very soul.
The blood rushed to Lewiston's face, and for some minutes
he was silent, then recovering himselí, he said, in his usual
I'm all you'll have for him though, sir, whether you be-
lieve it or not; I am Jacob Ruxton Lewiston of Perth-
Amboy, New Jersey; and that you'll find, if you'll be so
good as step over the way and inquire.”
" That may be ; but there may have been more Jacob
Ruxton Lewistons than one.”
“Why, haven't I got my wife's letter here?” taking out a
pocket-book, and holding it up with triumph ; " haven't I
the testimony of the priest who witnessed it? and he is still
alive too, and forthcoming if wanted, and who swore to her
never to give it into any hand but her husband's? And isn't
there Mrs. St. Clair ready to swear to me when she comes to
herself? what the plague would you have, sir ?”
"All that is insufficient-
Perhaps you judge by my looks; I've wore well, I grant
you; but I'm eight-and-thirty for all that-married at nine-
teen—the more fool-
“Nothing you can now say will have the slightest effect in
removing my doubts,” said Lyndsay.
“Faith, I care very little about it,” said Lewiston, with
affected coolness; you may keep your doubts, and welcome,
for me."
“That I shall certainly do, till I have obtained better evi-
dence than your own. I will send a person, on whose fidelity
and prudence I can perfectly rely, to the place from whence
you say you came, to procure proofs of your identity; when
he returns with these you may then claim your daughter, but
not till then. I am her guardian, and will be answerable for
her safety-
Here Lewiston burst out in a strain of the coarsest invec-
tive and imprecations; but Lyndsay remained calm and reso-
lute, and only said-
“In these circumstances, you must be aware this can be
no residence for you. You will do well, therefore, to prepare
to leave it as soon as you can make your arrangements; and,

if the means are wanting, I am ready to furnish you with
what is necessary."
He then left the room, and hastened to Gertrude, who was
waiting him in an agony of apprehension.
CIIAPTER LXXIV.
It was with caution Lyndsay communicated to Gertrude the
suspicions which he entertained; but, to one of her sanguine
spirit, the slightest surmise was sufficient to kindle hope in
her breast. It was certain she was no longer Countess of
Rossville ; but not to be the daughter of this man, not to
loathe and shudder at him to whom she owed her being, even
this seemed almost happiness. But then, as she thought of
the difficulty of procuring evidence from so distant a quarter
of the world, her spirit sank, and she exclaimed—“But how
impossible for me to obtain information, and how vague and
unsatisfactory must it be !”
“ Trust that to me, dear Gertrude," said Lyndsay, “I will
send, by the first ship, a person who will thoroughly investi-
gate into this man's history, and on whose testimony you may
safely rely. I would go myself if that would be more satis-
factory to you, and if I saw you in a place of safety."
"Oh, Lyndsay !" cried Gertrude, with a burst of tears
which, for a moment, choked her utterance; then passion-
ately exclaimed——“You protect and save me, while he .!”
she uttered a sob, as though her heart had broke, then re-
mained silent.
Blinded as Gertrude was by romantic passion, she could
not but be struck with the contrast between her lover's con-
duct and that of Lyndsay; and the conviction rushed upon
her heart with a bitterness which, for a time, absorbed every
other consideration. With emotion scarcely less than her
own, Lyndsay now inquired whether she had divulged the
secret to any one else. Gertrude struggled for a few moments
to regain her composure, then said, "Yes, to one whom it
more nearly concerned than any other; and now I wait but
to hear from him to make known my disgrace to the whole
world.”
“How false, how worldly are your notions of disgrace,
dear Gertrude!” said Lyndsay. “ But I will not stop to
combat them now; tell me what you wish to have done—what
are your plans?”
“ It is Colonel Delmour's wish that I should remain

-or-
here until I hear from him,” said Gertrude, in a faltering
voice.
“ Be it so, then,” said Lyndsay, with emotion; “but re-
member, Gertrude, you have a home, if you will deign to
accept of it; my house is yours to command. My aunt, Mrs.
Lyndsay, whom you have heard me mention, is now in Scot-
land, and will reside there with you. You would love her if
you knew her, for she is good and gentle, and knows what
suffering is : for myself, I shall possibly go abroad for awhile
-but, in short, I can be at no loss—so promise, that
if-
“No, no, I never will be a pensioner on your bounty,"
cried Gertrude in violent agitation—“I will work-beg-Oh!
Lyndsay, how you wring my heart !” and she leaned her
head on a table and wept bitterly.
Forgive me, dearest Gertrude, if I have hurt you—God
knows it was far from my thoughts ! and now,
let me recom-
mend to you to retire to your own apartment--you will be safe
from intrusion-and leave everything to me.
Rest assured
there shall no violence be used-he shall be treated as your
father, though not recognised as such."
“But ought I not to see him once more ? and-oh! Lynd-
say—if I should have turned my father from the house !
Oh, no–I cannot. Suffer him to remain-he is—nay, must be
-my father-he could not have imposed upon her!"
“At such a distance of time it is quite possible he might-
but, dear Gertrude, confide in me, I will do nothing harshly;
but you cannot remain under the same roof-it will
kill you-
he shall go to my house—he shall be well treated—indeed he
shall.” And Gertrude, calmed by these assurances, at length
consented to shut herself up in her own apartment, and even
to refuse to see Lewiston if he should attempt it. Lyndsay's
next business was to visit Mrs. St. Clair, in hopes of eluci-
dating something from her; but he was shocked at the situa-
tion in which he found her, and immediately sent off for me-
dical assistance, and also to Mr. and Miss Black, requesting
them to come to Rossville as soon as possible. He had
scarcely done all this when Lewiston entered the room where
he was with a mingled air of confusion and effrontery.
“So, sir, you're going to raise the country, it seems—two
men on horseback galloping away there as if the deuce were
in them. What's the meaning of all this? I must see my
daughter," added he, abruptly.
" When you have established your claim to that title you
shall see her; till then, I have already told you I act as her
guardian, and, as such, I will not consent to your meeting;

if
you had the feelings of a parent you would see the pro-
priety of this."
Feelings !” exclaimed Lewiston; “by Jovel my feelings
have been prettily treated since I came amongst you—may
I
be flayed if ever I met with such usage. Feelings, by jingo!
I say my feelings have been confoundedly ill-used, and I feel
it too ;” and he walked up and down in great discomposure.
“She whom you call your daughter is not unmindful of
your feelings,” said Lyndsay; “ although, by my advice, she
declines a meeting, which could serve no purpose but to agi-
tate and distress her ; but she is very desirous that you
should be treated with consideration, that you should have
every comfort and indulgence which you may require, and I
shall therefore make a point of seeing you properly accom-
modated."
“What does she mean by all this palaver? does she mean
by comfort and indulgences, and so forth, a round sum of
money?
If she does I comprehend that — give me mo-
ney, and faith I'll soon find comforts and indulgences for
myself."
“ You must be conscious, that, as your daughter, she can
have nothing to bestow," said Lyndsay ; “but I possess the
means; and when assured that you have told me the truth,
one way or other, for the truth is all I require from you,
we shall then perhaps be able to come to an agreement."
Lewiston remained thoughtful for a few minutes, then
said, “ Has the goose quacked to any but yourself? I want
to know."
“Colonel Delmour has been made acquainted with all the
particulars, and is gone to consult with his brother, now Earl
of Rossville, as to what is to be done. Be assured, at their
hands you will meet with little indulgence."
Here Lewiston broke out into an execration against Del-
mour, and against Gertrude, both of whom he denounced in
the bitterest terms, then suddenly changing his tone, he said,
“It will cost you something, I can tell you, to send to New
Jersey, that it will—a few dollars, I can tell you."
“I have already told you I am ready to pay a good price
for the knowledge of the truth, be it what it may," said
Lyndsay.
"What! even supposing--only supposing you know—that
I were not the girl's father ?"
Perhaps I should be inclined to pay more for that disco-
very than for any other,” said Lyndsay, trying to hide his
emotion; “ but I again repeat, it is the truth, and the truth
only, I require, and that, sooner or later, I am sure of ar-

riving at—a few months will bring me the knowledge of
that.
“ I tell
you
it will cost you money."
66 And I have told you I am ready to pay it.”
“Why, how much do you reckon upon ? what lengths
are you ready to go-eh?”
“I am willing to go any lengths to detect fraud and vil-
lainy, but not to reward it; I am perhaps wrong in offering to
come to any compromise with you, but regard for the peace
of one who is suffering from your villainy induces me-
“Will you give a thousand pound?” interrupted Lewiston
abruptly.
No ; I will give more if necessary to discover the truth,
but I will not reward falsehood in the same measure.”
“ Confound your distinctions! Will you give five hun-
dred ? By jingo! I won't bate a halfpenny."
Upon condition that you swear solemnly to tell the whole
truth,” said Lyndsay, "I will do more for you than I am per-
haps justified in doing—I will pay your expenses from America
back to it, and I will settle an annuity upon you of fifty
pounds per annum upon condition that you give up that letter
and never set foot in Britain again.”
“I'd rather have a good round sum at once I want
" It is in vain to say more on the subject,” said Lyndsay ;
- if you wish to have an hour to reflect upon it you may,
but that must be all. I shall immediately set about the neces-
sary steps to be taken in this affair, and it is likely you will
repent having refused my offer when too late."
He was moving away when Lewiston caught his arm.
Well, will you put in black and white what you have
agreed to give, and—and then--we shall see ?”
Lyndsay immediately took up a pen and wrote his offer.
Lewiston took it-looked at it-hemmed-coloured—and be-
came confused-at last, plucking up effrontery, he said, -
“Well, then, I am not the girl's father, and that's as true
as that God made me.”
At this acknowledgment Lyndsay's heart thrilled with
rapture, and he could scarcely refrain from flying to Ger-
trude with the joyful tidings. Lewiston went on, “But I am
of the same blood--the only one, by-the-bye, remaining-
and the same name--I was her father's cousin, and when the
old dotard of a priest came to Perth-Amboy, and inquired for
Jacob Ruxton Lewiston, to be sure, he found me—'twas by
way of humbug, at first, that I passed myself off for the
man who had been drowned nearly twenty years before ;
but when I found what his business was—but that's enough
I hate long stories--and so, as soon as you can let me have

this on a proper bit of parchment,” pointing to the paper
Lyndsay had given him, " then I'll wish you a good afternoon."
“ But how came you to impose yourself so easily upon
Mrs. St. Clair ?" inquired Lyndsay, anxious, for Gertrude's
sake, to ascertain everything.
6. She had seen the person you
represented ?"
" She had so, but it was near twenty years ago, and there
was a family likeness, it seems ; besides, I had the letter to
shut her mouth, and since I was master of her sccret it signi-
fied little to her whether I were the girl's father or not, I had
got the upper hand of her anyhow."
Having got all the information that was wanted, Lyndsay
was now only desirous of being rid of so worthless an inmate,
and, after admonishing him upon the iniquity of his ways, he
gave him a letter to his agent, directing the money to be
paid, and the bond to be made out for his annuity, then only
waited to see him fairly out of the house before he communi-
cated to Gertrude the happy result.
CHAPTER LXXV.
FOR a time Gertrude felt as though she were again restored
to all she had lost, in her joy at finding she was not the
daughter of the man whom her very soul abhorred; and, at
the moment, all other evils seemed light compared to that she
had just escaped.
She could not find words to thank Lyndsay for his gene-
rous interference (though that was only known to her in
part); but her looks her tears—her broken exclamations,
spoke more forcibly the feelings of her heart. The first flush
of joy over, many a bitter thought arose—she was still the
fallen, degraded, dependent being, without a home-without
a friend save one-he to whom she owed all—and Delmour!
-but on Delmour she would not think she would wait in
all the unnatural calmness of patience, which knew not re-
signation, till she heard from him—and then !—and her heart
heaved in agony as she thought what might then be the
result.
Lyndsay seemed to guess something of what was passing
in her mind, for he said, with some emotion,-
“Those who, like yourself, have been imposed upon in this
fraud-ought not they also to be undeceived ?—shall I per-
form that duty for you?—shall I write -” he stopped ; but
Gertrude knew to whom he alluded, and, for a moment, she

wished that Delmour were indeed apprized of the discovery
which had been made, that she was not the daughter of the
horrid Lewiston—but in another instant she rejected the idea.
“No," thought she, “I will not seem to court his notice-
as heiress of Rossville I gloried in avowing my preference for
him ; but as the poor homeless Gertrude, 'tis he must now
seek me-my heart may break, but it will not bend-I will
wait, I will be to him all or nothing !" But she almost
gasped as she repeated to Lyndsay—“I will wait-" then,
after a pause, she added, with a deep blush, “but do you
what you think right for me.
And Lyndsay's generous disinterested spirit, guided upon
every occasion by that heavenly principle, " Do unto others
even as you would that others should do unto you," prompted
him to write and acquaint Delmour with the truth. As the
daughter of Lewiston, he was certain he never would have
stooped to an alliance with Gertrude ; but whether, as she
was now situated, he would still fulfil his engagement, was a
doubtful question. At any rate, it was due to him to be un-
deceived ; and though he comprehended and approved of the
delicacy which kept Gertrude silent, he deemed it but the
more incumbent on him to declare the truth. He therefore
wrote a simple and brief statement of what had passed,
without noticing or alluding to anything else, and having dis-
patched his letter, he awaited the answer in an agitation of
mind little inferior to Gertrude's.
Meanwhile, Dr. Bruce and Mr. and Miss Black had suc-
cessively arrived, and it was Lyndsay's painful task to make
the two latter acquainted with the guilty transaction, which
he did in the gentlest and most delicate manner. But, how-
ever desirous he was of sparing their feelings, it was impos-
sible to soften the disgraceful fact, which fell upon them like
a thunderbolt, and affected them each according to the dif-
ference of their mind and feelings. When the first shock
had been surmounted, it was settled that Miss Black should
remain at Rossville for the present in attendance upon Mrs.
St. Clair, whose situation was such as to disarm every hostile
feeling, even could such have found harbour in her sister's
breast. It was in sorrow, not in anger, that she acknowledged
the disgrace which had fallen upon them; and Lyndsay
hoped, that her soft unupbraiding spirit might tend to calm
Gertrude's wilder grief; but Gertrude refused to see her.
“Do not,” said she to Lyndsay, with an agitation that
shook her whole frame,-“ do not ask me to see any one at
present, never ask me to see the sister of _” she stopped
shuddering.
“But you forgive her, Gertrude?” said Lyndsay.

Gertrude was silent for some moments, then exclaimed
with a burst of emotion, -
“Oh! it is dreadful to have been thus striving against
nature, striving to love as my mother her who was my bit-
terest enemy. She has broken bands which God himself had
knit-my mother, and I knew her not as such! gentle and
uncomplaining, I treated her as my servant. Oh! may God
forgive me, but do not ask me to forgive her !”
" Ah! Gertrude, it was not thus we were taught to pray
by Him who forgave us !"
But Gertrude only wept in bitterness of heart.
“Dear Gertrudel you have been heroic-will you not be
forgiving? Do not let me think you find it easier to be great
than to be good.”
I would do much,” said Gertrude, in increasing
emotion—“I would do even this, if I could—but I cannot-
do not, then-do not name her to me,” cried she passionately,
while she pressed her hands her bosom, as if to still the
tumult of her soul_“She it is who has made me the lost,
degraded, wretched being that I am, and ever must remain ;'
-and again her tears burst forth.

CHAPTER LXXVI.
GERTRUDE now experienced the agony of suspense in all its
intensity. Restless and unquiet she walked about her own
apartment, or, starting at every sound, stopped to listen with
suspended breath-then pressed her throbbing heart, as
though she could have stilled its tumults by the touch of her
hand.
• Why do I submit to this—why do I endure it?" inquired
she of herself, as she bent her burning brow in shame at the
tears that had fallen in showers on her lover's picture, on
which she had been gazing—"He left me, and at what a time !
-No, I will not wait to be rejected-cast off like something
vile- I will go if it were to beg;” and for a moment she
formed the desperate resolution of leaving Rossville secretly
-of flying she knew not, cared not where--she would find
some spot on which to lay her aching head till death should
close her eyes. But then the madness of the scheme struck
her-she felt she could not mingle with the vulgar throng :-
young, distinguished, and delicately bred, where could she
find a shelter ? Lyndsay, 'tis true, had offered her a home
- but her spirit already bowed beneath the load of gratitude

she owed to him. Then, with that ebb and flow of mind
which is ever the effect of powerful excitement, returned her
faith in Delmour-yes-it was-it must be his love for her
which had hurried him from her_his was not that selfish
passion—he had said so a thousand times, which would
plunge the object he loved in all the wretchedness of poverty,
and she knew that he was poor—that he was even in debt-
that it was impossible he could support her as he would have
his wife appear; but he had gone to prevail upon his brother
to provide for them, and he would come-Oh yes ! he would
come and claim her as his own!”
It was thus Gertrude communed with herself-her mind
either a prey to despair, or busied in vain fantastic dreams,
which, even if they were destined to be realised, it was idle-
ness to indulge. Her agitation was not lessened when, on
the third morning after her lover's departure, intelligence
arrived of the death of Mr. Delmour.
Gertrude was not so callous to right feeling as not to hear
of this event with mingled grief and awe; and the moral was
too striking not to fall with conviction on her heart. With
tears she acknowledged the vanity—the emptiness of worldly
distinction ; and kneeling, prayed—for the moment fervently
-devoutly prayed in all the humiliation of a contrite spirit,
and an awakened heart.
Again Gertrude's heart bounded, as she thought her lover
was now Earl of Rossville—able and could she doubt ?
willing to restore her to all she had lost. She would have
renounced all for him-she had stood the test, and a thousand,
aye, ten thousand times had he wished that it were in his
power to prove to her the disinterestedness of his love in
return.
There was no longer room for uncertainty. Although he
might not choose to involve her in the hardships and pri-
vations of poverty, yet how would he exult in raising her to
the height from which she descended! And again gay and
vain-glorious visions began to swim before those eyes still
wet with tears of penitence for former follies.
Suspense was now changed into impatience scarcely less
supportable, as she counted the days and hours which must
elapse before she could receive the assurance of her lover's
faith ; but at length the time came when she might bear from
him, but no letter was there. Another—and another-and
another day passed on, every instant of which was as an age
of agony to Gertrude's throbbing soul, as again it was over-
whelmed with a sea of doubts, and again the sickness of hope
deferred crept like poison through her veins. But who can
count the beatings of the lonely heart? Once more she had

watched from her window the arrival of the post; again she
had held her breath to listen for the footstep that was to bring
her the letter on which her existence seemed to depend; but
a long and dreary pause followed. At length it was broken
by a message from Lyndsay, requesting to see her.
Something is wrong !" thought she; "he is dead, or-
she could not finish the sentence, even in imagination, but
pale, trembling, gasping for breath, she repaired to the
library, where she was told he awaited her.
Her own agitation was too great to permit her to notice
Lyndsay's, as he advanced to meet her, and would have
spoken, but the words died on his lips. Then Gertrude
looked on him, but it was not grief that was depicted in his
countenance ; yet neither was it joy, but a strange mingled
expression agitated his usually serene features, which she, in
vain, strove to construe. He took her hand, but it was in a
manner more respectful, and an air more embarrassed, than
he was wont to testify towards her, with whom he had
hitherto been on the very footing of a friend.
“You have heard—you have heard, Lyndsay,” cried
Gertrude—but she could say no more.
“I have,” said Lyndsay, with an emotion he vainly tried
to master. “Gertrude-dearest Gertrude,"-he turned from
her for a moment, and paced the chamber in disorder, while
Gertrude, bereft of all motion, stood pale and speechless.
Suddenly he approached her, and putting a letter into her
hands, he held them locked in his, while he said, in a voice
choked with agitation --
Gertrude, I cannot now say what I feel, but if at this
time you can think of me at all, think of me as your truest,
your firmest friend—as one who shares your every feeling:
He then quitted the apartment, but Gertrude was scarcely
conscious he had spoken, for a glance of her eye had told her
the letter was from Delmour. It was an opened one, and
addressed to Lyndsay. With desperate courage she unfolded
it-she began to read it with a beating heart and a trembling
hand—but as she went on, every nerve and fibre felt as
though they were hardening into stone. It was as follows :-
" DEAR LYNDSAY,
“The melancholy intelligence of my
lamented
brother's death would reach you some days ago—that, toge-
ther with the heart-rending scene I went through at Rossville,
was almost too much for me, and must be my excuse for
having so long delayed acknowledging your letter. Perhaps
another motive, still more powerful, has also influenced me,
which I know I need not hesitate to avow to you. It is the

earnest heart-felt desire I have to do every justice to one,
who, though still dearer to me than life, and whom it is dis-
traction to me even to think of relinquishing-yet, at present
I fear I may not venture to call mine-yet mine I know she
is, and ever will be in heart, as Heaven knows how wholly I
am hers! But circumstanced as we both are, it would be
folly, madness—in short, you must be aware of the difficulties
with which I have to contend. You know, and I do not
hesitate to acknowledge, that I consider birth as the most
important of all distinctions, and I believe I am not singular
in my sentiments upon this subject; at least, I know my
uncle, the Duke (whom I ventured to sound upon this matter),
is still more decided in his opinion, and as he is now in a very
declining state, and has much in his own power, I own I am
unwilling to come to extremities with him at present. You
are aware that the Rossville property, considerable as it is,
did not prove sufficient, during the last year, to support the
dignity of the family, and that considerable debts have, in
consequence, been incurred. I am far from intending to
convey the most distant insinuation against the dear object
of my affections, for, if any blame was imputable, it would be,
perhaps, more justly due to me; but she only lived as her
rank demanded, and as I should choose my wife to do ; and I
merely mention this, to prove to you that I am at present far
from independent as my own debts (that to yourself amongst
others, dear Lyndsay) are of some magnitude, and both
together leave me little choice as to what, in common pru-
dence, I am called upon to do. Distressing as it is, I con-
sider myself called upon for the present to relinquish those
hopes which have so long formed the happiness of my life,
and which I will still cherish even in spite of fate. A time
may, and I trust will yet come, when no such heart-rending
alternative will be necessary. Meanwhile, it is my most
anxious wish that everything should be done that can pos-
sibly contribute to the peace and comfort of my adored Ger-
trude. I entreat you will therefore prevail upon her to remain
at Rossville. It is my intention to go abroad for a year or
two, and it will materially contribute to my tranquillity to
know that she is still mistress there, and in possession of all
those enjoyments which I know she prizes so much. I must
therefore entreat your good offices to have everything
arranged on this point. Let her choose whom she will to
reside with her, or, should she persist in choosing another
residence, let everything be arranged in the most liberal
I inclose you an order upon Coutts, that you may
draw on my account for whatever is requisite. Let nothing
be wanting that can, in any degree, tend to embellish an
manner.

existence which, alas ! from henceforth, like my own, I fear
will be but a painful one. Dear Lyndsay, to your hands I
commit my treasure-on your friendship I place the utmost
reliance. Í know her affections are mine-wholly mine ; and
I--but who that has loved Gertrude could ever love
another? I will endeavour to write to her myself when my
nerves have regained some firmness; but at present you may
judge of the state of my mind from this distracted scrawi.
Write to me, I entreat of you, dear Lyndsay-tell me how
my dearest love bears herself—write by return of post-tell
me all—everything; and believe me your affectionate
“ ROSSVILLE."
“P.S. -The law people are taking the necessary steps to
have my rights recognised. Contrive to save my poor Ger-
trude's feelings as much as possible on this occasion.”
CHAPTER LXXVII.
Such was the letter, and when Gertrude ended it, she cast
one look of anguish to heaven, as she murmured,
“For him, oh, my God! I would have abandoned all !
Thou knowest that I would !"
She could not have found a name for the wretchedness
which wrung her heart, but yet with a mien outwardly calm,
save for her burning cheek and quivering lip, she passed to
the adjoining room where Lyndsay was waiting, with the
most intense anxiety, the effect which this communication
would produce. As Gertrude returned the letter, she merely
bent her head to him ; but he saw that her eyes were tear-
less, and her air was even loftier than it was wont. She
moved on towards a door, at the opposite end of the room,
which communicated with her own suite of apartments, and
Lyndsay made no attempt to detain her; but when her hand
was upon the lock, she turned round, and approaching him,
took his hand, and pressed it between hers, –
“My dear-my only friend,” said she, “may God bless
“Why do you say so now, dearest Gertrude ?” cried
Lyndsay, fearing, he knew not what, from the unnatural
calmness of her manner.
“ Because, because I feel it,” said Gertrude with a sigh, as
though her heart had broke.
“ And I-may I too say all I feel for you?” said Lyndsay,
with emotion.
you !"

349
“No; why should you feel for me? I am well, quite
well," said Gertrude, with the same sort of wild calmness,
“ but I will never forget your kindness to me!"
A tear gleamed in her eye as she turned away. Lyndsay
made an effort to detain her, as he exclaimed, " Speak, then;
tell me what you would have me do to serve you—to save
you if I can from-
Gertrude gently disengaged herself from him, while she
said in a firm voice, “I will not remain here; but I have
arrangements to make before I go :-do not seek to detain
me !"
"
“Where will you go, dearest Gertrude ?-my house is
yours, and my aunt-
“I will not go to your house, Edward,” said Gertrude, and
her voice began to falter: then, making an effort to regain her
composure, she quickly added, “I know not yet where I
shall go; I must have time; I have arrangements to make-
but I cannot breathe here--" and she gasped as she spoke:
then waving her hand to Lyndsay, she hastily entered her
own apartment.
Still Gertrude's energy did not forsake her, as she set
about her preparations; but she mistook for fortitude what in
reality was only fever of mind, and it was under that false
excitement that she acted. She was alive but to one feeling
-she had been deserted by him for whom she would have
sacrificed the world itself-he whom she loved sufficiently
even to have renounced-he whom every hallowed obliga-
tion, every principle of honour, every feeling of tenderness,
had bound to her by ties she had considered as indissoluble ;
he had dared to insult her, by supposing she would choose to
be indebted to his bounty for her support; he deemed her
unworthy of being his wife, and he would have her submit
to become his pensioner !—to live upon his alms !—to be
clothed and fed by him !- to drag out a life of dependence
amid those very scenes which had witnessed her in the full
meridian of her prosperity! She could not-she would not
consider what she was to do-whither she was to go: it mat-
tered not what became of her were she but away from Ross-
ville ; she would work, beg, starve, but she would not sink
into a base stipendiary.
But, alas! Gertrude knew nothing of life and its ways,
when she reasoned thus—she knew nothing of those various
manners and degrees in which every human being, even
those possessed of the loftiest feelings of independence, are
bound more or less to one another. She only panted to
escape from the degradation she felt she was enduring, and
every other idea was absorbed in that single one.

THE INHERITANCE.
But when her arrangements were completed, then the
dreadful sense of her own utter loneliness came upon her,
and she pressed her throbbing temples in agony, as she leant
her head upon her hand, and vainly strove to think of whither
and to whom she would go. But " the world seem'd all be-
fore her where to choose," for she had no claim upon any
one being in it; and who would claim her_abject—degraded
-fallen as she was ?-No one, but the generous noble-
minded Lyndsay, and he was the last person she would have
recourse to she could not bear that he should look upon her
in her humiliation-he knew that she had been rejected-for-
saken-he had seen that heart which had been so fondly
sought, so proudly won, now cast back upon her as a thing of
naught!
She was roused from this agony of thought by the entrance
of her maid, to announce that Mr. Ramsay was in the saloon,
and wished to see her.
“I will not see him I will not see any one that and,
again, the borror which she felt for all connected with the
author of her misery rushed upon her.
“My Lady!” exclaimed Miss Masham.
“I am not your Lady-I am—but no matter, you will know
all when I am gone-
-Gone !—Where, whither ?” repeated
she to herself. Then the sudden resolution seized her, that
she would see Mr. Ramsay—he would take her from Ross
ville--no matter what became of her after that; and, not
daring to deliberate, she hastily passed on to the apartment,
still under the excitement of feelings strained to their utmost
stretch.
Mr. Ramsay had been made acquainted by Mr. Black with
the discovery which had taken place, and, for some time, in-
dignation against Mrs. St. Clair was the only feeling that
found place in his breast; then, as that somewhat abated, his
heart began to yearn with pity towards the victim of her
guilt, and, at length, that stranger sentiment (for uncle Adam
was not prone to the indulgence of such weakness) gradually
grew into something almost akin to joy, at the thought that
she, whom he had always loved for her resemblance to his first
and only love, was indeed her descendant. The resemblance,
even in his mind's eye, grew twenty times stronger; and he
felt that he should look upon her with greater delight as the
grand-daughter of Lizzie Lundie, than ever he had done as
Countess of Rossville. She was his own nearest relation, too,
for Lizzie and he had been cousins-german-brother and
sister's children-while his connection with the Blacks was
only by half-blood. All this uncle Adam had revolved over
and over again, as he paced his little chamber, irresolute how

351
to act. At length, unable to come to any fixed determination,
he took chaise from the Blue Boar, and set off for Rossville,
where he arrived, as if Heaven-directed, at the very moment
when his appearance seemed, indeed, as an interposition of
Providence. For the first time, he voluntarily extended his
hand, and grasped Gertrude's in it, with a vehemence which
was indicative of the warmth and sincerity of his good-will:
both were silent for some moments, for even uncle Adam, for
the time, seemed overcome ; but, at length he said :-
“It is needless to say onythink aboot it-I dinna want to
hear ony mair-just tell me whether I can do you ony gude.
Will you gang wi' me?”
“Oh! yes, yes,” cried Gertrude, “ take me from this, oh!
take me now
“But stay now, are you sure you're ready?” said Mr. Ram-
say, who was not quite so rapid in his movements ; and who,
although perfectly sincere in his offer, had not expected it to
be so promptly acted upon. Moreover, he was not quite sure
that they perfectly understood each other, and he thought
some explanation necessary before they set off together. He
would fain have put the question in a delicate form, but he
had never been accustomed to sounding, and delicacy was not
his forte ; he was, therefore, obliged to have recourse to his
own method of gaining information, which was to put the
question in the most direct manner; and he said with his
usual bluntness :-
“Do you ken whar it is you're gawin ?"
The question struck like a dagger to Gertrude's heart, and
smote with the consciousness of her own desolation, she could
not speak, she turned away her head to hide the burning
drops that forced their way from her
eyes.
“I have no home,” said she, in a voice choking with emo-
“I am a beggar !"
" I'm very glad to hear't,” said uncle Adam warmly; "that's
just the very thing I wanted—I rejoice that you're to owe
naething to that prood thrawn pack—so come wi' me, my
dawtie, and ye's no want for onything that I hae to gie you.
Lizzie Lundie's bairn will be my bairn, so come your ways-
• The bird maun flichter that flees wi' ae wing—but ye’s haud
up your head yet in spite o' them a'.”
In the tumult of her mind, Gertrude hal entirely over-
looked the ties which bound her, the daughter of Jacob Lew-
iston, to him, whom she had only known as the uncle of Mrs.
St. Clair; but it now glanced upon her, that in uncle Adam
she beheld a relation of her own—the only being with whom
she might claim kindred. But she was too wretched even to
feel pleasure at the discovery, she only considered, that he

would take her away, that he would give her a shelter, and
there she would die, and be heard of no more.
“ Is there naebody here you wad see before you gang ?”
said Mr. Ramsay, as she was hurrying wildly away.
“No, no,” cried she impatiently, then suddenly stopping,
“Yes, I have one kind friend to whom I will say farewell
once more,” as the thought glanced upon her, that Lyndsay
would be glad to see her so protected, and she sent to
say she wished to see him. He instantly hastened to her,
and was made acquainted with the arrangement which
had been made, though he was still left in ignorance of the
relationship which subsisted between them; for Gertrude, in
the fervour of her mind, had already ceased to think of it,
and uncle Adam, from certain tender feelings, was unwilling
to enter into particulars.
Although he was not exactly the person to whose hands
Lyndsay would have chosen to commit Gertrude, yet, situated
as she was, even uncle Adam's home was better than none,
especially as he most cordially invited him to come to it as
often as he pleased.
“There is one person you wished me to see, and I would
not,” said Gertrude in agitation to Lyndsay, as she was almost
on the threshold to depart; " but now I would see her sister
before I go."
And the wish was no sooner signified to Miss Black than
she hastened to comply with it. At sight of her, a slight
tremor shook Gertrude's frame, but she neither wept nor
spoke ; she merely kissed her twice with fervour, then turned
away, and bade a long farewell to Rossville. The same day
Mrs. St. Clair was removed to the house of her sisters.
CHAPTER LXXVIII.
But this state ot high-wrought feeling could not long con-
tinue. In vain Gertrude struggled against the burning sense
of her wrongs and her wretchedness; in vain she repressed
each rising sigh and starting tear, with lofty scorn at the
weakness they would have betrayed; in vain she repeated to
herself, a thousand times, that she was calm—she was well.
Her throbbing head and aching heart told another tale, and
she was at length compelled to yield to the fever which, for
some time, had been preying upon her. Then reason fled, and
for many days her life was doubtful; and, during that time,
poor uncle Adam, like some faithful mastiff, hung round the

353
bed, which contained his new-found treasure, in all the stern
woe of rigid old age. Lyndsay was the only person (except-
ing the medical attendants) whom he would see; but to him
he would utter the grief which filled his heart even to over-
flowing, long closed as it had been against each softer feeling;
and Lyndsay, even in the midst of his own anguish, strove to
cheer and support the disconsolate old man. But the object
of all this solicitude was once more restored to them; the
crisis of the fever was past, and Gertrude again awoke to
consciousness. It was only then she was aware of the danger
she had passed; she had walked unconsciously through the
valley of the shadow of death; the gates of eternity had been
before her, but she had not descried them. It was then, while
still hovering on the confines of this world, that she felt all
the emptiness and the vanity of its pleasures; her dreams of
greatness—her hopes of happiness—her gay-spent days—
her festive nights, where were they now ?-Gone-and where
they had been, was marked but with shame, disappointment,
remorse! All earthly distinctions had been hers; and what
was the account which she had now to render to God for the
use of these his gifts ? On which of these was it that she
would now build her hopes of acceptance with Him; on
which of them would she now rest her hopes of eternal hap-
piness ? Alas! miserable comforters were they all !
A deep melancholy now took possession of Gertrude's
mind. Like all persons of an ardent and enthusiastic tem-
perament, she flew from one extreme to the other; and what
had formerly “whispered as faults, now roared as crimes,”
only to be expiated by a life of penitence and sorrow. She
kept her own apartment, refused to see anybody, even Lynd-
say, and passed her time in solitude and woe. In vain did
uncle Adam attempt to stem the tide of affliction, which had
thus broken in upon her shattered heart. She acknowledged
his kindness with tears and with gratitude; but when he
attempted to remonstrate with her, or urged her to see any
one, she became violently agitated, and her only answer was,
“If you love me, suffer me—ohl suffer me to die in peace.
Lyndsay had written to her repeatedly, urging and implor-
ing her to see him, and using every argument to rouse her
from this wasteful excess of grief; but she only wept when
she read his letters, and wished that he would cease to think
of one so wretched, so degraded, as she was.
Poor uncle Adam was almost heart-broken at this perti-
nacity of suffering: all that he possessed, he had told her
again and again, should be hers; she should go to Bloom-
Park—she should be mistress there; she should have every-
thing that gold and good-will could procure to make her

happy,--but Gertrude would only exclaim, “No, no; once I
had wealth and power, and how did I abuse them !-leave me,
then, the beggar that I am, that I deserve to be !"
She was in this state of mind when one day the door of
her apartment was gently opened, and Anne Leslie slowly
entered. At sight of her Gertrude turned away her head in
displeasure at the intrusion ; but Anne caught her hand, and,
as she respectfully kissed it, her tears dropped upon it. Ger-
trude stood some moments irresolute, then, throwing herself
on Anne's neck, she exclaimed, with a burst of anguish,-
“ You trusted in God, and He has not deceived you-
while I—" she stopped, overcome with the acuteness of
remembrance.
“But you will trust in Him, and He will yet put gladness
in your heart,” said Anne, wiping away the tears from her own
sweet serene face, where shone the peaceful calm of a heavenly
mind.
“No-never,” said Gertrude ; “I do not deserve to be
happy,” added she, in an accent of despair.
"Åh! who has ever deserved that happiness which we owe
to a Saviour's love? •If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark ini-
quities, who shall stand ?' Guilty and frail as we all are,
which of us would dare to lift up our eyes to Heaven, and say
we merited its favour ?"
“. But I had power and I misused it-I had wealth and I
squandered it-I had an idol, oh! my God! and Thou wast
!
« Alas !” said Anne, meekly; “who can weigh even their
own actions in the balance ? If your errors were more
glaring than mine, so were your temptations greater. He
only who made the heart can judge it, for He only knows
what have been its trials."
"He knows," said Gertrude, bitterly," that, in the day of
prosperity, mine was far from Him."
“And therefore has He dissolved those vain delights which
had taken possession of the soul He had destined for Himself.
Ah! do not look to God merely as to an offended Judge, from
whose face you turn away, but as to a tender Father, who in-
vites you to come unto Him and He will give you rest—hap-
piness greater than any you have ever known.”
“ Happiness !" repeated Gertrude. “No; my heart is for
ever closed against that !”
66 Ah! do not say so," said Anne; “ God can put an
heavenly calm into that heart which is shut against all earthly
joys.”
Gertrude felt the truth of these simple words; and, by de-
grees, her soul emerged from the dreary stupor in which it

had so long been buried, and her mind became soothed and
composed beneath the calming influence of that religion, whose
very essence is love and peace. She saw that her heart had
gone astray in its own delusions but these were dispelled.
She had received a new impulse, and she had awakened, if
not to happiness, at least to something less perishable-less
fatal. Hers had been “a young fancy, which could convert
the sound of common things to something exquisite;" but
now she bowed her heart in quietness—she knew “her
brightest prospects could revive no more, yet was she calm,
for she had Heaven in view."
CHAPTER LXXIX.
It was with emotion that Gertrude and Lyndsay met once
more, and both were struck with the change in each other's
appearance, for Lyndsay, too, looked as though he had in
deed borne a part in all her sufferings, and she was smitten
with the selfishness which had caused her so long to indulge
her sorrow, unmindful of the generous heart which had
shared in it. But if the brilliancy of her beauty was dimmed
by the blight which had fallen upon her, it had acquired a
character of still deeper interest in the eyes of those who
loved her.
“I would first see you to acknowledge the boundless grati-
tude I owe for all your kindness to me," said Gertrude, who
was the first to speak; " and then -once you asked me to
forgive her who had injured me, and I would not, for then I
was proud, passionate, revengeful; but now I would go to
her, I would forgive her, even as I trust I have been for-
given!”
“Dearest Gertrude !" said Lyndsay, with emotion, “how
happy this makes me; but do not humble me by talking of
your gratitude to me--to have done less than I have done,
when the means were in my power, would have been criminal
-if I have been enabled to serve you, that is recompense
more than sufficient. I have borne a selfish part in your
welfare, for your happiness was mine ; in vain my heart has
tried to create a separate interest—it cannot.”
“Do not talk thus, my dear friend," said Gertrude, in agi-
tation.
“Ah! Gertrude, since the same true and immortal passion
has touched our hearts, suffer me now to avow the sentiments
which I have so long cherished for you

No, no; not now," cried Gertrude, in increasing emo-
tion ; " be to me all that you have hitherto been—a friend-
a guardian-a brother-but-
She sighed, and, in spite of herself, a tear rolled slowly
down her cheek.
“ I will, then," said Lyndsay, for he feared that the ties
which bound them might be broken in the effort to draw
them closer.
Gertrude went to the house of the Misses Black, and was
received by them with tears of tenderness and thankfulness.
Mrs. St. Clair had recovered from the effects of the laud-
anum she had swallowed, and it was now her determination to
go abroad for the remainder of her life, and in a few days she
was to depart.
“ She talked much of you for some time," said Miss Black,
“and said she could not die in peace till she had obtained
your forgiveness; but of late, alas! since her health
has been restored, she has thought, I fear, less seri-
ously, and she has not spoken of you at all; perhaps she may
even be averse to see you." And she went to acquaint her
that Gertrude was there.
Some time elapsed before she returned, and she said, her
sister had been violently agitated at the thoughts of seeing
Gertrude, and had at first refused to do it; but that she was
now more composed, and had consented to receive her, upon
condition that she came alone. The room was darkened to
which Gertrude was conducted; but there was a studied
arrangement, an air of elegant seclusion about it, which at
once indicated that the inmate was unchanged-no symptom
of penitence was there. She was attired in an elegant désha-
bille, and her fauteuil,' her cushions, her footstool, her
screen, her flowers, her perfumes, her toys, were all collected
around her in the manner Gertrude had been so long accus-
tomed to see them, and on the arrangement of which Mrs.
St. Clair had been wont to pique herself as a combination of
French elegance and English comfort.
For a moment Gertrude felt a rising of disgust at this dis-
play of heartless selfishness; but she repressed it, and ex-
tending her hand, said mildly~
“I am come to offer that forgiveness which I once refused;
but God has put better feelings in my heart; and I now for-
give you from the heart, as I hope to be forgiven.”
“I too have something to forgive,” said Mrs. St. Clair,
vehemently; “I have to forgive the cruel disregard, the un-
natural, unrelenting violence with which you treated one who
had ever been as a mother to you in all but the natural tie-
I had done all for your aggrandisement, I had raised you

from beggary and obscurity to wealth and greatness, and it
is you who have brought me to shame, and misery, and
poverty—and am I to have nothing to forgive ? I humbled
myself in the dust to you, and you were deaf to my prayers-
I told you that my life was in your hands—that it did not pay
the forfeit of your rash and inhuman conduct is no merit of
yours—have I then nothing to forgive ?-But I do forgive,"
said she, extending the hand she had hitherto refused, but
with an air and manner of haughty condescension ;
my
wrongs and injuries have been great, but I forgive them.”
Gertrude almost recoiled with horror from the touch of
one whose mind was still so perverted, and whose soul seemed
to have been corroded instead of purified by the judgment
that had fallen upon her; but she meekly took her hand, and
said
“You say true--mere human forgiveness is, indeed, a thing
of nought, more blessed to them who give than to them who
receive; but I pray-oh! God, do Thou hear my prayer-
that thy forgiveness may be vouchsafed !"
She turned and left the apartment. She did not wound Mrs.
St. Clair's sisters by repeating what had passed—but her own
heart felt lighter that she had been enabled to pray in sin-
cerity of heart for heavenly forgiveness, even to her who had
wrought all her woe.
CHAPTER LXXX.
The following day a plain but handsome carriage, with suit-
able attendants, stood at uncle Adam's door, which he at first
seemed ashamed of, but after a little coyness and confusion,
he let Gertrude understand it was for her accommodation,
and proposed that they should together make trial of it.
Gertrude had never appeared abroad (except in her visit to
Mrs. St. Clair) from the time of her arrival at Mr. Ramsay's,
and a thousand painful feelings rushed upon her at the
thoughts of exposing herself to the public gaze—and the
public gaze of a small, idle, gossiping, impertinent country
town; she was, therefore, on the point of expressing her re-
pugnance, but she thought it would be unkind, ungrateful,
when he had sacrificed his feelings so far as to set up a car-
riage for her, if she did not appear to be gratified by this
proof of his affection. She, therefore, accepted of his pro-
posal, and away they drove. She was not yet sufficiently
mistress of her thoughts to bestow much observation on the
shifting scenes as they passed along, and she was scarcely

aware of where she was, or on what she looked, when she
found herself at the very door of Bloom-Park. They en-
tered, and a respectable-looking housekeeper and butler, with
inferiors, stood ready to receive them.
There's your Leddy,” said uncle Adam, giving Gertrude a
slight push, by way of introducing her; see that you a'
behave discreetly, an' when ye want onything ye maun gang
to her for't, for she kens mair aboot thae things than me."
This was quite an oration for uncle Adam, and having
made it, he marched into one of the public rooms, and Ger-
trude followed him.
My dear uncle," said she, for she still continued that ap-
pellation, “how your kindness overpowers me—I cannot
express how much I feel it."
Hoot, it's naething," said he, impatiently; “so dinna
gang to fash yourself aboot that—the best thanks you can
gi'e me is to let me see the red on your cheek, and the smile
in your e'e that used to be there, and then I'll believe that
I've done you some gude-but no till then.” And he affec-
tionately patted her shoulder, which was going great lengths
for uncle Adam.
Everything had evidently been done with a view to gratify
Gertrude's taste and feelings, and there was a good taste and
elegance in the arrangements that had recently been made,
for which, with all his good intentions, she could scarcely
give uncle Adam credit. It must be Lyndsay's doing-Lynd-
say, who knew so well all her habits and pursuits, had pro-
vided
every indulgence and facility for both—and that, too,
merely in a general way, without descending to all the little
minutiæ which it is woman's prerogative to arrange.
The news of Mr. Ramsay's establishment at Bloom-Park
soon circulated in the neighbourhood, and was not long in
reaching the ears of Mrs. Major Waddell, and caused them
to tingle with indignation and envy. In the midst of all her
finery she was not happy, for Gertrude, as uncle Adam's
heiress, was the thorn in her side—the bitter drop in her cup
-the black man in her closet—the Mordecai at her gate! Such
is ever the effect of any baleful passion, especially when
operating on a weak mind, and so difficult is it to form an
estimate of worldly enjoyment by the symbols of outward
prosperity. Her only hope was, that she would be able to
prove uncle Adam in his dotage, and, for that purpose, she
would fain have established a system of espionage between
Thornbank and Bloom-Park; but all her schemes were coun-
teracted by uncle Adam's sagacity. The only way in which
she could therefore give vent to her malice was, when in com-
pany with Gertrude, by taking, or rather making every oppor-

tunity of resting all claim to distinction solely on the ground
of birth-family-connections, and other such adventitious cir-
cumstances, as the weak vulgar mind lays hold of to exalt itself
in the eyes of those who must be weaker than itself to be so
dazzled. But in this she was met by uncle Adam, who
guarded Gertrude, in aught that in any way concerned her,
as a faithful shepherd's dog does the lamb committed to his
charge, and he was now too happy to be discomposed even
by Mrs. Waddell; he had found something to love, which had
long been the desideratum in his life, and he was gradually
getting more benign and mellow beneath Gertrude's gentle
influence. The first inconveniences of a change of residence
and habits fairly over, he even began to take some interest in
rural avocations, only stipulating that he was never to be
spoken to on any of the numerous evils inseparable from ex-
tensive property, and which, not unfrequently, embitter the
peace of the possessor—such as bad tenants-bad crops_bad
weather bad servants-poachers-robbers_trespassers-and
all the thousand ills that wealth is heir to, and which, per-
haps, bring happiness more upon a par between the rich and
the poor than is generally supposed.
One of the first to pay her respects to the new heiress of
Bloom-Park was Miss Pratt. That lady's absence, or, at
least, her silence, for so long a period, remains to be accounted
for to such as take an interest in her fate. But the simple
matter of fact was, that she had been refreshing and invigo-
rating herself at Harrowgate, at the expense of her friend
and ally, Sir Peter Wellwood, and had but just returned to
give the lie direct to the current report of Gertrude's having
been rejected by her lover on the discovery of her birth.
This, she roundly asserted, was so far from being the case,
that she had, with her own ears, heard her refuse him again
and again—it was consistent with her knowledge that she had
been long engaged to Edward Lyndsay, and, although the
little episode of the turret scene was somewhat of a stag-
gerer, yet even that Miss Pratt contrived to bolt, and settled the
matter with herself by her having had a great cold and ring-
ing in her ears all that day, which had prevented her hearing
exactly what passed. She, therefore, boldly claimed her five
guineas from uncle Adam, though how far she was entitled to
them was a doubtful question, and might have borne a dis-
pute—and time was when uncle Adam would as soon have
given her his five fingers as his five guineas upon such de-
batable ground; but now he was not disposed to cavil at tri-
fles, and he paid her the money at the first suggestion, only
taking every possible precaution against the possibility of his
giving her a note more than enough.

THE INHERITANCE.
“Well, my dear,” said she, displaying her winnings to
Gertrude,“ you see I can sing a blithe note at your wedding
-ha! ha! ha!-and, by-the-bye, do you know the news is,
that a certain cast-off lover of yours is on the top of his mar-
riage with his old flame, the Duchess of St. Ives ? They're
both together at Paris, it seems, and it's all settled. I wish
them good of one another, for I fancy they're well met, but
whether they'll hang long together is another story."
Gertrude could not hear of this event without some degree
of emotion, but it soon passed away ; and when, at the end
of some months, she read a pompous detail of it in the news-
papers, it was with feelings far removed from either envy or
regret. Still less would they have been called for could she
have foreseen the termination which a few years brought
round. Without the cement of one virtuous principle, vice
soon dissolved the tie which united them. Injured and be-
trayed by a faithless wife, the Earl of Rossville fought to
avenge his honour and fell in the cause. But long before
then, Lyndsay's virtues, and the fervour and disinterestedness
of his attachment, had sensibly created for him a warm inte-
rest in Gertrude's affections. As has been truly said, “In
considering the actions of the mind, it should never be for-
gotten that its affections pass into each other like the tints of
the rainbow; though we can easily distinguish them when
they have assumed a decided colour, yet we can never deter-
mine where each hue begins.” *
The bewildering glare of romantic passion no longer shed
its fair but perishable lustre on the horizon of her existence ;
but the calm radiance of piety and virtue rose with steady ray,
and brightened the future course of a happy and a useful
life; and Gertrude, as the wife of Edward Lyndsay, lived to
bless the day that had deprived her of her earthly Inheri-
tance. To that indeed, by the death of Lord Rossville,
who, dying without a family, was succeeded by Lyndsay, she
was again restored, with a mind enlightened as to the true
uses and advantages of power and prosperity.
