THIS little volume was published
before the middle of the last century,
and is said to have been written by a
Sister of the celebrated Fielding.
It is remarkable as having been
one of the first books of the kind
prepared purposely for children: and
in this view it may, perhaps, be found
not uninteresting to the present ge-
neration of children, since it not only
contains an exact and lively picture
of their Grandmothers and Great-
grandmothers, but was probably the
favourite companion of their youth-
ful days. -
The editor was induced to under-
take the revisal of this work by a
Parent, who is now no more. It was
indeed one of the last tasks allotted
her by that dear Parent; and on this
account she has been prevailed upon
to complete it, although, on a close

perusal, she found it necessary to
make more alterations in it than she
at first intended.
Several Fairy-tales were incident-
ally introduced into the original
work; and as it is not unlikely that
such compositions formed, at that pe-
riod, one of the chief amusements of
the infant mind, a single tale of this
description is admitted into the pre-
sent edition. But since fanciful pro-
ductions of this sort can never be
rendered generally useful, it has been
thought proper to suppress the rest,
substituting in their place such ap-
propriate relations as seemed more
likely to conduce to juvenile edifica-
tion.
In the body of the work fewer li-
berties have been taken. There the
original story is preserved nearly
throughout; while the old-fashioned
manners and modes of speaking have
been carefully retained.

THERE lived, in the beginning of the eighteenth
century, in the southern parts of England, a gen-
tlewoman whose name was Teachum. She was
the widow of a clergyman, with whom she had
lived nine years in that delightful harmony and
concord which the marriage state frequently af.
fords, when both parties are humble and cheerful
Christians. Two little girls, whom she had en-
deavoured to bring up in the nurture and fear of
the Lord, had greatly added to their felicity; inso-
much, that Mrs. Teachum, during the life of her
husband, very frequently, with great gratitude to
God, professed herself to be one of the happiest
of women. But it pleased the Father of mercies,
during one period of her life, to exercise this ex-
cellent person with many severe trials, no doubt
in order to bring her the nearer to himself.

2 THE Gover NEss; or, the
Mr. Teachum was a truly pious man, and had
great delight in contributing to the instruction of
his wife; endeavouring, at the same time, as far
as lay within the reach of human ability, to con-
duct her in that holy way in which he himself
had been taught to walk: and she, by the bless-
ing of the Holy Spirit of God, had profited by
his instructions in no ordinary degree.
The education of their children had supplied
one constant subject of their conversation: and
Mr. Teachum had inspired his wife with sen-
timents on that head so entirely consonant with
his own, that when, in his last illness, his physi-
cians pronounced it to be beyond the power of
their art to relieve him, he expressed the most
entire satisfaction with respect to his children;
being well assured that their pious mother would
train them up in the purest principles of Chris-
tianity, without the mixture of any worldly alloy.
He died confessing himself to be an unprofitable
servant, though not without a firm assurance that
his salvation would be perfected in Christ; of
which he gave evidence by the last words which
he was distinctly heard to speak:-‘‘I will go
in the strength of the Lord God; I will make
mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.”
(Psalm lxxi. 16.)
Mrs. Teachum, though exceedingly afflicted
under such a loss, yet sorrowed not as one with-
out hope. The manner of her husband's death

afforded her peculiar comfort; and she had some
consolation in immediately applying herself to the
care of his beloved children. But the trials with
which it pleased her heavenly Father to exercise
her were not yet at an end; nor was the work
which he meant to bring about by these afflic-
tions as yet fully accomplished: the gold was
not yet sufficiently refined from the dross. The
Almighty would have the whole heart and af.
fections of this his afflicted daughter; and for
this purpose it was that he exercised her with
repeated bitter trials: for the Lord doth not
afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
(Lament. iii. 33.)
Within a twelvemonth after the death of her
husband, Mrs. Teachum was deprived of both
her children by the small-pox; and her small
property being much diminished by the expences
necessarily attendant on their sickness and death,
she was suddenly reduced to a very dependent
state. But her almighty Father left her not with-
out assistance. A female friend, whom she had
not seen for many years, who resided in a beau-
tiful village near the town of Guildford, hearing
of her afflictions, invited the suffering widow to
her house; where for a considerable time she
administered to her every consolation of which
her situation was capable. And when, by the
blessing of Almighty God, in whom are all our
fresh springs, her mind was so far recovered as
to fit her for some exertion, her prudent friend

advised her to undertake, what she was so admi-
rably qualified to manage, namely, a seminary for
the education of a few young ladies.
Mrs. Teachum was pleased with the proposal,
thinking that if she could by any means become
a humble instrument of usefulness in the hands of
God, she might in some degree possess again that
cheerfulness of which affliction had deprived her,
and might be enabled peacefully and contentedly
to await that blessed change, by which through
her Saviour's merits she hoped to be restored to
those beloved friends from whom she had been
parted by death.
In pursuance of this plan, Mrs. Teachum's
friend secured a house for her in the same village
with her own: and it may, perhaps, please you
to read a description of the place.
This house was built at one end of a large
green, where grew many stately elm trees; and
from this green there branched out several narrow
lanes, formed by the garden-walls, and hedges,
over-topped by high trees, belonging to the seve-
ral gentlemen's houses and cottages, which were
irregularly scattered in its neighbourhood. The
church, and Mrs. Teachum's house which was
close to it, had in past times formed part of a
nunnery, in which, when all the inhabitants of
England were Roman Catholics, many women,
from a mistaken idea of religion, had been main-

tained together in a separate society. Mrs.
Teachum's house was built of small bricks, and
had some appearance of antiquity about it.
The windows were pointed, and many of them
projected beyond the wall of the house in a kind
of bow. The rooms were low, but very large, and
wainscoted in a curious manner. The entrance
was at the side of the green, by a porch into a
large hall; on one side of which was a parlour,
with glass doors, opening into an old fashioned
garden, where straight walks, bordered on each
side by a hedge of cut yew trees, ended in a very
pretty arbour. Here jessamines, and roses, and
woodbines, in the summer-season, poured forth an
odour so sweet, as to fill the whole house with a
refreshing fragrance; and hence nosegays were
supplied for the parlour and school-room, being
renewed every Saturday night, in order to dis-
tinguish the succeeding day as emblematic of
that eternal Sabbath which we hope to enjoy
in the land which is very far off—that land
where the rose of Sharon ever blooms, and
where the voice of the turtle is heard without
ceasing. Over the hall was the room appoint-
ed for the school-room, a large and convenient
apartment; at the end of which an oriel win-
dow, raised by several steps, commanded a view
of the garden, together with various green and
lovely fields beyond it, among which cottages
and hay and corn ricks, half concealed by the
trees in the hedge-rows, afforded a most agree-
able prospect.

6 THE Gover Ness; or, THE
Mrs. Teachum proposed opening her school
after the Midsummer holidays; but a few weeks
before that time she entered upon her house, and
received into it one young lady, who, being an
orphan, was confided entirely by her distant re-
lations to the charge of Mrs. Teachum. Mrs.
Teachum felt peculiarly happy in being able to
supply the place of a mother to this sweet young
lady; and she rejoiced also in the opportunity,
thus afforded her, of forming this first pupil to
her wishes before the arrival of the other scholars.
Moreover, she hoped, by the blessing of God,
that Miss Jenny Peace, (for that was the name
of the young lady,) being as much as sixteen
years of age, might be rendered of great use to
her in leading the younger children into a state
of submission and order. For Mrs. Teachum
knew well how important it is, that the elder
child of any family or seminary should be well
disposed, since more of good or evil is often ef.
fected by such than even by the parent or gover-
ness. With this view, therefore, Mrs. Teachum
made the best of the interval allowed her, before
the opening of her school, to instil the best prin-
ciples into the mind of Miss Jenny Peace: and
in the meantime she discovered, with peculiar
gratitude to God, that Miss Jenny had already
received the best preparatory education from her
deceased mother, whose pious efforts had evi-
dently been attended with the divine blessing.
Immediately after the Midsummer holidays

Mrs. Teachum received into her family eight
more young ladies, which completed the number
she had determined upon: for as she was mo-
derate in her desires, and sought rather to do
good than to amass a fortune, she was resolved
to take no more scholars than she could herself
have an eye to, without the help of other teach-
erS.
The names of these young ladies were, first,
Miss Jenny Peace, to whom I have already in-
troduced my readers, Miss Sukey Jennett, Miss
Dolly Friendly, Miss Lucy Sly, Miss Patty
Locket, Miss Nancy Spruce, Miss Betty Ford,
Miss Henny Fret, and Miss Polly Suckling. The
eldest of these was sixteen years old, and none of
the rest had yet attained their fifteenth year.

8 THE GOVERNEss; OR, THE
AN
ACCOUNT OF A FRAY,
Begun and carried on for the Sake of an Apple:
in which are shewn the sad Effects of Dissen-
sion and Rage.
THE greater part of the first week after the
arrival of the little girls was spent in settling and
arranging the classes. On the Saturday after-
noon, however, it being a fine evening, the chil-
dren were all allowed to divert themselves in the
garden; and their governess, who delighted in
affording them every reasonable gratification,
brought out a little basket of apples, which were
intended to be divided equally among them. But
Mrs. Teachum being called hastily away, one of
her poor neighbours having met with an accident
which required her assistance, she left the fruit in
the hands of Miss Jenny Peace, with a strict charge
to see that every one had her due share of it.
But, alas! the evil of the heart, that deadly
evil of which we have every one of us such large
experience, turned kind Mrs. Teachum's design
of giving pleasure, into an occasion of pain and

!
sorrow. There happened to be in the basket one
apple something larger than the rest; and upon
this the whole company immediately placed their
desiring eyes, every one of them crying out at
once, “Pray, Miss Jenny, give me that apple.”
Each hearkening to the suggestions of her own
heart, found some reason why she was to be pre-
ferred to all her school-fellows, and brought for-
ward this reason with all the vehemence of selfish-
ness: the youngest pleaded her youth, and the
eldest her age; one insisted on her goodness;
another claimed a title to preference from her
rank in the school; and one, in confidence of her
superior strength, said positively she would have
the large apple: but, all speaking together, it
was difficult to distinguish who said this, or who
said that.
Miss Jenny begged them all to be quiet, but
in vain, for she could not be heard; they had
all set their hearts on the one fine apple, looking
upon all the rest as not worth having. For this
is one sad effect of envy and an eager desire after
any thing not within our reach, that it prevents
our partaking of those pleasures which are ac-
tually offered us, embittering every joy, and poi-
soning every sweet. And on this account, he
who knew the heart of man, said, Blessed are
the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. (Matt.
v. 5.)
In vain Miss Jenny endeavoured to calm the

little turbulent spirits of her companions. She
spoke to them of the sinfulness of their conduct,
and reminded them how greatly they were offend-
ing God by their greediness, instead of manifest-
ing that spirit of meekness by which Christian
children should ever be distinguished. But they
would not hearken to her; and several of them not
having been accustomed to be addressed in this
manner, seemed not even to comprehend what she
meant. She offered next to divide the disputed
apple into eight parts, and to give up her own
share of the contents of the basket to satisfy them:
but she might as well have been silent; for they
were all too eagerly talking to attend to her pro-
posal. At last, as a means to quiet the disturb-
ance, she threw the apple which was the cause of
their contention, with her utmost force, over a
hedge into another garden, where they could not
get at it.
At first they were all silent, as if struck dumb
with astonishment at the loss of this one pograp-
ple, though at the same time they had a basket
full before them. But this failed to effect Miss
Jenny's intention: for though the apple was the
obvious cause of their quarrel, the latent cause of
all lay in their own evil hearts—the present fray
was no more than a breaking forth of those sinful
dispositions which exist within the breast of every
child of Adam.
Perhaps some of you, my young friends, who

peruse this little book, may never have heard the
subject of human depravity familiarly explained.
In this case, should you be led to suppose that
these little Misses of Mrs. Teachum's school were
worse than others by nature, I will here endeavour
to make plain to you the important doctrine of
the depravity of man's heart. And first, I must
tell you, that God made man in his own image,
pure and free from sin, without one disorderly
appetite or improper feeling, but holy, upright,
and glorious, like his Maker, requiring no cover-
ing for his beautiful and spotless body, nor any
imputed righteousness to conceal, as with a gar-
ment, the deformity of his soul. But Satan, the
enemy of mankind, tempted our first parents to
depart from God; in consequence of which, and
in a manner not easy to be understood, the whole
nature of man received so vitiating a taint, that
every feeling and motion of his heart became sin-
ful, and that continually; insomuch, that this
strong description of the wickedness of man,
among many others, is given in Scripture—And
God saw that the wickedness of man was great
in the earth, and that every imagination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
(Gen. vi. 5.)
But although this is universally the case of man
upon earth, although we are born children of
wrath, and heirs of hell, yet, through the mercy of
Christ, a way is opened unto us for escaping these
evils. The Lord Jesus Christ, by his death upon

the cross, paid the price of our redemption, and
procured for us the gift of the Holy Spirit of God;
which being received by faith, enters the corrupt
heart of man, cleansing and purifying, sanctify-
ing and renewing it in the lost image of God.
You are therefore, my dear children, unless you
have already received the Holy Spirit by faith
into your hearts, in no better a state than these
little girls of whom you have just been reading.
And if you have received that Spirit, you will
think humbly of yourselves, and feel a conscious-
ness that, when you are enabled to do better than
these little ones, it is not through your own
strength, but through the power of the Holy
Spirit.
But to return to my story.—As soon as the
little Misses had recovered from the amazement
into which they had been thrown on seeing Miss
Jenny Peace cast the apple over the hedge, they
all began again to quarrel; and the present sub-
ject of disagreement was, which of them had most
right to the apple, and which ought to have ob-
tained it: and their anger, by degrees, reached
such a pitch, that no words could vent half their
rage. They fell to pulling of caps, tearing of
hair, and dragging the clothes off each other's
backs; not exerting themselves indeed so much in
direct blows, as in scratching and pinching one
another.
Miss Dolly Friendly as yet was not engaged

in the battle; but on hearing her friend, Miss
Nancy Spruce, exclaim, that she was hurt by a
sly pinch from one of the girls, she flew on this
sly pincher, as she called her, like an enraged
lion on its prey: and not content merely to re-
turn the injury her friend had received, she struck
with such force as felled her enemy to the ground.
And now the little combatants, no longer distin-
guishing between friend and foe, fought, scratch-
ed, and tore, like so many furious cats, when they
dart their claws at their rivals' hearts.
In the midst of this confusion, appeared Mrs.
Teachum, who had returned with the hope of
seeing her little girls happily enjoying the repast
she had provided for them: it was not however
till after she had been standing near them some
time, that either her presence or voice could re-
cal them from the frenzy of their passion. But
when, on a sudden, they all faced about, and
saw her—shame and fear of punishment instantly
abated their rage. Each of the little girls shewed
in her right hand, fast clenched, indubitable marks
of her having mingled in the fray. One of them
held a little lock of hair, torn from the head of
her enemy; another grasped the shred of a cap,
which, in aiming at her rival's hair, had deceived
her hand; a third clenched the scrap of an apron;
a fourth retained the fragment of a frock: in
short, every one unfortunately held in her hand
a proof of her having been engaged in the battle,
while the ground was all strewed with rags and
C

tatters, torn from the backs of the little inveterate
combatants.
After standing for some time in astonishment
at this disgraceful spectacle, Mrs. Teachum at
length required Miss Jenny Peace, who appeared
to be the only dispassionate person in the assem-
bly, to tell her the whole truth, and to relate the
cause of all this confusion.
Miss Jenny felt herself obliged to obey the
commands of her governess; though her good-na-
ture led her to endeavour, as far as was consistent
with truth, to mitigate rather than to increase
Mrs. Teachum's displeasure.
The guilty persons now began to excuse them-
selves as fast as tears and sobs would permit.
One said, “Indeed, Madam, it was none of my
fault, for I did not begin: but Miss Sukey Jen-
nett, without any cause in the world, for I did
nothing to provoke her, hit me a great slap in the
face, which made my tooth bleed. The pain did
indeed make me angry, and then, to be sure, I
gave her a little tap; but it was only on her back,
and I am sure it was the gentlest tap in the world,
and could not possibly hurt her half so much as
her great blow did me.”
“I am surprised at you, Miss " answered
Miss Jennett: “how can you say so, when
you know that you struck me first, and that

yours was the great blow, and mine the gentle
tap 2"
Such like defences they would all have made,
though it was easy to perceive that every one
had been equally culpable. This however is the
nature of human creatures: until the Holy Spi-
rit of God touches the heart, it is never con-
vinced of sin, but finds something still to allege
even in behalf of the most atrocious crime.
Blessed and happy, therefore, are they who early
in life are brought to a knowledge of them-
selves.
Mrs. Teachum soon silenced the whole party;
and ordering them immediately into the house, she
took the basket of apples, and followed them in.
What the punishment was which Mrs. Teachum
inflicted on these naughty children I did not hear;
but, no doubt, it was of such a kind as they would
not easily forget. -
*
The next day was Sunday; and in the evening
calling them all to her, she represented unto them
the exceeding sinfulness of their late conduct.
She endeavoured to make them comprehend, that
the action of which they had been guilty was not
a mere hasty offence, into which, as some people
would represent it, they had been led by acci-
dental temptation; but that it was the natural
effect of evil passions abiding in the heart, from
whence, as from an evil spring, every sinful act

16 The Governess; or, the
proceeds. She then explained to them the means
by which their hearts had become so corrupt and
sinful. But as I have spoken on this subject be-
fore, instead of here repeating what Mrs. Teachum
said upon it, I will proceed to inform you, that,
when this pious woman had, as she hoped, made
her pupils acquainted with the doctrines of the
fall of man and of human depravity, she pointed
out to them the cure of these evils. And this she
did by relating what Christ had done for their
salvation; assuring them, that whoever should be
united by faith to this adorable Saviour, would
receive into his heart the Holy Spirit of God;
which Spirit, working by a secret and powerful
influence, would regenerate the heart, refining and
sanctifying it, till at length it would be completely
restored unto the glorious image of God.
Mrs. Teachum concluded this address to her
young people by a solemn prayer; in which she
confessed before God the sinful state of the hu-
man heart, and implored pardon for all around
her, through the blood of Christ, together with
those sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit,
without which, she professed her firm conviction,
that no efforts on her part would in the smallest
degree advance them in the attainment of any
real virtue.
After prayers, all the young ladies came hum-
bly to ask and receive from their governess the
pardon of their grievous offence; which she

granted them not without tears, for her heart was
strongly drawn out towards them in Christian
love. After this she dismissed them to their rest,
while she herself withdrew to her closet, there to
supplicate a blessing upon her endeavours to im-
prove the little ones committed to her care.

Between Miss Jenny Peace and Miss Sukey Jen-

and Folly in being so quarrelsome; and by her
Example all her Companions are brought to
confess their Faults to each other.
THE next morning Miss Jenny Peace used her
utmost endeavours to bring her school-fellows to
an entire reconciliation: but their minds were
not yet prepared for a cordial agreement; since
each still insisted that although she was herself
to blame, yet that her companions were much
more so. At last, Miss Jenny finding Miss Sukey
Jennett alone, the following dialogue took place
between them, which, with God's blessing, brought
about Miss Jenny's design of restoring peace to
the school.
Miss Jenny. Now, pray, Miss Sukey, tell me,
what did you get by your violent contention about
that foolish apple?
Miss Sukey. Indeed, Madam, I shall not an-

swer you: I know that you only want to prove
that you are wiser than I am, because you are
older. Yet I don't know but some people may
understand as much at thirteen years of age as
others at sixteen. But because you are the oldest
in the school, you always want to be tutoring and
governing the rest. I don't want to have more
than one governess; and if I obey my mistress, I
think that is enough.
Miss Jenny. Indeed, my dear, I do not want
to govern you, nor to prove myself wiser than
you are; I only wish that, instead of quarrelling
and making yourself miserable, you would live in
peace, and be happy: therefore, pray do answer
my question. Did you get any thing by your
quarrel?
“No, I cannot say,” answered Miss Sukey,
“that I got any thing by it; for my mistress was
angry, and punished me; besides which, my hair
was pulled off and my clothes torn in the scuffle:
neither did I value the apple; but yet I have too
much spirit to be imposed on. I am sure I had
as good a right to the apple as any of the others,
and I ought not to give up my right to any one.”
Miss Jenny. You talk of spirit, my dear
friend; but I think you do not know the true im-
port of that word: I suppose you mean courage
and resolution, by what you call spirit. Courage
is indeed a glorious virtue; but that kind of violent

20 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
spirit which persons display in a bad cause is so
far from being commendable, that it leads to every
kind of evil. Wicked men and evil angels have
this kind of spirit; but the followers of the Lord
Jesus Christ are of another spirit: in the cause of
God and of virtue they set their faces like flints;
but when self only is concerned, they are meek
and lowly, endeavouring to follow the example of
their divine Master, who, when he was reviled,
reviled not again.
Miss Sukey answered, that she believed what
Miss Jenny said was right. “I believe,” she con-
tinued, “that humble people, even in this world,
are the happiest; for my pride and hatred of my
school-fellows and companions make me very un-
comfortable. I have often,” she added, “ been
awake in the night, fretting and vexing myself,
because I felt offended with those among whom I
lived, and upon whom I would have revenged my-
self if I durst. And last night, after our governess
had been talking so kindly to us, I wished to be
able to forgive my companions: but when I tried
to forgive them, all their little spiteful ways came
so afresh into my mind, that I found myself get-
ting more angry than ever.”
“What you say, my dear Miss Sukey, does
not surprise me,” answered Miss Jenny: “the
reason why you could not forgive your school-
fellows when you tried to do it, was, because that
you attempted it in your own strength.” She then

proceeded to represent to her, as Mrs. Teachum
had before done, that no person can do any good
thing by his own strength; pointing out to her
at the same time where to seek assistance to do
well, even from the Holy Spirit of God. She
advised her also, without loss of time, to apply
for this assistance by diligent prayer: after which
she repeated these words of our excellent Cate-
chism—“My good child, know this, that thou art
not able to do these things of thyself, nor to walk
in the commandments of God and to serve him,
without his special grace, which thou must learn
at all times to call for by diligent prayer."
Miss Sukey burst into tears, and said, “Miss
Jenny, any body would think, by your way of
talking, that you were my mother or my gover-
ness! Do you think I don't know as well as
you what my duty is? I believe that I am as
capable of finding the way to be good as you
are of teaching me.”
Miss Jenny answered, “My dear friend, I do
not think myself fit to teach you; but I know
one who is: and I only request you to apply to
that Holy One, who alone can lead you into all
truth and goodness. Indeed,” she added, kissing
her tenderly, “I don't mean to vex you, but only
to lead you into the way of happiness. How
happy might our little society be, if we did but
love one another! Were we without envy, with-
out malice, and without anger; or were these

22 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
unholy passions subdued within us by the grace
of God, this place of our education would then
become to us like a little paradise.”
Miss Sukey now began to find that Miss Jenny
was in the right, and she herself in the wrong;
but she was still too proud to own her convictions.
Miss Jenny, however, was discreet enough to press
her no further at that time; but, begging her to
apply for divine assistance, she embraced her and
withdrew.
When Miss Sukey was alone, she remained for
some time in great confusion. She was in her
own room, and sitting at the foot of her little
bed. No witnesses being near, she began to cry,
and was in as great an agony as if some sad mis-
fortune had befallen her. She felt herself to be
miserable, and knew that she deserved to be so.
At last, when she had somewhat vented her pas-
sion by tears, she broke forth into these expres-
sions: “It is very true what Miss Jenny Peace
says, that I should be happier if I could get rid
of these feelings of anger and hatred. I am now
continually uneasy: I don't sleep in quiet, be-
cause I am always thinking either that I have
not my share of what is given us, or that I
cannot be revenged on any of my spiteful
school-fellows. And when I quarrel with them,
I am scratched and bruised, or reproached. And
what do I get by all this? Why, I scratch, bruise,
and reproach them in turn. If I could make my


## p. 23 (#35) ##############################################

little school-fellows my friends, I certainly might
live a happier life. But what then, have I been
always in the wrong all my life-time? for I always
quarrelled with and hated every one who had
offended me. Is it possible that I should have so
bad a spirit, as my governess says all people have?
I, who have always thought myself so wise, so
sensible, and so clever? What can I do? how can
I make myself better? I will do as Miss Jenny
Peace advises me: I will pray for help; and per-
haps my prayer will be heard.”
Now Miss Sukey Jennett had been accustomed,
as most children are, to repeat prayers in a formal
manner, every night and morning; but she had
never till now had any idea of calling upon God
with her heart: now, therefore, for the first time
in her life, she put up a sincere prayer. After
having bolted her door for fear of interruption,
she fell down upon her knees, and confessing her-
self to be a very naughty proud girl, she prayed
for help to amend her life; neither did she forget
in her address to God the Father, to plead the
merits of God the Son, recollecting what her go-
verness had told her, that it was through the Sa-
viour only that we are entitled to ask any fa-
WOur.
Miss Sukey, having finished her prayer, hasten-
ed to seek Miss Jenny Peace, anxious to inform
her, that she had taken her advice, and that she
already felt herself, by the blessing of God, in a

better frame of mind than she had been in since
the quarrel.
Miss Jenny, who had in the mean time used the
same arguments to incline the rest of her school-
fellows to a state of concord, now led Miss Jen-
nett into the school-room, where she had the plea-
sure of seeing a general reconciliation take place:
soon after which Mrs. Teachum entering, they
all united together in prayer; and concluded their
evening devotions by singing the hundred and
thirty-third Psalm.

A SCENE OF
LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,
Quite the Reverse of the Battle: wherein is shewn
how different are the Effects of Christian Cha-
rity from those which are produced by Anger,
Strife, and Wickedness. To which is added the
Life of Miss Jenny Peace.
|DURING the former part of this week, and till
Thursday evening, Mrs. Teachum never permitted
the young ladies to go out together to play in the
garden, but sent them out one by one, saying that
she was as yet afraid of trusting them together after
what had happened. In the mean time, she daily
gave them much religious instruction, leading them
to the study of their own hearts, and labouring to
forward their acquaintance with the Saviour. She
caused them to read their Bibles with diligence,
and accustomed them to sing hymns and psalms.
She took occasion frequently to address them on
religious subjects, when she carefully pointed out
to them those parts of their behaviour which were
not agreeable to the written word of God.

the quarrel, she permitted them to play all together
in the garden; and Miss Jenny Peace, who had
so greatly assisted, with God's blessing, in restoring
peace to the little community, drew them round
her in the arbour, where a second basket of apples
was provided by their indulgent governess. She
then spoke to them in the following manner: “My
dear friends and school-fellows, you cannot imagine
the happiness it gives me, to see you all so heartily
reconciled. Comparing our present feelings with
those of Saturday last, how great is the difference!
and yet there is no apparent difference in our situ-
ations. We then had our governess's leave to play,
as we now have; we then were in this lovely gar-
den, as we now are; the honeysuckles, the roses,
and the jessamines then bloomed around us as
sweetly as they now do; we had then a basket of
apples to divide, as we now have; and all the de-
lights of summer were spread out before us. But
we could not be happy: and for this reason—be-
cause our hearts were disturbed by evil passions.
Our beloved governess has since kindly pointed
out to us the source of all our trouble, and has
directed us where to apply for the healing of our
distresses. We were directed by her to the great
duty of prayer; and our prayers, we trust, have
been heard: for we now find ourselves very happy
in the same situation in which we were a short
time ago completely miserable; and we know that
no one can be happy, unless God is with him.”
Here Miss Jenny was silent, and waited for an

answer: but the poor little girls, who began, by
God's blessing, to feel that all their past lives had
been spent in sin, could only reply by downcast
looks and tears. These tears however were not
like those which beforetime burst from their swol-
len eyes, while anger and hatred choaked their
words, and their proud hearts laboured with stub-
bornness and folly; when their skins reddened,
and all their features were changed and distorted
by the violence of those passions, which made
them frightful to the beholders and miserable to
themselves. But as soon as the little party could
recover themselves sufficiently to speak, they all
with one voice cried out, “Miss Jenny, we are
sorry for our faults, and we wish to be ruled
henceforward by you.”
Miss Sukey Jennett added, “When we are be-
ginning to do wrong, you shall remind us of it,
and we will pray for help; and perhaps God, in
time, may wholly change our hearts.”
“My dear friends,” said Miss Jenny, while the
tears stood in her eyes, “God will assuredly hear
our prayers, according to that which I have read
in the Scripture—Look at the generations of old,
and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was
confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and
was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that
called upon him?” (Ecclus. ii. 10.)
Miss Jenny then set the basket of apples before

them, and invited them, in the name of Mrs.
Teachum, to eat and enjoy themselves. But now
so greatly were they changed, by the admission
of a single spark of charity into their hearts, that
each insisted upon helping her next neighbour be-
fore she would take for herself; while every one
was for giving the largest and finest apple to Miss
Polly Suckling, who, for her part, begged it might
be presented to Miss Jenny Peace. And here we
behold one beautiful effect of the Holy Spirit's
influence in the advancement of true politeness,
which does not consist (as worldly persons will
have it) in attention to certain forms and arbitrary
customs, established and overthrown according to
the caprice of fashion, but in the observance of
that divine precept, In honour preferring one
another. (Rom. xii. 10.)
Miss Jenny's joy was inexpressible in observing
this happy change in her little companions; nor
was the pleasure of her companions inferior to
her own. They now began to taste that delight
in each other's society from which their evil pas-
sions had hitherto debarred them; they now all
sat looking upon one another with mutual satis-
faction, their faces borrowing beauty from the
calmness of their minds, while all those ugly
frowns and that forbidding haughtiness which
had formerly sat on their countenances could
scarcely be remembered. Jessamines and honey-
suckles surrounded their seats and played about
their heads, of which they now would needs ga-

p
ther nosegays to present to each other; enjoying
amid these little interchanges of kindness all that
peace of mind, which attends those in whom the
Holy Spirit has inspired a wish to do well.
While Miss Jenny's heart was overflowing with
joy at this agreeable change, she thus addressed
the little assembly—“My dear companions, in
order to convince you that what I have said and
done was not occasioned by any desire of proving
myself to be wiser than you are, which thought
God forbid that I should ever entertain, knowing
myself to be a very sinful creature, I will, if you
please, relate to you the history of my past life;
by which you will see that I have been guilty of
so many faults, that I cannot say there has been
even one moment of my life in which I ceased to
Sin.
“And this has been the case notwithstanding
the peculiar privileges I have enjoyed: for before
I came to this place, I had a kind mamma to
correct me, and lead me to the knowledge of God;
and, since that time, I have had the instructions of
good Mrs. Teachum.; from whose maternal care
you may all, my dear friends, reap great advan-
tage, if you will but call upon the Almighty to
assist you. Now after I have given you the par-
ticulars of my life, I must beg that every one of
you will, some day or other, when you have duly
reflected upon it, declare all that you can re-
member of your own: for though you should not

be able to relate any thing worth remembering as
an example, yet there is nothing more likely to
amend the future part of any one's life than the
recollecting and confessing his past faults, with the
intent of forsaking them for ever, and pressing on
to better things.”
All our little company highly approved of Miss
Jenny's proposal, and promised, in their turns,
each to give a relation of her own life. And Miss
Polly Suckling cried out, “Yes, indeed, Miss Jen-
ny, I will tell all, when it comes to my turn; so,
pray begin, for I long to hear what you did when
you were no bigger than I am now.”
Miss Jenny then kissed little Polly, and said
she would instantly begin. But as, in the reading
of any one's story, it affords an additional plea-
sure to have some acquaintance with their person,
and as I delight in giving my little readers every
satisfaction that is in my power, I shall endeavour,
as justly as I can by description, to set before
their eyes a picture of this sweet young creature;
meaning to do the same by every one of our young
company, as they begin their lives.
The Description of Miss Jenny Peace.
Miss JENNY PEACE was just turned of sixteen,
and could be called neither tall nor short of her
age; but her whole person was more agreeable than


## p. 31 (#43) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMYe 31
can be well imagined, inasmuch as every change
of her countenance expressed some feeling of af-
fection or of humility. She had an exceeding fine
complexion, with as much colour in her cheeks
as is the effect of perfect health: and when she
spoke, even though you might be at too great a
distance to hear what she said, there appeared in
her manner so much sweetness, mildness, modesty,
and good-nature, that you could not do otherwise
than behold her with admiration. She had none
of those awkward tricks which many young people
acquire by carelessness, and retain from obstinacy,
because they will not labour to overcome them.
In short, Miss Jenny Peace's mother had endea-
voured to inspire her with the love and fear of
God, and God had blessed her endeavours; so
that this sweet young person displayed a gentle
and courteous spirit in every thing she did, being
at once lovely and beloved.
Such was the agreeable person and manner of
Miss Jenny Peace, who, with an air pleasing be-
yond my ability to express it, thus entered upon
the relation of her life.
The Life of Miss Jenny Peace.
“My father dying when I was but half a year
old, I was left to the care of my mamma, who
was the tenderest of parents, and whose memory
I shall ever most gratefully honour. From the

32 THE GOVERNESS; or, THE
time that it pleased God to give her any children,
she made it the whole study of her life to promote
their welfare; for which purpose she early led
them to the knowledge of our holy religion, and
pointed them to that dear Saviour, in union with
whom we can alone hope for happiness either in
this world or the next.
“My mother had six children born alive,
though she could preserve none of them beyond
the first year, excepting my brother, Harry Peace,
and myself. But although the deaths of these
little fair ones, as I have often heard my dear
parent term them, cost her not a few tears; yet
her affliction on their account was not without its
peculiar alleviations: for she still beheld her de-
parted children, with the eye of faith, existing in
a state of perfect happiness, through the imputed
righteousness of that adorable Saviour, who said,
Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not. (Mark x. 14.) After having lost, how-
ever, four dear children and a beloved husband,
my mother, though resigned, and even enjoying
much peace, always expressed herself as a
stranger upon earth, speaking of the next world
as her real home, and the place where alone she
hoped to find permanent rest in the Divine Pre-
sence: and she endeavoured, by every means in
her power, to inspire us with the same feelings.
“‘Heaven, my beloved children,” she would
often say, ‘is our eternal home, our happy resting-


## p. 33 (#45) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 33
place: there only, in the presence of the Saviour,
can I hope to see my lost husband and children
assembled together; and there, if it be not our
own fault, we may assuredly hope to mix with
them, being washed from our sins in the Redeem-
er's blood.’
“With a view to this heavenly prospect, she
made it her chief care to cultivate in us such
dispositions as are befitting the Christian charac-
ter; daily labouring at the same time to make us
sensible, that Christian virtues could not be at-
tained but by the assistance of the Holy Spirit of
God. And I particularly remember that it was
one of her first concerns to cultivate and preserve
the most perfect love and harmony between me
and my brother. My brother was but a twelve-
month older than myself, so that till I was six
years of age we remained at home together; in
which time, we often had little childish quarrels.
But our dear mother, on these occasions, endea-
voured to convince us, that such quarrels, how-
ever trifling they might appear, furnished as solid
a proof of the evil of our nature, as if we had been
actually engaged in fighting and tearing each other
to pieces; ‘An offence, she would say, “the
same in kind, though less in degree, with that of
the first murderer, who killed his brother.' And
at such seasons she usually made us repeat this
beautiful Psalm: Behold, how good and how
pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the

head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's
beard; that went down to the skirts of his gar-
ments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew
that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for
there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life
for evermore. (Psalm crxxiii.)
“Before my brother went to school, we had
set hours appointed us, in which we regularly
applied to whatever was thought necessary for
our improvement; our dear mamma herself daily
watching the opening of our minds, and taking
great care to instruct us how to make the wisest
use of the knowledge we attained. Whatever we
read she explained to us in such a way as was
calculated to make us the better for our lessons.
And among other necessary things, she accus-
tomed us instantly to obey her commands, with-
out waiting to examine the reasons of them.
* For this kind of prompt obedience,” she often
used to say, ‘is what God requires of his crea-
tures; and therefore parents, who, with respect
to their children, stand in the place of God, ought
to exact it of them.’ And, with God's blessing,
the habit of obeying our mother the moment she
signified her pleasure, was so strongly confirmed
with us, that by this means we often avoided
many harms. For example: My brother was
running one day so giddily round the brink of a
well, that if he had made the least false step, he
must have fallen to the bottom, and been drown-
ed; when my mamma, by a sign with her finger,

which called him to her, preserved him from the
imminent danger he was in of losing his life.
After which, she took care that we should both
be the better for this little incident, by represent-
ing to us, that if our present safety and happiness
were so deeply concerned in being obedient to an
earthly parent, how much more necessary it was
for us to observe the slightest indications of our
heavenly Father's will.
“My brother and I once had a quarrel about
something as trifling as your apple of contention;
and though we both heartily wished to be recon-
ciled to each other, yet did our evil hearts swell
so much with stubbornness and pride, that neither
of us would speak first: by which means we con-
tinued in a state of great unhappiness, even while
the remedy was within our reach. My mamma
observed our situation, and sending for me into
her closet, said she was sorry to see that the fear
of God had so little influence upon me; * For,'
continued she, “indeed, Jenny, I am ashamed of
your folly, as well as your wickedness, in thus
contending with your brother!’ A tear, which I
believe flowed from shame, started from my eyes
at this reproof, and I fixed them on the ground,
being too much overwhelmed with confusion to
lift them up towards my mamma. On which she
kindly added, that she hoped my confusion signi-
fied some sensibility of my fault; and that al-
though she might have adopted another method
with me, commanding me to seek a reconciliation

with my brother; yet instead of using compulsion,
she wished rather to persuade me to seek assist-
ance from on high, and to implore a part of that
spirit of forgiveness which once made the Saviour
thus intercede for his persecutors, Father, for-
give them; for they know not what they do.'
(Luke xxiii. 34.)
“As soon as my confusion would give me leave,
I thanked her for her condescending goodness,
and withdrew to pray for a forgiving spirit: after
which, I went to seek my brother. He joyfully
embraced this opportunity of being reconciled to
me; and this was one of the pleasantest hours of
my life. This quarrel happened while my brother
was at home, during one of his vacations, and I
was then nine years old.
“My mamma's attention was continually di-
rected towards keeping up a constant interchange
of kind offices between me and my brother. I re-
member once, when Harry and I were playing in
the fields, there was a small rivulet which stopped
me in my way. My brother, being nimbler and
better able to jump than myself, with one spring
leaped over it, and left me behind: but seeing me
uneasy that I could not follow him, his good-
nature prompted him to come back and assist me;
when by the help of his hand I easily passed over.
On this occurrence my beloved mother bade me
remember how much my brother's superior
strength might assist me on many occasions, and


## p. 37 (#49) ##############################################

entreated me, in return, to use my utmost endea-
vours to oblige him, that so we might be mutually
assistant to each other throughout life. Thus,
from every event which passed, our beloved pa-
rent took occasion to draw some useful lesson, as
the bee extracts honey from every flower.
“I can only lament that I did not profit more
by the excellent instructions and pure example of
such a parent. I believe no child ever spent her
time more agreeably than I did, or enjoyed more
of the pleasures of childhood: for I was always
with my mother, and she watched over me so
carefully, as generally to prevent my falling into
those grievous sins, which wound the consciences
of children, and destroy their peace.
“When my mother, at any time, perceived that
I was not cheerful, or that my mind was dis-
turbed, she led me immediately to prayer. She
taught me, that in the Scriptures a remedy may
be found for every affliction, and that the Saviour
of mankind is a friend ever ready to assist all
who call upon him.
“As we advanced in years, the friendship be-
tween me and my brother grew in proportion:
yet, tenderly as we loved one another, we were
taught, that speaking untruly in each other's be-
half, or praising each other when it was not de-
served, was a very great fault. This, my mamma
used to tell us, was not love, but hatred; since

it was encouraging one another in folly and wick-
edness, and acting contrary to that solemn scrip-
tural admonition—Thou shalt not suffer sin upon
thy neighbour. (Lev. xix. 17.)
“And now I am about to tell you, my dear
young friends, of an extreme into which I fell when
I was about eleven years old, and which caused
me at the time considerable affliction. I had al-
ways strong attachments, and sometimes allowed
my feelings so far to exceed the bounds of mo-
deration, as to make every body about me very
uncomfortable. At the time I speak of, there
was a cat which I had brought up from a little
kitten, and for which I had indulged so unreason-
able a fondness, that I could never be easy but
when she was playing around me. And in return
for this excess of fondness, the poor animal seem-
ed to have changed its nature, and to have as-
sumed the manners which more properly belong
to dogs than to her own species. It would follow
me every where about the house and gardens;
and, what was more remarkable, when fed by my
hand, it laid aside all that caution which cats are
known to exercise about their food, and would
eat whatever I gave it without hesitation, under a
seeming conviction that no harm could come to it
from me.
“I was at last so accustomed to have this little
Frisk (for so I called it) playing about me, that
I seemed to lose part of myself in her absence.

Till one day I missed the poor little creature,
who did not come, as usual, to her breakfast. I
walked out into a favourite green alley in the
garden, where she used to gambol around me,
sometimes climbing the trees with a motion as
quick as lightning, and appearing in the branches
over my head, and sometimes darting across my
path, now before me, now behind me, but never
losing sight of me. This day, however, no poor
puss was to be found in my favourite walk. I
missed her again at dinner; tea-time came, yet
she appeared not to claim her portion of cream;
and I never saw her till the next morning, when
she returned, and laying herself at my feet, imme-
diately expired.
“She had been, as I afterwards learned, stolen
by some cruel boys, who, after hunting her for
their wicked sport, had used her so ill, that she
had scarcely strength to crawl back to the house
which used to afford her protection.
“I was so affected with the sight of my little
favourite animal dying in this manner, that I
could not repress my grief; and for a long while
I would admit of no consolation. My indulgent
mamma comforted without blaming me, till she
thought time sufficient had been allowed me to
vent my grief; and then, sending for me into her
chamber, she spoke to me as follows: “My dear
Jenny, I have watched you ever since the death
of your little favourite cat, and have been daily

hoping to see your distress on her account gradu-
ally mitigated: but finding that you still persist
in the indulgence of your sorrow, I cannot but
feel greatly afflicted at the sight, since there is
reason to fear that in future life these strong feel-
ings of yours, if not properly directed, will make
you extremely miserable. As I have always, my
beloved child,’ added she, ‘been in the habit of
drawing important lessons from the little occur-
rences which daily happen among us, let me
persuade you to learn from what you have now
suffered, to raise your affections from mean and
unimportant things to such as are worthy of your
regard, and calculated to answer some noble pur-
pose. Set your heart, my dear child, to seek out
such objects of pursuit as may, under God, render
you both happy and useful. These are always to
be found in every situation. There is always
some poor baby to work for; some little child
to be taught; some old person to be assisted;
some kind brother, or sister, or tender parent, to
whom comfort may be afforded: therefore, call
upon God to direct your feelings, and guide them
into a channel of usefulness.
“‘If you give way to this melancholy, how
will you be able to please and amuse your bro-
ther, when he comes home for the holidays?—

beloved mother, “although the period may come,
we know not how soon, when you may be de-
prived of me, and may remember with some un-
easiness that you once bestowed much of that
precious time upon a little inferior animal, which
might have been more properly devoted to your
mother.’
“I could bear no more, but ran into my mam-
ma's arms. She kissed me tenderly, and said,
‘My child, pray earnestly that your affections
may be properly directed; pray that the Holy
Spirit of God may assist you in the government
of your passions: and let this little incident fur-
mish you with an important lesson for life.’
“It would be endless to describe,” continued
Miss Jenny, “all the methods this good mother
made use of for my instruction and improvement:
but all her communications had one leading,
ruling object, namely, to bring me nearer and
nearer to the Saviour. I can give you no idea
of the sweet and engaging manner in which she
conveyed to me her religious instructions, nor
how my heart seemed to glow with divine love
while I listened to her conversation on heavenly
subjects. During her life-time I was exceed-
ingly happy: but, alas! when I had reached the
age of fifteen, the scene suddenly changed, and
my dear mamma was taken ill of a scarlet fever.
I attended her day and night while she lay ill,

my eyes incessantly overflowing with tears to see
her in that condition: and yet I did not dare to
give my sorrows vent in her presence, for fear of
increasing her pain. One comfort, one very great
comfort I had, however,” continued Miss Jenny,
wiping away her tears; “and this was, that my
dear mother during her illness often expressed a
full dependence on her blessed Saviour, and a
firm assurance of redemption through him.”
Here Miss Jenny's eyes filled fast with tears.
But while she struggled to suppress the rising sobs
that interrupted her speech, and was endeavour-
ing to continue her story, she perceived that her
companions were so overcome with sympathy, as
to be on the point of breaking out into one ge-
neral cry of lamentation. This spectacle affected
her exceedingly, and hastened her through the
remaining part of her relation.
“After my beloved mother's death,” continued
Miss Jenny, “I was sent to a large school for a
short time; where, having no opportunity of re-
ceiving religious instruction, I became very un-
happy, till I could persuade my friends to place
me under the care of Mrs. Teachum, with whom
I have found myself more happy than I ever
expected to be again, after my irreparable loss.
And now I hope, with God's blessing, that while
our kind governess supplies the place of a mother
to me, I may, in some degree, supply to her that
of her departed children.” As Miss Jenny spake


## p. 43 (#55) ##############################################

LITTLe FEMALE ACADEMY. 43
these last words, the bell summoned them to sup-
per; upon which the little party rose up and
walked towards the house. Now their governess,
having narrowly watched their looks ever since
the late unhappy contention, thought she plainly
perceived, that their hearts were not entirely free
from unkind thoughts of each other, though they
did not dare to break out again into open quar-
rels. She was now, therefore, equally surprised
and delighted, as she stood at a window in the
hall that over-looked the garden, to see all her
scholars walking towards her, hand in hand, with
more than ordinary marks of affectionate fellow-
ship. And as she considered it proper to men-
tion to them her pleasure at the sight of so agree-
able an alteration, Miss Jenny Peace judged it
equally proper to relate to her governess all that
had passed in the arbour.
“My children,” then replied Mrs. Teachum,
“let us thank God for this blessed change which
has taken place among you, and give the glory
to him who maketh men to be of one mind in
a house.” -
Miss Jenny thanked her governess for her kind
approbation, and said, that if she would give
them leave, they would spend what time she was
pleased to allow them from school in the little
arbour, either in reading stories, or in such other
things as she might think a proper and innocent
amusement.

Mrs. Teachum not only allowed this, but very
much approved of the proposal: and desired
Miss Jenny, as a reward for what she had al-
ready done, to preside at those diversions, and
to give her an account in what manner they pro-
ceeded. -
Miss Jenny promised in all things to be guided
by Mrs. Teachum. And now, soon after supper,
the little girls retired to rest, being no longer under
the dominion of those uneasy passions which had
for some time interrupted their quiet: and as they
had passed the day in pleasure, so at night they
soon sunk into a soft and sweet repose.

FIR ID A Y,
The first Day of complete Reconciliation.
EARLY in the morning, as soon as Miss Jenny
arose, all her companions flocked round her; for
they now looked upon her as the best friend they
had in the world. So they agreed, when they
came out of school, as it was too hot to admit of
their taking much exercise, to retire into their
arbour, and there divert themselves till dinner-
time: which they accordingly did; when Miss
Jenny proposed, if quite agreeable to the party,
to read them a story, which she had put in her
pocket for that purpose. Beginning therefore
now to look upon her as the most proper person
to direct them in their amusements, they all re-
plied, that what was most agreeable to her would
please them best. Whereupon she began to read
the following story, with which we shall open
their first day's amusement.
*
The History of the Princess Rosalinda.
SOME hundred years ago, there dwelt on the
borders of Fairy-Land a certain very powerful


## p. 46 (#58) ##############################################

46 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
king, who chose for his queen a young princess
having nothing to recommend her but her person-
al beauty, for she was proud and selfish.
Soon after the new queen arrived at the king's
palace in his capital city, she complained that she
could not breathe in a large town, and should
entirely lose her health, if he did not provide her
with a more airy and pleasant situation.
The king, who made a point of indulging her
in all her whims and caprices, immediately em-
ployed the most skilful workmen in the city to
build her a palace in the centre of a beautiful
pleasure-garden, situated at the distance of three
leagues from the royal city. Here velvet lawns,
pools of water clear as crystal, cascades pouring
from mossy rocks, and groves of trees whose ma-
ny-coloured blossoms embalmed the air with every,
variety of spicy odour, formed such delicious
scenes as cannot easily be imagined. From this
garden the lofty hills which form the boundaries
of Fairy-Land, and which few mortals were ever
allowed to pass over, were distinctly seen lifting
their towering heads above the clouds in various
grotesque forms, some of them presenting a bare
and rugged aspect, and others crowned with fo–
rests even to their summits.
The palace which the king caused to be built
on this beautiful spot was entirely composed of
polished marble; the front consisted of colon-
*

nades or pillars, rising many stories above each
other, inclosing open galleries and balconies, in
which sofas were prepared for the queen, sur-
rounded by embroidered carpets and cushions,
on which her ladies might sit around her, and
enjoy the beautiful scenery presented to their view.
The inner apartments of this palace were hung
with silks of various hues, fastened on the po-
lished walls with rings and loops of gold; and all
the furniture of the royal apartments was equally
magnificent.
When this palace was finished, the king brought
his queen, with all her ladies, to it; and there
himself, with his courtiers, resorted, whenever the
affairs of state permitted them to be absent from
the capital city. It might have been expected
that her majesty would now have been satisfied, if
any thing on earth could make a proud, selfish,
and capricious character contented. But whereas
the queen had formerly complained bitterly of
the noise and bustle of the capital city, she now
felt as much discontented with the solitude and
stillness of her present abode; although, after all
the trouble and expence which the king had in-
curred on her account, she was almost ashamed
to complain, and indeed hardly knew what to
complain of.
One subject, however, of sorrow continually
presented itself to the queen: she had no child,
and having now been married some years, she

48 THE Gover NEss; or, THE
-
almost despaired of ever having that satisfaction.
On this occasion she gave way to the most un-
reasonable solicitude, allowing herself frequently
to break out in the most unbecoming murmurs,
and indulging herself on this account in perpetual
melancholy and ill-humour.
It happened, one beautiful afternoon, as the
queen was sitting on a sofa, in one of the open
balconies before mentioned, surrounded by her
ladies, that suddenly they were alarmed by the
piercing shrieks of some creature in distress;
and looking up towards that part of the air from
which the sound seemed to proceed, they saw
a beautiful white bird making towards them
pursued by an eagle, which every moment gained
upon it. The ladies immediately raised their
voices, with the hope of terrifying the eagle, and
making him desist from his pursuit; but in vain:
he still followed the little bird till it flew into the
gallery, and making directly to the queen, took
shelter in her bosom. The eagle, however, still
eager for its prey, followed the bird, and would
have torn it from the queen, if she had not reso-
lutely covered the little trembler with both her
hands; notwithstanding which the furious bird
attacked her with his beak and talons, wounding
her hand in one or two places before the ladies
could drive him away. This, however, they
speedily did; and, as they were not able to de-
stroy the eagle, they were glad to see him take
wing, and fly from the garden.


## p. 49 (#61) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 49
After the terrible enemy of the little white bird
had taken its flight, and the ladies had bound up
the wounded hand of the queen, they found lei-
sure to examine the little creature, who still lay
panting and as it were almost dead with fear in
the queen's bosom; when they were amazed at its
singular beauty and uncommon appearance.
This little bird was somewhat larger than a
pigeon, but far more slender and more delicately
formed. Its glossy plumage was of the most
brilliant whiteness; and on its head was a kind
of crown or diadem of feathers, while its eyes
were variegated and enriched with purple and
gold. Around the neck of this beautiful creature
was a string of purple amethysts, fastened with a
golden stud or broach, which rendered it probable
that the bird had been the property of some lady
of high rank. . -
The queen was delighted with this little crea-
ture, for whose sake she had acted with so much
spirit as to draw forth the praises and plaudits
of all her ladies: and it would have been well
if these praises had never been lavished on a less
worthy occasion.
When the little white bird was somewhat re-
covered, (for at first it seemed likely to die,) the
queen sent one of her ladies to procure for it a
cage. The lady soon returned with a large and
beautiful cage composed of gold wires; in which
F


## p. 50 (#62) ##############################################

50 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
they placed the bird, providing it with seeds,
water, fruit, sugar, and every thing which they
fancied it might relish.
The little bird finding itself delivered from its
enemy, soon began to recover itself: it partook
of its seeds and water, to the great delight of the
ladies; after which it began to dress its feathers,
which had been sadly rumpled, and to lay them
smooth upon its back. But what pleased the
queen most was, that the bird evidently dis-
tinguished her from all the ladies of the court,
bowing when she came near to it, and rubbing
its glossy head against her hand as often as she
attempted to fondle it. All this while however
it never uttered any kind of note, but remained
perfectly silent.
On the queen's retiring to rest, she delivered
the bird to the care of two ladies of her court,
with a strong charge to pay it every possible at-
tention, and bring it to her as soon as she awoke
in the morning.
The history of the white bird and of the queen's
wounded hand was soon carried to the capital
city; and, in consequence of this intelligence, the
king came the next day to see her, attended by
some of the most skilful surgeons which the city
could afford. But it was more than six weeks be-
fore the queen's wound was healed; and a scar
yet remained on her hand, when one evening, as



## p. 51 (#63) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 51
the king and queen were sitting conversing toge-
ther, they suddenly saw a chariot, to which
winged horses were attached, flying swiftly to-
wards them through the air. As their habitation
bordered closely on Fairy-Land, they were not so
much surprised at these kind of appearances as
might have been expected, since they were accus-
tomed frequently to see the fairies passing to and
fro through the air: but they were somewhat per-
plexed on perceiving the carriage to stop at the
end of the balcony where they were sitting, from
which a very beautiful lady immediately alighted
and walked towards them. -
The king and queen immediately arose to re-
ceive this extraordinary visitor; and as she came
forward to meet them, they had leisure to con-
template her figure. She was exceedingly fair
and lovely, and there was a peculiar sweetness
and modesty expressed in her countenance. She
was dressed in a robe of azure 'silk, while a veil
of delicate texture and dazzling whiteness shaded
her face.
As she drew near to the king and queen, she
saluted them in the most respectful manner, they
returning the compliment with an equal degree of
ceremony.
The lady introduced herself to their majesties
by the name of the fairy Serena, saying that she
came to thank the queen for a service which she


## p. 52 (#64) ##############################################

52 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
had lately done her, and by which she felt herself
peculiarly obliged, especially as she understood
that the queen had suffered much on the occa-
sion. -
The queen looked surprised. Upon which the
fairy explained herself, telling her majesty, that
the little bird she had saved from the claws of the
eagle was hers, and that it was extremely dear to
her, inasmuch as it had been formerly a present
from her mother, and had from that time been
her constant companion and attendant. “For,”
added the fairy, “it is a custom in our country
for every fairy to be attended either by some
favourite individual of her own species, or by
some beautiful animal. But,” continued the
fairy, “my naughty little bird one day wandered
from me, and having flown over the hills which
bound our country, was attacked by the furious
eagle from which your majesty rescued it at the
expence of receiving a wound in your hand; and
for this favour I shall feel myself under a lasting
obligation to your majesty.”
The queen said, that she felt herself very happy
in having had it in her power to oblige so illus-
trious a personage.
The king and queen then invited the fairy to
sit down by them, while they caused refreshments
to be brought; with which request the fairy very
politely complied.


## p. 53 (#65) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 53
And now, if the king and queen had been
pleased with the sweet and modest appearance of
the fairy, they were abundantly more delighted
with her conversation, which was exceedingly
pleasant. At length, the evening wearing away,
the fairy arose, and addressing herself to the
queen, said, “I am now going to require a great
favour of your majesty; but, in return, I think
that it is in my power to afford you a satisfaction
which will more than repay you for any act of
self-denial, which you may be induced to perform
on my account.”
At this, the queen coloured, for she guessed
that the fairy was going to ask for her bird:
feeling, however, that she had no right to keep
it from her, she speedily answered, “You are
about, Madam, I foresee, to ask for your bird.
You have an undoubted right to it; it is assuredly
yours; and although it will be a great trial to me
to part with it, I certainly cannot think of refusing
it to you.” The queen then called one of her
ladies, who waited in the next apartment, and
ordered her to bring the cage.
While the lady was fetching the cage, the eyes
of the queen filled with tears; and the king look-
ed as though he wished it possible that she might
keep her favourite bird: but the moment the lady
appeared with the cage, the bird acknowledged
the fairy by every possible expression of joy, and
by uttering such sweet and melodious notes as
F 3


## p. 54 (#66) ##############################################

54 THE GOVERNEss; or, THE
ravished all who heard them. The fairy also
expressed great pleasure; and, requesting the
lady to open the cage-door, the beautiful little
creature flew directly into the fairy's bosom.
At sight of this the queen burst into tears.
Whereupon the fairy coming close up to her, and
taking her hand, said, “These tears of your ma-
jesty afflict me: I therefore rejoice that it is in
my power to give you comfort, by informing you
of what, by my art, as a fairy, I am able to fore-
see. Within less than twelve months from this
time, instead of this little bird on which your
heart is now fixed, you shall carry in your bosom
a little daughter; and I promise myself the plea-
sure of being present in this palace on the day
that a name shall be given to the little princess.”
This news, indeed, as the fairy had foreseen,
entirely removed the sorrow of the queen, while
the king himself assumed a countenance of more
than ordinary satisfaction. The queen could now
take leave of her favourite bird without distress,
and attend the fairy to her carriage with every
expression of esteem and regard: the king also
assured their fair visitant that he sincerely hoped
to see her on the occasion she mentioned, and
as often before as she might be disposed to favour
them. -
Thus the fairy and their majesties parted,
mutually pleased with each other; and the fairy


## p. 55 (#67) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 55
returned with her beautiful bird to her palace
in Fairy-Land.
As Serena had foretold, considerably within
the year, the queen was happy enough to present
the king with a very lovely little daughter. It
was soon determined by the royal parents that the
princess should be called Rosalinda: but when
they came to consider what day should be ap-
pointed for publicly naming her, they became
greatly perplexed about the means of communi-
cating such information to the fairy. While how-
ever they were deliberating on this matter, a little
page arrived from the fairy, bringing her congra-
tulations on the birth of the princess, together with
an assurance that whatever day they might be
pleased to appoint for the naming of the royal
child, she would assuredly be present, without re-
quiring to be advertised thereof beforehand.
The little page who brought the fairy's mes-
sage was only two feet high; but so swift of foot,
that he was able to outrun the fleetest deer in the
king's park. -
While the queen was preparing an answer to
the fairy, the ladies of the court caressed the
little page, offering him sweetmeats and other
presents. But he was impatient to be gone; and
no sooner had he received the queen's letter, than
he returned towards Fairy-Land, swift as an arrow
from the bow.


## p. 56 (#68) ##############################################

66 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
When the day arrived on which the little prin-
cess was to receive her name, the road between
the capital city and the queen's palace was
crowded with carriages, horses, and foot-passen-
gers of every description. For the king had re-
solved on this occasion not only to regale all the
nobles and gentry of his kingdom, but to provide
for the entertainment even of the lower classes.
The parks and lawns therefore which surrounded
the palace were filled with tables plentifully stored
with provisions; while preparations were made for
every kind of amusement both within the palace
and in the open air.
In the midst of all these rejoicings, the fairy
Serena appeared: and having alighted from her
carriage at one of the gates of the palace, she
entered the great hall, where the king and queen
with the principal nobility were assembled; the
little princess also being present in the arms of
one of the first ladies of the court. The fairy
having saluted the king and queen, and congratu-
lated them on their present happiness, went up to
the little princess, and stood awhile admiring her
exceeding loveliness as she lay asleep in the lady's
arnas. -
The king and queen were greatly pleased to see
the fairy, and so pressingly invited her to stay and
partake of the feast, that she could not refuse.
Accordingly, when the ceremony of naming the


## p. 57 (#69) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 57
princess was concluded, she sat down to the ban-
quet with the king and queen and the chief of the
nobility, making herself so truly agreeable, as to
delight the whole party. In the evening, while
the company were engaged, some in dancing,
some in singing, and others in looking at curious
spectacles and interludes which were exhibited for
their entertainment—the fairy, who took no par-
ticular pleasure in things of this kind, found an
opportunity of being alone with the queen, who
had retired to the apartment of the little princess:
and there, while she sat contemplating the lovely
little baby as it lay in its cradle, she gave much
sweet and salutary counsel to the queen concern-
ing her future management of the lovely Rosa-
linda. “I am,” said the fairy, “myself the
mother of several children; and it has been my
constant endeavour to make them humble, and
teach them the duty of self-command. Self-
command is a universal duty, and tends to the
happiness of every individual: but it is of most
consequence to those who are to have most autho-
rity, as is the case with your children and mine:
for my children being fairies, will as such possess
considerable power; and your little daughter,
having the command of a great empire, will be
made, if she possesses a well-regulated mind, a
general blessing to her people. But if she should
be brought up in self-indulgence, and in a high
opinion of her own qualifications, she will not
only become a torment to herself, but the cause
of great trouble to her people: neither can she

58 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
in that case yield any comfort to her parents; but
on the contrary, you will have reason to regret
that your wish of possessing a child was ever
granted to you.” The fairy finished her discourse
by presenting the queen with a little box of crys-
tal, containing a valuable present of rich jewels
for the little princess: after which she took her
leave of the queen, having first kissed the sleeping
Rosalinda, and promised to see her again at some
future time.
I am sorry to say, that the good counsel given
by the fairy to the queen was quite thrown away:
for, instead of endeavouring to bring up the little
princess in a humble manner, and teaching her to
control her passions; there was no possible indul-
gence which this indiscreet mother did not allow
her. And though the fairy, from year to year,
visited the queen, and represented to her, in the
strongest terms, the injury she was doing her
child; yet, the queen was so absurdly attached
to her child, and so full of high conceits concern-
ing her own and her daughter's importance, that
she could in nowise think of correcting or contra-
dicting her. Moreover, she was greatly offended
with her servants or ladies, if they ever dared to
thwart her inclinations in the smallest degree.
In this manner the little princess was brought
up till she was four years of age; at which time,
the fairy again made the queen a visit. She found
the queen in a large hall, at the further end of


## p. 59 (#71) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 59
which, on a brocade carpet, the attendants of the
little princess were sitting round her in a circle.
All of them were trying to divert her; but with
such ill success, that, instead of expressing any
satisfaction, Rosalinda broke out from time to
time into expressions of ill-humour and peevish-
ness, throwing upon the floor whatever was offered
her, and even sometimes slapping the hands of
those who attempted to touch her.
The fairy had brought with her a basket of
playthings for the little princess. These play-
things were of a particular kind, and such as were
used by all the families in Fairy-Land. They
were fabricated by an old fairy called Content;
and besides being of exquisite workmanship and
extraordinary beauty, they had this peculiar pro-
perty—that whatever accident befel them, they
could not be broken or injured, except their . .
owner should strike them, or throw them down in
a fit of passion or discontent, when they would
become as brittle as glass, and fall to pieces.
These playthings were to be had in every imagi-
nable variety and in every pleasing form: but the
set which the fairy now brought the princess, re-
presented to the life, and in a marvellously beau-
tiful manner, all the beasts and birds of Fairy-
Land. The fairy explained the nature of these
playthings to the queen; and having called the
little princess, and presented them to her, she
begged her mother to communicate to her this in-
formation: after which she took her leave.


## p. 60 (#72) ##############################################

60 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
The princess Rosalinda was at first much
pleased with these beautiful toys; and amused
herself with arranging them all on the floor, call-
ing her attendants to admire them. But she soon
became weary of them; and in a few days had
destroyed all of them, by throwing down some-
times one, sometimes another, in her passion.
And thus the beautiful workmanship of the fairy
Content was totally destroyed before the fairy
Serena paid her next annual visit.
On Serena's next appearance, Rosalinda was
five years of age, and was become more passion-
ate, proud, and selfish, even than she had been
the year before. The fairy, who had been in the
habit every year of bringing the princess a pre-
sent, brought her this year a little dog, whose eyes
were blue, his back of the finest brown, and his
face, neck, and four feet, white as snow. The
hair of this little creature was soft as silk, and
hanging, particularly about his head, in beautiful
curls.
The fairy, after having paid her usual compli-
ments to the queen, asked to see the princess:
but Rosalinda was ashamed to come into the
fairy's presence, recollecting that she had broken
all her last year's present of playthings. When
the fairy understood the state of the case, she
failed not gently to reprimand the princess, and
to remind her how sad a thing it was to give way
to passion. However, upon Rosalinda's promising


## p. 61 (#73) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 61
that she would behave better in future, she pre-
sented her with the little dog; at the same time
pointing out to her the beauty of the little crea-
ture, and assuring her that if the gentle animal
were ill used, his silken hair would fall off, his
blue eyes would become dim, and he would pine
away till he became nothing but skin and bone.
The little princess, having received the dog,
ran to shew it to her attendants, leaving the fairy
with the queen, who took this occasion to point
out to her what misery she was laying up for
herself and her child, by her indiscreet and even
cruel indulgence.
While the fairy was thus earnestly conversing
with the queen, the king entered the hall where
they were sitting; when, instead of breaking off
her discourse, she immediately addressed herself
on the same subject to him. The king, who had
long perceived the faulty manner in which his
child was managed, and was fully sensible of its
evil effects on her disposition, listened to the fairy
with more attention than his queen had done: and
on her ceasing to speak, he confessed that all she
had said was but too true; asking her at the same
time what method she would advise them to take
with the little princess.
“Why,” replied the fairy, “remove from her
all those persons who have hitherto been in the
habit of flattering her and administering to her
G


## p. 62 (#74) ##############################################

62 the Governess; or, the
caprices, and place her under the charge of a
wise and conscientious governess; such a one,”
added the fairy, “as I could recommend to you,
and would bring to the palace immediately, if
your majesty approved it.”
Here the discourse between the king and the
fairy was interrupted by the queen, who, bursting
into tears, begged that no change might be made
until the fairy's next annual visit; “and in the
mean time,” she said, “I will endeavour to check
and control my daughter, and bring her into a
more reasonable state of mind.”
The king being touched by the queen's tears,
said no more; and the fairy, soon afterwards, took
her leave. -
And now another twelvemonth had passed
away, which brought the little princess to the
seventh year of her age: but instead of any
improvement having taken place in her during
this interval, she was become more naughty than
ever. For a few days she had been pleased with
her little dog, and treated him kindly: but when
he was no longer a new acquisition, she got weary
of him, and treated him with continued unkind-
ness; insomuch that he began to pine away—
his beautiful curling hair fell off, his eyes became
dim, and, as the fairy had predicted, before the
twelvemonth was nearly over, he became nothing
but skin and bone.



## p. 63 (#75) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 63
On observing the altered state of the little dog,
the queen expostulated with her daughter, and
warned her of the fairy's displeasure. The prin-
cess however would not hearken to her mother,
but answered her with great insolence; and, more
than once, she even went so far as to slap her
mother's hands, when she would have restrained
her by force from beating the little dog.
The time at length came when the fairy was
expected, and the king made a point of being at
the queen's palace on the well-known day. It
was not necessary for the fairy to ask how the
princess had behaved during the last few months;
the state of the poor little thin dog, who ran up
to the fairy as soon as he heard her voice, disco-
vered plainly enough the naughtiness of the prin-
cess. The king and queen were sitting with the
fairy when the dog ran up to her; and the queen
blushed deeply.
“Your majesty will give me leave,” said the
fairy, “to take this little dog home with me?”
“Certainly,” replied the queen, blushing deeply
again. “I can make no excuse for my daughter;
she has behaved very ill to the little dog, and to
me also on his account.”
“If that be the case,” replied the king, “ and
you find it impossible to control our little daugh-
ter, do not, my dear wife, from false tenderness,

64 THE Gover NEss; or, the
reject our good friend Serena's advice, but con-
sent that she shall bring you a governess properly
qualified to educate our beloved child.”
After some hesitation and tears on the part of
the queen, she submitted to this proposal: when
Serena, taking the little dog in her arms, depart-
ed to Fairy-Land, promising in a few days to
return with a suitable governess for the little
princess.
The fairy returned, as she had promised, in a
few days, and brought with her a lady of a very
sweet and agreeable appearance, who professed
herself willing to undertake the charge of the
princess. But as the queen would not, at that
time, consent that the ladies who had always
attended the child, and who were accustomed to
indulge her whims and caprices of every kind,
should be removed; the governess expressed many
fears that her attendance would produce no ad-
vantage to the little princess. The fairy, how-
ever, encouraged her at least to make the trial,
and promised to return in the course of a few
months to observe how she succeeded.
As the governess had predicted, she soon found
it impossible to benefit the princess, surrounded
as she was by a multitude of flatterers. So that
when the fairy returned after a few months, she
found that the child was become so humoursome
and capricious, that even the queen herself, under

evident alarm, expressed, for the first time, a wil-
lingness to adopt whatever method the king and
the fairy might recommend.
The king, being fully aware of the state of his
little daughter, was happy to find the queen in so
reasonable a temper on this occasion: and he as-
sured the fairy, that they were now both ready to
submit to whatever she might propose.
“Then,” replied the fairy, “what I have to
propose is, that you should trust the little princess
to my charge for a few years, and I will take her
with her governess to Fairy-Land, where I will
bring her up as I did my own children, who have
now left me, being married and having families of
their own. She shall occupy the same apartments
which they did, and be regulated by the same
laws which have rendered them so truly amiable,
that they are now the boast of their parents, and
the delight of their friends. I love the little prin-
cess,” added the fairy, “though I see her faults.
When I first beheld her sleeping in the arms of
her attendants, and contemplated all her infantine
charms, I felt my heart drawn towards her in such
a way as has never allowed me to cease regretting,
that she should be so brought up as to render her
wretched for life.”
The fairy ceased speaking; when the king and
queen, feeling the value of the offer she had made,
most thankfully accepted it, although not without

some natural feelings of reluctance, and many
tears on the part of the queen. The queen
begged a few months delay; but the king argued,
that there had already been too great a delay, the
princess being now in her seventh year, totally
ignorant, and becoming every day more wilful,
proud, and selfish.
After some opposition on the part of the queen,
it was settled that Rosalinda, with her governess,
should that same evening accompany the fairy to
her abode. Accordingly, after dinner, which the
fairy partook of with their majesties, Serena and
the governess being seated on each side the car-
riage, Rosalinda was placed between them by her
weeping mother; while all the ladies of the court
were assembled, pretending excessive grief, when,
in fact, they all rejoiced to be freed from the
vexatious humours of their little tyrant.
Rosalinda was too much absorbed by her own
selfish feelings to be greatly troubled at the tears
which were shed on her account. But when she
felt the carriage in motion, and perceived that it
was rising in the air, she became much alarmed,
and began to struggle and shriek violently. The
fairy, however, held her down; and telling her that
no one present would be in the least disconcerted
by her cries, she soon became composed, and sat
quietly down at the bottom of the carriage.
And now the flying steeds ascending higher in

the air, passed over the tops of those mountains
which bound the beautiful kingdom of the fairies;
when presently descending, they alighted on the
other side of them, and began to run with slack-
ened speed along the ground. The governess now
expressed great pleasure to find herself once again
in her own country; for she also was a fairy,
though of much inferior degree to Serena.
The fairy Serena then permitted the princess
to stand up and look around her. With this per-
mission she was greatly pleased; and, young as
she was, she expressed great delight at the scene
which now presented itself to her view. The
whole of the country was covered with a short
green turf, smooth as velvet, without hedge or
fence, but scattered with groves of trees of every
possible variety: some like the palm tree, with
crowned heads; others of a more spiry form,
resembling the pine; others again with spreading
branches, or large fanlike leaves; but all bearing
fruit, buds, and blossoms, in the greatest abun-
dance. A number of palaces, built of the most
splendid materials, presented themselves to the
eye, being situated here and there among the
trees, some half concealed by the woods, and
others occupying a more prominent situation.
Some of these palaces were built of crystals, some
of amethysts, some of emeralds, some of dia-
monds, others of topazes, and others of an assem-
blage of all these precious materials. Neither
was the country flat; but abounding with every


## p. 68 (#80) ##############################################

68 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
kind of variety of hill, and dale, and rock; with
waterfalls, lakes, and little pools, all clear as
crystal, and inhabited by water-fowls, some of
which were white as snow, others purple, and
others of a brilliant rose colour. But to describe
the flowers which grew spontaneously in every
part of these beautiful regions, would be wholly
impossible; and not less so, to give any idea of
the brilliancy of their colouring, or of the odours
which they scattered through the air.
After journeying through this delightful scenery
for about an hour, the winged steeds turned
aside from the high road, which the fairy in-
formed the princess led to the capital of Fairy-
Land; and passing through a grove of consider-
able extent, they at length came in view of Se-
rena's palace.
The walls of this palace were of emeralds, and
the roof of burnished gold. On approaching the
palace, the fairy pointed it out to the princess;
and then kissing her affectionately, she said,
“My beloved princess, you now see my palace,
and I hope you will be happy while you are an
inhabitant of it. .You will find there every com-
fort which you possessed in your father's house:
but neither in this place nor in any other can
you expect to be happy, unless your evil pas-
sions be first subdued, and you become truly
humble, thinking better of those about you than
of yourself.”

The little princess made no answer; and as the
chariot now drew up close to the gate of the
palace, the fairy's servants came out joyfully to
receive their mistress, and to lift the little princess
out of the carriage.
Rosalinda was astonished at the order and
beauty of every thing within the palace, while
she followed the fairy and her governess through
many large rooms till they came to that part of
it which had formerly been occupied by Serena's
children.
This part of the palace consisted of four apart-
ments, simply but conveniently furnished, with a
large closet or dressing-room. The first of these
apartments was a study, well furnished with all
manner of profitable and pleasant books for chil-
dren; the second was a sleeping-room, neat, and
airy, in which was a bed prepared for Rosalinda,
and another for her governess; the third was a
dining-room; and the fourth was an apartment
well furnished with playthings. The closet or
dressing-room was provided with a wardrobe,
containing suits of clothes of various kinds for
the use of the princess and her governess; toge-
ther with a large mirror which presented the
figure of those who looked into it from head to
foot.
In these apartments, were four little maidens,
meat, civil, and lovely, in their appearance; whose

business it was to wait upon such as inhabited
these rooms, and to provide them with all they
might require.
The fairy supped this evening with Rosalinda
and her governess in their own dining-room ; after
which, kissing the princess, and expressing a
hope that she would henceforward behave duti-
fully to her governess, she took her leave for the
night.
As the princess was tired with her journey,
there was no difficulty in getting her quietly to
bed that night; but the next morning she began
to shew her naughty and selfish tempers. As
soon as she awoke she called imperiously for her
attendants to dress her: but when they came she
refused to get up. Her governess expostulated
with her: but to no purpose. She ordered her
breakfast to be brought to her bed-side; and
when it was brought, finding fault with every
thing, she quickly required all to be taken away,
insisting that the servants should go and bring
her some fruit from a tree which she saw from her
window. But neither did this please her; for
after eating a little she threw away the rest, com-
plaining that it was too sweet;-upon which she
began to cry bitterly.
At length, however, being weary of her bed,
she allowed the attendants to dress her; though
not without finding fault with the clothes they

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 71
brought her, and requiring them several times to
be changed.
When she was dressed, her governess with some
difficulty persuaded her to go into the apartment
which contained the books. This room was
adorned with many pictures of the fairy's chil-
dren, representing them employed as they used
to be, some with their books, others with their
needle, these with their harp, and those with their
pencil. The governess pointed out to the prin-
cess the pictures of these lovely children, and
asked her if the sight of them did not inspire her
with a wish to be like them?
The little princess made no answer to her go-
verness, but looked sullen; and when her govern-
ess offered her a book, she tossed it carelessly
from her, saying that she was not disposed to read
that day. As the fairy had desired the governess
not to correct Rosalinda for a few days, but to try
every other means with her first, (for which re-
quest the fairy had a reason which will hereafter
appear,) the governess satisfied herself at present
with reasonings and entreaties. But, the more
she talked to her, the more stubborn and insolent
the child became; till, at length, getting up from
the side of her governess, she walked out of the
room.
“Where are you going, my princess?" said the
governess. Rosalinda made no answer, till the


## p. 72 (#84) ##############################################

72 THE GOVERNEss; or, THE
governess repeated the question: upon which, the
princess answered, “If you wish to know, you are
at liberty to come and see.”
The governess got up, and followed the prin-
cess; who, calling aloud for her attendants, walk-
ed into the play-room, and ordered the little ser-
vants to reach her down a variety of playthings
from the shelves on which they were ranged, and
place them on the carpet. While the servants
obeyed, the princess sat haughtily delivering her
commands; till, at last, being weary of herself
and all about her, she took up a handful of play-
things, and dashing them upon the ground, smash-
ed them all to pieces: for these toys were of the
same kind as those which the fairy had formerly
brought her, and capable only of being broken by
persons in a passion.
The governess now again expostulated with the
princess, which so increased her ill-humour, that
spurning the rest of the playthings with her feet,
she walked out of the play-room into the garden.
There, although every thing that was most lovely
in nature presented itself to her eyes, she could
enjoy nothing, but kept calling imperiously about
her, commanding the attendants to bring her fruits
and flowers of every kind she saw, and then throw-
ing them away as soon as she had received them;
saying, that some were too sweet and others too
sour, and finding fault with something in every
pleasant flower. In this manner she wasted all

the precious morning, wearying every one who
had the misfortune to be near her.
At length she was summoned to the dining-
room, where she found a neat and elegant little
repast prepared for herself and her governess:
but she had so entirely palled her stomach by
tasting a variety of fruits, that she had now no
appetite. However, she sat down, and caused
something to be brought her from every dish;
which, after just touching, she ordered away with
expressions of disgust. The governess now at-
tempted to reason with her again: but she grew
impertinent, and to shew her ill-humour got up
and left the table, calling her attendants to follow
her.
“But, my princess,” said the governess, “it is
now time for your servants to eat their dinner.”
“They may dine when I have done with them,”
answered the princess, haughtily.
The governess expostulated again. The prin-
cess was obstinate, and walked away, charging
• her attendants to follow her, till she came to the
dressing-room; where, standing before the large
mirror, she caused the servants to take out a
variety of dresses from the wardrobe and try them
upon her. But although they were formed of the
finest silks and exhibited the most beautiful co-
lours, she rejected every dress, either scattering

them upon the floor or throwing them in the faces
of her attendants. Her governess then reproved
her: upon which she became so violently passion-
ate, as to strike the little maidens who waited
upon her. At length being dressed, though not
at all to her satisfaction, and having admired her
own face and figure for some time in the glass,
she walked out into the garden, commanding her
attendants to follow her. “And will you not al-
low them to dine first, my princess?” said the
governess.
Rosalinda made no answer, but walked on.
In the garden she met the little dog which she
had formerly used so ill: he had a little recovered
his spirits, and his hair had begun to grow again.
This little creature, forgetting all the unkind usage
he had received from the princess, ran fondly up
to her, and jumping upon her, tore a small hole in
her dress, which was of a texture resembling fine
gauze. Now although the princess had never
been accustomed to care for her clothes, she was
in so ill a temper at this time, that she struck the
little dog with great violence, and drove him from
her. The governess again reproved her, but in
vain; and Rosalinda walked on, till she came to
the side of a clear lake, upon which were several
water-fowls of a beautiful rose colour. On this
lake there was also a pleasure-boat, and it was
now fastened to the shore. Rosalinda no sooner
saw the birds than she eagerly desired to have

one of them, and insisted that her attendants
should get into the boat and endeavour to catch
one for her. But when they told her that in this
case they could not obey her, she became quite
outrageous, and even attempted to push one of
them into the water.
The governess now found it necessary to inter-
fere with more firmness; and taking hold of the
princess, she with some difficulty persuaded her
to leave the water-side, and return to the palace:
where the rest of the evening was spent much
in the same manner as the former part of the day
had been.
At supper-time Serena, who had been from
home all the day, it being a great day at court,
when all the chief fairies of the land were obliged
to present themselves before the king, came to see
the princess, and to sup with her.
Rosalinda tried to look somewhat good-hu-
moured when the fairy appeared. But she did
not succeed so well as to conceal her ill-temper
from Serena, who easily perceived the state of her
mind: she however said nothing to the princess
that evening, but after sitting with her awhile,
took her leave.
There was as much trouble in getting the prin-
cess to bed as there had been in getting her up.
And now, as I have given you an exact account of


## p. 76 (#88) ##############################################

76 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
Rosalinda's behaviour during the first day which
she spent in Fairy-Land, I shall not trouble you
with the history of any more such comfortless
days. It is sufficient to say, that the princess
spent four or five more days much in the same
way, if not in a still more offensive manner: till
at length she became so violent and unruly, that
the governess found herself under the necessity of
calling in the fairy, and making a formal complaint
against the princess, declaring, that it was impos-
sible any longer to endure her capricious ways.
“And who,” said the princess, with much in-
solence, “wishes you to bear with my ways? at
least, it is not for my pleasure that you stay here:
I want no governess, nor any other person to rule
over me.”
“What!” said the fairy, “and who then would
you wish to direct and govern you?”
“No one,” replied the princess, “but myself.”
“Well,” said the fairy, “then I will for once
indulge you; and you shall be left to your own
discretion. You shall have your wish, and shall
be under no control but that of Self, till you be-
come weary of Self, and ask me again for your
governess.”
Rosalinda smiled, and said, “If you will but
take this governess away from me, you will do me
*

a great favour; and,” added she, “if she does not
return till I ask for her again, I think it will be a
very long time before she comes back.”
“Very well,” said the fairy, “I shall remember
what you say: in the mean time, as it is now
evening, go to bed; and when you are dressed in
the morning, send for me, and you shall see what
I will do for you.”
Agreeably to the words of the fairy, Rosalinda
was no sooner awake and dressed the next morn-
ing, than she called for the fairy, who came to her
immediately.
Rosalinda ran to meet her with great joy, and
taking her hand, said, “Now, Madam, remember
your promise: send away this governess, and let
me rule myself.”
“I am ready,” said the fairy, “to keep my
word.” Then addressing herself to the governess,
she said, “You are at liberty, Madam, to leave
the princess's apartments, and you will find others
prepared for you in another part of my palace.”
The governess instantly obeyed the fairy's
words, and taking leave of the princess, who
scarcely deigned to return her compliments, she
walked out of the room.
“And now,” said the fairy, as soon as the door
H 3

78 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
was shut upon the governess, “follow me, my
princess: I have sent away your governess, and I
now proceed to fulfil the remainder of my pro-
mise.” Rosalinda followed the fairy, who led her
into the dressing-room, where was the large mir-
ror; and setting the little girl before it, she said,
“You see in that mirror, my princess, the person
whom you wish to rule over you.”
“Yes,” said the princess, “I see Myself; and
I desire no other ruler than the person whom that
glass now represents.”
“On this subject then,” replied the fairy, “you
have made up your mind?”
“I have,” said the princess.
“But,” continued the fairy, “before I give way
to you altogether, I will fairly state to you, that
there is no tyranny so insupportable as the tyran-
ny of Self; because the hardest master or mistress
cannot be always present with the object of their
ill-treatment. The most miserable slave of any
other tyrant has some moments of rest and peace:
but the slave of Self never knows any comfort or
ease whatever, because his tyrant is always pre-
sent with him, and there is no possibility of escape
from him.
The princess stared at the fairy with an ex-
pression, partly of contempt, and partly of won-


## p. 79 (#91) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 79
der, while she answered thus: “I repeat, that
I desire no ruler but Myself; and I think that
if I cannot please myself, when no other per-
son meddles with me, it will be strange in-
deed.”
“Well,” said the fairy, “it is sufficient that I
have given you my opinion on this subject: I now
proceed to fulfil my promise.” So saying, with a
wand which she held in her hand she struck the
mirror before which they stood, which instantly
fell to pieces with a tremendous crash: at the
same moment every particle of the broken glass
disappeared, and in its place stood the figure
which had been represented on its polished sur-
face, fully formed large as life, the very counter-
part and semblance of Rosalinda herself.
The princess, terrified with the noise and the
prodigy which ensued, started back, and for some
moments stood perfectly silent, till the voice of the
fairy recalled her to herself. “Rosalinda,” said
she, “I have granted your request: behold Your-
self!—the very person you wished to be your go-
verness and ruler—you now have what you re-
quired. This, which is indeed your very Self,
shall be your constant companion, the regulator
of all your actions, your confidante, your counsel-
lor, and your inseparable companion; and you
shall have no other ruler, until you desire a
change, and are willing, nay, even anxious, to
receive again your former governess.”


## p. 80 (#92) ##############################################

80 THE GOVERN ESS; OR, THE
The princess looked as if she thought the day
would never come when she should wish for her
governess again: but she was some time in reco-
vering from the amazement which the fairy's won-
der-working wand had excited. By degrees how-
ever she became more composed: and beginning
to contemplate her new companion with less sur-
prise, she speedily became pleased with her, ad-
miring her form, her features, her hair, her com-
plexion, and the whole of her person; till at
length, fear being quite overcome, she began to
caress her.
“And what,” said she to the fairy, “must I
call her?”
“Soiméme,” replied the fairy.
“O lovely Soiméme,” added the princess, hence-
forth I will have no friend but Soiméme.”
The fairy then bidding Rosalinda adieu, said,
“My princess, I now leave you, hoping you will
acknowledge that I have fulfilled every article of
my promise.”
The princess assured the fairy that she was per-
fectly satisfied, and wished her a good morning;
delighted to be left entirely under the direction of
her darling Soiméme.
\
As soon as the fairy was gone, Soiméme, who


## p. 81 (#93) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 81
had hitherto remained silent, began, without cere-
mony, to call for her breakfast, and that in a
voice so imperious, that Rosalinda started. The
breakfast, however, being prepared in the usual
apartment, there could be no difficulty, she
thought, in supplying her present wants. But
when Soiméme came to the breakfast-table, there
was nothing there provided which seemed to
please her. And although Rosalinda and the
attendants reached for her and set before her
the best of every thing upon the table, she cast
all from her with contempt, giving way to a violent
fit of ill-humour, which lasted till every thing was
removed from the table. They then withdrew to
the library; where Rosalinda, taking down one
book after another, pointed out some which con-
tained beautiful pictures. Soiméme, however, was
not to be amused by these; but after yawning and
stretching over them awhile, she at length threw
them all upon the floor. The play-room was next
tried, where the little servants were directed to
take down the playthings from the shelves. And
now Soiméme became more troublesome than ever:
she always wanted that plaything which was most
difficult to be reached; which was no sooner
brought to her, than she would dash it on the
ground, and call for another.
The princess next hoped that her inseparable
companion might be better pleased in the garden:
but neither was any thing found there capable of
yielding her satisfaction. The sweetest fruits and

82 THE GOVERNEss; or, THE
the fairest flowers were all equally despised by
her: she threw them down at her feet as soon as
they were offered her, scarcely deigning to taste
the one or smell the other. -
At dinner, Soiméme was as difficult to be pleased
as on every other occasion; and after dinner, she
became more violent and troublesome than ever.
She would now be dressed afresh, and for that
purpose made every one run to fetch her different
kinds of dresses. But one was too thick, and
another too thin; some too gay, and others too
grave:—in short, nothing would please her; so
that, after many loud complaints, she finished the
evening with a violent fit of crying. On retiring
to bed with her little fretful companion, Rosalinda
could not help secretly wishing that it were possi-
ble to get rid of her, if it were only for a few hours.
In the morning, and during the next day, the
same scenes were acted over again. Soiméme was
not to be pleased by any means that could be de-
vised, neither would she suffer poor Rosalinda to
enjoy the smallest degree of peace: it was one
continued round of fretting, crying, and complain-
ing; while the more Rosalinda endeavoured to
please her, the more humoursome she became.
But the worst of all was, that the complaints of
Soiméme were for the most part directed against
Rosalinda herself, while at the same time she
would never leave her, but clung to her so closely,
and hung upon her so importunately, that the


## p. 83 (#95) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 83
princess became completely miserable. Yet being
too proud to complain to Serena of the ruler she
had chosen, she allowed many days to pass away
in this manner; during which Soiméme became
more and more violent and imperious. She at
length took to pinch and bite the princess when-
ever she offended her; and this she particularly
did when the princess was in bed with her, and
trying to go to sleep.
And now indeed poor Rosalinda began to think
of the assertion of the fairy—that the most mise-
rable slave of the most cruel tyrant had some
moments of peace; but that the slave of Self had
no rest, no hope, no alleviation of torment. Her
pride and false shame, however, for some time re-
strained her from confessing her wretched state to
the fairy. But at length, finding her situation
altogether insupportable, she one morning re-
quested to see Serena; when throwing herself at
her feet, she acknowledged her folly and pride,
humbly imploring to be set free from the tyranny
of Soiméme, and to be placed once again under
the direction of her governess.
“And are you willing,” said the fairy, “en-
tirely to submit to your governess in every point,
and never to dispute her commands? for upon this
condition only can I deliver you from the tyranny
of Self.”
“I am willing,” replied the princess, “to en-


## p. 84 (#96) ##############################################

84 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
dure any thing, rather than be subject any longer
to what I have lately suffered.”
The fairy, after some further entreaties and
supplications on the part of the princess, brought
her once again into the dressing-room, where,
touching Soiméme with her wand, the mirror ap-
peared again in its pristine state, and Rosalinda
was delivered from her little tyrant, who took
her secret place, as beforetime, in the looking-
glass.
“And there,” said the joyful Rosalinda, “there
let her stay: I shall never again take any delight
in looking at her.”
“I hope not,” said the fairy. “But you must
always fear Self, and ever guard against its in-
croachments, never thinking it possible to get
sufficiently beyond the reach of its influence.”
The same day the fairy brought her good go-
verness back to Rosalinda; unto whose control,
I am happy to say, the little princess now readily
submitted herself. And from that time she sel-
dom resisted the will of her elders; it being al-
ways sufficient for those about Rosalinda, when-
ever she shewed any symptoms of pride and wil-
fulness, to say, “We will deliver you up to Soi-
méme, and leave you with her.” This alarming
threat was invariably effectual, so firmly resolved
was the princess rather to endure any hardship


## p. 85 (#97) ##############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 85
than to be placed again under the dominion of
Self.
As Rosalinda became meek and submissive, she
became also happy. Having discarded Self, she
began to love all about her; and, perceiving the
value of her present advantages, she rapidly im-
proved in every desirable accomplishment.
And now the fairy was enabled to offer her
many pleasures which she could not permit her
formerly to enjoy. She often took her in an even-
ing, when she had performed her daily tasks to
the satisfaction of her governess, to observe the
beautiful scenery of Fairy-Land. And sometimes
she went with her to walk in a grove of trees re-
sembling rose trees, but growing to a much greater
height than that shrub is ever known to do; which
grove was the original seat of that species of
white birds mentioned in the beginning of this
story.
There the princess saw many of these lovely
birds; some feeding their little ones in perfumed
nests, formed of the never-fading blossoms of those
trees; some singing sweetly in the dark green
branches, and others hopping gaily from bough
to bough. Serena also frequently led the
princess into several green and lovely parks,
where were many deer and beautiful young fawns;
some white as snow, some of a delicate brown,
but all living in sweet harmony together, without

fear of dog, or hunter, or any other enemy. At
other times the fairy conducted her to the summit
of a hill, from whence she shewed her the capital
of the kingdom, sparkling with gold and dia-
monds, and lifting its towers and spires to the
very clouds. She, moreover, introduced Rosalinda
to her own children, who were settled in different
parts of the country. Thus, after the princess
had spent the former part of the day in improving
herself, the fairy provided her a variety of innocent
recreations in the evening. -
In this manner the princess Rosalinda spent
several years in the palace of Serena, becoming,
after the banishment of Soiméme, every day more
lovely and agreeable, progressively improving in
every branch of learning, growing more and more
humble, and discovering more and more anxiety
to advance the happiness of all around her.
At length the time came when she was to quit
Fairy-Land, and return to her parents. And on
this occasion I leave you to imagine, if you can,
the joy of the king and queen in receiving their
daughter once again, and especially in seeing her
every thing which the most anxious parents could
wish to see a favourite child—lovely in outward
appearance, but still more excellent in mental
accomplishments. -
The princess Rosalinda ascended the throne of
her father long before the death of the old king;

who, becoming weary of the toils of government,
retired at an advanced age to his queen's palace,
having first placed the crown upon the head of
his beloved daughter, with the approbation of all
his subjects, who long enjoyed the benefit of her
well-ordered government. Nor should it be left
unrecorded, that the amiable example of this ad-
mired princess produced a most desirable change
in the disposition of the queen mother.
The good fairy Serena came every year to see
her beloved princess, when she never failed to
bring with her Rosalinda's excellent governess:
the king and queen also, in company with their
daughter, were more than once permitted to visit
the fairy at her beautiful palace in Fairy-Land.
Miss Jenny Peace had scarcely finished this
little story, when the bell ringing, summoned the
young people to their dinner: after which Mrs.
Teachum taking Miss Jenny apart, enquired of
her what she had found that day for the amuse-
ment of her little companions.
Miss Jenny then taking the little book from her
pocket, presented it to her governess; who, re-
tiring to her closet, occupied herself in reading it
till the bell rang for school.
When school was over, and the little ones were
preparing for their evening walk, Mrs. Teachum
took the opportunity of returning Miss Jenny's

book, saying, with a smile, “My dear Miss Jenny,
I do not dislike your story, since its tendency is
extremely good: but I will give you a reason why
fairy-tales and tales of genii, generally speaking,
however well written, can scarcely ever be rendered
profitable, and therefore should be sparingly used.”
Here Miss Jenny coloured, and her eyes filled
with tears. Upon which, Mrs. Teachum affec-
tionately taking her hand, said, “I do not intend
by this to blame you for what you have done; but
I only wish, my dear child, to lead you from these
trifles to better things. You are, I know, strong-
ly impressed with the doctrine of the depravity of
human nature, the need of a Saviour, and many
other important truths taught in Scripture; you
know also how necessary it is not to lose any
opportunity of inculcating these doctrines on the
minds of young people, according to that scrip-
tural direction: For precept must be upon pre-
cept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line
upon line; here a little, and there a little. (Isaiah
xxviii. 10.) Now although,” continued Mrs.
Teachum, “it is not found that very young
people are profited by grave discourses or deep
discussions of religious subjects, and that instruc-
tion when conveyed through the medium of some
beautiful story or pleasant tale, more easily in-
sinuates itself into the youthful mind than any
thing of a drier nature; yet the greatest care
is necessary that the instruction thus conveyed
should be perfectly agreeable to the Christian

dispensation. Fairy-tales therefore are in general
an improper medium of instruction, because it
would be absurd in such tales to introduce Chris-
tian principles as motives of action: and yet we
are assured from the highest authority, that no one
can do well without the help of the Holy Spirit.”
Mrs. Teachum here paused a minute, seeing
that Miss Jenny Peace looked as if she did not
wholly understand her, and then continued—
“Children, my dear, should be perpetually re-
minded of this important truth, that no human
being can so much as think a good thought with-
out divine help: all stories, therefore, in which
persons are described as acting well without this
help, have a most exceedingly evil tendency. But,
since it would be wholly absurd to introduce so-
lemn Christian doctrines into fairy-tales; on this
account such tales should be very sparingly used,
it being extremely difficult, if not impossible, from
the reason I have specified, to render them gene-
rally useful. I do not, however,” added she,
“always prohibit fairy-tales, my dear child: but
when you next have occasion to read to your
companions, apply to me, and I will endeavour to
furnish you with some story of a superior ten-
dency to the common run of amusing tales.”
Miss Jenny thanked Mrs. Teachum for her in-
structions and kind indulgence; and promising to
give her an exact account of their daily amuse-
ments, she took leave, and retired to rest.

90 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
SATU R D A Y,
The second Day.
ON Miss Jenny's meeting her companions in the
morning after school in the beloved arbour, she
asked them how they liked the history of the prin-
cess Rosalinda.
They all declared that they thought it a very
pretty and diverting story.
Miss Jenny then repeated to them the greater
part of the conversation which had passed between
herself and her governess the evening before, and
endeavoured to impress upon their minds this aw-
ful truth, namely, that no human being can do
well without divine assistance; and that conse-
quently, whatever statements of a different descrip-
tion they might chance to find in fairy-tales, or
poems, or heathen histories, should be considered
as absolute misrepresentations, because mankind
being naturally vile and depraved, cannot possibly
do well without the assistance of the Holy Spirit.
The little Misses all looked very grave on hear-
ing what Miss Jenny said; and Miss Sukey Jen-

nett answered, “Indeed, Miss Jenny, all these
things are so new to us, that we cannot under-
stand them on a sudden.”
“But we hope that you will understand these
things in time, my dear friend,” replied Miss Jen-
ny; “and to this end we must pray that God will
give you wisdom from above, even that divine wis-
dom, whose price is far above rubies.” Miss
Jenny then took a little Bible out of her work-bag,
and read this verse—The natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are
foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned. (1 Cor. ii.
14.)
The little girls then began to discuss different
parts of the story of Rosalinda: and Miss Sukey
Jennett said, “I am most pleased with that part
of the story where the mirror falls to pieces, and
where Rosalinda sees her own figure come for-
ward. How surprised,” said Miss Sukey, “she
must have been l and how little did she think of
the tyranny she was about to endure!”
“Why," replied Miss Jenny Peace, “we none
of us consider what a tyrant Self is, when it gets
the upper hand; otherwise I am sure that we
should be more earnest in prayer to be delivered
from this enemy, which is indeed more to be feared
than any other, because it is not an out-of-doors
enemy, but one that is always at home." Miss

Jenny then proceeded to point out the many evil
passions which spring from selfishness: how it
leads persons to seek their own gratification at
the expence of all around them—to take offence
at the slightest affront—and to indulge a desire of
revenge as often as they fancy themselves slight-
ed. “Selfish people,” said Miss Jenny, “must
always be miserable.”
Here Miss Sukey interrupted Miss Jenny, ac-
knowledging that she herself had experienced the
truth of that observation through all the former
part of her life: for that she never had known
either true pleasure or peace till within the last
few days, when Miss Jenny and Mrs. Teachum
had led her to seek for divine assistance to con-
quer her evil and selfish passions, and to subdue
that desire which she had generally felt, of re-
venging herself on those who appeared not to en-
tertain that good opinion of her, to which she
imagined herself entitled.
Miss Jenny then asked Miss Sukey, if she were
willing to take the lead among her companions in
favouring them with a relation of her past life?
She answered, she would do it with all her
heart; and having so many and great faults to
confess, she hoped she should at least benefit her
companions by setting them an example of honesty
and ingenuousness.

The Description of Miss Sukey Jennett.
MISS SUKEY JENNETT, who was next in age
to Miss Jenny Peace, was not quite fourteen years
old, but so very tall of her age, that she very near-
ly approached the stature of Miss Jenny Peace;
though by growing so fast, she was much thinner.
Her face was naturally handsome, and her com-
plexion fine: but with all this, there was some-
thing about her which destroyed entirely the effect
of her beauty, insomuch that whoever looked upon
her felt distaste rather than admiration. Of which
this was the cause—having from early infancy ac-
customed herself to give way to all her evil pas-
sions till they had at length become uncontrol-
lable, her impatience on the least contradiction,
even from her superiors, brought such a fierceness
into her eyes, which were large and dark, and gave
such a degree of discomposure to her whole coun-
tenance, as instantly to excite the disapprobation
of all beholders. Her general manner too was
haughty, and her carriage full of self-confidence;
than which nothing can be more highly unbecom-
ing a sinful creature. But to do Miss Sukey Jen-
nett justice, her eyes, since she had been led to
seek the assistance of the Holy Spirit, had lost a
great part of their fierceness; and now, with an
endeavour to appear mild and obliging, she began
to tell her story.

94 THE GOVERN ESS; OR, THE
The Life of Miss Sukey Jennett.
“My own mamma died when I was so young
that I cannot remember her, and my papa married
again within half a year of her death. My new
mamma took little notice of me, but gave up most
of her time to visiting the neighbouring families,
and to other amusements.
“We lived in a large old country-house; and
the room which was appropriated to me was
divided from the rest of the family by a long
passage or gallery. There I was left year after
year under the care of an old servant that had
lived many years in the family. I was a great
favourite with her, and was, in consequence, al-
lowed my own way in every thing. When I was
but four years old, if any thing crossed me, I was
taught to beat it by way of revenge, even though
it could not feel. If I fell down and hurt myself,
the very ground was to be beaten for hurting the
sweet child: so that instead of fearing to fall, I
did not dislike it; being pleased to find myself of
such consequence, that every thing was under a
charge to do me no injury.
“I had a little play-fellow in a child of one of
my papa's servants, who was to be entirely under
my command. This girl I used to beat and abuse
whenever I was out of humour; and when I had
abused her, if she dared to grumble or make the

least complaint, I thought it the greatest imper-
tinence in the world; and, instead of altering my
behaviour to her on that account, I grew very
angry that she should dare to dispute my autho-
rity: for my governess, that is, the old servant
who had the care of me, told her often in my
hearing, that she was but a poor girl, and that I
was a gentleman's daughter; so that she ought to
give way to me in all things, for that I did her
great honour in playing with her. Thus I began
to think that the distance between us was so
great, that our feelings could hardly be alike.
But while I myself suffered nothing, I fancied
every thing was very right; and it never once
came into my head that I could be in the wrong.
“This life I led till I was ten years old; when
my stepmother died, and my father's sister came
to live with us. My aunt immediately took me
from under the care of the old servant, and kept
me always with her. She took great pains to in-
struct me, and procured several masters for that
purpose. I was taught to dance, and to hold my-
self upright, to do fine needle-work, and to write
. and read. I was laced up in tight stays, and had
new silk slips bought for me; my aunt being very
particular in having me neat and genteel in my
person. I attended my aunt regularly to church
on Sundays and holy-days, reading the psalms
and lessons every day, and repeating my catechism
on Sundays. But notwithstanding all this, I do
not think that I became any better than when I

lived under my old governess: for I hated the
restraint in which I was kept, and my heart was
then overrun with that pride and those evil
thoughts, which I have but lately learned to de-
tect and abhor.
“After I had been little more than three years
with my aunt, she became weary of the trouble I
gave her, and I was sent to this school; where,
had it not been for the kind instructions of you,
my dear Miss Jenny Peace, and of my governess,
I should, no doubt, have gone on from bad to
worse. For when I first came here, you cannot
imagine how angry I was to find that all my school-
fellows thought themselves my equals: so that I
was disposed to quarrel, contend, and fight about
every thing. Nor should I ever have enjoyed a
moment's ease, unless Mrs. Teachum's instructions,
through the divine blessing, had opened my eyes
to the real cause of all the torments I have ex-
perienced through life, and discovered to me the
only way in which either forgiveness of the past or
help for the future is to be obtained. For al-
though,” continued Miss Sukey Jennett, “I was a
constant attendant at church while I was with my
aunt, and read my Bible every day, yet I had no
just notion whatever of religion; which I now the
more wonder at, since I find all that has been
taught me here is so plainly written in the Bible,
that the most ignorant person might understand it.”
Here Miss Sukey ceased; and Miss Jenny, in

answer to her last remark, replied, “You express
surprise, my dear Miss Sukey, that you did not
always understand those doctrines of Scripture
which now seem so clear to you; not considering
that no person can understand these things with-
out help from above.”
Miss Sukey made answer, that she believed it
to be as Miss Jenny had said: “ for,” continued
she, “I cannot otherwise imagine, how I could
read my Bible so often when I was living with my
aunt, and go to church so constantly, and yet
know nothing of my religion.”
“And what you or I know even now, my dear
Miss Sukey,” replied Miss Jenny, “is next to no-
thing: we are like blind people, whose eyes are
just opened; we as yet can only see men as trees
walking. Let us therefore continually pray for
wisdom from above, to direct us through this pre-
sent life of sin and danger to eternal happiness in
the world to come.” -
Mrs. Teachum being now come into the arbour
to observe in what manner her little scholars were
passing their time, they all rose up to do her reve-
rence. Miss Jenny then gave her an account how
they had been employed; and she was much
pleased with the innocent and useful entertain-
ment they had fallen upon, but especially with the
plan they had adopted of relating their past lives:
and she remarked, that the grand use of number-

ing or taking account of their days, was, that they
might apply their hearts unto wisdom. (Psalm
xc. 12.) She then took little Polly Suckling by
the hand, and bidding the rest follow, it being
dinner-time, she walked towards the house, at-
tended by the whole company.
Mrs. Teachum had a great inclination to hear
the history of the lives of all her little scholars;
but she feared that her presence at these rela-
tions might so far check the speakers, as to pre-
vent a free confession of their past faults one to
another. Therefore, that she might not be any
bar in this case to freedom of speech, and yet
might become acquainted with their stories, (which
was not in her a vain curiosity, but a desire by
this means to know their different dispositions,)
she called Miss Jenny Peace into her parlour after
dinner, and told her that she would have her to
procure the lives of her companions in writing,
and bring them to her; if so be that the young
ladies were not unwilling that she should see
them: “for,” said she, “I would upon no ac-
count wish to see them, if my little pupils feel
any reluctance in granting me this proof of their
confidence.” -
Miss Jenny readily promised to obey the com-
mands of her governess.
In the evening the little company again met in
their charming arbour; where they were no sooner

seated than the cries and sobs of a child at a little
distance from the garden disturbed their tranquil-
lity. Miss Jenny, ever ready to relieve the dis-
tressed, ran immediately to the place whence the
sound seemed to proceed, and was followed by all
her companions: when, at a small distance from
Mrs. Teachum's garden-wall, over which from the
terrace the young company were able to look
abroad, they saw, under a large spreading tree,
part of the branches of which shaded a seat at
the end of the terrace, a middle-aged woman beat-
ing a little girl, who seemed to be about eight
years old, so severely, that it was no wonder her
cries had reached their arbour. Miss Jenny
could not help calling out to the woman, and
begging her to forbear; while little Polly Suckling
cried as much as the girl, and desired that she
might not be beaten any more.
The woman then, in respect to them, let the
child go, who ran away as fast as she could.
The poor woman then addressing herself to the
young ladies, as they stood looking over the wall,
said, “Indeed, my pretty Misses, you don't know
what a naughty girl this is: for though you have
seen me correct her in this manner, yet I am
in all respects kind to her, and never strike her
but for lying. I have tried all means, good and
bad, to break her of this vile fault; but hitherto
all I have done has been in vain, nor can I ever
get one word of truth out of her mouth. I am
resolved, however, to break her of this horrid

100 THE GOVERNEss; OR, THE
custom; for though I am but a poor woman,
yet I consider it as my bounden duty to breed
up my child to be honest both in word and
deed.”
“It does not become me," replied Miss Jenny,
“to offer my advice to a person so much older
than myself; but perhaps you will not be offended
at my asking whether you have put your little girl
upon praying against this sin, and seeking assist-
ance from God to enable her to overcome it.”
“My dear Miss,” answered the poor woman,
“my little girl says her prayers nights and morn-
ings with her brothers and sisters; but I do not
know that she ever prays especially against this
sin.”
“But,” said Miss Jenny, kindly, “you should
lead her to confess this her grievous offence be-
fore God, and instruct her in her religious duties,
if you have not hitherto done so; and God will,
no doubt, bless your endeavours.”
The young ladies then threw down a few half-
pence to the poor woman, and returned to their
arbour.
*
On being again seated, Miss Jenny could not
help expressing her great detestation of all lying
whatsoever: when Miss Dolly Friendly colouring,
confessed that she had often been guilty of this

fault, though scarcely ever but for the purpose of
serving a friend.
Here Miss Jenny interrupting her, said that
friendship was no sort of excuse for lying. “If
our friends do ill,” she said, “we ought to be
silent respecting their faults; and indeed it is a
duty we owe to every one, not unnecessarily to
mention their failings. But true friendship has a
view to another world, as well as to the present,”
added Miss Jenny; “and whoever encourages
another to do ill, or upholds him in an evil course,
is so far from being the friend of that person,
that he may properly be called his worst enemy.”
Miss Jenny was proceeding, but on perceiving
that Miss Dolly Friendly was covered with con-
fusion, she held out her hand to her, saying, she
hoped that Miss Dolly would take this opportu-
nity of obliging them with the history of her past
life: which request the young lady made no hesi-
tation to grant, assuring the company that the
shame she felt for her past faults should by no
means induce her to conceal them.

when she was moved by anger, which seldom
happened except in defence of some friend
or favourite; on which occasions she exhibited
a fierceness and eagerness which altered her
whole countenance. But her friendships hither-
to, though violent, had been liable to frequent
changes and interruptions; as is indeed the case
of all friendships which are not formed under the
control of religion. We may hope however that
the affection which Miss Dolly Friendly has lately
indulged for Miss Jenny Peace is of that kind
which will prove lasting, since it has already,
with God's blessing, produced a happy influence
upon her conduct.
Miss Dolly Friendly then no sooner understood
that it was Miss Jenny Peace's wish that she
should relate her history, than she immediately
began as follows.
The Life of Miss Dolly Friendly.
“I was bred up till I was nine years of age with
a sister, who was one year younger than myself.
I had a very great love for my sister, and yet I
fear that I did not make her happy; for I was so
extremely jealous lest she should like any one as
well as she did me, that I was on the constant fret.
Sometimes my little sister Molly could do nothing
to offend me; her every word and act appeared
right in my eyes: and my friendship for her, as

I called it, was carried to such a height, that I
scrupled no lies to excuse her faults, justifying
whatever she did, and thinking it right only be-
cause she did it. I was ready to fight all her
battles, whether right or wrong, and hated every
body that offended her. But in the midst of all
this apparent love, I was jealous and uneasy; and
made her so too, because I used to think that I
did not receive from her a suitable return. And
all this time every person that visited at our house
was accustomed to speak in high terms of my af-
fectionate conduct towards my sister, filling me
with much self-conceit on that account.
“At length my poor little sister grew very sick-
ly, and died. I appeared to mourn very deeply
for her; and yet, not long afterwards, so volatile
was I that I attached myself to a young lady of
my own age, or rather older, who lived next door
to us. She was not of a good character; and,
being extremely artful, she led me into many great
faults, insomuch that my mother shortly insisted
upon my giving her up ; after which I was not
allowed to go out, except in company with my
mother. But it was not long before this habit
of forming violent attachments became a snare to
me again: for my mother having lately hired a
new waiting-maid, my wandering affections were
soon fixed upon her, and to her I went with
my complaints as often as I was controlled
or contradicted. She soothed and flattered
me; and I, in return, concealed from my mo-

guilty.
“At length, however, my mother found out this
indiscreet intimacy, and sent me hither; where
I immediately attached myself to Miss Nancy
Spruce: and I should, no doubt, have been the
means of leading her into many indiscretions by
my foolish affection, had not you, my dear Miss
Jenny, given us your good advice, and taught us
the necessity of maintaining a more reasonable
mode of conduct.”
“Give not that honour to me, my dear Miss
Dolly,” replied Miss Jenny, “but to God: for if
I have been enabled to offer you any good advice,
it was by the assistance of God, since of ourselves
we can do no one good thing.”
Miss Dolly Friendly replied, “Indeed, Miss
Jenny, I begin to think as you do upon this sub-
ject; although, a very little time ago, I should
have been exceedingly offended if any one had
told me that I was a sinful person, having always
Iooked upon myself as a very good girl.”
The bell now summoned our little company to
supper, when they all went into the house in a
sweet and peaceful state of mind.

S UN DAY,
The third Day.
ON this blessed day the little society were awa-
kened by the ringing of bells; and being all dress-
ed with neatness, they assembled for prayers in
the school-room. The morning was exceedingly
fine, and the windows of the school-room being
open, the whole room was filled with the fragrant
smell of flowers. The little party had already
learned from Mrs. Teachum and Miss Jenny Peace
to love the Lord's-day more than any other, and
to consider it as a day of sacred rejoicing, when
the usual labours of the week were to be laid
aside, and the service of God to be attended
upon without interruption.
After breakfast each little Miss took her Bible,
for Mrs. Teachum had expressed her desire that
no other but the book of God should be studied
on the Lord's-day; and as each of the children
was provided with a Bible, it was very pleasing
to see so many little immortal creatures employed
in studying the words of everlasting life. When
the hour of divine service arrived, Mrs. Teachum
put Miss Polly Suckling before her, while the rest

followed, two and two, with perfect regularity to
church. -
Mrs. Teachum expressed great pleasure in no-
ticing that her scholars, notwithstanding their
tender age, behaved with becoming seriousness
and decorum at this sacred place.
They went to church again in the same order,
and behaved with equal decency in the afternoon:
after which, by invitation, the young people all
drank tea in Mrs. Teachum's parlour.
The conversation, during tea-time, turned upon
religious subjects, which Mrs. Teachum was anxi-
ous to render particularly agreeable to the young
people.
After tea, the Bible was again produced, and
Miss Jenny Peace, as the eldest, was directed to
read such parts as Mrs. Teachum thought proper
to select.
The Bible is full of beautiful stories, which the
more we read, the more interesting they become.
This holy book, unlike every other, never wea-
ries the attentive reader, but the more it is stu-
died, the more it delights. And to speak its
highest praise, this is the book, which, rightly
understood, leads the wandering sinner back to
his God, and sets him in the way of everlasting
happiness.

Many of these little ones had never till this
evening found any real pleasure in listening to the
Scriptures; for till now they had not that prepa-
ration of heart which is necessary in order to ren-
der the word of God acceptable. But having
now, by God's blessing, conceived the wish to do
well, they found a pleasure in their religious du-
ties of which they formerly could not even have
formed an idea.
At an early hour the little party retired to their
sleeping-room, where they enjoyed that sweet and
peaceful repose, to which the tranquillizing exer-
cises of the Sabbath do naturally lead the way.

M ON DAY,
The fourth Day.
As soon as school was over in the morning, our
little company were impatient to go into the ar-
bour, to hear the story which their kind governess
had promised them on the Saturday before. But
Mrs. Teachum was now obliged to inform them
that they must be otherwise employed: for that
their writing-master, who lived some miles off,
and who had been expected in the afternoon, was
just then come in, and begged their attendance,
though out of school-time, because he was obliged
to be at home again before the afternoon, to meet
a person from whom he expected a great favour,
and who would be highly disobliged should he not
keep his appointment. “And I know,” said Mrs.
Teachum, “my little dears, you would rather lose
your own amusement than let any one suffer a
real inconvenience on your account.”
They all readily complied, and cheerfully went
to their writing. So in the afternoon Mrs. Teach-
um permitted them to leave off work an hour
sooner than usual, as a reward for the readiness
they had shewn to give up their morning amuse-

ment: and being met in the arbour, Miss Jenny
Peace read to them as follows.
The History of Albert de la Hauteville.
IN the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, King of
France, there was a large party among the king's
ministers who were the determined enemies of
pure religion, and who frequently employed them-
selves in forming plans for the destruction of such
persons in the king's dominions as most eminently
devoted themselves to the service of God.
Among those against whom the rancour of these
wicked persons was particularly excited, were a
certain race of poor people who inhabited the
valleys of Piedmont, a district in the south of
France, lying between the Alps and Pyrenees.
These poor people, called the Waldenses, hav-
ing lived for many ages shut out from the world,
in deep and sequestered valleys, had there pre-
served among them the purity of the Christian
religion without any mixture of human traditions;
while all the surrounding countries were polluted
with the errors of popery. They had no images
in their chºrches; they invoked neither saints nor
angels; neither did they acknowledge any other
mediator than Jesus Christ, nor rely upon any
other merit than that of his immaculate righteous-
ness and his atoning death. They were a light
L

110 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
shining in darkness. They were a poor and
afflicted people, left in the midst of the wicked
nations of Europe, trusting in the name of the
Lord. (Zeph. iii. 12.)
It might seem extraordinary how so poor a race
of people as these Waldenses, living in retirement,
and quietly serving their God, should incur the
hatred of the great men of a flourishing court, did
we not know, from the experience of ages, that
the children of this world are always unfriendly
to the children of God. Our Lord himself pre-
dicted that it should be so—If the world hate
you, said he, in that last unutterably tender and
affectionate discourse which he held with his dis-
ciples, ye know that it hated me before it hated
wou. If ye were of the world, the world would
love its own: but because ye are not of the world,
but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore
the world hateth you. (John xv. 18, 19.)
Accordingly therefore, as their master Christ
had foretold, the Waldenses were hated by the
world, and many plans for their destruction were
formed by their enemies. Among other plans, it
was proposed that some of the persecuting party
should visit the inhabitants of these valleys in
disguise, for the purpose of procuring evidence
of their treasonable words or practices against
church or state, if so be that any of their private
words or actions might by any means be so inter-
preted. Several persons came forward to offer

themselves for this horrible service: but he that
was most importunate to be thus employed was
Albert de la Hauteville, a young man of noble
parentage, great address, handsome and accom-
plished, but utterly destitute of religious or moral
feeling. Albert was believed to be best capable
of accomplishing the hateful design of the court
party, and his services accordingly were accepted
in preference to those of every other person.
Albert de la Hauteville having received suitable
instructions from his base employers, and being
provided with every thing necessary for his jour-
ney, set out without loss of time from Paris. On
arriving within a day's journey of the mountains,
he there put off his own dress, and assumed that
of a peasant of those parts. Then taking a staff
in his hand, together with one of the books or con-
fessions of the Waldenses, called The Noble Les-
son, with a copy of which he had taken care to
provide himself, he penetrated on foot into the
valleys, endeavouring to make acquaintance with
their poor and simple inhabitants wherever he
went. He travelled for some days through scenes
of extraordinary beauty, stopping at many houses
in his way; but without seeing or hearing any
thing that could be turned to the condemnation of
these innocent people.
His first night's lodging was at a cottage on the
declivity of a hill. The cottage was so low, and
the hill so steep, that the back part of the thatch

112 THE GOVERNEss; or, the
of the house rested on the side of the hill; while
the front of the cottage overhung a deep dingle,
thickly planted with trees, which almost hid from the
eye a stream that rushed rapidly along the bottom.
Here lived a very old man and his daughter,
who was herself a widow, and not very young.
On the traveller's asking for a night's lodging, these
poor people received him kindly, supplying him
with goat's milk and cakes baked on the hearth.
He, in the mean time, pretending to be one of their
own way of thinking, led the old man to speak
upon religious subjects: and when he believed that
he had won his confidence, he ventured to insinu-
ate something against the king and the Roman
Catholic doctrines, hoping thus to draw on his ve-
nerable host to utter something, which he might
convert to the horrible purpose of his journey.
But the old man replied, “My son, if you really
are a sincere child of God, you will find enough to
do in your own soul's concerns, without meddling
in matters which belong not to you."
Albert de la Hauteville here stood rebuked and
ashamed before this venerable Christian: he could
not look up; deep blushes covered his cheek; and
he felt as if the old man could look into his very
heart. His confusion however not being perceiv-
ed, he speedily recovered himself, though without
attempting any thing further in that place.
The next evening Monsieur de la Hauteville

arrived at a cottage in the very deepest recess of
a valley, lying between two lofty mountains. The
last rays of the departing sun had shed a faint
light on their towering summits, when he knocked
at the cottage-door. He was immediately admit-
ted into a little neat room, where a father and
mother, and six smiling children of various ages,
were taking their last meal, of which he was kindly
invited to partake.
Here again, after supper, this wicked young
man endeavoured to discover the real sentiments
of the poor inhabitants of the cottage, and,
through them, of their neighbours in general, re-
specting the king and the religion of the Papists.
But the father of the family, believing his visitor
to be one of his own religion and country, ad-
vised him to leave these public matters, and to
look to his own spiritual concerns, as a better
and more profitable occupation of his time and
thoughts than that of speculating upon national
affairs.
In the morning Albert took leave of these poor
people, not in the least softened by their kindness,
but rather enraged to find that as yet he had dis-
covered no matter of information against the inha-
bitants of the valleys. -
It would make my story too long, were I to
describe all the wanderings of this young man
among these valleys. Suffice it to say, that con-

triving to get himself admitted through several of
those passes, which they were in the habit of keep-
ing guarded for fear of surprisals from their ene-
mies, he at length arrived at one of their most
considerable villages. This village lying at the
foot of one of the highest mountains, he resolved
to rest there awhile, before he attempted to cross
the mountains; which he was determined to do,
meaning to return through the valleys by a route
different from that which had conducted him to
this spot.
Now, as he remained quiet in this village, so-
liciting rest of body for a few days before he
undertook fresh fatigues, his mind became trou-
bled with many uneasy thoughts, among which
those of shame and rage arising from the recol-
lection of his hitherto baffled attempts, were the
most powerful and tormenting. And such was
the agitation of his thoughts, that he could take
no rest, finding it almost impossible any longer
to preserve the character which he had assum-
ed among the inhabitants of the valleys.
Amid these oppressive feelings, he at length
resolved to continue his journey; and, for that
purpose, sought a guide to conduct him over the
mountain. -
A guide being obtained, he was advised also to
procure a horse, as the passage was long, though
not particularly dangerous.


## p. 115 (#127) ############################################

LiTTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 115
Albert's journey was delayed for some days,
owing to the difficulty of procuring him a horse.
And even after the arrival of the horse, both the
guide and the villagers besought Monsieur de la
Hauteville still to defer his journey a little longer,
as the present appearance of the mountain por-
tended an approaching tempest, its summit being
unusually covered with black clouds, from which
frequent flashes of lightning were emitted. The
young man's impatience, however, would admit of
no further delay: so, after giving his horse one
night's rest, he set out with his guide early the
next morning, even before it was light.
Monsieur de la Hauteville, following his guide,
had reached a small house at a very considerable
height, where refreshments of a coarse kind might
be obtained, before the sun arose.
Here they stopped, and here Albert was again
advised not to proceed any further at present; as
those who were best acquainted with the appear-
ance of the sky in that part of the country, pre-
dicted a tremendous storm. The rash young man,
however, would not be advised, but breaking out
with a violence which made his simple guide to
tremble, he commanded him to lead the way;
while he followed, impiously braving every dan-
ger that threatened him.
The travellers continued to ascend the moun-
tain during the whole of the former part of the

116 The Gover NESS; OR, THE
day, the guide expressing a hope that, God per-
mitting, they might reach some place of shelter
and refreshment on the opposite side of the moun-
tain, before night should come on, and before the
louring storm should break over their heads.
About five o'clock, however, the threatening
storm burst upon them with a violence which
surpassed all that had been predicted. The wind
roaring and rushing down the valleys made it al-
most impossible to stand upon the eminence on
which the travellers now found themselves; the
rain poured down in torrents, filling the ravines,
which but lately had appeared perfectly dry;
while the thunder rolled over their heads in one
tremendous roar. The sky was at the same time
enveloped in a darkness that would have been
total, had it not been interrupted by frequent
flashes of lightning, which only added horror to
the scene, by displaying the deep precipices on
one side of the road, and the impending crags on
the other.
It is impossible to describe the exasperating ef-
fect which the horrors of this scene produced upon
the mind of the wicked Hauteville. I forbear to
repeat his impious exclamations. His guide in-
treated him, for the love of God, to dismount and
wait patiently till the fury of the storm should be
overpast: but, madly determining to proceed, he
urged on his horse, saying, that the road was
surely wide enough for their passage; and using

expressions which I dare not repeat. So he
pushed furiously forwards, in the face of death
and eternal destruction.
In the midst of this mad career, a flash of light-
ning striking a tree on the right hand, drove it
suddenly across the road just before La Haute-
ville's horse, which, springing up on his hind legs,
plunged head foremost down a precipice on the
left hand.
Albert de la Hauteville for less than a moment
felt himself borne up over the immense precipice,
but what followed he knew not—a deep sleep, at-
tended with confused dreams, and accompanied
with dreadful pains and burning heats, occupied
a considerable interval—after which, he opened
his eyes, and his recollection was restored to
him.
He found himself lying on a bed in a very hum-
ble but neat apartment. A female of modest and
gentle deportment, sat working with her needle
by his bed-side, from time to time looking at
him with a careful and anxious countenance. A
venerable man sat by the fire-side, with a few
old books before him on a small table. There
was one window in the room, filled with glass
in small compartments, through which nothing
could be seen but trees. An outer door stood
wide open, admitting the fresh and balmy air,
which seemed to bear with it the smell of sweet

118 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
herbs; and a view of mountains, a few miles dis-
tant, was caught through this open door. Many
culinary utensils were neatly ranged round this
apartment, affording an idea of comfort and
cleanliness.
This was the scene which presented itself to
the eyes of Monsieur de la Hauteville, while as
yet he knew not whether he was still asleep or
awaking from a long dream—he felt himself how-
ever very weak, and disinclined to speak. He
looked round him again; and, at length, turning
his eyes towards the woman who sat by his bed,
she arose, and presented him something to drink,
which he gladly received, being parched with
thirst. As she put the cup down, she said, “He
drinks heartily—God bless it to him.” Her gen-
tle voice seemed to affect him; he tried to speak,
but found it impossible; and being immediately
again overcome with a temporary stupor, he re-
mained, he knew not how long, unconscious of
what passed. But after awhile, recovering him-
self again, he opened his eyes to the same scene;
with this variation, that the bright gilding of the
hills then indicated the evening hour.
Looking round him again he endeavoured to
recollect himself; and while his mind was thus
engaged, a young man, simply dressed, but of a
very beautiful and majestic appearance, entered
the house, and after addressing the inhabitants
thereof as his parents, they all three approached

the bed, where they stood looking upon the mi-
serable person who lay thereon.
The young man, with seeming earnestness, ad-
dressed several questions to his parents concern-
ing the state of the sick stranger; and then said,
in a solemn manner, “God grant to this unhappy
person time for repentance! How wonderful are
the dealings of the Almighty!” He then added,
“God is not to be deceived, whatever the hypo-
crite may suppose: He can judge through the
dark cloud.” (Job xxii. 13.)
“My son,” replied the old man, “let us hope
that this unhappy stranger has been spared as an
ensample of the mercy of God.” He then ad-
dressed himself to Monsieur Hauteville, and en-
quired after his health, saying, “Sir, you look
better: are you able to speak to us? Fear not;
you are surrounded by friends.”
Monsieur Hauteville made several ineffectual
efforts to speak connectedly. Upon which the
female before mentioned begged that he might be
left to himself till after she had given him food.
Monsieur de la Hauteville's recovery was slow
and much retarded by the anguish of his mind.
He perceived from the few words spoken by the
young man at his bed-side, that his character was
in part, if not wholly, known to those very persons,
by whose care, he doubted not, that his life had

been preserved. And now their disinterested
kindness to him, their holy deportment, the purity
of their discourse, and their strict observation of
religious duties, of which he was a daily witness—
all these were as coals of fire heaped on his head;
while his mind, as he became gradually convinced
of the purity of that religion which could produce
such beautiful fruit, was more and more torn with
the horrors of remorse.
By these painful feelings his recovery was great-
ly retarded: and at length when he became able to
speak, not knowing how to address the persons who
were about him, he preserved a mournful and sul-
len silence for a considerable length of time.
In this state of mind the unhappy Hauteville
continued, till the young man of whom I before
spoke undertook to expostulate with him. And
accordingly, one afternoon, his father and mother
having purposely gone out, he thus addressed
him: “Monsieur de la Hauteville,” said he, clos-
ing the door of the house, and approaching an
easy chair, into which Albert had that day been
removed, “it is time that we should enter into an
explanation of every circumstance connected with
our unexpected meeting in this place. My fa-
ther's name,” continued the young man, “is
Eugene Stephens. He is the pastor of a small
congregation among these mountains. My name
is Bartholomew; and I have been brought up
with a view, if God permit, to fill my excellent fa-

ther's place on earth, when he shall be removed
to a better world. Such,” added the young man,
“is our history: nor is your name unknown to
us, nor yet the motives which brought you into
these valleys—you betrayed yourself in the deli-
rium caused by that tremendous fall in which
your horse was destroyed. In that delirium you
uttered many words against the Most High; and
the Almighty at that time thoroughly removed
the thin mask of hypocrisy which you had assum-
ed for the deception and ruin of the inhabitants of
these valleys.
“Thus the Ruler of all things has stopped you
in the mad career of your crimes; he has brought
you down, and laid you low, in order, I trust, to
exalt you for ever. You have suffered greatly in
body, after being favoured with an almost mira-
culous escape. You are now no longer ignorant
of the nature of the faith of the Waldenses; since
the public confession of our faith was found in
your pocket. Moreover, in your travels among
us, you have had frequent opportunities of hear-
ing the unadulterated word of God; as well as in
this house, where the sacred Scriptures are daily
read in your hearing, and we anxiously hope not
, wholly without effect. If haply you become our
friend and a favourer of our religion, you will
probably be despised and rejected of men; for
we are not of the world, and the world loves us
not: but in that case God himself will stand
forth as your almighty friend, and your ever-

122 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
lasting protector—your past offences also will be
blotted out by the blood of Christ, who made a
full atonement for your sins by offering himself
up once for all upon the cross.”
Here the young pastor paused a moment, per-
ceiving that Monsieur Hauteville was greatly af-
fected. His earnest and open manner of address
had, with God's blessing, touched the heart of
this unhappy young man, who thus replied: “O
my friend!—if such a wretch as I am may pre-
sume to address you by that endearing title,_
how shall I dare to look up to you or to your
respectable parents? or how is it possible for me
to hope that such offences as mine can ever be
forgiven; committed as they have been, at once,
against God, and against those whom I now know
to be his persecuted children?”
“The blood of Jesus Christ,” replied the
younger Stephens, “cleanseth from all sin. Pray
then for those gracious and effectual operations
of the Holy Ghost, which alone can illuminate our
souls, and lead them fully to rely on the mercy of
God, through the merits of Jesus Christ.” (See
Confession of Faith of the Waldenses.)
In reply to this, Monsieur Hauteville broke forth
into an agony of grief, representing to Bartholo-
mew the dreadful manner in which he had been
brought up; not only in utter ignorance of reli-
gion, but with the most sovereign contempt for

it, as well as in the indulgence of every evil pas-
sion. “Even,” added he, “could my last intended
offence against the inhabitants of these valleys—
could this grievous crime be forgiven, my whole
life has been spent in sin; my heart is totally
depraved, and my habits altogether polluted."
Then looking earnestly in the face of his compa-
nion, he added, “I have surely passed the utmost
limits of mercy.”
“Though your sins be red as scarlet,” replied
the young pastor, “believe in Christ the Saviour,
and they shall be white as wool. Know that
Christ the Saviour rejects none who apply to him.
He is the only true Redeemer and Intercessor;
and through his all-prevailing mediation the vilest
sinner has free access to the Father. Invoke
him therefore with a holy confidence; for he will
not reject you. Has he not already testified his
tender love towards you, by your late remarkable
preservation? Wherefore then should you call in
question his further good-will towards you?”
It would take up too much time, were I to re-
peat all the arguments used by the young pastor
of the Vaudois, to induce Albert de la Hauteville
to return right humbly unto God: it shall suffice
to say, that his arguments were not unattended
with a blessing.
When Eugene Stephens and his wife returned,
they found Monsieur de la Hauteville still hear-

kening attentively to their son, gazing earnestly on
his grave and interesting countenance, and exhibit-
ing marks of the deepest contrition. Then placing
themselves on each side of Monsieur de la Haute-
ville, and each of them taking one of his hands,
they expressed themselves towards him with all the
solicitude of tender parents, beseeching him to
have mercy upon his own immortal soul.
But, not to repeat all that passed between Al-
bert de la Hauteville and this pious family, this
only shall be added, that before Albert was able
to leave the peaceful dwelling of Eugene Stephens,
he became fully sensible, through God's blessing,
of the wickedness of his former life, and more es-
pecially of the heinous nature of the plan which
had been formed for the destruction of the holy
inhabitants of these valleys; and that he was
brought heartily to thank God for the accident
by which he had been stopped short in the midst
of his detestable undertaking. -
The pastor possessed several copies of the Scrip-
tures in the French language, which afforded Mon-
sieur de la Hauteville an opportunity of studying
them at his leisure. And being duly prepared for
such an exercise, by great affliction both of body
and mind, it was rendered peculiarly beneficial to
him; insomuch that old things passing away and
all things becoming new, he might now have tra-
velled through the valleys without need of guile
or concealment. And thus, through the all-con-

verting power of the Gospel, the lion was trans-
formed into a lamb.
As soon as Monsieur Hauteville had sufficiently
recovered from the effects of his fall, the elder
Stephens, one fine evening, led him out to look at
the spot where the accident had taken place. It
was not a hundred yards from the pastor's house,
and still nearer to his little church. In this very
spot was the grave of Monsieur de la Hauteville's
horse: the turf had not as yet grown over it.
Immediately above rose the hill, in a precipitous
elevation of many feet, interrupted only by a few
rock-plants. Albert knelt by the grave of his
horse, and, looking up, returned thanks to Al-
mighty God for his wonderful escape. Incon-
ceivable things passed in his mind; but his coun-
tenance indicated the strongest feelings of grati-
tude. After rising from his knees, he thus ad-
dressed himself to the venerable pastor, with many
tears—“O thou my more than father! how can I
ever repay the immense debt of gratitude I owe
thee? With God's help, I will return to Paris,
and in the face of all the enemies of the Vaudois I
will there bear witness to the purity of their lives:
after which I will publicly renounce the Roman
Catholic religion, and cast in my lot with the de-
spised and persecuted of the earth.”
As soon as Albert de la Hauteville was suffi-
ciently recovered to undertake the journey, which
was not indeed for some months after his fall, he

126 THE GOVERNESS; or, THE
returned to Paris; where God gave him strength
publicly to declare himself the friend of the Wau-
dois, and a convert to their religion: and though
disgrace and persecution followed this avowal, he
was enabled faithfully to persevere in the righteous
course he had chosen, even unto the end.
The last days of Albert de la Hauteville were
spent in a prison in Paris, into which he was
thrown under some false pretence, though, in re-
ality, on account of his religion. In these circum-
stances he evidenced the greatness of his faith, by
rejoicing in tribulation, and looking unto his end
with a hope full of immortality; not only satis-
fied, but thankful that he was counted worthy to
suffer shame for his Saviour's sake. And not long
before his death, he declared himself abundantly
happier in the gloomy recesses of his prison, than
he had been when enjoying all the dissolute plea-
sures of the capital.
Here Miss Jenny ceased reading, when all her
hearers sat some little time silent. At length she
said, “From this story, my dear companions, you
see the power and goodness of God in bringing
this sinful young man to the knowledge of himself
and of his gracious Saviour. Only imagine what
he must have felt, on finding himself in a state so
helpless in the house of one of those poor innocent
persons, whose ruin he had so artfully endeavour-
ed to compass!” Miss Jenny made several further
remarks upon this story, for which she was thank-

ed by her school-fellows: but Miss Lucy Sly was
the most sensibly touched with the character of
Albert, as art and cunning had formerly been the
chief characteristics of her own mind. So turn-
ing with blushes to her companions, she said, if
they were not weary at present of their arbour, she
would recount to them the history of her life.
The Description of Miss Lucy Sly.
MISS LUCY SLY was of the same age as Miss
Dolly Friendly, but shorter at least by half the
head; and had she not been in the habit of in-
dulging many evil passions, she might have been
thought pretty. She had a pair of fine black
eyes: but those eyes had an expression of cunning,
which at times gave them a very unpleasant ap-
pearance. It was however to be hoped that, as
religion acquired greater influence over her mind,”
her countenance would become more agreeable.
She had a high forehead, and very beautiful black
hair; but the habitual defect of temper above no-
ted, had so affected her mouth, as to give a very
unlovely expression to the lower part of her face.
There is nothing which so much disfigures any
face as the indulgence of evil passions: whereas,
a countenance expressing the graces of the Holy
Spirit is beautiful even in sickness, in old age, and
in death itself. But to return to Miss Lucy Sly,
who with the blessing of God, through the means

of Mrs. Teachum and Miss Jenny Peace, was now
in a way to acquire that beauty of holiness
which excels as much the mere beauty of feature
and complexion, as the glory of heaven surpasses
the twinkling of a candle.
The Life of Miss Lucy Sly.
“FROM the time that I was two years old,”
said Miss Lucy, “my mamma was so sickly, that
she was unable to take care of me herself, in con-
sequence of which I was left to the charge of a
governess, who, I suppose, had no religion, since
I do not know that she ever spoke to me upon the
subject. She did not seem to care what became
of me, provided that I gave her no trouble; for
she used to sit all day in the room appointed for
our use with her feet upon the fender and a book
in her hand. She took no trouble whatever to
make me good, and yet was very angry if any
one found fault with me. And whenever I had
done any mischief, she often used to say that it
was the footboy, and not Miss, that had done it:
nay, she would say it was the dog, or the cat, or
any thing she could lay the blame on, rather than
own me to be in fault; supposing, I imagine,
that some part of the blame falling upon me would
attach to herself.
“I was very well pleased at all this, and began
soon to think that I could never be in fault, sup-

posing myself indeed to be a very good girl: so
that I was very much surprised when I heard you,
Miss Jenny, and my governess, speak of me as
being a sinner; and I must own that I was at first
much offended at it. But to return to my story.
“All this time, while I thought myself so good
a girl, I constantly told lies, and laid all my faults
on others. I remember once, when I had broken
a fine china cup, that I artfully got out of the
scrape by hiding the cup in the footboy's room,
which brought upon him a severe correction. I
felt however neither shame nor remorse on this
account; and indeed I had almost forgotten it, till
I came here and received better instruction. But
since that time I have seen my past life in a very
different point of view, and do feel myself at pre-
sent to be a very great sinner. -
“This custom of endeavouring to deceive,” con-
tinued Miss Lucy Sly, “I led till I came to school;
where I soon discovered that I could not so well
carry on my wicked schemes; since our good go-
verness was not so easy to be imposed upon as
my relations at home. Neither would any of my
school-fellows submit to be punished wrongfully
for my sake, as the poor footboy had often unhap-
pily been. These things at first made me very
angry indeed; though I now wonder at my folly
herein. This is all I know of my life hitherto;
and I am truly sorry and ashamed that I have no
better an account of myself to lay before you.”

Thus ended Miss Lucy Sly; when Miss Jenny
Peace said, “My dear friend, you have great
cause to give thanks to Almighty God, who has
produced in you the first blessed work of the Holy
Spirit, in giving you a sense of the great wicked-
ness of your past life. We are naturally dead in
sin, and our consciences are so dull and hard, that
we go on committing the most grievous offences,
without being in the least sensible of them. But
when the sweet influences of the Holy Spirit reach
the heart, we then become sensible of our sins,
our consciences are made tender, and we are hum-
bled both before God and our fellow-creatures. I
doubt not, my dear Miss Lucy, that you are now
sincerely grieved to think of your injustice towards
the poor footboy, and that you are anxious, in
some way or other, to make up for your evil treat-
ment of him.”
“Indeed,” replied Miss Lucy, “I would do so
if I could; and it would afford me pleasure if you
could point out to me some proper method of
making him reparation.”
“The way, my dear,” said Miss Jenny, “is very
plain: you have nothing to do but, on writing next
to your mamma, to confess your faults respecting
him.”
Miss Lucy coloured, and the tears came into
her eyes: but, after a moment's hesitation, she
said, “I will, Miss Jenny, with God's help, follow

your advice; although, I own, it will put me to
extraordinary pain. I thank God I see my duty,
and I will pray for help to perform it.”
Miss Jenny put her arms round Miss Lucy's
neck, and kissed her tenderly, while they mingled
their tears together. All the rest of the little
party were much affected with this proof of true
penitence; and they were still shedding tears of
joy when the bell summoned them to supper:
soon after which they retired to rest.

TU E SDAY,
The fifth Day.
OUR little company, as soon as the morning
school-hours were over, hastened to their arbour,
attentively expecting what Miss Jenny Peace would
propose to them for their amusement till dinner-
time; when Miss Jenny taking out of her pocket
a little gilt book, said, if they pleased, she would
read them another short story, which, if they had
not met with before, she had no doubt would af-
ford them pleasure.
They all eagerly asked the title of the story; to
which Miss Jenny replied, “It is the history of the
hard-hearted little girl.”
The young ladies all assured Miss Jenny that
they had never heard of the book before; upon
which she immediately began to read.
The History of Miss Fanny; or, the hard-hearted
little Girl.
IN a small sea-port town, or rather village, in

the north-west of England, there formerly lived
a very respectable widow lady, named Hill, who
having two daughters, endeavoured to bring them
up in the fear of God, and in useful habits.
The eldest of these was married while young to
a gentleman of the name of King, and was so un-
fortunate as in a very few years to lose her hus-
band and two sons. One little girl only remained
to her, with whom she returned to her mother's
house, devoting the remainder of her days to the
service of her God, to her aged mother, and to
this little daughter, who was still in a state of
infancy on her father's removal. What time this
excellent woman could spare from these her first
duties, she consecrated to the poor: and thus hap-
pily employing her hours, she found that consola-
tion, which the active performance of duty seldom
fails to afford in affliction.
The name of Mrs. King's little daughter was
Anna; and the discreet manner in which she was
educated soon shewed itself in her gentle and ami-
able deportment, as well as in the sweet expression
of her countenance.
Mrs. Hill's second daughter was married a few
years after her sister to the captain of a merchant
vessel, whose family resided in the same village; a
man of rough manners, and not altogether pleasing
to the old lady: but as her daughter's mind was
set upon the connection, Mrs. Hill had not thought
N


## p. 134 (#146) ############################################

134 THE GOVERN ESS; OR, THE
it right to control her inclinations any further than
by expressing her disapprobation, and giving her
reasons for so doing. And this indeed ought to
have been sufficient to make the young lady hesi-
tate, if not entirely to lay aside all thoughts of the
marriage.
The captain's name was Saunders. He possessed
a handsome house in the village, not far from Mrs.
Hill's neat little dwelling; and as he was frequent-
ly from home for months together, it might have
been a great comfort to Mrs. Saunders to be so
near her mother and sister.
Mrs. Saunders had, like her sister, one little
girl, who, being about the age of her cousin,
would have been a very pleasant and proper com-
panion for her, had they been educated upon the
same plan. But whereas Anna was brought up,
as we before said, in the most unexceptionable
manner; little Fanny Saunders was seldom sub-
jected to any control: in consequence of which,
she became from day to day more selfish and more
obstinate. For such is the depravity of our na-
ture, that it is not sufficient to remove children
from the view of actual evil; but they must be
persuaded and compelled to do well by every in-
ducement that can be held forth to them for that
purpose.
We may suppose that Mrs. Hill, when she saw
the difference between her two little grandchildren,


## p. 135 (#147) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 135
did not spare expostulation with her younger
daughter on the occasion; neither can we believe
that Mrs. King, who was so very anxious to bring
up her own child properly, could refrain from
speaking freely to her sister upon the subject.
But whatever arguments they might use, they pro-
duced no effect upon the conduct of Mrs. Saun-
ders. She was too partial to her daughter to
dwell much upon her faults, always speaking of
her as of a mere baby, who would do better as she
grew older. In vain the grandmother would say,
“If you wish your child to behave well in youth,
you must compel her to do so as an infant; and if
you desire her to be a pious woman, you must
endeavour to make her a pious child: that is, the
means appointed by God must be employed, in
order to secure so desirable an (nd. And though
the best means which we can use,” this pious old
lady would add, “must of themselves fall far
short of the proposed end; since no parent can
so far change the heart of a child, as to inspire it
either with divine love or with self-abhorrence;
the parent is nevertheless bound to do all in his
power to effect this mighty work, looking up in
faith for the blessing of God on his endeavours.”
The only effect which Mrs. Hill's expostulations
produced upon her daughter was this, that instead
of controlling Fanny, she endeavoured to hide the
child's faults from its grandmother and aunt: and,
in consequence, she seldom brought her to see
them, or to play with her cousin. But when she

136 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
herself visited the old lady, she generally left
Fanny with the servants, who, in order to please
their mistress, allowed the child every possible
indulgence; thus fostering and confirming all
those evil habits which, in better company, would
at least have been weakened, if not overcome.
Thus do over fond parents, in ways innumerable,
promote the ruin of their children.
In this manner Fanny and Anna attained each
her eighth year, for there were only a few months
difference in their ages, Fanny being the elder.
At this time Mrs. Hill, who was very old, began
rapidly to decay; and at length, taking entirely
to her bed, her physicians declared it as their
opinion that she could not live many weeks.
Captain Saunders being at this time from home,
Mrs. Saunders, anxious to assist her sister in at-
tending on their sick parent, became for a season
an inmate in her mother's house, accompanied
by her little daughter. And now the difference
between the two children, who were brought con-
tinually together, (both bearing the same relation
to the dying person,) was made strikingly appa-
rent even to the most common observer, who could
hardly fail to mark in little Anna the lovely effects
of a pious education.
While the poor old lady lay on her death-bed,
this amiable child of her own accord put away all
her dolls and playthings, not allowing herself to

touch one of them. And instead of running and
jumping up and down stairs, as she had always
been accustomed to do, she crept about like a
little mouse, never speaking but in a whisper. If
she had anything more than ordinary given her to
eat, she would carry it softly to her grandmother's
bed-side, and place it on the little table by her.
And when the servants or nurses were called away,
she could be trusted to sit in the room and watch
her grandmamma; never expressing any weariness
if this kind of attention was required of her for
hours together. A thousand little tokens of regard
she shewed her dying grandmother, which cannot
here be mentioned; not performed in a bustling
or ostentatious manner, as if she was doing some
very great work, but with an apparent conscious-
ness that she was doing no more than her duty.
And indeed how can any child, even the best of
children, ever sufficiently repay a kind parent's
tenderness and care?
But how greatly did the behaviour of the giddy
and selfish Fanny differ from that of her little cou-
sin! Any person not knowing the tendency of a
religious education to soften the heart and refine
the feelings, would have said that Anna was na-
turally a very tender-hearted little girl, and Fanny
a very hard-hearted one; a remark that was indeed
often actually made both by the servants and
other occasional observers. But such remarks are
contrary to the general tenor of Scripture, which
describes the heart of man as naturally producing

138 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
no good thing, asserting that as in water face
answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
(Prov. xxvii. 19.) Accordingly, we may venture
to assert, that the difference between the two
cousins was not a natural one, but the effect of
divine grace operating upon the heart.
While her grandmamma lay in a dying state,
Fanny never put any restraint whatever upon her-
self, nor indeed seemed to think such self-denial
at all necessary. She ran up and down stairs,
jumping and singing, or swinging down the banis-
ters, as usual; and if dismissed from the parlour,
where her loud voice continually disturbed the
old lady, whose bed-room was on the same floor,
she would go and romp in the kitchen. And so
far was she from denying herself any delicate
morsel which she thought might be gratifying to
her grandmother, that if she saw any jelly or other
nice thing prepared for the poor sick person, she
would, if she had an opportunity, take part of it
slily; or indeed the whole, if not interrupted.
It was impossible for Mrs. King to see all this
ill behaviour of her niece without speaking to her
sister upon the subject; although she had expos-
tulated with Mrs. Saunders so often in vain upon
the state of her child, as to leave her but little
hope of saying anything that might be service-
able.
“Do not, my dear sister,” she one day said,


## p. 139 (#151) ############################################

“allow your beloved child to indulge herself in
such unfeeling habits.”
“Unfeeling!” retorted Mrs. Saunders; “do not
use so harsh a word, sister. The child is only
giddy and thoughtless; she does not mean to be
unfeeling.”
“My dear sister,” answered Mrs. King, “whe-
ther we hurt a fellow-creature from thoughtless-
ness or from intention, it comes to much the same
thing, as far as the injured person is concerned.
But what is the thoughtlessness you speak of, but
want of feeling? All children naturally want feel-
ing; and they should be made to feel, and to suf-
fer punishment, whenever they transgress in these
points.”
“Sister,” returned Mrs. Saunders, “you do not
consider that Fanny is but a child.”
“This therefore is the special season for making
her what you wish,” replied Mrs. King; “now is
your time, with God's help, to bend her will.”
“Sister,” answered Mrs. Saunders, “I cannot
see these things in the serious light in which you
consider them.”
“But you will see them so hereafter, my dear
sister,” replied Mrs. King; “and God grant you
may not also feel, in your own case, that you have

done wrong in allowing your child to act thus
unfeelingly.” Mrs. King would have said more;
but perceiving that her sister's anger was rising,
she thought it better to refrain.
After a few days' illness, poor Mrs. Hill died.
Her spirit departed during the night; and on the
following morning when the family assembled in
the breakfast-room, most of them appeared to be
solemnly impressed with the scene which they had
witnessed. The little girls had not been present
when the old lady died, but they had both been
informed of the event; and when they came down
to breakfast, Anna's eyes were swelled with cry-
ing. She endeavoured however to appear com-
posed, observing that her mamma tried to do the
Sanne.
Breakfast was brought in, and the family sat
down round the table; but neither of the elder
ladies seemed inclined to eat. Little Anna had
been used to breakfast on milk, and for some few
years it had been her custom to skim the cream
from her bason of milk, and put it into a little
cream-jug, which belonged to her doll's tea-equi-
page, for her grandmamma's use. From the force
of habit she this day, as usual, began to skim
the milk; when suddenly recollecting herself, she
burst into such an agony of tears, as quite alarm-
ed her mamma. “My dear,” said Mrs. King,
“what is the matter? do endeavour to com-
pose yourself. Recollect your dear grandmamma

is happy, happier than she was yesterday—her
troubles are now all over. She is assuredly hap-
py, because she knew that her Redeemer was
mighty, and she trusted her cause in his hands.”
(Prov. xxiii. 11.) -
“But Oh, mamma!” said Anna, leaving the
table, and putting her arms round her mother's
neck, “I cannot help crying. Pray, forgive me;
I tried not to do it.”
Mrs. King took her little girl in her lap, and
for some moments continued to mingle her tears
with those of the child; neither could Mrs. Saun-
ders refrain from weeping at this scene. But in
the mean time Fanny continued to eat her break-
fast as if nothing affecting had happened, and
even availed herself of the general confusion to
help herself to what she liked best at the ta-
ble.
Lest however I should lengthen this story be-
yond the limits of a book within the reach of a
little one's purse, I shall not enter into every par-
ticular of the children's behaviour, either during
the interval, or at the funeral: suffice it to say,
that from first to last Anna behaved with the
same unobtrusive tenderness, and Fanny with the
same thoughtless insensibility.
After the funeral, Mrs. Saunders returned to
her own house, leaving Mrs. King with her dear

little daughter in the dwelling of her departed
mother. And from that time Mrs. King devoted
herself entirely to the education of Anna, who
improved from year to year, continually becoming
more and more dear to her mother.
In the mean time Mrs. Saunders and Fanny
went on in their old way. Fanny grew older,
but there was no improvement observable in her
character; she was the same giddy, thoughtless,
selfish girl at twelve years of age, as she had
been at seven, still experiencing the same indis-
creet and cruel indulgence from her mother.
Mrs. King had long ceased to expostulate with
her sister, but she never ceased to pray for her.
This duty she performed daily; and whenever she
had an opportunity of being alone with her niece,
she reminded her, that her mother's fondness was
far from being an excuse for her unfeeling and
careless conduct. She represented to her, that
she was now of an age to discern between good
and evil, and that God would certainly take ac-
count of her behaviour towards her indulgent pa-
rent. Fanny however paid no attention to her
aunt, but rather avoided her society, as well as
that of her cousin.
At length the time of Fanny's punishment ar-
rived. Mrs. Saunders suddenly fell into a very
bad state of health, and became so helpless, as
to require the most constant and tender atten-

tion. Her husband was seldom at home, and she
soon found it a vain thing to expect any comfort
from her daughter. On this occasion she re-
membered with anguish the scenes which had
taken place at her own mother's death, and bit-
terly repented having indulged her child at such
a time in that unfeeling thoughtlessness, which had
now settled into a habit of decided cruelty. She
was unwilling to apply for help to her sister, be-
cause she had for some years past neglected that
dear relative, or at least treated her with great
coldness. Mrs. King however no sooner under-
stood the situation of Mrs. Saunders, than she
came to offer her own services, and those of her
daughter; both of which the poor sick woman
most gladly accepted.
And now when Mrs. Saunders came to find
in her niece not only a sweet companion, but a
patient and gentle nurse, and one in whom she
could entirely confide, she became more deeply
sensible of the blameable part she had acted to-
wards her own child, and manifested, too late, a
wish to repair her former errors. But whatever
she now said to Fanny, the selfish girl attributed
it to her mother's low spirits proceeding from her
disease; and this made her more anxious than
ever to avoid the sick chamber.
It is not easy to describe poor Mrs. Saunders's
feelings on being thus wholly neglected by her
daughter; it may be sufficient to say, that the

144 THE GOVERNEss; or, THE
anguish of her mind was supposed very materially
to hasten her death. She died deeply lamenting
the indiscretion of her conduct towards her child,
and humbly imploring forgiveness for this and all
her sins, through her Saviour's merits. Her last
days on earth were full of bitterness; yet we
trust there was hope in her end, since she died.
self-condemned, and relying alone upon an all-
powerful Redeemer. Her husband returned home
only a few hours before her departure; yet in time
to receive her last request, which was, that he
would place their daughter entirely under the
charge of her sister.
Mrs. King, who was present when her dying
sister made this her last request, and who took
that occasion to assure the captain of her perfect
willingness to undertake the charge of his daugh-
ter, was sorry to perceive that he made his wife
no promise of the kind; she therefore judged,
what afterwards proved to be the case, that he
had other plans for his child.
It was easy to see that Fanny felt very little
sorrow at the death of her mother, although she
was come to an age when people in general have
address enough to hide from the world their want
of feeling. She did not therefore quite betray
the hardness of her heart, on this occasion, to
any one except her aunt, who was too quick-
sighted to be deceived by the slight appearance
of sorrow which she endeavoured to assume.

As soon as the funeral was over, Mrs. King
prepared to return to her own house; and as the
captain was going on another voyage, she took this
opportunity of telling him, that she was now ready
to receive her dear sister's child into her family.
In answer to this, he replied, that he himself
had a sister living at Canterbury, who was a wi-
dow, and who had a large fortune at her own dis-
posal: that she had offered to take Fanny; and
that as he himself had not much to give her, he
thought he should be injuring his daughter's pros-
pects very much if he rejected his sister's offer.
Mrs. King answered, that she hoped he would
not on this occasion consider fortune only, but
also consult the good of his child in other points
of view, and not trust her to the care of his sister,
unless he thought her a person capable of direct-
ing and improving a young girl.
To this he answered, that he desired to be left
to the management of his own affairs, that his
mind was made up on the subject, and that he
intended to take his daughter with him into the
south whét, he made his next voyage.
Mrs. King was much hurt, having formerly
known this sister of Captain Saunders, who was
at that time remarkable for nothing but an ex-
ceedingly violent temper, by which, when living
in her father's house, she had rendered herself
O

146 THE GOVERN ESS; or, THE
universally disagreeable. She found it however
in vain to argue the point with the captain. So
in a few days she was obliged to take leave of
her niece, who accompanied her father on board
his ship, and landed with him, after a short voy-
age, at Gravesend, which is on the river Thames,
a little below London; from whence passing over
land to Canterbury, she was put under the charge
of her father's sister.
After the departure of Fanny and her father,
Mrs. King returned with her daughter to her own
small house, in which she continued to live till
her daughter's marriage, which took place when
Anna was four-and-twenty years of age.
The person who married Miss King was a
young and pious clergyman, whose affectionate
regards had been excited and fixed by the amia-
ble qualities of Anna; for indeed her fortune was
very small, and she possessed but a moderate
share of any other kind of beauty, except that
which proceeds from a lovely mind inhabiting a
young and healthy body. This worthy gentle-
man insisted upon Mrs. King's leaving her small
house, and becoming an inmate of their: where
this happy little family continued to dwell together
in the utmost harmony, till separated by death.
Mrs. King lived to see herself the grandmother
of four children, two boys and as many girls, in
the care and education of whom she was, by God's

blessing, enabled to take an active part for many
years.
In the mean time Fanny, being placed under the
care of her aunt, Mrs. Boswell, at Canterbury, be-
gan to feel what it was to be subject to the violence
and caprices of an ill-tempered and irreligious wo-
man. She at first endeavoured to repel ill-humour
by carelessness and the same kind of obstinacy
which she had shewn towards her too indulgent
mother: but Mrs. Boswell soon let her know, that
this kind of conduct would not do with her. Mrs.
Boswell would not only be obeyed, but humoured
in every whim; and Fanny could scarcely obtain
the common necessaries of life without shewing
her the utmost submission. Fanny complained,
by letter, to her father; but she received, in an-
swer, a command to submit implicitly to her aunt's
will: for looking forward to Mrs. Boswell's large
fortune, Captain Saunders felt that every thing else
ought to give way to so important a consideration.
Thus left without resource, Fanny became a
complete slave to her capricious aunt, who used
to keep her all the morning labouring with her
needle, and employed her all the evening to make
a fourth for the card-table, at which Mrs. Boswell
regularly spent the last four or five hours of the
day. Fanny was never allowed to walk out, ex-
cepting with Mrs. Boswell, who once or twice in
a month spent a whole morning in paying visits
among her old neighbours; on which occasions


## p. 148 (#160) ############################################

148 THE GOVERNEss; or, The
Fanny was never suffered to speak. In addition
to these employments, Fanny was required to at-
tend Mrs. Boswell's parrot, to comb and wash
the lap-dog, to feed the cats, and to hear all the
tittle-tattle and scandal of the town.
In this dull manner year passed after year,
without improvement and without pleasure, while
Fanny's health and spirits were visibly on the de-
cline: and though she did not dare, as formerly,
to give open indulgence to her ill-humour, yet in
such circumstances she naturally became a prey
to inward discontent.
Now she remembered her mother's neglected
kindness, with deep regret; and very gladly would
she have called back the days that were past: but
being utterly destitute of religious principles, her
sorrow did not work for her good. She consider-
ed herself as injured and miserable, but it never
entered into her head that she was also sinful, and
that the afflictions which she then endured were
the just punishment of her former undutiful be-
haviour. Neither did it occur to her, (or if the
thought ever presented itself, it was immediately
rejected,) that if she now suffered, it was for her
good, and in order that she might be thereby
eternally benefited. She had never been taught
this consolatory piece of knowledge—that God
does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children
of men; but though he cause grief, yet will he
have compassion according to the multitude of his

mercies. She therefore gave not her cheek to him
that smote her, neither was full of self-reproach.
(Lament. iii.) Accordingly, instead of profiting
by her afflictions, they produced upon her mind
no other than an irritating effect.
In this state she continued till she had nearly
reached the age of thirty; when her father died,
leaving her only a few hundred pounds, which was
all the property he possessed at his death. She
had now reached that time of life when people
who have little or no religion begin to think more
of the value of money than they do in earlier
days. And as Mrs. Boswell was then very old,
she thought that, after having suffered so much
from her for so many years, it might be prudent
to hold out a little longer, in order to secure the
possession of her fortune; fully assured that, if
she should discover the least disposition to leave
her, that prospect could never be realized.
Agreeably to this idea, after her father's death,
Fanny still continued to live with Mrs. Boswell,
and to bear with all her whims; which, as she
grew older and more infirm, became more and
more intolerable. Contrary however to Fanny's
expectation, Mrs. Boswell outlived Captain Saun-
ders ten years; so that Fanny was nearly forty
years of age when she died.

to expect, on opening the old lady's will, it was
found that she had left every thing to certain
distant relations of her husband, excepting two
hundred pounds, which with her old clothes were
bequeathed to Fanny.
This bitter disappointment was almost more
than Fanny could bear, since her heart was now
wholly set upon money. She collected therefore
her little property together, and retiring to a small
lodging in a dark old street of Canterbury, where
none of her former acquaintance were likely to
meet with her, she spent the remainder of life
in lamenting and mourning over her disappoint-
ment; her only amusement being that of playing
at cards with some old persons of humble fortune
who lodged in the same house.
Even in this situation, poor and unknown as she
was, Fanny might still have been happy, had she
turned her thoughts from herself and her own feel-
ings to God, endeavouring in the mean time to do
some little good to those about her; for there is no
one too poor to find opportunities of usefulness:
but the same selfish feelings which she had indulg-
ed from her very childhood, accompanied her
to her last hours. Her own troubles, her own
disappointments, her own health, her own little
aches and pains, in short, all and every thing be-
longing to herself, was of the first importance; so
that her own concerns left no room in her heart
for the concerns either of God or her neighbour.

Mrs. King had died about the time of Mrs.
Boswell's death: but her daughter Anna was not
unmindful of her cousin. On hearing of her dis-
appointment, she wrote kindly to her, begging
that she would come and spend her days near
her, promising to assist her by every means in
her power, and sending her five guineas at the
same time to pay for her journey. But Fanny,
although she did not refuse to receive the money,
yet entertaining some secret suspicion that her
cousin would triumph over her in her fallen
state, refused her friendly invitation. And thus
she condemned herself to finish her days among
strangers, where no one loved or cared for
her.
Anna was grieved at her refusal; nevertheless,
she made a point of sending her the same sum
every year, although, in order to do this without
robbing her own family, which was not in very af-
fluent circumstances, she wore many a threadbare
gown, with many a shabby cap or hood. Her
little presents to her cousin were always accom-
panied with some sweet letter of advice, earnest-
ly requesting her to seek comfort where alone it
could be found, even in the bosom of him who
bore our griefs and carried our sorrows. But poor
Fanny, instead of paying any heed to Anna's coun-
sels, took her kind letters rather as so many in-
sulting proofs of her cousin's fancied superiority:
and so deeply rooted were her feelings of this
kind, that nothing could eradicate them.

In this manner her life passed away without
satisfaction; till, as she had lived only for her-
self, she died, at an advanced age, unlamented
by any human creature. Thus Fanny closed her
wretched days, an awful example to all those who
through life are in the habit of considering Self
only: for Self is a miserable comforter and a weak
support at that hour, when nature sinks under
the weight of its own infirmities, and when all
the merit of man's very best actions must be cast
away as filthy rags, in which the saint dares not
appear before a pure and holy God.
When Miss Jenny had ceased reading, Miss
Patty Locket remarked, that she had never till
lately been taught that loving Self was a sin. “I
always supposed,” said she, “that every body
loved themselves, and preferred themselves to all
the world beside; and that as it was natural so to
do, there could be no harm in it.”
“Why, my dear,” replied Miss Jenny, “we do,
as you say, naturally love ourselves, and seek to
promote our own pleasure at the expence of every
one else: but we are taught by the Holy Spirit
of God, that many things which proceed out of
the heart of the natural man are grossly wicked,
and that the heart itself must be changed before
we can enter into the kingdom of heaven. Re-
ligion requires that we should not prefer ourselves
to others, but rather give up our own satisfactions
to advance the happiness of our neighbours: and

our blessed Saviour has set before us a glorious
example of self-denial, in this respect; such as
we may indeed admire at a distance, but can
never perfectly imitate. And it is very certain,
my dear Miss Patty, that those persons who are
willing to be thought of little consequence in this
world, while they are truly anxious to do good to
others, are abundantly the most happy.”
“Indeed,” replied Miss Patty Locket, “I be-
lieve what you say to be very true, Miss Jenny;
for since I have ceased to think so much of my-
self as I used to do, and have endeavoured, with
God's help, to love my school-fellows more, and
to make them happy, I have found myself much
more contented than I formerly was.”
In answer to this remark, Miss Jenny requested
Miss Patty, if it was not disagreeable to her, and
as it was now her turn, to relate what she could
remember of her past life; with which request she
instantly complied.
The Description of Miss Patty Locket.
Miss PATTY LocKET was but eleven years old,
tall, and inclined to be fat. When she was in
good humour her countenance was very agree-
able, and, like the rest of her little companions,
she had greatly improved in her appearance, since
she had been engaged, by the blessing of God,

in combating her evil passions. For it is certain,
as has been remarked before, that nothing deforms
the human face so entirely as the indulgence of
any evil passion. Agreeably to this observation,
since her mind had been better regulated, Miss
Patty Locket had acquired a composure of man-
ner and countenance which was extremely pleas-
ing: and as she was fair, healthy, and spright-
ly, no one could look upon her now without
satisfaction; whereas, formerly she had been
generally considered as a sulky, disagreeable
girl.
Such was Miss Patty Locket, who was now to
give a relation of her past life, which she did in the
following manner.
The Life of Miss Patty Locket.
“I LiveD till I was six years of age in a very
large family; having four sisters and three bro-
thers, all older than myself. We played together,
and passed our time much in the common way;
sometimes quarrelling, and sometimes agreeing,
just as chance would have it. Our parents shewed
no particular partiality to any of us, so that we
had no cause to envy one another on that account:
but while we lived tolerably well together, I can-
not say that anything like real love existed among
us; nor indeed at that time had I any just notion
of such a state.


## p. 155 (#167) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 155
“When I was six years old, my grandmother
by my father's side, who was also my godmother,
offering to take me to live with her, and pro-
mising to look upon me as her own child, and
entirely to provide for me, my father and mother,
considering their large family, very readily accept-
ed her offer, and sent me directly to her house.
“About half a year before this she had taken
another grandchild, the daughter of my aunt Brad-
ley, then lately dead, and whose husband was gone
to the West Indies. My cousin Molly Bradley was
four years older than myself; and her poor mother
had taken such pains with her education, that she
understood more than most girls of her age. In
addition to which, she possessed so much liveliness,
good-humour, and cleverness, that every body be-
came fond of her; insomuch that whenever I went
out in company with her, while every one noticed
my cousin, I was totally disregarded.
“Though I had all my life before lived in a fa-
mily where every one in it was older and of more
consequence than myself, yet I never remember,
while in my father's house, being much troubled
with jealous or envious thoughts; for being ge-
nerally together in the nursery, nobody took much
notice of any of us, or praised one of us more
than another. But now, living in the house with
only one companion, who was so much more ad-
mired than myself, this marked distinction began
not only to vex me, but even to excite a strong


## p. 156 (#168) ############################################

156 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
hatred and aversion in my mind towards my cou-
sin; while I never thought of blaming myself, or
of resisting these odious feelings. I knew nothing
of the wickedness of my heart at that time; since
nobody had ever taken the trouble to explain this
to me. And though I read the Bible every day
to my grandmother, yet I never understood it; for
so as I could make out the words rightly, and keep
the proper stops, nothing more was ever required
of me. And yet, bad as my heart was, I believe
that I should not have hated my cousin so much,
nor have refused to learn those things from her
which she kindly offered to teach me, if it had not
been for Betty, the maid who dressed us. She used
to be continually talking to me about the prefer-
ence which was given to my cousin, and would
often say, ‘I wonder, Miss Patty, how you can
bear to see Miss Molly so much preferred before
you! and how you can bear to be taught by her 1
Why, she is almost as much of a child as you are.’
“This discourse of the servant's so much in-
creased my discontent, that I used to say to my
oousin, when she offered to teach me, that I was
not put under her care, but under that of my
grandmother; not considering that my poor
grandmother was too old and infirm to do much
towards my education, although she took care
that I should want neither food nor clothes.
“In this manner I lived, fretting, and vexing,
and depriving myself, by my ill-temper, of all

means of improvement; till at length my grand-
mamma was advised to send me to school. But
though I left my cousin, I did not leave my wick-
ed heart behind me. My ill-tempers followed me
even to this place, and I should surely have been
as miserable here as I was at my grandmother's,
if my kind governess, and you, Miss Jenny, had
not taken pains to shew me the wickedness of my
heart; and had I not been led, by God's mercy,
to seek help from the Holy Spirit to overcome my
wicked tempers.”
Here Miss Patty Locket ceased, and the dinner-
bell called them from the arbour.
After they had dined, Mrs. Teachum told them,
she thought it proper that they should use some
exercise in the cooler part of the day, lest, by sit-
ting too much, they should injure their health.
As soon as the children understood their gover-
ness's pleasure, they readily and joyfully prepar-
ed to obey her commands, requesting that they
might be permitted, after school, to take a walk
as far as the dairy-house, to eat curds and cream.
Mrs. Teachum not only granted their request,
but said she would dispense with their school-
attendance that afternoon, in order to give them
more time for their walk, which would extend
to between two and three miles; she likewise
added, that she herself would accompany them.
P


## p. 158 (#170) ############################################

158 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
At this they all flew like lightning to get them-
selves ready for their walk, and soon with cheer-
ful countenances attended Mrs. Teachum in the
school-room.
This good gentlewoman was so far from laying
them under any restraint in their walk by her
presence, that she encouraged them to run in the
fields, and to gather flowers; which they accord-
ingly did, each little Miss trying to get the pret-
tiest flower to present to her governess. In this
agreeable manner, they arrived at the dairy-house
before they imagined they had walked a mile.
There lived at this dairy-house an old woman
nearly seventy years of age. She had a fresh co-
lour in her face, but was troubled with the palsy,
which caused her head to shake. She seemed
to bend under a weight of infirmity, and her hair
was become quite grey; but retaining much good-
humour, she received the young party with a
hearty welcome. The little people flocked about
this good woman, asking her a thousand ques-
tions; and Miss Polly Suckling was so silly as
to ask her why she shook her head so, and what
made her hair so white.
Miss Jenny Peace hearing this, and being afraid
lest they should say something which might offend
the old lady, begged them not to talk so fast.
“O! let the dear rogues alone,” said the old

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 159
woman, “I like their prattle:” and, taking Miss
Polly by the hand, she added, “Come, my dear,
we will go to the dairy, and skim the milk.” At
these words they all ran into the dairy, and being
in high spirits, some of them were so rude as to
dip their fingers in the cream; which when Mrs.
Nelly perceived, who was the eldest daughter of
the old woman, and managed all the affairs of the
dairy, she requested them all to walk out of the
dairy, saying, that she would bring them what
was fit for them: upon which, Miss Dolly Friend-
ly reddened with anger, and was going to an-
swer; but Miss Jenny Peace checked her.
The old woman now caused the little company
to sit down at a long table, which she soon sup-
plied with plenty of cream, strawberries, brown
bread, and sugar.
Mrs. Teachum took her place at the upper end
of the table, while the young people sat down in
their usual order, to partake of the good things
provided for them; being first reminded by their
excellent governess to give thanks. After which
Mrs. Teachum told them that they might walk
into the garden and orchard; when it would be
time to return home.
The good old woman shewed them the way
into the garden, and gathering the finest roses
and pinks she could pick, she gave them to Miss
Polly, for whom she had taken a great fancy.


## p. 160 (#172) ############################################

160 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
Before they departed, Mrs. Teachum rewarded
the old woman for her trouble; who, on her part,
expressed much pleasure in having seen so many
well-behaved young ladies, and said she hoped
that they would often repeat their visit.
These little friends had not walked far in their
way home before they met a miserable ragged
man, who begged their charity. The little girls
immediately gathered about this poor creature,
and were hearkening with great compassion to
his story, when Mrs. Teachum came up to them;
who was not a little pleased to perceive all her
scholars with their hands in their pockets, whence
they speedily distributed some sixpences and se-
veral halfpence. She took occasion however to
point out to them, after the poor man was gone,
that in general alms were more usefully bestowed
upon such poor persons as live in the neighbour-
hood, and are known, than upon those who go
begging about the country.
The little party got home about nine o'clock;
but, late as it was, they did not forget to return
thanks to the Giver of all good things for the
variety of pleasures which they had that day
enjoyed.

W E D N E S D A Y,
The sixth Day.
THIS morning the little society were so entirely
engaged with their school-duties and their masters,
that they had no opportunity of assembling in the
beloved arbour before dinner: and after school-
hours in the afternoon, two young ladies, Lady
Caroline and Lady Fanny Delun, who had for-
merly known Miss Jenny Peace, and who were at
present in that neighbourhood, came to make her
a visit.
Lady Caroline was sixteen years of age, tall
and genteel in her person, of a fair complexion,
and possessing a regular set of features; so that
upon the whole she was generally complimented
as being very handsome: but her sister, Lady
Fanny, had not the least pretensions to beauty.
It was but lately that their father had, by the
death of a distant relation, become Earl of Delun;
so that they had not long been addressed by the
title usually given to noblemen's daughters.
Miss Jenny Peace received them as old acquaint-

ance: not neglecting however the respect due to
their quality. The young ladies drank tea with
Miss Jenny in Mrs. Teachum's parlour. After
which Mrs. Teachum allowed Miss Jenny to in-
troduce her school-fellows to her visitors; on
which occasion all her little companions were
brought into their governess's parlour, and per-
mitted to spend an hour there.
But to describe the behaviour of Miss Jenny
Peace's visitors, is no easy matter. Lady Caro-
line, who was dressed in a pink robe, embroider-
ed thick with gold, adorned with brilliant jewels
and the finest Mechlin lace, addressed much of
her discourse to her sister, in order that she
might have an opportunity of frequently repeat-
ing her title. And as she spoke, her fingers were
in perpetual motion, either adjusting her tucker,
arranging the plaits of her robe, or playing with
a diamond cross that hung on her bosom; her
eyes still accompanying her fingers as they mov-
ed, or being now and then suddenly snatched off,
that she might not be observed to think of her
dress: yet, in spite of all her artifice, it was plain
that her thoughts were wholly occupied by that
and by her new title.
Lady Fanny's dress was plain and neat, nor did
she seem to think at all about either that or her
title; but her manner was nevertheless so affect-
ed, and her eyes were so often turned towards a
looking-glass which unfortunately happened to

\
hang opposite to her, that she betrayed to every
discerning observer, the vanity of thinking herself
a beauty, and admiring herself for being such.
In short, these young ladies made themselves so
disagreeable, that every one was pleased when
Lady Caroline arose to go; who, as the eldest,
led the way, taking leave with a swimming cour-
tesy, followed by her sister, Lady Fanny, who
made a slow courtesy to every one in the room,
that she might be the longer under observation.
The little society, as soon as they were released,
retired to the arbour; where, without ceremony,
two or three of the elder young ladies began to
make their remarks on the ridiculous vanity of
their noble visitors. Miss Jenny allowed them to
proceed for some minutes, being at a loss, as the
strangers were her acquaintance, how to word her
reproof, so as not herself to appear personally of
fended. But at length, recovering her presence of
mind, “My dear school-fellows,” she said, “al-
though I do not attempt to defend what is amiss in
the young ladies who have just left us; yet I can-
not but say, that I think we are doing wrong to at-
tack them in their absence with so little reserve.
If we have seen anything faulty in their deport-
ment, let us endeavour to profit by it in examining
whether we ourselves may not have our share of
pride and vanity, although, from being in lower
circumstances, or not having the same personal
accomplishments, we may not be tempted to
make such a display of our qualifications.”

164 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
Those of the young people who had been most
forward in ridiculing Lady Caroline and Lady
Fanny, made Miss Jenny Peace no answer, but
blushing deeply, remained silent. Miss Nancy
Spruce however said, that she felt herself parti-
cularly blameable in joining the general laugh
against the strangers, since she could very well re-
member the time, when, without either the fortune
or title of Lady Caroline to suppport her preten-
sions, she had assumed as many airs of superiority
as that young lady had done. Being then re-
quested by all her companions to relate the history
of her life, she entered upon it without hesitation.
The Description of Miss Nancy Spruce.
Miss NANCY SPRUCE was just ten years old,
and was the very reverse of Patty Locket in all
things; for she had small limbs, small features,
and such a correctness of form, that she was
often called the little fairy. She had the misfor-
tune however to be lame in one of her hips;
though by good management and a certain brisk-
ness in her carriage, that blemish was scarcely
apparent, looking more like a peculiarity of gait
than any real defect.
The Life of Miss Nancy Spruce.
“MY delight,” said Miss Nancy Spruce, “ever

since I can remember, has been in dress and
finery; and partly perhaps from this cause—be-
cause whenever I did as I was bidden, I was pro-
mised fine coats, ribbons, and lace caps; and
when I was stubborn and naughty, then my fine
things were all locked up, and I was allowed to
wear only an old stuff coat: so that I was led to
imagine that the only proper reward for good
behaviour, was to be dressed fine; while the only
suitable punishment for the contrary, was to be
plainly dressed. Hence I delighted so much in
fine clothes, that I used to be constantly think-
ing of what new thing I should have next; sitting
whole hours to consider what should be the colour
of my mext new slip, a circumstance which was
always left to my choice.
“We lived in a country parish, where my papa
was the only gentleman; so that all the little girls
in the parish used to take it as a great honour to
play with me: on which occasions I delighted to
shew them my fine things, and to compare their
plain stuff coats with my silk and embroidered
ones. However, as they never pretended to any
sort of equality with me, I at least did not hate
them, though I was far enough from being kind
to them. But when I came to school, and saw
all my little companions as fine as myself, I grew
very miserable. Every handsome coat, every
silver ribbon, every gauze cap, every artificial
flower which my school-fellows wore, made me
unhappy. Your scarlet damask, Miss Betty Ford,

cost me a whole day's pain, and I even cried with
vexation the first time I saw you in it. I could
tell you many more thoughts of this kind which
I had, and which, since I have been led into some
acquaintance with myself, I am truly ashamed of.
But now I try never to think either of other
people's clothes, or of my own, any further than
to keep myself neat: and I am already much
happier on this account, although I must confess
that I am still often in danger of falling into my
former fault.”
As soon as Miss Nancy Spruce had finished
speaking, Miss Betty Ford said, that she heartily
forgave Miss Nancy for any evil thoughts she
might have had about her scarlet coat; “for,”
added she, “whatever your faults may have been,
Miss Nancy, I am sure that mine have equalled
them at least, if they have not been much worse.
And now to prove that what I say is true, I will,
if Miss Jenny pleases, give some account of my
past life.”
The Description of Miss Betty Ford.
Miss BETTY FoRD was of the same age as
Miss Nancy Spruce, and much of the same size;
but there was nothing naturally pretty or pleas-
ing in her person. Her face was ill shaped and
broad, and all the summer she was generally full
of freckles; however, when she looked good-


## p. 167 (#179) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 167
humoured, which she now began habitually to
do, there was nothing in her by any means dis-
agreeable: for however plain a face may be, it is
the evil of the heart only which can render any
set of features really unpleasant.
The Life of Miss Betty Ford.
“I HAD the misfortune to lose my mamma,”
said Miss Betty Ford, “before I can remember,
and the children of our family were brought up
by an elderly relation of my mother's, who kept
the house. As Miss Nancy Spruce's mind
was always occupied about finery, so I thought
of nothing but beauty.
“We had a large dining-room in which the
family commonly sat, and it was hung round
with pictures of my grandmother, her sisters,
and other female relations; there was also a
picture of my mother, who had been handsome.
And I used to hear the lady who had the care
of me frequently talking of these pictures, and
pointing out the beauty of many of them; often
adding this remark—“The females of our family
have always been distinguished for their beauty;
but poor little Betty does not look as if she be-
longed to them.’ And then she would find fault
with my features and my complexion, expressing
herself as if it was the greatest misfortune in the
world not to be handsome.


## p. 168 (#180) ############################################

168 THE Gover NEss; or, THE
“I had an elder sister whose face, however,
pleased her better; and indeed she was very
pretty, which I could not but observe, although
it cut me to the heart to acknowledge it. She
was so great a favourite with my elderly relation,
that whenever any visitors came to the house
she was always brought forward into notice, and
many praises bestowed upon her; while, to my
utter vexation, I was constantly overlooked.
“My sister Kitty was very good-natured all
this time, never insulting me, but doing all in
her power to oblige me. And when we were
quite alone, I was happy with her: but as often
as I heard her praises, my hatred would rise
against her, and often have I wished—such was
my wickedness—that something might happen
to spoil her beauty. At length my poor sister
caught a fever, and died. I cried a good deal
at the time of her death, and sometimes wished
I had behaved better to her.
“After my poor sister's death, I did not think
so much about beauty, excepting when I heard
the handsome pictures talked of, till I came to
school. Then the same desire of being handsome
returned, and I hated every one whom I thought
prettier than myself: so that I became more
miserable than ever, until my governess, and you,
Miss Jenny, pointed out to me the value of reli-
gion, and shewed me where to seek help in order
to overcome my evil passions. Since that time,

I have prayed to God to deliver me from every
evil temper. And although I still feel that I
have a very bad heart, and am often falling into
my old vice, yet I am far happier than I used to
be; and if the choice could now be given me, I
would much rather become good than beautiful.”
“My dear Miss Betty,” said Miss Jenny Peace,
when the little girl had done speaking, “it gives
me great pleasure to hear you express yourself
in this manner. There is nothing in this world
which can make us happy, but religion. If we
fear God, we shall find peace of mind in every
situation; and if we do not fear him, neither
beauty, health, wisdom, high rank, fine clothes,
riches, nor honours, can make us really happy for
a single moment.”
And now the little party, in much good-humour
and cheerfulness, attended their kind governess's
summons to supper; after which, evening prayers
being also concluded, they retired to their peace-
ful slumbers.

- The seventh Day.
THE next day, after the morning lessons were
finished, the little party returned again to their
arbour; when Miss Jenny Peace asked Miss
Henny Fret if she should have any objection to
relate the chief circumstances of her life, as it
was now come to her turn.
The little girl very modestly answered, that
there was nothing in her life worth relating, for
that she had always been a very naughty child:
but that she was willing to do any thing which
might be required of her for the satisfaction of
her school-fellows.
The Description of Miss Henny Fret.
Miss HENNY FRET was not yet nine years of
age. She was one of those children whose good
looks entirely depend on the state of their mind,
there being nothing remarkable, either one way
or other, in her person; therefore, as she had
hitherto been carelessly brought up, and allowed


## p. 171 (#183) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 171
to indulge every evil passion incident to our fallen
nature, she had passed, in general, for a plain, in-
significant, unpleasant little girl. She had more-
over acquired a habit of raising her upper lip in
such a manner as constantly to shew her teeth;
added to which there was a certain fretfulness
and anxiety about her countenance which had
not yet wholly given way to the better mode of
treatment she had received under Mrs. Teach-
um's care. She was now however evidently
struggling with her temper, and sometimes with
so much success as to render the whole expres-
sion of her countenance agreeable; and, in con-
sequence, she appeared, at times, quite another
child.
The Life of Miss Henny Fret.
“I HAD one brother,” said Miss Henny, “as
Miss Jenny Peace had; but my manner of living
with him was quite the reverse of that in which
she lived with her brother. I was also managed
in a very different way from that which was
adopted in Miss Jenny's case; for all my praise
or blame was to arise from my being better or
worse than my brother.
“If I was guilty of any fault, it was immedi-
ately said, “Oh fie, Missl Master George would
not be guilty of such a thing for the world.' If
he was carried abroad, while I was kept at home,

then I was bemoaned or encouraged in such
terms as these—“Poor Miss Henny is left at
home, and her brother is carried abroad l but, on
one of these days, she shall go abroad, and her
brother be left at home.’ Hence it happened,
that whenever I went abroad, my greatest joy
was, that he was left at home; and it pleased
me to see him come to the coach-door with a
melancholy air, and full of sorrow because he
could not go too. If my brother happened to
have any fruit given him, and, being in a peevish
humour, would not allow me as much of it as I
desired, the servant that attended me was sure
to bid me take care, when I had any thing he
wanted, not to give him any: so that I thought,
if I did not endeavour to be revenged on him, I
should shew a want of spirit, which was of all
things what I dreaded most.
“I had a better memory than my brother; so
that whenever I learned any thing, my comfort
was to laugh at him, because he could not learn
so fast: but while I got a good deal by rote, I
neither minded what I learned, nor took any
pains to retain it. And thus, what I was eager
to learn one day, in order to shew George how
much cleverer I was than himself, I forgot the
thext.
“Being a great favourite in the house, I was
never denied any thing I asked for; but I was
nevertheless very unhappy, for the same reason

that Miss Dolly Friendly's sister was so. I have
even sometimes sat down and cried, because I did
not know what I would have: till at last, I grew
so peevish and humoursome, as to be always on
the fret. In this unhappy condition I lived till I
came to school: and here finding that the other
young ladies wanted to have their humours indul-
ged as well as myself, I became more miserable
than ever, and continued so till our happy recon-
ciliation took place; when I was taught that God
would help me to behave better, if I would but
ask him.”
Here Miss Henny Fret ceasing, Miss Jenny
Peace thus addressed the little party: “We have
all, my dear school-fellows, abundant reason to
thank God, who has put every one of us in the
way of overcoming our evil passions; and let us
pray that the good work which he has, in his in-
finite mercy, begun, may meet with no opposition
from us.”
Now all the little company having told the
history of their past lives excepting Miss Polly
Suckling, Miss Jenny, smiling, addressed the little
darling, and asked her if she would be so kind as
to tell her school-fellows what she could remem-
ber of her past life.
Miss Polly coloured when thus addressed, but
very prettily complied with the request.

The Description of Miss Polly Suckling.
Miss Polly SUCKLING was not six years of
age, and so short of her age, that few people took
her to be much above four. She had the most
exactly proportioned limbs in the world, very
small bones, and was as fat as a little cherub.
She was extremely fair, her hair quite flaxen, her
eyes a dark blue, her lips plump and red, and
when she smiled, she seemed to shew a hundred
dimples. She was, in short, the very picture of
health and infantine beauty, and was the play-
thing of the whole school.
The Life of Miss Polly Suckling.
“I Do not know much of myself,” said little
Polly, “only that I do not remember my poor
mamma, for she died a great many years ago.
But papa loves me very much, and I love my
papa; and I love my governess, and my school-
fellows, but Miss Jenny best of all. And I should
like to be good, and hope that God will help me
to be good; for my governess says, that God loves
little children, and that the Lord Jesus Christ died
to save us from going to hell.”
When little Polly had finished her short story,
all her companions kissed her; and Miss Jenny
especially testified much tenderness towards her,

taking her in her arms, and saying, “God will
bless you, my little darling, and will make you
good; for he carrieth the lambs in his arms,
and they who seek him early shall assuredly
find him.”
By this time the dinner bell rang; and when
the little party had assembled at table, Mrs.
Teachum informed them that she expected a per-
son upon particular business in the afternoon,
whose presence would prevent her usual atten-
tions to them; and that therefore she should send
them, under the care of a servant, to convey to
the old woman at the dairy-house, a certain book
of devotions which she had promised her.
The young people heard this proposal with
joy; and little Polly assured her governess, that
she would not say one word to the old woman
about her grey hairs and her shaking head.
Dinner being ended, they soon appeared ready
for their walk; when they set out, attended by
two maid-servants. As soon as they arrived at
the dairy-house, the good old woman expressed
great pleasure in seeing them, and told little Polly,
that she should have plenty of cream and straw-
berries, for her daughter had been that day in
the woods, and had brought home three baskets
of very fine strawberries.
Mrs. Nelly, the daughter, said, very crossly,

that she supposed there would be fine work
among them in the absence of their governess,
for it was her mother's way to let all children
be as rude as they pleased.
Miss Sukey Jennet, with some indignation in
her countenance, was going to answer; but Miss
Jenny Peace, fearing that she would say some-
thing less mild than might be wished, gave her
a significant look, and turning to the young wo-
man, with great modesty and good temper, said,
“I hope you will see, Mrs. Nelly, that our good
governess's instructions are of more force than
to lose all their effect when we are out of her
sight, and that we have also some fear of God,
who, you know, is present with us, although our
governess is absent: and I trust you will have no
cause, when we go away, to complain of our ill-
behaviour.”
Mrs. Nelly's anger being thus appeased, she
soon loaded the long table with strawberries and
cream. Of which, when the children had eaten
what Miss Jenny thought proper, they took their
leave with the utmost civility; but not before
each little Miss had received a pretty posy of
pinks and roses from the kind old woman, who
said she had never seen better behaved or sweeter
tempered children in her life. And even Mrs.
Nelly herself was so pleased with their regular
and inoffensive behaviour, that she could not help
telling Miss Jenny, that she and all her compa-

mions had indeed behaved as well as if their
governess had been with them.
Miss Jenny did not forget to reward the old
woman handsomely for her good cheer. And as
they were walking home, she observed to Miss
Sukey Jennett, whom she had prevented from
making any answer to Mrs. Nelly's speech, how
much better it was to gain another person's good
will by our own endeavours to be obliging, than
to provoke them to be more cross by our angry
answers and reproaches.
As this little company proceeded homewards,
enlivening their way with pleasing talk and lively
observations, they passed near to a nobleman's
house, situated in a beautiful park; where, after
stopping a few minutes to look about them, the
young people expressed a wish that their gover-
ness would, some time or other, permit them to
visit that fine house, when the nobleman and his
family were absent.
Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper, who by chance
was walking that way, and heard what the young
ladies said, immediately came up to them, and
told Miss Jenny, that her Lord and Lady were
then absent, having set out, one for London, and
the other for another fine seat forty miles off,
that very morning. And as she knew them to
be Mrs. Teachum's well-regulated family, she
took that occasion to inform them, that they

should be welcome to see the house and gardens
now or at any time they pleased.
Miss Jenny thanked Mrs. Wilson, and said, as
it was nearly two hours sooner than their gover-
ness expected them home, she would accept of
her kind offer. Accordingly, the housekeeper led
the young people, through an avenue of tall elm
trees, towards this magnificent house; in which
they found many spacious apartments, furnished
with the utmost elegance and grandeur. Some of
the rooms were adorned with fine pictures, others
were hung with tapestry scarcely less beautiful
than those paintings, and most of the apartments
above stairs were furnished with the finest sort
of needle-work.
The little party were struck into a sort of silent
wonder and admiration at the splendid appear-
ance of every thing around them, nor could they
find words to express the various perceptions ex-
cited in their minds by such a variety of dazzling
and gaudy things: but when they came to the
needle-work, it was impossible to help smiling to
see how every one chiefly fixed her attention
upon that sort of work in which she herself was
employed.
The good-natured housekeeper was greatly
pleased to see the young people so much de-
lighted, and answered all their questions con-
cerning the stories represented in the pictures

and tapestry, as fully as the time would per-
mit.
Miss Jenny however, being fearful of exceeding
the hour which had been fixed for their return,
told her young companions, that they must not
now tarry any longer; but that if their governess
should give them leave, and it would not be trou-
blesome to Mrs. Wilson, they would come an-
other time.
To which Mrs. Wilson replied, that it was so
far from being troublesome, that she never had
more satisfaction in her life, than to see so many
well-behaved young ladies, who all seemed, not
only pleased with what they saw, but doubly de-
lighted and happy in seeing each other pleased.
In short, she said they should not go till they
had been in her room, and eaten some sweet-
meats of her own making; which, overcome by
the importunity of the good woman, Miss Jenny
at length consented to do. Accordingly, they
followed Mrs. Wilson to her own room: in
which, when they all were seated, little Miss
Polly Suckling brake out with great glee, “Well,
this is a most charming house; I wish we could
all live here for ever. How happy must be the
Lord and Lady of this fine place!”
“My dear Miss Polly Suckling,” said Miss
Jenny, “do you think that these things really
make people happy? Has not our good gover-


## p. 180 (#192) ############################################

180 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
ness often told us, that such things have in re-
ality nothing at all to do with happiness?”
“It is very true,” said the housekeeper, “for
even my Lord and Lady appear to have no de-
light in all this magnificence. Daily accustomed
to the splendour of the place, they walk through
all these apartments, without ever seeming to ob-
serve anything in them; or if they observe them
at all, it is rather with a look that denotes a sort
of discontent than with any kind of pleasure.”
Then turning off the discourse with a deep sigh,
Mrs. Wilson presented each of the young ladies
with a paper of dried sweetmeats; after which,
insisting upon a repetition of their promise, that,
with Mrs. Teachum's consent, they would come
again to see the gardens, she allowed them to
take their leave, which they did in the most
courteous manner.
Upon reaching their home, Miss Jenny gave
her governess a faithful account of all that had
passed, not forgetting the agreeable entertainment
they had accidentally met with of seeing Lord
X 's fine house; together with the great civi-
lity of Mrs. Wilson, “which I hope, Madam,”
said Miss Jenny, “I did not do wrong in accept-
ing.”
“You did very properly, my dear,” said Mrs.
Teachum.; “for when people are willing to oblige
you, and can do so without any inconvenience to

themselves, it is always right to accept their effer,
since you even gratify them, by putting it into
their power to give you pleasure.”
Miss Jenny then told Mrs. Teachum many
things which had passed in conversation during
their walk to the dairy-house; and especially
what little Polly Suckling had said in the house-
keeper's room, together with Mrs. Wilson's an-
swer; adding, that by Mrs. Wilson's downcast
look, she was fearful that poor Lord X and
his Lady were not so happy as might be wished:
“but,” continued she, “I did not ask Mrs.
Wilson any questions, recollecting your admo-
nition, Madam, carefully to avoid impertinent
curiosity.”
“You were very right, my dear,” said Mrs.
Teachum, “in asking no further questions; nor
would she, I dare say, as she is a prudent wo-
man, have gratified you, if you had; for though
the unhappy story is too well known all over the
country, yet it would have been very unbecoming
in one of the family to have repeated it.”
Mrs. Teachum then gave Miss Jenny a short
account of the sad history of Lord and Lady
X “This nobleman and his Lady,” said
she, “ have been married seven years. Lord
X is the most discontented of men, because
he has no children, and consequently no heir to
his honours and estates. He is naturally of a

haughty, impetuous temper, impatient of all dis-
appointment; and this disposition not being sub-
dued in his youth, has led him into all sorts
of excesses. His Lady not being much better
tempered than his Lordship, and valuing herself
highly upon her beauty and the large fortune she
brought him, greatly resents his treatment of her.
So that having hitherto lived in the most unhappy
way, they have at last agreed to part by mutual
consent; and the different journeys they have
this morning taken, were, I suppose, the prelude
to a final separation.”
Having said thus much, Mrs. Teachum wished
Miss Jenny a good night, who immediately retired
to rest with her little companions.

FIRIDAY,
The eighth Day.
MRS. TEACHUM in the morning enquired how
her scholars were after their walk, and was pleas-
ed to hear that they were quite well. They then
performed their several tasks with cheerfulness—
and after the evening school-hours, when they
were hastening as usual to the arbour, Mrs.
Teachum called Miss Jenny into her parlour, and
said, “My dear child, if you have nothing parti-
cularly prepared for this day's amusement, I shall
have a pleasure in confiding to you the account
of a young lady, which I received many years
ago, in a letter from a friend: not doubting but
that you will, with the blessing of Almighty God,
be profited by it, and find in it an additional
motive to prepare early for that change which
must pass upon all men, the appointed time of
which is known only to the Almighty.” So say-
ing, Mrs. §eachum presented Miss Jenny with
a small manuscript, containing a copy of her
friend's letter; as she would on no account trust
the valued original out of her own hands, which
she carefully preserved, with other memorials
of former days and past events, in a small Indian

184 THE Gover NESS; OR, THE
cabinet, standing between the windows of her
parlour.
Miss Jenny received the manuscript as a mark
of great confidence, and having thanked her go-
verness with a low courtesy and a smile, she
hastened to the arbour, in which, by this time,
all the party were assembled.
When Miss Jenny informed them on what ac-
count their governess had called her apart, and
shewed them the little book which had been con-
fided to her for their amusement and profit, they
expressed great joy, and intreated her to begin
the reading of it immediately; with which request
she complied without delay.
A Letter from Mrs. Graham of the City of Lon-
don, to her friend Mrs. Teachum, dated Anno
Domini, 1730.
MY DEAR FRIEND,
YoU ask me for some ac-
count of my Emily, my lovely Emily. O my
friend! you know not what pain you give me by
such a request; and yet you say, thºt if I have
but courage to recal to mind, and, in its due
order, commit to paper what I first knew of my
Emily, and the manner in which this sweet child
daily waited upon the Lord for a renewal of
strength, thereby being enabled to fulfil in an

exemplary manner all the duties of life, it might
hereafter become a source of mournful pleasure
to myself, and of profit to others; inasmuch as
from the view, however imperfect, which I might
be able to hold out of this fair model, others of
the sinful children of Adam might learn to mount
up with wings as eagles; to run and not be
weary; to walk and not faint. (Isaiah xl. 31.)
But Oh! when I feel the sad assurance that I
am for ever on earth separated from this my
darling, and that while she yet was spared to me
I fulfilled my duty towards her so imperfectly;
and when I remember how little I profited by the
sweet teachings and gentle persuasions of this
holy child; the anguish of my feelings becomes
almost intolerable: and yet, I know that all this
trouble is no more than needful to teach me the
sinfulness of my nature, and the value of my soul.
But to speak no more on what relates merely to
myself, I proceed to fulfil the painful task which
your friendship has appointed me.
My husband, as you well know, is a merchant,
and has been exceedingly successful in all his
transactions, insomuch that we for many years
past have been in a very affluent condition.
One circumstance, however, greatly imbittered
the enjoyment of our riches; we had no child:
the almighty Ruler of all things, by whom every
thing is well done, refused us the gratification of
our wishes in that respect. I will not say with
what little patience I submitted at first to this

186 THE GOVERNEss; OR, THE
dispensation of Providence: but at the time I
speak of, I had no sense of vital religion; I at-
tended, it is true, to its outward forms, but my
heart had never known the sweet influences of
Christianity. -
A little more than twelve years ago, my husband
having had a severe illness, we were advised to
spend our summer months in the country. As
expence was no object to us, we took a journey
into the north of England, and there hired for the
season an old-fashioned house, situated in a garden
abounding with fruits and flowers of various kinds.
Here, having no employment, and but few neigh-
bours, and as Mr. Graham was unable to take
much exercise, we spent a great part of our time
in sitting on a garden-chair, which we found under
the spreading branches of a walnut tree, situated
on a round plot of grass in the centre of the gar-
den. On this pleasant spot, while I employed my-
self with my needle, my husband read to me the
Pastorals of Phillips, the Arcadia of Sir Philip
Sydney, and the Spectators and Tatlers, with
other fashionable works of the day: by which we
found ourselves amused, our taste perhaps im-
proved, and some kind of indistinct respect for
religion and morality acquired. But still we re-
mained in great darkness as to vital religion, and
were deplorably ignorant of those important doc-
trines on which the great truths of the Gospel are
built; namely, the utter depravity of the human
heart, and our absolute need of a Saviour.


## p. 187 (#199) ############################################

From this our walnut tree seat we were pre-
sented with one of the most lovely prospects which
can be imagined. Our garden and house were
situated on the declivity of a considerable emi-
nence. Directly on our front was an orchard,
below which appeared a rich country, abounding
with woods, from the centre of which, at a consi-
derable distance, arose the tower of a church. On
the right hand a different prospect opened to our
view—a range of hills of considerable height ter-
minated the horizon, whence an irregular and ex-
ceedingly beautiful country descended to the banks
of a river, which wound its secret course through
the bottom of the valley. On the nearer side of
the river the country was smiling and fertile, abound-
ing with orchards, corn-fields, and cottages.
One feature in this landscape particularly pleas-
ed my fancy: it was a little foot-path which,
passing by our garden-gate, and descending into
the valley, appeared again at the distance of about
a quarter of a mile, winding through a corn-field
till it was lost at the entrance of a little coppice.
From the centre of this coppice arose a white
chimney, the blue smoke of which indicated that
the place was inhabited; but it was left to my
imagination to picture by what kind of persons.
Nor did I fail to indulge my fancy, by supposing
it might be the abode of some Phillis and Damon,
these being the most perfect beings of which I
could then form an idea; not knowing that these
fabled creatures, these shepherds and shepherd-

188 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
esses of an imaginary Arcadia, are often as much
surpassed in true elegance and courtesy of man-
ners by the humble Christian, however mean his
situation, as the ordinary inhabitants of cottages
are excelled by the pastors and pastorellas of fable.
But I as yet was wholly blind to all the perfec-
tions and beauties of religion: though born in a
Christian country, I knew no more of the Chris-
tian religion than its name. I knew nothing of
redeeming love, or of the power of the Spirit in
restoring the original loveliness of our fallen na-
ture. I seemed to have no faculty by which these
things could be received or comprehended: for
the natural man savoureth not the things which be
of God, but those that be of men. (Matt. xvi. 23.)
But, be this as it would, I was much taken with
the little path, together with the cottage in the
wood to which it led; and no doubt prattled much
sentimental nonsense to my indulgent husband on
the subject. But to go on with my story.
It happened, one morning, about ten o'clock,
as we were sitting in our usual place, that I saw
something coming out of the little coppice and
proceeding towards us along the path; but at
that distance, whatever it might be, it appeared
only like a black speck. After a little while I
looked again, when I could distinguish a small
figure clothed in black; and as the figure ap-
Proached, I perceived it was a little girl, perhaps

not seven years of age, carrying a basket. She
came tripping along with a light and graceful
step, discovering in every motion so peculiar a
vivacity and elegance as greatly attracted my
attention, and convinced me that, whatever her
place of abode or her parentage might be, there
was in her something which I had not often ob-
served in children; yet what this was, I could not
define. I watched her till she had passed the
garden-gate; and about an hour afterwards saw
her return, having been, as I supposed, to the
village, which was at some little distance from
our hired habitation. I marked her till she had
retraced her steps, and entered again into the
coppice. A second view did not destroy the first
impression which the appearance of this little girl
had made upon my imagination; and as my head
was then filled with poetical and pastoral ideas
from the books which we had been reading, I said
to my husband, “This little girl wants only to
lay aside her mourning dress, and to be clothed
in white, with a straw hat, a wreath of flowers,
and a crook, to become as elegant a shepherdess
as any described by Sir Philip Sydney.”
The next day about the same hour, while we
were engaged as usual under our walnut tree, the
little shepherdess appeared again. I traced her
uneven and childish steps, as she sometimes trip-
ped hastily onwards, and then stopped and stoop-
ed, as I rightly guessed, to gather flowers; for I
afterwards saw a few violets tied together with a

blade of grass in her basket. At length she as-
cended the hill towards us, while I went out at
the gate of the garden to look at her, resolving, if
I liked her equally well on a near approach as at
a distance, to speak to her.
I had time to examine her minutely, as she came
forward. When she first perceived me, dressed
as I then was, in my large hoop, my silk gown and
petticoat, full trimmed, and my head dressed, I
thought that she would have expressed some sur-
prise; but the only visible effect my figure pro-
duced upon her was, that she walked forward with
more steadiness than before, yet without the least
appearance of embarrassment. Her hood was not
pulled very far over her face, and her fair brown
hair was gently agitated by the breeze. But it is
impossible to describe her countenance, and equal-
ly so to give an idea of the delicacy of her fea-
tures, or the sparkling vivacity of her blue eyes:
yet what was most remarkable in this child was,
a dignified kind of carriage and self-possession,
which was not in the least disturbed when I ad-
dressed her. She was exceedingly fair; but air
and exercise had given her a high bloom, which
added much to the sweetness of her appearance.
In her hand she carried a basket, which had no-
thing in it but the bunch of violets before spoken
of Her dress was mourning, and, though neat,
bespoke an attention to economy.
I had now stepped into the middle of the path,


## p. 191 (#203) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 191
and addressing her "as she came up,-I asked her
name, her place of abode, and several other ques-
tions. In answer to which, she made me under-
stand that her name was Emily; that her father,
who had been an officer, was lately dead; that
she once had a very dear little sister, who was
also no more; and that now she only was left to
her dear mamma. She added, that her mother
having left the place in which she formerly re-
sided with her father, had come to live at a cot-
tage in the wood, which she pointed out to me,
where they occupied only one room, there being
other inhabitants in the house. She informed me
also that her mother was very ill.
While she gave me this account, which she
entered upon without confusion or hesitation, the
colour rose in her cheeks, her eyes filled with
tears, her lip quivered, and at length she burst
into an agony of crying, making a motion as if
she would have thrown herself into my arms, as,
no doubt, she had been accustomed to do, on
like occasions, into those of her tender mother;
but hastily recollecting herself, she recovered with
a peculiar dignity, and stopping short, was going
to wish me a good morning with much sweetness
and courtesy; when I said, “My little Miss, do
not be in a hurry to leave me. Tell me why you
cry. And let me know if I can do any thing to
comfort you?”
“When I think of my papa and my little sis-

192 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
ter,” she answered, “I cannot help crying; and
yet I know it is wrong.”
“Wrong, my dear!” I answered, “why should
it be wrong to weep for such dear friends?”
“Because,” she answered, “they are very hap-
py, they are gone to our Lord Jesus Christ, and
are in his house: I know this, and therefore I
ought to be glad, and not to cry.”
I found my heart strangely drawn to this little
girl from the first moment I saw her distinctly,
and every word she said increased my interest
in her. Finding however a reluctance to speak
with her on religious subjects, I enquired only
whither she was going.
“I am going, Ma'am,” she said, “to the village,
to fetch a roll for my mother, and one for myself,
with a little pot of butter, and some medicine for
my mother; and I go almost every day.”
“And these violets,” said I, “what are they for?”
“They are to put in a glass in my mother's
room,” she answered; “I thought she would never
go out and get violets again, and therefore I gather-
ed them for her. But my mother is not unhappy
about being ill,” added the sweet little girl,
“because our dear Saviour visits and comforts
her.”

I found myself strangely affected by the dis-
course of the little Emily. There was an elegance
and a refinement in her ideas, which I had never
before observed about a child; and being totally
ignorant, as I before said, of the power of the
Holy Spirit of God in producing these beautiful
effects, I attributed them to the more than ordi-
nary care of a refined and well-instructed mother
in the direction of her early studies. But again, I
thought that accomplishments of this kind are
above the capacities of children. Where then,
and how can this child have acquired these ideas?
Had I understood the following passage of Scrip-
ture, I should not have had so much difficulty in
tracing the peculiar loveliness of this little girl to
its right cause—Awake, O north wind; and come,
thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out. (Sol. Song iv. 16.)
Being, however, not a little confused and per-
plexed with what I had seen and heard, I wished
Miss Emily a good morning; and hoping that I
should meet her again some other time, as she
so often came that way, I returned into my gar-
den.
The next day the little shepherdess appeared
again with her basket. I met her at the gate, and
invited her in; while she, with great politeness,
begged to be excused till she had asked her mo-
ther's leave. I wished to present her to Mr.
Graham, and would have had her come in without
S

waiting her mother's permission; but she refused
with a mixture of inflexibility and sweetness, say-
ing, “I must not disobey my poor mother, now
she is ill in bed.”
I replied, “You are a sweet good child, Miss
Emily, and your mother is very happy in having
such a little girl.”
“Mamma loves me,” she answered, “but I am
not good.”
This reply of the little girl's surprised me; and
on questioning her further, she made me under-
stand that her mamma had taught her, that all
mankind are sinful and utterly depraved, and that
she herself could not do the least thing well, with-
out the help of the Holy Spirit of God.
It cannot be supposed that I could have lived
between thirty and forty years in a Christian coun-
try, and been constantly in the habit of attending
the divine ordinances, without hearing of the de-
pravity of human nature; or that I could have
read the Bible continually, as I had been in the
habit of doing, and never have found it there: yet
so it was, that this doctrine, out of the mouth of
this little girl, seemed perfectly new to me, and
came with a force which I could not account for.
I felt ashamed and embarrassed before the child,
and hardly had presence of mind to say to her,
“Well, my little Miss, go home now, and if your

mamma will give you leave, call upon us to-mor-
row in your way to the village.”
Mr. Graham smiled at my enthusiastic descrip-
tion of the little Emily; but the next day, when
she came, with her mother's permission, into the
garden to speak to us in her way to the village,
he confessed that she fully answered my descrip-
tion of her.
From that time for a few weeks she came every
morning, when I generally contrived to have some
little nice thing to send by her to her mother,
from whom I received many grateful messages in
return, with one or two little notes, elegantly
written on small slips of paper, expressive of gra-
titude, not only for my kindness to herself, but
to her little Emily.
Finding, however, that what I had done for this
distressed lady was too little, I resolved, as soon
as Mr. Graham should be able to walk, that we
would go together to see her, the cottage in
which she resided being so situated as not to be
approached safely with a carriage.
In the mean time, as the summer advanced, the
strawberries in the garden began to ripen fast:
but we had not yet gathered any, when one morn-
ing our little Emily came in as usual, and with a
peculiar meaning in her sweet face, stood awhile,
lingering and looking earnestly at me, even after I

had told her that it was time to go: for her poor
mother, in one of her notes, had requested me not
to detain her longer than a certain hour, adding,
that she could not bear to be long deprived of
her. Emily however, as I said before, this day
lingered some minutes after I had told her it was
time to go. At length, colouring deeply, she said,
“Ma'am, will you sell me some strawberries?”
I was surprised at the request, and the more,
as she had never before asked for any thing. I
was going to say, “No, my dear, I will give you
some;” but Mr. Graham checked me, whispering,
that he wished to know what the little girl was
about.
“I have got a penny of my own, Ma'am,” she
said, perceiving my hesitation, “and I should like
to buy some strawberries instead of a roll.”
“What, for your own eating 2" I said.
“No,” she answered, “not for myself.”
Mr. Graham himself immediately gathered her
a large cabbage-leaf full, and took her penny; at
which she appeared to be in an ecstacy of joy,
her whole face brightening up in a manner that I
had never witnessed in any creature before.
“I shall be so happy now!” she said. “Yes-
terday my mamma wished for strawberries, and

now I shall have some to give her.” She then
took her leave, and hastened to the village.
I contrived to meet her at the garden-gate as
she came back. I looked into her basket, and
saw that the number of strawberries was not dimi-
nished, and that she had purchased but one roll.
The joy of her countenance still remained without
any abatement; and cheerfully wishing me a good
morning as she passed, I watched her as she went
tripping along the little path-way.
The next day, at the usual time, my little Emily
appeared again. She came running into the gar-
den with her basket, to tell us that her dear mam-
ma had enjoyed the strawberries so much l—so
very much! In her hand she held her penny, and
begged us to sell her some more strawberries.
“But, my dear,” said Mr. Graham, taking
her upon his knee, for he was now become even
fonder of her than I was, if it were possible to be
so, “what did you do for your supper ?”
She looked earnestly at him, not knowing what
he meant.
“Your roll!” he said, “how did you do with-
out your roll?—you had no roll last night.”
“I did not want my roll; I saved some of my
potatoes at dinner, to eat at night,” she answered.

“But, my dear,” enquired I, “what did your
mamma say, when she saw you eating pota-
toes?"
On hearing this question, her cheeks reddened,
and her eyes filled with tears. “Oh, Ma'am!"
she answered, “my poor mamma does not know
now what I do.” She could say no more; but
being quite overcome, threw her arms round my
neck, and burst into an agony of grief.
“What! my child,” I said, much affected, “is
your mamma so very ill?” -
I found, by her answers, that the poor lady had
kept her bed for several days; but I could not
find out whether she was actually in danger of
death: however, I told the little girl that I would
certainly come the next day and see her.
On hearing this, her countenance brightened up,
and she began to tell me how her mamma had
relished the strawberries. “She ate them all,
Ma'am,” said the little girl, “so eagerlyl and this
morning she wants more; and here, Ma'am, is my
penny.”
“No, my Emily,” said Mr. Graham, quite affect-
ed, “no, no, we will not have your poor penny,
sweet child. Take it back; you are welcome ten
thousand times, and so is your dear mother, to all
our garden can afford, and our house too.”

“But please, Sir,” said the sweet little girl,
“please to take my penny: I want to give the
strawberries to mamma—please to let me buy
them.”
There was no resisting the gentle importunity of
the lovely child: it seemed to give her particular
pleasure to deny herself in order to gratify her
mother. There was a touching mixture of child-
ishness and warm disinterested love in the conduct
of this dear little girl, of which I never before
could have formed a conception, and which quite
overcame Mr. Graham and myself. We could not
resist her, but, taking her penny, we all set to work
to gather the strawberries; with which she hasten-
ed home as before, transported with joy.
The next morning I prepared myself for a walk
to the cottage in the wood, which was the residence
of my Emily, intending to have accompanied the
little fair one back again, when she came, as I ex-
pected she would, for strawberries. At the usual
time therefore I looked for her; but she came
not. An hour or more passed away in expecta-
tion; but no little figure in black appeared trip-
ping along the path-way. Mr. Graham began to
be uneasy, and walked two or three times to the
garden-gate to look out for his little darling.
At length some one came out from the wood:
we at first thought it was our Emily, but we pre-
sently could distinguish a woman in a grey cloak.


## p. 200 (#212) ############################################

200 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
She ascended the hill, and coming in at the gar-
den-gate, told us, in reply to our eager questions,
that she was the daughter of the poor woman in
whose cottage Mrs. Norton (our Emily's mamma)
had lodged; and that she now came to tell us, the
poor lady had died early in the morning, leaving
no directions what was to be done with her dear
child, or about her own funeral, excepting only a
letter to her nearest relation, which was to be put
in the post-office. This letter, the young woman
informed us, had been sent immediately as the
writer had breathed her last. “But in the mean
time,” added she, “we know not what to do with
poor little Miss, who takes on so bitterly, that
we fear she will do herself a mischief; and as we
know that she loves you, Madam, and the gentle-
man here, my mother has made bold to send me
for your advice.”
I cannot tell you how I was affected on hear-
ing of the poor lady's death, nor how much I
reproached myself for my neglect in not having
once gone to see her. I burst into a flood of
tears, and loudly lamented my negligence: while
Mr. Graham kindly comforted me, saying, “Do
not afflict yourself, my dear; the little Emily is
left, and has probably no friends who love her as
we do. We have no children; let us adopt her.
She shall be your child, if God permits, and you
shall fill up the place of the mother she has lost.”
Animated and comforted with this sweet hope, I

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 201
immediately rose to follow the woman, requesting
Mr. Graham to send a man-servant after me to the
cottage, in case any assistance might be wanted.
I cannot describe to you how strangely I was
affected as I trod the narrow foot-path, in which I
had so often traced with an eye of affection the
little shepherdess as I always loved to call our
Emily. At length we entered the wood, where
we saw before us at a small distance, deep in the
shade, a white cottage, having an upper room, in
which, from the window being open, I supposed
the corpse to be lying.
A neat old woman, on whose venerable coun-
tenance the tenderest feelings of sorrow were de-
picted, came forth to meet us, and to say how
thankful she was for my kindness in coming down.
“Where, my good woman,” I said, “is my
little Emily?”
“Oh, Madam,” she answered, “it would have
cut you to the heart had you seen her yesterday.
She came in from your house about eleven o'clock,
as blithe as a bird, and ran up to her mamma
with the strawberries: but the poor lady had
taken a change while little Miss was away, and
was even then dying. She could not take the
strawberries which the sweet babe offered her; yet
it was plain to see she was pleased and touched
with the kind attentions of the dear little Miss: for


## p. 202 (#214) ############################################

202 the Gover NEss; or, THE
she prayed earnestly for her child, her lovely
Emily as she called her, and some of her words
were these:– O' my God, I leave my child with-
out anxiety; for her Redeemer is mighty, he will
plead her cause with thee.” (Prov. xxiii. 11.)
I could bear to hear no more of the old woman's
discourse; but hastening on, entered the cottage.
I passed through the lower apartment to a narrow
staircase, which ascending quickly, with a beating
heart I entered the chamber of death.
There such a scene presented itself as I never
can forget. On a decent bed lay the poor corpse,
neatly laid out; but the figure was so death-like,
so emaciated by long or sharp sickness, as to
convey no idea to my mind of what the poor lady
might have been when in health. By the side of
the bed, which was low, on a little footstool sat
the lovely Emily; and, O affecting circumstance!
having removed the lifeless arm from the position
in which it had been placed by those who had
laid out the corpse, and resting her sweet face and
ruby lips upon the pale cold hand, (overcome
with fatigue and sorrow, after watching all the
night,) she had thus fallen into a deep sleep.
What a contrast appeared between the counte-
nance of the mother worn with sickness and fixed
in death, and that of the blooming daughter! for
though her mournful pillow was no other than
the cold hand of her dead mother, (a hand which


## p. 203 (#215) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 203
had been the guard and support of her tenderest
infancy,) yet the kindly warmth of balmy sleep
had flushed the fair cheek of the little Emily,
and was gently restoring the strength and spirits
which her late watching and sorrow had ex-
hausted.
The apartment was, as might be expected, mean-
ly furnished: nevertheless it contained several lit-
tle things which pointed it out as having been the
residence of one who had fallen from a state of
comparative affluence.
Over the narrow chimney-piece hung the por-
trait of an officer dressed in full uniform, which I
conceived immediately to be Emily's father. On a
little round table stood a gold watch, the beating
of which was distinctly heard in the death-like si-
lence of the apartment; and near it lay a handsome
Bible, which appeared to have been much used.
But what affected me most, was the little basket
of strawberries, for which the sweet daughter had
a second time paid the price of a self-denying act
rarely practised by children. She had procured
those strawberries as a gratification for her dying
parent: but it was a gratification which came too
late to be enjoyed.
Having gazed for some minutes on this scene, I
turned round to the old woman and her daughter,
who had followed me up stairs.


## p. 204 (#216) ############################################

204 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
I know not what my countenance expressed, but
the old woman seeming to discover in it something
of disapprobation, said softly but earnestly, “In-
deed, indeed, Madam, we could not get little Miss
away; she would not leave her mother, but was
ready to die with grief whenever we attempted to
remove her.”
“Then,” I answered, “now must be the time to
separate them:” and hearing my servant below, I
called him up, and directed him gently to lift up
the sweet child, and convey her with as soft a
motion as possible to our house. This was done
as I wished. Into so sound a sleep had she fallen,
that he raised her up without waking her, and
carried her away; leaving me standing by the
corpse.
Very affecting thoughts passed through my
mind as we were removing the child from the re-
mains of that tender parent, who had so carefully
watched over her from early infancy.
“Oh! poor corpse!” at length I said; “I re-
move your Emily—her tears will never again
moisten your cold hand—but I will, God permit-
ting, supply your place. Yes;” I said, kissing the
hand on which the sweet child's cheek had so late-
ly rested, “I will be a mother to your Emily—but
Oh! I am not worthy to fill your place—I have
hitherto lived as without God in the world—The
Bible has not been my companion as it was yours


## p. 205 (#217) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 205
—I have lived a stranger to my Saviour; a lover
of pleasure rather than a lover of God.”
Speaking to this effect, I fell on my knees by
the bed, and still holding the hand of the corpse,
I prayed in a manner which I never had done be-
fore, not with the lips, but with the heart; my
affections, I humbly trust, being under the influ-
ence of that Holy Spirit who helpeth our infirmi-
ties: for we know not what we should pray for as
we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh interces-
sion for us with groanings which cannot be ut-
tered. (Rom. viii. 26.)
The import of my prayer was this—that, if it
should please God to grant us our wish, and place
the little Emily under our care, he would give us
grace in every respect to supply to her the place
of her departed parents, and to carry on that
Christian education which her mother had so
piously and successfully commenced. I prayed
also for myself and my husband, that when the
time of our departure should come, we might be
enabled to trust our cause to the Almighty, and
to say of ourselves, as the departed lady had said
of her child, “Our Redeemer is mighty, he will
plead our cause with thee.”
I waited by the corpse till I had, in some de-
gree, recovered my composure: then kissing its
cold forehead, I gave some few directions to the
old woman, and returned home.

206 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
On my arrival, I enquired eagerly after Emily.
She was awake, and was sitting on Mr. Graham's
knee, with her head resting on his shoulder, while
he was most kindly endeavouring to comfort her.
She received me with sweet affection, and asked
me if she might not go back and sit by her mam-
ma till she was laid in the grave. I endeavoured
to persuade her not to think of such a thing.
“It would make me happy,” she said. “O!
dear Mrs. Graham, let me go once again—let me
kiss my mamma's hand only once more!”
I did not know what to say, or how to talk with
her on the subject; but I rather put her off, for
the present, than absolutely refused her request.
I took her in my arms, and held her to my
heart, and spoke to her of dolls and playthings,
which I would send for her from London. But
in the midst of all this, to which she seemed to
have listened from politeness rather than interest,
she said, “ C Ma'am! talk to me of mamma.-
Where is my mamma now? Is she with papa
and my little sister? and are they all with my
Saviour? Are they clothed in his righteousness?
Is my mamma very fair now? is there no spot or
stain of sin about her? Please, Ma'am, to talk
to me about these things.”
How could I talk to her about what I did not
understand? I was not acquainted with religious

subjects: I feared, even before this child, to shew
my ignorance; so I said, “My dear, my heart is
so heavy and sad, that I cannot talk.”
“Please then to read the Bible, dear Ma'am ;
read about our Saviour;” she answered. “I think
that will comfort me; the Bible tells about heaven.”
“I will, my dear child,” I said, “I will read
the Bible, and Mr. Graham will read it also, if
you will but stay with us, and not want to go
away: and we will serve God together; and, with
God's help, we will prepare ourselves for that time
when we shall all go to be united with your dear
parents in the house of our Saviour above.”
She seemed pleased with this, and said, “Shall
I never leave you, Ma'am?”
“No, never, never, my sweet child,” I said,
“so long as God will allow us to dwell together.”
“Will you love me, Ma'am!” she replied:
“please to love me.”
“Love you! I have always loved you,” I an-
swered, “and now I shall be your mamma.”
“Mamma!” she said, “no, not my mamma—
you shall not be my mamma—my mamma is
dead; but you shall be my aunt, my own aunt,
my darling aunt, and I will never, never leave you.”


## p. 208 (#220) ############################################

208 THE GOVERN ESS; OR, THE
In saying this she clasped her arms closely
round my neck, and broke out afresh into tears.
After this conversation, the dear child became
evidently more composed. In the evening, how-
ever, her fatigue returned, having, as I found, had
nothing but disturbed nights for some time past.
I confided her to the care of my own maid, a
well-disposed and respectable young woman;
whom I directed to sleep with her, and tenderly
to sooth her as often as she might awake and call
for her mother, which she was in the habit of fre-
quently doing for some time after she came to live
with us.
I was exceedingly uneasy till the relation arriv-
ed to whom the posthumous letter of poor Mrs.
Norton had been sent, lest, on his arrival, he
should be disposed to remove Emily from us.
But we found him so far from making any objec-
tion to our keeping her, that he expressed himself
very happy in discovering that his little kinswo-
man, as he called her, had fallen into such good
hands; by which it was easy to perceive, that he
meant, into the hands of persons so able to pro-
vide for her.
We asked him how it had happened, that Mrs.
Norton, who appeared to have been a woman of
respectable family, was left to die in such obscurity.
He replied, that her husband was an officer,

with little private fortune, who had fallen in the
late campaign on the continent; leaving her with
only a small pension: that her rich, relations had
offered her a situation in one of their families,
which she had declined, choosing rather to live
in obscurity, and devote herself to the education
of her little daughter.
This was the only account which I could get of
my sweet Emily's parents; and the only worldly
goods which she inherited from them, was her
father's picture, her mother's watch, and the
Bible which I had seen.
We thought it better, if possible, to prevent
Emily's seeing her mother's remains again, as even
the mention of her name so affected the child as
sometimes quite to disorder her. The day of the
poor lady's funeral was therefore kept secret from
her little daughter: and almost immediately after
it, Mr. Graham not finding his health improve so
rapidly as could be wished, we gave up our
present situation, and, crossing the country, took
a house on the sea-shore in a little village in
Wales.
Here Mr. Graham's health was greatly restored;
and here our sweet Emily, after the manner of
children, soon regained her former vivacity. Yet
though, from her sprightly manner and very af-
fectionate deportment towards those about her, it
might seem that she had ceased to think of her
T 3

parents and her little sister; this was not really
the case, for the recollection of them was never
effaced from her mind. Past scenes and former
tender endearments were frequently brought to
her remembrance, by certain little delicate asso-
ciations of which I could at first form no idea; so
that I was often surprised when, in the midst of
a calm conversation, or a country walk, her coun-
tenance would suddenly change, and her eyes fill
with tears which could not be suppressed. But,
what especially shews the power and importance
of early religious instruction, she seemed never to
think of her dear departed friends, without having
her mind immediately raised towards God: inso-
much that her lamentations for the death of her
parents, and her early separation from her sister,
were regularly followed by expressions of grati-
tude to that Saviour, through the merits of whose
death she looked to a happy and eternal reunion
with them.
Mr. Graham and I, by God's blessing, perceiv-
ed the loveliness of this little girl's character, and
what it might become, if so fair an outline should
ever be adequately filled up. We earnestly, I
trust, and sincerely, wished to do our duty to-
wards her. But Mr. Graham, who was an ac-
curate observer, made me sensible, that flattery
might soon destroy that beautiful Christian sim-
plicity which adversity had in some measure as-
sisted to produce; by which means he kindly re-
strained my overweening fondness, and taught me

to refrain my lips from indiscreet commenda-
tion.
We remained, during the whole of that summer
and autumn, in the country: whence returning to
London in the winter, we lived in much greater re-
tirement than we had formerly done; Mr. Graham
finding, from the experience of several past months,
that he was most happy in the bosom of his own
family.
My mornings were devoted to the instruction of
Emily, and our evenings to reading. The events
of the last summer had given a serious turn to
our thoughts; and that love for the Bible which
our little adopted daughter brought with her into
our family, had led us to read it more frequently
than in former days, partly, for the purpose of
satisfying her, and, partly, with the desire of in-
creasing our own acquaintance with it. We now
also began to take delight in other religious books;
while our attendance on the outward observances
of religion became less a mere matter of form than
it once had been. Yet I mean not to boast; since
all this time, I may truly say, that my growth in
grace was exceeding slow, my backslidings very
many, and my love of the world continually inter-
fering with my religious duties.
Eight years had now passed away since Emily
entered our family—eight years of uncommon
happiness, perhaps of more happiness than was

212 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
consistent with our spiritual good. But why do
I say, perhaps, when this was certainly the case;
seeing that this is not our rest. (Micah ii. 10.)
Therefore the Lord leads us from this towards a
better resting-place, as an eagle stirreth up her nest,
jluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her
wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings.
(Deut. xxxii. 11.) In this state it became neces-
sary to make us feel, that the present world was
not our home, not our abiding-place.
Our dear Emily had attained her fifteenth year,
growing up, under the blessing of God, an exceed-
ing lovely young woman. Never did I see, in any
young person, vivacity so tempered with an abid-
ing fear of God, or natural and acquired endow-
ments so sweetly shaded by Christian humility.
Though she described herself to be (and that
truly) a miserable sinner, in whom, naturally, dwelt
no good thing; yet her conversation and deport-
ment displayed so much of the beauty of holiness,
that we could not but feel assured, that her bosom
was indeed become the abode of that Holy Spirit,
from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and
all just works do proceed.
At the age of fifteen, her mind seemed to take
even a still more serious turn. She became also
at this period more anxious for my spiritual wel-
fare, and that of Mr. Graham. At the same time
her health beginning visibly to decline, she ex-
pressed her decided opinion, that she should short-

ly leave this present evil world, and enter into
everlasting rest.
Whenever she spoke on this subject, it affected
me greatly; though I could not bring my mind to
think it possible that I should be so soon deprived
of my darling. The probability however of such
an event became gradually more apparent. The
insidious disease which had unexpectedly assailed
her, continued to gain ground; yet, so slowly, that
for a year and a half we were deluded with the
hope of her recovery. At length all hope was re-
moved, and we were brought suddenly to see that
we must speedily make up our minds to part with
our lovely child. This proved a grievous trial
of that faith, which I had for some time supposed
to be thoroughly confirmed. I lately imagined
that my mountain stood strong: (Psalm xxx. 7.)
yet no sooner had the Lord prepared a worm to
smite my gourd, than I fainted, like Jonah, and
said, “It would be better for me to die than to
live.” (Jonah iv. 7, 8.)
Mr. Graham behaved more like a Christian on
this occasion than I did: he submitted more pa-
tiently to the will of God, and was sooner ena-
bled to say, “My God, not my will, but thine,
be done.” But I will pass rapidly over this part
of my history.
The growth in grace of our dear child was
especially apparent to every eye during the last


## p. 214 (#226) ############################################

214 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
weeks of her life. A few hours before she was
seized with the last mortal pangs, she, in the most
solemn and affecting manner, thanked Mr Graham
and myself for all our kindness, expressing her
affection for us as for very dear parents; and as-
suring us, that her feelings at that moment were
not stronger for her natural parents, than for us
her adopted father and mother. She then pro-
ceeded to exhort us, in a manner which I hope
will never be forgotten, to a serious concern for
our immortal souls. She pressed upon us the
important doctrine of our natural depravity, and
consequent utter incapacity of helping ourselves.
She next spoke of the Saviour: and on this sub-
ject all her accustomed warmth of feeling, with
all her usual vivacity of thought, were called
forth in praise of Him, who is altogether lovely,
and the fairest among ten thousand. She en-
treated us to hold fast the profession of our faith
without wavering; reminding us how little the
world could give, in comparison of that happiness
which is laid up for the faithful: after which she
proceeded, in a manner inexpressibly affecting, to
point out the pleasure which she conceived to
await us on our reunion in the presence of our
adorable Redeemer. Here, however, her feelings
overcame her dying frame, and her lovely face
sunk upon my bosom, as I sat supporting her in
my arms. But the subject becomes too affecting.
—Oh, my Emily' my Emily' child of my tender-
est affection! beloved of thy Saviour ! thou art
removed to a happier world; while I am left be-

reaved of the delight of mine eyes, and the idol of
my affections.
I perhaps loved this amiable young woman
more than was right, bestowing upon the creature
what was due only to the Creator. But I stand
reproved, and, I hope, submissive to the will of
God. Yet, although several years are passed
away since I lost my Emily, my wounds continue
to bleed; and I still find it necessary to pray for
a more entire submission to the divine will.
But I hasten to shut up this painful relation.
I have performed the task assigned me by your
friendship; and I shall probably hereafter rejoice
that I have had power to execute it. I could
add much more, but dare no longer expatiate on
this subject. I therefore close my letter with an
earnest prayer—that my will may be brought into
a complete subjection to that of my almighty Fa-
ther.
M. GRAHAM.
When Miss Jenny Peace had reached the con-
ciusion of this distressing story, all the young
people remained silent; not one word was spoken;
nor indeed, for some moments, could any one of
the party articulate a word: every eye was filled
with tears, and some even sobbed aloud. At
length Miss Dolly Friendly, bursting into a flood
of tears, exclaimed, “O lovely, lovely Emily! I
am sure that if I had been Mrs. Graham, I should

have been just like her, and should have loved my
Emily too much.”
“But, my dear Miss Dolly,” replied Miss
Jenny, wiping away her tears, “I have heard my
governess, and also my poor mamma, very fre-
quently affirm, that whenever we prefer the crea-
ture to the Creator, however lovely or excellent
that creature may be, we commit a great sin: and
in such a case there is reason to believe, that the
Almighty will, in his mercy, remove the object of
our excessive affection, in order that we may free-
ly give our hearts to Him who alone is worthy of
our entire devotion and love.”
'Here their conversation was interrupted by the
bell ringing for supper; on which the young peo-
ple all hastened into the house. Mrs. Teachum
was rather pleased than disconcerted at the proofs
of sensibility which she observed on their faces
at this season, readily guessing the occasion of
that appearance. She however took no notice of
the matter at that time.
After supper, the little party having attended
divine service, retired to their beds; where they
spent their time, till they fell asleep, in thinking
of the lovely Emily, and considering how far they
themselves were inferior to that extraordinary
child. -

SATURDAY,
The ninth Day.
|EARLY on the morrow, after morning prayers,
which Mrs. Teachum never failed to offer every
day in the school-room, the little company took a
walk in the garden while breakfast was prepar-
ing. The fine weather, and the beautiful prospects
around them, all united to increase their pleasure.
They looked upon one another with delight, while
every object in nature reminded them of that God
to whom they owed their happiness, and whose
love for them they had lately been taught to con-
sider as unquestionable, since he had given such
a proof of his tender regard for the whole sinful
race of man, as never was or could be given by
one earthly friend to another: For God so loved
the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
but have everlasting life. (John iii. 16.)
Miss Jenny Peace could not here refrain from
remarking, that they were happier than any other
society of children whatever.
Miss Dolly Friendly replied, “And all our

happiness, my dear Miss Jenny, is owing to
you.”
Miss Jenny answered, “I thank you, Miss
Dolly, for your kind opinion of me: and yet, my
beloved friend, I should be better pleased to hear
you give the glory where alone it is due; not unto
me, but unto God.”
Miss Dolly made no answer, but looked serious;
when Miss Jenny added, while she held out her
hand to her in an affectionate manner, “In all
our intercourse with each other, Miss Dolly, we
must remember that we are sinful creatures, and
if saved at all, must be saved as brands plucked
out of the fire: and this recollection should make
us very sparing in the use of flattering expressions
one to another, which generally tend to mislead
and injure us. True affection always seeks the
good of its object, not merely its present, but its
eternal good.”
Miss Dolly Friendly blushed, and confessed that
her feelings often ran away with her on such oc-
casions, inclining her to testify her regard for
those she loved in an improper manner.
Miss Jenny Peace kissed her tenderly, and beg-
ged her to pardon the liberty which she had taken
in speaking her mind with so much freedom.
Miss Dolly Friendly had scarcely time to assure


## p. 219 (#231) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 219
her that she not only forgave her, but heartily
thanked her for what she had said, before Mrs.
Teachum appeared on the steps of the hall-door,
calling the children to her. They ran towards
her in haste. In her hand she held an open note
which she had just received; and as her counte-
nance appeared peculiarly smiling and pleasant,
the young people were made to hope that she had
something agreeable to communicate to them:
nor were they disappointed, since the note came
from a lady living in the neighbourhood, request-
ing Mrs. Teachum to bring her young ladies in the
afternoon, to drink tea with her. This lady's house
was situated about a mile and a half from Mrs.
Teachum's, in the centre of a beautiful wood,
which was distinctly seen from the windows of the
school-room. She was a lady of high rank and
title, a widow, and without children; but of so
great an age, that, although she perfectly en-
joyed all her faculties, yet she had not been
able to leave her house for many years. She
saw little company; but being truly pious, she
was always anxious to do good, forming and
executing many plans with that view. She was
not personally acquainted with Mrs. Teachum;
but having been told how anxious this excel-
lent woman was to bring up her young ladies in
the fear of God, she sent to request their com-
pany, with the intent of affording the young la-
dies pleasure, and encouraging them to proceed
in that sacred path which leads to the truest hap-
piness. -


## p. 220 (#232) ############################################

220 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
After reading the invitation in an audible voice,
Mrs. Teachum kindly promised the little party,
that, if they behaved well, she should have great
pleasure in presenting them to the noble lady who
had done them this honour. The young ladies
were greatly delighted, and hastened to the
school-room to begin, without loss of time, the
tasks which their governess had appointed them.
And, I am happy to say, that they all worked with
willing hearts and hands: insomuch that they had
completed their work before dinner was announ-
ced, although Mrs. Teachum had ordered it
to be ready half an hour sooner than usual, for
the purpose of giving them full time to prepare
for their walk; as the Lady Faulconbridge (for
such was the name of this venerable person) had
requested that they would come early.
About two o'clock the happy little party were
assembled in the hall, all neatly dressed, each in
a silk slip, with a lawn apron and lace tucker,
and wearing a small cap with a narrow border of
lace neatly quilled round it. Each of the young
ladies had a rose-bud and a sprig of jessamine in
her bosom, and each held in her hand a silk hood
and tippet, ready to put on as soon as their go-
verness should appear.
Mrs. Teachum, who was always very punctual
to her appointments, soon came into the hall;
and having looked at her little pupils, one by one,
to satisfy herself that they were decently habited,


## p. 221 (#233) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 221
she exhorted them all to remember those rules of
Christian courtesy, which she had often laid be-
fore them; namely, to be kindly affectioned one
to another with brotherly love; in honour pre-
ferring one another: (Rom. xii. 10.) to render to
all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;
custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; and
honour to whom honour. (Rom. xiii. 7.) After
this short admonition, she directed Miss Jenny
Peace and Miss Sukey Jennett to lead the way,
while she herself walked last, leading little Miss
Polly Suckling by the hand.
It happened very fortunately, as the weather
was extremely hot, that most of their way lay
through shady lanes and under hedgerows, now
richly adorned with wild honeysuckles and roses,
till they came into the deeper shade of Lady
Faulconbridge's wood, through which they had
nearly a mile to walk.
At the entrance of the wood, Mrs. Teachum
looking at her watch, and finding that she was a
little too early, proposed that they should all sit
down on the trunk of a tree, which had been
lately felled, and which was then lying on one
side of the way. The little party were in so
cheerful and contented a state of mind, that every
thing appeared sweet and delightful to them; so
with a general smile they sat down upon the
rustic seat to which Mrs. Teachum had invited
them.

222 THE GOVERNEss; OR, THE
While they remained in this place, they had op-
portunity of observing many things which greatly
pleased them. They saw two little squirrels in
an opposite tree, sitting on one of the boughs,
holding something in their fore paws, which they
lifted to their mouths just as a human creature
would do, while their tails, adorned with long
hair, were raised up behind them as high as their
heads. But upon one of the children moving,
the pretty animals started and ran away, which
set all the little merry company a-laughing.
The air in this place was filled with the per-
fume of flowers; and here and there the blue-
bells grew so thickly under the trees, that the
ground appeared to be quite enamelled with them.
In other places the many-coloured vetch with the
wood-anemone afforded a beautiful variety, rais-
ing the one its gay and the other its delicate head
from among the thick moss. Mrs. Teachum
made her little girls to observe all these beautiful
works of God; pointing out to them how in the
wilderness, where no man dwelleth, the Lord
satisfies the desolate and waste ground with the
rain from heaven, and causes the bud of the ten-
der herb to spring forth. (Job xxxviii. 26, 27.)
From hence too, copying the example of our
blessed Saviour, she proceeded to draw this use-
ful lesson—that, as God Almighty supplies even
the wants of each little flower of the forest, he
will assuredly much more supply both the bodily

and spiritual wants of those who love and trust
him. “Therefore,” added she, “my dear chil-
dren, apply to your God and Saviour for assist-
ance to behave well and to do good. Remember
these little flowers, how beautiful are their forms,
how bright their colours, and how sweet their
breath; and do you, my dears, pray to be made
equally lovely—becoming gentle, obliging, cour-
teous, modest, and, like these flowers, capable of
adorning the several stations to which God shall
appoint you.”
So saying, Mrs. Teachum rose up, when they
all walked forward, and soon came in sight of the
Lady Faulconbridge's house. It was situated in
the lowest part of the wood, and the descent to
it was very considerable. It was a very large
though not a lofty house, formed partly of black
timbers, the ends of the beams being carved into
many grotesque figures, representing the heads of
dragons, lions, and sphinxes. The doors and
windows were pointed or arched, the doors being
set with bosses of iron, and many of the windows
filled with painted glass. The house was sur-
rounded with a flower-garden, laid out in formal
parterres, each alley being terminated with a yew
tree seat, and the whole inclosed with a high wall.
Mrs. Teachum now walked first, and finding the
garden-door open, she proceeded to the entrance
of the house; where, having pulled a bell, the
door was opened by an old man-servant, who led

224 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
the party through a very large hall, at each end
of which was a grand oak staircase, to a large
parlour, adorned with china boxes and cabinets,
and hung with many pictures. At the upper end
of this room, near an open window, sat the Lady
Faulconbridge. This lady had the appearance of
extreme old age. She had lost all her teeth, and
her mouth was so much fallen in, that her nose
and chin projected towards each other. Her face
was extremely wrinkled and yellow. She wore a
black silk dress, with a large hoop, a little plaited
lace-cap and hood, with long lace ruffles, which
hanging round her thin arms, made them appear
still more emaciated. Her manners however were
exceedingly pleasing; and as she looked through
her glass at the young people, she smiled upon
each of them in a peculiarly sweet and gracious
manner. She very politely begged Mrs. Teachum
to sit down, and asked the young ladies if they
would like to amuse themselves in the hall or gar-
den till tea-time. They looked at Mrs. Teachum
for her approbation, and having each made a low
courtesy, they withdrew into the hall; where, re-
quiring rest after their walk, they placed them-
selves in a window-seat till they should be called
to tea.
Here they were much amused by a parrot,
which being seated on a perch in a corner of the
hall, scolded and talked to them in a loud shrill
voice. One of the young ladies was about to
answer the parrot, and to provoke the creature


## p. 225 (#237) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 225
to prate more loudly, as she said, for the general
amusement. But Miss Jenny Peace intimating
that such behaviour would be extremely impolite,
bade her remember the pretty flowers in the wood,
which were content to adorn each the little spot
in which it was planted: she then proceeded to
extol the charms of modesty and inoffensiveness
in a little female. The young lady blushed, and
running to Miss Jenny Peace, kissed her affection-
ately, while a tear dropped from her eye on Miss
Jenny's bosom.
Being now called to tea, they walked into the
parlour in a pretty and modest manner, accord-
ing to their several ages, courtseying low at the
door. They then took their seats at some little
distance from the tea-table, without noise or con-
fusion, as they were directed by the elderly ser-
vant. A lady whom they had not seen before, a
friend of the Lady Faulconbridge, was engaged in
making the tea.
While they were sitting at tea, and the Lady
Faulconbridge was talking to Mrs. Teachum, the
attention of the little party was greatly attracted
by a large picture which hung on the opposite
wall, and in so good a light, that every part of it
was seen to advantage, and appeared exceedingly
beautiful. It represented a very handsome lady .
sitting in an open alcove. The lady wore a rich
silk dress, extremely full, with loose sleeves, and
a kind of tippet of fine lace. Her glossy hair was

dressed flat on the top of her head, hanging in
curls down her neck, and richly adorned with jew-
els. Notwithstanding however the natural beauty
of this lady, there was a haughtiness of aspect
about her which much struck the little observers,
and made them turn continually, with more de-
light, to the figure of a little girl of about eight
years of age, who was ascending the steps of the
alcove, looking up to the lady who sat within.
The dress of this little girl resembled that of the
lady, with this difference only, that she wore a
fine lace-cap instead of jewels on her head; and
in her hand she held an open book, written with-
in, The Holy Bible. This little girl was perhaps
not so regularly beautiful as the lady who sat in
the alcove; but her complexion was delicately
fair, while her sweet countenance indicated an
habitual and pious composure mixed with some
little degree of awe of the lady to whom she was
looking up. Through the open pillars of the alcove
(for the picture was very large) was seen in per-
spective a highly ornamented country, presenting
open lawns on which deer were feeding, inter-
spersed with lofty groves of trees.
It was not to be wondered at, that this picture,
produced by the best painter of that age, and be-
ing in every respect exceedingly beautiful, should
so entirely attract the attention of our young peo-
ple, that the greater part of them could attend to
nothing else, scarcely hearing a single syllable of
the conversation which passed in the room. The

Lady Faulconbridge observed what it was that
drew their attention; so when the tea-things were
removed, and the servants were withdrawn, “My
dear young ladies,” she said, “you have been
looking very earnestly, I see, at the picture which
hangs just before you: will you tell me what
pleases you most in it?”
Being somewhat embarrassed by this question,
the young ladies turned towards Mrs. Teachum,
who assured them that they might speak without
fear of giving offence, since the Lady Faulcon-
bridge had honoured them by asking their opi-
nion.
Miss Jenny Peace then, in the name of the rest,
replied, “We think the lady in the alcove very
beautiful; but we are more charmed with the
figure of that lovely little girl.”
The tears came into Lady Faulconbridge's eyes
on hearing the remark of Miss Jenny; to which
she returned this answer: “My dear young ladies,
I am pleased with your opinion; your judgment
is correct. That lovely child was indeed a child
of God, and in her countenance you may see
something of the beauty of holiness: and since I
have reason to think that what I am going to do
may prove useful to you, I am willing, though it
may cost me some pain, to repeat to you the his-
tory of that lovely child, who was lent to her pa-
rents for a very little while, as a sweet messenger

to call them to heaven; and who now, being dead,
yet speaketh.”
Here the Lady Faulconbridge paused for a few
minutes, wiping the tears from her aged eyes—
neither was there any one in the room who could
refuse to shed a tear with her, beginning now to
apprehend that this child, over which the vene-
rable lady wept, was indeed her own, and had
been long lost to her.
The History of the Lady Faulconbridge and her
Children.
“ALTHOUGH I am now,” said the Lady Faul-
conbridge, “so decrepid and melancholy an ob-
ject, I was once represented by the lady sitting in
the alcove. You look earnestly at me, my young
friends, and perhaps are trying in vain to trace
some resemblance between me and that picture:
but you will be less surprised at the change you
observe, when I tell you that above fifty years are
passed since yonder portrait was taken, and that I
was then only thirty years of age. My life has
been protracted to a great length; I have long
survived every individual of my family, and have
spent many years confined by infirmities to this
house. But I bless God for every affliction with
which I have been exercised; I have not received
one stroke too much from my heavenly Father.
I have, during my long life, enjoyed many com-

forts; and my latter days have been blessed with
the sweet hope of an everlasting union in the
world to come with Him who died for me, and,
through Him, of being reunited to that husband
and those dear children, from whom I have been
so long separated. But to continue my relation.
“My father was a nobleman of high rank and
large fortune, residing almost constantly in the
court of our gracious sovereign King Charles the
Second. I was the youngest of my father's chil-
dren, the most beloved, and thought to be the
most beautiful among them, although all my sis-
ters were handsome. We were brought up in ex-
traordinary pride, and consequently acquired that
love of gaiety and pleasure with which all the
court was then infected.
“When I was fifteen years of age our sovereign
died, and we retired from court till the arrival of
William Prince of Orange and Queen Mary. We
then returned to court, where I was made one of
her majesty's maids of honour, a station which I
occupied only a few months; for the Lord Faul-
conbridge looking upon me with a favourable eye,
and demanding me of my father, I shortly after-
wards, with the queen's consent, became his wife.
“My husband was at that time a young and
gay man, having little sense of religion, and pos-
sessing a high degree of pride. I was little more
than nineteen on my marriage, and was extremely

haughty, uncommonly vain of my beauty, a lover
of pomp and pleasure, and eagerly seeking oppor-
tunities of displaying my accomplishments in public.
“It happened, that almost the whole of my
Lord's very large estates, excepting only those
which lie in this part of the country, were all en-
tailed on the male heir; that is,” added the venera-
ble lady, wishing to make the matter clear to her
young auditors, “it was so ordered by law, that if
my Lord had no son, he had not the power to leave
his estates either to me or to his daughters. It
appeared therefore of great consequence to us both
that we should have a son: but we had been mar-
ried nearly three years, before there was a prospect
of our having any children. This circumstance
fretted my Lord, and made me extremely impatient.
At length there appeared a probability of our hav-
ing a child—a son we were determined it should
be, and I caused the most superb baby-linen to be
prepared for our little heir, as we doubted not it
would prove. But at length, when the time of the
baby's birth arrived, the nurse presented me with
a little girl; that same sweet child, whose picture
you have now before you.
“Such was my disappointment and mortifica-
tion at this event, that I turned with disgust from
the harmless infant, and desired it might be taken
from my presence. My nurse and maid expos-
tulated with me, telling me that the baby was de-
licate and small, and that, in all probability, it

could not be reared without its mother's milk.
Upon this I grew so violent, that, fearing to en-
danger my life, they removed the baby from me;
though not till I had given orders for a proper
nurse to be procured for the support of the child.
“My faithful maid being more anxious for the
life of my baby than its unnatural mother, was so
indefatigable in her enquiries after a nurse, that be-
fore night she procured one, as it appeared, every
way proper. This nurse was the widow of an
officer killed in battle only a few months before,
and who had lately been delivered of an infant
which died a few hours after its birth, living only
to receive the blessings of our holy church upon
earth, and then going to be made for ever happy
in heaven, through the imputed righteousness of
Him in whom is the offer of life unto all. (1 Cor.
xv. 22.)
“This bereaved wife and mother was brought to
our house, where an apartment was appropriated
to her, and where she received my little one into
her bosom, bestowing upon her the tenderest ca-
resses. To this little girl we gave the name of Lu-
cy: but we seldom spoke of her, except as of one
whose existence was a misfortune to her parents;
although a lovelier baby was perhaps never seen.
“Thus you perceive, my little Misses, how the
heart may be hardened, and the sweetest ties of
nature broken, by the indulgence of any evil pas-

sion. Pride was the ruling passion, both of my-
self and my husband; and hence the fear of not
having a son to inherit our honours, made us even
hate the name of daughter.
“As soon as I was able to go out after the birth
of my child, I returned into public, appeared
at court, and devoted my whole time to the plea-
sures of the world. But before the expiration of
fourteen months, all our wishes were accomplished
by the birth of a son, whom we called Herbert,
and to whom I was not unwilling to perform the
part of a mother.
“My little Herbert was, like his sister, a lovely
child, having a graceful shape and a beautiful
countenance. As these children grew older, Her-
bert was permitted to come into my presence when-
ever it suited him; but Lucy was only brought
before me once a-day, when she was taught to pay
her compliments formally, and to stand still till I
gave her permission to withdraw: and the greatest
favour I ever allowed her, was sometimes to kiss
my hand. -
“In this manner three or four years passed
away; the little Lucy still living in the retired
apartment of her nurse, who was now become her
governess, and of whom I required that she should
teach her fine needlework, a service which she
seemed very capable of performing; besides which
she was to see that the child was dressed with the

most curious neatness. Lucy's governess submit-
ted with the utmost willingness to all my com-
mands, appearing to consider nothing as an incon-
venience, nor to dread any possible event but that
of a separation from her little lady.
“At the end of the four years above mention-
ed,” continued the old Lady Faulconbridge, “my
Lord fancying that he was not so well received at
court as he had been, suddenly determined to re-
move, with his family, into the country. I was
exceedingly grieved at this resolution, considering
the pleasures of the town as indispensable to my
happiness; upon which I used every means to pre-
vail upon my Lord to remain at court: but not
being able to succeed, I was obliged, at length, to
submit to become an inhabitant of one of my
Lord's country residences. And O how happy
might I there have been, with my husband and my
beloved children, possessing all this world could
bestow, even to magnificence itself! but pride and
the love of pleasure empoisoned all my happiness.
“On our settling in the country, I became sul-
len and dejected: I refused to associate with my
country neighbours, and made myself so unplea-
sant to my Lord, that, in order to beguile the time,
he had recourse to field sports. He was now al-
most continually abroad, with his hounds and his
hunters; and when at home, he chiefly associated
with the companions of his sports, in whose com-
pany he acquired the habit of drinking freely.

At the same time, observing how improperly I in-
dulged my little son, he procured a tutor for him,
insisting that he should be with me only a few
hours every day. Thus neglected by my Lord,
and separated from my son, I considered myself
as the most miserable of human beings; not re-
flecting, that I was myself the author of all my
troubles, many of which were indeed merely ima-
ginary. I now spent much of my time in bed,
and the rest in reading romances, dressing, and
sauntering about my garden.
“The alcove represented in that painting was a
place where I often sat: it was at the end of a
broad straight gravel walk, which extended from
the grand front of the house to the park-gate,
commanding a view of the house and garden on
one side, and of the park on the other, adorned
with many beautiful groves of trees, a lake of clear
water, the village church and church-yard. To
this place, as I before said, I used often to resort
during the warm weather, where I spent my time
in reading such of my favourite romances, or books
of poetry, as tended to cherish a foolish and self-
ish melancholy.
“When we had occupied this retirement rather
more than three years, my little daughter's nurse
died, and was buried in the church-yard before
mentioned: after which I placed my daughter un-
der the charge of my maid, the same person who
had procured the nurse for her. My maid had

been brought up in a situation above her present
rank, and was a pious and faithful servant. She
had often endeavoured to insinuate good advice,
which, had I followed, would have saved me much
remorse and anguish; and now she took occasion
to expostulate with me concerning my conduct
towards my little daughter—She represented to
me, that she was an extremely lovely child, and
had been brought up by her affectionate nurse
and governess in such habits as, with the bless-
ing of Almighty God, would render her all that a
young lady of rank could be wished; being pious,
modest, gentle, intelligent, industrious, and withal
having a wonderful dignity and composure of de-
portment, together with a sweet and gracious man-
ner, calculated to set forth to the utmost advan-
tage all her other perfections. She informed me
how tenderly my little Lucy had watched by her
governess till the moment of death; and how she
had ever since mourned her loss, not by a noisy
grief, but with a deep and silent sorrow, which
she testified by a strict and solemn observance
of all her injunctions, as well as by an exact
preservation of those habits which she had in-
culcated—all these expostulations, my maid con-
cluded, by entreating me to cultivate the affec-
tion of this sweet child. “You complain, my
Lady,' she said, ‘of being alone; of having no
friend, no companion. O, permit your faith-
ful servant to persuade you to find the friend
and companion you want, in your little daugh-
ter.”

“I answered, haughtily, that a child could not
be made a suitable companion for me: and in
this manner the subject was dropped. I could
not however shake off the uneasy feelings which
this conversation had excited in me. The whole
unreasonable tenor of my conduct towards my
child was frequently brought to my recollection.
I even felt jealous of the regard which she testi-
fied for the memory of her nurse; while the merits
and fidelity of that excellent person, who had laid
upon me the highest possible obligation to grati-
tude which a mother could feel, filled me with
envy and dissatisfaction. -
“While I was in this state of mind, I went one
day to sit in my favourite alcove. It was a lovely
morning in the early part of the summer-season.
All nature was smiling around me; the roses and
jessamine in the garden breathed the most fra-
grant odours, and a gentle breeze waved the
branches of the trees in the park, under which
the deer were feeding. All about me was har-
mony and delight, while all within was discord
and dissatisfaction. I had made an idol of my-
self, and had received in myself that recompence
of my error which was meet; (Rom. i. 27.) for I
was completely miserable, dissatisfied with my-
self, and discontented with the whole world. I
held in my hand a romance, with which I endea-
voured to beguile the time. But as a person long
used to opiates, finds at length that they have lost
their efficacy, so I found, from a like cause, that

these dangerous books had become unable to al-
leviate, even for a moment, the uneasiness of my
feelings.
“While I was in this place, my little daughter
came out at the door of the house, dressed as you
see her in the picture. She descended the high
flight of steps, from time to time looking at the
book in her hand. And as she came forward
along the straight walk, she stopped several times
to gather flowers: but being evidently engaged
with her book, though not always looking upon
it, she did not perceive that I was in the alcove,
till her foot was upon the steps leading to it.
“On seeing me she started slightly; and while
the colour rose in her cheeks, which were in ge-
neral but faintly tinged with a slight bloom, she
begged my pardon for the intrusion, and was go-
ing away; when I called her back, and asked her,
no doubt, with my usual haughtiness, why she had
not seen me earlier that day? and why she did
not pay her usual compliments to me?
“At this undeserved reproof she turned again,
and approaching me with a sweet composure of
spirit, she kissed my extended hand, begging me
to excuse her apparent negligence, as she feared
to interrupt me, seeing I was reading.
“I made no other answer than to tell her she
was now at liberty to go. But while speaking,

my eye glanced upon the book which was open in
her hand, and which I perceived to be the Bible.
—The Bible! the Holy Book of God! was the
private and chosen study of my little daughter;
while her mother wasted her precious time in
reading romances !
“This thought, pressing very strongly upon my
mind, produced in me a very painful sensation of
shame, which, added to my other uneasy feelings,
made me burst into a violent fit of tears; while
my eye followed the lovely little creature, whose
character I now for the first time began to see
and admire.
“Along the mazes of the shrubbery she had,
it seems, intended to have passed through the al-
cove, as the shortest way into the park; but be-
ing intimidated by me, she took a winding course
among the shrubs of the pleasure-ground. In
several different places I caught a glimpse of her,
as she walked slowly on reading her Bible, or
stopped to gather flowers. Her little elegant
form and gentle aspect, still more softened by
distance, struck me in a manner they had never
done before: and indeed I had never before be-
held her with the eye of love. But God was at
that time beginning a work in me which will never
be finished until he present me unto himself, not
having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but
holy and without blemish. (Eph. v. 27.) O won-
derful work! O resurrection from death! O se-

cond creation!—by which one so vile and harden-
ed, so utterly corrupt, as I then was, was made
new in Christ Jesus! And although that work,
after fifty years, is still very imperfect; yet I feel
that He who called me is faithful, and will as-
suredly accomplish it in due season. (1 Thess.
v. 24.) But to return to my story.
“I lost sight of my Lucy for a little while, and
then again saw her passing the bottom of the park,
when I perceived that she was directing her steps
to the village church-yard. I now understood
the object of her walk—she was going to strew
flowers upon her nurse's grave. I saw her pass
through the little wicket, where the trees in the
church-yard hid her from my view. How long it
was before she appeared again I cannot tell; for
in that interval, be it long, or be it short, such
things passed in my mind as can never be forgot-
ten. All my sinful negligence and cruelty towards
this lovely child were brought before me with an
order and force, which I must ever attribute to an
immediate divine influence: for the word of God
is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing
asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart. (Heb. iv. 12.)
“I remained lost in painful thoughts till I saw
my little girl come out of the church-yard, and
return towards the house. It was now distress-

ing to me, to see how carefully she avoided the
alcove in her way to the house. I traced her
steps as she sometimes appeared in view in a dis-
tant part of the pleasure-grounds, till at length I
saw her enter the door. I then broke out in the
anguish of my heart to this purpose: ‘O my
sweet Lucy! lovely and holy child! how unwor-
thy am I to be called thy mother! Thy real
mother now sleeps in the dust; 'tis she who now
lies in the grave whom thy heart acknowledges to
be such—she was thy mother, thy instructress,
thy truest friend.’
“I remained in the alcove weeping, bitterly
weeping, till the hour of dinner drawing near, and
expecting some strangers to be present, I hasten-
ed to wash away my tears, to change my dress,
and to affect a composure I little felt.
“The next morning, after a very uneasy night,
I opened my heart to my maid, telling her that
I had resolved to change my conduct towards
my little girl, and begging that she would im-
mediately bring her to me. I was sitting on a
couch in my dressing-room when she was intro-
duced. Her manner, as usual, was composed
and graceful; and she stopped at some distance
from me, courtseying low, as she had been taught.
“‘Lucy,' I said, ‘come near to me.’ I then
hesitated; for I really felt awkward and ashamed.
I held out my hand. She came forward and kiss-

ed it, looking anxiously at me, not being able to
guess what was passing in my mind.
“‘Lucy,' I said, “can you love me as you loved
your nurse?’
“Her face flushed high at the name of her
nurse, and the tears started into her eyes. She
tried to speak, but could not.
“I clasped my arms round her, and kissed her.
“Lucy, my child,' I said, ‘ can you love me? will
you love me? Will you be to me what you were
to your nurse?’
“She burst into tears, and pressed her sweet
cheek against mine, answering, in a low soft voice,
‘Will you allow me, Madam?”
“But the time will not permit me,” said the
Lady Faulconbridge, “to enter into every parti-
cular of my story which may seem interesting and
affecting to myself. Suffice it to say, that after
this interview my little Lucy became my familiar
associate, while I shewed myself as impetuous,
and eager, and injudicious in my regard for her,
as I had before been cold and backward. In a
word, this sweet child now became my constant
companion, my darling idol, and the object of all
my foolish attentions and flatteries. I extolled her
beauty; I had the first artists from London to
draw her likeness; taking a strange delight in

adorning her with jewels and other vain ornaments:
and assuredly I should have destroyed the good
effects of all her nurse's endeavours to lead her in
the heavenly way, had not the work been of God,
and her pious instructress only a humble instru-
ment in his hands—but that work being truly di-
vine, could not be destroyed.
“Under all these trials of high prosperity my
lovely child preserved her former sweet composure,
with all her usual pure and pious habits. Her
Bible was her daily delight, and she frequently
asked permission to read it to me, as a divine di-
rectory to everlasting happiness. Her manner to-
wards me never lost any of its former respectful-
ness, but became sweetly tempered with love: nor
did she ever express any recollection of my former
cold neglect, so that I sometimes even doubted
whether she had been aware of it. Towards her
little brother also her manner was indescribably
amiable; and her endeavours to lead him in the
right way were so earnest, and so highly blessed,
that he often assured me, after the lapse of many
years, that his first views of religion had been re-
ceived from his sister.”
The Lady Faulconbridge now paused for a mo-
ment, to wipe away a tear that was trickling down
her aged cheek; after which she proceeded to the
following effect: “I had enjoyed the sweet affec-
tion of my pleasant child rather less than a year,
when she was attacked with a slight fever. From

this however she seemed soon to recover: but a
cough shortly afterwards succeeding it, she began,
though at first almost imperceptibly, to fade away.
She became thin, the colour left her cheeks, and
her lips appeared pale. I observed these symp-
toms at first without much alarm; but a remark
made in my presence, though not intended to
reach my ears, not only filled me with anguish,
but excited in me such a degree of apprehension,
that I immediately sent for the best medical as-
sistance which could be procured. This remark,
so replete with terrors for me, was, that the sick-
ness which had brought Lady Lucy's nurse to her
grave, after beginning with the same symptoms
as those then apparent on my beloved child, had
ended in a confirmed and hopeless consumption.
“Had my beloved child been threatened with
any other death, I felt that I could have borne it
better: but in this I saw the direct and immediate
punishment of my own criminal negligence, and
that at a time when I supposed my sin to be for-
gotten. I knew too well how liable children are
to partake of the constitution of their nurses; nei-
ther could any one induce me to think, after the
dreadful hint I had heard, that if my child died, it
would not, in all probability, be in consequence of
my not having fulfilled the part of a mother to her.
No care, no skill, no tears, no prayers, were al-
lowed by the Almighty to arrest the progress of
that fatal disease which had seized upon our Lucy,
and which proceeded so rapidly in its dreadful

course, that towards the end of autumn we were
called to resign our lovely child to the silent tomb.
“During this illness our gentle Lucy visibly
grew in grace, sweetly drawing comfort for me and
her afflicted father from the only fountain of true
consolation, and exhorting us to seek that Saviour
through whose tender love and sufferings, she,
though a feeble and sinful child of Adam, was en-
abled to subdue the fear of death.
“When once, in an agony of mind, I mentioned
to her my persuasion, that she had derived from
her nurse the seeds of that disease which was then
effecting the destruction of her mortal part, and
that had I but performed a mother's duty towards
her at that early period, she might have been
spared to us for many years—she raised herself in
her bed, and lifting up her eyes to heaven, affect-
ingly exclaimed, ‘I thank thee, O my God, for
thou hast done all things well.' Then turning to
me, she continued, “O my beloved mother! take
this for your comfort—that if I drew the seeds of
temporal death from my beloved nurse, she was
made the means also of leading me into an ac-
quaintance with him who is the Resurrection and
the Life. It was she, my dear Madam, who very
early in life, even as long ago as I can remember,
pointed out to me the Saviour, and implored for
me, with many earnest prayers, the blessings of
the new covenant.” She then embraced me, and
besought me, in a more earnest manner than she

had ever done before, to forsake the pursuit of
worldly pleasures, and to devote myself wholly to
God. ‘Our beloved Saviour,” she said, “is now
drawing you, my dear mother; he is drawing you
at once by tender love and gentle chastisements.
O run after him; he will bring you into his cham-
bers, and comfort you with his love.’ (Sol. Song
i. 4.)
“My beloved child did not live long after this
conversation, but passed sweetly through the grave
and gate of death into her Saviour's bosom. Be-
fore, however, that awful moment arrived she re-
quested, that she might be buried by the side of
her nurse. I at first objected; but my Lord in-
sisted, that this last favour required by a child
lately become so dear to him, should not be de-
nied. Accordingly the grave of our Lucy's nurse
was opened, and her little coffin placed beside that
of her early guardian. We erected over them a
superb marble monument, upon which the names of
both were engraven, with the dates of their death.
“After the loss of my little girl I sunk into a
deep melancholy. My Lord, who partook of my
sorrow, was exceedingly kind to me, and gave up
many of his field sports and amusements in order
to devote his time to me. He allowed me also to
enjoy more of my little boy's company; while the
last exhortations of our departed darling were cer-
tainly neither unfelt, nor unattended by a divine
blessing. -

“The Scriptures now became a chief part of
our studies, and we attended all the public ordi-
nances of religion with more than usual exactness.
But my Lord's advance in the Christian life was
evidently more rapid than mine, and the exem-
plary death of his little girl was rendered more
especially profitable to him.
“When a few years had abated my grief, I ceas-
ed to think so much of my Lucy, and began
again to make an idol of my son, who was growing
a fine youth, and discovered a serious inclination
to the service of God. I now began to look for-
ward to the time when he would make a figure
in the world, and promised myself much happiness
in seeing him become the father of a family, among
whom I might perhaps behold another Lucy.
These prospects insensibly drew me from my re-
ligious thoughts; thus making the loss of many
other earthly comforts necessary to the admission
of the Saviour into my ungrateful heart.
“My son, as he grew older, became more de-
cidedly pious, as did also my Lord as he advanced
in years. And now, old as I am, I remember
with a delight which makes me sometimes break
out into hymns of praise and thanksgiving, how
sweetly these two were accustomed to commune
together on heavenly subjects, and how their re-
ligious principles were evidenced by their circum-
spect conduct. Still however my heart remained
in a state of great hardness. Sometimes indeed I

had strong convictions; but, as I before observed,
the world so blinded my eyes, as to render further
and greater privations necessary to my eternal good.
“These salutary afflictions, though long delayed,
at length overtook me. I first lost my Lord. His
death was sudden, but attended with such circum-
stances as a humble Christian may reflect upon
with satisfaction. And my son had hardly enter-
ed upon his estates and titles, when he was called
away from those empty possessions to an inheri-
tance which fadeth not away.
“With him went all my high hopes, together
with all those prospects of worldly happiness
which I had so long entertained; so that out of
all our immense possessions, this estate only re-
mained to me. This remnant of our former pro-
perty I then looked upon as an inconsiderable
thing; but I have since felt it to be far, far above
my highest deserts, and more than sufficient to
supply me not only with the necessaries, but even
with the choicest luxuries of life, had I been dis-
posed to require them.
“Upon the death of my son, I immediately re-
tired to this place, where I have now lived five-
and-thirty years, under a growing conviction, that
all my past chastisements were absolutely requi-
site to subdue my rebellious will, and bring me to
God. Yes, there has not been allotted me one
correction too much, nor one stroke too heavy.

More than this, I have learned to see, that in
God's dealings with me he has been peculiarly,
most abundantly, most amazingly merciful, yea,
merciful beyond even his usual mercies. I asked
the honours of this world for my husband and my
children, and he has given them instead thereof an
inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fad-
eth not away. (1 Peter i. 4.) I asked a stone
for them, and he gave them bread; I asked a ser-
pent, and he gave them a fish. (Matt. vii. 9, 10.)
Thus has he done for my husband and my chil-
dren; nor has he dealt less bountifully with my-
self, giving me in his house and within his walls
a place and a name better than of sons and of
daughters, even an everlasting name, that shall
not be cut off.” (Isaiah lvi. 5.)
When the Lady Faulconbridge had finished her
affecting history, there followed a silence of some
minutes; during which every one struggled to re-
press her own feelings, no one daring to speak,
lest any thing should escape her that might in-
crease the freshly revived sorrows of the noble
sufferer. At length Mrs. Teachum, who best knew
how to express herself on this occasion, ventured
to lay before her Ladyship some of those rich and
powerful consolations, which she herself, in some-
what similar circumstances, had drawn from re-
ligion.
The Lady Faulconbridge was very sensible of
Mrs. Teachum's kindness, and expressed a hope


## p. 249 (#261) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 249
that their acquaintance, thus agreeably commen-
ced, might only terminate with her death; which
event, she added, her advanced age led her to
suppose must be very near at hand.
Twilight, now fast approaching, reminded Mrs.
Teachum that it was time to take her leave: she
therefore directed her little companions to prepare
themselves for their walk. But the Lady Faulcon-
bridge would not permit them to go until she had
presented each of her young visitors with some
pretty little specimen of her own needle-work,
taken from the drawers of one of the Indian cabi-
nets before mentioned. To one she gave an em-
broidered pincushion; to another, a needle-book;
to a third, a little work-bag : in short, every one
received some little token of remembrance from
the hands of their venerable hostess. And there
was not one of the young ladies who did not duly
estimate her kindness; while all sincerely rejoiced
on hearing that they were invited to repeat their
visit in a few weeks.
During their walk home, the subject of their
conversation was, of course, wholly supplied by
what they had seen and heard; and all the way
their young hearts glowed with an ardent desire of
becoming like the lovely Lady Lucy Faulconbridge.
In this state of mind they retired to rest, and were
thus sweetly prepared for the duties of the follow-
ing day. -


## p. 250 (#262) ############################################

250 THE GOVERNESS; OR, THE
S UN ID A Y,
The last Day.
THIS sweet morning was ushered in by the ring-
ing of bells, inviting all persons to prepare for the
solemn services of the day. The morning was fine,
and the whole house was rendered fragrant with
the odour of the fresh flowers with which every
chimney-piece was adorned.
On assembling in Mrs. Teachum's presence, all
neatly dressed, and every countenance beaming
with holy peace and joy, the whole party cor-
dially joined in the morning song of praise, led
by their governess.
After having attended divine service twice, the
little party met in the evening, as usual, in Mrs.
Teachum's parlour, where they drank tea together:
after which they fell into discourse upon the events
of the past week, and the happiness they had en-
joyed for several days past. They spoke much of
those two lovely children, the Lady Lucy Faul-
conbridge, and the sweet Emily; nor did their
governess fail to point out to them wherein the
peculiar excellence of those characters consisted,


## p. 251 (#263) ############################################

LITTLE FEMALE ACADEMY. 251
namely, their freedom from selfishness. “In nei-
ther of these children,” said Mrs. Teachum, “was
there the smallest desire of being brought forward
into notice, or of indulging their own appetites
and passions; the comfort and happiness both of
their parents and their guardians was what they
earnestly and continually sought to secure; and
sueh was the sincerity of their love for them, that
death itself could not destroy it.” She then pro-
ceeded to observe, that these dear children were
by nature such as others; but that being renewed
by the Holy Spirit of God, they had become new
creatures: upon which she again took occasion to
enforce the necessity of seeking assistance from the
Holy Spirit, in order to do well. She thence went
on to remark, that whatever excellence may ap-
pear in any human character, it can be but as a
faint shadow of that, of which the dear Saviour's
character was the substance; exhorting them there-
fore daily to take their Lord's conduct, when on
earth, as the only perfect ensample of a holy life.
And here she set before them his wonderful humi-
lity, his compassion, his patience, his gentleness,
his entire freedom from every selfish feeling, his
contempt of earthly glory, his purity, and his in-
vincible fortitude. After dwelling for some time
upon these topics, she earnestly and affectionately
entreated the little company, that they would en-
deavour in all things to adorn the Gospel of God
their Saviour; concluding her address in the fol-
lowing words: “My beloved children, though our
house is set in a fragrant garden, though it is spa-

cious, and airy, and possessed of every desirable
convenience; though all our earthly wants are
here supplied even to abundance; though we pos-
sess health, and strength, and the society of our
friends: notwithstanding al these advantages, if
we live estranged from Christ, and set up Self as
our idol, we must needs be miserable—while, on
the other hand, a sense of the divine favour is of
itself sufficient to counterbalance the loss of every
worldly accommodation and comfort, as was ex-
emplified in the case of Daniel, who found peace
even in the lion's den, because his God was with
him there.”
